R3ME. March 3.â a. m.â lat
est news from the Vatican is that
the Pope's temperature at mid
night had fallen several- points.
It appears that his disinclination
to observe the recommendations of his
physicians forms. an obstacle in the way
of prompt recovery. He has full confi
dence in his own strength and does not
readily acquiesce in their advice not to
move.
During the afternoon he Insisted upon
leaving his bed without assistance and
read several telegrams. The rise in his
temperature, which had given some
anxiety, was probably caused in part in
this way.
The doctors exclude everybody from
his apartments except his personal at
tendants. Professor Mazzoni remained
in readiness during the evening to pro
ceed to the Vatican if needed, but up
to 11 o'clock he had not been called,
and at that hour he did not expect to
go until daybreak.
The Pope said during the day: "It Is
a miracle of God that I am still alive;
for He wishes to spare His church a
terrible crisis at the present moment."
At 5 o'clock in the afternoon the doc
tors made a prolonged visit lasting
more than an hour, which caused some
uneasiness, but on leaving they gave
reassuring reports, Professor Mazzoni
saying there was not the least fear
that the pleura, bronchial tubes or
lungs would be affected. The Pope's
nephews also visited him in the course
of the afternoon and left his chamber
.much pleased with his progress.
Despite these optimistic reports,
grave doubts are entertained as to the
issue of the illness. His Holiness, it
seems, displays great interest in the
matter, and has asked the doctors as to
the best way of preserving the cyst,
explaining that he intended, when he
shoul.d have recovered, to dissect it for
. purposes of study.
Cardinal Ledochowski. the Prefect of
the Congregation of the Propaganda,
consulted yesterday with Cardinal
Creglia, Dean of the Sacred College,
Camorlingo of the Holy Roman Church
and Prefect of the Congregation of
Ceremonial and Cardinal Mertel, Vice
Chancellor of the Holy Roman Church
and First Cardinal Deacon, who, in con
junction with Cardinal Ledochowski,
according to the apostolic constitutions,
' assumes the government of the church
in case of the Pope's death. *
When the doctors proposed applying
â¢the clinical thermometer yesterday his
Holiness said that there was no need
â¢ to do so, as he could himself feel thai
the fever had disappeared, just as he ]
could feel the high temperature prior !
to the operation.
The Pontiff would not allow the
- wound to be sewed up, so the doctors
' had to be content with drawing the
ends together in place.
After the wound had been dressed,
chatting quietly with Dr. Mazzoni, the
Pope smilingly said: "I want you to
cure me without any pain and in two
days."
The surgeon replied In the same
spirit: "Your Holiness must not ex
pect me to perform miracles."
â¢ The Pope for the present will partake
only of liquid nourishment, such as
' soup, raw eggs and watered wine. The
doctors positively deny that, there is
any dysentery or danger of blood poi
soning. ;
Dr. Mazzoni to-day said to a high
personage at the Vatican who asked
for confidential information on the sub
ject that if the Pope recovered, as he
fully expected, there was no reason why
. he should not live for another ten
years, so great is his vitality.
' " 9-30 p. mâ The Pope Is very cheerful,
â¢ and In an interested way asked the doc
tors from time to time what they
'thought of his condition. They reas
sured him. There has, however, been a
slight increase in his temperature, to
which the doctors attach some import
ance, although hoping it is only due
the nourishment he has taken. Dr.
""Lapponi remained in attendance at the
Vatican all night. \

The Caesar of South Africa Wants the
United States to Follow His Lead.
ALEXANDRIA, Egypt. March 2.â
Cecil Rhodes, who, in the eyes of
most Englishmen, Is the incarna
tion of the imperialistic policy,
holds views concerning the future
of the United States even more far
reaching that most American imperial
ists have broached. Mr. Rhodes, in
conversation with a representative of
the Associated Press on board . the
steamer Hapsburg on the Mediterran
ean, by which he came to Egypt in the
interest of the Cape to Cairo Railroad
and Telegraph line, predicted most con
fidently that within a century the
United States would have advanced the
work begun in the evacuation of Cuba
until it controlled all of . the American
hemisphere except Canada. The sub
stance of the conversation is repro
duced without, absolute verbal ac
curacy.
Mr. Rhodes expressed admiration of
the work already done in Cuba and pre
dicted that it would be carried on in
the Philippines. The United States he
considered' one of the nations best
equipped for colonization and repeated
ly exclaimed:
"You are taking to it like moth
er's milk, apparently with, the great
est delight."
He inquired what were the argu
ments of the opponents of imperialism
in the United States, and commented
that they seemed to be animated by
selfishness.
"It is the duty of civilized nations to
take charge of the barbarians and give
them a white man's government," he
said. "The United States is one of the
great powers and cannot escape this
duty."
He did not believe that the United
States would ever withdraw its
authority from Cuba, and thought the
manner in which Spain had been
evicted from her colonies and the
United States had taken possession
most businesslike. America's action in
compensating Spain for the Philip
pines surprised him.
"I would have bundled the Spaniards
out and made them pay a war
indemnity," was his. comment.
He declared that the United States
could never withdraw from the Phil
ippines because it was their duty to
give these people a strong and good
government, nor did he believe that
when they began to realize the results
of their work there Americans would
desire to abandon the policy. They
might grumble for a time over the ex
pense, hut that would be a "mere flea
bite" to a nation so rich. Why not
i abandon some of the expenses of the

pension list, which seems so unreason
ably large, if economy was necessary.
Even if a large navy must be built, the
United States could well afford one. So
far as the fear of provoking foreign en
tanglements and wars went, while Eng
land'and the United States stood to
gether and maintained their present
understanding, which was practically
an alliance, no combination of powers
dare menace them. To govern colonies
the United States must organize a staff
of, colonial officials, hut they would do
that as easily as they wpuld build a
new navy.
To the suggestion of the anti-im
perialists that . the Philippines would
be only the beginning of colonization,
he said:
"There are no more' islands of the sea
to be acquired. They are all taken up.
The territory of the savage races is
practically ail pre-empted by the civil
ized. The ultimate work of the United
States would be to govern South Amer
ica. You will probably begin with
Mexico, acquire the Central American
States, then those on the continent of
South America, until you hold all the
country to the south of you. These
states have incompetent governments â
practically barbarian governments â
and ft will be your duty to give them
the white man's government. Mexico
is well governed, but a nation cannot
depend upon one man and when Diaz
is dead it may be ruled no better than
before his time. Southward is the logi
cal direction of the expension of the
United States.
"The Philippines came to you by ac
cident; these neighboring peoples it will
be logically your duty to provide for."
When Blame's efforts to arrange a
friendly compact between the North
and South American republics were
mentioned Mr. Rhodes called them vis
ionary.
"You will possess all those states by
force of arms, and that within a cen
tury," he said, emphatically.
Asked if Canada would' logically be
included in this expansion, he said
Canada had a good Government and
therefore there was no need lor change.
Summarizing America's policy, he
said:
"You people of the United States
cannot always remain within your
selves. You cannot always go on
making money. You must get out Into
the world and' take up your share of
the world's burdens. Already you are
outgrowing your country, and you will
absorb other countries and you will
give them good government. . Why
should you not? You have it in your
blood. The Philippines will furnish
new -careers for your young men. The
whole work will strengthen you and
broaden your national character. Yes,
already you are taking to it like
mother's milk."

NEW YORK, March 2.â A special
cable to the World from Berlin says:
Professor Wasserman, one of Professor
Koch's ablest pupils, is believed to have
discovered a new serum for the cure of
pneumonia. He inoculated, rabbits
with the bacillus which is generally be
lieved to cause pneumonia, and with
the serum thus gained he inoculated
mice suffering from pneumonia. A
subsequent series of experiments
showed it was in the red marrow of the
bones that antitoxin is produced, and
that red marrow taken from a human
corpse after death from pneumonia and
used as a serum will cure mice in
fected with that disease. Accordingly
it is hoped, that this serum will have
the same satisfactory results in human
beings. "

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, March 2.â a
speech made to his supporters to-day Dan Burns made the
following- statement:
"In spite of the charges that have been made
against meâ every possible charge that the press
could inventâ l defy any man to bring up one
charge against me of any wrongdoing."
The Grand Jury of Sacramento County returned twelve in
dictments against Burns for the fraudulent application of State
funds in his charge during the time he was Secretary of State. He
was arrested and imprisoned. In the course of the trial, in which
Burns' only defense was an attempt to fasten the crimes of which
he was accused on a deputy who had been selected by him for hi*
proficiency in political and other roguery, Burns admitted that he
had deliberately falsified the books of his office to cover up the
shortage in his accounts. Here is his admission, made under oath:
"I took the memorandum cash book and
changed these figures or amounts. I did not
change the figures, but where there would be
$13 25 I marked $9 75, and I took this cash book
back to him (Deputy Gale) after the Bth day of De
cember some timeâ it must have been three or
four days afterward."
This is one of the charges that have been made against
Burns. If it is not wrong to falsify the books. of a public office
for the purpose of concealing a shortage in the. public funds, then
Dan Burns, the Southern Pacific Company's candidate for United
States Senator, has done no wrong.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SAC
RAMENTO, March 2.â The Burns
men in the Legislature held a
caucus to-day and listened to an
address from . their chief.
It was a notable occasion. for many
reasons. It was the first outward and
visible evidence that Burns has shown
that he realizes his own weakness as a
candidte; it established the Candelaria
candidate's reputation as an orator,
and it was the formal declaration that
Burns serves on the Legislature that
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
he will force the Republican members
into a caucus or he will prevent the
election of a United States Senator. In
the presence of his supporters he an
nounced ; that he was in the fight to stay
until a Republican caucus should select
some other candidate. His supporters
then formally pledged themselves to
vote for him until a Republican caucus
shall select another man.
To put It in plain terms Burns and
his supporters took a solemn pledge
that they would prevent the election of
a United States Senator unless the Re
publican members of the Legislature
agreed to go into a caucus. In other
words Burns and his men have de
clared that unless their orders are car
ried out they will wreck the Republican
party and rob the State of California of
a representative in the upper house of
Congress.
Here is Burns' declaration:
"Now, I am in this fight and I shall
stay until the majority of the Repub
licans in caucus shall select some other
candidate."
Here is the pledge taken by all of the
twenty-seven legislators who are now
voting for Burns for Senator:
"Resolved, That "we pledge ourselves
to vote for Colonel D. M. Burns for
United States Senator to succeed Hon.
Stephen M. White until by a majority
vote of a caucus of the Republican
members a Senator shall be nom
inated."
Heretofore Burns has ruled his sup
porters with the iron hand of a master
and they have obeyed every order with
the blind faith of slaves. But recently
there have been murmurs of discontent
and threats of insurrection, and realiz
ing the danger impending Burns was
forced to call his men together for the
first time since the beginning of the
session and make known his wishes by
word of mouth instead of through the
medium of his lieutenants. It was an
evidence of weakness en the part of
Burns, but it had to be done in order
to enable him to stem the growing tide
of discontent and make it possible for
him to carry out his threat to prevent
the election of a Senator in case the
Legislature refused to elect him.
The caucus was held immediately af
ter the adjournment of the joint As
sembly at 12:30 o'clock. It was called
hurriedly and apparently because of a
fear that there would be a break from :
the Burns column, for word was sent
in to Assemblyman Dibble, and he in
turn made a personal appeal to the
Grant and Barnes leaders on the floor
not to force a second ballot. Word
was then circulated among the Burns
followers to meet their chief in caucus
in the Supreme Court room immediate
ly after adjournment. Word was also
sent to Major Frank McLaughlin, who
was downtown, to come to the Capitol
immediately and attend the caucus.
Twenty-seven legislators. Burns' full
voting strength, assembled at the
designated place in response to the
summons. â¢â  â 
Short addresses were made by As

and Senators Shortridge, Wolfe and

which all lauded the lovely character
and high purpose of their chief. They
urged all of his supporters to stand
firm and turn a deaf ear to the lyiner
attacks of the newspapers, for by do
i ing so they would be performing a2

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March _.â Burns is busy
rallying his own men. He ex
hibited to-day the first outward
evidence of weakening. He cabled
his supporters together in caucus for
the first time and sought to cheer them
and obtain pledges of further support;
At the beginning of the joint session
, to-day Assemblyman Dibble went to
Senators Morehouse and Bulla with a
request that only one ballot should be
'taken. Dibble said: "1 ask it as a per
sonal favor that you do not hold us up
for more than one ballot to-day. I
know that you can do it if you try."
After the ballot was announced Dib
ble made a motion to adjourn, and no
resistance was offered by the Bijlnes
and Grant forces. Immediately after
the adjournment Burns summoned his
men to meet in the Supreme Court
room, and there he and Major Mc-
Laughlin addressed them. Burns made
one of his characteristic speeches, in
which the people and the party were
ignored, and his own personal feeling
Introduced as the chief consideration of
the hour. He spoke of the attacks of
the press, remarking that his self-re
spect and manhood required him to re
main in' the contest until a caucus de
clared that he was not the choice of
the party. He seemed to be utterly un
conscious of the great truth that the
people of California in general and the
voters of the Republican party in par
ticular have a deep and earnest'con
cern in the Senatorial contest. The fact
that California ought to have a Senator
to succeed Mr. White seemed to cut no
figure in the calculations of D. M.
Burns. He thought only of himself and
his desire for vindication.
He talked of a caucus, when knowl
edge'of party custom should teach him
that he has no right to submit his name
to a party caucus, and a caucus, should
one be called, would have no right to
consider his peculiar claims. According
to his own statements made to his fol
lowers he did not enter the contest in
good faith to serve the people, but en
tered the race to punish the press and
get even on his enemies. Had the an
nouncement been made by himself, be
fore, the members of the Legislature
were voted for by the people, that he
would be a candidate for United States
Senator he might with some degree of
fairness now ask that his name be sub
mitted with those of other candidates
for caucus consideration. But his' as
pirations for the office of Senator were
not disclosed until after the election.
In fact his motives in this respect were
hidden from the people. If the people
had believed that the Republican Leg
islature would commit the political folly
of seriously voting for him for Senator
the Republican ticket headed by Henry
T. Gage for Governor, down to the last
man on the legislative ticket, would
have been beaten out of sight. And
Burns has the effrontry to demand a
caucus of the people's* representatives
after he had concealed from the people
the fact that he designed to become a
candidate. ".'â¢';_ :': '-
Burns to-day has made his one speech
of the Senatorial campaign, and when
the people of California read and con
sider it they will comprehend that there
is nothing in his claims for the Sena
torship beyond a selfish desire to get
even with his assailants. It is not the
time in the history of this State and
this nation to send a man to the United
States Senate solely because that man
has enemies to punish and friends to
reward. Burns' own admissions testify
to the low plane on which his canvass
is conducted. He is now shaking his
fist at the people of California and say
ing, "A caucus must be held to con
sider my claims or no Senator shall
he elected by this Legislature." ,
The Burns steering committee ap
pointed by the cc-lonel's caucus to-day

high moral duty. The room was full
of noble sentiments and hieh ideals,
and the fog of unsullied principle was
so thick that it was with difficulty that
such members as Wright, Simpson and

After the resolution above quoted had
been adopted Burns named Johnson.

members of the Legislature, -promul

State.' This address will set forth the
reasons why Burns should be consid
ered the greatest of living Americans:
why it is that all of the misdeeds that
have been charged against him are un
true and should be considered as pine
dreams; why he would adorn the
United States Senate and lend bril
liancy to the assemblage where such
men as Webster, Clay. Calhoun. Ben
ton and Blame have j sat, and why
every one else Is wrong and he is
right. â¢;.../.,.
At the conclusion of these interesting
details of the meeting Burns delivered
his maiden address. It was as follows:
"Gentlemen: As you all know, I was'
not in the first place a candidate for
Senator. I d*d not go into this fight un
til forced to by repeated' and .vilifying
attacks by the press. It was never my

aspire â¢to "such a" position, the -highest,
The battle for the people has been
won so far as the danger of Burns' elec
tion is concerned, but it is by no means
settled that a Senator will be chosen.
"Burns or nobody" is the cry of the
touts and they fling the challenge de
fiantly in the face of the Republican
party. There may be a union of the
forces of Barnes, Grant and Scott in
behalf of the people of the State, but
the Grant, men believe that duty re
quires them to ' present an unbroken
front in order to defeat any tricky
scheme of the Burns men.
Senator Currier, who has been laid up
with sickness at his home near Los
Angeles for the last two weeks, will
probably return to his post of duty
early next week. It Is regarded as cer
tain that he will cast his vote for Gen
eral Barnes, as he was one of Senator
Bulla's gallant supporters. Mr. Bulla
is in receipt of many telegrams from
Southern California commending his
course in casting the weight of his in
fluence in favor of General Barnes. It
is presumed -that Senator Currier is
well advised as to the sentiments of the
people of the southern part of the State
in reference .to the struggle now in
progress.
Assemblyman La Baree, who voted for
Bulla, has not been seen around the
Capitol or about any of the hotels since
yesterday forenoon. There have been
many inquiries regarding his where
abouts. --''^ ,'. â 
Burns began his Senatorial campaign
by deceiving the people, and is now
trying to deceive his supporters. He
did not tell them the truth to-day when
he submitted that he became a candi
date because the newspapers assailed
him. He was not assailed until he was
announced by Herrin as the railroad's
candidate. He is not able to compre- ;
hend that the Senatorshlp should be !
placed on a higher plane than mere per
sonal controversy.
"What right has Colonel Burns to de
mand that California shall not have
adequate representation in the con
gress of the United States until he is
vindicated? with equal rights. Wright.
Simpson and Jilson might apply to the
Legislature for high official honor as a
measure of vindication. What Burns
is pleased to speak of as vilification
consists in the publication of his own
official record. He made the record for
himself and should stand by it or fall
by it. If he desires to be vindicated
why does he not pay into the State
treasury the sum of 531,000 belonging to
the State, which was stolen from his
office while he was Secretary of State?
Men had better repent and make resti
tution before demanding vindication.
The course of D. M. Burns in this
Senatorial contest and the defiant
threat of his henchmen that this State
shall not be represented in Congress
until he is vindicated are calculated to
arouse the people irrespective of party
to a sense of responsibility in the
premises.
In his talk before his followers to
day Burns did not advance- any claims
for promotion to the high office of
United States Senator as a reward for
meritorious service rendered by him
self to the State or to the Republican
party. He could not put forth such
a claim. For all that he ever did for
the cause of Republicanism the party
has given him rewards and emolu
ments far beyond his desert. It made
him Secretary of State and it made
him Police Commissioner of San Fran
cisco. After such reward he bolted
the party nominations in San Fran
cisco and joined the non-partisan
movement with his Tocaloma Club
and defeated Republican candidates
for the Legislature. His bolting course
gave the Legislature to the Democrats
six years ago and gave that party a
Senator when the Republican party was
fairly and honestly entitled to the re

FRAGRANT COYOTE
BILL HAS PASSED
THE SENATE
A Scathing Analysis of the
Measure by One Familiar
With Its Provisions,
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 2.â The coyote scalp j
bill of fragrant memory has passed the
Senate and is now ready to be called
up in. the Assembly. It carries an ap
propriation of $257,615, and also con
tains provisions which, it is claimed,
gives the speculators and syndicates (
holding bounty certificates a decided j
advantage over the individual claim
ants. It is acknowledged that there
| are some just and honest claims mixed
in with bunches of fraudulent certifi
cates.
The Call has received the following
opinion of the pending measure from
one who has studied its provisions:
It robs the State. ' â ' .
It furnishes no relief to small claim
ants.
It enriches the speculators who have ac
cumulated blocks of fraudulent <.ia.....7,
and in whose interests substitute for ben
ate bill 227 has been cunningly drawn.
It would overwhelm the Attorney Gen- j
eral with a multiplicity of actions which j
he could never find time to defend; or if
he had the time it would involve enor- I
mous expense and create a corresponding
deficiency and be abortive as to any re- :
sults beneficial to the State or to those
deserving the benefits of legislation.
In short, the State would be at the
mercy of "holders" and honest owners
would be given no remedy.
A volume might be written upon the I
iniquities apparent upon the face of toe j
substitute, which in some inscrutable
way has passed the Senate. - .â : -'Â» >â ;
But as there is no time to read volumes
on this subject, what is here presented
may be fittingly entitled "An invitation
to thought and examination."
First, after the facts and conditions j
calling for legislation upon this subject:
From Kern, San Luis Obispo, Modoc, Las
sen and perhaps one or two of the other
counties, claims have been presented in
greater numbers than there are inhabi
tants and sheep sought to be protected
by the coyote bounty act of 1891. The to
tal of scalps claimed to have been taken ;
in the State is 57,523, which number is
found by dividing the sum for which ,
claims have been presented to the State |
Board of Examiners, namely, $287,615, by i
five ($5 being the bounty on each scalp I
under the said act of 1891). ;..â ..'
Over two-thirds of the certificates is- I
sued by the County Clerks under the said
: act are in about half a dozen hands, in
cluding banks and San Francisco law |
firms. The balance are scattered through- j
out half the counties of the State. â¢ Tnat .
the larger proportion of these "demands"
are base frauds is an admitted fact.
But the fraudulent claims are in strong I
hands, while the owners of honest claims
are in the hands of the original claim
ants, who rejected the picayune sums of
fered by the sharks and junk dealers;
and they still hold them. The latter, have
no remedy under the Senate substitute.
Now, suppose the Senate substitute
passes and is approved and a Bakers
field bank or a San Francisco law firm
files suit on a $50,000 block of County
Clerks' certificates. A trial comes on.
The Attorney General comes Into court
"to defend such suits," as provided in
section 2 of the substitute, "the holder"
offers in evidence this massive wad Of
Clerks' certificates, which, being the very
evidence prescribed bylaw, the court must
admit it, and that makes a prima facie
case against the State; and the Attorney
General is helpless. When and how is
he to obtain any competent evidence to ;
rebut or refute the case thus made? Let
there be remembered that there is at least |
$200,000 of claims so held. -â â â â -;>. .-..-
I And the next thought is as to the effect \
! upon State finances. The substitute makes
an immediate appropriation, and provides !
(section 5) as follows: "Upon presentation j
of a certified copy of such Judgment to
the State Controller the Controller shall |
draw his warrant upon the appropriation |
provided for the purpose for one-half the j
amount of such judgment payable out of
such fund for the then current fiscal year;
and thereafter, during the next ensuing
fiscal year the Controller shall In like man
ner draw his warrant for the remaining
half of such judgment, payable out of
such fund for such ensuing fiscal year."
Now, this Senate substitute, if passed
and approved, will take effect and become
a law of the State before the Ist of April.
The holders of great blocks of these certi
ficates will, in spite of anything the At
torney General can do to prevent it, ob
tain judgment and present a certified copy
thereof to the Controller during the pres
ent fiscal year, which ends on the 30th
day of June, 1899, and take out one hun
dred thousand dollars. Then on the 2d
day of July, 1899, they may demand and
collect the balance of their said Judg
ments. So under the substitute they can
within three months deplete the State
treasury to the tune of about two hun
dred thousand dollars. But not so with
the small holders, who cannot prenare for
trial in so short a time, even if they could
bear the expense, and they must sell at
whatever price the monopoly offers. In
this connection comes the suggestion in
defense of the substitute that they may
assign their demands to one another with
out litigation in their own names. Can
there be any doubt as to the class of per
sons who would busy themselves in pro
curing assignments for these purposes and
at what sacrifices to the small owners?
The substitute provides no actual notice
to any one of his right to sue the State,
nor any safeguards against an unauthor
ized appearance for claimants who have
died, removed or disappeared during the
last eight years, or against claims held in
wholly fictitious names; nor does it provide
any fund to the Attorney General for ob
taining evidence and procuring the at
tendance of witnesses for the State; nor
does it enable him to make any defense
whatever. He will be utterly powerless
in the premises; and those who are "hold
ers" of the thousands of alleged claimants
who in fact have never existed will have
it all their own way. The substitute pro
vides that the ordinary rules of practice
shall apply to such : suits against the
State, "except as herein otherwise pro
vided, with the right of appeal to either
party." The only exception therein mili
tates strongly against the small owner,
and Is in effect that he shall employ his
own attorney and pay a large bill of costs
and expenses. He would have to have
depositions taken or be compelled to. at
tend court with his witnesses time and
again in Sacramento.' Of course, the ob
stacles to obtaining any of the benefits
of , the substitute by any such persons
would be insurmountable. In short, they
are by the substitute, as it was intended
that they should be. left to the mercy of
those who have already combined and
laid their plans to acquire the balance of
the claims at their own price. â 'â¢'?-â¢,;;*

Under a vote to reconsider Johnson's
Assembly bill 651, to appoint an agent to
collect certain war claims of the State
upon the Federal Government and due
since the Rebellion, the measure was
passed by as good a majority as the one
which beat it two days ago. There was
some objection to pay the 10 percent com

considered a good business proposition,
particularly as the claims have been
hanging uncollected for the past thirty
years, and the commission is not to be
paid until the' money Is collected.
Shortridge's Ã¼biquitous horseshoe bill
came up for reconsideration of the vote
by which it was defeated, and just

THE GOVERNOR'S
VETO OVERRULED
BY SENTIMENT
Assembly Adopts the Poppy as
the State Flower Despite
Executive Objection.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO,' March 2.â Sentiment dwelt for a
time in the Assembly chamber this morn
ing; a golden, poppy-colored emotion, that
made men for a time forget their politics
and the sordid things that men go in for
here "in this Legislature and put their
hearts and their votes into a delicate
tribute to the memory of the only daugh
ter of one of their fellow members.
It was the selection of a State flower
that drove out politics and clarified the
usual sodden atmosphere. For years there
has been a ; desire to select some native
blown blossom that would best, typify the
past, the present and the hidden future of
the State, and when â¢ this session was
younger, and cleaner Assemblyman Bliss
of Oakland offered a bill adopting the
"golden poppy" as the floral symbol of
the commonwealth.
Though he did not say so when the
measure was introduced; it was neither
more nor less than a memorial to his only
child, his daughter.
The too few years of her life she .had
spent in the wondrous garden that nature
has given' California, learning by heart
the stories and the mysteries of the blos
som.. She told them- again to the little
children of - the schools, and everywhere
she preached the "gospel of the gardens:
and Of all the multitude of posies that
?rew in them the "golden poppy" was her
avorite. To her it embodied the gold of
the hills and the gold of the sunsets, and
bore mute promise of the future. It. was
the State's natural symbol and she prayed
that the State adopt it for Its own. But
one day when the suns of sutnmer had
burned the poppies from the hills she toft
lowed them, and left only her father to
greet them when the next year came, and
urge their cause to a commonwealth not
builded on sentiment.
A glimmer of it all went through this
Legislature when Mr. Bliss offered the
bill. It. went through to the Governor with
no, question and no dissent; but there it
found neither sentiment nor a conception
of anything less gross than cold legisla
tion. Mr, Gage vetoed it and so informed
the Assembly.
' To-day his veto came up on the files,
and Grove L. Johnson told his colleagues
just why the bill was drafted.
Said he: "This is purely a matter of
sentiment. It Is neither a thing this State
needs nor a thing it needs not. It is sim
ply something it wantsâ a beautiful con
ception. It is more; it is a memorial of
fered by our loved brother. Mr. Bliss of
Alameda, to his only daughter, who died
loving the poppy, and its fairest champion.
She wanted this State to adopt the flower
and she never tired of urging it, and you
of us who have daughters will know what
this bill means and see that it shall be
come a law." -â¢** .
Assemblymen Caminetti Of Amador and
Meade of Los Angeles followed Mr: John
son, and when the veto came up to a vote
it got nearly enough against it to nullify
it. notwithstanding there were scarce af
many in the -House as were needed. But
the absentees were called, and as the
tardy ones began to arrive and when they
had been retold the story they -stood up
and voted for the flower. The Democrats
threw off political courtesy, and when th_
last count of the vote was announced
there were more than enough to over
rule the Governor's objection and send
the measure to the Senate.
Notice Of the Assembly's action was at
once sent to the Senate, and later Senator
Shortridge called it up; but politics
played a stronger hand than sentiment
In the upper house, and the Governor's
â¢veto was sustained there by a vote of 33
to 2.
SENATE SAYS NO
TAXES FOR STANFORD
UNIVERSITY
. CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- j
MENTO, March- The constitutional
amendment allowing the Legislature to
exempt property of Stanford University
from taxation passed the Senate to-day,
but not without opposition or criticism.
The amendment originated in the As
sembly, and when It came to the -Senate
Morehouse and Shortridge, the two Sena
tors from Santa Clara County, stood \
ready to support it. The recommendation j
of the Committee on Judiciary, to which j
it was referred, was that the amendment |
"do not pass," but that did, not prevent j
Senator Shortridge from rising when the j
measure was reached on the file and ask
ing that it pass the Senate.
Shortridge, Morehouse and Simpson !
were all in favor of the amendment, and j
they said so to the extent of half an hour.
It was a public school, practically, was
the burden of their argument, an institu- j
tion formed for the public welfare and not '
for profit, and there was danger that un- J
less aid were granted it in the way of re
lease from taxation the welfare of the
institution would be seriously endangered
for lack of funds. It has now an Income '
of $180,000 a year, and one-fourth of this ',
is needed for taxes. The faculty costs I
$165,000, and it was remarked that be
tween the faculty and the tax there was
a deficit for ea^h year, without including
general expenses. â¢..-. r-^-; :v *â  : .
Senator Gillette opposed the amend
ment, both because of the provision al
lowing the exemption of property and be
cause of that clause which allows the
Legislature to confer, by special act, cor
porate powers upon the trustees of the
Institution. This privilege, he said, was
one which is allowed no other institution
in the State, and is directly opposed to
the principle asserted in the constitution
that ho special acts shall be passed by the
Legislature. -
â¢ Referring to the lack of funds, Senator
Gillette placed the hottest . shot that
struck the amendment. He said he had
heard that at one time there was $12,000,
--000 in taxable securities belonging to : the
Stanford estate in New York, and that it
had been moved from there and Is now
somewhere in the country producing no
revenue and taxable in this State if -the
securities could only be located. He sug
gested that two or three millions of
these securities be made to produce
some revenue and help the. university in
that way. . :. .;. â Â ' : â  : *-fi : :,'â¢-â¢ "i 'â â â 
Continuing, Senator Gillette said there
Were over 85,000 acres of land in Califor
nia belonging to the university that could
not be settled upon nor sold, and was
practically closed to the people, and he
did not think it should be exempted from
taxation. â  _ -, ,
Senator Smith did not believe in aiding
the Stanford University so long as the
State institution was so badly in aid of
__.ss.-*Â»t ni-Co.
Senator Rowell said the question was
the entering wedge for the exemption of
all property of benevolent or educational
institutions, and he believed it was a
dangerous experiment. He believed itwas
bad policy to allow any institution to in
vest its funds in taxable property and
then exempt the property from taxation.
Stratton, Curtin and Boyce spoke in fa
vor of the amendment, if, only to allow
the people of the State to vote upon it.
The roll was called, and the amendment
was adopted by a vote of 29 to 7, Rowell,
Gillette, Smith, La Rue, Jones Luchsin
ger and Trout voting no
Senator Gillette's words caused all
â¢kinds of a time among the supporters of
the measure, and there -were a great
many who were in the lobby when the
Senator from Humboldt made his sensa
tional charge. There were explanations
made by every one, and none explained
more loudly nor longer than the luckless
Crothers. who was credited with the or
iginal statement. .- _ ;? ' ; ,_ â 
He explained that what he had said to
Senator Rowell was not that Mrs. Stan
ford had hidden away all these securi
ties but that they belonged to another
estate, the name of which he did not
care to mention. But he insisted that
the securities were not of the Stanford
f 3 L__ _0 ;V **'â Â»*-? '
: President Jordan also. took time just be
fore the train left for the city to declare
that the statement that Mrs. Stanford
had any securities hiuden away from the
Tax Collector, as made on the floor of
the Senate, was an absolute falsehood.
What Crothers declared he did say to
Senator Rowell was this: He represented
that the Stanford estate was invested in
poorly paying securities and in poorly
paying land, and- that if her (Securities
were taxed .there would be nothing left
as an income from them to do the uni
versity any good. Her securities were
held outside this State, he said, and she
could not bring them here because they
would then come under this tax that
would rob them of so much of their pos
sibilities as revenue. To Illustrate his
point, he made use of the disastrous In
stancethat he knew of one estate that
had securities amounting to over $12,000,
--000, but that they could not be brought
here and were- now somewhere between
here and New York, and that they were
not being taxed. â¢
When, however. Crothers and Senator
Gillette had a conversation on the ex
emption. Senator Gillette understanding
the conversation to, refer to the Stanford
estate, demanded what amount In securi
ties had been "lost" on the. way from
New York, and Crothers would not tell,
arid when he was asked to deny the re
port that they amounted to over $12,000.
--000 he refused to do so. His method of
lobbying has cost the measure a. good
deal of dignity, and perhaps has caused
it. more trouble. - ,â :/-,

either Burns or Grant under any circum

Paterson coming to the front I will vote
for him. Next to him I consider General
Barnes the best man. I think that this
is the proper time for Paterson to come
to the front, for it seems to me to be as
much of a deadlock as ever. I don't see
how Barnes can win unless he gets sup
port from some of the other camps, but,
nevertheless, I consider him the next best

WORKING TO SAVE THE p
MINERAL LAND BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 2.â The evening session
of the Senate was broken In upon by an
interruption from Washington. -It -was a
telegram from Marlon de Vries in which
he asked the California Legislature . to
take some action, and take it at once, in
order that he might get the mineral land
bill, of so much importance to the miners
of California, before Congress. The end
of the session was near, he wired, and
any action that was taken must be im
mediate to be of any etfect.
Senator Davis was given the telegram
and he fixed up the following- resolution:
"Resolved, By the Senate and Assemoiy
of the State of California, jointly, that we
earnestly urge immediate consideration of
the mineral land bill now pending in Con
gress, and respectfully request Hon. T.
B. Reed. Speaker of the House of Rep
resentatives, to recognize some member
of the California delegation to - call tne
same up for consideration before the close
of the present session. Â<â¢;"-. :â 
"Resolved, That the secretary of the Sen
ate be Instructed to transmit by, telegraph
a copy of the foregoing resolution to tne
Speaker of the House of Representatives
at Washington, D. C."
In submitting the resolution Davis
asked that a vote suspending the rules
he taken and that his resolution be adopt
ed and wired back to Washington- at
once. It looked as if this would be done,
but Braunhart arose and asked why the
Legislature of California should bow down
before the Czar of the House and beg him
to recognize a representative from Cali
fornia. He was answered by Davis, who
said he thought it was no time for "petty
peanut politics." and he had no 'answer
except to call for the roll call. Braunhart
explained that it was. to, the form. of the
resolution that he objected, not to the
sentiment it expressed, and so he would
Vote for it anyway, which he did. There
was not a dissenting voice and. the resolu
tion went through in a moment.
The mineral land bill now before Con
gress is one which segregates from the
land granted to the Central Pacific Rail
road Company- all lands which have been
found to contain mineral deposits, and
lays them open to settlement by miners,
giving the railroad other lands in lieu or
those taken under the act.
NO MORE JUNKETS
AT STATE EXPENSE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 2.â There will be no
junket to Agnews this week, for the Sen
ate has ruthlessly sat down upon -the
scheme, and the traveling element will
have to stay around Sacramento or pay
its own way out.
Senator Laird submitted a resolution
granting leave of absence to three mem
bers from each of the committees on
finances, hospitals and public buildings
from Saturday at 2 o'clock to Monday at
half-past 11, with all the necessary trav
eling expends between here and Agnews
The resolution aroused the sense of hu
mor which lies dormant generally in the
Senate, and the Senators proceeded to
have some at its expense. Senator Smith,
however, injected a little hard sense Into
th<-discuesion when he said he was a mem
ber of two .of the committees which were
to be represented in the junket and he

NO PROTECTION FOR
: '.-. TIMID CANDIDATES
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 2.â The woes of the last
"conference" were thrashed over in the
Senate this afternoon' with the considera
tion of Dibble's bill to protect timid can
didates a's a basis for argument.
Dibbles bill provides that any candi
date who takes a pledge to vote for any
particular person for United States Sen
ator or any one who asked a legislator or
legislative candidate to do so. shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. There
is a law already on the books making it
an offense to exact or take a pledge, and
Dibble's bill added the question of Sena
tor to make that a sure thing. The Sen
ate had no use for- the measure, how
ever, and by a vote of 30 to 4 the bill was
defeated. -
Shortridge opposed the bill in the first
place because he said he .thought it right
and just that every one should know ex
actly how a man was going to represent
his constituents, and there was only one
way of making that sure. Davis was
also redhot after the bill. He brought m
the present situation by declaring that he
felt his people had a right to know bow
he was going to vote on the question j of
a United States Senator and on other Im
portant measures, and. he had pledged
himself on every stump in his county on
any question he understood, except those
affecting the judiciary. He thought that
if a man did not wish to pledge himself
he should assert his manhood, to- which
Senator Curtin, who favored the bill, said
"yes, and give up his ambition." .
. Curtin pointed to the. present^ condition
of affairs in the joint ballot, and declared
that If it were not for the pledges taken
before the election by the various candi
dates there would have been no deadlock
and a Senator would have been elected
long before this. "We have been here for
sixty days." he said, "and have lost an
immense amount of time balloting for a
Senator, and all because of these > ante
election pledges. How long is this going to
continue? Are we going on to witness the
disgraceful scenes we have witnessed da*,
after day in the joint session? Pledges
control all political bodies, and it has got
so now that you cannot succeed in an
election unless you have been tied down
by all kinds of pledges." Â_ââ - +Vl -
"Morehouse preferred to designate the
Senatorial bugbear as A. B. "If my con;
stttuents do not want A. B. for Senator,
he declared, "they have a right to demand
of me that I do not vote for A. 8.. and
I I have no right to violate that pledge. I
I have no "right to come here and vote for
I a man for Senator when. I know in my
! heart mv constituents are opposed to that
| man for United States Senator. I am op
; posed to this bill. It is, conceived in. sin,
born in iniquity and if passed will be
passed wrongly." '_,"?' âÂ«Â«..
There was no fear of its passage how
ever and after an amendment including
boards of Supervisors in the pledge pro
; hibition had. been submitted anil with
! drawn, because the bill already had such
| a provision, the measure was snowed

ground that the exposition will benefit
only San Francisoo or the immediate vi

Quite a number of those gentlemen who
came from San Francisco to support the
bills left last night, with the impression
that the bills were in a fair wav to pass,
evidently thinking that the bills would
meet with .approval by the committee, but
by that body's action this morning It
would seem that the gentlemen were la
boring under a delusion.
The report of the committee was read
in the Senate this morning and the bills
placed on file. They will probably not
take the regular course, but will be hur

FREE MARKET TO
GO TO THE SEAWALL
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 2.â So far as the Senate
is concerned the free market will not be
on the corner of Davis and Pacific streets
in San Francisco. It- will be on section
4of the seawall. An amendment to Lang
ford's free market bill providing for the
change in the site was adopted this even
ing, despite the opposition of Cutter and
Langford, and with the assistance of Ma
jor McLaughlin, who has been persistently
lobbying against the bill in its original
form whenever he had time to spare from
Ms diminishing share in the Senatorial
fight. Senator Stratton proposed the
amendment moving the site for the addi
tion to the free market from the lot lying
between Pacific street, Davis and the
water front to section 4 of the seawall.
Dickinson spoke first on the amendment,
saying the site originally mentioned was
occupied by the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company and was paying the State a
rental of $600 a month throughout the
year, and by the bill it was intended to
oust the company to make way for a â 
traffic which would pay but for three or
four months.
Cutter read several resolutions passed
by the Supervisors, the Chamber or Com- |
merce, the State Grange and the Fruit
Growers' convention, all of which recom
mended the site on Davis and Pacific I
streets. Btratton explained that improve- ;
ments valued at $50,900 would have to be j
removed or given up by the company, and
showed that the site on the seawall was
Just as good and quite as close to the cen- ;
ter of trade so far as transportation was
concerned as the one the original bill se
lected.
Others spoke on the question princi- [
pal";.- on the subject of the railway facil- !
ities, which Senator Langford explained j
â¢was what the farmers most wanted, and j
then the amendment went to a vote. It j
had but little to spare when the vote was
â¢announced J but the amendment had car
ried and the bill was laid over until it
could be printed.
TUTOR GAGE STILL

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA

engaged in teaching rhetoric to the untu

brought vetoes to more proposed laws
this year than has bad policy. It killed

Mr. Gage's message on one of them is
as follows:
I herewith return to your honorable body,

my objection thereto.

It purports to permit full satisfaction to be ;

Mr. Gage's other message disapproves

This hill amends section 1050 of the Code of
Civil Procedure by adding thereto the follow
ing words: "And In such action any defense I
may he made by plaintiff to such claim which j
he "would be entitled to make were an action i
brought by the defendant against the plaintiff." ,
If the language of this amendment Is to bear .
the most favorable construction, then It adds '
nothing to the strength of the original sec- j
tlon, for this has been the -settled law upon I
the subject.
It is, however, capable of a construction ;
which might give to plaintiff In such action j
a defense which would have the effect to defeat â

THE CATHEDRAL MISSION.
Interesting History of the Rise of the
Charitable Institution.
The year book of the Cathedral Mission
of the Good Samaritan, just issued, gives
an interesting history of the mission from
its foundation and a record of the work
done in the past year.
The mission was first opened on May
4, 1894, at 249 Second street, its object
being the entertainment of men and boys
in the neighborhood. It consisted of but
five rooms, and was looked alter by a
delegation from the Brotherhood of St.
Andrew. ,
It was a success from the start, and a
year after its opening a subscription was
started to raise funds for the erection of
a new building. The sum of $Â«.Â«>â¢> was
raised, and on December 27, ISM, the cor
ner-stone was laid for the chapel and mis
sion house. Later the adjoining lot was
purchased, and the corner building, con
taining sixty-five rooms, was leased and
fitted up for the working boys. The mis
sion was crowned with success from the
start, but the question of finance has ever
been a vexing one. About $5000 will be
needed to carry on the work during the
coming year, and it is hoped to raise this
by subscription.

MORMON LEADER HERE.
President Joseph F. Smith. Regrets
the Utah Legislative
Scandal.
President Joseph F. Smith, leader of
the Mormon sect in Zion, Utah, who has
been for some time in Honolulu on busi
ness connected with his church, has ar
rived in this city and is staying at the
Grand Hotel. With him are Mrs. Smith
and his two nieces.
"I regret that my visit to the islands."
said Mr. Smith, "compelled me to be ab
sent at the very time the Senatorial fight
was going on in Utah. I deeply deplore
the scandal that has arisen in the case.
No matter whether the charges of brib
ery against A. W. McCune are proven or
not, McCune cannot go to the Senate un
tainted. Although I consider him a good
friend of the Mormon church, still we
hardly care to assume the responsibility
of his election.
"As to Congressman-elect Roberts, I
honor him for his fidelity to his covenants
and his devotion to his church, but I think
his election at this time Is a mistake.
However, the people wanted him, and
they are responsible and not the church."
President Smith addressed the Mormon <
Mission at 915 Golden Gate avenue last
night, and the Mormon colony was well
represented. He spoke of matters re
lating to their faith and urged them to be
true to it.
President Smith will probably leave for
his home shortly, as he received a tele
gram yesterday that the investigating
committee in the McCune bribery case
expected to bring in their report to-day.

SPEAKS HARSHLY
OF CANNED BEEF
_-_ ww. rrr _â¢ â  â  V_7._ll _-_ _^
But His Testimony, as Well as
That of Other Witnesses,
Is Contradicted.
WASHINGTON, March There
j were several interesting developments
'â¢ in the beef court of inquiry to-day. It
j was a field day for the volunteer arm
of the service, the waiting room being
filled all day with members of the
various volunteer regiments which
served in Cuba and Porto Rico.
The first of these, Clarence Walters,
of the First Volunteer Engineers, told
a sensational story of hardship and in
humanity suffered during his service,
describing the canned roast beef in
harsher terms than have ever before
been applied to that much discussed
article.
Later In the day, Lieutenant Sewell.
U. S. A., who was major of the volun
teer battalion in which Walters served,
contradicted his story completely, say
ing there was no canned roast beef
aboard the transport which took the
command to Porto Rico. Further than
that, he said Walters had come to him
after landing and asked to be dis
charged, so as to accept a position as
newspaper correspondent, and on being
questioned, said that he had been well
treated while in the service and had
no complaint to make.

An important development was the
denial of the story by one James Far
nan, and also attributed to Dr. Maxwell
Christine of Philadelphia, that they
had seen beef injected with chemicals
in an Omaha packing house. Dr.
Christine explained that what he had
seen was the pickling of corned meats,
the brine being injected into the meat
to save several weeks' time in the pick
ling vat. _, ,
The question of counsel for General
Miles before the court is still in abey
ance, some correspondence having
passed between the general and court,
but both sides decline to give out the
letters until a settlement is reached.
General Miles has not asked to be
represented by counsel, presumably be
cause that would put him in the posi
tion of admitting himself on trial by
the court, which up to date he has de
clined to admit. On the other hand
the court does not feel able, under the
articles of war, to permit Major Lee
or any one else to cross-question wit
nesses unless he can be recognized offi
cially as counsel for the defense. It
was stated that this matter probably
will be settled to-morrow. The court
expects to start West Tuesday or
Wednesday of next week.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March Three more di
rectors of the Union Savings Bank re
signed to-day under the pressure
brought by stockholders. They were
Thomas Rea, H. C. Morrell and E. A.
Wheeler. One vacancy already ex
isted, and L. Calisch, Asa Eaton, J. W.
Rea and Cyrus Jones were elected
members of the directory. These are
men whom the stockholders selected
for places yesterday.
President W. H. Wright and N. Bow
den are the only members of the old
board remaining. C. P. Brestan of San
Francisco is the other rr. ember and was
elected a few d.ays ago.
The directors had agreed to make F.
W. Potter one of the board as a repre
sentative of the depositors; but some
hitch occurred as to whether the stock
holders' power could be transferred to
him under the bank's condition, and
the matter was referred to the Attor
ney General for an opinion. * This will
come up at the meeting to-morrow
afternoon.
Some one will have to resign to make
room for Potter. The four directors
elected to-day declare they will not
make room for the depositors' repre
sentative, and some speculation is be
ing indulged in as to which of the two
old ones will step down and out.

KIPLING ON THE
WAY TO RECOVERY
Condition Continues to
Improve.
COMFORTABLE THOUGH WEAK
SEES NEWSPAPERS AND LIKES
INTEREST SHOWN.
Now There Is Some Concern Over the
Condition of the Patient's Chil
dren, One of Whom Has
Pneumonia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 2.â That Rud- |
yard Kipling'- condition has imnroved j
very greatly during the past twenty- j
four hours Is evidenced by the fact that
but one bulletin was posted during the
day. That was of a very satisfactory
nature, and it was announced to-nis-ht
that no further bulletins would be forth- j
coming until to-morrow afternoon. !
The bulletin issued at the Hotel Gren- i
oble at 3 o'clock this afternoon was:
"Mr. Kipling has made satisfactory !
progress. He has a slight fever, but ;
is comfortable though weak, and reso- j
lution is taking place in the affected
portion of the lungs.
"E. G. JANE WAY.
"THEODORE DUNHAM."
Another indication that the patient
is getting along well is that to-nleht he >
asked to be shown the newspapers and
seemed to be greatly pleased and aa- t
fected at the interest in his illness j
shown by the American people.
Mr. Kipling spent a comfortable
night. He slept for some hours and j
rested well, and again this morning he
enjoyed an hour or two of sleep. In j
this way he has in a great measure
recuperated his strength, and the
promises are very bright for his speedy |
recovery.
According to the latest reports Kip
ling's two little daughters are not seri
ously 111, as was at first thought. The !
elder, Josephine, a child of six, is be- j
ing cared for at the home of Miss |
Deforest, a friend of Mr. Kipling; and >
to-night Miss Deforest said that the I
little one was doing "very nicely, in
deed." This was after Dr. Janeway
had visited the child, with whom he
spent a considerable time. She Is suf
fering from pneumonia, and it is not
known whether she is absolutely out
of danger. The younger of Mr. Kip
ling's daughters, Elsie, a child of three,
was said to-night by Mr. Doubleday
to be suffering from nothing more seri
ous than a severe attack of bronchitis,
and it is hoped that the physicians will
be able to save her from pneumonia.
At 8:30 to-night Mr. Doubleday came
down from the Kipling apartments :
and said that the patient was making ;
rapid improvement. - V V.
"Dr. Janeway will not come back to ;
the hotel to-night," said Mr. Double- |
day. "There is no reason why he i
should. Mr. Kipling is making such
progress that Dr. Janeway's continued
presence is unnecessary."
INVESTIGATION OF THE
SHOOTING OF KISHMOTO
Yolo County Officers Insist That
Japanese Accuse Whites in Or
der to Shield Themselves.
"WOODLAND. March Attorney R. E.
H. Epsey and H. Fumikura, a representa
tive of the Japanese Consul at San Fran- j
Cisco, returned to this city from Blacks j
Wednesday evening, where they went to |
make an investigation of the shooting
of the Jap named Kishmoto. Upon their
return Epsey stated that the matter had
been investigated thoroughly and he is
convinced that the story that two white
men did the shooting is true.
In details the particulars gained by the
recent investigation differ' to some extent
from the account published at the time
of the shooting. According to the later
story it seems that Kishmoto heard a
noise outside the cabin and got out of bed
to investigate. He saw nothing and re
turned. Ho was followed into the cabin
by two white men. who, either because
they thought he would resist or for the
purpose of intimidation, shot him, the j
bullet taking effect in the shoulder. This j
aroused all the Japs and they were hud
dled together and one man covered them
with a pistol while the other searched
their personal effects. This job being
over the two men left the cabin and
quickly disappeared in the darkness.'
This last Investigation was probably in
stituted with a view of making the de- ,
velopments a basis for a claim for dam
ages. The county officers and Mr. How- :
ard still adhere to the theory that the |
shooting was the result of a row among :
the Japs and that the robbery story is a
pure invention to shield one of their num
ber from the consequences of his crime. |
TERRIBLY BURNED BY
A GASOLINE STOVE
LOS ANGELES. March 2.â M. Jones,
a well-known business man of this city,
was horribly burned about the face and
head this morning while in the act of
filling a lighted gasoline stove. That he
was not burned to death and his home de
stroyed by fire was due. to the heroism of
Mrs. Jones and her mother, Mrs. Van
Sickles.
Mrs. Jones was aroused by a piercing
shriek, and, rushing into the kitchen,
found her husband's clothes enveloped In
flames. She secured a blanket and threw
it over him, and Mrs. Van Sickles seized
a pail of water and helped extinguish the
flames. _____
Jones was horribly burned about the
face and neck, and his condition is pre
carious. A strange feature of the accident
is that Jones- is a dealer in oils.
WATER ALIVE WITH SARDINES.
Run of the Shining â  Mites in Mon-
terey Bay.
MONTEREY, March 2.â An extraordi
nary run of sardines has existed in Mon
terey Bay for the past two days, especi
ally in the immediate vicinity of Mon
terey. The shiny mites are here in such
enormous quantities that the water ap
pears literally alive with them in num
bers of spots of several feet in diameter,
and fishermen say they can be dipped up
without difficulty with hand nets, Large
shipments are being made to the various
California markets. This run of sardines
presages a like good riyt of salmon, whose
natural prey the sardines are, and sports
men as well as the professional fishermen
hereabouts are anticipating a fine busi
ness before the close of the week.

JAPAN SEIZES
ARMS SHIPPED
TO AGUINALDO
Serious Blow to the Cause
of the Rebels.
Special cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyright, 1899,
by James Gordon Bennett.
5 MANILA, March 3.â It : is reported here that a steamer +
Â° with 20,000 stands of arms and ammunition, which were Â°
+ bound for the Philippines, has been seized in Japanese waters +
â¦ by the Japanese authorities. +
MANILA, March 2.â Aguinaldo's
army is disheartened as the re
sult of recent actions. Many
companies of the insurgents
have retired from the field
because their officers sulked, and
would not lead. their men.
One hundred Filipinos ran forward
toward the American lines one day re
cently, shouting: "We don't want any
more fight. Viva los Americanos."
The local press comments on Gen
eral rtios' failure to obtain the liberty
of the Spanish prisoners. Aguinaldo
refuses to liberate the priests unless
they give up their landed estates, and
he also imposes the condition that the
Pope shall recognize the full rights of
the native clergy who, because of their
rebellious attitude toward their su
periors are liable to excommunication.
The latest news from Cebu is good.
The natives are returning to the town
and coolies are now willing to work at
reasonable wages. Under the native
government they asked double pay.
Vessels are loading ana business has
been resumed.
Influential natives of the islands of
Malate and Ticao request General Otis
to send troops there. They say that
200 men could easily subdue the rebels.
The inhabitants are peaceable and are
disgusted with the extortions of three
successive native governors.
The two islands contain 80.000 head
of cattle, which constitute the food
supply of the rebel army of the south.
This is the hottest day of , the season,
but fortunately all is quiet inside and
outside the American lines, and the
majority of the men are kept in the
shade.
The United States transport Morgan
City has arrived here. The wives of
the officers and other women passen
gers were not allowed to land, the au
thorities considering the conditions
ashore too unsettled.
The outposts beyond San Pedro Ma
cate were fired upon by the rebels from
the walls of the Guadalupe church.
A gunboat advanced 300 yards beyond
the lines and cleared away the enemy
with Catlings. No casualties are re
ported. ,
General Miller has . been ordered to
quarter his troops in lloilo in the cus
tom house or other public buildings
and authorized to make the necessary
changes at a cost not to exceed $40,000.

revenues collected in lloilo.

WHY GERMANS ARE LEFT
TO AMERICAN PROTECTION
BERLIN, March 2.â A high German
authority, who prefers to be nameless,
assures the correspondent here of the
Associated Press that the motives
which induced Germany to intrust the
protection of Germans in the Philip
pine Islands are simple. The Kaiserin
Augusta and other German warships in
the Far East are needed in Chinese
waters, owing to the recent disturb
ances, and Germany feels that German
Interests are safe under, the protection
of Americans. This implies, of course,
a high compliment to the United States,
but it is only in consonance with sev
eral previous declarations made by
Baron yon Bulow, the German Minister
of Foreign Affairs.
Regarding Samoa, the same high Ger
man authority said Germany was
awaiting the initiative of the other
powers. If the division of the islands
is to be carried out the officials of the
German Navy Department say the Ger
man third-class cruiser Falke will be
relieved by the German fourth-class
cruiser Sperber. The new German gun
boat Yagur is going to China, making
a total of twenty-five German war
ships on foreign service.
ADDITIONAL REGULARS
ORDERED TO MANILA
WASHINGTON, March The Sec
retary of War has just ordered the re
inforcement of General Otis by six reg
iments. These are the Sixth Infantry,
now at San Antonio; the Sixth Artil
lery, scattered along the Atlantic Coast
stations; the Ninth Infantry, at Madi
son Barracks; Thirteenth Infantry, in
New York State; Twenty-first Infantry,
at Plattsburg, N. V., and the Sixteenth
Infantry, at Fort Crook and neighbor
ing posts in the Middle .West. These

regiments have been ordered to make

thence to Manila.
In answer to the direct question as to |
whether or not the regular troops are I
intended to relieve a corresponding I
number of volunteer soldiers at Ma- I
nila it was paid at the "War Department j
that while this probably would be the j
case it was not possible yet to make a -
positive statement. This means that if
when the reinforcements arrive at Ma
nila the conditions are satisfactory the
volunteers will be brought home, but
if Otis shall have need for all of the
combined force then they must wait.
The reinforcements are made up of
troops who are not only regulars in the
full sense of the term, but who have i
been through the Cuban or Porto Rican
campaigns. They know what it is to
be under fire; how to hunt Indians and
also how to fight in tropical jungles. I
With them replacing the same number
of volunteers General Otis will have a j
majority of regulars in his command,
something the War Department has
earnestly desired to bring about at the
earliest possible moment. The posi
tion of the American commander at '
Manila also will be safeguarded against
the effect of a sudden and forced dis
charge of volunteers by the ratification
of the peace treaty.
DEWEY WANTS THE
SMALLER GUNBOATS
WASHINGTON, March 2.â Admiral
Dewey is again pressing on the Navy
Department the urgent need of vessels
of light draft as a means of communi
cation between the small islands of the
Philippine group. , To this end the gun
boat Vixen, which figured bravely for
j a vessel of her light caliber at the out
| set of the Cuban campaign, has been
; ordered to be immediately fitted out at
I the Norfolk navy yard for sailing for
Manila. This will take about a month,
i and it probably will be three or four
| months before she joins Dewey's fleet-
I Besides the Concord, which is perhaps
I too large to be classified as one of the
I small craft, the only light vessel now in
! the Philippines available for running
I about in those waters are the Petrel
\ and the Helena. The Castine and the
Princeton are now speeding in that di
rection, but the small craft equipment
I there will still be inadequate. The de
j partment is anxious to afford Admiral
; Dewey all the assistance possible. He
; has repeatedly called attention to the
great importance of this work and has
I emphasized the fact that it is light ves
sels, fit to skirmish about in the shal
low waters and to run in and out of
I harbors where the larger ones would
be useless, that he wants rather than
i the heavier types. ;'.i

TOWNSEND MAY BE
MINISTER TO SPAIN
NEW YORK, March 2.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald tel
egraphs: Believing Spain will soon rat
ify the peace treaty, President McKin
ley is considering the appointment of a
Minister to Spain. Information ob
tained to-day indicates that the ap
pointment will probably be given to
Lawrence Townsend, now Minister to
Portugal. He has had considerable dip

several hundred American soldiers
prisoners and removed them to the in
terior. As a matter of fact, General
Otis' bulletins have accounted for
every man in the American army at
Manila, and there is not on record a
single case missing. Secretary Alger
has brought the report to the attention
of General Otis with a view to securing
the most specific denial.
INSANE PATIENTS
TO WORK A FARM
Innovation at Stockton for Which the
Legislature May Grant an
Appropriation.
STOCKTON, March What kind of
farmers will the patients of an insane
asylum make? That is the question which
arises with the announcement that a
truck farm is to be operated in connec
tion with the big asylum at this place.
The board of managers has reason to ex
pect favorable action this week by the
Legislature on its request for an appro
priation with which to purchase land to
undertake this novel venture. It will be
an innovation which will be closely
watched by other institutions of the kind
throughout the land and by those who
wish to see State institutions put as near
1 as possible upon a self-sustaining oasis.
The tract of land it is proposed to pur
i chase is on. the San Joaquin River, five
; miles from the asylum. It is ferine and
we'll adapted in every way for truck farm
â¢ ing. There are about 100 acres in the
i farm. It was impossible to procure land
: adjoining the asylum property, as it is
'â  all within the city limits, and town lots |
, would be rather expensive even for a ricn
State to experiment upon.
The working force to the number of ,
about 100 a day is to be conveyed to the
I farm every morning and returned in good
! season to the asylum, and eventually,
' when the North-street canal is opened to
I the river, the farm may be reached by the
I water route, as the canal runs along the
\ northern boundary of the asylum grounds
There are about 300 men of young and
medium age, physical strength and light ;
mental maladies who will be available for
the work, Experience around the grounds
â  has demonstrated that considerable work
can be got out of the patients as in
nearly every instance they are daft on
' Snly one or two subjects. They are
i whimsical about their work, hut what the
'â  overseer lacks in quality he will have in
quantity. Many of the patients are pos-
I sessed of a distinct aversion to work and
i of enough cunning to refuse to labor on
the ground that they are Patients and.
I cannot be forced to do so. There is said
to be some legal merit in this contention
but diplomacy is all-effective in dealing
\ with this class of unfortunates Y\ her i a
i strike seemed to be imminent the induce
ment of extra tobacco was held out as an
l incentive for industry among those af
flicted with laziness. Tobacco generally
; had the desired effect, and the 'kickers
: would resume their spasmodic efforts at
The" idea of taking 100 crazy men through
the city and working them in the open is
not relished by those who reside near the
farm, or even in this city; but the board
of managers will probably surround them
j with such safeguards as to obviate any
excuse for a public protest. The under
taking is at best an experiment, and no
one except a few of the asylum directors
seems anticipate that the farm will
reduce the asylum expenses to any notice
able degree. The only benefit will be in
supplying work for patients. The physi
cians, as a result of experience and ob
! servation, have found that work has been
beneficial in many cases that have come
tinder their care. But the experiment
from a financial point of view, is at least
I worth watching.
THE PLANET JUPITER'S
ERRATIC MOVEMENTS
Professor George W. Hough Thinks
He Has Made an Important
Discovery.
CHICAGO, March 2.â Professor George
W Hough, the astronomer at the Dear
born Observatory in Evanston, has made
public a new discovery in regard to the
surface rotations of the planet Jupiter,
which is completely at variance with the
existing belief. It is the general tenet of
astronomers, and the statements are em
bodied In the most recent textbooks on
the science, that the surface rotation of
the planet Jupiter is similar to that of
the sun, being quickest near the equator
and slowest in the high latitudes near the
P ln his conclusions, based on a long rec
ord of observations extending over
twenty years, and which he has just com
pleted, Professor Hough announces his
belief that the surface of the planet Ju
piter rotates upon its axis in separate en
velopes or strata.
Professor Hough further discovered In
the long series of observations that the
spots shift- in longitude, besides having
a rotary movement, and this also sup
ports the ring or strata theory, strength
ening Professor Hough's belief of many
years that Jupiter is in a gaseous or plas
tic state. -

INDIANS DESTITUTE

LOS ANGELES, March. 2.â A.
Wright, chief Indian Agent for the South

"Something must be done, that is all,"
declares Mr. Wright. "The Indians have
never had such a year before. They
need clothes and food, and many are sick,
some having consumption. Once they had
the best in the land. Now they have the
worst. They are driven to the rocks and
mountains. They have hitherto con
trived to live on beans and acorns, but
civilization has encroached upon them
and unless it rains very soon their little
garden truck will amount to nothifig, and
they cannot find work. There has not
been a case of smallpox among the In
dians of Southern California."

LEO DID NOT
CONDEMN REAL
AMERICANISM
View Taken in Rome of the
Letter to Cardinal
Gibbons.
DUST CLEARED AWAY
Archbishop Ireland Rightly Inter
preted the Views of the
Sovereign Pontiff.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROME, March 2.-â The im
pression prevails here, now that
the dust has settled and things
can be plainly seen, that the
Pope's letter to Cardinal Gibbons
approves real "Americanism"
and condemns those who had
misrepresented it. The Pope col
lected, examined and definitely
repudiated all such misrepresen
tations.
Incidentally he believes that
the things so alleged never ex
isted in America, for the Ameri
can Bishops would have de
nounced them, and his Holiness
thus vindicates true "American
ism."
Archbishop Ireland's letter ap
pears to have emphasized the
Pope's views, and it is generally
understood that Cardinal Ram
polla, Papal Secretary of. State,
has assured him that the Pope
never condemned and never in
tended to condemn real "Ameri
canism," declaring also that
Archbishop Ireland had rightly
interpreted the views of the Pope,
and urged him to make this fact
known.

BLOWN TO PIECES
AND YET LIVES
Mangled Body of an Oregon
Farmer Found in the Ruins
of His Dwelling-
O PORTLAND, Or., March Silas Brady, who lives on a farm near O
Â© here, was fearfully mangled to-day in a dynamite explosion which re- Â©
Â© duced his dwelling to ruins. About. 9 o'clock this morning a neighbor Â©
Â© of Brady's heard a terrible explosion at the Brady 'residence, and on O
O going over to see what was the matter found the building in ruins and O
Â© Brady lying senseless among the debris. J*
Â© Brady has been blasting out stumps with dynamite, and had cvi- O
Â© dently been preparing cartridges for use, when in some way they were O
O exploded. His left arm was blown off and no part of it could be O
Â© found. His face and breast were filled with particles of dynamite and O
Â© both his eyes very badly injured. Four holes were blown in the walls O
O of the abdomen, two of them clear through. A hole was blown O
O through one foot and fragments of a stove were found driven into Â©
Â© various parts of his body. **
O Dr. A. L. Saylor was summoned, and on his arrival it was decided O
O to bring Brady to this city on the train, and he was taken to the Good Â©
O 'Samaritan Hospital, where the stump of his left arm was amputated O
O and his other injuries attended to. Â©
O He was able to talk a little this evening, but could not give any Â©
O connected statement as to the cause of the accident. His chances for O
O recovery are very slim. Â®
O It is supposed that he was adjusting fuses to cartridges of dyna- O
Â© mite, preparatory to taking them out to put under a stump, when in O
Â© some way they were exploded. As the left hand was blown clean O
Â© away It Is probable he was holding the cartridges in that hand while O

Aeronauts.

DR. TERWAYNE CONTEMPLATES
A NEW VENTURE.
With His Associates He Will At

City at the Paris Ex
position.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, March 2.â Among
the recent arrivals in this city from
Dawson are three of more than ordi
nary interest. They are Count E. de
Rouloux, M. P. E. de Vick and Dr.
Terwayne, a party, of noted Parisian
aeronauts and scientists, who went
north about a year ago, having an
idea of attempting an aerial voyage
into the polar regions in search of An
dree. They left the balloon in Van
couver (it was afterwards sold to the
United States for war purposes and
was used during the unpleasantness
with Spain), and went north to famil
iarize themselves with the conditions
existing in the Yukon Valley.
To The Call correspondent Dr. Ter
wayne explained that he very soon
abandoned the idea he had formulated,
first because of the difficulty of obtain
ing the necessary chemicals for the
manufacture of the inflating gas, and
principally because the climatic con
ditions were distinctly unfavorable for
aerial navigation. An ascent would be
impossible at Skaguay because of the
prevalence of contrary winds, and in
the passes it would be too dangerous
for similar reasons. Further north th?
entire absence of wind prevented any
possibility of success, and so the doctor
was compelled to reluctantly abandon
his cherished enterprise.
Arriving at Skaguay on his return
journey Dr. Terwayne received the-in
telligence of Andree's remains having
been found, and he congratulated him
self and companions upon the fact
that they had not braved the same
fate upon what would have proved a
hopeless quest.
Dr. Terwayne is nothing if not orig
inal. He has conceived a scheme dar
ing in its originality and magnificent
in its possibilities. It is nothing more
nor less than an imitation of the Klon
dike in Paris, and the doctor is has
tening as fast as steam can take him
to the French metropolis to arrange, if
possible, for the necessary space
either in the exposition grounds or ad
jacent thereto.
Interested in the scheme are some of
the millionaires of Dawson, and money
is the least momentous consideration
to the enthusiastic and vivacious
Frenchman. The plan is to construct a
replica of Dawson's main streetâ log
cabins, dance halls and allâ people it
with genuine Klondikers. and also to
show an actual representation of the
mining operations as carried on along
the creeks. There would be so much
realism about It that gold dust would
be scattered about and be washed up
In orthodox fashion, and as far as pos
sible the scenery of the Klondike cap
ital would be duplicated.
"Of course," said Dr. Terwayne. "it
Is uncertain. It is possible though,
and if I can get the ground I shall
show the Parisians what Dawson Is
like." i --M
"You can tell the readers of The
Call," continued the doctor, "that there
will be an epidemic in Dawson this year;
they care for nothing but money, and
all the filth is allowed to remain on the
streets is horrible. And I can also
tell you that men in Dawson are not
earning the money they were. Many
will work for little more than a living,
but there is little work doing, and I was
paying the highest wages to my party
of any employer, 85 cents per hour. The
royalty is made the excuse for suspend
ing work on many claims, the men
thinking it will be taken off.
"I can give you some news that will
Interest Californians," said the doctor.
"The Berry Brothers, who hail from
there,. were in danger of losing their
rich claims on El Dorado. The claims
are very valuable and they were taking
out over $150,000 a season. The lease
lapsed some time ago and by a mis
take in the date they failed to renew it
until one day after the. time allowed..
In the meantime an intimate friend
who knew the workings of the claim
stepped in and jumped it. The brothers
protested, but the Dawson courts held
that the jumping was quite legal and
the owners had to pay $40,000 to get
their property back. 'â [:;.

' CHICAGO, March 2.â John J. Mitch
ell, president of the Illinois Trust and
Savings Bank, upon receiving word
from New York that a majority of the
stock of the Chicago and Alton had
been deposited with the United States
Trust Company, and that pledges had
been given for the deposit of many
more shares, gave out to-day the mem
bers of the purchasing syndicate. They
are George Gould, president of the
Missouri Pacific; Jacob Schiff. chair
man of the board of ' the Baltimore'

of the National City Bank of New
York, representing the Rockefeller
holdings in the Missouri, Kansas and
Texas, and E. H. Harriman. chairman
of the board of the Union Pacific, rep
resenting the Vanderbilt interests.
Harriman is also understood to rep
resent to some extent the Illinois Cen
tral road, which is indirectly interested
in the deal. Beyond the expenditure
of $3,000,000 for the improvement of the
property generally, and another $2,000,
--000 which is to be set aside for the work
of elevating the tracks of the company
at Chicago, it is understood that the
syndicate has not yet made any defi
nite plans for the future management
of the road. Mr. Blackstone will prob
ably retire from the presidency, and
Vice President and General Manager
Chappell may succeed him. Mr. Black
stone was offered the chairmanship of
the executive committee, but declined
It. The other officials of the company
will, it is understood, retain their pres
ent positions. v." .
Chief among the men who owned and
have sold the road were Marshall Field,
A. C. Bartlett, A. A. Sprague and John
J. Mitchell.
The price paid, counting in the bond
ed debt, is $74,505,676.
With the tidings of the consumma
tion of the deal came the report that
the new owners of the Alton would sell
its share in the Union Depot Company,
owning the Union Depot terminals at
Adams street, and would become les
sees of the Chicago Railway Terminal
Company, with its passenger station at
Harrison street and Fifth avenue.
The purchaser of the Alton's share
in the Union depot, according to the
report, will be the Pennsylvania. The
latter road wants this terminal for its
Panhandle line. . ,7V ;;;:.. 1
The sale of the Alton will, it is said,
have a far-reaching effect on the rail
road business of the entire country.

TOBERMORY, Scotland, March 2.â
The Dominion line steamship Labrador,
from St. John, N. 8., for Liverpool, ran
ashore about four miles from Skerry
vore on Wednesday morning. Captain
Erskine, her commander, has sent the
following dispatch to the agents of the
steamship at Liverpool:
"Labrador ran on Mackenzie Rock in
a thick fog at 7 o'clock yesterday morn
ing, four miles from Skerryvore. The
ship was caught amidships, the seas
breaking over. Holds Nos. 1, 2 and 3
were soon full of water. The passen
gers and crew were saved in the boats.
One boatload was landed at Skerry
| lighthouse. The German steamship
| Viking picked up the remainder. No
I steamship is obtainable to return for
! the passengers. If the ship is not broken
up will endeavor to save the mails
when a steamship Is obtained."
The Labrador had a good passage un
til Sunday, when she entered a fog
bank and lost her bearings.' Skerry
vore light was mistaken for Inistrahull
light, on the north of Ireland. Most of
the passengers were still in bed when
the steamship struck and there was
much excitement, but the passengers
were calmed by the assurances of the
captain, the boats were lowered with
i out a hitch and all on board left the
steamship in safety. _â ;''. >-'_
The passengers and crew lost every
thing they possessed. The women and
children were put in the first boat and
the other passengers in the. second
boat. The crew of the Labrador took
the other boats. > â¢â¢â -;â  -.
After three and a half hours the boats
met the steamship Viking from Nor
way, which took them on board.
W hen the Labrador was last seen she
was settling down by the stern. The
passengers of the wrecked steamship
are full of praise for the Labrador's
officers and crew and for the conduct
of the captain of the Viking.
Agoncillo, the Filipino representative,
who ran away from the United States
on the outbreak of hostilities at Ma
nila, was a passenger on the Labrador,
and behaved like an arrant coward
when the vessel struck.
OBAN, March 2.â half dozen of the
rescued passengers of the Labrador
have arrived here. All speak of the
suddenness and completeness of the
disaster. One lady was obliged to leave
jewelry worth $3000 behind her, and an
other "passenger, a man, left $1500 in
cash.
The lighthouse steamer left Oban this
afternoon to try to take off the passen
. gers imprisoned in . the - Skerryvore
lighthouse and to salvage the mails.

HEART WEAKNESS. â¢;
Is your heart weak? Do you have the

LEGISLATION FOR
NICARAGUA CANAL
Senate and House Conferees
Struggling With River and
Harbor Bill.
WASHINGTON. March 2.â The river and harbor bill conferees ad
journed shortly after 10 o'clock to-night until tomorrow morning at 10,
having been unable to agree. Chairman Frye of the Senate conferees said:
"We have been unable to agree, so that is all there Is to say."
He was asked, "Is there any prospect of agreement?"
"I can't say," he replied. "it looks very dubious."
The conferees discussed the different propositions and counter proposi
tions which have been made regarding the Nicaragua canal bill, but upon
adjournment to-night the House conferees as a whole refuse to allow any
declaration for a Nicaragua canal in the bill although Burton is willing
to have a; declaration of policy and liberal appropriation for a commis
sion to select the best rout The Senate conferees offered a proposition
looking to an investigation of the best route, leaving the selection to a
mission, but insisting that provision should be made for beginning
work. Between the confer. there is still a wide difference and no mem
ber of the conference will predict an adjustment to-morrow.
Some of the big questions in the bill have been settled; The Senate pro
visions for the harbors at New York. Philadelphia and Baltimore will be
retained. There is a sharp fight over the reservoirs at the waters of
the Missouri River, the indications being that the Senate will yield. It was
also asserted that the House conferees refused to accept the Senate amend
ments for Improvements in Oregon, known as the Yaqulna Bay and Colum
bia River boat railway projects, and that they would have to be compro
mised.
The conference committee or. the river and harbor bill has agreed to the
appropriation for Aiviso harbor. This is gratifying to Congressman Loud,
who has been earnestly working to secure this item.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, March 2.â A j
climax has been reached In the affairs ,
cf Santiago. The estimates for Febru- ;
ary have been reduced from $70,000 to j
$''0,000 and amounts aggregating $50,000 i
expended last month have been disal- !
lowed by the authorities at Havana. j
General Leonard Wood. Military Gov- J
ernor. says it Is impossible to estimate!
exactly a month ahead, and thinks the ;
best plan would be to forward a cer- , j
tain percentage to Havana every j
month, the department commander J
having the privilege of using the bal- j
ance. subject to objection later, as un
der the present system it ls Impossible j
to run the government here. For the I
month of March all expenditures for j
the entire province must be kept within i
$10,000.
Even those Cubans who are most
friendly to the United States authori
ties pay this amount is less than was
allowed at any time under the Spanish ;
regime. In the opinion of others the
object of th- restriction is to discredit
the work already done here by throw
ing out of employment a large number
Of men and creating discontent and dis- ;
turbance. This is, of course, an alto- ;
gather erroneous assumption, but the
fact is that to-morrow more than TOO j
men will be out of work, a circumstance
generally recognized as a dangerous |
menace to nubile safety at just this |
Juncture and involving a large ad- j
ditional police force. me merchants ;
say it will necessitate the presence of
additional regiments, even if an msur- ,
rectlon does not finally result.
It is significant that the Cuban ex- j
tremists, who talk openly against
American rule, go about explaining !
how 5000 of their men properly^ armed j
could now gain possession of the pro
vince of Santiago in two days if the.
plan were properly arranged before

sort of bluster are mere nobodies, but
the fact that anybody will listen to j
them indicates the general discontent
born of these vexatious instructions
from Havana.
Even the Americans here cannot com
prehend what Havana hopes to achieve '
by bringing about a practical cessation j
of all public works in the largest pro

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. March 2.â The Sen
ate in executive session to-day took up
the Sampson and Schley promotions
and discussed them briefly. Senator
Butler moved to consider the nomina
tion of Admiral Schley, Independ
ently of the nominations. but
it being apparent that no Quor
um was present, the Senate went
into open session. The motion remains
pending and will be pressed by Senator
Butler at the next executive session.
The greater part of the session to-day
was devoted to unobjected nomina
tions.
In open session, pending considera
tion of the fortification bill, the follow
ing measures were passed: Authoriz
ing the Commissioner of the Freed
men's Trust and Savings Company to
pay 62 per cent dividends to depositors:
a House bill to encourage the holding
of a pan-American exposition on the
Niagara frontier at Buffalo. N. V.. in
1901.
The Senate then proceeded with the
fortifications bill, the bill being in pre
cisely the same form as it passed the
House. It carries $4,744,79-.
Pettigrew proposed an amendment
striking out an appropriation of $65,000
for the purchase of a Gathmann gun
and one of $10,000 for the ammunition.
The amendment was defeated.
The Senate, on motion of Hoar, at
6 o'clock, went into executive session.
At the conclusion of the executive ses
sion, the Senate resumed legislative
business at 6:15 p. m.
After remarks by Foraker on the
death of Representative Stephen A.
Northway of Ohio, the usual resolu
tions of regret were adopted, and the
Senate took a recess until 8:15 p. m.
When the Senate reconvened Quay

amendment of the House to the meas

building for the Department of Justice,
the amendment limiting the cost to
$1,000,000. The motion was agreed to,
which passed the bill.
An effort was made by Senator Fair
banks to obtain consideration of the
bill to extend the anti-contract labor
laws of the United States to Hawaii,
but Morgan, one of the Hawaiian com
missioners, objected and the measure
went over. 'â¢.,
Consideration of the fortifications bill
; was resumed and Tillman was recog
-1 nized, to reply to speeches made earlier
In the day by Gorman and Lodge. He
said that it was an anomalous condition
, that the conference on the naval bill
was in control of men who were op
\ posed to the Senate amendment to re
duce the price of armor plate. He was
; willing and anxious to give the admin
; istration all the support it needed, both
for the army and the navy.
Later Piatt of Connecticut Inquired
I If Tillman believed the Krupp armor
. could be procured at even $445 per ton.
Tillman replied that perhaps it could
â  not be, but he was convinced that the
extra price for Krupp armor was "sim
| ply a scheme to rob us out of $145 a
ton. ' He was willing to complete every
battleship now on the stocks and pay
$400 a ton for the armor, but he wanted
Congress to proceed to the erection of
an armor factory and thus free the
i country from the clutches of the armor
â  trust.
Piatt of Connecticut said he desired
' simply that the war vessels of the
United States should be covered with
the very best armor made, and he
thought all other Americans felt as he
did. He did not believe that England,
Russia and Germany were submitting
to the exactions of an unconscionable
j trust and it was in evidence that they
j were paying about $575 a ton for the
J Krupp armor.
: Chandler of New Hampshire declared
j In answer Â«to questions that there was
j no evidence that the Krupp armor was
! any better than the Harveyized armor,
j as no Investigation had been made of
armor since Secretary Herbert made
his Investigation. N
The fortifications bill was then passed
without division. The bill was passed
precisely as it came from the House,
without amendment, and goes to the
President.
The conference reports on the census
and naval personnel bills were agreed
to and these measures also go to the
President.
WILL NOT RACE IN THE EAST
Burns & Waterhouse Weary of Play
ing a Losing Game.
NEW YORK, March 2.â A private letter
from San Francisco to a racing official
here says Burns & Waterhouse will prob
ably not race in this part of the country
this year. The letter goes on to say the
firm wants to race in New York. but its
members realize they must have "sure
enough" race horses to get money here,
and they are shy on that commodity.
They have nothing really high cla-*s on
which to depend, their best one being on
the ailing or stale list now.
Previous attempts to campaign here
have been expensive, and they nave grown
tired of the outpouring of dollars with but
small chance of getting any of It back.
Burns & Waterhouse are not entering in
any of the Eastern stakes now closing.
SWING OUT
THE JAPANESE
SLAVE TRAFFIC
The Trial of Toda, the
Procurer.
BOTHER WITH INTERPRETERS
|
SOME REMARKABLE ANTICS OF j
THE DEFENSE.
|
I
A Despicable Business That Is Car- I
ried on Openly Under the Eyes
of the Federal Port
Officials.
Toda, the Japanese charged with keep- :
i ing a minor girl in a house of ill repute, i
: gave his testimony in Judge Groezinger's '
i court yesterday afternoon. As a statement
maker Toda is peculiar. He began by in- i
: slstlng in excellent English that he could j
; not speak that tongue and demanded an
: interpreter. The court had been taxed to ;
I the limit of its patience by Japanese in- |
terpreters, and the demand was not re- ,
[ ceived with good grace.
Toda a few months ago was the prose
cuting witness in a suit against two of
his countrymen, and his knowledge of the
English tongue was at that time clear
enough to win bis case, but after some
skirmishing among the large audience of
Japs an interpreter was caught and
sworn. Then Toda started in to ruin the
cause of the State. The girl Chiyo had
stated on the stand that Toda had given
her about $10 and her mother or some
relative the same sum in Japan when he
engaged her to come to this country for
employment in his. handkerchief store,
and that when she arrived In San Fran
cisco, an ignorant immigrant girl, 16 years
old. she learned for the first time her
hideous fate. In the hands of the ruthless
slave dealer. Toda. she was helpless, and
when she failed to earn a reasonable
amount of money he beat her. To make
her condition more pitiable, she ' was
forced to entertain his Chinese friends
and to hand her owner every cent given
her. __****-_ "Â«â¢â¢
The Japanese slave dealers In this city
charge their chattels $300 for bringing
them over from Japan, and under the pre
tense of letting the girls work themselves
out of debt allow them a small percent
age of their earnings. But they manage
to keep that $300 standing against their
bondswomen by inflicting fines whenever
it suits their fancy. : â - : â .-.â â 'â¢
Toda swore that he never saw the girl
in Japan and never offered her employ
ment in a store anywhere. He also swore
that the place at 3 Brooklyn place
did not belong to him. and that he was
only the cook there. He couid not read
his'own name. _"ââ¢_,
The rent and grocery bills of .-, Brooklyn
place are all mad" out In his name, yet he
denied the ownership. He also denied
that the woman with whom he lives and
who is evidently the mistress of his es
tablishment is his wife, though he has
called her such since his arrest.
Attorney Donavon, for the defense, ap
peared to be trying to get the case over
into Japan. He claimed if the girl Chiyo
was inveigled into a San Francisco house
the inveigling was done in Japan, and the
State of California was usurping a func
tion of the Mikado in prosecuting Toda.
Court Interpreter <*-effeney. though not
on duty, was present as a sort of assist
ant for the defense, consulting in whis
pers with Donavon. His action drew
forth a strong protest from Attorney
Reardon of the prosecution.
At the close of Toda's testimony the
trial was continued until next-Monday af
ternoon. _ , _.'â¢'"â â .-- 'â â --_ i_
It 'iÂ« the Intention of the Society for the
Suppression of Vice to stamp out if pos
sible the importation of Japanese girls
for immoral purposes. There are eight
or ten notorious slave owners in Brooklyn
place who are engaged in the traffic un
der the eves of the Federal port officials,
the chief of whom is said to be I. _ama-
The recent exposure of this disreputa
ble business in The Call has caused Jap
anese Consul General Mutsu to place his
office In communication with Secretary
Kane of the society. The Consul tenders

A BLOODTHIRSTY BAKER.
Carlo Ferro Arrested for Threatening
to Wipe Out a Whole Family.
Carlo Ferro, a baker, is of a blood
thirsty nature and threatened to wipe out ,
a whole family within twenty-four hours.
Ho appeared before Judge Graham yester
day to answer a charge of threats against
life
The complaining witness was Mrs. Lucy
Gulnasso' 11 Barman place. She testified t
that last Tuesday Ferro called at her
he.use and threatened to kill her and her
children within twenty-four hours unless
she paid him $300 which he alleged her late
husband had owed him. She was afraid
that be would carry out his threat.
Ferro claims that there is $300 owing j
him from the Gulnasso estate, of which j
the widow is administratrix. The time i
expired for all accounts to be sent in j
against the estate unknown to him. and i
when he demanded the money from Mrs.
Gulnasso she refused to give it to him. !

How the Crew of the
Phelps Fared.
OVERDUE SCHOONER'S LUCK
BARK TEMUCO TO DISCHARGE
AND REPAIR HERE.
The Dauntless Breaks Down at Her
Wharfâ Arrival of the Overdue
M. P. â The Cey
lon's Damages.
The long overdue schooner W. S. Phelps
finally made port yesterday. Kor nearly
two- months the crew has been fighting
head winds and calms, and when th? ves
sel's anchor was dropped off Meiggs
wharf every man on board heaved a sigh
of relief. For six weeks not one of them
had washed his face, and until the
schooner put into Santa Cruz they had
been smoking hops for tobacco and mak
ing coffee out of ground split peas. Kor
eight days they had been without meat,
and their drinking water was foul. The
decks leaked .and in the forecastle the
crew bad to sleep in wet bedclothes and
walk through puddles of water until near
ly a.. o: them have rheumatism.
"We left San' Pedro for Eureka fifty
one days ago,' said the mate yesterday.
"I have been through some tough times
on the Atlantic and in the Arctic, but
such a voyage as the one we had on the
Phelps I never heard the equal of. The
vessel had been lying a long time in San
Pedro before she was sold by the Mar
shal, and during that time she got very
dirty. She had, previously to her arrival
in San Pedro, lost her centerboard, so
you see she was not In the best of trim
for a voyage. Then our water was no
good, but that fact I did not discover
until we were out it sea. It was so of
fensive we could hardly drink it. We
landed at one of the islands in the Santa
Barbara Channel and got some fresh
water, or I do not know what we would
have done.
"Well, if you are anything of a sailor
you can imagine .what kind of progress
we made without a centerboard and bar
nacles two feet thick on her bottom. We
were three weeks In rounding Point Sur,
and then we made fair progress. Fre
quently, however, we would make a run
of twenty-four miles during the day ami
drift back twice the distance during the
night.
â¢'On Sunday. February 19, we were off
Santa Cruz, and the captain determined
to run in for supplies. At that time we
were back to the foul water, our coffee
had given out and we were using a con
coction made from split peas. We had no
canned meats, sugar or tea. and, worst
of all. no tobacco, so we had to smoke
hops as a makeshift.
"We sailed from Santa Cruz as soon as
we got some supplies, and on Tuesday.
February 21. we got past Pigeon Point
and were standing inshore with a west
erly wind, as Captain Alexander of the
Santa Rosa reported us. That night,
however, the wind took a change and the
next morning we had been driven back
forty-two miles south of Pigeon Point.
That was the kind of experience we had
right along, and our twelve days' run
from Santa Cruz to San Francisco was
one that I hope never to duplicate."
The Phelps will go on the dry dock here
and will have a new centerboard put
in and her decks recalked. after which
she will proceed to Eureka to load lumber
for San Pedro.
The Chilean bark Temuco. which put In
here in distress last Wednesday night,
will probably discharge her cargo and go
on the drydock for repairs. She was
bound for Victoria, B. Â«'.. but was caught
in a gale on February 25 and lost her
jlbboom, fore topgallant mast, fore top
mast, main royal mast and main top
gallant mast. Besides this, she was very
much strained and will require a thor
ough overhauling.
The Temuco was formerly the American
bark Independence and was built at Bos
ton in 1871. Several years ago she was
.old by C. P. Hemanway of Boston to
M. B. Peede of Valparaiso, and was put
under the Chilean flag. She is 165.6 feet
long, 34 feet 2 inches broad and 22 feet
7 Inches deep. She has been in the ni
trate trad-' ever since her purchase by
Mr. Peede.
The Union Transportation Company of
Stockton is having a run of hard luck.
Its last steamer broke down yesterday
morning, and until repairs can be made
the company's freight and passengers
will have to be carried on the opposition
steamers. Last Tuesday night the Cap
tain Weber broke her shaft when be
tween the Brothers and Pinole Point.
Her passengers were taken to Stockton
on the opposition steamer Mary Garratt
and next day the Dauntless towed her
to San Francisco. Yesterday the Daunt
less arrived from Stockton, and when
docking at Clay street wharf her shaft
broke, so both steamers are helpless. It
will take about a month to repair the
vessels, and in the meantime the steam
ers of the California Navigation and Im
provement Company will carry all the
freight and passengers. â¢
The surveyors went over the bark Cey
lon yesterday and Inspected the damage
she received while in collision with the
British ship Talus. The captain of the
Ceylon asserts that the Talus drifted

TWO UNFORTUNATE VESSELS.
The Schooner W. S. Phelps and the Chilean Bark
Temuco.
The Phelps was fifty-one days coming here from San Pedro and the Temuco was partially dismasted
on February 25. The crew of the schooner had a terrible time getting here, and the bark will have to dis
charge her cargo and go on the ways for an overhauling. She was bound from Iquique for Victoria, B. C.
and put in here in distress. .

v THE GOLDEN POPPY.
CALIFORNIA may rejoice. The poppy, gleam
ing yellow on a thousand hillsâ perhaps on even
more, to say nothing of the peaceful valleys
betweenâ has been vindicated. No executive veto
was sufficient to dim its splendor, nor did its
gorgeous petals shrivel under the blast of official dis
approval. The Assembly says that the poppy shall
be the State flower.
If there was one thing California particularly needed
it was a State flower. At times there has been a
yearning for rain, for a rise in the price of prunes, for
a loftier statesmanship, amendments of the code, a
giant exposition, an end to Burns. However, there
has been on all these subjects a lack of unanimity.
Much as there might be to commend them, their ad
vocacy has been certain to provoke opposition. Not
sc with the elevation of the poppy. With one ac
cord the public heart swelled big at the' thought and
the public voice, clamoring for fruition of the plan,
was is the roar of many seas.
Strangely enough, Governor Gage did not perceive
the purport of the tumult. He may have mistaken
it for the sound of wind escaping from a Senatorial
boom. Thus this act, so benign, so fraught with des
tiny, the finished product of cultivated minds, ran
against a veto. It was not to be crushed. It gath
ered itself up, took a run and jump and sailed to vic
tory so high that it can turn back and say to the veto,
"Never touched me."
Scotland has its thistle, England its rose, Ireland its
shamrock, and now California springs from obscur
ity and, wreathed in bloom as yellow as a Hearst
daily, joins the procession. We congratulate every
body, the commonwealth which now realizes that its
Legislature did not meet in vain, and the poppy it

when Dan Burns was a candidate for the Senate.
NOW IS THE TIME TO STOND.
THE sixty day limit of the Legislature has ex
pired. From that expiration to the end of the
session the members serve without per diem.
In the situation which early developed in the Burns'
campaign it is evident that his hopes for success were
projected to this very time. Personal reasons indis
pose many members to longer desert pressing private
business, and they desire to get excused to go home.
Under ordinary circumstances many such leaves of
absence might be sought and granted without harm.
But now the case is^ifferent. The future of the party
j appeals to the patient loyalty of Republicans and the
| welfare of the State is a consideration affecting Demo
j crats. Every day's experience, since the Senatorial
I fight began has made it clearer that the vast majority
of the people of the State are opposed to making
Burns Senator. His fight has lost popular strength
from the beginning. Those who were disposed to
tolerate it as one of the inevitable incidents of politics
have come to regard it with active aversion. Indif
ference has been turned into a keenly sensitive feeling
that the State cannot afford to turn away from the
spirit that is engendered in its universities and schools
and by its many agencies of morality and refinement
and select such a man for Senator. The State is en
j titled to the service of its best men, its most thought
i ful, and by seeking such service it constantly advances
i its position and encourages young men to hope for
J recognition as a reward for trained intelligence and
| scrupulous fidelity to public trusts. What California
! father can encourage his son in the path of culture
and manliness, in expectation that the common
; wealth may recognize his quality and command his
! service, when the State's highest prize in public life
| has been given to a man like Burns!
Now is the time of trial, and now is the time to
j stand. Let every member stay at his post. The
! Burns men will, as a part of their tactics, readily vote
jto excuse any man whom they cannot control. They
! will be glad to reduce each House to a bare quorum.
| If they can get a joint convention reduced to sixty
-1 two members, a quorum of each House, they enter-
I tain a desperate hope of offering such inducements
!as to secure the thirty- two votes necessary to elect as
I a majority of such a convention. But they have no
i hope of securing enough to make a majority of a full
I convention. In this situation every member who
I seeks a leave of absence and gets it brings Burns
! nearer to the success of his scheme, and cannot evade
j the responsibility of his action.
The cry of the State to her legislators, therefore, is
|to stand to their posts and their duty in these last
j days. It is plain now that if this is done a Senator
can be elected who will be no discredit to the party
or the State, and the future of Republicanism in Cali
fornia can be made safe.
. This is a crisis for the party and the State. If
Burns succeed, when will party leadership be raised
| out of degradation? How many years must pass be
| fore men who have the right to aspire to such a
; high office will be encouraged to appear? How long
j a time must elapse before a Republican can vindicate
the honor of his party before the people? By
j standing firmly now and maintaining the high ideals
> in which it has won, the party will vindicate itself
! and make its future sure by its record alone.
I But, if it fail now, to whom can it look for a vin
j dication? Will Burns undertake to go upon the
i stump next campaign and secure party success by the
display of his intellectual gifts? Will any of his sup
porters perform this office? Three men came to him
after the first ballot. If he is successful they will
naturally have eminence and leadership. Will the
party listen to Wright, Jilson and Simpson? Will it
accept them as examples to follow and samples of its
best intellect and. morality? If Burns win, the party
will have no, choice in the matter. These three will
be held up to the people as the representatives of its
best, and there will be no escape.
The State looks to every man in Sacramento who
j represents its best purposes to do his duty and
stand.
MR. HUNTINGTON'S PROMISE.
COLLIS P. HUNTINGTON has written to
Edward Ivison of Santa Barbara a letter con
cerning the long delay, of the Southern Pacific
Company in closing the gap in the coast road be
tween Surf and Ellwood, the right of way for which
was given by the residents along the route years ago.
As the letter is characteristic of the writer and relates
to a matter of public importance it merits more than
a passing notice.
Mr. Huntington began with the statement: "I am
glad to be able to say something encouraging in the
matter in which you and other residents of your sec
tion are so much interested." He then went on to
say: "We have succeeded in getting Mrs. Stanford
and Mr. George Crocker (who are now in New
York) to agree to go on and close this gap between
Surf and Eilwood as soon as it well can be, at least to
work* up to the economical point, and I hope the
trains will be running through your city in about
twelve months after we get fairly to work."
It appears from this that the delay in the work and
the failure to keep faith with the property-owners
who gave the right of way on the understanding that
the line across the gap was to be completed at once
have been due not to Mr. Huntington, president of
the road, but to his wicked and dilatory partners.
These have at last been won over, and Mr. Hunting
ton now says the encouraging thingâ ,is that
the road will be running through Santa Barbara
within twelve months after the company gets fairly to
work. "v - â -"; ;-.V, -". :
The amount of encouragement in the statement de
pends upon the answer to the question when the com
pany will begin work and get fairly started. A con
siderable number of years have passed since assur
ances were first given to the people between Eilwood
and Surf that the road would be completed speedily
when the company got to work. For all those years,
however, the company has carefully abstained from
getting to work, further than was required to take
possession of the right of way and hold on to it.
Mr. Huntington has just given $1000 to "the Mer
cantile Library fund, and for that he deserves and
will- receive credit and praise. It is a generous deed
well worthy of emulation. It will be seen, however,
that his promise as regards the closing of the gap
has to it a string strong enough to bind the leviathan
or haul a freight train. Since a promise of that kind
was first given the promoters of the Valley road have
constructed a railway from Stockton to Bakersfield
and have advanced far toward completing the con
nection between Stockton and this city. Still the
short gap between Eilwood and Surf remains un
closed. The promise has now become venerable for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 3, 1899.
j its age, but the amount of encouragement in it has
lessened with the years. The people are waiting to
I hear when the company intends to get fairly to work.
SUPREME COURT CONGESTION.
SEVERAL plans for the relief of the Supreme
Court have been placed before the Legislature
and are receiving attentive consideration. For
years that tribunal has been congested to a degree
that has seriously obstructed the administration of
justice in this State. It has had the aid oi a competent
and industrious commission, latterly "of five mem
bers, and yet the congestion is unrelieved, although
to some extent reduced. When seven Justices, with
five assistants, are unable to cope with the appeals
taken in a State with a million and a half of inhabi
tants there must be something wrong with the sys
tem. Upon this point all lawyers and citizens gen
erally will agree. There is no complaint of the court
itself. It is always in session, and the work done by
its members is heavy and thorough. Each case de
mands and receives full consideration, and cannot be
slighted because of the accumulation of records and
the consequent delay. There can be no adequate re
lief without the establishment of an additional court
or additional courts, and this necessarily involves
amendments to the constitution that must satisfy the
public or they will be beaten.
There are rooted evils in the entire judicial system
of the State as administered which affect. the business
of the Supreme Court and require drastic treatment.
The real points on any- Ordinary appeal were for
merly . presented with precision and terseness in a
few pages of print. Now, with rare exceptions, they
have to be dug "out by the Judges from literal trans
cripts of reporters' notes, swelled to absurd propor
tions through professional' indolence or incom
petency at the expense of litigants. It often happens
that the transcriptions of shorthand notes, without
discrimination, and the printing bills are the largest
items in the cost of a lawsuit, and thus the heaviest
work is improperly transferred from the offices of the
lawyers to the chambers of the Judges. But this
class of interferences with justice requires separate
treatment. The immediate remedy, imperatively de
manded by t v s. exigencies of the situation, is a clean
division of labor, so that the Supreme Court may not
be buried under the conglomerated mass of jurisdic
tion by which it is now oppressed.
One of the plans submitted to the Legislature pro
poses the reduction of the number of Supreme Court
Justices to five and the establishment of three inter
mediate courts of appeal, each with three Judges,
and with authority in the Legislature to provide for
additional courts of appeal as the business of the
State may warrant. In many cases the decisions of
these appellate tribunals would be final, but the direct
appeals to the Supreme Court and the instances in
which cases would find their way there from the in
termediate courts of appeal would still be so numer
ous that it is doubtful whether the system would be
an improvement. The main difficulty with this plan.
however, is its cost, liable to be frequently increased
through the exercise of legislative discretion/which
almost certainly would insure its defeat, at the polls.
A more practical and economical scheme,, the sim
plicity and apparent effectiveness of which will prob
ably receive the approbation of the bar and the
bench and also attract the favorable consideration of
the people, is the organization of a new court of ap
peals, to consist of three Justices, to which a large
part of the appellate jurisdiction is to be finally and
exclusively transferred. . It is designed that this j
tribunal shall have sole charge of such appeals as j
may be taken in criminal cases, on questions of law
alone, in actions not based upon though some of them
may originate in contracts and, as the lawyers say,,
sounding in tort, which would include claims for un- ;
liquidated damages, in divorce and alimony suits, and
in "'special cases," such as forcible entry or detainer, -
insolvency proceedings where not superseded by the
national bankruptcy law, suits to prevent or to abate
nuisances, contested election cases and cases of quo
warranto to determine the legal title to public offices.
This transfer of jurisdiction would not throw upon
the new court of appeals an undue proportion of la
bor and of responsibility, and, with an intelligible
line of demarcation, would still leave the Supreme
Court in the possession of appellate jurisdiction over
all cases based upon contract, over all cases involving
the titles or possession of real property, and. except
as to the single instance of divorce, over all cases
sounding in equity. Each court would possess aux
iliary and incidental powers essential to the full exer
cise of its jurisdiction, and, on the point of jurisdic
tion alone, the court of appeals would be under the
control of the Supreme Court, and thus conflict and
confusion would be prevented. In this connection,
moreover, uniformity of decisions would be secured
by a provision' that the rulings of the Supreme Court I
heretofore and hereafter on all questions of practice
and procedure, wherever applicable, shall be binding j
authority in the new tribunal.
The effect of these suggested amendments to. the
constitution would be a great reduction of the volume
of business in the Supreme Court, which would still
retain the most important litigation, affecting com
mercial and financial interests, and, if the present
commission should be continued for four years, it
is confidently anticipated, would be abreast of its
calendar. The court of appeals,. unincumbered when
it started and with its labors held within reasonable)
limits, would be enabled to insure prompt decisions
of the appeals committed to its charge.
It has been suggested that the constitution itself
should provide for the oral argument of all appeals,
and that when a limited number of cases arc sub
mitted further business should be deferred until they
are decided. There are several valid objections to
this detailed specification of methods, however meri
torious in itself. It is clearly â an introduction of
special legislation into an instrument that ought to
consist only of broad outlines.,' It is also an unwar
ranted interference with a discretion that should be
vested in the Judges, and not even in the Legislature.
They are trusted with specific duties, and it is for
them to determine for themselves and through the
rules their knowledge and experience may enable
them to formulate in what manner their work can be
most expeditiously and effectively acomplished. The
community will look to results and will not closely
scrutinize mere preliminaries.
It is certainly strange that the Filipinos should
have 600 American soldiers as prisoners without our
commanding officers missing them at rollcall.
The peculiar form of wit which finds expression in
mutilating the property of a university is something
which should be attended to by the police.
The country will be glad to learn that the packers
of the suspected meat are so confident of its goodness
as to freely swear to it. - -

SHE SIGNED
A DEED WITH
HER LEFT HAND
Carrie E. Sankey Tells
Her Story.
AFFLICTED WITH PARALYSIS
TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF WHILE
IN THIS CONDITION.
Charles S. Coggins Now Admits That
BHe Never Gave His Ward
Money From .the Profits j
of Her Estate. I
After a brief hearing yesterday after
noon Judge Belcher continued the case of
Carrie E. Sankey against her guardian,
Charles 8. Coggins, and his wife, Mary E.
Coggins, until the 14th Inst. Though
brief the hearing elicited facts of inter
est regarding the peculiar transactions
that took . from the young plaintiff her
rights and her property.
Miss Sankey told, the story on Wednes
day of how the profits from her estate
went to benefit her guardian's wife and
furnish luxuries. Yesterday she was
again placed on the stand, and out of the'
tangle of questions and answers the fact
was drawn that one of the deeds signed
by the witness conveying property to her
guardian was prepared and afterward
signed by Miss Sankey when she was suf
fering from paralysis and weak in mind
and body. She was deceived and led to
sign this document, she says, and when
she finally yielded' and was about to af
fix her name the pen fell from her paral
yzed right hand and she was forced to
use her left. The signature on the dead
bears out her statement, as. it- has a back
ward slant and theâ lines are in a trem
bling, broken hand.
After reciting the story of the signing
of the deed when she was partially par
alyzed the young woman gave an ex
planation of the matter in which her
guardian led her to part with her estate.
In addition to the threatened expose, as
told on the stand the first day, Miss San
key said that her guardian and his wife
told her that she had heart disease and
that she might fall dead any day, and in
sisted on always accompanying her
whenever she left the house. They would
not allow her to receive callers unless
Mrs. Coggins was present and took care
that, she never communicated with any
one regarding her estate or her life with
her guardian.
"We went shopping together," said the
witness, "and although Mrs. Coggins al
ways ordered everything I always paid
the bills." Many bills were introduced
In evidence showing purchases of house
hold effects, bric-a-brac and other things
which had been paid by the witness. One
was for the amount of $1047 for goods
purchased, and outside of two Items,
amounting to about $30, Miss Sankey said
that she knew nothing.
In conclusion the.- witness, in order to
show the attitude of her guardian and
his wife toward her, said that one night
she went to see a- lady friend and spent
the night with her. The next morning
Mrs. Coggins > called at the house where
the lady friend resided and said that if
Miss Sankey. did not open the door she
(Mrs. Coggins) would get an ax and
knock it down. Miss Sankey opened the
door and was roundly abused by Mrs.
Coggins. . ; '->.'_.â â¢-â 
â¢When Miss Sankey left the stand a dep
osition signed by Charles S. Coggins was
offered and. placed on record. This depo
t-lon bring- out one important factâ Cog
gins acknowledges that he never paid
Miss Sankey any money out of her es
tate. Miss Sankey alleges that he has
drawn out several thousand dollars and
now the. proof as to what for and where it
was expended is awaited with interest.

An Interesting: test showing the com

furnished by the Equitable and the San

contract for lighting the streets alonÂ»
which its pipes are laid, and .accordingly
invited- Mayor Phelan, Gas Ins ec^ Tup
per and other city officials to judge for
themselves of the merits of the new prod
uct at a public test.
Before the experiments were made J_>r.
Chlsholm said a few words in explana
tion. "Our gas," he said, "is essentially
a fuel gas, and while we do not claim
that its illuminating powers are as great
as that of the old gas, we say that we can
furnish a good light far cheaper than the
old company. This test will be made by
what is known as the 'test meter. As
our gas will not burn with an open burner,
we will use a Welsbach lamp for both
Hl"thcn had the meter attached to one
of the tips, regulated it for a full light
and let it run for a minute. The result
showed that it was burning i.o feet
per hour. Another test made a few min
utes later with the cock turned on full
registered 4.6 feet per hour as a maxi
mum. This gas was drawn from a. chan
delier which had six other lights burning
on it. As the test of the San Francisco
Company's gas was to be made from a
single chandelier another record was
taken from a single chandelier of the
Equitable Company. It showed practically
the same pressure and the same consump
tion.
The product of the old company was
then submitted to a test with the same
meter and the same Welsbach. lamp.
There was no way of recording the candle
power, so the comparative brilliancy of
the two lights had to be guessed at. When
the register of the meter was taken there
was a difference of about 20 per cent, as
It showed that the old company's gas was
running through the meter at a rate vary
ing from 5.S to 5.5 feet per hour. _ *
President Ackerman was well pleased
with the showing made by his product;
"This test does not show as great 1 a dif
ference as some we have made," he said.
"We made a test- last Monday night which
was 25 per cent in our favor, but this last
one is very good. The record shows that
we furnish the same light with 20 per cent
less gas, and we only charge $1 per thou
sand, against $175 charged by the other
companies. Another feature is that our
gas is cleaner. I have here a number of
bottles containing sediment taken from
the pipes of the other company. Our gas
cuts this out and leaves the pipes per
fectly clean. Why, you can cook over our
gas with a silver pan and the bottom.of it
will not be discolored in the least.": .-â¢

C, received several orange trees from
Bahla, Brazil, and they were sent to
Riverside, Cal.. where some were budded
on native trees. Nature attempted to
produce twins, but one of the twins sur
vived merely as a protuberance in the
blossom end of the fruit, forming a little
kernel enveloped In the skin. In the. pro

methods for bluing gun barrels:
For bluing gun barrels by staining, dissolve
4*_ ounces of hyposulphite of soda in one quart
of water, also 1_ ounces of acetate of lead in
one quart of water. Mix the two solutions and
bring to a boil in a porcelain dish or stone pot.
Clean the gun barrel free from grease, oil or
varnish, warm the Barrel and smear with the
hot solution, using a piece of sponge tied to a
stick. When the color develops wash and wipe
dry; finish with boiled linseed oil.
The bluing of gun barrels is also effected by
heating evenly In a muffle until the desired
blue color is raised, the barrel being first
made clean and bright with emery cloth, 'leav
ing no marks of grease or dirt upon the metal
when the .bluing takes place, then allow to cool
In the air. It requires a great deal of experi
ence to obtain an even clear blue.

San Francisco.MEN AND WOMEN
LED TO DISHONOR
THE people of San Francisco are reap- *
4 bitter harvest of disgrace, degrada- !
tion,*"dernora'ization and death from ;
the racetracks.' Homes are being |
wrecked. reputations are being ruined and j
men and women are being made thieves
by the dishonest gamblers who are per- j
mitted to thrive by the authorities at
llngleside.I Ingleside. The gates of San Quentin have
closed 'upon many men who were made ,
convicts by horseracing and the portals j
are open for many more who have lost t
honor and home in the dirty pool created !
In our midst by the horse-gamblers. Men :
hay- fled from their .... hide the
disgrace that came to them on the race
course. Some hav*r found oblivion and 1
escape from the sneers of honest men in
suicide. The public cannot estimate the
terrible damage that --â¢racing has in
flicted upon San Francisco and its citi
zens." : Sj-j v . \v-
These words were spoken yesterday by
one of the most prominent police official**
of this city. The remarks were prompted
â¢by the revelations and scandals which
have found their source in the, last month
at the racetracks. Men and women are
staking their honor, their homes, their
families and even their lives on the un
fvlen hazard of a horserace. When a
Captain Neail abandons his family, dis
graces his uniform and sacrifices his fu
ture "for a pool ticket the police simply i
shrug their shoulders and add another I
r.sme to the black roll that racing gam
blers are writing for the people of San
Francisco.
When a Bernard Ward is place- behind
th_ -bars and some one whispers "the
bookmakers." the police point to the rec
ord of San Quentin and the Morgue. The I
officers are thinking of the McGlades, the
-Norton*, the Welbufns and the Wldbers,
types of hundreds whose lives have been
.wrecked or lost In -lie passion for gam- j
bling which the race tracks have bred in i
this city. r v
I The. evil has become of such terrible
moment that business men have been j
forced to employ spotters and send them
to the poolrooms and the tracks to watch
their employes. In public and private af- .
fairs the racing habit has played sad i
havoc. Merchants are afraid to trust
their own most trusted employes. In
public, offices, such as that of the County
Cterk. signs are conspicuously posted to j
warn deputies that dismissal will be the I
Immediate penalty for attendance at the
race tracks. A dread has seized upon the
custodians of money and the facts war
rant their fear.
The police estimate that in the last six ,
years over 300 men and a few women }
aye come under the observation of the â 
olice for crlme3 committed under the |
irect inspiration of the race track. Not j
11 of these people found their dishon
-ed end in the penitentiary. Some killed

many are even now in the shadow of a
There is no exaggeration in these state
ments, as official records constitute the
proof. The police also estimate that at
least 500 more men and women have es
caped exposure by compromising with the
people they robbed. These compromises
have been accomplished through private j
ietsctlve agencies, and are therefore not |
-.ffirially of record. The list as the au
horities know it. however. is appalling in ;

fugitives from justice or suicides. No
class has been spared and as each new,,
revelation adds to the terrifying list the
public wonders where it Is all going to
end. A reference to a few of those who
have found shame or death in the gam- '
bling of the racecourse will demonstrate
the stern seriousness of the problem and
perhaps suggest a solution-
Few have forgotten the sad story of
I=aac Norton, the cashier in the office of ;
the Collector of Internal Revenue, who i
put a bullet, into his brain after the gam
blers of the racetrack had led him to
ruin. "His chief. Osca M. Welburn. soon
followed in the path of dishonor that the j
horse gamblers have beaten with the feet
of disgraced men and women. Welburn .
staked the happiness of his' family and the â 
future of himself on the bookmakers. He
' lost, and and is now a fugitive from jus
tice.-his home destroyed and his family ,
-cattered.
: The' fate of A. C. Widber. who was City
r Treasurer, is still a, vivid object lesson j
= to. those who care to reflect. He is a
convict at San Quentin. 'and that was but j
one- step In his progress from the race j
course. Bled by gambling thieves, be
fuddled by scheming touts and robbed by i.
â¢unscrupulous bookmakers, he stepped out
of his office In the City Hall to the cell of
a convict at San Quentin.
â¢ Theodore Figel is only an incident in
the long story of shame that records the
existence of the race course in this city.
F}gel was a trusted employe In a large
mercantile firm. He plunged on the races. :
Sent' thousands of dollars to the book
makers, employ- touts and bought
horses. Then he awoke one morning to j
find -.-â '.:" accused of murder and em- '
bezzlement. He was acquitted on both"

the race track never came back to him. j
i The scandalous revelations of the Bot- j
kin case are too fresh in the public mind j
to riec-d petition. The race course sup- (
plied a vicious substitute for home, f_m- '

of a monstrous crime were cheek by jowl j

contributions of his mistress among the
bookmakers and then disgrace and death j
closed the scene on two homes.
The fall of Captain John Neail needs no j
comment. With a future Bright in pros- j

gave up everything, abandoned his wife [
ar.d children, deserted from the United j
States army, robbed his friends and fled .
from the penalty that the law must in

DISGRACE AND DEATH

thing of the enormity of the evil may be
conceived and the justice of police com

than a mention. He is by instinct and
education a criminal. It is natural that
he should be one of the most notorious
horse gamblers known to the turf.
Not long ago two boys. Henry Walker

represented their interest in the gambling

I and declared they had lost all their money
on the races. The reward of their theft,
: paltry as it was, seemed to them sufficient
; to give them a new start in the evil game
â  that has led big and little men In this city
to ruin. The theft of a coat meant dis

Few, perhaps, have forgotten the story
of Jennie Zwald, the little woman who
led a double life until the climax came in
disgrace. She was a bookkeeper in a
downtown mercantile firm. She became
infatuated I with a racehorse tout, and
through him began to bet on the races.
She made her tout her betting commis
sioner, and the firm for which she worked
was robbed of several thousand dollars,
which went into the coffers of the book
maker..
The cases of John Dougherty and Ber
! nard Ward are still occupying the atten

men are accused of robbing the Marine
Fire Insurance Company and the accusa
tion has timely interest from the fact
that both men played the local races
heavily.
The dramatic close to the career of A.
J. Bergmann as a plunger at Ingleside
perhaps has been forgotten. In tha dark
record of crime that the local racetrack
has given to San Francisco such affairs
are numerous enough to be forgotten
quickly. Bergmann was bookkeeper for

ROBBED BY HIS FRIEND.
John L. Baumgardener a Victim of
Misplaced Confidence.
John L. Baumgardener. '.- Mason street,
swore to a complaint in Judge Graham's
court yesterday for the arrest of "John
Doe" on a. charge of grand larceny.
Wednesday night he met a man on Ma
son street whom he thought he recog
nized as an old acquaintance. The man
did not disabuse him of the Idea and they
had a number of drinks at Baumgarden
er's expense. They finally went to Baum- i
gardener's room, where they continued to !

Baumgardener's suspicions were aroused Â»

Ing a term of five years at San Quentin.
She set fire to her home on Taylor street.
She was caught and convicted. When
asked what she Intended to do when she
Is released from prison, she replied calm
ly that she intended to play the races.
Mrs. Eugenia Schuller, who was ac
cused of arson, but was exonerated In
court of all guilt, declared to Fire Mar
shal Towe that she found . the keenest
enjoyment in playing the races. These
women are types of the women who may
be seen any day in the grand stand at
Ingleside.
Perhaps one of __< saddest of all the
tragedies that have their inception at the
race course and their conclusion at the
Morgue is that of William J. Lyons, who
was employed as a trusted bookkeeper by
the Pacific Gas Company. Lyons was led
gradually into the game that thrives at
Ingleside. He won and then lost. He
robbed his employers to recover his losses.
He lost again and stole more. His thefts
became so great that he was forced to
falsify his books. Having falsified his
records he was forced to destroy them,
and In desperation he set fire to the safe.
He was between $4000 and $5000 short in
his cash. Detection was certain and ha
fled from the city. The next day he was
found at Berkeley dead, with a bullet in
his brain. The searchers found twenty
six pool tickets in one of his pockets.
Lyons had played the races to a finish.
The story of Oscar Anderson is a short
one. He robbed Charles Nelson of â¢*_**-. a
month ago and disappeared. The book
makers have the money.
Robert Lawson is perhaps not yet for
gotten as the young man who was clever
enough to Impose upon E. M. Greenway.
Lawson was an inveterate gambler at the
racetrack. and consequently needed
money. He sold Greenway some bottled
water under the pretense that it was a
liniment. That offense was unpunished,
but it was not long before Lawson needed
more money. The races are hard to beat
as they are manipulated on the local
track. Lawson forged the name of Miller
& Lux to a telegram and filched several
hundred dollars from local firms. He was
arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced
to serve a term of two years at San
Quentin. His place of residence was
changed to the County Jail, where he is
now Imprisoned. In his conviction the
local racetrack lost a patron and a vic
tim.
Daniel Lynch, a young fellow who held
creditably a position as bookkeeper for the
firm of Anderson & Co., ship chandlers. is
another convict at San Quentin who owes
the tragedy of his life to Ingleside. Ha
was led to gamble on the races, embezzled
$1200 from his employers and is now serv
ing a term of imprisonment of three
years.
Bayard Saville was one of the pets of
the bookmakers. He was not only a good
fellow, but a good thing, and for his good
fellowship to the crafty gamblers of In
gleside he is now serving at San Quentin
a term of fourteen years for forgery- Sa
ville played the races heavily and lost.
He practiced a forgery upon Mrs. Bell,
was caught and then convicted.
Henry Sloan, who was notorious as a
gambler at the race track, is also at San
Quentin for a term of ten years. He
found it necessary to commit forgery to
play the game. Sloan is well connected
In this city and New York, but he was
utterly ruined by the masters of Ingleside.
The race course never showed itself
more conclusively a feeder for the peni
tentiary than It did in the cases of Ste
phen Rosenbaum, Dr. Starke, W. F.
Rodgers and son. who were all sent
to San Quentin prison as the direct con
sequence of their operations on the race
course. These men had played the races
and lost. They gave up their legitimate
employment, bet and lost all their money
and then schemed to fight the sharks of
the course with their own weapons. The
quartet of gamblers flooded the track
with counterfeit money. Federal detec
tives were placed on the case and the
counterfeiters were soon behind the bars.
Young Rodgers died in prison. His father
and Rosenbaum are still serving their
term. Starke, who is a member of a re
spectable family, was released about a
month ago.
It is not an infrequent Incident that
thieves bite at the game of thieves and
are caught. W. A. Williams, who Is serv
ing a term at San Quentin, is an exam
ple. -Williams is a notorious criminal. Ha
operated in this city and lost his ill-got
ten gains at the race track. He was tha
rascal who forged the name of Leland
Stanford.
J, E. Bachmann is one of the most re
cent victims whose crime has been discov
ered. He was treasurer of a local frater
nal society, and in. that capacity had
charge of a great deal of money. He
thought that he could play against the
bookmakers and he tried. He lost, stole
several thousand dollars from the society
of which he was treasurer and placed the
stolen atony with the bookmakers. De
was caught, tried, convicted and sen
tenced to serve a term of rive years at
San Quentin. He has learned bitterly the
lesson of the track.
John W. Jordan, formerly a porter in
the postoffioe. robbed the mails to play
the races. The game was with him as It
has been for so many. He lost and was
sent to the penitentiary for a year. He
was recently released.
Charles T. Jensen tried another road
that leads to the pool box. He passed sev
eral fictitious checks on local grocers.
His fraud was discovered. He was con
victed and is now at San Quentin for a,
term of two years.
M. Buja is another victim.
James D. Page is still another.
The list is a long one, replete with the
'. tragedy of life in many phases. The peo
! pie of San Francisco are paying dearly
for the luxury of the racecourse. .The
names that have been given do not by
any means complete the roll. They serve
- simply as types for the 300 that have come
beneath the scrutiny of the police and the
500 that have their secret of shame hid
den in the safes of private detectives.
HAS FOUI-ID THE AUTHOR.
James E. Slinkey Discovers the Wo*
man Who Wrote the Anony
mous Letter. ",,"â -* ...
James E. Slinkey yesterday notified Cor-
I oner. Hill that he had discovered the
author of the anonymous letter written
several weeks ago accusing Slinkey of
having murdered his wife.
The wife of Mr. Slinkey committed sui
cide at the Sausalito House on Ellis street
last January by hanging herself. After
the body had been burled Dr. Hill re
ceived a letter Intimating that the woman
had been murdered. Acting on this, the
i body was exhumed by the Coroner, and
after a careful investigation it was, found
that the allegation made in the letter was
false. Dr. Hill told Mr. Slinkey that if he
â¢ could find the author of the letter an ar
j rest would follow.
Since that time Slinkey has been work
ing quietly on* the case, and yesterday he
totk Dr. Hill some letters, the hand
i writing of which corresponds with that of
the anonymous letter. Mr. Slinkey gave
I the name of the author, who is a woman,
| to Dr. Hill, and the latter wrote the
i woman requesting her to call at the Cor
j oner's office this morning. In case the
' woman does not comply with the doctor s
request a warrant will be sworn out for
her arrest. Dr. Hill and Mr. Slinkey both
I refused to give the name of the- woman.

OUR ACCOUNT WITH SPAIN.
AND OUR STANDING AS TO EXPORTS AND
IMPORTS. j
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"It is true that some misgivings may seem
to be suggested by the fact that we shall soon
have to remit $20,000,000 to Spain on account of ;
the peace settlement. And it is quite possible ,
that this operation, coming outside the ordi
nary transactions of the exchanges, may in \
some measure harden the local rate of Interest. 1
And yet, for these extraordinary times, this la 1
a relatively small matter. The available re
sources for making the settlement are super
abundantly ample. Outside the gold reserve,
the treasury has an available cash balance in |
its vaults of 886,000,000 and 886,000,000 on deposit
with the national banks. There ls thus ample
______ for the treasury avoiding any demand ,
upon its depositories in this city calculated to
sensibly disturb the loan market; and what it
can do In that matter it is quite likely to do. j
There is in Europe, however, a still large out
standing floating indebtedness due on demand ,
to the United States. A slight advance in the ;
rate of interest here would make it a paying
operation to effect the 820.000.0-10 remittance
through bills drawn against these funds; la j
which case there would be no transfers of :
money In the operation, Spain collecting her |
award from our European debtors and the
operation at this end being confined to trans- ;
fers of deposits, with little or possibly no effect
upon the loaning ability of the New lork
banks This remittance to Spain therefore, â 
come when it may, Is not likely to cause any
noteworthy disturbance of the local money |
market.
"It begins to appear probable that we are j
entering upon an appreciable abatement of the
extraordinary surplus of exports over imports
that has prevailed for the last eighteen months.
The imports are gaining upon the figures of
several mdnths past. The January figures are !
about $10,000,000 below those of 1*95 and 1896
respectively, but they exceed those of 189S by
87.600,000 and those of 1897 by 87,100.000. The
exports for January exceed those for the like !
month in any previous year, being $7,500,000
above those of 1898, the next highest ante- j
cedent yearâbut they fall 818,200.000 below the
average for December, November and October,
which is no more than is due. however, to the j
usual curtailment of shipments after the close (
of the year. The January excess of merchan
dise exports over imports, however, has fallen j
to the standard of one year ago, namely $57,
--000 000 which is $25,700,000 below the balance -
fcr' December. $20,600,00-) below November, j
ja poo ivio less than October and 814.400,000 over 'â 
September. Still, the January balance is at I
the rate of 8685.000,000 per annum. These facts '
Indicate that the accumulation of balances to
our credit in Europe must have very much more â 
than sufficed for offsetting the extraordinary
return of home securities since the beginning
of January, and it seems reasonable to infer
that the liquidation of the settlement with
Spain must leave still a very large sum to our
ered't abroad, liable to be liquidated in gold j
upon our demand."
THE LUMBER TRADE.
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron thus reviews the
lumber- trade in February:
"The receipts of lumber, both redwood and
spruce, show quite an Increase, but there is
no change to note in prices. The foreign de
mand keeps up and the Humboldt mills are
prepared to keep up with their orders. The !
air is full of rumors of consolidations of various ;
redwood interests, but nothing really definite I
has come to the surface and may not for some
future time, but it cannot be denied that the j
redwood prospects are brighter than they have !
b*en for years, and it Is hoped that the manu- j
facturers will scon be on Easy street.
"As to shingles, the market is practically
in the same condition as when last reported ,
in Wood and Iron, but the time is imminent
when the strong, carefully worked Eastern field
will receive its attention, and then the red
wood shingle will be where its superior quali- I
ties should place itâ the head and above all ,
other classes and grades. The coming spring
must result in an influx of orders for a grow
ing Eastern demand has been naturally created.
"Hardwoods are where they were last month,
save that there seems to be an increasing local
demand and prices are firm and responsive.
The extreme climatic conditions prevailing j
during the month of February' have made the !
lumber business practically non est. Such is
the radical difference between the West and
the East, for the business in the lumber trade i
circles of the first named section is good an
encouraging and in the latter actually at a
standstill."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
J
NEW YORK. March The stock market
displayed weakness, particularly the Grangers
and specialties, practically all day with but
incidental rallies. There, was an appearance
of support of certain stocks In the final deal
ings which caused a fairly steady close, al
though the Grangers were still under pres
sure. There was no news to account for
the decline except a firmer tone to money,
call rates touching 3*_, attributable to call
issued preliminary to the settlement between
the Central Pacific Railroad and the Govern
ment. The easier tone of sterling exchange
was a natural accompaniment of the firmer
tone in money, indicating that an Increased
demand for money might contract, the volume
of American funds now loaned abroad. There
were denials from bank officials of the cur
rent assertion that undue discrimination was
being exercised against the Industrial collater
al. Selling orders appeared from Boston. and
Chicago houses, and London, while trading
both ways moderately, took rather less stock
â¢ than it sold. By the bear attacks, many
stop-loss orders were uncovered which ac
celerated the decline. The weakness ; affected
nearly everything, while especially heavy fea
tures were Metropolitan, Jersey Central,. Pacific
Mail, Pittsburg, C. C. and St. Louis, Rubber
and Brooklyn Transit. American Tobacco left
oft" with a gain of 2_ on the formal action
of the directors preliminary to the absorption
of the Union Company. ,-.?
The bond market to-day bore up remarkably
well, considering the pressure against stocks.
Some Issues made an aggressive show of
â¢U-Urth, particularly Louisville, Evansvllle
and St. Louis 6s, which rose 3 points. Atchi
son adjustments had good backing^ and the
St. Louis Southwestern issues were better sup
ported, than for some days. Operations else
where were somewhat irregular, but there were
no conspicuous losses outside of Southern Rail
way 6s, and Standard Rope and income.
The new Central Pacific and Southern Pa
cific bonds issued in connection with the re
habilitation of the Central Pacific Railroad,
were dealt in to-day. but ran off from the
high prices in sympathy with the weakness

CALIFORNIA RAISINS IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK. March 2.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The impression among those here
who have closely watched recent developments
in the Coast raisin industry is that yesterday's
meeting would result in no definite action.
Postponement for a week or more would prob
ably hÂ» had, and during the interval every
effort would be made to secisre the co-operation
of recalcitrant growers. Even in the event of
final failure to reorganize the association, little
fear seems to be felt that the market will be
come demoralized by dumping upon it the bal
ance of the stock controlled by the association.
Officers of the association, it is claimed, have
virtually made a contract with every Jobber
who has bought not to permit the market to
decline below prices fixed by the association
during the balance of th* season, and it is con
fidently believed that they will carry out the
agreement made several weeks ago. when reso
lutions were passed to sell what stock re
maleiKi. If not taken by regular distributors.
to wineries or for export. The stock held by
1 the association is said not to exceed 600 cars,
though in pome quarters it is believed to be 100
or 200 carp more. Whether 600 or 800 cars, this
stock is understood to represent almost the
entire holdings of first hands on the Coast,
outsiders having little or nothing left. Last
year at this time the visible supply in first
hands exceeded 1000 cars. Thus, while there
may be no renewal of the growers' agreement,
'conservative pporl? believe there is little rea
son to expect there will be much if any decline
in prices should the combination not be con
tinued particularly, as present supplies in the
hands of distributers In the East are com
paratively light and the stock now in sight
will have to supply the market for at least six
months to come.

PORTLAND, Or., March 2.â The Eastern and
foreign wheat markets were lower to-day, and
this had a depressing effect upon the local
market. The market though has been forced
. so much during the past few days that most of
I the pressing demands have been met and buy
ers are less inclined to do business at any

quoted at 5Sc to 59c, and a round lot of heavy

The Hot Spring* Poolrooms "Killed**
Over Her Victory â Race
Will Bear Investigation*
Four Beaten Choices.
Fred Foster, the astute Eastern horse
man, paraded his 510,000 beauty, Yellow
Tail, at Oakland track yesterday. The
giant chestnut colt was asked to beat a
very moderate field, and opened a 1 to 2
favorite. Later 4to 5 and a trifle better
was obtainable. Piggott had the mount,
and the youngster displayed about as
much speed as a "yaller daw**," finish
ing a forlorn looking fifth, after sprawl
ing all over the track the last part. Fla
mora, the entry of Ed Purser, and 5 and
6to 1, won easily from Winyah. The
.latter, with Nash Turner In the saddle,
was the supposed good thing in the race.
As an excuse tor the favorite's miserable
showing. It was said that the going,
which was muddy and holding, did not
suit him. When owned by Burns &
Waterhouse he showed a decided ten
dency for damp footing.
Now comes a report from Hot Springs,
Ark., received last evening, stating that
the pool rooms there were "killed" over
the victory of Flamora, thousands of dol
lars being won by a certain clique on the
Purser entry. The bettors, so the ad
vices say, who executed the coup, were
the ones that*" made the big clean-up over
the win of Tammany Hall, when the Mon
tana horse downed Foster's sprinter
Abuse some days ago. On that occasion
Poster claimed to have lost a small for
tune on his horse, and because of his
defeat Cash Sloan, who piloted him, was
Indefinitely suspended.
. In the face of this latest information
It looks as if Sloan should have a rehear
ing, and two or three races of Mr. Fos
ter's horses ventilated with possible
pleasant results by the board of stewards
at the track across the bay.
The only other striking feature of the
sport was the run made by Peter Weber.
As good as 400 to 1 was laid against the
outsider, and he finished second to Good
Hope. Two or three books chalked up 10-3
to 1 that he would not run second. Two
favorites only were successful.
There was no pronounced favorite for
the 'opening seven furlong run, Carrie U
and Stan Powers dividing the honors at
post time. The latter ran third. At the
wire the 6 to 1 chance Rosemaid won eas
ily from Bliss Rucker.
rieber's gelding, Sweet William, next
gave the crowd a tired feeling. Closing
a mild choice for the sprint thai fol
lowed, he ended up in third place, after
closing up a lot of ground lost at the
start. Leading from the jump, Rieardo,
â¢a 4 to 1 chance, led New Moon over the
line a length.
In the fourth number, a six furlong

FAMOUS LIGHTWEIGHTS
WILL MEET TO-NIGHT
DAL HAWKINS and Frank Erne of Buffalo, N. T., will enter the Tin-s
--at Woodward's Pavilion this evening at 8:30 o'clock sharp. The
lightweights, according to agreement, will box twenty rounds. Haw
kins is a favorite with the local betting men, but Erne will have
plenty of Eastern money to back him when the pools open this evening.
Joe Choynski will referee the game and a better selection could not be
made. The battle should be well worth going a long distance to see.
dash, Good Hope had nothing much to
beat, and starting a pronounced cholc
won easing up. Peter Weber took the
place from Bonibel.
A 1 to 3 favorite, Rubicon, ridden by
Bullman. downed Satsuma a nose for the
handicap at six furlongs. The latter
horse looked to have the race won at
the paddock, and no doubt careless rid
ing on the part of Jones lost it. Pat Mur
phy* finished third.
The concluding- seven furlong run saw
Don Gara in front from start to finish.
The brown horse, with Piggott up, re
ceived strong support at odds of 4 and
5 to L Roadrunner disposed of Colonial
Dame for the place.

W. H. Martin, the disgraced jockey, "on
his staff." On the day that Ulra was

I lor told Johnny Howard that he would
like to lay against the gelding. At the
same time Owner Taylor was telling his ;
! friends to get aboard < that his horse
looked a "moral." 11m ran unplaced.
"Moose" claims an injustice has been
I done him, and that he will be able to ex- â¢

COMMISSIONER NORTH
DISMISSES NINE MEN
AGREES TO DISCHARGE OF JAPS
INDICTED FOR BRIBERY.
Doubtful Whether the Men Could Be
Convicted, as They Had an
Ingenious Defense.
J. Tnri and Y. Nishloka, Japanese Immi
grants, pleaded guilty In the United
States District Court yesterday of having
paid money to Deputy Immigration Com
missioner Geffeney for the purpose of in
fluencing his decision as to their right to
land.
Tari and Nishloka were Indicted with
nine others by the Federal Grand Jury for
the offense named.; On the Immigrants
being lined up by the Commissioner in
the cabin, Tar! and Nishloka walked up
to the table at which Geffeney was sit
ting and each slipped a $5 gold piece Into
his hand under the table. The nine fol
lowed their example, but placed the $5
coins on top of the table. The two lead
ers, however, Informed Geffeney that
there would be more money coming after
they were landed.
At the request of United States Attor
ney Foote, â¢ represented, by Assistant
United States Attorney Banning, a nolle
prosequi was yesterday entered In the
case of the nine remaining prisoners. The
defendants engaged Bert Schlestnger to
defend them, and the ingenious defense
was set up that they had been informed
at Kobe by the agent of the steamship
company that they would be required to
pay a fee of $5 each to the Immigration
Commissioner before he would allow them
to land. Under this plea and the fact that
the men paid the money to Geffeney in an
open manner, and that they were entitled
to land, It was argued that a conviction
could not be had.
Mr. Banning, in pursuance of a rule of
his office, consulted Immigration Com
missioner North as to the course to be
pursued, and Mr. North, through Mr.
Geffeney, informed Mr. Banning that the
suggested dismissal of the cases would
be satisfactory to him. Upon this assur
ance, Mr. Banning went into court and
procured the dismissal of the cases.
The two defendants who pleaded guilty
will be sentenced on Saturday.

SAYS LILLIAN
BRANDES DIED
OF PNEUMONIA
Remarkable Opinion
of Dr. Muller.
DEFENSE'S HOPES RUN HIGH
BRANDES WILL TESTIFY IN HIS
OWN BEHALF.
Queer Ideas on the Flexibility of a ,
Skull and Absence of External
Symptoms in Hang
ing.
;
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, i
908 Broadway, March 2. i
William A. Brandes, the accused raur- \
derer of his daughter, will bo given an I
opportunity to relate bis theory of his ;
daughter death to the jury. Mrs. Etta
Brandes. who is also charged with mur- â 
der, will also be called as a witness. This j
was decided upon late this afternoon by j
Attorneys Sawyer and Bennett, who have ;
been conducting Brandos' defense.
While interest in the now celebrated j
case lagged somewhat to-day, there were j
some most remarkable statements made j
by the medical expert- called by the de- I
fense.
Dr. G. L. Eaton, who had never exam- I
ined the body of the dead girl, testified j
that his office is next to that" of Dr. E. H. i
Woolsey, the defense's chief medical ex- j
pert; that he had carefully read the I
transcript of the testimony adduced at the ;
preliminary examination and that he dis- j
cussed the case with Dr. Woolsey at con- I
siderable length. He gave it as his opin
ion that Lillian Brandos had died by |
hanging: that the bruises. marks and mot- j
tled appearnce of the dead girl's limbs j
.were post mortem, and were evidence of |
hanging. 1*
On cross-examination Dr. Eaton gave
some remarkable opinions. He was hand- I
ed the skull cap of the dead girl, and i
regarded It as the skull of a person be- 1
tween 20 and 22 years of age. Lillian
Brandes was 13 years of age at the time I
of her death. He stated that the bones of !
the skull of an Infant, even at the time I
of delivery, could not be bent by Instru- j
ments, but that the skull would more |
Jikelv be broken. On the subject of hang
ing, witness stated that in all such cases
there is found congestion of the lungs
and mÂ«ir* or less congestion of the brain :
substance. He said as an absolute fact i
that In hanging there are commonly no ]
external symptoms, neither in cases of
suicidal hanging nor Judicial execution, j
and that death by hanging was caused by
the pressure on the pneumogastric nerve,
and that such pressure was heavier in :
suicidal hanging than in cases of judicial !
execution.
Dr. H. E. Muller, the next expert wit- \
ness for the defense, made perhaps the j
most startling statement from a medical ,
standpoint that has been given at the i
trial. He said that the adhesions of the !
membranes, as found in the case of Lil- j
lian, were due to pleuro-pneumonla, which i
caused the adhesions of the pleura in the I
lower half of the right lung; that the
meningitis which produced those adhe
sions was an incidental complication to the |
pleuro - pneumonia; that persons who
have this condition of the membranes, fol- I
lowing these cases of pleuro-pneumo
nla, are liable to be mentally and mor- j
ally disturbed, and that such cases are !
frequently found in insane asylums.
Dr. Muller went still further by stat
ing that the meningitis as found in the
case of Lillian Brandes. as shown by the
prosecution, was not sufficient to kill the
child. ; l
The defense now bases its main hopes
upon the theory that the prosecution must :
rely upon shock as the cause of Lillian's i
death, and that this shock, between the j
time of the infliction of the blow on the i
head and the time of death, nearly four
days later, would have spent itself and
would not have been present as a disturb
ing force at the time of death.
Dr. Muller will again occupy the stand
to-morrow, and thereafter the defense has
but two more medical experts to offerâ i
Drs. Pratt and Crowleyâ and early next ,
week the accused murderer and his ac- ;
cused wife will be called. It Is expected
the case will reach the jury for deliber- !
ation by the end of next week.
The weary trial is weighing heavily on
Brandos. His bearded face is decidedly >
pale his eyes have lost their luster, and
he appears to be laboring constantly un
der great mental strain and agony. At j
times he seems greatly bored, and to-day i
he was unusually nervous.
PLOT IN THE FELIZ
DIVORCE THICKENS
ATTORNEY CONNERS JOINED AS
A DEFENDANT.
Mrs. Feliz Charges Her Husband
With. Unscrupulous Trans
actions.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 2.
The plot thickens in the divorce suit of
Refugio Bernal Feliz against Joee Feliz,
on the ground of desertion, and defend
ant's attorney, D. M. Conners, is to be
made a defendant. Notice to that effect
was filed to-day by plaintiff's attorneys,
William Bailey and Carl Wood, who will
on next Monday also move that their
client be permitted to filo an amended
supplemental complaint.
The latter pleading will set forth that
when Refugio Bernal Feliz married Jose
on December 26, 1885. she possessed a 200
--acre ranch near Pleasanton, and, being
desirous of also owning two town lots In
Livermore, and reposing confidence in her
newly acquired Jose, she gave him money
wherewith to purchase for her the cher
ished property. Instead, Jose had an un
divided one-half interest vested in his
name, and after plaintiff had expended
$1000 in improvements on the lots Jose
mortgaged one-half . interest to D. M.
Conners as security for a promissory note
for $225. bearing date February 10, 1899.
The amended supplemental complaint
will also allege that on February 13 last
Jose, without any consideration, pretend
ed to convey by deed to Antonio B.
Mezzo an undivided one-half interest in
the property. Mrs. Feliz therefore asks
that Mezzo, too, be made a defendant.
Mrs. Feliz alleges that. she Is not versed
in the vernacular, and therefore did not
understand what her deserting husband
was about. She asks that deeds and mort
gage be declared void and that the court
decree the property as being held in trust
for her. -'"â ',"; '":%â

Oakland Office San Francisco Call, !
908 Broadway, March 2.
The 1500 voters In the annexed district '
have no longer any doubt as to their mu
nicipal standing, for the Supreme Court
handed down an opinion to-day declaring
that the annexed territory is legally a
part of Oakland.
The main point of contention was a i
technical one, based on the apparent il
legality of incorporating outlying terri
tory which was already divided into in
corporated sanitary districts. The Su
preme Court reviewed the matter at some
length and disposes of all the objections.
It was supposed from the first that the
annexation project having obtained the
necessary two-thirds vote, would be sus
tained by the court on the general prin
ciple that courts are always reticent
about upsetting the expressed will of the
people. The case was brought by Thomas
Cuff, who appealed from the decision of
the Superior Court affirming the annexa
tion. City Attorney Dow conducted the
case for the city. *â â â  V-;.
The political complexion of this new
territory will be tested on the 13th of this
month for the first time in a municipal
election. The district is claimed by both
parties, and if public opinion in the an
nex is of the same variety and as change
able as that of Oakland It would be hard
to guess which side has a majority.
The sorrow that has como to the home
of Mr. Snow cannot help but have a
marked effect on the political campaign
now pending. John L. Davie has stated
that it was understood between him and
Mr. Snow that this campaign should not
be one of vilification, and now that Mr.
Snow i_ perforce removed from the plat
form it is apparent that decency should
prevail and that little more real cam
paigning can be done.
Mr. Snow, prior to the death of his wife,
had prepared a speech which he Intended
to use through the campaign. This
speech has been given out for publica
tion and shows very clearly how* the Re
publican standard bearer stands on pub
lic questions. Regarding the important
question of Oakland's water supply, Mr.
Snow says:
<â¢> Meanwhile the fixing- of water rates 1? â¢$>

â â¢â¢ rock still lies mid-stream wrecking: year <$â¢

â¢**â¢ that the Supreme Court of this State has <Â»>

<â¢> effect that, re.anlless of the actual <â¢>

<|> Council shall fix rates for water that >:â¢>
Â«Â» shall return to the owners an Income up- <J>

<â¦> tunity to modify its opinion or reverse <$â¢

<!> water rate question. It is time to elect 4>
<Â«> a government In Oakland that will look _âº
<j> after the interest of the rate payer. The <â¢>
<Â§Â» water companies are able to look after <$.

<*> of the cities and towns around the bay â â¢â¢

SAVED BY TIMELY NERVE.
! Narrow Escape From Being Burned
to Death.
ALAMEDA. March 2.â By the presence
of mind this evening of Christina Olsen, a
domestic employed at the home of Lewis
E. Spear, 1625 Dayton avenue; Miss Anita
Lopez, a nursegirl, was saved from a hor
rible death. The young lady was seated
In the kitchen near a hanging lamp, which
fell from its fastenings and breaking on
the floor enveloped her In blazing coal oil.
j The frightened girl ran from the kitchen
I to the dining room, her clothing in flames.
! screaming with pain as the Are reached
I her body Miss Olsen, who was n the
â¢ front part of the house, was attracted by
I her piercing screams and ran to her as-
I sistance. Taking in the situation at a
glance Miss Olsen grabbed a table coyer
i and hurriedly wrapped It about Miss Lo
pez, smothering the flames.
I The injured girl's hair was singed, her
face considerably scorched and her right
i limb quite seriously burned. A physician
i was summoned, and after dressing the in
! juries stated that while the burns were
painful they were not of a very serious
nature. The girl's skirts and undercloth
! ing were burned almost to ashes, and her
' escape from death was miraculous. *
In the meantime the burning oil had set
j Are to the woodwork of the kitchen, which
! blazed briskly, but was extinguished by
I Louis Jacob! Jr. and Charles Wheat on,
! neighbors, before the arrival of the Sher
: man street hose wagon, which responded
! to a stil alarm sent in about 8:30 o'clock.
YOUNG MRS. LEVISON
DENIED A DIVORCE
UNABLE TO PROVE . LEGALITY
OF HER MARRIAGE.
Her Alleged Husand Is Accused of
Successfully Deceiving Her
for Fourteen Years.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 2.
Young Mrs. Levison has been denied a
divorce by Judge Ellsworth, because, ow
ing to an alleged deception on the part of
her second husband, she is unable to
prove that she was legally free to con
tract a marriage with Levison twelve
years ago. â¢'â¢â¢' "-
When a girl, a little over 14 years old,
Mrs. Levison was Induced In Lewis and
Clarke County Oregon, to marry a man
named Mullin. She lived with him in the
forests for a few weeks, and at the end
of that time they were so mutually dis
tasteful to each other that they parted
willingly. Levison came on the scene, and
being more agreeable to the girl made love
to her with complete success. Mullin was
perfectly willing that his bride of a month
should obtain a divorce, and both he and
Levison assured her, so she claims, that
the necessary legal steps had been taken
toward that end. Believing herself at lib
erty matrimonially, Mrs. Mullin married
Levison by contract, and the relatives on
both sides regarded them as husband and
wife for a period of twelve years, during
which five children were born. Finally
Levison made himself very objectionable
and left his home. Mrs. Levison brought
suit for divorce on the ground of deser
tion, but was not able to prove to the sat
isfaction of the court that she was di
vorced from her first husband thirteen
years ago.
A few months ago Levison obtained
some notoriety in this city by declaring
he had swallowed a bottle of strychnine
because of his matrimonial sorrows, but
Mrs. Levison's friends declare that this
was simply a subterfuge on his part to
obtain sympathy. His wife is now living
in San Jose, working hard to support her
numerous family, and Levison is in the
employ of the lighthouse service on Goat
Island, but is not doing anything to
lighten his wife's burden.

ANNEXATION
TO OAKLAND
WAS PROPER
The Decision of the
Supreme Court.
SALOON-KEEPERS DEFEATED
WILL HAVE TO PAY A BIG MU
NICIPAL LICENSE.
The Newly Acquired Territory Sure
to Cut an Important Figure
in the Coming City
Election.
The Supreme Court has rendered a de
cision in the big Oakland annexation case,
holding that the annexation is legal.
While the matter is directly of great Im
portance to the people residing In the old
Lorin and Golden Gate districts, as well
as to the residents of Oakland, the deci
sion is far-reaching, as it will apply to
many municipalities all over the State
where enlargement of municipal territory
ls or may be contemplated. The facts of
the case as presented to the higher court
i are interesting. ' '.'.â¢â 
After the annexation of a large '.iec
of territory on the north of Oakland to
the city in the manner prescribed by l:Â«w,
action was begun to have the proceedings
declared illegal and void. ; The Superior
Court of Alameda County decided that
the annexation was legal.
From all accounts, those who were most
bitter In opposition to annexation were
about thirteen saloon-keepers, who were
anxious to avoid the payment of the mu
nicipal liquor license of $400 a year instead
of $100, the amount of the license of the
outside districts. Acting upon the deci
sion of the lower court, all of the political
parties in the annexed districts nominated
candidates for the offices of the Oakland
j municipality, that are to be filled by the
election that Is to take place on the 13th
of this month. In the meantime, the ap-
I peal had been taken to the higher court,
and, realizing the necessity of having a
j decision to avoid getting matters badly
I muddled, the Supreme Court consented
I to advance the case Instead of letting It
I take its regular course and come up in
I a year or so. The final opinion was writ
i ten by Commissioner Hayne, and Chief
! Justice Beatty added a concurring opin
ion.
Commissioner Hayne briefly states the
case by saying that it was to determine
the validity of proceedings under which
Oakland claims the territory lying north
of her charter line to the town of Berke
ley. The annexed territory includes the
whole of Adeline sanitary district and
part of Golden Gate sanitary district, and
the contention was made that sanitary
districts cannot be annexed to an Incor
porated town or city under the act of 1889,
under which the proceedings in question
were had. Relative to this the court in
part says:
This contention is based upon the proposition
that two public corporations cannot exist in the
same territory when the powers conferred upon
each conflict one with the other, and that the
powers conferred upon each do conflict; that
sanitary districts cannot be dissolved by an
nexation proceedings under the act of 1889. but
only In the special way provided by the sani
tary act under which they were organized, and
if they can be annexed to the city it must be
under the statute providing for the consolida
tion of municipal corporations.
It may be conceded at the outset that sani
tary districts are public corporations, though
not designated as corporations by the statute,
and that all their powers, duties and privi
leges arc_uch as are incident to municipal cor
porations formed under the municipal govern
ment act or existing under freeholders' charters,
though not possessing many of the Important
powers, duties and privileges of the latter, and
that the same powers could not after annexa
tion be exercised by each In the same territory.
But if the statute permits territory embraced In
or covered by a sanitary district to be annexed
to a city municipal corporation of a higher
class and capable of exercising the same func
tions as well as others essential to municipal
government such statute contemplates a ces
sion of the powers of the inferior corporation to
the greater, and a consequent dissolution of the
former as a result of the annexation.
If the territory* embraced in these sanitary
districts had chosen to incorporate under the
statute as a town or a city instead of becom
ing annexed to the city of Oakland it cer
tainly could not have been necessary as a pre
liminary to such Incorporation to disincorpo
rate as such sanitary districts, since by the in
corporation they would have preserved every
right and privilege they had before, and would
at the same time acquire other rights and
additional powers which would enable them
the better to preserve and secure all the rights
they had as sanitary districts; and jif > they
might incorporate as a town or city without
first dissolving the prior incorporation, no rea
son is perceived why they could not accom
plish the same thing by becoming annexed to
an existing municipal corporation, under the
act of 1889.
This statute unquestionably authorized the
annexation of the territory here in question un
less appellant's further contention can be sus
tained, viz.: that these districts were munici
pal corporations, and the proceedings to ac
complish the union of this territory with the
city of Oakland should have been taken under
section 8 of the act of 18S3.
The court holds that the suggestion
that difficulties might arise out of the
division of Golden Gate Sanitary District,
a part of which is not annexed, need not
cause apprehension, as the act providing
for the creation of Such districts also
provides for their dissolution.
The appellant's second point is: "There
is no law under which to add the an
nexed territory to any wards, so as to
enable the duly qualified electors residing
In the annexed territory to use the elec
tive franchise to which they are entitled
under the constitution."
To this the court answers by calling
attention to the Oakland charter, which
provides that the city shall be redls
trlcted Into seven wards every ten years,
so long as this is not done within ninety
days previous to an election. In altering
the boundaries of the wards, or creating
new wards, regard must be had to the
number of inhabitants, so that each ward
shall contain, *as near as may be, an equal
number of inhabitants, exclusive of per
sons incapable of citizenship in this
State. ______
The City Council adopted an ordinance
changing the boundaries of the Second
Ward, and the contention was that It had
no power to do so. â  .. â¢â _*â¢_;_*
On this -point the court, speaking of the
power given by the Legislature to make
such changes, says:
It is enacted that the boundary of the ad
jacent ward or ; wards shall be changed so as
to Include the added territory. As the city of
Oakland is limited to seven wards by Its char
ter the annexed territory was properly added
to "the Second Ward.- This. I think, could be
done without violation of Its charter. Section
25 of the charter, while requiring that the city
shall be redistrlcted Into seven .wards every
tenth year, does not prohibit a change of
boundaries at other times.
It seems that there were two petitions
for annexation, the first being Imperfect
in its designation of the boundaries of
the new territory- The second was acted
upon by the Council. The appellant ar
gued that in this there was irregularity.
The court held that no one was Injured
by the failure to submit the first to a I
vote. The lower court was sustained.

SWAIN WOULD
NOT KISS AND
BE FRIENDS
Architect's Wife Sues
for Divorce.
THE CHARGE IS DESERTION
NO CONTEST AND NO SENSA
TIONAL DEVELOPMENTS.
Parties to the Suit Amicably Settle
Out of Court All Questions in
Connection With Division
of the Property.
There are to be no sensational develop
ments in the Swain divorce suit. The
complaint which has just been filed by
Mrs. Wilhelmina Swain charges the hus
j band, Edward R. Swain, the architect,
â¢ with desertion, and the many charges
gossip has been wont to promise when
the suit came to trial are completely ig
nored.
The troubles of the couple have been
more or less freely discussed by their
friends for something more than a year.
At the beginning of the estrangement
there was some mention of a woman in
the. case, but the mysterious female has
since been lost to sight. In fact, those
in a position to know declare that Mrs.
Swain was most anxious for a reconcilia
tion with her recalcitrant spouse,, but
i that ail her overtures to kiss and make
up were ignored. Judge Denson of the
firm of Denson, Oatman & Denson, Mrs.
Swain's attorney, is authority for the
statement that the proceedings for di
vorce are just the natural result of a
I "cooling off" on both sides.
. The suit will not be contested. It is un
| derstood that the matter of property di
! vision has been satisfactorily settled by
i the unhappy couple and a large sum set
! tied upon the wife, so that the question of
I alimony ill not be raised by her.
The Swains were married March 28, 1888.
I The fruit of the union was one child,
who died several years ago. Mr. Swain
] is best known locally as the architect
j of the ferry depot. He is represented In
the suit by Linforth & Whittaker.
Mrs. Swain has a residence at 412 Leav
! enworth street, but spends- the greater
' Bart of her time with her sister, Mrs.
I >alv, at the latter's Oakland home. Mr.
: Swain is keeping bachelor's hall at 500

NO WARRANT YET
ISSUED FOR SHARPE
HAS NOT RETURNED TO HIS
LOCKED OFFICE.
Miss Jacobson's Ante-Mortem State
ment in District Attor
ney's Hands.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 2.
Dr. C. J. Sharpe is in no danger of ar
rest. He has not been at his office on
Washington street since he knew that
Miss Jacobson had made an ante-mortem
statement directly charging him with be
ing responsible for her death, and It has
been frequently reported that he is elud
ing the police. It was learned to-day that
the police* are not looking for him and
that the warrant supposed to have been
issued is not in existence. It Is known
that Dr. Sharpe was at his. office the day
after Miss Jacobson's death and it is
believed that he is now in San Fran-
Cisco.
The Coroner's jury did not bring In .
verdict charging Dr. Sharpe with the
murder of Miss Jacobson, and it was gen
erally understood that a warrant had
been issued from the District. Attorney's
office. No warrant has been issued by
either the District Attorney or the Coro
ner, and therefore no search, is being
made for the missing doctor. Should he
return to his office It Is likely that a
warrant would be Issued, but no one has
taken the Initiative.
The ante-mortem statement of Miss Ja
cobson in the possession of the District
Attorney was not presented at the Coro
ner's Inquest and its contents were not
known to the jurors.
DISPUTE OVER THE BALLOT.
All Alameda Candidates Likely to Be
Designated as Independents.
ALAMEDA, March 2.â is probable
that when the Alameda voter goes to
stamp his ballot at the April election he
will be unable to distinguish a Municipal
League candidate from a Harmonic Hall
nominee. All candidates will be alike to
him, for they will, in all probability, be
designated only as "Independents."
When City Clerk Lamborn announced
that he Intended to give all nominees and
parties a fair deal on the official ballot
Attorney R. B. Tappan threatened to apÂ«
ply to the Superior Court for a writ of
prohibition if he attempted to place the
designation "Municipal League" after the
names of any of the office seekers, claim
ing that the league- was not a recognized
political body under the law.
"If the question is submitted to the
courts," said the City Clerk to-day, "I
believe they, will decide in favor of Tap-
San's contention. But in retaliation the
lunlclpal League people will strive to
keep any mention of Harmonle Hall- off
the ballots on- the same grounds that
Tappan advances, and I think the courts
would sustain the league also."
The league appointed a committee at
Its last meeting to arrange to take the
proceedings indicated by Mr. Lamborn if
it was thought advisable.

CHINESE FISHERMEN
CAUGHT RED HANDED
Crew of a "Junk" Placed Under Arrest
by Constable Creed of Sausalito for
Using Prohibited Nets.
Celestials Bewail Their Fate and Protest That
They Have Been Paying $10 a Month Per
Boat for Protection.
A Chinese fishing junk was towed Into
Bausalito harbor last night with a strange
crew at helm and sheet. Instead of the
usual Celestial* navigator in charge. Con
stable Creed of Marin County did the
steering. The Chinese crew were prison
ers, and they were content to remain in
the' hold, cuddled up among the shrimps
and small fish which proved their undo
ing.
The crew, which consisted of six able-

who will swear to a complaint against
each of them this morning before the Jus

Chinese were lodged in the Sausalito jail
last night.

ful.
Grace- Burt and May I-eelle, two young
â¢women whose fondness for the bright side
of life ls well known, are languishing in
the "tanks" of the City Prison with a
charge of. petty larceny hanging over
their pretty heads. They owe their In
carceration to the ungallantry of "Pop
Sullivan, proprietor of the Hoffman cafe,
â¢who temporarily lost an overcoat through
their alleged theft.
A few nights ago Mr. Sullivan enter
tained the ladies named with. bumpers of
â¢wine In a back room of his establishment.
Sad to relate, his guests became Ine
briated, and when he was called to the
telephone by one of his employes they re
paid his hospitality by leaving with his
handsome topcoat. "When he returned and
found his friends gone and his overcoat
missing, he became angry, and hastily tel
ephoned to police headquarters that his
overcoat had been stolen by his visitors.
Detectives Dinan and. Reynolds were de
tailed on the case, and on Wednesday
evening met the culprits down town and
placed them under arrest. Despite their
tears and assertions that they took
"Pop's" coat in lest and had It In their
room on Ellis street, the hard-hearted of
ficers took them to the prison and placed
them on the mysterious small book.
The overcoat was found in the fair pris
oners" room and returned to the still
â wrathful owner. Mr. Sullivan informed
the detectives yesterday that he would
make complaint against the ladies, but up
to last night had not carried out his In
tention. -*
Friends of the prisoners, learning of
their unhappy plight, appealed to Attor
ney Archie Campbell, and ho has Inter
ested himself In the prisoners' case. If
the ladles are not booked to-day for their
alleged crime Mr. Campbell Intends ap
plying for a writ of habeas corpus from
the Superior Court to compel the police to
charge them, so that they can be re
leased on ball. The well-known attorney
ha a often threatened to test the right of
the police to confine people who are under
suspicion, as he claims it Is an unjust
practice and smacks of Siberian methods.

A report was prevalent yesterday ln the

as It has been officially termed in the
statutes, the "Chinese" ostensibly
for the shrimp fishing solely, but in real
ity both for shrimp and small fish, the
latter of which they catch in abundant
quantities and do not return to the water
as the law demands. This ruthless depre
dation on the young fish in the San Fran
cisco and San Pablo bays during the past
few years has resulted in such depletion
of the various species that formerly
stocked these waters that the entire com
munity has become seriously alarmed.
The Legislature has passed laws prohib
iting such fishing, and the Fish Com
missioners have from time to time exhib
ited a desultory activity in suppressing it.
This practice has been constant, and the
reason of It is that the Chinese fishermen
have been practically unmolested by the
authorities, who instead of enforcing- the
law appeared to have winked at its open
violation. In fact it is stated by the
years ago. but resigned in order to accept
the position of manager for the estate of
Mr. O'Connor of O'Connor, Moffat & Co.,
the dry goods merchants. He received a
salary of $22,500 per annum for the three
years in which he acted in that capacity,
and out of an investment of $500,000 turned
in a profit of $216,000 annually to the es
tate. When he severed his connection with
the estate he was reappointed a special
agent.

ANONYMOUS LETTER
SENT TO THE MORGUE
THE AUTHOR SAYS MRS. H. C.
RASMUSSEN WAS POISONED.
Claims Her Husband Murdered Her
in Order That He Might Marry
Another Woman.
A mysterious anonymous letter was re
i ceived by Coroner Hill yesterday morn
! ing advising him to make an Immediate I
j and thorough Investigation as to the I
| cause of the death of Mrs. H. C. Ras
mussen, who died, according to a duly
signed doctor's certificate, of blood I
poisoning, last Tuesday morning at her j
home, 1,844 Union street. 'â â¢ ;-.
The writer avers that the deceased did i
not die as a result of natural causes, but '
was poisoned by her husband, who took
this means of getting rid of her that he
j might marry a Mrs. Dolan, with whom,
it is claimed, he has been keeping com
pany for several months past. In proof
of this the letter states that the day
Mrs. Rasmussen died her husband went
buggy riding with the Dolan woman. This
in fact is true, but Mrs. Dolan did not,
according to her statement, accompany
Rasmussen on a ride of pleasure, but on
one of sorrow. She maintains that the
grief-stricken husband of the deceased
visited her at her home and made a piti
| able request that she accompany him to
an undertaker's ln order to select a
shroud and casket for his wife. She did
so, as she claims, reluctantly, not caring
to have the neighbors get a wrong Im
pression of her mission. After they left
the undertaker's she, according to her
own statement, drove to Cypress Lawn
Cemetery for the purpose of purchasing
a burial plat. The object of the letter, It
is surmised, is an attempt to satisfy the
author's animosity or spite against either
or both the Dolan woman and Rasmussen
by blackening their characters in the
sight of the public. -;â â ':__.Â«
From every Indication Rasmussen was
essentially a home man. From the state
ments of neighbors and friends he had
his affections there and was always actu
ated by the desire to make his home, as
far. as it was in his power to do so. a
happy one. .
The only theory that is advanced in
explanation of the letter Is the unusual
Interest which Mrs. Dolan exhibited of
late for the Rasmussen family ln general.
She had made presents to the children
I and had bought delicacies, etc., for the
i deceased woman during the period of her
Illness. 'â 'â¢*- '...-* â .*.-- *. :."'â¢:
Another passage of the letter states that
I the husband of Mrs. Dolan was forced to
â¢ | leave her some time ago on account of
: ! the attentions which were accepted by her
. ! from Rasmussen. This, however, is de-
I nied. Dolan was compelled to leave his
! wife so the latter said, because he re
j fused to support his children and insisted
1 in enjoying a life of absolute indolence.
1 I Since the separation it is conjectured that
! he shipped as a stowaway aboard of an
' Alaskan steamer. ...
1 Dr. W. Winterburg, who attended the
deceased from the time she was taken
1 sick until she died, scorns the idea that
: death resulted from anything other than
! natural causes. Pie has sumbltted. a
signed certificate of death, which^ls. now
! in the possession of the Coroner. '
Rasmussen emphatically - denied that
i there was any foundation for any of the
i charges made in the anonymous commu
nication. ; .â¢'â -'â¢â â â¢â â¢,'â _-_ .â¢' _â / -, V V\ 'â¢

J. W. MACKAY WAS NOT
GUILTY OF FRAUD
THE FOX SUIT AGAINST HIM
WITHOUT FOUNDATION.
Supreme Court Says the Capitalist
Was Not Responsible for the
Mining Official's Actions.
The case of Theodore Fox against Jonn
W. Mackay and the Consolidated Cali
fornia and Virginia Mining Company was
decided yesterday by the Supreme Court
in favor of the defendants. Fox â¢is a
stockholder In the mining company, and
Mackay was a director in the Nevada
Bank. In the complaint Mackay was ac
cused of conspiracy to defraud the min
ing company, with the aid of Its board of
directors, out of $50,000. The action was
to compel him to replace that sum of
money in the treasury of the company.
The basis of the cause of action was
found in the payment to W. H. Patton,
superintendent of the mine, of. the $50,000.
which was made in four monthly install
ments of $12,500 each. The money was
paid to Patton under a resolution or the
board of directors reciting that it was
done in consideration of the extraordi
nary and valuable services rendered to
the * company in extinguishing a fire
of long standing in the lower levels of
the mine. . . -'--Â* 7: '
In the lower court Mackay won the
case, from which two appeals were taken,
one from the judgment and the other
from the order denying a new trial. Jus
tice Garoutte. who wrote the opinion,
states: "Those findings of fact (of the
lower court) are to the effect that Mackay
committed no fraud; that he was not. a
conspirator; that he was not a member
of the board of directors of the mining
company; that he in no way profited b**
the transaction, and was an entire
stranger to the whole matter from start
to finish. Upon this state of facts a judg
ment of non-liability upon his nart has
ample support and should be affirmed. It
is so ordered." -; /

TWO CAPTAINS AND
THE PILOT CENSURED
LICENSES OF A CAPTAIN AND
PILOT SUSPENDED.
Captain Gustafson of the William D
Severely Reprimanded for the
Recent Collision.
Captains O. F. Bolles and John K.
Bulger, United States local inspectors of
steam vessels, yesterday suspended the
license of Captain Clatrvllle of the ferry
steamer Oakland for three months, and
of Pilot J. H. Douglass of the sain, vessel
for twelve months for running down the
gasoline launch William D on the 22d of
January of this year. Two passengers
on the launch were drowned on that oc
casion.
The inspectors say in their report that
had Douglass signaled to stop and back
when he first saw the launch getting
nearer to the ferry boat be would have
avoided the collision. Captain Clalrvllle
was reprimanded for noâ¬ keeping a proper
lookout on that occasion. "Had he done
so," say the Inspectors, "he could not
have helped seeing the launch, as the
weather was clear?' ._._-- _.'â;.:
Captain Gustafson of the launch was
blamed also for the same reason, but the
fact that the . launch was less than fif
teen tons, and therefore not under the
jurisdiction of the inspectors, saved his
license. "Had Captain Gustafson," say
the inspectors, "been keeping a proper
lookout he would have seen the Oakland
In time to avoid the collision. We there
fore hold him to be as much to blame in
this matter as the pilot of the Oakland
and equally responsible for the collision."
PROFESSOR HAMMON RETIRES.
Forecast Official Willson Temporarily
in Charge of the Weather.
George H. Willson assumed charge of
the local weather bureau in the Mills
building yesterday, vice W. H. Hammon.
who has resigned to take a position in a
Pittsburg gas concern. Mr. Willson has
been in the office since 1890 and has been
temporarily in charge of Weather affairs
several times. He will make way for A.
G. .McAdie of New Orleans-, who has been
here before and has been reassigned to
this station by the Department of Agri
culture.
Mr.<W r illson says that there will probably
be rain ln Northern California to-day, and
it will extend to San Francisco. The con
ditions are such, that he predicts a storm
from the north, and believes that Califor
nia will yet receive a good downpour.
In many places In the State it drizzled
yesterday. The district about Fresno was
dry but cloudy. Between this city and
Santa Clara county very little rain has
fallen.
Another School Suit.

mary School, but who was lately removed
by the new Board of Education, filed an
application in the Superior Court yester
day for a writ of mandate to compel the
board to reinstate her. Upon the filing of
the complaint an alternate writ was is
sued, returnable next week.
MRS. MARY "CULLEN"
HAS TWO HUSBANDS
THE FIRST WAS DIVING WHEN
SHE MARRIED.
Judge Belcher Therefore Decides
Against Her in Her Suit
for Maintenance.
Mrs. Mary "Cullen" Is not the legal wife
of Gerald Cullen. A few days ago an ac
tion instituted by Mrs. Cullen against the
man whom she thought was her husband
for maintenance was tried and submitted.
During the trial it was contended by Cul
len that when he took the marriage vows
with tho plaintiff she had a husband liv
ing In the person of one James Riggs. The
plaintiff denied the allegation and pre
sented a photograph of a ghastly Morgue
subject which she identified as Riggs. the
subject having been buried prior to her
marriage to Cullen. Many witnesses,
however, testified that they had seen
niggs as late as December last, and as
the plaintiff married Cullen, as she
thought four years ago, the marriage was
naturally illegal, for If Riggs was alive
last December he manifestly was four
v Judge Belcher, after giving judgment for
Judge Belcher, after giving judgment for
the defendant, said that the court could
not annul the marriage, as asked by the
defendant, stating that for that purpose
another action would have to be brought.
In all probability this will be done, and
doubtless Cullen will be freed from the
woman who claims to be his wife, but
whom the court has decided to be the
wife of another. Practically she Is not a
wife at all, for no husband will assume
the responsibility of calling her "wife."
