SAGE ADVICE THAT MEETS
WITH A FOUL OUTBURST
The "Colonel" Consigns the Republican
Party to Perdition-Dan Cole Deserts
Grant and Breaks Into the
Candelaria Corral.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS? SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 14.â The railroad scheme
for a Republican caucus is defeated.
The whip of the , corporation was
cracked- vigorously and viciously to
bring the Republican members who are
not supporting the "Colonel" Into the
Candelaria corral; â¢ ../'..-'/ y, J.-r 'â >.
The touts put on an air of proud de
fiance, - boasting that Barnes' men and
Bulla's men would get into the caucus
when Dan snapped his fingers. Herrin
cracked the whip, Dan snapped his
! fingers and the railroad press threat
ened all sorts of political death to the
Republicans : who - should disobey, in
structions. Since Saturday every form
of influence known to â  political cam
paigns except the actual disbursement
of money has been brought to bear to
render the scheme successful, but the
Republican majority in the Legislature
is as resolute to-night as ever. in the
purpose to defeat the caucus proposi
tion. * 'iT -\- 7
The true friends and confidential ad-
visers of Colonel Burns now realize that
he .cannot win. The last y chance of
winning out has . gone glimmering!
There are no more bright and alluring
devices to be sprung. The colonel is up;
against the real thing.now.and for the
first time in his life begins to feel the ;
power of public judgment. He is no;
longer the self-composed, unruffled po
litical manager. When advised to-day
by a high State official to ; withdraw
from the hopeless contest for the sake
of the Republican party, j he : â  became
fiercely indignant and exclaimed: â '}
"To hell with the party." . I â  â¢
Burns cannot be elected Senator. He
must get his coveted vindication
through . the courts or the ballot box.
He cannot get it from this Legislature,
for | the majority of Republicans look
to higher considerations than the grat
ification of personal ambitions. While
the "Colonel" cannot win. he still pos
sesses the power to punish, and' the
way he threatens is calculated to make
the weak and timid fear for results.
y Colonel Burns has written the epi
taph for Senator Bulla's political tomb
stone. The refusal of the Los Angeles
Senator to entertain for an instant the
colonel's demand for a caucus caused
a great outburst of wrath in the camp
of the C&ndelaria candidate. The sig
nal has gone out from the corral that:
Bulla is politically damried for all time
and - that .no consideration must be
shown him. \ The . railroad is to black
list* him and down' him whenever he
raises his head. In short, ; the "Colo
nel has read him out of the Republi
can party, and Herri stands ready to
drive him from the State. â¢*:
Bulla, it seems; had the manliness to
flatly refuse to take orders from the
corporation and to make his refusal so
emphatic that his meaning could not be
misunderstood. . The most vigorous on
slaught to break up Senator Bulla's lit
tle camp may be the next order given.
It is as. true as gospel that Burns? now
full of hatred? is out for revenge. He
will probably remain in the -field : as
long he can inflict punishment on
his- political enemies, and when he re
tires will send his ' forces to the aid. of
' the candidate â¢ least ? objectionable to
him before the Legislature. â¢ :

ers"; probably Induced Dr. Rowell to
await further developments. Senator
Flint may decide to join his voting
companion In the departure from Bard.
Flint is always â  close mouthed about
his own intentions, and his real pur
pose may not be disclosed until he casts
his vote. He is non-committal on the
subject of a caucus and does not ex
press any objection to the deadlock.
Irving M. Scott is again on the scene
of the Senatorial conflict. He arrived
here from San Francisco last evening,
and gave the impression that he was
decidedly friendly to the cause of Gen
eral Barnes. It was believed last night
that he would use his influence to per
suade Senator Davis and Assembly
man Dunlap to vote for Barnes when
he (Scott) reached the conclusion that
he had no chance to win for himself.
After talking with several Bulla men
and listening to the plan for a "tall
end" caucus he changed his mind and
accepted the suggestion that Senator
Davis and Assemblyman Dunlap
should first honor the Los Angeles can
didate with their support and get into
the Barnes camp later on if the pros
pects of the General should take on
the lustre of immediate success. In
the absence of ex- Mayor Ellert, Mr.
Scott has floundered around. He is not
as steady as the Oregon or as speedy
as the Chitose. It is suggested that he
has made a little combine with Sena
tor Bulla to help the Lbs. Angeles can
didate now, and in return for his sup
port at this time secure, four years
hence, the backing of Bulla when a
Senator is to be chosen to succeed Sen
ator Perkins.
Ex-Harbor Commissioner Dan T.
Cole, who now holds a Federal position
in the United States Mint at San Fran
cisco, arrived to-night. He is here this
trip for Burns. Cole introduced Grant
throughout the State. He took Grant' d
money to influence the election of the
legislative ticket in' Grant's favor. He
I gave some of the money to Assembly
man Jilson, who is now voting for
Burns, and kept some for himself to
pay his own expenses. The records of
the - harbor investigation charge this
same Dan Cole with reckless misman
agement of a public trust and practical
ly accuse him of defrauding the State
of a large sum of money in connection
with the construction of the Ferr- De
pot at San Francisco, . He comes here
to tell members of the Legislature that
they should go into a caucus to elect
Dan Burns United States Senator.
The weight that Cole carries can be
imagined, as he is the man who made
to Judge Clough a proposition that the
Plumas Assemblyman indignantly
spurned. When it is called to the pub
lic mind that Cole offered an induce
ment to Judge Clough to vote for
Grant, what must the people think of
the ex-Harbor Commissioner's presence
at this time to induce members of the
Legislature to vote for Burns.
. A swarm of touts arrived from San
Francisco* to-night and all along the
Candelaria line there is talk that the
great show-down is to take place next
Friday. Men who are on the inside
know that it will not happen on .that
day or any other day of this session. -
The minority conference appointed to
meet to-morrow will probably consist
of the Bulla men and two or three
others. The Barnes men have resolved
to stand firm until Grant and Burns
retire from the field. As far as can be
ascertained that is . the resolution
formed- late to-night. â  To-day when
â¢ Grant was invited to enter the Strat
ton-Bulla conference he declined to
â countenance any movement in favor of
Bulla. He said . his men would stay in
the field as long as Burns was a candi
date and then if they decided to leave
him many would prefer General Barnes
to Bulla. 7: .7- .
Ex-Harbor Commissioner ."William H.
Brown arrived from San Francisco to
night. He is hero to look over, the field,
study the situation and. report the re
sults of his observations to W. F. Her
rin of the Southern Pacific. If -Ml*..

"My key to open the deadlock Is one which ought to appeal to all for its

"Have a conference of all those who are not voting for Grant or Burns.
Those thirty members having assembled in conference might first determine
if every one of them would vote for either Bulla, Barnes, Scott, Bard. Estee
or Felton, who are now being voted for. If any one of these candidates would
be satisfactory to every member, then the conference might resolve 'â  itself
into a caucus and decide on which candidate should be the candidate of the
thirty in joint convention. In fairness it should be agreed that all of them
would stay with the candidate selected until the majority (or sixteen) should
say that another shoulu be selected. For instance, suppose Bulla should be
the nominee of the thirty at first; then, if balloting for him in convention by
the thirty would show that he could not draw any of the Grant or Burns
vote*., then the conference might take up Barnes. If Barnes could not draw
from the other votes, the thirty could take up Scott, Bard, Felton and E&
t^p, each in succession. , If none of the candidates now being voted for could
prove a winner -we. could pick out some other candidate^ â¢' .
"This afternoon I saw all the anti-Grant and anti-Burns voters and every

should develop some such plan I believe the deadlock will be broken. If. we
do not succeed by some such plan, then the odium of the situation will be
thrown on Colonel Burns or Mr. Grant, for we will have, demonstrated that.
we aimed at the good of the State and of the Republican party rather than
the selfish ambition of any one candidate." . y* : - yy??-
Out of all this talk is. after all, to come a caucus. Not such a one as .
Mr. Burns of Yolo and Mexico, has well nigh moved the cornerstone of the
Capitol to. accomplish, nor yet such a one as his every ribald tout has given
up his voice to since this unusual campaign opened. It is to be a caucus of
the "tail-enders." the little fellows who .Mr. Grant of San Diego says are .
running through the Senatorial landscape with lightning rods stuck in
their hats, and Its essential feature Is that it is to be utterly anti-Grant and
anti-Burns. It is their elimination, not their election, that the supporters y
of Bulla and Barnes, of Scott and Bard and the rest have 'planned, and
Assemblyman Walter Melick of Los Angeles and Senator Frank Stratton
of Oakland are looming on the political horizon as the possible breakers of
this forty days' deadlock. "-.'â¢?' â¢'â¢ ".. .."?" s;.s*UÂ£ yyy.y- 'â '. :'".â â :â 
The plan, which emanates from Mr. Melick. was considered pro and con
tills morning at a little star chamber meeting hold in room 53. 0f the Capitol.
It was a conference sub rosa and Its deliberations were not intended for the:
cars of others than the eight legislators who made up the party. â¢ They were:
Senator Stratton of Oakland, Senator Davis of Amador. Senator Rowell of 7
Fresno. Senator Simpson of Los Angeles, Senator Currier of Orange, Sena
tor Taylor of Alameda, Senator Gillette of. Humboldt and Assemblyman
Bliss of Alameda.
Senator Stratton has been quietly working up such a conference since?.
Saturday night. Its sole object was to settle upon some plan by which all the
minor factions could reach an agreement. No plan was settled upon by the
original eight, and when they adjourned this morning's meeting it was with
the intention of calling a general conference of all the anti-Grant and anti-
Burns forces for 4 o'clock this afternoon. Although Melick was not present,
It was understood that he approved the proposition and during the better
part of the day he occupied himself with sounding the minority and broaching
the plan of action he proposes. '?,-.' ; ;â¢'.'.'â¢:-' -?"*
; His scheme is so uniquely new that only a practical test will demonstrate
its merit. He proposes first to call a conference of all those who- are voting
for candidates other than Grant and Burns, at which it could be decided
whether there is one man In the field for whom every one of the thirty
would vote. '-Ty?*; '/i'y/: - -,??â¢:';;-
In other words, whether they would all center on either Barnes, Bulla,*
Scott, Bard, Estee or Felton. If it were found that any one of these candi
dates was satisfactory to them all, the conference would resolve itself Into
a caucus and decide that the chosen one be the choice of the thirty In joint
convention. If the selected candidate did not win over enough Grant and
Burns votes ln the opening ballot to assure his election, then a majority of
the caucus would select another of the crowd, and so on until they had all
been given a try-out. The last one falling, another candidate would be
decided upon to swing In at the eleventh hour and either break the dead
lock or let the question of electing a Senator go over to the next session.
. Mr. Melick'B. proposition was as complicated as the Assembly clock, but
It found favor; and by 4 o'clock this afternoon every one of the thirty had
agreed to the proposition In toto, and the conference Would have come off
as advertised but for the fact that the Senate did not adjourn until a much
later hour than the Assembly, and when the representatives from both
houses finally turned up in room 53 there were only fifteen present. There
was a general talk and finally it was decided that the whole matter should
go over until to-morrow afternoon at 5 o'clock. '
â¢ . In the meantime every one: will be notified* to be on hand, and Senator
Stratton has been delegated to do. the rounding up of the clans. He will be
assisted by Melick, who has a list signed by every one of the thirty. '
Those who were, on hand this afternoon were ; Senators Gillette, Flint,
Rowell, Taylor; Stratton, Davis, Currier, Simpson, Morehouse, Luchslnger,
and Assemblymen Valentine, Belshaw, Atherton, Melick and L. A. Miller.'
The alacrity with which they have taken hold of the project Is considered
. here as. deeply significant of the firm resolve. of those who are not voting
for- them that neither Dan M. Burns nor Ulysses 8. Grant shall represent
"this State in- the Senate, no matter how wildly they wield their political club,
or how temptingly: they jingle good campaign gold. '. '"
â¢ Although this plan of Mellck's has been on the carpet since Saturday, there
were 'few outside, the originatorsâ and Strattonâ had been
aware of It. The . understanding . arrived at between these two men, one an
adherent of Bulla, the other of Barnes, has made the scheme more than a
possibility. The plan was at first somewhat modified from its present as
pect. Senator- Stratton, had a plan which was all his own, and he broached It
to General Barnes only a day or so ago. It consisted of a rather risky
loan of General Barnes* strength, and when It came to the ears of his sup
porters they declined to' accede to it. Stratton's plan was to go over to
Bulla and take with him Assemblyman Knowland of ' Alameda, If any
thing < would start , a break; he figured, that would. If Bulla could not gain
more ,votes It would also develop that, and the Los Angeleno would be satis
fied to quit the game "arid reciprocate Barnes' courtesy by resigning - his
strength to him. , It sounded pretty when Stratton explained it, but it was too
much in the line of other glittering dreams that have been floating around
town to suit the rest of -the crowd, and it was declared off. â ;
.-. i'ellck's proposition, has been accepted as the one feasible solution, and

BURNS IN POSSESSION OF
A ROOM IN THE CAPITOL
CALL -. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO", ?Feb: .14.â Among the various
duties and, "responsibilities attached to
the office of Secretary of State is one that
makes the Secretary the custodian of the
rooms in the Capitol building. For many
years room 40 has been used as the pri
vate office of. the adjutant â¢ general of
the National Guard'- of California, but It
is no longer connected with the military
department of the State government. In
stead it is used to a considerable extent
as an apartment where Colonel Burns can
hold private interviews with the Senators
and Assemblymen of the State of Cali
fornia. y -ââ¢: 7 â¢ .-.-. ,
.Yesterday Senator Smith of Kern
County, while occupying his seat in the
.Senate, was told by the Secretary of State
that a gentlman desired to see him in
room 40. Senator Smith went to â¢ the
apartment and found himself face to face
with Daniel M. Burns. "'.;'?"
The "colonel" = did not hesitate to ask
outright for the support of the Senator
from Kern. /â¢y'y'7 ;.-â â¢
The Senator was equally f rank' and out
spoken. He said to. Burns: "My con
stltuents do not â¢ want you for United
States Senator, and I cannot arid will not
support you for that office."
' The fact that Burns was frankly and
directly refused Is not so significant, . as
several rebuffs of the same nature hap
pened, to the "colonel" yesterday, but It
does ' signify a good deal that a room
needed for the public uses should be de
tached from the adjutant general's of
fice and used as the headquarters of a
Senatorial candidate. In olden times the
great railroad manager, Stow, was wont
to ."do" politics In this identical room, and
perhaps some traditions of luck may be
connected with It, At this time sub
jects connected with the welfare of Cali
fornia soldiers at the front. and National
Guardsmen at home might suggest that
the adjutant general should have more
than one s room for the demands of the
public service, but that consideration
counts for nothing when the convenience
of Dan Burns is involved.

BILL TO EXTERMINATE
LIGHTING COMPANIES
CALL . HEADQUARTERS, . SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 14.â Cinch bills, like many,
other things. found around a Legislature,
will. not down. They can,: however, be
withdrawn,, and one that found its way
into the Assembly this morning will meet,
with that alternative , to-morrow as soon
: as Radcliff. 'who Introduced It, can get
1 the attention 'of the Speaker. The bill
jls aimed, at. the electric lighting com
. j panics, but it is said that its particular-
I object of attack is the Blue Canyon cor-,
I poratlon that has. a scheme on foot: to
: furnish light to the residents of San
| Francisco
j There is no finesse displayed in the con-
I struction of the measure. It comes out
i brutally, and: arbitrarily establishes a fixed
rate bri each electric light used, which,
! if the bill were allowed to become oper
! ative, would close down every 1 power plant,
' furnishing power or light to any. city of.
over 50,000 population.
It provides that, no electric light com
pany or corporation shall charge a rate
of over 5 cents a month for each sixteen
candle power lamp. For lamps that burn
over sixteen candle power no more may
be charged unless a full sixteen â¢ candle
power additional is used, when 5 cents
more may be charged.
For lamps that burn under sixteen can
dle power the rate is only 2 cents a month
each. The bill is also designed to attract
the attention of the gas companies. In
another section it provides that no: cor
poration shall place in any building any
meter or gauge for determining the
amount of fluid used therein for lighting
purposes, nor shall they sell to one per
son light at a cheaper rate than to an
other. Any corporation or company vio
lating the provisions of the act shall.be
liable to the aggrieved person for dam
ages In the sum of $250; costs and attor
ney fee of $50. .y-y.>- .
The bill' was Introduced by Mr. Rad
cliff upon the request- of San Francisco
parties, who assured him that it was.
a perfectly proper measure. As soon as
; he took time to look Into It he discov
-1 ered its more than questionable intent
j and announced that to-morrow he "would
ask permission to withdraw It.

young Mr. Works in the Assembly pro
viding for the protection of people afraid

â¢ Young Mr. Works' bill provides for the

catures of any one and, taking a step fur
ther, he wishes to. knock out newspaper

ing a specially keen and heavy ax wait
ing for its appearance on the file. When

to do the bill Justice at the moment, a
condition unusual for him, so he moved
that the bill go over until Thursday,
when he wanted It made a special order

BURNS' MAN HOCHHEIMER
WILL NOT BE SENATOR
.CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 14.â The Republican "or
ganization" which Is represented in Sac
ramento by Major McLaughlin and some
Others of the' Burns workers has received
notification that H. A. HochheiriiCr Is not
to be the Republican nominee for State
Senator at the special election called, for
the purpose of filling the vacancy caused.
,by the death of the late Senator Boggs
of Colusa. To put It in the language of
the "push" Hochheimer has been "turned
down,", a proceeding that will not be re
ceived as good news by the Burns touts,
because Hochheimer was programmed for
the place and the special election was
called for his especial benefit.
During his recent visit to Sacramento
to "square" himself with the "organiza
tion" and secure the calling of the special
election he was hailed by the touts as one
of themselves, and was given the title of
"Senator" in anticipation of the honor It
was confidently expected would be his.
According' to the news that has reached
Sacramento, the Republicans of the
Eighth Senatorial District do not take
kindly to Mr. Hochheimer, mainly for the
reason that he was known to be working
in the Interest of Burns' Senatorial candi
dacy, and as a consequence they " deter
mined to nominate some man who would
stand some show of being elected against
the .- Democratic candidate, James W.
Goad. The man they have selected, for
the honor is said to be E. W. Jones, ex-
Sherlff of Colusa County.'
It Is more than probable that the people
of the district will, insist on knowing if
Jones Is favorable to Burns before they
will consent to cast their votes for him.

LEGISLATORS WHO
BOLDLY DEFY THE
RAILROAD THREATS
More Members Go on Record in
'/'..y Opposition to the Caucus ?â ??;
Proposition.
Dan Burns and His Allies Witness the Defeat
of Their Latest Scheme to Steal
the Senatorship.
CALL HEADQUARTERS,, I SACRA
MENTO, . Feb. 11â Dan Burns and; the
railroad, having made an attempt. to force
the legislators into a Senatorial caucus for
the benefit of the Mexican, are now forced
to stand by and be witnesses to their Own
impotency.. Not only have a majority of
the legislators refused to obey the orders
of the corporation and the corporations
candidate, ? but they are Soy little intimi
dated by the threats that have been made
that they now come out openly and are
putting themselves on record as being op
posed to the Burns scheme for a caucus.
Some of the members of the Legislature
who have been interviewed on the subject
feel a natural delicacy about expressing
themselves in set terms regarding the
scheme Burns has attempted to work in
order to get them in a position where he
may force them to cast their votes for
him.. : These members refrain from men
tioning Burns', name In connection with
their .expressed opposition to a. caucus,
but they make their "meaning clear by
saying they will never consent to a cau
cus as long as present conditions exist.
By "present conditions", is. meant Burns'
presence, in "he field as a Senatorial can
didate.7 â¢.'?'.>.'â¢?.'?â¢- Y'7/y'-/: '/.y/s-yi-:./;''
These legislators, as well as those who
Openly denounce Burns, appreciate the
fact that the great majority of the people
of the State are of the belief that the
election of Burns, to the United States
Senate would be a public calamity.
Knowing this to be true, they take the
position that it is their duty to oppose by
every means within their . power every
scheme that is set on foot by the railroad
company, and by interested individuals to
bring about Burns' election..
Realizing that the effort of the railroad
company to force a caucus is a. move
purely in the interest , of Burns' candi
dacy, the honest members of ; the. Legis
lature are opposing it and are making no
secret of their opposition.
Yesterday The Call published Interviews

posed to a caucus. Many others who are

Senatorial problem. By the general con-'
sensus of opinion in the southern-part of
the State (and I believe the same opinion
is strong in other sections) the election of
Mr. Burns would react unfavorably on ..-..'
the Republican party. . The ascertained
facts with regard to the financial part of j
Mr.' Grant's campaign are such that his.,

his bill was in no way a "cinch" measure.

Cornelius Sullivan, representing the com

lengthy discourse upon the benefits both
the rich and poor would derive from the
passage of the bill, and he also showed
âthough not intentionallyâ that his own
company would also be infinitely bene

great delight in being as antagonistic as
possible to the measure, inasmuch as he
thought It would directly benefit Sullivan,

PRIMARY ELECTION LAW
PASSES THE ASSEMBLY
; CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Feb. Routine matters in the
Assembly to-< ay made the proceedings as
dull as is tie dally joint ballot. There
was- scarce "a- quorum half the time and
some of the time there was no quorum at
all. The fenate file was made the order
of 'the 1 ' dry. and .Curtln's Senate bill 5"
was mad* the one measure over which to
have the daily scrap. â â  This measure raises
the sauries, of San Francisco's Superior
Judges from $4000 to. $5000 per annum, and
it. also carried an Increase of from $3000 to
$4000 li the 1 salaries of the Superior Judges
of Tuolumne and Shasta Counties. The
minority and Assemblyman Brown of SanMateo made a hard fight against its pas- I
sage on the ground of economy, and as: it
turned out their fight was a winning one.
Assemblyman Dibble, who was fathering
the measure through its Assembly career,
made the mistake of not having it passed
on file until a time when there were more
of the majority on hand to back him up,
and when It came to a vote it was lost.
He ordered a call of the House, but it
was of no avail.
Assemblyman Camlnetti of the minority
voted for the bill, and when It was de
feated changed his vote from aye to no
and gave notice that to-morrow he would
move to reconsider.
Senator Taylor's Senate bill 31 was with
drawn, as a duplicate Introduced In the
Assembly by Knowland of Alameda has
already passed both houses. The bill pro
vides a course of procedure by which
rltles may annex uninhabited strips of
territory lying adjacent to them.
Senator Stratton' primary election law
came up and was passed without much In
the way of opposition. "...
Senate bill 66, by Smith, was also al
lowed to become a law. Senate bill 30,
by Stratton, providing for the election of
delegates to nominating conventions, was
passed on the file. His Senate bill S3, re
lating to the nomination of candidates to
public office, was also passed. â¢ Smith's
Senate bill 82. authorizing, the State
Treasurer to furnish his office, was
passed after some I ate. 'Morehouse's

A MENACING BLAZE.
A fire which threatened destruction to
much property broke out in the block of
one .story, buildings on Market street, be
tween Twelfth and Brady, owned by the
Hobart estate, about half-past 11 o'clock
last evening. The blaze originated in the
rear of. Shaw's blacksmith shop where
about 400 tons of alfalfa hay belonging to
a party named Brandenstein was stored.
In a sh6rt time the entire hay stack was
raking flames into the air and the black
smith shop was ablaze. The fire spread
to. two unoccupied dwelllng-.houses, but
was got under control by the Fire Depart
ment, which lost ho time in getting to the
scene. Had the fire gained a little more
headway' the entire block would have
â¢been doomed to destruction as the houses
â¢are frame structures and are close to

KELLOGG'S SUCCESSOR
STILL REMAINS UNNAMED
The Board of Regents of the State Uni
versity met in regular session at the Hop
kins Institute of Art at 1 o'clock yester
day afternoon. Regents Kellogg. Den
lcke, Phelan. 7 Houghton Miller, John E.
Budd, Hallidie, Kirk. Foote, Slack. Rein- ,
stein and Phelps . were present. In the
absence of Governor Gage. Regent Tim- j
othv G. Phelps was called to the chair.
Superintendent of Publle Instruction Kirk
for the first time since his Incumbency
in office was presented/ to the board. ...
The report of the president of the uni
versity was first read and /accepted, after j
which the board accepted the resignation
of A. L. . Lengf eld, professor Jof materia j
medica and medical chemistry.?: The.com
mittee on agricultural experiments in its
report embodied a recommendation that
a reduction be made in the number of i
outside experimental stations and =' that |
the Flood mansion at Mehlp Park be uti- j
lized as the central station. The recom- j
mendation was. concurred in.
Shortly after 2 o'clock the. board went
Into executive, session and sat for an
hour. When the doors were again thrown
open the subject of plans and specifica
tions presented, by Corlett . & McCaw, |
architects, for the proposed Wilmerding :
School of Mechanics 'were submitted. The ;
cost of a temporary building would ap- ;
proximate J2.,000, of which. s9uoo. would be j
expended in the/construction of a. founda- j
tion. The architect stated- that $5000 ad- j
ditional- would construct a temporary
structure of brick, but as. it was the In
tention of the board to permit the erec- j
tion of a temporary structure costing in i
the neighborhood of $15,000 and permit the â¢
students to erect a permanent one when
they had become sufficiently versed, in I
the"art of handling tools, some discussion
arose as to the acceptance of the archi
tects' plans In their present condition. {
Some of the members thought the amount ;
was too large to expand on the temporary j
structure, but It was argued on the other j
hand that the building would: be set back |
oh the lot and could be used for store
rooms and would in no manner Interfere
with a monumental structure.
A question then arose as to a fire wall
to divide the building. The matter was
finally disposed of by referring it back
to the committee (composed 'of Regents
Schwartz. Phelan and Denickel. with the
request that the report be resubmitted -j
at a special meeting to be held on Feb- j
ruary 2S. -
A communication was read from Gov- :
ernor Gage, requesting that the selection
of a president to succeed Kellogg be de- ;
ferred until after the close of the legis- ;
lative session. The board. took action ac- j
cordingly. â â ' . â ?."''â -'â¢ .'

SAN JOSE, Feb. : 14.â A1l the available : j

tied Up with liens and just how the
banker Intends to pay the assessment. of
$10 a share, on. each of his 525 shares, of.
stock is a question depositors are asking
each other. Ever since the failure 7he
: has reiterated his desire to- deed all his
property to the. bank for the benefit of
the creditors, but no effort was made to
do so until yesterday, and It looks as
though it was resorted to then only to de
â  feat other creditors. Yesterday Attorney
: F. B. Hambly. for FJacro Fisher, ob
tained Judgment aeair.st Ward Wright
: for $2257 20. This judgment was origi
i nally given in the suit of Fisher against
\ 1). M. Murphy. Wright was on ' Mu
rphy's? bond in the attachment for $2000.
It was never settled, however, and Fishei
came back on Wright for satisfaction.
Judgment was obtained at 11:30 o'clock
,in the forenoon. At 4 o'clock in the after
i noon Wright deeded eighty-two acres of
j land hear Wrights station. In the Santa
Cruz mountains, to the Union Savings
; bank. - A few minutes later Attorney
' Hambly filed an execution against this
: piece of property and steps will be taken
â  at once to have the place sold to satisfy
j the Hen. The deed will not hold, as
: Judgment was obtained before the deed
was given. : ,7.7:
A few days ago Wright's residence on
North First street was attached on an
action in Tulare County to secure pay
ment of a note for $4000. This ties up
all his property; . and it is not plain to

realize $5250 to meet his . assessment.
' Wright, will not be the Only stockholder
who will fall to make good his : share "of
the indebtedness. ' During the past few
days . many of the stockholders have filed
homesteads or deeded away their places. :

Special Dispatch to The CalL
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, Feb. : 14.â
One of the most desperate and exciting
encounters in the history of the prison
took: place Sunday mornings when
Guard S. L. Randolph nearly lost his
life at the hands of an infuriated con
vict named : Luis Rivas. Rivas was
clubbed into insensibility and Warden.
Hale had to station extra guards all
over the yard in order. to keep the other
prisoners from becoming unruly. . â¢ .
-. Rivas is : a negro: who is serving a
life sentence for a burglary committed
in Los Angeles. He is of â¢ herculean
proportions and has ; caused serious
trouble on many occasions because of
his savage, intractable nature.
On Sunday morning a line was
formed,, in charge of Guard Randolph,
to march the convicts into the prison
chapel Rivas .was out of his regular
position, and, when told to get into his.
right place, replied with an . oath. ..The
guard took hold, of .'him and received a
blow between, the ' eyes that knocked
him down : and partially stunned him.
He pluckily returned to the. fray, how
ever, and clubbed the African : into sub
mission, â¢â¢Â©,-â¢
Taking the prisoner by the arm, Ran
dolph started for the dungeon. . j They
had hardly taken a dozen steps when
Rivas closed with the guard, and a
fierce struggle ensued.. Randolph is a
strong man; but little by little the ne
gro forced him . to i the . ground, and,
frothing at the mouth in his rage, tried
to choke Randolph. The other convicts
stood calmly by : and offered no assist
ance.
At- this critical juncture Captain -of
the Yard -Edgar caught sight â¢ of the
negro with his knee on his victim's
Chest. Yelling for assistance, he ran
toward the murderous convict- }. â 
Guard Henry. Moller was first to -the
scene and at Captain Edgars excited
command to hit Rivas he struck the
negro twice on the head with a cane
and knocked him senseless. Rivas was
then taken to the hospital and revived,
and afterward was placed in the dun
geon. â¢ '?',-yyy â¢ ...
Randolph," with the exception of a few
minor cuts about the face, is none the
worse for his encounter.

PASTOR CRABB
SAYS HIS WIFE
WAS A SCOLD
SAN JOSE, Feb.. 14.â divorce trial
in recent years has caused such wide
spread interest as that which is now
being -heard before Judge - Kittredge.
Seldom, if ever, has the spectacle of a
minister of the gospel weeping while on
the witness stand been presented to the
residents of the Garden City or else
where. Yet this occurred to-day dur
ing the taking of evidence in the case
of the Rev. W. D. Crabb of the Meth
odist Episcopal church against his wife,
Hattie A. Crabb. Dr.. Crabb is the di
vine who is charged by his wife with
having indited- and dedicated burning
effusions to a choir girl, and to-day her
name and the names of other Dromi
. nent women were uttered from the lips
of the plaintiff in a divorce Suit which
promises to equal in sensations any
that already have been tried in this
county. ' ââ¢ '** " *' ,/*,
Carrie Perry is the sweet singer's
name, and she -resides in Gilroy. where
Dr. Crabb once ministered to the wants
of a large - flock. Her- name was fre
quently repeated to-day. First. J. C. ;
Zuck,. a well-known real estate dealer
and a prominent member" of the Meth
odist church of Gilroy, in testifying in
behalf of the minister, mentioned it.
and the secret of the name .of the
woman: to whom the doctor addressed
his sonnets was out. Again the name
was given prominence by D. W. Bur
chard, attorney for the plaintiff, in
reading a letter from Mrs. Crabb to her
husband, in which she threatened to
sue Miss Perry for alienating heF hus
band's affections. The doctor took un
the echo and the name of the sonerstress
was bandied back and forth by the
counsel and the sanctimonious witness. ;
Spicy testimony occupied the atten
tion of the court and the spectators, the
latter mostly women, until 5 o'clock, j
Mrs. Crabb sat between her counsel. M.
C. "Hassett and Walter J. Thompson of
San Francisco, and Mrs. H. A. McCor- ;
mack, through whose efforts she was.
released from an insane asylum. Dur
ing the proceedings she intently studied j
her husband's face. She is a frail lit- .
tle woman and shows signs of sleep- i
less nights and great suffering. Lov- ;
ing the man who would rid himself of
her, she denies his right to a separation.
Although in her Jealous moments she
has accused him of much, she evident- j
ly loves him to distraction. ". ..
Rev. Mr. Crabb took the witness stand
this afternoon and treated all present !
tp a salacious recital. In narrative j
form his testimony- was as follows:
I am the Rev. W. D. Crabb. a member
of the Methodist Episcopal church. I was
appointed to the office of elder by a con
ference sometime in 1883. My present pas
torate is on Fifteenth avenue, South San
Francisco. Eight years ago I came to
this county to reside.
. Shortly after I was appointed principal
of the University of the Pacific I noticed
my wife was inclined. to criticize the lady
teachers, and. I had not been in my posi
tion a year when she began to interfere.

would call me. the vilest kind of- names: '
She manifested an 111 wiT! to these ladles

day after prayer meeting a lady shook
hands with me in parting and Mrs. Crabb
came close to me and hissed 'You nasty

AMATEUR BURGLARS
MAKE A POOR SHOWING
WOODLAND, Feb. 14.â Burglars entered
the offlce of the Sierra Lumber Company
last night and made an unsuccessful at
tempt to open the big office safe. En
trance was effected by prying open a rear
window, a shovel being used for that pur
pose. The burglars were evidently ama
teurs, and their Ignorance of the usual
methods employed to open a safe is amaz
ing. They first knocked off tbe ornaments
on the hinges, probably expecting that the
big door would then fall away of its own
weight. They next broke off the knobs
and took off the combination dials of th*
outside door. There Is no evidence that
any attempt was made to drill through
the door or blow up the combination, and
the burglars evidently gave up the job
after removing the outside dials.
After leaving the Sierra Lumber Com
pany's office the burglars made an unsuc
cessful attempt to effect an entrance to
the West Valley Lumber office. . They
tried to force the rear door and window,
but failed. Mr. . Lyf ord picked up near
the window a hatchet which belongs to
the Sierra Lumber Company. Â»â¢

WM. T. B. .NDIN, -
One of the hest known men in Mitchell
County is rejoicing .In the fact that after suf-
fering thirty-three years with a dangerous rup-
ture was finally cured by the system invented
by Dr. XV. S.- Rice. Adams. X. Y. Mr. Blandin
is never so happy as when relating the story of
his cure. For the greater part of his life he
was -laid up In bed: his rupture being so large
that he could not find a truss to hold it until
he learned of the Dr. Rice method. Mr.- Blan-
din . tells of a - near- neighbor of his who was
also ruptured and for whom Mr. Blandin sent
for the Rice treatment. The day It arrived
this neighbor was suddenly stricken with a
strangulated hernia; two doctors and a halt
. dozen men - held him down, the pain being so
Intense that he was out of his mind. Mr." Blan-
din arrived on the scene â  Just in" the nick of
time, and -a few minutes after the patient had
revived from a powerful dose of chloroform, the
Rice system was put on, they had him up and
dressed and he walked out to his barn. The
circumstances of these two cures attracted wide
attention throughout the State. Dr. Rice has
recently prepared a book, giving a full descrip-
tion of his method. It is a home cure at a
very small cost,- and best of all it cures without
pain, danger, detention 0 from work or incon-
venience of any kind. Readers should send for
this book and mail it to any one they know to
be ruptured. * Such an act of _,ndn"s_ will be
worth a great deal- *oÂ° those who suffer from

WASHINGTON, Feb. 14â unani- j
mous consent agreement reached by the j
Senate last Saturday to vote this after
noon on the resolution of McEnery, de- \
claring the policy of this Government |
In the Philippines, was not vacated. In I
accordance with that agreement the
vote was taken on the resolution at 2:30 j
to-day and it was adoptedâ to 22. It |
was noticeable that several Democrats !
who 'were? present and . not paired re- '
framed from voting.? An amendment of
fered by Bacon (D. ) .of Georgia several j
days ago was defeated. The vote on
the amendment was a tieâ 29 to 29â and
Vice President Hobart cast the deciding
vote against the proposition. The vot
ing was preceded .by three hours and a
half of debate. 7 .? .--.- : "< y'77 : y 'â :â â¢?."'
Stewart first took the floor to speak
in opposition. He expressed the. opinion
that whatever the United States might
do it would not ? follow-; ..-policy indi
cated by, the resolution, This country
was under no obligation toy go to. the. j
expense of establishing a government
for the islands; the United States was !
not in the? business of capturing couny j
tries, educating their people and' then â ;
selling them?? On the contrary, '; he.
thought, we . should : hold? the Philippines, j
and thus render the. United States in- j
dependent of other countries: in the pro- j'.
auction of tropical. products which must :
otherwise be a source of great expense. I
Lindsay also expressed the opinion
that the time was inauspicious for the
adoption of any. resolution bearing upon,
the subject of tilt- government of the â¢
Philippines.; but said that if any ex- .
pression was to be given it should be :
clear and distinct and unmistakable in j
terms. Lindsay offered a substitute re- f
citing that, the acquisition of territory
carried -with it no constitutional obliga
tion to admit it to the Union. as Slates.
Lindsay gave notice that he would ask
the Senate to vote, upon his resolution
as soon as' the Senate had voted on the
McEnery resolution.
Bacon then addressed the Senate In
opposition to the McEnery resolution. i
He declared that it was a vicious and i
unfortunate declaration. . â â¢ 7He main- â 
tamed that the/resolution meant noth
ing favorable to the Filipinos; It did
not look to the future freedom arid.self
government of the Filipinos. 7 He re
garded it as simply a declaration that
while the Filipinos were subjects of this
country they could never become citi
zens of the United States.
Hoar was ; opposed to the McEnery :
resolution because? he maintained, it :
gave ho hope of -freedom or liberty or
self-government to the inhabitants of j
the Philippines and 'because it provided
that they should never have a part. Iri
their own government or become a part,
of the United States. It was, he- held,
an infamous declaration â a declaration
simply that the Louisiana sugar plant
ers should. never be afraid of the com- ,
petition, of the Philippine Islands', To
the Filipinos the McEnery resolution
would be a message of tyranny, of hate,
of oppression and of slaughter. Hoar i
adverted to the references In speeches I
to Aguinaldo as an "unprincipled ad* j
venturer," and then entered upon a de- â 
fense of the Filipino leader. He spoke j
of Aguinaldo's appeal to the people of
the United States as so remarkable as
capable of being drafted by- "not ten
men on this planet." .7 y '-'Ty : "-V
"I do not? see," said .Hoar, with
feeling, '?how any American heart nbt .

It has become a gigantic event. . The

"The next big news to be ca
bled from Manila," â¢ said a gentle
man whom your correspondent has
reason to believe Is so close to
the President that he 'is in a
position to get inside infoifcnatlon, "will
be the fall of Malolos and the capture j
of Aguinaldo, if the plane of the ad
ministration don't miscarry. It would
not surprise me if . that news would
reach us before the last of the week.
"The President was simply awaiting
the fall of Iloilo before putting into
effect plans for the effectual suppres
sion of the Filipino rebellion, which
were decided upon some days ago, but
which could not be attempted until it
was seen what resistance General Mil
ler would find when he landed his
forces on the island of Panay. That
he found so little has greatly pleased
the President and his advisers, who
see in it evidence that the natives have
not lost the lesson learned in the strug
gle at Manila. Malolos is the next
move. I have reason to believe General
Otis has already marched his men
against the place, and I confidently
expect to hear of its fall within the
next three or four days. It is of su
preme importance that Aguinaldo be I
made prisoner, and to be sure .of his
capture it is possible the attack may
be delayed a few hours.

said that force would not be used to
compel Dr. Raffel to appear, but that
the German Consul could keep him in

at: the State ' Department this after-. I
noon, was unable to furnish the depart
ment with any information respecting
the. purpose of â¢ his Government with
reference to Herr Rose, the . German
Consul to Samoa, for the reason that
Berlin had not yet received full, reports;
of events which have occurred,, which
it desires before taking action
Much gratification is. naturally felt
at the withdrawal of Herr Raffel. It is
the first step taken by the Berlin Gov
ernment in compliance with the repre
sentations made by Embassador White.
Acting under instructions from â â *.*the
. State Department the American Em
bassador recently brought to the atten
tion of the German Minister of Foreign
Affairs the acts of this official and Herr
Rose,, which this Government contends
are In violation of the treaty of Berlin,
and urged their removal as promptly
as possible. At the time the represen
tations were -made the German repre
sentative explained that his Govern
ment was waiting for full reports and
When these were, received proper action
. Would be taken, should it be shown that
the course pursued by the German of
ficials ..was as .represented by ' the
American advices. In the meantime the.
German Government desired it to be
understood that it had not given any
instructions' which would require any
violation of the treaty.
. Following this disavowal conies news
of the withdrawal of Herr Raffel and
the authorities have no doubt , that
when 7 the German Government fully
understands the facts Herr Rose will
â  also be ordered from Samoa. Where
Germany has made so many conces- j
sions it Is not surprising that the offi
cials are 'quite ready to meet her in a

reason will carefully examine the re

anxious that; he should be appointed to
i office, notwithstanding the decision of
the Chief Justice in favor .of Malietoa?
and the administration Is quite- willing
to closely examine . the decision? and.
should it be, weak in any respect, to
take such action as would seem proper.
Some of the points in the decision of
the Chief Justice have been communi
cated to the-State Department? but the
President and Secretary Hay desire to
learn the full details; before acting.
Should it be shown that the placing of
Mataafa on the throne would be in the
interest of peace- and order 71n the Isl

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb, 14.
President Jordan delivered a lecture to
night on the question of the Philip
pines. Opening' his address he said:?;
â¢ I Wish to-night to maintain a single
proposition.- It is our plain duty to with
draw fro iri the Philippine Islands as soon
as in dignity we can. I ask you to con
sider with me three questions of the hour: y
Why. do we: want the Philippines? What y
can we do with them? What will they
do-- to us? : â â : ";y : -Y::y:y'yy::.yy. â â 'â â ;:;â ;-.â¢
. These questions demand . serious con
siderationânot one at a time, but all to
gether. We should know clearly our final
intentions as a nation, for it is never easy
to retrace false steps.. We have made too
many of these already;. It Is time for us
to grow serious. Even the most headlong,
of our people admit that we stand In the
presence of a real : crisis. : But the prob
lem is virtually . solved when - we Know
what our true interests are- â  Half tne
energy we have â â¢ Spent . in getting Into
trouble will take us honorably out of it.
Once convinced that we do riot want the
Philippines, it Will-be easy to? abandon
therii. : The difficulty - Is that we do . not
yet know what we want, and we . are
afraid that if we once let these people go
we will never catch them again.
Summing up .his discourse he said:
.As to the: true American policy of to-.
day I give the fullest Indorsement: to the
words of Professor James, which are in
substance as follows: - ,Â°
Firstâ lt is our duty to carry out t-he
solemn pledge made to. the world with
respect to Cuba "and retain military pos
session only, long enough to. enable the
Cubans to organize a Government' of their
own. A few months at most should wit
ness the complete relinquishment of Cuba
into the hands of its own citizens. After
that it should remain absolutely free and
independent. We have no. right to insist
that our own or any particular: form of
government shall be. .adopted; by the
Cubans or to Impose qualifications of cit
izenship on them. : Trie present. noble Gov
ernment of Mexico, by which : in Diaz's
own words It has become the "germ of a
great nation," Would have been Impossi
ble under, our own dictation or under, the
disastrous, imperialism of 'Napoleon and
Maximilian. . The same rule should be
adopted In regard to Porto Rico.
Secondâ No Inhabited country should be j
acquired' by this Government .which can- i
not be self-governing and ultimate
ly be received into the family of States.
If in the future the people of Cuba and
Porto Rico agree With those of the United:
States that annexation is mutually desir
able â  they 'may be joined to. - our body
politic. .7, .
Our policy in the Philippines should be
exactly the same. Let them fit their gov
ernment to their own needs, -with the
guarantee of our protection from outside :
Interference. But under no circumstances j
should the Philippines or any distant ter- ,
ritory Inhabited by an - alien and. semi- |'â 
civilized population be retained as a per-
manent possession of the United States.
The greatness of a nation lies not in Its 7
bigness, but in Its justice, In the wisdom .
and virtue of Its people and In the pros- '
perity of their â â â  Individual affairs. The '
nation exists for Its men, never the men !
for the nation. ?y .<,'-'.;. i
"I cannot help thinking of you as you
deserve," said Thoreau, "O, ye Govern
ments." The only Government that I rec
ognizeâand It matters not how few are at ;
the head of It or how small Is Its army-
Is that which â  establishes justice ; in the i â 
land, never that which establishes In
justice. The will of free men to be just | ,
toward one another Is our final guarantee 7
that "government of the people, for the !
people, by the people shall .not perish from ! :
the earth." â : - â  â -:,â . j I '

waterways commissions," Hepburn of
fered as an amendment the Nicaragua
canal bill reported by his committee.
Cannon, chairman of the Appropria
tions Committee, immediately raised
four distinct points of order against it;
first, that It w-as not germane; second,
that it was directly obnoxious to rule
21; third, that it violated the rule re
quiring that appropriations in general
appropriation bills should be authorized
by law, and fourth, that it was not la
continuation of work authorized by law.
â¢ Tbis opened a long parliamentary de
bate upon the' points of order. Hepburn
took the floor, arguing that the amend
ment was germane and that it violated
no rule. He contended that the two
surveys made under the direction of
Congress constructively authorized the
-work of building the canal itself. Ha
insisted that the work of constructing
the canal was in progress within the
contemplation of the rule.
W. A. Smith <R.) of Michigan de
clared that the Dickinson treaty of 1867
warranted an appropriation for the
construction of the canal as much as
the treaty rf Paris warranted the ap
propriation of ;J0,000,000 carried in this
bill.
In concluding his argument Hepburn,
declared that the rale invoked against
his bill was obsolete so. far as the Ap
propriations Committee was concerned.
There were thirteen distinct violations
o-f it in the pending bill. It was in
voked only when the Appropriations
Committee desired to stand off some
fancied raid upon the treasury. There
was a round of applause when Hepburn
took his seat.
Cannon, in reply, said that he would
not consider the wisdom of building the
canal. It was the law which should bÂ©
considered; and there was not a micro
scope in the universe big enough to find
a shred of law upon which to base thla
appropriation. Personally, he an
nounced himself in favor of the con
struction of the canal.
Bailey suggested that if there were a
question as to whether the amendment
were in order upon the bill the House
should agree by unanimous consent to
make the canal bill a special order im
mediately after the disposal of the sun
dry civil bill.
Cahnon. pointed out in response how
a majority of the House, if so disposed,
could to-morrow go into committee of
the whole and consider the canal bill
on its merits. The attempt to get a
rider upon a supply bill that must pass,
he declared, led to bad and sometimes
fraudulent legislation â often both. Can
non was exceedingly earnest anil vigor
ous in his appeal to members not to be
carried off their feet. Impressively he
recalled the scandals in connection with
the building of the Pacific railroads
and pleaded with the House not to dis
honor itself by crushing down a rule
that had stood for 110 years as a safe
guard to legislation. There were some
things that could not be done with im
punity.
There were several interesting col
loquies between Cannon and Hepburn
as they fenced for advantage. With
out concluding the debate upon tha
point of order the committee arose.
The army appropriation bill was re
ported by Hull, who gave notice that
he would cail it up at the earliest op
portunity..
At 5:15 p. m. the House adjourned.EVERY SECTION OF THE STATE STRONGLY
IN FAVOR OF THE GREAT EXPOSITION
IF the wishes of the people of the State of California
are to be considered in the matter of holding a
world's fair in San Francisco in 1901, that enterprise
may he considered as good as an accomplished fact.
From all sections of the State, in response to tele
grams of inquiry sent out by The Call, come expressions
from the most prominent public men of hearty indorsement,
and promises of enthusiastic support of the project. One or
two discordant notes may be found in the grand harmony
of enterprise, progress, energy and intelligence that comes
from the interior, but they are virtually drowned in the
chorus of towns which see the advantages of the proposed
Pacific Ocean and International Exposition of 1901.
To-night there is to; be a special .'â¢ meet- I
ing of the Ways and Means Committee of
the Assembly at Sacramento to act
upon the bills already Introduced, in the j
Legislature in the Interest of the big fair.
On behalf of the general committee of i
the Pacific Ocean Exposition there will i
appear before the Assembly committee to J
speak for favorable action Upon these j
measures Mayor Phelan, J. B. Reinstein,
Charles L. Pat tori. Supervisor John Lack
mann. H. J. Crocker and J. A. Fllcher.
The gentlemen named, accompanied by
Secretary R. P. Doolan.y 7 will .leave for.
Sacramento on 7 the 8 o'clock train this
morning. They will go fortified with facts j
and figures regarding the proposition, arid j
anticipate? little. or no opposition. There i
are two bills to be. considered. ? One ap- i
propriates $500,000 of the State's money
for the exposition, and provides for the i
appointment by the Governor of fifteen ,
commissioners to look after the expendi- !
ture of the amount. The other gives au- |
thority to the counties, cities and coun- |
ties, and municipalities, to ? appropriate j
moneys in aid of the enterprise.
. .: W. 11. Mills, one, of the members :of the ;
general committee. of the exposition has |
given considerable thought to 7 the fair, of
1901. His views are clear and strong. He
brings but prominently the immediate ad
vantages to be derived from the fair, and
also Its importance to the future of San
Francisco and the State of California,
Speaking of the matter yesterday he said:
"I am in favor of holding a meeting of

ADVOCATES THE EXPOSITION AND
A STATE APPROPRIATION FOR IT
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 14.â William Land, Mayor of Sacramento, said to-night
that he favored the holding of the proposed exposition in San Francisco in 1901.
He thinks that it would attract thousands of strangers to this State, many of
whom would undoubtedly conclude to locate here. "Besides," said Mayor
Land, "it would be invaluable as a means of showing the progress made along
industrial and agricultural lines by the State." Mayor Land added that he would
favor a legislative appropriation in aid of the fair, so long as it was reasonable
in amount.

would have an opportunity to give ex-'

"Lord Beresforu has declared that ,-he
is glad that the United States has assert
ed its ownership of the Pacific Ocean.
That is a most significant statement. We
acquired the Pacific Coast territory upon
the theory that the Pacific Ocean was to
be me day the theater of a great com
merce, and that upon y its ' shores ya
great empire of wealth and population
â was to be founded. The statesmen contem
poraneous with Jefferson saw plainly that
the establishment of a great common
wealth to expand Into a powerful nation
would be a menace to the United States;
hence the expansion of our territory to.
the Pacific Ocean. Time has passed and
we are to-day in the presence of the ful
fillment of all the prophecies that have
been made by the statesmen of all times,
even down as late as William H. Seward,
who declared that the Pacific Ocean was
to be the theater of a national drama,
surpassing in magnitude and grandeur all
past human history.

The most prominent men in this â  city,
without. an exception,. favor the proposi-
tion. â â¢'. __?'?"â â  ' â¢' .-'â â¢ -. â¢ ' â '-.
Mayor Charles Francee asserted that
the idea of holding an exposition on this
Coast In 1901 was a good one and that he
had favored the proposition .when it was
advanced by The Call last. year. It would,
he believes, materially advance California
interests, not only in other States, but,
coming as it Would after the Paris expo
sition, would advertise to the whole world
that our State Is the Land of Sunshine,
Fruit and Flowers. :..-â¢â  :.-:-.;- - , â¢-.
County Surveyor Lou G. Hare believes
the exposition a -:* good thing and said; :
"The exposition is all right and will be a
great benefit to. the State at large. â 'â¢ As in
the case of the Midwinter Fair, this con
templated : exposition : Will . advertise the
advantages, of our State to the whole out
side world.: It Is advisable for the State
to appropriate money for the fair." â¢-'
Attorney J. W. Bryanâ l consider thÂ©
proposed exposition will be the best thing
for San Francisco people as well as for
Californians at large.that?can possibly be
suggested: as. a means, to advertise the
Stte, We have unbounded resources here
and -why not display them. The approprl
atlon asked of the State- will, I believe,
be inadequate and.should be larger.-. But
by other means a sufficient amount can
'readily be raised to make- the affair the
most. success fufoflts kind in the world, -^
Attorney G. A. Doughertyâlt is a bad
time to talk of expending a vast sum of
mone:iu for.i in. 05110"- but at the^same
tlme^the idea Is a good one all through
and I think it can be worked out stlsfac
tprlly on the present plans. .-:, .
Chris Thorp of .the ahrllch-Cornett
Company believes that the State should
appropriate a sum sufficient to insure the
success of the purposed exposition.. "This
done." said Mr. Thorp, "the citizens will
:do the rest." â '...
C. F. Grant of Young & Grant: assert-
Ed that the idea was good and that all the
Assemblymen â¢ and Senators should con-
cur with : the plans suggested' by the ex
position Committee.
V. D. Black, .manager -of : y the Sperry
Flour Company's, mill, remarked that the
exposition would be a. great advertise
; ment '. for the .-. whole : Pacific Coast and
should be held in. 1901 â¢
Mr. Griffin, of the firm of Griffin Bros.â
The Pacific Ocean Exposition will be a
grand, success provided the State appro
priates a sufficient. amount to make it so.
The Legislature should not hesitate to
pass the bills. Of course the advisability
depends upon ; the season, 7 but : with? good
crops this year, the ;. ' exposition cannot
help being a grand success.
From many /others like opinions .were
gained: and it was the' consensus of opin
ion/that* both Senator Flint and Assent
blyman Feliz would be: upheld if they
voted favorably upon the appropriation
bill. .y'
AS SEEN 7BY ? PESSIMISTS. 'â  *
NAPA, Feb. 14â J. A. Fuller, Mayor of
Napa," said - concerning the exposition to
be held in San Francisco In 1901: .."I am
not in favor of that exposition, because
in the first- place it is premature. It
comes too soon after the exposition at
Paris. Secondly, : the working classes . will
not indorse and enjoy, it .because of the
hard y times and the â¢ recent scarcity .of
crops. The: minds of our great men -are
occupied with the present disturbances in
.the Philippines, and they will not turn
their attention to the exposition, If' it
were postponed for a few years we should
i gain many '.'new points and ideas .'which?
would be advantageous to the exposition.
It might be beneficial to a few people in
San Francisco, to the railroads and big
enterprises; but the. laboring classes
would have to pay for It, on top of the
taxation required for the recent war with
Spain; and . they would get : nothing out of
it. I like to see San Francisco first in
everything; ? She is a great city? but this
exposition, would take- a great deal of
good hard . cash from the poor man; whom
it would injure mor- than it would benefit?
I am.in. favor of waiting. three years after
the Paris Exposition closes. : By that time
?the Philippine question will be settled and
i the inhabitants of those Islands might be
j prepared- to assist the exposition them
selves with .an exhibition of something
entirely new."?;.-.?: y,-.7? 'â '../ . â ââ¢ ?;:â¢

pressed himself as. being strongly in favor
of holding an exposition in San Francisco
in 1901. He said: :-.â¢
"It would be a splendid thing, especially
as it follows the Paris Exposition. Tne

SAN BERNARDINO. Feb. .14.âPresi
dent J. B. Frith of the Board of City
Trustees expressed himself very strongly
in favor of the exposition at San Fran
cisco in 1901:. "It. would be better for us,"
he said, "if it could be held at Los An
geles, but that is impossible, and I. would,
therefore, very strongly urge: it for San
Francisco.- Southern California will "et
its share of the benefit and the whole
State would reap advantages from it.
People drawn to- such an exposition would
not go home without : seeing. Southern
California. Every town in Southern Cal
ifornia should sand a petition: to the

Gage, ; strongly urging an appropriation
for this exposition" proposed for 1901."-

whether I am awake or asleep when I
look around and cannot see a vacant
Chair. It seems to me that I have solved
the problem of having a well-filled
church on Sundays. Have the morning

First Unitarian Church. .... . â¢ â 
Colonel John P. Irish presided over the
largest attendance that? has ever met at
the Unitarian church on the occasion of
its annual meeting. The colonel was mas
: ter of ceremonies and for the..,first time,
the routine of .business -..was? relieved by
a banquet and musical programme. Three
hundred invitations were . issued and
three hundred people sat down to dinner.
It was this unique incident that caused
the pastor to make the remark Just
quoted. y yy ?y ..;:>:- .... â ..'â :â

the. many branches of church work are

the Woman's Auxiliary, Judge: J. W. Stet
son for the Unity Club, Mrs, R. P. Glea
â¢soriyfor;. the Starr King Fraternity, all
presented facts which were very gratify

The â¢ following board of: trustees was
elected: Mrs, W. G. Tripp, Mrs. C. *' H.
Redington. John P. Irish, J. A. Bliss
Hugh Hamilton, David Bush, John Russ,
J. W. Stetson, Francis Cutting,. A. W.

Letters were read from Dr. C. W. Wendte
and - Rev. ?T. C. I Williams, former pastor
of the church.
MRS. REGAN IS HELD?
The argument of counsel in the case of
Mrs. Elizabeth Regan,, charged with the
murder of Policeman Kennedy, engaged
the. attention of? Judge.- Graham .almost
the whole of yesterday, and' after pa
tiently, listening to both sides" the Judge
held the defendant to . answer, before the
Superior Court, as he thought it had been
shown that a crime had been 'committed.
Mrs. Regan did not show the slightest
emotion at the decision of the Judge.
.Her attorney, James. Long, asked that
she be admitted to bail; as there was. in
his opinion, nothing to show that she had
not' acted in " self-defense. " The Judge
said he would consider- the matter and
give his decision this morning.

AN EXTRA SESSION NEEDED.
WHEN the House of Representatives broke all
records by the amount of work It accomplished
. last December before adjourning, for the holi
days, there was a widespread belief that the same de
cree of energy would be .continued throughout the
session, and that when Congress adjourned it;. would
have so effectually dealt with all. measures of 7 press-'
ing importance that an extra session of the iricom
mg Congress would be unnecessary.
That belief was never shared by. The Call, and in
spite of the prevailing opinion, to the contrary, â¢-.- it
maintained the outlook. was by no means so promis
ing as appeared. ; We' directed attention to the
fact that the Senate had broken no record in the way
of legislation and that the action of the House had
no other effect than that of sending to the Senate
a little earlier than usual one or two appropriation
bills and had not really advanced legislation to an
appreciable extent.
That this view was correct is now evident to all.
Late reports from Washington are to the effect that
Congress is so far behind in its? work it will hardly
be able to pass the routine bills before the time comes
for adjournment. There is no .\y; very little hope of the
passage of the Nicaragua canal bill, the shipping bill,
the currency reform bill, the army reorganization bill,
the Hawaiian bill, or even , the navy personnel bill.
That being so it is clear there ought to be; an extra
session of Congress. In fact, it is! one of the defects
of our system of government that a Congress elected
in November of one year should not assemble to carry
out the will of the people until the December of the
year following. Last fall the people elected, a Con
gress of sound-money men, and chose legislators in
States" where Senatorial contests were, pending who
would elect. sound-money Senators. Thus they as
sured to. the McKinley administration: the support of
a Congress that can be counted on to carry out its
policies, and yet under our precedents that Congress
will not assemble and get down to business for nearly
a year to come.
â¢ If, as now- seems likely, the present Congress ex
pires by limitation of term before it has time to deal
with such measures as those enumerated, an extra
session will be imperative. Many of the issues at
stake are too pressing to be kept waiting. The Presi
dent served the country well by promptly calling this
Congress in extra session to revise the tariff and pro
tect the industries of the country, and he will serve it
well again by calling the incoming Congress together
with equal .promptness to enact other measures not
less important than the tariff.
NOT HAPPY IN JAIL.
TWO of the cleverest rogues ever operating in
this, .vicinity were lately convicted and sen
tenced to San Quentin for fifteen months. One
was a professional swindler and ex-convict v named
Bain, and the other a woman who had several names,
but for general use preferred that of Allison. These
two unworthies conducted a marriage bureau, the
woman being the bait and the man adroitly propelling
selected victims in the direction of the trap.
.Bain's strong point seems to be his nerve. He has
written a letter begging pardon for his partner,
basing it on the remarkable ground that jail life is
not to her liking, that the surroundings are such as
she has not been accustomed to, and that she lacks
adaptability to the new conditions. In other words,
she would rather prowl about seeking whose sub
stance she might devour, finding here a sealskin coat,
there a basket of champagne, and over yonder a lot
of jewelry, in each instance accompanied by a sucker
* to foot the bills.
Perhaps there is no necessity for stating that the
proper receptacle for this document is a waste
basket. The pair got off lightly as it was, and
whether or not they enjoy incarceration is a matter
absolutely of no consequence. If every criminal,
after sniffing the atmosphere of jail, were to have the
privilege of declining to breathe it, there would be
comparatively little use for jails. The pair under con
sideration are no better than other criminals â
they are far worse than the majority.
In Colorado Springs recently the mercury fell 35
degrees in half an hour. The Coloradans could well
have exclaimed, "What a fall was there, my country
men," only they were too busy keeping from freezing
to think about it.
Joseph Cordes need not expect any sympathy for
having, been sent to jail, his offense being the hug
ging of a girl who objected. There are enough girls
who do not object.

OUR TRADE AND OUR EXPOSITION.
LORD BERESFORD has : expressed in a
. striking phrase the. mutual . relations of the
â¢ United States and the Pacific Ocean. â  It â¢" is
"America's ocean," he said. The statement has the
double merit of being at once a definition and? : a
prophecy. It states a geographical fact . : , of the
present and intimates ; the coming of. a time when tx
panding commerce shall make that ; : fact the most
potent of the great world. of trade. .
" Since it is to-be our ocean, the scene of our lar
gest commercial activities, it behooves us to begin
the vast enterprise of exploiting it. An important
step-in that direction . will . be the opening of the
pacific Ocean Exposition, which is now under con
sideration. By an exhibition carried out on the scale
proposed we shall attract to our city .the attention of
: the commercial world. and hasten the coming of the
time when San Francisco will be the. recognized
metropolis of. the Pacific, the sails of our ships
whiten the whole vast expanse of waters from China
to Australasia. /,
In speaking . of the : ' proposed y enterprise Lord
Beresford said: ''Such art exposition would certainly
be a grand thing for San Francisco. Everything of
that kind does great, good, because it brings large
bodies of the best kind of people; together, attracts
â World-wide attention to the place where the exposi
tion is being held, creates argument and discussion
along desirable 'lines,: and is of a .-educational
value from a commercial standpoint
Of course. in all this our. distinguished visitor has
told us nothing new. His words have a value, how
ever, because they are the utterances of id sagacious,
earnest man, who has been for some time almost
wholly occupied in studying the trade conditions of
the Pacific and considering how they can be best
made to serve the interests â¢of peace, commerce and
civilization. They are, therefore, most opportune at
this time, since they serve to remind us how much we.
have at stake in the Pacific and how; Aye can profit by
the advantage our situation gives.
The amount of money required to carry out ian ex
position on a scale of sufficient magnitude to provide
a comprehensive display of the trade possibilities- of
the Pacific will be large : as a matter of course, ibut
it will be slight -in comparison with the vast benefits
that are sure to flow from it.
An exposition: is, in fact, almost an . imperative
necessity of the time. We are soon to have a law
providing for the upbuilding of ' our American mer
chant marine, and with that will come a rapid ex
pansion of our shipping- ; At the same time the de
velopment of the Oriental trade. will proceed rapidly?
Many American cities will contest for that com
merce. If San Francisco is to hold her place as the
metropolis of that trade she must act with the energy
of a metropolis and make her advantages known.
That can be better accomplished by .an exposition
than in any other way. The Pacific Ocean is ours, as
Lord Beresford says, but unless we cultivate it with
enterprise we shall .not : profit much by : the. owner-,

CALIFORNIA AS AN IMPERIAL
COLONY.
IT -is startling for .American citizens, yin : thirty-two
States of this Union, to be informed that they are
: . only living under the constitution through the
grace and favor of Congress. But .that in substance
is exactly what they have been told by Professor Jud
son of the Chicago University in : an elaborate argu
ment, i* stolen by some of the expansion papers, .to
which The Call has already. alluded. He distinctly
argues that the term "United States of America,"
fiom: the establishment of the Government, has meant ?
only the States that are admitted and united, and
that, ; except as to . certain personal rights; it does? not
include and never has included, territorial acquisitions, :
In plain words, he asserts that the interpretation of
the constitution is "progressive and. flexible," arid ;
that the uniform development into States of territory
heretofore .Â«â  acquired resulted ; -merely from ''policy"
and not from "constitutional necessity/ It follows,
&nd indeed is admitted by Professor Judson, that the
thirteen original States formed the Union, and that
every, foot of territory beyond their limits, without
any violation of the constitution, might have been
governed by Congress as imperial colonies or in any
form it might have chosen to adopt! ';:"'
The niceties of constitutional interpretation are be
yond the range of discussion in the daily press. But
there are a few broad views of the constitution that
are as intelligible to the average reader as to the
ablest lawyer. We have repeatedly said that there
has been literally no argument in favor of the reten
tion of the Philippines thai merits serious considera
tion. Whenever such an argument is attempted it
carries on its face the evidence that it is the ebul
lition of a crank or the sophistry of a paid advocate.
A very striking illustration of this fact is supplied by
the paper of Professor Judson, above mentioned. In
respect to all territory he holds that, while allegiance
from its inhabitants may be exacted and enforced,
citizenship is a privilege that may or may not be con
ferred. This is a startling doctrine to be proclaimed
in the .teeth of the leading constitutional writers and
statesmen of the country, of the terms. of the ces
sion of the" Northwestern Territory, of treaties with
Spain, with France and With Mexico, and of the uni
form-practice of the Government. To the average
American citizen, educated in the common schools
and accustomed to Washington's Farewell Address,
to- the Declaration of Independence, to the celebra
tion of our national anniversary and to centennial
revivifications of the spirits of our revolutionary
ancestors, it is profoundly dangerous to be informed
that allegiance and citizenship are not correlative, and
that the right of representation was practically lim
ited to the original thirteen States. For, we repeat,
that if the assertions of Professor Judson and the
entire group of expansionists and imperialists are
true, thirty-two out of the forty-five States, without
any violation of the constitution but in strict accord
ance with its terms, might now have been enjoying
I the inestimable advantages of imperialism under 'the
supervision of Congress.? If the views of the expan
sionists in relation to the Philippines are now cor
rect, they were equally correct when the North
western Territory, when Florida and Louisiana,. when
the entire body of territory from the Eastern border
to the Pacific Ocean, was acquired, and if California
has become a member, of an indissoluble Union it
obtained that position not under the constitution? but
through the deference and courtesy of Congress in
1850.
If the thirteen colonies, when they declared free
dom/equality before the law and the right of self
taxation to be inalienable, were self-deluded, and
Great Britain was then only exercising the identical
authority that 'Congress has since uniformly pos
sessed, the signers of the Declaration of Indepen
dence perpetrated a fraud upon mankind, our Revolu
tionary War was a bloody and protracted sham, our
constitution was a ' temporary political device, and
our Union was and is a rope of sand. On these as
sumptions, and on" them only, Professor -Judson and
the half-fledged brood of expansionists are right. We
think, however, that the American people still be

LORD BERESFORD.
THIS English gentleman, Admiral, and Anglo-
Saxon cousin of ours, has been fitly welcomed in
San Francisco, and has talked of his errand to
Asia and America. â¢ -
â ;'â ' The officers of the British navy are also diplomats
in their ability to disclose meaning between the lines,
and this genial sailor is no tyro in the art. â ?
His mission appeals strongly to our commercial in
stinct and is' conveyed in terms that . flatter our local
pride. It is a' pleasant picture thrown upon the can
vas â the trade' of Asia, that made Wisby, Venice,
Genoa and London? in turn, now to be. the greatest
commerce in . the world, and " San Francisco i and
Hongkong to be made by it the greatest seaports in
the. world, provided we. join England, Germany and
japan to oppose ''Adam Zad, the bear that walks like
a man."- 7. â¢ - 'â¢â¢..â â  y.\ .
France is in Tonquin, Russia is in Manchuria,
japan is conquesting Formosa, which was part of her
indemnity from China, and Adam Zad is ranging over
the Korean Peninsula. . The Franco-rÃussian alliance
puts the two nations on either side of Hongkong,
which is English territory. Germany is at Kiaochau.
All the allies are present, and we are seeking to found :
Christian civilization in the Philippines for commer
cial purposes. We never interfered in the balance
of power in Europe. We tipped it neither up nor
down. ; But suddenly it is developed that the contest
for a balance is transferred to Asia, and we are asked
to jump into the. scale with England, Germany and
Japan.
Now, each of these nations has conquests there, or
possessions acquired when their rightful owners were
busy about something-else.. If Russia and France
force a partition of China, the. trans-Siberian railway
will have a terminus on . Russian territory on . Lao
Tpng or Pechili, and France will lie across the
route of the British rail A*ay over Bur man. to Hong-.
kong. The : Mediterranean â¢; is an â¢ English .lake,
â  guarded by Gibraltar, Malta arid her posts . that can
wigwag each other all the way across to her canal
that cuts Suez* and then from Aden to the Hindostari
peninsula land and water, are hers clean to Mandalay.
It is a laudable ambition to connect hither and
farther India by a railway system across China to
Hongkong and thence by steamer to Victoria and rail
across the Dominion, giving. England an all rail and
water route* around the planet, and but little of it out
cf sight of her flag. y. .'â¢ : .
We showed the world how to build railways over
deserts arid mountains, and were the first to connect
the great oceans across the continent. In these
grand schemes of Adam Zad and Great Britain we
look on with, the interest of a pioneer in great con
struction and daring engineering. But it is by means
to be admitted that we have profit in the part of a
makeweight in this contest over a European balance
in Asia, especially as our part in it requires of us to
conquest and permanently retain the Philippines.
Admiral Beresford has flattered us with the statistics
of our trade in Asia, but when we compare our world
trade and its increase With that of the nations which
are burdened with a colonial system and its attendant
military arid naval establishments, we are impressed
that we have been constantly gaining, while the na
tions with colonies and conquests, including Adam
Zad, have been as constantly losing. The lesson
seems to be that nations do not carry on business and
war successfully at the same time,?
In his enthusiastic reception speech to our genial
guest the vice-president of our Chamber of Commerce
declared that the navy was the pioneer of commerce,
which goes where the navy clears the way. That is a
proper nautical sentiment to be uttered in the pres
ence of a British Rear Admiral and American Com
modore and other grizzled tars, but a glance at our
trade .statistics shows that our best commerce in
volume and profitâ indeed.^. per cent of all our for
eign tradeâ is where our navy never fifed a hostile
shot or appeared except at the innocuous social func
tion, or cleared the way for anything except the next
course, at a complimentary dinner.
7 Perhaps the reluctance of Spaniards to fight as
allies of the Filipinos is due to more than one rea
son. In the first place they know fighting against
the Americans to lack almost all the essential
elements of the successful picnic, and anyhow they
have had their fill of fighting for wages which never
come.
Just how Alger would keep soldiers in service for
a longer time than the terms of their enlistment stipu
lated remains to be seen. Probably the statement
ascribed to him might be termed a diplomatic bluff,
except that it is lacking in diplomacy.
At last the teachers have the pleasure of spending
a little of the money the city has been owing them,
but they must have the balance to the last penny.
San Francisco â  does not approve of "any scheme of
robbery.

A stage robber recently pleaded insanity, but as the
only ground for the plea was the implied belief that a
jury could be befooled into accepting it, he would
better have pleaded something elseâ for instance,
guilty.
Insinuations that Milton Green is playing sick are
groundless and unfair. He was not well when he
went to Sacramento, and his experience there would

BANK COMMISSION REFORM.
".'. "â  : PART IL '
Editor Call ? Had the suggestions of
the first Board of Bank Commissioners
in its report of January, 18S0, to the
Legislature been adopted the People s
Home Savings Bank, Fresno, Loan and
Savings Bank : and Union Savings Bank
of San: Jose would never have come into
existence and hundreds of deluded and
defrauded depositors would have been
saved from ruin and misery.
; An important j part- of that report
reads as follows:
SHOULD SAVINGS BANKS DO A COM
? â¢-.- MERCIAL BUSINESS? .
â¢ The experience of the past eighteen
months has demonstrated to us the im
propriety: of savings banks being permit
ted- also to do. a commercial business.
In no quarter have we met so many em
barrassing questions as in matters con
nected with the savings banks which were
so doing. The present laws provide that
savings banks having a paid up capital,
of reserve and capital combined, of three
hundred thousand .dollars ($300,000) . may
make loans on personal security, buy and
sell exchange, etc.; in other words, fulfill
the functions of a bank of discount (with
the limitation created by the bank com
missioners' act,: requiring 50 . per cent of
their loans to be thereafter on real es
tate). - . "-. : "â  â â 
'â  The first reports sent to us (In July,
1878) and : our earlier examinations re
vealed to , us the fact that many of the
savings banks were ignorant of or Indifer
ent to the-. restriction'.' placed by law: upon
their actions.
â¢y After enumerating six savings banks
which had "come to grief" .from doing
this dual business the Commissioners
continue: 'â ?â ??. ? ? ??.?â â¢
? The Capital Savings Bank (Sacrament
to), which went 7 into â ; liquidation .a: few
days ago (January 2), is another and the
last instance of the utter Incompatibility
between these two radically distinct
Classes ;. of banking and is the seventh
example of the practical want of success
of such unhealthy "unions." When we
first: examined ,the last- named bank in
November, 1878, we had to "write off"
over two hundred thousand dollars' (near
ly its whole reserve fund) on account of
losses which, We believe, were: principally
incurred in Its commercial business. Does
hot this, record of eighteen months prove
that the functions of a savings and of a
commercial bank are so distinct and un
congenial i that they ought never to be
united in one. corporation? The matter
is so self-evident that it seems almost
superfluous to discuss It, but we shall add
ourselves and quote some additional rea
sons in support of our view. No? one can
dispute the fact that â¢ the qualifications
required to make a-, successful savings
bank manager are entirely different. from
those which should belong to the manager
of a commercial bank and are seldom, if
ever, united In one person. Among writ
ers on banks and banking laws the opin
ion is almost uniform that savings banks
and banks of discount should not even
be allowed to locate in the same building,
when they are both managed by the same
officers . to
*' â¢â¢' .*.'..' . ;*â¢-. 'â¢'â  ' *'â¢'.-: '*-.',' â¢â¢*: â¢ ' â¢ ,-' '
For the . foregoing reasons we have no
hesitation in recommending that no sav
ings, bank not now engaged in the prac
tice of so doing should be allowed here
after to make loans: on personal security
or to transact, any business, which is
properly the province of a bank of dis
count, and that those" institutions which
are so doing, in accordance with.the laws
at present in force, should be required, on
or beforo the Ist of January, 1582, to. elect
which busihess they will pursue; and to
discontinue the Other,
In their report of the following year
(1881) the Commissioners ! repeat this
and other suggestions to the Legis
lature in these words:
Repeal the law allowing savings banks
with a paid up capital, or : paid up capital
and reserve combined,: of $300,000, to make
loans without "adequate security on real
or personal property.-' . (The object of this
Is to prevent any savings bank hereafter
organized, or which is hot at present so
doing, making loans on personal security,
which, is properly the province of com
.'mercial banks.) :.- â  '.'
. Require all banks hereafter to have an
appraisement in writing, signed- by at
least one competent person, of each piece
of real estate mortgaged .to them, and
said valuation, to ; be kept on file. , â â ;â¢â¢
â  : Prohibit any diminution or division of
the reserve fund of. any savings bank (ex
cept to offset losses or depreciation in the
value of assets), until the paid up capital
and reserve together or the reserve fund :
alone, if the bank is on the mutual plan,
shall exceed 10 per cent of the liability to
depositors, and then, only to the extent of
such excess. â¢
These suggestions fell upon deaf ears.:
The dominant party just then was too
busy : trying '-'to. legislate the Commis
sioners out. of office (the effort failing
by only one. vote in the Assembly) and
was more interested in providing places
for three of the new- Governor's politi
cal friends than safeguards for hun
dreds of bank depositors! It is this
sort of thing which has ' impaired the
value of the Bank Commission from the
beginning. y; â¢'.â¢.' ?7 ,-???. '..'
The first amendment to the bank
commission act was made after it had
been. in operation nine years and then
began the decadence of the commission.
By this amendment the salary of the
Commissioners was raised from. $3000
to $3600 per ,year each, which was
proper enough if a little "joker" had
not been inserted which reads: "No
person while holding any other office
or engaged in business of any kind re
quiring his personal attention between
the hours of 9 a. m. and 4 p. m. shall
serve as Bank Commissioner." To be
eligible for this office since then one
must be a failure or a . do-nothing.
These qualifications (?) seem to have
been mostly confined to residents of
country towns, as San Francisco hasn't
furnished a member of the â¢ board for
some years. If executive ability instead
of executive friendship, had been the
test of its members the commission
would have done better service. >
The Bank Commission has at present
the supervision of ; 233 active banking
institutions and twenty banks in liqui
dation, with some $300,000,000 of re
sources. " ' ' ''â  ';' â â :â¢;â  y/ . "
Three men cannot examine all these
banks thoroughly once a year In ad
dition to supervising the affairs of
twenty liquidating banks. My plan for
better work at small additional expense
is to add two members to the present
board, reducing the salaries of the
Commissioners to $3000 per year each
(as originally). Let the secretary's
salary remain at ; $2400 per year, but
limit the total amount of traveling ex-'
penses, office rent, stationery, printing,
etc.? to $4400 per annum as -at present,
j this to Include the printing of the an
| nual reports heretofore done by the
State printing office at enormous ex-,
pense to the State.
I learn from official sources that the
Bank Commissioners' report for '95 cost
$3186 45, and that " for '96, $2422 90. -7
The former ' (800 volumes) cost $3 98
and the latter (1000) $2 42 per volume.
The total yearly expenses of the com
mission since 1895 have been $17,600, di
vided as follows:
Three Commissioners at $3000 ....'.". .SIO,BOO
Secretary â¢ 2,400

If my suggestions are adopted the an
nual expenses will be $21,800, divided
as follows:
Five Commissioners at $3000 $15,000
Secretary 2,400
j Traveling fund................;......... 2,000
I Rent, stationery, printing,? etc 2,400
Total ........... $21,800
: The saving to the State on the print
! ing of reports, etc., is "about $3000 per
year, and the additional expense to the
banks ($4200) will not be felt when
levied on their resources instead of
their deposits. The assessment for the
current year (July, '98-99) was 8% cents
on each. $1000 of deposits. Under the
new system (with two additional Com
missioners,- etc.) it will be less than 8
i cents on each" $1000 of resources.
I Many of the best mortgages of the
Union Savings Bank of San Jose seem
ito have been hypothecated â¢ to other
banks, which made it easier to deceive
the Bank Commissioners as to the true
condition of the bank. â ?" "'â 'â¢,.'â¢
â 'â ' Banks know when other banks are
"shaky" long before the public and are
rarely sufferers when the final crash
comes. To prevent banks having this
big advantage over other creditors and
to assist the Bank Commissioners in
discovering what is generally the first
symptom of a bank's weaknessâ the.
hypothecation of its securitiesâ the fol
lowing amendment concerning savings
banks is suggested: . .'-'-'.
--"No assignment made by any savings
bank to any other corporation or per
son of any mortgage or deed of trust
of real estate held by it shall be valid
unless the same is recorded in the of
fice of the County Recorder of the
county in which the mortgaged prop
erty is situated 'arid a? certified copy of
such assignment as recorded filed in the
offlce of said Bank Commissioners."
And I am, while not positive, much
inclined to the opinion that a restric
tion something like this should be added
to the above: "Notice of the hypothe
cation or assignment: of any of its se
curities by ariy banking corporation or
ganized under the laws of this State to
another corporation or person shall be
filed with the Bank Commissioners
within twenty-four hours thereafter."

Twenty=Four Hours.
Ashinger, the Timer, Never
Left the Saddle ia All
That Time.
"'urns Pierce and Charles Ashinger
were the heroes of the first day in the
six-! bicycle race now in progress at
Mechanics' Pavilion. After twenty-four
hours the former had ridden seven and
a quarter miles farther than the previous
record for that length of time, which
was established by himself in the recent
race at Madison Square Garden, New
York.
Ashinger never left the saddle of his
bicycle in all those dredry hours, while
Pierce was oft but one minute, and this
was the result of an accident. Shortly
Incidental to the
r<fter 8 o'clock last night he collided with
John Lawson and both went down.
Pierce was up in an instant and was as
sisted on one of his spare machines.
"When his competitors heard the smash
they rede like mad and gained two laps
on him. Ashinger remained on his wheel
until 11:15 p. m., having then ridden
twenty-four hours and twenty-one min
utes without a dismount, covering* in that
time 4C9 miles and 7 laps. eiimm and
Miller also exceeded Pierces former rec
ord. Gimm covering 1591. miles and Miller
io^'s miles.
Throughout the day the big crowd of
riders kept up a steady grind that aver
aged twenty miles an hour. Many spec
tators who witnessed tiie start on Mon

was a continuous stream of visitors
throughout ihe day and all seemed to

In the evening the spectators, the mu
sic and the lights spurred the riders to
greater efforts. Julius did yeoman duty
Â«-.d a pacemaker, pioneering the ions
i tring of riders mile after mile at a fast
'pace. Gradually the men at the end of
the string began to lag and the leaders
soon gained one of the much coveted laps,
an eighth of a mile. The petroleum go

i roated the first outburst of enthusiasm
of the night. As he dashed past the plod
ding riders, Barnaby followed by Pierce,
Miller and others went after him. Barn
aby held on until he had gained two laps.
Pierce was satisfied with one. while the
others were content to watch them in
their mad dash around the track.
Mrs. Miller, the young bride of Cham

twenty-four hours in the pavilion.

TO REPAVE POLK STREET.
Meeting of the Directors of the Asso
ciation of Improvement Held.
A meeting of the Polk-street Improve
ment Association's directors was held at
the store of L. H. Kohn, at Sacramento
md Polk streets, last night, at which the
following were present: Louis H. Kohn
chairman), William McMann, Johnston
Elliott, W. B. Bradbury, Val Schmidt and
Nathan Bibo. â¢ â  :?>?,
These gentlemen represent the original
Polk-street Improvement Club, which
originated the movement for the better
ment of the streets in the commercial
portion of the city, by the united efforts
if property owners and tenants. Through
the efforts of this organization came tne
ranging of electric lights over the street
:enters -at the public expense. ,â 
Encouraged by former success, the di
rectors last evening discussed the advis
ability of having Polk street repaved from
Sutter to Jackson with either bitumen
ir the wooden pavement such as has been
aid in front of the Parrott building on
Market street. To promote this much
leslred object a delegation from the asso
;iation will appear before the Supervisor!
md urge its adoption. The proposition
to widen Polk street from Sutter to Jack
son was also -considered, and the most
feasible plan was advanced by Chairman
Louis Kohn, who suggested that two feet
be taken from each sidewalk, that con
duits be placed along the side of tne
street and all the .wires placed un
derground. By doing this the thorough
fare would be made attractive and great
ly improved from a business point of
view. A further discussion of the scheme
will be had before the Supervisors are
asked to carry the plan into effect. At
present a majority of the property own
ers on the line of the street favor the
proposition.

PRIVATE SHAY FOUGHT
BRAVELY AT MANILA
ANOTHER member of the
First California has distin
guished himself. This time
it is Private John Shay
of San Francisco, who has won
for himself lasting glory. He was
one of the very first to respond
to the call for volunteers. The fact
that he was only 18 years of age
did not in the least deter him
from "enlisting. He Is a mem
ber of Company I, which, when
the regiment sailed, was com
manded by the brave Captain
Rheinhold fllchter. â¢ Young
Shay was one of the first to land
at Guam, and he also was fore
most in that fatal charge at Ma
late when Captain Richter lost
his life. During the recent fight
ing. he has been with his company
and has seen constant and "hard
fighting.- So far he has been for
tunate to escape without a
wound.
The young soldier ! is the son
of Daniel Shay of this city, who
is connected with the city Fire
Department. At one time Private
Shay was employed by the West-
crn Union Company as a messenger. He bears an excellent reputation for
honesty, sobriety and pluck, and his many friends are hopeful that he may
be spared to return safely to his home.

S. C. ROWLEY TAKES A DRINK
COSTING $460.
A Tale of the Tenderloin Which
Involves Two Men, Two Maids
and a Great Deal
of Beer.
Mr. S. C. Rowley of Ingleside and. San
â Francisco lives, when he is at home, at
36*4 Geary street. But Mr. Rowley is
not always at home. There are times
when, prompted by his love for the beau
tiful and vivacious in nature, he has been
known to wander from the quiet domes
ticity of his own fireside and to explore
with buoyant if uncertain footsteps, the
mysteries of the merry tenderloin. These
little excursions of Mr. Rowley's have not
been one or two in number. They have
been many. So many, in fact, that Mr.
Rowley, pondering upon the wealth of
knowledge and experience he had there
obtained, chose to consider himself a man
of the world. He was and he still is a
man of the world, but since last Satur
day night he has been far wiser and an
infinitely sadder one than he ever was
before. . 'yy/, y/y
There is an old platitude that says 'tis
better to have loved and lost than never
to have loved at all. Mr. Rowley says
the fellow who first gave utterance to the
platitude never ran up against the com
bination of tenderloin . fairy : and knock
out drops or he would have changed his
tune. The incident which changed Mr.
Rowley from an optimist to a pessimist
and caused him to look upon love with
the jaundiced eye of a cynic occurred
somewhere between 11 o'clock Saturday
night and 2 o'clock Sunday morning, and
Is as follows:
Between the hours named Mr. Rowley
was standing on the corner of Ellis and
Powell streets with his hands in his
trousers pockets. Mr. Rowley was stand
ing because it was far easier to stand
than to. walk; and he had his hands in
his pockets because he had forgotten his
gloves. But that did not matter. It
rather added to his enjoyment. For each
pocket was stocked with large, round
double eagles, and he could- run them
through his fingers until he had counted
460 dollars without any kid or dogskin to
intervene and act as a non-conductor to
the electric thrill they sent tingling
through his whole being.
Mr. Rowley had just commenced to go
over his pile for the fourth time when
his dream of happiness was Interrupted
by one who, hurriedly emerging from a
near-by building, started across the street
to a saloon on the opposite corner.
In the hurrying one Mr. Rowley recog
nized A. H. Rowland, an old friend and
former partner in the horse business. Mr.
Rowland was in a hurry because he was
being consumed by a Sahara-like thirst
and wished to quench it. He, nowever,
tarried long. enough to Invite. Mr. Rowley
to join him, which that gentleman did
without any unnecessary urging.
While an attentive gentleman, attired
iii a white coat, a diamond win and other
apparel busied himself in providing for
their necessities, Mr. Rowland confided to
his friend that he and his lady were cele
brating the first anniversary of their wed
ding in a room across the street, and
would be glad to have Rowley join them.
Rowley was more than willing; so each
Gentleman filling his arms with large cold
ottles (of beer), started. across the street.
Arriving at the room, Mr. Rowley was
presented .to Miss Geraldine Kingston, re
siding on Edd" street, and who, because
"she Is a good fellow," is generally. known
as "Jerry." A merry party of three was
soon tapping the beer. - .. .". . t .
Mr. Rowley enjoyed himself, but. he felt
lonely and longed for a wedding of his
own. No sooner were his wishes made
known than a messenger was awakened
and dispatched with a note, and soon the
party was made four by the arrival of
Miss Dollie Martin, a tender maiden who
lives with her mother on Turk street.
Miss Martin . was thirsty. Therefore,
more beer Was opened and that was where
the trouble began. Mr. Rowley does not
know who opened .the beer. All he is
certain of ls that he drank some of it and
began to get groggy and tried to brace
up. It was no use. He went "out so
fast that he fell in a heap on the. floor.
He has a dim recollection of being lifted
on the bed; of Rowland and the Kings
ton woman going out; of Miss Martin
speaking words of comfort to him. Then he
lost all consciousness of things mundane.:
He thought he was a - skyrocket at a
Fourth of July celebration; that some one
touched a match to him and he continued
to ascend until he woke up to find himself
"busted."
Not a cent of his $460 was left. He did
not know what to do so he sought advice.
Some one acquainted with the San Fran
cisco police force advised him to see Chief
Lees. The case was put into the hands
of Detective Cody and warrants were is
sued for Rowland, the Kingston woman
and Miss Dollie Martin.
Perhaps they will be arrested and per
haps they won't. When seen last night
Detective' Cody said he had a clew, but
he wished the matter kept secret until he
could locate and arrest the guilty parties,
who were in hiding. Evidently the guilty
parties know who is on their track and
have little fear of the result, for last
night they were around town, in their old
haunts., as usual, showing as little concern
for Detective Cody as they would for a
blind pencil vendor. Possibly they are
acquainted with Annie Piggott, If so
they know their business, and knowing it
realize how little they have to fear from
the local Hawkshaws.
Out at the track, where Rowley runs
Kaiser Ludwig and Ocorona, the bookies
are giving 100 -. to 1 against Rowley's
money. _________^__

HOLLAND IS
HOT AND ON

HeCriticizesPerrault's
Sudden Action.
INVEIGHS AGAINST INJUSTICE
FINANCE COMMITTEE GAVE
NOTHING â TOOK MUCH.
Money They. Saved on Appropriations
for Building and Furnishing
Went to Funds Other
Than His.
Supervisor Holland is angry. He' was
an early visitor at the board rooms yes
terday, and railed at the action of the
Finance Committee in reducing appropri
ations in which he is interested.
At its meeting on Monday the board
took $20,000 from the fund for. the furnish
ing of the Hall of Justice; $10,000 from, the
proposed new police station; $6800 intended
for a new filter system in the City Hall
and $10,000 set aside for twenty-five ex
tra policemen. ""? 7 -??;?
The first three items are taken from the
budget, of Chairman Holland of the Build
ing Committee. Hence his anger. The
money thus taken is divided among many
depleted funds.
"The merchants of Kearny street have
already taken steps to have the action of
the board reconsidered in so far as it
relates to the Hall of Justice," said Mr.
Holland yesterday. "A petition is now
being circulated asking that the funds of
the new building be left intact and that
it be rushed to completion. All the money
originally appropriated is required to
place the new building in order ready for
occupancy. â¢ ' ' â 
"Dr. Perrault took snap judgment on me
in the matter and reduced the funds In
my care without giving anything in re
turn. There will be a deficiency of $4000
in the fund for repair of buildings, but he
did not replenish that in his redistribu
tion of the money taken from the original
appropriations. He took three-fourths of
the money from funds intended for build
ings and improvements, and the other
quarter from the appropriation for extra
patrolmen.
"I did not know until to-day that Dr.
Perrault went to the members of the
board before the meeting and asked them
to support the measure. I could have
offset this had I known of It at the time."
Supervisor Holland was in no amiable
frame of mind, and Intimated that his
colleague; Dr. Perrault, will have pet
measures he wishes to put through and
will find unexpected opposition to them.
Judge William P. Lawlor has not been
convinced that the criminal departments
of the Superior Courts should occupy the
quarters prepared for them in the Hall of
Justice. He holds that the influences sur
rounding the police courts are such as the

SHAFTER NOT ILL.
Reports Concerning His Serious Con-
dition Greatly Exaggerated.
Captain E. H. Plummer, of the Tenth
United States Infantry, aid to Major-Gen
eral Shafter, when asked last night about
the reports published, in the afternoon
press to the effect that General Shafter
was suffering from a return of the Cuban
fever and that his friends were alarmed
for his condition, said:
"General Shafter, since his return from
Cuba, has frequently, had these attacks
of fever. His physician has advised him
to continue taking quinine â¢ because tho
malaria was still in his system, but this
the general has not done. No one is at
all alarmed about him. Yesterday he suf
fered from a chill, but it was no worse
than several that he has had since he
reached San Francisco. I was with him
yesterday, and in the evening he was able
to dictate several- letters to me. He will
shortly return to the city. â¢ You need have
no hesitancy in saying that the reports
concerning the serious condition of Gen
eral Shafter have been greatly exagger
ated." yy â ;-:/.â¢"-*..- '. .--;.'.">:â¢'â '

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple? but Saf; and Ef-
fectual Cure for It.
Catarrh of stomach has long: been con-
sidered the next thing to Incurable. The
usual symptoms are a full or bloating
sensation after eating, accompanied some-
times with sour or watery risings, a for-
mation of gases, causing pressure on the
heart and lungs and difficult breathing;
headaches, fickle appetite, nervousness
and a general played out, languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the mouth,
coated tongue and if the Interior of the
stomach could be seen it would show a
slimy, Inflamed condition.
The cure of this common and obstinate
trouble is found in a treatment which
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before it has time to ferment
and Irritate the delicate mucous surfaces
of the stomach. To secure a prompt and
healthy digestion is the one necessary
thing to do and when normal digestion Is
secured the catarrhal condition will have
disappeared. 77?. y?
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase, Asep-
tic Pepsin, a little Nux, Golden Seal and
fruit acids. These tablets can now be found
at all drugstores under the name of Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, and not being a
patent medicine can be used with perfect
safety and assurance that healthy appe-
tite and thorough digestion will follow
their regular use after meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn st.,
Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh is a local
condition resulting from a neglected cold
in the head, whereby the lining membrane
of the nose becomes inflamed and the
poisonous discharge therefrom pass-
ing backward into the throat reaches
the '. stomach, thus producing , ca-
tarrh of the stomach. Medical au-
thorities prescribed for me for three
years for catarrh of the stomach without
cure, but to-day I am the happiest of men
after using only one. box of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I cannot find appropriate
words to express my good feeling. I have
found flesh, appetite and sound rest from
their use." â¢ Â° â¢?-?' y
â¢ Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets Is the safest
preparation =as well as the simplest and
most convenient remedy for any form of
indigestion, catarrh of the stomach, bil-
iousness, sour- stomach, heartburn and
bloating after meals. : â¢

stomach troubles, by addressing Stuart

seven months of the current cereal year were
4*1.744 barrels, against 483,232 during the same

total exports of wheat during the seven months
of 2,702.000 centals, valued at $3,419,000. against
868,000 centals at $14,016,900 last year. These
figures show the shortage ln last year's crop.
DRIED FRUIT AND RAISINS IN NEW
YORK.
The New York Commercial says: "There is
some request for peaches from interior points,
but the price Is too high to permit wide trading.
Conditions are about the same as at last re
ports, with prospects of a rise ln prices if de
mand Increases materially. Holders are con
fident, and feel Inclined to retain their goods
for the present, expecting to secure larger
profits later. . â ?',-'â 
"The prune combine, which was reported as
having been formed in California recently, has
had no influence on the markets here as yet.
Opinion has not changed since the organization
was announced, and most dealers are still skep
tical. Prices on spot goods are unchanged, and
buying Is not large. There is a moderate num
ber of small orders from dealers whose stocks
need replenishing, but no large buyers have
come into market as yet:
"Raisins appear to be slightly steadier. There
is an upward tendency on all grades, except
two and three crowns. They are still low and
weak, with no prospect of immediate change in
conditions, On the coast it ls said that trade
ls dull and featureless, and that there is no
prospect of a shift ln prices. Ungraded stocks
are moving out slowly and seem to meet all
the requirements of the trade, as well as the
more expensive graded goods.
"Figs are weaker. There has been a consid
erable decline in California stocks, and prices
are at the lowest ebb of the season. Low-grade
foreign goods are attracting more attention
than California fruit, but there is compara
tively little demand for any sort."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 14.â Stocks to-day ad
vanced moderately above the prices prevail
ing before the triple holiday. Commission
house business was much restricted, as the
severe storm has delayed small orders and kept
away many customers. " The attendance on the
Stock Exchange was diminished and prices
receded fractionally through the early trad
ing. The London market, too, was dull be
cause of storms throughout England and "Yan
kee" rails, which showed weakness before our
opening because of the blizzard, were subse
quently bought for London account. Burling
ton was a most prominent stock for strength
on a rumor that a refunding plan would be
put through at to-morrow'Â» meeting,
although the story lacked confirmation.
The other grangers were sympathetically
strong. Weather conditions were responsible
for lifting the price of the anthracite coalers
and rubber. The improving tone, which be
came noticeable before noon, spread to the
rest of the list as a rule, and values were gen
erally enhanced. Other features of strength
were the local traction shares and the Pacifies
and Pennsylvania. A number of industrials,
which showed early weakness, rallied, consid
erably.
The bond market ruled irregular during the
forenoon, but subsequently hardened under
the Influence of a good demand of the active
Hens. Total sales, $2,795,000. United States 4s

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 14.â Unexpected strength at
Liverpool, ln addition to light domestic re
ceipts, gave wheat a strong start. May opened
"_@%c higher at 73%Â©74 c, and as New York re
ported foreigners fair buyers of March and
May wheat at the seaboard . the price soon
touched 74-.C. The same was true of foreign
business here, the orders being generally to
buy ln short wheat. The visible statement
Boon forced itself upon the attention of the
traders, and as it gave early evidence of show
ing a considerable Increase it was suggestive
of caution to the buyers. The result was an
increase of 1.117.000 bushels for the ' week,
bringing the total up to 30,161,000 bushels. The,
market, however, in anticipation of some such'
addition to stocks, had become very heavy,
and before the actual announcement was made
the price of May wheat had dropped to 73% c,
and It got as low as 73'iÂ©73'4c before It recov
ered from Its declining tendency. The mar
ket ruled heavy all the time after the result of
the visible was known, while a good deal of
long property was for sale at the decline. May
dropped to 72%e, closing 72%Â©72% c.
The early strength in wheat and higher
cables started corn firm. . It was too freely
offered, however, to maintain the rise it com
menced with, and when wheat withdrew Its
support, it brought corn to the ground. May
lost %Â®%c.
Numerous outside buying orders and a good
speculative demand from elevator concerns
strengthened oats. The break in the other
grains caused a reaction, but the market held
fairly steady throughout the session. May
closed %c lower.
Heavy receipts of hogs and lower prices at
the yards handicapped provisions. The mar
ket ruled dull all day. Pork closed with a loss
of l"Â«gl2%c: lard. 7%c, and ribs. 5Â®7%c".

NEW THEORIES
ARE DISCUSSED
Hugh Craig in Accord
With Them.
OBSTACLES CAN BE OVERCOME
GEORGE A. NEWHALL ADVISES
DUE CAUTION.
Would Have the Chamber of - Com
merce Send a Commissioner
to Study Chinese Trade
Conditions.
The address made by Lord Charlea
Beresford before' the Chamber of Com
merce of this city on Monday afternoon
made a most profound impression on the
representative merchants and citizens of
this cify. There is no denying the fact
that the vast majority of those that heard
his Lordship agree with him, And that
they differ only, on immaterial points.
From the expressions that were to be
heard on all sides yesterday it would .ap
pear that the suggested trade alliance of
the two nations is not so very far off after
all. Many of the most prominent gentle
men, who are engaged in business here,
while they may not agree with his Lord
ship in every particular, are neverthe
less, in hearty accord with him In the
general run of his ideas and in the ad
vice that he gave. ??. :
Hugh Craig, ex-president of the Cham
ber of Commerce, when seen yesterday
said: â  ? .'
"I heartily agree with everything that
was said by Lord Beresford and I see no
difficulty that cannot be overcome by. the
good sense and honesty of the American
people. lam in full accord with po
sition taken by Lord Beresford on the
Oriental question, and I hold the same
unswerving faith in the capability and
statesmanship of the American people,
for meeting in an intelligent and states
manlike way all questions now to the
front in Hawaii, the Philippines, Cuba and
Porto Rico. There is no doubt in. my
mind but that, the American people will
justly govern the mixed Latin popula
tion, and that in the end they will so
educate them that they 'may be intrusted
with all of the details of the municipal
and local inter-island administration. *
"I am certain that as responsibility is
placed on us", the same spirit of fairness
and desire to do right, which is ever para
mount in the minds of the American peo
ple, will greatly help to solve any ques
tion that may arise for international con
sideration. As Lord Beresford so very
aptly stated, men will be found for every
occasion, as for instance, Dewey was the
man for the battle of Manila Bay. To
men like myself, familiar with the ad
ministration of her Majesty's Government
in Australia, New Zealand and the South
Sea Islands, there is no problem present
ing Itself in the Philippines which has not
already been thrashed out by colonial
statesmen to a successful Issue.
"You ask what 1 â â  gest that the
.
ration
of tl . itions thrown put to us by
, s here say most
â 
Ine" it to the administration. We have
in President McKinley and his Cabinet the
very bÂ».-st of man-rial the -world has ever
a:,l surely they are eminently
Qua â  indie lust such questions as
*"â¢â 'â 'â¢ pro] ; ord Beresford before
the Chanil.pr of Commerce. The only
trouble I can see ahead is that which may
arise from the egotism and impudence of
the University Pharisees, who, injecting
themselves as If they were the 'unco
quid' of the nation, make trouble where
none should arise."
George A. Newhall, the first vice presi
dent of the Chamber of Commerce, who
presided at the reception extended to Lord
Charles Peresford. when asked for ills
opinion of the situation as presented by
the distinguished visitor, said:
"To begin with I may state that the
question is really such a new one to us
fen a nation, arid to myself in particular,
that I rather hesitate to' express an opin
lon. Since y"ou have asked me what I
think I must confess that in my personal
ton Lord Beresford has come to us
as a missionary of England. Now it is
true that our Hritlsh cousins cannot see
a joke, but they are 'onto' the future
pr^at international questions before we
begun to be aware of theiF exist
ence.
"For my part I believe that Lord Beres
ford is perfectly honest in everything that
I express my opinion
a member of the Chamber of Com
merce it is then that J am aware that wfr
should proceed very cautiously and that
safeguard should be taken to see
that we are secured in everything that we
B8 a nation may do. There is no denying
thnt the trade of the East (s as yet In
its Infancy, ami that America certainly
controls the major Bhare of It. In this
l may state that I myself will
next month sail for <"hina and Japan to
l""k after the interests of mv company
there.
"When -we come to art as a nation it is
then that %vo have to proceed most care
fully. Too mv . ot be had,
find while Lord Beresford is undoubtedly
! t in all that he says, v.c should do as
England I him. send "our
own missionaries to Â«*hina and the East
to ascertain for us what is t lie exact con
dition of afSairs there. [ am in favor 01
the Chamber of < 'oniraf â â c of San Fran
rnllng a representative to
learn for us what is the prevailing con
dition of trade In that great country. Of
Be it might be a good plan for the
I'nited States to send a m< tnber from its
Associated Chambers. Hht for the pres
ent I am speaking for our own city. I
really have no plan that I can suggest
for dealing with the views presented by
Lord Beresford. I only know that our
most representative merchants agree With
him, but they only desire, so far as I
have been able to ascertain, some na
tional guarantee that what Lord Beres
ford gays is a correct presentation of the
farts in the case."

now Aged Mrs. Lena Guttzeit Tragically Vacated
Her Squalid Quarters. 7
* Â» T WILL go. out to-day,", was the
I â  reply of Lena Guttzeit in re
sponse to the sharp order
of her landlady, Mrs. Eva
Ferschland, of 345"? Third .street,
yesterday, forenoon. The woman,
who' is German by birth and aged
about 50 years, kept her word, but
not in the manner expected. She
had been living In a squallid hole
in-the-wall at the place named for
several months, but was unable to
obtain employment and was a pen
sioner on Mrs. Ferschland. - The lat
ter Is very poor and has three chil
dren to support. Her husband Is In
the army at Manila. It was under-
stood, that Miss Guttzeit would va
cate the premises by noon and she
carefully packed a trunk and box
preparatory to- leaving.
Having but 10 cents in her posses
sion and no place to go the unfortu
nate woman was 'evidently seized
with despair and decided to go- to
that country where there is* .sup
posed to be surcease from sorrows.
To this end she fastened a screw
hook in the top of the door casing
of her room, procured a piece of
clothesline, which she attached to
the hook, only to find that the door
.way was too low to enable her to
hang herself in the regulation way.
The customary box was there to
perform its duties, but the drop
could not be employed. So the de

ALL MONTHS
ALIKE TO THE
CLAIM BROKER
November Made to
Mean January.
| COULD NOT OVERREACH UNCLE
CONTRACT DRAWN TO OUTLAST
ALL ETERNITY.
Double-Action Orders on the Auditor
and Treasurer to Secure the
Payment of "Hocked"
j. ' Warrants.
i After waiting over three months for a
, portion of their salary 300 of the teachers
did not receive any pay. They had yield-,
; ed to necessity and the brokers got their
i warrants. Only the November claims
were sold, but a warrant-shaver would
i never dare look his 'Office clock in.the
face if he unsuccessfully went up against
so wild 'a game as a needy school teach
: er's salary, claim. Some of the employes
of the School Department who had real
: ized on their November expectations were
! In hopes that the January money was
| safe, but they had not read the printed
| agreement .on the orders and promissory
j notes .they signed. Consequently when
they- leisurely came to the Treasurer's of
fice last Monday they found themselves
too late. The salary had been paid' and
, there was nothing left but a receipt for
the money. â¢ â¢
. A business agreement with a warrant
broker is a steel-clad 'contract that will
outlive time itself. It oversteps the most
farreaching statute. of limitations and is
good for value received to the uttermost
bounds of eternity. When an impoverish
ed city employe goes to one of -' these
exceedingly commercial gentry to "hock"
a claim he or she must put in most of the
day signing the necessary papers. First
there Is an ordinary promissory note with
interest; second, another promissory note
secured by the claim on the city treas
ury; third, an- order on the secretary of
the Board of Education for the. warrant
when sighed; fourth, a duplicate order on
the Auditor, notifying thai official that
the amount of the claim has been hypoth
ecated; fifth, an order on the Treasurer
forbidding him to pay the same to any
j person except the accredited representa
i tive of the broker. * .
The order on the secretary Is to prevent
i the delivery of the signed warrant to the
j employe; the order on the Auditor is a
! check on the secretary, and the order to
! the Treasurer will finally catch the valu
able paper should it by chance slip away
â  from the other two officials. A warrant
shaver takes no chances.
Notwithstanding these precautions . a
| number of teachers who had sold ; and
'signed away their November claims hoped
j that the. broker's Interests therein, would
! be swallowed up in the last months of the
j year. The- long printed agreement which
they evidently aid not read states that
: they have assigned demands, claims- "for
the month? of November, 1898, and for all
succeeding months during the existence
of the loan, and that he (or she) agrees
to assign such demand until all said loans
and interest are fully paid." The em
ploye also appoints the broker, his attor
ney in fact Irrevocably for the prupose of
receiving such demands and . he author
izes and empowers said attorney in- fact
to sign his name to any warrant or order
for the delivery of the same "until all loans
and Interest are fully paid, and the. em
ploye Irrevocably directs the secretary of
the Board of .Education, the Auditor and
the Treasurer to draw/audit and pay the
amount of the warrant to the attorney in
fact. The assignee. of the claim also states
that the said warrant for November has
not -been sold or pledged to any other
person. â¢â¢ V â '..?' '

"handle in her hand, kneeled upon
tbe box, leaned against the door
and chimney, and forcing her
throat upon .the rope, slowly stran
gled herself to death.
A peculiar feature of the case was
the fact that there were none of the
usual signs of strangulation, the
victim appearing to have died from
natural causes and to have been
"placed in the position in which she
was found. The condition of the
body indicated that deceased had
hanged herself at the hour at which
she was supposed to leave the place
and had- kept her word so far as
departure was concerned.
- The remains were found about 2
o'clock. Deceased left no note giv
ing a reason for her act nor was
there a scrap of food in the place
sufficient to feed a mouse.
1 Auditor, and Treasurer were signed at
] the broker's office in blank by the teacher,
consequently it was easy to fill in any
! month at will. Some of the orders oh
j Bier & Regansburger hâd been made out
, for November, but the words "or Decem
ber or January" had been added, it is
; claimed. Indicating great -Cleverness on
i the part of those warrant 'shavers. But
I as their contract gave them an everlast
ing leadpipe' cinch on those claims this
I little trick of trade loses much of the pc
! culiarity of its character. To fall of their
January salary at- last is a hardship, in
deed, after the loss of November-Decem
ber" money", but those employes got one
month, less the broker's usury, out of
the? three, consequently they must be
satisfied. \ ?-Â»>.''
Almost all of the janitors had sold their
claims and. a number of the teachers who
i went to -their "uncles" were .lately placed

Assemblyman McDonald Sends Word
;> From Livermore That He Has
'.â. a Few Political Ideas
Ahead.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, Feb. 14.
All of the political parties will meet
this week and outline their plans for the
city campaign. It is agreed on. all sides
that a short active campaign is. better
for all concerned because it is realized
that a great deal of personal work must
be done, and that there is a limit to the
efforts of the candidates. .
To-morrow night the Republican City*
Central Committee will meet at Its head
quarters in the Blake & Moffltt building.
It ls probable that no public meetings will
be held Until the last two weeks prior to
March 13. The Democratic City Central
Committee has its headuarters at 456
Eighth street and will meet for business
to-morrow night. The Independents have
opened headquarters at 456 Eighth street
and will meet Thursday nights.
The Army and Navy League will hold
a meeting in Becker's Hall next Saturday
evening to consider the Indorsement of
candidates. The Afro-Americans will also
enter the field and the Pondinkeys have
already got to work.
All doubt regarding T. F. Garrity run
ning for . City Attorney was set at rest
this afternoon whan the chairmen of the
Independent Republicans and Democratic
conventions received communications
from him. He says: "At the time of
the convention I was confined to bed
by severe Illness, and although I have
repeatedly stated that I would not
accept any nomination I have concluded,
owing to the assurances of support that
have come to me from friends, irrespec
tive of party, to make an active campaign
for the offlce of City Attorney."
Assemblyman McDonald 'is looking a
long way ahead. He has sent word down
from Sacramento that he will be* a candi
date for Supervisor next year for the dis
trict now represented by Supervisor
Wells. The Socialist Labor party has is
sued its programme for the next quarter.
Commencing February 19 the Sunday lec
turers will be Austin Lewis, Dr. George
R. Dobson. Professor Charles E. Mark
ham, H. T. Tuck. M. W. Wilklns, Fred
E. Seybold, Clark D. Whittier, David
Starr Jordan, T. Beresford. and Edwin D.
Payne. '? ??'
D. J. Mullins, who was nominated by
the Independents for . Library Trustee,
has filed an affidavit with the City Clerk
that he Is not a candidate and was nom
inated without his consent.

CIAL QUESTIONS.
Marks on Lillian's Neck Not Made
by an Apron â Impressions
Gained at thÂ© In
quest.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Feb. 14.
"My God, that girl must have died a
thousand deaths!"
This was one of, the expressions of hor
ror uttered by J. M. McNulty, a Coro
ner's juryman at the Inquest on the death
of Lillian Brandes, November 19 last, and
to-day at the trial of the accused mur
derer, William A. Brandes, Mr. McNulty
repeated that statement. ' .â
The testimony adduced to-day proved
particularly damaging to any hopes that
the defense might entertain for saving :
the accused from expiating the crime of j
which he stands charged.
Witness McNulty told his story ln a j
cool, calm and definite manner, empha
sized by the determined efforts of the de
fense to trip him. He said that when I
the remains were viewed at Brandes' j
home, he had uttered the first mentioned
exclamation "because the body was so !
badly beaten up." "On the girl's' left arm
there were several small cuts, where the j
skin had been broken," continued witness.
"Some of the marks were such as you
have perhaps seen on a horse that has >
been beaten with a whip. On the lower I
limbs were many black and blue discolor
ations. In fact, the marks were pretty
well distributed over the whole front and
sides of the body. There were also some
on the head and face, as well as on the
palms of the hands, as if some one had
struck her." . * â¢
Attorney Bennett here asked: "The
Deputy Coroner, Strelgbtlf, testified, Mr.
McNulty, that her whole left side was
black and blue. Do you remember about
that?". But Judge Hall cut the attorney
short. "Now, this is just what we are
attempting to avoid," said his Honor. "At
your request witnesses were admonished
not to talk to each other about this case
and were excluded from the courtroom.
Now you tell the witness what some other
witness has -testified to."
Continuing, Mr. McNulty testified that
the marks on Lillian's body were stmila.
to those made on a man's skin by a kick.
Before the witness was excused, Juror
Philip Selben brought out a most impor
tant point.' He asked McNulty about
the marks on the neck. It being claimed
by. the defense that the girl had hanged
herself; and the Juror wished to- know
how the marks appeared.
"There was no swelling on the neck,"
replied McNulty. "It looked as though
the neck was burned, as though rubbed."
Almost the same question was asked by
Juror Seiben of Dr. Whitworth last Fri
day, and the doctor said that "the mus
cles of the neck were not contracted and
the features not distorted."
The next witness, Charles H. Townsepd,
who had also acted as a Coroner's Jury
man, also testified as to the appearance
.of the body as of one brutally beaten.
Regarding the marks about the neck,
witness' said:
â¢ "The apron could never have made
â¢those marks abput the, neck, because It
was too soft. We twisted up the apron
to see. The mark around the neck was
about three-eighths of an inch wide." -
"The mark looked 'as if some one had
drawn something back arid forth around
it; like rubbing," continued Witness
Townserid. .'â â¢â " *..-.--.
,W. - J. Mortimer, who ' als"b served on
the Coroner's jury, was next called and
his testimony was corroborative.
This morning J. S. Harvey, a partner
''of Brandes in the night watchman busi
ness at Berkeley, and who had a room at
the Brandes residence, reiterated in the
main the testimony given by him at the
preliminary hearing. Witness told of
having seen Lillian searching in the back
yard for a bottle of poison and $15 which,
he had het-rd, had been stolen: He also
graphically narrated having heard sounds
one night just prior to the death, as if a
child was being beaten in the room where
Brandes and Lillian were at the time.
The father's voice was threatening; that
,of the child pleading to. spare her punish
ment. Witness declared that the whip
ping-sounded like that of a leather strap
striking bare flesh.
The trial will be resumed to-morrow
morning at 9:30 o'clock.
NEEDHAM GOES FREE.
He and Mike Conway Not Held for
Bobbery..
OAKLAND, Feb. 14.â The preliminary
examination of Danny Neednanvthe pu
gilist and Mike Conway, on a charge of
robbery preferred by William Mullins Jr.,
a. mall contractor, was concluded before
Police Judge Smith to-day, and defend
ants were uiscnarged. â¢
Both of the accused, however, were se
verely rebuked by Prosecuting Attorney
Leach and Judge Smith before they were
released. Judge Smith declared that -he
felt satisfied in his own mind that Need
ham and Conway had taken ah undue
advantage of Mullins, . but that the evi
dence was not sufficiently strong to war
rant their being held for trial before the
Superior Court. * . >
His Honor also branded the testimony
of John Flynn as false. Flynn had or
iginally corroborated Mullins' story be
fore . the Prosecuting Attorney, but- his
memory seemed seriously impaired while
he was on the stand to-day. y':Yy
MRS . DOYLE IN ARMS.
j Still Objects to the Railroad's Signal
Tower.
OAKLAND, Feb. . 14.â Mrs. ! Luke Doyle
i is not yet' reconciled to the bay window
i tower which is being erected by the rail
| road company across the street from' her
: boudoir window.- ..y y.
This afternoon Mrs. Doyle had an open
conflict with the employes who are erect
ing the signal tower. It is necessary
apparently to operate a derailing switch
system from the tower to have certain
I signal posts and bits of mechanism placed
in different parts of the street. The un
suspecting workmen were busy this after
noon digging - a few . holes, when Mrs.
Doyle charged down upon them. Her.
particular points of attack were two
workmen who were preparing to erect
a post on the same corner on which her
house is situated. Mrs. Doyle declared
that It would be an outrage to erect a
post" so that a man could sit on the top
of it and only be a few feet from her
window. The â¢ workmen â¢ endeavored in
- vain to as-sure the lady that: the railroad
company had no intention of stationing a
man at the top of . the post, which was
merely for the purpose of supporting a
semaphore and a few wires.
This did not. satisfy Mrs. Doyle. She
took possession of the hole in the street
and defied- the workmen to place a post in
it as long as she was there. The work
men, not anxious to precipitate bloodshed,
were very courteous to the lady, and in
voked the assistance of a police officer
to induce her to withdraw.
Mrs. Doyle, after some persuasion, came
out of the hole and declared that she
would strive to obtain her desire through
legal means. The. City Council has al
ready given the railroad company author
ity to build a tower and operate a switch
system, so that it does not appear that
there is much opportunity for -redress by
Mrs. Doyle. It was the lady's husband
who appeared before the Council some
weeks ago and protested in vain against
the building of a bay window tower on
the opposite corner from his home. The
window is now built,- and Is in reality but
very little bigger than a bay window
erected on another corner, about which
there was no contention.
SANTA FE MAY GO
TO EMERYVILLE
F. , M. . SMITH HINTS AT SOME
MYSTERIOUS DEAL.
OAKLAND. Feb. 14.â F. M. Smith, the
borax manipulator, has returned to Oak
land from the East, and In an interview
has hinted that when Prank C. Havens of
: the Realty Syndicate returns next week
i he may have some information regarding
!an Important railroad deal. Mr. Smith
! will not discuss- details, but admits
J that Mr. Havens' visit was. on matters
) connected with railroad business. .
Some months ago The Call stated that
; many important transactions were being
â  considered in connection with the prop
erty around Emeryville and that â¢ Mr.
: Smith was negotiating with tlje Santa Fe
i Company by which that corporation can
] secure a - terminal in the north end of
j town.
"I can't talk definitely at this time,"
said Mr. Smith; "but the option now held
by the Realty Syndicate has expired, and
we are considering new plans. There is
no doubt that there will be a ferry system
from Emeryville as an allied corporation
to the Realty Syndicate. We have had
plans prepared, and it is not likely that
our lines will always be a feeder for the
Southern Pacific ferrv-. Our manager,
Mr. Havens will return shortly, and he
will know just how far these projects
have progressed. The borax deals we
have made will not affect the Alameda
refinery. That will run as usual and* may
be enlarged." .* ?."."- -.-â¢â¢-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 15, 1899.
JOE MUSSLE
A WINNER ON
HIS STRENGTH
Outlasted Cavallo and
Wyoming,
A 100 TO 1 SHOT IN THE RING
FEBBIEB WON . A PECULIAB
LOOKING BACE.
Bey del Tierra First in "Bag-time."
Caldwell "Was Good to Allyar.
Three Favorites Were De- N
feated at Ingleside.
Just an ordinary rank outsider in j the
betting, Joe. Mussle, caused quite a ripple
of excitement at Ingleside yesterday. Joe.
with a colored brat- named Bas6ingeT on
hi. back, was a starter in the third re
cital, a seven-furlong jaunt,? and one or
two â¢ layers of ' prices chalked ' 100 to 1
against his name. Forty and fifty to one,
though, was fancy enough for most of the
books. Basslnger, with his mount, was
away, none too well, but managed to tele
phone both Wyoming, the favorite, and
Cavallo, another 'outsider, ln ; the last
stages, and won like a real good one.
Wyoming, lookin-*-' all over a winner, re
sponded to one bell and didn't get two
more in time to. beat Cavallo for. the
place, Quite a number of tickets were
cashed over the victory. of the long shot.
This was about the. only striking feature
of the day's doings. Incidentally, three
favorites were rocKed to sleep a common
occurrence. It is probable the talent and
books broke about even., y : ?i
There was nothing to the two-year-old
dash- but Ed Corrigan.'s entry, Sardine.
The daughter of Bassetlaw * was a pro
nounced favorite, and won under reefed
sails, stepping the three furlongs in 0:36"^.
Mountebank, under Piggott's hard' urging,
took the place from Tar Hill.
Duke & Wishard's colt Stamina received;
the passover in the betting on the mile
selling event, and won * hands down at
odds of 4 and 5 to 1. Strongoll led for.
over half the distance and then collapsed
completely. Stamina assumed the lead,
winning easily from Merops, an outsider.
Balllsta, the favorite, ran well to the
stretch turn, where he was interfered
with by Strongoll, and went to pieces. .
The capture of the seven-furlong run,
fourth on the card, will "Dear a little pep
per and salt. Hobart's horse undoubt
edly received the appointment, and 'with
assistance won out cleverly from Joe Ull
man. The latter was pounds the' best,
but was taken out of the running the first'
part by Rutter to last place. The favor
ite, Imperious, ran unplaced. : The win
ner was quietly backed at odds of 3 to 1.
The mile and a furlong purse event was
a procession. Hey del Tierra, with Bull
man up, took the lead at the start, fol
lowed by Topmast and Espionage, and
they finished in that order. The latter
received no ride whatever. Morlnel was
the only other starter.
In the closing chapter, Allyar, the odds
on choice, was in receipt of a catapult
start, and never landed until he struck
the wife, five lengths ahead of Ed Gart
land. Sombre was third.

HE WAVED HIS GILDED WAND
AND DULL CARE VANISHED
Brian. Assemblage Heeds Prince
Carnival's Injunction and Makes
Merry at the Mardi Gras Ball.
WITH a wave of his glided wand
Prince Carnivalâ who in the se
clusion of private life is known
as plain Jack Wilsonâ set the en
tire machinery of the great Mardi Gras
ball in motion last night and made the
vast and brilliant throng assembled at
the Art Institute forget for the nonce
that there was such a thing as care and
trouble and woe.
Gaj-ety reigned supreme. Laughter and
jollity and the ever accompanying merry
jest and brilliant repartee held full sway,
and the mischievous spirit of the carni
val tide was over it all.
Unlike the preceding ball of two years
ago society ruled it was right and proper
that all, even including the tender bud,
should attend. The mandate of the lead
ers was obeyed to the very letter of the
law, and if one prominent name should be
be found missing from the list of those
present there is but one excuse a typo
graphical error.
The poor little pages of Tivoli renown,
pretty Irene Duval and Miss Davis, came
and saw, performed their little part, con
quered and went. They posed pictur
esquely In skin-fitting pink tights, stood
beside his Majesty of Misrule and lightly
held between dainty fingers the hem of
.he kingly garment. Then, their work
done, Green-way, resplendent in blue and
silver and plumes, a wicked, rather ma
ture Don Juan, led them to the supper
table, after which they received proper
escort to their respective homes.
The arrangements of the ball were per
fect. Greenway Introduced several In
novations, one of which was having the
vise committee serve in relays. . Those
â who sacrificed themselves to the cause in
the early part of the evening had the
best of it. Horace Piatt's turn came late
and when the ball was at its height the
poor vise man stood shivering in the cor
ridorâa martyr to his aristocratic cause.
It was intended that the grand march
start at 0 o'clock sharp, but the guests,
though not ultrafashionably late in ar
riving, lingered in the brilliantly decor
ated rooms and cozy nooks, and it was
well on to 30 o'clock when the Herald's
magic call summoned all to attend his
Majesty.
The Prince gave greeting in clear, crisp
tones, his jester emphasizing with merry
steps the points His Majesty had spent
many sleepless night to make.
Thus spake the Lord of Misrule:
My fair, grotesque and merry subjects,
I, your King. Prince of the Carnival, Lord
of Misrule. Abbot of Unreason and Ruler
of the Revels, do greet you, one and all.
And now hearken to my royal mandate.
First of all. I order that ye rejoice,
make merry, exult, clap your hands, twirl
your heels, sing, carol and frolic to your
hearts' content or somebody else's heart's
content.
Secondly, I order that ye be, one and all,
in high feather, gay as larks, brisk as
bees, playful as kittens and merry as
grigs.
For here shall he no thought of Care,
1 give yen all a warning.
Who can b for Care?
Not I, I sweat-;
With laughter loud
We'll weave his shroud.
And bury him In the morning.
This being attended to I command that
Each man's heart shall so Incline
To make some maid his Valentine.
For this is the Saint's day, and all men
must on this day above all others honor
all women.
For woman is a happy thought,
And without her man Ie nought.
A cipher. in fact; let each man there
fore sigh for a woman, and when she is
â won, as won she may be, let him follow
her till the sum is done. For nought fol
lowing one makes ten, and ten. as the
ancient astrologers held, is the sum of all
human happiness. Ergo, woman is but
another name for a man's happiness, and
any man who lacks the wit to apprehend
this simple rule of two and profit by It,
why let him grow long ears and sing
songs to a thistle. And any man who
ST. VALENTINE BRINGS MISSIVES OF LOVE TO ALL.
CHAUNCEY O'BRIEN, letter carrier.
Is going to petition Congress to pass
an act fixing the postage on valen
tines at $4 each.
"It'll either stop this damfoolishness or
It'll raise revenue enough to meet the
deficiency and pay off the war debt." so
liloquized Chauncey. as he staggered along
yesterday under a load that would have
broken the back of a mule.
"That's twenty-one lye delivered to
â¢__JldrÂ«d Shaughnessy," he continued to
falls to swear a maid be pretty whether
she is or no; or any man who doth refuse
the challenge of glancing eye or am
bushed smile; or any man who loves a
maid and tells her not. for bashfulness or
lack of wit to make the opportunity, it is |
my royal will that he be declared unfitted
for our revels, and that he be scourged
hence with whips of darning cotton. '
And as for ye, ladlesâ but. hold, I
shrewdly suspect that ye need no In
structing. Only remember tnat
This Is the night of St. Valentine,
When Cupid is out at play,
And if he would borrow a glance of thine
To use as an arrow, sweet Valentine,
Do not say him nay, nay, nay;
Oh, do not say him nay.
And . .
Now on with the dance;
â¢ Let merriment hold sway
Until the sentinel dawn
Doth signal envious day.
After His Majesty's little say. Jester
Hellman and his fetching partner, Mrs.
Clover, demonstrated to a breathless, gid
dy world what they could do in the cake
walk line; then a stalwart lieutenant led
the "American Flag" into the enticing
meshes of the waltz and the ball was on.
To dainty, dashing Miss Marie Wells
The Mad Whirl of Masked Revelers
went the highest honors of the ball. Miss
Wells was the first to break the impres
sive silence after the Prince's speech. To
the Mayor went the fetching little lady.
"How-dy'-do," said the belle. Â-""-*
"Who are you?" said the Mayor.
"Mrs. Hobson." .
"Where's your husband?" '
"Left him," laconically said the little
beauty, "because he would not kiss me!"
Great variety prevailed In the costumes
of the ladies, but the gentlemen who ap
peared ln other than the regulation suit
etiquette demands were few and far be
tween. â¢ â 
The decorations were superb and in
keeping with the mad spirit of the affair.
Yellow and red. the carnival's colors,
were seen everywhereâ ln the brilliant
lights, in the soft, full draperies and even
in the valentines that hung in the midst
of all ' the carnival splendor. Masques
were also used with striking effects, and
grotesque faces peered from out a mass
of coloring from odd and unexpected
places. In the conservatory red lights
and potted ferns made the home of the
exotics an enticing place for the lovers
of uninterrupted little chats.
In the dining-room amid a wealth of
palms and brilliant coloring the following
menu was served by Caterer Wheeler and
his men: -.;"? ;

"Whatever them monkeys can see in that

rier toiled up the hill to the next house.
But though the Postoflice people could
find no joy In the annual visit of the love

happiness from the day. And there were

Every school and nearly every class had
Its postmaster or postmistress, on whom
devolved the duty of distributing the gay
cards. The teachers as a rule were fairly
loaded down with these tokens, while now
and then one of the kind called "comics"
was surreptitiously slipped into the post
office by the bad boy of the class, who
thus availed himself of his one oppor
tunity to let his teacher know what his
real sentiments toward her were.
