BLOODSHED
AND RIOTING
AT WARDNER
Masked Strikers Wreck
Mining Property With
Dynamite.
WARDNER, Idaho, April 29.â One thousand
masked and heavily armed miners reached here
at noon to-day on a Northern Pacific train they
had stolen at Burke. They brought with them
a ton and a half of dynamite. Three hours
later they departed on the stolen train, leav
ing the 8300.000 mill, the office and the board=
ing house of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mines a
total wreck. The machinery and brick building
had been shattered to bits by the explosion of
immense charges of dynamite, and the frame
buildings had been consumed by fire, the miners
having applied the torch to them.
SPOKANE, April 29. â Another
d< adly, property-destroying riot
among the miners of the Coeur
d" Alone District in Idaho took
, place to-day and adds a dark
page to the record of the district.
In which the memory of the bloody days
of 1592 ami 1*54 still lingers. This time
the property of the inker Hill and
Sullivan mine at Wardner has suffered.
The mine is owned by D. O. Mills, the
McCprmack estate and others of San
Francisco. F. W. Bradley of that city
Is president of the company. Ten mil
lion dollars is the value <if the mine.
Governor Steunenberg of Idaho has
called on President McKinley lor 500
Federal troops to aid in checking toe
riots and preserving peace.
One thousand masked and hea % '" v
armed miners reached Wardner, irMho,
at noon to-day on a Northern Pacific
train they had stolen at Burk-'- They
brought with them a ton an^ a half
of dynamite. Three hours l^t-er they
departed on the stolen train, leaving ]
the 5300,000 mill, the off'oe* and the
hoarding-h^use of the BuiiHoi Hiil and
Sullivan mine a total wreck. The ma
chinery and brick building had been
shattered to bits by the explosions of ;
immense charges of dynamite and the
frame buildings had been consumed by
flre, the miners having applied the torch !
A startling incident was a short but
severe interchange of shots between
two parties' of the armed rioters, each
party believing the other wag non
union miners. As a result of the shoot
ing one of the rioters, "Jack" Smith,
was killer]. Two other men, J. J. Rog
ers, a. stenographer, and James Cheyne,
of the mill, were wounded. Cheyne was
phot in the hip, a probably fatal wound.
Rogers was shot in the lip.
The leaders in the riot-in fact the
chief participantsâ were union miners
from Burke, Gem and other Canyon
Creek mining camps, who had no direct
Interest in the diinculties between the
Wardner miners and the Bunker Hill
and Sullivan management. The union
miners of Wardner, however, partici
pated in the rioting and aided in de
stroying the property which gave them
their living. The destruction of the mill
means the closing of both the Bunker
Hill and Sullivan and the Last Chance
mines for months, until new mill can
be erected. These are the chief mines
at Wardn< and their closing will throw
1000 men out of employment.
The stolen train was that which car
ries passengers daily from Burke to
Wallace over Hie North* Tl acih"r:. The
armed mob "took possession at Burke.
At the point of pistols it compelled a
train crew to co-uple nine box â â wh to
the passenger coach, and then compell
ed the engineer to start for Wallace.
Every car was crowded with - -r*ed and
masked men. At Wallace a brief stop
was made, accessions being made to the
ranks of the rioters. Here the North
ern Pacific joins the Oregon railroad.
The train. was switched to the latter
tracks and proceeded to Wardner at
full speed, reaching that city at about
noon.
From the depot a small party was
sent toward the mine, two miles away,
while the main body, after a discussion
with the striking Wardner miners, pro
ceeded toward the mill, a half-mile
away. One of the advance party on
the hillside fired a shot as a signal that
the mill and mine were deserted. The
signal was misunderstood by the main
body of strikers, who poured a volley
of nearly 1000 rifle shots into the under
brush on the hillsides behind which
the advance party was concealed. Be
fore the error as discovered Smith
fell, fatally shot in the throat. While
some of the rioters carried, his body to
the depot, others took to the mill sixty
fifty-pound kegs of powder the rioters
had brought on the train. Heavy
charges were placed amid the mill ma
chinery and about the mill and under
the brick office building; fuses were af
fixed and lighted, the torch was ap
plied to the frame boarding house
buildings and then the rioters returned
to the hillsides, whence a view of the
expected explosions could be had.
Six terrific explosions soon followed,

The mine management had early
warning of t>? approach of the mob. i
The non-uÂ»Â» lon miners left the mine
several h'" urs before the train arrived
and to* X to the woods, where they re

manager instructed the mill employes
t^iat the company desired no one to i
cake chances by attempting to pre
serve the company's property, so the
mill was deserted early in the day.
Governor Steunenberg of Idaho is Be
riously ill at Boise, but is exerting him
self to meet the situation. Early this
afternoon he wired to President Me ,
Kinley, advising him of the serious -,
trouble and of the probable need of
troops. After learning of the blowing â 
up of the mill he made a 'ormal call for j
Â£00 soldiers to be sent to the ecenif-^C i
once. i '-" r â -â>*'
Judge Beatty of the Federal Court six
years ago issued a perpetual injunc
tion restraining members of the Min
ers' Union from entering upon or inter- \
fering with the Bunker Hill and Sulli- i
van property. The violation of this
Injunction is one ground for calling for
Federal aid to quell the rioters. When
first issued the - injunction was the i
means of calling the Twenty-fifth
United States Infantry Into the Coeur
d'Alenes, where it long remained pro
tecting the mine.
To-night there arrived in Spokane a
number of refugees from Wardner. I
They report that when last seen Super
intendent Burbridge of the Bunker Hill
and Sullivan was "hitting the trail"
over the hills, evidently intending to !
strike a railroad at some remote point.
These refugees refuse to talk for pub
lication, having a deadly fear of the j
strikers, who have representatives
here. They bring a number of shells |
from the cartridges fired by the strik
ers to-day. Curiously enough, they are |
from cartridges used in Springfield
rifles, seventy-five of which were stolen
from a militia company's armory at
Mullen two years ago and never recov
ered.
One company of the Twenty-fourth
United States Infantry (colored) is sta
tioned at Spokane and another at Van
couver Barracks. No orders have been
received here for the movement of the
troops.
The strike in the Bunker Hill and
Sullivan began last Monday, when the
union men, who were in the majority
on the list of the company's employes,
demanded an advance of pay and a
recognition of the union. They had
been paid $3 a day for miners and $2 50
a day for muckers. Their demand was
for a half-dollar advance in each class.
The company signified its willingness
to pay th( increased wage, which was
based on the advance in lead and sil
ver, which the mines produced, but de..
clined to recognize the union. All the
union men were thereupon withdrawn.
The non-union men were retained and
more engaged. On Tuesday and Wed
nesday the union men walked up the
hill to reiterate their demands and to
talk to the non-union men. On Wed
nesday, while on a similar' visit, T. S.
Murray, one of the leaders of the strike,
drew a revolver and others threatened
to do so. They Intimidated a number
of union men into quitting. Thus the
strike dragged along until to-day,
when the other union miners in the |
Coeur d Alenes swept down from Can
yon Creek, the hotbed of agitation and
Incendiarism, and started the trouble
L- n Â£m aSt Chance mi ne, near the Bun
ker Hill and Sullivan, which was pay-
Tig the union scale, but not recogniz
ing the union, closed on the commence
ment of the trouble on Monday, but
was allowed by the union to resume,
although it did not recognize the un
ion, a dispensation being made in its
favor because It always paid the union
scale. It will now have to close be
cause of the destruction of the mill
used in common by the two.

MANILA, April 29, 3 p. m.â The

Argueleses and Lieutenant Jose
Bornal, -,vho came from General
Luna under a flag of truce yesterday to
ask for a cassation of hostilities, was
fruitless. The Filipinos admit that they

Mr. Schurman emerged from the pal
between the two shock-haired, half
looking emissaries, and the
. three drove unattended to the office of
the United States Philippine Commis
sion, where they talked informally for
about an hour.
Manila is divided between two opin
the majority believing that the
I Filipinos desire peace, while others
â  think they are sparring for time in
v to rehabilitate their demoralised
army. The latter opinion gained color
from the fact that reinforcements have
been sent to the south, opposite the
American lines.
c .lonel Argueleses, who is a lawyer,
aptly illustrated the Malay subtlety at
words. While he declared with appar
ent frankness that the Filipino leaders
want a chance to give up the struggle
gracefully through the Congress, in
stead of surrendering ignominiously, he
asked for a fortnight's armistice, so
that the Congress might be summoned
on May 1. He endeavored to commit the
Americans to greater concessions and
wanted terms guaranteed by treaty.
He was told that the recognition of the
Filipino Government was impossible,
and he was told that a written guar
antee of amnesty for all insurgents was
the utmost that could be given. Col
onel Argueleses argued that Spain had
given similar guarantees and broken
them, and he laid much stress on the
Spaniards' honor. He persistently de.
dared that the Filipinos must be per
mitted to retire with honor.
In conversation with Mr. Schurman,
Colonel Argueleses revived the question
of independence and was referred to
the statement in the Commissioners'
proclamation that the Filipinos would
l>e given an increasing measure of self
nunent as soon as they proved
themselves worthy of it.
Mi. Bchurman warned Argueleses
that the longer war was waged and the
more were killed, the stronger would
be the animosities hindering an amica
ble co-operation between the two peo
ples for the prosperity of the islands.
The insurgents have an insurrection
on th( it hands. The Maccabebes. tra
ditional foes of the Tagals, are rising
in the north, while the burden of thou
sands of hungry and discontented peo
ple who fled before the American army,
and who are camping behind the Fili
pino lines, multiplies the troubles of
the Filipino Government, the headquar
ters of which is now at Isidro, having
been moved northward when Caluinpit
I fell.
CLAIM NEGOTIATIONS
ARE UNOFFICIAL
LONDON, April 29.â Members of the
Filipino Junta here made the statement
to the Associated Press correspondent
to-day that the peace negotiations be
tween the United States authorities at
Manila and General Luna were unoffi
cial in character. General Luna, the
Junta asserts, does not represent Agul
naldo's government. It is further as
serted by the Junta that secret nego
tiations between Don C. Worcester of
the United States Philippine Commis
sion and a representative of AguinaMo
have been in progress since before the
attack on Malolos. The following con
ditions, it is alleged, were proposed

after the capture of Malolos:
"The Americans to issue a proclama
tion granting: the Filipinos self-govern
ment and police, civil and religious
rights similar to those enjoyed by the
people of Canada; the Filipinos to con
trol International mercantile relations;
Americans and Filipinos to enjoy equal
rights in the Islands; Manila to remain
in the possession of the United States
until Congress decides otherwise; the
American llag to fly over the capitols of
the islands, and in the most prominent
positions along with the Filipino flag,
except at Manila, where only the Amer
ican flag should fly; all vessels to My
the American flag with that of the
Filipinos; the American and Catholic
clergy to be under the same adminis
tration.as in the United States; Span
ish clerical direction and intervention
to be abolished; the status quo of rural
proaerty belonging to the religious or
ders to be maintained without return
to the ante-bellum state of affairs; hos
pitals and schools formerly adminis
tered by the orders to be handed over
to the government, the orders to retain
only their present town property; the
Becular clergy to retain their property."
The Junta asserts that Aguinaldo, in
view of these proposals, withdrew from
Malolos, hut that General Otis' procla
mation after the occupation of Malolos
failed to grant self-government on the
proposed lines. This, it is further as
serted, caused the hostilities following
the capture of Malolos.

IT is but a few days less than a year
Btnca the battle of Cardenas Bay. to the
Americans the most disastrous naval
engagement of the war. The only officer
killed in the brief struggle with Spain fell
in that fight, and with him fell four sea
menâmore than the dead of Manila and
Santiago combined. They were all killed
by the explosion of a single shell, and
now the startling statement is made that
the death-dealing missile came from an
American ship of war, sped by an Ameri
can gun and sighted by some loyal but
erring American seaman.
There is hitter feeling between the rev
enue marine service and the navy. Ft
has smoldered for neatly a year, but the
revenue service, according to its nwn [.tu
ple, has not been given the credit due for
the part it took in the war, and its offi
cers see no reason to spare their brothers
of the navy or to hide the mistakes they
made. "JBagley wan killed by a shell
from the Wilmington," is the direct state
ment of Lieutenant Hutchinson Scott, ex
ecutive officer of the Hudson during the
fatal fight, and he was looking into the
eyes of the doomed officer when the shell
laid him and his shipmates dead on the
deck of the little torpedo-boat.
The statement has called forth vigor-
oils denials from the commanding officer
of the Wilmington and from the officers
who were on board during the fight and
from those who sympathize with them;
but Scott adheres to his statement, and
his brut her officers will not deny BUCb a
happening was possible. The story has
caused much excitement in the East, and
now interest has been transferred in part
out here by the arrival of Lieutenant
Meade, who was an officer of the Hudson
during the fight.
' The question has been considered by the
Navy Department, but it has been de
cided to make no formal investigation.
The denial of Captain Todd of the Wil
mington and the added statements of
Lieutenant Bernadou, who commanded
the Winslow, that his men were killed
by a Spanish shell have been taken as
sufficient; but the revenue officers call at
tention to the positions of the three ves
sels during the engagement, to the cir
cumstances surrounding the death of the
men and the fearful effect of the bursting
projectile, and then leave the matter to
the judgment of those who hear. Scott
is the only one who says outright that
"Bagley was killed by a shell from the
Wilmington."
The battle was fought on May 12, LB9B.
For weeks before the American vessels
had been blockading the bay of Cardenas,
and they had been annoyed by the audac
ity of three small light-draught Spanish
gunboats that would run out from the
shallow harbor, dart around the cays
until they sighted the waiting warships
and then scurry in again like frightened
chickens, while their pursuers, of heavier
draught, could not follow them In the
shoals of the channels. It was too much
for Commander Meade of the Machias.the
senior officer of the blockading squadron,
and he ordered the Wilmington, the Hud
son and the Wlnslow into the harbor to
find and, if possible, destroy the Spanish
vessels. The "Wilmington was a gunboat
drawing nine feet of water; the YV'in.slow

pounders and drawing six feet, and the

cers of the revenue marine and carrying
two G-pounders, one forward and one aft.
The Hudson drew a few inches less than,
the Wilmington, or about eight and a
half Xeet.
Cardenas Bay is an irregularly formed,
bit of shoal watrr with its opening near
ly closed by a narrow neck of land
stretching from what would have been
the western head of the bay to the east
ward. The channel should have opened to
the north, but the narrow strip turned,
it to the east and in coming out it is near
ly to the east that a vessel must head.
Ev.en then the channel is cut up by two
cays into three passage ways, only one of
which is considered safe. This was the
channel to the west, r ind th,'s the Spanish
had thickly planted with mines. The pas
ln the middlo between the two cays
w,is too shallow and there was a chance
through the channels to the eastward.
The thref vessels took the chance and
aft* r carefully soundinar the eastern chan
nel they entered the 'oay.
The hay is about nine miles from north
to south and ;is much from east to west.
The town of Cardenas ties on its south
ern shore and to the west Prom the
east a shoal runs out Into the bay almost
I to a point off the town and just in front
of the town is the best anchorage. Ona
and three-quarter faihoms, or less than
eleven feet of water is the rule off the
city, and this deepen? to two. two and a
half and three fathoms farther out in,
the hay.
With the Wisslow on her port bow and
a little ahead of her and the Hudson in
the same relative position on her star
bcard bow, the "Wilmington steamed slow
ly through the channel and then turning?
to the westward ran coward the center of
the bay. Arriving there she turned to
the south, and while shf> steamed still
more slowly down coward the town her
commander ordered 'he Hudson to run
X the west and the Wlnslow to the east
and, turning, to skirt the shore and hoth
sides of the town in the hope of sighting
the gnnboats.
The weather was not clear and thÂ«
Shore could not be reconnoitred from a.
great distance, so the two little vessels
ran in to within two thousand yards of
the land and then worked round parallel
to it, the Winslow >i3Bing close to tha
outer edge of the shoal that reached out
from the east side of the bay.
The task of the Hudson was nearly
completed. She had skirted the shore
from the western side of the bay to just
off the city, where, a mile -out. lay two
merchant ships at anchor. As she reached
them phe heard firing off to the other
side of the city and immediately after
the Winslow ran out of the haze with her
one-pounders spitting viciously and tha
water all about her cut by the Spanish
shells. She had found the gunboats
moored to the stone quays with nothing
but bow or stern visible, and thus pro
tected they opened fire on her as soon
as they saw she had approached as near
as she dared. It was the fire of the gun
boata that informed her of their position,
and being little more than half a. mile
from them she turned out into the bay
and taking position at a range of about
two thousand yards she came into action.
In the meantime the Wilmington had
arrived off the city and was lying out
about thirty-five hundred yards. She
could not distinguish the gunboats, but
she could see the shore, and as soon as2
the Winslow came under fire she drew '
in a little more and brought her battery
of five-Inch guns to bear. The Hudson
turned out at once when her captain
heard the puna going , and passing be
tween the two merchant vessels lie ran
over to the Wilmington for orders. He
was ordered to close in and join the
action, and he did so, taking a position
â¢in line with the Wlrislow.
Thus situated the three vessels kept up
a rapid fire until the men on the Hudson
noticed that something was wrong with
the steering sear of the Winslow. A hail
to her met the reply that she -was all
right. A few minutes after something
more serious happened to the Winslow'a
steering gear and she seemed to have lost
the control of her helm altogether, but
still her commander, Lieutenant Berna
dou, kept in the light. He could steer
with his engines he said.
Then came thi linal injury to the tor
pedo boat. A shell took her in the waist
and entered one of her boilers, and she
lay helpless with her engines powerless.
Then she signaled the Hudson and asked
to be towed out of the Jieree rain of shell
that was falling about her. All through
the action she had been the principal tar-
Cet for the Spanish gunners, and they
eeemed bent on destroying her at least
before the tight ended.
The Hudson drew alongside in a direc
tion calculated to run her across the
Wlnslow's bows. There was barely
enough water to float tne tug where the
Winslow lay, and she had to maneuver
very carefully to avoid the fatal mistake
of getting aground while directly under
fire. Lieutenant Scott was in command
of her after six-pounder., and Lieutenant
Ern< st Meade of her forward gun, and
while Meade took charge of the battery
Scott mounted the low rail of the reve
nue boat and with a heaving line in his
hand awaited his opportunity,
As the Hudson ran past the Winslow he !
hove his line, but it was too short, and
the weighted < nd fell In the water some
yards from the -â â â â .--.- side. Uagley
â was waiting for the line. li. and Seotr
were old friends, and he sung out to the
revenue officer across the narrow retch I
of water between them, "For God's sake,
get us out of that fellow's tire!" and Scott
answered, "Keep your shirt on, old man!
We'll get you out In a minute." Whether
It was the fire of the Spaniards or the
lire of the Wilmington, lying just beyond
them, Scott did not know.
The Hudson backed down again on the
do-boat. She worked slowly and
cautiously, and Scott, with the log line
bent on the heaving line to make it long
er, waited for another chance. The
Hudson was coming toward the Winslow
istern first, or nearly so. The Winslow
â was tying with her bow to the .-si.
bringing her port side to the shore and
her starboard side out. Standing by the
one-pounder on her starboard rail was
Bagley and his gun's crew. He was
â watching Scntt. and was standing with
his back to the Spanish batteries and his
face, toward the Hudson and the Wil
mington. His men were faced as he
"was. They were looking right into Scott's
eyes and he was poising "himself for a
throw, when he saw the Hash of a burst-
Ing shell right among the men on the
Winslow.
He saw Bagley's face disappear; saw
the front of his body torn open from his
â¢waist to his hair and the bleeding trunk
hurled back across the narrow deck of
the torpedo-boat, until it lay an unrec
ognizable mass among the men with
whom he had stood but a minute before;
saw the men grouped around the gun |
thrown backwards, their faces crushed
and torn and themselves stretched on
their backs all over the decks, and but
one fell nearÂ«the rail. The others were
all blown inward and toward the shore
side of the vessel, each with the marks
of the explosion upon hi.s face, while their
backs, which had been toward the Span
ish guns, were uninjured.
It took twenty minutes of careful ma
neuvering to finally pass the line and then
it broke, but the disabled vessel was final
ly towed out of danger. By this time the
Wilmington had Bet the recall signal and
was herself making for the open sea. Sig
nals were, made on the Winslow and the
Hudson to notify her of their predicament
and of the need of assistance for
the wounded, but as none of the
Fignals were! answered the captain

SURGEON DISPLAYS
WONDERFUL NERVE
Completes an Operation After His
Rather Falls Dead at
His Side.
CHICAGO, April 29. â There was a tragic scene at the Hahnemann
pital this afternoon, when Dr. Reuben I^udlam, aged 6S years,
â lent of Hahnemann College and dean of the faculty, dropped
dead while performing a delicate surgical operation, and his son,
who was assisting him, was compelled, with steady nerve, to com
plete the operation.
Dr. Ludlam's death occurred at 5 o'clock. The venerable surgeon had
recently recovered from a long sickness, the result of a surgical opera
tion, and the operation to-day was one of the first he had attempted since
his recovery. It was a case of hysterotomy for the removal of fibroid
tumor, and the operation took place in tho private operating-room. Dr.
Ludlain apparently was in the best of spirits and his hand never had
been more steady nm- his brain more clear. The operation was half com
pleted, when he uttered an exclamation of distress, the knife dropped
from his fingers and he sank unconscious Into a chair.
His son, Dr. Reuben Ludlam Jr., wh<> was assisting him, glanced, at
his father, over whose face the pallor of death was gathering, then at
the patient on the operating chair, and instantly took up the work
where his sire had left off, while attendants carried the venerable phy
sic ian to another room and Bummoned Dr. Halbert and Dr. George F.
Shears. They applied restoratives and did all they could, but in a few
moments the last sign of life disappeared.
M- tntime his son completed the operation with care and skill,
though suffering under terrible suspense. The operation was wholly
successful and the life of the patient was saved. The remains of Dr.
Ludlam were conveyed to his home at 1523 Michigan avenue.
The death of Dr. Ludlam will bÂ» learned with the deepest regret
throughout the country- He stood at the head of surgeons in the
homeopathic field. He had been connected with Hahnemann College
since Its establishment, thirty-nine years ago, and over 2500 physicians
throughout the country have his signature upon diplomas. The faculty
of every homeopathic college west <>f the Alleghenies contains professors
who earned theijr degrees under Dr. L,udlam's tutelage, for Hahnemann
is the pioneer homeopathic college of the "West.
backs, that they wore blown backward on
the ileclt. not forward over the side, and
that shells were bursting around the
Wlnslow in a manner to indicate that the
lire i>? the Wilmington was reaching herâ
all th:s is clte'l to support Lieutenant
Scott's blunt statement, "Bagley was
killed by ;i shell fr^m the Wilmington."
The affair has created the greatest ex
citement among the naval people of the
Eafit, where the story is already out, and
the relations between the navy and the
revenue marine are all the more strained.
It Is not likely that the question will ever
be settled, for the department will take
no action, and there is left only the state
ment of Scott, in whose sight the tragedy
was enacted, the denials of the naval of
ficers who were in the battle and watched
the general course of events and the atti
tude of the nthf-r revenue cutter officers,
who, while not saying Scott is right, re
fuse to say he is wrong 1 .
COLLEGE FOR YOUNG
WOMEN CATHOLICS
Meeting Held to Further the Build
ing an Annex to the Univer
sity at Washington.
NEW YOPJv, April 29.â 1t is proposed to
establish a woman's college for young wo
men of the Catholic faith which shall be
to the Catholic University of Washington,
D. C, what Bernard College is to Colum
bia University and Radcliffe College to
Harvard University. To discuss and fur
ther this important movement a meeting
was held In this city at whic.i many prom
inent Catholics, both clerical and lay,
were present, with Arcnbishop Corrigan
presiding. , ;-;
It was announced by former Judge
Daly that forty acres 01 ground adjacent
to the university in Washington have been
secured for the new female annex, and
that the institution would be named Trin
ity College, and would be under the guid
ance and control of the Sisters of Our
Lady of Namur. 1â¢, - iJ '
Archbishop Corrigan said Trinity Col
lege was so line and sure in conception
and design thai from every point of view
it was moSt creditable to those- who were
pushing its plans forward. . The Arch
bishop also suggested that the Idea might
appeal to those without as well as to those
within the church.
Great enthusiasm indicative of success
pervaded the entire meeting, and it was
made certain that New York and rich
Catholic interests represented here are
quite ready to do a fair share toward
making: Trinity College the grand success
its founders and promoters hope to see
it attain.

LAURA MILLARD'S
EXCITING CHASE
Mounted on a Bicycle, She Bides
After a Thief Until Her Stolen
Watch Is Recovered.
CHICAGO, April 29.â Laura Millard
of the Castle Square Opera Company
had an exciting six-mile chase this j
afternoon after a thief who had her
diamond-studded watch, given her by
San Francisco admirers when she was
sharing honors with Alice Neilson in
the Tivoll in that city. Miss Millard
arrived in the city last night and had
worked hard all the morning rehears
ing for the part she is to take in the
"Gypsy Baron." This afternoon she
sought relaxation in a bicycle ride.
On the way back to the hotel, when
near Park Row and Michigan avenue,
she looked at her watch, and in at
tempting to return it to her belt it
dropped.
She stopped as quickly as she could,
but not 60 quickly as a boy. also on
a wheel, who, without dismounting,
picked up the bauble and started south
on the boulevard as fast as he could
go. Miss Millard did not waste any
wind shouting after him. but climbing
on her wheel, gave chase. She could
not overhaul the nervy youngster until
he reached Fiftieth street, when, she
began to close upon him. A mounted
policeman just then came into view and
the thief dropped the watch, dodged
down Fifty-first street, up an alley and
lost himself. Miss Millard was badly
winded, but was so glad to get back
the watc . that she refused the offer of
the notice to care for her wheel and
procure a carriage for her to ride back
to town.

MARIN DAIRYMAN
REPORTED MISSING
Sheriff Taylor Asked to
Investigate.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOLINAS, April 29.â The residents
of this community are considerably
perturbed over the disappearance of
Frank Silva, v well-known dairyman.
The circumstances are such that to
day sheriff Taylor was communicated
With a 1 asked !<â  ma 1 an investiga
tion by ttv relatives of the missine
man. who fear Silva may have beea
the victim of foul play.
Silva lived on what is known as the
Lake ranch, a few miles from town,
and th>'i-i' conducted a dairy farm, with
three brothers as partners. -He was of
a sober ..nd Industrious disposition and
Haver drank to excess.
Shortly before hÂ»- vanished Silva
stood near the rear entrance of the
house engaged in conversation with one
of his brothers, named Manuel. After
a chat they i Lrted, Manuel fcoine to
the barn and Frank into the house.
When the time came to milk the cowb
Frank was nowhere to be found. At
first nothing was thought of this, de
spite the regularity of his habits, but
at the expiration of a half hour the
others repeatedly halloed for him to
make his appearance and assist in the
duties of the ranch. No response com
ing to these calls, one of the brothers
went t'> the house, but the man he
sought was not there. The next morn
ing the brothers grew alarmed and
came to town t<> -see if Frank had been
h( re, but nobody had seen him.
To-day Sheriff Taylor was notified of
the disappearance and will make a
prompt investigation. Searching par
ti, s here traversed the hills and the
beach, but no clew has been obtained.
Many believe the missing man may
have wandered away in a moment of
mental aberration, but at this theory
th<- brothers scoff. They say he was al
ways liehthearted. had no cares to
wmry him and must have been mur
dered and his body hidden.

stated the court takes the position that
the testimony is conclusive that bath
the refrigerated beef and the canned
beef were in good condition when de
livered to the Government and contin
ued so until issued to the troops, ex
cept in especial instances, when the
deterioration was due to accidental
c< ndltions in the transportation or to
the Influences of the tropical climate.
The report admits the liability of re
frigerated beef to taint quickly, after
removal from the ice chests. The court
finds the charges of "embalming" th<*
fresh beef to have been unsubstantiated
by testimony, and says no chemicals
were used to preserve it. It also says
that it would have been impracticable

ban campaign. The finding is also ad
verse to ih. 1 assertion on the part of
General Miles that the use of the beef
was an experiment.
PORT TOWNSEND
BOASTS A GHOST
POUT TOWNSEND, April 29.â The water front contingent is greatly
excited over the appearance of a ghost in the dark alleyway back <.f
the office of Rothschild & Co.. ship brokers. The alleyway leads to the
slips at the docks. Captain William Breeze, a pioneer shipmaster on
Puget Sound, claims to have encountered the ghost on several o<jeu.si> us
during the dark hours of ni trhi when passing through the alley.
A' â â â â  id'ng to Captain Breeze's statement, the ghost is that of a Ohi
nese with his head split in the center. It appears in the alleyway be
â n the hours of VI and 1 o'clock. The first appearance of the ghost
with its ghastly wound caused a thrill of terror to creep through the
nervous Byatem of the captain, and he lost no time in making a hasty
retreat. Bince th.n he has made several attempts to capture it and has
succeeded in getting within reaching distance. "When he would attempt
to lay his hands on the wraith, it would disappear.
[1 is claimed that on one or two occasions, when Night Inspector
phy of tlie customs service has 1 n making his nightly rounds in
search of opium smugglers, he has encountered the tomahawked Chi
jt Chinese never frequent this alley as a tradition exists
among thi-m that many years ago a Chinaman was murdered there by
a highbinder and his body was thrown into the hay.
Captain Breeze says that during his many years' experience at sea
in the various portions of the globe this his first encounter with a
ghost, and it is the first time that he ever realized a sensation of fear.
FLORAL FETE IN
CHARITY'S CAUSE
Close of the Redwood
City Carnival.
!i to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, April 29.â T0-night
witnessed the close of ony of the most
successful flower carnivals ever held at
this place, Jind by reason whereof the
kindergarten association treasury fund
ins been augmented by several hun
dred dollars. Great credit is due the
ladies of the association for the suc
cessful manner in which the carnival
was arranged and conducted. Interest
in the fete grew larger as the end drew
near, until to-night the capacity of the
hall Mas taxed to its utmost to ac
commodate the crowd.
The exhibitors have taken extra pains
to make their display complete and at
tractive, changing tho flowers every
day and rearranging their exhibits. M.
Lyncb's large display of sweet peas at
tracted much attention and was greatly
admired. From fifty to seventy-five
' varieties were always to be seen at his
booth, each bunched separately. The
carnations shown by the Krieg &
Goertzhaim nursery are one of the best
collections ever seen here, some of the
flowers measuring three inches in di
ameter, all perfect In development.
McClellan's display was probably the
moÃt artistically arranged of any and
contained the largest varieties of flow
ers, both growing and cut. Mrs. Glen
nan, a local amateur, had a display of
wild ferns that is rarely equaled. Mrs.
. C. Ross of Belmont, also an
amateur, deserves much praise for
her display, as well as for her gen
erosity in bringing flowers for decora
tive pur]" â 
This afternoon large wagon loads of
flowers were brought here to replace
those put up yesterday. After the com
pletion of the exercises this evening all
the exhibitors donated their cut flow
ers to the association, which auctioned
it., in off in bunches to the highest bid
der. Quite a sum was realized for the
kindergarten. An entertaining pro
gramme was rendered, being distinc
lvely a kindergarten affair, as follows:

LIBERAL CONTRIBUTIONS
FOR STORM SUFFERERS

KIRKBVILLE, Mo., April 28.âSubscrip

about half of the amount being contrib
Much attention is given to the charges
concerning the canned roast beef, and
it is stated that the testimony proves
it to have been wholesome and nutri
tious where used in moderation and
under favorable circumstances. The po
sition is taken that too much of this
ariicle of food was supplied to the men.
and that under the circumstances it
was unpalatable and found undesirable
as a continuous ration. The fact is set
forth that the canned roast beef had
not been used to any appreciable ex
tent before the beginning of this war,
and it is therefore regarded as a prac
tically untiled ration.
In view of this fact, the commissary
general of subsistence is roundly crit
icized for the purchase of the meat in
such extensive quantities. As to the
character of the meat for wholesome
cases and nutrition, the reports of Pro
fessors Atwater and Chittenden are
quoted at length, sustaining the claims
in this respect. The instructions of
the President are followed closely in
order and all the points indicated by
him as being those upon which he de
sired that inquiry should be made are
covered.
Accordingly, the court finds that the
meat was not "doctored" that it was
the beef of commerce; that there was
no more neglect than was incidental to
the hurried preparation for the war:
that the inspection, while generally ac
cording to regulations, was not always
up to the requirements; and that th"
sickness of the troops was not to any
great degree occasioned l>y the use of
either the canned or the refrigerated
beef.
On the other hand, it is explained
that General Miles himself did not re
port during the war that the l eef.
either refrigerated or canned, v n
fit as a ration, other officers wlv v'e
their testimony before the court i. T ere
found also to have neglected what the
court conceives to have been their duty
in this respect, and all are blamed for
this failure. But the court does not
think further proceedings necessary.

VAST IMPROVEMENTS
GOING ON IN LONDON
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, April 29.â While New. York
is just about to. begin the construction of
an underground road to relieve the. pres
sure of surface and elevated traffic, Lon
don has found the system so necessary
that a new line of tunnels extending un
der the city more than seven miles is
nearlng completion.
For some years past at various points
between the Bank of England and Shep
herd's Bush large boardings Inclosing
shafts have been eyesores to Londoners.
The work is now in its final stage, and
shortly -passengers will be shot through
tunnels at an average depth of eighty
feet below the surface from the heart of
the city to the suburbs.
Along the same Line of improvements is
a new tunnel under the Thames, near the
West India docks, and also a foot passen
ger tunnel under the river at Greenwich.
Then the London County Council is ac
tively engaged in preliminary work to
the construction of great thoroughfares
from Holborn to the Strand, an artery
between these two crowded centers, which
has been a vital necessity for many years.
Another project in connection with im
provements at Charing Cross station will
ajso make a great change in the existing
surroundings. The sum of money it is
estimated' that these municipal improve
ments will cost is about thirty millions
of dollars, while the underground railroad
: will cost at least as much more. The new
avenue sweeps away the Gaiety Theater,
but leaves the historic Lyceum to one
side. Toole's old theater is among tho
buildings to be removed, and this intended
improvement at the upper end of the
Strand will remove the Opera Comique
and Globe theaters, and the Charing
Cross changes include the demolition of
the Avenue Theater.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, April 29.â The Westliche
Post will to-morrow print an article in
the English language defining the pol
icy of all German-American papers in
this country regarding Americanism
against imperialism. Â» he article in
part follows:
' Mmc and again the attempt has been
made to supplant American republicanism
with imperialism. Time and again Ameri
can patriotism and that high and far
seeing love of mankind which unites men
of all countries in a common brotherhood
of humanity have rallied and won against
it. When, half a century ago, we had the
I same cries of "manifest destiny/ the
"'conquering Saxon." "expansion" and all
the rest we are hearing over again now,
Americans as radically opposed to each |
other in most tilings as were Calhoun and j
Corwin joined with Clay, Webster, Lowell,
Clayton and Clemens against it.
What American can read this without
an indignant refusal to consent that the
blood of tnose once our allies shall "sat
urate the soil" on which they were born
that we may be praised by the London
'i lines for our '"nook- work for progress"
in furthering Hritisli plans fur dismem
bering and robbing China?
What is there iii stalwart Americanism
(its native Americanism, if you will) ex
cept what Qerman-Americans are saying
it was in declaring that they gav< up
i home and friends and came thousands of
\ miles to an unknown country Tor the love
not of British colonialism hut of Armri- \
can republicanism. To iliat they are loyal j
; now and always. To Americanism, not to
thi British commercialism of the bayonet;
to Americanism, to liberty, to progress;
1 to freedom from militarism, to the expec
tation of a time to come when the world
will be no longer shackled by Imperial-
Ism with its bayonets and fetters; to that
German-Americans who renounced im
perialism in Europe are devoted now as
: they were lifty years ago, when they lis
! tened to Seward, as he said of these
same "expansionists": "Sir, they have
sent the American eagle abroad, bearing l
not the olive branch but a shackle in his
talons." The Hag of this great republic
stands now, not tor what the London
i Times approves but for what it meant
1 wlun Seward stood under it to utter this
; immortal sent< nee.
Such republicanism as that was not his,
: nor is it that of anj local German-Amer
â  lean, or of any other American who is
loyal to his hag and to his country. May
heaven forbid that it ever should be. May
the time never come when the American
l pie will applaud those who drabble a
< flag dedicated to freedom and human
progress in the blood of men who die on
their own soil resisting the same princi
ple of British lm< priailsm, against which
Ami r leans triumphed at forktown and
New Orleans,
Such ideas will never prevail In Amer
ica. Anj party which commits itself to
i them will btÂ» wiped out of existence. Any
: leader who attempts to check civilization
and progress and American institutions
and American principles will be repudiat
ed and disgraced; any foreign nation
which, for Its own selfish purposes, at
tempts to use the American people as a
catspaw in schemes of fraud and vio
lence will find Itself the victim of the re
: actions of its own violent scheming. Jus
â¢ tice., liberty, progress through justice and
liberty, until the whole world is elevated
by our national life as it lias been by the
Individual life of Washingtonâ that is the
I manifest destiny of Americaâ for that the

j cans are willing now, as they have always
been, to siake everything, knowing that
| when issues are made against liberty and

stake f,,r them, the American flag and for
all that is worthy of survival in the world.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant, Simple, Safe but Effectual Cure
for It.
Catarrh of the stomach has long been
considered the next thing to incurable.
The usual symptoms are a full or
bloated sensation after eating, accom-
panied sometimes with sour or watery
risings, a formation of gases, causing
pressure on the /jugs and heart and
difficult breathing; hea'ache, fickle ap-
petite, nervousness and a general
1 played out and languid feeling.
There is often a foul taste in the
: mouth, coated tongue, and if the inter-
ior of the stomach could be seen it
; would show a slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure for this common and ob-
stinate disease is found In a treatment
which causes the food to be readily and
thoroughly digested before it has time
to ferment and irritate the delicate
mucous surface of the stomach.
To secure a prompt and healthy di-
gestion is the one necessary thing to
do, and when normal digestion is se-
cured the catarrhal condition will have
disappeared.
According to Dr. Ilarlanson the safest
and best treatment is to use after each
meal a tablet, composed .of Diastase,
Aseptic Pepsin, a â¢ little Nux, Golden
Seal and fruit acids.
These tablets can now be found at all
1 drugstores under the name of Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets, and, not being a
patent medicine, can be used with
perfect safety and assurance that
healthy appetite and thorough, diges-
tion will follow their regular use after
meals.
Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn
street, Chicago, 111., writes: "Catarrh
is a local condition, resulting from a
neglected cold in the head, whereby the
lining membrane of the nose becomes
inflamed and the poisonous discharge
I therefrom, passing back into the throat,
reaches the stomach, thus producing
catarrh of the stomach. Medical au-
j thorities prescribed for me three years
for catarrh of the stomach without
cure, but to-day I am the happiest of
men after using only one box of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. I cannot
find appropriate words to express my
good feeling. 1 have found flesh, ap-
petite and sound rest from their use."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the
safest preparation as well as the sim-
plest and most convenient remedy for
any form of indigestion, catarrh of the
stomach, biliousness, sour stomach,
heartburn and bloating after meals.

CHAMBERLAIN TALKS
CONCERNING THE BOERS
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, April 29.â Referring to a
speech made by the Secretary of State
for the Colonies. Joseph Chamberlain,
early in the week, explaining that the
massing of a large British force in South
Africa waa due to the fact that the Boers j
had erected forts at Pretoria and Jo
hannesburg is legarded as a menace to j
Great Britain, the speaker declares that
the speech was quite as mischievous and
unjustifiable as Captain Coghlan's and
that it has given greater offense to the
Boers than captain Coghlan's gave to the i
Germans, and Mr. Chamberlain's Indiscre
tion wiis |ust as useless as Coghlan's.
In connection with the foregoing re
marks of Mr. Chamberlain another Indi
cation that the causes of friction between
Great Britain and the Transvaal con
tinue to Increase is given in the announce- I
incut by Mr. Chamberlain yesterday even-

STARR MAY HAVE
JOINED THE ARMY
One Theory Advanced
by Officers.
CLAIM TO HAVE EVIDENCE
RECRUITING STATIONS HAVE
BEEN NOTIFIED. *
Belief Gains Ground That the Miss
ing Pasadena Man Planned to
Envelop His Departure
in Mystery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 29.â Officers
and friends of the Starr family have
been diligently following to-day all
clews presented in an attempt to
fathom the mystery surrounding the
disappearance of Hillary S. Starr, the
superintendent of the Oak Knoll Ranch,
near Pasadena. This activity was stim
ulated by the rewards offered. The
ground was carefully gone over and the
search extended into li-nes that had not
heretofore been exploited.
The opinion has gained strength that
Starr left his home of his own volition,
with the avowed intention of enlisting 1
in the army. Officers who have made
a close study erf all attending circum
stances assert that a discovery made
to-day supports this theory. This is
embodied in the appearance of the
broken leather watchchain that wad
found where the mysterious struggle is
supposed to have taken place. The
remnant found bears evidence of hav
ing been prepared beforehand, as it ia
from the middle of the chain, leaving
I the buttonhole guard and the piece at
tached to the ring Intact.
Lieutenant Hunt, who is in charge of
the United States recruiting station
here, says that no one bearing Starr's
description has applied for enlistment
there, for if Starr desires to enter the
army he must do so in San Diego or
San Francisco. A black mole on Starr's
back will lead to his identification
should he have used an assumed name.
Sheriff Hammell will notify all recruit
ing stations and give descriptions.
While this theory is adhered to by
! many others assert that Starr was as
> sailed and that he has wandered oft
i and will die of starvation, and the flnd
: ing rrf his bleached bones will some day
unravel the mystery.

ENGLAND AND
RUSSIA AGREE
Sign Self-Denials as to
China.
Copyrighted. 0559, by the am **<J Pr*es.
LONDON. April 29.â The announce
ment that England and, Russia, have
s-lgned a pelf-denying" agreement re
garding China, which iE Intended to put
an end to the contention over railway
and other concessions in that country,
is the most important news of.tbe.day.
' It is officially confirmed here this after
noon, and the papers are running it
with big head llr^es.- The news comes
on top of George J. Goschen's
speech on "Wednesday last, in the
-course of which,. .aCter- taking, an-opti
mistic view ...f the political Future, and
"with reference .to agreements arrived
at with France and Germany, he said:
' **A friendly understanding with Rus
sia is also on t,he eve of conclusion."
The present agreement puts an end
to the Anglo-Russian struggle in China
and is tantamount to a settlement of
the questiun of the sphere of Influence
of the two count rier. Under the agree
ment Great Britain has undertaken not
to press railway or other concessions
in North China, while Russia agreta to
the Bntish d-mar.d that no part of the
ba<in of the Yang-Tsc-Klang shall be
allotted. Russiu also . recogniten ex
piiritly that British commercial inter
ests are supreme in the Yang-Tse-
Kiang basin, which is understood to
extend .-t considerable distance north
and scu;h of the rivf-r. though no at
tempt hÂ»9 beÂ°r. made to ... the re
gion. Ev.--:-thinsr recently has pointed
to Russia's desire for a settlement, in
order to allow the successful exploita
tion of the Siberian Railway, and also
with a view to raising money in Great
Britain for the development of the in
dustries of Russia. Tht activity of
Russian bankers and agents of the
Russian Ministry of Finance in Lon
don has borne testimony to the finan
cial end that Russia has in view.
Strong proof, of the anxiety of the
Russian Government to tap English
capita! appeared in the publication in
the London Times of a secret memo
randum recently submitted to a cora
mittee of Russian ministers by M. de
Wltte, the Minister of Finance, who
frankly states therein that Russia can
not dispense with foreign capital. Re
ferring to Russia's agricultural depres
sion. M. de Witt*:- pointed out tha free
trade England is the only mark iii
which Russia can rind relief. England,
he said, is the largest buyer of the ag
ricultural produce world. yet up
to the present tim* Russia has hardly
cny footing in the English market. M.
â¢ Wittc- adduced statistics of English
reports of cattle, sheep, wheat and
floyr, shov.-ir.fr that in each rase, ex
rept that of sheep. thÂ«^ United States
â¢â¢ \ â < rwheimingly headed the nations.
.vhile Russia was at the "bottom of the
'.:â¢:. H<- therefore urged the â¢â ring
.' Ruf-Hiaji ua'le with England and en-
upÂ«in .'"the importance of Eng
land for placing of Russian funds,"
and the "necessity of attracting British
capitalists by the stability of the agri
culture regulations of Russia," and
<jthirivisc- inspiring confidence.
To-day's announcement of the Chi
nes? Fettlfment is one of the first of
the fruits of M. de Witte's policy, and It
will undoubtedly have an Important
bearing upon the- future relations of the
two cou n tries. -

Insurgent Theosophists
Take Action.
EDecla! Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 23.â Independent I
theosophietE of this city met to-day in :
1 Lyric Hall to perfect an organization
opposed to Mrs. Katherine A. Tlnglev
and all her. works. The revolt against
the leader and official head, as Mrs.
Tingl^y terms herself, began last year \
when the successor to William fe- Judge 1
made the Theosophical Society in Am
erica a side issue of the Universal
i Brotherhood and summarily dismissed
; from the association several of the old
headquarters staff." They were. Elliott ,
'B. Page, James" M. Pryse.- John M.
Pryse. T. R. Prater and Mrs. Sarah ;
j Cape. ; ',â¢'â¢
Immediately there was an insurgent â 
camp of theosophists established, and
the gathering to-day, which was pre
liminary to a meeting to be held in the ;
same j place to-morrow, was the first
concerted charge on the works of the
enemy.
John M. Pryse issued the call for the
meeting. In his circular he paid con
siderable attention to Mrs. Tlnerlev. â¢
â¢ though he did not mention her name. !
In response to this call, a dozen in
surgent theosophists gathered in the ;
'hall this morning. Mr. Pryse said he ;
' regretted the small attendance, but
that he had received word from many
i prominent members that they could
! not attend until evening. So the or-
I ganization meeting was postponed un- I
j til 8 o'clock. ! There was an informal j
i talk, and Mr. Pry?? said: "It is time j
j for theosophists who cannot co-oper- '
j ate in the work of using the cause for j
i personal aggrandizement of an mdi- j
j vidual to form a real theosophical soci- j
j ety. The present methods in the Uni- j
! versal Brotherhood are clearly de- i
signed for the destruction of the to â
sophical cause, and it is necessary to
form another aeent to carry on the
work originally intended."
Mrs. Cape declared that of the the- â¢
osophists in this city not 5 per cent
gave allegiance- to Mrs. Tingley.
"Where she is known," said Mrs. Cape,
"there her influence dwindles.. It is in
j other sections of the country she main
tains her hold."
The attendance at the evening ses
sion was smaller than was expected. A
resolution was introduced, which, after
deploring dissension among the leaders i
in iheosophy, provided that Colonel i
! Olcott. president of the theosophical bo- i
ciety, whose headquarters are In In- '
dia; E. A. heirr.er. president of
the theosophical or literary branch of
the Universal Brotherhood, and Dr. J.
D. Buck, president of the theosophical i
society in America, be reaueste I to
come themselves or send representa- .
tives to a convention in October of this '
| ear.
This meeting is expected to make ar
! rangements for a general convention in
j December, at which all the troubles. of
1 the theosophists may be settled.
It was decided to hold the resolution
) over until those who met have effected
'permanent organization.
Mrs. Tingley is on her way from Call
j fornia. where she attended the Univer

HARVEST OF. DEATH
AT POWDER WORKS
Captain Stewart and
Four Others Killed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILMINGTON, Del., April 29.â Five
I men were killed and one fatally injured
! by the explosion of a powder press at
Dupont's- smokeless powder work to
; day at Carney's Point, N. J.. nearly op
i posite here. The dead are:
CAPTAIN STEWART. U. S. A dow
t der inspector.
HARVEY SMITH.
JOSEPH YEAGER.
ISAAC F. FRIENT.
AMOS MORRIS JR.
The latter four were workmen.
A workman named Russell was hor
! ribly mangled about the body and lost
; the sight of both eyes. He is not ex
pected to live.
The cause of the explosion is un
known.
It is believed that Captain Stewart
and one of the workmen were making
, a test of some powder in the Dress
â  mill when the explosion occurred. The
press mill was completely wrecked and
â¢ a number of valuable presses were de
stroyed. Yeager, Smith and Frient had [
j Just left the mill. They and Morris
were instantly killed.
Captain Stewart was badiy Injured
and died shortly after. The noise of
the explosion could be heard plainly in
this city, although the Delaware P.iver
separates the two places. In the vicin
ity of the. powder works the greatest
excitement prevailed. The families of
\ the workmen flocked to the entrance
I of the works and made efforts to learn
j who had been killed. The utmost dis
cipline was observed within the place.
Guards were stationed at intervals
j around the works and it was impossible
'to gain admittance. Rhysicians were
1 summoned from points near by and
I members of the firm assisted in the
: work of caring for the remains of the
dead and affording the injured men
what relief they could. At the same
time they did all in their power to ease
â  the minds of the families of the work-
I men importuning for news. The loss in
] money is not known.

COUNTRY ORDERS RECE
AMERICANS ARE
BLED IN HONDURAS
Outrages Perpetrated by
the Government.
Special Dispatch :
XEW Y< >RK. April 29.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: At the -
tary of State Hay, tho Navj
ment has referred to commanding
cers of American warships In southern
waters for their information the com
munication received from an Am
in Honduras. Bhowing the petty ;
cution to which he and hi^ country
men in that land are subjected by I
duran officials.
The letter has aroused great indigna- i
tion in official and naval circles and â 
officers of the navy acquainted with the j
facts say the Government should at j
once send a naval force to Honduras i
which would compel the Government j
to recognize and respect the rights of j
American citizens* The murder of j
Frank Pears in February is cited by j
officials with whom I talked as an in
stance of the outrageous conduct of the
Eionduran Government, one of whose j
soldiers committed the murder and was !
then permitted to flee into the interior j
to escape the demand it was expected j
this Government would make for his ;
punishment.
As the State Department's corre
spondent resides in Honduras the of- j
flcials decline to make public his name, i
but it is known that he is a highly re
spected citizen of this country engaged
in business in Honduras. He urges in
the interest of the safety of American
life and property that immediately a
warship be stationed in Honduran
waters at all times. He and his coun
trymen, he declares.' are subjected to
all manner of petty persecution. He
cites an instance where a nurse had
been taken from an American family
and compelled to serve a Honduran
official. During the recent revolution
all animals owned by the writer and
others were taken by the Government,
and at the risk of his life he was com
pelled to steal at night from the Gov
ernment corral the horses which be
longed to him. -
Americans are compelled to pay
blackmail or leave the country. Busi
ness men are required to make forced
loans to the Government, according to
! their means. Among those who refused
I to comply was one American, and In
! revenge for his refusal the officials
j turned loose In his pasture all the ani
j mals that could be collected, resulting
in the loss of his grass and tho destruc
tion of his crops. He adds that the
: only American who la respected is the
American with a revolver.
The cruiser Detroit Is now at IMue-
Reids, and before her departure from
the Central American coast she. may
be directed to proceed to Honduras to
Impress the Hondurans.
Officials q! the State Department say
that if Pears' claim is not paid within
a reasonable time a squadron will be
sent to Honduras to compel payment
and punishment of the murderer.
Naval officials say that this will be the
only way to obtain compliance with the
demand.' ';â  j '

CLASHES WITH A CONSUL
TROUBLE OVER THE CREW OF A
TRANSPORT.
The State Department Representative
Told to Get Off the Earth, but
He Triumphs Over the
General.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA. March 25.â United States
transport Grant, which leaves here this
afternoon, will have as passengers for San
I Francisco fifty-seven sailors, comprising
the former crew of the transport Indiana.
The Grant carries this letter.
The events in relation to this crew's
last days in Manila make an interesting
story. The Indiana's master is Captain
Morle. The fifty-seven men signed articles
in San Francisco on October 24 for a
cruise to terminate at San Francisco in
six months. This meant that they could
not be dismissed at Manila or any other
place than San Francisco when the six
, months had expired with less than enough
money to their credit to get back home
with, not to speak of the loss of time.
On March 21 the Indiana arrived in Ma
nila from Hollo, and the captain ordered
the men to American Consul Williams'
! office to be paid off, as he had employed
i a Filipino crew to take their places. The
: next morning the men appeared at the
consulate, followed by the Indiana's
I purser; with $7000 to pay them with. Arti
cles were drawn releasing the Govern
ment ship from the contract, but the men
refused to accept their pay under such
conditions, with no transportation pro
vided for their return home and be turned
adrift in a city so far away.
After several hours of parleying night
was near, and as General Otis had issued
strict orders for every one to be off the
streets by 7 o'clock under penalty of be
-1 ing shot by the military police a grave
problem confronted United States Consul
Williams, with fifty-seven mad sailors on
his hands, and without money. The Con
sul had less than one hour in which to
hire a steam launch and get the men on
some ship in the harbor for the night. He
took them to the Indiana, but the captain
'. bluntly refused to take them on board.
Then the Consul ordered the launch con
taining the fifty-seven moneyless sailors
to proceed to the transport Grant, where
Captain Jesse A. Baker, the quartermas
ter in charge, promptly refused to have
| anything to do with them without orders
. from Colonel Pope or General Otis.
Now it was 7 o'clock and Consul Wil
liams headed the launch with fifty-seven
hungry men for the mouth of the river
Pasig to land in front of the office of the
captain of the port Near there is the
i military police station, and he secured a
'â¢ guard of soldiers to accompany the men
through the streets to the English' Hotel,
where he arranged with the landlord to
allow the men to sleep on the ground in
the inclosure back of the hotel and give
! them what he could in the way of food
at the expense of the consulate!
The next morning Captain Mori- went
to General Otis and gave his side of the
story. Any one who has had any experi
ence in handling seamen knows that the
differences between captain and crew
when formulated into separate stories are
the exact antithesis of each other. Gen
: era! Otis had no sooner heard Captain
Morle's story than he sent an orderly for .
Consul 'Williams. The Consul told the or- !
.1. rly to tell the general he would be up
in a few minutes.
"No, the general wains you immediate
ly." said the obedient orderly.
"All right," said Mr. Williams, and put
ting on his hat he started for the Gov
ernor's palace within the willed city.
He faced General Otis to find him In a
rage. Otis did not even greet him civ
illy. He demanded that Consul Williams
explain what right he had to meddle in
affairs here.
"Why," said Mr. Williams. "I am the
United States Consul and always treat
with such matters where American sailors
are involved."
"But you are in America now; Manila
I â â¢â  American, and you have no business
here," shouted Otis. "I am Consul here:
I am Governor; I am everything, and I
want you to leave i.l of these matters
alone in the future."
Consul Williams Intimated quietly that
thÂ« State Department at Washington was
responsible for his presence in Manila
whereupon Otis roared something to the
effect that that department had nothing
to say, anyway, when Ihe military came
in."
"Do you take the responsibility for the
; disposition of these men?" asked Wil-
I Hams. : ; '. ';'.'
"Yes; you drop everything in regard to
it. I will handle them."
Then Williams' withdrew, feeling like
the small boy who .iad been spanked
Going to his office he found the fifty-seven
sailors waiting for him.
"Well, boys," said the Consul, "1 can
| do nothing In regard to your case any
I more. General Otis .las taken it out of
my hands. You must see him."
It was now the past the noon hour and
the boys were getting very hungry, so
they started at once to see General "Otis.
Four of the" leaders went up to the gen
eral's office, the remainder waiting out
side. The four were escorted before the
commander of all things in the Philip
pines.
"Well." roarer! the general, "what right
have you men got around the streets here
at all hours of the day or night? You
are simply loafers, and 1 am going to send
you to jail."
The men tried to explain their position
and the circumstances. The general sent
for Colonel Pope, the chief Quartermaster,
to consult with him. They talked it over
and the general with nearly 30,000 men un
der him was puzzled, Night was ap
proaching and the fifty-seven sailors were
standing outside, dinnerless and supper
; less, it is not on record that Major Gen
â  eral Otis ever retreated before, but he did
! this time from the position he had taken.
He sent to Consul Williams as urgent a
summons as he had sent in the morning
to come at once.
mrse Mr. Williams coifld do nothing
but obey. The genera] humbly told the
< onsul he could find no way to handle the
nun and he requested Mr. Williams to
take them In charge and keep them at the
expense of the Government until the
â¢ sailed, when they would be sent
home and paid off in San Francisco
Consul Williams told The Call repre
sentative he hoped the Government wculd
close his office and let him go home but
he was very guarded about referring to
General Otia In regard to the trouble with
the Indiana s sailors.
The Indiana's men arrived in San Fran
clsco "ii the Grant yesterday. Their con
tract expired on April 24 while at sea, and
th<y will now be paid here according to
its terms.

VICIOUS TRAIT IN
REDLANDS' YOUNG
TRAIN WRECKER
Cunning of the Criminal Dis
played by Little Harry
Gregg.
REDLANDS, April 28.â Harry Gregg
of this city, the youngest train
wrecker, or would-be train
wrecker, in the world, has not the
j appearance of a vicious child; indeed,
his countenance is open and frank and
his animated conversation gives one the
I impression that he is a vivacious,
straightforward, but very precocious
youth, except for an occasional sly
I glance of the eye, revealing the under
current of cunning in his nature. Al
though nine years old, he is rather
I small, appearing to be a year younger
as barefooted he scurries about, clad
; in a waist and knee trousers, with a
I cycling cap jauntily placed upon the
back of his head and leaving protrud
ing from it a bountiful supply of hair
of the "tow-head" type. He has a round
face, with a '"pug" nose, rather small
mouth, the corners somewhat de
i pressed, and eyes always i in motion,
; partly as though from bash'fulness and
; partly as though seeking some object.
His eyebrows and lashes are light and
indistinct and his face is covered with
large freckles, though not of a dark
| shade.
As he talked to-day he was constant
ly in motion, yet showed no disposition
to run away or to avoid an interview.
: As he talked he drew rapidly, with his
toes, in the dust by the roadside circles,
rosettes, scrolls and conventional de
signs of good proportion and well bal
anced; yet doing it while talking and
apparently without giving the matter
a thought.
"Are you fond of drawing and do you
do much of it?" he was asked.
"Yes, indeed," he said; "we draw
. some every afternoon 'most. We study
colors, too. To-day we had yellow and
blue papers. Teacher gives us a piece
â if paper like this (holding his hands
about eight inches apart) and we cut
them up into strips and show all the
colors from normal yellow to normal
blue."
"What do you mean by normal blue?"
"Normal yellow is jest yellow, with
out any other color in it; then you keep
adding a little blue until it is jest blue
and no other colors in it, and it's normal
blue. We have different colors some
times and make pretty things. I'm in
the third grade now. and Miss Trip
pett's my teacher. I'll be in the fourth
grade next year, same's that great big
girl there. She's nut been to school for
some time, so she don't get promoted."
So on he rattled away from one thing
to another, telling about different peo
; pie and their family relations, as his
eyes would fall upon the school children
passing.
"How did you come to wire the piece
of rail to the railroad track?" was
asked.
"I didn't know that it'd wreck the
train," he said, quickly.
In the trial before the Justice of the
Peace two witnesses had told how he
did it. and he heard their testimony:
but when he was examined he denied
positively having had anything to do
with it, and said he knew nothing
about it.
"I didn't want to wreck the train, as
mamma and papa were on it and I'd be
awful sorry."
His parents were not on the train and
;he knew it perfectly well. Rut it is a
remarkable thing that he never lacks
for a plausible explanation or excuse
for any act.
"I jest tied it up close to the track
sos the thing on tho side of th>- wheel
couldn't go between and would split
the piece of iron (a section of steel rail
three and a half feet long), 'cause I
wanted it in two to make a thing to
put beside the wheels of a handcar I
was goin" to make to keep the wheels
from goin' off the track, this way. you
see."
Taking several pieces of straw from
, the ground, he explained that the bai>

However, Score What They
Term the Government's
Blundering Policy.'
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, April 29.â The Coghlan in
cident at New York has been very gen
erally discussed by the German papers
this week, although it is evident, as
stated to the Associated^ Press corre
spondent here by a responsible member
ber of the Government, that the jour
nalist mouthpieces of the Government
did not desire to construe the objec
tionable utterar es as anything more
than the remarks of a man who had
not been accustomed to measuring his
words.
For a day or two a number of the
leading newspapers published severe
strictures on the case. With a view to
obtaining a declaration from govern
mental headquarters, the correspondent
sought an interview with Privy Coun
cilor Hamman, as high official of the
Foreign Office. Having been instructed
by the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
Baron yon Bulow, Councilor Hamman
said:
"So far as the Foregn Office knows,
there never was a serious misunder
standing between Admiral yon Died
â  richs and Admiral Dewey, not even
during the early part of last summer.
We ill not deny that there may have
been slight hitches at first, for the situ
ation was a difficult one for both Ger
mans and Americans. Admiral Dewey
may possibly have suspected for a time
that Admiral yon Diedrichs was in
triguing with th- Spaniards at Manila,
or that Germany may have meant to
take a hostile stand. This may have
been due to certain evolutions of our
ships which Admiral Dewey miscon.
strut'd. On the other hand, Admiral
Diedrichs probably keenly felt the re
strictions of a stringent blockade,
which greatly hampered the move
ments of his ships. This irksome posi
tion may have tried the patience of Ad
miral vcm Diedrichs at times. This, we
believe, was the case both at Manila
and at Iloilo, but whatever the little
unpleasantness grew out of, this condi
tion never, if we have been correctly in
formed, took a serious complexion, and
it never was so understood by either
party. All of this was over long ago
iind the gn^s has overgrown it. Ever
since the end of last summer the rela
tions of Yon Diedrichs and Dewey have
! been of the most pleasant character,
and according to the latest advices are
now. to the extent of rendering mutual
services and fraternizing on more than
one occasion. The same conditions ex
ist at Samoa, where, all reports to the
contrary notwithstanding, our advices
show that never since the trouble be
'â  pan have the crew and the commander
of the German cruiser Falke and those
of the English and American vessels
ceaspd to be cordial and pleasant. This
has been the case especially with theÂ»
Americans. Among the crew of the
United States cruiser Philadelphia are
a number of German-Americans, and
through them friendly intercourse came
quite naturally. All our reports agree
<m this point.
"German residents of Apia," Coun
cilor Hamman continues, "especially
mention that they had not had to suf
fer nearly as much from the Ameri
cans on account of passport regulations
and other warlike measures as from
the British, thanks to the more urbane
methods of the former.
"Regarding the utterances of Captain
Coghlan, the Government," Councilor
Humman concluded, "has attached no
importance to the incident. The as
surances received from "Washington on
that subject have been entirely satis
factory."
Some of the newspaper comments
elicited by Captain (Vishlan's utter
ances are very significant. For exam
ple, the Frankfuerter Zeitunp admits
that it saw no necessity for the dis
patch of a large German squadron to
Manila, and asserts that the squadron
interfered injudiciously with the Amer
ican blockade. The Frankfuerter Zei
tunia: alleges that this interference was
due to direct instructions from Empe
ror William.
Even more significant is the fact that
the Cologne Yolks Zeitung, the main
organ of the Center, the dominant
party in the Reichstag, has an article
agreeing with the foregoing statement

and containing the mysterious passage:
"Perhaps it was due to negotiations
on the part of Germany in order to ob
tain, if possible, a coaling station in
the Philippines, that a number of our
vessels were sent to Manila. If this
presumption is correct, those who sent
instructions to Admiral yon Dledrlchs
without the knowledge of the Foreign
Office received a bitter lesson. The
Foreign Office has since been engaged
in repairing the blunder and has suc
ceeded with the American Government,
but not yet with the people of the
I'nited States, as the Coghlan incident
again demonstrates."
The force (if this editorial article is
heightened by the fact that the paper
in which it was published was, in the
outbreak of the war with Spain, one
of the most virulent enemies of the
I'nited States. The Yolks Zeitung and
other newspapers advise Germans not
to undervalue the importance of hos
tile demonstrations accompanying the
Coghlan incident, putting them on par
allel lines with similar incidents on
both sides in the period preceding the
Franco-German war.
The jingo Agrarian press seizes the
opportunity to attack the Cabinet and
particularly the Foreign Minister,
Baron yon Bulow, and to reiterate the
charge that he is pursuing a vacillating
policy.
The North German Gagette, for ex
ample, says: "Advancing at. the wrong
time and then retreating at the wrong
time â that has been our foreign policy
for a decade past."
Other newspapers continue the cam
paign for a larger navy, insisting that
if Germany wishes to remain a world
power she must have many more ships.
so as to be able, to interfere at any
time and anywhere. The great ma
jority of the newspapers, however, pre
serve a calm and reasonable tone over
the Coghlan incident.
The correspondent of the Associated
Press learns that Emperor William has
taken a deep interest in the Coghlan
incident and in affairs that have been
developing in Samoa. While visiting at
Wartburg the Emperor had full reports
sent to him in regard to both matters,
including a copy of the satirical ditty
which Captain Coghlan recited at the
conclusion of his speech at the Union
League Club in New York and which
his Majesty read with great amuse
ment.
ENGLISH LENIENT AS TO
COGHLAN'S INDISCRETION
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, April 29.â The Coghlan in
cident has caused a great deal of stir
on this side of the Atlantic and has
furnished the press of England and the
Continent with a fruitful topic of dis
cussion throughout the week. The
English papers have taken a lenient
view of Captain Coghlan's indiscretion,
and except in the case of one or two
notoriously anti-American journals,
have been disposed to find excuses for
him.
The Spectator, in an article which is
typical of English comment, says*
"Though we must join in the censure of
Captain Coghlan fur his indiscretion,
we must not forget that what he said
was substantially in accordance with
the facts. The Germans behaved at
Manila in a most irritating and un
friendly way to the United States. It
was absurd for them to expect to play
the part they played without raising a
feeling of the most intense bitterness
in such a high spirited body of men as
the officers and sailors of the American
navy. An explosition of this feeling
was bound to come sooner or later."
The Saturday Review, in an article
characteristic of its treatment of any
thing concerning Americans, said:
"Had an English captain made Cap
tain Coghlan's speech, if such a thing
is conceivable, or had a German officer
made it about England, there would
have been war; but the Americans are
treated by the world like spoiled chil
dren. We, however, do not envy the
position, of Captain Coghlan, from
which he can only escape by accepting
an imputation upon his sobriety."
The Speaker takes a more common
sense view of the matter and rejects
the "brutal and insulting suggestion
of the German papers that Captain
Coghlan was intoxicated."
The Speaker assumes that Captain
Coghlan thought he was talking in con
fidence to personal friends and mem
bers of the Union League Club ami "let
himself go." "His heaviest punish
ment." the Speaker adds, "will not be
any that the Secretary of the Navy can
inflict, but the consciousness that he
has unwittingly done an injury to his
own country."
FINE STREET RAILWAY
SYSTEM FOR SAN JOSE
SAN JOSE. April 20. â The sale of the
First-street electric railway .system on
May 19 to satisfy a mortgage indebted
ness of $200,000 to the German Savings
and Loan Society of San Francisco prom
ises to bring out some spirited bidding.
There are two parties already in the
field who want to acquire the franchises
and equipment of the line and it is ru
mored that San Francisco capitalists also
have an eye on it. The system is about
fifteen miles in length and fully equipped.
It runs the entire length of First street
to the cemetery, with feeders leading into
each of the four quarters of the city.
Messrs. Henry and Burke, owners of
the San Jose and Santa Clara Electric
Railway, have been conducting negotia
tions with the German Savings and Loan
Society looking to its purchase. Now an
other buyer has appeared in the person
of A. Greeninger. who is at the head of
a company of local capitalists. <;reenin
ger has an application before the Board
of Supervisors for a franchise for an elec
tric road out First street from the north
erly city limits to Alvlso. These men pro.
pose to bid on the First-street road In
the combine is Hugh , enter of the Alum
Rock motor road. If they are successful
they propose to make the Alviso road a
part of the First-street system. The Alum
Rock road will then be changed to an
electric road and the branch running out
Delmas avenue will ne extended to Camp
bell and perhaps to Los Gatos.
The purchase of th" First-street road
by either of these two parties of capital
ists will give San Jose one of the finest
street car systems in the West.
Transferred to Yolo County.
WOODLAND. April 29. -The cam of
Mrs. Carfleld against I. M. Bedell et al.
will be transferred from the Superior
Court of San Francisco to Yolo County.

catiDn of Arthur ('. Huston, attorney for
defendant The action is to recover a lot
of diamond Jewelry which is now in the
possession of the defendant, J. B. Wright.
Nealy Found Not Guilty.
WOODLAND. April 29.â The jury in the
I rase of Thomas Nealy, which has been
lon trial in the Superior Court for two
days, has rendered a verdict finding the
defendant not guilty. Nealy was charged

LABOR IN HAWfUI.
READERS of The Call have not forgotten our
ample notice of what would follow annexa
tion of Hawaii in regard to the labor situation.
I The country proved passive in the master arid an
nexation was accomplished, with the assurance that
the â  â  i the joint resolution which effected it
amply covered the coolie contract labor issue' with a
complete prohibition.
Since annexation there is no change in the govern
ment of the islands. The Dole constitution is in force
there as the fundamental law. and it is administered
by the Dole government precisely as before. The last
Congn ected to pass any law fixing a form of
government, and there is no civil relation between
Hawaii and this Government except through the
executive, and he is free to a.ct independently of any
constitutional restriction.
Ever since annexation a stream of Asiatic cnolie
l,:bi- louring into the islands, under con
tract and penal restriction, just as they were before
the countrj 'â¢â¢ part of our domain.
The latest news is that President Dole has been
â  â  ton that the annexation reso
lution does not affect the Hawaiian labor system,
which remains in force and effect until Congress
Â» to change it. This is just what The Call said
nation, and justifies to the letter
our analysis of the annexation resolution. Those who
â  d our conclusion are invited to study the out
c< ime and be wise.
We are not just now discussing the effect upon white
labor and ; home of penal contract coolie la
bor and wages in the islands, with the most of its
product admitted free of duty to our domestic markets
in competition with the same product raised lure by
white labor. The future must develop the i ffect upon
r and its emploj r ers here. Thousands of a
have entered Hawaii under contract since annexa
tion, and thousands more will follow before Congress
â¢ 3 any restrictive measure, if. indeed, it will con
â  such action necessary at all. What is of espe
cial :i"ii just now is the renewal
of the same "Id ambush behind which the designs of
Dole were hidden before annexation. This now takes
tiie form of a declaration that the proprietors on the
islands have a policy for the future, which means "a
gradual reduction of contract Asiatic labor and a cor
responding introduction of free American labor into
cane fields. The delay in the application of
American laws will enable the planters to
American labor rules by degrees. Col mcl Wl
c in American labor will receive
earh ti I i. There probably will be a company
â¢ .n a- the American labor supply company,
backed by the I gencies."

THE SPEAKERSMIP.
\A OST of the influential newspapers .of the Pa
/ - -1 cil stn mgh urg :d the election
â of a Western Congressman as Speaker of the
Representatives. -Merc opinions,
however, will not accomplish that result. There i
be preliminary organization and selection of a candi
tern States will probably Win
the prize.
In a contest for tin Speakership it would be neither
â¢ â  .ht to draw sectional lines. The first
â  to b< considered is qualification. There is no
more exacting position in any branch of the Federal
â¢ rnment. An unusual combination of general
krowledge of public affairs, familiarity with parlia
mentary law and with the specific rules of th< I 1
coo! judgment and executive force, is essential to
the â â  ' of men and to the
prompt and successful management of the public
busim - .
â  lly tin right man can be found among
the Western R tives, and every consideration
icpediencj' and of justice demands that he should
be selected. Since the foundation of the Government
four - have upplied the entire list of Speak
er- and in the following proportions: Pennsyl
vania 4. < ticut 1. New Jersey 2. Massachusetts
4, North Carolina 1. Kentucky 6 (Henry Clay hav
been thrice elected), South Carolina -\ New
York 2, Virginia 4. Tennessee 2, Indiana .3, Georgia
I and < Hiio 1.
It thus appears that of the whole number of pre
in tUc lov if Congress sixteen
â  from tKe Easl en from the South
ern States and ten Middle State?. The
Wesl has never had a representative in that exalted
station.
According to the existing geography of the Union
there are nine Eastern States, with <ij representatives;
eight Middle States, with 115: fourteen Southern
Stales, with m:. and fourteen Western States, with
4; Thomas R. Kcr<], twice eleel - eaker, who has
displayed great ability in the discharge of his duties,
canu from Maine, which also furnished James G.
Blame, boi which has only four Congressmen, while
California has --even. Upon this array of facts and
res, into which much of our history is sugges
tively compressed, it i^ certainly .not sectional to
claim that the successor of Mr. Reed should be some
gentleman of unexceptionable character and qualifi
es from the West The States lying to the west
of the Missouri River have been greatly neglected by
the Federal Government. Tins State, which lias
poured untold wealth into the Union, and, in propor
tion to its population, has contributed enormously to
the ordinary and to the extraordinary expenses of the
Government, has waited nearly half a century for just
recognition at Washington. It is time that the in
fluence of the Western Stmes should be effectively
exerted to secure their share of legislative and admin
istrative power and honor.

so many quarters N by organization and by concen
tration. The Republican Representatives of the
Western States must unite upon a candidate of their I
cwn and repress competition among themselves.
Inere is ample time before the next Congress meets
for them to agree upon a selection. With a single
name to present, unanimously supported, indorsed by
the pre-s, and with all the collateral influences that
can be employed, there would be a fair prospect of
success. The effort itself would be a manifestation of
po,vei and would command attention. The trend cA
commerce, trade and population toward the Pacific
is too palpable and too rapid to be disregarded.
IS THERE (\ NEW COMBINE ?
IT is to be regretted that the appeal, from Judge
Seawell's decision in the gas contract case has
been dismissed. Of course there was no necessity
of prosecuting the litigation further, since the Mutual
Electric Light Company has accomplished its pur
pose in annulling the gas contract and in securing
permission to erect poles outside the fire limits, but
; the principle involved in that decision was one which
; should have been passed upon by the Supreme Court
in order that competition in furnishing light to the
people of San Francisco might have been firmly es
tablished and guaranteed for the future.
Judge Seawell, in his ruling, laid down the broad
proposition that the constitution guarantees every
individual, company or corporation the privilege of
competing in the business of supplying the inhabi
ts o! cities with water and light. Indeed, he went
a little further, and declared that under the constitu
tion the Board of Supervisors cannot prevent this
competition by refusing to grant competing compa
or individuals pole privileges and other rights
to which they are entitled by implication of law. This
was an exceedingly broad and comprehensive view
tc take of the ivater and light question, yet it is one
that is undoubtedly correct.
The dismissal of the appeal, however, will prevent
rhe incorporation of the principle into the law of the
Mac. Judge Seawell's decision may be ever so sound,
' it is not authority which other courts are bound
to respect. Until the Supreme (.'our; passes upon a
proposition and enacts it into law no respect is paid
. bj the lawyers to it in their contentions with each
other.
\\ c do not complain because the Mutual Electric
ght Company has dismissed this appeal, for even
had v prosecuted the decision to a final determination
the Supreme Court, it would probably not have
I in establishing anything. The latter
â  ijial will not decide cases, which do not involve
tine controversies, ranting of a pole
privilege by i â  of Supervisors and the annull-
I of the gas contract practically destroyed the con
troversial Features of the case.
There is a suspicion in some quarters that the compe
â i introduced by the Mutual Company has brought
old monopolj com-,-:; to terms, and that the ter
mination of this litigation in this way is part of a
scheme of amalgamation and main 1
prices. We hope this rumor is untrue, since its reali
ion means aim] ly a repetition of ancient history.
COMMERCIAL EXPANSION.
*C^ ENAT< >R FRYE is not always a safe guide to
>^ follow, but hÂ«' understands thoroughly the in
dustrial am! commercial interests of the coun
' try. and when he speaks <>:i such subjects his words
are well worth the attention of all. His addre -
the banquet given in Mew York in his honor last
â¢i illustration of both th<
â¢ and the excellence- of his statecraft. Marred
here anil there by unfriendly reference to Germany,
I by a tone of jingo imperialism with respect to
Philippines, it was, nevertheless, a notably strong
ument for governmental aid toward that cothmer
expansion which 1- .Â»o necessary to our welfare.
After pointing out the wonderful development of
: c United State-, and the increasing
c commercial war among civilized na
tions, he directed attention to the fact that Germany
is likely to In- our keenest rival for trade, that her
less thrm half of our^. and that to
compete with her we must devise some means
â 'ing our commerce to meet that competition
We cannot reduce wage-, nor would
it be desirable to do so if we could, hut we can mi
pro â  nsportation system so as to enabl<
merchants to deliver goods in foreign markets as
j cheaply as any other p<
Senator's argument on that point i- interest
ing. As freight ships increase in carrying capacity
the ci -t of transportation decreases. When the
larKc^; freighter icross the Atlantic was 3000 tons the
freight rate was $8 50 a ton: when (Soon ton-. $6 a ton:
when 8000 tons. $3 50 a ton, and when 10.000 tons
50 a ton. So thai to lover freight rates we have
only to provide for the upbuilding of a large mer
chant marine, composed of ships of the first class.
Continuing that line of argument, the Senator went
on to say: "We should carry in our own ships and
â  I r our own flag all of our import- and export-.
We should pay to our people the $100,000 a day we
. pay to foreigners. We should make of the offi
cers of those ships active, intelligent and interested
agents for the discovery of new markets and the pro
motion of our trade. Suppose to accomplish it should
cost us 5t0.000.000 annually, would there lot he ample
compensation? Great Britain, Germany and France
will not surrender their carrying trade without a de
l rtnined conflict, which alone will reduce freight
, rates 25 per cent."
After an able exposition of the advantages sure to
result from the opening of the Nicaragua canal and
of the growing importance of the trade of the Orient,
the Senator went on to point out that in the strug
for that trade we ghould have an advantage over
â¢ill European competitors by reason of the fact that
those markets are nearer to our Pacific Coast than
to any European country. We have, therefore, only
to ptavide an adequate merchant marine to assure a
rich commercial development Such being the case,
the people may well ask the Senator why waste
money, energy and blood in a foolish adventure of
imperial expansion when so much more of profit and
honor can lie coined by the peaceful ways of indus
try and 1;

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNflUGriT.
Boljne casual consideration is due to
the circumstance that the recent police
raids upon the gambling; dens of the
city were made a few days after Po
lice Commissioner Gunsi li n town, and
not' a few days before, Whether due
to the chance that governs coincidences
or to sagacity on the part of the police
officers matters little; the i hief thing to
note is the advantage we derive from
i it. At present we have the satisfao
-1 tion of knowing that Mose "has went."
while an earlier raid on gambling
rooms might have resulted in hi? de
tention.
* * *
The difference between the degrees of
activity of the police before and
after the departure of the Gunst
Commissioner is so marked it
may possibly be significant of
something. The absence of a Com.
I mlssioner may have as much effect
' im a torpid police force as the pres
â  ence of a pill on a torpid liver. It would
be worth while to make a further ex
periment in the matter. Perhaps if
Commissioner Tobin were t;iven a leave
of absence beyond the limits of th"
State there might be raids on some
other things as well as on gambling
rooms. At any rate, no harm would
be done were the Supervisors to recom
mend the Commissioner as a proper
person to succeed General Smith as
superintendent of police in the Ladros
Islands.

By this time it is probable the legis
lators of the recent session have re
covered sufficiently from the surprise
caused by the suddenness with which
the signature law dropped Into innocu
ous desuetude to be in fit condition
to receive suggestions. It is timely
therefore to direct their attention to
[ the well-known fact that the hope of
reward is a much more potent Incen
tive to action than the fear of punish
ment. If they wish to obtain the sig
natory scalps of newspaper men they
should offer a bounty for signatures
equal at least to That offered at one
time for coyote scalps. There can be
little doubt erf the success of such a
law. Under Its operation everything
; would be signed. Journalists would
come in from Arizona and Nevada to
Sim*. "Taxpayer," "Citizen," "Veri
tas," "Vox Populi," "Old Subscriber,"
"Alas. Pooi forick" and all the anony
-1 munculi would sicrn. Even Gage, were
the bounty mad.- equivalent to the
' value of a sheep, would eh <> rfully sign
I good bills, as well as bad on ts, and thus

<Â»ur learned friends, the Egyptolo
s, have "got 'em again." Some
time ago. in exploring an ancient tomb
of the time of the Thothmes dynasty,
they discovered certain hieroglyphics
which, all the expert's agree, represent
tli- war cry of the Egyptian armies of
that period. The intoxication of joy
over the discovery soon turned, how
ever, Into til*- delirium tremens of rage
by reason of differences of opinion as
to the meaning of the cry. Some au
thorities assert the inscription is "Hi 'â >-
Ra" and as "Hoo" is an exclamation ol
devotion, while "Ra" is a word used
impartially for God. King or country.
they Insist the old Egyptian battle cry
was a loyal, patriotic and religious
shout, "For God, King and Native
land." Other authorities say the hier
oglyphics ni"an "Hu-Roo," which
would make a very different kind of
battle cry, for those words signify
nothing of patriotism or religion; their
equivalent in our language being "On
to plunder."

While Egyptologists, intoxicated with
the spirit of their own learning and
made delirious by disputation among
themselves, so that they now see snakes
in one another's boots, may regard the
difference between their translation as
! a matter of vital importance to the
1 welfare of the world, those of xis who
are more sedate and never have intoxi
cations of any kind can see in the issue
nothing whatever to fight about. It is
rather interesting to learn that the
"hurrah" cry was used in Egypt be*
fore the days of Joseph, and therefore
is not. as we supposed, an American-
Ism bursting forth spontaneously on
the Fourth of July, 1776: but there will
be little attention given to the dispute
as to its meaning. It is probable both
translations are right. There have been
very few armies of invasion since thf;
world began th.it did not shout with
an equal fervor â  Hoo-Raâ For God ana
Country," and "Hu-Rooâ On to Plun
der." It's a way they have in the army.
If. however, there be a distinction be
tween !>><â  two, further research will
probably disclose that the ancient
Egyptians shouted "Hoo-Ra" in mili
tary campaigns when they went forth
to die. and "Hu-Roo" in their political
campaigns, when they were out for th^
oflices.

mainly to German ignorance of naval
etiquette. The German navy is but a
parvenu institution of mushroom
growth, and its officers have not yet
ned the rules. Such at any rate ia
th.' judgment of the British officers who
were in the port during the time of
the controver&y. n Is stated thai when
a (".â¢â ;inaii cruiser entered Manila
and without paying any attention, to
Dewey'W blockading fleet, proceeded'ta
plcfc out an anchorage to suit herself,
she was brought to a sense of the situ
ation by a shot from the Olympia.
Captain Chichester of the British navy,
observing that things were going
wron.g, went aboard the Olympia to â  x
plain, and in doing so he is reported to
have said to Dewey "You see, sir, the
Germans have no sea manners." That
is probably a correct explanation of the
seemingly intentional offense. All the
same, it is natural th^ Americans were
offended. There is nothing more irri
tating to a polite naval officer than a
breach of naval etiquette.
Â» * *
At the preat feast which the
lords of the Southern Pacific spread in
honor of him who incarnates their mo
nopoly and provides them with salar
ies; the feast at which the chicken con
somme was served a la Lucullus in the
dish, and in thive languages on the
menu; and at which three preachers of
three different faiths were set up like
bouquets, to Rive grace to the revelry*
Mr. Eiuntington made a speech. Served
with wine and oil arid other palatable
things at the banquet, the speech was
no doubt easily digestible by those who
heard it: but to the outer world, served
cold next morning without any of the
;k cessories, it was not altogether pleas
ing.
(if course it was a great speech. The
South- in Pacific Company does nol do
little things, nor indulge in minor ora
tory. Its course through th*- records of
tho State cannot be traced by frag
ments of 25-cent rhetoric. The only
really little thing it ever did was to
perpetrate a Gage on the common
wealth, but that is so diminutive it
doesn't count, and will soon be forgot
ten. The speech was of the kind that
carries with it the conviction that while
tho railroad man of our time may be a
development by natural evolution from
tin- highwayman of the days when
there were no railroads, yet he has a
philanthropic heart and yearns to
grasp all humanity to his breast and
take the whole world in.
Tin- dominant sentiment, that which
gave the toif of the whole in one clear
sound, is to be found in this sentence:
"In our treatment of others, if we have
fortunately reached the higher plane
ourselves, let us not fail to recollect
that we owe a duty to those toiling
ones, who are mounting as painfully
and slowly as we did the steps that we
have trod."
The higher plane! The plane on
which was spread that feast at which
American chicken was served under a
French form in the nano- of a Roman
Consulâ the plane of accumulated
wealth ami dinners at abo"~ J ?_o a ;
1- it any wonder that Rev. Horatio
Stebbins, looking into the higher plane
fan's, should nave said: "When I look
uri and down this board 1 notice th.'
differeni vocations represented here
and 1 feel a little conceit of personal
advantage as I think how you would
feel if you hail to write a sermon."
Now that the reverberations of the
"Man With the Hoe" have about died
away, it will be well for Mr. Markham
to consider whether he might not writ*
a companion piece to show the other
side of the human animal the other
: form of degradation wrought by en
vironment. A picture to serve him as
a theme is ready at his hand. Not long
ago there was exhibited in England a
painting that became the sensation of I
the year. It was called "She Man With
: the Muck Rake," and the idea was
taken from the description of the per
sonage bearing that title in "Pilgrim's
Progress." It was a picture of the
moral ruin wrought in an essentially
noble nature, not by the burden of
labor and poverty, but by devotion to
wealth. To produce a poem on such a
theme Mr. Markham need alter but lit
â¢ tle what he has written of the "Man
With the Hoe." Something like this
would serve:
THE MAN WITH THE MUCK RAKE.
Bent with the eagerness of greed, he leans
Upon his rake, and gazing at the muck
i Where lie the riches and the refuse of the
earth,
He deems that mass of rottenness to be
The highest plane of all felicity.
Who made him dead to rapture and de
spair,
A thing that grieves not and that never
hopes: *â  W ;
Glutted yet greedy, a brother to the hog?
Who loosened and let down this brutal
jaw?
Who starved this soul, while fattening
this paunch?
Whose breath blew out the light within
this brain?
What gulfs between him and the Ser
aphim! /'â¢ : '
Slave of the wheel of Mammon, what to
him *
Are Plato and the swing of Pleiades?
O workers, lords of ballot and of pen,
The makers and the masters of the world.
Custodians of the gospel and the law:
Is this the handiwork you give to God,
This monstrous thing, distorted and soul
quenched?
How will you ever straighten up this
shape,
Give back the upward looking and the
light?
How will it be on that not distant day
â¢When he hath raked the whole globe bare
And finds no more to feed his maw withal?
The ease with which Mr. Markham'9
'â .Man With the Hoe" can be made to
Berve as "The Man With the Muck
Rake," by simply changing the title
and one or two lines, is a proof that
1 from a poetical standpoint there is but
iittlc difference between humanity <>n
the highest material plane and that on
ih-> lowest material plane. 'Time's
tragedy" is about as apparent in the
B 'Mli'l thought of the plutocrat as in
the "aching stoop" of the ditch cHk
gef. To tin' one no more than to the
other is there anything in "the long
I reaches of the peaks of Bong, the rift
'of .lawn, the reddening of the rose/
It. Siebbins is Aghi the only people
who have a ri.yht to be conceited are
those who can preach sermonsâ and
, Mr. Huntington can do that.

Conway Resisted Arrest.
Thomas Conway, a teamster, attempt
ed to drive hurriedly over the crossing
at Fourth and Market streets last evening,
when he was arrested by Officers Farley
and Ross for fast driving. Conway vig- j
orously resisted the efforts of the officers
to arrest him, and it was found necessary
to choke him Into submission. A large
crowd gathered and hooted the officers.
Cries of "Shame." "Give the man a
chance" and ~ other similar expressions
were uttered by the crowd. At the City
Prison Conway was charged with being
drunk and fast driving.

Knocked Down by a Car.
An elderly woman named Margaret
Smith, while crossing Ninth Btreet, near
Mission, last evening, was struck by
car 11 of the Sutter street line. Fortu
nately she was not seriously Injured. She
was carried into a house at 113 Ninth
Btreet and Dr. Do re sent for by Captain
Spillane, who had been notified of the
accident. He found that beyond a few
Blight bruises she had escaped unin

Chinese Union Trouble.
Tolice Sergeant Donovan yesterday
morning ordered torn down a notice
which had been posted by the Chinese
Tailors' Union, warning all non-union
tailors to join. "When he first noticed the
placard there was an excited crowd
around it, and he feared that if it was
allowed to remain the old trouble which
i aused the shooting of Ho Yu would
break out afresh. That the Chinese are
ir"ttlnK ready to do more shooting is
shown by trie fact that two were caught
with pistols in their possession last night.
They were arrested and hooked on a
cfiarge of carrying concealed weapons.

The Convention Adjourns.
The convention of the Debating League
of Northern California ended yesterday
with the election of ollicers, which took
place in the morning. A. Miller was
chosen president to succeed W. N. Frick
atad. San Rafael was selected as the
place of the next convention and a resolu

CROWDS ATTEND
THE CATHOLIC
LADIES' BAZAAR
Contribute to Cause of
Charity.
CELTS ARE OUT IN FORGE
BOOTHS PRESIDED OVER BY
PRETTY WOMEN.
Bright and Attractive Girls Draw the
Nimble Dimes From the
Pockets of Generous
Visitors.
The Catholic Ladies' Aid Bazaar con
tinues to draw good-sized crowds at Na
tive Sons' Hall, and the prospects are
exceedingly good for a generous sum to
be added to the fund being raised for
"sweet charity's sake," notwithstanding
the fact that contrary to precedent up
admission fee is charged. Last night was
Celtic night, and the Celts were there in
goodly numbers prepared to enjoy them
selves and at the same time to contrib
ute to a worthy cause. If any there were
who entertained the idea that because
they were allowed to walk In without be
ing held up at the door they could at leasl
Ugure on having saved the usual price of
admission, they reckoned without their
host.
No one, man, woman or child, was per
mitted to leave the hall until he or she
could furnish satisfactory proof that it
would be profitless to detain them longer.
The many tastefully and beautifully dec
orated booths were well worth paying a
good price to see, and of course it was
simply impossible to look upon the many
pretty and useful articles displayed for
sale without making a purchase. And
then there were the auctioneers, men
with abnormally developed voices, -who
discoursed on the wonderful qualities of
their wares until hypnotized spectators
parted with their cash almost uncon
sciously but none the less irrevocably.
Then there were the hordes of pretty
girls, who besieged each newcomer with
petitions to purchase a chance for some
thingâanythingâfor 10 cents or maybe
25 cents. Tin re was no denying the "ap
peals of these youthful hlghwaywomen,
for even if the object of the attack was
proof against the captivating eloquence
of bright eyes and smiling lips it availed
him naught, for he was surrounded and
importuned until he was compelled in
sheer desperation to "produce." But the
stand-and-deliver methods of the girl
bandits left no feeling of resentment In
the breasts of their victims. The latter
invariably parted with the coveted dimes
in the best of humor, and the results of
the lawless methods employed is seen in
the stream of small change flowing into
the coffers of the bazaar.
The auctioneers sold anything and
everything for what they could get, and
they usually managed to get very fair
prices, although bargains were not infre
quent. The voting contests are progress
ing at a lively rate, but as is always the
case the friends of the various candidates
are holding back the bulk of their votes
until the closing days of the fair.
The management of the fair is preparing
an entertaining programme for Dewey
day, and a big crowd is expected on Mon
day night. The lunchrooms, which are
open evenings and from 11 a. m. to 2 p. m..
are well patronized, and an appetizing
lunch is served. The fair will close next
Saturday night. \t â¢
At Glen Park.
The San Mateo electric line is con
structing a spur track from the Che
nery street bridge into Glen Park. To
day's programme at the popular resort
will consist of the following numbers:
The five St. Leons in acrobatic perform
ance; Jack Symonds, the celebrated
conversationalist; Dumas and Dumont
in black-faced comedy; Johnson and
Durant, the musical wonders; Elsie St.
Leon on the flying trapeze; Cramen^
the terpsichorean premier, and ia'eko'
the gymnastic ape. During the after
noon there will be a carrier pigeon
race, the birds being liberated about 3
o'clock.
Monday, Dewey day. there will be a
grand patriotic celebration by the chil
dren of the public schools. The enter
tainment will commence at 10 a m
with a drill of 5000 public school chil
dren under the leadership of Professor
George Miehling, physical instructor in
the public school.
Must Serve His Sentence.
Frank Tyrrell, a deputy pniindkeeper,
who was sentenced to pay a fine of $200,
with the alternative of serving ninety
days In the County Jail by Judge Mogan
some months ago and appealed against
the judgment, was recommitted to Che
jail yesterday, as the Superior Court had
affirmed the judgment of Judge Mogan
Tyrrell was charged with using abusive
and filthy language in the butcher shop
of G. Tassi, in the presence of several
ladies while attempting to capture a dog
belonging to Tassi.

FREEHOLDERS
HOODWINKED BY
THE MONOPOLY
Telephone Bug in the
New Charter.
CITY FATHERS' HANDS TIED
GIVEN NO AUTHOBITY TO REGU
LATE TOLLS.
The Corporation's Agents Tricked the
People's Representatives by
Cleverly Worded Pleas of
Injustice.
The immunity from municipal control or
Interference which the Pacific Telephone
and Telegraph Company will enjoy under
the new charter, at least as far as con
cerns the regulation of it 3 charges to the
taxpayer of this community, is the result
of carefully laid plans, backed by per
suasive arguments of representatives of
the monopoly who appeared before the
Freeholders and pleaded earnestly, almost
tearfully, that its business would be se
riously impaired and the dear public
greatly inconvenienced should the city au-'
thorities be clothed with authority to fix
the tolls it could charge its patrons with
in the corporate limits. The telephone
company's agents did not fail to suggest
Unit the city fathers could not under the
constitution of the State legally exercise
such power, even if an attempt were made
to confer it upon them in the charter.
The bug in the charter, the existence of
which was pointed out by The Call, yes
terday, consists as stated of omission
rather than commission on the part of the
freeholders, chosen by the people to frame
a Bet of laws for the future government
of the city. They ignored telephone tolls
in framing that valuable document, but
they did so with their eyes open and at
the urgent solicitation of the monopoly.
This is freely and frankly admitted by
the members of the judiciary committee
of the Freeholders, which consisted of
Henry N. Clement, chairman, Dr. E. R.
Taylor and A. Comte Jr., to whom the
whole matter was referred and on whose
recommendation final action was taken.
Mr. Clement said last night that his
recollection was that the subject had
been lefcrreM by the Freeholders to the
legislative committee of which Mr. El
lert \v;:s chairman, which committee re
ported against inserting any paragraph
in the charter giving the city authorities
power to fix telephone rates because of
doubt as to its constitutionality and be
cauÃe of the fact that the telephone com
pany's business was not confined to Sail
Francisco solely, the same reasons prac
tically as elucidated by Dr. Taylor.
"It is possible," said Mr. Clement, "that
the m-itter was referred to my commit
tee, but 1 do not recollect that it was.
The control of telephone rates by munici
pal authorities Is a new thing, and for
the reasons stated it was thought best to
leave it out of the charter. I was -uid am
now In favor of the fixing or control of
telephone rates by the city, and if the
business of the corporation within the
limits of the municipality can be segre
gated from its outside business the char
ter ran very likely be amended to meet
the requirement."
Dr. Taylor says the question was thor
oughly discussed and considered and the
members of the committee took the action
which they deemed for the best interests
of the community.
â¢â <>f course ] cannot recall offhand all
that was said on the subject at the time,"
said Dr. Taylor last evening, "but I know
there were several reasons for our decid
ing not to make the fixing and regulation
of telephone rates a part of the charter.
In the first place we doubted our consti
tutional right to do 80, and in the second
place we decided that even if the rates
could be legally fixed or controlled by rep
resentatives of the people, the power'could !
not be delegated to the city authorities
for the reason that the telephone com
pany's business is not confined to the city,
but its lines extend into the adjoining
counties, and in fact all over the State.
You must remember the telephone com
pany is not lik? a gas company or the
water company, whose rates are regulated
by the city. In the case of the latter their
business Is strictly and solely with the in
habitants of the city, and they arc purely
local concerns. In the case of the tele
phone company its business is not local
and tiie same rule will not apply. There
Is scarcely a person in San Francisco,
who uses a telephone, who does not at
Wast once a week call up some one out of
the city. The local and outside business
of the telephone company is so interwoven
that it would be extremely difficult, if
not impossible, for the municipal authori
ties to properly and satisfactorily adjust
the tolls to be charged for city business,
even if they could be legally empowered I
to do so. Any such attempt would be cer
tain to result in endless confusion and
wrangling.
"These matters were all presented to us
by the telephone people and taken in con
junction with the doubt that existed con
cerning the constitutionality of any mu
nicipal law to regulate telephone "rates,
we decided to leave it out. Of course the
new charter is by no means perfect, but
if flaws are found in it. the remedy is
very simple and easily applied. W>
have managed to get along for a good
'â . many years without municipal control of
i telephone companies in the fixing of rates,
and I don't think it will be any great .
hardship for us to go a year or two longer
if it is desired to amend the charter so as
1 to have the fixing of telephone rates taken
from the hands of the telephone pe-ople."
Mr. Comte. wbilo a member of the
1 Freeholders' judiciary congmlttee, was not
! present at the meetings when the tele
i phone matter was up for discussion, a.nd
! although he said there were reasons why
i the charter ignored the rate question he
was not prepared to say what those rea
sons were. "Dr. Taylor can tell you all
about the matter." he said.

While this touching Incident was un
folding Itself the young men from across
the bay and those from the halls of the
State Capitol were doing nil Hurts of fancy
baseball steps on the diamond. The Ben
ators, reinforced by Hon. Truck Kgan,
late of San Jose, came down with a blood
curdling resolution to put ' '.'.'. Ewlrig and ]
hi? cripples so deep In the hole that they
would not be able, to crawl out again this â¢
year. Rut somehow their resolution did i
not fill, and unless they capture both of j
to-day' giimÂ«Â»s they will return to their |
constituents with i ho target.
It was Russell's day. ami to him is duo
the responsibility for Sacramento's down
fall. He was simply invincible, and to
that fact the Senators owe their present
position of tallenders. Two hits, one
in the third and a double. in j
the ninth, wore all they could score off
Russell's delivery. The last hit. Bh< â  I
ban's double; ought to have been pulled
down by Hardie. but Clam Juice Lou mis-
Judged it. and though he made a wild
dash into the heavens for it he could not
connect. Had he annexed It Sacramento
TTOUId have been shut out. .Kussoll did
rmt pi) in .â â¢â¢:â¢ record. He was
content to send up a variety of ball that
the opposing batsmen could do nothing |
more with than to roll along to an In- i
fielder, with an occasional fly to the out- '
field. Dunleavy was back in the game,
being the last of the Oakland crippios to
round into shape. A couple of ''â¢'â â¢ â  neat
ly trapped was the extent of his labors.
Bclimecr played the etar fielding game for |
Oakland, and ran bnses like a chamois
bounding over the Alpine crag?.
Doyle was In the box for the Senators
nnd was fairly effective, though at times
Inclined to be a trifle erratic. Stanley
kept him well In hand, however, and
pulled him out of several precarious situ
ations. In the eighth the first three Oak
landera nil plunked out singles, and it was
only by the sharpest kind of fielding that
they wore prevented from scoring in that
inning. Had such fielding prevailed
throughout the game there is no telling
when either side would have scored, but
it did not, and. Oakland won, mainly
through Shanahan's misplays.
It was this way. Up to the sixth inning
not a run had been made and only one
hit was credited to each side. It was ,i
remarkably fast and pretty contest. Then
with one man out Sehmeer tore off a sin
gle and stole secon/i. Lange sent a
smoker down to Egan, who assisted him
out at first; Schmeer going to third. When
Shanahan got the ball he went Into a
trance and Sehmeer stole home, with the
big rst baseman staring at him, but
making no effort to cut him off.
In the seventh Dunleavy was sal on
Shanahan's muff. Moskiman hit to Egan,
forcing Dunleavy at second. Had Shan
ahan held Dunleavy's fly Moskiman would
have been retired at first. As it was he
was safe and scored on Hardies long
double to right. Hardle went to third on
Lee Hammond's out and tallied on Rus
sell's single two runs, when clean fielding
would have shin off any.
Pacramento scored on a fluke in the
ninth, when most of the spectators were
going home under the Impression thai it
would be a whitewash. With one out
Doyle was given his base on balls, stole
second and after Egan had struck out
completed the circuit on Sheehan's scratch
double. Tho score:

this afternoon, In the presence of a large
crowd, by a score of 11 to 3. Up to the
seventh Inning the score was 2 to 1 In

brought in two Beachcombers. In the
eighth inning Burge's wicked ball to right
let tv more men reach home. In the
ninth Santa Cruz made six runs. Watson
vllle's poor field work was partially re
sponsible for the defeat. The Beachcomb
ers' heavy batting did the rest. When
they landed on Harper they effectually
demolished his curves. Balst pitched a
masterly game. In the seventh, with two
men on bases, be struck out three Wat
sonvillians. The star play was strelb's
catch of a difficult fly and Donlin'a catch
of a hot ball sent to center by Belna. The

<â¢->. can't tell the difference between a magnate and a politician, anywayâ '
V Millsey and Herrin look alike to him. It was not such a reception as either ,

THE CITY'S GAS BILLS
ARE STILL UNPAID
PERRAULT SAYS CHARGES ARE
EXORBITANT.
An Effort Being Made to Put a Stop
to the Purchase of Supplies
by Means of Requisi
tion.
The question of the payment of the
city.- gas bills foi December and January
is still undetermined. Festi rday when
the Finance Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met it was found that two
lof the members of the committee â At
tridpe and Collinsâ had signed the bills,
but Chairman Perraull refuse.] to do so.
He s ild the attempt recently made bj
the board to authorize the payment ol
the bills without the Mayor's signature
was clearly Illegal, and he would not be
come a party to any effort I â¢ do so. He
also declared that the Gas Inspector had
â¢â proved the bills, it being und< i -
: hat he made the claim that th< r<
was. more gas charged for than had i>e* n
imed. After some discussion th>- '
bills . red to the < las inspector,
and no final action will be taken until he
has made a n port on tin m.
Irman Perrault said thai the bill '
for furnishing gas to the Broadway Jail
for one month was $333 10. Or this amount
-â  - . onsumed in the
range In use there, and the balance for
thirty-two lights. This he considered ex
orbitant, and should \io made the sub
ject â¢â : a thorough investigation. Mr.
Perraull also brought up the matter of
the purchase of supplies for the police
patrol and lire alarm telegraph. He point
ed oui that during the month of April
| more than $6000 was expended in this de
partment, the g is being purchased on f
itions made out by Superintendent
Hewitt, in many instances the bills had
been split up so th.it the total of
would fall Just below the $300 mark In or
der to avoid advertising for competitive
lilds. Perrault said he Dei!eved the goods
used by this and all othi r d< partments of
the city government should be purchased
by ci ts to be b
the lowest bidder. At his suggestion v
resolution was adopted requiring the Su
perintendent of the Police Patrol ai d Fir
Alarm Telegraph to advertise for i>ids for
supplies needed by Ins department.
Perrault suggested that a similar res
olution lÂ» passed which would be com
nslve enough to cover all of the sup
plies used by every department ..:' â ,>..
nment. This, he said, would d"
away with the requisition system now In
vogue, and would effeel a saving of thou
of dollars annually. The signing of
these requisitions Is now In the hands of
the chairmen of the various committei
and In the past has been a fruitful Bource
of illicit rev i nue.
Supervisors Collins and Attridge would
not agree to Biis, and the matter was

REFUSED TO BE
THE VICTIMS
OF SWINDLERS
Clever Ruse of Confi
dence Operators.
FAILED TO BAG THEIR GAME
TRIED TO IMPOSE ON A HOTEL
CLERK.
They Also Attempted to Rob a
Stranger, but Were Frustrated
at the Point of a
Revolver.
The polico are searching for a well
dressed man who attempted to swindle
the clerk of the LicK House out of $25.
Friday afternoon the scb< mer, who rep
resented that he waa G. K. Stickle of An
gela Camp, and who is temporarily stop
ping at the Lick, telephoned to the clerk.
Informing him that he had purchased a
suit of clothes from the Hub Clothing
Company and Instructing him to pay the
hill and charge the same to him immedi
atelj on the arrival of the clothes. He
also announced that he would send the
clothes to thÂ« hotel by a messenger-boy,
A short time afterward a messenger-boy
visited the hotel and handed the clerk
a package bearing the stamp of the Hub
claiming that be had been instructed to
collect that amount before he parted
with the packagi , Suspecting something
wrong the clerk opened the package and
found that it contained an old quilt. The I
boy, when questioned, said that he had j
been given the package to deliver by a
man who lived in a lodging-house at U
Third str< t.
Realizing that the boy was innocent of
any connection with the attempted swin
dle, the clerk summoned Policeman Ross,
who accompanied the messenger to the
room occupied by the stranger. Evidently
aware of the approach of the officer, the
would-be swindler packed his grip and
made hia escape. Hi is described by the
messenger-boy as being about 35 years of
age, 5 reel 6 inches In height, and had a
small blonde mustache. He wore a
gray overcoat and a dark derby hat.
The police think he is the same man
who some time ajin victimized several
south-of-Market-streel business men in a
similar manner.
James W'ilkins. a recent arrival from
n, Ariz., yesterday visited police
headquarters and Informed Captain Bohen !
of how three bunko men had attempted
to rob him In a rooming-house on Post
street, between Grant avenue and Stock
ton street.
"They <iid not gel me this time," he
laughingly remarked. "1 was onto their
game and came out $"''i winner."
Wilkins' story was that lie was walking
along Grani avenue, when he was accost
ed by a well-dressed young man. who en
gaged him in conversation. The stranger
asked him to accompany him to the house
on Post street, where he claimed several <
friends wire uniting for him.
â¢'After reaching the house," remarked
Wilkins. "I wa.s taken to a room where
men were engaged in playing three
card moote. At their earnest solicitation
1 took a hand in the game, and In a short
time had won $60. Knowing that they had
allowed me to \^i" that amount so as to
encourage me; l jumped tb< game and
,i to leave the room. â¢ Â»ne of the
gang attempted to stop me, and as I 1
â  red ' hat they would not hesitai
knock me down and rob me I drew my
revolver and threatened to shoot the first
man who attempted to stop me. They
made no further resistant- ami I quickly
left the house."
Wilkina gave- a good description of the
men to the police, and every effort is
being made to apprehend them.

The coursing yesterday was delightful
to the talent, as Jhe long shots, witl
exceptions, carried the day. The reason
assigned for the success achieved by the
talent, or in other words "those who keep

that the good dogs wer< drawn against
inferior performers. To make connec
tions in the betting the wise men had to
lay $4 and $6 to bag $1. The exceptions
were the Pear Not and Belle Seward

The United States transports Grant and |

well-known New York families on board
in the persons of sons of Senator Hale,
Secretary of State Hay and Congressman
Dalsell. '
The steamers lay off Powell-street wharf
during the afternoon. Just before dusk
they were ordered into quarantine by Dr.
Brook the Federal Health Officer. They
were taken at once to the station off An
gel Island, where they will remain until
all danger of Infection is past. The trans- â 
ports were quarantined because of small
pox developing during the voyage. John
Kay a fireman on the Grant, died on the
23d ins tJ and was buried at sea. The body
was thrown without ceremony through
the ash chute of the steamer while she
was going at full speed. This action was
taken, it is affirmed; by Second Lieuten
ant Conger, V. S. A., without the knowl
edge of the ship's officers, who were pre
paring to give the body decent sepulture.

sea Second Lieutenant Conger, V. S. A..
announced himself commanding officer of
the ship. He sent orders in writing to
Captain Arey. On the 3d hist, the lieuten
ant called a meeting of the" men and noti
fied them that he assumed command and
was the superior officer of the ship. He
ordered the men to do guard^duty and
then placed those on board under military
rule.
It is claimed the stripling lieutenant was
ordered to report for instructions in this
city. This means he will be allowed full
pay during the voyage and mileage at
the rate of 4 cents each for 8000 milts.
When the Grant stopped at Nagasaki
for coal Lieutenant Conger said every one
on board must procure a pass signed by
him before he could leave the ship. The
order was not obeyed, although some
passes were issued signed by Conger's
name, made by a red rubber stamp. The
next step was to arrange the seats in the
dining saloon, each officer according to his
rank. All civilians were excluded from
the officers' table.
He blew hot and cold regarding the
men of the Indiana's crew, first Baying
he feared an outbreak from them and
later saying if anything happened In the
Ehip he would, call upon them for assist
ance. He issued an order that the en
listed men who had paid for first class
passage could not use the baths or other
accommodations. This order was later
rescinded when the men made a stand
against it.
There were twelve monkeys and a fight-
Ing cock on board. He ordered the sen
tries to capture them and throw them
overboard. This was done, after loud
protestation from the officers' wives on
board. The strongest monkey of the lot
caught the log line and drew himself
aboard again. When near the rail he was
again thrown overboard and was drowned
with his companions. The fighting cock
belonged to one of the men, who tried to
gave him. but could not do so.
The Grant is the largest vessel that
ever entered the Golden Gate, and Is the
' finest transport afloat. She was originally
â  the steamer Mohawk of the Atlantic
Transport Line, and was used far carry-
Ing cattle. She was purchased, with six
sister ships of which the Sherman is one,
and was fitted up at an expense of over
1150.000. She is 'built of steel, with double
steel bottom; four continuous decks, one
smokestack and four masts, and cost
originally $1,250,000. She is provided with
twin screws, three double-ended Scotch
boilers and triple- expansion engines of
48-1 nch stroke, capable of driving her at
14 knots an hour. She is 455 feet long, 40
feet beam, 40 feet depth from upper deck,
with a gross tonnage of 5750 and a load
displacement of 12,000 tons. She weighs
about 50,000 tons.
Kindergarten Entertainment.
A pleasant afternoon was pjK-nt by forty
mothers and some little onea at the
mothers' meeting: held at the kindergarten
on the corne-r of Polk and Paciii<- streets
on Friday, afternoon. This free kindergar
ten haÃ only been recently opened and has
fifty children attending. Both principal
Maude Lee Abbott and Assistant Sophy
Raymond Are enthusiastic over kinder
garten work and have spared no timt or
labor in th<- cause. Mrs. Abbott's idea in
holding mothers' meetings is to bring the
parents to the kindergarten that they
may learn more of child lift.

SLAVE TRADERS

LABOR REJOICES
Sensation Caused by
The Call Expose.
CHINESE LAWYERS ARE IDLE
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
IS DULY PRAISED.
The Reform Inaugurated Shows That
the Government Is in Real
Earnest in Enforcing
the Law.
The anii X- published exclusively In The
Call yesterday concerning the failure of
oi the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company to secure the reinstatement of
Ben. E. Meredttn as head of the Chinese
IU was the talk of the town. It had
always been suspected and even telt that
there had been a strong Influence con
. with the turning loos,- of Fong
Suey Wen, and it had been pretty well
understood that Meredith had been ap
pointed chief of the bureau and had l n
retained as such by the political Influence
of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
and of thf Southern Pacific Company. On
no other hypothesis c< ild be explained
the tacit approval of the peculiar manner
in which the bureau had been condu
and the energy with which Its deposed
chief had !>â¢ â  n -
But the public did not expect that the
piracy un the part of the steamship
company to flood this country with cheap
coolie labor would be bo completely
proved a.Â« It was by the admission of the
chief lobbyist of the Southern Pacific
Company to The Call correspondent at
Washington; when he J said that his peo
pie had instructed him to secure the reln
statement of Meredith and that lie had
reported to thejn that the task was lm
possibre because the .Secretary of the
Treasury had informed him that Meredith
had i â -â¢.n proved to be to blame for the
t ape of the procuress.
The statement made to O. P. Huntington
by K. }'. Schwerin that the dismissal of
Meredith had been "a body blow" to the
coolie transportation business of the
steamship company let the political cat
out of the. bag and threw a Hood of light
upon many things that had happened In
the -bureau and that had been thought to
be merely mysterious. It explained as
plainly as a picture without words why
7""" Chinese immigrants had been admit
ted during the past two years, as against
only 34<X> during tin last two years of Col
lector Wise's administration, It explained
also why the flood since the Ist of last
January has dribbled Into an almost in
significant stream, and why attorneys
who bad all the business they could do in
the way of getting Chinese immigrants
Into the country had deserted the Ap
praise) building since the confidential
friend of the Scnwerin-Huntlngton com
bine transferred his activity to some other
sphere of usefulness.
It proved that The Call was right when
it contended that the coolie importers
were allowed too many opportunities by
the loose methods prevailing in the man
agement of the bureau, and It placed upon
the shoulders of the apologists of the bu
reau the onus of explaining that their
advocacy of that system had been
prompted by a desire to see *che exclu
sion law carried into effect." Men who
were suspected of crooked work- and who
kept the carpet warm with the frequency
of their comings and goings to and from
the sanctum of the bureau chief fled the
place and vanished from the gaze of the
public and the press like rats scampering
from a sinking ship. It was a silent but
no less eloquent admission that when the
appointee of the Bcbwerin-Huntlngton
â importing tong was not there to
see that everything went on well It was
useless for the coolie brokers to attempt
to continue business at the old stand.
y arnontf labor circles v\.is The
Call's i xpose hailed with delight, for most

of California wan th< new- thai a check

The system of vesting the appoint

a fair trial for many years, and nothing

THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 30, 1899.
DRANK, SMOKED AND
DIED AFTER APOLOGY
MRS. L, AIKENS of Sacramento had the misfortune yesterday to be
mixed up in a tragedy. She herself was not present, but her name
was a link In the career of young William T. Muhlenfels.
M ihlenfels was discovered yesterday morning In his room in the
Ruse House dead, lying on a lounge, with a bullet wound In his left
breast, a pistol by his s'id>-. an empty champagne bottle and a glass on a
small table at the head of the lounge, and a half-smoked cigar held be
tween his ringer.-. The dead man was clean shaved, ixatly dressi-d and
won a deep red rose in his coat lapel.
cm Friday morning the clerk uf the Kuss House received a telegram
from Sacramento addressed to Mrs. !.. Alkens, to be called for. An hour or
two later a dispatch signed "Will" was received from the same city, ad
dressed to the clerk, Inquiring whether Mrs. Alkens had received the tele
gram which had been sem previously. The clerk replied (the answer having
prepaid) thai she had noi called, and that the telegram was still there.
In the afternoon the deceased appeared at the hotel and asked whether
Mrs. Alkens had registered, and he was Informed by the clerk that Bhe had
not. He wenl awaj without making any comment and returned at about half
past 8 o'clock in t>ie evening. The clerk noticed th.at he had been drinking.
but he was not drunk. He registered himself as 'W. T. Mubi-nt.ls. X. V..'^_
arid waa assigned to room 57, Before going to tin- room lit asked tjhe clerk
whether hi would be allowed to have liquor brought to tmj room, and the
c!Â»-rk answered that there was no objection. After Muhlenfels had retired,
was about 9 o'clock, he rang for the bellboy and ordered a pint bottle of
champagne, He paid for the wine with the change which the clerk had given
him "ut of b ten-dollar piece tendered for thf use of the room.
That was the last seen of him until a quarter to 8 o'clock yesterday morn
inc. when a chambermaid, making the rounds of bedmaking, came to the
room and found the door unlock. -d. She looked Into the room and saw the
d.,id body of Muhlenfels lying on the lounge with a partly BmoKed cigar
between Ule first and second fingers of his right, hand. The ewjty Cham
boftle and glass Were on a table at the head of the lounge. When
Toner's deputies arrived they saw that the deceased had moved aside
his coal, had placed the revolver with the muzzle against his left breast
and had s.-nt a bullet juÂ»l under the region of the In-art. The cigar still re
mained between his fingers, but the pistil had dropped from hi.s hand to the
lioor.
On a sheet of note paper obtained from the eb-rk was written the following
â¢with a blue pencil. H was the. apology of an unselfish suicide who, not
withstanding the solemnity of the act he* was contemplating, seemed to re
gret the annoyance he might cause the hotel people:
"Gentlemen: I am sorry to do this in your bouse, but it is unavoidable.
Homei Dickey, it WS23 Eighth street, Sacramento, <"al.. may think enough of
me n , -Â, thai i un properly buried. Have me cremated and scatter my
ashes My folks at 610 West Une Hundred and Forty-seventh street. New
York, will see to it. WM. T. MUHLENFELS. 1 ;
A dispatch from Sacramento gays: "Mrs. Leslie Aikens, who was men
tioned by William T. Muhlenfels, who killed himself in the Rusa House to
day, has been keeping a lodging-house at 725^i J street in ibis city. Muhlen
fels lived with her and up to a short time ago the two were great friends.
rdlng to a recent complaint lodged with the police It is learned that the
luarreled not long ago and that Mrs. Aikens drowned her sorrow by
drinking more than she ought. Shortly after this they became reconciled
and Muhlenfels prevailed upon Mrs. Aikens to sell him the furniture in the
lodging-house. The next day he borrowed the money he .iad paid her, and
the day after Mrs. Aikens reported to a police officer that Muhlenfels had
kicked her out of die house. The officer, chancing to meet Muhlenfels, asked
him What the mattet was and why he had treated Mrs. Aikens so. Muhlen
fels denied the story and declared that he was very muc-h in love with the
grass widow and :bat she could live with him as long as she "wanted to.
There was another row between the two a few days ago. Mrs. Aikens on
Chursdaj told her policeman friend about It and said that she would
Bee that it came out al! right. She was then on her way to San Francisco.
â¢â¢Yesterday Muhlenfels poM the furniture to an auctioneer by the. name
of Walker, to whom he said that he would never again have anything to do
with Mrs. Aikenfi and that he was going to San Francisco to look after
some business.

The Health and Police Committee of thei
Board of Supervisors yesterday ordered
that the ambulance which for some
months has been used by the Police De
partment be returned to the Receiving
Hospital. The ambulance was originally
donated to the service of the hospital by
the Doctors' Daughters and was intended
lo be i"-" 1 for the benefit of the sick and
injured and for no other purpose.
The application of the managers of the
National Athletic Club for a return of the

net result being that the money will be re

Hundreds of Sufferers Owe

TESTIMONIALS OF GRATITUDE.
Remarkable Resuits Follow a Few
TreatmentsâChronic Diseases of
All Kinds Absolutely Cured
at 440 Geary Street.
The startling cures effected by Healer
; Francis Truth, as related in detail in
; the papers last Sunday, created a sen-
i sation in this city during the week.
Every reference given in the articles
i alluded to was bona tide, and hundreds
of citizens availed themselves of tbe
j opportunity tp personally investigate
â  the oases published by the press.
During the past week Healer Truth
was the busiest man in California.
Hundreds of visitors thronged his par-
lors daily and astonishing cures were
effected.
The case of Miss Dora Gardmeyer of
Livermore is exciting general attention
to the work of Healer Truth. This
young woman was almost totally deaf
i for many years, and after a few treat-
i merits she was completely restored.
I The publicity giv^n to her case has re-
! suited in a tremendous increase of that
young woman's correspondence, but
now that she has been miraculously
cured of a trying affliction she has no
I complaints to make.
As has been slated by Healer Truth
..11 several occasions to representatives
of the press, he is prohibited by many
of his patients from disclosing their
identity under any circumstances. In
mentioning the more remarkable cases,
therefore,, the initials only may be used,
1 but should Inquirers demand fuller par-
ticulars they may be had by applying
to Healer Truth.
Gilbert Mansfield of 288 Valencia
street, this city, does imt hesitate to
j spenk in praise of Healer Truth, by
: whose efforts he vas absolutely cured
of nervous prostration. Miss Maggie
Qaleman, who lust her voice several
years ago, found it aerain after three or
four treatments by Healer Truth. Mrs.
1 J. LaocE, 322 Seventh street, who used
crutches for six years, because of an
affection of the fcnee joints, was en-
abled to walk unaided after a single
treatment, and after three treatments
discarded her crutches entirely. They
are now in Healer Truth's collection of
j curios.
Mrs. Charles Anchester of Sacra-
mento was cured of partial blindness of
years' standing after six treatments.
Sh>- regarded her case as hopeless, but.
like a drowning person grasping at
i straws, she was persuaded to intrust
; her case to Healer Truth. That sh^
does not regret it her letters to friends
in this city amply demonstrate.
J. A. R. of Healdsburtr writes that he
is improving wonderfully under Healer
: Truth's absent treatments. Having a
touch of almost every disease under the
! sun, the writer was confined to his bed
for nearly a year. After a month's
treatment J. A. H. is on his feet again
and Improving hourly.
L. 6. H., a merchant of Fresno, whose
1 daughter is suffering from quick con-
sumption, that she is almost
cured after two mouths' treatment. "I
never thought to see so wonderful a
change In her," he writes. "I believe
she will now recover her health. If she
does so, I'll be your debtor for life."
Miss B. of c'loverdale fell from a
wagon when a child and lacerated her
left foot. The injuries were not prop-
erly attended to. and a running sore
developed, Which seemed incurable. A
month ago she applied to Healer
Truth for relief. A letter received Fri-
day indicates that the sore has dried
up and no trace of it now remains.
Numerous similar cases mi'Tht be
cited, but these are sufficient to show
the character of the work performed
:by Healer Truth. As already stated.
' he has treated over 3000 cases without
i a single failure, many of them havin.v
' been given up years ago as absolutely
1 incurable. To those who blindly argue
that divine healing is not efficacious
these figures are full of meaning.
The absent cures of Healer Truth are
Increasing daily. It is not necessary to
see the healer, but merely to write to
! him, stating the case In detail. All com.
' munioations are confidentially treated
: and their contents held sacred.

5 past, present and future life, calling your
rriends and enemies by full name. He helps
the unfortunate and lends his power (which
is stronger than that of any medium now
in. San Francisco) to help every caller to
succeed in the realization of their desires.
r Unhappy lovers,, unsuccessful business men.
those inflicted with so-called "incurable '
diseases, will find Professor Dubois a true
; friend who will set them aright and help
â  them to their success and happiness.
No matter what your trouble may be, con-
[ suit Professor Dubois and you will depart
thoroughly satisfied that there is at least
'. one reliable medium now in your city.
Professor Dubois' charges are . moderate,
and within the reach of all. The small fee
of $1 charged on all consultations. Daily
; and Sunday, 10 a. m. to 7 p. m. Absolute
I satisfaction guaranteed. Letters must con-
tain $1 if answer Is expected. Palmistry

FABIOLA DAY
A SUCCESS AT
OAKLAND TRACK
Many Society People
in Attendance.
THE DERBY CAPTURED BY ULM
RANCHO DEL PASO STAKE A
CANTER FOR STAMINA.
Johnny Reiff Piloted Three Winners
Over the Line â Watossa the
Only Outsider to Score.
Cromwell Beaten.
Fabiola day at Oakland track was not
â¢without its features. For the occasion
all complimentary badges were tabooed,
and everybody was requested, to hold a
short monetary conversation with tin
men behind the ticket-sellers' windows.
Only a few stayed away. The regular
Saturday crowd was in attendance, a line
of vehicles graced the infield, and many
of the ultra-fashionable of Oakland so
ciety were observed occupying rustic set
tees and chairs on the lawn is front of
the clubhouse. And the sport itself was
all that could be desired. The track was
not fast, but five favorites were kiml
enough to promenade past the finishing
post in advance of their fields.
The Fabiola derby, the real feature of
the card, attracted a field of ten to the
post, and was captured by Ulm, with the
colored boy Bassinger in the saddle.
Fink's horse carried the big coin bet. at
odds of 8 to 5, and was never headed.
Major Hooker, with Reiff up. made a bid
the; last part, but could not make it good,
finishing second, three lengths behind the
leader. Robert Bonner, the second choice,
proved a rank disappointment.
The Rancho del Paso selling stake, over I
nine furlongs, turned out no race at all. |
Stamina, the good colt from Duke &
Vk'tshard's stable, had nothing to beat, I
winning in a gallop at odds of 1 to 3. Cas
dale downed Malay, the only other
starter, fur second money.
The 8 to 5 favorite Elizabeth R took I
the opening sprint over the Futurity
course without effort. Jenkins, who had I
the mount, allowed Nora Ives to show :
the way for a quarter, and then, shoot- |
ing to the front, downed Somis, a 15 to 1 |
shot, by two lengths. Lothian, a 40 to 1
outsider, finished third.
Master John Reiff's masterly handling i
of Castake landed that horse winner of
the mile event after a long, hard drive
with Cromwell, piloted by Bullman.
Limewater cut out the running to the
bend for home, with Cromwell a close
attendant. The latter horse went wide,
allowing Reiff to get through between
them. At the wire Castake downed
Cromwell half a length in 1:42. Bernar
dillo would not extend himself.
With the fourth event, a selling sprint I
up his sleeve, Macklln on Tiburon, threw
, the race away. The Friar Tuck gelding
was heavily backed at 3 and 4 to 1. and
apparently winning hands down at the
paddock Maeklin grew careless and was
nipped out a nose on the wire by Watossa
The latter closed at odds of 20"to 1 in the
ring and was ridden by Johnny Reiff
Trainer Lee. Williams told his friends
Horatio was right good, and the chestnut
closed a slight favorite over Im
perious for the last race. The latter was
never in the hunt, while Horatio, .n front
from the jump, won with plenty to spare
from Tony Licalzi.
Track Notes.
Johnny Coleman made a losing book up
to the last race.
The entire proceads of the gate yester
day were donated to the Fabiola Hospital
fund.
Bookmaker Frank Eckcrt and Charley
Quinn have for New York by to-night'a

fhnrpe. After resting up for a week both
riders will journey on to St. Louis.
Joe Piggott and Manager George Tuttle
of the Burns & Waterhouse stable will
not leave for St. Louis before May 8.
Master Johnny Reiff is becoming quite
a pet with the ladies. Much applause was
bestowed upon the diminutive rider by

IS EXECUTOR
JOS. SCHWARTZ
AN ABSCONDER?
Has Sailed for Parts
Unknown.
CREDITORS MOURN HIS GOING
THEY CLAIM HE LOOTED
JACOB LETTERS ESTATE.
He Was Cited to Appear in Court, but
San Francisco's Sheriff Has
Been Unable to Serve Him
With Summons.
* Oakland Office San Francisco Tall.
908 Broadway, April 29.
The creditors of the estate of the late
Jacob Letter are considerably exercised
over the sudden departure of Executor
Joseph Schwartz for parts unknown.
Their anxiety is particularly superinduced
!>y the fact that Schwartz, when ap-
I'Ointed by Superior Judge tlisworth on
September 19, lv%, was not required to
give any bond.
Executor Schwartz is wanted now in
Judge Hall's court on a citation issued on
petition of Henrietta Barrett, who charges
that he has wasted and embezzled the
funds of the estate. Petitioner is a cred
itor to the extent of $906.
When the matter '>f the citation was
called to-day Schwartz failed to appear.
Instead the summons was read as re
turned by Sheriff Henry S. Martin of San
Francisco, declaring that Mr. Steen, at
"whose homf, 310 Hyde, street. San Fran
cisco. Schwartz resided, had informed the
I Sheriff thai the executor had "left the
country on the steamer Australia a week
or more ago." The. matter accordingly
went over.
.When Schwartz took hold of the Letter
estate its appraised value was $15,429. con
sisting largely of a stock of clothing in
This city. This stock the executor' sold to
Julius HirshtVrg. and his final account,
recently filed, reads that he received for
the same $4500 in gold coin, when in reality
he received but $1000 cash, the remainder
iznlnir to the cancellation of a claim held
by Hirshln-rg against the estate in the
sum of $3500. As a result Schwartz has
failed to pay to the other creditors the
. lividend ordered by the court some time
L v. and in reality the estate is now in
.- livent.

EAGLESON NOW DECLINES.
He Would Not Act as Guardian of

Names Mrs. C. L. Tilden. '
OAKLAND, April 29.â The contest over
the guardianship of Rose E. yon Schmidt.,
who with her four little brothers was
made an orphan by the murder of the
mother and suicide of the father in Ala
meda on April 9. has been robbed of its
promised sensation.
Robert Eagleson late this afternoon
filed his declination to qualify or serve as
Rose's guardian. He requests that the
girl's aunt, Mrs. Charles L. Tilden of
Alameda, be appointed in his stead. Mr:
Eagleson was named as guardian in the
mother's will, and the paternal grand
parent. Colonel A. W. yon Schmidt, last
week also applied for the appointment, al
leging that Eagleson is not a fit and
proper person to have care and control of
Rose. ' â 
Public Administrator B. C. Hawes to
day filed a petition for letters of adminis
tration on the estate of E. A. yon Schmidt,
the latter's father having filed a similar
petition last week. The estate is valued
at about $3500 and consists of several Ala
meda water front lots.

meet on. board the flagship Cygnus at
10:30. On signal from the flagship the
yachts will stand over, to the city
front and will cruise along it in com
pany. Commodore Allen M. Clay has
issued an order directing the yachts
of the California Club to take "col
ors" from the San Francisco flagship
and thereafter to follow Commodore
Hill's signals till the close of the
cruise. Though no express order to
this effect has been given by Commo

also cruise to the city front and there
after to Vallejo in company with the
San Franciscos. The combined cruise
bids fair to be attended by a larger

seen in company on the bay, except on
the occasion of a regatta or cruise of

A number of shipowners have been dis
appointed over the British ship Belfast
She is a splendid modern vessel and was
j for sale, and a number of people contem

rived that she had been sold in England
for $33,000. The Belfast is now out 106
days from Calcutta ior San Franciscoâ

The trouble between the shipowners and
the Sailors' Union continues. The vessels
are delayed a little, but they sail with
non-union crews and at non-union wages
nevertheless. The ship Columbia got
away for Vladivostok, and the barken-
Une Jane L. Stanford for Puget Sound to
load lumber for Sydney, all right. Four
men were taken out of the barkentine. but
two of them went back on her again, say

WATER FRONT TALE OF WOE
THREATENED WITH VIOLENCE

Day of Struggle and Toil Because
the Master of the Occidental
Wished to Cut Contract
Wages.
A salt-water soaked seaman, accompa
nied by Secretary A. Furuseth of the
Seamen's Union, made complaint at the
Harbor police station yesterday after
noon that he was detained on the ship Oc
cidental against his will, and that he was
I to swim for his freedom or work
for less money than his contract called
for. His complaint contained many other
counts, some of which are sensational
enough for the up-rearing of a wtiten
front romance founded upon violence and
i impressment.
Fritz Gi'len, able-bodied seaman and
victim, told the following woeful story
while the bay water fell from his clothes
in streams:
"I shipped to-day on the Occidental on
:an agreement of $.Â» a month. I was not
i completely sober at the time, hut I am
; sure of the figures. When I reached the
ship I found nut that my wages were to
| be $3u a month. and I insisted upon going
ashore. This was refused me.
"Pretty soon after this a tug came
: alongside ttte Occidental and I jumped
: from the ship to the tug. The captain of
j the tug was ordered to deliver me up by
: the master of the ship. Being frightened
! I jumped overboard, and started to swim
I for shore. A Whitehall, not far distant
i and coming toward me caused me to
change my course. I reached the white
hail and put my hands on the gunwale.
: when I was surprised by the boatman,
! who tried ii, beat me off. I recognized
[ him as the fellow who had carried me
to the Occidental in the first place and
| had induced me to ship for $35 per month.
He wanted me to return to the ship which
1 I had- just left.
"Finally I got in the boat. and. to my
utter consternation, the boatman rowed
back to the ship. He would have put me
in; lu>ard but for the opposition of some
: yf the crew, who threatened him should
he come alongside. The captain of the
1 then told the boatman to take me
ashore, which he did. When I reached
the dock the fellow knocked me down and
threatened to ha%-e me arrested for burn
ing the ship if I mentioned a word of
what happened. I then sought the advice
!of A. Furuseth. secretary of the union,
j and he took me to the Harbor police sta
| tion, but 1 could not get any assistance
I there. My clothes are aboard the
and I want them very badly."
S< a man Gillen was looking for a Police
Judge last night with the purpose of
| swearing out a batch of warrants against
! the men who had maltreated him. The
, Occidental is booked to sail this morning.

SENATOR PERKINS' FRIENDSHIP FOR U. S. GRANT

Language Committed

LECTURE INCIDENT REVIVED
THE SENATOR SAYS IT WAS
SQUARED.
Pennsylvania Influences Are Active

George C. Perkins. United States Sen
ator, returned from Southern Califor
sterdaj morning. The fact Is
veil known that a little incident which

durii ation has
n unusual amount of*gossip in

for years in the Senate. The Gover

but cordial. In view of the fact that

The impression is not cor
rect that the Governor had in mind
the lecture which Senator Perkins de
livered shortly after his return from
Washington, wherein reference was
to th~ veto of many hills at Sac
nto. When it was suggested to the
Senator that the Governor's allusion to
: ir White's excellent service in
Congress was in retaliation for Sena-
Perklns* allusion to the wisdom of
President McKinley, the Senator re
ferred to a correspondence between
himself and Prlvat< Secretary Poley on
that subject. It appears that The Call's
account of the lecture caused
comment in political circles. Senator
Perkins does not contend that The
- report of the lecture was i
rect, or even misleading, but he holds
that a construction at variance with
what h>- intended was placed upon his i
lage. What he Intended was to
bring to the attention of the audience
th>- fact that bo much care was exer
cised by the Senate of the United States
in considering measures of legislation

ULCERS FOR

Eleven on One Limb at One Time
With Excruciating Pain. All
Remedies Tried, and Number-
less Physicians Little Benefit.
CUTICURA Speedily Cures.
My mother has been a victim to ulcers from
varicose veins for thirty-five years. Eleven of
these terrible sores have existed at one time on
the limb affected. Excruciating pain and intense
suffering were endured, with all sorts of remedies
on trial and numberless physicians' calls and
prescriptions applied, but all practically with
but little benefit. However, at last the remedial
agent was found in Ccticcra (ointment), which
â¢nroly proved its weight in gold, alleviating pain
and causing healing processes to commence and
a cure speedily effected. She has, also, used
Cuticcka with marked benefit in erysipelas
of the face and eczema. The Cuticuba Soap,
also, has established a record only as the best
cleansing, purifying, and healfng in its nature,
having proved itself a most excellent and valu-
able auxiliary to the Cuticura (ointment).
I would remark that this testimonial is entirely
unsolicited, being a voluntary contribution for
humanity's sake, and the commendation of the
Cuticura Remedies to the fullest confidence,
being satisfied of their purity, genuineness, and
almost miracles wrought.

It is somewhat difficult to ascertain
what did take place between the Gov
ernor and Senator after this report of
the lecture was published. A corre
spondence ensued and the impression is
i hat 11 ended in the exchange of re
ciprocal sentiments of great esteem and
admiration. It is believed that Perkins
congratulated Cage on his great sue
â¢ ess as a reform Governor, whose vigi
lance in the cause of the people was
worthy of the highest commendation.
It is surmised that thÂ»- Governor con
gratulated Perkins on his devotion to
the interests of California as demon
strated by his record in the United
States Senate, adding praise for the
Senator's great learning and ability as
a statesman. From all accounts the
reconciliation, if any ill feeling did ex
ist, was complete and the incident was
closed. Perhaps The Call made a mis
take in publishing an account of the
lecture. It may have been designed as
a private affair. likÂ»- the recent railroad
banqu< t at the Palace Hotel.
Senator Perkins will not entertain
the proposition for an instant that the
lecture had anything to do with the
snub at San Pedro. H>- adheres to the
notion that his friendship for Cram
was the cause of the assault. Th>
fact that Grant was not chosen Sena
tor does not in the slightest degree
diminish Senator Perkins* admiration
for the San Diego statesman. Again
reference was made to the fact that
Mr. Grant graduated from Yale College
and the Columbia Law School and was
subsequently Assistant District At
torney of New York. In conversation,
referring to the recent contest at Sac
ramento, Milton Green was mentioned,
but the Senator did not say from what
school he graduated.
When Senator Perkins was asked
about the Quay case and the probable
action ol' the United States Senat>- on
the appointment by the Governor the
Senator replied that the editorial article
in The Call of Saturday morning, April
2.*. siatt-d the case i orrectly and clearly.
i He remarked that influences in Penn
sylvania had been employed to enlist
the support of Senators in Quay's be
half. "In discussing this Question I
open the way for attack on myself. I
voted to seat Corbett because he was
a Pacific ("oast man and we needed
strength in the Senate. In Oregon,
recollect, the Legislature did not or
ganize and the State Senate refused to
vote. Should I declare myself opposed
to the seating of Quay 1 would )><â 
charged with seeking to control all the
patronage. If Quay gets his seat under
the appointment by the Governor it
logically follows that the Senators ap
pointed to represent Delaware, Califor
nia and Utah must be seated."
An inspired prophet is not needed to
predict that Senator Perkins will be
a candidate to succeed himself in the
T'nited States Senate four years hence.
When spoken t<> on that topic during
his recent trip south he remarked: "I
have known Perkins a long time, and
think he is just the man for the place."
Artistic Work.
The wainscoting in the Majestic sa
lr.on, 914 Market street, is the most art
istic piece of artificial marble work ever
executed on this coast, and requires an
expert to tell the difference from the gen-
Uini marble, as it Is constructed from
slabs' and erected in the same manner, and
can be taken down at any time, the same
as any marble work, without destroying.
There is no comparison between this work
and that in. the Examiner building, which
to be repaired must first be destroyed.
Mr. <;. < "Ijiolloni, the artist who has exe
cuted this work, has certainly attained ru
markable results. The satisfaction that
this new feature of Interior finish has al
ready given is ample evidence that arti
ficial marble will become a prominent
{actor in the construction of future build
ings of the coast, as it can be utilized for
about one-half the cost, and retains, the
beauty and finish of the original stone.

Concocted by a Bunch
of Dizzy Girls.
CRACKER FACTORY ROMANCE
TELEGRAPH HILL DAMSELS IN
VENTED THE CANARD.
Miss Viola Jeffres Wrote the Soulful
Letters and Jennie Lind
Bought the Carbolic
Acid.
The Police Department and Coroner Hill
may cease to bother their brains about
tin Ocesm Beach mystery, for Mrs. Tom
Bozzle is but a creature of fiction that
sprung from the minds of a bunch <>f
flighty Telegraph Hill damsels who spend
', nnst of their time glazing sweet cakes
in a, North Beach cracker factory. Weary
of then- sedentarj occupation the girls,
none of whom are >vÂ«r is years of age,
I decided to hand out to this unsuspecting
public something which would create
more of a sensation than a wheat cake
or a glngersnap. So they all pot together
at the residence of .Mis.- Agnes McCarron
I ai 4298 Green street, where .Miss Viola
Jeffres of 1306 Montgomery street Bug
gested the plot of the weird mystery that
ha.- kept the authorities on the gui vlve
sine, Thursday last.
Viola Jeffres was the literary beacon
|of the aggregation of cracker factory
! mechanics. She has read muri; than one
I of Laura Jean Libbey's tales of pyro
technic love, and scribbled off the heart-
I rending letters found on the beach last
; Thursday morning just as easily as she
signs the pay roll for the "three per,
that she earns at the cracker factory. The
tetters were written early in the week
and the rest of the girls then set about
to gather up the clothing and other trin
kets which were needed to lend a tinge
; of genuine mystery to ineir prank.
Jennie Und was delegated to purchase
1 the bottle of carbolic acid and she imme
diately flounced down to Wessenberg'a
drug store at Montgomery avenue and
Filbert street, where she bought the
drug. The druggist lid not know the girl
and as she came Into the store when he.
was very l^usy waiting on other custom
ers he did not notice her particularly.
Nellie McCarty anil a little chap named
O'Brien, whom the girls took into their
confidence, scraped together the tintypes,
the picture ami the leather purse and hat.
and then the home-made mystery was all
I ready to be dropped on the .sands of the
beach.
Mamie McGlinchey, another cracker
factory miss, who is not yet out of her
teens, was delegated to carry the mystery
I to the beach. The young lady took a day
off and was up bright anil early Thurs
day morning. O'Brien, who plays the
. part of the villain iii tbe dope mystery,
met i he maid on one of the ragged <t,:-is
of San Francisco's airy perch, and. taking
the precious bun. lie, they started for the
! beach. The ride out was uneventful, and
when the pair arrived the beach was for
! tunately deserted. They spread the mys-
I tery on the sands and then made haste
for the first inward-hound car.
After the story of the supposed suicide
of their fanciful Mrs. Bozzle was given
[ widesprend publicity the girls became
frightened, and they held another meet-
I ing. and all were sworn to strict secrecy.
The story, however, was noised about the
neighborhood for the past two days, and
the girls strongly suspect O'Brien of tip
The day will be a memorable one
for the parishioners. At the 8 o'clock
mass 300 boys and girls will receive
their first communion; at 11 o'clock
the Redemptorist Fathers will inaug
urate a mission for women, and at 4
o'clock the Most Rev. Archbishop
Riordan will adrfllnister confirmation
to 300 children.
The changes in the architectural dec
orations of the church have been ex
ping It off to a corner grocery man or
somebody else. When seen by a Call re
porter last night one of the young ladies
admitted that the mystery was concocted
by them, and she defended their actions
by saying that things were so deucedly
flat In the cracker factory that they sim
ply wanted to stir up a mild sensation.
All of them are now on the stool of re
pentance.
"THE MAJESTIC'S" OPENING.

"The Majestic"' surpasses them all tor
beauty and comfort Its owners have
Bpared no expense in fitting, the place
up, and as a result they haw a right to
feei proud of their acquisition.
As one enters the place he is at once
struck with the beauty and appointments
oi' the bar. Handsome mirrors, bronze
statuary and shining glassware are
thrown out in splendid relief by the
carved mahogany that was used In Its
construction. Nickel and brass were used
in finishing it off and is in perfect har
mony with it. The walls are covered
with Pegemoid. the .Mdes with Skagiola
and the ceiling is brilliantly decorated in
rococo. Paintings of merit value adorn
the wails are one if the main attrac
tions in the place. There are pictures by
A. Humborg of Munich. P. Burrucci of
Rome, A. Zoppi of Rome and other fa
mous artists. The masterpieces are
shown off to advantage by lights cleverly
thrown on them. The nooks are gems
in their way and are richly furnished.
Privacy is obtained behind costly drapery.
Below stairs are 'en of the coziest
rooms Imaginable. The music; room or
banquel hall is a large, well ventilated
apartment, handsomely furnished. Judg
ing by its comfortable appearance it
promises to be very popular with the
patrons of "The Majestic. All the rooms
are richly carpeted and furnished.
The patrons to the private apartments
can be served with steaks, chops, succu
lent oysters, and "The Majestlc's" only
specialty, "boiled salt mackerel."
A stairway leading from the Ellis street
side of the cafe insures privacy to those
Wishing to avoid going through the front
way.
A feature of "The Majestic"' is that It
is a ten-cent house. This has long been
waited by the drinking public, and as the
liquids offered for that price are the best
that money can buy and are served In a
palace it is more than likely to spring into
immediate popularity.
Messrs. waldron and Nason are known
throughout the State as genial and whole

slate roof has been substituted on the
body of the edifice and also on the
spire. Painters are at present labor-
Ing over the last outside touches, and
their work has made tho historic
house of God look new.
The great transformation is due to
interior renovations. The handsome
central altar has been regilded and
retouched, and is now one of the most
beautifully decorated altars in this
country. Two elegant side altars,
each costing $750, of the same de
sign as the main altar, have
been donated by the parish Sodali
ties: one. the ,'iltar of tin- Blessed
Virgin, was presented by the Children
of Mary: the other, the altar of* St.
Joseph, was given by the Living Ro
sary Society. The general character
of the interior decorations is such as
light and cheerful coloring gives to
massive pillars, arches and naves. The
frescoing is in harmony with the mar
blelsed columns and the gorgeously
gilded central altar. Six new confes
sionals and new oak pews â¢ complete
the furnishings.
A special feature in the remodeled
church is the illumination. Around
the arches and naves are studded my
riads of incandescent electric lights.
Five handsome statues have been pre

BONFIRES ON TWIN PEAKS.
Federation of Improvement Clubs
Will Illuminate on Dewey Day.
At a meeting of the Federation of Mis
sion Improvement Clubs held last night
at South San Francisco it was decided to
have two big bonfires started on the Twin
Peaks to-morrow night in honor of Dewey
! day.
To accomplish this achievement the fol
lowing were appointed a committee: Gus
i Schnee. Christ Stader, A. S. Lillie, Dr.
: E. N. Torello, H. E. Griffith, F. A. Hack-
I ney, W. Watson. Thomas O'Neil. W.
; Lewiri and A. Nonnemann. An invitation
. , was extended to Mayor Phelan to climb
i the peaks and start the fires.
â  Having disposed of this patriotic act in
honor of the Manila victory, the federa
j tlon got all tangled up in an attempt by
: : some of the members to throw the or
; ganization into politics by recommending
that the several Mission clubs form them
selves into political clubs. The scheme
! was defeated by having the resolution re
ferred back to the executive committee
for pruning.
The executive committee offered a reso
i lution congratulating tht people on their
victory as gained by trie recent acts of
the city authorities in extending the pole
ordinance to outside limits and obtaining
a reduction in the gas rates.
Property owners on the line of Duncan
! and Valencia streets requested the aid
i of the federation in having Duncan street
I opened from San Jose avenue to Valencia
street. The request was referred to the
ex< cutlve committee, with instructions to |
urge the petitioners to form an improve
ment club in that section.
Gustave Schnee, chairman of the execu
tive committee, introduced the following
resolution, which was unanimously
adopted: ,
Resolved, By the Federation of Mission Im
provement Clubs, in meeting assembled, thia
â d'Ah day of April, 3 S'.iS. that we heartily .-,.ni
niend the movement that has been undertaken
by the press and the better element oÂ£ the
community for the suppression of the gambling
dens on our city's main thoroughfare, ami
further hope that the Police Commissioners
will continue to take a personal interest In the
movement and give the entire Police Depart
ment to understand that the gamblers must be
driven out and compelled to earn an honest
livelihood.

missioners that they Rh<>uld make any
disturbance there. The population of
the Seal Rocks is bul an Infinitesimal
fraction of the whole sea lion nib.- in
tills neighborhood. As popular knowl
edge of the sea lion is mainly derived
from these little points of rock this is
not realized and neither is the nt-.-d
and wisdom of the measures about to
be taken. There are never mure than a
f'W dozen or a few score sea lions and
their cousins out there, while elsewhere
within thirty or forty mi!<-y there are
many thousands. Wh a lever the
slaughter, there will still be sea lions to
look arfrom the cliff balcony.
For twenty or thirty years the fish
ermen generally, and the salmon pack
ers of the Sacramento especially, have
been complaining of the sea lions and
praying for their destruction. This
same agitation has bobbed up periodi
cally. Fish Commissions have heard
delegations, dlsoussed, resolved and re
ported over and over again, and the
verdict hns always been that the soa
lion destroys enormous quantities of
tish, Beriously interferes with the fish
ing Industry hereabouts, especially the
salmon industry, and that his number
should be lessened. But the pea lion has
been protected by law, and each agita
tion lias died without result.
Since 1866 there has been a State law
which prohibits molesting these ani
mals within a mile of the beach about
the Cliff House or within one mile of
the shore for a distance of ten miles
along the Santa Cruz coast. It happens
that outside of these limits the rooker
ies, including the main population, are
on Government lighthouse or other
reservations, and here a Treasury De
partment regulation forbids hunting.
The idea now is to get the permission
of the Treasury Department to send
men into the big rookeries on the Far
allon Jslands, thirttf-milea &t sea, Point
Reyes, Point Arena and Ano Nuevo, or
New Years Point, down on the San
Mateo County shore, during the breed
s' it; .season and kill the animals in large
numbi is.
A petition, indorsed by Senator Per
kins, asking for this permission, was
sent to Secretary Gage the other day.
and President Vogelsang of the Fish
Commission is quite confident that the
permission will be granted. If the Gov
ernment does not hesitate too long, but
gives its early consent, the slaughter
will commence next month, when the
breeding season is fairly begun and
the greatest number of seals have con
gregated.
The exact method to be pursued has
not been determined, but that is a mere
detail. Deputies and some hired rifle
men may be sent out to do the work,
and. as is most likely, the work may
be done under some sort of a contract
arrwMcenjent jplth^-BklUed men.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, APRIL 30, 1899.
There 1b no. qurstlo-n that if the sea
lion Is a luxury he Is a costly nne. He
eats an incredible amount of fish. Years
Â«?n two Bea lions were long in captivity
at Woodward's Gardens, and each
would eat from forty to fifty pounds
of fish a clay. When it is pood fishing
for sea lions thousands of them in and
about the bay eat that much daily.
Their population along the middle coast
of the State nn be obly guessed at.
Commissioner Vogelsang's estimate of
25,000 may be wrong either way. But
10,000 sea lions eating fifty pounds of
fish a day would consume 500,000 pounds
daily. The habit of the animal, how
ever, is to keep on catching fish when
he gets about full, take a bite out of
each one and throw the rest away. The
estimate must be greatly raised for this
reason.
Each one easily gorges himself and
then entertains himself with catching
more, taking a- bite out of the back or.
kelly and throwing the rest of the fish
away, only now and then can one be
Rppn, l>ut a deputy commissioner states
that a few months aso he watched a
F^a lion in the Sacramento River play
ing with a salmon like a cat with a
mouse. He was evidently not. hungry.
He would stick his head above water,
toss i ho fish hiph in the air to one eide,
dive and catch the fish in his mouth
wlinn it came down. The last time the
fish came down endwise and the lion
just held his mouth open and let it
shoot down his throat.
As the animals are rarely observed
it Is circumstantial evidence that is
lnrgely relied upon by the salmon
fishers. This is presented in part by
their nets. Nets costing from $100 to
$400 are constantly found destroyed.
The sea lions find a net full of fish
and naturally presume that the provi
dence which provided th<'m salmon
took the trouble to catch some for
them. When the big dinner of fish is
gone the nets are pone too, and the
fishers loudly curse the sea lion.
This indicated sea lion is the best
known member of an interesting fam
ily. What are popularly known as se-ils
are the genus otariidae. They are of
two classes the hair seals. kn.^>wn as
sea lions, and the fur seals, the- latter
being of sm;.iler size. There are five
recognized species of hair seals or
Bea iions and four of the fur seals. The
hair r^oal h;;s no soft fur under his
coarse, hard, hairy covering, and is of
small economic importance. For this
reason largely the sea lions hayÂ« never
been carefully studied by scientists,
and indeed it is only in ouite recent
years that the fur sÂ«al has been so
studied.
Thp sea lion occurs throughout the
Pacific Coast from Cape Horn to Bering
Sea and along the Asiatic Coast. Thp
well-known California sea lion has been
observed and written about more than
any other species, mainly because it
lias been morn convenient to those who
cared to observe lions. Because it
h;iÂ« been a more convenient victim of
capture it has also been the one gen
erally exhibited in zoological pardons
everywhere and there studied and pic
tured. Ti is th^ California eea lion that
lias been exhibited at Central Park.
New York, at tho zoological gardens of
Philadelphia and nthpr Eastern cities,
and in the zoological collections of
Pnris. London and other capitals.
The California sea linn occurs from a
point southward variously placed at
Lower California and the Mexican
coast to half way to Bering Pea. As
large and magnificent as is the Califor
nia sea lion, he is smaller than the
Bpeciea that populates the northern re
sorts, and especially the Pribylof and
Aleutian islands, where his Importance
is lost In that of the fur seal. It is re
ported that 20.000 sea lions permanently
lnhablt the Pribylof Islands. All sea
Ikms display a considerable range of
yellowish or reddish brown color and
the male is always of two to three times
the size of the female. The Farallon
Islands are Riven as the southern limit
at which the northern sea lion occurs,
and breeds so that the two species min
gie here somewhat.
While the California sea lion is the
predominating species at the California
seal resorts, there are others, and the
average observer will fail to detect the
different species. The true fur seal was
formerly quite abundant along the Cali
fornia coast between the Bering Sea
bueeding seasons, and since its practical
extermination a few stray ones are
often present here. The spotted or bar
ber seal and the gray seal also frequent
the California resorts of the otaries.
The sea elephant, formerly fairly
abundant, is also an occasional visitor.
These other species have their stories,
but the California sea lion is the main
character at present, and when Dr.
Jordan put in a plea of guilty in behalf
of the sea lion as a fish destroyer he
acquitted the others.
A good specimen of a bull will weigh
a ton. and some are judged to reach 3000
pounds. Their lengths are from 14 to 20
feet. Though so clumsy on land, they
arÂ« no lonir^r clumsy In the wate*.
There is enormous power in the mus
cles of their flippers ami tails, and this
and the build <>f their lithe hodies
makes them wonderfully dextrous in
the boiling surf by thÂ« jagged rocks
they climb and wond< .fully dextrous
and swift in overtaking the speediest
fish nf the sea they swim.
Their principal food is fish, hut they
also feed Dn in. 'Husks, crustaceans and
sea birds. An observant writer for The
Call, who visited the rookeriefs at New
Year's Point, on the coast of San Ma
teo County, in 1897 during the breeding
season, saw a greal school of fish pass
through a channel between two of the
rocky islands the sea lions populated.
The 'lions plunged from the ro<-ks by
hundreds and crowded each other at
the feast. They were quickly filled,
and thru they followed their habit of
taking a bite out of each fish they
caught, and later the water was cov
ered with dead floating fish.
The family life of the sea lion is es
pecially Interesting, and it is this fam
ily life that is planned to be invaded
with powder, ball and steel. It is not
so fine and systi n the br< edfng
grounds as that of the fur seal, but it
is quite similar. The bn eding season
opens with the landing al th" breeding
grounds of the strongest males. For
three weeks or so they simply pre
empi territory and fight.
Tho hnttlos arc terribly ferocious, and
even the victor may have much hide
torn into strips and an eye torn out.
The defeated ones and the "bachelors* 1
go elsewhere. Dr. Jordan says It is
mainly these that populate Seal Rocks.
The breeding s.'hs"u begins in May
and tho masters of tin- harems are
about to install themselves now. These
males go without food for a month or
more. living on their own fat. Then the
female? arrive, and during June and
July -ihr young are bom and nursed
and taught to swim. A striking degree
of matrrnal care and lovp is exhibited
and even the males help teach the
young. The mothers go out after food,
nurse their young and early lead them
into the surf. The mother win hold
it r pup's nose above Water in its first
lessons at swimming, will play with
it in the water, takine it now and then
by the nnpe of the ivok and throwing
it. to carefully catch it when it alights,
and will go away from the surf and
float on the surface with its pup lying
on its breast.
If the sea linn was worth hunting
there would bo no call for official ex
termination. He was worth hunting
once years ago. The white man began
it when ho first got here. The prizes
were the coarse hides and the fat for
oil for domestic markets and the
whiskers and some other small parts
of the carcass for the Chinese market.
They were slain by the thousands up
to ten or fifteen years ago all along the
coast, from Lower California north.
Then the market for the hides and oil
passed away and the whiskers, etc,
for the Chinese market would not pay
for the trouble and expense of killing
them. This and the legal restrictions
have given the sea lion a chance. The
Government's prohibitions were not to
piotect the sea Hon. The regulation
w.is made because the hunters of sea
lions, gulls' eggs, etc., at the Farallones
and on other reservations got up such
bloody wars and stole, wrecked or in
terfered with so much (invernment
property and so much Government
business that the thing was a nuisance
to be abated. It is this fact that gives
President Vogelsang confidence that
the request of State officers will be
granted.
If it is a romantic and picturesque
campaign will .be promptly inaugur
ated. The sea lions will be greatly les
sened but not exterminated. President
Jordan indorses the campaign and says
that if ninety-nine of every hundred
males were killed the race would still
be all right and there would be many
fish saved. It is said that the war will
be made on the males. Probably it
will, but the purpose is to reduce the
herds during the breeding season, and
it is possible that some mothers and
pups will accidentally suffer.
President Jordan takes great Interest
in the matter and will visit the rook
eries while the war la .waged.18
IS MARY B. EDDY THE PROPHETESS OF CHRISTIAN SCIENCE?
Her Personality
Bitterly Attacked
By Old Energies.
A CONTROVERSY* has broken out
in Boston over the question as to
who is entitled to the somewhat
doubtful honor of having founded,
that system of "healing" (the
, . printer Is Instructed to make the
quotation marks as emphatically con
spicuous as the sarcastic resources of the
typographical art will permit)â that sys
tem of "healing," then, which is known
as Christian science, and which IS re
sponsible for the death of Harold Fred
oric and the continued valetudinarianism
of many less noted individuals. Was Mrs.
Mary Eddy the inventor, creator or foun
der of this boon or this bane.?
She "claims' that (quotation ' marked)
"honor." In the forthcoming (May) num
ber of the Arena, however, will appear
a couple of signed. articles in which her
claim is contested in favor of the late
Phineas Parkhurst Qulmby. The writers
insist thai the prophetess who demands
"honor" in her own country is simply an
abject follower and plagiarist of a prophet
who met the proverbial fate of all proph
ets. He was the Columbus who discov
ered the land of promise. She was the
Amerigo Vespucci who gave it her name.
The first of these writers is Horatio W.
Dresser, whose father was an intimate
friend of the aforesaid and unhoi
Quimby, and a* such has had access to
the papers of thai benefactor of his kind.
The second is Josephine Curtis Woodbury,

The Leading Facts.
Mr. Dresser starts out by constituting
these as the facts of leading importance:
Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy, formerly Mrs.
Mary Mason Patterson of Sanbornton
Bridge; N. H., is regarded by many thou
sands of faithful followers as the orig
inator by "divine revelation" in 1866 of the
philosophy and practice of mental or
spiritual healing, best known in its sec
tarian phase as ''Christian science.'
The lollowerafcof the movement recog
nize only â !:. authority Of Mrs. Eddy, and
the Bible as interpreted in her text books;
other literature on the subject is prohibit
ed, and her followers are not permitted
to Dilate with other organizations. Mrs.
Eddy is compared to Christ, whose face is
made to resemble hers in a picture where
the two stand side by Side; her words are
deemed the words of the divlnest author
ity, and although she has probably not
been a well man for over forty years,
she. is believed by her disciples to be per
fectly sound and true. The chief tenets
of her doctrine are that there is but one
principle or spirit in the universe, that
"all is mind, there is no matter," "all is
good, there is no evil," and that conse
quently by those who know this abstract
"truth all seeming evil and disease are
dismissible as "errors of mortal mind."
It is useless, then, to complain to a be
liever in this doctrine that one is suffer
ing, or to ask how one shall succor the
poor; for one Is emphatically informed
that there Is no suffering, "there are no
poor."
Quimby the Discoverer.
If now we ask. "Whence came the truth
in the doctrine, so far as it has proved
helpful as a principle of cure, and how
does it chance to be intermingled with ir
rationality and fanaticism? we find that
Christian science had two sources; only
a tain peculiarly worded interpretation
of the great truths of mental hea'lrg is
original with Mrs. Eddyâ the truth itself
was rediscovered by Dr. P. P. Quimby
(ISO 2-1566); who not only restored Mr.= .
Eddy, then Mr Patterson, to partial
health in th<> autumn of 1562. after six
years of Invalidism; but also freely shared
with her ideas which afterward formed
thn element of truth in her special "rev
elation."

public statement,
Julius A. Dresser Appears.
Mr. Dresser's father, .Julius a. Dresser
was a patient and follower of Dr Quim
l'v in Portland, lie., from Juno. ifc6o and
n Portland when Mrs. Kddv then
Mrs. Patterson, came from Hill n'h to
receive treatment "He owed the thir'tv
rs of his Ufe following mo to
J>r. Qiiimby, whose ideas he ardcntlv es
poused and often explained to new na
llents, among them Mrs. Eddy. The first
mention of Mrs. Eddy in my father's
Journal Id i October 17, 1862, and my mother,
Annette G. Dresser, who was cured by
Dr. Qulmby after six years of hopeless
invalidism. was present when Mrs. Eddy
was assisted up the steps to Dr Quim
by's office. I have had the acquaintance
of those who copied all of Dr. Quimby's
manuscripts from the original, and have
recently had access to letters written by
Mrs. Eddy between 1862 and 1866." Mr
Dresser's facts are, therefore, first hand
and he tolls us that he could if
necessary, substantiate by competent
witneses and legal testimony all that he
now feels called upon to state.
Nine Indictments.
(\) Mrs. Eddy was never the secre
tary of Dr. Quimby, this office having
been filled by the- Misses Ware and
Mr. George A. Quimby.
(2) Hr Qulmby was not the author
of "Science and Health." which was
not published until 1875, nine years
after Dr. yulmby's death. His 'most
ardent frjunds would claim for him
only the discovery of the truth of
thought power, of a causative influ
ence in the production and cure of
disease and of the method of silent
treatment during the years 1838-1865;
thÂ«> ideas were his and frequently the
language in which the science was de
scribed by Mrs. Eddy; but the pub
lished writings of Mrs. Eddy were
never claimed to have been written by
Dr. Quimhy in their final form.
(?,) Mr. Dresser's father lent Mrs
Eddy his copy of the first volume of
Dr. Quimby's manuscripts, which she
may have copied for herself. The
articles in this volume wre written in
T>r>;i-1860 and were followed by articles
written in 1861-1865, which M*rs. Eddy
probably never saw, but which the
deponent has been familiar with since
I*3. These articles contain a full
statement of Dr. Quimby's theory,
with abundant incidents drawn from
his practice, references to the Blblo
and Illustrations from the Civil War,
in progress while they were written
The style is very unlike that of Mrs.
Kildy, who never could have written
im. No onÂ« who should read them
would doubt the power and sincerity
of their author.
(4) The first statement made in the
Christian Science Sentinel of February
16. 1R99, that these manuscripts may
have been left with Dr. Qulmby "years
ago" has no -foundation whatever in
truth. That they could not have been
"stolen from my (Mrs.- Eddy's) pub
lished works," as Mrs. Eddy suggests,
Mr. Dresser says he is ready absolute
ly to prove. The Quotations from
these writings which Mrs. Eddy says
"were my own words, as near as I
can recollect them.". -were from an ar
ticle written by Dr. Quimby in ISG3.
copied by Mr. Dresser himself into a
book which Mrs. Eddy never saw,
from the manuscript book of Dr.
Quimby's writings, copied from the
original, not a page of which Mrs. Eddy
ever saw. The statements of 'Eu
gene Greene." quoted in the Sentinel,
that Dr. Quimby "requested us to
transform" his "scribbllngs," "which
wo did." are also wholly false. These
statements entirely misrepresent Dr.
Quimby's practice and teaching and
his relationship with Mrs. Eddy. Dr.
Quimby did term his theory the "Sci
ence of Health." He also used the
term "Christian Science."
i.'ii No stranger who has visited Mr.
Quimby to procure his father's writ
ing's has. or ever will have, the slight
est success. But the fact that they
will not be published verbatim, < x
under certain conditions not y ( t ful
fUled, is obviously no reason t'>r "dar
ing" their owner t" Issue them; there
â¢ too many who know of thi lr char
acter to doubt that they are precisely
as represented.
(6) As for the statements In >â¢ >urt of
l>r. E. J. Xrens, referred to in the
Christian Sci< 3< men
tioned, Mr. Dresser knew Dr. Arena
and knows also that he never saw Dr.
Qulmby. and that nothing has ever
been settled In court concerning tl.>-
Quimby manuscripts.
(7) The extracts quoted from Dr.
Quimby in th" Sentinel an from
of his earlier articles, and do not
quately represent him. !!<â  held a very
exalted Idea of God, quite superior
to that of Mrs. Eddy; he did not deny

later manuscripts, because she never
saw the best of them; Dr. Quimby was
not a spiritualist, and Mrs. Eddy pub
licly defended him against the charge
in Warren. Me., In the spring of 1864;
he did not teach that his treatment
was due to the transmission of elec
tricity; he discarded mesmerism many
years before Mrs. Eddy visits! him as
a patient in 1862; and the "discovery"
of Mrs. Eddy In 1806 was simply the
fact that after Dr. Quimby's death.
with no one likely to Bucceed him, she
must depend upon herself, since her
revered teacher and nHper could no
longer lie called uoon, as formerly, to
help her out of every little ailment.
(M The Sentinel quotes a letter from
Mrs. Eddy as follows:
"The following extract copied from a
letter to me recently received from a
well-known Christian Scientist may at
least amuse the readers of our journal.
After doing justice to this subject I
had dropped it, as we naturally turn
away from a fossilized falsehood.
Hut evidence and testimony on the
side of truth are always in order, and
proverbially better late than never.

Mrs. Eddy says:

certainly read like words that I said

Points in Dispute.
The truth, according to Mr. Dresser, Is
that Dr. Quimby left Portland in 1865 to
rewrite his manuscripts for publication,
but died before they were In any respect
in shape to offer to a publisher. The state
ment that "he tried to get them published
and failed" is absolutely false. Equally

false is the statement that Mrs. Eddy
helped Dr. Quimby in any way. "The at
tempt, repeatedly made, to show that
Mrs. Eddy taught Dr. Quimby is utterly
baseless, and Mrs. Eddy knows that in
Bach statements, and in her effort to
shew that he was a mere mesmerist, who
once controlled her, she entirely misrep
resents one whom she once compared to
J. -stis and whom it was once her pleasure
to defend."
The statement has been made that Mrs.
Eddy was never Mrs. Patterson, and con
sequently i.s not the same person who
learned Dr. Quimby's ideas and methods
in 1862. Hut in a letter addressed to the
Boston Post, dated "No. f,iiO Columbus
avenue. March 7. Â£883," Mrs. Eddy says:
"In IW2 my name was Patterson, my
husband, Dr. Patterson, a distinguished
dentist. After our marriage I was con

Dr. Qilimby's Powers.
There is not In these letters the least
attempt to discredit Dr. Quimby's power
as a mental healer, not the slightest men
tion of magnetism or electricity, and no
suspicion that his treatment was not of a
high spiritual character. On the contrary,
a longing is expressed to attain as high a
level, and there is every reason to believe
that the temptation to claim the great
new truths as her own came later, when
the field wns free. It is noticeable, how
evi r, that the- temperament is one of ex

it is evident that here is the origin of

f have shown these letters to trust
worthy people, who certify that they are
in Mrs. Eddys handwriting, and express
surprise that one who formerly held Dr.
Quimby in sucb high esteem should tram
pi, upon his reputation, claiming his hard
won laurels as her own, borrowing his
ideas, adopting his method of treatment
and even stating in print that his writings
may have been "stolen" from her pub
lished v/orks!
It is easy, however, to understand the
persistence of the false claims of Mrs
Eddy. Her followers really believe that
the truths of mental healing came to Mrs
Eddy by revelation, that Dr. Quimby was
a mere mesmerist whom Mrs. Eddy in-
CLAIMS TO CAST OUT DEVILS.
Story of a Mao Who Has Been in the Practice for Thirty Years.
READING, Pa., April 22,-Thousands
of people in East Pennsylvania are
familiar with the witch doctor of
Reading. No matter where he
goes, by day or by night, in car
riage or on foot.people look after him and
wonder who is his latest patient. Plain
as a farmer, methodical, reserved, yet
determined, and gifted with hard common
sense, the witch doctor goes about his
business, and in all the thirty years of
his practice he has never been accused of
wrongdoing. His business thrives.
"They only send for me," said the doctor
"when the usual medical treatment fails.
Then they come for miles, from all direc
tions, principally from the country dis
tricts. You may be sure that when I do
come to a house the case [ find requires
strong measures, if the sufferer is a man
or woman, boy or girl, it requires heroic
attention. If the ordinary medical aid has
failed, and the verdict of the neighbors
is that the patient is suffering from
witches, nothing short of something
miraculous is going to satisfy them. I
never tell a patient right out what I think
of the case. Sometimes I find a young
woman upstairs in a dark room shrieking
that seven devils are after her. She is
in a terribly nervous state, pacing up and
down the floor, while her parents are in
terror below. They have read their Old
and New Testaments faithfully, and they
Implore me to use my power to cast out
devils or any other familiar spirits that
may possess the sufferer. I at once put
myself In full communion with these
people. As they believe, so I believe. I
hear their story. Every symptom is re
lated to me. For weeks the patient has
been acting like one possessed; no
sleep, no appetite, frightful imaginations,
spasms, wasting away, shrieks, hysteria,
epilepsy, lunacy, whatever it may be.
They say she is bewitched.
"I agree with them. I go up to the
young woman, sit down with her, order
the light of day turned in to the room,
take her by the hands, tell her to be
calm, command her (Irmly yet grently to
be quiet. I say I have come to cure her;
structed, and that the whole subject of
her Indebtedness to him was settled in
court. Consequently, these mlsstatements
have been passe! from mouth to mouth,
until nowadays they are repeated in pub
lic addresses by innocent people who
would be dumfounded to know that they
are false. Yet I can name trustworthy
people who could give much more dam
aging testimony than the above. The
evidence is firsthand, and has been care
fully investigated by competent scientific
authorities. But I have tried to say the
best word possible for Mrs. Eddyâname
ly, that she was once loyal to Dr. Quim
by and valued the great truths which he
discovered. I must at the same time
state, however, that never has man or
woman been so idealized, never have a
religious leader's followers been so de
ceived. I have been familiar with the his
tory of the mental healing movement
from my boyhood, and have known of
one right hand manor woman after an
other who became undeceived and separ
ated from Mrs. Eddy, and if half were
told that could be told the exposure would
produce an unparalleled sensation.
Why Withheld So Long.
Mr. Dresser acknowledges the pertin
ency of these questions. Why have these
facts been so long withheld? Why have
not these former favorites exposed Mrs.
Eddy? Because one and a'l feared her,
were afraid of her "malicious" treatment.
Two editors of mental healing publica
tions have had the courage to publish
historical statements concerning Mrs.
Eddy. But both wrote to Mr. Dresser
that their business was threatened with
ruin if they dared to publish anything
more about her. "I was informed by one
publisher that his receipts fell off' one
half from the time he printed certain let-
ters of mine concerning Dr. Quimby.
What, then, could one do when those who
needed to be undeceived wore expressly
forbidden to read one's articles, when one
must contend with a powerful ecclesiasti
cal and financial organization? One could
only await the time when all things
should tend toward the overthrow of this
gigantic delusion. The time has come.
Within a few months those who know
I am the witch doctor. I. tell her that I
already know the evil spirit or demon
that possesses her and that I can certain
ly drive it from her. If she is strong
enough I take her downstairs and out Into
the open air. To pacify her I may utter
some strange sounds or words as I go;
make some odd movements; turn a chair
back to the door; lay sticks of wood In
her path; do any odd ihing that she sees,
while I say that for the devil, that for the
witch, that for the evil spirit; anything
that will strike the patient as a remark
able act or declarationâ something that
she his never before sven or heard.
"I relieve in animal magnetism. You
see, I am physically sirong. I believe in
mental control to a certain extent. I find
that the unusual, extraordinary, mysteri
ous or heathenish as you may put it, has
a wonderful effect on such a sufferer.
She watches me closely; listens attentive
ly. T want her to do this. 1 want to dis
tract her. It is wonderful how the patient
calms down. 1 appear terribly in earnest
to defeat the witch, and in this way T
have gained the name of witch doctor.
Then when T have the patient quieted I
proceed to give her medicine to quiet her
nerves; I induce her to eat; I go through
various incantations at the door and win
dows of her room, vowing that every evil
influence will forever be barred out, and
try with my own strong will to impress
It upon the sufferer that she is to be free
from the witch and then I leave her.
"In a majority of cases such afflicted
women are restored to health by proper
medical assistance and nursing. You
know that in this age, while it is very
much improved over the century just
passed,, there are yet many in the back
woods districts who .-itill believe in being
afflicted by spells from witches. Under
stand me, I do not say they are wrong.
I have seen many strange cases and I
cannot say that they vrere the result of an
overwrought imagination. I only know
that they acted as If they imagined they
were verging on insanity. Indeed, some
have told me they thought so. Their
nerves were completely upset. Yet all
they needed was some strong force of

and those Intending to prepare exposes.
The disruption must follow, and conse
quent upon It will come a great reaction
in favor of the rational philosophy found
ed by Dr. Quimby."
Hiss Woodbury's Charges.
So mucn for Mr. Dresser. Now for Miss
Woodbury. She begins with a quotation
from Revelations. x:l-3, xli:}-8, "And I
saw another mighty angel come down
from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and
he had in his hand a little hook, open:
and he set his right foot upon the sea,
and his left foot on the earth, and cried
with a loud voice, as when a lion rOareth.
* â¢ * And there appeared a great
wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with
tho sun, and the moon under her feet,
and upon her head a crown of twelve
stars; and she. being with child, cried,
travailing in birth and pained to he de
livered. And there appeared another
wonder in heaven; and behold a great
red dragon, having seven heads and ten
horns, and seven crowns upon his heads;
and his tail drew the third part of the
stars of heaven, and did cast them to
the earth, and the dragon stood before
the woman which was ready to be de-
livered, for to devour her child as soon
as it was bnrn. And she brought forth a
man child, who was to rule all nations
with a rod of iron; and her child was
caught up unto God, and to his throne
and the woman fled into the wilderness,
where she hath a place prepared of God
that they should feed her there a thou
sand, two hundred and tnree score days."
The followers of Mrs. Eddy assert that
mind and body to combat them and put
them at their ease by assuring them that
they would be certainly relieved from the
powers of the witches or the devils in
them.
"Men are not so often attacked. Young
girls and young women are mostly af
flicted. Sometimes I am called to see
boys, and at other times babies in the
cradle, who are apparently starving amid
plenty, but who have Bhrunk to living
skeletons. The parents of such babies in
variably tell me an old woman witch is
under suspicion. I at once enter into
their belief and proceed with a number
of incantations, hut leave medicines for
the ailment I think the child is afflicted
with, and then go away saying that I
had baffled the witch and giving special
Instructions about the first oM woman
who crosses their threshold. Mind you, i
do not say that a spell cannot he put on
a child or any one else. It is safer to tell
you that all surh cases arc overwrought
nervousness. But people have been pos
sessed with devils in all ages. The Lord
cast out devils. Familiar spirits are
chronicled in all histories. The American
Indians had their medicine men who witli
incantations cast out devils, or evil
spirits. We are no better than the peo
ple of a century or ten centuries ago.
We are weaker and wiser, hut we may
be just as full of evil, and just as much
subject to devils as the people of the past
were. I don't say we are. but the sutono
sitlon is that we are, because we are
weaker and wiser.
"We have keener imaginattons, have
more business, more mental activity and
our nerves are more played upon 'Now
couple a mental or a nervous u.sorder or
disarrangement of any bodily function
with an Imagination of devils, witches or
devils, and what is the result? It must
not be said that a man who pretends to
cast out witches is a believer in witch
craft. The patients generally are the be
lU-vers. and they want human sympathy
first, and then, having faith, they can be
aided, possibly, better than in ahv other
way. But, mind you, I don't say tnov are
wrong. I don't say that the casting ,>{u
of devils in the New Testament is false
doctrine or pernicious teaching The
greatest scholars of past history believed
in demonology."
these apocalyptic passages refer to Mrs.
Mary Mason Baker Glover Patterson
Eddy, who was born in the neighborhood
of Concord, N. H., nearly four score
years ago. In other words, these devo
tees maintain that Mrs. Eddy is "the
feminine principle of the Messianic ex
pectation" in the nineteenth century;
that the man child born to the apoca
lyptic woman is Christian Science, while
the angelic little book preee.eding this
birth is Mrs. Eddy's "Science and
Health, With Key to the Scriptures."
An astute critic declares "a woman
clothed with the sun" the most stupend
ous metaphor in any language. Is Mrs.
Eddy that woman? asks Miss Woodbury.
Is the moon under her feet, and are the
twelVe stars on her head. Is she an
tagonized by a great dragon ready to
destroy her revelation? Is her Christian
Science "to rule all nations with a rod of
iron?" Has this child been caught up
into heaven? Was Portland. Lynn or
Boston the wilderness to which this
woman was to flop after her travail; or
Is her desert to be looked for in her
"Pleasant View" estate at Concord, N.
11., whither the prophetess of Christian
Science retreated some years ago?
Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, from whom
Mra. Eddy learned all she knows of the
theory and practice of metaphysical heal
ing, was born in Lebanon, N. H., Febru
ary 16, 1802, but spent the larger part of
his life in Belfast, Me., where he was well
known, both for his successful healing
and for his personal goodness. H*Â» inter
est in the power of mind began In 1838,
and his early methods involved mesmer
ism, clairvoyance and scriptural laying on
of hands; but a few years later he gave
up the practice of mesmerism and began
to heal diseases by the silent mental
method, declaring "Truth" to be the great
healer; yet not deriving his theory or
practice from the Bible, though rejoicing
In scriptural indorsement. In 1559 Dr.
Quimby removed to Portland. In a cir
cular to the sick, which he distributed
while in Portland, he says:
"My practice is unlike all medical prac
tice. I give no medicines and make no
outward applications, but simply sit by
the patient, tell him what he thinks is his
disease, and my explanation is the cure.
â¦ â¢ â¢ If I succeed in correcting his er
rors I change the fluids of his system and
establish the truth or health. The truth
la the cure. This mode of treatment ap
plies to all cases." /
In October, 1862, when Dr. Quimby had
been four years in Portland, working
what were called miracles of bodily heal
ing, there was, one day. assisted up his
stairs a woman who declared herself suf
fering with spinal disease. The new pa
tient was poor: but through the doctor's
aid she found a boarding place near by.
Concerning this period we have ample
testimony from those who daily saw Mrs.
Kddy (then Mrs. Patterson), to the effect
that, though claiming to be so well at the

treatment. Mrs. Patterson still went regu
larly to Dr. Quimby's office to ask him
questions concerning his methods. When
in her own room she was busily engaged
in putting on paper the points she drew
from him. and these papers were after

misinterpreted his ideas.
Amerigo Vespucci Patterson.
Where did Mrs. Patterson discover
Christian Science? asks Miss Woodhury,
and she answers her own question thus:
In her own body. How? By the action
upon her own mind, of Dr. Quimby'B
mental method?, which she now declares
to have been not mental. Dr. Quimby
wrote out in full his opinions and con
clusions on the subject of disease, and
not with the help of Mrs. Patterson, but
with that of trusted friends and patients
in Portland, sonv* of whom are still liv
ing to tell the facts and have their cop
ies of Dr. Quimby'a writings among
their most precious possessions.
The following headlines of an article
dated 1X63 show conclusively the senti
ments of Dr. Quimby at that time:
"My Conversion From Disease to
Health, and the Subsequent change
From Belief in the Medical Faculty to
Entire Disbelief in It. and to the
Knowledge of the Truth on Which I Base
My Theory."
"My theory teaches man to manufac
ture health, and when people go into this
occupation disease will diminish, and
those who furnish disease and death will
be few and scarce. "
When Dr. Quimby was in his grave
and Julius Dresser did not succeed him'
as Mrs. Eddy had anticipated, her first

step was tn practice mental healing, in
a tentative fashion, which, at the end of
nine years, all being quiet on the fn
tomac, led to her publication, In ilsra, 01
her first edition of "Science and Health
though si:,, bad copyrighted It (as she
states in her preface to the edition or
in,m;j tivÂ«. years before.
In 1881 Mrs. Eddy moved from Lynn to
Boston, living first at 569 and afterward
at 571 Columbus avenue, until, in TO,
she purchased a house in the fashionable
Back Bay district, 355 Commonwealth
avenue, near the Leif Ericsson statue.
Organizes the Mother Church.
As soon as she was 'veil settled in thÂ»
city she organized a Christian Science
church, at first holding services in Haw
thorn Hall, on Park street, overlooking
the commonâ "the Church of the Holy
Elevator," as a newspaper critic pro
fanely termed it: and later in Chlicker
ing Hall, 133 Tremont street. About the
same time she established her Metaphy
sical College and her students' associa
tions, enlarged Science and Health, pub
lished several Bmaller books and set In
motion the Christian Science Journal.
In 1882 her fourth husband, Dr. Eddy,
died. The physician who i -'inducted tue
autopsy says tliut the death was the
result of distinctly developed heart dis
ease, but Mrs. Eddy declared that it was
the efffi'v of arsenical poisoning, mental
ly administered. At this time Mrs.
even urged Miss Wopdbury to represent
to Wendell Phillips, an old family friend,
that Dr. Eddy had !><â < n mentally killed
by former students, now antagonistic
rivals, whom he had not seen for months
and years.
Ordained by Her Own Students.
She soon had herself privately ord
to the ministry by her own students.
"W'hfn she preached the hall was crowd
ed, a:>.d contribution box* - w< re much b'-t
--ter filled than usual, though this did not
often happen, for gent-rally Mrs. Eddy
preached only three or four times a year,
and even then her sermons were as like
each other as dried peas, though the ad
miring Dorcases, Priscillas. Bapphlras,
Johns, J'eier?, Melchisedeks and Keturahs
whispered their rapt adoration to each
other, "Wasn't she splendid to-day?"
ecstatically unconscious that they had
heard substantially the same address six
weeks before.
When others preached she occasionally
attended the church whereof she was
nominally a pastor, and took some part in
the service. Once she held a bapi
service without water, though her mem
ory failed her in repeating the formula
prepared Jby herself, and sometimes there
was a communion service without wafer
or wine. Most Sundays, however
worshiped God in the privacy of her own
riome. If wonder was expressed I I
absence the adoring disdpl< a replied,
"How could she. the divinely inspired,
bear to hear ordinary preaching?"
Her invisibility increased her repute,
and whoever the speaker, the congrega
tion joined in her extraordinary version of
the Lord's Prayer, replete with turgid
polysyllables from the Latin and a be
wildering admixture of pronouns and con
fusion of tenses. If she could not be
present her brief telegram was re< â¢
with adulation by hundreds who had
never met her. Soon she forbade students
calling their Christian Science teach' rs
by. the name of "Mother," as had been
their wont. Herself she styled "Mother
Mary." and the behavior of the raptured
throngs rivaled the- enthusiasm of the
populace over a returned hero.
Illegal Degrees.
Miss TVoodbury alleges that in IRS9 Mrs.
Eddy ostensibly gave up her college and
retired to Concord, X. H., at the very pe
riod when a Massachusetts District At
torney was looking for evidence of that
institution's illegally conferred degrees, of
which there were thousands, punishable
with a fine of $500 for each offense. "is
this the reason." she asks, "that for ten
years Mrs. Eddy has not visited Boston on
a week day, when she would be subject to
arrest?"
From Concord she issues her edicts
and manifestoes. Multitudes go thither
to worship at her shrine and are satis
fied if they do not even touch the hem of
her garment but only see her from afar,
as a beatific vision, while she speaks
few commonplace words or repeats the
Ninety-first P?alm ere she turns her back
on her visitors. She is accompanied by
her liveried secretary on her daily drive
in a close carriage, keeping off every
draught that might cause her to catch
a New England cold.
The mother church grew valiant, de
spite one or two dissolutions, til! i
the granite building on Falmouth street
was erected at a cost of some %2i>i>
"mother's room" was elegantly fitted up
here for Mrs. Eddy's special occupancy,
though it is 'not always open to ordinary
mortal eye?. Occasionally the :
emeritus comes from her "rural retreat
when she emerges from her sanctuary,
to bless the gazing adorers,
and only resume their seats when she
is enthroned in the pulpit.
Again they remain standing after the
benediction, till she re-enters her holy of
holies, where she may hold sacred
munion with the lifelike picture of the
old chair in which she claims to have
r.een sitting when writing her ii -
volume, until time for me carriage to
take her to a special train.
With the opening of the new church
came a new commandment, that here
after the Bible and "Science and
Health' should be its only pastors, no
original discourses being allowed, only
readings, by a man and woman alter
ternately. of presumably corresponding
paseages from the two sacred volumes.
"Malicious Animal Magnetism."
â¢ ."No sect prospers without a devil,"
says Miss Woodbury, sagely, "the ra
tional religion being ever for the hope
less minority. Dr. Quimby knew no
devil, since to him all things were divine
ly planned and planted. Christian Sci
ence started without a devil, but Mrs.
Eddy could not control the multitude,
and so fashioned a Hsto in a new
dress and christened him 'Malicious An
imal Magnetism.' "
This "Mother Church" of Boston has
a roll of 12,000 members from all over the
country, but its affairs are lodged in the
hands of the forty "first members," and
its control is practically lodged in a star
chamber sanhedrim of seven, unless its
manual has been recently changed, as oft
happens.
How is the Christian Science organiza
tion maintained? asks Miss Woodbury.
Partly, she replies, through the convic
tion that deeds are right because the
leader does them, rather than that she
acts thus and so because it is right; that
ideas are true because she utters them,
not that she utters them, as Jesus did
because they are true. Buff and blue reb
els are denounced as enemies to God
that is. to his chosen "Wonder in Heav
en," and untoward events are attributed
to the hypnotic malice of somebody who
has : had wit and courage to leave the
ranks.
Said one of Mrs. Eddy's pastoral col
leagues: "If I saw Mrs. Eddy doing some
thing I thought wrong I should know it
was my blunder, not her error for she
can do no wrong." In short. Miss Wood
bury declares that Mary Eddy has no use
for people who think. "Each grim sug
gestion in her interest must infect her
crowd of believers, among whom it
spreads like wildfire. Those who differ
from their teacher, through greater light
as to her motives and history, are pro

The Famous Police Raid on the Highbinder Dens,
HE late Fresno battle among Chi
' I k ncs'e highbinders, in which three
* were killed: is not the biggest bat
l that over took place between
ilggesi bat
tween
j the rival societies, by any means.
I The first really successful fight
* ever put up by any tong 01 high
binder society was the most dis
astrous of all. It was consummated in
the old Cliinese Theater on Jackson street
in the early seventies. I saw the result,
which can never be erased from my mem
ory. The diabolical scheme was evolved
in the l". - aln of the old rascal who was
The rhief adviser of the Ok Gong Tong, a
society very popular at that time. His
plot to raise money .â  as as follows;
Certain members of the tong were to
enter the playhouse on .a certain night
when another rival society was to have a
festival. These picked men were to take
s^ais in the gallery and when the house
became well filled they were ordered to
throw some lighted papers saturated with
oil down upon the heads of the audience
pcatfd below in the main portion of the
auditorium. Immediately this was done
the others were to give an alarm of tire.
U<Â» explained that the result would be a
stampede and a general rush for the
front door. The hatchet men were to he
stationed near that exit and carefully
watch for the men with whom the tong
had to deal. Incidentally, those who were
capable of good light-fingered â .â ...â¢ were
to pick the pockets of the frightened peo
ple who were trying to escape the flames.
The scheme, worked beyond expectation.
As soon as the turning paper was thrown
from the gallery there was a wild rush for
th- front door, the only exit from the
building. Leading from the theater proper
was a long and somewhat narrow
hallway fully forty feet in length and
at the auditorium end of this passage
were, a pair of heavy wooden swinging
doors. After the first few people who
were seaied or standing near the doors
had made their escape! the springs with
which the big doors were kept closed re
coiled and they Hew back into the faces
of the n^xt portion of the surging mob.
With a fury born of desperation they
f.<roed the. doors from their hinges, threw
thf-m into the hallway, felling to the floor
thos=e who had escaped ahead of them.
The result was a bridge over which the
rÂ«--Pt rushed, trampling the very lives out
of the unfortunate creatures who were In
th<=- narrow death-trap ahead of them.
There was no public Morgue in those
days, and it was the custom to farm out
the privilege of caring for the dead to
some â¢prising undertaker. When that
official arrived at the scene of the disas
ter he found thirteen cold, repulsive bod
ies laid out on the sidewalk, and all had
been robbed of their valuables.
The job had been done in a most care
ful and workmanlike mariner and the
Ok Gong Tong was avenged. When the
history of the highbinders in this city is
put into types it will record a sanguinary
tale that might well rank with any of the
grÂ»wsome stories of Edgar Allan Poe. or
other clever writers of fiction* who have
depended upon imagination for their ma
terial. The heroic stand made by I.â¢ â¢â 
Bar How in Cum Cook alley when he was
pursued by his many - from one
of the buildings facing on that narrow
thoroughfare is worthy of mention.
Bow was one of the boldest of fighters
ever known in the Chinese quarter. He
declared to his dying day that he had
never taken a human life unless he was
convinced that the act was necessary to
pave, his own.
On this particular occasion How had
been wanted for some months by mem
bers of a rival tong. He had been in hid
ing in one of the flash houses in the alley
for several days, protected by the woman
who remained true to him until the end
earn". A careful watch was kept on the.
house day and night by his enemies.
Finally, through lack oi provisions. Bow
was obliged to make a trip to the shops
to replenish the larder. He had scarcely
reached the second dark landing of the
crooked stairway leading from his quar
ters on the top floor, when the sharp
crack of a revolver and the whiz of a bul
let told him that he was discovered.
Bow flÂ»;w to the street, for experience
had taught him that it was useless to
fight highbinders in the dark. On his way
to the street he loosened his six-Fho.M.-r
from Its fastenings under his jacket and
prepared to st.ll his life as dearly as pos
sible.
No sooner had he stopped into the open
than batteries were opened on him
from all shies. Never difl man make a
bolder stand. With hip Blx-shootei
ing across hi? arm that he might get a
more steady aim this heathen stood as
firm as a rook and never turned a hair.
His (Minnies were steadily peppering him
from all points of the compass, but he re
mained as calm as if he were taking a
â  observation of the sky in search of
Indication of a change in the
weather. He turned deliberately from
right to left while his six-shooter kept
spitting away. The police soon took a
hand in the game, but not until Bow had
been pretty well perforated with shots
from the enemy's puns.
How was taken to a surgpon. who saved
his life, which was finally forfeited to the
State. He was hanged for the murder of
a fi How-countryman.
To this day one may find grayhoards
around police quarters who believe that
1... s. â¢: Bow was convicted through the
perjured testimony of rival highbinders,
who took this means of getting him out
of the way.
All who knew him could not help ad
miring the man's supreme courage, His
last wo;-. is to the e\< cutloner were:
"Thank you for your kindness, captain.
Good-by! Tell all China boys to he hon
est and desert the tongs. I know. 1 have
tried both ways, and I say this that all my
trymen may hear and heed. It pays
better to he honest."
These highbinder societies, as we know
them, date from the time of the Tai
J'ing war in China. They are the off
spring of the famous Triad society, mean
â  !<â¢â  society of the three united-
Heaven, Earth and Man. which according
to Chinese philosophy imply the three de
partments of nature. The Triad society.
It is said, was formed for the patriotic ob
of expelling the Manchus and re
storing the native or Ming dynasty. Tt
is known In s.inie parts of China as the
Kongsi, In this city as the Ge Hin- liter

is known from the Straits Settlements

organization appear to have
allied to something like Free Ma
sonry, and to have aimed simply at mu
tual aid anil protection; bui as the num
ber Inert a I views degenerated
from the laudable ends of reciprocal ben

hand, the Sam Vups represent the better
'lass and by far the more wealthy, and
I should say have more sympathy from
the ["â lice than do the See Yups for many

Yups so far outnumber

blackguards of the two. and in consc

Interests to protect, and if such a thins
is possible are more inclined to expose
the criminals who may be members of
societies, or tongs, as they are
commonly culled. Be this as it may. this
war of thp Chinese Roses, as it were, has
resulted in the building up of a profes
sion which the descendants of the old
pirates of the Pearl River take kindly to.

the fact that if murder he necessary to
enforce or emphasize his demands It i 3
an easy matter' to hire certain members
of his own Rarnr of cutthroats to perform
the deed for a comparatively reasonable
sum.
The following list of questions and an
swers t have copied verbatim:
Any person wishing to" join this society must
listen to th" instructions of the headmen, who
teach him. alio\e ali. obedience to parents.
All must obey the company's law and the
orders of the headmen. If a brother through
disobedience or inattention to the orders of the
headmen get" into trouble, ho must manage
for himself, a? the society will have nothing to
do with It.
Any member being about to marry, if he ap
ply to thÂ»" society headmen they will present
him with $4.
Any member dying and leaving a wife or
children here without mean? of subsistence,
if they come and acquaint the headmen they
will receive $1 and fifty catties of rice.
If a woman belonging to a member of the
society run away with another man. he must
>ail together the brethren to come
forward nnd break the laws of the Government
by fighting; it is his own business and he must
manage it: the headmen will not interfere. If
his lawful wife run away with another man he
should acquaint the headmen, and if he has no
money !â > iak>> proceedings in court they will
provide him with a sufficient sum to pa:
and so let the Government punish the offender.
A member must, above all things, honor and
obey his parents; if any brother abuse or curse
his parents, on the headmen being acquainted
with it they will dismiss him from the so
ciety.
Any member (whether headmen or merely
common member) running away with a broth
er's lawful wife or concubine will be dismissed
from the society by the headmen on acquaint
ance with the fact.
[f any member go abroad and quarrel, or
commit murder, or even shod blood, the head
men will not interfere; he must go before the
police and be punished.
It is not permitted for a member to
rtuce Into the society any person employed by
the Government; any memt>er breaking
rule will be dismissed from the society and
severely punished as the headmen may dll
Any member of the society wishing to borrow
money must conform to the rules of tiie so
ciety as to interest, period, etc-. ; lie mast 1 1* >t
charge nor ask more than the rate fixed by
the headmen.
Any member who shall shelter or hide the
runaway wife of a brother member will be
dismissed from the society and punished as the
headmen may direct.
Any member who may be arrested fur quar
reling, gambling or any other minor offense
against the laws of the Government under
which he may be residing should apply to the
headmen for bail. If he is tried and sentenced
he must pay his fine or suffer imprisonment,
as the headmen will have nothing further to
do wtth the case.
Any member guilty of striking, cursing or
abusing his father or mother must be brought
before the headmen, who will reprove him and
fix punishment as they may think proper.
All these rules the candidate makes sol
emn promise to obey, and in order to mure
securely bind him to his word he is
obliped to take oath to the following in
junction:
"1 swear to obey my parents. I swear to
obey al! the instructions of the headmen of the
society, and should I forget my vows may I
within one hundred days die by >elng cut to
pieces, or in the five seas, my flesh floating on
the surface, and my bones sinking to the bot
tom.
"I swear after entering the. tong gale to be
comes one of the tong family, and should I see
a brother of the tong family fighting with my
twin brother who is not a tone brother to do
all in my power to separate them, hut to use
no violence against my tong brother. If I
break this oath may my intestines fall out or
may thunder strike me or fire burn me to
death.
"I also swear that were I to see one of my
tong brothers in the custody of the police or
other Government officers to do all in my power
to rescue him (without breaking the laws of
the country?). Should I disregard this rule
and pass the matter over as of. no consequence
may within one hundred days thunder strike
me down dead in the road and may my bones
perish in the rivers and seas.
"After entering the tong gate I promise not
to attempt to raise myself to the position of'
(Heong Choo) incense burner until I have
obeyed the laws of the tone as handed down
to us and given five years of faithful servlc*.
Should 1 forget this oath 1 expect my brothers
to punish me with at least 108 blows, and if I
twice forget my solemn promise may they cut
off both my ears.
"After entering the tons gate I promise not
to interfere with the Heong Choo at the times
of ceremonies or theatrical performances, and
if I ever attempt to arrest or cause the arrest
of the Heong Choo may a tiger tear me to
pieces, may thunder strike me, may fire burn
me and . may the blood flow from my eyes,
ears, mouth and nostrils.
"I promise if a brother of the tons, through
crime or misfortune, fly to my house for as
sistance, I will do my best to conduct him
in safety over the boundaries that he may
escape. If I ever forget to do this ma^y I
die by the sword within one hundred days and
my body be forgotten.
"I swear never to divulge to my son or any
member of my home family the secrets of
the tong. Nor will I ever dispose of the jacket
which I now wear during the ceremony of my
initiation into this society, as the garments
I now wear I must ever hold sacred. Should
I forget these instructions may I die by the
mouth of tiger or wolf. -â :. ' â ." .
"If I meet a person who has at any time
informed against a tone brother I shall im
mediately consider it my duty to hand him
over to our council that the headmen may
deal with him as they may think just and
proper; he must not escape. Should I allow
him to escape may I hang myself and may
pigs drag and may dogs bite my corpse until
it fall to pieces.
"If, after entering the tong gate, I of the
torn? family, having taken the oath (must
know) that the spirits are regarding, and that
our five ancestors knew -when they first es
tablished this golden brotherhood and arranged
these oaths which have been handed down to
us till now that all the brothers would fulfill
them. I must not disregard the oaths which
I have taken. If 1. with a false heart, take
the vows and am afterward insincere and dis
honorable, may I die by 1000 knives and 10,000
â¢spears, ar. i may an arrow secretly strike me.
"If With good heart 1 obey and walk accord
ing to the oaths, then will I have 10,000 happi
nesses and felicities." â '..'.*â¢'â¢
So much for the oaths and rules of the
highbinders. The careful reader will
readily observe that the oaths are dia
metrically opposed to the first set of rules,
all of which means that the rules are
printedâ or writtenâ might possibly
fall into the hands of one not a member
of the tong. But the oaths are delivered,
as the Chinese express it. from mouth to
ear, giving one a fair idea of what the
real objects of the society amount to.
A very well Informed Chinese said:
"You can hardly blame th^se poor crea
tures for banding together for mutual
protection. They have been squeezed for
a great many centuries by their own
Government, and they naturally protest."
There are at leas! twenty-one well-estab
lished tonga or highbinder societies. How
they all manage to exist is a mystery to
the white man. \V. C. BUNNER.
Points of a Good Cat.
A Â£<"'<> cat â me Mini you want 10 nave

By all means to be avoided is a cat with
thin, sharp nose and twitching ears. It
must be remembered also that a good

The greatest mistakeâ probably the
most common oneâ in the care of domestic
cats is overfeeding, particularly too much
meat. In the wild life a cat has exercise
which enables her to digest food. In the
lazy house life the same full feeding leads
to stomach troubles and to "fits."â

THE LYNCHING PROBLEM IN THE SOUTH.
LADY FRANIS BROOME
ONE of the most dramatic scenes
ever enacted In the city of Santa
Barbara occurred a few days ago.
when Lady Frances Broome re
sisted city ot^cials under orders to
remove part of her property.
Of course there are. two sides to every
Ptory. and In this case it is likely that
the I-Vdoral Court will finally be called
upon to determine the case.
Lady Broome came to Santa Barbara
about fifteen years ago In search of
health, and upon finding that the climate
benefited her she decided to remain per
rnancntl>. She built a beautiful residence
on the corner >â ' Micheltorena and Cas
tillo streets, and at this time portions of
Micheltorena street were graded and the
general lines of the. street established. The
property known as Baxter Terrace, on the
Bath-street corner, and the Brooms block,
between Castillo and Rancheria streets,
extended some twelve feet beyond the
limit, although in the survey.
Mrs. Broome's place was surrounded by
a beautiful hedge of cypress, and in order
to ide the street to conform with the
lines of the survey twelve feet of Lady
Broome' 8 garden hedge would have to be
removed.
In March. 1898, the City Council ordered
the Marshal to notify Lady Broome and
Mrs. Baxter to correct their lines so they
would conform to those of the street.
Lady Broome refused to comply, holding
that her line was the correct one under
the old Norway survey, made some time
ago. She threatened, if she was dis
turbed, to bring the matter to the United
States courts, which right she had as a
British subject. j-r .'
The matter waa dropped for some time,
until at a recent Council meeting the
Councilmen ordered the Marshal to have
the obstruction removed, as it was the
intention of. the city to soon grade the
street.
The Marshal notified Lady Broome that
the work of removal of the hedge would
commence the following morning.
Lady Brooroe replied that she would re
sist and threatened the use Of dynamite
in case anything was done to her hedge.
At the usual hour of commencing work
the Marshal, with hia force, appeared on
the scene. The gardener. Valenzuela, was
prepared for the onslaught. 'He waa
armed with a largesix-ahooter strapped to
his waist. In full view he stood at the
entrance of the grounds. He ordered the
officers off the place. The Marshal an
swered that the land in dispute was part
of a public street and the public bad. a
perfect rig thereop.

GOVERNOR MOUNT of Indiana proposes, as a solution of the
lynching problem, the enactment of a law making the county
responsible for such conditions and liable in a civil suit for
damages, the neart^st of kin of the victim being authorized
to institute the suit. The following is Governor Mount's pro
posed solution of the lynching problem:
The good name of Indiana has been dishonored by a lawless mob
that took from the jail in Ripley County and lynched five men charged
<s> â â â  â <8> with burglary. Even if these men had
GOVERNOR MOUNT, been by a court found guilty, as charged,
. .. their punishment would have been lm
lndiana - prisonment and not death. All sense of
<?â¢ â¦ justice and safety revolts against the
mob as a tribunal for pronouncing judgment or administering punish
ment. Governor Atkinson of Georgia, in his message to the Legis
lature, presents at length the dangerous tendency of mob violence.
In the course of his argument he says:
"The mob Judges without a full and complete hearing from both
sides. Its members are not the most capable of Judging. It decides
in passion, and too often in whisky. How can It fail to make mis
takes and sacrifice the lives of the innocent? I feel," he says, "the
more deeply upon this question because, from the best information I
can secure, I believe that during my administration there have been
in this State several men lynched who were not guilty of the crimes
with which they were charged. How many can never be known, for
their tongues are hushed and they are denied an opportunity to prove
their innocence. I am informed that one man whom the mob believed
to be guilty was shot down. A question then arose as to his identity,
and he was salted down like a hog and shipped to the location of the
crime and found to be the wrong man â an Innocent man."
It cannot be argued that lax enforcement of law justifies a mani
festation of contempt of courts and disregard for the law. Any
county that can organize a sentiment to prevent lynchers from being
punished can also organize against crime and punish criminals in a
court of justice. Where lynch lawlessness obtains there justice is
dethroned and courts are myths. The constitution and laws of the
State would there be trampled under the blood-stained feet of brutal
and lawless men. If mob violence Is to go unpunished then hate and
malice will sit enthroned, and passion, fired by intoxication and gov
erned by a spirit of revpnge, instead of evidence, justice and the law
will render insecure life and property. The anarchist would welcome
such conditions and would then feel licensed to proceed to even up
things according to his dwarfed sense of equity.
t*alenzuela offered no violent opposition
at the time.
Lady Broome. who was absent at the
beginning of the work, soon returned, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 30, 1899.
I believe that there is no law-abiding citizen who will attempt
to defend Lynching:, even in what may seem to be the most extreme
*â¢ <?> rases. I have always taken the position

<* <& forced there i* something radically wrong
with the people. There is no doubt that some cure for the lynch
ing habit is forely needed, but there is a question in my mind as to
the efficacy of Governor Mount's prescription.
The difficulty is that the mohs. Influenced by passion, would not
stop to W( Igh the 'lists to the county that would result from a civil
suit brought by the relatives of the lynched person, nor would H
car* about the cost.
It also occurs to me that the law recommended by Governor
Mount might not have the effect of making the county authorities
more vigilant in guarding prisoners, because lynchings are very often
d Hi' Ujx n "the spur of the moment" and find officers of the law
utterly unprepared to resist or protect.
Somewhat in the same line I would call attention to that portion
of my message to the Legislature of Michigan recommeridins the

payment of costs and damages to persons convicted of crime who are
afterward demonstrated to be innocent, as follows:
"In the main the laws of this State have been passed witn tne
object in view of according: to allâ the lowliest as well as the lÂ»snesi.
the weakest as well as the strongest, the poorest as well as tne
richestâ equal rights and privileges, and subjecting each to the same
punishment, under like circumstances and conditions.
-While it Is the theory of the law that all men stand equally
before it, yet there has been made no provision by means of whicn
justice can be done a man who has been convicted of a crime ana
is afterward shown to be Innocent, or those who are sometimes
wrongfully tried for an offense against the State and their innocence
established. . . '*â  .
"I would recommend the enactment of laws giving those charged
with crime, and whose innocence is established, the same costs against
the respective counties in which they were prosecuted as are given to
a successful party in a civil suit.
"I would also recommend that some prqvision be made for com
pensating those who shall be sentenced to a term of Imprisonment
and whose innocence shall afterward be shown. If they are wrong
fully deprived of their liberty by the fc>tate it is but right that the
Â£tate should compensate them for the time forcibly taken from them.
Such claims might perhaps be heard and allowed by the Board of
State Auditors, Circuit Judges, or a commission created for the
purpose." Â» Â« .
â¦ I do not think that Governor Mount's
GOVERNOR McLAURIN, proposed law will prevent lynching. This
judgment is based on experience in such
Mississippi. matters and my knowledge of laws in

For the laxity in the execution of the laws the lawyers are largely
to blame. Lynchings will continue, no matter what the law may be,
until the public is satisfied that criminals will be properly dealt with
under the law. When legal procedure is made to conform with pub
lic opinion lynchings will cea6e. If you wish to know when this can
be brought about I refer you to the legal profession for an answer.

or men charged with capital crime, and that no man who trusted
him had suffered tin 1 extreme penalty. This is a case in point and
illustrates my position and the njain fact in the matter under dis
cussion.
My own opinion is that legislation, however stringent, will not
do away with the offense if cogent reasons for its occurrence exist.

and punishment for crime were certain under the law lynchings would

and the executive decline to exercise the pardoning power, except in
cases where the innocent have been convicted, it is my opinion that
lynchingi will be of comparatively rare occurrence.
In short, if we should minimize the practice of lynching -we must
execute the law, make punishment certain and quit pardoning
criminals.

Here she was compelled to rt-maln a

"The worst part of the work," said En

of the building of the roadbed, "was in

"We began this about two years ago
and worked for weeks and weeks among
the t'ules. At certain points the growth
was so high that it was impossible to get
a line through the tules without first
cutting them down. In one place we did
this for over two miles, and then found
that the route so laid out was imprac

was made last week by a Sunday Call
representative. Engineer Storey was on
hand and made all explanations.
The beginning of the western end of
the roadbed through the swamp is a few
miles from Breutwood. At this point
there is a slough, across which a bridge
has yet to be built.
The new roadbed is one of the most ex
traordinary sights of its kind in the world.
At present it is merely a big pile of black
earth, with a canal on either side. The
canals were made by the dredgers, that
gouged out the earth and piled it up for
the new roadbrd. Naturally this pro
duced a channel.
"We are going to keep these canals
here," said Engineer Storey, "for two
reasons. One is to prevent the tule fires
that are sure to rage on both sides from
Jumping across and burning out our
track. The other reason is because the
canals are navigable and will make it
easy for us to get in certain kinds of
supplies, such as ti^s. without unloading
them from the schooners till we get them
to their destination."
About four miles from the Rrentwood
end of the roadbed there are two navl

ROLLER BOAT:
Speclal to The Sunday Call.
~w AST year the world was amused,
Lthen perplexed, then astonished at
the effort of Frederick A. Knapp,
a daring Canadian inventor, to
navigate a huge boat which rolled
on the sea like a barrel. The in

Knapp's invention would revolutionize
the science of navigation, and now with
thousands of dollars at his command the
inventor Is letting contracts for the con

It will enter Into active competition with
steam and sail vessels of the present type
for the world's water traffic. The big
cylinder will be finished and launched
this summer.

revolution of all deep water transporta

greater speed than that made by the
crude model which has been operated in
Toronto Bay the crafts now plowing- the
inland seas may read their orders to tie
up in permanent quarters, for the carry
ing capacity of the roller boat Is immense
ly greater on the same draught than that

power required to pro Del it is far less.
To form a correct mental image of the
roller boat, picture a huge barrel or cyl

make the boat unsinkable.
Not only Is this great barrel the shell
of the boat, but it is also its propellerâ
the wheel which gives the craft its ac
tual traveling capacity. Think of a boat

feet in diameter! But the term "paddle
wheel" is not strictly applicable In thlg
t ease, for the roller boat has neither screw.

drawbridges will be put in at these
points and the work will consume nearly
all summer.
Just beyond the river provision has
been made for carrying off the enormous
body of water that would cover the coun
try for miles and miles in time of a flood.
As it happens, the roadbed is built at
right angles across the direction in which
the water flows, and would be likely to
be washed out unless some provision were
made for its escape. /
This is accomplished by building a tres
tle about a mile and a half long. The wa
ter will flow through this without doing
any damage to the roadbed. Careful cal
culations have been made and it is be
lieved that the trestle will allow several
times the amount of water that is likely
to gather in any flood to run off- without
the slightest difficulty.
At a point about six miles from Brent
wood six dredgers are still at work piling
up earth on the roadbed. As the soft
mud from the bottom of the canal is piled
on to the roadbed it slowly settles and
very unevenly. Those parts that sink be

nor paddles. The four-Inch T-rails run
ning from end to end of the outside of the
cylinder are better described as cogs
which get into the water and enable the
roller to roll forward over the sea instead
of merely revolving without progress. The

Within the tunnel or core of this hollow
cylinder is suspended the boat proper or
the portion carrying the passengers, crew,
cargo and engines. The cylinder revolves
around this inner cradle, the latter always
remaining level Only at the points where
the "spider work" of the cylinder projects
down to the "Journals" or huge hollow
steel axles by which the central section of
the boat is suspended does the framework

over several times until tho required
height and strength is obtained.
"These dredgers have been working
steadily twenty-two hours a day for the
past year," said Engineer Storey. "They
lift about four tons of earth each timÂ«
they are filled, and they will carry about
one hundred loads an hour. So you can
figure out what an enormous amount of
soil has to be moved in order to get that
pile of dirt in condition to lay a railroad
track on top of it."
The Stockton end of the swamp road
bed is at a point on Whisky Slough about
four miles from the city. From this point
to Brentwood the road is almost in a
straight line. Standing on the highest
point it is possible to get a view of the
whole length. It can be dimly traced as a
black line through the green tule. lands,
with here and there a dredger at work
showing through the haze.
From the end of the swamp roadbed
into Stockton is about four miles, over
which the grading is nearly all done. At
the San Joaquin River a drawbridge is
being built. This is a stupendous piece of
The suspended interior is divided into
three lengths, two long sections separated
by a short one. The short central section
of the inner cradle contains the engines,
one end section the first class and the
other the second class passengers. The
passage from one to another of these sec
tions is through the hollow "journal,"
which is a part of the non-rotating center
of the boat. As these steel axles, in a
roller boat for ocean service are bored
by tunnels ten feet in diameter, it will
be seen that they are ample for carrying
all the electric lighting cables, telegraph
and telephone wires, heating tubes, etc.,
and for affording a passage way. The
steering Is done by rudder drags at each
end, operated from a bridge suspended
outside the boat.
A knotty problem in the construction of
this boat was the application of the power
by which the outside cylinder is revolved.
This is accomplished by a battery of three
engines, having a long upward stroke, the
pistons being attached to "cranks" of the
big driving shaft. The points on the circie
of the shaft at which the pistons apply
the power are equidistant from each
other, or 120 degrees apart. At each end
of the driving shaft is a powerful cog
wheel, fitting into the cogs of the cylin
der's bearings, or more properly into an
internal "spur gear" rigidly connected
with the solid bulkhead of the cylinder.
Above the suspended cradle of the boat
is an arched ceiling hiding from vfew the
interior of the revolving cylinder over
head. Light and air are freely admitted
at the open ends. Only the ends of the
cradle are, of course, in the least exposed
to sea and weather, and the fact that the
bottom of the suspended section of the
boat is high aboTO the reach of the
fiercest storm waves is calculated to in
spire in the future passengers of this
craft a feeling of complete security. A3

work. The piers are of conrret* set on
piles driven into the river bottom. The
concrete piers are first made in frames
and then sunk by means of screws until
they set on the piles, which have been,
sawed off perfectly even. The drawbridge
is to be of steel. It Is to be of the best
construction, like all the other work on
the Valley road.
"From our depot here in Stockton,"
said Engineer Storey, "to the foot of Mar
ket street, San Francisco, by our road is
only seventy-two miles. Within a year
we will be covering the distance in about
two hours, and I think that from the very
first we will make it inside of three hours.
"From here we run down the river bank,
then cross the swamp to Antioch. From
there we go toward the south and through
a tunnel in the Coast Range, then run
parallel to the Southern Pacific to Point
Richmond. From here our new boat will
cross the bay in thirty-five minutes and
end the journey. If everything goes well
the whistle of our first engine will be
heard at Point Richmond about the Ist
of next November. From then on we ex

to constantly improve it."
that It rolls over tho water "broadside
on," allows little opportunity for end-to
end pitching:.
The problem of the speed which the
roller boat will be able to show Is an In
teresting one, certain to provoke a wide
range of comment from nautical men and
engineers. Regarding this point the In
ventor says:
"If the freight boat which we shall put
into commission next summer for the or->
and grain traffic of the Great Lakes
makes no better speed than did my first
crude working model It will outclass all
competition on the part of the swiftest
freighters now on the inland seas. That
model was 110 feet long and 22 feet in di
ameter. Loaded to 100 tnns displacement
she revolved ten and a half times a min
ute on the application of less than twenty
horsepower of steam. This gave her a
steady speed of six miles an hour. The
roller boat for ocean traffic will be POO
feet long and 200 feet in diameter. On the
basis of what has already been done with
the model in Toronto Bay, operating un
der an insignificant expenditure of power,
I think it may be reasonably granted that
adequate engines will be able to turn 'he
ocean boat thirteen times a minute. That
means a speed of 100 miles an hour!"

and cutthroats known to the history of
America^ It is proposed that tt'i deal

Combination of Governors.
Little over a year ago." as will be re
membered, â¢ three Governorsâ Adams of
Colorado, Wells of Utah and Richards of
Wyomingâ entered into arrangements
whereby the militia of the three States
were to be sent against the robbers.
Plans were made and the. matter was
well under way when the first signs of
hostility between this, country and Spain
were raided. The brave boys were
needed against a greater and more than
local foe and the repression of the out
laws was laid for a time upon the guber
natorial shelf. Perhaps it was well, judg
ing by the' tales of the gang and its
strength which are current.
In fact, it has been decided by the ad
ministration of Utah that the soldiers
are not the agency which can combat and
overcome the McCarthy brigands, or
make the attempt with the best chance
of success. The movement of a body of
troops and a military campaign would be
too much like an open book for tin eyes
of the vigilance of this band which has
long ago taken precautions against just
such a move on the part of outraged
justice.
The people have come to the conclusion
that the only way to deal with the gang
Is through men as wary as they. The
posses to he sent against them will not
besiege the rocks which hold the gang:,
hut they will depend more upon killing
the members one by one as they venture
out for supplies. They will try to invest
the place and starve out the outlaws.
They may be successful, but it will not
be done, according to the judgment of
people who know, in a few days or weeks.
It is generally believed that there win be
bloodshed on both sides before the object

lived to tell about it. From these sources
a faint idea has been gained of the char
acter of the place. Now and then one of
the hand, while visiting a town not many
miles away, has revealed a number of
costumes both light and dazzlingly luxurious. There were among them
many very prim and homely, but how gracious were those that were gra
cious, and how beautiful were those that were beautiful, with that air or
health In their elegance. My companion bowed to this one and bowed to
that one. A childish vanity lit up his face when a ducal coronet decorated
the panel ef a carriage from which a familiar nod and smile greeted him.
However, he related to me the story that he had told me about, and in
which he played a role fully impregnated with the old Yankee Puritan
spirit, and I felt by his tone that this dilettante, somewhat of a snob, was
above all else a scrupulous and tortured Puritan, in whom was always
burning the moral and civil flame of the passengers of the Mayflower.

about what is the little share of each visitor in the maintenance of the

Try it when you go and you will find that your conscience is much easier.
"One evening I was in the Casino to pay this new sort of titheâ that

canyon and loaves it at a particularly
wild and tortuous place for a serpentine
trail running a mile or more up ami down
the heights. Again, at the end of the
trail there is a passageway blasted and

taken by the pang to do the work and
who were blindfolded while approaching
and leaving the place.

is tbt> fact, boasted of by more than one

boast is that it is for another purpose.
Robbers say that wires run from the

SI'KAKiNi; of romantic-historical

has much tn answer for. it was he
more than any other who set flow
ing the ti'i< which has now grown
into such a Rood. His own tirst ventures
in this Held had a quick and a very large
â  -^s. And they well merited it. for
they were wrought out In the most con
scientious, skillful way â written from
abundant inform. i tion and with a liter
ary finish that Mr. Weyman had spent
laborious years in acquiring; but they
suggested to other young writers what
Beemed and what, indeed, has proved,
a very easy method. Scrape together from
old memoirs and histories a good selec
tion of romantic incidents and present
them in ; i and more or less
dramatic order, in a more or less anti
: phraseology, and there you areâ
a recognized, well-paid writer of histori
cal novels.
In Mr. Weyman'a own hands, as I have
indicated, the method was anything but
easy; be from the first strove for some
thing like literary perfection and for a
good while his career was an extraordin
arily tough struggle. Here are some in
teresting literary confession; he made two
or three years ago to his friend, R. H.

From the top of the Eiffel Tower the
exposition looks very unimportant, prob
ably as unimportant as this little ter
restrial globe with its microscopical in
habltanta looks to the man In the moon.
It seems a study only for the entomolo
gist. . Thousands of animated dots, run
ning confusedly in all directions, crawling
up miniature columns, hanging to invis
ible ropes, suggests nothing greater than
so many insects. One feels that a hand
ful of yellow powder could end instan
taneously this Paris exposition, about
his heavy hammer as If he meant to hurl '
it at the audience, shouted back, 'You
ducks, I'll put a tall on some of you!'
"The speech was fatal. The Australian
audiences, having discovered that Sulli
van could not act, would not pay for the
mere pleasure of seeing him on the j
boards. All they wanted was to see him j
fight, and of course we could not have a
| fistic combat every night on the stage.
i If I had been in the pugilistic business I
! might have made barrels of money out
| of Sullivan, but unfortunately I had hold
of the wrong end of the stick.
"Sullivan's appetite, like his strength,
was enormous. On one occasion I was
having supper with a party of ladles in a
; Sydney hotel, when the pugilist forced his
I way into the - im. 'Don't be afraid of
j me, ladies,' he said as he seized a whole
turkey from the table, tore It apart with
j his hands, and commenced crunching the
j bones. Still, Sullivan's appearance was '
I not reassuring, and the ladles all fled.
"Only once did I receive a blow from
! Sullivan, and then, though it was but a
I mere playful tap, I felt the effects for I
weeks. You know Slavin offered to come ,
to Australia expressly to meet Sullivan,
but the fight could not be arranged.
"One day when I was sitting alone with
the fighter he boastfully declared that he
was afraid of no man. I had the impu
dence to retort, 'What about Slavin?'
John L. juet reached out his left, and
without any apparent effort, tapped me on
which all the world is dreaming. On the
i second landing as one descends the ln
sects become well denned midgets, the
j houses respectably sized toys, one even
hears the faint sound of many hammers.
It is only on the first landing from the
ground, however, that one appreciates the
i splender and the magnitude of the enter
j prise. One is high enough to escape all
; obstructions and yet the men are still
! men. One realizes that the scheme is a
i human one and wonders if this gray old
' world has ever looked upon a busier
scene. Near a little bend in the Seine
the towers and the quaint roofs of "Old
j Paris" are already near enough to com
: pletlon to be picturesque and interesting.
! I fancy that no other feature of the ex-
I position will contribute so much to the
general effect. It is a real city that they
are building thorp. When completed It
I will be the history of Paris with all the
| movement and charm of lifo.
The designers have not been too archaeo
logical in their ideas, I am told, but have
chosen to reconstruct the most curious
and the mnÂ«t historically important of the
; old Parisian edifices.
The visitor will enter "Old Paris" by
the Porte Saint Michel, which will bÂ«
gayly decorated with flaps, banners and
escutcheons, the supposed occasion being
the expected entree of a princely party.
I From the galleries erected for the event
: music will sound in honor of the ap
| profirhlnp party, while near the door the
! sheriffs of the city will harangue.
The musicians of "old" Paris will an
nounce every morning that the city is
awake, while at night the chimes will
peal the retreat for visitors. Imposing
sentinels and guards clad in the military
costumes of the times will parade at all
hours to keep In order the students, the
: vagrants and the players or to lead the
guilty ones to the pillory. Near the
Porte Saint Michel one will see the "Mal
son aux Plliers," famous as the house
of the Ilanseatic league and the cradle
of Parisian commerce. Here commences
the street of the old schools, which will
he filled with little shops and merchants
in picturesque costumes. The most at
tractive of all the shops will perhaps be
that of the tapissier Poquelin, where the
corner post is resplendent with carved
monkeys gathering fruits. From this
little shop went forth one day in the
arms of his godmother a tiny son of the
tapissier to be baptized in the neighbor
ing church. This petit Poquelin was af
terward known to the world as Moliere.

MacMahon is a very diminutive, slightly
built man, and Sullivan could have crush
ed him as easily as he would a fly. Mac-
Mahon had a narrow escape, and has rea
son to be thankful that the pugilistic
giant did not hit straight from the shoul
der. "To wind up my experiences with
Sullivan," continued the manager, "I
must tell you his concise comment on the
country. I asked him what he thought
of Australia. He replied, 'I like the place
j and the people well enough, but I don't
i like their dramatic crickets.' "
MacMahon's first dramatic experience
i was gained as manager for Mrs. Scott
Slddons, the famous tiagedienne, whom
| he piloted for several years on an extend
i ed tour through the States.

In this street also is the house that might
be called the cradle of the press of
Prance. It was occupied by Theophraste
Renoudat, doctor and journalist and the
founder of the French Gazette, the first
newspaper in the country. In this quarter
lived all the celehrated printers and en
gravers of the time. During the exposi
tion these industries will be conducted in
the primitive fashion.
In another street bordered on one side
by houses and on the other by shop? will
be the "Urenitr aux poetes," an establish
ment such as Francois Villon might have
conducted, where ballads and choruses,
both joyous and satirical, will be recited,
naturally to the music of the clinking of
glasses. The convent of the Jacobins,
famous during the Revolution, is not far
away. whence will issue religious
processions exactly as in the old^n days.
At the end of this street, by the side of
the cloister, the pillory will be erected.
Here those who wish to contribute to the
Vividness of the scene may deride the poor
individuals who will submit during certain
hours to put their heads through the hole
of the pillory.
The church that Is being erected in "old
Paris" will be one of its greatest attrac
tions. It is a reconstruction of Saint
Jullen dcs Menetriers, the church of the
jugglers and wandering musicians con
structed by their brotherhood in the thir
teenth century. Until the Revolution this
church was the property of these strolling
players. Before it they crowned their
king, held their court and conducted all
manner of revelry. During the exposition
all of these characters will be resurrected.
Minstrels, dancers, jugglers, players of all
musical instruments, will there be con
gregated.
It would take much time and space to
describe all the attractions of "old Paris."
Suffice it to say that every phase of life
as it existed through several certuries
will there be represented. The old palace
of Saint Louis, of Philip le Bel, of Charles
VI, of Louis XII, is being reconstructed.
Those who are ambitious may mingle in
court society, for lords and ladies will be
numerous in all their splendor.

Famous Archers Who Witt) Flying (Arrows Could Rival the Rifle-Scooting Feats
of Buffalo Bill and Dr. Carver.
EVERYBODY has heard the story of
William Toll, who shot an apple
from the head of his son with a bow
and arrow, and of the wonderful
fpats of Robin Hood, who roamed the
green woods of "Merrie England" and
could bring down a wild goose on the
wing or split an opponent's arrow with
his own.
There are many other curious feats of
archery, however, that are not so well
known. There was the famous "William
of Cloudesley, who could split a hazel
wand with his shaft from a distance of
200 yards.
Going much further back, it is said that
some marvelous deeds were performed
by the Persians, who boasted descent
from the famous hero archer, Perses, and
the Scythians, descendants of the great
archer, Scythes. It is related that the
Persians could dr" c one arrow out of the
hole it made with another, at less a long
range, and repeat the feat wTth several
successive arrows at their sand butts.
They also shot from horseback, hitting
a mark while galloping at full speed.
One archer would gallop past a butt and
send two arrows through one hole In
doing so.

many suitors that he only should be
favored

Near the Eiffel Tower preparations are
being made for tho construction of a
queer pa 'ace which will bo built from the
summit to the ground. The laying of the
foundation will be its finishing touch.
This is tho luminous palace Ponsin which
will be made entirely of glass. M. Fon
sin is an artist who has given much time
and attention to the study of glass there
in, producing unimaginable results. For
him glass possesses every possible qual
ity. It is as transparent as air or as
opaque as metal: it is as delicate as lace
or as substantial as iron. In the lumi
nous palace he has undertaken to show
the vast possibilities of his favorite sub
stance. It will be constructed of white
glass, ornamented with huge jewels fine
ly cut in various colors.
Inside there will be divans, exquisite
carpets and even beautiful pictures, all
made of glass. With these appointments
the glassmakers at Venice are now busily
occupied. The palace will be crowned by
a colossal statue of Hlectricity, which,
mounted on colorless glass, will appear to i
be standing in air without a support.
At night, brilliantly lighted by elec- j
tricity, one may Imagine how bewilder- j
Ingly beautiful will be the effect. To in- '<
tensify it, the palace will be situated on a i
lake, whore electric fountains will play '
and in which will swim glass fish and
aquatic birds, all luminous at night with
electricity. Under the palace will be a '
wonderful grotto, hung with glass stalac- j

The Romans were very skillful bowmen,
although they discarded the weapon in
warfare, trusting to the charge and to
hand-to-hand fighting. Many of the Ro

is said that Domitian would place boys I
in the circus at a considerable distance j
from him, and as they held up their i
hands, with their fingers outspread, he :
would send his arrows between them with :
such nicety and accuracy of aim that he
never inflicted a wound.
The wicked Emperor Commodus boasted
that he never missed his aim or failed to
! kill the wild beast that he shot at with i
i a single arrow. He would set a shaft in '
his bow, as some wild beast was set free j
I in the circus to devour a living criminal
; condemned to die. Just when the furious
: animal was springing on his* prey the Em
j peror would strike it dead at the man's

one hundred arrows, might kill them all.

i There will be no Midway Plaisance at

position than this tour of the world. The
building, of enormous proportions, is al
ready nearly completed. It is called a
panorama, but deserve:.; a better name to
distinguish it from the stereotyped pano
ramas of which we are all so weary.
The trip commences with a departure
from the port of Marseilles. The light

heart's content upon the Acropolis, with
the Parthenon and other monuments of
past glory- With this view there will be
I no animated scenes. Why, " do not know,
unless to suggest the mournful fact that
the Athens In which we are really in
terested there are to-day no living repre
sentatives. From Greece the traveler
crosses the Dardanelles and the Bosphor
us to Constantinople, where he mingles
with real Turks.
From there to Egypt and India, enjoy
ing in the meantime the life of the Suez
Canal and the characteristic dances of the
countries. At Ceylon he will witness the
power of the snake charmers over live
cobras, and in Hindostan the marvelous
feats of jugglery for which the natives
are famous. In China and Japan he will
| drink tea at the teahouses, promenade
i through- rice fields and invoke Buddha if
Ihe likes in the temples. Little Mme.
; Chrysanthemes in flesh and blood will
smile and dance for him. Through
' Oceanica. Africa and America he passes
i before reaching Europe again. Arrived in
I Spain he will hear the chink of castanets
and see scores of pretty dancing girls. He
will even witness a real bullfight.

"Better be careful," Fred cautioned;
"Condors are mean beasts and might
pick your eyes out. But if you're going,
so am I."
With that both men started to climb
the cliffs. For arms they took along a
couple of heavy sticks and determined to
fight if the birds attacked them.".
To reach the c^ve into which the con

task. The weather was warm and to
climb the 300 feet to the top proved try

foothold -was almost impossible and- a

Nearly an hour was consumed in get

remained the task of crawling along a
narrow ledge, so as to get inside and se
cure the condor's nest.
This ledge was only about seventeen
feet long, but from it to the bottom of
the canyon the walls went down almost
as straight as the walls of a building. It
was a situation that called for nerve and
daring. ;

Curing Idiots.
The surgeon turned away to the next
patient who was being prepared for ope
ration. She was a child lying motionless
on the table and staling upward toward
the great skylight with the hopeless in
difference' of the idiot. lle T - ijps were
thick, her tongue protruded, her hair had
a peculiar silky appearance. She did not

betrayed no uneasiness under the opera
tion and her case was soon disposed of.
The chief surgeon cleansed his hanfls in
the antiseptic washing solution and came
over to where the writer sat.

go. I'll stay here and watch, and If the
old bird gives you too much trouble calT

out." .' ' '
It didn't take Frank more than a couple
of minutes to climb over the ledge and
peer Into the cave. The place where he
stood was comparatively level, and the
opening to the cave was good and large.
"Hurrah!" he shouted, after he had
made a scrutiny of the Inside. "There's
no bird there. She must have left while
we were climbing the cliff. I see one egg
in there, and it's a beauty." ; '
Picking up the egg carefully Frank put
it in his handkerchief and ' swung it
around his neck, so as to have both
hands free to make his perilous trip back

"Yes; we get a Rood many of them

â â¢Mut can you cure Idiocy?"
"Well, we can help her. She is a cretin.
Cretinism is a form of Idiocy caused by
the lack of part of the thyroid gland. It
is a form of goitre Many children have
it. The moment the thyroid secretion
stops forming the development of the
child stops short. If. for instance, the
child had advanced to the age of seven
and then failed of its thyroid, it would
go through life as a seven-year-old child
as far as brain development is concerned.
There is an opposite condition brought
about when too much thyroid secretion is
deposited. We know it then as exophthal
mic goitre.
"A person with this malady is the oppo
site of the idiotâ that Is, intensely active
and alert, supersensitive in all things,
the antithesis of dullness, as it were.
Kxophthalmic goitre can be cured by re
moving part of the thyroid gland from the
throat; cretinism can be cured, or rather
held in check by administering thyroid
extract to the idiot. Jf a child is taken
young and properly doctored with thyroid
extract it will go on developing Ju^t like
any normal child. Butâ and here is a
possibility for a novel writer- if the ad
ministering of the extract should be
stopped suddenly the youngster would re
lapse into its former idiotic state or at
any rate stop off where it was. Think of
:i curs.' of Idiocy hanging over one's head
constantly!"
'â¢'What causes the condition aside from
its physiological features?"
"Well, that is not exactly known. The

The progress America is making in university education, and this
means the education of wflinen, is one of the most real and potent tnflu
i nces In shaping our national character and destiny. The relative higher
Intelligence of the masses makes thorough mental discipline indispensable
in the few. Not only are the multitude more intelligent than thry have
ever been, but the best knowledge on .ill subjects is now within the reach
of many readers. In every community, in every audience, there are some

Beauty of feature and above all beauty of expression are heightened
In women by intellectual culture. The more women learn to live in the
sen ne air of delightful Study the longer they retain the freshness and
charm of youth. Ktftfcatlon is simply the process whereby the powers
W|llch constitute a hitman being are strengthened, developed and brought
Into action. If these endowments are good, education is good, and the
lest is best, whether for man or woman. What interests the one must
interest the other. Whot benefits the one must benefit the other. Women,
no lean than men. need ntxoqg and (.pen minds, the capacity to form defi
nite id. as and sound judgments, to deduce conclusions logically from
premises, to weigh evidence find to estimate the value of proofs. They,
more tl-an men. are too much dominated by the senses, and a better edu

What shall women learn? Whatever experience and the insight of tho
wisest have shown to have most efficacy in opening, strengthening and
supplying the mind. It is sufficient for those who cannot or will not take
up the work of intellectual culture in a serious spirit to have a superficial
acquaintance with the higher things In education, but it Is unfair to
women to place them in this class. The chosen ones to impart knowledge
are not found In one sex alone. Woman's average intelligence is not less
than that of man. If no one of her sex has been able to enter the small
circle of supreme achievement ft is due to the force of custom, habit,
opinion and law. and not to inferiority of mental endowment. If a few

who caught it and quickly hid it between
two large stones. - : :'^ ..â '.
Then the fight began. At sight of the
egg the two condors became furious.
They turned their attention to Fred, who
had all he could do to beat them off. even
for a few minutes. Twice they swooped
down on Frank and tore his clothes with

stun her. She fluttered in the air and
then dropped to a rock about fifty feet
below; followed by her mate.

make her discontented with her proper work. It Is said that these unfit
her to become wife and mother, take from in-r something of th.' sweetness,
purity and moral beauty Which constitute ber greatest charm, and on
which the welfare of the race so largely depends. A learned woman still
appears to some of us to be an abnormal being.
TliÂ» adversaries of the highest intellectual culture tor women -ither
do not understand what ."duration is or do not believe In its divine effl-
Cacjr. Education teaches us that the Indelible stain on the page of history
is the world's treatment of woman. It also reveals to us a splendor which
falls on our own country more than on any otherâ the position and the
opportunities this nation has given to woman in the present century.
Through the past igea man has been unjust to man, even cruel: but
woman seemed almost beyond the pale of humanity. She was a drudge, a
slave, a chattel. She whs to be bought and sold, a plaything in idle hours,
and for the rest to be immured In the two-fold darkness of ignorance and
ronfSning walls.
To discourage the higher education of women is to enfeeble the. race.
To destroy, the self-confidence of woman is to blunt her ambition, instead
of spurring it. Vet it has been held wise and by many is still thought
proper to take a fleprecatory tone whenever there is a question of conced
ing to women the opportunities of education and work which are given to
men. AYe should assume their capacity: we should have them to believe
that they are able, and then they will be able. We should applaud and
assist every effort made by women themselves to uplift, strengthen and
enlighten women. It is the privilege and the glory of the Knglish-speaking
people, with the noise of whose deeds the world is filled to-day, to have
been the first to understand woman's right to the highest education, and
to provide for her the opportunities.

"Yes," answered Fred.
"All right; let the birds come."
And the birds did come. Like whirl
winds they swooped down on the two
men. The attack was* met with a series
of blows from the clubs. But in such a
position it was a difficult matter to strike
a telling blow at a moving object and but
little harm was done the condors. â  JÂ£"l
Again and again the vicious birds at
tacked with talons and bill and beat
fiercely with their wings. Both men were
scratched and torn and their clothes were
in ribbons. They were beginning to tire.
At this point Prank put all his strength
into a blow that caught the largest condor
square on lop of the head. This prac
tically knocked out the big condor, but
the other came on with redoubled fury.
She scratched and clawed and pecked,
but the two men were too much for her.
The steady shower of blows began to tell
and she flapped weakly for a few minutes
and then lamely flew off to console her
disabled mate, who was nursing his sore
head on a rock about ion feet away.

MARRIED FLIRTS.
By Ella Wheeier Wilcox.
Mrs. YCilcox-rDear Madam: I wish you would state in one of your
letters your opinion on the following:: Which man makes the most "dan
gerous flirt â the r>ne who as a youth was always fond of the society of
girls, or the one who preferred the company of his own sex'
IMUST confess this Is a difficult problem. *
There are so many kinds of men flirts.
The born "ladies' man" belongs to an old-time school. He is "good
looking'.' and agreeable. He usually sings, and if he has no voice he
learns enough of music to improvise accompaniments for women who
H^ is versed in small talk, and knows how to compliment a woman on
lie looks unutterable thines without saying them and he is careful
not to compromise himself.
H^ vies riot care much for the society of men. and men care less for him.
Virile, manly men invariably smile when his name is mentioned, and the
malicious speak of him irreverently. Women are always at hand, however,
to spring to his rescue and defend him with vigor.
lie inspires a great many small passions, and is the hero of weak, social
melodramas. Young girls grow sentimental over him. but he is a man to
be easiiy forgotten when other and more aggressive lovers appear upon
â 
Everybody calls him a flirt, but he does no real harm, and he enjoys life
like a male butterfly. His deepest love is only a warm friendship for the
â¢
The man who despises women in his secret heart and who acts the
lover to them only to prove to himself and to observers how weak and im
moral the sex is makes a far more dangerous flirt. He is usually a man
among men. "a good fellow" with his own sex, generous and open-handed,
Shrewd in business matters and interested In sports. Women are his diver
sion, and he regards them as a pack of cards, to be shuffled and dealt as
hf chooses. He breaks the hearts of innocent girls, betrays the weak, mis
leads silly wives, and laughs at them all. He marries a simple and rather
Btupii sriii '.ate in life and lives happily forever after.
Tho man who has been deceived by the girl he trusted and becomes a
flirt put of revenge is another type. He goes about Jike a roaring lion seeking
whom he may destroy. But ho has a heart full of pent-up affection, and
before he knows it Fume shrewd woman has caught him upon the rebound
and she teaches him that his belief in woman was not lost â it was only ob
sci:r-:d. And he spends the rest of his life in worshiping the woman who
has restored his faith and in regretting the harm he did between his first
and last dream of love.
[There is still another sort of flirt, who has a weakness for becoming en
gaged to several girls at one time. He is found in country towns and is al
ways in hot water. He means no harm, but he finds it impossible to resist
proposing to a girl who smiles and encourages him.
There is. too. the disdainful man, who never seems to more than tolerate
women, yet who Is always surrounded by adoring fair ones of all ages, who
are fascinated by his disdain. They are the spaniel-natured women, who
folio '.v the master who kicks them.
I have a dozen or more letters written by unhappy wives who ask my
advice.
One woman says her husband earns 58 a day and gives her $1 grudg
ingly. With this $6 a week he expects her to pay rent and to feed and
clothe three people. He is cross, unsympathetic and quarrelsome. She says
her life is miserable and asks me how she can get a divorce.
lam not a lawyer nor a divorce agent. She must find out elsewhere â¢
Of course a man should give his wife a reasonable sum of money with
which to provide a home, and if she has no system in her management he
should teach her, as he would teach a clerk or office boy. Having married
a wife he should use every effort to make her a helpmeet.
Another wife says her husband finds fault with her cooking and
praises other women who are less skilled than she; and so the complaints
pour in, potty and great, written by all sorts of women from the intel
lectual and cultured to the woefully ignorant.
Often in public conveyances I look at "the faces I see and wonder if they
belong to my .... /,..;â ,=
I see women almost every day who I know would drive me to drink or
madness were I a man and obliged to associate with them.
Women who hang upon a car strap and look injured while there are
three empty seats behind them; women who spread themselves over two
seats and ignore the fact that other women or tired men are standing- women
who try to attract attention in public places; women who toss much-be
plumed hats and drag filthy skirts over horrible pavements- women who
crowd each other at shopping counters, and slam doors in each other's faces
These are all of them women who would make thoughtless and stunid
wives, and most inefficient mothers, and who would aggravate a man beyond
description, and never be able to understand why he was aggravated.
I wish all these unhappy wives who have written me would analyze their
own conduct and see if they have been guilty of any or all of these dv
agreeable ways.
They may have been the means of the first disillusionment. Even an
ignorant and selfish man is impressed by tact and thoughtfulness and consid
eration for others in a woman. He is' sometimes reformed and refined by
p.ssociation with such a woman. . * ~
I have seen a very disagreeable and fault-finding man become a good
natured and companionable husband by the example of a human sunbeam
who laughed at troupe, -and whose gentle, unselfish life was better than any
sermon ever preached in its influence for good.
A wife is a great power, and she can mold and shape the average man
into the sort of a husband she wishes, If she begins ! soon enough, and has
enough patience ant" tact.â Ella Wheeler Wllcox in New York Evening

";ts is" n bathing suit.
It may take some endurance to swim,
bur It t:ik -s more to select a. bathing suit.
i- There are all sorts ar.d kinds, of every
' conceivable material and of every shn.de
from bilious orange to sickly green. But
y<ui must wade through thr-m all until
you find one that comes up to the revised
standard.
For, be it known that the nevr bathing
suit In nowise resembles those that for
merly were guaranteed to make the heart
go pit-a-pat.
The new lathing suit hns no . nil ages
Thru spoil the outlines of the figure.
Sailor collars, revers, lapels, epaulets â
these are all tabooed. The bath! suit of
last year, with its vest and bit collar, is
r.'p more. When the girls ran down the
beach last summer their flapping white
collars made them look like a flock of
seagulls. This year they will look like a

For the new bathing suit has been built
to suit the fashionable figure. The fash
ionable figure Is slender, but nut lanky.
The fashionable figure has a small waist,
but the hips must likewise not be large,
for the nval-lÂ«as;-tied-in-tfiâ¬-mifldle' figure
nor the hour-glass figure are comrne il
faut: The fashionable bathing suit Is
built along the lines of the fashionable
ilgure.
Therefore it has the "Zaza" belt, which
gives the "Zaza" curve at the waist line.
The "Zaza" belt; worn by Mrs. Leslie
â¢ â â .rtiT in the play of that name, is really
â¢( >p^nsil>le for the new figure. It is a
belt very high in the back and drawn
\ cry low and to a jw>int at the waist line
. in front. It. is a belt impossible with large
* hips. So on with the belt and off with the
hips has been the cry of lovely woman tor
the past few months.
The new bathing suit not only has the
"X.;iZii" belt but many of them have the
t'Zaza" coliar as well: a high collar with
triangular points i turned down over the
.â lee that makes the. well poised head look
like a flower rising out of its calyx.
The sleeves of the new bathing suits are
small; ;;n<l the skirts are close-fitting over
the hips, with a becoming fullness at the
kliee.
Light colors combined with white are
more popular than th>- usual blue and
black with (olor combinations. The
bathing suit worn by Miss Helen Ber
tram is ;i ]>ale blue with white stripes.
Delicate shades of this sort are going to
J â¢ â  ::. high favor with feminine bathers.
The material used la a matter of choice,
or, rather, of use. For a bathing suit In
tended for the water and one designed
f'-r dry land are naturally made up of en
tirely^different materials. For practical'
purposes something that has wool in its
composition; for picturesque purposes
something with hi sheen of silken
thread? to shimmer in the sunlight.
And this, above all things, when pur

more important articles have likewise
had the solemn seal of approval stamped

Shirt waists when made of cotton ma
terial do not differ very much from their
sisters of seasons gone by. The yoke In
the back is still pointed, but not nearly
so deep as the yoke of last year.
The sleeves this y?ar are even smaller
than those worn heretofore, and the cuffs
i ..re rounded off at the edges.
â â *â  The stiff linen collar is not viewed with
favor. In its stead we have pique stocks

Used in place of a sponge, it is a never
ending delight. Of course, it could not be
substituted for the large bath sponges,
but foi applying lotions to the face or
tonics to the hair it is really unexcelled.
It is particularly beneficial In bathing the

Have you ever tried absorbent cotton
in place of dress shields? If you have I
am certain that never again will you use
aii} - of those abominable, odoriferous rub
ber shields that you have been accus
tomed to. Even in their fresh, unused
state they are unpleasantly suggestive
of the agonies of the dentist's chair, and
when combined with the odor of the secre
tions of the skin the result is a most try
ing <>iie to any woman with a sense of
nil i ty and cleanliness.
But the cotton. There is nothing to
compare with it. It is sweet, and pure and
absorbs every particle of perspiration,
keeping it from coming through to one's
waist and apparently absorbing the odor
at the same time.
Cut a pair of shields out of linen or mus
lin, and inside each one place a good
sized piece of absorbent cotton. Fasten
with little tapes and sew Inside your
sleeves just as you would any dress pro
tector. These can be washed as often
as one chooses. Even if this were not so,
one could keep a supply on hand suffi
cient to last through the summer without
hearing the straining of the purse strings,
The extreme fancies will hardly be de
sirable. Shapes arc plain, but trimmings
must be line and close..- however* elab
orate. Not much of the frou-frou and
soft fluffy effects is seen in the best de
signer! goods. Narrow fine appliques of
chiffon, narrow ribbons, narrow laces, fine
eordings, nicking"* and hemstitching^ af
ford a sufficient variety of ideas to render
the twenty â¢to twenty-two inch shapes
sufficiently elaborate to please any taste.
Novelties are not absent, but the more
striking ideas are in materials them
selves, rather than in the methods of
handling-. The particularly beautiful ar
ticles produced by machinery in this
country to-day represent what would
have been hand work at fabulous prices
a decade ago. Most superb tuckings,
cordlngs, hemstltchings and shirrings, so
like hand work as to be indistinguishable,
are utilized in quantity and then sold at
prices that would represent- one-fifth of

world to train the eyebrows to almost
any shape. Rubbing a little vaseline or
cocoanut oil into them and good brush
ing will make them luxuriant, and where
thoy are too wii - for beauty take a small
pair of tweezers and carefully remove the
superfluous hairs. The . hair that prows
down by the ears will probably not stay
back until it has grown lonp enough to
be brushed back over the ears. I should

Try the following for the moth patches,
although I doubt if it will help you if the
trouble, comes from a disordered liver, as
it probably doer;: Cocoa butter, 10
grams: castor nil. 10 grams; oxide of
zinc. 20 centigrams; white jirecipitate;
]0 centigrams: extract of rose, 10 drop:?.
Apply at night and carefully wash
away with warm water the following
morning. T should not put a particle n't
faith in the advertisement you inclosed
The treatment you are follow 'ng will do
you just as much good if persisted in and
cannot possibly harm you. Also hat
the breasts in cold water In the morning.
Swinging Indian clubs and dumbbells will
also help. I ' should be very glad to
have .the prescription you mention.
MISS E.L.â Pure- lemon juice with a
little bora?: added is as good as anything
to remove freckles. I fear T can suggest
nothing for that "Cyrano" difficulty.
NAOMIâ Your powders could not have
been made of pure materials, or else it
was not properly mixed. When using
cold cream on the face at night it should
be rubbed in. left on for a few minutes
and then every bit of it rubbed off with a
soft towel. In the morning wipe the faco
off In tepid water. I see no reason why
you should not be able to use the skin
food, although to some skins all oils
are irritating. The difficulty with your
skin, no doubt. Is that the sebaceous
glands are inactive. Have you over tried
steaming the face? A good camphor ice
is sometimes better than a cold cream or
skin food in such cases.
GREENIEâ Your complexion is not in a
healthy condition or it would not be so
dry and liable to fluff off in tiny flakes.
1 doubt very much if you should' use any
soap on your face, as it will â >: i .- help to
remove the small quantity of oil there is
in the cuticle. The orange flower skin
food would refresh your fading skin In
Bbort order. Take, one-half ounce o.acn of
spermaceti and white wax and cut into
shaving. Melt and add one ounce each
of lanolin, and cocoanut oil and two
ounces of oil of sweet almonds. Melt all
these, but do not let boil. Remove from
heat and stir in quickly one ounce of or
ange flower water and ten drops simple
tincture of benzoin. Then beat till fluffy
and nice. Until your skin gets into better
; shape I would advise you to use very lit
tle water on it. but to rely on the' skin
food for cleansing. The formula tot
liquid powder that you inclosed is all
rightâ that is. the ingredients are all per
fectly harmlessâ but I think you will find
it very drying and particularly con
ducive to the flaky condition that you
are already complaining of. An excellent
formula for a quinine hair tonic is one
half pint of water, one-half pint of alco
hol and 2."> rents' worth of quinine. I have
heard that bathing bald spots on the head
every morning with water just as hot as
the scalp will allow will start the hair to
growing. You might try it on the hus
band's pate. Advice to Duchess will be
of help to you in getting rid of the black
heads on your nose. Don't squeeze them
out. That only irritates them.
MISS DAISY BELLâ Systematic mas
sage with the orange flower skin food will
straighten your skin out in a jiffy. It is
in need of nourishment, no doubt, and
this the skin food will supply.
H. L.â The sage tea tonic" for the hair
is made by. boiling a package of sago
leaves in a quart of water until there is a
pint of the liquid. Strain carefully
through muslin and add one tablespoonful
of bay rum or alcohol. Apply to the roots
of the hair just before going to bed at
night. Do not use this tonic on light hair,
as it has a darkening effect. Please read
what I have said to Greenie about bald
heads.
VIOLETTE DE PARME-Of course
you can get rid of the coarse pores.
Scrub them every night of your life with
a complexion brush, tepid water and cas
tile soap This treatment may seem at
first to make the pores more gaping, but
if persisted in will surely end in refining
â  the skin. When the pores have become
emptied of their secretions use the as
tringent wash suggested to Duchess. I
always advise the tepid sponge bath in
the morning, as being the most likely to
agree with every one. only the most ro
bust being able to indulge in the icy
sponge or plunge.
IDA W.â l do not approve of hot v:ater
for the face. -.lt robs the skin of all soft
ness and makes it taut and stiff and liable
to chap. Tepid water is better. lam un
familiar with the cold cream you name,
so cannot vouch for its purity or excel
lence. I do know that lanolin in its pure
state is more than likely to develop a- fine
crop of whiskers. I wish you would try
the skin food suggested to Greenie. I am
sure it will help you. Use it at night, Just
before ' going to bed, and then once or
twice during the day apply the following
astringent wash, allowing it to dry on the
skin: Take a half pint bottle and place
in it three tablespoonfuls of fresh, un
cooked cucumber juice. Half fill the bot
tle with elder flower water and then add
two tablespoonfuls of eau de cologne.
Shake well and add very slowly half an
â  ounce of simple tincture of benzoin, shak
ing the mixture now and then.

complete control.
"He knows me, master, and I know him." 'replied Aaron.
It was not a satisfactory answer, perhaps, but it seemed to be Buf
ficletit. t*p hill the horse, which was a strong one, went with a long,
swinging trot. The top reached, the trot would be exchanged for a gallop.
This went on for some time, until Aaron vetoed the gallop. When they
hail gone on for an hour, and were nearly to Harmony Grove, a small set
tlement about ten miles from the Abercrombie place, the son <>f Ken All
stopped the horse, jumped from the buggy and carefully examined the
road ahead, getting down on his hrmds and knees to do SO.
He rose and shook his head, and walked slowly back to the buggy.
"What is the matter?" \h<- White-Haired Master asked.
"'lli' wagon p.ln't c ime 'long here, master. The wheel tire is two
inch) * wide. No track like that in the road."
"It was an army wagon," said the grandfather, musingly. "What has
becon ;' It? It must have passed here. The first fork in the road Is at
Harmony Grove. We'll go there."
Elviry Ran
to the Door
to See What
Was Creating
All the
Cori)motioo.
And bo they drove on to Harmony Grove. As it happened, there was a
sort of social gathering in the Bchoolhouse. As always happens on such
occasions, there were several young men and boys who were too shy to
venture In the house where the girls and young women were. If a wagon
or. vehicle of any kind had passed they surely would have seen it. But no
wagon had passed.
Such of them as had horses volunteered to join the searching party,
but the White-Haired Master thanked them. If the wagon hadn't passed
it was still on the road somewhere, and he and Aaron would find it. In
deed, the White-Haired Master had made a calculation. Harmony Grove.
was ten miles from his place. He had come the distance in something less
than an hour, and it was now 10 o'clock. If the wagon had left the spring
at 8 o'clock it could hardly have reached Harmony Grove before then.
Aaron judged that they should have overtaken the v wagon about six miles
from the spring.
A.S a matter of fact, thdy had overtaken the wagon and passed it five
and one-half miles from home, â >r. to be more exact, at the humble resi
dence oi Mr. Barlow Bobs. They had passed the wagon without knowing
it. for the reason thai the vehicle was not in Right from the road, and
they would have passed it in broad daylight.
The driverâ Mr. Roby Ransomâ that was really his name, a? it turned
out had not gone more than two miles from the Ahercromble place before
th<- desire to Bleep overcame him. an,d he began to nod. For awhile he
â¢would noil and then rouse himself, but finally he leaned against the frame
work, over which the cover was spread, and began to sleep soundly. The
lines Slipped from his hands, but caught on the brake and hung there, too
high for the feet of the. mules to become entangled in them.
When the wagon came to the top of the long hill that slopes down to
Crooked Creels the mules were surprised to feel no restraining hands on
the reins. At first they hardly knew what to do, but they were well
trained and they held back the wagon until near the bottom, and then they
broke Into a swift trot and went swishing through the shallow waters of
("rooked Creek. Without a pause they pulled the wagon sedately up the
opposite hill, whirh was not a very steep one. They remained In the road,
as became sensible mules,. but they became more and more uncertain In
their movements as they realized that no hand was guiding them.
Finally they came to the humble home of Mr. Ronsâ or. rather, they

But dawn came at last, and as soon as things were visible the two were
in the buggy and away When they had gone two or three miles toward
home Aaron Jumped from the buggy and strolled on ahead of the horse.
H was quite light by this time, and he scanned the road carefully, search
ing for tin- tracks made by the big wheels of the army wagon. He could
nut find them when' they were not, hut when he came to the short lane
thai led to Mr. Bobs' house he saw where the wagon had turned in. Mak
ing sure thai it had noi come out again, he waited for the White-Haired
Master to come up. He said noi a word, bul pointed to the tracks made
by the wheels.
Now it happened that Mr. Bobs had his sister, Miss Kiviry, for his
housekeeper. Miss Kiviry was W odd years old and quite independent of
servants, and it was her habit to rise at daybreak summer and winter,
kindle Into a blaze the fire that had been wrapped into a blanket of ashes
the night before, and proceed to conk an early breakfast, so that her
brother might gel to work at his turning lathe or his broom making as
booh as possible. Miss Elviry went to bed early and rose early, as a mat
ter both of conscience and habit. But on this particular' morning she rose
earlier than usual. She had a "fellin'," as she afterward expressed it, that
everything was noi all right. Once or twice, when she woke (hiring the
night sht' heard the house dog littering smothered growls and whining, a
certain sign That everything was not as it should be. She refrained from
musing her brother, but she had a good mind to. She mad" up for her
restraint in this matter, however, by rising half an hour earlier herself.
Sh.' kindled a fire, put on a supply of wood to keep it going and hurriedly
dressed herself Then, although the stars were shining, she unbolted the
back door and looked out. The little outhouse in which Mr. BobÃ did his
work and kept his tool? barred her vision, but she heard unusual noises,
such as the rattle of chains and the creaking of harness and the snorting
of horses or mules.
Now Miss Kiviry was not n timid woman. She had some of the indo
pendence and energy that would have made her brother more prosperous
had he possessed a fair share of them. So, while she was astonished at
,1,,, noises she heard, she was not alarmed. Instead of mshing Into her
brother's room to arouse him, she seized the ax. -which was always brought
in over night in case of an emergency, and sallied out to see what It was
that had taken possession. ,' .. . ...
The bouse dog heard her. and came out from under the house fairly
sen Lining with delight, for hÂ« had a horrible night of it. Feeling himself
adequately reinforced by Miss Elviry's presence, his bristles rose and he
rushed around the outhouse and proceeded to hay at the back end of the
wagon with the greatest fury, and his indignation grew even greater when
he heard Miss Elviry's firm voice urging him to "Sic 'em, Spot! Sic 'em!"
The voice aroused Sweetesi Susan, hut did not seem to disturb the other
sleepers The child rubbed her eyes, but for a long moment she could not
Imagine where she was. Then she remembered she was in the wagnn when
she should be at home in bed. And, "Oh, what will mamma say?' Dawn.
Â«till glimmering fnr away, sent a glimmer of light into the wagon, and
toward thi-- Sweetest Susan groped her way. stumbling over Drusilla, who
merely turned over with a sigh that sounded like a groan.
"Who are you. anyhow 0 " cried Miss Elviry, sharply.
"(Hi It's only me 1 " answered Sweetest Susan, whose head and sh.onH
ers were dimly outlined against the interior darkness of the wagon. "Take
me oul nl.:. sÂ». Oh, this is not home. Where am I."
\li^s Elvirv went nearer; there was something about the child s voice
that drew her. "Oh, bush up. Spot!" she cried to the dog; "now you've
started you'll never Btop." She went close to the wagon end and looked
at the child as well as she could. "What's your name, honey?" ,
Now as Boon as Miss Kiviry came nearer the child s sharper vision
She made quilts and wove counterpanes for people who

service and taxation, likewise the right
to administer justice, to appoint Mayors,
parsons, schoolteachers, Judges and po
lice Officers within tho limits of the Clef.
Bavaria attends to the post, the tele
graph, the levying of recruits And taxes.
All other branches of administration are
vested in the "reigning" Prince.
But, say the Munich reports, Marlbor
ough laid seemingly little stress on these
rights, which appear to a German as the
height of ambition. His negotiations for
reinstatement were solely dictated by a
desire to give his American wife a stand
ing among the royalties of the continent
of Europe, and, receiving assurances that
Consuelo and her children should share
his title, he did not hesitate to pay over
to the crown of Bavaria the very large
sum demanded. The i Jtact figures could
not be learned. The. real estate Becured
in the bargain is worth only about ;
to $30,000. but when a man like Marlbor
ough must choose between dollars and a
beloved wife's ambition, he cannot afford
to haggle.

the European continent, particularly

This rule never was acknowledged by
Greal Britain, and Queen Victoria, though
Girma.ii in many other respects, openly
disavows it. and treats the ladies Buffering
from its unjust, discrimination with
studied courtesy. Thus she conferred the
title of "Princess Edward of Saxe-Wel

daughter of the Duke of Richmond and
Gordon, when ihat lady married Prince
Edward, her Mai. sty's Held marshal and

"Did you ever in all your born days!" exclaimed Miss Elviry. Then she
ran to the wagon, smiled at the child and little Billy Biscuit laughed back
at her. When she took him in her arms he put his small arms about

Miss Elviry's only reply to this was to kiss the baby and squeeze him

forgotten the poor little thing. She ran to him now. and would have
taken him in her arms, but he. thinking she was up for a frolic, kicked
his feet, laughing and screaming In glee, and clung to Miss i-.iviry.
Nevertheless the child was a problem. What was to be done with

THIS hand shows a forceful, determined nature, aggressivn and positive.
Bis long, Intellectual thumb enables him to prosecute his plans with judg
ment. He is rather more willful than logical, and cannot easily he con
vinced that his Ideas are not far superior to those conceived by another. He
is exceedingly Intuitive, and when once impressed with a plan, will turn
heaven and earth to materialize it. He has constructive ability, but not inven
tive genius. He can adapt an article to excellent uses not fo*"Â«ween by the one
who originated it. In other words, he can always improve upo'i another's Inven
tion if It comes within the line of his work. He shows by his spatulate
tipped third finger his ability to express his ideas in an eloquent, concise, manner.
He is restless and active, always devising new schemes. He has marked me
chanical genius, and his life Hue being so closely Followed by his head line would
prove thai he would exercise due caution In his surgical operations. He is an
ideal physician, for he can not only prescribe and eradicate the existing path
ological conditions, but he can teach his patient a better mode of life. He has the
power of Influencing others to a large degree. He is practical and outspoken
and would be Inclined to .state facts rather too forcibly. He is not diplomatic
enough for his own good. With his ability he should have been a rich man, but
he has been too conscientious to take undue advantage of others in his business
dealings. He is thoroughly honest and reliable: generous, but not extravagant;
ambitious, but his ambitions are upon humanitarian lines. He is broad-minded,
and could not subscribe to any narrow creed. He has a proper regard for the eth
ical side of life, yet he has no fear of retribution.
He is stanch in friendship, especially when the recipient is of a tractable,
pliant nature, one who would rely upon his judgment Cwhich he values). He is
inclined to be a bit egotistical; fond of admiration, especially by the opposite
sex.
His short fingers would incline his nature to large undertakings; he would be
inclined tn plan for more than his time would permit him to consummate. The
well-defined knots on the fingers gives him a philosophical turn. He hns or
der in material matters and order in ideas. He has great executive powerâex
cellent concentration. The space between the fingers shows his Investigative
mind. His penetration is keenâ in both business matters and in his analysis of
human nature. There is a good life line up to about 7", when aa island shows

X agers indulge in legitimate rival
ry then the playgoer stands a
good chance of getting; his honest due,
to say nothing: about the manager get
ting his. This is being very pleasantly
illustrated by the comic opera produc
tions in the Grand and Tivoll opera
houses. At the one Mr. Southwell's
company is giving a sumptuous pre
sentation of "El Capitan," at the other
the trusty Tivolians are making merry
music and picture in "The Geisha."
Mr. Morosco has finally adopted an idea
that was suggested in this column im
mediately after the opening. I'- has
scaled the prices â â  the Grand down
to an even 25 and sft cents. Besides",
he has put on a piece that is nearly
new and whose name alone is an at
traction. And "El Capitan" and the
prices are drawing the first packed
houses of the season. The people are
beginning to find out the name and
address of the Southwell company, and
incidentally its many excellencies. Th
recent hard luck of the Tivoli company,
which is in old institution forever with
us, has not been a special subJectVof
comment; but the fact stands that the
little opera-house around the corner
piiffprpd weeks of unpopulousness. This
was due to unattractive pieces, a very
bad tenor and an obvious lack of en
thusiasm In the general performance.
But "The Gei?ha," the best of 111 the
modern musical comedies, inspires the
company; the bad tenor is gone and
repla'vd by Frank Coffin (who can sine;
and who will soon learn to act); and
once more the throng finds its way to
Eddy street. The Southwell company
would have suffered much, had it
rut up a stale bill in competition with
"The Geisha"; the Tivoli company
would have stood a chance of becom
ing chronically forgot had it staged an
indifferent piece against "El Capitan."
Each manager knew that the other was
ready for a big (fort. And in result
the town has two rattling good comic
opera productions at the absurd but
magnetic prices of 25 and 50 cents, and
both opera-houses are doing encourag
ing business. Where a man would not
go to either show a week ago he is now
gnjne to both. There is nothing like
competition.
â¢ * *
The Southwell people really do re
markably well in "El Capitan." The
opera is a good one. and unique in that
It is written around a clever, lively
libretto. By itself the book is a good
farce, full of amusing line and situa
tion and well vorked together. A
printed "argument" is not necessary
to an understanding of its plot and
fun. Sou.sa's music is extravagantly
good in several numbers and good
enough in the others. And the annexa
tion of "The Stars and Stripe* For
ever" for the closing chorus of the sec
ond act is one of the most rousing ana
chronisms ever committed in comic
opera. As It is sung and pictured by
that immense stageful of brightly clad,
healthy voiced people the effect is
simply galvanic. In point of ensemble
the Be Wolf Hopper production of "El !
Capitan" in the Baldwin is not to be j
remembered. And don't forget that the
Southwell company is a stock organi
zation with a new piece to put on
nearly every week. The production is
more than creditable; it is just the
special effort that the house needed.
The chorus is huge, well balanced vo- ;
cally, and under rigorous stage man- j
agement. Most of the principals are
good and none is disastrous. Mr, VVoolf
is hardly as humorous a personality as
De Wolf Hopper, but ho is funny just
the same in a legitimate fashion, and j
he sings as few comedians have ever
dared ito do. His assumption of the
title part Is original and entirely a suc
ceps. Mr. Wooley is also to the good
as the Chamberlain. He has not the
diminutive stature of Mr. Klien, his j
predecessor in the part, nor the special
talent for making fun out of pitiable '
situations, but along his own lines of

BARGAINS IN COMIC OPERA.
By Ast}ton Steveos.
I are dainty and modish, and a continu
ously charming stage picture compen
sates for the obese BrltishnesÃ of most
of the spoken dialogue. This is the
i third "Geisha" production at the Tivoli
and in several respects the best. For
one thing the women have advanced
a -â¢â¢ â ;> toward that air of smartness
i that was absent from the earlier pre
sentations. Miss Meyers is less strenu
| ous and more evenly successful than
| Edith Hall was in the part of Molly.
Miss '..â  htor, a bad and apparently un
j ambitious actress at best, limbers up
a bit and uses that pretty, mechanical
voice of hers to good effect in the
i graceful ditties that fall to Mimosa.
: Miss Cooper's Juliette seems to enjoy
; a more secure French dialect and a
â  greater measure of insinuation than
i before, and Tillie Salinger as Lady
j Constance is her placid self unchanged.
j Edwin Stevens, as you know, is at his
! imperious bÂ»st as the Japanese Mar-
I gui?. The part Is more Important as
j the center pin of the play than as the
I medium for the individual glorification
I of the actor, but Mr. Stevens contrives
j to protect his own interests as well as
| those of the piece. I cannot imagine a
j better performance of it than he gives.
j The Chinaman is in the hands of
i Charles W Swain, who, white not as
1 uproariously comic as was Thomas
Leary, gives a very laughable version.
William Pruette, who seems to grow
fat while you wait, does not take kindly
to the modish stride and tailoring of
Reginald Fairfax, but his large, kindly
voice finds comfort in the songs. The
Japanese captain is Frank Coffin's role.
j Its chances are few, but Mr. Coffin
\ makes a considerable most of every
-1 thing that is in sound. In him the
1 Tivoli has at last found a comic opera
\ tenor. After a little histrionic experi
â  ence he ought to be the best in the
history of the house. He not only knows
how to sing, but he has the human
voice. Nobody will call his tenor a
disease.

Lloyd's comedy, in which Mr. Reed is seen

old bachelor.is erroneously regarded by his
friends as a woraan-haitr, while the truth
is that he has unbounded admiration for
the sex and is in love with Mrs. Joy. a
charming widow, in search of her third
: husband. Mr. Bund is such an eligible
] catch that he becomes entrfngrleri -with two
other ambitious widows, and his efforts
to extricate himself from the awkward
predicament is the nrincipal motive of
the story, in which other lovers figure
and are as rivulets to swell the river of
love which is so conspicuous in the case
of Bundy. R< i.-tnd Reed will be seen as

Writes the press agent of the Southwell
Comic Opera Company: "The manage
ment is candid enough to admit this is
not entirely owing to the superb produc
tion and excellent cast and chorus given
'El Capitan,' but also to their adoption
of the suggestion made by The Call that
they should reduce the prices. Each night
the large size of the ludience is convinc
ing evidence of the sagacity of it." The
production will run to another good week.

Under a shrieking caricature of May
Irwin in a recent Dramatic Mirror are
the following lines, headed "The Merry
May":
Fair woman is often a wit. of course,
And often she's clever, too;
But count up the humorous ones you know
And you'll find they're very few.
So take iff your hat and salute just one
As bright as the light of day,
The wonderful woman who makes us laugh,
The marvelous, mirthful May.
And ye who know trouble and care and tears.
Go bask in her cheery smile â
She'll make you forget how to sich and cry,
Sho'll reel your poor h'_'art the while;
And if there yet lingers a shade or so,
Just list to the lauiihin? Mayâ
She'll sine you a s?ons as she only can,
And shadows are sung away.

NKW YORK ST<X - K MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 29.â The market was
heavy practically all day. and while a number
of material recessions appeared '.he general rail
way it-Ms suffered, but fractionally. Stocks
affected by the bill taxing corporation fran
chises in thl? State suffered the most. Metro
politan lost over .'i points, Brooklyn Transit and
Consolidated 'las nearly i. Manhattan a point,
but Third Avenue was an exception, rising 2
points on small dealings on expectation that
that company would biJ for the underground i
franchise. The traders were early sellers in
expectation of .1 bad bank statement, but they j
ccvered when it appeared showing small !
changes, the reserve increasing one and one- 1
third million dollars and loans decreasing about i
half a million. The absence of commission |
ruifllness and weakness of looal stocks caused !
the maritft to ease r.ff again, closing weak. |
London Â«a.< a purchaser of a moderate amount
of slock. Among the strong spots were ("ana- j

a cessation of hostilities left very little
doubt in the Speculative mind that an ultimate
favorable conclusion would be reached within
a reasonable time. At the same time no ap

publicity given, the remarks of United States

the highest in over two years, and the certifi

trading In Anaconda Mining, which made a
net rise of .- ! _.. only Tour points below the best
reached nearly 200,000 shares. The strength
In this stock was associated with the an
nouncement of the Incorporation of the new
copper "trust." which waa to embrace this
company. If the trading In Anaconda, together
with the "Qreen" industrials and local stocks
be subtracted from the total. It .would be
*een that the* trading was very narrow, and
that the standard shares were much neglected
Crew uncertainty, together .with the decrease
of $117.0<)0 in Burlington's surplus earnings for
March, left the grangers fractionally lower
The professional clement Is largely bearish on
certain stock which have experienced an un
usual rise, while the rank and tile are gen

stocks on the belief thaf the present market

will arise stocks from their lethargy if boun

fact that several States have law* Impending

NEW YORK'S FINANCIAL CONDITION.
NEW YORK. April 29. -The New York
Financier says this week: The New York
banks are still accumulating idle reserves, the
j total surplus, according to the current exhibit '
! footing up $25,324,675. The factors which were
1 prominent In the previous statement are still
jin evidence. There has been a further de-
I emasi' In loans, the loss of $385,300 being much
â  less, however, than reported for the week end
! Ing April 22. Deposits have fallen off $804,300,
I and as cash increased over $I.QGO.iÂ»IO. the sur
| plus expanded t1.348.775 The statement is '
j much Letter than bad been looked for. Known
! operations for the week with the sub-treasury
result*,! in a loss of more than three and a
half millions to the banks, and this more than
offset the estimated gain fiom the interior
As II transpired, however, the bank aver
| age.s disclose a better ending for th* week.
it is Immaterial whether the actual condition
of the clearing Institutions Is reflected in these
averages, since the tendency In money affairs
la favoring a continued (low of funds to this
i center and In â  broad sense gains are to be
j expected from this time on. Whatever money
; the banks lost to the sub-treasury during the
I past few days will probably be very much
1 more than recovered through Interest disburse-
I merits and other payments beginning May 1.
Of more Interest than the bank averages Is
the condition of the exchange market, which
is working toward a high level, with the
I probabilities of a still further advance. The
! quotation is now very near the exporting point,
hut that gold will rlow outward is regarded
us extremely doubtful by interests In b posi
tion to know. Money rates abroad do not en
. courage such a supposition, but it will be
I recognized that fluctuations In our domestic
: rates will react sensitively on extreme quota
. tlons. Despite the rise in exchange, which
I on the surface Indicates a liquidation of trade
I balances, the facts go to show that Europe I
! Is still a debtor to the United States, and
I future operations leading to a transfer of gold
I will mean something entirely different from
j the causes which set into motion these forces
In the past.

"Open the >v i forth," demanded Prince I

All this time the two great hands were holding the Prince so
that he could n>>t g^t away. Neither could the hands, which booh
stopped pounding and were pined fast to the door. To open the door
the giants would have pushed it outward. The great hands on the

that had fallen upon the Prince had chilled him. When all the
fingers should have become stone, as the Prince well knew, the
water would run down the giant wrists and upon him. He would
be turned into a .-tone statue. The door would become stone and
the giants would be .walled up alive! That would dispose of the
giants, but it would also dispose of the Prince, who would never be
able to have any more adventures, as a matter of course.

were on the floor, where they

wondered that lie had ever

did not know it. hut he really
was in more danger at this
moment than he had been at

Then I left. My mother went with me

In the night it seemed as if some kind

with its toenall and my head and knees

you can untie the piece of the Black Robe from my sword with your
teeth."
"Very well, ki?i<l master," said the dog.
The sword clattered to the floor and its point was raised In the
air and pointed directly at the throal of Bloodflllikln.
â What have we here?" called the Prince, much surprised. "I
see that this means thai no one shall use the sword or touch the
hilt except me. Take up the sword by the point, Bloodflllikin, and
hold it up so that 1 may untie the knot with my teeth."
Drip! chip! drip! Would the water turn the Prince to stone
while he was working to untie the kn<>t "
Drip! drip' drip! steadily, steadily, like the constant falling of
tears.
BloodfiHikin held bravely to the point of the sword, and the
Prince, reaching the knot with his teeth, pulled at it.
â Hurrah and hurrah!" he said after a time, "the kn<>t is loose!"
"Master," said a mouse courtier, "may 1 help you t<> get free?"
"Yes; 1 will lake your assistance and will pay you well for it."
"What do you mean by that?"
"1 will give you a castle of your own and servants and carriages
drawn by the nicest little ponies ''
"One thing more; let me be an honored guest and feast with
you when you have married the miller's pretty daughter."
"That you shall do you and all y >ur brethren as well."
"Quickly, then; give me the piece "f the Black Robe and T will

1 did."
The mouse whistied and a throng of mice answered t" the call.

A great, fal spider darted from his hole in the wall; the mice
unraveled the piece "f the Black Robe, thread by thread, and the
Bed the thr.ads as they foil and wove them into one stout
< id. The T'lirn" watched the mice and the spider with interest, but
Without any fear.
A me. us.- took i ne end of the cord in his mouth and tied it around
an old helmet of steel that Abramlnidln had worn when he went nut
to battle with th" King's men. Then a score of mice took Hold of
the cord and pulled it after them as they scampered up the stairs
that led to the roof of the castle, close tn the east tower. Their com
bined strength was enough t<> draw the helmet after them. Prince
the supper I did not eat gave m<Â» the
cramps. I was hastily thrown into bed
and covered up with about a ton and
a half of blankets. Then T had to drink
about ten thousand million gallons (my
Imagination) of cinnamon. Rape
and nutmeg tea, and mustard plasters
that were hot enough to burn a hole
through a two-inch board in half a
minute were applied.
About a week after this Mr. Lens,
0114 of the leading photographers in a
near-by town, advertised! for a boj to
help him In the gallery and to learn
photography. I secured" the position.
When I arrived at Mr. Lens' next
; Don't Care heard a splash over his head. At the same instant the
water ceased to drip. The mice came back.
"What have you done?" asked the Prince of the wise mice.
"There is a tank on the roof filled with the tears of little children
whose fathers and mothers were stolon from their homes by the
giants and forced to work In the giants" mim-s underground. When
Al Araaf was planning to keep this castle for his own he passed a
feather, taken from the breasi of a Roc, through the water,
and the. water then had the power to turn t" stone anything that
belonged to th" giants, and also to turn to stone any person who
was touched by the giants of this castle after the giants were
changed into stone. The giants. struggling to open the door to gel
out, have cracked the tank. The water could not be stopped, be
cause of the magic in It. We mice, knowing something of magic,
as many mice do, knew that if we would throw into the tank a cord
made from the Black Robe, sinking it with this particular battle hel
met owned by Abramfnidin, the water would follow the cord to the
ground and would not drop any more. You are safe from that dan
ger How you will get away from the hands of the giants we do not
know. Farewell! We will come back again."
With that the mice ran away, nor could the Prince persuade
them b> stay.
"Oh, well," said the Prince. "I don't care. Bloodfillikin, go up
and see if the tank the mice told about is yet empty. Bring the cord
to me when the last drop has run from the tank, ihat 1 may get the
Spinning Spider to restore the piece Of the Black Robe to me by
weaving the threads together."
Bloodfillikin obeyed. The Spinning Spider agr^-d to weave the
cloth if Prince I Don't Care would promise to give him also a sunny
where there would be many fliesâ a promise which was easy to
get, for Prince I Don't Care had many castles that he had taken
from giants.
"You shall have this castle, and that will save you the trouble
of moving." said Prince I Don't Cue.
Now the piece of the Black Robe is woven and the spider and
the dog wonder what the Prince will think of next
"Good spider," said the Prince, "sine the mice have run away,
go to the pine tree that stands by the castle gate and knock three
times on the tree. A squirrel will come out and will ask you what
you wish. Bloodfillikin will go with you and will carry this piece of
the Black Robe In his mouth. Tell the squirrel to com"-, into the
castle. If he shall say that he will not come, show him the piece of
the Robe, but be sure that he does not touch it."
The dog and the spider went out. They found the squirrel, who
i very hard to be allowed to touch the cloth th.-n the dog car
ried. The wi rds of the Prince were remembered and the squirrel
had to go â  â  Btle without any reward.
"Your task," said the Prince to the squirrel, "will be to gnaw a
hole in the door so ih.-n the hands will fall and let me go free. If
you refuse you will always he a squirrel. Do my bidding and the
In the Black Robe will turn yon bark to your bid condition Of
a Prince of the D< sort."
The squirrel gnawed and gnawed and gnawed. How hard thnt
oak door wfas! Had it been made of flint it could hi I ha,ve been irery
much harder. Tln-ii 11 was very thick. Hut the squlcrel, who was
really a Prince who had been turned Into a squirrel by a magician,
worked fast, and after a time he had a hole gnawed around the
two huge hands of the giant, although he wore out his teeth working
BO haul. As soon as this was done the hands were suddenly hurled
to tl:Â»- floor with great force and were shattered into a thousand
pieces and the Prince was free.
"Now you may touch the Black Robe," said Prince T Don't Care.
] n Â second of time the squirrel was a Prince on^e more.
â 1..; me help yoU to fight the giants:"
"No more." answered Prince I Don't Care. "1 am a match for
â¢ni th" giants alive, and I will not permit any one to share the glory
W l t h m . of freeing the land of their hateful presence."

put it in my pocket, opened the shutter,
forgobrto close it. and then packed the
camera around for about an hour look

til- ;ii;lit <'f the slide and reached into
my pockei i" get it: it wasn't there. I
concluded it would noi do i<> leave th>>
plate in the holder without a slide, so
I took it out, held it up to the sun to
see i!' there was any picture on it.
wrapped it up in my handkerchief and
put it in my pocket. In about three

the plates and returned to -Mr. Lens.

"I â  i < l you fog any of Ihe plat< .- ?"
"Well." I replied, "1 don't know, it
was awful foggy as I came hack, and

plate in my pocket. I tried to keep all
the f"K wtped off with my hahdker

Then there was "wailing." He

"A.Â« you wHL" The Desert Prince made a low hnw and was gone.
Prince I Don't Care was tired and hungry. He did not wait for
the two giants to come after hin>. Finding a hollow tree, he hid
there and feasted upon fruit that was broughi to him by Bloodfllli
kin from Abraminidin'a orchard in thÂ« castle grounds. Then he
slept until he was rested, Bloodflllikin keeping watch. No one dis
turbed him. The giants k> pi within the castle. Not knowing that
the Prince had gone out, they still hoped to have him soon in their
power.
When Prince I Don't ('arc awoke his first labor was to get a
very long and very strong rope and take it to the top of a tall
tree. One end of the rope he fastened to one of the topmost limbs
of the tree. A.l the other end he made a noose. Thfn he shortened
the rope so that the noose- hung about twelve feet from the ground.
Bloodfillikm sal upon his haunches and watched what was done by
his hrav^ master.
"Now," said Prince I Don't Care to the dog, "howl as you have
never howled before, and when the two giants come <>ut of the castle,
point up in the tree, that they may know that I am there.'
BloodfiHikin howled and the giants came running from the castle.
"Good dog," said Abraminidin. "I really believe the hound has
the Prince up the tree, [s that so. good dog?"
For answer the dog pointed upward.
"It is so" said Abraminidin. "How shall we get him down 1 ?"
"1 will go up the tree." answered Hardfist. But. when that giant
tried to climb the tree h>- fell to the ground, having only one hand
to bar g on with.
"We must pull the tree down: that is the right thing, said
Abrai-ninidin "for the limbs are so close together that we could not
drive tlÂ« little villain from the tree in an age. See. here is a rope.
"\\u- (two giants pulled on the rope that Prince I Don't fare had
fastened stoutly to the free. They pulled and pulled and pulled, hut
they could not bend the tree low enough to get at the Prince, who
coolly sat on the topmost branch and laughed at them.
The giants raged at t.te jokes that the Prince was making about
th<i i nn<] still more ai tiieir own lack of success. "If we only had
both of our hands this wonld be an easy task." said Abraminidin.
"I have a way." said ilardfist. "Pull down a little, and then I
will be able to throw the r*>pe over my shoulders. My weight will
then bring the tree low enongh for you to reach the Prince."
THs looked to Abraininiasn to be such a g I plain that he at
Â,,,.,. proceeded to put it im- execution. The rope was placed over
the shoulders of Hardflst.
â¢t'al Abraminidin," he sh wited.
The giants pulled and the t."jee bent very low, but not low enough
for fcbratninidin to reach Prince I Don't ('are.
"Ho 'ho! 5 ' laughed the Prince- "Tou will have to think <-, u t a new
plan. pj6>, blunderheads. ';
AbreiWidin let u<- Â©1 tlw rcfpe, in Ins anger, to try to seize

to an upright position. It wont up So suddenly that the rope caught

I remained with Mr. Lens three
months, and he said it was the busiest
three months he ever had. At the end
of thai time, my parents having madt
a "raise," decided to send me to Bchool
in town. I bought a bicycle to ride to
school for exercise. I- got it.
In about a month I bought a camera
and took pictures of my schoolmates,
whereby I might remember them when
far away. <>n my way home as I cam.'

my hand, tho bicycle for* broke and I

not been In the habit of dismounting
that way. but 1 wanted to catch the

In my haste to catch the wheel l threw
the camera cm the ground harder than
was necessary and scattered it all over
the road.

FROM mortal eyes thy wrestling waters hide
Wrecks, that through age- "neath thy waves have lain;
Ami while thy billows burst and form again
Winded inspiration rides the coming rtdÂ«.
Thou restless Ocean, rolling far and wide.
That sendeth fancies through my fevered brain,
Thy deafn'inj! blasts are but the wild retrain
That to the forest winds has long replied.
As dreaming thus T linger on thy strand
Thrm makest me to think of man's small part
In this great universe that 'round Ui lies.
Thy wondrous waste, whencalmer. I have scanned
And wondered that thou holdest in thy heart
The darkest mvsterk-s beneath the skies.

about a rod. but .1 was getting my head

about a mile a minuste, meanwhile leav

where a lazy man w.virs them out first.
I saw that if I kepi up this rate of

anything left to sit down on but the
end of my backbone. In about half a
second I hit a fence and suddenly
stoppedâ 3o suddenly that I felt as if
I had telescoped and turned wrong
side out. After "pulling" myself to

them on my shoulder and started down

with considerable fervor. I did not at

NEW ESSAY BY DR. BURGESS.
A brief essay on "A Question of Con
sciousness." by Dr. O. O. Burgess of this
city, baa attracted the attention of scien
tific nun. Its point Is, apart from r<
tton, to prove the Individualized! immor
tality of the human soul. The argument
is closely knit together and is expressed
with unusual ters< ness and precision. Dr.
Burges ds the human body as a
material and transitory complexity, and
therefore perishable; bui the soul
emanation from the our- substance of
eternal being, wrought into a segregated
personality by the experiences of lif<
because it is simple and elementary, in
capab th or fundamental change.
The essay is marked by originality and
well deservea the concentrated attention
it exacts.
