VICTORIOUS
ADVANCE OF
AMERICANS
Aguinaldo's Forces Fleeing
to Malolos for a Final
Stand.
MANILA, March 26, 7:30
p. m. â The United States
troops under Brigadier-
Generals Hall and Lloyd Wheat
on captured the town of Malinta,
beyond the Tuliahan River, to
day after a sharp fight. Colonel
Harry C. Egbert, of the Twenty-
Second Regular Infantry, was
killed. Prince Loewenstein, for
merly aid-de-camp on the staff
of Brigadier-General Miller at
Iloilo, somehow got in front of
the firing line and was shot in the
tide, dying almost instantly. A
German who accompanied him
was wounded.
The American casualties to
day were much lighter than those
of yesterday, the total losses thus
far reported since the engage
ment commenced being 45 killed
and I4t wounded.
General Wheaton entered Ma
linta, which is a small village of
hyts, at 1 o'clock this afternoon.
The United States gunboat Hel
ena and other gunboats have
been shelling Malabon, about a
mile northwest of Caloocan, for
several hours. . t
The San Francisco Call.
The insurgents made a fierce
resistance to the American ad
vance up the railroad at Malinta.
In addition to the fatal wounding
of Colonel Egbert, several men
of the Twenty-second Infantry
and several men of the Oregon
and Kansas regiments were
killed.
Evidently anticipating a bom
bardment by the fleet, a thousand
rebels vacated Malabon last
night, leaving a few to burn the
town. General Wheaton's bri
gade, composed of the Second
Oregon regiment and the Twen
ty-second and Twenty-third In
fantry, stretched out along the
railroad from Caloocan to the
I Tuliahan River, was powerless to
prevent the withdrawal, owing to
the natural obstacles and to the
strong opposition.
A column of smoke at day
â break was the first intimation of
the enemy's intentions, but oth
ers followed at various points, all
soon blending in a dense balloon
shaped cloud. The flames of the
burning rice mills and large
buildings could be plainly seen
SAN FRANCISCO, MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1899.
INSURGENTS DRIVEN
FROM ENTRENCHMENTS
General Otis' Report of the Advance of the
Flying Column Under Mac Arthur,
WASHINGTON. March 26.â The War Department
to-night received the following:
"MANILA, March 26. â Adjutant - General, Washing
ton: Mac Arthur's advance beyond New Canavan, two miles
beyond Polo, nine miles from Manila and fifteen miles from
Malolos. Railroad will be repaired to advance point to
morrow and troops supplied by cars. Mac Arthur will
press on to-morrow; is now in open country. Insur
gents stoutly resisting behind succeeding lines of intrench
ments from which the troops continually drive them. City
is perfectly quiet and the native inhabitants appear to be
relieved of anxiety and fear of the insurgents. Captain
Krayenbuhl, Commissary Lieutenant Third Artillery, is mor
tally wounded. OTIS."
from Caloocan despite the strong
sunlight.
By 11 o'clock in the morning
the only building of importance
not destroyed was a large stone
church in the center of the town,
but even at noon fresh fires were
started among the native huts in
the outskirts of Malabon, al
though the general exodus took
place much earlier. Many of the
rebels sought refuge in the sub
urbs Navotas and Casag or were
driven inland by the shells of the
Helena, Callao, Ningdapan and
Laguna de Bai.
In the meantime General
Wheaton's brigade held the rail
road to the river, but was unable
either to repair the bridge, which
had been destroyed by the ene
my, or to advance, owing to the
opposition and the hills on the
other side.
The calculations of both Gen
eral Hale and General Harrison
Gray Otis, whose brigades con
stituted General Mac Arthur's di
vision, were much interfered with
by the character of the country
in front of both, and the enemy
was able to take advantage of
this, so that the operations
against Novalrehs and Polo
were delayed, though the right
wing of the division swung out,
sweeping the enemy in a north
westerly direction.
General Wheaton's headquar
ters last night was half a mile
south of the river on the railroad.
The opposite bank was protected
yesterday by blockhouses and in
trenchments. Occasionally the
artillery and infantry fired across
the stream. Finally the engi

KILLED DURING THE
PROGRESS OF BATTLE

âPrince Loewenstein. formerly
honorary aid-de-camp on the
staff of General Miller at Iloilo,
somehow got in front of the fir
ing line and was killed.
The death of Prince Ludwig
Parl Loewenstein-Wertheim in
yesterday's fighting ends a ca
reer which of late had seemed
mysterious and gives rise to no
little speculation. According to
a dispatch from London to the
Associated Press on March 4, the
Prince, who married Lad* Anne
Saville, daughter of the Earl of
M'-x borough, had 'been lost sight
of by his friends, and an adver
tisement inquiring as to his
whereabouts had appeared in
thf London newspapers.
This elicited a dispatch from
Manila saying that the missing
Prince was in the Philippines,
had been there for many
months, was present at the de
struction of Montejo's fleet and
was a member of the European
Club. The dispatch asserted
also that his behavior had given
rise to a suspicion that he was
acting as the confidential agent
of the German Government. It
was further alleged that before
Manila surrendered he was al
lowed to pass in and out of the
Spanish and insurgent lines,
each party apparently regarding
him as favorable to themselves.
For a few days it was even as
serted that he acted as a volun
tary aid-de-camp on the staff of
Brigadier-General Miller.
The London Daily Mail about
the same time said it had in
formation that Prince Ludwig
was in Iloilo in January of this
year, and with othf>r papers it
asked the meaning of these
"mysterious movements."
neers moved a construction train
up to the bridge, the iron frame
work of which remained, and be-
gan to replace the floor.
While this was going on the
Second Oregon regiment crossed
the river on the left and the
Twenty-second on the right, with
four companies of the Twenty
third Infantry supporting the lat
ter regiment. A rising clear
ground stretched away for a dis
tance of half a mile to Malinta,
situated on its crest.
In front of the village were
strong Filipino intrenchments,
but no Filipinos were to be seen.
Apparently they had fled. The
Twenty-second regiment ap
proached diagonally, with Gen
eral Wheaton and his staff close
behind and scouts closely observ
ing the ground.
When the Americans were
within about 300 yards of the in
trenchments the Filipinos sud
denly volleyed heavily.' The
Twenty-second, which was hold
ing the center, suffered consider
ably, but with the Oregonians on
the left and the Kan sans on the
right in the woods, the fighting
was kept up for half an hour, the
Twenty-second Infantry advanc
ing up the slope through the
thick grass under the hottest fire.
General Wheat on and staff
were all the time under a rain of
bullets. Colonel Egbert, who
was in the thickest of the fight
ing, was shot in the abdomen.
He was placed on a stretcher and
an attempt was made to carry
him to the cars, but he died on
the way.
It was a most affecting scene.
General Wheaton. baring his
head, said: "You have done
nobly." Colonel Egbert gasped
in reply: "I must die; lam too
old."
Xo Filipinos were found in the
trenches. Though apparently
| their force was much smaller
'than that of the Americans, they
had an immense advantage in po
sition and opportunity to retreat.

GENERAL EGBERT
KILLED IN BATTLE
WASHINGTON, March 26.â Colonel Henry C. Egbert, whom General
Otis reports among the killed, was born in Pennsylvania, and ap
pointed a first lieutenant in the army from civil life on Septem
ber 23. 1861. He served continuously as a line officer for nearly
forty years. Hp was more closely identified with the Twelfth In
fantry than any other organization, having served with distinction in that
regiment during the Civil War. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Get
tysburg, but escaped and rejoined his command, and was severely wounded
on June 3, 1864, In the battle of Bethesda Church, Virginia. He was major
of the Seventeenth Infantry from 1890 to 1893, when he became lieutenant
colonel of the Sixth Infantry. This regiment he commanded in the Santiago
campaign until disabled by a shot through the body on July 1, IS9B. For his
distinguished service in battle he was promoted a brigadier general of vol
unteers, which grade he held until December, IS9S, when in the reduction of
the volunteer army he was hrmorably discharged. He was promoted colonel
in the regular establishment on July 1, 1898, and assigned to the Twenty
second Infantry, whose colonel, Charles A. Wikoft", was killed at San Juan
Hill. He joined the Twenty-second Infantry on January 30. 1899, sailed with
it for Manila on February 1, and arrived at Manila on March 4, 1899. Gen
eral Egbert was well known throughout the army as an officer of a high or
der of ability and as a man of sterline Qualities.

MINISTER CONGER
MAY MAKE PROTEST
Instructed to Protect American
flights in Encroachments
at S^aoghai.
â  NEW YORK, March 26.â The Washington correspondent of the
Â± Herald telegraphs: Instructions have just been sent by Secretary Hay
+. to Edwin H. Conger, United States Minister at Peking, directing him
p to protest against any encroachments upon the American concession at
X Shanghai, and to demand for the United States the same privileres or
$_ advantages that may be accorded to any other .ation.
Â© While I have not been able to ascertain that the adrr> ! - ' tration fears
jt any encroachment upon the American settlement, I understand the
5 '. tate Department has received information showing that the English
q and German gove*- ..its have taken steps looking to tV extension of
+. their respective settlements at Shanghai, and as the American conces-
O sion adjoins them it is not proposed to permit them to obtain possession
+ of any portion of it.
O As the American community has grown equally with the British
Sand German, tlie administration believes that it is only due to the United
5 States that China should in case of the extension of the concessions of
Q these nations extend the American boundaries. Minister Conger will.
â *" therefore, sharply watch the situation, and agreement to demands of
$ the British and German 'Ministers will be followed by the submission of
Â© a like demand by the American representatives.
â â¦- It is untrue that the United States Minister is acting jointly with the
Â© British and German representatives in seeking an extension of the for

â¢Â® The United States "Minister will not tct with these diplomats in this

the Twentieth Kansas Regiment,
joined General Wheaton's bri
gade shortly after Malinta was
taken, approaching along the
Novalrehs road westerly.
The soldiers were mucli* ex
hausted and there were several
prostrations from the heat, which
was intense. The dead and
wounded were collected- in the
shade of the trees and carried' on
stretchers by Chinese across "the
river to the train.
After luncheon General Mac-
Arthur's division advanced to
ward Polo.
The Second Oregon Regiment
encountered iooo Filipinos west
of Malinta, who were retreating
from Malabon. The enemy had
taken up a position behind four
rows of intrenchments, but was
driven out after an hour's heavy
firing. One Oregonian was kill
ed and five were wounded.
The Third Artillery, acting as
infantry, with two guns of the
Utah Artillery, and the Kansans
had a sharp fight east of Malinta.
The Americans had but slight
losses. Five Filipinos were fqund
dead and several were taken pris
oners. General Mac Arthur's di
vision is advancing upon Polo
along the railroad. As the bridge
is destroyed and the river cannot
be forded, the advance is tem
porarily checked to-night.
In the fighting west of Malinta
the Oregonians captured a Span
iard, but he denied that he was
taking part in the battle.
The surgeons from the fleet
and the British cruiser Powerful
volunteered their assistance and
were indefatigable in their serv
ices at the front.
POLO FOUND BURNING
AND DESERTED
MANILA, March 27, 11:35 a. m.â The
Americans this morning found the im
portant town of Polo and a number of
small villages west of the railroad de
serted and burning. They are advanc
ing along the railroad.
To-day the Washington Volunteers,
â who held Pasig yesterday, had an en
gagement with a band of insur^n'
who drove in their outposts. In the
fight the Filipinos lost several men.
GUNBOATS SHELL
MALABON AND VICINITY
MANILA, March 27, 7:40 a. m.â The
Helena and the army gunboats shelled
Malabon and the country beyond, while
the Monadnock focussed all its bat
teries upon Paranaque for two hours
for the purpose of destroying the mili
tary stores there. A great smoke wa3
caused, but as the insurgents are In
possession of the town the results of
the shelling are not obtainable.
The evacuation of Malabon was a
picturesque rout. Thousands of men,
women and children, loaded down with
household goods, some with their dear
est treasuresâ fighting cocks â under
their arms, poured across the swamps
in the early morning.
An exploded caisson at the railroad
bridge proved a bar to the Americans.
Ten soldiers of the Oregon regiment,
while searching for two of those killed
earlier in the fighting, sneaked into the
city in the morning and found the place
In a condition of chaos. The inhabi
tants, seeeing them, fled in a panic,
thinking the American forces were in
possession. The Oregonians shot several
armed natives and then returned to
camp.
The American forces did not occupy
Malabon, but are concentrating their
strength to strike Malolos. Malabon is
a city of desolation. The American sol
diers have been forbidden to enter the
place for fear that natives may be
lurking there.
STEADY ADVANCE
OF OUR SOLDIERS
MANILA, March 27, 7:40 a. m.â The
Americans have advanced along the
line of the Dagupan Railroad, driving
the Filipinos from Malinta and New
Canayan, where there were 3000 inhab
itants. Last night the brigade of Gen
eral Harrison G. Otis and General Hale
encamped in the enemy's trenches at
New Canayan, and that of General
Wheaton at Malinta.
General Wheaton's brigade formed a
junction with the remainder of General
Mac Arthur's division at Malinta, and
the latter, leaving General Wheaton
there, marched along the railroad to
New Canayan. This place was forti
fied, and for 300 yards from it there
were trenches on each side of the track.
These were taken possession of by the
American troops. The movement of
the Americans will be pushd in this di
rection.
The Filipinos, realizing that the rail
road is the crucial line, have construct
ed row after row of trenches running
diagonally on both sides of the track
a few hundred yards apart. This
work was designed most intelligently,
and has evidently been done under the
direction of experts. It represnts an
enormous amount of labor. Most of
the rebel positions are protected by
thick earthworks, a majority of them
topped with stones and provided with
loopholes. Some have sheet-iron roofs.
The day's work of the United States
troops consisted of storming the suc
cessive trenches. The Filipinos occu
pying them were completely hidden.
Tho enemy poured a strong fire from
every trench until they were disturbed
by a flanking volley, when they would
disappear into the woods and jungle,
only to make a stand at the next line.
The American loss was remarkably

small, seven being reported killed and
seventeen wounded. It is known the
Filipinos were so protected that they
suffered little. No., dead insurgents
were found in the trenches. Forty
prisoners were taken by the Americans
and it,is estimated that the rebel casu
alties numbered twenty.
The insurgents broke their guns when
they .\rere compelled to abandon them.

NEW YORK, March 26.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: The crushing of Aguln
aldo's northern army is a more difficult
task than the authorities here had an
ticipated. Advices from General Otis
to-day make it clear to " em that con
siderable more fighting must be done
before the supremacy of the United
States is firmly established in the
archipelago.
"As far as the operations of the last
twenty-four hours are concerned the
situation is as satisfactory as could be
expected In view of the great difficul
ties encountered," Adjutant General
Corbin remarked to-night.
The latest dispatch brought the most
favorable news of the day. It showed
that General McArthur has succeeded
in getting north of Polo, though not by
the route that had been desired. Thus
it appears that while General Mac-
Arthur has not been able to cut Aguin
aldo's army in two, there has been a
distinct advance by the American
troops and the enemy is being driven
northward.
Other advices, however, indicate that
the hardest fighting is yet to come. The
intrenchments which the insurgents
have been building for months are re
ported to be much stronger between
Polo and Maloios than anticipated.
General Otis indicates by his dis
patches that the line of the railway will
be followed in further movements to
ward Malolos. With the aid of small
gunboats which will be able to navi
gate some of the small rivers and inlets
tho military experts here do not doubt
the ability of the American forces to
steadily advance along the route of the
railway to Aguinaldo's headquarters.
The news that the railway is to be re
paired to the advance point held by
General Mac Arthur by to-morrow is
regarded of the utmost importance, as
it will enable General Otis to forward
supplies promptly and send forward re
enforcements if necessary.
An important phase of the omcTal
dispatches received to-day is the state
ment that the best of Aguinaldo's
forces are composed of released prison
ers of war of former native Spanish
troops. General Corbin told me to
night that he understood that all the
Spanish prisoners of war had been re
i by Aguinaldo, including Catholic
priests. If this is true it relieves the
United States from a rather embarrass
ing problem.
While late advices from Otis give an
encouraging aspect to the situation, the
authorities appreciate that the war
may be prolonged, and it is the pur
pope of the War Department to hurry
more troops to the assistance of Otis
as rapidly as possible. About 19,000
troops have been under orders for some
days to prepare for service in the Phil
ippines. There are at present 29,600
men in the Philippines and about 5000 en
route, some of which will reach Manila
on the Sheridan to-morrow or next day.
WASHINGTON, March 26.â General
Otis' dispatches received at 10 o'clock
to-night recording Mac Arthur's ad
vance to New Canayan marked a di
rect and important step by the Ameri
can troops in the opinion of Acting
Secretary Meiklejohn and Adjutant
General borbin. Both expressed their
satisfaction at what had been accom
plished. The former dispatch regarding
this branch of the operations had not
been so promising, inasmuch as they
had stated that General Mac Arthur,
though he had riven the enemy, could
not gain a point north of Polo on ac
count of the roughness of the country.
With easy railroad communication to
the advanced point, the difficulty in
forwarding commissary supplies will be
considerably lessened. Every step for
ward is regarded as so much ground
gained, and an approach nearer the in
surgents' headquarters at Malolos, now
stated to be but fifteen miles from the
vanguard of the American army.
The tenacity of the Filipinos in the
past few days' fighting has somewhat
surprised the war officials here, who
did not think them capable of putting
up and maintaining the contest they
have. The Associated Press bulletin
dated at 9:15 the morning of the 27th
was the first news of Monday's fighting
received by the War Department offi
cials, General Otis' dispatch up to that
time having been confined to the pre
vious day's operations. The fact that
the insurgents had been forced to re
tire from Malabon so early in the day
was regarded as very encouraging, and
Acting Secretary Meiklejohn remarked,
"That is good; very favorable, indeed."
Secretary Long said to-night that
nothing had come from Admiral Dewey
during the day respecting the American
operations at Manila.
"Word is hourly expected at the War
Department of the arrival of the trans
port Sheridan at Manila, with 1900 re
inforcements for General Otis. This
will be a formidable addition to his
fighting strength. They Include one
full regiment and headquarters and one
battalion of another, and if the experi
ence of those taken aboard the Grant
and Sheridan Is repeated they will be in
fighting trim as soon as they land and
ready to be pushed immediately to the
front. Six regiments of Infantry
and artillery, comprising approxi
mately 8000 men, one regiment of
which sailed from San Francisco
yesterday, are under orders for
Manila. Their movement will be pasned
as rapidly as possible with a view to
the reinforcement of General Otis at
the earliest day practicable.
ENGLISH ADMIRATION
OF BRAVE AMERICANS
LONDON, March 26.â The Philippine
campaign of late had rather lost inter
est for British readers, but to-day there
is an entire change. All the dispatch
es are printed prominently and at
length. Most of the papers contain edi
torials expressing admiration for the
bravery, of the American troops and
sympathy for them in the â  difficulties
they have encountered. The general
opinion is that the American victories
are not conclusive, since the Filipinos
have not yet learned the lesson of the
hopelessness of resisting the United
States.
The Standard says: "The Americans
are fighting the rebels with a dash and
vigor that are in marked contrast to
the faltering blows aimed at them by
the Spanish generals. Englishmen will
read with sympathy of the successive
charges of the American infantry
across the open Li the face of a heavy
fire. Work such as this has had to be
done times without number in the
course of our own empire-making 1 ."
The Daily Telegraph says: "All the
accounts show that the Americans will
have to bear their full share of the
'White Man's Burden.' The experience
that the United States is gathering to
day is that of every power which has
sought to found an empire beyond its
own shores."
The Daily News says: "The ultimate
result can hardly be doubted, but stra
tegically Manila is still threatened."

Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
ILOILO, March 26.â The transport
Indian has arrived here with rein
forcements for Negros Island, where
the situation is still satisfactory. The
rising of the hill tribes was of no polit
ical significance.
A committee of natives, with Colonel
Smith, the American Governor, presid
ing, proceeded with the work of draft
ing a constitution, taking the Ameri
can constitution as a basis for the
document. It has been formally pro
posed to raise the island's revenue en
tirely from exports instead of the pres
ent method of levying upon land values
and personal property, thus relieving
the laboring classes as far as possible.
The natives desire the immediate In
troduction of the English system of
education.
Deputies for the island of Negros will
meet on April 3to discuss the draft of
the constitution.
The climate here is more favorable
than at Manila. The percentage of
illness among the troops is small.
General Miller will relinquish com
mand at Iloilo to -lorrow. Colonel
David D. Van Valzah will be in com
mand until the arrival of General
Hughes.

AGUINALDO PRETENDS
TO WIN GREAT VICTORIES
MANILA, March 23 (via Hongkong
March 26). â Insurgent papers received
here from Malolos show that Aguinaldo
is endeavoring to deceive his followers
into the belief that they are winning
great victories. All the recent en
gagements are proclaimed as American
defeats. The papers describe the in
surgents meeting with the American
forces at various points, and end their
accounts with the assertion that the
Americans retired to their original lines
after suffering great slaughter.

TWELFTH NEW YORK
RETURNS FROM CUBA
Given an Enthusiastic Welcome on
Its Arrival at the American
Metropolis.
NEW YORK, March 26.â The home-com
ing of the Twelfth New York regiment,
which arrived to-day from Matanzas,
Cuba, on the transport Meade, was
marked by great enthusiasm. There was
so little sickness among the men that
when the vessel reached quarantine, Col
onel K. W. Leonard, who was in com
mand, was able to report "All Well."
The Meade left Matanzas on March 22.
She was in charge of Captain Wilson and
had on board 43 officers and 944 men of
the Twelfth Regiment and a number of
cabin passengers, among them Paymaster
General Carey, who went to Cuba with
the $3,000,000 for the Cuban army; Miss
Carey, his daughter; Miss Rochester, Ma
jor R. L. Rogers of the Paymaster's De
partment, and wife; Captain Millis and
Lieutenant Howell of the Engineer Corps,
and the detail of twenty-two men who
went to Cuba on the Meade to guard the
money to pay the Cuban soldiers; and
General Aveleno Rosas, a division com
mander in the Cuban army. Lieutenant
Clausen of Company F of the Twelfth
Regiment, brought his wife with him. The
bride is a Cuban and speaks only the
Spanish language. It is paid that the
Lle-utenant cannot speak Spanish. They
were married about a week ago.
The regiment landed at the White Star
pier and was met by a great crowd of
people. It was followed by the veterans.
The band struck up "Should Auld Ac
quaintance Be Forgot." The soldiers
passed through Washington Park and up
Fifth avenue to the armory on sixty-sec
ond street. The streets were crowded all
along the route, and Mayor Van Wyck

peared the streets were blocked and dense
throngs were on every side.

His wife lay beside him, shot twice through the head. Corey had drawn

ENDURANCE OF
HIS HOLINESS
Cheerful Underthe Sur
geon's Knife;
RELIEVED OF THE TUMOR
INCIDENTS OF THE IMPORTANT
OPERATION.
The Pope Refused Anesthetics, and
While the Doctors Worked He
Calmly Responded to a
Bishop's Prayer.
Special Dispatch to Thfl Call.
NEW YORK, March 26.â A
special cable to the Journal from
Rome says: In an interview Dr.
Mazzoni said to-da^ the condi
tion of the Pope was very sat
isfying. The Pontiff resumed
his habitual daily work this
morning and celebrated mass.
ROME, March 26.â "Doctor," said
Leo XIII to Lapponi when the latter
informed him that it had been decided
that an operation was necessary, "you
do wrong to separate two friends who
have lived so closely together for thirty
years."
The tumor was situated, on the right
hip. A somewhat too extended walk in
the garden under a hot sun had served
to inflame it and arouse the fears of
the doctor, who on the evening of Feb
ruary 27 simply said to his patient that
he would operate on him the next day,
receiving only the pleasing response
from his Holiness that he knew It.
Lapponi went down to the French
Sisters of Saint Martha and ordered
that they carry up to the apartments
of the Pupe for 8 o'clock the next morn
ing the operating board and the fold
ing bed that had been used recently for
the operation on Cardinal Svampa. Sis
ter Therese, who had just returned the
same day from Naples, did not even at
tempt to make any inquiries, as it
would have been useless In the face of
the mysterious bearing of the doctor,
but she immediately concluded that a
serious affair would take place on the
morrow in the Pope's rooms. She was
convinced of it when, as she accompa
nied the needed articles to the ante
chamber, she heard one of the Popes
secretaries say to her: "Offer your holy
communion this morning for the wel
fare of the Holy Father, for he will
have much need of your prayers."
When S o'clock sounded Dr. Lapponi
brought the Surgeon Mazzoni to the
apartments of the Pope Leo still slept
auietly and they decided to wait until
he waked in the meantime preparing
the operating instruments and the bed.
Three-quarters of an hour later the
Holy Father awoke and permitted the
visitors to enter. ,
"Holy Father," said Lappom to him,
''^amt^'replied Leo XIII. The
Pope only asked him if he still be
lieved the operation to be necessary,
and on Lapponi's replying that it was,
he turned to Mazzoni and said to him
quietly "Professor, go on! But per
mit me to request of you two things,
the first not to make me suffer too
much, and the second, to work auick
ly for I have much to do."
* When the patient was installed on
the board, at the will of the surgeon,
he refused any kind of anesthetic
which would make him sleep during
the operation.
After talking some moments with
Bishop Pifferi, his confessor in ordi
nary he asked that he would call his
private secretary, Bishop Angeli.
"Angeli! Are you there? You will
say the mass 'Pro infirmis' in my pres
ence. Make an altar on the table and
commune."
"But I have already said my mass
this morning, Holy Father."
"Well, begin again."
"But I have broken my fast with a
cup of milk."
"I relieve you of that. Say the mass
for the sick, and now, gentlemen, pro
ceed." . , . .
Whiter than the vestment which he
had put on the priest commenced the
"in nomine Patris," and the surgeon at
the same time entered upon his work.
To extract the tumor, as large as an
orange, down to the roots of the fibers
the scalpel had to fo with a deep cut
and concentrically. A long sigh, imme
diately suppressed, by the sufferer an
nounced the commencemei.t of the
work. And until the "elevation" one
heard nothing but the prayers of the
priest, to which the patient tried to re
spond. When the little bell announced
the consecration of the cup and of the
wafer the suffering of the godly old
man was greater than his fortitude and
Leo began to complain. Long sighs, in
terrupted by sharp exclamations, came
from the operating board, where one
saw but little between the cloths spong
ing the wound except blood.
How did Mgr. Angeli finish this sor
rowful /nass standing between the
blood of the Christ which he conse
crated and the blood of his Vicar, which
filled the chamber with a sharp odor,
and thick stains?
"T was ignorant of it," said he after
ward, "and here is a mass unconscious
ly repeated, for which the congreation
of rlies can give me absolution."
The operation lasted three long quar
ters of an hour, when Dr. Mazzoni,
having bound up the gaping- wound, an
nounced that all was happily finished.
They lifted from the board the Pope,
who had not lost his spirits for an in
stant, and carried him to his usual bed,
where, dozing off this time immediate
ly, he slept a long sleep.
He was quite lively on awakening,
and asked to see once more his pain
ful traveling companion, and promised
to make on this tumor of which they
had so harshly deprived him some
Latin verses. He rested well during
the five successive days, after which
the doctors, enchanted with the condi
tion of the convalescent, issued no
more bulletins of health, thenceforth
useless for an old man who was per
fectly on his feet again. Too soon even,
for Leo XIII, impatient to resume hi 3
daily occupations, had not waited for
the written permission of the faculty,
who found him the very morning after
the operation standing up and at work
by the default of the sick nurses, whose
vigilance the acuteness of the conval
escent had evaded. And after passing
through the experience of the operat
ing board, this nonogenarian, once
more at his worktable, thinks more of
his Cardinals who are sick than of his
own sufferings, for the same morning
he sent his Eminence Ledowski a small
box of dolci, the bonbons which he pre
fers, to cure him of a cold more obsti
nate than his own ills.
"Oh! my own, I know how to take
care of them. Wait a moment." said
he tn the amazed Mazzoni. "and hear
the Latin verses which I promised
you." __^_^______

vailed, although it is doubtful if the
c ture would have been effected ex
cept for the fact that th Zeltners were
nearly out of ammunition, and they
knew surrender was the only way of
saving themselves from an infuriated
mob.
The militia had planned to make a
stand about daylight, and strict picket
duty was maintained by the Bloom
dale Ritles all night, the men belne sta
tioned around the house to prevent the
Zeltner picking the men off. There
were several narrow escapes from bul

in demanding the papers, and imme
diately fired the fatal shot that killed
Westenhaver.
As the Zeltners had their horses ready
for mounting and escape, it is thought
that they had arranged to get Westen

"doing" him, although they did not
give the victim time to make any dem

shooting oil tanks when they are on
fire and a quantity of nitro-glycerine
had been secured, so that there would
have been trouble after sunrise if the
troops had not arrived.
The Zeltner brothers and their fami
lies were no douht saved by the prompt
arrival of troops under the orders of
Governor Bushnell. The troops stood
between the tiring from the house and
the enraged crowds, and not only cap
tured the desperadoes, but also pro
tected them from violence all the way
from the south boundary of this county
to the jail here, a distance of over
twenty miles, with excitement at the
highest pitch all along the route.
In connection with the participation
of the two women and four children
in the Zeltner barricaded house, it is
stated as further proof of deliberation
that the Zeltners transferred their
farms and other property to Fnda> to
Mrs John Zeltner.
Ex-Sheriff Briggs told the following
interesting story: â.
â¢I will acknowledge." he said, that
I had some misgivings when I heard
the men unbolt the door, and as I
stepped into the house both men had
their rifles in their hands and the door
was banged behind me like a flash.
Empty shells and cartridges were
strewn about the floor and a smell of
sulphur prevailed. John's wife was
weeping, and the two little children
were huddled about her knees. I said:
â¢Now boys, if you have it in for me,
just give me a chance" it Is all I ask.
I finally persuaded them to lay asid<>
their guns. They both appeared to be
badly scared, but did not seem to real
ize the seriousness of their situation."
Late to-night the elder brother, Paul,
said: "I am glad I killed him" (mean
ing Westenhaven).
This is all he would say. John re
fused to say anything.
The town is quiet to-night, and while
there has been some talk on the street
nothing has been or will be done. The
whole afternoon and early part of the
evening the jail was crowded by visit
ors, who were permitted to see the pris
oners.

Skaguay, brings Important advices. A
United States inspector conveying a lot
of packages of liquor was stopped at
the White Pass summit on March 20 by
the Canadian police. The liquor was

when they arbitrarily refused to allow
American convoys in charge of liquor
to pass. The American deputy collector
submitted the matter to the authorities
at Washington.

OUTLAW MURPHY PLANNED
THE ANGELS STAGE HOLD-UP
ANGELS CAMP, March 26.â An the
attempted hold-up of the Angels-
Valley Springs stage on Friday
night Is talked of, many actions of
Robert Murphy during his resi
dence here are recalled and show his
naturally vicious character. Living in
a cabin In a secluded spot with a part
ner who was completely under his In
fluence, he concocted many schemes by
which he gave play to his criminal in
stincts. Peddlers making periodical
trips were accustomed to stop over
night at the Selkirk place, near which
Murphy's cabin stood, leaving their
wagons laden with merchandise un
guarded. On numerous occasions these
wagons were pilfered. On searching the
cabin-rafter the desperado's latest es
capade a quantity of stolen articles was
recovered and identified by the rightful
owners. The carcass of a goat was
found prepared for use as food. Fred
Antolla identified the hide of the ani
mal, which was in the cabin, as that of
a goat which disappeared from his
place a few days ago.
Both Murphy and Westfall were seen
in town but a few hours previous to
the attack on the stage, and the form
er's nervous appearance was noted by
several persons. He purchased a bottle
of wine and they returned to the cabin,
where Murphy evidently plied his

HAVANA. March 26. â Secretary
Alger and his party arrived here this
afternoon on the United States
transport Ingalls, after having lost
their way at sea for several
hours. It seems that the Inealls
was m:':ing very good time yes
terday and was likely to make Havana
last night if she kept on a straight
course. General Alger suggested wait
ing a while at Key West and leaving
there in time to reach Havana at 9
o'clock this morning. The Inealls put
into Key West, and General Aleer
wired C-neral Brooke to expect him
about 9 o'clock to-day.
The Ingalls left Key West at 11
o'clocl: last night, and the whole party
was up for an early breakfast this
morning, after which all went on deck
to wait for El Morro to loom up. Nine
o'clock came, but there was no sign of
the castle. General Alger, getting a
little impatient, sent to the pilot house
to inquire when Havan;. would be
reached. The reply was. "In about an
hour." An hour and a half passed with
the Cuban coast on the left and Ha
vana was still unsighted. Toward
noon the roofs of a city could be made
out, and General Alger, calling for a
glass, took a close look.
â¢Why that is Matanzas," he said,
and just then the Ingallfe began to
turn around. The navigating officer
was all out in his calculations. He

outside the harbor for another look. At
3 o'clock they saw the smoke of a
steamer going down the coast, but as
it was in the direction opposite to that
from which they expected the Ingalls
they had no Suspicion that it was the
transport, and therefore returned to
La Ma china wharf.
But the Ingalls it was. and in due
time she entered the harbor, but with
out the arrangod reception. Shortly
after hmvfver, the generals went on
board and had a brief conference with
the Secretary, who arranged to meet
them again to-morrow morning at the
Hotel Trocha, Governor General
Brooke's headquarters at El Vedado.
General Aleer did not land, saying
that he preferred to remain on board
the transport. He expects to stay here
two days at least and he may go to
Plnar del Rio. The Tip to Clenfuegos
will be made overland, the transport
poing around the west end of the
Island so as to be able to take the
Secretary from Clenfuegos to Santiago.
General Alger says his trip is partly
for rest and partly for purposes of in
spection. He desires to get informa

A commission recently appointed to in
vestigate the subject met at Yokohama
on March 6.
A bill has been introduced in the Jap
anese House of Representatives grant
ing special navigation subsidies for a
period of ten years to steamship lines
plying between Japan, Europe, Seattle
and San Francisco. The European line
is to receive annually 2,673,894 yen, the
Seattle line 654,030 yen, the San Fran

By royal decree the Empress Dowager
of China has restored to Jung Lv,
Grand Secretary, all his honors. Che

Sung Kuang, Controller of Household,
has been restored to favor and all his
honors and titles handed back to him,
and Wai Teh, the Censor, is now per
mitted to wear his peacock feather.
These restorations were unexpected,
and are causing much comment in Chi
nese political circles.
Strenuous efforts are being put forth
for the suppression of piracy on the
Canton and West rivers, which of late
has grown to immense proportions.
The Viceroy has sent several old Ger

ping, and has threatened the captains
of guard boats with degradation on
account of their lack of vigilance.
A strike of coolies employed in coal

much inconvenience to shipping, and
a large number of steamers are now
anchored In that port awaiting the end
of the strike so they can take on coal.
The strike was the result of an attempt
to reduce wages.
COMTE CHAUDERDY
CALLED BY DEATH
Passing of the Noted French Dip
lomatist and Writer at
Paris.
PARIS, March 26.â Comte Alexandra j
Damaze de Chauderdy, the celebrated
French diplomatist, died to-day.
Comte Chauderdy, who was born In 1526,
entered diplomacy In ISSI as an attache of
the French embassy in Rome. Five years
later he was appointed secretary of the
embassy. He held similar posts in the
six years which followed, at Weimar, j
Madrid, Copenhagen and Carlsruhe, in |
the order named, after which he entered i
the French Cabinet in 1862 as Under Sec
retary. In 1868 he went as French Min
ister Plenipotentiary to Madrid.
Three years later, as a representative I
of the French Foreign Office, he publish- j
ed a series of remarkable circulars in re- i
sponse to notes addressed to the powers
by Bismarck, refuting the accusations of I
the Federal Chancellor respecting alleged
violations by France of the Geneva con
vention. He protested at the same time i
with great energy against the excesses
committed In France by the German
troops.
After two years in the Chamber of
Deputies as a representative of Lot-et-
Garonne. He was appointed French Em
bassador to the Swiss Confederation, be
ing transferred about nine months later |
to Madrid. In ISSI M. Gambetta nomi- |
nated him French Embassador to Russia, j
but he did not have time to proceed to
St Petersburg before the Gambetta Mm- !
istry fell. . '
Comte Chauderdy was made a' com
mander of the Legion of Honor in 1876.
He published several works, among them
"The Political Status of the French Na
tion " "France Following the War of
1870-71" and "France in 1578."

Suicide on an Ocean Liner.
NEW YORK. March 26.â William Scott, |
a corn merchant of Liverpool, England, j
50 years of age, committed suicide on the j
steamer T'mbria while she was en route
'to this country. He was found on the
morning of March 24 in his stateroom with
his throat cut. He had inflicted the
wound with a broken bpttle. J
ended so disastrously to them. West
fall was in trouble over the stealing of
a case of whisky while teaming for a
grocer last year. He was as clay in
Murphy's hands, and is undoubtedly
feeble-minded. He grins in an idiotic
manner when addressed.
Boths youths are held under $5000
bonds. Murphy will probably die, as
two ribs were practically shot out and
he is internally injured. He was re
moved to the County Hospital to-day.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA. March 26.â
The United States cruiser New
York and the gunboats Vicks
burg and Annapolis arrived here
this morning. Rear Admiral Sampson,
accompanied by Captain F. E. Chad
wick of the cruiser, called upon Major
General JLeonard Wood, the military
Governor, a salute being fired in honor
of the admiral. This afternoon General
Wood returned the visit. There were
further complimentary salutes, and
the war ships left this evening for
Kingston, Jamaica.
During the day Admiral Sampson vis
ited Morro Castle, never having ex
plored the interior before. With regard
to the discovery of the remains of a
Spanish officer in an armchair on the
beach west of Morro, the admiral ex
pressed his opinion that they were cer
tainly the remains of Admiral Villami!.
Five more bandits have been cap
tured and two others killed. The cit
izens express satisfaction at the cap
ture of Mattamoras and Trucen, well
known brigands, and it is thought that
with their capture the backbone of
brigandage in this district is broken.
General Wood's March estimate has
finally been approved by the authori
ties at Havana, and consequently those
who have been unemployed are able to
resume work, relieving the strain.
KINGSTON, Jamaica, March 26.â
Rear Admiral Sampson's squadron ar
rived here to-day from Santiago de
Cuba. Crowds gathered along the
shores, cheating enthusiastically, and
all the shipping in the harbor was be
fiagged. The various public buildings
were decorated with the entwined
union jack and stars and stripes.
Guards of honor have been ordered to
receive the American admiral to-mor
row. A long series of entertainments
for the officers of the squadron is being
arranged, and the Governor's and
naval annual receptions have been
postponed in order to fall within the
period of Admiral Sampson's stay.
PRESIDENT MAY NAME
A SECOND ADMIRAL
Mistake of Congress Gives Him the
Authority to Promote Another
Naval Officer.
NEW YORK, March 26.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the fol
lowing: Unwittingly Congress, just be
fore its adjournment, gave President Mc-
Klnley authority to appoint two admirals
of the navy Instead of limiting the grade
to one, as it undoubtedly Intended. Presi
dent McKinley approved on March 2 "an
act creating the office of admiral of the
navy " providing "that the President is
hereby authorized to appoint by selec
tion and promotion an admiral of the
navy."
A certified copy of the act was present
ed to Secretary I^ng by the State De
partment and the former immediately
made out the nomination of George
Dewey to be admiral. The nomination
was confirmed by the Senate on March 3.
Notwithstanding the Prfsident had ap
pointed an officer to be "an admiral of
the navy," as provided for in the act,
Congress passed the navy appropriation
bill, which was approved lato on the leg
islative day of March 3, containing a pro
vision identical in language with the act
und.T which Admiral Dewey had been
appointed and confirmed.
It has been pointed out that the provi
sion, like the act, provided for the ap
pointment of an officer to he an admiral
"by seLection and promotion."

companions seriously wounded at Edge
field by four white employes of the Edge
field Cotton Factory. Two of the mur
derers are mere boys, probably not over

fired. It isTiifficult to fix the motive for
the crime, but it is supposed the shots
which killed the negroes were intended
for others.

FOUND DEAD IN
A BUTTE HOTEL
Bank of England Forger Sur
vives His Brother but a
Few Days.
BUTTE, Mont.. March 26.â George
Bidwell and Austin Bidwell of Bank of
England forgery fame, came here about
a month ago. On March 7 Austin Bid
well, the younger of the two brothers,
died of griD in his room in the Mantle
block. The body has been in charge of
an undertaker ever since, awaiting ad
vices from relatives. A few days ago
George Bidwell took to his bed with a
severe cold which developed rapidly
into pneumonia. Some time during last
night he died in his room in the Butte
Hotel. Xo one was with him at the
time, as he had told his attendant he
needed nobody. He was found dead
when his room was opened this morn
ing.
The famous Bank of England forger
ies were committed in 1573. The Bid
wells, by means of forged securities,
got $5,000,000 from the Bank of Eng
land. Previously they had victimized
other European concerns by means of
forged letters of credit. It was their
intention to obtain $50,000,000 by fraud
and then compromise with the bank.
Austin Bidwell succeeded in disposing
of $50,000 in stolen bonds on a commis
sion in London. Success in this ven
ture emboldened him to attempt a
greater crime. The story of the affair
is told in BidwelTs reminiscences as fol
lows:
Finding myself in London in 1572 with
a very clever partner and about $100.m)0
in our pockets, we resolved to tackle the
Bank of England, believing that the lisht
nlng ought to strike where the balances
are heavy. We figured the matter out to
our satisfaction that the Bank was a fos
sil institution and specially open to at
tack if one had that very rare combina

Associated Press just before he left Ha- i

Washington after the close of office hours
vice President Hobart has decided to ~o j
north with the President. He has not been
feeling as well the last three or four days
as during the early part of his visit and
believes a cooler and more bracing climate
will prove beneficial. His attack of grip
last winter was very severe, and it will
take time and the best of care to rid his
system of its effects. He caught a fresh
cold Wednesday night and this, with some
stomach trouble, made it necessary for
him to keep quiet and observe h.s doc- ,

"KID" McCOY MAY
NEVER FIGHT AGAIN
KID" McCOT. the famous fighter, may never enter a ring contest again.
Up "has made tho startling announcement that he will temporarily re
tire from the fighting business. In the face of the many engagements
that have been booked for him this news will have a chilling effect
on hi? many admirers.
His decision Is due to an examination made by an Eastern physician yes
terday in whose diagnosis McCoy has seen fit to place implicit confidence.
The fact that the pugilist who is fast climbing to the highest notch in his
calling is about to take a rest comes as much a surprise to him as to the
world Yesterday he met his medical friend, who stated to the fighter that
he had witnessed his recent San Francisco battle as well as his New "iork
fight with Sharkey and had become convinced that McCoy was in bad condi
tion physically. He urged that he be permitted to make a thorough exami
nation, and this request being granted the two retired to a room in the Occi
dental' Hotel, where the diagnosis was made.
Hardly had the doctor commenced when he perceived signs of heart fail
ure and advised that McCoy take a vacation in the mountains and a rest,
free from any physical exertion. McCoy accepted the advice and the an
nouncement was a "genuine shock to his friends when he returned to them a
little while later. , _. ,
McCoy will cancel his engagement with Tommie Ryan and Sharkey.
AlÂ«o dates which he has made for exhibitions. The day for his departure
from the city is not stated, but he says it will be soon and that he will re
main in the northern part of the State at least four months.

termined to so to the front myself. With
in a few days I not only had an account
opened with thp bank, but a fairly good
credit established, and all this under a
fictitious name. Within a few months I
had borrowed nearly $5,000,000 from the
bank on collateral and printed my own
collateral.
I left England, believing the world was
mine, and settled down in the West In
dies. I settled my scheme in life and set
out to enjoy myself . not in an intemperate
way. I had no fear of the English police.
as I knew th*> English have an ordinate
idea of the ability of their own police, and
I never counted" on their employing the
Ann rican ftoliee after their own had failed
to locate me. Unluckily for myself, I was
mistaken. John Bull had his back up and
determined to have me in his clutches, no
matter what it cost: so after the English
police failed. to find me the bank employed
the Pinkertons. with orders to spare no
expense. The Pinkertnns put twenty of
the best men on the case and soon let day

In the end I was arrested in my own
house, taken to London and faced an
English Jury In the famous old Bailey

to pay justice her due. and felt that I had
no right to protest, if I should receive a

when the Judge, Lord Archibald, hurled

I fdt that justice was weighing me in her

WAY.
Recovers Consciousness at the Re
ceiving Hospital Long Enough
to Tell His Name.
A man was brought to the Harbor Hos
pital yesterday afternoon from the corner
of Pacific street and Bartlett alley. He
was intoxicated and attempting to ascend
the steep stairway of a Chinese house,
fell to the sidewalk, where he lay help
less till the arrival of the ambulance. At
the hospital it was found that his skull
was fractured and he was unconscious
from his injury. During the evening he
recovered his senses for a moment and
told the physician that his name was Ru
dolph Howard. He quickly passed into
unconsciousness and nothing more could
be learned concerning him. Nothing is
known of him where he was found, and it
is probable that he is a stranger in the
neighborhood. He is about 35 years old
and a laborer, judging from his appear
ance. At a late hour he was alive, but
there is little hope of his recovery.

THE FIGHTING IN THE PHILIPPINE.
rROM ".ate reports it appears the American
force? at Manila have determined upon taking
a vigorous course against the insurgents, so as
to put an end to the disturbances in the island of
Luzon and breaking the power of Aguinaldo. Such
at any rate seems to have been the intent of the ad
vance movement which began on Saturday and
brought on the heaviest fighting which has thus far
occurred during the campaign.
Judging of the situation from this distance, it ap
pears that such a course is the wisest that can be
pursued. The longer the insurgents can harass and
insult our lines and escape with comparative im
punity the more cunning will they become in the
work, and the more dangerous. Moreover, the sum
mer is coming on, bringing about the season when
under the heats of an equatorial sun and amid the
jungles of the tropics an aggressive campaign on the
part of unacclimated troops will be almost impossible.
Very little glory is to be won from the contest,
and yet it will be one that will try both the courage
and the stamina of our soldiers to the utmost. The
course of the fighting thus far has shown what the
tactics of the enemy are to be, and what difficulties
are to be overcome. The Filipinos, it is said, never
except at Malabon permitted the Americans to get
near them or in sight of them. They would fire a few
volleys from ambush, and then scuttle back to an
u;her cover, repeating the tactics for miles. When
oar troops had taken possession of the first position
of the insurgents it was found that many of the ;
trenches had gullies and connecting paths through ;
the cane and brush enabling the insurgents to ad
vance or retreat unseen.
In the victory accomplished on Saturday against !
these obstacles there was displayed every quality j
that makes the American soldier honored at home
and feared abroad. To drive the insurgents from
their entrenchments the Americans had to make a
long advance across open ground, in the face of a
heavy fire, penetrate jungles, cross swamps, swim
rivers, attack fortified posts and pursue an unseen
enemy that fought and fled with an incessant activity.
The aim of the Americans is of course to drive the
Filipinos from their coverts around Manila back to
the wildest recesses of the islands where they may
seek refuge, and then and there strike a blow which,
by crushing the insurrection in Luzon, will dis
courage the leaders in other islands and thus pre
pare the way for a speed)' establishment throughout
the archipelago of a degree of order such as they
have never known before in all their history.
What has been accomplished by the valor of our
troops will be regarded with a true patriotic appre
ciation by the country at large, and yet as the dreary
roll increases that gives the names of those brave
and loyal young Americans who have perished in
battle or in the hospitals, from wounds or from the
pestilential vapors of the swamps and jungles, the
common-sense of the nation will consider more seri
ously than ever whether it is worth while to sacrifice
so many valuable lives for the sake of the sentimental
glory of an imperial policy.
A New York writer sneers at those other writers
who allude to burned hotels as "fire traps," and says
they should have done this in advance of the con
flagration. Unfortunately the newspaper reporter is
not blessed with the gift of prophecy, nor does he
have power to look through a brick wall and discern
that it is merely a veneer for a framework of lath.
However, the Baldwin, late of this city and now of
not blessed memory, had been declared so often to
be a firetrap that 'knowledge of its condition ceased to
interest anybody until the match was applied to the
stiucture.
â  Guests at a recent dinner in New York are said to
have represented two billions and a half of dollars,
and there were fewer of them than might constitute
a grangers' picnic. There was also more dyspepsia
about that board than would be found at the other
gathering.
Many raw soldiers are in the city now. and some
good Samaritan ought to send emissaries to the Bar
bary Coast to warn the strangers against the knock
out drops and the Chinese gin. These agencies
brought many of last summer's volunteers to grief.
Governor Roosevelt probably made his few brief re
marks under oath with full knowledge that the War
Department would have been pleased to have him
say something else. At times, when truth seems to
require it, Roosevelt is actually inconsiderate.
Cosper explains that he went into the Burns camp
so as to break the deadlock. Evidently, however, he
had failed to provide himself with the combination.
Water-front politics operate swiftly enough to sur
prise any new Governor.
INTELLECTUAL DEMOCRACY.
THE anniversary address before the faculty and
the students at the State University, delivered
at Berkeley on Thursday last by President Har
per of the Chicago University, was a thoughtful,
scholarly and earnest exposition of the historical re
lation of university training to the development of
man. He traced that relation back to its origin and
through its successive phases down to the present
century, and enforced with great power the central
thought of his address, that the university had been
the source of that democracy rapidly pervading the
world, which he justly pronounced "the highest ideal
of human achievement; the only possibility of a true
n.itional life."
It was not within President Harper's purpose to
discuss the fundamental cause of the controlling part
taken by the universities in human progress. He
proved and illustrated the fact with a definiteness and
with a completeness that could not be surpassed. But
underlying the fact is one ol the imperishable truths
that demonstrates the falsity of pessimism and ex
plains the growth of civilization. The freest thing on
the earth is intellect. It may be restrained, warped or
hampered in its expression, but it cannot be per
manently suppressed. From the beginning of history
under all forms of government intellectual power has
constantly wrought for liberty, or, more precisely, for
the democracy meant by President Harper, which is
simply liberty voluntarily restrained for the common
good at the point where otherwise it would degener
ate into license.
In both ancient and modern times this democracy
of intellect has been the undying foe of despotism and
of corruption. It is for this reason that despotism
and corruption within themselves or within the range
of their operation and influence contain the seeds of
their own destruction. Mind is too restless and too
aspiring to work in chains. It may imitate servility
and apparently submit to the humiliation of purchase,
but it will not stay bought. This is why even in our
own country low politics submerges intelligence and
the debauchees of party, while they control, reduce
the standard of officialism to their own level. This
incontrovertible truth was strikingly illustrated during
the recent Senatorial deadlock in this State.
Universities originate in the aspirations of intellect,
and are points for its concentration, its discipline, its
training and its effective struggles for emancipation.
The Egyptian priests lived above the ignorance of the
people and modified the tyranny of the Pharoahs. The
schools of Athens set loose on the globe the forces
of independent thought that blended with the Deistic
fervor of the Hebrews, leavened the hard rationalism
cf Rome and dug channels for the fraternity of the
Christian era. This combined inheritance descended
to the universities of Europe, which indeed it largely
created, and filled them through the darkest ages with
embalmed karning and with struggling thought.
Thus was the world prepared for the intense move
ments of the Middle Ages, which in modern times, and
especially in this century, have carried man forward
toward the perception and the enforcement of his own
sovereignty.
It was on this continent and through the painful
gestation, birth and growth of this Republic that the
democracy of intellect at last burst into the full splen
dor of constitutional liberty and threw off every'
shackle of bigotry and of tyranny. It is in this country
therefore that the university shouM reach its highest
and its most democratic influence and power. From
the Atlantic to the Pacific in magnificent institutions,
exemplified at Chicago, at Palo Alto, at Berkeley, the
grandest standards of citizenship and of manhood
have been raised, and such men as Jordan, Harper
and Kellogg, wi*h their associates, some of them
equally conspicuous, are training young men who are
to grasp the opportunities and the problems of the
Twentieth Century, into the practical comprehension
of that Americanism which includes all that is best for
humanity in the past, the present and the future, and
which, unless enervated by internal disease or stifled
within the armor of revived imperialism, will fulfill the
loftiest anticipations of manifest destiny.
A FEW SIGNS IN THE SKY.
TRADE conditions are conflicting and per
plexing at the moment. For several weeks the
leading commercial and financial authorities of
the Government and Wall street have been calling at
tention to the gradual change which is taking place
in the relative positions of the export and import
movements of the country. They have pointed out
that whereas for a year or two our exports have
greatly overbalanced our imports, thereby establish
ing an immense trade balance in favor of the United
States, this condition is now being reversed and the
imports and exports are coming closer together.
Our exports are not materially smaller, but our im
ports are rapidly increasing, and it is feared they will
soon overtake the exports, thus destroying that
boasted balance of trade in our favor. This new
phase of business is not considered alarming, but is
thought to be due to the fact that our unprecedented
prosperity has made us extravagant in the direction
of buying a lot of luxuries from Europe, which has
swelled the national imports. The leading financiers
have been looking askance at this turning of the
tables and wondering how it will turn out.
But in the very face of all this comes the record
of an enormous increase in general trade throughout
the country. The bank clearings last week showed
a clear gain of 73.4 per cent over the same week last
year, the increase at New York being 100.6 per cent,
at Baltimore 129.2 per cent, and so on. These figures
are simply amazing, and as far as the clearings are
an indication of the state of trade there is a remark
able gain in business throughout the whole country.
This condition completely nullifies the unfavorable
aspect of the increase in imports and tends to be
fuddle those clearsighted financiers from whom we
take our cue in our business ventures.
Wall street spent the major portion of the week
pondering over the contradictory conditions con
tained in the above two paragraphs and guessed at
all sorts of explanations without definite results. A
hardening and subsequent softening of the money
market added to the general obfuscation, but the
latter factor proved dominant, the bulls regained
courage and the week closed buoyant at stronger
prices.
From our distant point of view the situation seems
clear enough. Our great prosperity has made us
flush and we are purchasing heavily abroad. Whether
we will overdo it remains to be seen. Certainly our
commerce, domestic and foreign, is immense and
shows no signs of diminution. The leading staples
show no particular change from previous conditions,
except a weakening in the minor metals, due to a re
action in London speculation. The iron and steel
trades continue to report mills overcrowded with
orders. Raw cotton and wool are weaker, wheat; has
been firmer during the past few days and lumber con
tinues to advance. Otherwise the general situation is
without feature.
In the local market, however, there are two new
features of great interest. One is the remarkable
rain, which has effectually laid the dry season specter
and practically assured one of the heaviest harvests
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1599.
in the history of the State. The other is the sudden
activity in the higher levels of commerce. Whether
our conquests in the Orient have had anything to do
with it is a question, but certainly San Francisco is
on the eve of broad and profitable expansion as a
commercial center. New trans-Pacific steamer lines I
are being established, new overland rail connections
being made, and there are rumors of vast financial
operations of a foreign character in the near future.
The destiny so long promised San Francisco as one j
of the half dozen conspicuous ports of the world i
seems on the point of realization. It now begins to j
look as if we are really one of the great gateways of
the world. It is significant in this connection that
finance and not commerce, money and not goods, is
the mainspring of this new expansion. Capital from
all over the world has during the past few months
marked San Francisco as a seat of interoceanic
operations, and the profound observer sees in the
developments of to-day the beginning of that em
pire which will make San Francisco the great
entrepot of the Orient. The start has at last been
made, and from now on our progress will be rapid.
The signs are in the sky.
DEFECT IN REFORM LOGIC.
THE remarks of a morning contemporary con
cerning the Rickard bill, which provides for the
arrangement of party tickets separately upon the
official ballot, would perhaps apply if the Stratton pri
mary law had not been passed. The latter statute pro
poses to purify the very fountainhead of the electoral
system. If the people attend primary elections and
vote, every nominating convention hereafter assem
bled will be thoroughly representative; that is, it
will be composed of delegates selected by the people
themselves. Such being the case, what sense is there
in allowing "side shows," non-partisan committees
and "piece" clubs the privilege of foisting upon ballots
a large number of names designed -merely to take
votes away from the people's candidates?
The newspaper to whose criticisms we are now di
recting attention advocated the enactment of the Strat
ton primary law with warmth and vigor. To the best of
our recollection it claimed that in the event of its
becoming a law the bosses would be speedily over
thrown and the people placed in control of the nomi
nating machinery of all political parties.
We doubt whether these anticipations will be
realized, but if there is any foundation for the Strat
ton primary law at all there is no foundation for the
adverse criticism which is now being heaped upon the
Rickard bill. Nearly every citizen is either a Repub
lican or a Democrat. The few Populists, Non-Par
tisans, soreheads and anarchists who exist cut little or
no figure at national elections. The Republicans and
Democrats run the country because they outnumber
all other partisans ten or fifteen to one. If, there
fore, the new primary law is going to produce pure
conventions, thoroughly representative of these two
party organizations, why should the names of candi
dates appear upon the Australian ballot alphabetically
instead of in party columns?
We think, moreover, that the alphabetical system is
a delusion and snare. A number of first-class can
didates have been defeated in this city for School Di
rectors and Freeholders for no other reason than that
th.cir names commenced with T and W. The party
column system is better than the alphabetical system,
and with the new primary law in force we think all
objection to the Rickard bill is obviated. If this is
not true a screw is loose in somebody's logic, or,
what is worse, the Stratton law is a device of the
bosses to appease the public desire for electoral re
form, under which they will conquer the people and
dictate the character of their office-holders.
A CLfllM ON HUMANITY.
WITH the return of sunshine after the rain the
inmates of the Pesthouse will have relief from
the discomfort of the storm. The pools of
water that, dripping from the leaking roof formed in
almost every apartment of the building, can now be
mopped away and the home of the patients made
once more comparatively dry and warm.
Such relief as nature has thus given does not in
any way, however, relieve the city and its people
from the claim which the pest-stricken patients have
upon them. The issue is one of justice as well as of
charity. Indeed, it appeals in the name of every
law to which humanity recognizes its responsibility.
The victims of pestilential diseases are not crimi
nals, and yet for its own protection society must
shut them away as carefully as it shuts away the
most hardened felon. It is, therefore, incumbent
upon society to make the exclusion of the afflicted
sufferer as comfortable as possible. The Pesthouse
should be an asylum and not a dungeon. It should
be light and airy and warm, and not gloomy and
dank and cold. It should manifest helpfulness and
not punishment â the love and not the wrath of so
ciety.
While neither our law nor our religion regards
the pest-stricken victim as an offender against either
man or God, yet in this city he is treated worse than
any criminal. Our jail is better in every way than
â¢ the home we provide for such a victim and to which
our law sentences him as soon as his malady is dis
covered.
A dilapidated structure, carelessly built for tem
porary use years ago and now fallen into decay, so
weak that its walls cannot stand without the support
of props and so badly roofed that the rains penetrate
every room â such a building if used by the Russians
to house sick convicts would rouse the indignation
of every one who read of it. What, then, shall we say
of it when used by the people of an American com
munity to shelter those whose only offending is pov
erty and affliction?
The wrong has been possible in San Francisco only
because it has not been known. It is one of the evils
that proceed from want of thought rather than want
of heart. Its isolation prevented the general public
from noting its condition, and the exclusion o
visitors from plague-stricken halls forbade even
charity from seeking it out.
Only when the recent rains beat upon the city
bringing so much of cheer and gladness to the com
munity at large, the sad plight of the inmates of the
house led one of them to appeal to The Call. The re
sult was the investigation which disclosed the facts we
have laid before the public. Hereafter there remains
for our officials not even the poor excuse of ignor
ance concerning the degree of the wrong.
Whatever work of reform and improvement may
have to be set aside to make way for it, the construc
tion of a new and better Pesthouse is now the im
mediate duty of the city.
Advocates of universal peace want an immediate
armistice declared in the Philippines. They better
put a white rag on a pole and tell Aguinaldo how they
feel.
San Francisco ought to be proud. It has managed
to pay its teachers part of the sum swiped from
them. '
If. the Burns touts are forced to join the army of
unemployed there is danger of a new Coxey.

NEWS OF THE MINES.
The biggest quartz mining development '
in California during the current year will
undoubtedly be that at the Melones mine !
in Calaveras County, in which a great ore
reserve is to be rapidly developed further ;
by a 4000-foot tunnel, etc., and at which is i
to be erected ' the largest and best
equipped stamp mill in the State. This is
the result of the energetic exploitation of
the property by W. C. Ralston, who has
pushed development work for three years
and who has Just secured abundant East
ern capital for the large operations men
tioned.
The Melones will for many future years
be one of the notable mines of the
mother lode. It will Le notable not only
on account of the scale on which It Is
operated, the initial plant to consist of 120
stamps, but as an example of the work
ins of great bodies of low grade ore. The j
property consists of seven claims on Car
son Hill, near Robinson's Ferry on the
Stanislaus River. They include the Me
lones, Reserve and Enterprise mines, j
There are 1407 feet on the east vein of the j
mother lode, and 5166 feet on the middle j
vein. These properties are characterized '
by great bodies of low grade ore. The !
vein on Carson Hill is in place 3 100 feet j
wide. In past years considerable devel- ;
opment work had been done and more or i
less ore milled from the Melones, Reserve
and Enterprise mines, but the profitable
working or' such a property required the
initial expenditure of a large amount of
capital and mining was easily abandoned,
though the total production has been
about $500,000.
About three years ago W. C. Ralston or- ;
ganized the iuelones Mining Company,
with C. N. Felton and Robert Grayson
among the stockholders, and the property .
was bonded from the Melones Consoildat- I
ed Mining Company. It was desired to
explore tne bodies at dcth as much as i
possible during the term of the bond, i
There was a shaft on tne Reserve mine ,
about 200 feet deep, with drifts and cross
cuts. An adjoining mine was the South j
Carolina, with a tunnel 1080 feet in length. ;
It was desired io continue this tunnel over j
1600 feet to reach u.e ore ->odies of the ;
Melones company, anil a bond on the i
South Carolina was secured. W. C. Ral- j
ston was manager of the property, and i
under his direction and that of Superin- ,
tendent B. Deleray the tunnel was begun. |
The period of the bond made haste neces
sary and the result was that the world s
record for driving mining tunnels was
broken last fall and Mr. Ralston's report
of the exploit has been published all over
the world. Drilling began in January of i
last year and on September 24, 2bOS teet ot I
tunnel 7 by 8 feet was driven. The aver
age progress was 10.22 feet a day, 71. 6 i feet j
per week and 306.88 feet per month. For
one week the progress was 92 feet. Ihe i
total cost of the tunnel was $28,708, or ,
$11 02 per running foot. ;
This famous tunnel, which passed iza (
feet below the bottom of the Reserve
shaft, and other development work plac
ed "in sight" 650,000 tons of ore, a little
of it rich, but averaging between $4 and
$5 a ton. There was a great prospective
supply of low grade ore. On the show- |

The total Investment in this property j
will be $680,000. . .
The 120-stamp mill which it is expected
to have in operations in December next
will be approached by but one other mill
in the State, that of the Golden Cross :
mine in San Diego County, which has 120
stamps, but the new mill will have some
advantages in the way of efficiency. A ,
concrete dam and nearly three miles of I
ditch to provide a water supply will con- ,

The successful operation of such a
property will mean a good deal to the
mining "industry of the State, as will
be a demonstration of the possibilities of
low grade propositions and stimulate
faith and interest in them.
The recent storms have put the miners
on their feet as well as the farmers. The
abundance of water which has come at
last means a great year in the mining in
dustry in California. I-a-st year's drought
the production was unquestionably less

who were wafting in fear of another dry
year are ready to invest. Many owners
are ready to order that mill. Every
branch of manufacture and trade de
pendent on the mining Industry feels that
this is to be a good year after all.
There is a feeling of confidence and
faith everywhere that promises a year of
more mining activity than California has
known in a generation.
One of the newly booming mining dis
tricts of the State Is Genessee Valley in
Plumas County, which has gold, copper
and coal among its mineral resources.
Coal was discovered about a year ago
and the recent copper boom has brought
the copper deposits to the front. The
Genessee quartz mine, owned by a Mrs.
Gruss, has been remarkably successful
lately, adding still more to the fame of
the valley. Now efforts are being made to
construct a narrow-gauge railroad con
necting the coal and the copper deposits,
a few mile 9 apart.
The ten new stamps added to the mill
of the Black Oak mine, Tuolumne County,
began dropping last week.
James V. Coleman and some associates
will reopen the Angels mine at Angels
Camp, Calaveras County, which has been
closed for eight years.
The legislative bills amending the
State law of location are among- those
which at this writing are in the hands of
Governor Gage, unattended by any an
nouncement as to what he will do with
them. It is presumed they will be laws,
and if bo prospectors will have to take
a brief course in location law again.
The Santa Ysabel mine at Stent, Neva
da County, is one of the many California
mines ready to double its milling capacity.
The Santa Ysabel will add twenty stamps
to the twenty it now runs.
The recenx heavy storms started hun
dreds In the mountain counties to hunt-
Ing along hillsides and water courses for
nuggets and pieces of rich quartz "float"
brought to view from amid gravel de
posits. One Nevada City boy found a
specimen worth $170 the other day and
similarly valuable finds are frequently
made.
At the Pioneer quartz mine near Towle
Placer County, there were 925 tons of ore
crushed during February. The gross
earnings were $11,500 and the net earnings \
$7000.
The Pine Hill Mining Company has just
paid an odd little judgment rendered
against It by a Justice of the Peace of
Nevada County. A miner named Mc-
Knight was told he could go to work, but
he was not put to labor right away. He
sued to be paid for the time he spent
waiting and secured $72.
The directors of the Pioneer Mining
Company, operating in Placer County,
will probably increase the capital stock
from 100,000 to 150,000 shares to provide
working capital.
According to the Redding Free Press a
rich strike in the Mammoth mine near
Kennett is reported. The strike was maue
in the lowest tunnel. The tunnel was
driven 900 feet before the ledge was final
ly cut and as far as they have gone
through it is richer and larger than any
thing that has yet been found in that ais
trict. Twenty-five men are at work and
the ore will be shipped to Keswick.
There are 250 feet of backs.
Some Eastern capitalists who hold a
bond on the Bay Horse mine in San Diego
County are considering the enterprise of

MILLIONS FOR BIG COPPER OPERA
TIONS IN THIS STATE.
The remarkable recent boom in copper
has had -wide results in Caliiornm,
though without attracting very muchj*t
tention. Many properties ha\e been sow
sÂ« 1^ >&f as
State, is crowding operations at Iron
Mountain and at its big fmelters atKes
wick, where several hundred tons of ore
are handled daily, and the scale of Its op
erations is to be increased. Otherwise the
only increase in the output is coming
from a number of small mines. About ten
such mines are now shipping to Selby s an
aggregate of about 200 tons per month.
They are mines in the Spenceville copper
region in Nevada and Placer counties and
in the neighborhood of Camp Seco In
Northern Calaveras County. Fresno
County is shipping ore also. In these and
other copper districts a good deal of pros
pecting Is going on, and these small op
erations are causing development of prop
erties that may assume much larger fu
ture importance.
The chief activity, however, is in the
great copper belt of Shasta County, in
which the Iron Mountain mines are lo
cated. Extensive undeveloped copper de
posits in the neighborhood of Copper City
and elsewhere along the belt are receiving
the attention of copper-hungry capital,
for which they have so long waited, and
there is a prospect that extensive smelt
ing plants and mining operations will cre
ate another Butte City there. Some New
York people have bonded the Herrin
group of seven copper claims and cuts
and tunnels are being run. Development
work is being pushed by another Eastern
company, which recently bonded a group
of claims from Smithson & Graves. Per
haps the most important operations are
those being pushed by Lewishon Bros,
and other Eastern capitalists, who a few
weeks ago bonded for a year the Go
linsky group of claims and the Ferguson
and Goss properties, about four miles
from Kennett. The properties are being
explored by shafts and tunnels, and the
apparent extent and richness of the de
posits and the prospect of extensive
smelters being put in have given Kennett
a town boom. Another New York com
pany is similarly developing the Mam
moth mine and a group of adjacent
claims near Kennett. bonded from Salltzer
& Co. The Balakalela and Windy Camp
groups of copper claims are being devel
oped by San Francisco and New York
capitalists. Other extensive properties in
that same mineral belt are .the subjects
of negotiation or of active development
work, and there is every prospect of in
vestments aggregating millions In that re
gion and the development of a rich and
famous camp. Every smelter erected in
that region will serve the additional ben
efit of creating a demand for siliceous ores
for flux and the consequent working of
many quartz claims which it is useless
to develop now. And over In Lassen and
Phimas counties there are untouched and
unexplored copper deposits which are now
attracting attention. Copper will from,
now on assume a big place in the mining
industry of the State.

NEWS OP lOREIGN NAVIES.
A torpedo cruiser was launched' at Fu
chau on January 29 last. The vessel was
designed by Mr. Doyere, the director of
the dockyard, and Is 260 feet long, 27 feet
beam and 11 feet draught and displaces
875 tons. The horsepower is to be 7000,
calculated to give a speed of 23 knots.
Two torpedo-boat destroyers have been
ordered for the British navy from Par
son, the builder of the Turbinla, at New
castle-on-Tyne. The contract speed has
not been made public, but It is understood
that they are to beat the two boats re
cently built by Schichau for the Chinese
navy, which made a speed of 35 knots.
The French naval estimates for the
coming fiscal year amount to $60,413,200.
In order to economize as much as pos
sible it is proposed to sell a number of
vessels which have become obsolete and
| are only a source of great annual expense
i to maintain in some sort of efficiency.
| The new naval policy is also said to pro
! vide for a larger tonnage of cruisers and
; a less proportional tonnage of armored
i ships.
The longest continued naval engagement
mentioned in history is related to have
taken place In 1334 in the Mediterranean.
! Four Catalonian cogs, carrying 19S0 flght
; ing men, besides the seamen and also
i women and horses, sailed with a cargo of
cloths and other goods on board from
| Cadiz for Sardinia. When near their des
tination they were overhauled and at
tacked by ten Genoese gallics and cap
tured after a battle of ten days. The his
torian does not state the casualties
among the crew, women and horses, but
i the combatants must at least have been
very tired after a ten days' fight.
The British Admiralty advertises for
engine-room artificers, fitters, engine
smiths and coppersmiths, age limit 21 to
28, and pay $9 62 to $13 12 per week. In
ducements are held out in prospective ad
vancement to warrant rank, good life
pensions and other advantages. The pres
ent pay in the United States navy tc me

branches is from $70 to $40 a month for
machinists. $60 for boilermakers $oO for
coppersmiths and $45 for fitters. B> the

Interesting and valuable competitive
tests of water-tube boilers are to be ma. l.
on the British torpedo gunboat Shelrtriik.-
The vessel has four Babcock and Wilcoa
boilers of 1000 horsepower each, and nine
runs at sea of 1000 miles at speeds varying
from 12 to 17 knots are to be made with a
view of ascertaining the efficiency and
economy as compared with the Belleville
boiler. The latter boiler was tested In
1895 on board the Sharpshooter, a him
boat to the Sheldrake, and an exhaustive
report was made at the time of the Belle
ville boiler. The Sheldrake left for her
first run on February 28, and at the end
of the trials she will be turned over to the
cteam reserves at Dcvonport, Portsmouth
and Chatham to give engine-room artifi
cers and stokers practical experience in
handling these boilers.
THE DOOM
OF A NATION

present Czar of all the Russias at the

of the best part of their lives to .serve
the Czar. AX. NEWMAN.
Following is the article referred to by
Mr. Newman:
DESTRUCTION OF FINLAND.
Finland has been robbed of her consti
tution The Czar of all Russias, who but
recently thrilled the world with his. mes
sage of peace, has shocked it with his
decree of death to Finnish liberty. Ad
dresses of thanks in many tongues were
pouring in upon the autocrat and great
throngs were about to gather round his
throne to pay him homage. Then came
the ukase about Finland and a great hush
fell upon the multitude of admirers. Their
hopes for a new era were rudely shattered
at the sight of Finland shackled and
weeping in despair at the foot oÂ£ their
brazen idol of peace.
The brave people of "the land of a
thousand lakes' 1 deserved a better fate.
Few nations are more Interesting, none
have made nobler sacrifices for their lib
erty. Romance and heroism illumine
every page of Finnish history; and no
country was ever better loved by its chil
dren that Finland, poor in treasure but
rich in romantic traditions, in natural
beauty and song.
In some branches of literature Finland
stands unexcelled. Her remarkable na
tional epic, the Kalevala, is regarded as
one of the greatest literary treasures of
the world; and in no country have the
sacred sentiments of patriotism found a
higher or purer expression. Johan I.ud
vig Runeberg Is the greatest poet of
patriotism the world has produced. His
patriotic hymn to the fatherland, the
most touching of all national songs, will
Uvp forever in every Fiimsh he<irt; his
pictures of "a people who fougnt amid
hunger and cold" will never be blotted
out; his "Tales of Ensign Staal" will live
as an indestructible monument to the he
roism of the Finnish people in 1809.
The brutal destruction of Finland's con
stitution is a crime against liberty, as the
denationalization of net people will be a
loss to humanity. Finland has the sym
pathy of every free and liberty-loving
people; but it will avail nothing; her fate
is sealed. She must follow the path of
Poland. As Russia's destruction of Po
land was the great crime of the last cen
tury, so the rape of Finland by the ogre
of Russian despotism is the crying out
rage of the present.
Autocrats ruled Europe a hundred years
ago, when the spoliation of Poland was
perpetrated. Now the people rule in
Western Europe and America. The Polish
people invited national destruction by
their dissensions; the Finnish people have
defended their rights and liberties not
only with courage, but also with rare
wisdom, unanimity, tirmness and skill.
The autocrats acquiesced in Russia's ab
sorption of Poland from fear; the great
powers of to-day could easily compel Rus
sia to restore the liberties of Finland, but
they will not even whisper a timid pro
test. The present century will close, as
did the lastâ with the hideous altar of
Muscovite despotism reeking with the life
blood of a free people.
And the free nations of to-day witness
the abominable spectacle and then go
about their business, as did the tyrants
a hundred years ago.â Skandinaven.

SCOTT & BOWNK, Chemist" New Yocfc,THE PESTHOUSE
SCANDAL WILL
NOT SUBSIDE
Action Will Probably Be Taken
by the Supervisors To-
Day.
Plans for a Permanent Correction of the
Evil Must Give Way to Some Measure
for the Temporary Relief of the
Unfortunate Inmates.
f I *HE unfortunate condition of the
inmates of the tumble-down old
i hospital on San Bruno road,
known as the Pesthouse, will be the
subject of some legislation on the
part of the Supervisors this after
noon. The miserable state of affairs
that existed during the last rain has j
aroused sympathy on all sides, and j
there is a general expression that
something should be done to make ;
the hospital more like what it pre
tends to be and less like a prison.
The Supervisors will appoint a com
mittee to investigate and report such
changes or repairs as may be possible
to make the old place habitable un
til there can be some means devised
for providing the permanent inmates,
the lepers, with suitable quarters.
Supervisor Holland has declared him
self in favor of repairing the olrl build
ing until the question of a new hospital
. has been settled, and of then providing I
at the same time a place for lepers and I
patients afflicted with contagious dis- I
eases. The hospital matter is one that j
will come before the board within a i
few weeks, and Supervisor Holland be- |
lieves the question of a pesthouse can j
be settled at the same time. Until then, i
he says, the city should make the old |
place as comfortable as possible, and j
that, too, without delay.
Supervisor Byington is also willing to
do anything to make the place as com
fortable as circumstances will permit, j
and Supervisor Perrault deciares that j
he will do what he can to bring about a
better condition of affairs. As a medi
cal man, he believes it an injustice to j
; atients in such an unhealthy ]
place, holding them for no offense ex
cept that of being afflicted with disease, j
and denying them the poor privilege of ;
seeking better quarters when the ones
assigned to them have become unfit for
habitation.
â¢The hospital question will not be set
tled this year," said Dr. Perrault, "for
we cannot undertake such an extensive !
piece of work and still keep within the i
dollar limit, to which we pledged our- j
selves. We will have to let all question
of the hospital go over until the charter
has been put in force. It is a shame we
can do nothing for those unfortunates,
but there is no money in the building ;
fund now and there is no chance of I
there being any before next winter, so
all we can possibly do is to make such
repairs as the old building will stand."
Dr Perrault will bring the matter to
the attention of the board this after
noon, and so will Supervisor Holland,
and it is certain something will be done,
although there is a chance of it being,
for a while yet anyway, anything more
than temporary repairs.
There have been two plans broached,
but as yet nothing has come of them.
One of these was to have the lepers de
ported to the island of Molokai. where,
under some arrangement with the Gov
ernment at Hawaii, they could be kept
at the expense of the State. The other
was to make overtures to the Federa
Government to have them kept on Angel
Island at the quarantine station where
they could be made useful and their en
forced isolation could be made less like
The Pesthouse was erected by the i
cltv in IS6B, and even then, over thirty j
vpars ago, it was intended only as a
temporary structure. It was not ex-
Dected to last as long as a well-built
cowshed, yet it has housed the city's
outcasts for more than a quarter of a
century, and still the end of its serv
ice is not in sight.
â¢ The lepers are not entirely helpless j
and some of them are quite as capable ,
of earning their own living as many
a one not condemned to the Pestnouse
enclosure. There are some of the in
mates so slightly affected as to deceive
any but the trained specialist, yet all
these are compelled to take the poor
shelter the city offers. A leper at any
time may be confined in the Pesthouse.

" 1 feel it my duty to write and thank

me any good. Before taking your medi-
cine, I was all run down, tired all the

The serious ills of women develop
from neglect of early symptoms. Every
pain aud ache has a cause, and the

' Write at the first indication of trouble.
He has no redress and to object is use
less. Under one of its many laws the
city or State may arrest a leper run

home he may have made for himself
and live under a sieve-like roof, in
rooms where carpets are unknown and
where pictures and wall paper are
strangers; between walls whosg shel
ter is a piece of sarcasm and through
which the winds piay as they would
through a pasture fence.
And then when the disease-ridden
patient grows tired of the draughts
that whistle around him he may go out
In the yard and walk from one angle
of the enclosure to the other, for his
world is bounded by the wall around
the rotting old shell the city says he
must call his home. There is no escape
for him except through death, and he
must sit idly waiting for the end with
out even the poor privilege of making
himself comfortable. The city has no
money to spend on the Pesthouse. Its
appropriation has been cut from year
to year to keep down the total while
other funds swelled, and now there is
not even enough to pay for an extra
nurse. Last year when one of the in
mates lay almost dying the Supervi
sors added $500 to pay one of the un
fortunates for acting as nurse, but
most of the sum was taken up in car
ing for some extra smallpox patients.
Every one admits the place is a dis
grace to the city. Every one admits
that as a hospital it is a sham and a
mockery. No one likes to hear it called
a prison, and yet it is worse than one,
for there is no escape, no sanitation, no
comfort, no hopeâ nothing but a long-,
weary wait for the grave.

the Howard Methodist Episcopal Church
last night. Both th<? subject of the ad

otic nature.
Dr. Wilson's text was: "Be of good '
courage, and let us play the men for our :
people and for the cities of our God."
"Patriotism is paramount to individual ]
consideration," he said. "Forget your j
personal Interests for your country's,
even at a personal sacrifice. The man
that sacrifices himself may lose grosser
comforts and possessions, but he gains
nobler qualities. The part of the true
patriot is to stand up against the invasion
of this country by foreign ideas and cus

entrance because we are no longer able to
assimilate it.

MARE ISLAND
IS TO HAVE A
WOODEN DOCK
Why the California
Navy Yard Lost.
MR.HILBORN'S STRANGE WORK
RECOMMENDATIONS OF DEPART
MENT ENGINEERS.
The Dock Will Be a Weak Structure,
Incapable of Receiving a Bat
tleship Without Endan
gering Her.
In the naval appropriation bill approved
May 4 1898. a provision was made for
four docks, any one of which might be
constructed of stone, the other three to
be built of wood. It was left with the
Secretary to choose the location of the
stone dock, and accordingly Boston navy
yard was selected and the contract for
that dock has been awarded and work be
gun Mare Island, League Island, Pa.,
and Portsmouth, N. H., will get the wood
en docks.
The plans of the wooden docks have
thus far been delayed In the hope of in
ducing Congress to alter the provision
specifying wood instead of stone. Wood,
as a material for drydock construction,
has been long discarded by all other na
tions because of its perishable nature and
general unsuitability. The reasons why
the United States clings so tenaciously to
it form an interesting story.
The advocates of timber docks, during
the past dozen years, have been backed
in Congress by a powerful paid lobby
who have been unscrupulous in their en
deavors to- defeat any attempt to change
from wood to stone.
This weli organized body has labored in
cessantly in the interest of certain build
ers of timber docks who hold patents on
these structures and with whom all con
tracts for such docks must of necessity
be placed. Another potent influence upon
which the lobby has counted with suc
has been the indorsement of the
chief of the Bureau of Construction and
Repairs, whose name has for years ap
peared conspicuously in reports and let
ters favorable to timber dock builders.
The Secretary of the Navy has long
since been convinced that it was but a
waste of public money to build timber
drydocks. In this view he is sustained by
all experts in this country and abroad.
These docks have within ten years cost
$600,000 in repairs and their average cost
of maintenance is over eight times that
of the stone drydocks. The present
wooden dock at League Island leaks at
the rate of 1703 gallons per minute and a
duplicate pumping plant has been in
stalled to keep it measurably dry. It
was necessary to remove the battleship
Massachusetts hurriedly from a timber
dock at New York, the structure imme
diately thereafter suffering partial col
lapse. Rupture and upheaval of the floor
have occurred with the dock at Port Roy
al. The battleship Indiana was docked
in foreign territory because our timber
<ii>'-k* were unfit to receive her. At
League Island, when a ship is docked, it
is necessary to shore up the abutments
tii prevent inward movement.
The limit of cost of each wooden dock
w:,s fixed at $800,000. In the naval appro
priation act, which became a law on
March 3 last, a provision was inserted by
the Senate increasing the limit of cost
to 81,100,000 ar.d stipulating that all docks
should be constructed of masonry. When
tho bill was in conference (composed of
Senators Hale and Gorman and Represen
tatives Boutelle, Hilborn and Cumraings)
three of the conferees held out firmly for
Etone, while Representatives Hilborn and
Cummlngs stood out steadfastly for wood.
At first neither Bide would yield and for a
time the entire bill was in great jeopardy.
Finally, as ?. last resort, a compromise
was effected which resulted in two of the
three docks b<Mng constructed of wood at
the original estimated cost of $SOO,OOO and
the other of stone at a cost of $1,100,000.
It is remarkable that in the face of the
earnest advice, even in the face of the
strongest opposition of such able men as
the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of
the Bureau of Yards and Docks, the Chief
of the Bureau of Steam Engineering and
of the greai American Society of Civil
Engineers of the United States, these
wooden docl<s wore recommended. Even
Secretary Long and his bureau chiefs
time and again assured Congress that un
less stone was used in the construction of
the docks they might better be left un
built. It is also remarkable that Mr. Hil
born, then Representative from Califor
nia, should recommend the construction
of a wooden dock at Mare Island, even
when Senator Perkins opposed that idea,
it is said, both in the committee rooms
and on the J-oor of the Senate and finally
in the conference.
The next session of Congress will doubt
less be asked to reverse this action and
have stone substituted for wood with an
additional appropriation of $300,000 for the
increased co-'H of proper material. In the
meantime the excavation and pile-driving
which will he necessary for either wood
or stone can proceed, so that no needless
delay may r-sult by reason of the change.
It is for Mr. Hilborn to explain why,
when Califo'-nia might have had a mag
nificent structure costing $1,100,000, she is
largely through his efforts to have an
Jsuo.uoo structure at Mare Island, where
the excuse will always be made by the
Navy Department that it is afraid, and
properly, too, to trust one of the great
battleships in a weak wooden dock for
fear of the collapse of the structure and
the probable destruction of the vessel.
The Bureau of Yards and Docks of the
Navy Department is now busily engaged
in preparing plans for the three new dry
docks. Much of the work of design has
already been accomplished, and it is ex
pected that bids for their construction
will be invited in a short time. Conse
quently the opponents of the wooden
structures will be compelled to act
promptly.

THINKS THE TEACHERS
CAN STAND ALONE
J. C. O'CONNOR OPPOSES COMPRO
MISE WITH MERCHANTS.
Teachers Can Fight as Individuals
and Win Under the One-
Twelfth Act.
There is still a great division of opin
ion among the teachers regarding the
compromise question. Referring to this
J. C. O'Connor, principal of the Mission
High School, speaks as follows:
It anything was made clearer than another
by the address of Mr. Creswell at
Monday's meeting It was that the only
hope for the payment of the November and De
cember salaries lay in the adoption of a con
stitutional amendment. I understand that the
proposed amendment brought forward by the
Legislature for that purpose will not be ap
proved by the Governor, but, be that as it
may, I fail to see how the turning over to a
trustee of my claims against the city will help
the passage of the amendment or how it will in
any way further the payment of those claims.
Neither can I see how giving the merchant
creditors a lien on my claims to help to make
good their outlawed claims Is going to make
my e'jually outlawed claim any better.
It Is agreed that the One-twe*lfth Act Is In
force. If so all claims in excess of the unet=
pended balance of $35,670 for the first term of
this fiscal year are void and the Auditor cannot
allow any claims for that period in excess of
that amount. In vlpw of these facts it seems
to me that the Auditor's quandary in regard
to legal and illegal demands is simply his own
affair: that he cannot without breaking the law
and at his own risk allow one cent on the
claims of the months preceding January' in rx
cess of the amount standing to the credit of
the?,- months, and therefore all the arguments
suggesting a further loss of salary to the
teacher? are â well, let us say groundless.
I attended the meeting on Monday hoping
that the discussion would enlighten me regard
ing the proposed compromise. I heard only
one side of the ea*e, the affirmative, but the
letters and speeches in favor of the compro
mise showed m* clearly how we stand and
proved to me that such a compromise could
do the teachers no good and most likely would
destroy any chance they might have of being
recouped by a kindly disposed Hoard of Hu-
PTvlsors In connection with the Board of Edu
cation.
I believe the merchants should be paid. I
am perfectly willing that they should tnke the
whole Jio.ooo. I eald when this controversy w;is
so suddenly sprung upon us that the only sen
sible thing to do was to let the merchants be
paid, to far as the available funds would per
mit, and thus enlist them as our advocates for
an Increased appropriation for the next fiscal
year by means of which our claims could be
paid. This could have been legally done had
we not "gone to law" and "In our anxiety to
find where we stood discovered that we are
not statutory officers. Now, however, I be
lieve It Is better that we stand alone. We enn
reco\'er only by the favor of the public, and to
me It looks like Impudence to say to the good
people of this city. "Whatever you do for us
you must also do for these merchants."
There seems but one way now left by which
our claims may be satisfactorily settled, and
that Is that public opinion should permit the
Supervisors to appropriate for the School I>e
i>artment such an amount, within the legal
maximum, as would enable the Board of Edu
cation to Increase our monthly salaries for the
next fiscal year by an amount equal to one
twelfth of the sum due to each of us. Mr.
Creswell says this could not be done under the
law, but Supervisors have th<> right to make
appropriations and School Directors to fix Fal
arles. and this was done, without objection. If
I remember right, in the case of Mr. Voder and
Miss Ball.
Mr. Broderlck, I understand, still thinks we
are statutory officers. But it mleht b* well
to consider the propriety of appealing to the
Supreme Court on that point.
There has been a great deal of silly talk off
and on against teachers who failed to join in
this movement, and a sort of assumption that
the majority rules. A moment's reflection
should show that our claims are all individual
claims. No majority, for example, has any
right to assign my claim to any one, and, of
course, no majority or committee acting for
them could make any arrangement by which
some of those to whom salary is due could be
paid and others not paid, but although I am
satisfied that the action taken without my con
sent and later on against my earnest advice
hns cost me two months' salary, yet I think
the attorneys employed should be paid and
for the credit of the department I am willing
to contribute my share toward that end, and
I further think that we all should be as will-
Ing to pay them as though they had succeeded.
They should be paid and discharged as soon as
p;>.Â»slble.

ACCIDENTALLY

A Valuable Cargo for Vladivostok.
Wreckage Sighted by the Co

Renamed.
There was a peculiar fatality on the
British ship Haddon Hall during her voy
age from Puget Sound to Yokohama. It
is the old story of "Didn't know it was
loaded." a tale of which rarely if ever
comes from the sea. The Haddon Hall
arrived In Japan prior to the sailing of
the Doric and the story of the tragedy
is as follows:
The Haddon Hall sailed from the Sound
last December and all went well until the
vessel was passing through a group of
islands known to be infested by pirates.
Chief Officer Thomas Jones had no gun,
so Captain Pritehard loaned him a re
volver with which to arm himself in the
event of the ship being attacked. The
mate put the pistol in a drawer in his
room and there Harry Hartog, a 19-year
old apprentice boy, found it. He had
never handled such a weapon before and
was delighted with "the plaything." He
showed it to William Hughes, another ap
prentice boy, who said the revolver was
not loaded, as the mate had drawn the
charges. Hartog began snapping the pls
tol at Hughes and the third time the ham
mer fell it went off and the bullet struck
Hughes in the neck. Captain Pritehard
and Mate Jones did everything possible
for the lad, but he bled to death in twenty
minutes. The Haddon Hall went from
San Francisco to the Sound to load and
both boys were well known in this port.
Hartog was tried before the British Con
sular Court in Yokohama and acquitted.
There is a big demand for vessels for
the coasting and island trade, and In con
sequence the shipbuilding yards from San
Francisco to Puget Sound are all busy.
Hind, Rolph & Co. are having two schoon
ers and a barkentine built for the island
trade; C. A. Hooper & Co. will shortly add
a barkentine to their fleet of lumber ves
sels; J. S. Kimball & Co. have contracted
for a large steamer to be built on Puget
Sound; Gray & Mitchell will have a tin.-*
11-knot vessel on the coast early in July
and half a dozen other firms in the city
have ordered vessels.
C. A. Hooper & Co.'s new barkentine
has been named the Manila. She was
launched on the 11th inst., and will soon
g-j into commission. She was built at
North Bend. Or., and will carry a million
feet of lumber. As there is a great de
mand in Australia and South Africa for
Oregon pine the chances are that the Ma
nila will make her maiden voyage to one
or the other of these places.
Gray & Mitchell's new steamer is to be
named the Dispatch. She is being built
at Eureka, and will be 193 feet on the keel
and 205 over all, 38 feet 6 inches beam,
15 feet 6 inches draft and will carry 700,
--000 feet of lumber or 900 tons of general
cargo. She will come here with a load of
lumber, will be eugined by the Fulton lro n
Works and will be ready to go into com
mission on July 1. A description of the
other vessels being built has already been
published In The Call.
If shipping and shipbuilding is good in
the United States it does not seem to be
equally so in England, judging by the
prices offered and accepted for shares in
vessels at a sale in Liverpool recently.
For an eighth of the Miltonburn $17,500
was offered and refused, for an eighth of
the Otterburn $17,000 was the best offer,
and it was refused, ffwo sixty-fourths of
the Drumrock were sold for $2200. Forty
$200 shares in the Helenslea brought $850.
Twenty $25 shares in the Frances Fisher
brought $250 and twenty $25 shares in the
Beechdale brought $250. All these vessels
art' well known in this port, having been
here on many occasions from either Eng
land with general merchandise or Austra
lia with coal.
The captain of the steam schooner Co
quille River, which arrived from Co
quilie yesterday, reports that on March
25 between Cape Mendoctno and Point
Arena he passed through a large quan
tity of lumber and shingles. There is a
big fleet of lumber-laden coasters on its
way here and the chances are that one
of "the schooners lost her deckload dur
ing the recent heavy weather.
The schooner Albion, which arrived
from Coquille Saturday, lost her jib boom
while crossing the Coquille River bar on
March 19.
The Chilean ship Temuco, which put in
here in distress on the Ist inst., tried to
resume her voyage yesterday, but had to
come back again on account of a foul an
chor. The Temuco was on her way from
Icjuique to Victoria, B. C, with a load of
nitrate when she was partly dismasted
in a gale and had to put in here for re
pairs. She will probably get away to
day.
The names of the United States trans
ports Scandia and Arizona have boon
changed. The former Is now called
"Warren and the latter Hancock. The
"Warren was formerly a German tramp
steamer and the Hancock a British pas
senger steamer.
The transports Charles Nelson nnd Zea
landia will sail for Manila on Wednes
day. The Nelson will take away about
90 1 )" tons of supplies and 100 soldiers and
Red Cross nurses, while the Zealandia
will carry about 600 soldiers.
The ship Lueile. which sailed for Vladi
vostok, Siberia, last Saturday, took away
the most valuable cargo that has ever
left San Francisco for that port. It con
sisted of flour, tallow, bicycles 1 , salt,
hardware, agricultural implements- and
other goods valued at over $67,000. The
bark Wilna is at Howard street loading
for the same port. Frank Mighell, son
of the managing owner of the vessel,
will make the round trip on the Wilna
for his health.
The British sealing: schooner Geneva
put into Fort Ross the other day with
1243 skins, all taken on the coast. The
captain reports all well.
The revenue cutter McCulloch is be
ing repaired at Mare Island and then?
are no quarters for her crew. The cutter
Rush has therefore gone to the navy yard
and the McCulloch's crew will live
aboard her. The Thetis is coming down
from the yard to he repaired here, and
while work is being done on her the crew
will live aboard the Bear, which is to
come down from the yard and anchor in
the stream for that purpose.
A CBYSTAL ANNIVERSARY.
Lincoln Corps of the Woman's Belief
Corps Celebrates Its Fifteenth
Birthday.
Last Thursday Lincoln Corps No. 3,
Woman's Relief Corps, an auxiliary to
the Grand Army of ' the Republic, was
fifteen years old. and in the evening the
members of the corps, members of Lin
coln Post, G. A. R. , and a number of
friends of each assembled in the upper
hall of the B'ne B'rith building to cele
brate the crystal anniversary. The corps
is composed of loyal women who have
for their object the aiding of all soldiers
and sailors who nerved in the War of the
Rebellion, irrespective of the fact that
they are not members of the Grand Army
of the Republic; also to aid the families
of such. From the introductory- address
by Mrs. H. J. Holbert, the president of
the corps, on Thursday night, it appeared
that in the fifteen years of its existence
the corps has distributed a little in ex
cess of $13,000 to those who come under
their care, and that does not include
clothing, groceries, coal and provisions
distributed to the families of the heroes
of '61-65 during that period.
Mrs. E. d'A. Kinne. past national presi
dent and first president of the corps, de
llvered a very eloquent address on the
work of the corps and paid a most de
serving tribute to the noble women who
had successfully carried on the work
which had been commenced fifteen years
before. This was followed by a short
programme of entertainment which was
made up of vocal selections by Miss Zelia
Cook, Mrs. Powell and the singing of a
song dedicated to the corps by Mrs. Alma
E. Keith, in the singing of which Miss
Emma Keith, daughter of the composer,
led. There was also an address of con
gratulation by Colonel C. Mason Kinne of
Lincoln Post, after which there was pro
gressive euchre in one hall and a donkey
party in the other. During the evening
there was presented to the corps a beau
tiful illuminated address of good wishes
prepared by H. W. Mortimer of Lincoln
Post, chairman of a committee composed
of the gentlemen named. C. J. Hanley. C.
Mason Kinne, W. M. Hilton and George
H. Stevens, and subsequently an immense
crystal punch bowl with silver ladle and
â  six dozen lemonade glasses from Lincoln
Post. The celebration closed with the
serving of a toothsome collation.

TACOMA, March 26.â Four masked
i robbers raided a store at Montesano on
! Thursday night. On Friday night they
i blew open the safe in the postoffice at
I Shelton, forty miles away, and obtain
i ed $800 of Government money. A large
I posse was formed yesterday and track
jed the bandits through the Mason
County forest. The po^se is headed by
: Sheriffs Vogtlin and Huss of Mason
I and Chehalis counties. Last evening
i part of the posse came upon the ro-bbers
i near Kamilchie and a fight ensued. The
! Deputy Sheriffs and robbers jumped
'< behind trees and shot at each other for
: half an hour. The Deputy Sheriffs had
; the advantage in numbers and succeed
!ed in shooting two robbers, one of
i whom was captured. The other limp-
I ed away, and was protected by his com
panions, who hold the officers at bay.
Going a short distance, the robbers
i seized a hand car on the Grays Harbor
branch of the Northern Pacific Rail
' road and would have escaped had not
\ an approaching train stopped them.
The posse was largely increased tcr
i day, and every road through the dense
i forests of Mason and Chehalis counties
!is being guarded. Both Sheriffs are
! determined to continue the hunt until
hunger brings the robbers out of their
hiding place.
The captured bandit is not danger
! c-usly wounded. He is now in the Shel
! ton jail. He refuses to give his name
j or reveal the identity of his confeder
ates.

LEAGUE SEASON INAUGURATED
i
FAMILIAR FIGURES HAVE VAN
ISHED FROM SIGHT.
Oakland Shuts Out San Francisco in
a. Game That Proves Highly
Interesting to 6000
People.
Your Uncle Hennery dispensed with the j
time-honored brass and yesterday, and j
nary a hackman was given a job hauling j
gaudily bedecked ballplayers through the j
streets for the edification of admiring
multitudes. He even went so far as 10 j
eliminate Colonel T. Passe Robinson from ,
the festivities, yet notwithstanding all
these breaches of baseball tradition 6000 i
people invaded Recreation Park to witness
the ceremony of formally opening the Cal
ifornia League season of i ??.
There were many familiar faces in the j
grand stand and boxes and on the bleach- i
ers, for the baseball fever seems to have !
broken out again this year with all its ,
old-time virulence. People were there |
who have not witnessed a ball game since j
the days of the Haight street grounds j
and they shouted and perspired and tried ,
to break up the benches just as they did j
in. years gone by.
It was a real pleasure, too, to see Lncle ,
Hennery again mixed up in the sport, for
It assures the public of an honest measure .
of the real article. Jack Bonnet, now de- |
veioped into a real baseball impressand, ;
ana wearing chimneys on his lamps to ;
give -him added dignity of appearance, as |
well as J. T. ran. who may with pro- ,
priety be called the father of baseball on !
this coast and is again in the game as the :
head of the league, were also in evidence. !
Out in the field one looked in vain for \
come of the spavined favorites of the past
who donned a uniform and made a bluff
at playing the game long after they ought ;
to have been content to remain at home j
and play with their grandchildren. But ,
they seem to be shelved now high enough. ,
Old Blockers Hanley rode, his Charley- .
horse down to the park and instinctively
made for the dressing room, but he was
given the he-he by the colts and told he
would have to ill back on the mushroom j
privilege again.
But Rube Levy Is till in It. Rube does j
not cavort over the left meadow any
more; much to the distress of the kinder- j
garten, for he is now a full-fledged ur- j
pire. He made his debut in a white over- ,
garment that resembled his "nightie
With the lower half cut off. A white cap ;
that was not given an opportunity to ob
tain its full growth was perched jauntily
over the bare spot that is beginning to .
show on Rube's block, and altogether he â 
was a thing of beauty to his lady ac
quaintances, who were out In force to
watch him perform. â¢ > j
The game Itself was interesting enough .
to hold the crowd until the close, and al- j
thoUgh it resulted in a shut-out for I nele
Hennery's Native Sons by the Athenians
it was in no way discreditable to the home
team. Iberg was to have gone into the 1
box but he got hit in the- eye with a oall ,
while practicing Saturday sustaining a j
rupture of two blood vessels which will i
keep him out of the game for another j
week. Fitzpatrick, however, pitched a ,
good game, with the exception of the <
Wth inning, when Oakland bunched]
three hits on him. which, with a cluster
of rd-boiled errors, netted two runs.
The result would have been even more ;
disastrous but for a great throw by Hil
derbrandt from right Held, which caught
c Natives missed their great oppor
â¢tunitv to garner tallies In the second in
ning," when they filled the bases before a
man was retired. But a clever double ,
play spoiled the chance, for the next man j
up. was an easy out. ,''-JLÂ» '
Donovan and HiUlerbrandt distinguished
themselves by making sensational catches
in right field. In the seventh Muller sent
. out a long fly which Donovan went up >
into the air after and plucked with one
hand. In the succeeding inning Hilder- j
brandi destroyed a two-cushion shot lor .
Lee Hammond by getting under the
sphere after a desperate run, and homing
on to it. although he performed some
wonderful ground and lofty tumbling.
" Tne whoie secret (A Frisco s downfall ;
"was Moskiman. It was impossible for |
them to straighten out bis curves, for two
hits, both by young Dr. Pyne. were all
that were recorded to their credit. Moski
man was in great form for the beginning
of the season, and though he did not
make a strike-out record and hit two men â¢
he only gave two bases on balls. He was
ably supported throughout the game.
Lou Hardie played on the bench yester- i
day, but it was only a temporary arrange
ment. It seems Hardie went out clam
digging during the rain one day last week
and became waterlogged.
San Francisco was tirst up and went out
in one two, three order, though Riley was
fiven his base. Krug followed with a !
rive down to short, forcing Josh at sec
ond and being doubled at first.
Donovan opened the season for Oak- â¢
land with a beautiful double to right, but ,
got no further. Both sides fielded re
markably well, considering the small
amount "of preliminary work they have
Â been able to put in. and the spectators '
settled down to enjoy an even, hotly con
tested game. .
The explosion came in the last half of
the fourth, when-Schmeer opened up with
a single over short. Murphy bunted along j
the line to third and Riley threw high to \
, second to catch Schmeer. The latter kept
on toward third, but was pinched by Hll
g derbrandt, who made a terrific throw
across the lot from right field. Lange's ,
â¢single to left placed Murphy on third, |
from where he was able to score on Sul
livan's fumble of W. Hammond's bunt.
Borland laced out a single, sending Ham
mond 'to third, that young man sneaking
'â¢home a moment later when Hartman ab- j
F^nt-mindedly rolled the ball down to
Fitzpatrick.
Iri the lifth Moskiman reached second
on FBlderbrandt's muff of his long fly. i
went to third on Shea's out to first and !
scored on Donovan's long fly to center.
That ended the run-getting, but there :
were frequent narrow escapes from more ;
tallies on both sides In almost every In
ning. Altogether it .was a most satisfac
tory Inauguration. The teams are well :
matched, the public demonstrated that it \
is- ripe for baseball, and if the country i
teams can keep In the procession the sea
son of 1599 will undoubtedly be one of
the most prosperous ever experienced
â¢ here. The score;

Club Match Won by Nauman by a
Score of Twenty-Four Out of

Although there were several rival gun

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, .MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1899.
MAUD S WON THE OPEN
STAKE AT UNION PARK
A BIG CROWD WITNESSES SOME
FINE SPORT.
Mercy May the Runner Upâ Splendid
Showing of Whitehead in the
Sapling Event.
The crowd that attended Union Cours
ing Park yesterday was only partially
eclipsed by the vast throng that witnessed
the competition for the Joiin Grace cup
some weeks ago on the same grounds. The
excellence of the card and the fact that it
was the only c-"-"ing to be seen in this
portion of the State were responsible for
the large attendance. Betting was ex
tremely lively throughout the afternoon.
All the pool boxes were running in full
blast and every man in them ad his
hands full handling the money of the
eager wagerers.
The open stake was won by Maud S in
clever style, her runner-up bcin - N*ercy
May. The final was short and decisive.
i The two bitches were slipped to a
straightaway hare, and Maud S took the
lead and killed before the turn, making
I the score, by Judge Grace's system of
counting, 3 to 0. Mercy May has been
running several years, but it is only in
the past month that she has shown speed.
The defeat of Gladiator, who was looked
i upon as the stake winner by many, by
j Victor Queen was a sad blow to the "tal
! ent," who backed him heavily. The fol
-1 lowing shortends landed during the run
ning of the open stake events: Rollicking
Airs beat Mayflower at 3 to 5; Lamplight
er beat O'Grady at 1 to 4; Wait a Little
beat Jennie Wilson at 1 10 3; Lady Emma
beat Tod Sloan at 4 to 5; Hadiwist beat

i Lady Emma beat Luxor at 1 to 4; Victor
Queen beat Lowlander at 1 to 2: Pretender
beat Lord Byron at 2 to 5; Victor Queen
beat Gladiator at 1 to 2. and Pretender
beat Minneapolis at 4 to 3. In the sapling
event Cinderella beat Cash at 1 to 3.
The showing Whitehead made in the
puppy stake was a surprise to many. The
little fellow had never seen a hare until
Friday last, but yesterday he went out
and beat good performers in fine style.
He has speed and possesses cleverness
and is looKed upon as a coming dog by
expert 3. Following is the way the dogs

Puppy Stake for Los Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, March 2fl.âThreaten
ing weather this morning had the effect
of somewhat reducing the crowd at the
coursing at Agricultural Park, but toward
noon it cleared up and there was a fair
attendance during the afternoon. The
programme consisted of a thirty-two dog
open stake, with a consolation purse for
the dogs beaten in the rundown. In the
stake Duty won first money, with Merry
Maiden second, Moloch third and Moun
tain Belle fourth.
In the consolation Occidental took first
money, with ABC second, Barry Sulli
v;in third and Lassie Hays fourth.
On the whole the "short-enders" fared
well, the talent being dumped heavily in
several events. Orpheum Lass was unfor
tunate and dropped considerable money
for her backers. Those who pinned their
faith to Duty did well, as she was on the
short end throughout the day, and in the
finals went bepging at one to six.
Next Sunday the first regular puppy
stake ever given on the local field will be
run. There are several promising puppies
coming into' running form, and a stake
was made up to give them a chance.
No Coursing at Stockton.
STOCKTON, March 26.â Owing to the
flooding of Goodwater Grove the Stockton
Coursing Club abandoned the regular
Sunday meeting for to-day. The field was
partially under water and the remainder
was in such shape that owners did not
want to risk their dogs.

The club winning the highest percent- |
age in the matches in the above sched
ule during the season will receive the
silk pennant presented by Edward
Brown, president of the California Crick
et Association. In reckoning the per
centage of a club drawn matches will
not be counted. All the matches will be
played on the grounds at Webster street,
Alameda, Freeman's Park at Golden
Gate being no long^ available for crick
it' rs. There being three city clubs and j
only one ground, one team will be com- I
pelled to stand out each Sunday.
The newly formed California Club will !
be able to put a strong team Into the j
field, for it includes H. H. Cookson, E. '
G. Sloman, Arthur Dickenson, J. Guild, |
W. Reeves and A. W. Lugg, all of whom I
are well-known cricketers. Among the j
members who have not yet earned a
reputation in California are W. R. Wil
liams of Philadelphia, F. M. Gunn of Ta
coma and W. E. Howells of Chicago.
The Pacific Club has a splendid wicket
keeper and batsman in J. Myers, who.
In the four matches In which he played
last season actually made the highest
batting average. 38.25, but was not eligi
ble for the Burnell prize because he had
not played in enough games. The Ala
medas also will have a good team.
The secretary of the California Cricket
Association has sent communications to
the clubs at Keswick In Shasta County.
P.urns Valley and Lakeport In Lake
County. Loomis In Placer County, San
Jose and Los Angeles, asking them to ap
point delegates to the association. It is
quite likely that both the Lake County
clubs will come into the association, but !
it is doubtful whether Placer County and !
San Jose will be able to get together â 
elevens this season. It is proposed to
make up an All California eleven later j
in the season to visit Portland and Ta- I
coma, Victoria, Vancouver and possibly I
other towns in British Columbia. The i
tour will be under the management of the
California Cricket Association, and oniy
members of clubs In the association will j
be chosen on the representative team.

Church.
t-very scat, aisle, nook and corner of
the <>; of the First Congrega
tional Church v . a yesterda
n t y. an . of m< n assem
bled' to b< ar Mr. Moody preach U
special sermon.
Ttte evangelist seems to be at his best
vhen admonishing the erring masculine,
â¦-specially the more youthful portion of
thats-ex, because they are particularly in
need, of saving grace and because they,
he holds, are the hope of the world. Yet
the -old ones do not quite escape his at
tention, because they have a duty In the
â way -of example.
'.'lf you teach your boy to tell a lie for
you," said Mr. Moody, "soon he -will tell
I t you." And again: "A Chicago
merchant once complained to me of the
increasing dishonesty of his clerks and
1 called his attentii n to the duties forced
on those clerks to deceive the customers
- they were sell
. told him if ills employes were or
dered to sell. â  c woolen goods,
thereby deceiving the public, could he

the customer turned around and robbed
the teacher?"
â¢Th-e services began by Professor Tow
ntr singing, with . hirus by the audience,
"And I Shall See Him Face to Fa<
Tell the Story Saved by Grace." It was a
noble me] .5 of fully
80Q0 v ball with floods
I r.g.
â  -'.Following t several hymns
Mr. Mood] - riurse from the
:er of Galatians: "Be not de
r whatso
ever a man soweth that snail he also
reap."
"Sowing and reaping," said the revival
ist. "I want to ' got that in your minds.
No matter what the sowing is. the reap
ing, will be In like order. Jacob sowed
when he decei-ved his. father and his har
vest was in like order. Note this: As no
table a person as Jacobâ third in the line
of the covenant, back in the early dawn
of humanity, reaped that which he sowed.
HÂ« killed a kid and with its skin and
flesh; deceived n i s father and robbed Esau
of a birthright. His ten wicked sons sold
the .favorite boy Joseph into slavery,
killed a kid, dyed Joseph's coat In the blood
: and deceived Jacob for twenty long,
retched years. He sowed and reaped.
David's, greatest sin was adultery, and
this, sin afterward in his household
brought dishonor, death and rebellion to
â¢ his latter wretched days. Judas was a
mean, .miserly, dishonest man, and he
! reaped the thirty pieces of silver, the
gallows tree and the infamy of all time.
' "Be-not deceived. This text written In
this. book will stand. The one who wrote
never deceived and never can be deceived.
Â° Characterless sinners deceive and are in
tarn -deceix-ed. Character !s everything.
Some people think we spend too much
â¢ money .trying to build up character. In
my tawn recently $10,000 was spent in
hanglrtg a young man. "We might have
got. some character in him for much less
and. saved him as well as all that money.
A drunkard is deceived because he never
Intended to become such. But he kept
at it till he is lost, body and soul. And
the man who sells him the whisky: will
he not reap of the intoxicating cup? And
v hat of the church member who in any
way countenances this hellish traffic â the
whited sepulcher who indirectly encour
ages the .irk that sends 300 young men
to drunkards' graves every twenty-four
hours.? I wish I could dwell on this
thing that is robbing our men of char
acter, respectability, Christianity, life
and the hereafter. You who are engaged
In the cursed business, better starve In
the 'Street than continue to drag men
d'owTi. What a martyr he would be who
died xather than sell whisky. The church
has .so few martyrs nowadays one would
be a blessing to it.
â¢ â  "David's sowing brought upon him the
fins -of his children. What is so bitter
to- a parent as the stab of a son. I would
rather a chiW of mine would kill me out
right than be years in doing so. It is
heartless to .hear a young fellow say.
Epeaking of his fathers faith: "I've had
Teligion crammed down my throat and I
have got enough of it.' As if any soul could
g-pt lenoue-h of what will make a man of

When! you hear a young man speak of his
parents as the 'old man' or the 'old
woman.' look out for his reaping. Isn't
s-in awful bitter? Is there any enemy
like sin? It Is hard to reap, but harder
still when you maÃe others reap wun
* At the close of his address Mr. Moody
asked everybody that would seriously
think on what he had said and make
an effort to improve their manner of liv
ing to aris"e. and all present stood up
while the evangelist offered an earnest
prayer that they might be guided in the
way. -of truth and light.
GOD'S WONDERFUL WAYS.

EVANGELIST MOODY
AND HIS WORDS
Rev. W. E. Dugan of the Stewart Mem
orial Church at Guerrero and Twenty
fifth streets delivered a discourse entitled.
"Evangelist Moody and His Work," last
evening.
The clergyman pronounced Moody the
greatest evangelist that has ever livedâ
even greater than White-field. He re
viewed the struggles of the exhorter's
boyhood and the efforts of his early ca
; reer. In ISSS, -while In Chicago, he rented
three pews in a church with an object of
: keeping them occupied by young men and
j boys. Later he established missions and
! schools. Continuing, the speaker said:
i "The amount of good this man has done
; for the world can never be estimated. In
J the years he has devoted to the teaching
I of Gods doctrine he has converted thou
j sands and shaken the infidelity of nations.
! Wherein lies his power? He is an ordi
i nary, unassuming man, with a voice that
! shrieks like a parrot's, and he certainly
j has no personal charms. We must con
sider that it lies in the fact that God has
I seen fit to work great things through hia
! instrumentality. In this Is a lesson. That
! God often chooses the weak to accomplish
: his will that it may be proven to men
; that all things are done, not by might
and power, but by his spirit.
"Every act of his daily life is symbolical
'. of humility and every fiber of his being
dances to accomplish acts for the good of
.the universe/J
'REST TOR THE SOUL."
Rev. Richard Tjader Preaches to
Women at Y. M. C. A. Auditorium.
A special meeting for women only was
His Grace Archbishop Riordan Blessed the
Palms at St. Mary's Cathedral.
held yesterday afternoon in the V.! M. C.
A. auditorium. There was a large audi
ence present when R. S. Boyns, general
secretary of the Sacramento Young Men's
Christian Association, who presided,
opened the meeting with a short prayer.
Rev. Richard Tjader of Stockholm
delivered an interesting address, first pre
facing his remarks by singing the hymn.
"O Land of God. I Love Thee So," in
which the whole congregation joined. He
chose for his text the beautiful Bible
story of the wandering dove and the ark.
"Many of us." he said, "are like that
dove, looking for a place to rest. Our souls
are flying and flying in the endeavor to
Qnd it. In the United States the people
need that rest for the soul more than any
ration, for it is the most restless in
the world. The soul can find rest only
with the Lord of Hosts.
"My soul at one time was restless, and
I thought Christianity ww made only for
women and little children. But I soon be
came undeceived. Satan tempted me to
seek after worldly things, but after ob
taining them I found, lfke the little i boy
who snatched at the soap bubble, that I
had nothing. Rest for the soul is what
we should all strive to attain.
Rev. Tjader referred feelingly to the
conversion of his sister on her deathbed,
her last words being, "There is no real
lov in the world without Jesus.
"Have your peace," the preacher con
cluded, "in the deep depths of your heart,
and give yourself to God and you will cer
tainly gettbat beautiful rest of the soul."
AT THE PAEK AND CLIFF.
McCoy and Stelzner Give a Boxing
Exhibition at the Chutes.
Great crowds had great fun at the park,
Cliff and surrcunding pleasure grounds
rday, and not an accident resulted.
The attraction of the day, however, was
at the Chutes. "Kid" McCoy and his
trainer. Jack Stelzner, were billed for a
three-round boxing match, and the match
came off. About 5000 people witnessed the
bout and the ladies in particular were
Jubilant at the opportunity to see the
man in action who proved the master of
noDular Joe Choynski. Btelzner is much
Weightier than the "Kid," but it was a
pretty match, growing warm at times
and savored of a contest to a finish.
At the park the crowd was large, but
the majority of people seemed to head for
the beach for the day's outing. Sutro s
baths were also well patronized by ad
mirers of aouatic sports The r^ ul L 3 % f

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1899.
PALMS WERE
DISTRIBUTED AT
THE CHURCHES
Final Sunday of the
Lenten Season.
EXbRCISES AT ST. MARY'S
HIS GRACE ARCHBISHOP RIOR
DAN BLESSED THE PALMS.
There Were Special Services at Near
ly All the Churches in the City-
Yesterday in Observance
of the Day.
Yesterday was Palm Sunday and was
observed by all the Catholic and X
tant churches in the city. The day is of
! peculiar significance, not only on account
lof commemorating Christ's triumphant
i entry into the city of Jerusalem, but it was
the last Sunday in Lent, and from that
day until Easter Sunday is a period ob
j served as most sacred and known by the
whole Christian world as Holy Week.
The services at St. Mary's Cathedral,
both In the morning and evening, were
! most solemn and impressive. The high
i mass at 11 a. m. was very largely attend
! Ed, the aisles being crowded throughout
! the whole service. His Grace Archbishop
I Riordan blessed the palms before the cele
bration of high mass and, as is usual,
they were presented to the faithful, the
congregation reverently presenting them
selves at the high altar and receiving
I them from the hands of Fathers Demp
| sey and Ramm.
The sermon was preached by the Rev.
| Father J. J. Prendergast. He delivered
;an eloquent discourse, impressing upon
his congregation the great importance of
' the day and also urging them to do all in
i their power to observe the next few days
i and to devote as much of their time as
possible to examining their consciences
' so that they might be prepared to cele
i brate Easter Sunday as ordered by the
â  church. At the evening vespers and bene
diction the sermon was preached by the
; Rev. P. E. Mulligan. Palms were again
distributed after they had been blessed
, by the Archbishop.
At St. Ignatius the day was solemnly
i observed by the Jesuit Fathers. At high
! mass in the morning palms were distrib
! uted at the close of the service, each of
I the congregation receiving a branch,
I which was handed them by the ushers
ias they left the sacred edifice. The ser
i vices at the evening vespers were espe
cially arranged for the occasion, the Rev.
I Father Woods delivering the sermon. The
j beautiful composition. "Palms," was well
rendered by John Desmond, and a select
!ed quartet, composed of Sidney Hope
, craft. J. Desmond, W. "Woods and Pro
fessor Berger, sang a number of the re
sponses.
At St. Luke's Church the sermon was
preached by the Rev. Dr. Putnam of New
York. In the morning at the close of the
: .sermon the holy communion was admin
istered to the congregation.
At the Westminster Presbyterian.
Church the Rev. R. Tjader delivered a
stirring sermon, taking for the subject of
j his discourse, "When he saw the city he
wept over it." After drawing his llsten
! ers' attention to the fact of how the mul
| titude paid homage to our Lord on his
I -way to the Holy City the speaker said
j that Christ could not but forget the grand
I scene and with his thoughts in the future
grieve to think that in a short time
those who were now shouting Hosanna
might be calling, "Crucify Him! Crucify
him!"
A LECTURE ON CRANKS.
Bey. Dr. Locke Discourses on Men
With Wheels in Their Heads.
Central Methodist Church, on Mission
street, was, as usual, crowded to the
doors at the evening service. As a conse
quence of the crowded condition of this
place of worship during the evening serv
ice It was announced that, commencing on
the third Sunday in April, the evening
service will be held in the Metropolitan
Temple for at least four Sabbath nights.
The subject for last night was: "Some i
Cranks and What They Have Accom
plished." Dr. Locke's text was Daniel
1:8. "But Daniel purposed in his heart
that he would not defile himself with the
portion of the King's meat nor with the
wine which he drank." In his sermon
last night Dr. Locke said: "The diction-
' ary definition of a crank Is one who lacks
mental poise and who is subject to im
practicable notions; but the masses of the
people apply the term crank to any in
! dividual who lives ahead of his time and
I steadily stands by his convictions, and
who is willing to suffer, if need be, for his
beliefs. I want to talk about some great
men who have been disparaged at one
period of their lives by being called
cranks and at a later time have been
crowned and honored as heroes.
"The world does not known its greatest
' men. It requires the perspective of the
years to discover the colossal proportions I
of truly great men. The fear of being
classed among fanatics has prevented
many a man from rendering valuable
service to his age. The reformer must be
valorous. The howling mob is composed
of cowards. The pivotal points upon
â which God has turned the epochs of his- |
tory have been men or women whose con- \
temporaries have denominated as cranks. :
It will be remembered that seven cities |
contended for Homer dead, through which
the living Homer begged his broad.
"Time is a just retributor. 'Tempora (
i Mutantur,' etc. â 'Times are changed and ;
Iwe are changed in them.' One age ex- j
ecutes Savonarola upon a scaffold and a j
later period honors i.im as a saint." I
Dr. Locke then called the names of j
1 many who had been denounced as cranks ;
i who are now regarded as makers of civil
| tzatlon: Daniel, Paul, Peter the Hermit,
j John Huss, Luther, Knox, Wesley. \\ 11
--! liam Carey, William Taylor, John Brown,
i William Lloyd Garrison, Harriet Beecher
Stowe, Neal Dow, Frances Willard, and)
closed the list with most appreciative ref
erences to Dwight L. Moody, whom he
said was "A flaming herald of the cross, j
whose love and enthusiasm have enlarged j
the boundaries of Christ's kingdom on
earth and have greatly increased the
population of the redeemed in heaven."
Concluding, Dr. Locke said: "The
cranks that God can use and is using to
day are those humble followers of Christ
who believe'in repentance, pardon, purity,
self-denial and brotherly love. An army
of Â«uch constituted m<-n is needed in
every city. Goodness is greatness, purity
| is power. " â â â â r=r
IN THE INTEREST OF
HOME INDUSTRIES
THE MISSION OF SAMUEL C.
IRVING.
Goes to Washington to See That in
Government Contracts California
Is Given Fair Treatment.
Samuel C. Irving, manager of the Paraff
lne Paint Company of this city and a
prominent member of the Chamber of
Commerce, Manufacturers' and Produc
ers' Association and a number of other
organizations the purpose â¢ f which are
to look out for home industries, left
yesterday for "Washington. He Will in
terview the Supervising Architect of the
Government and other officials and ask
that in the letting of the contracts for
Government buildings to be built San
Francisco labor and materials be given a
fair opportunity to compete with the
Eastern people.
The Government is about to construct
a number of buildings in and about San
Francisco and the plans and specifica
tions contemplated by the Government
Architect provide for a great deal of
Eastern material. In one instance the
contract for the roofing of the barracks
of the naval station at Terba Buena Isl
and has been let to a Philadelphia con
tractor. Correspondence between thu
contractor and firms engaged in the same
line of work in this city brought to light
the fact that the roofing to be us* is a
patent and all of the material will be
sent here from Philadelphia and laborers
from the East are to be brought out to
do the work. â  ~v : - , . , Â«k
In another line it Is the claim of the
architect at Washington that hollow til
i ing and terra cotta work are not as sat
j isfactory here on account of earthquakes
!as concrete or expanded metal. The lat
ter materials are all patented articles
â  and only manufactured in the East. Con
tractors here say that the theory of the
architect is incorrect, and as proof of
their claim show that in nearly all of
the large buildings in San Francisco the
hollow tile is used. In the new Postoffice
building the use of the hollow tile would
relieve the foundations of 3000 tons of
Â«Â»Â£,( Of H t
Believing that there has been an unjust
discrimination made against California
material and labor, the contractors will
seek to see that the matter is remedied.
Senator Perkins and Representatives
Loud and Kahn have already stated the
case to the authorities, and Mr. Irving,
being well posted in technical know. edge
| of the matter, will follow up the work
i done 'goes particularly to look out for
He goes particularly to look out for
i the interests of his own firm, but will
i make a plea for all the industries which
have been discriminated against. Vi ith
him he takes letters from the Chamber
of Commerce, the Manufacturers' and
Producers 1 Association, the Technicologi
cal Association and a number of other
organizations whose interests he will rep
resent. There is every hope among the
members of the associations that his
mission will be successful. Nothing will
be asked from the Government officials
but fair treatment. The principal de
mand will be that in the plans and speci
fications which call for Eastern material
clauses be inserted providing that ma
terials as good may be used.

UPHELD THE ACTION
OF JUDGE LORIGAN
The Supreme Court Sustains His Ap
pointment of a New Board of
Directors of San Jose's
Union Bank.
The Supreme Court upheld the ac
tion of Superior Judge Lorigan of Santa
Clara County in his appointment of a
new board of directors of the defunct Un
ion Bank of San Jose. The action of the
lower court was questioned by Charles
P. Braslan, who sought to secure from
the higher court a writ of certlorari in
order to review the action of the San
Jose Judge. Soon after the bank was
known to be in an unsafe condition the
Bank Commissioners began proceedings
to throw it into liquidation and the direc
tors were served with the papers in the
case. One by one they resigned and the
shareholders elected a new board, of
which Braslan was a member. Again
the directors resigned, excepting Braslan.
and the court made an order appointing
another board, omitting Braslan from the
list. Then he petitioned for a writ to re
view the matter.
Braslan contended that the order ap
pointing a full board of directors, which
practically ousted him from an office to
which he claimed to have been duly
'â  elected, was in excess of the jurisdiction
of the court and void, because it was
made without notice to him, and because
it did not appear that the occasion had
arisen for such action by the court. The
opinion denying the petition was written

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
ARE WEARY
OF WAITING
FOR A BRIDGE
How Cuvellier Won
His Majority.
MAYOR SNOW'S MESSAGE
WILL SHOW HOW TO AVOID
MORE PITFALLS.
Ban Leandro Sets an Example
Worthy of Being Followed.
A Municipal Joke
Repeated.
Oakland Office Run Franrlsco Call.
90S Broadway, March 23.
There is much merit in the dissatisfac
tion being expressed in Oakland and Ala
meda with the manner in which the new
county bridge is not being built This
bridge is the only public connec
tion between Oakland and Alameda
from the west end of the En
dnal City. ;ind thousands of people
use it daily. Somewhere about a
year ago the bridge was condemned, and
the railroad and the county were required
to build new bridges. The railroad com
pleted theirs about three months ago,
spanning the estuary with a steel struc
ture that is a big improvement to the
harbor. The county dallied on and is still
dallying. Contracts are supposed to have
been let, but for months practically noth
ing has been done. The old bridge has
been mostly taken away, but there is no
appearance yet of a new bridge. The
electric road is forced to make a detour
through East Oakland and completely
through the city of Alameda before it
can deliver any Oakland passengers at
the west end of the city. The distance
now being traveled is fully live times
what it need be. and this state of affairs
Will certainly continue for some months.
There may be good reasons why the
wealthy county of Alameda cannot con
struct a bridge" as rapidly as the railroad
company, but there can hardly be any
justification for the county taking a year
longer than the Southern Pacitic. This
Indifference is causing great hardship to
thousands of people who cannot forget
the fact that the bridge was to have been
finished many months ago, and it is not
yet started.
Councilman Cuvellier is a more versa- I
tile man than many of his friends are >
aware of. He was anxious at the last
election to obtain the highest vote for
Councilman, and in order to do this he
visited many places where votes are sup
posed to be made. Among others he was
a guest on the Saturday prior to the elec- i
tlon of the irrepressible Pondinkey Club.
Cuvellier is a very staid "Id fellow, and a '
clog dance is about the last thing any one
â would suggest in connection with his
name. At the Pondinkeys' banquet Cn
vellier was called on to do something. He !
proposed a speech and they laughed at
him Pandinkeys are too intellectual to
listen to speeches. Cuvellier was desper
ate He wanted that block of votes and
he 'must have it. Somebody suggested
a song but the candidate avowed he had
never croaked in his life. Somebody j
cried "a dance," and the crowd roared.
Cuvellier, however, was once young and
still can use his feet. He calmly proceed
ed to take off his coat and his vest, while
the Pondinkeys cheered. Cuvellier asked
the man at the piano to give him a rag
time tune. The most ragged-timed tune
was given him. and his feet began to
move. It was a revelation-a dream. The
fellow thumped the piano, Cuvellier
thumped the stage and kept on, and on, .
while the crowd beat time to the candi
date's efforts. Dignity was forgotten in
the enthusiasm of the half hour Finally,
with perspiration falling like rain on the
stage Cuvellier stopped. There was an
.eVcore and he danced again harder than
ever He couldn't stop, and flnall> he fell <
from sheer exhaustion. !
But his effort was successful. The Pon
dinkeys declared that it was a mistake to
have nominated him for a Councilman; (
he could dance well enough to be Mayor ,
At the polls every good Pondinkey voted
for Cuvellier. and his plurality was a
Bource of much chagrin to certain Lake- ;
side politicians.
Some drinks of beer and fiery whisky,
a quarrel, a fight and some stabbing. The
victim sat in a chair in a dark saloon
â¢with his life blood oozing from a gash in
his neck. Around him were fellows of
like caliber with himself, enjoying his pre
dicament and joshing one another about
the necessity of sending for a doctor.
Between drinks the sight of blood was
made the occasion for coarse jokes. The
proprietor of the saloon referred to the
fact that it was the second murder in that
saloon since it opened and expressed his
Indifference if there should be a murder
there every night. In a corner of the
room some one was banging away on a
piano, adding to the din and making the
demoniacal scene more complete. Final
ly a gurgle and a dead man rolled on the
floor. , . . .
These, as near as can be ascertained,
â¢were the conditions accompanying the
murder of a jockey at the racetrack last
week, and by those who witnessed It it
â¢*-as all regarded as a mere incident.
Here are three facts in connection with
the Gilligan murder which need no com
ment:
Fact No. 1: "As I emerged from the
room Epperson started after me, evident
ly intending to again assault me, when I
raised the knife and stabbed him In the
neck. I then ran from the place and took
fhe first train for San Francisco."âMur
derer Gilligan's statement to the San
Francisco police when arrested.
Fact No. 2: "Who told you that this
knife was used?" Coroner Mehrmann
asked Saloon-keeper Dwyer at the in-
quest.
"Why," replied Dwyer, "Gilligan told
me himself that he had done it with that
knife."â Testimony of Dwyer under oath.
Fact No. .'i: "We, the jury, do find that
John Epperson's death was due to hemor
rhage, the result of a knife wound sever
ing the jugular, and we do further iind
that said wound was inflicted by some un
known person."
The people of San Leandro are full of
grit. Oakland could well learn a lesson
from this plucky little town. A year ago
they put up a big bonus and gave a lot
of land to a large cannery company and
now the cannery is being rushed to com
pletion as fast as possible, ready to han
dle the enormous crops that the recent
rains have assured. This step whetted
the appetites of the San Leandrans for
more. A few months ago a proposition
was made to them that if they would
give another bonus a large fruit-drying
establishment would be built there. They
set to work and to-day's report shows
that they have the necessary amount,
with the exception of $14, which, no doubt,
â will have been subscribed by the time
this is read. I also notice that at the last
meeting of the Town Trustees a state
ment was madp that the total delin
quency in taxes amounted to 88 cents.
Another proof of the town's prosperity
Is the fact duly noted in the local paper
that on Thursday night Joseph Herrscher,
the "Mayor" of the town, went to the
metropolis to hear Melba.
"O ye of little faith" applies to Oak
landers as much as to the Pharisees to
whom It was originally addressed. For
thirty-three years this city has depended
on Lak-- Chabot for its water supply, and
not once in those years has it failed.
Every time there is less water than the
average rainfall the same old cry goes
out that there Is to be a water famine
and, of course, rival cities take delight In
spreading this fiction. Now, Oakland has
two water supplies, either of which could
supply the town, and during the past
months the talk of water famine has been
more pronounced than ever. As usual
the lake has filled up in plenty of time
and now holds a supply sufficient to last
Oakland for nearly three years, indepen
dent of the artesan supply that has been
developed recently. There will have to
be a new code of natural laws before
Oakland is visited by water famine.
During the recent campaign ex-Mayor
Davie caused a laugh by stating that
while in office he had electrified the City
Hall by auditing the bills for street
I sprinkling and i.nding that the streets had
| been duly sprinkled on some days when
an inch of rain fell. Everybody regarded
the statement as a romance, but it was
very probably true for it was repeated
last Tuesday" night. On this occasion,
while the storm was at its height and
Broadway had been washed as clean as
I rain and wind could clean it, a street
sweeper at full speed dashed down the
street, "cleaning" the street at so much
j per mile, according to contract.
Nearly every day of the Brandes trial
has produced a sensation, faince the day
j of Lillian's death there has not been a !
dull period in L.,is interesting case. Per
haps no other case has oeen surrounded |
with so much interest in this county.
Brandes led a Jekyll-Hyde existence; he
had wives to whom he was married and j
others to whom he was not; he cultivated
piano playing to drown the cries of his
suffering daughter; he connived ith his
attorneys to take the skull of his child
from her coffin; he put the State's hang
man on the stand to testify in his behalf;
he has caused two old friends to quarrel
to such an extent that they are now quot
ing scripture to show each other's delin
quencies; comparisons with ,ne hanging
of Durrant and the hanging of Lillian
Brandes have been introduced; a box full ]
of skulls, which the owner proudly de
clared ho had "pinched ." formed the di
version for one aay; dissertations on path
ology of skulls have lasted for days. a.nd
finally there is more than a suggestion
'that Brandes once made a confess. on. In
view of all the romance, tragedy, petu
lance and mystery that are inseparably j
connected with the case, it is as well to I
recall the fact that about next Wednes- !
day the jurors will find themselves face
to face with the one question. "Did Bran
des h.'at his girl to death and then hang
her?"
Xext Monday the new city g-overnment
â¢will take office. Much is expected of It.
I believe within the next two years Oak
land will have taken several steps in the ]
right direction. The trade of the city is ;
just btglnmntr to reap the benefit of the
vast system oj. electric roads that center
here. Many big improvements are in prog
ress and others are demanded. There will
be many practical questions to be handled !
and they will demand g-ood judgment and
strong character. No mountebanks are
wanted at the City Hall and it is indeed
fortunate that none have been elected.
There is good foundation for the great j
things that are expected of Mayor Snow.
Men posted on city affairs know that the \
outgoing administration is leaving the
city's linances in a tangle, with a certain
deficit on June 30. unless extraordinary ;
measures are followed. Mayor Snow's
message to the new Council will deal al- ;
most exclusively with the question of
linances and the Councli will do well to
follow his advice to the letter. With his
long experience in the Auditor's office Mr.
Snow knows what Is wanted and Qi
be depended upon to straighten matters
out and to keep them straight unless he Is
obstructed. With Mr. Snow the govern
ment of Oakland is a business, not a fad. >
and his advent to the Mayor's chair will
be an occasion for general congratulation.
and it will not be an experiment. L nless
all indications are false I think Oakland
will want another Republican government
when the government-elect shall have
filled its tern. STUART W. BOOTH.

earlier years he was anxious to be a
skeptic and tried by study to iustify his
inclination. He spoke generally of the
difficulties that confront students in their
theological studies and the manner in
which these should be met and over
come. President Harper spoke in part
as follows:
"Every student of the Bible must meet
with difficulties and doubts. This is the
natural result of study. To think is to
doubt, for no man taKes for granted all
he may think, ne must have doubts and
difficulties if be sincere. When I was
much younger I was anxious to prove
that the" Bible was only an ordinary book,
and a very ordinary one at that. I want
ed to believe that it was full of doubt
and difficulty, and I spent three or four
years trying to prove these things to my
own satisfaction. But with study the
light began to dawn and it grew brighter
and brighter. The man who does not
meet with difficulties is the hopeless
case. No one can help him, for he thinks
he needs no help.
"Difficulties will arise; It is a student's
duty to combat them and to discuss them
fearlessly and he will finally find that in
the Bible will be found the proof of the
foundation of the Christian religion, and
in the Bible God will be found the true
leader."

INSANE OVER RELIGION.
Monte Vista Gardener Who Kneels
Before Women and Prays for
Their Salvation.
OAKLAND, March 26.â Religion and his
supposed anxiety over the future happl -
ncsa of the gentler sex has once more un
hinged the mind of Carl Oscar Carlson, a
gardener, who only last December was
discharged from the Stockton Asylum.
Since his release Carlson nas been work
ing for a family named Welch at Monte
Vista, Piedmont, and has been annoying
ladies by accosting them in the street
to make inquiries as to their future wel
fare and the herebe.yond. On such occa
sions he would deliberately kneel down
and pray and sing, while his fair and con
tused auditor ran for her safety.
He was taken to the Receiving Hospital
by the police and will be examined to
morrow morning.

A Gasjet Wide Open Indicated Intent
or Carelessness, Yet His
Friends 3cout at
buicide.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 26.
Bourrouil Mathieu, aged 42 years, was
found dead in a room at the Huff House,
427 Ninth street, shortly after 7 o'clock
this morning.
Death was due to gas asphyxiation and
the dead man was found in a kneeling
posture by a chair near his bed. He had
occupied the bed during the night and
was but partially clad when the landlady,
Mrs. Josephine Brischaus, found him.
Whether death was accidental or suici
dal will perhaps be determined by a
Coroner's jury to-morrow night, for the
conditions surrounding the case are such
that a thorough investigation has been
determined upon by Coroner Mehrmann.
Mathieu had been employed for the past
five years as a washer In the Oakland
Laundry at Twenty-ninth street and San
Pablo avenue. His friends speak of him
as a man of frugal habits and economic.
Last night he severed his connection
with the Oakland Laundry and was to
have started in the laundry business for
himself, having leased a place at Third
and Washington streets. He told his co
employes he would first enjoy a week's
rest and expected to begin operations in
his new place a week from to-morrow. He
was in the best of spirits when he parted
company last night and immediately went
to the Huff House, intending- to rent a
room there for a week. The theory of
suicide is scoffed at by his friends as well
as by Mrs. Brischaus, who discovered
his dead body this morning.
"Mr. Mathieu rented a room here at
10:30 o'clock last night," said Mrs. Bris
chaus to a Call reporter. "He said he
wished the room for a week, but made
no arrangements about paying- the rent.
I did not notice that he had any company.
At 7:30 o'clock this morning I went to
arouse him and to ask him about the
rent. I knocked at the door, but got no an
swer. Then I tried the door and found it
open. Looking in, I saw him kneeling by
a chair at the head of the bed, dead. I
immediately ran down and gave the
alarm.
"I do not think he committed suicide, be
cause he seemed in such a happy frame
of mind last night. His death was
probably due to carelessness."
Officer Curtis, who was detailed on the
case, found the gas cock in Mathleu's
room turned wide open, and beneath the
dead man's pillow was found a purse
containing $60 or more.
Deceased was a native of Prance, aged
42 years, and leaves a widow and two
children, residing in Paris. He was a
prominent member of l'Union Francaise
of this city, under whose auspices the fu
neral will be held.
WILL RUN THE CITY
WITHOUT TAXATIOI
CANDIDATE SMITH ADVANCES
A NOVEL PROPOSITION.
Wants to Make Corporations Pay the
Running Expenses of the
Municipality.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park Street. March 26.
Alameda has a unique candidate for the
office of City Trustee in the person of
Ben J. Smith. Mr. Smith is running as
an independent. Besides "goinf it alone,"
he has Ideas that are strictly his own, and
purely original so far as Alameda politics
are concerned. He issued to-day a plat
form of his own. It is entitled "Smith's
Indenture," and the drift of it is that Mr.
Smith purposes to conduct the affairs of
the municipality without levying taxes
on the property owners. He sets forth as
facts for the consideration of the tax
payer the following guiding thoughts:
"Reduce the taxes by one-half and you
double the value of realty."
"A man's taxes shall always be in pro
portion to the interest he takes in poll
tics."
"Men who look after themselves only
will eventually be left to tnemselves and
high taxes."
He asserts that the gas company makes
a net annual nroflt from Alameaa patrons
of $30,000. He wants the city to confiscate
the works and turn this money Into the
public treasury.
Fire insurance companies. Mr. Smith be
lieves, are growing rich on their Income
from Alameda. He figures their profits in
the neighborhood of $55,000 per annum.
He will demand a yearly royalty of $20,000
from these corporations to maintain the
local fire department, which he claims is
run entirely for the benefit of the insur
ance companies.
According to Mr. Smith the telephone
company should contribute handsomely
toward paying the running expenses of
the city. He asserts it is making $18,000 a
year in Alameda and he thinks the least
it can do is to pay $4000 of the amount an
nually for the privilege of doing business
Mr Smith wants to have all the water
company makes. Its not -n-ofit last year
was $17 902 32. The city will run the works
if Mr Smith has his way. These various
amounts, he figures, will be ample o con
duct the city's business without levying
taxes on individual property holders.
His circular is creating considerable in
terest to-day and is the talk of the city in
political circles.

DR. GREEN PROVES TO
BE A TRUE LOVER
AFFIRMS HIS ENGAGEMENT TO
MISS ROEBKE.
Defies Parental Objections and Will
Make the Young Lady His
Bride.
I ALAMEDA, March 26.â A1l doublts as to
i the authenticity of the engagement of
Miss Amanda Roebke and young Dr.
Jacob S. Green have been swept away.
Early last month the doctor was ap
pointed surgeon of the steamer City of
Panama, plying along the Central Amer
ican coast. The day he sailed through
: the Golden Gate on his way to Acapulco
i to join his ship Miss Amanda Roebke, one
' of the belles of the Encinal City, made
I the announcement that she was the be
trothed of the lucky medico.
The engagement created a storm of ln
j dignation in the household of Green's
! parents. Mrs. Green denied most emphat
! fcally that her son was engaged and
' stated he was too young to take care of a
i wife. , Â
But love only smiles at parental objec
tions, nnd Miss Roebke is now prepared
to substantiate her statements that she is
engaged to Dr. Green, and adds further,
that they will be married in due course of
; time despite whatever obstacles Green's
i parents may try to throw in Cupid's
I pathway. , Â.
AVh^n the betrothal was denied Miss
Roebke wrote to her lover to telegraph
conflrn'.ation of her announcement imme
diately upon receipt of the epistle. The
doctor did not wire his reply, evidently
because it is a difficult matter for an ar
-1 dent lover to express himself satisfactor-
i ly to his adored one in a ten-word tele
i fjrnm But he wrote a letter that set all
doubts of his faithfulness at rest..
He readily admits that his parents do j
not love Miss Roebke with anything like |
the fervor that bus taken possession of
i him. Being beyond the jurisdiction of
â¢the old folks," the doctor has regained
his courage and will make Miss Roebke.
bis bride, all the angry and objecting
parents to the contrary notwithstanding.
I The wedding will not take place in Ala
medn nor. in fact, at any place where
' Mr. and Mrs. Green Sr. might interfeio
with the ceremony.
Ah soon as Dr. Green gets settled in his
i new position and is prepared to provide
' a home for his bride, she will join him in
Central America. If. after the wedding,
the doctor's parents show a disposition to
extend the "glad hand" and bestow the
customary blessing, the young couple
may visit Alamoda.

Brown authorizes the statement that he
will not hurt School Director C. L. Tis

never had any idea of inflicting physical
punishment on the celebrated telephone
talker, and fully appreciates his inability
to do so. He frankly admits that his chal

when Tisdale did not call it. Mr. Brown
is now convinced that they are both
pretty good at bluffing.
"I never had the least idea of engaging

paid Mr. Brown to-rlay. "When he
threatened to 'lick out of me I ex
pressed a willingness to meet him at any
time within a week on the public street.
My purpose was not -to invite a fight, but
I thought that if the doctor was a man
of his word and I was in for a thrashing
the sooner the agony was over witli the
better for all concerned. I see that my

Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth spoke last
night to the largest audience ever col
lected in Calvary (. hurch. Her subject
was "My Work in the State Prisons."
and long before the hour for the services
neither a seat nor comfortable standing
could be had.
Mrs. Booth's address was marked by
the eloquence of sincerity and the graphic
description of her personal labors in the
prisons, her striving for the spiritual ele
vation of the convict sufferers and her ex
hortation for assistance from all to alle-
viate their mental dejection drew tears !
from many in the audience.
"The success of our labors speaks for
the good they have accomplished," she i
said. "We have a membership of 3000
prisoners in our army. In nine prisons,
two of which are in this State, have we
! sown the seed of God. In the Joliet Peni
tentiary we have enrolled one-half of the
prison population. To breathe a sympa- |
thy. a warmth, a spiritual light into the
souls of these men is our great object. It
is the bringing of a blessing, soft and rich
in its effect, within prison walls whose
â¢stern front is naturally repellant.
"What good we have accomplished may
be seen in the difference of behavior of
! those before and after they have joined
our cause. The intractable become man
ageable because a loving face has been
placed into their lives, not the loving of
the face of the woman who talks to them,
but the memory of the face they saw in
their childhood, their own mothers. I have
seen faces hopeless, barren of any possi
ble joy suddenly shine and beam with the
light bf hope and a new being enter their
liv.-s. I tell you it is a triumph of relig
ion when it sweeps aside those things
which are averse to its planting and de
velopment and takes root in the heart
of society's outcast.
; "There are many in prison who grow
more rapidly in the spiritual life than
I anyhere else. There we can see the Oevel
[ opment of the soul, a reformation so
grea.t, a change we can hardly recognize.
And this is brought about only by indi
vidual work. Many times my heart has
ached, more than these poor men's
hearts, and I have all but given up to the
immensity of the labors, but when I see
the good results I am strengthened anew
with an invigorating life and gladlyDend
to what has become a labor of love.

MRS. BOOTH TALKS
TO THE CONVICTS
Mrs. Booth addressed six hundred con
victs in the prison chapel at San Quentin
Prison yesterday morning, her audience
seemingly being much impressed by her
words of exhortation and encouragement.
Music was furnished by the prison band
and a selected choir.
A novel feature of the occasion was the
selection of two of the inmates to deliver
addresses of welcome. H. E. Brown, the
Mendocino outlaw, welcomed Miss Jennie
Hughes, Mrs. Booth's secretary, while a
prisoner named St. Clalr officiated in a
similar capacity for the noted volunteer
herself. Both acquitted themselves cred
itably and were thanked for their earnest
word's of greeting.
At the beginning of her sermon Mrs.
Booth outlined the work of the Volun
teer Prison league and especially of the
Hope Halls in the East. She explained
these institutions to be homes where ex
convicts are cared for until work can be
secured for them. Many are conducted
by trained corps. In New York the influ
ence of the league is so powerful that
no prisoners are paroled until they have
the recommendation of its representa
tives. Speaking of criminals and the
causes of their downfall she said:
"After they are free thire is a greater
bondage. You have to endure the bond
age or heart and the bondage of life
something far worse than the bondage of
man. I want to point out to you the
hand that can save you from this bond
age, the hand that ran remove the evil
habit, the evil temperament and the de
sire to do evil. It is the hand of Christ,
the. Savior of the world. Without his aid
you can never hope to cope successfully
with the cohorts of satan, who is ever
lying in wait to drag you back into the
paths of temptation."
Ap soon as she had finished her address
Mrs. Booth met a number of the con
victs and spoke tn them Individually as
regards their desire to lead better lives.
Mrs. Duncan, wife of Lieutenant Colonel
Duncan, also delivered an address to the
women in their department with such
marked success that many of them ex
pressed their sorrow at the lives they
had led and stated their intention to do
better in tho future.
Mrs. Booth and her companions were
entertained as the guests of Warden Hale
while at the prison. They returned to this
city in the afternoon.

KENTUCKY'S GOVERNOR
WILL SETTLE HERE
Legal and Political Gossips Are
Guessing the Reason.
The Distinguished Newcomer Will Critically Inspect
Us â What He Knows About the Southern
Pacific Company and Its Interests.
William O'Connell Bradley, states
man, lawyer, soldier and at present
Republ . Governor of Kentucky.
haa bÂ« very suddenly and most
lly a person of marked in
:he people of this city. Gov
ernor has decided to settle per
mtly in San Francisco and take
up here the practice of law. In decid
ing to honor this city with his presence
listingiiished abilities Governor
Bradley has set the tongues of political
and legal gossips a-wagging, and
scores of men prominent in public af
fairs are wondering why Governor
Bradley has made his choice. In choos

of operations he has overlooked greater
communities if not better opportuni

This City His Field of Operations.
tie? nearer his Kentucky home. But
pome of the wise ones say Governor
Bradley Is eminently qualified to attend
to bis own affairs to the best advan
tage. Governor Bradley knows Collis
P. Huntington.
The dispatches pay that Governor
Bradley is now in the mountains of
West Virginia enjoying a much-needed
and well-deserved rest from his guber
natorial labors. lie has announced
that before he returrÂ«s to take up his
official burden again he will visit San
Francisco and "size up the the situa
tion." What that may mean remains
to be seen. San Francisco has its full
phare of able attorneys, and if Gov
ernor Bradley believes that he will be
able to "sise" them up and take their
mental competitive caliber in the time
he has reserved for himself, it is more
than likely that after he has finished
his inquiry he will have another guess
coming. But Governor Bradley knows
Collis P. Iluntinrton, and Uncle Collis,
It is said, is not altogether pleased with
his legal staff. It may be that Gov
ernor Bradley intends to make some
critical observations on the weather.
It is said that a chill has come into the
atmosphere in the neighborhood of
Market and Montgomery streets since
the adjournment of the Legislature at
Sacramento.
Governor Bradley docs not intend to
resign his high office to come to San
Francisco. A step of such importance
as the removal of one's influence from
home to a strange city thousands of
mile? away demands deliberation, par
ticularly when one is as old as Gov
ernor Bradley. He will not resign, but
will serve his term to its expiration in
December next. He will then favor us
â¢with his permanent presence.
While Governor Bradley Is not well
acquainted with many people in San
Francisco or in California, it would be
a gross in.lustic> to lib to say that he
Is unfamiliar with California, affairs.
As . .utter of fact, he is most thor
oughly informed upon some of the
most important subjects that ever
agitated the people of California. As
Governor of Kentucky he became ac
quainted with Collis P. Huntingdon and
that great creature of the railroad
magnate, the Southern Pacific Com
pany of Kentucky.
In his official capacity Governor
Bradley learned very quickly to know
what Huntington wanted and what he
did not want in the way of legislative
enactments. During his term of office
Governor Bradley became thoroughly
familiar with the efforts of the Ken
tucky Legislature to abrogate the
charter of the Southern Pacific Com
pany of Kentucky. It is a matter of
congratulation to him perhaps and of
thanks for Huntington that the railroad
magnate received what he wanted and
the charter was not forfeited. Gov
ernor Bradley, as already Indicated, is
a lawyer of marked ability, and Hunt
ingdon enjoys the reputation of loving
those that love him. It is not improb
able that Governor Bradley will find
the "climate of San Francisco to his
â¢liking.
During his term of office Governor
Bradley saw the people of Kentucky
making strenuous efforts to force
Huntington to pay his just taxes as
other people who do not enjoy the
friendships of Governors are compelled
to do. The Southern Pacific Company
of Kentucky had the same conscien
tious scruples acainst paying its just
debts as the Southern Pacific Company
of this State. Suits were instituted by
theauthorities of Kentucky to force the
railroad to pay its just debts and back
taxes. There was a stubborn legal |
fight and one day Governor Bradley's
Attorney General. W. S. Taylor, com
promised with Huntinrton upon a 1
basis that made the great heart of the !
railroad magnate glad. This is why it
is that Governor Bradley may rank j
Collis P. Hunrington among his friends i
and why Kentucky's Governor may j
give San Francisco the best of it after
a critical observation of the city's in
adequacies.
"With the prnspert < f such a distin
guished addition to the legal frater
nity of San Francisco something of the
record of Governor Bradley's life may
not be uninteresting It may be that
the Governor may give us a few new
points in the law governing railroads
with a particular application to the
Southern Pacific.
governor Bradley was born in Ken
j tueky in IM7. At the age of 14 he en
j tered the Federal army and three years
later, by a special act of the Legisla
ture of his native State, he was ad
mitted to the bar. The American sup
plement of the Encyclopedia Britan
nica says he is a statesman. In 1870
he was elected a District Attorney and
in 1872 and 1576 he enjoyed the distinc
tion of being: defeated for Congress.
In 1880 he seconded the nomination of
U. S. Grant for President at the Chi
cago National Republican Convention.
President Arthur employed him to as
sist in prosecuting "star route" thieves,
and in 1887 he ran for Governor of
Kentucky and was defeated. In 1895
he was elected Governor and on De
cember 31 next his term will expire.
Shortly after his election he met Collis
P. Huntington and had the good for*
tune to merit the good will and active
friendship of the railroad magnate.

THE GAS RATE FIGHT.
San Francisco Gas and Electric Com
pany Probably Controls the
Situation*
To-day the Supervisors will take up and
consider the offer of the Mutual Electric
Light Company to light the City Hall at
a saving of 40 per cent. The majority re
port of the Finance Committee on the
matter of lighting, which, it is understood,
is satisfactory to the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company, will be read to
day and the understanding that the San
Francisco Company is satisfied with the
report may be taken as evidence that the
adoption of the report will leave that cor
poration in control of the situation.
This presumption is strengthened by
the laying over of the report of Engineer
Hunt, who holds that the city, by operat
ing its own electrical plant, can annually
save to the peoj^e the biff sum of $220,000,
THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL,, MONDAY, MARCH 27, 1899.
and the repudiation by the board of the
report of the minority of the Finance
Committee demanding a # reduction of the
light bills and gas rates for the future.
In any event a merry little debate is ex
pected to result.
AN INFLUENCE MANIFEST.
Changes May Be Made in the Fed
eral Building Plans.
It is very evident that some strong in
fluence from the Pacific Coast has been at
work among the officeholders at Washing
ton. At least a sudden change has taken
place in the mind of the supervising archi
tect having under his charge the plans
and specifications of the new Federal
building. Some time ago these plans were
sent to this city with a view of letting
local contractors prepare their bids for
the work in the several departments of
the structure. The first snag struck wad
on the construction of the floor in the
proposed building. The plans called for
a concrete floor throughout the building,
and at this the firm of Gladding. MoÃean
& Co. made a vigorous kick. They as
serted that the plans prevented them
from making a bid, as they deal only in
hollow tile materials, and the conorete
men would have a monopoly.
The firm wrote a letter or two to Super
vising Architect J. K. Taylor requesting
him to change the specifications sn that
alternate bids on this work would be
called lor. They also urged the Manu
facturers 1 and Producers' Association and
the Merchants' Association to take up the
fight in the interests of home products.
Hoth bodies sent to Washington urgent
letters indorsing the petition of the firm,
nnd in this they were joined by the
Chamber of Commerce.
A week ago the manufacturers received
a dispatch stating that no change would
be made, and on Friday the merchants
received a wire from Mr. Taylor, who
said: "It is not deemed wise to allow
terra cotta floor arches to be substituted
for the concrete construction in the San
Francisco Postoffice." This was followed
by a letter dated the 20th Inst.. giving a
few of the reasons for the decision set
forth in the dispatch. In the meantime
other influences were brought to hear, and
yesterday Captain Charles Nelson of the
Chamber of Commerce received a tele
gram from H. A. Taylor. Assistant Sec
retary, saying: "An addendum to the
specifications <>f the San Francisco Post
office will be prepared for bidders calling
Iternate bids on floor construction,
as you desire."

on more than one occasion quarreled with him and returned home, but again

ACCIDENTALLY SHOT
HIS FOSTER-SISTER
Joseph Miller Played Highwayman
With a Gun He Thought Not
Loaded.
Kitty Wannenmacher, a Fifteen-Year-Old Girl, Killed by
a Boy Her Parents Had Befriended â The Re=
morseful Youth Charged With Murder.
KITTY WANNBNMACHER, the
15-year-old daughter of Robert
Wannenmaoher, a butcher resid
ing at 405 Frederick street, was
accidentally shot and killed last
evening by Joseph Miller, a 19-yeur-old
boy. who lived with the Wannenmaoher
family. A rifle, that was not supposed
to he loaded, in the hands of a Btage
struek boy was the cause of the pathÂ»t-
SHOT DOWN BEFORE HER MOTHER'S EYES.
ic death of the pretty little 15-year-old
girl-
The accident occurred in the kitchen
shortly after the family had finished
the evening meal. Mrs. Wannenmacher
was pitting at one side of the table with
her 9-year-old son Reuben near her.
Opposite her was Kitty with a friend,
Ethel Kempster, seated at her left. Mr.
Wannenmacher was reading a paper in
an adjoining room, and Miller stood
near the table in the kitchen. The
Children wore about to go down into
the basement to read, as was their usu
al custom, and the conversation had
turned to Evans and Sontag. Young
Miller stepped to the door leading to the
basement, and seeing a rifle leaning
against the wall picked it up. and
pointing it at each of the persons in the
room inquired how he would look as a
highwayman. When the gun was point
ed at fithel Kempster she screamed
and said she was afraid it might be
loaded. Mrs. Wannenmacher laughed
at the fear of the child, and told her
that there was no cartridge in the gun,
as Mr. Wannenmacher always emptied
it when he brought it into the house.
Perceiving that Ethel Kempster was
the only one greatly frightened by his
action, Miller continued to point the
gun in her direction. Despite {he as
surance of Mrs. Wannenmacher that
the rifle was harmless without a shell
Ethel sought to hide behind the chair
of Kitty Wannenmacher. Following
her with the gun. Miller pulled the trig
ger and the ball struck Kitty.
The child called to her mother that
she was shot and then lost conscious
ness. Mr. Wannenmacher hearing the
report rushed into the kitchen, and
finding that his daughter was wounded
sent Miller for a physician. Dr. A. P.
Woodward who lives in the neighbor
hood, hastened to the Wannenmachers'
home. He found the girl unconscious
and breathing heavily. She was re
moved to the dining room and placed
on the table, where she died fifteen
minutes after the arrival of the doctor.
Sergeant Harper of the Stanyan
street Police Station was notified of
the occurrence by Miller and imme
diately went to the house. Coroner Hill
was communicated with, and after he
had personally investigated the shoot
ing decided that it was purely acci
dental and allowed the body to remain
at the home of the bereaved parents.
Miller was taken into custody by Ser
geant Harper and was charged with
murder at the Stanyan-street Police
Station. Later he was transferred to
the City Prison. He was full of re
morse on account of the* result of his
foolishly careless handling of the rifle
and â was inconsolable at the death of
his little playmate and the sorrow his
act had caused Mr. and Mrs. Wannen
marher, \flio had been his benefactors.
The boy was considered by Mr. and
Mrs. Wannenmacher almost as a son.
Four years ago young Miller's father
died and he, being thrown upon the
world, was taken in by the Wannen
machers. He worked about the house,
tended the horses and helped at the
butcher shop. His many good quali
ties, his willingness to- assist in the
work of the household and the grati
tude he showed for the kindness he re
ceived, soon endeared him to the en
tire family. Even last night after the
unfortunate accident the father and
mother of the dead girl had nothing
but kind things to say of the boy who
had caused them their Borrow.
Mr. Wannenmacher blames himself
to a certain extent for the accident on
account of the fact that the gun was
left loaded. The rifle is a 22 caliber
Ballarti with, a magazine which holds
sixteen cartridges. How the single
shell which was in the gun happened to
be there he cannot explain. He says
that a few days ago when he used the
i gun last he, as he supposed, ejected all
: the cartridges and stood it in the kitch
en. One of the shells he believes must
lhave caught in the magazine. The ball
slruok the child in the forehead about
an inch and a half above the left eye.
making a clean, round hole, and lodg
ed in the brain. But little blood flowed
from the wound, but it is the opinion
of Dr. Woodward that the hemorrhage
was internal.
The inquest Dr. Hill has set for 1
o'clock this afternoon, and it will be
held at the house.
