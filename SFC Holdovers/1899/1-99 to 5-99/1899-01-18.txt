VOLUME LXXXY-NO. 49.
STORY OF HOWARD WRIGHT'S DUPLICITY
TOLD TO THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE
SPEAKER WRIGHT HOLDS
HIS HIGH OFFICE WITHOUT
AUTHORITY OF THE LAWS
He Took a False Oath When He Swore to His Bill of
Election Expenditures.
THE LEGAL PENALTY PROVIDED IS FORFEITURE
Men Who Served as the Disgraced Official's Parity Committee Declare That They
Failed to Sign a Report of His Expenses as Required by the
Statutes â If Snch a Document Exists the Signa*
tares Are Forgeries.
The Call has now in its
possession evidence to
prove that Howard E.
Wright, Speaker of the
Assembly, is guilty of of
fenses that, under the law,
are punishable by heavy
penalties. There is no
necessity to elaborate on
the nature of the felony
that Wright has commit
ted nor any need to char
acterize further the ethics
of this man, who has, by
his public acts, disgraced
himself, betrayed his
friends and constituents
and outraged the decency
of the State. Mr. Wright,
by the authority of his
own oath, is a perjurer.
Among the official docu
ments of Alameda County
is the record of his lying
oath.
The Call also charges
that Howard E. Wright is
either a forger, an acces
sory to a forgery or a vio-
lator of the legal conditions
under which he was elected
to the Assembly. Mr.
Wright has sworn to a
false oath in his state-
ment of his election ex
penses. He has therefore
; : forfeited, under the law,
his right to the seat which
he has dishonored in the
Assembly. He did not se
cure the signatures of the
committee which, the law
of the State prescribes,
must audit his election ex-
penses.
The report of that com
mittee is not on file in the
office of the Secretary of
State, where the law de-
Clares it shall be. If any
document, purporting to
be a report of the purity
committee, exists, and is
signed, the signatures are
forgeries, and Mr. Wright,
for a second reason, has
submitted himself to the
penalty of a forfeiture of
his seat in the Assembly
and to prosecution for a
guilty participation in a
felony. These are accusa
tions which, in the proof,
raise Howard E. Wright to
the evil dignity of a public
malefactor.
The facts upon the foundation of
which The Call prefers these serious
charges against the Speaker of the As
sembly may best be stated chronologic
ally. Mr. Wright and WHllam B.
Prlrigle were rivals for the Republican
nomination to the Assembly in the
Fifty-first District. The Republican
nomination was equivalent to an elec-
tion, and the contestants knew Jt.
Every energy therefore was given to
wtn at the primary election. On the
*v* of that election Wright realized
The San Francisco Call.
that Prinele had given him a strong '
battle and on the following day might
assemble the more powerful force at
the polls.
Wright and some of his friends
sought and obtained therefore a con- j
ferenre w-ith Pringle. The fight of
Prank C. Jordan for County Clerk of i
Alameda was involved and Pringle. |
who was Jordan's friend, and fearful of |
the antagonistic influence of Wright, ]
agreed to withdraw. Wright promised
to pay Pringle $250 to pay, in part at j
least, what Pringle had expended In j
the campaign. On the following day, j
the day of the primary election, Wright
gave Pringle $250 in coin.
Two farts in that transaction are
significant. It should not be furgotten |
that Wright subsequently took a legal j
oath that he spent no more than $74 to j
secure his election. It should be re- j
membered that Pringle and his friends
and also the friends of Wright, under- i
j stood thoroughly that Wright was not j
paying his own money to Pringle. On j
I the night of the conference Wright de
clared that he did not have the money,
â¢ but would give it to Pringle on the foi
lowing day. Wright had not yet found
lan angel in Milton J. Green. The
friends of Wright winked knowingly
j when he paid the money and some
! body said the railroad building cast a
long shadow. Wherever the money
; came fn/m Wright was prompt in pay
ment.
He was profuse also in promise, al
though he was treading close upon the
interdicted domain of the law. He told
Pringle that he would use his influence
j to secure for Pringle a position at the
Legislature worth $6 a day, or a Fed
i eral or State appointment that the re
i tiring aspirant might seek. Pringle was
: at liberty to accept the $6 for himself
â  or for any one else of his choosing.
1 Pringle had set his cap for the secre
i taryshin of the California Code Com
mission, and Wright nodded approval.
That concluded the negotiations
through which Wright secured his
nomination for the Assembly. He con
â  strued one of the transactions to mean
the corruption of his friend Pringle.
| Over three times the amount that
Wright swore was his expenditure had
already been spent and an illegal prom
ise had been given. But Wright had
only begun his campaign. The Call is
in a position to prove that Wright ex
pended after his nomination and be
fore his election the sum of $100 that
was used exclusively for election pur
poses. This sum was not spent per
sonally by Wright, but was given by
him to be used in his political interest.
; This money was not accounted for In
j the sworn statement of expenditures
i that Wright subsequently made.
The Speaker of the Assembly is
' therefore guilty of perjury and subject
I under the law to a forfeiture of his
{ seat. The statute permits no discre
i tion in the matter and provides es
i pecially for the penalty.
When Howard E. Wright was noml
' nated for the Assembly he appointed
I the following to act as his auditing
' committee under the purity of elections
j law: W. B. Pringle, Frank Parcells,
'â  William H. Waste, Arthur Elston and
H. S. Pugh. This committee is com
: manded by law to supervise the elec
i tion expenses of the candidate it repre
sents and to make oath that the
! amount finally sworn to Is correct.
I Each member of the committee must
! sign the document under oath. The re
j port, in the case of legislative officers,
is then filed with the Secretary of
State. Many officers have also filed the
reports of their purity committees with
! the Recorders of their counties as a
I matter of double security. There is a
provision In the law that invalidates
the election of an officer If the report
j of the purity committee be not properly
I and honestly made and filed.
The records of this State fail to re
veal the existence of a report by
Pringle, Parcells, Waste, Elston and
Pugh in favor of Howard E. Wright.
Such a report Bhould be in
the office of the Secretary of
' State, but It is not there, and there is
I nothing to show- that it ever was there.
The greatest diligence has been exer
cised in a search for this report, but it
cannot be found. It might have been
in the office of the Recorder of Ala
meda County or that of the County
Clerk, but it is in neither. These facts
In themselves would be dangerous to
Howard E. Wright, but there is in
connection with this affair another fact
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1899.
that Is fatal to the Speaker of the As
sembly.
The purity committee appointed by
Howard E. Wright has not signed a re
port of his election expenditures as pro
vided by law, and the penalty is the
forfeiting of the seat that the Speaker
now occupies. If there Is anywhere In
existence a document which purports
to be such a report at least three of the
signatures are forgeries.
In discussing this most serious affair
last night H. S. Pugh, one of the mem
bers of the committee, minced no
words. "I neither saw nor signed a
report of expenditures for Wright,"
said >fr. Pugh. "If such a report is in
existence and my name is attached to
it the signature is a forgery. If the
names of at least two of my associates
on that committee are attached to such
a document these signatures also are
forgeries.
"We never signed the report for the
simple reason that it was never pre
sented to us by Wright. We had our
own private affairs to attend to and
since he did not concern himself with
what was naturally of importance to
himself we did not do so. That is all
I know about the affair."
No further evidence is necessary to
prove that Howard E. Wright Is not
entitled to his seat in the Assembly.
He was not legally elected to the posi
tion and the Statutes provide what the
consequences shall be.
In discussing the same affair Frank
Parcells said:
"I did sign one document for Howard
Wright. I did not know I was on his
purity committee until one day I re
ceived a document from him by mail.
I was informed that it was necessary
to sign it so that it could be filed in
time, and I was asked to deliver it to
A. W. Bishop, which I did. It may
seem careless, but I did not look at the
nature of the document other than to
see that it had some signatures upon
it, and then, being in a hurry. I signed
it. I suppose it was his election ac
count, but of this I am not certain. It
may have been a certificate of nomi
nation. In any event I did not super
vise any of his expeditures and know
nothing about his expenses."
GREEN'S STATEMENT
PREDICATED ON A LIE
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 17.â Milton J. Green to
night gave to the press the following
interview:
"I did not hear the testimony given
by Mr. Leake of The Call before the
Assembly Investigating Committee,
and therefore have no opportunity of
denying certain statements made by
him. I have just been told that he tes
tified I had either said to him or to
Speaker Wright that I had given
money to Senator Cutter and Assem
blymen Jilson and Raw. I desire to
denounce this statement as an absolute
and unqualified lie.
Mr. Leake did not testify that Green
had said "To him or to Speaker Wright
that I (Green) had given money to
Senator Cutter and Assemblymen Jil
son and Raw." What Mr. Leake did
testify to was to the effect that Wright
had asked him if he had heard of Sena
tor Cutter receiving financial assistance
in his campaign and if he had heard of
Assemblymen Jilson and Raw receiv
ing assistance in their fight for elec
tion. Mr. Leake testified that he had
heard that they had been, but did not
testify that Wright gave Green as his
authority for the assertion. Mr. Leake
distinctly stated in his testimony that
Mr. Green had only told him of the as
sistance he had given Howard E.
Wright and Raw.
When Mr. Leake heard that Mr.
Green had given his interview to the
press he promptly laid before Green the
facts as to what he did testify to and
clearly demonstrated that Green's in
terview was founded on a misstate
ment on what his evidence really was.
Mr. Green admits that he did not hear
Mr. Leake's testimony, but based his
interview on statements made to Sena
tor Cutter by an outsider. Mr. Green
insisted on sending out the interview
to the press even after it was shown
to him that it was predicated on a lie.
The verbatim report of the testimony
appearing in this issue of The Call
shows exactly what Mr. Leake testified
to as far as Assemblymen Raw and
Jilson and Senator Cutter are con
cerned. The verbatim report Is ldentl
cal with the official stenographic rec
ord of the testimony.
BURNS' PLAN IS TO
BLOCK LEGISLATION
CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 17.â Three ballotÃ for
United States Senator were taken to-day
and no special significance was attached
to either. The followers of Burns made
an effort to prevent the adjournment of
the Joint convention, but the motive of the
resistance was plain. It Is now the Burns
programme to block legislation and pun
ish the legislators. The members who
recognize that the prospect of agreement
is remote are willing to meet daily, as the
constitution of the United States requires,
and to take at least one ballot. Many
members who hold that the business of
the Legislature should proceed favor a
plan of going ahead with such legisla
tion as the interests of the State demand.
It is not essential that more than one
hour's time a day should be occupied in
the session of the joint convention. Tne
touts are not willing there should be any
thing in the Legislature but pulling and
hauling over the Senatorial struggle. By
holding fast to such a programme they
expect to wear out the patience of the
people and force a caucus.
The Call intends that the people shall
know the plans of the Burns push. It
would not be a great misfortune to the
State if the Legislature should adjourn
without electing a United States Sena
tor, but it would be a lasting disgrace
to the commonwealth if Burns were cho
sen to represent California in the Senate
of the United Btates.
When the contest is narrowed down to
a question of endurance the people can
hold out as long as the touts can afford
.to remain in Sacramento. Meanwhile
leading members. of the Republican party
who made the victory for the State ticket
possible may call D. M. Burns, Major Mc-
Laughlin, J. Alva Watt and Paris Kil
burn to account â  for making a claim at
Sacramento to represent the party. The
Republican State Central , Committee is
not in favor of Dan Burns for Senator.
The establishment of State committee
headquarters in the Golden Eagle Hotel
to boost Burns ought to be rebuked by
Republican voters In every county of the
State.
The Republican State . Central Commit
tee ought to meet in San Francisco and
quickly call off Major. McLaughlin, Paris
Kilburn and Alva Watt. â¢ â¢ â _
They have the right of individuals. to be
here and support the candidate ,of their
choice, but they have no business or color
of, right, to represent the r Republican or
ganization of California. They know as
well as any fact can be surmised that If
-the question*" of selecting a> sufoesaor no-
Stephen M. .White could be submitted, to
a popular ,: vote '-â '. in California *- nine
tenths of the Republicans J would pro
nounce against- Dan Burns. ;â  \. ;
The booflling of Grant's 1 agents is no
more despicable than the :. fraudulent
methods i employed by j the touts to pre
vent an honest expression on the part of
the . representatives of the people. â¢ The
discipline that the major needs should be
administered by the stalwart voters be
longing to the Republican party and they
represent quite a respectable majority of
the tapayers of California. The use of
Dan Burns of the .Republican head
quarters in the Palace Hotel at San
Francisco was sufficiently repulsive â  to
disgust many earnest and high-minded
Republicans, who contributed of their
means and energies to make â¢ the great
victory for the people possible. When
Burns and Mclaughlin come to Sacra
mento and set up the claim they control
the party organization their assumption
demands rebuke. ....
The Democrats in the Legislature - to
day saw the Burns scheme to. block busi
ness by prolonging, the session of the Joint
assembly. When the roll call was de
manded on the proposition to adjourn
after the third ballot had been taken
Senator Ashe voted to adjourn. His
example was followed by other Demo
crats. The touts fancy that opposition
to adjourn may delude some people with
the notion that Burns has strength In re
serve which he intends to call at some
particular ballot, but this talk of reserved
strength is a bluff. Conditions may
arise by which Burns would be able to
line up three of four men who are not at
present in his camp, but be is well advised
that he cannot win as long as Republicans
refuse to go into caucus. 'â â  .. â  . -
Under the cover of a secret ballot In
caucus Burns . might disclose more
strength than he can rally in the open.
When it comes to underhanded, low-down
political jobbery, knavery and chincanery
the touts can give odds to anybody in
Grant's camp. â  Grant has a bigger sack
to go down in than Burns ever had. al
though hints are thrown out that Can
delaria is richer than ever and if the col
onel was prepared to enter upon a cam
paign of bribery and corruption; he could
buy up everything in sight. . Much of- the
talk about Burns' wealth is ; airy non
sense The sums accredited to him v as
contributions to the Republican cause
were given by others. â¢ ,The mainstay of
Burns at this time is the patronage. The
Impression is spread abroad that Gov
ernor Gage intends to recognize only such
claimants as the major and the colonel
recommend as- worthy. While the Gov
ernor has no sympathy or respect for the
Grant candidacy, he is not going to sur
render the management of State affairs to
the touts. It may be all right in politics
for the touts. to hold out the promise that
Gage intends to recognize them and -their
friends alone, but the Governor will have
something to say when the â¢appointments
arc made to positions under his adminis
tration. " â â¢-.â¢- ", â  : : . ;

[Extract from Green's testimony before the investigating committee.] '
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 17.â The story of How
ard E. Wright's degradation was told
to-night to the Assembly committee
appointed to investigate the charges
made against him by The Call.
The whole unlovely truth was told
as It had previously been confessed
by Wright. Then Milton J. Green, po
litical manager of the Senatorial cam
paign of U. S. Grant, retold the stOTy
and added to it details that had been
overlooked, forgotten or suppressed by
Wright.
In a word, the Investigating commit
tee has now Indisputable evidence that
Howard E. Wright, Speaker of the As
sembly, received $1650 from U. S. Grant
through his agent, Milton J. Green, In
return for a promise and Implicit un
derstanding that Wright would support
Grant for United States Senator.
To be sure, the story as told by
Green was not told willingly. The de
tails of the bargain were dragged
from him by bits. He was a reluctant
witnesÃ and his testimony was marked
by a cloud of reluctant evasions, out of
whicll the questioners with great diffi
culty extracted fragments of the truth,
until, by piecing them together, the
facts as they exist were displayed to
all.
It was not a pleasant tale, to hear. It
no more nor less than a relation of
how a man whose ambition leads him
to seek a high position is seeking to
gratify that ambition by corrupting
legislators.
Milton J. Green is the manager of
U. S. Grant's Senatorial campaign. He
is the man who handled the money that
was paid to Howard E. Wright. He
admitted to-night under oath that the
money paid to Wright was Grant's
money, and that it was money provided
by Grant for the purpose of promoting
his Senatorial campaign. There is
nothing left to be told. The Call's
charges have been substantiated by the
sworn testimony of the man who han
dled the money, and by one of the per
sona to whom Wright confessed the
truth.
When the Investigating committee
met this afternoon the great throng of
legislators and spectators in attend
ance testified to the deep interest the
Investigation is attracting here.
Assemblyman Meade of Los Angeles,
who Is one of the two minority mem
bers of the committee, appeared before
the committee and stated that he would
refuse to serve. He gave no reason for
his declination, but said that if his
resignation was not accepted there
would be a vacancy on the committee,
as he would not attend its sessions.
It was decided to report the matter to
the Assembly. The suggestion of
Committeeman Sanford, recommending
that Assemblyman Burnett be ap
pointed in Meade's place, was adopted.
Formal proceedings were instituted
by Chairman Cosper by calling U. S.
Grant to the witness stand. Walter R.
Bacon, a Los Angeles attorney, an
nounced that he appeared for Grant.
He protested against the decision of the
committee to place Grant on the stand
as the first witness and declared that
his client was not accused and was
therefore not called upon to make a de
fense. Mr. Bacon was Informed that
there was no desire on the part of the
committee to make Mr. Grant a de
fendant, but that it was deemed proper
to take his testimony in order to make
a proper investigation of the charges
made by The Call against Speaker
Wright.
Garret McEnerney, who, with E. S.
Pillsbury, appeared on behalf of The
Call, asked the indulgence of the com
mittee to make a statement. He said
The Call having made the charges
stood ready to substantiate them, but
that in order to do so, to the satisfac
tion of the committee and to the best
interests of the Legislature and the peo
ple of the State, The Call should be
permitted tn produce its evidence and
call its witnesses in such manner as
should be dictated by a full knowledge
of the facts. This was opposed by
Committeeman Melllck, who Bald he
was afraid that the time of the com
mittee would be taken up with useless
: questioning and legal argument. His
mind was set at rest on this point by
Mr. McEnerney, who declared that if
he were permitted to call witnesses In
order he would agree to get at the
heart of the matter so expeditiously
that there would be no cause for com
plaint. This view of the matter was
taken by a majority of the committee
and It was agreed that Mr. McEnerney
should be allowed to proceed In his own
way.
When Mr. McEnerney asked that
Speaker Wright be called as the first
w?tness It developed that he had not
retn subpoenaed. After a delay of a
half hour, the sergeant at arms suc
ceeded In finding Mr. Wright. When
he appeared before the committee he

said he was not prepared to take the
witness stand and give his testimony,
as he had had no opportunity to con
sult with his attorneys. He also said
he was awaiting the arrival of impor
tant papers. By consent nf Mr. Mc-
Entrney and Mr. Pillshury, Wright was
excused until the evening session. The
committee then adjourned until 7:30
o'clock in the evening.
When the committee reassembled
some discussion was had as to how far
the attorneys for interested parties
were to be permitted to participate in
the proceedings. The question vis
filially settled by the introduction and
ackption of a resolution to the effect
that the course of the investigation
should be directed by the committee.
The first witness called was W. S.
L.cake, manager of The Call. He tes
tified in detail as to conversations had
by him with Wright and Green, the
subject-matter of which has been pub
lished in these columns, and formed rhe
basis of the charge against Wright.
The next witness was Milton J. Green.
Ths substance of what he testified to
has been outlined in the foregoing par
agraphs. A verbatim report of all the
testimony given, as well as all dis
cussion before the committee, will be
found in another place in this paper.
A careful perusal of it will prove in
teresting to those persons who have
looked with incredulity upon the
charges made against Speaker Wright.
BELSHAW'S BILL AS
AMENDED WILL PASS
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.â Senate bill 199
by Cutter of Yuba County will pass tha
Assembly with two slight amendments.
This was decided by the Republican ma
jority in caucus this afternoon. The
amendements are that there shall be four
assistant minute clerks, instead of two as
In the bill, and that all appointments
shall lie over for a day on the journal,
in order that they may be investigated.
As the bill stands now there will be thirty
odd new employes, with an added daily
expense of about $113 more than under
the Belshaw act. The bill was presented
in caucus by Assemblyman Valentine of
Los Angeles and was practically agreed
to by Belshaw, but he wanted to tack
on as an amendment that if any further
employes were to be hired it should only
be done by a four-fifths vote.
The caucus would not stand for It, and
Belshaw with a large following bolted the
proceeding. They filed out of the court
room where the caucus was being held
into the Capitol rotunda and flatly refused
to go any further with the matter until it
Is introduced in the Assembly, when they
propose to fight it to a standstill. Bel
shaw claims that after he and his sup
porters bolted there was not a quorum
left in the caucus and that any subse
quent action was void. He refuses to be
bound by Its action, and claims that none
other of the members are, and is getting
ready for a bitter fight when the bill
comes up to-morrow- after the charter ha*
been considered.2

The chairmanâ "You have heard the re
marks of Mr. Meaue. Have you any ac
tion that should be taken thereon? I sup
we have no jurisdiction, Mr. Meade.
I think there ought to be a report to the
Asr-- nibly."
Mr. Lardnerâ "l would simply report
him."
Mr. Sanfordâ "Simply report that Mr.
refuses to Berve, and that we ask
that Mr. Burnett be appointed."
Mr. Lardnerâ "Just repori the fact, and
let him do as .c pleases, i move, Mr.
Chairman, that thffl be reported by the
chairman of this committee to the Speak

Mi. Mellickâ "l move as an amendment
to that that we recommend that the

that Mr. Burnett has consented to serve."
Mr. LaÃareeâ "l Becond that motion of

Mr. Mellickâ "I will second hia motion,
In order to get it before the com

The chairmanâ "lt is moved and second
ed that the declination of Mr. Meade to

an amendment offered that the declina

the amendment. Ail- there any re

Mr. Lardnerâ "l think. Mr. Chairman,
that it Is out of our province to recom

should simply report the fact and let the

In view of the fact thai Mr. (&

only be right that this committee make
it known to the Hod--, as it was not
thoroughly Btated before the House this
morning. " I do not see how it would be
out of the province of the committ* â¢ to
simply make that request to the Houpp."
The amendment to the original motion
was put by the chairman and was car
lied: the motion as amended was also
carried.
Mr. CoÃperâ "lt is well, perhaps, to an
nounce that the committee has done the
best it could, through the sergeant-at
arms, to secure a more comfortable room
for our occupancy during this investiga
tion; but, for the present, we arc told
that it is impossible to do any better than
we have, and the session this afternoon
will have to be held in this room. You
will need to look with care to the bulle
tin board to learn where our meetings
are to be held, because they are not likely
to be held In this room. It is too small
and too confining. What is the further
pleasure of the committee?" .%
The chairmanâ "Will Mr. Ulysses S.
Grant Jr. kindly take the witness Btand?
We will supply a place for him over
here."
Mr. Baconâ "Mr. Chairman, I will ap
pear for Mr. Grant in this matter. My
name is Bacon, from Los Angeles â W.
R. Bacon. I understand you. Mr. < 'hair
man, that the committee is not full?"
The chairman â "We lack one member."
Mr. Baffin- "Pn you propose to pro
ceed with the Investigation prior to com
pleting your committee?'*
The chairmanâ "l think so."
Mr. Baconâ "On behalf of Mr. Grant,
who is subpenaed here as a witness, we
would like very much to have the chair
man make a statement, or the commit
tee make a statement, defining the scope
that this investigation will take â as to
whether there is any specific charge that
they propose to investigate, or whether
they propose to investigate the whole
campaign that has been made in this
fitate. We simply desire it from this fact:
that If there is a definite, specific charge
to be investigated of course the witnesses
in this matter will be very much fewer
in number than if the entire campaign
were gone Into; and for that purpose we
would like to know a little something
about it, so as to prepare ourselves for
that event."
The chairmanâ "l will say to the com
mittee and to Mr. Bacon that the matter
is in a somewhat nebulous condition in
my own mind, but under the resolution
it seems to me that it is within the
province of the committee, if it sees fit,
to investigate all the transactions with
reference to the candidacy of any person
for United States Senator before the
present Legislature, and it is my judg
ment that that will be the course taken.
Has that defined It sufficiently for you?"
Mr. Baconâ "Yes, sir. Now. if that Is
the case, it seems to me, Mr. Chairmanâ
as 1 understand it this resolution was In
troduced by Mr. Johnson, and in his pre
amble to the resolution he says that there
have* been charges made of improper con
duct. Now, it seems to me that it would
be proper in first put before your rnm
niittee fÂ»me charge of improper doings
on the part of some Senatorial candidate
<t::>l then those candidates can be sub
penaed here to refute those charges. It
seems to me that it would be a very pe
culiar state of affairs if a candidate for
United States Senate can b>' brought up
before, a committee of this kind and have
the conduct of his campaign Investigated
Without there bring the least charge that
there is anything wrong about his cam
paign. Ami we desire, in a spirit of fair
ness and in justice to' Mr. Grant to ob
ject to Mr. Grant being the first witness
In tin's case- for the reason that there is
lutelyâ 60 far as this committee is
rued â no charge here of any im
proper conduct of this campaign. Now,
as 1 understand it. Mr. chairman and
gentlemen of the committee, I do not
think there is any question but that it is
public property, and it is already conced
< d by the public to be a fact, that these
resolutions grew out of a- certain article
in the San Francisco Call. It seems to
me that Mr. I.cake, the managing editor
â I Tfre Call, should be put upon the stand
and substantiate his charges- or make
Bay what Mr. "Wright said
to him, or what Mr. Grant said to him,
or what somebody sail! to him, that led
him to believe that something improper
had been done in this campaign. And I
appeal to you. gentlemen, that it is not
fair and it Lowers* the dignity of y.uir
committee t" ask Mr. ("riant to be put
upon the stand .lure to refute something
that lie knows nothing about. I ask you.
gentlemen, in a spirit of fairness, that
you put somebody upon the stand to say
something that will indicate to you that
there has been a wrong committed."
Mr. McEnerneyâ "Mr. Chafrraan, I
would like to have the permission of the
committee to address it for a few min
utes.? 1
The chairmanâ "Your name."
Mr. McEnei^ieyâ "Garret McEnerney."
The chairmanâ "You have mv permi;
sion.",
Mr. McEnerneyâ "Mr. E. S. Pillsbury and
I appear here for Mr. John D. Spreckels,
proprietor of The Call, and Mr. W. S.
Leake, the managing editor. The resolu
tion adopted by the House of which you
â¢men are members recites that-cer
tain charges have been made, a? Mr
i Bacon has already stated, it is common
prop* rty that those charges -were made in
'; The Call. We expected to address the
cornmiu-eo b'fore it outlines the procedure
which it bad determined to follow and to
â¢ Bt that inasmuch, as the charge was
by men who occupy positions of
prominence and financial stability in the
it may be readily presumed that
they are familiar with some of the facts
by which' the charges could be proven.
and if it were the sense of your commit
teeâwhich presumably has no information
about the matter and which is to sit here
with no preconceived notions about the
matter and no prior knowledgeâ to permit
us to put in proof to substantiate our
charges and let us bring out the facts
with directness and with expedition, the
eding could be brought to an early
close. If it was found, after a short period
of time, that we were wasting the time of
the committee it could take the matter
iin r.f our hands. It seems to us that,
I having, as we claim, the facts within our
knowledge, which the committee does not
possess, better results could be ac
i compllshed by asking us to establish the
I charges if we are able."
The chairmanâ "l will say to the gen
tlemen that this committee is not a court
trying specific charges, because, as has
well been said, no specific chargesâ at
least, no written chargesâ have been
plat ed before this committee. It is a com
| mittee of investigation, and I am quite
; willing, on my part, as chairman of the
committee, to submit the matter as
to the course to be pursued to the
committee, and, indeed, I raised that
tlon last evening. In our first meeting.
but the matter was left undecided, as I
thought, and I will hear any suggestions
; from the committee upon the proposi
; tion."
Mr Mellickâ "l want to say for my part
that I am absolutely opposed to the at
torneys of anybody coming here and run
ning this matter. If The Call wants to
establish its charges so that it won't
njeed to carry tlx-m out in the courts I
am dead, opposed to that. If they have
be"en sued for libol-if they want to es
tabllsh any line of argument or any fact.s
it is their business in the courts, not here.
As far as Mr. Bacon is concerned, In his
talk I am wiiiiiiK tot 1 1 1 * - attorneys to go
; this far before this committee, and thai
is: When there is a witness on the stand
then, of course, he has the right to ad
vice from an attorney, but I am not in
I favor of having an attorney step in here
! and dictate to this committee what it
fhall do, or suggest even. We are hero
appointed to investigate this ourselves,
j and. by the Eternal, for one I want to
investigate! I don't want attorneys to
step in here and ask this question nor
that question and stop us In It. My ex
perience In the last session was the attor
neys, one side and the other, would come
in hore an<! they- would offer this sugges
tion and that, and until we banished at
torneys, except as advisers for any par
ticular witness, we made no progress;
and I am in favor of following that pro
cedure now. We know what we are after.
Let us go directly and get it without re
gard to any attorneys for any party."
Mr. Baconâ "Mr. Chairman, I certainly
I do not desire to make any suggestion at
all as to any procedure. I simply, in the
first place, ask for information as to
: what procedure you propose to adopt.
Mr. Mellick will grant me this: that Mr.
Grant Is acandidate for I'nited States Sen
ator, a high and honorable position, and
he should not be, by any committee, put
in a position of defending himself
against a charge that is not for
mulated. There never has been a com
mittee in the Houses of Congress, nor in
a Legislature, that I ever heard of that
would not allow a man who is charged
with doing something wrong a chance
to be represented by himself and by an
attorney." .
Mr. Mellickâ "Mr. Bacon, let me answer
that.". . . . .
Mr. Baconâ "Well."
Mr. Mellickâ "Your suggestion is a good
one. I think there is no question that at
torneys very often get into a committee
meeting of this kind and seek to divert it
from its proper channel. That is not my
idea, at all. We are here at this investi
gation, but what we. want to know Is what
we are investigating."
The chairmanâ "Your contention, if I
understand you, Mr. Bacon, is that there
should be formulated charges made be
fore this committee."
Mr. Baconâ "No, sir; not formulated
charges. We don't want any informa
tion or any indictment, or anything of
that kind written out: but what we want
Is to have somebody get un in this com
mittee room and say that something
wrong has , been done. That is all we
want. It seems to me it is one of the
most simple requests ever made."
The chairmanâ "How would It then be
properly denominated an investigating
committee?"
Mr. Baconâ "Why, what are you inves
tigating?"
The chairmanâ "We are Investigating
whether a wrong has been done."
Mr. Bacnnâ "investigating whether a
I wrong has been done. Now, as I have
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1899.
snld, and as Mr. McKnemey has said,
there is no questionâ l don't think there
is any doubt in the minds of the members
of this investigating committeeâ the_
charge is founded upon the fact that there
was a charge in tne newspaper of im
proper conduct."
Mr. Mellickâ "l will help you out as to
how I am willing to go ahead, as a mem
ber-of this committee. For instance, if
the chairman calls Mr. Grant, we put
him on here and we ask uÂ»m a question;
you, as his attorney, can object to
that question.; and, as far as â¢ I
am concerned, I am willing 'to
have you state your views before the
committee; but then we can decide, under
the resolutipn, whether we are asking
proper questions or not. We are not trj
ing to shut you out as an attorney and
adviser of Mr. Grant, except when, in
tlie investigation we ask a certain ques
tion. Then you can decide or you can
argue whether it Is a proper question
under this resolution or hot. But we have
got to go right in auU do something."
Mr. Baconâ "Well, I cannot help but
see, Mr. Chairman and other members of
the committee, that it could not be any
thing but proper to start this investiga
tion in a logical way."
Mr. Mellickâ "Who decides what is
logical?"
Mr. Baconâ "You do. T am not decid
ing. 1 am simply making the suggesfion
that that would be the logical way to do
It; have somebody come in here and make
a statement of something done Improp
erly; and then, if there is no such state
ment made, there is no need for any in
vestigation."
The chairmanâ "Your idea, then, would
be that a charge be made."
Mr Baconâ "No, sir; I don't say that."
The, chairmanâ "That counsel for the
person supporting the charge should, in
vestigate and offer his testimony in sup
port of that charge, and the other side â
the other partiesâ must bring testimony
to prove the. falsity of the charge. Is
that right?"
Mr. Baconâ "Mr. Chairman, my posi
tion is simply this: that that article in
The Call stands in just exactly the same
stead as an indictment. Now. if you were
in a court of justice, or anywhere, on
earth where the ordinary rules of evi
dence obtain, the first procedure is to sub
stantiate the charges. Why is it unfair,
why is it unbusinesslike, to do that?"-
The chairmanâ "lt looks to me as if
this committee is a unique committee in
one respect, that it has not a likeness to
a courtâ not a general likeness, more in
the likeness of a grand jury in its in
vestigation of any supposed "wrong, and
that the procedure that has grown up in
tlie practice of the courts is not such a
procedure as will affect the purposes of
this investigation. If the committee, any
of them, feel differently about the matter,
I will be glad to hear from them."
Mr. l.ardnerâ "Mr. Chairman, as an at
torney. 1 know but one way to get at
these matters. If there is a charge made
let those who make the charge attempt
to substantiate it, and then those who
deny the ( hargc attempt to refute it. I do
not know how to get at it in any other
way."
The chairmanâ "The difficulty about the
matter is that we have no specific
charge."
Mr. Lardnerâ "Well, there must be a
plaintiff and defendant, one way or the
otherâ or an affirmative and a negative."
Mr. McEnerneyâ "l would like to inquire
if there is a copy of the resolution before
the committee?"
The chairmanâ "Yes. Would you like
to hear it read?"
Mr. McEnerneyâ "l will ' read It. The
first paragraph of the preamble, Mr.
Â« "hairman, is:
Whereas, Direct charges have been made that
Improper means have been used to Influence the
action of the Hon. Howard E. Wright, a mem
ber of and Speaker of the Assembly, In the
election .of a United States Senator by the
Legislature, and whereas, it has been charged
that some persons have used and are using il
legal methods to influence the action of mem
bers of the Assembly in said election, and
whereas, etc.
"Now, it serais to me that those two
paragraphs carry a charge. The Clients
whom Mr. Plllslmry and myself represent
have made the charges."
The chairmanâ "Let me call your atten
tion, Mr. MeEnerney, to this proposition:
That the preamble to those resolutions
speaks about a charge."
Mr. McÃnerneyâ "Yes, sit."
The chairman â"But that no tocfl
charge, so far as this committee may
know and so far as the members thermf
may know personally, has been made to
the Assembly." 1
Mr. McE-nerneyâ "That is- true. But tlue
Assembly, in the exercise of that inherent
power which it possesses, to preserve the
integrity of the body as such and its
members, has taken notice of a public
charge of that character, and this com
mittee has met to hear and determine
those matters. Now, the charge has been
made by certain individuals. Those cer
tain individuals claim to be able to sub
stantiate the charge. This committee does
not know by whom the, charges can be
substantiated; it does not know that they
can be substantiated by Mr. Grant or by
Mr. "Wright or by Mr. Green or any one
else. The charges having been made by
the clients whom we represent, they are
the sole owners and in the possession of
facts which would enable the proof of
those facts to be expeditionsly brought
forward. Of course, 1 have no" desnre to
take issue with Mr. Mellick about the re
sults of interference by attorneys In com
mittees. Portions of these charges, as
they are set forth in these resolutions, are
specific in character. For centuries the
way to prove facts has been for me man
who makes the allegation to bring for
ward the proof, and that experience in
the courts has commended itself to the
judgment of mankind generally. Of
course, we have no desire to intrude our
selves into this controversy; but having
made the charges, our clients deem it
their duty to appear before the committee
and to say that they are in possession of
the evidence wherc-by those charges can
be proven, and if the committee will give
usa short time to make a beginning, then
if we consume unnecessarily and fruit
lessly the time of the committee you can
drive us out of the room."
The chairmanâ "Tour suggestion is a
kin<l one. What does the committee think
(if it? I understand you, Mr. McEnerney,
to propose this line of procedure: That
yourselves, representing The < 'all and the
men who made this charge through The
â¢ 'all, desire t'i present to this committee
evidence In support of the charges that
have been talked about in this resolu
tion?"
Mr. McKnerneyâ "Yi'S, sir. To proceed
just as though it were a civil action,
where the burden of proof was upon the
person making the charge, calling what
witnesses we please and conducting the
examination under the direction of the
committee. , Of course, if we waste the
time, why, 'the committee will not toler
ate us. It Is undoubtedly true that it
needs no formal charge to set an investi
gating committee in motion. That has
been repeatedly decided in the courts.
The Legislature, for the purpose of pre
serving, as I said before, the integrity of
the body and its members, is in duty
bound to taken notice of charges reflect
ing upon either. And it could set in mo
tion, and it has the right in this proceÂ«d
lng to set in motion and conduct the in
quiry without the aid or co-operation or
assistance of those who claim to be in
possession of the facts. But supposing
that we made the charge upon the state
ment made by Mr. Grantâ the committee
would not know that Mr. Grant had ever
made the statement. It would not go
upon the particular item of proof we
founded the charge against him, and it
would go on, it seems to me, consuming
more time that would be consumed under
the plan as is suggested here."
Mr. Mellickâ "But, Mr. McEnerney, your
attention is called to the fact that we are
not investigating The Call's charges alone.
There are other charges; and if we jiurn
it over to you to carry out a certain line
of procedure that you have in your mind
the first thing we know the committee is
carried away with your line of action.
You will naturally carry your line of. ac
tion Into what you expect to follow In the
courts and get your facts established
here. Now, I am not particular whether
we take Mr. Grant or somebody else; take
Mr. Ltake or somebody else. But we are
not willing that you Call people should
come here and outline a policy for us and
say whether they shall delay or hurry
the proceedings. We are here simply as
a grand jury, and not as in a civil action.
We are here, as Mr. Cosper, the chair
man, says, as a grand jury to investigate
these facts, and it is our business to go
right after them."
Mr MelCnerneyâ "Mr. Mellick, If you
will pardon the suggestion, in the delib
erations of a grand jury a district attor
ney is present to interrogate the wit
nesses which he wishes to subpena and
to bring into the grand jury room. He
presumably knows the facts which he de^
sires to lay before the grand jury. If he
does not know all the facts, there Is noth
ing to prevent the granu jury from going
into a general Investigation or Into an'
Investigation of the subject generally.
Neither Is there any limitation upon the
power of the committee here. Granted
r that thTs resolution appointed this com
mittee to cover not only ciiarges directly
made, but charges rumored and which
have, no persons to vouch for them. Now
you have two classes of charges. If the
people who make one class of charges
are here to substantiate those, they might
be permitted to substantiate them and
then, when they get through, the com
mittee could proceed with the other
charges."
The chairmanâ "l apprehend that Mr.
McEnerhey is right in this proposition;
that the investigation of any charges that
he might seek to prove on behalf of The
Call would not bar the investigation of
any other charges that might be, directly
or indirectly, brought before this com
mittee."
Mr. Mellick â "Well, lam not willing
that The Call should come In here and
establish their facts. We want to estab
lish them, and let us go right after them."
Mr. Baconâ "You have got to establish
them by The Call's witnesses, Mr. Mel
lick. That is all that Mr. McEnerney is
talking about and all I am talking about."
Mr. Mellickâ "But he wants his line of
witnesses brought up in his way. He
wants to present the facts."
Mr. Baconâ "l do not understand it, Mr.
Mellick, in that way. Do not understand
me as being here either to make The
Call's fight. 1 do not undestand, Mr. Mel
lick. I do not think you do understand
that whatever the result of this investiga
tion may be it would have any effect
whatever upon the libel suit that you say
is threatened against The Call, because
the evidence that is taken here cannot
be used on that case. It is just simply
suggesting that we proceed with this in
vestigation in an orderly manner in the
hope that we may get through with it
and finish it In an orderly manner. There
is nothing that can be done in this worldâ
I do not care what it isâ except some
system. . You . start in somewhere
and end somewhere. Mr. Grant is her*
ready to testify at any time. He is anx
ious that this thing should proceed and
be over with. He is perfectly ready and
willing to tell all that he knows about this
casâ¬>. But I say that it is not fair to put
Mr. Grant upon the stand in this case al
this stage of the proceedings and ask him
to testify when there is absolutely no
word of any kind before this committee
except the statement in the newspaper
that anything wrong has been done; and,
as Mr. McEnerney has pointed out to you,
there is no necessity for a specific charge.
It Is contained in that article in The Call,
and it is warranted by the statement in
the first part of the resolution under
which you are acting. Now, we are tak
ing more time over it than there is any
necessity for, and I shall say nothing fur
ther about it if I can help it."
The chairmanâ "The Calls statement
relates to a wrong committed by Mr.
Grant, and how could the committee, as
a matter of investigation, get it more
quickly and more readily than from a
man SO willing to testify as Mr. Grant?"
Mr. Baconâ "Yes. Then you are pro
ceeding on a very wrong and a very dan
gerotis theory, Mr. Chairman. You are
taking the newspaper article as an in.
dictmtnt against a man, and I do not
think there is any member of this Legis
lature that wants to start in with that
pr%ceaâ¬nt."
The chairmanâ "Well, I have this to
gay In reference to that: That this com
mittee, in so far as the chairman is con
cernedâand I think it is the sense of
the committee alsoâ l am not assuming
that any man has committed any wrong.
1 am not assuming that there Is any in
dictment of any character whatsoever be
fore this committee."
Mr. Baconâ â¢â¢Well, then, Mr. Chairman,
if you do not assiimt- that any wrong
has' been done you must assume that no
wrong has been done.' '
The chairmanâ "Oh, no."
Mr. Baconâ "Then, why should Mr.
Grant be put upon the stand to show that
there \v:is no wrong- done?"
The chairmanâ "We are simply to de-
U rinim- whether a wrong- has been done."
Mr. Melllckâ "l am not particular about
whether Mr. Grant goes on first or not.
lam not a stickler for that. But lam
a stickler for this: That this committee
shall do the investigating, and not the
attorneys."
Mr. Baconâ "Well, I shall let you alone
hereafter."
Mr. Hanfordâ "Mr. McEnerney, how
long will it take, to get Mr. Leake here?"
Mr. McEnerneyâ "I suppose ten mm
Utf-s."
The Chairmanâ "Mr. Bacon., the pro
cedure outlined by Mr. McEnerney is sat
isfactory to you. Ls it?"
Mr. Baconâ "What is that?"
The Chairmanâ "That those who as
sume to know the facts wherein a wrong
exists shall .first put on their witnesses
and establish the wrong."
Mr. Baconâ "Well, that was my first
statement, Mr. Chairman. Yes, sir. But I
don't want that statement to include this
proposition: That these gentlemen can
be given unlimited* time to do this. We
do. not want this investigation to run
along here and run along an,d run along.
And if there is at any time any disposi
tion shown to do that, why, we shall ex
pect this committee to protect the gen
tleman that is not charged here by bring
ing this thing to a speedy close."
The Chairmanâ "The determination of
that matter must depend upon the devel
opments that shall arise in the investi
gation.
Mr. McEnerney â "Mr. Chairman, may I
ask if the committee has reached any
conclusion in the matter?"
The Chairmanâ "Mr, Leake has been
sent for."
Mr. McEnerneyâ "Has the committee
adopted the suggestion that we made that
wo should carry forward the investiga
tion?"
The Chairman â "Not formally adopted
it."
Mr. McEnerneyâ "Mr. Leake is not the
first witness that we deslre-Mf that is
it."
The Chairmanâ "He is not?"
Mr. McEnerneyâ "No, sir. The first wit
ness we desire is Howard E. Wright."
Mr. Mollickâ "You see? That is the
fliekens of it. I move this, Mr. Chairman:
'Resolved, that this committee be its own
investigators, and that attorneys for oth
ers shall only be permitted to the extent
of protecting or helping their own wit
nesses on the 'stand.' I am not willing
that Mr. McEnerney shall ask Mr. Wright
;i single question, nor Mr. Grant, but I
am willing to take The Call witnesses
and am willing that Mr. McÃnerney shall
Interfere so far as protecting his own
witnesses or suggesting or asking them
questions, and so on. to bring out what
they want to bo brought out."
Mr, McEnerne,y â "Well, our chief wit
noss. Mr. Mellick, is Mr. Howard E.
Wright."
Mr. Mellickâ "Who are you?"
Mr. McEnerneyâ "You are willing, you
Ray, that The Cail should put on its own
witnesses?"
Mr. Mellickâ "No. I am only willing
that you shall interfere for The Call to
the extent of protecting your own wit
nesses, to see whether we are asking
proper questions under this resolution.
But Just as sure as we turn it over to you
you will carry this clear out of the line
of the committee."
The Chairmanâ "ln plain language, Mr.
Mellick is not willing that The Call should
have this opportunity to the truth
of the alleged libelous article."
Mr. Mellickâ "No; not at all. Mr. Mc-
Enerney, I am willing that you shall ask
questions of your own witnesses; that is,
The Call's witnesses."-
Mr. McEnerneyâ "Well, that Is the
point, Mr. Mellick. I claim that Mr.
Wright is one of our witnesses, and you
draw the line at what are our witnesses.
Now you know that it is a very common
practice for a man to call his adversary
us a witness. Now then. If you allow us
to interrogate the employes of The Call,
why do you not allow us to interrogate
Mr. Wright? We say: 'Mr. Wright,
where were you on a certain evening?
Did you on that evening do so and so?'
Now, what Is the use of the committee
spending its time. The committee has not
any idea, probablyâ in legal fiction at
least it has notâ of the circumstances
upon which this charge is predicated."
Mr. Mellickâ "Yes; you can bring it out
by Mr. Leake or Mr. Levings, your own
witnesses. You can bring that fact out."
Mr. McEnerneyâ "lt is not for the pur
pose of determining upon what Informa
tion The Call acted, but it is for the pur
pose of determining whether the charge
Is true, or false. Now then, I assume that
If certain facts were proved by the testi
mony of Mr. Wright here adverse to his
position they would be taken for granted
by tho committee. Then why spend time
roaming over transactions with which
the committee is not acquainted, when I
promise you to get to the heart of the
matter in fifteen questions?"
Mr. Mellickâ "Then' Mr. Wright's wit
nesses will come in here and oppose your
questions."
Mr. McEnerneyâ "lt has been the rule
from time immemorial that the best
means for ascertaining the truth about
a matter is exercised by a wise and ex
peditious cross-examination. Now, than,
if Mr. Wright swears to a certain state
of facts and gives direct answers to direct
questions, that is not going to take very
long."
Mr. Molllckâ "Yes, presuming that to be
the case."
" Mr. McEnerneyâ "Well, it he does not,
the committee will relieve us of our in
quisitorial endeavor."
Mr. W r rightâ "Mr. Chairman, I have
just this moment been served with a sub
pena. I heard there was one issued, and
am not prepared to go on with the ex
amination at this time', as I have been
unable to communicate the fact that I
was to appear to-day to my attorney,
although I have hunted for him. and "i
find him engaged in the Supervisors'
chambers and will be there the rest of
the day. So, if your Honor please. I
should like to be excused from this ex
amination at this time."
The committee then adjourned until
7:30 p. m.
THE EVENING SESSION.
The committee met at 7:30, pursuant to
adjournment, and W. S. Leake was called
to the stand. â 
Testimony of W. S. I*eake.
The chairmanâ "What is your business,
Mr. Leake?"
Aâ "l am manager of the San Francisco
Gall."
Qâ "Are you acquainted with Ulysses S.
Grant Jr.?"
_ Aâ "Yes, sir; I know him by sight, and
I know him to speak to him."
Qâ "Are ,you acquainted with the Hon.
Howard E. Wright?"
A-"Yes, sir."
The chairmanâ "l hand you for exam
ination a copy of The Call of January the
loth. That is the paper of which you are
the manager?"
A â "Yes, sir."
Qâ "Now let me take It, please. Can you
tell me who wrote the matter on the first
page of that paper?"
At-"I am responsible for everything
that is in the paper of that date."
Qâ "And you make this your act, thenâ
the writing of- whatever there is in that
paper of that date?"
Aâ "l am the manager of the Call, and
I am responsible for everything that went
from this end of the line."
Qâ "What do you mean by being respon
sible for it?"
â Aâ "l saw everything that was pub
lished before it left here by telegraph."
Qâ "Whatever was put into this paper,
then, of January 15 was done with your
approval?"
Aâ "With my knowledge and approval."
Mr. Melliokâ "You mean what was sent
from Sacramento?"
A.â "l said from this end of the line."
Q â "You assume the responsibility for
the headlines, too?"
A.â "l did not write the headlines. Those
were written in San Francisco."
The chairmanâ "Now, the opening state
ment of this paper on that date is that
Howard K. Wright of Berkeley, Speaker
of the Assembly, received $1650 from U. S.
Grant Jr., through his political manager,
Milton .S. Green, in return for the promise
that he would vote for Grant for United
States Senator. Mr. L<-ake, will you
kindly state to the committee what knowl
edge you have as to the truth of that
statement "
A. â "That information I received from
Mr. Howard E. Wright himself, also Mil
ton S. Green."
Q.â "Each of them told you that?"
A. â "Mr. Green did 1 not tell me the ex
act amount, but he said it was over a
thousand dollars. Mr. Howard E. Wright
told me it was $1650."
Q. â "Where did you have that conver
sation with' Mr. Wright?"
A. â "New, Mr. Chairman, let me under
stand what the scope of the investigation
is. Do you wish me to lead up to how I
receive i this information, or do you sim
ply war.t me to answer 'yes' or 'no' to
your questions?"
Q.â "l would like to have the full story;
just how you came up to this information,
how you received it.
Mr. McEnorney â "The circumstances
which led up to it?"
The chairmanâ "Yes."
The witnessâ "I would like to state that,
to show you that I came by the informa
tion legitimately and not confidentially,
as might be claimed."
The chairmanâ "Well, that would nat
urally develop, of course. Very well, you
may state It. Mr. Leake."
A.â "Mr. Howard E. Wright was elected
to the Legislature from Alameda County.
I believed that he would be a proper man
to be Speaker of the Assembly. I made
an appointment with him .to meet Mr.
Spreokels and myself in my office in San
FranciÃco. We had a meeting. I asked
Mr. Wright if he. was in any manner obli
gated to any individual, or any corpora
tion, so that he could not give every one
proper representation if he was elected
Speaker of the Assembly, and he told me
that he was as free as the air; mat he
was under no obligations to any one, any
corporation, and had made no promises
and would not make any."
q._"Now pardon me. This was prior to
his election?"
A.â "As Speaker."
Q. â "As Speaker only?"
A.â "But after his election to the Leg
islature."
6 â"Can you name the date about?
Aâ "l cannot. It was shortly after the
election. It was the day before The Call;
came out indorsing him for Speaker.
That date I cannot give you from mem
ory. Mr. Spreckels was present; heard
Mr". Wright's 'statement. I asked Mr.
Spreckels â " _, _, .
Mr Baconâ "Well. now. Mr. Chairman,
I think it would not be proper for him to
give conversations with Mr. Spreckels. '
The chairmanâ "l. was going to ask -if
that was in the presence of Mr. \\ right.
A.â "l said the three of us were in my
P Vh* Chairmanâ "I think that would be
proper." .
Mr. Baconâ "Perfectly proper, so far as
I am concerned." â 
The witnessâ "l told Mr. Spreckels I
would like to be able to have The Call
come out and indorse Mr. Wright for
Speaker of the Assembly. He said after
hearing Mr. Wright's declaration that he
was perfectly willing that I should do so.
The Interview was very short. The next
day the paper came out indorsing Mr.
Wright for Speaker of the Assembly. I
had several conversations with Mr.
Wright took several lunches with him
at the San Francisco Club, at which there,
was nothing particular discussed. The
(â â ill fiskci no promise of him; indorsed
him because they believed him to be the
man for the place. After T came to Sac
ramento, after Mr. Wright was elected
Speaker of the Assembly, he came to The
Call's headquarters on X street, in the
Capitol Hotel, at my request. He came
there for this reason: Mr. Muenter of
San Joaquin had been requested,
the same as every other member
of the Legislature, by The Call to
express their preference either for or
asrainst Mr. D. M. Burns. A telegram
was sent to all of them. Mr. Muenter
came to San Francisco. He did not an
swer the telegram. He told he was op
posed to Mr. Burns and that his people
were opposed to him, but he didn't care
particularly about expressing himself in
print. After some short conversation he
then told meâ authorized me to state that
his people were opposed to Mr. Burns and
under no consideration would he vote for
him. After I reached Sacramento some
three or four gentlemen from Stockton
came overâ the names now I cannot re
callâl know their faces when I see them
âcalled on Mr. Muenter and told him that
he had made a great mistake; that they
had been informed by Mr. Burns' friends
that the administration now would not
give San Joaquin any patronage. Mr.
Muenter brought those gentlemen over to
me and introduced me to them, and we
had quite a long conversation in The Call
headquarters, and they told me that they
had received this information, that Mr.
Muenter would not be even given a
chairmanship of a committee. I felt an
interest in Mr. Muenter; if he had made
a mistake, that I was partially responsi
ble for it. I cent for Mr. Wright and laid
these facts before him. I asked as a per
sonal favorâ not from The Call, but from
myselfâ that Mr. Muenter be given a
chairmanship. Mr. Wright gave me the
assurance that he would receive one.
Then the conversation drifted off into the
Senatorial fight."
The chairmanâ "Now, the conversation
where?"
A.â "ln the headquarters in Sacramento
here. Mr. Wright told me that he was
in a very bad fix. I asked him why."
Q. â "Pardon me. The last I have known
of your conversation you were with
Muenter and these friends in the head
quarters of The Call. Was Mr. Wright
present then?"
A.â "No, sir. I afterward sent for Mr.
Wright to tell him of this conversation
that I had."
Mr. Mellickâ "Do you remember the
date?"
A. â "No, sir. It ,was soon after Mr.
Wright was elected Speaker."
Q.â "The same week?"
A.â "Well, I wouldn't like to state that,
because there was nothing at that time
that would cause a man to set down a
date or impress him particularly about
it. because at that time it was of very
little consequence to me, except that "I
wanted to see Mr. Muenter receive fair
treatment. I say, after we had talked
over Mr. Muenter's affair Mr. Wright
then told me that he was in pretty bad
shape on this Senatorial fight, and I. asked
him why. He told me that Mr. Burns ex
pected him to vote for him, but he says.
I cannot do it.' He then told me of his
marriage relations, his social standing
and a number of other things which I
would not attempt to give verbatim."
The chairmanâ "Who were present
w f hen you were discussing these things?"
A.â "Mr. Wright. There were n number
of the reporters in the room, but I don't
think they heard the conversation. We
were sitting back there in front of a lit
tle screen hack of the stove."
The chairmanâ "The conversation you
are now detailing was between you and
Mr. Wright, by yourselves?"
A.â "Yes, sir. He told me that the last
thing when he left home, that his wife, in
telling him "Good-by," had exacted a
promise from him that he would not dis
grace the family by voting for Mr. Burns,
andâ do you wish me to tell his exact
language?"
Mr. McEnerneyâ "Yes, the exact lan
guage."
The chairmanâ "That is the only thing
to do, yes."
A.â "He said, he then told me somewhat
of a little dramatic scene that passed be
tween him and his wife, in kissing him
good-by. He said. 'Don't you think that
I would be a of a if I would break
my promise to that little woman?' I said
I think you would.' After some little
further conversation, why, we separated.
After Mr. Wright changed his vote and
voted for Burns, Mr. Greenâ l think this
was on Fridayâ "
Mr. Baconâ "Of last week?"
A.â "Yes, sir. It was right after Mr.
Vi right changed his vote from Mr. Bulla
to Mr. Burns. The Call came out with a
lot of interviews with Berkeley people,
and it was on that day, 1 think it was
Friday, I met Mr. Green and we walked
down to the Del Paso saloon. I invited
Mr. Green to participate in a little drink,
and I heard no objections. During that
conversation Mr. Green said to me:
"Leake, you have always thought Wright
was your friend?' I said 'Yes, I have al
ways thought so, and I have no reason
to doubt It.' 'Well.' he said, 'he never was
your friend.' I said, 'Why so?' Well.' he
said, 'he always betrayed everything that
you said to' him. He brought to us every
conversation that took place in the Burns'
headquarters. 1 He then said: 'I can tell
you exactly what Mr. Wright said to you
the day you sent for him in the presence
of- Mr. Spreckels when The Call decided
to come out and indorse him." I asked him
to repeat it, and as near as I can remem
ber the conversation he repeated it ex
actly. He said, 'You had several lunches
with Mr. Wright in the San Francisco
Club?' I said, 'Yes,' and he said, 'He re
ported to us everything that you said,
as he also did to Mr. Burns.' Now,' he
said, 'Mr. Wright is the biggest confi
dertre operating â¢ â â I ever
saw.' 1 said, 'Why so?' 'Well,'
he says, 'how much money did
he get out of Mr. Spreckels?' I said,
'He didn't get a cent. Now,' I said, 'I
will take that hack. I don't know wheth
er Mr. Spreckels helped him individu
ally or not, but I can only speak for The
Call. He asked for nothing and we of
fered him nothing. If Mr. Sprufkeld
helped him at all he helped him individ
ually, and he didn't happen to take me
into his confidence. 'Well, 1 he said, 'he got
Into us pretty well.' I said, "How is that?'
Well, he then went ahead and told me
about Mr. Wright coming over to their
office."
The chairmanâ "Now, this is still in the
El Paso saloon?"
Aâ "ln the Del Paso saloon. He told
me about Mr. Wright coming over to
their office. Now, I don't know where
the office is. He didn't tell me; I didn't
ask him. Mr. Green was temporarily ab
sent. When he got back, either Mr. Grant
or Mr. Brownâ l cannot recall, because
Mr. Green's voice is not quite as loud as
some people apeak, and 1 am not sure
whetiier he said Grant or Brown, because
we were standing up in front of a bar,
and our conversation was rather low; but
my understanding was that it was Mr.
Grant who was in the office when Mr.
Green returned, and he said that Mr.
Wriglit was in an ante-room, or an ad
joiniig room; that he had been there and
had a talk with him, and assured him
that he was for him for United States
Senator, but he needed a little assistance
in his election, and he said: , '.I tojd him
that when ypu are around you would at
tend to him.' Mr. Green sa^ that when
he went into the room where Mr. Wright
was, before he could speak to him, Mr.
Wright said: 'Well, Mr. Green, you have
taken an awful load off my mind. I have
met Mr. Grant axid I have had a little
talk with him. I think very favorably of
him, and I am for him for United States
Senator, and I am awful glad that you
are going to render me this assistance.'
He told me that Mr. Wright told him that
a man by the name of Pringleâ now, at
that time I. did not know who Pringle was,
though I have since learned who he was,
and about him. I didn't know the man
at all; didn't know that he was a candi
date for any office, or had ever held of
fice; he said Mr. Pringle. 'I have got to
give him $200 to get him out of this
Mr' Baconâ "Who said this?"
A.â "Green. Green said that Wright
told him that he wanted $200 to get him
out of this fight."
Mr. Baconâ "l understand."
A.â "Now, Mr. Green told me at the
same time that he gave him other money.
He did not mention the amount; the only
amount he mentioned in this particular
connection was $200 he was to pay Pringle.
He said, 'I gave him the money and he
afterward came back and got $400 more.'
Then he told mo about him writing a
letter to him from the Suttor Club on the
letterhead of the Sutter Club, telling him
that he was in financial distress or
words to that effectâ and wanting him to
pay a bill or a note â something of the
kind."
Mr. MelHckâ "Mr. Green? He wanted
GreÂ«n to pay it?"
The witness â "Green Is talking to me
now _or I am trying to relate his con
versation as it took place. He said, 'I
telephoned to the man and got him over
and took his receipt for the money in
Wright's name,' ami he says. 'I have it
to-day. '" 'Now.' he says, '{hat is the kind
of a duffer he is, and," he says, 'he is al
ways telling me he is for Grant; he is
for Grant all the time.' The conversa
tion lasted quite a little while. Prohably
there was some repetition in the matter.
I went Immediately over to The Call
headquarters, called Mr. Livings and Mr.
Hugh Burke in, and I told him what Mr.
Greon had told me in this connection. A
short time after thatâ well, later in the
nightâ Mr. Burke came over from the
Golden Eagle Hotel, called me off to one
side, and he saidâ"
Mr. Baconâ "Now, we object to what
Mr. Burke said."
The chairmanâ "Yes. Is he an em
ploye of The Call?"
The witnessâ "Yes."
Mr. McEnerneyâ "He carried the mes
sage?" â 
The witnessâ "l am trying to tell you
that he carried the message from Mr.
Wright to me, from the hotel, that he
was going to see me."
The chairmanâ "You are not able to de
tail a conversation between Mr. Burke
and yourself?"
A.â "No. sir. I was going to detail
enough to tell you that Mr. Wright sent
for me to come over there; that he was
going to rule us off the floor."
The chairmanâ "That is all, that is; at
present."
Ms. Bacon--"That is hearsay."
Mr. Mellickâ "l do not think Mr. Bacon
ought to interpose here."
Mr. Bacon-"A11 right, Mr. Mellick. I
won't interpose."
Mr. Mellickâ "Let him tell his story. We
are not sitting here as attorneys."
The witnessâ "l am not here as a prose
cuting witness. I am here simply to tell
what I know. If you want to hear it I
will tell it freely. Mr. Burke came over
and told me that he had just had a con
versation with Mr. Wright and Mr.
Wright said that unless The Call changed
its attitude toward the members of the
Legislature The Call and its employes
would be ruled oft the floor; and, he said,
'He wants to see you. and he will give
you an hour â or remain over there an
hourâ to have a talk with you. 'Well,' I
Bald, 'he won't have to remain but a min
ute to see me.' And I stopped my work
and went over."
The chairman â "Went over to what
place?"
A.â "To the Golden Eagle Hotel. Mr.
Wright, I believe, was playing billiards
or was engaged with some gentleman in
the billiard room. I called him in, and we
again had that usual proposition of tak
ing a drink and no objections, and we had
it. Mr. Wright said that he would like
to see me alone. He then took me
through the billiard-room into a little re
ception room or card room, and sat down
and "he told me that the indignation in the
Assembly was such that he could hardly
control it any longer. He said that tne
Grant men and the Bulla men and the
Burns men and the different factions had
been to him, and the Indignation was such
that he would have to rule the paper off
the floor unless it changed its course. 'Un
less you give me some assurance it will
stop the vilification of the m. tubers of
the Legislature I wiil haw to rule it off
the floor.' He says: 'I do nol waflrt to rt.i
this. 1 ha\e fought against it on account
of my friendship with you.' I said: Now,
Wright, don't let your friendship interfere
with your duty at all, because it cuts no
figure about that. 1 simply represent the
paper, and il you feel it your duty to do
it, rule them off.' He says: 'I will have
to a,, it.' 'Now, 1 I says, 'if you do. you
can exDect tbere will be some fun. I
says: 'There has been a good deal of talk
around here about certain members hav
ing their expenses paid for election an^
Other things,' and I said 'I will get hold
of it and publish the whole thing.' He
said. 'Have you heard about a certain
member receiving money?' 1 said, i
He said, 'Have ycu heard about a certain
other member?' 1 said, '1 have.' 'a cer
tain other itit-m!
The chairmanâ' Did he name those
members?"
A.â "yes, sir."
Q.â "Will you name them?"
A.â "l would prefer not to. because I
haven't any proof thai they goi a centâ
at least some of themâ and I don't think
it is. right to those members to mention
their names In that connection."
Mr. MeUlckâ "They ran prove their in
nocence. 1 think."
The witnessâ "l still insist that I Ought
not to aniwer the question; hut I am tell
ing you the conversation. 1 haven't any
proof in connection wish some of tlit^m,
and I don't think it is treating them right
to have their names a] pear in print in
that connection."
Mr. Robert T. Devlin- "May I ask a
question, Mr. Chairman? Are you in
vestigating charges outside the article in
that issue, that is, that refers to Mr.
Wright?"
The chairmanâ "Yes. we are investigat
ing It all. That is the scope of the reso
lution; it is so construed by me commit
tee." , ,
Mr. Mellickâ "l think that everything
ought to come out. I think he ought to
state it. 1 don't think ere i* any â
The witnessâ "Would you have any Ob
jection to my speaking to my attorney
quietly?"
Mr. McEnerney-"I think it is your
duty to give it, Mr. Lcake."
The witnessâ "l wish it understood now
that I don't think 1 ought to tell it."
Mr. Mellickâ "You understand, Mr.
Leake, that my understanding of this
committee is that am- time we ask a
question, or insist on* a t-ing. you or
course have a perfect right to talk with
your attorney and have him interpose an.
objection."
The witnessâ "lt is understood teat i
am to answer the question?"
The chairmanâ "l think that is the
propei ruling."
The witnessâ "He asked me if I heard
about the money Mr. Cutter had received.
I said I had. 'Have you heard about the
money that Mr. Raw received?' "
Qâ "Mr. Who?"
Aâ "Mr. Raw. I said, 'I have.' "Have
you neard about the money that Mr. Jil
son received?' I said, 'I have.' I said:
'Yes, and I have heard about the money
that you received.' "
Qâ "Proceed."
Aâ "Well, at that time he was consid
erably agitated. 'Well,' he said, 'I will
admit that 1 did receive it, but i am go
ing to pay it back.' 'Well,' I said. 'I
think you would be very foolish to do
that." 'Well; 1 he said, 'I think I ought
to do that. 1 He said: 'This decision
now in the Supreme Court of the United
States has cleared this Blythe estate up
so that I am to receive $7800 from the
estate, and 1 am going to pay Mr. Grant
back. I promised to vote for him; I
fully intended to vote for him, hut
he said, 'Conditions and circumstances
have arisen sn that I cannot, and I think
it is nothing but honorable that I should
return that money.' 'Well,' I said.
â¢Howard, you mad.- a fool of yourself
writing that letter from the Sutter Club.'
1 said, 'Do you know that Mr. Green has
got that letter and has got the receipt
for the money?' 'Yes,' he said, 'I know
that, but 1 was in hard straits and I
needed the money.' He said that part of
it. I said, 'That is all right. 1 He said,
'I intend to pay it back.' 1 said, 'Have
you paid it back?' He said, '1 have not,
but I am going to pay it back. I expect
to get this money now in a few tiays,
and as soon as I do I am going to pay
it back.' I paid. 'It appears to me you
are making- a big mistake.' He took me
to task about these articles from Berke
ley and the 'roast' he Was getting for
voting for Mr. Burns. I tnen related to
him the conversation we had over there in
front of the screen in my headquarters
1 called his attention to the fact about the
promise he had made to his wife and
about his asking me what I thought he
wduld be if he violated his pledge. I said
to him: 'Mr. Wright, I haven't changed
my mind one particle on that since:' tie
asked me if I was going to publish it
that night. I told him I was not. He
asked what the paper was going to say
about him to-morrow. I said tne paper
was going to make some severe charges
against him, but it would not have that.
After some little talk we separated. I
went over and told Mr. Levings and Mr
Burke of the conversation I had with him.
They insisted upon running it that morn
ing. I told them I didn't want to, as Mr.
Wright had threatened to rule us off the
floor, and I proposed to -come out to-mor
row and challenge him to do so. Sat
urday morning we did. On Saturday
morning I then detailed Mr. Burke to go
and interview these different parties.
After he had interviewed themâ talked
with them."
Mr. Melllckâ "What different parties'"
A.â "Mr. Wright and Mr. Green. After
he had seen Mr. Green, Mr. Green came
over to my office at the headquarters and
asked me if I was going to publish this
matter, and I told him that I was He
says. 'It is all true, hut I think you are
making a mistake in doing it.' He said
'You are trying to beat Mr. Burns, are
you not?' I said, 'Yes. the paper is trying
to beat Mr. Burns.' 'Well,' he said 'this
will not hurt Mr. Burns any.' He says
â¢The best thing you can dn, and I will s-_,
advise you, is to hold this as a club over
Mr. Wright's head to keep him from rul
ing you off the floor of the Assembly." We
were sitting on a typewriter d^*k* right
next to the door when this conversation
took place. This was on Saturday night-
Then Mr. Wright sent for me I went
over to the Golden Eagle Hotel and met
him about in the same place I ha.i met
him the night before. He said he wameu
to ccc me privately, and we went right
Into the same room, and he. locked tne
door. He says, 'What dÂ»ea this mean?
Hugh Burke came and told me he knew
ail about the conversation we had last
night.' By the way, I have omitted one
thing that I wish to interject in my talk
with Mr. Wright the first night. I told
him that he must not ask any favors of
me, because I was not in a "position to
grant them. This was the night before."
The chairman â "At what place?"
A.â "ln this little room. I omitted thU
just a little while ago."
Q.â "What occurred in the room at the
Golden Eagle?"
A.â "The reason that I want to get that
in, it leads up to our conversation Satur
day night. That he must not ask any fa-'
vors or me, because I was not in a posi
tion to grant them; that the paper had
this information and that I could not
suppress that, and would not. Now when
we went in this room Saturday night he
locked the door. He cays: 'Look here '
what does this mean? Hugh Burke told
me about our conversation last night '
I said, 'That is true.' He said, 'I was
talking to you like a brother.' I then
called his attention to what I had told
him the night beforeâ that he must not
ask any favors, that he was not talking to
me in a friendly way; that I had the in
formation myself. I said: 'You did not
give me this information. You sent for
me; threatened to put me off the floor
I came and charged you with these thing!)
and you made the admission. So,' I said
â¢you cannot talk about any confidential
relations on that proposition.' I have
omitted two other points in our first con
versation."
The chairmanâ "You may recall them "
The witnessâ "Will you permit me to go
back to that? My attention has just Men
called to it. In this conversation where
he told me he wanted this money to pa,v
Prlngle and others I said: 'Wright, you
went over to Mr. Herrin and demanded
of Mr. Herrin, or requested of Mr. Her
rin, $1200; and in giving the account of
what you wanted this money for you re
lated one item that you also gave to Mr.
Green, and that was the $200 that you
wanted to pay Pringle.' Mr. Wright said.
'I did not do that, Sam. I did get the
money from Mr. Grant, but I will pledge '
you my word and honor that I did not get
it from Mr. Herrin.' Now, also, at the
first night there he told me, ne said:
â¢Now, you want to beat Burns. I doirt
believe Burns can win this tight,' and I
said, 'Well, why don't you pull him out
of it?' He said, 'I think I can do 4t, and
will work on those lines." Now, I will get
back to our last conversation, Saturday
night. He said, 'You remember we talked
about my pulling Burns out of the fight?'
I said, 'Yes.' He said, 'I was just ready
to report to you the progress
I was making when Burke came to seeWRIGHT'S ACCEPTANCE OF MONEY CLEARLY PROVEN.
me.' 'Now,' he says. 'I don t believe Mr
Burns can win this fight, and J think I
can pull him out. and if you will suppress
this information, if you Will not publish
It ' he says 'i feel almost sure I can get
him out.'' i said: 'Wright, I font think
you can get Mr. Burns out of this fight:
and even it you could. 1 c.-uinot suppress
thia Information, because it hsfa been tele
fied to the proprietor oi the paper.
Ie )ir.o\xn what .vin.-s, and,' J says, 'I
am not In position to grant you any fa
vors whatever, and 1 will not do it." Well,
then he became rather violent and made
several threats about killing people and
bring!:. g suits."
Mi Mellickâ "You had better tell the
conversation."
The witnessâ "Well, that is just about
what it la: and he said i! the thing was
published he would kill me, ajid 1 said:
"There is nu i;se delaying; the matter at
all. You have got the floor locked here.
and it hus got to be 'mbl'shed.' He says:
1 will bring a libel suit and siave you
arrested.' I said: "That part of it I
â¢ annnt help. J can Dnly tell you this
i::atter will be published as 1 am telling
you.' Then he brought up this
proposition of ,â¢ ias out, I told
him 1 had to go to the office and consult
w:th the proprietor fit the paper on the
wire, and that I would be back in half
ur. As 1 passed out and left him I
met Mr. Green and Mr. Simpson. Mr.
<rre<n wanted to see me, and 1 told him
that I was very busy and I would return
within a half hour."
Mr. Mellickâ "Whut Simpson?"
Witnessâ "Mr. Simpson Â»t v Â« Chroni
cleâa* I was going out of the room. I
took Mr. Livings and Mr. Burke. We
went over, and after some conversation
the matter was put on the wire and sent
away. I did not go back to the hotel that
night at all. I received this information
about Mr. Wright going to Mr. Herrln
from Mr 'roen. I originally received It
. from M. H. de Young in San Francisco
At the time he told me, he. said, '-peaking
about Wright "
The chairmanâ "Now you are speaking
about what De Young: said?"
Witness â¢Yes. if that is permissible."
, The chairmanâ "Yes."
. The witnessâ "Mr. de Young- told me
that Mr. Wright would vote for Mr.
â  Burns."
Mr. Mellickâ you establish about
the time and place of this?"
â  The witnessâ "Well, I wouldn't like to
set a date, because it was after the paper
came out and indorsed Mr. Wright for
Speaker, ami after Mr. Valentine and Mr.
Belshaw wrote this withdrawal and pub
lished It. It was after thai time. Now,
it might have been a week afterward or
two weeks. It is a matter that 1 would
not like to set a date on. "Mr <ie Young
told me that he was satisfied t!uÂ»t Wright
was going to vote for Mr. Burns, and I
asked him why. 'Because,' he said, 'the
information has gone out that no man
should have a committee chairmanship
..unless lie was a Burns man.' I told him
lhat could not i.e. that 1 was satisfied
that Mr. Valentine and Mr. Belshaw. on
account of the standing that they bad
as indldates for Speaker, would be en
titled to a chairmanship, and my under
standing was that they were opposed to
him. He then told me that Mr. Wright
had gone to Mr. Hi rrln for this money.
The chairmanâ "Where were you during
this conversation?"
A. â"I was in my office."
"The Call office?"
A.â "Mr. de Young had called over there
to talk about Mr. Wright, lie said that
Mr. Wright had been to Mr. Herrin for
this $1200, but Mr. .Herrin only gave him
eight: and he said he gotâ he asked for
$200 to fix Prlngle and he says, 'He got
that $200 from another man.' Now, he did
not tell me who the other man was. Mr.
Oreen told me. after I came here, practi
cally the same thing: That after he got
the money from him to fix Pringle he
then went to Mr. Herrin and asked for
$1200 and Herrin only gave him JSOO."
Q.â "What Green was this that told you
. practically the same thing?"
a.â "Mr. Milton J. Green."

Wright tell you what he did with this
money? "
A. â "Yes. sir. I am prlail yon suggested
that. First he told me he gave Pringle
5200 to get him out of the light, and then
lie said he hnd a hard fight, and he said:
'I Just poured the money in." I don't
know what h-- meant by pouring.' "
Q.â "Did he suggest i" you that he got
money from anybody else?"

Mr. Devlinâ "ln any conversation that

The witnessâ "Not in a position where

The chairmanâ '"lf I did not misunder
stand you. Mr. Leake, you say that, at

A.â "No; but he said he got the money
from another man, but did not tell me
who the other man was. He told me
about the Herrin propositionâ about play
ins; both ends against the middle."
Mr. Devlinâ "l would like to ask the
witness one more question about Mr.
Green. Did Mr. Green, In any conversa
tion with you. say that he had "iven
money to Mr. Wright In consideration of
Mr. Wright voting for Mr. Grant for
Senator?"
A.â "Gave it to him with the under
| standing that he was to vote for Mr.
Grant: told me that explicitly: no ques-
I tion about It, because Mr. Green was
i pretty m:id because he had gone back on
nis words."
Mr. McEnernevâ "Mr. Leake, you testi
fied that Mr. Wright, when he met you
in the Golden Eagle Hotel, just after
you had received his message from
Burke, told you he wanted to see you
alone. In wttose company were you?"
A.â "Mr. Levings anii Mr. Burke, andâ
well, there were a hundred* people In
there, but there were probably five or six
joining in this little beverage."
Q.â "Who went with you to the Golden
Eagle?"
A.â "l took Mr. Levings and Mr. Burke
for the purpose of hearing the conversa
tion, and Mr. Wright would not talk to
me in their presence."
Mr. McEnerneyâ "Now. then, I suggest
to you, gentlemen, if you have a copy of
that Call of last Saturday morningâSun
day morning â that you let Mr. Leake

Mr Baconâ "Mr. Green, in his conver

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1899.
Qâ "Do you know Mr. Leake, who was
just on the stand?"
A â "Yes, sir; 1 know him. I met him
since I cume to Sacramento."
Cjâ "Do you remember of having met
Mr. Leake in the Del Pnso saloon in thia
city a few days ago?"
A.â "l was in there with him one even
ing. Yes, sir."
Q.â "Do you remember the substance of
the conversation that you had there with
him?"
A.â "Well. I would not undertake to give
it. No, sir.'"
"You remember a part of it?'"
A.â "Yes, sir.'"
Q.â "Will you kindly state what was the.
subject of your conversation, and what
was there said between you and >ir.
Leake?"
A.â "Well, I don't know. I didn't charge
my mind with the conversation, but as I
recollect it was thatâ l think we were din
cussing Mr. AVright and his attitude
on the Senatorial question. The fact that
he had voted lor Mr. Bu'.la in the first and
second ballots and afterward changed to
Colonel Burns."
Q-â "Speak a little louder, please."
A.â "We were discussing Mr. Wright
and the action he took in voting."
Q.â "Now. what was saiU by you and by
him on that occasion. You have only
stated the subject matter of your conver
sation."
A.â "Well, Mr. Leake used some very
harsh terms regarding Mr. Wright."
Q.â "Can you state those terms?"
A.â "l wouldn't undertake to say now
what they were: but they were opprobri
ous epithets. And I think I stated to him
in substance that Mr. Wright originally
had been friendly to Mr. Grant, and that
afterwards by his vote had shown a
change of heart, in voting for Mr. Bulla
and subsequently changing from Mr.
Bulla to Mr. Burns. And I think 1 termed
him a political harlot. And Mr. Leake
wanted to know if Mr. Wright had ever
pledged himself to Mr. Grant, and I said
no; but that he had expressed a friendly
feeling for Mr. Grant upon various occa
sions â not only to me, but to other peo
pleâto mutual friends. 1 think I went on
to state that Mr. Wright met Mr. Grant
about a year ago and knew that he was a
candidate for Senator, and that he went
to lunch with him at the Palace Hotel, at
the grill room; and a few days after I
understood that Mr. Wright ' had ex
pressed himself on the Oakland boat as
being charmed with Mr. Grant, and that
if he was elected to the Legislature it
would give him a good deal of pleasure
to vote for Mr. Grant. I told Mr. Leake
that J had been a friend of Mr. Wright
dating back to the Senatorial campaign
of two years ago when he was interested
in Senator Perkins' campaign, and that I
had become very well acquainted with
him; that his record in the Assembly
two years ago was a creditable one. and
that he was a man of pleasing address
and that I understood he expected to go
back to the Assembly and was to be
Speaker. At about that time the primary
flection was held In Alameda County, at
which the delegates were elected to the
County Convention to choose or to nomin
ate the full county ticket; that there was
finite a strife in the city of Oakland be
tween various aspirants on the county
ticket; that there was in some of the
wards one or more candidates, and com
binations were formed between the vari
ous candidates in different wards in dif
ferent sections of the county. And then
I went on to tell Mr. Lenke that I had
been very friendly to Mr. Wright, and
knowing that be had expressed himself
as friendly to Mr. Grant in his aspira
tionsâthat, as I say, I had been very
friendly to him, and I had met some peo
ple who were interested In the primary
election with Mr. Wright and I had said
that I was willing to make a contribution
to the cause."
Q.â "That is. Mr. Wright's cause?"
A.â "Yes, Mr. Wright's causeâ the nomi
nation in which Mr. Wright was interest
edâand that I did so. But that Mr.
Wright had never at any time asked mo
to do so. and that I had never asked Mr.
Wright to vote for Mr. Grant at any time
in my life and that there had been no
promises on Mr. Wright's part that he
would vote for Mr. Grant. I think I also
t<>M him about a loan I had made Mr.
Wright of $750. and probably related the
circumstances, which are as follows;
I cannot remember the exact date,
whether it was before Mr. Wright was
nominated or afterward. I received by
mall one day a letter written from the
Sutter Club in Sacramento, signed by Mr.
Wright, stating that he was on his way to
â¢ '.rants Pass, OreÃon. to close up an im
portant real estate transaction involving
about $Xs.o<>o, and out of which he expect
ed to make a profit of $2000; that he was
owing an obligation to a party in Berke
ley which would not fall due until No
vember, but the party had written him a
hurried note, stating that it would be a
great accommodation if he could meet
that obligation at that time. And my
recollection is that the letter stated that
he had received the word at Sacramento
after he had left home, and he asked me
as a favor if I could not send my check
to this party, or. better still, to telephone
for the gentleman and have him come to
my office and pay him the money and he
would refund It to me from his "share of
the profits of this transaction."
Qâ "You say this letter contained that
Information?"
A.â "Yes; this letter. I have
not seen the letter since the
day it was received, but I am
pretty certain I am giving- the
substance of it. I did send for
the party, telephoned for him.
He gave me the man's name
and the number of the tele
phone. And the gentleman
came over. He was a man I
never had seen, before and
never have seen him since, and
I gave him the $750 and took
his receipt for it on account
of Mr. Wright, and I have that
letter and that receipt."
Q. â "Are they present with you?"
A.â "No, sir; they are in Sun Fran
cisco."
Q.â "You were served with a subpena
to bring all matters of that kind here. I
presume you have not had the opportu
nity to do so?"
A.â "No, sir, none at all."
Q.â "You have not been out of this
city?"
A. â "No, sir. The subpena was served
on me this afternoon about half-past 1."
Q.â "Had you any other conversation
with Mr. Leake relative to any money
transaction between you and Mr.
Wright?"
A.â "Nothing, except what I have
stated."
Q.â -"Did you tell Mr. Leake anything to
the effect that the assistance that you had
given to Mr. Wright from the primaries
on to his election was with the under
standing that he should vote for Mr.
Grant for United States Senator?"
A.â "Emphatically not. I never told him
anything of the sort or anything from
â¢which he could draw that inference."
Mr. Mellickâ "You told Mr. Leake at
that time that it was over $1000 that he
had got of you. did yon not?"
A.â "That included the loan, yes sir."
The chairmanâ "l wanted to ask right
in that connection, Mr. Melliok, how
much money did you contribute toward
the candidacy of Mr. Wright in Berke
ley, as you have stated?"
A.â "Well. I think It wasâ it was all be
fore tho primaries."
y.â "All before the primaries?"
A.â "All before the primaries. I did not
advance any money after the primaries
but to the best of my recollection it wus
$900."
Q.â "To whom did the money directly
go? To Mr. Wripht in person?"
A.â "Well, Mr. Wright talked to
me about that to-day, and he was
under the impression that it went to
his friends in Berkeley. My recollec
tion was that I handed some of that
money to Mr. Wright."
y_"Do you know how much?"
Aâ "No; I do not. 1 cannot remem
ber."
Q.â -"Have you any memorandum or re
cord that will determine that matter?"
Aâ "No, sir."
Q. â Whose money was that?
A. â Well, it was money that
Mr. Grant had given me from
time to time to spend in his
campaign.
Q. â It belonged to that fund,
did it?
A.â l presume it belonged to
that fund. Mr. Grant, of
course, knew nothing of it.
Q. â You say you presume it
did. As a fact, did it belong to
that fund?
A. â Mr. Grant, of course,
sent me money from time to
time, and of course I presume
I will have to account for it in
some way or other â yes, sir.
Q. â And this money that Mr.
Grant sent you from time to
time, did it have for its pur
poses anything other than the
advancement of his candidacy
as a candidate for United
States Senator?
A. â Yes, sir; he sent me
money to buy some stock In a
mine in Tuolumne County.
Q. â But this money that was
expended in Berkeley in the
candidacy of the Honorable
Speaker of the Assembly was
not connected at all with the
purchase of mining stock in
Tuolumne County, was it?
A. â No, no.
Q.â "Now, have you any means, Mr.
Green, whereby you could determine the
persons to whom you paid the money mat
went into the Berkeley campaign?"
A.â "No, 1 cannot. My recollection was
that most of it was given to Mr. Wright
to deliver to the gentlemen who were In
terested in the fight in Berkeley, and still
I am not positive about that. That is my
recollection." <
Q.â "Did Mr. Wright report to you the
method in which he had disbursed this
money?"
A.â "No. sir, I don't think he did."
Q.â "Did you understand at the time
that this money was expended for the
purposes for which it was to be used?"
A.â "Well. I think this: I think that I
had said to some people who were Inter
ested in his campaign, who told me that
Mr. Wright was a candidate â I had said
that I was a friend of Mr. Wright's, and
I never had asked him how he was going
to vote for Senator, and did not desire
any promise or pledge from himâ l think
I snid that I was willing to nsslst him by
making a contribution; but what disposi
tion was made of the money of course I
don't know."
Q.â "What was your object in paying
out Mr. Grant's money for Mr. Wright's
election?"
A.â "To secure the election of a Repub
lican Legislature."
Q.â "As manager for Mr. Grant you
were paying out money to elc-* a Repub
lican Legislature?"
A. â "Yes. sir."
Mr. Mellickâ "But this was before the
nomination was made, Mr. Green?"
Aâ "Yes."
Qâ "The nomination did not have any
thing to do in an overwhelming Repub
lican district with the election of a Re
publican Legislature, did it?"
Aâ "Well, of course it was then diffi
cult to tell whether that district would
be â whether there would be a fusion In
that district or not. Besides that, of
course, it was all in the line of the gen
eral purpose of electing a Republican
Legislature and assisting in the election
of"â
Q.â "No. It was not in the election. Yon
say it was before the primaries? You
pave !he money before the primaries were
heM?"
A.â "Yes. sir."
Q.â "Now. then, you were simply Inter
ested in petting a friend of yours nomi
nated?"
A.â "Well, in that particular rase it was
a gentleman that I was satisfied was a
friend of Mr. Grant's. I never had asked
him; I never had extracted a promise
from him or a pledge of any sort. But
he had expressed himself on numerous
occasions as being friendly to Mr. Grant."
Mr. Sanford â "You would not
have advanced the money had
you not thought he was friendly
to Mr. Grant, would you?
A.â "Yes, sir; I think I would."
Mr.Mellickâ "Did you advance
any for his opponentâ a Re
publican ?"
A.â No, sir."
Mr. Gardnerâ "Do you know Mr. Prin
gle well?"
A.â "l was introduced to himâ well, I
met him twice and both times I was In
troduced to him."
Q.â "Do you know what his preferences
were for United States Senator?"
A. â "No; I never inquired."
The chairmanâ "Had you any con
versation with Mr. Wright nrlor to the
payment of that money as tohow he felt
toward Mr. Qrant'i candidacy?"
A.â "Oh. Mr. Wright had spoken to me
on several occasions. Hi- knew I was In
terested In Mr. Qrant and he had spoken
on several occasionsâ l would meet him
at the hotel and Hometimes on the boat,
and the subject was brought up and he
spoke about Mr. Grantâ what a fine gen
tleman he was â and I used this term:
That he was a charming gentlnman and
It would be a very proud thing for him
to doâ to vote for him if he went to the
Legislature."
Mr. Lardnerâ "Did I understand that
you let him have $900 independent of the
$750?"-
A.â "s7T>o wns the loan; yes."
Q.â "s7so was the* loan; SWi independent
of that; SI6GO in all. Mr. Greon."
A.â "That is my recollection; yes."
Q. â "The $75u was paid to Mr. Yeazell
and SMO was the contribution you spoke
of."
A.â "Yes, Yeazell. I suppose that Is the
name. It was a very peculiar name, i
never had seen it before In print."
Q.â "Was that loan of 57;i0 made after
Mr. Wright's election to the Assembly or
before?"
A.â "Well, that was before."
Mr. Sanfordâ "lt was after the nomina
tion?"
A. â "That is my impression, that it was
after the nomination."
Mr. Mellick â "This whole
$1650 was Mr.Grant's money?"
A.â "Yes, sir; I think it was.
The $750 was. I think Mr.
Grant was in the city at the
time ! received the letter."
Mr. Lardnerâ "Who drewthe
check? How was the money
paid?"
A.â l think that Mr. Grant
drew the check; that is my
recollection."
Q. â "That is the $900
check?"
A.â "No; the $750 check."
Q.â "Did you take any re
ceipt for the $900 contribu
tion?"
A.â "No, sir.
The chairmanâ "Did Mr. Grant know
of your contribution of $900 to Mr.
Wright'fl candidacy?"
Aâ "No, sir; he don't know it to-day."
Q â "Do you manage Mr. Grant's money
absolutely upon your own judgment and
without any consultation with him as to
how it shall be expended in the manage
ment of his Senatorial race?"
Aâ "Yos. Oh. not altogether on my own
judgment. Of course there are othef gen.
tlemen interested with me."
Mr. Mellickâ "Who are the other gentle
men?"
Aâ "Mr. Brown â Mr. James P. Brown."
Qâ "And who else?"
Aâ "Well, I should say that is all."
Mr. La Barerâ "Mr. Shine?"
Aâ "Well, simply as a friend."
Mr. Lardnerâ "Was this $900
an absolute g-ift, or was it ex
pected that it was to be re
paid ?"
A. â "Well, it was a contribu
tion to the fund; don't expect
to be repaid at all."
Mr. Mellickâ' That was to help his nom
ination; not his election?"
A.â "Yes; it was to secure his nomina
tion."
Q.â "And It was a part of the money
that was given you by Mr. Grant to
further Mr. Grant's Senatorial aspira
tions?"
A.â "Well, I cannot say that way.
Mr. Grant sent me money. There
I is no particular money that I was to pay
out for that or no particular money that
I was to pay out for buying mining
stock."
Q.â "Well, was it for any other purpose
that he gave you the money separate
from mining stock or for contributions
during the legislative campaign?"
A.â "No. My recollection Is that those
were the only two purposes."
Qâ Well, then, this money, this
$900, was not for the Tuoluinne min
ing stock, was itP
.A â Well, it was not expended for
that purpose, no, sir.
Q â So it must have been to further
his Senatorial aspirations P
A â Yes, sir.
Q â Now, then, in what way could
it further his Senatorial aspiration' P
A â Well, here was a gentleman
who had been a member of the Legis
lature; he was a candidate for renom
ination. end I had understood from
him that if he was elected he expect
ed to be Speaker. He stated to a
number of people that if elected to
the Assembly he expected to support
Mr. Gr.\nt. And, while this money
was not advanced as Â«i consideration
for his voting for Grant, and there
was no promise exacted that he
would, yet it helped Mr. Grant's Sen
atorial aspirations by securing the
nomination of a gentleman who had
prviously, and some time previously,
announced that if elected, he would
vote for Mr. Grant.
. Q-â Did Mr. Wright make requests at
different times for this $900?"
A. â "No, sir."
. Q.â "For none of it?"
A.â "No, sir. lie never asked me for a
dollar."
, Qâ "Were you present at a time when
Mr. Wright was in there talking to Mr.
Grant and you came in when he wanted
$200 to buy Pringle off?"
A.â "No, sir."
Q.â "Were you not present when he got
$200 for some such purpose?"
A.â "No. sir. My recollection Is. wheth
er he told me or somebody else told me,
that a portion of this money had been
used for the purpose of liquidating Mr.
Pringle's election expenses.
Q.â "Was not there a time when Mr.
Wright and Mr. Grant were together in
the room when you came in. and then,
after you came in, he got some money
off you?"
A.â "l don't remember It at all; I don't
remember that."
Q.â "Or Mr. Brown?"
A.â "l don't remember. I know that I
understood from Mr. Wright or from
some one connected with his canvass over
there that Mr. Pringle had withdrawn
just a day or two prior to the primaries
and that Mr. Wright, at the suggestion
of some of his friends, had offered to re
fund Mr. Pringle the amount of his cam
pa) m expenses."
Q.â "How came you to give the $900?
Was it on the order of Mr. Wright, or did
he come to you for it?"
A.â "My recollection is that it was Mr.
Wright."
The chairmanâ "At one time or several
times?"
A.â "Well. I think It was on two differ
ent occasions."
Q.â "And how was it delivered to him?
In cash or by check? Or otherwise?"
A.â "lt must have been cash; that Is my
recollection."
Q.â "And not by check?"
A. â "I cannot remember that."
Q.â "How do you remember the amount?
Have you a memorandum of it?"
A.â ''No, sir."
<j. â "You expended money In the in
terest of Mr. Grant's candidacy without
keeping any account of it at all?"
A.â "No; I kept no account of It."
Q.â "Have you kept a book account of
the amount of money expended in the in
terest of Mr. Grant's candidacy?"
A.â "No."
Q.â "You have not?"
A.â "No. I haven't kept any book ac
count at all."
Q.â "By what method do you keep an
account of the money you have expended
in Mr. Grant's campaign?"
A. â "Well. I thinkâ I never kept any
book account, I know. I used to receive
money from Mr. Grant by checks, and I
think I kept a memorandum of the
checks."
y.â "Do you have one banking- institu
tion with which you Go business with ref
erence to this moneyâ keeping It on de
posit?"
A.â "No, sir."
Q.â "You do not keep It on deposit?"
A.â "No, sir."
Q.â "Do you know how much money you
have received from Mr. Grant in the in
terest of his candidacy?"
A. â "1 don't remember."
Q.â "Have you any memorandum, check
book, receipt book or other account or
memorandum by which you can deter
mine how much you have received from
him for that purpose?"
A.â "l think I could ,yes, sir."
Q.â "How long would it take you to se
cure such evidence?"
A.â "Well, I should have to go to San
Francisco to get it."
Mr. La Bareeâ "Mr. Green, how did it
happen that Mr. Wright came to your
office and got this $000? Did he come
there voluntarily, or did you send for
him?"
Aâ "No; he came voluntarily."
Qâ "l thought you said he never asked
you"â
A â "Well, he never asked me. but I
had been talking with some gentlemen
who were interested in his canvass about
it. He never asked me for any mone>.
And I had said to them, speaking about
Mr. Wright, that I was willing to make
a contribution to that cause over there;
and I presume some of those gentlemen
must have told him; that, of course, I
knew the friendly relations existing be
tween Mr. Wright and myself."
The chairmanâ Then, when he came,
who first spoke about the money to be
used in his candidacyâ you or he? '
A â "Oh, I could not pretend to say."
Qâ "Do you not remember at all how
the matter arose, that you came to give
the money?"
A.â "Well, my recollection is that I was
talking to some friends of his about his
candidacy, expressing my friendship for
â¢ him and that I felt interested in his can
didacy, and I was told after that he was
on his way to see Colonel Burns to get
some money to help him in his candi
dacy."
Q.â "You heard that?"
A. â "Yes, sir; and that he had said that
he disliked very much to go to Colonel
Hums to get any assistance because Mr.
Grant was his personal preference."
Q.â "Who told you that?"
A.â "Well, I don't think I ought to an
swer that question. It's a gentleman that
is not in politics at all."
Mr. Mellickâ "On what grounds do you
refuse to answer, Mr. Green?"
A.â "He is a gentleman that has never
been Interested in politics at ail and I
should hate to bring his name in."
Q.â "lt seems to me It would be a proper
question If he understood that he was go
ing to Colonel Burns. It seems to me
that we ought to find out where he
his idea. Don't you think so* 1
A. â "Where who got the idea?"
Q.â "Where this friend of yours that
told you Mr. Wright was going to go to
Burns to get a loan. Don't you think that
would be very necessary at this time for
us to find out whether Colonel Burns v.-as
making contributions to the different ones
in the campaign?"
A.â "Well, that is a phase of the case
that of courseâ that is a phase of the dis
cussion that 1 did not care to bring out."
The chairmanâ "lt seems to me that it
is a proper question, but I submit the
matter to the committee."
Mr. Mellickâ "Of course we do not want
to drag anybody in here or their names
in here without there is something that
can be got from them."
The chairmanâ "Here is what may be a
new mineâ a new trailâ a new prospect.
If Mr. Green cannot tell us about any
Improper use of money on the part oi Mr.
Burns, perhaps this friend of his can.
That is the proposition."
A.â "l don t think so at all. That Is my
judgment; that the only Intimation you
could get would probably be to corrob
orate what 1 have now stated."
Q_"TA'ell, did you ever have any con
versation with Mr. Wright with reference
to whether he contemplated seeking Mr.
Burns with the purpose of getting money
to assist in his candidacy?"
A.â "i^ell. 1 cannot recollect on that
point. IPnow I got the information, and
my judgment is 1 got it from this gentle
man whose name 1 have withheld."
Mr. Mellickâ "But, really, Mr. Green, it
seems to me that that person Is liable to
be somebody of importance In this inves
tigation. Don't you think so? Might be?"
A.â "l don't think so, Mr. Mellick. If
any one disputes the statement I have
made, why then I wli give you gentlemen
the name of this party."
The chairmanâ "Then you say, I under
stand you. this is partly Inference, Mr.
Green, that you had heard that Mr.
Wright was about to go to Mr. Burns for
money and thought you would prefer to
assist him in Mr. Grant's interest rath
er than to have him. or what is the fact
with reference to that?"
A.â "The fact is, I had spoken to these
friends of Mr. Wright a week or more
before I had ever heard this story about
his going to Mr. Burnsâ probably two
weeks before."
Q.â "Well, that brings us back again
to the old trail. What led up to the get
ting of this $900 of you by Mr. Wright?"
A. â "It is the conversation that I had
with this gentleman and friend of Mr.
Wright."
Q.â "Then did you volunteer to give the
money to his race?"
A.â "Absolutely; yes, sir."
Q-â "Learning the situation of things,
you go to Mr. Wright and say to him.
I want to contribute to your race over
there and let me give you ao much
money?' "
Aâ "No, sir; I did not."
Qâ "Now I want to get at all the facts."
Aâ "l said that I made that suggestion
to his friends; not to Mr. Wright."
Qâ "To Mr. Wright Indirectly through
his friends. Now, did Mr. Wright tell
you how he was to use that money?"
Aâ "No, sir."
Qâ "Do you know, as a matter of fact,
to whom the money went?"
Aâ "l do not."
Mr. Mellickâ "Now, it does seem to me,
Mr. Chairman, that that person becomes
quite important. Suppose when Mr.
Avright goes on the stand he should say
that his friends simply went to Mr. Green
on their own hook and asked for this
contribution. 'I didn't consider that I
had any obligations whatever." "
Aâ "Well, there was no obligation; not
a bit."
Q â "Well, there was a contribution for
some purpose. You did not give money
without some purpose."
A.â "Well. I contributed the money to
my friendâ a gentleman who announced
on numerous occasions, a month before
that, that he was friendly to Mr. Grant's
aspirations for Senator."
Q â "No. but the point was that I have
not connected the money that you gave
Mr. Wright, because you gave it to some
third party."
The chairmanâ "He said that his
memory was that Mr. Wrig-ht got the
money."
Mr. Sanfordâ "Do you remember the
person that suggested that to you?'
A.â "Suggested that I giveâ"
Qâ "You say that his friends suggested
that there be a contribution?"
A.â "No. It was voluntary on my part.
Entirely so."
Q.â "Who were those friends?"
A.â "Some gentlemen that were in
terested in his canvass in Berkeley
and Oakland."
Q.â "Who were they?"
A.â "Well, one of them was the gentle
man that afterward informed me that Mr.
Wright was going to meet Colonel Burns
to get some money to make his canvass."
The chairmanâ "Did the friend that you*
speak of ever say to you anything about
Mr. Wright's going finally to Mr. Burns
for money?"
A.â "No. sir."
Q.â "You did not know that Mr. Wright
ever did seek money of Mr. Burns?"
A.â "No, sir: 1 know nothing about it
of my own knowledge."
Mr. Lardnerâ "Did you pay the $900 to
Mr. Wright before or after you heard
that he was going to Mr. Burns for as
sistance?"
A.â "WpII, I do not remember whether
the money was actually paid after I
gained that Information or not I know
that I hsd volunteered to assist him,
probably two weeks before I ever heard
of that Incident. "
Q.â "Well, did that Information you got
induce you to pay it over to Mr. wYight?"
A.â "No. sir; not at all."
Mr. Devlinâ "May I ask one question,
Mr. Chairman.?"
The chairmanâ "Yes, sir."
Mr. Devlinâ "Mr. Green, you and Mr.
Wright have been personal friends for
two years or more?
A. â "Yes, sir."
Q.â "Were you Interested In his canvass
two years ago?"
A.â "Yes, sir."
Q.â "Th>' contribution that you have
spoken of of $!XX) you state was given
voluntarily by you either to Mr. Wright
or his friends to secure his nomination?"
A.â "Yes. sir."
Q.â "Was there any understanding or
agreement that Mr. Wright should vote
for Mr. Grant or any oÂ«her candidate for
Senator In consideration of having re
ceivedâeither he or his friendsâ that
$900?"
A.â "Absolutely not."
Q.â "At the time that Mr. Wright ap
plied to you for a loan of $7^o, was there
any consideration or agreement that
therefor Mr. Wright should vote for U. S.
Grant or anybody else for Senator?"
A<â "No, sir. The subject was never
mentioned."
Q.â "Never mentioned?"
A.â "No, sir."
Q.â "Did Mr. Wright at any time ever
promise or agree with you that he would
vote for U. a. Grant for Senator?"
A.â "He never did. And I never asked
him to."
Q.â "You never asked him to?"
A.â "No."
Q.â "ln the conversation that occurred
between you and W. S. Leake In the Del
Paso saloon in Sacramento city did you
tell Mr. Leake that Mr. Wright had
broken his promise in not voting for U
S. Grant?"
A.â "l did not."
A.â "Did you tell Mr. W. S. Leake at
that time or at any other time that you
had given Mr. Wright money in consider
ation of his promise to vote for U. S.
Grant?"
A.â 'l never told Mr. Leake or anybody
else so. Because it is untrue." * :
Mr. Lardnerâ " Did Mr. Wright know
whose money this was when you paid it
to him?"
A.â "No, sir; he did not."
Q.â "Did you lead him to Infer that It
was your own money individually?"
A. â "The subject never was discussed
at all."
Q. â "I am referring now to the $900."
A. â "The subject was never discussed."
Q. â "The, $750 I understood was Mr.
Grant's own individual check?"
A.â "Yes, sir."
Mr. Mellickâ "Has that $750 been paid
back?"
A.â "No, sir."
Q.â "Whv do you count one a contribu
tion and the other a loan? Why do you
make the distinction?"
A.â "Well, because I was perfectly will
ing to contribute to the election of a
Republican Legislature, and I did so. In
that instanceâ that $io0 â Mr. Wright came
up and askod me to advance as a loan for
him. and It Is so considered, and he owes
it to-day."
The chairmanâ "They were different In
characterâ the two transactions?"
A.â "Yes. sir."

What is the average cost of messing per
day, or the price of breakfast, luncheon,
dinner, without allowance for wine or
beer? The average cost in any well-order
ed regiment is 4 shillings per day; it has
been known to be done cheaper, and, of
course, in some cavalry regiments and
"crack" corps, the amount Is considerably
higher. However, a shilling a day may
l>e taken as a very fair average, and wo
cannot say that we think the sum to be
at all out of the way.
The house dinner in the cheapest recog
nized London club comes to halt" a
crown, including table money; and there
are few 7>laces. we fancy, where one can
get a RT&cefully served breakfast and
luncheon, with no lack of variety, for
the combined sum of ISd. In fact, it is
only fair to state that the ordinary
charges for daily messing have been
brought within such limits that those of
ficers who may not have much private
means may be enabled to live in a com
fortable and suitable manner.â Chambers"

When Jacky Is Angry.
According to advices received at Ports
mouth from Gibraltar a strange state of
affairs exists on her Majesty's steamer
Majestic (Captain Prince .Louis of Batten
berg.), flag ship of the channel fleet, lv
! consequence of the ship's company hav
ing strewn on the decks orange peel, pipa
of pomegranates and other objectionable
; debris, the order was given that no fruit
was to be allowed on board, while the
hours for smoking were also curtailed
Dissatisfaction was felt by the crew
and on the night of the 9th ihst. matters
, came to a crisis. During one of the
; watches all the boats' falls were cn t as
well as the guys of the derrick, and an
; eight-inch hawser with a hawser reel the
I butterfly bolts of the torpedo hatch a d
j some gun gear were thrown overboard
The men responsible for the damage have
not been discovered.
The captain mastered the crew, and ad
dressing them said the mischief done was
not the work of one man, but of several,
who were curs and towards. Government
property would not be allowed to be
ruined In that manner, and the com
mander would bave orders to put sen tries
right round the vessel. If one sentry
wns not sufficient to stop the wanton de
struction, they would have two, and even
three.
All leave has been stopped. Diving
operations have been ordered to recover
the missing gear. Much bad feeling has
been created on the ship, as all the men
arc- made to suffer for tho misdoings of a

NEW USE FOR X RaYS.
Chemists Are Using Them in the
Study of Metals and Crystals.
The X rays are fast becoming useful
servants of society. Not content with
making us of them for surgical pur
poses as a means of locating the posi
tion of such foreign substances as a
bullet or a needle in the human body,
scientists have impressed the rays Into
their service for the purpose of ex
amining the internal structure of
metals and alloys.
A thin section of the metal is cut
and a photograph taken by mean? of
the rays; if the metal is homogeneous
it is shown to be so by the photograph
obtained. If, however, an impurity is
present, or the section is that of an
alloy, the photograph is not uniform,
but betrays the presence of minute
crystals formed within the mass of
solid metal.
A specially striking rase is that of an
alloy of metallic sodium with gold. On
throwing such an alloy into alcohol the
sodium is dissolved away, and crystal
line needles, one-eighth of an inch in
length, of pure metallic gold are left.
It would seem that, just as crystals
of common salt separate when a hot
solution of the latter in water is cooled,
gold dissolves in melted sodium and
separates In crystals when the latter
is cooled, and the alloy solidifies.
That the new method of using X rays
is likely to lead to important results in
the study of metals is evident when
we consider the light it is capable of
throwing on the influence of small
quantities of impurities on the com
mercial value of metals.
It is well known that a submarine
cable made from the pure copper of
to-day will carry double as many mes
sages in a given time as a cable manu
factured forty years ago, when special
precautions were not taken to exclude
small amounts of impurity from the
copper. Time is money in telegraphy,
and the additional care taken to re
move the traces of impurity from the
copper is repaid many times over by
the increased capacity of the cable for
transmitting: messages.
The presence in copper as an im
purity of a thousandth part of its
weight of the metal bismuth renders it
absolutely useless for electrical pur
poses. The presence of the same amount
of bismuth in the gold used for coin
age would make the latter crumble to
powder under the pressure of the die
employed for stamping the coin. Ami
the marvelous properties of hard steel
are obtained by simply adding a very
small proportion of carbon to soft, mal
leable Iron.
By means of the X rays thp Internal
chanpre In a metal due to an impurity
can be observed; it is probable that the
results obtained by such investigations
will be of great industrial as well as
scientific importance. â London Daily-

English Army Jealousies.
The .Kitchener crisis is about to col
lapse through the departure of Lord Kitch
ener for Cairo. It has. however, been an.
exceptionally severe crisis while it lasted.
Lord Kitchener has for years been work
ing patiently, perseveringly. intelligently
and without courting publicity. His or
ganization completed, he advanced and
captured Khartoum. But Lord Kitchener
encountered the Khalifa, not Napoleon,
and won the battle of Omdurman. not the
battle of Waterloo. The court and the
country have awarded a welcome to him
â¢which would have sufficed for Welling
ton. It is an open secret that the en
forced retirement of the Duke of Cam
bridge from the post of commander in
chief and the subsequent appointment of
Lord Wolseley to succeed him were not
approved by the court, and it is common
ly known that many officers are not ad
mirers of Lord Wolseley. The demon
stration in favor of Lord Kitchener has,
therefore, been to all intents and pur
poses, a demonstration against Lord
Wolseley, and. it might be added, against
Sir Redvers Buller. The court, the army
and the West End gave the pitch, and,
of course, the populace roared even
louder.â London Truth.

3INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
CORKSCREW TRAIL OF
HOWARD E, WRIGHT
The Mythical $60,000 Ranch With Which
He Did Good Business.
One of the Men He Tried to Bunko Tells of
Wright's Dummy Telegram
Operations.
THE Investigation of the business
Career of Howard E. Wright re
veals the fact that he left a cork
screw trail for the delectation of
the public. He was. one of the
greatest and most reckless proraisers in
his efforts to secure the control of the
money of people with whom he came
in contact that has been in evidence
on this coast for many years.
The experience of people who have
had dealings with him shows that he
not only possessed immaculate clothes
but a gift of gab and a conscience the
elasticity of which was something to
marvel at. He was usually about vto
sell a very valuable piece of property,
or close a great financial deal, which
would place him in possession of a big
sum of money, and by such means he
Mas enabled to carry his schemes along
â¢ and avoid the payment of his debts un
til such time as he could go through in
solvency and afford his creditors an op
portunity to whistle for their money to
. the extent of ?56,000.
â¢ V The fact that Mr. Wright could work
his way into the confidence of the pub
lic to the extent of that vast sum and
convince the court at the time of his
application in Insolvency that he was
possessed uf assets in the shape of
wearing apparel of the value of $100
only, shows the fellow to be possessed
of talents, the proprietorship of which
the average citizen would not care to
acknowledge. In short, his manipula
tions for the promotion of the inter
ests of one Wright were such' as to
make his patrons sorry they ever had
dealings with him.
With reference to these Howard E.
Wright methods of doing business
probably the best posted man in San
Francisco, aside from Harvey, is Rus
sel H. Winston, capitalist and general
Investor, with offices in the Chronicle
building. Mr. Winston has been con
versant with Wright's progress since
the pyrotechnic young man entered
Into the partnership of Le Roy G. Har
vey cc Co., becoming the "company";
and while he may have missed some
of the star plays of the ready-promiser
he knows that individual to his sorrow.
This special sorrow is best illustrated
by rive figures.
"Yes, I am sorry to say that I know
I ward E. Wright very well," said Mr.
Winston yesterday afternoon. "My ex
perience with him Tvas due to the fact
that I had been doing business with
Le Roy G. Harvey a long time before
Mr. Wright became a member of the
firm. 1 had had quite large sums of
money in Harvey's hands and 1 always
got my interest until some time after
Wright was projected into the business.
"Knowing Wright as well as I do
I would not trust him in any position.
He pui up a job to bunko me out of
Blocks and securities of large value,
but I was fortunate enough to be able
to see through his scheme and refused
to accept his proposition. Harvey is
a shrewd man. but this fellow was too
.â¢lever for him. Harvey was doing a
good, safe, growing business and then
his ill luck came in the person of
Wright, who told him of the large lines
of business he could bring into the
firm and thereby make it a great in
stitution. Furthermore that he had
valuable properties in the country
â which at a favorable time he would sell
and pay for his share in the firm of
Le Roy G. Harvey & Co.
â¢ "Harvey was charmed with Wright's
manner and taking him to be what he
represented himself to be, accepted
Wright as a partner. The new partner
was a swell dresser, and in the ver
nacular of the street, a 'con talker'
hard to beat. Whatever other things
he did he 'did' Harvey successfully and
his system was most certainly clever.
The promise talk went on without ces
sation and when the situation looked
all right Mr. Wright began reducing
the funds of the firm by drawing upon
them most industriously. He always
had an urgent reason why he should
have the desired amount without de
lay and he got it.
"Things went on in this way for some
time and finally when the drafts of
Wright upon the resources of the insti
tution had developed the fact that the
â¢wrong man had been admitted to the
firm, I asked Harvey one day why he,
whom everybody regarded as an able
and careful business man, had per-,
mitted such a gosling to get the best of
him. Harvey's reply was that he had
met with many hard propositions, but
that Wright was the smoothest article
it had ever been his bad luck to come
in close contact with. He was cer
tainly correct in his deductions.
"About that time Harvey was putting
pressure on Wright to induce him
not only to make good his overdrafts,
but to produce the money due from him
to be applied to the capital of the firm.
Wright played the same game on Har
vey that he did on me. It was a good
one and calculated to deceive almost
anybody. It was in the shape of a
dummy dispatch, and my recollection
is that it was dated Nevada City. It
Bet forth an offer- of $60,000 .to Wright
for a piece of valuable ranch. property
.In the section named. Wright in the
promotion of his scheme declared that
it would be a shame to sell the property
for such a price and that he proposed
to hold on and get a better figure.
"This is no fairy tale, for I saw that
kind of a dispatch on Harvey's desk
one day after he had been endeavoring
' to induce Wright to make good his ob
. ligations. At that time the dispatch
was supposed to be authentic, and a
man who was in a position to convert
real estate into $60,000 at any time was
supposed to be safe to wait upon. The
time finally came when we suspected
' Wright of deception, and we instituted
a search for that sixty-thousand-dollar
ranch. You may be surprised to learn
. that we were never able to determine
upon what particular portion of God's
green footstool . that valuable property
' was located. The reason was that that
ranch existed only in the very fertile
brain of Howard E. Wright^. It was a
good scheme and it worked nicely.;
. "When Wright's duplicity, was finally
. discovered, and it became evident. that
lie must get out of the firm with' the
large claims against him still unsatis
; fied, he evolved another idea and put It
; Into execution. This was nothing more.
' or lees than to go around among the
I best patrons of the concern, the men
j and women who had their money on
; deposit with it, and poison their minds
! against Harvey by asserting that he
j was a disreputable man, the keeper of
mistresses; that he was becoming a
! drunkard and on occasions had been
i taken home on a shutter. All of which
! was false and for the purpose of creat
ing an impression that the business of
the concern was being neglected and
that the interests of patrons were not
being protected. Wright did this kind
(if work industriously, and the downfall
of the house is pretty good evidence
that he did his work well. It was due
to the poisonous tongue of Wright that
Harvey was arrested by one of the
patrons of the institution on the charge
of embezzlement.
"Wright finally went out of the busi
ness, giving notes to his partner for
! about $20,000 due. He refused to pay
I those notes on maturity and when the
holder of them brought suit to collect
he deliberately went into Insolvency
; and left Harvey and his numerous
other creditors with absolutely no re
i sources.
"People who do not know him regard
the fellow as a nice, harmless, happy
! go-lucky chap; but it strikes me that
i he is about as clever a schemer as can
!be found in the community. He was
1 clever enough to get into Le Roy G.
1 Harvey & Co. for the sum of about
$20,000. the debt of which he acknowl
edged by giving notes in that amount
and to finally shirk all responsibility by
goins through insolvency before a
judgment could be secured against
i him.' '
MANY UNIMPORTANT
BILLS IN THE SENATE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 17.â The Senate this morn
ing considered the rules. The proposi
tion that the San Francisco delegation
should be recognized as a special commit
tee was rejected.
Senator Dickinson of Marin County
stated that if the San Francisco delega
tion was to be constituted a special com
mittee to- handle proposed legislation af
fecting that city and county he would
a-sk that Marln County delegation be
made a special committee, with similar
jurisdiction.
The special order was Senator Simp
son's bill transferring $40,000 from the
general fund to the State school book
fund.
Senator Smith of Kern County entered
a vigorous protest against any action on
the bill until it was clearly understood.
He thought there should be an investiga
tion as to what was to be done with the
money after it was transferred for the
benefit of the Senators.
Senator Simpson in making a reference
of the bill to the Finance Committee
stated that he thought that Senator
Smith was displaying considerable spleen
in discussing the measure. He said the
bill was not an appropriation, but was
Bimply a return of money to the school
book fund that had been asked for by the
State Printer. It was an instance where
the State Printer was right and In Sena
tor Simpson's judgment the Senate should
sustain him.
Senator Smith, made vigorous denial of
the charge that his action with regard
to Simpson's bill was influenced by per
sonal considerations. The bill Involved a
large sum of money, and as a business
proposition Senator Smith thought that
the Senate should be fully posted and in
formed as to the exact facts.
The matter was finally disposed of for
the time by Its reference to the Finance
Committee.
Senator Bulla filed a vigorous objection
because the Senators haa not been pro
vided with files and copies of bills intro
duced. Senator Cutter recognized the ob
jection by introducing a resolution provid
ing for the purchase of five dozen Globe
files, and the proposition was approved.
A number of bills wers introduced, but
none of any great importance. Senator
Stratton, by request, presented a bill to
provide for the incorporation of mutual
flre Insurance companies. It is similar to
the etatute In oWher States provraing for
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1899.
incorporation of companies of that char
acter.
Senator Nutt presented a measure
which amends the Wright act to the ex
tent that it gives Irrigation districts the
right to suspend operations if the voters
of the district so decide.
Senator Maggard wants to cut off a
clerk in the State Controller's office, and
he introduced a bill repealing the statute
which provides* for the clerk.
Senator Langford thinks that the State
Lunacy Commission is an expensive lux
ury, and he presented a bill which will
have the effect of abolishing it. Should
the measure become a law it will leave
the government of the State Insane asy
lums, in the hands of the Hoards of Trus
tees by the Governor to direct
the affairs of the particular asylum to
which they are appointed. Each has a
board of five trustees now. but their du
ties and authority are subject to that
of the State Lunacy Commission at pres-
ent.
Senator Jones, from the prohibition coun
ties of Orange and Riverside, presented a
measure providing for the submission to
a vote of the people of the proposition to
either license or prohibit the sale of in
toxicating liquors In cities of the fifth and
sixui class. By its provisions the bill of
Senator Jones declares that when a pe
tition signed by not !Â°ss than one-third
of the electors of a city of the fifth or
sixth class Is presented to the Board of
Trustees of such cities thirty days prior
to a general mtfnicipal election, praying
for the submission of the license or anti
license proposition, it shall be submitted
to a vote of the people at the forthcoming
city election. Of course, by the term anti
license is meant prohibition.
ROUTINE BUSINESS IN

MENTO, Jan. 17.â The charges The Call
has made against Speaker Wright, and
the committee that has been appointed to
investigate them, make the sole topic of
conversation on the floor of the Assem
bly.
Routine business is demoralized. Assem
blyman Dibble said to-day that regular
business is three weeks behindhand, and
that matters will be in a worse state be
fore this Investigation is over.
The Senatorial deadlock Is another agent
of delay. Committee work is interfered
with by quiet little caucuses, and the files
are not as well stuffed with bills as they
should be because of (ncictental politics.
The San Francisco charter was the spe
cial order following the reading of the
journal this morning, but typographical
'errors were discovered in the printed
( opy and it was sent bark to the State
l'linting Office for correction. It will be
again taken up to-morrow morning.
The Judiciary Committee rendered its
first report, and recommended the passage
of A B 21. which transfers $40,000 from the
general fund to the State school book
fund. The passage was also recommended
of bill 117, amending the law regulating
the borrowing of money and the issuance
of bonds by railroad corporations. As
the law stands now $500 Is the minimum
amount In which a bond may be issued.
Under the proposed amendment the limit
Is done away with, and bonds may be is
sued In any denomination.
I .ill 22. by Rickard of San Francisco,
was reported back with a recommendation
that it be withdrawn. It was so ordered.
The bill provides for a tax on inherl-
tances.

ommended the passage of Valentine's bill
appropriating $150,000 for California's ex
hibit at the Paris Exposition in 1900.
Senate bill 190, which Is intended to
amend the Belshaw attache law out of
existence, was taken up and referred to
the Comlmttee on Attaches. It will be the
special order to-morrow morning, follow
ing the San Francisco charter.
Only eleven bills were Introduced dur

to the usual hour to-morrow morning.
THE STATE SUPPORTS
TOO MANY INDIGENTS
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 17.â 1t has been
discovered that several millions of dol
lars have been drawn from the State
treasury through the cleverness of claim
agents since 1883. The Legislature of that
year passed a law the object of which
was to provide for the support of aged
s^nd indigent persons, allowing each $100
per year.
The measure, meeting with abuses, It
was repealed in February, 1895, but that
fact has not prevented thrifty claim
agents from operating under cover of the
old law and official- reports on file in the
office of the State Controller show that
since June 30, 1884, the enormous sum of
$2,991,827 29 has brpn drawn from the State
treasury, high-water mark being reached
in the veafr ending June 30, 1895, when
$543,921 05 was paid out. The claims have
come ostensibly from the chairmen of the
Boards of Supervisors of the several
counties, but as a matter of fact they
have of late years been gathered and filed
almost exclusively by W. H. Pyburn,
County Clerk of Monterey County, and
J. E. Douglas, an accountant of San Ber
nardino.
As the law was repealed in 1895. all the
claims now being presented are for sup
port given prior to that time, majiy run
ning back as far as the year when the
law was passedâ lÃÃ3.
The extent of the sums Involved may be
understood when it is stated that the
Board of Examiners took a $12,000 slice
off a rather immodest claim from Santa
Cruz County, claiming that it was to that
extent illegal inasmuch as there were no
vouchers. The county never made any
complaint, however, and produced no
vouchers. Fresno -had 15000 lopped off for
similar reasons, and Alameda County
sunn; years ago, It is said, had to put
up with a $30,000 cut down on its little
bill.
The various counties have been scoured
for cases of aged people, and claims made
that they were supported by some indi
vidual or other, from ISS3 to 1895, at the
expense of the county.
The claim agents who have been hunt
ing up these touching instances of pov
erty have been drawing down from 25 to
50 per cent of the sums which they were
enabled to secure for the counties upon
filing the claims with the Board of Ex
aminers.
It is impossible to decide whether or
not many of the claims which are con
stantly being filed are meritorious, since
in many cases the aged people named
therein are where the weary are presum
ably at rest.

up from San Francisco yesterday, and
bi ought with him all the ballots cast in
the Thirty-ninth Assembly District at the

It is upon these ballots that Leon Jones
is basing his hope of winning the contest
he has begun for tho seat of Assembly
man Justus Wardell. As far as the re
count has progressed to-day not much has
transpired that promises him success.
Ten precincts were counted to-day by
the Assembly Committee on Contested
Elections, and Jones has gained but three
votes, all of which were awarded him by
the committee because they were Improp
erly thrown out by the election officers.
Jones' gain of three, however, does not
reduce Warden's majority of ten, and he
nwst gain eleven more votes in the eleven
precincts that remain to be counted in
order to win. It is expected by the com

GROVE JOHNSON WANTS
TO HELP JAG HOUSES
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 17.â Grove L. Johnson of
Sacramento Introduced In the Assembly
this morning a bill that has for its ob
ject the protection by the State of the
infamous so-called Homes for the Inebri
ates,
Mr. Johnson proposes to place at the
disposal of the managers of these Insti
tution* the police officers of municipali
ties and all county peace officers, whose
duties it shall be to rake in every bibu
lous citizen with a bright red jag and
drag him to the "home," which Is to have
a lien upon his estate for the cost of his
maintenance and all cost 3of arrest.
In order to create business for the-own
ers of homes to draw upon Mr. Johnson
creates a class to be known as "Inebri
ates." Any mart who shall be an habit
ual drunkard or who drinks to the extent
that his business interests suffer or his
life be shortened is made an inebriate and
may he arrested on sight. State licenses
shall be issued to any of these institutions
upon application and agreement to abide
by the rules laid down by the State for
the conduct of asylums for the Insane,
but these rules may be amended from
time to time to suit the needs of these
institutions.
There is a good-sized nigger in Mr.

that it will pass as formulated.
THE FIGHT ON SAN
FRANCISCO'S CHARTER
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 17.â The fight that is to De
made against San Francisco's charter did
not open to-day in the Assembly, as was
expected. Yesterday the consideration of
the charter was made the special order
for to-day after reading of the Journal.
No opposition to it was expected, and tne
news that Grove L. Johnson of Sacra
mento was to voice the objections of the
railroad to it on the floor of the Assem
bly came as a surprise. The fact that
Johnson was to interfere in the matter,
in which he has no direct interest, was
already known to Hon. Charles L. Pat
ton and Hon. Henry L. Clement, and they
hurried to this city this evening, prenared
to meet Johnson to-morrow morning.
Johnson will base his fight on purely
technical grounds. He and Assemblyman
Dibble are about the only members on
the floor who are foolhardy enough to
risk political effacement In openly op
posing it.
Its consideration will require the great
est portion of to-morrow's session. It must
be read at length by the clerk, and as
there are 73,000 words of printed matter
in it, progress will necessarily be slow

produced by her son"s death, was mur
dered on September 10 by an assassin of
Anarchist opinions. The Emperor, there
fore, broods in melancholy retirement,
listening always, one can imagine, to tho
sounds of another great storm now roll
ing up against the fortunes of his race.
The ultimate danger of the house of
Hapsburg, and perhaps the ultimate
secret of its strength, the hatred of race
which its subjects bear to one another,
has broken out afresh, and we have yet
to see whether the Emperor can again
quiet the rapidly rising waves. If his life
Is to be thoroughly consistent, he should
on some great day be once more beaten
to the ground, possibly by a revolt of his
German subjects, should then achieve
some Impossible success, possibly the
throne of Constantinople, and thencefor
ward should glide on to the grave, a
mighty monarch of whom history will say
that his failures and his successes remain
equally inexplicable. To him, alone among
all the sovereigns we can recall, the
strange destiny has been given that he
should never succeed, yet never suffer
from failure, that ashes should always be
presented to his lips, and that they should
nourish him better than bread.â The

WRIGHT WAS UNDONE
BY DOUBLE DEALING
The Story of His Baseness Told in All
Its Details.
No Chance of His Emerging From the Ordeal
With a Shred of Character Left After
the Committee Closes Its Work.
BY HENRY JAMES.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 17. â People who can learn
of the Senatorial contest by reading the
papers are fortunate, for the apart
ment in which the contest is supposed
to progress is not a pleasant spot when
crowded. The ventilation is bad, the
chairs inadequate, and the pleasure of
listening to a lot of members calling
off the same names they have been call
ing for days, and which they avow they
will call to the end of time, is not of a
character to thrill the soul.
There were no changes to record.
There is a break predicted for to-mor
row, but there has been a break pre
dicted for every to-morrow and faith
grows weak.
At this writing, to guess is futile, for
there is to be an investigation this
evening, and what may be the effect of
it is impossible to surmise. The in
vestigation was almost started this
afternoon, but did nothing more than
lay a foundation. The members want
ed it to be conducted on certain lines.
Attorneys were present with sugges
tions, and, while these were being con
sidered, the room became crowded and
adjournment was taken to the Senate
chamber, where the committee received
Mr. Wright, heard from him that he
was not ready to take the stand, and
then everything went over until even
ing.
The committee met first in room 73.
It is a little room, a table occupying
most of it and a majority of the spec
tators had to stand. The only candi
date for the Senatorship present was
U. S. Grant. He was accompanied by-
Milton Green and represented by At
toriey Bacon. Cosper was chairman
and Meade came in just long enough to
say that he would not serve, could not
be made to serve, and he didn't serve.
There were a good many words ex
changed before a plan of â  procedure
had been agreed upon.
I could note many signs of enthusi
asm on the part of the committee. That
it is made up of Intelligent men there
j is no reason to question, but It faced
i difficult and delicate problems. It had
; been charged with the mission of as
certaining if the accusation made in
\ The Call against Speaker Wright was
' based on fact and had been empowered
| to ascertain the whole truth concern
|ing legislative corruption. There was
I every probability that the reputation
j of associates would be struck, down;
that a scandal already admitted to ex
ist would be dragged into fiercer light,
and however essential this task might
be it could not be regarded as a pleas
ing duty. .1 felt like congratulating
Meade that his other work was pressing
enough to justify him in declining to
serve.
As this Is written the evening session
of the committee takes place In the
Capitol. I was there for a time. There
is no occasion that I can see for criti
cising the couree of the committee thus
far. It has indicated that it intends
to pursue its own course and not per
mit lawyers to direct. The members
individually have expressed the inten
tion of being thorough, and they could
hardly fail to be so, since the witnesses
are known and are ready. While the
Wright matter is the only one under
consideration now there is no limita
tion placed upon the authority of the
committee, and it may have to deal
with more than this one episode.
Speaker Wright was to have been the
first witness, but was excused in the
evening as he had been in the after
noon on the plea that his attorneys
were not ready. The observer, devoid
of prejudice, could not but feel sorry
for this man. There awaits him an
ordeal from which there appears no
chance of his emerging with a shred of
character left. The allegations are so
specific and so circumstantially sus
tained, that they seem to constitute an
unassailable indictment. Wright when
addressing the committee spoke in a
voice indicative of suppressed excite
ment, and no wonder. The strain un
der which he has been laboring for days
must have been terrific.
W. S. Leake was the first witness. He
calmly told the story of Wright's hav
ing received money from Grant, and
cited as his authorities Wright him
self and Milton Green. The story was
as it had appeared in The Call, except
that Mr. Leake, in his narration, went
farther back, and step by step por
trayed the events leading up to the de
nouement which had startled the peo
ple of California. He was permitted to
go on without much questioning for
awhile, but at last was forced to answer
as to the identity of others than Wright
whom he believed to be implicated or
who had been mentioned by Wright as
being implicated. Against some of
these, as he explained to the committee.
; he had no evidence, and had no reason
! to doubt their integrity and regretted
| that their names should have been de
manded. On this point, however, the
committee was inexorable. Mr. Leake
j asked time to consult his attorney,
who advised that there was no escape,
\ as refusal would be contempt and pun
ishable as in any court.
The crowd In attendance paid the
j keenest attention. Indeed, this was ob
j ligatory, as both the witness and mem
| bers of the committee spoke in low
I tones. But the Interest throughout was
: intense, and there were murmurs which
I expressed surprise when the testimony
; set forth the methods of the Speaker ol
I the Assembly.
When the scathing language he had
used in speaking of Burns was quoted,
the people fairly gasped, for his act ol
going into the Burns camp had been
the actual means of bringing about a
I revelation as to his deal with the Grant
forces. He had reviled Burns, had made
I affiliations with a rival, had premised
j not to vote for Burns and had told
! freely of the promise, yet had gone
: over to Burns, tremulous, shamefaced,
| but still he had gone. The indignation
I excited by this double-dealing had been
his undoing.
The second witness was Milton Green.
At this moment he is still on the stand.
As to the fact that Wright had received
$1650, he corroborated the previous wit
ness fully, and this, as I understand it,
is the meat of the contention. Mr.
Green followed the custom of speaking
in a low voice, and those who wished
to hear pressed close into the corner
where the committee sat. He said that
$900 of this sum had been for election
expenses, and the rest a flat loan. W T hat
followed will be found in the news col
umns. The facts are simple, and the
right to draw conclusions rests with
any person.
What is to be the immediate effect of
the investigation is a surmise.- I am
not informed as to whether a man
guilty of the practices charged against
Wright will have the privilege of con
tinuing in office, presiding over a body
of men who have much to do with di
recting the destiny of the State, and
most of whom are honest and honorable
men. But that there will be a change
visible in the vote to-morrow seems
likely. It is riot a reasonable propo
sition that all this stir will merely die
'fcway as a ripple on the surface, for the
Assenrbly Mas been moved to its
depths.
Burns men are rejoicing, but without
grounds for it. They have acquired a
new zest for the pipe dream in which
they have been indulging. The show
ing that Grant's manager paid money,
and as he declares, without the knowl
edge of Grant, will naturally affect the
prospects of the San Diegan, but it will
not enhance those of the Mexican. As
between the two men, with every
secret of the campaign laid bare, I
would not hesitate to choose Grant.
Such congratulations as may be In
dulged in may be divided among the
men whose names have not been used
as a shield for Burns' vote, who have
not, perhaps, made a great showing
of strength, and who have been waiting
all these days for something to happen.
I think it is about to happen.
Motives and Marriages.
The motives for which women marry
are as numerous as the sands of the sea,
or â as the women. Our easy assumption
is that each one of every engaged couple
is "in love" with the "other one." That
is, the parties are drawn together by
some mysterious psychic attraction, more
or less strong. In truth, this inner per
sonal attraction is not always present,
either in both parties to an engagement
or even with one of the pair. Accident,
propinquity, trifling circumstances, social
or family pressure, some slight airy noth
ing decides the question between mar
riage or no marriage for the woman so
slight, that it is as If women were always
waiting on the brink of this new experi
ence, and a very light touch caused them
to fall into, or wander into, or drift Into
it, according to their several tempera
ments.â Harper'sÃazar.

Pretty Mrs. Young Was
Fully Dressed.
EXPECTED A CONFLAGRATION
SENSATION IN THE TIBURON
ARSON CASE.
Evidence That thÂ« Wife of the Ac
cused Man Was Prepared to
Flee From the
Flames.
Pr>f"-!n! Dispatch to Tha Call.
SAX RAFAEL, Jan. 17.â 1f the most
important link in the chain of evidence
connecting Henry Young with at
tempted arson at Tiburon had been
known m the infuriated townsmen the
night he was arrested by Deputy Con
stable Fletcher and placed under the
guard of the two armed men he prob
ably would not have lived to be the
central figure in the sensational trial
to begin next Monday. District At
torney Mclsaac and Constable Hughes,
â who have been hard at work collect
ing evidence against the accused man,
were rewarded to-day by the discov
ery of facts which those authorities be
lieve will not only send Young himself
to the penitentiary, but which place his
pretty little wife in the unenviable light
of an accomplice in the crime.
Half an hour after the fire had been
started in the "Daily Supply." or Young
& Mitchell's store, and while an angry
mob was clamoring for the life of the
Euspected man, Mrs. Young slipped
quietly away with suicidal intent and
jumped into the waters of the bay. She
was rescued, t.-iken to the Sonoma
House and placed in the care of Mrs.
Cookson, Mrs. Hansen, Mrs. Lind and j
Miss Kate O'Connell. These women
now come forward with statements
that warrant the authorities in believ
ing the conviction of Young certain.
At the tim^ she attempted suicide by ;
drowning Mrs. Young wore a night- â¢
dress, the same garment in which she
was attired on leaving the burning
building. When the women who were
delegated to take care of Mrs. Young
started to remove her wet clothing they
were astonished to discover that she
was completely dressed and that the
nightgown had been donned over her
regular garments. This is taken as
proof that she was awaiting the alarm
of fire and had not been in bed at all,
late as was the hour.
Another important witness who vol
unteers testimony is the cook of Mrs.
Lind. who lived next door to the
Youngs. She says that late in the
evening, after the clerk, Edward But
l-r, had departed, both Young and his
wife appeared in the back yard and cut
a large quantity of kindling wood,
something neither had been seen to do
at any time previously. All six rooms
in which the fires were started wera
filled with kindling wood saturated with
kerosene oil.
District Attorney Mclsaac admits
that he is in possession of several othei
?trong circumstantial links, hut for ob
vious reasons refuses to divulge their
nature. Young is a wealthy man and
has engaged Attorney J. TV. Coehrane
for his defense, with the assertion that
BURNS TO GRANT: " THIS IS NOT YOURS, BUT MINEHKY LATEST MINE."
he will spend every cent he possesses
before he will go to jail.
The citizens of Tiburon held a mass
meeting, presided over by John Bonner,
a railroad yard foremnn, on Saturday
evening to consider the proposition to
establish a fire department and purÂ»
chase the necessary apparatus. A large
quantity of pipe was purchased in San
Francisco yesterday. Should any fire
ever gain the least headway at
the present time the defenseless town
would be doomed.
"MEXICAN MORPHY"
HELD FOR TRIAL
Alleged Forger Denies That He De
frauded the Bank in Which He
Was Employed.
NEW ORLEANS, Jan. 17.â Santiago
Morphy, charged with being a fugitive
from justice from the City of Mexico,
where he is wanted, it is said, for hav
ing procured from the National Bank
$70,000 by means of forged checks, was
given a preliminary hearing this even
ing before Judge A. G. Brlce. He was
represented by Judge Henriques. Bail
was fixed at $20,000, in default of which
Morphy was remanded to jail.
Morphy made no attempt to conceal
his identity, talking to reporters freely.
He seemed astonished that he was
wanted for participation in the rob
bery of the National Bank, in which
he held a clerical position up to the
time of leaving the country, ten months
ago. He said he had made no secret
of his whereabouts at any time and
had been in constant communication
with friends and relatives, and never
until his arrest last night had he had
I even a suspicion he was believed to
: have had anything to do with the crime
charged. He says he assumed the
name of George Murphy on the race
tracks as it would have ruined him in
Mexico were it known he was following
the turf. He says the story that he
lost any part of the stolen money in the
Baldwin Hotel fire in San Francisco is
untrue.
FATALLY INFECTED
BY DISEASE BACILLI
Dr. Guiseppe Bosso Falls a Sacrifice
to His Dangerous Scientific
Research.
NEW YORK. Jan. 17.â The Journal has
this from Rome: Pr. Giuseppe Bosso of
Turin University died to-day from an in
fection contracted while cultivating the
j bacilli of various diseases in his labora
tory.
S'"-Â«eni â¢rccautions have been taken
by the municipal and university authori
ties to prevent further infeytion from the
bacilli that may have escaped. There is
; great fear of another outbreak like that
recently experienced in Vienna, when sev
eral persons died from bubonic plague
caused by careless cultivation of the
deadly bacilli.
So far. no other cases have been report
ed, but the physicians and nurses who at
tended Dr. Bosso have been isolated.
SAN JOSE'S POULTRY SHOW.
SAX JOSE. Jan. 17.â A1l is in readiness
for the opening of the annual poultry
show of the Santa Clara Valley Poultry
and Kennel Club at Turn Verein Hall to

BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 17.â Murderer
Gleason, who walked out of jail on
Sunday, Vs again behind the bars. He
was captured at 6 o'clock this evening
six miles from here, at Bealville, a sta
tion on the Southern Pacific this side
of Tehachapi. Deputy Sheriff T.
W. Glover was the officer who made
the capture. In less than three hours
he had the prisoner in jail.
Glover "got wind" that his man was
in the neighborhood of Bealville. He
got a fresh horse and reached the point
in less than three hours. Much of the
way he had no road and had to go
through many fences. A few minutes
aftnr arriving at Bealville he had
Gleason captured and handcuffed, and
shortly afterward the northbound pas
senger was boarded and they were
soon at the jail.
Gleason was unarmed when captured.
Several persons met Gleason during
the day, and, strange to say, he told
them who he was and how "slick" he
had walked out of jail and the crime
he was in for. He spent Sunday night
in the town and then walked away up
the railroad. When captured he had
come in from the hills to get something
to eat.

ttain pu'ed into this State an elderly
lady, nrmed Mrs. R. Richie. o n route
form Of k. and, Cal.. to Rock Island, ill.,
died in her berth. She was accompanied
by her granddaughter, a little 10-year old
girl. EcÂ« was sick all night, ami the

they could. Her remains were taken off
here and given in charge of the Coroner.
Tb#> little girl, whose name is Helen
Richie, was also detained here to testify
as to the circumstances attending the
grandmother's death.
Mrs. Richie lived at Rock Island, 111.,
and came to the coast four months ago
for the benefit of her health. She has
been living; at IS<V. Ellis street, San Fran

were all closed on December 16 for lack
of funds. School will open on February

MYSTERIOUS DEATH
IN A SEATTLE HOTEL
SEATTLE, Jan. 17.â Mrs. Hattie Curry,
wife of J. M. Curry of San Fran
cisco, died from an overdose of
morphine at the Hotel Stevens at 3
o'clock yesterday morning. She arrived
here on January 4 from California.
Dr. Sparling, the County Coroner, be
lieves now that she committed suicide.
Yesterday morning he was of the opinion
that death was accidental. All those per
sons who knew Mrs. Curry and her habits
are firmly of the opinion that her death
was the result of a large dose of morphine
taken to make her sleep. But Coroner
Sparling is so strongly of the opinion at
this time that Mrs. Curry swallowed the
morphine with suicidal intent that he
does not consider it necessary to hold an
inquest.
Mrs. Curry has been separated from
her husband for some time. He owned
a stone quarry at Yaquina Bay, Oregon,
and for many years made considerable
money, hut since then he lost everything,
for he telegraphed to the Coroner to-day
that he could not bury the remains.
Mrs*. Curry had a few days ago received
a letter from her husband, in which he
told her of his financial troubles and said
he could not take her back until she had
corrected some of her bad habits.
BONDING TIMBER CLAIMS.
Ninety Thousand Acres of Pine
Lands Secured by a Syndicate.
REDDING, Jan. 17.â A. D. Bartle, who
is engaged in bonding timber claims in
the McCloud River region for an Eastern
syndicate, left this city Sunday evening
for San Francisco to confer with finan
cial agents of the concern. It is stated
on the best of authority that Mr. Bartle
has successfully bonded 90,000 acres of
pine lands, extending into the White
Horse section of Modoc County. The com
pany which he represents has secured
the contract of the branch railroad put
ting out from the main line of the South
ern Pacific Company at Castle Crag sta
tion. The road was never completed by
the Red Cross Lumber Company, which
undertook the project. In the spring it
will be thrown forward into the heart of
the great timber reserve acquired by the
Eastern company and an extensive lum
bering enterprise will be carried on.
Timber claims have been bonded for
sums varying from $1280 per quarter sec
tion downward, it being stipulated in the
bonds that payments would be made by
the middle of February. This practically
untouched forest is said to be the finest
left in California.
TO PAY A CHURCH DEBT.
Generous Proposal Made by the Late
Judge Belcher's Widow.
MARYSVILLE, Jan. 17. â During his
lifetime the late Judge I. S. Belcher
evinced a deep interest In the welfare of
the First Presbyterian Church of Marys
ville and often expressed a desire to aid
in removing the debt on the church build
ing. Following his directions, made a
short time previous to his death, his wid
<>w has made an offer to the congrega
tion, which no doubt will be the means
of spurring on every member of the
cfiureh to bring about a release of TEe
property from the burdensome debt, at
present amounting to $3000.
For every $2 that the congregation will
raise Mrs. Belcher proposes to donate $1.
In other words, whenever the congrega
tion shall have raised $2000 toward paying
the debt she will contribute $1000.
Sale of Copper Mines.
REDDING, Jan. 17.â Articles of agree
ment have been filed with the County Re
corrier whereby the ownershtp of two
groups of copper mines on Backbone
Creek will pass into the hands of a Now
Tork syndicate upon the payment of $130,
--000 for one group and $30,000 for the other.
The deeds have been placed in escrow in
the Bank of Northern California. The
owners of the most extensive group are
B. Golinsky, Fritz Weischmann and Mat
thew Clendenin. The owners of the mines
sold for $30,000 are Eugenia J. Goss of San
Francisco, C. G. Ferguson and James
Fraser of this county. The Intermediary
is J. Park Charming of New York. A
force of men will be put at work at once
on both properties. It is believed that
this is the forerunner of another great
smelting plant for Shasta County.

FOB THE COLONIAL FAIR.
Congress Willl Be Asked to Appro-
priate Fifty Thousand.
A meeting of the board of directors' of
the Mechanics' Institute was held last
evening. During the meeting the prin
cipal business transacted was the adop
tion of a memorial, to be presented to
Congress, urging that a subsidy of $50,000
be granted for the furtherance of the
proposed Colonial Fair to be heldÂ« in this
city. It is the purpose of the institute
to illustrate at the fair the resources of
our newly acquired territory and other
Oriental "and Central American countries
with which we have business relations,
and it is proposed to lay the foundation
of a commercial museum in San Francis
co by turning over the exhibits after the
fair to the State Board of Trade or other
responsible body. Other commercial and
trade organizations have been invited to
sign the memorial and many of them have
already promised their support.
E. A. Denicke, J. P. Fraser and Rodney
Kendrick were appointed by the chair to
serve as the representation from the Me
chanics' Institute on the general commit
tee of the proposed Pacific Ocean Expo
sition, to be held in San Francisco in 1901.
Horace Wilson, George H. Wallis and P.
J. Healy were named as a committee to
meet the California Miners' Association
on the subject of the conservation of
water.
A resolution will be presented to the
members of Congress and the President
from the Mechanics" Institute urging that
a cable be constructed between this coast
and the Pacific possessions and that said
cable be of American manufacture.
TRIES TO IMPEACH ASHE.
One of Dennery's Henchmen Testifies
to Intimidation on the Part
of the Opposition.
The Dennery-Ashe Senatorial contest
was on the boards in Justice Groezin
ger's courtroom for a short time yester
day morning.
Mike Dunn was placed nn the stand to
Impeach Gaston Ashe. He testified that
any intimidation in the Forty-second Dis
trict was done by Gaston Ashe and At
torney McPike. and not by the plug-uglies
and shoulder-strikers who had been mak
ing Dennery's fight throughout election
day.
When Mr. ABhe was on the stand he tes
tified that it was as much as a man's life
was worth to remain in a booth where
Dennery's followers were massed, as they
would not hesitate to resort to force.

It used to be considered that only urinary troubles were to
be traced to the kidneys, but now modern science proves that
nearly all constitutional diseases have their beginning in the
disorder of these useful organs.
What more natural?
The Kidneys filter the blood.
"When they don't, your whole body
must suffer.
Thls, then, is the cause of all the dis-
eases which arise from poisonous blood

In the Divorce Courts.
Annie Murphy has been granted a di
vorce from Nicholas Murphy on the
ground of failure to provide. Debora
Meegan was granted a divorce yesterday
from Henry Meegan on the ground of
willful neglect. Suits for divorce have
been filed by M. McSherry against Lil
lian McSherry for desertion, and Kather
ine Cox against Oliver F. Cox for cruelty.
Tenacity of Life in the Jew.
At this point a surprising fact confronts
us. Despite the appearances of physical
degeneracy which we have noted, the
Jew betrays an absolutely unprecedented
tenacity of life. It far exceeds, especially
in the United States, that of any other
known people. This we may Illustrate
by the following example: Suppose two
sroups of one hundred infants each, one
ewish, one of average American parent
age (Massachusetts), to be born on the
came day. In spite of the disparity of
social conditions in favor of the latter,
the chances, determined by statistical
means, are that one-half of the Ameri
cans will die within forty-seven years,
while the first half of the Jews will not
succumb to disease or accident before the
expiration of seventy-one years. The
death rate Is really but little over half
that of the average American population.
This holds good in infancy as in middle
age. Lombroso has put it in another
way. Of 1000 Jews bom. 217 die before
the age of 7 years, while 453 Christians
more than twice as manyâ are likely to
die within the same period. This remark
able tenacity of life is well Illustrated by
a most suggestive article by Hoffman.â

Omdurman and Pumping Lead.
The fire of our soldiers In the recent
frontier war in India has been very good,
and all the officers who had been at Ora
durman agreed that our long-range rifle
fire there has been exceptionally accurate.
"If I were to describe the effect," said
Lord Wolseley, "of the volley firing, I
would say that from the moment the
enemy's line, an immense line virtually
and literally pumped lead upon came
within the zone of fire of 2000 yards, up to
the time when they ceased to advance,
because they were knocked down and
killed by the hundreds and thousandsâ
our line' virtually and literally pumped
lead into them. The fire was so heavy
that no one could live under it." This Is
quite true; disciplined volleys are a tre
mendous weapon both of offense and de
fense; but individual markmanship is also
of great importance, as doubtless Lord
Wolseley would be the first to admit.
Nothing so much depresses an enemy
awaiting an attack in partial shelter as
the knowledege that the instant a man ex
poses himseif he will get a bullet crashing
through his brain.

0 BROKEN DEADLOCK-
THE deadlock heretofore maintained between the
Police Court and the Police Department over
the arrc-t and prosecution of the pool-sellers
engaged in violating the municipal ordinances has
been broken by the issuance of warrants by three of
the Police Judges. The deadlock arose over the re
fusal of the Judges to issue warrants, and was pri
marily due to a disagreement between them as to
which particular Judge should decide the cases. The
matter has been settled by a division of the business,
and it is presumed that the work of prosecution will
now go on uninterruptedly.
It ought to be said at this juncture, however, that
the mere issuance of warrants and the arrest of the
poolroom proprietors will not of themselves suppress
the evil. If the Police Judges do not perform their
duty when these violators of the law are brought be
fore them there will be a practical indorsement of
the evil. A powerful influence is always exerted to
perpetuate these dens of iniquity. They are money
making contrivances. Their proprietors are politi
cians, and in robbing the fool public they are sus
tained in a measure by the political classes. But there
is no apparent reason why their pulls should be po
tent in the Police Court. The Judges of that tribunal
are elected to mete out justice without regard to the
personal influence of culprits, and if they permit the
pulls of the poolroom operators to enter their courts
they ought to be made subjects of inquiry by the
Grand Jury.
The evil inflicted upon the community by the pool-
room nuisance is greater than any that is exerted by
ordinary gambling devices. The poolrooms corrupt
riot the practiced gambler, but the youth and inno
cence of the town. They are deadfalls, into which the
unwary are. enticed and in which messenger-boys and
women are encouraged to cultivate a spirit of gam
bling.
Xo mercy should be shown the owners of these
dens, and in dealing with them the Police Judges may
â¢ well disregard all mitigating circumstances. A man
â  '"who establishes a poolroom for the sale of chances on
â¢ horse races goes deliberately into the business of cor
. rupting the community, and there is but one way to
.deal with him, and that is with all the severity allowed
by law.
We hope the Police Judges will sustain the Police
Department in enforcing the anti-poolroom or
dinances. If they will follow up their warrants with
genuine prosecutions, in which all the evidence
against the poolrooms is brought out, they will earn
the gratitude of the law-abiding portion of the com
munity anjd lay up capital which will benefit them
hereafter. Nothing can reflect so much credit upon
them as a genuine attempt to co-operate with the Po
lice Department in this matter.
LET NO GUILTY MON ESCAPE.
IT is a subject for sad reflection that a son of the
President who in his incorruptible maintenance of
justice warned the officers of the law on a noted
occasion to "let no guilty man escape" is now
himself involved in a scandal the investigation of
which must be undertaken and carried out in the spirit
of those memorable words. Justice, however, is no
respecter of persons, neither does it turn aside for
sentiment. It demands of the investigating commit
tee at Sacramento that no man guilty of violating the j
laws of the State be allowed to go unpunished.
It was a maxim of old Rome, "The Judge is con
demned when the guilty are absolved." So will it be
with the investigating committee if it go about its
work in a formal and merely perfunctory way; if it
show any sign of trying to shield any one, high or
low, from the consequences of guilt; if it hesitate in j
the path of duty; if it permit evasions or quibbles, or j
technicalities, to be pleaded successfully as bars to the
disclosure of truth.
The members of the committee may as well under- i
stand that they as well as the accused Speaker are on j
trial. What they do will be noted throughout the j
State; nor will anything they may leave undone in I
the performance of duty be overlooked. The people j
demand a comprehensive and thorough investigation 1
of the offenses that have been disclosed by The Call j
and confirmed by evidence collected by other journals j
of the State. The Speaker of the Assembly stands
charged of gross violations of law, .and prominent
candidates for high office are involved with him. The :
issue is not one that can be huddled over. The cvi- |
dence cannot be hushed up. There is no ground for
compromise. The committee must condemn the guilty
01 be itself condemned.
There is no desire on the part of the people to per- j
secute any person. No injustice is aimed at any legis
lator, candidate or lobbyist. There is no demand for j
a scapegoat. Indignation has been aroused by the
disclosures made, but it has not affected the popular j
judgment. The people are capable of giving an im
partial consideration to the subject and will weigh the !
evidence calmly, but they demand that all the facts
be brought out fully and fairly. They wish the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth. They
look to the investigating committee to accomplish
that, and will be satisfied with nothing less.
EXPANSION AND THE CONSTITUTION.
PHILIP THE GOOD of Burgundy, not long be
fore his son, Charles the Bold, had entailed
upon the Netherlands what Motley calls "the
curse of a standing army ( " succeeded in strad
dling an awkward dilemma. Having substituted his
elastic conscience for the ancient constitution and
privileges of the country, he dispossessed his grand-
daughter, Jacqueline, of three provinces, and estab
lished at Bruges the Order of the Golden Fleece,
which represented at once the staple production of
the Netherlands and the Christian humility of the
twenty-five emperors, kings, princes and nobles
who were the original or charter members. After
having proclaimed our disinterestedness and our
strict integrity in declaring war against Spain, if we
should not only violate our official pledges but cast
aside our constitution like a wet rag in order to hold
Asiatic dependencies and reduce nine millions of
Filipinos to serfdom or graft them into American
citizenship by military power, we ought to perfect our
resuscitation of the fifteenth century and by some
invention vindicate the consistency of our theories,
antagonized by our practice. If we desire to occupy
the same relation toward the Spanish colonies that
Spain occupied toward the Netherlands, doubtless we
can found an order composed of at least twenty-five
generals and politicians, who will fairly illustrate our
imperialism on the one hand and our Americanism on
the other. Constitutional inhibition of course will not
stand in the way, and it might not be inappropriate to
include a few of the journalists who have a "national
policy." If these contradictory attitudes can be suc
cessfully maintained we can spread the new hybrid
of American imperialism over other territory not oc
cupied or witTiin the "sphere of influence" of Euro
pean powers until we can complacently announce that
"as one gathereth eggs that are left, have we gath
ered all the earth."
An accurate but shallow view of the existing situa
tion would encourage the pessimists who deny the
capacity of the American people for self-government
and who predict a speedy disruption of the Union,
through causes generated within itself. But our na
tional history contradicts and falsifies these gloomy
anticipations. In every emergency, while the people
were slow and apparently apathetic at first, settled
public opinion, expressed through the ballot-box, has
turned out right in the end. It took nearly five years
to secure a national guarantee for the abolition of
slavery and the perpetuity of the Union, and much
longer before sectional discords were annihilated and
political unity developed into a universal sentiment
as well as an accomplished fact. In the elections of
1896 and 1898 hard sense conquered passion, aroused
by real evils, and by theories that were captivating to
lestless and uninstructed minds. And now, in the
press, in colleges and universities, by conservative
statesmen and great thinkers, in the halls of legisla
tion and among the toiling masses, who represent
muscular and mechanical industry, the reaction
against the drift toward imperialism has begun, and,
day by day, grows more intense and demonstrative.
It is not likely to recede, and both capital and labor
will probably realize that our own continent supplies
abundant fields for enterprise, that there is no dis
content nor suppressed energy at home that demands
cutlets abroad, and that our great republic may safely
retain its distinctive features, preserve its unity under
the constitution, and, through educated and discip
lined citizenship, work out to its final results the most
beneficent and the most logical plan that has ever
been devised for the benefit of the human race.
THE TIME FOR ACTION.
F any argument in favor of the prompt passage of
a bill to promote our merchant marine were
* needed in addition to that furnished by the de
mand for ships to carry our increasing export trade
it would be found in an official report to the Treasury
Bureau of Statistics of a recent subsidy agreement by
which the German Government proposes to pay
more than a million dollars a year for a fifteen year
term for the establishment of steamship lines between
German ports and those of Japan, China, Australasia
and certain ports of Oceanica.
From a summary of the report which has beep
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUAKY 18, 1899.
given out it appears that four steamers are, under this
contract, to be built for the Chinese and Japanese ser
vice, to be of not less than 6000 tons and equal to
those of foreign nations in every respect, their plans
to be approved by the Admiralty, and to be running
I respectively by October 1, 1890, January I, September
I 1 and November 1, 1900. The steamers to be con
! structed for the Australian line are to be not less than
: 5300 tons and also equal to those of foreign na
j tions in every respect and subject to the approval of
! the Admiralty. All the ships are to be built in Ger
man yards, and German material is to be used as far
as possible, all Admiralty requirements to be carried
I out in them, putting them into condition in which
i they can readily be utilized for war purposes when
necessary.
The trade of the Pacific Ocean is well worth the
I high price the Germans are bidding for it, and the
exercise of all the energies they are putting forth.
Recently issued statistics from British sources esti
mate there is a foreign trade amounting to $205,000,
--; 000 in the Dutch East Indies, of $32,500,000 in the
; Philippines, of $25,000,000 in Hawaii, and of about
: $,500,000,000 in all the inlands combined. The inter
national trade of Australia, Tasmania and New Zea
j land amounts to $680,000,000 annually. The foreign
! commerce of treaty ports of China and Hongkong is
1 estimated at about $416,500,000; of Burmah and Brit-
I iÂ«h India, $1,000,000,000; of Japan, $200,000,000, and
I with Korea, Eastern Siberia, Siam, French Indo
j China, Straits Settlements and the Malay Peninsula
: the foreign commerce of the Asiatic Pacific reaches
the enormous total of $2,145,000,000.
As a great manufacturing and exporting nation the
I United States have a large interest in the . Pacific
! Ocean trade. As a matter of fact we are the greatest
! of Pacific Ocean powers and ought to dominate its
! commerce. We will never do so, however, as long as
we rely npon foreign ships to carry our goods for us
; and make no effort to build up a merchant marine of
' our own.
The Germans have set an example which we will
follow if we are wise. There would be no waste of
money in building up a large fleet of merchant steam
ers on the Pacific Ocean. From the activity of Euro
pean nations in striving for the trade it will be seen
there is little time to lose. The issue is urgent, and
should be dealt with at this session of Congress.
DURING our Revolutionary War the Continental
Congress made with France a commercial
treaty offensive and defensive, pledging amity
and comity and promising certain exclusive trade
rights and a military alliance, with the use of our ports
and prize courts for France in maritime warfare.
That treaty put our flag alongside that of the Bour
bons. It brought to us the French allies, who re
mained fighting by our side down to the final surren
der at Yorktown. Four years thereafter we organized
our government under the present constitution and
elected Washington President We were not long in
discovering that trade did not follow the flag nor the
treaty. The people of England, from whom we had
just separated ourselves, proved to be our best cus
tomers, and, in violation of our solemn treaty
with France, trade overrode all diplomacy and re
mained in its natural channel. This continued in spite
of our second war with Great Britain. It was demon
strated that neither prejudice nor friendship affected
trade in the least. It followed its natural cleavage.
Gratitude made no impression upon it, and it was
equally insusceptible to passion and revenge.
So it has continued to this day. .Abuse of Great
Britain has affected our politics and been a controlling
factor in electing more than one President. The
surest sesame to the sympathy and applause of an
American audience has always been an impassioned
appeal against Great Britain. Political campaigns
have turned on the charge that "British gold" at
tempted to influence them. Yet trade has gone on
with Great Britain entirely uninfluenced by these fer
ments in politics and these appeals to national
hatred.
It is somewhat strange that with this example con
stantly before us there should be heard the foolish
talk about trade following the flag!
We are asked to expend hundreds of millions of
dollars in "nailing the flag" to various parts of the
world that trade may follow it. We are told that an
rnnual expenditure of a hundred and fifty millions on
an enlarged army and navy to nail the flag and keep
it nailed on certain tropical islands is necessary to
nail trade where the flag is nailed.
Up to the close of the fiscal year ending June 30,
1898, we had not nailed the flag anywhere, and had
not turned our backs on the humanitarian professions
we made when we declared war against Spain. Great
Britain, on the other hand, had at that date been en
paged for two centuries in nailing her flag in nu
r jrous islands, continents and archipelagoes all over
the world. She had it that moment nailed to a
thousand battleships and a countless fleet of mer
chantmen. If trade refuse to follow anything but a
flag Great Britain should have had seven-tenths of the
world's commerce. But Mr. Ritchie, president of the
Rritish Board of Trade, says that while the imports
of Great Britain had increased to $850,000,000 over her
exports, the latter had declined. Since 1891 the ex
ports of France had increased 2V2 per cent, with her
flag nailed to very few places. The exports of Ger
many, Holland and Belgium had grown 12Y2 per cent,
with no new flag-nailing at all, and very few old jobs
of that kind. The exports of the United States had at
the same time increased 18 per cent, while those of
Great Britain had decreased 5 per cent. In our ex
port relations to Great Britain for that period we had
therefore gained on her 23 per cent, had overtaken
and passed her, and had seen her countermarch and
increase the distance between s. All this was done
without the sacrifice of a life to the ambition to nail
the flag anywhere. No fever-smitten man had closed
.bis eyes for the last time under a vertical sun to ex
tend the trade of his country by lifting the flag in
strange regions. No penny of extra taxation had been
laid on American lab.or. Trade, following its natural
path, at its normal pace, blind to all flags and thrilled
by no standard, saluting no battle banner, asking no
battleships to convoy it and no army to protect it,
had gone on and left Great Britain so far in the rear
that she will not overtake us unless we lose our
senses and go into flag-nailing at the expense of
our legitimate business.
There is about as much connection between the flag
and trade as there is between chewing gum and the
precession of the equinoxes.
Ulysses Grant Jr. should remember that his father
obtained the honors of his country by deserving them,
and. not by.putting money where it would do the least
good. â  ._;. ' ; â *â

original packages. In fact, it now appears
that it id "all up" with the hundreds of
small manufacturers of cigars and several
thousands of cigar-makers who have di
rectly or indirectly been making a fair
living under the old system. In times past
small manufacturers of cigars in this city
purchased their material from the to
bacco dealers in such quantities as the
trade demanded and their means permit
ted. In this way they were able to get
a few pounds at a time, give work to one,
two or even half a dozen cigar-makers.
make their sales and buy more for anoth
er lot.
The ruling of the Commissioner the
other day made this impossible, the or
der being that tobacco must be sold by
the dealers in the original packages. As
these packages, cases and bundles cost
from $200 to 1600 and several different
kinds are sometimes necessary to effect
desired blends capital amounting some
times to several thousand dollora is re
quired.
As may be expected the small makers
in this city were greatly alarmed and at
once took such means as lay in their
power to call the attention of the Com
missioner to the injustice done them and
the disastrous results that would follow.
The officers of the Chamber of
Commerce, the City and State Boards
of Trade, the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' and Merchants' associations at
once became interested, for they had rea
lized that to throw 2000 cigar-makers out
of employment would be to drag three
times that number of persons dependent
upon that business down to the lowest
stages of poverty. The thought of the
community having to provide for the dis
tress of euch a number was so appalling
that the commercial people at once placed
themselves in communication with the
powers that be at Washington to see if
the unjust ruling could not be modified.
An examination of the statutes convinced
them that there was some hope, as shown
by the following dispatch that was sent
last Saturday by the presidents of the
bodies mentioned:
SAX FRANCISCO, Jan. 14, 1899.
To the Honorable Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, Washington, D. C. â Sir: Treasury
decision No. 20,372, prohibiting the sale of leaf
tobacco in quantities less than a bale, case,
etc., seems to be in conflict with the follow
ing language contained in subdivision 6 of
section 3244, Revised Statutes:
"Provided it shall bfe lawful for any licensed
manufacturer of cigars to purchase leaf to
bacco of any licensed dealer or other manu
facturer In quantities less than the original
packages for use in his own manufactory ex
clusively."
In considering the matter your attention had
probably not been directed to this clear and
unambiguous statutory provision, and conse
quently it must have been overlooked. Would
you please re-investigate the question as speed
ily as possible, and In the meantime order a
suspension of proceedings on that decision?
We call your attention to the fact that the
remaining in force of your ruling will virtu
ally destroy the cigar manufacturing Industry
in this State, and entail great distress upon
thousands of employes and their families.
Their hopes were dashed to the earth
yesterday by the receipt of a telegram
from headquarters which shows that the
ruling must have been made in the inter
ests of the wealthy manufacturers of
cigars, who in the past have done all in
their power to monopolize the cigar busi
ness. Ths is the dispatch:
Mr. Hugh Craig, President Chamber of Com
merce, San Francisco, January 16, ISS9: Section
69 of the act of August 2S, lSi)4, repeals in part
subdivision 6, section 3244. Increased rates of
tax on tobacco products enforces a more care
ful supervision over the sale and disposition
of leaf tobacco. Treasury decisions 20,260 and
20,394 afford manufacturers ample opportunity
to purchase from other manufacturers, under
special permit authorizing sale, small quanti
ties of unstemmed, stemmed, resweated or
booked leaf tobacco.
G. W. WILSON, Acting Commissioner.
The clause to the effect that the small
manufacturers may secure all the tobacco
they want from the large manufacturers
might as well never have been inserted,
for It Is not at all likely that the larger
makers of cigars will furnish the smaller
makers with the material with which to
compete for trade In the open market.
The former cannot be compelled to sell,
and there Is nothing for the unfortunates
to do but close up shop, unless the entire
business communities of this and every
city in the Union unite in a general de
mand for the repeal of the Commission
er's unfair ruling. It is stated that to
throw the small cigar-makers of the
United States out of employment would
cause more distress than has been experi
enced for years and extend over more
territory. ______________

was Monday.
There were light showers yesterday at

DR. O'BRIEN RETURNS
TO HIS CIVIL DUTIES
THE GALLANT SURGEON OF THE
FIRST AT HIS POST.
Resumes the Position of Health Offi- i
cer After Meritorious Service
at Manila â Dr. Gallwey's
Self-Sacrifice.
Dr. A. P. O'Brien will resume his duties
as Health Officer of this city this morn
ing after an absence of eight months.
"When President McKinley called for
volunteers last spring Dr. O'Brien was i
among the first to respond, sacrificing j
much for his country from a material
point of view. He went to Manila last
May and rendered distinguished service,
for which he has been praised by the I
highest authorities. Notable among his ;
humanitarian acts was his work in the
smallpox hospital. He braved the dan
gers of the dread disease, and upon his j
assumption of control the list of fa- i
talities commenced to grow rapidly less.
This was but one of his achievements in
the far away Philippines.
Upon his arrival here he applied to the
department at Washington tor his dis- |
charge. Contrary to expectations an im
mediate answer was received to the effect
that a leave of absence would be granted
him until February 15, at which time he
would be honorably discharged. Few men
have been granted discharges under these
conditions, and it is believed the he;i>.
the army were aware of the distinguished
service rendered by Dr. O'Brien, hence
their action upon his application.
During his absence his office has been
ably filled by Dr. John Gallwey. He as
sumed the duties ei~ht months ago this |
morning, and has been unremitting in his
attentions to the demands of the office
ever since. He accepted the office upon
the condition that the salary which at
taches, $250 a month, should go to the
family of the absent officer. At times the
demands of his own extensive practice and I
the other duties he had assumed seemed :
more than he could master, but he ful
filled all his obligations to his patients â 
and to the public, and proved his loyalty <
to his friend.

Supreme Justices Mak an Important !
Decision on Homestead Law.
The Justices of the Supreme Court have
given the Judge of the Superior Court of
Sonoma County some interesting law to
ponder upon. The case in which this in
formation was given was that of John
J. Silvia, who made application for a writ
of habeas corpus. A divorce case is pend
ing in Santa Rosa between Silvia and
his wife, and the Judge ordered the hus
band to give the wife $205 alimony and
counsel fees. Silvia failed to obey the
order, claiming that he had no money,
whereupon the Judge insisted that the
money could be raised by the husband
I selling or putting a mortgage upon home
steaded land that he held. Upon the ad
vice of his attorney Silvia declined to do
so, and he was adjudged to be guilty of I
contempt of court and to be imprisoned j
in the County Jail until he complied- with j
the order. A petition for a writ -of
habeas corpus followed, which was de- j
cided by the court in bank ordering Sil
via's release, Justice McFarland dissent
ing. The court says:
"In this case the first .order of imprison
ment did contain a recital that the peti
tioner was able to pay the alimony in
question, but upon a subsequent proceed
ing in habeas corpus before the same I
court, in which his ability to pay was the
principal question to be determined, the
order remanding him, and under which
he is now held, fails to show that he is
able to pay without selling or incumber
ing his homestead, and the question is
presented whether a man can be com
pelled by duress of imprisonment to sell
or incumber the homestead which under I
the constitution and laws of the State j
jis exempt from forced sale except in
certain enumerated cases, of which pay- .
ment of temporary alimony is not one.
"In our opinion this cannot be done.
The prisoner having no means aside
from his homestead in a legal sense has
not the ability to pay the alimony, and his
continued imprisonment is unlawful. It
is ordered that he be discharged from
custody." - .:.",-:

ONE YEAR'S
RECORD OF
PROGRESS
Views of Mr. Craig on
Current Events.
THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
INSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS AT
ITS YEARLY MEETING.
The Retiring President Believes tha
Semi-Centennial Exposition
Will Be a Grand
Event.
The annual meeting of the trustees of
the Chamber of Commerce was held yes
terday, at which the old board of officers
retired and the new trustees whose
names were published at the election took
their seats. E. Scott was re-elected by
the board to the position he has filled so
well for the past year or more. W. M.
Bunker stated that he is about to visit
Siberia over the projected line of the
great Siberian railway, and he was elect
ed as a special commissioner to repre
sent the chamber. The retiring president,
Hugh Craig, presented a long report
showing the work of the chamber during
the past year and the general condition
of the city and State. Special mention
was made of the condition of the
crops of the present year and those of
the past two seasons. Also the amount
of exports of cereals to all parts of the
globe. The business of the banks, be said,
is entirely satisfactory. Of the class
known as farm borrowers the report
says:
This class of debtors during 1597 paid interest
equal to the amount accruing in one and one
half yearn, thereby clearing up arrearage's in
great degree. In 1898 they,- as a class, held
their own, some localities wiping out old bal
ances, while others ran behind again. Small
City borrowers are paying interest promptly
as a rule.
Of several other matters of interest Mr.
Craig's view? were expressed as follows:
Trans-Paoiflc Cableâ "tt'e may confidently ex
pect a movement toward the construction of
this much-desired convenience before the year
la much older. The President of the L'nlted
States is very anxious that this shall be ac
complished, at least to Hawaii, immediately.
Nicaragua Canalâ lt would appear at thi3
writing as if the long-desired passage-way
between the Atlantic and Pacific for the pro
tection of the commerce of the two coasts of
the rnitod States is now fairly within reach.
Legislation in favor of the immediate con
struction of the canal should be well forward,
if not an accomplished fact, before the Fifty
fifth Congress expire* on March 4.
Cable to the FRrallonesâ Every effort should
be made to securing this most desirable ac
quisition for the convenience of our shipping
and weather bureau. The Secretary of Agri
culture has favorably reported as to cost and
practicability, and our delegation at Washing
ton is alive to the necessity.
Mr. Craig made special reference to the
manufactures of iron, the success of this
city in supplying the army during the
late war, pure food laws, railroad trans
portation, prompt delivery of ocean
mails, the Philadelphia museum, the Pre
sidio Reservation, conservation of water
and the preservation of the forests of the
State and current affairs in general. Of
the semi-centennial exposition of the
State he said:
In the year 1900 we will have reached the
semi-centennial anniversary of etatehood. Cali
fornia is the leading State in the Pacific ter
ritory of the United States. A celebration of
California's fiftieth anniversary will be heart
ily concurred in by other States and Terri
tories lying wÂ»Bt of the Missouri River. The
occasion is one which should be accentuated
In a fitting manner. The Government of the
Vnlted States has. up to the present time, ap
propriated the sum of $8,600,000 in aid of ex
positions of the material resources of the
United States and of the various sections of
the country. The most recent instance of its
munificence in this regard relates to the Trans-
Mississippi Exposition, just closed at Omaha.
A Brand exposition of the resources of the
Pacific Coast, to be known as the Pacific Ocean
Exposition, should be hf-Ul In San Francisco,
and on its behalf Government aid should be
solicited, whilp the city and thf Ptate should
make liberal appropriations on its behalf.

Dense Fog.
Sank to Her Deck and Was
Towed to Port.
She Carried the Crew of the
Ill=Fated Jewel.
No Lives Were Lost and No
Excitement.
flow the Jewel Went Ashore
at Caspar.
Thrilling Story Told by Her
Engineer.
THE steamer Noyo narrowly escaped
becoming a total wreck on Duxbury
Reef early yesterday morning. She
was on her way here from Fort
Bragg with a load of lumber and a num
â  bÂ«r of passengers, when she struck the
r<->rks. It was very foggy, and Captain
Daniels thought he was a good three
miles off the rinngcrous reef, but the re
cent storm had created a strong north
â â 'â¢â â  -easterly set, and that carried the Noyo to
. -.the rocks.
â¢ '. ; . There was no excitement on the vessel.
The captain and first and second officers
V were on the l ridge at the time, and when
.-..'.the passengers came rushing on deck they
: ; assured them there was no danger. The
â steamer worked her way over the reef,
and when she was about a mile to the
.''"southward the anchor was dropped, as
: .the rudder was damaged and the Noyo
.: . â¢â .unmanageable.
"â¢ :' Besides her crew, the Noyo had on
'â¢â ' board thirteen passengers, two of whom
â ;â¢. were ladies, and fourteen of the crew of
â ..the wrecked steamer Jewel, that went
/^ashore near Caspar during the recent
;â¢â¢â¢. southeaster and became a total wreck.
â¢.'â¢;-â  As soon as Captain Daniels ascertained
: , /that his vessel was leaking badly he or
â â¢â .â /dered the boats lowered, and the passen
; . &ers and their effects put into them. Cap
.'. . tain Daniels was in charge of one. First
Officer Kendal of the second. Second Of
,: ficer Nelson of the third and Chief Engi
neer Thompson of the fourth.
â  The distress signals blown on the Noyo's
\ steam whistle had attracted the attention
' of the crew of the fishing steamer Henri
â¢ etta. Owing to the fog, the captain of
'â 'â 'â  the Henrietta could not see the Noyo, but
â¢â¢..â 'be knew that something was in trouble on
â  Duxbury Reef, bo he sent a boat to find
out what was the matter. Two of the
'â¢. Noyo's boats saw the stranger and pulled
'.-â¢".â  toward her. As soon as the fishermen
"â¢'.learned what was the matter they re
â â¢ turned to their own steamer, and the
:'--Nbyo's boats followed. Two of them got
â .'â¢'â¢'alongside the Henrietta, and the passen
:''gers in them got aboard the fisherman.
/The captain of the Henrietta did not wait
â â â . -for the other boats to come up, but saying
'.'he was in a hurry, steamed away for San
;â¢. â¢ .Francisco.
â ''â  ' ' By noon the Noyo had become water
?' ..lodged. She lay with a list to starboard,
; 'afrd the water was up to her hurricane
â¢ .deck. The deckload of lumber began to
â  drift away, and altogether she was in a
â 'â . -bad positon when the tug Alert put in an
' ; :appearance. Captain Daniels did not
â¢ : -.Vwaste any time dickering about a price,
-.rbut when Captain John Silovlch said,
:â¢ "Shall 1 take hold, captain?" he answered
â¢ 'once. "Yes, tow her in as quickly as
â â -.â¢â you- can."
:':'' When the Alert and her unwieldy tow

engine-room until the water was up to
their waists, and did everything in .their
power to keep things going.

Harry Harrington, one of the firemen of
the Noyo, came ashore on the Henrietta
"SuJfoV watch and asleep In my bunk
when we struck." said he when talking
about the matter. "There was no con
fusion or excitement, and we all had time
to dress and go on deck before there was
any talk of lowering the boats. It was
fully half an hour after we struck that
the "boats were lowered. We pulled away
from the Novo and ran across a boat be
longing to the fishing steamer Henrietta.
The two Italians in the boat hailed us
and told us to follow them. The Hen
rietta was lying a mile to the south of us,
so we pulled for her. Captain Sandstrom
thought that we were all that were to
go ashore and at once started for San
Francisco.
"Captain Daniels deserves great praise
for the manner in which he handled
things during the wreck. He was cool
and collected, and kept the boats along
side until the passengers' baggage was
put into them. In order to do this great
care had to be taken, as there was a
good swell on and the boats might have
been swamped.
"There were two women in our boat.
One was a Miss Royal from Fort Bragg.
She thought the whole thing a great joke
and could hardly be pursuaded to leave
the wreck. Her trunk fell overboard
while it was being put into the boat, and
It took nearly the entire ship's crew to
recover it. The other lady was with her
husband and she was not a bit frightened.
Some of the Jewel's men lost all their
clothes and they played in very hard
luck. To be wrecked twice in one week
is something that does not often happen,
and yet that was the experience or the
crew of the Jewel."
The Noyo was built in San Francisco in
IW. but practically made into a new ves
sel at a cost of over $15,000 less than a
month ago. She was overhauled from
sum to stern, her bow was built up, her
engines made as good as new, the cabins
put in first-class order, and when com
pleted she was one of the finest steam
schooners on the coast. She now lies a
â wreck on the Mission mud fiats. Over
60,000 feet of her load of lumber is gone,
her deckhouses are sprung, the railing is
gone, and just what damage the hull has
sustained will not be known until the ves
sel goes on the drydock. The Noyo is
150 feet long, 33.2 feet broad and 10.5 feet
deep. She is owned by J. S. Kimball &
Co.. who also owned the steamer Pro
tection, which was wrecked off the
Columbia River a few weeks ago.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1899.
WRECKED ON DUXBURY REEF.
WHILE on her way from Fort Bragg to this port with a cargo of lum
ber and passengers the steamer Noyo went on the reef in a fog.
Captain Daniels thought he was three miles away from danger, but
a heavy northeasterly set had been put in motion by the recent south
easters and his vessel went on the rocks before he knew she was out of
her course. The crew and passengers were taken off, and the Noyo later
was beached on the Mission mud flats.
Noyo on Duxbury reef just north of this
port, yesterday morning, exemplify one or
possibly all of the three misfortunes.
They left the Jewel grinding: to splinters
on the rocks to board the Noyo, only to
abandon the latter craft as she banned
and thumped on the reef later on. How
ever, it is the common ill-luck, only this
is a little more co, of folks who go down
to the sea in ships.
Louis Peacock and William Home, en
gineers of the Jewel, were the special
sufferers and heroes of the first disaster.
The former survived to pass again safely
through the second wreck, while Home
died from his Injuries an>- lies in his
grave at Caspar.
When the Jewel went ashore Home was
on watch In the engine-room, while Chief
Engineer Peacock was asleep In his state
room. At the first crash of the vessel on
the rocks he awoke and, springing- from
his berth, made his way with great diffi

breaking over the floundering steamer
and the 240,000 feet of lumber on deck and
in the hold was beginning to smash the
bulkheads into kindling-wood. The chief
found the machinery still working, but
the engineer was lying in the shaft
alley.
He had been hurled against the revolv
ing crank and his leg was broken. The
â teamer immediately commenced to break
up and the lights went out, leaving the
engine room in darkness. Down into the
place poured the water, and the little
room was soon awash.
Peacock helped his companion climb up
near the door, which was jammed by the
deck load of lumber, which was batter-
Ing down on the engine house, or hatch,
and from their position they could hear
the flooded machinery still working aown
in the Trnter. Presently the engine was
stopped by the bursting of the steam
pipes, and the scalding vapor enveloped
the two men. They could not escape, and
caged in that horrible place they were
apparently doomed.
In the thunder of the 'waves and the
grinding of the cargo of lumber thc-y
could hear no voices from the outside.
Some time had elapsed since the steamer
first struck, and apparently they were
alone on tho fast crumbling vessel.
Presently a violent lurch of the hulk
separated the two engineers, and Peacock
was hurled bodily through a splintered
partition into the cook's galley on to the
heated range, which burned his left shoul
der and arm severely. He had escaped
the stifling, steam-filled engine room, but
only to find himself in a dark, narrow
apartment whose space was almost all
taken up by a big, hot range. Every
heave of the wreck would pitch him
against the stove. He had jumped from
his berth clad only in -undershirt and
drawers, and when driven through the
broken partition bulkhead he had lost
most of even that scant covering.

est man, and does not care to speak of

his awful adventure In the galley and
engine-room of the wrecked Jewel during
the horrors of that stormy morning, nor
is he in a mental condition to talk of his
battle for life.
"I don't want to say much about it,"
said he last evening. "Two shipwrecks
within a few days of each other is more
than one man's share, and, moreover, I
don't want the boys to say I came ashore
and put in my time talking about it. I
don't want to pose aa the one who got the
lion's Bhare of any glory. I got into a
hole, and simply did my best to get out.
But I tell you when I found myself cooped
In that galley with the door Jammed shut i
I gave up the fight. I thought of my wife !
at home In San Francisco and I prayed
for her. I considered myself beyond the
help of even prayer, but I prayed for my
wife. Then I thought of the men, and I
prayed for them too. All my prayers wei% i
answered except the one for poor Billy '
Homo."
lAke the engine-room the galley began :
to fill, and the Imprisoned engineer was
forced high up on a locker, where he
clung. Inch by inch the flood crept up to
him till only the upper part of his body
was above the incoming sea. But the
waters outside were battering and scat- j
tering the wreck. At last the side of the â 
galloy was smashed in and the water j
washed him out on deck. He landed |
close to Home, who was wedged between j
a pile of lumber and the deck. He had :
received more Injuries, being crushed by
the shifting heavy timbers and was help
lees.
Again Peacock went to his rescue, and
â¢with the assistance of several of the
crew he was extricated from his position. |
They all clung to the wreck, and when j
daylight came all made their way through
the breakers to the shore.
First Officer Charles Sehillinsky took i
the helpless and almost unconscious form '
of Home on his back and literally fought
for both of their lives in the passage .
through the heavy surf to the beach. It
was an heroic struggle and a battle nobly 'â¢
won. but it was in vain, for the crushed \
engineer could not survive his terrible in
junes.
The officers and crew of the lost Jewel
took passage in the Noyo for home and
were acain cast away almost within sight j
of their destination on Duxbury Reef, i
but that may be considered another story.
Home was a native of Scotland, agrd 46.
and unmarried. He lived at the home of
Engineer Peacock, 412 A Bryant street.
At the time Peacock landed from the
wrecked Jewel he was dressed in a few
shreds of a pair of drawers and a portion
of one sleeve of his undershirt. In this
light attire he made his way over the
rocks, his feet lacerated and bleeding,
seeking assistance for Home, who was
then dying on vie beach. When the brave
engineer reached the door of his home
yesterday morning he sat down on the
steps and cried like a childâ the first
tears from the man who had two ship
wrecks thrust upon him.
WALES 1 PHYSICIAN
OK CONSUMPTION
Sir William Broadbent Says Consump
tion Is Contagions and Curable
Hot Necessarily Hereditary.
AGREES WITH SLOCUM METHODS
At a Meeting In London the Prince of Wales'
Physician Fully Confirms Dr. Slocum's
Teachings on This Disease.
LONDON, Jan. 17.â A meeting of the
National Society for the Prevention of
Consumption and other forms of Tuber
cular diseases, held at Marlbomugh
House December 20, was presided over
by the Prince of Wales, and addressed
by Lord Salisbury and Btr William
Broadbent, physician to the Prince of
Wales.
Dr. Broadbent adheres to the view
that consumption is not necessarily
hereditary, but a contagious disease,
and is therefore curable by a treatment
which will destroy the germs and build
up the system.
lie thus agrees with Dr. Slocmn in
every particular and his address is a
practical Indorsement of the system of
treatment followed out so successfully
by this well-known practitioner.
Dr. Slocum felt sure, when he first
announced his theory, based on scien
tific experiments and practice, that con
sumption is a germ' disease and not ne
cessarily a hereditary taint, that the
whole medical world would in time ac
knowledge that he was right.
In Sir William Broadbent Dr. Slocum
has an ally who will be of great assist
ance in teaching the people the real
nature of consumption, its prevention
and its cure.
The first thing necessary, as these
two great physicians show, Is the kill
ing of the Kerms of the disease â and
then the strengthening and building up
of the system.
This is Just the theory upon which
the Dr. Slocum New Treatment for
Consumption, Lung Weakness and the
Crip is based. The germs of consump
tion, grip, etc., enter the body through
the nose and mouth in breathing, and
pass down the respiratory canal to the
lungs.
Dr. Slocum's medicines disinfect the
system from the nostrils to- the deepest
passages of the lungs, both by contact
with the mucous membrane and
through the blood, thus killing the
germs. His medicines also furnish food
with which to build up the wasted
tissues, and fortify the system against
renewed attacks of the terrible mi
crobes.
It was announced at this meeting in
London, referred to above, that Wern
her & Beit, the South African finan
ciers and diamond mine owners, had
given $100,000 for the erection of a Sani
tarium for Consumption.
The thousands of Americans who are
using this famous system, and the
thousands who have been cured by it,
will be interested in the fact that the
scientific principles embodied in the Dr.
Slocum's New System of Treatment
have been so highly indorsed by Sir
William Broadbent, the eminent physi
cian to the royal family.
Dr. Slocum's offer to send free medi
cine to sufferers from theÃe dreadful
germ diseases has at last borne fruit,
and others are beginning to join with
him In the work of ridding the world of
Its greatest and most dangerous
scourge.
He will still continue the distribution
of the three free bottles comprising the
complete course of his new system of
treatment so universally known as a
positive cure for all diseases of throat
and lungs.
Every reader of The Call who has
consumption, grip, weak lungs, catarrh
or any form of lung or throat or bron
chial weakness, or any wasting chronic
complaint, whir sends name and full ad
dress to or calls at The Doctor Slocum
American Laboratories, 96 and 98 Pine
street. New York City, stating that he
read this article in the San Francisco
Cnll will receive these three free bottles
with full instructions for self treatment
and free advice adapted to any case.

THE PRESIDENT
FEORS AGUINALDO
YET TEMPORIZES
NEW YORK, Jan. 17. â The Washington correspondent of the Herald telegraphs:
Although insisting that every day brings more reassuring advices from General Otis regard
ing the Philippines, there is no question that the authorities are considerably alarmed on ac
count of the attitude of the insurgents.
General Otis reported to-day that several desertions from Aguinaldo's army have oc
curred, and that the natives are returning to their homes. His dispatch was read at the Cab
inet meeting, and, although it indicated that the situation was still serious, it was determined
to continue the "manana" policy, because the natives are accustomed to it, and it may result
in the extension of American control over the islands without conflict.
In defense of this policy it is contended by administration officials that the hands of the
President are absolutely tied until the treaty of peace is ratified. If he had directed General
Miller to take Iloilo, no matter at what cost, it is asserted that the expedition would have
suffered frightful loss, because the insurgents are numerous and well armed, and are intrench
ed behind the fortifications from which they had vainly tried to drive the Spanish troops.
It is asserted that the administration is doing its utmost to secure the ratification of
the treaty of peace, and when this is accomplished the President will use a firm hand in deal
ing with Aguinaldo and bringing the insurgents to terms.
The statement that Spain proposes to recognize the belligerency of the Filipinos is
considered ridiculous by administration officials, and it is stated that there is no apprehension
of such action being taken, though it is known that Aguinaldo has established a junta in
Madrid, which is using its best efforts to obtain such recognition.

Men Wlio Scored a Triumph
in the Ways of
Peace.
6i)<?clal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â President
McKinley to-day sent a message to
Congress recounting as "another
glorious page In the history of Ameri
can seamen" the valorous deeds of the
officer* and men of the revenue cutter
Bear in rescuing the imperiled whaling
fleet in the Arctic waters last year. The
President tells of the fitting out of the
expedition under Captain Francis Tut
tle of the revenue cutter service, the
dangers and difficulties of the trip and
of the overland expedition by which
First Lieutenant David H. Jarvis,
SfK-ond Lieutenant Ellsworth P. Ber
tholf and Dr. Samuel J. Call carried
reindeer to meet the wants of the whal
ers temporarily. After a graphic re
cital of the perils encountered the mes
sage adds:
The hardships and perils encountered by
members of the overland expedition
In their great journey through an al
most uninhabited region, a barren waste
c and snow, facing death Itself every
day for nearly four months, over a route
never before traveled by white men, with
no r> cugc but at the end of the journey,
ring relief and cheer to seventy-live
distressed citizens of our country, all
m;.ki' a gloi;ous page in the history of
American seamen. They reflect by their
Ie and gallant struggle the highest
credit upon themselves and the Govern
ment which they faithfully served. I
commend the heroic crew to the grateful
consideration of Congress and the Amer
ican people.
. - The year just closed has been fruitful
of nni.i. achievements in the field of war,
and while 1 have commended to your con
j 'ation the names of heroes who have
istre upon the American name In
valorous contests and battles by land and
it is no less my pleasure to invite
your .mention to the victory of peace,
the results of which cannot w : ell be mag
inii' d, and the dauntless courage of the
men engaged stamp them as true heroes,
whose services cannot pass unrecognized.
The Prosidont concludes by asking
the thanks of Congress to the officers
men of the party, with gold medals
â â : honor to those of the overland ex
pedition and $L'f>oo for the bestowal of
rewards to W. T. Lupp and the native
herders who aided the relief expedition.
ALASKAN MAIL SERVICE.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.-The Postofflce
Department to-day made a contract with
the Pacific Steam Whaling Company,
with offices at San Francisco, for mail
tervice along the Southern Alaskan coast
from Sitk.-i to Unalaska, including all In
termediate points. The distance Detween
polnta la IMO miles, and every point
n thnt j-tretch will now have a monthly
Ice during the entire year. The pres
?nt contract is supplementary to existing
service not now applicable to all points,
md is extremely important, in view of the
Ibllity of securing in connection with
t an overland route to the Yukon, wholly
vithin United States territory.
Doubtfulâ Daniel, Harris, Martin,
Roach and Turner.
Several advocates of the peace treaty
have made a personal canvass of the
Senate, and the poll above is the result.
Impatient over the temporizing policy
of the President, and alarmed over the
threatening situation in the Philippines,
Senator "Davis proposes to make the
fight of his life for prompt ratification
of the treaty, and after the Nicaraguan
canal bill is out of the way to-morrow
will insist upon continuous executive
sessions until a vote is reached.
An effort was made to-day by Demo
cratic leaders In the Senate to make a
party question of the peace treaty with
a view to binding members of the mi
nority to vote solidly against ratifica
tion. Five Senators, Gray of Delaware,
Morgan and Pettus of Alabama, Faulk- |
ncr erf West Virginia, and Lindsay of'
Kentucky, openly declared their inten
tion of voting for the ratification of the
treaty in its present form. These Sena
tors did not attend the caucus held in
the President's room on the Senate side
of the Capitol. Senator Clay of Geor
gia also declined to attend, saying he
was opposed to making a party ques
tion of the treaty and preferred to re
main free to vote as his convictions
may dictate when the roll is called.
The caucus, conference or whatever it
| may be called, was organized and con
-1 ducted under the supervision of Sena
tors Gorman of Maryland, Vest of Mis
souri. Jones nf Arkansas, White of Cal
ifornia and Caffery of Louisana.
The caucus committee took possession
of the President's room and Democratic
Senators were invited individually to
EAGAN TO BE TRIED
BY COURT-MARTIAL
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â President McKinley announced to the
Cabinet at its regular meeting to-day that he had determined to court
martial General Eagan. Secretary Alger was not present at the Cabi
net meeting, but Adjutant General Corbin was at the White House in
conference with the President on the subject just prior to the session.
Just prior to the Cabinet meeting General Miles made rather an un
usual call upon two members, Secretaries Hay and Long. He had Just
returned to the city from New York, and when spoken to with refer
ence to the Eagan case adhered to his original declaration that this was
not a time for him to act, if he should act at all, leaving the implica
tion that if the commission did not act or the administration It would
be time for him to take some steps.
The President explained to the Cabinet that he had decided to or
der a courtmartial to try Commissary General Eagan for the abusive
and violent language he had used respecting Major General Nelson A.
Miles while on the witness stand. Ever since the sensational event the
President has been carefully deliberating over the matter and has had
frequent consultations with army officers and others regarding the
steps that should be taken, for he was convinced at the outset that
the question for consideration was what action should be taken and
not whether any disciplinary measures at all should be had. A deter
mination to take some action was vigorously expressed at the last
Cabinet meeting, but the President reserved his final decision.
General Eagan today filed with the commission an amended state
ment omitting all the objectionable statements he had applied to Gen
eral Miles. Eagan will be relieved from duty and probably put under
arrest to-morrow.
SAN JOSE BONDS
LONG OVERDUE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 17.â Now that the
deadlock between Mayor Martin and the
City Council over the selection of a City
Treasurer promises to last some time
the holders of city bonds which be
came due nine days ago are becoming
anxious for their money. Bonds and
Interest amounting to $36,000 were pay
able on January 9. Yesterday the Gar
den City Bank made a demand on
Mayor Martin for the payment of many
thousands of dollars of these bonds.
City Attorney Beasley, when asked for
an opinion as what course could be
pursued in case the deadlock continued
indefinitely, said something must be
done at once. He said that unless a
Treasurer were selected immediately
the holders of delinquent city bonds
would begin suit against the city and
a.Â«k for a receiver to take hold of the
city treasury and carry out the obli
gations of the city. In order to avert
this it was necessary to act at once.
Beasley said the appointment of a re
ceiver would cost from $250 to $2000.
The Council chamber was crowded
this afternoon at the hour set for
Mayor Martin to name a man for
Treasurer. All members of the Coun
cil were present. As soon as the meet
ing was called to order Mayor Martin
again submitted the name of Joseph F.
Colombet. For the fourth time the
Council refused to confirm Colombet.
Noes â Macauley, Miner, Rogers and
Spring. . Ayeâ Wright.
This broke the coldness that had per
vaded the meeting up to this time and
a flow of oratory broke loose from all
quarters. Miner Inquired if the Mayor
were going to continue to present Co
lombet's name day after day. The
question was ignored. Miner said he
and three others had signed a commun
ication stating their objection to Co
lombet and if he changed his position
now "he would be either a fool or a
liar, and he would allow no one to place
him In that position."
Mayor Martin said they could give
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAI^L, Wju jjjn jj:su AX , JANUARY 18, 1899.
"step into the anti-expansion parlor."
There was a constant ingoing and out
coming for more than an hour, and
during that period the Democratic
strength against the treaty was pretty
accurately located. It is said that sev
eral members besides Senator Clay
questioned the wisdom of making a
party question of the treaty. One of
the Democrats who announced his in
tention to vote for the treaty informed
me that the President proposes to call
an extra session of Congress for March
I<"> should the treaty fail of ratification
during this session. Under the cir
cumstances, this Senator argued, it
would be foolhardy for the Democratic
party to put itself on record as delay
ing action on the treaty of peace, which
must be eventually ratified. The friends
of the treaty are more confident than
ever now that they have an assured
strength of two-thirds of the Senate in
favor of the treaty.
THE GERMAN PRESS
WANTS FAIR PLAY
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by Jamea Gor
don Bennett.
BERLIN, Jan. 17.â The Kolnische
Zeitung, commenting upon the dispatch
denying that the Germans are con
spiring to support the Tagallos, says:
"For the first time in the American
press a word has been said in favor of
Germany. Let us hope this is only the
beginning of a policy of fairness."
no reason for voting against Colombet,
who was a competent and fit person to
fill the place of Treasurer.
The question of paying the city bonds
then came up. The Mayor said if the
Council would pass a resolution em
powering the City Clerk, City Attor
ney and himself to pay the bonds he
would take the responsibility of open
ing thp safe and paying the bonds.
Mayor Martin declined to Â«Â£er a con
ference with the Councllmen, as he said
it would be of no purpose.
Council then adjourned till to-mor
row afternoon.
PARNELLITES LOSE
IN IRISH ELECTIONS
DUBLIN, Jan. 17.â Judging from the
results already known at midnight the
Irish elections to-day have been re
markable for the success of the la
borers and the waning power of Par
nellism. The new feature Is that women
were allowed to vote for the first time.
In Dublin the representation of labor
has been quadrupled, while the Parnell
ites have secured little more than half
their former strength, although, owing
to internal dissensions in John Red
mond's party, it is rather difficult to
give an accurate estimate. Mr. Red
mond himself has been elected for one
ward, but he did not head the poll, and
therefore misses the aldermanship.
Timothy Harrington, member of Par
liament for the Harbor Division of
Dublin, is in the same boat, having
been topped by a new laborite.
In Cork the Parnellites have done
better, but they have failed to retain
their former ascendancy, having now
only a majority of one over the Dlllon
ites, while the laborltes have secured
nine members.
However, wherever the Issue was be
tween a Parnellite and an anti-Parnell
ite, and the question was squarely
fought, the Parnellites were victorious.
Speaking generally, there Is an increase
of Nationalist power, but nothing like
a rigorous exclusion of Unionists.
Cuba Now a Paradise.

PARIS, Jan. 17.â The Siecle publishes a

JOURNALIST AND
DIPLOMATIST DEAD
HON. JOHN RUSSELL YOUNG.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â John Russell Young, librarian of the Congres
sional Library, died at his residence here at 5:45 o'clock this morning after
an illness of several weeks.
Ho was born in Downington, Chester County, Pa., November 20, 1841. He
was educated in the public schools of Philadelphia and Now Orleans. He secured
a place on the Philadelphia Press in 1857 as copy boy. When John W* Forney
came to Washington in 1861 to become secretary of the Senate he brought along
Young.
While acting as Forney's private secretary Mr. Young continued his writings
to the Philadelphia Press. By his description of the first battle of Bull Run hÂ«
won his spurs as a graphic war correspondent. He followed the Army of the
Potomac to the end of the Chickahominy campaign. In 1864 he accompanied
General Nathaniel P. Banks on the Red River expedition.
He had contributed to the New York Tribune, and his pleasing style attract
ed the attention of Horace Greeley, with the result that in 1566 Young became
managing editor of the paper. At that time he was only 25 years old.
Young was in Paris during the days of the commune, which he has graphi
cally described, and he accompanied General Grant in his tour of the world.
President Arthur made him Minister to China, and President McKinley named
him in 1597 as Librarian of Congress.

INTERESTS THE PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
War Department Submits Estimates
for River Improvements in
California.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â According to
a report sent to Congress by the War De
partment to-day the proposed improve
ments of the Sacramento River include
the construction of a dam located three
miles east of Stockton, and a canal 150
feet wide at the bottom and 24.850 feet
long thence to the north branch of Cala
vcras River. The estimates include the
cost of dredging, purchase of right of
way, changes of grades of highways and
bridges and dredging in Mormon and
Stockton channels, aggregating $255,016.
Major Heuer recommends that the city
of Stockton should be required to sujp
ply free to the Government the right of
way necessary for the proposed diverting
of the channel. The lower reaches of
Calaveras River are so flat that sedi
ment is there deposited to such an extent
that the Government has expended many
thousands of dollars annually dredging it
out, and had great difficulty finding Btore
age capacity for dredging materiaL. To
divert this silt it Is proposed to construct
the dam and canal and enlarge Cala
veras River. The total cost of the pro
posed Improvements would be a capital
ization of a yearly expenditure of 3 per
cent.
By direction of the Secretary of War, a
board of officers Is appointed to meet at
the call of the president thereof at the
Presidio of San Francisco for examination
of such officers as may be ordered be
fore it to determine their litness for pro
motion. Detail for the board: Lieuten

ONE NEW CASE OF
SMALLPOX REPORTED
James Holgerman Quarantined by
the Los Angeles Health
Department.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 17.â One new
case of smallpox was added to-day to
the cases known to exist. It is that of
James Holgerman, whose brother con
ducts the Red Star grocery, 307 East
Seventh street. The store has been
quarantined. The case is regarded as
a critical one, and the fact that it was
not promptly reported causes much
anxiety in the Health Office. Stringent
measures have been taken by the offi
cials of the Health Department to pre
vent a spread of the disease, which was
first brought to the city by a gang of
Mexican laborers employed on railroad
construction work. Several cases are
in the pesthouse. and others are quar
intined in their houses.
The society queen, Mrs. Dr. Carl
Kurtz, has recovered and been dis
charged from the pesthouse.
The official order issued by the
School Board commanding compulsory
vaccination of children has evoked
much criticism. The full extent of the
opposition to the order requiring all
school children to undergo vaccination
or be excluded from the public schools
after the 23d inst. will be determined
to-morrow night at Music Hall at a
called mass-meeting.

A COALING STATION
ON MISSION ROCK
The President Has Taken Steps to
Turn Over the Property to the
Navy Department.
NEW YORK, Jan. 17.â A 'Washington special to the Herald says:
President McKlnley has overruled the action of California in selling
Mission Rock, in the bay of San Francisco, to a private corporation,
and by executive order has turned the territory over to the Navy De
partment for use as a coaling station. It is understood that the Navy
Department will take steps to condemn the property of the corporation_
and that a recommendation -will then be submitted to Congress for an
appropriation for the construction of coal sheds which will accommodate ;
150,000 tons of coal.
This action of the President is the result of a recommendation made '
by Commander R. B. Bradford, chief of the Bureau of Equipment, j
which was approved by Secretary Long, pointing out the value of Mis- ,
sion Rock, and asking its transfer to the naval service. The Presi- '
dent directed the Secretary of the Navy to look into the title of the cor- 1
poration, and this was found to be defective because the State has no ,
jurisdiction beyond tide water.
The company has improved the rock by the erection of buildings (
and piers and it is expected that it will charge the Government a high
price for the property, especially as it will lose what it paid for the rock. ;
At Commander Bradford's suggestion, the amount of coal to be
stored at Honolulu will be increased to 20,000 tons. At present all coal <
shipped to the Asiatic station is sent from the Atlantic Coast, but as j
soon as the Mission Rock transfer is completed, it is thought that ship
ments will be made from that point. S

BUT POOR COVER
Bakersfield Field Trials
Unsatisfactory.
DOGS ARE IN GOOD FORM
DEBBY CONTESTS NEARING THE
FINISH.
But for the Lack of Suitable Ground
the Contests Would Be Unusu
ally Close and Inter
esting.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 17.â Members
| of the Pacific Coast Field Trials Club and
I their guests took an early start this
morning for the second day's contests
at the Stockdale grounds.
The third brace in the first series of
the derby were set down at the Stock
dale ranch at 8 o'clock. As on Mon
day, birds were very plentiful and
cover exceedingly sparse, making the
trials unsatisfactory. The poor covÂ«r
is attributed to lack of sufficient rains
during the past season. A sufficient
number of birds. for good contests are
found only in the morning because they
take to the dense undergrowth along
the river during the latter part of the
day. The contests to-day were un
eventful. The first series of the derby
was finished, and all but one brace of
the second series run.
The following dogs won In the first
series and were matched for the second
series in the derby: Romeo vs. Vals
mark, Ashbury vs. Merry Heart, Glad
star vs. Veronacal. The latter brace
will be run early to-morrow morning
at Stockdale.
After deciding the Derby stake the
all-aged stakes will be run. The en
trance fee to this stake is $10. The
dogs entered and matched are as fol
lows: Alex C vs. Senator; Fannie G
vs. Countess Glenbeigh; Orion vs.
Sambo, Count Harold vs. Cuba of Ken
wood. This stake is still open to dogs
in the derby. The derby winner will
probably be entered to-morrow morn
ing after the finish.
The club now intends running the all
age stake to-morrow, and the finals on
Thursday, concluding the meet on Fri
day with the Champion stakes. The
remainder of the contests will be run
as rapidly as possible, on account of
the unsatisfactory conditions.
Everything so far has been perfectly
harmonious. George W. Richards and
J. M. Kilgari judge all contests and
give splendid satisfaction. The weather
conditions to-day were perfect and
promise to remain so the entire week.
The dogs are in good form, and every
thing favors close contests except the
cover. __^ -

MASTERS PLUTO
Fight Ends in the Tenth
Round.
KNOCK-OUT BLOW DELIVERED
SOUTH AFRICAN NO MATCH FOR
THE AMERICAN.
From Start to Finish O'Rourke's Pro
tege Has the Foreigner Com
pletely at His
Mercy.
Soeclal DlÃpatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 17.â Again George
Dixon proved his cleverness and hard
hitting ability to-night at the Lenox
Athletic Club, where he met and de
feated young Pluto of South Africa, in
the tenth round of what was to have
been a twenty-round bout. The knock
out came in the shape of a left swing
in the stomach which crushed the wind
out of the latest arrival among the
short haired fraternity in this coun-
try.
Pluto was heralded as a world beater
by his friends, but although he is very
clever in defensive work and undoubt
edly game, he was never dangerous.
Dixon soon battered down the Afri
can's guard and early in the fight dem
onstrated that he was Pluto's master.
As the rounds passed Pluto's strength
was fast ebbing, while Dixon showed
no signs of distress, but on the con
trary seemed to gain renewed energy
and forced his opponent all over the
ring. He rained lefts and rights on
head and body, receiving only an oc
casional blow in return. In the ninth
round he should have knocked his man
out, as the opportunity presented itself
for a right swing on the jaw. Dixon
did not try to take advantage of this
chance, as he plainly saw that Pluto
could not go much further and he was
right in so judging.
Pluto looked weary when he came up
for the tenth round. Dixon sent four
lefts to the face and a right to the
head. Then, with a left on the stom
ach and a right on the jaw, Dixon
floored his opponent. Pluto got up in
side of three seconds, when Dixon be
gan to rush him all over the ring, land
ing lefts and rights at will on the
body. Pluto was unable to guard him
self, and after Dixon had pummeled
him into his corner, Dixon let him out
only to go after him with a finishing
blow, a left swing on the pit of tho
stomach, which put Pluto down an(l
out. Pluto lay on his back for nearly
twenty seconds, and then his seconds
jumped into the ring and carried him to
his corner.
Although Dlxon cannot hit as hard ng
formerly, his wonderful cleverness
still stands by him, and it looks now as
if he would be able to hold his r.wn
against all comers for a long time to
come.

A SEASIDE EXPERIENCE.
Little Quiet Joke on the Family.

Without anything, I bought a

"McKenzie swore that she did. But
even if she did it is nonsense for the
prosecution to suppose that she was a
conscious party to a conspiracy to kill
the man with whom, she is credited
with having been in love. Would it
not be natural for a woman under such
circumstances to endeavor to have the

"The prosecution claims to have In

"If she did the letter will speak for

THE PANAMA CANAL
PEOPLE ARE HEARD
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17.â The new
Panama Canal Company was given a
hearing to-day before the House Com
mittee on Commerce. The hearing was
in accordance with a recent determina
tion of the committee to hear all per
sons concerned in an isthmian canal.
The Panama delegation included Gen
eral Henry L. Abbott, United States
Corps of Engineers, retired; Louis
Choron, chief engineer of the company;
Mr. Bayard, commercial representative,
and Messrs. Cromwell, Curtis and
! Brown, as well as a number of techni
| cal experts of the company. Professor
I Haupt of the Nicaragua Canal Commis
sion was also present.
In the opening statement Mr. Crom
; well summed up the Panama project as
j follows:
As nearly one-half the work of excava
tion is computed the harbors at the ter
mini are nan; rally open and free to entry
by vessels of the largest draught; there
is an existing railroad parallel to the ca
nal an.l vastly expediting the work of
construction; the concessions, titles and
solvency of the company are unquestion
able. Over 3000 men, with a force of 150
engineers, have been for four years and
;ire now actually engaged on the work.
The United States had by treaty with
Colombia entered into special guarantees
respecting a canal across the Isthmus of
Panama, and as all this work has been
done and will be completed without the
cost "f a penny to the United States we
have a right to assume that the Panama
canal iÂ« a necessary, if not the control
ling factor, in the solution of the isthmian
canal problem.
After the details of the scheme had
been set forth, there was sharp cross
examinatiun, developing considerable
acrimony on both sides, during which
the Panama people said De Lesseps'
victims would be paid eventually from
surplus earnings, claimed neither
France nor any American railway was
behind th-- project and denied that they
were seeking to block the Nicaragua
canal project
FOUL PLAY FEARED.
A Santa Bosa Resident Disappears
From His Home.
SAXTA ROSA, Jan. 17.â The friends and
relatives of G. F. Levy of this city are
worried over his mysterious disappear
ance. Since last Saturday he has been
missing from his accustomed haunts and
his wiii fears he has wanuered off in a
fit of mental aberration and met either
â¢ >â :â  foul play.
The missing man has been a resident
of this city over a year. Since his ar
rival here from Seattle he has made his
home at the residence of J. H. Gaddia
on Third sireet. For the past few
months he has been in the employ of Rey
nolds & Proctor, delivering and' handling
a new atlas of Sonoma County. His life
was pleasant and no reason, except that
his mind became suddenly unbalanced,
can be assigned for his sudden disap
pearance. San Francisco police have
been communicated with, but as yet with
out results.
On Saturday morning Levy went for a
Bhort rid*; with his wife. On returning
home he told her he would spend the
night visiting relatives in the country and
asked her to drive out and get him ou
Sunday. When she did so she found he
had not been therf. When last seen on
Saturday afternoon he was stylishly
dressed, ami some of his acquaintances
said he was acting in a peculiar manner.

OF HIS CONTEST
Addresses a Meeting at
Carson.
DUBS STEWART A TRAITOR
DECLARES HIMSELF FINE SENA
TORIAL MATERIAL.
First Test of Strength Will Come
in the Settling of Contests
for Legislative
Seats,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON, Nev., Jan. 17.â The Senatorial
fight in this State had a new feature or
two added to-day. During the mornlnjr
session of the Senate the report of
the Secretary of State waa read
relative to the contested seats. After
some argument it was laid on the table
awaiting the appointment of an election
committee. Both Stewart and it'ewlands
claim power enough to choose this com
mittee. A test of strength will occur
when this affair is finally taken up.
This aftlrnoon the town was flooded
with handbills announcing that â Q.
Newlands would address the citizens and
legislators on his candidacy at the opera
house. The town was illuminated with
bonfires, and a brass band was In attend
ance. Newlands was well received by the
people, and made a lengthy and Impres
sive talk. His explanation for entering
the Senatorial contest against Stewart is
that he proved traitor to Him during the
last campaign. He said he did pledge
himself to Stewart at the Reno conven
tion, but that it was reciprocal, as Stew
art did the same to him. He publicly an
nounced that he was in the fight to stay,
and that the only way Stewart could beat
him was through underhanded methods
and corrupting legislators.
During the course of his speech New
lands failed to announce from which par
ty he would make his fight, but claimed
he was the only material that Nevada
had that was fitted for the Senatorship.
He scored Stewart for his action on the
funding bill, but admitted Stewart's supe
riority over him in regard to the silver
question.
The speech was moderate and was de
livered without bitterness, and has left
a better feeling than was anticipated.
Newlands concluded with the statement
that his candidacy would not be fought
out on a money proposition, but that he
would win in an honorable way or not
at all.
Pennsylvania Deadlock.
HARRISBURG, Pa., Jan. 17.â The end
of the first day's fight in the battle for
I'nit^d States Senator leaves the result
very much in doubt. It is Senator Quay
against the field, and the indications are
that there will be a deadlock lasting some

between Mr. Quay and eight "favorite
j sons," and the Democrats are united on

total strength in both houses -was 112

AUCKLAND, Jan. 17.â When the Oceanic steamship Alameda left
Apia on January 12 a revolution had broken out on the Samoan Islands
and was being waged with much bloodshed and great destruction of prop
erty. The warships Falke and Porpoise, the latter In command of Captain
Sturdee, were then at the islands, and were taking a part in suppressing the
rising.
On December SI the Chief Justice decided in favor of Malletoa Tanu.
claiming Mataafa was barred by the treaty of Berlin. On January 1, 6000
of Mataafa's followers arose in rebellion and defeated 2000 of Malietoa's
men, ambushing them and killing thirteen natives and wounding many. The
rebels have burned 400 houses and razed the towns on Upolu. The bread fruit
trees have been cut down in many places. The foreigners are uninjured.
The crew of the Porpoise is guarding the mission as a refuge for Mall
etoa. The three Consuls have signed a proclamation recognizing the Mat
aafa party provisional government, pending instructions from the powers,
with President Raffell as executive head. On the 6th Raffell, Rose con
curring, proclaimed the Supreme Court closed and took possession, declar
ing himself Chief Justice. He asked Mataafa for 500 men and was refused.
The British and American Consuls united in a strong protest against the
action of the president of the Municipal Council.
On the 7th Captain Sturdee of the Porpoise and the two Consuls de
clared the action illegal. The Porpoise cleared for action and landed a
force of marines. This force was unopposed and took possession of the
court. Chambers was reinstated and the British and American flags hoisted
over Chambers' house and the courthouse. The Provisional Government
wrote to Sturdee on the 12th that it would seize Malietoa Tanu and take
Tamasese off the Porpoise by force if necessary, deprive them of their titles
and desert them. Chambers is residing on the Porpoise. The Falke is in
active.
The British and American Consuls have protested against any Infringe
ment of the Berlin treaty. British residents have taken refuge in their Con
sulate and the American residents have taken refuge in the mission.
An American warship is urgently needed here.
SAYS SHE
WILL DIE
IN A CELL
Old Mrs. Dickinson Is on the
Verge of Complete
Collapse.
SUISUN, Jan. 17.â The preliminary
examination of W. Q. Miller, Mrs.
Elizabeth G. Dickinson and Mrs. Addie
Wilson, charged with the murder of old
Dan Wilson on October 9, 1896, will be
held next Tuesday. The three prison
ers were brought before Justice of the
Peace Hitchcock of Fairfleld Township
this afternoon and the date formally
fixed. The proceedings were brief and
were held in the Sheriff's office at the
Courthouse for the sake of convenience,
the prisoners being brought over from
the jail, one by one.
MrÃ. Dickinson was the first to ap
pear. Her confinement has left its
mark on her face and her nerves are
completely unstrung. When informed
she must spend another week in jail
before she could have a hearing she
lifted her voice in feeble and ineffectual
protest.
"If I don't have a hearing before
Tuesday I will be in a sick bed," she
declared.
Attorney George Lamont, who ap
peared for her, quieted the old woman
by the assurance that her interests
would not be inujred by the delay,
which, he said, was unavoidable.
While being taken back to her cell
Mrs. Dickinson asked Under Sheriff
Robinson:
"What will they do with me if I am
not held at the preliminary examina
tion?"
"You will be discharged and allowed
to to home," replied the officer. "If
the evidence against you is considered
strong enough you will be held for
trial."
"How long will it be until the trial?"
she asked.
"About two months," replied Robin
son.
"They will never try me," asserted
the accused woman, her lips quivering
and tears coming to her eyes. "I shall
be dead by that time."
Whether she meant that she would
succumb to the strain entailed by
worry and confinement or would put
an end to the suspense by committing
suicide, the officer was unable to deter
mine.
At the request of Mrs. Dickinson At
torney Lamont also appeared for Mrs.
Wilson. The murdered man's ex-wife
had very little to say while in court,
but while preparing to face the ordeal
she raid to the Deputy Sheriff sent to
escort her to the Courthouse:
"I will be awful glad when this is all
over. I dread to have it come, but,"
she added hastily, "not that I have
anything to fear."
Miller as usual was loquacious and
confident. He objected to the delay of
another week, but his objections were
not listened to. L. M. Robbins, his at
torney, informed him that an earlier
date could not be fixed. While sitting
in the Shei-iff's office Miller caught
sight of ex-Constable Kintock, who has
been one of the most active in gather
Too Poor to Provide Nursing.
TOMALES, Jan. 17.â M. Ancini, one of
the unfortunate victims of trichinosis,
caused by eatingr pork infected with tri
chinae, is lying very low, and his death
is believed to be a matter of a few days.
Aa Ancini Is very poor he haa had "no
ing evidence to connect him with the
Wilson murder and proceeded to inter
rogate him in reference to the case.
Miller asked Kintock if he had not seen
him (Miller) at the ranch with his wife
on the Sunday following the assassina
tion. Kintock had no such recollection,
but he did remember that several wit
nesses saw Miller and Hez McEwen
on the Wilson ranch on the Sunday be
fore the murder, presumably looking
over the ground to familiarize them
selves with the layout. Miller has all
along denied that he was on the Wilson
ranch or at McEwen's on the Sunday
previous to the fatal Friday, and his
interrogation of Kintock was probably
for the purpose of showing that the
former officer was mistaken in his
dates. Miller persists in his declaration
that he never hired a buggy in Vallejo
to go to the ranch but once, and that
was the Sunday after old Dan was
killed. This in face of the positive
statements of Riley and Craig, who say
he hired a buggy on the evening of
Friday, October 9, and returned the rig
early Saturday morning.
As the Under Sheriff was leaving the
jail after returning Miller to his cell,
Mrs. Dickinson called to him and asked
with more interest than she has shown
at any time since her incarceration:
"Is there anything new against
'Bill?' "
Robinson declined to enlighten her
as to the amount or character of the
evidence against her son and alleged
accomplice.
Mrs. Lillie Bailard, daughter of Mrs.
Wilson, visited the office of District At
torney Devlin late this afternoon, ac
companied by her husband. She was
subjected to a thorough examination
concerning events coming under her
notice at the McEwen ranch on the
night her father was shot down. She
affirmed all she had previously told,
and while she does not accuse her
mother of any knowledge of or connec
tion with the crime, she said she was
ready to take nothing back and would
tell all she knew willingly and freely.
She repeated the story of her mother
entering the house immediately after
the fatal shot was fired and going to
bed without disrobing. In this she is
contradicted by Mrs. Wilson, who
stoutly affirms that she never in her
life went to bed with her clothes on
and that on the night in question, she
distinctly recollects, she was attired
in only her nightgown when awakened
by the barking of the dogs aroused by
the men who brought the first' news
of the murder to the ranch at about
11 o'clock.
Mrs. Bailard heard the assassin's
shot plainly, although she was inside
the cabin at the time, but her mother,
although she was out of doors and in
a better position to hear, maintains
that she heard no shot fired.
Subpenaes for the witnesses were
sent out by the Sheriff's office this
afternoon in all cases in which the ad
dresses of the persons wanted are
known. Some of the witnesses have
not yet been located, but the authori
ties are endeavoring to find them and
expect to have them located in time
to bring them to court for the hearing.
nursing and little medical attention. Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac was notified of
the man's condition to-day and immedi
ately laid the matter before Supervisdr
Mason, who represents tfiis district. It
is expected the proper authorities will, at
least, make provision for the proper care
of Ancini, whether he recovers or not.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 17.â The changes In "fctock
Quotations for the day were unimportant. The
market showed strength most of the day, and
repeated efforts on the part of the bears to de
j rest I'rioes, although assisted by sales of some
60,000 shares of stocks for London account, were
of little avail, and prices worked upward gen
erally until the last hour, when previous gains
pt XV.c clay were practically wiped out. The
highest prrces of the day were made about
noon, the standard shares showing handsome
gain?. Although there had been such a large
volume of sales for London, internationals at
this time were above last night's close. At the
opening the market was under pressure, but
variations were fractional. Commission houses
had many selling orders, but after a few mm- ;
utes the demand more than equaled the sup- >
ply. Traders Bold early, then bought, and In
the final dealings reversed their position by
again belling. Several of the largest houses
â were openly large buyers in the second hour.
When prices eased oft in the late dealings com
mission-house business diminished. New York
Airbrake to-day took a violent plunge of some
IS% points, of which it recovered only 3%. The I
Selling was on a report that the Westlnghouse i
suit had been compromise. The volume of i
trading was about one-quarter below the mil- 1
lion share mark, which had been so common j
of late. The closing was weak. There was |
much favorable comment upon the Govern
ment's foreign trade system, showing an ex
cess of December exports over imports of $83,- <
426,000. and for the year of $421,261,000.
The bond market displayed more animation '
to-day. Total sales, $6,725,000. United States
fives coupon advanced '* in the bid price.

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK. Jan. 17.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: In
the markets here to-day there was less busi
ness and less enthusiasm than of late. Amer
icans hesitated early on free profit-taking,
awaiting New York- prices. Exceptions were
Central Pacific and Pennsylvania. New York
supported the market for half an hour, but
at the close of the session prices dwindled
and the finish was only fractionally above the
worst.
The strength of Central Pacific was due to
an erroneous rumor of a scheme of settlement
arranged and on the eve of publication.
As a matter of fact all the London com
mittee knows is the Government's terms.
Coppers were again firm. It is expected that
the London bank rate will soon be reduced.
Yesterday's African gold is in refiner's hands,
but Is promised for the bank.

CHICAGO MARKET.
j CHICAGO, Jan. 17.â The foundation upon
which yesterday's firmness was built gave way
in the spot where it had seemed most secure
, and Wheat started very weak. It was dis
i covered last night after the close that Russia
i Instead of having shipped only 240,000 bushels
xif Wheat last week, as reported, had Bent out
1,024,000 bushels. There was a heavy snow
storm prevailing here and about the same
conditions were reported to exist In the winter
Wheat sections, where the fields have been
bare from the recent thaw. The sentiment
among traders was very bearish. May opened
%c lower, at 70%@70*ic, but subsequently sold
very sparingly at 70% con buying against
"put" privileges. There was no special feature
; in the early trading to encourage any ex
tensive buying, and as outside traders wer^
! scarce the market ruled dull and heavy and
May slipped off to 70% c. The market ruled
heavy throughout the session and May sagged
to 70% c, where some buying for the long, ac
count caused a feeble rally to 70% c, but as
Boon as thin buying subsided May weakened
apaln to 70% c. where It closed.
Lower cables and large receipts weakened
Corn. The decline in Wheat served to dis
courage longs and there was a good deal of
liquidation by prominent holders. May left o?.
lower.
Oats met with rather Influential soiling by
brokers and this together with the decline in
the other grains carried prices off. May clxied
%@\io lower.
Lower prices for hogs at the yards and the
grain weakness depressed provisions at the
start. Commission â  houses sold freely and
prices declined rapidly until heavy buying of
ribs steadied the. market and a Blight reaction
set In. ' Pork closed 2%c decline and lard and
ribs 6c each. â¢

Taxes on Hearths and Windows.
Among the most curious of the taxes
which have from time to time been
imposed are those upon chimneys and
upon windows. The former tax was first
enforced In 1662, and was at the rate of 2
shillings upon every hearth or chimney.
This was an obnoxious tax, and William
111 immediately on his accession to the
throne obtained some popularity by send
ing a message to Parliament desiring 1 that
the imposition should he taken off (March
1, 1659), and his Majesty's faithful Com
mons complied with their sovereign's re
quest. The window tax, of which our
fathers and grandfathers still talk, was
not repealed until 1851.â The Cornhill.

.When, after capturing the second event

fied for a foul there was no end of kick-
Ing among a considerable number of race-
The race in particular was a
sev*n furlong run, decided under selling
conditions, for which Red Glenn ruled a
BtrotLg: choice. The latter ran as if stale, \
fur ha was never in it. Pat Morrissey,
Cyril and the three-year-old Horton had !
the race to themselves, and as the stretch
was reached were heads apart. On they
faced to the wire, Pat Morrissey on the;
Inside. Horton on the outside, Cyril sand
wiched between them. Nearly opposite j
ih-e . paddock some unavoidable crowding
took place, and Martin on Cyril was com
pelled to take his mount back. Then, in j
a fierce drive, Turner landed Horton first, !
a head before Morrissey, astride which !
TlioTpe rode a desperate finish. Thorpe
claimed a foul, and after mature deliber
ation., .the judges placed Horton last, the
purse going to Pat Morfissey.
The racing throughout was the best wiN

The disqualification of Horton made a

TWO OVERDUE
COLLIERS REACH
PORT IN SAFETY
Czarina Had a Hard
Time of It.
STRIKE ON THE NIPPON MARU
WHITE ENGINEERS HAVE A ROW
WITH THE JAPS.
Harbor Commissioners Object to
Spring Valley Charges â Trouble
Over the Burying of a
Sailor.
The steam colliers Czarina and Welling
ton reached rort yesterday after a most
tempestuous passage from Puget Sound.
During nineteen hours of such weather as
Captain Collins says he has never seen
the equal of on this coast, the Czarina
made eighteen miles. Saturday night it
blew a hurricane and everything mov
able on the decks was washed away.
The chocks under the boats were washed
out and nothing was left to hold them
but the lashings. The waves that came
over the steamer broke in the coverings
of the boats and they were still filled with
water as the Czarina steamed up the
bay.
The side lights were washed away and
Saturday night when the waves were
breaking clean over the bridge the head
light could not be hoisted and a man had
to be stationed on the bridge ready to fire
off torches in case of an emergency. Be
tween Coos Bay and Yaquina Bay a large
quantity of new lumber was passed
through. Some of it was deck and some
rough timbers and Captain Collins is of
the opinion that it was some deckload
that was washed away during the storm.
The Wellington had a similar experience
to the Czarina and the other colliers as
they come in are sure to have tales of woe
to tell.
i There is trouble in the engine room of
I the Japanese steamer Nippon Marti. The
white engineers say the Japanese en
gineers are an ignorant set, not knowing
| the first rudiments of marine engineering,
, and until efficient assistants are given
: them they will refuse duty. On the Nip
â¢ pon Maru there are four white engineers.
â¢ Chief Whitburn, Second Gledden, Third
; Johnstone artd Fourth Howsagoe. The
I Japanese are headed by Chief Engineer
Ougi. He knows a little about his. busi
; ness, according to the white engineers,
but the others are useless.
"They cannot even act as oilers," said
i Third Assistant Johnstone yesterday.
J "All the work is thrown on our shoulu
i ers and we simply refused to do it. Yes
j terday Howsagoe and I quit. Gledden is
! sick in St. Mary's Hospital and none of
j us will go back unless we are given
| proper assistants. We stood it during the
j trip out from England because we were to
gel t-xtra help on our arrival in Japan,
i but the help never came and now we have
i struck. That's all there is to the matter."
If the Nippon Marti people seek to sup
ply the place of the striking engineers
' from the ranks of the local engineers they
, will be confronted with the same dlfn
j culty, as an American engineer will most
i certainly refuse to work under conditions
j which have caused an Englishman to
kick over the traces.
The Harbor Commissioners met yester
day, and discussed the payment of the
Spring Valley Water Company's bill for
water supplied the State on the front.
President Colnon thought the charge was
excessive, and said a flat rate should be
established, more 'particularly as the
water .company was using the State's
wharves for the carrying of mains. The
water company's representative said the
commission could make no plea on ac
count of the mains being on the wharves,
because they had a right to lay them on a
public highway. "Not on the State
wharves," broke in ex-Governor Budd,
who was present for the first time in the
capacity of the board's attorney. "You
Ot lay those mains on State property
without a permit." It was finally decided
to allow the matter to go over, and in the
meantime the board's attorney and the
water company's legal advisers will hold
a conference.
Bids for the erection of a shed for
Wftlls, Fargo & Co.. between piers 3 and
4. were ordered called for. At the next
meeting of the board the chances are that
the name of A. Page Brown as architect
of the new ferry depot will be ordered
added to the foundation-stone.
Th<- steamer City of Peking, which left

master, proceeded to bury him and ad

the police had to be called in before Go

MRS. REGAN IN COURT.
The Hearing Continued for a Week
and Bail Refused for Her
Appearance.
Mrs. Elizabeth Regan appeared in Judge
Graham's court yesterday morning- for
her preliminary examination on the
charge of murdering mounted --ollceman
Thomas H. Kennedy at her father's
house, 232 Chenery street. Attorney Long
represented her, and Attorney . arrett
was present to assist Prosecuting Attor
ney Wentworth. Barrett has been en
gaged by Kennedy's relatives to look af
ter their interests.
The courtroom was crowded with peo
ple anxious to get a look at the defend
ant's face, but she thwarted their pur
pose by being heavily veiled in black.
Three of her sisters sat beside her.
When the case was called Attorney
Long answered that he was ready to pro
ceed, but the prosecution asked for a con
tinuance for a week so as to make prepa
rations for the examination. The Judge
granted the continuance. Then Long
made a strong plea for bail for the de

GUILTY YET ACQUITTED.
Smuggler Mallaby Succeeded in Hyp
notizing the Federal Grand
Jury.
To the great surprise of the United
States Attorney and all others conversant
with the facts, the Federal Grand Jury
yesterday unanimously ignored the charge
of smuggling made against Dr. Z. T. Mal
laby, a military surgeon, who arrived
from Manila on the Government transport
Senator last Saturday.
Mallaby was guilty, and confessed his
guilt. lie wns caught in the act, and
when searched on the wharf about forty
yards of ellk cloth was found wrapped
around hia body underneath his clothing.
He said that he had bought the silk as
a present for his wife, and that was too
poor to pay the duty on the silk.
Ex-Assistant United States Attorney
Bert Schlesinger appeared for wallaby,
and insisted on the prisoner's constitu
tional right to appear before the Grand
Jury. Mallahy was granted an audience,
told his Btory confessing his guilt, and
urged that as he had, constructively at
least, fought for his country, it would
be no more than right to let him go. Ttiey
thought so. too. ignored the bill and Mal
laby and his lawyer walked away, the
former with his tongue in his cheek and
the latter with a wink.
HIS OWN LAWYER.
Joe Castro's Original Way of Collect

Joe Castro is a son of Sunny Italy, 25
years old. and his knowledge of the En
glish language is equal to his knowledge
of the law. This is why Prison-Keeper
Callinan at the California street station
did not understand what Castro said to
him yesterday through the bars concern
ing the cause of his arrest.
Castro was employed by a fish vender
named Ernest â¢ Vannucchi in the Grand
Central Market. He alleged that Van
nucchl owed him $11 95 balance of his
monthly wages. Castro closed the stall
last Monday night and removed the cash
register to the fish stall of a creditor of
his employer. Vannucchi finding his reg
ister and Castro missing yesterday morn

street police station charging Castro
with grand larceny.

Damaging Facts Told by the Man
Who Notified the Chinese
Bureau.
The special agents' investigating com
mission did a big day's work yesterday,
having examined about half a dozen wit
nesses in the matter of the corrupt prac
tices alleged against the management of
the Chinese Bureau. Interpreter Ricketts,
called "Doc" by those who love him, was
asked as to the routine duties of the
bureau and the manner of conducting the
examinations of Chinese immigrants on
board the steamers at the Mail dock. His
testimony did not reveal anything new.
Arthur H. Lotto, a newspaper reporter,
was the most important witness of the
day. His testimony threw light upon the
shifty and evasive methods of Meredith
and his supporters, and brought out the
fact that Meredith had allowed the
Chinese procuress, Fong Suey Wan, to
escape with his eyes open and with the
knowledge that her friends were plan
ning for her escape. He told how he had
called Meredith's attention to the neces
sity for making a complaint against the
woman for the crime of importing female
slaves into this country, since Fong Suey
was being held only because she had not
produced her papers at the time of the
raid and therefore would be released by
Commissioner Heacock as soon as her
lawyers should produce her papers in
court, which they were then preparing to
do. He said that in reply to his warning
Meredith winked one eye very cunningly
and said, "We are getting up a great cose
against her."
On the next day the â woman was taken
by her attorney, who is a daily companion
of Meredith in the bureau, before United
States Commissioner Heacock, and her
papers were produced In support of the
motion to discharge her from the only
charge made or pending, namely being
unlawfully in the United States. She
was accordingly at half-past 9 o'clock in
the morning discharged so far as lay in
the power of the Commissioner, that is,
he agreed to report to United States Dis
trict Judge de Haven in favor of her re
lease. The woman was then taken to the
rooms of the United States Marshal on
the floor below the office of the Chinese
Bureau and kept there in the prisoners'
room in full view of all visitors until 2
o'clock in the afternoon, when she was
taken before Judge de Haven and dis
charged.
The witness testified further that he
had been "informed by members of the
press that Collector J.ackson had in
formed them that Meredith had denied
to the Collector that he had been so
warned by Lotto." The witness there
upon called on Meredith and wanted to
know what- he meant by making him
(Lotto) a liar. Meredith denied the story
of his denial to the Collector, and offered
to go with the witness to the Collector
and straighten the matter. When the
witness informed Collector Jackson of
what Meredith had said, the Collector
declined to discuss the subject.
Lotto also testified to offensive lau
guage used by Meredith toward a re
porter of The Call because he had over
heard the reporter asking Assistant
United States Attorney Sehlesinger
whether Meredith had informed him that
he (Meredith) or anyone else had in
tended to place an additional charge
against Fong Suey Wan to hold her. He
added that a fight between the reporter
and the bureau chief was averted by the
interference of Jack Sherrard. chief "clerk
of the District Attorney. Mr. Sherrard
catching hold of Meredith and hustling
him into the corridor.
Mrs. Sallie C. Pickens, who filed serious
charges against Major Moore, will be ex
amined to-day.

WAS WILLING TO
ADD MURDER
TO HIS THEFT
Moriarty's Narrow
Escape.
STRUCK AT IN THE DARK
DESPERATE STRUGGLE FOR POS
SESSION OF A KNIFE.
The Officer Succeeds in Placing the
Handcuffs on His Antagonist
and Then Finds His
Coat Cut.
An agile movement of Policeman John
J. Moriarty saved him from occupying a
slab In the Morgue early yesterday morn
ing. He dodged a bread knife with a keen
blade nearly twelve inches long.
Between 2 and 3 o'clock Policeman W.
J. Smith noticed that the glass panels of
the door of William Eyb's saloon, 233 A
Stevenson street, were broken. He
crawled through the window, and found
that the place had been ransacked by a
burglar. The money drawer had been
broken open and was empty, and the
bread knife and four bottles of whisky
had been stolen.
A boy from the Spreckels Market told
Smith that a man had come out of the
saloon a few minutes before and had
turned down Fourth street. Just then the
sergeant's whistle sounded, and Smith
went to meet him on Fourth street. After
the sergeant left Smith saw a man come
out of Donovan & Hourihan's saloon,
Fourth and Jessie streets, which had been
closed shortly after midnight, and he
concluded he was the burglar. Smith
went after him and the man commenced
to run.
Policeman Moriarty was coming down
Market street at the time, and seeing the
man running he suspected something was
wrong. As the man approached he or
dered him to stop. Instead of doing so,
the man made a rush at Moriarty and
slashed at him with the bread knife. Mor
iarty saw the knife in time to spring
aside, and the knife missed his body but
cut a hole in his coat. Before the would
be murderer could recover himself Mori
arty struck him a blow on the neck that
knocked him down. Moriarty sprang
upon him, and a terrific struggle ensued
for the possession of the knife. Moriarty
succeeded in drawing his club, and a blow
or two on the head made him master of
the situation. He had just got the hand
cuffs on the man when Smith arrived.
At the City Prison the man gave the
name of James Phillips, a molder, living
at 248 Tehama street. He is a big, strap
ping young fellow, much taller and heav
ier than the plucky policeman. When
searched 30 cents and a plugged quarter
were found on him and the quarter
was later identified by Eybs as having
been taken from the money drawer. The
bread knife was also booked as evidence
against him. The officers found that he
had also broken into Donovan & Houri
han's saloon, and two charges of bur
glary were booked against him. He is
also suspected of breaking into King's
store, 15 Fourth street, and stealing $4 or
$5 from the till. It was entered during
the early hours of the morning. Phillips
is unknown to the police.
TO BELIEVE DR. STEBBINS.
Bey. S. W. Brook, a Celebrated Bos
ton Divine, to Take the First
Unitarian Pulpit.
Rev. Stopford W. Brook of Boston,
where for a number of years he has been
the minister of the First Unitarian
Church, will occupy the pulpit of Dr. Steb
bins for probably six months. Dr. Brook
is the son of a distinguished English
clergyman of the same name, who was
long chaplain to the Queen, and is a very
scholarly divine. He has telegraphed his
acceptance of the offer, and will leave
Boston on the 30th inst., arriving in this
city in time to preach at the First Unita
rian Church the first Sunday in February.
Dr. Horatio Stebbins, after long years
of arduous and faithful work in the min
istry, finds it necessary to take a season
ot rest. He is still in good health, wich
mental faculties as clear as when . the
Starr King church first heard the voice
of its eloquent minister, but he feels that
a vacation from the pulpit is due him. in
Dr. Brook the people of the First Unita
rian Church will find a worthy successor
to their old and popular pastor.

PROTECTION AGAINST FIBE.
Sunnyside Is an Applicant for the
Preservation of Its Homes.
The frequent loss of homes and the per
sonal property of some of the residents
of Sunnyside within the past six months
has prompted the owners of property in
that section to ask the Supervisors for
the location of an engine and hose cart
in that district.
Within the past six months no less than
eight houses have been burned to tne
ground with an their contents. If there
had been an engine within call of tne
place no such damage would have oc
curred.
The loss of the property, together with
the high rate of premium asked by the in
surance companies for the taking of a risk
in any portion of the Sunnyside district,
has prompted the owners of real estate
to ask the Supervisors to provide tnat
place with an engine and hose cart.
He Shot at the Nurse.
Edward Forrest, an employe of the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company, re
siding at 224 Sagamore street. Ocean View,
took two shots at Mrs. Bridget Holbrook
at 1 o'clock yesterday morning. Forrest,
who had been indulging in strong arink,
returned to his home in an ugly mood
and commenced to abuse his stepchildren.
The woman, who was nursing his sick
wife, remonstrated, and Forrest picked up
his pistol and fired two shots at her,
neither of which took effect. Officers Dorn
and Herve, on hearing the shots, placed )
Forrest under arrest and booked him on
the charge of assault to commit mur- !
der.

HELMONT'S
VIOLIN RECITAL
Gerome Hehnont, a well grown lad of
perhaps 13 or 14, appeared in short trous
ers at the Sherman & Clay Hall last night
and played the violin. Master Helmont
Is a pupil and protege of Musin's. and his
bowing and general manipulation of the
instrument recalled that artist. The
youngster draws a strong, firm tone, se
cure and easy; his execution is quite ad
mirahle for one of his years, but his im
agination seems to find but little outlet
In his performances, which are not
ably mechanical. He was assisted last
night by Miss Grace Preston, a Sturdy
pianist, and Miss Ida Simmons, a contral
to of good tone within a limited range.
Other concerts will be given to-day and
Saturday afternoon in the same hall.

RENEWAL OF
ACTIVITY IN
CITY POLITICS
Was There a Slate in
the Convention?
REPUBLICANS APPREHENSIVE
CITIZENS' CONVENTION MAY
NOMINATE KELLER.
Prospect of Some of the Retiring
Candidates Being Anxious
to Serve Another
Term.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 17.
Now that the Republican committee
has held its convention and has nomina
ted practically the same ticket as the
Municipal League there is renewed ac
tivity In the movement to hold a citizens'
convention. At the Republican conven
tion last oight an attempt had been made
to bring ti.c veterans Into line by ap
pointing Colonel G.W. Hoguet, commander
of the Army ;uid Navy League, a dele
pate, but as Colonel Hogurt had already
gone on record as favoring primaries he
declined to serve.
There are many Republicans who con
sider that they are entitled to recognition
from the â  arty who declined to go before
the Republican convention on the ground
thai everything was slated, and that the
appointment of delegates by the com
mittee was the same in principle as the
appointment of candidates.
This Idea was partly borne out by the
rapidity with which nominations were
rushed through, there being but one can
didate for each of the city offices. This
has brought out the old cry of "slate,"
and ii is emphasized by the fact that the
Municipal League and the Republican City
Central Committee should produce prac
tically the same ticket.
Th- Citizens' convention, or whatever
it may bo called, will undoubtedly pro
duce, some lively campaigning. Its nom
inee for Mayor will probably be M. J.
Keller, whose friends have been making
a quiet campaign for several weeks. It
was expected that Mr. Keller's name
would have been presented to the conven
tion last night, but it was very evident
that Mr. Snow was the nominee of the
convention, and beyond mentioning Mr.
Snow's name* no one even attempting to
make a speech in his behalf.
It is not to be supposed that many of
the retiring Councilmen will desire another
term. Major Woodward has already an
nounced his candidacy and has obtained
the support of the Lakeside Improvement
Clubâ an aggregation of wealthy men who
have bpen successful in persuading the
city to purify I^ake Merritt.
Councilman Will B. Prlngle Is not a
candidate for re-election. He could have
received the nomination from the Munici
pal League and Republicans had he de
sired. But the appointment of his father
to a Supreme Court Commissionership
will largely increase the legal work of
the Councilman and so he withdrew from
both tickets.
"Puggy" Smith, Footpad.
OAK I. AM. Jan. 17.â The police to-night
successfully landed James Smith, better
known as ".fuggy" Smith, in the City
Prison on a charge of robbery, and they
believe they have captured one of the
men resnonslble for several recent "hold
ups." Smith was caught in the act of a
most daring robbery. His victim was
Daniel Schmidt, a dairyman, residing at
Park and Frultvale avenues.
"Puggy" Smith has been hanging about
the Keystone saloon at the southeast cor
ner of Ninth and Franklin streets, only
half a block from the Chinese quarter, in
â¢which Ah Fook was beaten and robbed of
jsrio a few weeks ago. There he met the
dairyman shortly before 9 o'clock to
night, and while the latter was taking a
drink "Fuggy" attempted to reach his in
tended victim's pocket. Schmidt, how
ever, balked the effort and got out of the
place.
"Puggy" followed him and attacked him
at the dark corner just opposite. He
felled his man to the sidewalk and was
in the act of searching for money, when
Schmidt's calls for help brought Office*
Thomas Cooney to the scene In time to
THE PESTILENTIAL POND.
Fair Estate Will Carry Sewers to the
Bay and Abate the Nuisance.
THE pond now existing in the territory bounded by Webster, Devisadero, Bay and Lewis streets, into
which the Fillmore and Pierce streets sewers empty, is fast becoming a serious menace to public health.
The city authorities have recognized the danger of the situation and will take steps to abate the nuisance.
Whilo the pestilential odors have to some extent been purified by the late rains, it is only a question
of a short time when the rains will cease and the inclosed body of water on the northern bay frontage will
breed disease and death.
Manager ''harles Neil of the Fair estate when seen yesterday would not admit that the pond was as black
as it was painted. "The odors that arise in_ that section," sai<! he, "are due mainly to the refuse matter from
the gas, poap and ammonia works. In regard to the sewers which empty therein plans have been already drawn
by our chief engineer, James L. Drum, to carry them to the bay on piles. This matter has been under his direct
attention and will be carried out in the course of three or four months. Mr. Fair during his life time agreed to
construct the sewera and this was intended to be done ever since the gap in the wall was closed up. The engi
neers state that tho pond, which is fourteen feet in depth in pome places, rises and falls with the tide, and yester
day it was lowered an inch. We have spent nearly a million dollars in those improvements and it is our intention
to make the land productive at the*"earliest possible date. We have the interests of the city at heart and we are not
desirous of maintaining anything which will be inimical to those interests or to the public health."
The hpalth officials have taken eteps to have the nuisance abated, but without much hope of immediate suc
cess. On Friday Health Officer Gallwey sent formal notice to Mr. Neil, representing the Fair estate, to the effect
that something must be done in the matter, aftd ' afterward accompanied Mr. Neil and an engineer to the scene
where the best methods of remedying the nuisance were discussed. It was agreed that an outlet to tidewater must
â be made, but no especial alacrity to make the necessary reconstruction of Bewers was evinced by Mr. NeiL
effect the robber's arrest. "Puggy" sur
rendered without a struggle and it the
City Prison was charged with robbery.
Schmidt had considerable money on his
person.
The prisoner has served time at San
Quentin for burglary, but was released
several years ago. He has been suspected
of several jobs since then, but nothing
could be proved. He is a powerful fel
low, aged 33 years and the police think
they have conclusive evidence to con
vict.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUAKX 18, 1899.
MORE DEPUTIES
MAY HAVE TO
BE APPOINTED
County Covernment
Act Responsible.
A CAUCUS OP THE DELEGATES
SEVERAL OFFICES MAY BE
GIVEN MOitE HELP.
Many of the Incumbents Already
Propose Lobbying to
Effect Their Pur
pose.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 17.
Next Monday evening the question of
augmenting the cost of the county gov
ernment will be considered by the Alame
da legislative delegation in the Capitol
building.
Last night the delegation held a cau
cus and decided to send a notice to the
Alameda County officials and all who may
be Interested in the matter to attend a
meeting in room 14 of the Capitol build
ing next Monday evening. The legislators
have set aside this time so as to hear ar
guments for and against the employment
of more deputies.
Much comment is now being made upon
the fact that all the county officials who
took office a couple of weeks ago were
elected with the full knowledge that the
new county government act went into
force on January 1 of this year. Only two
years ago the Alameda County officials
went to Sacramento and were largely in
strumental in the framing of the new act.
Now it Is declared that its operation will
work a hardship on several of the de
partments and that more help Is required.
While there Is no doubt that the gen
eral spirit of the legislators Is in accord
ance with the practice, of economy, it is
probable that some of the departments
may be granted an extra deputy, al
though there is hardly an official who will
not strive to add to the cost of his de
partment.
The County Auditor's office it Is con
ceded needs one more deputy than is
given to it under the act. This Is proved
by the fact that ex-Auditor Whidden al
ways attended personally to the duties of
his office and found it necessary to have
two or three deputies, which he had to
pay out of his appropriation. It is a
pretty good argument that no official
would employ more help than Is absolute
ly necessary when he could keep for him
self all of his appropriation that he was
not forced to pay out. The new act al
lows the Auditor but two deputies, and
another is necessary.
Another office which is not dealt fairly
with by the act is the Treasurer's office.
Treasurers have always paid two depu
ties while at the same time doing a full
man's work themselves. The new act al
lows but one deputy to the County Treas
urer and this is not enough. Outside of
these two exceptions there appears to be
no reason why any other changes should
be made in the county government act in
regard to counties of this class.
Already may of the county officials
have gone to Sacramento to commence
their work.
Must Answer for Bobbery. '
OAKLAND, Jan. 17.â Justice of the
Peace Quinn of Pleasanton to-day held
Watt Ward to answer before the Superior
Court on a charge of robbery, fixing his
bail at $4m Ward is charged with hav
ing held up a saloon-keeper named De
rascus at Pleasanton last Saturday, com
pelling him to deliver up $5. Ward was
returned to the County Jail to-night.
A Consolidation Bill.
OAKLAND, Jan. 17.â The merchants
will hold a meeting to-morrow morning
to consider the steps to be taken toward
framing a bill that will permit of the
Incorporation of the city and county of
Oakland. The Alameda legislative dele
gation has asked that such a bill be sent
to Sacramento, as they cannot draw it
themselves.
Lake MÂ«rritt Dredging.
. OAKLAND, Jan. 17.â The dredging: of
Lake Merritt has been commenced. The
first work done was on the east side of
the lake, where a shallow was deepened
in order to permit the mooring of a barge
to a temporary wharf. The mud pumped
out went to fill in the land which the late
Henry D. Bacon has deeded to the city.
The dredger has a capacity of about 5000
yards each twenty-four hours.
McCOMB'S SAD CASE.
An Author! .y on Penology Again to
Be Committed to an Asylum.
OAKLAND, Jan. 17.â George John Mc-
Comb, son of the late General McComb,
ex-Warden of Folsom Prison, was ex
amined for insanity to-day and will again
be committed to an asylum.
About seven years ago and again in
1895 McComb was treated at Agnews for
mental infirmity. Last night he became
very violent, as he appeared in the streets
of Temescal half dressed. At the Receiv
ing Hospital It became necessary to strap
him down until he could barely move.
This morning, however, his frenzy sub
sided and he appeared quiet, answering
all questions intelligently.
McComb, who is now 3S years of age,
served as deputy under his father at Fol
som. He wrote a treatise on penology, of
which he made a deep study, and his
close applicotion In that direction is sup
posed to be responsible for his present
mental infirmity.
Race Horses Mortgaged.
OAKLAND, Jan. 17.â A chattel mort
gage has been recorded whereby Fremont

ing as security the mortgage on three

fame here and in England. Cash is also

BIRD-NESTERS WILL
BE HALED INTO COURT
EL NIDO MEMBERS SUED FOR AN
OLD DEBT.
They Have Tried to Evaue the Issue
on Demurrer, but Their Success
Has Not Been Assured.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 17.
The liability of the stockholders of the
late lamented El Nido Club of Alameda
will be tested in the Superior Court. El
Nido. as the term in Spanish signifies, is
a bird's nest. In this particular instance
it was a nest or cozy nook in the encinal
city where nightly congregated many of
Alameda/s most prominent and respected
citizens to while away a few hours with
the pasteboards and sip nectar and corn-
Juice. The club was incorporated under
the laws of the State, but was adjudged
insolvent August 3, 1R97. at which time the
indebtedness mounted to $1207 20.
I. P. Allen was appointed receiver, and
on September 1, 1897, a dividend was de
clared by this officer, and a distribution
made pro rata to creditors of $241 44, leav
ing a balance due the latter of $965 76.
Shortly thereafter Assignee Allen
brought suit in Justice Morris" court for
the recovery of $9t>s 76 and costs. Joining
sixty-four members as defendants, and
asking judgment in the sum of $15 09
against each of these Individual share
holders. The case was continued from
time to time and only a few days ago
came up on demurrer before Justice Mor
ris, Judge Marcus P. Wlggin represent
ing the defendants. The demurrer set
forth that the complaint was insufficient
in facts; that It was ambiguous and did
not state whether plaintiffs' alleged cause
of action was founded on claims prior or
subsequent to August 3, 1897.
Judge Wiggln, in arguing on the demur
rer, cited section 322 of the Civil Code,
under which this action was brought and
which Is as follows:
"The liability of each stockholder is
determined by the amount of stock or
shares owned by him at the time the
debt or liability in incurred."
Moreover, Judge Wiggin argued that
the complaint contained no allegation of
the time when any debt of the ET Nido
Club was incurred, hence the insufficiency
of facts to constitute a good cause.
Justice of the Peace Morris entertained
the same view and the arguments of Da
vis & Davis, for plaintiff, could not
change him. He accordingly sustained
the demurrer, from which judgment As
signee Allen to-day filed his appeal.
When Allen originally brought suit the
affair created much surprise and consid
erable consternation, for among the six
ty-four defendants and members of El
Nido were many of Alameda's most prom
inent and respected citizens, business
men and practitioners of the higher pro
fessions, as a list of those who put in
the demurrer above mentioned will show;
the others sued are now resting on thejr
oars, awaiting a final determination of
the issues In the Superior Court. These
are, together with their vocations, as fol
lows: C. E. Elliott, insurance; E. Minor
Smith, City Assessor; A. J. Van Voorhies,
druggist; A. F. St. Sure, City Recorder;
J. B. Lanktree, School Director; H. P.
Morcal, real estate dealer; \V. R. Poy

TO TRANSPORT HOME
THE GALLANT FIRST
A CITIZENS' MEMORIAL TO THE
PRESIDENT.
Copies of the Petition Will Be Posted
at Different Places in the City
for Signatures.
The general and widespreading desire
to relieve the soldiers of the First Regi
ment of California Infantry, I*. S. V.,
from service and bring them home to be
mustered out culminated in a public
meeting of citizens yesterday at the Russ
House. This gathering, which numbered
about 300 persons, was called to order by
Charles W. Moores. A warm interest was
manifested in the matter, and it was the
spirit of the meeting that the regiment
first in the field and first in the con
quered city of Manila has performed its
whole duty, and as troop 3 mustered in
since the California citizen volunteers en
listed are being sent home, there is no I
reason why the First Regiment of this
State should he kept on duty.
The following petition was adopted, and
copies posted at 708 Market street, 1
Powell street, the Russ House and in the
business offices of The Call and of the
other daily city newspapers, where they
await the signatures of those who wish
the boys ordered home:
To the President of the United States and th*
Secretary nf War:
Whereas, The First Regiment of California
Infantry of United States Volunteers were the
first troops to leave the United States for a
foreign port during the war with Spain, having
left San Francisco, May 25, 1898, and have been
continuously In Vervlee away from home longer
than any other volunteer regiment, except the |
First Orpgon Regiment, which went out with â 
the First California Regiment, and whereas, ;
many of the men volunteered and are now j
detained in the service at great sacrifice to
their personal and business interests, and I
â whereas, long detention In tropical climate Is I
undermining the health and spirits of many i
of our best young men who gave their ser- I
vices so cheerfully to their country when hos- |
till ties were actually pending. We, the under- I
6igned relatives, friends and representatives of |
members of the First Regiment of California
Volunteers, most earnestly request that said j
regiment be allowed to return to their homes
and business. If troops are necessary in the |
Philippines, we respectfully request that other
troops he sent to relieve those first sent.
By granting our humble request, you will
relieve many anxious hearts in San Francisco
and vicinity and will gratify the most ardent
wish of almost every enlisted man In said
regiment.

STEWART WAS
ONCE A NOTED
OPERA SINGER
The Porch-Climbing Burglar Is
Identified as Jules
Simonson.
He Is Recognized as the Brother of Mme.
Savile, Whose Voice Captivated
the Critics of London.
JAMES STEWART, the porch climb
ing burglar, who was arrested Sun
day night while in the act of ran
sacking the residence of A. R. Hey
man at 623 Eddy street, was last
i night identified as Jules Slmonson, a
brother of Mine. Savile, the celebrated
; opera singer.
Simonson is also a well-known opera
singer. About a year ago his voice lost
Its sweetness and he started on a career
of crime. Since that time he has en
tered a large number of houses and stolen
valuable property.
For some reason Chief Lee? is deter
mined to shield him, notwithstanding
that he realizes he is a clever burglar,
who would not hesitate to add murder to
his numerous crimes. Thus far only one
charge of burglary has been entered
against Simonson, although Detectives
Crockett and Silvey have sufficient evi
dence in their possession to show that
Simonson has committed at least twenty
burglaries in the past few months. Lees,
In his feeble way, last night not only tried
to shield the prisoner, but also positively
refused to give his true name.
". . "It matters not to the public," he re
marked, with a knowing wink to one of
â his trusted sleuthes, "whether this sup
posed burglar is named Stewart or some
thing else. He comes from a good family
i and I propose not to reveal his true name.
I'm Chief of Police, j.nd I intended to run
this office to suit myself."
When asked if he intended to place ad
ditional charges against the desperate
burgler, Lees childishly remarked that he
CLOSED TWO
VILE CHINESE
LAUNDRIES
Prompt Action of In
spector Dockery.
FOUND FILTH INDESCRIBABLE
COOLIES SMOKED AND SLEPT ON
UNWASHED CLOTHES.
In Both Places the Roofs Were Leaky
and the Seepage Was Allowed
to Collect and Lie Inches
Deep on the Floor.
Health Inspectors Dockery and I^enahan
yesterday afternoon closed two Chinese
laundries that for reeking, sickening filth
could hardly have a parallel.
Both the houses are in the Mission. The I
first one viated w.-is the 'â¢stabllshment of j
"Wing Lung at 1208 Valencia street. This
place is not only vile in appearance, but
He occupants live with an utter disregard
.Ith or cleanliness;. It is a miserable
rickety shanty, and the half-dozen or
more of its occupants live, eat. sleep and ;
work In the same room. A long table |
runs the entire length of the one room,
and the unwashed clothes are gathered
and thrown in a heap under this table.
When night conns each Celestial takes
his < imlortlng opium pipe, crawls under j
t.i table ar;<l settles himself for a com
fortabl â¢ smoke and a night's rest on the
verj articles of i-lothing which the white
patrons of the lllthy den wear the next
The roof i>t this establishment is also
In a leaky condition, and tubs and buck
ets arc- set on the door to catch the seep
age which i.- continually oozing from the
roof. When a bucket gets full it is al
lowed to run over, and the tilth is inches
thick on ihe door, while it hangs like
Btalacites in a cave at every leaky spot
in the ceiling. Mr. Dockery did not wait
to make a very close inspection. He im
mediately ordered all work quit and had
the tires put out. A guard of men was
placed i' the laundry to see that no more
work was done in the building and Wing
Lung wns given twenty-four hours to
pack up ana move out for good.
The other place was the establishment
of Hop Moon at Twenty-second .street and
Ban Jose avenue. It was, if anything,
viler than Wing Lung's filthy hovel. At
one time it had had a concrete floor, but
this was worn away and broken into
holes. These holes have been filled up
â with backs, and, as the roof Is leaky, the
Backs were soon saturated .with the seep
age from above. When the sacks became
â wet the coolies simply threw others on
top of them, and the result is that all
are reeking, filthy and nauseating. The
laundrynien were working in bare feet,
with their trousers rolled up, and would
frequently sink up to their knees in the
slimy mans of rags. Mr. Dockery at once
gave oiiiers that work be stopped, the
place cleaned out, and Hop Moon must
leuveÂ»his disease-breeding laundry within
twenty-four hours and seek a cleaner
abode.
ALL ABOUT BOXERS.
Erne Will Not Fight Under the Aub-
pices of the Olympic Club.
The patrons of fistic sports in this j
city were somewhat surprised yester- !
day on reading a report from some ir-
" responsible Eastern correspondent that
Frank Erne was journeying to this city
ostensibly for the purpose of meeting
"Dal" Hawkins in a twenty-round con
test- under the auspices of the Olympic
Club.
The leader of the club, John Ham
mersmith, stated yesterday that a pro
fessional contest of this kind has never
been taken under consideration, and
furthermore, the Olympic Club does not
propose to give any high-class profes
sional boxing events in future.
Consequently the Hawkins-Erne pro
posed twenty-round contest will have
to be decided under the auspices of
some club unknown to the general
public.
It was whispered around last even
ing that one Ellinghouse, who has been
slightly interested in the past in affairs
pugilistic which had a rather unsav
ory reputation, was somewhat mixed
up in the Erne and Hawkins fistic pie,
and that under his management the
proposed "fake" would be introduced.
Whatever results may accrue from
â would see his men and find out whether
) or' not they had obtained enough cvi
: rtence against Simonson to warrant him
I in preferring other charges against htm.
As it is known that the detectives who
I are working on the case have obtained
! evidence against Simonson to send him
j to the penitentiary for the rest of his

i Detectives Silvey and Crockett, the high-
I born burglar on the evening of December

1R42 Sutter street, and stole several hun
dred dollars' worth of jewelry .\ On Janu

On the same evening he broke into the

I few days later the daring crook visited
the residence of George Abrams at 1144
Turk street and "stole a pair of opera

small amount of money.
In every case he' either climbed the
porch and then entered through an open
window or visited a vacant house adjoin

sacking the Heyraan residence he was
discovered by one of the family and held
until Sergeant Shea arrived. A razor,
which he had stolen, was found in his
stocking. When confronted by his cap

ly disarmed. The weapon has since been
identified as the property of Mr. Salomon,
whose house he had entered.
Notwithstanding that the detectives
have recovered nearly all the property

glarious opera singer, has refused to for

exists between himself and Mr. Haw

The National Club has postponed the
McConnell and Neil twenty-round fight
until the evening of the 24th inst., as
Neil had asked for a postponement be
cause he did not have sufficient time to

Rather than see him enter the ring in

The preliminaries are of high-class or

SHAFTER DUE ON FRIDAY.
His Public Reception Will Be Held on
Monday Next.
The comrrvttee nn arrangements for the
public reception to be given to Major Gen
er..l jhafer met yesterday and completed
all the necessary details. The reception
will be held next Monday evening in the
parlors of the Palace Hotel. The recep-
tion committee will meet in the parlors
at 8:30 o'clock. This committee will be
composed of the most prominent citizens
of San Francisco, and will represent all
of the social clubs and commercial organi
zations. The committee of arrangements
will to-day issue 2000 cards of invitation.
Colonel J. C. Currier, who is a member of
the committee of arrangements, said yes
terday that while the reception is to be
a public one and while any one is free
to come, still, the cards* were issued for
the purpose of keeping out any objection
able persons. The reception committee
will consist of about 100 gentlemen. The
committee will request General Shafter
to make some few remarks, and there is
no doubt that General Shafter will, like
Lieutenant Hobson, address the public
from the gallery on the first floor.
General Shafter is expected to arrive
here on Friday evening or Saturday
morning. After leaving Washington he
telegraphed Colonel William R. Smedberg
from Charlottesville, Va., that he was on
his way to San Francisco and that he
would stop a day at Los Angeles and
possibly one at his ranch near Bakers
field. Colonel Currier stated that in view
of the harsh criticism that had been
hurled at General Shafter, the Loyal Le
gion had determined to receive and enter
tain him, in order to show that none but
the kindliest feelings and highest regard
were entertained for him, but so many
prominent people had also expressed a
desire to properly receive the general that
the Loyal Legion had given way to the
wiFh of the citizens of the city and con
sented to unite in a public reception.

Feroni and His Knife.
Last evening about midnight Louis Fe
roni, a reporter on the Italian paper, was
arrested on a charge of assault with a
deadly weapon at the corner of Kearny
street and Broadway, alleged to have
been committed upon the person of Fran
cis Tettenatl. Tettenatl rushed out of a
cigar store about the hour named with
blood streaming from a severe knife cut
extending from his left ear to his mouth.
Officer Duane was soon on the scene and
the wounded man pointed out Feroni, who
was passing down an alley with his wife,
as his assailant. When searched Feroni
had no weapon on his person, and he de
nies any complication in the affair. Tet
tenati says that no words had passed be
tween them previous to the cutting.

THE Children's Hospital benefit matinee this afternoon promises to
be a great success. Many reserved seats have already been taken.
It now looks as though late comers will have to be content with
standing room. As the programme is a very long one the doors will
open at 1 o'clock and the curtain will go up promptly at 2. Another
volunteer has been added to the list. Julius Witmark. the vocalist
who recently made such a hit at the Orpheum, Is now en route East from his

Assault to Murder in
the City Hall.
MEN AND WOMEN STAMPEDE
JOHN SHAUGHNESSY WOUNDS
W. H- HUGHES.
The Affray Follows a Free Fight in
Hughes' Saloon Monday Night
and Revenge Was the
2totive.
Two shots fired In rapfd succession ti
the Larkln-street corridor of the City
Hall, close to the entrance to Judge
THE SHOOTING OF HUGHES.
Conlan's courtroom. about 10 o'clock
yesterday morning, while the corridor was
crowded with men and women, caused a
general stampede and the wildest excite
ment.
The shots were fired by John Shaugh
nessy, a stevedore, 2S years of age, at
"William H. Hughes, a saloon-keeper at
765 Howard street. The shooting was the
j result of a free fight in Hughes' saloon
Monday night, during which Shaugh
nessy and his father, Martin Shaugh
nessy, 12 Chenery street, were struck in
the face and on the head with an icepick
or some other sharp instrument.
Shaughnessy and his father went into
I the saloon shortly before 10 o'clock and
j Shaughnessy paid Hughes 80 cents
for drinks he owed him. Then a
I stranger got Shaughnessy to shake dice
I for drinks, and when a proposition was
â  made to shake for money Shaughnr-ssy
I objected and the stranger struck him. A
i free fight followed, and Shaughnessy and
i his father came out of it badly battered.
| Detectives Ryan and ODea appeared on
j the secne and Shaughnessy accused
Hughes of striking him and his father
I with an icepick. Hughes was arrested
and booked at the City Prison on two
charges of assault with a deadly weapon.
Shaughnessy and his father were taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where their
wounds were stitched and dressed.
Hughes was released on bonds yester
day morning, and while he was standing
leaning against the West panel of the
door at the top of the steps leading from
McAllister street to the corridor Shaugh
nessy approached him, and. pulling a re
volver out of his pocket, took aim at his
breast, making the shoulder of Attorney
E. T. Dudley a rest for his arm. The bul
let missed Hughes andvstruck the stone
floor, ricocheted and struck the heel of
Eddie Graney's shoe. Dudley had just
time to wheel around when Shaughnessy
pressed the revolver against Hughes'
right breast and another shot rang
through the corridor. Hughes grappled
with Shaughnessy and seized hold of his
right wrist, and In the struggle they fell
to the floor, Shaughnessy on top.
The corridor was crowded with men and
women at the time and there was a gen
eral stampede. Some rushed along the
corridor and others down the steps to
McAllister street, while others ran Into
Judge Conlan's and Judge Mogan's court
rooms. Policeman Tom Ellis of the Har
bor district happened to be coming out of
Judge Conlan's courtroom and he was
the first to reach the struggling men.
He forced the revolver out of Shaugh
nessy's hand and was pulling him off
Hughes when Detective Crockett and Po
liceman Wagner appeared and helped
him. Then a crowd of policemen piled
on Shaughnessy and Hughes was left
lying on the stone floor. He was later
lifted to his feet, and to the inquiry as to
where he was shot, replied "In my
breast." '
He was assisted to the Receiving Hos
pital and after being placed on the oper
ating table Dr. Weil found that the bul
let had struck the breast bone to the
right and glanced along, lodging under
the left nipple, making only a superficial
wound. The bullet was extracted. Be
fore reaching the body it had passed
through Hughes' coat, vest, necktie and
shirt, whtch probably saved his life. The
muzzle of the revolver had been pressed
against the coat and the flash had set
flre to it. Another fortunate thing for
Hughes was that Shaughnessy flred side
ways, which accounts for the course of
the bullet.
Shaughnessy was taken to the City
Prison and a charge of assault to murder
was booked against him. His face showed
the marks of the beating he got the pre
vious night. He admitted that he in
tended to kill Hughes.
"Any man who would hit my old father
with a pick," he said, "I would kill. He
is 63 years of age and never harmed any
body. Hughes used a pick upon him and
me and I wanted revenge. I got the re
volver and made up my mind to kill him
this morning."
Hughes denied that he used a pick or
anything else upon Shaughnessy or his
father. The Shaughnessys got into a
fight and who struck them he did not
know. At one time he was a witness in
the Police Court against Shaughnessy.
who, he said, had been threatening him
ever since.
Judge Conlan was in his chambers
when the shots were fired. Clerk of the
Court Rice was at his desk and he made
a break for the Judge's chambers. Bai
liff Kelly ran into the corridor and Of
ficer Maurice Behan remained at his post
and kept his eyes on the prisoners in the
dock, as some of them were attempting
to climb 0%-er the railing to make their
escape in the confusion. Behan had to
get a long pole and whack them over the
head to compel them to desist in their
attempts. Judge Mogan was on the bench
and remained there. Bailiff Barry and
Officer Coughlin rushed for the corridor
and the prisoners in the dock began to
clamber over the railing, and one of them
almost succeeded in getting over before
they were subdued. There was a general
rush from police headquarters, but the
danger was over before any one could
reach the scene.
CLAIM THAT
MRS. SLIHKEY
WAS MURDERED
An Anonymous Letter
Charges Foul Play.
CORONER WILL INVESTIGATE
BODY TO BE EXHUMED AND THE
STOMACH ANALYZED.
It Is Insinuated ; That the Husband
of the Dead Woman Is Impli
cated in Her
Death.
Acting on an anonymous letter, which
asserts that Mrs. James E. Slinkey, who
was found hanging in a closet at her
home, 110 Ellis street last Friday, was
the victim of foul play, Coroner Edmund
E. Hill will to-day at noon exhume the
body from Laurel Hill and remove the
stomach in order to ascertain if possible
whether or not the woman came to her
death from poisoning.
The letter was received by Dr. Hill on
Sunday. It was postmarked 6 a, m. of
that day and had been mailed at the main
office. The writing is evidently that of
a woman. It reads as follows:
, Dr u, E U Hlll: Mr8 ' Slinkey'g death. Inquest
of this date, waa not suicide, as she was an
Invalid for over a year, and at the time of her
death could not move or lift even a pin. She
could not, under any circumstances, have com
mitted self-destruction unless she had taken
poison. As she did not do suoh, then others
hastened her end. This demands an investi
gation for the commonwealth. I have also
written the Chief of Police and Journals of this
city and will, when occasion offers present
myself with evidence. Living at his (Mr
Sllnkey's) house I know all. Kindly Investi
gate, as I am the only friend his wife had,
as he Is cohabiting with a woman who is at
present with him. He has declared if his
wife was dead he would be all right. This
is not written In malice, but In a spirit of
Justice. a FRIEND.
After receiving the letter Coroner Hill
consulted with the police, and Detective
Dillon was detailed on the case, but
nothing can be found to throw any light
on the matter. Dr. Hill decided yesterday
that he would have the body exhumed
He has invited Drs. Hughes, Gallagher
and O'Brien to be present with himself
and Dr. Zabala, the autopsy surgeon. The
stomach will be removed at the cemetery
and then the body will be reburied.
Mr. Slinkeiy visited the Coroner last
night, at the request of the latter, and
seemed very much surprised at the inti
mation in the letter that he was guilty of
the murder of his wife. He said the letter
must have been written by an enemy
probably a woman, but was unable to
form an opinion as to the author's Iden
tity. He denied that there was any truth
in the statements made in the letter, but
said to Dr. Hill: "If I am guilty I want
to be punished." An effort to see Mr.
Slinkey at his lodging-house last night
proved futile. The office boy admitted
that Slinkey was in, but this was vigor
ously denied by John Dem, a brother of
the dead woman. Dern stated that he
was of opinion his sister's death was
a plain case of suicide, but that If he
thought there had been foul play he would
leave no stone unturned to bring the
guilty party to justice.
It is very doubtful if the analysis of
the woman's stomach will bring any proof
of poisoning to light. Dr. Hill said that
strychnine or any form of opium could
easily be determined. The fact that the
body had been embalmed probably with
arsenic would be sufficient to make use
less any evidence which might be offered
that arsenic was found in the stomach.
When the autopsy was performed the
stomach was accidentally punctured and
THE ACCUSING LETTER SENT TO CORONER HILL
/
a portion of the contents spilled. This is
another barrier to the investigation, as it
is possible that there was not enough
left in the stomach to analyze.
Dr. Hughes, who attended the woman
for some time before her death, was
called to Dr. Hill's office last night and
asked his opinion of the case. He stated
to the Coroner that, while he said nothing
at the time and made no objection to the
opinion of Dr. Zabala that death was
caused by strangulation, he had .thought
that the Jungs were not sufficiently con
gested for a person who had died from
strangulation.
If the woman was murdered and then
hanged to the door of the closet it is the
opinion of Dr. Hill that she was not dead
when the rope was placed around her
neck. He bases his opinion on the fact
that when the body was found the eyes
and tongue were protruding. Had the
woman been dead when hanged this
would not have been the case.
The brother of Mrs. Slinkey attributes
her suicide, as he calls it, to the fact
that she was despondent over the loss of
property at Sausalito. In support of the
suicide theory he quotes Dr. Hughes, of
whom Mrs. Slinkey made Inquiries as to
whether death by strangulation was pain
ful. He says she had read the suicide
of Mrs. McQuewan and talked a great
deal of it.
One point which was overlooked by the
authorities when the body of the woman
was found is that the nails to wh!en the
rooe was tied were wrapped with a man's
handkerchief. This was evidently done
to keep the rope from slipping. Should
thÂ» handkerchief be found and identified
it might be of value as evidence, even
though it is admitted that Mrs. JJlinkey
ha"l tree access to her husband's effects:.
Dr. Hill places little credence in tliv
charge made in the letter, but he will
nevtrthf.kss make a thorough investiga
tion tf the case.

night, stated that the report that his late
