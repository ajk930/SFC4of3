â¢ ALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 4.â lt has remained for
John T. Gaffey to put Colonel Burns in
the way of making an up-to-date Sen
atorial canvass. Gaffey pays: "When
making a Senatorial fight ply your
guests with liquor." Burns' latest In
structions to his lieutenants are:
"When making my fight for Senator
take your guest? to the French restau
- and give them a dinner a la
carte."
Vacillating legislators are the guests |
of honor at many a festive board and
Colonel Burns and Uncle Collis pay the
bills. It is comparatively inexpensive,
It is new and it has what novelty there
is in attempting to reach a man through |
h!S stomach Insteadâ trf" through his
pocket. The pocket treatment will come |
later. The little dinner parties are
made up in the proportion of one timid
legislator to three, political touts. It
is a good thing for the touts and a |
saving in expenses to the legislator. A I
tout turned entertainer is a man to be .
ht after. The money in his pocket
Is not his own and his anxiety to show
a proper unfamiliarity with the menus
of Barbary Coast coffee joints makes
rder everything on the bill of fare,
being certain tha by doing so he will
iTi i t any particular portion of food
that is familiar to the table etiquette
of his guesi
The heavy frost that struck the Burns
boom immediately after the colonel
the general public into his < .infi
dence concerning his Senatorial inten
tions is still in evidence. Duck dinners
dealt out with a lavish hand to legisla
f all degrees have had no effect
in raising the temperature around the
Burns headquarters in the Goklen
Kag:- The restaurant keepers
are ex; trieocing a boom, but Senatorial
mihtr scarcer every day.
The arrival of Moses Gunst .n the
Ecen> the Burns crowd for a
moment and n. i other shock is exp< I .
until the announwm"nt is made that
' M' we ha* went."
Just when this interesting event is
expected to occur is not known even to
Governor Gag.-, and if he knew he
would not tell.
If it la true, as Governor Gage said
to-day, that "s-lf-int- rest is often raor
ally blind." then it may be that Mr.
Gunsts championship of the Senatorial
candida< y iâ¢: his gambling: partner,
Burns, is a sort of moral blindness due
to his .i-s::- -o retain the office c-f Po-

the star events of the near future.
Major McLaughlln, chairman of the
Repu State Central Committee, is
using: his Influence In the Interest "f
andidacy, and In doing bo Is
providing food for pertinent g
ainimg those members of the Legisla
ture who hail from districts outside of
San Francisco. Not beins? familiar with
metr< politan mÂ»-th"d* of "doing" poli
tics thesi legislator! are recalling the
h mad< by Major Mclaughlin at
the ii'tial session of the State Central
< omttittee just before the opening of
th<* recent campaign. <m thai occasion
the major made himself popular by de
ing against the political manipula
tions of the Southern Pacific Company
8:;U apgerting that he would fight the
corporation to the hitt>-r end. Because

plauded hy The entire Republican j.r-.s.j
<ri the State. Major M< I^ughlin be
came involved In a heated controversy
\vith Hosa Jim Rea of San Jnge. Th^Â«.'
things are still fresh In the minds of
country members and they are wonder
ing why Mclaughlin and Ttea hive
joined hands in supporting Dan Burns
for Senator in face of the fart that \V.
F. Herrin has declared Burns to be the
The San Francisco Call.
Southern Pacific's candidate. It is a
knotty problem and one that is beyond
solution as far as the average legis
lator is concerned.
Burns says: "I am a candidate. '
Herrin gays: 'Burns is our candi
date."
Mi.Laughlin says: "Burns is my can
didate."
Now the legislators are anxiously
awaiting the arrival of at least one
San Francisco merchant, business man
or citizen of standing who is willing
to make a similar declaration. A care
ful canvass of the men who are in Sac
ramento in the interest of the Burns
boom makes it reasonably certain that
the business Interests of ether com
munities are not suffering: because of
the absence from home of merchants,
bankers and tbe solid men Â«( these
communities.
While it is known that Burns has
lost strength since he announced his
candidacy, it is also apparent that the
opposite state of affairs is the case
with at least three of the other Sena
torial candidates. Bulla. Barnes and
Grant have all experienced an accession
of strength. George A. Knight is not
making an aggressive fight for Sena
torial honors, though he will make a
fair showing when the first ballot is
counted next Tuesday. The Grant
boomers are, as usual, claiming every
thing in sight, and if their professions
are to be believed they have the ficht
already won. ThHr activity in rootine
for more votes is sufficient evidence of
the unreliability of their claims. Amone
those who are hÂ» j re h>~'lp!nK to spend
Grant's money is a man who was a
member of the last Assembly. At that
time he lived in a lodging house and
took his meals at cheap restaurants in
of the fact that he was drawine
$> a day from the State and his wife
was in receipt of a like amount for her
ser\ Ices as a committee clerk. This
same man is to-day living in an ex
pensive suite of rooms at the Golden
Kagle Hotel and is making a great
show of prosperity. Comment is un
:.>â¢â  â¢ ~sary.
So far as outward appearances go,
< Irant seems to be the good thine of
the ?essi<m and there is no apparent
scarcity of men who are ready and
willing to spenl his money for him.
The Grant men are boasting that
they have gained three votes to-day,
and that all of them aTe men who were
believed to be favorable to Colonel
Burns. It was ascertained late to-night
that one of the legislators who has
gone over to the Grant camp is Senator
E. I. Wolfe "f San Francisco. Wolfe
has corroborated this information.
Burns has all along claimed the entire

blow to the Burns nroters.
BURNS SURROUNDED
BY AN ODOROUS GANG
A Motley Crew of Tenderloin
Politicians Working for the
Man of Unsavory Record.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MKXTO, Jan. 4.â The men who are out to
elect Dan Burns Senator, no matter what
the moral penalty or financial cost, are
here in .'I their m !<jut and najseatiug
variety. They adorn every chair and pil
lar of the Golden Eagle office and adja
cent bar rooms, and every train is bring
ing others.
If it may be judged from the motley,
od< roue nang that has foregathered here
during this past week tl>- dives and dead
falls of San Francisco, where cheap poli
ticians wax lean through the months on
occasional political pickings, ar.' deserted
by their habitues. The metropolis has
debouched the greater part of it? un
healthiest element, pass and good Herrin
dollar laden, on hitherbound trains, and
toe result is a fair example of what the
result would be should the daily dimin
ishing chances of El Alcalde be success
ful.
It is not fair to say. though, that all
of the Burns adherents here are of the
lower ordÂ» r. There are those here who
;ir> in the fight purely as a matter of con
science tor '.)>..â  liquidation of past politi
cal debts, though just what political debt
is due Mr. Hums from James Alva, Watt
remains yet to transpire. It may be that
the obligation is purely anticipatory, but
the, fact remains that James Alva is here
and in the fight to the tinisii. Mr. Watt
is on>- of Mr. Burns' workers. It was
Mr. Watt who wits accused of having re
ceived $4000 from Moses Sherman, the
arch manipulator who wrecked the Peo
ple's Hank, to be used in influencing
Judge HÂ«-bbard in appointing a receiver
for the bank who would be satisfactory to
the crooked plans of the cliqu- that had
handed together to rob it. That story.
however, has been since ups^t by Mr.
Watt's simple denial.
Coworklng with him are Mr. Kellyâ
Martin Kellyâ and Major McLaughlin.
The greasy Kelly figure is one too famil
iar in politics and the Burns ranks to de
mand explanation in the present instance,
but in view of the fact that only two
weeks ago Major MeLaughlin is said to
have remarked in a Santa Cruz bar room
that the candidacy of Dan Burns for the
United States Senate was enough to make
a decent Republican throw up his hands
and anything else he might have about
his person leads to the logical conclu
sion that the chairman of the State Cen
tral Committee has thrown up his self
respect along with his hands and things
and gone over to the source of the emetic.
Ami then there is Leon Dennery.
"Mo" *>unst. Mexican Dan's gambling
partner and Police Commissioner, sup
porter of free roll faro banks
and crap games, consort of race
track touts and owner of innumerable
slot machines, Is another of the cleaner
element here and he Is not slow in the
expenditure of ample slices of the profits,
that are accruing' out of the prominent
industries ho has fostered.
Julius Waller is here, too. Julius has
not cut any great slice in the political
bedquilt up to date. }<*V. a nice .little
-gentleman, with a six-by-six head anil a
two-by-two intellect, and his unhallowed
prominence comes out of the, fact that
he owns Sam "Waller, as brother. Mr. Wal
ler is also decidedly for Burns.
Mr. Herrin and ,his railroad are demon
strating the. fact that they are out of pol
itics by sending into the thick of the fight
Harvey Lindley of Los Angeles, whose
profession is politics; R. B. Carpenter,
who, though most too old to work, has a
good punch. in him still, and proposes to
use it for Burns; Jake Shaen, Jake Step
pacher and Walter F. Parker.
xierrin has sent Parker up for the ex
press purpose of giving the double cross
to â¢ Robert Bulla : and his Senatorial as
pirations. He has permuted himself to
be advertised as one railroad official who
has seen the fight and become a friend
of the Southron, but it is come to be a
well-known fact that he has simply in
gratiated himself for th.> purpose of
learning the Bulla strength and where it
lies, that he may wield the," ax with
greater effect when the word from his
master comes.
These are only a few of them.. There
is a horde of otners. but like some good
stories, they are not tit for publication
But enough are mentioned to give a. fair
idea of the Burns. adherents; and- an un
savory. odorous. layout .it is. Rake the
list with a fine, tooth comb and the only
thing that will come out of it is a prac
tical politician who is in the fight ' for
politics and its perquisites, and for noth
ing else. It is a list picked out with no
discrimination. They are < Burns' sup
porters, and as such they are the people
to whom he will owe the obligations of
his election, if elected he should be, and
it has never yet been said of .Burns that
he shirked a political debt. - In -the whole
unsavory lot there is not, to -be found \,a
solid citizen of any community.
Business men are conspicuous by their
absence. The clean politician isn't men
tioned. Not a srtvoo! nnr university In"
the commonwealth. is represented. It, Is
the tout and the -grafter, 'whose life and
living are in politics and' what can be
made in it in the devious ways known
only to the professional, who are fighting
with their last gasp for Burns' electio,.
What the promised reward is. of course,
purely a matter of conjecture.
Paris Kilburn. ex-Surveyor of the port
of San Francisco, ex-Bank Commissioner
and one full of the sentiment that-"grati
tude is a sense of favors to come," ar
rived from San Francisco to-night to help
Dan Burns.
CALIFORNIA PLACES THE HELM
OF THE SHIP OF STATE IN THE
HANDS OF A NEW STEERSMAN
Amid Popular Acclaim and Booming Cannon
Governor Gage Is Inducted Into Office.
The New Executive Outlines His Views on Affairs of Moment Concerning the
Commonwealth, and Suggests Legislation That May Tend to Remedy
Many Evils Which He Has Discovered Are Detrimental
to the Welfare of the State.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 4.â Henry T. Gage is
now the Governor of Californiaâ not
the Governor of Republicans alone, but
the Governor of all the people. He was
inaugurated with the pomp and cere
mony that is a necessary adjunct of
such an occasion. It is creditable t" thÂ»-
management of the inaugural commit
tee of the Senate and Assembly that
everything passed off with celerity. The
military was out in sufficient force to
indicate that soldiers can be had in
time of peace as well as in war. The
field and staff officers of the National
Guard in their glittering uniforms gave
color to the procession and the State
officers lent dignity to the occasion.
The weather was propitious and the in
c>rning Governor was got. J-natuved
and genial.
About 11 o'clock this morning Gov
ernor Gage drove to the capital and
j paid the customary visit of courtesy
!to the outgoing Governor. James H.
; Budd. The new and the old exchanged
! friendly greetings in the rooms of the
Executive Department. Then the new
Governor came back to the ( Jolden
Eagle Hotel and placed himself under
the guidance of the inaugural man
ager?. Presently he was surrounded
by generals and culonela and can
didates for office.
Senator Dickinson in the full uniform
of a major general looked distinguished
and impressive. Brigadier General 11.
1,. Peeler was hardly less conspicuous
than General Dickinson. Brigadier
General R. H. "Warfield was the center
of admiration in one section of the ho
tel. For military dignity blended with
the charm of personal beauty Colonel
\Y. D. Sanborn was easily enough en
titled to the inaugural cake. Special
and exclusive privilege of escorting the
ladiesâ Mrs. Governor Gage and Mrs.
Governor Budd and their respective
companionsâ was accorded to Colonel
Fred Burgin and Colonel Jefferson Doo
little. If Colonels Giestlng, Vail, How
-1 ell, Beck, Young. Andrews. Miles, Jan
sen and other military chieftains felt
envious of the proud distinction con
ferred on Colonels Burgin and Doo
little they managed to conceal their
emotions of envy and perform the duty
assigned in a highly commendable
manner. The absence of Colonel Chad
bourne was the only gloomy incident of
the inaugural occasion.
Seated in comfortable and clean car
riages the officers felt perfectly at borne
and maintained excellent alignment on
the route to the Capitol. The carriage
in which (Governors Gase and Budd and
Supreme Justice Henshaw were seated
, was drawn by six spirited white horses.
i The Lieutenant Governor, Jacob H.
Neff, the outgoing Lieutenant Gover
nor. William T. Jeter, and Howard
Wright, Speaker of the Assembly, oc
cupied another carriage.
Before the procession of State and
military dignities was organized the
ladies who graced the occasion were es
corted to the Capitol by the officers as
signed to that agreeable duty. The
ladies escorted by Colonel Burgin were
Mrs. Henry T. Gage, Miss Rowena
Burns, Mrs. W. H. Davis, Miss Maggie
Eastman and Lucile Gage, daughter of
Gnvt-rnor and Mrs. Gage. Jefferson
Doolittle was the escort officer for Mrs.
James H. Budd and Mrs. Budd, the
mother of Governor Budd.
Governor Budd. in returning Gover
nor Gage's official and friendly call,
svas accompanied by ex-Adjutant Gen
eral Barrett, Adjutant General Peeler
and the entire staff of the outgoing
commander-in-chief. In due form, they
were presented to Governor and Mrs.
Gage by Colonel Fred Burgin. The
presentation ceremony took place in
the rooms adjcining the parlors of the
Golden Eaele Hotel. A pretty incident
of the presentation was the expression
of mingled surprise and delight in the
eyes of little Lucile Gage when she
gazed at the glittering array of offi
cers.
Shortly after the ladies took their
leave General Barrett marshaled the
staff officers and State officers and di
rected the procession to move. The
short journey to the Capitol was made
Without special incident. The trans
portation facilities were ample and no
one entitled by courtesy to ride was
permitted to walk. Ths trip was made
along X and Tenth streets to L and
along L to the north entrance to the
Capitol grounds and thence along the
paved way to the west and main en
trance, where the principals and escorts
alighted a..d formed in line to move to
the Assembly chamber. Meanwhile
large throngs of the resident popula
tion wended their way to the CapitoL
The galleries of the Assembly chamber
were quickly tilled. The corridors were
packed by late comers, who could not
gain admission and it was with diffi
culty that the places reserved for Sena
tors and State officers could be pro
tected from tht? rush of people to gain
seats.
In due form the Joint convention was
organized. Lieutenant Governor Jeter
directed Frank Brandon, secretary of
the Senate, to call the roll of Assembly
men. The presence of a quorum of each
house was announced. The Sergeant
at-Arms heralded the committee of the
Senate and Assembly. The audience
was apprised that the big- lights were
not far behind. Presently Senator Cut
ter, chairman of the inaugural commit
tee, spoke out loud, saying: "The.
Governor and the Governor-elect of the
State of California."
Lieutenant Governor Jeter respond
ed: "They are invited to the Speak
er's desk."
Accordingly, Governors Gage and
Kudd and Justice Henshaw ascended
the steps to the desk. When quiet was
restored Rev. Mr. Sturlevant, chaplain
of the Senate offered a prayer as fol
lows:
Almighty God. we acknowledge thy
hand in all the affairs of human govern
ment, and we ask that thy especial bless
ing may be present on this auspicious oc
casion. We pray thee that thy blessing
may be upon thy servants, their Excel
lencies the Governor and Lieutenant 9b v
ernnr of this State. We pray thee that
thou wouldst bless them abundantly in
their own personal affairs ami we ask
that thou wouMst give an abundant bless
ing to our State during their term of
office. O Lord, may thy blessing rest
upon those who retire from office. Wilt
thou grant them thine own presence and
blessing? We pray thee that thou wonldst
be with us iMs day and guide us in all
the aflairs of life. For Christ's Bake,
amen.
By this time the Assembly chamber
was packed to its utmost capacity. It
was all a scene of brilliant coloring.
From the chandeliers on each side of
the desk of the Speaker trailed long
strings of smilax and fern, picked nut
with carnations ;md rarest of orchids.
On the desk more orchids and blos
soms and potted plants lent their i
while on the clerk's desk in front palms
and violets, tropical ferns and carna
tions of every hue completed the effect.
In harmony with the rest were the
gowns of Mrs. Gage and little Lucile,
and for that matter the beauty of the
rather notable party that accompanied
them in the chairs placed for them just
before the rostrum and the brave blue
and gold and the military trappings of
the staff officers who sat near them
played their part in one of the hand
somest of the many decorations that
have in years past made the Assembly
chamber beautiful.
On the announcement by Speaker
PKICE FIVE CENTS.
Wright that Supreme Justice Henshaw
would administer the nath of office to
| the Governor-elect, Henry T. Gage, the
! joint convention anti the spectators
j arose. Justice Henshaw administered
the following oath, which was repeated
I by the Governor:
"I. Henry T. Gage, do solemnly swear
: that I will support the constitution of
the United States and the constitution
of the State of California, and that I
will faithfully perform the duties of
the office of the Governor of the State
of California according to the best of
my ability. So help me God."
Mr. Gage repeated the words in a firm
and distinct voice, placing a little em
phasis on the last sentence.
Immediately after the oath was ad
ministered the vast audience cheered,
the band played inspiring music and.
cannon on th<- Capitol grounds boomed
jT"stg"n'aTTh"*rt fne'new Governor was in.
When the enthusiasm subsided Gov
ernor Budd arose and introduced his
successor in this style: "Since my in
auguration, some four years ago, one
j of the pleasantest moments of my life
is that in which I present to you my
; successor, the Hon. Henry T. Gage,
i now Governor of California (Applause),
i and I predict for him a prosperous and
I an able administration. Governor Gage,
| T introduce you to the people. (Pro
i longed applause.t
Responding to the introduction. Gov
; ernor Gage read from type-written
j sheets the following inaugural ad
dress:
THE INAUGURAL ADDRESS.
Gentlemen of the Senate and Assembly
of the State of California and fellow citi
zens:
To faithfully fulfill the solemn duties
imposed upon me by the official oath Just
administered is my unalterable purpose.
Individuals arc. at best, but weak in
struments to guide- the destiny of a State.
Conscious of this truth, and" being fully
aware of the grave responsibilities inci
dent to this sacred trust of office now
Imposed upon me, in order that I may
be rightly guided in my public duties. I
humbly repose my faith in that Omnis
cient Power which alike directs the
course of nations as individuals.
Our country has just emerged from a
foreign war. Springing from the highest

our heroes who died in that great eaus-i
we know that their deaths were not in
vain. History will he tender to their
memory; our flag will more proudly wava
above th>- soil that shelters them; "Ur
country will enshrine their marvelous
deeds.
As a result of that contest Spain, crip
pled and bankrupt, pays it? debt to Amer
ica by the cession or territory. The peace
ful acquisition of the Hawaiian Islands,
extending our empire beyond our Pacific
shore, should be followed as a political
necessity by the annexation of the Phil
ippines, 'lhe center of commerce must
move westward. California, favorably sit
uated, will among other advantages r .tp
the harvest of trade with these new ter
ritories, developing our many varied anil
growing resources, creating ;â .â¢ western
merchant marine for the carriage of our
imports and exports and luring to our
market the nations of the world.
The Ni'-arapuan canal, soon to be
opened under the fostering care of Amer
ica, will give us a short; eastern outlet
and the great feat of our ocean fortress, .
the Oregon, will never again be a neces
sity.
I'nder these promising prospects the
Philippines must he retained. No short

The construction of the trans-Siberian
Railway will tiring the wealth of Russia

Asia and Africa will l>e bound to us by
the golden cords of commerce. Within
sight of such a future, we. ourselves,
must assist in the development of this
State. We must be neither niggardly nor

preceding session of the Legislature. The
spirit of obbylng is too prevalent and
should be ch< k'-<i.
It fosters a corrupt sentiment that it
is lawful to rob the St
ople who are scrupulously con
tious in their private dealings with
one another. acl â  this spirit, do
! not hi si tat c to demand Improper or
ssive appropriations or to attempt
to secure the approval of dishonest
claims. The interest of the State should
be the interest of every citizen. The
t of the State Is as Bacred In owner
ship as the money of the Individual.
Although the tct providing for boun
- has long since been
repealed claims aggregating (287,615 are
; likely again to !â â¢ presi ntea at this Bes
sion of the Legislature. In the second bi
ennial message of Governor Markham,
I January 7. 1895. attention was called to the
that the State had been shamefully
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANTARY 5, 1899.
i defrauded by the payment for scalps that
had been shipped into the State from
Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and Mexico.
Governor Budd, ii; his first biennialmes-
January I, 1897, recommended that
in any appropriation mad< for the pay
ment of these coyott scalp claims,
amounting to $287,615, provision should
be made that the Board of Examiners
should take evidence as to the validity of
the claims befon allowing them. In that
â¢ ction he said: "1 am convinced that
- have b( en perpei rated on the pi o
ple In the presentation and manipulation
of these claims In several of the counties
of the State, and while the claims from
many oi the counties of the State are un
doubtedly just, If the Board of Examiners
be given the above power, and false
swearing thereunder he mad'- perjury, 1
am confident that there will be effected a
large saving of money to the State."
In the last report of the Controller for
the fiscal years ending June 30, 1897, and
Jinn- 30, 1898, attention is again called to
claims in the following language:
"I have again included in my estimate the
amount due to creditors of the State for
bounty on coyote scalps. The greater part
of these are legitimate claims and the
is legally responsible for their pay
ment. I have no doubt there are among
them many that are fraudulent, but these
may be segregated from the honest
claims, and the latter should be
without further delay."
From thÂ»- foregoing reports it will be
observed that these claims, amounting to
$287,615, arc as a whole tainted with the
fraud, and the honest claims, if any. are
â  i -â  â  â  rated from the dishonest de
mands and should be segregated before
any appropriations therefor be made.
The holders oi these claims must not BX
from me more !cnier*cv than the*
have received rrom my predecessors, 'l
trust that you will closely, scrutinize these
claims before allowing any appropriations
ever.
It is my inflexible resolve to oppose all
.-â¢ and excessive appropriations as
well as all other improper measures with
a firm veto.
It may not be out of place here to call
ition to the exorbitant cost oi our
elections by reft r
rinr. among other
matters. to the
single item of ad
vertising constitu

usually been valuable assistants in urg
ing economy in the administration of gov
ernment, yel Borne of them appear to
overlook this matter when presenting
their own Ciaims against the State. Self
interest is often morally blind.
Newspaper claims (some unauthorized)
aggregating over $60,000 have been pre
si nted against the State for the mere
public attention of the constitutional
amendments voted upon at the last elec
tion. When the newspaper proprietors
now urging these (bums properly reflect
upon the matter their good sense will. I
think, suggest that even newspapi r
claims against the State may be excessive
and in that sense unjust.
I have approximately estimated that the
people of this State are taxed under the
present election system at the rate of
about $2 50 for every ballot cast and
counted at each general election. It is
astounding that such expense should go
along- for years uii' hallenged. If we are
now to have a primary election law. such
primary i lections should under no cir
cumstances be made a tax upon the peo
ple, as under the present general election
system, otherwise it would largely in
crease the present extravagant tax bur
dens.
Some immediate action should be taken
to relieve the people of this State from
the enormous expense of conducting elec
tions, rather than Increasing them.
This administration is confronted by
startling claims of various counties
against the State, amounting to about
$1,500.00). for commissions alleged to be
due such counties from the State for col
i' cting State taxes.
Although these commissions were abol
ished by the act of the Legislature, ap
proved February 23, l^T'3. contracts have
been made by these counties with attor
neys to enforce the collection of such
commissions.
The spirit of tho county officials which
inspires those demands is neither patriot
ic nor businesslike. The officers of the
countiGÃ should remember that' these suits
if successful will "return to plague the
Inventor" in the form of Increased tax
ation. The people of the State will be.
moreover, ultimately compelled to pay
through taxation whatever amounts may
be expendi d by the several counties for
th( compensation of counsel and the pay
ment of the other expenses incident to
the litigation; and sir.cc the counties form
| a part of the State it is clear that they
will gain nothing by thr litigation, but
sustain a ioss of whatever sums nre paid
in their atti nipt to collect these commis
si> ins.
Furthermore, should these suits suc
<> ed, tlie State Treasury would be drained
of the necessary money to pay its cur
â  expenses for at least six months,
and until the receipt of money from the
State taxes of the next fiscal year. One
Of the technical points raised by the in
genuous counsel for tin counties against
the State is that the act of February 2."?,
1893, last referred to. was' not passed by
ri vote of twenty-one Senators. As
suming that the Supreme <"ourt should
decide that it could look behind the en
rolled bill (which, however, should not be
law), my personal examination of the
original roll call shows that the act In
question was passed by the requisite vote
of. namely, twenty-one Senators, but a
mistake arose in the printing by the omis
sion of the name of one Senator.
This leads me to say that laws passed
by the Legislature should be most care
fully and closely examined in both Sen
ate and Assembly before final action
thereon; otherwise serious errors may
arise, entailing expensive litig-atlon. as in
this instance, and also possibly jeopard
ising public rights.

language of the section is certainly am
biguous as to the time when this list
should be furnished to the Troasun r and
I am informed thai it has not been cus
tomary to issue such lists in advance of
the presentation of the warrants. This
is a very serious matter for the State
Treasurer, aJJQIt would not be a difficult
task for a forger to alter the face amount
of these warrants, which are frequently
assigned by the holders and pass from
hand to hand.
The subdivision referred to should be
amended bo as to require the Controller
to furnish the Treasurer with a iist of the
warrants and their amounts as Boon as
drawn, and in advance of their pot

California cheerfully furnished to the
Federal Government soldiers in defense
of the Union, and while the nation had
the right to this support it had no righi
to the money, amounting t" over $4, ,000,
which the State advanced for the equip
ment of its volunteers, and this money
should be now restored to the State with
interest.
Our Senators and Representatives In
Congress should be requested to use every
lawful effort tor the passage of a bill al
lowing these war claims for at least
$3,951,915 42, the amount allowed In the i
Congressional bill, to which reference has I
Jllst Wen made.
These war claims are both just and
equitable, and the State has long and
patiently waited for this settlement.

ing, through settlement and cultivation,
the value of such land and adding largely
to the population and wealth of the State
and nation.
Our Senators and Representatives in ;
Congress should bo requested to introduce
a measure to secure Federal aid in this I
direction. Our State has not been mate- â¢
rially benefited through the laws enacted
in respect to irrigation districts under the
Wright act. unfavorable results have
followed the so-called Wright act, burden-
Ing the land owners, imposing additional
taxes and causing perplexing litigation.
While Borne portions of the State have
been favored through it other parts have
been injured. Bonds aggregating a large
sum of money have been Issued upon the
doubtful securities afforded by several ir- j
rigation districts, and in main- cases even
the interest on these bonds has not been |
paid, so that the bonds themselves are '<
practically unsalable.
Some measures should be adopted which
will prevent the continuance of such un
desirable conditions and put an end to the
litigation and loss consequent upon this
class of legislation.
The completion of the work already be- '

Notwithstanding the great ability and
untiring energj of the learned Justices
of our Supreme Court and of the Suj n me
Court Commissioners, experience lias
demonstrated that it Is Impossible for
them to dispose of the fast accumulating
legal business coming befor< them. I
therefore recommend that an amendment
to the constitution be adopted for sub
in to the electors, establishing an
intermediate appellate court, having final
jurisdiction of a large class of cases which
now comes within the jurisdiction of the

also Indispensable that they be disposed

Considering the official burdens thus

your assistance, as well as upon that of
the several State officers, in placing the
government upon a proper business basis.
it lias been impossible for me, with the
means at my disposal, within the lim

oath of office, t'i make a very extended
examination of State affairs; hence ray
references in this address t" the few mat

As to Other matters of state, which
may have been omitted and which may
hereafter cull for legislative action, I
will communicate by special messages my
views there on, as the occasion arises.
While much rests with the executive,
grave labors devolve, likewise, upon you.
In order that the happiness and prosper
ity of the people of this great State may
be secured and augmented. Your patri
otism and your sense of moral responsi
bility will guide you In your deliberations
and lighten the burdens of the executive.
The faithful administration of the pub
lic affairs of the State Implies the indi
vidual as well as the public good. Inc
money of the State is most securely
guarded, and the rights of the people i est
preserved, when honor is placed above
the emoluments and self-love yields to
love of country.
Inspired by these motives, let us co-op
erate' in the firm, brave and honest dis
charge of our sacred official trusts.
The members of the Legislature and
spectators listened with marked atten
tion to the delivery of the address. Ap
plause was evoked when the sentiment
in favor of retaining the Philippines
whs uttered. The allusion to the amount
charged by the newspapers for publish
ing constitutional amendments created
a ripple of merriment and caused slight
applause. Perhaps neither the audi
ence nor the Governor understood that
the amendments were published by offi
cial direction and that the charge ren
dered by the newspapers was the regu
lar rate for the space occupied and is
the same as is paid by private indi
viduals.
Immediately after the minutes of the
session were approved the joint conven
tion dissolved. Thereupon Governor
Budd escorted his successor to the ex
ecutive office and there surrendered
everything in sight to Mr. Gage. Pretty
soon Governor Budd's staff officers filed
in to pay their respects to their com
mander-in-chief, and they were also
sin rendered to Governor Gage. As the
new Governor reviewed in his glances
the fine figures of Colonel Joe Howell
and genial Colonel Beck and the rest of
the heroic band his eye sparkled with
delight. He must have said to himself,
as he looked at them: "This is worth
all the struggle for the office." Later
on members of the Legislature, State
officers and ladies and gentlemen resid
ing in Sacramento came forward to
greet the newly inaugurated executive.
The Democrats of the Legislature did
a graceful tiling. They called in a
body to pay their respects to Governor
Gage and give a parting salute to Gov
ernor Budd. The ex-Governor, accom
panied by his mother and wife, left
Sacramento on the 5 o'clock train for
Stockton. The Democratic legislators
went tn the railroad station and there
bade him good-by, with many wishes
for his future prosperity and happi
ness.

MENTO, Jan. 4.â The Dmnaocritlc mem
bers of the Assembly met in mucus this
afternoon after the adjournment of the
Assembly for the purposeof considering
the matter of committee appointment*
and making recommendations to Sneaker
Wrigrht as to the personnel of the Demo
cratic representation upon House i >m
mittees. A number of committee Belec
tlona were decided upon, but the entire
list was not completed. Another meeting
will be held ai 9 a. m. to-morrow, when
the list will be made up and turned over
eaker Wright.
it was decided to hold a Joint caucus
to-morrow evening to select a candidate
for United States Senator.
It la now quite evident that in the be
ginning the I>Â« mocratlc m> mbers will vote
as a unit for a Democrat for Senator..
The names of some half a dozen promi
nenl Democrats will be presented to the
caucus to-nirfht. Assemblyman Boone .or
Tulare would like to have a complimen
tary vote given to William H. Alvord.
Assemblyman Sanford will present tne
name of w. \v. Foote.
Assemblyman Meade. who is a close per
sonal friend of Senator White, inter
viewed that eentleman before lie left Los
Angeles as to whether or not he d<
his name presented, anil the Senator
I that Inasmuch as be had with
drawn from the Senatorial contest prior
to the election of the Legislature he
did not think it was scarcely the nroper
tiling for him to be in the race now.
Under the existing circumstances th*
Senator does not think thai the caucus
nomination of the Democratic minority .is
tlal as an Indorsement of his six:
years' term In the United States S.
The Senator stated to Assemblyman
Meade that if a Democratic majority hnd.
been elected to the Legislature his name
would not go before the Democratic cau
cus, and as there was a Detnocritic mi
nority, he did no: see why it should.
M F Tarpej will have his name before
thi caucus, and his friends will urge him
strongly.
It is evident, though, that oi all tho
names that will be presented. James p.
n will have the strongest following
and more votes than any other gentleman
whose name will be offered. The chances
are n rÂ»1 thai Mayor Phelan will
be the nominee of the Democratic caucus,
unless some trade is made to give a com
plimentary vote for '>n.' or twd ballots to
some of the other leaders whose names
will be presented. '"â¢
While the Democratic members of tnÂ«
. will ai tli.> rumrnenoement of
balloting for Senator proceed on the
proposition of voting .for a Democrat, it
must not be understood that they pro
to urn quivocally continue to do so
to the end. If the occasion demands.
there are a number of Democratic As
semblymen and Senators who boldly an
nounce thai they propos* to step into the
, cast their ballots to save the fair
of the State, even if they are com
pelled t.i vote for a R< publican.
At best, in so far as the Senatorial con
test is concerned the action of the Demo
cratic caucus will be lightly regarded.
The Democratic members of the As-
Bembly are already acquainting them
selves with th< Republican candidates.
This evening Assemblymen Fairweather,
Boone Mead< . Burnett and Mack met by
appointment at the Golden Eagle ami
called in a body at the headquarters of
all the Senatorial candidates. They were
presented to the various gentleman .and
ti!.;i withdrew. It was simply a little ir
formal affair and devoid of any Btfcnin
â¢ other than that the I >emocrattc
brethren were desirous of meeting person
ally the men whose names after Tuesday
â  will occupy the att< ntion of the State
for several days t 'me.
UNCLE BILLY BOWERS
SIZES THE SITUATION
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. A. â Oim: of the. old-time
politicians of California is . ex-Congress
man W. W. Bowers of San Diego. Down
in the Seventh Congressional .District,
which he for six years represented in the
halls of the National Legislature, the
men and women refer to him as Uncle
"Billy" Bowers.
There is one quality Uncle Billy has. He
is very plain spoken. He has partici
pated in a number of Senatorial fights in
California in times prone by. for he has on
several occasions, going as far hack as
1876 been a member both of the Senate
and of the Assembly. Since Monday the
ex-Congressman has been here watching
the Senatorial fight and as a loyal San
Diegan doing what he can to assist in
booming Mr. Grant. Asked to: give his
views on the situation as he looked upon
it to-night. Uncle Billy in characteristic
language said:
"Well, now, I'll tell you. There is no
man got this light won now. It's the fun
niest thing I ever saw. There are factors
at work in this bout that I never saw he
fore in any Senatorial fight. The one
thing that complicates more than ' any
thing else is the patronage of the State
administration. That's what mixes the
thing up so that men don't know where
they stand. I want to tell you that if. you
will take the patronage of the State ad
ministration out Of this battle U. S. Grant
will get the caucus nomination beyond
the question of a doubt."

how he looked, but he did not strike
the spectator as one destined to startle
the nation by loosing his lungs at

Bulla was already at his post of duty
in the Senate. Even now it is impos
sible to state definitely how the struggle
will terminate. I have said from the
first that the man from San Diego will
win. partly because his principal op
ponent is Burns and partly because, if
the worst charge to be brought against
him is that ho is a carpet-bagger, his
record must be clean. There are other

in California. It makes no difference

thing like an organized plan of cam

There is something in bearing an hon
ored name, and General Grant, the
great soldier, the head of the nation,
had been regarded as a failure until he
had passed the age at which most men
were well on the way to such success
as life afforded. This candidate is a
quiet, unobstrusive man, making no
boasts and thus coming Into violent
contrast with the citizen of Yolo, the
ex-Secretary of State, the miner of
Candelaria. The contrast is working
him no injury.
There are many of the people here
who have no excuse which they are
willing to reveal. They are either after
jobs or they hope to boost the aspira
tions of somebody who is, and come in
for a share "f the proceeds. In some
instances their ambitions are leeiti

and they who will not ask may s:o hun

why he is here a suspicion arises that
he is for Burns. The only open sud

who apparently thinks he is strong;
enough to uphold Burns and remain
unspotted. While this is impossible,
the uselessness of telling him so is
plain.
There is a little story worth telling,
and not likely to get any space else
where. Years ago Governor Budd haJ
defended a man tried on the charge of
murder and the case had been tried be-
Judge Budd. The prisoner was
found guilty of murder in the second

thirty-five years. There were mitierat-
Ing circumstances of no consequence in
this narration. Enough to say that as
Governor Budd would have pardoned
an. save for a feeling of delicacy
owing to having been his lawyer, thn
retiring executive presented the facts
to the incoming Governor and asked
that Gage issue the pardon. He was
told in a cavalier fashion that Gaze did
THE CHARTER WILL BE RATIFIED.
CALL HEADQUARTERS.. SACRAMENTO. Jan. 4.â There is no longer any
doubt whatever that the new charter adopted by the people of San Francisco will be ratified
by the Legislature. Some weeks ago The Call made a poll of the Legislature by telegraph,
and. while a majority of the members of both houses declared in favor of its ratification, there
were a number who expressed a desire to more thoroughly familiarize themselves with the
instrument before committing themselves for or against it.
During the present week The Call's staff of correspondents has made a systematic and
intelligent canvass of the Legislature, with the result that it is enabled to announce to the peo
ple of San Francisco that there will be practically no opposition to the charter in either House.
And there will be little if any delay in its ratification. It will be presented to the Senate and
Assembly to be acted upon as soon as the Legislature is in smooth working order, and there
is no likelihood that any effort will be made to block its course.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 4.â About the only work ac
complished by the Senate was the revis
ion of the number of standing committees
and putting through the mileage claims
of the officers and members.
The standing committees were reduced
from twenty-nine to twenty-six in order
to give each Republican member a chair
manship, which reduction was accepted
without detriment to the work of the Sen
ate. The Claims Committee was consol
idated with the finance, and the Commit
tee on Constitutional Amendments with
the Judiciary, while the Committee on
County Boundaries was abolished. Be
yond shortening the names of some of
the others they were allowed to stand as
they were in the last session.
When the Senate met at 10 a. m. Gillette
of Humboldt offered a resolution appoint
ing a committee of three to amend Bi i -
ate rule 36. relative to the standing com
mittees. The resolution was adopted, and
Gillette, Bulla and La Hue were appointed
on the committee.
Simpson of Los Angeles offered a reso-
lution appropriating $4::.". for lighting the
Capitol dome and the Senate chamber next
Monday night during the inaugural ball,
purchasing new canvas to cover the floor
of the Senate chamber, and for cleaning
the old canvas, which is to be used to
cover the stairways. The resolution was
adopted, and the Senate adjourned to
meet in joint session with the House at
1 o'clock. â¢
At the close of the inaugural ceremonies
the Senate* reconvened and Jacob H. .Neff

QUICK WORK IN THE HOUSE.
After Passing the Bill for the Print
ing Office the President
Was Indorsed.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 4.â To-morrow the State
Printing: Office will be privileged to draw
nn the StKte treasury fur as much as its
needs require of the $50.0 XÂ» appropriated to
its use by Assembly bill No. 1, introduced
in the Assembly Monday morning by
Grove L. Johnson of Sacranunto. To-day
its third reading and final passage were
the first business of the Assembly at its
morning session.
The bill us originally introduced pro
vided $100,000 for the Immediate nei
the office, and in such terms it passed
without a dissenting voice to its second
reading:. Yesterday it came back from
the printing office for further action, but
the tip had come into the chamber that
Governor Gage would attach his v< to to
it unless th( appropriation was cut in
half, and the little joker in the shape of
a proviso that "In cases of emergency"
work might be done by private offices out
side the Si ;> cut out of it en
tirely. Mr. Johnson took the hint
when it came up after the reading
journal yesterday morning he asked that
the Assembly go into committee of the
whole for the purpose ot amending it
the llnea laid down. The commlt
Â» f the whole reported the amendment
favorably to the Assembly, and the bill
passed to Its third reading, which waa
made a special order for this mi r: >â¢
ter th^ reading of the journal. This morn
ing It was ttikt-n up and passed, and thu
minority declared its position on printing
office matters by casting not one vote
against it.
The $60,000 tendered by Mr. Johnson, on
behalf of the Assembly, is only tht- first
of other appropriations that are to come.
Since the office was peremptorily <
work has accumulated, and it is fon
ed by thÂ« wise ones that th^ session of
this year will be dragged out to i
days because of it. The work to be done
on the report of the Code Commission
alone will reo.uire not a day short of
â
three weeks and if the commission is to
'' render Its report to the legislature this
year the printing of it must be first com
i pleted.
To-morrow the bill will be rushed in to
the SÂ»:: "â¢ . and und< r a suspension of the
provisions of the constitution will be
its first, second ami third readings
and sent to thi Governor for his signa
ture. It will become immediately opera
tive.
The printing bill and the small debate
upon its passage was the only business
;of import. I the Assembly .hir
ing the morning. It was all inauguration
in the eh;tmS>-r from tht time Speaker
Wright called for order, and adjourn
ment was taken early to facilitate the
arrangenv ating the big crowd
that was expected in the afternoon :
I Governor Gage inducted into office.
The resolution of Belshaw of Contra
â¢ i introduced on Monday with the
intent of ratifying the policy of Presi
-1 dent McKinley in the late war and for
the future, came up on its second read
ing. Meade ol Los Angeles, leader of the
minority, introduced a substitute elimin
iting all reference to the President and
;erritorial expansion.
Grove L. Johnson said he would vote
tor the Belshaw resolution, but wished
to say he <1 i â¢ 1 not consider the late un
â¢leasantness either a Republican or Dem
ocratic fight, but that honors were even
between all the parties on the ticket.
<'aminetti said about the same thing
and moved that the resolution be re
ferred to a 'â¢â â mmittee that it might ba
revised to include the opinions of both
majority and minority.
Dibble of San Francisco said he did not
-f-e how that could be done and Burnett
>f San Luis Obispo pot up to say he did
lot like the- resolution for the reason th;it
t made no reference to holding on to tha
Philippines ami other territory that the
uition had acquired only after erlmson
ng it with tht- blood of American soldiers.
Speaker Wright said the question was
in the motion of Camlnettl to refer to
jommittee and 'he motion was lost. Then
t was on the sib-measure of Meade. and
that also was lost. The original resolu
tion came then and it cam d with only
the minority vote against it. Valentine

beautiful castles to be built by the loving
hands of mutual helpfulness and filled
with healthy, happy children.
Almost without exception these dreams
might become realities if mothers would
only teach their daughters the most com-
mon, sense facts about their own physical
make-up, and advise them how to protect
themselves from the perils of the three
critical periods of their puberty or
maturity, motherhood and the "turn of
life." Women at these times suffer from
irregularities and weaknesses which, if
neglected, will develop into dangerous dis-
eases and make their whole lives wretched.
The delicate organs that make wifehood
and motherhood possible, cannot be neg-
lected with impunity. If they are neglect-
ed the result is unhappy wifehood, and
motherhood 'will, be a menace of death.
Dr. Pierce 's Favorite Prescription is an un-
failing specific for all diseases of these
organs. It restores them to perfect health.
It promotes regularity of their special func-
tions. It fits for wifehood and mother-
hood. It tones, invigorates and builds up
the nerves that have been shattered by
pain and suffering.
"For years my wife suffered from what the
doctors called prolapsus of the uterus," writes
Mr Harry Chant, of 211 Haskell Street, Dallas.
Texas. "She was nervous, had cold hands and
feet, palpitation, headache, backache, constipa-
tion, a disagreeable drain, bearing-down pains
and no appetite. She pot so weak she could not
get around. lam only a laborer, and was always
in debt to the doctors, and all for no good, as none
of them did her any good. She began taking
Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription and it seemed
to 'work like a charm. She t^s taken about
thirteen bottles and is to-day as stout and
healthy as any. woman in the United States."

ROOSEVELT TO
DECLINE THIS
EMPTY HONOR
No CF)eap Brevet Ranl^ for H im
When He Feels That He Has
Won a Medal.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â The friends of Governor Roosevelt in this city
were not pleased when they read in ihe Herald to-day that the War De
partment had recommended to the President that the colonel of the
Rough Riders he made a brevet brigadier general and that the President
would act favoring the recommendation.
If Colonel Roosevelt is made a brevet brigadier general he will prob
ably lifeline the honor, and there is reason to believe that the head of
the War Department knows that Colonel Roosevelt will decline.
Colonel Roosevelt's friends say that what he wants is the medal of
honor to which he is entitled, and which the War Department is with
holding because of th^ colonel's famous "round robin." They also say
that th^ manner in which the brevet rank is to be given, in connection
with other volunteer colonels who were not under fire at all, is humili
ating.
The Btory as was told to-night is that Colonel Roosevelt was recom
mended for a medal of honor by General Shatter, General Wheeler and
General Wood. Thus the corps commander, division commander and
brigade commander joined In the request. No doubt, it was said, the
medal of honor would have been given but for the fact that Colonel
Roosevelt's desire to get hia troops away from Santiago when they
were likely to die of yellow fever stirred up the War Department.
Tlie news from Washington is taken by Colonel Roosevelt's friends
to mean that the recommendations of Generals Shafter, Wheeler and
W 1 are to be Ignored and that Colonel Roosevelt is nut to have his
m< lal of honor, but an empty title instead, the same as Colonel H. T.

Special ("able to The Call and the New York
Herald Copyrighted. 1898, by James Gor
don Bennett. _
PARIS, Jan. 4.â There seems to be a
growing conviction here that the New
foundland question will furnish the
next subject for discussionâ some even
go bo far as to say for disputeâbe
tween England and France. The mat
ter has been referred to many times
lately. Mr. McGrath, editor of the St.
John Evening Herald, has contributed
an article to the current Contemporary
l;. lew wherein the English view of the
case is given and reprisals are
threatened if satisfaction be not ob
tained.
"Satisfaction" appears to mean in the
nt case that the French should
withdraw from the stand they have
taken on their incontestable legal rights
guaranteed them by the treaty of
Utrecht. These rights have no longer
any raison d'etre, according to the
English. Mr. Chamberlain has pointed
out that at the time the treaty was
concluded the fisheries were uf great
value; now they have become compara
tively i'.isigniii( ant.
Hear Admiral Reveillere, in a letter
written to-day to Le Matin, says the
French Bhore is of no interest to our
navy. He affirms that the question of
the French shore- in Newfoundland is
us only because it has been ab
surdly exaggerated by professional
patriots.
"The English have never disputed the
rights of France," he writes. "They
only say nothing can be nv>re true than
that our ] ;; the French shore
Is a source "f perpetual danger from
conflicts which have only been averted
by extreme good will on the part of
both governments.
"It would certainly be of benefit to
both nations," concludes the admiral.
"if our rights could be exchanged tor
an equivalent compensation. I posi
tively affirm, certain that I shall not
be contradicted by any officers Who
know the Newfoundland station, that
the French shore is of no interest to
our navy."
Marc Landy, in Figaro, admits that
tli" entire territory in dispute is not
worth the blood of a single French
Bailor. "We should be well advised In
accepting compensation in exchange for
this stretch of coast," is his conclusion.
The question is will both parties ap
proach the subject in this conciliatory
spirit.

H. J. Bray. One of the Best Known

VANCOUVER, B. C. Jan. 4.â H. J.
Bray, one of the best known fruit mer
cnants in this city, was charged in the
Police Court this afternoon with having

peatedly to Bray Ujey instituted a crimi
nal action against him. This deal in it
self in not a large one, but it is said that
other fruit firms in San Francisco have
similar complaints to make against Bray.
Bray'a arrest to-day created a great sen-
Bation in commercial circles, as he was
alwaj a held to be a man of good financial
standing. lie requested and was given

Declares if the Scheme of the Attor

Social rÂ»l!=r.at?h to The Call.
PAX RAFAEL, Jan. 4.â S. M. Aug
ustine, cashier of the bank oj A. P. Ho
taling & Co., filed a communication to
â the Board of Supervisors with County
Clerk Graham to-day, in which the
; San Francisco law firm which has se
'â . cured contracts to collect money al
leged to be due the county from the
'State is excoriated in the bitterest
! terms. Augustine declares that it is an
'attempt to take money from the pockets
nf taxpayers already overburdened,
â characterizes the attorneys as "cormo
rants," "vampires" and "bloodsuckers,"
and petitions the board not to become
i a party to what he regards as so mere
tricious a scheme.
After stating that the law firm has
secured contracts by which it will make
$700,000 in fees, provided ail the suits
against the State are won, and that if
this county should win its suit it would
lose $8000 out of the $20,000 claimed on
the basis of a 40 per cent fee, Augustine
declares himself in the following force
ful language:
Concerning the moral aspect of the case
I can hardly trust myself to speak, nor
can I characterize such practice as it <i, -
serves. Tho distinguished attorneys who
conceived this scheme of enriching them-
I selves at the expense of the toiling masses
of California, who are already in bad
enougH straits as a result of an unu
sually dry year, may anticipate an easy
victory. l,m in my '.pinion they undi rrate
the intelligence of the people of the Stati
who, if I mistake not, will be heard from
in no uncertain tones when they once un
derstand this proposed raid upon their
property through the technicalities of le
gal practice.
You were assured that the money to ~ay
this judgment is already In the State
treasury, appropriated for this pui
Had this been true, it would have been
to the interests of this county to com
mence suit to recover it; but it is no) true.
This money is in the pockets of the
taxpayers of tne county and State, and
if paid at . r ill we must pay it t<> ourselves,
and, besides, pay these cormorants,
varopln b, these bloodsuckers, literally for
the privilege of doing so.
An attorney in private practice would
be disbarred for betraying the interests
of hi? client. Why should these men be
permitted to do it on a gigantic scale
without a protest? Tlk- contract was
obtained from you fraudulently and can
be set aside on that ground, and we look
to you, gentlemen, with absolute confi
dence in your integrity and good inten
tion, to protect your constituents against
this Iniquitous attempt upon their rights,
and thereby to aid in setting the teal of
infamy upon the nun whose minds were
cunning enough to conceive this nefarious
scheme, and whose hearts wire base
enough to execute it.
To-morrow's session of the board will
be devoted to a consideration of the
proposition of rescinding the contract
with the law firm in question. District
Attorney Mclsaac will be asked at that
time to present an opinion in the
matter.

The Supreme Court of the Islands De
cided in Their Favor, and an
Appeal Has Been Taken
to Washington.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Office, Riggs House,
Washington, Jan. 4.
Assistant Secretary HoweU of the
Treasury Department has under con
sideration the cases of a number of
Chinese seeking; readmiasion to Hawaii,
and has submitted the questions in
volved to Attorney General Griggs. At
different periods before the annexation
of Hawaii to this country many Chinese
left Hawaii with the intention of re
turning after going to China on visits
or engaging in business elsewhere. They
compiled with the Hawaiian laws en
titling them to return.
When they learned of the annexation
of the islands and the establishment of
United States laws over Hawaii many
<if them hastened back to the islands.
Inspector Brown of the United States
Gi .rnment denied them admission on
the ground that under the law.s of the
United Stuns they were not entitled to
come back. The case was carried be
fore Justice Judd of the Hawaiian Su
preme Court. He decided that the
Chinese ought to be admitted.
Brown has taken an appeal to the
Treasury Department, and the case will
be given careful consideration. Under
the laws of this country a Chinese go
ing away must secure from the Collector
of the Port from which he sails a cer
tificate that he has a family or prop
erty here and is entitled to return with
in a year.
The attorneys for the Chinese in Ha
waii maintain that it is unfair to en
force the laws of the United States
upon people who went out of Hawaii
believing that tiny could return under
the laws which then existed. It is
thought likely that the Attorney Gen
eral will uphold the decision of the Ha
waiian .lu.lp.- and admit the Chinese.
Nearly 800 Chinese will be debarred un
less the decision holds.

Special Dlsratf-h to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â The first
session of the Senate after the holidays
occupied only fourteen minutes, al
though in that brief time two open ses
sions and one executive session were
held. â 
The galleries were filled with specta
tors before the Senate convened, the
general expectation being that the
i peace treaty would be presented. The
Senatorial members of the Peace Com
j mission appeared on the floor and were
given a hearty greeting by their col
leagues.
In the absence of the Vice President,
Frye of Maine, the president pro tern,
called the Senate to order.
The chaplain in his invocation said:
"We come together under a sense of
bereavement by the absence of the
Benior Senator of Vermont, whose wise
counsel and loving presence shall no
more enrich the proceedings in this
chamber. We Mess Thee, Â«i Lord, for
his noble life; for his example to all
men, ami we pray that his spirit may
ever abide within these walls."
Scarcely had the clerk begun to read
the journal of the last session of the
Senate when Davis moved that the
further reading be dispensed with. The
motion prevailed.
Frye, who was in the chair, immedi
ately recognized Major Pruden, as
sistant secretary of the President, who
presented a message from the President
of the United States. The message con
tained the treaty oÂ£ Paris, on motion
of Davis the Senate then went into ex
ecutive session in order that the treat>

The Deadly Cyanide of Mercury Sent
to Cornish by Some Enemy

Athlete.
Precial Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â ThP police have
three men under surveillance in con
nection with the Adams-Cornish poi
soning and would have arrested one or
all of them had it not been for the fact
that none of these suspects has a light
heard. Miss Miller, the saleswoman
who sold the match holder in Newark,
is positive that the purchaser had a j
light beard. It is said that should the!
police discover that any of the suspects
purchased a false beard an arrest )
wruld immediately follow and that the
police would then believe that they had j
a good chance to secure the conviction
vÂ£ Mrs. Adams' murderer.
Professor Wltthaus, who has been I
analyzing the contents of the bottle out
of which Mrs. Adams drank, to-day
made his report to the District Attor- I
ney. Professor Witthaus said defl
ly that the poison in the bottle sent t<>
Cornish was cyanide of mercury and
that he believes the sender <â¢!' the poi
son must have been eithei a < Ivinist or
one with an intimate knowledge of
chemicals. Professor Witthaus a Is..
says that the bottle containing the pdl- '
son was not a bromo-seltzer bottle,
though a label taken from a regular
bromo seltzer bottle had been pasted !
over this hottle.
All the suspects are said to be men
who had g: udges against Cornish.
Detective Captain McCluaky has
given out a statement made by Dr.
Henry Beaman Douglas relative to his
treatment of H. < '. Barnett of the 1
Knickerbocker Athletic Club, who died
in November, 18;<S, ten days after hav
ing partaken of a powder which he had
received from some unknown person
through the mails. Mr. Barnett was
treated by Dr. Douglas, who declared i
that he was suffering from diphtheria.
Interest in the case was revived on ac
count of the death of Mrs. Kate Adams
from partaking of a portion "!' the con

at the Knickerbocker Club by some un- i
known person. Following are extracts'

symptoms of cyanide poisoning, and the
only evidence of any mercurial poisoning
was such as any man might have devel
oped after taking a medicinal dose of cal
omel, t believe that Mr. Barnett died of
heart failure following diphtheria, which
heart failure was brought >m by undue
exertion. I do not believe any mercurial
poison contributed in the least to cause
his death.
Captain McCluskey had in his posses
sion the sample package containing the
remainder of the Kutnow powders,
which Mr. Barnett had left when he
died. This package was sealed, and
Captain McCluskey said that he would
give the bottle, as it was given to him
to-day, Dr. Witthaus the exnert
chemist.
In speaking of the sending of the
two poisoned packages of powders, one
to Barnett and one to Cornish. Captain
McCluskey said: "The same party sent
the two poisons, it seems to me."
He refused to discuss the case in any
of its phases, but said that he did not
expect to effect any arrest in the case
at once. _______^___

Cipher Dispatches Received From the
Philippines Have Created the
Wildest Consternation in
Administration Circles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â
Administration circles were
thrown into consternation by the
receipt of a dispatch from Gen
eral Otis to-night giving the de
tails of a plot among the Fili
pinos, under the leadership of
Aguinaldo, to resist American
control in the Philippine Islands
by force of arms if necessary.
Owing to the reticence of the
â¢als little beyond that hinted
at above can be learned regard
lie contents of Otis' dispatch.
That it was deemed of great im
portance is evidenced by the fact
that upon its receipt at the War
Department it. was ordered im
mediately transcribed from the
ripher and taken at once to the
White Mouse for submission to
i he President by General Corbin.
At the War Department it was
ordered asserted that Otis had
Aguinaldo under surveillance,
but at what point the dispatch
didn't set forth. It was given as
an opinion, however, that the in
surgent leader is at Malolos,
where he had called the insurgent
Congress to meet on Thursday,
which is to-day in that longitude.
Why, if Aguinaldo's influence
is feared or if he is believed to be
inciting the natives to insurrec
tion, he is not under arrest, is not
explained. In fact, it is believed
by army officers that Aguinaldo
has been arrested and that the
revolution or insurrection against
American authority is really on,
and that this portion of Otis' dis
patch is being withheld from the
public.
There is much gossip in mili
tary circles regarding the ability
of Otis and Miller to hold their
own against the insurgents if in
reality an uprising has occurred.
In a dispatch last night Otis ex
pressed the utmost confidence in
being able to cope with Agui
naldo's army should a conflict oc
cur and said his force was large
enough to meet any emergency.
His sending the First Califor
nia Regiment to reinforce Miller
nt Iloilo is taken here as proof
that reports of the size of the Fil
ipino army on the island of Lu
zon have been exaggerated.
General Otis has now at Manila
19,000 men. and it is regarded as
certain that he would not have
reduced his force if Aguinaldo's
army had been larger than his.
The insurgents suffered great
ly in effective strength through
the capture by Dewey of the
steamer Abbey, with 400,000
stands of arms and ammunition
for Aguinaldo.
It is not denied here that Agui
naldo has plenty of men, but the
War Department is counting as
effective, in the event of a clash,
only those Who carry rifles.
When a military official was
asked to-night â  how many men
Aguinaldo had in the vicinity of
Manila he said:
â¢ "It is pretty hard to tell where
the army leaves off and the mob
begins."
If any notice was received from
Otis up to midnight that he had
issued his proclamation to the
Filipinos it was not made public,
and at the War Department,
when told that The Call had a
cable to the effect that the proc
lamation had been madej it was
THE FILIPINOS MUST
LAY DOWN THEIR ARMS.
MAXILA, Jan. 4.â A1l is quiet here. The American troops which arrived
at lloilo have not landed. They are awaiting instructions. The native gov
ernment is firmly established there.
The merchants all desire that the Americans shall plant a firm govern
â  ment in the islands.
A proclamation, based on the cabled instructions by the President, was
Issued by General Otis at 5 o'clock this evening. The proclamation says it is
' the intention of the United States to draw from the Filipinos as much of the
military force of the islands as possible and to seek the establishment of a
most liberal government, in which the Filipinos will have as full representa^
â¢ tion as maintenance of law and order will permit.
No mention is made of the kind of government to be established, or of
' the number of representatives the Filipinos will be allowed to have, two points
" on which the natives are extremely anxious for information. The proclama
. tion is also indefinite on other points.
A demand is made that the Filipinos lay down their arms, but no date is
â¢ set for them to do so.
said that while it might be true
it was considered doubtful, as it
was not believed Otits would
take such an important step with
out informing the home Govern
ment of it.
Otis' plan, as outlined in dis
patches received yesterday, was
to publish the proclamation in
pamphlet form and distribute it
at all important places, including
Malolos, where the delegates to
the Filipino Congress were to
gather, in order that the latter
might be fully informed of the in
tentions of the American Gov-'
ernment before taking any action
in the matter of sanctioning
Aguinaldo in further opposition
to American control.
The Navy Department re
ceived dispatches from Dewey to
night, but according to the story
given to the press these related
only to sending war vessels to
the ports of the Philippines to an
nounce the assertion of American
control.
THE CALIFORNIA BOYS
NOT HOMEWARD BOUND
Call Office, Rlggs House.
Washington, D. C. Jan. 4.
When the formal order was to-day
issued mustering out the Eighth Cali
fornia Regiment and companies B and
C of the California Heavy Artillery the
Adjutant General said incidentally th.it
nothing- definite could be saM t s to the
First California Infantry, now at M.i
nila or Iloilo. The regulars are ex
pected to leave New York in a week or
ten days. It was expected that several
of the regiments of volunteers at Ma
nila would be relieved upon their ar
rival, and that the First California
would be among these. But the
trouble with the insurgents, especially
at Iloilo, may change the situation.
The department hopes that these
troubles will be speedily settled, but
ti;- officials have no Information upon
which to predicate an opinion of the
real situation there. The officials are
anxiously awaiting advices and honing
that those advices will show a chance
for the better.
It is the general opinion, however,
that a conflict cannot be avoided if the
United States forces attempt to land
at Iloilo. Of course a landing could
have been effected by force at any time
the forts were shelled, the city re
duced and the insurgents driven out.
Such a course, however, is just what
this Government is most desirous of
avoiding, and consequently General
Miller has used only conciliatory meas
ures in dealing with the natives.
In the meantime, however. Aguinaldo
has been scouring the adjoining islands
fnr native reinforcements, which have
poured Into Iloilo every day. greatly
Increasing the army there. It is thought
now that should General Miller attempt
to land in spite of the prohibition of
the native chiefs a bloody battle might
ensue.
The last dispatch received at the War
Department from General Otis an
nounced that he would send the First
California Regiment to reinforce Gen
eral Miller. The published dispatches
from Manila this morning announced
that this had been done. The regiment
was embarked on the transports Cam
pania and Maritima and convoyed to
Iloilo by the gunboat Concord.
This action of General Otis was some
what of a surprise to department offi
cials, as he had been instructed to do
nothing which would weaken his force
at Manila. He was not absolutely
bound by those instructions, however,
and the fact that he has sent reinforce
ments to General Miller is thought to
indicate that he regards the situation
at Qoilo as Berious. General Miller has
now something over : j ,000 men under
him. The cruiser Baltimore is the flag
ship of the small naval detachment
there, which is commanded by Captain
D y er - * i
The Insurgent forces numbered only
about 1500 when the city was turned
over to them by the Spaniards, but they
have been greatly augmented since. It
is feared that Aguinaldo is organizing
his forces t<> resist Americans wherever
resistance is possible, and a dispatch
announcing that a conflict had taken
place would cause little surprise at any
time.
THE SPANIARDS DENY
CHARGE OF BAD FAITH
MADRID, Jan. 4.â The statement that
the Spaniards evacuated Iloilo in order
to render the situation difficult for the
Americans is positively denied. The
Government, immediately after the
treaty had br-.i signed, ordered the
Philippines evacuated as quickly as
possible, in order to avoid further
bloodshed and to conform to the ex
pressed wish of the Americans, who
were very exacting, especially in the
case of Cuba.
An interview with an ex-prefect of a
province of the Philippines is published
here, in the course of which he is quoted
as saying:
"President McKinley has shown com
plete ignorance of the situation in the
Philippines. When the Americans oc
cupied Manila there were only four in
surgent provinces. The Americans en
couraged the revolution and now they

themselves are the victims of the sup
port which they gave the insurgents,
who have become masters of the entire
archipelago except Alindanao, where
the natives, who are Mussulmans, re
fuse to recognize American rule al
though they have not revolted.
"Aguinaldo's unpopularity is due to
his friendship for the Americans. His
treatment of the Spanish prisoners has
been horrible. Monks have been
marched through the streets led by
cords attached to rings through their
noses and others have been employed
literally as beasts of burden. A thou

MAJOR ESTERHAZY
SUMMONED TO APPEAR
Will Be Free From Arrest While
Going To and Coming From.
Paris.
PARIS, Jan. 4.â Major Comte Ferdinand
Walsin Ester hazy, now known to be the
I author of the Dreyfus bordereau, has
| been summoned to appear before the
I Court of Cassation on January 12. It is
understood that though no formal un
dertaking has been given, he will be freo
from arrest coming and going.
It is expected that the Dreyfus deposi
i tlons will be received on Saturday from
Cayenne, and the court will then decide
whether his actual presence is necessary
in Paris. It is believed, however, that the
whole examination will be conducted by
telegraph, at an enormous expense, in or
der to avoid dangerous manifestations

"IT'S ABSURD," SAYS

Says the Pope Would Not Interfere in
His Appointment to the Peace

NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â A St. Paul special

Archbishop Ireland to-night, referring to
the dispatch that came from the London

not allow him to accept an appointment
by President McKinley to the St. Peters
burg peace conference, because the Vati
can was not to b<: represented there.
"I have not been appointed by the Pres

"Secondly, if I had been appointed it is
absurd to suppose the Holy Father would
say a word about it."

SOAPY SMITH'S
IMITATOR LYNCHED
AT EAGLE CITY
Jack Jolly, Sa!oon=Keeper and
Desperado, Is Given Short
Shrift by Enraged
Miners.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Jan. 4.â W. Devine of San Francisco, who
arrived here direct from Dawson to-night on the steamer Rosalie,
says that Jack Jolly, the wealthiest gambler and saloon-keeper in
the northern gold fields, was lynched on December 11 by a vigilance
committee of Eagle City, Alaska.
The story of Jolly's death is full of dramatic incidents. He at
tempted with a gang of reckless men to be the "Soapy" Smith of Eagle
City. As robbery after robbery occurred in his saloon sober-minded
miners warned him that he was going too far. He laughed at them,
and finally they formed themeslves into a vigilance committee. Jolly
was given forty-eight hours to leave town. He dared the vigilance
committee to drive him out and called his gang around him. Fifty
minors, fully armed, surrounded his hotel on December 9 and de
manded his surrender. Jolly's followers abandoned him, and after a
bloodless struggle the desperado was captured. He was taken to a
tree near his saloon and was given three minutes to say his prayers.
Curses were his answer.
The end came quickly. A noose was thrown around his neck and
while his thoroughly cowed gang watched from a distance he was
swung up, dying game to the last. According to Devine, Jolly has had
Eagle City in a state fo terror formonths. He defied the law and no
respectable man was safe in his saloon. Several Montana miners
commenced the agitation against him and the feeling of the better
element became so strong that it was known two months ago he
would either have to leave town or die. His tragic death caused a
sensation in Dawson, where he was reputed to be worth several hun
dred thousand dollars.
Jolly originally came from Nevada. He was a splendid specimen
of physical manhood and was a power among the reckless element
of the north on account of his extreme daring. Devine, with W. H.
"Walsh of Portland, left Dawson December 12, being the last to come
out. He made the record trip of the season, reaching Skaguay in
seventeen days.

CONCENTRATION OF
CUSTOMS MONEY
Excitement at Santiago
Uncalled For.
CUBANS ARE TO BE AIDED
COMMUNITIES CANNOT HAVE
ALL COLLECTED.
However, Proper Orders Have Been
Issued for the Belief of Dis
tress Existing in Various
Quarters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4.â Regarding
the sensational reports from Santiago
that the whole province has been in
flamed by the recent order of the War
Department "concentrating all customs
money in Havana," thus threatening a
stoppage of all public improvements
and threatening to throw thousands of
Cubans out of employment, it may be
authoritatively stated that any excite
ment existing in Santiago is due to a
misapprehension of the War Depart
ment's order. It seems to have been
taken for granted that the order con
templates sending all currency collected
for customs dues to Havana, and thus
cutting off the Governor of Santiago
province from the employment of local
labor. The fact is that the officers in
charge of customs at the various i><>rts
of entry are merely ordered to "make
weekly reports to the collector of cus
toms of the island at the chief port of
all transactions at the sub-port over
which he may have jurisdiction, with
copies of entries of merchandise duly
certified."
The customs from all the ports of the
island are to be used for the benefit of
the Cubans, not only in Havana and
Santiago, but elsewhere.
Expenditures will be divided as equit
ably as possible, so as to- relieve dis
tress existing in various quarters. It
would be just as equitable, it is argued,
for the port of New York to retain all
the customs funds collected there for
expenditure on the island of Manhattan
as it would be for Havana or Santiago
or any other town In Cuba to gobble all
of the customs receipts for expenditure
within its own borders.
So far from the War Department
contemplating any curtailment of the
relief work In Cuba an order already
has been issued to the Governor Gen
eral directing him to furnish work to
every able-bodied Cuban applying for
it at a fair rate of weekly wages, meas
ured by Cuban standards. The order
suggests that the best lines of employ
ment are in sanitary work, road im
provement and municipal work of va
rious sorts.
It is intended to offer a chance for
remunerative work to all who are able
to take advantage of it and to cut off
the gratuitous distribution of rations
among those natives able to work for
what they eat. The employment con
templated will not be offered, however,
to any resident of the island who re
tains his allegiance to Spain.
A Boy Who Was Too Smart.
There's a youngster on Joy street who
hears things, remembers them and util
izes them in his own way at home.
The other night there was company
for dinner and Jimmie startled every one
when he thus tried to relieve a. brief si
lence:
"Papa you smell like a Chinese laun
dryman.
"What do you mean, you impudent
boy?" blurted out the father, both embar
rassed and angry.
"Through your rose, of course," and
Jimmy could hear laughter after he had
gone to bed under imperative orders.
Several weeks ago there was a meet
ing of charitably Inclined ladies at the
house and Jimmie entered in the midst of
their deliberattions. After listening long
enough to get the thread of the discussion,
he took a hand.
"Mamma," Jimmie interrupted, in a sad
voice, "I know a man not three blocks
from here that hasn't given his wife a
thing to eat for more than a week."
The good women went into a perfect
spasm of indignation, some of them go
ing fo far as to declare that the monster
should be lynched. But the mother was
suspicious of the demure look on Jimmies
face. "Who is this cruel man, my son?"
"Mr. Loner."
"Mr. I. oner." gasped the excited ladles,
"Why the dear old man has no wife and
never had."
When Jirninie received the slipper treat
ment an hour later he remarked that it
didn't seem safe to tell the truth.âDe

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. s.â The St. Petersburg
correspondent of the Daily Mail says:
Privy Councilor Salomon of the pris
ons administration has just returned
here from a five months' tour of the
prisons and exile colonies of the Rus
sian Government in Siberia and the
island of Saghalien, on the east ec-ast
of Asia. He has furnished me with the
chief points of his report to the Czar.
Its leading feature is M. Salomon's
conclusion that banishment is useless
and undesirable as a punishment, be
cause it produces the complete moral
degradation of the exile.
Salomon found the prisons in Western
Siberia in fair condition, with no signs
of overcrowding or dirt, but in Eastern
Siberia the conditions were quite the
opposite. He found matters still worse
in Saghalienâ prisoners badly treated,
prisons filthy and hospitals crowded
like pigsties. He dismissed two chief
directors of prisons for cruelty and

Was He BluffingP
At 4 o'clock one Friday afternoon not
long ago, as Mr. T. was busily engaged at
his desk in a downtown office, a man
walked in and inquired for Mr. 8., who
occupies a desk at the opposite side of the
same office. Mr. T. thought he recog
nized the man as an unwelcome caller.
When asked if Mr. B. was in, without
raising his eyes from the work before
him, Mr. T. answered, "No, he is not,"
whereupon the caller remarked that as ha
was not very busy he thought he would
sit down and wait.
At 5 o'clock he was still waiting.
At 5:30 still waiting.
A few minutes before 6 Mr. T. closed
his desk for the day and prepared to go
home. The caller ventured to ask if Mr.
B. was likely to return to his office again
that day. Mr. T. answered:
"No; he is in Buffalo, and will be back
next Tuesday morning."
The caller showed no anger. On tha
contrary i be smiled.
"Don't apologize," he said; "my. busi
ness was not important, and your â¢"office
has proved a pleasant lounging place.
Fact is," ho blandly added, "I suppose
I'm coming down with the smallpox, and

Cheap Cars for Smokers.
The new electric tram service which
has been established by the Liverpool
Corporation was opened the other day for
passenger traffic. The line, which is
equipped on the overhead trolley system,
is about three miles in length, running
from the center of the city to the Dingle,
one of the southern suburbs. The cars,
of German make, run in couplesâ one for
smokersâ and stop at stations about 200
yards apart, completing the journey in
twenty-five minutes. The fare is one
penny for smokers, and two-pence in tha
general cars. The traffic of the new line
was about treble that of the old horse car
scrvier, which was much more expensive.
The line has been constructed as an ex
periment to determine whether the over
head system whs suitable for the busy
streets in the center of the city before
establishing electric traction over tha
whole of the hundred miles of tram routes
within the city boundaries. â London

GOVERNOR BUDD'S. MESSAGE.
GOVERNOR BUDD'S message is so long that
comparatively few people will read it. yet it ;
has sufficient strength to support its weight
and will well repay the attentive and careful study of
all who take an intelligent interest in public attairs.
Moreover, it is a message which can be read with
more than ordinary gratification, since it records no- â 
table reforms and improvements in the conduct of the ;
affairs of the commonwealth, and suggests others
which might be wisely adopted.
The salient- feature of the message is the showing
made ot increased economy in the State government.
To achieve this the Governor points out that his
vetoes for the sessions of 1895 and 1897. inclusive,
amounted to - ... and ot this sum he says over
lour millions is a saving to the people. The record is
one which the taxpayers as well as the Governor can
regard with no little satisfaction.
On the subject of taxation generally the mess -
has much to say, and a considerable space is given to
â¢suggestions in the direction of tax reform. Under
our present system the rate of the tax levy is in the
hands of the Board of Equalization rather than in that
of the Legislature. If the Equalizers place a high
valuation upon the property of the State the tax rate
required to raise p. given amount of revenue will be '
low in comparison with the rate required to raise an
equal sum if the valuation is lowered.
During the past four years the Equalizers have al
ternately lowered and raised the assessment, and the
Governor asserts that this year certain members of
the Board of Equalization "telegraphed to Boards of
Supervisors suggesting they ask for a reduction in j
the valuation in their counties, and many counties |
were reduced."' The evil resulting from such a condi
tion of affairs is stated as follows:
"A high tax rate is injurious to any State because â¢
people abroad, seeking investment, ask the rate, and ,
do not understand the causes that have led a Board of
Equalization to play battledore and shuttlecock with
State" Values. They do not understand the combinn
tions of Equalizers. They do understand, however, !
that'the constant shrinkage of values would ordinarily
indicate a retrogadir.g instead of a progressing State. ,
and that low tax rates destroy property as a basis for
loans "
The Call has pointed out the advantages which
would result from such a change in the laws as would
require Equalizers to be chosen by the people of the
State at large instead of by districts, and the facts sub
mitted by the Governor strengthen the argument for
the suggested reform. The message, however, advo
cates a wider innovation, and proposes a complete re
modeling of our tax system. Some striking instances
. are given to show the injustice of the present system
and the extentto which personal property escapes
taxation.
; . .Another important recommendation is the creation
c: -a" Central State Board, to consist of the Governor
â¢,and two State officers, to have general charge of mak
ing contracts for State buildings and to regulate sala
ries and number of employes, etc., in State institu
tions. Such a board would enab'e many- reforms to
be carried out which are now impossible because of
the lack of a: , authority to enforce them.
Hardly any department or branch of the State
government is overlooked in the message, and wher
ever evils are noted well considered reforms are sug
gested. It is a state paper which should be thor
oughly studied by. the legislators, for many of the re
commendations made ought to be carried out at this
session.
The present Board 'of Education has {he advan
tage of being displayed against the background of the
-rascality of the old set. If fairly honest, they will
shine as mode's of virtue by contrast, and if con
scientious and thorough they will be rated as but
little lower than the angels.
. There was no necessity for a Police Commissioner
â¢ to*' say he had not read the statement of the intended
] raid on the police force in the interest of Dan Burns.
He merely exposes himself to the danger of not be
; ing believed.

GOVERNOR GAGES BOORISHNESS.
HENRY T. GAGE is now Governor of Califor
nia. The position is one exalted in station.
The incumbent has power to promote good
government, to advance economical methods, arul in
great measure to check the spoilsman. He can dis
courage corruption, overthrow abuses. He can
bring to the executive chair dignity, and be an honor
to the place which is an honor to him.
But because such rich opportunities present them
selves there doc? not follow a certainty that they will
be grasped. No assurance exists that an individual
will live measurably near to the ideal. Already it is
to be observed with regret that Governor Gage is too
small to boar well the trust imposed. A large man
regards himself as chosen to be the servant
of the people A small man swells to absurd propor
5, and fondly imagines that he buiges impress
ively. Or he can listen to the voice of the scheming
politician and think it the mandate of the party or the
commonwealth. These are errors into which Gage
seem? already to have fallen. Unless he taice steps to
extricate himself at once he will become hopelessly
! n-.ireJ.
When the editor of the Sacramento Bee sent to the
! Governor-elect for an advance copy of the inaugural
c benefit of the Associated Press Gage
: took : st, twisted it into a roll and asked if
McClatchy expected an answer. Being assured that
I he did. Gage replied. "I'll be if I give it."'
I on his heel and regarded the incident as i
â !. Yet by it he had made one active enemy and
nted all the leading papers of the State. Such
conduct was boorish, and boorishness comports ill
: with a governorship. Gage should have known that
even Presidents of the United States send out their
-iges in advance and never question but that
' faith wi'l be kept. When in his rambling speech of
eptance Gage had said lie would rather be Gov
i ernor of California than President of the nation peo- j
; pie supposed him to be indulging in figurative com
i pliments. He seems to have meant it. and to regard
self as awful and mighty. On the contrary, he is '
day - more his character is mani
â  â¢ -he marvel at his fortune grow;.
There v. it Gage would
sny anyl - ue. His paucity of ideas, and the j
ungainly lumbei - f the vehicle of speech he em
s, excited pity during the campaign. The effort
t i get the address in advance was no tribute to him, |
but a perfunctory duty toward the office into which
he. has been projected. Nevertheless, he chose to re
gard it as a favor to be sought by cringing journal- .
ists, and in declining to grant it that he had scored a ;
triun ers as want to print the address!

t ;i:^:i us , warrant, and thus the execu

plorable contingency.
THE FEDERAL BRIGADE.
THE Federal .ers who are absent from
their offices in this city in order to be present in
S ramento d tics for Dan Burns are
g themselves no credit and the national adminis
no good. They are doing harm to the party
â  nage they enjoy and are dishonoring it in
I [c whose votes gave it the
power to gr. c them â  I
In so far as any of them pretend that their presence
ndicates the preference of the Presi
they are insulting the man whose commission
they bear. The President takes no part in the elec
tion of a Senator in California, and his own
appointees deserve rebuke for placing him in a false
; â  tion.
Because these office-holders have received appoint
ts and are drawing salaries is no reason why they
should attempt to control the Senatorial choice of the
and force it to do an unclean thing. There is
not a decent man in California that does not know
that the election of Burns will inflict an injury upon
the Republican party from which it will not recover
f r years. What right, then, have these men to strike
; down the hopes which others have invested in future
: party success by an act which makes such success for
I a long time impossible?
Not only every self-respecting Republican who has
no wish for public office, but also every such Repub
lican who has ambitions that can be realized only by
future party victories, should say to these Federal
j ofrice-holdcrs that their presence in Sacramento on
' such an errand is an offense, an indecency, an affront
ito the party and an insult to the State. They should
:be ordered back to their offices to do the duty for
i -.vhich they are paid and which they neglect to engage
i in while cutting their party's throat
It is hinted that Burns has long tipped off races on
several tracks to certain of these office-holders,
in return go into hi the Senate. If this
. it is not only a reason why they should be or
dered home, but dismissed from their offices or sur
; rendered by their bondsmen. While they are paying
r racing tips the Federal
rt in this city is engaged in collecting $50,000 from
- I Welburn, who turned the Internal Rev
enue < >ffice into a mixture of racetrack, lottery agency
and assignation house.
This administration should see to it that the^e 01
--â¢:s are not repeated, and that the Federal service
is not dragged in the mire by such methods
These office-holders got enough when they got on
the payroll. Let them keep hands off the party
and attend to the duties for which they are paid.
A BOOM FOR GORMAN.
AS a result of the Wilson tariff and the Bryan
campaign for free silver the Democratic party
.en so weakened that when the next Con
â  eets there will be not a single straight Demo
crat in the Senate from the Northern States. Nor will
there be a solid Democratic representation from the
South, as the Republicans will have ten Senators from
tion. The conservative branch of the Govern
ment will be safely in the hands of Republicans, and
free trade and free silver are no longer issues of prac
tical politic?.
Under these circumstances it is natural the Demo
crat? should begin to look for a leader who is not
identified with either the free trade or the free silver
fiasco. Even among Democrats who believe in those
theories many are no longer in favor of making an
other fight for them. The Nashville American, for
example, says: "We are Democratic from headpiece
to footslug. but we believe we are sagacious enough
tn see a brick wall when it stands in our pathway."
and it adds: 'There is a chance for Democracy to
make a strong fight in 1900. but it is not by blindly
forcing leaders or issue? to the front that have been
rejected at the ballot-box."
In the general search for a new leader the atteiK
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JAyUARY 5, 1899.
tion of the Democrats is at this juncture directed
mainly toward Gorman, who has a fairly good record
on tariff and finance questions, but who, nevertheless,
stood with his party in the Bryan campaign. His
colleagues in the Senate are strongly in his favor, and
he seems to have considerable support throughout
the country.
In a recent interview published in the New York
Herald Senator Faulkner of West Virginia, after de
claring his opposition to the renomination of Bryan,
said: "I have in my mind a man whom I regard as the
ablest leader the Democratic party can boast of to
day. I do not care to mention his name, but he is
now a member of the United States Senate." It is
significant that in no quarter does there seem to be
any doubt who was meant by the statement, and
e*'ery comment on it has been a discussion of the
availability of Gorman as a Presidential candidate.
The suggestion has not been received with uni
versal approval even among those who wish a new
leader. The Nashville American, which itself favors
an abandonment of the free trade fight for the pres
ent., strangely enough objects to Gorman on the
ground that while he "is able, a good organizer, a
man of brains, he is not in accord with the general
Democratic doctrine of tariff for revenue only.' 1
The more serious objections to the suggestion,
however, are those based upon Gorman's record 2S
the political boss of Maryland. His practices there
were so corrupt as to force the better element of his
own party to revolt against him. That record would
be fatal to him as a candidate for the Presidency.
However able a leader and organizer he may be, he
is best known to the country as a machine politician,
and he is, moreover, without magnetic or other popu
lar qualities. He is undoubtedly the first choice of his
Senatorial colleagues, but the day when a clique of
Senators could nominate a President has gone by.
The Gorman boom, therefore, is perhaps much larger
now than it will be in 1900.
ONE of the most important matters of legisla
tion this winter is .- ;:.e measure for defense
of California forests against fire. When one
reflects upon the range and variety of interests de
pendent on our forests, the subject assumes an im
| pressive magnitude. The lumbering interest may be
temporary here, as it has been in Michigan, Wiscon
sin and Minnesota, or it may be made a permanent
interest by treating timber as a crop which may be
; harvested and grown. .' re and horticulture
i and mining depend on I i ervation of moisture
Iby preserving the forest shelter of the mountain
| slopes and plateaus. Without irrigation our raisin
' product and most of our orange output will be lost.
The raisin must be grown in a naturally arid region,
where the heat and dryness add sugar to the grape
and dry it to a raisin in the open air. The fruitfulness
â¢ of the vine requires in such a situation ample irriga
i tion. The whoie crop of this State depends on irri
gation, and without it we would not grow en
raisins to pay for shipping to a market. The same is
true of the orange. It must have sun and dry air and
enough moisture at the root to make up for evapora
! tion from the foliage. Without this the fruit is small
and the rind thickens. Other important field nad
i forage crops require irrigation. The mountain for
i csts are the water reservoir of the State. Destroyed
i at the rate at which they are now being consumed by
fire, that reservoir will soon disappear; the soil will
\ wash off its rock foundation, and when rain
falls or snow thaws water will come down in irre
: sistible torrents instead of going into the shaded soil
to descend slowly into its natural channels and reach
the irrigator in such volume and at such season as is
, most useful too him.
The miner depends r.pon the same resource, for
water for his steam or electric power, and for running
stamp mills, washing gravel and in every essential
process of his industry.
Finally, the climate itself, prized possession of Cali
fornia, depends materially upon the preservation of
the forests.
It is to be hoped that the two universities will add
to their colleges a college of forestry. Cornell has
: done this, and has placed at the head of it Dr. Fer
now, long at the head of the forestry division of the
Department of Agriculture at Washington. The
State of New York has acquired 320,000 acres of for
est in the Adirondacks for the purposes of this col
lege of forestry.
California has a greater wealth and a greater stake
ie her forests than all the rest of the Union combined.
If the universities found schools of forestry their
classes will be sought by young men who have a
taste for this most interesting pursuit. I: the State
provide an organization for policing the forests in the
summer season it should be required that the students
of forestry in the universities shall have the preference
in that employment. Then will be opened a way to
save the forests, to aid tliâ¬ study required and to help
the many young men who energetically work their way
through the university. At Berkeley there is a stu
dents' woodyard, run by co-operation of students
who have to pay their way as they go. They buy
wood, saw and peddle it. From such material as that
the State could enlist it? forest poiice, help students
'-. and prevent the vast and destructive summer fires.
The young men would acquire valuable practical
knowledge in botany, dendrology and geology, lines
of learning necessary in scientific forestry, and we
would have a well-equipped army of trained foresters,
sufficient in number to oversee our whole forest area,
introduce economic methods into the timber harvest,
preserve the oncoming crop and preside usefully over
the great interests of the miner, the lumberman, the
horticulturist and the agriculturist.
By this plan the forest policy of the State would be
administered .without making it a part of a political
t machine. Its continuity of policy would be unbroken
and every dollar spent in it would bring a dollar's
worth of benefit with compound interest.
It would be well if the Legislature could have the
benefit of counsel with the authorities of the univer
sities on this subject. They both have botanical and
agricultural departments and professors who are very
competent to advise. The Miners' Association, State
Board of Trade and Sierra Club have already taken
some action in the premises, and doubtless have ideas
and information that would aid to a legislative con
clusion. The organizations of fruit-growers and
dealers and the lumber interests should join with
these and see to it that at least a beginning is made
during the present session.

THANKSGIVING CHEER
AMONG SOLDIER BOYS
Down at Manila the Men From Minnesota
Feed the Favorite Sons of
California.
By Corporal F. A. Healy.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
MANILA, Dec. 3.â The coming of
transports is now of almost daily oc
currence, sometimes one sometimes two
{or three arriving in one week. They
all bring troops and the Eighth Army
Corps continues to grow in size, as well
as in grace and wisdom. Among other
bodies there have come to our hospita
ble shore the "terrible" Tennesseeans,
\\ho have gained for themselves such
fear-inspiring reputations for valorous
j deeds and desperate v.ork accomplished
during their campaign in San Fran
cisco. Their reputation has preceded
: them, and from all I hear I think it
) is safe to promise them the warmest
kind of a time as soon as they com
mence to "spread themselves." There
are a few "warm babies" in the regi
ments already here who are more than
' willing to constitute themselves a re
j ception committee and do all they can
j to demonstrate how kindly they feel
! toward the men from the South for the
; manner in which the latter requited
! Western hospitality.
Thanksgivin~ day proved a great
success. I did not see much of it my
self, as I was ordered to the hospital,
but from all accounts things were
made to go with a zip, boom, ah! Dur
ing the cooler hours r,f the day there
were athletic games ashore, boat races
afloat and a general come and have
something time everywhere. At about
3 o'clock in the afternoon our boys â or
at least those who were well enough to
do soâ became the guests at dinner of
the Minnesotans, They were enter
tained by their hosts company by corn-
In different restaurants of the
ry one had a first-class time,
and when the homeward journey cor
ned it would have been hard to de
termine by the devious trail left behind
which was the "field and staff" and
which the "rank and file." As for the
"line"â well that was so crooked that
a man had to turn around before he
could tell the way it led. The Minne
sotans are good fellows, from a good
place, and the celebration was the nat
ural outcome of the more than ordin
arily good feeling that exists between
their regiment and our own.
The honor of acknowledging this
honor done the Californians fell upon
Lieutenant Colonel Duboce, who is
n as Manila's "silver-tongued
A.iax." and gallantly did he acquit him
self of the pleasant duty.
The rick in hospital had as good a
time as their condition would permit.
Being an inmate of Ermita Hospital, I
dined there, partaking of an excellent
dinner provided by Dr. McCarthy. It
was spread under a tent, the g.:
Father McKinnon, and served on tables
loaded with delicacies from the hospita
ble Red Cross storehouse, the doors of
which were unlocked and thrown wide
open by J. O'C. Schlott.
It was a curious and rather pathetic
sight to look along the rows of tables
laden to the breaking point with every
; obtainable delicacy, and then glance
from the board to the faces lining it
wan, sunken faces, upon which the pal
' lor of sickness had overcome the bronze
: of the soldier; faces wistful and tired
: of expression, lightened by eyes which
would kindle with a momentary flash
of pleasure as they rested on the good
I things provided, only to grow dim
; again with the recollection of that
h<-me for the loss of which these same
: delicacies were offered in compensation.
However, the affair was a success,
', notwithstanding its environment.
Speeches were made by Dr. McCarthy,
Father McKinnon, Mr. Schlott and
others, who were, in turn, feebly cheer
ed by their guests. En passant, I
would like to remark a peculiar charac
teristic of the volunteer soldier. He
I cheers on all occasions and at all times,
i on the slightest provocation or without
I any provocation at all. He cheers
j when he hears a piece of good news;
j he cheers when the news is bad; he
i cheers at reveille; he cheers at retreat;
; he cheers at mess call, and he cheers
; to the very echo the speeches of his
\ superiors, which are. as a rule, on a
i par with the food. Tes, the American
â  volunteer soldier has a penchant for
; cheering, which is surpassed by noth
ing I know of. unless It be the passion
possessed by the volunteer officer' to
; make poor speeches at every appropri
! ate apportunity.
The rainy season is supposed *-> be
' over, but still it rains about three
fourths of the time, which, though un
pleasant as it makes traveling:
: and moving about out of doors
is really a blessing in disguise, as it
! makes parades (the abomination of the
i enlisted man), an impossiblity. Con
-1 eequemly. the boys spend most of their
time within the shelter of their bar
racks, discussing rumors which come
j floating down the line with a rapidity
I and diversity which would make one's
1 head swim. Who gives them birth,
whence they originate none can say.'
They always have been, they are. and.
as long as the army exists", they w'ili

The latest one which comes to me as
I write is that we are soon to leave Ma
nila for Honolulu to take the place of
the New York regiment, which wil!
then be ordered here. Of course there
is not the slightest truth in this report,
but if it were so it would be an excel
lent arrangement. The New Yorkers
are very anxious to get here; the Cali
fornia boys are "crazy" to get ho:
as near there as possible. Transports
have to come and go. Why not make
the change and make every one h

characterized as "a. certain exalt-? i per

he is correctly quoted, that the boys of
the First California were anxious to
stay here as long as the Government
desired their services. The boys are
anxious to do nothing of the kind. They
want. almost to a man, to get home
just as soon as they can be taken there.
Their work has been accomplished and
they object to being used a.^ a stopping
stone to ambition, be that am
ever so worthy. Did all the i
spondents, whether professional or
otherwise, look through tie ranks once
in a while instead of over th-:-m they
would not only get a more correct idea
of how the men feel concerning vari
ous matters, but would discover much
food better fitted for reflection than for
digestion.
General King has arrived, hut as he
is ill with the ordinary climatic com
plaints Colonel Smith continues to
command the brigade and Lieutenant
Colonel Duboce the regiment. The
only addition to the existing conditions
of garrison life is the nightly concert
on the Lunetta. There is a bandstand
there and every evening a concert Is
given by one of the different regimental
bands. The Oalifornians play on
"Wednesday evenings.
Since my last letter -we have lost an
other man â Frank Temple, a private of
Company I, who died a day or two ago
from smallpox. Again death, following
the rule he has observed in almost
every case, picked from the best among
us, and in taking Temple took a fel
low whose place in the ranks, aa
as in the hearts of his comrades, it
will be hard to fill.
The sick list is now at the low water
mark. In both divisional and conva
pt hospitals we have but ninety
one man, the smallest sick list since
our entrance inter Manila.
Dr. O'Brien is Boon to leave for home
in charge of the sick, who will go on

TWAS A SMART DOG.
Had Been Trained to Bark "When the
Roundsman Came.
As the police st rgea.ru was leaning: ovr
the railing in front of his desk the
night a cirty yellow dog sneaked in the
open doorway, locked quickly- around in
a timid way and then approached
tat ing! y the doorman.
The doorman said "Get out!" and the
dog got out. That led the sergeant into
a story.
"You don't know what that cur was
here for. do you? Well, he's lookin" for
a cop, and I know iust what cop, too. The
dog expected to find the cop on p^ â 
nitrht, as usual, but the policeman, . re
ported sick at 10 and -went he:
"Any one would think it strange, but
it's a fact that lots of policemen In s
city have curs like that as companion =
on" their night patrol. Perhaps that is
why they call the last tour the 'dog
watch.'
"Ton s^e. the ordinary copper p^'s

makes friends the copper fines it a- re

dogâ for it's usually a dogâ at the same
place the next nic
"That's all right so far as It froes, but if
the copper is lazy or inclined to take
chances in 'beating* his roundsman by
taking a nap or a drink, the d<->g's likely
to be as much of a nuisance as he is com
pany. You see the dog stands outside the
saloon door ever:.- time, and if the rounds
man sees the dog he usually sees the cop
per a little later, and then trouble is in
tor some one.

and, as Murphy used to take chances like
the rest of them, we thought the d^g 1
would become a nuisance, but he' didn't,
for Murphy got the cur trained so he'd
bark every time the roundsmanâ Jimmy
McGee â came around the corner. That
dog could spot McGee three blocks away,
and ho saved Murphy's skin fifty time's.
Murphy named him 'Harry 8.,' after him
self.
"McGee got onto the game. pretty quick,
but he never ca:ght Murphy, and that
worried him to death, for McGee was a
perfect Tartar. Finally McGee caught the
dog on a pier one night, and he clubbed
the pup over the head and threw hir
the river. Murphy on hearing this fished
the doe out of the river and buried him.

AGREED TO BE GOOD.
Rare Document Is Produced in the
Lee Divorce Case.
Hebecca Lee, who lives at 1015 Market
street, as plaintiff in an action for divorce ' .
recently instituted against her husband,
J. W. Lee, had her innings before Judge
Hunt yesterday. Mrs. Lee alleges that
for some time past her husband has been
in the habit of treating her in an inhu
man manner, and for these reasons she
asks that the marital knot be severed
and that she be given all the community
property in which her husband is inter
ested, together -with suitable alimony.
Lee denied her allegations of cruelty and
simply states that at the time he was
forced to slap his wife because she would I
remain away from home all day and on i
her return refuse to tell him where she !
had been.
Mrs. Lee was first called upon to tes
tify in her own behalf, and she Bet forth
many specific acts of cruelty of which
she was the victim. In support of her
' contention that she had been abused she
'produced a document showing that at
! one time her husband had seen himself
! as others saw him, repented in conse
i Quence and bound himself to be good .in
â  an odd document, of which the following
I is a copy:
SAX FRANCISCO, July 12. 1832.
J. W. I,ee, party oÂ£ the ttrst part, and Re
! becca Lee, party of the second part, husband
and wttt .
i I John W. J>e, do solemnly promise to keep
j sacred and inviolate the following articles
herein named, to wit:
Firstâ To love, cherish, protect and provide
' for through life my wife, Rebecca Lee. and at
I my death, should I die first, to leave the said
I Rebecca Lee, my wife, all my personal effects
' and belongings, together T<.-it.h my lodge cer
j tincate in the A. O. U. W.
I Secondâ Never by word, deed or act on my
i part to Insult or abuse her.
Thirdâ To provide for her a good, comfort
: able home, support and shelter her to the best
i of my ability.
I Fourthâ To share equally all my Income with
â  her.
j Fifthâ That we shall always live together as
! husband and wife by ourselves, my two daugh
â  ters, known as Nellie L?<: and Clara Lee. to
j live separately and apart from us, and that
they shall in no way interfere between us In
I the future.
i Sixthâ To all of which articles above men
tioned I faithfully promise to keep sacred and
: as long us I live to not violate one or any of
them, and I call upon God on high to witness
all of the above articles herein mentioned.
(Signed.) JNO. W. LEE.
Witnesses: SAM B. SHELDON. K. H.
ELAIN.
After Mrs. I><Â» had left the stand J. P.
McKenna was called and testified that on
at least one occasion he had held Lee in his
i brawny arms to prevent him from heat
â  ing his wife. He recited other Incidents
of cruelty on the part of Lee and then re
; tired. To-day Lee will have a chance to
: disprove the allegations of his wife, if
he can, and for that purpose has sum-
I moned a number of witnesses to testify
I that his wife's passion for gambling in
I stocks broke up their once happy home.
THE GALLAGHER INQUEST.

James Gallagher, who was shot and
killed in Sullivan's saloon at 113 O'Farrell
street last Saturday night. All the wit
nesses were examined, but all who were

THE SAN FBAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 5, 1890.
THE SPARTAN ON HER WAY TO SEA.
After leaving Clallam Bay, and while the men were making fast the port anchor, Second Mate John Wielan
of the Spartan lost his balance and fell overboard. The steel hawser could neither be cut nor cast off, and the
attention of the crew of the tug could not be attracted by signaling, so the ship went on to sea ana Wielan had
to be left to his fate.

the weather had moderated outside the
tug came alongside, the Spartan's anchor
â¢was tripped and another start made for
San Francisco.
When the tup and her tow were well
out Into the Straits of Fuca the fatality
occurred. Second Mate John "VVielan and
some of the crew were on the forecastle
head making fast the port anchor. By
some mischance Wielan lost his footing
and fell overboard. It was a beautiful
moonlight night at the time and the sea
was as smooth as glass. The men could
soe the mate drifting astern and the cry
of "man overboard" was raised. The tug
was taking the Spartan through the wa
ter at the rate of eight knots an hour,
and the sailors tried in vain to throw the
towing line off. They could do nothing
with the steel hawser, however. Then
thfy got axes and tried to cut the rope,
but failed again. Lights were flashed at
the tug, horns tooted, danger signals giv
en, but the captain of thÂ» steamer neither
heard nor saw any of them, or if he did
paid no attention, and so the man strug
gling in the water was left to his fate.
The Spartan was towed to sea and cast
off. The tug returned to Port Townsend
with those aboard still in ignorance of
what had happened. Wielan was well
known on the coast, as he had been in
the Puget Sound trade for years.
The ship Wachusett arrived from the
Sound yesterday after a long and tem
pestuous voyage. To add to the horrors
of the trip she sprang a lf-ak, and for ten
Jays the men were at thÂ« pump:- more
s all the rim- 1 . It was on Christmas
â¢ .... when the ship was sixteen miles
southwest of Flattery, that the first gale
came up. It blew with hurricant- fnrce
from the southeast, and on Christ
mas day the Wachusett sprang a
leak and soon the water was making
headway at the rate of six inches an
hour. AH day long. Instead of enjoying
Christmas fare, the crow battled with
the storm and labored at the pumps. The
next day the gale died down a little, but
It soon sprang up acain, and for ten days
it was a continual nght for life. The ship
was well found throughout and thor
oughly stanch or she would never have
stood "the battering she got. As it is she
will have to go on the drydock and re
ceive a thorough overhauling before she
can go to sea again.
Vessels arriving one after the other
with tales of storm and disaster have
raised fears for the safety of the steam
schooners Ruth, Coquille River, Grace
Dollar and Fulton. They are all long
overdue, but probably were driven north
by the southeaster. The Ruth and Bonita
left Coos Bay in company and the Bonita
got in last Tuesday after a seventy-?ix
hour tussle with the storm. The Ruth
had the schooner Luella in tow, and the
chances are that both of them are hove
i he Luella is to be a steam schooner,
and is on her way here to have her en
gines put in.
The Coquille River was due here from
Tillamook and the Grace Dollar from
Grays Harbor last Monday, while the
Fulton left here for Coos Bay on Decem
ber 29. While the Coquille River and
Grace Dollar may have been hove to all
through the storm the chances are that
the Fulton has been driven past her des
tination and will have to fight her way
back.
Little Royal Mateo Beeman, the boy
whose mother braved the terrors of a
norther in order to bring him from the
Farallones to a doctor, died last Tuesday.
It will be remembered that the boat in
which the mother and her companions at
tempted the dangerous trip was nearly
swamped and all of them would have
been drowned had not the pilot boat
America gone to their assistance. Cap
t iin Jordan not only picked them up but
brought the party to the city. The best
medical care could do little Royal no
good, ho he passed away in his mother's
arms.
Vessels for the spring rush to th* Klon
dike are now being eagerly snuerht for,
and freights are likely to advance in con
sequence. Parties are now negotiating

Fined for Contempt.
Tnited States Circuit Court Judge Mor
row yesterday concluded the contempt
proceedings in the case of the Sanitary
Reduction Works of San Francisco
against the California Reduction Com
pany, finding Behrend Joost, President of
the California Reduction Company, guilty
of contempt and fining him $250, with the
alternative of sixty days in jail, and Giu
seppe Figoni, an employe, -'$50, or thirty
days' imprisonment.
By a contract made with the Board of
Supervisors, the Sanitary Reduction
Works was given the monopoly of dispos
ing of all garbage within the city and
county of San Francisco. The defendant
was a competing company, and was there
fore enjoined- by the courts from trans
acting its business. The defendants vio
lated the injunction and were summoned
to appear for contempt.
PUGILISM THIS MONTH.
McConnell and Neil Readyâ Jeffries
and Kennedy Training.
Frank McConnell and Al Neil are train
ing like beavers for their 20-round bout
at Woodward's Pavilion on January 17.
The welter-weights have signed to light
at 148 pounds. McConnell realizes that to
lose this coming fight will mean to him
a permanent retirement from the ring,
and consequently he is taking the best
care of himself. Neil is by no means
easy game and will have several backers
who will back him heavily to whip Mc-
Connell on the night of the mill.
"Cocker " Tweedle and Tye of Oakland
should "put up" a rattling good exhibi
tion. Tweedie will doubtless be a favor
ite with the gamblers, yet Tye may give
him as warm a reception as he received
from Lawlor at the Olympic club. They
will contest fifteen rounds or more at 135
pounds. "Jockey" Maynard and Willy
Cole will box ten rounds- at 116 pounds.
All three contests should be interesting.
as the pugilists are well matched. The
entertainment will commence with the
"feathers." after which will come the
"lights," and then the "welters."
The big heavy-weight contest between
Jeffries and Kennedy will be held under
the auspice? the National Club on the
evening of the 27th inst. Jeffries is very
confident of whipping Kennedy easily, but
the Excelsior Club thinks differently.
The San Francisco Athletic Club will
entertain its members on the evening of
W. H. METSON, the New Park Commissioner.
January 12. The programme of fistic
events is: Young McDonald of the San
Francisco Athletic Club and Eddy Al
ford, late of New York, six rounds, for
the bantam-weight championship of this
State; A. (Jrunne-ld of the San Francis
cos and "Kid" Johnson of the Manhattan
Athletic Club, six rounds, at 123 pounds;
Jack Dean and Joe Long, six rounds; and
Â»lus Koster and J. J. Castro of the Wat
sonville Athletic Club, six rounds.
The club has received its incorporation
papers and is now established on a basis
with the following officers: President, D.
V. Denehy; vice president, John O^Keefe;
treasurer, A. Greggains; secretary. B. M.
Broad well; captain, Frank Scheuler; di
rectorsâWilliam Quinn, H. Gardner. J.

TWO WEDDINGS
IN A WEEK
Members of the Hicks-
Judd Company Surprise
Their Friends.
The Hicks-Judd Company has added
two happy men to the list of benedicts
during the past week.
X. A. Judd, president of the company,
was married in Reno on Monday to Mrs.
E. A. Kelly, the couple having left here
last Saturday night.
The other wedding was that of Charles
K. Rosenberg, secretary and treasurer of
the company, and Miss Lucy 11. Munson,
bookkeeper of the concern, who were
married in this city Saturday evening.
The wedding took place at the home of
the bride's parents, 114 Broderick street.
Bishop Mor<>land officiating. Miss M.
Rosenberg, sister of the groom, acted as
bridesmaid and W. K. Munson, brother of
the bride, was best man. A limited num
ber of relatives and friends witnessed the
ceremony, and Sunday Mr. and Mrs.
Rosenberg left for Del Monte on their
honeymoon trip.
Mr. Rosenberg is well known in busings
circles, and has a large number of friends.
His bride has been in the employ of the
Hicks-Judd Company for a number of
years, and is highly esteemed by her em
ployers and associates.
FISHING FOR STEELHEADS.
Anglers Who Went to Russian River
Were Sadly Disappointed.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Cross and
Davis have just returned from Russian
River/where they arrested an Italian fish
erman for violating the fish law by using
a set net across the river. His
examination will be held in Santa Rosa
to-day. Last week the railroad people
broke open the bar across the river near
the mouth so that the steelhead salmon
could get into the waters above. It was
believed that the run of rish would be
large and the deputies were on hand to
prevent illegal fishing. The arrest was
made early in the morning, when thÂ«
accused thought lio one wan around.
Knowing that the bar would be opened
a large number of well known hook and
line fishers went up from the city, but.
they wore not rewarded for their trouble.
For some time after the break was made
tli" water was stagnant and but few fish
entered. Since then the rains have raised
the stream so that the water is too high
for good fishing.
Money in the Treasury.
The counting of the money in the vaults
of the City Treasurer was completed
shortly after 6 o'clock last night after sev
eral days' labor. It was found that the.
city has on hand $1,651,019 20, municipal
funds. There is also $300,000 on special
deposit awaiting the report of the State
Controller as to the amount to be re
tained here for school purposes. The for
ma) transfer of office from Christian Reis
to I. J. Truman has been made and the
office will be open for business at 9 o'clock
this morning. The office has been be
sieged for some days by people having
December warrants.
Advances made on furniture and pianoe. with
or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.
THE SAX FR Ay CISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 5, 1899.
METSON TO HELP
RUN THE CITY'S
PLAYGROUND
Has Been Made a Park
Commissioner.
BUDD'S FAREWELL FAVORS
XIRKPATRICK AND HENSHAW
FOR YOSEMITK
Appointments That Find Favor in
the Eyes of the Friends
of All Three
Hen.
One of Governor Budd's last official acts
.was the appointment of two Park Com
missioners â one to beautify Golden Gate
Park of this city and the other to pre
serve nature at Yosemite. It has been
generally surmised for some time that
Budd has had the matter of these ap
pointments sifted down, but few who
were not on the Inner circle of his affairs
guessed the plums would fall where they
did. W. H. Metson received the appoint
ment for Golden Gate and Colonel John
C. Kirkpatrlck for Yosemite. The an-
nouncements were made to-day and
caused a little consternation among tho
friends of Kirkpatrk-k.
For some time the colonel has been con
sidered to be the favorite of the ex-Gov
ernor, and numerous friends put in a
word at every avenue that they might
furthor his chance. He was a member of
the Governor's staff, and not only did Re
publicans plead for his appointment, but
many leading and influential Democrats
Interceded in his behalf. Two points ad
vanced in his favor were that he is so
connected in San rancisco as to do the
park a great deal of good, and that for a
number of years he has manifested vast
interest in the public playground. The
kind words thus spoken impressed Budd
to such an extent that about one week
ago he persona^" informed Kirkpatrlck
that he should bestow the honor upon
him. This was assumed to be final, and
for a time some people breathed easy.
It happened, however, that this morn
ing at an early hour it was definitely
learned that Budd had decided to change
his mind, and this became a certainty
when, a couple of hours later, the Gov
ernor telegraphed to this city requesting
the colonel to release him from his pledge.
He gave as a reason that the Democratic
Senators and Assemblymen had protested
strongly against the appointment of a
Republican and demanded that a Demo
crat fill the bill. The Governor had made
his pledge in good faith, but the storm of
protest was too strong for him to bear.
When It was announced that Willam H.
WILL HENSHAW, New Yosemile Valley Commissioner,
Metson was Budd's choice the selection
suited everybody, and after the little
wave of surprise had shuffled Its way
along even the frienus of Kirkpatrick ex
pressed themselves as satisfied.
Metson is a leading attorney, being an
associate of the firm of Reddy, Campbell
& Metson. For six years he has been in
terested in the seed business and has
I made the subject of horticulture a life
long study. He ha 3 the largest acreage of
I sweetpeas on the coast. His beds of car-
I nations are superb, and are the result of
I his long experience and attention. He also
has the distinction of possessing the
largest patch of asparagus in the State of
California. His garden and vegetable
seeds have been distributed broadcast
over the land, and he Is considered an
expert on fruit trees.
Metson succeeds Irving M. Scott. He In
tends to improve the beauty spot of San
Francisco and will make every necessary
improvement within the limit of the park
funds.
Late yesterday afternoon the Governor
found a place for Colonel Kilpatrick, and
named him as the Commissioner for Yo
semite. The colonel knows every foot of
the ground like a book, and will manifest
the greatest Interest in affairs which per
tain to the State reservation. The last
but not least honor which the passing
Governor could bestow fell upon Will
Henshaw, a brother of Judge Henshaw,
who was also made a Yosemite Park
Commissioner.
TO PROTECT GAME AND FISH.
A Meeting of Sportsmen Will Be
Held at the Olympic Gun Club
on Monday.
A convention of sportsmen Interested In
the protection of same birds and animals
will be held in the rooms of the Olympic
Gun Club next Monday evening. It Is
expected that every gun club in the State
will be represented by one or more dele
gates. The object of the meeting is to
discuss the game question and the game
laws, and to submit to the Legislature
whatever changes and additions to the
present game laws the body in session
may deem advisable.
Owing to the rapid decrease of quail In
the past few years a short open season
will doubtless be recommended. The Eng
lish snipe will also find supporters at the
meeting, as It is proposed to include It
in the game law with other game birds.
Something may be done regarding the
limiting of game bags, but this idea will
not meet with general approval, as it
would be next to an impossibility for thÂ»
Fish and Game Commissioners to keep
an eye on the hunting coats of every
hunter who goes into the field or marsh
during the game shooting season.
Something should be done to protect the
wild ducks that rest on the bay from
fishermen who make a practice of netting
tho aquatic birds that dive for their food.
Thomas Casey, a well-known sports,
man. is slowly convalescing. His pet
English setter dog, "Dot," died last Sun
dny. and Thomas has been ill since then.
While out shooting Sunday Charles Os
wlll shot a enrrier pigeon which had on
one of its legs a brass ring. The ring
was stamped E. 2, B. W. C. K.
WOULD BE NO BURDEN
UPON HIS FAMILY
JOSEPH WALKER ENDS HIS LIFE
OF TROUBLE.
Found Hanging in a Shed in the
Rear of His Resi
dence.
Sick, poverty-stricken, melancholy with
the sight of the pleading white face of
an overworked and hungry wife, Joseph
W. Walker, ship carpenter, put an end to
his 73 years of life by hanging himself
early yesterday morning from a shed in
the rear of his residence, 1552 Howard
street. The dead body was discovered at
6 o'clock In the morning by his wife and
his daughter Isabella. It was removed
to the Morgue. An inquest will be held
at 9 o'clock this morning by Coroner Hill.
On his person were found the following
notes, the first of which was in ink. It
runs as follows:
SAX FRANCISCO, December 2S, 1898.
To the Coroner of the City of San Francisco â
Pir: I don't think It is necessary to hold any
Inquest on me. The fact Is I was watching
on the tea wall to last month and I caught a
severe cold there. Through It I have a com
pialnt that I am afraid I shall not easily get
rid of. I am in much pain all the time. Three
weeks gene already and I am tired out. I
have written this so that no person shall think
that others have put me away. If I cannot
work I shall only be a burden on my family,
and that I don't Intend to be; so I think this
la best. J. W. WALKER.
In pencil nnd written at later dates
were the following notes:
I don't wish one dollar to be expended on mj
funeral more than is necessary, for It will dc
me no good, and my wife has no money. A
little laudanum did th>- w..rk.
January 4 la. m.â Three doses of laudanum
had no effect, bo I had to hang myself In the
cold yard. -T- W. WALKER.
Came here early In the spring of 1549, mate

the ground of willful desertion.
CHARLES A. BEELER
IS STILL AT LARGE
NO CLEW TO THE ABSCONDING
WELLS-FARGO CLERK.
It Was Rumored That He Had Sailed
for Mexico on the Ship
Reaper.
Charles A. Beeler, the "Wells-Fargo de
livery clerk who absconded from San An
tonio, Texas, with $50,000 belonging to the
Southern Pacific Company, notwithstand
ing every trap that has been laid by the
detectives to capture him, is still at large.
About six hours after the ship Reaper
left the dock yesterday morning informa
tion was given to the Wells-Fargo office
in this city that Beeler had taken pas
sage aboard her and was on his way to
Mexico. One of the employes of the com
pany was immediately detailed to hire a
tugboat and make an effort to overhaul
the vessel. Chief Lees assigned Officers
Ellis and Ferguson of the Harbor Police
to accompany him and bring Beeler back
to the city in case he was found on the
vessel.
After several hours of fruitless pursuU
the ship was finally sighted about twenty
miles south of the Farallon Islands.
Upon finally overtaking it the tug was
brought alongside and the officers were
allowed to go aboard her. Every inch of
the vessel was searched, but no trace of
the absconding clerk was found. Upon
being convinced that Beeler was not on
board, the agent of the company and the
two officers returned to the city.
Beeler had been employed by the Wells-
Fargo Company for nine years prior to
the date of the robbery. On the day the
money was stolen he was engaged in de
livering cash that had been intrusted to
his employers. Among the largest sums
that were given him for delivery was
$50,000, which he was instructed to carry
to the Southern Pacific Railroad office in
San Antonio. Several hours after the
money had been turned over to him his
horse and wagon, which he used for the
purpose of delivering the various money
orders, was found about five miles west
of San Antonio. Not the slightest trace of
the clerk could be found. It was reported
that he had been robbed and murdered,
but this was denied as he was seen alive
the day after the robbery. The presump
tion is that he was then making his way
toward Mexico, but knowing that he was
closely pursued he altered his course, se
lecting this city ;ls the best means of get
ting out of the country.
It was while acting under this theory
that the rumor was circulated that he had
taken passage on board the Reaper for
Mexico.
TO BE MUSTERED OUT.
Eighth California and Bateries B and
C, California Artillery.
The officers and men of the Eighth Cali
fornia Regiment will soon be simply plain
citizens. Major General Merriam will to
day issue orders that will cause the men
of the Eighth to doff the blue and put on
the garb of the citizen. Orders were re
ceived at department headquarters yes
terday for the immediate mustering out
of the Eighth Regiment and Batteries B
and C of the California Heavy Artillery.
Captain Pratt of the Third Artillery, who
mustered out the Seventh Regiment, will
I:i all probability muster out the Eighth
and the two batteries. One of the bat
teries is at Angel Island and the other is
at present at Fort Canby. Battery B is
doing garrison duty at the former station
and Battery C at the latter.
General Merriam said yesterday that he
could not state whether the companies of
the Eighth Kegiment now at Vancouver
Barracks and Benicla would be brought
to the Presidio for tho purpose of being
mustered out, but that in all probability
tiny would be ordered here. The Twen
tieth Regiment, United States Infantry,
which has been ordered to the Philip
pines, will arrive here about the last of
next week. General Merriam also stated
that Major General Shafter would arrive
here about next Tuesday to assume com
mand of the department and that he
would leave on the 15th inst. to resume hia
old command of the Department of Colo
rado. The Twentieth Regiment on its
arrival here will go into camp at the Pre
sidio, and will probably be hero for sev
eral weeks before leaving for the Philip
pines.

Postal Clerks for Iloilo.
The Postoffice Department has appoint
ed George H. Wheeler, William R. Jones
and Joseph A^ Fealy for duty in the
Philippines, an "increase in the Postoffice
force being deemed necessary by reason
of the contemplated occupation of Iloilo
by the United States. The city of Iloilo
contains a population of 303,000 and is the
next city to Manila in importance.
The new appointees will leave on the
next transport that sails from this port.
The Iliolo postofflce will be a branch of
the San Francisco Postoffice.
Asked to Be Dissolved.
The Hale and Norcross Silver Mining
Company has petitioned the Supreme
Court through its board of directorsâ M.
W. Fox, Edward Barry, A. W. Moore, G.
C. Sneider, W. J. Dale, Frank Mahon and
George P. Thurstonâ for dissolution. Tho
company â was originally incorporated
March 19, IS6I. A new company, incor
porated a few days ago, as the Hale and
Norcross Mining Company takes the place
of the old company.
THE WORLD'S THEATERS.
Their Comparative Size, Earnings
and Income â Fires.
The greatest theater proprietor in the
â world is the Czar of Russia. No theat
rical manager pays so much money for
the privilege of owning places of
amusement. He owns no fewer than
seven big theaters in St. Petersburg
and Moscow. Next to the Czar the
largest theatrical patron in the world
is Emperor William, who assists two
theaters at Berlin and three in the
provinces, which together cost him
about Â£150,000 per annum.
These statements are made on the
authority of Edwin O. Sachs, who. with
a corps of assistants, has spent much
of the past eight years in collecting
data. He classifies the theaters of Eu
rope Into three groups â court theaters,
national and government theaters,
municipal theaters and subscription
theaters with or without subsidy. Of
these the private theater is. of course,
the only one conducted purely on a
business and speculative basis. Of
these, England is essentially the home,
for here there is as yet no form of
subsidy whatever.
Mr. Sachs has devoted considerable
time to securing diagrams of all the
principal theaters of the world, and
these diagrams give an excellent idea
of the comparative size of the latest
European places of amusement. With
in the National Opera House. Paris.
DOyly Carte's Theater and the Shakes
peare Memorial Theater could be cozily
stowe daway on the stage and audi
torium, and there would be ample room
for the Court Theater, Sloane Sauare.
In the grand staircase, and probably
the Duke of York's into the principal
foyer.
The theater maintaining the largest
permanent staff in Europe is the Vi
enna Opera House, where there are 756
persons in permanent employ, of whom
300 are performers. The Emperor of
Austria gives the two court theaters
a*t Vienna about Â£50,000 per annum.
The French Government contributes
the same amount to four Paris the
aters.
The most wonderful example of local
subsidizing of theaters is probably that
at Worms, in South Germany. At a
time when this was only a town of
23,000 inhabitants. Â£12,000 per annum
was raised by voluntary contributions,
the District Council subscribed Â£5000.
and the Municipal Savings Bank
loaned Â£7500 at a nominal rate of in
terest. The balance of the Â£25,000 was
made up at the bazaars, etc. The con
tributions thus amounted to over Â£1
per head.
On the subject of seating capacity
and cost of construction of the great
theaters of Europe, Mr. Sachs gives
some wonderful tables. The groat
Paris Opera House holds an audience
of 2166, and cost Â£1,500,000.
The new theater at Wolverhanvoton

On the subject of theater fires. Mr.
Sachs records no fewer than 1100 catas
trophes between 1797 and 1897. The
statistics show that the outbreak gen
erally occurs on the stage; that nearly
half take place during- the night after
the performance, while only about a
seventh of the number nappen while
the audience is in the building.
January is the heaviest month fur
fires in the playhouse. Their number is
on the increase, for there were 360 in
this decade, as compared with 309 of
the previous decade, but the number
of theaters is, of course, rapidly grow
ing.
London heads the list of theater fires
with thirty-five in twenty-seven build
ings, but the loss of life has been nom
inal. New York has had forty-one fires;
Paris thirty-one.â London Mail.
A CONTRACT JOB.
How the Creek Was Quickly Turned
Into a Little Hollow Near By.
"I was only ten years old when I se
cured my first contract," said the well
known contractor, who was in a talka
tive mood.
"My father was living on a farm at
the time, and as winter drew nigh he
conceived the plan of turning the little
creek that ran through the farm into
a hollow near by, thus forming a pond
from which to cut ice during the win
ter.
"My father figured up the cost, and
finding that it amounted to more than
he had thought it would, was about to
give it up, when I looked the situation
over, and told him that I would take the
contract for $10. He laughed and told
me to go ahead, not dreaming for an
instant that I would have ambition
enough to begin on the work, as up to
that time I had not shown a liking for
hard labor.
"I called the boys of the neighborhood
together and placed the situation before
them. The nearest pond was a matter
of ten miles away, and even a boy with
a pair of brand-new skates did not
thrill at the prospect of walking that
far for a skate. I showed them how,
with a little work, we could have a
place to skate right at home. They fell
in with the idea, and we went to work
to carry out the plan.
"We were over a month working at
it; that is, the other boys were while I
stood around and bossed the job.
"I was proud of the work when It was
finished, and I think my father was,
too, although he couldn't see for the life
of him how I managed to secure so
much helf> for nothing.
"With the first heavy freeze there
was a rush for the pond by the bovg
that was only equaled by the rush away
from it when father discovered them
there and started after them with a
horsewhip.
"He said that he wasn't goin' to have
'a lot of fine ice split by a pack of
pesky boys skatin' on it.'
"I think the incident had a certain in
fluence upon my choice of a profession,
as it taught m^ that there was money
in contracting."â Detroit Free Press.
No Room for Doubt.
"Do you doubt my word?" exclaimed
Mrs. Wiggins. - .
They were occupying "Â»mrtments in a
modern flat.
"No," replied her husband quietly:
"there isn't any room here for doubt."

TWINS MURDERED BY LAW.
According to African Superstition
Their Birth Is Proof of Witchcraft.
Mi! - .â¢' tii- United Presbyter
ian Mission at < >ld Calabar was a pas
n the Eide Dempster liner Oron,
h left Liverpool recently, and had
with her f'.ur black children whose
eveaj -i painful part of West
can history. Miss Slessor has now
<r twenty-two years in Old
The children are aged, re
flve and Bixteen
c of twins ap
<!if\ in accord
.â¢. .tli a superstitious custom pre
â¢;g in the Nicer Coasi Protectorate.
In" the course of an interview Miss
â ^lessor said that all twins born were,
according to the native laws, to be put
immediately to death, and it is only
those who have been rescued by the
missionaries und placed beyond the
roach of the native power who have
so far escaped. The children in the
<>rÂ«>n were four of these. Altogether
Miss SlcsKor has herself saved the lives
of fifty-one twins.
When the twins are born they are at
once taken from the mother, and. if no
one intercedes they are taken by the
feet, ar.it head,' and have their backs
broken across a native woman's knee,
In the me way as one would break a
stick. The bodies are then placed in
an earthenware receptacle and taken
t'j the bush, where they are devoured
by the flies, insects or animals. Some
times the little victims are put in these
receptacles alive, and are then eaten
alive in the same way. The mother bo
comes an outcast. If she does not at
once take her own life she has to flee to
the' bush. If Bhe ventures near the
town or village she must see that she
does not remain in the path when any
other native is coming. Her presence,
according to their superstition, would
defile the place for others. She must
not drink from the same spring, must
"not touch anything even belonging to
her- own relatives, and there is little
cause for wonder that she takes away
hfr life, which has become a living
death.
Miss Slessor is accompanied on the
'iron by Miss Mclntosh, and together
they are going to establish a home for
wins. The natives' BU
tltlon is that the birth of twins is
the result of witchcraft and deviltry.
Formerly the mother, as well as the
children, was put to death. The inter
vention of the- white missionaries and
traders has saved hr-r life. Miss Sles

SOME SWEAR-OFF STORIES.
The Moral of Which Is That While
Many Swear Off, but Few Stick.
"I once swore off smoking," said the
clubman. "That was when 1 was young
and did not know myself. I swore off
with a friend, and the penalty was a
suit of clothes to cost $80. The condi
tion was that we were not to smoke in
town. When traveling or hunting or
fishing â out of town, In fact â we would
be allowed to smoke. The scheme
worked well for some time; then I be
gan to want to smoke. I battled with
desire for several weeks, each day of
the period becoming a harder trial than
the preceding. At last, when the long-
Ing became too great I went to see my
partner in misery to tell him that we
had better call the contract off, as I
could not stand it. He was not at home.
He had gone out of town a week before
ar.J would be absent another week.
Then I broke down. The thought of
the party of the second part smoking
himself blue in the face while I suffered
was unbearable. So, with the fine of
$80 staring me in the face, I bought a
and smoked it. It was worth $80,
I thought Hut T did not die for a lamb
only; I smoked a vast quantity of
cigars before he came home. Then 1
went to him and told him to go order
the suit, that I had broken the con
tract. He smiled quietly, as if to him
self, and then said: 'All right, old fel
low; but do not be disturbed about the
suit. I kept the contract just three
flays.' "'
Another man said: "There were two
men in this town who swore off, the
breaker Of the contract to pay th>>
other for a ten-dollar hat. Finally
one of them weakened, saying; to him
self ho did not mind giving >10 for a
smoke. While he meditated over the
matter, however, he thought out a
scheme to save himself on the hat. He
went to the hatter's and bought a ten
do! lar hat and had it charged to the
other fellow. Then he called on the
other fellow, and, pointing to the hat,
said: "See that hat, old boy? It is one
1 have Just had charged to you on that
swr-ar-off contract.' The other fellow
cried out: "How in the dickens did
you find out I had been smoking?'
r mind.' said the other. 'A little
bird told me.' "
"Well, 1 swore off," said another club
man, "and to make the matter memor
able 1 handed a dozen fine Havana
cigars to a friend, telling him to smoke
th-mi, as I had sworn off. I was like
the man who found the first day pretty
bad, the second horrible, and the third
no trouble at all, because he began
again to smoke. About the third day
my resolution died out, and then I
thought of the fine Havanas. I met my
friend. Where are those twelve cigars
I loaned you'. 1 ' I asked. "Here," he said,
1 knew you would want them again."
And he took one for deposit charges.
I smoked the rest."
'I swore "ff once." said another club
man, "and it was just as easy as any
thing you ever heard of. I did it by
logic. 1 found 1 was smoking one cigar
after another and never getting enough,
so I said to myself that if I had to de
â  myself at some time 1 might as
well begin with the first as with the
ith cigar. Thus I convinced my
self I would have no greater difficulty
than in refusing the steenth cigar, and
such proved to be the case. I had not
th" slightest longing for tobacco after
I had made up my mind that I hud
quit. I kept a box of cigars on the
mantel, for I said I mie-ht want to
smoke, and I did not intend to treat
mj self as one in whom 1 had no con
fidence.
"Now mark what happened. About a
month after I had stopped smoking I
began to have periodical indigestion.
followed by cramps, which came on at
a certain hour of the evening of each
day and grew worse and worse until
they were quite serious. I tried all
kinds of diet and even starved myself,
but without relief. At last, on the night
of a strikers' ball I was actually un
able to go out. although I had made a
great effort and succeeded in dressing
for the entertainment. I lay in bed
and groaned for several hours. The
next day was New Year's and of course,
there was a holiday dinner at my
house. Said I: 'I have dieted and
starved myself and it is doing no good.
I will eat one good square meal and
then die.' Bo I sat at the table and ate
everything in sight â made a regular
feast of it. Then, as I was booked for
the grave, or thought I was, I said I
would make a complete job of it and
smoke a cigar. I did not feel the want
of a cigar. The taste had not plagued
me in the slightest all that time. But I
smoked now just to go out of the world
in decent style, like a good diner
should. Then I smoked another cigar.
Having done my duty I patiently
awaited for the pains to begin. They
did not do so, nor have they at any
time since done so. I have not had
trouble from that day to this."â Mobile
Daily Register.
Calumet's Mixed Population.
The Western mining camp of three and
four decades ago has been immortalized
by Bret Harte and other lesser but capa
ble writers of mingled fact and fiction. i
There are to-day greater mining camps I
in the United States than ever before In '
its history, for the country now leads the
world in the production of mineral j
wealth. Rut the camps of to-day are lit
tle like their predecessors of the fifties I
and sixties. Mining has become more of a
science and less of a gamble; law, order !
and starched shirts have replaced the pic- i
turesque garb and more picturesque pro- !
fanity of the early days, and to-day tne i
miner is as apt to be a deacon In thÂ« i
Methodist church as a reckless mortal I
who divides his time between working on I
a grubstake when in hard luck and play-
Ing faro bank when flush with funds.
The greatest mining camp in the world is
Johannesburg, in far-away South Africa, !
where gold is mined at the rate of $5,000.- j
000 and $8,000,000 a month. The second larg
est is Butte. Mont., and closely press
ing it is Calumet, Mich. Both Butte and
Calumet are copper camps, and it Is a no- '
table fact that, with the sole exception i
of the Kimberly diamond mines, the most I
profitable mining properties of the entire I
world are those producing copper.
Ethnologlcallv. Calumet is a composite.
It is doubtful if there is another town in !
the country wher there is so small a pro- I
portion of American-born residents. |
There is the usual number of Chinese ;
laundrymen and a Chinese restaurateur,
Japanese curio dealers, Cornish miners j
from England, fully five thousand Finns i
from Russia, French-Canadians, Ger
mans, Irish. Swedes. Norwegians, Ital- !
tans, Austrlans, Slavs. Slovak?. Sloveni
ans, Ruthenlans, Dalmatians, Bohemians, I
Hungarians, Illyrians. Jews. Poles, Rus- I
sians, Hollanders. Danes. Belgians, Swiss, '
Syrians, Arabs and people whose nation
afties it is almost impossible to classify.
Ruffle*- It to say that at the present time -
there are no less than thirty-four differ
ent languages spoken in Calumet. The i
immigrants usually modify their cos- I
tumes in partial compliance with Ameri- i
can fashions, but many of them retain I
some distinguishing article of dress or j
headwear. The Italians cling to their full- j
fashioned trousers, cut upon the most
ridiculous bias, and the Finnish women
adhere to handkerchiefs of gaudy hue for I
head covering, while their husbands cling
to the home-made shoe-pacs, ungainly in
appearance, but much warmer and cheap
er than the footwear from Massachusetts
factories. Newcomers from the moun
tains of Southern Austria part with the I
cocks feathers in their hats reluctantly, !
and the Syrians exhibit their fondness for i
dazzling reds and yellows. One fact i
stands out very prominently amid this
Jumble of styles and colorsâ the Ameri
can-born children of these foreign deni
zens refuse to wear anything but gar
ments conforming to the American stand
ardard. The old folks can dress as they j
please, but the rising generation is Van- i
kee, through and through.â From a letter
to the Boston Transcript.
The Plnninkinnink Coal Company has
on exhibitlo . at its offices In Clurks
burgr, W. Va., a lump of coal taken last
week from Its mines weighing over
10,000 pounds.

S pace in the Tenderloin that has never been equaled, and who Â®
Â® became notorious through his connection with the Clara Me- Â®
Â® \*-S Donald case and his subsequent imprisonment, Is dead. Not- Â®
Â® withstanding his trials and degradation he succeeded in keeping Â®
Â® his vow that he would not die in the County Hospital. He passed Â®
Â® away at the home of a friend, 1512 Larkin street, yesterday. Â®
About three months ago, at the time the accompanying portrait
was taken. Swalm, the one-time successful business man, with "money
to burn," had degenerated into a genteel and persistent saloon bum,
who obtained money from his friends to secure food and lodging and
invariably spent it all for whisky, walking the streets at night to save
the price of a cheap bed.
In the famous trial in which he was accused of stealing jewels
and securities from his intimate, Clara Belle McDonald, the former
wife of the now notorious â¢'Dick" McDonald of Pacific Bank fame, the
woman's testimony consigned Swalm to San ijuentin for seven years.
He nerved live and a half years, and upon his release wrote a book en
titled "He Shall Be Damned." It was a story of his life and a roast
for the McDonald family. The fabulous sum of $40,000 was offered
Swalm for the copyright, but he had the book dramatized and refused
to sell for U-ss than $100,000. He took a large number of subscriptions
for the book and collected a large amount of money In advance. How
ever, the publication never appeared, but Swalm took the funds and
what he hail when he left prison and went the same old hot pace as
long as he had a dollar left. He was the idol of the Tenderloin and
the best thing in town for the "cabbies," his hack bills averaging
$100 per month. He was regarded as the ablest life Insurance so
licitor in town and is said to have been the only man who ever suc
ceeded in writing a policy for the late "Jim" Fair.
The story of Swalm's life just prior to- the time he got Into trouble
is a very shady one and will probably never be written. Deceased
was about 47 years old. The immediate cause of death was paralysis.
He was a native of New York.

A NEW MEGAPHONE.
Orators lo Be Audible at a Distance
of Mijefe.
Provisional protection has just been
granted for an invention that is said to
carry the voice loudly and clearly for a
distance of miles.
It is claimed by the inventor that
the fitting of his apparatus in the
House of Commons, and connecting it
to Hyde Park, would allow of
thousands of people hearing in clear
tcmes every word spoken In the Parlia
mentary chamber.
This discovery of the power to mag
nify all sounds, both vocal and instru
mental, has been made by Horace L.
Short consulting mechanical engineer,
of New Maldon, Surrey. The inventor
has a varied and world-wide experi
ence, although only a young man. Edu
cated at the Risley Grammar Scho-ul,
Derby, he was afterward employed at
the Stanton Iron Works in the Mid
lands, at Messrs. Crompton & Co.'s,
electricians, and ultimately at the
Chatham dockyard. He resigned this
last position to go to Mexico as chief
engineer of the Compagnie Mint-rale de
Panuco. It was there that he brought
his experiments, with what is really a
phonographic voice trumpet of great
distance-covering capacity, to the
pitch of what he regards as practical
success.
A Dally Mail representative saw the
instrument working indoors, and had
an Interview with Mr. Short, who took
the apparatus to pieces in his presence.
The simplicity of the discovery is, per
haps, the most important part of the
Invention. Without divulging any de
tails which it is necessary to keep a se
cret until the patents now applied for
in different parts of the world have
been granted, it may be stated that the
apparatus consists of a phonograph
with special cylinders and bearing a
funnel-shaped mouthpiece.
Most persons have heard with tubes
in tht-ir ears the records of the phono
graph. The new instrument gives forth
the musical and vocal sounds in such
volumes as to be almost deafening in
an ordinary-sized room, and, ag Mr.
Short showed, he could increase this
volume at will.
"My instrument," he said, "will
work distinctly and with satisfaction
over two miles, and this 1 have actually
proved. It is only six months since I
returned to England, but the experi
ments made in that time convince me
that the voice can be conveyed over
treble that distance with ease. My first
Idea of its use was for ship captains
when in a heavy fog at sea, or for ships
passing each other at night at a dis
tance when their lights only were vis
ible. Now, however, I realize that
telephones can be made by the new
sound magnifier to amplify a speaker's
voice so that it will fill the largest hall.
This will allow of a political speaker or
professional vocalist entertaining three
or femr audiences seated in halls wide
apart at one and the same time.
"In time of war the admiral In com
mand will by means of my inven
tion be able to issue his own order? by
word of mouth to the different ships of
his squadron. Lighthouses may speak
to ships in dangerous positions, and the
vessels themselves communicate in the
same way with the coast by aid of this
Invention. Orderlies will no longer
risk their lives, except where abso
lute secrecy is required, in carrying
orders under fire from a commanding
general to the battalions of his army.
"Just as the power of the eye has
been increased, so that the distance be
tween the heavens and the earth has
been considerably decreased, so has
this discovery intensified the space over
which the human voice, and sound gen
erally, will travel."â London Daily
Mail.
DOWN EAST SAKDINES.
Not for Years Have Its Factories
Done So Well as Now.
There have been unusual evidences
of prosperity in Milbridge during the
Bummer, notwithstanding the fact that
it has been an off year for business all
over the country. The shipping has suf
fered to some extent on account of the
war, and there have been no vessels
built in this vicinity, but the sardine
fishing and granite industries have
flourished and a large amount of busi
ness has been done.
The sardine factories in Milbridge
have not done so well in years as they
hayÂ« this season. The herring have
been plenty ever since early spring, and
the factories have never been obliged
to stop work a single day for the want
of fish. The herring now are striking
off, and are not much caught in the
weirs, but plenty of them are found at
difforent points from Grand Menan to
Mount Desert Island, so that the fac
tories are assured of a good supply un
til they close up in December.
Thousands of cases of sardines have
been packed by the two factories here,
and as the price has been fairly good
during the summer the packers have
made money. As far as this season is
concerned the packers here are glad the
sardine trust was not formed, as they
s;iy that they have realized more from
their packs this season than they could
have got from the trust.
It is estimated that the sardine pack
this year will be double what it was
last season. The factories have kept
many people constantly employed, the
fishermen have found a ready sale for
their herring:, and everybody here has
got a taste of the prosperity. The em
ployes of the factories have received
fairly good waers and steady employ
ment, so that all have been able to lay
up Bomathittg for the winter. â Bangor
Whig and Courier.
Too Long, Though Cut.
A new play by a not unknown play
wright was road recently to th^ company
of a London theater by the author, whose
I spoken laiiKuago tenrls to the elision of

(â tip of the rompany after the rending
"what did you think of Aâ 'a play?"
"Too lonj?, too long," was the reply;
"took three hours to read, without the

DO NOT WIT
THE MARRIAGE
TIES BROKEN
New Trouble Over the
Stoddard Nuptials.
HIS WIFE'S PEOPLE ANGRY
THEY SAY HE MUST LIVE
WITH HIS BRIDE.
An Ante-Matrimonial Agreement to
Separate That Is Being Strained
to the Bursting
Point.
There Is more trouble brewing over the
Stoddard-'Wilson nuptials, solemnized so
suddenly and sensationally on December
13 la.st. The trouble again comes from
the your.g lady's side of the house, and
is due to the fact that Stoddard has re
fused to live with his young wife and is
about to commence proceedings to have
tlii' marriage annulled.
When Stoddard, yielding to pressure of
the most energetic character, agreed to
marry Irma AVilHon he did so with the
understanding that lie would give the
girl his name, but not his company; and
when fifteen minutes after the wedding
he left her and her mother it was "for
good," and he says ail parties under-
Btood it to be so.
Since his marriage Stoddard has re
ceived praise enuugh for being willing to
repair a wrong, but not much for the
wisdom of his willingness, the comments
coming chiefly from his father, Captain
Stoddard of Reno. The elder Stoddard is
not anxious to have the girl for his
daughter-in-law, and under his direction
young btoddard. is preparing a suit to
have the marriage annulled on the ground
of coercion, backed by the fact that he
has never lived with his wife.
When news of his intentions reached
Sacramento, whore, since the marriage,
Irma Wilson-Stoddard and her mother,
Mrs. Overly, have been staying, the girl
and her mother and her stepfather start
ed at once for here. They arrived Monday
evening.
The girl's people have had one interview
with the young husband, the substance
of which \v;iH an Inquiry on their part
as to what he was going to do, and a
reply on his that he was going to have
the marriage annulled according to agree
ment. They said it was not right, that
the girl's reputation was being Injured
by liis absence from her side, and he de
clared he had done nil they had demanded
of him. and for anything further they
could talk to his attorney, E. N. !>'>u
prey. There were some threats and high
words and then the girl's mother secured
the services of W. H. H. Hart, and the
fight is on.
"I have kept my part of the agree
ment," said Btoddard last night, "and I
do not intend to do any more. It was un
derstood at the time r married the girl
that I was never to live with her. and I
never have lived with her. There was no
reason why I should have married her in
the first place except that I was harried
by threats, and I thought to prevent scan
dal for both of us by consenting to the
ceremony.
"I made a mistake, but I do not intend
to make the further mistake of living
With the girl. One of the conditions was
that I should secure a separation, and
they have no right now to try to force me
to absolve them from their agreement.
They threaten to expose me, but every
thing that could be published about me
has been published, so what further is
said can do no more harm."
The Climate of Cape Colony.
The climate of the Cape Colony, and In
deed of South Africa, may be compared to
that of the south of Europe and the north
of Africa, with frnst and snow on the
highest lands and subtropical belts on the
lowest lying parts, as in Natal, Zululand
and Mashonaland. It may be roughly
sail that any part of South Africa is
better for those suffering from chest com
plaint than is the climate of our home
country at the most trying part of the
year. But those who come to South
Africa hoping to escape from this disease
should not, as a general rule, delay on the
CO;ist.
The Cape Peninsula is delightful for
most people, but it is not by any means
best for those who are constitutionally
inclined to consumption. They must
leave the coast, n< m.-itur how many in
ducements there may be for them to stay,
and rlimb the tableland, which faces them
at whatever port they may land. At ir
regular distances from the sea we have
probably nowhere more than a hundred

LONDON LADIES' PETS.
Queer and Weird Creatures Which
Find Favor in England.
In the ordinary course of things
wolves are not regarded as desirable
household pets; but in the neighbor
hood of Regent's Park, appropriately
enough, there is one often to be seen
taking its walks abroad, securely muz
zled, and in the charge of either a lady
or a gentleman.
A Daily Mai! representative called
the attention of Albert E. Jamrach. the
naturalist, of St. George street East, to
the fact, and asked him whether keep
la* 1 wild animals as pets was coming
at all into vogue. His reply was that,
while wolves were not popular pets
among ladits, there were some very
weird creatures from the desert, or the
prairie, or the jungle that nowadays
found their way into a household.
Several instances were given. As a
rule, he said, ladies prefer small ani
mals as pets. A very popular pet is
the coati, which is sometimes
knuwn as an ant-eater, its home is In
South America, and it very quickly be
comes tame. It is, about the ?ize of a
badger, and can be safely kei>t in the
house, or it can be allowed to frolic
about the garden if there are not any
flowers in the way.
The suricat, which comes from South
Africa, very readliy submits to a quiet
domestic life. The late Frank Buck
land always kept two specimens in his
room. The suricat is a carniverous
animal, about as large as a ferret, and
is a great favorite with Zulus and
Kaffirs, who almost worship it.
Lately there has been a great demand
for the mongoose, a curious little ani
mal which is introduced in one of Rud
yard Kipling's famous jungle stories.
The mongoose, which no doubt owes its
popularity to Kipling, has rather a
fiery spirit, and is useful as a rat
catcher, but it can be remarkably tame,
and then it finds a warm place in the
hearts of lady admirers.
Up to a few years ago th<= kinkajou,
a native of South America, had a
prominent place in English homes, but
it ran away before the advance of the
railway engine, and is now running
wild in inaccessible parts of the great
southern continent. Formerly the kin
kajou, which has a very fine prehensile
tail, was seen in many houses but it
is now rarely seen. There is one In
the Zoological Gardens, and the keeper
proudly points it out to ladies, who
at once fall in love with it. Among
animals other than dogs which ladies
keep as pets are large squirrels, Aus
tralian opossums and kangaroos.
â¢ Birds as pÂ» ts have gone almost nut of
fashion, and there Is now scarcely any
demand for them. In the old days,
well-stocked aviaries were to be seen
in nearly every ladv'p house, but the
poor birds have been forsaken since the
advent of bicycles, and they are scarce
ly ever inquired for now.
At the present time the most popular j
birr! is the orange-flanked parrakeet,
which is delightfully tame, one of Its
principal recommendations beinsr that |
it willingly takes Its food while perched |
on a lady's finger.â London Daily Mail, j
The Crop of Fools.
I have repeatedly advffied my readers i
that any concern that will guarantee
more than the legal rate of Interest may j
b.. sot down aa a fraud. Millions of idle
capital are soklnp Investment In New
York at the legal rate of interest and will :
pay a bonus to obtain thin rate. It is i
therefore, unnecessary for those who
hnvp "sure thinps" in the Investment lfno
to hunt up subscribers.
The police of New York lias just broken i
up a gaiiÃ which lias been operating as ;
bankers and brokers In handsome offires j
near Wall street, and whiih has scatter- j
ed alluring circulars throughout thy coon- j
try explaining how enormous profits
could be made in wheat and stocks be- j
cause of the firm's alleged olose oonnoc- !
tion with Armour, Letter and other ram- !
ous operators. A real estate speculative
branch was connected with this stock ;
brokerage firm, and it was doing a s^vlm- |
ming business when the police stepped in !
and arrested the entire outfit. So many
warnings have been given in reference '
to the operations of similar schemes that
it would seem as if the Intelligent public
would be thoroughly informed regarding i
such matters, but it has been well said
that "the crop of fools is eternal."â Frank
Leslie's Weekly.
An Early "Too Too."
I think that we hnd discussions many
years ago about the early use of this
now, fortunately, decadent expression. I
have just come across it in Johnson's
I translation of "Ambrose Parey," London,
16411. folio:
"That leaving this tno too cruel way of
healing (by the actnnl cautery), they
. would embrace this nÂ»w (by tying the
arteries), which I thtnk was taught me
! by the special favor of the sacred Deity."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 4.â Stocks were reactionary
tn the forenoon, but forged strongly upward
In tin? afternoon, led by high priced specialties.
Including Brooklyn Transit, Sugar and Tobac
co. The opening was irregular with a tendency
both here and in London to take profits, and
prices reacted moderately after the initial
trading. Professional traders sought diligently
to reach stop loss orders. Many shares eased
oft considerably but a number of stocks show
ed marked resistance, notably Brooklyn Tran
sit, Pullman and Great Northern preferred. St.
Paul maintained a point advance on its remark
able statement for the fourth week in Decem
ber, showing an increase of nearly $252,000 in
gross earnings. A better tone developed in the
afternoon and continued until the close. Brook
lyn Transit made a total gain of S points on
Its showing of an increase of $664. 6;,; in its
gross earnings for the year. There were in
sistent rumors of a pending deal which insiders
would not discuss, but there were intima
tions that the control of surface and elevated
lines in Brooklyn might come into the hands
of the company. While there are large gains
In many cases and the closing was strong, the
advance in standard shares was generally
moderate. The rise In wheat stimulated inter
est in many of the Western railroad shares.
The advance of 6 points in American Tobacco
was unaccompanied by any new developments
In the property. There were large purchases
by interests identified with the company and
the movement was thought to be manipula
tion against the short interest, which has re
cently been created by the formation of rival
concerns. The Reading stocks were pressed
for sale in the early hours and declined sharp
ly. These shares failed to respond to the sub
sequent general show of strength.
The bond market lapsed into dullness to-day
but there was no abatement of the re<ent pro
nounced strength. Total sales, $3,^1

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. â The Liverpool wheat mar
ket was the chief influence here at the start.
Cables came Id lower for futures. Such ap
parent eagerness abroad to emphasize the weak
ness in this market caused the selling out of
a heavy line of long wheat here. May opened
a fraction lower with sellers at from 70% c
down to 70%e. So much was for sale that the
price was torced down to 70',-ic before intend
ing buyers could shout bids. The Atlantic
port clearances, however, began to have a
bullish effect when Philadelphia reported 350,
---000 bushels of wheat and flour shipped for ex
port. When other seaboard cities swelled the
total exports for twenty-four hours to over
1,100,000 bushels the feeling of speculators
found expression in a quick advance to 71 1 %c.
Reports of a cold wave from the north, which
it was claimed would cause severe damage to
the winter wheat, had a strengthening influ
ence. The market then became very bullish.
Shorts covered freely and there were heavy
buying accounts, which resulted In advancing
May to 71%e. That was above call price and
realizing on privileges caused a slight reac
tion near the end. May closing at 71%@71%c.
1 Wet weather, which was considered likely to
curtail receipts, strengthened corn. There was
also a good export demand. May closed %c
higher.
Oats ruled active and higher. The advance
was due to a good cash demand moderate re
ceipts, unfavorable weather and the advance
in other grains. May closed %c higher.
A disappointingly heavy increase in the
stocks of hog products for December depressed
provisions early. At the resulting decline,
however, commission houses had numerous
buying orders and packers who were free sell
ers turned buyers, the consequence being a
recovery of practically all the decline. May
pork lost 2%c, May lard advanced 2%c and
May ribs wire unchanged.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Jan. 4.â The American Cotton and
Wool Reporter to-morrow will say of the wool
trade: While the volume of transactions the
past week has fallen far below that for the
corresponding period last year, nevertheless
there is more than the usual amount of activity
for the opening days of the year. The market
has been influenced by the holiday season and
by the fact that everybody's attention has been
more or less devoted to closing up the books
for the year. The next event which everybody
is looking forward to is the opening of the
heavy-weight season, which will probably take j
place within the next two or three weeks.
There is a feeling of mild hopefulness on the
part of the wool trade as regards the charac
ter of the next good season.
The sales for the week in Boston amount to
3,079,000 pounds domestic and 717,000 pounds for
eign, making a total of 3,796,000. against a total
of 3,795,000 for the previous week, and a total
of 7,650,000 for the corresponding week last year.

i SUICIDE OF MYRTLE
BROCEE, VARIETY ACTRESS
Shot Herself at Dawson Because
'â¢Nigger Jim" Fell in Love With
Her Sister.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Jan. 4.â Latest ar
rivals :'rom Dawson who reached this
city this < venlng by the steamer Rosalie
tell of the tragic death of the once popu-
lar concert hall performer of Victoria,
B. C, Myrtle Brocee. in Dawson City. On
the night of December 11, when sounds of
revelry floated up to her room from the
bar of the hotel at which she was stay
ing, the variety actress placed a revolver
to her temple and deliberately blew her
brains out.
"I am tired of life, dear Florence, and
see plainly we cannot travel together
much longer. You know well my reasons
for taking this step and will forgive me,
dearest. Please keep the truth from
mother." This pitiful note was found on
the rough deal table in the dead actress'
room and addressed to her sister. The
cause of the act was jealousy. Myrtle
and Florence Brocee, after a successful
season in Victoria. left three months ago
to seek fortune in the Klondike. It ap
pears that both were either in love with
or were after the thousands of the
wealthy mine owner, "Nigger Jim."
Florence was the favorite, and when this
became evident Myrtle became very mel
ancholy, and several times threaten*
suicide.
The sisters were Canadians, their home
being in Lindsay, Ont. They performed In
Chicago and San Francisco before going
to Victoria.

SAYS SUPPLIES
WERE ALL GOOD
Major Harrison Before
the Investigators.
EXCELLENT BEEF FURNISHED
ONLY TROUBLE WAS WITH THE
LOCAL KILLED CATTLE.
As an Expert Butcher the Witness
Declares That Chemicals Were
Not Used to Preserve
Meat for Soldiers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 4.â Major Hop
kins, military aid to the Secretary of
"War, testified before the War Investi
gating Commission regarding sanitary
conditions at the camps at Tampa,
Camp Alger and Tamp Thomas. It was
the old question ( >f pinks, drainage and
camp police, and the testimony oÂ£ the
witoesa was little different from preced
ing witnesses. He had not approved
of the conditions at Camp Thomas ana
in accordance with his report an order
was issued on August 15 for its aban
donment. He knew of no adverse re
port ever having been made to the Sec
retary of War on Camp Alger. If thert
were any complaints they were merely
individual. He knew of no complaint
as to any camp that was not promptly
Investigated.
"What action was taken, if any?"
"Well, for one instance, I was ap
pointed with Dr. Reed to investigate
the condition of the hospitals. The
surgeon general told us to report daily
and he would act at once on our recom
mendations."
Major Harrison, Xinth Volunteer In
fantry, whose regiment â was raised
near Nev Orleans and Is now in service
at Santiago, was next called. Concern
ing commissary stores he said those in
the L'nited States were the best that
could be bought in the open markei.
'1 he refrigerated beef sent from this
country he : aid was excellent. He naa
had much experience with refrigerated
meat and he s.ud that while there was
some disposition on the part of the regi
mental cooks to cavil at the appear
ance of the meat, it was in reality quite
good. He explained that the sudden
change of temperature on removing the
meat from the refrigerator ships pro
duced what is known as a "beard," a
greenish growth that has to be scraped
off. When this was done the meat be
neath was perfectly good. It was is
sued to the men with excellent results
and benefited the sick materially. The
chief trouble came when the change
was made to hoof cattle. This beef
iiajor Harrison killed himself and per
sonally superintended its dressing and
cooling.
"But it would not cool in that cli
mate," he said very emphatically. -'The
meat never loat its animal heat, and
with its use our sickness increased 10
per cent. In a country where our dead
putrefied in six hours you will easily
understand that meat killed and ex
posed tii the atmospheric changes, with
coagulated blood and the attacks of
flies, will Bpoil much sooner. Our board
of survey had no work to do except
condemning and burning this local
killed beef."
' if the canned meat Major Harrison
spoke with equal emphasis, saying it
was fully as good as the refrigerator
beef and that none of it had to be con
demned.
General Beaver asked if a refrigerat
ing plant were established there
whether Cuban beef could be killed on
the ground and rendered fit for use by
the men. Witness said he thought this
would not be desirable, as the Cuban
rait:.', while line looking, furnished the
coarsest and most stringy beef he had
ever seen.
Witness said he was thoroughly I
familiar with the processes of refriger
ating and butchering meat and he was
willing to state positively that there
were no chemicals used in any of the
American beef that passed under his
observation. On the contrary, he said
that there was no chemical preparation
that could be used on the meat with
advantage to the packers and without
ruining their product before they could
get it to the army. He regarded it as
highly Improbable that anything of the
sort had been attempted.
Recurring to the hoof-killed beef at
Santiago, witness said the surgeons in
charge attributed the 10 per cent in
crease in intestinal sickness to the use
of the fresh killed beef. There was a
proportionate decrease in sickness when
the regiment returned to refrigerated
beef. Major Harrison paid he had no
complaint to make as to medical sup
plies or attendance. He considered the
whole supply system good.

COMBINATION
MEANS HIGH
WATER RATES
Must Pay Interest on
Two Plants.
"CALL'S" STORY ADMITTED
OFFICIALS TELL WHY THE DEAL
WAS MADE.
Explanations That Do Not Agree
With Statements and Actions
of the Past Four
Years.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 4.
The sensation of to-day was the fact
published i xclusively in this morning's
Call that tlk- notorious water schedule
- ted under such exciting circumstances
last March had been put Into force by
â¢â¢.. two watei companies and also thai
the two companies had positively com
bined and that competition was at an end.
These statements were verified to-day
by officials <>t" the two water companies,
who admitted that they had found it
ssary :<> demand the new rates, and
that an agreement had been reached,
n. >i that actual consolidation is a neces
sity.
The <'all is in a position to-day to em
ph.x.-iz. the statement made this morn
ing. Last Saturday there was a positive
agreement ratified between the two com
panies, i.i;. article of which is said to bo
that the two plants are to be placed on
one footing and under one management,
and that the officers of the Oakland
Water Company will soon be closed and
the Contra Costa Company will assume
control of the allied plants.
The purpose of this is obvious and will
be the means of yet further taking money
from the pockets of the water rate pay
ers. It means that Instead of the Council
having to fix the rates on the cost <>f
plant H will be required to
!:.\ them upon the lxisis of the
cost of the two plants, which, according
to the opinion of the companies' own ex
perts, Is about ten million dollars- six
millions for the Contra Costa Company
and tour millions for the Dingee plant.
Six per cent on this basis would mean
iver half a million dollars has to be
ted for interest in addition t" the
Ltlng expenses and cost of main
trnati' c.
Presideni IMngee of the Oakland t'om
d< clares In an Interview that th> re
was no alternative but to come to an
agreement and to charge what the ordi
nance allowed. He said to-day: "What
â  iture may develop I do hot know,
but as yet we have not actually consoli
dated. It . :. ;y essential that we
nave an in. reased revenue in ordi .
carry out our plans to supply Oakland
w;-;, water during the coming season
be a dry one.
X' Ither company has made money and
unless w t can g< t some return for our out
-1â¢ k 1 v ! 1 1 i may be without water and
tins will give thi city a very black eye.
'i n. dryness of the season mak<
â  to expend considerable money to
I - ;:l!ii L< :it water, and as a I
re must be additional revenue.
However, even under the new schedule we
â  â â  '. â  barging as much as th.- law al
ows by any means. We are merely pro
gainst a waste of wa
ur â¢ â â  bat hs, closets, lawns, â¢ I
"â¢Certainly, both companies will <-_harge
in. rate, and. as 1 hav<
companies have been forced to take the-e.
rhis statement of Mr. Dingee Bounds
when compared with the
statements of the Oakland Water Com
pany mad.' two years ago when competi
tion was ai Ita height At that tit:,-
Alvarado supply, on which the new <om
depends, was said to be sufficient to
supply a cay of three times the >{â /.â¢â  of
Oakland, and to be absolutely Independ
ent of rain, on which the <'ld company de
pends entirely. These statemi tits were
spread broadcast while the stocK of the
new company was being floated, but now
thing apparently has changed. The
president of the new company saye that
th.; citizens should be glad to contr
to any scheme that will Insure an ada
quate supply when prospects are bo
black.
: -tit situation is, from
a financial point <â¢! view, for the water
rate payers, they ar-- not yet being taxed
"aa. much ac the law allows, bj
b," according to Mr. Dlngee. As tne
rates â  er 500 per i â¢ nt ,-;ince
last January, and 31 pel cent since last
month, the taxpayer fe standing ag]
ring what km'! of a New dear's
joker has been sprung upon him by the
combined companies.
J. H. T. Watkinson is general manager
of the Contra Costa company. The bead
quarters of this company is in San Fran
and whenever Mr. Watkinson la
asked anything concerning the company's
business In the Oakland office, where he
presides, he invariably tells his caller
thiu everything is done in San Francisco,
and preserves silent c.
To-day he broke his rule, rind said: "It
Is true that the two companies realize
the necessity of additional revenue, and
to that end have reached an understand
ing. The Increase in rat< ais absolutely
Imperative, owing to the prospects of an
other dry season such as the last. The
rmes are not as high as provided in the
schedule adopted by the City Council.
They are only midway between the rates
of 1896 and 1898. Under the old rates we
have been barely paying expenses, and as
there is every indication of a dry season
coming, we have been put to extraordi
nary expense In order to maintain an ef
ficient service.
"Yes, it is true, as stated in The Call
this morning, that the Contra Costa com
pany has been obliged to open an im
mense pumping plant at Alvarado In an
ticipation of the dry season. The citi
zens for four years have obtained water
at nominal rates, and it is only right that
they should now be willing to stand a
slight Increase, inasmuch as the company
has suffered in the past."
It Is very amusing to Oaklanders to hear
the managers of the two rival water com
panies discussing the same question in
such an amicable manner and showing
how completely tlu-tr two minds think as
one. Four years ago the rivals were
rushing Into prim, denouncing each oth
er, circulating thousands of pamphlets
prepared by the Board of Health con
demning the old company's supply, call-
Ing -arh other thieves and resorting to
every known artifice to steal each other's
business. One of the main pipes of the
new company at Alvarado was blown up
by dynamite and the new company de
clared it was the work of some emissary
of its rival, while the old company sug
gested that it was done to create sympa
thy.
This spirit was kept up for two years
and the meanness to which the corpora
tion.-; descended is shown by the fact that
whenever a waterback burst in a con
sumer's bouse the opposition company to
the one supplying the house would at
once acquire the burst waterback and
exhibit it as a specimen of what might
be expected by using the other company's
water.
Then came the great revelation last
spring, when Oakland discovered that the
methods of the new uompany were not
any more along the lines of purity, re
form ami honesty than those accredited
to the old corporation. The scandals con
net. | ( with tli" Council were attributed
as much to one compnny as the other
and doubtless with justice, and all the
pi.as.vi! things said of the new company
were called back and the two corporations
stood on an equally unpopular footing in
tlie ' 'immunity.
Now the incident is closed and the tax
payers who welcomed competition find
tiiat they adopted a serpent, for both
companies being united will demand the
legal 6 per cent on every inflated dollar
they claim to have Invested.
To-day The Call published the receipts
of a water rate payer, showing that the
cost for his house had Increased from &)
cents per month last January to $2 .". for
this January. Mr. Watkinson says: "The
rates are not yet as high as provided in
the schedule adopted by the City Coun
cil."
Mr. Dingee says: "We are not charg
ing as much as" the law allows by any
means."
The taxpayer will speak at the election
to be held in March for a new city gov
ernment, and it is safe to predict that in
the next Council the names of Brqsna
han, Heltman, Earl. Watklnson, Wood
ward and Henntbcrry will not be promi
nent.
Trouble Over a Courtroom.
OAKLAND, Jan. 4.â There is trouble
over another temple of justice in Ala
meda County. James G. Quinn has suc
ceeded Fred C. Clift as Justice of the
Peace of Oakland Township, and when
the former appeared at the courtroom,
southwest corner of Eighth street and
Broadway, this morning prepared to take
possession his predei essor declined to
turn over to him the furniture and court
paraphernalia, unless he be paid there
for $2<k>. This price Quin;i regarded as
exorbitant, but ho was ai the mercy of
his predecessor, who had already paid an
other month's rent in advance. Quinn
has therefore rented a store jusf below
the. old courtroom, where he will deal out
justice until the friends of the past and
present Justices induce the former to re
linquish his key.
Burglars Still at Large.
OAKLAND. Jan. 4. No trace has yet
been found of the burglars who bound
L.o Chin, a Chlnes< merchant, this morn
ing and robbed his safe of $850. iiie
burglars had an easy task. They evi
dently knew thai Chin carried the key
of his strong box attached to his waist
by a cord, for after beating him they cut
the key from the cord and opened the
safe from which they took the money.
Sinclair Is Incompetent.
OAKLAND, Jan. 4.â The hearing of the
petition of Fred Sinclair to be appointed
guardian of his brother, Thompson W.
Sinclair, was concluded to-day, and Judge
Hall declared the latter Incompetent, and
as a compromise appointed Dave Sin
clair, another brother, as guardian, and
fixed the L-onds at $2000.
KINARD DECLINED TO
TAKE ANY EXCEPTION
THE CASE AGAINST EX-JUSTICE
CLIFT DISMISSED.
Attorney Chapman Brands Plaintiff's
Attacks as Purely Ma
licious.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, i
908 Broadway. Jan. 4.
The case of C. E. Kinard against Fred
C. Clift. which practically died with the
old year, the main object being to de
pose" defendant as Justice of the Peace,
was formally stricken oft the docket by
Judge Ellsworth this afternoon.
When the case came up to-day Attor- j
ney >l. C. Chapman, on behalf of the de
fense, stated that it" there was any doubt -
In the court's mind as to whether or not
his -Honor had jurisdiction defendant
would waive that point, desiring tv pro-,
ceed with the hearing of the case, the
gist of which h< red a malicious'
attack and one in which the defense de
sired to put in its testimony.
Judge Ellsworth remarked from th"
â¢ he regarded it very strange
that Kinard had allowed the matter oi
charging malfeasance in office to lie until
within twenty days from the close of i
term befor-- proceeding.
"We have been busily engaged in h< :>r
ing this case," said Judge Ellsworth,
"and as yet Kinard has proven nothing.
The main object of the suit was to oust
defendant and the time for this has ex- \
pired."
Plaintiff Kinard here called his Honor's',
attention to the fact that a penalty of
$600 was involved. Judge Ellsworth, how
ever, remarked that he had proven noth
ing, and that the penalty was merely an
Incident. He therefore declined to hear
the matter further and struck the case .
off the docket.
Even to this action the defense ex
c< pted, stating that it would be prefera
ble to put in a defense.
His Honor then suggested that Kinard
might take an exception and get out a
writ of mandate compelling him to hear
the case further, but this Kinard declined
to do.
Mrs. Prescott Returns.
OAKLAND, Jan. 4.â The Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children has de
that Til-- demands of Oakland made
it imperative that it shall reopen this
branch which was closed here about a
.-car ago.
Mrs. Lydia A. Prescott, who had charge
of the office formerly and who did splen
did work, has been appointed to thÂ»
charge she formerly held and has re
opened her office in the Central Hank
building.
During Mrs. Prescott's term of office an
extraordinary amount of g>>"d work was
done <>n behalf of children, and she was
frequently complimented from the bench
for her methods.
Deadlock in Police Board.
OAKLAND. Jan. 4.â The Board of Fire
and Police Commissioners met this morn
ing and took up the matter of tilling the
vacancies in the Police Department, but
there proved to be a deadlock: each
member placed one candidate in nomina
tion and no selections were made.
Oakland News Items.
OAKLAND. Jan. Iâ Herbert F. Patter

aware, that Brown had but recently been
divorced when she married him.
Superior Judge Hall to-day denied a
writ of habeas corpus in behalf of w.
H. Allen, who is held for obtaining money

OVER=GENEROUS, THIS MAN
DIED ALMOST UNMOURNED
OAKLAND, Jan. 4.â The death of John N. Williams in Clare-mont a few
days ago recalls the story of his reduction from a man of wealth to
comparative poverty. About two years ago Williams fell ill, and he
thought he was dying. Summoning an attorney to his bedside, he
deeded to his grandson, C. D. Vincent, all nf his property, amounting to
54- pOQ f with the stipulation that during his declining years he was to re
ceive a certain stipend. Scion, however, he recovered, and the grandson ap
parently forgot to pay the agreed amount.
Believing himself wronged, AVilllams brought suit to set aside the
deeds, A hot legal battle ensued, and finally Vincent turned over to the
plaintiff about $8000 of the quarter of a million, and the case was dropped.
The amount returned, however, represented heavily mortgaged property.
This settlement did not patch up the family trouble, and yesterday, al
though Williams had many relatives, the cortege attending his funeral
consisted of two carriages. One held the minister and the other a daugh
ter, Mrs. Gray.
Another daughter lives in Sacramento, and is supposed to be the per
son who has been sending strange letters to Supervisor Talcott, in -which
she signed herself "God Almighty," filing up the body of the letters with the
word "whisky."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THtTRSDAY, JANUARY 5, 1899.
IS CATCHING
DOGS TO PAY
UP HIS FINE
Farrell Given Just One
Day's Grace.
THE PENALTY FOR CRUELTY
POUNDMAN'S REPORT IS A REV
ELATION.
Casts Some Light on the Behavior for
Which His Deputy Was
Recently Con
victed. "â¢
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 4.
Pete Farrell, the Deputy Poundman,
1 who cruelly beat a small boy and was
convicted some time last fall, was In the
I Police Court to-day, but was not sen
tenced, although he was peremptorily
i served with notice that unless he be pre
pared to pay a $50 line I'or his brutality
j to-morrow morning he will be summarily
j punished. Farrell gave as an excuse to
day for not being ready with his coin that
his employer, the Poundmaster, was dig
-1 King ii up for him and would no doubt
pas it before night.
Farrell s employer, according to the re
' port of the pound for December, should
! have no difficulty In digging up $50. This
report shows that the pound has cost
Oakland a total of $is:< 50 for December,
and Councilman Girard demands an in
vestigation. This immense increase in the
fees paid the Poundman explains to a
great degree the reason for the plight in
which Pete Farrell now linds himself.
Farrell was convicted of beating a boy
after forcibly taking away his pet dog.
As the report shows that on an average
about fifteen dogs a day were caught and
killed, it is not surprising that some of
them were not the stray curs that the
pound officials are supposed to corral.
In addition to killing 318 dogs the Pound
master had collected fees for removing
51 dead dogs, ] dead sheep. 2 dead goats.
'S dead pits and .r> dead cats during the
month. From all these sources, as well as
in amounts collected from individuals who
redeemed their animals, and including $30
for the rent of the pound which the Coun
cil generously allowed for the first time
last November. Mr. Powers' bill reaches
the respectable figure of nearly $500.
To-morrow, when the deputy appears
before Judge Smith, the $T.(l will have to
be "ii hand, or Farrell will not be given
any further chance of catching dogs to
satisfy the demands of justice.
MRS. YON SCHMIDT IS
GRANTED A DIVORCE
SENSATIONAL CHARGES OF CRU
ELTY ARE MAINTAINED.
The Commodore Was Alleged to Have
Threatened to Cut Off Her
Head With a Sword.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 4.
Isabella yon Schmidt was granted a di
vorce fr'.m Commodore Edward A. yon
Schmidt on the ground of cruelty. She.
was also awarded custody of the five
minor children, fur tlv present at least,
and $75 monthly alimony fur the sup
port of herself and children.
The case was tried before. Superior
Judge W. K. Greene, and the courtroom
was thronged with friends of both parties
and witnesses from Alameda, where they
reside.
Mrs. yon Schmidt testified that on one
occasion her husband had taken a shot
at her in their Alameda home, and that
the bullet lodged in the door leading from
the dining-room to the hall, while the
sho< ter Btood In the kit' hen. On another
occasion he had threatened to cut her
head off with a sword.
Commodore yon Schmidt, the defendant,
also gave testimony which the court in
summing up the case severely criticized.
His iath<r. Colonel A. W. yon Schmidt,
was also called and narrated an episode
regarding a quarrel between his son and
th.- plaintiff, in which a flower pot was
crashed to smithereens. He had told
them both that they should be ashamed
of themselves. Witness regarded some of
Mrs. yon Schmidt's associatesâ mostly di
vorced women and theatrical peopleâ as
unlit and not proper companions, and in
speaking of the wordy wars that some
times were waged by husband ami wife,
he said that to his mind "the parties got
along about as well as most married peo
ple do." At times the wife was rough
with the children, but she had always
been what he considered a pretty good
mother to them. On several occasions
during the husband's absence at sea the
wife remained away in San Francisco all
night, and frequently came home very
late, say 11:30 o'clock. In the morning he
would comment on this and Mrs. yon
Schmidt would tell him that it was per
haps 9:30 when she had arrived home.
"But." continued witness, "I could hear
her come in and would get up and light a
match and look at my watch."
Dr. T. P. Tisdale, Captain A. V Lan
caster C. J- Lancaster, Alameda City
Trustee F. J. Fletter and Annie Mellon
were also called as witnesses, but their
testimony was devoid of any taint of
sensation. ,
The defendant was also questioned by
the court as to his financial condition.
He mated that he was receiving $250
monthly, minus $150, which he was re
(luired to pay monthly to Captain Dolllver,
his predecessor as harbor pilot, on a note
for $OF>O given for his goodwill: that aside
from this debt there were several others;
that he owned no realty, save three acres
of Alameda marsh land, worth about
$1000 and some Alaska mining stock.
Mrs yon Schmidt, plaintiff, next was
taken in hand by the court on the same
point, and testified that she was abso
lutely without mÂ»ans of support.
The case was submitted without argu
ment and in summing up the case Judge
Greene stated: "The plaintiff is entitled
to a decree. The weight of testimony is
in h>v favor. It is true that probably
all her testimony is not corroborated; but
it is corroborated in two very important
instances, which in itself is sufficient.
"The insinuations made on the moral
| character of the plaintiff when punctured
prove nothing. The disposition on the
part of defendant to pursue these insinu
ations shows malice. There was nothing
that called for the statement that she
was an illegitimate child, or that her
mother was an abandoned woman. This
was not necessary and did not meet the
issue. No doubt the defendant on reflec
tion would say now that he was perhaps
sorry for some things that he wished he
had not said. His calling one of his chil
dren names at the table showed him not
to be a discreet man. and his manner of
correcting a two year old child is not
commendable."
When the suit was filed, only about
three weeks ago it created no end of
surprise in Alameda society circles, for
both parties are popular and prominent,
and the fact that the wife prior to her
marriage had been a ballet dancer served
as a spicy morsel for the gossips.

GOVERNMENT TO PROTECT
STATE'S FRUIT INDUSTRY
UNIVERSITY REGENTS THINK IT
THE MOST FEASIBLE PLAN.
Chair of Forestry at BerkeleyâLegis
lature to Foster California's
Cattle Interests.
It was decided yesterday morning at a
conference of the regents of the univer-
Bity and representatives of various in
dustries at the Mark Hopkins Institute
of Art that the proper protection of our
fruit Industry was possible only if put
under the jurisdiction of the United
States Government.
This decision was brought about by
Professor J. Wickson. who suggested that
all efforts looking to the prevention of
the exportation of infected fruits to for
eign countries should bo national in char
acter. He drew his conclusion from the
rigorous inspection of the meat exports
from this country by the Department of
Agriculture, by which ' extraordinarily
good results have been obtained.
The conference is the result of the re
jection of a shipment of fruit by the Ger
man authorities. Professor Wickson read
a letter from the Consul at Frankfort, in
which the latter stated that the Presi
dent's met-sage had to some extent settled
the alarm created by the alleged infected
fruit for the reason that the so-called San
Jose scale is effectively destroyed by each
of the several methods of drying and ar
tilicial evaporation.
Professor Wickson also stated that the
endlin moth on apples rould be got rid of
by :i judicious spraying of paris green
and M per cent of the crop saved from the
insects depredations.
The discussion was brought to an end
When Wickson Bald that the bill intro
duced by Congressman Barlow in Con
gress providing for the regulation of the
Importation of nursery Muck and fruit
that may be utilized in interstate com
merce and for exportation will effectually
cope with the perplexing question. The
Department of Agriculture will be com
municated with after a conference of the
State Board of Horticulture, Board of
Trade, Manufacturers' and Producers
Association and the shippers of Califor
nia products, and will be asked to lend its
earnest co-operation for the passage of
the proposed law.
The committee of regents settled the
consideration of the dairy and cattle in
terests by requesting the Dairymen's As
sociation to have a bill passed by the
Legislature to enlarge the scope, of the
â work of the university nnd a proper ap
propriation for the establishment of a
practical dairy school. which wil be loca
ted at Menlo Park at the end of the year.
Professor Wickson recommended the ap
pointment of a traveling practical dairy
â¢ Xpert to give instruction and needed
help to the dairymen of the State. The
bill will also provide for a qualified vet
erinarian to inspect live stock.
In the afternoon the question of the
preservation of our forests was thorough
ly discussed and ably presented by Kili
ott McAllister of the Sierra Club. He
stated that Cornell University had estab
lished a school of forestry in the Adi
rondacks. and he requested that a sinfllar
branch be maintained in the University
of California for the teaching of a sub
ject which was of momentous import
to this State. Chairman Pbelps said that
the university should not take the initia
tive in the matter, and it was decided
that Mr. McAllister draft a bill providing
for a chair of forestry and its necessary
adjuncts, and that the Miners' Associa
tion, which Is vitally interested in the pro
tection of watersheds along the rivers,
take the matter in hand.
MOUNTED SWORD CONTEST.
Louis Tronchet and Ivan de Malchin
Will Meet to Decide the Cham
pionship.
L,ouis Tronehet, the instructor in fenc
ing at the Olympic Club, Is known to
thousands in this city as one of the most
expert swordsmen in the world. On Fri
day night. January 20, he will meet Ivan
de Malchin. Both men will at once go
into training for the great event which
is to decide the mounted sword champion
ship of the world. Professor Louis Tron
chet will train :it the San Francisco Rid
ing Club and Ivan de Malchin in the ring
Of the Golden Gate Riding School. Both
are magnificent swordsmen and depend
on skill and dexterity rather than on
force and chance strokes to score points.
Ivan de Malchin is the winner of no fewer
than twenty-six hard fought battles, and
the contest is sure to bring out a splen
did display of fencing skill and adroit
ness.
Lawlor Recommissioned.
Governor Budd has Issued a second
commission to William P. Lawlor, Judge
of Department 11 of the Superior Court.
Governor Budd's original commission ar
rived at a time when the legal situation
regarding the office now occupied by
Judge Lawlor was in an extremely tangled
condition. This tangle was caused by the
death of the late Rhodes Bordon and a
desire on the part of Judge Wallace to
claim the office, he having been fifth on
the list of candidates for Judge of the Su
perior Court. As the question regarding
the legality of the contention that Judge
Lawlor could not hold over under the
original commission was a knotty one
Governor Budd decided to be on the safe
side and in consequence a second commis
sion was issued.

REVOLUTIONARY
SESSION OF THE
SCHOOL BOARD
Directors Evade an Injunction
and Rescind the Measures of
Their Predecessors.
The Department Restored to the Conditio]
It Was In Before the Last Week in
December â Principals Com
manded to Reclassify
Their Schools.
The Board of Education held last I
night a meeting that will be considered, '
In the history "f the School Depart
ment, revolutionary. Upon the recom
mendation of Superintendent of Schools :
R. H. Webster, the board, by a unani- i
xraous vote, rescinded all but one of the .
acts that were adopted on December |
2S, :)0 and 31 by its predecessor. The |
superintendent and members of the !
board admit that their action is unpre
cedented, but they declare that public 'i
policy and the welfare of the schools !
will justify their action even in the I
court. There is a grave question, even j
in the mind of Superintendent Web- |
ster, that the action taken last night j
infringes upon the decision of the Su- â 
preme Court in the Kate Kennedy case,
but if it does, the teachers that are in- j
Jured are placed upon the defensive !
and must take the necessary legal steps
to secure a remedy.
The board, by the adoption of its res
olutions last night, restored the School
Department to the condition in which
it was before the Ragan-Waller outfit
made the sweeping changes which
closed an inglorious administration |
with the year. In addition to this i
restoration the board made another !
last night and rescinded every order
made in December by its predecessor
and affecting the grade of schools, j
Whi'Â« the new board thus showed its |
supreme contempt for the old board, it I
took the opportunity to dismiss one of
its own employes to rea^noint one who
had served under the old board. This
action won a hearty tribute of applause |
from the gallery, for the opportunity
was one of mercy. A girl who is the j
sole support of a blind mother was
thrown out of employment by the j
change of administration. Vanderlynn :
Stow heard of it and asked his asso
ciates to dismiss their own employe i
and reappoint the first girl. This was
dene by a unanimous vote.
It was long af'er 9 o'clock before the j
board met last night in special session, i
As soon as the Directors were seated I
each was served with an injunction of
the Superior Court preventing the
board from deeradir.'r Miss L. A. Orr I
from the position of vice principal of ..
the Haight Intermediate Grammar
School. Miss Orr was promoted to this
post by one of the concluding acts of ;
the Old board. For a few minutes the i
Directors were st..Tgere<i last night.
They seemed, at the very beginning of
their campaign of reform, to be threat
ens! with the vengeance of the Superior j
Court for contempt. The weapon of j
Judge eleher was as dangerous to I
them as to Wallers and Ragans. There
w > nodding and bobbins of wise
heads, a harmonious blending of the
"club flush" and the "solid seven," and
out of it all came a clever ruse.
The board decided to rescind all of the
acts of its predecessor, within the j
period indicated, except that promoting
Miss < >rr to the position of vice prin
cipal of the Haight school. In this wav ,
the board avoided being in contempt
and won substantially all it sought.
Miss Orr will receive attention later.
At the meeting last ni~ht there was
nothing to indicate any but the most
complete harmony of the members!
There was a little balking when Grant
<'Â Cole. :i son of School Director Cole.:
was appointed to the position of assist- ;
ant storekeeper, but the disturbance
took the form of a simple negative from
three or four members. A little uneasi
ness was expressed 'hen Director Eells
beamed upon the Bcene in a dress suit.
but this was accounted for by the ex- â 
pl^nation that he had no other. He
was positively brilliant and may revo- j
lionize the dress of the board as well ,
hp its rules. It has been hinted that .
Mr. Eells intends to establish dress
suits as the official garb of the board.
After the shock of Mr. Eells' appear
ance had disappeared the members be- j
gan the a Tious business of the session.
As resolution after resolution was
adopted there was many an anxious
look from troubled faces in the gallery.
The school department is in a period â 
of revolution. The most important ac- !
tion taken last night, as already mdl- '
cated, was the adoption of the Super- ,
intendent's resolutions, rescinding the
last acts of the old board. These reso
lutions were unanimously adopted and
are as follows:
Whereas, The changing, transferring. !
assignment or election of principals, vice
principals special instructors or teachers
from one school, position or class to an
other in the middle of the school year de
moralizes the schools, classes and pupils '
affected by such changes, transferring. '
assignment or election; and whereas, the <
late Board of Education has made an '
alarming number of changes, transfers, :
assignments and elections of principals, !
vice-principals, teachers and special In- j
Ftructors In the month of December. l*>:^s.
froni one school or class or position to an
other In almost every school in th< de
partment under the control of the Board :
of Education; and whereas, such changes, j
transfers, assignments or elections mi- !
nosing additional burdens upon the tax
payers have been made without any good
or valid reason to serve merely the inter
ests of the directors and their favorites,
are in opposition to the best Interests of
the school children In particular and the, 1
School Department in general.
Ami whereas, the integrity of our public
School system, the best Interests of the tax
payers and the depleted condition of th^
school . fund imperatively demand that;
such changes, transfers, assignments or j
elections should be immediately set aside.
annulled and countermanded, in order to ;
neve our public school system from Irrep
arable injury; now, therefore, be it re
solved and ordered that principals of
grammar and primary schools will with- i
out delay r< classify with a minimum
number of fifty pupils enrolled in each
cIaJW, provided receiving classes shall
have S minimum enrollment of forty pu- i
plls; and be it further provided that In
the i'-classi(icatioi) principals may so re
classify that the average for their entire;
school shall be at least fifty pupils en- j
rolled in each class. And principals of :
evening schools will reelassify with a
minimum of twenty-five In each foreign
or ungraded or high school class, and av
erage t-hirty in attendance, provided that '
in the reclassilication principals may so j
reclas.sify that the average for their en-!
tire school ehall be fifty pupils in each ;
C sfesolved. That the principals in the j
classification of their schools consolidate;
the last appointed teachers in the depart- J
ment. All teachers who are hereby left
without classes shall report to the office
of the Superintendent.
Resolved, That each and every resolu
tion of the Board of Education adopted
at a meeting of the Board of Education
tiejd on the 2Sth day of December, by
which any principal, vice principal ,or
teacher of this department was appointed,
elected, promoted or transferred from one
position to another, or assigned to any
position, or to the unassigned list, or ap
pointed to a position, or promoted in
grade or degraded, be and the samf is
hereby revoked, and the position, stand
ing and salary of said teacher is hereby
declared to be not affected by said reso
lutions.
Resolved, however. That the resolution
electing L. A. Orr to the position of vice
principal of the Haight Intermediate
Grammar School is specially excepted
from rescission, in deference to the re
straining order from the Superior Court
of this city and county and Issued in her
suit against this board.
Resolved, That all positions and officers
which were created by any resolutions of
the Board of Education adopted at any
meeting of said board which was held on
December 28, 30 and 31, are hereby abol
ished, and all said resolutions are hereby
rescinded and annulled.
Resolved, That each and every resolu
tion of the Board of Education adopted at
a meeting of said board held on the 30th
day of December. 189S, by which any
principal, vice principal or teacher of this
department was elected, promoted or
transferred from one position to another
or appointed or assigned to a position or
to the unassigned list or promoted in
grade or degraded is hereby revoked, an
nulled and vacated, and the position,
standing or salary of said teacher is
hereby declared not to be affected by said
resolution.
Resolved, That each and, every resolu
tion, order or proceeding of the Board of
Education adopted during the month of
December, lS!>s. by reason of which any
school in this department was raised in
trade, be and the same is hereby revoked
and annulled. R. H. WEBSTER.
Superintendent Webster announced
that he had appointed Cecil W. Mark
as Deputy Superintendent of. Schools.
As the position is a statutory one in
the gift of the Superintendent the board
did not have to confirm it.
Three unusual communications were
then read. One was from E. Knowlton,
who, by the last board, was transferred
from his position as vice principal of
the Lincoln School to instructor of elo
cution in all the high schools. Mr.
Knowlton declared that he did not seek
the change and he respectfully asked
the board to rescind the action of its
predecessor.
The second communication was from
C. H. McCarthy, who is vice principal
of the Washington Grammar School,
and was also made principal of the
Spring Valley Evening School. Mr. Mc-
Carthy declared that he had not been
consulted and did not wish the honor.
The third communication was from R.
D. Faulkner, who is principal of the
Franklin School and was also elected a
principal of an evening school by the
old board and declined the honor. The
general resolution, nullifying all of the
acts of the old bos rd, which was subse
quently adopted, covered the cases, of
trie three school teachers.
Director Head reported that he had
ordered the dismissal of all the subor
dinate employes in the storeroom of the
department. This was done, the di
n-tor declared, in the interest r.-f econ
omy. The report was unanimously
adopted. Later in the session Head
moved that the Finance Committee be
on). -red to prepare a report for the
board at its next meeting on the con
dition of the finances of the depart
ment. The motion was adopted, its
purpose being to give the board a clear
conception of what must be dune to
keep within the legal appropriation,
notwithstanding the gross extrava
gance of the board that disappeared so
ingloriously a few days ago.
In the further interest of economy Di
rector Head moved the adoption of the.
following resolution:
Resolved, That the positions of princi
pal of the Mission Evening School, prin
cipal of the Richmond Evenine School
and principal of the Spring Valley Even
ing School now occupied by Madison Bab
cock be abolished.
There was some discussion on this
resolution and Director Head explained
that he urged its adoption because it
would cut off three salaries that were
not being earned. Babcock has been
acting as principal of these schools
simply to legalize his receipt of the sal
ary of each position.
Head wished also to have the board
reconsider the vote of its predecessor,
taken on the last days of last year!
As the board had already rescinded
every specified action taken by its pre
decessor it was deemed not necessary
to proceed as Head suggested.
As the meeting was about to adiourn
Director Stow arose and declared that
he wished to speak of a small matter.
He declared that one of the employes
of the old board, the stenographer. Miss
Cusack, was the sole supnort of a blind
mother. The director thought that it
would be an act of l.iercy to reinstate
her. The gallery applauded loudly at
this unexpected suggestion. It was
pointed out to the director that the suc
cessor of Miss Cusack would have to be
discharged. This was accordingly done
by a unanimous vote, and by another
unanimous vote Miss Cusack was elect
ed. The board then adjourned to meet
in regular session next Wednesday
night.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 5, 1899,
The Late Frank J. French.

AT THE LICK
Commits Suicide by
Inhaling Gas.
DISCOVERED BY A SERVANT
WELL-KNOWN ATTORNEY BE
COMES DESPONDENT.
11l Health and Financial Reverses
Combine to Render Life Un
bearable â He Leaves a
Family.
Made despondent by ill health and
financial reverses, Frank J. French, a
well known attorney and prominent Ma
son, committed suicide in the Lick House
Tuesday night by asphyxiation. Mr.
French entered the hotel at 3 o'clock
Tuesday afternoon and applied for a room.
He was assigned to No. 214 and took pos
session Immediately. He called for writ
ing material, which was supplied, but
nothing further was seen or heard of him
by the hotel people until his corpse was
found lying on the bed cold in death nine
teen hours later.
No letters or farewell messages of any
kind were found in the room, and if he
wrote any he must have mailed them
himself, but none of the attaches of the
hostelry saw him leave the building dur
ing the afternoon or night. At 10:30 yes
terday morning a chambermaid rapped
at his door, and receiving no response
turned the knob. The door was not
locked, and as it swung open an over
powering odor of gas caused the girl to
gas,P for breath. She gave the alarm and
the fact or the suicide was at once estab
lished. Mr. French had partially disrobed
and retired, after closing all the windows
and turning on the gas. He had evidently
been dead some hours, as the body was.
cold. The Coroner was at once notified
and the remains removed to the
Morgue. Attorney F. D. Brandon, with
whom the dead man was associated at
530 California street, was notified of the
tragedy by telephone and was preparing
to go to the hotel when Mr. French's son
Harold appeared in his office to Inquire
for his father. He said the latter had
telephoned to his wife in Berkeley Tues
day afternoon that he would not be home
for dinner, but as he sometimes remained
In the city over night no apprehension
"was felt. Mrs. French accompanied her
son to the city, but upon arriving on this
side of the bay they separated, the
mother going to the home of her sister
Mrs. Thompson. - She was not notified <>l
her husband's death until nearly noon.
Mr. French had resided in this city for
years, but removed to Berkeley on No
vember JO. They resided at the Colonial
until the Ist of December, and then went
to live at a boarding-house at 2247 Ban
croft avenue, Berkeley. They had planned
to return to San Francisco ti> live as soon
as they could secure a house, and it was
for the purpose of looking for a suitable
place that mother .and yon came to the
city yesterday.
Mrs. French is a daughter of the late
Superior Judge William Satterlee of this
city, and inherited considerable property
from her father, including the family resi
dence. Her sister, Mrs. Thompson, "is the
widow of the late Hon. Thomas 1,.
Thompson, who was Secretary of State
under Governor Stoneman. a member of
Congress, United States Minister to Brazil
and at one time editor of the Sonoma
Democrat. He committed suicide at Santa
Rosa in a sensational manner on the Ist
of February last by cutting his throat

THE CITY HALL IS
FINALLY COMPLETED
FORMAL TRANSFER OF THE
HUGE PILE.
It Has Been in Course of Construction
Twenty-Seven Years and Cost
$5,723,794 18.
The City Hall has at last been turned
over to the Board of Supervisors as com
plete. The cornerstone of the big build
ing was laid February 22, 1872, and the
building was practically completed last
year. its total cost was $5,723,794 18, and
the total receipts of the commission from
all sources were $.~>,724.03S 98. Upon retir
ing from office they left $51 30 in the fund.
It is said a new appropriation could have
been secured from the Legislature, but
the commission determined not to ask for
one.
There were no ceremonies of any char
acter when the historic pile was formally
placed in charge of the Supervisors. A
formal report was submitted, giving in
detail a history of the hall from the time
the enabling act was passed in 1870 up
to the present time. The building has
been occupied as its different sections
were ready for occupancy. The courts
and municipal offices were the first to
desert the old hall, the last occupants of
that building being the various branches
of the- Police Department.
Since IkT: v . the City Hail Commission has
consisted of thi- Mayor, Auditor ami City
and County Attorney. The Commission
ers were allowed a salary of Jim) per
month, but in recent years they have not
collected tin- fee.
AN ATTORNEY'S HEROIC ACT.
Thomas Keough Saves a Woman
From Being Burned to Death.
Attorney Thomas Keough of the firm of
Reddy, Campbell & Metson is carrying
his left arm in a sling and it is owing to
his presence of mind and bravery in sav
ing a woman from being burned to death.
Keough was on a Jones street car on
Tuesday night, and when the car was
ncaring Geary street he saw a woman
at the open window of a house calling
for help. He jumped off the car and
rushed Into the house. The woman's
dress was on lire, the result of a lamp ex
ploding, and she made a rush for the
door as Keough entered. He grabbed
hold of her with his right hand and tore
the burning clothing off her with his left,
succeeding in saving her life. She was
slightly burned about the face and arms.
Keouph's left hand was badly burned in
tearing off the burning clothing.
After his heroic act Mr. Keough hur
ried out of the house to a physician to
have his hand dressed without taking the
trouble to ask the name of the. woman
whose life he had saved.

CHRISTIANSEN'S
MACHINE MUCH
TOO COMPLEX
Trying the Mechanical
Voter.
OPINION OF AN EXPERT
WOULD DESTROY THE PRIVACY
OF THE BALLOT.
Defects Which Would Seriously In
terfere With the Expression
of the People's
Voice.
Inventor Christiansen gave a "voting
afternoon" yesterday which was more or
less of a success. Christiansen received
and his voting machine entertained. He
asked every one to vote and to criticize
âan invitation promptly accepted by the
few who were there, and the result was
not entirely satisfactoryâ to the machine
and its owner.
The Christiansen machine was the one
that raised such a storm, partly over its
political success and partly over Its me
chanical defects. It was the one through
which the suffragists of the State were
to record their choice whether they liked
It or not, and despite a demand by the
people for an efficient machine, and when
its rods tangled and its mechanism
snapped and its dials refused to record
the inventor had some difficulty in ex
plaining that the mechanical tally clerk
had yet a few trifling alterations to un
dergo.
Among those who inspected the clock
work politician was an expert machinist,
sent by The Call, and his report is any
thing but cheering. The vote-maker is
built on good principlesâ the mechanical
recording of the people's choiceâ but like
some other party workers it is not above
reproach. There are a lot of rods to be
twisted and sometimes they work and
sometimes they don't. A voter has to
pull a rod and give it a quarter turn and
swear at it. There is a whirr and a rat
tle, the rod whacks a number on a small
dial and a vote Is recorded for one of the
candidates, presumably the one intended.
It is much more complicated than the
average tally clerk, but it does not drink
nor smoke, nor does it draw pay after
being adopted by the legislature.
In giving his opinion of the machine
The Call's expert said:
"I am afraid Mr. Christiansen's machine
needs to be simplified considerably. The
mechanical principles upon which the ma
chine Is based arc perfectly sound, but a
voter would have to be extremely careful
in using it lest he should fail to cast his
vote. In my mind, the machine does not
meet the requirements of a voting ma
chine. It is altogether too complex. In
its present state 1 do not believe there is
one ordinary Individual in a hundred who
could use it withoul making a mistake,
and the election officials could hardly
instruct the voters in the manipulation
of the vote-casting rods. There is also a
very grave danger of the mechanism of
the machine getting out of gear on elec
tion day.
"One feature of the invention that is open
to criticism is that it is possible to easily
disarrange the machine after the voter
has cast his vote. Also, the figures on the
indicating rods are too small, a defect
which would render the counting of the
votes a rather complicated job. A voter
in lasting his vote lifts the voting rod
opposite the name or number of the candi
date he wishes to vote for, anri. the rod
is then held in suspension. The act of
giving the rod a quarter turn records the
vote on the indicating screw.
"Should the voter be careless and forget
to give the rod a full quarter turn, that
particular vote would not register. This
Is a serious defect, and it would have to
be obviated by. some mechanical contriv
ance.
"The adoption of such a machine would
bid fair to destroy the privacy of the
ballot."
MISS ATHERTON
IS MARRIED
The Novelist's Daughter
United to Albert Rus-
sell.
Interesting, though unusually quiet,
on account of a recent death in the
family, was the wedding of Miss Muriel
Atherton and Albert Russell, celebrated
last evening at the residence of the
bride's aunt, Mrs. Edward Eyre, 2209
Buchanan street.
When the engagement of the popular
young couple was first announced it was
intended that their wedding should be one
of the events of the social season. The
death of the bride's grandmother, Mrs.
Uhlhorn, was the occasion of altering all
plans, and the nuptial ceremony was sim
ple and quiet, with only the immediate
relatives in attendance.
The fair young bride, who is noted for
her beauty as well as her many charming
traits of character, is the daughter of the
well-known novelist, Mrs. Gertrude Ath
erton. Mrs. Atherton, who makes her
home in London, is at present visiting in
Washington, I>. C. Mr. Russell, the happy
man. is well known in social and business
circles, and holds a responsible position
in the Western Sugar Refinery Company.
Rev. Bather Ramm of St. Mary's united
the happy young couple. Miss Frances
Moore attended the bride as maid of
honor and Edward H. Sheldon officiated
in the capacity of best man.
The bride looked sweet and charming
in a gown of white satin. There is to bÂ»Â»
no honeymoon, and Mr. and Mrs. Russell
will at once take up their residence in
this city.
The Equitable Life's Statement.
The preliminary statement of the Equit
able Life Assurance Society, which we
publish in another column, shows that
the assets of the society have now passed
the $260,000,000 mark, while the surplus has
reached the enormous amount of $55,000,
--000. During the past year this society
issued new assurance to the amount of
$170,000,000, and now has outstanding as
surance to the amount of almost a billion
dollars, the actual figures given in the
statement being $980,000,000.
The successful record (if this society
during 1898, as shown by its preliminary
statement, should be a cause of great
gratification to the policy holders of the
society, and. as a matter of fact, to all
who believe in life assurance, and that
includes the great majority of people.
Not Damaged by Fire.
The underwriters have made an exam
ination of the premises visited by fire on
Stevenson and First streets last Sunday
and found that the first estimates of the
damage done were in excess of the actual
hiss. For example, it was supposed that
the American Carbonic Acid Gas Com
pany's plant and machinery, at 19 Steven
son street, was an entire loss. Such was
not the case. The company's plant is
next door to where the tire- was burning
and escaped without any damage. Had
the blaze reached these premises it would
have done considerable damage, but no
loss was sustained.

Female Pickpockets Held.
Dene Smith, alias May Johnson, and
Maud Rice, two notorious pickpockets,
were yesterday held to answer before the

Barry, acting for Judge Conlan, on the

each. December 10 they got D. M. Gloster
of Sierra Valley into a saloon and he lost

the East is compelled by the exigencies
or his profession, and that he is at pres
ent in Philadelphia, a member of the
Stock well Opera Company. Mrs. Raffaol,
