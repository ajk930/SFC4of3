Indictments were returned at the
same time against nearly 400 others
who participated in the riots. The in
dictments charged unlawful interfer
ence with the United States mails, and
are based on the fact that on the day
of the riots the mob stole a passenger
train and compelled the crew to carry
them to Wardner, where they wrecked
the mill, and then to carry them back
to their homes up Canyon Creek.

HAVANA. May 19.â was
learned to -night on good au
thority at General Brooke's
headquarters that President McKin
i ley has strongly objected to the C.v- j
! bans surrendering their arms to the
I municipal authorities instead of to j
the United States Arsenal, and pend- j
; ing final decision General Brooke is
! withholding his decree ordering the j
' surrendering of arms and the distri- j
; bution of money. The delay is again
| causing dissatisfaction among the
''< Cubans, and if the order as agreed
upon between Gomez and' Brooke is
not carried out trouble seems to be
imminent.
Colonel Cespedes, speaking to-night |
for Gomez, said that General Gomez
made an agreement in good faith and
with every assurance from General
Brooke that the new order of things
would be carried out. If Brooke now
changes the order agreed upon he will
be breaking his word with Gomez and
the Cuban people, and Gomez will ab
solutely, refuse to enter into any more
negotiations with the United States
and will advise that the money be sent
home.
It is possible that if General Brooke
had insisted on Monday at his meeting
with Gomez that the Cubans should
surrender their arms at the arsenal
Gomez would have used his influence
to have this done. Now will persist*....
ently oppose it and every officer, and j
soldier will stand by him.
General Brooke states that he has re
ceived no Instructions from Washing
ton and will publish his decree to-mor
row. He would not say whether any
changes would be made. .
La Discusion says to-night: "Sec
retary Alger appears to wish to pro
voke a conflict here. He Is more dis
tinguished in the United States as a
business man than as a politician and
his relations with certain syndicates
are well known. He opposes everything
that Cuba wants and favors everything
that would cause bad feeling and pro
voke excitement. His attitude prompts
the question. What does he want? Does
he desire a war here similar to that in
the Philippines? We are forced to- be
lieve that he only approves what is un
satisfactory to Cuba."

MAYOR JAMES D. PHELAN
, has taken the first step toward
the erection of a statue of Ad-
miral- Dewey in this city, by
appointing a committee ' of
eighteen prominent citizens to take
charge of the movement and calling a
meeting of the committee for 2 o'clock
this afternoon at his office in the City
Hall. â¢.-./."
Mayor Phelan â¢is enthusiastic over
the proposition, and he knows the ne
cessity of acting in such a matter on
the instant. He realized that with such
short notice, some of the men he had
selected to act upon the comittee would
have previously arranged to spend Sat-
urday out of town, but he believed it
would be best to hold the initial meet-
ing at once, even though there were
some absentees, and get the matter
fully under way. His wisdom is shown
by a canvass of the gentlemen, for all
but three were communicated with last
evening, and of the fifteen only four
or five found it impossible to be in at-
tendance. Every One of them, though.
is. in full sympathy with the move-
ment and will 'be glad to serve on the
committee and work for the. success of
the enterprise. "' Â£i.--;
Although the Mayor only gave the
matter twenty-four hours' considera-
tion, he could not have been more for
tunate in his selection of committee
men had he taken it under advisement
for. a week. All are of , the high
est- standing In the city and State;
men of wealth who will aid the cause
liberally; of culture, who will take
pride in the plan and will see to it
that the monument! is a work of art
worthy of the city nad State and of
the man. and of such energy that once
starting in, they win carry the project
to rapid completion.
To hear the gentlemen selected talk
one would almost believe that their
task was already accomplished. There
was never a doubt as to the ultimate
success of their undertaking, and all
were eager to begin the work without
an instant's delay. There will be no
lagging when once they get together
and map out a plan of action. i
Not once has the question of funds
been raised. There is not a particle of
anxiety on that score. The one senti
ment that actuates the committee is
that the tribute; to the great admiral
must be appropriate. The members are
determined that San Francisco shall
erect a statue that- for imposing gran
deur and artistic, beauty shall be un
excelled anywhere.
This sentiment is merely in keeping
with the feeling that imbues' every citi
zen. One has only to read â  the letter
from J. P. Le Count given' below, 'â . or to
listen jto 'the expressions of every man
he meets to convince himself on that
point. Two days have passed since the
subject was first suggested and the
idea has spread to every portion of the
city and is as rapidly spreading
throughout : the State. At every point
j it is received with the same manifesta
! tions of approval. No man, woman or
â¢ child needs a .second to consider the
plan before giving it his loyal support.
In the. schools teachers used it as/ a
'. lesson in patriotism â lesson which
the ; pupils .loved to learn. "On the
streets, in the cars, everywhere the
Dewey statue was discussed and the
/first word of objection has yet to be
recorded... Men will not have to be
asked the second time to assist the pro
ject; few will need to be asked the first.
It may be only a quarter that can be
spared, but when the committee gets
down to work and calls for contribu
tions the possessor of that quarter will
go in search of an authorized collector
to deposit*!..
/ The Dewey monument will be erected
because there has never been a move
ment of the description that has ap
pealed so forcibly to every American
citizen as does this. .In no way could
the people express 'their gratitude and
approval of Dewey's achievement as in
building a monument that will speak
to this and to future generations of the
annihilation of a fleet that but for him
might have devastated these shores.'
Here are the sentiments of the gen
tlemen whom Mayor. Phelan has in
trusted'with the pleasing duty of car
rying out this' great work:
Charles Bundschu â
Shall we erect a monument to the
great naval hero? " Most assuredly;
nothing. San Francisco could do would
'. be more appropriate, and it will be
done. â  I am with the movement with
my whole heart. [ Shortly after ~ the
great fight in Manila Bay I advocated
just such a plan and wrote an article
which was published at the time urg-
. ing our people to thus commemorate
. the great victory. At that time I
suggested the gore at the junction of
Market, California and Drumm streets
as the site for the statue, believing at
the time that it should be located in

The people of the State of California cannot do too much in
honor of the Acmiral of the American Navy. When his country
needed his services, both as a fighter and a diplomat, he was ready
and served with distinction in both capacities. Although his ships
were on the opposite side of the Pacific, the victories he gained
were of vital interest to the people of California. He either sunk
or captured the only Spanish ships which could attack this coast.
Golden Gate Park, overlooking the ocean in the waters of which he
fought, is an ideal place for a statue in his honor."

would be a constant inspiration to the
greatest number of our citizens. How-
ever, the question of a site is of sec-
ondary consideration: the first and most
important matter is to secure the
statue. There are any number of cli-
gible sites, one of which will be agreed
upon later. I deem it an honor to be
appointed upon the Dewey monument
committee. I shall attend the meeting

that we mid show our elation
of his splendid work in behalf of the
Tinted States Government. We have
been deprived of the opportunity of
welcoming him on his return to this
country, so the pent-up enthusiasm of
the people may well be turned toward
the erection of a suitable memorial.
The movement appeals to all the peo
ple, whether rich or poor, and should
prove a most popular one. I will at-
tend the initial meeting of the commit-
tee at .Mayor Phelan's office.

I have not yet received official noti
fication of my appointment, but will
gladly serve on the committee. I
hardly think I will be able to be at the
meeting in Mayor Phelan's office to-
morrow,- as I have two other appoint-
ments; but if it is possible I will be
there and will serve to the best of my
ability as a member of the committee.
The plan is a good one. It is but
proper that San Francisco, the chief
city on the coast, should show her
appreciation of the admiral, and I
think this can be better .lop..- by erect-
ing a lasting monument than planning
a grand reception which would last but
one night and then be forgotten.

however, that all three will serve on
the committee and will lend their ef
forts toward making the movement a

gentlemen named by his Honor, has
just gone East and consequently can
not serve.
RINGS WITH A SOUND
OF TRUE PATRIOTISM
STEPHEN V. COSTELLO -I think
the suggestion of a monument to
Admiral Dewey is not only happy,
but timely. It rings to me. too,
with more of the true sound of patriot
ism than the Eastern voice now raised
in an endeavor to purchase a home for
the naval hero. That effort smacks too
much of commercialism to suit me. Oil
the, other hand . I have no doubt that the
movement suggested by The Call will be
hailed with delight and carried to speedy
success In a monument worthy of the
man and the deed it is to help perpet
uate.
SHOW APPRECIATION.
IN ENDURING BRONZE
BARCLAY HENLEYâ There is noth-
ing you can say sufficiently strong
to express my commendation of the
plan to erect a monument in Golden
Gate Park to Admiral Dewey. He Is a
wonderful manâ in my opinion, easily the
foremost naval commander in the world.
It is particularly appropriate, for reasons
so obvious that I shall not mention them,
that San Franciscans should j testify in
an enduring and magnificent monument
its appreciation of the hero of Manila
Bay.
PRAISE THE MOVEMENT
FOR A DEWEY STATUE
The movement to erect a suitable
monument in honor of the achieve
ments of Admiral George Dewey is
scarcely forty-eight hours old, yet let
ters of approval are being received. It
is evident the people of the coast. in
tend to divert the energy they would
have, expended in. welcoming ; Dewey,
had he returned home by way of the !
Golden Gate, Into, providing some me- j
mortal by which his valiant deeds may
be remembered. Appended are letters \

miral Dewey is held and the popularity
of the movement for a suitable monu

.VICTORIA, B. C., May 19â A thrill

Miowera this morning.. Late arrivals
from Suva say that two Polynesians
have reached Taviuna, one of the isl- i

be the only survivors of a party of
thirty-six natives who were stolen '
from the Andaman Islands by a Slav- J
ing schooner. One of the natives de
scribing his adventures, to an inter
preter told the following story:
"We were stolen. We saw a two- !
masted schooner come into the bay and
with thirty others we paddled out to
trade in two big canoes. There were
about twenty men in one big canoe and
eleven in the smaller one. I was in
the smaller one. When it went along
side the vessel, the white men dropped
a big piece of iron Into the canoe so
that it was swamped. We swam to
the large canoe and were getting away.
but we were fired at from the ship and
the boats came after us. Many were
killed and the canoe was sinking. We
then jumped into the water to swim
ashore.

was ordered to Manila, to destroy the
Spanish fleet at that point the Gov
ernment certainly was considering the
Pacific Coast more than they were the
Atlantic. Consequently the destruction
of the Spanish fleet benefited the Pa
cific Coast more than it did the At
lantic Coast. We should in every pos
sible way show our appreciation of
having been protected, especially by
the accomplishments of Admiral
I >ewey and his fleet.
For myself, 1 desire to give the
movement my hearty support, both in
action and contribution. Permit me
to congratulate you upon the happy
thought that inspired you to start this
movement. Very respectfully yours.
J. P. LE COUNT.
â  Editor Call: Sirâ l have read with
pleasure your suggestion of a monu
ment to Admiral Dewey.
In Trafalgar Square in London is a
monument about 200 feet high in honor
of Nelson. This square is just at the
head of the Strand and is seen by
everybody who visits London. I sug
gest' said monument be erected In
Union Square; that it be called the
"Dewey monument" and the name of
the square be changed to Manila
Square. Don't let this monument
dwindle down to a bust, as was the
case of the Grant monument. Senator
Perkins suggests a bust of Dewey and
a home for sailors. Cannot both a
monument and a sailors' home be built
by the people of this coast?
'England will erect a college in the
Soudan in honor of her successful gen-
eral. Kitchener, and after his death a
monument to him in St. Paul's. If a
sailors' home Is built upon one of the
hills of the Presidio, from which the
worn-out sailors can see the Pacific
Ocean and watch the vessels coming
into our grand Golden Gate, bringing
in the products from the Philippines.
they can say with pride. "I was one of
. the mi who was with Dewey when he
gave those islands to the United
States." First erect a mourjment to
Dewey and then a sailors' home.
Yours truly^ C. G. MINIFIE.

McDONALD MAY

Fighting Chance for the

SAN QUENTIN PRISON, May 19.â
Guard James McDonald, the victim of
Convict Oppenheimer's knife, passed ah
easy night and is restful to-day. His con-
dition is largely due to the ministrations
of a trained nurse, who was secured at
the request of Prison Director .lames H.
Wilkins. It is now admitted that Mc-
Donald stands a fighting chance of re-
covery, due solely to his vitality and in-
domitable will power. Dr. Lawlor states,
however, that in case of blood-poisoning
, following traumatic pneumonia death
must ensue.
With the news of the guard's chance of j
life the excitement and indignation lead-
ing to a plan to lynch the murderer has
almost subsided. Sheriff Taylor Is pre- ;
pared' to cope, with any difficulty that may i
arise, and staled to-day that twenty-five !
, trusty men were in readiness to serve the
interests of law and order whenever it
became necessary.
The situation here is unchanged. Cap
â¢â¢ tain Edgar remains inflexible in his de
: termination not to place "Frisco Slim,"
i John Neill, "Jack" Wilson and William
: Phelan in the dungeon, and the guards
do not hesitate to say that the hatred
i borne Captain Birlem, who interfered in
the affair by request, is the reason for
I this apparent indifference. Not even the
fact that an unruly convict was found in
. possession of a dirk last evening has pro-
duced any change in Edgar's or Hale's
policy.
"If any of my men are afraid." says Mr.
Hale, "let them resign and I will fill their
places with men who are not."
The guards assert that this stricture is
unjust. They are not afraid, but think
It the better part of valor to take pre-
cautions against being stabbed in the
back when there is danger of it. At least,
so the guards say, the suspects should be
searched every day for weapons.
One piece of information hitherto print-
ed is untrue. It was stated that the con-
vict found with a knife yesterday was
thrown into the dungeon. Warden Hale
; and Captain Edgar have not even seen
| fit as yet to punish the prisoner, for it
. ! would be a tacit admission that theirs is
! the. policy of error.
It is stated on good authority that the
' existing condition of affairs will be drawn
i to the attention of the Prison Directors
by a petition to be presented at their
| meeting at Folsom to-morrow. Director
Wilkins has been appealed to personally,
but refuses to make any statement for
publication. .:':-
Guard McDonald took a sudden turn
for the worse this evening, and the offi
cials believe his death is only a question
of hours.

PROFESSOR PERHAM WELCOME.
Important Educational Work for Him
at Stockton.
STOCKTON, May 19â The action of the
Board of Education last night in select
ing Professor F. E. Perham to be the
head of the local High School gives gen
eral satisfaction. Professor Perham is. at
present Superintendent of Schools of
Berkeley. D. R. Wood will also come
from the University of California to take
charge of the science classes. Professor
D. A. Moberly. who resigned the princi
pal-hip of the. High School, will, it is un
derstood, enter the Presbyterian ministry.
Professor Perham comes at a time when
he will have his hands full. A new High
School building is in contemplation and
there is a desire on the part of many to
rearrange the system of study in the
higher classes with a view of giving the
school a higher rating abroad. Professor
Perham will have a salary equal to any
paid in the State in similar positions. He
was not an applicant for the position, but
the board has had him in view for some
time. :Y~-:~Y
SURVEY OF CANAL ROUTES.
WASHINGTON, May 19.-Amon^ those
under consideration for membership on
the new isthmian Canal Commission as
engineers from civil life are Messrs. Bogue
of New York, formerly chief engineer of
the Union Pacific Railroad; Morrison of
New York, a prominent bridge engineer,
and Noble of Chicago, at present a mem
ber of the Deep Waterway Commission.
As the rainy season is about to begin on
the isthmus it is realized that- the com
mission cannot do much in the way of
active operations at present beyond mak
ing a trip over the Panama, route via the
railroad and perhaps making some inves
tigations into the comparative merits of
the different ports that must form the
termini of the canal. In the early fall,
however, operations will be prosecuted
with the utmost vigor and an attempt
made to carry out the. direction of Con
gress to submit a report during the next
session. .
GHOULISH CORRUPTION.
NEW YORK, May The. feature of
to-day's session of the Mazet Investigat
ing Committee was the' unearthing of an
alleged system of corruption in the dis
position of the dead bodies from a city
hospital, a ghoulish. tale that, was well
corroborated and replete with * detail.* By
several witnesses it was stated' that an
undertaker named Marren illegally se
cured the funerals of all bodies taken to
Harlem Hospital, and he was enabled to
do this by bribing clerks in the employ of
the city to break the rules. It was also
shown that apparently an acquaintance

DICK O'BRIEN IS

NEW YORK, May 19.â Walcott, the
colored boxer, who has deserted the ranks
of the lightweights to become a middle
j weight, knocked out Dick. O'Brien in the
1 fourteenth round of their fight at the
: Broadway Athletic Club to-night. Wal
: colt made a heavy concession of weight
; to the Lewiston man, yet he won without
! having to take more than, a half dozen
punches in return for the scores that he
! rained upon his man. Walcott took a lead
with the sound of the gong and, save for
a few seconds in the thirteenth, was
never, headed. He showed superiority, in
every respect and it was only O'Brien's
wonderful stamina and capacity to take
punishment that saved him from an ear-
lier defeat. Half a dozen times during
the fight and before the final, round he
seemed to be going, but every time his
strength came back and the rests revived
him. It was a fierce tight from the start,
yet it was so uneven that it failed to stir
the crowd to a very high pitch of enthu
siasm. Walcott showed improved form at
the increased weight and was wonderfully
clever.

AWFUL FATE OF A
MARINE BLASPHEMER
"I Will Euchre God Almighty's
Storm,,, Swore the Captain,
aod His Ship Became a
Floatiog CoffiQ.
VANCOUVER, 8.C., May 19.â Dr. H. Martin Doyle of New Castle tells
a thrilling tale of the awful fate of a marine blasphemer. The bark Brough
ton started some time ago from New Castle to Coquimbo. Before starting
the cook and steward were taken sick with typhoid fever. The doctor or
dered them to a hospital. ; The captain refused to let them go. The Port
Health Officer was summoned and told the captain that the men would con
taminate the food, and the ship would be a floating coffin in a month, and at
any rate helpless in a storm. The captain pushed the health officer off the
gangplank and made for sea, shouting: "I'll euchre God Almighty's storm
and bluff the eternal sea if every man dies on board."
A letter from the carpenter of the ship to the doctor tells the rest:
Three weeks out we struck a circular cyclone. I was sick in bed for three days,
and turned out to find the ship tearing around in a wide circle at an awful speed.
There was no one at the wheel. I went fro the captain's cabin. He was dead. I
went: to the first mate's cabin and the second mate's cabin. The first mate was dead,
the second mate dying. I rushed below and the cook and steward were huddled in
the bunks lifeless,' all dead of typhoid fever. Myself and three others were alone
left. The third mate could not navigate the ship, and I was too sick, and for twenty
seven 'days we chased around in the awful maelstrom until the cyclone got tired and
turned Into a three weeks' hurricane. At last, battered, dismasted, a floating dere
lict, we were taken' in tow by a passing steamship.
The crew blame it all on the captain, saying he could not bluff the Al
mighty.

Face the Problem.

'''.''' Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, May 19.â citi
zens of Sacramento. are paying consid
erable attention at this time to the
subject of pure water. The Chamber
of Commerce Iras called upon the Board
of Trustees for the appointment of a
commission of twenty-five citizens to
investigate the several water supply
propositions now before the city and
report which one, in its opinion', is the
best to adopt. Opposition to this ac
tion has developed - in the Board of
Trustees and the board has taken an
adjournment until next Monday night,
when it will say whether or not it will
act upon the suggestion of the Chamber
of Commerce.
Sacramento draws its water supply
from the Sacramento River, which
courses along its western edge. The
fastidious have time and again found
objection to the presence of mud in the
water, while others have gone so far
as to enter a mild protest against
drinking water from a river down
which dead horses and other animals
have a. habit of floating.' That Sacra-
mento needs some kind of a new source
of supply is conceded by the progressive
element, and, in fact, by all except
those who imagine that nothing can be
the matter with water that they have
drank for many years and yet lived.
Following out the desire to hit upon
some desirable plan the city recently
' voted $1500 for the purpose of enabling
an Eastern filtration company to make
experiments with clarifying the Sacra-
mento River water and freeing it from
objectionable germs. The tests were
conducted near the water works with
more or less success, but the people
have not thus far evinced much en-
thusiasm for this method.
Another plan exploited at consider-
length by the Chamber of Com-
merce is the securing of water from ar
tesian wells east of the city. Pumps
have been put at work to lift the water
from deep wells and a good supply of
clear water has been obtained.
Another proposition that has been
made to the city comes from the North
Fork Ditch Company, which offers to
pipe water in thirty-six-inch mains
from its works near Auburn. The water
is to run to a point opposite Folsom,
about 300 feet above the level of Sac-
ramento, where it is to be. filtered by
the gravity process and then turned
into a thirty-six-inch main, which is to
carry the water to this city, over twenty
i miles distant. It is claimed by this
. company that should the city adopt this
[ plan there will be no further use for
fire engines,* oiving to the tremendous
force which 'the 300-foot fall will give
the water.
Meanwhile timid citizens who do not
like to take "Sacramento straight" are
securing, in gallon quantities, water
j pumped from a locality southeast of the
city bearing the cheerful name of
j "Whisky Hill. Between drinks they are
| wondering whether the city authorities
are going to give them a regular sup-
ply of clear, pure water, or whether
they, will have to overcome their
scruples and drink from the river, as
of old. - â  -

BREACH OF PROMISE
DEMURRER SUSTAINED
SANTA BARBARA. May 19.â Con
nell-Douglas breach of promise case was
again before the Superior Court to-day.
It came up on demurrer. Two weeks ago
the plaintiff had been given permission to
amend his complaint in order to bring out
more fully the time at which. Louisa
Keutzler gave him her promise of mar
riage, and this amended complaint was
subject to a demurrer, which was ar
gued to-day. It sets forth that the cause
of the action is barred by the statute of
limitation, which provides that a breach
of promise suit must be commenced with
in two years after the promise is broken.
The amended complaint states that the
promise to marry was given in July.
1896, but it was not, to the satisfaction of
the defense, stated when the engagement
was declared off. The plaintiff's attor
ney said that the complaint stated con
cisely that the engagement was broken
off when Miss Keutzler married Mr.
Douglas in August, 1897. thus coming
within the two-year limitation. The de
fense held that the complaint contained
allegations that the defendant had pre
vious to the Douglas marriage pressed
his claim and had been as frequently re
jected by the now Mrs. Douglas, and that
the promise was therefore broken before
the marriage and more than two years
before the action was commenced. The
court sustained the demurrer and the
plaintiff was given ten days in which to
establish more clearly the date upon
which the engagement was broken.
SAM ERTEL'S CRIME.
STOCKTON, May 19.â Sam Ertel was
arrested by Sheriff Sibley early this
morning just east of town on suspicion
that he was the man who last night at
tempted to assassinate Clarence L.
Thompson while the latter was sitting
in his home at Holden.
The suspicions of the officers were
aroused when they noticed Ertel's appar
ent uneasiness as they approached him.
His own agitation. gave him away. At
the jail he said:
"Yes, I did shoot Thompson. If it had
been a little bit lighter I would have
killed the â , too. Thompson
swindled me," he continued. "We were
partners together in fourteen acres of
land out there and he did me up."
Some time ago Ertel sold his share to
another, but there has been bad blood be
tween the men ever since their copartner
ship. â ' -:
After firing the three shots at Thomp
son in the dark and then fleeing. Ertel
headed for this -city. He slept in a hay
cock last night and was making his wav
here after his night's rest when cap
tured. On his person was the pistol
which did the work. It had all six cham
bers loaded and Ertel had several extra
cartridges in his pocket.
DREYFUS UNFAIRLY TREATED.
NEW YORK, May 19.â A cable to the
Sun from Paris says: The .Figaro this
morning reviews the proceedings of the
court-martial which condemned Dreyfus,
who it says 'was not confronted by even
a single witness out of the twenty-three
who testified. All of these were military
men except Cochefprt. The paper recalls
the various incidents of the trial, show
ing that Dreyfus was unfairly treated.
It recalls the effect of this evidence on
Captain Freiestaette, who declared after
hearing Henry's evidence, "My conviction
is formed." The paper says there was
probably never a verdict returned on
flimsier evidence than that given in this
extraordinary case.

DISASTROUS FIRE
VISITS JEROME
Three Hundred Build-

Special Dispatch to The Call.
JEROME, Ariz.. May 19.â The third dis
astrous fire to visit Jerome within the
past eighteen months swept a large part
of the business portion of this town at
10 o'clock to-day. The fire had its ori
gin in the office of .the Leland Hotel,
which was a twenty-room, two-story
frame building. It spread rapidly until
three . hundred buildings had been de
stroyed. . â¢".",-"â â¢.
From the Leland Hotel the fire spread
over two squares, destroying the Ryan
Hotel, Scott & Moore's livery stable and
ten dwellings, stopping within ten feet
of the Reporter office. "West of the Le

number of hotels, restaurants and sa
loons were located. The St. Elmo, Elite,
Arizona, Miners' Exchange,. Fritz's
Place, Fashion, Annex, Red Light, Sen
ate, Connor's, Neef & Mattox, all saloons,
were destroyed within ' a space of
twenty-five minutes.
The estimated value of the destroyed
buildings is $45,000. Twelve Chinese res
taurants and at least seventy-five small
buildings in what is, known as the Mexi
can and Chinese quarters were consumed.
The Are alarm was given by the big
whistles at the United Verde Copper
Company's smelter, and 500 men were sent
down the hill by this company to fight
the flames. The new four-story brick
building belonging to the T. F. Miller
Company was saved with slight damage.
The Hotel Connor, a two-story brick
completed within the fortnight, was com
pletely gutted; the cost of the building
was $.7,-00, insurance $14,500.
Dr. E. T. Cody, whose office was in the
Leland, was the first to hear the cry of
a child in the office of the hotel, and has
tened there and found a fire started on
a bed. He attempted to smother the
liames with bed clothing, and was pain
fully burned about the head and face,
but no serious results are expected. This
is the only serious accident known at
this time. : ' /. "
Larkin's large clothing store was badly
damaged; insurance light. Hoover & Cor

lost their property at the September fire
and were replacing it with what was con
sidered to be a fireproof building at a
cost of $17,000. The walls of this build
ing were badly cracked and its contents
destroyed; no insurance.
The owner of the Leland, Mrs. M.
Smith, Is of the opinion that the Are was
of incendiary origin, and arrests will be
made of suspected persons. "â¢

OF NICHOLAS
His Programme the Fed-
eration of All Nations
of the World.
LONDON, May 19. â The Westminster Gazette gives a
forecast of the Czar's peace programme, which for-
mulates an idea, practically, of the federation of the
world, with the disarmament conference as the starting
point. The conference is to become a permanent tribunal,
meeting every three or five years.
It also is proposed to establish a small body to settle
questions of fact, reference of which to the tribunal will not
be obligatory. The decisions of the minor body will not
necessarily be accepted, but it is expected that its conve
nience will make the practice universal of submitting ques
tions of honor to the mediation suggested.
lii regard to armament it is proposed to arrest their in
crease and to proportion military and naval estimates' to the
total expenditure.
Professor yon Stengel of Munich University, one of
Germany's delegates to the Peace Conference, says he now
regrets having: issued his pamphlets defending war and de
claring that eternal peace ought not to be the/ aim of cul
ture.

Many Disorders Are Di-

HOW TO OVERCOME A CONDITION THAT
MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS EVIL.

â Vetera , and the application of remedies to
debilitated conditions of the nervous system,
has led to the discovery of the great HUDYAN,
the wonderful specific that nature lntenfed for
the rebuilding of weakened nerves. Besides
those dln-ases that relate directly to the
nerve., such an Nervous Exhaustion. Nervous
Prostration. Nervous Debility. Epilepsy, St.
Vitus Dance, we have weakened conditions of
the Stomach, the Heart, the Liver, the Kid-
neys, the Lungs, - that are' due to a weakened
condition of the nerves thai govern these
organs HUDYAN will cure all such disorders.
There Is no remedy on earth that will relieve
and cure Nervous Dyspepsia so quickly as
will HT'DYAN. In most Instances those dis-
order. peculiar to women are solely due to
weakened nerves HUDYAN will correct the
evil. HUDYAN has a peculiar remedial ef-
lect upon broken-down nerve tissue that no
other remedy possesses. ? .
HCDYAN will restore broken-down constitu-
tions. II will Infuse pew life and vigor into
weak, exhausted systems. HCDYAN furnishes
strength and nourishment for the nerves.
If you cannot sleep well or If you suffer with
headaches, you need HUDYAN. It will re-
lieve these conditions and remove the cause
of them within a few hours. HUDYAN Is
soothing to the nerves, and yqt it contains
no -otic drugs. The weakest stomach in
thie world will tolerate HUDYAN.

SUPERINTENDENCY OF
THE WHITTIER SCHOOL
LOS ANGELES, May 19.-In the selec

; which have for some time existed at the j
â  Whlttier Reform School Governor Henry I
T. Gage is up against one of the perplex-
In- problems of his administration. The !
outcome of the contest for the positions I
cannot at this time be foreshadowed. '
The plum involved is the superintendence*
of the school and the rest of the patron-
age at the institution, which is very large. i
Of the two leading candidates for the
superintendence* Dr. Barber and Sherman
Smith continue to make a neck and neck |
race. Behind Sherman Smith is United |
States District Attorney Frank P. Flint.
who has informed the Governor that this |
appointment is the 'single favor he has to I
ask of the State administration.
In Dr. Barber's Interest are arrayed
nearly all the. members of the medical
profession and others who take a philan
thropic Interest in the Whlttier School. j
The doctor made an., enviable record as
superintendent of the County Hospital,
and when he resigned leaders of the Re-
publican State machine promised that he
would be cared' for. This phase of the
situation has complicated the Whittier !
superintendence* so that it Is to-day tied j .
in a very hard knot. When the Governor '
was here a few weeks ago Frank P. Flint
made an urgent plea for Sherman Smith.
"Ask me ' something easy," the Gover-
nor is reported to have said in reply to
Flint's request. Hervey Lindley is said
to be taking a hand in the situation In
opposition to Dr. Barber.

OBSERVANCE OF
THE SABBATH
Discussion Before the
Presbyterians.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MINNEAPOLIS. Minn., May 19.â
Sunday observance was the question
which took the major part of the Pres
byterian Assembly's time to-day. Most
of the long afternoon session was de
voted to an earnest discussion of the
report of the special committee on Sab
bath observance. In the end the com
mittee's eight resolutions were adopted
with slight amendments, and two more
were added.
In the discussion the Sunday street
car, the Sunday train and railroad ex
cursion, the Sunday newspaper, the
Sunday working Presbyterian and
every form of activity which is not in
harmony with the literal meaning of
the fourth commandment was con
demned. Y'Y'Y'
Another special committee reported
that it had not been able to keep Con
gress and the President from granting
the Roman Catholic church permission
to erect a chapel on the West Point
Military Academy reservation.
â¢ In the debate on the Sabbath resolu
tions almost every* speaker gave evi
dence of being imbued with the feeling
expressed in the words of the commit
tee: "The American Christian Sabbath
is in imminent peril; in fact, in many
of our large cities and in other parts
of our land it is already nearly lost.
This means that the American liberty
and American institutions are. in peril,
for of these the American Sabbath has
been both the foundation and the pro
tection."
Rev. Frederick A. Doane of Califor
nia testified that he never, rode in a
street car on Sunday and that he
stopped over Sunday on his way to fhe
assembly.
D. XV. Glass of Baltimore deplored
Sabbath violation by Presbyterians,
and remarked that President Cowen of
the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad,
which discriminates in favor of Sun
day travel, Is a Presbyterian. On the
other hand, it was pointed out that the
many downtown churches would have
to be closed if church members never
rode to church. /-/-â¢
As adopted the amendments depre
cate the secularizing of the Sabbath.
urges members and young people of the
church to realize the importance of
Sabbath observation; legislatures and
Congress are urged to protect > the
American Sabbath; the American Sab
bath Union and the Women's; National
Sabbath Alliance are commended;
every pastor is recommended to preach
on Sabbath observance on some Sab
bath of next October and take a col
lection for the Sabbath Union; the
board of publication is requested to
prevail on Sabbath-school superintend
ents to use a specific Sabbath observ
ance leaflet; sympathy is expressed
with three million Americans who, be
cause of Sabbath desecration, are com
pelled to do secular work on the Sab
bath. \ ' . .'â¢ /
President McKinley-'s attention is re
spectfully called to the fact that em
ployes of the Postoffice and many other
departments of the Government are
compelled to work on Sunday.
The McGlffert case, contrary to ex
pectations, was not reached to-day. It
is likely to 'come up through the read
ing of Dr. McGiffert's letter to-morrow
morfcing. â¢ . .-
To-night the commissioners attended
a great public Sabbath observation
meeting In Westminster Church.
The moderator of the General Assem
bly has issued the following appeal to
all Presbyterian churches in the United
States:
Inasmuch as all boards' of our church
have closed the year without any Indebt
edness save the' freedmen's board, I,
Robert F. Sample, moderator of the, Ge
neral Assembly, in session at Minneapo
lis. Minn., do hereby appeal to all Pres
byterian churches throughout â¢ the United
States to make offering for this, cause on
the Sabbath. May 21. and report the same
to me by telegram Monday morning. This

NEW YORK, May 19.â The Herald is
informed on most, excellent authority
that proof tending to establish the fol
lowing startling statement will soon be
forthcoming:
That Police Captain John M. O'Keefe.
who died on November ,'5 last from in
juries said to have been caused by fall
ing downstairs, was the victim of a
most cowardly and brutal murder:
that the object of the murder was the
sealing of his lips because he had ob
tained information *)f a most infamous
plot which had for its object the as
sassination of Superintendent of Elec
tions John McCullagh,. former Chief of
Police, on November 6 â election
day; that when the details of the plot
are made ~ublic they will involve sev
eral of the best known Democratic pol
iticians in New York. ;
The intent of .'those, who originated
the plot, according to the statements
made, was to cause an assassination
similar in many ways. to the killing of
Robert Ross at Troy, New York, on
March 6, 15.6, by the notorious "Bat"
Shea, a political heeler. who. it was
said, had planned with certain , poli
ticians to kill Ross and his brother
William because of their activity at the
polls in their attempts to prevent the
operation of repeaters'- who had cone to
Troy from New York. Albany and
Syracuse to carry the election for. those
who em-Moved them. â¢
"Bat" Shea was tried and found guil
ty of the murder of Robert Ross, and
on February 11. 1897, was- executed in
Sing Sing prison.
The new facts which throw light
upon the death of .Captain O'Keefe. it
is stated, have been brought to the at
tention jof members of the Mazet Com
mittee, and the case will be fully in
quired into soon after the committee
resumes its sessions on May 31.

SAN RAFAEL. May 19.â A pathetic
little story is going the rounds in con

the popular young member of the Olympic

waters of the bay near Belvedere. It
seems that the"' Sunday before his un-

blind terrier across the hay with the in
tention of putting the" animal out of its
misery. His intention became known, and
the fireman volunteered -to drown â¢ the
terrier, saying that would be the most
humane method to stop its suffering.
"Yes," . slowly, replied Grimm, "drown
ing is an easy death; let the poor old dog
go." \-
The terrier, was encompassed In a sack
and dropped Into he: bay at a point dis
tant only a few* hundred yards from the
spot where Grimm afterward sank. In a

SALE OF SAN JOSE
ELECTRIC SYSTEM
SAN JOSE, May 15.â The First-street
electric railway system was sold at pub
lic auction to-day to the German Savings
and Loan Society of San Francisco for
$225,000. The sale was a forced one under
foreclosure proceedings. There was a
large crowd present when Commissioner
T. E. Johnson began the sale, but only
one bidder appeared. That was George
Tourney, secretary of-*. he German Sav
ings and Loan Society, which held the
Issue of first-mortgage bonds of $200,000.
There was but one bid and it took but a
few minutes to close. the purchase.
There is also a second bond issue of
$150,000, secured by second mortgage, but
there remains not a dollar for these .bond
holders. In fact, the Oerman Savings and
Loan Society, the tirst mortgagees, will
lose some $.000 interest. Out of the $225.
--000 received from the road must come $5000
attorney fees for Jackson Hatch, $500 for
Commissioner Johnson, $9000 for three
years' salary for Receivers Alvord- and
Findlay at $125 per month each, $190 costs
of court and $2000 for repairs on receiver's
certificates. There was some $18,000 in
terest due the German Savings and Loan
Society. â¢
The First-street electric system is about
seventeen miles in length. It runs the en
tire distance of First street out to the
cemetery, with branches into the four
quarters* of the city. It was built by Ja
cob Rich about ten years ago at a cost
of $465,000. Rich became involved several
years ago and went into insolvency. At
that time receivers were appointed for
the road. It has just been about clearing
expenses for the past three years.
The road was immediately turned over
to Mr. Tourney and George L. Barker of
San Francisco was installed as manager.
No change, will be' made at present, but
many improvements are contemplated.
Mr. Tourney stated that while the Ger
man Savings and Loan Society bought
the road, they would not hold it. and he
and some associates would purchase it.
-There are a number of buyers after the
road. Henry S. Burke of the Santa Clara
and San Jose electric road wants It to
combine with their line. Hugh Center of
the Alum Rock motor line is another one
desirous of getting it. If he buys it his
line will connect with it and the power
changed to electricity, with branches to
Alviso and Campbell.

REDDING, May 19.â A report
reached this city to-day of a loss of
from $60,000 to $75,000 sustained by the
Midas Gold Mining Company at Har
rison Gulch by the breaking of a reser
voir containing many thousand cubic
feet of tailings and sluices. The ma
terial was in a liquid state of about the
consistency of syrup.
When the wall of the reservior gave
way the tailings and sluices poured into
Harrison Gulch Creek, thence into Bee
Gum and finally into the north fork of
Cottonwood, coloring the waters for a
distance of twenty miles from the
reservoir.
The Midas Gold Mining Company is
the largest mining concern operating
in Western Shasta. Its equipment con

and a chlorination plant, and to this is
now being added a smelter. The tail

what go over the plates in the stamp
mill. Much precious metal is still re
tained and all of this material was be
ing stored awaiting the completion of
the smelter, when it would have been
roasted and then cyanided. The tail
ings reservoir covered more than half
an acre.
When the restraining wall gave way
nothing could be done to check the flow
of the uncoined money until the reser
voir had emptied itself of more than
half its contents. The sluices and tail
ings which reached the creek" will p_pve
a total 10-.s.

NEW YORK. May 19â The Herald's
NEW YORK, May 19.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: While pressing the United
States to agree to arbitration of the
Alaskan boundary controversy the
British Government has entered objec
tion to the dispatch of additional Amer
ican troops to that territory.
The controversy between the two
governments has assumed a more seri
ous aspect than is generally supposed.
While the President is bound to the
principle of arbitration and while, on
'â  its face, the case the United States
couid present would, it is believed, re-
sult in a triumph for this Government,
: there remains a possibility that the ar
bitration tribunal might decide that the
British Government is entitled to a port
i on the Pacific Coastâ perhaps* Skaguay,
, of which Great Britain desires to ob
! tain possession.
In; view of the great commercial In-
terests of the Pacific Coast of the
United States the administration does
: not feel justified in accepting arbitra
tion and the British Government has
, been given to understand that this is
the President's way of looking at the
â . proposition. So far as I have been able
j to learn, however, England continues
| to strongly press arbitration.
With respect to the dispatch of three
companies of regulars to Alaska to pa
: trol the boundary line, the purpose this
i Government had in view was to pre
-1 serve peace and prevent conflict be-
tween Canadian and American miners,
which reports from Governor Brady
show is likely to occur at any moment.
It is probable, however,, that in view
'. of Great Britain's objection the troops
I will not be - sent to Pyramid Harbor
as originally intended, but will be lo
cated at a point accessible to the dis
i puted territory, so as to be available in
case of emergency. Y.'::Y'Y
In its representation to the American
Government the British Government
! takes the view that in the dispatch of
troops to Alaska the United States pro-
poses to retain by force the territory
which it claims, and that .consequently
I it feels in the interest of friendly rela
i tions between the two governments
; they should not go.
Great Britain had indicated that she
; has no intention of sending troops to
; patrol her side of the boundary line,
; and the officials here have no reason to
; believe she will take such action. In
; fact Great Britain, like the United
: States, is extremely anxious to have
1 the controversy settled as promptly and
i as amicably as possible, but she appre
ciates the imperative need of an outlet
.on the Pacific Coast for her great
Northwest Territory, and she is bend
! ing every effort to this end.
It is apparent that on the settlement
of the Alaskan boundary dispute de
; pends the reassembling of the High
Joint Commission in August. The ad-
ministration would very much prefer
: if the boundary question were left to
this commission to be disposed of. It
iis pointed out that the two govern-
ments originally determined to submit
the question to the commission and
though the commission failed to reach
a decision a further discussion of the
matter might lead to satisfactory set-
tlement. There are ..several other mat-
ters which the commission is practi
cally agreed upon and a treaty pro-
viding for their adjudication could be
drawn up at this time, but the British
Government is averse to making any
concessions unless the Alaskan bound-
ary dispute is settled. In other words,
unless a port in Alaska is ceded to her
! she would prefer the continuance of the
status quo. . .

O'TOOLE' COFFIN
CONTAINED ROCKS
Discovery of a Daring Fraud to
Cheat Several praterQal
Lodges.
FORT SCOTT, Kans., May _..âThe grave in which Dr. Thomas
O'Toole of this city was supposed to '. have been buried, in a remote spot
in Western Texas, on the. 22d of April last, was opened to-day, and, ac
cording to reports received here from the Texas authorities by the fra
ternal society in which he recently took out an $8000 life insurance, the
casket was found filled with rocks. wrapped in an old blanket.
O'Toole had a diploma from th.=, Chicago" Medical College and was a
manufacturer of, patent medicine and evidently making money. In the
past few months he took out $8000 Insurance in the Modern Woodmen,
Royal Neighbors and Woodmen of the World lodges in this city.- Two
months ago he went to Texas, ostensibly on business. April 21 his wife
was called to Sonora, . Texas, via San Angelo^ the nearest railroad sta
tion, by a telegram from one Dr.- Maguire, supposed to be the associate
of O'Toole, announcing the latter!s sickness. From Sonora she wired the
lodges. that her husband had died. and had been buried before her ar
rival there, and that on accountl of the quarantine she could not go to
the grave nor bring the body home. "Â£ ;'
The suspicion of the lodge officers was aroused and they instituted
an investigation, which . resulted to-day in the announcement that
O'Toole's casket was filled with rocks. The Texas authorities have ar
rested a man supposed to be the doctor, but information to-night from
Old Mexico announces his capture there. Upon receipt of the news of
the disclosures here Mrs. O'Toole'fled with her two children. The family
had been in deep mourning since the doctor's death was reported and
seemed greatly afflicted. The doctor and his family had lived here but
a few years and are thought to have come from Mexico.
SIX TO SIX THE
JURY REMAINED
Failed to Agree in the
Murdock Case.
â â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, May 19.â After twenty
four hours' confinement in the jury
room at the Courthouse the twelve men
sworn to try the great Murdock note
case Were discharged at _ o'clock this
afternoon, having failed to agree. After
receiving the instructions of the court
yesterday the jury immediately re
paired to the juryroom and upon the
first ballot stood six to six, and re
mained that way until discharged.
It was evident the jurymen had a
warm argument after retiring. They
kept the Sheriff busy bringing in ice
water, and when the door was opened
two of the jurymen could be seen in
their shirt sleeves and there was evi
dence that a heated argument was in
progress. .-, â¢
j The principals in the case, together
I with their attorneys,, remained in the
courtroom adjacent the jury room until
a late hour last night and all day,
; eagerly expectant that a verdict would
be rendered. The jurymen were taken
j to breakfast this morning and to din
: ncr at 1 o'clock by the Sheriff. . -
An interview by Tho Call correspond-
ent of the jurors gives but little infor
i mation, as those in favor claim those
opposed ignored the evidence entirely,
and no amount of questioning will
bring any reasons for their position
other than improbability.
Expert testimony, however, seems to
have cut hilt little figure in the matter,
yet a fortune has been expended by the
: defense on that line. Attorney Free-
I man, for the plaintiff, as soon as the
: court discharged the jury, moved the
court to set the case for trial immedi
: ately. ' The court said he would enter-
tain such a motion on a week from
Monday. The work of seven long weeks
seems to have gone for naught, yet the
plaintiff's , attorneys seem . in good
spirits, claiming a victory, and are
| ready for another round. ; â¢ .Â;

GARRET McENERNEY ATTACKS
A' PROPOSED ORDINANCE.
â¦
Declares That Under the Guise of an
Declares That Under the Guise of an
Amendment the Corporation Is
Trying" to Gain a
Monopoly.
Are the owners of the Sanitary Reduc
tion Works trying to steal a valuable
franchise from the city? Attorney R. B.
Mitchell, representing the corporation,
says that it is not. Attorney Garret W.
McEnerney, representing the Scavengers'
Union, declares that it is. Not only does
he so declare, but he gives day and date
for all that he has to say on the subject
and refuses to qualify his declaration by
so much as a word. '
The arguments of the learned attor
neys were presented to the Health and
Police Committee of the Board of Super
visors yesterday afternoon, the occasion
being the consideration by the commit
tee of the blanket ordinance introduced at
the meeting of the board last Monday at
the instance of the owners of the Sani
tary Reduction Works. The proposed
ordinance purports to be an amendment
to the existing ordinance â¢ compelling
householders and others to cause all
garbage and refuse of whatever descrip
tion to be conveyed to the crematory of
the Reduction Works and to pay for its
destruction by the sanitary methods in
vogue there. It differs from the existing
ordinance only in that it provides that
the Reduction Works shall not charge
to exceed 20 cents per cubic yard for
destroying the garbage in its furnaces.
It is this apparently innocent and inof
fensive amendment that has caused all of
the trouble and led to the serious charges
made by Mr. McEnerney.
Mr. Mitchell, on behalf of the corpora
tion, explained to the members of the
committee that what was asked of the
board in the way of an amendment to the
existing ordinance was really not of great
consequence to the corporation, but was
of prime importance to the community
at large, as it provides for their protec
tion by naming the maximum price they
can be forced to pay for the destruction
of their garbage. He. rehearsed at some
length the history of the corporation
from its inception to the present day, and
declared it to be a distinctly modern and
civilizing improvement, which should re
ceive the approval and support of all good
citizens not to mention the members of
the Board of Supervisors.
When Mr. McEnerney was accorded the
privilege of the floor he lost no time in
coming to the point. "We claim," he
said, by way of introduction, "that an
attempt is being made to steal a franchise
that nets the Sanitary Reduction Works
the sum of $50,000 a year on an investment
of $150,000. The Sanitary Reduction Works
is here asking this, board to grant it free
of charge a privilege that will permit it
to- levy tribute on the people' of this city
for fifty years to come."
This was sufficiently startling, but Mr.
McEnerney was not . done. He repeated
that the corporation was attempting to
steal a franchise and then went ahead
and proved the truth of his assertion. He
explained that the question of the valid
ity of .the franchise under which the cor
poration is operating is now pending in
the United States, Circuit Court before
Judge Morrow; that one of the points
upon which the validity of the franchise
is attacked is that it makes no provision
for the maximum price that may be
charged by the corporation for the incin
eration of garbage, and that therefore
the people are at the mercy of the cor
poration and have not the protection that
is guaranteed them by law.
"While this question is pending." he
said, "and before it is determined whether
or not the corporation has a franchise,
they sneak in here and ask this board to
pass an ordinance that will repair the
very defect upon which our contention is
founded. Should this board pass the pro
posed ordinance and if on the. following
day Judge Morrow should declare the cor
poration's franchise Invalid, what would
be the result? The corporation would
laugh in the faces of the citizens, whom
they seek to bleed. This proposed ordin
ance would then be their franchise and
the hands of the people would be tied.
Their present existence is due to collu
sion between the attorneys of the cor
poration and the members of the last
Board of Supervisors. Now they seek to
hoodwink the members of this board and
secure themselves in advance against an
adverse decision â  which they have cause
to believe will be rendered by . the
courts. â¢ We ask that no action bo
taken by the board in this matter
until the validity of the corpora
tion's franchise has been finally passed
upon by the courts, or* at least that the
board will submit the question of the
validity of the existing ordinance to tho
City and County Attorney before any
action is taken." *-.-'-.'
1 In reply. Mr. Mitchell denied that the â 
revenue of the corporation which he rep
resents is anything like $50,000. He said
that all public improvements were subject
to adverse' criticism, and he asked that
the committee be not led away by the
eloquence of the learned gentleman who
represented the other side.
After some deliberation the committee
decided to postpone final action for one
week. ;

Hauser is chairman of the committee of
arrangements. He was advised by the
knowing ones to get a sanction from the

itâ did not consider it necessary, perhaps.
When he found out that the Olympic
was an association track, however, and
that the gates would not be opened unless
a sanction was obtained, he quickly came
down from his high horse and after mak-
ing him "eat crow" for a half hour or so
the Racing Board overlooked his little of-
fense and gave him the necessary sane-
tion.

The Southern Pacific and Mot the State
Appears Before the Court and Asks
Dismissal- Railroad Admits Costs.
As gracefully as 'it might, the
Southern Pacific has admitted the
charge made by The Call that it was
he instigator of the persistent at
tempts made by its agents on the
Railroad Commission, Biackstock and
Laumeister, to dismiss the grain rate
cases.
Yesterday Mr. Herrin sent Attor
ney Pillsbury before the Federal
court to apply for a dismissal and
relieve his hirelings of the odium of
a reiteration of their former demands
and the insult they paid the court
upon the first occasion.
Upon the request of the plaintiff
Judge Morrow dismissed the cases,
and the Railroad Commission is now
free to promulgate and enforce, if it
may. the new freight schedule which
Commissioner Laumeister has been
preparing under the direction of Mr.
Stubbs.
Th.' railroad grain case was dismissed
by Judge Morrow yesterday in the United
States Circuit Corurt on motion of E. S.
Pillsbury of counsel for the Southern Pa
cific Company.
United States Attorney Coombs had
not been notified that the motion was
about to be made, and would not have
been present in court had not Assistant
United States Attorney "Woodworth seen
the railroad attorney quietly making his
way into the courtroom. He immediately
notified Mr. Coombs, and he was in at- !
tendance when the motion to dismiss'
came up. The complainant was not re
quired, however, to give notice to the
legal representative of the United States
in the suit. -

Judge Morrow thereupon made the fol
lowing order: "The complainant having on
this, the 19th day of May, _99, produced
and filed in open court its dismissal of
this suit, it is hereby ordered and decreed
that the said cause be and the same is
hereby dismissed."
Mr. Pillsbury thereupon took his hat
and withdrew.
It Is the practice in cases wherein the
motion for dismissal is made by the com
j plainant for the respondent to file within
five days its bill of costs. These costs in-
elude court fees, clerk's; stenographer's
and marshal's fees, but do not include
attorneys' fees, which will be the biggest
Item in the bill.
Attorney General Ford stated to a re-
porter that he was not in court during
the* proceedings. The news that the case
had been- dismissed came as a surprise
to him. as he had not been notified nor
consulted with in reference *tb the mat
ter. He would collect every dollar of
costs coming to the State, and would im
mediately consult with Messrs. Foote and
Hayne as to the manner in which the
State's interests should be guarded in
the matter of its costs.
E. S. Pillsbury, attorney for the rail
road, hazarded an explanation of his
action which did not clearly explain.
Asked why he yesterday moved for a dis
missal of the cases when but ten days I
before he had pointedly ignored Judge
Morrow's suggestion to do so, he said:
"When Attorney General Ford first
moved to dismiss these cases I was taken
by surprise and declined to do so solely
for the reason that I wished time to dis-
cuss the proposition with mv colleagues
and clients.
"Since that time the Railroad Commis
sioners, the defendants in the case, have
adopted a resolution rescinding the La
Rue resolution, the original basis for the
suits, and another instructing the Attor
ney General to ask for a dismissal of the
suits as they now stand. For these rea
sons the company decided that further
litigation would be unnecessary, the rea-
son for it being removed by action of the
commission. As a v consequence, it in-
structed me to ask for a dismissal to-
day.
"As to the costs, we claim that we have
a right to reimbursement for what we
have already expended, but to that we
waive our right and are willing to stand
on the order of the court for an assess
ment.
We consider that this dismissal not
only dissolves the Injunction, but also
throws the cases out of court."

DEATH.
DEATH.
Just back of the Spring Valley reser
voir, off Corbett road, the lifeless body
of a man was found swinging from the
limb of a tree at about 4 o'clock yester
day afternoon by a man who refuses to
give his name. The Coroner's office was
notified and Deputy Gately responded to
the call. He cut down the body and re
moved it to the Morgue. The only prop
erty found on the body was the following
letter, written in German:
My Dear Good-Hearted Woman and Honest
Wife: I cannot stand this sad condition any
longer. It is very hard on me to do this bad
deed, especially to leave you In hard circum-
stances. Dear Emll and Ferdinand, be good to
your dear mother, because she Is a good mother
to you, and how foolish I have treated her. It
is entirely my fault that I leave you In such
circumstances, and for this reason I can't live
any longer. If I could get workâ but I can get
nothing to do so I am tired of life. .Many best
wishes and kisses to your dear mother and my
dear children. The good-for-nothing cigar
manufacturer, Frledlander, .on Montgomery
street, is the cause of It. May the wrath of
heaven come upon him. JOHN KLOPFER.
Late last night a young man visited the
Morgue and recognized the body as that
of his father, John Klopfer, of the firm
of Waechtel & Klopfer, coopers, at 2214
Folsom street. He said that his father
was 50 years of age, born in Germany and
resided at .25 Broderick street. Further
than this he declined to give any informa
tion, except that his father was at home
Thursday night. He said he never heard
of the man Friediander mentioned In the
letter.
The "man Friediander" proved to be
Louis Friediander of 431 Montgomery
street. He says that he thinks Klop.er
was slightly demented. About ten years
ago Friediander, Klopfer and others
bought up a block of land at auction
Shortly afterward the abstract of title
was lost and a few months ago Klopfer
came to Friediander and told him that he
could not find the abstract and had been
informed that his property was heavily
mortgaged. A few days later he asked
Frledlander to purchase the property at a
price which Investigation -showed was far
below its true market value. Friediander
did not care- to enter Into the transaction
and advised Klopfer to have the title
searched and satisfy his mind that all was
right. The two paid several visits to a
real estate office and then Klonfer disap
peared and Frledlander did not hear from
him until he received the news of his
death.
Dispute Over Property.
Stilt was filed yesterday by. the Sacra
mento Bank against Charles Montgom
ery, Richard H. McDonald Jr. and O. F.
Miner to quiet title to a portion of West
ern Addition block 438. In the complaint
It it* alleged that Montgomery claims
to hold the property in trust for McDon
ald. The bank asks to be declared the
sole owner thereof and that the defend
ants have no right or title therein.

Launching of the
Robert R. Hind.
Another new four-masted schooner has
been added to the Hind, Rolph & Co.
sugar fleet. The new boat is the Robert
R. Hind, and she was launched from the
shipyards at Alameda a few days ago.
She was christened by Miss Mildred
Rolph, and Is a sister ship to the Honolpu
and Muriel. The latter are two of the
smartest vessels of their class afloat, and
if the new boat can beat them she will be
a crackajack. The Hind is 102 feet 8 inches
long, 37 feet 8 inches beam and 13 feet
deep, and will carry 700,000 feet of lumber
or 1100 tons of sugar. ;.;?;-
The first vessel built by Hind, Rolph &
Co. was the Muriel. She was soon fol
lowed by the Honolpu and the Robert R.
Hind, and in a few weeks the schooner \
James Bolph and the four-masted bark- 'â 
entine "William Carson, now nearlng com
pletion at Eureka, will be added to the
fleet. Besides these vessels the firm owns
the schooners Defender, John G. North,
G. W. Watson and barkentine Wrestler.
The Robert R. Hind and the James
Rolph are exactly alike, and the first time
they meet there is going to be an inter-
-sting race. That is not likely to take
place until the latter part of the year, |
however, as the James Rolph will go from
Eureka to Australia, while, the Robert R. j
Hind will load here for Hawaii.
Captain J. S. Hellingson. late of the j
schooner John A, will command the Rob- j
crt R. Hind; Captain Piltz, late of the |
barkentine Charles F. Crocker, will com
mand the William Carson, and Captain
Dedrick, late of the Defender, will com- I
mand the James Rolph.

SERIOUS ROW
AT THE HOTEL
SUTHERLAND
Mrs. Josephine Burr
on Trial.
There was an air of refinement In Judge
Mogan's courtroom yesterday morning
that was a surprise to the regular ha
bitues. It looked as if a number of so
ciety ladies had instituted a new order of
things to be designated a Police Court
function. It turned out, however, that
the gathering of ladies was due to the
case, of Mrs. Josephine Burr, who was
charged by Miss M. E. Sturtevant with
the unpardonable sin of using vulgar lan
guage in the Hotel Sutherland on April 2*.
According to Miss Sturtevant, the com
plaining witness, Mrs. Burr had accused
her of showing the Burr room to a gen
tleman who had called to engage rooms.
This roused Mrs. Burr, and ..irs. Gean
drot, the landlady, who was sick in bed,
sent for Mrs. Burr to talk the matter
over.
Mrs. Burr testified that she had ex
pressed her displeasure at the board, esÂ»
pecially the butter, and also the way in
which the bathroom was kept, and when
she heard that Miss Sturtevant, whom
she designated as the "bouncer" at the
hotel, had been showing her (Mrs. Burr's)
room to a gentleman, she felt annoyed
and spoke to her about it. She was asked
to see Mrs. Geandrot, who was sick in
bed, and acc6rdlngly she went to her bed
room.- Miss Sturtevant was in an ad
joining room with the door open, and Mrs.
de Verna was in the room at the other
side with the door also open, so as to
hear what was going on, and some ladies
stood outside in the hallway. After talk
ing the matter over. Mrs. Geandrot lost
her temper and said Mrs. Burr had been
driven out of the Hotei Lenox, and then
Mrs. Geandrot called Mrs. Burr an offen
sive name. Mrs. Burr retorted that Mrs.
oeandrot was in the position of not being
able to throw stones at her neighbors
in that respect, and then Miss Sturte
vant came in and forcibly ejected Mrs.
Burr. She left the house two days later.
The Judge, after hearing the evidence
of Miss Beatrice Burr, said: "It would
take a Solomon to decide this case. It
appears to be a row among women and
I can't. tell which side is right. As Mrs.
Burr has left the hotel after paying her
bill, I think the best thing I can do is to
dismiss the case."

Company D, League of the Cross Ca
dets, of Sacred Heart Parish, carried off
the honors last night at Mechanics' Pa
vilion in the fifth annual competitive
drill of the First Regiment of that organ
ization. Two other companies competed
for the officers' trophy, A of St. Mary's
Parish and H of St. Brendan's.
The seating capacity of tne Pavilion,
both on the main floor and in the gal
leries, was tested to the full capacity, and
no prettier scene could be imagined than
that presented' when the full regiment,
headed by Casassa's band and the League
of the Cross fife, drum and bugle corps,
made its appearance on the floor and
passed in review before the stand. In
the absence of Major General Shatter,
who was too ill to attend, the regular
army was represented in the reviewing
stand by Captain R. H. Noble of General
Shatter's staff, and Lieutenants R. A.
Brown and T. H. Slavens of the Fourth
Cavalry, who had consented to act as
judges of the drill. Major General Dick
inson and Brigadier General Warfield, of
the .National Guard, and their staffs oc
cupied places of honor in the stand. The
only civilian with them was Mayor Phe
lan. ';' â â '."'â '' Y" ;' '.â¢'â 'â '"
After the review and inspection con
ducted by Major General Dickinson the
regiment marched off and a stirring num
ber by the band filled in the interval be
fore the appearance of Company A on
the floor ready to go through the evolu
tions of the drill prepared for the occa
sion by Colonel Sullivan. When the com
pany did come on, headed by Captain Wil
liam C. Hopper, the cheers showed its
popularity and the presence of a large
crowd of well-wishers, whose hopes of
victory seemed well based as the young
men moved off in the first figures of the
drill.
â¢Before the appearance of the next com
peting company there- was a spectacular
skirmish drill by Company D, Captain
Dwyer, the men in campaign uniform,
followed by an exhibition of the hospital
corps showing the manner of rendering
first aid to the wounded on the field.
Company H of St. Brendan's parish fol
lowed in the effort to capture the prize in
the competition. It was in command of
Captain J. Power and was composed of a
splendid looking lot of young fellows, who
seemed to the manner born. They went
at the work cut out for them as though it
were an everyday matter, and barring a
few bobbles in the beginning seemed to
have struck a. winning gait, which they
maintained to the end, retiring from the
floor to the music of the great bell in the
center of the Pavilion, which had been
set dinging by one of their admirers.
Company G of St. Brlgid's parish, rest
ing on the laurels gained in three preced
ing competitive drills, contented itself
with an exhibition saber drill that was
almost perfection. It cut and slashed to
a man in the most approved style, and
parried and carted and tierced and dug
holes in the pavilion floor with its sabers
until the vast crowd applauded again and
again. Then it was lined up in company
front and the great flag was unfurled
from the roof to its salute.
By this time Company D had donned
its parade dress and was marched past
the stand and lined up for the inspec
tion of the judges before it began what
proved to be the winning movement of
the competition. It was commanded by
Captain I. D. Dwyer, with George H.
Sullivan first,- lieutenant and Vincent Car
roll second lieutenant.. The members of
this company were more youthful look
ing than their competitors, and although
they seemed to possess the grace and con
fidence necessary to carry off the prize,
there were not many who thought they
would. They had not been long at drill
when this doubt was succeeded by a cer
tainty that they "were the people."
It was quite noticeable that movements
that had seemed tame and commonplace
when executed by their predecessors .on
the floor were fairly electrifying when
performed by the boys of D. They put
a vim and a dress and a finish into the
drill that was so soul-satisfying that it
was not necessary for the. last number
to convince nearly everybody present that
the decision would go to the young fel
lows from Sacred Heart parish. They
were so sure of it themselves that when
they marched off they surrounded their
captain and saluted him with dTawn sa
bers and three times three cheers.
Awaiting the decision of the Judges the
entire regiment was assembled, and un
der the command. of Lieutenant Colonel
Thomas F. Ryan marched in parade, at
the conclusion Colonel Sullivan announc
ing that the judges had found in favor of
Company D. The winning command then
marched on and saluted, and Mayor Phe
lan, acting in the stead of Archbishop
Riordan. who was too ill to appear, pinned
the trophy on to the breast of Captain
Dwyer. and the competition was over. The
band played "We Won't Go Home Till
Morning," which some one - remarked
was rather odd for a temperance organi
zation, and everybody made for the cars.
One number was cut from the pro
gramme. This was the mustering in of
the entire regiment as an organization into
the League of the Cross Cadets. So much
time had been taken up by the drill that
It was considered impossible to perform
the ceremony in good season and it was
postponed to another occasion.
EPWORTH LEAGUE CONVENTION
May Come to San Francisco for Its
Next Session.
Extraordinary efforts will be made to
bring the 1901 International Epworth
League Convention to this city, and there
Is every indication that the undertaking
will be a success. Two . committees are
now actively at work in this city
and the other in Los Angelesâ and they
will both have one object in view, and
that is to have the immense gathering
come to California. The local commit
tee met last night in the Young Men's
Christian Association building to formu
late plans and make preliminary arrange-
ments.
The San Francisco committee, consist
ing of Rev. Thomas Filben. D.D., C. B.
Perkins, Robert Husband, XV. H. Waste
and Miss S. E. Powell, at its meeting laat
night decided to begin active work to se
cure the convention for this State, and a
sub-committee was appointed to confer
with the municipal and commercial bodies
and invoke their aid in the movement. It
was stated that $25,000, necessary for the
proper entertainment of the visiting dele
gates, will be forthcoming and has all
been. practically subscribed.
The- committee, which has established
headquarters in the Y. M. C. A. building
in this city, has full power to act, and it
will be backed by the State, district and
city organizations. The campaign will in
volve the consultation and capture of the
leaders of the league In the United States
and Canada. The railroad companies,
recognizing the benefits of the Christian
Endeavor convention held here in 1897,
are co-operating with the committee, and
have guaranteed a â  low rate. It is ex
pected that there will be as many people
brought here in 1901 as in'lS97.

Police Officer/Bakulich, the Sandow of
the department, had an exciting experi
ence in Los Gatos several days, ago. Be
ing taken for a "bad man" he was held
up at the point of a pistol and was threat
ened with death if iie made any resist
ance. iTA;.?
Convinced that the man at the "other
end of the gun" meant business Baku
lich knocked him down and after a short
struggle succeeded in disarming him.
Bakulich promptly handcuffed his assail
ant and took him to the railroad depot,
where he turned him over to the con
stable.
As fiakulich's prisoner was bleeding
from the nose the Constable also took the
police officer into custody. At the . City
Jail they were both charged with battery.
Bakulich fortunately had $10 with him
and he was released. Several farmers,
thinking Bakulich had assaulted the other
defendant without provocation, gathered
about the jail determined to wreak venge
ance on the "bully," as they termed
him. The Constable, after learning that
Bakulich was a San Francisco police of
ficer, apologized for his mistake, and ad
dressing the revengeful farmers who
were gathering about the jail, informed
them that the "fellow was all right."
"He's a copper from Frisco," explained
the Constable. "The other fellow tried to
put it on him, but he got the worst of it."
Bakulich was then allowed to depart,
after notifying the Constable that he
would rather forfeit his $10 than stay in
town another day.
Bakulich, when seen last night, said: "I
was on my vacation, and not having any
place- to go. agreed to accompany my
friend, E. Chiclovich, of 2217 Fillmore
street, to Los Gatos. Chielovich is the
owner of some Los Gatos property, which
is being unlawfully held by a man named
T. N. Whitehead. He is the man with
whom I had the trouble. Some time, ago,
so Chielovich claims, Whitehead attacked
him and nearly choked him to death.
Chielovich determined to compel White
head to move his belongings from the
property and asked me to assist him. We
went to Los Gatos and posted a number
of notices announcing that the property
was for sale. After we had left the place
and were on our way to the railroad sta
tion Whitehead appeared and proceeded
to assault Chielovich. I told him to desist
and he made a blow at me. I seized him
and in the struggle he tore off my neck
tie. Just then he drew a revolver and,
placing it against my breast, threatened
to make me a subject for the Coroner. I
thought he meant what he said, so
I struck him in the face and knocked him
down. I then disarmed him and after
handcuffing him took him to the railroad
station, where we were both placed under
arrest.
"Whitehead evidently took me for a
bully, for when he accosted me he re
marked that even if Chielovich had a
bodyguard he could lick both of us. I
did not anticipate any trouble in Los
Gatos or I would not have consented to
accompany my friend Chielovich.
"Rather than lay over for another day
to be tried I notified the Constable that
he could forfeit my ball."

THE PANHANDLE EXTENSION.
THE project for the extension of the beautiful
entrance to the Golden Gate Park to Market
street has fairly attracted public attention, and
the more it is considered the better are the prospects
for its success. When popular interest in such an
improvement has once been excited the battle is half
won. because each day's consideration of its merits
develops new reasons for its indorsement, whether
it be regarded from an esthetic or from a utilitarian
point of view.
The citizens of San Francisco are justly proud of
their great park, which ha's not only proved a local
attraction and exerted a most beneficial influence
upon the community, but has won the admiration of
American and foreign visitors till its praises have
been sounded throughout the world. But, though
excellent and disinterested management and artistic
skill have already wrought wonders by the conver
sion of a barren solitude into a scene of bewildering
and variegated beauty, it must be remembered that
the work inconstantly in progress and is not half
done. It will be many years before the marvelous
picture now spreading over the shifting sands that
fringe the Pacific Ocean is completed. When it- lias
stretched almost to the edge of the spent breakers
that through every gradation from soothing murmurs
to angry wars illustrate the attracting moods of the.
great deep, it will be simply incomparable. So far
as we are advised there is no large city on this con
tinent or in Europe that can thus concentrate the
most exquisite phases of nature upon a combined
national and municipal boundary, which, it may be
observed, marking the Western limit of this repub
lic, connects the highest development of fraternity on
the land with that vaster fraternity of the sea, where
governments as well as men are equal in right and
equal in opportunity.
The creation of Golden Gate Park has already
stimulated the liberality of opulent citizens to an ex
tent that will be felt morally and intellectually for cen
turies. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the lavish
gifts of money that have aided the labors of the Park
Commissioners. But, when the invitation to this
educational and sanitary opportunity is extended to
the heart of our metropolis, and the toiling thousands
of our industrial population inhale the soliciting
breath of restful and purifying nature almost at their
doors, the response will be so general and so con
stant that local munificence will search the globe for
new attractions to perfect its relations with appre
ciative humanity.
There are utilitarian views of the panhandle ex
tension that should not be overlooked. The con
demnation of land and buildings tor the new boule
vard will put a large amount of money in circulation
and furnish employment for many laborers and ar
tisans. The improvement itself will also enhance the
value of residence property over a large and impor
tant section of the municipality. This branch of the
subject will require further elaboration. But at pres
ent it is sufficient to observe that the pressure of
sound public opinion is rapidly silencing ultra
conservative opposition. When capital and labor are
united in the advocacy of a wise public expenditure
the combination is irresistible.
An unexpected gleam of intelligence has at last
shot through the heads of the Piute Indians who. are
holding high carnival on the Pyramid Lake reser
vation. The Piutes can stand almost anything in the
way of imposition, but they have rebelled unani
mously against bookmakers on horse races.
The highbinders of Chinatown are sharpening their
hatchets for new victims. Fifty Chinese gambling
dens are in almost open operation. The Celestial lot
tery dealers are plying their trade with renewed
energy. Recent police reforms in the district. seem to
have acted as an inspiration.
The authorities at Washington are inclined to treat
â¢lightly the stoning of the American Consul at
.Manaos as Brazil is very friendly with the United
States. Perhaps the injured Consul entertains an
opinion that there are some case* where one ought to
he protected from his friends.
The Populists are taking steps to prevent losing
themselves in the next national campaign. With a
hope that they may be found somewhere after elec
tion day they have repudiated, all allegiance to the
cause of William Jennings Bryan. - * -;
SAN FRANCISCO AND DEWEY.
SAN FRANCISCO will have a monument to
Dewey, and it will be of a character sufficiently
noble and artistic to rank among the best ex-
amples of American monumental architecture of our
time. That much appears well assured by the re-
sponse which the public has given to the suggestion
of The Call that the erection of the monument should
be undertaken.
As was to have been expected, the proposal bf the
enterprise has been followed at once by considerations
as to where it shall be placed. That, however, is a
matter that can be postponed for a time. The choice
of site will form a part of the artistic problem of de-
signing the monument, for the one of course must
be appropriate to the other. All in due time these
matters will be considered, and the decision, it can
hardly be doubted, will be satisfactory to the con- j
tributors to the fund and to the general public.
It is to be noted that every one who has given the j
subject the consideration it merits recognizes the fit- j
ness of making San Francisco the place where Dewey's
victory is to receive its most enduring memorial and
the hero himself his most notable monument. More-
over, all concede that it will be far better for Cali-
formians to contribute to the erection of a monument
here than to the purchase of a mansion at Washing-
ton. The monument will be essentially a manifesta
tion of Western loyalty and will be a heritage of]
the people for centuries to come, while the Washing- :
ton mansion will but scantily represent the West, and,
moreover, will have nothing of the nature of an en-
during memorial.
Now that .the movement has been started and is j
under the direction of an able committee appointed
jby the Mayor, the next thing is to carry it forward
with a speed sufficient to generate enthusiasm as it
goes. The time is propitious to the undertaking. It
is but a year since the great victory was won, and j
every incident of the glorious triumph is fresh in the
minds of all. We have but recently celebrated with
an exuberant joy and loyalty the festival of Dewey j
day. and the ardor of the occasion has hardly yet
passed away. The public mind, therefore, may be
said to be already attuned to the enterprise, and its \
responsiveness when rightly appealed to will be
found cordial, prompt and generous.
The standard of excellence to be attained by the
monument should be set high. Nothing commonplace
or of an insignificant size will do. Dewey's victory
opens before San Francisco a broad pathway to com-
mercial empire over the greatest of the oceans of the
earth. That path has been opened at a time when the
Pacific is beginning to be the field of the greatest
activity of the expanding energies of the nations. It
made this republic known as a world power and one
that from this time forth is to be reckoned with in all |
questions affecting Pacific Ocean affairs. So great
an achievement cannot be fitly marked by a monu-
"*
mental structure of anything less than the highest
order.
WHAT IS TREASON?
THE question again becomes pertinent. The
constitution defines treason, but in such a way
as to leave the freedom of discussion untouched.
American citizens have always been free to discuss
public policies, because it is only by such discussion
that the foundations of the Government can be main
tained. When the Spanish war was undertaken to
remove the obstacles presented by Spanish sov
ereignty to the desire of millions of people to be free,
no one dreamed of any change in the institutions or
purposes of this republic.
The struggle for independence in Cuba began in
1895. The national platforms of 1896 dealt with it
from a strictly and praiseworthy American stand
point. The Republican platform said: "From the
hour of achieving their own independence the peo
ple of the United States have regarded with sympathy
the struggles of the other American peoples to free
themselves from European domination. We watch
with deep and abiding interest the heroic battle of
the Cuban patriots against cruelty and oppression, and
our best hopes go out for the full success of their de
termined contest for liberty."
The Populist national convention declared: "We
tender to the patriotic people of Cuba our deepest
sympathy in their heroic struggle lor political free
dom and independence, and we believe the time has
come when the United States, the great republic of
the world, should recognize that Cuba is. and of right
ought to be, a free and independent state."
The Democratic, platform said: "We extend our
sympathy to the people of Cuba in their heroic strug
gle for liberty and independence."
Those expressions represented the sentiments of the
whole people. They were uttered in a spirit of devo
tion to our own institutions, and in a certain sense
were boastful of our own position as the citizens of
a country in which Government derives its just
powers from the consent of the governed. The very
language of some of those platform pledges was
taken from the heroic declaration of Thomas Paine
when he ended the intercession of the colonies at the
feet of George 111 by that bold speech, 'These colo
nies are. and of right ought to be, free and indepen
dent States."
There is no room for disputing that the American
people intended those platform pledges to apply
everywhere, in the East Indies as weir as in the West,
and any proposition to limit their application to one
place and apply the monarchical principles of impe
rialism in another place would have, been hotly re
sisted and beaten in any of the three national con
ventions.
Surely it is a startling fact that our imperialists are
now daily denouncing the spirit of those platforms
as "treason" and those who adhere to those pledges
as ''traitors."
We have preferred to abide by the American policy
and stand for that highest Americanism which ani
mated all political parties in 1896. If to stand fast
in that Spirit and purpose is treason^ by what term
can we characterize the expressions of the im
perialists?
One of them declares the Federal constitution out
grown and no longer worth discussing. Mr. Reid,
one of the negotiators of the Paris treaty, says: "It
is time to begin teaching the American people the
absurdity of. that clause in the Declaration of Inde
pendence which derives all the just powers of govern
ment from the consent of the governed." The Rev.
Dr. P. S. Benson says: "As to that hallowed docu
ment that declares that all governments derive their
just powers from the consent of the governed/if that
is to be literally construed, there never was a greater
lie palmed of! by the devil upon a credulous world."
The list of these imperialistic expressions can .be in
definitely extended. The form varies but little. Their
spirit is one of active revolt against -the -restraints
and limitations of the Federal constitution and of
most contemptuous repudiation of the principles of
the Declaration of Independence. One is justly
amazed at the large number of men who take this
position. They ask the- country to indorse them, to
affirm their views, and they denounce opposition as
unpatriotic and treasonable. All this brings in- sight
a very disquieting situation. If the patriotic "declara
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, SATURDAY, MAY 20, 1899. '
tions of the three political parties in 1896 are patriotic
no longer, and if government by consent of the gov
erned is a devilish lie, when the men who hold these
views achieve power the republic will have reversed
itself. Government will then be held to derive its
powers.: from the will of those who govern, and self
government will have perished from the earth. X *
Though we stood alone we propose to deny now
j and for all time the thesis of imperialism. We deny
j that the constitution is obsolete and the Declaration
iof Independence a lie. We deny that what was pa
j triotic three years ago is unpatriotic now, and we
( warn those who manage parties to avoid identifica
tion with these imperialist denunciations of Ameri
i can principles.
THE SPIRIT OF TRUE CITIZENSHIP
UNDER the title of "Civic Pride" Herbert E.
Law contributes to the Merchants' Association
Review a notably strong article on the nature
of the public spirit necessary to make San Francisco
great and prosperous. "Civic pride," he says, "seems
to be the one thing lacking among our business men
and newspaper men in many instances." His argu
ment is that we scold too much, that harping on evils
does not cure them. On the contrary, such self
denunciations do harm, for they are scattered far and
wide and give the city a bad reputation abroad. He
says:
"What we should do is to talk about the city, its
prospects and its possibilities. We want to dream
about them. We want to read about them. We
want to have them constantly before us and to tell of
them so firmly, so often and so well, that we. shall
make converts. We want to gather people to us, and,
with them, work out a great destiny for the city. As
to the disadvantages and the difficulties we have here,
there has never been a city of any note in the United
States that has had as few as San Francisco. Stop
and think for a moment of the tremendous disadvan
tage under which Chicago labored. It is within the
memory of man when the best part of Chicago could
not be given away. Cities, like other things, are what
people make them. We have every reason to be
enthusiastic over the future of San Francisco. It is
destined to be the center of the greatest traffic of all
the commercial cities of the Union."
There is much in the policy proposed that is attrac
â¢ tive, and no doubt there is considerable wisdom un
derlying it. It is well that a people should not infre
quently take notice and account of their advantages
and their excellencies and make them known to
others. Optimism not infrequently stimulates energy
, and encourages industry to greater efforts. It is al
ways productive of cheerfulness, and that in itself goes
a long way toward advancing the fortunes cither of
individuals or of communities, for it not only
strengthens the endeavors of the worker, but it wins
friends.
Nevertheless Mr. Law is hardly justified in treating
those who point out the evils of the city as persons
| lacking in civic pride or patriotism. An abuse that
'is never denounced will never be cured. Nor is it
correct to assume that the denunciations of such of-
fenses injure us abroad. Ship-owners : and sea-
tains, for example, do not need us to tell them
about the shipping facilities of San Francisco and of
the port charges. They are well aware of all our de-
fects. Saying nothing about them will not cure them,
j and, Mr. Law to the contrary notwithstanding*, harp-
ing on them has a tendency to do so. .We are in-
deed reforming by degrees the evils among us, and
may eventually remove them all. but we will never
do so by any process of boasting of the city or brag
: ging of ourselves.
THE DREYFUS CASE.
IT is now expected that the Dreyfus case will be
decided by the French Court of Cassation early in
June. There are few disinterested men who have
j followed the investigation without being led to a be-
lief in his innocence. It is demonstratively proved
j that his. conviction was procured by shameless frauds,'
: and that his protracted incarceration on Devils Island
I is a reproach to the republic of France.
It is useless now critically to examine the addi
tional evidence that has been received and published.
Much of it is cumulative. As a whole it is so con
clusive that it cannot be overborne by any combi
nation of military and political influence. The find
nation of military and political influence. The find
ing that Dreyfus was guilty must certainly be quashed,
and it does not appear that any retrial can be justified.
A singular phase of this extraordinary case is re-
vealed by a recent publication in which Canon Delas-
sus of Cambrai, in France, complained that Dreyfus
had received moral support in the United States, for
which he held the American Catholic church respon
sible. France is nominally a republic, and yet this
learned Frenchman is totally unable to comprehend
the formation and the expression of public opinion in
a country where there is a complete separation be-
tween church and state, and where, by constitutional
elimination, bigotry and intolerance are practically
impossible. Millions of Americans of all parties and
creeds, Catholic and Protestant alike, have considered
1 the Dreyfus case and have believed that he was a vie-
tim of fraud and of military oppression. They live
under a form of government limited to secular ob-
jects, under which man is invested with inalienable
rights, and among them that of being presumed to be
innocent of crime until proved to be guilty by reliable
and competent testimony. In the case of Dreyfus
they saw that he had been made a scapegoat by
French officers connected with the general staff of
the army, and that, by fabricated evidence, he had
been subjected to cruel and undeserved punishment.
The question of his nationality or his religion was
not even an element in their consideration of. the
facts. Equality before the law, fair and open trial,
freedom from concocted persecutions, judgment rest*
ing upon truth and upon principle, arc the preroga
tives of every human being in the United States, citi-
zen or alien, barbarian or civilized, Jew or Gentile,
i Pagan or Christian.
American citizenship, therefore, without distinction
of race, party or creed, resents tyranny and injustice,
no matter what the pretexts or the sophistries in-
volved to justify them. It inquires only into the case
itself, when its intelligence and its manhood are en-
listed by such conditions as surrounded the trial and
the exile of Dreyfus. It condemns persecutions in
America, in Russia, in Germany, in Ireland, in
France â wherever humanity exists.
The attack of Canon Dclassus upon the American
Catholic church, using the phrase in which >'. he
groups together our Catholic fellow citizens, was not
only unwarrantable but evidently grew out of his
total inability to separate questions of government
from questions of race or of religion. It was simi
lar to the virulent criticisms by Dr. Zahn of Arch-
bishop Ireland, whose patriotism has been so deeply
| recognized in this country, who has been so de
; servedly and so signally honored by Pope Leo XIII,
and whose recent address upon Joan of Arc was
| among the notable productions of the century. The
; indignation of Washington churchmen, so forcibly
expressed, will be shared by American citizens gen-
erally, who regard the separation of church and state
as a fundamental necessity and who believe that po-
I litical liberty is best subserved by religious neutrality.

The Attorney for the Corporation
Backs Up His Contention With
a Clear Explanation of
the Law.
The controversy between the Board
of Supervisors and the Spring Valley
Water Company over the payment of
the company's bill for water furnished
the city during the month of March
has been finally settled and the com
pany will get the full amount of its
claim. It was alleged that during the
past five years the water company had
charged foe water furnished the whole
of Alta Plaza, when, as a matter of
fact, only half of the plaza has been
under cultivation. It was claimed that
these overcharges amounted to $6110 92,
and an attempt Was. made to deduct
this amount from the March bill.
The matter was referred to the Com
mittee on Water and Water Supply for
investigation and was taken up for con
sideration at the meeting of the com
mittee held yesterday morning. Edward
Deady, ex-gardener of Alta Plaza, was
called as a witness and testified that
during the years 1897 and 1898 no-water
was used on the unimproved portion
of the park. He admitted that mains
and pipes were in place and the water
ready for use, but could not remember
but orfe or two instances when it had
been used. It developed, however, that
in the latter part of 1894 the city let
a contract for the grading and improv
ing of that portion of the plaza now in
dispute and that water was used by
tho contractor for a year thereafter.
George E. Booker, chief clerk for the?
water company, said water had been
us* on the disputed portion of the
plaza during the greater portion of
the period covered by the alleged over
charges. He also said that not until
the park was under cultivation did the
company put in its bill to the city. He
stated that it was a general rule with
him never to make any charge until
a place as under cultivation.
Supervisor Bylngton asked Mr.
Booker if he could tell -what amount
of water had been used In Alta Plaza
from October, 1594, to the present time,
but Mr. Booker was unable to enlight
en him. He did say he had seen the
water used, but added that he did not
think the park was kept up in very
good condition.
The chief clerk informed the com
mittee that the bills of his company
had frequently been voluntarily re
duced. He said the water company had
charged the city at a low rate so as to
keep within the one-twelfth act, as it
could not afford to come before the
board and have its bills tied up, as
such a course would result in the com
pany losing a part or even the whole
of the amount of its bills. He also
said the company was making Its
charges less than they should be if the
legal rates were charged in every in
stance.
Mr. Booker testified that he lived in
the vicinity of Alta Plaza and watched
its progress. He was positive the water
had been used.
At the conclusion of Chief Clerk
Booker's statement Attorney Kellogg,
representing the water company, said.
"The. evidence shows conclusively
that water was supplied to the entire
Alta Plaza Park In 1894 and that for
nearly a year- it was continuously used
by the city in irrigating that park.
Afterward the city used the water on
tho disputed half of the park and never
from the time water was turned on
by the company until the month of
March. 1899, did the city ever- orally
or in writing notify the company that
it was not using or did not desire to
use the water. And the company did
not know until March of this year that
the city desired to discontinue Its use.
"Even then" the authorities desired
the water to remain on the unused por
tion of the park, but requested that the
amount be deducted from their bills.
This was immediately done and has
since been done.
"All the bills from 1894 to March, 1899,
were audited and approved by the
proper committee of the board; and by
the board and the city officers, and
paid. This was done after the very
question now under discussion had been
thoroughly investigated by the preced
ing board, acting under the advice of
City and County Attorney Creswell,
which I will' read to you. - It is as fol
lows:
Liability of city and county to be.
charged for water when* notice to dis-
continue supply has not been given.
February 9, 1895.
To the Board of Supervisors: I am
in receipt of the communication of the
joint committee on judiciary and
finance of the board dated January
29, 1895, asking my opinion of the lia
bility of the city and county for the
charge of $723 50 of the Spring Valley :''
Water Works for water supplied In
the month of December, 1894, for pub-
lie squares and parks. The charge
was made under resolution No. 10,049
(third series!, adopted by the Board of
Supervisors March .12, 1894, which is
the present water ordinance.
I do not of my own knowledge know
whether or not water belonging to the
Spring Valley Water Works had been
prior ; to December, 1894, supplied by
that company to the city a,nd county
for the irrigation of the public squares
and parks by means of pipes or other-
wise extending into the same, and if
so, whether the -water was in Decem
ber, 1894, ready for the use of the city
and county for that purpose at ' the
pleasure of- its employe,-.
I will assume, however, that such is
the case, and that prior to December
1894. the city and county had been us-
ing the same.
There is a general rule of law. sup-
ported by decisions too numerous to
cite, that "a sale is perfected by de
'-. livery when . the property is so situ-
ated that the purchaser is entitled to
and can rightfully take possession of
it at his pleasure."
Benjamin on Sales, 3d Am. Ed., sec
, 679, cases cited. .: . ...
Means vs. Williamson, 37 Me. 556
If. then, according to this rule of
law, the water had been delivered by]
the Spring Valley Water Works In
December. 1894, upon the public
squares and parks for the use of the
city and county for irrigation, and was
so : situated that the city and county
was entitled to and could < rightfully
. take possession of it at pleasure, then
. the sale of it to the city and county â 
was complete, and the cost . of the
same at the established rates Is a
legal charge against the city and
county. '-â¢-â ' .*-.'
- No. 10,049 is the present
water ordinance of the Board of Su
pervisors.
Section 14 of this resolution requires
in effect, that all consumers shall give
; notification to the company in writing
to cut off or dicontinue the water sud-
ply upon the premises of the consum
er, when there Is an intention to dis-
continue the use thereof, "after
â which," in the language* of the section,
"no charge shall be made for water
for said premises until the use of wa
ter is resumed." ."â  â  _,
If this section refers to the muni-
cipal corporation of the city and coun
ty of San Francisco, as well as to all
private corporations and natural per-
sons, then, * before a charge for the
water in December, 1894, could be de-
feated, it would have been necessary
for the city and county to have given
the company the notice therein re-
quired. - , ,
In this ordinance is found frequent
mention of the City and County of San
Francisco. .V , .
For instance, the first sentence pro-
vides, among other things, for monthly
rates or compensation to be collected
hv any person, companay or corpora-
tion engaged in the business of sup-
plying water * * â¢ for muni-
cipal uses, and for all public purposes
'of the city and county of San l' ran-
cisco; and section 11 provides the rates
of compensation to be collected for
water supplied by and through hy
drants to the city and county of San
Francisco; and section 13 provides that .
all water rates, except meter rates
and city and county rates, are due and
payable monthly in advance, and that
meter and city and county rates are
due and payable at the end of each
month. , ._.â_!_
These citations show conclusively
that the Board of Supervisors in pass-
ing resolution No. 10,049, recognized
that the municipal corporation 01 the
city and county of San Francico would
be a purchaser and consumer or water
under that ordinance. ââ¢___ â¢
Section 14. as I have shown, requires
notice of discontinuance to be given
by consumers. It applies to all con-
sumers alike; it does not say, and
there can be no reason why it should
have said, that natural persons who
were consumers of water should M
burdened with this requirement while
public and private corporations should
not be. . . IC-,',
The only foundation for an argu
ment that this section does not apply
to public and private corporations as
well as natural persons is the use
therein of the personal pronoun his
The use of this word does not limit
the application of this section to
natural persons. Even had the word
"person" been used instead of the
word "consumer." the section would
have applied to public and private cor
j porations as well as to natural per-
sons. . â _,"_''â '"_ ._
It has been repeatedly held by the
courts of last resort in the United
' States that "when persons are men-
tioned in a statute corporations are in-
eluded if they fall within the general
reason and design of the statute.
(Angell and Ames on Corporations,
sees. 6, 193, 265, 271, 407 a. 441. 458.)
The application of the "person
to corporations Is recognized by the
Codes of California, sec. 14, Civil Code.
I am therefore of the opinion that if
the Spring Valley Water Works sup-
plied water to the city and county so
that the same could be used for the-
irrigation of the public squares and
parks at the pleasure of the employe's
of the city and county entrusted with
that duty, and that the city and
county gn,ve no notice to discontinue
the use of the water for the month
of December, 1896, the city and county
is legally liable for water for that
month at the rate established by Res-
olution No. 10,049 C^lrdCserlesV. â¢
HARRY T. CRESWELL,
Attorney and Counselor.
"This doctrine," Mr. Kollogg con
tinued, "has been maintained by every
court where the question has arisen
and it has been universally recognized
by the municipal authorities here since
it was enunciated by Mr. Creswell. It
also is apparent from the testimony of
the gardener as well as Mr. Booker
that the city has used the water as
occasion required. It is therefore not
legal nor equitable in view of the doc
trines stated in the opinion and in view
of the facts, that the present board
should attempt to review acts of their
predecessors which had been not only
adjudicated but completed in accord
ance -with the doctrines of the board.
"Payments have been made and ac
cepted and receipts passed in full
knowledge of the existing circumstan
ces. There was, therefore, no error
whatever from any point of view in the
bills -which had been presented and
paid and no right vested in this present
board to review such acts of their pre
decessors as had become functus officio.
When it was admitted, as it must be,
that the claims of the company had
been properly presented and paid and
that they were just and proper, I stand
ready, not as a matter of right upon
the part of the municipality, but for the
sake of avoiding further disputes and
delays and for the purpose of closing
up the business of the fiscal year in
due time, to deduct from the June bill
the amount in dispute. I do this be
cause there would be a deficiency in
the general fund and because I desire
no further disputes or delays In the
payment of the already accrued hills
and the bills to accrue between now
and the fiscal year. - It must be dis
tinctly understood, however, that this
was not done as an admission of any
right on the part of the city, but with
a constant denial of that right and the
assertion fully sustained by the facts
and the law, that all the bills of the
company have been correct and legal."
The committee deemed this offer to
be a fair one and so accepted it. A
recommendation will be made to the
board on Monday that {he full amount
of the disputed claim be paid.

An Amicable Contention at Law' In-
volving an. Intricate Point and
a Large Sum of
Money.
It is not every day that people can b^
found with courage enough to refuse Â«_f
legacy of 1100,000, no matter how arduous
the conditions attached. Still there are
some In this city, the trustees of St. Ig
natius College being among the number.
Under the will of the late Mrs. Annie
Donahue, widow of Peter Donahue, there
was left to them the sum of $100,000 to be
used in founding ahd supporting for the
benefit of Catholic young men a library,
to be called in memory of her husband
the Donahue library. At a recent meet
ing of the college trustees it was de
cided to reject the bequest for the reason
that under its terms no provision was
made for the payment of salaries and
other incidental expenses of the library
which the trustees did not feel they could
undertake.
Archbishop Riordan, who naturally took
a great deal of interest in such an insti
tution, seeing that it was in his arch
diocese that the benefits of the library
would be most generally felt, learned with
regret of the rejection of the legacy. He
decided if possible that the institution
should be founded, and to that end he
has asked the courts to substitute him
self as trustee, in plage of those named .
In the bequest, signifying his willingness
to carry out Its provisions and erect and
maintain the libracy for Catholic young
men. . â¢ ,
The application has just been presented
in the Superior Court by the Attorney
General on the relation of the Arch
bishop. It will be heard next Friday be
fore Superior Judge Troutt. when ex-At
torney General Fitzgerald and Robert Y.
Havne will appear in support of the ap
plication, and John Garber and Barclay
Henley, representing the heirs and de-^jA
visees under the will, will resist it.
This resistance of the heirs and de
visees to the application of the Arch
bishop is understood to be entirely
friendly and undertaken only with a de
sire to have the matter forever adjusted
by the court. Taking this position, the
heirs contend that ft is apparent from
the face of the will that Mrs. Donahue
appointed the college trustees by reason
of the personal trust and confidence she
had in their efficiency as educators and
upon their known character and ability
to administer this kind of a trust.
The Attorney General takes the ground
that the Archbishop, having been ap
pointed a trustee for the distribution of
1100.000 in charity under another provision
of the will, and being the official resi
dent head of all things Catholic in the
State; is naturally the trustee to be se
lected to carry out the will of the de
ceased in repaid to a Catholic library
after the rejection of the office by the
trustees first appointed.
The question at issue is one of consid
erable interest to attorneys, involving as
it uoes the principle of cy pres (law
French), meaning "as near as" â that is,
in this case to carry out as closely as pos
sible the intention of the testatrix. This
intention, .the relator holds, was for the
founding of a library alone, the appoint
ment of trustees being merely an inci
dental matter.

THE Endeavorers are now in active
session. Work is the keynote of
the active Christians, and for the
moment ill hospitable intentions
are put aside and the business of
the convention is being strictly ad
hered to. "After the routine of the three
days' session pleasure will be In order,
and for next week a series of delights has
been carefully planned.
The steamer Piedmont has been char
tered for Sunday and the Endeavorers
will take a trip on the bay. Tuesday will
be given over to scaling the heights of
grim old ramalpais. Santa Cruz and the
big trees will fill in the pleasures of
Wednesday, and on Thursday a visit to
Santa Rosa will be in order. Friday will
bring the festivities to a close with a
"basket lunch" at Haywards.
The work of the Endeavorer begins
early. At a quarter before R Rev. XV. C.
Sherman of the Fourteenth-street Pres
byterian Church at Sacramento opened
to-day's session with "The Quiet Morning
Hour"." an Impressive service of song,
prayer and Scripture res ling. R. W.
Venn of Santa Paula in a "Chalk Talk
followed. A number of hymns were then
sung under tho leadership of E. Mere

After the committees were disposed of
the State officers and superintendents

pense of tho music of his 'verse. E. 11.
' Baker's paper, "The Quiet Hour," was an
earnest plea for the prayer that is made
in the closet and the good deeds done In
secret. A. XV. Bell followed with "Good
Literature" and made an earnest plea for "
the spread of the highest and best 'read-
; ing. L. T. Hatfield, in his reflection on
"Temperance and Citizenship." urged all
1 to "carry their church principles to the
polls."
Lester B. Smith, State chairman on
transportation, who. according to Presi-
dent -Lowell, "is in with the Southern
, Pacific, but does not wear the collar,"
1 gave a graphic description of how he got
the Endeavorers to Oakland. Mr. Smith
explained that all credit was not duo to
' himself only, but to the wideawake En-
deavorers all over the State.
State Treasurer J. A. Mil. presented
his yearly report. It showed cash on

whole with a dash of contagious humor.
President Lowell was the last officer on
' the morning programme, and he expressed
his, gratitude to the Endeavorers for their
kindness to him and for their spirit of
harmony and co-operation.
Reports were received from the county
i unions of Shasta. San Joaquin, Solano.
Siskiyou, Sacramento. Orange, Santa
Cruz. Sonoma, Napa and San Francisco.
Mrs. Edmund Taylor of Oakland, the
I only lady on the programme, read a' pretty
paper on "His light on the Seas."
Mrs Taylor has had much personal ex-
perience with sailors and declared that

, than the world thinks him.
The morning session closed with the

When the Rev. J. H. McCollough of the

THE SAN FltAlS CISCO CAM.. SATURDAY, MAY 20, 1899.
First Congregational Church, San Fran
cico, brought comfort to -many restless
spirits. Dr. Adams answered the many
puzzling, perplexing questions aptly and
satisfactorily.
Dr. Clark, the reverend founder of the
order, followed, speaking on "The Quiet
Hour." Dr. Clark in convincing phrase
spoke of the "fifteen minutes alone with
God" and dilated' upon the wonderful
blessing of communing with the Maker.
W. G. Alexander's address. "What Aye
Owe to Our Intermediates and Juniors,
was filled with noble thoughts and con
tained an earnest plea to save the "Jun
ior" from drifting away. "Many Jun
iors," Mr. Alexander explained, "when
they reach the years between 14 and 20
feel they are too old for Juniors and too
Weak to "grapple with the earnest pur
poses of the Seniors. We must keep them
from drifting from out the circle of good
influences, and that Is the especial work
of the Intermediates."
Tho Chinese children from the San
Francisco mission interrupted for a pleas
ant moment the solemnity of the proceed
ings, and in childish treble sang hymns of
praise and patriotic songs.
Rev. F. B. Cherlngton of the Plymouth
Congregational Church told of the "Mis
sion of Christian Literature," and happily
commended the fact that the horrible,
realistic fin-de-siecle literature was
doomed to perish and the good works,
such as "Pilgrim's Progress" and the
works of Thomas a Kempis destined to
live forever.
After a prayer and benediction by Rev.

The evening session of the convention
was largely devotional. Like last night
the big hall was packed, and the police
earned many unkind looks for its enforce
ment of the ordinance' providing that all
aisles and exits be kept clear. Rev. _. A.
Woods, D.D., of the First Baptist Church
of San Francisco, delivered a short ser
mon, dealing with the responsibilities of
Christian Endeavorers.
Rev. "Father" Clark, whose presence Is
always the signal for a salute, spoke from
the subject "Detroit, '99." He reminded
the convention that the national gather
ing of the society was to be held in De
troit in July, and that California send as
large a delegation as possible, as all the
States were anxious to return the gener
osity shown by California in '97 at the
San Francisco convention. The speaker
dwelt at length upon the need of En
deavorers abiding by the pledge required
of them to do their whole duty to God
and man. He advised them not to be car
ried away by enthusiasm and ostentation,
but to follow closely the vocation to
which they were called.
Rev. C. Pierce of Los Angeles dealt with
the subject ''Giving' to God." and "Oppor
tunity" was the theme of Rev. G. C. Ad
ams of San Francisco. The latter speaker
said that the true creed of all Christian
Endeavor was embraced in his text. The
opportunity was at hand, the 'fields are
white unto harvest and the world looks
to the Endeavorers to gather In the
sheaves. *
The session was brought to a close with
a prayer and benediction by Rev. J. c.
Edwards of the Los Angeles African M.

.ANOTHER CHAPTER IN BTJBNS'
ANOTHER CHAPTER IN BURNS'
RECORD AS A DEFAULTER.
A. L. Hart's Claim for Legal Services
Is Settled by Arbitration With
Colonel Wright as
Arbitrator.
Governor Gage is expected in San Fran- i
cisco to-day to attend the cornerstone ,
ceremonies at the College of Physicians ;
and Surgeons. Hearing that he had ac
cepted an Invitation to meet the physi
cians many of the politicians surmised !
that the appointments to the Board of
Health -would either be announced or i
plainly indicated before the Governor left I
the city for Los Angeles. In expectation
of the Governor's arrival from Sacra- !
mento many of the applicants for official I
favor went to the Palace court last even- '
ing. but they did not meet the executive.
There are many subordinate positions !
In tho field on inspection connected with ;
the Health Department or this city, hence j
unusual interest is manifested. The Gov- j
ernor is blamed for delay in naming the â 
new board, but his friends say that Gov- \
ernor Budd did not appoint the Health
Board until in the month of June.
An officeholder who Is supposed to he ln
the confidence of Burns and McLaughlin
expressed the opinion last night atÂ» the
Palace that DO one but Gage had the
slightest knowledge as to the accepted
Board of Health slate. A month ago the
insiders believed that the selections had
been finally made, but since the extreme
pressure had been brought to bear on the
Governor to Induce him to recognize an
active local element of the party that was
not considered when the original slate
was made.
It is now understood that members of
the executive committee of the â¢ Repub- ;
lican State Central Committee, who were
not known in the Senatorial contest at
Sacramento as active supporters of D. M. j
Burns, will make no further suggestions
to Governor Gage concerning the distri- i
bution of patronage.
The appointments made by the Governor
since the conference, at the Palace Hotel, :
which was called ostensibly to strengthen
and harmonize the party, convince all j
who were not In the Burns crowd that it
la utterly useless to make any suggestions
to Gage.
Another chapter in the record of Burns*
defalcation in office is closed. A. L. Hart,
who defended D. M. Burns In the courts
of Yolo and Sacramento, where embez
zlement proceedings were instituted,
sought subsequently to collect $2">,000 for
legal services rendered the accused. D.
M. Burns paid (2000 on account, but re
fused to pay the full amount of Hart's
fee.
When the Senatorial contest opened at
Sacramento the lawyer fancied that the
time was opportune for demanding final
settlement. The ex-Secretary of State
saw at once . that refusal to entertain
propositions might reopen the old scan- ;
dal and bring to light some phases of
the embezzlement of public funds which
would affect his candidacy for the United
States Senate. ln order, therefore, to
suppress scandal, arbitration was sug- j
gested. It appears that Burns and Hart
agreed on Colonel J. B. Wright of the
Southern Pacific Company as arbitrator. I
In due time Colonel Wright submitted a
report, in which he decided that D. M. '
Burns should pay A. 1.. Hart $1500. This J
sum, which Burns has now 'paid, added
to a previous payment of 0000, makes
Mart's fee for defending Burns $3500. In
accordant with the arbitrator's report,
the proceeding, in the Superior Court to i
obtain judgment against Burns have
been dismissed.

A LOST RING RESTORED.
Attorney Hart Secures a Sparkler He
. Claims Was Taken From Him
by Force.
The mystery surrounding the loss of ex-
Attorney General A. L. Hart's diamond
ring has not been cleared up, but the ;
missing jewel has been recovered. It was
returned to General Hart yesterday by
Chief of Police Fletcher of Oakland. The
promised reward of $100 will be paid At
torney Hugh Aldrich.
The manner in which General Hart was
separated' from the ring, which was a
present from his wife, may never be
known. According to his story he was
drugged with knock-out drops while jour- I
neying from Sacramento to this city, j
While under the influence of some drug, i
he claims, the ring was removed from his
finger forcibly. He did not miss it until
he reached the end of his journey
He advertised at once, -offering' a re- j
ward of .100 for the return of his property !
Upon the appearance of the advertisement !
Attorney Aldrich answered it. He claimed
that his client", a reputable resident of '
Oakland, found the ring as he- was leav
ing the train at Sixteenth street and com
missioned him to return it upon payment '
of the proffered reward. The attorneys
could not agree for some time as to the
method to be pursued in returning the
ring. They finally settled their differences
and the property was returned to its
rightful owner.

PLAYED WITH MATCHES
AND BURNED TO DEATH
FATE OF FIVE-YEAR-OLD GRACE
THEUNER.
Help Came Quickly, but Too Late to
Save the Childâ She Died
in a Few Hours.
Grace, the five-year-old daughter of
Henry Theuner of ISO Parker avenue was
badly burned yesterday noon while play
ing with matches. She died at 7 o'clock
last night.
According to the statement of the
mother, the little one had a strange fancy
for matches and whenever the parental
eye was turned away she would steal a
bunch and in some secluded corner she
would amuse herself by striking them
and watching them burn.
Just before the noon hour yesterday,
while Mrs. Theuner was preparing lunch
eon, little Grace secured a bunch of
matches and toddled over to a vacant lot
opposite the house, where she proceeded
with her favorite amusement. Soon
after the mother was startled by the
agonizing shrieks of her child. Rushing
to the front door she found little Grace
making her way toward the house with
her clothing all ablaze. The mother
rushed into the house for blankets, but
her 11-year-old son Willie was quicker.
He secured a bucket of water and with
it extinguished the flames.
The child was carried into the house
and Drs. Neimler and Cleary were caller*
in. They found the child was past hu
man aid*. The- whole lower portion of
her body was charred, the flesh almost
dropping from the wounds. The doctors
applied temporary remedies and recom
mended that the little one be removed to
the Children's Hospital. This was done.
The physicians there bandaged the body
more thoroughly, but all the time they
could see that the little life was fast eb
bing away. After a few hours' suffering
little Grace breathed her last.
After the accident there was a rumor
to the effect that the child's clothing was
set on fire in play by another little girl.
Diligent inquiry showed that there was
no truth in the statement.
Circus in Town.
An Indoor circus and a Swiss Alpine
i wrestling tournament will be the draw
ing card at Glen Park to-morrow (Sun
i day). Under the auspices of the Swiss
Athletic Club a number of the club
members will contest for prizes, com
'â  mencing at 12 m. on the recreation
grounds in front of the heater.
The "circus in the barn" will be made
lup of the following attractions: Bare
back trick riding, hurdle racing, Olym
pian riding, steeplechasing, trained ani
mals, Japanese acrobats, umbrella toss-
ing, trapeze performance, tight-rope
wonders, feats of strength, equilibrists,
tumblers and funny clowns.
A Supposed Tool Thief.
John Donovan was locked in the tanks
yesterday by Detectives Ryan and
ODea, who placed against" him. a charge
of burglary. He is accused of stealing
several hundred dollars' worth .of iron
and steel workers* tools.
Donovan is supposed to be the man
who broke into the Murphy-Grant build
ing on McAllister and Jones streets a
few days ago and stole all the. tools ne

had been putting up a fire escape, and he
left them with hardly a tool to work

a similar visit a few days before. Most
of these tools have been recovered.

'OREGON CROP PROSPECTS.
OREGON CROP PROSPECTS.
B. S. Pague, Government Section Director for j
Oregon, Department of Agriculture, gives an I
unfavorable outlook for the fruit and grain j
crops in Oregon this year. The Prune crop j
will be very short, and ln some districts a fail- j
ure. The trees blossomed heavily, but when
the fruit began 'to set it dropped off. This is j
precisely what occurred in California. The j
same condition applies to ' Peaches. Apricots I
and Cherries. Pears and Apples promise a good |
crop. In conclusion, the report says:
"The reports from all sections of the State
do not indicate that favorable condition of
products and live stock which is usual. It must .
be acknowledged that current weather condi- ]
tions are not favorable to good crops, and .
present prospects are not encouraging. A
change to more seasonable weather will cor- j
rect much of that which Is now so adverse;
this Is true of grain and root crops. The fruit
crop, from present reports, will not be as large
as It was last year, and it may yet prove to
Ie poorest on record."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 19.â The stock market was
abandoned almost wholly to professional trad
ers on the floor of the exchange. No outside
demand was apparent at any point ln the list.
Prices were marked up sharply at the open
ing on a demand from the shorts who sold
the specialties yesterday. Sugar, Brooklyn and i
the Flower group generally showed the larg
est gains, the demand being obviously from
the short interests. Anaconda mining showed
strength both In London and here, which was
well maintained* throughout the day, and the ;
tone of Manhattan was also firm without any j
published news to account for it. The open
ing demand from the shorts was soon satisfied
and prices slipped away, but without any pres
sure to sell. The dullness at the decline seemed
to Impress the professionals that the reaction
was over and they turned buyers again, mark- ,
ing prices up, especially in Sugar and Brook
lyn Transit. But it became quickly evident
that 'the bull interests which were active early ,
in the week were not prepared to resume oper
ations and the advance did not hold. The ab- :
sence of any demand for stocks caused the '
traders to turn bean again, and the market
sagged and drifted quite aimlessly for the bal
ance of the day. The short sales by the trad- i
ers were covered before the close, bringing
prices in a great many cases back to about
last night's level. London bought a few stocks i
In this market, but took no active part ow
ing to the pending holidays there.
The railroad bond market continued to show !
a large Investment demand, especially for re- 'â¢
cent reorganization issues. Total sales $4,437,- I
00('. United States new 4s advanced % ln the I
bid price.
The total sales of stocks to-day amounted to I
443.480 shares, including: American Steel and

STOCK OPERATIONS ON WALL STREET.
NEW YORK. May 19. â Bradstreefs Re-
view of the New York stock market to-
morrow will say: Ex-Governor Flower
had been the most conspicuous bull leader f&r
the past two weeks, and the success which had
attended his operations in People's Gas, Rock
Island, New York Air Brake, Federal Steel,
Brooklyn Rapid Transit and ether leading
stocks had given an influence with the
speculative public unparalleled in the history
of the stock market. The unexpected news of
his death which awaited Wall street last i
Saturday morning seemed to many the signal i
for a decided break In the market. On the I
other hand. it was quickly recognized that the j
large financial Interests engaged ln the mar- |
ket would be sure to prevent any serious mis-
hap. This proved to be the case, and though j
at the opening on Saturday morning a- flood of j
short selling and liquidation was met which
carried People's Gas down from 119, the pre- '
ceding night's close, to Ml, Brooklyn Rapid j
Transit from 117% to 100 and Federal Steel from
61% to 50, with corresponding declines In not
only the Flower stocks, but ln other parts of
the list, there was almost instantly a sharp
rally. Brokers who are credited with acting
for the Standard Oil Interest, for Keene and
other large operators, had buying orders and
prices were advanced so that a large part of the
early declines were regained. The danger of
an outpouring of the long stocks held by com-
mission houses for their customers was thus
averted, and the liquidation, if one was neces
sary, became a question of time. Further as-
sistance was given to the market by the ap
pearance of an excellent bank statement on
, Saturday and by the assurance that the lead-
ing banks would, so far as it was proper for
them to do so, extend all needful accommoda
tion to stock market borrowers.- It also ap
peared that the late Mr. Flower had no large
speculative holdings, that the firm in which he
was a principal partner would continue with-
out change and that his associates were fully
convinced of the value â his properties. Be-
vond this it was recognized that the larger in-
terests .of the street having various Important
deals on hand, like the Amalgamated Copper
Company subscription or the financing of the
i Carnegie Steel Company, would not and could
not allow the market to become demoralized.
' Support from such quarters was plainly ap-
parent throughout the week. The Indisposition
of the general public to buy stocks and the ten-
dency to reduce long holdings was also no less
: marked. London, though at first obliged to
acquire stocks at the concessions, afterward
turned a seller and was credited with dispos-
â¢ ing of considerable holdings of Baltimore and
I Ohio securities and of Southern Pacific when
they exhibited a rising disposition. The mark-
ed strength of the bond market- and advance of
Government bond values, together with the rel
; ative steadiness of the dividend paying stock
list, was taken into account by the market, but
i on the other hand the granger shares seemed
heavy, a fact attributed to the continuance of
' unfavorable crop rumors. The support, which
has already been described, was in the earlier
part of the week largely concentrated in the
i Flower Blocks and the Industrials. Sugar. was
'â  made active and strong again and further re-
I coveries scored in People's Gas, Federal Steel,
Brooklyn Rapid Transit and their companions.
' The decision of Governor Roosevelt to call an
; extra session of the New York Legislature for
â¢ the purpose of amending the Ford franchise tax
I bill was another factor having a favorable ef
fect upon speculative sentiment. Nevertheless,
by Thursday a renewed reaction took place ln
the Flower stocks and industrials, while the
â  support seemed to shift to the grangers and
i the dividend . payers. On Friday the market
was generally dull and Irregular and showed
a disposition to sell off.
I BRADSTREET'S ON CONDITION OF TRADE
NEW YORK, May 19.â Bradstreefs of to-
morrow will says:
The feature of the trade situation this week
is the renewed strength of wheat and other
cereals, iron and steel and last, but not least.
raw wool, which has heretofore lagged behind
other staples in a discouraging way. The
, price-making features in cereals are not en-
tirely of encouraging character, being chiefly
; the less favorable reports as to the growing
crop West and Northwest and advances of in
' sect damage influencing Western markets
i toward a higher plane in the face of a dls-
couragingly small export business, caused in
' some degree by the continuance of the strike
'of grain-handlers at Buffalo, checking the
i movements of large quantities of grain to the
seaboard. The added strength in iron is based
Jargely upon heavy buying of plgiron in the
Central West, sympathetically influencing
prices at all markets. Reports are of old and
' new furnaces going Into blast, but these ad
' vices and the new plants projected to be built
' apparently do not reassure consumers, who are
beginning to place orders for the first part
of next year at present prices. Excitement ln
iron is not ' confined entirely to this country.
i however, as shown by a speculative advance at
leading British markets, but a sample of the
Irregularity caused by the immense current
I world's demand Is furnished in the case of for-
eigners seeking supplies in this country at the
same time that orders for rails have been
placed by American companies with the Eng-
; lish makers. Foreign wool markets continue
above American, heavy sales of Australian
i wools for re-export are made and heavy sup
j porters of .this class of wool are nearly ex-
hausted at' Boston. Aside from the exceptions
noted the tendency is toward steadiness ln
prices and most provisions, coffee and sugar
l among groceries, lead and copper among met-
I als and cotton and its various manufactures
' among textiles, are all reported unchanged on
i the week. Speculation in cotton lags, notwith-
standing good trade advices from home and
abroad, and rather less favorable crop reports.
Lumber, as for a long time past, continued in
excellent demand. Building activity is wide
read, prices hold all their old advances and
the tendency Is apparently still upward. Re-
fined sugar Is in rather better demand, but
raws are rather quiet at last: week's decline.
: Hides and leather are strong at old quota-
tions, a new feature reported this week being
a good demand for some grades of upper leath
er for export account. Less favorable weather
has tended to check distributive demand at re-
tail, but ln the wholesale lines trade is regard-
ed as very fair and even satisfactory for the
advanced stage of the season.
I Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 2.212,206 bushels, against 3/284.
- bushels last week, 4.064,832 bushels In the
corresponding week of 18-8; 2,655,8â bushels In
1897; 1,-06.005 bushels in 1894 and. 2,754,023 bush-
els in 1893. Since July 1 this season the ex-
! ports of wheat aggregate 205,271,C54 bushels,
I against 286,4*7,456 bushels last year. Business
I failures for the week number 166 against 169
last week, 211 in this week a ' year ago, 245
ln 1897, 216 in 1896 and 206 In 1895. â¢
Business failures In Canada number 18,
against 21 last week, 36 in this week a year ago,
21 in 1897. 28 In 1896, and 25 In 1895.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, May ID.â R. G. Dun ft Co.'s
Weekly Review of Trade to-morrow will say:
While buying 200,000 tons of Bessemer pig at
Pittsburg gave reason for the advance in price
to $16 50, with gray forge quoted at *15 per
ton, it is not quite clear as it might be that
the output, which is 255,000 tons monthly, ac-
Iâ¢ cording to the Pittsburg Record, and has since
been largely Increased by the addition of many
furnaces, will continue to fall^below < the de-
mand. For the requirements Tn various de-
partments for manufactured products It must
I be recognized as scarcely measurable, and does
| not seem as much diminished as might be ex-
pected by higher prices and long delay In de-
liver)*- f In plates, for instance, the demand
I covers many, thousand tons for bridges at Chi
THE SAN /. FRANCISCO CALL, SATTJIU) AT, MAY 20. 15 99. â 
cago and Pittsburg and a Philadelphia concern
accepted several thousand tons and ' afterward
was obliged to refuse more after a concern In
the same city refusing over 1200 tons. The j
shipments of boots and shoes from the East
have been for, two weeks of May 22 per cent I
larger than last year and 50.9 per cent larger j
than ln 1892. Better prices, which have been .
asked for several months, are now more gen- ;
erally paid for men's w ar, though most works
are covered by earlier orders for four months i
ahead or more. Leather shows hesitation, deal-
ers apparently questioning whether the rise
has not been too much. At Chicago the same
question runs through the hide market, though
advances are slight.
Speculators are doing a large business ln i
wool, acme foreign and some American. They j
have bought 7,000,000 pounds of Australian wool j
ln bond here, as Is now reported, andl, about j
1,000,000 rounds of domestic Territory wool is j
also said to have been sold for export at about '
42c clean. But this does not cast much light ,
on the - question whether speculative eales I
abroad have yet been covered or will be within >
a short time, nor Is there any indication that I
the market here will respond to the temporary I
foreign demand. The orders for woolen goods j
are decidedly better and although the Woolen j
Association is not yet in operation It seems to j
have given some confidence to speculators In !
woolen goods. ';â -".. v'
Wheat has advanced during the past week '
about 4c and nobody can tell why. although j
the exports in the past two weeks have been .
1,569,006 bushels, flour included, against 8,135,
- last year. Better shipments were expected i
after the opening of navigation and there, is j
really no use in considering the dreams of j
Western speculators and crop reports at this
time. No one can form a fair judgment at .the
middle of May regarding the output which will
be visible to everybody ln the middle of July. |
The best that can be done Is to accept the crop
reports, official and other, almost within defi
nite allowances. Better shipments are ex-
pected after the opening of navigation and
are in fact coming, the outward movement
from Duluth alone in two weeks reaching
nearly 4,000,000 bushels. Lack of rain in Cali
fornia has caused a large reduction ln all es
timates for that State and Pacific exports are
decreasing, and ' holders are less ready to ac-
cept current prices with the prospect of. a
shortage. i ,
Failures for the week have been 147 in the
United States, against. 250 last year, and 17
in Canada, against 29 last year.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May I?.â Claims of serious dam-
age by Hessian flies, light receipts and re-
ported drought ln Russia started wheat trad-
ers on the rampage at the opening. The pit
was flooded with buying orders by the bulls
and shorts were forced to cover. As a result
%c -was added to last, night's closing price
during the first half hour's trading. Profit tak-
ing on the bulge, however, checked the up-turn
and sent prices off a cent, but outside demand
took care of the liquidation and the rally frorm.
the break was as prompt as the decline had
been. : ' , . , ,
After that the market ruled quiet within

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ A good deal of lurid bull news Is |
being received here and at Chicago, but it has !
little effect on the market. Yesterday's Install- '
i ment reported a strong Chicago market, with j
! foreigners buying. The news from Russia was \
! unfavorable, and the crop outlook in the Dan- ]
I Ã¼blan and Black Sea districts was quoted as
sensationally bad. Snow, the statistician, an- !
j nounced that winter wheat had gone back fast :
' in the past ten days, and that the country i
would not raise 275.000.000 bushels. Toward the
close the Chicago market shaded off on heavy
sales of long wheat. '

* ing the past several "winters I had been troubled with sickness, but this winter I have
been free of it. - I have advised several parties up here to try your Belt, and they have
done so with success. , Hoping you will have as good success in every case as you have '
had in mine, I remain, yours very truly, : ALFRED S. HAMLIN.

Case of J. H. Wilson

Presiding Judge Graham Will Con-
Presiding Judge Graham Will Con-
sult Chief Lees as to the Advis-
ability of Trying More
Cases.
Fo- the second time a lurv In .Tndfre
Graham's court has brought In a verdict
of acquittal in the recent notorious poker
___>.-. .Ââ  iu_i v\;i.- mat of diaries W.
Redman, proprietor of the Palace saloon,
867 Market street, charged with permit
ting a -percentage game cf poker to be
played, and yesterday in the case of J.
H. Wilson, charged with conducting a
game in the same saloon, the jury within
ten minutes returned a verdict of acquit
tal. There is also the case of H. A. Hor-
Lein of the Cafe Royal, tried before a jury
in Judge Mogan's court, in which the
jury stood eleven for acquittal and one
for conviction. In view of these facts
Judge Graham says he will consult Chief
Lees to-day as to the advisability of go
ing to the trouble and expense of trying
any more cases of the kind.
When Wilson's case .was resumed yes
terday afternoon the cross-examination of
Policeman Tyrrell was concluded and Po
licemen G. XV. Meyer and John C. Mur
phy gave their testimony," which corrob
orated Eastman and Tyrrell's evidence.
This closed the case for the prosecution.
The defendant, Wilson, testified that no
more than two checks were taken from
each "pot" for a game and they were
utilized In providing the players with
liquor, cigars or sandwiches and for cards
and attendance. Redman, the proprietor,
and Samuel Aaron, the manager, testified
to the same effect. The average amount
taken from a table per hour was 51 36 and
as a rule the table was indebted to the
lloUSe. "3-^K*Â£l-5-9?-H_HB-!-9Â£VSâ^
After the testimony was all in the ques
tion of making an- argument to the jury
was discussed, and a juror put an end to
it by remarking: "We have heard enough
about it already." Both sides thereupon
waived an argument.
After being charged by the court the
jury retired and in ten minutes returned
a verdict of acquittal.

+
ALAMEDA. May 19.â Frank Blanchard, j
a High street merchant, nearly met an
awful death last evening in the soft, !
slimy, black mud near the Bay Farm Is- â 
land bridge. He had sunk to his chin in'
the ooze and in .a moment more would
have disappeared beneath the mud. when ;
a couple of men. attracted by his cries for
help, appeared on the scene and rescued |
him.
- -hard, who Is a very heavy man,
was attempting to board a dredger In j
course of construction. it was some feet ;
from the shore of a muddy slough and |
the only means of getting aboard was by
crossing a plank. When Blanchard was
midway between the shore and the
dredger the plank broke under his weight,
dropping him feet first into the mud.
He attempted to make his way to shore
or at least where he could grasp one end
of the broken plank, but instead of mak
ing headway he only sank deeper and
deeper into the slime as he continued hie j
struggles. Finally the mud reached his
hips. No help was In sight and his re
peated calls for succor remained unan- I
swered. Darkness was rapidly coming |
and he felt himself being slowly drawn,
down by the suction of the mud.
The ooze finnllv reached his armpits.
Hestruggled to prolong his life by stretch
ing forth his arms to stay the downward
movement toward sure death, biij. his
arms found no support and they also were
soon beneath the mud. As the slime
crawled up toward his neck and the little
crabs began to play tag around him he
gave one desperate yell for help and was
rewarded by a reply. â ','.'
The searchers had heard his first calls
but failed to locate him. They were with
in twenty feet of the slough and were
about to turn back, thinking they were
the victim of a slier, when Blanchard's
last shriek attracted them.
The broken plank was thrown to j
Blaiichard and while he clung to it and
kept himself above the surface the men
secured a rope, and finally with additional j
assistance pulled the victim out of the
slough and from the verge of a muddy
grave.
BLIND JOSEPH
SANDERS WILL
TAKE CONTROL
H Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 19.
After experiencing four years of a grad
ual decline in the manufacture of broom Â»
and the Incomes of its inmates, the Home
for Adult Blind will have a new superin
tendent June 1. This step has been de
cided upon by the new board of directors
appointed by Governor lags.
The. nation of Superintendent. Hays
has been accepted, and the blind superin
tendent, Joseph Sanders, who was de
posed four years ago by a Democratic
administration, after a long term of suc
cessful management, will be reinstated.
Superintendent Sanders is one of the
Meverest blind, men of the age, and the
manner in which he conducted the Blind
Home was such that a great number of
visitors of the Institution could not be
persuaded that he was without his sight.
The new board consists of Colonel John
P. Iris:: and Directors Spaulding, Sanborn,
Wells and Randolph, and they are unani
mous in making the change. For many
years the Blind Home has practically
failed of its purpose, and for a consider
able time the broom factory, its solo
source of revenue outside the State appro
priation, has been closed. This step was
taken by order of the directors, who dis
covered that under existing conditions
they were making brooms at a loss and
could not dispose of them when they
were made. The only means by which the
blind men could procure pocket money
and funds with which to buy clothes was
by making brooms, and last winter many
of them suffered fearfully from the cold
weather for want of proper clothing. It
has always been the contention of old
members of the board of directors that
with a practical blind superintendent with
a thorough knowledge of tie- broom corn
market the home could be maintained
ln such a manner as to produce a fair
income. Such an Income was produced
all the time Superintendent Sanders was
in office.
Secretary Havens has also been de
posed and George S. Meredith of the old
Republican City Central Committee has
been appointed secretary. The regular
meeting of the board will be held June l.
at which time the new superintendent
will take office, and it is probable that the
patronage of the Institution will see other
changes.
Last evening the retiring superintend
ent. John Hays, was presented with a
gold watch by the employee of the Insti
tution. The Informal affair took place at
lilt- home and was marked by words of
appreciation on both sides.

â¢ BRKELET. Ma. 19. Postofflce In-'
BERKELEY. May 19.â Postoffice In-*
spector J. W. Erwin returned to-night
from Cuba, where has has been engaged
under General E. (Â». Rathbone in organ
izing the United States mail service for
.he island. He left for California on the
22d of last month, staying two weeks in
Washington. D. C.
Mr. Erwin brings word that the con
dition of things In the island is very
quiet. He was favorably impressed with
the Cubans and thinks them well dis
posed toward the United States. It is his
opinion that if 'a vote were take,, of the
native population It would be largely in
.favor of annexation. Opposition, he ex
plained, was due to certain political agi
tators, but the influence of these was fast
waning. The war, he said, had left the
Interior of the country In a most dep.or
abie state, and a certain kind of fever,
termed \by the natives "Weyler fever,"
was spreading everywhere.
In certain parts or the Island the crops
for this season were a failure. With re
gard to the mail service, Mr. Erwin ex
plained that It bad been reorganized
tipon the American system and was now
In thorough working order under charge
of General Rathbone. â

Private letters that are now arriving
from the gold fields confirm t he news of
a rich rind at Cape Nome. One dated at
"Unalaklik, January 7, 189.," says there
are "bigger and richer gold fields there
than anything the Klondike can show."
There are acres and acres of rich claims,
and the men now on the ground chnnot
begin to locate them all. No labor can
be had for love or money, and it is a case
of every man for himself. Says â¢ the

How Isabella Turnbull Laing Openly
How Isabella Turnbull Laing Openly
Evinced Her AfEection for Rob-
crt Hill, Who Is Named
as Co-Respondent.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, May 19.
Flirting at their wooden wedding last
January Is made the basis of a most, sen- '
sational cross-complaint and answer filed j
late this afternoon by Peter Miller Laing, !
, whose wife, Isabella Turnbull Lalng, is |
; suing for a divorce on the ground of ex
. treme cruelty. ;
| The defendant husband alleges: "That
on January 7, 1899. while they were cele-
I brating the anniversary of their wooden
j wedding, Isabella T. Laing. in the pres
j ence of all the guests, openly and wan
! tonly flirted with Robert Hill, a single
man, and thereafter almost daily up to
March 31 left her home to visit at the
| home of Robert Hill, for whom she no-
toriously evinced**\her affection, cruelly
: neglecting defendant and failing on nu
merous occasions to cook his meals."
Robert Hill is named as co-respondent,
and throughout the cross-complaint many
I clandestine meetings between the wife
and Hill, both here and at her sister's
home in Alameda and at the home of a
Mr. Hunter, are cited as damaging cir
cumstances of her infidelity.
"On numerous occasions," continues the
plaintive and alleged wronged husband, i
"Hill was seen to hug and kiss Isabella
Laing, and on one occasion â¢ defendant
asked her not to have- anything more to
do with said Hill, but she answered: 'I ;
would not do anything to harm that
boy." " All of which caused Mr. Lalng
, much mental anguish. \
Complaining further. Laing charges ,
, his wife with intemperance, cruelty and :
conspiracy. The latter consists of an al- ;
leged scheme hatched between Mrs.
Laing and her brother John, whereby a i
sister Jamirria was brought to the Laing
! home one evening to cook Laing's sup
; per and remain there all night, while Mrs.
Lalng stayed at the home of her brother.
"Hut." explains the cross-complaint, "di-
vining the purpose of . his wife, he sent
Jamima to her room ln Oakland."
The allegations of cruelty and Improper
relations with this sister made in Mrs.
j Laing's complaint are all severally denied '
I by the defendant, though he admits that !
I oh four occasions he took Jamima buggy-
I riding at the request of plaintiff: and the
charge by the wife that defendant com-
pelled or ordered her to go to Madame
: Jaequez to have a criminal operation per-
formed is also denied and answered by
i cross-complaining that Mrs. Lalng went
to Madame Jacques voluntarily on the:
i advice of a lady friend.
These and divers other actions, Laing .
asserts, caused him great shame and
scandal and inflicted upon him grievous
mental anguish, degrading and humiliat- I
ing him in the eyes of the world, where
; fore he asks for a decree dissolving to the
I bonds of matrimony and assigning to the
i respective parties their share of the com
munity property, which consists of a
house and lot on Blame avenue, near
Twelfth street, and 'about $600 worth of
personal property. ' j
WIGNEY'S BODY FOUND.
He Fell From the Olympic Pier Near
the Cliff House a Month Ago.
The mutilated body of George A. Wig
ney was discovered yesterday morning in
a rocky cove near the suction pipe of the
Sutro Baths by H. B. Nabb. The : head
and both hands were gone and the re
mains were, very much decomposed.
Wigney was 20 years old and a clerk by
occupation.: On April 14 of this year he
paid a visit to the Cliff House beach with
his mother 'sister. He went to the
end of the Olympic Club pier, a very dan
gerous place, and while reading a book
fell or jumped off into the water. The
body was not recovered until yesterday.
The body was taken to the Morgue and
was identified there by the mother and
two sisters of the deceased, the identifica
tion having been made possible by the
laundry marks on the underclothing. The
lamentations of the grief-stricken women
were most distressing.
The remains were turned over by. Coro
ner Hill to an Alameda undertaker, and
the funeral will be held from the family
residence, 1562 Railroad avenue, Alameda,

Last evening Alexander Loughborough,
who shot "Buck" Morse in this city some
i time ago, and "Blockers" Hanley enter
j tamed a party of friends in a side room
j of the Grotto, opposite the City Hall.
i An overindulgence in beer caused a mv
' tual disagreement, during which some of
: the party amused themselves by throwing
] bottles and glasses at an inoffensive
waiter. .v.;:*.-
Officer Butterworth was called, and, in
company with Coroner Hill, who hap
: pened to be in the resort, quelled the dis
i turbance. In the meantime a riot alarm
was sent to the Central station and a
number of officers were dispatched to the
scene. No arrests' were made.
Police Cannot Have the Tug.
The matter of giving the quarantine tug
used by the Board of Health to the Po
lice Department for use along the water
front came up for consideration before
the Health and Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors yesterday. After
some discussion it was decided that fur
ther consideration of the, matter be In
definitely postponed, which means that
the police will not get the boat.
The National Athletic Club was granted
8 permit to conduct a boxing contest on
some date between the, Ist and the H'Jih of
next month.'
Makes Her Life Miserable.
John J. Coffey, a teamster, was con
victed by Judge Mogan yesterday on the
charge of battery upon Mary Paul, a tail
oress who works at 62 Tehama street. The
girl testified that she at one time kept
company with Coffey, but gave him up.
Since then he has made her life miserable

ing out of doorways upon her and fright
ening her. May 17 be grabbed her as she
was leaving her work, and struck her.
Coffey will get a severe sentence .to-day.

THE OHIO'S FIRST RIVET.
Work on the Nation's Defender Com-
menced at- the Union Iron Works.
.The work of .building the hull of the
Ohio was commenced at the Union Iron
Works yesterday. . During the past few
weeks men have been . busy shaping the
ribs j and plates, and, having got all the
pieces in place for the start, it was or
dered yesterday that the first rivet' shout
be driven into place in trie keel -of the
great naval fighter. There was- no un
usual ceremony in the driving of this first
rivet, except that a greater number than
usual of the officers of the. yard were on
hand. , .
Besides the building of this huge man
of-war the Union Iron Works has four
other vessels on the ways. The construc
tion of these has taxed every inch of
available space in the shipyard and at
the same time has been .the means of giv
ing work to about 3000 men.

A Very Strong Resolution Defining
A Very Strong Resolution Defining
the Position of the Laboring
Man to Be Sent to Presi-
dent McKinley.
At a meeting of the San Francisco La
bor Council last evening the action of the
military authorities in dealing with the
strikers at Wardner. Idaho, and the sen
timents of Major General Merriam and
Governor Steunenberg regarding labor or
ganizations were denounced in a caustic
resolution, a copy of which will be for
warded to the President of the United
States that he may feel the pulse of San
Francisco toilers on the Wardner situa
tion.
The resolution was drafted by a com
mittee appointed at a previous meeting
and adopted last night with but a sin
gle dissenting voice. Its purport Is a con
tradiction of the expression of Idaho's
Governor that labor organizations are
criminal in purpose and prohibitive .of
employment to members thereof; also
that |the utterances of Major General
Merriam are the underminings of civil
liberty. it is as follows:
Whereas, a condition of momentous gravity
has risen from the conduct .-i the State and
Federal authorities in dealing with the parties
suspected of comDllclty In the destruction of
th- Hunker Hill and Sullivan mill at Wtird
ner Idaho, on April 29. 1599; and
Whereas, this condition is the result of ut
terances made by Major General Merriam, I*.
S. A., while in authority on the scene, to the
effect that trade unions should be legally pro
hibited as criminal conspiracies, followed by a
proclamation of Governor Steunenberg of
Idaho, which declares that "certain organiza
tions or combinations (the miners' unions) ex
isting in Shoshone County have shown them
selves to he criminal in purpose by destroying
property and permitting murder." and pro
hibiting the employment by mine-owners of
men -'belonging to said or other criminal or
ganizations" during the continuance of mar
tial law, with the alternative of closing the
mines; therefore be It
Resolved, by the San Francisco Labor Coun
cil, that we condemn the language of Major
General Merriam as a malicious attack upon
organized labor an.l a threat against all forms
of civil liberty; and further
Resolved, That we condemn the action of
Governor Steunenberg in declaring the cer
tain organizations or combinations in ques
tionâ to wit. the miners' unionsâ to be crim
inal In purpose, and prohibiting: the employ
ment of members thereof, as -an assumption
opposed to the known facts,- an arrogant
stretch of authority under martial law, and
a total subversion of the principle, underlying
the determination of both law' and equity, that
trial and conviction must precede condemna
tion and punishment; and further
Resolved. That we urgently protest against
the cruel and Inhuman treatment of the min
ers nd others now under arrest at Wardner,
end against the arrest and removal of the civil
officers of Shoshone County and appointment of
others chosen with a view to their pliancy
under the military regime, as an, aggravation
el the main indictments, designed for the pur
pose of terrorizing the community and the
public at large; and further
Resolved. That we see in the present situa
tion at Wardner. Idaho, a definite relation to
the recently inaugurated policy of the Govern
ment, which repudiates the principle of equal
and Inalienable rights, as applied to those peo
ples of other countries with whom the Govern
ment Is now at war, and, therefore, that this
situation clearly forecasts the extension of
that policy with the same results to all the
people of the United States; and further
Resolved. That we submit this statement of
our position to th* public In the hope and con
fidence that It will arouse the fullest sense of
the danger involved in these conditions. We
deplore the acts of violence against property
and the deaths that have occurred in the af
fected locality, but we deny that the.. cir
cumstances afford any justification for the
course now being pursued by the authorities.
The civil authorities are vested with full
power to punish the persons responsible for
these crimes, and- we pledge our assistance to
that end by .-very means compatible with law.
We. therefore, declare that the action of Gen
eral Merriam and Governor **teunenberg is
conclusive evidence of a policy to destroy civil
government and to establish upon the ruins
thereof an oligarchs dependent upon and sup
ported by military power. Confronted by this
condition. It behooves â¢ every citizen to voice

ANOTHER FOWLER
WILL DISCOVERED
FILED FOR PROBATE BY THE
DEVISEE'S ATTORNEY.
J? second will, purporting to have been
drawn by the late D. D. Fowler, the min
ing man,- who died at St. Luke's Hospital
on March 9 last, was filed for probate yes
terday. A few days after Fowler's death
a will was filed and admitted to probate
that bore date preceding his death but
five days. He left all bis property to his
children in this will with the exception
of $2500, which he bequeathed to Mrs. Wil
liam D. Fairer, of this city, who cared for
him during his last illness. Yesterday
another will, bearing date of October _._>,
IS9B, was tiled by Eugene Deuprey. This
will is witnessed by Thomas XV. Bethel.
603 Fell street, and Edwin C. Van Dyke,
at that time residing at St. Luke's Hos
pital, and with the exception that it dors
not mention Mrs. Farren is similar to the
first will filed. It reads:
Know all .men by these presents: That by
reason of th.- conduct of Ellie F. Fowler, in her
efforts to humiliate me and her apparent dis
regard of all wifely affection for me I do here
by revoke all wills and any will made by me
before the date hereof and particularly one
mede in her favor. ! further hereby declare
and will that my estate of whatsoever char
acter and wherever situate be distributed two
thirds therof to my Invalid child. Lizzie M.
Fowler, at St. .1...-. Mo., at Invalid Home, and
one-third thereof to Nellie I). Bennett, Bevier,
Mo. ; Frank B. Fowler. Kansas City, Kans..
and D. D. Fowler of th.- same place, share and
share alike, and I hereby appoint Thomas Kyle
and Thomas W. Bethel executors of this will.
In witness whereof 1 have Signed my name
to this, my last testament, consisting of one
and a third pages. D. I>. FOWLER.
Notwithstanding the fact that the first
will has been admitted to probate for a
purpose and a compromise effected be
tween decedent's will and the. devisees.
Mr. Deuprey went before Judge Coffey and
offered the will. Judge Coffey closely ex
amined the will and then asked the at
torney to what use he intended to put
the document, as 11. bore an â¢ earlier date
than the one already admitted. "The will
1 now present," answered Mr. Deuprey,
"although bearing an earlier date than
the one admitted, is of later execution
than the lirst and this we will prove." As
the date already admitted simply bears
decedent's X mark it Is quite probable
that a winning fight may be made on that
presented yesterday.
Evelyn Holt Was Absent.
Evelyn Holt, the woman who on Sep
tember 5 last tried to kill Conrad Pecker
with a pistol because the latter had mar
ried the Nemesis of Colonel Sutherland,
Mrs. Webber, did not appear when her
case was called for trial by Judge Lawlor
yesterday morning. A bench warrant
was in consequence issued by Judge Law
lor. fixing the defendant's bail at $2000,
hut it is doubtful that the warrant will
ever be served. It is said that Miss ii.it
has gone East to avoid trial and. is min
gled with the vast throngs of some big
Atlantic city when- it will be practically
impossible to detect her.

"You're a dirty cur; you profess to love
me and now I find you with another wo
man. Take that, you ingrate. and
that"-*â
"Thus spoke, Mrs. Dr. Frances Clark as
she applied a horsewhip, which she had
concealed under her sealskin coat, on the
head and shoulders of Charles Lenahan,
a well-known man about town and pro
fessional pianist.
The incident happened on O'Farrell
street near Stockton.
Lenahan, accompanied by another wo
man who is known as Cato de Hoop.
drove up to a saloon, intending to have
a bottle of wine, as Lenahan claims.
Scarcely hail they alighted from the
buggy when Mrs. Clark appeared "ii the
scene. After catching a glimpse <>l her
rival, whom she at once recognised, she
proceeded to upbraid Lenahan for his
conduct. The latter attempted to explain
that he had met the woman by accident.
when Mrs. Clark drew forth a whip
which sit.- had concealed in the folds of
her sealskin sacque and brought it down
on her lover's head. With a cry of pain
Lenahan started to join his companion,
who was seated In the buggy, but was
1 stopped by the infuriated woman. Ex-
citedly approaching her rival, Mrs. Clark
proceeded to belabor her with the whip.
"You're no woman," she indignantly re-
marked as she rained blow after blow on
the head and face of the astonished fe-
male. "I want you to understand that I
am engaged to marry this man" (point-
ing to Lenahan).- . .
"t The latter, after recovering from the
: suddenness of the attack, quickly seized
the whip and thus prevented Mrs. Clark
i from further injuring her rival. .
.With blood streaming down her face
Miss de Hoop jumped from the buggy
and assisted by a male friend 'who wit-
nessed the occurrence hastily left the
! scene.
Evidently maddened by her escape, Mrs.
, Clark, with the aid of her whip, proceed-
ed to be revenged on Lenahan. She at-
tacked him with tin- ferocity of a mad
I woman and amid declarations of unfaith-
fulness she repeatedly struck him over
- the head and shoulders with the whip.
A large crowd had collected by this time
anil they cheered the woman on.
i Satisfied that he was "up against It,"
as he expressed it. -Lenahan jumped into
his buggy and rapidly -drove away from
the scene. â ; . -
With a triumphant cry Mrs. Clark, re-
placed tho whip under her saccule and
disappeared down O'Farrell street.
. It is said that Mrs. Ciark is madly in-'
fatuated with Lenahan. Several days be-
fore the horsewhipping episode, it is au
thoritatively said that she wanted him
to marry her. It was aereed that they
i were to be married by a Justice of the
j Peace in Oakland, but she insisted that
the ceremony should be kept a secret.
According to Lenahan, she bought him a
magnificent diamond ring; in return he
purchased a marriage ring, which he gave
to Mrs. Clark. It was arranged that they
should meet at the Oakland ferry, pre-
paratory to crossing the bay and becom-
ing husband and wife, but at the last mm
ute Lenahan got "cold feet" and did not
materialize: Although angered' beyond
measure, Mrs. (.lark promised to forgive
him, provided he consented to marry her
in the near future.
W-ien,seen last night Lenahan admitted
that he had been horsewhipped by Mrs.
Clark, but persistently refused to giv*
any particulars.-
"It was only a love affair." he ex-
plained. "I got the worst of it and am
satisfied. See Mrs. Clark; she might tell
you what happened." /*"
Mrs. Clark, evidently determined not to
be Interviewed, has purposely kept out of
the way of reporters. Inquiry at her
home last night was met with the re-
sponse that she had left the .city, but
would return in a few days.
Miss de Hoop, who with Lenahan was
assaulted by Mrs. Clark, also refused to
talk about the occurrence.
"Pleas, don't say anything about it."
she pleaded last evening. "I was Indis
creet and got the worst of- it. I did not
know that Charley was engaged to marry
Mrs. Clark or I would not have gone for
a drive with him." *
Lenahan fears* that Mrs. Clark will su*
him for breach of promise of marriage,
but he claims be is prepared for any
emergency that might arise from his en
tanglement with her.

BASEBALL TO-DAY.
Oakland and San Francisco to Fight
for the Lead.
A. grand contest for first plitce honors is
the card that" the California Baseball
League .offers to the cranks this week.
The Oakland dudes have fought their way
up near the top just In time to meet their
rivals on this side of the bay in 'a strug
gle for the leadership. : ' .
Manager Harris has been sneering at
the Oaklands of late and advising Cal
Ewing to go and hire a few -men who
could play ball, but when the dudes tool
three straight games from Watsonville
by some exceptionally line, ball playing
and settled down in second place the San
Francisco magnate began to take a seri
ous view of the situation. If he succeeds
in holding the lead after the coming en
gagement with the Oaklands he may con
sider himself very fortunate. The Oak
land team is now as good a fielding club
as there Is in the league, and it remains
to be seen whether the dudes can wield
the stick with sufficient effectiveness to
overcome the winning ways of the men
in black and gold.
The cranks on both sides of the bay
are looking forward to the coming con
tests with more than usual Interest, and
there will probably be more flamboyant
rooting at Recreation Park this week
than â¢ has developed since the opening of
the season.
The line-up for to-morrow's game is as

BALDWIN ANNEX CAFE.
A New Restaurant and Billiard Hall
Opens Its Doors to the Public
;C: i To-Day.
For many weeks the Baldwin Annex,
.24-926-928 Market street and 25 Ellis street,
has been undergoing repairs in prepara
tion for the establishment of a cafe and
billiard hall that is second to. none in size
and elegance west of the Rocky Moun
tains. Its proprietorsâ Mr. G. Schmitt,
formerly proprietor of the "Fountain,"
for many years at the corner of Kearny
and Sutter streets, and Mr. J. XV. Orn
dorff. who was the first proprietor of the
Baldwin Hotel bar and billiard room
are favorably, known, not alone in this
city but throughout the coast, and are
thoroughly experienced caterers.
Under the personal direction of . Mr.
Schmitt, whose ideas have been closely
followed, the well-known firm of Haven
& Hopkins, architects, have produced an
effect in design and decoration that could
with difficulty be surpassed.
The main entrance on Market street,
twenty-one feet wide, is both imposing
and rich being finished in mahogany and
art glass. In, the Market-street front is
the billiard and bar room, to the purposes
of which tne large area is equally divided;
with Walnut-framed French plate mirrors
upon the one side and the handsome glass
finished bar extending the length of the

A DISUNIONIZED UNION.
The Mission Milkers Carrying the
White War Into the Police
court.
There is war, a white war, among the
Swiss milkers out on the Mission road.
That little social dance that was given
at the Six-mile House on last Saturday
night and which ended so disastrously
to the few who tried to adjust matters
between the union milkers and the can
cleaners has not subsided. The fight that
was precipitated in the dance hall and
which terminated with the demolition of
the front of the saloon in which tin; social
festivities were held was only the com
mencement of the lacteal war.
Since that unfortunate night fights,
which are termed "scraps" by Sergeant
Griffiths of the Seventeenth street police
station, have been the order of the day
and the night for that matter. In order
to save the Coroner a trip over College
Hill Captain Gillln has stationed three of
his athletic men on duty at the Six-mile
House. However, even the. presence of
these short-rib punchers have not been
sufficient to' quell the extractors of lacteal
fluid and can cleaners. The war has now
settled down between Joseph Regli and
Martin Schorne. The former had the lat
ter arrested a few days ago for battering
him on the, head with an empty milk
can. I The cuts were drawn together by
the surgeon's needle at the City and
County Hospital. Schorne, not to be out
done In the dispensation of justice as ad
ministered in the Police Courts, swore out
a warrant for the. arrest of Regli on the
charge of having made a vow that he
would give the. undertaker a job as soon
as the opportunity presented itself.
With this warrant Officer J. Dennan in
vaded the sacred precincts of Fassler's
dairy and in the name of the people of
the great State of California yanked
Hie 11 to prison. Judge Graham, however,
fixed his bond at $500. Whether his Honor
only valued Schorne's life at "these fig
ures or not the bond is silent.
A â  rehearsal of the "Disunionized
Union" will be had when the case is up
for hearing in the court. In the mean
time the milkers and the can cleaners
don't speak as they pass by.
Grand opening to-night of the Miramar

INVESTOGATION
OF FRAGLEY IS
INAUGURATED
Supervisors Examine
Witnesses.
The investigation into the alleged mis
conduct of Superintendent of Streets Mar
tin Fragley was inaugurated by the mem
bers of the Finance and Street Commit
tees of the Board of Supervisors yester
day afternoon. Nearly two hours were
devoted to the examination, and although
few questions were propounded to each
man called in, it is thought that the la
bors of the committees have only begun,
as there still remain 200 more witnesses
to examine.
Mr. Fragley, accompanied by his chief
deputy, A. J. Donovan, and his attorney,
John B. Gartland, entered the committee
room shortly after the session had begun.
Supervisor Perrault, chairman of the
committee, propounded but a half dozen
questions to each witness. They we're:
"Where do you work* "What is your
salary?" "How many days did you labor
last month?" "Where did you cash your
warrant?" and as they invariably an
swered "with a broker," they were asked
what commission they paid him. -i;
W. T. Sullivan, father of Mayor Phe
lan's secretary, testified that he was
earning $62 50 and had put that amount in
his pocket, excepting the amount he paid
a broker. Chairman Perrault decided -not
to ask the witness any more questions
out of respect to the co.onel. and the old
gentleman was allowed to deport.
As the trend of examination became ap
parent to Mr. Fragley and his attorney
they sat. back and took things easy. A
smile covered the Superintendent's coun
tenance and he was seemingly at peace
with the world. Martin Fragley Jr. was
called in to testify, but the cnairman al
lowed him to depart without interrogat
ing him. , . , ...
When J Kelly was examined he testi
fied thai he received $63 50, and as the
warrant called for $70 it looked as if some
wrongdoing was discovered. The witness
removed all suspicion by stating that it
must be another -Kelly, as - there were
two of the same name in the department.
Supervisor Attridge renewed his motion
to adjourn, but he was prevailed upon
to. withdraw it. A dozen more men were
examined, but all the inquisitors learned
was the name of the broker who charged
the least percentage. An adjournment
was taken until further notice from
Chairman Perrault. 'YY
It was learned after the meeting that
since the McGlade trial the Supervisors
have been desirous to discover whether
there are any "dummies" drawing pay
from the Street Department. The only
way to ascertain whether there are is to
subpena every man whose warrant is in
the hands of the board.
The Dog Fighters' Pull.
The cases against fifteen men accused
of preparing to engage in a dog fight in
of preparing to engage in a dog fight in
a pit in a saloon at the corner of Six
teenth and Church streets were called in
acting Police Judge Groezinger's court
yesterday and were stricken from the cal
endar, the Judge fining each $10, with no
alternative. . ,
Queer Cure for Vagrancy.
Ignacio Coronel was arrested Thursday
on the charge of vagrancy. He lives at
536 Vallejo street' and spent his time in
hanging around saloons on the Bnrbary
Coast. When the case was called In
Judge Graham's court yesterday his
mother and Librada Morales, a young
girl, appeared and pleaded for him. The
girl said they were engaged to be mar
ried, and as Coronel expressed his willing
ness to get married and lead a better life
the marriage license* was procured and
Justice of the Peace Kerrigan tied the
knot. Judge Graham then dismissed the
charge of vagrancy.
