___________________________
flerrin, De Yonng, Preston, Gunst and the Mexican
Colonel Himself Are to Be Placed on the Stand
to Tell What They Know.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 21.â The 'As
sembly investigating committee has at
last given evidence of a desire to inves
tigate. Whether or not the investiga
tion it proposes to make will be so con
ducted as to make it effective remains
to be determined.
, ' From a source auspiciously near the '
headquarters of Colonel Burns orders
. were issued this morning that the pro
ceedings of yesterday were not to be
repeated to-day. it being evident that
to do so would precipitate a. riot on the
'â¢floor of the Assembly. Such a demon
stration was to be avoided at all haz
ards for the reason that if it occurred
the investigating committee would be
shorn of power and that the work that
..had been delegated would be placed in
the hands of others who might not be
so anxious to promote the candidacy
of the Man from Mexico.
â¢ So it was that bright and early this
morning there was posted on the As
sembly bulletin board a notice that the
committee would meet immediately
after the noon adjournment. The no
tice was signed by Chairman Cosper,
whose dilatory tactics while he is him-
self resting under the imputation of
having solicited a $6000 brils^ for his
â¢ vote for Senator has drawn upon his
head so much criticism.
Not even the practiced eye could de
tect in the proceedings of the commit
tee when it met early in the afternoon
anything but an earnest desire on the
part of its members to do their full
duty. To this end the subpenas for
Important witnesses, which have been
held up for two days, were ordered
served, new subpenas were issued and
a generally healthy tone given to such
other business as was transacted.
As an immediate effect of this turn
in the tide of the investigation William
P. Herrin, chi*f of the Southern Pa-
cific Company's political bureau, is to
be hauled before the committee and
made to tell what he can remember of
the illicit methods by which his em
ployers have sought to influence legis
lators in the interest of the Senatorial
candidacy of D. M. Burns. The imme-
diate. purpose for which his presence is
desired is to testify concerning the al
â¢legation that Speaker of the Assembly
Howard E. Wright applied to him for
$1200 and received but $800, it being un
derstood that the money was needed
by Wright to use in his campaign.
Quite incidentally Mr. Herrin will be
asked to relate under what kind of an
agreement or for what consideration
he issued two passes from San Fran-
Cisco to New i York to Assemblyman
A. H. Merrill at the solicitation of D.
M. Burns.
Other railroad transportation held by
members of the i resent Legislature
and which was issued from the office
of Mr. Herrin will be made the subject
matt' for searching inquiry. It will
also be proper to aSk Mr. Herrin what
agreement existed between himself.
Colonel Burns and the railroad at tre
â¢time he announced that Burns was the
railroad's candidate for United States
Senator. All of this information and
much more will be required at the
- hands of Mr. Herrin if the committee
carries out its apparent determination
â¢ to do what it was created to do. :' .
Herrin is not to be the only witness
of importance. Subpenas were issued
and ordered served on M. H. de Young,
proprietor of the San Francisco Chron
icle; Moses Gunst, Dan Burns' gamb-
ling partner, and Hon. E. F. Preston.
Mr. de Young is expected to give evi
dence corroborative of evidence al
ready given in support of the charges
against Speaker Wright. It Is expected
.that Mr. Preston and Gunst will give,
evidence before the committee of a na
ture calculated to establish the" allega
tion that D. M. Burns expended the
Bum of $19,000 to secure the election of
members of* the present Legislature
and that the money was expended in
The San Francisco Call.
a manner not warranted by law or
decency.
The statement that Burns spent $19,
--000 to secure the election of certain
legislators was made by Gunst to Mr.
Preston. The latter gentleman has ex
pressed a willingness to come to Sacra
, mento if his presence is desired and
testify to the facts of the interview
between himself and Gunst. It is ex
pected Mr. Gunst will be ready and
willing to repeat under oath what he
has stated to Mr. Preston, and per"-ap3
add some particulars that .were not/
brought out during the original con
versation.
Another witness, who is to be brought
to the front as soon as a' subpena can
be served on him, Is Charles G. Lam
berson, the Visalla attorney who, lt is
charged, acted as the agent of Chair
man Cosper in the solicitation of a
bribe of $6000 from Milton J. Green,
Grant's political manager. The sub
pena for Lamberson has been held up
for two days, but when attention was
called to it to-day when the committee
met the sergeant-at-arms was in
structed to the subpena at once
and to bring Mr. Lamberson to Saca
mento at the earliest possible moment.
That the day might not be quite bare
of sensations, evidence was produced
to show that Assemblyman R. C. Dale
of Kern County had been offered a
bribe of $3000 to vote â¢ for R. N. Bulla
as his second choice candidate for
United States Senator. Such evidence
as was given in substantiation of the
charge was of a nature to indicate that
the accusation, if it be : true,' concerns a
transaction wholly without the knowl
edge of Senator Bulla and was Insti
gated by some person or persons who
are antagonistic to Bulla's . Senatorial
candidacy. C. E. Washburn, a Los An
geles newspaper [ man, was the vehicle
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JANUARY 22, 1899â THIRTY-TWO PAGES.
through which this information was I
conveyed to the committee. Without j
giving names he made it plain that As- â 
semblyman Dale had told him, so he I
declared, that he (Dale) had been of- !
fered $3000 by James Copeland of Los !
Angeles to vote for Bulla as his second ;
choice Senatorial candidate. Dale will
be put on the witness stand Monday
and asked as to the facts in the case.
Copeland will also be put under oath
and required to testify as to the truth j
or falsity of the charge.
The facts concerning the letter that
was written to Assemblyman G. G.
Clough by Dan C. Cole were related to
the committee by Judge Clough him
self. The letter contained, he said, a
statement by the writer to the effect
that if Clough favored the Senatorial
candidacy of U. S. Grant Cole would
give Clough any amount of money he
required to make his canvass. In re
ply to this letter Judge Clough wrote
that he did not propose to pledge his
vote for canvass money. - In reply to a
direct question Judge Clough said that
If he had accepted the offer made by
Cole he would have felt that he had
sold his vote. Cole has been subpenaed
as a witness, but when he was' sent for
it was found that he had left town, be
ing called home, it was said, -by illness
in his family. He left. word that he
would return on Monday,' at which time
he will be asked how- he expended the
money given him by Grant, and also,
if, when he wrote to Judge Clough, he
intended his offer of campaign funds as
a bribe.
Viewed from the standpoint of to
day's proceedings the next session of
the committee should i prove to be an
extremely interesting one.
BURNS' EFFORT? AT
REPRESENTATION FAIL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, ' Jan. 21.â efforts of the
Burns people to get representation on the
committee on Investigation this morning
almost prevailed.
Upon a resolution introduced In the
| Assembly by 'Dibble , of San Francisco
, Grove L. Johnson was made a regular
! 'member of this unique board for 'the sup
pression of evidence, and even the clever
est politician on the floor must admit the
! job a smooth one. .' It was participated
ln by Dibble and Speaker Wright. Later
Johnson positively declined to serve, and
<it was so ordered. For three days John
, son, with all the power in his plaintive
i voice, has been fighting the attempts of
' his friends vto get him on the committee.
; He has been on his feet to protest when
j there was reason to kick and when there
was not, notwithstanding that it is the
known policy of the Burns gang to have,
representation.
To-day It was considered that Mr. John
son's grandstand play had ; had the effect
desired of it, and to relieve him of the
embarrassment that would come of go
ing back on his expressed desires Speaker
Wright called him to the chair.
No sooner was he in. the chair and ap
parently deprived of the privilege of fight
ing any action" directed against him from
the floor than Dibble came to the front
with a resolution appointing him to the
committee. He feebly expostulated, but
Dibble denied his right to do so. Wright
made a play to '. relieve . him by rushing
back to the chair, but ' too lateâ the reso
lution was adopted ; before he , got the
gavel. ' :>'
, Mr. Works of San Diego, who votes for
Mr. Grant of , the same ; place, was also
appointed, but he positively declined to
act.
Said he: "Mr. Speaker, I . cannot ; and
will not serve on that committee. I came
from , the | same | town as , the candidate for
whom I am votl*j\* and you w_;o have not
been there cannot know how wrapped up
the people there are In Mr. Grant's can
didacy. If, as a member of this commit
tee, I should be called upon to censure
Mr. Grant, I should of course do so,* but
if I did I should never be able to go back
home; and, Mr. Speaker, I like San Di
ego."
"If there is no objection," said Mr.
Johnson, who was still in the chair, "the
young gentleman's resignation will be ac
cepted, so that he may return to his own
home."
There was no objection and Mr. John- :
son stood alone as the "new member.'.' ' . '
Mr. Johnson got down on the floor i
shortly after and also refused to act, at j
some length, and after some debate his
resignation was accepted.
Chairman Cosper of the investigation
committee introduced a resolution stating '
that as yet no room had been found fin
which the committee could meet, and |
"therefore" the committee should meet ;
Immediately upon adjournment in the As- i
sembly chamber. â .â¢'':'' * /

passed to engrossment and the Governor's !
signature. Under the latest amendment
lt will be possible to eradicate Speaker j
Howard E. Wright from the list of legis-/
latcrs If the committee should so find. â '. ,'
j A brazen attempt was made at / this
morning's session to unload upon the
State eighty-five copies of Hennlng's cdi
i tion of the county government act. The
resolution was introduced by Merritt'of
San Francisco, â¢'yy.fi. Y'yff ' ; â "â 'â â 'â .".?
Valentine of Los Angeles opposed the
deal, on the ground that within a short
time the present county government act
would be amended out of existence and
copies of it would be of no use to any one.
Melllck moved to amend by substituting
"one copy" for eighty-five copies, and
with the amendment the resolution
passed. \
Assembly joint resolution No. 5, by As
semblyman E. S. Sullivan of San Fran
cisco, calling upon Congress to create a
leper settlement on the island of Molokai,
was ordered sent to the Governor for his '
signature.

lution 5, relative to the Nicaragua canal,
was. adopted and ordered transferred to

jj At 1 11:30 o'clock, on motion of Dibble,
recess was taken until near time for the

committee on contested elections was read

ONLY SECRET CAUCUS
CAN HELP BURNS OUT
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-
MENTO, Jan. 21.â single ballot in
joint convention to-day gave no premo
nition of change in the situation. If it
had any significance whatever it was that
. members were assured that no break
would come before next Monday or Tues
day. Burns men. and Grant men ; who
found it convenient to be absent from the
session arranged among themselves, to
pair their votes: .hence neither, of the
candidates received the full measure of
I his strength. - ' %" . f y
It is acknowledged on all sides and ad
! mitted in the fold of the "Colonel",' . that
I Burns cannot win without resort to the
. secret caucus. , The" air Is full of caucus
: whispers. Members are ; consulted fre
| quently, 1 but 'at a late hour,; to-night the
paper had, not; been passed" around for
; signatures. ' The plan adopted is to sound
the members and ascertain from a* general
expression of opinion if It; would; be ad
visable â¢ to spring ' the written ( agreement.
I J Men : or, long;; experience Yin j California
politics and who have .been training with
the â¢ Burns : forces 'since w Herrin openly
espoused the ; cause -of the "Colonel", are
not. as confident now. as they were one
week ago. Six I days ago they - asserted
that I Burns was master of the situationâ
that' the men; voting for Barnes, Bulla,
Bard, Scott, Knight and 'Paterson would
swing into line . for . him whenever the
proper signal was given. The Burns sig
nal of distress has been flying ever since,
but no one has gone to his rescue. The
Humboldt men In the Legislature gave
the touts a jar by going from Knight to
Bulla. Anderson gave them a surprise
by going from Estee to Barnes. The
Santa Clara Assemblymen may furnish
the next surprise by going from Burns to
General Barnes. If the Santa Clara men
make this change, as talked of to-night,
they will do so on their own motion.
General Barnes asserts that he Is not
endeavoring to persuade voters to leave
other candidates. He desires that men
coming to him shall come of their own
accord. yfy
i When Milton; Green was on the rack
telling how money, was given to Howard
.Wright and goffered to Alden Anderson
the bosses of Burns' campaign for the
Senatorshlp were In high glee. They gave
voice to ; the sentiment that all the facts
should the 'brought out so that the public
would scorn Grant and compel the mem
bers voting for the. San Diego statesman
to cast ; their strength in favor of some
other aspirant for* the high position. A
change. of sentiment is now observed. As
it" seems provable' that the investigating
committee w}ll ask Moses Gunst and oth
ers* some, pertinent questions concerning
the' amount of money disbursed by Dan
Burns in the Senatorial contest the bosses
are of the opinion. that _a' caucus should
be called and the scandal so demoralizing
to the party be brought to a close. So
long as Grant's ox was the only bovine
bored investigation - was a good thing,
but as there Is danger of the Mexican
steer getting a thrust the suggestion comes
that Investigation 'should . not continue.
; Whatever may be the outcome of the
struggle, the ' Grant forces are in the
field to, fight Dan Burns to a finish. The
absolute knowledge of this fact has led
one of the leading managers of the Burns
forces to tell the "Colonel" that he can
not win. All the facts in the case will be
submitted to Herrln before next Monday
evening. Inside Information Is to the effect
that Herrin will stay by Burns as long
as the colonel believes that he has a
chance "of winning out. Burns is not a
quitter by any means, but after the
Wright experience he might hesitate at
the sight of his men being dragged
through the mire of exposure in a hope
less contest. 1 â¢ :y < : .>}y-. j '.
In some quarters Burns is sharply cen
sured for his j hard mastership in forcing
Wright into line. It is said that he might
have saved Wright from disgrace without
diminishing his ; chances . of . ultimate a suc
cess. , It transpires now that Burns was
not wholly responsible for forcing Wright
to get â  out l in the open and declare his
sentiments. The "Colonel's" most ardent
and exacting henchmen insisted that
Wright, who was posing as a purist,
should be made to take his dose at once.
The argument .was presented that
Wright's declaration In favor of Burns
would give several others courage to defy
the people.. The result was exactly, con
trary to the expected outcome. The dis
play of public indignation following
Wright's change frightened those who
; were ! counted on to follow his example.
This explanation is given by the friends
of the "COlonel" to prove that he is not so
bad a master, as . some would make | him
out. 1 In other words, the devil 16 not as
black as he is painted.
. Green : Is Much Better. I

there is so complete an account of all

] The principal Interest of the day has
been in ' the investigation and certain
formalities in connection with it. As
semblymen appear ready and even
anxious to have the investigation pro
ceed, but uniformly object to being
Identified with the committee. An effort
was made to cause the bringing in of
a; speedy report, but it did not meet
with favor. The plan to enlarge the
committee was sanctioned freely, the
trouble being- that no Assemblymen
could be ' found who were willing to
undergo an experience of martyrdom.
There â¢ was an exchange of - many
"words, once In awhile' the, words be
ing warm as Radcllff's hair and mak
ing.: Johnson's whiskers fairly - curl.
There were, however, no active hostili
ties,, and all of the speakers acknowl
edged before adjournment that "all the
others . were gentlemen; y
In the afternoon the committee re
sumed its session with the original
seven. ' It seemed . to ', manifest , greater
animation than had been its: custom,
such is the j power of the \ press, and it
was entirely good natured. To be sure.
Cosper and Mellick took a few shots at
the papers, but there was: no malice in
them, and the . papers had ;; shot first,
anyhow. Even Attorney Bacon did not
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ruffle them, although he endeavored to
stroke them the wrong way.
Newspaperman Washburn took the
stand and told of a conversation in
which he had participated. In this con
versation an Assemblyman, Washburn
affirmed, said James Copeland had of
fered $3000 for a vote for Bulla. Then
there was a pricking up of all the ears
in the room. Washburn would nat give
the name of the Assemblyman, but
acknowledged that Captain Barbour
had been present during the conversa
tions Mellick Jumped to the belief that
the Assemblyman was Dale, and tried
to trap Washburn into admitting,
which the witness came a long way
from doing. He was not pressed hard
on the point, although told that he had
been skating close to the door of the
Jail.
i Washburn spoke of Copeland as a
Southern Pacific attorney, but didn't
know to a certainty if he was willing
to swear to whether or not this was
the case. He also acknowledged his
expression that the "pay car was
here" to have been a josh. However,
as to the chief allegations he showed
no sign of doubt, and a committee in
search of something tangible had here â¢
a clew. Messrs. Dale and Copeland will
be given a chance to tell all they know
about it.
Next Captain Barbour was called.
An elderly man, gray and slight,
he never was rattled an instant..
While he remembered that a con
versation, Washburn, Dale and him
self being present, had occurred,
fc-r the life of him he could not
recall what had been said. He cer
tainly did not recall having heard any
thing about money, at least a specified
sum or for the purpose of buying a
vote. There were such rumors going;
everybody heard them, but nobody
paid any attention to them.
The tone of the members shows that
charges must be specific or they will
not be considered, and this iSDroper.
There will be no lack of material even
under this rule. Subpenas have been
issued for Moses Gunst and E. F. Pres
ton, the former on the ground that he
said Burns had expended $19,000 on thÂ«
campaign, and the latter on the ground
that he heard the remark. Messrs. De
Young and Herrin must also appear,
and the last subpena issued for the day
called for the presence of Colonel
Burns. This was by request of Bur
nett, who pines for the particulars of
giving certain railway passes in the in
terest of his candidacy, this allegation
having appeared in The Call.
Daniel T. Cole was called for but had
been summoned to the city by reason
of illness in his family. As. Cole was
being sought Assemblyman Clough took
the stand and told about the letter he
had received from Daniel Cole, com
monly known, he said, as "Ole Dan
Cole." Judge Clough got excited, but
retained his .good temper while his
quaintness of speech kept the auditors
laughing. â  He told of the letter Cole
had sent containing an offer to advance
money for his campaign expenses, of
his own indignation and his reply,
which, I should think, trespassed some
what upon postal regulations concern
ing the character of mailable matter,
but it had evidently, touched Cole, Sow
deeply Cole can portray next week.
As Wright has confessed to having
done this, it is likely the recognition
given Clough by the chair will have a
stony glare . accompaniment. The
Wright episode is by all odds the scan
dal of the session so far. â¢ What the
future holds is a surmise which causes
apprehension to some, rouses the curi
osity of others and leads to the fear
that the investigation will be prolonged
to the hindrance of legislation. It la
not expected other defendants will con
fess with the nonchalance of a Wright,
and thus expedite the inquiry.
As to the Senatorial fight, I am un
able to write as I would wish. This
deadlock is getting deadly tiresome,
and the members are chafing at the de
lay. All sorts of breaks are predicted,
but I cannot imagine Burns men and
Grant men and Bulla men going openly
to any one candidate. This makes mo
think there will be a caucus, and I do
not find a Burns man who does not
think there will be one, and that it will
end In victory. It is apparently their
theory that many who are afraid to
stampede to Burns would do so if pro-:
tected by a secret ballot to express the
change of heart. On the other hand,
the' Barnes people are feeling good.
They claim that the Investigation has
already killed the chances of all tho
others who ever had a chance.
Milton Green ; will hardly be at the
bar of the House Monday for he is a
sick man, far sicker than when first
temporarily excused on the showing of
a doctor's certificate.2

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 21.â The committee of
â¢special investigation met this afternoon
at 2.30 in the Assembly chamber, with
six members present. Wade, as usual,
was the absentee. The following is a
verbatim report of the proceedings:
. Mr. Baconâ At the time the committee
adjourned I requested that Mr. Anderson
â¢.be recalled, and I would like to have him
recalled for a short examination. You
will remember I asked the right to recall
him.
â¢The chairmanâ l remember something
of- that kind. Ido not remember just
what it was.
' Alden Anderson recalled to the witness
stand, stifled as follows: '
Mr. Baconâ Now, 11 th* gentleman will
permit me, 1 would like to ask Mr. An
derson a few questions.
The chairmanâ Certainly, unless the
.committee order differently.
â¢Mr. Bacon Mr. Anderson, you were on
â the witness stand the other day?
â¢ ..A- Yes. sir.
â â¢;',Q. And during the course of your testi
mony you spoke of having had a con
-.yersation with Mr. Benjamin?
.A- Yes, sir.
â¢-..; Q. Who came to see you at Puisun?
â¢ ..A. Yes, sir.
-â¢. -Q. And afterward you had a conversa
tion with Mr. Green in San Francisco?
â¢â¢ A. Yes, sir.
â¢ -ft. I will call your attention to a ques
tion near the top of page 167 of the tran
script of the testimony, which is as fol
low.--: "Did that agent in Suisun inti
mate that if you received that money
â that it would be a part of the expecta
tion that you would vote for Mr. Grant?"
This is referring to a visit that was made
to you by Mr. Benjamin. Your answei i
id that question, as it is here, is that "1
.cannot remember that that consideration I
was ever expressly stipulated; that was
my understanding of it." Now you re- l
member testifying that way, do you, Mr. i
'Anderson?
â¢ A. Well. I really. â¢ far asâ my whole
i""' â :'â¢' was to say that, while he didn't
say- that he had express authority to
make that agreement, that was the im
plication all through the conversation.
Q. Well, thai was the implication that
you drew from It?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. But he never made any express state
ment at all of that kind, as I understand?
A. Not in regard to the financial part,
no, sir.
Q. He simply said that Mr. Green was
making Mr. Grant's fight and was willing
to defray the election expenses of mem
bersâof people who were running for the
Assemblyâ did he not?
;.Â£. Well, he said that {,â was willingâ
.. Q. That i.' was to advance money to
lielp pay expenses?
.'.A: Yes.
â¢ Q. And there was nothing, as you have
said before, there was nothing in his
conversation in which he said directly
that this proposition was made to you
wjth the understanding and with the
agreement that you should vote for Mr
Grant?
A. Not In regard to the financial part,
no.
Q. Well. then. Mr. Green asked youâ at
the time you had the conversation with
Mr. Green up in his officeâ lsn't it a fact
that you discussed with him about what
your elect expenses would be?
A . .No. sir; no, sir.
Q. Did not say anything about it?
A. No. sir.
Q. He did not ask you about that at all?
A. Not that I know of. I did not try to
enter into discussion with him at all. be
cause I did not want to discuss the ques
tion with him.
Q. Did not want to discuss it, then, at
all?
A. No, sir.
Q. He did not make a proposition to you
thereâ and 1 don't believe you say so,
either. I believe you also testified, in re
spect to that conversation of Mr. Green's
that what Mr. Green tried to do there was
to convince you that Mr. Perkinsâ
A. Yes. sir.
.Q. Senator Perkins wanted Mr. Grant to
succeed In his candidacy?
A. -Yes. sir. â ;â '. | : 'v-
Q. And he, also at the same time, in the
same conversation, said that he was will
ing to assist you in your election?
â¢â¢A. Yes. -Y:Y' ; y.YY\..yjj
. . Qr. And he did not make any direct prop
osition to youâ he?â at that time, that
would assist you in this election if you
would vote for Mr. Grant?
' 'A- No sirâ no; that is he did not express
itfn words.
â¢Q. I knowâ he didn't make any direct
proposition of that kind. All you did was
to draw your inference.
'â A; Yes, sir.
â¢' Q. There was no such statement, of any
such trade as that, made by Mr. Green?
A. I never bo stated.
Qi And you do not so state now?
A.* No, sir.
Mr. Baconâ l would like to ask you an
other question, Mr. Anderson, if the com
mittee will permit me. â¢â¢-
The chairmanâ ahead.
Mr. Baconâ What is your business, Mr.
Anderson?
A. I am in the fruit business. 1 raise and
Shipâ export.
Q. How often are you in San Francisco?
A. Sometimes twice a week; sometimes
I once a week.
Q. Do you know Mr. Herrin?
A. No. sir.
Q. Did you never see him?
A. Never saw him, to the best of mv
knowledge. J never saw him to know
him; wouldn't know him if I saw him
now.
Mr. Baconâ l do not think I desire to
cross-examine the witness any further,
and probably lt would not be seemly in
me.
The chairmanâ Mr. Anderson,
from what language or incident in con
nection with that interviewâ
The witnessâ What interview do you
mean?
Q.i Under discussion In this examination.
A. Mr. Benjamin? Is that right?
The chairmanâ Yes, with Mr. Benjamin.
Q. Did you draw the inference that you
have referred to?
A. Well he madeâ l guess I will have
to tell the whole business and make a
statement connecting therewith: Mr.
Benjamin Is an attorney in Vallejo and
comes to Suisun once in a whileâ Fairfield
is the county seatâ on business. Whether
he was at my office once or twice I can
not say. He may have dropped in there
casually. But at this time he came to see
me. My private secretary, who attends
to all my personal business and corre
spondence, Mr. Hilborn, was in the room
and was excused; and he came in there
and sat down and commenced to talk, and
told about people that he had seen and
then went on to tell that he thought Mr.
Grant would surely be the next United
States Senator anu that Mr. Green had
told him that if I needed any money up
there that I could have some in my dis
trict: and I immediately most positively
and emphatically told him that he, : know
ing me as well as be didâ my reputation
as I thought it was understoodâ should
have told him that such a proposition
would not be entertained by me. But he
went on to say that he had been in our
I county conveAon and that he thought
1 I Was under so*e obligations to him and
. that if Mr. Perkinsâ it was Mr. Perkins'
I wish that Mr. Grant should be the next
I Senator from the southâ and that if Mr.
Grant was the Senator Grant and Per
kins together could have a new office
established of United States Deputy Dis
trict Attorney and that the office would
be given to him.
Now, I am merely relating what hap
pened. This all occurred at the same con
versation, and the Inference was that he
I wished me to vote for Mr. Grant for that
purpose, to assist him, and that this
money would be given to me to assist me.
I wish at this time to say that In this
matter I have no personal feeling against
Mr. Grant. I honor and revere the name
of Grant as much as any American citi
zen doesâ his fatherâ and that Mr. Grant,
personally, at any time that he has been
brought or Introduced to meâ l have never
gone to him myselfâ has acted a perfect
I gentleman; and Mr. Perkins, it is not mv
belief that he-that Is my belief-that he
directly tried to influence any one.
The chairmanâ Mr. Perkins?
A. Yes; because after the election I
personally met Mr. Perkins on the street
here one day ,n Sacramento and I only
talked with him a minute or twoâ
Mr. Baconâ This thing, it seems to me,
ls assuming the character of argument.
The chairmanâ And eulogy.
The witnessâ You asked" me where I
*â' that inference. lam trying to tell you
that the inference was giver, me that Mr.
Perkins and Mr. Grant desired that; and
that another consideration would be a
position for my acquaintance, Mr. Ben
jamin, and that was all related at tho
same time as the conversation about the
money. That is where I got that infer
ence.
The chairman- At the time you met Mr
Green i! ? J his office in San Francisco after
the incident that you have mentioned
wherein you met Mr. Benjamin in your
office, was any reference made to the
conversation that you . had had with Ben
jamin?
,Â»,V V 'i V ? s ' sIr '. And - as I remember it. I
think I was in San Francisco once first,
an 2 1 re i' *iJ' e ?Â« a cardÂ£rom Mr, Green,
and I had that in my pocket when I, went
home, and 1 talked the thing over with
my private secretary, and he told me that
he wondered why Mr. Green wanted to
see me. supposing, of course; "that my
conversation had been reported to him
and he said maybe somebody else was
trying to get money from him on the
supposition that it was coming to me,
and he thought it was but lust that I in
form Mr. Green that, l did not want any
money, or not to pay any to anybody
else on my account. And the. next time
that I got a card from Mr. Green I went
up to his office and told him in as few
words as possible.
The chairmanâ You thought it was pos
sible somebody was trying to sell your
vote to Mr. Grant?
A. Yes. sir. V: â -.%
Q. Well, at that conversation - did Mr.
Green disclaim any responsibility for what
had been said to you?
A. I don't think that I went' into the
matter in detail. As I remember it, it was
Just casually mentioned. I wanted to
inform him that nobody had any authori
ty to speak for me, in any way or man
ner.
Q. W hat did Mr. Green say, If anything,
with reference to whether anybody had
authority to speak for him?
A. Well, I don't remember of _dm say
ln_- anything.
The chairmanâ Has the committee any
thing else to ask?
Mr. Baconâ l want to ask the gentle
man a question, and call his attention to
a question on page. 170 of this transcript,
!n which the following question is asked
and answered: "And at this interview
later, In Green's office, was anything said
by Mr. Green or yourself as to the fact
that Mr. Benjamin had seen you and con
ferred with you on that proposition?" And
the answer to that is. "I really don't re
member." Now, you remember it.
A. Weill, I say, as near as I can state
âI was called in there before the com
mittee without any thought about the
matterâas near as I can remember It was
casually referred to..
Q. Do you remember this question be
ing asked, which is following. "Don't you
remember that the incident occurring' in
the Sulsun office was referred to in the
conversation in Green's office?" Answer,
"No." __.'â¢__â  â ': yyy-yy..:.
A. I believe I do.
. Q. You so testified then? . _V
A. It wan only casually referred to.
Q. It was only casually referred to;
that was all? Now, don't you remember
that was not referred to at all?
A. It is my remembrance that it was
casually referred to; yes, sir.
Q. Now. then. Mr. Anderson, you say
that In this conversation with Mr. Ben
jaminâyou give details of that conversa
tion here to-day that you did not give
before, in which you say that Mr. Ben
jamin said that if Mr. Grant was elected
to the United States Senate there would
be an extra office created and that he
would be the beneficiary of that office.
Now, should not your inference have been
that Mr. Benjamin wanted you to vote for
Mr. Grant because possibly he might get
something out of It? "Would not that have
been a fair inference?
A. If he hadn't talked about this money
âand that he came from Mr. Green.
Q. That is right: but answer my ques
tion: Would not It be a great deal fairer
Inference that Mr. Benjamin wanted you
to vote for Mr. Grant because he would
be able to get some employment out of
it?
A. Well, my inference .was that they
were working together. *
Q. Will you answer my question: N If
too?
A. Why. of course I got an inference
that he was interested.
Q. Will you answer my question! Tf
you did not infer from that that he would
like to have you vote for Grant because
if you did and Grant were elected that he
might get to be Deputy District Attorney?
A. I got an inference that he was inter
ested.
Q. You won't answer my question, will
you? .â¢.:â¢..
A. I have answered it as near as I can.
Q. Will you answer it "yes" or "no"
whether you got such an Inference as
that?
A. Repeat your question again.
Q. The question is this: Did you not get
the inference from your conversation with
Mr. Benjamin that he wanted you to vote
for Mr. Grant because if Mr. Grant were
elected he would secure employment in
the way of an appointment as a Deputy
District, Attorney or the office that you
mentioned?
A. I have got an inference, yes, along
with the other.
Q. Yes,- you inferred that?
A. Along with the other one.
Q. Now. Mr.. Green, in your conversa
tion with him in his office, did. not -say
anything about. Mr. Benjamin being Dep
uty District Attorney? v-!
A. No, sir, he did not.
Q. It was not referred to? '-â¢.;-. ..'.
A. No, sir.
Q. Did not say anything about Mr. Ben
jamin's aspiration at all?
A. No, sir. ' â  â¢ -;â¢â  â â â 
Q. In fact, the conversation that you j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY -22, 1899.
had with Mr. Benjamin was not referred
to by Mr. Green especially, so far as you
say. anything about the details of what
that conversation was?
A. If it was referred to it was merely
casualâ just that this conversation was
had with him and I wanted him to un
derstand that there was , not ; any money
needed there.
Q. Now. this testimony that you have
given in answer to the questions by the
chairman is to show to this committee
why it was that you drew the inference
that you testified to the other day â is
that it?
A. Draw your own inference from the
testimony. ... . _
Q. Draw my own inference from the
testimony? Well, you can answer my
question. Tou have given this testimony,
and, as I understand it. is is for the pur
pose of showing to this committee why
you say you got the inference that you
did in your testimony the other day. is it
not?
A. I have related the whole Incident as
I then did. "
Q. What for? What did you relate it
for? You related it in answer to the
questions put to you by the chairman,
didn't yoy?
A. Yes, sir. : ; ,;.. ,
Q. In which he asked you what the cir
cumstances were that caused you to draw
this inference? Isn't that true? And then
you related those circumstances?
A. Yes. If you want my secretary I will
be pleased to get him, or if you want any
gentleman that Mr. Benjamin talked with.
The chairmanâ Were these conversa
tions, any of them, in the presence of any
other person?
A. Not directly; but my private secre
tary was excused from the room.
Q. He was not present, then?
A. No; but he knows what was said
after he left. - iy\ â â¢'â â '
The chairmanâ Mellick, there is a
matter that I desire to call your attention
to. Unless your motion to reconsider the
matter of the issuance of those subpenas
the other night is pressed, those subpe
nas will be ordered. '. ," / .
Mr. Mellickâ What subpenas, Mr. Chair
man?
The chairmanâ There are the subpenas,
as I remember them, for M. H. de loung,
William F. Herrin, John D. Spreckels. C.
G. Lamberson and Judge Wylie. That
Wylle matter, I think, is altogether su
perfluous, but the Lamberson matter l
think Is of some consequence.
Mr. Mellickâ Take them up separately,
cannot you? Take the Lamberson case.
The chairmanâ ln the case of Lamber
son, to reconsider that I hope the motion
won't be pressed. ' â  ..
Mr. Mellickâ l will withdraw the motion
as to that.
The chairmanâ The clerk will issue a
subpena for Charles G. Lamberson of
Visalla. How about Mr. de Young? Thus
far the history of the committee has been
that anybody that asked for a subpena
has got ltâ has got it on rumor or what
ever it was. My own feeling, gentlemen
of the committee. Is this: That we ought
not. probably, to have been as free in
that matter as we have been in the past,
and that the same amount of freedom
should not be taken in the future.
Mr. Lardnerâ feel that the time is
about to come when the taking up of
every idle rumor, without the name of
the party is given, should be discontin
ued. That is how I feel about it. If the
person will come forward and give the
name and the place of the conversation,
so we can be reasonably sure of some
thing, it would be different; but mere idle
rumor and a refusal to give the name I
view that with some reluctance, with
some doubts.
Mr. Mellickâ Do you refer to the Lam
berson case?
Mr. Lardnerâ No, I do not.
Mr. Mellickâ l just want to say to put
myself on record in the Lamberson capeâ
I want to put my statement this way:
Personally I think it is absolutely useless
to send for Lamberson, but if the rest of
you wish to send for him, send.
Mr. Lardnerâ State your reasons why.
Mr. Mellickâ the reasons, that Mr.
Bacon's statement' to this committee was
that some person whom he- could not re
member had . said , that . Lamberson H said
that Mr. Cosper had said something.
Now, then, that is- the reason why I don I
think that he should be sent for. .., '
Mr. Bacon-No, I did not say. it that
way Mr. Mellick. -'I don't think you had
better discuss that any more. ' â¢
Mr. Melllck-r-It is none of your business
whether. l discuss it or not. â 
Mr. Bacon-All right. I will tell you
what I said. then.
Mr. Mellickâ Well, say it. y
Mr. Baconâ l will. What is the use to
rehearse that? I do not care to adver
tise that thing any further. Mr. Mellick.
It is in the record what I said and what
you said, and there is no use taking up the
time of the committee discussing it.
Mr. Mellickâ lt is none of your business
whether I take up the time of the commit
tee or not. y ! \ _
Mr. Baconâ l guess that is true. Go on
and "take it up. - . * â  , . !,','*
Mr. Mellickâ As I say. I just simply put
my protest in, and if the rest of you want
him, why. all right. ; .
Mr La Bareeâ l think it is settled in re
gard to Mr. Lamberson. and probably in
regard to these other propositions, I
think after thisâ I make the motion
to this effectâ that If any more accusa
tions are made they be in writing. I of
fer a resolution to that effect.
The chairmanâ l do not know how the
committee feels on that proposition. It
strikes me like this: The word "accusa
tion" Is a strong one. I do not feel as if
it ought to be incumbent upon this com
mittee to Insist that a written accusation
should be made before a witness is sent
for to prove anything; but if a man comes
forward here and in writing states cer
tain facts that he expects to prove and
gives the names of the individuals by
whom he expects to prove them, it seems
to me that ought to be as strong an ac
cusation as we need. y- â  -
Mr. La Barer â Well, then, I amend my
motion to that effect.
The chairmanâ ls there a second?
Mr. Lardner- I second the motion. â  v ?i
The chairmanâ Then I will state the
question this way and see if you agree
with me upon it: It is moved and sec
onded that henceforth when we call wit
nesses by issuance of subpenas It shall
be only upon a written statement of the
matter expected to be proved, together
with the names of the persons by whom
they expect to prove those facts. Are
there any remarks?
Mr. Mellickâ Don't you think it would
be well to put that thing in writing in
the case of Spreckels and Mr. Herrin and
Mr. de Young?
The chairmanâ l do as far as I am per
sonally concerned. You ask in regard
to meâ l am only one.
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Chairman. I can see
some reason why we should have Mr.
Herrin and Mr. Spreckelsâ l mean Mr.
Herrin and Mr. de Youngâ a little reason
in it, by reason of that same Call article
saying that our Speaker had gotten $SOO
from Mr. Herrin. although I think It
ought to have been brought up here, con
necting Burns with It. or something, but
the committee has overruled me and is
going to Issue the subnenas anyhow. But
in the case of Spreckels we haven't any
statement'here that he knows anything in
the case except that Mr. Burnett stated
the other day that Leake referred to some
higher authority knowing something, and
thought that must be Mr. Spreckels.
Mr. Burnettâ Chairman, as I under
stand It. subpenas to those gentlemen are
already, Issued, and they were simply held
over to give Mr. Mellick a chance to â
Mr. Mellickâ And I moved a reconsidcra-
tion. y. y*y. â 
Mr. Burnettâ on?
Mr. Mellick â Issuing these.
Mr. Burnettâ All of them?
Mr. Mellickâ Yes. .
Mr. Burnettâ Now. your own statement
in regard to Herrin and De Young Is
sufficient to subpena â¢ them. That very
chargeâ that very statement that Mr.
Wright had gone to Mr. Herrin and asked
for $1200 but had secured only $800, that is
sufficient, entirely sufficient, so far as
those two are concerned.
The chairmanâ l agree with Mr. Mellick
that there is sufficient ground to subpena
Herrin .and, Do Young. Gentlemen, are
there any further remarks upon the ques
tion? I will say to Mr. Mellick, in that
connection, that your . motion to recon
sider would not be in order now, until
this is disposed of. "-.>.â¢--
Mr. Mellickâ What is the question?
The chairmanâ lt. has been moved that
henceforth when subpenas are to be is
sued they are to he issued only upon a
written statement setting forth the facts
that the person calling for the subpena
expects. to prove, together with the names
of the ' persons by, whom \ they expect to
prove them. .... . â â -â :â -..
Mr. Mellickâ Now, Mr. ; Chairman, will
that apply to. members of the committee
as well? If we want, or any member of
the committee wants to subpena any
body, we write it out and file it with the
committee? y '. :â â  ... â¢ . ~
The chairmanâ Yes. with the clerk.
i Mr. Mellickâ Well, I am in favor of that
understanding.
The chairmanâ point you make is
this: That we are not to take all these
idle rumors, but if a man had a rumor
strong enough, that he has faith in it
sufficient to say here: "I want a John
Doe subpena." setting forth the facts.
Mr. Mellickâ That is all right, because
it will give any member of this committee
a chance to file that, and consider it, in
stead of going off, as appeared to me the
other night, in issuing subpenas in this
way.
The motion was put and declared car
ried. ._
Mr. Alden Andersonâ I understand
that there is no denial of the tact that
money was offered to me, and that it was
absolutely refused?
A memberâ That has not been denied.
Mr. Andersonâ Then there is no use for
me to summon any corroborative testi
mony. ' .
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Green admitted that he
offered you money.
Mr. Andersonâ Then it will be unneces
sary for me to do so. y\_'Y -â¢-- -VV"

Q. Have you with you the paper in
which the charge is made in the Los An

for a vote for Bulla?
A. No. sir. I thought I had it. but I
find in going through my pockets that I
have lost it. Â»
iQ. Do you know of any such transac
tion?

A. I would prefer, Mr. Chairman, that
you wouldn't ask me that question. While
anything that. I might relate, I under
stand, was not given to me in absolute
confidence, still, as a newspaper man, I
think the gentleman is entitled to. some
consideration from me," and -""believe "that
the statement has been made in such a
way that the committee can arrive 'at the
name of the Assemblyman without my
giving the information. '
Q. I presume the committee would be
willing to let you off on that proposition if
you put us in the way of learning it. in
any other way. If you can do. so, you
may do it. ...
', A. There is a gentleman â of this com
mittee, Mr. Mellick, who claims to have
the information as to the sourceâ as to my
authority. â¢ â  .â¢...-. ; Â ..
Mr. Mellickâ l was just running a bluff
on you. Mr. Washburn. (â¢â â â¢' '
The witnessâ Don't run bluffs on me.
Mr. Mellickâ Was Mr. Dale the man?
A. I must request that the committee
do not ask me the direct- name of my in
formant. I hardly. think it is proper for a
newspaper man to betray a confidence,
even If it is not requestedâ
t Q. Did Mr. Belshaw talk to you in re
gard to the same matter? . v
A. I have talked : with Mr. Belshaw in
regarcr to.the matter and he has tola me
practically the same story. ...
Q. Then, putting it another, way, did
not Mr. Belshaw speak to you about it
being Mr. Dale? .
A. Mr. Belshaw said that he had a con
versation with the gentleman with whom
I discussed this subject. - .v â¢ â  . -
Q. Well, did not he say that he had the
conversation â < with Mr. Dale? ' '-â  â¢ _
A. I believe that he did say that he had
a conversation with Mr. Dale. ... ; '.;
Q. Then what did Belshaw say? .Jyy
Mr. Baconâ l think, Mr. Mellick, that
would be entirely hearsay.
Mr. Mellick â Belshaw Is a member of
the Assembly. â¢ Â
The witnessâ the committee will per
mit me. I think the better way would be
to put Mr* Belshaw on the stand and let
him state what he heard.
Mr. " Mellickâ His statement would be
corroborative, yes.
The witnessâ l am willing to furnish the
committee with any information I have.
Q. What did Mr. Belshaw say to you
about the matter?
A. Mr. Belshaw said that he had a con
versation- with Mr.-Dale,- in which he ask
ed him whether any offer had been made
to him, and Mr. Dale stated that some
financial offer had been made to him.
Q. Mr. Dale had told him?
A. Yes, had told him. .
Q. Did he speak about it being $3000?
A. He did not.
Q. Well, then I do not see as there is
anything secret about it.
A. I don't understand that there is any
thing secret about it. The story, as I am
informed, has been told to at least two
Assemblymen and possibly one or two
outsiders. I simply request that tint com
mittee do not ask the name of my in
formant, the man who gave me the In
formation. â¢
Q. Now, what was the conversation that
you had with your informant? .
A. I went to him before the Assembly
.met and sat beside him in the seat, asked
him if there was anything new In the sit
uation, whether there was any prospect of
a change in the votes, and. while I do not
recall what he said in that respect I think
he made the statement that he did not
know of anything. Then he said to mo.
he says: "Jimmie Copeland has been try
ing to get me to vote for Bulla." I says:
"Yes?" He says: "Yes, he came to me
on the street and asked me if I was ab
solutely tied up, and I told him no. I did
not understand that I was tied. Then he
said, if such was the case to not make
any promise, or words to that effect, but
arrange to vote for Bulla for second
choice."
Mr. Mellickâ Did he say to you that he
had been offered $3000?
A. This gentleman did not make that
statement to me.
Q. Did he say any amount? .: -
A. I says: "What inducement did he
hold out?" or words to that effect.
"Well," he said, "he said he would fix lt
for me; he could arrange it all right for
me." I says: "You mean a monetary
consideration?" He said: "Yes."
Q. Now give us the conversation.
A. "What conversation? I have related
the conversation I had with him.
Q. Relate it word for word, as near as
you can.
A. Well, I say that I went to him be
fore the Assembly mej:. â 
Q. No, no. I don't mean the particulars.
The conversation right after he spoke of
Jimmie Copeland.
A. You mean my conversation with this
Assemblyman or his conversation with
Copeland? '
Mr. Mellickâ No, no. Your conversation
with this Assemblyman. He said that
Jimmie Copeland met him on the street,
did he?
A. Yes.
Q. Then what did he say?
A. Copelandâ mind, now, I am repeat
ing this now to, the best of my recollec
tion. I won't vouch for the accuracy of
the language that either of us used; and
1 also wish to state that I do not consider
this statement I am relating now was one
made In confidence, because there was no
request made of me that I should regard
it as confidential. He said to me: "Cope
land asked me if I was absolutely tied
up, and I saidâ or some such wayâ
I was not; did not consider myself tied,
or words to that effect. "Well," he says,
"don't make any arrangements, then:
you stand to vote for Bulla for second
choice tor something of that kind) and
,we will make it all right with you."
Q. Then what did you say?
A. You mean this otherâ
Q. No; right after he said that, what
did you say? .":-â 
A. I says, "Did he offer you any con
sideration?" I says, "What consideration
did he offer?" "Well." he says, "he said
he would fix it for meâ make it all right
with me." I says, "Do you mean by that
money consideration?" He said, "Yes."
:-. Q. Then what did you say, or did he
say? ;â â¢;â : - -..."â  â -...-. â â  â â 
; A. Well, I cannot recollect whether the
Assembly was on the point of meeting,
but I do know .what I had In my own
mind, and it was this: That before I
pressed the question j any further with
him I would endeavor to see â¢ Copeland
and try. to get the information about the
$3000. I went downtown after the Assem
bly had adjourned, looked for Copeland,
and could not find him; arid, in the pres
sure .Of- getting out Ay- copy early
that evening. I let the thing go untilâ
I should fancy it was 1 or 2 o'clock In the
morning. I was sitting in the lobby of
the Golden Eagle Hotel and a certain par
ty came to me and said that this Assem
blyman had told him that he had been
ottered $3000 to vote for Bulla for second
choice.' '; . , .
Q. That this Assemblyman that you had
talked toâ yyyy >;:.';â¢'
A. Yes
Q. Mr. 'Dale? . V
â¢ A. I do not mention his name. I was
told that this Assemblyman told this par
ty that he had been offered $-000 to vote
for Huber for second choice.
Q. Bulla, you mean. Instead of Huber.
A.I said: "That is what he told me,
with the exception that he did not specify
the amount." , -
Q. And was that certain party in the
Golden Eagle Hotel an Assemblyman?
Then that was another of the indefinable
rumors going around that you based your
story on? . . . .
A. I thought possibly there might be
some mistake' in the amount, because I
did not know Mr. Jimmie Copeland could
raise $3000 unless he had the Southern
Pacific Railway sack at his back, or was
working for Dan Burns, and I went to this
Assemblyman next morning and put the
question to him directly in this way, so
I didn't think there could be any mistake
about it. I said: "When Copeland offered
you this $3000 you refused it; did he raise
the price?" and the Assemblyman says
"No." " "' . â_
Q. And how long since Jimmie Cope
land was an attorney for the Southern
Pacific Railroad? "â '_""'_:â¢
A. Well, now, when I say that he was
an attorney I cannot swear that positive
ly. I have been told that he had railroad
cases among his other business, and what
ever statements I made In that respect,
as far as I know, are hearsay.
Q, You do not know whether he was
ever an attorney or not?
A. I could not state that of my own
knowledge.
Q. In the article you refer to a pay car
being here. What do you mean by that?
A. Oh, that is simply a josh.
Q. The Assemblyman mentioned ho sum
whatever?
A. Not at that time.
Q. And he did not tell you that Cope
land mentioned any sum of money?
A. Did not tell me that at that time."
Q. Well, did you see Dale after this,
then, and talk with him about tne same
case?
A. I have seen Mr. Dale several times.
Q. Did you talk with him about this
same case? Did you ask him more about
it? Did you see him again about this?
A. I do not see how I could say that I
saw Mr. Dale again about this case when
I did not state that Mr. Dale 'was the
man I spoke to.
Q. This same Assemblyman, then?
A. Yes; I have discussed with this same
Assemblyman this same case.
Q. What did he tejl you the next time?
A. Well, we did not go into that fea
ture of it. At that time when I put this
question to him the second morning,
"When Jimmie Copeland offered you this
$3000 and you refused it, did he raise the
price?" he went on .to sayâ he answered
the question, "No." and, he says, "I am
sorry that I told you that yesterday." He
says: "There have been one or two
newspaper men , come to me and
asked me in regard to this case," and he
says, "I have said nothing about it."
"Well, but," I said to him, "if Copeland
is making these offers," I says, "yours is
not the only vote in the Assembly." I
says: "He certainly must want other
people besides yourself, and he must have
made a similar offer to some other
party." I says: "The statement will get
out, and some one will be Interested in
taking it before the Investigating com
mittee,' and the story will come out any
way." "Well," he says, "I think possibly
it may.' I gathered the Inference from
thatâ it is the only Inference that I
haveâ this Assemblyman did not care
to have me mention his name, and I have
respeected his confidence to that extent;
and I have not touched upon the story,
except in the way in which you have seen
in the Times, and the only statement I
have had with him regarding it since is
what, he has volunteered! himself in my
presence. ... '
. Q. Did he ever, In any conversation with
you,- mention to you that he had been
offered any definite sum of money?'
A. He mentioned in my presence, and
In the presence of another gentleman ln
the Golden Eagle last night, that he had
been offered that sum.
Q. What sum?
A. $3000. -'â >;-;
Q. He said last night that he had been
offered $3000?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. By James Copeland?
A. By James Copeland.
Q. Who was this other gentleman?
A. Well, I will ask the chairman if he
thinks It is necessary that I answer that
question.
The chairmanâ Well, that is a matter
for the committee to decide.
Mr. Mellickâ lt seems to me that this is
no confidence to be respected. I am will
ing that he should not tell the name of
that Assemblyman. Being a newspaper
man myself, I appreciate the confidence
that a newspaper man must have. But
here he Is in the presence of a third
party and in the Golden Eagle Hotel, and
I do not think that that is a confidence to
be respected at all. I think the third
party ought to be mentioned.
The chairmanâ As a matter of law,
neither party is protected from a state
ment of facts before such an Investiga
tion as this. If there is no objection to
that, it Is so ordered. You will be obliged
to answer and state the third party's
name, Mr. Washburn.
A. Captain Barbour of San Diego.
Mr. Mellickâ ls he in the city now?
A. I think so.
Q. Now then, Mr. Washburn, relate the
conversation that you had last night in
detail.
A. Well, as a matter of fact, there was
so very little of it that I cannot relate
anything more to say than that this As
semblyman said that a false Impression
had gotten out that he had said that the
money came from Bulla. He said: "I
never made any such statement.".' He
said: "I never accused Mr. Bulla of pass
ing out this money." lie said:. "I never
thought such a thing." He said: "My
understanding of it was that this money
was offered to me to keep Mr. Bulla in
the fight. For instance, if he should lose
a vote, that there might be a vote ready
to take its olace," and he said: "When
Jimmy Copland offered me the $3000 I
did not understand that the money came
from Bulla." Â
Q. Then what did you say?
A. I didn't say anything.
Q. That was the extent of the conver
sation? . -
A. So far as I recollect it.
Q. Did Barbour say anything then?
A. No. YY.-Y
Q. What else do you know about this
case, Mr. Washburn?
A. This Bulla case?
Q. Yes.
A. Well, I do not know that I know
anything. I will leave. It with the rest of
the committee; there are a whole lot of
rumors. â¢ y^y'
Q. Did you not tell a gentleman in the
Golden Eagle Hotel the other night that
the policy of the Times was to defeat
Bulla in any Instance?
A. I don't remember that I stated any
thing of the kind, but I think the columns
of the Times will be the best evidence
that they. do not want Mr. Bulla to be
United States Senator.
Q. Did you not say that to a gentleman
in the Golden Eagle Hotel? '
A. I cannot recall any conversation of
that kind.
Mr. Mellickâ Well. I do not know as that
makes any difference in this investigation.
That is all, 1 think. Now, Mr. Chairman.
I do not understand that we are leaving
Mr. Washburn go for goodâ / under
standing being that it was Assemblyman
Dale. Now, then, we get Assemblyman
Dale and Captain Barbour here. Here is
a direct charge-nine that we must trace
down. After we have gotten Assembly
man Dale here and he does not prove to
be the man with whom he had the conver
sation I am not willing that Mr. "Washburn
should be let go from giving the Assem
blyman's name. .-â â â â â  â  â 
.Motion was made that a subnena be
issued for Dale and Barbour. Seconded
and carried. - '
The chairmanâ Gentlemen, I have a
communication to call your attention to:
â yy-::- . . - "January 21, 1899.
"To the i Chairmanâ Dear Sir: It has
been stated that D. M. Burns expended
the sum of $19,000 to secure the election
of members of the present Legislature.
A statement .; was made by Mose Gunst
of San Francisco to Mr. E. F. Preston.
Mr. Preston has expressed his . willing
ness to appear before your committee, if
so ordered, and to testify to the conver
sation between himself and Mr. Gunst.
I respectfully request that you. issue. sub
penas to secure the attendance before
your committee .of Mr. Gunst and Mr.
Preston. . Â.â  -,_ L. L. LEVINGS."
Now that - contains substance enough to
justify a subpena by the committee, but
It is not in the form we ask. Now, I sug
gest that -he form that we desire is this..
I suggest that we return this to Mr. ***=Â»"â 
ings with the recommendation ; that ne*
put it into the form of a statement that,
he expects to prove by Mr. Preston and
Mr. Gunst certain things and cite them.
Because, if we depart from our rule, we
are going to have all manner of trouble.
. The communication was returned to Mr.
Levings for revision. t
J. H. BAEBOTJR .TESTIFIES. .
J. H. Barbour, being sworn, testified as
follows: , â  â 
Mr. Mellickâ Captain Barbour, will you
give your full name?
A. J. H. Barbour.
Q. W here do you live?
A. San Diego. _ ' .
Q. Were you in the Golden Eagle Hotel
last night in conversation with Assembly
man Dale and Mr. Washburn of the
Times? / Yyy.
A. I was in the Golden Eagle Hotel last
night and met those gentlemen; yes, sir.
Q. Was there a conversation with re
gard to Assemblyman Dale's vote chang
ing to Bulla?
A. Was there a conversation?
Q. Yes.
A. I do hot recall distinctly whether
there was any conversation directly with
regard to his change. I think a remark
was made, though, something to this ef
fectâthat in case he changed, it was ex
pected that some one el* would change
from Mr. Bulla to make up for Mr.
Bulla's strength. :.
2. Assemblyman Dale said that?
A. I do not remember whether it was
Mr. Dale or Mr. Washburn.
Q. Then what did Mr. Washburn sayâ
or whichever one it was?
A. In the conversation there, there was
no specific conversation with regard to
this matter at all. It was a casual talk,
the character of which I do not definitely
recall. I paid no particular attention to
it. Titer-! are so many rumors passing
around th.it I regarded this as one of the
numerous rumors that we hear all the
while with .regard to anybody and every
body. __
Q Did Assemblyman Dale say that he
had been offered $3000 by an attorney by
the name of Copeland?
A. I do not think so, sir. Not to my
recollection. - _âââââ
Q. Did he say anything about $3000?
A I do not recall that he mentioned
any specific sum at all. or that any in
ducement had been offered at all. Still
he might have m_\de some remark of
that kind. As I tell you. there are so
many rumors coming to us here that I
paid' but very little attention to the talk.
I was not there for th.i purpose of an In
terview or being interviewed at all. H
Q. About what hour was this last night?
A. I should think somewhere about
midnight. . â¢ â  â¢â â¢
Q. In the lobby or in the saloon?
A. My recollection is that it was in the
saloon.
Q. Did you hear any Assemblyman,
whether Mr. Dale or anybody else, say
anything about being offered $3000 to
change his vote? â¢> *
A. 1 do not think so, sir. I have heard
the common rumors since the publication
in the Times, and probably talked of it
with numerous parties, but that any spe
cific statement of that kind has been made
by anybody in a definite way I do not re
call. I think. none has ever been made to
me.
Q. Ido not understand. Is it your recol
lection that $3000 was not mentioned in
that conversationâ ln that interview at
all?
A. I do not think so. At the same time
I would not swear positively that it may
not have been mentioned.
Q. Was it mentioned any other time
$3000â when Mr. Washburn was present?
A. I could not say. sir.
Q. Or when Mr. Washburn was not
present? 'â¢'
A. As I tell you, I have heard the com
mon rumor since the publication was
made in the Times a number of times;
possibly have heard it. mentioned by half
a dozen people. ho they were or the
circumstances under which it was men
tioned I could not give you now.
Q. Was anything sain in that conversa
tion about the money possibly coming
from Colonel . Burns or pis friendsâCol
onel Burns or Colonel Burns' friends?
A. Not to my recollection. .
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Washburn, do you
want to ask him any questions? -
Mr. Washburnâ No.
The chairmanâ Barbour, you
have known that the air was rife with
stories about bribery and the sale of
votes the last .few days, have you not?
A. Yes, sir; full of them.
Q. Are they so common that you would
not remember the fact that the charge
of bribery was made in your presence?
A. I think if any distinct charge of
bribery of any individual member of the
Assembly had been made in my presence
in a definite way I would certainly recall
it.
Q. You are a friend of the candidate
named R. N. Bulla, are you not?
A. A friend?
Q. Yes.
A. I never met Mr. Bulla until the last
few days In mv life.
Q. Whose candidacy are you supporting
by your influence?
A. Mv Influence is so limited that I
doubt if it is available in anybody's can
didacy. I came up here as a neighbor and
friend of Â»tr. Grant's to do anything I
might be afire to in his behalf.
Q. That being a fact, you are seeking to
aid in any way you might, in your weak
way and manner, as you suggest. If any
charge of bribery had been made in your
presence do you think you would remem
ber it?
A. I say if any distinct and definite
charge had been made in my presence I
should remember it. ..'.._
Q. You understood that to be a sugges
tion of bribery, did you?
A. Understood what to be?
Q. That conversation there between the
Assemblyman, yourself and Mr. Wash
burn? .
A.I did not understand that any specific
charge of bribery was made of anybody
or by anybody. What I understood was if
anything of the kind was said that it was
one of the common rumors that are. cur
rent all the while in regard to yourself
and everybody else. .". ..'- y'> :
Q. Was this conversation at that time
directed against any particular individ
ual? Was it not directed against R. N.
Bulla? , .
A Well, the only suggestion that I re
call that would reflect in any way upon
Mr. Bulla was that an arrangement had
possibly been made to keep his vote good.
Q. Keep his vote good?
A. Yes.
Q. By what means?
A By throwing sufficient strength to
him- if he lost any, to keep his vote good.
Q ell, that far it would be all right,
would it not?
A. I think so. -%
Q. Now then, was there any suggestion
in that conversation, or was there not a
suggestion that Mr. Bulla or some au

A. Not that I recall, sir.
Q. Will you state to the committee
â¢whether there was or was not such a
suggestion of a moneyed consideration
: for keeping the vote good?
A. Well. Mr. Chairman, as I said In the
beginning, the conversation ran on in a
casual way, and I paid comparatively lit
tle attention to it, and 1 think you are
now making a mountain out of a molehill,
ii you will permit me to say so. I do
not recall that any suggestion was made
of any money being paid at all. Such a
suggestion may have been made. I am
not prepared to Bay it was not; such a
statement may have been made, but ther,
' are hundreds of those statements made
every day in the presence of almost every
gentleman here. Â»
â¢ Mr. Mellickâ Captain Barbour. Mr.
Washburn was on the stand just a little
bit ago, and he said that a certain As
semblyman last night, in your presence,
sain that he hail been offered by James .
Copeland $300. for his vote to go to Bulla. I
Nov, this was no Idle rumor. There was
an Assemblyman In your presence who
admitted having been offered $3000, ac
cording to Mr. Wushburn's testimony.
A. If you will permit me, Mr. Wash
burn is responsible for his testimony and
I for mine.
y. I want to get this: Did you hear any
such conversation?
y A. I cannot say positively that no 'such
; thing was said, and I am certain that I
do not recall it being said. It may have :
.' been said.
Q. Well, if it had been said it would not '
come under the category of those inde- i
. finable rumors that you speak of, because !
there was a direct statement by an As
semblyman.
A. If it had been said in my presence so
that I distinctly understood that it was a
charge of bribery I would have remem
bered it.
Q. And you did not hear any such state
ment?
...A. Not to the best of my recollection.
- Q. Captain Barbour, if it had been said !
. at that time when that conversation was
going on would you have heard it?
â¢ â  A. I have already testified, 1 think, that I
it may have been said and that the con
versation in my mind was a repetition i
â¢ largely of rumors and that if said it was j
. said in such a way that 1 regarded it i
merely as a rumor and that it did not fix
itself in my memory. 1 cannot say
Whether such a remark may not have
â¢ been made, and made in my presence.
- Q. You do not answer my question yet. i
A. I tried to.
y. Were you in such a position that you ;
could have heard that conversation if it
had taken place?
A. My recollection is that part of
the time I stood close enough
to those two gentlemen to have
heard any such remark If It had been ad
dressed by one to the other of them and
that part of the time I was distant far
enough so that I might not have heard
if lt had been made. 1 am confident
that no such remark was made directly
to me. ,
Q. Did you hear all the conversation
that took place at that time between Mr.
Washburn and Assemblyman Dale?
A. I left their presence and went to bed
left the two gentlemen standing together
before they had finished their conversa
tion.
y. You heard all the conversation up
until the time you left, did you not?
A. I am not prepared to say that I didâ
no, sir.
y. Were you and Assemblyman Dale
talking together when Mr. Washburn
came up? -
A. That is, which of us were talking
together first?
y. Yes.
A. Well, I think we practically all came
together at once.
V- You heard the first part of the con
versation?
. A. Yes, I think the first part I heard,
y. Then what was the last thing said
just before you left?
A. Oh, I could not undertake to say,
'.ir; a whole lot of things talked about,
â¢;. Q. How long did you talk together?
A. Perhaps ten minutes.
y. Did you hear everything that was be
' ing said during that ten minutes that you
â -. were â¢her?
A. I do not know, sir. I told you what
' I heard as near as I remember; that is all.
Q. Were you not in a position so that
. you could hear everything that was going
on?
-â¢ A. Not all the time.
Q. Or that you did hear everything?
A. Not all the time.
â â  . Q. What interfered?
A. Why, We were too distant. The fact
Is, as I told you, that I regarded the talk
there as part of the superficial talk that
â¢was about, and I paid comparatively litâ
tle attention to it.
â¢ Q. But here, according to the testimony,
â¢ Is a direct statement by an Assemblyman
-.that a certain amount was offered him;
so that it could not have been one of the
... undefinable rumors that you speak about.
â 'â¢'â¢A. I do not think a distinct statement
that bo much money was offered to him
'"was made in my presence. At the same
'.time it may have been.
y. Or any amount? Well, why could
you not have remembered it if it took
. place?
A. Because It was not sufficiently defi
nite to fix my attention as a criminal
' charge.
-. â¢ Mr. Baconâ You did not know, Mr. Bar
â bour, at that time that Mr. Washburn
and Mr. Dale had ever had any conver
sation before this on the same subject,
' did you?
- A. I knew that Mr. Washburn had pub
lished in the Times an article in refer
ence to this matter.
y. You did not know whether he ever
had a conversation with him?
A. With Mr. Dale?
Q. Yes; had personal knowledge of the
â  fact?
A. Not of my own knowledge; no, sir.
Q. But what you had seen in the pa
per?
A. No.
Mr. Mellickâ Well, captain, you saw
that in the paper, did you not?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. ln the paper did not it say that a
definite amount had been paid?
A. Oh. yes.
Q. Did not the paper say that he had
been talking to a certain legislator?
A. I think so. : : !
y. And did you not understand as you
read that article that that man was As
semblyman Dale?
A. No, sir; I do not think I can say
â¢ .that.
Q. After he had spoken to or talked
with him in your presence last night tnen
â¢ did you not understand that it was As
sembly Dale?
A. I do not recall just where I got the
â  first impression that this offer, if made, ,
â '. had been made to Assemblyman Dale; but
â¢ I certainly am clear that the impression ,
: was in my mind that, if such a proposition
had been made, It was to Assembly
man Dale. Now, whether I got that im
*' pression through reading the paper or
' from the common talk about the hotel,
or from some remark that may have been
.made there, I am not clear.
Q. Was there some reference last night
In the conversation to this article written
'. 1 â ;.- Mr. Washburn in which it was said
. .that a certain legislator had been offered
â¢â¢$.000?
â¢â¢â¢ A. I do not think so.
Q. Was there reference to that In that
conversation last night?
â¢ A. I do not think so. I think the con
versation opened by my remarking to Mr.
Washburn in a jocular way that he was
.'Still out of jail: he hadn't been committed
' for contempt, or something of that kind.
The chairmanâ Are there any further
..'questions that any member of the com
mittee would like to ask? If not, you will
.â¢â¢be excused, Mr. Barbour. Now, gentle
â¢' men, I will read you this communication:
"I expect to prove that D. M. Burns ex
.â¢ pended $19,000 to secure the election of
â¢ . members of the present Legislature, and
this money was expended in a manner not
â¢..recognized by law. I expect to establish
this proof by the testimony of Hon. B. F.
'Preston and Mose Gunst, and respectfully
request that your committee Issue subpe

â¢ before your honorable committee to the
' end that the facts may be established.

.' Mr. Mellickâ Suppose Mr. Preston is
. brought up here and Mose Gunst and
' they fall down in their testimony here, we
will just simply be made laughing stock
of ourselves; that is all.
The chairmanâ You cannot afford to be
anxious about who will laugh at you.
Mr. Mellickâ l can afford to be anxious
anxious about my own acts.
" The chairmanâ Oh, I don't know-

ties of Plumas, Lassen and Sierra.
Q. Are you acquainted with Milton J.
Green?
A. I am not. I do not know as I ever
met him. , _
Q. Do you know Ulysses S. Grant Jr?
A. I have met him since I came to Sac
ramento.
Q. Only?
A. Only.
Q. Do you know Daniel Cole?
A. I do. Daniel T. Cole, generally known
as old Dan Cole.
Q. Did you ever receive a letter from
Daniel Cole offering you financial assist
ance in your race for the Assembly?
A. I would have to answer that by dis
closing contents of the letter.
Q. Well, that comes later.
A. Comes later?
Q. Did you receive such a letter? â -
A. I received a letter from Dan T. Cole.
Q. Have you that letter?
A. J have not.
Q. Do you know where it Is?
A. I do not. . ...
Q. Do you know whether it is destroyed?
A. I do not. 1 will state to you. how
ever that in general 1 answered all letters
relating to political matters and then con
signed the letters to the waste basket, and
1 presume that went the way of nearly all
the rest. -'fy '"'â  , â¢
Q. To the best of your knowledge, then,
that letter is destroyed?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Do you remember its contents?
a. Pretty fully. ....
Q. Do you think you can state the sub
stance of Its contents?
A. I do.
Q. y.-.u may do so.
A. The letter was received soon after
mv "nomination for Assemblyman. It had
been reported already that I would make
no canvass whatever. I had been a Judge
in that section of the country for a pe
riod of some nineteen years, knew all the
people, all the people knew me; and knew
whether they wanted me or not for As
semblyman. " I decided that I would not
make the canvass. That, as I understand,
had come to the notice of Dan Cole,
who was my friend. He wrote to me in
substance this: "I think you ought to
make a canvass for the office. 1 know
there Is nothing in it for you and that you
cannot afford to make it on your own ac
count. Now, if you are in favor of Ulys
ses S. Grant for Senator you can have
whatever amount you require in order to .
make your canvass. Therearein the neigh- ]
borhood of fifty candidates for the Assem- i
bly on the Republican ticket who are
pledged (as I remember It)â who are
pledged to Grant, and he will probably be
elected."
Q. This is still the contents of the let
ter?
A. Yes. I am stating nothing else. And
that is the substance of the letter as I
remember it.
Q. By whom was the letter signed?
A. Dan T. Cole.
Q. From whence was it mailed?
A. From San Francisco.
Q. Does M. Cole live in San Francisco?
A. Yes, sir; he did at that timeâ well, I
do not know that he lived ln San Fran
cisco, but, as you are all aware, he li
the coiner of the Mint. I think he lives
in Oakland, but I have always addressed
him at San Francisco. But 1 wish to say
this more, Mr. Chairman, in order that
you shall understand . the matterâ that
Mr. Cole and myself have been acquainted
for some thirty-four years. The letter
was carelessly worded and I hadn't the
slightest idea in the world that Dan T.
Cole proposed to bribe me to vote for
U. .S. Grant, not the slightest in the
world. We would talk together as a
fathei and son would talk together, or
as brothers would talk together, and I
never thought of such a proposition as
Dan T. Cole proposing to bribe me.
Q. Why do you suggest that proposition
if you did not think that he would bribe
you.
A. Because I want you to understand
the situation; because I want -you to be
the judge of it.
Q. Has it been suggested to you that
the letter contained a bribe or an offer
to bribe?
A. Do I think it?
Q. Has it been suggested to you that
It did?
A. Oh, yes.
Q. And is that the reason that you now
speak of it?
A.- Yes; that is the reason why I sug
gest it to you, that you may know the
relations between us. I do not want to do
an injury to Dan T. Cole, and as you
gentlemen all know, I am not voting for
U. S. Grant.
Q. Did you respond to that letter?
A. I did, sir.
Q. By communication?
A. I did.
Q. You have not that letter, I suppose?
A. I have not.
Q. You do not know whether It is in ex
istence or not?
A. Mr. Cole states to me that it is not.
I wish it were.
Q. Do you remember the contents of
your reply?
A. I do.
Q. You may state them.
A. That Is, the substantial parts of that
reply.
y. The substance. We cannot expect
you to remember the words.
A. I cannot remember the words. And
perhaps the reply was not just, but I
stated to Mr. Cole that 1 did not think
there was any necessity for me to make, a
canvass for that district, inasmuch as
those people have known me for a period
of nineteen years on the bench; that If i
they did not want me to occupy that posi- !
tion I did not want it. The indications i
from his letter were that if 1 would sup- i
port Mr. Grant for United States Sena- '
tor I could have all the money I required |
in order to make my canvass. And in my
reply I said that I did not propose to
pledge my vote for canvass money; that !
if it became necessary to make that can- |
vass by a trip or a personal journey I j
would. make it on my own account. I
stated furthermore that if fifty men were
pledged to vote for U. 8. Grant I hoped
the last one of them would be defeated, |
for no man that would do a thing of that
kind was fit to be in the Legislature. Any j
more questions? y :.'/;/'
Q. Did you take the money that was j
offered? _ â¢
A. I did not sir. No specific sum was I
offered, and I took none. I gave $10 in !
that canvass, but I gave it to the Cen- j
tral Committee of the county, which has j
always been my practice, and no more, ;
and so stated In my affidavit when I was ,
elected to the Legislature.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Grant, Mr.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 22, 1899.
Green or anybody else acting "for them
put any money in your canvass, Judge?
A. I do not, sir. ' If anybody put any
money into my â¢ canvass at all I know
nothing of it. y.,;
Q. Did Mr. Cole in his communication
to you state whether he had the authority
to speak in that matter from Mr. Grant
or from Mr. Green. - '' :
A. He did not.' He did not state that he
had any authority from any source.
Q. Have you learned since that time, or
have you had any intimation since that
time, that he did have any authority, di
rect or indirect, from Mr. Grant or Mr.
Green to speak for them?
A. That is a wide question.
Q. Possibly so. -
A. I have not had any intimation from
any source- that he had authority to make
that, except such as has been indicated to
me from rumors here and there that the
same thing had been done by him or other
parties.
Q. That Is, by Cole?
A. Nothing else. That is only news
paper rumor, anyhow, and upon that I
don't depend much.
Mr. Mellickâ Judge Clough, in the testi
mony the other day of Milton Green, my
recollection is that he said that he
(Green) had given Dan Cole, I think he
said, a thousandâ something like a thou
sandâdollars to use or of Grant's money
to be used toward furthering his interests.
A. Given to me?
Q. No; had given it to Dan Cole.
A. Dan Cole? _, ,
Q. Yes. And now. then, did Dan Cole
or anybody else give you to understand
that this money that Cole was offering
to put In your campaign was Grants
money?
A. No, sir; not at all. Well, I will say
this; That when the money was offered
on such a condition as that the natural
presumntion would be that It was fur
nished TV the man that wanted the vote;
saying if I were in favor of a particular
man for that position that I could have
whatever money was needed in order to
make the campaignâ the natural infer
ence from that would be that the man
who wanted the vote of the Assemblyman
was the man who was putting up the
money. But that is a mere inference.
Q. Your hot answer was based on that
inference?
A. Oh, it was not a hot answer at all.
It was a straightforward answer, such
as any honest man ought to mako to a
proposition of that kind. It was not hot.
It was straightforward.
Q. But if the money had been oent to
you, you would have felt as though you
were being bribed, would you not?,
A. God! there was no chance of the
money being sent to me. I would have
felt, if I had accepted any money from
that source, that I had accepted a bribeâ
every dollar of It. What man could have
felt otherwise?
Q. Now, then, feeling that way, why do
you say that Dan Cole's offer to you was
not an improper one? J
A. Well, I do not say that it was not an
improper one. I only say this: That the
man has known me for a long period of
time, and he knew nothing of me to Indi
cate to him that I could take money un- .
der circumstances of that kind. It. may |
have been that he thought that I was in I
peril of my election, and he may have
been willing to furnish his own money, j
I do not know. It is a mere matter of in- ;
ference. Inferences are not for us to j
draw, but for this committee. I do not
draw any inferences. The man had known
me so well and our business relations
had been such that he could not have sup
posed that I would have accepted a' bribe.
It may be that he thought that we ought
to have a Republican Assembly, and that
he was willing to put up a little. money
of his own in order to help me; that may
be. That Is a matter of Inference that I
cannot draw as a witness.
Q. You did not take that view of It when
you wrote that letter, though.
A. No, sir, of course I did not. I was a
little hot and a little excited that such a
letter should come, but at the same time,'
upon mature consideration, I have felt
that the man could not have thought of
such a thing as bribing me. Ido not think
he could. But' my inference Is not to be
given. I have given you the substance of
the two letters as near as I can, and you
are to draw the inference and not myself.
Q. Did you get any other letters from
any other candidate along the same line-
Colonel Burns or anybody else?
A. I never received a letter from Col
onel Burns nor from any one connected
with him that I am aware of.
Q. In regard to his candidacy?
A. No, sir. I received a letter from Gen
eral Barnes, which I supposed was a cir
cular, and he spoke to me about his can
vass and that was all. I* answered It be
cause I had known the man for many
years, had respected him for many years,
and I received a letter from him in an
swer to that, but no consideration of any
kind from any candidate for' my vote in
any event. I received letters. I presume,
from all the prominent candidates before
the Legislature, such as one would ex
pect to receive. For instance, I received
letters from our honored Assemblyman,
Mr. Valentine, in reference to his candi
dacy for Speaker, and answered all those
letters, and all that I expended was $10,
which I delivered to the Central Commit
tee, and a two-cent stamp to answer each
one of these letters. I made lt a point to j
answer every one. Now, any more ques- i
tions, gentlemen?
Mr. Baconâ l would like to ask the gen
tleman a question when the committee is ,
through..
The chairmanâ Very well.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Grant never wrote you
a letter of any sort?
A. Mr. Grant wrote me a letter. . .
Q. What did he say in his letter?
A. Mr. Grant wrote me a letterâ merely j
a circular, I should judge. â¢
Q. The same as General Barnes? '
A. Yes, offering no reward for my vote, |
but simply stating that he would be
pleased to have my influence in his fa
vor If I felt that it should be given. Noth
ing more. ; * '_â¢â ' '--'
A. Did Mr. Green ever write you a ;
letter? â  â¢.;.
A. He did not. yo\yyyy,y
Q. Dan Cole never told you that Mr. j
Grant or Mr. Green authorized him to
write that letter? y ;â¢ y
, â  A. No, sir. 'â ! â .â â¢-;â â >-
Q. And they never told you that he did?
A. No, sir. On the contrary, after. Mr.
Cole had received my answer he was
somewhat offended ; at the answer, and
stated in substance that he was surprised
that I should suppose that he had intend
ed to offer me a bribe. That Is the second
letter from Mr. Cole. Any more ques
tions, gentlemen?
The chairmanâ lf there is nothing fur
ther to ask Judge Clough, we will excuse
him.
â¢ Judge Cloughâ Thank you.
Mr. Mellickâ l have prepared this com
munication: "Inasmuch as James: Cop
e! land, Esq.. is said by:C.E.. Washburn to
have offered an Assemblyman, presum
ably Dale, $3000 for his vote- I exoect to
prove ; the truth or falsity of Washburn's

BURNS WORKS ONLY
WHEN UNDER COVER
CALL . HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 21.â The forlorn hope of
bringing about a Republican Senatorial
caucus is the only thing Colonel Daniel
M. Burns is now holding out to his twen
ty-six supporters as a reason why he will
win the toga. The Burns touts have been
working all day to see If a caucus is not
a possibility, but they received no en-
couragement from any source other than
among the colonel's - own legislative fol
lowing. The Burns men are not circu
lating any petition for a caucus. They
know that such a paper at this time
would be absolutely devoid of any results
and that, furthermore, it would expose
their hand. Whatever the Burns people
do to assist the candidacy of the colonel
must be done under cover, for this rea
son: The moment the opposition forces
hear, of it they will ,be on their guard
and ready to oppose it.
The colonel, who is naturally secretive,
endeavors to cover all of his moves by
having them apparently come from his
enemies. In this matter of securing a
caucus the colonel Is having his touts
and those who are close to him sound
members of the Legislature on the propo
sition. If any encouragement is received
at all a petition will be placed in circula
tion Monday. If Colonel Burns waits until
he receives encouragement from Repub
lican members before he starts out to se
cure signatures to a caucus petition he
will still be waiting at the end of the
session if the sentiment continues' as it
is now.
The Grant people are the parties on
whom the Burns touts are directing their
special efforts in this caucus matter.
They seem to think that if they can get
the supporters of the San Diego man to
agree to hold one, then their sailing will
be clear.
A delegation of Burns' forces called at
Grant's headquarters to-day and dwelt
upon the fact that Mr. Grant was not
being benefited by the developments
made by the investigating committee, in
their judgment, and they regretted very
much that the facts thus far developed
might place him in an unfavorable light
before the people.
Colonel Burns' representatives went on
to say that the best way to close the
matter up was to put an end to the in
vestigation, obtain a satisfactory report
from the committee and put an end to
the whole matter.
They then went on to say that a Re
publican caucus would soon settle the
whole Senatorial squabble which was
threatening to disrupt the Republican
party, and insisted that a caucus was the
wise thing for all concerned. They as
serted that inasmuch as Mr. Grant had
twenty-eight votes, the highest number
that has been cast for any candidate, he
had no reason to fear a caucus, but on
the other hand they said that they were
inclined to think it might help Grant.
' The Grant managers, and more partic
ularly James Brown, were not to be
caught . by any such twaddle as this.
They brought the interview to an early
close with the statement that as far as
they were concerned they did not pro
pose to , advise any of their legislative
supporters to enter any Republican cau
cus to settle the Senatorshlp now or at
any future time.
The Barnes and the Bulla men are as
firm to-night as they ever were, and the
Burns followers are correspondingly glum.
Their caucus schemes have all come to
naught. Colonel Burns will remain over
until the next joint ballot of Monday. The
colonel stated to-night "he felt as fresh as
a daisy," and certainly looked It. The fight
which has been on for three weeks has
apparently not worn on him at all. He
directs every move his people make indi
vidually, but the strain has not affected
him -in. the slightest degree.

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 21.â Young Mr. Works of
San Diego, who is a good deal the same
sort of person as was the elder Mr. Works
of the same town, raised a good bit of a
shindy in the Assembly chamber this
morning by presuming to voice his own
and the general opinion of the investiga
tion committee just now engaged in the
mixing of whitewash.
"Mr. Speaker," quoth he in no meager
voice, "it is the opinion of the public and
of this Assembly that this investigation
Is not as effective as it should be, and I
want to introduce this resolution, that the

"In this way. Mr. Speaker, we can see,
officially, how matters stand and can de
cide whether to allow this committee to go
on or appoint a new one in its place."
If the younger Mr. Works had assaulted
legislative dignity with a well filled hor
net's nest he wouldn't have kicked up
more real, bright red joy.
"Who says we are not satisfied?" yelled
Mellick.
"Who say 8 so?" echoed Belshaw.
"Upon what authority do you base that
statement?" nicely inquired the ladylike
Mr. Johnson. --.-.:â¢
"Upon the authority of every Assem
blyman I've spoken ..with and nearly every
private individual whom I have heard ex
press an opinion," returned the doughty
southron, "and I ask that my resolution
be immediately read." It was.
Cold Foot Mellick couldn't stand for the
second demand. A report right now is
the last thing on earth Mr. Mellick wants
to dally with. It's a proposition Copper
shudders at. Dr. La Baree would rather
go back to his Weavervllle practice than
even think of it. Not a Bulla man on
the floor wants that Bulla-Burns com
mittee to be forced to a showdown, not
until the cards are stocked anyway, and
If this morning's uproar counts for any
thing it is evident the cards are not yet
stocked.
Mr. Valentine, also for Bulla and from
Los Angeles, shines as the simon pure
sample of the Pacific politician. He is
no fighter, but accomplishes more by pure
Intonation. A dulcet voice tuned to demi
tones is his stock in trade, and by mutual
consent he was selected to try it on with
Mr. Works' resolution.
"Mr. Speaker," quotha, "I sincerely
hope this resolution will not pass. It
seems to me we should place most im
plicit faith in our committee, show it that
we trust it to do the work laid down for
it. We must have faith. Of course, I do
not know what authority my young
friend from San Diego has for his state
ment. I hope none. None more than
mere idle rumor, anyway. I hope,. truly,
that this resolution shall not prevail."
Mr. Belshaw of Contra Costa, who
learned oratory with a hammer and anvil,
and apparently drew logic from a bellows,
followed the Los Angeles Valentine, and
he tripped with the fight right blithely.
He thought Mr. Works dallied with the
truth, and he said he knew the incentive
for his resolution, though he, with diffi
culty, refrained from saying what it was.
He saw no reason to doubt the commit
tee's honesty, and thought a report at
this time would only hamper them in
their intentions, of which rather remark
able statement no one got up to express
doubt.
Mr. Johnson got into the game by get
ting up to resign from his recent appoint
ment. He said Works did not want to go
as the commissioner because the Grant
people had met and decided that none of
them would serve.
Radeliff, the ruddy-locked beauty from
Santa Cruz, denied that the Grant folks
had dene any such thing. - y .'.â -*â 
Mr. Johnson got back by moving that
Radeliff and Cobb of San Francisco be
made committeemen, and Radeliff and
Cobb declined, though not before the San
ta Cruzan had had a bit of a row with
the Sacramentan and declared it would

ual covered (ir reached by the act Is re
quired to give a statement to the County
Assessor of his county before April 1 of

poration reached by the act to send In.

ing from parties or corporations who do

says: The recent sensational rise
In the value of > the stock of the
New York* Central Railroad , has been
accompanied by a number of rumors as to
changes and combinations ; which will
greatly enhance its value. The officials
of the New York Central have denied
that there is any. plan on foot to make a
substantial change in the property, but
people in Wall street insist that some
thing important is - under way, and cer
tainly those who have followed stock quo
tations and reason from them have good
ground to believe that something unusual
may he contemplated.
Within the last two weeks there have
been a series of most important confer
ences. William K. Vanderbllt, who con
ceived and executed the consolidation of
the Lake . Shore and New York Central,
has been a central figure in these confer
ences. He has called to consult with him
railroad men from all over the country.
Together with Cornelius, his brother, he
has been daily in close consultation with
operating officials as well as men who
control the stock of the Chicago and
Northwestern, the Union Pacific and the
Oregon Short. Line.
There is every reason to believe that a
gigantic combination Is proposed that will

THREATENED
TO SHOOT HIS
YOUNG WIFE
Lively Scene in the St.
Nicholas.
A RETIRED LAWYER'S WOES
THOMAS J. WELLS ABUSES HIS
BETTER HALF.
She Appeals to the Police, Who Suc
ceed in Effecting a Reconcilia- "
tions'âThe Woman's
Story. /
Considerable excitement was caused at
the St. Nicholas Hotel- last evening when
a well dressed woman ran along the hall
way lustily screaming for help. She was
stopped by one of the attaches of the
house, who asked her what had hap
pened. â¢ . ,y .
"My husband tried to shoot me," she
declared in excited tone; "we have been
married only a short time, and now he
wants, to get rid of me." ;
The woman was Mrs. Wells, the wife of
Thomas J. Wells, a retired lawyer, of Chi
cago. She was taken into the office of
the hotel, and as she momentarily feared
that her husband would shoot her she
begged that' the police be notified.
Patrolman Frank Smith, who happened
to be passing at the time, was Informed
of the woman's request, and he at once
entered the hotel. To him she said she
had been married to Wells only a short
time ago, in Chicago, and as he was anxi
ous for an extended honeymoon she sug
gested that they visit this city.
The couple arrived here a few weeks
ago and rented apartments at the Palace
Hotel. Last Wednesday Wells, who is
over 60 years of a^e, evidently tiring, of
the Palace, took rooms in the St. Nicho
las. Yesterday afternoon he telephoned
to the latter hotel for his wife, and as she
did hot answer the telephone he became
suspicious and went in search of her.
Not finding her at a friend's house,
where she was wont to visit, Wells re
paired to the hotel and demanded of the
clerk if he had; seen his wife. He In
formed the jealous husband that his bet
ter half had just returned and was in her
apartments.
Wells lost no time in finding out wheth
er the clerk was telling the truth or not,
and after meeting his wife he accused her
of being unfaithful to her marriage vows.
He then reached for his pistol and threat
ened to shoot her.
Fearing ho -would attempt to carry-his
threat into exeSktion Mrs. Wells, who is
only 23 years of^ge, ran from the room
and sought the protection, of the clerk.
Subsequently the woman visited police
headquarters and told her tale of woe to
Cafptain of Detectives Bohen. She de
clared that she feared Wells would shoot
her, and rather than sacrifice herself to
his insane jealousy she announced her de
termination to leave him.
Mrs. Wells claimed that her aged hus
band had -over $50,000 .in greenbacks, in
his possession. She feared' that if she left
him he would not > give her sufficient
money to reach her- home in Chicago. Â
She was advised to return to' the. hotel
and endeavor to "make up" with her hus
band. Inquiry at 'the: -hotel -last night
revealed the f act v that the couple bad
settled their differences, and that Wells
had promised not to shoot his, wife. *f:y
LOTZ WILL RETAIN
THE TREASURERSHIP
The Incumbent Gains in the Recount
for the Santa Clara County
Office.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 21.â recount of the
ballots in the contest for County Treas
urer was completed to-day, and Joseph
A. Lotz, the Republican, will retain the
office. E. W. Conant, the contestant,
played In hard luck. He was the nominee
of the Good. Government League, Demo
crats and Populists. Lotz was given the
certificate >of election on a plurality* of
two votes and Conant had every reason
to believe he could overcome it. He be
gan losing from the start, however, and
when the count was completed to-day
Lotz had. gained nearly a hundred. A
great many ballots were thrown out. of
which Conant had the majority. The
latter's defeat was due to the fact that
the reform forces did not understand
marking, ballots and the ballots rejected
on account of errors increased Lotz's lead.
The next contest to be heard will be
over the District Attorneyship. James H.
Campbell, who now holds the office, had
a plurality of 34. The ballots have been
closely watched during the Treasurer's
recount and B. -A. Herrington, the con
testant, claims he has gained 61 votes,
which gives him a plurality of 27. Camp
bell denies the claim and asserts the bal
lots show he has 60 more votes than were
recorded for him and that his lead of 39
cannot be overcome. .

NEED OF APPROPRIATION
FOR IRRIGATION PURPOSES
George H. Maxwell Working Hard
to Secure Favorable Action by
Congress.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.â George H.
Maxwell of California, who arrived here
a few days ago and is a representative
of the Irrigation Congress, is working
earnestly to get through an appropriation
of $50,000 by the j present session of Con
gress, which amount was recommended
by the Secretary of Agriculture for irri
gation investigations.
Mr. Maxwell says the importance of this
appropriation to California and the whole
arid west cannot be measured, and that
it would enable the Department of Agri
culture to carry on systematically a thor
ough investigation into all complex prob
lems in methods of distribution and utili
zation of water supplies and in applica
tion of water for irrigation which
confront the owner- of every â¢ ir
rigated farm and have brought dis
aster and ruin to so many, and would
result in the, speedy solution of many of
these problems. This appropriation was
cut down to $20,000 in the House and raised
to $25,000 in the Senate Committee on Ap
propriations, but the Senators from Cali
fornia and many of the Western Senators
are becoming actively interested in the
matter and it is hoped that the desired
amount may be obtained by having it in>,
serted in the bill when It comes up in the
Senate. However, consent of the confer
ence committee and of the House will also
have to be obtained in order to secure the
appropriation. , .'.

IN THE GUARD

Staff of the Governor
to Be Reduced.
OFFICERS' QUALIFICATIONS

IROM MANILA
Captain Turner Resumes Command
of the Naval â Arrang
ing for a Reception .' *
b \ <.',
The bill that has been prepared ln the
office of the major general, and which the
Legislature will be called upon to pass,
ls a voluminous document, which has
been prepared with a great deal of care,
so as to bring it up to the requirements
of the National Guard of the State of
California. In the preparation of this bill
the National Guard laws of the principal
States of the Union and the regular army
laws have been closely digested and the
best features that could be made applica
ble have been used as the basis for fram
ing some of the sections.
The bill provides for sixty-five compa
nies, fifty-six of which shall be cavalry,
artillery or infantry. There shall also be
a sanitary corps and a signal corps. The
staff of the Governor is to be materially
reduced. It is to connsist of an adjutant j
general, assistant general and ten aid-de
camps, four of which, below the rank of !
colonel, shall be appointed from tho !
guard including the naval militia, and
these shall not by reason of sfch position
on the staff be ielieved of the duties from ,
which they were taken except when actu
ally serving on the staff.
Petitions for the organizations are to
have on them the names of fifty signers,
instead of forty, as in the past.
In the past all who enlisted as guards
men were required to enlist as privates,
and were then assigned to certain posi
tions. Under the new bill men will have
an opportunity to enlist as musicians,
artificers and hospital stewards.
It provides that a man discharged by a
two-thirds vote or for the good of the
service may be re-enlisted with the consent
of the commander of the command to
which th*- man belonged, together with
the consent of the commander of the Na
tional Guard.
If a man is discharged for physical dis
ability and should in time recover so as ;
to again be able to join the guard he may
do co and be allowed credit for the time
that he served prior to his discharge.
After a man has served out his first
term of enlistment he may re-enllst again
and again, but he cannot re-enlist if he
has attained the age of 45 without the con
sent of the commander of the brigade.
No man will be allowed an honoraole
discharge who has not during the period
of his enlistment performed 60 per cent of â 
military duty, but will receive a simple
discharge; but he may continue in the
service until he has made up the defi- j
ciency and in that manner receive un '
honorable discharge.
The National Guard shall be armed and
equipped as is the army and navy of the
United States.
Provision is made for the staffs of the
major general, the brigadiers and other*
officers of lower grade. . There is consid
erable change in these and all aids will
rank as sergeant major, and each will be
of the cavalry branch of the service.
It provides that no one shall be com
missioned who has not had military ex
perience either in the regular army c r
navy, the volunteer service or the Na
tional Guardâ this to prevent the granting
of commissions to men from civil life who :
have never seen service.
Elected officers are to hold their com
missions for four instead of two years.
Officers may be brevet ted for gallantry
or meritorious service under certain con- I
ditions.
Provision is made for the equitable
treatment of men and officers who may
by reason of the dropping of a company
or other reasons be mustered out of the
guard. In the case of the officers then
is to be a supernumerary list, on which
shall be placed the names of officers so
mustered out of the service. From thlÂ«
list officers may be taken and assigned to
special duty. , They are to So on this list
with the rank held at the time of mus
tering out. but if assigned to a higher po
sition they will be recognized by the
higher title, but on being returned to the
supernumerary list they will resume th<>
title held at the time they were placed
The bill provides for the retirement , _
officers as Is done In the regular array
._ Th< . 4 ttorn, ; > ' General is substitute! for
the judge advocate on the staff of the
Governor.
There is provision for the mustering of
the troops at stated periods, and for the
mustering of the same at other times it
necessary.
The cavalry is to consist of not less than
four troops, distributed as.-the needs of
the State shall demand. These are to be
organized as a battalion under command
of a major. yy
The signal corps is to be organized as
a battalion of three companies, distiibuted
where necessary.
The sanitary "corps is to be a separate
organization. â¢ â ' -=--. . .â¢^â¢.. â¢:-â 
When doing military duty the National
Guard shall have the right of way after
the mail, fire department and police.
There is a provision that will prevent
the Salvation Army and kindred.organiza
tions. in fact, any body not a recognized
military one, from wearing any insignia
worn by officers and men of the guard.
Another provision is that no liquors
shall be sold within certain limits of any
military camp.
William J. Stock, who as a member of
the Second Brigade Signal Corps, in com
pany with, four others of the same corps,
enlisted in the United States Volunteer

Don't Want the Philippines.
At its meeting Friday night the Labor
Council put Itself on record as opposed to
.the annexation of the Philippine Islands.
The- resolutions introduced begin by de
claring that the late war was for the pur
pose of freeing Cuba from Spanish rule,
and that the Philippine question was
forced upon the country as a result of
this war. The resolutions were adopted
after a hot debate. -.'
At the request of Phil Davis of the
Cigar-makers' Union the council de

A BIG BOULEVARD â
FOR THE NORTH END
PROJECT TO CONNECT PRESIDIO
AND CITY FRONT.
To Pave Montgomery Avenue and
"Widen Washington Streetâ
Land-Owners to Stand
the Cost.
"When the projectors of the Improvement I
of the northeastern part of this city start
ed the movement a week or so ago they
did not expect as much interest to be
taken as has- been shown, nor did they
realize the extent to which the progres
sive step might lead. The project as out
lined by Henry Sonntag and a few others
was that the property in the section lying
east of Kearny street and north of Cali
fornia could be improved so that business
men would establish wholesale houses
there. To effect this, streets, sewers and
sidewalks would have to be put in good
condition and modern buildings erected.
It was thought that the increase of ship- !
ping, arising from the new island posses- |
sions of Uncle Sam, would warrant the
reviving of the wholesale district.
. Within the past two days another im- j
provement has been projectedâ the con- j
version of Montgomery avenue and Wash
ington street Into a boulevard. The organ- |
izing committee of the new association, !
consisting of George X. Fitch. W. A. Keyes, j
W. H. Howard. Joseph Brandenstein and !
Colonel cnadbourne, met yesterday, and j
representatives of many large land own
ers called and signified their desire to co
operate with the movement. Among them |
was Supervisor Holland, who urged that ;
the matter of making a boulevard from ,
the Presidio to the water front along
Montgomery .' avenue and Washington
street be considered. His. suggestion was j
that the movement be a purely private ;
affair, the land owners of the thorough- !
fares named being the only ones inter- j
ested. In the first place the avenue should j
be laid with a modern bitumen pavement. \
order to have the lower end of the (
boulevard wide enough, twenty-five feet
should be taken off the private lands and
added to what is now, Washington street.
This would make It 105 feet wide, And as
all of the holdings are now at least 100
feet deep there would still be plenty of |
room for the erection of. fine buildings.
This proposition was made to half a â 
dozen of the wealthier property owners, I
and so far as could be learned not one !
looked upon the suggestion unfavorably. |
A number volunteered to give freely the i
required twenty-five feet and to begin the j
work of putting up modern buildings as
soon as the boulevard is an established j
fact- From the Intersection of Montgom- (
cry avenue there are five blocks to the j
water front, and it was decided that the i
cut would naturally come off the south !
side of the street. Mr. Sonntag. in speak- ]
ing of the idea, stated that nothing could
be devised that would he of so much bene- i
fit to the northern end of the city as a i
wide, modern thoroughfare, as people al- I
ways prefer to do business on wide, well
kept streets and they always avoid nar
row, stuffy alleys. So enthusiastically
did the land owners take to the scheme ;
that members of the committee started ;
out at once to get the movement on foot. j
Mission Club Reorganized.
A revival of the Mission Improvement
Club was effected last night by a meeting
of the members of the executive commit
tee, at which were present: Judge F. VST.
Van Reynegom, George Walcom, D.
Kelly, George L. Center, D. A. Hulse, A.
B. Maguire, John A. Lennon, John Mc-
Mullin. J. H. Grady, J. H. Simpson, Wil
liam Metzner, John D. Daly, A. P. Van
Duzer and J. C; Young. The object of the
club is to protest against the closing of
the Mission High School, to advocate the
extension of the panhandle, the acquiring
of the two blocks in front of the high
school for a public park and other mat
ters.
Reduced "Wine Rates.
The reduction in wine freight rates,
as announced by the Southern Pacific,
\ from shipping points in this State to New
' York and New Orleans, via Sunset
j Route, is from 60 cents to 45 cents
per 100 pounds. This rate, of course, is
' for wine in wood. In November the
Southern Pacific advanced its rate 6 cents
! per gallon, which is the same as 60 cents
; per 100 pounds. The present reduced rate
1 is about 4% cents a gallon. The railroad
j was forced to make lower rates, as the
! steamships were charging only 3V_ cents
j per gallon, and were beginning to carry
: enormous cargoes.
Whist Tournament.
The sixth semi-monthly meeting of the
O'Sae "Whist Club was held last Wednes
day evening' at 626 Shotwell street. Miss
Lulu Bert was the hostess of the evening.
The playing was spirited and close, there
being three contestants for the llrst prize,
which was decided by lots. The three
first players of the evening were: Clar
ence Naumar, Charlotte Hause and Bert
W. Bernhart. After supper there was
dancing, and the festivity of the occasion
was kept up until a late hour.
j CRUELTY TO A HORSE.
Employe of a Contracting Company
Arrested at San Rafael.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 21.â Deputy Frank
Trafnor of the Marin County Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ar
rested Alexander McDonald, an employe
of the Buckman Contracting Company,
for a flagrant case of cruelty in the treat
ment of a diseased horse to-day. Mc-
Donald tried to excuse himself on the
? round that he was acting under orders
rom a superior., but was told that the
law made provisions excepting nobody.
A large force under Foreman Sherwood
has lately been at work on the new
sewer system. Several persons hay*
made complaint that a horse that seemed
almost unable to stand was being worked.
An investigation showed that. the animal
was covered with- sores and was badly
lamed in the left leg. McDonald, the
driver, was arrested and pleaded that
Sherwood had ordered the horse worked.
His case will come up before Recorder
Gardner next Monday. yyyy-
Disinherits His Son.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 21.â Timothy Day,
a pioneer of this city, who is now lying
at death's door with pneumonia, deeded
all his property, valued' at about $5000, to
his son Thomas and daughter Annie to
day. Another son named Henry, now In
Honolulu, was not permitted to figure in
the distribution of the property, it Is al
leged, on account of going, contrary to
his father's wishes, in a love affair.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.

THE EXPOSITION COMMITTEE
AS reorganized the exposition committee now
forms a truly representative body. To the
number of members originally appointed by
the Mayor there have been added three delegates from
each of twenty-three commercial, industrial or finan
cial organizations in the city; the chairmen of the
various improvement clubs.- which have done so much
for the public good; the State officers; the chair
men of the county Boards of Supervisors; the regents
of the university, and an auxiliary committee of ten
ladies. ' ' -â¢-
The merit of a committee thus selected is that every
man in it has proven his public spirit by taking part
in the work of some organization or association en
gaged.in enterprises designed to advance the general
welfare. It is not made up of that class of prominent
citizens who are so careful of their dignity or their
case that they never share the worry, the strife and the
labor of righting and working for some public under
taking. All of them have had experience of the an
tagonisms and the wranglings that accompany every
movement that disturbs silurianism and stagnation,
and none of them are likely to be discouraged by
obstacles or difficulties that may arise in the path of
the great project upon which the city has now en
tered.
With a committee so trained in the work of dealing
with men and conducting public affairs we can rea
sonably expect the accomplishment of a genuine tri
umph in the way of an exposition. The officials of
neither the city* the counties or the State can have
just cause for hesitation in co-operating with such a
body. Therefore, when the committee meets and fully
organizes the actual work of the exposition may be
said to have begun, It is now time for the whole
State to give support to the enterprise, for as soon as
it is seen that California is in earnest in the matter
other States will hasten to assist in the project that
they may share in its benefits.
THE RIVER AND HARBOR BILL.
DESPITE the earnest desire of the Republican
majority in Congress to balance the expenses
of the war by the practice of strict economy,
appropriations fairly liberal in their nature have been
made in the river and harbor bill just reported to the
House. This is what was to have been expected, for
the Republican party is the champion of internal im
provements, and its representatives in Congress well
understand that there can be no better economy on
the part of the Government than wisely directed ef
forts toward the accomplishment of such improve
ments.
In the bill as reported from the committee the ap
propriations for California include: San Diego har
bor, $50,000; San Luis Obispo harbor, $50,000; San
Francisco harbor, removing Arch and Shag rocks,
$100,000, and continuing, contract, $538,620; Sacra
mento River below city, $30,000, and continuing con
tract, $184,000.
These items are not only less than we desire, -but
are considerably below what the importance of the
river and harbor work in the State deserves and re
quires. Still, when it is borne in mind that the total
new appropriations carried in the bill amount to but
little over $12,500,000. and that the continuing con
tracts authorized aggregate but $16,791,000, it will be
seen that we fare about as well as the other portions
of the Union. by
The river and harbor work in California is, how
ever, something which the National Government
should soon undertake on a large and comprehensive
scale. To that end our representatives in Congress
ought to direct their main efforts and work with cor
dial co-operation. We have never received from the
Government anything like the assistance, which has
been bestowed on other. States, the extent of whose
rivers and coastline is far 'short of that of the rivers
and coast of California. ' .
Now that the Republican party is safely intrenched
in power it is certain that all well considered projects'
for internal improvements will be favorably regarded
nt Washington. By the protection granted to our
industries the. party has shown its willingness to do
all' that legislation can to promote the i welfare of
the State. If, therefore, we make as earnest a contest
for rivers and harbors as we made for protection to
our industries, we will undoubtedly obtain great as
sistance from tlje Government. Hitherto we have been
negligent in urging our claims at Washington. Now
that we have a strong Republican delegation there
we should profit' by the opportunity and be as vigi
lant in the future as we have been neglectful in the
past.
* Spain has much less trouble in settling the peace
propositions than we have. To the victors belong the
hair-pulling over the spoils.
THE ADMINISTRATION POLICY.
IT has been inferred to be the purpose of the Presi
dent to retain the Philippines and assert our
1 sovereignty fiicrc by conquest, if the assent of the
Filipinos cannot be had peacefully. This inference
arose in some expressions made by the President dur
ing his recent tour in the South. - ~ -b
The first indication that it was not warrantable was
in the speech by Senator Forakcr. Though Foraker
is not exactly a thick and thin supporter of.the^adj
ministration/and added his voice ; and : influence to the
scheme of forcing the President's* hand in the Spanish?
war. yet there is no ground for the belief that he
would now seek to embarrass the administration in a?'
proper settlement of the various and vexatious issues
left by that. war. Since he and Senator, v Mason
delivered their very conservative speeches other signs
have appeared that the President was taken to in
tend more than he meant in the oratorical expression^
which seemed to the country to be a statement of his
policy. â¢ , â¢'.. , b .
The Chicago Times-Herald, which is perhaps more
pronounced in its character as an organ of the Pres.-.
dential purpose than any other paper in the Union, in
a recent carefully phrased editorial, chides Senators
Hoar and Hale for fighting a policy that no one in
tends to adopt. It says in terms that the administra
tion has never intended the permanent occupation of
the Philippines, and that to fight such a policy is to
offer battle to windmills. f â  '-.
If this be so, it might well be announced in some
other form than fault-finding with Senator Hoar and
those who stand with him. The people have done
homage to the supposed wish of the' President, and
by far the greatest support obtained by the ; imperial
ists has come from the popular confidence in the ad
ministration and a desire to express it. The people
are not supposed to be able to devote the time and
research necessary to grasp the whole question, and
have been willing to trust and accept the conclusions
of the President. â¢
Europe may be included in the Times-Herald's criti
cism of Senators Hoar and Hale. every foreign
capital jitl has been understood to be the President's
purpose to hold the Philippines. That this was es
pecially the understanding in London was shown- by.
the surprise expressed there at the tone of Foraker's
speech. . / '.- :Â»
â  It is the general European understanding that if we
refrain in the case of the Philippines we indicate a
purpose to avoid an invasion of Old World interna
tional politics. If we hold the Philippines, such in
vasion inevitably goes with that policy.
Last week Representative Berry of .Kentucky, while
discussing the naval appropriation, took occasion to
indicate our power and purpose to whip Germany as
we have Spain. Such fool talk has heretofore been
common in Congress, and Europe has understood
that it was merely to impress gaping and gullible con
stituents in Podunk or Bowling Green. We were
not in European politics, and a Congressman's talk
of that sort excited no more attention there than in
the moon. But this time.it was different. The ex
pectation that by holding the Philippines we meet
the other robber nations in the East, to cut and hack
and parcel out countries regardless of the wish of
their inhabitants, made Mr. Berry's bloviation an im
portant matter. It assumed the same standing as the
recent remarks Of the British Embassador to Paris,
find Germany very properly wanted to know what a
meant.-, ,â  ; â¢ ... ',',*;- .'-â ---:--,â¢ .-, rr , .* ;
It is idle, therefore, to attack Senators Hoar atid
Hale for assuming what the rest of the world has be
lieved to be true.,
The Berry incident is useful as a foretaste of what
will happen if we enter upon an imperial and military
policy, and brings into plain relief the inadaptation of
our form of government to such a policy; Heretofore
the diplomacy needed in the maintenance of our rela
tions with the rest of the world has been in the hands
of the executive and has proceeded quite successfully,
independent of the talk in Congress. The settlement
of the Oregon boundary with Great Britain is an il
lustration. While Senator Ned Hahnegan was, shout
ing, "Fifty-four forty or fight," and Allen of Ohio
and others were breathing slaughter and reprisal in
his support, Polk was quietly making a treaty with
Great Britain relinquishing the parallel of fifty-four
degrees and forty minutes north latitude as our north
ern boundary, and his diplomacy settled the issue
without any fight. '
If we are to change our position and put a finger in
the pie of other countries we must change our system
of government, for then every word and act in Con
gress will have the import of a diplomatic expression,
and the country will never see peace until padlocks
are put on the mouths of Congressmen., *' b,
FIGHTING THE DESERT. b
IN the current number pf the. London National Re
view there is a brief but interesting account of
some- of the salient features of the character of
James Tyson, the Australian millionaire, who died at
Sydney last December. It is a story which merits at
tention, .for it reveals not only the source of the
pleasure such men have in their life work, but the
usefulness of that work to the world.. Vy : ;
Tyson Was an extraordinary man. He passed his
youth in poverty, having no advantages of education,
and it was not until he was over 30 years of age
that he began to succeed in life. -He laid the founda
tions of his fortune by supplying meat to the newly
opened Bendigo gold district, and fl then.-.' purchased
cattle and cattle ranges on a large scale. At the time
of his death. he owned half a * million acres, leased
many thousand square miles, and left a fortune esti
mated at $25,000,000. ' â¢;.;,.' < '. .â â â 
The greater portion of his wealth was earned by
reclaiming desert lands and making them productive
by irrigation. He lived the life of a frontier cattle
man up to the time of his death, and in his later years
frequently boasted ..he had never entered a church,
a theater or a public house; that he had never tasted
beer, wine or spirits; that- he had never sworn, had
never used- soap nor worn a white shirt or a glove.
When asked what enjoyment he got out of*' his
wealth in that sort of life he answered: "Money
docs not interest me. The money is nothing. It was
the little game that was fun." In reply to an
inquiry, what the "little game" was he said: "Fight
ing the desert. That has-been my work. ,1 have been
fighting the desert all my life and I have won. I have'
put water where there was no water and beef where
there was no" beef. I have put fences where' there
were no fences and roads where there were ho roads.
Nothing can undo what I have done, and millions
will be happier for it after I am long, dead and for
gotten." *".'-.
.There are not many millionaires who live as Tyson
lived, t in rough abstemiousness, after acquiring vast
wealth, and it is not desirable .they should, for
wealth ought to be used for the advancement of art
and -culture as well as the" improvement of barren
lands and the increase of beef; .but there arc many
who.- like him; have found the chief enjoyment of life
not in the possession of money,. but in the little game
they" have played against adverse circumstances arid

achieved fortune by fighting the deserts, the wilder
nesses, the mountains, the swamps and all regions in

have made roads where there were no roads and
that millions will be happier for what they have .done.
Wealth - acquired in that way is an increase of wealth

lations or the organization of trusts to crowd out
weaker competitors, are public benefactors in the

POLITICAL IMBECILITY.
"~ IT \ HE,. discerning; reader. cannot have failed to ob-
THE discerning reader cannot failed to ob
serve amid the disgraceful scandal which has
}. *' overtaken the Legislature at -the outset of its
'.career remarkable evidences of imbecility among the
politicians who have been managing the "fights" of
some of the Senatorial candidates. If this feeble
mindedness were not connected with a solemn sub
ject we might make a great deal of. fun over it; but
humorous sallies in connection with a matter of so
much importance, not only, in California, but to the
nation, cannot be considered for one moment.
When Speaker Wright and Mr. Green, Grant's man
ager, assume that the public will believe for a single
moment that the $1650 paid by the latter to the former
was a business transaction pure and simple they are
taking liberties with the credulity of the people wliich
are simply astounding.
: The fact, however, that. each. of them has testified
that there was no understanding by which the money
Was" to exercise a' corrupt" influence on Speaker
Wright, and the additional fact that the Speaker ex
pects that the contrary was understood, is so broadly
humorous that one can scarcely be censured for re
garding it with some levity. If there is a yellow dog
in the State of California which will believe that
Wright borrowed this money with the intention of re
paying it, or that he regarded it as a business transac
tion which in no way could influence his future offi
cial action, he ought to be brought forth and made an
example of at once. Such a dog would disgrace his
species, besides being entitled to the designation of
the greatest fool thing that God,* in his inscrutable
wisdom, has ever created.
There is no other theory in connection with this
matter which is feasible except the one that both
Wright and Green regard; the- people of California as
a pack of idiots. The fact that they have put forth
this fool explanation of their transactions indicates not
only this, but the further fact that they are a couple
of idiots themselves. "â¢
Every man, woman and child in the State of Cali
fornia knows that Green paid Wright $1650 for the
purpose of securing his vote for Grant. In view of
the evidence which has 'been, introduced every man*
woman and child in the State knows that Wright de
clined to stay bought because he had made a more
profitable arrangement with the managers of another
candidate. -No amount of sophistry 'will ' ever ob
scure these inferences." " -:"; ;.v '.'<;",*. t
Perhaps neither of these men can^be sent to the
penitentiary, but that both them deserve to be sent
there is beyond question.
SLOT MACHINE SAVINGS BfINK.
1 ;ROM the London Chronicle we learn 'there has
J been started that city the novel enterprise of a
been started in that city the novel enterprise of a
savings bank designed to carry on its business
largely through the mechanism of the penny-in-the
slot machines, which have become so notable a fea
ture of our civilization. 'â¢â¢>'"Â»
The president of the proposed bank in an inter
view with the Chronicle explained that upon a person
placing a penny into a slot he would receive a card in
return which he would hold as a voucher for his de
posit. At any time the person could take or send I
these vouchers to the bank and be credited with the
amount in the books of the bank, while they under
took to repay the amount of the voucher within a rea
sonable time after deposit. Any attempt at fraud will
be speedily detected, the mechanism of the automatic
boxes rendering it impossible of fulfillment. As the
pennies are received into a box they will fall into a
tube with a- "thermometer-like" register, the number
at the side corresponding with the ticket that, is issued
to. the investor. In cases of metal disks being inserted j
and vouchers obtained these will be disallowed when |
an investor has his account made. up. In no case will
a voucher be redeemable within a week, in order that
the bank authorities may be able to assure themselves
that there; has been no fraud. '
The scheme is so ingenious and so simple it ought
to have been devised by a Yankee rather than a Brit
isher! _ :It will be a great saving not only of pennies
but of time. One will not have to go to the bank to
deposit his -nickel. He can drop it into a slot and get
.his check at any street corner. â People will be, able
"to save their pennies so easily no one will feel inclined
to risk them on a cigar raffle or drop them in the hat
cf a beggar. ' It is a case of thrift made easy, con
venient and always handy. "-'.'.
b Of course such a scheme requires the highest con
fidence in the men who run the bank and also in the
Government that watches them and protects the de
positor.' That confidence. being assured^ the' scheme
is undoubtedly a good one. and all that is lacking to
make it perfect is some machine in which a man can
drop his check and get his money. , by -
A If Speaker Wright bis. not turned down from his
cffficc he will be a regent of the' State University for
two years to come, and we may yet hear of him trying
to, work a scheme to get Dan Burns elected to the
presidency of the institution.

TO BE MADE
RULER IN A
GREAT CHURCH
Rector of St. Luke's
to Be a Bishop.
AN ECCLESIASTICAL PAGEANT
GREAT GATHERING OF PACIFIC
COAST PRELATES.
"J
The First Consecration to the Epis
copate Ever Held in the Far
- â Sacramento to iff
> Have a Bishop.
The consecration of Rev. W. H. More
land, rector of, St.* Luke's Church, to the
bishopric of the missionary diocese of
Sacramento is absorbing the attention of
Episcopalians of the State to the exclu
sion of all other subjects of church inter
est. It will be a historical event, Inas
much as it is the first consecration of a
Bishop on the Pacific Coast, and Is re
garded as an indication of the increasing
strength of the .denomination, Wednes
day, in the church calendar, is the feast
of the conversion of the Missionary Apos
tle St. Paul, and on that account this an
niversary was designated for the great
occasion. .
When Bishop Kip came to these shores,
half a century ago, he was the sole repre
sentative of the American episcopate
West of the. Missouri River. Now on the
.western slope of the Rocky Mountains
there are no less than twelve Bishops and
many thousands of adherents, comprising
the most wealthy and' prosperous of- the
community.. In California alone there are
now three Bishops, with a not distant
prospect of another; and to fill the place
of the late eloquent Dr. . Wingfield, a
Bishop is to be consecrated on Wednesday
next. â ' â â  " " .. " .yy
, At the late general convention of the
church the name of the diocese of North
ern California was changed to that of
Sacramento; following a custom, of an
cient times of naming the see of a Bishop
after the chief city. The consecration of
the rector of St.. Luke's as Bishop of an
important and growing missionary dis
trict will be attended, by all the dignity
and impressiveness that can be imparted
to a great ecclesiastical pageant.
It is a matter of much regret that the
theater of the consecration is so inade
quate. St. Luke's at the utmost can ac
commodate not over 800 persons, besides
the 100 clergymen, Bishops and other par
ticipants in the ceremony. ; The vestry of
Trinity Church courteously tendered the
use of that splendid edifice, but the offer
was declined, the people of St. Luke's
believing that the advancement of their
talented and beloved rector should. take
place in their own church and nowhere

There will be. seven Bishops ' present,
Including the Lord Bishop of Columbia,
the Bishops of Olympia, Spokane, Los
Angeles, "Utah. and Nevada, Arizona and
the Bishop of California. The aged
Bishop of Oregon" and the Bishop, of
Alaska also were expected, but cannot

V The Bishops of California,- by appoint
ment of the presiding Bishop of. the
church, will' act as c'onsecrator. Bishop
Barker of Olympia, who has a wide rep
utation for eloquence, will be the preach
er. The presenters will be the Bishops of
Los Angeles and Utah. The new Bishop
of the Greek church has been invited to
grace the occasion and is expected to at
tend. The attending- clergymen to the
Bishop-elect will be the Rev. E. J. Lion
of St. Stephen's, and Rev. W. C. Shaw,
assistant of St. Luke's. Representing the
Sacramento diocese there will be Revs. C.

of Petaluma. Rev. R. C. Foute of, Grace
Church will act as master of ceremonies.
The services of the day will begin with
an early celebration of the holy Euchar
ist, which will be open to all without tick
ets, but the great ceremony of the day
will begin at 11 o'clock. For this service
only those fortunate -enough to have tick
ets of invitation will be admitted. At the
service the communion office only will be
said, those, communicating .who are ac
tive participants in the ceremony.-
The musical feature of the service will
be under the competent direction of, Mr.
Sabin-, organist of the church. Owing to the
necessity of economizing space, only about
twenty, musicians will be in the choir.
No special efforts for an elaborate- musical
service will be made. Tours in F will be
sung, and the hymns 490, .586, 253 and 521
will be rendered. congregationally during
,the consecration. The anthem will be
Mendelssohn's "How Lovely are the Mes
sengers," preceded by the duet, "Now
Are We Ambassadors.'.'^. â¢ ,
The demand for seats ls so great that
If, the church was five- times as 'large as
it is the accommodations would have
been seriously taxed. The congregation
of St. Luke's nave been allotted only a
limited number of tickets and the differ
ent parishes of the city and vicinity are
only partially supplied. A large number
of the clergy and *aity of the Sacramento
diocese, desired to be present, but only
a limited number could be given tickets,
while â¢ the clergy and delegates to the
convention had also to be considered. One
hundred seats will be crowded into the
chancel space for the officiating clergy
and the choir.- â¢ -
The Bishops, clergy and choir will robe
at 1812 Van Ness avenue and are requested
to appear at this address not later than

CIGAR-MAKERS
ARE ; WRONGED
.'". .â '.'.', SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 20, 1599. .
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: Please
accept my gratitude in the name of the
thousands of small-cigar- manufacturers
of- the United States for the proper-stand
you have taken in your valuable paper
of the 19th inst. against, the decision of
Commissioner of Internal Revenue 'in re
gard '.to the new rule of the war revenue
act, I which prohibits tobacco dealers from
selling in broken packages or small quan
tities of tobacco to small cigar manufac
turers, which means to drive the small
cigar manufacturer out of his business,
because he Is not able to buy large quan
tities of. tobacco, and thug deprive thou
sands' of families of their daily bread and
drive them by force into poverty, and
in favor of the rich.. ' ffyf
Dear' Mr.' Editor,- I* am also greatly
pleased over your 'kind advice, that this
issue is one which- cannot be postponed,
an.d that Congress "at the present session
should be impressed upon to repeal such
despotic-rules.
y -Here is another law which ought to be
abolished, by which great injustice is
done to the small manufacturers, and
that is the, war revenue license, by which
the rich manufacturer who turns out mil
lions of cigars annually pays only for his
800,000 cigars $25 war revenue, and for the
millions nothing, while the small cigar
manufacturer if he sells only 12,000 or over
annually has to pay $6 license. The proper
classification ought to be to pay 1 cent
a thousand cigars, rich or poor alike, so I
would- have to pay on my part about 10 or
12 cents at the rate of 1 cent a thousand
cigars. Unjust classification is nothing
else but robbery. :â ; ...... - â â¢â  â 
Here we have another case where the
wealthy are favored in the revenue stamp
charges, because there Is no proper classi
fication. If a man makes â  1000 cigars of
the finest grade which sells for $125 a
thousand he pays only $3 CO revenue; the
man that makes 1000 cigars that sell for
$10 or $12 per thousand pays $3 60. Why
not have the cigars classified in four
classes: Class 1, $125 a/thousand, say
$6 revenue; Class 2, between $50 and $100 a
thousand, say $5 revenue- Class 3. be
tween $25 and $50 a thousand, say $3,reve
nue; Class 4, between $10 and $23 a thou
sand, say $1 50.
That would be fair and square. As the
most profit is derived , from the best
grades why should not the Government'
get its full share and give to the poor and
rich a. like benefit. -
â¢.-.Congress ought to. revise all these laws
and see that justice is done, to everybody?
and .that injustice be blotted out. Finally,
! would only wish that every citizen in
the land Would read The Call, including,
of course. Congressmen and the Revenue
Commissioner. - A. LEWKOWITZ,

./ y
The Colors of Marcus Daly Carried to
the Front by Ella Boland in
the Two-Year-Old
, Event.
The warm, balmy weather seemed to
awaken renewed interest in racing, for
the largest crowd of the meeting wit
nessed the finishes at Ingleside yesterday.
The fields were very evenly classed and
the different events well contested. Fa
vorites Just managed to hold their own
by capturing three purses.
The Lakeside stake, over a mile and a
half, decided under selling conditions, did
not attract a heavy field to the post, but
three lining up. The Corrigan entry, Sar
donic, carrying "Skeets" Martin and 100
pounds, was the favored one in the bet
ting. Lady Hurst, with Bullman up, did
not lack for friends, and Rainier was ac
corded scattering support. It was a two
horse race, â¦tinier, the lightweight, early
having enough. Lady Hurst led the favor
ite when headed for the wire the second
time, but near the furlong pole was
passed. When it looked very rosy for
Sardonic she faltered opposite the pad
dock and Lady Hurst won out In clever
fashion. Bullman received a mild ova
tion for his handling of the winner.
The copper and green colors of Marcus
Daly were seen for the first time on the
California turf in the two-year-old scram
ble. â¢ Ella Boland, a daughter of Sam Lu
cas, was entered in the millionaire's name
and the northern filly proved quite a
saucy racing morsel. The ring laid 10 to 1
about her. and with Thorpe in the saddle
she skipped off the three furlongs in :36V_,
winning with ease from Kitty Kelly. The
favorite. Loch Katrine, was third.
The steeplechase, decided over the short
course, was an exciting affairâ that is, so
far as Silverado and Colonel Bartlett,
first and second choices, respectively,
were concerned. ..Hennessy piloted Silver
ado and outjockeylng T. Murphy, on the
Corrigan entry, won in a driving finish
by half a length. Huntsman, after a fash
lon, finally took the show honors.
The mile handicap demonstrated what
a really good horse Bendoran is. Allotted
IIS pounds, he started an even money
choice, and won easing up from Moringa.
Morelllto was third, over a length in front
of David Tenny. Horton was a starter,,
but after chasing the winner for nearly
six furlongs, found the pace too hot.
The opening six furlong sprint saw the
even money favorite, Opponent, ridden
by Spencer, go down to defeat. Closing
strong the last part, he could not quite
get up, and was beaten a nose by Hora
tio, which horse made the running all the
way. The winner was ridden with excel
lent judgment by Bullman.
Further down the card Milt Young, the
Corrigan entry, managed to win the mile
! and a sixteenth run from a cheap crowd
!of platers. A 3 to 5 favorite, it took hard
j riding on Martin's part to get him over
I the line a length ln advance of Ulm.
Track Notes.
Burns, the rider of Lord Chesterfield,
was indefinitely suspended by the judges.'
When the field was dispatched by Starter
Caldwell It looked as if Burns made no
effort to get his mount in motion.

old dash. Is trained by. the veteran, Dan

BASEBALL FLOURISHES AT
STANFORD UNIVERSITY
The baseball players of Stanford Uni
versity are determined to regain the
laurels they have lost, and with that ob-
ject in view hard practice on the diamond
is proposed. The following correspond
ence is self-explanatory:
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 21. 1899.
It is In baseball this year that Stanrord ex
pects to wipe out to some extent the defeat of
.Thanksgiving day. Captain Beckett and Man
ager i._,nagan have instituted the practice ot
getting the players out for early exercise, so
that tne preliminary work on the team shall
consume us little time as possible when the
season really begins. Most of the old men
who succeeded in winning for the cardinal last
year's series with Berkeley have returned to
college. Strohn is both as steady and brilliant
as ever.' : With him behind the bat and Cap-
tain Beckett in the box Staniord is sure of a I
creditable battery, ln case Strohn Is needed j
to guard third Swindells will probably catch, i
"Home-run" Young, who remained away last !
semester, will return to college next week. !
His ability to line out long and safe hits will !
greatly strengthen the batting of the team.
The season will start out with Beckett and
Swindells for the battery. Young will play ;
first and Strohn will hold down the third bag. !
This will leave second base open, as ex-Cap- i
tain Lougheed will go to his old position at '
short. "With Murphy, Chandler, Crandall, Car- I
son, Kahn and probably Phil Wilson to select
from a good outfield should be found. : In the
loss of Lon Freeman, who left Â college last
semester for the Klondike, the outfield is de
prived of Its best man.
Of the freshman aspirants who have come Into
notice so far Wright and Young have done the
best work. The former plays a fast infield j
and throws quickly and accurately. The lat- i
ter shows up well at first, his game being very'
similar to' that of his brother.
' Most of the match. games this year will be
played on the campus. < The first game will
be on February 4 â¢ with the Fireman's Fund
i Insurance nine. At present it looks as though
I the intercollegiate contests will not come off
I In San Francisco on account â¢ of â  the grounds
j being already engaged by the league. In the
| event that a diamond In San Francisco cannot
I be secured one game will be played on each
college campus. The last . match will take
place In San Jose If a league date Is not
I broken. C. P. CUTTEN.

McCUTCHEN WON THE CUP.
Golfers Played a Handicap Match on
the Presidio Links Yesterday. '
The event set down for yesterday after
noon upon the programme of the San
Francisco Golf Club was men's foursomes,
! with handicap. Although the afternoon
| was very, fine and the links in excellent
I condition after the rain, the event was
| abandoned and a handicap match at eigh
teen holes, medal play, substituted for the
foursomes. S. L. Abbott Jr. went round
the links twice, but made no returns, as
he had no intention of contesting for the
cup offered as a prize. The scores and
handicaps were. as follows:

Club were out on the San Francisco
course yesterday.' They were Messrs.

last two of whom played as representa

I Francisco team which visited Oakland on
December 10 of last. year.

I Cisco Golf Club, Miss Helen Deane and
! Miss E. W. Morgan, the latter the holder
I of the Wlnslow medal for January, were
I out on the links.
WILL BATTLE
NEXT TUESDAY
THE National Club is fortunate in hav
ing secured such good talent for Its
entertainment which will be held at
Woodward's Pavilion Tuesday evening.
Frank McConnell, the clever pugilist,
will meet the hard punching Al Neill in
a twenty-round contest." McConnell has
trained very hard ,for this game, as it
.-:..; . will certainly be his last in case **o
meets his Waterloo. His friends are very sanguine of his success and will bet
. Neill Is a fighter who can stand a terrific punching, and. although not as
clever a man as his opponent, he expects, nevertheless, to put McConnell to
sleep when the knockout is least expected. Y'yf.
The preliminaries are, in fact, of equal importance. "Cocker" Tweedie. the
clever Australian, will meet the speedy Charley Tye in a bout of fifteen rounds,
and if not finished when the gong sounds the last round, the agreement reads
that the contestants must continue the battle until a winner is announced. The
third event will consist of a 10-round hurricane contest between "Jockey" May
nard and Willie Cole, which will also continue until the referee. Is satisfied as
to which of the men is entitled to a decision in his favor. Altogether, the Na
tionals have a first-class athletic bi.l of fare. -y-y yf-.y^y ". Y=yf\r : .

Seattle; Defeats the
Athletics.
BASEBALLAND PYROTECHNICS
ONE OF THE PRETTIEST GAMES
SEEN AT RECREATION PARK.
Four Double Plays Added Consider
ably to the Fervor
" â¢ ." of the Proceed
ings.
Nine young men from Seattle, athletic
of appearance and action, albeit they may
have been trained down a trifle, fine, owing
to the long spell of duck weather, ca
vorted around Recreation Park yesterday
afternoon and illustrated to the small but
select crowd of spectators what they
could do in the way of ball-playing with
a fresh supply of meal tickets in sight.
Their opponents were the Athletics of
i this city, and though the locals put up
a fast game from start to finish and
outbatted the northerners, the holes they
tore in their fielding were responsible tor
their defeat. The game was for the bene
fit of the Seattles, who have been brought
to a strange city and grief through over
i confidence in Mr. Doyle, baseball impre
! sario of the Queen City, and exhibition
1 games, as a rule, are not interesting, But
yesterday's contest proved an exception,
and had there been enough people pres-
I ent to have made a noise over the emo
i tional episodes that marked the contest
j from start to finish,- they would all have
gone home with sore throats.
For instance, there was Babbitt of Se
| attle, and Billings of the home team. Tne
i way those two infielders worked their re
i spective garden-patches was astonishing,
i and when in the third Babbitt put tiie
center ornament on his playing by going
i up in the air several feet ana pulling uown
with his left hand what ought to have
been a half-mile dash trom McCarthy's
bat, those who witnessed the perform
ance went wild with delight.
Meany, out in center for the Athletics,
duplicated Babbitt's catch, when in the
sixth Clark cut one loose that sailed out
and up like a hot-air balloon without the
paracnute attachment. It looked good to
clear the fence, but Meany glued his box
: ing mitt to it; and would not be divorced.
Four double plays added to the fervor
of the proceedings, and altogether the
spectators received a dollar's worth of
sport for a quarter. The Athletics were
first up and scored two runs, McCarthy
reaching first on a half blocker*, hit,. and
completing the circuit on Meany's double
to left field fence. Meany went to third
on McLaughlin's out at first and scored
on Kleiber's fumble of HUdebrant'
shot. That was all they could do for the
balance of the game. , i
Seattle broke the ice in the fourth, when
Parrott uncorked a good thing, dark
drove one at Whalen, who threw wide to
second to head off Parrott, and "Tacks"
continued on to third, scoring a moment
on Kleiber's hit to short, which forced
Clark at second. They took one more in
the fifth, when Babbitt was presented
with a base, stole another and reached
third on Anderson's punch to short, which
got away from McLaughlin. Meany's
muff of Josh Riley's fly let him home.
Matters ran along with the tally list
tied up until the eighth, when < Seattle
won the game, Anderson making the cir
cuit on a base on balls, two sacrifices and
Hanley's error of Clark's drive. The

GOOD BETTING
ON COURSING
AT INGLESIDE
New Dogs That Sur
prised the Talent.
ST. ORIN FOOLED TULLAMORE
HICKS RAN RINGS AROUND OLD
GLEN ROY.
Connemara, Mountain Beauty, Jenny
: Wilson Lady Herschel and "Vic
'''â  tor Queen Should Do Well
''"' To-Day.
A very large and enthusiastic crowd
was present at Ingleside Coursing Park
yesterday, and the poolsellers wore happy
faces, as the betting on each course was
very lively. Several thousand dollars
changed hands during the day.
The coursing was much better than
the club expected, as the. hares, although
not. running as long and punishing trials
as were noticeable before the grass made
its appearance, ran, nevertheless, with
great vim and dash, and as a consequence
the dogs that' were rated as being "good
workers" had the better of. the game of
flick and kill. f'Jf 'i
The interesting features of the day's
coursing. were the grueling. runs in which
Carlotta and Big Buck and Black Hawk
and Free Silver .figured.. Carlotta proved
that she was entitled to the name of
"stayer," and in the latter part of the
race she scored rapidly on her opponent.
Black Hawk easily disposed of Free Sil
ver. Still, his metal was thoroughly
tested by the game little hare, who gave
him a two minutes and twelve seconds
run around the big field.
It was expected that Thornhill was
more than a match for Conqueror, but ow
ing to an injury he received a few weeks
ago his owner did not expect to see him
run up to his record, and was ' conse
quently timid* about backing him to win.
Torsido and/Terrona did not run up to
their accustomed form, and as a result
the talent felt sore in pocket. Homer, the
dog that sent Torsido to his kennel with a
gocse egg tied to his tail, made her first
appearance yesterday at the Ingleside
Park, and if a line can be drawn from
her inaugural performance she is very
liable to take the knowing ones by sur
prise to-day. ' However, it would not be
advisable for the ones who know it all to
forget her when she meets Conqueror,
who had two courses yesterday with
Thornhill.
Mayflower ran an in-and-out race with
Campania and should have captured a
flag if she ran true. She is certainly a
very unreliable performer. . â ':â :< ;->-'-.
â  Glen Roy ran up to his usual form,
which means that he seemingly prefers
to allow his' opponent to do the work
while he remains benind to see the fun.
He was beaten by Hicks pointless. Hicks
is a , recent importation from Australia
and has a brilliant future.
St. Orin is also a green dog to the cours
ing fields. He made his initial appearance
in a stake race yesterday ana ran a re
markably fast course,' beating Tullamore
in a good trial to the escape. He should
be heard from to-day.
Doubtless Connemara, Mountain Beauty,
Jenny Wilson and St. Orin will figure in
the final rounds of to-day's meeting. The
Call of yesterday called thirty winners
out of thirty-six courses. The result of
the run-down is appended: '-i-

AMERICANS AND
FILIPINOS CLOSE
TO ARMED CONFLICT
The Incident Explained Away, but It
Shows That the Tension at Manila
Is Still Extreme.
MANILA, Jan. 8 (via Hongkong, Jan. 21).^â The Americans and Filipinos were prob
ably nearer a conflict this afternoon than at any time since, the occupation. Fortunately the
matter was amicably settled. . A Filipino lieutenant, imagining that his men had been insulted
by some American troops, marched a company of forty armed natives to the lines of the
Americans, and the sentries, four in number, men of the Montana regiment, in obedience to
orders, were compelled to retire to the outpost in order to avoid trouble, as the Filipinos
disobeyed the command to -halt/deployed in the canebrake and assumed a determined, threat
ening attitude.
Lieutenant Jansen, who was in command of the post, telegraphed to brigade head
quarters, and General Otis personally investigated the matter. The Filipino captain was sum
moned, and he was found to be much excited. As a result of the conference he admitted that
the Filipino lieutenant had exceeded his authority. His men were drawn up in line, saluted,
courtesies were exchanged, and the Filipinos retired. Â» ,
The incident is significant, as it shows the tendency of the Filipinos to disregard
pickets, knowing that the Americans are not willing to commence hostilities; and it also dem
onstrated the danger of irresponsible . junior officers of the Filipino army precipitating
trouble at any moment. â¢
MANILA, Jan. 18, via Hongkong, Jan.
21.â A proclamation, purporting to be
issued by an American and slgned'" W.
T.," appeared on Friday and appealed
in broken English to brother Americans
and comrades to let the Filipinos alone
and that "if their officers compelled
them to lire to please fire in the air."
The proclamation also appealed to
Americans to disregard Filipinos "who
pretend to favor annexation" and al
leged "that the American agitation to
hold the islands Is fostered by a few
officers who are making money there
by." "
The proclamation concluded with par
aphrasing the Monroe doctrine In th*'
words "The Philippines for the Fili
pinos."
A native dentist here named Arevolo
has been arrested. He denies the au
thorship of the document, but admits
connection with it. Other arrests are
probable. Arevolo has been twice Im
prisoned by the Spanish for treason.
He was formerly an aid of Agulnaldo
and his arrest caused consternation
anion-; the Filipinos.
The native paper, La Independence,
Which Is now published at Malolos, was
unusually vindictive to-day. Comment
ing upon the situation it says: "The
Americans are trying all the time to
excite the Filipinos to commence hos
tilities, In th*' meantime tricking the
natives for the purpose of gaining time
necessary for bringing out reinforce
ments.
"The proclamation, which was sup
pressed, and for which Arevolo was ar
rested, appears to have hit the nail on
the head. The Filipinos need fear noth
ing. The American soldiers are com
pletely demoralized. They are unwilling
to fight a free people who are only de
manding their rights."
The idea of possible deception is prob
ably more general than the authorities
know. A Filipino officer said to the cor
respondent that it was ridiculous for
the Americans to think that the Fili
pinos believe they are bringing more
troops and warships here to establish
a protectorate over a country for which
J20.000.000 had been paid.
The Malolos paper says the govern
ment is inflexible and Aguinaldo's de
termined attitude seems to have tem
porarily welded all factions together.
REBELS ARE FORTIFYING
GUIMARAS ISLAND
' MANILA, Jan. 15, via Hongkong,
Jan. 21.â Private advices received here
from Iloilo differ materially from the
official reports. They say the rebels
have completed their fortifications there
and that they are not fortifying Oui
maras Island. The American forces are
still on board the transports, which are
anchored close to Guimaras Island. The
rebel authorities at Iloilo have granted
permission to land armed parties not
exceeding five In number, if accom
panied by a native officer. The offer
was declined. The rebels subsequently
permitted officers to land, furnishing
them with an escort. . .
President Lopez of the Vlsayan Fed
eration has replied to President McKin
ley's proclamation of the 9th. He claims
that the revolutionary government an
tedates the Paris treaty by over two
years. He says he has never been
officially notified of the existence of the
treaty and that therefore he declines to
recognize American authority and re
fuses to allow Americans to disembark
in force without express orders from the
government at Malolos. General Miller,
the commander of the American expe
dition, replied that the Americans can
not recognize President Lopez' author
ity because the Filipino republic is not
recognized by the powers. "He also ex
pressed regret at the determination of
the Filipinos to resist just claims.
The United States gunboat Petrel and
the Spanish gunboat El Cano are near
Iloijo.
The natives at the fort mistook the
United States cruiser Baltimore's meal
pennant for a challenge and hoisted a
red rag on the fort thrice daily, lower
ing it simultaneously with the Balti
more's pennant.
The United States transport Indiana
has gone to Iloilo with dispatches to
General Miller from General Otis and
coal supplies for the expedition. The
"British second-class cruiser Bonaven
tura and the German second-class
'cruiser Irene have returned here. Both
the iloilo banks have sent their treasure
here.
The American and Filipino commis
sioners are reported to have conferred
at the Filipino Club with unsatisfactory
results. The natives allege that they
must have official recognition before
discussing the question of a protector
ate. Another conference Is believed to
have been arranged for to-morrow
night, but the officials here decline to
confirm or deny this statement.
Coasting steamers which have ar
rived lure report that the natives are
fortifying Pal bay og and, the island of
Bamar, refusing to allow Americans to
land here. The garrison consists of a
thousand men armed with spears and
bolos. They have only six rifles.
Owing to persistent rumors of a con
templated attack upon Manila on
Saturday and Sunday, the American
troops were confined to their Quarters,
nil the guards were doubled and as a
measure of caution foreign Hags
were l displayed on the business and
private bouses everywhere, as on the
day of the entry of the Americans into
this city. The Escolta, the usually busy
thoroughfare, was deserted on Saturday
night. A score of groundless, alarmist
rumors are still abroad, but confidence
is being restored.
FINAL CONFERENCE WITH â¢
PHILIPPINE COMMISSION
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21â Secretary
Hay had what will probably be the
final conference with the members of
the Philippine Commission to-day and
gave them full instructions on every
point that is likely to arise. It was
stated that Professors Schurman and
Worcester would leave Washington
next Tuesday, and that Mr. Denby
would follow to Manila at the conclu
sion of his duties with the War In
vestigating Commission. It is learned
beyond question that the commission
will have no executive powers. It will
be an advisory council in the full sense
of the term, although two of the mem
bers. Admiral Dewey and General Otis,
may carry out policies laid down by
the commission in their own single
executive capacity as military and
naval commanders. There appears to
be a confidence entertained at the War
Department that the status quo can be
i maintained in the Philippines until the
arrival of this commission, a belief
probably based on the character of the
instructions given .to General Otis.. ;,-â¢
The War Department has not been
advised of any change hi the disposi
tion of General Miller's troops, -which,
at last report, were lying before Iloilo,
although it is assumed that he has car
ried out the project formerly mentioned
by him of landing, on Guimaras Island
just off the harbor of Iloilo.
SUGGEST AN ENGLISHMAN
FOR PHILIPPINE GOVERNOR
LONDON, Jan. 21.â British Investors
in the Philippines are curiously ignor
ant of American politics and are seri
ously discussing the possibility of Pres
ident McKinley appointing an English
man to govern the islands. They argue
that it is impossible to find in America
an experienced administrator acquaint
ed with the character of the Filipinos,
and suggest the name of ex-Governor
Creagh of British Borneo, who is now
living in England, as being eminently
qualified and willing to take the post.
Some financiers are beginning to take
a gloomy view of the future of the Phil
ippines. Mr. Ernest Ruffert. the head
of a Lombard-street house, who
bought large tracts of land about Ma
nila, said to a representative of the
Associated Press: "The land is useless
under the sent conditions. We could
not plant crops with the possibility of
the natives destroying them over night.
The United States will be unable to rule
more than the fringe of the islands
without an army of 100,000 men. They
might buy the natives' leaders, but
they would not stay bought and the
United States must rebuy them period
ically. The end of the matter .will be
that the United States will sell the
Philippines." - 'â¢'*_*'
FOR RELEASE OF THE
SPANISH PRISONERS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.â War
Department has cabled General Otis,
asking if the Spanish prisoners held by
the insurgents have been released. It
is evident from this that the Govern
ment is moving toward the ..execution
of 6 of the peace treaty, by
which the United States undertook to
obtain the release of all Spanish pris
oners in the hands of the insurgents in
the Philippines, and at its own cost to
return these prisoners to their homes.
There were reports during the day that
the release of . prisoners had actually
begun, but Secretary Alger said he had
not been advised of this release, al
though he was making inquiries as to
the situation. y : y Y'y.y
The number of Spanish prisoners is
considerable, running Into the thou
sands. At one time Admiral Dewey re
ported the. capture of several thousand
Spaniards by the insurgents, and one
of the witnesses before the Paris Com
mission testified that between 7000 and
SOOO Spaniards had surrendered to. the
insurgents. Quite a number of the pris
oners are monks and friars.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.â Tbe Oregon

coal at Honolulu, according to the offi
j cials at the Navy Department. The
dispatch of the ocean-going tug Iro
quois yesterday, from San Francisco to
Honolulu, was not inspired by a desire
to change the Oregon's orders, for as
a matter of fact the Navy Department
arranged two months ago to put the
Iroquois to use as a dispatch boat be

DICK CROKER
ON FREE SILVER
NEW YORK, Jan. 20.â Richard
Croker, in an Interview last night, said:
"The 16 to 1 question Is a dead issue.
This was proved conclusively by the
expression of the will of the people in
1896, when they elected Mr. McKlnlev.
"Now the Democrats of the West
and other sections of the country are
trying to foist this dead issue uoon the
Democratic party and to make the old
dead cry of '16 to 1' the Democratic
slogan in 1900. Why should we carry a
dead weight in that campaign? The
times of four years ago arc past. To
day the times are different and the
issues are not the same.
"Speaking for this ' section of the
country say that if the 16 to 1 question
is again brought before' the people
there will be felt again throughout the
nation the same distrust, that prevailed
in 1896. During the fall of that year,
while the campaign was in progress,
every man with a dollar of surplus,
whether he was millionaire or working
man, hoarded his savings, in fact,
locked them up so securely that there
was actually no money in circulation.
As i a natural consequence the times
then became well nigh desperate. Look
back at the winter of 1896 and see what
the mere rumor of silver coinage at the
ratio of 16 to 1 did to this country.
You could not get money in the banks.
You could not raise money on any kind
of security and the result was the very
hardest kind of hard times. ' y-^f
"From the South and West there al
ways comes the hue and cry against
New York because it is the money cen
ter of the United States. But whenever
there is any great public improvement
to be made in any section of this coun
try the first look for help is toward
New York. They rush to our great city
to raise the money. They come for the
means to build their railways, fo con
struct their waterworks, to erect their
plants for gas service and bond their
sites for any kind of Improvement.
Then, no matter Row much benefit is
derived from this section of the coun
try, there is always the same howl
against the great city because it is the
money centerâ that very center without
which public improvements would be
an Impossibility. *
"If : this silver question comes again
before the people and is made a factor
in the national platform the moneyed
men of the Bast will look for invest
ment outside of this country and the
banks in other States in the Union will
not be enabled to borrow money in the
East. The result will be that the poor
will be the great sufferers. The free
silver Issue is merely a local issue. In
the sections where free silver will ben
efit the residents it is but natural for
them to declare for 16 to 1. . However,
in my opinion the money question
should bo settled by Congress. - r â¢â 
"But here in New -York we must see
to it that the position of our party on
the money question must meet the re
quirements not of any one section, but
of every section of the United States.'
CHEMICALS IN
THE SEDIMENT
Acids Found in Army
Beef.
PROF. CLARKE SO TESTIFIES
VERIFIES SOME OF SURGEON
' DALY'S EVIDENCE.
However, the War Inquiry Commis
sion Indicates That It Does Not
Believe the Meat Was .
_ - : : Bad.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.â Professor
Clarke, chemist of the United "States
Geological Survey, to-day reported to
the War Investigation Committee that
his test. of the powder furnished' by
Surgeon Daly as being the residue from
tbe boiling-down of a portion of the
condemned beef on the Panama, dis
closed the presence of both boric and
salicylic acids.
Professor Clarke ; took the witness
stand and was closely examined. Wit
ness said he could say nothing of the
origin of the j materials tested, â  nor
cou'd he state the probable amount of
these chemical agents used that would
be extracted in making tea from, the
beef without more material and longer
time. Large quantities of such chem
icals for preservatives, however, he
said, would be unnecessary and would
be an expensive waste. The boracic
acid, he said, imparts no odor what,
to meat. The salicylic acid, also, he
said, was odorless and he could net say
whether it forms any compounds with
the fi-.h of cuttle that would produce
odor.
"Would it not be probable," he was
asked, "that meat kept for a time vary
ing from one to twelve . weeks in
cold storage, covered by cheesecloth,
would be affected by the substances In
the cheesecloth?" -"- \.
"I should think so," was the reply.
"Is it possible to get both these agents
present?" *
"Yes. We found both ln the material
submitted, purporting to be a meat ex
tract." f:yf- ,y-fy*
"It does not necessarily follow, then,"
suggested General Beaver, "that the
product you examined came from beef
tea?"
"No, I did not inquire into its origin."
General' Beaver read from Surgeon
Daly's report on the beef on the Pan
ama procured at Ponce, saying some
of it tasted like "decomposed boric
acid." >
"Now," he asked, "if there is any
perceptible taste in boric acid would
its use in any quantity in meat impart
any such taste?" -
\"I should say not," answered the
witness. .Â«
â¢f "Then' we have disposed of that,"
commented General Beaver.
Witness said he knew of no. such
thing as decomposed boric acid and
that from a scientific point of view the
expression was meaningless; that boric
acid hi such quantities as likely would
be used would leave no taste in the
mouth of an Individual, as had been
testified to yesterday by Surgeon Daly.
, "Would the | treatment of boric or
salicylic acid make any difference in
the odor or stench from decayed beef?"
interrupted ex-Governor Woodbury.
"That would take actual experiment,",
was the reply; "there might be some
slight product of putrefaction."
Asked as to the effect on health of
using beef injected with the boric acid,
witness said it would be relatively
.harmless, 1 but that the use of salicylic
acid would be different and was pro
hibited by most European countries.
The boric acid: on meat furnished
troops, in his opinion/Would be of very
little importance from a health view,
but the salicylic acid would be objec
tionable. The effect of the preservatives,
was to make the meat keep longer. If
the meat were kept twenty-four hours
after leaving the refrigerator the chem
icals might retard putrefaction. *â¢
"If the boric acid were used In the
meat would it impart, as has been testi
fied to, a taste so bitter,' nauseous and
unpalatable as to make it unfit for
use?" Witness was asked, and he re
plied. "No, sir." '
" " Paymaster Henry G. Colbert of the
navy, testified to large ' purchases of
beef for the navy. The purchases were
from the same firm which supplied the
army. He said the meat gave general
satisfaction and there were no com
plaints. When asked if there were any
evidences; of chemicals being used he
answered in the negative. -"

WASHINGTON, Jan. 21.â Senate
to-day passed the Nicaragua canal bill,
decided to make the anti-scafping bill
the unfinished business and continued
without completion the consideration of
the Indian appropriation bill. A num
ber of amendments were made to the
Nicaragua bill, and there .were innum
erable short speeches during the day.
There was, however, no opposition to
a vote when the time came and a roll
'call on.lt developed only six votes in
opposition to final passage. The anti
scalplng bill was taken up on a vote of
33 to 21, but no effort was then made
to resume the consideration. * The re
sult of the vote was to give it the first
place on the- calendar, but the under
standing is that it shall not be pressed
in opposition to the peace treaty or the
appropriation bills. :.â¢'_...
The Nicaragua canal bill as it is
passed continues the name of the Mar
itime Canal Company. It provides for
the issuance of 1,000,000 shares of stock
at $100 a share. The: canal capital is
required to call In all the stock issued
except that held by the Nicaraguan and
Costs. Rican governments. The com
pany is also required to redeem and
cancel bonds and script heretofore is
sued by the company and to satisfy all
cash liabilities. To enable the com
pany to comply with these require
ments treasury warrants to the amount
of $5,000,000 are authorized with a pro
viso to the effect that only so much
of the amount shall be paid as shall
be required to pay the actual cash
value of the rights, privileges, fran
chises and property at the time of the
payment, the value to be determined
by commissioners to be appointed by
the President. This being done, the
Secretary of the Treasury is author
ized to subscribe for 925,000 shares of
the company's stock for the Govern
ment of the United States. The present
members of the board of directors are
then to resign and a board of seven ls
to be appointed, consisting or five, in
behalf of the United States, and one
each in behalf of Nicaragua and Costa
Rica. The directors on behalf of the
United States are to be appointed. by
the President and confirmed by the
Senate. No two of them are to be res
idents of any one State, and no person
who has heretofore been interested in
the canal company is to be appointed
to this office. They are also prohibited
from being Interested in contracts on
the canal.- Each of the directors ex
cept the president is to receive a sal
ary of $5000 a year and the president Is
to have $6000. All traveling expenses
are to be paid. Annual reports are re
quired. ' There is a provision against
declaring a dividend except upon the
net earnings. The company is author
ized to contract for the completion of
the canal within six years. The pay
ments are restricted to $20,000,000 an
nually. The can?" is to be large enough
"for the use of the largest sea-going
vessels, at a cost not exceeding the esti
mate of the engineers and not to exceed
$115,000,000."
This . amount is made a permanent
appropriation for the work, to be used
as occasion may require. The bill gives
the Government a lien upon the prop
erty to secure the repayment of the
moneys advanced, and the President Is
empowered to declare forfeiture of thÂ«
property to the United States, without
the necessity of judicial or other ascer
tainment. The President is authorized
to suspend payments at any time. The
President is also authorized to secur_
any change in or modification of tha
terms of the concession either from tha
â concessionaires or from Nicaragua and
Costa Rica. In case of the failure in
such negotiations the President is also
empowered to negotiate for anotheh
route across the Isthmus. He is fur
ther requested to open negotiations. for
the abrogation of the Clayton-Bulwe*
treaty, or any other treaty found to be
in existence and standing in the way
of the construction of the canal. Tha
neutrality of the canal is guaranteed;
but the right to protect it against the
interruptions of business between the
Atlantic and . Pacific coasts of the
United States Is reserved.

His Plan to Destroy All Disease
Germs by Filling the Body
i With Electricity Declared
to Be an Old One.
A Doctor Claims to Have Prac-
ticed the Same Plan for
Twenty Years.
HIS METHODS EXPLAINED.
i
To the Editor of The Call: Following is the substance of a long arti-
cle printed in your paper a few days ago, purporting to be the story of a
new departure in Electrical science. The article describes an invention
which has been generally credited to Nicola Tesla, although no mention of
. his name is made in this story. I append the important part:
ELECTRIC CURRENT TO BE UTILIZED
WITH MIRACULOUS EFFECT
Claimed to Be the Most Important and Remarkable
Discovery of Modern Times.
Will Alleviate Pain, Destroy the Bacilli of Disease and Tend to
the Prolongation of Human Life. \
Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, Dec. 30.
A new discovery In electricity and electro-therapeutics will be an-
nounced as soon as certain papers have been filed in the United States Pat-
ent Office. ' This discovery or new application of electricity to the science
of therapeutics wiU, it is claimed, startle the world. It is nothing short
of miraculous, and will prove to be the most important and beneficial dis-
covery of modern times, for it will alleviate 'pain, destroy the bacilli of
disease and tend to prolong human life.
These -meager facts were obtained from a lawyer of national reputation
who is now in Washington arranging preliminaries for filing ,an applica- .
tion for a patent. He positively refused to explain the process by which"
the electricity is to be applied : to therapeutics, but promised to give a state-
ment to the press when all was ready.
, . â 
The article goes on to describe how the idea was to turn the human
body, into a sponge, as it were, for the absorption of a great force of Elec-
tricity which, when it had saturated the nerve cells and tissues with its
life, would destroy all disease germs, arouse the dormant energies and, by
renewing the element of nerve life, give the patient a new existence, as if he
had been born again. - "b
Dr. McLaughlin's Method of Filling the Body With Electricity.
Now this is all reasonable. It is possible to do what this Inventor
claims. I know that It can be done, for it has been done. I have been do-
ing this very thing for twenty years. You have printed my advertisements
day after day for years, In which I have explained my system of treat-
ment. I have offered the most reasonable, common sense arguments and
given volumes of proof to show that I not only could, but had, in thou-
sands of cases made the grandest specimens of physical manhood out of
thousands of wrecksâ out of men whose nervous systems had been drained
of their Electrical energy, and who would have been in their graves long ago
had it not been for my treatment.
I am glad that at this late day the newspapers see fit to recognize
the fact that Electricity has a power over disease, and that it can be used
to destroy all the elements which tend to break down the health of the
r nation. I have proven this in thousands of cases and have published
enough testimonials to fill your. Sunday paper, but I have been laboring
under' several disadvantages: First, the influence of the medical profes-
sion, which, naturally opposes anything intended to take the place of drugs; '
second, the prejudice of certain people against Electricity, as they know it,
as given in a physician's office, by means of nerve racking shocks; and
third, the great number of cheap, trashy', so-called Electric belts sold by
drugstores for profit only, and by the quickly disappearing huckster who
peddles his wares from town to town.
_>. Now, sir, briefly stated, my case is this: The Dr. Sanden Electric
Beit, which I have been selling for twenty years and to which I have added
various improvements in recent months, is worn around the waist by the
patient while sleeping. It infuses Electricity in the shape of. a mild, gentle
warmth directly into the nerve centers, conveying It throughout the en-
tire body by : means of electrodes applied to tbe seat of disease. It can be
felt by the wearer, and is easily regulated. By this means it takes from
four to eight hours to fill the whole nervous system with Electricity. It
is done slowly, and I contend that Electricity given to the body in this way
lasts longer, charges the body more thoroughly and does more actual good
than the current applied in aÂ» shock for a few moments. This is the ar-
gument which I. offer to men of reason. It is the argument which has
a Â»Â°x^ -^ y eas and the 10 - 000 grateful men who are now shouting for DR.
hAS DEN'S ELECTRIC BELT and proclaiming its virtues to the world are
tne. monuments to my success. These men are everywhere. There is "not
a town in this State which has not one. They tell me that my twenty
jears G-. labor has been successful, that it is more successful now than ever
Deiore, and I proclaim that my method of restoring health, power and hap-
piness to both men and women is; o>der. better and will live longer than
any other method now known to science.
â â â¢,.:^ I . ha it a ,1 " , book describing, my method of treating disease. It Is en-
titled. Three Classes of Men." I will send it closely sealed, free to any
one wno writes, or will explain my plan and give a free test of my won,

in pursuit of the elusive bunch of feathers with the <_>

LOST ALL THEIR TACKLE.
Nearly a Thousand Dollars' Worth of
Illegal Fishing Gear Seized.
Deputy Fish Commissioners Davis and
Low returned yesterday from . a trip up
the bay and rivers in the launch Quinnat,
leaving behind them a large number of
very profane and angry fishermen. The
cause of the latter' s annoyance was that
the deputies had seized nearly $1000 worth
of their illegal fishing gear. Most of the
stuff- was sturgeon hooks, lines and an
chors and one net; The" net was found
off Roe Island and It was seized because
the meshes were under size according to
the standard established by the State
law. It is worth about $160, or would cost
that much to replace it. > " '- ._
On the 19th inst. sixteen . sections . of
sturgeon gear and two anchors were con
fiscated in Elk Slough. On the same day
a run was made over to Marsh Landing,
where' sixteen sections more were found
and taken up. FoOr anchors were raised
with this lot. Nine sections and two an
chors rewarded the deputies by dragging
Broad Slough on the same day.
On Friday thirty sections and four an
chors were confiscated near McNears
Landing, making s.venty-one sections of
line and twelve anchors worm from $4 to
$6 each. As there is 100 feet to a section,
the total length of the lines was 7100
feet. The lines were fitted out with about
5500 hooks, which were destroyed. This
is the largest haul of illegal fishing gear
that has been made for a long time.
Word was received yesterday that Man
uel Quartx and John Silvia, who had
been arrested by Deputy Johnson for
spearing steelhead salmon in Redwood
Canyon, had been fined $25 each by Justice
of the Peace Bellrude of Santa Rosa The
culprits had been destroying dozens of
fish by throwing- there out upon the banks
of the stream v with pitchforks.

was probably lost at sea off the coast of
San Salvador on December 3. The de
tails were contained in a letter from
United States Consul Baruch at San Sal

an Italian and eight Salvadorenos, went
out in a launch to meet one of the mall
steamers, and were carried out. to sea by
a gale blowing off shore. From that date
until December 31 they had not been seen

CAUGHT WHILE SMUGGLING
HYPNOTIZED A GRAND JURY
BUT LOST A SOLID FRIEND.
Captain March Became Disgusted
With. His Parsimony and Read

y^.. Class. -'-;!' Jil
â 
A story Is going the rounds concern
ing Lieutenant Surgeon Zacharias T.
Mallaby, the moral of which is that one
can lose money by being too thrifty.
Mallaby is a doctor, regular in his.
diploma and habits, and went from this
city to Manila some months ago as an
army surgeon. The story Is to the ef
fect that his thrift cost him $10,000.
Mallaby became very well acquainted
with Captain March of the Astor Bat
tery while in the Philippines and the
captain thought so much of him that
he promised to get him a $10,000 per
year salary as a physician in New
York. The two friends returned to this
port a few days ago on the Government
transport Ohio. Mallaby was caught
by a customs inspector going down. the
gang plank of the steamer with forty
yards of smuggled silk around his body
next to his shirt. The lieutenant sur
geon's coat and vest were taken off
and the silk reeled off the chagrined
smuggler Just as if he were trout fish
ing. Then he- was arrested and the
case was taken before the Federal
Grand Jury.
Mallaby was represented by Bert
Schlesinger, and in- pursuance of. his
constitutional right the lieutenant sur
geon Insisted upon appearing before the
jury and pleading his cause. .Permis
sion was given and Mallaby made a
clean breast of his guilt and begged for
mercy. He had bought the silk for his
wife, he said, and he was too poor to
pay the duty on it. Besides that, he
thought that the Government was real
mean to expect to collect duties from
men like himself, who were returning
after having fought and bled and suf
fered so hard for this glorious Union.
Then he shed a tear or two (crocodile
variety) and the jury determined then
and there to ignore the bill, which they
did. , â¢-;--.:.. â,.'.-_ :,...-
Captain March did not take the same
view of the case as did the jury. . He
expressed himself plainly to the effect
that a man who would be mean enough
to try to smuggle goods in on Uncle
Sam would be mean enough to be real
mean. Therefore when he again met
the lieutenant surgeon and was re
minded of his promise he curtly in
formed the lieutenant surgeon that a
man who would descend to smuggling
could not move in his class and that he
would cut his acquaintance.
Wherefore has the lieutenant surgeon
resumed his practice in this city, .while
Captain March is thrilling the belles
and beaux of New York upper tendom
with harrowing tales of adventures and
great perils in the Philippines.
HOT CHASE AFTER A
NOTORIOUS PICKPOCKET
EDWARD BROOKS WAS WORKING
. THE ORPHEUM CROWD.
He Was Discovered and Ran Several
Blocks Before Being Overtaken
by Detective Gibson.
Edward Brooks, alias "Australian Ed
die," a notorious pickpocket, was work
ing the crowd in front of the Orpheum
yesterday afternoon, when an outcry was
made by a gentleman who felt Brooks'
hand in his pocket. Brooks dashed out of
the crowd and Detective T. B. Gibson,
who happened to be there, started in pur
suit. â¢ fy'^Yy '"-
. Brooks ran down O'Farrell street and
Into a saloon on the corner of .Stockton.
The ' detective was at his heels and
he , made his exit by the O'Farrell
street entrance. He* continued his flight
along O'Farrell street and disappeared
into the Oberon and . out again. He
doubled back and rushed into the Phe
lan building, where Gibson overtook him.
He. offered fight and after a sharp tussle
Gibson succeeded in handcuffing him.
When they reached the City Prison both
were still panting for breath.
Brooks attempted to throw away a
leather purse, but Gibson managed to ob
tain possession of it. Written on the flap
was the address "C. Buntsch, 500 Bat
tery street.'-' It was -empty, but is sup
posed to have- contained money when
Brooks got possession of it. He also tried
to swallow a mutilated quarter of a dol
lar that had been evidently used as a
watch opener. He had over $90 in gold
and silver and one of the gold coins was Â»
two-and-a-half-dollar - piece. He was
locked up In "the tanks" pending further
investigation. '
' Brooks is an Eastern crook and the po
lice credit him with being, the -smartest
pickpocket in the business. -He was a
partner of "Deafy" Morris, who tried to
stab â  Detective Silvey . when > arrested at
the Palace Hotel during the Hobson - re
ception. He; and "Deafy" and .William'

PLAN TO CHOP
OFF MR. RUFF
FROM BIG FEES
Right of Nomination
for Absent Next
of Kin.
THE AMENDMENT : PROPOSED
POSSIBILITIES OF ADMINISTRA
TOR'S OFFICE.
â  ' â
The Change Would Benefit Attorneys
Generally and Reduce the Re
turns of the Office One-
Half.
If Assembly bill No. -51, an act to
amend section 1369 of the .Code of Civil
Procedure, relating to the appointment of
administrators of deceased persons, be
carried,^, a howl will go up from the Pub
lic Administrator's office that will rise to
heaven, particularly from Abe Ruef, who
is Administrator Drinkhouse's attorney.
Under the present law the Public Ad
ministrator baa the right to administer
upon an estate when the next of kin are
absent from or are not bona fidÂ© residents
of the- State. -The amendment gives the
- absent heirs the right to nominate their
own' administrator, â¢' thus cutting off the
Public Administrator from j a large sec
tion -of- business. 'The particular sufferer,
should .the amendment pass, would be
the attorney of the Public Administrator,
whose income 'from his quasi-political of
fice depends upon the amount of business
of the office.
The bill . which . may effect the change
has been Introduced by Lawrence Devoto
of this city. Its text is as follows:
b' â¢" s' 1 Â«_ â¢â .â¢AN .-ACT â 
To amend Section 1369 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, relating to the appointment of ad
ministrators of deceased persona.

â  Section . 1. .' Section. one thousand three hun
dred and sixty-nine of the Code of Civil Pro

amended so as to read as follows:
" 1369. No- person Is competent or entitled to

entitled to share in the distribution of the es
tate, and are of the next of kin to any. deceased
person, or. If they were a resident of .the State,
would be entitled to administer upon the estate
of such deceased person, may rfomlnate any
competent person to act as such administrator
or administratrix -who is an actual resident of
the. State, ami such person shall have the pri
ority in - the . same manner, and decree as the
person who makes . such nomination, as pro
vided in - section , thirteen hundred and sixty
five of the Code of Civil Procedure.
-.-Sec. 2. .This- act shall take effect and be In
force from and after the Ist day of January,
1900. â¢-' Â«-â¢ --â -â â ">' â¢ â¢ Â
v The amendment upon the existing law
commences with the word ! "provided" . In
the ; fourth section. In : force ' and effect
it would change the monetary value of
the Public Administrator's office so great
ly that there would be nothing but pro
longed â¢ weepings and hafr-pulllngs ;by all
its occupants. * So , much of the business
of a Public Administrator is dependent
upon the absence of heirs that it Is more
than likely the hill will be foufcht by all
the Influence that can be brought against
it. What now goes to the, Public Admin
istrator's attorney would then be the
fruit of other attorneys; those who would
represent the absent heirs. ;
It Is said that the bill was introduced
for the purpose of distributing the emolu
ments that come from the Public Admin
istrator's office and which, figure up far
in the thousands. It has been customary
for former attorneys of the Public Admin
istrator to carry on a, system of "graft
ing? which covers the . county to Its ut
termost confines. The "grafters" scour
the city, wait upon the death of the poor
unfortunates without a family or -rela
tives to protect their, interests, and then
report to the attorney, whose' assistants,
armed with petitions for . letters of ad
ministration, pounce upon the courts.
Thus is the game made a big one and the
office so much sought after. â 
* With the amendment as law a great por
tion of this revenue would then be taken
out of the hands of the Public Adminis
trator, and distributed among the legal
profession at large. Some estimate the
possibility of the diminution as 1 one-half.

Germany Clings to a Hope
of Seating -iim on Sa

W. L. CHAMBERS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF SAMOA.
(From a Recent Photograph.)
NEW YORK, Jan. 21.â The Herald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: Germany has informed the United States and
Great Britain that if her Consul in Samoa has acted in the manner
described by American and British representatives he acted with
out authority and she will disavow his action, but that she can do
nothing until a full report of the recent disturbances has been re
ceived. By this explanation Germany does not mean it to be un
derstood that she disavows, in advance of knowledge of all the facts,
the course pursued by her Consul. She may uphold him. And, fur
thermore, she may call upon the United States for an explanation of
the decision of Chief Justice Chambers, and in any event will urge
its revision.- â  â¢ â¢â¢*-; â¢-;:**â¢;- ''f.. : X" j
It is admitted in all quarters that a blunder has been made. If
the German Consul is responsible his Government will remove him;
but if Mr. Chambers' decision was not proper, then a demand will
be made by the German Government for his relief. This is the status
to-day. of the Samoan question. . .
. Acting under the instructions sent yesterday afternoon, it is be
lieved at the State Department that the American and British Em
bassadors to Germany presented at the Berlin Foreign Office to-day
a joint note protesting against the action of the German Consul in
violating the provisions of the Berlin treaty, requesting a disavowal
of his acts and demanding his removal, and that of the German sub
ject, Herr Raffael, who was formerly president of the Municipal
Council of Apia, from Samoa. / .
In Washington Baron yon Holleben called upon Secretary Hay
armed with dispatches received by his Government from the German
Consul in Apia, which shows a different state of affairs than that in
dicated by the dispatches sent by the American Consul, and after he
left Sir Julian Pauncefote submitted to Secretary Hay . dispatches
received by his Government from the British Consul and giving the
result of a conference between the German Emperor and the British
Embassador in Berlin yesterday. â¢ 'j,'';,'
There is a wide variance between the official information re
ceived by this Government from Its representative in Apia and that
received by Germany from her Consul. The German Government,
however, contends that there can be no question of Mataafa's elec
tion, and Embassador yon Holleben gave Secretary Hay to under
stand his Government fully expected a revision of the decision
of the Chief Justice, and If it should not be In accord with the
facts, then it should be overruled and Mataafa declared King. The
authorities hold, however, under the treaty, that the decision of the
Chief Justice is binding upon the three treaty powers.
SMALL INTEREST TAKEN
IN GREAT BRITAIN
LONDON, Jan. 21.â Samoa commands
but small interest in Great Britain and
the belief seems to prevail that the dis
patches magnify the importance of the
Consuls' battles and that Germany will
manage to gracefully disavow the acts
of her agents.
A diplomat remarked that Germany
ls filling for the United States the roll
Russia has played in the eyes of the
Anglo-Saxon, the conspirator to be
looked for behind every war cloud. The
British Government, however, wel
comes the Samoan incident as another
link of the Anglo-American under
standing, which they are so desirous
of fostering.

Crossman Barnet.'and at the same -time
â¢ may neither tend to clear the person, most
under suspicion in the Adams, case nor to
establish the fact that he had an accom
plice, has been discovered by the police.
â¢ According to an admission- made to-Cap
tain McClusky to-day the discovery came
about through an inspection of thousands
of requests for samples of Kutnow pow
ders which the police -some weeks ago
acknowledged was in their hands. It was
a Kutnow powder containing cyanide of
, mercury that was sent to Barnet. and the
handwriting on the Cornish package and
that on the request sent to the Kutnow
fieople asking for a sample of the powder
s the same, according to William J. Mc-
Klnsley and David N. Carvaloe, the hand
writing experts.
This request asks for a sample of the
powder to be sent to a private letter box
address in this city. Postmaster Van
cott denies that it is a postoffice letter
, box, and. It is believed that the address
was a private letter-box In an uptown
store. It is said that the police have ac
cepted the theory that two persons were
concerned in the poison plot, and Captain
McClusky believes that the poisoner's ac
' complice ' wrote the letter now ln the
possession of the experts, as well as the
â¢ address- on the package sent to Cornish.
As soon as the latest reports are made by
Mi Kinsley, Carvaloe and Professor Wltt
haus. an "arrest, or possibly two arrests,
will be made. Captain McClusky said* to
' day that when an arrest was made it
'. would not be in Brooklyn or Newark, but

GLAD TO REOPEN THE
SAMOAN QUESTION
BERLIN, Jan. 21.â news from
Samoa has not caused great surprise
here. It was foreseen long ago that
trouble would break out sooner or later.
The tripartite arrangement has al

situation, which is really at the bottom
of the present disorder, although the
election dispute precipitated hostilities.
It can be safely said, however, that the
German Government is not particularly
annoyed at the fact that matters have
come to a crisis, as it will give Ger
many an opportunity for reopening the
Samoan question with the view of es

LONG RIDE WHILE WEAK FROM
LOSS OF BLOOD.
Was Believed to Be Dying, but Ral
lied, and Is Now Pronounced
in No Immediate
Danger.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. Melbourne
Chadbourne, son of F. S. Chadbourne,
formerly Harbor Commissioner of San
Francisco, met with a peculiar accident
on Wednesday last while on a hunting
trip in Mexico.
Chadbourne left Los Angeles two
weeks ago. to take a responsible posi
tion with the South j Bisbee Copper
Company. He accompanied the board
of directors, which is composed of Los
Angeles business men. The board, hav
ing elected officers, gave the employes
a holiday. Chadbourne, an ardent
sportsman, improved the opportunity
to go hunting, and in company., with
Samuel Hayhurst, who is ah expert
shot, he crossed the line on horseback
and entered Mexico. They stopped at
the ranch of the , Custom-house, in
which Hayhurst has an Interest, to get
luncheon. Having eaten they j retired
to vacant land adjoining the ranch to
practice snap shooting.
Chadbourne, who had a new model
Colt's double action 38-cailber revolver,
whipped the weapon from his belt and
at the same time pressed the trigger to
work a quick shot at the target. The
sight on the revolver caught on the
waistband of Chadbourne's trousers.
This held the weapon fast. It was dis
charged, and the bullet entered his ab
domen. *â ; â¢â¢'-Â». , , â¢ ,
Although dangerously wounded and
suffering excruciating pain, Chad
bourne mounted his horse and rode to
the American custom -. house, over a
quarter of a mile from the ranch. Chad
bourne's saddle was drenched with
blood that had flowed from his wound.
He was so weak that he. could scarcely
get out of the saddle. .-> :
Custom House Officer Welsh, Line
Rider Miller and: r Hayhurst â  did what
they could in an unprofessional manner
to stop the flow of blood and ease the
wounded man's sufferings. : A courier
was sent posthaste to: Bisbee, twelve
miles away, for a surgeon. Chadbourne
believed, as did his attendants, that he
would die before the surgeon could ar
rive. Game to the core, he did not
shrink from s death? â¢_ He calmly called
for writing material, made /his will and
gave some final Instructions. â¢ Then he
lighted a cigarette and laid back on
the pillows to wait for death.
The surgeon reached the Custom
house four hours after Chadbourne ar
rived there and ; found .the wounded
man In a very weak condition. From
the nature of the wound the surgeon
believed that: the intestines had been
penetrated and "that death would ."re
sult. , The bullet had lodged In the
right thigh. .The wound was dressed,
and at midnight Chadbourne was
placed on an Improvised stretcher and
put into a wagon, which had been sent
to the Custom-house by the South Bis
bee Copper Mining Company. . The
twelve-mile ride to Bisbee was torture
to Chadbourne. At Bisbee the Copper
Queen Mining Company, which owns
the Arizona arid Southeastern Railroad,
provided a special train to carry Chad
bourne to Benson, Ariz.
The special was connected with the
Pacific limited on the Southern Paclflc,
which arrived yesterday noon. Dr. Bry
ant was at the depot with an ambu
lance to meet the train, and Chad
bourne was taken to the Sisters' Hos
pital. â¢ Bryant made an examination
and found that the -bullet had not
pierced the . intestines, and that the
wound, although extremely painful, Is
not necessarily fatal. . ; V V
Chadbourne, who Is well known in
social circles and a great favorite, lives
with his mother on Allso street. He
Is reported as resting comfortably to
night. â¢ â¢ ' . â â¢â â â â

GILLETT CANNOT

American Officers Balked in an . At

EL PASO, Jan. 21.â A special from
Chihuahua, Mexico, received here this
afternoon, says: Sheriff Joseph Reed
of Wichita, Kans., and F. W. Petty, a
Kansas banker, reached Chihuahua at
midnight last night for the purpose of
taking Grant C. Gillett back to the
United States. Gillett sent for the
American Consul as soon as he learned
that the Sheriff intended taking him
into custody. A consultation was
held, and from all that could be learned
Gillett cannot be taken back against
his will. i â : â â â :>'.-
A. H. Arnold of Kansas City reached
Chihuahua last night, and after a con
sultation with Gillett behind closed
doors, departed for the City of Mexico,
whither, it is supposed, he went to con
fer with President Diaz to endeavor to
effect the surrender of the fugitive:
Charley Hunt returned from Kansas
City on Thursday night and said soon
after his arrival that arrangements
had been made with Gillett's creditors
and that the fugitive would return by
February 11. â 
The new phase assumed in the nego
tiations leads to the belief that some
of the creditors of the Abilene man are
endeavoring to bluff, him into surrend

supposed to have taken with \ him to
Mexico and received since his arrival

STEAMER CAUGHT IN ICE
DRIFTED TILL WRECKED ON IN
TERNATIONAL BRIDGE. c
Nineteen Persons Aboard the Boat
Had a Most; Narrow Escape
From Death in the
River.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUFFALO, .N. V.. Jan. 21.â Locked
in a hu^e ice floe, the Canadian ferry
Niagara, with nineteen persons on
board, was swept hopelessly down the
Niagara River to-night and dismantled
by the international bridge. The boat,
which plies between this city and Erie,
Ont, left her dock near the mouth of
the river in the early evening, on her
last trip of the day, having on board
fifteen passengers, six of whom were
women and two children. Her crew
consisted of four men. The river was
full of floating ice. that was drifting in
from Lake Erie, but the boat, heading
diagonally against the current, made
her way to the center of the stream.
Here she became imbedded in a great
field of ice and her engines were power
less to propel her. The current at this
point is exceedingly swift and the mo
mentum of the ice field carried the
ferry with it.
The passengers, realizing their situa
tion, were horror-stricken with the fear
of being carried over, the falls, and the
more imminent danger of being dashed
against a pier* of the international
bridge. The calls of the ferry whistle
attracted attention from the shore, and
fire tugs were started out a mile above
to rescue the helpless craft. /
The passengers and crew 'of the
Niagara put on life-preservers and
stood with blanched faces while the
boat swept onward. River navigation
being closed, the draws of the bridge
are inoperative and the draw engines
dead. It was evident that the upper
works of the boat could not clear the
span, but the great menace was the
piers of solid masonry.
The current favored the boat and
swept her between the span, a little to

NEW WITNESSES
IN THE SUISUN
MURDER CASE
Two Persons Who Will Destroy
the Alibi Creation of Miller's
Attorneys.
d SUISUN, Jan. 21.â The prose- Â©
tt cution is preparing to throw a Â© j
tt bombshell Into the camp. of the Â©
tt defendants in the Wilson mur- Â©
tt der case at the preliminary ex- Â©
tt amlnatlon I next Tuesday morn- Â©
tt Ing, and unless all signs fail the Â©
tt effect will be disastrous to the Â©
tt hopes of W. J. Miller and his al- Â©
2 leged accomplices. The surprise Â©
tt in store for the suspected trio is Â©
tt in the nature of newly dlscov- Â©
tt ered witnesses, and the import- Â©
tt ance of the testimony they are Â©
5 expected to. give can be vaguely Â© |
Vi surmised from the extraordinary Â© I
tt efforts that are being made by. Â© j
tt the authorities to prevent their Â©
tt names and present whereabouts Â© '
tt becoming public. Â©
Neither will they vouchsafe any in
formation regarding the testimony
these witnesses are- expected to give,
further than to say that there is no
longer the slightest reason to doubt
the guilt of the accused persons. Un
ler Sheriff Robinson, who, in the ab
sence of Sheriff Savage, has been
rounding up witnesses, is highly elated
it the latest developments in the case.
While he, as well as all the officers em
ployed in the case, have persistently
ieclared they were in possession of suf
ficient evidence to . hold Miller, Mrs.
Dickinson and Mrs. Wilson for trial be
fore the Superior Court, the alleged
willingness of the Shean girls of Vall
?jo to go on the stand and swear that :
hey saw Miller at his home in that city !
_n the night and at the hour the mur- ]
ier was committed has caused many j
10 fear that, whether their testimony ;
was. true or false, it might seriously j
prejudice the case in favor of the de
fendants.
Now all fears on that score have been j
set at rest. Two witnesses will be
Placed on the stand next Tuesday who
ire expected to swear that Miller could
not have been in Vallejo at the time
ihe Sheans say he was. One of these
.Witnesses the authorities have been on
ihe track of for some time past and
lave just succeeded in locating. She
s said to have told several intimate
friends that Miller passed her house on
the Suisun road at about 7 o'clock on
the evening of the murder, driving a
Dlack horse and heading in the direc
ion of the Wilson ranch, which is but a
few miles away.. At the time the young
woman was a resident of Cordelia, but
she removed from that village some
:ime ago. She has sought to avoid tes
tifying in court through a natural re
uctance to being mixed up in the affair,
but yesterday she was served with a
subpena and will be present at the
hearing, prepared to tell all she knows
about the case.
The other witness was not located
until this afternoon. His testlmonv is
regarded as more important than, that

man, whose identity is being withheld
for obvious reasons, is said to nave
confided to an intimate acquaintance,
who is willing to vouch for the trutn
of the statement, that he -saw. Miller
on the Wilson ranch within a short
time of the assassination. This man
was personally acquainted with Miller
and his evidence when given under
oath on the witness stand will knock
the alibi completely from under the
defense of the chief figure in the trial
and effectually combat the evidence of
the Sheans, on which Miller so confi
dently counts to prove his innocence.
This witness has not yet been served
with a subpena. but Under Sheriff
Robinson says he will have the man
present to testify when needed, lne
efforts of certain persons who for some
unexplained reason have been seeming
to weaken the evidence gathered by
the prosecution and bolster up the fail
ing courage of the accused are in tne
main responsible for the refusal of tne
officers to disclose the identity of tnese
new witnesses. _ "âÂ«-_,
The serious illness of Sheriff Savage
will in no way interfere with the plan
to hold the preliminary examination at
the time stated. The Sheriff's sudden
collapse came at a most inopportune
time, as he is in possession of certain
facts which have an important bearing
on the case and with which he alone
is familiar, but while District Attorney
Devlin would be glad to have the bene
fit of the Sheriff's information, it is no
longer regarded as essential to making
the case against Miller and his asso
ciates sufficiently strong to insure their
being held for trial.
Mrs. Dickinson took a wonderful
brace this afternoon, after a long inter
view with her attorney, who is said to
have assured her that the term of her
confinement in the County Jail was
nearing a close and that she undoubt
edly would be discharged from custody
at the preliminary examination.
This assurance, while possibly satis
fying to Mrs. Dickinson, is of little
value, - inasmuch as Attorney Lamont
has nothing to base his judgment of the
weight of the evidence on, further than
such facts as have .been given publicity
in the newspapers since the arrest of
the suspected trio.
But the evidence given out for publi
cation is very meagre compared with
the incriminating facts that are in pos
session of the prosecution. So far as
known the prisoners have practically
no defense other than their own denials
of. the charges and the flimsy alibi
which the Sheans are expected to swear
to. It is evidently the hope of the at
torneys for the defense that the pros
ecution will be unable to present a per
fect chain of circumstantial evidence
and that the testimony of its witnesses
will fall to the ground under the fire
of a vigorous cross-examination. Pres
ent indications are , that they are
doomed to bitter disappointment.WINE MEN ARE

California's Vinous Products Are
b Compelled to Pay a Prohibitive
Hopes of Securing
a Reduction.
: The wine men of California are much
â¢concerned over the deliberations of
.the Canadian-American Commission re
â¢ gardlng reciprocity between the two
countries. Canada and British Columbia
' are large consumers of dry and sweet
wines, as well as champagnes, and by
'â¢reason of the existing Canadian tariff
â¢ the California products are practically
' 'shut out of the markets of these northern
' neighbors. â¢"â  -.â -; -
_t is understood that about the only
product of this coast that is securing any
consideration from the American Com
missioners is lumber, and this is due
principally to the Interests of the lumber
producing States of the East. There is
no one in Washington to set forth the
claims and rights of the great wine In
dustry of this State, and for this reason
there is considerable anxiety as to what
will be done for American viticulture.
For some reason the treaty with Can
ada places a tariff of one shilling per gal
lon and 20 per cent ad valorem on wines
produced In the United States, while the
wines of France, are admitted to that
. country free of duty. if the proper rep
resentations were made it is confidently
believed that American wines could be
. afforded the same favor as the French In
tho readjustment of the reciprocity
schedules. In view of the fact that the
people of Canada and British Columbia
are more generous consumers of wines
according to population than Americans
it is natural that the producers of this
country should be desirous to get their
prodi.cts into those markets on an even
basis with their competitors.
The substantial demand that has been
created in those countries, notwithstand
ing the handicap of an almost prohibi
tive tariff, shows that under favorable
â¢ conditions a large, profitable and growing
'export trade could be established.
â¢Whether or not this advantage will be se
cured' depends almost wholly on the
â¢prompt action of those most vitally Inter
- ested. As there is no one in Washington
..familiar with the situation who can intel
ligently explain the case to the Commis
sioners the wine merchants . and pro
v ducers have decided that their only re
course is to shake up the California dele
â¢ gatlon by means of letters setting forth
their claims in the premises. This cru
sade has been inaugurated and it is ear- I
:nestly hoped that it .will result in victory.
'.'One of the prominent wine men who '
â¢has taken up the cudgel in behalf of the
â¢industry is C. J. Wetmore, president of
,;the YV etmore-Bowen Company. In a re- I
cent letter to Senator Perkins he called
â that gentleman's attention to tl>e existing
â¢unfair conditions of the Canadian-Ameri- '
can commercial treaty and asked that thn I
fact? be, set properly before the commls- ;

: ."Dear sir: I thank you very much for i

ALL HANGS ON THE \
ONE-TWELFTH ACT
THE SCHOOL BOARD INJUNC
TION SUITS SUBMITTED.
Argument Centered on the Validity
and Effect of a Statute Limit
ing the Expenditures of
Public Moneys.
Whether teachers will first be paid from
I the moneys remaining in the hands of the
! School Board or the demands of the mer
chants, contractors, laborers and other
creditors will be honored will probably be
decided by Judge Seawell next Friday.
The Injunction suits of Ellsha Brooks, a
teacher, to prohibit the auditing and pay
ment of merchants' demands and that of
Oscar Moses, a merchant, to prohibit the
j recognition of the demands of the teach
ers, were argued before Judge Seawell
yesterday and submitted. John Garber,
Olney & Olney and, Harry T. Creswell
represented the teachers, while the inter
ests of the other creo.tors were prose
cuted by Frank Powers, Joseph L. Robl
son and Attorney v_ushlng.
A summing up of the argument ad
; vanced by the various lawyers shows that
I it dwells on one pointâ tne effect of what
is known as the "one-twelfth act." - This
I act provides that It shall not be lawful
hereafter for the Board of Supervisors of
the city and county of San -"'rancisco, or
any committee, officer or board having
power to authorize or contract liabilities
against the treasury of said city and
county, to authorize, allow, contract for,
pay, or render- payable. In the present or
future. in any-one month any demand or
demands against said treasury*, or any of
the funds thereof, which shall in the
aggregate exceed one-twelfth part of the
I amount allowed by laws existing at the
time of such contract, authorization, al
lowance, payment or liability, to be ex
pended within the fiscal year of which
said month is a part.
If at the beginning of any* month any
money remains unexpended In any of the
; funds set apart for maintaining the
municipal government of the city and
county of San Francisco, and -which
i might lawfully have been expended the
i preceding month, such unexpended sum
! or sums may be carried forward and ex
pended by order of the Board of Super
visors, in any succeeding- month.
It Is Contended on behalf of the teach
ers that the combined demands of mer
chants and teachers will exceed the sum
j allowed to be expended under this act,
! and in such event the teachers have the
prior claim by reason of a contract in ad
vance for the $85,000 per month allowed by
I law. To this the attorneys for the mer
chants argued that the "one-twelfth act"
could not apply to the case at bar, as
those provisions contained In relation to
the School Board had oeen repealed by
the constitution and statutory enactment
providing that the schools should be kept
open : at least eight months in the year.
The repeal alleged by the merchants' at
torneys ls one of implication and Judge
Garber contended that there could be no
repeal by Implication If the acts could
stand together so as to be operative. The
enactment known as "the one-twelfth
act" was passed for reasons of public
j policy, Mr. Garber held, and as an act to
prevent the waste of public moneys ap
plied to the Board of Education as well as
other bodies handling and disbursing pub
lic funds.
The final argument was made by Attor
neys Robison and Cushing, who contend
ed that as lt is at present the middle of
i the fiscal year demands on proper con
tracts could not be put aside. Again, the
, attorneys contended that all laws should
have' a uniform operation and as subse-
I quent legislation had rendered the "one
twelfth act" inoperative it should not be
â  considered by the court In Its final Judg
! ment. Judge Seawell tnen took the mat
| ter under advisement.

Oceanic Company Is
Progressive.
KNOWS ITS DEFICIENCIES
PREPARES TO HANDLE THE IN
CREASED COMMERCE.
President Spreckels Advises the
Purchase at Once of Three
Seventeen-Knot 6000-ton
Steamers.
The rapid growth of the commerce of
this city ls demonstrated In ! the annual
report of President John D. Spreckels of
the Oceanic Steamship Company, in
which he urges the directorate of the
company to order at once two or three
steamships of about 6000 tons register and
seventeen knots speed to meet the re
quirements of the trade. He also shows
how the traffic has entirely outgrown the
present capacity of the company to han
dle it.
Thousands of tons of cargo have-been
lost to the company after having been
vainly tendered for transportation, ulti
mately finding" Its way across the south
ern seas to the far away colonies either
by Canadian Pacific steamers or by sail
ing vessels. The report also dwells on
the mall service. At present English
malls leaving London are landed in Syd
ney, by way of the Suez canal, in an
average of thirty-four days; by way of
San Francisco, In thirty-seven days, and
Vancouver, forty days. With Improved
service from this city the time should be
shortened to thirty days.
With seventeen-knot vessels the time to
and from Honolulu could be cut down
to five days and four hours. The re
mainder of the voyage to and from the
colonies could be covered at a rate of
speed that would average fifteen knots
for the entire trip. . ...w. ;.':
President Spreckels declares that It is
imperative that orders for steamers be
placed at the earliest possible moment. It
is expected that the Hanna-Payne ship
ping bill will have a beneficial effect, If
adopted, as Is expected. The subsidy pro
visions are so liberal that it ls believed
the increased demands* upon the ship
yards will be far beyond their capacity.
' One Illustration of the effects of the pro
posed bill is here given: "The present
subsidy of the company per voyage is
$10,769; under the new bill the same ves
sels would receive (10,478, while a steamer
of 6000 tons register and seventeen knots
speed would receive $21,136." â¢ ,
The report closes with a prediction that
the Paris Exposition in 1900 and the Pa
cific Ocean Exposition In 1901 will have a
material effect upon the commerce of this
coast.
The steamers Mariposa and Alameda
of the Oceanic Company are to be thor
oughly overhauled. The engines will be
altered from compound to triple expan
sion, and new boilers will take' the place
of those now ln use. This will mean a
gain of about 500 horse-power and of one
knot in speed. It will also enlarge the
cargo capacity by 367 tons, and materially
reduce the consumption of fuel. The ma
chinery and boilers will be ready for in
stallation in July, and each vessel will in
turn be withdrawn from service; for a
period of ninety days. At the same time
It' ls proposed to renovate the passenger
accommodations at a cost of $50,000.
Seven directors were elected at the an
nual meeting yesterday. They were:
Claus Spreckels, John D. Spreckels,
Adolph B. Spreckels. Thomas B. Phebv,

well as enjoyable affairs given In this
city, and society looks forward to them
with keenest delight. The committees
having the affair in charge are composed
of the most prominent people ln town -and
tickets are only. Issued after approval by
a committee, which Insures an exclusive
attendance. Ladles are obliged to don
masks to secure the liberty of the ball
room floor and all are requested to wear
fancy costumes. This request has been
generally observed in the past with the
result that the dressing has been surpris
ingly rich and artistic; but this year it Is
expected the ladles will outdo themselves
in this respect. The price of tickets has
been fixed at $5 for gentlemen and $3 for
ladles, the proceeds to be. devoted to the
art association.

The Recent Storm Alarmed the Own-

Sausalito.
At a meeting of the directors and stock
holders of the Enclnal .Yacht Club, held
recently to discuss. the course to be pur
sued with regard to the loss of the annex
and . its contents by fire, It was decided
to apply the money collected from the
Insurance companies to the reduction of
the indebtedness now taken up by some
of the members, and to defraying the cost
of -certain proposed improvements. The
boat house will be enlarged and the bowl
ing alley built alongside it; the bath
houses and plank walks will be | restored,
but the annex in Its original form will
not be reconstructed. Work will shortly
be begun on the club buildings.
A meeting of the officers of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club was held last week In
the office of J. R. Wilson In the Mac

financial position of the club was dis
cussed. R. L. Eanies, who had been elect

The recent southeasterly gale at Sau
salito washed away- portions of the sea
wall and of the roadway In front of the
San Francisco Yacht Club house, but did
not carry away the float, as has been
stated, for that had been taken high up
on the beach some weeks ago by Lang,
the club boat keeper. - v ="
Dr. A. W. McKenzie's launch Alberta
and . the yawl Ripple were moored in
Rlchardsons Bay. The yawl broke from
her moorings, collided with the * launch
and smashed some of Its window^ and
did other damage. The launch Alberta
Is now on the beach at Smith's new boat
building yard in Hurricane Gulch and will
be put into thorough repair. The Suth
erland brothers' sloop Catherine was
hauled high up on the beach at Old Sau
salito, but the waves driven by the storm
came up far enough to knock her rudder
off. The owners of pleasure boats for
hire at Sausalito take them out of the
water during the winter and put them. in
vacant lots out of harm's way.
The nominating committee of the San
Francisco Yacht Club, consisting of ex-

Annual Meeting of the San Francisco
Kennel Club and Election of
Officers.
The Pacific Coast special committee of
the American Kennel Club has received
from the club secretary in New York the
announcement that the resolutions passed
at the last meeting of the committee have
been received by the club with approval.
The committee in Its resolutions depre
cated drastic action in the matter of the
three California members of the A. K. C.
that had affiliated, themselves with a local
organization, and declared itself unalter
ably opposed to their expulsion from the
A. K. C. Later developments are proving
the wisdom of this course, as the offend
ing clubs will probably be dropped for
non-payment of dues. The desired end
will thus be attained without the Inau
guration of an annoying and possibly pro
tracted Imbroglio.
The Pacific Mastiff Club held Its month
ly meeting last evening in the Phelan
building. The December meeting was
omitted, owing to the illness of the secre
tary of the club.
The annual meeting of the San Fran
cisco Kennel Club takes place next week.
The election of officers and of a new board
of directors will be held, a judge selected
for the spring show and a bench show
committee appointed. As the St. Bernard
Club of California will co-operate with
the Kennel Club this year, the prospects
are in favor of an unprecedehtedly largo
show. - y y.y 'â 'â â  -'Y/yyyyy^

A CHARGE.

> -
At the dinner tendered to Major General
William R. Shatter by .the Union League
Club at the Palace Hotel last evening the
gallant conqueror of Santiago de Cuba
told in simple words a few stories of the
famous fight. His remarks were In a
measure a reply to the address of State
Senator John F. Davis, welcoming the
general back to. California. . General
Shafter began by stating that next Oc
tober he would go : on the retired list and
would make his permanent home in this
State. His remarks in part were' as fol
lows: :y-yr >f.
"Relative to my work In Cuba, I sim
ply did what I was required to do and,
while the orders to me were; changed a
number of times, I was fortunate In be
ing able to carry them out successfully.
I was first sent to Tampa to prepare and
lead a recognizance in force Into Cuba
for the purpose of finding General Go
mez; to learn the number of his men and
to supply his wants, etc. I was to land at
Marieta, a little port about thirty .'miles
east of Havana, with. 25,000 men. On June
- 1 was called to, the telephone and or- j
dered to go to Santiago de Cuba Instead. |
A few days later I was told over the tel
ephone wire from Washington that a por
tion' of the Spanish fleet had been seen (
to the north of Cuba and 1 was directed i
to stay where I was. Five days afterward j
I was told that Cervera was bottled up in j
Santiago harbor and could be captured.
"I crowded my transports with about I
17,000 troops, and. was soon looking for a J
landing place to the eastward of the |
city ot Santiago. I knew /from several i
little towns in that locality roads could j
be found running to that point.
At the "same time I took in considera- !
tion the health of my troops. I have had
yellow fever myself, and _ knew that in
a tew days that army would be stricken.
So it was 'rush, rush' always. Then we
landed and began to fight; and one of the i
best tributes to our hghters came from ,'
the Spanish themselves. "
"They told their officers that they stood |
and fired on the Americans as they j
charged into the intrenchments, and that i
they hit them and killed them, but that ,
they still kept coming. I knew this char
acteristic of our soldiers, and when I or- I
dered an advance if they got well started
I did not attempt to recall them, because
nothing can stop an, American soldier
when on a charge. He won't come back
till he is beaten or killed.
"There is another thing I want to men
tion. Not many rounds of ammunition |
were thrown away. Our troops' to-day i
are marksmen; and when a gun was fired j
In the battle of Santiago de Cuba It gen
erally found Its target. All of my direc- |
tions on this subject were for Individual
firing: The Spaniards tired: in companies i
and regiments, and. while out of the great \
mass of bullets some did execution, thou- ;
sands and thousands only hit the grass I
and trees. I cannot' understand why the i
Spanish did not make a better or at least j
a longer defense. â¢ If our army had been i
In their positions 50,000 men could not have I
dislodged them,
"Now In regard to the incorrect report !
that I. lntended to fall back and" wait for j
reinforcements. Remember, I had 14,000 \
troops stretched out on a line of ten miles, *
between 21,000 Spanish soldiers and. the |
city. At 8 o'clock on the evening of July
1 1 called a council of division command- I
ers, and, after consultation, I said in these
words, 'We'll stay where we are." And ;
we did stay. There, was never a step
taken; there was never a thought of re
tiring from our positions. I did try to j
recall Lawton from the attack on ,El
Caney, believing that we could use his I
troops to better advantage before San
tiago, but his gallant men had got started |
and could not be stopped till they had
taken the town. â 
"That night I called on Toral to sur
render, which he u-d. as you know. I |
tried to have Garcia keep back Pando
with his reinforcements, but the.Cubans
were always too slow. However, it was
all right in the end, for we took Toral and
Pando toireuier. '
"While talking with Toral regarding the
number, of troops he had to surrender he
mentioned thousands stationed In the
neighboring towns, nnd inquired if I |
asked for their surrender also. Here was .
many more troops than I was bargaining
for, but I thought a bold bluff was In-or- j
der and told him emphatically 'all.' So |
we got all of them. ' "_ -
"The only anxious moment I had was
after I had sent Lawton to attack EI I
Caney. I thought I had thus weakened ;
my lines and made a mistake, but the po- i
sition was gallantly carried and it was all j
right." *- â¢ .v'.y^ :

DEATH. OF. JOHN T. GRAHAM.
A Patriotic and Public-Spirited ; Citi
â  zen Passes -Suddenly Away.
Death has laid claim to John T. Gra
; ham, one; of the original settlers 'of Pre
' clta Valley and also the one above all
' others - who had - been instrumental in
building up the prosperity of the valley.
He was the pioneer of, that. section of the
bed of Mission. Creek at the base of Ber
nal Heights, and labored most assiduous
-1 ly to have: the place Improved. .;. In this
he was ;: successful ' .as the - waste valley
has " been partially j proclaimed and - made
habitableâ so much so that it is now quite
a. settlement in Itself. ; One of the first
things done by him was to organize, an
improvement club, and by constant: agi
tation with 'the - Supervisors obtain: ap
propriations for : the. .improvement of the
section. including the laying out of Bernal
Park, which he had .hoped to see carried
to a finality: but, alas! .claimed him
before the park was finished. y
Graham was .a man of generous nature,
i open-hearted .to his friends ' and patriotic
:to the land of his adoption. When quite
; a boy he enlisted in the Union army and
I fought -under : the flag until the close of
; the Civil "War. ..'->; y -
He was an -active. member of James A;'
â -. Garfield Post, G. A. R.. ~ and during his
lifetime did much for. the organization.
In recognition of those good acts, the post
will - pay its 'last tribute of respect to his
memory J to-day '- by attending ' his ". funeral
from' Albion Hall. Alcazar** building. His
remains will be interred -in the -National
Cemetery at the Presidio. , The deceased
was born in Staffordshire. England, sixty
eight years ago. Previous to the. last
election â . he was ' favorably mentioned as
the Republican nominee for Supervisor of
the Eleventh Ward, but withdrew^ at the
request of his friends. Iff- â¢ - {

JEFFRIES AND FITZSIMMONS.
Billy Delaney and His Charge. Will
Leave To-Day for New York, Ex
yy^: pecting Big Money.
Billy Delaney, the manager of big Jim
Jeffries, received an offer from a New
York sporting club yesterday which De
laney has accepted.
The first' dispatch Manager Billy re
ceived was: "Come to New York right
away with Jeffries, as he can be matched
to fight Bob Fitzsimmons as soon as he
arrives." '-- *'
Delaney . replied that Jeffries was al
ready matched to fight Joe Kennedy a
twenty-round contest In February before
the National Club, and asked his Eastern
friendâ evidently Tom O'Rourkeâ to post
pone the Fitzsimmons proposed contest
until after he had finished with Kennedy.
But in answer to this Delaney was wired
another dispatch, which read: "Leave
Frisco right away, or your chance with
the big fellow is off."
This last message caused Delaney to
change- his mind about the Kennedy con
test, and he notified the managers of the
National Club that they could count upon
the Kennedy-Jeffries fight as being off. as
he (Delaney) would leave Oakland to-mor
row with Jeffries for New York.'
The National Club felt very much cha
grined over the affair, which they consid
ered rather shabby, treatment on the part
of Delaney, but instead of . the big guns
they .intend now to match either Jack
Bonnerâ Is on his way West or
Tommy Ryan to fight George Green in
February. ;'..'â  r y y'-~' i'-.t
'TWAS A LOVING CUP.
A Pleasing Surprise to the Retiring
Regent of Sequoia Chapter,
D. of the A. R.
1 The last held meeting of Sequoia Chap
; ter of the Daughters of the American
Revolution in its rooms in the Sorosls
| Clubhouse was one of more than usual in
; terest, being marked by the presentation
on behalf of the members of a loving cup
to Mrs. A. S. Hubbard, through whose un
tiring efforts the chapter sprang into ex
istence and of which she has been the
regent and the registrar. The cup ls of
cut crystal, nine Inches high, silver bound
and rested on a sliver mounted mirror.
On the silver rim -there is an inscription
conveying the sentiments of the chapter
to the recipient. The presentation address
; was made by Mrs. George Law Smith, and
was a most flattering tribute, well de
served, for the untiring efforts of the re
tiring regent, who, as founder of tho So
ciety of Daughters of the Revolution on
this coast, as honorary regent. State re
| gent," registrar and chapter regent.- for
seven years guarded the interests of Se
quoia. Chapter. . f'Y^Ysyy^ y:
The presentation had the element of a
complete surprise, for the ladies kept the
affair, a secret, and so unexpected was the
I gift that the recipient was for a time at
I a loss to express her feelings, but after a
; time managed to return thanks â¢to the
1 members for the loving cup of affection,
; and uttered the hope that the cup when
I filled and passed from hand to hand, each
I lip touching the rim, might impart to it
I some virtue, so that when the last one had
; tasted and it was passed around again
i all might be united in spirit and in truth.

WALES' PHYSICIAN
ON CONSUMPTION
Sir William Broadbent Says Consump
tion Is Contagions and Curable
. . Not Necessarily Hereditary.
AGREES WITH SLOCUM METHODS
At a Meeting in London the Prince of Wales'
;' * Physician Fully Confirms Dr. Slocum's
yy Teachings on This Disease.
LONDON, Jan. 17.â meeting of the
National Society for the Prevention of
Consumption and other forms of Tuber
cular diseases, held at Marlborough
House December 20, was presided over
by the Prince of Wales, and addressed
Lord Salisbury and Sir William
Broadbent, physician to the Prince of
Wales. ..ff-':f' : f.
: Dr. -Broadbent adheres to the view
that, consumption is not necessarily
hereditary, but a contagious disease,
and is.'therefore curable by a treatment
which will destroy the germs and build
up the system.
He thus agrees with Dr. Slocum in
every, particular and his address is a
practical indorsement of the system of
treatment followed out so successfully
by this well-known practitioner.
Dr. Slocum felt sure, when he first
announced his theory, based on scien
tific experiments and practice, that con
sumption is a germ 'disease and not ne
cessarily, a hereditary .taint, that the
whole medical, world would in time ac
knowledge that he was right.
â¢ In Sir William Broadbent Dr. Slocum
has an ally who will be of great assist
ance in teaching the people the real
nature of consumption, : its prevention
and its cure/ 'yf-% f^y
The first thing necessary, as these
two great physicians, show, Is the kill
ing, of the germs efbthe diseaseâ and
then the strengthening and building up
of the system. y*.
This is just the theory-' upon which
the . Dry Slocum New Treatment for
Consumption, -Lung Weakness and the
Grip is based/: The. germs of consump
tion, grip,' etc., enter the body through
the nose and mouth in breathing, and
pass down the respiratory canal to the
lungs. .
Dr. Slocum's medicines disinf-oct the
system from the nostrils to the deepest
passages of the lungs, both by contact
with the mucous membrane and
through the blood, thus killing the
germs. His medicines also furnish food
with which to build up the wasted
tissues, and fortify the system against
renewed attacks of the terrible mi
crobes. 'â :'â ?â â ' y
It was announced at this meeting in
London, referred to above, that Wern
her & Beit, the South African finan
ciers and diamond mine owners, had
given $100,000 for the erection of a Sani
tarium for Consumption.
The thousands of Americans who are
using this famous system, and the
thousands who have been cured by it.
will be interested in the fact that the
scientific principles embodied in the Dr.
Slocum's New System of Treatment
have been so highly indorsed by Sir
William Broadbent, the eminent physi
cian to the royal family. â¢ * â  .
Dr. Slocum's offer to send free medi
cine to sufferers from these dreadful
germ diseases has at last borne fruit,
and others are beginning to join with
him in the work of ridding the world of
its greatest and ' most ' dangerous
scourge. Â»
He will still continue the distribution
of the three free bottles comprising the
complete course of his new system of
treatment so universally known as a
positive cure for all diseases of throat
and lungs. '
Every reader of The Call who has
consumption, grip, weak lungs, catarrh
or any form of lung or throat or bron
chial weakness, or any wasting chronic
complaint, who sends name and full ad
dress to or calls at The Doctor Slocum
American Laboratories, 96 and 98 Pine
street. New York City, stating that he
read this article in the San Francisco
Call will receive these three free bottles
with full instructions for self treatment
and free advice adapted to any case.

LOCATED
In a rented house, paying $15 or $20 rent the
first of every month, you are certainly not
getting your moneys worth; in a Heyman
tract home, comfortable and cozy, paying for
it with exactly the same $15 or $20 per month,
you get your moneys worth, and more too.
An investment in one of these homes is a
savings bank that gives you ln a few years
all the money that you would have thrown
away ln rents, and from the time you start
in to pay the home is always yours; over 100
homes in the Heyman tract now being paid
for. JACOB HEYMAN & SON, 11 Mont-

WINTER TRAVEL
IS MADE EASY
Plenty of Road Houses
on Dawson Trails.
TO CARRY FOOD UNNECESSARY
BUT IT IS DIFFERENT ON THE
WAY TO ATLIN.
Many People Stampede to the New
Diggings When It Would Be as
Profitable and More Com
"-". fortable at Home.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Calk
JUNEAU, ALASKA; Jan. 21 (via
Seattle, Wash., Jan. 19).â A1l north and
south bound ships have been hunting
for cover in Lynn Canal for the past
three days on account of furious winds
and snow storms. Lynn Canal is full
of rocks, so they would not take
chances ln the night or in the daytime
when it was too thick to see more than
a ship's length ahead. For instance,
the steamship Al-Ki was forty-eight
hours making Skaguay from Juneau, a
distance of about 100 miles. The gale
nearly blew the masthead light out of
the rigging. Storms on Alaskan wa
ters seem to turn the elements of
earth, air and water into a tumbling
chaos. I was once favored with being
strapped to the bridge, and it was a
wonder to me that the ship was not
beaten beneath the waves.
Nearly every day people are coming
out at Skaguay and Juneau from the in
side, the Inside meaning Dawson and
extreme Yukon Basin. The road
houses in the snow making traveling
very easy as compared with last win
ter's trail. It is now quite possible for
a hardy and adventurous man to leave
Dawson without a pound of grub and
reach tidewater all right, depending on
the roadhouses for his supplies. It
would be safer, however, for him to
take along a few pounds of dried fish
for the dogs and himself in case of
being unexpectedly snowbound between
posts.
With a decent regard for facts, it is
about the same story from Dawson
that it was thirty days ago when the
first-comers arrived out. There is an
occasional stampede without results
other than disappointing. The popu
lation of Circle City has increased con
siderably by an overflow from Dawson
and the great Yukon River has now
gone into its long winter sleep through
its entire length.
Atlin Lake also went asleep early
this month and it remains unruffled by
the winds except as they whirl the
drifting snow. John Doe, that great
anonymous standby of the courts, is at
last dead. He died last week in Lake
Atlin, Alaska, and the courts will have
to hunt for another assumed name to
apply to unknown persons. A man
actually bearing that name went out
on- the ice from Atlin City to test its
strength. He and his companion,
whose name was not Richard Roe,
broke through and John Doe was
drowned. Where he came from is not
known.
Jack Russell of Juneau has a good
Atlin story- He says he helped carry
eighty-three sacks of dirt down to the
sluice box a few days r-^ on Captain
Sperry's claim on Pine Creek, and that
$259 60 was worked out of it. Jack
Barnes, also of Juneau, estimates that
Atlin will be a good twenty-dollar
camp, meaning by that, at least $20 per
day to the man, with an area of coun
try thirty-five miles around Atlin City
as' yet hardly prospected.
That is now supposed to be the area
of the gold deposits. No valuable gold
discoveries have yet been made out
side that district. About fifty men per
day are now arriving at Atlin over the
ice and the cut-off trail from Log Cabin
on the Skaguay trail. It is tough
traveling. People would tough
ellng. People would wait till
March or April if they knew before
hand what they would have to. face.
Otter Lake, about twelve miles long,
which must be crossed, has twelve
inches of water on top of the ice, mixed
with snow. The mall carrier's dogs,
after making the last trip across the
lake, were frozen to death. They were
thoroughly soaked and chilled, and the
mail carrier did not give them proper
care. Some real estate is already
changing hands at Atlin City. The
rush to Atlin might as well be post
poned till spring, as nothing can be
done now in the way of mining and
prospecting, but new-comers cannot be
made to see lt that way. If advice to
that effect is given, a stranger he sus
pects that an attempt is being made
to sidetrack him. Conseauently he
goes in, sits around and does nothing
and eats up his grub till spring, when
he could stay in the States or in
Alaska coast towns with much more
comfort and no more expense. All
north-bound ships arriving here and at
Skaguay are crowded.
Frank Gray, representing Victoria
and Vancouver parties who built
steamers for the Stickeen River which
were never used, is here and about to
take a trip up the Taku with a view to
putting the stern-wheelers on that
river In connection with the Taku trail
from Juneau. This trail will probably
become popular before the season is
over. It is no longer than the White

A letter has been received here from
the Department of Agriculture asking
for specifications for a building at Sitka
able for the accommodation of an
agricultural agent and a signal of
ficer, to be erected at an expense not
to exceed $4500. This is the first visible
sign anywhere that the Government
has serious intentions of developing the
agricultural resources of Alaska, the
possibilities of which, particularly to
the westward? are believed by the ag
ricultural expert who was here last
summer to be great. It Is highly prob
able that within a few- years Alaska
will be raising all the staple vegetables
consumed at home. Results of experi
mental process of curing hay, air-tight
buildings for which were constructed
last summer on Juneau flats, at
Skaguay, Sitka and Cooks Inlets are
most satisfactory. The hay is now be
ing taken out of the buildings here. It
Is still green and nutritious and fattens
the cattle to which it is fed.

WILLIAM NOW
VERY FRUGAL
Inspired Article on the
Kaiser's Finances.
Copyrighted, 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Jan. 21.â Some stir has Jaeen
created by an article in the Grenzboten
on imperial finances by Herr yon Kas
sow, who was apparently inspired from
high quarters. He takes pains to ex
pose the baselessness of the rumors re
flecting upon Emperor William's mon
etary resources. The Grenzboten's
article was prompted more particularly
by recent rumors that his Majesty in
tended to ask the Prussian Landtag for
a vote to defray the expenses of his
Palestine trip, and that he had written,
to Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria
begging for a loan of 12,000,000 gulden.
In view of these reports, implying that
the court finances are embarrassed, it
has been deemed advisable to explain
that the Prussian crown funds are in
a most flourishing condition. Herr yon
Kassow asserts that * although the
maintenance of the imperial dignity of
the navy has necessitated large calls
upon these funds, and while no assist
ance has been received from the Em
peror, yet other factors have placed the
Emperor's finances in a much more fa
vorable position than while of any of
:e has been received from the Em
or, yet other factors have placed the
peror's finances in a much more fa
able position than those of any of
his predecessors. The writer reminds
the public that the Princes of Prussia
do not receive state allowances apart
from their private incomes, and that
they are dependent upon the money
granted them by the King. When Wil
liam I ascended the throne he had to
subsidize the courts of the Dowager
Queen Elizabeth, the Crown Prince
Frederick, Prince Charles, his son;
Prince Frederick Charles, Prince Al
brecht and his son, now the regent of
Brunswick; Prince Frederick and his
two sons and the Princess Niegnitz,
who have all lived in great style. But
now most of those are dependent upon
the present Emperor and either live in
comparative retirement or have inher
ited large properties or bequests which
have placed them beyond need of royal
Herr yon Kassow then proceeds to
compare the expenditure of the pres-
Emperor and of his predecessors
pare the expenditure of the pres-
Emperor and of his predecessors
and concludes:
"The Berlin court, if anything, is too
economical. The Kaiser has expended
little on new buildings, and lives the
greater part of the year at Potsdam on
a scale far less pretentious than a
wealthy commoner. The number of
festivities has been much reduced, and
foreign potentates are not entertained
more frequently than desirable in the
interests of the state."
"In fact," this inspired article con
cludes, "the Kaiser Is regulating his ex
penditure on lines which will \ enable
him to view with equanimity the time
when the six young Princes will require
separate establishments."
Emperor William has turned his at
tention to designing battle statues, and
has commissioned Walter Schott, the
sculptor, to execute a'design by himself
of a monumental figure of a mailed
archangel, ten feet high, resting both
hands on a huge sword, which will be
erected on the battlefield of St. Privat,
facing the French^ frontier.
The chair of military Jurisprudence
has been instituted by the Berlin Uni
versity. This is an indirect result of
the agreement between the Emperor
and the regent of Bavaria on the sub
ject of a supreme military penal court,
which is expected to lead to uniformity
in military law procedure throughout
the empire. Privy Councilor Weiffen
bach has been appointed first professor
of military Jurisprudence.

an, urn, in which a fire beacon will be
kindled on every anniversary of Prince
Bismarck's birthday until the. end of
time. The students are greatly im
pressed ! with the sublimity of the no
tion and have offered a wreath of iron
laurel leaves for the best design for the
column. In addition to twenty-seven
universities, each of which is pledged
to erect its column, forty-seven towns
have declared their intention to co
operate, and it is expected that at
least 200 cities and towns will join in
the movement.
The police officiousness . in invoking
the lese Majeste law received a check
this week. A popular music hall com
edian named Reutter. had been singing
couplets on Emperor William's Orien
tal trip with great success when the
police decided that the Introduction of
his Majesty in a music hall ditty was
tantamount to lese Majeste and ordered
Reutter to stop. The latter, whose
couplets were inspired by patriotism,
questioned the .legality of the police
decree and scored a victory in a.verdict
setting forth that a song treating of
the Emperor^ need not necessarily con
stitute a breach of public morality.
HARD FIGHTING
AT TATTERSALL'S
McKeever and Burns in
a Rattling Go.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. About 4000 men,
two women and Had! Aladi, the "Sul
tan's Lion," saw thirty-one rounds of
exceptionally good fighting at Tatter
sail's to-night, including one clean
knockout. Three Eastern scrappers â
Patsy Haley of Buffalo and Joe Butler
and Charlie McKeever of Philadelphia
âwere among the contestants, but did
not land the long end of the purse, Ha
ley and McKeever getting draws, while
Butler lost on a palpable foul.
The best fight of the evening was
that between Charlie McKeever and
Charlie Burns of Chicago. The men
fought fiercely every minute and Mc-
Keever had the better of the going, but
Burns was so aggressive at the finish
that Referee Malachi Hogan declared it
a draw. They fought at catchweights
and apparently scaled close to 150
pounds. They came together like rams
at the call of time and hot mixups fol
lowed in quick succession, with neither
man damaged much.
The same was true of the second
round. McKeever, in one rally, tripped
and went head over heels off the stage
among the spectators. He climbed
under the ropes and resumed, but a
second later went over from a right
on the jaw. He evened things with a
hard right swing on Burns' chin.
McKeever went to his knees twice in
the third. Both men were rather wild.
In the fourth McKeever took a long
lead. He cut Burns' left eye with labs
and nearly floored him twice with
right swings on the jaw. He main
tained his lead in the fifth. In the
sixth McKeever landed a flush right in
the pit of the stomach. Burns went
down and writhed in agony, claiming
a foul. It was not allowed, and with
his face drawn with pain he got up
and fought like a demon to the end of
the round. It was declared a draw.
Haley of Buffalo and Ritchie of Chi
cago, at catch weights, fought six
rounds to a draw.
Frank Bartley of Binghamton, N.
V., and Homer Selby of Indianapolis,
a brother of "Kid" McCoy, met at 140
pounds. Bartley punished his man
badly in the third and fourth rounds
with left swings on the mouth and in
the fifth and sixth had away the bet
ter of the milling. Bartley was given
the decision. ,
Two local â Pete Powers and I
Jack Moffattâ met at catchweights. j
Moffatt scored a knock-down in the !
first and fourth, finally putting his !
man out in the fifth with a right on
the chin.
John Root, of Chicago, and Harry
Peppers, the colored California middle
middle-weight, fought six rounds at 156
pounds. In the second round Peppers
floored Root with a right on the jaw.
The latter got up from the floor groggy.
Peppers was unable to land the finish
ing blow, and Root, recovering rapidly,
in turn put the colored man down with
a right swing. Peppers was knocked
down four times in the â  third and
fourth and three times in the fifth
round, the gong saving him in the lat
ter round. He managed, though
very groggy, to stick the last round
out. Root was given the decision.
Joe Butler of Philadelphia and Frank
Childs of Chicago, colored heavy
weights, went on for the wind-up. In'
the second round, after several hot ex
changes, Butler lost his head and hit
repeatedly in a clinch. Childs was
promptly awarded the fight.
TO COACH THE CARDINAL.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 21.â
Burr Chamberlain, last year's captain and
tackle of the Yale football team, will
coach the- Stanford eleven this year.
Chamberlain was easily the first man for
the position of tackle on the All-American
team of 1898. He is a kicker of ability,
and this, added to the fact that he has a
knack of blocking plays and opening
holes for the runners on his own side,
has made him famous. "Walter Camp,
the well known football expert, who
coached- here for two years, may assist
Chamberlain and the university team.

BIGGEST MAN IN
GREAT BRITAIN
How English People Run
After Rhodes.
CECIL HAS A LARGE PULL
WILL SECURE MONEY FOR THE
CAPE TO CAIRO RAILROAD.
By Slow Steps, but in Pursuance of a
Definite Plan, England Is Tight
ening Her Grip on
North Africa.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Jan. 21.â Great Britain
seems to shake to its foundations when
ever Cecil Rhodes steps foot on the
island. He is the biggest man in the
kingdom to-day. Peers, Cabinet Min
isters, promoters with Munchausen
schemes, Duchesses craving for tips on
"Kaffirs" or South African securities,
workmen who cherish dreams of emi
gration and bishops solicitous for Afri
can securities, haunt his hotel and beg
even for the briefest interviews, as
though he had already realized his as
piration. The popular mind credits him
with being the potentate of the African
continent.
The Cabinet met yesterday to discuss
Mr. Rhodes' scheme for guarantees of
the Cape to Cairo railroad and tele
graph. Mr. Rhodes afterward con
ferred with Joseph Chamberlain, the
Secretary of State for the Colonies, and
Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, the Chancel
lor of the Exchequer. Mr. Rhodes says
Â£10,000,000 will cover the entire cost of
the work and there is little doubt that
he will carry his point with the Gov
ernment and raise all the money he
needs in the city. Before the projectors
can act in the matte* there will be a
formality in the shape of a Parlia
mentary bill; but the imperialists may
be asked to drive the so-called "Little
Englanders," who are preparing an op
position to the scheme, declaring that
the Rhodeslan empire is making for a
gigantic fiasco and that Mr. Rhodes
wants the Government to lift him out
of a hole by throwing good money after
bad into a railroad through a wilder
ness. They also find a coincidence in
Mr. Rhodes' home-coming and the re
vival of newspaper outbreaks against
the Boers' oppression of British sub
jects in the Transvaal. ' â¢
By slow steps, so as not to arouse
the violent antagonism of the powers,
but in pursuance of a definite Dlan
Great Britain is tightening her srriD on
North Africa. The Egyptian conven
tion, so far as the Soudan is concerned,
accomplishes that which those who
prodded the Marquis of Salisbury to
declare a protectorate could have ex
pected. Great Britain no longer gov
erns through the Khedive. She be
comes a co-equal ruler and ignores the
mixed tribunals. This means that the
governor general is responsible only to
Downing street and .Parliament.
The comment of the Liberte of Paris,
that Great Britain does not annex the
Soudan, she palms it like a sleight-of
hand professor â a specimen of the,
spirit in which France, already in
censed at Great Britain, regards Great
Britain's progress toward absolute
sovereignty in Egypt.
A majority of the London specula
tors handling American stocks have
been badly bitten through pinning their
faith to the prevailing idea that a re
action and a drop in prices must soon
come. This prediction has been fostered
by the financial papers. For Aveeks
they have been declaring that the phe
nomenal advances were artificial and
could not possibly be maintained,
speaking of the "boom" sarcastically,
in such terms as the "American
mania." The result has been that
many professionals have been caught
on the bear side, selling Americans for
a fall which failed to materialize. They
found that the heavy selling of the
Venezuelan and "free silver" periods
had not left enough stocks here to meet
their orders and they were forced to
buy in at advanced prices. Still the
Stock Exchange here adheres to the
opinion that the "boom" will, be over
done, that the ebb will set in in the
natural course of events and that it
cannot be far distant.
The Statist, in a somewhat alarmist
tone, points out that the unprecedented
amount of American capital employed
in Europe, ten or fifteen millions, chief
ly In London and Berlin, may be with
drawn at its owners' pleasure and that
possibly American speculation will be
come so rampant that the owners will
recall their money and invest it there.
The papers fear serious shipments to
New York would send up rates in
Europe. â  ,_
Great Britain presents a vivid con
trast between the potency of civic and
military fame. To put it boldly, Glad
stone dead is quoted at Â£2000 in the
memorial market, while Kitchener alive
easily commands Â£12,000. The pro
moters of the Gladstone memorial, who
expected to secure Â£200,000 to establish
libraries in the principal cities through
popular contributions, are greatly de
pressed at the reports of the appeals
to the people. After several months
these appeals have only resulted in
collecting one-tenth of the sum desired.
But in the case of Kitchener, who
dazzled the empire with the laurels of
a day spent in mowing down thousands
of savages by the perfection of military
discipline and machinery, the British
climb over one another in their eager
ness to pour money into the "college
for blacks," otherwise the Gordon me
morial college at Khartoum, to educate
a people they have never seen, in a
country they never cared for, as a trib
ute to the conqueror. The Gladstone
fund, however, will be made up by
wealthy men, who will gladly give their
money, but who are grievously
chagrined at the lukewarmness of the
people who called him leader and whom
they . expected to contribute spon
taneously.
When the conservative churchmen,
who persisted in shutting their eyes to
the theological controversies, read the
headlines in the Times and Spectator,
"Crisis in the Church of England," they
were compelled to recognize that the
agitation against the "mass and con- I
fessional" started by Konsit and car- j
ried on by Harcourt, had come to a pass
demanding settlement. The Bishops,
being finally driven to grapple with the
problem, met at ; Lambeth Palace this
week and discussed the policy of issu
ing a manifesto. While the deepest
secrecy surrounds the proceedings, it
is said that it has been one of the bit
terest conclaves in the history of the
church, as it certainly was one of the
most Important, j and that it has re
sulted in an agreement to present a bill
to Parliament for a revival of the
church courts. It provides that disputes
must be first brought before the dio
cesan court, j consisting of the Bishop,
assisted by a theological and legal ad
viser. jAn appeal therefrom will be pos
sible to the provincial court, consisting
of the Archbishop and six assessors,
and as a last resort, to five lay Judges,
appointed by the crown. â¢

me In the ordinary way of business,
knowing that I was a printer, and asked
me to do some work for them. They said
that there would be a stated and regular
amount of work each month, and I agreed
to do it at a regular monthly rate of J45.
At the time we closed the bargain I did
not know the nature of the proposed
work, although Johnson, who talked like
a practical printer, told me it would re
quire so much material and so much
labur, and from his statements we were
enabled to agree on a price.
"A few days later Mr. and Mrs. John
son called on me at my home. I was then
living on Fifth street, between Jefferson
and Clay. They brought with them some
packages, and ny surprise was very great
when th. . displayed to me some inks.
paper and cuts, because the latter were
the plates of lottery tickets. -Johnson (or
Upson) evidently understood the busi
ness, for he showed me how to print from
them. They told me their purpose was
perfectly legitimate and that they de
sired to wage war upon the lottery com
panies with agencies in San Francisco.
This they proposed to do, so they told me,
by throwing these tickets about the
streets so they would be found, would be
mixed with genuine lottery tickets, would
create distrust among the public and thus
the companies would be ruined in this
State.
"Although I printed for them for five
years. I did not have any idea that they
were selling the tickets until last" July,
when I immediately quit working for
them, and since then have absolutely
refused to print another bogus lottery
ticket. The work frequently kept me at
the press until the early hours of the
morning, as the process of printing is a
slow one. The tickets were in seven
colors, and as I could only print one color
each day, it was a long Job. I cannot re
member the exact number of tickets* I
printed, but I supplied at least 5000 dupli
cate lottery tickets each month from No
vember, 1593, till June, I*9S. We would
duplicate the Little Original of San Fran
cisco in both 25 cent and $1 tickets. Of
these we printed about 2000 every month.
We also printed original Louisiana tickets
of the 25 cent size to the number of about
1500 monthly and 500 of the dollar tickets.
Our operations, however, were not con
fined to these companies, for we printed
about 1000 Mexican lottery tickets and
the same number of Metzger & Franklin's
Beneficencia Republica of San Francisco
tickets. <-
"in 189. my press broke down, and Mrs.
Johnson, who now appears as plaintiff ln
this case under the name of Miss Bur
dick, went my security for a new press,
which we bought of Palmer & Rey. The
purchase price was $165. I gave my old
press as part payment, borrowed $25 from
Mrs. Johnson and the balance was to be
paid in monthly installments of $10 each.
Twenty days later Mrs. Johnson surprised
me by settling the whole bill at once. Af
ter this Mr. and Mrs. Johnson were not so
regular in their payments, and at present
they owe me over a thousand dollars for
work which I have -done for them and
which has never been paid for.
"Last August I sold my outfit, and the
press Was bought by R. S. Kitchener, a
printer of this city. After that I was em
ployed as advance agent for Hamblin's
Minstrels, and have traveled with ' them
through California, Nevada ana Utah. I
came home about the middle of Novem
ber, and since then Mr. and Mrs. Johnson
have frequently called on me at my home
on Franklin street and have urged me to
go ahead and print for them again. This
1 have positively refused to do, and this
trumped-up charge of embezalement on
account of the printing press is the result.
"On one of their visits to me Johnson
told me that he had never been in San
Quentin in his life but he would take an
oath that he nad power enough to have
me sent to San Quentin or Folsom if I did
not do his work. The last time I refused
to print any more tickets for them was In
December of last year, and I did not hear
from them again until last week, when I
was arrested on a charge of embezzling
the press. The charge was brought by
a Mica Bur-lick, who is none other than
the woman I have all along known as
Mrs. Johnson and whom I identified as
such at my preliminary examination."

HUNTERS OVERDUE
C f . T Tl It i Â£ T
Search Is Made tor wo
Berkeley Boys*
BSRKELET, Jan. 21.â William Seabury and Edward J. Finn, two boys
living in Berkeley, started out early yesterday morning on a duck
hunting trip, expecting to return the same evening. As late as to
night no news of any kind has been received from them, and their
parents have grave fears for their safety.
. ;i The boys are school chums, and both very well known in the uni
versity town. Toung Seabury is the son of Captain William J. Seabury of
the steamer China; his companion Is the son of John Finn of North Berke
ley. Both are just 16 years of age and have been firm friends for a num
ber of years. y.Kjf,-.
The shooting trip on which they started had been planned for days
ahead. j The boat used was a fiat-bottomed scow, made by the. boys
themselves, and known to be perfectly safe. Everything had been made
ready the Thursday evening previous, the scow being tied up at Bath
Beach. West Berkeley, from where the start was to be made the day fol
lowing.
Young Seabury left his home on the corner of Charming way and Dana
street about 4:30 o'clock Friday morning, carrying provisions for just a
day's trip. He walked over to North Berkeley to his companion's house,
on the corner of Shattuck avenue and Berry man street, and tne : two with
their fowling pieces left for Bath Beach at 5 o'clock. It was their inten
tion to skirt the bay shore as far as Ellis, near Point Richmond, watch
ing every opportunity for game. Ellis is about four miles above Stege. and
not far from San Pablo," in Contra Costa County. At most, the two had no
intention of going more than seven miles from Berkeley, and it is this
which gives the parents cause for such serious alarm.
Seabury's friends say that this was his first duck hunt, and that previ
ous to this, while being a fairly .good oarsman, he had had no experience
in handling a gun. His chum, on the contrary, was a good marksman, and
had been on similar expeditions several times before. When seen by a
Call representative to-night, John Finn, father of one of the boys, said
he could not bring himself to think that any fatality had overcome the two.
"San Pablo and the region around there abounds In marshy land and mud
flats," he said, "and it is quite possible that the boat got stuck in some
place where the boys found it impossible to get off. They are doubtless
waiting in some such place until help comes."
Two search parties will leave West Berkeley to-morrow morning in
quest of the missing companions. One will work its way along the shore,
exploring all the creeks and inlets up to San Pablo and beyond. The other
will cut directly across to the Sonoma County shore and search the
marshes opposite San Pablo and Stege, as it is possible that the hoys
may have attempted to go over there in search of better sport. The par
ents of the two have reported the matter to the Sheriff of San Francisco,
who has ordered a watch to be kept along the water front for any traces
of a boat such as the one described.

SAN LEANDRO
RUNNING DEEP

Move to Pay a Fire
Department.
THE SALARY NOT EXCESSIVE

-
Conservative Residents Fear That It
Will Lead to an Unseemly
Scramble for Pat
i ronage.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Jan. 21.
San Leandro's latest ambition is to have
a paid fire department, and it will prob
ably be gratified by the trustees. This
move is considered necessary on account ,
of the locating of a large cannery in that
town, and the prospect that ot.ier estab
lishments will follow.
Trustee Cary has framed an ordinance
which has been submitted to the town
trustees, providing for the fire . depart
ment. An objection has been made that
if the fire department become a paid in
stitution it will undoubtedly exercise an
influence in the politics of the town, as
there will certainly be a scramble for the
patronage. ' â  'â¢:-;' 'â¢â ' , ,
To Oaklanders who have lately been In
formed that WOO wads are used freely in
their midst, in politics, it is very amus- \
ing to note the financial value of the
patronage scramble in the proposed fire
department in San Leandro.
Trustee Carv's ordinance proposes to
pay each member of the department $1 25
per month, or a total of $15 per yeai.
The department is to consist of twenty
members who shall not be under IS, nor
more than 45 years of age. In addition
to this remuneration the firemen shall
receive $1 for each fire which they may
attend. It is expected that at the next
meeting of the board, the ordinance will
become a law. and that the scramble for
those $1 25 places will commence.

OAKLAND. Jan. 21.â Because he did not believe in war and would not *
fight for Uncle Sam, John Ludwig Eneman, a subject of Sweden and *
by occupation a tailor, was denied admission to citizenship by Judge *
Ellsworth yesterday. Five years ago Eneman appeared before the same *
Judge and took out his first papers. Yesterday Eneman again appeared. *
together with his sponsors, George Kullman and Grant Wheeler, to add the Â»
finishing touches to the preliminaries of admission to American citizen- *
ship. â¢ â¢ b *
Eneman passed a remarkably rigid examination, answering intelligent- *
ly all questions touching his qualifications. In short, he exhibited a thor- *
otigh comprehension of Uncle Sam's form of government,. even unto the *
latest modus operandi of selecting a United States Senator. The particu- *
lar point of disqualification, however, consisted of his aversion .to war, *
Which fact was brought out by Judge Ellsworth's final question. The *
court asked: i yf'-r' *
"In the event of a war between the United States and Sweden, would *
you be ready to take up arms against your native land in defense of *
your adopted country?" '. 1 ..-â¢-:â¢ - ; *'
Eneman looked puzzled. It was the first . question that seemed to *
stump him. Regaining his composure, he braced up and responded: *
"Na, sir; ay cannot do dat. Ay vould note faite vid may modder *
country. Because for vay? ,Ah do note balieve in yore anyhow vid eny *
country; boot particler ay vould note raze may arms again" my natlf #

Court Clerk George Pierce noted the Judge's order denying John Lud- *
wig Eneman's application, and his Honor wrote across the applicant's #
first papers, "Citizenship denied." *_.

MADE BIG
PROFITS ON
THE STREET
Mangini Licensed to
Keep a Stand.
HE WAS FORCIBLY EJECTED
KNOTTY POINT FOR THE COURTS
TO DECIDE.
Merchants See in the Suit a Good
Argument in Favor of the
Anti-Stand Ordi
nance.
Oakland Office San" Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 21.
A little paper recently filed with the
City Clerk is proving of considerable in
terest to the merchants and landlords who
are anxious to prevent shops being built
on the sidewalk. The paper is a clam
from Joseph Mangini, who asks that the
city pay him $532 for damages sustained
by forcibly removing his old-time fruit
store at Seventh and Washington streets.
For many years there has been a small
market maintained at this point. In other
parts of the city similar stores have been
'conducted, some of them being fitted out
with mirrors, Ice-cream fountains and
shutters, making them practically the
same as any permanent place of business.
A few months ago the Merchants' Ex
change was largely instrumental in the
passage of an ordinance authorizing the
Street Superintendent to remove all such
obstructions. Mangini was among the
victims.
If his complaint be true, It is a very
profitable business to run a stand on a
street corner. He segregates his bill for
the loss of his stock and his loss of
profits; and for the month of December
he declares that his profits would have
been, judging by precedent, over $200. The
merchants declare that any store making
such profits should not be permitted to
* do business on the sidewalk, but should
carry it on in a legitimate store and be
required to pay its share of taxes.
There is however, another feature to
this case which is being watched with
equal interest. On September 30 Mangini
was granted a license by the city of Oak
land, for whicn he paid the proper fee,
giving him permission to transact his
business. This license did not expire till
December 31. Before he had had his li
cense one month his place of business was
forcibly removed, and his demand on the
city for $532 is, of course, simply the ini
tial proceeding toward bringing suit, un
less the city should decide to pay it,
which it certainly will not.
TIM MAHONEY'S IDEA
. i COST MORAGA MONEY
PERPETUAL MOTION MACHINE
THAT HAS FAILED.
Rancher Suing for His Money, While
the Inventor Was Arrested, as
a Spanish Spy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ 908 Broadway, Jan. 21.
Arcadia and Timothy Mahoney, through
their attorneys, Crowell & Leach, to-day
filed their answer to the suit of Jose G.
Moraga, brought some time ago for the
recovery of $1500 which plaintiff claims
the defendants induced him to part with
as an investment in an electrical ma
chine of perpetual motion.
Moraga is a well to do rancher in the
valley which claims his name; and Tim.
othy Mahoney was formerly employed by
the Southern Pacific Company at El Paso,
Texas. There Timothy began delving
into the secrets of perpetual motion.
"Last January Timothy believed that
he had discovered the secret whereby per
petual motion machines operated by elec
tricity could be constructed," says the
answer filed to-day, "but the feasibility
and practicability of the idea had not
been demonstrated, but the plaintiff be
came greatly exercised over perpetual
motion, and in view of soon reaping fab
ulous wealth offered to contribute the
$1500 for experiments."
The answer then goes on to aver that
Timothy soon quit his employment and
he and his mother were Induced to re
move to San Francisco, where he opened
a small shop on Mission street. There
he has ever since been studying and ex
perimenting and .working out his idea of
perfecting a perpetual motion machine,
and the $1600 has thus been applied.
So earnestly did Timothy work that in
June. 189S, so says the answer, near the
beginning of the Spanish-American war,
he was arrested by secret service officers
and accused of being a Spanish spy con
structing an infernal and destructive ma
chine to be used against the Federal Gov
ernment. This, for a time at least, cooled
his ardor, but the perpetual motion ma
chine has not yet been hatched, though
when it does, the answer sets forth, Mo
raga shall have a one-fourth interest in
the same, according to their agreement.
The defendants vigorously deny all allu
sion to fraud or inconsistency, and ask
that Moraga take nothing by his suit.

CUSTOMS OFFICIALS
USE THEIR REVOLVERS
VEGETABLE VENDER MISTAK-
EN FOR A SMUGGLER.
Mr. Gighilone Has an Unpleasant Ex
perience on the Bay Farm
Island Bridge.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 21.â Customs officials j
from San Francisco made an attempt this
morning to locate opium smugglers, sup- i
posed to have their headquarters on Bay \
Farm Island, and in their efforts came j
near shooting a vegetable peddler named .
Gighilone.
For some months a suspicious craft has ,
been making periodical visits along the |
western shore of the island, and once or |
twice has ventured up to the arm of the j
bay toward the Bay Farm Island bridge.
The movements of the vessel created con
siderable comment, and gave rise to the j
impression that she was engaged in some \
smuggling operation. It was suspected
that some- of the Italian or Chinese vege- ;
table gardeners on the island were In
league with the. supposed smugglers.
Last night three customs officers came |
from San Francisco on the last narrow
gauge boat, prepared to make an investi
gation. The mysterious boat had been
seen along the Island shore the day be
fore, and it was surmised that the smug
gled goods would be brought to Alameda
in the loads of vegetables that come from
the island every morning for shipment to
San Francisco and the towns around the
bay. The officials hid themselves on the
bridge leading into town to Intercept the
wagons coming this way. About 2 o'clock
Gighilone came along, and the officials
shouted to him to throw up his hands
and halt. Thinking the men were foot
pads, the vegetable vender whipped up his
horses to make his escape. The officials
drew their revolvers and began firing.
After several bullets had whizzed uncom
fortably near the Italian's head he con
cluded it was time to stop. He prepared
to yield up his valuables when the three
men surrounded him. He was greatly re
lieved when they announced they were
officers and that they suspected him of
being a smuggler. ...;y" . ' '
The men made a thorough search of
Gighilone's vegetables, but found no evi
dence that he was following anything but
a legal occupation. They then gave up
their plan of action and went to the
inland to try and locate the headquarters
of the alleged smugglers, but in this they
were also unsuccessful.
MRS. MARY HOLDEN IS
NOW REPORTED DEAD
SHE MYSTERIOUSLY DISAP
PEARED LAST AUGUST.
Left a Letter Threatening Suicide,
but It Proved to Be a Ruse to
Fool Her Creditors.
' ALAMEDA, Jan. 21.â Alameda rel- !
atives of Mrs. Mary Holden, who disap
peared from here last August, gave out
the statement to-day that the woman
died January' 3 at Allegheny. Pa. Mrs. A.
B. Andrews, sister of Mrs. Holden, states
that the news came in a letter sent to
parties in San Francisco. According to
the ! information Mrs. Holden was sick
but a day, pneumonia being the cause
of death. - ; ; -y.7 .â¢
When Mrs. Holden disappeared she left
a letter intimating that she intended to
commit suicide by jumping into the ocean
from the Cliff House. Later it developed
that she was heavily in debt and short in
her accounts with Thomas A. Smith, for
whom she acted as bookkeeper. V
Some weeks ago The Call published ex
clusively the fact that the woman was
not dead, but that her letter threatening
suicide was a ruse to keep her creditors
from tracking her.
Some of the Alameda creditors refuse to
believe the story that Mrs. Holden Is
dead. They are very bitter against her,
and assert their belief that she is the
author of the letter announcing her own
death.

Steamship Morgan City Hides a
Federal Scandal in Her Hold.
The Record of a Storm.
Tons of Bacon for the Troops at Manila
Were Received at the Ship in a
Drenching Rain â Secret of
a Profitable Contract.
LOCAL shippers and those inter
ested in the shipping interests of
this'port are wondering what the
Influences have been that have
resulted in the charter of the
steamer Morgan City to the Federal
Government. The Morgan City has
lain idle for over two weeks at the
Folsom-street wharf. She is under
commission to the United States Gov
ernment, and every day that she re
mains at this port it is understood that
the Government must pay $600. The
steamer has been ready to sail for two
weeks, but by authority of the Federal
Government she has remained in port.
The Morgan City was chartered as a
supply ship. She has on board provis
ions for the soldiers at Manila. While
she is not loaded to her greatest capac
ity she is weighted with food for the
men who left San J. rancisco to defend
American arms at Manila. The delay
in the sailing of the vessel has given
rise to a serious scandal, almost par
allel with that between General Miles
and General Eagan.
It Is claimed that some of the pro
visions which were consigned to the
Morgan City were improperly received
and are now on board the vessel in a
worthless condition -nd are a menace
to the other supplies which have been
packed in the hold of the ship. It is
asserted by those who have a reason
to know that when the Morgan City
and her cargo arrive at Manila the au
thorities will find that the supplies are
worthless.
It is claimed that hundreds of crates
of bacon were received on board the
Morgan City in a drenching rain, and
that the bacon is now in the hold work
ing damage to the other supplies. The
matter has been called to the attention
of Federal officers, but an investigation
has not yet been ordered. Experienced
shippers insist, however, that if the
vessel is permitted to make her voyage
she will do so in vain, as the climatic
conditions of the tropics will destroy
the provisions that are intended for
the American soldiers. The circum
stances attending the charter of the
Morgan City and the preparation of
her supplies are interesting. The facts
warrant the assertion that the Federal
Government has been imposed upon
and that private interests have reaped
an advantage that rightly belongs to
the United States Government.
It will be remembered that the Mor
gan City was originally chartered by
the United States Government as a
supply ship and transport last June.
The vessel made her journey to the
Philippines and returned. She was
originally purchased and brought to
this coast by the Ladue Yukon Trans
portation Company to ply between this
port at St. Michael. The Yukon
trade became unprofitable and the
Johnson-Locke Mercantile Company
became agents for the vessel, with an
Idea of using her in a better mission.
The result of the transfer of this agen
cy was that the Morgan City was char
tered by the United States Govern
ment to convey troops to Manila. Over
800 soldiers were carried to the Phil
ippines on board the vessel and on No
vember 3 the Morgan City returned to
this port. The ship and its owners were
again seeking service. Time passed and
nothing was done. The handling of the
vessel was taken away from the John
son-Locke Company and E. F. Bots
ford. general manager of the Ladue
Yukon Transportation Company, as
sumed control.
Every effort was then made to char
ter the ship again to the United States
Government. About this time Captain
Barnston of the firm of Barnston &
Chilcoott, stevedores at Port Towns
end, arrived at this port. Captain
Barnston had taken the ship Arizona to

the Philippines and had returned on a
furlough. It was understood that he
was in high favor with the national au
thorities for his service in connection
witlh the Arizona and it is understood
that his good offices were solicited to
secure a second charter for the Morgan
City.
Soon after the arrival of Captain
Barnston the Morgan City was again
chartered by the Federal Government.
This time the vessel was to be used
solely as a supply ship. It was agreed
that the vessel should carry supplies
from this port to Manila at $12 50 a ton,
ship's option weight or measurement.
This contract was made notwithstand
ing the fact that a lower bid had been
made.
It was announced that the Morgan
City would receive freight about De
cember 2S last at Folsom-street wharf.
The vessel was not then at the dock |
and did not arrive there until January
2, early in the morning. Supplies for
the' troops at Manila arrived, however,
and were placed "on the wharf in readi
ness for the coming of the ship. Among
these supplies were 9SO crates of bacon
from Swift & Co. of Chicago.
This enormous quantity of bacon ar
rived at the Southern Pacific depot in
a reasonably protected condition. An
order was at once given that it be con
veyed to the Folsom-street wharf. On
January 1 the bacon was carried from
the Southern Pacific freight sheds to
the Folsom-street wharf in drays of the
Morton Delivery Company.
One of the severest storms of the
season was in progress at the time.
The consignment of bacon was carried i
to its destination In a drenching rain. j
The drays were uncovered and the ba- '
con necessarily was soaked with water, i
A protest was made, but it counted for j
nothing. The receipts of the delivery |
company show that the crates of ba- I
con were received in the midst of the j
storm at the wharf.
On the following day the Morgan I
City, which had been in the stream,
docked at Folsom-street wharf , and the
task of loading her began. The con
signment of bacon, wet and dangerous
to other supplies in the ship, was
placed in the hold. Enormous quanti
ties of flour and other provisions were
packed upon the bacon. Those familiar
with conditions at the tropics insisted
that the damaged bacon should not be
shipped. It was argued that as soon as
the ship reached the tropics the bacon
would begin to steam and would not
only become worthless, but would de
stroy the other provisions In the hold.
The warning â¢ was unheeded and the
loading of the vessel continued until
its conclusion.
It is claimed now that the Morgan
City will convey to the Philippines noth
ing that will be of value to the United
States troops. The damaged bacon, lt
is asserted, will be worthless itself and
will destroy the other supplies. A pro
test has been made to the Commissary
Department of the United States Gov
ernment, but no reply has been given.
The ship is under orders and will sail
when commanded.
On Saturday, January 7, the Morgan
City was loaded, the hatches were down
and the ship was ready to sail. Then
came the unexpected announcement
that the vessel should remain ln port
until the Scandia should sail. The
Scandia has been chartered as a troop
. ship and at the very earliest will not be
ready to sail until the 25th inst. The
Morgan City, however, must wait in
order that she may carry the families
of the soldiers that will go to the Phil
ippines on the Scandia. Thousands of
dollars have already been squandered
by the national Government in delaying
the Morgan City and thousands more
will be wasted before the vessel sails.
When the order came to hold the
Morgan City in port the announce
ment was also made that the conditions
under which the ship had been char
tered had been changed. The shippers
were commanded to take no more
cargo, to wait for the families of the
soldiers and to prepare proper quarters
for the prospective passengers. It was
| then announced that the ship had been
chartered at $600 a day Instead of be
ing secured upon the basis of tonnage
capacity. The original charter had
been for $12 50 a ton. The second chap
ter made a tremendous difference in
cost to the disadvantage of the Gov
ernment. A comparison of figures will
demonstrate this fact
As already Indicated, the Morgan
City was chartered as a supply ship
upon a tonnage basis, the Government
agreeing to pay $12 50 a ton for freight.
At a very liberal estimate the capacity
| of the Morgan City is 2500 tons, which,
at $12 50 a ton, would have netted
$31,250. It is perhaps Interesting to
know that the owners of the vessel,
under the conditions which have now
I been fixed, will net $67,200 for the jour
ney of the vessel to Manila.
This sum as a matter of course in
cludes the expense of the delay In this
port, the cost of loading and unloading,
the tariff of the journey and the price
of stevedores. The Government of the
United States has deliberately cheated
I itself out of $36,000 and local shippers
are wondering why. The matter has
I occasioned considerable gossip and dis
i cussion, but the Morgan City is still
at Folsom wharf and the expense of
â¢ her charter still continues.

â¢ â â 'â 'â â â â  â â _
The mysterious disappearance of Mrs.
Julia Gale, wife of Charles Gale, a bar
tender living at 216% Sixth street, is puz
zling both the police and her friends.
She is a handsome woman, 26 years of
age, and was apparently happy in her
married life.
Last Tuesday she left her home without
giving her husband any Indication that
she would not return. She left her spare
clothes and her Jewelry in the house, and
only had 60" cents in her pocket. When
she had not returned by Wednesday af
ternoon, Gale communicated with the
police, after Inquiring at the different hos
pitals in the city, and since then Detec
tive Anthony has been working on the
case, but without so far learning any
thing as to her whereabouts.
Gale and his wife were married In New
York about five years ago. At the time
she was a widow with a child, but the
child was taken care of by Mrs. Gale's
Earents in New York, who are said to
c people of wealth. They came to this
city about a year ago, and Gale found
It difficult to get steady employment, and
he was, as he expressed it; "hard up."
But within the past few weeks things
have been brightening up, and that is
why he cannot understand why his wife
should absent herself from him. He has
not heard from her since Tuesday, -nor
has he the remotest idea as to where
she could go. He does not believe that
she could have met with foul play.
The police are also searching for two
young girls who disappeared from their
homes about a week ago. They are Sadie
Dolan, 407 Oak street, and Gertie Wil
liams, 593 Ash avenue. Both are 16 years
of age, and were constant companions.
Before disappearing they each received
a letter from Mrs. Emerson, 116 Taylor
street, which reads as follows:
"Young ladles, you did not keep your
appointment for last Sunday. If you want
to come call as soon as possible. I got
some work for you."
Mrs. Emerson says she is a dressmaker,
and when the girls called in answer to her
letter she did not like their appearance,
and sent them away. Officer McMurray
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children and Detective An
thony are working on the case, but have
failed to get any trace of the girls. They
are inclined to suspect that Mrs Emer
son knows more about them than she
cares to tell. The girls' parents are dis
tracted over their disappearance.
Gertie Smith, a girl ten years of age.
was also reported missing to the police
yesterday by her distracted mother, who
lives at 95S Harrison street. The girl
left home Friday afternoon, saying she
was Koing to Harrison street Â»hlll, but
did not return. Mrs. Smith Is afraid that
she has been abducted. y
TRADE WITH AUSTRALIA
â R. T. Greer Says the American People
Can Get It and Should Not
Lose the Opportunity.
R. T. Greer of the Pacific Ammonia and
Chemical Company, who spent considera
ble time in Sydney, recently returned from
that country, and in conversation on the
subject of American trade in Australia
said that American products are sup
planting the English and German impor
tations at a most remarkable rate.
He stated that the people of that coun
try have since the war with Spain shown
i not only a very warm friendship for the
people of the United States but have
shown an earnest desire to be supplied
with American products, which they for
i merly received from England and the
! German States. They, he said, express a
! great admiration for the Americans and
their methods of doing business. They
! have discovered that the people of this
1 country call upon them, ascertain their
! needs and supply them, something which
is not done by the representatives of the
other nations. They admire the liberal
: spirit of the Americans and' the Ameri
, cans recognizing this are adapting them
selves to supply the wants of the people.
"The American people." said he, "have
an opportunity now to expand their trade,
and they should not neglect that oppor
i tunity."

LIVED IN A CELLAR
ADJOINING A SEWER
Six Children Pined in
Filth Till Relieved
by the Police.
IN a cellar, into which the water
of the bay finds its way at high
tide and the seepage from the
Mission street sewer finds its way
at all times, five children, a man and
a dog have made their home for two
months past. It Is a fetid hole, the
air from which makes the passer
by hurry along, and the wonder is
that only the baby is sick. Yes
terday the matter was reported to
the Harbor police, and Captain Dun
leavy detailed Officers Lake and
Mackey to make an Investigation.
The place was located on Mission
street, near East, and when the po
licemen forced up the iron doors
that guard the entrance they found
a little fellow crouching on the steps
in his shirt, ' seeking to gain a
mouthful of fresh air.
A number of years ago Henry Kel
ly was one of the best known pro
duce men on the front. He was in
the employ of McDonough & John
son (now McDonough &Runyon) and
earning a large salary. Drink got
the better of him, and he lost his po
sition. He has "sworn off" a num
ber of times since and recovered
himself In a measure, but every fall
made things worse for his family,
until finally his wife left him, and
his six children had to take refuge
in a cellar. Yesterday the police
were hunting the waterfront for
Kelly, while his family was sent
temporarily to an aunt, who lives
near Valencia and Twenty-tttth
streets.

of vegetables and has quite a
number of customers. Two months
ago he "swore off," and A. P.
Lorentzen, the shipping man, gave
him a helping hand. He advanced
him money wherewith tp buy a lot
of potatoes, and gave him . the use
of the cellar at 10 Mission street in
which to store his goods.
Then the produce dealer went to
work and for a time did remark
ably well. In the back part of the
cellar, away from light and any pos
sible ventilation that might come
through the grating in +he sidewalk,
he put up a stove and two beds.
There he brought his childrenâNel
lie, aged 18; Annie, aged 15; Katie,
aged 13; Willie, aged 10: Henrietta,
aged 6, and Nina, aged 3, to live.
\V hen Kelly began drinking again
and the children began to droop for
want of fresh air, Mr. Lorentzen
thought it was time to notify the
police.
When the place was visited yes
terday the eldest girl, Nellie, had It
as clean as possible under the cir
cumstances, but the smell from the
sewer and the foul air was almost
unbearable. Sacks of potatoes were
piled along the wall and in the cor
ners were decaying onions and other
vegetables. Captain Olsen of Olsen,
Roth & Cook has taken one of the
girls, and a place win be found for
Nellie. The other children will be
put in a home and the father com
pelled to support them.

IMPRISONED
IN A SOUTH
AMERICAN JAIL
Fred C. Jones Returns
From Colombia.
CALIFORNiANS HAVE TROUBLE
COFFEE PLANTERS QUARREL
OVER RIGHTS..
Oppression by the Government of the
Republic of Colombia for Which
Retribution Will Be
Asked. .
Fred C. Jones, a San Franciscan who
has been engaged in coffee planting in
the Republic of Colombia, has just re
turned to this city from South Amer
ica and brings with him a story of
Spanish-American oppression which is
likely to result in international compli
cations, y.
Jones left this city a year ago and
bought lands from the Colombian Gov
ernment in the vicinity of David, the
capital of the province of Chiriaui. He
immediately set out his lands for the
raising of coffee, built himself a home
and made ready for a systematic culti
vation. â¢ In this he was assisted by
John R. Thomas and Elmer E. Sim
mons, both of this city.
The land which Jones occupied is ad
jacent to coffee fields through which
the State road runs. In order to short
en their path to the common water sun
ply John Jackson and Robert Medber
ry, formerly residents of Stockton and
owners of the adjacent land, cut a road
through Jones' property in the absence
of the latter, who was away on a busi
ness trip. On his return he blocked the
road, preventing traffic. Medberry and
Jackson attempted to reopen the road,
and in this they were opposed by Jon
"As soon as they were driven off,"
said Jones last night, "they went to
David and induced the prefect of the
province to send up a special commis
sion to investigate the disturbance.
This commission plied me with ques
tions which, under the law, I did not
need to answer, and so I refused. The
result of the commission's work was
that I was charged with an attempt
to murder and also punished for con
tempt of court because I did not answer
those questions which they told me I
did not have to answer.
"The same commission that investi
gated the road question acted upon the
contempt, as they called it, and I was
taken to David and put in jail. I made
several efforts to get an investigation
or a hearing to see if I was guilty of
the contempt for which they imprisoned
me. Before the time had expired I
was formally charged with attempted
murder, based og these accusations
which had been brought by Jackson
and Medberry. . _â ;

and I stayed there three weeks longer
before being released, which, with the
six days for contempt of court, made a

VICIOUS HATCHETMEN.
Tommy Naylor Is Assaulted by Two
Chinamen, but Puts Them to
Sleep.
"Tommy" Naylor, a policeman detailed
on the Chinatown squad, narrowly es
caped being made a subject for the Cor
oner by a murderous Chinese butcher
yesterday afternoon. Quong Yin, who
runs a butcher shop in Fish alley, attack
ed Naylor while he was attempting to
arrest another Chinaman. He came at
the policeman with a cleaver, but ex-
Deputy Sheriff Cody, who happened to
be in the alley, knocked the weapon from
the Chinaman's hand.
While making the rounds of the alleys
yesterday afternoon Naylor went through
a store on Dupont street to Â» the alley in
the rear. When he appeared in the street
lookouts of a fan-tan game gave the sig
nal of his approach, and the beans and
other paraphernalia of the game were
lowered from a window to a man named
Ah Chuck. The Chinaman started to run,
but, seeing the officer close on his heels,
entered the butcher shop of Quong Yin.
where he hid the sack of evidence in a
hole in the floor. Naylor saw the China
man hide the fan-tan layout, and when he
stooped over to procure it Ah Chuck as
saulted him.
The Chinaman had the best of the game
for a time, as he took the officer at a dis
advantage, but Naylor's pugilistic train
ing stood him in good hand. Regaining
his feet, he landed a short-arm right on
the Chinaman's Jaw and Ah Chuck was
counted out. While Naylor was engaged
with the fan-tan man Quong Yin came
upon him from behind with a cleaver.
Cody knocked the weapon from the Mon
gol's hand just as he was about to use it
on the policeman. By this time Naylor
had subdued Ah Chuck and turned his" at
tention to the butcher. A blow on the
point of the jaw of Quong Yin rendered
him useless as a fighting man, and by the
time the two Chinamen had recovered
consciousness both had been handcuffed.
Ah Chuck was booked at the Central
police station on the charges of disturbing
the peace and conducting a fan-tan game,
while Quong Yin was charged with inter
fering with an officer in the discharge of
his duty.
