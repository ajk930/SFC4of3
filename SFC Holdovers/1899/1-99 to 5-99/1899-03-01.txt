MANILA, Feb. 28.â 1t is re

release of the Spanish prisoners.
The offer was indignantly de

General Rios threatened to ex

Reports that the

untrue.
About twenty English sub
jects, including some women and
children, are within the rebels'
lines north of Manila. Nothing
has been heard of them since
February 5. 4
There has been the usual desultory
firing along various parts of the line,
but the only casualties to-day are Cap
tain David S. Elliott of Company G,
Twentieth Kansas Volunteers, and a
private of the same regiment. They
are both seriously wounded. They were
shot by the enemy's sharpshooters
near Caloocan.
A battalion of the Twenty-third
United States Infantry relieved the bat

trel arrived there on the 21st. Captain
Bormer of the British gunboat Pigmy,
â¢and the British Vice Consul, boarded
the Petrel immediately and then re
turned to the shore to confer with the
Insurgents. Eight leaders of the native

noon and conferred with Commander
Cromwell. They were afraid the Amer
icans would treat them as the Spanish
formerly didâ confiscate their property
â :â¢ and then shoot them. Therefore they
: ; desired to retain their arms.
Commander Cromwell assured them
that the present native Government
would rule under his supervision. He
â¢ gave them until S o'clock on the fol
lowing morning to surrender.
There was great fear among the for
. eignera that the hill men would come in
1 .sack the town during the night, so
landing parties were kept in readiness
on the Petrel. Punctually at 8 o'clock
the insurgent leaders arrived with a
formal written surrender which stated
' that they yielded to superior force and
must await the action of Aguinakio,

Wreck of Southern Pacific South
bound Passenger Train at
Cow Creek.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ROSEBURG, Or., Feb. 28.â The
south-bound passenger train on the
Southern Pacific was wrecked early
this morning near Nichols Station in
Cow Creek Canyon. The high water
brought down a huge drift which car
ried away the track.
The train reached the break at 5:30
and the engine plunged d<wn into the
gap left by the washout. As the en
gine rolled over Engineer Waite
climbed out of the cab window and
escaped uninjured txcept for a strained
back and a few bruises.
Fireman M. Devaney was pinned be
tween the firebox and a drift of logs
and held by the right foot. Everything
possible was done to rescue him, but
slow progress was made until the fire
was extinguished by letting the water
run into the firebox. Wet blankets
were hung up to protect the fireman
from the steam as much as possible.
At the same time water poured over

der the track. As the day wore on ho

rising water and it was apparent that
if not released he would drown. His
head was kept out of water by men
standing in the stream holding him up.
At one time the only chance to save j
him from death seemed to be to cut off â 
his leg. Fortunately, however, the
wrecking train arrived in time to pre- :
vent this. The brave fellow was in this !

DESIRES TO
BE FRIENDLY
He Asks American Protec
tion for Germans at
Manila.
Will Withdraw His Ships From
There and From Samoa, Rely
ing Upon Uncle Sam.
NEW YORK, Feb.. 28.â The Herald's
correspondent sends the following:
Substantial evidence of Germany's de
sire to maintain and improve the
friendly relations subsisting between
the Washington and Berlin Govern
ments has been furnished to the State
Department. At the request of Ger
many, the United States has consented
to protect German subjects and inter
ests in the Philippines and in Samoa,
and relying upon the promise of this
Government the German warships have
been withdrawn from those points.
In compliance with Germany's re
quest, cable instructions have been sent
to Rear Admiral Dewey and General
Otis informing them that hereafter
â¢German subjects and German interests
in the Philippines must be provided
with protection by American ships and
American troops.
It is apparent to the authorities that
the Berlin Government, in making
these requests, was actuated by a sin
cere desire to impress upon the Gov
ernment and people of the United
States the fact of Germany's friend
liness for this nation, and to prevent
in future all talk of prospective Ger
man interference in American affairs,
or any intention to take action which
might be distasteful to the United
States.
There is no doubt that Germany was
greatly surprised at the interpretation
placed in some quarters here on the
dispatch from Admiral Dewey stating
that for "political reasons" he desired
that the battleship Oregon should be
sent to Manila at once, and there
seems to be little doubt that it was
this interpretation, and the comments
which followed, that caused her to take
heroic measures and place her inter
ests and her subjects under the pro
tection of the United States.
With Germany's attitude so plainly
defined the authorities are now assured
that there is absolutely no danger of
foreign interference in the Philippines.
Following the request that the United
States take care of German subjects
and interests in the Philippines, the
State Department was informed that
the German armored cruiser Kaiserin
Augusta had been ordered to leave Ma
nila immediately for Tientsin, where a
display of force will probably be made
to compel the Chinese Government to
punish murderers and pay indemnity
for the murder of two Germans near
that point. With the departure of the
Kaiserin Augusta, Germany will be
without naval representation in the
Philippines, the Irene already having
gone to the Chinese coast.
As soon as the State Department
learned uf the wishes of the Berlin
Government Secretary Long and Secre
tary Alger were advised and the cabled
instructions to Rear Admiral Dewey
and General Otis followed, as already
stated.
With respect to Samoa the officials
admit that Germany has made a
shrewd move, which will prevent the
United States taking any decisive ac
tion without fully consulting Berlin,
By placing German interests there in
the hands of the Americans this Gov
ernment is made responsible and can
take no action detrimental to them. It
is intended to cable Rear Admiral
Kautz, when the department is advised
of the arrival of the Philadelphia at
Samoa, instructing him to comply with
the request of the Berlin Government.
It is now said by the autrtorities that
the Samoan question will be settled
without difficulty.
GERMANY WEARY OF
STRIFE OVER SAMOA
BERLIN, Feb. 28.â Baron yon Bulow,
Minister of Foreign Affairs, In the
Reichstag to-day discussed the ques
tion of Samoa, saying that by the gen
eral act of 1889 the triple rule of Ger
many, Great Britain and the United
States was established over these is
lands. If the condominium was wont to
lead to unpleasantness this would be
still more the case with tridominium.
Since the act came into force, he con
tinued, there had been no lack of fric
tion between the representatives of the
different powers, which was due to the
disorderly character of the population.
As early as 1891 a deep-rooted 'erment
showed itself in Samoa and in 183:; civil
war broke out between the followers of
Mataafa and Malietoa, and in conse
quence of the intervention of the Ger
man and British naval forces Maraafa
was deported.
A fresh insurrection which broke out
in 1894 was ended after the German and
British ships had intervened. In tiv.
overthrow of Tamasese last year the
three consuls proposed that Mataafa bo
brought back and Malietoa ooncurred.
The powers assented. At this juncture
Malietoa died, but the three consuls
declared that his death was no impedi
ment to the recall of Mataafa, who re
turned on board a German warship to
Samoa for installment as successor to
Malietoa. There arose an opposition
party who proclaimed Tanu, who was
still a minor, a candidate for the
throne. Both parties appealed to the
decision of the Chief Justice, who pro
nounced in favor of Tanu. Open fight
ing ensued, resulting in Mataafa's vic
tory. The three consuls, the Foreign
Minister then asserted, recognized the
fait accompli and a provisional govern
ment was formed from Mataafa's fol
lowers.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs then
said:
'The final settlement of the succes
sion rests with the powers. I refrain
from delivering a decisive judgment on
the whole course of events in Samoa
until the written reports arrive and
are closely examined. But I hold
strongly to the hope that we shall suc
ceed in disposing of these latest
troubles in Samoa with due protection
for German rights and interests and in
a manner which corresponds with the
friendly relations existing between the
three governments concerned.
"That things in Samoa require read
justment is a principle acknowledged
on all sides. It cannot be denied that
the tridominum has not stood the or
deal. We are prepared on our part to
consent to a clean separation if the two
other powers consent, but as long as
this agreement does not exist we shall
hold to the act of 1889 and we shall :iot
allow the rights which that act gave
us to be curtailed or our interests to
suffer diminution. But we shall also
respect the rights accruing to others
by virtue of the Samoa act."
Baron yon Buelow also made a state
ment relative to affairs in China. He said
that in view of the anti-foreign irrita
tion, particularly the fact that several
Germans were grossly insulted and
afterward assaulted at Tientsin last
Sunday, he had instructed the German
Minister at Peking to make it perfectly
clear that if such acts were not severe
ly punished, or if there was recurrence
of such acts, grave consequences would
ensue for the Chinese Government. He
added :
"We do not intend to interfere in the
internal affairs of China, but duty com
pels us to protect the lives and prop
erty of Germans."
Referring to the construction of the
railroad and other improvements in the
province of Shantung, the Minister of
Foreign Affairs said an agreement was
about to be concluded between the Ger
man empire and a syndicate of German
East Asiatic capitalists for the forma
tion of a joint stock company with a
capital of 50,000,000 marks, with head
quarters at Bintau, the empire partici
pating in the profits.
With reference to the statements
published in foreign newspapers re
garding the supposed action of the
German warship Irene in the Philip
pines and the alleged conduct of Rear
Admiral Dewey, who, it has been said,
threatened to sink the steam pinnace
of the Irene, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs said these statements belong to
the category of "plump canards," pre
viously described by him. So far as he
knew the Irene was not in the Philip
pines, but was at Hongkong, and the
only German warship at Manila was
the Kaiserin Augusta. There were, he
added', a considerable number of Ger
man merchants in the Philippines,
whom the German navy was anxious to
protect during the Hispano-American
war.
â We hope," the Minister said, "that
our countrymen will find security under
American rule."

G. K. FITCH LAUDS
THE CALL'S EFFORTS
TO DEFEAT BURNS
The Earnest and Sincere Advocate of
Pure Government Voices the Sen
timent of All Good Citizens
of California.
GEORGE K. FITCH, for nearly half a century in the
foremost rank of earnest citizens who have been striv
ing to secure pure government for California, and
who, while editor of the Bulletin 1 , mercilessly flayed corrupt
politicians, indorses the efforts now being made by this
paper to prevent the election of Dan Burns to the United
States Senate. Mr. Fitch says:
"I agree with The Call in this fight against Burns and
other corrupt men who may seek to represent California in
the Senate. Burns is absolutely the worst man who could
be selected ior that honorable position. By electing him
the Legislature will place an ineffaceable blot on the his
tory of our commonwealth. It is not necessary for me to
give the reasons for my opinion. They have all been told in
the columns of The Call.
"I would rather see any one than Burns sent to Wash
ington."
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
his undying wrath if they did not con
sent to go into secret caucus and take
such medicine as the caucus mixed for
them.
Shortrldge is not a diplomat. His
threats and his imprecations were the
threats and the imprecations of Burns,
but they should have been concealed
behind honeyed words and soft phrases.
Realizing this, his fellow followers of
the Mexican hastened to assure the
outraged legislators that Shortridge
diil not speak by the book and that
their utterances alone should be con
i sidered as a reflection of the peace,2
harmony and brotherly love that per
vades the atmosphere of the Burns cor
ral.
But it -was too late. All who heard
knew that Shortridge echoed the senti
ments of his master, and that in his
Santa Claran simplicity he had failed
to conceal what a wiser politician
would have known would prove inju
rious to his own cause. The meaning
of it all was as plain as the handwrit
ing on the wall. It amounted to an
open declaration of the fact that Burns
and the railroad intend to club mem
bers into a caucus and to hold over
their heads the threat of political
death that has already been promul
gated through the editorial columns of
the railroad's organ, the Sacramento
Record-Union.
The Burns supporters who attended
the conference â and they were present
to a manâ were brought to a realiza
tion of the fact that Burns is not popu
lar with the legislators nor with the
people whom the legislators represent.
There is no mistaking the feeling that
prompts a declaration that it would be
better for the State and for the Re
publican party to have no Senator at
all than to have Burns for Senator.
Such a sentiment was uttered in the
conference to-day, and there was every
evidence to support the belief that it
met with general approval.
After the conference had been called
to order by Chairman Flint, he de
clared the business in order was the
hearing of suggestions or arguments
from members. There was a painful
silence for several moments, it being
apparent that no one cared to open- the
ball. Then Assemblyman Brown of
San Mateo came to the rescue by mov
ing that the conference adjourn sine
die. As this did not seem to meet with
general approval the motion was with
drawn. â ;;:â :' |
Assemblyman Grovel Johnson of Sac
ramento then addressed the conference
in carefully modulated tones, after the
manner of a kind father who, more in
sorrow than In anger, would reason
with an erring son. He declared that
what was needed is harmony and that
all should meet and talk together with
that object in view.
"It seems to me," he said, "that the
best and only way to arrive at a speedy '
and just conclusion of this difficulty ip
to go into caucus and select a caucus
nominee. 1 am willing to vote for any
one that may be selected by a caucus.
It has been suggested that we go into
caucus where sixty votes shall be re
quired to govern the action of the cau
cus. I am .willing to do that, or I am I
willing to go into a caucus where two
thirds of the members present shall
govern the acts of the whole body. 1
am willing to do anything of this kind,
but I think the best plan would be to
have a caucus where say forty-three
votes would govern."
It was very nicely and very softly
put, but there was no mistaking what
was meant. Senator Cutter of Yuba
was one of those who understood for
he replied to Johnson and bitterly de
nounced the caucus scheme as a plan
to elect Burns against the wishes of the
people and in a manner that will not
be expressive of the will of the ma
jority.
"It would be better," he declared,
"that California should be represented
in the upper house of Congress by but
one Senator than to send there a man
who is opposed by the people of the
State."
It was at this point that Senator
Shortridge demanded the attention of
the meeting. He hammered the top of
his desk and declared the men who
were opposed to Burns were cowards
and were afraid to vote for the rail
road candidate because of a fear of the
"libelous press."
"We will have a caucus," he shouted,
"and we will elect a Senator."
"What do you mean by saying that
you will have a caucus and elect a
Senator?" interrupted Assemblyman
Melick,
"I mean what I say."
"Do you mean that you are going to
nominate and elect a Senator your-
self?"
â  I mean what I say," again replied
Shortridge, and Mr. Melick gave it up
without having plumbed the well of the
eloquent Senator's meaning.
Shortridge closed his most remark
able address with the remarkable
statement that it was Burns who
elected Henry T. Gage Governor. There
are some" thousands of Republicans
throughout the State who have up to
the present time been congratulating
themselves with the thought that they
had some part in Gage's election. It
remained for the Senator from Santa
Clara to disabuse their minds and
throw the blame where it belongs.
Senator Davis of Amador had a word
to say to Shortridge that would have
made that gentleman feel uncomfort
a'lle if it were possible to ruffle the
Shortridge complacency.
""You have exposed your hand." said
Davis, "and we now know what you
are here for. It appears that you in
tend to use this conference to further
your scheme for a secret caucus and
elect to the United States Senate a
man who is obnoxious to the people of
the State. I repeat that you have
shown your hand. You call us cow
ards because we dare to vote as our
consciences dictate and as all honest
men should vote. We vote as we
do because we want to save the Re
publican party the disgrace of sending
to the United States Senate a man who
is not wanted by the people of the
State. The gentlemen on the other
Bide "
"I object to yotir including all of us
when you are referring to what Senator
Shortridge has said," interrupted John-
Fnn. "We do not indorse what Senator
Shortridge has said, and when I say
co I believe that I speak for a majority
of those who are voting for Colonel
Burns."
"Very well," replied Davis, not dis
turbed in the least by the interruption
that was intended to cover up the bad
break that had been made by the mem
her from the prune district. "All the
other candidates have expressed a will
ingness to withdraw if by doing so
the present situation would be re
lieved."
"So has Colonel Burns," declared
Johnson.
"If so I have never heard of it, and I
gret it now for the first time without au
thority, la there any gentleman here
who is voting for Burns who will get
up here on this floor and say that he
has authority to say that Burns has
ever offered or now offers to withdraw
if all other candidates will do the
same?"
As no one offered to reply it was
made evident that Mr. Johnson was
drawing upon his imagination when he
made the statement. This conclusion
was mado a certainty later in the day
:-when Burns assured several newspaper
men who interviewed him on the sub-
Bthat he had never offered to with
y from the contest and that he did
intend to do so. Furthermore, he
never authorized Johnson or any
else to make such a statement as
was made in the conference by John
son.
. Assemblyman Belshaw of Contra
Costa renewed the proposition he made
yesterday to have all of the present
candidates withdraw from the contest.
. He made a motion to the effect that ali
'members withdraw their support from
present candidates and then go into
caucus and nominate some new man.
Dibble and others of the Burns contin
gent opposed the proposition and aftpr
some desultory firing back and forth
the motion was dropped.
A motion was then made to adjourn
until 4 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
Cutter offered an amendment making
the adjournment sine die. A roll call
â was demanded and in order to expedite
matters Chairman Flint put the origi
nal motion first. The motion was
adopted by a vote of 41 ayes to 31 noes,
and the meeting was declared ad
journed until to-morrow.
â  Six Bulla men, six Grant men and six
Barnes men voted for adjournment.
When eeen later in thÂ« day they all de
clared that there was no special sig
nificance in their vote. They wanted,
they said, to give Senator Shortridge a
ehaYice to make one more speech, be
lieving that if he cfid so Burns would
be killed off M> effectively that he would
never be heard of again.
DOUBLE-HEADED
SLOT MACHINE
"CINCH" BILL
Hungry Legislators Say the
Ghost Most Walk Soon or
Trouble Will Follow.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 2R.â There has been an un
dercurrent of excitement in the Assembly
to-day over threatened action in connec
tion with a measure that is antagonistic
to the syndicate which controls nickel-in
the slot machines in this State.
A bill prohibiting absolutely the very
I existence of these machines in California
j has been introduced, and a powerful lob
by has assembled here to defeat the bill.
j Some of tho legislators, tired of being
i "good fellows" for the benefit of their
j friends, threatened to make the bill an
affair of urgency, and immediately there
was a stir In the lobby. A telegram was
sent to San Francisco for reinforcements,
and two more "attorneys" have arrived.
These it was feared were not enough, and
the general agent of the syndicate was
i commanded to come at once.
Some of the legislators, whose condition
is rather mysteriously described as hun
! gry. Insist that the ghost must walk soon
;or there will be trouble. The "attorneys"
; are doing their utmost to soothe the ex
! citement of the honorable lawmakers, but
| there is excellent reason to believe that
only one balm will cure the distemper.
! â¢ The history of the proposed legislation
i against the slot machines constitutes an
' Interesting* chapter of the present session.
| Men well known in the State are Involved
In the matter. Officers who are employed
by the Federal Government for certain
duties are devoting the time that belongs
|to the Government in the lobby. They are
â¢ seen day after day in consultation with
I legislators, and the nature of their con
' ferencei is not for a moment misunder
stood.
One of these men is Jake Steppacher,
the chief deputy collector of Internal rev
enue in the office of Collector John Lynch.
Steppacher is drawing a large salary from
the I'nited States Government to perform
i certain duties in San Francisco. By the
1 courtesy of Lynch, -*lr. Steppacher is here
! earning .another salary to prevent the
' adoption of the bill antagonistic to the
'â¢ slot machine syndicate. He has been here
i practically for the entire session, ostensl
i Dly acting as one of the touts of Dan
â¢ Burns. This, however, has been a blind,
!as Steppacher's political influence does
i not extend beyond the horizon of his own
self-interest. He is here ostensibly to
Bwejl the motley gang that surrounds
! Burns, and primarily to feather his own
nest. ._,.. T ,
The running mate in the lobby is Jake
Shaen, who is in the service of the United
States Appraisers, and also draws a fed
eral salary for which he gives nothing in
return. Shaen is an honorary member of
the Burns brigade of boosters, but he is
ievoting very little time to the campaign
jf the Mexican in order that he may give
much to an effort to defeat the cinch
bill against the sjot machine syndicate, on
what some of the legislators *ay pathetic
ally is chin music.
The reinforcements that arrived to-day
consisted of ex-Superior Judge Walter H.
Levy and Jack Chretien. Both are nrmly
convinced that the very foundation^ stone
of the State would be shattered if the bill
prohibiting slot machines ever became a
law. Phil Crimmins is also in the field,
and completes the quintet that is working
to defeat the bill. In order that there may
be no misunderstanding and that no lib
erties be taken, it should not be forgotten
that these nve interesting persons are

that class familiarly known as "cinch

from the disagreeable necessity 01 walk
ing home. The anti-slot machine bill was
introduced by Huber in the Assembly I
and Braunhart in the Senate. Both gen
tlemen undoubtedly introduced the meas
ure under the inspiration of a worthy
purpose. The developments that are of
Interest came after. The bill is most
drpstic in its provisions. It prohibits the
manufacture, sale, purchase, control or
operation of slot machines in the State.
Under the provisions of the bill no person
may permit another to use a slot machine,
and any one using such a machine shall
be guilty of an unlawful act. Any officer
of the peace who shall neglect to enforce
the provisions of the proposed law shall
be dismissed.
The penalty for others shall be a fine of
not less than $50 nor more than $500, or im
prisonment for a term of six months or
both fine and imprisonment. This pro
posed law almost gave the members of the
slot machine syndicate an attack of heart
failure. Certain legislators looked upon
the measure with a degree of satisfaction
that could not be disguised. Many thou
sands of dollars in investment and untold
thousands in profit are represented in
threatened legislation. It is no exaggera
tion to say that hundreds of slot ma
chines, operated In cigar stands and sa
loons in San Francisco, take in from $50
to $100 every day they are operated.
It is little wonder therefore that cer
tain legislators sought from a double mo
tive to force the bill forward to some is
sue. The lobby has stubbornly fought
any advance, but the fight has been made
on a basis of "good fellowship." The
matter has now reached a crisis. The
lobby must act or there will be fun. One
of the interesting features of the affair
is the fact that Steppacher and Shaen
are subservient satellites of Mose Gunst,
who is deeply interested as a gambler In
the slot machines. Shaen and Steppacher
are therefore involved in the clever game
of working both ends against the mid
dle.
Where the matter will end remains to
be seen. That the bill is a worthy one
is generally conceded. That it is being
advanced toward adoption for pur
poses that will not recommend themselves
for honesty is also conceded. Legislators
who vote for the measure know they ar*.
encouraging "cinch" legislation. Thou*
that vote against it know that they are
defeating a measure of unquestioned
merit. In either case honest men are on
the horns of a dilemma.
Until f> few days ago the lobby sneered
at the threats of the Assembly to take
the measure up. Members of the lobby
declared that they could do their work
in the Senate. The upper house is a
more select body a,ny way, and pains*
taking members of the lobby do not havo
to make arguments to so many people.
It saves time and other things. But when
the Assembly seemed in earnest the tun&
of the lobby changed. It is said that th*
music has not yet got the right ring and
that is why the State representatives
have been sent for In haste. There is
bursting in the breasts of some of th*>
legislators a renewed hope that Provi
dence and cinch bills may mean some
thing yet. Meanwhile Jack Steppacher.
Jack Shaen. Judge Levy, Jack Chretien
and Phil Crimmins are looking uncomÂ»
fortably wise.
H. Wolf, the agent of the slot machines,
to whom the urgent telegram was sent
this afternoon, arrived on the last train
to-night. He and Judge Levy at once held
a conference on the situation. Jake Step
pachor was also called into consultation,
and the trio formulated their plans to cir
cumvent the hungry ones to-day.

DIBBLE'S BLUFF
QUICKLY CALLED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 28.â Assemblyman Dibble of
San Francisco rose to a question of priv
ilege In the Assembly this morning. He
did so for the purpose of denying that he
had broken faith with those who are fight
ing in the interests of the city of Placer
ville against the bills which Dibble intro
duced with the intent of ruining that pros
perous mining town financially.
The Call of this morning stated emphat
ically that Mr. Dibble had not only broken
faith with his colleagues but in doing so
had resorted to the meanest and smallest
political trickery. The Call article
brought, to back its statement, the
charges made against Dibble by Assem
blyman Valentine of Los Angeles, who,
with Raw of El Dorado and Caminetti of
Amador, has taken up the cudgel in a
hard light for the little town in the Sierra
foothills.
Mr. Dibble's speech to-day was his usual
scathing denial. It was nothing mure.
He brought nothing to back it. buc relied
solely on his time-worn, loud-mouthed
bluff, and for once his bluff was most em
phatically called.
"I deny," said Mr. Dibble, "that I have
broken faith with Mr. Valentine in this
matter, and he will bear me out in what
I say. He called upon me shortly after
the committee bad decided that this was
a good bill to pass, and Mr. Raw called
upon me, and I promised them I would
recommit the bill. When it came up on
second reading file Saturday 1 thought it
could be as well recommitted from the
third reading file as from the second, and
1 allowed it to pass with the rest. I did
not think it would be just to the oppo
nents of the bill or its friends not to ad
vance it. I appeal to Mr. Valentine. He
will say that I did not break faith with
him."
Mr. Dibble"? appeal to Valentine bore
fruit, but it was not of a variety that
tickled Dibble's palate. Instead of bear
ing out Mr. Dibble's rather prolix expla
nation, he gave it the contradiction di
rect, although couched in the nice verbi-

age and accent that characterize the
speech of the southron always.
"I am willing," said he, "to accept
Judge Dibble's explanation that he did
as he did under a misapprehension, al
though I cannot agree with him upon
what he says of the agreement betweei
"He promised me when I found that
the bill had been recommended to the
committee to pass that he would recom
mit it. Then it appeared on the special
file and I went to him and had him put
it back to its proper place on the second
reading file, and he told me it would be
sent back to committee.
"When I was away on Saturday, as he
save, under the impression that 1 wanted
the bill passed to third reading, he put it
through that course. He has now again
consented to recommit it."
The explanation of Mr. Valentine was
evidently not just what the gentleman
from San Francisco anticipated. He
munched viciously at his mustache and
refrained from further statement. val
entine nmiled and sat down with the air
of a man who had had an easy time get
tins even. That Mr. Valentine and his
confreres played the right hand was dem
onstrated to-night when Dibble s little
ioker turned up before the Judiciary Com
mittee and a whole half hour was given
to Judge Williams to explain fully the
bunko game that is being attempted on
his community. He recited the facts as

in which to explain that his proposition

rapher, from $2139 65 to $2079 65.
The bill relating to the societies for tho
prevention of cruelty to animals wan
taken up again to-day, and Senator Bul
la's amendment, providing that fines levied
on offenders against the humane laws ho
paid to the society first formed in the
county, where there arc more societies
than one, was adopted. The whole dis
cussion of the bill grew out of the strained
relations between the rival societies in
San Francisco and the effort to have the
fines divided between them.
The proceedings were enlivened some
what by Senator Doty, who read a tele
gram from N. P. Cole of the San Fran
cisco society, in which he said he had
heard that Senator Wolfe had made the
statement on the floor of the Senate that
the society was in favor of allowing fines
to go into the school fund. Cole tele
graphed that this was untrue and that
if the statement had ever been made
it had come from a man who had been
expelled from the society. Senator Wolfo
made no such statement before the Sen
ate and he so stated on a question of
privilege. As a matter of fact he had not
Epoken to the question at all. Senator
Doty declared he had ne personal fc-fl
ing in the matter and he had read the
telegram only because the discussion had
taken the trend it had. He declared ho
though Senator Wolfe one of the most
reliable men on the floor and with that
compliment everybody was satisfied.
Johnson's Assembly bill 651, authorizing
the Governor to appoint agents to collect

pressed the general sentiment when he
said the State had an Attorney General
and District Attorneys and Senators and
Representatives in Congress and "h*;
thought they were capable of collecting
all the money due. The bill was lost by a
vote of lfi ayes and 17 noes.

the Government to inquire into the al

SAN FRANCISCO NORMAL
SCHOOL BILL CONSIDERED
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 2S.â Senator Braunhart's
bill for the establishment of a Nor
mal School in San Francisco came up for
consideration before the Senate this
evening, but there was no action beyond
the adoption of a substitute.
In the original bill it is provided that
an. appropriation of $150,000 be allowed for
the building and maintenance of a Normal
School in San Francisco to take the place
of the one which was abolished by the
Board of Education a few weeks ago. In
the original bill a building was provided
for and also a site, two facts which ex
plained the size of the appropriation, but
in the substitute this amount is cut down
to $45,000, and the building is left out of
consideration.
The introduction of the bill was in con
sequence of the demand of the members
of the present classes in the school, but
as it was seen that, in all probability. th->
larger appropriation would not go
through, it was decided to appropriate
urily so much aB would be necessary to
keep the present school going and so pro
vide for the pupils now in attendance
there.
RAILROAD INTEREST
IN CAR FENDERS
GETS PROTECTION
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Feb. 28.â Assemblyman Dibble of
San Francisco led the fight for good old
Uncle Collis against Senator Braunhart's
fender bill when it came up this after
noon in the Assembly. He was seconded
by Grovel Johnson. i
The debate was not so much on the bill
as on the amendment offered yesterday by
Dibble. The amendment provided that
if the governing body of any city or city
and county shall Belect some one fender
as suitable its adoption by the railroad
companies shall be considered compliance
with the law.
O'Brien, Hanley and Warden of the San
Francisco delegation took issue with Dib
ble and fought from the first his at
tempt on behalf of tb# corporations to
throw the whole fender proposition into
the hands of the Board of Supervisors.
O'Brien said that San Francisco's new
Board of Supervisors had demonstrated
by fixing the water rates at Spring val
ley figures that they could be no more
trusted than the last lot, and that as a
San Franciscan he did not -want to dele
gate so much power to the county gov
ernment for that reason.
Johnson replied in a humorous speech
of some length. He denied that San
Francis-cos Supervisors had ever been
proved crooked. He also denied that tne
blood of 150 innocent victims of Mr. \ tn
ing's juggernaut was crying aloud for
vengeance, and like Mr. Vining and Mr.
Dibble before him. said such sentiment
was nonsense; that the scores of the
victims who have been ground to death
under San Francisco's fenderless cars
met death voluntarily.
Dibble practically repeated his speech
of yesterday, and moved that the bill be
referred to 'a committee of one to amend
along the lines he laid down ' >'<Â«tcrdaÂ£
The motion was carried, and Dibble who
was appointed as the committee, forth-
Crowder of San Diego offered
an amendment confining the bill in its
operation to cities of the first class, and
it was ordered back to the printer.
JOHNSON'S LATEST
EXHIBITION OF GALL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 28.â 8y an impertinence to
the Senate, Assemblyman Johnson of Sac
ramento this morning attempted to add
another of his Job chafers to the already
overfat list that is feeding at the crib.
This latest position which Johnson seeks
to create is about as useless a specimen
aÂ«! has yet been stuffed on the roll. It was
so raw." in fact, that Johnson did not even
desire that the salary it contemplated be
paid out of the Assembly's funds. On the
contrary, We wanted it charged to the
contingent fund of the Senate, notwith
standing that he has not been invited to
dabble in the Senate's sack, no matter
what liberties he has taken with the As
sembly's.
As to the utility of the position he
wanted to create, his resolution is ex
planatory. It follows :
Resolved, That each State officer shall re
ceive two copies each of all bills, concurrent
resolutions and constitutional amendments in
troduced in the Senate, except the State Libra
rian who shall receive five copies of each; and
that' Joseph Gratz be and he hereby is ap
pointed to deliver the same, and keep the file
for each State officer, at a per diem of $3. pay
able out of the contingent fund of the Senate.

mittee on Attaches.
EXPOSITION BILL TO
BE DISCUSSED TO-DAY
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 28.â The several bills and
resolutions relating to the big exposition
to be held in San Francisco in 1901 will be
considered by the various committees to
morrow, and it will not be long before
they all pass both houses of the Legisla
ture.
It has been reported around the Capitol
that the whole committee of arrange
ments will be up to-morrow on a special
train to be present at the consideration
of the exposition measures and to give
such advice and explanation as may be
found necessary. More than one of the
Senators received notices of invitation to
be at the wharf at 8 o'clock to-morrow
morning to take the ferry for Oakland,
where the special train will be waiting,
but as they were already on the ground
the notices only served to heraJd the ap
proach of the committee.
The committee of arrangements of the
big exposition is composed of nearly two
hundred of the most prominent men in
the city, and they with tlie friends and
supporters who will come with them will
make up a goodly train load.
There are sevaral bills all affecting the
exposition now pending before the houses
of the Legislature, and it is expected tnat
after the committee has had its say they
will go through without question or de
lay.
Negotiable Instrument Law Passed.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 2S.â Senator Stratton'3 bill
relating to the law of negotiable instru
ments was passed by the Senate this
evening, after some opposition from two
or three of the Senators. The bill as
passed is a bulky document. It is the
result of a careful scrutiny of the laws
relating to commercial writings in several
of the States, and the effect of the adop
tion of the law is to codify all the regula
tions regarding notes, checks, bills of ex
change and similar paper. The opposition
to the bill came mostly from those Sena
tors who had not read the measure and
who on that account did not feel free to
vote for such an important and far-reach
ing innovation. It was explained that as
a matter of fact the bill did little morÂ»
than classify the law as it already extst3
and make such amendments as were
found desirable and which had been found
to be practical in other States It was
carried with not more than one or two
dissenting votes.
Narrow Escape for Dalton.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACR-Y
--MENTO, Feb. 25.-The Alameda delega
tion had a rather warm session of it this
morning when it came together to dis
cuss further the internal workings of
their county government. Assessor
Henry Dalton and the perquisites of his
office were the chief topics and main ob
jects of attack. Senators Stratton and
Taylor introduced a resolution cutting off
Dalton's fees, amounting to about $6000
per annum, for collecting poll taxes and
other levies. The resolution was adopted
before the delegation knew just what it
was doing, and later to-day a roar went
up because of it. Stratton and Taylor
finally conseilted to withdraw the resolu
tion, and a peace was finally patched up.
DAN BURNS NOW
FACE TO FACE
WITH DEFEAT
No Show Left for the Candidate of
the Southern Pacific.
TIDE OF INDIGNATION TOO STRONG
Utmost Limit of His Strength Has Been Reached, and
It Is Conclusively Proved That Only by Secret
Ballot Can He Possibly Win.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO, Feb. 28.â Dan Burns
is beaten. Though barren of
other results, the events of the past
two days have demonstrated beyond
a doubt, if any existed, that the
Southern Pacific Company's candi
date for United States Senator will
never be elected, and the State will
be saved from the misfortune that
would have followed such election.
Yesterday the Republican members
of the Legislature held a Senatorial
conference and vied with each other in
denouncing Burns' candidacy as a
menace to the Republican party and
prejudicial to the interests of the people
of the State. To-day they held another
conference and repeated the action of
yesterday. There was no mistaking the
sentiment of the conference. Two or
three of the leaders of the Burns forces
tried to stem the tide of indignant pro
test that was poured out on the head
of the Cadelaria candidate and his at
tempted manipulation of the machinery
of the party to gain his selfish ends, but
their efforts proved worse than futile.
Even Burns' closest friends and polit
ical managers admit that he cannot
win, unless he can succeed in inducing
the Republican legislators to go into
caucus where the secret ballot would
protect those who have a desire to be
tray their constituents by voting for
him. The conference of yesterday dem
onstrated to a certainty that a great
majority of the Republican legislators
are bitterly opposed to a secret caucus
or a caucus of any kind, for the stated
reason that they will not permit Burns
to force himself into the United States
Senate by means of any dark-lantern
method, or with the aid of political
trickery. The fight must be fought to
a finish in the open, where the people of
the State will be able to see all that
transpires and thus place themselves
in a position to mark the traitors and
punish them as they deserve.
By judicious doses of bluff and blup
ter Burns has kept the legislators n
doubt as to his strength for weeks. Now
his pitiful weakness is exposed and he
is seen to be as dead, politically, as the
proverbial doornail. His race has been
run and the Republican members of the
Legislature will now engage in the nec
essary task of selecting from among
the remaining candidates a United
States Senator who will be acceptable
to the people of the State.
In the conference to-day Grove L.
Johnson made the ctatement that the
candidate for whom he was voting
would withdraw if other candidates in
the field would agree likewise to retire
from the race.
Senator Davis of Amador, who knows
as well as others know that Johnson's
candidate is Dan Burns, sought at once
to ascertain if Johnson had authority
to make the statement. If Johnson
speaks with the sanction of Burns the
way may be cleared for the election of
a United States Senato The Call un
derstands that U. S. Grant, W. H. L.
Barnes, R. N. Bulla and Irving M.
Scott have signified a willingness to be
eliminated from the contest for the
sake of of securing the election of a
Republican United States Senator, pro
vided Burns would agree to step aside.
At the conference to-day the position
of Burns in this respect should be
made clear. Johnson, Dibble or some
other legislator in the confidence of
Burns should go there clothed with au
thority to express views of the Can
delaria candidate. Senator Shortridge
of Santa Clara, a devoted supporter
and admirer of Burns, might be en
gaged to again express the true in
wardness of the machine campaign.
Three weeks ago Burns might have
exercised a powerful influence in nam
ing the next United States Senator
from California, but his power has been
wasted since that time in a vain ef
fort to gratify a selfish ambition to
have himself elected to the Senate.
Hervey Lindley is still acting manager
of the Burns campaign, but the events
of the last few days afford him no hope
of success as a manager of the "Colo
nel's" fight.
Thomas R. Bard has written a letter
to each of his three supporters in the
Legislature in which he announces that
he is not a candidate for United States
Senator and avows that he does not
seek to control the action of the mem
bers of the Legislature who voluntarily
accorded him their support: Mr. Bard
holds that he never was a candidate in
the strict sense of the term, but was
simply voted for by his friends in the
Legislature.
Assemblyman Greenwell, who had
been voting for U. S. Grant until the
Ventura County Committee instructed
him to cast his vote for Mr. Bard, will
to-morrow rejoin the Grant column.
Speaking on this topic to-night Mr.
Greenwell said that he had not ex
pressed a preference for any candidate.
"I shall probably vote for Mr. Grant
to-morrow," said Assemblyman Green
well.
It is known that Dr. Rowell enter
tains a high regard for the abilities and
party service of General Barnes and it
is regarded as almost certain that the
Fresno Senator will join the Barnes
column. At one time Dr. Rowell had
made up his mind to cast his vote for
Senator Bulla. but when his resolution
was formed the Ventura influence to
brace up the supporters of Mr. Bard
began to be felt and so the change to
Bulla was not made.
In the message by telephone which
J. T. Richards of Santa Barbara re
ceived Monday evening from Thomas
R. Bard the latter did not signify a de
sire that the members of the Legisla
ture who were supporting him should
vote on his retirement for U. S. Grant.
Mr. Bard did not say to Mr. Richards
that he desired Senators Flint and
j Rowell and Assemblyman Greenwell to
I vote for any particular candidate. He
simply announced his withdrawal.
The supporters of Grant will hold a
caucus at 12:30 p. m. to-morrow. Be
i fore the hour of 4 o'clock the supporters
j of Barnes and Buila may confer. Since
j Shortridge has disclosed Burns' hand
i and declared for a secret caucus it is
| probable that the members of the Leg
j islature who are opposed to the elec
} tion of Burns will not participate fur
; ther in the conference proceedings.
I They do not care to be called cowards
! and sneaks for resisting a dark-lantern
' caucus.
General Barnes is constantly receiv
; ing encouraging telegrams and letters
i from leading citizens of the State. ThA
j messages urge him to stand firm and
; assure him that the sentiment of the
': people is in his favor. The following
i telegram was received to-day:
OAKLAND, CaL, Feb. 2S, 1899.
\V. H. L. Barnes, Sacramento: One
j hundred of the best citizens and business
men Sunday signed indorsing you for
Senator. A thousand more would if they
i had a chance. No compromise. Stay
! with it. GEORGE BABCOCK.
To-day Judge A. P. Catlin of Sacra-
I mento sent to the general's headquar
j ters a basket of beautiful flowers.
Wilton Green arrived here yesterday,
I but did not tarry for any great length
\of time at Grant's headquarters. He
I sought the seclusion and comforts
; which the house of his brother affords.
The Grant forces are displaying a bold
front, and declaring that Burns' last
chance of success has gone glimmering.
! Assemblyman Greenwell did not to-day
I change his vote back from Bard to
i Grant as was expected. Mr. Bard, in
i his letter to his friends, did not suggest
that they should vote for Grant, but
: left them free to go wherever they

It is of great importance in that it defi

Following- is a brief digest of the bill:
The government of cities relating to mu

so that the phrase has been employed
generally throughout the title, instead of
the word "cities," "city and county." or

INDORSES HIS CONDEMNATION
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Feb. 28.â 0n the floor of the Assera- J
bly this afternoon Grove L. Johnson, one of the chief supporters of Dan Burns' Sena-
torial campaign, made the following statement: I
41 1 believe John P. Dunn to be one of the most honest and truthful men who ever held
public office in the State of California." i
During^he time John P. Dunn occupied the office of State Controller he made an ex- â¢
animation of the accounts of the Secretary of State during the time Dan Burns was the in- â¢
cumbent of that office. â¢
The substance of the result of that investigation is contained in the opening paragraph
of the report made by him to E. C. Marshall, then Attorney General. It is as follows: I
"Tlon. E. C. Marshall. Attorney Generalâ Sir: 1 have the honor herewith to transmit
to you the result of an investigation of the office of the Secretary of State during the incum- â¢

JANKERS SAVE THEIR
TRUST DEED SECURITIES
.ALL HEADQUARTERS, BACRA
â IEXTO. Feb. -*S.â There was one inter
ire to this evening's sossion of
ssembly. It was the only feature of
st throughout the entire day and it
â¢ red itself around Assembly bill 102,
ij Dunlap of San Joaquin.
Mr. Dunlap's bill was one that the
â  *ankers h tt their especial mis
â¢ kill. If passed it would have taken
Tom their choicest security on loans and
riven the borrower the same right 01
Kjuity redemption under a trust deed that
â¢ie has under the present law under a
. "-simple mortgage.
â¢ The Legislature of 1597 passed a law
: ' intending the time of redemption on
nortgages from six months to one year. but I ,
â¢'riade no such provision for trust deeds. j
â¢â¢â  'Since that time bankers who have been j
- n a position to demand it have required j
.rust deeds rather than mortgages as se
â â .â â¢uriiy upon loans. Mr. Dunlap's measure
. posed to give the borrower the same
â -' right of redemption under a trust deed.
Among his other corporate Interests
' 2rovei Johnson has carefully looked to (
'â¢ hose of the barks, and this evening he i
' ed the fight that was made against Dun- j
ap's bill, and it was a hot one.
â  â¢ He said that if the bill were passed it j
jvcwild work a great injury upon the bor
.â¢â¢-owers, and incidentally upon the bank- â 
ers. Nobody really demanded the passage I
â ' if such an act. he said, not even the bor- |
rowers. It would do no one good ana
â ' would work harm to each party con
' cerned in a transaction in which a trust |
leed as security was contemplated. j
â¢ â¢â¢ Mead of Los Angeles strongly seconded j
â¢. Johnson. He said the mortgage tax under â 
the present constitution, which was a ;
product .and a bad one, of Dennis Kearney;
nd his sand lotters. worked a great harm |
' -â¢n the borrower, in that it raised his rate >
of interest from I to 2 or 3 per cent per .
â  innum. and he said the redemption clause .
was another of its Iniquities.
Johnson's keen interest in the welfare j
" of the borrower was the weak point in j
' his argument. It furnished Dunlap with j
.a small-sized club with which to strike
rack and he did bo. He said that he
could' not understand this sudden con- j
â¢â¢ â¢ ration on the part of the bankers and
' "-their representatives for the poor bor
â¢â ' rower, and he argued the pros and cons
. "â  of the bill as he has before argued it in
â¢committee. . He was seconded by CamM
. . netti and Cobb. but when the bill came to
" a 1 vote it failed of passage.

"Hon G. G. Cloughâ My Dear Judge:
I desire to express my earnest indorse
ment of your legislative action in vot-
X! for- General W. H. L. Barnes for
â¢ the United States Senate. . And also in
' offering that resolution requiring each
candidate for the Senate to deliver an
â¢ oration before the Assembly or cease
to be a candidate for Senatorial honors.
' This resolution was eminently pro
per and should have been adopted and
â¢ arted upon at once, for the good reason
that any man who cannot make a
â sSech suitable to be heard by any
â¢t^Tshitiv^ body is not -qualified to oc
â¢ cupv a seat in our United States Sen-
ate.
â We have already sent . too . many

--> SI I must say I am not only aston
" i-hed but an. sorely perplexed over tbfc
'â¢ Situation, and I sometimes ask myself
the question: -'ls it .possible .that our
â¢â¢ American people have ceased to appre
â¢ elate talent, that oratory and states
manlike qualities have been relegated
to a back seat, as fit and durable only
for lite in private life, and that our
: United States Senate chamber, made so
' famous by our Websters. Clays, Cal
houns and Bentons of the past, has
been converted into a banquet hall for |
the rich men of to-day?'
â And when I read of the disgraceful
expenditures of money in this Sena
torial contest I can hardly, suppress the
wish that the humble Nazarene could
return to-day and with his scourge,
sharper and stronger than of old, whip
the wicked money-changers out of our
temples of legislation.
'It is to be deeply regretted that our
' men of eminent fitness for the high of
fice of United States Senator, who are
too proud to beg for political favors and
b .norable to buy them, or to be
bought, should be left to rust in the
obscurities of private life, while oh^ek
and trickery and money should so often
carry the unworthy and incompetent
, ones to the front.
"And when I look over the political
field of to-day it seems to me that we
are rapidly drifting into the whirlpool
of political disaster by reason of the
sheer negligence and thought'.essn
the people in th" selection of those who
are to represent them in important po

A FIT MANAGER
FOR MEXICAN DAN
According to the unimpeachable tes
timony of two leading men of Biskiyoa
County the reputation of Hervey Lind
ley. Dan Burns" newest lieutenant, for
truth, veracity and integrity, is very bad.
These men are David Horn, a merchant
at Hornbrook, who is aJso chairman of
the Siskiyou Board of Supervisors, and
Dr. G. W. Dwinelle of Klamathon. who
under oath in the United States Circuit
Court testified that Lindley bore an un
savory reputation in Siskiyou County,
where he had been doing business for
some time.
This testimony was given in connection
with a lawsuit, the Poktgama Sugar Pine
Lumber Company vs. the Klamath River
Lumber and Improvement Company, of
which Lindley was the promoter an. l
manager. During the trial of the case
Lindley was squarely impeached by testi
mony "from his own lips.
In ' April. 1897. Lindley leased the ex
tensive lumber plant of the Klamath
River Company, which was owned by
John R. Cook & Sons. Under the con
tract Lindley was to conduct the busi
ness for the be*t interests of all con
cerned and pay the Cooks one-third of the
profits. During the first year the lessee
manufactured only 1.0w.000 feet of ium
ber. and the original owners of the plant,
believing their property was being de
stroyed by mismanagement or worse,
availed themselves of a fortunate pro- .
vision in the lease and retook the prop- ;
er-y. Lin.ilev brought suit in Siskiyou
County to retain possession, but his case
was thrown out of court. His next move
was to come to San Francisco and secure
an injunction in the Circuit Court, Judge
Morrow restraining the Cooks from re
taking their plant, at the same time tiling
a new suit. The injunction left Lindley
in active possession pending the deter
mination of the suit instituted in the
Circuit Court. The Cooks shut down th.
mills, but not understanding the meaning
of the court's order refuse*" to surrender
the property to Lindley. and. as a result. ;
for contempt. The con
tempt proceedings came up before Judge
.'.â¢ 'a> T November. Lindley was tne
chief witness against the Cooks, and in
self-protection these men impeached him
On the witness-stand Lindley testitied
that John R. Cook had deeded to him the
railroad line and lumber <-hutes con- ;
Red with the lumber plant. Senator
tton, one of Cook's counsel, asked
if he had not reronveyed this prop
to the younger Cooks. In ansyr
to repeated questions Lindley denied that
he had ever executed or delivered such a
paper. Stratton then met Dean Mason.
one Of Lindleys partners, on the stand
and proved that such a d^ed had been de
livered, and to complete the impeachment
thÂ« original document, signed and ac
knowledged by Lindley. was produced.
These fa.ts are taken from the official
re,-.,rd of the United States Circuit
Court.
AFTER THE DEER SLAYERS.
The Stat* Fish and Game Commission
er! are well pleased with the efforts of
one of their deputies in Shasta county.
During the recent snow storms in the
mountains in that district the deer and
other wild game were driven out of their
hiding places into the more open foothills.
From all accounts they appeared by the
thousands and fell easy victims to the
rifles of hunters, who. disregarding the
law slaughtered without mercy or limit.
The county officers paid no attention to the
violations of the laws, and the Commis
sioners. In seeking a man who was not
only a hunter. but who is keenly interested
In the preservation of fame of all kinds,
were referred to \V. S. Conway.
Con way was made a deputy, and has
arrested "thr^e men for killng deer out of
season and for having deer meat in their
possession In the closed season. The of
fenders are well known in Shasta County.
They are J. S. Fields. Cole and Williams.
Yesterday the Commissioners received a
letter from Mr. Conway stating that he
had secured the conviction of Fields in the
Justice Court of Costella. The cases of
the other two offenders comes up for trial
io-atbtrov in Dunsmuir.

by Its officers and stockholders, made ap
; piication to the Superior Court of this city
for permission to change Its name to plain
"French Savings Bank." The reason i
given was that the first name was cum- '
bersome, unwieldy and inconvenient in i
the transaction of business, and that its
nu-kning was only understood by persons
having a knowledge of the French lan- j
guage. Victor Marchebout objected to the
change In the form of a demurrer, claim
ing that the Legislature, and not a State
: court, has the nght to change the names
of persons and corporations.
The request of the bank was. however, I
granted and an appeal was taken upon
the ground that the law upon which the !
change was made by the lower court is
unconstitutional. The order of the lower
court has been sustained, the Supreme
Cour' holding that for the Legislature to j
make such a change would be by a special
act and that the power to change a
n.inie. as in this case, has been conferred
upon State courts.

MARKED THE HEADS
THAT ARE TO FALL
ACTION BY SCHOOL BOARD AT A
SPECIAL SESSION.
Committee on Elementary Education's
Resolution Relating to Vice Prin
cipalships Is Adopted.
A special meeting of the Board of Edu
cation was held last night to consider the
matter of vice principalshipa. At the last
meeting resolutions were adopted which
legislated a number of vice principals out
of office, but It was not known just what
heads would drop In the basket.
The Committee on Elementary Educa
tion last night reported the following res
olutions, which were adopted by the
board, thus settling the matter:
Resolved, That in schools having more vice
principals than are called for by the resolution
of the Board of Education, adopted February
23. 1599, the positions â  â :' the vice principals
last appointed as such to said schools be and
the same are hereby abolished.
Resolved, That in schools entitled to two vice
principals, under the resolutions of the board
adopted February 23 the said vice principals be
designated as senior and junior vice principals
according to the chronological order of their
appointment.
Another resolution submitted by the
same committee instructed the Superin
tendent to advise the principal of Han
cock Grammar School to conform with
r the provision of rule 35, adopted in 1896.
This principal has opened a receiving
class in her school, which the rule re
ferred to strictly forbids. ~l'.~-lt
The committee also recommended the
: appointment of E. Knowlton to the .vice
principalship of Everett School. Mr
Brandenstein objected. He said he did
nut know any particular reason why Mr.
Knowlton should or should not be given
the position, and desired an explanation.
Mr. Stow was of the same opinion and
also asked for an explanation. It came
from Directors Eels and Head, who said
: the appointment was in accordance with
a resolution already adopted to the effect
that when a vacancy occurred the ap
pointment be given to the oldest man In
the department legislate^ out. This
seemed satisfactory, and Mr. Knowlton
was unanimously elected. ... '-,â
The following resolution, which will
have some bearing on the test case about
to come up, was also adopted:
Whereas On December 30, ISM, there were a
number of teachers without classes', in excess
of the needs of the department: and
â Whereas. The school hind, appropriated for
IS3S-99 was insufficient to justify the appoint
ment or pay the salaries of such teachers; and
Whereas ' The late Board of Education on
th* said last mentioned date, without any Just
cause In the face of a deficit exceeding $2.>0.
--000 elected a large number of probationary and
Â«ui>stttute teachers; be it
Resolved, That all persons elected as regular
teachers by the late Board of Education upon
the 30th .lay of December. MM, are hereby dis
missed from the department. ' V '
Through an em r of some kind the res
olution introduced at the last meeting by
Mr 'Stow bad the .iouhle effect of abol
ishing ten old Jqbs and making six new
ones He explained matters last night
a:<<l by the insertion of the few words un
intentionally omitted fixed things up.
This error has been the cause of much
unjust criticism of the board.
SIMONSEN PLEADED GUILTY.
Jules Simonsen. alias Stewart, the Tiv- j
oil song bird, porch-climber and all-round j
burglar, cast aside his heroic attitude j
â when about to be placed on trial before !
Judge Dunne and pleaded guilty to a
charge of burglary. Simonsen was ar
rested while in the act of looting the resi
dence of A. R. Heyman. C 23 Eddy street,
and locked up in the tanks of the City
Prison. He assumed an attitude of in
jured innocence, and when arraigned
pleaded not guilty. As the ease against
him was positive he finally relented, and
rather than stand trial, with the prospect
of a mTe severe sentence in event of a ;
conviction, which was inevitable, he with
draw hi= former plea and entered one of
guilty. Saturday he will be sentenced and
enter on his term in prison.

PROGRESS IN
REAL ESTATE
STILL SLOW
Few Large Sales Are
Being Made.
CAUSE OF THE STAGNATION
INVESTORS ARE TIMID ABOUT
RISKING MONEY.
A Complete Review of the Records,
Recent Sales and New Build
ing Contracts â General
Notes of Interest.
The world of realty was characterized '
by little If any progress during the past
week. Sales were few and of extremely
low value. The most important transac
tion was the purchase of the property on
the northerly line of Fourteenth street,
between Jessie and Stevenson streets, by :
the College of Physicians and Surgeons
through the agency of the real estate firm
of Hooker & Lent. The price paid was j
$16,000. A three-story building will be im- j
mediately erected on the site at an esti- j
mated cost of 130,000. The architecture of I
it will conform to the colonial style.
Beyond the negotiation of the sale of i
this property there were few others j
that could be given more than brief men
tion. : i v -â ;
The cause of the stagnation in the mar- j
! ket is attributed to hard times and the I
timidity of investors who are afraid to j
risk the chance of any sort of a purchase ,
unless it be a small one.
The building operations in the city dur- j
j ing the past seven days were slightly in ;
: advance of those recorded for the pre- j
! ceding week, but not sufficiently exten- ;
' sive to create encouragement among
i the builders.
The record of mortgages was unusuall> .
poor, there being few pledges taken foÂ«
an amount exceeding the $10,000 limit.
The releases and reconveyances were also ;
i few in number and small in value.
During the week there were forty-five
I mortgages and trust deeds recorded,
amounting to an aggregate value of $122,
--j 413. For the same period rtfty-three re
; leases and reconveyances passed to record
in the total sum of $271,675. l*j l _. m _\
The principal mortgages and trust deeds
are as follows: By the German Savings
and Loan Society to Samuel J.. Wilhel
. mina. C. F.. John H. and Albertie M.
' Hendy. $25,000 for one year at 7 per cent J

MAYOR PHELAN WOULD
REDUCE THE GRADE
SUGGESTS IMPROVEMENT OF
GOLDEN GATE AVENUE.
To Cut Down the Thoroughfare From
Taylor to Hyde. Thus Remov
ing a Hill.
Mayor Phelan has suggested to Chair
man Aipeltenger of the Street Committee
*cf the Supervisors an improvement that
would make a marked change in Gold*n
Gate avenue. This is nothing less than
reducing the grade of the avenue at Jones
Aigeltenger. after a hasty
survey of the situation, has arrived at the
conclusion that if a cut be made work
man be commenced at Hyde street. At
Leavenworth there would be a cut of
some ten or twelve feet, and at Jones
Â«treet of eight feet. This would necessi
tate the lowering of both Jones and Leav
enwnrth streets. Mr. Aigeltenger is of the
f.pfnion that the work would require too
large an expenditure of money to be un
dertaken under the present condition of
th i e f dofie S tnere nC would "be a lot of gndtag
r,f adiacent property necessary to make
the houses easy of access from the street-.

the sailing vessel Jane Gray had not been
collected. John Boyle. H^&ry Mohr and
Louis Feldman went sur#os on the bond i
pending an appeal to the LmteU States
Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal wag
never perfected, and Mr. \\ oodworth
asked the court yesterday on behaJf of
thÂ«Â» Government to have the case placed

Mr VVnodworth moved that the case be
dismissed, the appeal not having oeen
perfected. The motion was granted and

Tracing the Chloroformers.
It Is now expected that the two men
who chloroformed and robbed John
Strothoff. a saloonkeeper on Third street,
early Sunday morning wiH soon be lo
cated as they are well known. At about
mMiniJtht Saturday the two men were in
another saloon on Third street, where
they made themselves so obnoxious that
the" proprietor drove them out at the
noint of a pistol. The statement that
Strothoff was intoxicated is indignantly
denied by friends who saw him just before
the robbery.

Fruit and Grain Helped by the Pre

storm.
Special Disratch to The Call.
REDDING, Feb. 2S.â A gentle rain
set in at dark last night and continued
at intervals throughout the night. By
morning the ground wag soaked.
Throughout the day a heavy rain fell,
starting water in the creeks and flood
ing the streets in this city. The rain
came in the nick of time for the farm
ers. If the precipitation continues the
placer mining industry will receive a
great stimulus. Should it turn clear
and cold much fruit now in blossom
would be killed. There was a heavy
downpour at 8 o'clock to-night.
AUBUR^. Feb. 28â There was a
. slight fall of rain this morning and the
'â  weather continued cool and threatening
| all day, with indications for a shower
j to-night. It is encouraging- to farmers
for feed and grain are at a standstill.
What the miners want is snow and rain
! and lots of it. The watersheds were
j completely drained last season.
DUNSMUIR. Feb. 28.â At midnight
; the south wind brought a gentle spring
! rain which increased until at no<>n to
i day one inch had fallen. It has gp'wn
i colder, with an east wind, which pre
â  sages a steady downpour for several
j days. This rain is a great boon to the
farmers, stockmen and miners of Sis
! kiyou County.
COTTONWOOD, Feb. 28.â The sixth
' heavy rain of the season is falling in
Cottonwood Valley, comprising the
north end of Tehama and the south
end of Shasta counties. All grain crops
I are in good condition for this time of
! the year. Orchardists are in good
; spirits, expecting big crops.
N.\PA, Feb. 2S.â Rain began falling
! at 8:30 p. m.. thus ending the distress
'-. ing drought which had affected all mi
i terests.
GI'ERNEVILLE. Feb. 28.â At 1
i o'clock this morning a lively downpour
of rain set in and continued for about
two hours, giving the growing crops a
! thorough wetting and making north
' western Sonoma safe for grain and hay
j for this reason. Everything in the
fruit and nut line is rapidly getting
' into full blossom and the only thing
I now to be dreaded is the danger from
frost that is liable to occur during the
! last week in March. Just after the sun
I crosses the equinoxial line.
CHICO. Feb. 28.â Rain began falling
' here at 7 o'clock this evening, tt will

Rice Rupture Cure.
Wonderfully Brilliant Invention Sold
at a Low Price.
A Home Cure That Is Restoring
t Thousands to Perfect Health,
Many Remarkable In-
stances.
Some time aco Munsey's Magazine contains*
an article on rupture, with a number of Illus-
trations showing the remarkable curative effect
of a system invented by Dr. \V. S. Rice, *'â & N.
t^tfvgu, ps -j_ , fe^iio
MR. LAWRENCE E. METER.
Main street. Adam?. N. Y. Lawrence E. Meyer
of Syracuse. X. V. offers another fortunate
Instance of the marvelous results of Dr. Rice's
method. The Important points are that the rup-
ture, no matter how large, dangerous or old It
may be. is securely and comfortably retained
within the abdomen. At the same time thÂ»
broken muscles are made to grow together and
become as firm and solid aÂ« any other portion
of the abdomen. It Is a home cure, the patient
using the method himself, and the price is so
low that every one can afford it. Mr. Meyer
says of the cure: "I tried the method of Dr.
Rice because it seemed such a vast improve-
ment over anything else I had used, and also
combined curative effects such as no other rup-
ture treatment contains. Of course I hadn't
much faith in the possibility of a cure, but thÂ»
results are remarkable. Whereas I had been
laid up for months before, now the rupture did
not bother me for a minute. It was only a
ohort time when I couldn't feel any trace of
where the rupture had been, and I soon was
able to work all day a? freely as a young man.
I advise every ruptured man or woman to semi
at once and get this method, as it will certain-
ly cure permanently and perfectly." Mr Meyer's
advice is good. Upon application to Dr. Rice,
he will send you free a book that fully ex-
plain? how , he cures . rupture. If you know o?
another person ruptured send and (set a book
for him Such an act of kindness will he re-
membered ail the rest of his life. Write to-day
without fail. Address* Dr. W. S. Rice, 41* X.
Main street. Adam?. X. Y. .The book is mailed
free to all who send name and address.

SILLY STAGE OF
THE BEEF INQUIRY
Court SeeKs to Entrap Witnesses
by Compelliog Them to
Eat Stews.
5 WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â The feature of the Court of Inquiry Into â 
jC* General Miles' beef charges to-day was an object lesson in canned |3
Â§ meats prepared by the court and served to the non-commissioned men g
.g who testified at yesterday's hearing. The court had prepared eight gs
Â« plates of beefâ fresh beef, canned beef that had been to Cuba and canned 5
i* beef fresh from the factory. Four plates were prepared hot in a stew Â£
;Â« and four cold as they came from the can, the fresh beef being boiled to â¢ S?
Â« make it resemble the others. The enlisted men were ordered to sample 0
V each arid say which was the sort they had had in Cuba. 85
Â£ It was a trying ordeal for the men. most of them declaring that Â«

BRIBERY CHARGE
WAS NOT PROVED
The CaseAgrainst Hanna
Falls Flat.
SENATE COMMITTEE REPORT
RECOMMENDS THAT NO ACTION
BE TAKEN.
Democratic Members Submit a Minor
ity Report Asking That Fur
ther Investigation
Be Had.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â Senator
Chandler from the Committee on Privi
leges and Elections to-day presented to
the Senate the report of that commit
tee on the charges of bribery in the
election to the Senate of M. A. Hanna.
as made by the Ohio Senate. The re
port states that no direct remonstrance
setting out that Mr. Hanna was elect
ed through bribery or ought to be ex
pelled from the Senate had been re
ceived by the Senate. It also shows
that no one had appeared before the
committee and that no papers have
been received beyond the formal report
of the action of the State Senate.
Notwithstanding these failures the
committee has investigated the
charges. It rinds that "there is no
proof submitted either that (1) Mr.
Hanna was elected Senator through
bribery; or (2) that he had any agents
engaged in carrying on his canvass for
the Senate who were directly or im
pliedly authorized by him to resort to
corrupt methods or to any form of
wrong-doing; or C J >) that he had any
personal knowledge of the facts of this
case. It may be said that there is no
evidence which fairly tends to prove
either of the foregoing three proposi
tions."
In view of these facts the Committee
on Privileges and Elections has reached
thÂ° conclusion that the "United States
Senate is not called upon to take any
action in the premises."
A minority report signed by Senators
Turley, Pettus and Caffery was pre
sented by Senator Turley. This report
takes the position that a further inves
tigation should be made and enters
quite fully into the statement of the
case presented by the Ohio Senate.
The minority then says:
We think the evidence to which we
have already referred, standing as it does
uricontradicted and unexplained, shows
that certain of Mr. Hanna's managers
at Columbus not only knew the purpose
which Boyee had in view in Cincinnati,
hut also that they aided, abetted and ad
vised him in carrying out these purposes,
and that this state of affairs existed while
Mr. Hanna was present at his headquar-'
ters. This view is strengthened by two
facts. First, that many of the witnesses
whose testimony apparently would have
thrown much light upon the subject, un
der inquiry denied the jurisdiction of the
committee and refused to testify under
the advice of counsel, who stated that
they represented the interests of Rath
bone and Dick and Senator Hanna; and
second, that Mr. Hanna and his repre
sentatives had Bubpenas sent them by
mail which seem to have reached them,
calling upon, them to appear before the
State Senate Committee, to which they
made no response.

Southwest is on. Both operators and
miners refuse to budge an inch from

there is absolutely no prospect of a set

TOM WEST ALMOST BLINDED
"JACK" BONNER'S SECONDS USE
A DRUG.
Referee White, Himself Affected by
the Fumes, Stops the Fight and
Gives the New Yorker
the Decision.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â The contest
between "Tommy" West of this city
dnd "Jack" Bonner of Summit Hill,
Pa., which took place at the Lenox
Athletic Club to-night, was brought to
a sudden termination at the beginning
of the eighth round. During the inter
mission between the seventh and
eighth rounds Bonner's seconds used a
fluid known as oil of mustard, the
fumes of which are blinding. The oil
was rubbed on Bonner's gloves and
the fumes of It blinded those who were
sitting close by the ringside. As soon
as the men shaped for the eighth
round West got a whiff of the stuff.
and when Bonner landed on "Tommy's"
face the latter shouted:
"He's got some stuff on his gloves
that is blinding me."
By this time Referee Charley White
was similarly affected, and he began
rubbing his eyes, at the same fane
chouting to the men to go to their
corners.
Meanwhile West was jumping fran
tically in his corner with pain, and his
seconds got through the ropes to help
him. Bonner's seconds also clambered
through the ropes and began taking
the gloves off the big fellow.
The police took a hand in the game
at this moment. Captain Brown with
a couple of sergeants and a dozen pat
rolmen got over the ropes. Referee
White called on the police to arrest
Bonner's seconds, bur "Jack's" hand
lers protested, and said Bonner's man
ager, Fred Miller, had handed the hot
tle of oil to them after the seventh
round and said it was a good thing
to use.
When White heard this he made a
dash for the principal second, but the
police prevented him from striking the
fellow.
White then declared West the win
ner. There was a howl from Bonner's
backers, but the bets went with the
referee's decision, and those who laid
money on the big fellow felt that they
had been wronged.
During all this time the spectators
were standing on the chairs and
benches clamoring to know what it was
all about. The master of ceremonies,
as soon as he could make himself
heard, explained the matter fully, and
when he announced thp decision of the
referee there were loud and prolonged
cheers.
Just what prompted the handlers to
use the stuff was not made clear, but it
was evidently done to place West at a
disadvantage, as up to the close of the
preceding round the New Yorker had
more than held his own.
Bonner's seconds were "Johnny" Gor
man, "Billy" Needham, "Charley"
O'Brien and "Jack" Neville. Bonner
was the favorite in the betting, 2 to
1 being freely laid on him.
One man who had a box seat at the
ringside had an altercation with man
ager Tom O'Rourke and some blows
were struck, but the men were separ
ated immediately and the building was
soon vacated. No arrests were made.
YOUNG JESSE JAMES
FOUND NOT GUILTY
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Feb. 28.â Young
Jesse James, son of the notorious bandit
whose name he bears, was to-night ad
judged not guilty of complicity in
robbery of a Missouri Pacific express
train at Leeds, in the outskirts of Kansas
City. The robbery, which the police ac
cused young James of having been the
leader, was committed on September 23
last, and was the last of numerous train
robberies in the outskirts of Kansas City.
The jury was out less than an hour, and
the verdict of acquittal was reached on
the first ballot.
In rendering their verdict of acquittal
the Jurors were compelled tn discredit en
tirely tho confession of Witness W. W.
Lowe, who admitted having been a mem
ber of the band and who described the
robbery in every detail, implicating as his
accomplices young James, "Andy' Ryan,
"Bill" Ryan, alias Evans, and several
others.
After returning the verdict members of
the Jury said they could not accept thÂ«
Lowe confession rr the theory of the po
lice, adding that the police, located James
in too many places in a very brief time.

STAID SENATORS
FORGET DIGNITY
Frenzy of Bill-Passing
Seizes Them.
CLAMOR FOR APPROPRIATIONS
MEASURES AND AMENDMENTS
BUSHED THROUGH.
Stockton and Los Angeles Profit,
Each Being Granted Funds for
the Erection of a Public
Building.
Ppwial Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â A frenzy of
bill-passing was on in the Senate to
day. The bills passed were principally
public building measures and at times
during the day and night the scenes
in the Senate were remarkable. Sena
tors usually staid and dignified, stick
lers for order and decorum in the cham
ber, clamored for consideration of bills
providing for the erection of Govern
ment buildings in which they were in
terested.
Bills carrying an aggregate of eight
or ten millions of dollars were passed,
and many more that had not been
passed by both houses of Congress
were placed as amendments in the sun
dry civil appropriation bill. Finally,
at a late hour to-night, an amendment
to the sundry civil bill was adopted
appropriating nearly $4,000,000 for the
preliminary work on the buildings
which had been authorized.
The sundry civil bill was passed at
11:15 to-night, having been technically
under consideration throughout the
day and evening.
The House bill increasing the limit of
cost of the public building at Stockton, '
Cal., to $156,900 was passed with an
amendment providing for the erection
of a public building at Los Angeles at
a cost of $250,000, $100,000 of which is
carried by the" bill.
Morgan secured the adoption of a
resolution continuing the select com
mittee on the Nicaragua canal and au
thorizing it to hold sessions during the
recess of Congress.
A partial conference report on the
postofflce appropriation bill was agreed
to. The matter remaining in disagree- j
ment is the subject of a special appro
priation for fast mail service for the !
South and between Kansas City and I
Newton, Kans. The Senate further in- j
sisted upon its amendments and an- !
other conference was ordered.
BILLS BUSHED THROUGH.
Action of the Senate Imitated in the
House.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 28.â The House
spent practically the entire time of the
seven hours' session to-day passing the
public building bills favorably acted
upon by the committee of the whole ten
days ago. The opposition sought in vain
to consume time by rollcalls and other
filibustering tactics, but their numbers
were so slim that in no case could they
sceure a rollcall. At last their efforts -to
impede the passage of the bills was aban
doned, and the bills were passed with
great rapidity. Sixty-one in all were
passed, carrying $9,350,000. $750,000 of
which, however (the amount appropriated
for the New York Custom-house.) is to be
repaid from the proceeds of the sale of
the old building.
The following bills were passed, de

feated:

MARYLAND'S GIFT TO
REAR ADMIRAL SCHLEY
BALTIMORE, Feb. 28.â Rear Admiral

from the people of this his native State
a superb testimonial of the esteem in
which he is held by the poople
of Maryland and of their apprecia
tion of his services to the coun

I Incidentally he was cheered by assembled
thousands as he rode through the streets
of Baltimore, and at night 400 of the rep
resentative men of the city and State
gathered to witness the presentation of
I the testimonial and join in a banquet

The testimonial proper took the form of
a magnificent medal of gold and diamonds
of great intrinsic worth and resplendent
beauty, the gift of Maryland, presented in
the name of the State by Governor Lloyd
Lowndes.
[ENDS HIS LIFE IN
A CHICAGO DEPOT
CHICAGO. Feb. 28.â Mystery surrounds
the identity of a well-dressed man who
died at the Northwestern depot to-day
under circumstances which indicate sui
cide. In the man's possession were found
a commutation ticket to Bavenswood and
a letter stating the bearer was Fred T.
Carrington of San Francisco, and that he
was suffering from heart disease. Every
possible mark of identification about the
clothing was destroyed, and with the ex
ception of a note there was nothing to in
dicate the mans name was Carrington.
When this discovery was made the police
began working on the theory that the
man ended his life, probably by poisoning
himself. He was apparently about 35
years of age.

AMERICAN FLAG
HOISTED AT GUAM
Governor Taussig Takes
Charge.
SALUTES TO OLD GLORY
GUNS OF THJi BENNINGTON
THUNDER.
Commander of the Warship linds
the Island Treasury Empty
and the Revenues Very
Xaght.
HONOLULU, Feb. 21.â Commander
Taussig of the Bennington is the first
American Governor of Guam. The
American flag went up over the new
possession at 10:30 a. m. on February 1.
It was raised over Fort Santa Cruz in
the harbor of San Luis d'Apra, the
main harbor of Guam, and saluted by
the guns of the Bennington. Simul
taneously it was raised over the gov
ernment buildings at Agana, five miles
distant and was saluted by a battalion
from the Bennington and a company
of native militia with a field battery.
The paymaster of the Bennington is
the United States Collector of Revenues
for Guam. Everything is quiet and
orderly.
The United States collier Brutus,
Captain V. L. Cottman, arrived at
Guam from Majiila on January 1 and
sailed from there at 5 p. m. on Febru
ary 1, having coaled the Bennington
and participated In the flag-raising
ceremonies. By the Brutus Commander
Taussig sent the following letter, dated
January 30, to Major H. A. Bartlett of
this city:
We had good weather throughout the
passage and arrived in Port San Luis
d'Apra in Guam on the 23d. I found the
Brutus here and will send her to Hono
lulu by the Ist of February, carrying this
letter.
There was no flag flying over the island
and as the Government had assumed con
trol of the island I. as the senior officer
present, made our paymaster the collect
or of the revenues, such as they
are. and will direct the hoisting
of the flag on the Ist of February on
the Government building. The treasury
is empty, but I believe that the employes
have all been paid up to the Ist of Feb
ruaryâat least some of them have.
The island is about twenty-seven miles
long and averages about seven or eight
miles wide. It is high in most places.
The soil is good. The main article of
commerce is coora. Some coffee and
cocoa also are raised, but labor is scarce,
although there are nearly 10,000 inhabi
tants on the, island. They send to Japan
for sugar, such as it is. but little can be
bought in the place. The beef is not fit
to eat. A laborer is paid 25 cents a day
if he is fed and 50 cents a day if he Is
not. There are very few Europeans. I
have seen seven or eight priests and three
or four Spaniards. There are a few half
breeds who speak English. Many of the
natives do not speak Spanish, but most
of them understand it. Their language.
Chammoro. has many words evidently of
Spanish origin. There are a number of
chickens on the island, the price having
gone up nearly double since our arrival.
Wakes Island is a low atoll from eight
to twenty feet high, covered by brush,
bushes and some trees. It is fringed by
a coral reef, whose outer wall is nearly
vertical, and I could find no anchorage.
I was disappointed In not being able to
take our boats into what is marked afl
an entrance to the lagoon. There was not
enough water throughout the day. The
bare edge of the rpef was out of the wa
ter as the breakers receded. I did, how
ever, succeed in making a landing, when
a flagstaff was planted and we hoisted
our flag, which was saluted by twenty
one guns from the Bennington.
Captain Cottman of the Brutus says
that all the stories of revolt in Guam
against the United States authority fol
lowing the departure of the Charleston
were pure fiction. Everything was quiet

ONOMEA SUGAR STOCK.
Hawaiian Company to List It OB
'Change in San Francisco.
HONOLULU, Feb. 21.â Advices from
San Francisco are that Edward Pollitz
has not yet disposed of the Onomea
stock he purchased while here a short
time ago. He is waiting until permis
sion is given by the government to the
company to reduce the par value of its
shares from $100 to $20 and increase the
number of shares from 10,000 to 50.000.
The application of the Onomea Sugar
Company to the government is for leave
to reissue its stock at the par value of
$20 a share instead of $100, and to have
five times as many shares. The propo
sition is not to increase the capital
stock, the owners believing it is cap
italized for about the right amount.
The proposition is simply to decrease
the size of each share and to corre
spondingly increase the number of the
shares.
It is the intention to list Onomea on
the San Francisco Stock Exchange.HIS HOLINESS
POPE LEO XIII
IS TAKEN ILL
It Is Denied at the Vatican That
the Indisposition of the Pre=
late Is Serious*
ROME, Feb. 28.â The Pope was taken suddenly ill this
morning.
... The Pope had a fatiguing day yesterday receiving congratu
: lations on the approaching anniversary of his coronation and
complained of the cold, which has been intense for two days.
Dr. Lapponi found some fever and ordered the patient to re
main in bed and take a complete rest. The physician has since
visited the Pope three times. It is almost certain that the Ponti
fical receptions, fixed for March 2 and 3, will be countermanded.
Dr. Lapponi will sleep at the Vatican to-night. He de
clines to give any statement as to the Pope's condition. Dr.
Mazzoni has also visited the Pope professionally during the day.
Callers at the Vatican have found everything in the usual con
dition there, and all inquiries were met with the denial that the
Pope's indisposition is serious.
His Holiness rose this morning at 1 1 o'clock, but Dr. Lap
poni insisted on his returning to bed, as he was suffering from
: fever following a general chill, with pains in the lumbar region.

; .solution of the mystery surrounding the
disappearance of the butcher's -wife, made
â  what they for a time believed -was a sen

of the stove were found what appeared to

was at once advanced that Mrs. Becker's'

the refuse nothing but pieces of charcoal.
Nearly every foot of the prairie in the

DR. JORDAN'S THEORY
HELD BY HISTORIANS
Principle of Natural Selection Ap
plied to the Rise and Fall
of Nations.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 28.â
Dr. Jordan has received a letter from Dr.
E. A. Ross, who is spending his year's
leave of absence in study in Europe, in
which he calls attention to the fact that
historians on the other side of the water
are beginning to make use of the prin
ciple of natural selection, which President
Jordan has expounded in this country, to
explain certain great historical phenom
ena.
"Otto Seech," writes Professor Ross,
"in his work. 'The History of the Dp
cadence of the Ancient World.' .claims per
verse human selection was the cause of
mediocrity in later Greece and cowardice
in later Rome. This selection consisted in
the slaying or exile of all the better and
abler men in the Greek cities during the
sanguinary struggles between the popular
and the aristocratic parties. In Rome the
proscriptions of Marius and Sulla, joined
to the Mood-letting of the emperors, ex
terminated the most courageous, so that
congenital cowardice became the char
acteristic of the decadent Romans."
These arguments are almost identical
with those which Dr. Jordan has been
urging against militarism. By taking the
best men â¢out of the country for purposes
of war, the race, he claims, will in time
degenerate as have the Latin races of
Europe from this same steady drain on
its best blood.

NEW YORK, Mafch Lâ At 1:30 this
morning Dr. Dunham, in attendance on
Rudyard Kipling, issued a statement
in regard to Mr. Kipling's condition, in
which he said he was not discouraged.
"Mr. Kipling:," he said, "is better in
one sense and worse in another. We
hope to be able to issue a more favor
able bulletin in the morning."
On being asked as to what he meant
by this, Dr. Dunham said that he could
not explain, but physicians would un
derstand. It is taken to mean that Mr.
Kipling has not yet passed through the
crisis of the disease, but that probably
the crisis will be reached before the
next bulletin is issued.
NEW YORK, Feb. 28.â The following
bulletin was issued at 11:10 to-night:
Mr. Kipling, on the whole, has not
gained a iring the day, though the res

i that the use of oxygen is no longer neces
sary The influence of the persisting in
: flammatlon in the upper lobes is still

THEODORE DUNHAM.
It was said that Mr. Kipling's lung
area available for breathing was at its
minimum on Sunday night. It was in
creased considerably yesterday and
still more this morning. With this im
| provement the danger of coma and de
i lirium passes away and hopes for re
! covery are increased. There is reason
j to believe, according to the statements
! that come from the sick room, that the
clearing put of the lower lobe of the
patient's ' right lung will continue
steadily and breathing will become
so easy by the end of the tenth day of
Mr. Kipling's illness that, unless a re
lapse occurs, his recovery is only a
matter of time.
Dr. Conlin, the Kipling family phy
sician at Brattleboro, Vt., is now in at

Mrs. Kipling this morning sent the
following note downstairs:
Mrs. Kipling wishes to acknowledge
with grateful thanks the many letters

GLOUCESTER. Mass., Feb. 2S.âCap
tain William Corkum of the fishing

Moravia, Captain Ferguson, which
Failed from Hamburg, for Boston, Jan

The Moravia was making her last trip
for the Hamburg- American line, as she
had been sold recently to the Sloman
line of New York. She was almost
three weeks overdue, and it was
thought that the delay was owing to
some trouble with her machinery.
The steamer carried a cargo of gen
eral merchandise, mainly for Boston
firms. Both vessel and cargo were in
sured. She had a crew of about thirty.
The Moravia was an iron vessel of 2141

VOLUNTEERS MAY
STAY IN COLONIES
The President Wants to See Ameri
cans Settle the Philippines
and Cuba.
WASHINGTON, D. C Feb. 28.âTo
day's Cabinet meeting was uneventful.
As usual the Colonies furnished the
chief topics of discussion, but only de
tails of minor interest were gone over,
with the exception of the mustering out
of volunteer troops in the Philippines
and the transportation to the islands
of regulars to replace them. The lat
ter subject was discussed at some
length, the President desiring the ad
vice of members of the Cabinet as to
the most desirable route.
Now that warm weather is approach
ing it is believed it will be more desir
able to send troops by way of San
Francisco, instead of taking the East
ern route through the Suez canal and
the Red Sea.
Secretary Hitchcock, who Is familiar
with the climate in that part of the
world, called attention to the extreme
heat through which troopships would
have to pass If the Eastern route were
taken. By taking that route ships are
compelled to cross the equator and
spend several weeks in the belt where
the climate is intensely hot. By tak
ing the Western route transports would
consume less time in the voyage and
the trip would be much more comfort
able for the soldiers.
It was finally decided that the West
ern route would be chosen and steps
will be taken immediately to provide
more transports. There is a scarcity
of ships now at San Francisco, but
more will be chartered.
The situation in the Philippines was
discussed in a general way and the
President expressed his gratification at
the way the campaign has been con
ducted. According to the statements
of members of the Cabinet after the
meeting the question of probable com
plication with foreign powers was not
touched upon, neither the President nor
any of the members of the Cabinet be
lieving there is any danger of such
trouble arising.
In reference to the muster out of vol
unteer troops in the Philippines the
President has on foot a project which
he is anxious to have carried Into ef
fect if it is in accordance with the rules
of the War Department. That is, that
any members of the volunteer army
who wish to take up their residence In
the Philippines or the West Indies may
be mustered out there, without having

McKlnley and others are of the opinion
that a great many soldiern will have

the violent gales of February 12 and 13,
sighted the wreck and stood by watch
ing for signs of life, but failing to see
any proceeded on her course to the fish
ing grounds. Later Captain Corkum
reports that the schooner Hattie A.
Heckman of Gloucester also had seen
the wreck and had sailed entirely
around it, watching for life, but the
steamer apparently was deserted.
Captain Corkum says that when he
met the Arbitrator Captain Spinney in
formed him he had been in close to the
bar during the day of the 12th and 13th,
and when the storm abated he started
for the fishing grounds. It was then that
he ran across the Moravia, She was
broken in two and the seas were beat
ing- heavily against her. Captain
Corkum says it was the opinion of him
self as well as of the captains of the
Arbitrator and Heckman that the
chances for the escape of the Moravia's
crew in such a storm as prevailed on
February 12 and 13 were very slight.
colonies if inducements could be of
fered to American citizens to remain
there.
The question was submitted to the
judge advocate general of the War De
partment several days ago, and is still
being considered by him. It is proba
ble that some arrangement will be
made whereby those soldiers who wish
to remain in the Philippines will be
mustered out there by their command
ing officers and not be required to re
turn to the United States.
DAMAGE WANTED
FOR BRITONS SLAIN
LONDON, Feb. 28.â The Manila Rail
way Company has received a cable dis
patch from Manila, dated February 27.
saying the railway has ceased working
as a means of public conveyance, the
Americans using the line to convey
troops to Caloocan. The railway was
not damaged by the recent fires.
In the House of Commons to-day
Hon. Philip Stanhope, Radical, asked
the Government whether attention had
been called to the British subjects at
Manila, and whether the circumstances
there were such as permitted friendly
representations to be made to the
United States to procure pecuniary
compensation for the families of those
whose lives were lost.
Mr. Broderick, representing the For
eign Office, replied that the British Con
sul at Manila had reported the fact
and would doubtless furnish a full re-
port, when the Government would be
able to decide what course to take.
The Filipino agent In London says he
has received advices that Hollo has
been burned. These advices further
state that the Filipinos at Cebu have
only retired to the hills at the request
of the foreign residents to avoid bom
bardment of the place by the Ameri
cans, the foreigners promising to in
tercede with the Americans in behalf of
the Filipinos with a view to getting
Filipino rights respected.
AMERICAN COMMISSION
ARRIVES AT HONGKONG
HONGKONG, Feb. 28.â The Ameri
can commissioners appointed by Presi-
dent McKinley to investigate conditions
in the Philippine Islands arrived to
day.
They are the guests of Consul Gen
eral "Wildman. and when informed of
the action of President McKinley in re
storing to the Cortez family the estates
confiscated by the Spaniards, expressed
their pleasure over such a diplomatic
move on the part of the American
Government.
"I believe," said Professor Schur
man, "that this one act will do us a
great amount of good. It will give the
lie to Aguinaldo and undoubtedly win
over to our side the more intelligent of
the Filipinos."
A strong anti-American sentiment
exists here because of the attitude of
Vocal newspapers, which give much
space to false stories of the alleged in
humanity of Americans. These stories
undoubtedly emanate from the Philip
pine Junta here, and have more or less
effect upon residents. The Junta is- ac
tive and well supplied with funds, and
is endeavoring to enlist European ad
venturers hanging about Hongkong.
COWARDICE SHOWN
BY A SHIP CAPTAIN
Abandons His Vessel in the Only
Available Boat, Leaving the
Crew to Its Fate.
DARTMOUTH, England, Feb. 28.â The
British steamer Garton, Captain Willis,
from Brunswick via Norfolk for Bremen,
arrived here to-day, having on board the
second officer and six of the crew of the
British bark Galatia, Captain Lewis, of
St. John, N. 8.. which sailed from Turks
Island with salt for Boston and was re
ported February Â»S to have been aban
doned, water-logged and dismasted.
The Galatia was deserted on February
15, at which time she was in a sinking
condition. Previous to that the bark had
experienced terrible weather and had be
gun to leak rapidly. On February 15 Cap
tain Lewis, the chief officer, the steward,
stewardess and three seamen left her in
the only remaining boat, the others hav
ing been stove in during the. gale. The
boat was lost sight of in a furious gale,
and the second officer considers it impossi
ble' for her to have weathered the storm.
The same evening the Garton hove into
sight and took off the remainder of the
crew of the Galatia at a great risk. The
high seas running prevented the boat
launched by the Garton from approaching
the bark, so the men on board the latter
donned cork jackets and were hauled
through the water.
Captain Lewis, according to the second
officer, took with him all the provisions
and left the remainder of the crew on
board the sinking ship, although, he adds,
there was room for all in the boat, which
hung about the bark until 1:30 p. m. and
then rowed off.

DIRECTORS YIELD
TO DEPOSITORS
Union Bank Officials
Will Resign.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 2S.â The directors of
the Union Savings Bank will resign at
once at the request of the stockholders
and depositors, and thus save themselves
from being unceremoniously ousted. They
gave the stockholders this assurance this
afternoon, and at a meeting to-morrow
afternoon they will hand in their resigna
tions.
The stockholders held their most im
portant meeting this afternoon. They pro
posed to meet in the bank, but the ac
commodations were not sufficient, and an
adjournment was taken to the Good Gov
ernment League Hall. President \V . H.
Wright presided. Most of the directors
were present. About 200 stockholders, rep
resenting 7490 shares, attended.
President Wright made a statement of
the bank's affairs. According to him the
bank was in good condition, and, aside
from Howard's indebtedness, he declared
all securities were good. He reiterated
his statement that depositors would be
paid dollar for dollar, and this from the
assets without the aid of assessments.
The stockholders did not take the same
view as the president, and they would be
willing to present their stock to Wright.
C. P. Braslan, who was lately elected
director, also declared the bank solvent.
He read a long tabulated statement show
ing that after the Bank Commissioners
had scaled down the assets $487,911 there
still remained $709,561, which was more
than sufficient to pay the $658.694 due the
depositors.
Director Bowden followed with a like
statement. He said the directors would
get a dividend out of the institution after
its debts were paid.
These statements were excepted to by
the stockholders. The meeting became
noisy, a half dozen stockholders trying
to talk at once.
A resolution calling for a committee to
Investigate the business affairs of How
THE EMPOBIUM. ___
ard was adopted. It was intimated that
Howard had hidden some of his assets.
E. Eaton. G. \V. Tarleton and J. W. Rea.
were named as the committee. It was
said the directors were trying to shoul
der the responsibility for the failure on
Howard and an attempt was made to
amend the resolution by calling: for the
resignation of all the directors. Presi
dent Wright ruled the amendment out of
order.
A resolution asking the directors to re
sign was introduced but riot adopted.
President Wright- and Director Bowden
both said they would resign if given time
and asked the stockholders not to gn
about it in such a manner.
It was said Attorney General Fitzger
ald had expressed the view that the di
rectors could not fill any vacancies on
the board, now that the bank was in the
Commissioners' hands. The only thing
that could be done was that the direct
ors resign and the names of those select
ed for the places be given to the Judges
of the Superior Court having charge of
the matter.
President Wright and other directors
present assured the stockholders they
would resign. The directors will meet
a committee from the stockholders to
morrow. They will then resign, and men
from the stockholders will be selected for
their places. A motion was adopted that
F. W. Potter be selected as a director to
represent the depositors.
The Howard creditors met to-day and
took steps to preserve their interests.
According to Howard's sworn bankruptcy
statement, he had about $30,000 worth of
dried fruit stored in the Sorosis Fruit
Company's warehouse. The Sorosis Com
pany now claims this fruit and has been
selling it. It claims it bought the fruit
fr-.^n growers,, but admits Howard had
some demands on it. The creditors intend
to look into the matter and see who owns
the fruit. J. W. Blauer, A. Frlant and
Jacob Mirier were appointed a committee
for this purpose, with power to act.
FOUR MILLIONS
LOST JO CALIFORNIA
WASHINGTON. Feb. 28.â The "omni
bus claims bill" has finally been agreed
upon by the conference committee. The
Senate conferees receded from their
amendment providing for refunding the
California, Oregon and Nevada war
claims, because the House conferees posi
tively refused to yield. Thus the State,
of California loses nearly $4,000,000, Oregon
$335,152 and Nevada $404,040. The Califor
nia and Oregon claims were defeated out
right, but Nevada's claim was referred
to the Treasury Department tor a reoort.

ONE MORE VICTIM.
L) ERNARD WARD is in jail charged with the
\ en t of a sum of money approximat-
ing $40,000. He is there because of a mania for
tered and possibly created by the race
track and its adjunct, the poolroom.
When the frenzy for betting seizes a man it often
means ruin. In ihe excitement of the game his
moral senses become deadened. He must have money,
whether it is his own or he is forced to borrow
or -â¢ . 1 :: matters nothing to him.
ird had been trusted with the control of the
tHe Marine Firemen. There was a check on
â¢ the extent that when he wished to draw from
another signature besides his own was
. it would appear that he had no difficulty
in procuring this signature To what extent there
sion is a matter yet to be developed.
The fact already plain is that Ward became a
criminal, stole, betrayed trust, scattered the money of
his friends, and th?.t the gamblers got it. It went
to the tracks and to the "bookies." With a hardi
hood seldom equaled even among wanton trans
gressors, this young man looted the treasury and
worse than wasted every stolen cent. He did not
even derive material good from it. It went to feed
and clothe the tout and the turf speculator. It went
to sustain the tracks which cost this city daily
isands of dollars, which make a mockery of sport'
and a jest of fairness, thrive on dupes like Ward and
give the community no return.
Add Ward to the long list. Give him a place with
i. Widber, Norton, Wclborn and the rest. He
if a victim of the races. There have been others,
tl re will be more. The racetrack men have a pull,
and, unhampered by conscience, they exercise it.
TriE COMING ISSUE IN ENGLAND.
IT is noted by the London Chronicle as a signifi
cant fact that while the debate on the address of
the Commons in response to' the recent speech
from the throne turned upon the important questions
of China, church and land, it was upon the latter
that the Government came nearest to suffering defeat.
The discussion was raised by a motion to add to
the address the clause: "And we humbly express our
regret that there is no indication in your Majesty's
gracious speech that measures will be submitted to
this House dealing with the ownership, tenures or
taxation of land in towns.'' Against the motion the
Ministry carried the Commons by a majority of but
thirty-four, the smallest majority it has ever had on
any important measure.
The supporters of the amendment demanded three
reformsâ an increased power of compulsory acquisi
tion of land on the part of municipalities, reform of
rating, and the imposition of an increased share of
municipal burdens upon the owners of lands. In the
course of the '.lelxite it was pointed out that under
the existing system of tenure and rating in Great
Britain vacant land is being held up around the big
towns without contributing a penny to the rates. The
owner is simply speculating for a rise precisely as a
man speculates who makes a corner, in wheat. If he
ns to own houses in the town so much the bet
ter for him. The more closely he can beleaguer it
the higher his rents will be. for the greater the crowd
the greater the rent. The process is being exploited
[] it is worth.
Commenting upon the debate and the strong sup
the amendment against the Ministry
< Chronicle says: "The ratepayers' power of pay
ing !<>r improvements, of setting the housing acts in
motion and of buying out landlords at a fictitious
valuation is not inexhaustible. Why not convoke a
national meeting of repre>entntives of. municipalities
md urban boards to call for the rating of ground
values? The narrow escape of the Government shows
that this prc^t social question is alive, and we hope
will press that moral home."
This and similar incidents of late show that the
Liberal party in Great Britain is on the verge of
pting a radical platform that will carry it far in
the of state socialism. The party is just
i ow in great need-of both n programme and a leader.
It is probable it will find the first in the demand of
the people for the reforms embodied in the discussion
to which we have referred, and the leader will doubt
less be forthcoming in due season.
While iht- Chief Inspector of Chinese is not satis
fied with the order for his dismissal, a belief that the
.; formulated with a view to satisfying
him has quite a respectable following.
It is safe to say that the anti-cartoon bill will not
go into effect sixty days after its passage. Nor any
o'hcr time.
THE PARTY OND THE SENATOR.
THE first consultation between Republican mem
bers of the Legislature simply developed that
Burns is not the choice of the party, and that he
alone stands in the way of making that choice. It
was further developed that not even his own backers
dared declare that his election would be indorsed by
a party victory in the State next year.
Republicans are aware that the party has a major
ity, and a large one, in the next Senate though all the
States yet in deadlock should leave vacant the seats
that are being contested. Nebraska, Delaware, Penn
sylvania and California can leave theif four seats va
cant and not affect the party's interests in the Senate
of the coming Congress. It is felt by the best sen
timent in the party in Delaware, Pennsylvania and
California that the only peril ahead is in the election
of Addicks, Quay and Burns.
The party here took high and manly ground last
year in affirming its independence of railroad in
fluence and its firm purpose to justify the confidence
which it asked the people to give it. No voter in its
ranks suspected for a moment that any of its candi
dates were bound by any private obligation or prom
ise which was out of line with that position. It was
an unpleasant revelation that such secret obligations
had been assumed by any one who sought votes by
taking a public position exactly opposite to the pri
vate bargain.
That it was the intention of Burns that these se
cret obligations should be secretly discharged, under
cover of a caucus,, is now plain to all who will fairly
see the situation. The party's great prize was to be
drawn blindfold, and its bestowal was arranged in a
manner repugnant to the party's wish and will and
destructive to its future. Seeing this, the best repre
sentatives of the party refuse to sanction the secret
discharge of personal obligations by the legislators,
which, known and made public before election,
would have defeated the party last fall. This is the
inexorable logic of the situation. From it there is no
escape. Let men think for a moment. If the candi
dacy of Burns were so revolting that to have made
it public would have brought party defeat, what is to
be expected next year if that candidacy is now suc
cessful through the secrecy of a caucus ?
Instead of becoming reconciled to it the party is
more in rebellion against it now than when it was
first made public last December. None of its objec
tionable features has been mitigated or softened.
They have all been heightened and emphasized.
The persistent attempt of the Southern Pacific
Railroad to give the lie to the party's solemn declara
tions has roused the feeling of resistance. There is
no desire to make reprisals against that corporation
by any policy of annoyance or injustice, but there is
a firm determination to show that it is not the die-
tator of the Republican party of California.
â  That party met and vanquished the united forces oi
sandlotism upon its declaration that the charge of
railroad domination of its action was false. Surely
it is ill requital of a manly fight and a great victory
for the railroad to push Burns and so file public
proof that what the sandlotters said was true!
In our judgment, which is that of every good prin
cipled Republican in the State, there is one way only
i-i which the party can file a claim to future confi
dence and can deserve future success, and that is by
the defeat of Burns, even if it involve leaving the seat
unfilled. We are perfectly well' aware of the threat
that is out. that if this is done the railroad will avenge
itself by helping the Democrats carry the State next
year. The way to this revenge is already open in the
apparent alliance between Burns and the Examiner,
and therefore between that paper and the railroad.
But Republicans must not forget that we won the
last election by solemnly pledging the people that the
party was not under the suzerainty and control of the
railroad, and we can win the next only by making
that solemn pledge true.
Let the railroad and Burns go to the enemy if they
wish. They cannot do it and escape detection. Their
secret agreements in this Senatorial contest have all
been exposed, and a secret treaty cannot escape pub
licity.
We hold it to be the right of a Democrat in the
railroad company to vote his party ticket, and of a
Republican to do the same. But we deny the right of
the railroad, regardless of party principles, to throw
its whole weight to any party to secure its own cor
porate advantage or to wreak corporate revenge.
Let the Republican party refuse now and forever
the ratification in its name and through its instru
mentality of any secret bargain or the discharge of
any secret obligation, and its lease of power will not
terminate. It can lose in the future only by subject-
ing itself to base uses now.
fIN EXPENSIVE LUXURY.
ACCORDING to a report from Sacramento the
Legislature has up to date sent to the Gov
ernor for his approval seventy bills. Of
these Mr. Gage has approved thirty and vetoed seven
teen, leaving twenty-three still under consideration.
Ihe total number of bills introduced at this session
in 1532. This includes the number proposed in both
houses, a large percentage of which are duplicates;
that is to say, the same bill has been introduced into
each House at the same time â a device invented for
saving time. Place the duplicates at one-half the
grand total of measures introduced â which is a liberal
estimate â and we have at least 750 separate proposi
tions submitted for enactment.
The printing and reprinting of these bills, together
with the daily files, daily journals and daily histories,
has already cost the State upward of $100,000. The
expenses of the Legislature itself, will probably
amount to $150,000. The pay of the members ceases
to-morrow, but the pay of attaches and employes and
the cost of running the State Printing Office con
tinues on until the end. It is a conservative estimate,
therefore, to place the total cost of this session of the
Legislature at $250,000, and it is extremely probable
that that sum will be greatly exceeded. For this vast
expenditure of money the people have so far got
thirteen new laws, with a prospect that the Governor
will approve ten or twelve of the twenty-three now in
hands. - .
Mr. Gage is making an enviable record as a vetoer
of crude, ungrammatical. ill-considered and imprac
tical legislation. He has already struck down three:
or four gigantic jobs introduced and enacted by the
tax-eaters. Among these measures was a bill to es
tablish a Harbor Commission for San Diego and a
bill designed to increase the force in the office of the
Supreme Court Clerk. At this date it is said that the
Legislature should have in the Governor's hands
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1899.
from 150 to 200 bills, and it is predicted that even
with protracted night sessions, which will continue
from this time until adjournment, not more than two
or three hundred of the measures now pending can
be put through.
But it is not clear that the public is going to be
benefited even if the work of the Legislature was up
to date and the usual number of new laws had been
ground out. Governor Gage h> sitting down hard
upon nearly every measure which comes to him. If
he does not object to its grammatical construction he
complains that it is full of holes or makes an appro
priation of too much money. Even if the Legislature
should adjourn with three or four hundred bills in
his hands, there is no prospect whatever that he will
approve more than twenty-five or thirty of them.
The Governor under the constitution has ten days
after adjournment in which to consider measures that
have passed. Bills which he does not sign during this
period fall dead. There are a few important mat
ters before this Legislature, and if the others or the
greater portion wind up in Governor Gage's, waste
basket probably little or nothing will be lost. But,
nevertheless, the people will disburse for the privi
lege of convening this session upward of $250,000.
Everybody remembers Ben Franklin's story of the
boy who paid too much for his whistle. The privi
lege of having a biennial session of the Legislature
is a very dear one, but unless we are mistaken the
people are paying too much for their whistle.
WHAT EXPOSITIONS ACCOMPLISH-
EVEN the most casual study of the results at
tained by great expositions in the United States
is sufficient to make clear their value to wide
regions of territory and to the most diverse interests.
They have never failed to attract the attention of
capitalists and home-seekers to the advantages of the
country surrounding the exposition city, nor to
stimulate all forms of its enterprise.
The effects of expositions can be discerned more
easily in the Southern States than elsewhere because
the people of that section lack the capital and the
skill to establish manufacturing industries and have
been compelled to rely upon outsiders to furnish
them. What has been accomplished in the develop
ment of the South is therefore almost wholly due to
the advertising value of the expositions held at At
lanta and at Nashville.
The extent of the deficiency of banking capital in
the South was shown by the statistics of 1890. At
that time the average for the Union was $93 67 per
capita; but while Massachusetts had $341 for every
man, woman and child, New York $299, and other
manufacturing States a similar amount, the banking
capital of North Carolina was but $9 62 per capita;
South Carolina, $12 70 per capita; Georgia, $10 09
per capita; Alabama, $7 37 per capita; Mississippi,
$10 57 per capita; Arkansas, $4 86 per capita.
The deficiency in skilled labor was about as great
as the deficiency in capital. The South had no con
siderable body of factory workmen, nor any men of
means who knew how to manage such establish
ments. Therefore, when the falling price of cotton
compelled the people of that section to seek other in
dustries than those of agriculture, it was imperative
upon them to obtain both the capital and the skilled
labor from outsiders.
In the emergency they undertook to advertise their
resources by means of expositions. A small venture
in. a tentative way was made in the first cotton ex
position at Atlanta, and the results were so success
ful that a much larger exposition was opened in the
Fame city a few years later. Then came the exposi
tion at Nashville, and the opportunities for invest
ment in the South were fully made known.
The results have been so extraordinary as to con
stitute one of the most notable features of our in
dustrial history. The influx of Northern capital and
skilled labor has been such that the South is now a
strong competitor with New England in the manu
facture of cotton, and with Pennsylvania and Ohio in
tile production of iron. So rapid is the growth that
the Southern trade papers publish every week a state
ment, of the new manufacturing enterprises started in
their States, and the result is always a handsome
showing.
For example, a recent issue of the Chattanooga
Tradesman says: "Among the more important new
enterprises reported by the Tradesman for the week
ending February iS are a bobbin mill in West Ten
nessee; a brick and clay works in East Tennessee;
brick and tile works in East Texas; a canning fac
tory in East Tennessee; a $100,000 cotton mill in
Texas, and a $(xx>,ooo one in North Carolina; elec
tric light plants in Kentucky, North Carolina and
Virginia; an extract manufacturing company in
Southwest Virginia; a flouring mill and a harness
factory in Georgia; an ice factory in Arkansas; iron
works in Virginia; an irrigation company in Florida;
a $50,000 leather company in East Tennessee; a $100,
--000 lighting and heating company in Louisiana; two
lumber companies in Texas and one in West Vir
ginia: a machine shop in Kentucky; a tannery in
Middle Georgia, and a telephone company in Texas."
These are the results of expositions held in a sec
tion of country without capital and without skilled la
bor. It will be seen that while the expositions were
held in but two cities, the stimulus of their influence
is t'elt over the whole region from the Potomac to the
Rio Grande. Can Californians require any better ob
ject lesson in the value of expositions or any more
conclusive proof that an exposition in San Francisco
would be of beneficial, effect throughout the Pacific
Coast and to all forms of its interests? 1

RANCH AND RURAL LIFE
For a long time there was noted in this country a tendency to leave
rural life and seek the cities. In consequence every census since out civil
war has shown a great increase in the percentage of city population, me
Eastern press now notes a reversal of this tendency. Men reared in cities
are seeking rural life and the congestion of population in the cities is i not
going on as rapidly. It is a wholesome sign and the movement should
encouraged. ..

THE ROAD TO DEFEAT.
The road to defeat is a curious road,
Nobody thinks he walks there-
Yet all day long a motley throng
Pushes and crowds and stalks there.
â¢ Some are Deople of brain and wortn
Who have wearied of Truth's long highway;
In the breathless race after riches and place
They sought for a short-cut bywa>.
And others have stumbled and missed the road
And wandered off into Sinningâ seemed lost. â¢
When they counted the cost the way seemed lost.
Back into the right beginning. oYin] , . Â -
Some loiter through meadows of "Time-enough,
Somerush through the gates of Hurry-
Some seek the defile of "Wait-awhile"
And others the field of lurry.
There are many old women. and many old men
Who think they are wise as sagesâ
And In paths of Defeat tread, too, the feet
Of children of tender ages.
They follow the motto of "Do as you please.
They scorn to be led or guided;
And all kinds of work they hate and shirk,
And they cannot endure to be chided.
Out from the valley "Pretty-s6on"
They straggle along at leisure; -
They tumble and drop from the mountain top
Of â elfish and idle pleasure.
Oh, a very queer road is the road to Defeat,
Where the people are all so knowing-
Yet never a soul knows the name of his goalâ
Now. is this the way YOU are going? WHEELER WILCQX

description it is an annual. The fleshy petals about the seed pod are used
for jelly which much resembles currant jelly and is highly prized. It bears
all summer. Mr. Shorting has seed for distribution.
The Merced Sun says that twelve carloads of sweet potatoes remain to
be shipped from the Bubach switch and Atwater, which will close out
the season's crop there. The shipments for 1899 are expected to reach 300

cents a sack, so that a carload is worth $264. Shipments this year have
been made to Portland, Ore., for which $28 a ton. was paid.

JUDGE COFFEY ACCUSED
OF BEING PREJUDICED
TROUBLE OVER THE ESTATE
OF JTTLIA MORAGHAN.
Transfer of Probate Proceedings Is
Sought but Promptly Denied
by Judge Daingerfield.
An affidavit, accompanying a motion to
transfer probate proceedings in the estate
of the late Julia H. Moraghan from Judge
Coffey's department of the Superior Court
to Judge Troutts, was filed yesterday be
fore Judge Daingerfield, and in the affi
davit the first named jurist is charged
with unfairness and partiality. The trou
ble is the culmination of a division of the
Moraghan family, two of the children of
the deceased. Elsie and James, dissent
ing over the right to general letters of ad
ministration.
On the 6th ult. Elsie Moraghan applied
to Judge Coffey tor letters of administra
tnon. At that time James was out of the
city, but upon his return he also filed ap
plication for letters of administration.
His attorneys got his application assigned
to Department 10, and as this divided mat
ters they appeared before Judge Dainger
field yesterday and asked that the entire
matter be placed in the hands of Judge
Troutt. . .
In support of the motion for a transfer
an affidavit was read setting forth that
James could not hope to receive an un
biased hearing before Judge Coffey.
James Moraghan had known Judge Cof
fev for two years, it was stated, and they
were not on the best of terms Further
more during the settlement of the M. B.
Moragh'an estate. Judge Coffey is accused
of having said of James Moraghan:
"Charles seems to be always working
industriously, while James seems to be
industriously doing nothing."
On these grounds the transfer was asked,
but promptly denied. Consequently the
matter will be heard by Judge Coffey,
SAi"S HE WAS ROBBED.

WORLEY TRIED
TO FRIGHTEN
TWO OFFICIALS
Accused an Official
Stenographer.
ATTORNEY WAS REBUKED
HEACOCK DID NOT BELIEVE
HIM UNDER OATH.
Scathing Roast by the United States
Commissioner of a Lawyer Who
Tried to Land a China
man Illegally.
Attorney Alfred S. Worley madr an un
seemly exhibition of himself yesterday
morninK in United States Commissioner
Heaooc-k's court room and in the corridor
outside after a case had been decided
against him.
Mr. Worley" Is a young man, a fault
easily mended in time, and he has a very
violent temper. In the words of the
sporting fraternity he is not a "good
loser." In the same dialect he doesn't
know when he is "up against it."
His latest venture in the field of law
has been the advocacy of the admission
of Chinamen who claim to be native
born Californians, and therefore eligible
to the office of President of the United
States. Last December, the exact date
being the 7th., the Chinese Bureau re
fused permission to one of his clients to
land. When Worley was informed of the
decision he frothed at the mouth and in
the sacred preceincts of the Chinese Bu
reau, where he had no right to be, he
accused Inspector Gardiner of having
perjured himself as an interpreter ami
challenged him to step outside into the
corridor and fight. Dr. Gardiner, being
a minister of the Gospel, declined tha
challenge and paid no further attention
to the fool challenger.
Yesterday Worley swore in United
States Commissioner Heacock's court
that Walter D. Hoyt, the official sten
ographic reporter of the bureau, had per
jured himself when he testified that his
notes and his transcript thereof were cor
rect on a very material point.
Mr. Hoyt took the stand and swore that
his notes and transcript were correct.
Rev. Dr. John Endlcott Gardiner corrob
orated-Mr. Hoyi's testimony and declared
that the perjury, if any, lay with Mr.
Worley. Worley then introduced a cross
eyed Chinese barber â name unpronounce
able and therefore immaterialâ who
swore that Wong Si Fun had testified be
fore the Chinese Bureau that Worley's
client lived in a house on a level terrace
of a Chinese village built on a hill.
Judge Heacock asked the witness from
the transcript of testimony all the ques
tions asked, and all the answers were
given by Wong Si Fun at the bureau ex
amination. The cross-eyed barber proved
to be a hoodoo for Worley, for he swore
that all he remembered of the testimony
was that Fun had testified that the vil
lage was on a hillside on a level lane.
Judge Heacock, in rendering his decision
remanding Mr. Worley's doubly unfortu
nate client for deportation, said that Yea
Hooey Hook, his witness, had been "in
jected" into the case; that he was clearly
a perjurer and tnat the Commissioner at
tached no credence whatever to bis testi
mony. The court regretted to announce
that he did not believe Mr. Worley's testi
mony under oath.
At this stage of the proceedings Worley
seized his hat and was granted permission
to withdraw from thp room, which he did,
the action being regardpd by the spec
tators as eminently disrespectful.
Judge Heacock said that Stenographer
Hoyt and Dr. Gardiner were public offi
cials, disinterested and faithful in the
performance of their duties, and that he
would believe -them 365 days in the yearâ
or words to that effectâ in preference to
AVorley. who was working for a fee.
Worley remained outside the corridor
waiting for Gardiner, Hoyt and Lynch.
When Hoyt made bis appearance Worley
began to 'abuse him. charging him with
having committed perjury. Hoyt laughed
at him and did not notice him sufficiently
to reply. Then the vials of the baffled
I attorney's wrath were turned upon Dr.
Gardiner.
"I know that man's record, he shouted,
"and I'll expose it. He testified . falsely,
and so did Hoyt."
United States Attorney Foote laid his
hand upon Worley's shoulder.
"Mr Worley. I am a friend of yours,
said Judge Foot?, "and I want to give
you a piece of advice. Don't make a fool
of yourself. I want to warn you that the
attempt to intimidate a tedoral official
is a crime and that you will get into
trouble if you persist."
Worley walked away, followed b> the
hoots and jeers of the bystanders.

companied by the refrigerating steamer
Iris. The collier Scindia will come to San
Francisco as soon as her boilers can be
fixed up to make the voyage practicable.
It will be remembered that while on the
way from Callao to Honolulu the crown
sheets of the collier's boilers gave out,
which necessitates her coming to San
Francisco for an overhauling instead ol
accompanying the Oregon to Manila.
A peculiar mishap occurred at an at
tempted launching in Kobe, Japan, the
other day. "It was one of the most ex
asperating things I ever heard of," said
one of the officers of the Gaelic yester
day. "The steamer Taigen Maru had
been completed at the Kobe shipyard and
was all ready for launching. A big party
of invited guests were present and en
joyed an elaborate luncheon provided by
the builders of the vessel. Speeches were
made, wine flowed and everybody had a
good time. Then the guests went out on
the platform to witness the launching.
"The bottle of wine was broken and the
vessel duly named as the shores were
knocked away, but the Taigen Maru re
fused to move. While the guests were
enjoying the banquet, the grease on the
ways had frozen and the steamer wa*
held as though in a vise. The day we
left Yokohama another attempt wad made
to launch her."
Tht^ Australia brought from Honolulu
forty-seven cabin passengers anil seventy
two in the steerage, of which thirty
eighl were convalescing soldiers and six
discharged soldiers. Head winds werÂ»
mtered all the way up.
Captain Hoover of the German bark J.
C. Pfluger is bewailing the loss of a car
rier pigeon that was the net of every
body aboard. The bird had quite a his
tory, and the captain was in hopes that
he might takr- it hark to i Europe with
him. The Pfluger left Bremen for Ho
nolulu on June 30, 1898. When a fort
night out and when the vessel was
Abreast of the English channel in lati
tude 48 degrees 25 minutes north, longi
tude 7 degrees 54 minutes west, the pigeon
came aboard in a storm. It was tir^d
and made no effort to escape, so Captain
Hoover took it to the cabin and gave it
into the care of his wife. There were
other pigeons aboard and during the voyÂ«.
age the carripr became very friendly with
them. After crossing the equator it T>f
fan to molt, and when its wing feathers
rapped out Captain Hoover noticed that
two of them were Ftamped with indeli
ble ink. On one was "156 U. T." and what
looked likp "Maguile," while on the other
was "ol H" and what looked like "Or
mand." These two feathers are all that
'Captain Hoover now has to show for the
pigeon.
At Honolulu the carrier was admired
by everybody who saw it, and when the
Pfluger arrived here and went to the
Fugar refinery a number of pigeon fan
marlo the journey to South San
Francisco in order to get a look at the
bird. A few days ago the pigf-on disap
peared. It was strutting around the deck
with i's plebeian companions when the
crf-w went to dinner. On their return the
carrier waa gone.
The river sfamer Captain "Weber broke
down on her Monday night run to Stock
ton, and it will take over a month to get
her ready to go back on the route again.
In the meantime the Union Transporta
tion Company will have to get along the
bc^t way it can with the Dauntless alone.
The Captain Weber left Cla.y street wharf
at 5 p. m. for Stockton with 160 passen
gers aboard. Shortly after passing The
Brothers her shaft broke, and she had
to be anchored. The breaking of the shaft
1 a great shock, and some of the
passengers thought the vessel had run on
a rock. Half an hour later the California
Navigation and Improvement Company's
steamer Mary Garratt came along, and
the captain of the Weber blew a distress
signal. The Garratt went^alongslde the
disabled steamer, took her passengers off
and carried them to Stockton. Yesterday

THE CONQUERING OF
A CONQUERING HERO
Â® "T TERILT, the troubles of S. C. Rowley, turfman, sport and all-around Â®
Â® 1/ Â£Â° o<i fe l low . are legion. It Is said that about three weeks ago Mr. Â®
.-. y Rowley, by an unfortunate move, broke a looking-glass while the Â®
w * moon was at its darkest. This was the beginning of trouble. Â®
Â® That same night he went out. The story of what happened has already Â®
Â® been told in these columns, but for the enlightenment of those who might Â®
Â® not have read, or having read, fall to remember, let it be told briefly Â®
Â® that Mr. Rowley went out the night of the breaking of the looking-glass Â® '
Â® while the moon was yet dark and met a friend, A. H. Rowland. Mr. Row- Â®
Â® land told Mr. Rowley that he had a friend with him that night, one Dolly Â®
Â® Martin, and that they proposed to have one of those times which cause a Â®
Â® man to wake up with a large brown taste in his mouth. Â®
Â® Mr. Rowley at once felt lonesome. He had money, but no friend, and Â®
Â® started out to find one. He was successful in his â¢ search, and finally Â®
Â® brought Into Rowland's room a Miss Kingston, two thirsts and several Â®
Â® bottles of beer. There were drinks all around; then, according to Mr. Row- Â®
Â® ley's story, all was a blank. The next morning he awoke with a thirst, a Â®
Â® head and no money. He visited police headquarters, told his story to the Â®
Â® Chief and procured a few warrants. Â®
Â® Much to Mr. Rowley's discomfort, however, he learned that the mills of Â®
Â® the gods grind slowly and the wheels of Justice in San Francisco slower Â®
Â® yet, so, forgetting that looking-glass and the dark moon, he started out to Â®
Â® take the law in his own hands. Â®
Â® The start was made Monday night, at which time the moon was no Â®
Â® longer dark. It was full and so was Mr. Rowley. He learned from Â®
Â® friends that Mr. Rowland was in the Pabst cafe, keeping the bartenders Â®
Â® busy. A crowd of sporting men and race track touts stood in the door- Â®
Â® way watching the flitting forms of the airy fairies, and to these Mr. Row- Â®
Â® ley told his troubles. He also made the statement that a grease spot would Â®
Â® soon occupy the portion of the barroom floor occupied by Mr. Rowland, and Â®
Â® with this announcement started In to conquer. Â®
Â® Those who remained on the outside smelled a little sulphur, heard a Â®
Â® crash, and rushed In to find the noble and valiant Rowley lying stiff and Â®
Â® senseless on the floor. . Â®
Â® This was the signal for a free fight, and then and there ensued a scrap Â®
Â® that put the historic fight of the Kilkenny cats so far In the background Â®
Â® that it will never be heard of again. Some one made the statement that Â®
Â® Rowley had been kicked In the head, and .everybody joined in the melee. Â®
Â® Tables, bottles and chairs were used as weapons, and there was many a Â®
Â® bleeding face and black eye this morning to tell the tale. Two members of Â®
Â® the police force were present, but no arrests were made. Â®

THE SAX FRANCISCO CAI/L, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1899.
CRIMSON CLOUDS
HANG OVER THE
POPULIST CAMP
Purifying the Purity
Committee.
SCATHING MAJORITY REPORT
GILLESPIE AND KINNE COME IN
FOR A SCORING.
They Are Accused of Disbursing the
Candidates' Money With
Lavish and Lawless
Hands.
Every day the war cloud hovering over
the local Populist encampment grows
blacker, and ever and anon a flash of
lightning shows along the edges of the
lowering mass. The parties at issue in
the turbulent company appear to be the
campaign and purity of elections commit
tees one one side and the rest of the camp
on the other. The commltteemen who
have incurred the ire of their political
brethren are George D. Gillespie, A. B.
Kinne. B. J. Pye, Henry Huppert and M.
Meakin. However, Gillespie and Kinne
came in for the major share of the party
reprobation.
The trouble in the ranks went merrily
on till Gillespie and his confreres demand
ed an investigation of their alleged politi
cal misdeeds. An Investigating commit
tee, consisting of G. A. Hubble, chairman,
George A. Clough'.Dr. W. N. Griswold,
Dr. J. A. Miller and Aaron Wasch, was
appointed. They soon brought in a
voluminous majority report, which, it is
claimed, was successfully sidetracked by
Gillesple et al. The report In question ar
raigns Gillespie, Kinne, Pye, Huppert and
Meakln of the Purity Committee with
having unauthorizedly disbursed the funds
of the party. It says in part:
"The balance of the $1894 collected, being
$1684 or thereabout, was paid out by the
members of the Purity Committee without
warrant and in violation of law, whenever
and fur whatever, and in such amounts as
served their plundering purposes. Their
own report states that from $1000 to $1500
was turned over by themselves
to themselves for salaries and
wages and pretended compensation
to the Voice of Labor and the Home
Printing Company. Mr. A. B. Klnne
rakoi in from $500 to $700 as compensation
for work that .should have cost the can
didates not more than $200, if, indeed. It
should have been ordered or was worth
anything to them. Mr. (iillespie raked off
$150 as two months' compensation for ser
vices, though the campaign lasted but one
month, and he was at the same time in
the open and avowed employ of the State
Executive Committee as Its secretary.
Messrs. Pye and Meakln. being of the
committee, were employed by the com
mittee at wages higher than wages hith
erto paid by the People's party, and Mr.
Huppert received a moderate salary for
holding the bag and permitting his con
freres unrestricted access thereto."
The report then calls attention to the
fact that such unauthorized disbursing of
the candidates' money is punishabk- by a.
fine not exceeding $1000, and by irniTi-
onment not exceeding live years, or by
both. It also states that under the Civil
Code of California a trustee must not
deal with trust property for his own
profit or for any other purpose not con
nected with the trust, and such trustee
must not use his positron to attain any
advantage from his beneficiary, and such
acts are frauds against the beneficiary of
the trust. Then the report continued:
'"According to the records and facts
known to ail, Mr. Kinne appeared Brat
as a member and chairman of the aud
iting committee, and therefore as trus
tee under the law for the candidates; sec
ond, as owner of the Voice of Labor; and
third, as owner or part owner of the
Home Printing Company. They show
that, as a trustee, Mr. Kinne, by con
tracting with himself at one time as own
er of the Voice of Labor, and at
another time as owner of the Home
Printing plant, by charging prices great
ly in excess of prices usually charged for
like work, by printing and publishing
matter, which, owing to the limited cir
culation of the Voice of Labor, could be
of little or no use in promoting the elec
tion of the candidates of the Peo
ple's party, by inaugurating Pouti
cal expenditures chiefly in his line or
business which, by any disinterested par
ty of sound mind, would have been en
tirely rejected or. greatly decreased m
extent and amountâ by these means c.d
â¢use and deal with the trust property for
his own profit'; did take part in trans
actions concerning the trust ('with an in
terest adverse to that of his genencia
ries')- 'did use the influence which his po
sition gave him to obtain advantage
of his beneficiaries. Mr. ivinne is mere
fore under the law propeny chargeable
with fraud against the beneficiaries of
the trust whicn he had undertaken.
"The law also holds some v if not all the
other members of the auditing commit
tee for the fraud, because they confut
ed to the wrongful acts of their co-trua-
â¢â¢The conspiracy furthermore entered
into the invention of what was known us
the caucus committee,, which met every
evening during the sitting of the conven
tion. Its duties were to slate the candi
dates to be nominated at the night meet
ing- of the convention. It afforded an ad
ditional opportunity for work-on the anx
ieties and pockets of candidates, which
rumor alleges was profitably improved.
Through this committee a guarantee or
nomination could be given to candidates
for a proper consideration.
"Thus these busy bees in the political
hive of the People's party went in and
out and out and in from one commutes to
another, arranging the action of the con
vention, determining the measures of inÂ©
campaign and turning the tides of honey
into their own little buckets.
"The campaign ended, this same ban 2
of conspirators undertook to cover up Its
past doings and prepare for future politi
cal work by an organization of the coun
ty Committee, with themselves in the
controlling offices thereof.
"As members -of the candidate and pur
ity committees, these men raked in the
money, and as members of the auditing
purity committee they stood by :t until
the last dollar was gone.
"That an attempt was made by the con
spirators to secure exclusive control of
the twenty-two or twenty-three hundred
dollars and to set aside and contrary to
law to usurp the superintending and di
recting functions of the executive cam
paign committee is evidenced by a vague I
motion introduced by Mr. Gillespie Oc
tober 14. as follows: 'The purity of elec
tion committee be empowered to arrange
for halls and other expenses during the
campaign." As the law expressly deftnos
the duties of the auditing committee on
one hand and the executive campaign
committee on the other, and their proper
relations, such a resolution, however dis
tinctly it might have been expressed,
could afford no proper pretext whatever
for the almost complete usurpation of
powers that followed.
"Mr. Kinne nominated a comparatively
unknown member of the party, supposedly
controllable by the gang, as chairman.
Mr. Huppert was nominated by Gllle.s
ple as financial secretary. Mr. W'asch,
a faithful adherent of this com
bine to the last, nominated Mr. Pye
as recording secretary. Messrs. Gillespie
and Kinne held back for themselves re
spectively the chairmanship and secre
taryship of the to-be-elected executive
committee. The two committees thus
manned, it was probably thought would
form a solid bulwark against an possible
investigation of political acts which were
known to be both' criminal and fraudu
lent."

gate.
The Police Commissioners may be asked
to Investigate the conduct of Policeman
P. A. McNamara in connection with the
arrest of August Molrath, son of the
keeper of a lodging house at 609 Howard
street, and Thorn ton Morris, a sailor, early
on the morning of February 21. Molrath
was charged with interfering with an of
ficer, and Morris with disturbing the
peace.
The case against Morris was disposed
of the following day, but it was not till
yesterday that Molrath's case came up
for hearing before acting Police Judge
Groezinger. McNamara testified that he
heard a disturbance in the house and the
breaking of glasses, and when he went
Inside he found Morris, drunk and rais
ing a row. He placed him under arrest,
whereupon young Molrath attempted to
take Morris out of McNamara's clutches
and he was also arrested for interfering
with an officer. Policeman J. Donovan
corroborated McNamara's testimony.
The testimony for the defense was to
the effect that the disturbance had taken
place five hours before the officers en
tered the house, and when they came In
Morris and young Molrath were shaking
dice. McNamara asked Morris if he was
getting robbed, casting a reflection upon
the proprietor, and then placed Morris
under arrest. Young Molrath protested
and McNamara struck him a violent blow
on the head with his club, knocking him
down. Mrs. Augustine Molrath the
young man's mother, then interfered and
she was hit in the eye with the end of
the club. She had been confined to bed
since and two doctors had been attend
ing her. She was able to come to court,
but after giving her evidence was so weak
that she had to be carried out of court
and placed in a hack.
Judge Groezinger continued the case un.
til to-morrow, as there are other wit
nesses to be heard. Attorney Bert Schles
inger who represented the defendant, in
timated that he would file charges against
McNamara before the Police Commission

' GENERATED IN THE HUMAN BODY.
â  . . .
i The Result of Imperfect Digestion of
Food.
Every living thing, plant or animal, con-
tains within itself the germs of certain
decay and death.
In the human body these germs of
I death (called by scientists Ptomaines) are
usually, the result of imperfect digestion
of food, the result of indigestion or dys-
pepsia.
The stomach, from abuse, weakens,
â¢ does not promptly and thoroughly digest
the food. The result is a heavy, sodden
mass, which ferments (the first process of
I decay), poisoning the blood, making it
thin, weak and 'lacking in red corpus-
cles, poisoning the brain, causing head-
! aches, pain in the eyes.
Bad digestion weakens the heart, caus-
ing palpitation and" finally bringing on
disease of this very important organ.
Poor digestion poisons the kidneys,
causing Bright's disease and diabetes.
And this is so because every organ,
every nerve, depends upon the stomach
alone for nourishment and renewal, and
weak digestion shows itself not only in
loss of appetite and flesh, but hi weak
nerves and muddy complexion. .
The great English scientist, Huxley,
said the best start in life is a sound
stomach. Weak stomachs fail to digest
food properly, because they lack the
proper quantity of digestive acids (lactic
and hydrochloric), and peptogenic prod-
ucts. The most sensible remedy in all
cases of indigestion is to take after each
meal one or two of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, because they supply in a pleas-
ant, harmless form all the elements that
weak stomachs lack.
The regular use of Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will cure any form of stomach
trouble except cancer of the stomach.
They increase flesh, insure pure blood,
strong nerves, bright eyes and clear com-
plexion, because all these result only from
wholesome food well digested.
Nearly all druggists sell Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets at 50 cents full-sized
packages, or by mail by Inclosing price to
Stuart Company, Marshall, Mich., but ask
your drupeist first. A little book on stom-

THE ADVANCE IX TIN.
Dealers Predict a Rise of More Than 20 Per
Cent in Canned Goods.
The New York Commercial says: "Leading
dealers in canned goods when Interviewed on
the subject of the probable effect upon the trade
of the recent advance in the price of tin ex- j
press the opinion that the goods already
packed will not be affected.
"Regarding the effect upon future business."
Raid one prominent dealer, "there can be no
doubt that the increased cost of tin will en
hance the value of the manufactured article, j
and so add to the cost of the various products, i
The advance will amount to more than 20 per )
cent and I understandthat some, manufacturers i
of tin cans have been obliged to pay as much :
already. Some people have confused the re- [
cent advance in the prices of sardines due to ;
.a natural and healthy condition of the market |
with the rapid rise in tin. It has nothing to
do with it. nor do I believe the increased firm
ness of the other canned goods can !>â¢â  traced to
the higher prices of raw tin. There may be !
some truth in the statement, however, that
stocks of tin cans already manufactured are
held at prices to correspond with the rise in
raw material.
"A !0 pÂ«r cent advance coming all at once
naturally encourages all sorts of rumors, but
while the effect will be telt more or less by the |
packets, the consumer in the'end is the only j
one who pays it. I do not think there wjll be I
fewer canned goods packed, unless, which is
extremely unlikely, the supply of raw material
jives out entirely. The demand ftir canned ;
goods is increasing year by year, and a few \
cents additional to the cost of a can of goods
going to interfere materially with tho
consumption."
PACIFIC COAST VESSELS.
The Commercial News has Issued its regular
11st of vessels owned on the Pacific Coast and
in the Hawaiian Islands. It is in convenient !
â  rm and contains the description of over ;
raft from sloops and scows up to deep
water ships and steamers. For those interested j
Jn shipping it is a valuable publication.
The statement of tonnage for IS9B is as fol
lows: Tonnage removed from the 11st. 34,505;
to the Hat, 88,666. Net gain for 1898, 54,
--268 tons.
NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial says of dried !
fruit nnd raisins: "Peaches have not been j
In as strong position for -years, if they were j
ever there before. The present lotal supply, I
BO far as is known, is not more than 20 per j
cent of last year's supply at this time. High
prices will cut down'^teonstiinption somewhat,
but probably not more than SO per cent. That
is. while consumption may be reduced one- |
half by unusually high prices, the supply has
decreased four-fifths, as compared with pre- j
vious years. It is considered that, though i
prices are '.cry high now, tney will go higher.
The reason given Is that people want peaches,
and there are no substitutes. They must have
-. or they must go without the variety
of fruit they want. Th* consequen'-e is that
while there will undoubtedly >>>â¢ a mu^h j
smaller demand than usual, owing to the
higher range of values, the restriction of high |
wIU not be sufficient to prevent the
*al* of everything now known to exist in all
hands.
"Apricots are scarce, but probably there are j
larger supplies than there are of peaches, j
Cani.ers were enabled by a series of favorable
circumstances to secure the bulk of the crop. |
6b, while the dried apricot is at a premium,
the canned sort is as plentiful as usual. Quo
tations rule high on all desirable grades, and [
Show advancing tendency. Dealers anticipate
active demand, and a bare market when spring I
trade begins, which Is likely to occur shortly, j
"Prunes opened steady at previous figures,
and there was a moderate demand for medium
Sizes. Large sizes are eagerly sought, while
mediums are somewhat neglected. Buyers are i
being forced by circumstances to take them, j
but they demur as long as possible. There
are few left on the coast in any hands, though
buyers say they are having no difficulty in
Fitting all they want if they are willing to
pay the price.
"Raisins are unchanged. Demand is light;
supplies are ample for all probable require- i
ments. and trade is upon a narrow basis, with
no Indications or broadening."

of the possibility of tighter -call money and on

news. The Atlantic port clearances of wheat
and flour were, equal to 651,000 bushels. The
market continued firm, but 74c seemed a.n

against those figures several times, but was

CALIFORNIA CITRUS FRUITS.
NEW YORK, Feb. 2R.â The Journal of Com
merce says: Notwithstanding the large arrivals I
of Sicily lemons during the past week or ten !
days, the fact that there had not been anything
received for a week previous and that Interior
buyers had been unable to get orders filled in â 
consequence of the blizzard and zero weather :
| during the first half of the month, had a stim- j
ulating influence when at last mild weather j
admitted of free shipments, and on all sales of '
j the week very good prices, by comparison with ;
! those obtained at the corresponding season in !
past years, were obtained. It Is stated on good
authority that in 1897, when the total receipts j
for the season to March 1 amounted to about i
I 560,000 boxes, prices at the end of February
ruled from about $1 to $2 at auction sales. In
the following year receipts for the season to
March 1 were in the neighborhood of 365.000 '
boxes, but in that year the West had a g0c..l â 
i supply of California lemons to draw upon to :
i make good the deficiency in receipts of Sicily I
| fruit. This year for the season to March 1 the i
prospects, according to the same authority, are j
[ that we will have a total of about 690.000 boxes, I
but there were no Californias to speak of. At I
this time last year prices at auction were In
the neighborhood of $1 7592 75, and recent auc
tion sales have been at a range of about %2 10@
1 70 as to quality.

were better to-day with Liverpool futures also
higher. Considering that what little has been

the export value, an advance or decline in the
foreign . market does not affect matters much
locally. Sixty cents was quoted for Walla
Walla, and buyers In the Palouse country paid
I equivalent to 61% cm Portland, but as a limited
amount only could be worked at that price the
figure would hardly do for an accurate quota
tion. Valley Is nominally 600 and Blue Stem

THE STOCK MARKET.
The resumption of pumping sent the shorts
on the mining stock market to cover, and the
bulls ran prices up on them. Business was
brisk in consequence. Profit taking set tn, !
however, and the market eased ofC again, as
will be seen by the sales.
Fluctuations In local securities were nar
rower and fewer. Mutual Electric was weaker
and Gas and Electric advanced to Â§S5. Ha
waiian Commercial was also firmer.
The report from the pump yesterday was as
follows: "The pump was lowered into piaee
and all important connections made. Will start
pumping again this afternoon. Water is twen
ty-seven feet six inches below the 1750 revel."

per share, delinquent April 1.
The Best & Belcher and Gould & Curry Min
ing Companies are preparing to resume deep
work through the Osbiston shaft, which t|?y
Jointly own, as soon as drainage operations ire
fully under way.
Work Is to be resumed in the Eureka Consoli-"
dated mine, in Eureka district, Nev. The com
pany has let a contract to Hacking St
Eathorn of Ruby Hill to run a drift on the
eighth level. The main drift on that level Is
caved, and as It runs over an old chamhber the
ground would settle were that drift cleaned
out. The new drift will run around tho caved
part and will explore gome new and promising
ground.
The connecting drift between the Savage
mine and the main Sutro tunnel is being
cleaned out for the purpose of catching up and
conveying such water as is now flowing to the
lower levels into the tunnel drain boxes.
In the Chollar-Savage-Norcross combination
shaft the water now stands at a point forty
six feet eight Inches below the station on the
level of the connecting drift with the Sutro

Heavily Played Horses
Ran First.
THREE OF THE CHOICES WON
JOE MUSSLE A VASTLY IM
PROVED HORSE.
San Mateo Finished. Ahead" of Ed
die Jones â Montanus Turned
Up a Clever
Winner.
The betting ring at Oakland track yes
terday experienced some very rough
weather. The barometer betokened a
change :n temperature, and the bookmak
ers were first to feel it. Three heavily
played favorites won, and three other
horses that were not first choice scored;
also backed to a standstill. The fields
â¢were well classed and the betting was an
improvement over the first day of the
week.
There were no' really startling surprises. :
Sidelong began by taking the first
number on the card. As good as 6 to 1
"was laid against the gelding, and Turner
landed him first a length before Schnitz. '
the favorite. Merry Boy commanded
strong support, but was unfortunate in
being pocKetrd nearly the entire distance. ;
The Montana colt Montanus outclassed
the crowd opposed to him in the sprint j
that followed, over the Futurity eourso, j
and at odds of 6 to 5 won easily from Sir
Urlan. Jerry Hunt, the heavily backed
second choice, failed to get inside the !
money, finding the route too far.
Sloan & Hurst seem unable to land a
purse with Dare 11. The hooded horse
closed favorite for the mile and a six
teenth run, decided under selling condi
tions, and after showing prominently to
the stretch ran third. Under Bullman's '
strong urging Joe Mussle, the second ,
choice, disposed of the rank outsider Per-
Bonne by a length.
The fourth event furnished a run over
me distance, but with a much bet
ter class of horses starting. Ro.sinante
ruled a pronounced favorite with Turner
In the saddle, w-ith Espionage a well-fa
vored second choice. The favorite m;ide
one of her phenomenal stretch runs, get
ting to the stand two lengths in advance
of Wyoming. After leading until a tin
long from home Espionage had to be con
tent with third position. Wheel of For
tune ran very disappointingly.
Everybody backed the brown horse San
Mateo to win the seven furlong event and
he did. Going to the barrier a S to 5
chance Rutter soon had him in front,
and with little to spare at the finish
crossed th<* line a couple of lengths ahead
of Eddie Jones. Midllght was third.
El sin, backed from 7 to 4 to 1, captured
the last event in a hard drive from Una
Colorado. The favorite, Eakins, ran un
placed after Bhowing first to the stretch.

ton responded and saw Sutton running
through a lot adjoining the house. They
started in pursuit and soon overtook him.
They returned to the house and found

window. He said he was drunk and did
not know what he was doing.

CLAMOR FOR
THEIR HARD
EARNED COIN
Wheelmen After Ken
nedy's Scalp.
DID NOT FULFILL PROMISES
SENSATIONAL AFTERMATH OF
THE SIX-DAY RACE.
Shocking Stories of Cruelty Inflicted
by an Avaricious Manage
ment â Arrest oÂ£
Kennedy.
Dissatisfaction and indignation are rife
In the ranks of the six-day bicycle rid
ers, their trainers and the numerous con
tingent of ushers, doorkeepers, etc., who
were connected with the hippodrome that
was recently inflicted on the public.
The riders are clamoring for their pay,
and are lustily complaining of the bad
faith displayed by the men who brought
them from the chilly East to toil around
a board track for the edification of a
curious and uncharitable public. The
trainers, who spent nights of ceaseless
vigil encouraging their men to renewed
exertions, are loud In their demands for
the amounts due them.
Believing in the promises of "Jim"
Kennedy, fight promoter and general as
sistant to William A. Brady in the farce
just enacted, that he would settle their
claims yesterday, they all collected in the
corridor of the Columbian building and
awaited his coming. They were com
pelled to stay in the corridor, as the sup
posed "headquarters" of the American
Cycle Racing Association were uÂ»fur
nished and locked. For hours they longed
for Kennedy's coming, but they were
doomed to disappointment. Long after
the time fixed for the meeting he sent
word that he would pay the numerous
claims at Corbett's poolrooms to-day.
Fournier, whose exhibitions on his "In
fernal machine" was a feature of the
meet, was among the crowd that waited.
He, like the other riders who competed
in the races, was loth to say anything
disparaging of the management, fearing
that his transportation to the East would
be withheld out of revenge. Not so the
trainers, who are local residents. Before
that disgusted and disappointed contln
i gent left the building they told of broken
i agreements and gave instances of brutal
| treatment on the part of Brady and Ken-
In the six day race," said one dis
gruntled trainer, "Pilkington was guar
anteed $50 If he rode 1500 miles or over.
At 3 o'clock Sunday morning he had rid
den the stated distance, and as he had no
chance to land inside the money Barnaby,
who held eighth place, being sixty miles
ahead of him, his trainer, V. Shafer, went
to Brady and asked him if his man would
receive anything for continuing. He was
pointedly told that he would not, where
upon Shafer informed Brady he would
take his man off the track. Brady threat
ened to have him thrown out of the building.
Shafer ordered Pilkington from the track,
but later in the day the fatigued rider
returned to the grind, fearing he would
lose his transportation home.'
Another of the many tales told by par
ticipants was to the effect that In the
early part of the twenty-four hour race
Nawn was afflicted with a swollen ankle
and left the track. It is said that Ken
nedy went to hirt and ordered him to re
turn and pedal a few hundred miles or
walk or ride his wheel back, to New York.
Nawn, still suffering excruciating pain,
obeyed his hard taskmaster, and man
aged to circle the track with one pedal.
The tribulations of Julius, one of the
Swedish representatives. In the six-day
grind were pitiful. His trainer, Frank
Eli the pugilist, departed with Julius
money and clothes early in the game,
while he was snatching a few winks, and
the unfortunate ridtr was left to sleep
ten hours, while his rivals were pedaling
to victory, thus ruining his chances of
landing a prize. He just managed^ to
struggle within the 1500 mile mark but,
like the rest of the losers, has not re
ceived a cent for his exertions. It is
said that during the race Julius had verj
little food, and actually cried in his tent
because of the want of nourishment.
Lawson, "the Terrible Swede," despite
the fact that he did not receive a cent for
hi! hard work, paid his trainer $10 out of
his own pocket. Fredericks, it is said,
was brought from Europe to compete In
the six day race held in New > ork in 1898
He was under contract to ride and had
his expenses paid. The same rosy induce
ments were held out to him to come to
California, and he accepted Brady a offer
He was greatly surprised at the end of
the tournament to receive $400 of the $600
he won for being in third place at the
finish The $200 was deducted to pay hotel
bills and railroad fare here, and now he Is
kicking, as he must pay his trainers out
of the remaining amount.
The hard-working riders complained be
cause McCoy was given $200 for giving a
bag-punching exhibition the last two
nights. They claim he was not a drawing
card and that the amount paid him was
rightfully due the men. who earned it by
loss of sleep and hard riding.
Stevens, who finished first in the twenty
four hour race, said he would not have
competed had he known he was to receive
but $190 for his exertions. Out of that sum
he will have to pay his trainer, and he ex
pects that Kennedy will deduct railroad
fare and hotel expenses.
There are other complaints too numer
ous to mention. Everybody is dissatisfied,
and although William A. Brady has their
confidence, his agent, J. C. Kennedy, is
looked upon as being a breaker of prom
ises. It is Intimated that if he does not
settle the claims due the men and their
trainers to-day there is likely to be
trouble as a number of the latter threaten
to get satisfaction for the loss of sleep
and the hard work they performed dur
ing the meet.
Kennedy was arrested yesterday on a
warrant sworn to by William J. Ryan,
better known as "King" Ryan, charging
him with misdemeanor embezzlement. He
was reFeased on a $500 bond. Ryan was
Aronson's trainer. He tried to collect $50
from the latter for service*; rendered Ar
onson, who won second money. Aronson
informed Ryan that Kennedy had with
held that amount from his prize money,
and Ryan had the rider arrested, but the
court dismissed him. Ryan then appealed
to Kennedy for the money, and as the
latter refused to turn the amount over
Ryan had him arrested on the above
charge on a complaint sworn to before
Judge Mogan.
BAN ON LONG FREIGHT CARS.
New Order Issued by Southern Pacific
and Santa Fe.
The Southern Pacific and Santa Fe com
panies have issued an order to the effrct
that they will no longer handle freight
cars exceeding forty feet in length. This
is the result of the annoyanco and trouble
created by such cars in the making up of
trains. Another objection to their use is
that it puts shippers who have no need
of the longer cars to considerable disad
vantage. The order will apply to all
shipments except to and from Portland,
Tacoma and Seattle.
The Valley road directors held their
regular meeting yesterday afternoon, but
beyond signing certain bills and a desul
tory talk as to the work on the line from
Stockton and Point Richmond and termi
nal facilities no business of importance
was transacted.
In consequence of the resignation of W.
H. Truesdale. first vice president and
general manager of the Chicago, Rock
Island and Pacific Railway, Second Vice
President H. A. Parker succeeds Mr.
Truesdale as general manager. The new
appointments are: H. Gower. assistant
freight traffic manager, Chicago; E. B.
Boyd. general freight agent for lines east
of "the Missouri, and H. H. Embry. late
commercial agent at Buffalo, gf-neral
freight agent for the lineÃ west of the
Missouri. No changes are contemplated
in the Pacific Coast appointments.

IRVING M. SCOTT TALKS
OF NATIONAL DESTINY
UNITED STATES MUST HOLD THE
PHILIPPINES.
Speaker Declares We Are Committed
to a Policy of Territorial Expan
sion â Lecture Illustrated.
Trying M. Scott delivered an interesting
lecture on "Uncle Sam on Land and Sea"
under the auspices of Pioneer Council No.
1 of the Young Men's Institute last even
ing in Metropolitan Temple.
The speaker spoke from the standpoint
of a territorial expansionist and declared
his belief that the new policy inaugurated
by the United States was the first step
toward the national destiny as a great
colonizing power. He reviewed the_his
tory of the country from the t'rst efforts
to plant colonies on our shores by Eng
land and other countries of Europe and
dwelt upon the tyranny under which our
forefathers suffered at the hands of their
oppressors until they broke the chains
that bound them and set up a republic
of their own, which has since become
glorious He reviewed the history of the
United States, including itÃ various wars,
and gave a short resume of the incidents
leading up to the recent contest with
Spain which resulted in our suddenly tak
ing our plate among the colonizing na
tions of the world. The lecture was illus
trated with stereoptioon views and the
lecturer concluded with a short discus
sion of the kind of government to be es
tablished in the Philippines, which are
now a part of our domain and must be
held by us.

Solomon Kusel Defends Himself
Against His Wife's Con
tentions.
Solomon A- Kusel, tba aged capitalist,
who has been made defendant in a suit
for non-support of his wife, Caroline, was
on tho witness stand yesterday explaining
to the court the quality and quantity of
the meals -with which he used to provide
his wife. All day long Kusel and others
talked about bread and butter, mush for
supper, boiled beef served hot two days
and the third cold, and so on. The case
Is peculiar, as well as the defendant. He
does not claim the meals were of the best,
but contends that if they were good
enough for him they were good enough
for his wife. Solomon also avers that his
wife was bad and stayed out late, very
late some nights as late as 11 o'clock, and
did not toll him where she was. This talk
will continue until the court cries hold
and decides the rase.

PROSECUTION
IN BRANDES
CASE RESTS
Defendant's Attorneys
Make Charges.
TALK OF POLITICAL PULLS
DR. WOOLSEY WILL OPEN FOR
THE DEFENSE.
The Skull of the Dead Girl Will Be
Exhibited, but the Accused
May Not Go on the
Stand.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Feb. 28.
The best part of four weeks has been
consumed in the trial of William A.
Brandes. charged with brutally beating
to death his 13-year-old daughter. The
trial commenced on February 7, and the
greater part of the time has been occu
pied by the defense in the cross-exami
nation of medical experts called by the
prosecution.
Late this afternoon, after Drs. Hoag
land, Shannon. Whltworth and Eastman j
had given testimony the prosecution an- i
jounced that the State rested its case.
The testimony of these physicians was \
almost Identical with that given hereto- j
fore by Dra. Buteau, Rowell arid others.
Questions usked by Borne Â«t the jurors;
have facilitated matters and have dem- ;
onstrated the unusual interest taken In |
se by the Jury- The experts called
by the prosecution have all testified that
Lillian Brandes died of meningitis,!
i by blows \ipon the head with some |
heavy, blunt weapon, and not by hang- j
me- 'that thp marks found on her neck |
were probably made through the friction i
<.r" a rope, and could not have been made
with an apron, with which the defense
claims the sir! hanged herself; and that
on the day <>f the girl's death she was
physically Incapable of having hanged
Tomorrow morning the defense will
open its batteries by placing L>r. E 11.
Woolsey on the stand, on whom thej
base their greatest hope of tearine down i
what the prosecution has established.
The skull or. rather, the skull cap, of
the dead girl, which was taken from her j
corpse as she lay in the undertaking par
lors at Berkeley, will be exhibited, and
by it Attorneys Bennett and Sawyer ex
pect to prove inaccuracies in the testi
monY of the people's experts.
When Dr Woolsey's testimony has con
cluded Drs. Muller. Pratt. Eaton and
Crowley are to be called, and in this con
nection Attorney Sawyer made a some
what sensational statement this after
noon. He said: .
â¢â I do not know just why it is. but
some person is going around to our lned-
Ical experts and trying to use political m
fluence to null down several of them. \
It is quite Ukelj that the attention of j
the court will be called to the matter. i
The statement that the defense will
place the accused on the stund is provis
ionally denied by Attorney Sawyer. 1 lie
- that this has not yet been de
cided upon. "If we inak. our cas^ strong
enough," he .-aid. "we will submit it to
the jury. We may. however, put Brandes
en the 'stand. He has nothing to conceal, i
If he does not testify, though, It cannot |
be used against him, as he has his choice >
according to law." |
Mrs. Etta Brandes, who is also charged
with murder, appeared in court to-day
and had her case put over for another
week.
CANDIDATES TO BE ARRESTED.
Trouble Follows Their Eagerness to
Get Before the Public.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 28.â 1n their eagerness i
tq get their names prominently before
the people the local candidates have pla- I
carded the town until the fences and!
deadwalla have the appearance of patch
work quilts. The. politicians will ttnd
their method of advertising rather costly,
fur within a day complaints will be sworn
to. charging them with violating a city
ordinance in thus placarding the city. The
maximum penalty is $*.*â¢ fine or three;
months' imprisonment. To-night some of
the candidates are hurrying about town j
tearing down their placards, while others j
are rustling up bondsmen. It is stated
that warrants will be issued for at least
- lif teen of the candidates.

Her Daughter.-
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, ]
908 Broadway. Feb. 28. â 
Notwithstanding Mrs. Martha Lynn tes- !
tified at the trial of her husband that She ,
believed him Insane on February 1, 1893,
â when he fired live bullets Into her body,
Mrs. Mary A. Thompson, her mother, and
other relatives hold decidedly contrary
opinions.
When the trial of J. W. Lynn was re
sumed in Judge Ogden's court this morn
ing the prosecution called Mrs. W. .1.
Roth, sister of Mrs. Lynn, whose testi- j
mony showed that the accused was ex
tremely jealous and that he frequently
quarreled over the most trivial matters.
\V. J. Roth related a conversation that
had taken place between himself and
Lynn on the Saturday subsequent to the
time the accused approached his wife In
Han Francisco while she was in the c-om
mv of another man. "Lynn," said the
witness, "was very angry. Vie said: 'My
<iiÂ«d 1 caught her this time, and I can t
stand this much longer. Something will j
happen pretty soon.' He said thai ais
wile had talked SO disgracefully to him I
on the boat that he jjot up and took Ah
other seat." "â â¢,â â 
Detective Holland, the next witness, tes
tified hat when he called at the Lynn :
residence after the shooting he found
Lynn i ting in a chair with his revolver
in his hand. "When I asked why lie had
committed this act," said the witness, â¢'he
told i.. that God had directed him to do
it." While Holland testified the accused
frequently wiped the tears from his eyes.
The defense then called Mrs. Thompson, i
whose testimony proved quite the reverse ]
of that given by her daughter, Mrs. Lynn, j
She said: I
""I never saw any signs of insanity in
Lynn before he shjjt my daughter. The
man may be excitable, but not insane-. The
night, before the -hooting', at 6 o'clock, he
was perfectly sane. I never did believe
he was Insane."
The defence had expected that the Dis
â  trlct Attorney would move a dismissal,
but the prosecution is still confident that
Lynn's motive was prompted by his jeal
ousy, and that he reigned insanity. Still,
Lynn has twice been declared legally in
sane since I he shooting.
, The trial will go on to-morrow morn
ing and will occupy the remainder of thi?
week at least.

POLITICS NOW
FIGURES IN THE
WATER RATES
I Major Woodward Is
in Evidence.
SOMETHING GOES WRONG
"SOLID SIX" MAY REFUSE TO
STAND PAT.
Probable Scheme to Delay the Fixing
of the Schedule Until After the
Election â Some Very
Shrewd Work.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 28.
Something has gona wrong with the
water monopoly's programme. It is re
ported that the company can no longer
depend on six votes to pass the ordinance
it desires to have passed in order to
strengthen the stock which has just been
thrown on the market by the consolida
tion of the two companies.
As usual Major Woodward is the cen
tral figure, and either the major has ex
perienced a change of heart or else he
is acting a very diplomatic part. He has
lately been circulating cards containing
campaign statements. One of these state
ments is that "water rates should be ad
justed, modified and reduced." When
asked if he meant that which he had
printed, the major replied that such was
his platform and on those issues he in.
tended to go before the people. The major
unfortunately has set a Dad precedent
by which to judge himself. It will be re
membered that prior to the last test made
of his sincerity he gave to The Call that
famous "stringless" interview which
brought him such publicity. One week
from next Monday Major Woodward
comes before the people again as a can
didate, and naturally his campaign state
ment regarding the reduction of water
rates at this late hour is viewed in thÂ«
light of the developments of his string
less" promises a year ago. â ;â¢â â 
There is another view being taken or
this matter. It is said that in order to
save Woodward the monopoly has
brought sufficient influence to bear on the
other live members of the solid six to
defer fixing the rates until after the elec
tion. This is rather a clever scheme, and
taken : in connection with Woodward s
most recent campaign utterances is caus
ing- a great deal of talk. â ..'-â :.
In the Fifth Ward, which the major
would represent, live most of the million
aires of the city, and Woodward s peti
tion contains most of their names. He
declares they are solid for him and is the
most confident man in Oakland regarding
his election. ,
1 The water monopoly at this time de
sires a good water rate, but it does not
desire a row. The one and a half million
dollars' worth of stock just issued is
worth very little, except it can be sold
at something near its par value. I his
cannot be done if investors are frightened
by another such demonstration as oc
curred a year ago.
No matter what move "the six" may
take it will be promptly met by counter
moves from the other five who are al
ready prepared with an ordinance fixing
rates based on a thorough investigation
of the costs of the plant and operating
expenses.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1, 1899.
ALL-CALIFORNIA
FOOTBALL TEAM
TERMED A MYTH
U. C. Men Claim It to
Be a Fake.
NO IDEA OF AN EASTERN TRIP
H. P. TAYLOR DENOUNCED BY
ATHLETIC OFFICIALS.
He Cannot Expect to Take Califor
nia's Star Players East During
the Thanksgiving
Season.
BERKELEY. Feb. 28.â The members of
the Athletic Association of the University
of California are greatly concerned over
the action of a local athlete now in the
East, who they claim is perpetrating a
series of gross misrepresentations upon
Eastern athletic clubs. The person in
question is Howard P. Taylor, well known
in San Francisco. The grievance of which
the college men complain is that Taylor
is representing himself as the organizer of
an All-California football team, to be
formed next season, and that he has al
ready arranged for matches with prom
inent football clubs there, to be played
between October 28 and Christmas.
No objection could be made against an
organization of this kind were it not for
the fact that its self-styled organizer has
announced informally the members of
the team proposed, and they include six
men from California, eight from Stanford,
with the balance from local clubs.
From the dates which Taylor has ar
ranged it can be seen that he expects to
have all of California and Stanford's star
players in the East during Thanksgiving
season. This unwarranted assumption is
now the subject of serious consideration
among the officers of the V. C. Athletic
Association. A special meeting was held
to-day, at which President Reno Hutch
inson, Professor George C. Edwards and
Football Manager Irwin J. Muma were
present. They all three agreed that the
matter was sufficiently urgent to be made
the subject of formal action by the asso
ciation before the misunderstanding on
the part of the Eastern men can. go any
further.
There seems to be no doubt that Taylor
is really doing what the U. C. men com
plain of. for from two letters recently re
ceived from the East the details of his
plans have been made known. One from
Wolf Ransome. formerly captain of the
I. C. team, and now coach of the Du>
quesne Club, asks that his team be given
a place upon the schedule proposed. An
other from Taylor to Pete Smith asks the
latter to use his influence In securing the
college- meVi. Numerous cuttings from
Eastern papers have also been forwarded,
showing the impression to be prevalent
that the organization of the All-Call
fprnia team is a settled thing.
"When seen to-night Manager Muma
said:
"I wish you would say that this busi
ness of Taylor's is all a fake. It is a
very serious fake, tÂ»o, for the idea pre
vails in the East that our men will give
up the time-honored Thanksgiving gam*
in order to show their prowess against
Tale and Harvard. Nothing could be
more misrepresenting than that. We
never had any intention of going outside
the State, and if would be absurd for us
to think of doing so. especially during the
time that Taylor's schedule calls for. I
am constantly receiving letters making
inquiries about this very thing. The of
ficers of the Athletic Association have
talked it over and they intend now to
send out official notices stating that the
California men can take no part in such
an Eastern trip. They deem this neces
sary to insure the success of our next sea
son here on the coast."
MRS. GOOBY HORSEWHIPS
ATTORNEY D. MITCHELL
HOLDS HIM RESPONSIBLE FOR
LOSS OF PROPERTY.
Irate Woman Is Ejected From Her
Victim's Office and Remains on
Guard at the Door.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Feb. 28.
Attorney D. Mitchell had an anxious
hour this afternoon. During that time
he received a* horsewhipping from an irate
woman, and for the balance of that period
he was besieged in his office on Broadway,
near Eighth, with Mrs. Gooby posted out
side his door.
Mrs. Gooby thinks she has a grievance
; against Attorney Mitchell. During the
I past five years the Goobys have had all
; sorts of trouble, including a divorce, 'md
j their property has to a great extent dis-
I appeared. Mrs. Gooby blames it all on
Attorney Mitchell, although she does not
i give any facts upon which she bases her
charge.
The merits of the case, however, cut no
figure in this afternoons pantomime.
! Mrs. Gooby went to the attorney's office
| and proceeded to berate him In langupage
! loud and long. Mitchell tried to pacify her,
but she would not be pacified. She pro
j duced a rawhide, and made a few cuts
I over his shoulders, after which Mitchell
â¢ sent for a police officer and Mrs. Gooby
I was ejected into the hall. Here the offi
-1 cer's Jurisdiction ended, as he had no au
| thority to put her out of the building.
Mrs. Gooby was accommodated with a
i chair, and for a long time she addressed
a score of real estate men on the issues
lof the Gooby campaign. Mr. Mitchell sat
i inside and did not show his head, but
â  every time a paper rustled In his office
; the lady cried out: "If you come out here
i I will knock your face off," and after
having delivered herself of this little
-speech she would take out her handker
chief and very properly have a little cry.
Attorney Mitchell says that all his busi
ness with Mrs. Gooby is perfectly straight
and declares that he will be forced to
have her arrested if she attempts to re
peat the annoyance of to-day. Mrs. Gooby
declares that the attorney is responsible
to her for $4000.
Toward evening some of the tenants in
the building persuaded Mrs. Gooby to
leave. Mitchell also departed as soon as
the siege was raised.
MOURNED AS DEAD.
An Oakland Mother Made Happy by
Her Son's Return.
OAKLAND, Feb. 28.-Mrs. Barrett of
West Oakland to-day received a telegram
from her son, George Barrett, whom she
has mourned as dead for the past four
teen months, announcing that he is alive
and well at Portland. Or., and would ar
rive home in a few days.
The story of the bitter suspense is one
seldom chronicled. For fourteen months
the aged mother had not heard from her
son. The fact is he has been in an Ore
gon prison, convicted of manslaughter.
Barrett had killed a man named t rank
Williams, a gambler, tough and outlaw.
He was accused of murder, bufc the jury
found him guilty of manslaughter. How
ever, -he finally secured a new trial and a
few days ago "was acquitted, the jury beÂ»
ing convinced that he killed Williams
purely In self-defense.
Smarting under the disgrace of the aw
ful charge, Barrett wrote to his two sis
ters about his troubles, but implored them
not to break the sad news to the mother.
The sisters, faithful to their promise,
kept their aged mother in total ignorance
of the facts.
Cochran Heard From.
BERKELEY, Feb. 28.â Irwin J. Muma.
manager of the University of California
footbaJl team, received a telegram to-day
from Garrett Cochran, which leads the
U. C. Athletic Association to believe that
the services of the coach can be obtained
for next year. Thus far Cochran has not
made an affirmative answer to the many
inquiries sent him, but it is understood
that negotiations are now pending be
tween him and Manager Muma and that
some agreement will be reached very
shortly. Cochran's telegram was sent
from Silver City, N. Mex.
Horace Van Sicklen's Leg Broken.
ALAMEDA. Feb. 28.â Horace, the five
year-old son of Mr. and Mrs. F. W. Van
Sicklen, was more seriously hurt in yes
terday's runaway accident than was at
first "supposed. It developed later that
the little fellow's right leg was crushed
below the knee and the small bones shat
tered. â 
REGENTS DISCUSS PLANS
FOR WILMERDING SCHOOL
BUILDING COMMITTEE WANTS
TO SAVE $10,000.
Board Adopts Its Report and Then
Refers Matter Back for an Inves
tigation of a Proposed
New Site.
A special meeting of the Board of- Re
gents of the University of California was
held in the Hopkins Institute of Art yes^
terday afternoon for the purpose of re
ceiving the report of the building commit
tee on the plans for the construction of
the new Wilmerding School of Industrial
Arts. The report, signed by T. G. Phelps
and Ernebt A. Denicke, is as follows:
Gentlemen: â¢ Your committee on the Wil
merding School, to which was referred back
for further consideration the report that your
committee heretofore made relative to the fill
ing of the school lot and the construction of
a building thereon, has again examined the
whole matter and begs leave to amend the for
mer report in regard to the filling of the lot at
this time. Your committee does not desire to
make any change in the building, excepting
that the partition wall for protection against
fire be made of brick instead of corrugated
iron; but suggests that instead of placing the
building on the grade of Mariposa street that it
be placed twenty-five feet back of said street,
twenty feet from Kansas street and one story
below grade. By so doing we can avoid all
grading and filling at the present time. Aside
from a small amount of excavating: that will
have to be done where the building is to stand
no work on the grounds will have to be done
at present. The engine room would be In the
basement, and the building throughout as be
fore proposed. The grade on Mariposa street
is such that an entrance from that street can
be made at the east end of the building and
engine room for the delivery of coal and ma
terial while material to be 'used on the upper
floor can be taken in from Marlposa street.
By adopting this plan the cost of much filling
and the enormous walla for the foundation can
be avoided, saving fully J10.000. .
Your committee Is of the opinion tbat the
building will be quite as convenient for the
uses of the school as it would be if elevated to
the grade of the street, and although it will
not look as well from the south, it will look
better viewed from the city side. Director
Schwartz is of the opinion that the lot can be
graded by the pupils by the time the main
building will be required with a very small
outlay of money. Your committee presents the
plaster casts made by Director Schwartz from
an accurate contour map. One as the lot now is
another showing the building in place, and
another showing the lot as it would appear
W Th n c liians.'in blue print, will be hung upon
the walls of the Regents' room and the speci
fications and estimates herewith inclosed.
Accompanying th? report was an esti
mate of the cost of the. building accord
ing to the plan favored by the committee,
ether with specifications. This esti
mate which would have to be increased
$10,000 if the building were to be raised to
grade, is as fellows:
Excavations, grading and fi11ing........... * 1.000
Concrete foundations and floors and brick
Carpenter work, including all lumber, â¢
mill work, stairs, glass and hardware.. 9.500

Tin and galvanized iron work.... l>o
Painting work â¢â¢â¢â¢ .â¢â¢â '"
Electric bell â¢ '__
Total - Â» 16 - 8151
The report of the committee was adopt
ed, as was also, a resolution authorizing
the letting of a contiact to the lowest bid
der The Regents then went into execu
tive session and "took up the matter of
changing the proposed site of the school
to a lot adjoining the Lick School, sev
eral blocks distant from the present loca
tion Regent Einstein was strongly in
favor of pursuing this course, and after a
long discussion the building committee
was instructed to thoroughly investigate
the advantages of making the proposed
change and report at the next meeting,
two weeks hence. *'
By this action the adoption of the com
mittee's report is practically nullified, and
everything is it a standstill until the
oucstkn of a site is .finally ..disposed of,
which will. probably be at the next meet
ing. ' â¢ :'.'.
AN OLD PLAY
AND A NEW CONCERT
Miss O'Nell In " East Lynne " and
Maurer and Wismer in In
strumental Novelties.
They called it the "New East Lynne"
at the California last night, but it was
still a very Filly and old-fashioned play
and one that gave Miss Nance ONeil
and her company little or no chance for
clever or sincere work. What there was
to be made rut of the piece was perhaps
accomplished by the performers, and
certainly Miss O'Neil won enthusiastic
applause in several of the pathetic cli
maxes. She played the part of Lady Isa,
bello in a straight melo-dramatie key.
without any effort to make the character
more human and logical than it really is,
and the a-idknee accepted it in that vein
with apparent pleasure. No one looked for
real acting or real sentiment in "K;ist
Lynne." Mr. Rankin was robustly good
as the Lord Mountsevern and Mr. Carr
was dellghtfullv malevolent as the arch
Sir Francis, and Mr. Willard was impos
sibly bad as the saintly Archibald Car
lyle. Miss O'Neil wUI appear to-night as
Parthenia In "Ingomar." The rest of the
week will be devoted to the repertory
that has already been announced.
An interesting if rather prolonged con
cert was given in the Sherman & Clay
Hall" last night by two of the younger
local musiciansâ Hother Wisme.r (vio
linist) and Fred Maurer Jr. (pianist).
They were assisted by Frank M. Coffin,
who sang excellently the Arthur Sullivan
settings to a group of Tennyson's poems.
The Instrumental numbers Included
Handel's A minor sonata, Goldmark's
concerto, op. 28. and Godard's concerto,
op. 36 â on the whole a hackneyed pro
gramme played with good feeling and
good sense.
Socialist Lecture.
Rev. S. Goodenough will lecture to
night before Liberty branch of the So
cialist Propaganda Club at Turk street
Temple. The subject will be "Friends
and Foes." The lecture begins at 8.
CAPTAIN TERRY
AND OFFICERS
WERE ABSENT
Thomas Post's Re
ception to Shafter.
WAR VETERANS AT BANQUET
CAPTOR OF SANTIAGO GIVEN AN
ENTHUSIASTIC WELCOME.
He Addressed His Old Comrades and
Feelingly Thanked Them for
Their Cordial and Sincere
Welcome.
The reception extended by George H.
Thomas Post No. 2, G. A. R., to Major
General William R. Shafter and the offi
cers of the battle ship lowa at the Cali
fornia Hotel last evening was a most
gratifying success, despite the fact that
Captain â Terry and his officers were not
present.
The committee of arrangements had in
vited the officers of the lowa and up to
the last moment they were expected. The
banquet was delayed until after 9 o'clock,
hoping they would arrive. Neither Cap
tain Terry nor any of his officers, how
ever, put in an appearance, and what
was worse, they sent no excuse for their
absence.
It is thought by the members of the
post that possibly Captain Terry and his
officers did not receive their invitations,
or that there was some misunderstand-
ing as to the date of the receptfon.
The banquet was held in the main din
ing room of the hotel, which had been
appropriately decorated for the occasion
with flags, bunting and flowers. General
Shatter was attended by his two aids,
Captains Plummer and McKittrick, while
Major Edward Field was also present.
Nearly 200 members of the post were in
attendance. Colonel C. A. Sumner pre
sided at the banquet as toastmaster.
During the banquet, and before the
speeches, the occasion was enlivened by
music furnished by an orchestra and by
several selections which were rendered
by the Plymouth Quartet.
Prior to the speeches A. J. Vining intro
duced Colonel C. A. Summer as the pre
siding officer of the evening..
Colonel Sumner stated that the object
of the reception and banquet was tor the
purpose of extending a welcome to Major
General Shafter. He stated that the post
was glad t9 extend any honor to General
Shafter, as he deserved it, in view of the
past events of national history. This re
mark created wild enthusiasm and clearly
showed that his auditors were men capa
ble of appreciating hard-won victories.
He excoriated the yellow press and its
contemptible? attempt to besmirch General
Shatter's name, and said that nothing
could lessen the high esteem in which he
would be held by the veterans of the late
and civil wars, as well as by every man
who at heart possessed the true instincts
of manhood. â  .
Horace Wilson delivered the address of
welcome to General Shafter. His remarks
were even, concise and polished. In
speaking of the harsh criticism that has
been heaped on General Shafter, he said:
"This is an age of detraction, but to the
veterans of four years' hard fighting, who
appreciate what you have done, the abuse
of the envious counts for nothing." In
closing his remarks he said it was with
the truest and most abiding affection that
the -members of the post welcomed back
to California General Shafter.
General Shafter was next introduced
As he rose from his seat he was accorded
an ovation. In feeling terms he expressed
his appreciation and heartfelt thanks for
the cordial -welcome that had been ex
tended to him.
General Shafter then said: "I am not
going to defend the Santiago campaign.
Cries of "It does not need it" were
shouted from all sides. General Shafter
then briefly outlined the dominant facts
in the Santiago campaign. He was given
th' closest attention, and his remarks
were frequently interrupted by cheers and
applause. , .
"The Army and Navy' was responded
to by Major Field. In addition there were
speeches by Seidon Sturgis, D. C. Smith,
W R. Parnell and W. 11. Smedberg.
LOCAL DENTISTS
MEET AND BANQUET
ACADEMY OF DENTAL SCIENCE
IN SESSION.
Dr. Van Orden Makes Some Unfavor
able Comments Upon the Disposi
tion of Certain Members
to Seek Notoriety.
The members of the San Francisco
Academy of Dental Science held its regu
lar monthly meeting and banquet last
evening at the Snreekels Rotisserie. Dr.
Hart, president of the Academy, called
the meeting to order and announced that
nominations for officers to serve for the
coming term were in order. Dr. Frank
C. Pague was nominated for president,
and as there were no other nominations
he was declared unanimously elected. Dr.
Thomas Fletcher was elected secretary
without opposition.
An excellent menu was then served, and
while the members of the Academy ate,
drank and made merry a hidden orchestra
dispensed sweet music.
At the conclusion of the dinner Dr. Van
Orden read a very interesting paper enti
tled "Ethical Relation of the Dental Pro
fession to the Press." In his paper the
doctor commented freely upon the disposi
tion of certain members of,the dental pro
fession to rush into print at every oppor
tunity. })r. Van Orden severely criticized
this mode of getting notoriety.
The Academy Jias not as yet agreed
upon a code of eftiics covering this point,
and Dr. Van Orden favored its doing so.
When the doctor finished reading 1 Dr.
Pague called Upon Drs. Cool. Merriman,
Hart and Teague to say a few words on
the subject. A warm discussion was pro
voked.
The Academy, though only organized a
short time, gives promise of developing
into a healthy organization. Kiost of the
prominent members of the dental profes
sion have already joined the society.
ELVIA CROX'S DIVORCE.
Says Mr. Seabrooke "Is an Incident
That Was Closed Long Ago."
Prima donna Elvia Crox protested in a
high register when she was told last even
ing that a dispatch from New York said
she had finally begun suit for an absolute
divorce from T. 'Q. Seabrooke, her comic
singer husband.
"Why. I finished divorcing my one
time husband a year ago," she said, "and
there is no need of any more beginning
along that line. It was an absolute di
vorce then, is now, and ever shall be."
When the musical little lady was told
that the dispatch said she had instruct
ed Attorney Ado Hummel to nrrange for
the taking'of her testimony in this city,
and that the lawyer had the name of a
fair co-respondent, she fairly shrieked a
denial.
"1 think this whole report is a scheme
of Mr. Seabrooke to get a little advertis
ing " she cried. "The papers haven't said
much about him for some time. Well, if
he don't be careful he will get more no
tice than he bargained for. Well, I never.
'Finally begun suit for absolute divorce,'
have I? With me. Mr. Thomas Q. Sea
brooke is an incident that is closed and
was closed long ago. Just say that."
JOHN S. BOWMAN'S WILL.
Decedent's Entire Estate Bequeathed
to His Widow.
The will of John S. Bowman, who died
February 23. was filed for probate yester
day. Although the deceased was reputed
to be a capitalist of large means,' the
petition accompanying the will states that
his estate will not exceed $10,000 in value.
In the will Mr. Bowman accentuates nis
kindly characteristics. He leaves his en
tire estate to his widow. Sophie B. Bow
man, but says: "I would like my dear
wife Â»to give to the San Francisco Hebrew
Hospital $50. also $200 to the San Francisco
Hebrew Orphan Asylum, and. if possible.
to relieve my cousin, Max J. Franklin, ot
his indebtedness. I also recommend her
to give something to my friencl. Alax
Armer, and my relatives in Germany. I
have not mentioned any amount, because
I have all faith in her benevolence and
charitable character." In the petition
Mrs. Bowman states that Max J. Frank
lin long ago paid Mr. Bowman ;:11 he
owed himâ at least since the will was
drawn in 1593.

GUNST WINS OUT
IN A SHARP DEAL
Has Secured the Lease of a Desirable
Business Location.
fT\HE power of a Police Commissioner, is. something terrible to It is
THE power of a Police Commissioner mountains, can create as much
stronger than the faith which will move mountains, and can create as much
I terror as a wild bull at a Sunday School picnic. u Qt ~v,i oaa
Â± Mose Gunst is a Police Commissioner. In repose he looks perfectly * a â¢ "*

his teeth and an expression on his face which might be likened to the Innocence

Mose is in the cigar business; and thereby hangs a tale n which the sa loons
and the race track and a desirable business location are the most prominent
features When the Baldwin Hotel was burned Mose's cigar store was also
demolished, and it wa^ a matter of common talk at that time that the poHce took
more trouble to protect the property of their lord and master. Gunst .than that
fease him. He had power. He would use this power, and use it he did
Th* corner of Market and Stockton streets, at the junction of Ellis, struck he
wary Mose as a good place, and he decided to have it. To any one else this would
JaS seemeranfmpossible task, as the firm of Mlchalitschke Bros & Co. has oc
cupied the desirable location for the past fifteen years. This was a mere trifle to
Mose. The old tenants must get out.
The stand in question is on the first floor of one of the buildings owned by the
Flood estate, and is leased by John F, Farley, saloon-keeper, race track man and
friend of Gunst. This made things easy. , ...
Just what the deal was between Farley and Gunst has not been made public,
but the character of this man who has the guardians of public peace and morals
under his thumb is so well known that it can be easily surmised. The results are
public, property. The lease held by the old firm expires to-day, and a lew days
ago it was surprised to learn that Gunst was about to move in. The secretary or
the firm asked Mr. Farley why he could not renew the old lease.
"Oh, well, you are good tenants and all that," retorted the saloon-keeper, but
JimmieFlood owns this shack and he wanted Gunst in here, see!"
The secretary of the firm did not exactly see. so he started out to make fur
ther inquiries. Ho was unable to find Mr. Flood, but learned from that gentle
man's authorized representative that the building is the property of the estate,
not of Mr. Flood individually, and that no one connected with the estate had inter
fered with the tenants of the lessee. And the Michalitschkes are as much in the
dark as ever. They know that they have lost their fine location, and the lease
which they had held for years has been turned over to Mose Gunst, but no ex
planation has been offered.

Return.
John Dougherty, the ex-treasurer of the
Marino Fireman's? Association, who is ac
cused of stealing $17,000 of the funds of the
organization, is locked up in the City
, Prison. He became insane yesterday. He
imagines that a "fat pretty woman" is
â _ pursuing him for the purpose of killing
him. l>ast evening he attempted to as
â¢ fault one of the prisoners confined in the
cell with him. claiming that he was egg-
Ing the imaginary woman on to murder
him.
He became so obnoxious to his cellmates

* * tentedly for worms in the paddock." The Generalissimo came under, the Â°
i American flag with Porto Rico,, the Philippines, Guam and other spoils T
of war, and while he was not mentioned in the peace protocol or the subse- +.
quent treaty, he was none the less won by Yankee valor. â¢ O
He was first seen Industriously swimming away from the luckless Cristobal +
Colon when that Spanish warship was dying under the Oregon's battering O
shells off the Cuban coast. He was picked up by a boat's crew from the Amer- +
lean vessel and carried, expressing his gratitude in hearty grunts, aboard the o
Oregon. He probably had been intended for a juicy roast on the table of the +
Spanish skipper, but the Oregon's guns saved his bacon, and Generalissimo O
Wheeler, as he was then christened, renounced allegiance to the baby King of +
Spain forever. ' O
.Piggy Wheeler accompanied the Oregon on her return trip around the +
Horn, and aboard of her reached Honolulu. The crew decided that the Gen- o
eralissimo had seen enough of Spanish misrule, and fearing to take him to +
Manila, where some American soldier would steal him for the center-piece of O
a camp bcanbake, they decided to present him to Golden Gate Park. He was Â£
therefore carried, squealing. vociferously, aboard the Australia and given in +
charge of Captain H9Udlette. To-day his pigship will be presented to Mayor q

the night he became violent, and it was
found necessary to give him an opiate to
quiet him. â . , .
The pri?on officials are inclined to be
lieve that Dougherty's condition i? due
to an overindulfenco in liquor. After his
return fr->m the Ea^t. where it is said he
squandered most of his ill-irotten sains,
he took to drink and remained in an in
toxicated condition until the day of his
arrest. Learning: lhat iho police were
after him he bought several gallons of
whisky and secreted it in the hold of a
ship which was lying at the loot of Third
fctreet. He then crawled into the hold,
remaining there for four days, not emerg
ing until he had consumed every drop of
the whisky.
In addition to the woman, who is sup
posed to be pursuing him, Dougherty im
agines that Ward, his alleged accomplice,
is conspiring with the police to land him
in San Quentin.
Ward was arrested Monday night on
warrants charging him with stealing sev
eral thousand dollars of the funds of the
association, and when Dougherty learned
of it he declared that the police had ap
prehended him for the purpose of placing
him in his cell and forcing a confession
from him.
â â¢Just let me pet my hands on him," he
screamed as he butted his head against
the iron door of his cell as if trying to
force it open. "1 would give up my life
for a chance to strangle him."
Unless Dougherty's condition improves
the prison officials intend to have him ex
amined by the Commissioners of Lunacy.

THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 1. 1899.
TWEEDIE WON
BY MARVELOUS
RING TACTICS
Proved Too Much for
"Jimmy" Reilly.
FIVE EXTRA ROUNDS ORDERED
TRACEY OUTCLASSED MULLEB
IN THEIR BOUT.
Cole Defeated Alford in Quick Order.
"Tim" Hurst Won Further
Laurels as a
Referee.
The large gathering of sport-lovers who
â witnessed the three fistic contests at
Woodward's Pavilion last evening had,
in the language of the tout, a run for
their money.
The first event, which was to have been
a ten-round bout between Willie Cole of
this city and Ed Alford, a recent impor
tation from New York, ended in the third
round. Alford started out like a lion,
but finished like the proverbial lamb af
ter receiving a few hot left-hand smashes
on the teeth and a brace of wicked
straight right-hand punches In the stom
ach, which must have been sadly out of
order, for the receiver manifested that
strange feeling of "quit" which some
times troubles the pug.
The Reilly and'Tweedie contest was cer
tainly the redeeming feature of the even
ing 1 . The Australian invader proved be
yond all argument that he was a remark
ably clever fellow, who, because of his
quick style or hitting and stopping, can
not apparently administer a "put-me-to
sleep" blow.
Tweedle certainly "put it all over" his
opponent for five rounds, after which time
Reilly opened his eyea to what was going
on and made a stubborn resistance, land
ing some stiff body punched on his oppo
nent. At the end of the tenth round
Referee Tim Hurst was unable to decide
the game and ordered the contestants to
tight on.
In the fourteenth round, when the fight
ers got within close range and mixed up
the game, Reilly caught Tweedie a hard
left swing on the eye, the force of the
blow drawing a flow of claret from the
wounded optic.
In the fifteenth round Tweedie made a
game resistance, and when the finish was
near at hand Reilly staggered against the
ropes almost exhausted. The referee then
gave a decision in favor of Tweedie,
which was well received.
The Mu,ller and Tracey fight can be dis
mibsed in a few words. Muller is a good
amateur fighter who is slow to take an
advantage. He is also awkward on his
feet, and in front of a clever and shifty
exponent of the game he makes a poor
showing.
Tracey had easy sailing. Although re
ceiving some stiff punches in the body in
the mix-ups, the Australian quickly de
tected that the game was within his
reach.
He tried to finish the contest before the
fifth round, but Muller proved a good
taker of punishment and stood his
ground under heavy fire until the tenth
round, when Tracey, who already had
the red vintage flowing from Muller's
proboscis, landed a left swing on the lo
cal man's jaw, and as Muller reeled and
fell into the referee's arms Tracey was
ordered to his corner and the fight came
to an end. Hurst, seeing that the game
was all one way, properly decided the
bout in Tracey's favor, and by so doing
saved Muller from a complete knockout
and won the applause of all fair-minded
In the opening event Cole had plenty of
steam behind his blows in addition to the
advice of George Green, the welter
weight, who acted as his second. In the
first round Alford used rushing tactics,
but was met with stiff lefts and rights,
which materially stopped him. The boys
went at it hammer and tongs just as the
bell rang.
The second round proved a repetition of
the first. In the third CÂ»le displayed some
clever foot work and landed on Alford at
will. â¢ He knocked the latter down and
was called to his corner by Green, who
feared the youngster would become ex
cited and commit a foul, but the moment
Alford was on his feet Cole rushed In and
put him out with a right on the stomach
and head. Alford was clearly outclassed
by Cole, who has shown marked Improve
ment since his last fight.
The only "Billy" â¢Jordan escorted "Kid"'
McCoy into the ring and introduced him
properly to a San Francisco audience.
The "Kid" was unnerved by the enthusi
astic reception, and in answer to cries of
'â¢Speech" managed to say: "I thank you
for this reception. It is not often that
a defeated man gets such a reception. I
was defeated by Shafkey, but I will try
again shortly."
Immediately after the howls of appro
val had subsided the men who furnished
the event of the evening were intro
duced.
"Jimmy" Reilly's following cheered him
until the rafters rang, and the greeting
that "Cocker" Tweedie, the Australian
will o' the wisp, received was also gener-
ous.
At the sound of the gong the fighters
went at it, and for fifteen rounds gave
as fine an exhibition of pluck, speed and
cleverness as ever was seen in this city.
In fact, the fighting was so close that
Referee Tim Hurst called for five extra
rounds before he gave the decision to
Tweedie.
From the sound of the gong in the open
ing round until its clang in the fifteenth
the contestant! fought fast and furious.
Tweedie cut out the pace for his hard
hitting opponent, and for the first eight
rounds bewildered him with his flying
mlts, wonderful ducking and astounding
foot work. Reilly, in his effort to land on
the clever Australian, wore himself out,
but through the excellent handling of
Martin Murphy and Jimmy Lawler he
freshened considerably. From the eighth
to the twelfth he got on to Tweedie's
style and landed with frequency. His
blows, unlike Tweedie's, had plenty of
driviqg power behind them, but "Cocker"
assimilated them all.
In the tenth round the men went at it
furiously, and when the bell sounded
Hurst coolly ordered them to continue.
Reilly's work in the eleventh, twelfth and
thirteenth rounds showed vast improve
ment. In those rounds he took a lease of
life and made things warm for Tweedie.
In the fourteenth the local lad opened
"Cocker's" right eye with a nasty left
swing, arid both men were soon covered
with gore. Each time Hurst called for an
extra round he was hissed and cheered
by the occupants of the pit and gallery.
The last round showed Tweedie's supe
riority After shaking hands he went at
his man and battered down his guard
with his bewildering assortment of blows,
and the last minute of the round found
Reilly fagged out completely. Hurst's de
cision in Tweedie's favor met with uni
versal satisfaction, as it was easily appar
ent that the victor had scored the most
points.
Tweedie's exhibition was an eye-opener
to those who witnessed it. His guarding,
ducking and generalship stamped him as
being the bright particular star in the
ring to-day.

SIERRO'S MURDERER
IS UNDER ARREST
PHILIP FERTTITTA CAPTURED
AT BAKERS BEACH.
He Does Not Deny His Guilt, but
Claims Sierro Threatened
to Kill Him.
Philip Ferttitta. the fisherman who fa
tally stabbed Joseph Sierro in front of 911
Sansome street last Friday night, was
arrested yesterday by Detectives Ed Gib
son, Wren and McMahon and Policeman
Fowle, and wa*s taken to the City Prison,
where he was placed in "the tanks."
The officers had been carefully scouring
the city for Ferttitta, and on Monday
night they got a clew that he had been
seen at Bakers Beach. They went there
yesterday morning at 3 o'clock, but
Ferttitta did not make his appearance.
They waited patiently, and about 11
o'clock they saw him coming out of a
barn in a vegetable garden. He hid in the
brush adjoining tne barn, but was soon
placed under arrest.
Ferttitta made a statement to the effect
that the reason he stabbed Sierro was
because he was a dangerous map and he
was afraid of him, as he had stabbed
other people. He was told that Sierro had
been talking about killing himself or
somebody else. On Friday night, before
leaving 911 Sansome street, Mrs. Salvatore
heard Sierro say that he would lay for
Ferttitta, and she told Ferttitta that Si
erro was outside and would likely injure
him. He took the carving knife off the
table and went outside, when Sierro at
once attacked him. Sierro had a cobble
stone or something else in his hand, and
said, "I will kill you." Ferttitta strug
gled to get away from him, and in the
struggle his hat was smashed. Finding
that he could not get away from Sierro,
he stabbed him.
Ferttitta denied that he was mixed up
in the Maria outrage in New Orleans. He
said he never was in New Orleans and at
that time he was only 17 years of age. A
charge of murder will be placed against
A. tinge of romance is attached to the
stabbing affray that ended in the death
of Sierro. It seems that on the night of
the fatal cutting the murdered man and
Ferrittitta were visiting a Mrs. Salvatore.
who lives at 911 Sansome street. Both
men were infatuated with the woman
and both were jealous of the other's atten
tions to her. During their profonged stay
in her rooms they quarreled and were pre
vented from coming to blows by the pres
ence of their charmer. Before Sierro left
the house he vowed to kill his rival, and
when Ferrittitta bid Mrs. Salvatore good
night he picked up the carving knife and
descended the stairs, with a view to going
to his home next door. As he emerged
from the dwelling Sierro attacked him and
in his own defense he cut his assailant.
Sierro was found an hour later by a
saloon-keeper on the southeast corner of
Broadway and Sansome street, and was
sent to the Receiving Hospital, where he
died. While on the operating table he

HIGHBINDERS
ARE SPOILING
FOR A FIGHT
Pistols May Pop at
Any Minute.
EXCITEMENT IN CHINATOWN
FIVE DISTINCT WARS ARE
READY TO BREAK OUT.
Chin Ooey Threatens to Shoot His
Cousin â Attempt to Blow Up a
Bagnio With an Infernal
Machine.
That Chinatown is like a seething vol
cano, ready to belch forth at any mo
ment, Is shown by the fact that two new
fights were started yesterday. One of
these was the result of trouble between
two members of the same family, and the
other was caused by jealousy over a
woman. Neither had any connection
with the disturbance created last .Sat
urday night by the Sam Yup tong fight,
nor the fight between the Suey Sings and
Suey Yings, nor that between the Hop
Sings and Suey Dins, which resulted in
bloodshed at Marysvllle. None of the
wars mentioned have been settled as yet,
and with the ill feeling existing between
so many different factions the police
would not be surprised to hear of a shoot-
Ing at any moment.
Yesterday afternoon Chin Goey, a mem
ber of the Hop Sing tong, was arrested
for threats against the life of a relative
of his. Chin Gin. When taken to the Cali
fornia-street station the prisoner an
nounced that as soon as he was released
he would kill the man whose life he had
threatened. The members of his tong se
cured his release on bail, and Chin Gin
kept closely in doors all day except when
he was able to secure Officers Bonner and
Butler to take him on to the street.
The trouble between the two members
of the Chin family is the direct result of
an old partnership. They leased a lodg
ing-house on Stockton street some thir
teen years ago and shortly Â« afterward
Chin Gin left for Boston, where he re
mained until recently. During his ab
sence his partner conducted the business
and made no settlement. When about
three months ago Chin Goey learned that
his partner was to return he left for
Portland, but returned, from there at the
request of Chin Gin. When asked to give
an account of the business he refused to
do so and would turn no money over to
Chin Gin, who claims there is $7000 due
him. Unable to secure his money Chin
Gin went to the landlord of the house
and had the lease made out in his name,
leaving Chin Goey out altogether.
Finding that he would no longer be
able to gain possession of any of the
money coming from the lodging-house
Chin Goey, according to the claim of his
former partner, resorted to blackmail.
He went to Chin Gin Monday night and
demanded $300. incidentally notifying his
relative that if the money were not forth
coming the latter was apt to lose his life.
Not willing to give up either his life or
his money. Chin Gin secured the arrest
of Chin Goey.
f'arly last evening the matter was sub
tted to the Six Companies, which de
cided in favor of Chin Gin. Later a meet
ing of the Chin family was held in the
rooms at 126 Waverly place, and after
considerable discussion it was decided to
let the matter rest until to-night. In the
mean time the Hop Sings, who have taken
up Chin Goey's fight, have been called off,
and Chin Gin left the rooms after the
meeting with the assurance that he could
live until the next meeting at any rate.
Despite this assurance he walked to hi 3
store with considerable nervousness, and
viewed with distrust every Chinaman who
came near him.
Officers Bonner and King of Lieutenant
Price's squad were notified by Jew Gee
about lC^o'clock last night that there had
be'en an attempt made to blow up his
brothel with dynamite. The police, upon.
investigation, found lying on the stairway
leading to the house a vicious looking in
fernal machine. It was about four inches
long, an inch and a half in diameter, and
to it was attached eight inches of fuse-
After an examination of the find the po
lice came to the conclusion that it con
tained dynamite, find it was placed in a
bucket of water, where it will remain un
til experts can determine its composition.
Shortly after 10 o'clock Luie Hong, one
of the women, saw a man run up the
stairway of the house, and after deposit
ing something on the steps he ran away.
Looking from a window she perceived
that the ob.iect which he had placed on
the steps was on fire, and she imme
diately extinguished the blaze with a
bucket of water.
Jew Gee, the proprietor of the house, Is
a member of the Gee Ock Kong tong.
which has headquarters in Spofford alley.
Tie stated to the police that his society
was at war with no one and he was at a
loss to explain the attempt to destroy his
property. There was trouble in the house
over a year ago, but at that time it was
owned by another man. While the police
were unable to definitely determine tho
cause of the affair, it is generally believed
that jealousy over a woman was at the
bottom of it.
Had Another Wife.
Delia Smith has sued her husband. John
Smith, for an annulment of marriage.
Mrs. Smith avers that when she married
her husband he had another wife living.
