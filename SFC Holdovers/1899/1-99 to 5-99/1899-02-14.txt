MANILA, Feb. 14, 9
a. m. â Iloilo, the
stronghold of the Fil
y ipino insurgents on
the island of Panay
and the seat of gov
ernment of the so
called Visayan con
; federation, was cap
tured by the American
forces under the com
/ mand of General Miller
on Saturday. .
??? The â :.; United States gunboat
? Pet arrived late last evening
y with dispatches from Brigadier
? General M. P. Miller to Major
.7 General Otis, announcing that
; Iloilo had been taken by the com
. â  billed military and naval forces.
..;.: General Miller, on receipt .of
.. his instructions from Manila, sent
native commissioners ashore
from the United States transport
| .'St, ; Paul with a communication
for the rebel Governor of Iloilo
r calling: upon him to surrender
; ! before the evening of February
; 13 arid warned him not to make
,?a demonstration in the interval.
Kb answer was made to this
and from the vessels it was notic
ed that there seemed to be a great
deal of activity among the insur
gents on shore. Armed bands
could be seen moving through
the streets of the native portion
of the City toward the intrench
merits thrown up on the outskirts
arid the rebels moved their guns
and prepared to defend their po
sition. : Thereupon . the Petrel
: : fired . â  two . . warning guns, the
\ rebels immediately opening fire
. upon her.
The Petrel and the Baltimore
â¢ â¢ then bombarded the town, which
the rebels having set on fire, im
mediately evacuated.
The landing was â¢ begun
promptly at 6 o'clock and made
without incident. The men
quickly formed upon landing and
marched into position.
As soon as all was . ready to
march against the armed insur
gents it was found that the main
body of the latter had fled, leav
ing a small rear guard. This
guard, made a slight show of re
sistance- and after firing one â  or.
two ragged volleys, took to their .
heels. ?
y â¢ In the skirmish no Americans
were hit. A number Of insur
gents,, probably twenty-five or
thirty, were wounded, but no
dead were found. ,y.
â¢ At {he time of the sailing of the
Petrel General Miller , was - in
peaceful possession of the city.
The native portion of the town
was almost entirely destroyed
The damage to the foreign por
tion was slight.

THE OFFICIAL REPORT.
â¢WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.-Shortly before midnight Adjutant Gen
eral Corbin made public the following dispatch from -Major General
Otis, reporting the capture of the town of "Iloilo by the" American
forces under General- Miller on the 11th inst:
"Manila, --Feb. 13.-General | Miller reports from Iloilo that the town
was taken on the 11th inst: and held by his troops. The insurgents
were given until the evening. of the 13th to surrender, but their hos
tile actions brought on an engagement during the morning The in
surgents fired the native portion of the town.- There was but little
losses to the property of foreign inhabitants and no casualties among
the troops are reported. -â¢'-.....' OTIS"
During the past week the rebel lead
er has been personally visiting his
troops, who are occupying the country
between Malolos, the insurgent capital
and Caloocan, which. ls now held by the
Americans. He is seeking by every
means in his power to encourage his
men, but he finds the task a somewhat
difficult one. -/;"/ 7 . '.
The truth, will not, of course, suit his
purpose, so he is magnifying the losses
sustained by our troops, placing them
at very high figures, while, at the same
time, he tells his deluded followers that
their losses have been very small.
He says his army has not been de
feated, and declares that he simply
withdrew his forces in order to draw
out the Americans to a place where he
can surround and annihilate them. He
speaks sarcastically of , the military
ability .of the American commander,
and seeks to give the impression that
his plans for the destruction of the
: American army and the ultimate estab
lishment of the Filipino republic are
working out exactly as he intended
they should. " Many of his men believe
everything he. tells them, but others,
in ' view of -the events â¢in which
they have participated during. the past
week, are dubious concerning the prac
ticability of annihilating the Ameri
cans, much as they desire to do so.
Aguinaldo. knows, that his capture is
.sought by the Americans, and he is
constantly taking extraordinary pre
cautions to keep from falling into our
hands, which would mean the bursting
of the bubble of self-government he
has blown for his own. ends. He has
turned over the active command of his
army to General' Luna, former Secre
tary -of War in '.the. Filipino Cabinet,
and will himself: keep but of reach of
the Americans. .' General Luna is- the
author of nearly; all the, bellicose arti
cles which have' appeared in the in
surgent â¢ Rapers during the -past two
months. " . . ' . . .â¢ -y ' â¢
" The headquarters of the rebel army
has been; established at Polo, where
there is great [activity among the
leaders. -'A'- * ?â¢' ."
â¢ The .truth? concerning the serious de
feats* the rebels have "..sustained is lust
commencing to be whispered in Malolos
and other Filipino towns, despite ; all
'efforts to conceal it. The leaders first
announced thVt * 3000. Americans had
been killed in , tVe various engagements
-since a week am Saturday, night, and
that among them was 7 General ?. Otis,

too much for them and little ' trouble

day, and while there could not con
tent themselves without firing several
shots- at the rebels. One of the sail
ors, who had obtained shore leave, was
found among 'the men of the Kansas

parently enjoying himself hugely.

There has been no change in the dis

LORD CHARLES BERESFORD, Rear Admiral of the : %
Royal- Navy, in the speech which he delivered before the Â©
Chamber of Commerce yesterday, brought out one domi- Â©
nant view, although he did not express it in exact words, Â©
and that was that the time was not far distant when America Â©
and England would have to unite to protect their mutual Â©
interests in China and throughout the world and that â¢ to- Â£
gether they would have to call a halt to Russia and cry -f
"Hands off of that which is ours." He also intimated that >
in his opinion the time would come when . America â¢ and Â£
England would form at least a trade alliance, if not one of a Â°
o f
closer nature. * The former, he believed, was bound to re- o
suit because of the mutual trading interests of the - - two Â©
nations. . o
Rear Admiral Charles Beresford,
Royal Navy, was tendered a public re
ception by the Chamber of Commerce i
of this city yesterday afternoon. Never
in the history Â»of 5 San Francisco has
there been such a representative gath
ering in that institution. â¢ Not only
was the Chamber of Commerce repre
sented by its j most prominent members,
but there were also present representa
tives of all of the other commercial or
ganizations in the city. Besides, the
civic attendance, the army was repre-
sented by ; Adjutant General â¢ Babcock
in the absence of Major . General Shaf
fer, and the navy by Commodore J. A.
Watson and other officers from Mare
Island.. ' ???.??:
? First Vice President George A. New-
hall presided in the. absence' of Presi
dent Charles , Nelson of the ; Chamber of
Commerce. ';- It had - been announced
that Lord Beresford "was to address
the chamber at 2 o'clock, but long be
fore "that time the assembly j hall of the
chamber, was crowded almost to suffo
cation by those who had assembled to
listen to the views" of the distinguished
representative of the Associated Cham,
bers of Commerce of Great Britain re- i
garding the future of American and
English trade in the East.
In honor of Lord Beresford the ros^
trum had been appropriately decorated
with the stars and stripes and.the Eng
lish;' union jack. Promptly at 2 o'clock
Mr. Newhall entered, followed by Lord
Beresford, his private secretary, Mr.
Robin Grey, and Mayor Phelan. ' .As
soon as the assemblage caught sight. of
his Lordship they accorded him, a wel
come that in warmth of cordiality and
sincere friendship has never before
been extended to any other foreign visi
tor. Whin the applause had subsided
Mr. Newhall took his seat, with Lord
Beresford and his secretary on the
right, and Mayer Phelan .on his left.
Mr. Newhall then said: ..-'..

The Public Reception
Mr. Mayor and Fellow Members of the
Chamber of; Commerce: It is with much
pleasure that I bid a hearty welcome to
our distinguished visitor, Lord ..' Charles

.We have gathered together to-day to do

He is. .as you are all aware? now on his
way home full of information on the East

interested ' at this time,? and to-day we
will have the pleasure of hearing from
him. on; this subject.

sents, are, proud of the opportunity [ to do

for our future trade that is just now open- '
ing up after the glorious victory of our
well beloved Dewey. ". -..- . â¢ -..'.:â¢
Lord Beresford comes- among us" to get '
information and to cement the bonds of
friendship that exist between us and. our 'Â°
English cousins. .He will, tell us this' aft
ernoon what he has .found and what his .'.
impressions: are of this new people we"
are about to open up business relation, 0
with. . .. . ' ' ."'â¢'.
We- look . with pride on the navy of " .
which our visitor is- so distinguished a'
member; but, after all, what is the navy â¢
but the ally .of commerce? The history of ?Â°
England shows that the commercial men .
were the very first to follow, where the.-'
navy had cleared the way. ; In our owii
case we will go forward to the lands '

that our president, 'Captain-Charles Nel
son, is UnabLe to be with us;. to-day to
extend in his own genial way a welcome
to our -visitor.' '-. :.' -''.-..' -. "
.- I therefore- call' upon our Mayor,. the
Honorable James 'D. â¢ Phelan, to. deliver
the- address of Welcome. 'â¢ â¢;;
Mayor Pheian's Welcome
To Lord Beresford
Mayor Phelan spoke briefly and to
the .point. As if in anticipation of what
was to be said by Lord Beresford, he
outlined the subject that would be dis
cussed by ..the English admiral, dwell
ing on its great importance, and point
ing otlt the 'fact ' that by reason of his
investigations Lord Beresford was in
a position to throw much light on the
subject of the future trade of this coun
try and that his words of advice should
be attentively listened to and given the
greatest consideration.
The Mayor was followed by United
States District Judge W. W. Morrow,
who on behalf of the judiciary warmly,
welcomed Lord Beresford, and at the
same time dwelt on the great impor
tance of the proper development of our
trade with the East. He alluded brief
ly to his Lordship's record as an officer
and a statesman, and he paid him high
tribute for his bravery, sterling quali
ties as a man and astute' reasoning as
a director of affairs of the .great na
tion that he represented. : V- ; . .yy y^*-'
Horace Davis, of the Merchants'
Association I followed Judge Morrow.
He briefly outlined the growth of our
Eastern trade ,- up to to-day, and
pointed to. the necessity of, 'properly
looking after its future. When he had
concluded, Mr. Newhall rose arid, in
troduced Lord Beresford. As the dis
tinguished officer came forward to bow
his acknowledgments' to- the assem-
plage he was given- a. perfect ovation.
The British ' Officer .
An Impressive Speaker
A glance at his Lordship argued
much in favor of what lie should have*
to say even before he spoke. First, it
was evident that he Was of that sturdy
Anglo-Saxon stock, though .born ,in
Ireland, that has been in the habit
of conquering everything that it
comes in contact with. 'He is of the
average height, well built" and holds
himself as erect as an arrow. He pos
sesses . a genial, happy, open counte
nance and keeps his face clean shaven.
His brow 'is high and" ponderous. His
mouth indicates that firmness of char
acter that he has exhibited on more
than one occasion. .He has a pair of
gray eyes, that while they are gener
ally sparkling with good humor, have
at. the same time that certain power of
fascinating one, and demonstrating the
fact that he means every word he ut
ters. ... â¢ ."
7 Lord Beresford. speaks rapidly but
distinctly. He stands squarely on his
feet and uses hardly any gestures. For
the most part he kept his arms locked
behind him, and whenever he wished
to emphasize a particular statement
he did so by leaning* forward and
punctuating his words by slowly plac
ing the forefingers of his right hand in
the palm of his left. There.was in the
very tone of his voice a certain earn
estness that was not to be gainsaid or
questioned. He told of things as he
had found : them. He produced facts to
support his evidence. He was practical2
;' In what he asserted, but. at the same |
. . time 'he' declared" that he was .only too.
eager. and. anxious.. to secure the views \
of others That he is honest sin
. cere in what. He says,; and that he be
. lieves' it to be true., there-' is no denying. j
'His vprv personality is sufficient seciir
â â¢ity that his- integrity of purpose is not
' .to be 'doubted; ..Lord. _Beresford ; was
given' the ver,"* â¢ closest attention, and
'every word: that he uttered, was care r
fully' listened tv He did not waste a
sentence He weighed his words close*
* ly, and when he made a statement he.
followed if 'in with . facts and proofs,
and -.clinched, and- scored his. point in
such. ; a..- manner that there was no
â  ..doubting it. This is a, -description of

There is- one- more fact that I can point

: San Francisco Coming
Seaport of America
? .'The -question of? this port. ' This'
port, in my opinion, and the ports of
Hongkong, .in China, in the future
must be ; the ipo richest almost in the ;
â¢ whole world. Certainly in connection
with the Chinese -trade. This must be
the point .of departure whether you
make that -.Nicaragua . trade canal or
not. If you do make that canal It

trade opehpd ; up .in China? If China is I
opened, up- you- ill .get the benefit by i

This is the port that merchants
.will come to. ; . There is no doubt in
my mind that San Francisco in the
future must be a great and . a more
powerful nd richer place than it is i
at the, present time. '.'â¢".. ,
I think I stood upon the pier' in the year '
1854 and saw the first steamer start, to the I
'Wat through the Golden Gate. I think
so, but whether thin is .so or not the Im
provement in this place is something
marvelous from what I saw of It as a boy
in 1664.- . Â7'.,7;-'-V: . *
And I think if we can settle this
Chinese question: upon a line which I
propose, upon the broad fair pol
icy of equal [ opportunity to all na- <
tions, that there is no doubt that the <
whole world will be benefited as
much as San Francisco. '-...--.;
Now we have heard: a good deal-In thÂ»
press, and - certainly have heard often
rom pur statesmen and others, upon the
question of the open door. Well, what Is
the. open door? After all, It is no new
policy in China; All we want as 1 Britishers -
' is to keep the treaties as they are. ;- If
you' break, up the integrity of China in
varfablv you will break up the open door.
â¢ It is a question of the aptitude- and the
power of nations- to : carry on their trade'
as. it is at.-present. Well, yoU may say.
How is that threatened?- :It is threatened
in two way..' It is threatened in one way â¢
by the effeteness of the Chinese Govern
ment. Traders and ; financiers and men
who invest money.- arc very clever people,
and they are hot going : to money
unless they see it secured.

: 'â¢ . â¢ ' . . .;-â¢â â¢â¢â 
; ? China, in its present situation is
not only in a bad position for the trade
that is already there, but it certainly ;
isn't in a position for further devel
opment. Well, the other question is
a question: of the: position of other
countries. I do. not like . to? mention
names; but I dare say you will know
whom I. refer to. I will refer to mili- j
tary domination. If you see countries
that get into positions of great ad- I
vantage, you see. when they get into
those positions they claim territorial
rights, and j you see no counterpoise
whatever placed in the. way of those
countries or to : balance those coun
tries^; ambition. You naturally, think
that they will do what they have
done before. â¢ '. " '.. 'r
.. I will say that, the country in the
North has placed herself in' position
in which she may, in the near future, -
be absolutely in the position of claim
ing territorial rights and putting on
tariffs. -
â Now, I do not claim those countries
want to. If I had been a subject of the
country in the north -1 should have -been
iii Peking long ago.- But I put it like this:
If you see a man with a match going to
light a haystack.; lsn't it much, easier tb
blow out the match than to blow out. the
haystack after it is lighted? â¢ â¢ â¢
Now, in saying this, my proposal
for stopping such activity as I have
just mentioned isn't a proposal lead
ing to war; It is a proposal that must
keep the peace, and it is a proposal
which would keep. China and Europe
as they are, and which will allow the
trade of all nations to go on as it is?
.Now. what is my proposal? I am sim
ply a. gentleman who has. been asked to go
out to China and give my views of the
trade and commerce and how- it is to be
secured. These are my views, and no-,
body- else's views, so far as I know;- but
I hope.they will be the views of a great
number of .people-. after, this.':
Lord Beresford Makes
A Pregnant Proposal
My proposal* is this: Let the four
nations who are . mostly -interested in
the trade of China, because they have ]
got it nearly all now, Great j Britain, (
America, Germany and. Japan let
.then, join together? do not call it ..an
alliance,' let them come to an .under
standing that the .treaties are to re- !
main as they are, that China is to" i
maintain its integrity, and that no i
other country, no matter what coun- j
try it may. be, is to claim territory in
China and put on taxes....- â¢
Let me speak of the alliance. You
can call it by any other, name, I do
not care a fig for the. word or name.
I am aware of one. fact and that is
-we are .the same m .blood, ' religion, â¢
and that .we speak the. same r lan
guage. We have the same ideas' of
chivalry, we are the two greatest na
tions on earth 'and the most patriotic.
When the Queen or your President
calls for men they respond, and there
is. no conscription. You would not 'â 
have been Anglo-Saxons if you had
not kicked : out the ' mother country
when' you did, but let us iron out the
wrinkles of the past, let us forget
the bitterness and let us give this
hew spirit of friendship an opportun
ity to grow and develop to its fullest
strength. Together we can defy the'
entire, world. The time is coming i
when by a merging of our mutual in
terests we must stand together in be
half of civilization, trade, and Chris
tianity. .
After his speech Lord Beresford was '
Introduced, to the. members of the Cham- I
ber of Commerce and the others who !
were present..

SMITH AND LAVIGNE.
The Champion Lightweight Pugilists
7 'y Have Signed Articles to Fight v
-â¢"'J ',-:... .7;:. on March 10. ; ;' -*"Â£/*
"Mysterious Billy" Smith, the whlr'
wind pugilist,, who has captured many
scalps in the prize ring; Billy â¢ Lavigne,
who represented." his- brother. George; Jim
Kennedy ant" J. Collins, officials of the
Excelsior Athletic Club'-. Billy Hennessy,
trainer of /Smith,, and 'a. few prominent
members'.'of the sporting set. met last?
' evening in -Charley; G.ggus' emporium?,'
sport' arid'dfeou'ssed the proposed 20-round
contest -between Smith arid Lavigne. "t~
. Articles were fira.wn.up and signed by
the taunt -who are â  -interested in the; cppr â 
test.- .They -state that' the bout shall take j
place in .Woodward's; Pavilion on the 1
evening. of March" 10; that ,'the contestant-? '
must weigh In at 1,2 pounds at 8 o'clock ' j
prior to entering the ring 'arid that in case
one of the principals' fail to com- |
ply with the articles in this respect he. I
must forfeit 30 per cent of the 00 per cent I
of the gross receipts which they will con-; i
test for.
Billy Lavigne thought that a referee '
should not be selected until the very last j
moment, as he was not in favor of glv- i
ing the gamblers a chance to win him j
over in case he was named some days In
advance of the day of the fight.
v . Kennedy objected to the last moment
clause on the ground that the patrons of
the game invariably hold off in their pur
chases of tickets until a referee is named.
The matter, however, was patched up 'â 
when a suggestion was offered that the â¢
principals meet one week before- the bat -7
tie and/discuss the question; then, if a
referee can be chosen who will prove I
satisfactory to both men. his --'name can
be made public there and then or with- '
held until the club officials and- the fight- j
ers agree as to the time when his 'name
shall be given to the public through the
columns of the press. >-
Dr. Zobel has been engaged by the' club i
to examine the pugilists at their training I
quarters and also on the evening before
the battle. Director Kennedy is very par
ticular that a thorough examination be
made as to the physical qualifications of
the fighters. He contends that only men >
sound in body and limb and who have !
had a thorough training should be allowed
to enter into a contest that requires a
contestant to be physically perfect.
George Lavigne has been in training for
the past week at Blanken's Six-mile
House and Smith will leave to-morrow for
Croll's Gardens, Alameda, where he will
remain under the watchful eyes of his wire i
find his trainer, Hennessy, until called |
upon to give an account of himself. The
men will certainly meet the weight stlpu-
lated in the aÂ»ticles, as Smith now scales '
only 152 pound's. He says that it will not ;
be any kind of a trick on his part to take ]
off ten pounds. The mysterious personage :
will, however, have the better of his op
ponent by at least five Inches in height.

GENERAL OTIS WILL
AWAIT COMMISSIONERS
No Conference to Be Held With
Aguinaldo Until Schurman and
Associates Arrive. y?
. NEW YORK, Feb. 13.â The Washington correspondent of. the Her,
aid telegraphs: When the civilian members of the Philippine Com
mission arrive in Manila there is reason to believe that a conference,
will Immediately be arranged with Aguinaldo and other native lead
ers. Until President Schurman and his colleagues reach Manila, it is
not the understanding of officials here that General Otis will accept,
the Invitation of Aguinaldo to confer with him and agree to a cessa
tion of hostilities. General Otis Will continue*' his policy of attack
against the insurgent band and of destroying any military organiza
tion among the Filipinos, wherever they can be reached," and- it is
expected that by the time the American Commissioners reach their
destination they will be in a state where they will be quite willing
to listen to the peaceful representations which the commission will
make to them. As General Otis and Rear Admiral Dewey are mem- â 
bers of the commission the natives will quickly understand that any .
agreement which may be reached will be binding. '.'".:'
An official with whom I talked said that the commissioners will ,
show the natives that the purpose of the United States in . extend
ing its sovereignty over the islands is' in their interest more' than 7
it is that of this country; that there is no intention of continuing the.
Spanish policy of oppression, and that the archipelago will be given'
self-government as rapidly as possible, under the protection, of
course, of the American nation. President Schurman and his col
leagues will arrive in Hongkong during the course of a
couple of weeks, and Rear Admiral Dewey has been instructed' to '
send a man-of-war to that port to welcome them and to bring them
to Manila.
Early in March, it is believed, the Grant will reach her destina
tion. Major General LawtPn has been Informed of the situation on
the island of Luzon, and it is expected he-will direct the steamer Grant
to be pushed as rapidly as possible in order that Manila may. be
reached .without delay. The Grant has 1728 officers and men on
board and will be a welcome addition to General Otis' forces.

.soon afterward Mr. Palmer called a maid,'
saying: â  .'â  â¢ fc ;'
"Come down; I guess I have killed her."
The girl went downstairs and. saw her
mistress lying on the floor. The maid

Mr. Palmer still .held the revolver and was
apparently about to commit suicide. The
coachman seized his master and disarmed
him. .-,.-.-â¢. . \ ' y .:.".:;â¢â

so by telephone, and the doctor notified
the medical examiner, who reached the
house soon after the shooting. He found
five bullet wounds, four of which were In
the left breast. Palmer was arrested. He
explained to the officers that he had been
suffering from grip.

SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 13.â 1n view of his
denial of the records, it Is. at present
rather uncertain whether Albert Pollard,
.bookkeeper for the Dunham, Carrigan &
Hayden Company, is oris not married.
So far as marriages are concerned, the
records of Marin County abound In mys

Last Monday a young man giving- the
name of Albert Pollard, residence' 208

affair be kept a secret. On the Wednes
day following he was* married to Miss
' Monahan in -Sausalito by Justice Bellrude.
who was requested to "keep mum"and
not make any record for thirty days. *
When Pollard was questioned at his res
idence at San Francisco he strenuously
denied that he was a benedict and said
only one lady was to be found in the
house, a . servant â  girl, whose . name he

.'SAN LUIS OBISPO, Feb. 13.â Fire
hei*e at 7 o'clock this evening resulted in
the total destruction of nine buildings
on the principal business corner, with
a loss aggregating about $20,000. The
buildings were of wood and in an hour
a space 150 feet square was a mass of
ashes. â¢=>-*. *-â¢->
The fire started the corner building
at Hlguera and Chorro streets, occu
pied as a saloon, and was caused by
the explosion of a gasoline stove. In
five minutes the entire building, two
stories high? was a mass of flames. The
occupant, C. H. Meyers, barely escaped
with his life, saving nothing,' and his
family, \occupylng the upper story, got
out with difficulty.
The buildings on either side were
speedily ablaze and the fire spread
rapidly to the creek on the north side
and the brick block of H. M. Warden
on the south before it was got under
control. : ;
The losses, as far as k.iown, are as
follows: C. H. Johnson, buildings,
$7000; F. Chiesa, grocery store, $500; E.
Fleugler, bakery, building and stock,
$4000; E. j Hoefer, building and stock,
$5000; A. W. Steinhart, cigar store,
$1000; M. A. Marshall, Jeweler, on stock,
$200; W. A. Wood,. cigar store, building
and stock, $(500; A. G. Pinho, barber,
fixtures, $250; . H. J. Dutton, grocer,
$1000. 7
Most of the destroyed buildings were
small and had been erected many years
ago. They burned like tinder, yy
NO HARBOR DAY FETE.
Los Angeles Citizens Forego the Pro.
;.' /// posed Celebration. .
. LOS 7 ANGELES, Feb. 12.-The .Mer
chants' and Manufacturers* Association
has formally resolved against a free har^
bor jubilee. The matter was taken up
by the directors In a discussion of the
feasibility of raising $20,000 in cash' to
pay the expenses of a harbor celebration
and entertain the National Educational
Convention. It Is estimated that each ot
these functions would require $10,000- in
contributions.. Â«If the jubilee finance com
mittee gets what is .needed for the har
bor carnival nothing will be left for the
entertainment of the visiting teachers.
Feeling convinced that it was too much
to ask Los Angeles people to. contribute
$20,000, the Merchants'- and Manufactur
ers! Association preferred to entertain the
teachers and let the jubilee alone.
:â¢ The resolutions as adopted and sent to
the jubilee committee and other commer
cial. bodies relate, that the three commer
cial organizations of -this city have
pledged themselves to collect $10,000 for
the entertainment- of the National Edu
cational Cenvention to be held in this city
in July, 18Â», and it is now proposed to
celebrate the' commencement of the work
on San Pedro about May 1 next, for. which
an additional sum of $10,000 Is required.
â¢ The amounts necessary to carry out the
: contemplated - events will - be ' contributed
largely by merchants and manufacturers,
and the association concludes that Is too
heavy a load to carry. v- . .

strong. on the Tondo district in the. rear
of Ma-Arthur's division.' At that time
the situation was alarming. I ordered
an attack upon Caloocan. . The order
was to clear out the enemy, at least in

"Aguinaldo is collecting -forces 1 -' some

he will be able to collect it is Impossible
to -tell, perchance as -many, as 12,000. The
more he brings together the more satis

have him attack us than to have to

said:.
"General Otis, in congratulating me

there were 6000 Filipinos opposed to my
division, and that we cleared out a
thousand of them. I think: we shall
have to give them another good lick

I also: had a talk with General Mac-

quite as. much upon statesmanship as

who, know they must lose all power
once the -fighting is' over, and conse

the belief that they have got the best
of the recent. fighting. These English
men do not think there will be much

Murderer Atkinson Is
y Found Guilty. ,
SEVEN YEARS' IMPRISONMENT
SEQUEL TO A PECULIAR SHOOT
ING AFFRAY.
Standing in British Columbia, the
. '.': ? Convicted Man Had Shot aa
?:?:.':. Enemy? Who Was on y
American Soil.
Special .Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. I. J. B. Atkinson,
Who stood in British Columbia last
summer and shot William Patterson,
who was; on the American side at
Blame? was to-day sentenced to seven
years at hard labor in the State Peni
tentiary by Judge Hadley at Whatcom.
Patterson was an old soldier In feeble
health and was generally liked by the
residents . of Blame, where he lived.
These facts caused an emphatic out*
break of indignation when . it was
learned he had been shot by Atkinson,
who quarreled -with him over a trivial
matter. ; ,?'
Atkinson formerly conducted a hotel
In British Columbia and was known to
be handy with his revolver. He shot
Patterson deliberately and it was sup
posed at the time that he.had purposely
stood: across the line on British -soil In
order to complicate matters if he were
arrested. He gave himself - up, how
ever, the British â¢ Columbia police?
who, with Atkinson's consent, delivered
him ;to the authorities of Whatcom
County;.. - â¢'â ;â :â¢â â¢ .-â 'â¢:.*'â¢:'â¢â¢*
Patterson soon , died of his injuries
and was given one of the largest funer
als ever seen at Blame. A charge of
murder was filed against Atkinson, but
through, some mistake he was charged
with only, murder in the second degree.
The trial began three weeks ago and
was hotly contested, Atkinson's attor
neys presenting a plea of self-defense.
The. jury to-day brought in a verdict
of guilty, y with recommendation for
mercy. ?;y â /"/'â  /â :â /.. y/ /Vy ':â '::
Judge Hadley gave Atkinson a severe
lecture in passing sentence. He said
that in view, of the recommendation for
mercy he did. not : feel justified in : as
sessing the maximum penalty. Judging
by the evidence, however, he believed
Atkinson should be severely punished
or else he was not guilty. He therefore
recognized the jury's recommendation
and sentenced him : to the penitentiary
for seven years and to pay a fine of
$100.-y ?: y . TyyyyyY/ :.>-y-v-:-?- Ty'
The case will not be appealed to the
Supreme Court. County Attorney
Meade says a reversal is just what At
kinson' doesn't want, for if he should
get it the State. would file a new infor
mation and this time there would be
no blundering, . but it would charge
murder in the first degree. He claims
to/ have new* evidence 7 which would
make the -case': go still 'harder! for. the
murderer. .>â â¢â â¢ -.'-â â¢:-'-â  ,?:â -: â '"/.-.

MONTREAL, Feb. 13.â Beyond de- ..
claring the statement that he had ad
vised Aguinaldo to drive the Americans
out of the Philippines before reinforce-'
ments arrived to be a lie, Agoncillo ab

He then showed the first official ca

stated that the Americans were to

announced that they intended to ex

y- â: â;
Members Declare There Will Be No
Senatorial Caucus.
COMMON CAUSE AGAINST BURNS
Grant, .Barries, Bulla and Scott Supporters Will See to
; It That Huntington Will Not Be Represented
Instead of the State of California.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SAC
RAMENTO, Feb. There
7 will be- no Senatorial ' caucus.
This has' been determined to-day by
the positive ' declarations of the sup
porters of Grant. Barnes, Bulla and
Scott. .',-â¢.
The lash of the Southern. Pacific
Company, which for the past three
days has been applied to the backs
of. the legislators through the edito
rial ana local columns pf the Sacra
mento Record-Union and the Oakland
Tribune for the purpose of attempt
ing a caucus in the interests of Dan
7 Burns, has utterly failed of its in
tended effect.
It has had an effect, however,- and
that a very decided one. There is
ripw no member of the Legislature
who is so blind that he cannot see
that the railroad is behind Burns arid
Â« that if he were elected United States
.? .Senator; he would .go. to Washington
as the representative of Collis P.
Huntington and not as the repre
sentative of the people, of the State
Vr.pl California. I ?â¢?; '-7. y ;
This fact having been clearly
demonstrated, the supporters of other
Senatorial candidates have entered
into an implied agreement to stand
together against the common enemy
and to join hands in combating
every move the railroad and Burns
may make to bring about any condi
tion whereby it: would be possible for
Burns to do by stealth what it is im
possible for him to do in the open.
"Dannell M. Burns." as Assemblyman
Kenneally pronounces the name of the
Candelaria candidate? is neither a hap
py nor a confident man to-night. His
self-composure is. vanishing and little
exhibitions or outbursts of temper. mar
his customary serenity., This ugly feel
ing is all on account of the refusal of
the Republicans to go into A caucus on
the Senatprship. Early last evening
the touts Were .boastful 7 and defiant
Lined up at the? bars- and grouped on
the streets, they boasted that the
ycoidhel" had the battle won. To-night
they are sullen and uncommunicative.
When pressed for news of the camp
they reply that there will be no change
in the balloting strength of the
''colonel' to-morrow. Beyond that no
information is imparted.
The hardest day's work of the cam
paign in*the Burns camp was done to
day and it was directed to the single
purpose of obtaining a caucus. Sena
tors and Assemblymen of the Grant
forces and the Barnes and Bulla fol
lowing, were . interviewed, ... badgered,
harassed 7 and ; even threatened, but the
result of the various efforts was disap- '
pointing in the extreme? â¢
Some of the. touts; and those of the
best grade of the lot argue with ap
parent sincerity .and great earnestness
that, the Republicans: must conform to
party usage and settle" the contest in
caucus. When it is suggested that the
points at dispute could be readily set
tled to advantage Of the State and
the Republican party, by the elimination .
of Grant and Burns from the contest
they reply that the withdrawal of the
"coipnei" cannot be thought of as he is '
in the fight for vindication.
The argument is advanced that
Colonel Burns has been assailed by. the
newspapers and therefore -must. be vin
dicated, The fact that California is in
danger of losing the services of a. Sena
tor counts for nothing as against, the
proposition that Brims might emerge
..from the conflict without a vindication.
The President may need another sup
porter in the ; Senate . of the United
States to sustain the policy of the ad- ,
ministration in dealing ; with the great
questions growing out of the >'ar with
. Spain, but President Mckinley must
have "vindicated Dan" of California oi
nobody at all frorit this State There
are men in the Legislature whose minds
are Well balanced on ordinary topics, I
but who talk seriously of supporting
Burns to the finish in order that he may :
be vindicated
According to the boastings of . the
touts, public sentiment is to be awak
ened in every .county of the State to
force the Legislature into a caucus, be
cause Burns has reached the conclusion
that he cannot win without a caucus?
Men here on the ground who. aye fa
miliar with the facts of the situation
know that Mr. Grant has announced his
willingness to step aside and permit the
election of a Senator provided that
Burns shall pursue the same course. ".= â ?
' Grant, as badly as he needs a vindi
cation of his own course, is not so self
ish and insolent as to demand it at the
expense, of . California's representation
in the Senate of the United. States; If
Burns had any idea. of loyalty to the
Republican party or any sense of grati
tude for the favors bestowed upon him
self and Mose Gunst by a Republic:
Governor he would withdraw from- -he
race and permit .the election. of a Sen-;
ator. ; -.; -â¢':.'â¢ 'â '. â¢-.' ? ,; ' 'y-â¢ 'â  .â¢'"â¢â¢ '
. The plans of the railroad corporation
and the railroad press are to be directed
this week to the manufacture of public
sentiment throughout the State in fa
vor of a caucus, so that Dan Burns may
be vindicated.-'.So far as returns- have
been received; the people ', are almost
unanimous In proclaiming that no-Sen
ator at all would -be better than Burns ,
_Â» Senator. As soon as the Record-
Union of Sacramento and the Tribune
of Oakland came out for a caucus the
railroad mask was thrown off. The
lines of the campaign are now clearly
defined. Huntington and Herrin are or
one side and the people of California
on the other. Every ballot for Senator
from this time until the close of the
Senatorial contest will be studied by
the voters of California to see whether
the members of the Legislature are
serving the people or the railroad.
GENERAL W. H. L

Senator" Rowell. of .Fresno, x who has
been voting for Thomas' Bard of Ven
tura, may hereafter cast. a few ballots

not signify a determination upon the
part., of the Fresno Senator , to abide
permanently in the Bulla camp. Sena
torial courtesy' and sympathetic rea
sons of a personal nature, may impel
Dr. Rowell to- this change of base. A
strong effort has ' been made to induce
Senator Stratton to vote several times
for. his. brother Senator from Los An
geles.. These 'â¢ vigorous efforts to rein
force Mr. Bulla are designed to coun
teract a movement from Los Angeles to

â¢- The railroad lash wielded by Herrin
is not commanding the. ready obedience

islature who have heard from y their

the. people in this Senatorial struggle.
This evening the Grant men are more
confident than ever that BurnS cannot
by any combine? or trick win out.
There is an anpreherision'in the Burns
camp ' that Grant has some- hidden
strength which will be displayed when
the break comes, yet the touts pro

haps next week to make a showing of
strength; hence it may be expected that
Burns will redouble his energies to
bring into his camp every voter that
can be tricked, cajoled or coerced into
the caucus scheme.: Â:??:
The Senatorial situation is very dis
tressing to the "medicine men". in the
Legislature. . They know that Grant
has more than a barrel of money and
that Burns has a mine, and they know
also that detectives a r e so closely
watching the foremost candidates that
neither dares spend a dollar to advance
his cause. It is a remarkable fact that
there is not amanaging agent in the

mainly a matter of bridges. The bridges
over Putato Creek, the present boundary,
are the care of ;â  both ; counties, but the
farmers said they had not been .decently
repaired in years and what r had been dorte

CALL HEADQUARTERS. '' SACRA
MENTO. Feb. Assemblyman McKeen
admitted this afternoon at the. meeting
of the Alameda County -delegation that
he was in a trance when by the casting
of his vote last Friday evening he cut
the number of deputies asked for by J.
Cal Ewing, Auditor of Alameda County,
from two to one. The admission did not
appear to have the desired effect upon
the delegation and apparently did' not
leave the majority of the members in the
least doubt that that very eminent
statesman was in a possible temporary
or perhaps permanent hypnotic state.
When the delegation was called to-or
der, ! McKeen took the floor and stated
that he thought he must have been in a
trance when he voted "no" to the motion
allowing - Ewing a second deputy, as it
had been his intention to vote "aye" and
he was of the impression that he had
done so , and that he was still â of that
impression and wanted to have the rec
ords examined. This was done and Mc-
Keen found' to be recorded as votine
"no." He â  then stated that the secre
tary, Assemblyman Kelly, had recorded

' After some, other, business the â¢ Ewing:
matter again. came up. through a commuhi
cation from .Mr.- Ewing asking the delega
tion to allow him three extra clerks dur
ing the time the Auditor Is compelled-: to"

present." county government -law-he. was
allowed but $500, arid that- the expense, has
heretofore exceeded. $1550,. and that as' ..is

tice for .the State to compel him to. do the
work but or? his own pocket? A motion
was then .'made to have the entire allow
ance made the Auditor the last roeet

The delegation also took up- the matter
of Sheriff Oscar Rogers," who was granted
what he wished at the.- last meeting With
the exception * of, mileage in the perform
ance of his duties. when on civil cases and
a. motion was made, to have the -matters
appertaining to his -office reconsidered.*
The delegation- was more magnanimous
in Rogers' case than in that of Ewing's,

By the opposition to reconsideration : in

to â¢ become I nettled, for *he made fa : warm
speech.'in, which he said that as reconsid

vote "no" on any other . proposition â¢ that
might come up or. reconsideration. . This
evidently put a quietus to a number of
other matters': of which there was some
talk of reconsideration. The' case of

38 votes, for it on the first try,, but he de
manded a call of the absentees and ran
the number up to' 40. Then he demanded
a call of the House, and Grovel Johnson
of Sacramento came over and- so did
Lundquist of San Francisco, making him
one vote to the good. When the bill was
known to have won there was a scramble
among the noes to change their votes

shut off by: the announcement . that the
bill had won by a vote of ft to 15. .

7 CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 13.â D. M. Burns believes
that if he gets a caucus he can suc
ceedj by methods peculiar -'to; himself
and his political backer, the Southern
Pacific Company, in securing for him
self the caucus nomination for United
State Senator- '/-. â¢'= â¢:
But there Will he no caucus. The cor
poration own- and controlled by
Huntington has shown its hand, and as
a result there Is an expressed deter
mination on the part of the majority
of; the legislators, Âutsi-le of the little
handful of Burns followers, not to go
into caucus now or at any other time.
This determination is based on: a belief
that the people of the State will be Well
served, and that the legislators; will
be doing their full duty to themselves
and their constituents if they take
such action as will prevent the : election
of Burns.
Here are a few of the many expres
sions of opinion concerning the? mat
ter:
ASSEMBYMAN, A. S. CROWÂ£)ER-I
am unequivocally opposed to a Secret
caucus on the Senatorial question, i
will, never consent to go into -one so
long; as 1 believe that Burns: has .the"
slightest show of becoming the caucus,
nominee. Such a result 1 would consid
er a calamity. ; .'-â¢- â¢"-"â â  -Ty ;'/
SENATOR W. M. CUTTERâ
will be; no caucus. We all understand
why :! Burns wishes .'-caucus, and yoU
may say for me that there will never
be one .7 I will never 'consent to go; into":
a caucus while Burns is a candidate.
ASSEMBLYMAN L. H. VALEN
TINEâI am opposed to any kind of a
caucus and I will never become a party
to one. This whole caucus scheme is
a trap set by Burns to get the majority
members of the Legislature to Join in
an agreement to; allow -him? to secure
the Senatorial plum by false pretenses
HERRIN ; "WELL, DANNY, I GUESS THE f TRAP WON'T , WORK."
I Will not now nor at any. other time
consent to the holding of a caucus.
ASSEMBLYMAN A. E. MUENTERâ
I will not go into a caucus. I am not
only opposed. to the caucus scheme as
it Is now being urged by the organs of
the Southern Pacific Company, but my !
constituents are also opposed to it, as j
they know full well that Burns would, {
by. some, means, capture the caucus and j
thus secure his election as United .
States Senator. My people do not want
Burns for Senator and they .do . not I
want a caucus.
? ASSEMBLYMAN W. H. LA BAREE '.
7âl : am .not in favor of a caucus now - .
or. at any other time? The real intent
of this caucus scheme is apparent, and
I. will not be a party to It.
ASSEMBLYMAN E. T. COSPER-I
believe that the 'way to break the dead
lock is by a caucus- I have heard this
talk of Burns' secret strength? but I do
not believe he has it. I do not believe
he can bey elected with or Without a

here on the steamship Olympia regarding a conspiracy formed in Peking jg
for the purpose "of killing the Emperor of Japan. . According to the in- g
formation an assassin was employed for that purpose and dispatched to g|
Japan. The assassin was in the employ of the Chinese Government. .3
The report reached Japan and caused a great sensation. The Emperor's g
palace is strongly guarded and all strangers are placed under surveil- . gÂ»
lance. . A number of arrests of. suspects have been made. 'Â»
â¢' While the Peking Government strenuously denies all knowledge of the - *?
affair, yet according to the- newspapers it is intimated that some of- Â§
ficials holding; high places of trust in the government are responsible 0
for the plot, which had its origin shortly after the close of the China- Â§
Japan war. Knowledge of the attempt on the life of the Japanese Em- 5
peror has been in possession of both, governments fbr some time, but" 'n
was kept secret until January 25, when it leaked- out through diplomatic r *Â§

destroying 'consider abi^ property for J. :
B. 'I'n-adwcll, the Southern Pacific
agent,- and j also after a long fight in
the . courts, prevented his seizing any
more of: the State land on the beach
of Summerland. it-was then predicted
that ' Tread well had ceased land grab
bing only while waiting for the Legis
lature to ri;- â -â >, and pass some blind spe
cial legislation that would enable the
Southern Pacific? Company to acquire
the water front of Summerland. This
bill, introduced by Senator Gillette in
the Senate a few. days ago. is evidently
an act fathered by the Southern Pa
cific Company to enable? it to continue
seizing land and deprive other oil men
from the source of their wells.
Petroleum rights are taken up as
placers, and this act would enable any
brie to squat at any place on lands sub
ject to ebb and flow of the tide, no
matter how great a nuisance he might
create to the properties purchased and
improved in good faith, and no matter
how much he obstructed navigation, to
afford ' the facilities' for which the
United 7' States - granted these lands - to
the State.. .Not: only would this act
enable the Southern Pacific Company
to grab the water front of Summer
land, but it would result in the ruining
of beautiful resident sites along the
Santa Barbara beach.
The Southern "Pacific Company, with,
its usual method of getting underneath
the Legislature and concealing its pur
pose, has ' had this . bill introduced by
Senator Gillette, from Humboldt j Coun
ty under the pretense ' that it would
facilitate the working of the aurifer
ous black sands on the beach.
Beach, property holders fear 7 that,
.should this act become a law, the en
tire beach between this -city and Car
pinteria, through Summerland, would
soon be covered by unsightly oil-der
ricks, for it is known that every inch
of land in -that vicinity will yield oil
in paying quantities. This would af
fect the value of property very mate
rally, just as the development of oil
wells has damaged several localities in
the heart of Los Angeles.
The Santa Barbara County represen
tatives at Sacramento have been noti
fied of the true import*, of the bill and
will labor to defeat: it. A' prominent
attorney of this city will in all proba
bility . go to Sacramento immediately
to. work against its passage. ? The bill
is how. before both the Senate and As
sembly committees and would have
gone through both houses: easily had
it not been exposed by The Call, y â¢â â¢:

At the markets prices were advanced
from 25 to 100 per cent, when the scan
tiness of the supply and immensity of
the demand became manifest. Orders
from near by towns poured in and save
a fresh impetus, to the. advance. 7.. The
same conditions apply to the coal sup
ply, which is perilously scarce. The
article is being sold by the bushel,,
and dealers say the stock on hand is
exceedingly limited, while railway con- :
ditions make the outlook for shipments
Into the city very gloomy. y was an
nounce. this afternoon that-, the gas
supply was being rapidly exhausted
from the reserve tanks and the gas
company's supply of coal was so slen
der that it would have to be husband
ed most carefully. Consequently the
pressure was reduced. Many of the
street lamps were not lighted. The
electric lighting companies, . however,
are as yet maintaining a service. . â '?'?

There has not been during the day a

and with the gale prevailing to-night it
is dangerous for any one but. a strong
man to venture out. Many persons
have; been overcome by the cold, but no
fatalities have been reported within the
city limits. It is feared, however, that
there has been loss of life in the adja

night all entertainments have practical
ly been given up or postponed. Two of
the largest theaters did not open their
doors. One of the most serious phases
is the danger from fires. The fire de

Ice Causes the Big Liner to List
and Slowly Go to the
Bottom.
7 NEW YORK, Feb. 13â The White Star line. steamer Germanic sank
at her pier in North River this evening and is now lying there partly
submerged. The accident is said to have been due to the heavy coating
of ice which formed on the steamer. The continued loading of coal,
â¢â 'combined, with the heavy weight of the ice, caused the steamer, to list
and slowly sank to the bottom. , It is said that no one was injured.
The Germanic is resting on the bottom of what the sailor calls an

with ice, and when her cargo was emptied she was topheavy.
A large gang of men worked all day yesterday coaling the ship and
Were, at, this task when the accident occurred. . They say that most of
the coal was on the port side, which made the ship list.
A small hurricane struck the river at 9:30 p. m., causing the vessel
to roll -. away '". over : port, submerging the open coal holes and permit
ting her to ship a. great quantity of water into her bunkers.

AT THE CAPITAL
Causes a Slim Attend
ance in the House.
' Special Dispatch to The "Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â bliz
zard caused. practically a suspension of
business at the House to-day. The
great marble Capitol looked like a snow
palace. Ledges, facades, parapets were
banked with. snow". On the drives and
on the plaza in front of the building
the snow had drifted into. a. great bil
lows, in some places ten feet deep. Not
a car line approached the building,, but
a few members of .the House managed
to reach the Capitol, in carriages and
sleighs. The hall of. the House was as
dark as a cellar? The snow banked up
on the ground-glass ceilings, shut out
the light, and half an hour before noon
. â the hour for the House to' conveneâ
the lights were turned on to relieve the
gloom. The committee meetings, with
but one or two exceptions, were not
held. The few members of the House
who arrived had no thought for. any
thing save the weather?. They stood
about the weather map In the h.bby in
the rear of the hall discussing tempera
tures and snowfall and record-breaking
in all parts of the country, and it was
the unanimous verdict of the oldest,
members in the group that nothing ap
proaching the present cold spell and
snowfall had been known in f Washing
ton in their experience.. The nearest
approach to it was the blizzard of 18S8,
which cut Washintrton off for a week
from communication.' by railroad and
telegraph. .
7 Speaker Reed did not appear at the
Capitol, but sent word to his lieuten
ants that in his opinion it was inadvis
able to hold a session of the House-to
day, and after consulting several of
the majority General Henderson of
lowa, who had braved the storm, de
cided it would be the. best to adjourn
immediately after assembling. Some of
the Republican leaders were disposed
to go ahead with a session arid an at
tempt was made to communicate with
the Speaker, but he could" not be
reached at his hotel by telephone
'â At 12:05 p.m. Clerk McDowell' called the
House to order. .There were- about slxtv
members on the noor.. Payne moved that
the House adjourn, but there were cries
of "No" from the little .circle of members

the consideration, of the sundry civil bill.
Cannon asked unanimous consent that

Corliss made a similar request regard

A resumption of the dlscuslion of the
receipts and expenditures of the treasury,
which attracted considerable attention
last, week, was again precipitated. by Sul
zer, who offered some figures as to the
cost of the steamship subsidy bill.
Cannon reiterated his statement of last
week regarding the ship, subsidy, bill and
the Nicaraguan canal bill. â¢
* Payne ; chairman of the committee which
reported the subsidy -bill, said.- he wel
comed any information that would throw,
light upon the' bill, -.but he. protested
'against alarming statements as to- defi
ciencies in advance.. Estimates' did not
always coincide with appropriations. ; As
an illustration "he : cited the fact that the
estimates â¢ for the army bill had ranged
as high as $145,000,000,-' whereas the -Mili
tary Comritlttee had prepared a bill car
rying less than $80,000,000. He asked Can
non why he had' not thrown his influence
against the public buildings hills a : few
days ago. These bills; he said,- would
take, more money from the ' .treasury in

The wreck was caused by a broken rail. The train was running at a
high rate of speed, required by the schedule, and the locomotive and
several; cars were badly damaged.
7 When the news of the accident reached the city a wrecking crew
was sent to the scene and physicians were summoned from the nearby
towns. . The injured were removed from the -wreck and given as prompt
attention as the circumstances would permit? Ambulances were called
from the Homeopathic, : Mercy and West Pennsylvania hospitals and
were at the. station ready , to receive the injured. . The cold weather
caused- much suffering to the injured and to those who aided in their
removal. The train was composed of a baggage car, two day coaches
and a Pullman parlor, car. . All were vestibuled. and it was one of the
crack, trains on the road, making the trip from Cleveland in three hours.
It is believed that the broken rail was one of the effects of the ex
treme cold. This is the first accident that has occurred in this part of
the country since the cold weather began.
- : 7 ' The train left Cleveland at 11:18 a. m, and ran on time to Youngs
town. At that point two hours were lost and the train ran on a siding
near Fleming Park to let another train pass.. In running off the switch
the; rail broke and the locomotive was thrown from the track and turned
over on its side. The tender ran on for several hundred yards before
the air brakes took effect. 'Â. = ' _ ' 7 '

.was' not. very .heavy to-day there' was

enough .coal and provisions and ar
rangements have been iriade there to
send food to outside districts.
â  Two prospectors on snowshoes ; ar
rived in Leadville to-day from Wheeler;
It took them four days to make the trip
of fourteen miles. There is enough food
at Wheeler and " other towns- around
' Kokomo â  and Dillon to last teri days,
with care. Potatoes, flour and salt pork
are the articles of diet. . '
.. Stock is suffering, and between eighty
and ninety â¢ head of horses '.between
Wheeler and Leadville have . scarcely
any food whatever. . An effort will be
made to dig a road across the mount

main- line^ef- the Rio Grande? in order
to supply the towns between- Kokomo
and .Leadville, should the South Park
remain unable to clear the higher line

LONDON, Feb. 13.â Lloyds' agent at

steamer Weehawken : reports that the
Bulgaria, when; spoken on February 5,
in latitude 40, longitude 43, was in a
sinking condition, with three holds full
of water, her rudder broken and her
machinery disabled. The agent says
the Weehawken lost her boats and ar
rived with her bunkers full of water.
The agents of the Hamburg
can Steamship Company here admit
that the last news of the Bulgaria's
condition when sighted by the Wee- â¢
hawken is graver than they had at first
supposed developments would show.
They are still hopeful, however, that
the rest of the crew and passengers
have been rescued by other steamers
in the vicinity.
The Daily Mail to-morrow will pub
lish a dispatch from Ponta del Gada,
Azore Islands, saying that the Bulgaria
had a crew of ninety-eight and carried
forty-one passengers, and that the
Weehawken rescued twelve members of
the crew and eleven passengers.

HOLD THE FORT.
ALL . signs aud /portents 0 the Senatorial con- y
test point to- the conclusion that Burns and -
. . Herrin: ..will- .make ;.their7final7._esperate Assault.?,
upon tlie rankv. of stanch Republicans in?the?-Legis-.?
â  lature early, thi-: week;. The effort of. the gang will v
be to carry out the nefarious caucus scheme. Order-*
;. ior the programme, have been issued not; only yby'the;.
secret nttho'i-,01 the bosses, but openly through the
railroad organs. It is now to be seen who will stand
.firmly for the honor of the Republican .party and trie
oigny\ of the State, arid who will ennge at the dicta
tion of the Southern Pacific Company
If the. fortunes of. Burns were not desperate .'the"-'rail'i--? :?
road would not thus openly order its forces to his
support. It is not for nothing the Record-Union
yand all the railroad newspapers have become sud
denly so emphatic i:i demanding a caucus ' ; an/: V'so'-"' ?
earnest in sohciting from citizens an expression oi
opinion favorable to holding one. . These things sig
nify that every attempt to gain votes for Burn? by
cajolery has failed and thatnow the screws are to be
put on. The legislators are to be bulldozed if ppo- y
fible. 1 he. Southern Pacific cracks the whip and or- i
ders the reprcs.ntames of. the peopie to pass. into a!
caucus y here they can be bound over to Burns,
-.Inythia situation of affasrs the majority of the Re
publicans in the Legislature have only to stand firm
to scheve a notable victory for the honor of Cah-
â  iorma. for decency in politics, for honesty,' for in
t.gr"t : Vi. ?or all that Republicanism stands for: The
ejection -of Burns would: be a defeat of every aspira
tion oi the party founded in righteousness and haying
its best exemplar in the character of Lincoln. With
what credit to themselves,, their party, or their State
could, the Republicans of the Legislature send; to
.Washington as their representative, the disgraced
Clerk of Yolo, the. lilting Secretary of State, the
malodorous confidence operator of Candelaria? /;-;.
Burns and Herrin arc skilled in all the trickery that
cunning teaches in the management of politics They
know how to concoct an appearance of public senti
ment in favor of any scheme they desire to promote
and for weeks they have been at work fabricating such
a show of approval for. the caucus- scheme. 7 - An ef
fort was made to induce the Republican County Com
mittees to urge a caucus, but that failed Now the
railroad sets to work. All the organs grind the
same tune. It is caucus, caucus, caucus? all along- the
line; while over the din of the cry can be heard the
cracking of the monopoly whip in the Record-Union
and the loud denunciation of the opponents of the
scheme â_ traitors and scoundrels.
For the genuine Republicans of the Legislature the
hour that is to test. their manhood has come. - It is
row to be seen whether. they will remain true to their
pledges to the people and break the Southern Pacific
domination in our politics or submit to it. betray '"â ]
their party and disgrace California by electing to the
Senate such a map as the exposed rascal whom Hunt
ington has taken up as his candidate for the office. I
To these true Republicans is now intrusted the duty j'
of guarding the advanced post of the great party 1
against the combined forces of political and corporate '
corruption^ From all over the State Republicans,
look to them to keep aloft the standard of party prin
ciple. They must hold the fort.

A PLEA FOR JUSTICE.
SENATE bill 433, which is designed to regulate
a very objectionable feature of the; business of
the S-tn Francisco gas corporations, was re
turned on; Wednesday last by the Senate Committee
on Corporations with an adverse report, ' We have
commented; upon this measure once beforey and on
that occasion took- pains to fully explain its pur
port. The bill does not change, the present law
in any respect, except that it makes contracts for: -de
posits as a condition precedent to placing: meters
invalid and of no effect.
The law is demanded by the people of San Fran
cisco, in whose interest it is; drawn 'and for. whose
benefit, it ought to be parsed. 1- There is nothing:: un
reasonable about â  it. The gas companies have no
more right to exact a deposit for meters than, they
have to require their. hills to; be. : paid: iri advance'; No â 
Other, corporations dealing with, public utilities pre-?
sume to exercise any such privilege and pone of them
have ever attempted to exercise' it, either directly or
indirectly. - , -
Perhaps the adverse report made upon this measure
by, the Senate cotiimitt.ee has . been, induced by? the
large number of "cinch" bills introduced, at this 'ses-.
.si.ori.,irid referred to it. These: ".cinches;'. _re intended
tc bring into the lobby practically every corporation
and individual engaged, in business in the State. : The
insurance companies? the; .railroad companies, ? the
water companies, the .undertakers, the butchers arid
bakers, the candlestick-makers, -the stenographers
and; the pawnbrokers are attacked by the wholesale
and in detail. '* ; . *?';. " ;: 7
Naturally, when a proposition .to-bleed the business
men of the State in this. way; is presented to the Com
mittee on Corporations of the Senate its members
are. driven in the opposite direction. .? They may con
sider Senate bill 433 a "cinch," but if they do we beg
to inform th<*m that it is no ' such .thing .It is de
signed to impose upon the gas corporations a rule
which they ought to adopt voluntarily themselves, If
passed it will not deprive them of a single dollar of
legitimate income. Their business will not be dam
aged in any way whatever. â¢ They -will collect' just as
much from the public as they ever did. If they can

whatever 1 in collecting their, bills by .'the . proposed
statute: we in. advocate the addition of an amendment
which will giv6 em alien upon personal property in
.the nature of: a material, man's lien. â¢ But nothing of
-.this sort' will be v necessary.. "7 The. gas.; companies will
get- .their '.bills', and if they do not, the. law authorizes
them to. shut, off the gas; â '.'
We.hope the Senate 1 wili disregard this adverse re-.

by the gas consumers of San Francisco. :-/'/
DEMOCRATIC DISINTEGRATION.
'â ' ' I : 'ME disintegration 7 of : the Democratic party
,1 c eetns to be al'moft complete Its organization
.was Abandoned in. 1896. by many .thousands pi
its members "who : preferred a sound currency to
party success arid who detected: the -socialistic features
.(7 the : Chicago platform and of Mr. Bryan's speeches.
In the State election of last year the insidious and
7d-in._;e.rous attack. Upon our. institutions, made in the
; name of. Democracy, were repelled by a still "larger
; number of patriotic : Democrats, who voted Repub
lican tickets? even though objecting to leading fea
tures ;in Republican platforms. In California/espe
cially,* the election of Mr. .Gage and his associates
was. effectively, aided by Democratic ballots, which
were cast for that ticket in sufficient numbers to deter
mine the result.' â â /â â . *'" I '7? ' ... â  i'y
The greatest statesmen and the best element, in. the
Democratic party are the seceders of 1806 and 1898?
Many of those, gentlemen, however,'; anticipate the
restoration of their party to a national basis in 1900.
. All present signs indicate that they will ; be . dis
appointed. The strifes for leadership in the ? dis
organized Democracy are acute arid virulent beyond
all previous experience and grow out of fundamental
.antagonisms as well as personal ambition. After a
ridiculous assumption of national authority? the. black
type and magnified letters, through Which the'Jour
\ nal-Examiner attempts to disguise its weakness, and
its lack of influence, are now devoted to a pretended
j ..dictatorship over the divided remnants of the party
i that has rejected GiOver Cleveland and all those who
â¢ere in unison with him. But even this dictatorship.
: which, if it existed, might confer upon the proletarian
: organ the bloated proportions of a toad in a puddle,
'.': onlya. monstrous- delusion, which attaches to the
['â  Journal-Examiner its own phrase of "blunderer arid
i. egotist." Following the lines of The Call and other
â¢ leading newspapers and of the most eminent â¢ and
powerru! . Republican statesmen' and debaters, Mr.
Bryan;. has denounced imperialism, and is classed,
..therefore, among the "little Americans," "who must
tyca^d out of. the way" because they deny that "the
flag of the Union is nailed to , the flagpole of the
Philippines?' Mr. Bryan, . however, still embraces
the putrid corpse of free silver at 16 to 1. and, there-
Jpfe, still holds one foot in the Journal-Examiner's
cbarncl house. Richard Crokcr, the Tammany boss,
holds that the free silver issue is dead, but favors ex
pansion. . He and Bryan, therefore/ are diametrically
Opposed to each other and yet two of their feet are
side by side Stephen M. White/ whose patriotism
.-.nd whose integrity have commanded th. general
esteem of* the Senate of the United States and of the
American people, has denounced Asiatic expansion
in .very form and has never shown much enthusiasm
on behalf, of a depreciated currency: He -is charged
with having "misrepresented his party arid his State"
and has been invited to take a back seat with, the
other statesmen, jurists and patriots, who have been
relegated to the kingdom of Ljliput by the Journal-
Examiner in its favorite .character of Bombastes
Furiosp/ :: ; .y.y -.-â /;? 7? ? y, ...''.-' - Y : y' : -' â¢
;"-. The Democracy? as we have illustrated, is divided
into five sets: Those who.are opposed to free silver and
expansion and all the other socialistic excrescences
pi the last three years: those who are opposed to free
silver and expansion, but in favor of the other pro
letarian features of recent platforms; those who are
opposed to free silver, but. in favor of expansion:
those who -oppose expansion and favor free silver
and those who favor both. free 'silver and expansion.
Amidst these radical discordancies, no note of har
mony can possibly be struck, and the journalistic
bully, which has been false ' to Democracy ; and to
everything that is constitutional and American, will
find its lash stinging. its' own shoulders and not driv
ing Democratic sheep into the. lair, of imperialistic
and socialistic wolves. -These wanderers will prob
ably find refuge in the Republican fold. .
PIGGOTT AND HIS PULL.
'HERE is a fellow named Piggott; a record of
-.1 ". whose . arrests for picking pockets, forms a
. * standard part of the daily news. ;. A close stu
dent of local affairs, looking, over the papers? is never'
surprised to see mention Of one of these arrests, but
the absence; of such mention, or, the assertion that
the arrest, had been followed by trial, and punishment,
would strike him. with astonishment..". For Piggott
possesses a pull of great value. '
Individually Piggott is not an impressive person,
being simply an adroit and vulgar thief, the associate
of vagrants and thugs; but as the lucky representative
of.the criminal world, at freedom to loot the non
criminal,; and thereafter to twiddle his thumbs in con
tempt at' any presumptuous threat of punishment, he .
becomes.- worth inspection.?. .
There is no difficulty in understanding how a poli
tician can, by doing.shady things, acquire an influence
; sufficient to help him out of a tight place, but how the
Piggott sort can openly follow a career of law-break
ing and suffer no -inconvenience even when his guilt
is open arid palpable is a mystery. He belongs in
Sap Quentin. Any one of a dozen or so offenses he
has. committed would have been sufficient to have
sent another thief there For crimes of less wanton
ness? men impelled by actual, want are now serving
â¢terms varying from twenty to forty years.
â¢ Who backs Piggott, and why? An analysis of the
. situation ? would be of . interest,- and . perhaps em
; barrassing, but if this larcenous hoodlum continues
' bigger than . the police ..and' .more. 'potent than, the
courts, the public, will iiltiriiately want "to .know-all
about it. There is a growing curiosity, and we think
a proper, One, concerning the source arid purpose of -
.that remarkable pull. â '" V .-?â¢.â¢

A 'correspondent -asks . further infor
: mation as to a recent statement; in this
I department that eggs can be produced
lat a cost of . 6 cents a dozen. Our au-
I thority is the following, found, in The
I Poultry Keeper: . "Experiments '. in
i feeding and in computing the value of
! eggs show that, if no estimate is made
i for labor, one dozen eggs can be pro
| duced at a cost of 6 cents for food, or
| about half a cent an egg. - If all the
â  food allowed to hens were converted
i into eggs the profit on a dozen eggs
J would be large, even when the prices
i are low, but much depends on whether
| hens convert their ?food into eggs, flesh
lor mere support of their bodies.. It is
a fact -demonstrated, . however, ; that
when a dozen eggs are marketed they
! carry from the farm but little of the
! nutritious elements of the soil In pro
i portion to their market value, and on
that account they are as profitable as
anything that can be produced on the.
farm." If our inquirer is a poultry
keeper he can, by keeping a simple
debit and credit account with his henÂ».
charging them .with what they eat and
crediting them with the money received
for their eggs, easily find out. the cost
and profit of producing eggs, and with
that knowledge can experiment in eco
nomics.

BUNKO BAIN WEEPS
CROCODILEAN TEARS
ADDRESSES U. S. ATTORNEY A
LETTER FOR PARDON. 7 :
Afraid That His Lady Friend Mrs.
Allison Will Not Like Life in
'. the Penitentiary. . .?. ?
Isaac W. Bain, convicted for the third
time of using the mails in his bunko mat
rimonial, Scheme to defraud the amorous
I bachelor from the . country, is shedding
: tears of the crocodile variety in the Ala-
I meda Jail. He has, with much perspiration
of brow, written a letter to the United
States Attorney squealing for a pardon
with the earnestness of a pig whose ten
der tali has been pinched under, a gate.
He says that if . the District Attorney
will ask the President of the United
States to pardon him and Mrs. Grace Alli
son, alias Quinn, alias Collins, alias
Smith, he and the lady of many aliases
will not appeal and will take their medi
cine if so be it the President decides to
allow them to .serve; their fifteen months'
imprisonment in the penitentiary . at San
Quentin.
He drew a grewsome picture of the
lady going insane because, of the strong
contrast between her life of oysters and
champagne with the: Dr. Allisons arid the
other dupes and her present life in the
County Jail of: Alameda with beans three
times a day and no tamale* and beer.
He winds up his letter with the state
ment that when he. shall have finished
his term of imprisohrrient he will go to
Mexico and lead "the same quiet, blame-;
less life that I ted before.'* â  ?â¢;
In view of the fact that he has been
convicted three times the latter statement
is rather ironical. . 'â¢ . . -â¢â¢."â¢' â _â ?
Assistant United States Attorney Ban
ning says he will not recommend the par
don of either Bain or the woman. He has
obtained an order of. execution on the

money put up by the' defendant. y
MRS. KRELING WINS. -
'â  Manager Nash Loses â¢ His . Suit on a
Breach of Contract.
The action of John E. Nash against Mrs.
Ernestine Kreling. owner "of the Tivoli
Opera House, to recover $1150 which he
claimed as due on a contract, was de
cided adversely to the plaintiff yesterday
by the Supreme Court.? According to the?
complaint in the original action Nash was ::
in the East in 1&94, and Mrs. Kreling
wished to engage his services as manager
of. the Tivoli. He demanded 510) a week
on a two-year contract, but she offered
$75 for the first year and $100 for the next -..;
yefcr;- This, according to his version, was
refused, but he consented to compromise
upon the understanding that she would
pay $90 a week for the first year and $100
for the second.. â¢â¢
In the lower court Nash; produced tele
grams and letters which he claimed were
equivalent' to a contract, for in one of the
dispatches, the owner of the opera house
wired an acceptance of the $90 per week
proposition, and added that a contract
could be made when Nash reached this
city. The written contract was never
made out, and at the end of ten months
she gave the manager his walking papers,
i claiming that he did not come up to the
; requirements and was neglectful of his
duties.. .
The jury in the lower court found that
the dispatch mentioned was not sufficient
to constitute a contract and that Manager
Nash was not entitled to recover. The
Supreme Court refused to disturb the
findings of the jury and the judgment and
order were affirmed.

Considerable anxiety is felt for the.
safety of the well-known schooner W. S.
Phelps. She Is how out thirty-three days
. from Sap Pedro; for. Eureka, arid has ..not'
been sighted since leaving port. ';.. It ? is 7
feared that she was. caught in one of the
southeasters' or northwesters that, paged
; last month and may. have : gone down
..with all hands. Some old ship captains
think she may have, lost her sails and is
drifting around 'somewhere off .shore;
Others, again, point to the fact that the
Phelps was in ballast and that she may:
have turned turtle, like the; Nomad, which
went ashore on the island of Hawaii last
month. Still others assert that the
schooner "opened up" during heavy
weather and went down. The .Phelps was
built In 1870, but was always considered
a seaworthy vessel. â â â  7" ''-''â â . /7 : â  â

this was a violation of lav.*, ; He asks that
the commission investigate the matter
and that if the charge is found to be sus
tained the- charter of the offending:com
pany be declared forfeited. The case was
set for hearing at 2 o'clock p. m. to-day.

ten miles, and $1 75 between Colusa Junc

He claimed that this was exorbitant and
asked the commission to reduce these
rates.. In answer to the complaint the

the ' company was operating at a loss
and had never paid any dividends. The
case Was set for hearing on March 14 at

Islais Creek to the east bay shore. This,
when constructed; will drain Ocean View,

REDUCE SEVERAL
APPROPRIATIONS
Hall of Justice Gets
j $20,000 Less.
DEPLETED FUNDS ARE FILLED
STRUGGLE OVER APPOINTMENT
OF AN EXPERT.
Members of the Board Differ as to. the
y.. Necessity, at This Time, of : :
â¢ an Expert on As- â¢
â¢ . ' sessments. â¢
The plan of the. Finance Committee,
Board: of Supervisors, to replenish a num
ber, of special funds depleted by their
predecessors was adopted at a meeting of
the- board- yesterday. Chairman Perrault
of the â¢ committee â  was . the most active
champion of the measure. The Only de
termined opposition came. from Supervis
or .Holland, who. as chairman of the
Building Committee, is charged with the
furnishing of the Hall of justice.
. The appropriation' of $85,000 for this pur
pose was reduced by 20,000, and he claimed:
this would not only prevent the proper
: furnishing of the building, but would also
cause a delay, in its completion ready for
occupancy. [When the resolution was read
he objected to its passage. In support of
his stand in the matter he read a com
munication from Shea & Shea, the archi
tects of the . building. This told of the
proper furnishing and equipment, neces
sary for the building and. asked that the
present amount- stand? Mr. Holland also
spoke in behalf of the building, saying
he hoped the board would not interfere
with the progress, being made on the
building, but let It continue and have It
ready for occupancy on July 1.
He held that alterations of the. rooms to
be occupied by the Superior Judges and
other things would consume the entire
appropriation. â¢
Dr. Perrault in reply said $45,000 instead
of $65,000 should be sufficient to furnish
the building. He j told of the city being
indebted to merchants, street contractors,
clerks, laborers and others, and that
economy. was necessary. He thought the
furniture now used by the Judges could
be brightened with polish and- installed
in their, hew quarters. : The doctor- said
the people have become disgusted with
the Hall of Justice and its contractors
during the past two years. He wanted
to maintain the "credit of the city and
build up its depleted funds. :
-The resolution cutting. down the appro
griations was carried by a vote of 8 to 4.
upervisor' Holland volunteered the state
ment that if the Finance Committee had
consulted the Building Committee, the
specifications for - the furnishing could,
have been changed before.
Alfred CÂ«- Piatt was appointed expert to
the Committee on "Personal Property As
sessments" of the board. He will aid the
committee nits examination of the as
sessments on the assessment book. His
I remuneration was fixed at $150 per month..
This appointment was considered uhtime
lv by Supervisors- Byington and Deasy, as
they said the work would not commence
â¢ until July. 1 To this Dr. Perrault replied
that the man would be engaged in "detec
tive duties" from this forth. He said
there was $6,000,000 floating taxes, and. the
duty of this expert would be to see that
; they were paid. â¢' ... " ' ,

At the instance; of Chairman Holland of

A charge of vagrancy has been pending
in Judge Graham's court against Childs
and Piggott. for the past four, month-*
The case was heard by a jury, and the
iury. disagreed. Since then no effort" ha"
been made to again try them. There
Is, also a charge of vagrancy in the same
court against Piggott, who was arrested
by Policeman Barney Harter about ten
days ago. but. it Is also undisposed of
Piggott, like his sister Annie, one. of the
cleverest pickpockets that ever operated

other Day. . y
Every public school teacher In "the city
was: represented in Treasurer Truman's
office yesterday, between 9 a. m. and 4 p.
m., arid during this interval of seven hours
a golden . stream of $78 202 15 flowed out
through the cashier's little wcket at the
rate of about $186 20 per minute. So the
tide ran away toward every, point of the
compass and there was Joy in twelve hun
dred homes last night.. The safety dead
lock was broken and a part of the city's
shame was sponged from the record. By
the unwritten law, the salary of a teacher
engaged in educating the young is as stat
utory as the hills, and this is why public
sentiment' called loudly for its immediate
payment.? â¢' '. ' y.
Many of the hundreds of teachers stand
ing quietly around the .treasurer's door
early yesterday morning were keyed up
to a high nerve tension. There was. a
sense of impending something in the air.
The clocks were moving towards 9, and at
j 10 the courts would be open for business.
Would the dread injunction. then swoop
I down on the paymaster and tie up ' the
[ coin sacks again?- Even passers-by were
! affected. Officers whose salaries are stat
utory and not at the mercy Of the unholy :
I public boards of San Francisco, where
post-election sainthood so ouickly devel
! ops Into official deviltry most rich and
! rare/stopped a moment and were caught.
!in the spirit of trembling expectancy. A
policeman who was there to defend the
remainder of this fiscal year's school
funds from any flank attack on- the part
of Ragan, Weller & Co.. was taken with
an attack of nervous' prostration, arid
was only an ornament in that locality
during the rest of the forenoon. But the
treasury doors opened, the salaries began
to come out, the Injunction was enjoined,
and January's work was paid for.
A citizen in a communication received
a: this office asks for information regard
ing the goods furnished by the merchant
creditors to the city during the malad
ministration of the late Board of Educa
tion. In answer, it can be stated that
these claims, numbering about 200, run
from $20,870 down to $1 60. One bill of $18,-'
164 is for desks, chairs arid other school
supplies purchased from C. F. Weber &
Co. It has been said that much of this
furniture being greatly In excess of needs
was stored to get it out of the way. The
$1 50 claim belongs to Miss Annie B.
Chalmers, principal of the Edison Pri
mary school. This is one Instance where
a teacher creditor Is a merchant creditbr,
but as Miss Chalmers has won her Jan
uary salary she will willingly forget the
lost 41 50 claim: The bill for $20,870 is for
Remington typewriters, about 300 of them,
at something like $70 apiece. They were
furnished by wyckoff. Seamans & Bene
dict. 211 Montgomery street. With this
ample supply of machines : on hand, San
.Francisco should turn out A.B. graduates
of typewritery till the school department
catches up with its runaway finances. Al
exander & Co. supplied $1700 worth of
typewriters, but soon after they were de
livered the firm learned. that the board
was dealing in futures. By good luck the
machines were recovered before Ragan &
Co. got them corralled, and the firm is
congratulating Itself. ' â â --â¢â¢
Payot, Fpham & Co.'s claim is for school
supplies amounting to $3293, and the Sari
Francisco Gas and Electric Light Com
pany is in the hole for $2110.. The Hum
boldt Lumber Company, at $1051, and the
Slade Lumber Company, at $1291, and the.
lumber firm of J. A. Snook & Co.. at $1755,
are the builder merchants whose bills are
hung up to frazzle out in the wind: These
are the larger bills. The others go down
the line, a large number in the lower hun
dreds, and many in the tens, showing
that a host of small tradesmen were
caught dealing with this debt-repudiating
municipality; A large sprinkling of claims
under *10, running down to $3. are on the
list. All of the city newspapers are rep
resented by advertising: bills of from $15
to $25. - ' ; â Ââ¢?,
Ex-Auditor Broderick is not alarmed by
the reported intention of : the merchant
creditors to question the propriety of his
action in signing . illegal claims. He is
willing to stand by his official record, no
matter what rascality the Boards of Su
pervisors and Education were guilty of.
Said a prominent citizen yesterday: "If
Broderick is to be crucified as the out

BIGGS,: Feb. 13.â After the morning re

heard In the girls' room, and, upon In
vestigation, a hobo was found attempting
to make an assault upon an eight-year
old'school girl. When discovered he ran
away, followed by the larger boys on
horses. He threatened to kill any per
son who attempted to capture him.
7 Professor Stout and others procured
guns and the villain surrendered quickly.
He was taken before his little Victim, who
identified him. Then he was locked up,
pending an examination to-morrow. This
afternoon he attempted to cut his way
out of the lock-up with a large knife that
had been passed to him from the outside
by some person. A bunch of skeleton
keys was In his cell. Upon: search
ing his blankets the oincers found an
overcoat and two laprobes stolen from the
school building earlier in the day.
The citizens are very much excited to
think their young daughters are not safe,
even while attending school, from the as

teaching that clement that Biggs from
now on will not be a safe place for It.

first jump, and Ballister. fell in taking this
same obstacle. Tyro, the Corrigan entry,
went to the post favorite, with T. Mur
phy up, and the stable connections spread
the coin about the ring.on "the lepper" In
liberal potations. The gelding finished
third, after once looking a promising can
didate? In ! taking the last leap, y well
bunched, Joe Cotton, Tyro and Major S.
knocked the abbreviated piece of brush
and fencing down. Mattier, on Tom Smith,
an outsider? took advantage of the open
ing with the green one, and outfooting the
others on the" flat, . downed Major S a
: neck, with the favorite only a head fur
ther away. . The whole thing was a reve
lation, and caused no amount of talk.
The favorites spent a dismal afternoon
of it. All were rated and corked up tight,
with the exception of Prompto, and he
was a sluggish choice. Only a fair crowd
was in attendance, and the betting .was
rather light. y
Louis Ez.U's Hanover-Eloise filly â Win
yah. took the three-furlong scramble,
starting at odds of 5 to Tanobe and the
favorite, St. Agnes, leu into the stretch,
whefe-Heririessy oh Wlnyah slipped to the
front and won easily. . In a. drive; the first
choice, led Tanobe out. a head for- .the
place. .--...----
The Eaklns people -again played Dave
Gideon's big disappointment for a . i mi
"killing," and cashed. . The chestnut glid-
. ing was among the twelve starters in. the
third number, : a â¢ five furlong . dash, - .- d
was. backed down from 6 to 3 to 1. Get*
ting away well to a poor start. Hennessy.
kept him in front? and he. won ridden 'out.
from 7 Silver State. Einstein, the. favorite,
away badly, finished in the. show. :
7 The six furlong, selling affair that: fol
lowed was a most open : betting race,
Prompto with Martin up r having a slight
call in the ring at post time. Martin was
away well With his mount, arid in front
most of the time, downed Good Hope at
the end in a hard drive.: The â¢ -Fretter.
looked dangerous, at the stretch *urn, but
tired, taking the small end of the purse.
.The Capture of the. mile and a quarter
selling run by' Mistletbn, 7 ridden.by. Bull
man, was not . wholly Unexpected; .The
Brutus; horse; at odds of 7.t0.2, headed his
field In the stretch, and though; given -an
argument by Lady Hurst, disposed of .the
mare cleverly by a length. The Bachelor,
a receding favorite; contented himself
with the show.
â  Everybody. strung their checks pn-Mon-'
tallade In the final six furlong sprint to
get even. Ryan's horse never looked dan
gerous, finishing In third place. Butler on
Cyril rode a very pretty, race, and; getting
up to Mldlight shortly before the wire was.'
reached, earned the verdict by nearly,
a length. The winner was 5 to i in the:
betting.. : â ".:-. â  'â  ' â¢

Brown .'lived between Gray and-Green.
Green was .as Quiet a Neighbor as you
could wish to have, and so was Gray "for
that matter, but he had . a barking dog
that- was the torment of Brown's life. One
day in his. desperation he told Gray that
"if he would get rid. of the dog he would
give him. $5? "AH' right," said Gray,"l'll
do it." Meeting Gray downtown that af- '
te.rnocfn Brown : asked,- "Have you done
wharyQu agreed to do. and got-rid of 1
that dogT' GrayâYes, I've got rid.of him.
BrownâThank goodness. Now. I shall
sleep nights.' By the way, what did you .
dp with him? Grayâl- sold, him to Green
He gave-me $3for him. Not so bad, ehâ

â¢ Sentiment in favor of the proposed Pacific Ocean Exposition
to be held in San Francisco in 1901 grows with each succeeding
day... Every" stage in the preliminary work brings out more promi
nently its desirability and feasibility. It is now being generally
conceded by the men most interested in the commercial and gen
eral material prosperity of California that an equal amount of
money could not be more advantageously expended than in the
establishment and maintenance of a big fair.

nation, if these amounts were . reduced
considerably. . nevertheless, they would

of a much greater, a more Instructive and
v more beneficial exposition than the Mid
winter Exposition. .' '.:
"The total cash expenditure for the con
duct of the Omaha Exposition by Its
management aggregated about $1,400,000.
The results of the Omaha Exposition
were such as to justify those interested
in the prosperity of Omaha in seeking to
have the fail continued annually.
"These two expositions, the Midwinter
and the Omaha, are the latest examples
which would furnish accurate informa
tion as to ; the cost of holding the con
templated Pacific Ocean Exposition.
"1 here are other considerations In the
expenditure of sums of money by mu
nicipalities than the mere comparison oi
the money paid with the amOunt of
money received. There are many Indi

State pays out: annually enormous sums

advantages of which do not show in any
particular place nor in any way. in which
they can be computed, and similarly,
many of the improvements which go to
make up a high state of civilization are
difficult : to trace in money returns or
financial advantages. So It will be with
the Pacific Ocean Exposition.

of an enormous commerce and a great
civilization. The State of California is
about to enter upon the fiftieth year of
its admission into the Union, and at this
time many circumstances go to show the
wisdom of this prediction, and in carry
ing out the prophecy San Francisco will
be an important factor.
"If this city never receives a dollar of
money return immediately from the hold
ing of the exposition, nevertheless, if it
is properly carried out, it can be made to
furnish such an object lesson to the world
as would impress upon everybody the per
manent place of this city as the United
States; metropolis for that vast expected
commerce, and that alone would redound
to the city's advantage in tenfold the
amount expended.
"It has been suggested by some that
the money it is contemplated to expend
on this exposition could be applied more
profitably to the establishment of a line
of steamers between this port and the
Orient, or in aid of some transcontinental
road or for the beautifying of the city.
The amounts which would be required
from the State and the city for the pur
poses of the exposition would have very
little value in aid of any of the three
above mentioned projects; while it might
very well be that the holding of a great
exposition would so fix San Francisco's
position in the eyes of the world as to re
sult .in the accomplishment of all three
of the aforementioned purposes without
any- State or municipal aid whatever.
'"Capital will come of Its own accord to
the. city that gives the best promise of be
ing a great commercial center.
. "The people of San Francisco believe
that San Francisco is the one such city
on the. Pacific Coast. The main question
is how to impress our belief on the re
mainder of the world. It would seem that
this could be done more efficiently and
more .economically by a great and success
ful object lesson, such as this Pacific
Ocean Exposition could- be made, than by
the expenditure of an equal amount of
money for any other purpose."-
METHODISTS OPPOSED
TO CLASS LEGISLATION
PREPARE SPECIAL RESOLUTION
TO THE LEGISLATURE.
Dwight L. Moody Invited: to Hold' 6.
Series of Revivals in This City. ..
.Miss Bancroft's Appeal.' .
Whereas, there are two bills before the Legis
lature asking that a constitutional amendment
be submitted- to a- vote, .of the .people exempt
ing schools from taxation that are . conducted
not for profit -but' for philanthropy, the one
being general and the other special. . .'â¢''." 'â /'
Resolved. First, that 'while j favoring - the
principle, we enter our most- solemn protest
against the special and class legislation of ex
empting one school to the exclusion of other?,
run' for â  the same purpose, from the privileges
of the contemplated amendment,
"".{"solved. -Secondly, that we do favor the
exemptions of all' such schools, from taxation
and earnestly request the passage of the bill
submitting such exemptions from taxation, as
a constitutional amendment, to a vote of the
people.
The above resolution was introduced by
Rev. J. a. B. -Wilson in the meeting of
the Methodist ministers yesterday and
was unanimously adopted by that body,
it was apropos of an appeal made by Dr.
G. W.. White, president of the Southern
California University, who has been in
Sacramento during the past few days In
the interest of the amendment to the con
stitution introduced by Cobb of San Fran
cisco, exempting schools and colleges from
taxation.
Dr. White, in an address, stated that
the bill had been reported back to both
houses without recommendation by the
Senate and Assembly Judiciary Commit
tees, and that he had used his utmost
endeavors to effect Its passage. He asked
the assistance of the Ministers' Union,
and that organization signified its inten
tion of aiding the well known educator
from the southern portion of the State.
Dr. E. R. Dille, Dr. J. A. B. Wilson and
Dr. Ell McClish of the University of the
Pacific were appointed a committee to go
to Sacramento and present the resolution
and work for the passage of the impor
tant measure.
Miss Henrietta Bancroft, a representa
tive of the Woman's Home Missionary
Society and the deaconesses' work In the
Methodist Episcopal church, was invited
to address the body, and for. fifteen min
utes she gave an interesting account Of
the labors accomplished by her organiza
tion and asked for the co-operation of
the ministers present.
Dr. Dwlght L. Moody, the famous evan
gelist, has been invited to hold a series of
revival meetings under the auspices of

Rev. Drs. Coyle, Beard and Hammond
were appointed a committee to draft a
memorial on the late Dr. F. F. Jewell
D.D., and are given until next Monday to
report. On that day Rev. J. A. B. Wilson
Is scheduled to read a paper on.the "Sins
of the Ministry The paper is expected
to be sensational in its nature, and com
ing from such a well known divine will
certainly bring forth a large attendance.

BUSINESS MEN'S" ASSOCIATION.
Pavement of Valencia Street With
Bitumen Under Consideration.
The nucleus of a business men's associa
tion was partially perfected at a meeting
of the board of directors held last night
at Native Sons* Hall, on Seventeenth
street. The directors, who were elected
at a mass meeting a few evenings since
by the merchants and other business men
of tho Mission district, selected the fol
lowing officers last night: President. L. A.
Sue; first vice-president, H. F. Wynne;
second vice-president, E. McCoy; secre
tary, E. S. Harrison, and treasurer, L. J.
Goldman. The appointment of members
of the association on the various commit
tees was continued until the next meet
ing, as upon the personnel of these com
mittees much of the progress of the im
provment association will depend.
The objects of the association, as
stated by several of those present at the
meeting last night, are the paving of Va
lencia street with bitumen, the repaying
of Sixteenth and other important busi
ness streets in the Mission, and the se
curing of additional lights.
When the bond question comes before
the people provisions will be required
making an allowance for the purchase of
cemetery lots for park purposes. The old
shanties which stand- on the "flat-iron!"
section of West Mission street, the as
sociation says, should be torn down and
the grounds converted Into a park, as the
property by right belongs to the city.
It ls the intention of the promoters of
the association to keep out all small jeal
ousies and work In harmony to further
the improvements of the business portion
of the district. The following new mem
bers joined the association at the meet
ing last night: Fred P. Schuster, 427 Va
lencia: J. D; Heiss, 500 Valencia; Charles

SANTA FE OFFICIALS.
Two More Arrive and a General Con
ference Will Soon Be Held.
C. M.. Higglnson. assistant to President
Ripley of the Santa Fe road, arrived in
town yesterday afternoon with his wife
and took apartments at the Palace.. Mr..
Higglnson is accompanied by his private
secretary, W. C. Daumllng, and is the
third prominent official of the company
who has. arrived here during the last ten
days. .The. other two are George T.
Nicholson-, passenger traffic manager,' and
John Player, superintendent of machin
ery. W. A. Bissell. the new Pacific Coast
manager for the line, is due to reach her.
in a few days and with him will come
Paul .Morton, vice president of the road.
When they arrive a general conference
"will be held and it is expected that af
fairs will shortly commence, to liven up
in railroad circles. .-
All the gentlemen are extremely- reti
cent as to "the real purport of their visit
and will only say that- they are here for
the transaction of business in connec
tion with , the absorption of the Valley
road and for the acquiring of proper
terminal facilities. It is said that when
Vice â¢ President Morton, appears on the
scene something definite will occur.
In the meanwhile the officials are look
ing over the ground here and will thor
oughly familiarize themselves with all the
details of the Santa Fe's new acquisi
tion. As one of them puts it. "Things
will become very warm here in the course
of five months," but whether this applies
to the weather or to railroad affairs has
not been made clear.
FILIPINOS DEPART.
Will Go to Montreal to Join Their
Self-Exiled Associates.
The two Filipinos, General Rlego de
Dlos and M. Rivera, who arrived last
week from Manila intending to join their
associates in Washington, have decided
to go to Montreal, and will leave on this
evening's train for that place. Mr. Ri
vera expresses himself as perfectly as
tounded at the kind treatment he has in
variably received in this city; and deeply
appreciates It. When the news of their
countrymen's outbreak against the Amer
ican soldiers was made known to them
on their arrival they felt a little dubious
as to the result of their visit, but their
fears in that regard have proven ground
less, and they will leave with a deep
sense of the kindness accorded to them.
Last night they entertained a half
dozen friends at an elaborate dinner at

â 7 " '- '. â 
Alcazar Actors in "A Gold Mine."
Juvenile Cakewalkers Score
the Hit at the
Orpheum.
A drop ln the attendance at the Colum
bia last night testified to the familiar
fact that "Julius Caesar" ls the least pop
ular of the popular plays of
Shakespeare. First of all "Caesar"
lacks in the female interests. Its
women are few and subsidiary. It ls
you might say, a stag play which omits
too much that the public love. Leaving
the women out of the case sets a relent
less limit to the passions. Politics, ( war,
man's love and treachery for his fellow
manâ are about all that's left for
the womanless playwrlter to work on.
Even when women were denied . the
joys of playacting female roles
were written and Impersonated. That
she is able to revenge herself in the
present day by gobbling up all the small
boy parts in sight is only an evidence of
the popularity of the sex. "Julius Caesar"
suffers for Its over-mascullnlty. I have
read the play often and have seen it on
the stage as many times as any fellow
of my years, and admire much of It with
(I say it in all modesty) something just
as good as cant admiration of
the classics that Is hammered into us in
our schooldays so that we may spout It
as a virtue in our after lifeâ I have
yet to see a performance of "Julius
Caesar" that fills me with the proper sus
tained excitement. ;.-.:'
The play Is not cumulative ln Its dra
matic effect. It does not grip you and
carry you along in its inevitable fate, as
"Othello" does, as "Macbeth," as "Ham
let." Divide the piece where Caesar dies
and you will have two fairly different
dramas. Cut It oftener and you will get
as many more as you want. I can ad
mire the stabbing scene, the orations of.
Brutus and Antony, the quarrel scene, a
hundred lines that make; famous.quota
tions, and the pictured pomp and stride of
old Rome; but for the life of me I can't
admire the play as a play. And in making
this statement I copiously â¢ use the per
sonal pronoun, not so much because It : is.
a habit of mine to-do so as because/this
is merely an Individual note and not the
chorus of the whole paper. Those who
don't agree can consider "Julius Caesar"
all over again, and then, still not agree
ing, regard this In the light of a confes
sion.
The best individual work in last night's
performance was done by Mr. Warde in
the part of Marc Antony. It would be a
very, hard matter, 1 .should say,, not to
do. well in Antony. What there Is of the
part is all plums.. In trie funeral oration
it' offers one of the best single speeches In
the literature of the drama; arid since
modern ' stage management has . trained
the mob. to supply applause Independent
â¢of the outside audience, failure In this
oration is the last thing the actor has
to worry about. It. becomes simply a
question of how- well he does the "scene.
And with all . respect to ; the late Ned
Buckley, who played such a brilliant An
tony with Booth and Barrett, I think that
Mr. Warde'- is as fine an Antony as this
generation has witnessed.' There is some
thing more in it than firecracker oratory;
there is a touch of satire,, a noble. sCorn
for the swayable passions of the mob.
And the emphasis and the "business" .
that illumine the- reading and give dignity
and deflniteness to the most extravagant
phrases and. the most obvious heroicsâ it
is in the mastery of . such detail as well
as In the breadth of the general concep
tion that Mr. Warde attains to the su
perlative of himself. So* far in the season
this is the first chance' that I have had to
praise Mr. Warde without stint, >so I
cheerfully make the most of It.
Mr. James was the Brutus, a good big
strong Brutus that left nothing undone
and overdid little; and Mr. Collin Kem
per was "dignified and impressive "âabout
all that any actor does ln the part of
Caesar. The rest of the cast did fairly
wellâ not to mention several Interesting
peculiarities ln the mobâ the unex
pected exception of Barry Johnstone,
whose work, usually so sure and easy,
was very much to the bad in an over
wrought Cassius. ;';*-.

California.
A year has" gone by since the Black
Patti and her tuneful companions, and
the witty and versatile Ernest Hogan, the
prince of black comedians, gave , San
Francisco a taste of their quality, but
they were remembered as kindly and wel
comed as warmly last night as though
they had not been gone a week.
Patti has not changed since her last
appearance. She has the same cheerful
voice and the same atrocious style of
singing, the first making the hearer glad,
the second sad.
': The show ls brimful of fun, broadening
into farce, but it is all good natured and
mirth provoking. There are three pretty
girls in the lot, so white of skin as to ex
cite surprise. â¢ â¢ â â¢'.". : Â»
Hogan, the inimitable, Is at. his best.
His new : song, "If They Only Fought
With Razors in -the War," captured the
house. '.'Ann Eliza, My Rag Time Girl,"
by Judson Hicks and Mattie Phillips, was
sung and danced with spirit. . The buck
dancing' by the girls of trie, company was
a much applauded feature of the- enter
tainment.
The best serious number of '-the-, even
ing .was "The Armorer's Song,", from
Robin Hood, by ; James Lightfoot. ' The
sextette- from "Lucia dl Lammermoor,"
sung by- Black . Patti, George Holt and
the chorus was deservedly encored.
Tivoli.
The Tivoli scored another genuine suc
cess last night. ? : "Madeleine,-.' or the Magic
Kiss," Is one of the. brightest and most I
catchy comic operas that; has been seen!
here in many .moons; and should prove a
drawing card for weeks to come. The
large audience accepted the play from
the first number, and recalls were so fre- j
quent that It was nearly midnight before; I
the curtain was rung .down for the last
time.. -- * â  . â¢â¢; ' . -.'-.:?' '-. . ' *:?:'.' y
â¢ The story of "Madeleine, or the Magic
'Kiss," is ..based on a legend concerning the
. house of De Grimm, which prophesies
that. any Baron of that line who remains
a 'bachelor-- arid reaches, the â¢ age of 100
years, may, on â¢ attaining his; hundredth
â  birthday, have seventy-five years taken
off his age, providing he -is kissed before
noon of that day by .a maiden who has at-
tained her majority without- ever having
been kissed by man or boy. , .â â¢.â¢. y i ..-
The Baron -de Grimm - has remained a
bachelor and has raised his ward Made
leine under a solemn promise to give her
maiden kiss to -him on his hundredth
birthday. Many amusing â¢ complications
grow 'out of .this state of "affairs. , More
fun is* added' by the power which is given
the Baron to bestow some of his physical
attributes upon his friends when he re-
gains his twenty-fifth birthday.' Upon his
physician, Dr.* Gourmet, . he bestows his
phenomenal appetite. . : â -.---..â  Â-."â¢: :â¢
.The chase of Matrimonial Mary, a sex
tet widow, ; after a seventh husband, the
trials of M&rgot and Vivette, Gourmet 1 3 |
daughters, and Francois,, the steward, :
and Jules Le Meagre, the scribe, all help
to round out the clever work. ; .
The honors of last night's performance
belong to Miss Annie Myers, for her sing-
Ing and acting of the part of Matrimonial
Mary\ The clever bi-play between. her and.
Dr. Gourmet (Edwin Stevens) brought
down the house on several occasions.
Miss Anna Lichter was admirably cast
as Madeleine, and her â¢slngir" in the en
semble of the second act was so thrilling
that the audience would not be denied,
and the number had to be repeated.
Phil Branson as the Baron de Grimm,
Arthur Boyce as Francois, the steward;
William Pruette as Auguste Deutcri. alias
Frederi Ribeau, and Miss Ida Wyatt and
Miss Bernice Holmes as Gourmet's daugh
ters were. well cast arid did exceptionally
well. Add to these facts the perfection
of the staging and the splendid work of
the orchestra, and it is no wonder there
were so many recalls last night. â 
... . Alcazar*. '..'. i.
"A Gold Mine" was ' presented .by tha
Alcazar Theater stock company last even
ing to a fair sized audience, It is a three
act comedy, in which Nat: C. Goodwin fig
ured as the chief attraction and with suc
cess. The story is laid in London, where
a Grass Valley (Cal.) gold mine owner is
trying to sell his property. He falls in
love with Sir Everard Foxwpod's Widowed
sister and sells the mine for a trifle in
order to get Sir Everard's son out of
trouble. The lady manages to get hold
of the mine, which she restores, with her
self added, to the American. Ernest
Hastings takes the part of the mine
owner, Georre Osbourne that of Sir Ev
erard and Adelaide Fitzallen represents
the Hon. Mrs. Meredith, tho Baronet's
sister. 'â¢ .
Orpheum. '.
The most successful of the new turns at
the Orpheum this week is furnished by
Carter de Haven and Bonnie Male, Juve
nile vaudevilliar.s. They call their act
"A Naval Reserve," and it is quite dull
and amateurish in arrangement until to
ward the close, when the young per
formers sing a "rag" and do a cakewalk.
This cakewalk is the hit of the turn. In
fact, it is the hit of the entire new billâ
I full of graceful poise and the real fancy
nigger movement. P. C. Shortis, a vete
ran banjo player, does some lively work
on that now almost extinct instrument,
the fretless banjo, besides giving popular
imitation^ on the violin. It is only justice
to Mr. Shortis to say that his banjo ren
dition of "The Georgia Camp Meeting" is
quite drowned in the noisy orchestral ac
companiment. Pie sounds to much better
advantage when accompanied only by the
piano. The other new turns are hardly
up to the mark. The Nobles' new sketch,
"Bilgeville Junction," is not nearly so
clever as "Why Walker Reformed." Con
roy and McDonald do a lamentably old
fashioned Irish act, and Long and Keeler
are no nearer the spirit of the present in
a turn whose principal characters are a
Corbettllke dude and a sentimental tramp.
Professor Macart's cultivated dogs and
monkeys continue in popular favor.
Chutes.
â¢ Ida Howell, a surprising serio-comic,
with a lot of new songs that have not
been heard here before, made a big hit
at. the Chutes Free theater last, evening;
Querita Vincent, the "Zizzi-ze Zumster,"
continued, her amazing, revolutions, and
Carlos and Voulettl and the three De
Bolien brothers varied their gymnastic
balancing and acrobatic work. Pianka,
the lion lady, continues to thrill, and
"The.Passlon Play" is becoming, more of
a feature every perform*. .- An ama

Carreno's Recital.
Another delightfully balanced pro
gramme beautifully, played marked Mme.
Carreno's second recital, which was given
in the Metropolitan Temple last night to
a fairly numerous audience. She per
formed the [ Bach-Liszt Fantasle and
Fugue, in G minor, the first Beethoven so
nata of the 27th opus., a group of Chopins,
another of Rubinsteins and the Schubert-
Tausie. Marche Milltaire. Also she played
the MacDovvell Etude de Concert, a wel
come tribute to the American composer,
Who so seldom gets a hearing in his own
country. The recital w.ls an enthusiastic
success. Carreno was in splendid mettle
and displayed all of those remarkable
qualities of temperament, analysis, tone
color and technique that were discussed
in an earlier issue. Three times was she
compelled to reappear before the audience
at the. close of the concert.
Carreno gives her positively farewell re

ANGLERS WERE FOOLED,
False Reports From Russian River
Caught a Number of Gullibles.
The recent report from the Russian
River that good steelhead fishing awaited
the anglers of this city has proven to tie
a very false rumor. However, a number
of enthusiastic anglers rushed to Duncans
Mills last Saturday and Sunday anticipat
ing royal sport and also the pleasure of
surprising their friends with "fresh run
fishes" on their return home. But the
gullibles who, ravenously bit at the false
reports. that were dispatched last week
from Russian River returned; of course,
sadder and wiser men.
Of the fifteen trollers who fished dili
gently on Saturday and Sunday, not a
single man hooked a fish or saw a scale;
in fact, there was not a fish to be caught,
as the large steelheads ascended the
stream during the freshet of a few weeks
ago, leaving only a few, straggling young-,
sters of three or four pounds â - in weight,
which are now working up the river In
quest of the eggs of the larger fishes,. A
few spent fishes were taken last week by
Messrs. Cross and Wilson, and their cap
ture gave rise to the report that a Iresh
run of steelheads. was on the way.
The outlook for steelhead? fishing on
Russian River this season is, indeed, very
poor. Still, if there should be among the
angling fraternity any. member who is de
sirous of an outing, the trip to Duncans
Mills is assuredly pleasant because of the
many changes of beautiful scenery en
route. The boating on the river is Very
enjoyable, allowing that a pleasure seeker
Is provided with his own boat, otherwise
he must pay handsomely for a hired craft.

SAN JOSE. Feb. 13.-The levying of
an cessment of $10 per .hare by- the
oirectors of the defunct; Unions Savings
Bank has allayed the fear of depositors
trial they would save but a few cents
on the dollar from the financial wreck
â Th's was especially discernible among
those in ; attendance at the depositors*
meeting at Hale's Hall, this morning.
There were not the worry and excite
ment that has characterized all their
other meetings and the desire was ex-"
pressed to wait and see what the di
rectors would do? /'"
There has been a split among the de
positors and two sets of them have or
ganized. All the young attorneys who
have had claims assigned to them have
joined a combination headed by C M
Hatcher. , : .-:â¢'-; â *.:- -.â¢â¢'.
A policeman was stationed at the door
and only those with pass-books were
admitted. About 300 depositors were
present.
-s The meeting was called to order by
c w. iy- 11 ? 55 * The finance; committee
reported it had engaged Attorney T. R
Welch to look after the members'
claims. This action was ratified. Chair
man F. W. ..Potter of the finance com
mittee resigned. A.. L. Chrisman was
elected in his place and H.T.Besse and
B. D. Owsley were added to the com
mittee.
Potter reported an interview he had
with Nicholas Bowden, a director of
and attorney for the bank. Bowden
said his duties were to pass upon se
curities offered the bank. Otherwise
he knew little about the bank's busi
ness. He assured Potter the depositors
. would lose nothing. The assessment of
$10 levied Saturday was only the first
of a series of seven that would be
levied if necessary to pay all indebted
ness. The director said Howards in- !
debtedness was slightly over $300,000, i
with but little security. Bowden had ;
been elected a director against his will 1
and was sick in bed at the time. Pot
ter said another director had assured
him depositors would be paid in full.
.:.: No action will be taken by the deposi
tors immediately and they are inclined !
to wait until after the stockholders'

POSTUM CEREAL.
"STRONG MAN IRVING."
Agrees With Other Athletes on
Points in Diet.
Montgomery E. Irving, who is said to
be one of the strongest men in the
world, in a recent interview with the
Baltimore (Md.) News, said, In regard
to diet: "Keep away from coffee. It
should be taken off the market."
Whenever one talks with athletes
nowadays he finds the same expression
in regard to coffee. It .weakens the
heart, shortens the wind, and unless
one is very strong in the digestive ap-
paratus interferes seriously with that
portion of the body. .
If it is necessary for a strong man to
avoid narcotics and drugs of this char-
acter, it would seem especially impor-
tant for the brain worker or the highly
sentltized and delicately organized
woman to avoid them as they would
any other poison, if they feel the slight-
est desire to maintain their health and
a comfortable poise .of the nervous sys-
tem. â¢; .'-.-â¢. : ?' ; â¢ â â ;â  - : .'?
True, many people seem to use cof-
fee without a direct harmful effect, but'
a little careful inquiry will nearly al-
ways develop the fact that coffee users,
have some disturbance of the body,
which they always attribute. to some
other cause than coffee, but which, by
a curious law, is likely to. be helped if?
they dm ever be Induced to abandon
coffee for ten days to a month, and
take on Postum Cereal . Food Coffee,
which, instead of narcotizing- and de-
stroying the nervous system, furnishes
the food elements demanded by nature
to rebuild the gray matter in : the nerve
centers throughout the body. .
Postum is widely endorsed b- athletic
trainers, famous bicycle riders and box-
ers, as well as thousands of well-known
men and women who' earn their living

CONGRESS TO ACT ON

is declared inevitable. /Nearly all the

THE MILES
in. : Their testimony is overwhelming
ly against the beef. It contradicts Ea
gan and Alger. It does more than this:
It gives the He point blank to the white
washing report by Alger's Investigating
Committee, just published.
7. These solemn statements from 264 of
ficers, who with their troops were at
the front, and saw and tried to eat the
decayed and poisoned beef, have made
a deep impression upon the lawmaking
branch of the Government.
7-7'lt is because ; of the overwhelming
character of this testimony, now near
completion, that Congress will appoint
a committee to make a thorough inves
tigation of all the facts involved in the
beef scandal. Such committee can hold
its session, during the interval between
March 4 and the session next autumn.
The committee will have supreme pow

can summon whole regiments of sol

Hawaii Needs Exclusion
'- Laws. . l
BILL IS REPORTED BACK
IMPORTANT AMENDMENTS TO
THE SENATE MEASURE.
It Is Realized That Steps Must Be
Taken to Check the Contract-
Labor System on the
Islands.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13.â Senator
Fairbanks, from the Senate Committee
on Immigration, to-day reported back
to the Senate the bill extending the
anti-contract labor laws of the United
States to Hawaii with amendments
making the bill cover all immigration
questions. i'yy â 
The amendments specifically include
the Chinese exclusion acts. The bill
was accompanied by a written report ]
in which the committee says:
The committee is of the opinion that
since the Hawaiian Islands have come
within the jurisdiction and authority of
the United States, our immigration laws
should be so extended as to protect the
citizens and laborers In those islands from
invasion by Immigration of undesirable
subjects or citizens of other countries.
Under the municipal legislation of the Ha
waiian Islands, the importation of con
tract laborers is expressly sanctioned.
This class of immigration forms by far
the larger portion of the objectionable ele
ments now being imported into the islands
and is entirely repugnant to the policy of
the United States. -
Since. the passage of the joint resolution
of annexation, there has been a decided
Impetus given to the importation of con
tract laborers into the islands by the su
gar plantation owners. The committee is
Informed that each vessel from Asiatic
countries ls increasing the list of contract
laborers, and unless some restrictive
measures are adopted the number must
shortly be still further augmented. ;.-â ;
The joint resolution annexing the isl
ands to the United States provided for
the exclusion of Chinese in the following
language: "There shall be no further im
migration of Chinese into the Hawaiian
l-'ands except upon such conditions as
are now or may hereafter be allowed by
the laws of the United States.". --yy -;â¢' =
This provision the committee regards as
inadequate, Inasmuch as it. does not pro
vide for apprehending and deporting Chi
nese immigrants should they land in con
travention of the terms of the joint reso
lution above Quoted. It Is therefore
deemed essential that the provisions of
the Chinese exclusion acts as well as the
discriminating immigration laws of the
United States should be promptly, ex
tended for the protection and welfare of
the citizens of Hawaii. . .. :

ALGER SAYS HE DID
THE BEST HE COULD
?â  XEW YORK. Feb. 13.â Secretary ,of
War â¢ Alger, who is here to attend the
Lincoln day dinner of the Union
League: Club in Brooklyn, said ; to-day, 1
In regard to the report of the War Com
mission, that he would rather not say
anything about It until he had read
the entire report.. Genera) Alger, how
ever, said he had carried on the work
all the way through the war to the
best of his ability.
"During the war," said the Secretary,
"when we had so much to do, criticisms:
began to appear in some papers. When
COURT OF
this happened I gave orders; that those
â  papers should not be sent to me, as
there was nO time to waste. My first
duty was to conduct the affairs of the
department as well as I could.*'
General Alger compared the depart
i ment with a large private business, ?
saying that many unforeseen things;
happened in the department just as in ;
a large private business. Storms came
up which could not be prevented.
7 "Sometimes the manager of a private
business." said the Secretary, "has
looked over the field and believes he
has good and faithful helpers. Then he
learns that he has been Incorrect in his
thought and that some of his men have
not proved true. These are generally
unforeseen things which will happen in
many large business concerns as well
as to a Government department. ;
Though the work of the War Depart
ment was difficult, I carried it on, as
operetta the acting was good, and, in i
fact, far above the ordinary. Those who ;
essayed the -various roles seemed to have !
divested themselves of the awkwardness
usually characteristic of the amateur.
They carried their parts; as professional?.
and received undiminished praise and en
couragement for their efforts from those
who constituted their audience. The cast
was as follows:
Pitcher. J. C. O'Donnell; Tosser, F. A.
Griffing; Chalks, D. C Sheerin; Mrs.
Croaker, Miss G. Sullivan; Penelope, Miss
Etta M. Welch.
The various numbers on the programme
were rendered by the following local: tal
ent: Misses Hattie Edwards. Phoebe De
mara, Etta and Lillian Coleman, Joseph
ine and Emily Paradl. Miss Anna Roney

ada, and a son. Dr. E. H. Woodruff of

ter's staff In early days. It- was -he who
permitted his name to be used as plain
tiff in the suit against the North Bloom
field Mining Company, a test case and the
first to determine the legality of mining

such sales were being made. . Some per
sons were, selling supplies at less than

Colonel Bliss found that two men were
buying up all the supply rations from
the troops. , The rations the troops se
cured were more than they could wish,
and it is considered legitimate to sell
them again. It is a general practice in
the army for companies to sell their

Expulsion Proceedings to Be Taken
'Against the Company Now

NEW YORK, Feb. 13.-A Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long has referred to the Attorney Gen
eral for expulsion proceedings upon the
refusal of the corporation, owning Mis?
sion Rock, San Francisco, to : surrender it
to the Government.
It will .be recalled that the President
recently issued a proclamation placing
Mission Rock under the. navy for use as -
a coaling station. Immediately upon the
issuance of the proclamation the com
mandant of the Mare Island navy, yard.
In accordance with, instructions* given â 
him, wrote to the company occupying the '
rock demanding its surrender? which
was refused. That company wants to
sell its title and property to the Govern
ment for $250,000, but an examination of
the records of the land office showed that 'â 
its title was defective by reason of the
fact that the State has no control over
territory beyond tide water, such prop
erty belonging to the United States. i
Commander R. B. Bradford, chief of the |
bureau of equipment, is making plans toy
establishing a coal station on Mission

STOCKTON, Feb. 13, â Word was!
brought here to-day of -the arrest yester- v
day, some distance south of Milton, in I
Calaveras County, of the two men who i
made a futile attempt to hold up the {
Jackson-lone stage last Tuesday, when j.
Driver Fodesto and Messenger McCDnnetl.j
were wounded. yy .:' j
Little . could "be learned regarding the j
arrest, as the news reached here late, but
it is known that Sheriff Gregory is con- 1
vinced that the two men he has in jail at J.
Jackson are hot the right ones? while the '
two arrested yesterday by Sheriff Thorn |
had a day or two before sold a rifle and i
shotgun to a farmer .; and sheep-raiser!
named Shroebel, living north of 7 Milton: j
The two guns were disposed of for 33. and l
the willingness ' of the men to part with I
them for so small, a sum dire sus- j
picion in their direction. It is known that
both the shotgun and rifle were used in j
the hold-up, as the charge which struck ,
McConnell came from a shotgun and a !
50-90 Winchester rifle shell was found near !
where the .robbers hid. The shell had been j
snapped, but not exploded. A Shotgun
cartridge was also found in the deserted .
camp of the robbers. â â -.-.,.- . ' j

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
SUPERVISORS
ARE OPPOSED
TO DEPUTIES
Declare Them to Be
% Unnecessary.
SLAP AT OFFICE SEEKERS
NEARLY ALL WERE ANXIOUS
FOB RE-ELECTION.
Said to Be ; Unbusinesslike to Ask
./7Ty': or Extra Help as Soon as
, They Succeed Them
selves.
OAKLAND. Feb. 13.â "N0 more help If
we can prevent it," declare? the Super
visors of Alameda County, in regard to
the officials seeking additional deputies
through the medium of the Legislature.
This morning the Supervisors were In
session when Mr. Wells, the Democratic
member of the board, introduced a reso
lution which contained a strong element
of sarcasm. . The resolution ie as follows :
Whereas, the legislative delegation from Ala
meda County has -greed upon a bill allowing
certain county officials extra deputies; there
fore, be it -V â  â¢"â â â :.
Resolved, That the Board of Supervisors of
Alameda County, at: a regular meeting held
on February 18, 1899, is opposed to said bill
Increasing the number of deputies for the coun
ty of Alameda; It is further .-â â '.'
Resolved, That we do not deem It advisable
or business like at this time to add a yearly '
Increase of expenditures for extra deputies li
the sum of about $15,000; be It further
Resolved, That as nearly all the county :
officials were more than anxious to serve the !
said county of Alameda for another . term
under the present law. which was verified by I
the eagerness with which said offices . were
fought at the last election, we therefore fail
to see any good reason for this sudden in
crease of deputies and expenditure of public
money: be It further
v Resolved, That the clerk of this board be
directed. to mall a copy of these resolutions;
to each legislative representative from this
county. ' . .:â â¢ â¢ , .
There was very little discussion over
the resolution. Mr. Church suggested as
an amendment that one deputy be allowed
the Treasurer's office, as this is aVieces
;^ty. and Mr. Wells accepted the amend
ment. With this little discussion the reso
lution was passed.
'â ':' Many of the officials declare that the
act on of the Supervisors is uncalled for.
â¢js.it is well known that many of the de
partments are not properly provided for
under the new county government act.
The resolutions were forwarded this even
ing to Sacramento In time to be laid be
fore the Alameda legislators at their cau
cus^this evening. Now that it appears
probable that an entirely new law relative
to registration of voters will be passed at
this session of tne Legislature, consider
able relief is felt in the County Clerk's
office.:; _ â  â¢â -..â .
MARCH WILL NOT

Almost, on the eve of his release from
Ban Quentin, . where he has served a
year's sentence for burglary committed
In this city. William F. March was made
defendant in proceedings for a divorce
Instituted to-day by his wife, Hester
Carpenter March. . Mrs. March bases
her right for legal separation on the
ground that her husband has been con
victed of a felony. The complaint was
filed late this afternoon by her attorney,
George E. Jackson. March, who is also'
known by the name of William Marsh.wlll
have completed his sentence this month.
The plaintiff was a popular young woman
when she married March, who attributes
his downfall to bad associates.
The divorce suit of Frank E. Periera
against Mary Soito Periera of Havwards
came up before Judge Ellsworth to-day.
The defendant's case is a sad one, she
being deserted by her husband a month
after the nuptials had been celebrated.
The plaintiff had decamped for Honolulu
at the time, leaving her to seek the home
of her aged father for succor and protec
tion.
Once within the period of desertion
Periera wrote to his wife that he intend
ed going to other Islands to secure work
Tout instead he returned to Haywards and
â was received without welcome. ; Pretty
Mary Soito's love for him had grown
cold and she refused to kindle anew the
fire of her affections. The jilted husband
Immediately sued for a divorce, alleging
desertion.
On the witness stand to-day Mrs. Pe
riera testified that aside from the support
afforded her by her father she had no
other income except what she realized
from fruit picking.
Judge Ellsworth fixed the alimony at
$15 per month during the pendency of the
puit, also $10 car fare for her witnesses
and $40 for counsel fees. These amounts
will have to be paid by Periera before he
can secure the decree he sues for.
Mary A. Case to-day brought suit for
a divorce from James R. Case, alleging
statutory grounds.
The divorce suit of Eliza Burkart
against Anton Burkart was to-day re
ferred to Court Commissioner Babcock to
take testimony. Default of defendant was
also entered. â  ' ;-.â â¢â '
THAT DELGER NOTE.
James J. Lamping Still Has Faith in
Its Validity.
â¢ OAKLAND, Feb. 13.â The demurrer of
. James- J. Lamping to the. complaint in
the suit of E. . F. Delger and Matilda
Brown, as executors of the estate of the
late Frederick Delger,. brought for the
purpose" of calceling a $10,000 note, on the
ground that the same, If signed by Delger
at all was signed by mistake, was argued
before Judge Ellsworth to-day.
W. R. Davis, for the defendant, con
tended that the complaint did not specify,
wherein the allegation of fraud or mis
take consisted, and that therefore the
facts alleged are not sufficient to con
stitute a cause of action. .
Judge Ellsworth Intimated that tbe de
murrer would be sustained, but allowed
Congressman' Victor H. Metcalf, attor
ney for the plaintiffs,. until next Monday
to cite authorities supporting his conten
tions that the complaint is sound and the
suit properly brought in a court of equity.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
y/i--.y7- 908 Broadway, Feb. 18. /
Suit was .filed /this afternoon by Charles
W. Hunt and his wife, Margaret G. Hunt,
against Dr. Walter F. Lewis, the well-to
do dentist, residing on El Dorado avenue,
at Linda Vista terrace, for the recovery
Of $10,000 damages sustained by reason of
the alleged gross carelessness of extract
ing a tooth. .yyy.y
According to the complaint prepared by
Attorneys M. C. Chapman and Fred C.
Cllft, plaintiffs last February* engaged the
professional services of : the defendant
doctor of dental surgery to extract a largo
defective tooth from the upper jaw of
I Mrs. Hunt and to treat professionally any
| inflammation that might result.
The troublesome tooth was extracted,
and it became necessarj" next to insert a
small rubber tube v into the cavity to .'al-?
! low .any pus that might . gather to be
! drained. This rubber tube? the complaint
i charges, was inserted so far that the in-
I flammation which followed inclosed the
\ same, with disastrous results, all of j
which; was performed with gross careless- j
ness and failed not only to cure Mrs. j
Hunt's toothache but caused her to suf
fer excruciating pain by reason of a ten
der and sore head and face.
7 Mrs. Hunt, moreover, alleges that de
fendant afterward abandoned all attempts
to locate or remove the pain-inflicting
rubber tube, whereby she sustained last
ing and permanent injuries.
The parties are prominent In their re
spective vocations, and a great deal of
interest centers around the probable out
come. Mr. Hunt is of the firm of Hunt,
Hatch & Co., commission merchants, and
is also well-to-do. . - . ' .-.

tified that he and John Flynn had gone
to the saloon on the night of the rob
bery. He "had $112 with him at the time,
and after shaking for drinks Needham
and Conway persuaded him to indulge ma
a poker game. He charged that Needham
pulled cards from a cold deck beneath

Martha P. Jacobs against Dr. D. D.
Crowley for the recovery of money for the
j support of Pauline E. Crowley, a minor,
defendant won before Judge Ellsworth to
day, his demurrer to the complaint being
sustained. Plaintiff, who was formerly
Mrs. Crowley, asked for $75 monthly for
the support of the girl at a convent, j
whereas Dr. Crowley has always Insisted ;
that his daughter be educated in the pub- ;
lie schools. It was shown that the father j
had contributed $25 monthly for the girl's !
support, and through his attorney, F. W. \
Fry, he objected to paying the excessive
rates demanded by plaintiff. He stated i
that he had no objection to caring for the
daughter, but drew the line at the sup- |
port of his ex-wife and the present step- j
father of his daughter. o:

HAS ALREADY

Sections.
ALL FIXED FOR THE COUNCIL
PECULIAR ATTITUDE OP THE
PRESENT MEMBERS.
Some Damaging Pacts Which Will Be
Forthcoming in the Promised
Inquiry Into : thÂ©
â¢..Matter. _-â¢'
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway? Feb. 13.-
It is a noteworthy fact that at the in
vestigation prior to fixing water rates
the members of the committee asked no
question at all of the water company's
representatives, while the six Councilmen
who were not on the committee, but who
were present by courtesy, were the ones
who wanted information. It is also pecu
liar that the present committee should
consist of four members of the "solid six"
and only one member who is opposed to
high rates. Last year this was reversed,
and the investigation was carried on by
men not favorable to the water company's
demands.
It Is said that the ordinance desired by
the water companies is already prepared
and will be introduced at the proper time,
no matter what report the committee may
make. This ordinance has been carefully
made up and apparently decreases rates
In certain instances, but on the whole in
creases the income of the water company
even beyond the figures of the ordinance
now in effect. In the cases of very small
houses, of which. there are hardly any in
this city, the rate Is reduced, but on the
class of houses of which there are most
there is a slight increase.
Manager Watklnson of the Contra Cos
ta Company hurt his cause by his impet
uous and unreasonable answers to some
of the gentlemanly queries of Mr. Upton
and Mr. Rowe. These two gentlemen ap
parent] y wanted the information they
i asked for, while Mr. Watklnson did not
appear anxious to oblige them. Especial
ly was this the case in a discussion .that
took place over the use of water meters.
It is well â¢ known that last June the
Church of the Advent declined to pay its
excessive water bill, based on the sched
ule, amounting to over $3. After an alter
cation with the company the church de
cided to put in a meter and the water
company told them that they would re
gret such action when they saw the re
sult. At the end of the month it was
found that the church had used just 60
cents worth of water and had to pay a
bill of $1, because such Is the . lowest
amount collectable under the ordinance
for meter rates. This fact will be used
; during the investigation.
DEFORMED CHILDREN
DEMANDING ATTENTION
TWO UNHAPPY CASES IN THE
>y- PUBLIC EYE. ?-.-'
Clergymen Take an Interest and a
Benevolent Society Will Try .-â¢"â 
to Lend Assistance.
Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call,
y-y? 908 Broadway, Feb. 13. y
Two unhappy deformed children are oc
cupying the attention of the society which
undertakes to look after such cases. One
of them is. a little deformed girl in West
Oakland, the other is a deformed girl at
the Home of Love for Children. -
In his sermon last evening Rev. J. W.
j Phillips used the following strong lan
; guage: "There is a child in West Oak
! land to-night who is deformed and will be
! for _, life unless a certain necessary sur
j gical operation Is performed. The Infant
, has no doctor's skill to save her, because
a so-called Christian Scientist says there
:is nothing the matter. I know of another
case here in which Christian Scientists
tried to persuade an invalid that there
i was nothing the matter with her, and
; when they found they could; not effect a
! cure they abused her for lack of faith." â¢
o At the close of his lecture Mr. Phillips
I publicly challenged any Christian Scien
tist to cure any case of organic disease
to the satisfaction of himself and- three
reputable physicians. /'â /
At the Home of Love on Twentieth
street is a very remarkable case of de
formity which is interesting -Dr. Herrick.
It is that of a girl about 14 years old who
cannot use her limbs and cannot articu
late, but who seems to possess some de
gree of common-sense. This girl was in
a children's hospital In. San Francisco and
was declared to be a fit subject for the
j Home for Feeble. Minded at Glen Ellen.
After being at the home for a few weeks
the poor girl was declared to be a fit sub
ject for a hospital, and was returned to
the Children's Hospital in "San Francisco.
In turn she was again sent away as not
being a fit subject, and her mother, who
Is a widow and must work- for a living?
took her child to many Institutions, but
none would take her in. -
The Children's Society is attempting to
find some place where the girl can be
cared for, as it is believed r that with
proper treatment she might be developed

ALAMEDA, Feb. .13.â Reuben Smith

fallen into the hands of the Alameda po

volver and a lot of lady's jewelry were
found. ; .
This morning Officer Anderson â ran
across a young fellow trying to dispose
of a $60 diamond ring at a local jeweler's
for $5, and arrested him on suspicion. He 1
gave the name of Roper, but finally broke
down and confessed that he was a com
panion of Smith, and that they . had run
away from home, first taking all the jew
elry they could gather up. He was fined
$10 for disturbing the peace, which his
father paid this afternoon. Smith was

BERKELEY? Feb. 13.â A sensation was

That official introduced a lengthy report

claimed is being used by the residents of

length on the unsanitary condition of the
watershed used, by the Alameda Water
Company, claiming that In many places
It was nothing but the drainage for cess

EXPLANATION BY .J. D. CARR.
Denies That He Urged the Removal
of Mr. Shields and the Appoint-.
. ? y ment of Ed Smith.
? In explanation of his reported attitude
on the appointment of a secretary for the
State Board of Agriculture J. D. Carr has
the following to say: "*;â 
I called upon the Governor and In my
Interview with - him I recommended two
persons to fill the vacancies caused by
the death of Hon. John . Boggs and
Charles M. Chase. Not one word passed
between the Governor and myself as to
the places of the three members who re
tire this year and not one word as to the
secretaryship. I admit frankly that I am
a friend of Mr. Ed Smith, but not to the
extent of recommending him to the Gov
ernor for the purpose of removing Mr.
Shields. I know nothing of Mr. Shields
but what is favorable. I hear that he is
a gentleman of considerable ability. I do
not believe, however, that there is a man.
In the State who can take the offlce of
secretary and fill it as Mr. Smith filled
it under one year's experience. I was on
that board eight years during Mr. Smith's
Incumbency, and I consider him one of
the most competent men for a place of
that kind I ever knew. In fact, I think
but few 'â â  men are as well qualified for
the places they hold as Ed Smith for the
secretaryship of that board. I was very
sorry for his removal, but It is done, and
if he is to be reinstated that will lie en
tirely with â¢ the members of the board.
As to my recommending any one to fill
Mr. Mackay's or any one else's place,
now living, that is also a mistake. Of the
two gentlemen I recommended, one is
from San : Francisco and I thought would
be a proper man to fill Mr. Chase's place;
the other Is from my own county, Mon
terey. I know he is a competent man for
the place and would perform the duties
faithfully if appointed. I believe this part
of the State has had representation on
the board since I resigned five or six
years ago. I never asked either of those
gentlemen if he would support Mr.
Smith for the secretaryship if appointed,
and,* in fact, the subject was not men
tioned'between us in any way.
I think the Governor will bear me out
in saying that not a word was said about
the secretaryship in my interview with
him, and. that I made but two recommen
dations and those were to fill the vacan
cies caused by death.
DEELEY'S READY CLUB.
Brutally Assaults a ; Patient in the
Receiving Hospital.
Policeman Larry Deeley "distinguished"
himself last evening by assaulting a pa
tient, in the Receiving Hospital while the
latter was on the operating table.
Shortly after 5 o'clock Officer Harry
O'Day found a drunken man lying on the
sidewalk at? Mission and Beale streets.
On the way to the City Prison the intox
icated individual attempted to assault
the officer, and finding that he could not
handle him O'Day called .Deeley, who was
patrolling his beat on Market street. See
ing O'Day struggling with his prisoner
Deeley took out his club and brought it
down on the drunken man's head, inflict
ing an ugly scalp wound. His victim was
then taken to the Receiving Hospital and
as he lay on the operating table hand
cuffed and held down by five men Deeley
struck him with his clenched .fist in the
face, and again taking out his' club . pro
ceeded to "heat his head off," as he ex
citedly expressed it. Just as he raided the
locust preparatory to striking his help
less victim Police Surgeon Weil, who Was
stitching the cut in the unfortunate man's
head, grabbed the arm. of the infuriated
officer, thus preventing him from further
injuring the helpless patient. He then or
dered Deeley out of the hospital, after
threatening to call his seemingly brutal
conduct to the' attention of the Police
Commisisoners. y â¢
O'Day subseqeuently took his prisoner
to the City Prison, where he was booked
for drunkenness and battery. He gave
his name as John Gleeson and his occu
pation as that of a laborer. ;

TURNED DOWN
BY THE MAN
FROM MEXICO
San Mateoans After
Burns' Scalp. j
THREW THEM DOWN ii HARD
HAD A SALOON-KEEPER AP
POINTED POSTMASTER.
W. C. Parsons Did Not Get the Place
â¢v Because He Would Not Assist ?
Burns to (iet Assembly
*?^?'''-:man Brown's Vote. y
In his ravenous desire to secure votes
and. crush ;; those who refuse ,to assist
him, ''Mexican". Dan Burns by petty in
terference ln the appointment of a Post
- master of San Mateo has stirred up a
hornets' nest that threatens to disrupt
the entire organization of the Repub
lican party in San Mateo County.' Old
line Republicans of. the county are now
up In arms against Burns, the members
of. the County Committee have kicked
the traces and even residents of the
county who scarcely ever interfere or
take any interest in political affairs are
denouncing Burns as a scoundrel of the
deepest dye.
Because the members of the County
Committee of San Mateo County* re-
fused to advise Assemblyman Brown to
vote for Burns, -the Mexican in a spirit
of vengeance eked out his petty spite
by using his influence to turn down W.
C. Parsons, whom the County Commit
tee recommended for the appointment
of Postmaster of San Mateo. To add in
sult to injury, the "Man from Mexico"
secured the appointment for Thomas E.
Byrnes, a saloon-keeper, -and son of ex-
Senator "Jim" Byrnes, whose career in
the Legislature was regarded as any
thing but 'â '-.. commendable, and whose
reputation : was that of a programmer
willing to stand for any proposition
when the man behind the screen pulled
the string, y/y-.
. W. (...Parsons, the logical though un
fortunate candidate for the position of
Postmaster,. has been a resident of the
county for the past twenty years, and
his reputation throughout the county is
above reproach.
Shortly. after the last election Par
sons, who had worked faithfully for
the success of the entire Republican
ticket, announced himself as a candi
date for the postmastership. His many
warm friends flocked to his support,
and every single member of the County
Committee gave him his recommenda
tion. In addition to this Mr. Parsons'
friends circulated a petition in his be
half, which was signed by nearly every
resident of San Mateo. â¢
This petition was forwarded to Con
gressman Loud, who had promised J.
T. Jennings, chairman of the County
Committee, to indorse anybody whom
the committee saw fit to recommend.
In the meantime Mr. Parsons came to
this city at the suggestion of his friends
to secure whatever influence that could
be exerted In his behalf. Political
manipulators, close up in - the confi
dences of Dan Burns, went to Mr. Par
sons and told him that he could not get
the appointment unless he could induce
the County Committee of his county to
advise Assemblyman Brown to vote for
Burns. Mr. Parsons spurned this prop
osition. He was a man of honor and
principle and he would not, even to
further his own ends, stoop so low as
to bend an effort to aid rascal Dan in
his disgusting attempt to go to the Sen
ate as a representative of California.
So Parsons went back to his home in
San Mateo, thoroughly disheartened
and disgusted by the "pettifogging
methods of Burns' political heelers.
Despite the fact that the County Com
mittee of San Mateo County had been
promised that no appointment would
be made until the. 19th of January,
Saloon-keeper Byrnes was indorsed by
Congressman Loud on the 6th of the
month. ' .
"This is the nastiest piece of trickery
that has ever blighted* our local polit
ical affairs," said J. T. Jennings when
Been by a Call reporter at San Ma*""***
yesterday. "Mr. Parsons has been an
ardent Republican worker for years
back, and nearly everybody, in the
county favored his appointment as

by some of the most eminent residents
here, and both members of the State
Central Committee were in his fight.

WITTMAN LEADS THE DRUM CORPS ON PARADE
Steals a March on Chief Lees and Assumes the Honor of Introducing the Latest
Innovation in Police Circles to the Public.
HEAVY is the heart of Chief Lees.
That police drum corps has rat
a-planned up and down Van Ness
avenue, and the venerable chief
tain was not at the head of the proces
sion. .That proud distinction fell: to
the lot of Captain c. f. Wittman, while
your Uncle Isaiah, perforce, must sit
in his office and listen to the sweet
strains of his drums and see his
despised subordinate ride away at
their head.
That is why the heart of Chief Lees
is heavy.
Yet while he of the frost-bitten ex
tremities was receiving the adulations
of the happy nurse-ladies of the
aristocratic boulevard, : the Chief ;
sought comfort in the thought that his
day was coming; would be here, in
fact, on the 22d, Washington's birth
day, when the schools and business
houses would be closed and there
would be somebody out to admire him
besides nursemaids. But still the
Chief's grief was only half assuaged.
It might rain on Washington's birth
dayâoh, heavens! or he might come
down with the grip, and at all events
Wittman would have the glory of first
leading that drum corps on the avenue.
While the Chief stormed and fretted
I can see through the whole business.
When the County Committee refused
to lend its aid to elect Dan Burns the
latter influenced Loud to * indorse
Byrnes, whose father was a faithful
follower of the "Mexican" boss. We
were promised that whoever we recom
mended, would receive the appointment.
The man who has been appointed is a
saloon-keeper. We who have support
ed the Republican ticket at every elec
tion have been openly thrown down,
and the only thing we can do is saw
wood for two years and turn somebody
down at the polls next election. As
semblyman Brown went to the Legis
lature unpledged. The people of the
county elected him, knowing him to be
an honest, conscientious man, who
would do his duty by them regardless
of the consequences. He did not see
fit to vote for Dan Burns, and there is
not a man in the county but what
commends him for it? When men like
Dan Burns Interfere in a petty fight
of this kind It's time 'for the citizens
of the county to take a tumble.
"I have talked with all classes of Re
publicans since we were given this deal,
and without exception they denounced
the action of Burns in strong terms.
We have been turned down cold, and
if ever we get a chance to get even we
will grasp it with great pleasure."
"I went into this fight at the sugges
tion of my friends, little expecting to
incur the displeasure or opposition of
Colonel Dan Burns," said W. C. Par
sons. ,-*'-.
"I worked hard for the success of the
ticket, and felt entitled to some consid
eration at the hands of the leaders of
the party. My petition was signed by
many residents, and nearly everybody
who took any interest in the political
affairs of the county expressed a de
sire to see me get the appointment.
The appointment was to be made on
the 19th of January, and accordingly
after election I began to make my fight.
I went to San Francisco, and saw sev
eral" people high up in the councils of
the party, but got little satisfaction.
This did not discourage me, as I &new
that the place had been promised to
whomsoever the County Committee rec
ommended. While in San Francisco I

and In the second place I, know of no
man in the county who would advise
him to do so. I came back to San Ma
tea, and reported my interview with
Burns' man to Mr. Jennings. He saw
the play in a moment, but he still had
confidence in the promises made him
before election. When the i announce
ment that "Byrnes was recommended
for the position was made Mr. Jennings
telegraphed to Congressman Loud re
questing him to give j a reason for
breaking his promise. He answered
that my petition had been received too
late for consideration. On the surface
that looks like a plausible excuse, but
anybody with half an eye can see the
hand of Dan Burns behind it. Of

DICK WILLIAMS WILL
GET ANOTHER TRIAL
CIRCUIT COURT SAYS DE HAVEN
ERRED. '* " * * y
Juror Elliott Was Biased and Should
Not Have Been Ac
i ? y â¢â¢? v cepted.
The United States Clrcut Court has
granted Dick Williams a new trial for the
third time, he having been twice convict
ed of extorting $100 from Wong Sam for
landing a cousin of Cheong Deock. The
first trial occurred three years ago. Wil
liams was an interpreter for the Chinese
Bureau and Is said to have made about
$50,000 by charging the relatives of Chi
nese immigrants from $100 to $200 for al
lowing them . to land. On the first tral,
before Judge Morrow, It was proved that
he had a bank account of $14,000, whereas
he had not a dollar when he entered upon
the duties of his office.
Judge de Haven tried the case the sec
ond time it came up and an appeal was
taken on two groundsâ first, that the
court had erred in accepting Fred A. El
liott as a Juror after Mr. Elliott had said
that a" conversation between himself and
Lyman. Mowry, a former attorney for
Williams, had prejudiced him to the ex
tent of causing him to form an opinion
as to the guilt or innocence .of the de
fendant.
Elliott said that, 'notwithstanding the
opinion he had formed ,> he thought he
could give the accused a fair and impar
tial trial. The juror was challenged for
cause by the defense and the challenge
was disallowed. As the defense had ex
hausted its peremptorles it was forced to
accept the juror, * .â¢â¢Â« â¢ . â¢*â¢
The Court of Appeals, in an opinion,
handed down yesterday, held that Judge
de Haven had erred in accepting Elliott
as a juror. Authorities were quoted to
show that as there was a doubt as to
Elliott's eligibility to serve as a juror be
cause of bias, the benefit- of the doubt
should have been given to the defendant
and not to -the' Government. - ;

LINCOLN WAS
HONORED IN
THE SCHOOLS
Pupils Assemble in the Class Rooms to Do
? , Homage to the Memory of
the Martyr.
Reverence for the Dead Mingles With Patriotic
Enthusiasm Inspired by the Tales
of War Veterans.
LINCOLN day exercises were held in
all the public schools of the city yes
terday 'afternoon and evening, the
classrooms being appropriately dec
orated for the occasion with flags and
bunting, and the programmes in several
instances were quite elaborate. The
pupils manifested . great interest in the
addresses of the old war veterans, dele
gations of whom visited all the schools
and participated in the ceremonies. Their
patriotism was aroused to the highest
pitch of enthusiasm' by the anecdotes of
the camp and battle-field related for their
benefit, and they joined in singing the
stirring war songs with all the fervor
and lungpower they could muster. Stories
illustrating the sterling character and lov
ing tenderness of Lincoln brought tears
to the eyes of the children, but the tears
changed to laughter when some humorous
saying or Incident In which Lincoln had
figured as a boy or man was touched
upon. Y/i'7:
It was a day in which reverence for the
memory of the martyr President, which it
was sought to inspire inAne minds of the
young people, was made use of to foster
the natural love of country and the spirit
of patriotism which so dominated his life'
and which Is the safeguard of the Union.
The pupils responded in a manner highly
gratifying to those having charge of the
exercises. They listened with rapt atten
tion to everything relating to this grand
character in American history, but noth
ing appealed to them more than the in
tense patriotism of the man whose mem
ory .they had assembled to honor.
"At the Lincoln School the principal ad
dress was made by Professor Knowlton,
who paid a beautiful and touching tribute
to the character and life of Lincoln. He
said in part:
* "Abraham Lincoln stands alone in his
tory. In all the annals of our own coun
try or in those of the world his noble life
has no peer. ; "* â¦ --
"If any man ever began at. the bottom
he did. From earliest boyhood all.- kinds
of hardship were his. Through youth and
early manhood he knew every form of
the severest, trials i of personal poverty.
His rude, rough way wound darkly among
thick set discouragements. But it led ever
upward. Most disheartening difficulties
massed themselves -in front of him, but
he boldly .charged into the thickest of
them all.' They thronged' about him from
all sides, but he faced; and fought .them
in every direction. ,He fought* to win.
And all the world knows that he did win.
He would not down. No discouragements
daunted him; -no difficulty, defeated .him.
Humbly, patiently, perseveringly, pluck
ily, steadfastly, ' resolutely, hopefully., he
struggled onâhe I struggled outâ he strug- â¢

gave him more strength, and with his

Lincoln day exercises were held in the

School, the classroom being tastefully
decorated for the occasion. The pro
gramme-consisted of patriotic sOngs, reci

of various periods of his life, written and
read by the pupils of the school.
Thomas Schuck, a veteran of the Civil
War, and a member of Lincoln Post, G.

the war and exhibited a number of me
mentoes of his army life, including a
"hard tack" cracker issued on the eve of
the battle of Antietam. and a minie ball
which he stopped with his . body in a
cavalry charge at Lynchburg, Va., the
day before General Lee's surrender. He
regaled the pupils with his reminiscenced
for fully half an hour, and they greatly
enjoyed the recital.

Gardiner was all right, barring a nerv

who crowded about him should give
audible expression to their inward
comments on his performance.
Nevertheless, the tribe managed to
reach the avenue, where Captain Dun

Cook, with the Harbor- division, were
in waiting. The two forces were con
solidated and drilled for an hour.
Wittman's joy was not unalloyed,
however, for those drummers divided
the admiration of the humble civilians
with him, which, of course, will not
be the case when Chief Lees in all his
glory rides at the head of the column.
BUNKO MEN TRY
TO FLEECE A

Attempt to Ensnare, I.
W. Boydell.
HE DECLINED THE BAIT
ENTICED INTO A BOOM AND
TOLD TO PAY MONEY.
The Alarmed Tourist Finally Makes
His Escape Unshorn of His
Wealth by Speedily Tak
? ing to His Heels.
For the past two weeks the police have
been looking for a trio of the cleverest
bunko men who have been heard of in
this city in some time. They operated
about the leading hotels, and by smooth
work tried to mulct guests of their money.
The first knowledge the officers of the law
had of the presence In town of these
schemers was a complaint lodged at head
quarters last Saturday' evening by a
friend of I. W. Boydell,' a wealthy Aus
tralian squatter and sheep raiser, who
arrived on the Moana on the Bth of the
month and registered at the Occidental
The story told by the friend is only an
other of those clever schemes practiced
by bunko men, and is as follows* Mr
Boydell was seated in the corridor enjoy
ing an after-dinner smoke when three 1
well dressed strangers took : seats ' beside
him. -They immediately struck up a con
versation with the Englishman and pro
pounded a number of questions to him en
the raising of sheep in his country, the
profit to be derived from such business
and the chances strangers would have
there. . ..yy . -yJ-Y-:~:Y-'
Mr. Boydell, thinking they were guests
of the hotel who had been informed of -his
vast possessions, - readily answered their
inquiries. Seeing he was easy game the
spokesman of the party, who was' ad
dressed by his pals as "Judge," tried a
different tack with marked success He
explained to the promising dupe that ne
and his friends . had had some experience
in Alaskan -.mining, and: as their success
in the far north was meager they intended
trying their- fortunes in the Antipodes.
v._ Jud _' c PPeared- anxious to learn
whether the Ballarat mines were paying,
and then branched off into a -comparison
of the nuggets of the two regions. His
views did not meet the approval of his !
companions, and they .offered to prove to '
him that he was 'wrong in his assertions.
During the heated debate that followed
Mr. Boydell was an- interested listener, '
and he soon became convinced of the
earnestness of the participants. One
volunteered the. information that a friend '
of his had some specimens- from both
mining centers,' and offered to show them
in support of his contention. As was. --re- '
arranged his companion called the alleged
"bluff" and -.he .was- asked to display, the
samples. This he readily agreed to, and
the trio started on their erra,nd. As was
proper Mr. Boydell was- invited to accom- '
pany them,* and nothing loth lie went .
along. -â -.- â â .â¢-.-,Â»-- ,">--",'.-'.â  .. â -<-.* i.y;*-^-.-:
Boydell,: unsuspicious of any wrong, ?

bunko men, and they all wound up in a
small room on a side street.
, While one of â  the trio left -the room to
, get the nuggets â  the ; other two started a i
game of cards. > The "English tourist was
invited to take a hand, but he .declined,
saying he had never touched a card and -'<
had even refused, to play "penny-nap"
while on the ocean. As was their game
the*"Judge" began- to lose heavily, and
he appealed to Mr. Boydell to back him,
which request the latter promptly re
fused. The "Judge" very angrily; ob-

olt gradually dawned' on Mr. ; Boydell
that- he was among sharpers and he pre
pared to beat a hasty retreat. He tried
to leave in good -order, but the: two.
bunko men coolly told him that he was
loser to the c extent of $400. The "Judge"
angrily said to him:
2 "Why, if you object to paying your
honest gambling debts, I won't walk
down street with you." â ' , '"â â '.-
Not caring for that distinguished honor,
the unplucked sheep herder worked his
way to the exit and- then bolted, leav
ing the "bluffers" empty handed. On
reaching. his hotel he told friends of his
adventure,* and they laughed at the sim
ple way he was taken in. This made
Mr. Boydell feel sore, as he could have
parted with twice the sum demanded by
the schemers, as he is many times a mil
lionaire. â¢ During the three days he re
mained at the Occidental none Of the al
