Otis Cables to Lawton at Colombo to Hurry
His Troops Forward With All
Possible Dispatch.
COLOMBO, Island of Ceylon. Feb. 26, 6:30 a. m. â The United States transport Grant,
which sailed from New York for Manila on January 19 with troops under the command of Major
General Henry W. Lawton on board, arrived here to-day. General Lawton received a cablegram
from Major General Otis saying:
"Situation critical. Your early arrival necessary."
He also received from General Corbin. United States adjutant general, a cable dispatch
urging him to hurry. General Lawton ordered his officers to buy supplies regardless of expense,
and the transport is taking on coal and water hurriedly. She will try to reach Manila without
further stop.
NEW YORK, Feb. 23.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
telegraphs: With the arrival of
the German cruiser Kaiserin Au-
gusta at Manila to-day, and the
reports of filibustering expeditions from
Japan in the interest of Aguinaldo,
.there is a well defined suspicion in the
public mind here that the â¢political
ms" of Admiral Dewey for desir
i must be interpreted in
the broadest sense that her presence is
E much for moral effect in pre-
Ign interference as in
bringing the insurgents to terms.
The anxiety of the officials has
reached such a point there is no fur-
Eoubt that Rear Admiral Dewey
will be asked to submit an explanation.
The statement that Admiral Dewey's
dispatch came in open English is an
error. The department received from
him yesterday one relating to the ar
rival of the Yorktown, which was in ]
plain English, and the other relati.e to j
the Oregon, which was in the navy !
r. It was not intended that this \
dispatch shouid have been given pub
licity, but in the haste of preparation
of matter to go before the Cabinet it
escaped close scrutiny on the part of
Secretary Long and was permitted to
reach the press along with other cur
rent routine dispatches.
It was pointed out that this Govern
ment has an ample force at Manila to

While the authorities are anxious to
place at General Otis' disposal all the
troops he may need there seems to be
no apparent desire on his part for the
department to hasten reinforcements to
him. The statement in his dispatch
that no anxiety need be felt here had
a quieting effect, and the result was an
order this afternoon directing that two
companies of the Ninth Infantry be
sent to Vancouver Barracks, there to
take station, and that the remainder
of the regiment proceed to San Fran

It is now apparent to the authorities
that General Otis is confident he has
the situation well in hand and the only
thing over which they feel any concern
is Rear Admiral Dewey's mysterious
dispatch concerning the Oregon.
Secretary Long is quoted this morn

dispatch has no international signifi

Probably he wants a fine ship there,
as the American Commissioners are
about due, and it will give weight to
the American representations."

the way of establishing friendly com

the trade of the American nation, and
finding that it is impossible to do it her
self she is now bidding on a European
alliance to accomplish the result she
desires.
No apprehension exists that her ef
forts will be successful. In some quar

that Prince Radziwill spoke with

â *â  BERLIN, Feb. 25.â Much at- â¦

4- to the New York information of 4

Secretary Long in the above opinion.
It was said, with some degree of in
dignation, that Admiral Dewey would
hardly ask that a battleship of the
Oregon's proportions be dragged 3000
miles across the Pacific merely to pro
vide luxurious quarters for the Ameri
can Commissioners, or to impress a
handful of German marines with the
might of this government. The general
opinion expressed was that Admiral
Dewey, in sending his dispatch, had in
view much more serious business.
If the dispatch assigning "political
reasons" for desiring the presence of
the Oregon had been received from
some one less careful in his choice of
words and forms of expression than
Dewey the same importance might not
be attached to it. But Admiral Dewey
is a diplomat and far-sighted, and his
dispatches have all been remarkable for
their directness and their discrimina
tion in the use of words and phrases.
The use of the phrase "for political
reasons," coming from him is regarded
as surely bearing all the significance
that the most careful use of the words
could imply.
In Congressional circles the opinion
is almost universal that the dispatch
cannot relate to anything but an inter
national phase of the Philippine situ
ation. It is felt it does not necessarily
follow that any foreign complication is
actually at hand, though even that
might be inferred, but it is thought.
rather, that Dewey sees danger ahead
and desires to guard against it and to
prevent the development of a serious
crisis.
It is not thought among men abreast
of the situation that either the Presi
dent or the administration officials be
lieve in the explanation of the disDatch
which they want the public to accept.
The censored press dispatch announc
ing the meeting of foreign Consuls at
Manila, with the exception of the Brit
ish Consul, and that British sailors
have permission to land every evening
for the purpose "of wetting down th^
Consulate and banks," is regarded as
peculiarly significant, and is thousht
to furnish a key for the interpretation
of the Dewey dispatch, although th? of
ficials say they have not been advised
that the Consuls did meet.
The disposition In well-informed
Congressional circles is to look upon
the situation as threatening, if not ac
tually serious.

TO OVERTHROW
THE GOVERNMENT
OF GUATEMALA
Alleged Organization of a Filibus
tering Expedition to Invade
Central America.
KANSAS CITY, Feb. 25.â The Times wfll print to-morrow the de
tails of an alleged filibustering expedition having for its object the
overthrow of the Government of Guatemala, in Central America.
According to this story a regiment of a thousand men has been
formed in Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago, and a second regiment
has been formed in the East. Two companies are to leave Kansas City
by rail to-night, it is said, en route to the scene of the proposed inva
sion via St. Louis and New Orleans.
According to the information of the Times the two companies
formed in Kansas City have been recruited from volunteers recently
mustered out of the Third and Fifth Missouri Regiments. Two cap
tains of the Fifth Regiment and several non-commissioned officers of
the regiment are said to have been the recruiting officers at this point.
A representative of the Times was present at a meeting In a hail
here to-night at which 100 men signed for the expedition and pledged
themselves to secrecy. Another meeting at which fifty men signed was
held in another part of the city.
The volunteers were told that they would leave Kansas City Sunday
night, and that all the transportation by rail and water had been ar
ranged for.
A Guatemalan named Sandoval, the representative of a former
Governor of Guatemala, is said to be the organizer of the expedition,
and it is stated that the invaders are to receive their pay in grants
of land and other privileges in the event of the success of the revolu
tion.
Colonel Milton Moore, late commander of the Fifth Missouri Regi
ment, was offered command of the expedition, through a Kansas City
lawyer, who spoke for Sandoval, but Colonel Moore states that he re
fused to have anything to do with the filibusters.
Committee of the House to-day di
rected a favorable report on the Senate
bill creating the grade of admiral and
intended for Rear Admiral Dewey. The
bill was recently added as a* amend
ment to the naval appropriation bill,
but as some question was raised as to
this method of procedure the commit
tee determined to report the bill as an
independent measure.
The committee also acted favorably
on the Senate bill granting two months'
extra pay for naval service outside the
United States during the war with
Spain.
FIRE OF FILIPINOS
IS MORE ACCURATE
MANILA, Feb. 25.â Later reports
show there was considerable fighting at
Caloocan last night. The Filipinos are
becoming more accurate in their firing.
During the skirmish last night two
Americans on the railroad were slight
ly wounded. A member of the Kan
sas regiment was shot through the head
this morning. It is believed his wound
is mortal.
A Spaniard with a flag of truce came
through the lines of the Kansas regi
ment this morning at half past 8
o'clock. Filipinos are visible in force to
the northward.
The deputation from Negros Island
which came here after the people there
had accepted the rule of the United
Stats is evidently pleased with its re
ception. Its members will return to
Bacolet. the capital of the island, on
Tuesday.
The military police have raided sev
eral suspected houses in the various
districts, capturing small bodies of
twenty or thirty persons in each place.
This and the 7 o'clock ordinance is ef
fectually dispelling the fears of the na
tives of a tkreatened outbreak, who
did not care, singly or collectively, to
appear on the streets after dark. The
feeling in the city has decidely im
proved.

Is generally believed that the disas
trous attempts to attack the city and
destroy property, the Filipinos them
selves being the worst sufferers, will
prevent their recurrence, but every pre
caution is being taken to deal with an
emergency if it arises. The insurance
agents refuse to entertain any claims
on account of Wednesday's fires. They
intimate that General Otis, having
guaranteed the safety of life and prop
erty of the inhabitants, is responsible
for these claims.

POSITION OF SPANIARDS
BECOMING INSECURE
MADRID, Feb. 25.â General Rios,
who commanded the Spanish troops in
the Philippines, cables from Manila
that the position of the Spaniards there
is "becoming very insecure, owing to
the movement of the insurgents of the
town."
The Chamber of Deputies continued
I the debate on the peace treaty, the dis
' cuÃsion consisting mainly, of personal
1 recriminations by the members.
Senor â¢ Sagasta eloquently eulogized
the heroism of the army. He did not
deny that some might have failed in
their duty, but did not believe that in
dividual faults could be laid to the
army as a whole. ,
"If, " continued the Premier, "a di
rect accusation is made, the Govern
ment is prepared to bring the guilty
persons before the courts."
Senor Sagasta declared that it was
untrue that the country had lost con
fidence in the army.

WAS THE PARIS
POPULACE READY
FOR REVOLUTION?
Failure of Deroulede's Attempt to
Incite Roget to Treason De
clared a Miracle.
Special Cable to The Call and the Kew York
Heralo. Copyrighted. IS9S, by James Gordon
Bennett.
PARIS, Feb. 23.â 1t was only after the
Faure funeral ceremony was over that
political feeling pent up out of respect
to the dead, so innate in the French,
commenced to find vent and expression,
and then the army received an un
qualified ovation.
It seems a miracle that M. Derou
lede's attempt to incite General Roget
to treason hung fire. Certain it is that
the enormous crowd on the Place de la
Nation if once supported by General
Roget would have swept everything be
fore them. The Place de la Republique
is on the direct line of march, where
they were at the time. It is estimated
that about 500,000 people crowded the
Place, and gave the generals a splendid
reception as they passed. Several re
cognized acclamations by raising their
hats and smiling, while other generals
and officers merely saluted.
As the soldiers entered the barracks
on the Place de la Republique they
were cheered so wildly that the sound
was deafening.
It is useless forming opinions as to
what might have happened if Derou
lede had been successful, because he
was not. Still I give you the situation
as it looked to me the day of the af
fair. As it was. Deruulede simply
walked into a trap. The gates of the
barracks closed upon him, thus reliev
ing the Government of all responsibil
ity of taking any initiative in the af
fair.
If guilty of nothing more or less than
sedition, M. Deroulede has committed
an unpardonable sin in making himself
ridiculous, so dangerous to would-be
leaders in politics in Paris. One paper
practically calls him a historical per
son who cannot exercise sufficient self
control to keep his mouth shut when he
ought to, and says he let himself be
carried away by the ardor of his tem
perament. Desmoulins says General
Roget is he whom the revisionists con
sider the soul of the military plot, and
adds in conclusion in his article that
he heard some one on the boulevard
exclaiming in connection with Derou
lede, "A brave fellow, what a pity he
didn't succeed," which, however, the
writer does not appear to share.
An interesting detail about M. Lou
bet's appearance in public yesterday is
that his reception was lukewarm on the
part of the enormous sea of people en
joying the Parisian holiday. Only one
person was reported at a late hour at
the Prefecture for having cried "A bas
Loubet!" But while M. Loubet was
not insulted, he was not even ordinar
ily well acclaimed. On his return from
the funeral his carriage was almost lost
in \ the swarm of dragoons who escorted
him at a gallop.
I hear any amount of funny things
which have been going on at the For
eign Office in connection with M. Lou
bet. He is already said to have in
vented the word, "norgatau" for "nou
gat."
It is said that M. Loubet and M. Cm
zier, the introducer of Embassa
dors, have already had extraordinary
dialogues. M. Crozier very naturally
argues he must do something for his
money as he arranges ceremonies and
gives officials points about state eti
quette. M. Crozier urged that M. Lou
bet on the evening of his election
should stop at the Foreign Office, as it
was the proper thing to do, seeing that
the late President's family has not left
the Elysee. but to M. Croxier's despair
M. Loubet positively refused, saying he
was goinÂ«r home to his wife and chil
dren, state etiquette or not.

ANGLO-FRENCH STRAIN
SERIOUSLY INCRIASED
NEW YORK, F-b. 23.â A cable to the
j Journal from London says: There has
: been a temporary halt for some un
! known reason in Lord Salisbury's ne
: gotiations with Embassador Cambon
i for the settlement of disputes between
England and France. There has been
j no conferences: between these two dip
lomats during the last week, although
: the Muscat incident led to an exchange
, of communications between the Foreign
I Offices of the two countries.
The French declare they had no no
| tion of obtaining a strip of territory
in the province of Oman on the Persian
j Gulf, but only a coal depot for the ben
i efit of trade.
The English action in forcing the
i Sultan of Oman to refuse the French
: request was neither correct nor polite
'' to France, so the diplomats across the
; channel assert. Coming on the heels of
J the Shanghai affair, it tends t<> prove
i to the Parisian mind the persistent ill
will of Great Britain toward France.
On the other hand. English diplomats
! assert that France by a secret intrigue
'> purchased from the Sultan of Oman a
j coaling station, and the agreement <lid
â  not forbid it being fortified. The sum
â  of the whole matter is. however, that
i the Anglo-French strain has seriously
increased.

Sun from London says: A Central
News dispatch from Brussels says the
Duke of Orleans started this evening

some time, ~oing thence to the Riviera
before returning to England with the
Duchess. The dispatch says that the
Duke has abandoned all hope of an im

A CABLE TO THE

Senate Committee Agrees to Incor-

WASHINGTON', Feb. 23.â The Sen
ate Committee on Appropriations to
day agreed to incorporate a provision
in the sundry civil appropriation l>i!l
providing for the construction of a sub
marine cable connecting the United
States with the Hawaiian Islands. The
amendment adopted is the one intro
duced by Senator Butler, and it pro
vides for the laying of tne cable by the
United States and for its subsequent
ownership by the Government, the
Navy Department to perform the ser
vice and the cable when completed to
be operated by the Postoffice. Depart
ment.
Senator Butler's original proposition
provided for the extension of th^ cable
to the Philippine Islands, but the com
mittee decided not to make provision
for this extension because of the un
certainty of tenure of the United States
in the last-named islands.
Senator Butler made a statement be
fore the committee showing that the
cable could be laid to Honolulu for
$6,942,000.2
STRUGGLE OF THE
SENATORIAL FIGHT
IS NOW AT HAND
Important Changes in the Situation Predicted
for This Week.
BURNS' LAST DESPERATE EFFORT
The Mexican Is Given Until Next Wednesday to Bring to
Light His Boasted Supporters or Lose Mnch of His
Present Backing.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 25.â The belief that there
will be important changes in the Sena
torial situation next week is gaining
strength every hour. Members of the
Legislature who are not directly or re
motely connected with the "machine"
or race track elements express the
judgment that Burns cannot win, but
all agree that the colonel will put up a
hard fight to make some headway next
week.
The assertion that the Southern Pa
cific people are growing uneasy and
apprehensive over the colonel's failure
to develop strength is not idle rumor.
Several agents of the company have
been here to size up the contest and
submit a report of observations to Mr.
.Herrin.
Burns did have the impression firmly
fixed in Herrin's mind that a caucus
would take place after a few ballots.
When Dan failed to secure the caucus
at the time promised all the railroad
organs in the State, headed by the
Sacramento Record-Union, joined in a
general whip-cracking to force the cau
cus on the ground that the Republican
party demanded a speedy breaking of
the deadlock. Simultaneously county
â¢ committee meetings were quietly work
ed up and prepared resolutions adopted
demanding that Senators and Assem
blymen sign for. a caucus. Every in
telligent and independent Republican in
â¢ the Legislature saw at unce that the
appeal emanated from the railroad and
not from the people, and again the cau
cus scheme failed.
When the history in detail of the
MEXICAN DAN-" IF I CAN'T BREAK IT NO ONE ELSE SHALL."
i Senatorial struggle is written facts will j
J be produced showing that unspeakable ,
efforts were employed to force members
of the Legislature to subscribe to the !
caucus proposition. The wives and sis- |
ters of legislators were importuned to i
use their influence to bring about the j
result. Anonymous letters threatening [
exposure of moral delinquencies on the
path of legislators were sent to ladies.
Meanwhile the touts and persons de
riving a livelihood from the gambling j
propensities of the public assembled i
here in swarms and openly predicted \
that Burns had won the fight. The only j
result of the great hubbub was the de
sertion from Bulla to Burns of poor old
Simpson.
To-night the story is circulated and
generally credited that Burns must j
drag forth his staked-out men in the
open light <>f the joint convention. |
Wednesday next is the day designated
for the dragging out. In this connec
tion the statement is also made that
j Herrin demanded and obtained a list
of the members of the Legislature that
could be counted on to support Burns
:on the final round-up. The Call is in
formed that the list contains the names
jof Senators and Assemblymen who
never will consent to vote for Dan
! Burns.
The men who have in their hands the
management of the Senatorial candi
dacy of U. S. Grant declare that with
i possibly two or three exceptions the
legislators who are voting for him now
will vote for him to the end and will
resist any inducements that may be of
fered them to cast their votes for
Thomas R. Bard. Some days ago Sen
ator Boyr-e, when instructed by the
Ventura County Committee to change
i his vote from Grant to Bard, replied
iÂ±iJ!i : Â»ah ittAJSItIBCO CAlili, BTJKDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1899.
that he did not propose to take orders
from Dan Burns and the Southern Pa
cific Company even through the med
ium of the committee of one of the
counties within his Senatorial district.
In making this assertion he expressed
the sentiments of others who, like him,
are voting for Grant. Senator Boyce
believes that the railroad is behind the
scheme to bcom Bard for Senator. He
also believes that Mr. Bard has no
knowledge of this fact.
The Grant men have refused to have
anything to do with the proposition te
hold a conference of Republican legis
lators Monday afternoon for the same
reason that they refuse to consider
Bard as a legitimate factor in the Sen
atorial fight. They contend that such a
j conference as the one proposed is ad
vocated solely for the purpose of mak
ing it a stepping-stone to a secret cau
cus. All who have the slightest knowl
edge of the situation know that a se
cret caucus is the only means by which
Burns can hope to win. The Grant
people declare that if he cannot win
legitimately and in the open he shall
not win at all, and for that reason
they intend to oppose every scheme
that has for its object the holding of a
secret caucus.
The call for the proposed conference
provides that there shall be no discus
sion of the merits of any particular
candidate; that no vote shall be taken
as to any candidate, and that no vote
taken on any matter brought before the
conference will be binding. To the man
in the middle of the road this appears
on its face to be the veriest nonsense
that sober and presumably intelligent
legislators ever gave ear to. Still, al
most fifty of them have signed the call
and will, presumably, take part in the
rag-chewing match to-morrow after
noon.
It is easy to tell in advance what will
be done on the part of the Burns con
tingent at the conference. Such well
known and justly celebrated orators as
Dibble, Johnson and Shc-rtridge will be
present in force and will tell the assem
bled legislators that the only way to
break the Senatorial deadlock is for all
to agree to become parties Ur that
"time-honored and noble institution the
secret caucus." This will be the burden
of their song, and if they can succeed
in convincing any one of their hearers
that the glitter of their sophistry is
pure gold they will have gained a point
for Burns.
Small wonder that the Grant adher
ents are not in favor of a conference
that can only serve to give to the Burns
orators a chance to tell of the great
things that may be accomplished by a
secret caucus.
A LEGISLATURE OF
A THOUSAND JUNKETS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 25.â Following the excellent
example set before it by the Senate, the
Assembly has gone shy on its working
capital.
Attaches whose appointments were au
thorized and attaches who are simply
working on a "shoe string," that is to
say, no authorized appointment at all,
have pocketed the better part of the As
sembly's cash and more must be had. An
other item of expense that has footed up
no small total has been created by the
weekly junketing trips of the different
standing committees. If some one of the
State institutions has ncedofl a $15nn ice
making plant or a few hundred yards of

To anticipate the deficit two appropria

NO FAVORS SHOWN
TO THE UNIVERSITY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 25.â The State University
had a bad half hour before the Senate to
day. Tho subject was broached in an
amendment submitted by Senator Rowell
to Valentine's Assembly bill 914, relating
to State printing:.
Valentines bUI directs that all public
printing be done at the State Printing:
Office at the expense of the funds of the
several institutions ordering the work.
The bill specifically mentions the print
ing for the Regents, and Senator Rowell's
amendment was to strike out this refer
ence and so allow the university to go on
as it has been, running its own printing
office and doing most of its own printing,
I. .sides the work on the Occident.
Boyce, Smith and Dickinson opposed the
amendment, for they believed the univer-
I sity should have no more latitude in the
I line of printing than any other of the pub
j lie Institutions. Dickinson referred to the
financial affairs of the institution and de
clared that it was not run according to
business principles. He referred to money
j which had been spent uselessly, directing
I attention particularly to the scandal dur-
I Ing the last session of the Legislature
! over a bill put in by Julius Kahn for $2500
for work in the Legislature.
Smith spoke of the printing office at the
college and declared it was almost a rival
to the State institution. He said he was
opposed to granting any more power in
: a financial form to any institution which
was done In such a slipshod, run-down-at
the-heel policy as was Berkeley ("ollepe.
I He said there was just as much reason
for printing offices in the prisons and hos
pitals as at the university.
Rowell defended the Regents. He said
they had handled millions of money and
for the thirty years they had run the In
stitution they had never had a scandal.
He said there was a prejudice against the
university in the Senate and he did not
expect his amendment to pass. He said
the printing office at the college is run
partly by the students and that they turn
out the work at a cost much less than at
the State office. The amendment was lost,
however, and the university office must
suffer.
FAIRWEATHER WAS
LOCALLY ZEALOUS
A Letter From Washington Ex
plains Conditions of State
Irrigation.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 25.â 1n his zealous efforts
to get the Government to build irrigation
ditches and impounding dams in Fresno
County Assemblyman Kairweather has at
tracted the attention of the officials of
the Geodetic and Geological Survey at
Washington.
A month or more ago Mr. Fairweather
introduced Assembly bill 538, which pro
vides that a commissioner shall be ap-
pointed to co-work with tne Geodetic sur
veyors in making surveys in the San
Joaquin Valley and other arid lands, for
reservoir sites, dams and other appurte
nances to the impounding and storing of
water. The bill further provided that the
first work should be done in the Kings
River Valley in Fresno County.
Fairweather has made a hot fight for his
bill and has evidently sent some glowing
messages to Washington. One of them
has brought the following reply, a copy
i of which every member of the Assembly
received to-day:
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20, 1599.-Hon. John
Fairweather, Assembly Chamber. Sacramento.
a l âDear Sir: I have received yours of the
Sth'lnÃt. and in reply wish to say that In It
you make some statements which are incorrect,
and as you are no doubt making them to your
colleagues I shall send a copy of this letter
to every member so they will all know the
â¢ â  x ' t ' ' t i &cts.
Referring to the proviso in Assembly bill 533
that surveys shall be made on Kings River you
! nay in your letter: â¢
"If we are beaten out of that proviso we will
not see a cent In the San Joaquin Valley."
This la a statement that should not be made.
The Geological Survey assure us that surveys
will be made on Kings River, but It ie their
desire, if sufficient funds can be made avail
able, to begin work simultaneously in the ban
.Toaquln Valley and -in Southern California.
Furthermore, under a Senate resolution, they
have Just prepared a report as to surveys for
reservoirs (Senate document No. 116, Fifty
! fifth Congress, ' third session) and on page 19
I thereof Mr. Newell, speaking of the San Joa
[ quln Valley, says: ""The most pressing need
of reservoirs, however, is probably on the head
water of Kings River."
I Again, under this bill, the Governor, through
his commissioner, has control of the location of
surveys and, as Governor of the whole State,
would unquestionably consider the relative
needs of every section. â¢
Under these circumstances, It is questioning
the good faith and fairness of the Geological
Survey. and of the Governor to insert such a
clause in the bill and you have no basis for
any such statement as that quoted above. Its
Insertion would of course enable you to make
to your constituents the statement quoted from
your letter to your own advantage, but sueh 1
sectional and personal considerations should
have no recognition in framing a. measure of
this nature.
The greatest difficulty we have to overcome
in the regeneration of our irrigation situation
In California Is this narrow and selfish disposi
tion to grab for petty local advantages without
recard to benefits on a broad scale for the
whole commonwealth. I would regret very!
much to see this Legislature Indorse your very
narrow and mistaken policy.
We have secured from the Senate Commerce
Committee here a favorable recommendation of
the Warren amendments providing for the con
struction or reservoirs under the hittenden
survey, and appropriating $50,000 for the survey
of one or more sites In every arid nd semi-arid
State If we can get this through the Senate
and fun the gauntlet of the conference com
mittee it Insures not only the survey of sites
in California through the War Department, but
the/building of the reservoirs if the people will
only follow wise counsels and bury all section
-3 But' even though we succeed with these ap
propriations in the river and harbor bill, they
have nothing to do with the Geological Survey,
and Assembly till 538, - with the reference to
Kings River stricken out. should be passed by
the California Legislature, because we are
bending every effort here to get the Geological
Survey appropriation Increased to *1Â«> 000. so
they will have ample funds to co-operate with
the State In surveys in California. *â 
Again, in your letter you say: I believe it
is a mistake to not pay the commissioner his
legitimate expenses which he must be at. It
Is impossible for him to do all required of him
without expense." i . "
In this you are mistaken because the duties
Of the commissioner will be wholly perfunc
tory, and he need not incur any expense what
soever in their discharge. In my previous letter
mailed to members of the Irrigation committees
and to you. I explained the only reason why it
seemed advisable to have a commission. I sin
cerely hope that you will not overlook the fact
that surveys, although they may impound
, votes will not Impound water, and that we are
working for the actual construction of these
reservoirs, and must adhere to a broad polio
which will unite not only the whole State of
California, but the whole West, In a policy
which will lay. aside all personal and local
selfishness and work patiently for the greatest
good to the greatest number.
The policy of Federal reservoir construction,
when finally adopted and firmly rooted, la broad
enough to cover every locality and community
and all must participate in Its *â¢JÂ«JÂ»i T I? vâ¢u â¢
very truly. GEORGE 11. SIAXWEL.U.

A LITTLE JOKER
THAT SLIPPED IN
Trouble in Store /or the County
Government Bill When It
Conies Up.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 25.â There is trouble in
store for the county government bill when j
It returns from the hands of the printer, j
It has been before the proper committees j
of both houses of the Legislature and has j
been considered at the expense of several
valuable hours and still it has gone to the
printer with an important provision that |
It is not at all certain should be there.
The bill is one that was introduced In 1
the Senate by Senator Davis and in the i
House by Assemblyman Kelly. Roth bills .
are entitled "An act to amend r.r act en
titled an act to establish a uniform sys
tem of county and township government." ;
The Senate bill is a duplicate of the one
introduced in the Assembly, and they j
have been passed upon by the County \
Government committees of both houses
and by a joint committee. The Senate
committee had the bill before it a week
ago, and before the committee was also a
delegation from San Francisco which had
a joker to slip in. The clause the dele- <
gation wanted Included in the bill was
one to hold in office until 1903 the county
ufflcers of San Francisco who would have
held office under the county government
act now in force, for four years. It was
represented to the Senate committee that
the incumbents would never have run for
office had they any idea that they would |
not hold for four years, but under judi- ;
clous questions from members of the com- j
mlttee it was brought out that there was .
a full knowledge of the possibilities of the
charter being adopted and the consequent I
shortening of the terms by reason of a ,
new election under the new law.
Edgar Piexotto. attorney for the Sheriff,
Al Berthier. Recorder, and \V. A. Deane,
County Clerk of San Francisco, made up
the committee. They wanted an amend- ;
ment tacked on to the county government
bill allowing them to hold office regardless ;
of any new charter election, but the Sen
ate committee would not see it that way,
and the amendment, although considered,
was not adopted. In the Assembly com
mittee, however, It fared better. After a
long argument the desired amendment
waa added to the Assembly bill. Last j
night there was a meeting of the joint
Committee on County Government of the j
Assembly and that of the Senate and the j
county government bill was considered, ]
but no amendments such as the one pro
viding for the extra term for city offi
cials was passed. The bill was otherwise
thoroughly thrashed over and was or
dered sent to the printer.
Some of the Senators who are interested
in the bill took a laet look at it just before
it went over to the printing office, and
they struck a surprise in section 58Mi.
which provides that all county officers
elected in San Francisco in 1898 and whose
terms commenced January 1. 1899, should
hold office until January 1. 1903, or com- .
plete the four-year term which the char- \
ter expressly denies them.
There was a commotion at once. The
clerk of the Senate committee declared
he had no record of the amendment ever
having passed the Senate committee, and
he showed his notes to prove it. Senators .
and Assemblymen and clerks who attend
ed the session of the joint committee j
agree that the amendment was never I
passed by the joint committee, but the]
amendment is there, and now it will have ]
to be fought on the floor of the Senate.
It Is partially explained by one of the
clerks, who says that the amendment,
having been adopted by the Assembly
committee, was pasted in the bill, and
when the measure was considered by the
Senate committee it was overlooked ami I
went to the printer as coming from the
Senate committee as well as the Assem
bly committee, but it is a bad mistake and
may lead to a great deal of trouble and
delay before it is finally rectified.
There was some talk also of the manip
ulation of the amendment for the pur
pose of making a voluntary mistake, but
the prominent fact is that the amendment
is thorp and with the consent of but one
half the legislative body.
The unwelcome amendment is consid
ered particularly obnoxious because of
the results which may follow Its adop
tion. Should the Legislature be empow
ered to step in and say that officers whom j
the charter says shall hold office for two '
years may hold for four, there is no tell
ing what else it may do In the way of nul
lifying the new system of city govern
ment.
It was well known at the time the elec
tion was held in San Francisco that there
was every possibility that the charter
would pass and that it would be ratified
by the Legislature and that in the event
of such a combination of circumstances
the term of the officers elected at the
election last November would be only un
til there should be another election under
the new organic law of the city. The
claim that some of the officers believed
they were to hold for four years was
Bcoffed at by the Senate committee and
that is the reason there is much feeling
over the unexpected joker in the bill now
being printed.
STATE PRINTING BILL
PASSED UNDER SUSPENSION
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 25.â Valentine's Assembly
bill 914 was passed through the Assembly
to-day under a suspension of the rules.
The bill radically changes the present sys
tem of operating the State Printing Office,
and Mr. Valentine claims it will save
$156,000.
The bill directs that reports of State
officers, boards of officers, commissions,
trustees, regents and directors, required
or authorized by law to make reports, or
to publish any circulars or bulletins, and
all printed books, stationery or printed
matter of any kind must be printed, ruled
and bound at the State Printing Office,
at the expense of the officer, board, com
mission and so forth, ordering the print
ing done.
The Superintendent of State printing is
to determine the charge necessary for do
ing the work and must render an item
ized bill for the same to the officer, board
or commission ordering the printing.
These bills are to be audited for the State
Board of Examiners. The money so re
ceived composes the fund for the State
Printing Office.

GOMEZ TO VISIT
THE PRESIDENT
Aged Chief Is Coming to
Washington.
THINKS McKINLEY FAVORS CU
BAN INDEPENDENCE.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Hera! :. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gordon
Bennett.
HAVANA. Feb. 2.".â Maximo Gomez
has decided to visit Washington and
have a personal interview with Presi
dent McKlnley, who is regarded by the
veteran insurrectionist as a great
statesman and the ablest man Amer
ica has produced since the civil war.
There are intimates of Gomez who
say that he has held these sentiments
less than a year, but be that as it may,
Gomes is open in his regard for Mc-
Kinley and believes he is earnestly in
favor of absolute independence for
Cuba.
I attempted to obtain an interview
with the Cuban chieftain on the sub
ject t.<-Jay, but found him too much
fatigued to talk. My authority, htrw
ever. is unimpeachable, being a warm
personal friend of Gomez, to whom he
expressed himself yesterday.
Gomez will not go north until the
weather moderates and settles, but he
will reach Washington, according to
present plans, not later that April 20.
In visiting the President General
Gomez believes he will be able to reach
an understanding regarding the fea
ture which will be of great advantage
to Cuba. It is known he agreed to ac
cept J3.000.000 to pay the troops with
the understanding that under certain
conditions the United States would
agree to guarantee Cuban bonds for a
much larger amount. It is to discuss i
these conditions that Gomez desires to j
visit the White House. He objects, it ,
is well understood, to continued mili
tary occupation of the island, though !
he might agree to grant a naval sta
tion in Havana harbor and American

OPPOSITION TO
COMPROMISE ARMY
BILL IN SENATE
Permanent Increase of Regular
Troops Declared by Gorman
to Be a Menace to the
Country.
"WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.â After two
hours devoted to the consideration of
bills on the calendar to-day, the Sen
ate at 1 o'clock began the consideration,
of the compromise army reorganization
, bill. Until a short time before the mea
sure was taken up it was supposed it
' would be passed to-day without serious
difficulty, but when it was learned by j
some Senators that the hill provided
for a permanent increase in the stand
ing- army objections were heard, and it
became evident that the measure would
have to run the gauntlet of sharp
criticism.
Gorman (D.) of Maryland declared j
that no authorization of a permanent
increase should be given, and prepared
an amendment as follows:
â¢That each and every provision of
this act shall continue in force until
July 1, 1901, and on and after this date {
the officers and men, including general !
officers and staff officers, shall be re
stored to rank and numbers as provided
for by law prior to April 1, 1898, except
the cadets appointed prior to July 1.
1901, and except as provided for in the
act to authorize two additional regi
ments of artillery, approved March S, ,
1898."
- Speeches in support of the bill were
delivered by Hawley of Connecticut,
Cockrell of Missouri, Carter of Mon
tana, and Smith of New Jersey, and
against it by Gorman of Maryland and
Allen of Nebraska.
Cockrell, who has consistently op
posed a large standing army, gave the
pending measure his unequivocal and
unqualified support, declaring it was
the best army measure ever submitted
to Congress. No agreement to vote on
the bill had been reached when the
Senate adjourned.
Hawiey. chairman of the Military Af
fairs Committee, called up the compro
mise army reorganization bill. -, -: -5-
At the conclusion of the reading of the
bill. Gorman of Maryland suggested to
Hawley the desirability of permitting the
bill to go over to Monday. -*.-'.-,,
Allison of lowa suggested that a time
for a vote early on Monday should be
agreed upon at this time. Some effort
was made to fix an hour Monday for a
vote, but without success.
Cockrell of Missouri, a member of the
Military Affaire Committee, discussed at
length the features of the measure. "This
measure." said he. "has been examined
very carefully. I indorse it because it. is
right just, proper and necessary. It set
tles for years to come the standing army
Â°Furtner in his analysis of the bill,
Cockrell said the increase in the army
provided for by the bill was "perfectly
justifiable and absolutely essential.
In response to a question by vest, he
said that the army after 1901 would be re
duced to 38,400. and that number would be
required to take care of the coast fortifi-
Ca inÂ° n conciusion. Cockrell said: "If we
ha?e a bill here which will adjust the
army controversy for years to come we
oupht to accept it. It is not prodigal of
honestly and conscientiously that this is

Â°e Ali e d n"of Nebraska addressed the Senate
in opposition to the genera features of
the bill He was surprised that Cockrell
could give his sanction to such a meas
ure "If there was a hideous skeleton a
monstrosity, a deformity in legislation,
this bill is one." he declared. It is
' warped, disjointed, dislocated It lacks
S science, it lacks coherence, it lacks good
; sense I am not concerned in this de
. lightful fight now going on between the
Secretary of War and the genera com
manding the army. I honor General Miles
:In that fight. Every intelligent man in
' the country believes that our army was
â  fed on trash and that a large percentage
of the sickness and mortality in the army
was due to the food given to the soldiers.
Passing from the army troubles. Allen
adverted to some in the navy. He re
garded it as a glorious thing that Admiral
Dewey had the presence of mind to cut
the cable between himself and Washing
ton, and that it was fortunate for Dewey
I he was in a position to sever connection
with Washington.
"Then, too, said Allen, "we have the
controversy over the two rear admirals
In the navy. Whether the man . who
fought the battle resulting in the destruc
tion of Cervera's fleet and won it shall
have the laurels of victory or whether
they shall go to a man who was ten miles
away seems a subject of controversy by
the Navy Department.
"The American people, seventy million
of honest hearts and souls, will always
believe that Schley was the hero 'of that
battle, and won that battle, and I am not
detracting anything from the service of
Admiral Sampson, who. if he. had been
there, would have acquitted himself no
bly. This seems to be a game of battle
dore and shuttlecock, and over in the
Navy Department they are shedding more
ink than blood." â  . â¢
"It shall not be said of me," said Gor
man, "that I would hamper the adminis
tration In any respect. It shall have all
the men and all the money to dispose of
the conditions at hand that it may need,"
Gorman said that if one proviso were
contained in the bill to the effect that at
the expiration of two years the army
should again be reduced to a peace foot-
Ing of 27,000 men he would agree to it.
POISON IN THE
REFRESHMENTS
Church Social Patrons
Near to Death.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA ROSA, Feb. 25.â Sebastopol,
seven miles west of here, was the scene
of a â wholesale poisoning last night.
More than forty persons are seriously
affected, and several are even yet in a
precarious condition.
The poisoning occurred at a church
social given by the Ep worth League of
Pleasant Hill church, at which there
was a large attendance. The affair
broke up at about 11 o'clock. Two
hours later Dr. Benepe was hurriedly
summoned to the bedside of a patient
who was in convulsions. On the way
to the patient's home he met two other
messengers searching for him, and in a
few moments Drs. Miller and Hardin,
other physicians of the place, were
hurrying out in response to urgent
calls. Until after daylight thiÂ« morn
â 'But -whatever the conditions may be," \
he continued, "with the acceptance of the
proviso I suggest you will have an army
of 100,000 men until four months after the !
term of President McKinley shall expire. I
The measure will give him greater power |
than a President ever had. It is a tender i
of greater power than was ever made in i
similar circumstances. I
Hawley ; had ' asked who was afraid of
the large standing army. In reply Gor- ;
man said that every State in the Union I
was afraid of it. He (Gorman) was afraid I
of it himself. Such an Institution was â¢
contrary to the spirit of our affairs. He !
recalled the time when, in 1576, troops .
were summoned to Washington at the ;
time of the Hayes-Tilden controversy.
"I remember the quiet Intimidation of !
the presence of the troops." said Gorman.
He had gTeat personal respect for Mr.
McKinley and had no- criticism except
that In his good nature he had permitted
weakness and inefficiency in the depart
ments. "Weakness, I say," repeated the
Senator. Time alone could reveal whether
there had been anything else. He was
asked to have confidence in the Chief Ex
ecutive, but he could not forget that hu
man nature was weak. He computed that
for next year the expenditure on account
of the army and navy would aggregate
$369,000,000, greater than the total expendi
tures of the Government for 1871 to 1876.
He predicted a deficiency of $180,000,000.
Then there must be an increase of the di
rect taxation or more bonds or certifi
cates. "Even now I hear that the Secre
tary of the Treasury Is contemplating the
issue or more Government obligations."
Tillman asked if the Philippine rebellion
could nit be put down by volunteers, and
Gorman said he saw no reason why it
should not be. But this was not the de
sire. The wish was to have more shoul
der straps and more men to wear them.
Insignificant as were the achievements of
the army comparatively -In the Spanish
war, there had been appointed as officers
in the army more men than had received
such advancement during the first year
of the Rebellion, with all the South in
arms. Never were brigadier generals so
thick In Washington. There were a suffi
cient number of them alone to suppress
an ordinary rebellion. Gorman declared
that under the present head of the army
a proper organization of the service could
not be effected.
Tillman, interrupting Gonnan â Then
there is nothing in the bill to prevent the
recurrence of the embalmed beef scan
dal?
Gorman passed off the question lightly,
saying he knew little about it.
Tillmanâ None of us know anything
about it, perhaps, but there is so much
of it in the air we can smell it.
"I do know this," replied Gorman. "The
Secretary of War is a much-abused man.
He is not responsible for the department
in which that scandal originated, a de
partment in which the officers are ap
pointed for life."
Gorman, in conclusion, made an appeal
to the Senate to fix the number of men
and the amount of money necessary to
meet present exigencies, and both would
be given them if only a time limit were
placed on the call. If this Suggestion of
his was refused . and the bill forced
through Congress, then let the respon
sibility be taken by those who advocate it.
Carter, a member of the Military Af
fairs Committee, replied to Gorman. He
said that every auditor of Gorman,
a felicitous and eloquent orator, must
have been impressed with the pathetic
solicitude of the Maryland Senator for the
present Republican national administra
tion.
After discussing the "cry of mili
tarism" .Carter declared: "Militarism
comes to us as a necessity, not as a de
sire. The present conditions were evolved
from the war with Spain. That -war was
evolved from the sense of outraged, hu
manity for an oppressed and stricken
people who desired only freedom and a
chance to breathe in God's sunlight.
That war was not brought into existence
as a grand crusade of arms."
After discussing at length the result of
the war with Spain, showing how the
Philippines fell Into our hands, he asked
If it was desirable to leave these islands
to float about the Pacific as political dere
licts To do that, he declared. would be
the national crime of the century. Hav
ing accepted those islands we had under
taken also the responsibility for law and
order there. ' '.V ' ... ....
"We will first perform, said he, the
duty of the hour, and there is not a man
who breathes in this chamber to-night
who would be willing to surrender our
flag and position to Aguinaldo and his fol
l0 In er due course of time. Carter believed,
on each of these liberated islands the peo
ple would meet on their national holiday
to celebrate the landing of American
troops which brought them freedom. Car
ter estimated the number of men required
as 30.000 for the Philippines. 12.000 , for
Cuba. 15,000 for coast defenses and Â£000
for duty at the various Indian posts .in
the West This would account., for 82,000
men provided for in the bill, and Carter
minted out that quite one-fifth of the to
?al number of 100.000. according to statis
ts. would be incapacitated for duty -

UTAH'S BRIBERY SCANDAL
TESTIMONY HEARD BY INVES
TIGATING COMMITTEE.
The Accused Senatorial Candidate De
nies That He Offered Money
to Representative
Law.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 25.â The
legislative investigating committee ex
amined a number of witnesses to-day,
I among- whom were S. X. Christensen,
Horn Thatcher, Senator Chambers and
[ A. W, McCune.
Christensen testified that he had
been working in the interest of Mc-
Cune; that he had received for ser
i vices about $10 a week and did not ex
! pect anything further. He said his
| duty was principally to see that all the
McCune members were present at the
I joint Assembly, and to look wise.
Thatcher's testimony related chiefly
to a meeting at his residence between
j Rideout, Stewart and McCune. He
! thought the talk was generally about
| the deadlock, and that it ought to be
broken.
Senator Chambers testified to a con
versation with Jackson, in which the
latter said he would vote for McCune
after he had canceled his obligations
| to other candidates, provided he could
j become convinced that McCune's cam
i paign was honest.
McCune was then called to the wit
! ness stand. He said he had no partic
ular acquaintance with Representative
' Law until Tuesday of last week. Later
I he met Law in a restaurant, invited
! him into a back room and had a con
! versation about a letter written to a
' Bishop in Cache County. The men had
' said this letter would prove that Law
l was elected through church influence
: and if they could prove this to him he
wt uld leave Cannon and vote for Ife
i Cune. Shortly after this he left and
i saw Law no more until the next Fri
day. Law wanted to speak to him over
'â  the telephone. He went to the tele
: phone and Law asked if he could see
him. McCune said he asked Law if he
could come over to headquarters and
Law said:
"No, I am watched; they are suspi
i cious of me. Can't you meet me at the
Wasatcn drugstore? I think I can
: vote for you according to my conver
sation with your men, but I want to
see you personally."
"Moses Thatcher, who was at head
quarters, said to me, inasmuch as Law
had voted for a Democrat he might
: vote for me and I had better see him,"
continued McCune. "I went to the
drugstore and found Law and asked
what he wanted. He said he would
rather go to some private place, and
asked: â¢Can't you go to my room?'
.said: 'No, I anY"tod""busy.' He said: 'I
! think I can vote for you to-day.' He
i hesitated and stammered and said he

"SOLDIERS' BLOOD
IN PHILIPPINES ON
PRESIDENT'S HEAD"
Jerry Simpson of Kansas Among
Representatives Who Lay
the Blame on McKinley.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25.â The House I
continued work on the army appropri
ation bill to-day, but failed to complete
It. Considerable animosity was devel- j
oped during the debate, and there were
sharp passages between Grosvenor and
Cannon on one hand and Simpson of
Kansas and Cochran at Missouri on the
other. In the course of the debate
Cochran (D.) of Missouri attempted to |
secure time to answer the statement
made on the other side yesterday, that
there was nothing in the nature of an
alliance between Aguinaldo and the
American forces before the capture of
Manila.
Hull objected.
"This is not the first time," said
Cochran, "that the majority in the
j closing hours of debate have made
i challenges and then objected to replies.
Their -objections are made to cover
i their retreat."
Hull thereupon withdrew his objec
tion, and Cochran proceeded to give
: what he said was the most important
! chapter of the war. Upon the testi
i mony of three American generals he
contended that, first, we solicited an
alliance; second, that it was solemnly
formed; third, that the Filipinos kept
i their faith, and. fourth, that we shame
i fully violated our compact. He referred
: to the reports of General Anderson,
General Greene and General Merritt to
prove his assertions of the valuable aid
I rendered by Aguinaldo and the insur
i gents.
Cochran also insisted that the money
j said to have been embezzled by Aguin
aldo ($400,000) had been used in the
purchase of arms and in fighting the
Spanish. This, he said, was proven by
| the testimony of Consul Wildman.
Lacey (R.) of lowa denounced the
! other side generally for firing iiUo the
j rear of Otis by sounding the praises of
I Aguinaldo and Agoncillo upon the floor
i of the House.
Grosvenor (R.) of Ohio pursued the
! subject along the same lines. It was
by my men. but he said: I don't think
it's enough.' I asked him what he
meant and he answered that he was a
poor man. and he said: 'I will vote for
you if you will give me $5000.' I simply
said to him: 'I won't do anything of
the kind. I have enough Democratic
votes to win anyway.'
â¢ When I left the store Law was a
short distance away, talking to the man
that has testified here as Bob Fryer.
I started across the street and Law
overtook me and said: 'I think I can
vote for you anyhow.' I told him if he
did so to vote after the roll call. I went
to headquarters and saw a number of
people there. I saw Mr. Dunbar. He
asked, 'Is Law going to vote for you?'
I said. "No. he's a dirty scrub,' or some
thing of that kind."
The committee adjourned to Monday
morning, when McCune will be cross
examined.
Electric Launch Wrecked.
TIBPRON. Feb. 25.â A handsome little
electric launch belonging to Frederick
Spaulding of the Pioneer Carpet Beating
treason now, he said, to stop and hesi
tate as to whether our soldiers should
be defended. He denied that there had
been any alliance with Aguinaldo and
said that at the proper time he would
produce the record. The first order of
the President after the fall of Manila
had forbidden any and all alliances of
any character with any one. He re
ferred to Aguinaldo as a "scalawag."
"I can say what I desire to in two
sentences," said Cannon (R.) of Illinois, _
who then got the floor. "If the speeches
made here yesterday by Simpson and
others had been made yesterday in Ma
nila they would be arrested, tried by
drumhead court-martial and shot. (Re
publican applause and Democratic
jeers.) The United States has and
will continue to exercise sovereignty in
the Philippines. If they are obstructed
the power of the whole people as rep
resented by the army and navy will
see to it that our authority is main
tained, and the rocks and mountains
will fall upon any individual or any
party which seeks to obstruct us."
(Great Republican applause.)
Simpson rose to a question of per
sonal privilege to answer the statement
of Cannon that if he (Simpson) had
made his speech in Manila he would
have been court-martialed and shot.
Perhaps this might be so, said Simpson,
derisively adding: "But to be shot at
Manila is better than to be shot here
by an old muzzle-loading brass can
non."
There was great laughter at Simp
son's pun. He was thankful, he said,
that the time had not come when men
were shot for expressing their views.
He had not, he declared, criticized the
soldiers, for he gloried in their heroism.
But the blood of those brave soldiers
from Kansas and elsewhere who had
fallen in Majiila was on the head of the
President as commander in chief of the
army.
The committee rose at 2 o'clock with
out having completed the army bill and
took up the special order of eulogies to
the late Senator TValthall of Mis
sissippi.
Works broke loose from its moorings yes
terday, and drifting upon the rocks near
Lime Point. was dashed to pieces.
Spaulding and John Xorby, assisted by
members of the lifesavins crew at Lime
Point, removed the boilers of the launch
yesterday, and whatever else was not in
jured beyond repair. The lauch was val
ued at $I*loo. It is not known whether
the mooring line was cut or insecurely
tied.
DAY GETS A PLACE.
WASHINGTON", Feb. 25.â The Presi
dent to-day submitted to the Senate for
confirmation the appointment of ex-
Secretary of State William R. Day as
Judge of the United States Circuit
Court for the Sixth Judicial District.
The nomination is not a surprise, as it
was understood when Mr. Day left the
Cabinet to become a Peace Commis
sioner that he would be provided for
after his Paris labors were ended, as
has now been done. The Sixth Judicial
District in Ohio is a new one and was
created only a short time since, with
his appointment in view.

LONDON, Feb. 25.â The news that
the Khalifa is gathering a host, vary
ing In numbers from 15.000 to 30,000 men,
and Is marching on Khartoum, came
with a rude shock to the people of
Great Britain, who were under the im
pression that he was almost a solitary
wanderer in the desert. Official circles,
however, express satisfaction at the
fact that the Khalifa is apparently de
termined to make another onslaught on
the Anglo-Egyptian forces, as they are
confident he will easily be defeated.
Major i General Sir Archibald Hunter,
the Governor of Omdurman, is o.uoted
as paying in an interview: "1 regard

â  BAKERSFIELD, Feb. 25.â D. Van Wagner, representative of some
| prominent Chicago capitalist? who sent him here to negotiate for the
.;, purchase of the Butte mine at liandsburg, has disappeared. Much
* anxiety Is felt for his welfare.
Van Wagner arrived in town on Wednesday night and, after epend
* ing the evening with friends, announced his intention to "take in the

* in several different places up to 4 o'clock in the morning, from which
time no trace of him can be found. He had but a small amount of
money with him, but wore some valuable jewelry when last seen.
Foul play is suspected, and his friends are getting very anxious.
â  * A reward of. $100 has been offered for information as to his where
* abouts.
British troops have been ordered to get
ready te ret .m to Omdurman from
lower Egypt and a strong expedition
will be formed and advanced to meet
the Khalifa.
<A controversy has been raging this
week over the destruction of the
Mahdi's tomb at Omdurman and the
disposal of his bon^s. It is said that
the officers, after the battle, divided his
bones among themselves, one officer
getting a linger nail, while the em
balmed head was given to the late Gen-
eral linrdnn's nephew.
The liadical newspapers indignantly
condemn the outrage, which is defend
ed on the other side on the ground of.
expediency, it being held that the de
struction of the Mahdfs remains was
a. great blow to fanaticism. The Irish
members heckled the Government on
the subject and drew forth a statement
to the effect that the Ministers had no

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Biliousness, dyspepsia, loss of appetite,
disturbed s>eep. nervousness, headache,
giddiness and drowsiness, wind and pain
or fullness of the stomach after meals, cold
chills and flushings of heat, shortness of
breath â these are the blank cheques of
physical bankruptcy. Take them to a
physician and he-will fill them up with the
name of some more or less serious disease.
Every time that you carry one of them to
him "you draw out some of your funds in
the Bank of Health. Keep it up, and there
will soon be no funds in the treasury.
The man who suffers from these dis-
orders and neglects them will Â«oon be in
the relentless grasp of some fatal disease.
If he is naturally narrov/ chested and shal-
low lunged, it will probably be consump-
tion ; if his father or mother died of par-
alysis or some nervous trouble, it will
probably be nervous exhaustion or prostra-
tion, or even insanity ; if there is a taint in
the family blood, it will be blood or skin
disease; if he lives in a new or alow,
swampy country, it will be malaria; if he
lives a life of exposure, it may be rheu-
matism. There is just one safe course for
a man to follow who finds himself out of
sorts and suffering from the symptoms
described. It is to resort to Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery. This medicine
makes the appetite keen, corrects all dis-
orders of the digestion, renders assimila-
tion perfect, invigorates the liver, purifies
and enriches the blood and builds firm,
healthy flesh and nerve tissue. It cures
almost all diseases that result from insuf-
ficient^ 01 improper nourishment of the
brain and nerves. Bronchial, throat, and
even lung affections, when not too far ad-
vanced, readily yield to it.
"I took Dr. Piece's Golden Medical Discovery
for Eczema " writes J. W. Barnhart, of No 446
Df Witt Street, Buffalo, N. V., "and it com-
pletely cured me."
NEW HOME FOR THE MARIN
COUNTY BANK AT SAN RAFAEL
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 24.â The contract to build the new Marin County Bank has been awarded to Thomas
O'Connor, the well-known local contractor, and active work toward its construction has now begun. The old building
on the corner of A and Fourth streets has been removed and a substantial brick foundation is being laid. It is
thought the structure will be ready for occupancy in about sixty days.
The bank will be modeled in brick, after the old style Spanish architecture, on the plans of Newsnn & Meyer,
and will be one story in height, with a tile roof. It will extend fifty feet on A street and twenty-five on Fourth. The
interior will be finished in natural wood.
A modern feature of the bank will be a huge steel vault, which will be utilized not only as a safe for money, but
as a safe deposit in which patrons may place their money and valuables and leave them as secure as in a metropolitan
institution.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â Theadjourned
meeting of the Intercollegiate Associa
tion of Amateur Athletes of America
was held to-day at the Fifth-Avenue
Hotel, and some very important
changes in the constitution and rules
in relation to amateurism and scholar
ship of men competing in intercollegiate
contests were made. The constitution
was changed so as to forbid a man who
has for any reason left his class stand
ing to compete in intercollegiate sports.
Another sweeping change was the di
vorcing of bicycling from the track con
tests and the formation of a separate
association for controlling intercol
legiate bicycle racing.
The following compromise amend
ment to the rules agreed to by the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania was adopted:
A student 9hall be allowed to compete
at the Intercollegiate meeting four times
and no more. This applies to all depart
mentsâmedical, school, law school, acad
t-my, etc. If a student has represented a
college in any intercollegiate track meet
ing in which more than three colleges
participated and has won a first or second
place In any event he shall not be eligible
to represent any other college he may
hereafter attend in the intercollegiate
meeting until he has attended such col
lege two full calendar years.
ThiP amendment is not to be retro
active, but affecting only those who
enter college after the date of the
adoption of the amendment.
The proposition to bar for a year a
man ocming from a preparatory school
who has won a place in an intercol
legiate or open meet was modified so
as not to bar the interscholastic winr
ners, but only those who have taken
part in outside athletic contests and
won honors so as to make them desir
able acquisitions to the college athletic
managers.
Boston University, Brown University,
lowa State University. Leland Stan
ford Jr., Michigran, Pennsylvania State
College, Wesley an I'niversity and Uni
versity of Wisconsin were expelled
from the association on account of non
payment of dues.
The intercollegiate bicycle associa
tion was formed after the adjournment
of the meeting of the athletic associa
tion. H. N. Hall was elected president.

LONDON, Feb. 25.â The adjournment
of the Anglo-American Commission at
Washington has caused a feeling of
deep regret here and th^ optimistic tone
I of the British Foreign Office's explana
| tion is not reflected by the general pub
| lie, although the newspapers, as a rule,
profess to hope that the fresh att'-mut
to reach an agreement in the autumn
wHI prove more succesful.
The Speaker remarks:
"The fact that business arrangements
in particular points affecting large in
vested interests in both countries can
not be satisfactorily reached un
apreciably affects the friendship of
the nations as a whole. The nations
are still aggregates and not persons."
The Spectator says: "Arbitration
seems to be a difficult mode of settlinK
international disputes. The profession
al diplomats have a right to chuckle a
j little."
I The St. James Gazette, in the course
of a long article on "America's refusal
to accept an umpire," headed "The
inconsistency of the United States."
contends that America now refuses
what she agreed to in the case of the
Venezuelan arbitration, when King Os
car was empowered to appoint an um
pire, and says: "The English commis
sioners in the present case, therefore,
have not made a proposal unfajnil'.ar
to the United States, yet they meet
with a refusal. Under these circum
stances we are compelled to ask what
the United States really want. They
know an umpire is necessary, let them
then choose a man from the acceptable
candidates after discussion with our
selves. Unless they make some such
proposal or offer a satisfactory settle
ment on the boundary line, we shall be
compelled to suspect either insincerity
of their friendship and gratitude at
Great Britain's recent diplomatic as
sistance, or their willingness to abide,
in a doubtful case, by the principle of
arbitration, whereof they are the fore
most champions and greatest benefi
ciaries in the past."
The events at Manila have been fol
lowed here with interest and there has
been general condemnation of the Fili
pinos' attempt to burn the town.

The London municipalities bill, intro
duced in the House of Commons on
February 23, by Arthur J. Balfour. has
been well received generally. The most
striking feature of the bill is the re
vival of the ancient city of Westmin
ster, which will comprise the whole of
the enormously valuable and busy area
from Temple Bar to Knightsbridge and
from Oxford street to the River
Thames, in which are included nearly
all the theaters, clubs, government of
fices, parks, royal pajaces, embassies,
etc., and the aristocratic districts of
Belgravla and Mayfair. It will be five
times the size of the city of London
proper, with five times its population,
and it will be a serious rival of the
ancient city of London, whose ratable
value is Â£4.450,000, while that of the
city of Westminster is Â£4,850.000. The
imperial and social importance of the
new city will be tremendous.
Lord James of Hereford has
introduced a bill in opposition
to the Government bill in ' the
House of Lords as to the out
come of the recommendations '^f the
committee who recently investigated
the usury systems. The bill provides
that every money lender must be regis
tered and must do business solely in his
own nam*. In cases where the Inter
est exceeds 10 per cent, or when the in
cidental charges are excessive, the
courts may reopen the transaction and
give judgment in accordance with all
the risks and circumstances of the case.
The lenders as well as the borrowers
are held accountable for false state
ments, promises and deceptive words
employed when the contract Is made.
JESSE JAMES IDENTIFIED
AS ONE OF THE ROBBERS

in Ooiart.
KANSAS CITY, Feb. 25.â The most positive identification of Jesse
James as one of the Leeds train robbers was made in the courtroom to
day by William J. Smith of Stokesberry, Mo., who was a passenger on
the Missouri Pacific train the night it was held up. Smith testified that
he got out when the train stopped and walked up among the robbers,
one of whom placed a revolver against his breast and ordered him back
into the car.
"Did that man. have anything over his face?"
"He had nothing over his face. He had something black around
his neck, as if it were a mask, slipped down."
"How light was it?"
"It was very light. The light streamed out the mail car door."
"Did you get a good look at that man?"
"Yes, sir."
"Do you see that man in the courtroom?"
IVfr. Sirfifh pointed at Jesse James, sitting facing him, and said:
"Yes, sir; there he sits, right over there?"
"You mean the defendant, Jesse James?"
"Yes, gir, I mean Jesse James."
Unusual interest in the trial proceedings is being shown and specta
tors daily crowd every inch of space in the courtroom. Several 'wit
nesses who testified during the day corroborated the salient points of
Informer Lowe's evidence of yesterday implicating James. It was shown
also that James had been intimate previous to the robbery with Lowe,
Andy Ryan, a brother of the notorious "Bill" Ryan, and John Kennedy,
all of whom have been connected with train robberies in the vicinity of
Kansas City.

JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 16, via steamer
Farallon to Port Townaend, Feb. 25.â Jay
Decker, a Juneau merchant, returned last
night from the Porcupine country. He
reports a steadily increasing rush there.
Within a day, while coming out, he met
seventy-five men and outfits going in on
the trail. The number runs from fifty to
one hundred to a day. They are flocking
to Porcupine in increasing numbers from
Juneau, Skaguay and nearly every camp
in Southeastern Alaska.
Few dog teams are seen on the Porcu
pine trail. Nearly every mother's son in
perspiring at the end of a rope ahead ol
his own sled. This is due principally to
the comparatively short distance (from
forty to sixty miles* from salt water to
the creeks. It is too expensive to buy
dogs and too much bother with them for
so short a distance.
Mr. Decker describes the trail as in fine
condition. He has confidence that there
will be a booming mining camp some
where in the Porcupine region.
There are many reports of new strikes
in the Porcupine country, but Mr. Decker
says he heard of none while on the trail.
He went into a section of country a con
siderable distance from Porcupine Creek,
and In a different direction, and left two
men in there.
Haines Mission has changed from a
quiet missionary post to a comparatively
bustling camp, dotted with tents and ani

By HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Feb. 22 (by steam
ship Cottage City to Victoria, Feb. 25.)
âCanadian jealousy of Americans is
becoming more bitter at Atlin since the
exclusion law passed. Where before the
animosity was hidden, it ; is now crop
ping out on the surface in more than
one way. The Canadians seem to fear
the shrewdness and swift action of the
Americans, and in order to defeat them
have secretly banded together and
signed a paper committing the signers
to fight for their rights if necessary.
A petition has been secretly circulated
pledging the signers to resist by force
of arms, if necessary, any attempt on
the part of Americans to locate town
lots in Atlin City and mining claims in
the district at large. The paper has
been signed to date by between sixty
and seventy Canadians, a few English-
men and also a few Americans. The
original paper was recently in the
hands of Deputy Recorder McVicars,
and may by this time be in the hands
of Gold Commissioner Graham. The
facts leaked out through a man who
refused to sign the paper. Nobody
seems to know what brought about the
circulation of such a paper, as so far
as known the Americans have not con
templated "taking the bull by the
horns" and running the camp.
This information comes from J. R.
McGowan, a British subject, who claims
to hail from San Francisco. No open
rebellion against the exclusion act by
Americans is feared. If Americans are
exercising their wits in any direction
against the law it is to outwit and
straddle it and not to defy it. A large
force of Government surveyors is at
work at.Atlin.
About as good a way as any. to get
the truth and the facts about a mining
camp â and I never send anything else
if I know it â is to read private letters
passing between miners. Two letters
from Dawson received here to-night
have been kindly turned over to me.
Both show that Dawson is not the camp
it used to be. Mike Donahue writes
under date of January 20:
Times are very dull in Dawson at pres
ent â no money in circulation, lots of idle
men and a whole lot of men working lays
that won't amount to anything, especially
on the benches. Grub is plenty- and prices
are going down. Beef has dropped to 25
cents a pound. Some parties tried to cor
ner butter and sugar, but didn't make it
stick.
Frank Schaeffer, writing under date
of February 1, says:
Tour letter dated May lfi just received.
We had the first mail from the outside
this winter on January 24, and very little
of that. The creeks are turning out con
siderable this winter, but I think the
benches will show the largest output.
There are a lot of lay men not doing very
wellâ just trying to take out enough to
take them home. A great many are giv
ing up lays and starting out over the ice.
There are" too many men for the diggings.
Some of the claims are paying 60 cents an
hour and a very few $1. Everything is
overdone here. Meals were SI 50 last fall
a while, and now there are four ,">O-cent
restaurants.- There is lots of grub. Sugar,
butter and milk are scarce; milk $1 a can,
sugar 60 and 7a cents, and butter $1 25 to
$1 50 a pound. Coal oil is down to $1 30
a case. Hardware is still high, but will
tumble before spring. Two variety shows
are running. About half the saloons are
running 25-cent drinks awl cigars and
they do the business. The town is dead
compared with what it used to be.
Southeastern Alaska is undergoing a
cold snap. It has not reached zero at
Juneau, but it has been from 9 to 12
below at Skaguay.

SAN JOSE, Feb. 25.â The board of di
rectors of the defunct Union Savings
Bank must resign at once or be ousted.
The stockholders of the bank have de
cided on this, and to-day they informed
the directors of the fact. Under no cir
cumstances will they allow the men
who wrecked the bank to close up its
affairs.
The stockholders held a businesslike
meeting in Hale's Hall this afternoon.
A resolution was adopted calling on the
directors to resign forthwith, and a
committee was appointed to see that
this was carried out. James W. Rea,
J. Leiter, F. K. Ledyard and A. Barker
went before the directors and asked for
an immediate answer in regard to re
signing.
The directors, then in session, de
clined to answer either in the affirma
tive or the negative. The committee
reported back. Another resolution was
immediately adopted authorizing that
immediate steps be taken to remove the
directors both by law and by the stock
holders. This probably will be done
right away through a petition to be
filed in Judge Lorigan's court, setting
forth their incompetency, and to make
doubly sure of their removal, stock
holders will on March 11 proceed to
elect a new board.
The published statement by Presi
dent W. H. Wright of the bank in. local
papers that depositors would be paid
dollar for dollar was discussed. Little
credence was placed in the statement
and the stockholders regard it as mere-
ly a play to stall off action.
The stockholders are determined to
fight all assessments until the assets
of the bank shall have been exhausted
in paying depositors. Then they are
â¢willing to stand their pro rata. They
want the people to understand they are
not to blame for the failure and were
imposed upon as much as were the
depositors.
It waa freely expressed that the di
rectors were not fit persons to close the
bank's business, and in the interests
of the depositors and the stockholders
they must retire. The new directors
elected by the old board in place of
those who have lately resigned, will
not be accepted.
At a meeting of the directors of the
Union Savings Bank this afternoon
Thomas E. Johnson tendered his resig
nation as director, and Charles P. Bras
lan was elected in his place. Braslan
represent? San Francisco depositors.
Director John McMahon also resigned.
This vacancy was not filled, as it is
proposed to choos* some She accept
able to the depositors. Howard's in
debtedness was discussed, and Attor
ney N. Bowden was instructed to take
steps to protect the banks interest..

â  BERUDT, Feb. 25.â United States
Ambassador White has had several
â¢protracted conferences this week, with
â¢Barc-n vcn Richtofen, Under Secretary
â¢ of the. Foreign Office, on the subject
â¢ of the recent troubles in Samoa, and
. baa received a number of documents
in support of Germany's view of th*
.situation.' The interviews were of the
. cost, friendly character.
An official, is behalf of Baron yon
. Bulott, the German Minister of For
.-eign Affairs, says that the German En
; bassadcr at Washington, Dr. yon Hol
-. leben, has represented to the United
â¢ States, informally and in a friendly
â â¢ manner, the advisability of recalling
â¢â â William Chambers, the Chief Justice of
â¢Samoa. The German Government is of
'; -the opinion that Mr. Chambers, since
the pnWTdktion of the letter to his
. brother, which appeared in the news
. papers of the United States, is an "im
. proper person to represent the three
â  governments of Samoa."
â¢ It is further said that he wa3 put
.- 'there in order to represent the protect
. !hg powers, and far him to criticize one
..' of these powers "makes him manifestly
.";â¢ unfit to serve any longer in his pres-
Jent capacity." It is only necessary. It
\is pointed it, to reverse the case in
â¢ order to show this strikingly to Ameri
: t cans.
". -**l.et us sup Dose," said the German
cScial referring to the above, "that
".'such a letter had been "written by Herr
Hose, the German Consul at Apia,
â¢â¢Â»:ould not the entire American press
.point out that it was flagrant proof of
H~rr Rose's unfitness to any longer
hold his place?"
â Mr Chambers' letter has greatly
'. stirred up public feeling in Germany
- and nearly the entire press asserts that,
by the letter, ilr. Chambers has "giar
. tagfy manifested his unfitness for his
position."
Some of the papers declare that in
asmuch as Germany, the United States
â¢ and Great Britain have declared their
â  intention to maintain the basis of
Samoa intact, while Mr. Chambers, by
his acts and words, has put himself
..outside the act, and can no longer be
considered a proper mandatory of the
signatory powers.
XhÂ«Â±-iaeat Icapeetiait hill .Is acconi-
pani<sd b-jr a long memorial expiainixis'
- the reasons aruidiiig the G<jveminent in
â¢ the matter. It gives details showingr
â¢ that the fears expressed that a general
inspection would make meat more ex
â¢ pecsive are unfounded, the cost of such
â¢inspection feeing only one-eisnth or
â¢ one-sixth of one cent per kilo in the
j .' densely populated' districts. It is also
â¢."set forth that the importation of meat
not be rendered more difficult. a_3
.. : - the importers will easily accommodate
â â¢. .'themselves to the new provisions.
;-. The Agrarians do not like the bilL
â  â  They assert that the paragraph provid
â¢ '.ihg for reimbursing by the Govenmsnt
--.. '.of the losses to producers through their
â¢ â¢â  having' their cattle or meat condemned
â ' .'.as unnt for food cannot be thought of,
' '. " and they add that cattle insurance is
-. ".the only remedy for these producers.
â  â¢â¢' The Tage Zeitung attacks the bill
â  . venomously, declaring that it is wholly
â¢iptable. and that it contains un
. justifiable benefits to foreign importers.
'â¢ The paper says in conclusion: "For us
'â¢the bill will only be acceptable if ail
â  the provisions relating to foreign meats
.are. replaced by one paragraph, saying
that all the provisions of this law ap
â¢ Â£fy -with equal force to all im
ported meats. Unless this Is inserted
we hope the bill will be rejected."
â¢ : A careful reading of the whole bill
demonstrates that the fears entertained
â¢that it will render the importation of
, .American meats more difficult are in
] no way borne out by the- facts. An
American, expert now in Berlin said:
"There is every reason to hope that
.the bill, if it becomes a law, will ma
terially aid our meat exports to Gar
. many, It is more favorable to Ameri
can meat interests than we have the
right to expect- The great feature we
â¢have contended for, a single inspection
on a uniform plan, is conceded out
â¢ right. The other features are of still
greater advantage to us, especially the
â¢ cne empowering the Bundesrath to
."jrant easements eriichterungen, in the
Importation, of meats, which experience
'has shown, by virtue of their methods
of production and preparation are not
dangerous to life or health and to omit
. a previous inspection altogether. I7n
-der this provision the United States can
claim unrestricted admission of all
American sausage and pick. cured
cr salt meats of every description, for
It can be shown that there is not a sin-
. hinosis or other disease
:.-. meats. This will put
this class of American meats on quite
-. -a different footing than it has held :
heretofore. I regard this provision as i
being one of the utmost advantage."'
..â¢ Professor Stiles has sent a detailed
â¢ statement regarding the bill to Wash- \
.ington and "it i 3 understood that his i
.'conclusions tally with, the foregoing
views of the expert.
â  The Butchers' Federation joins with '
. â¢ tfce Agrarians in opposing the bill and
has issued a circular asking for an
â¢ agitation fund to aid . the Agrarians.
,The federation insists that the bill
â¢should contain a provision for the
double inspection of all foreign meats. .
The Vossische Cone says the fed
eration thus places itself in opposition ;
. to the interests of German meat con
'â¢ sumers, in rendering imports more dif
ficult and raising prices..
' A number of Saxon manufacturers
have petitioned the Saxon and imperial i
Governments, complaining that many
â  Americans visit the German textile and
other factories, spying upon their
.methods and inducing employes to be
' tray the trade secrets and emigrate to I
â¢ the United States. They ask the an- :
' thorities to interfere.
There were spirited debates in the
Reichstag and Prussian Diet this week.
In the former the Socialists, criticiz
ing the severe sentences imposed on
Socialist rioters by a Dresden court,
caused violent scenes. Herr Gradnacsr,
. a Socialist, termed the sentences bru
. tally tyrannical. :-: - Reuger, the rep
âº resentative of Saxony, took exception
to this, calling it an abuse of free
speech and appealing to the president
for protection, at which the Leftists l
hnoted.

BORE THE INSULTS
BUT FELT STINGS
Caprivi's Letters Show
His Sentiment.
Capyrtshteti 1399, by the Associated PrÂ«a.
i BERLIN, Feb. 25.â A further batch of
] letters written by the late General
Co cut yon. Caprtvi has been published.
They clearly show the patience with
which Caprivi bore all the insults and
attacks of his foes, but they also show
how he felt their stingy. In one. reply
ing to a correspondent who wished to
see his honor vindicated, Caprivi said:
"I must decline to comply with your
wish, and give you the motives which
guided me. Not an inconsiderable part
of my motives concern Prince Bis
marck, and I may say. with all due
recognition of the brilliancy of his per
son and our great times, that I saw.
even before I became Chancellor, what
a great drawback the reverse of that
medal showed. Prince Bismarck, as
has often been stated, managed his j
home policy by the same means he em- j
ployed in foreign politics. Thus the na
tion was in danger of seeing its moral
standard lowered. But I do not think
It right to enter into more details or
particulars about this -now/*. â *
A few other lines in the letter ex
THE E3IPOBIT/M.
pressed the melancholy which Caprivi
felt after his resignation. He said:
"It is hard to be obliged in one's work
to dispense with the acquiescence of
those for whom one elects, and it is
still harder in old age to be separated
from circles in which one has
through a long life. But the hardest of
all is to be exposed with tied hands to
public disregard and be obiiged to look
on and see what one believe! one had
created for the good of the state demol
ished again. I had to abandon many
dear relations in order to remain faith
ful to my convictions. I could not fore
see this. I remained faithful to my
King and myself. This belief nobody
can take from me. As for the rest, peo
ple may think and say what they like."'

SONQRA, Feb. 23.â The greatest
demonstration held in Sonora in years
took place, this evening', the occasion
being the arrival of the first passen
ger train over the Sierra Railway. The
Columbia cornet band was at the depot
at 5 o'clock, and 300* people were pres

town arrived with 200 visitors. "When
the train stopped seventy-five giant
powder cartridges were exploded. At
3:i3 the first regular passenger train ar
rived. George W. Wright^ the popular
engineer of the road, who has the
honor of having been born In Sonora,
brought the first train I rnto . the . city.
The surrounding hills fairly shook
from the effect of the firing of hundreds
of giant cartridges. ...
After music by the band. C. H. : Bur

THE PRESS NOT TO BLAME.
Nj O doubt there is felt a hope that Burns may
benefit bj a'reaction against the press which
1 â  poses him. But, speaking of reactions, there
art others. Hie attitude of the press has simply
represented the instant public reaction against Burns
et in the moment bis candidacy was announced
bj the Southern Pacific road. That candidacy has
lost none of ii I ive elements and has gained
. nsive since that time. It is now
just what it was thenâ..: to the State and an
Republican party. It its success were
possible, the mortal wound inflicted upon the. party
would be the same now as it would have been if
deal; upon the first ballot Nothing said nor omitted
ged 1 mtion nor taken the
a out oi the poison of the Burns movement. The
[act thai Wright availed himself oi a passing sensa
tion in the House against newspapers to attach hiin
to the incident as a martyr has effected no
change in his situation nor made any one forget that
he held the Speakership seventeen days and resigned
it in disgrace to avoid expulsion from his seat.
So, m like manner, the morals and politics of the
torial issue and all that is impinged upon it are
re before their n in the press j
ked retaliation in which men participated who
at heart are in exact accord with the press as to the
a -is which made that discussion accessary.

which appear from th- int of the journalist.
When the cause of an unjustifiable ambition seeks
ncement by enlisting among its agencies every
. from the wanton to the bottle, and. moving
bribery, temptation and debauch
ery, seeks over ihe ruined honor of nidi
's the tarnished fame of the State and the de
feat of the party, there anscs quite naturally a spirit
of frank remark which is not agreeable to the push
and pull that is before ami behind Mr. Burns.
If natural md party interest had been loy

man their peer in service and their equal in fitness

old "trick of the sinister politician to barnacle himself
the party to its harm and complain that those who
.I'a^e and denounce him are enemies of the party.
The enemies oi the party are those who abuse its
. who belong to it for what they can get from
it, and not for what good it can do the State.
. rty arc those who keep its word

ple, who trust it for its promises.
We belong to the latter class, and. not denying

THE INTERESTS OF REPUBLICANISM.
THE few manipulators and selfish farmers of the
opportunities of Republican power are trying to
secure their own ends, to the destruction of
party primacy, by declaring that The Call, under ad
verse party management; reflects the aspirations of
the minority in this State tind seeks to advance its
interests by fighting against Burns.
This statement should appeal to no man of con
science and sense, and to no Republican who con
siders at once the principles and the mission of the
party. It is a statement which carries with it the
necessary admission that Daniel M. Burns is the
most meritorious and deserving Republican in this
State, and that he is so much the party that to op
pose him is to oppose the party itself.
Now, in all candor, we ask any one who stands for
this statement to answer what would have been the
result if this preposterous claim had been made be
fore the last election? What would have happened if
the Republican State Convention had announced
Burns as the party's sole candidate for Senator?
What would have happened if the candidates, from
Governor down, who did such useful work on the
stump, had announced in every meeting that Mr.
Burns was to go to the Senate as the first and high
est fruit of Republican victory? What would have
happened if the Democratic manager of Republican
politics for the Southern Pacific had proclaimed be
fore election that Mr. Burns was the Republican can
didate of that corporation for the Senatorship?
We ask any thoughtful Republican, who knows
why he is a Republican, to appear before himself in
the court of his own conscience and ask which Â«has
stood for the highest, best and most permanent in
terests of his party, the Southern Pacific road in
backing Bums or The Call in opposing him. There
is not one such Republican in California who does
not know in his heart that the success of Burns
means the defeat of the party.
We have seen much bad-tempered criticism of The
Call, and some antagonisms have arisen which we
will long regret, but. brought to the test of party
loyalty, measured by the things which make for im
mediate and future Republican domination in this
State. We as yet lack the condemnation of a single
Republican who looks to a future indorsement of the
current party action.
The Call stands in a position peculiarly marked by
unselfishness and by a desire for continued Repub
lican primacy, for it has no candidate for the Senate,
it represents no personal greeds, grudges nor am
bitions, and stands in good company, as it would
elect to stand in no companionship at all.
for the party which received such a generous mea
sure of public confidence last November, and in all
fairness and decency should deserve that trust and
merit its repetition by having aspirations above the
gutter, candidates outside the logues' gallery, and |
purposes higher than the ambitions of the vulgar and
indecent.
" This is a position which we prefer to hold, sub
mitting our course to the calm judgment of those to
whom politics represents principles rather than
spoils.
The traffic -hunting pigs who want to swallow what
they can root out of party victory have sent abroad
the charge that The Call is intriguing to secure the
return of Stephen M. 'White to the Senate. Against
this falsehood we set the truth that it is our desire
to have the Republican party prove that it has in its
ranks a man to succeed that Senator who will be his
peer, that it may not be said that in electing a suc
cessor to him California Republicanism has only per
petuated the vacancy left by his retirement.
If there is a Republican who deserves public re
spect in this State who is in discord and disagree
ment with our position he has not yet been heard
from.
(\ NEW DEPARTURE IN POLITICS.
r EARFUL, perhaps, that the demoralization of
Democracy and the collapse of Populism may
leave the Republican party without a rival in
iooo and thus deprive the country of its accustomed
heated Presidential campaign, some enterprising citi
zens of Washington have set about the task of or
ganizing a new party to overthrow the administration
?rid reform the country.
The movers in the new undertaking propose to
base their organization upon a platform with but a
single plank. That plank, however, is of the kind
known as a jim dandy. It is about as wide as the
desire for office and as thick as a log. It is clearly
strong enough to support as many people as can get
en it with both feet, and the calculations are that
enough shall get on it to elect a President by carry
ing every State in the Union.
This single, all-comprehending, high-cockolorum
plank declares: "We hold niat the only free and just
government is that in which the lawmaking bodies
are composed of direct representatives from such in
dustries or occupations as have a majority of votes
in the Congressional and Legislative districts denned
by our constitutions and the laws of our States. With
an abiding faith in the truth and justice of our be
lief, we appeal to every farmer in the United States
to join hands with us in effecting our purpose, which
is the nomination and election of farmers as members
of Congress and farmers as members of our Legis
latures."
For simplicity of character and directness of ex
pression that platform is Unsurpassed in the annals of
cur politics. It ignores all questions of govern
mental policy, all consideration of political measures,
and goes straight to the main pomt â who shall hold
the offices. We declare, say the framcrs of the plat
fo-m. that the farmers should be the lawmakers and
draw the salaries and divide the patronage. What
more would you have?
If the new movemer.t do not attain a wide sweep
and swing it will be only because this country is
tired of politics and would not vote for the ten com
mandments if accompanied by a new agitation. The
platform gets rid of the tariff, the silver question, the
var problems and all other issues that perplex the
. brain. The sole defect in it is that it also gets rid of
all the existing politicians, and that defect is one
>d many people v. it! account a virtue.
The latest attempt to overthrow the French Gov
ernment hnd in it many of the elements of a practical
joke, including the discomfiture of the jokers.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26. 1899.
THE so-called anti-cartoon bill provides that it
shall be "unlawful"' to reproduce in a news
paper the portrait of any person residing in
this State without his or her consent, except such
person is a public official or has been convicted of a
crime. It also provides that it shall be '"unlawful" to,
draw and publish a caricature of any person which re
flects upon his honor or integrity, or which (it might
have been more aptly said) is calculated to lacerate
his feelings. To do either one of these "unlawful"
acts makes not only the man who draws the carica
ture or prints the portrait responsible, but every one
connected with his establishment from the printer's
devil up.
The constitution of the State of California contains
an article entitled "Declaration of Rights," by which
certain privileges and immunities are guaranteed to
every citizen. This "declaration" contains some
privileges which the English Barons extorted from
King John at Runnymede. One of its sections de
clares: "Every citizen may freely speak, write and
publish his sentiments on all subjects, being respon
sible for the abuse of that right, and no law shall
be passed to restrain or abridge the liberty of speech
or of the press."
Perhaps the Senators and Assemblymen who voted
for this anti-cartoon bill never heard of the constitu- '
tion of California, or, if they did, were unaware of
the existence in it of this declaration. Indeed, it is
charitable to believe in their ignorance.* How any in
telligent man could read the sentence we have
quoted and vote for the anti-cartoon bill without
considering it a joke passes all comprehension. By
this "declaration" an unalienable right is granted to
every man in California to write and publish his sen
timents upon any subject. Yet the author of the anti
cartoon bill says it shall be "unlawful" to write and
publish them unless it is done in a certain specified
way. which he describes in detail.
Of course a knowledge of constitutional law is not
a qualification for a seat in the Assembly, but, never
theless, when a person having a grievance against
the press attempts to legislate for its regulation he
should take pains to inject some intelligence into his
work. There is no power in the Legislature to regu
late the privilege enjoyed by every man in this State
of speaking and writing his sentiments upon any sub
ject. The Legislature may punish speakers and
writers for abusing the privilege, but it cannot punish
them for telling the truth nor for publishing charges
against their fellow-citizens when they do it for good
motives and justifiable ends.
We venture to say that there is not a Justices' Court
in California which would hold the anti-cartoon bill
constitutional.
A COSE OF TRUE ELOQOENCE.
SINCE the object of oratory is to persuade and
convince the minds of men to such an extent
that they will vote as the orator desires, any
speech which is successful in winning over an
audience prejudiced against the cause of the speaker
must be accounted as one of genuine eloquence.
That being so, the crown for eloquence at this ses
sion of Congress must be awarded to a new member,
a certain William Harrison Graham, described by
the veracious chronicler of the Washington Post as
"the lank, hollow-eyed, bewhiskcred successor to
Governor Bill Stone of Pennsylvania."'
Mr. Graham desired to induce the House to amend
the river a.nd harbor bill by adding to.it an appro
priation for a survey of Yougiiiogrreny Creek, a
'< stream which is tributary to the Monongahela, and
tutors it somewhere in the neighborhood of Fitts
lÂ«irg. As the extent of the desired survey is only
twenty miles, there is no apparent reason why the
work should not be done by the county through
which it runs, and the House took that view of the
question. Moreover, the temper of Speaker Reed is
known to be economical, and the committee in charge
of the bill shared his desire to shut out amendments.
It was therefore a prejudiced, adverse and hostile
audience that Mr. Graham had to address, and had it
not been his maiden effort he would not have been
! listened to at all.
Under such circumstances true genius displays its
potent power. The speaker said nothing about the
insignificant creek for which he sought an appro
; priation. He took up a subject on which he could
spread the eagle. He declared the object of the bill
was to benefit Pittsburg, and then he soared:
"Pittsburg ran present annually to every man,
woman and child in this country a glass bottle.
(Laughter.) Pittsburg: leaves them to decide
whether it shall be filled with milk or something
stronger. (Laughter.) Pitt<=burg makes enough of
both beer and whisky to fill all the 20,000,000 glass
tumblers she sends out annually, her most recent
product being a $25,000,000 beer syndicate. To pro
vide for other cravings of the stomach she has a firm
that sends out pickles enough to present every hu
man being on the face of the earth with one.
(Laughter.) Her railroad tonnage is three times
that of Xew York or Chicago, twice that of London
and four times that of Paris. (Applause.) Includ
ing the Connelsville coke region, over 2,000,000 rail
road cars are loaded annually.
â¢What town is that?" asked Representative
Brucker of Michigan, facetiously.
"It needs no gentleman on the floor of the
House," retorted the eulogizer of Pittsburg, "to an
swer that question." (Laughter and applause.)
The orator had but five minutes in which to make
his speech and sweep the House off its feet. We are
told that after he had given four minutes to a
panegyric on Pittsburg he threw in a few words for
Allegheny County, and then the chairman put the
vote on his amendment. A division was demanded,
and Representative Graham swung both his long,
bony arms. ''Friends of Allegheny County stand !
up," he shouted, as though he were rallying a throng !
j of. freemen at a ward meeting. The whole House
': stood up, or nearly so, for by 106 to I it was decided
that Youghiogheny Creek should be surveyed.
A professional bicycle rider who has been in tlje
business six years says he has pulled down between
$So.ooo and $90,000. Here is encouragement for

aspire to the presidency of a college.
This town wants the horse cars abolished. To be
sure at every proposed improvement there is an out
cry against increased danger, but the populace has
grown agile with practice, and. besides, all cars, of
course, are to be equipped with fenders.

UNCONSTITUTIONAL.
WITH ENTIRE FRANKNESS.
By K|ENF?Y JAMES.
Concerning a new paper which comes
under my notice I have nothing to say
save- as to a single article which hap
pens to be an attack upon Ambrose
Bierce. I have been led to believe that
Mr. Bierce is competent to fight his own
battles and ordinarily would have no
impulse to defend him. So far as the
assault bears upon the ability of Bierce
as a critic I regard it as perfectly just.
His expressed opinion of the literary
product of any person is absolutely
without value. Whether he Is incom
petent to judge or for mere perverse
ness chooses to be absurd is a point
upon which information is difficult to
obtain. But the article in question is
grossly stupid in that it denies to Bierce
credit for capacity to do good work,
when as a fact many intelligent people
here and abroad hold that he is the
writer of some of the best, the strong
est and the most striking stories ever
couched in model English. Certainly
these tales will be remembered long
after the circumstance that Bierce ever
wrote for a daily paper shall have been
forgotten. Whether his Sunday letter
is good or bad matters little, for in a
week â as all other work of the kind â
it is lost to recollection. To formulate
classics for a daily paper would be an
exaggerated method of wasting pearls.
The average reader does not want clas
sics, and getting them would consider
himself aggrieved. Were Bierce to write
at his best he would shoot ideas so far
above the heads of his following that
they could not discern them with a
telescopic mental eye. But my indig
nation is due to the embodying in the
denunciatory screed of a brutal and
malign attack directed against a man
who, having been befriended and en
couraged by Bierce, presumes to ad
mire and perhaps unconsciously to imi
tate him. To this man nature has given
a physical cross to bear and bravely
he bears it. Yet the ambushed assail
ant taunts him with the misfortune not
to be escaped, gibes at the anguish
above which the sufferer has risen, and
then seems to think a point has been
scored. In all my experience as a
reader I never ran across an outrage
more fla ;rant, a covert thrust more
cowardly given. As a smaller reason
for protest there appear to indicate au
thorship of the unholy affront to
decency the i: itials "H. J." Lest some
superficial student of current journal
ism ma> think I am guilty I hasten to
disavow the iniquity. Occasionally the
duty of saying harsh things arises, and
while I do not shirk it I do not hide
behind initials. Such subterfuge is
worse than the crime of being anony
mous, for it may cast suspicion upon
the guiltless. Before I reach so de
graded a state as to devote to wanton
ridicule of the afflicted such feeble habit
of phrase as may be mine may 1 lose
the power to place a word on record.

That James Creelman should now be
near the scene of activities in Manila
is a genuine misfortune.. Of all the
newspaper correspondents who ever
misled the public. I regard him as the
most conscienceless and unreliable.
One might read a detailed account of
a battle, written by Creelman, a de
scription of the charge, the retreat and
the burial of the dead, and yet not
have the slightest assurance that a bat
tle had occurred. Up to the present
people have had a clear idea of the
progress of matters in the Philinpines.
Now they are certain to be confused,
for there will be Creelman reports and
truthful reports, and not all are pre
pared to draw the distinction. I am
sorry that some of the men who went
from here to represent local papers did
not remain. Sol Sheridan and Corporal
Healy for The Call, Mart Egan for the
Chronicle and Douglas White for the
Examiner all sent accurate an' inter
esting reports. White was handicapped
by the absurd commissions given him
by his paper, and a ponderous title, but
he did his work well notwithstanding.
Any one of th f ~? men was worth a
dozen Creelmans, but the trouble
seemed to be over and they were with
drawn. Then Creelman was forwarded,
and we realize with pangs that the ac
tual trouble has just begun. Happily,
however, Creelman may be so busy tell
ing Otis and Aguinaldo how to conduct
a war that he will not have time to
cable much but a record of his own
valuable emotions.

I hope there is no treason in expres
sion of the wish that the good and great
Mr. Alger would perceive the beauty
of retiring with his honors thick upon
him and rest in a bower of the laurel
with which he has been showered. . If
he cannot take this view of the case â
still no treasonâ to see him kicked out
of the Cabinet would be a pleasing
spectacle. Probably there was never in
the family of Presidential advisors a
man more incompetent, more distaste
ful, more lacking in public confidence.
People recognize the fact that the War
Department had a vast task to per
form, and that while this was per
formed with expedition every stage of
development reeked with scandal, with
favoritism and with rotten beef. The
present is too late a time to be mak
ing excuses. There can be no excuses
for offense so rank. Neither will the
attempt to prove that the soldiers who
died of his beef were guilty of false
pretense, and that the generals who
made complaint at seeing them die lied
for the lust of lying, tend to create and
perpetuate esteem for Alger. One
thing, however, has been accomplished
by the exhibit of Algerism. He has a
habit of being mentioned as a Presi
dential possibility every four years, and
this habit has doubtless been given a
permanent quietus, wherein fs to be
discerned a grain of comfort.
A California paper complains that
Indians have entered this State from
Nevada and are engaged in the
slaughter of deer. Of course this action
on the part of the ignorant savage is
reprehensible. Any deer would rather
be killed by a white man, clad in
proper hunting togs and with a high
priced gun. lam reminded of the days
when our good forefathers not only
shot all the deer in sight, but potted
the Indian as well, but of course ideals
have changed since those crude times.
There are fools In the world, but little
profit In discussing them, as being
what they are there is no hope ?f wej
form for them. Among the virulent
fools I would give a place to tritz
Haas. He was certain that a rifle was
unloaded, and to justify the faith which
was in him pointed the weapon at a
boy and pulled the trigger. At this
writing there remains a hope that the
boy may recover and a depressing as
surance that Fritz will. There should
be a severe penalty for this sort of
homicidal jocoseness. To term such a
shooting "accidental" is folly. It is de
liberate, inexcusable, and should be
punished by a long term in the peni
tentiary. The person who will in jest
point a gun or any other deadly weapon
at another person is not fit to be at
large. He is either a criminal, an idiot
or a lunatic.

The decadence of Joaquin Miller is a
sad instance of the going out of a great
intellect. The author of some of the
finest poetry ever written in America
and of a virile prose, bespeaking gen
ius, he has descended to the position of
a vaudeville freak, clad in uncouth rai
ment and singing a senseless ditty for
the amusement of a crowd that would
with equal interest gaze upon the fat
lady or the ossified gentleman. He be
comes the object of contempt or of com
miseration. In earlier years he reached
the climax of achievement possible to
him and instead of pausing there has
started down the hither side. Some

For some reason the plan to close the
city cemeteries seems to be in abey
ance, but when the Supervisors have
accomplished the routine of their du
ties I hope this subject will be taken
up again and a decision reached to stop
at the earliest possible moment burials
within the limits of San Francisco. The
reasons for doing this are so many and
so incontrovertible as to leave no room
for argument. In a city a cemetery
not only impedes progress, but it is
likely to poison earth, air or water, or
all of these, and to preserve for the
peril of the living the germs of deadly
disease. Far away from the busy
streets, yet within easy reach, beauti
ful cemeteries have already been pro
vided for Protestants, Catholics and
Jews. They are where for an incalcu
lable number of years they cannot be '<
a detriment and perhaps by the time
they shall be found in the way the
method of burial will be obsolete.
Any American citizen must be inter
ested not alone in the future of the
Philippines as bearing on the welfare
of his own race but in the discussion
the condition has provoked, and the
widely divergent opinions of men
equally conscientious. It seems to me
the fuss is greater than the occasion
warrants, and the fear that in either
outcome the United States will go to
the bow-wows is entirely without foun
, dation. My respected friend, Henry E.
Highton, seems possessed of a terror
that the constitution is being rent into
small bits. He says the constitution,
like the Ten Commandments, is eter
nal as eternity itself, wherefore I am
of belief that he errs. The constitu
tion was formed under stress of cir
cumstances which have passed away,
to meet the requirements of people
who have long been dust. Wise and
glorious as the document is, I do not
see how ft could at that time have been
so contrived as to fill the needs of gen
erations then unborn, to deal with sitUv
ations of which no statesman had the
remotest dream. "Is George Washing
ton a back number?" asks Mr. High
ton. That magnificent personality will
ever remain, and so long as this na
tion exists, be to it a pride and an in
spiration. Solomon was a learned man,
but he would be out of place to-day as
president of Stanford University. The
first builder to construct a locomotive
understood the principle of steam, but
placed on board a modern engine such
as hauls a lightning express now he
would have to ask the location of the
throttle bar, how to apply the air brake
and the meaning of the semaphore.
Despite my regard for the erudition of
Mr. Highton, I am unable to see aught
in the constitution forbidding us to ad
vance, directing us to be a walled-in
nation or thrive upon our own fat in
the manner of a hibernating bear. The
oft quoted precedent set by the Ro
man republic is of no value. The ways
of the Romans were not our ways;
their capabilities were less, their mor
als lower. Washington never recom
mended the use of the horseless car*
riage, never sent a message by wire,
never scratched a match on the rear of
his trousers, never tried his eyes by
electric light, never lolled in a Pullman
at sixty miles an hour. The majesty
of the individual we may justly vener
ate, and his memory cherish, rever
ing his unselfish honor and honesty, but
while Washington is not a "back num.
ber" his ashes are not up to date.
When Dewey destroyed the Span
ish fleet at Manila, my impulse was to
glory in the fact that the American
flag would go up there and stay. Later,
as the natives seemed so valiantly to
object, I regarded them as patriots, and
hoped this Government would find an
opportunity decently to withdraw. The
Filipinos have shown that part of them
need killing and the rest to be govÂ»
erned by a power capable at any time
of crushing them. It will not do to af
firm that the United States undertook
the task as a high and holy mission,
but in great measure the task was
pressed upon this country in such man
ner that to have shirked it would have
been cowardice, and to leave it unfin
ished, the islanders to fighi among
themselves until subjugated by some
nation even more piggish than this,
would add cruelty to cowardice. I no
tice that the same debaters who q
of "mongrel hordes" incapable of
government speak, when the tern bet
ter suits them, of the brave "Filipino
patriots" struggling for a liberty wo
will not permit them to obtain. They
also affirm that with the Philippines
under cur control there will be nothing
to prevent the natives from swarming
to these shores. This tends to sh.w
that their remarks are for effect, and
to thoughtful people the effect is dif
ferent from that expected. Patriots do
not plan massacre, shoot at flags of
truce, make a target of the wounded.
Mongrel hordes do not invade a civil
ized country. When Filipinos get dan
gerously numerous here. Utes will pre
dominate on Broadway and Brule Sioux
b? running the packing houses of Chi
cago. It is well to face facts as they
are. We have paid for the islands good
American blood and a trifle of $20,000,000.
Perhaps the bargain was bad, but jus
tice holds us to it. Sympathy for the
islanders, whn would under this coua
try be given better government than
they ever knew, is wasted, and even
the potent, admirable constitution of
the United States, the protest of its
conservative citizens, can no more stay
the advance of civilization, whether
with Bible or with gun, than prayer
can avert an avalanche.
Occasionally it may be noticed that
some philanthropist is announced to
deliver a lecture to "young men only
Ido not belie- em such lectures. N
listener there hears anything his own
instincts of decency have not taught

When an actress is blessed with your,
and beauty there is a custom of an
nouncing her marriage about oi
so often, giving her an opportunity not
only to indignantly make denial, but
to state that she is wedded to her art

has always seemed to me that the af
fair of selecting a husband for hers. Ir
is one which might as well be left b
an actress, particularly since if sh.
finds the selection injudicious usage
gives her the privilege of trying again,
and as yet there has been no limit set.

THANKS FROM
IOWA MOTHERS
PEC MOINES, lowa, Feb. 16, 1899.
Editor San Francisco Call: During
the time the Fifth lowa Regiment was
in camp in San Francisco reports came
to us constantly of the many kind
nesses received from the Red Cross ard
Catholic Truth societies, and from all
the c zens with whom they be(ia:no
acquainted. ; Many little incidents of
courtesies extended and kindnesses
shown, which went far to relieve the
monotony, fare and inconvenience of
camp life, were noted from time to
time. Two of the companies, A ami R.
are mostly from our, own city and all
wrote glowing accounts of how f he R< 1
Cross met. them when tired and hun
gry and served them with dinner t.
fore the journey to camp was finished
and how that same society remembered
them to the last, furnishing ea_>n with
a â¢ sack containing ah ample lunch,
every article of which was minutely
specified. Even the kind milkman was
not forgotten, who gratutiously emp
tied cans, giving the boys a rich treat
just as they were embarking on the
Pennsylvania. All this, together with
the awful sickness that followed, with
the weary days and nights and their
long continued stay on the vessel has
been written again and again, and
though it may seem a tardy acknowl
edgment, we feel like telling the so
cieties and all who dealt so kindly with
the strangers in their midst that our
hearts will ever go out in gratitude for
the many kindnesses shown our boys.
Some of the mothers of the boys of
companies A and H here in the city
have formed a. cir-le which meets each
Sunday afternoon to talk of, exchange
news items and pray for our absent
boys in the Philippines, and in the last
meeting we decided to send this word
of thanks to all in your good city who
so generously contributed to the pleas
ure and comfort r Â° our loved ones,
many of them absent from home for

PLANS IMPROVEMENTS.
Will ClosÂ« Part of Gap at El-wood.
Block Signal to Be Established
From Here to Baden.
Chief Engineer Hood of the Southern
Pacific Company is preparing plans and
specifications for the building of an ex
tension of its road from Surf to Lompoc.
This will close some of the iifty-miie cap
from Surf to Elwood. It will be about
ten miles in length. ar.d construction of
the line will be commenced as soon as the
right of way is obtained from the Lompoc
authorities, which it Is believed will be
soon forthcoming. Officials of the comp
any have promised to build the road in
time to move this season's croo. which
consists mainly of beets, barley 'mustard
and potatoes. The work will be complet
ed in three months, as the grading is
easy.
At the same time that the Surf-Lompoc
extens>rn is being built the company will
also extend the main line from Guada
loupe Station to the Guadaloupe Refinery,
a distance of five miles, and the growers
in that section will be materially bene
fited by both improvements.
General Manager Krutschnitt states
that three of the thirty-five "Mogul"
engines, which were ordered some months
ago. have arrived at Tucson.. Arizona, and
will be put on ths ran between that place
and Los Angeles. 'With the engines and
the *>Â» freight cars which the compaay
has ordered it will have enough rolling
stock to meet all Increasing demands for
some time to come.
The steel bridge, now being constructed
over Alameda Creek at Sunol. has been
completed. It is 3>30 feet long and is
notable from the fact that the largest
steel girders ever brought to the Pacific
Coast have entered into Its construction.
They are 100 feet long and i t eel deep.
TherYuma bridge is also nearly done, one
span of the three to be built having been
completed.
The company is ' about to introduce a
block signal on the Coast Division from
the Sixteenth-street shops to Baden. The
system will consist of semaphore arms,
which will signal from ICCO to 3Â») feet and
will be absolute block signals so that it
will be impossible for trains to get by
between signals and the danger of colli
sion will b* redcced to a minimum.

About a dozen sailors applied to Assist

yesterday for warrants for the arrest
Of Captain Robert J. Graham and Sec
-1 ond Mate Arthur Moye for cruelty to sea
men during the voyage of the ship Ers
ktee 3JL Pnelpa from Baltimore to this
port. They complained that their rations
were six ounces of bread, three ounces of
scraps of salthorse and soup three
times a- day, the latter made of three
i quarters of a Quart of beans an.i as much
water as the men wanted to drink.
They complained also that the second
mate beat then. frequently with his lists
and belaying pins, blackening their eyes,
cracking their skulls and warping their
! lean ribs.
The captain and the mates deny the al
legations, and say that of the twenty-six
men of the crew only two were able-bod
ied seamen, five ordinary seamen, and the
i remainder awkward landlubbers "not
I worth the powder to blow them to Ma

the San Frai ciscc Gas and
Electric Company.
The San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company may not enjoy privileges de
| nied other companies, or in other words,
all companies are entitled to the same
privileges enjoyed by that corporation. I
This was decided yesterday afternoon by
Judge Seaweil in the action instituted by
i the Mutual Electric Light Company
[ against }'...â  . r Phelan and members, of I
the Board at Supervisors for a peremp- ,
tory writ of mandate to compel the de
' fendants to permit plaintiff to erect poles
, within the same limits in which the San
Francisco Company, cp to the issuance
â¢of the writ, held a monopoly. This mo-:
nopoly is row at an end.
The suit decided yesterday by Judge :
SeaÂ» resulted from the awarding by j
the last Board of Supervisors to the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company the j
contract for lighting the public streets, i
Suit was filed by W. R. Summerhaye3. J
representing the Mutual Electric Light !
Company, to annul the contract. The .
company enjoyed Immunity from compe- !
tition. he avered, by reason of the action
of the Supervisors prohibiting- other
companies from erecting poles within cer
tain specified limits.
Judge Sea well held on demurrer that no [
legal contract could be awarded the San 1
Francisco Company unless all com
panies were allowed the same privileges
and the right to bid, which was impossi
ble owing to the action of the Supervi- 1
sors. " '
The case again came up yesterday on an â 
issue of fact raised in the answer filed by
City and County Attorney Lane, it being i
contended in the answer that the plaintiff
corporation -did not have .'inandai back- [
Ing sufScient to admit it entering' the I
ranks of competitors. P. B. Cornwall. [
â¢president of the company, was called to |
the stand to refute this statement. Mr. !
Cornwall -id that the five directors of !
the company represented a capital of I
$100,000,000, an amount in itself sufficient
to guarantee the financial stability of the
company. He further stated that the j
company had expended up^ to the present i
time SIOO.OOO in perfecting its plant. Called I
upon to state the difference in expense In [
laying underground wires and overhead j
Mr. Cornwall gave as an example the fact i
that eleven men can string a m. of i
overhead wire in four days, while It would \
take the same force three weeks to lay \
a mile underground. Mr. Summerhayes j
was then called and testified that his j
company iks now in a position to com- j
pete throughout the entire district west f,
of Larkin street, and Intended to spend j
sufficient capital in enlarging the plant >
to enable it to compete over the entire ;
city. ' [
This ended the morning session. At 2 [
o'clock the case was again taken up. j
Attorney John H. Durst appeared before [
the court, and read an affidavit, signed by j
hlmstlf, in which he asked that a con- I
tinuance be granted that he. as special t
counsel for Supervisor Phelps, 'might ;
file an amended answer to the complaint, >
: .--- contended that the answer filed by [
the City and County Attorney was not ]
a defense to the action, and that :as a |
proper defense existed he asked the right {
far time in which to file the amended s
answer and produce .witnesses to support |
such answer. The .---'-:- allow !
Mr. Phelpa' counsel further time, as [
Mr. Phelps represented only a twelfth of :
the board, and his separate answer did t
not bind the rest of the board. Attorneys l
William Wood and M. M. EM repre- Â»

IX THE RICHMOND DISTEICT.
Property o-wners Are Making Many
Neeued Improvements.
Richmond district has b*=ri receiving
considerable attention of late at the hands
of Its progressive property -owners. The â¢
sewer, that had been permitted to remain
closed on Sixth avenue- and B street in
rear of the French Hospital has after a
gcod deal of stubborn opposition been
connected with the main sewer on Point
| Lottos venue. This sewer connection not |
i only drains the hospital, but also the ad- i
Joining property. The grading and curb
ing on several of the prominent street
crossings on the line of Point Lobos. ave
nue and the Intervening- cross streets has
Just been completed, and the contract for
the grading of Nineteenth avenue from
Point Lobos to M street will be soon let.
No improvements are contemplated on
Thirteenth and Fourteenth avenues, as
! those two avenues will be embraced in
the north arm of Golden Gate Park, which
It 1s proposed to connect with the Govern
\ ment reservation under the contemplated
extension at the panhandle to Van Ness
avenue. -':'- â¢-?-
One of the blue eyesores to Kichmond-
Ites Is Point Lobos avenue from Central
i avenue to the ocean. This thoroughfare
I has been permitted to go from bad to j
worse until it resembles a neglected coun- j
try road more than a city boulevard. The j
fault of this neglect is not chargeable to >
any one department of the city govern- !
ment, but rather to a combination of
events In the shuffle between the Super- ;
visors and the Park Commissioners, under j
whose jurisdiction the avenue now Is. To ;
keep this thoroughfare in proper condi- j
tion would eat up the greater portion of [
the park's appropriation and result in no |
' very great advantage to the people out
side of the residents of the Richmond
i district. By the conditions of the new
i charter, however, all this will be changed
J and Point Lobos avenue will get its share
:of funds and attention. The owners of
' the old racetrack are disposed to have
i the â¢ Pacific Coast exposition of 1901 lo
cated there. This will be opposed by the
Point LObos Improvement Club, which

THE MACCABEES WILL
MEET IN THIS CITY
STATE CONVENTION TO BE HELD ;
MARCH 17.
Ladies' Assembly Will Hold Sessions
Simultaneously Gcod Sprink
ling of Tents and Hives.
The State convention of the Knights of
the Maccabees of California a:. the as
sembly of the Ladies of the Maccabees
â will be held in this city, commencing on
the 17th of March. -This order, which was
founded in 13S1, has more than 5500 tents
. and hives, tents being the name given to
the ".-â¢ting places for the knights and
hives to the meeting- places for the ladies.
The membership at the close of last De
cember was 322JK. The amount disbursed
in benefits during- the time of the exig
ence of the order is Â»,552.453, and the
amount disbursed during- t!je Band year
ending- July, IS9B, was 12,03:1,133.
The ladies* branch of the order, while
working- on the same lines as the knights
as to benefits, is a. woman's organization,
pure and simple, and numbers at this time
about 90,000 in the United States. The
claim is made for it that It is the only
order in the Union that Is composed ex
clusively of women, and whose affairs are
conducted exclusively by women. Mrs.
Lillian M. Hollister of Detroit, Mich., is
the supreme lady comma:
The reports which will be presented at
the convention of the Knights will show
that during the year ISSÂ»s the Increase in
membership in the supreme jurisdiction
was in excess of 40,0<Â». and while there
were Tosses from various causes, still the
net Increase was almost 24,000.
The .growth of the Ladies, as will ap
pear during the session of the assembly,
is marvelous. A. large number of hives
have been established, and in almost ev
ery place the membership has equaled the
numerical strength of the tent in the
same place and in some instances It has
: surpassed it- S. W. Hail is the State
Commander of the Knights in California,
I and Mrs. Eudocia S. Moffat is the State
: lady commander.
Dor the sessions of the two bodies
there will be distributed a "Golden State
Maccabee souvenir." in the shape of a
book of some thirty pages of the finest
paper. In which will be printed a brief his
tory of the order, national and State, and
photographs of the supreme officers, the
State and tent officers, delegates to the
'. convention and officers of the hive and its
G During the time that the two bodies will
be In session It is probable that there will
be a reception in one of the public hall 3.
during which the floor work by Knights
in elaborate and expensive costumes will
be given, and that a display of the very
fine floor work that marks the installation
ceremonies of the ladies will also be
j given. _

There is confusion in the National
Guard of California, and the members
are asking each other, "where are we
at?" Seme portion of the guard is tinder
the Impression that the withdrawal of the
name of John H. Dickinson for the posi
tion of major general has acted as an
abolishment of the office without the is
suance of orders from a superior officer
announcing that fact, but the major gen
eral is of the opinion that such is not the
case and that he is still the major gen
eral until there is an announcement In
â orders or his successor is appointed, is
confirmed by the Senate and qualifies,
and taking that view he still holds on.
The division headquarters, which for a
(--: closed, are again open,
rs or his successor is appointed, is
KaMd by the Senate and in*
I view he Btffl holds on.
â  headquarters, â which for a
: time were doted, are again open.
and those who believe with General
Dickinson transact such business as they
may have with that office.
Within the past few days there have
been indications which are from a politi
cal standpoint very Scant. They are
to the effect that Major General Dickin
son will be renominated by the Governor
and that he will be continued as com
mander of the State's military.
' It is expected that the bill for the re
organization of the guard will be taken
up next week and that with a few slight
amendments it will pass. The bill has
been favorably passed upon by the joint
Military Committee of the two houses,
and while a few changes were made,
they were not material, except in the
matter of the staff of the commander in
chief. In the bill as presented the staff
was cut down to a very small number,
but before It left the hands of the com
mittee it was altered m that the Govern
or's ornamental retinue shall remain as
ft is now. jYv
In the bill for general appropriations in
troduced In the Legislature the sum for
the National Guard, which includes six
teen items, aggregates $341^10, or *1"'J.920
a year for the next two years. One of
the items Is the allowance of JSG.COO for
encampments, which means $15,000 per
year and as in the past that amount has
not been sufficient for a yearly encamp
ment it is pr-sumed that it is the inten
aon to use the entire sum for one en
campment next year and not have one
tht? year. In the various items there Is no
appropriation for the revision of the red
took? something which the guard stands,
very much in need of and has needed for
a number of years. âÂ»,Â«,Â»#

GENEROUS SUMS
TO BE SPENT
IN CALIFORNIA
Big Appropriations by
Congress.
PRESIDENT WILL VISIT US
WOBK ON NEW POSTOFFICE TO
BEGIN SOON.
Congressman Julius Kahn Beturns
From Washington With a Batch
of Good News and Stories
of Eastern Weather.
.Congressman Julius Kahn. who went to !
Washington on January 15 to assume his. l
duties .-is representative of the Fourth
District, returned to San Francisco a day
â¢or two ago. Congressman Kahn found j
the Eastern weather very severe, and the j
sudden change of temperature brought on j
an acute attack of rheumatism, which j
'disabled him. He expects to soon be ,
about, however, and restored to his usual
health and vigor. Speaking of his recep- j
. tion by his fellow-Congressmen and the. i
conditions now existing in Washington,
â  Mr. Kahn said:
?â¢ "1 was most cordially received by the
-.older members of Congress, both Demo- ;
rats. and Republicans, and 1 expect to :
/â¢return there next fall and be able to ac- |
complish much for the interest and wel
fare of California. Our State has at the,
'â "present time a solid delegation at the \
aiational capital, and with a continuance j
. : -o.f the unanimity of feeling which now
â exlMs we will be able to secure for Call- |
: Â£brnia that recognition she deserves.
. :' "By the legislation enacted during the j
; ''Session now about to close California has
glared well. The river and harbor bill car
'â rli.s an appropriation of $1,250,000 for im
provements In this State, and the ex
penditure of this considerable sum will
â¢ 'surely benefit a great many working-men
'.and .tradespeople. Included in this bill is '
.;.a provision for the blowing up of Shag
â  : &nd Arch rocks at the entrance to Golden â 
iGate harbor, which have always been a j
.'.Thenace to incoming and outgoing ships; ,
'â improvements of the San. Joaquin and j
unento rivers; the dredging of
.â sloughs and such other work as the en
gineers deem necessary a long the coast
is provided for. This is the largest sum
appropriated for river and harbor im- i
provements for California for many j
â¢ years.
. -:." "Before leaving Washington 1 received
most positive assurances from high offi
cials that the construction of the new
â¢Pestofiice building would soon begin and
.be prosecuted with energy from now on.
lilefore- the end of the year the rim story
â  M the building will be up. The appropri- j
ation for the building is $500,000, and the
â¢â¢â supervising architect of the treasury says
â¢rthat, while no radical changes could oe
itiade in the plans which have been here- |
tofore approved, the wishes of the people
.\;t>f' San Jj'rancisco would be regarded as
' tar "as possible, and such changes made
'as are compatible with the architectural
â¢/beauty of the structure. The architect
â¢'..pledges his professional reputation that
â .the Federal building now being erected in
â San Francisco will De one of the most im
posing structures in America. As pro
vided in the original specifications noth
ing but California material is to be used
in .the new Postofflce. Granite and mar
â¢ ble will both be used. Some revision has
been made in the specification which were
-iabbut completed when 1 left the capital
.and proposals for bids will probably be
'advertised within a week. Tnen as soon
â¢"as Congress adjourns and the half mil
.'lion appropriation is available the con
, struction or the building will be proceeded
â¢ With and continue without cessation until
finished.
'â¢President McKlnley has repeatedly an
â¢ iriouhced his intention to visit the Pacific
Coast some time during the coming Con
; gressional vacation. H.is plans are all
made for the visit and unless the condi
. tion. of affairs in the Philippines becomes
100 greatly involved or some unforeseen
; emergency should arise the arrangements
'/sViH not be changed.
"The feeling among Congressmen for
California and California's interests is
â¢ extremely cordial and 1 am satisfied that
-any. reasonable demand for legislation to
â¢protect and enhance our interests and
Increase our prosperity will be readily re
ceived and willingly granted. Our State
is just beginning to be appreciated in the
. .East and at the capital and our business
: men and representatives should all unite
in furthering the welfare of our grand
commonwealth. Everything directly or
indirectly connected with the State is
watched closely and as we will receive
more direct benefits from the acquisition
of the Philippines than any other section
of the. country, the administration has
California wefare in mind in pursuing
its present expansion policy. Sentiment
in the East is universally and overwhelm
ingly in favor of expansion. I talked with
.business men in New York and while
â traveling, and found very few opponents
. of. expansion.
.' "The California delegation will make a
.. determined effort to secure the passage
'â¢ fit the Nicaragua Canal bill before this
.; session of Congress is adjourned, and the
prospects for success are very bright. The
measure, however, will have to be in
â  eluded in one of the general appropriation
.bills, as It is impossible, under the rules
â of the lower house, to secure special time
for the separate consideration 'of the
project. The Senate is overwhelmingly in
favor of the canal, and from what I could
learn of the sentiment in the House I am
.inclined to believe that the b.ll could be
â¢ parsed by a good majority if an oppor
tunity to vote on it is given the members.
â  "Members of the two houses of Congress
and the leading men of the administra
â¢ tion do not think that an extra session
will be called. The only emergency which
would have impelled tHe President to call
an extra session has been overcome. That
was the failure on the part of Congress
to pass a measure for the maintenance of
an army of sufficient strength to meet ail
possible contingencies. The probable suc
cess of the compromise army bill has
brought about the result sought by the
administration, and therefore no extra
session is necessary. The President was
averse to an extra session, and with all
â  difficulties now adjusted the administra
tion can proceed with its plans without
apprehension or delay and then let the
people approve or reject his policy at the
next Presidential election. .
The army reorganization bill is an ab
solute necessity. The term of enlistment
of nearly all the volunteers was for two
years, or until the war was over. The
. soldiers were assured that discharges
would be granted on personal applications
.. When peace was finally declared. Requests
for discharges are- now coming into the
War Department by the thousands, and
this condition forced the President to in
" . sist on the enactment of a remedy."
Congressman Kahn has had all the win
ter weather he cares- for. There is no
craving in his heart for the exquisite joys
Of zero temperature and the dallying bliz
zard zephyrs which have prevailed In the
East this season. When the mercury was
frozen and the cold winds were whistling
'through the corridors of the Capitol, the
Congressman says he haunted the mem
: bers' lobby, where the wall is covered
with an immense weather map of the
United States. Morning and night a clerk
from the Weather Bureau posts a weath
or' report where all the members may
read. Representatives from the North
South. K.tst and W. st would gather and
shrver when they saw the reports from
their sections.
"Phew, but it's cold in my district,"
these men would remark. Then the Cali
forninn would step proudly forward and
with commiserating emphasis remark;
"Oh. I see the temperature In San Fran
cisco is 65 to-day. That's not so bad."

DAUGHTERS OF WORKMEN
CHRISTEN THREE NEW BOATS
Novel Feature of the Launching of the Fearless,
Union and Wallula.
Between the hours of 11 and 12 yester- I
day three new tugboats, with sparkling ;
California champagne dripping from their j
prows, slid gracefully from the ways at
the Union Iron Works into their natural |
element. They were the tugs Fearless,
built for John D. Spreckels Bros. & Co..
Union, belonging to the Union Iron
Works, and Wallula, built for the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company.
While there was little ceremony attach
ed to the launching of the boats, it was
a novelty in its way. Heretofore when
i a new daughter has been given to Nep- j
I tune it has been customary for a daugh
j ter of one of the directors of the works,
the owner of the vessel or some official
dignitary to break the bottle and formal
ly christen the new craft. Yesterday,
however, the old order was changed, and
the honors fell upon the brawn and mus
cle of the great shipbuilding yards. Three
daughters of three foremen were the chief
figures at the ceremony, as it was thought
but fitting that as the men do the actual
work on the craft, their children should
be entitled to the honor of giving the ves
sels their names. And yesterday was a
happy day for the officers of the works,
as well as for the workmen and the work
i men's children. ;
It was an Ideal day for a launching.
There was not a cloud in the sky and the
gentle breeze which came up from the
bay was mild and balmy. The sun glit
tered and sparkled on the myriad of rip
pling waves, to greet the new craft. Even
! the pestiferous fog took a day off and the
I atmosphere was so clear that the hills
across the bay stood out in bold relief
against the distant sky line. Spectators
crowded along the shore, climbed upon
the new Wisconsin or found points of
vantage from the numerous small boats
1 which dotted the bay, from which to
i view the sight. On the ways in the yard
I stood the three boats, looking ungainly
I on their high perches of heavy timber.
The new Fearless was the first to re
' ceive attention. A few minutes before 11
â  o'clock a gang of workmen began knock
ing away the stays. A platform had been
' erected at her bow and on this stood Miss
May Telfer. her father, looking proud
i and happy, and a few friends. Just on
1 the stroke of the hour the last braoe was
knocked away. Miss Telfer grasped the i
bottle of wine, which was suspended from j
the bow by a blue silk ribbon, and dashed
i it against the side of the boat, at the
same time naming it "Fearless." As the

A California Crew May Bow at the j
Paris Exposition.
At the dinner given last Sunday at a
downtown restaurant to the board of
managers of the Pacific Association of
the Amateur Athletic Union by President
J. R. Bockman representatives of almost
all the clubs in the association were pres
ent. The guests included John I. Nolan of
the Ariels, S. J. Pembroke of the Ala
medas, A. P. Rothkopf of the Dolphins, j
H. Hauser of the Grammar School Ath- I
letic League, W. C. Espy of the Pioneers,
M. Breen of the South Ends, H. A. Keeler
of the Academic Athletic League, P. D. f
Franklin of the University of California, j
â lieumiller of me Stockton Athletic !
Club, George James and J. W. Morton of ;
the Olympic Club. j
S J. Pembroke broached his plan of
getting together an elght-oared crew from
the University of California to row at the !
Paris Exposition. One of the regents of :
i the university recently said, when the
matter was placed before him, that he
did not think that an eight from Callfor- ,
1 nia could expect to beat all foreign crews, j
: when a splendidly trained and coached j
' crew from Yale had failed to win the
grand challenge cup at the Henley re
gatta Nevertheless, the project of send
ing a Californian eight to Paris is one j
that deserves the support of the commu- i
i nity The Australians long ago discover-
I ed "that the cricket elevens ?Â»nt to I-^ng
land from the Antipodes served to make !
the colonies known In the old country as
nothing else did. In the same way a crew ;
of stalwart California boys would attract
the attention of Europe to this coast.
The Alameda Boat Club committee on
joining the National Association of Ama
teur Oarsmen consists of H. w. Maas,
S. J. Pembroke and \Y. B. Hinchman. j
There is much talk among the Alameda
men of leaving the Pacific Association, |
and the club has already for two seasons !
been a member of the National Associa- J
Uon.
Several of the Alameda men are prac- :
1 ticing in outrigged skiffs; among those
j who expect to make some of the eham
-1 pions look to their laurels are Theodore
Eisfeldt. G. Pesoli, Arthur Hammersmith
and Otto Riehl.

boat glided down the ways her whistle
began to sound and the ?nng was taken
up by other boats in the bay and all the
whistles at the works.
A salute was fired and flags were dipped
as the new tug slipped into the bay. and
rode the water as gracefully as a duck.
while a cheer went up from the crowds
of spectators.
The next to be launched was tho Union.

A SERIES OF
GULES DELAYED
THE ZEALANDIA
Rough Time on the
Way From Manila.
CAFTAIN DOWDEIL HONORED
THE BARK CROWN OF INDIA
MAKES PO. ! AT LAST.
Collision the Bay â New Steamer
for Stockton 'irade â Ihe Old
Newport to, Be Made Into
a Steam Schooner.
The transport Zealandla docked at Pa
cific street wharf yesterday. The vessel
had a fearful time of It during the voy
age from Manila, and she shows the signs
of her battles with the elements. No
sooner would one storm die out than an
other would come up, and the stout
steamer did not escape them until the
Farallones were passed. Nearly all the
cabins and staterooms on the vessels were
gutted, and not a man on the vessel had
a clean suit of clothes to put on when
port was reached. Chief Steward Pen
field had ail his ( white suits and shirts
ruined by a bottle of red and another of
black ink and a bottle of mucilage break
ing among them.
The last time she came back from Ma
nila the Zealandia was caught in a ty
phoon and had to put into Nagasaki for
repairs. The crew all vow that this voy
ae>- was even worse than the first and
they never want to go through another
one likt it.
The Tennessee boys who went from here '
to Manila on the Zealandia had a splendid
time on the way down, and a very hand
some testimonial was presented to Chief
Steward Penlkld. To Captain Dowdell the
officers presented a magnificent silver cup
whiYh stands-over two feet high. On it
is the following Inscription:
CAPTAIN THOMAS DOWDELL, Master S. S.
Zealandia,
From the Officers of the
FIRST TENNESSEE INFANTRY, U. S. VOL.,
December 13, 1398.
Dr. C. H. Lowell, who went to Manila
as surgeon on the Zealandia, married a
Red Cross nurse and will practice in the
Philippines. Soon after graduating Dr
Lowell was taken ill, and Miss Corson. a
professional nurse, saved his life. On the
Zealrindla the nurse and patient met
again, with the result that on the vessel's
arrival in Manila they became man ajid
wife.
The British ship Crown of India has at
last reached San Francisco. She left New
castle, N. S. W.. for this port 296 days
ago, and when a few days out came near
going to the hottom. When. 150 miles off
shore the ship ran into a terrific storm. ,
Her foremast was carried away twenty ;
feet above the deck and the maintopmast
eight feet below the lower cap, while the
mizzen topgallant mast went by the
board. The storm increased in fury, and
both captain and crew hourly expected
the vessel to go down. Vessel after vessel
passed, but all of them seemingly had all
they could dr> to attend to their own safe
ty, until the ' American four-masted
schooner Golden Shore, Captain Rasmus
sen, came along. The latter vessel sig
naled the Crown of India asking if assist
ance was needed, and when word was
sent back that there was no immediate I
danger Captain Rasmussen hove his ves
sel to, and through the whole of that ter
rific night and part of the next day stayed
by the disabled ship. When Rasmussen
saw assistance coming he up helm and
stood away for Newcastle, N. S. *) â¢
Captain Corkhill of the Crown of India
did not forget the incident and as soon
as he got his vessel into a place of safety
he sent a handsome present to Captain
Rasmussen and another to his wife, .who
was with him on that memorable night.
It was late In May when the Cmn of
India was towed Into Sydney harbor, and
it was December 11 before she sailed
again for San Francisco. New spars had |
to be procured from Scotland causing the ,
delay. The run here was made in the fas ,
time of seventy-six days. She anchored
off Melggs wharf, and during .after- I
noon the revenue cutter Rush drifted j
down on her. The latter had been over to ,
California City for target practice and to
drill the crew. Coming back to the front |
the Rush was anchored near the Crown
of India. The cutter's anchor did not ,
hold and she drifted down on the ship, i
Tugs separated them before much dam- ;
age was done. _ Â
The British bark Cardigan Castle ar- j
rived from Newcastle, N. S. "W., after a 1
long passage of eighty-two days Captain
GouWing was bewailing his hard luck m
having met nothing but light winds and
calms until in latitude 34 deg. la mm.
north, longitude 135 deg. 19 mm. west he ;
spoke the British bark Brussels, which
Balled from Newcastle for San Francisco :
twelve days before him. ,
A new steamer has just been launched
at Stockton for the California Navigation
and Improvement Company. She has been
named J. R. McDonald after the ex-State
Treasurer. She is 105 feet long, 24, feet
broad, 5 feet deep and draws Id inches or
waiter
The 'old steamer Newport is going back
into the coasting trade. â¢ Away back in
the seventies she was built by, the farm
! ers of Anaheim to run in opposition to the
Pacific Coast Steamship Company. Alter
i a time the two concerns amalgamated,
i and for years the Newport sailed under
'the steamship company's flag. Then she
' was sold to the Pacific Steam Whaling
| Company and made two cruises to â  the
I Arctic, arriving home on the last occa
! sion in October. She has now been cut
| down and thoroughly overhauled, and
! when she next appears on the front she
I will be a steam schooner and ready for
1 business. â . _
The transport Roanoke is to sail at 2
p. m. to-day for Manila. Captain Kidston
goes out in command and Captain Fer
guson will be his first officer. Dr. Dig
gins will be the vessel's surgeon and
genial Tom James the chief steward.
Members of the Grand Army of the Re
public visited the lowa yesterday after
noon. One hundred of the members were j
taken out on the launches Amy and Wil- |
liam D and they had a most enjoyable |
time. The battleship will be open to the |
public again to-day, and the launches will
run as usual from the Folsom-street float.
William Seeckings was treated at the
Harbor Receiving Hospital yesterday for
a painful cut on the right arm. He was
climbing a flagpole at the corner of
Broadway and Montgomery avenue to fix
the halyards. When half way up the pole
he slipped and began to slide back. When
twelve feet from the ground his arm
caught in a projecting piece of tin and
tore the skin badly. The shock caused .
Seeckings to drop to the ground, from
which he was picked up unconscious and
hurried to the hospital.
Chased With a Knife.
Mrs. A. Cassini, who has a frultstand j
at 2028 Fillmore street, swore to a com- !
plaint in Judge Treadwell's court yester- j
day for the arrest of Joe Jillio on the [
charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
Jillio has a flshstand adjoining Mrs. Cas- j
sini's fruitstand and Friday morning he '
claimed to be the owner of both stands. I
and when Mrs. Cassini and her husband ;
remonstrated with him he chased them j
with a long fish knife In his hand. They
were afraid to return until after Jillio
was arrested yesterday afternoon.
Dougherty Arraigned.
John Dougherty, ex-treasurer of the
Marine Fireman's Union, charged with
felony embezzlement, was arraigned be
fore Acting Police Judge Groezinger yes
terday By consent the case was contin
ued until March 6. Ex-Judge Ferral ap
peared for the defendant and asked that
his bonds of $20,000 be reduced. There was
only one charge against him of em
bezzling $1100, and the bail was absurdly
high The Judge reduced it to $10,000 and
intimated that if other charges were not
made he would reduce it to $3000.

" AN ANTE-MORTEM STATEMENT
â ACCUSES PHILIP FFJRTTxTTA OF
â :'.â -â  V STABBING HIM.
â¢TlSey Quarreled Over Ferttitta's At
'â¢. tentions to a Married "Woman,
â  " " : - as He Was to Marry Si
erro's Cousin.
.
Joseph Sierro, who tts.s final in a dy- !
â¢â¢ ir-g- condition In front of SU Sansome street
â  Friday night, died at the Harbor Receiv
â : r r.g Hospital at absut 2 o'clock yesterday
-"morning. For a time ha persisted in say- ;
â¢â  fcg that the knife wound that caused his
'"-death was seif-inSicted. but just before
he expired he admitted in the presence of
: policeman Fowle, Dr. Vonderleith and the
matron that Philip Femitta stabbed him.
, . ' Ferttltta lived at 3ii S&nsome street and
I Sierro called there Friday night upon Sal- j
' vatore Rinaldo. Ferttltta â was to be mar- j
Philip Ferttitta.
The Alleged Assassin
â¢â :' ried to Sierro's cousin, the daughter of
-J-SalV&tore S!erro, IS Vande water street.
': Sierro objected to Ferttitta' s attentions
; Wo Jilrs. Rir.aldo and he and Ferttitta kept
: -growing at each other until Mrs. Rinal
â  : &6- toM Sierro to stop insulting Ferttitta
â \ ard go home. Sierro left the house and.
J "according to Mrs. Rlnaldo, stood outside
.". and dared Ferttitta to come out. Fertit
: >a." accepted the challenge and she saw
'. \teza. scnGlr-s on the street. Then Sierro
â¢ ! fell and Ferttitta came into the house for
Â° a niinute and disappeared. Sierro had
.â¢'â¢ been stabbed with a carvii^ knife, which
. -was found beside him.
â¢ After Sierro died his body was removed
t& the Morgue and Dr. Zabaia made an
' sutop^y on it. He found that the knife
â¢â¢ had entered the left breast, pierced the
â  liver passed through the macs and
â¢â  reached' the spinal column. _
. " When Captain Bohen was notified of thÂ©
â¢ statement made by Sierro accusing Fert
â¢ titfa. he" detailed Detective George Mc
iiahon and Policeman Fowle on the case.

â¢â¢ are Sicilians and members of the Mafia.
' as was Sierro. Ferttitta was prominent

THE ARMY CANTEEN.
Is It Wise to Abolish It?
I The Hull- army bill bas been seat to the
[ United States Senate from the House ,
I with a -rider." attached at the eleventh i
! bottr which prohibits the sale of oeer at j
f the pest exchanges, or. as they are com- j
' ntonly known, the canteens. This amend- ;
, meet was adopted in deference to intern- j
Pirate temperance sentiment, rendered -
: vocal by the Woman's Christian Tern- j
perance Union. The amendment is. m [
â  my opinion, unwise. It will not operate. ,
â  in' practice, to the benefit of the army. }
Temperance people will point to riots and ;
disorders at the camps of our volunteer
force* during the recent war with spa.n.
Very weO. The case is not in point, D - 3 "
â  cipline was notoriously ted among forces
' officered by men who might want, or
â  whose friends might want, the votes or â¢
; the privates after disbandment. Tne Hull |
: bill is intended to apply to the regntex i
: army, under a discipline enforced ty t
trained regular officers without regard ;
â  for anything but the efficiency cf me
; army and the credit accruing to them .or
i maintaining good discipline.
The canteen in the army is the growth
' of centuries. It is the outgrowth of ages ;
I cf military experience. It is a device for
' preventing drunkenness among soldiers.
â¢ adopted in preference to the method of
punishing for drunkenness. In our army !
t*e canteen is conducted under
L strict regulations. The post commandant
< :s held responsible for the enforcement of
â  'he -eeuiaUons. He is assisted by "a can
-1 teen council" composed of three ofneers |
â  one of whom is in immediate charge 01 ;
â  the canteen. It is also under the imme- j
, diate supervision of the "oScer of .ac ,
' day." Ail articles disposed of at the can- ;
' teen are soid at a bare advance upon the â¢
i original cost. The profits go to the credit ;
jo* the organizations at the post. This .
< money is expended by the company com- ,
i manders in the purchase of '.uxunes, Uke j
butter, milk. eggs, game, cheese, etc.. not
[ found on the regular bill of fare. E\ery ,

a factor in sustaining the morale of the
force It keeps the men at the post, out
of vile wbisky dives and houses of ill- [
repute near the post. A canteen at Fort j

which the soldier is robbed.
The testimony of the adjutant general,

the imaginary evils cf the institution? It
works for order, for morality, for health,

I which the army is, ordinarily, recruited.

THE SAX FEAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1899.
THE RAT WAS KICKED
OVER THE TRANSOM
J. UST one rat raised an alarm of fire In the Fairmount Hotel last Thursday
night, and brought hysterics to just five girls.
Just five sirls: Just five rirls:
Rupmred ihelr ccrsets and spoiled their curls:
Because of that fccrrid rat.
A conversazione -was in full progress at the time, and three reputations had
been talked into tatters in the rotiin of a South American diplomat when the rat
came. He did not come in the usual -way. gnawing -ugh the floor, but in a
great hurry, which was very unusual and undignified for a rat. â 
It happened in this way:
A young man was passing through- the haiiway of the hotel on the second
floor, and when opposite the room of the diplomat a giant gray rat with
a manEj- taii ran in front of him. The young man was formerly a football
punter and he at once, to use his own words, "hit the beast a swift kick." The
rat. instead of being projected to the further end of the hall, caromed en the
wall and went sailing high up into the air. The transom over the door of the
diplomat's room was open, and his ratship alighted on the upper side of the
~iass "chuted" the chute and fell, first on the head and thence into the lap of the diplomat's wife.
c*e * â¢'â¢Wow::t Fire"! Murder": Ouch!!! Police!:: screamed the astonished women, almost paralyzed with terror. The
uproar brought th~ landlady, the clerks and a score of lodgers hurrying to the scene.
The diplomats wife, the wife of "a well-known contractor and two other married ladies were standing on chairs.
ho'dirg their skirts tiehtlr against their ankles, and yelling for the police."
The unfortunate rodent was more frightened than his victims, and escaped into the back parlor, where he was
clubbed to death by a party of indignant and merciless citizens.

United States Senator Redfleld Proctor
of the town of Proctor, Vl, began suit in
the United States 'Circuit Court yester
day against the city and county of San

vaxa lot bounded as follows: '
Beginning at the intersection of the north

line of Octavia street, thence north -' feet

Sacramento street: thence east 137 :S feet
to th<! point cf beginning. The value of tie
lot Is stated to be JtS.CCO.
The complaint recites that the prede
cessors of the complainant in July. ISO,
took possession of a tract of pueblo land
embracing the lot in controversy, and
that they and their grantees continuously
maintained their title and possession up
to I?SS. when the city expelled the plain
tiff and took possession. He asks that
the lot be surrendered to him and that
hi 3 title be acknowledged and confirmed.
The lot is a part of Lafayette Square,
which has been beautified and Improved
by the city within the last four years. The
Issues raised on the trial of the case will
be similar to those in the cue of the city
vs. Lawyer Hoi'.aday. who holds posses

PRIZES TO BE AWARDED.
Original Work at the University of
California to Be Stimulated.
The Council of the Associated Alumni \
of the University of California met last
evening at the Hopkins Institute of Art
for the purpose of taking action on the j
report of the committee which was ap- '
pointed some months ago to formulate a I
scheme whereby prizes should be given i
to encourage any original work in any
department of the university. President [
W. E. Bitter of the council presided at i
the meeting The report of the commit
tee, which "consisted of J. M. Whitworth. \
Dr. H. Kugeler and J. D. Hodgea, was |
read by the secretary and then taken up
for general discussion- It was not f
adopted last night, but on motion went r
over for further consideration at the next !
meeting of the council.
There is no doubt that the report I
of the committee will ultimately be â¢;
adopted, with possibly some amendments. :
The report provides for the giving of i
prizes for original work done in any de- \
partment of -the university. The prixes (
are to be awarded by the council, which I
will have the assistance of the professors
of the university in making selections.
The prizes will be awarded on the capers
that are submitted, the council reserving
the right to reject all papers submitted
if it sees fit to do so.

with but live facing the issue, Tom
Ryan's Dunois enjoyed the honors of
favoritism in the betting. It was a very
sharp betting race, anu it is probable that
Topmast, Adolph Spreckels, Buckwa and
Roslnante commanded almost as much
support as the favorite. Before post call
It was said Buckwa would run a great
race, and the bay gelding fulfilled ex
pectations. Sent out by Bullman at the
start to make the pace, he set a merry
one, with the riders behind him all hust
ling their mounts along. At the end of a
mile he still maintained a comfortable
lead, with Spreckels and Dunois hot after
him. A furlong from the stand the favor
ite was done, and Spencer, on the Corri
f;an entry, hitched up with Buckwa. The
atter did not falter with his 116 pounds
up, and was only beaten out the last few
strides, failing to land by a neck. Spen
cer, on the winning horse, rode, a superb
race, and was generously applauded by
the big crowd.
It was a disastrous day for favorites
and their following. Of the six choices
selected to win. all proved disappoint
ments but O'Connel and Key del Tierra.
The former has been added to. the list of
coast iecord-holders. In the fifth number
on the card the veteran downed Rubicon
a neck, and rattled off the six furlongs in
l:l2*s, within one-quarter of a second of
the world's record for the distance. The
final race of the day went to Etta H.,
against which odds of 35 to 1 were ob
tainable. .
The sport began with a mild dump. A
sprint over Futurity course with a bunch
of eleven lining up. the well backed Tibu
ron appeared to be winning, when John
ny Reiff on Watossa. an S* pounder and
10 to 1 in the ring, popped out of the field,
winning by a head. Dolore, the first
choice, showed no speed whatever.
Bee Bee. the Burns & Waterhouse entry
in the four furlong scramble for 2-year
olds, was sent to the post a 3 to 2 choice.
She rap with plenty of gameness, but was
outfooted the entire route and beaten half
a length by Bathos, the second choice.
The capture of the mile selling event by
Rev del Tierra turned out a most expen
sive one for Edward Purser, the animal's
owner. The Prince of Norfolk gelding
ruled a 3 to 5 favorite, and in a long, hard
drive, earned the decision over Lost Girl
by a. nose, in 1:401*. Entered to be sold
for $500. the winner was. bid up to $1500
by Al. Martin, trainer of Lost Girl. The
stable then bid the customary 55. retain
ing the horse. , ,
The Rubicon people thought so well of
the big chestnut horse that they bet a
chunk on him to down O'Connell. The
latter with Piggott in the saddle was a
prime facorite. Rubicon ran a grand
race but could never head the veteran,
and in a gruelling drive, was led over
the line less than half a length. Tam
many Hit!! finished third, about six
lengths away. â¢ ; .1-
The one big surprise happened m the
final live furlong sprint. Ed. Gartland.
considered invincible and a 4 to 5 choice,
finished among the "also rans." display-
Ing no speed whatever. Moving up from
fifth place in the stretch turn. Etta H.
pilotea by Gus Wilson, won hands down.
Highland" Ball received tne verdict over
Mainstay for the place.

Notwithstanding a sharp north "wind
that brought tears to the eyes of those
who witnessed the run-down of the great
one hundred dog stake meeting yesterday
at Ingleside Coursing Park, the crowd
at the pleasure grounds was as large as
on any previous day when a particularly

paid attention to the remarks made in

many dollars, as there were nine short
enders who figured as winners of the
number stated in the report.

from the following times that were taken

The coursing to-day should be the most ;
exciting of any meeting heretofore held
En the park, because of the fact that the i
grandest performers in the country will
meet in the sÂ«lips. The sport will' com
mence promptly at 10 o'clock, and those
who miss seeing the five courses on the
head of the card will certainly regret the
fact of their being detained elsewhere, as
the dogs are considered so well matched '
that only the lucky guessers can call the
turn.
Judging from the way the long tails
ran yesterday, the "flyers" who should
capture the winning colors in the first
': round of the stake are: Eclipse. Motto,
Luxor. Petronius. Marietta. Mountain
Beauty. Royal Duke. Tea Rose. Law
rence. Clifton Lass. Magdaliah. Fear Not,
Jenny Wilson. Billy Gladstone. Maud S, !

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
UITLANDERSâ A.. French Camp, Cal.
Uitlander is the name that is applied by I
the Boer? in Africa to foreigners, and it |
means outlanders.
ONE OF IS36â G. G. 8., Confidence, Tuo- !
lumne County, Cal.: A $5 piece of 1836 does i
not command a premium, nor does any
coined subsequent to 1834.
NOT PREMIUM COINSâ H. McF., Fol- i
som, Cal., and A Reader, City. None of '
j the coins described in your letter of in
| qulry command any premium. A $5 plecs
I of 1835 is not a premium coin.
WAGESâ J. 8., Gualala. Cal. Without i
a knowledge of the manner of payment J
of wages of a firm or corporation, it is j
impossible to answer a question as to >
whether an employe must take a time '
check or can insist on a demand for cash.
It depends upon the custom of the party i
| paying the wages.
THE OPERAâ L. A., City. A girl who
is pretty, well advanced in music, but is I
without knowledge of the requirements ;
of the stageâ that is, one who has not had i
training for the operatic stage â would
have but a poor show to obtain a position
with an operatic company, unless it was
in the chorus. Did she in that position |
| develop unusual talent and aptitude for
the operatic stage she would be taken ;
from the ranks and advanced.
HAWAIIAN DEBT LAWâ A. S., City.
The law of the Hawaiian Islands in re- j
gard to debt still holds good. A person
on the islands, even a stranger, can obtain
credit, but as long as he owes a dollar he
is not permitted to leave the island on
which he is. If a man gets hopelessly in
debt there he may as well make up his
| mind that he will have to pass the balance
: of his days on the island unless he strikes
It rich and is able to settle with his cred
itors.

Mr. O'Connell's old pastor. Just as the
reverend father's last words were pro
nounced. President J. A. Thompson of
the Bohemian Club stepped forward and
with expressive sincerity said:
"There are many of us present who are
not content to take a last look at our
departed friend without an attempt to
express the thoughts that rise in our
hearts and fill our souls on this solemn
occasion. For the first time in our lives
we are In sadness and grief and in down
heartedness with Daniel O'Connell. It
would seem as if to us and to those for
whom I speak he was singularly the gift
of an All Wise Creator to lift our hearts
and our souls out of the rut and routine
of our daily lives. With gifts of imagina
tion and fancy, with earnestness of pur
and spirit of comradeship, ho has
been for twenty-seven years supreme in
our midst as one of the most loving, one
of the most encouraging, one of the most
friendly of men. Let us hope, under a
beneficent Providence., that he is amid the
fields and flowers and songs he loved so
well and that we may join him there. Let
my cluing- words be: 'Pan", let love en
dure aXter death:' "
And all that Is mortal of Dan O'Connell
was laid at rest.

DIVORCE NOT REQUISITEâ W. M.
| S., Pope's Valley, Cal. It is not requisite
; that a wife should sue her husband for

MAJORITY AND PLURALITYâ A..
! French Camp, Cal. A majority of votes
i is more than one-half of the whole num
ber cast. Plurality in United States poli
tics is the number by which the votes
! cast for the candidate who receives the
j greatest number exceed the votes cast for
the candidate who receives the next
greatest number, when there are more
I than two candidates and no one candidate
receives a "majority. If Brown receives
I 5000 votes, Jones 4000 and Robinson 3000 i
neither has a majority of the 12,000 votes i
cast, but Brown has a plurality of 1000
over Jones. In most of the States of the
Union a plurality elects, but in Connecti
cut and Rhode Island, if no candidate
(as for Governor) fails to receive a ma

SMOKINGâ Puffs, Oakland, Cal. The
question, "Is it improper for a man to
smoke in the presence of ladies or of a
lady?" is one that has been the subject
of a great deai of discussion. There are
many who contend that it is highly Im
.proper to smoke in the presence of the
fair sex; there are many who half believe
that it is improper, yet they smoke all the
. same when in the presence of a lady or
of ladies, and there are a great many who
neither know nor care whether it is prop
er or not. Possibly the best answer was
that given by a lady when asked by a
gentleman who was about to light a cigar
if smoking was offensive to her. It was:
"I do not know, for no gentleman ever
smoked in my presence."

PERSONAL PROPERTY
OF NATIONAL BANKS
NOT A SUBJECT OF TAXATION
BY THE STATE.
Important Decision by the United
States Circuit Court of the
Northern District of
California.
National banks are not liable to State
taxation on personal property belonging
to them. Such is the gist of a decision
handed down yesterday by Judge de
Haven, sitting in the United States Cir
cuit Court.
The decision was in the case of the
City and County of San Francisco against
the" Crocker- Woolworth National Bank of
San Francisco, to recover $7,734 64 taxes
and interest alleged to be due by the bank
for the year 18S6 on personal property.
The bank interposed a demurrer to the
complaint, setting up the contention that
personal property of national banks Is
not a subject of taxation by the State.
Judge de Haven's decision sustains the
demurrer and gives judgment for the de
fendant with costs.
In passing upon the demurrer the court
said that Congress has declared that the
real property of national banks shall be
subject to State, county and municipal
taxation, and that the shares in any
such association shall be assessed as other
personal property to the owner or holder
of such shares. The effect of the statute
Is to exempt personal property belonging
to national banks from direct assessment
and taxation by the Stateâ that Is. per
sonal property cannot be directly assess
ed to them by the State for the purpose
of taxation.

Restaurateur's

Daughter. ;
MRS. CHRISTINA KRONE CALD-
M'ELL is an heiress. She has just
come into the money of Captain
Oliver H. Baker, and thereby hangs
a tale of an old man's admiration and his
gratitude to a young woman who respect
ed age and paid' it the courtesy ever due it.
A little more than two years ago Mrs.
Caldwell. who was then Miss Krone, was
cashier in her father's restaurant, "The
Popular." an eating house on Geary
street. Captain Baker came to "The Pop
ular" to take his meals and was attracted
by the quiet dignity of the young cashier.
Her respectful courtesy and attention en
listed the sympathy of the seafaring man
and he soon'leamed that his restaurateur' 3
daughter was engaged to be married to a
young man of limited means, but a lack
of means made the wedding day a dis
tant possibility.
"Marry." said the captain, "and I will
fit you up a home, where you may reside
reÂ»nt free. The only favor I ask in return
is that you let me come and live with you

as a boarder, for which I will pay you a
handsome price."
Christina Krone and Howard Caldwell
were married and Captain Baker went to
live -with them. About two weeks ago
the seafaring man was taken ill, and
when the serious nature of his malady
was explained to him he asked that At
torney Nagle be summoned to draw his
Captain Baker died on the 21st lnst.
When his last will was opened it was
found that Mrs. Caldwell was the solÂ©
legatee.
The estate is valued at over $2o,jiÂ». and
consists of $15,0^0 in bank. $3000 in life in
surance, some United States bonds vari
ous mortgages and the home where Mrs.
Caldwell lives.
Howard Caldwell, the husband of the
fortunate young wpman, is a driver for
the California Casket Company. As far
as the Caldwells know Captain Baker fafcs
no living relatives.
Jumped His Bonds.
'Louis Feroni, a bootblack, failed to ap-
pear before acting Police Judge Barry
yesterday and his bonds of $500 were de
clared forfeited and a warrant âas is
sued for his arrest. He was charged with
assault with a deadly weapon by cutting
Antone Pettonatti with a knife on Jan
uary 17. There was very little evidence
against him and the case would probably
have been dismissed. The bonds are
good.
The Early Races.
One of tho most interesting lectures In

ROW BREWING
IN THE RANKS
OF POPULISTS
Charges Made of Mis
use of Funds.
A SUIT SOON TO BE FILED
PURITY OF ELECTIONS COMMIT- ;
TEE IS ACCUSED.
j
Interesting Disclosures Are Expected ;
to Result From Taking the Mat
ter Into Court â Obtained
Money From Phelan.
A row of large proportions and one ]
which promises some interesting develop- i
ments is brewing in the ranks of the
Populists of San Francisco. In fact, the
row has been under way for some time
past and is now approaching a critical
stage. It all started over the fight for ,
the control of the party machinery and
a suit which, it is authoritatively stated,
will be filed In the Superior Court within j
the next ten days is likely to be the me
dium of a series of exposures of the
methods of certain Populist leaders, and
even men outside the party, which will
greatly surprise the rank and file of that
political organization and the public gen- j
erally.
The suit referred to will be directed at ;
the purity of the elections committee of J
the People's Party, demanding an ac- '
counting of the funds intrusted to its j
care during the recent campaign. The |
members of this committee are A. B. ;
Kinne, G. D. Gillespie, B. J. Pie. Henry j
Huppert and M. Meakin. It is charged i
that the campaign fund was misapplied
and an accounting will be demanded. In
support of the proposed petition the men
who are back of the suit claim they are
In possession of evidence that will not
only prove that the members of the com
mittee were false to their trust in the
expenditure of the money, but that they
played into the hands of the Democrats
for a cash consideration.
Mayor Phelan' is one of those who are i
alleged to have contributed good hard
money in order to secure the support of j
the accused Populists, and it is further j
charged that the Mayor is at present en- :
gaged in an effort to secure control of j
the party machinery for the furtherance
of his political ambition. Phelan, so the j
kickers say, already controls the execu- '
tive committee and by reason of this fact j
charges tiled with that body against the |
purity of the elections committee have re
ceived little consideration. That body
did appoint a sub-committee a short time
ago to investigate the charges and its
conclusions were contained In majority
and minority reports which were consid- !
ered by the executive committee at its j
meeting last â¢ Tuesday night. The out- j
come of the matter was a whitewash for i
th? accused committeemen.
According to its report filed with Regis- â 
trar of Elections, the committee collected
and expended during the campaign about !
$1900. It is charged that they in reality ;
collected a much larger sum, and . the j
Populists who make the charges of crook- j
edness want to know what became of the '
surplus. Not only that, but they want '
to know by what authority the members
of the committee paid themselves nice fat
salaries out of the money contributed for i
campaign purposes. Phelan ,it is said,
contributed directly $150. and an equal
amount through Charles F. Fay. The
â¢contribution from the latter is credited '
to F. Fay. but this is regarded as a blind.
The Mayor, it is claimed, made a bar
gain with Kline and Gillespie previous to
the nominating convention by which they
need their influence to secure his indorse
ment by the Populists. In return he I
promised to allow Kinne to retain his po^ !
sition as Health Inspector, and this prom- j
ise has been made good. There ' are j
broad hints of more enticing bait being
thrown out by candidates and grabbed by
the purity of elections committeemen.

SALUTES BETWEEN BOATS.
Old Days When Steam Whist-ing i
Was Intend d as an Insult.
In IS3O pongs for the engine room
â¢were unknown, and In many of the
boats, when the pilot was in his house
(if there was one) or on the deck over
the engine room, he would signal the
engineer by the strokes of a stick or j
cane upon the floor of the house or t
deck. All boats, of course, carried j
bells, and by them all notices of de- I
parture ar.d of arriving were made â 
known, and all salutes between boats
were given by their bells. To blow
steam, as is now done by a whistle,
was intended to be a challenge or an
insult.
In July. 1*37, the first steam launch,
the Sweetheart, thirty-five feet in
length, four feet three inches of beam
and three f..Â«et depth, engine 4x12 '
Incuett, wheels three feet sfx inches in !
diameter, and boiler horizontal fire
tubular, designed and constructed at |
the United States navy yard. New !
York, by the writer, then chief engi
neer of the navy, was completed, and,
on her trial and succeeding trips
around the city of New York, was sa- !
luted with the bells of passing stoam- I
boats ami Lheered by people who rushed !
to the ends of the- piers to witness the j
novel sight. She attained a speed of !
eight and a half miles per hour. The '
engine was subsequently transferred to
the United States naval school at An.
napolis.
Fuel, up to the year 1536, was wholly !
pine wood, though up to that time some
owners of steamboats commenced ex- j
perimenting upon the practicability of j
using anthracite coal. A steamboat on \
her route of six or more hours could
not have the capacity in her fireroom '
to contain all the wood required, and
was compelled to pile it upon her side
houses; and such boats as were on a j
long route, as from New York to Provi
dence, were compelled to invade their
upper deck with wood, and upon leav
ing the city had somewhat the sem
blance of a floating wood yard.
In 1839 anthracite coal was Intro
duced in the furnaces of the steamboat
North America, plying on the Hudson
River between New York and Albany,
and, to aid its combustion, when a high
pressure of steam was required, a fan
blower, driven by a belt from the wheel
shaft was resorted to, but soon after
ward' a small independent engine was
used, connected by a belt to the blower.
Anthracite coal was soon afterward
burned without auxiliary draught in
the open furnace of a steam boiler.

How to be Rich in 1000 Years.
Much amusement has been caused In
: Birmingham by the arrival of a check
| for Â£10 at the Lord Mayor's office under
the following circumstances:
A few weeks ago it was decided to ac
( quire land upon which to extend the
i Council House. The site could not be
! got freehold, but a 999 years' lease was
j given. To this Alderman Mariton object
i ed and pleaded that at the end of the
i lease the buildings would revert to the
'â  ground landlord, and Â£5.000,000 in ground
rent would have been spent in vain.
Mr. Alexander Chance accordingly sent
; a Â£10 check to the Lord Mayor, to be in
! vested for 999 years at 2V> per cent. At
! the end of the period this would yield
Â£58 5m.000.000, or an Income yearly of
j Â£200 000.000. This sum Mr. Chance wag
-1 gishly suggested would recoup Birming
-1 ham "for the sum expended on ground
rent.
When interviewed. Mr. Chance said he
was quite serious. "When the time
comes," he said, "there will be no rates
to pay. and every citizen will live in a
suburban villa provided and lighted by
the municipality."â London Mail.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1899.
NEW WEATHER PROPHET
FOR PACIFIC COAST
Professor W. H. Hammon Resigns His Office.
PROFESSOR W. H. HAMMON, Forecaster of the local Weather Bureau,
has resigned his position. He did so in order to accept a more
remunerati%-e position as assistant manager of the Philadelphia
Company, an electric light and power concern located at Pitts
burg. Pa. Professor Hammon sent his resignation on Thurs
day to Professor Morse, who is at the head of the Weath
er Bureau of the Department of Agriculture at Washington. He hoped
his action would not be made public until the head of the department
had time to appoint his successor. However, bad news travels as rap
idly as the good, and Professor Hammon's contemplated departure from
the scenes of his past usefulness could not remain a secret long.
Professor Hammon has presided over. the local weather bureau for many
years, and so faithfully has he applied himself to his duties and so care
fully have all his reports been prepared that he is highly regarded by
hundreds of men in all walks of life. His is a position that is difficult to
fill, the eccentricities of California weather puzzling the shrewdest scien
tists. During his long service here even the most exacting have had little
of which to complain, and his timely warnings have saved thousands of dol
lars to {he farming and commercial interests of the coast.
Shortly after the present weather prophet came to this city he amused
many people by flying Kites, but the wisdom of his experiments was dem
onstrated after a while by his reports relative to the upper currents of the
air which have much influence upon the local climate. They make possible
intelligent reports of what may be expected in the line of storm and calm,
moisture and dryness. For a long time Professor Hammon endeavored to
have a signal station established on the top of Mount Tamalpais. tind his
efforts were finally rewarded by an appropriation for that purpose. This
station has since been invaluable to the department.
It is not likely that his successor will be known for some time, and Pro
fessor Hammon will continue to keep tab on the weather from his place in
the Mills building until the new man is aecustoiried to his duties and has
had time to benefit himself from the incumbent's knowledge of the West.
This is one of the most important stations in the T'nlted States, and Pro
fessor Morse has no easy task in finding the right forecaster for the place.
While Professor Hammon has tendered his resignation with reluctance, be
cause of the many ties formed here, the offer of greater remuneration
proved too tempting to be resisted.
CUBAN ASSEMBLY
SOMEWHAT DISGUSTED
Not Satisfied With the Report of the
Commission That Was Sent
to Washington.
HAVANA, Feb. 25.â The Cuban As
sembly met to-day and heard the re
port of the committee which was sent
to Washington some time since to ccm
fer with the Government regarding Cv-
ban affairs.
The Assembly was clearly dissatisfied
with the doings of the committee, inas
much as its members had not acted in
accord _one day telling the President
that the Cuban army was composed of
30 000 men and the next that it con
sisted of 45,000 men in the Cuban ranks.
" The commission presented a report on
the conference vtth General Alger. Sec
retary c-f War, and the Attorney Gen
eral but failed to lessen the Assembly s
apparent feeling of disgust. It was fin
ally decided to have the report printed
and to hand a copy of it to each mem
ber of the Assembly, that they might
study it carefully. The fact that $3,000,
--000 on a basis of $100 for each soldier
was adopted, and that efforts to ob
tain more failed, makes obligatory the
Assembly's ratification of the accept-
General Gomez did not attend the
meeting, neither did he send a repre
sentative or a message. The next meet
ing of the Assembly will be held on
Monday. ,

MANY COAL MINES
MAY SOON BE CLOSED
Over Four Thousand Miners Involved
in a Strike That Is Now
Threatened.
FORT SMITH. Ark., Feb. - 25.â Every
coal mine in Arkansas and the Indian
Territory will be closed down next
Wednesday If the present programme of
miners and operators Is adhered to.
Over 4000 miners are Involved and mines
suDDlying a large section of the south
west with fuel will be affected. A coal
famine Is sure to follow, as the supply
on hand is small and will be speedily ex
hausted. Already railroads are confiscat
ing every car of coal that comes on their
track and are keeping It for their own
use Private dealers have been notified
that they can get no more coal until the
trouble Is settled. The situation is the
nio.Â«t alarming that has existed In the
coal region in years.
The operators refuse positively to con
sider the miners' scale and met to-day to
declare that if their demands are not ac
ceded to by next Wednesday a general
strike will be declared.

taken out of the dock at Mare Island j
Thursday and will be ready for service in
about a month. Many changes conducive '
to the comfort of officers and crew havo j
been made, and she will be a. commodious i
vessel when she leaves the yard. Com â¢ !

Naval Constructor Baxter to-day super- '

Davis and the revenue cutter Bear. The I
work was quite difficult, owing to the
danger of straining the light frames of
the torpedo boat, but she was landed on !
the sawdust-packed keel blocks as easily '
as could be imagined. When she comes
off her place probably will be taken by j
her sister boat, the Fox. which is abnut j
ready to leave the Wolff & Zwicker works !

The Bear will get a general overhauling

FIVE STRAIGHT DEFEATS.
Stanford Varsity Baseball Team ;
Playing in Hard Luck.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 25.â
The Stanford Varsity met its fifth defeat
this season in the game with the Santa
Clara College nine, played on the campus j
this afternoon. The match was the most I
exciting of the year, the score being 5 to
4. The visitors played uphill ball for eight
innings. They did not "go to pieces," how
ever, and in the last inning brought in
three runs, which won the game.
In some respects, the performance of
the varsity was the best of the season.
Fewer errors were made than in any pre
vious game, and the batting was particu
larly heavy. Nine base hits, a couple ot
two-baggers and two three-base hits is a !
record which shows decided improvement
with the stick.
Carson pitched the nine innings through
for the varsity. He was somewhat un
steady, but showed good head work, and I
kept his hits scattered. Kelley and Nihil,
the Santa Clara twlrlers, had excellent
control, neither walking a single man.

CONSUL DARNALL
DEMANDS A SCALP
Warring Officials at
Nogales.
SERIOUS ACCUSATIONS MADE
FIGHT HAS BEEN CARRIED TO
WASHINGTON.
Collector of Customs Chenoweth
Charged With Having Been
Too Thrifty While in
Office.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NOGALES, Ariz., Feb. 25.â A very
pretty fight is on here between the
American Consul at Nogales, Sonora,
Mexico, James F. Darnall of Indiana,
and the Collector of Customs at No
gales, Ariz., H. K. Chenoweth, and the
contest has been carried to Washington,
where it is intimated Consul Darnall,
who is very influential, has preferred
serious charges against Collector Chen
oweth, with the avowed intention of
getting the political scalp of that treas
ury official.
It is alleged that some weeks ago a
fraudulent affidavit against Consul
Darnall was concocted in the office of
the Collector of Customs for the United
States at Nogales. This alleged affi
davit is said to have charged Consul
Darnall with having fraudulently is
sued to a Chinese a certificate of right
to return to the United States, for
which he was alleged to have been
paid $100. The affiant purported to be
a Chinese, who alleged he had paid
Consul Darnall the money to get him
to cross a Celestial friend from Mexico
into the United States.
This affidavit was forwarded to the
State Department at Washington and
Consul Darnall was asked to explain.
He looked up the affiant and obtained
from him a counter affidavit to the ef
fect that he had not knowingly exe
cuted an affidavit against Consul Dar
nall. He further alleged that he had
been taken to the American custom
house by Collector Chenoweth, the sec
retary of the latter, Eugene Sykes, and
Charles Meehan, Chinese Inspector, and
told that unless he signed certain pa
pers submitted to him he would be de
ported. He signed, supposing he was
following a necessary procedure in his
own case to prevent deportation. Con
sul Darnall forwarded to the State De
partment this later and true affidavit
of the Chinese and he received in re
turn a full and complete exoneration.
But the blood of the Hoosier Consul
was now at a fever heat, and he de
termined to have the scalp of Collec
tor Chenoweth. First, he took in hand
E. S. Stokes, special agent of the
Treasury Department, and accused
him point blank of guilty knowledge
and concealment of a very corrupt
state of affairs in the custom house, al
leging that Mrs. Chenoweth, wife of
the Collector, a Mexican woman of no
business ability whatever, was drawing
$100 a month as cashier of the custom
house, and had never rendered one mo
ment's service; that Judge Eb. Wil
liams, Chenoweth's political mentor,
had been drawing a salary as deputy
statistical clerk, without giving a day's
service; that Professor O. L. Lewis,
principal of the Nogales public school,
had drawn*a salary as janitor at the
custom house without doing a day's
work: that before Lewis went upon the
payroll one J. L. Hunter, a professional
bully, especially imported from Crip
ple Creek by Collector Chenoweth to
"do up" his political enemies, had
signed the vouchers as janitor and
drawn the salary without ever doing
any work, the necessary sweeping and
cleaning having been done by Robert
Catlett, a mounted inspector, who was
supposed to be riding along the inter
national boundary on the lookout for
smugglers.
Special Agent Stokes at once called
in Special Inspector T. J. Roush. and
the two proceeded to an official in
vestigation of the Nogales custom
house, finding all the above allegations
to be true. The special inspector in
terviewed Professor Lewis and fricht
ened that gentleman into making a
confession, supporting his statement
with an affidavit. Lewis, who is a very
honest young man, and a distant rela
tive of Chenoweth. swore that he had
been requested by Chenoweth to quali
fy as janitor. He objected on the
ground that he could not attend to the
duties. Chenoweth replied that that
would make no difference â it was sim
ply a matter of form. So he took the
oath of office, and at the end of a
month signed a salary voucher, but
never received either check or money
for the alleged service he had not ren
dered.
The affidavit of Professor Lewis has
been forwarded to the Treasury De
partment, and it is rumored that Con
sul Darnall has laid the matter before
the President, through the State De
partment. The town is agog over the
sensation, and nothing else is talked
about.
INTERESTS THE PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Opposition to the Blair Bill May Pre
vent Los Angeles From Getting
an Appropriation.
WASHINGTON. Feb. 25.â The House
Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds held a meeting this morning.
;im' when Representative Hilborn asked
that the bill providing an appropriation
of $250,000 for an addition to the Los Ar.
geles postofflee be reported favorably the
members of the committee showed oppo
sition to the bill on the ground that Rep
resentative Barlow of the Los Angeles
district opposed the other public building
bills during their recent consideration in
the House. The bill was temporarily laid
aside.
Representative Barlow said to The Call
correspondent to-night: "The only mem
ber of the Committee on Public Buildings
opposed to the Los Angeles fcuilding bill
is Representative Hilborn. He thinks that
a f^orable report to the House on this
measure will jeopardize the chancss of
his Oakland bill. Everybody knows the
receipts of the Los Angeles office will
more than double those of Oakland, and
of course we are more entitled to a build-
In* than the town opposite San Francisco.
Tlio latter does nine-tenths of Oakland's
business. â¢
â¢â¢The story of my opposing bills re
ported by the House Committee on Pub
lic Buildings is ridiculous, as the record
will prove. I voted against the bill giv
ing Blair, Nebr., a public building, be
cause the receipts of the postofflee and
the size of the place did not warant it,
but I have never opposed the erection of
a public building in any town entitled to
one. Los Angeles needs an addition to
the present building, because it is a large
city and is rapidly growing. Despite tho
opposition of Representative Hilborn, I
think if the Public Buildings Committee
is given another day for the considera
tion of the bill Los Angeles will have
what it Is entitled to. as Chairman Mercer
has assured both Senator White and my
self of his hearty support."
In justice to Hilborn. it must be said
that he not only denies Barlow's charge
but declares he did all he could for the
bill's passage, and that its failure may be

STANFORD'S DEBATING
TEAM IS CHOSEN
Students Who Will Match Oratory
and Logic With Berkeley-
Speakers.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 25.
T-The final debate for the selection of
the team which will represent Stanford
in the intercollegiate debate to be held
in April in San Francisco was held in
the chapel this evening and resulted in
the choice of J. E. Springer, Anthony
H. Suzzallo, '99, and James Ferguson,
'99. Carl T. Hayden, '00, was picked
for alternate.
The honor of representing the cardi
nal on the rostrum was contested to
night by eleven men, who had won
places in the series of preliminary de
bates which took place last month. The
contest showed great improvement over
previous debates, both in matter and
in form.
The team selected to-night is made
up of experienced debaters. Springer
and Suzzallo were on the Carno.t debate
this year and each made a good show
ing. Ferguson was a member of last
year's intercollegiate team. J. E.
Springer gajned his experience in the
University of lowa, being on its de
bating team. He entered Stanford last
fall with junior standing. His major
is economics. Anthony H. Suzzallo
hails from San Jose. He is a senior in
the education department and has be
come proficient in forensics since enter
ing college. James Ferguson, the third
member of the team, is also an educa
tion major. He is logical and per
suasive. He hails from Mayfield. Carl
T. Hayden, alternate, comes from
Tempe, Ariz. He was a member of this
year's Camot team.
Professor H. B. Lathrop presided to
night. The judges were Judge Lind
ley of San Francisco and Professors
Howard and Green.
M!SS LUTZONE WILL
NOT BE ARRESTED
District Attorney Mclsaac Intimates
That Perjury Was Committed
by Mrs. Young's Witnesses.
SAN RAFAEL. Feb. 25.â Not only has
District Attorney Mclsaac refused to per
mit the warrant sworn to by J. J. Daly,
charging Mlss Matilda Lutzone of Tiburon
with perjury, to be served, but he boldly
asserts that the warrant jvas issued to
gratify the spite of Mrs. Young and that
If perjury was committed it was probably
by the witnesses for the defense. He
further makes public his belief that one
reason why so desperate an attempt has
been made to besmirch the character of
the leading witness for the prosecution
is a desire to permit the return of Henry
Young-, who "Jumped" his ball and fled
the country prior to his preliminary ex
amination on the charge of arson.
"It is my intention, said Mclsaac to
day, "to permit no warrants to be served
on felony charges unless I am first con
sulted. It not only permits the county
to be put to a great expense, but to one
that is needless as a general rule. I
shall investigate the character of the evi
dence against Miss Lutzone and if it is
not stronger than that introduced at the
trial of Mrs. Young she shall not be ar
rested. I consider this a rather peculiar
proceeding on the part of the defense.
In the first place it probably was taken
to gratify the resentment and spite of
Mrs. Young; afr; In. it may have been
done with the kfea of permitting Young
himself to return in comparative safety.
If any perjury was committed, it is my
belief that it was by certain witnesses
for the defense and not by Miss Lut
zone."

I Loud and Senator White have been on

j The Call correspondent that there was

! this instance.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 25.â There was general
1 rejoicing among business men ana citi
zens to-day when it became known that
Senators White and Perkins had sue
ceeded in getting a $48,000 appropriation
in the river and harbor bill for deepen
ing and improving Alviso channel. For
a number of years futile efforts have
been made to get Congress interested in
the work. Shipping by Alviso has been
steadily increasing, and the steamer Una
there has been the means of greatly re
ducing freight rates. A month ago the
Good Government League requested Sen
ators White and Perkins and Congress
man Loud to exert themselves for the im
provement of the channel. A few days
ago the Senators notiflea the organization
that they would do what they could. This
was verified to-day. The league this af
ternoon adopted resolutions thanking
White and Perkins for the interest taken.

New Rupture Cure
Marvelous Effect 'of a System That
Heals Perfectly.
Citizen of Paoli, Ind., Tries the Plan
With Wonderful Success.
Considerable local Interest has been aroused
at Paoli, Ind.. by the recent cure of the rup-
ture of W. T. Moon, a prominent citizen of
that locality. Heretofore rupture has been.con-
MR. W. T. MOON. Paoll. Ind.
sidered an incurable malady. There are hun-
dreds of different, styles of trusses, but as they
only aim to hold the rupture, the popular be-
lief that rupture cannot be . cured Is probably
firmly' fixed. . . . ' . -
In Adams, N. V., a well known specialist of
that pretty â¢ town has devised ! a method that
combines to securely hold a rupture within the
abdominal cavity and it also has the virtue to
cause the opening or "ring." as it is called, to
firmly grow together. â ' He sent the 'system to
Mr. Moon, this pentleman having previously
written to the doctor for advice. Â«. A number of
Mr. Moon's neighbors were deeply interested
In the outcome of 1 the test and sure enough
as the doctor predicted. â¢in a few weeks the
opening was healed and the rupture cured so
completely as to give no sign that there ever
had been a rupture. As it was a bad case
and a severe test the entire neighborhood was
convinced and quite a number of ruptured peo-
pie have since recovered. Mr. Moon declares
the system a marvel. It is the discovery of
I? r - W S. Rice. 418 E. Main St.. Adams. N. Y.
To all people ho are ruptured or have "friends
so afflicted, the doctor will mall free an Illus-
trated book that tally describes his home cure
for rupture.. Write for it. Do Mi at once
since to know that there is a permanent cure
for rupture W L" renew the hope of many men
and women > who are now despairing under th*
mistaken belief that, they cannot be cured.

RODE THE BRAKEBEAM
ACROSS THE CONTINENT
OAKLAND. Feb. 25.â A bright, intelligent, youthful face, tanned to a
nut brown from exposure, looked up imploringly into the kindly counte
nance of Judge Ogden this morning, pleading not to be sent to Whittfcr
Reform School. The owner of the face was John Osborne. aged 16 years,
who had left his home at 127 East One Hundred and Twenty-fourth street,
New York, last October, and had been tramping it across the continent,
riding brakebeams and in freight cars, finally reaching, as he supposed,
the land of sunshine, flowers und plenty. Unfortunately, he did not know
that Constables too were plenty in California and worked under a fee
m. As his big honest eyes looked up to the Judge, young Osborne
ftal4:
"I had been :n Berkeley only three hours when I was arrested as a
vagrant. Aftor serving three days in jail there I went to Emeryville.
Inside of two hours I was again nabbed by a Constable, because I asked
for a pair of old shoes. I offered to work for the shoes. But the Con
stable was pretty good to me. He fed me and gave me about 50 cents
altogether. I do not want to go to the Industrial School. I prefer to learn
a rr;uie and work."
The lad's story touched his Honor's heart and Judge Ogden decided to
try at leaat to communicate with the boy's uncle, or father, who is a litho
grapher in Xfw York. Osborne says he has an uncle living in San FrÂ»n
cisco named William Stanbridge. but could not find him.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1899.
MRS. HAWLEY`S
WILL HAS BEEN
DECLARED BOGUS
Judge Hall Denies Its
Probate.
ANOTHER SENSATION SPRUNG!
WITNESSES SIGNED TWO WEEKS ;
AFTER HER DEATH.
Finale in the Contest Over the
$30,000 Estate of a Woman
Who Is Supposed to Have
Committed Suicide.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. Feb. 25.
There was a decided sensation in Judge
Hall's court to-day when the alleged will
of the late Mary F. Hawley, offered for
probate, was declared invalid, to the great j
surprise of 11. M. Barstow, attorney for
Will Q Hawkett, special administrator Of
the estate.
The matter has been replete with sensa- j
tions that have been exploited In The Call |
from time to time.
Mrs. Hawley died on September 7, 1597.
from what was supposed to be a self-in
flicted wound. The shot was fired in the I
night time when she was beside her hus- ;
band in bed. It was afterward claimed
that she had been previously ill and men- ;
tally deranged. She left property located i
at Napa. producing an annual income of :
S3OOO, and her entire estate is valued at <
$30,000.
A will alleged to have been executed
in San Rafael, in 1895, was produced and
filed for probate, and on petition of \\ U
liam Hawley, the widower, his friend. >
"Will G. Hawkett. was appointed special |
administrator. This will bequeathed the j
entire estate to Hawley, the husband, and :
was witnessed ostensibly by William
Kane and his wife. Lizzie Kane.
Mrs. Hawley had left three brothers, â¢
named Edgington, and a sister. Mrs. R. A. j
Pickett, who immediately prepared con- j
test. It was intimated that perhaps Mr?.
Hawley had been murder.cd. and to sup
port this theory Sheriff Mi Ken*le of â 
Napa was to have been the chief witness.
The contest has been pending over a year,
and now McKenzie is himself charged
with crime, and Hawley has not been seen
for several months.
When the matter of probating the al
leged will came up before Judge Hall to
day, the contestants were represented by
Attorney John T. York. Attorney BWB
-j tow. in his effort to prove the will, called
â  Mr. and Mrs. Ksne. the alleged subscnb- ;
i ing witnesses, aiid fatera came the surprise.
i for both unhesitatingly testified that they j
! had merely signed the document two
'< weeks after Mrs. Hawley* a death, as a j
favor for Mr. Hawley.
The will was therefore declared bogus.
Attorney Barstow wished to testify to his
! innocence in the matter, but Judge Hall
assured him there was no suspicion on '
that score.
Mr< Hawley's estate will now be ad
ministered upon and distributed as
though there was no will, and the con- |
testants and a daughter of a dead sister
will receive a. share.
Incidentally It is jntimated that the i
Grand Jury may take a hand in the mat- j
ter. ____^__â
ONCE MORE CHARGED
WITH MALPRACTICE
DR. J. C. SHARPS VICTIM'S
DYING STATEMENT.
He Shrewdly Persuaded Her to Make
a Written Denial That He Had
Criminally Operated
Upon Her.
OAKLAND. Feb. 2.".â Anna K. Jacob
sen, a domestic, died at tile Lester House
to-night from the effect of a criminal op
eration performed some days ago by the
notorious Dr. J. C. Sharp. The woman
is 27 years of age and has never been
married. Miss Jaco'osen came down from
Suisun Valley a few days ago. She took
t a room at the Lester House, on Eighth
street, and was treated by Dr. Sharp.
She told an acquaintance that the au
thor of her troubles was a farmer near
Suisun, on whose ranch she had been
employed.
After being treated by Dr. Sharp she
developed symptoms of blood poisoning,
and Dj. Frank T. Lamb of San Fran
i isco was called .to the woman. She be
oaase rapidly worse, and as soon as Dr.
Lamb saw that Miss Jacobsen was suf
fering from the result of a criminal ope
ration he consulted with Drs. Fearn and
Derrick of this city. To these doctors
the girl told her pitiful story, and said
that after Sharp had performed an ope
ration he induced her to sign a confes
sion stating that he was not responsible
for the operation and that she had been
treated before she went to him. She told
Drs. Fearn. Derrick and Lamb that this
statement was false, and that she was
forced to give it to Sharp. She said
that he alone- performed the operation and
was responsible for the results.
The doctors informed District Attorney
Alien and Coroner Mehrmann of the facts
and it was decided to arrest Sharp. The
woman's ant^-mortem statement was
made late this afternoon and soon after
she became unconscious and died to-night.
In her statement she accuses Dr.
Sharp, and she told the doctors that
Henry Carpenter Jr., a rancher of Sui
sun Valley, was responsible for her con
dition when she came to Oakland.
Dr. Sharp is the practitioner who was
charged with the murder of Anna John
son a year ago. The evidence on that oc
casion" was conclusive but the prisoner
was saved by a technicality that prevent
ed the admission of the young girl's ante
mortem statement, because it could not
be proved that she had given up all hope
of living. The detectives are seeking
Sharoe. _
One of the curiosities of the Isle of
Mahe. in the Indian Ocean, is the chapel
that is built of coral.

ter to call a special meeting of the Minis
terlftJ Association to petition Governor j
Gage to declare a day of prayer for rain
in this State. In his request Dr. John- !
tt"ii compares California to Nineveh and
says that this State needs to learn a lea
son to-day to avert a threatened judg- 1
ment. "If for the wickedness of them j
that dwell therein," says he, "God turns
a fruitful land into barrenness, Califor
nia may yet become a waste unless the I
people cease from their sins and cail upon j
the merciful heaven by prayer. More than j
this, as in the sight of God the cities are j
generally tho most sinful portions of our j
State, how fit and morally beautiful i
would it be if San Francisco and other
citi. s, in response to the call of their j
Mayors, should declare a fast day for the
purpose of having the parched earth re
viv a."
The Rev. Dr. Coyle does not view kindly
the proposition to call a special meeting j
to petition Governor Gage. Dr. Coyle iaya
that Dr. Johnston's views are an indt- I
vldual matter, and something he does not â¢
car.' to discuss.
The Rev. C. H. Hobart believes that
such a thir.g would be entirely proper, i
He say*: "Yes. I believe we ought to pray !
tor rain and also repent of our sins, to j
make it reasonable for God to give it to
us. A State that could seriously contem- j
plate sending Dan Burns to Washington
does not deserve rainâ no, not even dew.
But God is good and often gives us much
more than we deserve."
The Rev. C. M. Hill of the Tenth Ave
nue Baptist Church doubts the propriety i
of involving political agencies in such a
matter, and believes that each Christian
should pray for hims-lf.
Rector F. J. Mynard says he has been :
using the Episcopal prayer for rain for
r 1 weeks and rather favors the idea.
The Rev. J. S. McDonald. Dr. Coyle's
assistant pastor, has had some experience
In this direction. "During the beginning i
of the drought last year when I was con- !
ducting meetings' in Solano County I se- i
cured a general meeting of the churches j
and we had special prayer for rain and !
rain fell, but hardly enough to save the ;
' 'tlh-' Rev. J. \V. Phillips believes in j
praying for rain and differs from those who
believe that these matters are governed
by flxod laws. He does not believe that ,
tne Lord has established any laws that
he cannot repeal or suspend. On Monday j
the Oakland clergy will meet but it is
hardly likely that they will take any ac- j
tion In the matter.
COLLEGE MEN PLAY
FIREMAN'S FUND TEAM
University of California Baseball
Team Wins After a Closely
Contest-d Game.
BERKELEY, Feb. 25.â Once more the
University of California has carried off
the honors of the diamond. This time it
was against the Fireman's Fund team
from San Francisco. The two teams met
this afternoon upon the college campus
for the second time this season, California
winning by a score of 10 to 7.
Both sides showed up well, better by
far than in the last game a week ago.
Corbett Is working a marked improvement
in the college men. This is seen at its
best advantage, perhaps, in Kaarsburg s
Ditching, which quite excelled anything
that he has done before. Maclaren all
round played the college men's star game.
His fielding was quite above the ordinary-
For a time at the beginning it seemed
the home team would have everything
its own way. the score having reached
10 to 2- in their favor. But by a grand
stroke of luck the Fireman's Fund men
made five runs in the sixth Inning, bring
ing their total up to that given in the
foregoing. _
A Pre-Election Disagreement.
\LAIIEDA, Feb. 25.â An effort will be
made by Attorney R. B. Tappan to pre
vent the City Clerk placing the designa
tion "Municipal League on the official
ballot after the names of the nominees
of that party. Clerk Lamborn has stated
that he will designate the candidates ac
cording to the conventions nominating
them. Mr. Tappan says if he attempts
to carry out his intention he will apply
to the Superior Court for a writ of pro
hibition on the ground that the Municipal
I eague is not a recognized political or
ganization under the law, not having
polled 3 per cent of the total vote cast at
the last city election. The League was
not in existence at that time. Mr. Tap
nan says he is not acting in the interest
of any party or candidate and is only act
uated by a desire to have the election
conducted strictly within the letter of the
iaw. _______________

CATARRH OF THE STOMACH.
A Pleasant. Simple, but Sat: and Ef-
â  fectual Cure fcr It.
Catarrh of stomach has long been con-
sidered the next thing to incurable. The
usual symptoms are a full or bloating
sensation after eating, accompanied some-
times with sour or watery risings, a for-
mation of gases; causing pressure on the
heart and lungs and difficult breathing;
headaches, fickle appetite, nervousness
and a general played out. languid feeling.
There Is often a foul taste In the mouth.
coated tongue and if the interior of the j
stomach could be seen it would show a
slimy, inflamed condition.
The cure of this common and obstinate
trouble is found in a treatment which
causes the food to be readily, thoroughly
digested before it has time to ferment )
and irritate the delicate mucous Furfaces
of the stomach. To secure a prompt and
healthy digestion is the one necessary ;
thing to do and when, normal digestion is
secured the catarrhal condition will have :
disappeared.
According to Dr. Harlanson the safest
and best treatment is to use after each [
meal a tablet, composed of Diastase, Asep-
tic Pepsin, a little N'ux, Golden Seal and
fruit acids. These tablets can now be found '
at all drugstores under the name of Stu- '
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, and not being a ]
patent medicine can be used with perfect
safety and assurance that healthy appe- I
tite and thorough digestion will follow j
their regular use after meats.
Mr. N. J. Booher of 2710 Dearborn st.,
Chicago, II!.. writes: "Catarrh Is a local
condition resulting from a neglected cold â 
In the head, whereby the lining membrane
of the nose becomes inflamed and the |
poisonous discharge therefrom pass- \
ing backward into the throat reaches ;
the stomach, thus producing ca- |
tarrh of the stomach. Medical au- ;
thorities prescribed for me for three '
years for catarrh of the stomach without
cure, but to-day I am the happiest of men :
after using only one box of Stuart's Dys-
pepsia Tablets. I cannot find appropriate ;
words to express my good feeling. I have ;
found flesh, appetite and sound rest from
their use."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets is the safest
preparation as well as the simplest and >
most "convenient remedy for any form of :
Indigestion, catarrh of the stomach, bil- j
iousness, sour stomach, heartburn and '
bloating after meals. â¢ '
Send for little book, mailed free, on
stomach troubles, by addressing Stuart
Co., Marshall. Mich. The tablets can be

LAWCZYNSKI'S DUPE
WANTS A DIVORCE
Wife of the Bogus Nobleman
Anxious to Regain Her
Freedom.
Within the next week there will be
filed in the County Clerk's office a suit
for separation that will recall the me
teoric visit to this city of a fictitious
Russian Count, his engagement to a
weli-known lady resident, their hasty
marriage and his ignominious flight
with his wife's money and jewelry.
The plaintiff in the interesting action
will be Mrs. Teofll de Lawczynski, bet-
ter known as Mrs. H. L. Fabry, the
widow of the well-known liquor mer
chant who was accidentally asphyxi
ated by gas in August, 1897. The man
fmm whom she wants to be divorced
paraded while here as a member of the
Russian nobility, but who, according to
the best authority, was nothing more
than a clever scoundrel who preyed on
defenseless women and sympathetic
people of means. The grounds upon
which the plaintiff will demand a sepa
tion are desertion and non-support.
The alleged nobleman is at present so
journing in the capitals of Europe,
where he is said to be plying his ne
farious vocation with indifferent suc
cess.
The history of the defendant, the
manner in which he inveigled the lady
who at present bears his name into
marriage, and the daring manner In
which he gained funds for his own sup
port, make % interesting reading.
Lawczynski, or, as he w r as sometimes
known, Kierzicki. was first heard of in
this country in Chicago in the early

part of 1896. At that time he only pos
sessed the title of doctor, and was not
loth to dub himself as such, having a
slight knowledge of medicine. In ad
dition to his native tongue he spoke
excellent English and was conversant
with Italian and French. His knowl
edge of medicine led him to try an
original scheme which netted him hun
dreds of dollars.
It was his plan to stop In front of a
handsome residence and swallow
enough laudanum to give the impres
sion that he was seeking to end. his
life. By frothing at the mouth and
various other practiced arts he suc
ceeded in making those who found him
believe he was dying. Out of sym
pathy they would generally carry him
into their luxurious homes and tele
phone for a physician. Before the ar
rival of medical aid the clever rascal
would so far recover as to be able to
tell a pitiful story of destitution. His
intelligent appearance and suffering
would often so move his listeners that
he would be sent away with a substan
tial present to tide him over trhat he
represented to be temporary distress.
His practices soon became notorious,
and, Chicago becoming too hot for him,
he fled to pastures nevy. Unfortunately
California was chosen as his new iield
of operations. Beginning in the south
ern portion of the State, he gradually
worked hi 3 way up to this city.
Lawczynski's first attempt at de
ception in this State was tried in Santa
Monica. The man with the unpro
nouncable name faked suicide in front
of the residence of Senator John P.
Jones in that town. He was taken into
the Senator's residence, given medical
treatment and then made his ufeaai plea
for money, but it is not known how he
fared on that occasion. His next known
attempt was in this city, but his ef
forts did not avail him much, as he was
sent hustling out to the French Hos
pital, where he recovered in remarkably
quick time.
While in San Francisco he made a j
shabby genteel appearance and made
his headquarters at the Oberon, where
he posed as a scion of nobility. Quite
a number of people believed in him,
while a majority set him down as a j
fraud. His appearance was not in his
favor. His clothes and linen were not
of the best, and many people were un
kind enough to call him a cheap waiter.
Some good friend (?) of Mrs. Fabry,
believing Lawczynski's claim to the
title of Count was a just one, intro
duced him to her, and a quick engage
ment and a speedier marriage resulted.
The Count labored under a delusion
when he married the handsome young
widow. He thought she and her -child
had inherited thousands of dollars
from her first husband, and he
set his wires to gain possession of
the fortune. He paid rapid court to
Mrs. Fabry and within two weeks after
their engagement he secured a mar-
riage license, and on the Ist of March,
1898, the couple were united by Judge j
J. V. Coffey at the residence of the i
bride's mother, Mrs. A. yon Gerzabek,
605 Steiner street. The wedding was a
quiet affair, only the immediate friends
of the bride's family and the Count be
ing present.
The mother of the bride was not im
pressed with either the Count or his
title and strenuously opposed the |
match, but her opposition was over
ruled. Failing in her efforts to prevent
her daughter's sacrifice, she took the
Count aside and told him what she
thought of him and informed him that |
he would have to leave her house and |
show whether he was capable of sup
porting her daughter.
The thought of work alarmed the
Count, and he told his wife a plausible
tale about his practice in Chicago need
ing his attention and begged her to ac
company him to the Windy City. But j
for the strenuous objection of the
mother, the Countess might have gone.
As it was, the guileless young wifi*
handed over to her scheming husband j
nearly five hundred dollars and all her
jewelry, and he started on his tour and I
never returned. He was heard of I
through his short stop in Chicago, i
where he visited his wife's relativos j
and borrowed a large sum of money j

JOHN JU. AGAIN IN TOWN.
The Ex-Champion Boxer's Vaude-
ville Company Opens at the
Comedy.
Once more the stage at the Comedy
Theater is creaking with the weight of
the only John L. Sullivan. The ex
world's rhaxnpion arrived in town with a
vaudeville and comedy aggregation,
which made its first appearance last even-
ing. To criticize the performance would
be a harder job than Knocking out John
L. or his boxing partner, Jake Kilrain,
also an ox-champion. John L.'s histrionic
ability can be described in stock market
phrase as "nominal and unchanged." He
is Bigger and his hair is whiter than when
he last appeared before his numerous ad
mirers in the "West. He is still popular
with the lickle hero worshiper, which will
go a long way to make his stay profitable.
Of course the show has to conclude with
a sparring match, and Sullivan and Kil
rain do a short turn. The audience pay
the price of admission to see the star, and
no disappointment is expressed because
there is no blood spilled.
Concerning the comedy and vaudeville
artists nothing could be said. The proof
rf-ader would not permit the expressions
necessary to fittingly describe the show.
Any one suffering from that tired feeling
can increase the seriousness of the attack
by sitting through some of the numbers
â¢n the programme. Still, there are some
good features, and many people will find
the show tolerably interesting.

FATAL PISTOL
DUEL BETWEEN
HIGHBINDERS
One Man Killed and
One Wounded.
FIGHT ON THE SIDEWALK
LIVES OF MANY ENDANGERED
BY THE SHOOTING.
Si On Sear and Bing On Tongs at
War Over a Small Amount of
Money Owed to a
Woman.
Trouble between the Si On Sear and the
Bing On tongs, which started over a week
ago. resulted last night in a pistol duel
in which seven or eight men from the
two tongs took a hand. Pon Hung, a tai
lor, belonging to the SI On Sears, was
killed, and Way Yum Hung was severely
wounded in both hands. The latter was
arrested by Lieutenant Price and charged
with the murder of Pun Hung.
The shooting was one of the cruel and
apparently unprovoked episodes that ren
der the Chinese quarter a place of dan
ger and creates wonder that the inno
cent tourist and the passer-by should es
cape the pistol of the highbinder.
At half-past 8 last night, or within a
few moments of that time, five shots were
heard on Jackson street, near Dupont.
Both thoroughfares were crowded with
the usual Saturday night throng, mostly
Chinese, with a sprinkling of sightseers.
A block below a mission band was beat
ing a warning drum, and the members
were stepping to the front in rotation to
say "I'm glad to-night," etc.
When the shots rang out everbody start
ed toward the cornor excepting the Chi
nese themselves. They stood about, stolid
as blocks of wood. Police were quickly
on the scene. They hustled and scattered
the curious spectators. "Move on," they
said. "It's nothing- but a dead China
man." Such was the case. A Chinese
was prone upon the sidewalk, lifeless.
There is a steep incline at the spot where
he had fallen, and from hi 6 body, trick
ling down the pavement of Jackson street,
was a stream of red.
"Move on, gentlemen," said the police,
accentuating the counsel by divers shoves
and punches. Of the tragedy which had
occurred the average spectator knew only
that which he saw. Soon the Morgue
wagon rolled up and the body was taken
away. Business was resumed, and the
shuffling feet of the Chinese quickly ob
literated the visible signs of crime. Still,
a block below, the drum beat at intervals,
and the voice of the mission worker was
heard to repeat, "I'm glad to-night."
There wore several white witnesses to
the shooting, and all of these agree that
more men were implicated in the duel than
the dead man and the one under arrest.
Way Yum Hung denied that he shot Pon
Hung, and states that the bullet which
killed, the Chinaman came from the pistol
of some one else. It is certain that there
were two shots fired other than those
fired by Way and Pon. THe pistol of the
latter contained two cartridges which
had been discharged, while from that of
the former but one shot had oeen fired.
While Way protests his innocence, Lieu
tenant Price is positive that he is the
guilty man. After the shooting Way
threw away his pistol and ran down
Jackson street to Dupont where he was
captured by Lieutenant Price and Ned
McLaughlln, who pluckily ran to the as
sistance of the police.
Trouble over a small amount of money
owed to a woman was the original cause
of the shooting. Some time ago a mem
ber of the Bing On Tong was detained at
the house of Ah You on account of $4 he
owed one of the inmates. One of his
friends finally paid the amount due, and
several days later other members of the
Bing Ons entered the house and stole
some clothing belonging to a son of Ah
You, who is a member of the Si On Sears.
Ah You notified the latter tong of the out
rage, and yesterday a delegation from the
tong visited the Bing Ons and demanded
satisfaction. The Bing Ons agreed to
pay for the stolen clothes, but asked for
time. The Si On Sear men said that they
must have the money immediately and
declared that if it was not forthcoming
by 8 o'clock last night they would send
out their fighting men and begin to shoot.
The money was not paid, and at half-past
8 the highbinders met in front of the
store at 708 Jackson street and the due!
took place.
Pon Hung was shot in the right eye
and died almost instantly. Way Yum
Hung received two bullet wounds. One
ball entered his left hand near the wrist,
plowed through the palm of the hand, cut
off the third finger and lodged in the
knuckle of the second finger. The other
bullet struck him in the left hand, in
flicting a slight wound. From the nature
of the wounds the doctors are of the

opinion that he must have made an at
tempt to take the pistol away from hia
assailant. He was treated at the City
Receiving Hospital, and was afterward
locked up at the Central police station.
Besides being a member of the Bins Ons
the prisoner also belongs to the W'ah Hing
Tong. All of the men who took part in
the duel are Sam Yups.

FLED ON THE
EVE OF HIS
WEDDING DAY
"Billy" Levy Deserted
His Fiancee.
HIS WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN
MISS EDITH WHITE NOW CON-
GRATTJLATES HERSELF.
Blames Her Lover's Father for Break-
ing Off the Match Owing to a
Difference in Religious
Belief.
Behind the mysterious disappearance of
"Billy" Levy, a popular young man about
town and prospective heir of his wealthy
father, Abraham Levy, the Sansome
street real estate dealer, is an interesting
romance that deals with a story of
thwarted love. It is alleged that Levy
was engaged to wed Miss Edith White,
a pretty maiden of 21 summers, who re
sides with the family of Policeman Mc-
Namara, at 1925 Fillmore street. The
wedding was to have taken place the day
following Levy's sudden departure a
month or more ago. Whether young Levy
left the city and his prospective bride of
his own volition is not known, but the
friends of the young lady assert that
Levy's family induce^ him to go away
in order to prevent his marriage with a
girl outside of his faith.
The young couple were lovers for a
long time and were seemingly devoted to
each other. They made all preparations
to celebrate their marriage in a befitting
manner. Miss White announced her in
tended union with young Levy to her cir
cle of friends and relatives and was the
recipient of many beautiful wedding gifts
from wealthy relatives in Ntw York.
The news that her intended had left the
city never to return on the eve of their
marriage almost prostrated Miss White.
She believed that her lover had been spir
ited away by a cruel father, but she lived
in the hope that he would write to her
explaining his unexpected departure to
her satisfaction. Weeks have passed and
the would-be benedict has not written a
line to the girl he vowed to wed. Levy's
present whereabouts is unknown to his
many friends about town. His father
stated yesterday that he did not know
whither his son had flown.
Miss White is now inclined to take the
matter philosophically. She was very re
luctant to make a statement concerning
the disappearance of her intended hus
band, but when it was suggested that
Levy had left town of his own accord she
became very indignant. As she told the
story of their unrealized dream of bliss
ful love a spirit of resentment toward
Levy's father gleamed in her hazel eyes.
and she emphasized every bitter word
with a haughty shake of her head.
"Yes. Mr. Levy and I were to have been
married on the Sunday following his sud
den disappearance," she said. "I loved
him then and he loved me, and I am ab
solutely certain that no power on earth
save the wrath of his father could induce
him to leave the city under the circum
stances. I have now lost all regard for
him. 1 only loved him because he seemed
so fond of me, and I thought he was en
dowed with a manly spirit. After he pro
posed to me I told him to tell his folks
about it. I advised him to consult with
his father, and he promised me faithfully
he would do so. He seemed to apprehend
trouble, and more than once he told me
his folks might object to his marriage
with me on account of the difference in
our religion.
"About three months before the date set
for the marriage I asked him to tell his
father. I told him I would not marry him
unless his parents were satisfied. He said
he knew his father's sentiments on the
subject of members of the Jewish faith
marrying Christians were well defined. He
was strongly opposed to a marriage of
that sort. I then suggested that we break
the engagement, but Billy would not lis
ten to such a suggestion.
"Finally I induced Billy to break thÂ«
news to his folks. That was about a week
before the day we were to have been mar
ried. That night he came to the house.
He was nervous and excited. I asked him
what had happened and he refused to tell
me. I guessed the trouble and tried to
console him. We left the house together
and went to the residence of the rabbi
who was to have performed the marriag"
ceremony. Billy seemed ill at ease, but I
did not think that he was contemplating
sudden flight. If he had only given me
one hint of the result of his interview
with his folks I would have broken the
engagement instantly. I had no desire to
be a disturbing element in the Levy fam
ily, and I told Billy often that I would
not marry him unless he secured the con
sent of his parents. As Billy kissed me
good-night he said, 'Edith, do you trust

"That was the last time I saw him. The
next evening I repelved a telephone mes
sage from one of his friends telling me
that he had left town and had no Inten

moment, but from that time my love for
the man died. I have no desire to say
harsh things about Mr. Levy or his fam
ily nor have I any intention of bringing
a breach of promise suit. I rather thank

CHIMES OF MINSTRELSY
ECHO ON THE IOWA

The Battleship's Crew Entertains
Hundreds of Guests in Begal
Fashion.
Two hundred guests, leaving care be

evening and enjoyed the quips and jests of
merry minstrels for two hours. The affair
was given In honor of Mayor Phelan, by
the crew of the battleship, in return fur
his entertainment of the gallant jackies
at the Orpheum last week. Under the
forward gun, which poured out tire and
shot at Santiago, the guests were seated.
Those of the crew not on the programme
perched themselves on the high turret,
while some ventured out on the long bar
rels, constituting themselves regulation
gallery gods. The entire forward deck
was covered and walled with canvas, the
stage being in the bows. The footlight

GERTRUDE ATHERTON
Gertrude Atherton says women think more than men do, because
they have more time tor" thought.. This makes them keener observers.
It explains why woman's point of view is often so widely divergent
from that of man. Lately Mrs. Atherton has been studying the United
States Senate from the visitors' gallery.- She has reached the conclu
sion that collectively and in its component parts it is highly mter-
Every Senator is invested in the public mind with the toga and
halo of Senatorial dignity. Mrs. Atherton has cast these aside and
looked at the real manâ always from the standpoint of the gallery,
which is that of the public. She passes the men whose names are
household words in review and notes their characteristics in the pass
ing. They are her views, to be sure, but they are decidedly analytic.
In lit!i cewwynntion with mr hr never mentioned party. She -talked
of men, purposes and principles. *
What Mrs. Atherton says is distinctly feminine. She is not
schooled in the game of politics. She says Senator Davis is the
Senate's clearest thinker, because that is what her judgment tells after
comparative study. In her analysis she omits the names of several of
those whom the public considers among the chief notables, but that
makes what she says all the more interesting. . Guided judgment is
seldom worth while. It is time for congratulation when criticism
rings true.
A great editor once said that the Senate was always interesting.
Mrs. Atherton shows it is, and that much of interest is lost through
the dry-ds-dust methods of viewing the Senate that are generally in
vogue. No man has ever thought the Senate interesting from the
standpoint of its bald heads, and Mrs. Atherton gives Senators Jones
and Stewart a brand new title when she calls them Father Christmases.
It is merry, but true, and when the shaft of truth is tipped -with mer
riment it splits the willow wand of impression io twain.
* * *
Special to The Sunday Call.
THE Senate is the gene-sis of dignified disorder that never reaches
chaos. When you look down from the gallery you are not
quite sure in your mind whether the" Senators are in session,
until you see Mr. Hobart bring his gavel down in a very
orderly way to command silence. If you have been in the
House and heard Speaker Reed hammer his desk and bellow for
order you are amazed at the contrast, until you see the effect is about
the same â very little comes of it.
Then you fall to studying the heads of the Senatorsâ the bald
heads. They are so interestingâ a regular symphony in pink, white,
brown and yellow. There are those dear old Father Christmases,
Senator Jones and Senator Stewart, whispering together, and their
heads are as pink as can be. Senator Perkins' head looks as if it had
the jaundice. Senator Hoar is one of the pink ones, and there are
others of varied hues.
After awhile you forget about that and fall to wondering why
It is that in a body of men of that sort no Senator seems to pay any
attention to the one who is speaking. While the debate on the peace
treaty was in progress Senator Bacon had the floorâ one Senator was
holding a levee in another part of the chamber, others were talking
-mong themselves, and still others reading. Every once in a while
Mr. Hobait would rap for order. He was the only one who paid
Senator Bacon's speech was masterly. I think he is the best
â¢ speaker in the Senate. In the gallery where I was every person
listened intently. ' Down below Senator Hoar would jump up now
and then and talk to some one or walk around. He is a lovely old
man but he can't keep still two minutes at a time.
r am really at a loss to know how the Senators keep in touch
â with the proceedings. Of course they are not as disorderly as the
House That is a regular bear garden, and Speaker Reed has to be
severe just as when the ayes and noes are being taken he thrusts
his gavel toward one after the other of the members, seeming to say:
"You you you," in a rgular bulldog way.
Sometimes I have seen the effect of criticism by one Senator seem
to fall flat because the man who ought to hear what was being said
was absent. During one of the debates Senator Mason spoke in
criticism of Senator Hawley. Most people get mad gradually, but
Senator Mason doesn't. He just bounces, all at once. That day he
was in a terrific rage, and roared and stormed tremendously about
Senator Hawley.
â¢ Just as he had finished the Senator came into the chamber. He
had not heard a word except the last sentence or two. Senator
Hawley is a dignified little man, and when Senator Mason sat down
be addressed Mr. Hobart in his impressive way and said: "I am in
formed that the Senator from Illinois has been indulging in criticism
cf my remarks. I would like him to understand that my criticism
was not of him personally, but of the principles he advocates."
Senator Mason had learned by that time that Mr. Hawley hadn't
heard him. Of course the effect of his speech was lost on Mr. Haw
ley, and more than that it could not be effective if made over for
Mr.' Hawley's benefit unless it was delivered in just the same way
and tone. Any other man I ever saw would have been discouraged,
but Senator Mason wasn't. He simply got mad all over again and
at once and stormed at Mr. Hawley precisely as he did before. I
never heard anything so funny. But then Mr. Mason is the standing
joke of the Senate. Every organization of that sort has a jester,
you know.
The more you study and compare the Senators, the more posi
*tive is your conviction that Senator Davis has the best mind. In
saying that I mean that he is the clearest thinker. He arrives at
his conclusions quickly, and yet he always knows why he thinks as
he does. He seems to be a master of his subject, and if he makes
an assertion it is sure to be well grounded. He is nut gifted in
oratory,, like Senator Daniel, but Senator Daniel is frothy. Senator
Davis does not think of the well-rounded periods, but the fact.
Senator Daniel's speeches are more smooth and flowing, but when
you analyze them they lack stamina. I think Senator Bacon more
nearly combines polish and fact than almost any of the Senators.
Senator Hoar is a very good speaker, too, and impressive â when he
isn't jumping around.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1899.
The one thing that -?raSTre%H~Borne in on me, too, as I have
listened to the Senators talk, is that they are in earnest. I had
really supposed that they were not actuated by principle, but I think
with hardly an exception they are men of worthy purpose, according
to their lights. I have watched them now for some weeks in the
Senate chamber and met most of them socially, and the better I
really know these men the stronger is my conviction that they are
honest.
Take Senator Perkins, for instance. I have been at his home
town, Oroville, and I know he is popular there. The people think
everything of him. Still I came to Washington really believing he
was all sorts of dreadful things. I never was more surprised in my
life in a man. On this treaty question he was among the antis in
opinion, but he said to me: "Mrs. Atherton, the people I represent
want that treaty ratified. Personally I am not in favor of it, but I
told those people when I -was elected to the Senate that when they
wanted me to do anything I would do it, and lam going to. There
isn't a Senator who, when seeking election, would dare stand up
before his constituents and tell them he'd do what he pleased re
gardless of the wishes of the majority. I say he has no right after
he has been elected to vote contrary to their wishes."
Now I'm not for expansion. I don't think I want expansion. But
I can't help thinking that Senator Perkins' attitude is more creditable
than the position taken by the other California Senator, Mr. White.
Then again, I said to Senator Perkins one day: "Senator, what
in the world do you want to do this sort of thing for when with all
your money you could travel all over the world?"
'Why, Mrs. Atherton," he said, "to be a United States Senator
is the crowning honor of a man's life. There's nothing more honor
able. We all think that."
I am satisfie I he voiced the opinion of all the Senators. Each
in his own way acts as if he thought that. And no one need tell me
that men who feel that way are corrupt. I don't believe it.
They're not.
There is all this talk about Senator Hanna. Now the fact is
that man's personal record is spotless. Twice he has started in
business on borrowed capital, and to-day I am told by ever so many
people who are in a position to know that he could borrow untold
sums and not even have to give any bond for their return.
It seems to me that such facts as these give the lie to the cry
that the Senators as a whole are corrupt. It is impossible that a
body of men of this sort should lead such a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde
exigence. Naturally many of the things they do are not approved
of, but that they do the best they can according to their lights I am
thoroughly convinced.
The dignity of the Senate cannot be questioned, although the
degree is rather comparative than superlative. I think that the
Senators are inclined to be rather cold to people, because every one
asks favors of them. In the chamber there is, as I have said, an
entire absence of the order one would naturally look for in such a
body, but I think they constantly feel the dignity of their positions
+in the world and act in accordance with what seems to them to be
the proper line of conduct. All you want to do to convince yourself
that the Senators are dignified is to go over to the House.
I told Mr. Reed the other day that I thought Mr. Hobart kept
very much better order than he did. "He ought to," said Mr. Reed.
"I have a most unruly body of men to look after. The Senators
are quiet."
I should think they were unruly. And besides that they have no
idea of decorum in the House. Why, during a most important debate
in the House one day I saw one of the well-known members leave
his seat go behind one of the screens, lie down on a couch, light a
cigar, and then calmly go off to sleep. I thought it was very con
siderate of him to have a screen.
Socially Washington is the most crude place I ever saw. The
custom of continual calls is a perfect bore. People have been as
nice to me here as can be, but it is the ways I object to. In other
social centers you are not bored to death in society but entertained.
Unless you have done something to make you notable no one ever
thinks of giving an entertainment for you or anything of that sort.
The result is that the people bore you to death, and you feel an irre
sistible desire to run away f.om them.
A young Englishman of high birth and standing whom I knew
in London came to see me not long ago and said he was going back
homeâ he was disgusted with Washington.
"When I went to New York and Boston," he said, "I had letters
of introduction to people, and do you know, why they had something
or other on for me every day. I began to think I was a good deal of
a fellow. Then I came here with letters of introduction to the best
people, and no one has even given a dinner for me. I am bored to
death and going home."
I told him the exact truth. The town reeks with notabilities.
There are the Senators and the Embassadors and goodness knows
what not. The social market is glutted with distinction. The result
is that no one has a really good time in society, because they are
tired to death with the procession of calls and keeping up with the
notables.
Now in New York and London no one ever thinks of paying formal
calls in the social season. When you go anywhere you go with the
idea of stopping an hour or so and being entertained. You don't go
out to be bored, nor do you ca/e to suffer martyrdom at your home.
That is why I say Washington itself is socially crude. It is too
ponderous and sacrificing. It needs a new system in its society.18
ARCHBISHOP IRELAND WHO HAT BRING BACK A CARDINAL'S HAT FROM ROME
No Member of His Church, Gere or Layman, Is a More Typical Repreentatlve of American Catholicism in Iff Mcst Liberal Phases Than Is the Archbishop of St. Paul, Who" Is Now Vis ting the Pope in Rome.
The man oi the hour among American Catholics is John Ireland, the elo
quent Archbishop of St. Paul. He is now visiting Rome, -where he was
cordially received by Leo XIII, who has more than once shown his con
â¢ . fldence in Archbishop Ireland's judgment regarding ecclesiastical ques
tions in this country. Some friends of the distinguished American
churchman are predicting that the red hat waits him in the near future.
Here is an interesting character study of the priest and the man.
Special to The Sunday Call.
St. Paul, Minn., Feb. 22.
JOHN IRELAND, Archbishop of the
diocese of St. Paul, now on a visit
to Rome, is regarded as one of the
intellectual giants of America. He
passed his sixtieth birthday on tho
11th of last September, but both
mentally and physically appears to be in
the prime of life. His hair is iron gray,
but the casual observer would not guess
his age at more than 48.
In this community, where he has done
most of his church work, he has been rec
,,pnJzed as a man of ideas for nearly
thirty years. His colonization schemes
early branded him as a man of originali
ty, and his later aggressive methods of
pushing the "Faribault school plan"
gained for him the admiration and in
many cases the indorsement of thinking
men of two continents. He is perhaps the
most liberal minded of the leading Cath
olic clergy of the United States, and it is
a common remark that the Catholics of
this archiepiscopal see are the best edu
cated in the country.
Archbishop Ireland's Residence.
The Archbishop lives in one of the beau
ty spots of the city of St. Paul. HiÃ house
is located at the corner of Leslie umi
Portland avenues, two blocks north of
Summit avenue, said to be one of the
three most charming drives in America.
In this home he spends most of his time
. when in the city. His life there is as sim
ple and unostentatious as it is possible to
â make it. He arises regularly every morn
ing at 5 o'clock, and the two hours from
that time until 7 he employs in the devo
tions common to his church. At half
past 7 he breakfasts with the members of
his household.
He is a man of great personal magnet-
THE EVILS OF ANGLO-WORSHIP
By Mrs. Burton Harrisor).
THE period Is easily within the
memory of the present genera
tion when our country people
ceased to be the sort of good
Americans who when they died
went to Paris. The rapid movement
of that series of marriages which trans
lated so many of our simple maidens in
their flowerâ not to speak of the well
dowered widows â into peeresses of
Great Britain accomplished the diver
sion of our social idolatry to England.
In New York is the influence of this
great cult most visible and continu
ing. But it has spread all over this
continent, where the farther away one
gets from New York the more one ob
serves a curious interest in tlje achieve
ments of our society performers. It is
only a faint and frigid interest the la
dies who read these columns at three
days' distance from their fountain head
will take in the marriage of a fash
ionable belle of Gotham with a for
eigner of title, unless he be a subject of
the Queen.
In the crepuscular days of Anglo wor
ship among us, husbands and wiveÃ
went to church together every Sunday
morning arm in arm, attended by a
Noah's ark procession of their young.
On all public occasions the lord was
seen beside (not in the wake of) his
wife, and, whether he felt so or not,
he did not deem it his duty to Fashion
to look bored.
A couple of married lovers were not
disconcerted at being found together
by callers, or at being met far from
the haunts of men seeking each other's
society undisturbed.
A young unmarried man who vis
ited at their homes was usually given
over for entertainment to the girls of
the family. If there were no girls he
usually stayed away, unless bidden for
dinner or a dance.
The offspring of pious Episcopalian,
Presbyterian or Baptist families, who
had come to the front as heads of the
community, would have been shocked
beyond measure at the horrid Image of
a young wife habitually receiving visits
alone from an admirer, even of the
Platonic order of friends. Nor would
the youthful matron have dreamed of
giving the public reason for calling this
exotic appendage of a household her
especial property.
Then echoes sounding from the othei
side announced that many of the great
ladles of England who had come to be
the models of their republican sisters
were no longer seen in public with
their lords except on occasions of th*
most exacting ceremony. Suppose a
New York girl who had made a great
marriage in the British aristocracy re~
turning to her native city, and when
surrounded by her particular chums,

"cavalry" order. It is keen and clever,
but never flippant. He puts everybody
within hearing "on edge. 4 " and sends all
to their day's work Jn cheerful mood.
The breakfast hour over he retires to
his study, runs over the morning pa-pers,
summons his secretary and b-?Rins the
labors of the day. Right here becomes
evident his startling grasp of every sub
ject from church to charity, from paro
chial school to seminary. His corre
spondence indicates that he gives the
plaint of the poorest woman in St. Paul
as painstaking attention as the appeal of
the Bishop of North Dakota on a matter
of church polity. His hours from 9 o'clock
to noon are spent in his study. His very
voluminous corespondence out of the way

which dinner is served, and at 2 o'clock

Here all the priests of the see of St.
Paul who have grievances or who wish
orders, suggestions or instructions are ex

character is ever trairsacte"d at the home

from 2 to 4. and at 5 o'clock the distin

to his devotions. The evening meal is
served shortly after *5. and the hours

PARABLE OF THE PEARL
"The kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchantman, seeking goodly pearls: who, when he
had found on% pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it. Matt.
xiii; 4-5, Jf.6.
IF we wonder how it was that this
jewel should have cast the epell of
its splendor over thÂ» eye and heart
of the humble artisan, some hint
may lie in the intimations we pos-
sess that this was the time for what
may be called a carnival of pearls
among the masters of the worldâ "the
singular and only jewels," Pliny says,
"and nature's wonder." They were
wearing them then, not alone in carca
nets and on coronets, but on their very
sandals.
It may be mentioned also as a bit of
(curious treasure-trove, which hdds an
j other gleam for me and for my purpose
! here, that among the dreams and specu
lations of those times, touching the
I origin of the jewel, these may have lain
f among the folk-lore to which the boy
would listen: That the pearl was born
of the dew from heaven, gathered into
one peerless globe falling through the
sunshine oT the shadows, to create the
clear or the clouded splendor. Or again,
it was born from an angel's tear falling
from on high, while the rarest and most
beautiful caught their beauty and their
j worth from falling athwart a flash of
I lightning in a storm.
These dreams may have reached the
teacher of divine things as he listened
i to the talk at the fireside or in the mar
ket place, and may lie among the rea
sons or the guesses when we wonder
why he takes the pearl for a symbol of
the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven
in our human life and lot.
â¢ â¢ â¢
There is a truth at the heart of the
symbol, in its creation. We learn from
the masters of our modern time that
the primal reasons for the wonder may
be traced to a grain of flint which has
invaded the close-encrustihg shell and
stabbed the delicate creature, down
there in the deeps, so that from its
own life the ichor flows for help and
protection against the hurt, covering
the flint slowly, but surely, and round
ing to the pearl. Or, they say. It is a
parasite with which the creature must
do battle by encasing the invader, fold
on fold, and then dying; but there is
the jewel born of the battle. And again
that it comes from the frustrated
promise of another lifeâ a promise
which can never be made good; but
the frustration finally grows to the
pearl. And the poet sings:
So the poor shellfish of the Indian Sea
Lies seven years sick of its sore malady.
Its pearl elaborates In the unresting main,
In worth proportioned to the creature's
pain.
Until in rosy luster, perfect grown,
It comes to light as worthy of a crown.
May we not blend the imaginations
of the old time with the revelation of
the new? For the truth I would touch,
in some poor fashion, is of the myster
ies which we can never fathom, yet
must ever ponder, while we also have
to suffer the Impact of the flints, to
fight the parasites, and to meet the
frustrations of lifeâ the great and
beautiful mystery, to me, of the way
some noble treasures may be won for
the world's life and our own through
the flints of circumstances, the slaying
of some dear hope and joy, and the
angel's tear falling athwart the bolt
in the old imagination; the shining
treasure which may not and cannot be
won through ease and pleasantness and
the wealth of a good which knows of
no heart's bruise, no sore invasion of
our life in the shell of this human tab
ernacle, no blighted hope and no sore
burden; but by these, rather, and
through them, the jewel brought fortb

Glance first toward the nations which
have won the priceless pearl of the
freedom to be men and not mere serfs,
or pawns for the chessboard of kings.
Search their story down to the deeps
and you will always find the flint and
the parasite in the advent of the pearl.
It is the story of- my motherland
through a thousand years. The reason
for the great charter lies there, and for
the great rebellion when the manhood
of England set its foot on the neck of
her king. The finest ichor of that man
hood is the secret of the pearl; and th.3
splendor ryt the jewel marks the burden
cf the pain through which the man
hood must pass to its purpose.
It is the story of that long, stern
strife in the mountains of Switzerland,
when one humble hero was only an in

won the treasure, the hero who gath

the Hollander to be free from the bitter
and base yoke of Spainâ always base

so recently on the fair island to the
southâ when he broke down those great
pea walls he had built as barriers about
the green lands and loved homes, wel

all things else but loss for the excellent
glory of the pearl.
And in the ever glowing passion of
your fathersâ from the coming of the

Just now in the strangling of oppression
at the threshold of our landâ through
all the years, you find the ichor of your
finest life poured out to bring forth the
Jewel.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Do we turn from the nations to the
treasures which have made our life so
rich In these last times, and lifted so
many sore burdens of labor and pain?
I cannot find one of the finest worth
over which men have not poured the
ichor of their life for the pearl when
the pang has struck them.
Turn to what we call the finer arts,
arid we think of men like the creator
of "The Angelus" and "The Sower"â
men of whom the world was not worthy,
doing their noblest work pained by the
flint, pouring their life into the trea
sure, while many a time it was their
fortune to die that the pearl might be
perfected in splendor and noblest
worth; while with some we also re
member that what we call the "for
tune" came to those who open the shell
and clutch the pearl. Or of another
fine soul who. as he lay on his death
bed, said to his friend, "Lift me up";
the picture was his pearl, he would
touch it with one more gleam of ra
diance, and this done he fell on sleep to
awake in the city whose gates, to the
seer's vision, were of pearl, and every
several gate one pearl.
Or, turning tb the treasure that has
come to us in great and noble books
and lives, it is one% more to be aware
of the mystery, the supremacy, of the
kingdom of heaven. Milton, old, blind,
poor and outcast, flashing forth in the
dark encrusting shell the peerless
splendors of the "Paradise Lost" for
a sum the meanest laboring man in
England would despise for day's wages
when you count the days. And Bun

Ing in winter a forlorn looking man came
to his door and asked for a quarter.
Fumbling in his pockets for a minute the
Archbishop brought up 4 twenty-dollar
gold piece, and, handing it to the icllow
with a smile said: "That is a little more
than you need to-night. Take it," use
what you have to, and make the remaind
er the nucleus for the fortune which you
have it in your power to win."

And Robert Burns, tormented by the
pang of the flint, fighting the parasite
or mourning the frustrated hope â for
here all the plagues seem to meet in the
shell of one human life â Robert Burns,
pouring out the ichor of his heart, great

in its tenderness as His heart who
spake the parable; the grandest man of
his time in grand did Scotland, making
his motherland glorious in songs that
stir you like the sound of trumpets on
the eve of great battles, draw you to a
mouse in tender pity, and to his hu
man family with the chords of the man,
to so sweet and true a purpose that,
(if all our great singers and strong and
true, he is to me the sweetest and
strongest, the man above all other men
of our age who was sent from God to
hasten the time
When men to men the world o'er
Shall brothers be for a" that.
And Charles Lamb, turning from his
youth's fair dream of- a maiden peer
less he would some day call "my wife,"
burying his dream in a level grave that
he might make a home for that hapless
sister Mary, through more than forty
years, "in single doubleness"â as he
writes his friendâ this man giving us
the jewel shining with a light that
never lay on land or sea, made precious
by the angel's tear .that fell through
the bolt of doom on the troubled home
of his early manhood,- and the rich and
rare beauty born of the flint.
Shall we turn to the sacred storyâ the
life which holds for us the very light
of this supremacy of heaven and of
God? It is the story which touches the
prophets and saints of all time, and the
things said -and the deeds done in dun
geons, while the headsman was waiting
at the gates. These in all the ages have
given us the pearls of great price
through tribulation and distress, while
to my own heart he sits enthroned of
whom it was written "It pleased him in
whom all fullness dwells to make the
captain of their salvation perfect
through suffering" â the man Christ
Jesus, who bore the cross and despised
the shame that we might possess the
pearl beyond all price, and hold it for
all time.
And I have brooded over the lovely
similitude as memories have touched
me of the many I have known and loved
in all these years, some of them far
away in time and space, and some no
more on earthâ those who had borne
sore burdens bo bravely and so sweetly
that, as the poor human shell wore
away, the pearl phone ever the clearer
through; of those who had fallen on
cad and sore frustration of our human
hope and Joy, but had stood firm by
the white banner of faith â faith In the
supremacy of heaven and of God over
all, and had kept their rank and num
ber to the end and left us the pearl of
great price.
And ever as I have listened to voices
speaking so tenderly of courage and a
patience which seemed to be one with
the patience of God, while the ichor of
their life was enfolding the flint â then
the shadows have seemed to be sweeter
than the light, because of the pearl.
Is it not indeed true, and forever true,
that a treasure can come to us through
this supremacy of heaven in the pearl,
that can never come through the joy
and strength of life? And that the di
vinest truths life can reveal to you and
to me lie within this mystery?

Archbishop Ireland seldom mixes in
political life in the sense of delivering
addresses and making pleas for one party
or the other. He is a man of pronounced
opinions on all State and national topics,
an,d exercises his Influence* in his own
way, but the occasions have been few on
which he felt it his duty to break his rule
of non-interference. One of these occasions
came in the fall of 1896. The campaign
between McKinley and Bryan had only
about three weeks to run and twenty-six
Of the leading business men of St. Paul
sent him a letter asking that he give to
the public in his own way his views re
garding the great questions then before
the citizens of the republic. On October
12 of that year he sent to the country
what was then regarded as one of the
great addresses of the contest which later
ended so overwhelmingly -for McKinley.
A few sentences from that paper will not
be out of place here. Regarding money
he said:
"The question before the people of
America to-day is the coinage of silver
by this country, independently of the
great commercial nations of the world,
at the ratio of 16 to 1. This ratio is the
double of the present commercial value
of silver. The consequences of unlimited
coinage in these circumstances are easily
perceived. The free and unlimited coin

loaned to it. and go on record in the eyes

WHY I AM NOT A VEGETARIAN
By Lawrence Gonlund, M.A.
REALLY the question should be,
why should I be a vegetarian? By
a "vegetarian" I here understand
one who abstains from flesh eating;
he admits to his table milk and
eggs, but no fish.
Now I admit that vegetarians have one
answer, and only one, that deserves an
argument. They give several that are not
at all tenable. Thus they claim that flesh
and fish eating are not at all necessary in
*ny clim.ite, or in any occupation, to
Health and vigor. This authorities deny.
Tho facts seem to be: We find in the veg
etable kingdom the chemical elements
necessary to support life. But many
forms of flesh of animals are far more
nutritious and more easily digested than
the corresponding nitrogenous products
of the vegetable kingdom and these are
the nourishing products, and further, are
those for which man's internal organs are
admirably adapted. Hence in cold and
temperate climates both men leading ac
tive lives and invalids absolutely need
flesh and fish.
Another similar unfounded claim is that
flesh and fish are inimical to the higher
intellectual qualities. This claim is en
tirely baseless.
All the great intellects of the world in
ancient and modern times have been pro
duced by flesh-eating nations. The intel
lectual giants among the Hindoos seem to
be mere myths. A nation, in the very
front rank at present, physically and in
tellectually, is the German people. They
show abnormally good health and they
eat whatever pleases their palates and
their stomachs, and that seems a good
rule to follow, seems indeed to be good
common sense. Anyway the folks who
eat and drink according to artificial rules
will generally be found to be dyspeptics.
And now especially when populations
are Increasing and the exertion by the
nervous system is being more and more
intensified, it would be sheer folly to lim
it the sources from which to draw our
food supplies; it would be a sign of deca
dence, Instead of advance.
On the other hand there is no doubt
that especially here in America we eat
too much meat, that is, well-to-do people
do.
Now we come to the argument which
on the surface seems to have something
in its favor,- which certainly is an amia
ble one,, to wit, that it is unkind to kill
animals for food, that therefore it breeds
cruelty in men, and that a perfect civil
ization could not tolerate butchers in Its
j midst. I certainly have here stated the
] argument in its strongest form, and It
' wi|l he eeen that It will prevent us not
' merely from eating meat and fish but
from using skins for dress and leather
for glovee and boots and shoes.
This .argument can be completely an
swered.
The answer is: The consumer of flesh
and fish jnay feel a perfect conscientious
pleasure in eating them.
Death Is the inevitable termination of
life in every instance in man or animal.
A violent, instantaneous death is probably
the most desirable mod.c for allâ lncluding
man, when we come to see that there is
i no use of repentance for Bins before dying.
The Archbishop wrote and promulgated
this address In the face of the fact that
Thomas D. .O'Brien, a leading member of
his church, was the national Democratic
tomrnitteeman from Minnesota and the
further fact that the Catholics of the
State were for Bryan in the ratio of 3 to 2.
The diocese of St. Paul covers the three
States of Minnesota. North Dakota and
South Dakota. At the head of the prin
cipal see of St. Paul is the Archbishop
himself, without the assistance of a co
adjutor Bishop. Then there are the suf
fragan sees of Winona, Bishop Cotter;
Duluth, Bishop McGolrick; St. Cloud.
Bishop Trobee; South Dakota, Bishop
O'Gorman, and North Dakota, Bishop
Shanley. Bishops Cotter and McGolrick
are now on their way to Rome. During
the absence of the Archbishop his func
tions will be performed by Bishop O'Gor
man.
Founded a Colony.
One of the parly works of Archbishop
Ireland was the founding of a great col
ony in the counties of western central
Minnesota, with Graceville as a center.
He was one of the directors and chief
promoters of the National Colonization
Association. His first colony, made up of
nine hundred Catholic farmers, was sent
to Western Minnesota in 1876. It appear
ed to be such a success that he pur
chased 12.000 acres of land from the old
St. Paul and Pacific Railroad Company.
He continued buying- from year to year
until he had over 32,000 acres.
For this land he contracted to pay the
company $1 25 per acre, and was able to
dispose of it, as a rule, at from $5 to J9
an acre. The matter got into the courts
and was fought for years on the claim by
settlers that the selections made by the
railroad company were invalid on their
face and that it had no right to trans
fer to Archbishop Ireland or anybody else
property in which it had no legal equity.
A. decision was rendered January 20
awarding over 26.000 acres of this land to
Ireland. As there is at this time over $3
an acre profit in this land, it is easy to
figure that the Archbishop is a big finan
cial winner by the latest turn of affairs.
In the Civil War.
Right Rev. John Ireland was born in
Burnchurch, County Kilkenny, Ireland,
September 11, 1838. When he was but a
babe in arms Ms parents removed to St.
Paul, and his early education was re
ceived in the cathedral school. ue was
sent to France in 1853, and in September
of that year, when he was but 15, he en
tered the Petit Semlnaire of Meximeux,
finishing the eight-year course there in
four years. He studied theology at the
Grand Seminalre at Hyeres, returning to
St. Paul in 1861 and being ordained a priest
when he was little more than 23 years nf
age. t'pon the formation of the Fifth
Minnesota Regiment young Ireland was
made its chaplain, and served two years in
the war of the rebellion. Returning from
the field he was appointed rector ot
Cathedral Parish, the central and largest
parish of the city, and continued in that
position until he was named as coadjutor
bishop.
In 1870 he went to Rome as the ac
credited representative of Bishop Grace at
the Vatican Council. In February, 1575,
he was chosen to succeed Bishop O'Gor
man in the vicariate of Nebraska, but
through the efforts of Bishop Grace the
appointment was canceled and he was
then nominated coadjutor bishop of St.
Paul and was consecrated December 21,
1875. Besides the work of Archbishop Ire
land mentioned elsewhere, he was very ac
tive In securing the establishmnt of thÂ«
Catholic University at "Washington, md
on his visit to Rome In 18K7 was engaged,
in conjunction with BisÃop Kean In
drawing a report on this subject for the
Pope. His appointment as Archbishop
dates from 1888.
Hay Be a Cardinal.
There is a pretty general impression
here that he will be made a cardinal be
fore he returns from Rome. When he left
St Paul a few weeks ago, his sister. Mrs.
Justin McCarthy, said to him jocularly:
"You must not return without the red
hat." To which he answered that the
church has honored him sufficiently and
that he would be satisfied to remain in
his present position to the end of his
days.
Accidents, wounds, insufficient at once to
kill,, starvation, chronic diseases, slow
decay of nature, are surely the most to
be dreaded, as causing the greatest
amount of suffering. But the life, enjoyed
by all animals, reared for food, whether
in the poultry yard or In the field, is un
doubtedly a very happy one, happier as a
rule than for man. For no other animal
is existence so easy or may death be so
swift and painless. The Conscientious
mixed feeder should then be aware that
not alone is he the occasion of death to
animals, but he is also promoting life
with all its joys In propagating them for
food, and is thus actually promoting the
happiness of the animal world. As
Sir Henry Thompson says: "The
breeding of animals for food confers
life on millions of beings, possessing con
siderable capacity for enjoyment in their
own way on the best conditions attain
able â superior in point of comfort, free
dom from pain and accidents, to those of
the wild breeds. He confers a life, brief
perhaps, but one well protected. And
when the last hour has come, happily un
foreseen and unsuspected, without the
dread it brings to man. the stroke should
fall instantaneously and without pain.
This can be securedâ is merely a question
of poise."
Could it be conceived that but once a
human dread were visible in the eyes of
a steer, not the coarsest butcher could
finish the stroke?
And when all possible skill and care is
employed, the trade of the butcher will
not be more objectionable than that of thd
surgeon, whom we shall always have
with us.
The Supply of Babies.
It has been computed that about 36,000,
--000 babies are born into the world each
year. The rate of production is, there
fore, about seventy per minute, or mora
than one for every beat of the clock.
With the one-a-second calculation ev
ery reader is familiar, but it is not every
one who stops to calculate what this
means when it comes to a year's supply.
It will, therefore, probably startle a good
many persons to find, on the authority
of a well known statistician, that, could
the infants pf a year be ranged in a line
In cradles, the cradles would extend
around the world.
The same writer looks at the matter in
a more picturesque light. He Imagines
the babies being carried past a given
point in their mother's arms, one by one,
and the procession being kept up night
and day until the last hour in the twelfth
month had passed by. A sufficiently lib
eral rate is allowed, but even in going
past at the rate of twenty a minute, 1200
an hour during the entire year, the re
viewer at his post would nave seen only
the sixth part of the infantile host.
In other words, the babe that had to be
carried when the tramp began would be
able to walk when but a mere fraction
of its comrades had reached the review
er's post,- and when the year's supply of
babies? was drawing to a close there would
be a rear guard, not of infants, but of
romping six-year-old boys and girls.âHow I Tried to Break the Bank at Monte Carlo.

Aside from all question* of principle.
this species of gambling had always
seemed to me unutterably foolish. But
Dame Fortune sometimes resorts to pe
culiar methods of seducing the obsti
nate. Like many another who had
gone before me, I came to scoff and I
remained ttf play. I had looked on for
an hour without having experienced the
slightest temptation to seek my fortune
in this easy way. when I felt some
thing hard on the floor beneath my
foot which proved' to be a louis (54 in
gold).
I announced my find to all the play

It really did seem superfluous to- make

up with them and when men were
throwing them about with absolute
recklessness. However, the louis was.
not mine and I felt a desire to dispose
of it. After very little deliberation I
threw it upon the number 3.
"Messieurs, faites vos jeux," ' called
the croupier, in that measured wav
that is never forgotten by one who has

usual scramble for the last bets, the lit
tle ball commenced it 3 flying journey
and what do you think, it tumbled into
the number 3. If some one had hit me
on the head I don't think I could have
been more stunned. The idea of that
particular louis winning had not been

stopped to reason about it I should not

so easy to make money at this opera

people grinding and slaving and win-,

The manly s- .ty. as I conceive, fs the primary object of,
a true education. I think the cultivation of it is the prime object
of our earthly life. The university rr.an if worthy of his inheritance
as well as of "his manhood, should have it. It will not be deemed un
suitable, I trust, if I say that in my judgment the rules of university
!ife. which call for constant and regular attention to duty, are justi
fied' largely on this ground. Such rules are net in the proper -
of the word arbitrary. They are but the expression of the law of all
manly living.
The gentleman of leisure, even of elegant leisureâ so far as my
observation of the world has extendedâ ls not likely to be of the
highest order of man. Unless bis leisure comes after a long period of
work, and service, in the later resting years of life, he loses always
something of roundness and fullness, in the high moral sense, and
often much of the robustness of manly character. Vacationâ rejoice
in It as we may, when it comes â is not the best part of our living.
The best pan: is the time of working and the time when we are
summoned by the necessities imposed upon us to put forth our most
earnest efforts and to meet the call of an appointed hour.
When I tell you this I do not speak of the college life only, but
of all life Education of manhood dees not come to It 3 end on the
day of graduation. It has its beginning and its first stage before .
that day but it continues until life closes. The reason for rules, if
we call them so. at the beginning, is the same as that f.;r the laws
cf life afterward. The reason for placing them at the beginning is
that the education for what life must inevitably bring nfcst begin ,
in the early period or the man is In danger of never gaining the :
senÂ«e of duty If there is anything in life for which I feel that I have j
r-ason to b-Â» grateful, it is that I have full and pressing work for
every day and that I am obliged to meet appointments and duties.

a man is judged more justly in accordance with what he is than in
the university. The man who has imbibed the spirit of the university
is no respect-: of persons, in the bad sense of the phrase. He does
not look at family descent or early advantages or wealth, but at
mind and character. The externals are only secondary and sub
ordinateâa good, indeed, if the man is worthy of them, but not of
the essence of the man: "What la internal, what the man Is in him

while the bear loves honey It can never be said that he possesses an
equal attraction to others. And here is- where education, and conse
quently college or university life, plays an important part.
Often a man whom circumstances have prevented enjoying the
advantages of education sayÂ»: "I am going to send my boy to col
lege to make a gentleman out of him." The genuine university man
is always a gentleman. Not indeed necessarily in the sense m which
this word is applied to the man of cultured manners and the nicer
refinements of social life, but in the deeper meaning in accordance
with which it justly describes the inner life. â¢ :
ThÂ» gentleman is one who has the spirit of reverence for what
is good, of kindness toward others, ; of gentleness and honor and
self-sacrifice and truth, of obedience to that great command which
bids- us love our neighbor as ourselves. He is one. whose Inward

I am sure that he is a rare citizen of the university community 1
who does not find the influences of the place constantly tending to
give him this noble development, of manhood. A3 he goes forth into
the years of active living and working among men. Yet there are
temptations in all, universities and colleges to forgetfulness in this
matter, which I think should be .kept in view. The member of the -
university is not a school toy, and he ought to lay aside the dis
tinctive characteristics of the school boy, which are meant to be
outgrown when he passes within the university gates. . .

of the winners is not so easy to follow,
â¢but perhaps none the less pathetic.
Under all the glitter and glare the
gayety and life of Monte Carlo there is
a taint of pathos that is very hard to
escape. There are hundreds of old peo
pie here, men and women, who are ha
bitues of the place, slaves to the game,
hosts of withered. old crones who are
ready to fight for a dollar with their
lives; there are young women gorge
ously dressed whom I have neverthe

others who I doubt not would be glad
to have the bread and meat, who wear
silks and costly jewels, yet perhaps are

row it is not Improbable that these
same individuals will dine at the Hotel

the best In the world, and where the
wine card Is marvelous to behold sll

in any event. It owns the hotel and
the Cafe de Paris, which take in most
of the money that is won at the Casino.

expenditures, and it is sometimes neces

Here comes a long'-legrgred, striding
Englishman who amused me a little
while asro inexpressibly.' Corraled in
the garden are a number of Alpine
groats that are naturally the joy of the
children. I was visiting their abode
with a little French girl, who lores to
feed the gentle things, when my ear
was startled by a volley of English
anathemas. Naturally, I peeked around
school of a former period, and which are utterly foreign to that
gentlemanly spirit which should belong- to educated men. -Your true
university .graduate is a man whose prime quality and foundation of
character is manliness â sense of duty so all-controlling- in his
life that he is ready for duty's call whenever and wherever it cornea
to him â that manly. sense of obligation to God and man which puts
work before pleasure and Inspires the soul to meet what is hard or
distasteful with the spirit of a conqueror. He should be minded
and fair-minded in all his search for truth, in all his studies and in
vestigations. The truth should be his light, and the end of his seek
ing should be the perfect light with which no darkness is intermingled.
One, of the moat notable characteristics of the â  university spirit
is that union of the intellectual and emotional elements which keeps
them in due. relation to each other. The tendency of university life
Is almost necessarily toward the Intellectual, and oftentimes toward
the overestimating of this part .. of our nature. The mind at that
period is waking into full self-consciousness, and the man prides him
self upon having within himself that which seems his most ennobling
and glorious possession. .
But on the other hand one of the largest and best elements In
university life is friendship. The life of study moves in the Intel
lectual sphere; but the life of the student reaches out also into quite
a different sphere; and it grows stronger and better because of the
affection which binds- one ?oul to another. N"o man who looks back
upon his university course can fail to see that the association oÂ£
friend with friend moved along with the association of each Individual
with books or teachers In accomplishing the result of the university
career. This element of .friendship^ in the class relationships is ever
bearing witness of the value of the emotional side of the nature. It
gives its constant testimony to the fact that knowledge and intel
lectual power are but paru of the man. and that truth itself is more
clearly seen when the Intellect and the feelings- work in unison.
Truth is oftentimes but dimly seen by the intellect alone. The
man who does not move toward it with his whole nature will not
be sure to find it. He who has no Imagination is not fitted even
for the study of the records of the past. He will become at best an
analyst rather than a historian. He who has no emotion of love for
man" can have no true Idea of the state and the common life, such,
as he ought to have, and no full understanding of the great ques
tions which agitate humanity. â¢ Even the scientist or the mathema
tician Is- but a partial man, until through feeling he enters into the
poetry of his science.

burst came, and there encountered this
harmless looking individual. He was
quite abashed on discovering that he
had been overheard, and proceeded to
apologize profusely.
"Ten see, my chum in England told
me that these goats were mascots," he
said, with a seriousness that was .-
utterably funny. "He told me that I
must never play at roulette without
coming to see these goats. I have come

Poor fellow, as I look at him now he
is fondling -Jiis watchchain, and I think
I can guess what is going through his
mind. The most conspicuous signs in
Monte Carlo are those of the pawn
broker.
Behind the Englishman is a married
couple whom I have encountered a
number of times in my short stay.
"Were I as sure of any number at rou

fortune would-be made. I know that
they are engaged in a very lively

Special to the Sunday Call.
f I \HE general art-loving public of New
I York, or at least that part of it
which passes through Broadway,
I near Madison Square, is divided as
JL'. to the merit of a certain picture
which hangs alone in the window
of an art dealer. The painter is Frederic
Remington, and It is a war picture: It is
one of the first fruits of the Spanish-
American contest in the world of art. The
scene might have been laid In any of the
north New' York parks. The background
is a blue thicket of undergrowth, from
which leads a wide level road. Along this
road, some staggering, some falling and
fomi 1 lying face downward, are a body of
Rough Riders. They have been fired upon
by nn unseen body of ambuscaders. using
the deadly, mysterious, smokeless powder
whir-h gave the Spaniards their chief ad
vp.ntage during the short and bloody con
flict outside Santiago.
It is not the kind of a picture that some
art lovers would like to hang in their
drawing rooms. In some respects, the ;
horror of war which marked the gTeat ;
canvases of Verestchagin, the Russian i
painter, is shown In this work. It exhib- |
its a phase of war that is grewsome. It
is. distinctly unpleasant to contemplate.
The Rough Riders are not using their
â weapons. No smoke hides them from j
view. They stand out clear and distinct
in the wonderful tropical summer atmos
phere.' Surprise and dread are depicted
on their faces as they meet these bullets,
which come apparently from nowhere. It
ie not the purpose of this article to'criti- j
cize Mr. Remington's picture, but merely
to chronicle its appearance. Seventy-five
per cent of those who pass the window
daily stop and look at it. This would |
Beem to indicate that the pictorial side of
the late war appeals strongly to the pub
lic taste. Indeed, the war seems to have
had a marked effect in stimulating Ameri
can artists in the production of military
pictures. The Spanish-American war wiil
certainly live on canvas.
"The Arrest of the Spy."
At the outbreak of the war many fa
mous artists went to Cuba, Among them
were Lyell Carr, Remington, Zugbaum
and Chapman, but by far the most fa
mous painter of war scenes, according to
most critics, was disappointed by the
shortness of the conflict and was left at
home. He is Gilbert Gaul, a distinguished
National Academician. He was waiting
for the fighting to begin around Havana
before leaving his busy studio in this city.
As the war ended with the Santiago cam
paign, he missed one of the great oppor
tunities of Ms life. The public, however, |
will not feel this disappointment as keen
ly as Mr. Gaul does, as he has turned out
since the beginning of the war a number of
remarkable pictures representing stirring
scenes in the conflict. One of his most i
important works is entitled "The Arrest
of the Spy." It depicts a man stripped
of most of his clothing, being searched
by a Bquad of American soldiers and of
ficers. It is instinct with life and ranks
among the most meritorious of this great
painter'B late canvases.
"I expected to go to Cuba," Mr. Gaul
explained to me, "but the war ended too
Boon. I have, however, spent a large
number of my years in making war stud
ies, and this conflict has given an added j
Inspiration to my brush. My spy picture
Is one of my latest. I shall probably paint
other war pictures aa I have been doing
for many years past, and I hope that the
national feeling of patriotism, now so
widespread, will stimulate the purchase
of this kind of patnting. Heretofore, how
ever, pictures of this class, painted by
American artists, have not attained the
appreciation which I believe they have
deserved. They have pleased the public,
but not the collectors and the dealers. A
man who has no collection may buy a
war picture for his only painting, because
he likes it, but you find very few in our
large private collections. I do not believe
that you will find a single war painting
by an .American artist in the Vanderbilt
galleries."
"The Wounded Soldier."
Among the most hopeful of American
artists as to the effect of the war upon
art is Johannes Gelert. the famous sculp
tor of the Haymarket monument in Chi
cago Mr. Gelert, who has recently moved
to this city from the "West, has won addi
tional fame by his great statue of "The
Wounded Soldier." which has already
won one gold medal and recently attract
ed a large measure of praise at the exhi
bition of the National Academy of De-
I found the sculptor the other day
working upon a new war medal in his
studio.
"Do I think that the Spanish-American
war has affected art. I should say that
it had most decidedly. In my opinion it
is an Inspiration such as art In this coun
try has not had since the Civil War. In
sculpture it will have a most beneficial
influence in the way of equestrian and
military statues. The public parks for a
decadeto come will be decorated all over
i his country with the figures of the brave
men who gave up their lives for their na
tion In the year 1896."
"What feature appeals particularly to
you?"
Like the Greek.
"I am giving only a sculptor's idea, but
I should say that it Is the figure of the
. American soldier. He is a different type
from the soldier of any other nation in
the world. He is something like the Greek,
â¢ and partakes of the Goth and the Briton.
yet he differs from all three. To my mind
â he is the Ideal soldier." _ f v
The sculptor looked across bis atudlo to |
1 a beautiful marble and continued; "I had
this idea in view when I carved my
"Wounded Soldier." You notice that he is
almost nude. This feature of the work
has caused more comment, I suppose,
than any other. I have received nearly
200 letters asking me why he Is not
clothed. This is the story: You see that
broken gun lying on the ground at the
soldier's feet? That gun was broken upon
the soldier's head. He was left for dead
by his comrades. During the period of
insensibility produced by the shock of his
wounds he was robbed of his clothing save
his shirt by a band of marauders. When
he came to his senses he seized his shirt,
drew It from his form and threw it across
his loins, where you see It in the statue,
and tore It Into bandages which you see
him placing as best he can upon his arm.
The strained condition of the muscles and
the pose bring out possibly better than
anything else could the remarkable vigor
and ruggedness of the fig-ure."
Brancony's Maine Monument.
In a certain line of modeling, probably
the best-known sculptor now in America
is Leopold Brancony, a prize medalist ol
the Paris salon and the famous author of
the bust of Pope Leo XIII. Shortly after
the destruction of the Maine, Sig. Bran
cony made a design for a monument to
mark this national disaster. The slgnor
also has decided views upon the question
of the inspiring influence of the late war
upon art.
"I believe," he said, "that the war Is
destined to mark a new epoch in art In
thie country. I have already produced a
design for a Maine monument and have
another in view of a Red Crosa nurse.
The feminine figure in this war appeals
more strongly to me, perhaps, than that
of the soldier. In no other conflict have
there been so many volunteers among
women of family and wealth. The type
of woman is unusual from a physical,
mental and spiritual standpoint. I have
tried to bring the type out in the leading
figure of the Maine monument, 'the angel,"
but It can be even more forcibly expressed
in that of the Red Cross nurse. There are
great possibilities in the symbolic lessons
of the feminine side of this struggle, and
artists now In America more than the .art
lets of any other nation understand the
peculiar differences between the Ameri
can woman and the women of other lands.
The war is sure, also, to bring out many
military statues and innumerable fine
busts and war medals."
"I certainly believe," said Mr. Carr to
me the other day, '.'that the war offers
exceptional opportunities for great art
work. I spent four months with the sol
diers In and near Santiago. My picture
i of the church at El Caney was the first
one that I placed on exhibition, but I
have material for many others. I am now
painting a large canvas Illustrating the
execution of the crew of the Virginius. 1
My El Caney picture has been criticized |
for its fidelity to truth. It has been said
that I was making a play to the galleries,
but this is unjust. I painted war as it
isâ as I saw itâ and if I had omitted some
of the grewsome details I would have
been untrue to my profession."
Views of the War in Art.
"If you want to find out the influence
this last war will have upon art, you
must come to the dealers, and not to the
i artists," said one of the largest art men
to me. "We know the views of the artists
and the public as well, while the artist
can express only his own views. For my
part. I believe that the last war will have
a marked influence upon art. I think that
we have painters who will find in this
struggle an inspiration for some of the
greatest pictures that have been produced
in the past twenty years in America. The
public is ripe for works of this kind. This
is evidenced by the enormous sales of pic
tures of the navy, of the Maine, of Ha
vana and of scenes in Cuba during the
progress of hostilities. This demand has
worn off to a large degree, but I find that
whenever we present to our customers a
war picture of merit, whether it repre
sents a scene from the civil' or any for
eign struggle, It attracts instant and
widespread attention.
"It is all a question of the men. During
the Civil war we had no very great
painters. Therefore there are no master
pieces representing that conflict. But
now we have them, and I believe it will
be a question of time only till some of our
American painters produce work repre
i senting this great achievement of the
American arms in a manner worthy of
preservation for all time."
Still another phase of the effect of the
war upon art was described by a dealer
who traffics largely in decorative art. He
said that the military idea was permeat
ing every branch of decorative art, so
much bo that other goods suffered great
ly Plaques representing war Bcenes at
Santiago, Slboney and El Caney were in
demand; picture frames with designs in
different styles of arms had met with con
siderable popularity, and those bits of
statuary which form a part of cabinet
furnishings were invariably selected to
suit' the idea of war. Some of the statu
ettes made after the close of the civil war
which had been useless and unsalable for
years were now selling rapidly, especially
designs of "The Wounded Soldier," "Let
ters From Home," and other familiar sub-
C fn engravings, particularly, he found a
complete change In taste, the demand be
ing mainly for war subjects. In this field
the navy "seemed to be the special favor
ite, every battle-ship and officer having
been called for.

Peace by noting a sword In its left hand
instead of the right, and also represents
Victory by waving a large flag surmount
ed by a laurel wreath. On either side
heralds proclaim the approach of the
chariot. On the front of Â-ie chariot is
the American eagle with outstretched
wings and the motto, "E Pluribus Unum."
The group is thirty-five feet to Its high
est point, weighs twenty-five tons and the
contract price was $50,000.
Upon the pediments upon either side of
the arch will be placed two bronze groups,
also by MacMonnies, representing the
T'nited States army and navy. The
army group has just been finished, and
a photograph of it was received from
Paris a short time ago by a relative of
the sculptor. This is reproduced else
where, and, it will be seen, is a beautiful
piece of sculpture in relief. An interest
ing fact about it is that the figure of the
officer is a representation of MacMonnies
himself, slightly' idealized. Every one
who knows the sculptor pronounces it a
striking likeness.
This group symbolizes the Genius of
Patriotism urging American soldiers on
to victory. The navy group, which is not
yet completed, win represent American
sailors boarding a vessel at sea, urged on
by another Genius of Patriotism. In or
der to secure a perfect representation of
the proper naval weapons, Mr. Frank
MacMonnies, a brother of the sculptor,
obtained the loan from the Navy Depart
ment of pikes, cutlasses and pistols, which
he forwarded to his brother in Paris.
These two groups, when placed in posi
tion, will complete the memorial arch and
its decorations. The two groups will cost
$50,000 additional, and the completed arch
and its adornments will represent a total
cost of $206,000. It will, however, be an
art work of which Brooklyn may well be
proud, as it cannot be equaled in this
country.
The other fine equestrian groups in
bronze by MacMonnies are to face the
bicycld path at the Coney Island gate to
Prospect Park. One of them has recently
been placed on its pedestal, and the other
will be put in position before very long.
Each one represents a mounted youth en
deavoring to restrain two rearing and
plunging horses. The action of the groups
is bold, spirited and realistic, and the
workmanship is of the most finished char
acter.
Frederick MacMonnies, the author of
these notable works, was born in Brook
lyn In 1563. and evinced a natural talent
for sculpture from his earliest childhood.
At five years of age he stood by a kitchen
table while his mother made bread, and
modeled figures of men, women and ani
mals from the dough. These were so
natural that they soon attracted atten
tion. He seems to have come by his ge
nius by inheritance, for, although his
father was a plain Scotch business man,

his mother was a descendant of Benja
min West, the famous painter.
Wax was then given to the child and
he modeled many figures In It. At the
age of seven he made an equestrian fig
ure of Washington, which is still pre
served in his family and is quite a credi
table piece of work. When he was a few
years older he would obtain a lump of
clay from a brickyard near his home and
model all kinds of figures from it. When
he was 10 years old he was taken to Bar
num's circus, and as soon as he returned
home he modeled an elephant in clay.
As soon as he left school his father put
him to business, as he did his other sons,
but Frederick was unable to retain a po
sition for any length of time. Instead
of running errands he had a habit of lin
gering before art stores to gaze longingly
upon the paintings and sculpture In the
windows.
Finding that he could think of nothing
else but sculpture, hla father obtained ;i
situation for him as a clay sifter in the
studio of St Gaudens. New York. It
was understood that all the time he could
spare from this duty he could devote to
modeling. Here his father came to iiis
ussiPtancc by Inventing a machine by
which he could sift as much clay in one
hour as formerly required a whole cin>.
By this means he had plenty of time for
modeling, and at night he attended the
classes at the Academy of Design and
the Art Students' League. At 18 he made
a bust of his father, which was an ex
cellent likeness. .
Wtaei) he was 20 f he took the first prize
at the Academy of Design. His father
then agreed to send him to Paris, and he
was admitted to the Ecole dcs Beaux
Arts. In his first year there, when he
was only 21, he was awarded the first
prize by acclamation. The following year
he received the same honor. His first
important work was a statue of Young
Pan, which has been much admired. This
was followed by a statue of Diana. His
largest commission after this was his fa
mous fountain at the World's Fair. In
Chicago. This commission was refused
by a number of prominent sculptors, as
the contract required that the fountain
should be finished in eighteen months,
and they claimed that the time was too
short.
JVtaeMonnies submitted his design, it
was accepted and he took the commission.
He worked night and day and nearly
killed himsplf, but on the stipulated day
his fountain was playing at the head of
the Court of Honor on the World's Fair
grounds. He received J50.000 for this, and
ft 1b understood spent that much in mak
ing it.
His statue of Mr. Stranahan. in Pros
pect Park, and his famous figure of Na
than Hale, in City Hall Park, were his
next works. Then followed the Quad
riga, which he himself and all who have
beheld It consider his masterpiece, and
one that will last for ages.
Several authors at the end of the six
teenth and beginning of the seventeenth
century mention a man who had lost
both his eyes, but could see through his
nose. An account of him is given in
the "Oculus Artiflcialis Teledioptricus"
of Joannis Zahn. It appears that he

TO he the best known individual of a
race of ten million peopia is no j
small responsibility, and yet that is
My the position which Booker j
T. Washington holds to-day, with â¢â 
â  regard to the negroes in this coun- |
try.' A^ Froderi< k Douglass grew to be an j
okl man the question was often at I
â who was to take his place as the leader of
the colored people in the United States.
Until* the time of the Atlanta Exposition
In 1894 there had appeared no probable j
successor. The address of Booker T. j
'â¢Washington at the exposition challenged \
the attention of the entire country. He
was at the time the comparatively un- i
known principal of a recently established I
. struggling school for colored young men j
and women in the middle of the "Black ,
Belt" of Alabama. In the short tlmo j
which has elapsed since the delivery of I
the Atlanta address Mr. Washington's
â achievements and the very general recog
nition of his talents and ability have
brought him so prominently before the
public that it seems quite proper to speak
of him as the best known colored man in
the United States to-day. A few among ;
the many causes which have led to this I
result are the conferring of a degree upon
him by Harvard University; his notable,
.-Mldress at Boston on the occasion of the
unveiling of the Shaw monument on Bos
ton Common, with many other able ad
dresses all over the country: his selection
by the trustees of the John F. Slater fund
to conduct for them, with the assistance
' Mrs. Washington , a series of meetings
for the colored people in all the cities of
th* South, thin work to cover a period of j
two years; his successful administration
f f tho affairs of Tuskegee Institute, a
gr<Â»at school of a thousand pupils; his se-
Alectlon to be one of the orators at the j
prace jubilee in Chicago in October of 1395. j
where he spoke to an audience of 15.000 peo
ple, in the presence of President McKin

"Washington a most distinguished compll
ment: and last, the visit which the Presi- |

Does Not Know His Age.
In view of what he has accomplished j
the early life of Mr. Washington and the ;
opportunities for education which he had j
are interesting. It is a striking comment
ary on some of the conditions of life
which have been posible in this country
that to the very natural first question,
"How Old is Booker Washington?" the
answer must be returned, "He does not
know." He was born a slave in the State
of Virginia In either the year 1857 or 1858.
So humble was his origin, so scant the
notice taken of the fact that one more
black boy had been born on "the place,"
that no special attention was given to his
birth which would accurately fill the date.
His home for those first years, near the
village of Hales Ford, was one of those
one-room log cabins, with uncouth chim
ney of wood and clay glued upon the end,
such as any one may even yet see in all
parts of the South. The floor of the cab
in was the hard-trodden earth, and the
veils had no windows, a circumstance
wl.lch was not 30 very great account
since the door was rarely closed, and
wh >n it was both light and air found free
passage between the logs of the walls
where the mud chinking had fallen out.
Freed From Slavery.
Mr. Washington must have been about
S yenrs old when the war closed. I have
heard him tell of that event in these
words: "We knew there had been a war,
and in our cabins talked about it. One
rrornlng word was sent over the whole
place for all the hand 3to come up to the
'big house.' Standing there in the yard
in front of the porch a paper was read
out loud to us, and my mother, bending
over me, whispered to me that we were |
free. I was too ycung to really under
stand what that meant then."
There was now the family to be provid
ed for, and soon after freedom was de-

I visiting her there. It was she who taught
I the boy Booker to read. Speaking of him

"He was always a good boy, quiet and
determined to amount to something. He
never wasted his time, as so many of my

would sit down in a corner of the kitchen,

try different things; once I remember
working on a steamboat, but he alwa>-3
came back to me, until he finally started
for Hampton."

was to realize at once that this was a
means for "getting on." It was not a
question of whether he should go, .or

Hampton. He had no money to spare, for
all he had earned had gone to help sup
port the family.
How He Went to Hampton.
Of this turning point In his life let his
own words tell: "When I found out that
Hampton was a place where a black boy
could study, and at the same time have a
chance to work for his board, and that In
addition to study he would be taught how
to work, I made up my mind to go there.
Telling my mother good-by, I started
out one morning to find my way
to Hampton, although I had but a very
few cents In money, and did not have even
any definite Idea where Hampton was.
But I inquired my way. and by walking,
begging rides, and paying for a portion of
the journey on the steam cars with money
earned on the road, I finally reached the
city of Richmond, Va. I was without
friends there and entirely without money.
I found a good dry place under a plank
1 sidewalk and crawled in there to sleep the
(first night. The next day I found work
on a vessel where I could earn some
money. As the job would last for sev
eral days I kept at work, sleeping every
! night in the same place under the slde
walk. It was a comfortable place, arid
I was In that way enabled to save the
most of my wages to help me to go on.
When I reached Hampton I had 50 cents
left.
"At Hampton I found an opportunity xor
class-room education and for practical
training In industrial life, opportunity to
learn thrift, economy and push. Amid
Christian Influences I was surrounded by
an atmosphere of business and a spirit of
self-help that seemed to awaken every
faculty in me and cause me for the first
time to realize what it meant to be a man
Instead of a piece of property."
Beginning His Life Work.
"While I was at Hampton I resolved
that when I had finished my course of
training there I would go into the far
South, into the 'Black" Belt' of Uie
South, and give my life to providing the
same kind of opportunity for self-reliance
and self-awakening that I had found pro
vided for me at Hampton. My work be
gan at Tuskegee. Ala., In 1881, In a email
shanty and church, with one teacher and
thirty students, without a dollar's worth
of property. The spirit of work and of
industrial thrift, with aid from the State
and generosity from the North, has en
abled us to develop the school to its pres
ent proportions."
Tuskegee Institute is now a school
where over a thousand young colored men
and Women are taught each year how to
make their lives count for the most possi
ble, both for themselves and for their
race. It is an intensely practical school,
and does not teach books so much as it
does facts, and how to use them. The
school now owns several thousand acres
of land and about forty buildings. The
pupils who are studying farming do all
the work upon the land, and of the forty
buildings, many of them three and four
Btory brick structures, all except the first
three small ones have been built, begin
ning with the making of the bricks and
the cutting of the lumber, by the pupils in
the mechanical arts classes! Tuskegee is
the largest school in the world for colored
pupils conducted wholly by colored teach
ers. Its executive force and Instructors,
numbering nearly one hundred, are all
men and women of the negro race, and
except for the board of trustees, none of
whom reside at the school, there is no one
connected with the institute who is not of
the race for the helping of which its ef
forts are directed. One unique feature of
Tuskegee is its Negro Conference held
there in February of each year. There
are many other schools for colored young
men and women in the country, but no
where else is there a school for the fath
ers and mothers of these young people.
That is what the conference really is. a
school, even though its sessions are for
only one day in a year, and the most of
the pupils who come to it have gray hair
and cannot reed or write. As I heard a
grizzled old negro say, when he made the
prayer which opened one of these ses
sions: "O Lawd. we wants to tank de for
dis our one day ob schoolln' in de whole
year."
Tuskegree now has a fine new brick
church, large enough to seat over two
thousand people, dedicated in the spring
of IS9B. This building was designed by
onÂ© of the instructors there, and. like all
the others, built by the boys. The growth
of the school and of the conference has
been so rapid during the last five years
that until this building was erected there
was no audience room large enough to
accommodate the students at chapel or
the men and women at the conference,
and a rudely built temporary structure
had been used. I doubt if the new church
will accommodate the conference now.
and If it does I am sure the meeting will
be as impressive as it was in Its old sur
, roundlngs.

THE ADMIRAL`S
MISADVENTURE
J^pjADVENTURE
by Gilbert Heron,i^teKPlA
THE dinner gong was Just sounding Its noisy warning to the hungry
occupants of H. M. S. Gigantic's wardroom one evening in Feb
ruary 18OT as I crossed from my cabin to the admiral's for dinner.
We were in the Grecian Archipelago with the eastern division
of the Mediterranean fleet; and the Gigantic, one of the latest
class of battle-ships, was the flagship, carrying Vice Admiral Stan
hope C B whose flag lieutenant I had the honor of being during
the whole of hie long and eventful command in those waters. We had that
afternoon left the island of Lesbos, after a week's stay, and we had evi
dently intended staying there far longer, when suddenly a telegramâ from
what' quarter I did not yet knowâ had been sent us packing at an hour's
notice.
Affairs at Constantinople had been serious for some timeâ most seri
ous, indeed; and in common with every one fore and aft the chip, I sur
mised that our proceedings must be in some way connected with the course
of events there. My curiosity was, in fact, thoroughly roused, the more
bo that the admiral, with unusual reticence, had studiously avoided any
reference to our ultimate destination throughout the day. Admirals, how
ever are curiously like ordinary mortals in most ways, and I hoped that
after dinner, when the generous wine had begun to do its work, he would
prove more communicative. It was, therefore, with more than usual in
terest that I obeyed the summons of the loudly clanging gong, and entered
the admiral's cabin. Punctual as ever to the second, he was gleaming in
the fore cabin, where the small table at which we dined was gleaming in
the eoft yellow glow of the incandescent lights, with the sheen of brilliant
â white r.apery, cut-glass and silver."
The admiral, usually so genial, was reserved and taciturn, answering
my attempts at conversation in monosyllables, and he had a preoccupied
and somewhat careworn look. Soup, fish and entree we consumed almost
In silence, broken only by the sounds of the ship's band each time the
cabin door opened, and the unending throbbing of the great engines away
down in the heart of the ship. Not till the meal was over and our cigars
alight did the admiral unbend.
"Harley," he said, the strains of the ever-impressive "Miserere," from
Verdi's "Trovatore-," softly floating in upon us, "I daresay you've been
wondering why we left so suddenly this afternoon and where we are off
to. I did not enlighten you before because I had not quite made up my
mind as to what part you were to take in the affair on hand; but as I
have come to- the conclusion that you are the best individual to help me, I
will put you in possession of the facts. Yo.u know, of course," he con
tinued, "that things in Constantinople have lately been causing grave
anxiety to the Governments of Europe. The patience of our own Govern
ment has been often enough severely tried, and to-day, according to the
cipher cablegram which I received, the Sultan has overstepped the
boundary and the Embassador has sent for the fleet. 1 am to concentrate
all my available strength at the Island of Imbros, in a bay on the north
side of the island, which is well screened from passing observation. It is,
of course, of the utmost importance that our movements should be kept
entirely secret, both from the Turkish Government and from the Gov
ernments who would side against England In the event of war, and at
Imbros we shall be out of the way, and yet only about thirty miles from
the mouth of the Dardanelles."
"And what is to be done then, sir, on our arrival at Imbros?'
"The fleet will remain there, while the Embassador will send his steam
j-acht, the Imogene, down to fetch me. He desires to see me prsonally
and give me certain instructions regarding the possible, nay. inevitable,
outbreak of hostilities. I had at first decided to go up alone, but on second
thoughts I have resolved that you shall accompany me."
"Hut are you quite certain then, sir. that war must result?"
"Almost. You see. although the British Government does not wish to
Incur the onus of actually declaring war, it is making certain diplomatic
moves which, as far as one can tell, must result in war. The Embassador
is to demand the enforcement of certain drastic reforms and demand also
such great concessions that if granted would give England practically the
entire control of things eastern. This, too, he is to demand being carried
into effect within twelve hours of his ultimatum. Now, even in the very
unlikely event of the Porte assenting to his propositions, or even promis
ing to "consider them, the other nations of Europe will never agree to
them, and this will at once precipitate the Armageddon which England is
at length prepared for. We shall arrive at Imbros about four bells in the
morning watch, and anchor in "Divisionsâ Line ahead.' The Imogene
should be awaiting our arrival on the north side of the isle. I will give
you a kmg general signal now, if you will come into the cabin, which will
inform the captains of the object of our journey and prepare them for
further developments." And rising he Jed the way into the brilliantly
lighted cabin.
At 6 a. m. The next day the fleet, still steaming in two lines, swept
round the northeast corner of the hilly and rugged little island of Imbros
and dropped anchor there.
As the admiral had expected, the Imogene was already on the spot.
I followed the admiral down the accommodation ladder into his ir.-oared
barge, a long, lithe boat painted a deep blue, which hadâ and still has, T
Relieveâ the reputation of being one 6f the best racing boats on the sta
tion. Wo were rapidly pulled through the odd half mile of clear and spark
ling blue water which separated us from the Imogene, whose commander
was standing on her quarter deck waiting to welcome us.
"You are quite ready to proceed, I suppose?" said the admiral as soon
ap we were aboard.
"Quite, sir," responded the commander, and in a few moments we were
speeding on our way. Two hours later we rounded Cape Hellas and en
tered the historic Dardanelles, and for the next few hours sped*swiftly
along that famous and strongly guarded channel.
About 6 p. m. we entered the sea of Marmora, and at the rate we were
traveling expected to sight Constantinople between 10 p. m. and 11 p. m.,
and exactly at five bells in the first watch I caught my first glimpse of
the wonderful city. We dropped anchor opposite Tophane, in the midst
of a double line of passenger steamers from every country in Europe.
A small steam launch, which had been waiting our arrival at the land
ing stage, now came busily panting up alongside. At the quay a closed
carriage was waiting for us, and then, threading our way past the moonlit
quays, warehouses and arsenals of Tophane, we were soon clattering
along the fine Rue Yeni-Chartche, at the head of which stood our destina
tion, the British Embassy.
The Embassador received us in person, having timed our arrival to a
nicety, and it was 7 a. m. before tro interview terminated, and we were
rapidly being driven back to the landing stage. In an hour's time we
were once more aboard the Imogene. the anchor hoisted and the fantastic
white glory of Stamboul being rapidly left behind us.
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, having lunched, we had come on deck,
find the admiral was easily discussing the probable course of events which
would result on the Embassador promulgating his ultimatum, which he
was to have done at noon.
"They're in an awful stew by this time at Yildiz Kiosk, I expect," he
paid, with a. certain mischievous relish, rubbing his hands the while. He
was in the best of humors, and could find fault with nothing.
Suddenly he stopped dead and quickly glanced at his watch, end from
his watch to me in a questioning way.
Before I had time to Inquire the meaning of this performance he ejac
ulated: "By Jove! Here it is half-past 2 and we don't seem far down the
sea of Marmora: I think I'll have to look at the chart!"
So saying he walked swiftly to the charthouse.
The commander happened to meet us on the fore and aft bridge and
civilly saluted.
"Captain Thornton," said the admiral, "will you be good enough to
show me our present position on the chart?"
The commdiider, slightly surprised at this request, led the way into
the charthouse. where a chart lay spread open on the desk, and pointed
out our position with a pair of compasses.
The admiral suddenly became very grave.
"Lend me your compasses, " he said.
Taking them, he rapidly measured the exact distance between the
point the 'commander had Indicated and the island of Imbros. It was 150
milos. and T suddenly understood the admiral's discomposure.
"Thornton." he said, nervously, cutting his words off short and sharp
like so many pistol shots, as was his'wont, "what's the utmost speed you
can knock out of the Imogene?"
"H'mâ well, fourteen knots, sir, at a pinch."
"The utmostâ la that the very utmost she can doâ even under forced
draft?"
"We might just possibly Ret a trifle more. sir. but I doubt itâ in fact,
sir, fourteen knots la more than I've ever got out of her."
"Good Lord!" cried the admiral. "Harley, we shall ruin everything!
We can't get down to the -fleet in time! Who would ever have imagined
that one couldn't get more than fourteen knots out of a blessed shtp like
this? What the deuce is to be done?" â  â¢
"But. sir," said thÂ» commander, not quite liking the admiral to speak
thus disparagingly of hfi vessel.. "I don't quite understandâ "
"Look here, sir." interrupted the old admiral, thoroughly exasperated.
"Listen to me. and by Jove, you jolly well will soon 'understand. We are
150 miles, from the fleet, which is a good twelve or thirteen hours' run. as
matters stand. I must be with the fleet by daybreak te-morrow, for If war
Js not declared even now it will be by then, and now I find that this wretch
of a dispatch boat can't do )t. and that I've been ass enough to forget
such i vital consideration as the speed of the ship which is to take me
back to my squsdron. But pet there T will, somehow or other. Look here,
Harley. can't you think of anything? Don't stand there In that irri
tating- tfayâ for goodness' sake say something!"
"â Well, sir." I replied. "T haven t got plans all cut and dried at a mo
ment's notice, but I'll set my wit? to work. Never fear, we'll find some
way of getting out of this pnrticularly awkward holp."
"H'm." said he. "Spa here, something's got to be done. Harley. In the
meanwhile. r'antain Thornton, keep her up to the very utmost you can
ppt out of her." We'll go and smoke a cipar. Harley, and see if we can't
think out some way of prettlnpr through all right."
And top-ether we descended to the quarter deck again.
We walked up and down for some time dismissing all sorts of more or
less feasible plan?. ThÂ°re was another obstacle, too, that we had over
looked, a most serious one
"Let me se<Â»." said thÂ» admiral. "Sunset Is at 6 p. m., worse luck.
And. by Jove, now that I come to think of it, we shan't he able to get

through after sunset. What a confounded nuisance. They won i airow
any vessel to go through, you know, between sunset and sunrise, wnai
on earth is to be done? We can't run the gauntlet of the forts in tns
Jimcrack concern, that's certain. They fire at you, you know, it >ou at
ternm to run through." M . â _. _ .â.,
As he spoke we turned and I caught sight of our signalman, who haa
come aft to clip the ensign to some passing vessel. Looking to see what
vessel we were saluting. I saw it was a small steamer flying the red flag
of Turkey. At that instant a brilliant idea seized me.
"Do you see that flag, sir?" said I to the admiral.
"Yes." he said, dryly* "I certainly see it. It's the Turkish flag. But
what that has to do with the matter we're discussing I must confess I
don .'. t^? c u 1 1 1 te sl s r e^'i responded, "that flag has Just informed mo of a way to

through?"
"Well, sir, it suddenly struck me that, although no other vessels are
allowed through the Dardanelles after sunset, Turkish men-of-war are.
"Harley you don't for an instant think I'm going to sail under that
vile rag do you? No, sir; I've never sailed under false colors as yet and
I'm not going to begin now, that's very certain," he added, with a toucn

joying his bewilderment now that I hal found a way out of our difficulty,
"vessels don't fly their colors after sunset."
â¢'Well, then, how on earth do you proposeâ Â«'.-Â«â¢Â» . â¢/â¢V-V â¢
"This is mv idea, sir. It's a rather risky thing to doâ in fact, perhaps
you won't relish doing it at all"â I knew the grim old seadog. would,
thoughâ "but I think we can get through with it all the same. .
. "Out with it, man; don't hang in the wind any longer. If it 11. get me

"Do you remember, sir; that when we passed Chanak-Kalesi yesterday
there were some Turkish torpedo boats lying at anchor under convoy or
a sloop?" â¢ â  . 'â *.-', â 
, "Yes." said the admiral, as mystified as ever. '. * , t v,
"Well I propose to get you aboard one of those boats by stealth, sur- ,
prise the officersâ they only -carry one cr two at the utmostâ and compel
them at the point of the swordâ or. to be literal, at the muzzle of our
AVebley revolversâ to take us down to Imbros. The boats can do an easy
twenty knots an hour, and we shall get there beautifully in time. .<
"Harlev. you're a perfect genius," cried the now delighted^ admiral.
"That's grand." he said. "That's one of the best things I've heard for
many a day. It's glorious. But I must say, it'll want some doing.- It s a
rather big "order, and a Jolly risky thing to boot. ' If we were not on the _
eve of war with Turkey I don't kno.w that I'd be justified in doing it. But ,
as war is only a matter of hoursâ how do you propose to get aboard? ..
"We'll get down the Dardanelles as far as we can in this packet, sir.
and then drop anchor to avoid any unnecessary civilities from the. forts,
and wait till it's pitch dark. Then lower a cutter and take, say, six picked
men -with us quickly drop down with the current to the nearest torpedo '
boat, board her secretly, surprise the; officers before they can say Jack
Robinson,' and the thins is done." â  -C- r â¢ -'-.-.â  ,:. 7 - '...,.â  . ' â¢ ..; *"
"That will do splendidly," he cried-- _" V. -â .
"All we have to do is to be very careful not to fire a shot, and to com
pel the boat's own officers to navigate her, and make her number to the
forts as we pass, anff. voila tout." . â  . â¢* "â  ''â it' "'"i*'-" Â
He at once sought the commander and gave him particulars or our
plan. The first thing to do was to pick out a suitable boat's crew to take
with" us We did not want many men. but those we did take would have
to be as true as steel, and as the commander naturally, knew his ship
company better than we did, we allowed him to choose. our, men.
â  Eventually ten were selected, six to go with us. the other four to take
the cutter back to the Imogene. for we desired to leave no trace of our
exploit in the shape of a drifting man-of-war's boat, which might tell awk
wfl rd tslos ' â  * -â  â  â¢ . .â Â» â â¢â _ -â  â¢â¢t _^ â  . â  .â  . â ?*- ,â¢*'"' â â 
And a fine, brawny .set of fellows they looked as they stood in the ,
deck saloon facing the old admiral, caps. in hand, in truly characteristic .
sailor fashion. Briefly he explained to them what they were about to do.
"Now my lads " he concluded, "it's a dangerous game we re going to
play but it's for the sake of the old flag, and I'm sure every one of you
will do his utmost. I'll look to it that you don't lose by your adventure,
and that you pet proper recompense. Is there any one who does not quit*
care to iro with us?" . ' , â¢ . "-â *â 'â¢ ' â 'â¢' ' ' , '
A gurgle of respectfully suppressed merriment ran through the group 1
at his last remark. As If these British tars would not board even a dozen
Turkish vessels at their beloved old admiral's behest!
And then, in response to several nudges and whispers, a racy looking
petty officer whose round, clean-shaven face was crossed by innumerable
tiny' wrinkles of good humor, took a couple of paces forward, and sheep- â¢
ishl.- finsrering his can said: â¢ . / ' Â .' :
"Rper.kin' on behalf of meself and me shipmates ere. sir, I begs to say
it won't be our fault If you don't get through, sir. We'll see that you get
to the fleet in time, sir, if there ain't a soul of us left alive to see you do
"That's the style, lads!" cried the admiral, rubbing his hands glee
fully. "And now go and take a glass of grog each from the steward, and
get ready for the fun to-night." . .;â¢/'â¢'â ,;

At 6 p m we had again passed Gallipoll. and the sun was .lust begin
ning to Fink in the west. We dined at 6:30. and intended dropping anchor
about eight or ten miles north of Chanak-Kalesi. No sooner, had we dined
than we were on deck, making our final preparations, and anxiously await
ing the time of action. When the sun had finally disappeared we stopped
engines. But before the rattle of our cable through the hawseholes had
time to break upon the hot. still air, there came a fat puff of white smoke .
from a battery on the Asiatic side, and a shot plunged down into the water
unpleasantly close to 01 bows. â¢
"All right, you beggars!" said the commander, you wont want to
waste any more arnmunitim on this packet to-night."
Even as he spoke our port anchor -dropped with a great splash, the
engines went full speed astern, and we came to. a dead "stop right under
the shadow r-f the f'->u. ... .-'â "â 
At S:3(Mt was pitch dark; the very night for such an enterprise, moon
and stars alike shrouded behind a thick gray mask of cloud, while there
was practically no wind, and hardly a ripple on the water. We came on
deck and mustered our little party, while the cutter was bein;? silently
lowered. Eaoh carried a service revolver, loaded in all its chambers, and
while the admiral and myself carried the usual service sword, our men
had all of them bare cutlasses. â  o?v - .
Thus equipped we took our places in the boat, and with "Good luck
and God speed to you!" from the commander, shoved off into the black
and silent nl^ht. ;? I, ' i -' ? " ; Â â â ' â  -'
I took the tiller, and for some time we preserved a dead silence, all our
thoughts, all our energies, concentrated on one objet, determined to carry
out our project or yield our lives in the attempt. â¢
Then the admiral, unable to bear the tension any longer, whispered
to me: â . -â â â =*â â %<â¢' ..-.-â¢;.â â ;, >'â > â :â .-â .â¢:-.

"Aye. aye. sir." T answered, in a voice hoarse and thick with sup
pressed excitement: "I'm making dead for her stern." .. â¢ - .
"Hope they don't keen a very sharp lookout." was his next remark.
"Don't suppose the beggars do. Fir," I answered. "They're awfully
lax in those matters, you know. sir, the Turks." . . .
We were moving swlftlv by this time, and had left the twinkling lights
of the Imogene a good distance in our rear. . â¢ â -, â 
Straight ahead lay a, torpedo boat, shrouded in a veil of impenetrable
blackness, where a solitary anchor light for'ard betrayed her pres
ence. Before leaving the Tmogene I had told each man exactly what to do.
"Use cold steel. lads." I had snid, "and remember that all our lives depend
upon silence andnuick action." - .
Gradually we drew near the low round stern of the boat, till we were
almost in her shadow dead astern. â¢ .
"Way enough!" I whispered, and ten oars swung silently skyward as
one.' . ' .-â  ' â  * , '. â  . â  â  9 - ' 'â¢ . ' ~ â¢ â 
"Boat your oars! r * . ,"-â¢..
The two boatmen, each with a boathook, stood by to hang on while we
clambered up over the torpedo' boat's stern, and the next Instant we were
alongside. i;'-...'''.- ' â¢"â '..:,â ".â : -:'-.â¢- .;- .
The admiral sprang out with an agility wonderful in a man of his
years, climbing swiftly and silently up the low stern and on to the Kamp
tulicon covered deck. , ___
I followed, and in a few seconds all eight of us had silently gained our
positions. â¢
Not a soul showed on her upper deck, and it was almost pitcn ad,rÂ»,
except where the fc-tay light for'ard cast a sickly and uncertain nicker on
her bows, and a faint glow just showed us the position of the main decK
hatch amidships. , oflnW
Four of our men who were to go forward crouched low in trie snauuw
of the after hatch cover, while two others, loosing their cutlasses, preparea
to follow the admiral and myself down into the dog's hole of a cabin wnicn
did duty as the officers' quarters. 'â  . .
"Now!" whispered the admiral, and he dropped bodily down the hatcn
way â a mere manhole just large enough to admit one- person at a time
Into the space below. .
It was a tiny rectangular cabin, with cushioned lockers, and a ami ana
dirty oil lamp giving an uncertain light.
Stretched out on the cushions were two Turkish officers, one already
fast asleep; the other rubbing his eyes and yawning as one who antici
pates a hearty nap. â 
We were on them instantly, just as the two sailors who followed us
dropped down the hatchway. â  .
"If you speak a single word you're a dead man!" I fiercely whispered
In French' to the man who was still awake, giving my revolver an om
inous click, and holding the barrel to his temple.
The admiral had awakened the other, and gone through the same
performance, while our two sturdy blue-jackets, cutlass in hand, stood
blocking up the entrance.
"Whatâ what is the meaning of this farce?" asked the admiral s pris
oner, when he had somewhat recovered from his first surprise. ' My gen
tleman was not as yet capable of speech.
"It mean's, sir," said the admiral, watching the effect of his words
closely, "that you are prisonprs. and that we are' desperate men, who
are not afraid to stick at anything to attain our object." He spoke French
well and fluently, and there was not a trace of the nervous trepidation
he had displayed in the cutter.
"Prisoners?" said the Turk. "Prisonersâ who and what are you to
take us prisoners?"' . ..â¢ ?'â â ! -. ..
"Who and what are we does not concern you, answered the admiral.
"We require you to do us a service, a slight enough thing, and in return
for its performance you shall go scot-free, and it will not be our fault
if the affair is not kept perfectly secret. One thing I can assure you:
we are honorable men. and are not flying from justice, or about to com
â¢ mlt any crime. But political circumstances demand that we get through
the Dardanelles to-night, and you must do it for us."

Some of their arms are thoroughly
modern, but many of their "cannons" are
curious looking pieces, and I had rather

actors, and as for mixing with the native
Spanish, it is out of the question. The
drive is on the Paseo do Lunetta. a really
pretty avenue sweeping along the water
front just outside the fortifications.
Fashionâ for we do have fashion in
Manilaâ makes the proper hour for driv
ing from 5 to 7 o'clock in the evening, and
between these hours there is a constant
stream of carriages and pedestrians prom
enailng along the avenue.
The rainy season is about over, and
bright, sunny days, with occasional
showers in the afternoon, are the rule.
Warm hardly expresses the weather. We
feel that it is quite fresh and chilly when
the thermometer gets down to 75 degree.
Anywhere from S5 degrees tip is the usual
thing. I notice that the climate is es
pecially hard on women and children, and
the air is sure death to the soft and
blooming complexions I remember to have
eeen in San Francisco. Our own regiment
âthe Twenty-third Infantryâ is fast be
coming seasoned, for the most of us
served a rugge* apprenticeship in Ari
zona. We have neither yellow fever nor
cholera, but there Is undoubtedly danger
from smallpox unless the greatest precau
tions are taken.
Nothing I ever saw before ranks -with
the Filipino. He looks a mixture of Chi
nese, negro and monkey. The men aver
age a shade under five feet in height, and
their women are certainly the ugliest lot
of humanity on earth. In color they run
all the way from cheese to ebony, from
the palest bleached-out yellow to solid
chocolate. Once in a great while you see
one, rear view, that looks rather attrac
tive â pretty head, graceful shoulders; but
when the subject of your admiration
faces you the charm is rudely broken.
They have the tendency to adipose that
seems inseparable from female life in the
tropics, and at 21 they are about the same
height lying down as they are standing
erect.
The usual time of marriage is 15 years.
The young women have rather graceful
figures and are usually clothed in a sin
gle garment. Milliners are unknown to
the Filipino maiden, and her hair is coiled
tightly about her head and held by a pin
or some similar ornament. When a young
man wants to marry her he has to go into
a period of servitude to her father.
The Spanish ladies or half-castes â mes
tizos â are often good-looking, but as a
class they are a dead failure for beauty.
They have no favors to bestow on Los
Americanos; they stare ungraciously at
the bluecoats. and seem to regard us as
closely related to His Satanic Majesty.
We do not lack for literatureâ such as
.it is. There are already two American
dailies published hereâ the American an-1
the Times. There are three weekliesâ the
Manila Outpost, Uncle Sam and the Amer
ican Soldier. In addition, there are live
dailies published in Spanish. I send you
an extract from the Times which may be
of interest to Call readers who are anx
ious to visit this country for commercial

THERE are two precocious young

They are Carter de Haven and Bon

years of age and so different that
one cannot say which is better. Bonnie
is a little personlficator of grace in the
cake walk, a perfect reproduction from a
Louisiana plantation. Behind all her
sweetness and genius Bonnie has a sad
little tale, one told only too often in city
life. Mrs. de Haven said the other day:
"I found her playing in Chicago two
years ago. She had no one to manage
her, but still the child picked up a living
and had done so for three years. You
tell about It, Bonnie."
"I used to be in an orphan asylum. My
father went away and my mother could
not take care of me. My sister was an
actress, and she took me away when I
was 7 and taught me to dance and go on
the stage. Then she married and didn't
want me no more.

Worries and Triumphs of the Six Days' Bicycle Contest
How I Won the Race. $
By Champion Miller. 4
NO, this is not the hp.ppiest day in
my life. You see, I haven't won
as big- a prize a? I <lid at the New
York race in December. I won the
best prise there that any man ever
gamed â my wife.
But all tho same I'm fueling very happy.
For aside from my own disappointment" it
would have been an awful blow to Mrs.
Miller if I had lost. She just thinks I can
beat anybody and everybody.
There is one thing I want to say, and I
mean it: 1 never felt so well after a six
day race in my life. My hands and ankles
bother me very slightly, but aside from
that I feel ready to meet all comers.
Usually I'm pretty well done up for a
week or two after a race. The reason I
am in such good condition this time Is
that the track we rode on here is the
best that was ever laid down for this
sort of thing.
My trainer. Mr. West, didn't let me do
any hard work for a week before the
race. No one can ever convince me that
that is not the best way to train. The
reason that Gimm broke down was that
he worked like a slave up to the very last
mlnu,te. I kept telling hfm to stop: that
he was a fool. But he wouldn't listen.
The day before the race I never even
left the hotel. I stayed in bed all day

I rested. It's queer that though I never
get excited before a race, still I can't
Bleep just before it.
I had Just one hallucination during t'hls
race. I kept imagining that I was riding
up and down, up and down hillsâ and
sand hills, at that.
As soon as I took a minute's rest I knew
that it was a "daffy" idea, but back on
my wheel those same hills would pile up
before me and up and down them I would
go.
I rode my first six-day race at Chicago
in 1897 and came in second. My wife was
at that race but I didn't even know her
by sight then. She says she fell in love
with my riding, not me. A man in a six
day race is not much to look at.
Of course this has been a very profit
able business I for me. There is a good
deal more in it than Just the prize money
âsalary from the wheel you ride, etc. To
win a six-day race means about $5000 for

IT is true that ' I married Charlie
" Miller just before the finish of the
six-day bicycle race in New York
City last December. You have no
idea how many people ask me about
it and -teem to think that it was such
a wonderful thing for a girl to do.
Well, I don't think it was. Any giri
would do as much for the man she loved.
v/ould.n't shr? So when, on the fifth day
<tf the race. Charlie asked me whether
I would be willing to marry him on the
morrow before nil those people, I said
yes.
You see, the management knew that we
were engaged and they talked Charlie
into being marrkd at the close of the race
for the advertisement of their show and
it jammed the place with curious people.
All the managers in the world couldn't
have persuaded me, though. But when
Charlie asked me I just said yes, tele
graphed to my mother and went out to
bur my wedding gown.
When T went to New York to see Char-
He in the race I hadn't the slightest idea
that we would marry for months to come.
1 had planned to have a pretty little wed
ding at home in Chicago, with all my
dear friends around me.
I simply went to New York to see Char
lie win the race, for, of course, I knew
he would win. I stayed beside the race
track day and night, until I was almost
worn out with watching. Charlie always
wears a button with, our heads photo
graphed on it. Well, I used to watch
that button spin round and round the
track until I was dizzy.
I really enjoyed it, though, for I was
so sure he would win, and I met so many
lovely, kind people. Then I liked to hear
the crowd cheer him. It just made me
love all those people, not one of whom I
knew, to hear them sing his praises. All
the crack bicycle men were there and I
became fast friends with them and their
wives. â¢
It was on Friday afternoon that the
management first spoke to me of marry
ing Charlie right there before the crowd.
The race was to end Saturday evening,
but he was already so far ahead that
there was no doubt that he would win.
Of course I thought it was a crazy idea.
Imagine any girl of 18 being willing to
marry a man before all those strangers
and in such a strange piace as the track
of a six-day bicycle contest. I thought
they must have all gone crazy.
â¢But Charlie got off his wheel for a mo
ment and I went down to talk to him.
"Please. Genevieve," was all hÂ« said.
He looked so haggard and so anxious
that if he had asked me to climb the
mountains in the moon I would hay*
tried.
"I'll do It if you wish," was what I an
swered, and he remounted his wheel.
I telegraphed to my mother to come at
once on the lightning express. The man
agement announced that we Would be
married at 4 o'clock on Saturday after
noon. Then I went back to the hotel with
Mrs. Schfnneer, the wife of Fred Schin-

tired of it." The children had rigged up a

"When we travel we take two sections,
and one section is a playhouse for them.

Haven.
"And you like it?" imnM t
"Why, of course," put in Carter. 'Did
you see my clothes? They are all made
by the Prince of Wales 1 tailor, see.
He opened a bureau drawer and showed
me a neat pile of satin vests and ties ana
a black satin suit, all as orderly as any
old bachelor's.

Now how do you expect to keep anything
nice? Bonnie is so careless about her

laughing and brushed them.
neer. the crack cyclist.
We talked over the plans for getting
ready for such a quick wedding. It
seemed as if they had turned the six-day
bicycle contest Into a wedding-in-twelve
hour contest.
It was just a little after 4 when we
drove up. Mamma was with me, she
dashing in on the lightning express just
in time. Mrs. Schinneer was my brides
maid, and Arthur Gardiner, the champion
short-distance rider, was our best man.
The streets were crowded with people,
who were waiting to get a glimpse of us
when we got out of the carriage.
The manager met us at the door and
gave me the loveliest bridal bouquet that
any girl ever carried. Not even the
Duchess of Marlborough could have had
a prettier <sne.
AH the racers had stopped long enough
to get washed and shaved. Charlie joined
us at the door and then I wasn't a bit
nervous. I didn't see one of all those
thousands of people. I just knew that
Charlie was there and that we were going
to be married.
While I was dressing they had carpeted
the aisles and we walke.d into our box
to the most beautiful wedding march you
ever heard. All the people stood with
uncovered heads while the Alderman mar-
rled us.
It was just as solemn and sweet and
sacred to me as though we had been mar
ried in a church. And the "I will" meant
just as much to us and I am sure all
those people wished us happiness as sin
cerely as our dear friends at home.
When it was over every cycler there
wanted to kiss the bride. The six-day
racers had their turn first, because the
time they had agreed to lay off was al
most over and they were in a rush to
get back to their wheels on the track. I
don't suppose there was ever another '
bride on this earth before who was kissed
by all the champoin wheelmen in the '
world.
The minute the kissing was over Char- '
lie and the rest of them rushed back to ,
their wheels and began spinning around â 
the track again.
We stayed a few minutes and every J
beam and rafter in tho place shook with ,
the cheers and congratulations of the .
crowd. Then we drove off to a wedding â¢
dinner, for it was after 5 o'clock.
Just Imagine a wedding banquet with- ',
out the gToom! There T was, responding to .
their toasts, while Charlie was riding â¢
round and round the track, winning glory -
and the first prize.
But it had all been so novel and strange
that I was getting used to the unusual. \

WHEN I came to Stanford last
year all I had was twenty
five dollars." â¢
"Pshaw! that's nothing.
All I had was ten dollars."
"Oh keep quiet. You fellows were
millionaires. When I came last year I
was dead broke. Didn't have a bean in
the world."
And then a silence fell upon the little
group of university students who at
once forgot their discussion of worldly
affairs and turned their attention to the
classics.
"These money matters are not worth
discussing, anyhow," said the man who
had arrived dead broke, as he buried
himself in a well-thumbed volume of
Cicero.
The three students were residents of
â what is known as "the camp" of Stan
ford University, and in one respect
â were exact replicas of' the scores of
others who have their being inside the
little city of whitewashed shacks lo
cated just without the floral-bordered
grounds of the big institution of learn
ing. The camp is one of the most
unique features of Stanford University,
and within its precincts some of the
best students there have their homes.
Almost from the day the gates were
thrown open the cam"p has been a part
of the university life. At first there
were only a few tents, then a couple of
houses. Then the buildings increased
In number until the spot became like
a little city. It was thought that the
limit of the number of students in camp
was reached three years ago as the two
following years showed a marked fall-
Ing off. But this year the number is
nearly double what it ever was before,
a fact for which it would be difficult
to account.
"Are there any rooms to be had in
camp?" I asked a bright, athletic young
man who was hanging out a freshly
laundered sweater On the line to dry.
"Rooms?" he said in surprise, as he
took a couple of clothes pins out of
his mouth. "I should say not."
"But surely there are some accom
modations here?" I said, persistently.
"'Oh, yes, I guess we can find you a
bunk somewhere," my informant re
plied. "But don't come around here
esking for special accommodations, for
there are none. There hasn't been a
vacant room in camp this year and I
am not certain either whether there is
seven room for a bunk or not. Each of
the rooms has four beds and it's pretty
close quarters, in fact it's crowding
things, but perhaps we can. find room
for one more. Are you going to batch
it or feed at the joss house?"
The "joss house," it was explained,
1b the Chinese restaurant within the
precincts of the camp. This, however,
Is patronized more by outsiders, mil
lionaires, the .campites call them, who
think- nothing of paying 10 cents for a
meal. The camp bachelors get their
meals for about 3 cents each.
Not in all the world can the camp
of Stanford University be duplicated.
The poor student who has to "work
blB way through pollege" here finds
[ means to attain his end. A genial cli
mate and an admirable university man
agement makes it possible for a stu
dent to go through college without a
cent to start with. But of course most
of them have small savings with which
to commence the term. This makes it
very much easier, as the student does
not have to take so much time from his
studies in order to earn his living. The
average cost for bed and board in camp
is ?4 a month.
How do they do it?
Easy enough when you know how,
and you don't have to starve or be un
comfortable on the $4, either. One
lone bachelor in camp actually accom
plished the feat of living on $3 one
month, and he stands at the head in
his studies.
To accomplish such a feat in the
science of cheap living every man must
be willing to be his own housekeeper,
cook and washerman. By menus of the
customs and traditions handed down
by the pioneers of "the camp" and his
own observations he soon becomes mas
ter of a system of economy that would
put to shame the practices of. the most
saving New England housewife.
He learns the nutritive values of dif
ferent meats, and it does not take a
course in personal hygiene to teach him
that pork and the meats of fowls are
to be eschewed by poor men who wish
to get a supply of energy at the least
possible cost. Nothing goes to waste,
everything being converted into some
thing or other. Such adepts in the art
of saving are these students that if
they could be induced to turn their
hands to cooking they would be worth
their weight in gold to the proprietors
of a logging camp or lumber mill who.
are compelled to reduce the wages of
their men to even up the waste of the
kitchen.
Now these "campites" haven t any
different ideas on diet than the more
prosperous one in college. They all
have good digestive organs, and there
is not a single nut fiend content to
breakfast on peanuts, lunch on almonds
and dine on walnuts and butternuts or
a vegetarian among them. In short, tney
haven't any new theories on living to
establish. Their menus would be vastly
different if cold necessity was not sit
ting at their elbow when the day's bill
of fare is made out.
Visitors to Palo Alto al' see the
"camp." They are shown the place
where the poorer students live, because
it is a queer settlement to be found in
a big college. But the visitors do not
know how great the sacrifices are that
are made daily. If you told them that
the bright-faced and wide-awake fel
low who had just been entertaining
them was able to reduce his expenses to
$1 per week they would not believe you.
The camp men themselves would not be
likely to enlighten them, for they are
loth to dwell on the question of
finances.

WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH
COLLEGE.
money Is saved, and time is money to
these men, many of whom must not
only keep up in their studies, do their
own work and economize, but earn the
money required for their heeds.
Four is the best number for a club.
There must be a cook and a house
keeper and dishwasher. While they are
doing the work of the other two are
playing the independent student witli
time, in plenty, to spend on their
books. The next week things are re
versed and the men of leisure become
the house drudges.
Every fellow does his own washing.
He must do it on a certain day which
is "hip." for there is only one tub and
washboard .in the "camp." It is the
community property of the "camp"
and was in all probability purchased
when the camp organization was first
effected. The day may soon come when
there will be a camp laundryman as
there is a camp baker.
This last named worthy turns nut
bread as white and light and delicious
as ever came from the must improved
oven. He makes his batch, divides it
into loaves and sells it to his confreres
at enough above cost to pay him for
his extra time and .labor. There is
some talk at present that there may
soon be an opposition bakery.
It was noontime when the "ramp"
was visited. Some of the students
were preparing meals; others were
eating their midday repast. Beans,
potatoes, bread and prunes were
staple articles of diet. In some huts,
however, a greater variety was af
forded.
In speaking to one of the members of
the Owl Club, which organization
probably gets its name from the habits
of its members, who are supposed to
sit up all hours of the night over their
books, burning vast quantities of
midnight oil, a good idea of how the
men themselves regard their life was
obtained.
After Riving; accounts of different
phases of camp life, the young man who
has spent two years in his present
quarters continued: "You see, it is like
this. The fellows do not pretend' to live.
We merely exist while we are here. At
most it is only four years. Few fellows,
however, are compelled to live in the
carrfp throughout their college course.
A raise usually comes along in some
form or another. One gets a lift from
home; another secures a good paying
job doing something about college; a
third may be given some student body
position as business manager or editor
in-chief of one of the college publica
tions. ,
"When this happens then prepara
tions are made .for a move, and when
the next semester opens the fortunate
individual is found esconsed in a com
fortable room in Encina Hall with
money enough in his pocket to eat at
the inn. Scores of fellows have struck
it lucky and after a few semesters of
hard work and privation have been
able to better their mode of living. It
doesn't seem to make much difference
at Stanford if a fellow has worth
whether he has money or not. If he has
the ability the student body will give
him a position to fill, thus enabling
him to get along.
"Graduation comes as a relief to
many of us. We do not dread the 'cold
world' as do many of the students who
have had fat allowances during their
college days. The greater number of
us have worked all our lives. We know
men in general better than tUey do, and
our hard experience In the past makes
us better fitted to meet the disappoint
ments and failures that most graduates
must go through on leaving college to
begin life for themselves.
"Life in the camp," continued the
student, "is not all a hard grind. Much
comes up to vary the. monotony. Many
of the fellows who live here are prom
inent in college activities, particularly
in debating. Not a few of them find
time to do work in athletics as track
men or football players, all of which
goes to show that if their food is plain
it is substantial."
In glancing around the" room a long
row of empty cans attracted my atten
tion. They were fastened to one of the
beams by nails driven through the
opened lids. Some had pictures of
oysters on their face; others had evi
known- to them, surely your Government will see that you acted under
coercion." A singular little smile flitted across the somewhat saturnine
countenance o^^eTm-k.^,,^ Bald, "that at least you feel that I have

gun-cotton, with which explosive the torpedo-heads -were charged. They
had, in fact, literally blown the bottom of the torpedo-boat to pieces, but
done little damage else.*
Before we had been in the boat many minutes oneâ two â three ominous
looking tins made their appearance close at hand, and had we not gained
our point of vantage just in time it would have pone hard with us, with
out doubt. The admiral, although devoutly grateful for our providential
escape, was in no very enviable state of mind.
After all our plotting and planning, he felt it very hard to be thus
frustrated at the eleventh hour; for we could certainly not get to our
destination at the proper time in a tiny canvas rowing-boat.
"We must be a good fifteen miles away," he cried. "I can't get to the
fleet in time! We don't even know the course to steer! If only we had a
compass!" ,
One of our mm, overhearing him, said something in a whisper to
his companion, and I just managed to catch the word "compass."
â¢'What is it. my man?* I asked. "
"Bill 'ore, sir, sez 'c's got a compass on a watch-chain, sir, If that'd
be of any use." ( .
I jumped at the opportune chance.
"Rather! Hand it over, my man, and let me have a look at it!"
He dive<l into his jumper pocket, and from a miscellaneous collection
of matches, spun yarn, clap pipes, quids of ancient tobacco, and half
a-dozen other articles selected a dingy watch-chain, with a tiny pocket
compass attached.
"Thank goodness!" said the .admiral, for toy though it was, it would
give us our bearings. "Now, men. out oars and pull!"
T\e got the course, and put the boat's head NW. by N. Tired after
a. sleepless night, hungry, sore, wet through to the skin, these truly Brit
ish sons of Neptune had vowed to get their admiral to his fleet in time,
and they set to with such good will that soon we were bowling alone
at four knots an hour. Luckily there was r.o wind, and the water was
as calm as a mill-pond. For a good hour we held on, and then on the
Fky-line astern we caught sight of a long, low streak of black, out of
which gradually grew the masts and hull of some small war-vessel.
\\e derided to signal her, and hoisted one of the men's flannels on the
loom of an oar to attract their attention.
Nearer and nearer came the vessel, and presently a tiny puff of
smoke, followed by a sharp report, told us that she had seen us.
Great Scot! She's a British gunboat, sir!" I cried, recognizing the
Dryad In the now rapidly approaching vessel.
And the Dryad she proved to be. and no sooner had we got aboard
and explained mattetrs than we found that fortune had not altogether
deserted us, after all.
For she was the bearer of new and important orders to Admiral Stan
hope, and it was indeed most fortunate that chance had prevented our
gaining the fleet before. The news she brought was the now historical
departure of Prince George of Greece for Crete, with his flotilla of tor
pedo-boats, in consequence of which the British Government had hastliy
countermanded the orders given the Ambassador, and decided to act with
the powers, for the time being, at all events. Instead of forcing the
Dardanelles we were to at once proceed to Canea, sending a few shtps
to the Piraeus in case of a blockade being decided on there. If the admiral
had got back in time, and opened fire on the Turkish flag, we should
have found ourselves in a very awkward predicament.
How the fleet carried out "the new orders, and with what result, the
world knows. But who shall say what might not have resulted but for
the admiral's misadventure?
â¢It was related to me by Mr A J. Cox, Chief Torpedo* Instructor, R. JC., now
serving in the Channel Fleet, and who was the only survivor of a party of men
concerned in the explosion on board her Majesty's ship Nile, at Bourdroum, in
the Levant, in June, 1K92 when a join-cotton chargre exploded through carelessness
in fitting a detonator that he was only three or four feet away when the accident
occurred, and that he suffered no in fury beyond being knocked down the ladrler

friend, whifli was as heartily returned.
"H^lln. Tom; so glad to see you and

"Weil, well, Jim. is this really you?
Then, with the real Shaughnessy twinkle
of the eye: "How under the heavens

sea captain to me the other day.
"Why, lots," I replied, "the briar

â ironwood, too, and one or two
others."
"I don't mean those," he said. "But
have you ever seen a lot of common

pulled from his pocket a morsel of what
looked like white Norwegian deal and
handed it to me. I was surprised at the
weight. "Put it in the gas flame," he
said.
I did so. But beyond a blackening of

Is Claimant to an Estate Worth Over a Million
DOLORES DE IAVEAGA is waiting anxiously for the 11th of
March. On that day she will learn her fate.
Perhaps srhe will be an heiress, enjoying all the luxury
and gilded ease that wealth makes possible.
Perhaps she will return to the "Tamale Gardens' in Fresno
to enjoy the few and simple pleasures that poverty makes possible.
"Dibs sabe!" says Dolores. And that little phrase is the alpha
-iid omega in the philosophy of her race.
â¢ ..If Pate has in store for her the golden spoon, muchas gracias!
.If notâ well, gracias too. For even to have had it held so deliciously
near has been bliss fcr Dolores. And if it melts into thin airâ there
is still the pretty little tamale garden, the doors of which will alway ;
Swing with welcome to Dolores. Then there is Rosa Benitez. Rosa,
." who writes to her "Lolatita" every day. For "Lola" is the sweet
: substitute that trips even, more sweetly than "Dolores" from the
southern tongue.
Rosa is not jealous of the good fortune that may be in store for
L-ola. < >h. no! not that. It is just because she is lonesome that the
laughter has died out of her soft brown eyes and her song does not
."ring as merrily as it used to.
So if Dolores does not get her carriage and four, if fickle Fortune
but flirting with her, she can go back to Rosa and be welcome.
But she is young- and beautiful and so far life's draught has been
bittersweet. And because of this Dolores cannot but believe that the
"perhaps" which is hanging over her will soon be a certainty.
The lawyers who are fighting her claim are even more sanguine
â¢of success. They are Messrs. Lloyd <Â£ Wood, Judge W. L. Pierce
Graves & Graves of San Luis Obispo. They aye waiting for
. March 14 almost as anxiously as is Dolores.
â  . On that day the Judge will decide whether Dolores de Laveaga
is to have a share of the estate left by Jose Vicente de Laveaga or
â¢whether the entire fortune is to be divided among Jose Vicente's ra-
. -rriaining brother and two sisters.
â¢ ' If he renders a favorable judgment it will give Dolcjres a goodly
. share of the millions left by Jose Vicente de Laveaga.
If /jotâ but why dwell on that? If not, says Dolores with a dainty
â .Â«lirug, "I shall not die of a broken hearf."
'.." Less than four months ago Dolores did not even know that Jose
Vicente de Laveaga was dead. In fact the name De Laveaga had
almost slipped her memory. It was not until a gentleman called at
the house and asked for Dolores de Laveaga that she remembered
â that she had some right to that aristocratic name.
Then she tried to brush away the cobwebs from her memories of
< hildhood and answer all his questions. And the result of his in
terrogation was that that very night Dolores packed her trunk,
kissed Rosa good-by and left for San Franpisco.
It was all very sudden and very strange this story that the
tleman told her on the way to the city. But' it appealed to her
love of romance and it appealed to her innate love of ease. So when
She was established in a pretty little suite in the Occidental Hotel
>bo sat down and wrote to Rosa. Rosa, who was idly swinging in a
hammock in the pretty garden, let slip a "Santa Maria!" when she
shed reading that letter.
And all Fresno opened wide its eyes when the story finally com-
I-d the rounds. For they did not know that Dolores, who had
lived among them ever since she was a little girl, was the heroine of
y that reads like a chapter from the romances of old.
Some time in the '60's the De Laveaga family moved from Mexico
San Francisco. Stnor de Laveaga was a power in the Mexican
colony. He had millions and he played grand senor with all the
pomp and ceremony that the title permitted. The De Laveaga
mansion in those days was on Pine street near Dupont. Three sons
and two daughters entertained there the younger members of the
â¢ aristocratic Mexican families.
Bright-eyed senoritas with subtle fascination waved their fans,
and dashing cavaliers sang or danced straight into the hearts of the
maidens. Youth and pleasure held high carnival. Senor de Laveaga
was lavish in his hospitality. But he never forgot that he was the
grand senor. Who knocked might enter at his feast â after the man
ner of his race. But only those were bidden whose family escutcheon
was as brilliant as his own.
' Jesusita Bustillos Ortez was not one of these. Her family was
poof and they dwelt in a tiny house within the formidable shadow
cast by the De Laveaga mansion. But in all the Mexican quarter
'there was not another girl as beautiful as Senora Ortez. Her husband
was dead and she had a pretty little child â Josefita Ortez.
Jn=e Maria de Laveaga, youngest son of the house of De Laveaga,
was not the only hidalgo who was captured by the beauty of Jesuscita
(>rtez. But he was the most devoted. No\v and then his friends met
rim strolling with the beautiful widow and her little girl. Once or
twice he was found fingering his guitar under her window. There
<ame a time when Jose absented himself entirely from the merry
rhakiogÃ in his own home.
"Jesusita Ortez!" said the c.-valiers, smilingly.
"Jesusita Ortez!" said the senoritas, angrily. For they knew
that some day Jose would have a share of his father's millions.
Benar de Laveaga was neither deaf nor blind to Jose's infatuation.
When he died in '74 he left Jose but the paltry sum of $75,000.
â¢Will he marry Jesusita now?" buzzed through the Mexican
plony. And under their breath they whispered: "Will Jose recognize
ihe child?" Â , .. ,
Foi two years before Senor de Laveaga died another baby voice
had wailed through the house of Jesuscita Ortez. She took two
children now instead of one for a daily walk. "Dolores." she named

hope. Then she cried the brightness from her eyes and crushed the
gladness out of her heart.
For six yeaTs she had waited and wept. Then one day there came
from Denver the news of Jose de Laveaga's death. He had abandoned
"Las Aguilas" and had gone to Denver to die in poverty.
Jesusita Ortez prayed night and day for the soul of her lover.
Her little hacking cough ripened into quick consumption. Not a year
after she heard that Jose was dead they buried her from the little
church of Guadaloupe.
SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY Â«J6, 1899.
Now that Jose Maria de Laveaga and Jesusita Ortez were dead
people spoke more kindly of their "affair."
"Maria Santisima! how she loved him!" said the sad-eyed mourn
ers \\ ho followed her to her grave. .
"Jose always meant to do something for her and the child, but
he was unlucky! " ?aid his friends.
It is on this evidence that the lawyers are claiming that Dolores
should inherit the share of Jose Maria in his uncla's big estate.
Don Felizardo Flores and Dona Carmen Garcia have testified
that they were in the house the night Dolores was born and that
Jose Maria de Laveaga recognized the parentage of the child. Other
witnesses have sworn that Jose Maria spoke often of his "daughter
Dolores," and what he intended to do for her.
After their mother died little Dolores and Josefita went to Fresno
to live with their uncle, Joaquin Cabrera. They attended public school
and both grew up into tall, beautiful girls. Dolores had all the rich,
vivid, brunette coloring of her race, but Josefita was slim and fragile,
with golden hair and big, frightened brown eyes. When" she was
but twenty-one the frightened brown eyes closed forever. Josefita,
like her mother, had died of quick consumption.
Joaquin Cabrera treated Dolores iike a daughter. She was never
called De Laveaga. In time she forgot the little snatches of her
mothers history that had fallen on her childish ears. Don Joaquin
Cabrera went to St. Louis to the horseraces and there he met his
death. Dolores lost in him her nearest and dearest relative.
Four years ago, when she was but twenty, Dolores went to Los
Angeles on a visit. There she met a gay senor who won her heart.
They married in haste and repented almost as quickly. Dolores re
turned to Fresno.
The pretty little tamale garden does not seem quite the same
since Lola is gone. It was not alone the excellence of the tamales
that drew the people there. True they were "bueno," but the two
senoritas who served them were "bonita." And while Rosa herself
is as pretty a little Mexican girl as ever drooped black lashes over
bright eyes* still they miss stately Dolores. Yet every one there hopes
that Lola will get her money and live happy ever afterward.
So Dolores de Laveaga waits for the 14th of March. "It is not the
mere money that I want," she says. "I love to help my friends and
I love pretty things. Isn't that natural?"
Of course it's natural for her to want to help her friends and to
love the lace mantilla and jeweled fan. She would not be a true
daughter of her ra<:e if she did not.
Of her mother she speaks tenderly and lovingly. "No, I have never
forgotten her. But not all the De Laveaga money can bring her
back to life and to me. She went to her grave because she loved
J Â° Se -If I the a cour^dectde a s in my favor I shall be happy and make my
friends happy. If not I will go back to Fresnoâ to Mrs. Cress and
Rosa, and with them I can never be unhappy.
'â¢Perhaps there is a fortune in store for meâ perhaps not.
"Quien sabe?"

GOSSIP OF A SOCIETY BUD
EAREST Margueriteâ As a Lenten
sacrifice I would suggest that you
D deprive yourself of my weekly
scribble. For thereby you would
forego your dearest pleasure, arid
I could rest from the arduous task of
i keeping your curiosity pitched up to the
| key of G. Pray consider it.
We are keeping Lent in the usual way.
Starving neither sin nor binâ which
i rhymes and has reason, too. It is really
I such a happy timeâ for we can escape the
ennui of formal affairs. It is during Lent
that we girls discover that we are not cut
out on identically the same pattern. Thai
! one gives up butter, the other sugar, and
I still another tea, does not prove this. For,
whisper it low, what we deprive our pal
ates of would not feed one Weary Willie.
But every hour of the day is not confis
cated by entertainers so we can let slip
the silken chains of social duties and give
our personalities a play-day. We golf,
ride, read, swim or enjoy a delicious dolce
i far niente, just as it pleases our caprice.
Nor do the thoughts of neglected social
invitations hang like millstones on our
consciences.
For, of course, no one is entertaining,
so simply by paying calls we come up to
the requirements of the Blue Book. As for
the requirements of the prayer book, w*
may be a little lax about the letter, but
we try to catch the spirit of the Lenten
season.
We "auxiliary" girls part our beloved
pompadours, put on our severest gowns
and meet once a week to do "plain sew
ing." I don't think I've ever told you
about the auxiliary. We organized two
years ago at the suggestion of one of the
girls. Our aim is to help the managers of
the Children's Hospital. One morning ot
each week, four of us, selected in turn, go
out to the hospital to amuse the children.
We read to them, sing, talk, play with
them bring them flowers, do anything
that will brighten their lives. We grow
so fond of the little darlings that if wiso
parents did not interfere we would adopt
Half of them. *
Last year during Lent we .made a
"comfy" sacque for every child 1 in tnu
hospital. Delicate little pink and oluÂ«
affairs that were slipped over the night
ies of the little tots when they sat up
in their beds on Easter morning to listen
to the sweet carols and beautiful service.
The "auxiliary" met for the first tim<;
this year on Ash Wednesday at Theres.:
Morgan's. Mrs. Merrill gave us a little
talk about our work that made us each
and every one decide to do ten times
more than we did last year.
We elected Mrs. Merrill honorary presi
dent, and insisted on Laura Bates ac
cepting the active presidency Both of
the Bates girls are such fine work
ere that we elected Gertrude Bates
treasurer. Miss Carolan is vice presi
dent and Helen Hopkins is second vice
president. Therese Morgan undertook the
duties of secretary.
We determined to endow a bed in the
hospital, and in a sweet outburst of un-
Fflfish generosity then and there enough
was promised to maintain the bed.
This (Wednesday) morning we met at
Miss Hagar's to -make the sheets and
pillow-cases, mark the towels and do all
the other necessary things. We are to
meet at a different girl's house every
President, Mrs. Louis Weinmann; vice
presidentsâ Mrs. Dorvtlle Libby, Mrs. H.
J. Sadler; recording secretary, Mrs. Irv
ing F. Moulton; corresponding secretary.
Mips Henrietta Stadtmuller; treasurer.
Mrs. R. Cannany; directorsâ Mrs. Nathan
Frank. Mrs. Ella M. Sexton, Mrs. A. W.
Jackson, Mrs. J. Brandt and Mrs. T. W.
Collins. After the installation an inter
esting talk upon the "Enchanted Mesa"
of New Mexico was given by Professor
David Starr Jordan.
A fancy dress masquerade party was
given recently by Mr. and Mrs. J. H.
Cousins in honor of the eleventh anni
versary of their marriage at their home.
1317 Ninth street, Alameda. The evening
was spent in dancing, singing and recita
tions, followed by a most delightful sup
per. Those present were: Mr. and Mrs.
J. H. Cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Lewis, Mr.
and Mrs. W. Hogan, Mr. and Mrs.
Thompson, Mr. and Mrs. Abt. Miss Helene
Abt, Miss McDermit, Miss L. Hess, the
Misses Cooke. Miss Jennie Schrader, Miss
Lillian Ellsworth. L. Cummings, E. M.
Brown, Mr. Cooke. Joseph Boyhan, H.
Wednesday morning and sew until all is
finished, it will take some time, but the
enthusiasm is too genuine to wane.
Some of the girls really sew beautiful
ly, and those who do not are regarding
finger pricks as honorable scars. This
sort of work gives our thoughts a new
bent and though we sew steadily to the
constant flatter of tongues it is not the
usual weak tea gossipy chatter.
Besides the officers the girls who be
long are Cora Crockett, Edna Hopkins,
Cora Rmedberg. Bertha Smith. Bernie
Drown, Lillie Follls, Ella Morgan, Miss
Eyre, Misa Houghtoh and the Moore girls.
Edith McÃean and the Thomas girls be
long, but they are away at present. No
wonder we enjoy our work and meetings,
for we are all very sympathetic.
Some , of the girls go to church, every
day. but most of us think three times a
week a respectable average. . Then we .are
playing golf with a devotion that 1 " Dick
says should be turned toward a nobler
meaning himself. Saturday morn
ing almost every girl who professes to
know a golf stick I from ja- croquet mallet
was out at the links. :.â  \ ''â -',
The officers on the lowa are returning
the little courtesies that have been shown
them with true naval hospitality, which
is as big as the ocean. On Thursday they
entertained members from the clubs. And
it was not a case of "water, water every
where, but not a drop to drink." The Bo
hemian Club men who were there had
their pleasure spoiled, however, for they
learned on their return of Dan O'Connell's
death. ; . : ......
Saturday night a great many went out
to the entertainment the sailors gave on
board ship. The girls declared it very
unique and enjoyable and' Jolly Jack. Tar
was voted a success in â¢ vaudeville..
Speaking of things nautical reminds me
that several of the girls > have received
letters from the Annapolis boys who are
cadets on the Oregon. You know the Or
egon has been in , tropical waters :â¢ for a
year and the boys are all sick with the
maladies and fevers of those climes. Now
they are ordered 'off to Manila without
getting a whiff of ; temperate breezes.
Alice, who has a cousin on board, says
that people ; are calling, attention to the
fact that the boys should be relieved and
fresh ones sent on to fill their places. We
certaifily^ can't : afford to ! lose them. â  i
Ethel % Keeney and . Leontine Blakeman
are back from. St. Louis. They say they
are glad to ,be home, but .' . /And ' that

DO WOMEN PROPOSE?
TO remark even casually to the av
erage woman that if she is married
she undoubtedly did the proposing
is to receiving a snapping denial.
The truth of the assertion will sur
vive nevertheless, and that "she"
does the proposing all men will gravely
assert. This chat was heard at a well
known club not long since:
"Well. Jack, Mary B. knows I am in
love with her, and if she gave me half a
chance 1 would ask her to marry me.
But she won't. She keeps herself incased
in engagements; says, "Oh, I'm sorry,
but I promised to meet so-and-so,' every
time I bid fo.r an hour with her. But"â
between puffsâ "I guess she isn't ready
to propose yet; waiting for a new gown
or some other stand-off."
Experienced devotees of the fair sex say
the widows are more expert at proposing
marriage than the debutante or reasonably
up to date society girl. But the widow is
a hard proposition to cope with. She feels
it eminently her privilege to "coo" over a
man. say sweet things en passant to him,
tell him he is the sweetest thing in town,
make him so absolutely comfortable that
he dreads renewed acquaintance with his
bachelor apartments. All the ' time the
idea of love or marriage would cause her
to laugh as an absurdity too far uway
even to glance at.
The widow is dangerous. She knows
how to manage a man with skillful tact.
If she decides to marry him she will, and
he is helpless.

shapeless but in reality are most carefully
cut and fitted. If not they are entirely

They should always be made with warm

and lace. If the ribbon and lace are of
excellent quality it is wasting good ma
tt rial on a poor foundation. If they are
not it is a still more unpardonable crime.
For shabby finery is the most heinous sin
committed in fashion's name.
From gown? and wrap? to headgear, of
course. A "sham bonnet." if one must
come in the oar. and uncovered head if
one has a carriage at beck and call. The
sham bonnet Is dressed in with tne hair
and t annot be removed. It is a combina
tion of the milliner's and hairdrsesser's
craftâ in fact, a bonnet deftly built on the
locks without the legitimate bonnet
frame. This sham 'bonnet will be a
source of constant joy. The disguise of a
headgear, snatched off at the rise of the
curtain, and later awkwardly readjusted
at random, will- soon be a forgotten
shame.
Flowprs. aigrettes, wired ribbon and
jeweled combs will flourish undisturbed
on well satisfied heads, one simple rule
holding good for all. That rule is that the
hair must serve as a frame, and if a roll
of velvet, silk or satin form a crown the
hair shall show through it. In whatever
arrangement the uncovered hair must be
a feature.
The "donkey-eared" bow is one of the
most girlish "sham bonnets." The velvet
is shaped into four tiny sharp "donkey
ears" and lined with satin. A folded
bias piece of the same velvet is looped
around the knot of hair and is twisted in
front to form the center of the double
donkey-eared bow.
Another pretty style is to substitute two
pairs of dainty, tiny wings for the donkey
ears. The hair should be parted in the
middle and waved loosely over the side
pompadour rolls. The wings must droop
slightly at the tips and the upper pairs
ars a trifle shorter than- the lower ones.
The knot and roll encircling the hair are
this style made of black velvet tulle, with
a semi-coronet of cut steel or rhinestones
surmounting the knot of fabric directly in
front.
For the debutante is an appropriately
youthful and simple decoration devoid of
jewels. Just an aigrette rising from a
bunch of roses. The roses may oe double
or single, but are exaggeratedly large and
have the stems concealed in the pompa
dour.
The most matronly of the sham bon
nets is called the Louis XVI. The hair la
brushed over a pompadour roll that com
pletely encircles the "head. It is then
dressed tyi a loose knot, the ends of which
are curled and pinned flatly down to the
knot. A twist of black velvet twined
around the knot is finished off in front
with a Louis XVI bow. The latter is the
novel part of the head dress. It is made
of white tulle, carefully wired at the
edges under a piping of black velvet. Pas
tiles of black velvet are appliqued to the
tulle, which Is then bent and crinkled into
the fashionable Louis XVI. Mock Jewels
or spangles may be effectively substituted
for the velvet dots.

Frills of Fashions.
In the first place it Is evident that only
the lightest and most delicate colorings
will be used. There are palest fawn, faint
est hedge sparrow-egg blue, the most
delicate tints of green. AH these shades
will be fashionable, although distinctly.
to my mind, the fawn and pale gray
shades are the best and most becoming.
The cloth used is an entirely new material
called pastelle; a sort of stuff that is most
delicately soft and light, and having
neither cord nor grain. It is made up with
extreme simplicity, sometimes merely
strapped or bound with white satin and
trimmed with a multiplicity of .narrow
stitchings in white, fir else worn with one
of those long, sweeping, princess-shaped
overdresses in guipure lace.

Girls who affect long redlngotes with
slanting side pockets In front of the hips
are wearing chatelaines, with the pin fas
tened inside of the pocket and the metal
trinkets seemingly tumbling out in merry
jingle jangle. Out of the same pocket, and
uk securely fastened in, puffs the frill of
a priceless lace kerchief.
The wash silks, otherwise known as
silk cheviots, abound among spring im
portations. The new patterns are ex
tremely pretty, many of them showing
the- pin and polka-dotted designs so uni
versally popular. Others are in soft
shades, in stripes of rose -color and reseda,
russet and damask red, pale violet and
chamois color, two distinct shades of
blue or green, etc. The silks, in tiny
hair lines and dots, will be used in the
manner first introduced by Paris and
London tailors, a trim, perfectly fitted
shirt waist being added to traveling,
morning and tennis costumes of woolen
or light " weight cloth. The jacket en
suite this year is close fitting and short,
and this, with the tailor skirt, is formed
of silky English serge, which costs $1 50
a yard*, but is extra wide, requiring a
very little material for both jacket and
gored skirt.
Late flounces will trim the bottom of
plain skirts. A form of lace especially
prepared for flouncing is in a slightly cir
cular shape and is called the "godef
flouncing. These conform to the shape of
the skirt without being gatfiered or pleat
ed This make can also be used with
great effect in the formation of cascades
and other styles of trimming, not only
for skirts but for waists.

BECOMING
COLORS
"Tell you how to choose becoming col
ors?" said William Chase, the famous ar
tist. "Do you know that is ahout the
hardest question I have ever been called
upon to answer? Why, artists study years
to acquire such knowledge, and many of
us descend to our graves feeling we have
not mastered the secret.
"The art of dressing well does not de
pend on the selection of colors alone, but
on the form. I will illustrate: Take the
costumes worn in Trelawny of the Weljs.
The colors are beautiful and the effect at
tractive, but they are not graceful. The
old Greeks are the ones women snoukl
study when seeking graceful effects, and
if they wish harmony of colors, let them
study* old Japanese prints.
"Of course, blondes should aiways
choose what are known among artists as
cool colors; for example, blues, pinks,
greens the many shades of violet, also
white or black. Brunettes have all the
warm tonesâ yellow, orange, red, with
a few purples and bluesâ to select from.
"It is more difficult for^a blonde than a
brunette to dress becomingly. All women
â with light hair or eyes fancy they should
wear blue, especially delicate^ tints of
azure, whereas very few of them can at
tempt it successfully. Only blondes with
perfect complexions ought ever attempt
pale blues. Yet it is very generally be
coming to brunettes. Such women do not

need perfect complexions, as it throws
out what little color they may have in
cheeks and lips and has the effect of
clearing the skin. ,
"The same may be said of delicate
shades of yellow, while the reverse Is true
of pink. 'Almost any type excepting a
very red blonde â I mean one with a florid
skinâ may wear pink safely, whereas the
brunette or brown-haired woman has to
be careful to secure the right shade. She
need* a pink with a suggestion of yellow.

However, revenons a nos moutons.
Those distressing little spots that come
out on the face arise from various causes,
and, though generally easy to remove,
they sometimes exhibit an obstinacy
equal to that of the proverbial mule. They
are usually an indication of some physical
disorder; either a derangement of tne
digestive apparatus, caused by injudicious
eating; an impure condition of the blood,
or they may come from a neglect of the
laws of hygiene. Sometimes they are sim
ply local irritations. So the more rational
plan Is to find the seat of the trouble and
remedy that. Instead of dabbing all sorts
of ointments and lotions on the face. The
chances are that the local applications
will rot do a particle of good. for. so
long as the cause remains, the effect
will likely travel right along in its trail.
With nine women out of ten the cau&e
ravages of time in the cruekst way.
Whenever the concealment of age is a
consideration it should be avoided.
â  "Moreover, let every woman bear in
mind that pink and red should be worn
above in preference to below the face. I
never saw a woman who was improved
by one of those pink or red collars they
are wearing nowâ what do you call them"
Stocks. Well, red and pink stocks take
the color out of the face, and as a rule
make the complexion yellow.
"But the strangest mistake to me is that
women insist on wearing a color simply
because it is fashionable and without any
regard to becomingness. I remember
once being called on to paint a girl, quite
a pretty "Jewess she was. and dark, of
course, "who wore a horrible blue waist.
I mean horrible for her. Why, I couldn't
see the girl' 6 face for that detestable bod
ice seemed to shriek and scream at me.
I remonstrated, but she declined to make
a change, owing to the extreme fashion
ableness of the color. What can we ar
tists do when ladies think more of fash
ion than taste!
"If j'ou clever shoppers would only take
the goods before buying, throw it against
the face and use your eyes, you could
easily decide whether or no a color was
becoming. When you do chance to have
an unbecoming tone the effect can bo
modified by using white or cream near the
face. White for blondes and cream for
brunettes. That is a point which all
women will do well to remember â only the
fairest and best cured for blondes should
risk ivory white. All other had best ding
to cream tints.
"Dark greens, blues and purples must
never be attempted by women who have
dark circles under the eyes, or whose
faces have a tendency to hollows. Such
women need flame red, for instance.
"A red-haired woman had best shun all
the reds. Though missing some beautiful
shades, I think she has a wider range
to select from than any other type, un
less it is the brilliant brunette.
"Pale or delicate looking women seldom
look well in any of the grays, tans or
fawns unless they are very skillfully com
bined with warm colors.
"Of course no woman whose hair has
the slightest suggestion of gold or sun
shine should wear yellow next it. Noth
ing takes away the color and luster so
completely. Various shades of red and
the lighter blues look well; then, of
course, white or a bit of bright purple,
but not other colors. Well, I think it
safest for the majority to avoid using
them in the hair.
"From the standpoint of an artist -I ad
mire white and black gowns more than
any other. When properly designed I
have never seen a woman to whom such
a dress was unbecoming."

good, wholesome nourishing, beautifying
food into your stomach as it is to over

GOWNS FOR
TRAVELING
A feature of the traveling dress as it
is now in its perfection is its long coat.
Tailors turn out cloth gowns in three
piecesâ skirt, shirt and highwayman coat.
The skirt in this instance is just one of
the close-fitting popular affairs.
The shirt is silk or wool, as you please,
but the coat is the thing. It drops well
nigh to the heel, fits the body snugly clear
up to the chin, takes the hips without a
wrinkle, but below it falls in a sort of un
conscious drapery.
Sometimes it closes with a fly-front and
concealed buttons, all seams strapped,
and the hem turned up a little above the
skirt's foot and straight around.
In other cases it closes with a series of
handsome braid ornaments trom shoulder
down ,and is artistically shaped, irregu
larly at the bottom, shorter in front than
behind. Any way you please to have it,
the long coat is predominant and a nec
essary part not only of the spring trav
eler's wardrobe, but belongs in that of
the stay-at-homes.
Under the chin such a coat comes with
in two buttons of the neck, turns back
tiny notched revers. and shows a tie of
gay color on a ripple of cream lace be
tokening the stock shirt beneath.

utmost gentleness. Pimples must never
be irritated. Breaking and bruising the
skin only adds to its diseased condition
and rubbing with a coarse towel is the
worst treatment In the world.
When the face is covered with red
blotches, use this wash: One ounce gly
cerine, one-half ounce rosemary water
and fifteen drops of carbolic acid. Its ap
plication should, of course, be combined
with proper living. Certain articles of
food, such as hot bread, buckwheat cakes,
pastry, cheese, nuts, chocolate and all
sweet, fried and highly seasoned foods,
also wines and beer, have an especial
tendency toward producing pimples, and
should therefore be rigidly excluded from
the dietary. Systematic bnthing and
plenty of exercise in the open air are also
of much importance in effecting a cure.
A good cold cream should also be used.
V'hen the skin is merely Inflamedâ that
is. red of color and very tender â a lotion
made of rosewater combined with 2 per
<ir,i of its bulk of carbolic acid will prove
effective.
When the eruptions come to a tiny white
head, they must be carefully opened with
a line needle and the contents gently
pressed out. If this is followed by con
siderable cutaneous irritation, touch the
spots with tincture of myrrh; if the irri
tation is but slight, an application of cold
rrcim is all that will be necessary. Lis
terine diluted in three times as much
boiled water will be fou"nd to be very heal
ing to any sort of a cutaneous eruption.
A small "pinch of borax in two table
spoonfuls of cologne is also good. Use
the listerine for several nights, and then
the borax and cologne for several nights.
There is a peculiar form of eruption

that sometimes appears on the forehead
and about the nose. It has the appear
ance of tiny seed-pearls imbedded in the
skin and is caused by the obstruction of
the sebaceous glands. These being un
able to rid themselves of their contents
distend and become hardened and promi

puncture each separately and squeeze out
the contents. The empty gland may ap

A paste made of flour of sulphur and

porarily almost any sort of pimple.
Answers to Correspondents.
EMMA WILLIAMSâ Give the face a
good scrubbing each night with a com
plexion bru&h, tepid water and castile
soap. Rinse and dry thoroughly and then
rub into the skin a good 4 pure cold cream.
A little powdered borax on a bit of linen,
rubbed tightly over the black heads, will
also help. ,
BATHILDE Xâ Boil slowly an ounce or
walnut bark in a pint of water for an
hour. "Set 1 the* dye by adding, a lump
of alum the size of a hazel nut. Keep
this in a bottle and apply to the eye
brows with a small camel's hair brush. I
think this will give the desired tint. Be
careful not to get the liquid on the skin,
as it will stain it.
CLARAâ I cannot give addresses in
these columns, but if you will send me a
stamped addressed envelope I will with
pleasure give you the name of a compe
tent masseuse. I cannot understand why
you have not had better results from the
skin food. Dozens of my correspondents
have written me that it has worked won
ders with their complexions. I am sure
the difficulty with you must be that you
do not use the right movements in mas
saging If your chin became flabby it
muÂ«t be because you rolled or pinched the
flesh when giving the massage, or your
illness may account for its getting in that
condition. The alum bath is to be given
after the massage, when the skin has
absorbedsthe skin food.
INEZ Hâ l am delighted that the orange
flower skin food has proved so satisfac
tory You might try witch hazel on the
little red veins, followed by massage with
the skin food, but really I do not think
there is any positive cure for them. Am
sorry. In my beauty talk of January 21
I told all about the removal of moles. As
your letter was written January 20 I feel
more than certain that you saw it.
GERALDINAâ The hair was considered
In the Beauty Talk a couple of Sundays
ago. Use the following tonic: Forty
eight grains resorcin, one-half ounce gly
cerine and alc<shol to fill a two-ounce
bottle. Apply every night, rubbing it well
into the scalp. This will remove the
dandruff and inspire the falling locks with
an ambition to stick to your head. When
the hair falls it is. wiser not to brush it
very vigorously.
HELEN HUNTâ Please read to-day s
Beauty Talk for information concerning
treatment of pimples. You can use the
skin food for the neck all right, but think
you will get quicker results by massaging
with equal parts of lanolin, cocoanut oil
and cocoa butter, melted together. In the
morning bathe the neck with tepid water
and rub briskly with a rough towel until
the flesh is all rosy from the friction.
The only trouble in using the skin food
on the eyelashes is that you are apt to
get it in the eyes, which would probably
irritate and inflame them.
F. H.â Please try this astringent wash
for the coarse pores: Take a half pint
bottle and place in it three tablespoonsful
of fresh, uncooked cucumber juice. Half
fill the bottle with elderflower water and
then add two tablespoonsful of eau de
cologne. Shake well and add very slowly
half an ounce of simple tincture of ben
zoin, shaking the mixture now and then.
Fill the bottle with elderflower water. Be
Sure that there are no settlings in the
benzoin.else it will be apt to curdle the
lotion. Use two or three times a day. let
ting it dry on the skin. Use the following
lotion on.'the face before applying powder.
It is quickly absorbed by the skin and
will make the powder stick nicely: Gum
tragaeanth, whole, 30 grains; rosewater,
7 ounces; glycerine, one-half ounce; alco
hol, one-half ounce. Soften the traga
eanth in the rosewater for a day or two,
and strain forcibly through muslin or
cheesecloth. Then add glycerin and al
cohol, previously mixed, shake well and
perfume to suit. Be sure that your pow
der is pure and of the best quality. If it
is not it will surely roughen your skin.
ANXIOUSâ First of all. discard all
pads. Then follow directions siren in
foregoing reply to Helen Hunt, treating
the bust in the same manner.
MYRTLE Hâ l am very sorry, but I
haven't the faintest idea who the doctor
is that you icfer to. Nor do I know of
any one" in this city who performs the
operation you mention. Why do you not
try to get* rid of your wrinkles by feed
ing the tissues a"nd strengthening the
muscles? This can be done by systematic
massage with the orange flower skin food.
I should never advise the cutting method.
For the coarse pores, bathe the face al
ways in cold water, and use the astrin
gent wash suggested to F. H. They are
very obstinate always. The diet has a
great deal to do with their coming. The
food must be free from fat or grease if
the skin is to be refined and nice.

M. B.â ln Sunday's Call, February 12.
there appeared a special Beauty Talk on
the care of the hair. I hope you found
in it something that entirely fitted your
case.
INQUISITIVEâ The recipe that you
wish calls for equal parts of lanolin,
cocoanut oil and cocoa butter, melted to
gether. Please read foregoing replies to
Helen Hunt and Anxious.
BROWN EYESâ HaIf a teaspoonful of
ammonia, to a tablespoonful of pr-roxide
of hydrogen is about the proper propor
tion.
NETTIE J.â The tonic that you had
prepared should not make the hair
greasy, particularly if you are careful to
apply it only to the scalp and not to the
txair Itself. When the hair is excessively
oily or the scalp unusually ?rowded with
dandruff, it should be shampooed once
a week, and occasionally an egg sham
poo is more beneficial than the usual
one of soap. The simplest recipe is the
yolk of an egg. thoroughly beaten, in one
ounce of rosemary spirits and one pint
of very warm water. Rinse well in. sev
eral waters. I sincerely hope that this
tr. :itment will benefit you.
DOLORES B.â To-day's Beauty Talk
will answer your question.
A. I. D. W.-I am very sorry, but I
could rot make out your letter.
AN INQUIRERâ Whon the face Is too
red for comfort much of the color can
be got rid of by active pedestrtanlsm, ,t
well-ventilated bedioom, no tight bands
or corsets and a diet of ripe pears,
oranges and figs. Put the hands and feet
in hoi water, in which is a a little
mustard powder, every night. Avoid hot
drinks, eat very slowly and be out in the
open air as much as possible.
PANSY BLOSSOMâ You need have no
ft-ars in using the peroxide of hydrogen
on the superfluous hair. Add to It a
s-mall quantity of ammonia. This will
deaden the bairs in time and so check
their growth.

ressârich, witty, a trifle passee, perhaps,
but a superb match!"
Her little fat eyes gleamed with antici
pation. It was clear I was to be victim
ized, but it would be worth something to
see it out.
"Monsieur," she went on,, in a manner
meant to be tempting, "with women who
have lost their class there is no disad
vantage at all. There are no notaries or
guardians to divide with and no parents
to be inquisitive about the spending of
the dot. You deal frankly with themâ
no treason! no heart mysteries! no de
ceptions! She will sa> to you. 'Yes, 1
I have had romances. It was the Prince de
j G. or the Marquis de Y. But let us not
speak of that. Let us speak of the fu
ture, not the past.' That is what she will
say to you. And ha? she not the right to
impose conditions? . She has money. She
can choose her husband. You are not the
only one who offers himself. There are
nobles!"
"Authentic nobles?"
"Authentic, authentic? I do not know.
No one insists on that. Only if you were j
titled, with a real baptismal register, you j
could make one of these rich marriages
immediately. If your father had only put
a 'de' to his nameâ but I forget; you are a
foreigner."
"Then how shall I succeed against three
noblemen?"
"Appear to he serious, intelligent, hon
est! These ladk-s are always afraid their
husbands will waste their money. They
want honest husbands, good young men;
proper, respectable, honorable. That is
the style for you. young man. Appear to
be intelligent. Pretend y>u are a journal
ist. Another thing, and it is a little deli
cate. Are you good?"
"How â good?"
"Are you sound in wind and limb?"
"I should hope so, at my age "
"So much the betterâ butâ m-m-m. one
can never be sure. Young men are not
always what they should be nowadays.
They drink too much, they smoke too
much, they keep late hours. Tf you are
good, so murh the better. I have a wile
for you. a beauty and she will make your
life a paradise. Fifty francs, now, in ad
vance."
I paid her 35.
Thirty-five francs is $7.
She gave me an appointment with tht>
lady in one of the interminable picture
galleries of the. Louvre.
"One instant," T begged. "What is her
character of mind? How shall 1 fit my
conversation to her taste? Shall T talk of
the theater, politics, travel, music, litera
ture or the remembrances of my child
hood? Does she desire to be amused or
have her heart touched?"
"Between the two."
I went to the Louvre and waited. The
lady came! She was really beautiful,
dressed with quiet elegance. She had
charming manners, almost timid. She |
could not have been more than 32 years
old. Madame, the matchmaker, was with
her. She presented me and walked away.
The charming "lady with a past" sat
down. We Bpoke a few moments, I think,
of the grandeur of my native land and
the happiness of American wives. "Oh,
Mon .Dieu!" she interrupted. "It is 4
o'clock, and I have an engagement with
my dressmaker at 3:30! Bon jour! An
other time!"
That was all. I think there was no mar
riage .intended. I think the beautiful lady
is already married. She is good and re
spectable. She needs pocket money, and
the marriage broker gives her half the
proceeds of each deal. Otherwiseâ but
otherwise I do not like to think of it. It
is not flattering to the man who paid his
35 'francs clownâ for a rich Parisian wife.

the ambitious series of improve

dent that the amount of expense
incident upon the rebuilding and refur
â¢ rushing of the big theater did not enter
â into the rir?" calculation of its man
- ager.- Th* 1 entire interior has been torn
â¢out and the system of improvement will i
be surpassingly fine when it is finished !
â¢ and the auditorium stands ready to fur- !
nish the scene for great voices, thrill- j

mammoth in its new proportion. It
will contain as many seats as the Met

and fully 50 per cent more than three

over 1000 seats on the lower floor and j

A feature of the lower floor will be
: The absence of any steps, the audience

gently slopes toward the front and in j
shape has the appearance of a huge j

front have been built "palco" boxes,

entire theater. The dividing partitions

plush which will be the pervading tint

Th< heavy partitions which formerly
these boxes have been re
moved and there is a partition of about
two feet high dividing them. They
will be lighted 'with electricity and
richly but plainly furnished and decor
ated. Wall coverings will be of a red
dish color and conform to the prevail
ing tint of the decoration all. over the
interior, which favors a terra cotta red
and verges to a lighter tint of this color
schema. It has been the experience in
decorating all unusually large inte
that a shade of red is at once the most
satisfying and the most cheerful, and
that the Warmth of the atmosphere so
particularly lacking in some big audi
toriums Is best obtained in combining
the red cofors. TneYe will be over L6OO
- upon the orchestra and dress cir
cle floors, and there will be about 160
chairs in palco and prop.' ;ium. The
family circle and the gallery will be
arranged to best suit the convenience
of the patrons of those sections of the
house, and a regular reserved seat plan
has been prepared for the family cir
cle. The view of the stage from these
parts of the theater will be just as
sweeping as it is from any of the lower
floors.
The lobbies, reception rooms and
other special apartments of the opera
house have undergone a transforma
tion. The decorators have been devot
ing their special efforts to the painting
of suitable designs upon these parts
of the theater. There trill be an en
tirely new drop curtain, now being
painted by a well-known artist, and the
ceilings of the lobbies, and especially
those in the centra ccurt, have been
covered with paintings.
The system of electric lighting now
being installed will be as complete as
skill and material can make it. It is
estimated that almost Hvs thousand
electric lights can be put into service
I before and behind the footlights, and
the effect will be one of surpassing bril-
Ky. Behind the stage is being built
of the largest electric switch
d? ever constructed for theatrical
oses and will bs able to respond to
lest demands upon its lighting
For the first lime in its
tricai history San Francisco will
ess a great stage perfectly
pped with all the advantages of an
electric lighting plant of practically
limitless capacity.
The theater and the season seem most
propitious for the triumph of the com
ing operatic performances. The history
of gr^at seasons in this city show 3 that
the biggest attractions have come to
San Francisco in the early spring.

Francisco is to see a new Floria Tosca,
and a new Fedora, in the person of Miss
Walsh. Miss Walsh is no stranger to this
city but she has never appeared here
until this season in the roles calling for
such an equipment of youth, feminine
beauty and talent and a considerable
amount of real histrionic genius. It is
generally acknowledged that Miss Walsh
is the possessor of those qualities so es
sential to great success upon the stage.
and has discovered how to apply
them in order to get the best pos
sible results, at least, this seems to be the
verdict wherever the company has ap
peared this year. Melbourne MacDowell
Will be welcome in this city. La Tosca
is to be the bill for the first week of the
engagement, and "Fedora" will be staged
during the second.
J\\e California.
Nance O'Neil is to be the attraction at
the California Theater for seven nights
and Saturday matinee, beginning to-mor
row night. The young tragedienne is
booked for an early London appearance
and many local theater goers, before her
departure, have signed/a petition for her
appearance during the coming week, and
the management have arranged for a
repertoire which includes the star's best
impersonations. Miss O'Neil has already
given evidence of her right to play
Budermann's "Magda," and her previous
success here in that role has induced her
to make it the opening bill of her fare
well engagement. "Magda" will be re
peated on Thursday night. McKee Ran
. kin will again be seen as the father and
Herbert Carr as the young rector. For
the first time here on Tuesday and Sun
day evenings the actress will appear as
Lady Isabel in the new version of "East
Lynhe."
On Wednesday evening the play is to
be "Ingomar." with its gentle Parthema.
and nn Friday evening Miss O'Neil will
appear as Leah in "The Jewess." "Ca
mille" will be given for the one and only
time during the engagement on Saturday
afternoon and will no doubt prove a
strong matinee bill. On Saturday night
the realistic production of Oliver Twist,
with Miss O'Neil as Nancy Sykes. and
McKee Rankin as Bill Sykes, will be
staged. ,

Vaudeville at the Comedy Theater this
week. The management has decided to
try it for a week, and has secured the
John L. â¢ Sullivan Comedy Company,
which is headed by the people's cham
pion . himself. Although the big fellow
has appeared with some big organizations
it has only been within the past two
years that he has headed his own com
pany, his previous traveling having been
as a special feature with some dramatic
show. This season he has an entirely
new company. The programme opens
with a musical burletta entitled A Trip
Across the Ocean." The champion Is in
troduced as a captain in a natty yachting
costume. The second part is an Olio of
eight numbers, in which Edwards and Ed
wards appear in â¢ illustrated son* s :
Rochefort and May in songs, parodies and
funny sayings; Fetching brothers as mu
sical comedians; Millie Bartne Francis
in athletic marvels, closing with a three
round spirited sparring contest. rn< con
cluding number on the programme will be
a gymnasium scene in which John L.. bui
livan, ex-champion heavy-weight of
America, will show the different methods
used by prominent fighters while training
for contests,, and will close with a three
round scientific sparring bout. ... . a
Janet Waldorf, the young legitimate
American actress, will play a week s en
gagement, commencing Sunday. March a.
Jhe OrpKeum.
- The Orpheum's bill for this week is
headed by Cora Tanner, whose name is
familiar to the theater-goers of America.
'She has been at the head of several of
the best known dramatic companies in
the country, and she has but recently
gone into vaudeville. She comes to the
Orpheum in a one-act comedy by Lloyd
Grand entitled "My Husband s Model, in
which Miss Tanner, of course, appears
as the model. For the part shÂ« is em
inently qualified, for it was not the press
agent, the conjuror of adjectives, but the
cold, cynic critic of the New \ork Sun
who said. "Miss Tanner is a buxoml> .
beauteous being, and has lost nothingâ
not a curve." She is assisted by Louis
Massen, and their act is said to be up
roariously funny. The Four Eddys Eu
ropean acrobats, are also said to be un
usually clever, and are credited with do
ing some work not attempted by others.
The Hulines. musical grotesques, are also
new. The hold-overs are J. K. Murray
and Clara Lane. Edith Cras^e. Bloom
and Cooper and De Haven and Male.
Sousa's Band.
Sousaand his band are announced for
appearance at the Alhambra, corner Eddy
and Jones streets, for three nights and
Saturday and Sunday matinees, beginning
Friday evening. March 3. Aside from the
superb discipline of the Sousa band, the
excellence of its ensemble playing is
largely due to the fact that since its or
ganization in the summer of 1592 there
have been comparatively few changes in
its personnel. Year in and year out the
same instrumentalists have remained un
der the "March King's" direction, assim
ilating his ideas and rounding out and
perfecting the artistic balance of the
band.
The Ghutes.
"We are modest, but we have the best
show on earth." is the top line in the
Chutes' poster for the new week. Violet
Dale has made a big hit and will con
tinue to kick and dance to the delight of
the crowd. Pianka and her lions are in
their last week. The Passion Play is still
on and William Sapp. tthe ossified man.
says that he can't kick at the crowds
that come to see him. Australian Igua
nas has just been introduced to society
in the Zoo. and. the amateur ballet will
caper again Thursday night.

The Olympia has a number of cards, in
cluding Sherman and Morrisey, acrobatic
comedians, in their laughable skit; Que
rita Vincent in her pleasing dances and
Lynwood, the European contortionist.

Reopening of the /\lhambra.
The Alhambra will reopen Monday
evening, March 6, under the manage
ment of Messrs. E. J. Holden, Henry
Mac Donald and T. H. Kilgo as a popu
lar-priced theater. Mr. Holden, who
has been absent for the past six weeks
in New York, returns t-his evening
with a complete stock dramatic com
pany, which he has engaged there. It
includes Laura Alberta, one of the best
known leading actresses in this coun
try; Florence Rossland, a very clever
soubrette; DeWitt Clinton, a handsome
young romantic leading actor, who en
joys a very enviable reputation in the
East; Joseph L. Tracy and William T.
Doyle, excellent exponents of heavy
and character roles, and Charles Swain,
who will be remembered as the most
popular low comedian Morosco ever
had. During his three years of absence
Mr. Swain has greatly distinguished
himself, especially in New York, where
he made a very great hit in "The
Geisha" at Daly's Theater. For the
opening a new patriotic naval drama,
entitled "Dewey: or the Hero of Ma
nila," will be produced. It is meeting
with great success in the'Enst and the
management promise it a very elabor
ate and complete production.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW STORK, Feb. 25.â The stock market
worked fractionally lower to-day on dealings
of a million shares during the short session.
The Philippine situation continued to be used
as a bear argument with the professional ele
ment, which was largely in control of the
market. There were various rumors afloat
favorable to the Specialties, but lack
ing of confirmation. Outsiders were
said to have given assurances that
the regular dividend disbursement might
in Sugar, and forthwith the stock
:. â â¢ points from the lowest. It was
i Tobacco earnings were large and
that the company was hacking those securing
a ntrol of the Cuban cisarmaking plants, but
this was in a measure offset by denials from
Union Tobacco Company sources that there
would be a consolidation with the American*
i Company, which made only a frac
tional u-ain.
Reports of the acquisition of other concerns
and earnings gossip were responsible for a
sharp rise in American Steel and Wire, only
a traction of which was retained. Favorable
trade advices lent strength to international sil
ver. The feature of the dealings both here and
abroad was the large demand for New York.
Ontario and Western on the- expectation that
because of its new acquisitions in the coal
iuiiuÂ», the company woutu prolic by any im
provement in the anthracite trade. The stock
gained two points on transactions of almost
15,000 shares. In the general market the opin
ion was hesitating, but a pronounced tone soon
developed and prices ran off sharply on liquida
tion in the -specialties ana successful drives
against the grangers, Atchison preferred and
Northern Pacific. Renewed buying of Sugar
and like properties rallied the market, but the
bank statement fulfilled bear expectations,
â¢ showing another decrease in reserve of $4,000,
--000 and an increase in loans of nearly $13,000,
--000, and brought heavy realizing, particularly
â¢among the high-priced standard stocks. Toward
the close Sugar and Tobacco started upward
again, and the general market tailed on. Third
Avenue, which has been extremely conserva
tive in its movement until of late, assumed
a. commanding position among the erratic spe
cialties, rising to-day lH'- 2 points to 235. The
rise was attended by a reiteration of the vari
. ous reports concerning the property which as
" yet lacks authenticity. The market closed
firm with a general rise in progress.
The movement oi stock prices for the week
was extremely irregular, with losses prevail
ing among the s *TÂ«dard stocks, including
Northwest 1. Burlington 3, New York Central
2%, Pennsylvania 2 5 9 , and declines of 2% for
Southern Pacific and 2 for Central Pacific.
There was some very pronounced gains, how
ever, among the local stocks, Including Third
Avenue Railroad, 44 V 4; Consolidated Gas, 13%,
and Brooklyn Union Gas. 6. Among the in
dustrials the maximum gain was that of To
bacco, 35' i, while the preferred rose 7; Ameri
can Steel and Wire, 10%; the preferred 5, and
Sugar, 3%. The enhancement of these shares
conveys an idea of the part professional manip
ulation played In the week's market.
Other notable advances were New Jersey Cen
tral. 4Vi; Ontario and Western, 34, and Chi
cago Great Western. A, 5. Generally speak
ing, stocks were inclined to advance until Lon
don reverse-! her tactics and' purchased some
stocks on Thursday for the fortnightly settle
ment. But, as often happens, stocks were
freely supplied when there appears an inclina
tion to buy abroad, and although the mar
ket .was again opened up on Friday, the ten
dency .ii the general list continued downward.
The reverishness of dealings were suggestive
of a renewal of- professional control of the
market's operations. The enormous Increment
in paper values of "trust" stocks, including
some but recently launched, brought cautious
realizing elsewhere. Tobacco's exceptional
buoyancy was at first thought to be
merely a drive of obstinate shorts,
which may turn out to be the case,
but It is asserted with but feeble denials
that the company was to gain practical con
trol of the trade by a union with rival com
panies, the details being withheld. The con
tinued , demand for the finished Iron products
at advancing prices with many works run
ning at lull capacity served as a tonic to
the American Steel and Wire stocks, while the
Federal Steel stocks at one time sympathized
in the movement, but later lost their advance.
The punishment of the Tobacco shorts begot
apprehension among those having outstanding
short commitments in Sugar, resulting in hasty
covering. The persistent rumors that events
â were shaping themselves toward an arrange
ment for a uniform control of anthracite pro
duction had their effect on the mar
ket, and the price:, were reflected in the rise
of New Jersey Central and New York, On
tario and Western, liunington receded after
the announcement that the refunding plan
adopted was of much lesser scope than the
bulls had anticipated, and that the Issue of
more stock was contemplated. This sympa
thetically affected other railways. The con
tinued expansion of loans which have Increased !
over $51,000,000 in five weeks and the gradual i
Hecrease in the bank reserves, the former be
, Ing largely attributable to foreigners returning '
our securities, vas not altogether reassuring,
â while, on the other hand, the enormous in
crease in bank clearings reflected the activity
of general business in which, moreover, the
" failures were the smallest in years. A con
â  stantly large excess of exports over imports
and easy money as well as favorable wheat
' crop advices, even after the storm, were feat
ures of confidence. The sterling exchange
market was strong for several reasons, the re
turn from abroad of. American securities, a
. comparative scarcity of commercial bills and
. some discounting of the possible payment of
â¢ the indemnity to Spain. PÂ«n<llng a complete
. and satisfactory explanation of the words

pines 'in requesting the presence of a â  battle
â¢ ship, a sinister interpretation was put forward
by some speculative Interests, but generally
there was some disposition to be non-committal
until the circumstances were elucidated. The
dealings for the week were about I,ooo*ooo In
excess of last week. . -â â -.-.-.
The week's bond market, while somewhat ir
regular, showed a good undertone. Striking
, gains were made In many issues which here

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT. .',
NEW YORK, Feb. 25.â The Financier says: J
The bank statement for the week ending
February 25 Is remarkable In that it shows an â 
actual loss in cash, the first noted for some
weeks. The decrease Is small, but coupled
with the extra reserve requirements, necessi
tated by the expansion of nearly thirteen and
one-half millions in loans, the result has been
a decrease of four millions in surplus, bring
ing that item to thirty and one-third millions.
As the banks gained no cash, the Increase in
deposits amounting to $12,963,900 reflects bank
ing credits due to loan operations. Taken as a
whole the statement does not differ much from
what has been expected. The banks lost heav
ily last week to the interior and they were also
debtors to the Treasury. Conservative esti
mates had figured these losses -heavier than
shown by the statement, but the Increases in
loans and deposits, on the other hand, were
large enough to bring about predicted results.
The Increase In loans is to be attributed to
Stock Exchange requirements, and in a lesser
degree to the multitude of. Industrial combina
tions now being completed. A. detailed analy
sis of the statement shows that there has been
more or less shifting of funds Incident to spe
cial operations, but the loan can be- traced
to five or six of the largest banks. It Is note
worthy that an institution which reports
$G,000.000 additional loans shows a reduction
of $4,000,000 in specie. Incidents like these tend
to make elucidation difficult, as bo many fac
tors enter into the calculation that It Is al
most impossible to trace them." In a larger
sense, however, the exhibit makes for firm
ness In money, temporarily at least. It Is
quite likely that the statements of the paht
two weeks will be repeated in more or less
detail in the future, and that unless rates
harden perceptibly the excess reserve will not
.be increased. The extent of its reductions de
pends to a certain extent on the amount of
money which will be withdrawn from this cen
ter for interior needs on a continuance of pres
ent Stuck Exchange transactions.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Bran and .Middlings rule firm. Local Hay
continues dull and unchanged, though the feel
ing Is rather firmer. â  Outside Hay is higher.
The circular of Scott & Magner says: "Re
ceipts of Hay on the San Francisco market
during this week have" continued to-be quite
moderate, and not as much as is usual at this
period of the season. Jln . the absence of rain
and with the drying ' wind that is prevailing
throughout the State, it was â  natural to expect
that the market would advance, particularly
in view. of the fact that stocks of Hay on hand
are not large, but this expectation has' not
been realized. While the market is firm, and
on some consignments pales have been made
at slightly better figures than during last week,
there Is no . general advance ; in * prices. . Sales
during the week have only been fair: The -main
trouble appears to be the simple proposition of
lack â¢of demand. With a continuation of the
prevailing conditions, the market should do
better In rhe near future." - -> â ' .

anchors from the rock. A whale and its mate darted forward and
seized the anchors. The sharp anchor flukes caught in their throats
â¢and held them together. They could not swim apart. "Whenever they
tried to part company the pain forced them to stop. They were har

The harnessed whales did as they had been commanded.

that was drifting: by. -Bring me that spar."
Again the whales obeyed, carrying the spar in their mouths. The
â spar had a long rope fastened to it. This rope Egbert tied to the
chain. Then he sat astride of the spar and ordered the whales to

Sticking the ftoint of his sword in the spar, Egbert managed to steady
himself by holding on to the sword.

w.hales part company. The monsters managed soon to get nd of
the anchors and were glad that they had not fared worse.

FRANKIE will never forget the

around him, began to sing.
The monsters of the sea drew
near to listen. "Why do you
sing?" asked the whale. "Be

the Lady of the Black Robe

crowded nearer. "Do you not

ready to go home yetâ not while there
was a chance of another ride with Pat
on the cart.
"Pat." The voice was small and
faint.
"Pat." The voice was louder this
time and Pat looked around.
â¢Hello, toddlekins," said Pat cheer
ily, calling Frankie by his pet name.
"sure, and what do you want now?"

"Sure, then, and you are a bad boy

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBKUARY 26, 1899.
"All except one, master."
"Take then that or.c course you have never taken before."
The captain trembled, for he had heard strange stories about a
land that lay upon the shores of a bay entered orfly by a passage so
winding that no vessel was ever known to have come out after passing
in between the cliffs that, piercing the sky, guarded it on either side;
but he dared not disobey Egbert, the King's son.
When they had drawn near the cliffs Egbert entered a small boat
and, bidding the seamen good-by, rowed alone with strong strokes
through the winding passage to the bay. Hidden rocks wrecked his
boat and left him at the foot of a cliff, alone. Finding a trail he went
on â on and upward.
"Halt! Who goes there?"
Hardly had these words been spoken by one of Atrid's sons when
Egbert found himself battling for his life with a black dwarf.
They were at a dizzy height above the sea and the trail was
narrow "and steep. One misstep and Egbert would be hurled down to
destruction. The black dwarf was armed with a club. He was no
match for Egbert, who, after a hard battle, struck him down with his
sword. Not a moment was to spare. The sound of the conflict had
aroused other black dwarfs, who started down the trail from the
very top of the cliff to find out what the trouble was.
Egbert tore the black dwarf's clothes off. put them on his own
person and, seizing the dead black dwarf, hurled the body from the
precipice. Not looking back, when he heard the shouts of the other
black dwarfs, Egbert went on, not knowing where, but trusting to
chance to make his face look like the face of one of the sons of Atrid
and wondering how he would learn the language and arts of these
magicians.
Fortune favored him. There stands a great bronze mirror at
the foot of the cliff that catches and holds the pictures of the sons of
Atrid, but mirrors no other face. Egbert's memory was good. Re
calling the face of the dwarf with whom he had fought, he picked
out the dwarf's picture in the mirror and soon blackened his own
face and hands and made himself look just like the dwarf.
"THE THREE KINGS COME!"
Egbert stood back, hearing this said, and waited to see. Three
beautiful white women, acting as beasts of burden, carried the Three
Kings on their backs. Behind them were black dwarfs, goading on
the women with scorpion whips. Egbert was so enraged at the sight
that he nearly forgot his disguise and would have rushed forward to
rescue the women, who sobbed all the time, and walked feebly, being
if you do not give me a ride. I won't
love you enny more."
Pat could not stand this appeal. He
even let Frankie help put the coal in
and then took Frank up on the seat and
away the two friends went together on
the cart. Frank chattering like a mag
pie all the way. When they were op
posite Frankie's home Pat said "whoa"
and the horse came to a standstill.
"Don't stop now, Pat." pleaded
Frankie, "I have not had half enough
riding yet. Take me with you and I
will get home in time to go vith
mamma. She won't care if I am gone
a little longer."
â¢frlong!" The horse jogged on again
and Frankie was the happiest of all
boys- Pat even let Frankie drive some
of the way, where the horse was going
up hill, and then Frankie was th<>
proudest as well as the happiest of
boys. All rides will come to an end.
The place where the coal was to be left
lITiC ADy orTHE lIMIV jODCTJ
was reached. Pat tied the horse to a
post and went in to ask some aues
tion at the family in the house. He
left Frankie sitting in the cart. Who
should come along then but Frankie's
uncle Jack. The little boy was afraid
that Uncle Jack would pee him. so he
climbed from the seat over in among
the coal.
"Frankie." It was the voice of Pat
calling.
Frankie did not dare tÂ» answer for
fear that Uncle Jack would hear him.
Pat looked troubled when Frankie
did not appear, but thought that his
little friend must have run away again
and have gone home. The boy was not
on the seat. He was. in fuct. lying:
down in the dirty coal, to keep out of
the range of Uncle Jack's eyes.
What was that? Had an earthouake
taken place? Had the bottom fallen
out of the cart? Frankie was falline.

finish their breakfast because they are
hungry."
"Well, I want to catch 'em, and, say.
Rex, don't you think we could catch
them in a pail." .
"I think so if you think so, Kate."
"With that they dropped the fish-poles
and through the barn yard, across the
road, into the hmise they rushed, with
flushed and eager faces.
"Mamma, mamma." they called,
"please may we have a pail to fish
with. Fish won't bite pins, and just eat
up our nice long worms."
"Why. how in the world can you fish
with pails?" asked mamma.
"Why," said Kate, "that is easy. You
just put some worms in the pail and
hold the pail under the water and the
fish will go in."
"I don't see that," replied mamma,
"but you may have the pails."
Armed with two bright new tin palls
they returned to the creek and plunged
the pails into the water. The fright
bent over by the monsters on their backs. Luckily, the crooked sword
that he had taken from the black dwarf accidentally touched his hand
and reminded him.
'THE QUEEN ATOLL. IS HERE!"
Egbert now saw what angered him even more. For the wicked
Atoll rode in a heavy chariot of bronze, drawn by little girls and
boys, who were also sobbing-. To his horror Egbert saw these to be
children of the nobles of his father's court. Beside Atoll in the
chariot, fawning upon her, was an immense linn, which was her
bodyguard. The lion sniffed the air and|growled as the chariot passed
Egbert's place of hiding. Atoll laughed savagely.
â¢Hungry, are you? You will be fed soon if there are new cap
tives."
Egbert breathed easier when Atoll had passed.
"I am lost, and that speedily, " he said, 'unless I learn some of
the secrets of the magicians." How was he to get this knowledge?
To the Palace of Kahtola with speed! Kahtola was he who. in
the shape of a crocodile, had torn the magic robe from the shoulders
of the Lady of the Black Robe. Egbert joined the cYowd of black
dwarfs and ran with them. They entered the Palace and made their
way to the Throne Room. Each ran to his place. Egbert, by rare
good luck, picked out the place of the black dwarf whom he had
fought. He drew his crooked sword as he saw the black dwarfs do.
"Kah-lah-jah!"
This was the cry set up by the guards as Queen Atoll crossed the
threshold. Egbert joined with the others. This was the Queen's
welcome.
â¢'Bring in the captives!" commanded Atoll when she was seated.
'First bring the Lady of the Black Robe."
So the Lady had not escaped. She was in the power of Atoll
ard the Three Kings! At that instant the Three Kings entered and
with them came all .the other sons of Atrid with a great noise of
trumpets and shouting.
"I am here." so spoke a low and musical voice. "The Lady or
the Black Robe stands before you!"
Once more Egbert gazed upon her. He was sure by her steady
gaze at him that she knew him not to be a son ofAtrid, but he could
give her no sign.
"You will be my bride!" commanded each of the Kings.
"Not yours, but mine," said Kahtola. "Mme â I command!"
"Never." said the other Kings, as they laid hands on the hilts of
their crooked swords.
cart was sliding all around him. Down
he went into darkness and his voice
vas speedily heard, as, frightened and
somewhat hurt, he called aloud, "Pat,
oh, Pat; what are you doing to me?"
Then Pat was scared badly. He knew
Frankie's voice. He made a hasty
search and found Frankie in the coal
cellar, the worse for his accident. His
hands and face and hie white (?) dress
were grimy. From two little blue eyes
tears were running freely adown two
very grimy cheeks, and Frankies wail
ing was so loud that all the family
came out from the house to look. So
did the lady who kept a candy store
opposite, and every little child in the
Mock. They were all astonished.
Uncle Jack came running up. He
also knew Frankie's voice. "My Door
little boy!" was all that he said. Uncle
Jack was always kind. All he did to
Frankie now was to give him a piece of
candy.
How did Frankie look? You will
have to look at the pictures and then
you will see just what happened to a
bad, runaway little boy. No picture
would show how Frankie's mother
looked when she saw him come in with
Uncle Jack.
ened minnows took refuge under rocks
and among the rushes that grew in the
edge of the water.
"Pshaw," remarked Rex, "they are
afraid."
"Now, you just be still; I'll catch
'em," and Kate leaned out over the
bank very far indeed and kept very
quiet for a few minutes, when one wee
fish ventured over the edge of the pail.
"You've got him, you've got him,"
screamed Rex. and with that the fish
P.ed.
"There now, didn't I tell you to keep
still? You â you bad boy," cried Kate,
shaking with anger and excitement.
'Now I know he won't come back.
Oh! Oh!" and then tears began to flow
down wee Rex's face.
"Never mind, brother; I guess he'll
ccme again," said Kate. "I'll try
again. Now, you just put your fist in
your mouth."
Rex put his hand in his mouth obedi
ently, and Kate took a small stone and
held It in her teeth.
"In an instant the Throne Room resounded to the clash of swords.
The Three Kings foiryht and the black dwarfs warred in favor ot
their favorite Kings. Above the din of fighting rang out the voice ot
Queen AtoU.
"A mighty magician has made this war. See, Kahtola falls'. Who
shall reign in his place? He who can light the fire in the urn of
Ganis! Hold, cease fighting. I command!"
The words of the Queen were all powerful. The black dwarfs
sheathed their swords, but many dwarfs had fallen to rise no more.
"Here," whispered the Lady of the Black Robe to Egbert, as he
drew near to her without being noticed in the confusion, "take this
ring. With it you shall win the victory. Put it on the hilt of your
sword!" l
"Bring in the magic urn of Ganis, " commanded Atoll.
Four black dwarfs staggered under their load as they brought in
a huge urn, which they placed beside the throne upon which Atoll sat.
"Let the contest begin."
The Queen's lion stood beside the urn to battle with every dwarf
who should dare to come near. For the first time the lion even
threatened Atoll, who was troubled because she knew that some
magician stronger than herself had brought this about.
Each dwarf who wanted to be a King had to try to light the oil
in the urn with a torch. Five dwarfs, battling with the lion, were
beaten back. No other dwarf wished to make the test.
"Alas!" said AtoHI. "there is none among the one thousand sons
of Atrid who can take the place of Kahtola!"
"Stand back!" shouted Egbert, "here is one who will light the
magic urn."
Fearlessly he strode forward. His eyes already shone with the
light of expected victory. Forward leaped Atoll's lion eagerly to meet
him half way. They met just beside the urn. Profiting by the fall
of the dwarfs. Egbert did not wait for the lion to attack him, but
rushed furiously on, having the magic ring on the hilt of his sword.
With the speed of a flash and with great force the sword struck the
lion on one forepaw. cutting it off.
Backward Egbert leaped and waited for the lion to come. The
beast was furious now. Egbert just escaped the lion as it leaped at
him. One more blow and he had struck off the lion's head.
Down fell the lion. Atoll, pale with anger, ran to the beast, but
all her magic could not save its life.
"See," shouted the black dwarfs, "he lights the urn.'
It was even so. Egbert had the torch. With it he lighted the oil
in the magic urn. A strange smell filled the room.
"He is a false son of Atrid," cried Atoll, for the smell of the flame
was not of Ghat. "There is some mystery here. Ho, guards', seize
this person!"
But no one moved to touch Egbert.
"Give me the King's Black Robe," he commanded.
This was done.
â¢ Behold!" said Egbert. "I am the King Kahtola!'
"Long live King Kahtola !" shouted the dwarfs.
"Put Atoll in chains and lock her up In a dungeon, ordered
Egbert. "She has brought trouble upon up."
Egbert sat on the throne and Atoll was carried away in chains.
â Send these children to their homes."
By magic the children who had drawn Atoll's chariot were at
home with their rejoicing parents in a second of time.
Where was the Lady of the Black Robe? The defeat and im
prisonment of Atoll had given back much of magic to the Lady. She
has left Egbert to do the best that he can â alone with the hundred*
of magiciansâ relying on his own skill and courage. Her mission was
to assist the other Princes.
"So," said Egbert, when he was alone, "so I am a King of the
Magicians." D. H. "v* .

She tried again, holding her tongue in

She held the pail many minutes before

much frightened. In the meantime
Kate had scrambled out. very wet, but

her, all in the same breath, for giving
her such a scare, and sent Kate to bed
until her clothes got dry, as a punish

that if Rex had kept his hand in his
mouth, as she told him to, mamma
needn't have been frightened.
He trudges along behind the plow.
Dreaming of a golden crop,
Of tall oats rippling in the breeze,
And barns full to the top.
He ends his work at even tide.
When the sun sinks to its rest;
He wanders home with an easy heart.
For he feels he has done his best.

behold: the fashions change and spring blooms forth fresh and new!
we now open up what promises to be* the largest season we ever had: we've reached our arms across the continent, across the Atlantic, and bought
better goods than ever; bought in huge quantities for Hale's seven California stores; bought it and landed it here . in such quantities that we can

We've bought a greater variety to sell to you for cash. That's one thing about Hale's â it's a one-

_43___i -^nOr^THp cerned. It's the people's store. The man with overalls and the man of wealth all get the same
-_jjgfe_ |Â»^ goods at the same price. Cash levels all, both great and small. The poor but honest woman
/&MppPMp . never stands at our counters and sees the credit customer buying and hears her say "Charge it.

Women Who Steal Bargains.
Troubles of a Big Store Detective Whose Duty It Is to Watch the Tricky BargaiQ-Couoter Pilferers.
I THINK, after long experience, that
there are as few real store thieves
here in San Francisco as there are
in any city of its size in the country.
As for professional shopliftersâ l do
not believe that there have been
altogether more than five or six in
the city during the past five years.
The infrequent woman who comes
in here with secret pockets ex
! tending the length of her dress skirt.
; a golf cape with slits in the lining which
I make the ample garment a most conven
! lent receptacle for such goods as may
I strike the wearer's fancy, or a hand
! satchel with cunningly contrived oom
i partments which hold much and betray
: nothing to the ordinary observer, is
I quickly detected and easily disposed of.
There is something about her look and
manner which betrays her almost from
the moment that she crosses the thresh
i old; it is the amateur thiefâ one who has
none of the ear-marks of the profession,
but has an outward cloak of respectabili
ty to cover his or her peccadillos, whom
we detectives really dread, and who do
the most mischief in stores like this.
We find these people in every walk of
1 life, from abject poverty to actual w< alth,
j and, queerly enough it isâ if you will be
' lieve themâ always our fortune to catch
j them the very first time that they depart
I from the path of rectitude. Of all the
â  thieves caught in the act of stealing from
! the establishment there has not been one
who did not declare with tears that never
before had he or she been guilty of the
slightest act of dishonesty.
The fact that we arrest so few men in
comparison to women and girls of whom
â  we are compelled to make examples is
j due, not to the superior honesty of men,
'; but to the fact that in a store like this
1 women customers are in an overwhelming
majority. We have very little if any trou
: ble'with little girls, while boys of varying
i ages "sneak " small articles quite fre
quently. We deal with this class of cul
prits in a special way, however. We do
j not think it right to expose young boys
to the ' ontaminating influences of the
City Prison, or to cloud their lives with
the' disgrace of arrest, but when we llnd
them taking trifles without going through
the formality of paying for them, we just
! march them down cellar and argue with
I them concerning the wrongfulness of the
j proceeding by means of a stout little rat
i tan. Our arguments have always proved
' effective, for no boy repeats the experi
ment here after the first trial; and more
over, no indignant parent ever puts in an
appearance and disputes our right to take
i the law into our own hands in this infor
-1 ma! fashion.
Few people realize the difficulties sur
-1 rounding such . a position rs Mr. Allen
1 and I occupy. While we are expected to
I "let no guilty man" or woman "escape"
I we must err, if we err at all, always on
j the side of the public. An unfounded
I accusation, a mere suspicious interroga
i tion addressed to the wrong person, even
j the slightest hint of watchfulness in re-
J gard to one who can prove that he or she
i Is as Caegar's wife was obliged to be.
will ruin a store detective's reputation
and place the house for which he works
in a most unpleasant position.
I make it a rule never to arrest a
person whom I have not myself seen com
mit a crime. When a clerk sends for me
and tells me that a certain customer has
taken something from the counter I slm
., Ply watch the customer. As a general
Hales.
thing a person who takes a thing from
one department without apparent detec
tion cannot resist trying it again in an
other place. 1 "camp on th# trail" and
nine times out of ten I see them pick up
something they haven't bargained for and
start to walk "off. Then 1 interrupt them
and ask them to accompany me to the
office. Generally the worst kind of a
Bcene follows in there, but when 1 know
that I am right the outcome is assur; a.
The patrol wagon is sent for and the Po
lice Court takes the settlement off our
hands.
I believe we have compromised just two
cases since this store started, but there
were circumstances surrounding both
which made such a course excusable.
One was in the early days when
the departments were run by dif
! ferent firms. A very well dressed woman
I with a nice motherly face came in and
went downstairs to the vegetable stand.
and while the attendant was busy with
another customer she just stuffed her
sealskin cloak with his stock in trade and
came upstairs. She managed to iind a
newspaper somewhere and unloaded her
booty into it. making a huge bundle that
she could hardly carry, and then walked
around up in the house furnishing depart
-1 ment as coolly as possible, looking at
things, thinking that she had made the
'!Â« al all right. The vegetable man had
seen her pick up the things, however, and
! he got me to go with him and ask her
I about it. She saw us coming and threw
ilie bundle on a pile of comforters, and
I then went into a tearing rage. But after
a bit ?he calmed down and asked what
1 the damage was. There were two pota
toes, tour tomatoes, three apples, a head
of lettuce, two oranges and throe or four
liniidfuls of dried peas in that bundle,
and she paid the man $2 '*) tor the out
lit. And she had a poeketbook just packed
with twenty-dollar gold pieces to pay it
out of.
The other case was that of a pretty and
I retined looking young lady wiio came in
here with her little baby. She left it in
its carriage and went to different coun
ters, and tii, ally deliberately stole some
; cheap little articles, putting them in her
i pocket right before my eys. When we.
: took her in the office she refused to tell
her name, and did so only when we
threatened to send her off in the patrol
wagon at once. Then she wrote it on a
bit of paper and we found that she was
the wife of a very prominent lawyer. We
sent for him. and the scene there was
; svhen he found his wife there under those
clrcuxastances was the worst thing 0. the
! kind that 1 ever went through. At hrsi
I he wouldn't believe it possible that she
! had done such a thing, but she broke
down and confessed, and there thi
with the baby between them crying as
1 though their "hearts would break. Tin
end of it was that we let them out the
i back way and agreed to say nothing more
; about it: but we added her name to our
list of "undesirables'*â persons who have
been warned never to visit tne establish
j mentâ and she has never come inside our
! doors since.
There are two pretty young girls here
in town who got themselves into a queer
i fix by their love for finery. They plotted
I the whole thing togfether, it seems, and
; started out with a big satchel which
I they proceeded to fill at the expense of
â  this store. Feather boas, which seem to
j have a specially irresistible attraction for
! women thieves, ribbons, neckwear, belts
and toilet articles all went in there, and
j in consequence they went up before Judge
I Mogan. They were proven guilty and
i confessed, but the Judge has never sen
-1 tenced them. Instead he insists upon
their appearing before him every two
weeks, when he makes inquiries as to
their behavior and surroundings, gives
them a good, sharp lecture and lets them
Igo for another half-month. They were
arrested last October and have been
"coming up for sentence" ever since, and
the effect has been most salutary upon
them.
A handsome white-haired old lady,
dressed in most elegant style and with
plenty of money In her silver mounted
purse, hovered around the bijou counter
one day and annexed a dozen or so sil
Hales.
ver stamp and match boxes. We saw her
gather them in. and I asked her to take
a walk to the office with me. She under
stood what 1 meant and was furiously in
dignant, doing the "How dare you" act
to perfection, but as we walked along she
dropped the little boxes one by one, and
Mr. Allen, walking just behind, picked
them up; the two or three she hal remani
ng when we got to the office she threw
behind the gas stove, and then she defied
us. She w.ts SO stately in her manners and
s.i eieÃanl and refined in her appearance
that she almost made me believe thot my
eyes had played me false, but when the
patrol wagon arrived there was a com
plete transformation. Such language as
she used when she found that her bluff
wouldn't work i never heard from mor
tal woman, and I have heard some pretty
strong talk during the seven years that I
have spent as a detective. It took two po
licemen and the rest of us together to
get her started on her journey uptown,
and her fellow travelers didn't enjoy the
trip at all.
It was a younger womna who coolly
wenl upstairs, selected a papier mache
washbowl and pitcher and a suit of boy's
clothes and took them to the wrapper to
be wrapped up. The informality of the
proceedings struck the young man as be
ing worthy of note, and he asked her
what clerk sold them to her with th" re
sult that she confessed after a little sharp
questioning that she had simply accumu
lated them on general principles. Some
what similar to this was the escapade of
the young actress who went into the mil
inery department and picked out a hand
some hat and then hunted about until she
found a bandbox, in which she concealed
her prize and went off with it Into the
cloak room, where she was trying on
jackets, when we apprehended her. We
discerned by her confession that she had
visited us on two previous occasions, on
one of which she had stolen a dress and
on the other a waist.
Wr have caught only five Chinese
thieves here, all men. but there was no
nonsense in their selection of goods to
conceal in their long sleeves. They took
only such things as were valuable and
easily hidden, and they took them so
deftly that you could hardly believe it
even if you were looking straight at them.
Of course, besides watching the custom
ers we keep an eye on the clerks, for
where there are so many employed as
there are here, the number varying from
1200 to 2200 in the busy times, there may
be an occasional black sheep among them.
It is a rare thine, however, that we find
any of them dishonest, the worst thing
in "that line being the recent case of the
shipping clerk in the grocery department,
who, after having his salary raised twice
during the p.ist year and lxissc-ssing the
implicit confidence of his employers, could
not resist the temptation to till his pock
et? with small articles at the close of the
day's work. We emight him with a bot
tle" of orange marmalade, a can of boned
chicken and a piece of common brown
bar soap, and the result was that he was
sent up for ninety days as a punishment
and an example.
