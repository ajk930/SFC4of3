HI >NGKONG, April 15.â
Fighting has occurred
over the Britisli lease in
the Kowloon territory, opp
Hongkong. A small force which
was making preparations tor to
morrow's celebration of hoisting
a flag was attacked on Friday.
The ( >ne Hundredth Regi
ment was dispatched on Satur
day, which co-operated with the
torpedo-boat destroyer Fame,
marched overland and encoun
tered a force ni a thousand ('hi
nese soldiers in a strong posi
tion defended by artillery.
The Chinese lire was returned
and the Indians charged, carry
ing the position, the Fame cover
ing the advance. The Chinese
loss was small, but the British
was nothing. As it is evident the
Chinese were guilty of duplicity,
the ceremony was abandoned.
neral Gascoigne with a force
of Welch Fusiliers has gone
with a gunboat to hoist the flag
ay. Another force of In- I
dians is marching overland to its
support and to drive the Chinese j
forces outside the leased terri
tory.

SEATTLE. April 15.â Colvlllfi. in this
Btate, is excited over a sensational case
of drophobfa, of which Miss Nettie
Fogg is the victim. She is the owner of a
pretty water spaniel. While she was
feeding it a few days ago the animal bit
her. From that time Miss Fogg became
convinced that she would be seized by
hydrophobia. To-day froth came from
her mouth, she barked like a dog, and it
required the full strength of four men to
hold her. It Is not believed she will re

SACRAMENTO GAYLY GARBED FOR THE
CONCLAVE OF KNIGHTS TEMPLAR
SACRAMENTO, April 15.â Masonic
Hnll is resplendent to-night in its
Templar decorations of white and
black, intermingled with the Stars
and Stripes. It furnishes a pat
tern for the other important buildings
of the city, all of which will, within the
next couple of days, be similarly be
decked in honor of the approaching
conclave.
On Thursday. Friday and Saturday
of next week Sacramento will entertain
the Grand Commandery of California,
Knights Templar, and the department
conclave. The indications are all fa
vorable for a large gathering of
Knights, many of whom will bring their
wives and daughters.
While the programme as arranged by
the local rommandery of Knights,
whirh will art as host, is to a large ex-
tent made up of secret work of the or
der, there wHI he many features of in
terest to the puhlic. Not the least of
thf^'- will be a parade in which over
40n Knights will be in line and a drill
at the new pavilion.
Eminent Commander E. W. Hale of
Sacramento Commandery, who has
charge of the arrangements for the en

has paid close attention to detail and
the three days of the session will pass
most pleasantly and profitably to the

BRUSSELS, April IB.â Edward An

rived here to-day. When he was
asked in an interview when the Philip
pine insurrection would end, he replied:
Only when Aguinaldo and some c.
his followers, who fight under com
pulsion, know specifically the exact
form of government that the United
States intends for them, and when
the United States has paid them some
compensation for their successful
fight against the Spaniards.
"Let the insurgents know in definite
words the intention of thr- Americana
to grant them local government; let the
T'nlted States also comyvnsate them
for their military service against Spain

SPEAKER REED
WILL RETIRE
FROM CONGRESS
Special iMepatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 15,â A special to
the Mail and Express from Washing
ton says: Speaker Reed has a sur
prise in store for the country. He will
soon sail for Europe, intending to spend
pome time abroad. Before he starts it
is expected that he will announce his
decision to retire from Congress ami
take up the practice of law in New
York. Mr. Reed spent several days in
Washington last week, going north at
the beginning of this week, and before
he left he arranged matters so that he
would not be obliged to come back for
any length of time. He has been reti
cent in regard to his plans, but has
taken into his confidence a number of
his friends at the capital.
Several members' of the New York
delegation, who know of Mr. Reed's in
tention, have already planned to start
a boom for a New York member for
Speaker. Rumors that Mr. Reed was
to retire from have been so
numerous recently that when his de
termination became known it was at
first thought to be merely a revival of
the old story. This time, however, con
firmation has come from Mr. Reed him
self, and while it is not his intention
to have his plans made public before
his departure for Europe, the app^ar
ancÂ° of so many members of the New
York delegation in Washington within
the last few days has given publicity to
the fact.
Mr. Reed will become attorney for
several large insurance companies, and
as hp Bays himself, he is a poor man,
and thinks it time that he should make
some money, which he cannot do if ho
remains in Congress.

Fseclal Dispatch to The Tall.
LONDON. April 15.â Whatever be the
reason the Queen, is to return to Eng
land from Cimiez earlier than was at
first intended when her Majesty vent
away. It Is true that sh>- is anxious
to celebrate her 'eightieth birthday at
home, but the date for her return to
Windsor is fixed definitely for the 'jSth
of the present month, four weeks ahead
of her birthday. Truth, which usually
is well Informed In matters pertaining
to royalty, hints {hat the French Gov
ernment will be much relieved when
the Queen leaves Cimiez, for they had
a deal of trouble and have had to take
most stringent measures and precau
tions to prevent the Queen from being
molested in any way when out driv
ing, and guarding and shadowing have
been redoubled since the affray which
occurred between the sailors from the
Osborne and a party of French ma
rines when the royal yacht was at Ville
Franche with the Princess of Wales.
Anyhow, all is bustle at Windsor for
the celebration of her Majesty's pro
gramme, for the day begins with a spe
cial Bervlce in the morning in the
mausoleum at Frogmore, where the
body of the Prince Consort lies en
tombed. In the. evening there will be a
great state banquet in St. George's Hall
in the castle, followed by a perform
anee of "Lohengrin" by the Covent
Garden Company in the celebrated
Waterloo room: Always thinking about
the people, the Queen is to celebrate
her eightieth birthday by a gracioua
act. The public have always had a
great desire to see the interior of the.
famous historic Kensington Palace. On

ROME, April 15.â 1 have had an in
terview with Cardinal Rampolli. He
described the Pope's health as flourish
ing, and said that the consistory would
be held shortly.
NEW YORK, April 15.â The Rome
correspondent of the Herald, writing
under date of April 9. says: The ques
tion of the consistory is much discussed
in ecclesiastical circles. There are at
present fourteen vacancies in the Sn
cred College, and this situation might
have an Influence on the election of the
future Pope. It is hoped that the con
sistory may be held in the month of
June, and that ten nr twelve cardinals
may be created. It is the Italian ele
ment that would be strengthened, for
so many foreign cardinals would not
have taken part in a conclave for sev
eral centuries. There are twenty-two
of them against only twenty-six Ital
ians. Not that there Is any fear of a
foreign Pope, but it is considered at
the Vatican that the Italians are too
much in the minority, and that the
matter must be seen to as quickly as
possible. As regards the future cardi
nals, three are already considered cre
ated, namely, Monsignors Clasce, Delia
Volpe and Francisco Nava. I hav^
heard the name of Pere Captier men
tioned as a future French cardinal, also
that of the Belgian Benedictine, Abbot
Hemptonne. This is what is to be gath
ered in conversation with those who
frequent the Papal court.

A FEAR THAT
DREW'S IS
ALREADY DEAD
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARTS, April 15.â Sinister rumors
are atloat arising from the publi
cation in Eclair of the official re
port of Governor Daniel, contain
ing the alleged statement by
Dreyfus that he contemplated suicide.
This is taken to be a preliminary an
nouncement to prepare the public for
the news that the victim is dead.
The statement of Governor Daniel
differs from Dreyfus' recont tolpprams
announcing he was in good health, and
is causing anxiety to his family.
Matthew Dreyfus, his brother, said
to-day: "He cannot be dead yet, but I
entertain small hopes."
In Eclairs story Governor Daniel at
Devils Island tells of the reception by
Dreyfus of the news of the revision of
his case. Dreyfus, it is said, had writ
ten to his wife that he wished to com
mit suicide. When asked to testify hf>
said he had nothing to sayâ that he did
not remember anything. He once said
to a physician who was attending him:
"They are afraid my family will be
tray tho famous incriminating letters;
they are afraid the Kaiser will get to
â know of it; but they are not afraid that
my Wife will take otir two children and
throw herself at the feet of the Emperor
and ask him for justice."
Dreyfus told Governor Daniel that he
had not anything to say to the Court
of Cassation. On November 24. 1898, he
wrote the Governor that when he wag
tried he asked M. Casimir-Perier, then
President of the French republic, for a
public trial, which M. Casimir-Perier
promised him, under conditions which
Dreyfus swore to observe; but the pub

AGRARIANS
Their Wrath Prematurely
Vented During Negotia
tions as to Samoa.
YON BULOW ASSAILED
"English Stubbornness" and"Yanket
Greed" Caused the Berlin Press to
Use Idiotic Pyrotechnics.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the AFFrwiated PreeÂ».
BERLIN, April 15.â The Samoan
question continued to over
shadow all others during the
week, so much so that the Inter
est in the subject has even seized
the masses. The most remarkable
feature of the affair is the united daily
onslaught made by the entire Agrarian
forces and part of the Conservative and
National Liberal press on the Cabinet,
lally on the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Baron yon Bulow, who is
charged with following a vacillating
policy and yielding too much to "Brit
ish Insolent c and Yankee impudence."
A regular campaign of abuse has been
opened against the leaders in foreign
politics, many of the latter utterances
being of unusual vigor. It is learned
on good authority that the most of this
is directed against Baron yon Bulow.
It is added that Friday's Interpella
tion of the Government in the Reichs
tag cm the Samoan question and Baron
yon Bulow's reply were intended as a
test of Btrength between the two con
tending parties, as Baron yon Bulow,
as well as the Cabinet, which is more
or less swayed by him, is considered
by the Agrarians to be distinctly hos
tile to their Interests. But the great
noise of the Agrarian press and its
allies might not to deceive people into
the belief that they represent public
opinion. They are merely the minority.
Neither the Emperor nor the Govern
ment has been influenced by these mis
chief-makers. This fact was strikingly
illustrated in the passing of the mid
land canal bill by the Diet. The meas
ure was extremely distasteful to the
Agrarians. t The party is distinctly on
the down-grave. In the Reichstag the
party fias onty about 168 out of a total
of 397 members and in the Diet its ad
herents number considerably less.
Dr. Lehr"s ridiculous jingoism in the
Reichstag last evening spoiled the
Agrarian game.
The German press comments on the
occurrences in Samoa this week dif
fered remarkably, owing to the party
standpoint of each paper. Until Fri
day, while the fate of the high com
mission was trembling: in the balance,
the comment was more vivid and more
bitter. The Deutsche Zeitung headed
a page editorial "The Shame of Sa
moa." and condemned the action of the
rnment. . It declared that the Cab
inet was wholly devoid of national
sentiment, and asked ironically: "What
more do we want. Thp Dreibund has
fallen to pierpp, Russia is allied with
France, England with the United
States. Austria is allied to France and
Italy Is dependent upon England, with
the possibility of going over to France;
added to all this, the brutal treatment
wo have been subjected to by England
and thf United States, by fount yon
Thun-Hohenstein (Austrian Premier),
Mr. Maxae (British Consul at Apia), .Mr.
Thambers (Justice of the Supreme
Court) and Admiral Kautz. Indeed, we
ask. what more do we want?"
One Agrarian organ spoke of the im
potent weakness shown in Samoa, and
concluded: "We stand aghast at the
tombstone of German honor."
Thi* more reasonable Conservative
press expressed itself most bitterly.
The Kreuz Zeltung said: "It seems
to be settled that we were too optimis
tic in judging from the declarations of
Mr. White that England and America
had not identified themselves in the
Samoan matter. This, indeed, seems to
be the case not alone in Samoa, but
generally in the White House and
Downing street."
From inquiries made among the lead
ing members of the Colonial party, the
correspondent, of the Associated Press*
ascertains that it is their belief that th^
United States wants the Samoan Isl
ands and is going to have them. A well
informed correspondent of the Yolks
Zeitung asserts this in an article, add
ing many details. The L,okal Anzeig^r
made under thÂ» head of "A Noble Pair
of Brothers" an expression of the opin
ion that the Anglo-American under
standing will not last long, "as mer
chants seem unscrupulous in competi
tion the English and Americans will
easily become enemies."
The Vossische Zeitung compares the
former cessions to the United States by
France, Spain and Russia with the
present movement in the British West
Indies and says: "All the countries
subsequently regretted their sales and
England has no need to yield valuable
possessions in the West Indies so long
as she. is not needing worthless terri
tories in Africa and Polynesia. Surely
Yankee greed at this, the first oppor
tunity, seems to demonstrate that thÂ»
British-American friendship will not be
of long duration."
A number of papers also point out
the absolute necessity of a larger navy.
The semi-offlrial Post in an inspired ar
ticle says: "Probably the Samoan dif
ficulties would not have arisen at all
if the other countries had to reckon
with a strong German fleet ready for
any emergency."
Many of the papers have emphasized
the fact that the absence of cable con
nection with Samoa was largely respon
sible for the most recent trouble. They
urge the laying of a cable as soon as
possible.
The Cologne Gazette points out tbit2
the system of unanimity is a feature
which the United Stales has previously
strongly insisted upon, in quoting Pres
ident Harrison in 1892 on this. The
papers also deduce that, even accept
ing the American Interpretation of tho
Treaty, Admiral Kautz has put hlmseif
in the wrong.
Th.- officiate of the Unite 1 States Em
bassy are well satisfied with Baron yon
Bulow's speech, which agreed with his
previous statements to the United
States Embamador, Mr. White, who
considers his speech to have been mod
erate and pacific, and he cabled Wash
ington s .
The correspondent of thÂ«Â» Associated
Press here hams that both the United
states and Great Britain expressed the
hope that the unanimity principle
would not be carried to an unreason
able extent, which might easily frus
trate the whole purpose ol the commis
sion and result in a deadlock it one
power stood out against the other on
every question.
The Government has appointed Coun-
Belor yon Knebet de Beritz of the Min
istry .if the interior and Baron Mar
shall yon Bleberstein commissioners to
proceed to America and Investigate the
methods of the New York Life Insur

BRITONS SORE OVER
SALISBURY'S BACKDOWN
Copyrighted, ISM, ty th< I Press,
LONDON, April 15. Germany has
drawn the first bl 1 In the Samoan
negotiations at the expense of Great
Britain in securing the Important point
of unanimity in th< decisions of the
commissi n against which the Marquis
ilisbury held out until Germany's
resistance forced him to knuckle under.
Ip to the last moment Inspired i I
emanating fn.ni the British Foreign
Office, declared Great Britain would
assent to unanimity. Only the
night an Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Baron yon Bulow,
made the announcement that (treat
Britain had agreed to unanimity, and
the Assi had an
nounced from Berlin th
d t" unanimity an in
spired note was circulated, asserting it
â¢ that the British Pre
mier and Fon Ign Minist r had
cepted the unanimity. Therefore, the
German Foreign Minister, at the same
time that In- annoum ed Great Britain's
accer: Imity, announced a
in diplomacy.
Baron yon Bulow and Couni yon
Hatz. nburg, the German Em
idor at London, can claim the
â¢ for this vi< tory. It was dv
their linn attitude and abl<
of th-
Baron vi â  rul in thÂ«,

that the United SI I not op

A\ mt the German
gn Minister's announcement that
t Britain had , - J caused
irritation here, which is refle< ted In the
â  his morn
ing. The Morning Post speaks caust
ically of Baron yon Bulow "s "misplaced
parade of firmness" in n to th>
maintenance of German rights, and
complains that he announced the a
ment as to unanimity "In the t<
a Minister who had achieved a great
and glorious diplomatic victory."
All the English papers wen
to unanimity. de< taring that the com
mission could never under such cir
cumstances come to an agreement.
The says: The rule of
unanimity on any point is hardly rea
sonable, but the rule of absolute unan-'
imity is unworkable."
The Spectator expresses the beli.ef
that "the rule of unanimity appeals to
be intended to reduce the commission
to a mere group of reporters."
The selection of C. N. F. Eliot of th'-
British Embassy at Washington to
represent Great Britain on the com
mission has given satisfaction.
The Speaker, referring t.. Mr. Eliot's
appointment, remarks: "A man who
has learned bo much apparently with
out effort ran be trusted to grasp th*
situation in Samoa rapidly and deal
with the persons concerned with mini
mum friction."

MAY SOON CALL FOR
ADDITIONAL VOLUNTEERS,
NEW YORK, April is.â The Herald's
"Washingon correspondent R.-nds the
following: President McKinley is being
very strongly urged to exercise the au
thority given him by the army reorgan
ization act to organize the provisional
army of 35,000 men to serve until July
1, 1901.
Most of the pressure for this in
creased military force comes from offi
cers of the present volunteer service
wh<> havf either been mustered out of
the serivce or are to be, and who wish
main. Many army officers also be
lieve it would be wise for the Presi
dent to raise all <>f thin furoe, or part of
It, so as to bo ' <i more men to
the Philippines without drawing too
heavily on the force in Cuba and" Porto
Rico, or reducing tho reserve in the
United States.
In discussing the matter with volun
teer officers and others, the President
hap said he would raise this force if it
should become necessary to do so, and
pome of his visitors have left the White
House with the Impression that it has
been determined to is^ue a call f<.-r
volunteers in the near future.
I was told at the War Department
this afternoon that there had been no
Furious consideration of a call and that
such action was not in contemplation.
.but should it become apparent that a
much larger force would be required
in the Pmllpplnea there is no doubt the
President will call for a part of the

INTERESTING TESTIMONY
GIVEN BY DETEC T IVES
PARIS, April 16.â The Figaro pub
lishes this (Sunday) morning the evi
dence given by Detectives Guenee.
Tomps and Desvenire before the Court
of Causation. Ouence deposed that Col
onel Sandherr, after Dreyfus was ar
rested, commissioned him to investi
gate his private life. Guenc.e reported
that Dreyfus was addicted to gambling
and association with women. He notn
bly frequented the house of a woman
named Bodson, where a scandal broke
out, a German officer threatening to
disclose Dreyfus' connection with Ger
many. The Bodson woman intervened
to prevent it.
Henry sent Gribelin to Guenee with
Dreyfus' photograph. Guenee ad
mitted he knew, but refused to reveal
the bearer of the bordereau to Matin.
He admitted the report he made conÂ»
rerning Dreyfus was based upon the
gossip of servants and others, but when
pressed to give names refused on the
ground of professional secrecy.
Tomps deposed that he was ordered
to discover the bearer of the bordereau
to Matin. When the evidence he ob
tained pointed to Teyessonviere, one of
the handwriting experts against Drey
fus. Henry dropped Tomps and em
ployed Gribelin to continue the investi
gation.
Desverniere deposed that Picquart
employed him to spy upon Esterhazy,
whom he saw four times at the Ger
man Embassy, otherwise his evidence
was unimportant.

BRIBES OFFERED
BY THE STANDARD
How Oil Trust Tried
"Square" Cases.
Erecial Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 15.âAttor
ney General Monneti liled in the office
Of the clerk of i!:" Supreme Court to
day the long-promised history in detail
of the alleged attempt of representa
tives of ih â â¢ Standard Oil Company to
have him withdraw the suit brought to
have the company adjudged guilty of
contempt of an order of 1892 declaring
it a trust. Mr. Monnett gives, some in
formation as to the attempts made to
influence former Attorney General
Watson, and then comes to attempts
made to corrupt him. He declines to
give the names of the alleged guilty
parties, but asks for an order of court
commanding him to produce the testi
mony.
He says men are known to him and
to D. K. Watson, his predecessor, but
these and details of the attempts are
held in such a way that it can only be
elicited by an investigation by the
court.
The opening pages of the statement
recite the cause of the litigation. He
then passes into specifications show
ing how repeated attempts have been
made to interfere with the department
of justice in this case:
1. In October, 1690. soon after the orig
i inal Standard Oil case was brought, a
: member of the Ohio Legislature (name
j not given), who has had great experience
I as a lobbyist, called on ex-Secretary of
j State D. J. Ryan at the Park Hotel and
: offered J75.000 if he would successfully use
his influence to have the case against the
Standard stopped.
2. A party known by name to D. X
Watson called him to the Gilsey House
I in New York and offered him the attor
i neyship for 3000 miles of railway for life
: if he would let the Standard Oil case run
! over his term.
3. Another man claiming to represent
the Standard called on Watson here in
Columbus and offered him $100,000 to drop
the case.
4. A second time a New York party
called Watson to New York; told him ho
was a fool not to accept the railroad at
torneyshin and renewed the offer with
$100,000 additional. The names of the
would-be bribers and full details are
known to D. K. Watson and can be se
cured only by the court ordering a full
investigation of the matter.
5. Thereafter another man claiming to
represent the Standard Oil Company
called on Watson and improperly tried to
induce him to drop the cases, but failed.
6. Dewitt C. Jones of Columbus, attor
ney-and cousin of D. K. Watson, was
called to New York and Cleveland to ne
gotiate for Watson to drop the Standard
Oil case in consideration of getting the
appointment of United States Minister to
China.
7. Then is presented the letter of Kline
& Elliott, attorneys for the Standard, In
which they demand of Monnett the
I the State. There â¢will be a baseball game â¢

the names of the bribers. He alludes ti

Monnett admits that he had long been an

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELESrApriI 15.-The fact

U s. G. Todd, the secretary of the s>n

just as certainly as the Democratic Na
tional Convention will convene.
"Barrett may personally opp#se Sen
ator White and pit ex-Governor Budd
against him as a party leader, but we
consider White the m<>st available man
to lead the delegation. This new De
mocracy", which aligns itself with the
masses against trusts, injunctions and
corporate power, is a factor that must
not be overlooked in th<=> running.
"That White got into the stream in
the meeting of the New Democracy
club last night is recognized to-day
and, although he said be would not ac

people, his adherents are insisting that
he Is the most powerful and prominent
Democrat in California at this time,
and the future will show that his
chances two years hence to be returned
to the United States Senate will not be
dimmed by any obstacle which may be
erected at this time."
Republican leaders are realizing that

BRYAN TALKS AT
NEW YORK'S DOLLAR
JEFFERSON DINNER
fill Sorts of People in the Big
Audience Applaud h|is Ideas on
Silver ar)d Imperialism.
NEW YORK, April 15.â The dollar Jef
ferson dinner of the Chicago platform
Democrats at the Grand Central Palace
to-night in point of numbers was one of
the biggest affairs ever held in this city.
Nearly 8000 men and women sat down at
long tables in the various rooms at the
big palace. There were all kinds of peo
ple them, dressed in all kinds of clothes.
White men elbowed with colored men and
white women with colored women. There
were four Japanese, and three Chinese
present, but the Chinese were merely
spectators and sat in the second gallery.
They said they had come to see Mr.
Bi van.
The main hall presented a different as
pect from that of the Metropolitan
Opera-house at the $10 dinner of the
Democratic Club. There were no floor
embellishments, but just great long av
enues of tables covered with plain v. bite
plates. The only ornaments were bunches
of celery and granite ware coiTee pots.
There was no concerted attempt to seal
th^ 3000 diners simultaneously. All were
told to go in and sit down. About 7
o'clock nearly every seat of the
men's table was occupied and the }
dinner began. Over 600 waiters
started out into the main hall with soup
ii few minutes before 7 o'clock. The
menu included soup, fish, roast beef,
turkey. Ice cream, coffee and cigars.
Three thousand bottles of wine were gra
tuitously served by a wine company.
At 9 o'clock the committee and speak
ers ascended the platform. Mr. Bryan
received a vociferous ovation, the diners
in many Instances standing on chairs and
tables and the women waving napkins
wildly. James R. Brown called the meet
ing to order and introduced George Fred
\\ llliams of Massachusetts, who was
given a fine reception.
The crowds in the galleries meantime
had increased, and there were at least
SOOO people in the hall. The mention of
Henry George's name evoked an extra
ordinary demonstration.
O. H. P. Belmont was next introduced,
and in the course of a brief speech said:

VON BULOW NOW
GUIDES GERMANY
Chancellor Hohenlohe
Only a Figurehead.
Copyrighted. 1899. by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, April 15.â With the reas
sembling of the Reichstag the imperial
Chancellor, Prince Hohenlohe, has re
turned from Baden-Baden, where he
spent a fortnight for his health. His
return is ironically greeted by the
Agrarian press as showing that he Is
a mere figurehead and that Baron Yon
Bulow continues to be the real head of
the Government.
The most important matter, aside
from the Samoan interpellation, was
the introduction in the Diet of the mid
land canal bill. The Agrarian opposi
tion to this most important Prussian
measure of the session has increased
in spite of the fact that the Emperor
has strongly identified himself with it.
The support it is receiving from indus
trial circles and the strong pressure ex
erted In the other quarters in behalf
of the measure makes it probable thai
the bill will become law.
In the negotiations for a reciprocity
treaty between Germany and the
; United States the former claims that
; under the mdst favored nation clause
i the United States must In any case
i grant the same concessions as recently
j granted to Switzerland and France.
| The United State? disputes this, con
! tending that the most favored nation
j clause does not apply to special con
| cessions actually made as In the case
of the French treaty. Regarding the
Swiss treaty It Is contended in behalf
: of the United States that it was con-
I eluded under a misapprehension upon
| the part of the American Government,
| and that It is probable the whole treaty
| will be denounced by the United States
j as inconsistent with all America's pre
i vious commercial treaties. There can
be no question of American feeling in
this respect. It is said that a reci-
p rocity treaty will be negotiated, Ger
: many granting equivalent concessions.
At the Kiel navy yard the Govern
ment has been experimenting with a
vessel fitted with a motor which is the
Invention of a Hungarian named Pe
triano. The advantages claimed f,, r the
I motor are the use of crude oil as fuel
and a reversible action, facilitating
I storing and allowing the vessel to be
â  driven ahead or astern. It is claimed
[ that the motor saves 50 per cent In
fuel, that it does not require frequent
! cleaning and that Herr Krupp offered
i a large sum for the world's patent up
on conditions which the inventor re
fused.
There Is much comment in diplo
i matic circles over the special favor
I shown by Emperor William this week

i giving a series of performances at one
i of the royal theaters with the St. Pc-

' His Majesty has presented splendid
gifts to the leading artists and has

Russian favor.
The Emperor has presented a gold
chain and set of Jewels worth 18,000

united States and spoke of those present
as being "true to the principles of Democ
racy as written in Democracy's latest
creed," a stutement which provoked
cries of "Bravo."
As compared with the action of the
Silver Republicans, Bryan held up the
course of the "National Democrats" and
said:
There can he no harmony between those
whose opinions are as antagonistic as the
opinions set forth in the Chicago platform and
the Indianapolis platform. All that we ask is
that those who come into the Democratic party j
shall be a part of the Democratic party. We
simply Insist that a man cannot be a political j
bigamist. He cannot be wedded to the name 'â 
of our j>arty and to the principles of some I
other party. We simply ask that he shall get !
a formal divorce, either from our name or from I
their principles.
Continuing. Bryan declared that the Chi
cago platform was written by the repre- |
sentatives of the Democratic party in j
the most Democratic convention that has '
been held in a quarter of a century, and j
that "every plank of it Is stronger to- j
day than it was when the platform was j
written."
Bryan discussed the question of bimet
allism at length, repeating well known
arguments, and said:
"I have been asked why I am not will
ing to drop the money question. I reply.
Because the money question won't drop
us.
1 know not what others may desire or what
they may be willing to do, but I am not wllllnjr
that mil- declaration against the gold standard
shall he dropped as long as a handful of Eng
lish unanclers can determine the financial
I'Ollcy of seventy million of American people.
And some say that If we will not drop the
money question we ouiht to drop the ratio of
It; to 1. When you find a man opposed to 16
to 1 Inquire and you will find that he was never
hi favor of It, and then Inquire again Rnd you
will fliul that there Ib no other ratio that he
if in favor of. We denounced International bl
nvtalism as a delusion and a snare in 1596.
It has hoen proved to be so since 1596. We de
lared for the ratio of 16 to 1 In IM6 and no
r.'irty has risen to advocate any other ratio
hut 16 to 1. L'ntll some other party proposes
some Other ratio and tries to secure bimetal
ism at some other ratio there Is no reason why
we should discuss ratio with them. The ratio
of 16 to 1 was decided upon, not at the Chicago
Convention, but at the primaries which elected
delegates to att.-nd the Chicago Convention.
The ratio of 16 to 1 has been submitted to the
â¢â¢, and those who wanted it in 1596 are in
favor of It now. And they know why they are
in favir of it. The ratio of 16 to 1 is the ratio
at which our cold and silver coins now circu
late. We simply nsk relnstallment of the law
that was on the statute books, where It was

j assed.
In conclusion Bryan declared against
the increase of the standing army, de
! nounclng it as an unnecessary burden
upon the people. He urged that the Porto
I Hicans should be given their choice be
tween annexation and a republic of their
own.
A reference to the United States as a
bully for striking down the Filipino na
tives created the greatest enthusiasm of
the night. There was a mighty demon
stration when he said that it was this

policy. This was received with wild ap
plause.

ADVERTISEMENTS. .
THEY RIDICULE IT.
Many People Ridicule the Idea of an
Absolute Cure for Dyspepsia
: And Stomach Troubles.
Ridicule, However, Is Not Argu-
ment, and Facts Are Stub-
born Things.
Stomach troubles are so common and In
most cases so obstinate to cure that peo-
ple are apt to look with suspicion on any
remedy claiming to be a radical, perma-
nent cure for dyspepsia and indigestion.
Many such pride themselves on their
acuteness in never being humbugged, es-
pecially In medicines.
This fear of being humbugged can be
carried too far; so far, in fact, that many
people suffer for years with weak diges-
tion rather than risk a little time and
money in faithfully testing the claims
made of a preparation so reliable and uni-
versally used as Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets.
Now, Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
vastly different In one important respect
from ordinary proprietary medicines for
the reason that they are not a secret pat-
ent patent medicine; no secret Is made
of their Ingredients, but analysis shows
them to contain the natural digestive
ferments, pure asceptic pepsin, the diges-
tive acids. Golden Seal, bismuth, hydras-
tls and nux. They are. not cathartic,
neither do they act powerfully on any
organ, but they cure Indigestion on the
common-sense plan of digesting the food
eaten thoroughly before it has time to
ferment, sour and cause the mischief.
This is the only secret of their success.
Cathartic pills never have and never
can cure indigestion and stomach troub-
les because they act entirely on the bow-
els, whereas the whole trouble is really
in the stomach.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets taken after
meal* "digest the food. That Is all there
Is to it. Food not digested or half digest-
ed is poison as it creates gas, acidity,
headaches, palpitation of the heart, loss
of flesh ana appetite and many other
troubles which are often called by some
other name.

RAILWAY WAR ON
AT BAKERSFIELD
Valley Road Versus the
Southern Pacific.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, April 15.â Merry war
is on between the Southern Pacific and the
Valley road. It arose over the excursion
to Fresno, where the Bakersfield and Rai
sin City men will play baseball to-mor
row. When the excursion first was
broached its promoters went to the
Southern Pacific to arrange for a reduced
rate. They were told it would be a fare
and a half, or $4 20. The Valley road of
ficials were then seen. They made a rate
of one fare, $3. Then the Southern Pacific,
made a rate of $2 50, with the understand^
ing that passengers must go on regular
trains. The Valley road chopped to $2 50
and agreed to supply a special train and
send Agent Kane along to extend all the
courtesies to the excursionists.
This made the Southern Pacific people
mad. They declared the Valley road vio
lated the ethics of railroading. They
then made a rate of $1 90 and hung a blaz
ing banner across the street on which
was inscribed:
"Grand Fresno Excursionâ Baseball â
Bakersfleld Athletics vs. FresnoâPosi
tively lowest rates Southern Pacific Com
pany, Sunday, April 16. Choice of trains;
ample equipment."
An attempt was made to swing the ban
ner across the street from the Southern
Hotel, but before this was done Valley
road influence caused it to come down.
Then they made an attempt to swing it
from the Arlington Hotel. The same In
fluence prohibited it from going up there.
Finally the banner was moved down on
Nineteenth street and swung from the
City Hall to a vacant house. There it
flutters to-night.
Circulars of each company flew about
the streets all day. setting forth the of
fers of the rival lines. Crowds of men
gathered here and there and talked ex
citedly. When it was announced the
Valley road would have a brass band go
along, back came the word that the
Southern Pacific would do likewise. The
people are with the Valley road, notwith
standing the Southern Pacific's lower
rate, and many declare they would pay
full fare rather than go by the Southern
Pacific. A large crowd will make the trip.
Late this afternoon it was reported that
the Southern Pacific agent offered to sell
seventy-five tickets for $1 25 each. The
people say the Valley road made a cheap
excursion possible, and now they will not
go back on the new company.

IN THE HANDS
OF A RECEIVER
Puget Sound Dredging
Company Tied Up.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, April 15.â The Puget Sound
Dredging Company, a Seattle corporation,
in which both the Pacific Coast Company
and the San Francisco Bridge Company
are largely interested, was thrown into
the hands of a temporary receiver
in the Superior Court here to-day,
the culmination of a disagreement
between the majority and the minority
stockholders. The latter, who are the Pa
cific Coast Company, and Robert Moran,
the ship-builder, are the plaintiffs in the
suit. They allege that the majority
stockholders, the San Francisco Bridge
faction, are attempting by fraud to ob
tain complete control of the dredging
company and make away with its assets.
The suit, it is said, signalizes the com
mencement of a long legal battle be
tween two great corporations for the con
trol of a third. The defendants are the
dredging company itself, the bridge com
pany, J. B. C. Lookwood, M. B. Lock
wood and William N. Concannon.
The Lockwoods are large stockholders
in the dredging company. Concannon is
made a defendant on the ground that he
has purchased certain of the assets of the
dredging company in pursuance of reso
lutions passed by a meeting of the board
of trustees, in which the minority stock
holders cay they were not represented.
The dredging company, which has been
incorporated but a short time, has a cap
ital stock of $1(W,000 and has assets al
leged to be of the value of $75,000, con
sisting of the big steam dredgers Python
and Anaconda and their equipment. The
principal complaint of t-he minority stock
holders is that the Python has been sold
by the majority stockholders to Concan
non for $22,500. alleged to be $15,000 less
than her true value.

SPURNED SUITOR'S
ALLEGED CRIME
Second Trial of James
Cuff Begun.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, April 15.â The case of the
people vs. James Cuff, now on trial in
the Superior Court of Modoc County,
brings into prominence a dastardly at
tempt to take the lives of a lover and
his sweetheart by a rival suitor. Three
years ago James Cuff and A. M. Mil
ler were rivals for the hand of Miss
Lusk. Cuff was wealthy and was de
termined to win the young lady by fair
means or foul. Miss Lusk favored his
rival. When Cuff saw his case was
hopeless he attempted to take the life
of the girl he professed to love.
One night he slipped up to her house,
tore off a window screen and threw a
handkerchief saturated with chloro
form upon the face of his sleeping
sweetheart. The handkerchief found in
the room belonged to Cuff and the
tracks at the bedroom window cor
responded to those of Cuff.
A. M. Miller, the favored suitor, also
was the object of the rejected lover's
vengeance. Miller kept bachelor apart
ments. Strychnine was introduced into
his sugarbowl â a full half ounce. He
put two teaspoonsful Into his coffee
and a few minutes after partaking of
the beverage was in convulsions. By
superhuman efforts his life was saved.
Circumstantial evidence pointed to
Cuff as the poisoner. He was arrested,
tried, convicted and sentenced to
twenty years in the State penitentiary.
The case was appealed to the Supreme
Court and a new trial was ordered, on
the ground of irregularities. A chemi
cal analysis of the crystals remaining
in the strychnine phial and of the con
tents of the sugar bowl had not been
made. To provide against a repetition
of this irregularity on the second trial
District Attorney Bonner sent to Red
ding for Dr. Ferdinand Stabel, an au
thority on poisons and their effects.
Dr. Stabel made a chemical analysis of
the contents of the phial and the sugar
bowl and pronounced the foreign ele
ment strychnine. On the first trial it
was brought out that Cuff had pur
chased the poison in Alturas.
Dr. Stabel was on the stand three
days. He returned to Redding on Fri
day. The case is being tried before
Judge Harrington.
NO MORE MILK
IN GLASS JARS
Sanitary Innovation at
Los Angeles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 15.â The order
issued by the Los Angeles Board of
Health, forbidding dairymen to deliver
milk in glass jars to residences, went
into effect to-day.
"Our object," said Health Officer
Powers in answering criticisms upon
the measure, "is to compel people to
furnish their own receptacles for milk.
This involves largely a question of mi
crobes. Glass jars cannot be sterilized.
This was the ground on which a simi
lar order was made recently in Eng
land. People are less_cleanly about the
milk they use than "almost anything
else. Many people are simply ignorant
on the subject. Others are careless.
Glass jars can be thoroughly sterilized
with hot water, with hot air, which is
used in New York, or by other pro
cesses, but it is not always done.
"One housekeeper may cleanse a jar
thoroughly, another may only rinse it,
while another may use the bottle for
various purposes, or let it stand un
covered on the back porch before re
turning it. The dairymen should see
that all bottles are scalded before us
ing. Sometimes they do; generally they
don't. Then bottles are distributed
again and again, the same one prob
ably never going twice to one house.
This creates a wholesale opportunity
for carrying infection.
"People would not think of using a
tincup or dish of any kind that was
passed from house to house, yet it
would be no worse than to use these
milk jars that have been goodness
know? Avhere.
"It is a question similar to that of
the use of towels in public schools,"
continued Dr. Powers. "A State law
requires schools to be supplied with
towels. Possibly 100, 200 or 300 children
may use one towel, and it would b^
hard to find 100 children without a side
one among them. It is a poor law and
leads to a filthy and unsanitary prac
tice.
"Of course, it Is the same with a
towel in any public place. No one
wants to use a towel that has been
used by a sick person; but how is he
going to know who used it before him?
The sooner people learn the danger of
the promiscuous use of such things the
sooner disease will decrease."

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 16, 1899.
MOSS' PROBE ENRAGES
RICHARD CROKER, THE CHIEF
OF THE TAMMANY TIGERS
Gotham's Bourbon Boss Declines to Answer
Questions Concerning Tribute From Cor=
porations and Arraigns Mr* Platt.
NEW YORK, April 15.â The Mazet In
vestigating Committee continued its sit
tings to-day. The hearing took place in
the United States Criminal Court room,
scarcely large enough to accommodate
Â£00 persons. There were present eighty
four reporters and stenographers, leaving
little room for the many outsiders who
were anxious to hear what more Mr.
Croker had to say and what Mr. Moss had
to ask him.
When Klehard Croker, the Tammany chief
tah., was again placed on the witness stand
Mr. Moeg recalled the assertion made by him
yesterday that if it should be proved that he
had' received dishonest money from the city
he would allow his rlffbt arm to be cut off.
"Are you willing to make the proposition
that if dishonest money or dishonorable tran
sactions are laid at your .door you will part
with your fortune and with your liberty?"
asked Mr. Moss.
"Yes," said Croker.
"That is more to the point," replied Moss.
Croker declined to talk regarding his finan
cial connections when h- returned from Europe
in 1597. Ii was, he said, his personal affair.
This same reason was given about his giving
his son money to sro into the railroad .con
struction business.
"While n:y son has been in the Roebling
Company," said Croker, "it has never re
ceived a contract from the city, so that it does
not concern this committee at all.
"I have the utmost confidence in that boy,
and if you can destroy him in the city, as you
are working to do â this committee, it seems,
has made a set against my two sonsâ if you. can
destroy b,lm and not allow htm to go Into busi
ness 1 suppose you will do so. (Jo on and ex
amine Mr. Platt's firm," Croker said hotly,
"and find out what his boys are in if you want
to be honest. You go and examine the people
who brought you here t" examine us. â  That is
the gentleman (Mr. Platt) who puts you here
to examine us. You go and examine his firm.
They are at the foundation of all the corrup
tion in this city. I say there Is more corrup
tion In that firm 'to-dayâ and It Is run by all
or mostly all the corporations In this State
there is more corruption in that firm than any
where else. You go and examine that firm
now to be fair and brinff their books here."
Moss said the matter Croker had spoken of
was in no way concerned with the local gov
ernment.
"You make that matter In any way pertinent
to this inquiry and will examine Into it,"
said the lawyer. /;â '-
"The committee will throw It off," retorted
Crktr continued f> (lerlaini apainst th

DR. BRA AND HIS
CANCER MICROBE
Value of the Discovery
Yet Conjecture.
Special Cable to The Call and the Njw York
Herald. Copyrighted, Ib 9Â«, by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, April 15.â Some sensation has
i been caused of late by the discovery of
I Dr. Bra, and the press announcement
! that cancer microbe has been found . and
: isolated. The Herald has made a com
j plfte inquiry as far as 'possible into the
, matter in order to thoroughly ascertain
| the real value of the discovery and what
i fnight be expected of it.
i Dr Bra was Bald to have Isolated from can
j cerous tumors various kinds of lunsoid be
i longing to the ascomycetes tamlly. This para
! sit. was not only extracted from cancerous
tumors but was also cultivated t>y mixing with
I the blood of cancerous subjects. The blood is
i B aid to be fertile, only In later periods of the
I malady, when subjects have taken the pale
yellow color characteristic of cancer.
' This parasite 'la found in two lorms. in
spherules and cylindric celU. The spherules
! or pale light green color are round and consist
I of a protoplasmic mass, and outside the en
veloping membrane. They give rise to minute
spores in endogenous fashion. As to cylindric
cells of conlsia, they are refractive and are
six-thousandths of a millimetre long by two
thousandths of a millimetre broad, and these
; cells when they accumulate, can give rise to
absolute "mycelium." This parasite is probtc
i and can be cultivated at normal temperature,
and succeeds belt at 35 deÂ«reeÂ« centigrade, ihe
i spores however, will reelst temperature at
I boiling point for over an hour. Neither water
! nor desiccation alters its Testability to any
cI The culture can be made in beef tea or
sterilized milk or solid matters, a Jar of serum
gelatine or potatoes. There are certain cultures
which as they grow older assume a nne pink
C Â°t n iiis microscopic examinations of tumors
Dr Bra. found parasites in large quantities In
cells in the center or in cellular intervals. He j
I compares them to parasites which Souda Ker
wich Harier. Vilz, Szobraclng, Ruffcr and oth
ers have already discovered to be characteristic
Â°Dr Hra also claims to have in his experi
ments on animals by means of his cultures pro
duced acute and chronic Infections. These took
the form of tumors which varied automatically
from those which consisted of simple inflam
matory reaction to flbrosarcoma and real can-
Ce inoculatlon of this parasite also brought
about certain diseases of skin, ulcers in the
' stomach. Inflammation of the tongue and cirr
hosis and hypertrophy of the liver, especially
in the case of rabbits and does.
Such are the results which up to the present
: Dr Bra has achieved. Can they be accepted?
Thif< is not the opinion of Professor Curtis
I of Lille, who, making use of severe operating
I technique, only obtained negative results in
! twenty-five case.', but he suhmltted them to
i the three following conditions, and his opera
tions seem to have been excellently carried out:
1. He only employed for his inoculations
: absolutely fresh cancerous matter; as Boon as a
cancerous tumor was extirpated by the pur
-1 geon he carried out his inoculations with It.
2 He only used non-ulcerated tumors, and
â  these were not Infected artificially. As all
I ulcerate cancers of digestive or genital organs
I were more or less contaminated by secondary
I microbes of nil kinds and by ordinary fungoids
Professor Curtis only used cancers of the
I breast. >-.*â -Â».â¢â "'
3 He also confined himself to operating
1 quickly and antlneptleally.
' In working under these severe conditions all
' inoculations of dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, rats
; and mice by cultures, either solids or fluids,
1 remained negative.
The following are the conclusions which Pro
fessor Curtis drew from his experiments:
"On the whole I am of the opinion that can
cer from n. human subjectâ by this I mean
1 eplthellanâ ean neither be Inoculated in ani
mals usually employed in our laboratories nor
; cultivated in the usual fashion. The micro
i organism of cancer, If there is micro-organism,
has up to the present time evaded all re
tearch, hletological, experimental or bacterio
logical.
"I refuse to accept all observations of culture
and Inoculation of cancer which .have been
published, and to those who pretend to have
' succeeded I reply, place yourself In the condi
! tion I have Just laid, which a Judicious ex
perimental critic would insist on, and you will
i fail 88 I have done." . â  V
We have thus placed before the readers of
the Herald the whole case. We must, there
! fore, await the result of new experiments to
settle the dispute between observers who hold
such different orlnions.
There still, however, remains an Important
! point. Admitting that Dr. Bra's investigations
have been exact, is it possible to draw from
them any conclusions in regard to treatment?
To settle this question we addressed ourselves
to Dr. Bra, who replied by letter, from which
we <-'Xtr:ict tr,Â» following passage:
"As to treatment, I am much less advanced.
The whole matter is confined to certain clln-
Ical and experimental facts, resulting, from
the. Injection of soluble produ-ct of funirold of
i ancer. Though the results are very favorable,
, I will only be able to speaK of them in some
i months' time."
1 I glean from the foregoing statement by Dr.
i Bra that he Is nekins to treat cancer by ln-
I oculatlng with soluble productsâ that is to
i say. ,i soluble fermentation engendered by a
rultur?: of the parasite fungoids of asccimycetes,
j these latter beins ' cultivated in favorable
m'l'wn.
' Tli's method of Injecting soluble products
â¢ fabricated by the parasite, to vaccUwue with i
ments and we are responsible to the people for
them. You find one of the city departments
or any one In the city department who Is do-
Ing wrong and tell me, and I will be one of the
Cm persons to help get them out."
<'rnk'-r said he was not afraid of convicting
himself or of incriminating himself, but thought
there was no law or reason for Moss to come
. and examine Into his private a.ffairs.
Croker admitted that he had Instructions that
Assemblyman Redding ought to be reprimanded
for the Amsterdam grab.
"Have you not since January 1 been short
7000 shares of Manhattan stock jn one office at
Broad street?" a?ke<j Moss, changing the sub-
Ject.
<"rokor declined to answer.
Moss said thÂ» questions as to Manhattan
stock were asked because of the movements of
the Tammmiy organization with regard to the
Manhattan elevated questionâ "which are mat
ters of Federal knowledge." said Moss, "and
will be proved at their proper time."
"Did you not sell Manhattan stock in antici
pation of an attack upon the Manhattan Com
pany? Did you know that the departments of
the city government were going to make an
attack on the Manhattan elevated road? Did
DSUIt with members of the city govern
ment, the heads of the departments, in refer
actlons against the Manhattan Elevated
Railroad Company?"
To all of these and nthpr similar questions
Croker refused tn make any definite answer.
He did not know if his friend. Andrew Freed
man, had lost money In Manhattan stock. He
did not remember when Oenrge Gould came
to see him (Croker) at Lakewood in IS9S, and
discussed the extension of the elevated road.
It \v;is about five weeks ago, Croker stated,
that ho spoke to Mr. Gould about allowing the
I his air atnl power company to be sus
pended from the Manhattan structure. Up be
lieved Ji" 1 "" 1 was the Â«urn offered to the elevated
road for the required privilege.
In answer to an unexpected question Croker
said he did not lose money on Manhattan stock.
"How is it." asked Moss, "that you arc will-
Ing t" say that you did not lose money on the
stock and you were not willing to say that
you were not short of the stock?"
"I did that Just to please you." said Croker.
Croker denied that an Investigation In the
elevated rend had been ordered with the ob
: compelling it to allow the stringing of
air and power pipes along its structure. Again
and again Croker refused to tell of his rela
tions with companies.
"We have a right to know how a man who
controls the municipal actions is able to go
and put his hand on business men and put
tli.-ir stock In his pocket for nothing. You
dart- not say that you have not done it, do
â 
"Dar â¢.'." aid i'r iker ; shlngr; then,
in quieter tones, he added: "No, I won't til
my private-- affairs." and Moss Bald:
"You Isn't it a fact, Mr. Croker,
that, simply because you are the leader of
Tammany Hall, and because, as such leader,
you control the city departments, you have
It against that action of the parasite itsplf,
or to cure the maladies It engenders by the
hipi.' parasit< -this method, we Bay, la abso
lutely rational, and It is probable that if Dr.
Ura has discovered the parasite of cancer, he
is following at this moment the best means
for arriving ut the successful treatment of the
disease. Butâ for there Is a butâ has he really
discovered the parasite of cancer?
It cannot be denied that the objections of
Professor Curtis are extremely Important. The
<â :â  rf- with which Dr. Bra has conducted his
experiments cannot be denied, but, on weigh
ing Judicially the pros and cons, one cannot
help being skeptical in regard to the discovery
fit th( microbe of cancer. We believe, wever,
that fresh li tlgationa are being undertaken
fn this direction by a very competent man of
science.
WILD GAMBLING IN
ENGLISH SOCIETY
One Lady Loses a Year's Pin Money
and Another Loses Herself to
Win a Husband.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
- â  â 
LONDON, April IS.â Reference has been
made In a previous letter to how society
have in large numbers taken to
speculating on "change. Large sums of
money have been lost arid won in that
way. but card parties, which have 1 n
very numerous of late, have bad more
startling results. Whist and poker have
bet n responsible for much of the trouble.
and the new game of bridge is exercising
a remarkable fascination over the ladies
in particular. As an example of the in
discretion to which some are rushing a
society journal narrated the story of how
a lady lost Â£2000, representing the whole
Of her pin money for a year, during holy
week.
Apropos of this showing of the other
Bide of the picture hitherto unpublished,
a story is told of an interesting card play
ing tourney. A very rich man sat playing
pscarte with a pretty girl whom he In
tensely admired. She went on recklessly
staking her money until ruin stared her
in the faro.
"Doubles or quits." Faid the tempter.
She assented, knowing that she could
never pay. She lost.
"Yourself or quits." paid her opponent.
Again the girl summoned all her wits and
looked him straight in the face.
"Are you proposing to marry me? 1 ' she
asked.
He nodded. He won the game and the
pair made one of the happiest unions
known in England at the present day.
TRAIL TO DAWSON
BESET BY DANGERS
Alarm for the Safety of Hundreds of
Persons Now Traveling to the
Klondike.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 15.â The Btram
er Amur, which arrived this evening,
brought a number of Klondlkers. among
whom were John de Land and Dr. J. T.
Kelly, the latter formerly a dentist of
San Francisco. Dr. Kelly has been in the
interior for eighteen months, during
which time he has been very successful,
both in the Dawson and the American
districts.
Dr. Kelly and those who came out with
him are much concerned for the safety
of the hundreds of people who are now
on the trail on route to Dawson, many
of whom are not further along than Carl
boo and Tagish.
At Marsh Lake five days ago there were
t>!i inches of water on the ice. and the
same condition existed at Fifty-miie

given a large -amount of stock to secure your
Influence?"
Croker laughed. "No," he said; "you are
away off." Croker said that he was a practi
cal locomotive builder. He was not worth a
million dollars. He declined to answer when
asked If he was not given $140,ui.>0 of the Auto-
Truck stock without the payment of a dollar.
In . reply to a question regarding the con
trol of street franchises, Croker placed the
responsibility upon the city departments.
Croker said he did not Interfere in patron
age.
"I never ask for a place for a person," he
declared.
"Sometimes they make it worth your while
not to object, don't they?" asked Moss.
"No, sir," said Croker.
Croker said he thought the police ought to try
to close gambling houses In the city by a
real and earnest effort.
"You secured the closing of poolrooms once,
did you not?" asked the counsel.
"I don't know whether I did or not. I said
they ought to be stopped," replied Croker.
"You said It to Byrnes one day, did you
not?"
"Yes. Fir."
"And they stopped?"
"I don't know.".
Croker denied he had spoken to Byrnes be
cause the poolrooms interfered with his rac
ing matters. He said he had talked to Devery
about poolrooms, as he did to .Byrnes, and
would say It again.
"We will wait and see If they are closed
to-morrow," said M
Croker replied that when Moss was pru
rient of the Police Board ne wouldn't close
them.
Croker declined to say If he owned 8000
shares of the Huckleberry railroad at a time
when there was legislation pending at Albany
affecting that railroad.
Mess asked Croker if he did not receive from
Bourke Cockran part of the latter's fee for
getting a resolution through the Board of Al
dermen at the time when the Broad-street
Railroad changed its motive power from
horsepower to cable. Croker did not remem
ber that he received any money. Finally
Croker said he would only swear that he did
Dot remember receiving it.
"When you received from Cockran a sum
of money, did you not have a further conver
sation and ask him for more?" Insisted Moss.
"i object tv answering."
"And did not he refuse to give you more?"
Again the witness objected to answer.
"I don't remember anything about it. There
is no foundation at all for that. Cockran
wanted to be a United States Senator, and,
It you want to know, I opposed him I
we thought he was not a man fit for the
place. We had a man whom we preferred."
"I decline to answer," was Croker's answer
to many other questions as to whether he had
Bought money from various corporations.
The session was then adjourned until Mon
day rimming, when Croker's examination will
be continued.
was guiding a sled, slipped" through the
ice, which pave way under him. He held
to the sled, to which five dogs were at
tached, and was pulled out after having
been in water up to his waist. It was a
narrow escape, as the wate> at that point
was quite deep. Owing to the present
condition of the trail both Kelly and De
Land said It was now extremely hazard
ous to start for Dawson. exjtecting to '
make the trip by the winter route.
BELIEVE THEY ARE ON
THE TRAIL OF MOORE
Nevada City Officials Following a
New Lead in Bear River
Canyon.
NEVADA CITY. April IB.â A courier
reached here late last night with the
news that a rancher In (he lower part of
the county, while searching through the
thickets alonp Bear River Canyon, near
Placer County line, had come across a
camp fire that was yet smoking. The
tracks of a man and dog were found, and
as the camp was In an almost Inaccessi
ble locality, far from the line of travel
for tramps, it is confidently believed by
the Bear Valley settlers that Moore, the
fugitive murderer of Policeman Kilroy,
and his faithful dog are haunting trie
canyon.
Early this morning Sheriff Getchell,
City Marshal] Tompkins, Deputy Sheriff
Pascoe and Captain Mitchell of tho Na
tional Guard hurried to the point of dis
covery. At a late hour to-night they had
not returned and the opinion is that they '
have the outlaw of I,ittle Deer Creek
corraled in the canyon or have struck
his trail leading to the southwest and are
following it.
SAW MRS. GEORGE FIRE
THE FATAL SHOTS
Sexton's Slayer Positively Identified
as the Assassin by Two
Witnesses.
CANTON, Ohio, April 15.â Attorneys for i
the State regard this as the red letter day
in the trial of Mrs. George. They pro
duced eye-witnesses to the firing of two
of the shots which took effect in Saxton's
body. One of these claimed to have iden
tified Mrs. George positively and the
other testified that the woman she saw
do the shooting closely resembled Mrs.
Grnrgp. whom she knew only as she has
seen her in the courtroom.
The State also qualified a witness on
Airs. George's handwriting to identify a
letter which they want to Introduce in
evidence. They want to prove that Mayor
Rice, as counsel for Mrs. George, told
where to lind the weapon and sent
after it. |
BEFORE THE BEEF COURT.
Army Officers Testify Concerning the
Meat Supplied.
WASHINGTON, April la.-Tha Wado
court of inquiry did not conclude the ex
amination of witnesses before adjourning
to-day, as had been hoped, but when ad
journment was reached there were only
two more witnesses In sight. The wit
nesses to-day Included Inspector General
Breckinridge, General Gilmore and Colo
nels Bird and A. L. Smith of the commis
sary department and Professor W. O. At
water. The officers called related their
varied experiences with the beef supplied
to the army, and Professor At water gave
the results not only of chemical analysis
of the canned beef but of experiments
made with it upon persons in his labora
tory. He found the beef wholesome ac
cording to the chemical tests, but in one
of the experiments the subjects experi
enced failure of appetite and aversion to
the food.

CHAVEZ DIES ON
THE SCAFFOLD
Condemned Man Was
"Game" to the Last.
ppeclal Dispatch to Thr Call.
SAN QUENTIN PRISON, April 15.â
Manfuel Chavez was executed this>
morning: for one of the most brutal and
cowardly murders ever recorded in this
State. Indian blood flowed in the mur
derer's veins and, true to the traditions
of his race, he walked upon the scaf
fold and went to his death with the
resignation and indifference of a stoic.
The condemned man waived the read
ing of the death warrant, and with
Guards Arbograst and Merritt on either
side walked firmly up the steps of the
scaffold and took his position on th*
trap. He was preceded by Rev. Father
Lagan of San Rafael and Rev. Father
Vallidamat of San Francisco. Guard
Arbogast proved himself the worthy
successor of Amos Lunt as hangman,
and no bungling marred the fulfillment
of the law's decree. The trap fell at
10:32, and life was pronounced extinct
in ten and a half minutes. The body
twitched and jerked so convulsively for
five minutes that the majority of those
present were convinced the fall of five
feet and seven inches was insufficient
for Chavez's light weight, and that he
died of strangulation.
In addition to Dr. Lawlor, the prison
physician, Drs. W. J. TVickman and J.
Keck of San Rafael were present at the
execution.
A peculiar incident occurred during
the progress of the execution, which
was especially marked by the supersti
tious. As Chavez entered the execution
chamber a little English sparrow flitted
silently in at a window and, perching
upon a rafter near the scaffold, ap
peared to watch the gruesome specta
cle. As the trap fell it gave a faint
"cheep" and ten seconds afterward
darted out again into the sunlight.
The crime expiated by Chavez was
the murder of Gregoria Rodriguez in
San Diego' County on May 14, 1897. Fiv*.
days previously the woman, who had
lived with Chavez for some time, left
him and went to the house of a neigh
bor. He followed her and, upon being
told she would not return, slashed her
on the arm. She ran and fell fainting
on the rear porch. Chavez then cut
her throat and stabbed her a dozen
times.
INDIANS MAY ENLIST.
But No Two Red Men Can Serve in
the bame Command.
NEW YORK, April 15.â A Washington
special to the HeTald says: Instructions
have been issued by the War Department
to army recruiting officers advising them
to enlist Indians of education. Six voune
men from the Carlisle School have **.l
--j ready entered the service, two of whom
I have been sent to Cuba, one to Porto Rico
1 and one to the Philippines. The depart
; ment has no intention of forming any
I Indian organizations such as were formed
several years ago and proved to be fail
ures, but Indians who may enlist will be
distributed among the various regiments
so that there will not be two red men in
the same command.

The following cablegram has been re

â MANILA. April 15.â Secretary of the

and order there. Most friendly to

The announcement of the successful
i establishment of the native government
in the Island of Guam Is a matter of
, deep satisfaction In official circles, and
| especially the information that the na
tives are most friendly disposed toward
' this country. As the?.- j pp c arP

maintenance of order on the island and

Guam, administration officials con

the new Governor General or this Gov

however, will be maintained by the
American officials.
With the arrival of the Yosemite in
about sixty days the labor of creating
adequate quarters for the American
colony "ill begin. Guam has already
been selected ac a naval coaling station
by the Navy Department, and contracts
were awarded several weeks ago for
the location of suitable piers, ware
houses and coal sheds for receiving
large quantities of coal. It will event
ually he an important stopping place
for vessels en route from the Pacific
Coast to Manila. Samoa and Australia,
and with the station at Pearl Harbor,
Hawaii, one at Pago-Pago, near Apia,
and another at Cavlte there will be
facilities for coaling ships on the Pa
cific unequaled by any foreign power.
Aside from Croat Britain the I'nited
States now holds coaling stations or
cessions of land upon which to estab
lish them, equal to "those of all the
other nations combined. There is prac
tically no power that so completely
dominates the Pacific now as this coun

taken to even erect coal sheds at Sa
moa, while now work is practically
progressing at all stations.

PROSECUTION OF
SENATOR QUAY
Telling Evidence Has
Been Admitted.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
PHILADELPHIA, April 1R â Th*
prosecution in the trial of United States
Senator Quay succeeded to-day in hav
ing admitted as evidence the books
found in Cashier Hopkins' desk after
the People's Bank failure, and on the
pages of which the commonwealth al
leges will be found the evidences of
conspiracy between Mr. Quay, late ex-
State Treasurer B. J. Haywood and
John S. Hopkins, the dead cashier.
These books are the famous "red book,"
over which the legal battle as to its
admissibility has waged since' the early
part of the week and which ended to
day in a complete victory for the pros
ecution, and the others are those known
as the "black book" and the "blue
book."
In the "red hook," is is charged by the
prosecution, will be found calculations
by Hopkins of interest on State funds
on which interest was paid to State
Treasurer Haywood and to Senator
Quay.
The "black book" contains records
and entries pertaining to stock trans
actions alleged to connect the defend
ant with Hopkins in using State funds
for speculation.
The "blue book" is asserted to be a
record of individual loans made by
Cashier Hopkins, and it is charged that
It will show that Senator Quay was
loaned money without security.
Throughout the week there has been
skirmish after skirmish between coun
sel as the line of evidence drew closer
to the subject matter In the red book.
The placing on the stand yesterday by
THE EMPORIUM.
District Attorney Rothermel of Meyer
Goldsmith precipitated the battle which
routed the forces of the defense on tho
point at issue.
The decision was based entirely on
the answer of the expert to the ques
tion, "Do you, in your opinion as an
expert, from an examination of the
book known as* the 'rod book,' consider
it a book of the hank?" and Mr. Gold
smith's reply, "It is undoubtedly a book
of the bank."
The combined wisdom and skill of
Mr. Quay's counsel was directed at the
witness in crops-examination. He was
made to admit that there were many
clerical errors in tho book; that the
pages wore not numbered; that many
of the entries were in lead pencil; that
he never knew of a bank keeping en
tries in such a manner, and that th%
bank's regular books contained no r. f
erence to the red book. It was just
after the expert had finished his testi
mony to-day that the forces lined up
for the final test.
David Watson of Pittshurg in a clear,
i compact and concise manner presented
the objections in a masterly and elo
quent manner. The District Attorney's
reply was remarkably brief and to the
point. He maintained that it was a
! book of the bank according' t" an ex
| pert, because a thorough understand
ing of the affairs of the bank could not
be reached without it. Judge Biddies
decision sustained the District Attor
ney.

c FIGHT FOR DECENCY.
Till-; CALL'S fight for decency has been won.
graphic pictures in local phono
graph galleries will have to be turned toward
the wall. John Carroll, the first of the proprietors of
such establishments to be arrested by reason of this
's expose of their vile exhibitions, has been
fine'! ffense, and Acting Police Judge Barry
announced from the bench that his next offense of
this character would be visited with the extreme pen
â¢ c law. A similar fate, he said, would over
take Carroll's fellow-pan derers of this particular form
c: pruriency.
The fine imposed on Carroll was altogether inade
quate to the offense, but the court explained that it
fixed at the sum of $10 not with the idea that the
law had been satisfied with such a penalty, but that,
being the prisoner's first offense, he might have
warning of what he might expect in the future. In
iew of it no exception can be taken to the court's
judgment.
In passing sentence upon Carroll, Judge Barry took
occasion to vent his opinion concerning the style of
exhil demned by The Call. In it he bore out
every statement published by this paper concerning
the evils of the phonograph parlor as it had been con
ducted up to the time of the raid following the expose.
"The pictures are suggestively immoral," he said,
"and it is a bad thing for children to be schooled in
immorality by the payment of a nickel. It is even
bad enough for adults, and is opposed to the good
morals of the community."
Neither the fine nor the lecture seemed to have
much effect on Carroll, but it is safe to say that he will
not care to take a second chance of a violation of the
law.
JUDGE MOGfIN'S CHARGE.
THE CALL'S criticism of Judge Mogan's charge
to the jury in the Jones case was founded upon
a report in a morning paper which purported to
contain a synopsis of one of its paragraphs. We re
luctantly assumed its truth, for Judge Mogan has not
previously given us any ground for believing that he
would deliberately deliver a charge calculated to effect
the acquittal of the accused in this case. We there
fore cheerfully note what he says with reference to
the matter in an interview with a Call reporter yester
day. Undoubtedly, as he avers, a defendant has a
right to request the court to deliver certain instruc
tions, but the right of the court to refuse to deliver
instructions which will prejudice the case in either
direction is also undoubted When the evidence
shows that an accus< n is guilty a criminal
Judge has no moral right to accept instructions which,
it heeded by the jury, will cause his acquittal.
Judge Mogan in his judicial robes is supposed to
be a stern and unrelenting minister of justice. He is
net placed upon the bench of the Police Court to act
as a dummy for any attorney, and when he perceives
that the proof in a specified case' establishes the guilt
of a person charged with crime, it is his duty to main
tain the law with such severity as he may think the
ease demands.
We credited the report upon which our criticism
was founded ir.orc because, of the result in the Jones
case than because we thought Judge Mogan had de
liberately attempted to acquit the accused. The
evidence was dear that Jones had committed .the
offense of gambling at the Ingleside racetrack. Vet
the jury stood ten to two for acquittal. It seemed to
us that unless the jury was composed of men
avowedly in sympathy with racetrack gambling such
a result would be impossible. It the Ingleside gam
blers arc fixing juries in Judge Mogan's court it is
his duty to put a stop to the practice.
We arc not disposed to hold Judges to a too strict
accountability, for we know that their powers are
limited and that the wool is frequently pulled over
their eyes by the tricky lawyers and officials who sur
round them. But Judge Mogan is a capable man,
who thoroughly understands his business, and it is to
be hoped that he will keep his eyes open when the
ca^es of these Inglesidc gamblers come before him.
What we have said will do him no harm if its effect
shall be to arouse him to renewed vigilance. He
will be judged finally according to the whole record,
not by the result in a specified case.
THE SfIMOAN DIFFICULTY.
YON BULOW, the German Minister for Foreign
Affairs, in his statement of the Samoan ques
tion, made to the Reichstag, said: "Regarding
the history of the complications in Samoa, I have
inadc a statement to the budget committee and have
; particularly pointed out how, since the coming into
j force of the act (the tripartite treaty) disturbances
and frictions between the representatives of the
powers have not been lacking."
Looked at in a spirit of calmness, from the stand
point of American interests, one is compelled to won
der that such an agreement as that with England and
: Germany was ever entered into at all. The three na
j tions are there, on terms of treaty equality, to oversee
I and direct the tribal government of about 40.000 na
tives, who have been divided into parties and factions
for many years. Their divisions have been accen
tuated by the missionaries of different Christian
: creeds, and their later rivalries and riots have been
! embittered, beyond even those of the cannibal days,
jby this new factor of confusion. The kingship of
those people is something of but small importance to
1 the outside world. It in no way influences the crop of
; cocoanuts and its conversion into copra, which is
I about the only product of the islands capable of being
put in condition to find the distant markets of the
i world. German, English and American planters have
1 plantations there and raise cocoanuts and ship the
â  dried pulp as the raw material of an oil that is used
iin making fine soap?. But. as far as known, the rights
of these planters have usually been as well respected
i as the rights of miners and land-owners are in other
I parts of the world. A consular officer or commercial
' agent of the three Governments located at Apia, with
instructions to prevent the sale of firearms and fire
water to the natives, would be able to protect all the
. interests of the three nations. The climate is tropical,
i white labor cannot be employed, and permanent
â  white colonization is impossible. The natives will
j perform only the crude labor of bursting cocoanut
! shells with a club gathering the pulp when it has
' dried in the sun and separated from the shell. They
wait with patience for the nuts to fall and have a
capacity for rest that is admirable. Armed only with
, their primitive weapons, their political feuds might be
; fought out with no more danger to the few white
planters and storekeepers than is incurred by the
audience which yells at a football match from the safe
; distance of the bleachers.
There have been some ridiculous adventures in
i government before, but hardly any equal to the one
undertaken by us and our two partners in Samoa.
Great warships of the three nations swelter and shine
in the tropical sun at Apia, and each one costs the tax
payers annually as much as the value of the entire
trade of the islands secured by each country. The
three representatives of the three partners, having
nntliing else to do, indulge in native politics. When
: Germany shuts out our pork or refuses our dried
; peaches in fear of the San Jose scale, our represcnta
: tive in Samoa feels it his duty to incite evil among
: the natives against the representative of our German
1 partner.
When German jealousy looks with verdant eye
upon our feats in the Philippines the representative
'â  of the Kaiser whispers hatred into the particular
j Samoan ear that he controls. So, the jealousies and
! rivalries of the three Governments, their trade de
; vices, policies and competitions, are focused and
! compressed within the narrow borders of Apia and
i the natives are converted into enemies or partisans
of the American hog and dried peach. No wonder
j that Yon Bulow has taken the budget committee into
; his confidence in the matter of these frictions and
â¢ difficulties.
As for the Samoans, they are suffering from being
! governed too much, and would gain greatly if left to
i themselves, with the sole injunction that they must
not eat each other. They have as much right to in
dulge in dynastic battles as the English had to
; luxuriate in skull-cracking during the Wars of the
I Roses, or we to have our quadrennial mud-slinging in
a Presidential campaign. It is to be hoped that Ger
many is tired enough of the business to propose that
all three pull out of it, for it is likely that the United
! States and England would be glad to do so.
It should be noted that we are falling into the com
mission habit as the result of these outside complica
tions. We have had a Hawaiian Commission to re
port a government for those islands, and its report
is sleeping on the files of the last Congress. We
have a large commission in the Philippines waving
the olive branch over a desolation created by our
great gun?. Commissioners have gone to the West
Indian islands, and now a Commissioner is on his way
to Samoa, there to meet the Commissioners of Eng
land and Germany, under instructions to be unani-
moos or nothing.
The Samoan business has brought us as near to
war with Germany as we were to war with Spain two
years ago, and Mr. Hull, chairman of the Military
Committee of the House, has announced that the
people out in lowa have a thirst for German gore.
It is to be hoped that common sense will prevail
and that the three great countries will at least show
as much self-control as the Samoans.
OUR STATE LEGISLATURES.
/\/l R. SYDNEY WEBB, who is now delivering a
/ \ course of lectures at the London School of
* * Economics and Political Science on the work
ing of the American constitution, has been giving ut
terance to some very decided opinions upon our State
govcrnmeiV nd a brief review published in the
London Chronicle of one of his lectures on that sub
ject contains much that will be interesting, if for no
other reason than that of showing what an intelli
gent foreign critic thinks of them.
The lecturer notes in the first place that American
State governments are more obscure to foreigners,
and to a considerable number of home people, than
almost any other civilized governments known to po
litical science. He attributes this obscurity to the
custom of establishing the State government not in
the metropolis of the State, but in a small provincial
town where people rarely go. The executive offices
are therefore hidden from the public. Then the Leg
islatures are restricted in all sorts of ways by State
constitutions, and in most States sit but once in two
years and then for a limited time.
Speaking of the effects of these conditions Mr.
Webb went on to say that although the American
States nominally deal with many of the most important
departments of government, such as education, fac
tory legislation, sanitation, the criminal code, the
police, and practically the whole law of property and
contracts, they are rapidly shrinking up and occupy
ing an ever-dwindling share of public interest. There
are, speaking broadly, no distinctively State politics.
The result is that the State Legislatures arc even less
under public control than Congress. State elections
are often hotly contested, but invariably as part of the
general Presidential campaign, never on local issues.
Under these circumstances results the most extensive
exhibition of legislative futility that the world has
yet seen. The forty odd State Legislatures "solemnly
go on grinding out new laws, but, except in one or
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 16, 1899,
two States, these are so badly drafted and so chaotic
that even if they are not declared void the first time
they come before the courts they are for the most
part not enforced.
While objections might be urged to some of the
points of that arraignment, the justice of it generally
cannot be denied. Despite the great importance of
the subjects of legislation reserved for them to deal
with, it is unquestionably true our State Legislatures
come very near deserving the reproach of being
"the most extensive exhibition of legislative futility
the world has yet seen."
It is of course to be regretted that such should be
the case, fory "notwithstanding the restrictions placed
upon them, jt is within the power of these legislative
bodies to be of vast usefulness in promoting the wel
fare of the commonwealths they serve. Mr. Webb
is in error when he attributes tjhe futility of the Legis
lature in any great degree to the fact that State gov
ernments are established in small towns. Thetruecause
of the evil is the quality of men who serve in the
Legislature. Whenever the American people develop
such a true loyalty that the best citizens will be will
ing to serve the State in the Legislature, then the age
of futility in State governments will pass away and a
new era of activity and usefulness begin.
OUR BOYS IN THE PHILIPPINES.
WAR in the Philippines is no longer what it was
in the early days of the contest with Spain.
We have no longer a nation great in history
for a foe, and there is no chance for another thrilling
and spectacular victory like that which Dewey won
in Manila harbor. The romance and the glory of
the contest are over, and we have now reached that
stage of war where there is nothing but weary
marches, daily fighting with an ambushed or flying
foe, and a continuous exposure to conditions that
breed disease and threaten death.
Just for the reason that there is no longer any
glory in the war, the campaign which Otis is now
waging is a far more trying test of the stuff our sol
diers are made of than was that splendid feat of naval
arms that destroyed the Spanish fleet in the Orient
and aroused the nations to a recognition of the fact
that the United States have become a world power
indeed â one to be reckoned with in all questions of
supremacy at sea, having not only great ships and
great guns, but the courage and skill required to use
them with efficiency in battle.
The men who are driving the followers of Aguin
aldo from the jungles and the marshes of the island
of Luzon are fighting under the most adverse con
ditions. The Filipino is as savage as the American
Indian, and even more cunning. If he were anything
like a good marksman he would in his rice fields and
canebrakes be one of the most formidable barbarians
in the world. It is, therefore, no easy task that our
boys have before them. It is going to be more diffi
cult to whip the Filipino than the Spaniard, and
there will be no glory in it when done.
The campaign against Aguinaldo has been con
ducted with untiring energy and with conspicuous
valor. The natives have been taught the difference
between Americans and Spaniards, and the effect of
the lesson cannot fail to be wholesome. There has
been no halt in the swift pursuit of the flying enemy.
The end cannot be far off. Before the rainy season
sets in the island of Luzon or at least all the culti
vated districts will probably be cleared of the armed
bands of Aguinaldo who have been levying tribute
on the inhabitants and rendering industry well nigh
impossible.
The country can watch with pride the manner in
which her volunteers are bearing themselves under
the tropical sun and the harassing burdens of this
wretched war. They are showing not only valor on
the field of battle, but a steady discipline in the camp
and on the march, which proves them to be worthy
of the best traditions of the armies of the republic.
The whole course of the Philippine campaign could
indeed be regarded with national pride and satisfaction
were it not that it entails a sacrifice of brave men for
the sake of a victory that will be worth nothing to
this or to any other generation.
ANTI-NEWSPAPER LEGISLATION.
THE Evening Post of this city â or rather the
Southern Pacific Company through the agency
of the Evening Post â has hastened to defend the
Southern Pacific Company against the accusation of
The Call that the railroad was the sponsor, agitator
and defender of the anti-newspaper legislation which
was adopted at the last session of the Legislature and
which was made operative by the signature of Gov
ernor Gage. The Post asks The Call to submit the
proofs of its accusation.
It seems like carrying coals to Newcastle to answer
the request, but if the Post is seeking information it
is referred to the author of its own editorial, which
denies railroad responsibility and insists upon the jus
tice of the anti-newspaper laws, and to the recent con
ference between William F. Herrin and C. P. Hun
tington. At that conference the campaign against
independent newspapers was planned. The editorial
request of the Post is one of the first skirmishes of
the Southern Pacific Company in the fight to silence
honest newspaper criticism.
It is understood that Colonel Schwartzkoppen and
Colonel Panizzardi have become involved in the
Dreyfus affair. In an exchange of civilities these
gentlemen might become embarrassed. In hostilities
they could hardly use anything more deadly than
their names. They might choke to death before they
could fight.
Governor Gage's statement in a recent interview,
"I have tried to free myself from the cares of state
and to prepare myself for the future labor my office
imposes," raises a question as to what are the duties
of his office for which he can prepare himself by free
ing his mind from the cares of state.
George J. Denis, whom Governor Gage will ap
point a Code Commissioner, says, with some em
phasis, that he is not a lackey of the people of Cali
fornia. If the gentleman continues hi this lofty strain
he may find that his name is Mud and not Denis.
The story that Kaiser William intends to raise his
brother, Prince Henry, to the rank of King and be
stow the Chinese province of Shantung upon him for
a kingdom is a good enough yarn for Oriental uses
probably, but it won't wash in this climate.
Should Secretary Wadham of the Eureka society
insist on arresting for vagrancy any more two-year
old infants like Baby Aubray it might be well to arm
the policemen with nursing-bottles instead of clubs.
John F. Carroll, Croker's lieutenant, testified the
other day before the Mazet committee that "what
Mr. Croker says goes." It's a pity that the boss
could not have put in a word for the Keely motor.
The women of Santa Clara County interested in
equal suffrage have expressed their disappointment
at Governor Gage. There are others.
IN FAVOR OF THE PANHANDLE.
To the Editor of the 'San Francisco
Callâ Sir: Please permit me to answer a
letter recently published in your paper
in opposition to the extension of the park
panhandle. The letter was written by a
man who owns a house and lot on the
line of the projected improvement, to
which he is therefore opposed. He does
not want to move out of the way. He
takes a short view, consulting his own
interests. We want men in San Fran
cisco who are capable of taking broad
views and who desire to give to this
Western city as much beauty and com
fort as the hundreds of thousands of
Americans annually seek In Europe.
Paris, Vienna, Berlin and London have
within the last thirty years hewn down
solid blocks of buildings at an enormous
expense in order to beautify their cities
by making parks and boulevards. They
bring their parks by spacious avenues
into the very heart of these cities, and as
a result there is not only a happy and
contented population, but there are my
riads of visitors making- homes In .places
which consider the pleasant side of. life
and the happiness and health, as well as
the commerce and trade, of its people.
How many men of your acquaintance
do not go to the park because of the
difficulties of getting there? They want
to be able to drive or ride or bicycle or
walk from as near their homes and places
of business as possible.
Kncoui?aging the use of the park would
confer health upon the hard-workers of
the great city. The poor man will be
lured by the beautiful picture, trees and
lawns, to walk where he now rides.
Instead of "destruction of beautiful
property," according; to your correspond
ent, it will be the improvement and bet
terment of property, which has no great
value nor beauty, and which is used
but in partâ large sections of it being un
occupied.
Instead of abandoned carhouses, rook
eries, and an occasional dwelling, mere
will be a public common for the benefit
and use of all. Your correspondent says
that the benefits will accrue, instead of to
the public, to "contractors and builders
and to their followers." There is much
truth in this. These people â Rill derive
benefit, but who arc they? They are the
laborers and mechanics of San Fran
cisco â carpenters, plumbers, material
men, cabinet-makers, furniture-rnak'ers
and all employments and vocations hav
ing to do with the construction and fur
nishing of a house.
He shows his ignorance by saying that
another class who profit are those who
have the "handling of the Phebe Hearst
donation for beautifying the city." There
is no such fund. Mrs. Hearst is merely
going to provide a plan and the money
will afterward have to be raised. He
says it is only for "those who can afford
to drive out for pleasure." If this
gentleman goes to the park on a holiday
EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNfIUGhT.
"With all of its ugliness and its hor
rors war remains the finest and most
effective of theaters for the display of
heroism. Under no other circumstances '
and with no other background do valor |
and fidelity show so brilliantly to the
imagination and appeal so thrillingly
to the sympathies of the heart. An in
cident of thp fight made by a small
force of American and British marines
against the Samoans who had en
trapped them in an ambuscade on April
1 strikingly illustrates the fact, and the
story merits as many repetitions as it
is likely to receive.
When Lieutenant Freeman of th>
royal navy was killed Lieutenant Lans
dale of the United States navy took
command, ami he in turn was soon
brought to the ground by a ball which
shattered his leg. The next to take
charge of the detachment was Lieu
tenant Cave, who, perceiving that his
men were exposed to a galling fire and
that the onÂ» effective weapon of his
force, a Colt gun, was out of order and
could not be used, gave orders to re
treat. Five wounded men were carried
with the retreating troops, but Lans
dale was left on the field with Free
man, the supposition being that both
were dead. One man. Seaman Hunt of
the British ship Porpoise, did not re
treat with the others, but stayed v/|ih
Lansdale and defended the wounded
American until he himself was knocked
senseless by a blow on the head.
Hunt did not succeed in saving the
officer for whom he showed himself so
willing to give his life, but his action
was none the less meritorious because
it failed in its purpose. There is a
genuine heroism of the highest kind in
that seaman who stayed to face the
savages in an effort to save an officer
not of his navy, nor of his nation. The
scene of Hunt's struggle with the horde
of infuriated Samnans over the body of
Lansdale would make a good picture;
even as the right telling of it would
make a good poem. It is gratifying to
know that he escaped alive. It is also
gratifying to remember he serves a na
tion that never fails to reward such
service as he has rendered. His chance
of getting the coveted Victoria cross
and a pension is so good that many an
officer in her Majesty's fleet would be
glad to change places with him "when
the Porpoise goes home to report to the
'"Widow of Windsor."
If this were a campaign year, when
political thrusts are justifiable in the
daily intercourse of life, the recent Jef
fersonian banquets would afford much
amusement to the public, since in the
wide chasm between the Jeffersonian
ism of the New York feast and that of
the Milwaukee frugal repast there is
scope and opportunity for many a ver
bal stab that would reach our Demo
cratic friends in the short ribs and
make them writhe. This, however, is
a season of political peace. The toma
hawk is buried and the scalping knife
sheathed. Throughout the polite world
there is a desire to say the pleasant
word to such Democrats as are met in
good company and to talk of these
banquet dissensions as if they were not
dissensions but modes of harmony.
Such being the case it is worth while
to direct attention to a precedent
which, if followed, will enable any one
to talk politics to Democrats without
being offensive to either faction.
When Artemus Ward went to Boston
to see the sights some of his warm
hearted hosts took him to a certain
venerable-looking old house and as
sured him it was the birthplace of Ben
jamin Franklin. Next day another set
of entertainers, equally warm-hearted,
showed him a building in quite a dif
ferent part of the city and with posi
tiveness asserted that to be Franklin's
birthplace. Having thus been made
aware of the civil war in Boston on
tfcat subject the genial humorist did
not take side with either party; neither
did he offend both by declaring the
place 6*f Franklin's birth to be in doubt.
or Sunday he will see from the class of
vehicles that it is the middle classes and
not the rich who drive out for pleasure,
and that everybody and all classes ousrnt
to be encouraged to drive out for pleasure,
which not only gives them health but
gives- employment to carriage makers,
horse raisers, stable men, blacksmiths
and all kindred employments. He says it
will take nine millions of dolalrs. The
answer to that is that it is assessed for a
million and a half, and that recent sale 3
indicate its value to be about three mil-
Hon and a half, and four millions would
be a liberal price in which the city would
get the worst of the bargain. Your corre
spondent seems to be purely selfish, and
protests against the "worry, trouble, ex
pense, wear and tear, time and break
age" of moving across the street. Private
convenience must give way to public
rights and benefits. The future of San
Francisco must not be side-tracked be
cause it is too much trouble for your cor
respondent to move out of the way. It is
the Fame kind of a man that for many
years stopped the opening of Van Ness
avenue to the bay; but the public rights
then triumphed and he was. compelled to
move after making himself a conspicuous
nuisance in the community. If San Fran
cisco issued its indebtedness for $54,000,000,
which is the limit, it would be in the
same position as several California towns.
It is only asked now to spend five or ten
millions for park extension, necessary
schools, outfall sewer and the City and
County Hospital. Next year, under the
charter, we will want another issue of
bonds for public utilities. The latter pay
for themselves and are not a burden. The
other things are an expense; but now is
the time to get to work. This land can be
acquired now, and the city is wining *o
pay a fair price for It. This is the city's
opportunity, but it is also the property
owner's opportunity for this reasonâ that
the park panhandle extension between
Fell and Oak streets, once having been
projected, will never down. If it is de
feated this year it may prevail next year;
but in the meantime nobody will buy this
land. The future of the park requires
for its completion and perfection this, ex
tension to Van Ness avenue and Market
street. The property owners must sell to
the city, and they had better make ready
to move where there is such an abun
dance of unoccupied land north and south
of the park. The movement of this popu
lation (there being over two hundred in
dividual owners of land) will make a stir
in the building trades, giving employ
ment to labor, open up outlying territory,
and give the city, as the Art Association
has expressed it, a "worthy approach and
entrance" to the greatest park in the world,
now accessible only by back streets,
around corners, amid dingy surroundings,
and over bad roads, slippery in winter
and corduroy in summer. Respectfully,
FRANK J. FALLON.
He frankly accepted both statements
as correct, and in writing of Boston
said: "Benjamin Franklin was a twins,
having been born in Boston in tyro dif
ferent houses, simultaneously at the
same time."
It will not be too much of a strain
to follow that precedent and humor
Democratic friends by conceding the
validity of the claims of both Jefferson
banquets on the ground that Thomas
Jefferson was a twins, having pro
claimed and supported two opposing
platforms of political principles "sim
ultaneously at the same time."
A short time ago "W. C. Morrow,
doubtless encouraged by the favor with
which his literary work has been re
ceived in the East and in London, de
termined to put his talents and his
fortunes to the supreme test; to cut
loose from the occupation in which he
has been engaged and to devote him
self to the production of literature;
making it not the mere avocation' of
his leisure hours, as in the Â«f>ast, but
his vocation in lifeâ the business that
is to engage his working days and have
the service of all his energies. It has
since been announced that Ambrose
Bierce has determined upon the same
course, and It is to be hoped the re
port is correct. In the noises of busi
ness and politics and the flutter caused
by the miserable wars in the Philip
pines and in Samoa, the actions of
these two quiet literary men will be
almost unnoted, and yet such is the
value of literature it is probable that
foreign nations and future generations
will give more attention to this change
in the nature of their work than to any
other event of the year in California,
Up to this time America has pro
duced but two literary men possessing
sufficient creative power to bring- forth
work having the quality of a primal
elementâ something not built up out of
existing material, but created, as it
were, from the infinite itself and fash
ioned into form by the divinity of orig
inal genius. One of these men, Haw
thorne, was of New England; the other,
Poe, was of the South. Their environ
ments were diverse and the processions
of their lives were in no respect alike;
yet each turned away from the com
monplaces of outward existence to
study the things that are hidden. Each
in his own way revealed the abysses
in which the soul lives and depicted
the grisly terrors and phantoms that
haunt it and fight it there. Their in
fluence has been more profoundly felt
abroad than at home. At the present
time there are but two men in America
who, while not in any respect imitators
carry on the work of Hawthorne and
Poe, and develop still further that liter
ature of the unfathomable abyss which
is originally and distinctively Ameri
can. These are the writers who have
now determined to give themselves
seriously to literary work-Mr. Morrow
and Mr. Bierce. Each has already pro
duced genuine literature of such excel
lence that his new departure can hard
ly be regarded as an adventure. They
but set Bail to the mysterious isles
where they have often voyaged before
The only difference is they now pro
pose to settle there, and the well
plowed fields of journalism are to
know them no more.
W hile I have a genuine admiration
for the genius and the exquisite literary
skill of Hawthorne and of Poe, and also
for the same qualities in the -work of
Mr. Morrow and Mr. Bierce, and some
times indulge the belief that I can ap
preciate them at something near their
true value in the world of letters I
have never had a full sympathy with
their work. I have never been addicted
to the weird. I have never had nor
desired, that penetrating insight which
sees quite through the flesh that rovers
mortality and discerns the skeleton
within. I prefer humanity with the
flesh on and the skin over it. and the
rosier the complexion the better I like
it. Nevertheless whatever may be in
dividual tastes all Californians must
feel something of gratification in the
report that two such artistic writers
are going to make the Production of
high literature the serious work of their
lives. __
When all is said and done nothing
else produced by a community is of
such permanent and precious va.ue as
its literature. It is full time California
were adding more to the world s stock
of this pure gold of the intellect. The
degradation of the American magazine
to advertising has closed that avenue
which was once open to the advance of
true literary workers, and the only way
now for the writer who has an artistic
conscience is to turn to the practice of
the old Grub-street daysâ get himself
to a garret, live on a crust, write dooks
and appeal from the publisher to the
big public. Mr. Morrow and Mr. Bierce
have chosen well and a wide constitu
ency will wait with impatience the
forthcoming of the first fruits of the
new labors of each.
Chinatown is not only corrupt itself
but the cause of corruption in others.
It is something like a municipal vermi
form .appendix, and it might be worth
while to subject the city to a surgical
operation and cut it out. For the whole
week the Examiner has been reiterat
ing the charge "that the sum of not
than $2500 is raised weekly in
Chinatown for the purpose of bribing
the police department to permit the
carrying: on of gambling games and
lotteries." The display of knowledge
of this secret corruption should not
subject our contemporary to unworthy
suspicions of sharing the spoils, for the
very intensity of its language is proof
that it is getting none. Whila the cor
ruption fund is generally known as
hush money, it does anything but hush.
It has been squealing for we?ks like a
baby at the dead of nightâ is deaf to
lullabies and won't take soothing
eyrup.
In all this racket my sympathies ar*Â»
with the police â with both factions of
the policeâ and with any individuals of
the police who may belong to neither
faction and cherish a desire to run both
of them in. In a community so admin
istered as this, what can the police do
to suppress iniquity and fill the city
with sweetness and light? With judges
on the bench who make a jest of law
and turn test cases into comic operas;
with Police Commissioners who if they
do not violate the law are at least re
puted to do so and are certainly not
much above their reputations; and with
angry journals hunting for the n
of depravity in Chinatown and over
looking the haystack of vice all aroun 1
itâ there is hardly anything of genuine
virtue the police could do short of
clubbing everything in sight of the
City Hall and arresting all who protest.
The cause of the fire which burned
the "palatial cottage" of Idle Hour,
where the high contracting parties of
the Vanderbilt-Fair alliance were
spending their honeymoon is reported
to be a mystery. There are some who
think it started by an incendiary burg
lar, and there are some who regard it
as the result of a defect in the heating
apparatus. There is another theory
worth consideration â the building may
have been fired by the happy pair
themselves. It is fairly reasonable to
suppose that a rapturous couple, hav
ing dazzled the world by a display *>f
a million dollar's worth of ostentatious
wedding presents, may have thought it
appropriate to cap the climax by ap
plying the torch to the honeymoon hall
and showing the Astors that the Vaja
derbilts have palaces to burn.
Before public interest in the grand
wedding passes away and is lost from
memory along with the vanishing
smoke from the ruins of Idle Hour, it
is worth noting that while the pregs
gave so much of its energies and its
space for weeks to the gorgeous event
it overlooked one important thing â a
thing so very interesting indeed that its
omission from the pictures of the vari
ous features of the scene can he ac
counted for only upon th<* supposition
that every newspaper in New York Is
guided and managed by a journalistic
paresis club. It was stated that Mrs.
O. H. P. Belmont presented the bride
with a quantity of gold plate blazoned
with the Vanderbilt arms, and yet not
a single journal, yellow or legitimate,
published a picture of the arms to
satisfy the eyes of a gazing world.
There will be more Vanderbilt cere
monies in the future and it is to b<*
hoped that omission will never occur
again.
It Is not easy to understand the mo
tives that have prompted either the
actions or the talk of Governor Gage
of late, for the workings of a mind
like his can be discerned clearly only
by those who are practiced in micro
scopic examination. I think, however,
he was aiming at economy and desired

UNCLE SADLY

ROUTE HOME
His Men Defeated by
Watsonville.
BEATEN OUT BY ONE RUN
A GREAT CONTEST OUT AT REC
REATION PARK.
League Babies Show Themselves to
Be Exceptionally Good in a
Cake-Walk Around
the Bases.
Uncle Hank came back from Watson
ville last Monday, wearing: his hat on the
back of his head in consequence of hav
ing taken two games from the league
babies, and received the plaudits of an
admiring populace with that indifferent
hauteur so befitting a conquering hero,
barely deigning to remark that the locals
would "make more monkeys" of the su
gar crushers when they came here this
week.
Well, Watsonville's contingent came,
and after the game yesterday your uncle
crawled through a knot-hole in the fence
surrounding Recreation Park, and with
his hat jammed well down over his eyes
sadly made his way down town by way
of convenient back alleys, thereby avoid
ing his friends nnd painful explanations.
But uncle ought not to take defeat too
much at heart, especially such a defeat
as yesterday's, for it was a veritable
whirlwind from start to finish, with nice
clean hitting, Bel ding that bordered on
the sensational and few errors, the ones
. being inexpensive, with the cx
i of one in the ninth by Lawler,
which let in Frisco's la,st run and came
near tying the score. Watsonville's hits
portunely, and that tells
the whole story.
Managi r Struve has herded up a rat

In the outfield both made
remarkable plays, but Lawler was
rfctim of some hard luck. He failed
cept two of the four chances offered
him, but they were l>"th difficult, and
besides being on a strange diamond made
some difference with him.
J. Donahue, who has been trifling with
the league magnates beyond further en
durani to report for umpire duty
again yesterday, and Hughey Smith was
p; essed into service. Donahue will be
dropped at the next meeting of the direc
tors and Smith will probably be regularly
appointed. It. would be difficult to make a
r selection, for he is impartial, is
Â«â¢ 'i of excellent judgment on balls
and strike?, and. better than all. is at all
times complete master of the situation, as
obstreperous players know to their finan
cial loss.
It looked at the outset yesterday as
though 'Frisco was going tn tear the cu
â¢r the sphere and win in a walk, for
â  lean triples in the initial
inning savors of plentj more to follow.
But the bombardment did not disconcert
Whelan in the least, and after that their
hits came singly. After Pyne had been
retired on a fly to Flake, Riley ripped out
a three-cushion shot into the far corner
of the fl< '. 1. Krug was assisted out at
first by McCarthy, Riley scoring on the
play. Then Sullivan duplicated Josh's
â  lilderbrandt was retired at first
by Franks and Sully died in his tracks.
Watsonville abstracted a brace of sin
gles in the second, but it was not until
following inning that they scored,
when two runs came in. Franks opened
with a single, stole second and scored on
McCarthy's double. Courtney flew to Sul
livan, McCarthy going to third on the out.
Selna worked a pass, stole second, and
just then Fireman Fitz sent in a wild
pitch that enabled McCarthy to score.
Plake struck out.
'Frisco evened up the score in the fifth,
O'Neil was hit on the elbow by a pitched
ball and stole second. Hartman hit a
grounder along the first-base line, over
took the ball and became tangled up with
it, the umpire very properly calling him
out. Fitzpatrick popped up a fly to Mc-
Carthy and Pyne smashed out a triple,
scoring O'Neil. Riley flew to Lawler.
Watsonville untied the score and won
the game in its half of the same inning.
Franks was given his base, McCarthy fol
lowing with a hit to Fitzpatrick. who made
a futile attempt to force Franks at sec
ond. Courtney s single scored Franks and
placed McCarthy on third, from where he
scored on Selna's fly to Sullivan. Plake
was given his base, but Morrow ended the
inning with a hot one to Fitz, who as
sisted him out at first.
"Frisco made several desperate attempts
to score, but it was not until the ninth
that it succeeded. Muller was given a
pass, but forced at second on O'Nell's hit
to Franks. Hartman singled to right, the
ball getting away from Lawler, and
O'Neil scored. Hartman going to third.
Fitz dropped the ball in front of the plate,
and Hartman foolishly attempted to score,
but was caught between bases and run
down by \Vhelan and Franks. Pyne was
assisted out at first by McCarthy and the
trouble ended with the following result:

SAN JOSE, April 15.â "Clam Juice Lou"
Hardie was the star of the day in the ball
game to-day between Oakland and San
Jose, which the former won by a score of
2 to 1, his three-bagger in the second in
ning scoring Hammond, and was followed
by a score for himself.' Oakland played

Santa Cruz Defeats Sacramento.
SANTA CRUZ. April 15.â A large crowd
witnessed the game between Sacramento
and Santa Cruz to-day. Sacramento lost
through inability to solve Donald's curves
and the heavy batting of the Beachcomb
ers. Santa Cruz made five runs in the
first inning, which the visitors could not
overcome. Not until the eighth did they
have any chance of winning, when they
made five runs. The feature of the game
was Clark's home fun, being the second
he has made off Sacramento this season.
The score was as follows:

To-Day's Game.
Watsonville and San Francisco will
meet again at Recreation Park this af
ternoon, in what promises to be one of the
hottest games ever played here. The
teams are evenly matched in the field and
it promises to be a pitchers' battle from
start to finish. Ham Iberg will make his
season's debut on the local diamond for
the home team, while Harper will be in
the box for the visitors.
There has been a long and heated dis
pute among local fanatics over the rela
tive merits of the two men, and as this is
the first time they have opposed each oth
er with anywhere near even support there
will be a big crowd out to witness the
struggle. The makeup of the teams is as
follows:

GILROY HOT SPRINGS.
Change of Management.
R. Robertson, who for the last five
years conducted Paraiso Springs, has
taken a long lease of the famous Gilroy
Hot Springs.
This is of the greatest advantage to
the latter place as it will mean com
petent management, a bountiful table
and the beautifying and brightening up
as well as modernizing and restoring
tii their previous popularity this old
time favorite resort.
With many natural attractions, its
unequaled hot spring's and mineral
waters, its picturesque location and
availability to San Francisco, combined
with Mr. Robertson's contemplated im
provements they cannot fail to become
popular. Rest, recreation, health,
amusement and a good time are as
sured every visitor to Gilroy Hot
Springs.
The Americus.
San Francisco Council of the Order of
Amerleus at its last held meeting- inau
gurated a system of entertainments to
follow routine work after each meeting,
commencing at it o'clock. There was a
piano recital by C. H. Leech, an interest
ing paper by ''harks J. King, selections
by the Americus quartet and an address
on "The Privilege of American Citizen
ship" by James Taylor Rogers.
Any Lump in a Woman's Breast Is
Cancer.
Dr. Chamley, at 25 Third street, has
just published a 120-page book on can
cers and tumors cured without knif^
or pain which he sends free. The book
contains about three hundred testi
monials from prominent people cured
in and around San Francisco. In this
book he says "no pay until cured," and
says "any lump in a woman's breast
is cancer." Cet the book, read it, and
then send it to some one with cancer.*
The Supreme Court Travels.
The Justices of the Supreme Court have
gone to Los Angeles to hold the April
term, which will last two weeks. On
M;iy 1 the court will reconvene in this
city for "motion day." The Justices will
then go to Sacramento, where they will
hold court for one week, beginning about
May 8.
IS STARVING AND
SICK UNTO DEATH
IN a stuffy little attic bedroom at. 359 Minna street Mrs. L. Ress lies sick
unto death. The woman is entirely destitute. She lacks food and she
lacks clothing, besides being in arrears for several months' rent of the
miserable little hole she calls home.
Mrs. Ress is suffering from a complication orf diseases, aggravated by
the want of proper care and nourishment. Her little 14-year-old daughter
is her only attendant. Dr. Dillon, who has his office at the corner of Fourth
and HaiTison streets, has kindly taken charge of the poor, sick woman and
is giving gratis not only his services but the necessary medicines.
During the past week Mrs. Ress and her little one have managed to live
on 60 cents that was donated by a tender hearted boy in the neighborhood.
Minna street is not the locality where moneyed people make their homes,
and the neighbors of the Resses find it all that they can do to provide for
their own immediate wants.
Mrs. Ress needs good nourishing food and the dainty tid-blts that are as
necessary as medicine for the sick. She needs bedclothlng and blankets,
clothes for herself and daughter and good substantial food for the child.
A woman in Mrs. Ress' condition has not much time to wait, and so the
many kind hearted ones who are going to attend to her case want to at
tend to it quickly.
PLAYED GOLF IN
A STIFF BREEZE
PRESIDIO TEAM NINE UP ON
YESTERDAY'S GAME.
Tie Between Oakland and San Fran
cisco Will Be Decided Next
Month at San Rafael or
Burlingame.
The second half of the home-and-home
match between teams of eight represent
ing the San Francisco and Oakland golf
clubs was played yesterday afternoon on
| the Presidio links and ended in a victory
! for the home eight by nine holes. The
Oakland team, however, being 2S up on
the first half of the match, which was
played on Saturday, April 8, on the Adams
Point links, and it having been agreed
that the scores of the two halves should
I be added together, Oakland won the sec
ond match with a score of 20 up. The San
Francisco club having won the first double
match, played at Oakland December 10,
and at the Presidio Decemer 17, of last
year, each club has won one double
match, and the total result is a tie. which
will be played off next month either at
Burlingame or on the links of the San
Rafael Golf Club.
The composition of both teams and the
rank of the players had undergone some
change since April 8, A. B. Williamson
and H. B. Goodwin taking the placos of
Dr. C. T. Hlbbetta and R. H. Gaylord In
the San Francisco eight, and W. P. John
son playing in the Oakland team Instead
of C. P. Hubbard. WMen the first pair of
opponents, E. R. Folger of Oakland and
1 S. L. Abbott Jr. of San Francisco drove
off from the first teeing ground a stiff
westerly breeze was blowing right across
the links, making straight driving a mat
ter of much difficulty and some luck. In
the first round the home team scored 11
boles, and the visitors 10, leaving San
I Francisco I up. In the second round the
! home team scored 11 against the visitors'
3, making San Francisco 8 up. In both
rounds San Francisco was 9 up. but as
Oakland was 2\* up on the previou
urday's play the entire watch ended In
favor df Oakland with a score of 20 up.
The visitors brought over their own cad
dies, who were smartly attired in bright
green caps and white sweaters with the
letters O. â¢:. C. In preen upon the breast.
The San Francisco men did not have the
full advantage yesterday of a home team
playing on its own links, for the new
course, holes and putting greens were
almost as strange to them as to the visi
tors. Several of the players employed
fore caddies to note the spot where the
ball stopped. Among the visitors R. A.
Cooke and J. C. McKee made good and
straight drives, and the latter played
some fine approach shots. A few visitors
were at the links, but hardly any except
the. players, scorers and caddies braved
the chill strong breeze which swept over
; the course. The score of each player in
I both rounds Is shown in the table:

THE British bark Zinita, from Antwerp for San Francisco, had a hard time of it off Cape Horn. She
was caught in a terrific storm and for forty-eight hours lay on her lee side, with the water up to her
main hatchway. Sails were blown from the boltropes, cabin and forecastle flooded, and everytnlnff
movable on deck washed away. Oil bags put over the side finally kept the seas from breaking inboard and
saved the vessel from further damage.

ler, who has a smooth lace and Is fat and
sleek as any Chinaman, was dressed in
the native costume complete from shoes
to pigtail and started to make the rounds.
He was closely followed by Officers Bon
ner, King and Taylor. The quartet lirst
went through Waverjy place, but the
lights there are so bright that the look
outs readily penetrated Butler's disguise
and refused to open the doors. The next
place visited was Ross alley, narrow,
dark and foul-smelling. Butler walked up
to the door of the Pacific Coast Friendly
Society and gave the customary rap. Af
ter a moment's hesitation the lookout
pulled the string and admitted him. He
walked boldly over-to the table, seized the
dealer by the back of the neck and threw
him into a corner, and coolly began gath
ering up everything in sight. Before the
playi :s had recovered from the tlrst shock
of surprise the blows of axes were heard
on the outer door and they realized thut
they were caught. Fifteen were speedily
bundled into a patrol wagon and tak< n to
the California-street police station, where
they were charged with visiting a fantan
game. The lookout who admitted But
ier was the most crestfallen man in the
whole outfit. As he leaned up against
the desk in the police station surv. ying
tin- pseudo chinaman be said: "When I
,ook at you head 1 thinkee slomthin
wlong; when r look at you shoe 1 think
alle lighten and pull stiing."
Lieutenant Price has in years gone by
frequently captured gamblers in this
manner, but the Chinese became so wary
that it was abandoned. Enough time has
elapsed for them to forget the trick, hence
the success of last night's raid.
SAILORS' WAGES MAY
BE SFI7ED FOR DEBT
JURISDICTION OP STATE COURTS
DEFINED.
Decision by Judge de HavÂ«n of In
terest to Seamen and Their Cred
itors Afloat and Ashore.
United States District Judge de Haven
yesterday handed down a decision which
will prove of much interest to the men
who go down to the sea in ships. The
case is a libel brought by \V. Gilray
against the steamer Queen to recover
wages which had been attached under
execution issued by a State court.
The opinion goes on to pay that the
maritime law does not recognize any
right to attach the wages of a seaman in
an action at law instituted by his cred
itors in a State court. It had been held
in otber cases that the fact that the wages
of a mariner were under attachment in a
â¢ding- at law pending in a State
court would not suspend or defeat the
right of the mariner to proceed in admi
ralty for the recovery of his wages.
There is. however, a marked difference
between an attachment to secure pay
ment of an asserted, and, it may be, dis
puted and unfounded claim, and the levy â 
of an execution which simply seizes upon
property of a debtor for the purpose of
satisfying a valid judgment, the decision
goes on to say, but no authority had been
quoted to show that the wages of a sea
man may not. when no suit to recover the
same Is pending in a court of admiralty,
be taken on execution issued out of "a
State court in the absence of a statute
exempting them from seizure, or in which
it is held that the prior payment of the
amount due a seaman for wages in satis
faction of an execution issued against
him, would not constitute a good defense
to a subsequent action brought by him
in admiralty for the recovery of such
wapes. â : â¢ â¢â "â ;..
The libel was,, therefore, ordered dis
missed.
WANTS HER PUNISHED.
Attorney Pistolesi Swears to. a War-
rant for Mrs. Traver's Arrest.
Attorney Pistolesl appeared before
Judge Graham yesterday and swore to
a warrant for the arrest of Mrs. J. J.
Traver, the woman who slapped his face
In tho corridor of the new City Hall on
Friday afternoon, as was exclusively
stated in The Call. Mr. Pistolesl does not
Intend to rest until the sting of the
blows he received is smoothed by seeing
his nemesis severely dealt with by the
court.
On the other hand, the lady who did the
slapping is proud of her work and feels
confident that she will not be punished
for acting as she did. She reiterated yes
terday that she does not use face powder,
and if any one ever asserts that she
does he would better look out.
Up to a late hour last night the war
rant was not served. According to the
officer In whose hands It' was given, he
cannot arrest the lady until she is ident
ified by Attorney Pistolesl. As the lat
ter has some compunction about entering
Mrs. Traver's castle, even though ac
companied by a minion of the law, it la
believed he will let the matter drop.

DIVINE HEALING.
PMNMYED
FROM DEATH BY
HEALER TROTH
A Sufferer From Appen-
dicitis, Her Life Was
Despaired Of,
In the Crucial Hour Healer Truth
Was Appealed To and She
Was Permanently Cured.
REMARKABLE CURES EFFECTED
Well-Known Society Woman Relieved of
the Arsenic-Eating Habit â Chronic
Diseases Successfully Treated
at 440 Geary Street.
A remarkable cure of appendicitis,
from which a well-known society wo-
man of Sari Francisco had been auffor-
| ing for many months, was effected by
Healer Francis Truth at 440 Geary
street' last week.
At the earnest request of the lady in
question, as well as her relatives, her
name is withheld from publication.
Healer "A-uth will, on personal applica-
tion, divulge it to any person or persons
desirous of ascertaining the facts.
The case in question was a peculiar
one. It baffled the best medical practi-
tioners in the city, who said no cure
could be effected without a surgical
operation. The physical condition of
the patient was such as to render her
survival almost an impossibility. Yet
drastic measures were necessary; death
confronted her in any event and the
operation was decided upon.
A day or two before the sufferer was
to undergo the trying ordeal, which
seemed inevitable death to her, her at-
tention was attracted to the remarka-
ble cures of chronic diseases effected
by Healer Francis Truth. Was it worth
while to try his methods? It could do
no harm, and, assured of secrecy, no
matter what the outcome, she entrusted
her case to Healer Truth's cere.
The result was marvelous. For weeks
a sufferer of the keenest agony from
fever caused by an excessive Inflamma-
tion of the vermiform appendix, she
was at the first visit greatly relieved.
On the following day her fever was
allayed and on the third it had disap-
peared entirely. In less than four days
every vestige of the disease had van-
ished and the woman is now thoroughly
cured. Her family physician was
amazed at the cure of his patient and
ihe could scarcely credit it. He is now
j convinced, however, that her cure is
I not only genuine but permanent.
In the list of Healer Truth's wonder-
ful restorations to health and vigor are
many others equally remarkable as the
one alluded to. The press have from
time to time mentioned them and the
accounts have served to bring his work
prominently before the public. From
all parts of the country come letters of
j inquiry addressed not only to Healer
j Truth himself but to his hundreds of
j patients, asking for information con-
| cerning his methods. The result is a
huge correspondence by which the be-
neficent influence of" the Healer becomes
wider from day to day and his sphere
of usefulness greatly enlarged.
Among the special cures effected this
week may be mentioned the following:
Two cases of sciatica of long standing ]
.which were deemed impossible of cure J
until Healer Truth was appealed to. j
Several cases of female weakness of
many years' standing. One of these
women was for months scarcely able to j
walk and then only with the most ex-
I cruciatlng suffering. She was cured by
three treatments. Another cure was
that of a confirmed arsenic-eater, a
woman who moves In high social cir-
cles. Her case was considered hope-
less, and Healer Truth was offered $1000
if he accomplished a cure. This was j
done In less than two weeks and the
money paid. Since that time the grat-
ified woman has shown an abhorrence
for arsenic which indicates that her
cure will be permanent.
The absent cases of Healer Truth are
equally remarkable. Several hundred
victims of chronic diseases living in I
various parts of the Union have abund-
ant Reason to bless the fate that cast
them in Healer Truth's path. Inquiries
are always cheerfully answered and all j
communications are confidentially
treated.

HARBOR'S FATE UNDECIDED
GOVERNMENT ENGINEERS WILL
SOON DETERMINE IT.
San Francisco Merchants Recognize
the Vast Importance of the En
terprise and Urge Favor
able Action.
The question as to whether or not an
appropriation Is to be madÂ« for the im
provement of tho entrance to Yaquina
| Bay, In Oregon, to be carried on in ac
*â  cordance with the, authorization of Con
gress, is agitating the people not only of
Southern Oregon; but of this city.
In 1695 Congress passed a bill providing
for the promotion of the work on the con
tinuous contract basis and author::- the
appropriation of $1,000,000 for the purpose.
Tho lu-st Congress "held up" the appro
priation and provided for the appointment
ot a bourd of engineers to examine the
harbor and report Anally on the proposed
Improvement.' The interesting part of the :
situation is the fact that if the board
makes an adverse report there will be a
Jong and costly delay in reviving the en-
Iterprise.
San Francisco's interest in the matter
Jies la the fact that Yaquina Bay Is the
liey to the great import and export busi
nt ss of the southern part of the Willam
ette Valley and the wealth-producing
Â£i Ms of Eastern Oregon: The bay in ques
ttbn is the natural outlet of that section
u::il this city is entitled to the trade. On
the other hand the interest of the mer
chants of Portland and the Congressmen
controlled by that enÂ«l of the State is to
the further improvement of the
Lay in order that all the tralllc from the i
southern par; of the State all go over !
the line of the Southern Pacific and bo
fcundled in the entrepot of the ...
State. Under these circumstances the
embarrassing situation of the Oregon del
ti,'ation in Congress accounts for the fail
x..'. of the appropriation^
The LJoaru of Government Engineers
Will meet in a few weeks and an effort is
to be made to impress them with the im
portance of the work they have in hand. ,
To this end the Hoard of Trade of this
city met yesterday and adopted resolu-
setting forth the case from the
standpoint of all concerned. It Is stated
tnat the other kindred organizations of
the city will take up the matter on the
Xirst of the week and take similar action.
An open letter, written by the manager
ol the Corvalhs and Eastern Railroad,
which runs eastward from Yaquina Bay,
fairly illustrates the situation as shown
l>y the following extracts:
In order that you may fully under
stand this matter I will say that on
May 11, ISOS, a board of engineers,
consisting of Lieutenant Colonel Amos
Stlckney; Major James C. Post and
Major Clinton B. Sears, met at Ya
Â«4Ulna and made a report which re
sulted in Congress taking the matter
up under the continuous contract sys
.tem ajid that a law was passed au
thorizing the expenditure of $1,000,000
for the completion of this work, which
in addition to that already on hand
made $1,025,00\i to be expended under
the continuous contract system. The
matter has dragged along since then
until the Government advertised for
bids, which were opened In October
last, and the contract awarded to Chi
cago parties, who subsequently gave
the necessary bonds, signed the con
tract, etc, and $150,u00 .was asked for
as the appropriation for the ensuing
year. * â¦ The measure was defeat
ed and Yaquina entirely left out of
the appropriations for this year. The
chairman of the River and Harbor
Committee made a statement, 1 be
lieve, that the work was not necessary,
and he 1 also endeavored to have the
laws governing it repealed. It was
linally left to tae decision of the board
of engineers which had been appoint
ed. .he trouble in a measure seems to
have boen the small amount of busi
ness that has been done through the
ulna Custom-house for the past
few years. This is susceptible of very
t-asv" explanation.
\\ hen this road was purchased In
lff'4 1 found the steamer Homer on the
r^ute, running in connection with the
, railroad, and doing quite an extensive
business. The owners of this property
deslred to put on a better steamer or
steamers, but owing to the uncertainty
of the Government improving the har
bor they concluded it would be better
for the time being to make trafllc
{â .sfreements with small steamer lines
until such time as it could be deter
mined what class of vessels would be
best puited for the trafllc and the har
bor. Tho Homer was eventually pulled
off the route and the steamer Farallon
substituted. The Farallon, while she
was speedy, could not carry over 500
tons and was as expensive as a vessel
rarryiner 1000 tons. During the time
Fh<j was on the route we were very
<iften blocked with southbound freight,
having frequently over 100 loaded car 3
on the track more than she could take.
Our contract with the Farallon peo
ple did not contemplate so large a vol
ume of business, and as there was very
little money for them in operating this
class of vessel they did not care to put
on more vessels of the same class. Ow
ing to their not being able to handle
the business promptly a great deal of
dissatisfaction was created among the
San Francisco shippers on account of
the delay occasioned by their grain
a i.<l flour remaining on our tracks from
thirty to sixty flays fore the Far
allon rould take it out. This condition
of affairs existed until the Alaska ex
citement, when the Farallon was with
drawn and placed on the Alaska route,
and the steamer Truckee endeavored
to take care of the business. As you
know, she was sunk after a few voy- .
agr-s, and the- railroad company then
chartered the President for a limited
X time, which was the only vessel that
rould possibly be had owing to the de
mand for all classes of sea-going craft
for the Alaska business. She made a
few voyages, but finally broke her
shaft and was withdrawn, leaving us
without any .--â¢â !- of any kind on the
. ocfan and a large quantity of grain at
POSTUM CEREAL.

A DAY or so before Henry Clay riar
nabee of the Bostonians started on
the road this season. Mrs. Ban
extracted from him a promii
ho would refrain from poker. She
pointed out the fact that the hot end of
that article had burned large holes in his
pockets during previous tours, and told
him that it should point ,a moral. He ac
kn iwledged the correctness of his wife's
observations and solemnly gave his word
that ho would have no more of it.
The comedian reckoned without taking
into consideration tho sporting blood In
his veins, or the indubitable evidence of
danger in his own name. The sh
study of comparative nomenclature would
have satisfied him that his promise was
futile. He admits that he is des. â 
from a long line of ancestors, some of
them extending hack to the days when
there were no director}' men to compel
Yaquina destined for San Francisco,
which we were obliged to haul back to
Albany and ship all rail in order to
carry out the provisions of our bills of
lading.
From that time until last September

the only I fame her.' that

out of Yaquina promptly.
What 1 wish to lmpr< ss upon you Is
the fact that had the Government
on with this work and ena
owners of this road to determine on
the class of vessels that v uit
able. for this route, they would have
been built and operated. Further, the
rests <">f San Francisco in Keeping

ley Further, the extension of the road
tward to the Inland empire of East

thls harbor Is Improved as con
templated and promised, it is ques
tionable in my mind whether the own

If San Francisco d< I trade of

more natural, although he spells the sylla

remote progenitor wrote Bar-na-by. Still
further on another undoubtedly wrote
Bar-no-by, and some other In the misty
ages when they fought be.tter than they
spelled had it Bar-no-bo-dy. Most nat
ural conclusion in the world.
That this is the true derivation of thÂ«
name no sane person can doubt who has
the comedian sit into a game of
poker. Therefore, -with the blood of the
Bar Nobody of the ages in his veins, is it
any wonder that a childlike comfillan like
Barnabee should fall? It. is nothing more
nor less than atavism. He could not help
It, especially when the tempter came In
the person of VTilliam Broderick, the ro
bust basso of the company, -who looks,
but la not, the easiest mark that ever
came over the pike.
The fall came on Sunday at .the end of
the fifth week of tho present tour, while
the company was being whirled over the
rails to the next stand. All the new
stories and most of tho old ones had been
retold for the purpose of whillng away
the hours and things were getting mo
notonous. Brodorick, who was a now man
in thr l>ostonians, had a leaning to poker,
and know Barnabee's fondness fnr the
frame. He was aware also, of the promise
given by the comedian,' and while ho
fairly noho<! to get Barnabee into a game,
his native modi sty- he is suspected of
having had his origin In Chicago â pre
v< nt ill him from making the lirst ad
vance. The terrible dullness of that Sun
day, however, was too much for him, and
he decld-ed to break the ice.
â¢'Join us In a little game?" ho asked
Barnabee, after having consulted with
several other members of the pnrty.
"Will I?" exclaimed the comedian,
Jumping up from his chair near his wife's.
"Watch me!"
"Barney!" exclaimed Mrs. Barnabee,
Li hfully, "your promise!"
"Oh, 1 know all about that. I'm not cro
lne: to break it. I'll just sit in and give
young fellows a lesson and cure
them forever of tempting their Uncle Bar
ney into a game."
H.< was fully satisfied that Broderick
was the easy mark ho took him for. nnd
his face waa wreathed with smiles as he
sat in with the basso and two others. He
patted the cards lovingly as he made the
first cut, and when it came to his turn to
deal he wanted to be so good that he
dealt extra pasteboards to everybody at
the tab. .
"Here," paid Broderick. "Misdeal. I've
pot one card too many. Pass the deal!"
"Not much, William,"- replied tho
dealer. "1 gave you too many just to see
if you knew anything at all about the
game."
Tlie poor opinion of Broderick's ability
as a xpressed by this remark
seemed to be borne out from the very
start. Tho ill luck that proverbially at
t' nds the pi fa frame fastened on
Broderick, and the best he could get was
the worst of it, greatly to the delipht of
T-tarnabee, who was raking in most of the
money, the other players being content to
fill in and watch the others duel.
"These lessons are expensive, William,"
remarked Barnabee in his blandest tones
as he raked in a jackpot containing six
or seven of Broderick's dollars. "They
come hiph, but us young fellows must
have them."
HISTORY AND
MIT BEAUTIFUL
IN COMBINATION
Realistic Panorama of
Battle of Manila.
PERFECTION IN DETAIL
ENTERTAINMENT APPEALS TO
ALL AMERICANS.
Central Park the Scene of a Great Sea
Fight That Borders So Closely
on Realism as to Almost
Deceive.
An entertainment of historic and artistic '
Interest was opened by the Interstate i
Panorama Company for the people of San
Francisco yesterday in the Panorama of
Manila Bay at Central Park. A private \
view was given in tho early part of the J
afternoon, and later the generaJ public
was admitted. It is safe to say that |
every one who saw it derived from the j
picture not only a clearer idea of the
great sea fight, but the genuine pleasure
that always comes from the contempla
tion of good work well done in the crea
tion of ideals of beauty.
This panorama Is more attractive than
any former battle picture, inasmuch as
the scene itself is one of picturesque and
romantic loveliness. The earth ha-s few
combinations of sea and shore more fair
than that which makes up the wide bay
of Muniia and the little harbor of Cavite,
and at the time of the battle the view was
presented under Its divinest aspect. Jt
was early morningâ the hour when land
and sea are freshest anfl fairest. Misty
vnpors floated about the sky, the distant
shores presented a varied view through
the hazy air and every wave gleamed in
tints of emerald and pearl.
The panorama is presented from a point,
of view just opposite Cavite and along the
line taken by the American warships as
they steamed back and forth during the
fight. The time is the moment when
Dowey gives the signal to close up. The
answering signal la displayed on each
ship. The American 'fleet is near the
spectator, who stands, as it were, in the
midst of it. On* one side, not far away,
are seen the Spanish fleet and the town
and harbor of Cavite. On the opposite
side, far off and dim in the distance, are
the merchant vessels and foreign ships
in the bay, and beyond them, out of a
mass of buildings, clear in the sunlight,
rise the towers of Manila.
Beautiful ns is the background of the
scene, the center of Interest is of course
the battle itself. The great ship Olympla
holds the foremost place. Her massive
prow is so near the spectator that he can
almost touch it with outstretched hand.
It is the largest representation of a ship
ever presented In a panorama, and Its
creation Is one of the supremest triumphs
of the art of illusion. Not all of it is on
canvas. Much of the body of the ship and
I line "f the gun turrets and guns are pro
jections from the picture, but it will puzzle
the acutest observr-r to determine where
the realism 1 ends and the illusion or art
begins. â  " ,* , .â

And so the pame proceeded for an hour,
Broderick's ill-luck costing in that time
between thirty and forty dollars, which
were tantallzlngly stacked in front of the
comedian. The basso felt sore, not so
much at the loss of his coin as at the
gentle guying he was getting- at tne
tongue of his opponent. No man can
stand even the most good-natured reflec
tions on his ability as a poker-player, and
Broderick was no exception. He felt so
.! -.Mi on his luck that he threw up his
hand and got another member of the
company to play his money for him. He
left the car for a few minutes and re
turned with a pocket Hoyle he had man
aged to borrow, the reason for which be
came apparent In a short time.
Taking a seat near tho players Brod
erick awaited the chance that he knew
was bound to come. Barnabee had a
fashion of appealing to the rules on all
occasions, and, in the absence of a book,
took offhand liberties in their interpreta
tion. In consequence he was In constant
friendly dispute with his opponents, es
pecially when he was losing, as he began
to do immediately Broderick's substitute
sat in. The tide had turned against him
and in a short time the substitute had
won back nearly all the basso had lost,
confirming Barnahee In his first Impres
sion that Broderick was easy game. He
had a yearning that the principal might
replace the substitute, and he made slur
ring r< marks intended to rouse up the
sporting blood of the basso.
â¢'You're a nice poker player," said, "to
quit .iust because you were losing a few
dollars. I sat down to play with you and
you got out. I insist that you play your
own hand."
Kroderick hesitated long enough to
deepen the impression that he was a
â¢â mark' and then replaced the substitute.
Two hands had not been dealt till Bar
nabee appealed to the rules on a differ
ence of opinion as to the strength of two
hands. He began his own interpretation,
only to be cut short when Broderick
pulled the Hoyle.
"1 thought you miirht want to learn the
rudiments of the game," said the basso,
"so i dug up this."
Barnabee laid down his hand nnd eager
ly turned the leaves, confident that his In
terpretation of the rule he had sought to
quote would he borne out by the great
American authority. It was not. Hoyle
was against him, and that did not help
his state of mind. He yielded, however,
as gracefully as a man can who sees the
fellow raklns In the shekels and
buckled to to retrieve his fallen fortunes.
Luck would not change for Barnabee-.
As they played on, Broderick Increased
his winnings with every deal, mostly from
Barnabee, who, be it known, plays too lib
erally ever to cart away much money.
The disputes which the basso contrived
were frequent and so were Barnabee's ap
to the rules, which, three times out
of four, floored him. He fumed inwardly
and fretted outwardly and g r >t himself
Into such a state of mind that he was not
sine he waa playing poker or was the
"fall guy" in a big mitt trfime. He played
worse and worse, and finally quit, thirty
odd dollars to the bad, most of It In the
possession of "that soft mark, Bill Brod
erick."
The comedian was soro for several days
after the experience, but he gradually
comforted himself in the knowledge that
he had smashed his non-poker playing
ning tower is seen the admiral. His offi
cers are stationed at various points of
vantage and some of the gunners are seen
busy working the upper guns. Several of
the other ships are near enough for offi
cers and men to be distinguished upon
their decks. The pictures of the officers
are in every case portraits. Here and
there are seen evidenci of the few Span
ish shots that struck our vessels.
Ver different Is the aspect presented
by the Spanish fleet. There are the dis
aster and destruction wrought by the
American suns, and there also is to bo
seen the one action of the bat.tle which
saved the honor of Spainâ the heroic cour
age of the Spanish commander, who when
bis flagship was sinking and in ilames
rowed bravely across the sea exposed to
the American lire to carry his flag to
anothei ship and continue the flght.
In the construction and the painting of
the panorama every care was taken to i
make it a true representation of the ac- j
tual scene. It has been treated artistic- i
ally, but art has been kept strictly within I
the limits of nature and of history- The
scene In the picture, is the scene as it was
on that bright morning of victory. Noth
ing has been exaggerated to produce sen- |
sational effects, nor anything omitted for
the purpose of simplifying the work of
the artists. It is a vivid, realistic pre
sentation of the light which has made a
new epoch in our history, raised a new is
sue of policy in our statecraft, and which
in its results may prove the most impor
tnnt battle fought in the world . since
Waterloo.
For the purpose of preparing the pano
rama Pierre N. Boeringer went as special
artist and commissioner to Manila, made
a number of elaborate water colors of
the landscape and took a series of pho
tographs covering the whole sweep
around the bay. From these views and j
sketches the psmorama was painted main- !
ly by August Lohr and Franz Blberstein j
of Munich, F. W. Heine of Dresden and
George Pejter of Vienna. Those artists
are among' the most eminent in their pro
fession and have already won high repute
for similar work in the artistic capitals
of Europe. Much of the success of the
marine portion of the panorama Is due to
W. A. Coulter, the well known marine ar
tist of Tho Call, who gavo valuable ad
vice in the accomplishment of some of
the technical difficulties of the drawing i
of ships, and to the officers of the Union
Iron Works, who, being builders of the
Olympla, "assisted by furnishing plans of
that model ship.
The artists had the further advantage !
during their work of frequent consulta
tions with naval officers who were present
at the battle. All the officers of the Mc-
Culloch aided in making the design cor
rect by their criticisms and by informa
tion freely given and among others who
have been equally helpful are Captain,
Frank Wildes of the Boston and Lieuten
ant C. Calkins, who was navigator of the
Olympia during the engagement, and Sol |
Sheridan, the war correspondent of The
Call.
William Wehne.r, to whose patriotic-ar
dor and business energy the construction
of the panorama is due, has had much |
experience in designing and carrying out i
such exhibitions. His work Is well known
not only on this coast, where he exhibited
the panorama of Waterloo, several' years
ago. but also in the East, where he ar
ranged a number of panoramas, all of
which were notable for historic accuracy
as well as for artistic effect.
Having acquired a competency through
the success of these enterprises Mr. Weh
ner some years ago removed from Chi
cago and settled In Santa Clara County,
where he has one of the most picturesque
estates in America. Situated on a slope
of the coast range mountains and over
looking the wide sweep of the fertile val- |
ley, the home is surrounded by orchards
and vineyards and backed by olive groves i
along the steep sides of the higher hills, j
Mr. Wahner's success as a vineyardist has
been such that he had no inclination to
return to his former business until the
victory of Manila roused him by the pre
sentation of a subject for a panorama
which would be at once patriotic' and
beautiful. Under the inspiration of the
thought he turned at once from agricul
ture to art. from the plow to panorama
making. Within a week after the news
of the great battle his plans were formu
lated and the work of collecting material
begun. â  '
The panorama Is now open to the public.
It represents the highest achievement
thus far in work of the kind. All that
experience in the construction of former
panoramas taught Mr. Wehner lor his
artists has been applied to make this ven
ture the crowning accomplishment of
panoramic art. It carries illusion to per
fection. The whole wide sweep of the

express permission of Mrs. Barnabee and
the further conviction that Broderick was
such a tyro at the game that he could not
help winning. The luck of the beginner
has passed into an axiom, and Barnabee
made up his mind that he would get even
later. Since that time the comedian has
bet n "poking" steadily among the mem
bers of the company, with the result, un
less a remarkable run of luck sets in, that
he will have to write at the end of this,
as he has at the close of every previous
season, endless checks for I O I"s, which
pass current in the Bostonian continuous
poker game for coin of the realm.

ROAD WORK BOOMING.
The Valley Line to Stockton Rapidly
Nearing Completion.
The Valley road, from Point Richmond
to Stockton] Is a scene of activity all
along the line and It will not be many
more months before the Santa Fe'a termi
nal is finished and ready for business.
The big Franklin tunnel through the
mountains abovo Port Costa will be com
pleted by July 1, or near that time. The
east end is in 2224 feet and the west end
2400. and only 934 feet remain between
heads.
From the west end to Pinole fully 80
per cent of the work is finished, with the
exception of two points. One of these is
the 1100-foot tunnel, of which there yet
remains 200 feet to put through. . From
Pinole to Point Richmond the work has
been opened up at all of the most diffi
cult points, and the contractors are
about to begin on the 80U-foot tunnel at
the point.
The; piers for the big drawbridge over
the San Joaquln River are being put up,
and the grade Is completed between
Stockton and the river. On the unre
claimed land west of the river dredgers
are at work throwing up the 12-foot bank
that will be necessary to raise the road
bod above the level of the levees. The
bank is practically completed for four
miles, and Is also completed from Old
River westward from the end of the
marshes. From there to Antloch, eleven
miles, the grading is completed and ready
for the track. The bridge across Middle
and Old rivers and the viaduct across Al
hambra Valley have not yet been begun,
but will be shortly. The heavy grading
over the Coast range and the. 1100-foot
tunnel on the way are completed, and
Chief Engineer Story is confident that the
greatest of his difficulties have been sur
mounted.

WHAT STATISTICS
HAVE PROVEN!
What Medical Science Has Accomplished.
THIS GREAT DISCOVERY IS OFFERED FREE
TO "CALL" READERS.
Statistics prove that more people are
brought to the grave by diseases of the
kidneys and bladder than by any other
disease.
Kidney trouble is in itself so Insidlou3
and deceptive that thousands have
some form of it and never suspect it.
For many years medical science has
been trying to discover some remedy
that would positively overcome these
dangerous troubles.
But not until recently was the dis-
covery made. Dr. Kilmer, the eminent
physician and scientist, after years of
study and research, and after test on
test that never varied In the grand
result, announced the discovery of
Swamp-Root, which has proven itself
a most wonderful cure for all diseases
of the kidneys and bladder.
' While Swamp-Root has proved such
a remarkable success in curing kidney
and bladder diseases, it has also proved
equally invaluable in the cure of blood
diseases, rheumatism, liver and stom-
ach troubles and in the regulation and
cure of all uric acid troubles.
Swamp-Root has been tested in so
many ways, in hospital work, In private
practice, among the helpless, too poor
to purchase relief, and has proved so
successful in every case that -a special
arrangement has been made by which
all readers of the Call who have not
already tried it, may have a free sam-
ple bottle of Swamp-Root and thus test
for themselves its wonderful curative
properties.
If you will send your name and full
address to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Bing-
hamton, N. V., a sample bottle will be
sent, absolutely free by mail, post-paid,
also a book telling more about Swamp-
Root and containing some of the thou-
sands upon thousands of testimonial
letters received from people who owe
their good health, in fact, their very
lives, to the wonderful curative prop-
erties of Swamp-Root.
This great modern discovery is for
sale at most drugstores in fifty-cent
and one-dollar sizes. Don't make any
mistake, but make a note of the name,
SWAMP-ROOT, Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-
Root, and remember that it is prepared

McDermott went on Friday to Em
eryville, where Corrlgan, by the cour
tesy of his associate gamblers, is ply
ing his trade. The touting tipsters of
the bookmaker urged the old man to
wager his money on a certain horse.
The old fellow knew nothing of the
game. He was a stranger to the
tricks by which the agents of the gam
blers fleece their victims. He needed
money, because money meant his life.
He was persuaded to bet on a cer
tain horse with the assurance that
the animal would win. The old man
bet all he possessed on the race. The
pool-ticket which he placed In his
pocket represented his life. He had
literally staked his existence on a
horserace, and it was Corrigan's privi
lege to decide the bet.
Some of the track gamblers had no
tlced the nervous eagerness with
which the old man made his wager.
They did not know that the old team
slip will not be able to pet away at that
time, as the last three sections of the
Twenty-first Infantry, which has been
assigned t>> sail on her, will not arrive
hetc from Plattsburg, N. V., until late
to-morrow afternoon. The first section
of the regiment is expected this morn-
Ing- All four sections of the regiment
would have arrived at the same time
but for a mlx-up that occurred east of
Omaha in which the big trains used in
its transportation were delayed. The
Hancock will also carry one battalion of
marines to re-enforce Dewey's i'.eet in
Manila Bay.
The Warren is due to sail on the day
following, the 18th, and eight batteries of
thp Sixth Artillery have been assigned to
her, as well as one battery of light ar
tillery. The batteries of the Sixth left
Richmond. Va. . Friday morning.
The 20th has been set as the day of sail
ing for the Newport, which will carry
two light batteries of artillery, and. It is
said, the cash for the payrolls for the
men on the other side. The Hancock and
Warren were both put on the dock when
they arrived here and their bottoms
painted, and are now coaling and taking
on quartermaster's supplies. The N< w
port is also taking on fuel and getting
ready for her trip. All three ship
in splendid condition, and their officers
look for n fair voyage into the tropics.
No day has yet been set for the sailing
of th.-- transport Morgan City, and it is
likely she will be held until the arrival
of the n-Ft of the transport fleet now on
the way from the Philippines. Artillery
and infantry are being hurried to this
city 'rom all sections of the country, and
within the next two weeks Pun Francisco
will have taken on almost as much of ;i
military Bftpect as when the volunteers
were camped here waiting for orders t'i
the front. _^__^__^____

track-followers watched him as he
left the betting ring and stood under
the shadow of the grand stand
to see the race. The horses moved
restlessly from the paddock. In a
moment they were lined before
the starter. The barrier was raised
and the men who were looking
at the old teamster saw the lines of
tragic, excitement in his face. In an
other minute the old man turned
away. The horse upon which he had
wagered his life had lost.

thus' Poor Showing.
The California Derby, one of the swell
stakes of the exiled Pacific Coast Jockey
Club, was decided at Oakland yesterday,
and turned out a decidedly frappe affair.
When Corrigan's Corsine, ridden by Pig
gott, returned to the stand winner his vic
tory failed to evoke a single cheer or dem
onstration of any sort. The attendance,
too, was light, that is for Derby day, there
being apparently no additions to the usual
I Saturday crowd. The race was set for
I and should have been decided just one
month ago. At that time the. Ingleside
Association was engaged in a debate with
the Supervisors, which fact was taken
advantage of by Corrigan to have the
1 event postponed. Then, too, it was hinted
that Corstne had developed signs of lame
| ness, while the other candidates, trained
j to the hour and right on edge, were eager
for the bugle call announcing post time.
At that stage of this turf idyl Formero
was considered a certainty, with Survl- â 
vor the dangerous one. In the interim I
First Tenor went amiss, and the owners I
of Formero and Survivor, disgusted at ,
the reprehensible tactics of this one-man
club, shipped their charges East, whore
they could contest for stakes tinder a less j
corrupt management. No general ever i
outlined his plan of battle better. Every- j
thing matured iust about as the Corrigan
confederacy had figured. While Corsine
was gradually receiving his "prep" those â 
of the original nominations eligible were I
losing all semblance of true form. And j
so yesterday Urn Corrigan colt was !
"cherry ripe," with virtually nothing to !
contest the prize with him. Such palpa- !
ble unfairness did not pass unperceived I
by a sport-loving public and this in a I
measure accounts for the deathlike still
ness with which the winner was received,
! even though piloted by Joe Piggott, Cali
i fornia's most popular rider.
What betting was done on the race waa
restricted mostly to Corsine, which ruled
a pronounced favorite throughout. Olin- i
thus, badly beaten by the Corrigan entry
on Thursday, came in for small support,
find so <li'l Los Medanos', Gauntlet, Lime- !
water and Ballista were nibbled at, but
I tickets on Earl Islington, which looked as |
badly out of place as a tramp in a draw
j incr room, could not be given away.
The rare is scarce worthy of descrip
tion. Before a mile had been traversed
Pipgott had Corsine in front, and the '
I Riley colt won easing up from Gauntlet
jin 2:08%. Olinthus, roughly handled by
Shields, ran third, followed in by Lime
water and Los Medanos. Balista and
Earl Islington were both pulled up.
Five other events were decided, of
which number the favorites won four.
Jenkins, Thorpe and Piggott divided the
saddle honors.
The racing began with a five-furlong
sprint for two-year-olds. Artilla, the
Corrigan entry, and Rachel C closed equal
favorites in the betting. The latter mare
took the lead in the stretch, winning
hands down from the 20 to 1 shot, Giga.
Artilla was slow in getting underway,
finally finishing third.
The Sehreiber stake had but four start
ers, and was easily captured by Corri
gan's Golden Rule, the 1 to 7 chance, rid
den by Piggott. Mountebank finished a
good second in front of Bamboulia.
Galen Brown's clever plater Wyoming
had first call in the betting in the mile
selling run. and was beaten hands down
by Potente. The latter horse made all
the running and at the wire had consid
erable in reserve. Jack Ward landed ivia
lay in the show.
Bernardillo came out of retirement and
was installed a warm favorite for the
mile and a sixteenth run. He was
asked to down some very moderate com
pany, but at the end had little to spare
when leading New Moon over the mark a
neck.
The six-furlong handicap fell to Dr.
Sheppard. which wns coupled in the bet
ting with Miss Rowena. the pair ruling
favortes. The doctor picked up 118 rounds,
and coming from fourth position in the
stretch finished a length in advance of
the light-weighted Tony Licalzi. Show
honors went to La Goleta.
WRECKED HIS HOME
WHILE DRINK-CRAZED
PATRICK J. O'NEIL CREATES
HAVOC IN SHORT ORDER.
Drives His Wife Out of the House
and Then Demolishes Every
thing of Value.
Patrick J. O'Neil, a painter, went to his
home at 319 Eureka street last evening
in an inebriated condition and on being
remonstrated with by his wife became
furious and drove her from the house.
While the latter was receiving the sym
pathy of her neighbors the liquor-crazed
husband began to vent his ire on the fur
nishings in the house.
Crash after crash was heard by the
gathered neighbors, but no one dared en
ter the citadel to see what O'Neil was
doing. A messenger was hastily dis
patched to the Seventeenth-street police
station, and when Acting Lieutenant
Hagarty was informed of the trouble he
hastily dispatched Officers J. Connolly
and P. Cleu to the scene in a patrol
wagon. When the officers entered the
house they found O'Neil putting the fin
ishing touches to the wreck he had
wrought. He was unceremoniously taken
into custody and handcuffed. His right
hand was covered with blood, due to a
nasty cut he received in breaking a mir
ror. A towel was placed around his hand
and, amid the jeers of the people in the
neighborhood, he was driven to the police
station, where charges of disturbing the
peace and of committing malicious mis
chief were placed against him. As he
was bleeding profusely from his wound
he was taken to the City and County
Hospital, where it was dressed. He de
clined to give any reason for his action.
A survey of the home of the frenzied
house painter disclosed a scene of ruin.
The floors were covered with broken
glass, dishes, gas globes, ga,Â«Â» fixtures,
mirrors, pictures, etc. The pictures were
torn from the walls and mangled. Look
ing glasses were scattered around the
rooms, cracked, smashed and made use
less. Not a window in the house was left
Intact and, in fact, everything of value
was broken beyond repair.
EVERY DOG MAY
HAVE HIS DAY
Only a Week More for Entries in the
Big Bench Show at the
Pavilion.
Never in the history of San Fran
cisco dog shows have entries been made
at such an early stage as for this show.
Owners seem to have realized at last that
the earlier they enter their dogs the
better are the chances for a flawless cata
logue. Inquiries at the office of the San
Francisco Kennel Club at 238 Montgomery
street have developed the fact that the
number of entries already made amounts
to 325. With this unprecedented early
entry the chances are more than favora
ble that this year will see about a thou
sand dogs on the bench at the Mechanics'
Pavilion. A. M. Thomson, the clerk of
the club, is punctuating the entries with
the sweat of his corrugated brow, while
genial Harry Carlton, the secretary,
wears an expansive smile and a bright
gunk Ha.
Among the additional cups and trophies
offered since the premium list was Issui <i
it is understood that George Crocker's
and H. A. wegener's will figure promi
nently. The American Mastiff I'lub has
offered a lung string for competition, in
cluding silver challenge cups, shields and
gold medals. The unique feature of the
show will be the parade of greyhounds in
tr, lining on the penultimate night (if the
show. After the parade the hounds will
line up before the judge for competition
for three silver cups, one each for the
best dog and bitch and one for the best
puppy. These cups will cost $50 each.
Such noted dogs as For Freedom, Fals?
Flatterer, Emm Pasha, Gladiator, Royal
Flush and over a hundred others will
figure in the parade and competition.
it should be distinctly understood that
no ptdlgree is required to show your dog.
A dog is judged in the ringâ not what he
is, not for the qualities or defects of his
sire and dam. If your dog has no pedi
gree the American Kennel Club requires
the annual payment of 25 cents for listing
to entitle him to the privilege of exhi
bition under the rules of the club. For $1
a pedigreed dog can he registered, which
gives to the animal the added value of a
certified pedigree and enables him to be
shown during his lifetime without any
further expense. Registrations can be
made through the clerk of the San Fran
cisco Kennel Club, which will act as agent
for the owner.
Competition is rife among: the different
breeds. The St. Bernard Club promises
to bench 150 of the holy breed. Cocker
spaniels and fox terriers will probably
rank next. The Pacific Mastiff Club ex
pects to show about twenty-seven watch
dogs.
Advances made on furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. J. Noonan. 1017-1023 Mission.
Had His Head Cut.
Charles Flood, living at 4G2 Eddy street,
while jumping off a car at Market stveet
and Grant avenue last evening, fell and
sustained an ugly scalp wound and an
abrasion of the forehead. He was taken
to the Receiving Hospital, where his in
juries were dressed t>y Police Surgeon
Weil.

Phil Bekeart, H. McMurchy, Dr. E. N
bhort and families departed from this city
yesterday for a two-week outing in the I
wilds of >iendocino County. Every sports
man in the State who has snapped at a
pigeonâ animate or inanimateâ from a i
txan ls acquainted with either Bekeart or
McMurchy. Sufficient to say that they '
are champions of the game of pull and
hit, bui bo far as trout ilshing 1.- con
cerned there are many fijsclples of Walton
who will be irprised to learn that the
crack pigeon grassers have on this occa
rton discar the gun for the rod. Bek
eart contends that he Is as clever with
the rod as he is with the iron Instrument
and can easily discern the difference b<
tween a Dolly Varden and a Loch Leven
or steelhead trout, but McMurchy Is mod
est and contends that people do* riot Irve j
long enough on this earth to become mac- j
tere -of two games. Dr. Short, although
an authority on the kind of angling that
pertains to the sea, do< a not profess to
.have a wide knowledge of the habits or
oha-ra'cveristics of artadromous fishes; con
sequently he will avoid as far as possible
any discussion that may arise during the |
outing relative to the varieties of fresh j
water fishes that are indigenous to the
rivers and streams of Mendocino County.
' Tne sportsmen are, however, supplied
with divers kind of tackle that should
tempt the most exacting Bekeart Dolly
Varden to sample. Lures of the feathered
kind or that which Phil used during mess
when a boy, commonly called a spoon, |
will be tried on many streams which are I
far distant from the common herd of j
local stream trampers.
William Meyers of Cazadero, charged
with fishing by means of dynamite in
Austin Creek, was held for trial last Mon- I

The Vallejo Chronicle goes after the:
poachers in this manner, ft says:
It has been reported to some of our sport
loving citizens that the guilty parties (mean
ing the .owners and users of the captun and
destroyed net) bail from Napa, and it is fur
ther said that Green Valley trout are openly
Bold In Napa markets. It Is a shame that these
poachers cannot be caught in their work an.l I
given the punishment they so richly deserve. j
The Fish r<..mmisf-ion refused a COU] of
ypars ago ,n supply any more flFh to Napa
County because of the Illegal fishing there,
â¢which the authorities made no attempt to Btip
press. Now that their streams no longer fur
nish them with fish they come over into Bo

Vallejoltes have insured good eport to legiti- j
mate fishermen. We are also tol dthat riant

there are no better trout streams In this State
than those of Santa Cruz County.
As we sat around the campflre at night dis
ctlÃÃlng the. matter, we all attributed the causi
of this scarcity of trout to the month nf com-'
m<-'ncemÂ»nt nf the open season, because of the
females caught on' this first trip we found near
ly every on* full of spawn. N'iw, for every one'
of such fish caught, hundre ' of prospective
fish were destroyed at the same time. There
are probably thousands of anglers out after
these beauties and tho destruction Is Increased
ln*Vroi>ortlon, of course.
At the present rate of decreose-^-and I speak
from careful observation and personal expe
rienceâbut a few years will elapse until our
fishing will be worthless, or else the State
hatcheries will be required to double the
amount of stock placed in the streams. Could
th<" month of beginning of open season for
trout be May Instead of April, as .-it present,'
nil this needless waste and destruction would
be avoided.
Tii-- Supervisors of our countyâ Santa Cruz
extended the open reason from November 1 to
December 1. In order to Include salmon trout,'
%vhich Is all right concerning trout of which I
Kpcak; but the gentlemen have no power to
change, the opening month Of the season.
The Idea has .-â¢â 1 to me that If sports
men all over the State would concern them
selves about this matter and -present the facts
to the members of the Legislature, the open
ing month for trout might be changed from
Atnil to May Instead, and while that would
delay our sport a month every year. H would
also increase our catch and aFMst nature and
the hatcheries at th<- same time.
True sportsmen ! cannot â¢â  hHp feeling guilty
when taking trout in the month of April, al
though such fishing is entirely lawful. Yours
for good.trputlng. . F. COATEB.
For the information of the writer and
those interested In shooting and fishing
the State 'Legislature of two years ago
pave Supervisors, of the counties the
power to shorten the fishing and game
seasons at their pleasure, but they must
not extend them.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 16, 1899.
BRENNEKE WAS
STRUCK WITH A
BROOM-HANDLE
Was Trying to Wreck
a Saloon.
HIS SKULL WAS FRACTURED
CORONER'S JURY RENDERS A
VAGUE VERDICT.
â 
Saloon-Keeper Anderson Said to Have
Broken the Stick Upon the Sail
or's Head to Protect His
Property.
Adnlph Anderson, proprietor of the
inavian saloon on Montgomery
avenue, near Jackson street, was brought
before Coroner Hill yesterday morning to
attend the inquest on the body of William
Brenneke, the sailor who was taken out
of Anderson's saloon with a fractured
skull last Tuesday morning. It was al
leged that Anderson had broken the sail
or's head with a stick. Robert Ferra.l ap
peared as counsel for Anderson.
Joseph Bausch and Charles Johansen
were the principal witnesses. It appeared
I that all the parties were drunk in Ander
son's saloon and that Johansen and
1 Brenneke engaged in a fight in front of
: the counter. Brenneke being knocked
(i'lwn and receiving two black eyes. The
fighters were separated by Anderson, who
: hit Johansen in the back of the neck with
his lift and threw him out of the saloon.
! Brenneke, enraged at being whipped,
' picked up a chair and proceeded to use it
as a flail on the furniture of the saloon.
: Anderson thereupon struck him on the
i hrad with a broomstick. The blow felled
Brenneke to the floor and rendered him
unconscious. The police were summoned
and the injured sailor was taken to tha
City Kfcefvlng Hospital, where he be
came violently insane and died the next
day.
Dr. Zabala. autopsy surgeon for the
Coroner, found that the dead man's skull
had been fractured and that a ppllntt-r
of wood had penetrated the brain just
over the eve. The piece of wood came
from the broomhandle.
The material discrepancy between the
testimony ctf Bausch and that of Johan
s< n was that as to the tight, Johansen
swearing that he did not remember hav
ing come to blows with Hrenneke and
Bausch swelling that Johansen kicked
Brenneke after he had knocked him down.
The broomstick was broken in three
pieces. The end of it had a groove cut
in it, and had been used to turn on the
gap in front of the saloon.
The Jury returned a verdict to the ef
that Hrennekf came to his death
from cerebral hemorrhage due to fracture
of the skull "and that said death was a
r. suit of injuries received }U the hands
of a person or persons unknown."
The verdict was approved by Coroner
Hill.

all accounts be true, in listening to the exhortations of a young divine
who only arrived in this city last evening. Rev. Walter Myron Lowell

of his church. He is an elder of the Methodist Episcopal church and is on
his way to Germany. Bishop Newman, Drs. Wilson, Case, Carroll, Burn
side, Hartapee, Bovard, Evans and Lamont, General Bidwell and a host of
others speak for his merits as author, preacher, lecturer and friend. The

Connemara Is the Favorite for the
Open Stake. With Black Dia
mond in the Lead for the
Puppy Prize.
Between 500 and fiOO people journeyed out
to Union Coursing Park yesterday to Bee
the dogs run, and they were rewarded
by witnessing some good Bport. notwith
standing the. fact that most ot the courses
were unusually short. No less than a
dozen shortenders won the flag in the
open stake, and considerable money
changed hands. The biggest surprise of
the day was the defeat of Mystic Maid
by Lady Gilmore, alto 10 shot. False
Flatterer, an 8 to 1 favorite, got the de
cision over Leonidas, and Flush, who was
quoted at 7 to 1 over Seminole, also lost.
In the latter case luck had a great deal
to do with the result. Flush leading and
turning the hare back to Seminole, who
â was therefore enabled to count Beveral
points which the favorite had no oppor
tunity to overcome, as the course was a
*hort one. Beauty Spol was also pre
s.-nted with a victory over Firm Friend,
a 1 to 1 favorite In a fluky course.

handily at odds of 2 to 1. St. Oran. sec

better to-day to stand any show with
Connemara. The crazy Jassamy beat
Magneto and then played her old trick of
running away, causing a long delay be
fore she was captured and returned to the
kennels. L. S. Conley beat the 5 to 1 fa
vorite, Royal Prize, after running a "no

and Trinket beat Minneapolis at 1 to 2.

team has nothing but a retrospect of de
feat. The game yesterday at the Six
teenth and Folsom street grounds was
won by a score of 9 to 7.
The Stanford men were backing their
team to win, despite the defeat it had suf
fered at the hands of California a week
ago. Lanagan, the great pitcher, who
struck out ten men in the last game, was
counted upon as the man who could do
the trick, but Stanford's hopes burst like j
an inflated bubble when the stick men !
from across the bay began their pyro- j
technic show in the very first Inning. Be- j
fore they retired four men had been sent j
across the plate, and L,anagan's red shirt |
was in strong contrast with his pale, lu
gubrious face. It seemed as if the ball
would not stop- rolling.
It all happened this way: Chesebrough j
was sent walking to first, McLaren hit to j
left field and Swan to center, followed. by
Hamlin for a three-bagger. He scored j
upon a hit by Hunter to Murphy, who
courteously dropped the ball.
In the next inning California duplicated
the great run-making act and scored
three times. Wolf, Mem and Chese- j
brough getting the credits. It was quiet,
peaceful baseball from that time until
the fourth, when California added aHOther :
run to its column. Then the Palo Alto [
lillies awoke from their sleep and broke
the ice-caking by sending Carson and ,
Young across the plate. At the beginning '
of the second half of the fifth inning the
score read California S and Stanford 2. .
All the wrath and supplications the car- j
dinal coaches had on tap were poured :
upon the heads of the youthful red-shirt- ;
ed athletes, and it wrought good results.
For a time all that could be heard was
the rapping out of the leathern ball.
There were two outs when the Stanford
run-germ began its wild career. Carson
swatted the ball to right field, where Mien
performed a Juggling act and Carson!
scored. Then Edwards came with a sin
gle, and so did Lanagan, with Murphy j
on his train for a three-bagger. Loug- I
heed was jealous of this performance and i
he lost the ball for another three-bagger, j
"When the inning was finally wound up i
Stanford had five more runs to its ac
count and the score card read California
9, Stanford 7, which remained unchanged. |
The rest of the game was a silent wait- i
ing full of expectancy, but nothing came I
of it. Kaarsberg and Lanagan both set- j
tied down to steady work and no runs |
were made. The fielding of California
was specially fine, that of Wolf in the left
territory being no less than brilliant. The
score is as follows:

WILL SING AND DANCE
At the Great Charity Benefit at
THE ORPHEUM FRIDAY
QUERITA VINCENT, One of the Volunteers Who Will Sing and Dance
at the Fruit and Flower Mission Benefit Next
Friday at the Orpheum.
NO mnrn worthy object of charity exists In this city than the inptitu
tion known as the Fruit and Flower Mission. The ladies of the mission
devote their time and the money at their disposal to providing little
dflicacies, fruits and flowers for the sick in the various hospitals of
this city. At present the mission is very low in funds, and to provide the
same at once the management of the Orpheum has donated the use of their
theater and the artists tor a benefit on Friday afternoon, April 21. All
this is free of charge for rent, lights or other set-vice and every dollar that
is taken in at the box office will go to swill the Fruit and Flower Mis
sion's fund. Director Rosner and Leader Jaulus of the Orpht-um's famous
orchestra have volunteered their services, together with that of the entire
orchestra, and Director Rosner is arranging a special musical programme
for that day. Stage Manager Harry Orndorff and his assistants will con
tribute their labor.
The Orpheum's regular bill will include Favor and Sinclair, the popular
comedians who bare Bcored such a hit in their new art entitled, "A High
Roller." Mr. Favor has long been known as a comedian with some of the
best legitimate companies in th<> country, and since he has gone into vaude
ville has appeared at the Orphenm on several occasions, always with great
success. His new act is by far the funniest he has yet been seen in in San
Francisco. Miss Sinclair is an excellent fi>il for Mr. Favor's comedy. An
other star attraction is Clarice Vance, who styles herself "Tours in Rag
Time." It is doubtful if there has ever appeared at the Orpheum a
of coon songs who has scored a greater hit than has Miss Vance. She has
several new coon songs in rehearsal for this occasion. No bill nowadays is
complete without a genuine colored team, and of the many who have re
cently come into vaudeville not one is more favorably known than Al and
Mamie Anderson. They were one of the first colored teams to make their
appearance at the Orpheum some two years ago, and they are always sure
of a cordial greeting whenever they step upon the Orpheum stage.
Another act that is well calculated to please is that by Tom and Lilly
English, the musical comedians. Of all the many star features there is
none better than the act by Miss Lillian Burkhart and company, who appear
in Miss Burkhart's latest comedy sketch entitled "Extravagance," the story
of which Is founded upon the efforts of the husband, who would cure his wife
of her extravagant Ideas of dress and household expenses. It is very funny,
and the situations extremely ludicrous. Miss Burkhart Is a great favorite
with Orpheum patrons, and neither she nor her company need any Introduc
tion to the San Francisco public. Marshall P. Wilder has had his thinking
cap on and will appear In an entirely new line of sayings got together espe
cially for this occasion. Then there are the dainty Hengler sisters, who have
scored so well since they have been at the Orpheum. They will appear in
their chic Parisian dances and songs. Mile. Clara Laxdinois Is also a feature
of the bill, and co are the Pantzer brothers, head-to-head balancers.
Besides the regular Orpheum bill there will be a number of volunteer
artists. So far as arranged by Manager Morrisey the volunteer talent will be
Querfta Vincent, from the Olympla, and Miss Mlndell Fern Dreyfuss. Miss
Vincent has proved the greatest drawing card the Olympia has ever had.
No stronger testimony can be offered as to her ability than the fact that
she ha.s played twelve consecutive works at the Olympia and is to-day more
popular than when she opened. She will appear at the Orpheirm. in coon songs
and buck and wing dances, in which she. excels. Miss Dreyfuss is a well
known soprano of this city, her particular forte being serio-comic songs. In
this line of work she excels, and her friends predict a brilliant career for her.
In consideration of the extra long programme and the unusual attractions
offered and the fact that the object is a most worthy one, the Orpheum man
agement has agreed that the prices for this grand event shall be 50 cents to
the entire lower floor and 2"Â» cents to the balcony, and the total receipts go
to the Fruit and Flower Mission.
Ilorwinski Bros, have donated the programmes, and a number of florists
â¢will contribute flowers. There will be several young ladies from the various
theaters of the city as well as those of the Orpheum company who will dis
tribute programmes and flowers.
The sale of reserved seats is now on, and from all indications there
will be a packed house.
BATTLE FOR A
CARDINAL AX
Give 'em the ax, the ax, the ax.
Give 'em the ax, the ax, the ax.
WHERE?
Right In the neck, the neck, the nprk.
Right in the neck, the neck, the neck.
THERE.
This very blank verse Is one of Stanford's strident yells, and some 200
students were practicing it upon a helpless baseball crowd yesterday at the
intercollegiate game. In order to make the noise more graphic: they brought
with them an ax of stupendous size and a block by which they hoped to il
lustrate the decapitation intended for California. The ax was painted a
bright red and the block a deep blue. Every time Stanford's pitcher did
anything noteworthy up and down wont the ax. This ax proved a boom
erang, cutting off the cardinal's head and being the cause of a street fight
between the supporters of both colleges.
When the game was over and the bleachers cleared of howling colle
gians some of the Berkeley students hit upon the idea of confiscating the ax
or at least appropriating it to their own use. They massed on B'olsom street
and awaited the mournful band of Stanford students, who were pouring out
of the gates. At last came the axman, and the signal for a charge was
given. Immediately there was a mingling of blue, gold and cardinal. Down
Folsom street the struggling, heaving, shifting press of college "men battled,
one side to obtain the other to retain the heavy, gory ax. Coats were torn,
collars pulled off, ties destroyed and hats smashed. After a fight which en
dured until the opposing armies reached Fourteenth street the ax came into
the possession of a Berkeley man and was carried off, the supine cardinal
forces forming a wake of two blocks in length.
During the early hours of the evening the Stanford men were running the
fiery cross to gather their liegemen for a battle at the ferry when the Berke
ley men should cross with the spoils of war. The casualties were several
sprained thumbs and much rent clothing.
Crushed on a Dredger.
OAKLAND. April 15.â Chris F. Lund,
aged 22 years and residing at 525 Filbert
street, was severely injured on the
dredger in Lake Merritt to-night. His
hands were caught between the rope and
the drum of the donkey engine and were
badly crushed, his face and right arm
being also injured. Fortunately the en
gine was stopped before he sustained
further harm. At the Receiving Hospital
two fingers of the left hand and one of
the right hand were amputated.
MIXED THINGS
IN THE BAR OF
THE OCCIDENTAL
Two Swells Tangle Up
With Tourists.
THE PORTER TOOK A HAND
MESSRS. BOOMER AND CLARKE
COME TO GRIEF.
They Tried to Break In on a Party of
Englishmen Who Were Being
Entertained by Assessor
Dodge.
Two young bloods of thfÂ» Fwaps^ set
got mixfii up with an official dignitary
and a party of English tourists in the Oc
cidental Hotel bar shortly before midnight
Thursday, and while anxious frier
all parties concerned in the row have I" â¢ n
since slyly hurrying about town enjoin
ing eye-witnesses to strict secrecy, two
battered representatives of the bonton
brigade have remained within the con
fines of their ro'iinn nursing bruised
"fronts" and injured feelings.
Alec Boomer, son of the millionaire
stage-owner; Ed Clarke, prospective
to the wealth of his mother, Mrs. Jere
miah Clarke; Assessor Dodge and a party
of wealthy Englishmen were the
gation who furnished the mixologists be
hind the Occidental bar the liveliest mix
up it has been their good fortune to wit
ness outside of a priz" ring. To mention
the Assessor and the tourists in the same
breath with the young club men i:i this
case is hardly fair, as Doctor I :
his friends, according to the tesi
eye-witnesses, were literally forced into
the fray.
Dr. Dodge and the Englishmen, who wore
guests at the hotel, w . tng at the
bar taking a quiet little nightcap, when
Boomer and Clarke sauntered in from the
billinrd-room, where they had just nar
rowly avoided a row with one of the Hoff
man boys. The young swells had evi
dently been playing a star engug* raent "ii
the cocktail route during the evening and,
in the language of Palsy Carroll, were
"all ablaze."
Clarke took first liberties and started
the ball a-rolling by Inviting one of the
tourists to shake dice fur a bottle of
wine. The man from across the pond
eyed the local clubman contemptuously,
froze up like a New York water main and
said in rather chilly fashion:
"Oh, I don't know' you, sir."
That was too much for young r-larke'9
heated condition, so he thumped the tour
ist in the short ribs, and, taking <">ff the
stranger's hat, hooked the crown of the
%kypiece under the tip of John Build
nose and gave it a wicked jerk upward.
Then active international complications
were inaugurated. Somebody threw a
whisky glass, somebody shouted "Land
on him, Chauncey," and then the pri
bunch got tangled up in a real genuine
Donnybrnok Fair ruction. Fists fjew
fast, and, judging- from the da/nage dor..',
they reached the mark often. One of the
tourists sent a left li< .< >R to Clarke's
1 read basket, and when the unfortunate
young swell doubled up another tourist
landed on his eye.
Boomer is a rather husky youth and he
fought gamely against such long odds,
managing to reach one of the tourists sev
eral times without inflicting any serious
damage. Dr. Dodge in the meantime i\ v
making strenuous efforts Co restur.- peace.
The hotel porter was pressed into ser
vice, and in a moment all parties con
cerned* In the row were busily engaged
picking up crushed hats and rubbing
bruised features before the mirror.
Boomer and Clarke were ordered to
leave the cafe, but neither of them dis
playing any marked desire to obey or
ders, the hotel porter was pressed Into
action again. He hustled them bodily
out of the cafe, and when they reached
the sidewalk both bloods again showed
fight. One of them made a savage pass
at the porter, but the "trunk wrestler"
ducked away. They closed in on the por
ter, who waited until they came wilhin
reach, and when they arrived he la
out with left and right, knocking both
down.
At this juncture Policeman McGuire ar
rived, and had it not been for the inter
vention of friends the young men would
have been locked up. McGuire took
charge of the belligerent swells and led
them down Montgomery street. At Mar
ket street the vanquished clubmen sought
the pensive quiet of a dimly lighted cab
and repaired to their homes to reduce
lumps and discoloratlons.

THE INSTITUTE IN SESSION
NEED OF EDUCATING THE YOUNG
FARMERS.
Professor Fowler Explains the Pur
pose of the University Agri
cultural Experimental
Stations.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 15.
The second annual Farmers' Institute,
i held under the auspice's of the University
of California . agricultural ' department,
| met in Ford's Hall at Niles this afternoon
and continued during the evening. The
attendance was larger than last year,
while the â¢ interest manifested was en
couraging to the speakers in the fullest
extent. .. ; â¢â ;;.-.Â»"'>.-'.;'
Henry Tyson, a well-known orehardist,
i presided and welcomed the professors of
i the university in a, short but appropriate
speech. He referred to the present splen
! did outlook ajid gave the credit for ii to
the Dlvhie Being,- who so opportunely- Bent
the needed rain.
Professor L>. T. JFowler responded. He
said in part: â¢ - â¢ ...... i
"The local pride for all that a locality
I produces is an encouraging" Bign. But the
absence of .the young nun and young
women from this meeting is to be regret
ted. How.to Interest uit.m, tbÂ» 'coming
farmers, is a problem. Mir work is to in
still into them a. Jove for and pi the work
and an appreciation of the farm and the
result of agriculture. Th,t> value of these
institutes is -the- opportunity to uplift the
young men and young women. They must
appreciate what agriculture means; its
: advancement and building up of the fam
ily home.' The farmer of yesterday did
not go about his work as the farmer of to
i day does. â  Science had not come to him,
but the farmer is slower to take advan
tage of the inventions *>Â£ th daj than
any other set of men.
'"The great problem of to-day is expan
sionâthe expansion of trade. We must
keep in touch with all to get this if we
are to get the best for the farmer.
"The California farmer above all others
should be the first to grasp this. Our lo
cation, with the great markets being
opened in the islands of the Pacific,
: makes a peculiarly favorable agricultural
condition. There is no place on the
earth that can grow such a diversity of
crops as California. We have had the
blessings- of a dry year. The poor man
that has suffered may not like that term
'blessing,' but 1 look upon this year as
! a great blessing. It has broken down
some set ideas that will result in a
great change here. It has developed an
inestimable- lesson In the preparation to
place water whtm and where needed.
"These institutes are uplifting. They are
; growing in interest. We don't know cv
i erything. Neither do you, but by thesa
papers, discussions and questions, both
sides Learn from the other."
Hon. John 1.. Beard spoke upon the
"Wine Grape." He said: "I knew a
great deal mor>- befon I planted a grape
vine than I do now after fifteen years'
rience. It is hard to determine the
kind of grapes to grow, but .one thing
has been proven beyond doubtâ what has
proven to be the best in other countries
are not tho best for this. The best 1 have
are those I took because they were com
mon."
Professor H. E. Jaffa followed upon
"Orchard Fertilization." He exhibited a
table compiled from results of examina
tion of European soils. By comparing the
average Californian soil with this table
he showed the fertilizers most need
ed in this State to be phosphoric acid and
nitrogen. This, he said, had been proven.
He also exhibited an elaborate table
showing the amount of soil ingredients
withdrawn by. various crops, and the
amount that could be returned by using
the waste as a fertilizer.
Mrs. F. O. Bunting read a very Inter
esting artirle on "Relation of Canners
and Driers to Fruit-growers." in which
j she urged co-operation to^'heck the ten
-1 dency of canners, driers a3id commission
merchants to get the advantage of the
grower. Considerable sarcasm was in
troduced and cordially received by the au
dience.
Professor C. H. Shinn closed the after
noon session with a talk on "Experimen
tal Stations.", Miss Evelyn Bunting and
Miss Helen Crane furnshed music be
tween the various papers.
â¢\t to-night's session papers were read
by Professor IÂ». T. Fowler, Dr. Emerson,

STOLE HIS ROOSTERS
BUT LEFT HIS GOLD
OAKLAND. April 15.â Henry Barnett was the victim of a daring highway
robbery last night, yet he Is thanking his lucky stars that his loss waa
not as great as it might have been. While driving to his home, shortly
before 9 o'clock, along the Dublin road, in Palamora Canyon, two miles
this side of Dublin, he was Btopped by two highwaymen. One held his horse
while the other rilled his pockets, securing $9 in silver money. The highway
men then took from the wagon a baker's dozen of fat roosters and twelve
dozen fresh eggs, and ordered him to drive off.
Harriett was fortunate, nevertheless, for the robbers failed to discover a
pocket on the Inside of his woolen overshirt which contained $175 in gold
coin. To-day Barnett reported the robbery at the Sheriff's office, and now the.
Constables of Eden and Murray Townships are scouring the hills and can

ARTIST HOLDREDGE
DIES A PAUPER
SAD END OF A ONCE FAMOUS
LANDSCAPE PAINTER.
One of the Founders of the Art Asso
ciation Which Was the Nucleus
of Hopkins Art Institute.
Alamedn Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, April 16.
R. G. Holdredge, artist and well-known
character about town, who claimed to In
one of the originators of the Bohemian
<'!ub of San Francisco, died this after
noon at the County Infirmary. Holdredge
was taken to the infirmary yesterday,
penniless and hungry, and although his
acquaintances Here expected that his end
was not far off. it was not thought that
he would he called so soon to render his
final account.
Eloldredge has had a remarkable ca
reer. Before he took up the study of art
he was head draughtsman at Mare Isl
and. Hlfl natural genius was recognized
by his friends, and they assisted him. to
8" to Paris, where he studied under the
gnat masters. Alter traveling extensive
ly through Europe he return.'.] to the I'a
dflc Qoaat, where he soon gain^,] the rep
utation of being one of the leading land
scape artists of that day, taking rank
with Hill and painters of equal note.
He was i>nÂ«' of the organizers of the Art
Association, which subsequently devel
oped into the Hopkins Art Academy. He
was air early member of the Bohemian
club. He classed among his closest
friemis Charles Warren Stoadard, Robert
Louis Stevenson and ofher well-known
men of letters.
Holdredge made considerable money as
an artist, but convivial habits started him
on the decline, and when he came to
Alameda, about ten years?, ago, he was
all but penniless, but managed to eke
out an existence with his brush and pal
let. His ambition was to be a great por
trait artist, but his natural talents turned
toward landscapes. He has often stated
that this was the disappointment of his
life, and was the direct cause of leading
him to drink.
â¢ Deceased was a native of New York,
about tvi years of age. He leaves a sister,
Jennie Holdredge. who resides at 20a
California street. The remains will be in
terred m the expense of the county.
1 mring the Sioux war Holdredge was an
artist on Sorihner's Magazine, and was
with the United States troops when Gen
eral Custer was massacred by Sitting
Bull.

MAJOR BALDWIN'S ROYAL
BLOOD CAUSES TROUBLE
MAJOR WILLIAM H. BALD
WIN", commissary of subsist
ence, T'nited States army, at
present engaged in purchas
ing supplies in San Francisco for
the us.- of T'nrle Sam's brave soldier
boys who are fighting the half-sav
age Tagallos in the Philippines, has
a fund of humor as expansive as his
eorporoslty. and when it is remem
bered that the major tips th<* scales
at something like 200 pounds,
stripped. It is easy to realise that
life with him has no dark and
gloomy side. Jn fact, aside fromÂ»his
official duties the major refuses to
take life seriously, but fes a joke
â¢with a facility that is the envy and
at the same time the despair of his
brother officers and associates.
Ever since the outbreak of hos
tilities with Spain over a year affo
cranks and freaks of all descriptions
have been In the habit of drifting
Jnto the quarters of the major In
the commissary headquarters on
N< w Montgomery street, and the
jovial officer has evolved moro
pleasure from their Individual visits
than an ordinary person could Ret
out of a first-class minstrel per
formance. He has been made the
target for tragic threats and queer
petitions galore, but he treats them
all as jokes and chuckles gleefully
over his experiences.
A short time ago a young man of
imposing mem and pompous manner
called upon Major Baldwin, and
after pome preliminary conversation
apropos of nothing requested a favor
in connection with a contract for
furnishing supplies for the army.
He was Informed that he must take
his chances with other contractors,
whereupon he waxed indignant and,
swelling out his chest like a turkey
gobbler, informed the military man
that he was a person of Importance
and that he was on terms of Inti
macy with high administration offi
cials.
â I have traveled and associated
with the best of them," he declared
proudly. "Why. I have borrowed
money from the Secretary of the
Treasury."
"Giv us another Cabinet officer,"
chuckled the major.
"I am a nephew of the Secretary

vidual, "and if you do not see fit to
grant my request I shall make it my
business to see that you are dis
ciplined."

IN HONOR OF LINCOLN.
The Monument League Meets and
Transacts Important Business.
Last evening the Lincoln Monument
League of California met in the rooms of
the I'nion League flub. Palace Hotel.
comrade Charles Edelman moved that a
committee of five be appointed to draft
suitable resolutions commemorative of
the thirty-fourth anniversary of the death
of the martyred Lincoln. President W.
W. Stone appointed on the committee
General Edward S. Salomon, A. J. Vinlng,
j John A. Whitesides, Frank E. Myers and
I Judge M. Cooney, who prepared the fol
lowing:
This day, the "15th. day of April, being the
anniversary of the death of Abraham Lincoln.
I we. the Lincoln Monument I<eafrue of f'aii-
I fornia, deem it the proper time to urge to rf>
nrwed efforts all those who fepl with us that
the accomplishment of our object Is one in
which all patriotic Americans are and ought to
! be deeply interested.
I Thirty-four years ago to-day, death, directed
by tin' cruel hand of an assassin, robbed this
j nation of Its greatest representative and all
humanity of Its grandest anil noblest champion.
The event plunged America into such grief and
sorrow as the world never before nor since wit
j nesse.J. There Is no occasion in the history of
i the world where the mourning of a preat nn
i tlon met with such universal and profound
i sympathy from all the peoples of the plohe as
i sorrowing America did on the Joss of that proat
: martyr of liberty.
We, therefore, on this anniversary pledge our
-1 selves to work faithfully and Incessantly and
: to '-"ntlnue our labors until a grand and noble
, monument will proudly stand upon the shores
I of the Pacific to proclaim by its grandeur to
I the world that we. the people of California.
] remember the services of Abraham T,lnco|n,
appreciate his greatness, revere his memory.
and wHI forever love it as that of the preatest
American who ever lived to defend universal
1 '.iberty and the equal rights of all mankind.
The resolution was unanimously adopt*
; ed by a rising vote.
A resolution was adopted Instructing the
chairman to appoint a committee of
seven, whose duty it shall be to secure
from the Board of Supervisors, the Mayor
and those in authority the most elieihle
position In the proposed panhandle exten
sion of Golden Gate Park. To this end
there was considerable discussion. There
was a universal desire expressed that the
most suitable point upon which to erect
the monument to Lincoln would be at the
Intersection of the boulevard entrance and
Van Ness avenue. Acting upon the sug-
"Good," retorted the major. "But
do you know who I am? I am a
nephew of the Prince of Wales."
The major's last shot floored the
visitor completely, and he retired
from the fk-ld crushed and speech
less. But the matter did not end
there. The "nephew" of the Secre
tary of War and "friend" of the
Secretary of the Treasury and other
Cabinet officers was determined on
revenge. He drew up a long com
plaint against Ma.ior Baldwin and
forwarded it to the War Depart
ment. In this complaint, amnng
other things, he charged that the
major was a foreigner and a scion
of royalty, and demanded to know
by what right an Englishman was
allowed to hold a commission In the
T'nited States army and entrusted
with the Important duty of purchas
ing provisions for American soldiers.
The document was forwarded to
"Washington, and underwent the
usual course of red tape, and was
finally returned to Major Baldwin,
decorated all over with hieroglyphic
indorsements and recommendations
affixed thereto by the various offi
cials through whose hands it had
passed. Major Baldwin has not re
ceived any notice of a prospective
court martial, and the receipt of the
peculiar document has afforded him
endless amusement.
A few days ago another beef con
tractor was complaining to the
major that the columns of stuff
published In the newspapers regard
ing the alleged poor quality of the
beef furnished the army during the
Santiago campaign had ruined hia
business. The major grew sympa
thetic at once.
"Why, my boy," Bald he, "I'll tell
you how you can sell all the beef you
can furnish, the newspapers will not
have an unkind word to say and the
soldiers will never utter a complaint
as to the quality of their rations."
"How is that?" eagerly inquired
the canned beef man.
"You just put a silver dollar in each
can of beef," advised the major,
"and everything will be lovely."
Needless to say, the seeker of beef
contracts wasted no mdre time or
words with an officer who could dis
cuss with levity the misfortunes of
his millionaire employers, and he
withdrew with a reproachful look on
his face, leaving the major shaking
with silent laughter.
gestion of a number present the chair will
delay appointing the committee until he
has carefully weighed the qualincattona
of members of the league who are fitted
for the proposed duties and to consult
with the Mayor in order to secure his
aid.
The chair was authorized to appoint a
committee of three to take in han-1 all
matters regarding future entertainments
to be given in furtherance of the objects
of the league. The league then adjourned
to the second Saturday evening in May.

PISTOLESI CONVICTED.
Acting Police Judge Barry Will Sen-
tence Him To-Morrow for Dis
turbing the Peace.
Attorney L. C. Pistolesi was convicted
by Acting Police Judge Barry yesterday
on the charge of disturbing the peace and
was ordered to appear for sentence to
morrow. On March 6 Pistolesi and Fred
Wickenhausen went t<> Bacon place and i
attempted to evict two women. The
women refused to move and a row ensued,
during which the nttorney and Wicken
hausen were arrested for disturbing the
peace.
In convicting Pistolesi the Judge re
marked that as an attorney he ought to
have known that the proper person to
serve the eviction papers w r as a Sheriff.
: As he had confessed that Wickenbausen
I had acted under his instructions he WouW
dismiss the case against Pistolesi'a agent.
Pistolesi sneeringly Insinuated that he
knew beforehand that he would be con
j victed. aS the Judge was biased against
I him, but he supposed that a fine of fa,
1 no alternative, would be imposed, which
would satisfy him. The, Judge hotly il -
' nied that there was any bias in his mind
against Pistolesi. and if he considered
that a fine of $:, with no alternative would
be imposed he was very much mistaken.
Pistolesi,. after he left the courtroom,
said he would appeal the case and would
do everything in his power to drive Barry
out of the Native Sons' organization and
ruin him politically. The Judge laughs at
i his threats.

AN HONEST BELLBOY.
; Returns a Large Sum to Major Hays
at the Palace.
Surgeon. Major Hays of the Siamese
I navy arrived at the Palace 00 Friday
morning, and yesterday he instructed the
bellboy on the second floor. Louis Pizarro
by name, to take the suit of clothes which
he had been wearing on his trip across
I tho continent to a tailor and have it
] cleaned and pressed. Young Pizarro, who
j is about 20 years of ngc. did so, and as he
; was passing through the halls with the
I suit on his arm a wallet containing cur
i reney consisting of .CIOOO sterling and $500
! in American notes fell out of the pocket
j of the coat.
Pizarro was astounded at the display
of so much wealth placed at his disposal,
but his honesty has always been above
par, and he forthwith bunted up Burgeon
; Hays and handed him the money. The
! major was agreeably surprised, as he had
quite forgotten t lint the bills were in that
part 'â â â¢â  coat pocket. He was profuse

i ro for bis honesty.
CITED FOR CONTEMPT.
Treasurer Truman Before Judge Cook
at a Stenographer's Instance.
City and County Treasurer I. J. Tru
man appeared before Judge Carroll Cook
yesterday morning in response to a cita
tion calling 1 upon him to appear and show
cause why he should not be punished for
contempt of court for failing to pay
Stenographer Stevens $110 for work done
in Department 12 of the Superior Court.
Truman refused to cash the stenograph
er's demand on tho ground that it should
first be passed by Auditor Wells. It is
claimed that the Supreme Court has held
upon several occasions that the formality
of placing the claims first before tha
Auditor is unnecessary, the signature ot
the Judge in whose court the stcnog
j rapher is employed being sufficient. Judge
Conk did not determine the action yester

I source that the regiment would return
from Manila in June.
The form which the reception will as
sume has not been determined. It will
be governed largely by the amount of
money available at the time. As a pre

which to entertain the Californians a mv
' sical and vaudeville show will be held
at Mechanics' Pavilion May 10. A varied
i programme will be prepared by the com
mittee in charge. This committee is drawn

HE HAD NOT FORGOTTEN
THE RED CROSS LADIES
WAN and bent, hollow cheeked and pallid with that dull, leaden pallor â¢
that bespeaks of Illness in a tropical clime, his eyes sunk deep into
their sockets, but burning with an unnatural glow, a mat of straw- <
tinted locks falling from beneath a gray slouch hat that was dented, c
drawn and twisted Into the most grotesque shape and covered with letters 4
; and symbols so dear to the soldier's fancy; his shrunken form leaning .
heavily on a stout stick, while the dingy blue trousers and brown canvas <
! blouse, much too large for the frame they covered, spoke mutely of long â¢
, and severe service by one who was not always overparticular as to his per- c
v Bonal appearance. All in all, he was about as dejected and forlorn an mdi- <
Â» vidual, and as far from the ideal of one of Uncle Sam's humble heroes, as S
could well be imagined. r
i "'â¢", ' Painfully and laboriously dodging the multitude of teams on East street i
and avoiding the hurrying commuters with an awkward expression of apol-
'Â» ogy for being in their way, he made his way to the ferry depot and down i
1 to the gate where the vehicles enter. Approaching the cross-grained gate- c
' keeper, he gazed at that individual Inquiringly a half minute before he yen- <
; tured to ask: â¢
'â¢Say, Mister, can th' boys go out thar' on th' wharf now?" (
! Something in the tone, as well as the appearance of the questioner, im- .
pelled the busy gateman to pause and then to grant the permission that is <
' extended to the boys in blue, a trifle less surlily than usual. i
"Thanky. Mister; jes' thought I'd like to take another look aroun' here," .
! and the bent ngure ambled down toward the slips. S
Past the baggage-room and on along the great building he moved, peer
! ing into first the narrow gauge and then the broad gauge waiting rooms as <
though looking for somebody or something. Not finding him or it, he kept â¢
! on until checked by the gate that divides the Southern Pacific section from ,
that of the Donahue road. His features bore unmistakable signs of disap- ,
' pointment as he turned and made his way back, stopping at one of the <
, slips while the passengers from one of the Oakland boats hurried ashore <
1 and out through the exit.
> "Don't seem to be no more Red Cross ladles here now," he ventured to j
' one of the officers of the boat who had followed the last passenger ashore <
> and paused at the end of the apron. . â¢
"Oh. no; they haven't been here since the last of the volunteers werÂ« j
' sent to Manila last summer," came the careless reply.
, "That so! I s'pose they thought they'd done all they could when they ;
' saw th 1 last of us off." A pause and then he went on: "Guess they didn't <
; think any of usd be comin' back an' might like to see 'em again, an' i
there'll be a whole lot as won't come back, shore 1 enuff. 'cept in boxes." '

. they'd get through talkln' about home. You see, th' first wimmin we met
' after we left home was them Red Cross ladies right here, an' you know, !
! neighbor, a kind word an' a flower an' somthin' kinder homelike to eat ,
counted a whole lot with th' boys, 'specially them that hadn't never been '

bring th' boys things an' help them write home, an' we'd come down here an' '
' they'd always have a cup o' hot coffee an' somethin' thet tasted good to eat. ,

> I would ever see either of 'em agin. Then came th' attack on Manila an' th' ,
fightin', and me an' th' rest o' th' boys what could get outen bed fergot all
' about th' fever an' joined their companies. I was actually gettin' well when |

they'd get along all right 'lthout me. "You see, father's gettin' pritty old '
' now an' I'm th' only one of th' boys who'd stayed with him on the farm. I ;
' thought too, of these wimmin here, an' was sorry I wasn't never goin' to (

"But after a while I got better an' they decided to send me back, though ,
'â¢ the doctors said it was doubtful if I stood th' voyage home.. Once on the trip
I had a bad turnâ coughed up blood, you know, an' th" doctor said I might ;
' not live till we got to San Francisco. I made up my mm', though, that
p I would at least live till I got among th' Red Cross ladies again, an' now I'm '
' so much better th' doctor says I can go home soon. Think o' that, neighbor. ,
I'd about given up th' idea of seem' ma and th' rest an' was 6atisfyin* my- '
' 6 elf with th' thought that I'd just manage to get this far. But I'm goin' ,
home. Maybe I can go nex.' week. Say, won't ma an' pa be tickledâ an' won't '

PROPERTY THAT IS TAXABLE.
City and County Attorney Lane
Sends the Board of Supervisors
an Important Opinion.
City and County Attorney Lane has
sent to the Board of Supervisors an opin
ion bearing on several questions as to the
liability of certain goods to taxation. The
first of these relates to goods consigned
to this State from another State. After
quoting the statute and the rules and
i.^illations of the State Board of Equali
zation bearing on the subject, Mr. Lane
"The conclusion must therefore be
reached that the State statute must gov
ern and goods consigned to this State |
from another State for Pale must be :
taxed even though In original packages!
and In the hands of the consignor."
Regarding insurance companies. Attor
ney Lane advises the board that money
in the hands of a general agent of an in- j
Burance company is taxable. Premiums
due and in the course of collection are
h.ld to b*V taxable as "solvent credits."
In the matter of stocks it is held that
"the shares of stock corporations, the
tangible property of which is situated
and taxed in this' State. may not be taxed,
but that the shares of stock of corpora
tions, the tangible property of which is
situated in another State, may be taxed."' I

each number on the varied and excellent
programme was heartily applauded, in
fact, the audience did not seem to be able
to get enough of minstrelsy and mono
logue, and encores were frequent and
main-.
All the troths did a thriving business,
and mar.y of the tables looked dismally
empty lonj? bofore the close. However,
the pleasant Jingle of the treasury box did
much to recompense the deserted, inar

A large number of friends ol the hospi

assistant bartender in the Chicago saloon,
appeared before Judge Mogan yesterday
on a charge of disturbing the peace. He
was arrested about 2 o'clock yesterday
morning in the King House, on Fourth
street, for choking Kmma Brady. The
screams of the woman attracted the at
tention of Policemen Say and O'Shea and
they placed Edwards under arrest.
In Judge Mogan's court yesterday Ed
wards was particularly offensive in his
demeanor and declared to the arresting
officers that, he had a "pull" and could
beat the case. His conduct exasperated
the Judge and he convicted him and or
dered him into custody to appear for sen
tence to-morrow morning, when he will
get the full limit.

jvateh the scene; on innumerable children, girls
and boys ome on bicycles from school and
home to watch the startâ such is the back
irroiind of the scene at a meet of the San
Mateq hunt,
At one side of the field is the huntsman In
ho center of the pack, conferring, perhaps, with
he master of the hunt regarding some feature
if the day's run. while his assistants circle
ihout on their sl<*ek mounts, keeping the hounds
veil bunched by dexterous flipplnps of the six
oot thongs with which their crops are armed.
The hunters come up in groups of twos and
hrees, with perhaps a huntress or two among
henv exchanging greetings with each other
and vlth the ]n<l\f><> in the carriages. The men stem armed rap-a-ple
for the fray, or, rath-.-r, they louk as spick and si'an, ir. their low

caps, â white hunting stocks, short gray coats, white breeches and
riding boots, as If they had just stepped out of bo many bandhoxeÃ.
They are not in the traditional "pink" of the hunting field, but never
theless they present a very brave appearance. The ladles who ride
are in th usual dark, well-fitting riding-habit and silk hat. Now
and then one of them stops to adjust a strap here or a buckle there
as they move about In tho throng.
At last the time Is up, there will be no more waiting for
stragglers. The huntsman resigns his charge of the pack tr> the
master of the hunt and the whips, the horn â a mere little toy
trumpet, it looks â is sounded, and the impatient dogs, made the
more keen by an |xtra phort allowance of food, are off on the trail.
"They're off! They're off!" flies through the crowd, and those
who are to follow the hounds draw out from the throng and are
after them at a rattling pace â not too fast at first, however, for the
man who rides down a hound is a greater duffer in. the hunting field
than he who trumps his partner's ace at whist.
But soon the old hounds have found the scent, and giving voice,
off they go at a long, swinging pace, that soon leads the whole pack
out of danger from even the worst duffer that ever bestrode pigskin.
I streak off across the country in a scatterea mgnt, me
er of the hunt k'-pptng well to the fore with them, and
iound.of their yelps and barking makes pretty music in
till afternoon air.
hen follows a run that SPts the blood tingling. Across
temdow thpy gr,, with the hounds well ahead. A fence Is
fjnt, but. the .lops slip through It like water through a
. Now the foremost rider reaches It, and, tightening his
rein as the horse risen <m its haunches, he is borne easily Into the
air, down safely on the other Bide, and is off again, while the others
follow swiftly after In ;m Irregular string.
Then up the hill they go, slowing down a bit perhaps, but soon
catching up with the yelping hounds wh"n they reach a level stretch.
And bo they go, up hill and down dale, over grassy meadows, where
the stolid kine stare at them, and through patches of chaparraJ, in
which frightened rabbits scuttle out of their way. It Is hot work,
and of the dozen or more jumps on the run several are steep enough
to try a man's nerve If he is not sure of his horse and of himself.
Midway in the run they reach the "check," an appointed resting
place, where man and beast take breath and make ready for the
I ward run. The huntsman and his assistants kepp the hounds
in check till timp Is up, and then off thpy go for the finish.
This Is at some previously appointed place, and tbere axÂ« often
pight-seers there to
welcome the first
man in. As there 1h
no fox there is no
"brush" to win. The
dogs are rewarded
with hunks of meat,
odorous of the scent
they have been fol
lowing, but for the
human hunter there
is no tangible prize.
But he has his re
ward. Thirst and ap
petite are his in un
wonted measure, and
the tired hunters ad
journ to the house of
him that lives near-
est and there regale themselves with refreshments both potable and
edible. Then homo they go in time for a tub and change before
dinner, -which meal they attack with appetites worthy of haclcroods
men. This and sound sleep o" nights are the "cross-country rider's
reward.
Such is a run the San Mateo Hunt enjoys, weather permitting,
twice a week in the season, from the late autumn until summer
drives the members to mountain or the seashore. Sometimes, too,
they have extra runs on holidays. The start is made at a quarter
to four in the afternoon from the polo ground of the Burlingame Club,
from Laurel Creek, or from some other convenient locality. \They
make a run of from eight to twelve miles through the neighboring
hills, and are at home again in good season for the evening's meal
at seven.
The hounds with which they hunt, comprising some thirty couples,
were purchased for $5000 by Walter Scott Hobart some three years
ago from L. S. Howland of Washington, D. C, and are famous among
the 'cross-country riders of Washington, Baltimore and New York
as the Chevy Chase pack. When he bought them Mr. Hobart also
secured the services of J. S. Keating, the huntsman, who had been
ovet them for seven years past, and "Jerry" still has them in his
charge. At first Mr. Hobart took the pack out only when h-- had
guesta who wished to hunt, but some two years ago a number of

Qer\. JM. G. Butler of tha Cuban Evacuation Ccm-
mittze Sp3aks fcr the Arm :
IX regard to "The allegation that it Is proposed to continue thÂ»
military occupation of Cuba until in despair the Cubans â : c ; for
annexation," I will say I was not aware thai such an "allegation"
hnd been made, and that so far as my information goes there is no
foundation for it.
My understanding is the United States forces are there with :hÂ°
consent and approbation of the Cubans, to aid them In the pr<
tion of public order and the establishment of a "stable and durable
government" and for other purpos< b.
As to whether annexation is desired by the American p ople or
the Cubans there is no basis upon which an Intelligent answer can
be formulated. The American people have had no opportunity to ex
iâ¢â  opinion on the subject. My individual opinion is thai when
thoroughly informed they would desire the annexation of the Island,
in an orderly, legal manner. It would make om or two of the
wealthiest ard most prosperous States of the American Union.
Whether the Cubans desire- annexation it is equally difficult to give
a satisfactory answer.
There are three classes to be reoon< iled on this or any other
pr< position relating to the future of the island. They are: First,
rge property owners, professional, busi?:^:-. and manufacturing
classes, embracing Cubans and Spaniards. Second, what might be
termed the middle classes, embracing small farmers and manufac
. ar.d third, the laboring" classi s.
These may again be subdivided into the practical and sentimental
class* â¢

i" <:> pended on to do so, and I believe when the obligations and
onsibilities of a small, independent nation are fully realized these
v.'ill prefer and seek and alliance with the United States.
After we compelled Spain to relinquish her sovereignty we are
l li dg< <i to permit the Cubans to establish such a government as they
see fit â the [Jnited States authorities determining whether the gov
ernment thus established is of "stable and durable character." I
assume it must.be republican in form.
. If the Cubans set up such a government as can and will be reeng
nized by the nations of the earth, ours among the number, they ought
to be permitted to enjoy their independence as lon T as they choose
and are nble to do so. I do not believe, however, that any govern
ment ought to be permitted that Is likely to involve this government
in trouble with foreign nations, or imperil the safety and welfare of
our own people.
1 take it for granfed our troops will evacuate the island, when our
piedpes and obligations have been carried out, by simply withdrawing
them to our own shores. The tfme for evacuation will depend on the
Cubans themselves. When they have demonstrated their ability tor
overnment, and to manage their own affairs in an orderly, en
lightened manner, our troops should be withdrawn.
*: * *
Booker J. WasKir\Â£tor\ Sp, aks for the Southern
Negro :
MY general feeling Is that the Cubans ougtit to be left free to
govern themselves. They may make mistakes at first in their
attempts at self-government, as all people ar<> likely to do.
They may not reach an Anglo-Saxon standard of self-government,
but if they have a government suited to their climate ar.d conditions
it seems to me as if that was all we could expect of them.
Ir. bringing Cuba irto our American life we must bear in mind
that notwithstanding the fact that the Cubans^have certain elements
of paleness, they already Beem to have surpassed the United States
in solving the race problem, in that they seem to have no race prob
lem in Cuba. I wonder if it is quite fair to the white people and the
co'ored people in Cuba to bring them into our American conditions
and revive the race antagonism so that they will have to work out
anew the race problem which we are now trying to solve in this
country. I believe that r/e should give the Cubans our protection
and moral support and encouragement in every way possible.

BisKop OttCr Speaks for the Clergy f
THE question of the future of Cuba and of our relations to that
island would seem to belong to the domains of natural politics
and diplomacy, and as such to be foreign to those who do not
make these their profession. But, under our system of government,
all such questions rest, finally, for their decision, in the judgment of
the people, whose voice and vote ultimately determine policies and
choose those who are to execute them. Under these circumstance^ it
is, I suppose, in order for any citizen to express the hope that the
future policy of the United States will be In accordance with Its own
pledges and its own traditions. â¢ V
As to these there can be no doubt. We have explicitly declared
our purpose, in intervening between Spain and Cuba, to have been
to iintaln the right of the Cubans to be free, and to determine
their i vvn form of government. Whether, in their efforts to do this.
they proceed in accordance with our notions of what they ought to do,
Is an utterly irrelevant question. So long as they do not organize a
government hostile to us. it would Beem to be their business and not
ours to decide what and how they organize.

Any endeavor to coax, wheedle or coerce them Into being annexed
to the United States would be equally hypocritical and dishonest.
And this not only because of our pledges, but because of our tra
ditions. These have affirmed, from the beginning, when we appealed
for their vindication to the world, that a people whether strong or
weak, eastern or western, had a right to be free, and to determine
under what conditions their freedom should be exercised. L/et us not
give these traditions the lie.
True enough it is that other nations have made might to be right;
and, having interfered in behalf of the oppressed, have remained to
convert one form of involuntary servitude into another; freeing men's
bodies perhaps from the hand of the oppressor, but not their wills,
their lives, or their property from the coercion of an external rule.
If we can consent to this, then we tell the world that we do net
believe in our own principles; or rather, that we have no principles,
only expediencies.
For myself, I hope better things of the republic. I>t our stronger
hands lift Cuba to its feet, teach it how to stand alone and to rule
itself; and then â let us take them off! That would be an example
of majestic and self-restrained beneficence worthy of a great people.

mrnt to prolong, on some pretext, the military occupation of the
island of Cuba until the Cuban people, in despair of securing relief In
any other way,, ask for annexation.
The inland will be evacuated by the American troops as soon as
a stable government is established, but no sooner. Of course our
government must determine when the proper time has arrived.
Any intimation of intended bad faith on the part of the people
conns from irresponsible persons for the purpose of fomenting dis
cord for political effect, or other ulterior ends.
Viewing the matter from the standpoint of the American Investor
In Cuban properties, it is unquestionably best that pood faith in our
treatment of the Cubans should be scrupulously observed. So long
us a stable government of any kind is maintained in Cuba American
investors bave nothing to fear. The island can doubtless be developed
successfully under a free, recognized, stable Cuban government prob
ably as well as if under our own government, especially, as will be
the case, because it is under the protective care of our government.
Annexation may, however, sooner or later come. That, I think,
is an after question. I approve of letting the Cubans have the oppor
tunity of establishing tlv-ir own government, if possible, as promised
them. Tt may be after a large number of the American people have
mingled with the Cubans they may really want annexation. This
will be so if they are convinced that It is but for their welfare. That,
of course, remains to bo seen when the question comes up for decision.
The first steps looking toward the establishment of a stable gov
ernment in Cuba may be taken in -the near future. It may be a mat
ter of some years firpt.
In determining whether the time has come for evacuation, all
signs and conditions will, of course, be duly considered â such as the
conduct of the Cuban people in regard to law and order, the manner
and results of their elections, their respect for duly elected officials,
their Industry, etc. In short, the government should not and will not
pay any attention to the talk of self-appointed leaders or the threats
of excited Individuals, but face the problem in a broad spirit, havinff
in view all the th-^n existing conditions and circumstances.

bold a $50,000 Mir\e
for a Chromo
JAMES MORRISON, well known at
Juneau, is the owner of one of the
richesi claims on Hunker Creekâ No.
"'> below. He has twenty-four men
a 1 work, eight or ten holes down,
and the smoke from his fires at night
envelop* 9 the creek valley for a mile.
He was offered $40,000 for the claim by
J. J. Healy last winter, declined and has
been carrying on development ever since,
and his dumps are probably worth now
more than $50,000. Among the workmen
on the claim is old Tom Young, the man
who staked it.
Morrison came to Dawson in 1897 with
the intention of starting a saloon, but
finding rents so high and whisky so scarce
he decided to tend bar and weigh gold
for another man Instead. On the wall of
the saloon hung a large picture of a
â wood nymph which Morrison had brought
with him.
Among the patrons of the bar was Tom
Young, and he took a great fancy to this
picture. Young had been shut up in this
country for ten years, and to him thi3
particular chromo was a revelation in art.
Tom was then married to or was living
with a squaw, their home being a dingy
little cabin across the Klondike In what
was then an Indian village. But he
wanted to take that picture home to his
cabin and his squaw, and In exchange for
it he offered Morrison the claim No. 3'J,
Hunker. â¢;''â ' ;
Not much was known of Hunker at that
time. Although Discovery and some ad-
Joining claims away up had been turning
out rich dirt, few claims lower down had
been more than prospected. However,
Dick Low, the man who discovered the
â¢riches of Skookum's benches, had just at
that time paid $1000 for No. 40, and Mor
rison argued that If so wise or lucky a
man might risk so much money he (Mor
rison) could afford to chance so little as
a cheap chromo.
The trade of the picture for the- mine
was made and Tom carried the garish
thing away in great satisfaction, and Jim
went out to look at his purchase.
He let a couple of lays that samo year.
The layman found the pay streak. Jim

Wear\] Trials of the

THE new piano was brought up on
one of the very late boats, and ar
rived at Circle in good order about
the first week in September, bearing
on the box the address of the man
who kept the big saloon on the cor
ner of the front Btreet, in the same block
with the company stores.
Its adveni In camp crestted almost a hol

as his purchase probably was by the tlmÂ»
it reached him. For three days from the
hour the thing was pui up on the pedestal

silent.
The saloon-keeper's wife hammered nt
It most, but everybody In the town took
his turn, struck the chords he loved the
Bang his collection of "comics and
lls," and gave place to the next
Impresario on the keys.
On the night of the third day the place
was filled with men of the rough miner
sort, gathered In groups about the piano,
tlic big Btove, the faro bank and along
the bar. A few women were in the crowd
near the pi;ino, which was doing its
noisiest. The group at the faro bank was
quiet and absorbed, that at the bar was
trying In drunken fashion to keep along
with the song, the smoke-blue, atmos
phere quivering under the influence of
Just tell them that you saw me and
they will know the rest;
Just tell them that I'm looking well,
you know.
In the middle of thesong the pianist was
pulled off the stool, and the next man In
the long line waiting to get a whack at
the piano was pushed toward it. Though
it was the night of the. third day this
stranger had not yet taken his turn, al
though he had been a constant and impa

B drink or two more than previously. He

himself and struck the keys with both

with only a few preliminary chords he be
gan tO sing "The Holy City."
By any single voice I have not heard It
done betterâ a round, smooth, strong, cer
tain voice, that sang the song as it was
Intended it should be sung, with dignity
and power. It seemed to me, before the
slowly opening gates of the New Jenila
lem.
The first verse was not finished before
the faro dealer had stopped the game at
the faro bank, the bartender lifted his
finger to the man who had called for a
drink as a sign that he must wait, the

glasses suspended, the smoke arose and
wound Itself Blowly Into a blue circle over
the heads of the hushed and attentive
though half-drunken crowd. The singer
remained wrapped in his song to its fin-
Ish, slurring- not one note nor hurrying
one Interval. The light from the dirty and
ill-smelling coal oil lamps that hung
against and begrimed the walls even when
the curtain of tobacco smoke had risen to
ward the rafters could to those at tha
farther end of the room scarcely reveal
the Ringer and his piano on the pedestal
as he repeated the closing lines of the
song.
For the space of say one whole note in
terval the spell continued after the song
was finished. Then the singer rose., step
ped down and became one of the crowd
again. Ffe was treated as a discovery.
They had not known he could, sing, or at
least that he could sing that way.
The delighted crowd dragged him to the
bar, of course, but all the. expressions of
appreciation were comparatively subdued
and respectful, and there was nothing at
all of the kind that followed the first ren
dering of "Isabella" and "The New
Bully." The crowd drank to him, and
then they clamored for him to sing again.
But he said he would not, and he did
not; he .had sung more than he intended
to sing, and neither would he repeat this
or sing anything else, and he joined the
drinkers around the bar while another de
lighted miner pounded gleefully on the
keys of the wearied piano and roared out
his sons, "Oh, Tellum That You Saw
Me."

mained his body in the grimy little cabin.
From up and down the creek those who
had known him, hearing of his death,
gathered about it in great sorrow. The
death occurred in the evening and the
next morning the partners and two of the
men, who had born almost as close to
"the old man." started away for town,
carrying the body for burial In the city
cemetery. They had first drossed it as
neatly as the old man's "war sack" ad
mitted and then sewed it up in a white
plore of tenting, which they let extend
out beyond the head and feet, the surplus
serving as handles by which they could
swing the weight between them over their
shoulders. Only two of them could carry
the burden at one time, for the trail was
narrow, following tho side hill through
the trees and underbrush.
Down the Klondike in the spring of the
year, just after the overflow, tho banks
along which the trail runs are wet and
muddy and the labor of traveling over it
increases. All that afternoon the four
men struggled down toward town over
the terrible trail, climbing up and down
the muddy banks, constantly shifting the
burden from the shoulders of one to the
other, and as often drawing help from
the bottle, until it became a helpless bot
tle. Then they threw it into the river and
stumbled on toward town.
It was evening when they arrived there
very tired and very thirsty. They turned
In at the first saloon, set their burden on
the floor and had a long drink of old
Scotch. This was very reviving and they
had another. There were four In the
party and each must buy the liquor M
very tired were they and so glad to be
near the end of their journey. Then they
picked up the long bag, the contents of
which none in the saloon suspected, and
went into th* street. At the very next door
stood the big sign of a liquor saloon and
very cheerily one of the party ordered
the others In. Here they called for five
glasses and, lifting from the floor the
long sack, now covered and soaked with
nuid and slime, stood it against the bar.
one of them crying, "Mac, old man, here"*
ten thousand blessings on your soul."
The sack slid along the bar to the floor,
and the four In an effort to save It stum
bled and fell with it. Slowly they climbed
to their feet one by one and then united
in lifting the heavy lump,
"It's the first time I ever knew you to
turn away from old Scotch, Mac," said
one, "but you're off your liquor now,
and it's not we that are blaming you."
Slowly and unsteadily they Bwung the
sack between them again and lumbered
out of the door, the weight swinging
with their uncertain steps, striking heav
ily against the door posts and causing
the passers-by to give them a wide way
to avoid contact with its mud and slime.
They turned naturally into the next sa
loon, and from it went Into the next and
the next, all down the Front-street line,
the handling of their Burden and the
treatment of their dead guest becoming
in each more free and reckless. Tha
ghastly jest soon attracted a following,
and a crowd surrounded the four and
their queer charge, and went with them
from saloon to saloon, buying drinks In
their turn to heighten the effects, until
at last a squad of policemen broka
through the party, who, glasses in hand,
were at the time dancing a cancan about
the dirty bag as it was made to sit In Â»
chair at a Btud poker table.
The police took charga of. tha bods
(which was .afterward properly and with
all solemnity buried), and having: been

Standing Armies of the World
ThÂ© Czar's proposal to check the In
crease of armaments will probably die as
a mere pious intention. It was not with
out a subflavor of Irony, proceeding as it
did from a monarch who not only has
by far the largest army in the world, but
who was also busy increasing his navy
â when he made h's famous proposal.
Rut, though It Is hard to believe that
th<Â» millennium Ib to bo brougn. about by
n. Czar or that the reign of universal peace
will be founded by the master of the larg
est number of legions on earth, we are all
bound to recognize the fact that the Eu
ropean nations spend a terrible proportion
of their energies and their resources in
preparations for war. Though it may be
a.n exaggeration to say that Europe ia one
vast camn. there are something like four
millions of Its male Inhabitants constantly
under arms as soldiers or sailors even In
time of peace, and when It Is borne In
mind that all these have to be maintained
In non-productive work and supplied with
the mest costly appliances, some Idea may
be formed of the gigantic waste. The fol
lowing tables, compiled by St. Paul's, will
enable one to compare the armaments of
the leading nations:

jor General Leonard Wood, the present
military Governor of Santiago province,

This strange state of affairs is explained
thus wise:
â¢ a little more than two years ago
; General Wood was surgeon of the Fifth
ilar Infantryi with the rank of cap
. tain, and after he had left the service to
practice medicine In civil life at Washing
ton lie was remembered fondly by the en

j of athletics, especially football and wrest
: ling.
At the opening of the late war he was
appointed colonel of the Rough Riders,
and for gallant and efficient services ren
dered he earned his present tank and ap
pointment.
During the entire war the Fifth was the '
only regular, Infantry regiment that did I
not have a chance to see service, but after
the protocol had been signed and the

At Tuna, a few miles below Bradford,
Pa, is a well that has been drilling for
seventeen years. It Is owned by an ec
centric individual by the name of Mike
Miller and has already cost a small for
tune.
Miller is in reality a farmer, but a
large part of his time j^ occupied in
scraping together a few more dollars to
punch his "oil well" deeper into the
bowels of the earth. During these many
yems he has spent all his earnings in
drilling this deep well with the Idea of
somewhere in the hidden depths discover
ing a' lake of the oleaginous fluid which
will make him suddenly and independent
ly w< alth.
So much has been said of Miller's wild
venture that of late yoarw he has been
the subject of more or less public ridi
cule, and the subject of Mr. Miller's well
is not at all a pleasant one to Mrs. Mil
ler. In fact, Mrs. Miller has seen bo
many hard-earned dollars sink out of
sight, as it w< re. that mention of the well
is a sore subject,
The farmer's well is now down about
3400 feet, and drilling Is still going on.
Most of the work has been done by Mil
ler himself, assisted by a hired man. Re
cently he disposed of a part of his farm
for oil purposes and the money thus ac
quired explains the resumption of opera
tions. The well is now In a black sand
and has a showing of oil. which Is of
a very peculiar color, almost a purple.
It is understood that Miller has decided
to drill a little further, and, after shoot
ing the well, put it to pumping. If it
proves n paying producer It has been
thai ii:e peculiar formation be
. thi Miller sand.
What makes Miller more determined
than over to go on with his boring un
til he striker; oil Is the fact that only
recently Dr. E. A. Van Scoy has com
pleted a well that started off at the rate
of twenty-five barrels a day. This so
encouraged the farmer that directly he
heard of the doctor's find he rushed off
and obtained a mortgage on hia farm.
Since that time pumping operations have
been In progress day and night and lit

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, APRIL 16, 1899.
Special to Thp Sunday Call.
THE promise made by Nikola Tesla to the world some
two years ago that he would soon give it a means
of lighting its homes, its offices and its streets at
night time by "artificial daylight" has been fulfilled.
The invention has been entirely completed for
several weeks. A day or two ago the authoritative an-
rouncement was made that contracts have already been
signed with several New York business houses to equip
their business places with the new light at once. The
promoters of the company which Is pushing the new in
vention are so certain of its great practical utility that
they predict that it must soon supplant the arc lamp.
"Vacuum tube lighting by high frequency currents" is
â what Tesla himself calls it. The name, though clumsy.
Is sufficiently descriptive. The essential parts are a va
cuum tube, and a special current of high frequency, pro
duced by a special dynamo, of Tes'.a's invention. The
tubes," Mr. Tesla explains, "have had all the air pumped
out, but, of course, are full of ether. The passage of this
special current sets the other in motion, lorming light
waves. The light differs frem arc Illumination in that it
has no particular center. The whole tube glows and sheds
a radiance like daylight all around."
The tubes, of course, are sealed tight at both end;:. A
wire is made fast to one end. but there !s no wire inside.
The tubes at present in use are about a foot long. For
spe< lai purposes, such as studio illumination, street light
int,' and so <>n. they can be made any size up to a yard.
The glory and the beauty of them is that their light
goes all over the place to be illumined â is as strong in
the corners of a room as directly under the. tube. Hence
the truth of its name, artificial daylight. A hinted tube
in a room has exactly the effect of daylight flooding the
windows. Notwithstanding the tube itself is not trying
to the eyes. You may look steadily at it, with no evil
effects whatever.

ALCOHOL
TO BE THE
NATIONALIGHT
OF FRANCE.
PARIS. April 10.â Alcohol is about
to supersede petroleum, not only iA
France, but in all Europe. It is
not only to supersede petroleum,
but it promises to take the place
of coal itself.
Houses are to be heated by n'cohol and
engines are to be driven by alcohol. As
fur alcohol lighting it is already an ac
complished fact. The Emperor of Ger
many has had the palace at Potsdam and
the Tb.lergar.ten at Berlin supplied with
incandescent alcohol Inmps, while thp new
French President, Loubet, Is lighting up
the court' aid of the Ely see with these
same extraordinary novelties of the hour.
Both the agricultural and industrial
worlds are In excitement. Chambers of
Commerce and Farmers' clubs are hear
ing lectures on the new discoveries.
Never, perhaps, has such important fis
cal legislation been accomplished in both
France and Germany In so short a time
taking off the last tax and obstruction
as that â almost accomplished â which
is taking oft the last tax and obstruction
from the free manufacture and sale of
Industrial or denaturlzed alcohols. The
distiller Is at last to work for the good of
humanity. His friend, the farmer, is at
last to get a share of the good things of
progress.
The significance of this new movement
to the world at large is concealed, so to
speak, in the peculiar legislation which
is everywhere applied to alcohol. All the
discoveries and inventions imaginable
must He helpless until the iron heel of
the internal revenue tax is removed from
this peculiar product. Alcohol is not dear
in itself. M. G. Araeheouesne, secretary
general of the new Association pour
I'Kmploi Industrie! de l'Alcool â the great
league of distillers which in France is
engineering the affairâ has just been tell
ing me that a few years ago in Cuba he
made alcohol out of refuse molasses at
an expense of less than 9 francs the 100
liters. As a liter Is considerably more
than a quart, this would amount to G'i
cents a gallon. It was only done as an
experiment, partly to find out what to do
with the waste molasses. The alcohol
rould not be exported in sufficient quan
tities to other countries because of the
taxes. "It is the same in Louisiana," said
M. Arachequesne, "where the refuse mo
lasses Is dumped into the sea. And you
can imagine something of the condition
of France and Germanyâ two countries
which have no petroleum of th^ir own
by casting a glance at the dilemma of
the beet sugar agriculturists of Cali
fornia, Nebraska and Utah, forced to
hum their waste molasses, at an actual
expense. There is no other way to get
rid of a superfluity, which cannot be sim
ply thrown away for fear of creating a
nuisance. In all those States," continued
M. Arachequesne, "where they have
tried beet sugar raising, successfully or
unsuccessfully, California, Kansas. Min
nesota, Nebraska, Utah, Colorado and
Virginia, it is a hardship to the farmer
that he is not allowed to distill industrial
alcohol from this waste material. But if
this is a hardship, how much greater, In
view of these new inventions and discov
eries, must be the lot of the American
farmer with millions of bushels of Indian

cent for illumination. And this brings us to a second long
advantage of the vacuum tube. It never grows hot. You
may touch the glass an hour after the light is turned on
and find it as cool as when first lighted. An electric bulb
in like case is hot enough to scorch, not to mention giving
headaches to the luckless mortals who happen to Bit di
rectly underneath or beside it.
The tubes can be attached to the electric light fixtures
In common use, but cannot be illumined by the ordinary
current. Or rathpr they can be made to glow with it, but
the process is too costly. That was one thing that made
the wise men doubtful in the beginning. A few of them
thought Tesia might probably perfect his light process,
but were firm in the belief that it would remain too costly
for commercial use.
Tesla's new dynamo has changed all that. Contracts
now signed insure that several important structures in
New York city will be < quipped with the new light.
There can bo no doubt that it will rapidly supplant
other methods of illumination as soon as moneyed men
build ard operate high frequency current stations. The
first cost of wires, tubes, etc., is about the same as for
incandescent lighting, hut the tubes have the very great
virtue of not burning; out after the manner of incandescent
globes or carbon pencils, hence the cost of operation will
be very much less.
When it comes to use there is simply no comparison
Possible. It is just the same as having a day twenty-four
hours lon'i. Everywhere, for every purpose, artificial day
light equals th â¢ I* al thing.
Witness this picture of the inventor's hand. The pho
tograph for it nas made at midnight, in his laboratory,
with B two-v?cotd exposure. It was not only taken, but
printed by the artificial daylight, yet it will be seen that
it shows clearly the line* of the palm and the texture of
cuff and Bleeve.
Nothing remains r-nw but to equip the world with
pronei wires, dynamos, r>nd so on. Men with money know
a good thing when they see it, ever without artificial
daylight, so it is very Hkery th:it in a matter of twelve
months there will l> â  practically no night in any con
siderable city of the world.

corn that he often I'm. ls impossible to
sell?" The conclusion Of this expert is
that sooner or later the United States
must fn 11 in line with the new European
legislation.
France, a country utterly without petro
leura and Importing coal enormously, sees
nothing less than her agricultural salva
tion in the new use of alcohol. For years
they have been seeking in vain for the
"national light" and the "national fuel."
For years, on the other hand, the farm
ers have been struggling sullenly against
the internal revenue laws. From beet
root, from potatoes and f rr m divers other
products they have sought to gain a profit
which they think ought to lie theirs. All
France may be compared to a great
moonshine whisky district, watched at
immense expense, whore frauds and un
derstandings tÂ«ke the place of violent re
sistance of authority. The French farmer
knows all about alcohol. He wants to be
his own distiller, lie wants to make a
double profit on his products, to have
winter work for his sons, his daughters
and his hired help. For long years the
result has been a gradual letting down
of barriers against alcoholic drinks in
France, until to-day In Paris you can
have a satisfying slug of absinthe for 2
cents.
Naturally the secretary general of
the Association Pour l'Emplol In
dustriel de l'Alcool is proud of
his mission. To at once satisfy
the farmers and the distillers and give to
France her long-sought national light and
fuelâ all in removing a great stumbling
block of morality and hygieneâ ls a task
to be proud of. "Let Frenchmen make
alcohol as they never made It before." M.
Arachequesne has cried to the breathless
ly interested Chamber of Deputies; "let
France distill a hundred liters where she
distills one to-dayâ but not to drink. The
time has come. France will have alcohol
to burn."
One of the chief factors In the new use
of alcoholâ and there are manyâ will un
doubtedly turn out to be the carburant of
M. Dusart. In saying this I am not quot
ing M. Arachequesne. who In hie delicate
official capacity Is not likely to favor one
invention over another. As everybody
knows, alcohol when burning disengages
heat rather than light.
It burns a dull blue. The carburant ia
nothing less than a substance which,
when mixed with it, Induces alcohol to
give out a light of great Intensity and
beauty. At the same time it has the
precious quality of obviating every dan
ger of explosion. It Is this latter virtue
that is to make carburated alcohol a safe,
odorless, clean, economical and energetic
fuel and motive power substance. What
the Dusart carburant is nobody knows.
M. Dusart Is at present keeping the se
cret. All that can be said at present Is
that when the carburant is added to the
ordinary industrial or methylated alcohol
It changes Its color, which in France is
green, to a dark yellow. A light sediment
is rapidly precipitated, leaving a limpid
yellow mixture that is easily decanted.
This sediment is Imagined at present to
be nothing more than a disengaging of
the artificial coloring matter w/hich the
French law decrees for all industrial al
cohols. The carburant, unhappily, does
not remove the disgusting odor which the
present excise regulations also prescribe.
This, however, is a minor matter, as
methylene, to which the infect smell is
due, has now but a short course to run as
a "denaturlzer."
Tt is claimed for Dusart's carburant
that it is :\'i per cent cheaper than alcohol
itself. In this case carburated alcohol
will always be cheaper than other. While
then is none of this compound substance
as yet nn the market, it is promised to be
retailed within a month at .15 centimes the
litfr. in Paris itself, a trille less than 11
cents the quart. In Paris headlight oil
(petrole de luxe), a rather inferior prod
uct, not properly refined, retails at 12
cents and 14 c<nts the quart.
The Dusart lamps resemble ordinary
petroleum lamps, with wicks uiul chim
neys. The carbureted alcohol does not
burn by generating gas and there is no
danger of explosion. Were it not for the
softness and brilliancy of the light you
might imagine you wore burning bead
light oil. There is no sweating, no smoke
or odor either during or after combus
tion, and the lighting is Instantaneous.
The wicks never burn, so they need no
trimming. I was present at some of M.
Arachequesne's experiments with the pho
tometre, when exact comparisons were
made between petroleum and Dusart
lamps of equal power. With a slender
student lamp chimney the Dusart lamp
gave a light of LO3 carcel at an expense
of 65 grammes of carburated alcohol per
hour, and with a chimney bellied around
the flame a light of L 32 carcel at an ex
pense of SI grammes. The petroleum lamp,
fed with the most expensive head-light
oil, gave a light of 1.26 carcel at an ex
pense of 56 grammes of petroleum per
hour. After making all corrections of
density the results appear to be about
equal.
The experiment was nevertheless held
to be unsatisfactory, in spite of the su
perior softness and beauty of the alcohol
lamp's light and its advantages of clean
liness. With 95 degrees alcohol, which
gives the Denayrouze incandescent lamps
an extra economy of 25 per cent, the bril
liance of the Dusart light would have
been that much augmented. Unfortunate
ly the French excise regulations do not
yet permit the use of 95 degrees alcohol.
A new "de-naturante" also, something
else than methylene, or woodspirits, will
also have to be permitted, both for the
sake of economy and lighting power. The
methvlene now mixed with alcohol. In or
der to prevent it being "revitalized" and
rectified for drinking, is a great hindrance
to the Dusart lamps, as is also the water
used to bring all French Industrial alco
hols down to 90 degrees. These are some
of the last legislative and administrative
barriers that are now being broken down
In France. The Germans, it is said, are
far in advance. They have their own
carburant and lamps similar to those of
the Dusart system. Burning alcohol is
now retailed in Berlin at 7 cents per
quart, and carburated alcohol at W de
grees will soon be retailed at 6 cents per
quart. I'ndoubtedly the domestic petro
leum lamp is seeing Its last days in Eu-
rope.
In Paris by far the greatest sensation
lias b^pn made by the Incandescent De
nayrouze lamps, with which Rf. Loubet Is
now lighting up the courtyard of the
Elysee. It ia the incandescent system
that is also used at Potsdam and in the
Berlin Thiergarten.

READING OF THE HAND.
_ _ >ITH a hand so liberally endowed with all the essential qualities, Tesla
111 fOUlr ' not ue l ess tban -famous. His phenomenally strong fate line would
111 give promise of an exceptional careerâ one where the Inventor not only
VAy wins honors, but can make a financial success of his undertakings.
His hand embodies all the salient points of the conic or artistic type,
with the scientific or Inventive, as Indicated by the breadth at the base of the
hand and the well-defined lines on the Mount of Mercury. His tapering fingers
lend artistic beauty to his inventive genius. His long third finger gives him
enough of a speculative spirit to enable him to "launch out into the deep" and
grasp the slightest straw which might develop Into something tangible. Yet
his head line, keeping a normal course and following his life line so closely,
would indicate his caution and his disposition to submit all things to reason.
His head lino, rising slightly under the Mount of the Sun, would point more
clearly to great fame and, with the added triangle upon the line, to great distinc
tion and public honors, ills head line, not drooping to the Mount of the Moon,
would preserve him from the defect of most inventive geniusesâ he would not be
come visionary. Everything must bn practical to appeal to him. This Is also
borne out in his continuous Girdle of Venus, which gives inspiration and enthu
siasm. He is capable of rising to the greatest pitch of enthusiasm, yet the square
palm and level head line would never allow him to become a dreairwr. He has,
to be sure, a high appreciation of the fine arts; but after all It Is the natural he
desires and will have. He has enough commercial ability to protect his own In
terests.
He is changeable in moods, quick to take offense, and has a tendency to
lapse into periods of gloom, because of his tendency to plan far beyond his
power to execute.
While he is developing or materializing one invention he is planning and ar
ranging in his mind something entirely different from the work on hand. And
yet he has the ability to keep all in order and never allows one plan to inter
fort- with another. He has great powers of concentration and the long second
phalanx of the thumb would cause him to submit all to a careful analysis and ar
rive at n logical conclusion before acting upon a matter of importance. He has
a forceful, energetic temperament, possessing all of the desirable qualities of an
artistic nature with scientific and commercial ability.
Vie has a Latin thumb, which endows him with intellect and refinement. In
the attainment of a desire or the carrying out of a plan he would use the ptregth
of Intellectual will as opposed to that of brute force. Yet he is a man who would
brook no opposition and would be inclined to be aggressive when an important
matter was under consideration. It would not be easy to manage or control such
a nature. He is generous and frank with those who win his confidence. He is
adaptable to places and people and really prefers a bohemian existence, as shown
by the position of the fourth finger. He has great diplomacy and tact In his
management of people, using quiet but determined methods. He is one whoso
nature is so highly organized that he cannot endure discord of any kind. He
would sacrifice a good deal for peace and the lines show plainly that his life baa
not been on-? uninterrupted harmonious existence. In his early career he met with
somo opposition; the influence of relatives played quite a part In his early lifo.
One influence especially (as indicated by the downward branch of the heart lino)
caused his sorrow.
Tesla is a man of deep affection, loving more from the Imagination than
from the senses, and one who has been disappointed by his idol falling far short
of his estimate. He has the highest type of affection, the pride and worship of
the heart's ideal, and an equal ambition that the woman of his choice shall be
great, noble and sincere.
He has great determination, perseverance, patience and keen perception. He
will start upon a new lino of work at 45 and Invent something which will startle
the entire world. It will be five years before it will be fully matured, owing to a
period of illness, which for a time will interfere with his progress. The illness
will be in the form of nervous exhaustion, as shown by the' large downward
branch from the line of life. He will recover, however, and win his choicest
laurels after that, as shown by the fate line doubling itself. From that time
on he will have great wealth and the highest honors conferred upon him
He will end his life far from his native country.
Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo
LONDON, April 7.â Charles Hills
Wells, "the man who hroke the
bank at Monte Carlo," one of the
most accomplished swindlers in the
world, was released from Portland
Convict Prison ln England last
week. He was sentenced in 1593 to seven
years' penal servitude for obtaining $150,
--000 on false pretenses.
Eight years ago the whole world was
talking and singing songs about the luck
of "The Man Who Broke the Bank of
Monte Carlo."
Wells' phenomenal winning began in
IR9I. In July of that year he is said to
have won $160,000, and in the following
November $140,000 more. On one night in
November he broke the bank live times
and won $50,000. Casino frequenters gave
him the name of "Bonne-Chance" Wells.
"Good Luck" Wells that means.
Wells claimed to have an Infallible sys
tem. To operate with it a capital of $30.
--000 was required. Its chief point was to
catch "runs" or "series" and then bet the
minimum stakes of 5000 francs, or the
maximum stakes of ]2,000 francs. With
luck against him he bet the minimum
stakes. In following this system on one
occasion he took all the 100 and all the 1000
franc bank notes supplied to the trente et
quarante table, and the croupiers had to
pay one deal in small notes and go-Id
pieces until the cashier had brought an
other $20,000 to the table.
He insured himself against the bank's
odd chance or "refalt" 1 by setting aside a
special fund of 1 per cent on his stakes.
This cost him JoOOO a day.
Wells lived in London, and every day
he sent his winnings to his IVndon bank
ers. Whenever he encountered a period
of ill luck he went home to England for a
season.
At play he was quick and cnol. Win
ning or losing, lie never lost his head.
At the height of his success he bought
a yacht of 2000 tonsâ the Palais Royalâ
and fitted it out most luxuriously. Its ap
pointments were superb. Four head
stewards attended to the comforts of the
gambler's guests.
All the time that Wells was winning at
play he was engaged in gigantic swind
ling operations. Finally Labouchere of

London Truth exposed him. When hÂ»
was examined in the Bow street Court h's
total Pt^alinps were estimated at JISO.OOO.
This included $90,000 from Miss Mary
Phillmore of London, and $45,000 from
the Hon. "U'illiam French of Ireland.
His method was simple. He represent
ed that he had taken out valuable patents
and invited Investors to assist him in de
veloping them. On his trial it was shown
that for years he had been taking out
provisional protections on all kinds of
absurd Inventions. Floating anchors,
sunshades, fog horns and hot air motors
for obtaining power from thr- heat con
tained in waste steam were some of his
alleged patents.
He was so plausible in his methods and
promises that his victims were many.
When his swindling was discovered h*
fled on his yacht, intending to land at
Portugal. On his way he stopped at
Havre to sell 300 tons of surplus coal. He
was arrested there, returned to England,
convicted and sentenced to the term of
imprisonment which he has just con
cluded.
There are fewer marriages in propor
tion to population than formerly fami
lies are smaller; they are less coherent
they are less lasting. i n England the
marriage rate fell from 17.2 per cent in
1851 to 15.2 per cent in ISSI. and from 1573
to ISSS the ages of men and women
married rose respectively from 25 6 -md
24.2 to 26.3 and 24.7. The rise the num
ber of divorces, IS6O-S5, was universal. In
S7l ,n^ n f and nd Wales show one divorce
to 1020.4 marriages; in 1579. one in 480.53.
From 1867 to ISS6 divorces i n the United
States increased 157 per cent, while the
population increased 60 per cent
One of the causes of change' Is the
whole modern movement of liberation
of subjects from sovereigns, slaves from
masters, wives from husbands and chil
dren from parents. Another is the disap
pearance of the ecclesiastical view of
marriage.
A more special cause has been the
growth of large cities, which completeiy
alter the environment of the organism
e! \vJ"T COme less dependent on women
for their home needs, and women have
resources and interests which the simplÂ«
life of the country denies them.â JournalSpecial to the Sunday Call.

HANNA IN HIS BUSY WASHINGTON LIFE
THE most overworked piece of
mechanism In ;ill Washington is
Senator Hanr.i's doorbell. Scarce
ly b day passes that it ls_not set
ringing ai least 150 times, and of ton
and ;ik;> in between breakfast and
bedtime it announces the arrival of the
two-hundredth caller. No man in Wash
ington, except the President, receives as
ninny callers.
Senator Hanna's abiding pace in
Washington is the Arlington Hotel, and
his rooms arc <,n the ground lioor of an
annex which was once a private house.
A colored man in the livery of a hotel
is appointed to guard the street door, and
of the ten score callers whose cards he
receives every day not more than fifty
<>r seventy-ftve succeed in obtaining an
audience. Many call, but few are chosen.
To give heed to,the speech of even fifty
persons in one day. however, is no sm.ill
thing. Only a man trained as Senator
Hanna has been from boyhood in busi
ness methods and endowed with a re
markable executive ability could accom
plish it. It is the penalty of i,eing In the
confidence of a President, for Senator
Hanna is nearer President McKinley than
any other man in the land.
Senator Hanna is a business man, first,
last and always. He is politic In busi
ness, businesslike in politics. He exacts
players was responsible.
The game was played on a small table at
the end of the cage nearest the door,
which was left ajar to facilitate the re
troat of the players should occasion arise.
' One player insisted upon being provided
with a stool during the game, and his In
sistence cost a very severe price.
During the play, which had then lasted
about ten minutes, an ekU rly lion had
emitted sundry loud protests against the
Intruders remaining, and one moment.
when the trainer, who for want of space
In the cage remained without, turned his
eves away from the beasts, the angry old
lion made a rush at the players, and. with
the assistance "f his two fellows, who only
wanted or walte* a hint from their elder.
mauled tfie unfortunate young men in the
most horrible mncii^r before they could
escape by the door, which became lixed
owing to" the legs of the stool getting be
twiÂ«en the bars.
Eventually the door was opened and the
two men dragged nut. bleeding and sense
lrss. So severely was one injured that
his life was at first despaired of, and he
wns Invalided for fr.ur months, and re
mains maimed for life.
It wai years before this fraud was dis
covered and exposed, bo that now It is
only a simple amusement.
Speaking of being conscious of a
ghoÃt's presence suggests mention of a
novel contrivance patented by an Eng
lishman, who is evidently a spiritualist.
It Is a sort of small room, or large box,
specially constructed for seeing spirft*.
As everybody knows, phantoms are rare
ly seen in bright light, the reason being
that it Is so strong as to shine clear
through them, and is not reflected from
their surface bo as to make them viÃi
ble. In the room described, however, the
light Is filtered through a blue liquid and
any spirits that happen to be present are
sure to be palpable to -he eye. The room
1s windowless; its walls are covered with
a peculiar paint of magnesia and tur
pentine, and all air Is shut out, a breath
ing supply being furnished from a tank
of compressed oxygen.
The magicianÃ of old made a specialty
of Bpecters, and their skill in summoning
the shades of the departed Is a matter of
record as far back as history goes. In
this business they are imitated by mod
ern wonder workers, who pretend to no
supernatural powers, depending upon rec
ognized principles of optics for the pro
duction of their phenomena. Among the
latter none is more astonishing to those
unacquainted with the modus operandl
than the exhibition which, as presented
on the stage, goes very appropriately by
the name of Black Art. It is rarely" of
fered, for the roason that the setting of
the display is expensive, but in wonder
exciting quality It is unrivaled.
In Black Art the entire stage Is lined
with black cloth, while all around the
front of it. at top, bottom and sides, is
a line of brilliant electric lights. Th.es>;
lights dazzle the eyes of the audience and
throw Into dense gloom the stage behind,
whereon the magician presently appear*
clad in a snow white suit. He waves his
hand and there comes floating in the air
a white wand, which he clutches. A wave
of the wand and a table appears on his
right: another wave and another table on
his left. Again, and two large vases are
seen upon the tablrs; they are shown to be
empty. The magician drops into one of
the vases a few orange seeds. A wave of
the wand, and the receptacle is filled with
oranses, which, on being poured into the
second vase, disappear.
A human skeleton suddenly arrive? and
begins to dance; It becomes dismembered,
the separated parts floating: about; but
presently they .loln company again and
the dance 1? renewed. Next, a white rab
bit is seen In one of the vases, from which
It Is takon by the performer, and In his
hands It becomes two rabbits, which are
tossed Into the air and disappear. The
explanation of the mystery Is that an un
seen assistant Is on the stage all the time.

NEWSPAPER SPECIALLY FOR BEGGARS.
AMONG the manifold and curious
Droductions which emanate from the
French press ia a paper called the
Mendicants' Journal. This perlodi
:al is published bi-weekly and is ed
ited and printed in a smart style.
It does not concern Itself with either re
ligion, drama, affairs of the Senate, or the
world of books, but caters wholly and in
geniously for its numerous and sagacious
readers.
It is practically published In the Inter
est of professional beggars, and contains
many curious advertisements, under
stood only by this section of the com
munity. We append a few of these adver
tisements culled from a recent number
of this uniaue. lournal:
"At 3 o'clock to-morrow a fashionable
funeral is to be celebrated at the Church
of St. Angelo."
"On Saturday next, at noon, the wed
ding of a wealthy gentleman will take
place at the Catholic Cathedral."
"A vacancy has occurred for a blind
man who can play the violin. Collection*
business methodÃ from all with whom
he comes in contact. With none of his
callers does he waste either time or
words. Nothing pleases him more than
a direct, concise and to the point state
ment of a case; but his official, political
face is the face, of a sphinx. Not a line
nor a muscle of it ever betrays what he
is thinking, nor an expression ever tells
whether he is pleased or displeased. He
is an unerring judge of men, and when
he thinks a man worthy of confidence he
is unreservedly communicative; but with
his average caller he is as unresponsive
as a graven image.
Although he accomplishes a great deal
in a day. Senator Hanna Is not a me
thooiCal man. He has no fixed plan of
dany life. He is not an early riser. He
breakfasts at 9. and breakfast is to him
the chief meal of the day, for he says
that he does not feel that the day is
properly begun unless ne has breakfasted
well. His morning meal is a hearty one,
and soft boiled eggs are an invariable
Item on his bill of fare. He has always
been blessed with a fair appetite, and al
though ny no means an epicure, he is fond
of good living. He likes sweets. Coffee
he drinks sparingly, and in regard to al
coholic liquors he is exceedingly abstem
ious. He is very fond of a good cigar,
but smokes only moderately.
Immediately after breakfast he returns
to liis reception rocm and callers are ad
mitted. Some of them are the charac
teristic office seekers of the capital.
Some of them come to him on matters
connected v/ith the National Republican
Committee, of which he has been chair
man since 1896. Some of them call be
cause they fancy that to have the ear
of the Ohio Senator is to have the ear of
the man in the White House, a long
stone's throw across the park. Some of
them have business with him which con
cerns some one of the almost Innumerable
commercial enterprisesâ shipbuilding, lake
carrying, banking, railroading, mining
and what notâ in which he is interested,
and some of them come to him for rea
sons whfch few who know Mr. Hanna
only as a skillful and determined politi
cian ever guess. His friends say that 1 c
is one of the most open-handed and char
itable of men, and that he never turns a
deaf ear to any honest story of suffer
ing. He has been an active member of
a number of c.-aritaJile organizations,
and his private charities are carried on
without regard to society or creed.
At 11:30 he drives to the Capitol. He
enjoys thoroughly the part of the day
and a black velvet mask he Is Invisible
to the audience. The oranges are poured
â¢nto the vase from a black velvet bap by
the assistant, and they vanish when he
empties them again into the sack. It 13
the same way with the rabbits, which are
caught in the open mouth of the bag wh'-n
they are tossed up. The skeleton Is of
papier mache painted white and fastened
upon thin board sawed to shape and cov
ered with black velvet, one arm and one
leg being jointed so as to be easily re
moved. The tables and vases are white
and like tlie skeleton are' made to appear
by removing their black coverings.
A most interesting method of producing
spectra! effects by the use of X rays la
described by Hopkins in his recently pub
lished work on "Magic." On the stage
is ceen a man seated at a table dining
composedly. The stage Is suddenly dark
ened, causing the man to disappear from
view, but at tho same moment a skeleton
appears sitting on the opposite side of the
tableâ a most unpleasant companion, one
would think. Of this strnnpe phenome
non the explanation is simply that the
skeleton Is painted with zinc Pulphlde,
which has the property of becoming lum
inous under the Rn^ntpen rays. The appa
ratus for producing fhe latter Is concealed
and the rays are communicated to Brud
der Bones through the body actually of
the living man at tho table. By the same
means the decanter and dishes on the
table are caused to plow brilliantly. The
skeleton is concealed by a black velvet
cloth at first while the stage is illumin
ated.
Ffopklns, to whose recently published
work -the writer Is much Indebted, speaks
6f a contrivance of mirrors by whicli an
empty suit of armor, previously taken to
pieces In the BlgTit of the audience by a
servant who Is supposed to be cleaning
It, is made to take life apparently and
chase the man around the room, beating
him. The place of the suit of armor, from
the spectators' viewpoint, is taken by a
reflection of another just like It, while a
man gets into the original suit. The army
cf demons and ghosts which pass over
the stage in "Der Freischutz" are painted
on a canvas roll and projected by a pow
erful light upon a scene representing
clouds.
Many patents have been granted for ar
rangements of mirrors designed to pro
duce a labyrinthine maze, and sonic of
them are very Ingenious. In one of these
iho entering spectator sees at a distance
a strange looking old woman. On ap
proaching he finds that she Is only a re
flection. Turning round to get Bight of
the original he sees the woman directly
at his left and much nearer. Approaching
he again finds himself before a mirror.
Whichever way he tries to get to the
woman he Is baffled. A sheet of plain
glass obstructs the real path to her, but
behind the glass is another mirror which
shows only her reflection. Any visitor in
any part of the maze is seen reflected in
every other part, bo that, the place seems
to be enormoui in extent and filled with
people.

Those who have visited seaside resorts
in France must be well aware of the nu

such places. They are apparently suffer

eral sympathy and draw large Incomes.
In reality most of them are clever impos

Almost the only public address of his on
record Is the one he made In Chicago,
during the last Presidential campaign. It
was brief, forceful and unadorned. Sena
tor Hanna's work in the Senate is done
in the committee rooms, and not on the
floor of the Senate chamber. He makes
other men uo his talking for him. lie
prefers to be the power behind the throne.
In comparison with Senate orators, with
Senator Wolcott, for example, Senat<^
Hanna Is as the engineer, deep in the
bowels of a man-of-war, to the gold-laced
captain on the bridge. ..<* does not seek
for applause, and he cares not a rap for
criticism. He knows exactly what he
wants, and as he never changes his mind,
never loses his nerve and never gives up,
he always gains his point in the end.
He reaches home after his day in the
Senate only In time to dine. After din
ner he has usually some social engage
ment, for he is undisguisedly tond of so
ciety. He is fond of tne theater, and en
joys the lighter operas. In Cleveland he
is owner of the opera house, which is a
pet hobby or his. He gives it a great
deal of attention, and all its bookings
are subject to his approval. When he is
in Cleveland he never fans to appear at
the theater with ivirs. Hanna every Mon
day evening.
For books he has no great liking. In
the days when he wa3 not quite so busy
he used to read a great many light nov
els for relaxation. Now he finds time for
nothing but the newspapers, of which he
reads a great many, and a few of the
magazines. He is extremely fond of
whist and plays exceedingly well. For
horses he does not care at all. He takes
no interest in outdoor sports. He does
not fish nor hunt - or play golf, but does
like yachting. Travel is a rest and re
laxation to him, and the trip he made
last year to the Yellowstone delighted
him so much that he proposes to repeat
it as soon as he can spare the time.
He is a vestryman in the Episcopal
church, although he is not a member of
any denomination.
Mrs. Hanna says that he has hut one
hobby, and that is the entertaining of his
friends. The hanna home, Glenmere. is
only four miles from Cleveland, on a high
bluff overlooking the lake. The name is
one; the Senator had a share in choos
ing, fop ho said he wanted a name that
meant something, and in the eight acres
of his grounds there is a glen suflici^nt
to justify the first half of the name.

up to his patch this afternoon. Found

"Poor old Earl. Give that whisky a

The two men puffed at their pipes for

said:
"Done anything at the store to-day?"
"You bet. Sold, all the. whisky I had.

Mrs. Roe â Oh, wellâ i ecause anything we

Miss Smithâ Ladies, there seems to be

resolutions, Brown Is wait-
Ing in the libraryâ she thought
you might like to question her in
regard to her motives in introduc
ing them. Suppose we ask her to
tell us her views?
Mrs. Tarboxâ Very well. Only, my mind
is made up. (The otners assent.
Miss Smith leaves the room and
returns with Miss Brown.)
Mrs. Robblnsâ At the request of the direc
tory, Miss Brown, will you ex
plain your reason for introducing
the resolutions?
Miss Brownâ The principal one was a de
sire to help those unfortunate
women. A man may maintain
that he has the right to em
ploy whom he "chooses. When,
however, he discharges his em
ployes, through no fault of theirs
and from a purely selfish motive,
he is guilty of an act which
merits ' universal condemnation.
Mrs. 'Roe â Most of those women are
Catholics, lam told. This makes
the question come under the head

"I'm off for San Pedro to-morrow. I

"How are you groins? In a balloon?"
"Foot it. \ suppose, but I'm g;olng."
"Going to leave me stranded here with

"No. fou're coming too."

Fugard handed a note to his companion.
It ran as folows:

The young man kept his eyes fixed on
Mrs. Robblnsâ l am quite convinced that
their belief concerns no one but
themselves. Surely, you will all
agree with me In dismissing the
objection just made?
(The others smile. iurs. Roe perceives
her mistake and decides to smile with the
majority).
Mrs. Tarboxâ Butâ lf their employer is a
â¢ candidate for the Presidency and
dismisses them, oecause they
have no votes, then It's political:
and. we should be going against
the constitution if we took it up.
Mrs. Gove â I cannot see anything politi

this note for a long time. and. when at
length he spoke, It was with twitching
lip and unsteady voice.
"What a queer cliap you are, George,
bottling this thing up! Why did you
do It?"
"Because, young 'mi"- and Fugard put
a kindly hand on his friend's shoulderâ
"because I don't see the way out. andâ
well, you've kicked yourself enough over
the wretched business. Poor old Percy!
It ain't all jam being a swindling com

"But I swear, George "
"Yes, yes. We know all about that.

"On my honor, George, I didn't "
"You didn't know. All right, all right;

didn't, indeed. Well. well, never mind.
No, no you're not to blame, sonny. You

Here, take Borne whisky; ought to be
ashamed of yourself. Wish T could snivel
like that, though; must be relieving.
What was that? Santa Claus knocking
at the door, by Jove!" and Fugard. giv
ing his friend a final kindly pat on the
shoulder, walked to the outside door, and,
opening It, let a flood of daylight and a
cloud of wind-blown sand into the room.
A stern-faced, well-dressed man stood
on the doorstep, and close by was a
spring wagon with its wheels burled half
way up to the hubs in the flue white sand
of the sandhill on which the company's
office stood.
"Is this the city of San Pablo?" asked
the stranger.
"That's what. This and that shanty
over there," answered Fugard. "A bit
sandy, Isn't it?" he added, as a sudden
cloud of snnd blinded the stranger's eyes.
"And is that the hay?" psbod thÂ« â¢ Â«â¢Â«â¢â¢
comer when he could see again, pointing
to a vast expanse of sanduariK: uisei \ â 
by a narrow channel of water and
stretching miles and miles to a distant
line of sea.
"That'R what," answered Fugard again.
"Thank you. Here is my card, and I
want to see Mr. Hodgson," ,. said the
stranger, gravely.
Fugard took the card. Then his bitter
voice grew menacing as he said: "See
here, Mr. Sneath of London, you're going
to step right up Into that wagon and get^
to Gehenna if you like; but you don't stay
here to eat your heart out while I'm
around. You're a colonist, ain't you?"
"No."
"You've bought a magnificent' cattlo
ranch in London, haven't you?"
"No."
Fugard looked at the man as though he
were a monstrosity. Then he said. "Well,
then, what in thunder brings you here?"
"1 want to see Mr. Hodgrson. Is he
here?"
"Yes. He's in there, irrigating his in
side. Walk in. You're a phenomenon.
Mr. Sneath, and I congratulate you on it.
All right. I'll attend to your horses. I see
you've brought your own feed. That's
lucky. Not a straw to be had in thn whole
city, and our nags expired in trying to ac
commodate themselves to the circum
stances. Step right in."
The stranger did so.
After nearly an hour of gentle, steady
work. Fugard left the horses with a ca
ressing pal and made his way to the of-.
flee again. He paused for a moment on the
doorstep and said: "Percy waxeth elo
quent to the stranger." Then he entered.
"1 tell you, sir. it was a cruel shame, an
outrage, to send those fellows out here."
"Hear, hear," said Fugard.
"Glad you've com.- \n. Ueorge," said the
boy, as he excitedly strode up and down
on the debris-strewn floor. "I've Just
lieen telling Mr. Sneath about the Bron
cers. The company's busted, George. The
vrholf thing's a swindle. Sir Richard
Welcher Is in quod, and Mr. Sneath has
come out on behalf of the shareholders -
the widows and orphans--to settle things
up, find take over the assets."
"Take over the assets," echoed Fugard.
"That's Kn<ui."
"I have a letter for the Broncers," said
Sneath. "How long have they been here?"
"Oh. about fortyâ l mean about two
years." answered Percy.
"But why did they stay?" pursued
Sneatb.
"You don't know Willie Broncer." an
swered Percy again somewhat feebly.
"Come, come, sir." said Sneath, "it is
an unfortunate case, certainly, but it
seems to me that you gentlemen take It
almost morbidly to heart. After all, you
are not responsible for â "
"No; but you see we have watched them
making their tight for it." interrupted
Fugard, quietly. "Come out and see the
city by moonlight, will you? See that big
mountain over there with the moon
perched on Its camel back" The Broncers'
ranch is live miles behind that. Quite a
drive, eh ?"
Then, running hack to the door, ho

Only a trickle or water remained In the
ruddy-colored bed of the Arroyo del
Diablo to reflect the burning thirsty rays
of a cloudless December sun, although,

Mrs. Tarboxâ lt Is so radical. It is not

Miss Brownâ Who can foresee, infallibly,
what lines will be best for a club
or an individual? No one could
foresee this power which federa
tion has given into our hands.
All power, whether the result of
genius, position or wealtn, brings

or discarded? In place of the

Mrs. Y>oe â Gracious!
Mrs. Roeâ Very poetical, butâ a sword is
so unladylike. (Shudders.)
Miss Brownâ Yet you must admU that it
is more efficacious than a pair of
scissors.
Mrs. Tarboxâ l agree with Mrs. Roe; it
-*â¢*<, is not so ladyjlka,
than a year ago. In the bed of this well
nigh dried up stream a man was working
with feverish energy. On the bank of the
stream, some fifty yards away, stood
a much patched tent and beside it
a farm wagon; two mules. with
pinched up bellies, protruding ribs and
fore feet hobbled were visible in the
nearer distance as they moved to and fro
with tfcat kangaroo-like movement which
hobbling engenders. High up to the west,
three miles away and divided from the
stream by many a rugged gulch, stood
the crazy Diablo ranch house, its white
washed," sun-bathed boards gleaming
brightly through the dancing transparen
cy, and far away behind it again rose
the towering camel-backed mountain, the
largest of all the threatening fantastic
volcanic monsters which completely sur
rounded the landscape. Not a tree was
visible- -not a patch of ~reen; nothing but
a cheerless, sun-cracked broken waste of
bowider-strewn reddish soii. with here
and there a sapless, blackened shrub, or
a patch of dull gray brushwood, or the
gleam on the bones of a long dead beast,
or the sheen on a swollen hide yet to
be picked by yonder carrion birds.
Hour after hour the man plodded on at
his work, his mouth firmly set and the
perspiration steadily dripping from his
face a:id standing out in beads on the
gray-flecked hair on his temples. He had
dammed the stream some yards above
him, and had conducted the" accelerated
current to the place where he was work
ing, and his labor consisted in tilling a
large Iron basin with the red poll dug
from the banks and ttwaylng it gently to
and fro as the water played on it with an
even, rocking motion, until all the soil
was washed away. It was wonderful, ex
hilarating! No matter where he piunged
hla shovel, the loosened soil fairly glit
tered with shining metal, and the worker,
as he toiled in the sun, filled
a huge. bulging sark with great
knobs of shining gold. until the
banks of thr. stream were punctured in a
hundred places by his miniature excava
tions, and the bed of the stream was lit
tered with glistening fragments. It was
plain from thd man's; frantic exertions
that he was working against, time, and
though his tall spare frame and mus
cular arms showed no .sign of strain or
tiring, the drawn and driven expression
on his deeply lined handsome face was re
pulsive in its intensity.
At length, when the sun had sunk be
hind the hills and a vapor was beginning
to rise from thf> stream, he dropped his
tools, and picking tip a gardener's line
measured out a square which included
all his workings, marking out each corner
with a heap of bowlders. Then, lifting
up the sack as though it were a feather,
he ran headlong to the tent.
â¢Mi a cot inside the tent a man was
lying, muttering to himself and cease
lessly chewing the blanket which par
tially covered him. One of his feet was
swathed up in an old horsecloth, and
fever shone in his eyes ;;nd burned on
his puffer) ghastly face. r P to this cot
the laborer strode, and taking the burn
ing hand of the sufferer cried exultingly:
"Can you start for home to-morrow,
Inky? Home, Inky.' Home at last!"
"Home! Home: Never again, never
again," echoed hack from the dusk
enshrouded bed. the whisper falling
hoarse and strange on the evening still
ness.
Passing a hand across his forehead, the
laborer took a stable lamp from the
floor, and. lighting it. gazed long and
earnestly in the si<-k man's face with un-
Bpeakable dread In ins own. Then, put
ting down the lantern, he filled a cap
sule with quinine, and. tenderly raising
the lolling bald head, said:
"Is the pain very bad? H^re, take this.
That's right, ('an you eat some beans?"
But the sick man. feebly shaking his
head, dropped to the pillow again, fixed
his eyes vacantly on the tent-roof, and
beat with his hands on the cot.
Leaving his side, the laborer quietly
husied himself in preparation for the mor
row's departure. Not a tremor in his
voice betrayed the patient, hopeless suf
fering which his face expressed, as he
chatted blithely on of the home-coming
In store and the well-loved faces so soon
to be seen again: and as lie worked, un
consciously gripping each thing he
touched with the full forc^ of his hands,
his eyes ever wandered to a species of al
tar by the side of his own cot. consisting
of a packing barrel, round the top of
which a mantelpiece border, once, no
doubt, a masterpiece of feminine achieve
ment, hut now faded and tntterÂ»d, had
been ruthlessly nailed, and on which was
enthroned the single photograph of a
girl, whose trusting, steadfast eyes fol
lowed his regarding gaze, no matter
whence directed. And always as his eyes
met hers a flood of hopeless bitterness
Feempd to shine from their depths, and
the lines seemed to deepen round his
mouth.
Often he went to his cot, and smooth
ing the pillow with womanly tenderness,
or holding water to the drled-up lips said,
"Home, T'nky, Home." Once he shook
some of the contents of the sack which he
had carried into bis wide-brimmed hat,
and held it before the sufferer's eye, but
looking suddenly Into the hat himself he
saw its contents were black as night, and
rushing across the tent, he hurled the hat
through the gaping flap out into the dark
ness. Then, going to the little table by
the tent-pole on which the lantern stood,
he took from Its drawer a paper hag of
powder and some shot, and loaded a
rusty gun with suggestive deliberation.
Leaving the bag open on the table, he

crept to the place where the water na.l

the gardener's line. Taking the In* nÂ»

on which It was rolled was hare in his
hands. Then pulling the line taut he

once more, and unfastening it from tn*
tent pole tied It round his waist, grasped
up the bucket and began to describe a
sweeping circle over the uneven rocky
ground. His journey occupied intermin
able time. But he reached the stream
bed. and circling round strained the lino
to its fullest stretch, as he felt in vain
for the singing, trickling stream. Then
he tied the line to his foot, and lying flat
on his face stretched out his hands,
straining and striving until his arms,
Beemed to crack and his body to stret^
to an abnormal length. He touched thÂ«*
water and filled the bucket with a. scream
of joy, and turnins: commenced to crawl
again on his endless, torturing way. He
reached the tent and crept toward tha
raving voice. Then he arose to his fe*Â»t,
and feeling for the sufferer's head raised
the bucket nearer, nearer, and it came up
lightlyâ so lightly that he dropped the
round bald head .and fearfully plunged
his arm into its depth. Tt was empty!
Incalculable time passed away, but th*
raving voice shrieked ever on and on in
the tent. while form like that of r tor

Goodness knows. we've had

Miss Brownâ Yesâ because of a misunder-
Btandlng. It goes without saying
that no one would believe that
this club, alone, could wield an
appreciable influence in this mat
ter; but no one could doubt that
the concerted action of the repre
sentative women of America,
exerted through the Federati^j
Clubs, would fall to have a mark>

so, for visions do descend upon
me, sometimes.
Mrs. Roeâ Well, I'm not. I'm ; always
practical. Now, It seems to me
that, should we decide to do this
thing, we might be doing those
women a real injury.
Mrs. Goveâ ln what way?
Mrs. Roeâ Why, how do we know that
each one of them, on account of
losing her position, might not
marry some good man and be
'nicely taken care of for the rest
of her days?

Mrs. Steele (she holds out a telegram)â

way. They were just petting: their tent
into shape. The dynamite packages were
arranged for pillows on the ground at the
hpad of the red blankets at either side,
the candle on a stick was ready for even

too early to slip about for onÂ« or two
rabbit for breakfast. They have
EpWidfd living, anyway.
That's the mine down there a few yards.
A mass of rock ten feel thick happens to
reach its top Just to the level of the sur
rounding ground. They have h<^en dig
ging beside It, and an excavation is ten
feet deep with a foot of water in it. The
irregular mass shows no vein formation,
but the miners say it Is a Quartz vein
sticking up above bedrock. No free gold
shows in the rook, hut Mr. Zammitt says
that one assay shows $6 50 and another
$11 50 per ton.
Mr. Zammitt cheerfully sits on his store
of gold and tells. He has prospected up
north and arc.und in past years, and in
the great days of old Mooneyville by the
Sea he worked blark s.-.nd there. He be
lieved, as did others, that the gold came
from back there Borne place, and for fif
teen years he has taken his rrun pr-.d
spade at times and wandered the penin
sula over, Just as many other hopeful
people have done.
A few weeks ago a scared jackrabblt
led him to some loose rocks in the bushes,
assays of which showed gold, and then he
found where the rock came from. John
F. English, the commission merchant,
whom ho knew well, happened out that
way and the upshot* was that Mr. En
glish quietly slipped around and bought
lots to the extent of 240 by 500 feet. Mr.
Zammitt has a half interest in the mine
and Ostwald. who has prospected, too,
was hired to help begin operations. A
small hand bilge, pump is bfing rigged up
and the rock is to be explored in depth
until gold or faith gives out.
There Is some gold In that rock, but It
is not a defined quartz vein. The body of
that big "quartz vein" Is schist, a sedi
mentary rock, and some nodules and
streaks of quarts show through some of
it, probably Intruded by percolation and
crystallized. Tt would seem likely that It
quill Is now Inserted In either nostril to '
allow the subject presently to breathe
through, and cotton wool lightly pressed
around the base to keep the liquid plaster
fr >m Intruding. A pair of scissors Is a!
ways kept handy, so as to he able to cut
off the topa of the quills should by any
chance the plaster splash up and cover
them.
All being read:-, a few cheering words
are spoken to the unhappy victim and the
plaster Is mixed. This Is carefully poured
or sprinkled over the features.
The following operations have then to
be performed with skill and celerity:
Directly the plaster lightly covers the
face a small but strong thread Is laid
on either cheek, running from the top of
the head down to the neck, and Is pressed
into the plaster until It almost touches
the skin. Additional plaster, is now placed
on. until the whole is about an Inch in
thickness. Ere this has quite set the
Is part of n tilted sedimentary stratum
harder than the strata on either side,
which have thus worn away, leaving a lit
tle of the stratum of schist protruding.
How far bedrock on either side lies below
the sand ha.s not been found.
Some small samples of the rock wore as
sayed at the laboratory of Abbott A.
Hanks on Montgomery street, for The
Call. Pieces containing quartz showed no
gold at all. A pioce of the schist itself
showed "a trace of gold," Mr. Hnnks
foundâ possibly at the rate of 50 cents a
ton. The new sold mine thus seems at a
cursory view to be in a sedimentary strat
um into which a little gold has been de
posited in solution as it Is deposited here
and there in granito. sandstone and the
country rock of gold-bearing veins gen
erally.
Henry O. Hanks, the old and widely
known mineralogist, who was State Min
eralogist for six years, on seeing the rock
said:
"There seems to be nothing to this
schist that a mining man would attach
any Importance to at all, though there
might be gold in such rock. Nothing has
been discovered on the peninsula to
warrant any great expectations. There
are many small quartz veins which show
trace? of gold and such discoveries have
been made at three or four places betwr-en
the park ami Baden, but none have been
of value. Near the Baden packing house
there are good copper indications and a
shaft seventy-five, fee-t deep was sunk
there once. Copper has also been found
about South San Francisco. About Twin
Peaks there are a dozen prospect holes,
where people have found mineral Indica
tions, and about the Corbett road near Tn
pleside. Where the boulevard turns west
from the Almshouse through the gap con
slderable prospecting has been done. Cop
per, chromic iron, cinnabar, oxide of man
ganese and a little gold have been found
within the city limits, but no deposits of
economic value. A valuable deposit of
quicksilver would be more likely found
than one of gold. The formations are nut
favorable to gold, and nowhere in thn
("cast Range south nf Trinity <'ounty h;is
anything been found worthy of the n.nn.'
of a gold mine. There have, been little
discoveries here and there rich in sYnall
' before mentioned threads are pulled up I
through the mold, so as to cut the plaster.
Otherwise it would be Impossible to re
'< move It from the face.
The subject whose mask Is being taken
Is now having a lively tune. The plaster
presses and burns his cheeks. He thinks
of all the horrible tilings that might
happen should those two little quills get I
, i hoked. Not a sound of the outer world '
can he hear save some indistinct rumbling ;
1 ard the thud, thud of his beating heart '
, almost deafens him. Hours seem to pass
and he is powerless to know what is going
on. He lies helplessly there, and. perhaps,
out of curiosity, tries to raise an eyelid.
That settles him, as by this time the
plaster has hardened and holds the lid in
an immovable grip.
A sickly sensation comep over himâ he
feds paralyzed and unconsciously gives
a long groan. This, by the way, can only
j come through the quills in his nostrils,
amounts, but none that ever amounted tn
anything. At one time a gold mill was
put up at one discovery in the Santa Cruz
mountains, hut was abandoned."
Almarin B. Paul, one of the oldest min
ing engineers of California, Is another
mineralogioal expert who has given some
attention to this field in the past.
"Twenty-five yearÃ rkh i wont nut to
noar where Baden Is now to pro a gold
mine." ho said, "and T haVe boon out
there in later times. There has been a
good <lt>nl of talk about gold discoveries
at various times. I mm 1 .* 1 an assay for
nno man many years ago, but don't re
member tho result. That rock was from
Sutro'a land. W. T. Coleman once
thought he had struck gold on his place.
I found he had a quartz vein, but there
was (inly a trace of gold in it. Tracrs of
gold in very low grade ruck may be found
in many places, but as to profits I
wouldn't pay car fare for all of it. If
cinnabar were found there might bo some
sense in it. for the formation is favorable
to that. Th? only possibility of making
any money out of gold mining In San
Francisco is in tlio\ beach Hands."
The memory and the voluminous records
of Henry G. Hanks provide recollections
of a number of past gold "excitements" In
San Francisco.
A generation aRn some yellow metal was
found near the Presidio and there was
quite a fuss about It. hut it turned out to
be brass filings on the site nf an old ma
chine shop. Several times red jasper has
b^en found in the hills showing: minute
yellow specks, Rnfl as many times it
turned out to be brnss scraped off softer
brass nails in shoes. A Rood many years
ago two men thought they had found a
bonanza at Main and Market streets,
where colors of gold were found in the
dirt. Then some p'oneer came along and
remembered a quartz mill that was there
in the fifties and shoveled out its tailings.
In 1896 the laborers employed by some
street contractors uncovered a ledge of
gold at Geary street and Central avenue.
The contractors hastily boarded up the
place :ind spent a week getting ready for
operations, for the rock was fairly yellow.
Then an p.ssnyer told them they had sul
phurets of iron.
Of course there have been all sorts of
and It naturally alarms the operator, who!
Immediately shouts as loudly as he can to
know if anything Is the matter. The!
subject Is .iust able to hear his voice, and
so raises his hand, a prearranged signal
that "all's well."
The plaster, through being mixed with
warm water, quickly hardens, and in the
course of about" five minutes the mold is
strong enough to be taken off. It has '
to be carefuly done, as the BUbject is |
generally so very eager to get a mouth
ful of fresh air once again. A slight tap
with the i.nnd is given to the two side
pieces, which relieves the joints made li
the thread. The top or central piece is
then lifted up and pulled slightly down
ward, BO as to withdraw the quills from
the nose as they come out with the mold. !
The sides are then taken off. Probably

quests for the buried treasures left by old
sea captains, et al., ana according to the
advice of spiritualists, old charts, etc.,
but they have nothing to do with mining.
Cinnabar or the ore of quicksilver has at
various times opened wide the eyes of
contractors and lot owners who did not
knr.w that there is any amount of cinna
bar through the Coast Range, but seldom
a deposit large enough to work.
But the story of the beach sands Is a
slightly different one. The beach sands
from Alaska to Patagonia show generally
traces of gold, but only here and there
are they concentrated so that they can
be worked profitably. Below the Cliff
Holism is such a place. The gold ia asso
ciated with black sand, or magnetic iron.
The gold has been washed down to the
sea by the ages of erosion of the very
low grade veins inland and beaten out
of the bluffs by the eternal hydraulic ope
rations of the waves.
One skillful with a pan can find "colors"
in nearly every pan washed along that
beach, but it is only strata of concen
trated black sand and gold buried a few
feet deep which ever pays to work m
siuic.s. For more than a generation
these sands have been worked at times.
The great day of the beach was in the
winter of 1883-84, when Mooneyville was
booming. A craze set in and over 200 men
took possession of ground, camped there
in picturesque array and made a redhot
mining camp. "Con" Mooney ran a little
resort near there and gave the camp its
name. Crowds went there daily, fakers
swarmed, the police were busy and all
sorts of "processes" for saving the gold
came to the front. A few made money
and many did not. The gold was fine and
hard to save. The winds would fill up an
excavation over night and so would the
breakers sometimes. When the richest
strata of black sand seemed worked out
operations ceased, but at times men have
returned and perhaps made wages.
So fine is this gold that Henry G. Hanks
has estimated that it takes 155,500 average
particles to make an ounce worth $18.
This gold is always in thin scales about
.0095 bi ,00884 of an inch in size. One com
pany of mlhera spent several hundred
dollars and secured $5 worth of gold alto
gether. YV. R. Farwell of Alameda Is now

â¢ â¢ â¢
The working of gold mines In th<Â» sand
hills is not a new thing. Mines were op
erated out there from thirty to forty-five
years ago.
In those days a mine must yield from
$30 to $100 a ton in order to be a good in
vestment. One man was known to Just
make a living with a yield of $30 The
best yielding of any on the peninsula was
said to be $20, the smallest $8.
Directly on the county line was isl
tacion mine, after the valley of the same
name, where it was situated. The site
was an old Indian burying ground, and
often In digging and blasting grewsomo
finds were made, not at all to the lik-
Ing of the laborers. It proved to be not
worth while in those days, but the own
ers kept at it. until the output milled 520.
It was then discarded as useless.
11. N. Tilden, the commission merchant,
tells of a mine on the Flint tract which
he now owns. This is situated half way
between Sutro's statue of liberty on the
Seventeenth street hill and the Affiliated
Colleges. Mr. Tilden says there is not
now and never was any gold found on the
land. According to his statement the
first rock which was taken out of the
shaft was washed in pans that had pre
viously had gold in them from a Mexican
mine.' "The result was beautiful, bin at the
second test not a trace of gold could bo
found.
Others tell a different story. They say
there is an abundance of the yellow metal
there and that Mr. Tilden has his rea
sons for not making too much of it at
present.
At least the late Adolph Sutro, who had
a national reputation as a mining expert,
died convinced of the presence of gold In
quantities from his wooded hill to the
ocean. He was constantly digging shafts
and tunneling into the mountain. There
is now an open shaft on the wooded hill
which he leased to some Mexicans. They
go down into the shaft by means of lad
ders and ropes and bring the rock up in
leather bags on their backs. Everything
is hard labor and they make a comfort
able living by this means.
In the year '63 Edward Ewald, an old
time politician, got a few men together
and organized a company. As he says,
they thought it was "the biggest thing
on earth." They dug a shaft ninety-five
feet deep on some land of Mr. Ewald's
and made a man nam.d Higgins the su
perintendent. Mr. Higgins was so op
timistically Inclined that they called tne
mine "Higgins Hope," but Hope produced
no more than $S or $9 to the ton. Mr.
Ewald was seen a few days ago coming
down the hill from the old spot with two
meal sacks filled with rockâ presumably
on his way to an assayer's.
Still further on there were two shafts
sunk by a Mr. Burns and a Mr. Robinson
respectively. Then comes the mine
owned by Mr. English and Mr. Zammitt,
of which much has already been told and
still more remains for the earth to dfs
close. This mine Is situated on the edge
of what old-timers will remember as
Strawberry Island. At the present sea
son, in the midst of the wastes of sand,
this spot is carpeted with tne white blos
soms and beautiful green leaves of the
strawberry vine. Mr. Zammitt recently
discovered on his ground quartz in which
particles of gold were easily seen. It is
further down in the same ledge that
he and Mr. English are now at work.
Mr. Zammitt says It means million*,
and also asserts that he has another sur
prise on hand, the nature of which he
will no; divulge.
Right here is the last trace of gold un
til the ocean beach is reached, where
there is an immense deposit in the black
sand. It is lying idle, waiting for mod
ern machinery to separate it.

SHE cold and gloomy weather brought by the east wind coon
cleared away, and the sun shone out bright and clear, with a
â¢warm breeze from the south, a reeze that brought out the vio
lets In great profusion. Still the place was not the same. The_ne
groes ceased theii songs, except Johnny Bapter, and even ne
didn't Blng as loudly nor as tantly as he used to. And they
ceased to wresi and play at night. It seemed that they had prob
lems to consider. They were not sure of their position; they had no
pody to advise them. Thej might have asked advice on the subject,
but freedom appeared to add to their shyness, and they refrained
from asking for any information or advice. Just why this should be
â o, nobody has discovered to this day. Some of the less fortunate
found strangers to give them advice and to make them promises that
vrere never to be redeemed; but on the Abercrombie place the negroes
â worked In the dark, as the saying is, except for Buch advice as the
rtrong common sense of Aaron was able to give them. They had the
Idea that, havii been made the object of what seemed to be a special
interposition of providence, they were to be sustained and maintained
In the came way.
Well, ar.yhuv. , the sun was shining brightly axid the air was warm.
The tools and instruments of war were following the courses of the
streams that plow seaward, and ture on the Abercrombie place had
forgotten nil about them But let the sun shine ever so brightly, the
children failed to find Mr. Thimblefinger, and no message came from
Mrs. Meadows.
It was noticed that Drusilla never Joined in the regrets that Buster
7cmes and Sweetest Susan expressed when day after day passed and
no Mr. Thimbleflngei came.
"I don't believe you care whether he comes or not," cried Sweetest

Meanwhile, une afternoon when the bud was preparing to go to beÂ«i,
and when the children were still expecting little Mr. Thimbleflnger'
they heard a voice calling from the big road, which was not far away
from the Bprtng:
"Hayo, dar folks! Will yo' dogs bite?" The voice was that of a
negro woman. Khe was driving a small steÂ«>r to a wagon, but had left
the vehicle on the side of the road and had come over the stile. She
*vas tall, and appeared to be about 10 years old. She had a countenance
that could smile, but its aspect was now serious, and her eye was
bright and keen.
"You all oughter know me." she cried as she enme up "dat Is ef

The children confirmed this by saying that the troops not only
had. not carried anything off, but had driven two mules Into the cow

called de case, and Brei Fox tuck de stan' an' tol f his side; an' den Brer Rabbit got up an' tol' his side. Judge Wolf tuck off
his specs an' look at Brer Rabbit wld a broad grin. Den he ax Brer Fox how many goobers he had. an' Brer Fox say he dunno
how many, but dey must 'a 1 been a bushel. Judge Wolf ax 'im wher-'bouts he got urn. He say he got urn fum a man on

"Judge Wolf say: 'How'll you have urn. Brer Fox, raw er parched?'
"Brer Fox holler out: 'Parched, parched :'

ter goodness," she said, as she sat down by the children, "I hope ter
goodness dat he wont say dat he want de vlttles cooked. Kaze ef he
done dat ltd put me in mm' er dat ol' tale my mammy usetor tell me."
"What tale was that I .'" Sweetest Susan asked.
"<th' you all done hear tell un it mo' times dan you been ter
chu'oh. You ain't never had ol' Remus to tell It; but dar Is dat ol'
A'on, an' ol' Fountain, an" Big Sal what dey been doln' all dls time ef
dey ain't never tol 1 jrou dat tale? Ef dey ain't got sense nun* for to tell
you all de tales dey is gwine, you better sic de dogs on urn an' run urn
off de place â ef you goi any dogs lef."
"Well, they don't tell us any tales," said Buster John, truly enough.
"Old Aunt Free Polly used to tell us some, but that's been so long ago
that we've forgotten th^m. You ought not to have said anything
about a tale If you didn't want to tell It."
Aunt Mlnervy Ann looked at the child and laughed. "Heyo, here!"
she exclaimed; "ef dey'a gwine ter be any BWellln' up an' glttln' mad,
I'll tell de tale, an" git away fum here dcs quick ez I kin. I ain't come,
ter dls place fer to git in no fuss."
The children composed themselves comfortably on the dead grass
and Aunt Minervy Ai.n told this story of
"BROTHER RABBIT AND THE GOOBERS."
"Way bark yonder." Bald Aunt Mln^rvy Ann, retylng her head
handkerchief, "de times wld de cratures wuz mighty much like dey
is wld folks now, speshully we-all up dar at de Perdue plantation. Dej
wuz hard times. I dlsremembr whedder dey had been a war and de
army awep' "loner, or whedder dey wuz a dry drought. Dey ain't much
dlffunce when craps fail.
"Well, anyhow de times wuz mighty hard. Vlttles wuz skacer dan
hen's tushes, an' dem what had it, hid It. An' ef dey didn't hide It, dey
stayed mighty close by It. or Brer Rabbit wuz In Jest as bad fix ez
any un urn, ef not wuss. Slick ez he wuz, he want slick miff for ter
git eump'n ter eat whar dey want none. De calamus patch gun out, all
de saplln's had been harked higher up dan Brer Rabbit kin reach, der
tater patches wuz empty, an' de pea vines wuz dry miff for to ketch
flre wldout any hep.
"So dar twuz. l,ike de common run er po" white folks, Brer Rabbit
had a big fam'ly. De young uns wuz constant a-cryln', 'Daddy! Dad
dy! Fetch me sump'n ter eat!' An' ol' Miss Rabbit wuz drlbblln' at de
mouf, she wuz dat hungry.
"OV Brer Rabbit wuz so mad kaze he can't git no vlttles nowhar
and nohow dat he kicked a cheer 'cross de room wld his hin" foot and
ekeered de young uns so dat dey flipped under de bed, an" dar dey
stayed twel der daddy wuz out er sight an' henrln".
'"Brer Rabbit knowed mighty well dat 'twain't gwlne ter do fer him
ter be settin 1 rmm' de house wid de Fam'ly dat hongry dat dey can't
skacely stan' 'lone. So he comb his hair, an* brush his hat, an" put on
his mlts fer ter keep de sun from frecklin' his han's, an' tuck down his
walkin" cane, an' put cut down de road fer ter see what he kin see, an'
hear what he kin hear."
At this point ihe children laughed. Sweetest flusan convulsively
and Kuster John more sedately, but still heartily. Aunt Mlnervy Ann
paused and regarded them with grave and inquiring eyes.
â¢What de matter now?" pho asked, solemnly. At this the children
laughed louder than ever. "Well!"' she cried, "ef you gwine to have
conniption fits, I'll wait twel dey pass off."
"Why, I was laughing because you said Brother Rabbit put on his
mlts to keep his hands from freckling," exclaimed BuÃter John; and
Sweetest SuÃan, when she could catch her breath, declared that she
was laughing for the same reason.
"You-all must be mighty ticklish," remarked Aunt Mlnervy Ann,
plucking at the dead grass. "I ain't sco nothin' funny in dat. You
nee'n't think dat rabbits is like dey uster be. Dey done had der day.
In dem times dey growed big and had lots er "sense, an' dey wuz
mighty keerful wid dey self. Hut dey done had der day. Folks* come
'long an' tuck der place, an' since den dey done dwindle 'way twel dey
aln't nothin' mo' dan runts, an" skacely dat. Folks holdin' de groun'
now, but how long dey ter hoi' it" How long fo' sump'in else'll
come 'long an' take folks' place? De time may be short er it may be
long, but It'll comeâ you mln' what 1 t.-ll you; an' when it do come,
folks'll dwindle 'way an' git ter be runts dea like de creeturs did, and
dcy'l] ferglt how ter talk so ev-ybody kin know what dey sayin".
".Look at de ere. tun! Why. de time wuz when dey could talk same
ez folks, but now dey can't hardly jabber, an' dey ain't nobody know
what dey sayin' 'cept dis here A'on you got here"â the children looked
at each other and smiled â "an' dat dun't do him ncr dem no good. Now
<i.s 'â â /. de creetura is, de folks'll be when de time come â you mark my
word!"
"But all this time," remarked Buster John, slyly, "the rabbits In
tin tale are Huffering mightily for something to eat."
"Dats so, honey! I got bo much on my mm' dat I done clean fer
got 'bout de tale. I wuz thinkin' 'bout de time when we-all, white and
black, would he brung low. You'll hay to scuzen me. Bho. Well, den.
01' Krer Rabbit put on his mits and tuck down his walkin' cane, and
went promenadin' down de big road. Ef he met anybody, dey never
rould gu*-ss dat he wuz mighty nigh famished, kaze he walk dcs ez btg
gity ez if he dcs had de finest kinder dinner. He went on. smoothln'
down his mustaches, when who should he meet but Brer Fox, wld a
big basket on his arm.
" 'Whar you been. Brer Fox?'
" 'Lioungin' 'roun'. Whar you g~wine, Brer Rabbltf
" "Up hill rind down dale. What you got in yo' basket. Brer Fox?*
" 'Dcs pr hatful er goobers, Brer Rabbit.'
" 'Parched, Brer Fox?'
" 'Yes, indeedy, Brer Rabbit; parched good en brown.'
" 'No, I thank you, Brer Fox; none fer me. Ef dey wuz fresh an'
raw now, maybe I'd take some. But parched â my stomach won't
Btan" urn. M<>' dan dat, I dcs had a bait er groun' squir'l.'
" 'Now, Brer Rabbit was hankerin' arter de goobers so bad dat he
can't stan' still, an' when he say groun' squir'l. Brer Fox under jaw
drap an' gun ter trimble an' quiver. He say:
" 'Wuz he fat. Rrer Rabbit?'
" 'Fat ez a butter-ball, Brer Fox, but not too fat; dey wua plenty
er lean meat.'
" My gracious. Brer Rabbit! "Whar'd you git him?'
" 'Back up de road a piece. Brer Fox. A whole family un urn staya
dar.'
" 'Show me de place, Brer Rabbit; my ol" 'oman been hankerin' at
ter groun' squir'l fur do longest.'
" 'I'll show you. Brer Fox; but yo" claws longer'n mine, an' you'll
hatter do de grabblin'.'
"Brer Fox jaw shuck like he had a swamp chill. He 'low: 'You
nevpr is see nobody grabble, Brer Rabbit, twel you see me.'
" 'I'll stan' by, Brer Fox. an' see it well dnn^.'
"Now, Brer Rabbit did know whar dey wuz a burrow er some kin.
but he ain't know wedder It wuz a grrotm' squlrn er a wooAret Â«r a
hlghlan' moccasin. So he tuck Brer Fox up de big road a piece, an'
den dey struck out throo de woods. But fo dey start In de timber
Brer Rabbit 'low:
" 'You better hide yo' basket er goobers In de bushes. Brer IPox.
kaze it'll bother you ter tote it throo de bushea. I'll watch you grab
ble, an' I'll keep my eye on de basket.'
"So said, so done. Brer Fox sot de basket down in de bushes, an'
dey klvered it wid leaves and trash, and went on. Blmeby dey got tÂ«v
de place whar Brer Rabbit say de fambly er de groun' squir'l live, axr
he show Brer Fox de mouf er de burrow. Brer Fox 'low:
" 'It'll be hard diggin, Brer Rabbit.'
" 'De harder de diggrin, Brer Fox, de bigger de crap. Dafa what
I hear urn say.'
"Wid dat Brer Fox shucked his coat an' roll up his shirt sleeve*
an' start ter diggln'. He made de dirt fly. Atter while he stop ter rÂ«Â«t
and 'low:
" 'Keep yo' eye on my goobers. Brer Rabbit; don't let nobody run
off wid urn;' an' den he sot in ter grabblin' agin.
" 'I'll watch urn. Brer Fox; don't make no doubt er dat.'
"Den Brer Rabbit run to whar de basket wuz, flung- de trash offn
it, tuck it off in de woods a little piece and emptied all de goobers out*n
It. Den he fill it up wid sticks and chips, mos' ter de top, an' on d*
trash he put a layer er goobers. Den he tuck it back and klvered It
like twuz at first, an' went ter whar Brer Fox wuz gr&bblln'. Brer
Fox Mow :
" You smell mighty strong er parched goobers. Brer Rabbit.*
" 'I don't doubt dat. Brer Fox; I lifted de lid er ds basket far tn
pee ef dey wuz all dar, an' de stench fum urn come mighty nigh knock
in' me down. Fer a minit er mo' I wuz dat weak an' sick I come
mighty nigh gwine home.'
"Well, Brer Fox he grabble and grabble twel he git tired er ffrab
blin', an' den he Mow dat he b'lleve he'll put off eatln* any groun'
squir'l twel some yuther day. Brer Rabbit say he kin do ez he pleasei
'bout dat; an' den dey went on back ter whar dey left de basket. Brej
Rabbit helt his nose an' lifted de lid an' looked in, an' 'low:
" 'Dey all dar. Brer Fox; you can look fo' yo'self.'
" 'I don't 'spute it. Brer Rabbit; I ain't say dey ain't all dar/
" IDat may be. Brer Fox, but I hear folks say you mighty s*p4dona,
an' I don't want nobody for ter be s'plcionin' er me.'
"Brer Fox Mow: 'Don't kick fo' you're spurred. Brer Rabbit.'
"Brer Rabbit say: 'De right kinder horse don't need no span In',
Brer Fox.'
"Well, Brer Fox picked up his basket an' went on home, axr* Brer
Rabbit he went de yuther way; but by de time Brer Fox git out ci
sight good, ol' Brer Rabbit run home an' git a basket an" run back
ter whar he done hid de goobers, an' 'twan't no time fo' he had urn all
at home, an' him an' his ol' 'oman an' de chillun had a reg'lar feastln'
time.'
"When Brer Fox foun' dat he had mo' trash dan goobers In hfi
basket, he was dat mad dat he could 'a' bit hisse'f; but he ain't let on.
He know dey ain't no use makin" no fuss, an' he know mighty well dai
he can't ketch Brer Rabbit; he done tried dat befo'.
"So dis time he went ter law 'bout it. He laid de case 'fo ol* Judgt
"Wolf, an' dey got out papers, an' sent de papers atter Brer Rabbit.
Well, dey want no gittin' 'roun' dat. Brer Rabbit had ter go; he wui
mighty skittish, but he knowed dat ef dey got de law on 'lm he won'l
have no peace in dat settlement. So he went ter court, an' dar hÂ«
foun' a whole passel er de creeturs. When he got in, ol' Judge Woll
tuck his seat on (!â¢-> high rtatform an' put on his specs an' started tez
readin' in a great big book. Dey called de case, and Brer Fox tuck dÂ«
stan' an' tol' his side; an' den Brer Rabbit got up an' tol' his side.
Judge Wolf tuck off his specs an' look at Brer Rabbit wid a broad
grin. Den he ax Brer Fox how many goobers he had, an' Brer Foi
say he dunno how in. my. but dey must 'a' been a bushel. Judge Woll
ax Mm wher-'bouts he got urn. He say he got urn fum a man on da
river.
"Judge Wolf 'low: 'A man in dp river! Well, ef dat de cam you
must 'a' had some sho 'nuff.' Den he turn ter Brer Rabbit an" 'low;
'Brer Rabbit, you'll hatter pay Mm his goobers back when you dig y&
crap.' Bier Rabbit say he'll do de best he kin.
"Judge Wolf say: 'Hqw'L you have urn, Brer Fox, raw er parched? l
"Brer Fox holler out: 'Parched, parched!'
"Judge Wolf 'low: 'Brer Rabbit, when yo' dig yo* crop, save all dÂ«
parched goobers fer Brer Fox.'
"Brer Rabbit say he'll be mo' dan glad ter do bo, an' den dej
'Journed de courthouse."
"That's what I call stealing," said Sweetest Susan, emphatically,
as Aunt Mlnervy Ann paused.
There was silence for awhile, and then Aunt Mlnervy Ann Â»hooÂ»
her head and said: "Ef folks had 'a' done dat away 'twould 'a* beÂ«n
Btealln', but de ereeturs â dey got ways er dey own, honey. Dey dunnc
right fum wrong, an' ef dey did 'twould be mighty bad for we-all. Oui
own hosscs 'ud kick us, and our own cows 'ud hook us forty times a
day. Dey wouldn't be no gittln' 'long wid urn de way dey er treated."
"That's so." said Buster John.
Just then Major Perdue came out Into the back pnrch of the blf
house and called Aunt Minervy Ann. It turned out that the two extra
mules in the lot did belong to the major. He borrowed some harnesi
and a wagon and drove it home full of provisions, and with a comfort
able sum of money which the children's grandfather had lent him.
Aunt Minervy Ann carried her cart back empty, but she didn't mind
that. The children rode with her a little piece, and as a result had a
very peculiar experience.

ELLEN M. HENROTIN WRITES ABOUT THE WOMEN'S CLUBS OF C ALIFORNIA.
Mrs. Ellen Honrotlri of Chieako, so well.knownas the organizer of tne Woman's
Congress which was hold in conjunction with the World's Fair in Chicago, was
In San Francisco las) week. She is on her way to attend the Parliament of Wo
mf-n, to be held at Salt Lake City.
I DO not think there i.Â« any stronger
movement in the organising of
women here than there is elsi -
where. I am not sure but what the
old New England States are in the
lead. Massachusetts, for its size,
has the largest number of club women
v state. Pennsylvania has almost
as. many. The clubs are mostly in the
hands of American women and arc
mosi flourishing where the population
la not too largely foreign.
Indeed it is true that women, club
women, and a woman not a club woman
is almost an unknown accident now,
are surely solving a great many prob
lems. We are doing it, though, in such
a quiet way that no one knows much
about it.
A woman earning her own living and
wife of a millionaire may be going
about the same work together. Catholic
or Protestant or Jewish women may be
all working together. Any one can see
the results.

some wreckage and we all ran toward
him. 1 reached him first, by which
time he was lying down, having ap

himself. I took hold of him and
dragged him some distance on his bark
in the water. The women ran to help

sition we carried him to the shore.
From cold and exhaustion he was un
able 10 use his less.
"By this time we discovered a second
man coming in on some wreckage and
1 immediately turned to meet him, leav
ing the women to conduct the first man
to dry land. This man was a passenger
named J.lr. Mooser of Oakland. The
second man to whos'- assistance T uns
now goinc was Peter Johnson, the first
officer. He was very much exhausted
and when I reached him he had very
We are all about alike, but when we
stand behind our prejudices we never
have an opportunity of knowing each
other. The prejudices and sectarianism
are taken down more in women's clubs
than any place else.
"I have heard the argument made
that women's clubs interfere with
church work. I have never found it so.
I have always found the churches very
kind to the women's clubs. Many of
the clubs, particularly in the smaller
towns, were first originated right in
the church society. Where the club
takes up any charity work it invariably
does so because there is the need of
the work, and there is plenty of room
for the .churches and the clubs to do all
they desire/
Very rarely now does any one advance
the idea that the club woman is not a
good house woman because of her club
interests. We all know about club men,
but club women are just the reverse.
We have rest in our homes and go to
the club for stimulus. Any woman is a
better wife, a better mother, a better
sister for being a member of a live club

head and shoulders only were above
v. ,it<-r. 1 took hold of him and was
joined immediately by Mrs. Hennig.
We dragged him toward tne shore.
'.'ln the meantime Mrs. Mi Lean and
Miss Shumwny had conducted their
man some distance above the water
line and taken off his life preserver.
Then Miss Shuinway returned to our
assistance while Mrs: McLean con
tinued with Mr. Mooser, supporting and
guiding him above high water to the
dry ?.-;nd.
"Miss Shumway now joined us and
helped us for some distance, when she
discovered a third man coming in
through the surf. She Imihediatly
struck out to his assistance, saying,
'You stay with this man. I'll go and
help the other man out there.'
"Mrs. Hennig and myself took Mr.
and being interested in club affairs. It
broadens her and widens her sympa
thies, and that is what women need.
But particularly in the West that is not
what the clubs were formed for. They
were formed for the good of the com
munity.
I have been often touched by letters
from small clubs out here in the. dis
tricts a"way from the. railroads. In dis
tricts which are settled by small ranch
ers, where the man does the outside
work and his wife does the work in the
house, and they bring up their families
to work with them. They are the typi
cal California country people, and they
are the ones California will hear from
some day.
I have in mind one club just now be
cause I have been corresponding with
its president. It has fifteen members
and all ranchers' wives. Some have to
go a good many miles to the club, but
they feel that the club is a great deal
to them. They take the smaller chil
dren to the club meeting and they dis
cuss all sorts of subjects. They recount
their experiences in contrivances to
save work in rearing children, in sew
ing, in butter making, in caring for'
fruit, raising chickens and vegetables.

way waded out into the surf, which
waa at this time very rough.
"We had our man on the beach just
above the Avater line and on turning
we saw Miss Shumway had been
knocked off her feet by wreckage. She
had gone to the assistance of Fireman
Hansen further out into the surf than
We had ventured.
"I ran to her assistance, and on
reaching her found that she had taken
hojd of the man and was trying to keep
him from sliding off the wreckage on
which he was lying.
"I then took hold of the man with
her and being soon joined by Mrs. Mc-
Lean we altogether brought the half
drowned man to the shore.
"Immediately upon the discovery of
the first man Mrs. Mr-Lean had sent her
little girl Alta to the station for brandy
meetings all over the world and know
what other women are doing in the
lines that, interest them.
Discussing such topics occupies one
half of the time, the other half is eiven
over to study. This particular club is
studying the history of the United
States and reading American litera
ture. It is almost the only social life
those women have. Before the club
was formed months and months would
go by and those women would not be
off their ranch nor have an idea beyond
their daily routine work. Such dead
level monotony and grind drives the
farmer's -wife crazy.
We interest ourselves in everything
which affects women. The servant eirl
problem, the girls in stores and their
employers, the jails, the reformatories,
all art and the appearance and con
dition of the city.
I have been exceedingly interested in
the California Club here in San Fran
cisco. It is sure to become a great fac
tor in the civic life here. I wish I had
more time to become better acquainted
with its workings, but I know what
lines they are working on. They are
going about their work very slowly
and conservatively and very quietly, but
so much the more surely. It is a large
club already, although only a year
and a line. Soon after all three men.
were landed I saw Mrs; McLean start
with Mr. Mooser across the sand hills
toward the life-saving station, a dis
tance of about a mile. "Miss Shumway
and myself followed as soon as we had
convinced ourselves that no more men
were in sight as far as we could see.
"Thinking that the condition of the
two men remaining on the beach re
quired immediate attention, I assisted
them on their feet and started also to
lead them toward the life-saving sta
tion. Being very large men and very
weak, 1 had to support them nearly all
the way and made but slow progress
through the sandhills.
"Not very far from the beach we met
little Alta McLean returning with a
bottle of brandy. I gave the men some.
Although they objected to it at first,
they were considerably revived by it.
old, and has so many strong, active'
workers. The work is so well organized
that every separate worker has the in
fluence and moral support of the whole
600 members and so can accomplish
just so much the more.
Influence? Well, when it is really
undorstood that the women of the
whole United States are organizing and
educating themselves and standing as
one woman for what we want, I think
we can accomplish anything we set
about. We will have to stick to our
own natural life work. We do not
â want to do men's work nor to interfere
with them. We have our own work,
and it has pone undone long enough.
England, Germany, Russia, France,
Holland, Italy, Australia, every coun
try in the Caucasian world has felt
this woman's club movement.
The Red Cross was one of the first
women's clubs to make itself felt. Flor
ence Nightingale beean the work and
see what it has grown to!
When women organize as we are do
ing and take in the homes of all the
world Ye can do anything we set out
to do. We have only begun to organ

If, we keep within our own sphere of
usefulness we can accomplish any

where we were met by Mrs. Phelps,
who showed us into the kitchen, where
active steps had been taken for the care
of the shipwrecked men. We stayed at
the station assisting- Mrs. Phelps and
Mrs. Swanson in taking the wet cloth
ing off the men and wrapping them in
warm blankets, after which â  Mrs: Mc-
Lean and myself returned to the ocean
beach, where we learned from -Mrs.
Hennig that no more bodies had coma
ashore.

. Mrs. McLean's statement is as foU
lows:
"I have heard read the Rev. Mr.
Petersen's statement and concur with!
all he said up to the time I started
with Mr. Mooser to the station. I soon
met my daughter, - Alta. with tha
brandy, of which I gave Mr. Mooser a,
drink." Although the brandy seemed to
' revive him somewhat he was very
weak, staggering continually and fall-Â«
ing several times. The last time he fell
it was only with the greatest of exer-.
tion on my part that I succeeded in get*
ting him on his feet.
"Just outside the station gate I met
Mrs. Swanson, wife of Surfman Swan
son. I asked her to take him into tha
station kitchen, and then I started back:
again to" the beach.
. "When about half way there I met
Rev. Petersen, Miss Shumway and Mrs.
Nelson with the other two shipwrecked
men. I took Mrs. Nelson's place byj
First Officer Johnson's side, while Mrs.
Nelson hurried to the beach with the
rope. The rest of my experience is the
same as related by Mr. Petersen in his
statement.

Miss Lillian Shumway and Mrs. R.
E. Hennig signed statements that con*

SHOULD MARRIED WOMEN

N dealing conscientiously with so-
Iclal subjects one finds that it Is un
satisfactory to generalize, and dif
ficult to discriminate. The differ
ence between a right and a wrong
conclusion is sometimes so trifling
that It may easily be overlooked even
by a careful expert; yet the conse
| quence of making mistakes In these
! matters may mean the wrecking of
many livesâ which places a heavy re
sponsibility on all who venture to ex
press positive opinions. I would have
no dogmatism. What is good for to
day may be bad for to-morrow. 1
would arrive at the truth.
You may say that I am taking my-
Belf too seriously. In serious matters
people cannot take themselves too seri
ously. The simplest expression is open
to misinterpretation; the most idle
ejaculation is capable of influencing.

I always feel that this particular
question of married women and profes
sions 1b one to be agonized over. "It
all depends," is the answer, so far aa
I am able to judge of it. It is essen
tially a matter of circumstances alter
ing cases. Personally I have no doubt
|as to what Is the ideal life for the
average married woman. She can have
nothing better than a good husband
and ample leisure for her household
duties. When she is so happy as to
have children, they must be her
primary consideration.
The influences brought to bear upon
a child in the first few years of its life
are so all-important that no woman
worthy of her sex would leave It to the
care of others except under pressure of
cruel necessity. There are unfor
tunately some abnormal women who
have, as It were, no aptitude for
motherhood, and the best thing that
can happen to their children is to be
brought up by better hearts; but such
wvmen are the exception

By Sarah Grand,
Author o" -The Heavenly Twins."
They are people who have been per
verted themselves, for the most part, by
uncongenial homes. Among thorn are
many who recognize the defect of their
nature, and do their best to remedy it
by securing women more generously
endowed to bring: up their children; in
this way they do their duty to the best
of their ability, and, having done it,
feel themselves at liberty to follow
special pursultp.
As wives and mothers I should count
these women failures, and should say
that they are quite entitled to try
something else. Let them take up law,
literature, medicine or art if. they like.
Any honorable profession should be
open to them. But if they are affluent
and no necessity constrains them to
make money, any attempt to do so
should be discountenanced for the sake
of those who must work to live.
It is argued, I know, that a woman
may make her household excellently
and follow a profession as well. Many
women do. But it seems to me that the
question is not so much what women
can do when they are driven to it, but
what they ought in fairness to be asked
to do. If you take marriage from the
lowest standpoint, that of a profession
in itself, you will lind yourself forced
to corrsider the strain of following two
professions at the same time. No man
is ever expected to do so. This is one
of the great causes of complaint that
women have had. that if they do any
thing they are expected to do every
thing. Numbers have attempted the
task â borne the children, brought them
up, administered the household and
made the money â each and every duty
was punctually performel: but how
many such women, and of those how
many that were not utter wrecks, have
survived to old age? I tried for many
years to combine housekeeping and lit
erary pursuits, and managed both, but
at infinite cost. My health, household
and literary work all suffered; and it
was not until circumstances put it in
my power to give myself entirely to lit
erature that I succeeded. Versatile
people are usually amateur in every
thing. There are, of course, extraor
dinary exceptions, but then one can
not reason from the exceptions.
The question of professions for mar

other places.

Mrs. N. Ohlahdt and Miss Tillle Ohlandt
have arrived at Paso RobleÃ Springs for
a four weeks' stay. On their return to the
rifd women is usually a question of
means, although when money Is sorely
wanted thore can be no real question in
the matterâ the one of the family who
can make It must make It. And there
fore when one is asked, should married
women follow professions? one is forced
to allow that it depends, and fain to
add, not if they can help it. But if it
be the woman who must work, let her
have her chance as the men would have
â let her. go to her work unhampered
by other cares.
The fairest division of labor in the
social system is for the husband to
make the money and the wife to make
the home; if she does that well she
will have enough to do. And this ar
rangement need not entail the suppres
sion of any great gift. In bygone days
women of extraordinary talent were
condemned, for no crime but their sex
to do plain needlework, which might
just as well have been done for them,
by women of no talent at all; that was 1
a waste of good material for whicli
there can rarely be any necessity.
Home is the woman's sphere used to
mean that life began and ended there,
in a round of amateur performances
and the suppression of all that was in
dividual in everybody.
In P^rance, where it is the rule for
married women to work, the children
undoubtedly sufferâsuffer grievously.
I have studied the subject on the spot,
and been forced to the conclusion that
when there are children they should be
the first consideration, and the parents
are both bound to sacrifice themselves
for their good. Exactly what will be
for the good of the children will often
be a very nice question, and it is es
sentially one of those upon which it

An art patron one day came into Turn

the sum ho had set upon it.
"What!" exclaimed the buyer, "all

"Oh." replied Turner, "Ifs paint you

As a Qirl.
ELLA WHEELER WILCOXâ Who T4l
ever thinks of calling her "Mrs."?â
â  known to fame as the Poetess of
, Passion before she was out of her
teens, Js still as merry and light
hearted as she was when a girl in Mil
waukee, when she danced and sang her
way into the hearts of those it pleased
her to call friends.
Ella Wheeler was ' born in. Johnstown.
Center, Wis., and obtained her education
in the public schools and at the State Uni
versity at Madison. After her graduation
and release from the irksome environ
ments of class rooms she was thrown on
her own resources and often she burned
the midnight oil penning crude bits of
verse and more ambitious prose with
which she often unsuccessfully sought a
market. Fate, spurred on by ambition,
caused her to take up her residence in
Milwaukee. There she found a home with.
Mrs. W. H. Radway, who at a ripe age is
passing her declining days in peace and
happiness at Banning, Los Angeles Coun
ty, Cal. She danced, sang and romped
with Mrs. Radway's children, one of â¢
whom, W. C. Hathaway, is a resident of
Kansas City and an employe of the Ride
nour-Baker Grocery Company.
"I well remember Ella," sad Mr. Hath
away recently. "She was like a sunbeam
in our home. She was always so happy,
so buoyant and so obliging. Never did
a cross word pass her lips and in her eyes
was always to- be seen the glint of merri
ment and good fellowship. She was self
reliant without being assertive; had the
courage of her convictions without being
demonstrative; was quick .at repartee,,
which never had the semblance of a sting, '
and possessed a heart that overflowed <â â 
with the milk of human kindness. We
all loved her as one of the family, and to
this day she is as a daughter to my dear
old mother. Often Ella has seized me and
has danced around the house with me un
til our strength would no longer permit us
to go further. Song came from her lips
like poetic pearlÃ have Bince dropped from
the point of her pen and as an impromptu
versifier I do not believe this country haa
ever .produced her equal. She was In great
demand at church fairs and other chari
table entertainments. Her subjects were
always chosen for her and often I have
known her to wait until only a few hours
separated her from her appearance be
fore shÂ© wrote her contribution. Even in
those early days she gave evidence of the
virility and sentiment that have marked
her writings during the past twenty years
and many of her productions found their
way Into magazines and newspapers and
later into volume collections.
â¢â¢In 1884 Ella married Robert M. Wllcox
of Meriden, Conn., and since then I have
not seen much of her. But notwithstand
ing that fame has laureated her and that
as the author of 'PoemÃ of Passion' and
'Poems- of Pleasure,' she has among her
friends people of world-wide celebrity, she
has not forgotten the friends of her child
hood. To her my mother was always May
and recently she found time to write a
few verses which are indicative of her
lovely nature and which Bhe dedicated to
and sent to my mother. I have a copy of
them, which has never before been pub
lished. It Is this:
There* a cunning: little woman
And but few know half her charms.
Shea the plumpest, whitest shoulder*
â¢ And such rounded taper arms.
She's such dainty little fingers
And her feet they are so small " <S
I sometimes sit and wonder y
How she Greta about at all. '
Her hairâ l can't describe It!
â 'Tisn't gold, or brown, or red. - "
Sometimes the ekies are colored
Like the curls upon her head.
If the gold of California . ' ,
Could be made to blush, I guess
'Twould exactly show the color
' Of each silken, curling tress.
. Tou can hear her singingâ singincâ
From the break of dawn till night.
And you'd think a flock of thrushes
â \Vere somewhere out of sight.
And if any one is gloomyâ
Or cross, or blue, or grim
Tou just want to bring him hither
And have her laugh for him.
AH the bells of Kt. James chiminr,
All the cymbals ever rung,
All the brooks that ever rippled,
... All the birds .that ever sunc,
Tou would say were at a discount â
Or together gave but half
The melody and muElc
. Of this little woman' Â» laugh.
She has been for years a Mn.
But it seems absurd to say
Such a word to such a mischief.
And so we call herâ May.
The years are passing o.'er her.
But the head of "blushing gold
Nods defiance at their changes,
And they cannot make her old.
If Father Time should meet her,
I know he'd scowl and frown
â¢VThen he saw how she denes himâ
- But she'd laugh his anper down.
And If he'd try to scold her
She'd take away his staff
| And go waltzing round the veteran
To the music of her laugh.
She has her cares and troublee,
As everybody must;
But she" laughs so much about them
That they leave her in diFgust.
She laughs about the weather, â¢
When it rains and when It snows, . 1
She lauphs because it's muddyâ "^
And she laughs because It blow*.
She is worth four hundred doctorsâ
To banish pains and aches. â¢
She sets her patients laughing-,
And disease goes off In shakes.
Are you sick or are you solemn-
Are you gloomy, are you blueT
Then you only need come hither
And have May lau^h for you.

Bachelors Are Useful.
Somebody with a grudge against the In
dispensable bachelorâ perhaps a design
ing maidenâ writes mf- as follows:
"Dear Madam: "When will you com
mence a series of letters concerning: the
Tse and Abuse of the Bachelor,' espe
cially the artistic abuse of the bachelor
sycophant, which may result in the elim
ination of the species?"
It would be an irreparable loss to elim
inate the bachelor from society. He is al
ways useful and often ornamental.
When the charming widow or attractive
belle Is visiting, her hostess depends upon
the bachelor to render the dinner or the
theater party a success.
College boys do very well at dancing
parties and widowers at whist, but no
body can take the bachelor's place at the
dinner table or In the theater box. He
is of greater value than the table decora
tions or the opera glasses.
A single man is always an object of
Interest to an unmarried woman. If he
has a reputation for being wholly invul
nerable to woman's charms she is all the
more pleased with him. If he is called a
dangerous flirt she is fascinated with the
thought of subjecting herself to his hyp
notic spell.
If he Is merely a fashionable beau she
likes to disport him as she would a mod
ish wrap.
If he is a desirable catch she likes to
bait her hook and try her powers.
In fact, there is scarcely any phase of
the bachelor which has not its interest for
unmarried women.

have lost, and then, in order to keep it
you will have to attend to it as regularly
as you do to your bathing.
Really, the reason why women are not
as well developed physically as they
should be is simply because they are such
a lazy lot. There! put that in your pipes
'and smoke it. \\ c fuss and fume over
dressmakers, milliners and hairdressers to

There are a couple of splendid gymna
siums here for women where they can
learn to perform on the trapeze and bars,
to vault and tumble, the same as their
husbands and brothers do, and you would
be surprised at the: diligence a few
months of tills sort of exercise will make
in a woman. The physical development
is so marked and the complexions so
brightened by the exercise that after a
short time some of the most puny ones
are scarcely recognizable. Fencing,
swimming arid swinging Indian clubs are
all taught In these gymnasiums, and are
especially excellent for developing the
muscles of the arms and increasing the
breadth and depth of the chest and shoul

develops the muscles of the nether limbs
as well.
However. If you do not care to go to the
' trouble or expense of going to a gymna

and go through your exercises at home in
your own little room.
" One of the very best exercises for de
veloping the muscles of the upper part
of the arm is to lie flat on the floor, face
downward, and raise the body on the
palms of the hands, as shown in the illus

For the thin and scrawny neck, the thin
nesa of which is frequently the result of
high collars, the following exercise will
be found beneficial:
First of all, assume a perfectly erect
position; place the hands on the hips and
then throw the head backward and for
ward ten or fifteen timesâ not violently,
but slowly and gently, as far front and as
far back as it will go each way. Then
move the head in the same way from side
to side the same number of timos. After
this twist the head around, describing a
perfect curve, first one way and then the
other ten or fifteen times. This will make
you dizzy; it may nauseate you until you
have become accustomed to it; but don't
you carp. Just (lose your eyes while you
are doing it and picture to yourselves the

of this exercise will bring to you. You

EXERGISES FOR DEVELOP^ THE MUSCLES OF UfPEJR ARJ^I.
Â» c . lf.v, which ls the only method by'
which the root can be killed, it is bound
to return and is more than likely to come
in coarser than it was before If the
growth ls too abundant to be removed by
the electric needle, then I know of noth
ing better to suggest than to stand pa
tiently before the mirror and pluck out
each hair, If it takes a month. Grasp.
thÂ£ tweezers firmly, give a straight, stilt
pull and the root of the hair will come
too. Then rub powdered pumlcestone
over th" place until the skin is tender '
After that give it a bath of weak alum
water, and as soon as it can bear it a
wash of pure lemon iuice. This is rather
severe treatment and will leave the skin
irritated for a time, but is really the most
efficacious method I can suggest. How
ever, the difficulty with the treatment is
that' unless you happen to extract the'
root of the hair it will break and scat
ter, and two or three hairs will come in
place of the one removed. The hftlrs arel
very likely to become coarser after using
the pumicestone, and its use has to be
continued, just as a man has to contin
ually shave himself. I really think it is
much better to let superfluous hair alone,
unless it Is very dark, when, by using
the peroxide of hydrogen, the hair N
made lighter and thus lrss perceptible.
MALHEUHEUXâ I have a brand new
recipe for freckles that may bring hnppf
ness to you, cherie. I; is this: s lak forty
grains of whole j;i;m tragacanlh in- seven
ounces i.f rosewater for two duys. !â  â â¢
until the lumps disappear, then add -half
an ounce of glycerin, one-half ounce of
alcohol, one dram of boracic acid and one
hair' dram pulverized alum. Dissolve
these last two ingredients In a
little hot water and mix with
alcohp! and glycerin before adding
to the jelly. Perfume, and, if too thick.
thin witli a little warm water. When
those bothersome little pimples come on
your nose treat th> m just as you hove
been treating them; also touch them with
a little listertne diluted in three thries na
much boiling water. Now. I would like
to say all sorts of nice thins? to you, in
reply to your very flattering little letter.
but, alas! there arc so many waiting -for
answers to their questions that 1 needs
must hurry along and make each reply
as brief as possible. One thing- T must
say. though, and that is that I am sure
you are a very dear little girl to know
and that we would lie the best of friends.
Now. write to me again, Mignonne. and
si^n yourself "Joyeuse" or something less
doleful than your present signature.
ADELINE ItrsSKi.l.â There really is
nothing that you can put on your hair to
darken it but a dye, and I should not r.d
vise you to attempt to use anything of
the kind yourself. If you will send me a
stamped addressed envelope I .will send
you the name of some one who does that
sort of work ami who will not use any
thing on your hair that can possibly in
lure it.
ADALJNEâ I think you will find the fol
lowing cucumber milk exactly wbat you
wish in the way of a lotion. It is delight
ful:
Oil of sweet almonds. 2 ounce?.
Fresh cucumber juice (boiled). 10 ounces.
White castile soap, one-auarter ounce.
dissolved in 3 ounces of essence of cu
cumbers and 38 drops of simple tincture
iif benzoin.
The .luice is got by boiling the cucum
bers in a little water, the essence by mix-,
ing the juice thus obtained with equal
parts of alcohol. Cut the cucumbers En I â 
thin slices, neither peeling nor removing
Hi- seeds and pour on lust enough v. â  r
to start them to cooking. When they are
soft an'i mushy it is time to remove them.
Strain first through a line sieve and then
through a cloth. A large botth â a gallon
oneâ comes in very handy when making
this lotion, as it must be shaken a great

hat your i ucumber juice is good and

n the lotion T think I would omit it from
he cold cream. The other ingredients
hat you mention a^e all right ami follow
ng are the proper proportions: Pure
vhite wax, ounce; spermaceti. IV*
iunces; sweet almond oil. lVi ounces; el
ler flower water, % ounce; tincture of

ilexion brush each night, followed by an
implication of the cold cream or the lo
ion. should end in refining the skin.
( '. M. X.â l am sorry, but I can sug
gest nothing for your trouble.
JOSEPHINE D.â lt is rather difficult
vhen doing one's own dishwashing to
teep the hands in good condition. If you
â an afford it, use castile soap for dlsh
vashing. I'se the following cold cream
or the hands: Spermaceti, one-half

weet almonds, two and one-half ounces;
osewater. three-fourths ounce; powdered

osewater and add the essence of clover,
tfelt the first three ingredient" in a por
elain kettle. When melted remove from
he heat and add the rosewater Call at
ince). Then beat quickly with an egg
>eater until the mixture is cold and firm.
M. H t S.â Try bleaching the discolored
mees with lemon juice or peroxide of
lydrogen. I really can suggest nothing
:fse.
El "GENT Aâ There are several recipes
riven in the letters to-day for cold cream.
?hey are all good, and of course you can
nake your cream as soft as you like by
idding more of the almond oil. The only
my to keep cold cream from .trotting ran
â¢id is to put up only a small quantity of
t at a time. You will find the following
otion a delightful water softener: Alco
-101, four ounces; ammonia, one ounce:
iil of lavender, one dram. Mix hy shak
ng in a six-ounce bottle. Add one teas
wonful of this, not a drop more, to two
juarts of warm water when you bathe
â¢our face. Re sure and measure the
inantity each time.
J. O. B.â The wrinkles that are dlstress
ng you are "worry" wrinkles. I am sure.
Jo, first of all you must stop worrying.
sever mind if the dinner is not ready Just
m time. If baby overturned the ink hot
le nil over his clean pinafore that you
ipent so much time ironing, don't y>u
lare. These are the very things that will
* -â¦- <J> -â¦- â $> -â¦_<$>- â¦_ $-Â»-<3.-Â»-<s>-Â»-+ Â» Â» â¦ #
bring the wrinkles, and plenty of 'em.
After you have succeeded in eliminating
worry make yourself a present of a nice,
big jar of orange flower skin food, form
. ula for which la given in reply to "Fu
ture." Rub this well into the face at
night until the flesh is all rosy from the
friction, taking care to rub across the
lines. The t!e<trie needle is the enly
thing that will kill the superfluous .lairs,
Eath< the eyes .In witch hazel, diluted
with warm water. This should do away
with the rings around them and also hÂ°!p
' the inllamed condition of the lids. To
plumper, the cheeks, massage with the
skin food, using a rotary upward and oul
v.i.id movement. To .enlarge the bu.-?t,
massage very gently for ten or fltteen
minutes each- nSght with equal part 3 of
cccoanut oil, lanoline imd cocoa, butter,
melted together. Pour a little of this
into the palms of the hands and rub
around and around. The discoloration on
your face, n,eck and ii.:: Is probably ans.L'3
from a disordered i ndition of the liver.
Remedy this by Internal medication and
then bleach the spots with lemon juice,
allowing it to dry on and smearing with
cold cream. The best way to grow plump
is to eat fattening foods, such as : rice,
potatoes, cereals, tggs, game, milk and
butter, and to avoid acids and very salted
or spiced foods. Drink mall or sweet
wine and no tea or coffee. Take moderate
exercise and all the rest you can get out
oi" this life of hurry and turmo.il. There,
I believe I hayÂ» not missed a. single ques
tion. If I have, or if there are any more
you wish to ask, write to me again. I
have a particularly soft gjpot in my heart
for . the "tired mothers" of this world.
You are such a patient, self-sacrificing,
long-suffering lot.
ALBERTAâ As long as your eyes are
weak I should not advise you to use any
thing en the lids. to make the lashes grow.
Instead Strengthen your eyes by bathing
them in a lotipn made by rubbing one tea
spoonful of pulverized boracic acid in fif
teen drops of spirits of camphor and pÂ»>r.r
ing over thi.s two-thirds of v, cup of hot
water. Stir and strain and use as needed.
There is only one sure. way of reducing
flesh, and that is to deny yourself all
fattening foods, to exerciÃe a lot and reg
ularly and to get around and hustle as if
something awful would happen if you
didn't. Get up early every morning. Nev
er sleep more than seven hours. Indulge
in walks and gymnastics everj spare mo
ment. You must not eat butter in any
form, and the more lemonade yoiJ drinJt
the better.
PETâ If you will use the orange flower
skin food, formula for which is given
at the end of the Beauty Talk, on
your chapped, rough skin, I feel, cer
tain it will improve it. Cocoa but
ter is very likely to have the effect you
fear. There is nothi better for black
heads than the complexion brush, used
wiht warm water and a little castile soap.
MRS. E. L.â Moth patches usually Indi
cate a derangement of the liver, in which
case Internal remedies, under the direc
tion of a Pkillfu! physician. are required.
If not induced by Internal causes they
may be removed'by the following: Kaolin
(monin), 4 grafts; lanoline, 10 grams;
glycerine. 4 grams; carbonate of mag
nesia, 2 grams; oxide of zinc, 2
grams. Apply to the discolored spot,
allowing y to dry on. A harmless dye for
the eyebrows is made after the following
fashion: Boil slowly an ounce of walnut
bark In a pint of. water for one hour.
"Set" the* dye by adding a lump of alum
size of a hazel nut. Keep this in a bottle
and apply to tlif eyebrows with a email
camel's hair brush. Be careful not to get
the liquid on the skin, as it will stain it.
and do not use on the eyelashes, as there
is danger of getting it in the eyes.
MKS. TOM X.â Systematic bathing and
exercise in th< open air are of much im
portance in effecting a cure for pimples.
Strict attention to the diet is also neces
sary. Avoid hot bread, pastry, cheese,
nut's, chocolate, and all sweet, fried and
highly seasoned foods. The sulphur lo
tion suggested to Elsa in last Sunday
Call may help you also. I can suggest
nothing "for the large ankles. J. O. B.
asked Ihe same question that you did
about the bust. Please read reply to her.
MOON DREAMSâ From your descrip
tion I am rather inclined to think that
your trouble is eczema of the scalp, in
which case I should not dare prescribe
for it. If. however, it be anything less
serious 1 feel sure the following tonic -will
help you: Four ounces eau de cologne,
one-half ounce tincture of cantharides
and one-fourth dram each of oil of lav
ender and -oil of rosemary. Apply to the
roots once or twice a day, using a small
sponge for the purpose. This tonic is
not at all oily, still, if you prefer one
without any oil. try this: Two drams
tincture cantharides, six ounces of es
sence of rosemary and eleven ounces of
elder flower water. Orange phosphates,
taken before meals, frequently has a
good effect upon the hair, keeping it
from falling in such terrifying quanti
ties, and it will also inspire it to more
ambitious growth. _â  '.. -; : /j-- â 
CLARISSA HOPEâ I must admit that
it's pretty tough to be getting wrinkles at
19 but never mind, little girl, just go at
them tooth and nail with some of that
lovely orange flower skin food -and I feel
perfectly certain that they will pick up
their duds and depart in a jiffy. The con
dition of your skin is no doubt caused hy
the dry climate of Arizona. The water,
too. is 'probably hard. That is a combina
tion that would ruin almost any sort of a
skin. Cannot you get distilled water? If
you cannot, then boi! the water that you
use for your face. The recipe for the skin
food Is given above. There is nothing
better for tan than sweet cream.
DAISY BELI.r- If you will send me a
Ptnmped addressed envelope I will tell you
where you can get the complexion brush.
Do you use a good cold cream on your
face after washing it with soap and wa
ter? I can suggest nothing for the finger
except to pinch it whenever you happen
to think of it. But. really, T should not
allow such a mere trif> as that to "worry
the life out of me." There are lots more
serious things ir. life to worry over than
an index finger that does not taper suffi
ciently to suit one's idc-as of symmetry.
Be cheerful. Keep your mind occupied,
and if there is nothing to do for yourself
try to think of something that . you can
do to help some one else and you will fina
that your "nerves" and your "worries"
will fly away like down before a good,
stiff breeze.

Wliat Pace Do You Travel?
The following is a very simple and easy
method of finding the pace at which you
arc traveling without the use of a cyclo-
meter. Note the numlx-r of revolutions
which the pedal cranks make in a given
number of secondsâ the number of sec-
onds in every instance depending upon
the gear of the bicycle. V ; . ,
For instance, a rider whose wheel is
geared to 66 goes as many miles per. hour
as his pedal cranks make revolutions in
11.7 seconds. If, with the gear at 66, the
cranks revolve just 11 times in 11.7 sec-
onds, the rider travels at the rate of 11
miles an hour. This little table may be
found convenient by those who wish to
compute their speed:

an adjournment to the banquet hall,
where covers were laid for 200, and every

The colony tract Is mostly timber land,

San Francisco Tent at Its regular re
view had a large attendance and after
the regular business there was spent a
pleasant hour under good of the order,
when there were songs, recitations,
yarns and a number of short talks by
members and by visitors, the latter allud
ing In complimentary terma to the rapid
growth of the tent. A committee was ap
pointed to arrange for a smoker to be
given on the 28th inst. The hustlers and
the rustlers announced that they would
soon make a good showing in the matter
of candidates.

As Is shown, one of these streams will

then wholly subside, all within three or
four days. That Is the work of rains and
thaws which fairly open the bunghole

few straggling trees are cut away. Of
this land 160 acres Is In standing timber
yet untouchedâ fir, cedar, spruce and
other trees. A peat marsh occupies 300
acres, most of which Is perhaps the rich
est land In the Western Hemisphere.
The remainder of the land has been
"logged off," as the woodsmen say, the
trees good for lumber and shingles hav
ing been taken away and immense stumps
and culled trees being left.
During the eighteen months of the col
ony's existence 100 acres of the low land
has been cleared of trees, and when gone
over with the stump puller will be ready
for cultivation. Some clearing has been
done on the town site and two large
apartment houses have be%n built. These
shelter a large number of the people. The
rest live in log houses and tents. The
building of small individual houses has
just begun.
The other buildings are a barn, 42x100,
and two stories high; a schoolhouse, 28x
68, with basement; a bakery, shop and
outhouses. The sawmill can cut about
20,000 feet a day at its nest, and the shin
gle mill from 20,000 to 40,000. A thlrty
tive horsepower donkey engine Is ÃBed to
haul logs to the mill and pull stumps.
There are also a wagon-shop, black
smith, cooper and iron-working shops,
shoe factory, tailoring, laundry and bar
ber-shop, and a fishery with a four-ten
sloop.
The government of Equality is as demo
cratic as socialists know how to make It.
The business i.- executed by a board of
director:- consisting of all the superin
tendents of the different departments of
labor. These men post their proceedings
which has taken up quarters in B"ne
B'rith Mall, initiated fourteen candidates
secured through the efforts of Deputy J.
A. Errnerins, w-ho since he took hold of
this tent about six weeks ago has in
cr< ased its in'inbership from thirty
seven to 102. In addition to those who
were Inducted into the mysteries of Mac
cabbeeism last Tuesday, ho ha? secured
a dozen nmre who want to join. There
is no tolling at this time how many more
be will have for next Tuesday. 1 The work
was performed by the new team of this
tent. It was the second time it gave the
work and the excellent manner in which
it was done was proof of the careful
study, under direction of Captain George
Morgan, the members thereof gave to thÂ«
long charges that have to be memorized
and to the various details necessary to
produce the dramatic effects of
the initiation. After the work the
team was rewarded with prolonged ap
l>lat:se as proof of the appreciation by the
members of the tent and visitors from
San Francisco Tent. At the cjose of the
work of the evening there was a pro
gramme of music, song and story telling
and the distribution of cigars.

Golden Gate Camp No. 64 last Mon

after the rains are done and the snows
begin to melt.
While the greatest steady volume of
water comes down In the spring, gener

on a public bulletin-board, subject to
change or referendum vote.
The working day In the colony la eight
hours, women five hours for the colony,
with the same pay. All adults have equal

"When we decide to Improve a street by
paving we first make it worse by digging
it up and getting ready to pave. Some!
have overlooked this fact in nature andj
have thus been disappointed in going to;
Equality. To succeed this movement re-;
quires Individuals who are on par with
its altruistic principles. It is quite notice-'
able that there are some here who, to<
repeat an expression of a member, 'Are;
made to order for this very work.' No
sacrifice Is too great for them if it aids,
the brotherhood of the co-operative com-'
monwealth.
"Of course, any rational mind would'
know that they are not all that way.
That some here are a hindrance Is not
surprising. Co-operative labor is not so

INDEPENDENT FORESTERS.
The entertainment that was recently
given in Odd Fellows' Hall was one of
the best drawing cards that this order has
over given in this city. Nearly 1400 gen
tlemen responded to the Invitations issued
and each was accompanied by one or
more ladies, so that the hall was as
crowded as it could possibly be. The ex
cellent addresses delivered that night
awakened much interest in the order.

KNIGHTS OF HONOR.
Last Monday night Liberty Lodge was
visited by Anchor Lodge In a body. There
was work in the Initiatory degree and
Grand Dictator Archibald addressed tho
meeting.
Terba Buena, havirg an excess of 200
members, is how the banner lodge. It has
fifteen applicants awaiting Initiation.
There was a large attendance at the
visit of Eureka and Anchor lodges to Oc
cidental last Wednesday. There was a
pleasant evening of music, songs and ad
dresses. The speakers were: Benjamin
I. Salomon, grand assistant dictator; B.
F. Joy, grand trustee; I. D. Martin of
Occidental and Joseph Schulte of Mon
terey.
The action of the recrnt Grand Lodgf in
increasing the per capita tax for the pur
pose of extending the work of the order
has $yen general satisfaction.
The grand dictator has appointed the
following standing committees: Finance â
George Walcom of No. 150."., 11. M. Beck
of 2366 and Jacob Gans of 184 L Lawsâ J. S.
W. Saunders of 2204, Philip Prior of 3227
and Willis Parris of 292',. Appeals and
grievancesâ H. K. McLennan of 15S0,
James Haneen of 1716 and J. L. Peareau
of 2058. The names of the deputies will
' be announced in a few days.
The watchword of the grand officers for

former the laborer gets all his product
and by the latter probably less than one

Equality Colony is too young yet to

mean discharge was 11.799 secorid-feet or

Dramatic Criticism
TIIF jollity of the town is consid
erably rr.hanced these d.iys by
a row th.it is on betwÂ» en Beveral
ne'wspa] 1 theati rs.
Perhaps you have noticed that
the Evening Report and some of the
â weeklies are giving: it hot and heavy
to the shows at the Columbia, Alcazar,
Tivoli and Chutes? If not you have
missed some precious reading â the
rieh< since the old days when the
Examiner waged war against the Bald
win and toasted every show, pood, bad
and splendid, that was housed by that
theater. I used to think that yours
truly was sometimes rather difficult to
please In the matter of plays and play
acting; but since the managers of the
Columbia, Tivoli, Chutes and Alcazar
have conspired to withhold their ad
vertising patronage from all of the
weeklies and one of the evening' dailies,
and most of these papers have retali
ated in the true commercial spirit, I
have come to regard myself as the
most docile and- g natured person
who ever sped a pencil on the subject
of the playhouse. The News Letter
and the Argonaut and The Wave have,
to be sure, kept calm and critical even
in th< face of. their great loss, which
1 understand amounts to several dol
lars a week to each paper. But the
asp has a thousa stingers out for
the unadvertised attractions: Town
Talk is simply sulphuric in ita lndin
nation; and the wrath of the Report
knows jio limit. Town Talk toasts not
only the shows but th< manag< as
well. Mr. L 'any, who controls the af
fairs of the Tivoli, is reminded in that
paper of the time when he was erely
the manager of a furniture factory.
The Wasp says: "If there had been
opera houses in Job's day it ('Golden
Locks') would have been a beautiful
thing to try the respected old gentle
man's patience on." But the critics of
th^ weeklies are press agents compared
to the relentless scribe who â  winjca the
lash for the Report. Listen to this,
from Tuesday's issue of that paper:
"Stevens or the Yellow Wig." rwlÂ»e
hilled as "Reautiful Golden Locks," con
tinues to keep audiences iway from the
Tivoli. As that place is a dangerous lire
trap, the ploce at leaat servt-s one good

I don't believe that at any other time
in the history of the town there has
been such a rush of uncomplimentary
dramatic criticism. Plays are slated
ripht and left, tors receive rebukes
heside which ancient epps would l>e

at the Grand Opera-house and produco
"Ermiine," Jarobowskl's prettiest opera.
As it la a long- v.hlle since it was produced

coming production should be successful,
especially as it will introduce a very
strong cast that will contain every mem
ber of the company in. every perform
ance. This will be the cast: Erminie,

i eerve, the gain for the seven days ending with
i â¢\prii 15 having been almost four and one-half
millions. The highest point attained in the '
â  â  attei of excess cash during the current year
was on the first date named, when the, sur- j
j plus was over $3,000,000, as against $iy,4i1,025 .
I now.
; But the interim has been marked by an ex
! panslon ol $42,000,000 In loans and 827,000,000 in
I deposits, In addition to the Increased reserve j
I requirement*! due to enlarged deposit liabili
ties, the banks have lost rather heavily to the
interior. Now that this movement is at an
end and the loans are showing a decreasing
; tendency, Bhe normal result favors a rising
percentage of rage reserves and correspond- :
I Ingly easy money market.
In addition to the causes named the payment :
1 of the Philippine Indemnity will have the effect â 
of tnporarily adding to the surplus cash in |
banks, Bince the payment as contemplated at
pn-snnt involves a transfer of the cash to the ,
â  banks in purchase of exchange, the i;!y offset
being the million dollars weekly which the Sec
retary proposes to call from public depositories, â¢
It will be seen that every factor is operating
to i-Tennthrn the position of the New York In
stitutions, Of the changes in the current state
' merit the moÂ«t Important is the contraction of
$10,3r.2.2rx) n loans, due in part to Utp heavy*
liquidation of the past ten days and to opera
tions Incident to the financing of several heavy
transactions. The loan contractli n has ha I the
natural effect of reducing deposit liabilities, anj j
the decrease of 86,486,400 is to be thus ac- '
counted for. This slirinlca<;Â»- reduced the re
! Berve requirement* by 51,62i,6<j0, and a* the gain !
' In cash was t2,BSLIOO the actual reserve Is
I $4,432,700 heavier than for the. previous week.
Wlil'.e. as stated, everything favors an easy
1 prospect for funds. it Is not to be Inferred that
. the market will be the borrowers, since the In
! stitutions are exercising considerable caution
I In advancing money on Industrials, although,
! as a matter of fact, this is not the result of a
I sudden determination, but rather the enforcing
of a policy which to a greater or less extent has
been operative for some time.

but firm at unchanged prices. Early crop news
wap of a puzzling nature, but later in the day
the " reports became worse than ever, v/hilo
the dry weather was suggestive of still mere
damage. A private cablegram from Berlin in
dicated a possibility of. Russia prohibiting ex
ports of grain on account of . famine. This
announcement, together with the depressing
character of the home crop Information, im
| parted some courage to buyers, and for a time
i the market exhibited an upward tendency.
I The pressure to sell May wheat became quite
1 urgent at times, nnd the early strength grad-
I ually disappeared. May opened at 73^4@73Uc,
I nnd closed at 72%@72Â»ic. July, after an ad
vance to 74Vj.c, reacted to 73% c and closed at

Harrison's circular says: "During the week
there have been three arrivals of coal from
British Columbia with 12,010 tons; two from
Washington, 64W tons; two from Oregon, 823
tons; total. 13, 05S tone. No changes to note in
the fuel line this week; business generally is
reported g,uiet and prices remain steady. The
quantity received here st> far this month la
very light, being about two-thirds of the actual
amount consumed. We have not had a delivery
of foreign coal for three weeks, clearly show
ing that the coast deliveries make us almost In
dependent for luel, and that no famine would
be created if we were without any foreign ar
rivals. Of course, If outside fuel was not im
ported, consumers would be forced to pay high
er prices, as the coast producers would natur
ally increase values if Australia and Great
Britain did not regulate selling prices. Con
â¢ siderable guessing is being done as to the ef
fect to be produced on the luture market, when
grain carriers commence to head this way to'
move our crops. Their incoming cargoes will
probably consist, of fully 75 per cent coal, and
this . should naturally tend to disturb values
somewhat. This is shaped entirely by the
rates of freight they will receive for handling
our grain; If they are liberal, ' coal will be
lower, if not, there will be no marked de
cline." .

their cruel heads; but all in vain. The wild beasts could not be

and running more and more swiftly, carried them away.
" said the magician, Al Araaf. as he dreamed, "I see that this

swim In blood, and that the wild beasts shall not remain to occupy the
land after all the giants are gone forever. That will be all the better
for me. for then I will own all the land, and there will be neither man
nor beast to dispute me."
THE CAMEL AND THE
TREE THAT RAN AWAY
ONCE upon a time there lived In
a gr> -a poor old one-eyed
camel. He waa very very old; so
he could barely move about.
There was not much to eat or
much to drink in this desert, but every
here and thore grew a blade of grass,
and occasionally there was found a
of water, and by constantly mov-
Ke around the old fellow managed to
get something to eat and also some
thing to drink.
I me day while in search of his cub-
tomary blade of grass and drink of
â water he saw nway oft' In the distance
a tree. At the Bight of it his only eye
lit up with great pleasure, for he knew
where there was a tree there are a lot
of trees, and where there are a lot of
trees there is a lot of grass, and where
there is a lot of grass there is a lot of
â water, and where there is a lot of water
there are a lot of camels. That is what
made the poor old forlorn camel so hap
py, and he gave a loud cry of Joy and
Btarted off as fast as he could toward it.
And he ran, and he ran, and he ran.
And he ran all that day and all the next
day, but, much to his surprise, got no
nearer to it.
"Well." he =aid to himself, "that is a
remarkable funny tree. I have run aa
as I could for two days and one
night, and it seems as far off as ever."
Then ho stopped and took a good look
at it.
"Yea, it is a suro enough tree, but one
can see so far in the desert that I have
misjudged the distance. But I think
far away from it now,
and I will try again."
S> once more he ran toward it.

lie ran all that day and all the
next day, but still got no nearer to it.
He attain stopped ana looked at It.
"It is a tree, sure enough," he said,
"but why don't i < to 11 .'" And he
prratrhed his head with his left hind
hoof.
"I muFt be dreaming," he again said,
whfn he looked and r.till saw th-
Just ahead of him. He shut his eye for
HIS Is another part of the Btory
found In the parchment con
cerning: which Omar wrote. It
tells of the dreams of Al Araaf,
the magician, who elept while
Prince I Don't Care and Blood
flllikln, his hound, were draw-
Ing near to the Castle of Al
Kabo. It Is aIBO the Btory of
what came of those dreamÃ of
the magician. Now, upon the
right hand of Al Araaf there
was a magic ring for protection.
"U"h*Â»n the senees of Al Araaf
were asleep the ring kept his
mind busy. As he fell upon the
castle floor the magic ring
struck upon a sword that stood
behind a curtain, and the sword
wounded the magician's hand bo
that he bled. And the blood
touched the garments of the
slumbering mice, and they were
nil turned to a fiery red, and
the magic of Al Araaf was with
them from that moment.
a few moments and again looked. It
was still there.
Then he scratched his head again,
and this time with his right hind hoof,
and then he started for It once more.
And he ran, and he ran, and he ran.
And he ran all that day and all next
day, but still got no nearer to it.
he gave It up, and seeing a blade
of grass and a drink of water he made
haste to eat his supper.
Then he lay down to sleep, and, much
to his surprise, the tree lay down, too.
"That is a strange tree," said the cam
el, and he got up, and the tree also got
up.
That tickled the camel bo he laughed,
and the tree laughed, too, which so
Btartled the old fellow that he Jumped
sideways. Then the camel movedback
ward, and the tree moved forward.
Then the camel-moved forward, and the
tree moved backward, and they kept
this backward and forward movement
up all night, and in the morning the
camel got mad and again ran after the
tree. . â¢ â¢â 
And he ran, and he ran, and he ran.
And hf- ran all that day and all the next
day, but pot no nearer to It.
I guess I will ~'ve It up," he said.
-y, very tired, so he lay down
and went to sleep, but before he closed
his eyes he saw the tree Uf dow.n too.
The old fellow was so worn out that
h>- Blept for five days and nights, and
when he awoke he still saw the tree
lying down, but he decided to pay no
more attention to It. When he arose,
the tree also arose.
Then, much to his surprise, the tree
camp toward him, and very soon came
to where he was. Then the tree bowed
very low and politely, and said: "Good
morning. Mr. Camel; how are you?"
The camel also bowed politely and an
swered: "I am very well, I thank you.
But why did you run away from me?"
"Why did you run after me?" asked
the tree.
"I ran after you," said the camel,
"because I saw you, and knew where
THE SAN FKANCTSCO CATX, SUNDAY, APRTL If?, 1899.
The CASTLE
of AL KABO.
And Al Araaf, the wicked, dreamed again. The red flood was gone
away and the land was bare once more. Into the sea every tree and
every castle that had belonged to glar*-- "nd all the fields had been
pwept by the flood. The poll that had borne fruitful crops was all
gone, and below, where the soil had been, was only a world of stone.
In all directions were awful mountains of solid black, rocks and valleys
of flint, In all of which was no living thing. "It does not matter," eaid
the magician. "I will go hence upon my magic carpet and Journey until
I find the Rlessed Islands, which are surrounded by a high wall, made
so stout by the magicians who live there that not even the sea can
break through it. There I will feast and dwell."
And Al Araaf, the wicked, dreamed again. Behold, he had Jour-
neyed over the seas and had entered Into the Blessed Islands. Flower
ing gardens and fruit-laden orchards of the apple and the orange and
peach and plum and cherry, and all other fruits of the earth, were
there. He saw his brother magicians, who came forward to greet him
and to tell him that this should be his home. And he was happy, and
never thought once of all the unhappy ones in other parts of the world
who hail lost their homes and their all and were In distress, for he
was wicked. There was upon the Blessed Islands a King of Magicians,
who waa very bad-tempered. To him came Al Araaf and quarreled.
Filled with anger against Al Araaf was the King, and he counseled
with his friends what to do. It was not possible to send Al Araaf
away; nor would the mag-ie arts of the King- work against Al Araaf
without bringing trouble upon all the magicians, for he was the great
est of them all excepting the King. Wherefore Al Araaf, having
learned of this determined to make the King a prisoner in a
there is a tree there are a lot of trees,
and where there are a lot of trees there
Is a lot of grass, and where there is a
lot of grass there is a lot of water, and
where there is a lot of water there are
a lot of camels. That la why I ran after
you, Mr. Tree."
"I know where there are a lot of
trees," said the other, "and if that is
all you want I will take you to them."
The two started off, and they walked
and they walked and they walked all
that day and all next day, but still saw
no trees. And .the poor old camel got
very, very tired. The tree tried to
cheer him up. "We will surely find them
ti.-nifTiMw." But they walked all that
day and all the next day and the day
uftÂ»r and the day after that, but still
saw no trees.
After a good night's rest the tree
persuaded the camel to try again, and
mountain cave deep under the sea. He opened a great chasm where
the King would pass, and when the King fell in he closed up the
ground and spnke such words over it that even the King was not able
to break the spHl and get out. Then once more Al Araaf rejoiced, for
all the other magicians were compelled to do his bidding, and he was
the King while he should keep the rightful King a prisoner.
"It is as easy," he said, "to put out a King of Magicians from his
islands as it was to trick the giant Abraminidln out of his castle. And
Al Araaf was very proud of his skill and wickedness.
And Al Araaf dreamed again. He was the King of the Magicians
upon the Dieted Island; but he was not at ease. The King, who
was imprisoned in the cave under the sea, would not rest until he
could secure his own once more, and from hie prison He was able to see
Al Araaf, and knew all that he did. His charms were not enough to
disturb Al Araaf. "Wherefore the King, in hla anger, burning hotly,
said: "I will rend open the earth, even down to Its innermost and most
awful fires; into this cavern I will let In the sea. The water of the sea
shall fill the middle of the earth. The water shall turn into steam, and
the steam shall burst open the roof of my prison, and all the Blessed
Islands shall be destroyed, since I can no more reign In them. It Is
well; for vengeance upon Al Araaf must be mine. He shall not reign.
Vngrateful Al Araaf, to whom I gave a home and who has robbed me
of my power and cast me into a dungeon!" Filled with fury, the King
worked day and night for many days; but on'y when Al Araaf slept.
The King saw the dismal fires in the heart of the earth glowing with
white heat, and then, the hour having come, ho let in the sea to his
cave. The waves rushed in with loud, glad voices and leaped In a sheer
fall, and with a mighty shock, far down into the earth.
The cave was fllkd with steam, which, being imprisoned, shook the
earth wtth a great Bound and commotion. High as the skies the rocky
roof of the cave was hurled. All the earth trembled to Its foundations.
Not one stone was left upon another of all the mlphty castles of the
plants in all the world. Rent wide apart by the shock, the Blessed Isl
ands crumbled Into the sea and disappeared. Al Araaf, swimming in
the sea, which, was now one terrible whirlpool strewn thickly with
jagged rocks, made his way painfully to an island, around which the
waters surged fearfully. If he had refused to seek safety he might
have been still a great magician, but when he sought to save himself,
j'.:st as any ordinary man might do, his magic left him, and he wept.
'And Al Araaf dreamed again. There was a mighty Prince who
came to a high castle, and, beating upon the castle gate with the hilt
of his sword, ordered it to swing upon Its hinges; but it was steadfast
and would not move. Then the Prince fastened a knot of black cloth
to his sword hilt and commanded:
"Open, in the name of the Black Robe!"
Then the gate was opened by itself, and the Prince came Into the
courtyard of the castle and drew near the castle door, and having seen
that the castle was grown full of poppies he shouted:
"Come out. Giant Abraminidln, great coward that you are, and
fight Prince I Don't Care, who is here!"
And th^n Al Araaf saw the giant Abraminidin come in through the
castle gale.
"Die, dwarf!" shrieked the giant, as he ran forward, trying to
they walked half a day, when the tree
said: "I see them now, I think. But let
me get on your back and I will be able
to see much plainer."
The camel knelt, as requested, and
the tree got on his back and wrapped
his roots around him. Then he told the
poor old fellow he saw the trees a little
off to the right.
The camel looked and looked and
looked, but could pee nothing. "That 18
because I am higher than you," eald the
tree. "But If you walk real fast we will
get to them before night."
They started off, and at first the old
camel was so happy to know they were
so near the trees he forgot all about the
load on his back. But toward night he
became so tired he could hardiy drag
his feet along, and he begged the other
to get off, but the tree refused to do
so. "Why should I get off?" he said. "I
am tired of walking, and as I am show
ing you the way you ought to carry
me."
The poor camel was tired too, but he
thought It a fair bargain, and kept on
until dark. But still they saw no trees,
and he wanted to He down and rest, but
the selfish tree refused to let him.
The old fellow begged and begged and
bf^pjed. but the tree would not get off.
Then the camel lay down and tried to
roll the other off, but failed.
Then the tree Bald: "You had better
move on." And the camel said, "I will
not!" And the tree said, "You will, or
I will choke you!" "You will be hanged
if you do," said the camel. "I will be
hanged if I don't," swore the tree.
Then the camel lay down again, and
the tree choked the poor old fellow, and
was hanged, just as the camel said he
would be. R. W. RIGGS.
strike Prince I Don't Care with % swotA.
"Ha! Ha!" lauphed Prince I Don't Care merrily, as he ran behind
a hugr Tebo tree, which was so large that a regiment might have
made their camp under the shade of its branches.
Ar< und and around the Tebo tree nimbly ran Prince I Don't Care,
an 1 the giant. Abraminidin followed until he was out of breath, but
never catching up with the Prince. When the giant was tired he sat
down upon a stump of a tree to rtst, and the Prince sat upon the
gTOund and laughed at the giant.
"Ho, ho! lazy bones 1" cried the Prince. "You are slower than thÂ«
â nails are in my land. Who ever told you that you could run?"
Then Abramlnidin was furious, and called upon his brother, Hard
flst, who had Just come in through the castle gate, to seize Prince I
Don't Care. Now the boasting Prince was a prisoner once again.
"I don't care," said the little man, "this may be a new adventure."
The two giants would have killed Prince I Don't Care then and
there, but Abraminidin saw that the castle doors and castle windows
were filled with poppies.
"Come, brother, let us solve this mystery first, and then we will
look out for the little Prince," said Abraminidin to Hardflst. But the
g-iants did not get far. The smell of the poppies put them to sleep, for
the poppies still had power over giants, and they fell upon the floor of
the castle. Then they wore at the mercy of Prince I Don't Care.
The Prince did not draw his sword. "Tush," he said, "I will wait
until they awake before I fight the giants. But, now, let me see what
all this meanÃ. Lot me play fair, whatever happens!"
You will understand that Prince I Don't Care could not be put to
slejp by the r.orpies any more, and as he was not afraid of ali the
giants on earth he took the chance of their waking as he boldly cut
his way into the castle among the poppies with his sword.
This last dream of Al Araaf was real. The Prince soon found him,
and by the use of the knot of cloth on his sword hilt, which was a
piece of the Black. Robe, succeeded in making him open his eyes. Up
jumped the magician, now wide awake, the popples having been de
stroyed by the Prince, and Al Araaf shouted:
"Who are you?"
"Prince I Don't Care, at your service."
The magician threatened the Prince. At the same Instant, there
being no more poppies to make them sleep, Prince r Don't Care having
destroyed the plants, the two giants came running swiftly up the castle
stairs. Prince I Don't Care was therefore threatened by the two
giants on one Bide and by Al Araaf upon the other. Above the head of
the magician the sword of light once more sparkled. That was a dan
gerous time for the Prince. D. H. W.

A QUIET CHAT WITH
OUR YOUNG FRIENDS
Y~U did not all guess all the puz
zles last weekâ not by any
means. That will be made clear
to you by the correct answers,
which are given as follows: Sac
ramento, Auburn, Bakersfield, Truckee,
Grass Valley (valet), Millbrae (bray),
Tres Pinos. Tour failures were mostly
with the names Grass Valley and Tres
Pinos. Those were somewhat hard to
find out. The idea was to give only
the names of very well known Cali
fornia towns. This week you may pur
sue your studies in the geography by
making out the names of California
mountains as they are herewith plc
turÂ« d. Here is the roll of honor for last
â week :
Allle Akin, 8062 Twenty-fourth street,
Ban Francisco (Allle polved the town
names puzzles and also the Revolutionary
War nami's puzzle correctly): Edith
Searle, 2115 Alameda avenue, Alameda;
Howard Taylor, 524 William street, Oak
land; Raymond de Sanno, Vallejo; Olivia
Wright, Berkeley; Esmeralda Church,
San Francisco; Gertrude Lang-staff, 173
Tremont avenue, San Francisco; Hazei
Brier, 1116 Thirteenth street, Sacra
mento; Theodore Smith, 1303 Seventh
avenue. East Oakland; Carrie G. Bur
bank, 17C1 Alcatraz avenue. Lorin; Lulu
Schrooder, Alameda; Grace Lloyd, 2E 7
Butter street, San Francisco; Mamie
Fitzgerald, Gilroy; Hazel Allen, Lincoln,
Cal.; W. C. Culbert. 210 Turk street, San
Francisco; Hazel Watsorr San Francisco;
LuellaÃhubert, Red Bluff; Elmo Bennett,
Crllroy; Emeile Houston, E>2 Silver street,
San Francisco- Jean McCloud. 2522 Cali
fornia street, San Francisco; Leita Rob
erts, 932 Dolores street, San Francis-.);
Edna Prosek, 508 Hermann street, San
Francisco; Henry A. Hussey, Vallejo;
Minnie Krrps. Petaluma; Bertha Mar
, cum, Valle.io.
Dora P. Coon, Folsom, Cal.; James S.
Greer, 4120 Twenty-fourth street, San
Francisco; Edna Rain!'.. Alvarado; and
Mabel Nutting, San Francisco.
Howard Antrim, 2531 Tost street. San
Francisco, guessed all the puzzlea with
one exception; Nannie Scott, 1117 Fol
som street. Ban Francisco, and Carrie
Austin, 24 Perry street^ found that puzzle
No. 5 was probably Tomales, but were
correct on all the other puzzles, so the
Joke is on the designer of the puzzles,
who confesses that he had no thought of
a tamale outfit when he planned that
puzzle; Gertrude Harries, 1361 Jack
eon street, Oakland, made No. 6 Vallejo,
but had all the others right; Viola Han
sen of Redwood City answered all cor-
rectly but one: Philip Zlpf of Grass Val
ley oddly enough failed to recognize his
own town, but made out all the others.
Others who were right with one excep
tion are: Paul Turner. Santa Rosa; Ger
trude O'Keefe, 195 West St. James street,
San Jose; Ali.-t- Partington, 1121 Eddy
Btreet, San Francisco; Amanda Her
mann, 1139 Shotwell street, San Fran
cisco. One of our puzzlers sent In a
nearly correct list from 1630 Eddy street,
and forgot to send his (?) name.
Two llttlo girls, seeing a picture of two
men walking in the town names (puzzles)
figured out that the name was San Joa
qiiin" (walkln 1 ), which was very ingenious,
truly.
Stories written by George "W. Slmonton
of Vallejo, Cal.; Isabel Wllkie. 4IÂ« Oak
street, San Francisco, and Robbie Rhodes,
Uklah, Cal., will be published.
Viola Hanson of Redwood City pends
the following answers to her Revolution
