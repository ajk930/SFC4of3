LAWTON WILL MAKE
AGUINALDO PRISONER
MANILA, March n, 3:15
p. m. â Extensive preparations
are being made for a general ad
vance of the American forces.
The movement will probably
take place early next week.
All is quiet, however, along
the line. At daylight the
rebels were caught working
on enfilading a trench at
Caloocan and were shelled by a
battery. Desultory firing also
took place at San Pedro Macate.
The United States cruiser
Charleston has relieved the arm
ed transport Buffalo, off Pa-
ranaque.
The last batch of Spanish sol
diers, numbering 885 men, ex
cepting a few who are in the hos
pitals, were embarked on board
the transport Buenos Ayres to
day.
A battalion of the Fourth
Regular Infantry has been sta
tioned on the firing line, assigned
to General Macarthur's division.
The others have been held in re-
serve and are encamped on the
Luneta parade ground. A bat
talion of the Seventeenth Regu
lars has been assignee^ to provost
guard duty, relieving the Oregon
Volunteers. During a rainstorm
which occurred before daylight
this morning the rebels on the ex
treme left fired several volleys at
the Americans, but without ef
fect.
WASHINGTON, March 11.â When
the War Department closed at
4 o'clock this afternoon, it was
said that there was no infor
mation at hand from Manila throwing
light on the condition of affairs there,
but it is admitted that exciting news
ls expected at nearly any minute. By
this time it is supposed that General
Lawton has been able to get a firm
grasp on the trend of events there, and
to make his plans for an aggressive
movement.
It develops that General Otis, in his
noisaance in force last week,- dis
covered it would be dangerous to ex
teijd his lines too far, and for that
reason decided to wait for General
Lawton's arrival. The latter had been
notified while in the Mediterranean of
the attack of the Filipinos on the
American troops and had received a
dispatch when at Ceylon that his pres
ence was eagerly desired. Accordingly,
the transport was put at full speed and
the 3000 miles that intervened were run
over in twelve days. During this time
General Otis did all the preliminary
work looking to a forward movement.
It is said at the War Department
that General Lawton will probably be
allowed by General Otis to make his
own plans, on the ground that he will
be held responsible for their success.
General Otis is thought to be too exper
ienced to attempt to control the move
ment of the troops in the field from
Manila, where it is expected he will
remain to keep general supervision over
all the many islands in the Philippine
group. To attempt this would be to
repeat the mistakes of the Board of
Strategy, which excited so much ridi
cule during the war.
General Lawton's record as an Indian
fighter, dating from his long pursuit
and capture of Geronlmo, has been
comprehensive and extensive, and h_
Is thought to be the best man for the
Job. His training in Indian fighting, in
fact, has peculiarly fitted him for his
present command, and General Otis is
well acquainted with his capabilities.
One of Lawton's numerous Indian
sobriquets, being literally translated, is
"The man who gets up and fights in
the middle of the night." It was his
sunrise dash into Siboney that sent the
Spanish detachment there flying to La
Guasimas, leaving its breakfast on the
fire for the American troops to eat.
The department fully expects Law
ton to spring a few like surprises on
the Filipinos and is awaiting news of
the field campaign with proportionate
Interest. He will, it is said, use every
means of warfare licensed by civilized
nations, including the devastation of
the country, if this is thought neces
sary, to secure a speedy termination of
the rebellion. Aguinaldo will be starved
out if he canrlot be captured by any
other means.
Meanwhile the Government is not re
laxing its endeavors to strengthen the
forces in the Philippines. The Ninth
Infantry is ordered to sail from San
Francisco on March 21, on the Zealan
dia and City of Puebla, and the Sixth
Artillery is to be ready to follow on
April 16. These two regiments had al
ready received their orders for service
In the East, and the new orders merely
show that the Government has made
the necessary arrangements for trans
ports. What shall be done with the re
turning transports is a question that
has been left open until the situation
has further developed itself. If the re
bellion seems to be nearing an end they
will return to the United States loaded
with volunteers for muster out. If
nothing definite comes up, or if the
trouble seems likely to be prolonged,
they will probably be held at Manila to
bring back the volunteers when they
are no longer needed.
No one at the department is worrying
over Spain's delay in ratifying the
peace treaty, because until she does the
United States can retain all the volun
teers without any to do about It. When
tbe treaty is ratified, unless matters

have been greatly exaggerated. One year, however, in this eastern cli

earned rest.

WASHINGTON, March 11.â The War

MARK HANNA OFFERS
A LOAN TO CUBANS
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1399, by James Gor
don Bennett.
HAVANA, March 11.â A loan of
; $12,000,000 offered the Cuban Assembly
' for the payment of the army, now being
j discussed in secret session, has been
i proposed by an influential group of
i American capitalists. At the head of
1 this group are said to be Mark Hanna
j and Mr. Runkle. The proposition first
came through Senor Quesada, and was
put before the leaders of the Assembly
on his visit here with Mr. Porter. In
return for the loan the Assembly Is
asked to pledge the Cuban -revenue for
repayment in twenty years, with inter
est from year to year; and a commission
of 5 per cent on the original loan to the
negotiators of the present transaction.
The consent and. approval of the
United States to this alienation of the
island's revenues is not required by the
lenders. All that is asked is the pass
ing by the Assembly of a formal reso
lution guaranteeing repayment accord
ing to the terms stated. The Assembly
has wrangled for more than a week
over the proposition. While a majority
ls in favor of accepting, there is a
strong minority who have behind them
the influence of Gomez. This faction
protests vigorously against the pro
posal.. They say It is of a scandalous
nature. There appears to be little
doubt, however, that the Assembly will
pass It by the vote required.
ENGLISHMEN BERATE
AMERICAN LOCOMOTIVES
Action of the Great Midland in Order
ing Engines Here Stirs Up
Bitter Comment.
Special Cable to The Call and the Xew York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, March 11.â The action of the
Great Midland Railway in ordering loco
motives from America has stirred up quite
an uneasy feeling among English engi
neers. In an interview in the Westmin
ster Gazette with the chairman of a firm
of British locomotive manufacturers that
gentleman says:
"Yankee engines are Infinitely inferior
in quality. Their service ability is quite
temporary compared with that of English
locomotives. Their valve motions are not
nearly so nicely finished. Their fittings
are hastily pieced together, and they burn
much more fuel, but they are cheaper and
can be delivered in much less time. Amer
ica can turn out an engine in three to five
months, while we take twelve at the in
side."
The Westminster Gazette then asks the
question: "Can engines built In three
months in America be safe iron horses
for British lines?"
It seems to me that builders of great lo
comotives which pull fast limited train*?
on the Pennsylvania and New York Cen
tral roads can answer that question very
satisfactorily. _^

WAR SECRETS
IN SPANISH
RED BOOK
President McKinley, Not
Spain, Wanted to Go
On Fighting.
PHILADELPHIA, March 11.â The
Philadelphia Inquirer prints this morn
ing this story, purporting to come from
its correspondent in Washington: ;7 7
"The famous red book of Spain, re
plete with the secrets of the Spanish
Government, has reached the United
States through a secret channel. The
publication of any matters contained
in this book is prohibited by law in
Spain. The book is not printed ,for
public perusal.
"It shows the inside workings of a
plan to have M. Cambon, the Embassa
dor of France at Washington, sound
the American Government as to its
terms of peace, and brings out the cu
rious fact that when M. Cambon pre
sented his instructions to President
McKinley, after having taken the
trouble to have them deciphered out of
the private cipher of the Department
of State for Spain, the Embassador
found that the American President had
been apprised of his instructions re
ally in advance of the Embassador, and
knew their contents even down to the
minutest letter.
"This, taken in conjunction -with
other things brought out in the book,
shows that very early in the war the
Americans had some underground plan
for obtaining Spanish official docu
ments and could read the Spanish na
val, military and State ciphers as
readily as the Spanish themselves.
"The letter of Embassador Cambon
to the Spanish Minister of State ex
presses intense surprise that the Amer
ican President should have been made
acquainted with all the little details
of his instructions.
"Embassador Cambon thought that
President McKinley was* anxious to
continue the war when Spain accepted
the American terms. Under date of
August 7, M. Cambon cabled to Mad
rid:
Senor Duke: I called at the White
House to-day by special .'invitation of the
President. 1 Informed the Secretary of
State of the receipt of your cable of Au
gust 7 In which you acquaint me with the
fact that Spam accepts the onerous terms
imposed by the United States. The Presi
dent and his Secretary of State appeared
to be much disappointed that Spain had
accepted the terms, it seeming to be ap
parent that they thought Spain would re
ject them and America might have a
greater excuse for forcing the war to
the end. ..''.,
After a long silence Mr. McKinley said:
"I asked of Spain the immediate ces
sion and evacuation of Cuba and Porto
Rico. Instead of sending to me a cate
gorical reply, I am given a general note.
The Spanish Government declares that it
cannot give the answer I desire until the
Cortes has been consulted. I cannot con
sider such a proposition."
1 observed that the Spanish Queen had
no greater authority than the American
President, and called his attention to his
previous statement that all the conclu
sions of the Peace Commissioners would
have to be accepted subject to the ap
proval of the American Senate. All my
observations were futile. The President
was firm. Seeing he was at the point of
ending the interview and breaking off the
peace negotiation I begged him to tell me
what security he could offer Spain as to
his sincerity. He replied:
"There is only one way to conclude this
series of errors and delays, and that is to
draft a protocol which should Include the
conditions demanded by the United States
and to which Spain must agree, if she be
sincere in her protestations of a desire
for peace. 1 would suggest that minor
commissions be created to confer as to the
evacuation of Cuba and Porto Rico. You
communicate this proposition to Madrid
and ask authority to sign the protocol. If
you get the authority and actually do
sign the protocol I will at once order a
suspension of hostilities, but not other
wise."
He added that as the object of the com
mission at Paris was simply to draft a
treaty this could be proceeded with at
once and its ratification left to the Amer
ican Senate and the Cortes.
The protocol will be shown to me to
morrow. There is no doubt that the ter* ca
will be strict and rigorous, and I am per
suaded the President cannot be induced to
modiy the American pretensions. I tÂ«dl
you frankly that if Spain does not accept
the protocol promptly she need expect no
lenity from the victors. They are deter
mined upon the utter humiliation of Spain
and the success of their arms encourages
them to believe that they can obliterate
the kingdom. , CAMBON.
It will be a surprise to most Ameri
cans to learn that Spain began to seek
a peaceful settlement as early as July 8.
On that date the Spanish Minister of
Foreign Affairs sent the following dis
patch to Embassador Leon y Castillo
at Paris:
See Secretary of State for. France and
ask him to have the French Embassador
at Washington go to the President of the
United States and sound him gently on
terms upon which a suspension of hos
tilities might be agreed on.
You should act with haste in this mat
ter, but not with apparent haste or anx
iety, as such action might prejudice our
cause. You should be very discreet in
this undertaking, as the Americans are
tired of the war and would like to retire.
They must not be given the impression
that we are discouraged or that our re
sources are fast ebbing.
This is the reply that came back:
Have seen Secretary of State for France
and he personally agrees with the propo
sition on the ground that the war is a
distress to humanity, a burden to com
merce and has a marked tendency to keep
the popular mind in a state of excitement.
He cannot, however, at this time give me
a definite answer, as he must await the
return to Paris of the French President,
who ls absent and will not return until
several days have passed.
On July 25 the following dispatch
was received from the Spanish Embas
sador at Paris:
The Secretary of State informs me that
Embassador Cambon has presented his
instructions and that the American Presi
dent had full information concerning the
document. He welcomed the French Em
bassador and remarked that he was aware
of the mission on which he called and
was familiar with his instructions. This
the Embassador found to be quite true
upon close conversation with President
McKinley.
The formal letter of Embassador
Cambon to the Minister of Foreign Re
lations for Spain follows, dated Wash
ington, July 31, and addressed to his
Excellency, the Duke de Almodavar del
Rio, Minister of State, Spain:
The President states that it is the un
alterable conviction of the people of the
United States that only the end of Span
ish sovereignty in the West Indies can
put a stop to the war. For many years
the Government of the United States, re
specting the susceptibility of the kingdom
of Spain, has at great expense to its
treasury, enforced the acknowledgment
by its citizens, of Spanish sovereignty in
Cuba and accepted the obligations im
posed by neutrality. But at . last came
a moment when It was impossible to
maintain this attitude. The spectacle
kept- before-American* eyes of fertile ter
ritory seared by fire and depopulated by
starvation could' no longer be endured.
Listening to the pleadings of humanity
America lifted up its strong arm in de
fense of a down-trodden people and to
suppress at any cost to herself a condi
tion which gave Americans pain. - _*
For these reasons the President of the
United States, acting on the advice of
his Cabinet and of Congress, resolved to
command of Spain that she remove her
raval and military forces from the island
of Cuba and that she give to the Inhabi
tants of that island their liberty and their
political independence.
To this end Spain answered by severing
diplomatic relations with the United
States and declaring that she interpreted
this act on the part of the American Gov
ernment as amounting virtually to a
declaration that a state of war existed
between the two Governments.
The President of the United States
regrets that the question of Cuba's rights
had to be settled with the sword and by
conflict between two great nations*, but
having accepted this eventuality with all
its risks and prosecuting the war on land
and sea as his duty told him. he sought
by these methods to obtain the quickest
and most honorable peace. In doing this
he has spared no expense either of blood
or of money. , 'â¢ ;
The President of the United States is
pleased to offer to his valorous adversary
generous peace conditions. He will form
ulate a peace proposition which will have
to meet with the approval of the Senate
of the United States before peace may be
finally concluded. The President under
stands that Spain desires to protect Cuba
from danger of premature indebtedness,
and the Government of the United States
is not combating the position of Spain on
this point, but believes that in the pres
ent state of perturbation on the island
Cuba needs the advice and help which the
Government of .the United States is dis
posed to give to her.
The Minister of Foreign Relations
cabled the following reply to Embas
sador Cambon direct on August 1:
Snain would incline to the belief that
upon Cuba should tall the burden of the
payment of any Indemnity to the United
States. Soain is indifferent as to the
character of the indemnity or to the terms
of payment. A . , '
You must find out one important thing
which this Government wants to know,
namely, if the demand of the United
States for the cession of Porto Rico can
not be postponed till some other proposi
tion may be arrived at or some other kind

Clear, Ringing Words of Victory From the
Republican Standard-Bearers at the
Close of the Campaignâ Davie's
Scathing Arraignment.
OAKLAND, March 11.â Inde- !
pendent-Democratic ' candidates
on the municipal ticket held
their grand rally at the Taber
nacle to-night. C. W. Wilkins,
chairman of the City Central .Commit
tee of the Independent party, presided,
and introduced ex-Sheriff McKilllcan,
who spoke on behalf of Captain Ed
Hackett, the Independent-Democratic
candidate for Auditor. The speaker
advocated a careful scrutiny of all the
names on the ticket and the election of
the best, among whom he said Captain
Hackett, the old-time Democrat, stood
at the head.
J. H. Creegan, a candidate for Coun
cilman-at-Large, deplored the propo
sition that Oakland is not as progres
sive as it was thirteen years ago, and
declared that only by electing business
men to the Council can such conditions
be improved.
Robert Graham, a nominee for Coun
cilman-at-Large, said he had cam

paigned for fifteen days and had not
been scored by the newspapers, and
might consider himself lucky. He de
voted himself for several minutes to
roasting newspaper men who did not
report the Independent party candi
dates correctly.
- F. A. Campbell made a short speech
in which he stated that a man who had
been nominated by a convention of 150
Republicans need not apologize
for being a candidate. He said
Oakland is not what it should
be, and there is no reason why
It should be so dull, with its many ad
vantages, and he attributed it to the
narrow-mindedness of the city govern
ments that have prevailed for the past
few years.
John L. Davie was received with
cheers as he was introduced as "the
next Mayor of Oakland." Mr. Davie
said he expected that this campaign
would be one of vituperation, especially
from certain newspapers, and he had
not been deceived. "I asked for no
nominations at the 'hands of any
party," said the speaker, "but they
were forced upon me. The Independent
Republican Convention was composed
of 150 gentlemen and I have no apology
to make for accepting their nomination.
â¢'The Democratic Convention was
composed of the very best of the Oak
land Democracy. Seth Mann, chairman
of the Democratic State Central Com
mittee, was an active spirit in the con
vention and so was Henry C. McPike,
and surely Warren B. English, the man
who four years ago represented seven
counties in the Congress of the United
States, is a good Democrat.
"The Democratic campaign was
opened by that grand old Democrat,
Hon. W. W. Foote. who has the re
spect of the whole State, and yet I
read in the Examiner that I am the
tool of a convention bossed by Bros
nahan and Moffitt. That same paper
says in to-day's issue that not a sin
i gie candidate has denied being owned
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
by Brosnahan and Moffltt since the
campaign opened. That is false.
"I have denied it in every platform
that I have spoken from and I again
deny it. Mr. Pardee and Mr. Dalton
denounce me, and between them and
the Examiner you would think Davie
was not the man who was Mayor of this
city for two years and who reduced
your ferry fares and ran your govern
ment cheaper than it was ever run, be
fore or since.
"Yet with all their abuse, if you will
notice, no one has dared to say that
Davie was ever dishonest.
"They have hurled calumnies at
me, and the Democratic organ will no
doubt come out to-morrow morning
with a fresh tirade of abuse. In fact,
that sheet will give you almost any
thing you want but the news. Al
though this Democratic campaign
was inaugurated and carried on by
the very best Democracy of this city,
the Examiner has acted in such an
untruthful manner that its - own
patrons have become disgusted with
it and are dropping it by hundreds,
and when a paper's subscribers drop
it, there is something wrong.
"To-day I discovered that the many
good things said by the Examiner of
Mr. Snow were paid for by him. One
of my friends received a most pecu
liar letter. It asked him to permit the
Examiner to be left at his house, and
guaranteed that if he did not want
the sheet Mr. Snow, the Republican
nominee, would pay for it. I am not
a Republican, but I have some idea
of what the Republicans must think
of their nominee for Mayor, who will
actually pay for the Democratic organ
to be left in their doorway for a
month.
"I have noticed during this campaign
that the Republican press of San Fran
cisco has been so completely tied up to
its party ticket that I could get none
of my speeches reported. This shows
why Republicans can generally get
their way â they have money. Ido not
know whether Mr. Snow respects the
spirit of the purity of the election law,
but I do not think such campaigning
would be acceptable to the Republican
party of Oakland any more than to the
Democratic party.
"Gentlemen, did you ever hear of
anything like this before *- Demo
cratic paper openly asking money
from : a Republican candidate for
Mayor for the purpose of defeating
the Democratic ticket? And what does
it mean P It simply means that the
people of this city are so disgusted
with the political hypocrisy of such
a paper that they will not have it,
unless some one else pays for it, and
so to keep up the appearance of hav
ing a circulation it holds a club over
the Republican candidate for Mayor2
and uses him to bolster up their dy
ing cause.
"Now I will let you into the secret
of the Examiner's hostility toward me.
Many years ago I started the scheme
to defeat Mr. Huntington's railroad
funding bill. At that time and for
some time after the Examiner was re
ceiving JIOOO per month "from "the pay
roll of the Southern Pacific. Mr. Bas
set! was in Washington for eight
months doing the real work that de
feated the bill and I was paying his
expenses.
"Then what do you think? Why,
when the funding bill was first defeated
the Examiner took all the credit of it
and sent for me and asked me if I
would go to San Francisco and stand
on a platform in front of the Examiner
office and give that newspaper all the
credit. I said that the Mayor of Oak
land would not be a puppet to any
such Examiner fake, and from that
hour that paper has maligned me and
has done everything it possibly could
to Injure me in every way. But do the
people approve of such work? Judg
ing by the letter I have just read to
you I do not think so, nor does the
Examiner think so. I tell you that
paper could not be true to anybody
and is not true to itself.
"I want to tell you that when I was
attending to business no one could walk
into the city Hall and steal $600 on a
warrant belonging to Messrs. Crane or
any one else. Nor will they do it if I
am Mayor again."
A carman named Fortln-was intro
duced and told of the carmen's pref
erence for T. F. Garrity, because W. A.
Dow had secured the suspension of a
conductor with whom he had a misun
derstanding in a ear some months ago.
T. F. Garrity renewed his pledge that
if elected City Attorney he would at-
nd to the water front cases and would
fc-ec that no special attorneys were em
ployed in the future. R. M. Clement,
candidate for City Engineer, was the
f:na! speaker.
Mr. Snow, after the meeting, was told
of the remarks of Mr. Davie, and said,
in explanation: "Yes, I see that they
have brought hat out against me," re
ferring to the letter rend by John L.
Davie at the Independents' meeting.
"Well, if they can make any.capital.out
of it they are welcome. 1 do not deny
that I wrote the letters. There were
eighty-five of those letters, all written
to members of the Municipal League.
"The truth is this. . Davie .recently
went to a certain saloon and asked
each one who came in whether he sub
scribed for the Examiner. If they an
swered affirmatively, why he simply re
quested them to teleghone to the Ex
aminer office to stop the paper. This
was hurting the man who has charge
of the Examiner in this city, and it was
only to help him out that I wrote to
those eighty-five members of the Mu
nicipal League advising them that I
had ordered the paper sent to their
homes, and that I had paid for the
subscription. The paper had stood by
the Municipal League without being
paid a cent and surely I could well af
ford to pay the eighty-five subscrip
tions."
REPUBLICANS CONFIDENT.
Enthusiastic Closing Meeting
of the Hosts at Hsmil-
ton Hall.
THE last day of the Republican city
campaign of Oakland closed last
evening with a rousing enthusias-
tic meeting in Hamilton Hall.
There were cheers and loud applause
for each candidate as he appeared tin
the platform, that betoken a sweeping
victory to the Republican municipal
ticket next Monday. There was no at
tempt at a parade," but at an early
hour the crowd moved toward the. hall
at the corner* of Clay and Thirteenth 1
streets, led by the uniformed Young
Men's Republican dub, President A.
H. Breed, the candidate for Auditor
and Assessor.
The meeting was called to order by
Chairman George S. Meredith of the
Republican City Central Committee.
Mr. Meredith consumed no time in -his
introduction of the speaking candi
dates. He said the work had been
finished, the fight had been won and
the ticket and the voters were simply
here to look at each other.
W. A. Dow. candidate for City At
torney, introduced amid loud cheers
which indicate his election, sprang
quickly Into his theme. He said the
candidates in their rounds had found
the people of Oakland realizing that
this was a fight between decency and
indecency. Not a nominee on the Re
publican ticket is the creature of a
boss, not nominated by a boss, but is
the candidate of the people.
â¢ This is not the ticket of the solid six.
He referred to R. W. Snow, the candi
date for Mayor, and spoke of his long
and able occupancy of the office of Au
ditor and Assessor. Mr. Snow could
have remained in that office for life,
but the people of Oakland called him
to be their Mayor and he had responded
to the call and next Monday the citizens
would approve of his response by elect
ing him. He asked them to elect the
present Superintendent of Streets, M.-
K. Miller, to the office, of City Engineer,
and with Snow and Miller on the Board
of Public Works there would be har
mony and an able administration of
their duties.
B. C. Cuvellier, candidate for Council
man, spoke of an effort being made to
defeat him by a certain improvement
club been of his refusal to. consent
to the expenditure of $80,000 for the
dredging of Lake Merritt when the city
v.-as suffering under a grievous deficit.
The lake should be dredged but the sad
state of the city finances should be first
considered. With those who were try
ing to knife him on the eve of election
by the distribution of lying circulars he
would have war until sundown on elec
tion day and then he would bury the
hatchet.
The last speaker was the nominee for
Mayor, R. W. Snow, who spoke in part
as follows:
In an extended interview with myself,
published in ISSG in the Oakland Enquirer,
the following question was asked concern- I
ing public improvements: "How do you
account for it, Mr. Snow, that although I
Oakland has always talked about public
parks she has never bought one, and that
other municipal Improvements, although i
they seem to be so much desired, are so
slow in coming?"
The answer was as follows: "For the
same reason that we do not buy a park !
now. There seems to be no wise judgment â 
as to the necessity, size, location and best
means of acquiring. That is to say, no
Judgment which citizens are ready to ac
cept without question. If a Common
Council was to be elected upon this sole
issue, unless they moved quickly they
would probably be enjoined before a park
Bite could be secured. Advancing prices
push Oakland's park further into the foot
hills every year. It would seem that a
Council and Mayor must arise who will
wisely select a park site or sites and
somehow lead the voters and taxpayers of
this city to its acceptance."
Meantime the progress of cities near us
makes our own progress imperative. San
Francisco was a sand dune when Oakland
was known to be the finest residence city
In California. Now San Francisco stands
welL to the front as, a residence city, and
its powerful Merchants' Association de
clares its intention to bond that city to
bring its beautiful park down Into the
heart of the city, to build boulevards,
museums and art galleries: to make it one
of the finest residence cities in the world.
For the business Interests of Oakland
San Francisco had better be five hundred
miles away than Just across the bay.
Os Angeles and Portland have out
stripped us in the race because they are
wholesale points, having a large number
of towns in their vicinity. We have no
quarrel with the city- of San Francisco.
The sun will some day rise upon a city
on this side of the b^iss r a C 1 n an from
Po'nt Richmond to S row yearly with the
Kwttoe w^BhSuW grow yearly with the
I growth of San Francisco and the increase
, of population on the Pacific Coast.
But we are -especially concerned with
the problem of the hour. We have seen
i in the last ten years the gradual decline
! in the value of our residence property in
this city. Even the Assessor has discov
ered that the property in many parts or
j the city has a cash value much less than
I ten years ago. , "vÂ»aU^l/1

No man can be elected in this city who
is not in favor of continuing the prosecu

' shall know the city's rights. If the con

by the Legislature of this State we shall
I soon know it. and 1 suppose we shall have

! priate a large sum for the further lm
' vi meat of our harbor and water front
it may be profitable to do so. If the har
bor bill does not pass, then our charter
provides for a complete plan of water
front improvements. These plans should
be found ready a* soon as our property
rights are determined:
I find that I am speaking: to you as
' though I were already your Mayor. If the
candidate on the Democratic, etc., ticket
had any foundation for his assertions that
this city could be run in a manner satis

! almost mean suggestions of economy I
i have it in mind to make.
THE OAKLAND OUTLOOK.
How the ' Political Situation
Locks From an Unbiased
Standpoint.
To-morroW Oakland will vote for a new
city government. For over a year the
whole State has been amused periodically
by the peculiar manner in which Oakland
governsâ misgovernsâ herself. To the
outsider Oakland does not appear to an
advantage when viewed by the manner in
which her government conducts itself.
Naturally, the greatest interest centers
around the Board of Public Works, which
consists of the three Commissioners who
have the power any minute they may
desire and as often as they please to
entirely change the personnel of the
Street, Police and Fire departments. Mr.
Snow, the Republican nominee, and Mr.
Davie, the Independent-Democratic can
didate, are the only two names attracting
any attention for Mayor. Each man has
a record on which he can make a cam
paign. Snow has been City Auditor for
ten years, and has always merited the re
spect of those who elected him. Davie
was Mayor for two years, and during that
time started an opposition ferry which
had the result ever since of reducing ferry
fares, and this has been the basis of Mr.
Davie's campaign. Another point of dif
ference about which much has been said
Is the tax levy. Auditor Snow believing
that it should be $1, without the 17 cents
required for bond interest and redemption,
and Mr. Davie declaring that the total
tax levy under the charter cannot legally
exceed $1.
The Prohibitionists have nominated Dr.
Buckland for Mayor. The doctor once
served as a Councilman .with marked
credit to himself. The Populists have
nominated Mr. Hoenich, and the Socialist
Labor party also has a candidate. But
there will be no appreciable votes cast
outside of Snow and Davie.
The contest for the City Attorneyship is
absolutely between two men, there 'being
not a single side-show candidate. Mr.
Dow Is the choice of the Republicans and
Municipal League, and Mr. Garrity of the
Independents and Democrats. Mr. Dow
has been a city official for six years, and
Mrâ ,Garxlty- has .alVay^Jbeer* a persistent
Democratic candidate, and although on
one occasion he carried the city of Oak
land in a. county tight he has not yet been
elected to office. City Engineer Clement,
the Democratic nominee to succeed him
self, is opposed by M. K. Miller, the Su
perintendent of Streets. Both men are
competent engineers. Mr. Clement has
given general satisfaction in his office,
and Mr. Miller has been frequently com
mended for the able work of his depart
ment. Both are comparatively young men
and as there are no other candidates who
will figure in the returns the issue be
tween them Is largely a personal one.
Z. T. Gilpin, who has been City Treas
urer for eight years, by the grace of
Oakland Republicans, is up for another
term; his opponent is J. E. Salpaugh, a
Populist, who obtained some notoriety
while a Southern Pacific engineer, about
five years ago,. by refusing to take out his
engine during the strike.
An interesting three-cornered fight is in
progress for City Auditor. Arthur H.
Breed, chairman of the County Republic
an Committee, is opposed by D. C. Hins
dale and Captain Ed Hackett. Mr. Hins
dale is the choice of the Municipal
League and Mr. Hackett of the Demo
crats and Independent Republicans. This
is one of the few places on the ticket
upon the filling of which the Republicans
and the Municipal League did not agree.-
Over the selection of the City Council
there are as many interests at work as
candidates. In each ward there are three
or four candidates for one office, while for
the four candidates at large there are ex
actly a quarter of a hundred names on the
ballot.
There are also many names from
which to choose eleven School Directors
and Library Trustees. But there is never
much of. a scramble over these offices, for
there is no salary attache-* to them, and
the positions are solely t>ose of honor.
It is not easy to arrive at any probable
result of Monday's election by looking
over the figures of the past. John L. Da
vie fluctuates considerably as a political
candidate, but he always runs with con
siderable strength. Four years ago, when
Populism was at its height and the anti
railroad feeling was at fever heat. Davie
ran for Mayor with the single Populist
indorsement. J. W. Nelson, a leading
business man of Oakland, was nominated
by the Republicans and indorsed by the
Municipal League and Democratic con
ventions. Under ordinary circumstances
Nelson's votes should have been 8000 and
Davie's 2000. But when the returns were
in Davie was elected. /
Two years ago Davie ran again. On
this occasion he was opposed by W. R.
Thomas. Republican; Seth Mann, Dem
ocrat; A. C. Henry, Independent, and
Rev. S. Goodenough. Populist. The vote
stood approximately; Thomas, 3040: Da
vie. 2970; Seth Mann, 2300; A. C. Henry,
450 and Goodenough 800. This year all
these votes have to be divided between
Davie and Snow, and in addition there are
1500 new votes from the annexed districts,
the political complexion of which is a
matter of guesswork. â *
Snow has always carried the solid Re
publican vote of Oakland. Whenever, he
was nominated for Auditor it has always
been conceded that he would carry the
full Republican majority with him, and
he has always done so. It is to this abil
ity of Snow's to carry his party that he
depends for his election.
More than ever attention is being di
rected to the "silent vote." In Oakland,
out of its 12,000 voters, about 3000 talk.
The other 9000 think. The 3000 are always
around town and generally succeed in, cre
ating among those not versed in Oakland
politics an impression that everything is
going their way, and that the other fel
lows have not a ghost of a show.
Oakland has another element among her
voters not found ln most cities. It is the
commuter.. There are probably 1000 peo
ple traveling dally between Oakland and
San Francisco who vote across the bay.
These people meet nearly every day of
their lives, and the natural result is that
they consider themselves a sort of fra
ternal society. .They discuss their poli
tics together, and as a rule vote pretty
much the same way. On the Republican
ticket this time there are six candidates
for the Council who are commuters, and
of these most of them will probaly get
the solid vote of their daily fellow-trav
elers.
Some individual more enthusiastic that
judicious has circulated a handbill stating
that the Christian Endeavorers are tak
ing a hand in the election of certain can
didates. . E. C. Lyons, president of the
Alameda County Christian Endeavor
.Union, said to-night that any such state
ment is absolutely false, and that the
Endeavorers are taking no hand what
ever except as Individual citizens In the
1 camnalem.
THE SAX AX CISCO CALL, SVyPAY. " MABCH 12, 1899.
JOHNSON'S BILL
WAS PREPARED BY
MURDOCK ATTORNEYS
Grove Will Be in tne Case in a "Certain
Contingency." \ â¢
WAS FULLY AWARE OF ITS PURPOSE
Members of the Legal Profession Denounce â¢ the. Conduct of
the Assemblyman as Being v Flagrant
. Breach of His Privilege. ;
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 11.â The discovery
made yesterday that Assembly bill No.
90S, introduced by Assemblyman Grove
L. Johnson' and which provides for an
amendment to that section of the Code
of Civil Procedure relating to the com
petency of certain witnesses, was
framed apparently for the purpose of
MEXICAN DAN: "THEY CERTAINLY WERE NOT GOOD TO ME."
affecting the status of certain lawsuits
in which Mr. Johnson is interested, or
expects to be interested as an attorney,
has caused a great amount of comment
here to-day. In the termination of two
of the suits referred to as being Im
mediately affected by the passage of
the bill Introduced by Mr. Johnson
more than a half-million dollars is in
volved.
The proposed law has a direct bear
ing on the case of Amanda Austin vs.
George Wilcoxson, executor of the es
tate of Jefferson Wilcoxson, deceased,
in which Johnson is attorney for plaint
iff. The suit is for the recovery of
$150,000 alleged to be due for services
rendered the deceased as nurse and
housekeeper.
The second suit, and the one that is
more particularly affected by the pro
posed law, is that of Mary Helen Mur
dock vs. the estate of William Murdock,
deceased. This suit is for the recovery
of the principal and interest on a* note
alleged to have been given plaintiff by
Murdock at some time prior to his
death. The note with accrued interest
amounts to about $380,000. In this case
Johnson does not appear as an attorney
of record. His exact connection with
the case is somewhat clouded, as will be
seen from the following statement made
to-day by Frank Freeman, attorney for
plaintiff: y-:, x_ ;
i "Mr. Johnson is not an attorney of
record for the plaintiff in the Murdock
case. He is only associate counsel. It
was at my request that he introduced
Assembly bill No. 908. There is nothing
wrong about it, and if there is I. will
take the blame of it. Defendant's at
torneys have taken the deposition of
the plaintiff, but under the present law
we are not allowed to examine her as
to facts concerning relations or con-
tracts entered into or existing between
herself and the deceased -prior to the
latter's death. We simply seek to have
the law so amended as to. enable us to
do this. Mr. Johnson is not an attorney
for the plaintiff. I don't know whether
he will be one or not. ' That all de
pends on circumstances."
"Does his employment as counsel for
plaintiff depend upon his success in get
ting the bill passed?" was asked.
"No; that Is not a condition."
From this It would appear that Mr.
Johnson is and is not acting in the
capacity of attorney for the person who
is to be benefited by the passage of the
proposed law. That the bill was intro
duced and its passage is sought by Mr.
Johnson is admitted. That it was in
troduced for the purpose of benefiting
the plaintiff in the Murdock case is also
admitted. It is. also evident that Mr.
Johnson is fully aware of the purpose
of the bill.
It seems that Mr. Johnson is tak
ing advantage of his position as
member of the Legislature to use the
power of that body to assist him in
winning a lawsuit in which he is,
or may be, or hopes to be, interested
as an attorney. The defendant's at
torneys having proceeded under ths
law, and within its limitations, by
taking the deposition of the plaintiff
to the action, Mr. Johnson now seeks
to change tbe law so that what haÂ»
been done by opposing counsel will
work to their disadvantage.
' Now that the scheme has been ex
posed, there is no danger that the bill
will ever pass out of the hands of the
Judiciary Committee of the Senate,
where it now is, for the reason that the
committee is made up of gentlemen
learned in the law and fully aware of
the viciousness of the proposed mea
sure. To allow a live" person to testify
against one who is dead, and therefore
not able to refute false charges, i_
something that never has been, is not
now and never will be permitted by
the laws of this country. There seems
to be here occasion for the shedding of
more tears by Mr. Johnson.
â *
A FLAGRANT BREACH
OF HIS PRIVILEGE
The cunning scheme of Assemblyman !
Grove L. Johnson to smuggle through >
an amendment to section 1880 of the ;
Code of Civil Procedure, for the al
leged purpose of enabling him to gain
decisions in certain cases now pending,
involving hundreds of thousands of
dollars, wherein he appears as attorney
for the litigants," is looked upon by
members of the legal profession in this
city as a -flagrant breach of privilege
on the part of a legislator and ex
tremely reprehensible. It is generally,
believed that the exposure of the
scheme by the publication of the facts
in the case in The Call yesterday morn
ing will result in the defeat of the pro
posed amendment in the Senate. Never
theless, the fact that a member of the
Legislature should use his position to '
further his personal end*-, or those of
his clients, at the expense of other liti
gants not so fortunate or unfortunate
as to have a member of the Legisla
ture for an attorney, is regarded as a
matter requiring a thorough investiga
tion, for although Johnson may succeed
in squirming out of the predicament in
which he finds himself, and while there '
may be no law to punish legislators
who are found guilty of such practices,
the publicity of an investigation by a
legislative committee would have a
wholesome effect and put the people on
their guard.
Johnson will of course deny that the
proposed amendment was intended to
benefit his clients specifically, but to
show how utterly absurd any such de
nial would be it is only necessary to
quote a few facts. For instance, as
stated in The Call yesterday morning,
Johnson is one of the attorneys for the
plaintiffs in the now celebrated case of
Mary Helen Murdock et al. against the
estate of the late William Murdock,
wherein it 'is sought to recover princi
pal and Interest on a note for $100.
--000, dated in 1577, and bearing interest
at the rate of 1 per cent a 'month, the
entire amount sued for now' amounting
to half a million dollars. As the law
stands, section 3 provides that "parties
or assignors of parties to an action or
proceeding, or persons in whose behalf
an action or proceeding is prosecuted
against an executor or administrator,
upon a claim or demand against the es
tate of a deceased person, as to any
matter of fact occurring before the
death of such deceased person," are dis
qualified as witnesses in such action.
Mary Helen Murdock is a party to
the action for half a million dollars
against the estate of William Murdock,
and under the law she cannot testify to
any facts or matter occurring before the
death of the deceased. Some time ago
Attorney Lusk, acting for the adminis
trator of the estate, took Mary Helen's
deposition on a minor point or two hav
ing a small bearing on the present suit.
Here is where Johnson gets in his fine
work, for his amendment to the code j
which has been smuggled through the >
Assembly and is now pending in the |
Senate, is cleverly worded so as to
make Mary Helen eligible as a witness
in the pending litigation by reason of
her having made a deposition in the j
case. Referring to section 3 above
quoted the amendment says: "Pro- |
vided that such persons or parties be- j
come fully competent if required by
the executor or administrator to testify j
or be sworn in the action as to such !
matters, either on the trial or by depo- |
i sition."
In view of these facts, which John- j
! son cannot deny, it is hardly likely that ;
j any amount of explaining on his part
will, serve to convince any one capable i
I of putting two and two together that i
he is wholly disinterested In the amend
; ment to the code proposed by him. Not
I only will the amendment prove of great
I benefit to the plaintiffs in the suit I
! against the Murdock estate, should it ;
1 be enacted into law, but it will also let i
[down the bars for the introduction of:
j prohibited testimony in the case of \
! Amanda Austin vs. the estate of Jef- ;
i ferson Wilcoxson, deceased, wherein j
I plaintiff seeks to recover $150,000 al- ;
\ leged to be due for services as nurse j
; and housekeeper for a period of eight- j
â  een years: about $700 a month. John- i
; son is attorney for the plaintiff in this*
action as in the Murdock cast .
SENATE ROUTINE OF
CONFIRMATIONS AND BILLS
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 11.â By a message to the
Senate the Governor announced this
morning that he had appointed Mrs.
Phebe Hearst a regent of the State "Uni
versity to succeed J. West Martin, and
Dr. George C. Pardee of Oakland to suc
ceed James D. Phelan. Mrs. Hearst, Phe
lan and Martin were among those
whose names were withdrawn from the
consideration of the Senate some weeks
ago.
The message was called up at once, and j
the Governor's appointments were con
firmed. The appointments are both for
unexpired terms.
The Governor also announced his ap
proval of Senate bill 105. an act relating
to Justice Courts and Justices of the
Peace.
Senate bill 450, one of Burnett's meas
ures, slipped past the Senate with prac
tically no opposition. It is a bill almost
similar to Assemblyman Muenter's bill,
which was refused passage by the Senate
last Thursday. The measure provides
that banks shall make a statement to the
Assessor and a statement to the Bank
Commission the first Monday in March. ;
As it is now the statement to the Bank j
Commission is made in June, and it dif- i
fers widely from that made to the As- |
sessor in March. Burnett's bill was put
to a vote without argument, and there I
was a call of the Senate before a suffi
cient number of votes had been secured, i
The Senators did not recognize the
measure, and several who opposed Muen
ter's bill voted for Burnett's and then had
to change back to "no." It made but lit
tle difference to the opponents of the
measure, however, for it must be passed
by the Assembly, and there is not much I
chance of it coming upon the House file.
The vote on the passage of the bill wasâ ;
Ayes 22, noes 9.
Assemblyman Cargill's bill appropriat
ing $160 to pay the claim of W. C. Guirey j
for war bounty money, a claim which
dates from the Civil War, was denied a
second reading on motion of Dickinson. i
Dickinson explained that there was a re
ceipt for the money now in the hands of
the Controller, and therefore he thought
the only thing the Senate could do would |
be to kill the bill. His motion was car
ried. It appears from the record that
Guirev had signed the receipt through a
representative, but Guirey declared this
was a false entry. Dickinson said the
Finance Committee, to which the bill had
been referred, had no time nor was it
within the committee's powers to inves
tigate the alleged forged receipt, and so
there was no way of paying the claim
until the courts had passed on the mat
ter, if it could be brought before them.
The claim has been hanging for over
thirty years. - -y-: â *â¢ - '_}â _
This evening the Senate intended to pet
to work, but that was as close to a ses
sion as the Senators got. When S o'clock j
arrived there were but eight or ten Sen- j
ators in the chamber, and after the ser
geants-at-arms had looked over the Cap- .
itol they could brine in but two or three
more, it was therefore decided to let the j
Senate rest until Monday morning at 10 i
o'clock.
ADJOURNMENT TO BE
TAKEN NEXT SATURDAY
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 11.â It is not likely that
this session of the Legislature will extend
over next Saturday evening, the ISth.
To-day Belshaw's concurrent resolution
to adjourn sine die to-night was recalled
from the table and amended to read "Sat
urday, the ISth inst.," and as amended the
Assembly adopted it.
' The Senate has already agreed upon
the same date, and if the general appro
priation bill and tax levy can be got
through with this coming week will see
the end of things here at the Capitol.
The county government act is no longer
a consideration. So far as this Legislat
ure is concerned it is dead. Members of
the Assembly whose counties are in need
of certain legislation are already getting
new bills up to introduce independently
of the omnibus measure. When adjourn
ment is mentioned the appropriation bill
and tax levy are the only considerations
that enter into ensuing argument.
And now the Senate says, unofficially,
that it won't agree to adjourn sine die on
Saturday next. It can't get through work
by that time, and besides it does not just
relish the idea that the Assembly makes
the proposition. The resoluton to adjourn
has been a time-honored prerogative of
the upper house, and silk-hatted and be
camelliaed dignity won't stand for its
usurpation.
Last week matters were different: the
members of the Republican majority
talked it over informally and agreed that
the ISth should be the day, but now they
are holding out for another week and are
holding up as an excuse the general ap
propriation bill, tax levy and even the
county government act, despite the fact
that the incongruous mess Is considered
as dead as a mackerel.
The Assembly is ready to quit as soon
as a reasonable excuse can be found for
doing so. That is. a certain portion of
the Assembly is. With a good many of
them there the problem of subsistence has
become a serious one. :-â 
"The push" blew in its shekels, all it
had and all it had coming, when the ses
sion was yet young, and even $56 per does
not go very far here in Sacramento. They
are buying their drinks and putting their
lunches on tags just now, and when their
stand up with the man -behind the bar
expires it will be a case of a pass home
whether a Senator has been elected or
not. No matter what the feeling in the
Senate, it is considered that adjournment
will take place on Saturday, the gang can
not be kept from breaking after that day,
and unless some unforeseen circumstance
arises the upper house will .probably fall
in line. â â

1 this city oh Wednesday. Much to the
: distress of Drury Melone the repre
-1 sentative of the Placerville folks forced
j a compromise proposition by which
i they agree to pay the sum of $3400, the
' original face of the bonds and 6 per
cent interest for a period of about two
I years back. The men who forced the
negotiations for Placerville are Attor
ney Charles Swisler, Judge Williams
i and ex-Assemblyman George Burnham.
By the agreement to which they
came Melone and Dibble were to either
â . withdraw the bill or back amendments
: which would render it inoperative, and
< to-night the opportunity offered to get
action on it. Assemblyman Raw of El
' Dorado, who has directed the fight
against the measure, had a blank space
: on the file that was next in considera-
t ion. He turned it over to Dibble, who
'. moved -to give the space to the Placer
ville bill. Valentine seconded him and
it was so ordered, despite a fight put
up by the San Francisco delegation.
Then Valentine offered his amend
ments, which kill the bill, and the vote
was on them when the San Francisco
delegation, mistaking the intent of Dib
ble's objecting to a ruling by Anderson,
I walked out and forced an adjournment.
i The amendments will be adopted on
! Monday after there has been an oppor
: tunity to explain matters to the San
I Franciscans.

DISINTEGRATION
IN BURNS' RANKS
Touts Are Downhearted and Dispirited Over the
Outlook.
LINDLEY IS NOW WORKING A NEW FAKE
Professes to Be Hand in Glove With the Grant People, bat
His Raw Scheming Fails to Delude Even the
Most Gullible,
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 11.â Daniel M. Burns
has not gained a single vote since poor
old Simpson of Pasadena rolled into
his camp. The touts are downhearted
and dispirited, but some of them boast
that the "colonel" has sufficient power
to prevent the election of a Senator.
Burns, finding that he cannot rule, is
casting about to see how he can in
flict the greatest injury on the common
wealth. Dibble still expresses the
opinion that Burns will be able to rally
a sufficient number of legislators next
week to win out, but the fact that Dib
ble expresses that opinion is no assur
ance that he holds It. Not long since
he asserted with an air of solemn sin
cerity that all of the Bulla men save
one tvould go to Burns. When Mr.
Bulla retired from the contest ten of his
followers went to General Barnes and
none to Colonel Burns.
Colonel J. P. Jackson, Collector of the
Port of San Francisco, arrived yes
terday. He put in his time to
day talking over the Senatorial situ
ation with candidates and members of
the Legislature. To-night he expressed
the belief that a Senator would be
elected next week. He is convinced
that Burns cannot win. When Colonel
Jackson was here two weeks ago he
found the forces lined up with adaman
tine solidity. In no camp was there a
single sign or indication of yielding in
order to secure the election of a Sena
tor. Now he finds that the members of
the Legislature are willing to listen to
talk on the line of concession and
agreement in order to bring about a
choice fur Senator.
"There will be no party caucus," said
Colonel Jackson, "as the caucus propo
sition is no longer feasible. Opposition
to the caucus has crystallized. , The
election will be accomplished by a se
ries of changes expressive of the dis
position on the part of the members to
unite on an able and acceptable can
didate. You will see a disintegration
of the forces. Members will change
from one candidate to another. These
changes will be from the Burns forces
as well as from those of Grant and
others. Many members are now dis
posed to change, but do not like to do
so individually for fear their motives
will be misconstrued. The concert of
action that I speak of will prevent such
impressions from gaining ground."
The managers of Burns' hopeless
struggle are doing everything possible
to create a feeling of bitterness between
the camps of General Barnes and Irv
ing M. Scott. In order to prevent a
union of these two camps, which would
place General Barnes on an equal foot
ing with the leaders, the Burns men
are asserting that not to exceed a half
dozen of Barnes' twenty-two votes
would be cast for him if his election
were imminent. The managers of the
Burns fight are not able to comprehend
how men can be held together without
boodle or expectation of official favor.
They are not conscious of the great
truth that men bound together by prin
ciple stand firm and steadfast to the
end. The supporters of Barnes are
alert, enthusiastic and loyal. They are
not boasting but are working with the
greatest confidence in their ability to
win out. They have made many friends
for their candidate in every Senatorial
camp.
The followers of Burns are endeavor
ing to create the belief that Hervey
Lindley, the "Colonel's" chief political
manipulator and confidential adviser,
enjoys the confidence and respect of
Grant's political managers. Many of the

i elements that build new, healthy flesh. It
is the great blood-maker and flesh-builder.
It cures 98 per cent, of all cases of con-
sumption and is the best of all known
remedies for nervous troubles. Thousands
have told, over their own signatures, the
stories of the wonders it has performed.
Honest dealers will not urge a substitute
for the sake of a little extra profit.
Thomas Fletcher, of Clifton Station. Fairfax
Co., Va., writes: "I suffered terrible torture.
for ten years with gastralgia' (pain in the

Golden Medical Discovery, which completely
cured me."
When the bowels are regular the body

Dr Pierces Pleasant Pellets cure con-

laxative, and two a mild cathartic. They
never gripe. All good dealers sell them ,
and have nothing else "just as good." I
touts who are not on the inside be
lieve to-night that a perfect under
standing exists between Burns and
Grant and that the San Diego states
man will clear the held for the "Colonel"
some time next week. There ls not a
curve nor a crook ln Lindley's system
that is not known in Grant's political
tent. The reported "close interviews"
between Lindley and Grant's people' are
pure inventions rank fakes.
One hundred members of the Legisla
ture responded to the call of the roll on
the joint ballot for Senator to-day and
the number necessary for a choice was
fifty-one. The Republican legislators
opposed to the election of Burns have
the power to take the subject out of
the hands of the railroad and the "ma
chine" and bring about the election of
a Senator!
The resolution to adjourn sine die
passed the Assembly to-day and will
doubtless obtain concurrence in the
Senate. No great effort will be required
to hold together in Sacramento the
fifty-eight Republicans who have so
gallantly fought the battle of the peo
ple from the beginning of the session
until this time. There is not a sign of
weakening anywhere along the line of
the people's representatives, but the
spoilsmen and the railroad forces show
signs of weariness.
Irving M. Scott left the capital for
San Francisco to-day. but will return
early next week. General Barnes is
here to-night consulting with his
friends and supporters. Colonel Jack
son will remain here until Tuesday of
next week. The Collector of the Port
and D. M. Burns met to-day in the
'Golden Eagle hotel. In the brief inter
view which followed the meeting no en
thusiasm was displayed by either.
SAN FRANCISCO CROWD
GETS HOT AT DIBBLE
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 11.â San Francisco
delegation in the Assembly got mad to
night, and as Mr. Kenneally tritely put it
"blocked the wheels of legislation" to the
extent of forcing adjournment.
Speaker Anderson, assisted by "Rig
Bill" McDonald of Alameda, who was
temporarily in the chair, caused it all by
a decision unsatisfactory to the San Fran
cisco crowd.
Assemblymen Valentine and Raw were
engaged in the pleasant duty of killing off
that Placervllle cinch bill, and Dibble of
San Francisco, who introduced the meas
ure In the first place, was good-naturedly
assenting to the operation.
The San Francisco delegation, however,
thought that Dibble was simply working
a scheme to get the bill forced ahead on
the file, and as they had all lined up to
beat It out when it should, come up on
final passage, they began making a hot
fight against the amendments that were
being offered.
The motion was on the appointment ol
a committee of one to amend. It was
made by Valentine and seconded by Dib
ble. The ayes and noes were called, and
McDonald declared that the ayes had It.
After he had announced the vote, Law
i rence Hoey, who has been laying for a
I chance to help Placervllle out ever since
he learned, the bill was crooked, demand
ed a division. McDonald would not order
it on the ground that he had already an
nounced the vote, and Hoey appealed
from the decision of the chair. Speaker
Anderson, who was on the floor, raised to
the point of order that the announcement
of a vote is not a decision, but a state
ment of fact, and could not be appealed.
i McDonald took his cue, and the whole
i metropolitan delegation got up and
walked outâ mad.
Judge Clough got mad. too, and walked
out. He said the bill appropriating $7500
to furnish the Surveyor General's office
was a clean steal, and he would not vote
to give it a cent. He demanded that it be
not given the place on the file that Melick
asked for it. but McDonald ruled other
: wise. And the Judge waxed Bjcrv. He
pointed his pistol finger at McDonald
; three or four times, out lortumue.y .1
: missed fire and the Judge turned round
1 disgusted and stamped out of the cham
i ber. Altogether It was a pleasant and ele
vating evening. â¢*,'-_ .-.,_, .
The bill that is to appropriate JjOOO to

Assemblyman Mllice of Riverside did
not come out as successfully with his bill

of 21 to 37. Works of San Diego gave no
; tice that on the next legislative day he
would move to reconsider.
Most of the day was given over to find
ing a quorum to vote on the different
bills as they came up. The 2 o'clock San
Francisco train carried a crowd out of
town, and the 5 o'clock took more,, and
by the time this evening's session was

HESITANCY ABOUT
REPAYING MR. SPRECKELS
, CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 11.â Senate bill 552 came
up for consideration at the meeting of the
Senate Finance Committee this evening.
It is an act to appropriate the sum of
$25,000 for the reimbursement of Claus
Spreekels. The money was advanced to
the State by Mr. Spreekels last fall when
the people of the southern part of the
State were suffering from the effects of
the drought and were in need of financial
assistance. A commission was appointed ;
and sent to the suffering districts and the
report made by it was read by the com- j
mittee this evening. The report on the
expenditures of the money was not entire- |
ly satisfactory to some of the members, |
and the matter was laid aside for further \
investigation. It appears that only $13,003 i
of the money was expended and that the j
balance is at present in the fund at the |
State treasury. The committee was in !
favor of returning the unused portion to ,
Mr. Spreekels and to further consider the I
payment of the balance. The consensus
of opinion, however, is to reimburse Mr. j
Spreekels. as the members of the com- ;
mittee consider that the money was given |
at a time when it was most needed and j
the philanthropy of the act appears to be j
appreciated.
INDUCED TO
STEAL BY HIS
BOSOM FRIEND
Oscar Anderson Is
Brought Back.
Oscar Anderson, the thieving clerk of
Charles Nelson, the ship-owner, who ab
sconded with $800 belonging to his em
ployer was brought back from Santa
Rosa last evening by Detective Tom Gib
son. Anderson, who is only IS years of
age, keenly feels the disgrace that he
has brought upon himself. Amid tears he
declared that he was induced to get away
with his employer's money by Lorenzo
Peterson and" Edward, alias "Dutchy,"
Baker, his bosom friend. Both of them
are also under arrest. The latter is said
to be a brother of Henry Baker, the
prize fighter, though young "Dutchy" de
nies that he has a brother.
Anderson was given a check for $800 to
cash and .after- receiving the amount he
met Baker, who Induced him to accom
pany him to Sacramento. They spent.part
of the money in riotous living and as they
feared that the local police were on their
trail they went to Davisville. where they
remained for two days. Anderson had a
few hundred dollars left of the stolen
money, and as he became suspicious of
the actions of the Constable he suggest
ed to Baker that they skip out. ...
They visited several interior towns and
finally brought up in Santa Rosa, ..where
they were joined by Peterson and a young
man who is known as Alfred Smith. An
derson rented apartments in the best ho- J
tel and invited the trio to live with him.
He treated them with the generosity of a
millionaire, refusing to allow them to
even buy a cigar. To show that he was
a "good fellow" Anderson bought a road
house and placed Baker in charge.
After- "blowing" the deluded youth, of
every cent he possessed Baker and Peter
son stole his- overcoat and came to this
city. Anderson, who was traveling under
the name of Stanley, was arrested while
searching for his companions and inci
dentally his overcoat, and ' held pending
the arrival of an officer from this city.
i Baker and Peterson were found in a lodg- j
' ing-house on Ellis street and also arrest

formally charged at the City Prison with |

Special Dispatch to The Call.
*f + + + + + + + + > + 4444
PEKING, March 11.â The Ital
ian Minister here, Signer Mar
tini, addressed a note to the
Foreign Office last evening, mak
ing a request to take back the
Italian dispatch asking for a
concession and notifying the
Foreign Office to accept it as
a demand, adding that he was
willing to enter into friendly
negotiations as to the details,
but insisting upon an answer
within four days. This note
was couched in courteous terms,
but the Chinese regard it in the
nature of an ultimatum, to
which they will probably yield.
+ + â¢{ 4, + .+ +-+ +.+ ''+*.:+ +-+â¢â¦
NEW YORK, March 11.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: A determined though
unofficial effort is being made to secure
the exercise by the United States of its
good offices in behalf of China. The
iter has not yet been brought offi
cially to the attention of Secretary Hay,
but it is understood he is aware of the
wishes of certain interested persons
and the advantages from their point of
view which would accrue to this Gov
ernment in case such action was taken.
It is untrue that any appeal has been
made to this Government to make any
representations to foreign Governments
to prevent them from seizing Chinese
territory. What is desired is that this
Government shall through its Minister
in Peking inform the Empress Dowager
of the dangerous position China occu
pies, and having done this, to make a
public declaration that the commercial
interests of the United States make it
necessary that no further leases of Chi
nese coast territory be granted.
It is extremely improbable, however,
that this Government will consent to
take such action. I was told to-day
that Chinese Minister Wu Ting Fang
has never received any advices from
his Government regarding the Italian
demand, nor has he made any repre
sentations to this Government on that
subject under instructions from Peking.
The Minister has naturally endeavored
to secure information respecting the at
titude of the United States, and is much
pleased at the announcement that this
Government does not seek Chinese ter
ritory.
â  Minister Coneer has so far been .the
medium of- communication, with .the
Chinese Government, and, as the Her
ald has stated, he has been instructed
that this Government did not interfere
when other nations acquired Chinese
territory and would most certainly not
do so in the case of Italy.

COLLISION
IS DEFTLY
WARDED OFF
British Lion and Russian
Bear in Uncomfortably-
Close Quarters.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated PreM.
LONDON, March 11.â The British
lion and the Russian bear came to un
comfortably close quarters this week
over the Chinese imbroglio. The news
papers had already begun to talk of a
serious crisis and grave outlook, but
the diplomatic switchmen again suc
ceeded in warding off a collision on the
subject of the Northern : Railroad, a
conflict being averted by a Russian
backdown, according to the jingoes,
and by a compromise, according to
more impartial observers.
The real explanation of the affair ap
pears to be that Russia made a pro
test against the British Railroad con
tract, partly as a feeler and partly as a
warning. If the British Premier had
shown weakness, Russia would have
persisted; -but in any case Russia, by
her protest, elicited a ministerial state
ment in the House of Commons that
the conditions of the loan did not con
stitute foreign control. Thus Russia
obtained a Pledge that no such inter
pretation would be placed on the con
tract in the event of default, which is
a further substantial concession to the
Russian claims in Northern China. On
the other hand. Lord Salisbury scored
in securing a withdrawal of the Hus
sion protest. But Russia also gained a
point with which she has good reason
to feel satisfied.
The Times thinks Lord Salisbury
achieved a considerable success which
must unquestionably strengthen Great
Britain's position at Peking. The pa
per, however, also sees in the adjust
ment of the dispute a triumph for the
pacific and conciliatory elements of
Russian statesmanship and, above all,
a practical expression of the Czar's de
termination to meet Great Britain half
way in the removal of all the regret
table misunderstandings which have
hitherto kept Great Britain and Russia
apart.
The Times adds that it is sure the
British Government is prepared to give
fuller recognition to accomplished facts
in the Northern Chinese provinces and
to assist Russia in regularizing her po
sition on the basis of reciprocity.
This remark of the Times shows that'
the British now. accept the Russifica
tion of Manchuria as an accomplished
fact, and they only expect their Gov,
ernment to secure compensation in
other directions.

THE SAIST FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 12, 1899.
DECLINE PROMOTION
AT THE EXPENSE OF
FELLOW-OFFICERS
WASHINGTON, March 11.â Two
things, in the opinion of Secre
tary Long, so creditable to the
naval service have occurred re
cently that they deserve to be made
public. One is the request of Rear Ad
miral Higginson, which is contained in
the following letter:
WASHINGTON. D. C. March 10, 1899.
Sir: I respectfully request to be allowed
to resume my former number on the na
val list after Rear Admiral Kempff. While
deeply grateful to the President and your
self for my nomination for work done off
Santiago. I do not regard my own services
as so conspicuous as to warrant my ad
vancement while th other commanding
officers nominated at the same nine as
myself go unrewarded. They were a gal
lant band of naval officers and certainly
deserved well of their country, and. if
their services are to go unrecognized I
desire to share the same fate. Very re
spectfully,
FRANCIS J. HIGGINSON,
Rear Admiral. U. S. N.
To Hon. J. D. Long, Secretary of the
Navy.
Rear Admiral Higginson's name was
on the long list sent to the Senate by
the President for advancement for ser
vices off Santiago. Probably by inad
vertence, Admiral Higginson was con
firmed apart from the rest which the
Senate adjourned without confirming.
Secretary Long has addressed the fol
lowing letter to the admiral:
Will you let me express my high appre
ciation of your very handsome and con
siderate conduct in asking to resume your
former number on the navy list rather
than to accept the advancement which
places you above other officers who, for
their gallant services in the recent war,
deserved recognition but failed to receive
it owing to the failure of the Senate to
act upon the recommendations sent In by
the President. The spirit which you mani
fest is so admirable that I hasten to write
you this letter.
The other is the case of Lieutenant
Aaron Ward, who was recommended
by the board of promotions* for ad
vancement. On learning of this he
wrote to the department, declining ad
vancement, inasmuch as it gave him
precedence over his classmate. Lieuten
ant Staunton, stating that he did not
feel that the actions in which his ves
sel was engaged were of so great value
as to justify him in availing himself of
the opportunity. '
"It is impossible," said he, "for me
willingly to accept a promotion which
deprives such an officer of a commis
sion in the highest grade."
The recommendation made by the
board of promotions in the case of
Lieutenant Ward was not sent in to
the Senate, all the promotions- recom
mended by that board having been held
back to await the result of those which
have been pending since the opening of
the session and which the Senate ad
journed without confirming.

CRIES THE MOB
Castro Hearing Excites
Castroville.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALINAS, March 11.â For a few mm
utes this afternoon Peter Castro, the i
alleged assailant of Mrs. James L.
Douglass, was again face to face with
death. Once more the action of Sheriff
Farley prevented a tragedy. The pre
liminary hearing of Castro had just
been concluded and Judge Clark had
announced that he would hold Castro
under $5000 bonds to answer in the Su
perior Court when mutterings were
heard in the court. Sheriff Farley and
his deputies hurried the prisoner out
of the courtroom to a carriage. Cries
of "Get a rope! Hang him! Hang him!"
were heard from all parts of the street.
Shoving Castro into the vehicle, Far
ley turned with his hands on his re
volvers and-' faced the crowd in a de
i termined attitude. For five minutes he
i â¢stood here, and the mob was cowed.
! Jumping into the carriage, he was
' driven away with Castro and Peter
i Silva in custody. Both were lodged in
| jail here later.
Sensations were plentiful this after
i noon during the hearing of Castro.
! "Buck" Silva testified that Castro had
j told him on the evening of the tragedy i
1 that he would get money before morn- j
, ing, so as to leave Castroville and go |
!to the city. When he swore to this the !
i prisoner called out that it was an "mi
i fernal lie." Questioning Silva, Castro ;
, made him admit they had entered an |
1 unoccupied hotel and slept together i
i after having been in company all day,
! and that both were near the Douglass
house twenty minutes before the out
\ rage is alleged to have been committed.
! Despite the testimony of several repu
! table citizens and the report by Father
Mahoney and others that the odor of
coal oil could be detected on Castro's
1 clothes, Silva swore he had not noticed
j the odor at any time.
As Silva was about to step from the
i witness stand, Judge Clark called him
j back and asked why when he was out on
! his own recognizance on a charge of ag
gravated assault he had sneaked away
j beyond the court's jurisdiction and had
testified he was again about to do so.
Silva. in a spirit of bravado, replied he. !
could not be convicted on that or any
other charge. Judge Clark thereupon
ordered the Sheriff to take Silva into
custody, and put him under $2500 bonds.
This is preliminary to the arrests of
others for alleged connection with the
Douglass and Dailey outrages.
When the excitement caused by the
arrest of Sllva had subsided, Castro
made a statement, giving the names of
all his companions on the night of the
assault. He denied that he was drunk,
or that he was the assailant of Mrs.
Douglass. He said "Buck" Silva, Sal
vador Silva, Peter SUva, Charles Eng
land and himself were near the Doug
lass residence. They had a friendly
scuffle, during which Peter Silva
scratched his face. This was the fourth
explanation Castro has given for the
scratches on his face, and all are dif
ferent.
REAR ADMIRAL HIGGINSON.
list four companies of natives of not more
than 100 men each.
General Henry said he believed such ac
tion would have an excellent effect upon
the natives, who seemed to be auspicious
of the purposes of the United States. It
would not be difficult to get good men
who could be uniformed and armed in
Porto Rico and would always be required
to serve with regular troops, thus minim
izing the danger of an outbreak.
It is expected General Henry will as
sign white officers to the native com
panies and some of the white enlisted
men as non-commissioned officers.
TEHAMA'S SHERIFF
ARRESTS M'GEEHEE
RED BLUFF. March 11.â Sheriff Bo
gard returned this evening from Manton,
bringing with him M. McGeehee, who
shot and dangerously wounded his step
son, Zachariah Brown. It appears that
McGeehee and Brown were in town dur
ing the day and both were somewhat in
toxicated when they left. On arriving at
home a quarrel ensued and McGeehee left
and went to a neighbor named Spencer,
returning with Spencer to the house after
a few minutes. According to the story
told by his wife, there was a rifle in the
house and it was in some unaccountable
manner discharged. This led McGeehee
to believe he was being shot at and he
fired into the house: He was only about
four feet distant from Brown. The bullet
entered Brown's cheek, breaking tho
cheek and jaw and lodging in the neck.
Dr. Muscott says the wound is not neces
sarily fatal.
ANDERSON. March 11.â Brown, the
victim of the Manton shooting affray, was

TON, March 11. There will probably be four vacant seats in the next -O
Senate. It is expected here that the California Legislature will follow g
Utah's example and adjourn without an election. Quay cannot be elected Â§

that body are apparently no nearer reaching an agreement than when Â£Â»

of indemnity made to the United States
instead of the island of Porto Rico.
Embassador Cambon replied as fol
lows, dated Washington, D. C, Au
gust 4:
As I expected, Mr. McKinley showed '
inflexibility, and repeated that the Phil- :
ippine question was the only one which
had not been already settled in his mind.
I took up this point and begged the Pres
ident to state to me his intentions, as far
as possible, concerning the Philippines.
On this point I said that the terms
of the United States as written might De
construed to mean that Spanish sover
eignty in the Philippine archipelago was
at an end. Mr. McKinley answered:
"i will not leave you In error on this
subject. The Commissioners of the two
countries will determine the Philippine
questionâ will settle the question as to
which shall be the governing nation
there."
He said that the Government of Spain
could rest assured that "up to the pres
ent time I have formed no conclusions on
this matter, and have formed no resolve
against Spain."
The protocol was signed immediately
and Spain named her commissioners.
The following secret, instructions were
issued to the commissioners serving for
Spain on the evacuation commissions
in Cuba and Porto Rica:
You must explain that the word "evac
! uation" as employed in the protocol means
! nothing more than that the naval and mil
itary forces of Spain shall leave the isl
ands. It does not mean the retirement of
civil functionaries or civil employes of the
administration. You should allow the
American Commissioners to bring this
question up. If It Is to come up, and then
protest that the meaning of the word as
given here is so self-evident that there
was no question in your minds as to it.
If there is controversy you can take time

Dr. Muscott. The bullet was in three

hours' time to pick it out.
Government that the occupation of the
bay and city of Manila by the American
forces must be dec'ded by article 111 of
the protocol and not by the capitulation
of the 14th inst., which Spain holds to be
absolutely null and void, having been en
tered into after the legal susoension of
hostilities. . The Spanish Government must
Insist that the evacuation of the bay and
city of Manila does not give the Ameri
cans the right to make any change in the
existing law in the archipelago. Spain
nolds that the United States must respect
Spanish law in the Philippines, and that
the present statutes of the civil, judicial
and political authorities shall remain as
the Americans found them. The future
government of the islands is to be de
termined by the commission.
On September 22 Embassador Cam
bon sent this to the Minister of Foreign
Affairs at Madrid: B
T .he United States Government is in
receipt of the note of the Spanish Govern
ment of September 5. It believes that this
note was dispatched before the answer to
Spain s note of the sth had been received
The American Government desires me to
communicate with the Government of her
Majesty that It cannot agree in your
opinion that the capitulation of Manila is
null and void, even though it occurred
after the signing of the protocol. Hos
tilities were suspended in the Philippines
directly upon the receipt of the news of
the . signing of , the protocol. It appear*-*
that this is a late reflection on the part
of Spain, as nothing of this nature has
appeared in previous communications
from that Government.
The red book contains the full text |
of the protest which the Spanish Gov- j
, ernment made, in which Spain seeks to
prove that Admiral Dewey's commun- |
ications to the War Department con- !
cerning the condition of the families of
Spanish prisoners were false. An at- I
tack is made on Admiral Dewey in the j
allegation that his conduct proves him
to be an accomplice of the Tagals.
Spain insists that it is in possession of
authentic reports which contradict
those received from Admiral Dewey.
The claim is made that rumors are
current in Spain that the American
Government is preparing to send mili
tary expeditions and warships to Ma
nila during the suspension of. hostili
ties. This is asserted to be in open vio
lation of the stipulations of the proto
col. The note concludes:
The Spanish Cabinet is desirous of ob
taining from the United States an official
repudiation of these rumors, which seem
each day to become stronger and more
â  persistent. _^_ ___

GENERAL MAXIMO
GOMEZ IMPEACHED
Removed From Cuban
Army's Command.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, March 11.â Cuban
Military Assembly, in public session
this afternoon, impeached General
Maximo Gomez and removed him from
his command as general-in-chief of the
Cuban army, the first ballot taken re
sulting in twenty-six votes being cast
in support of the motion to Impeach
and remove General Gomez, against
four in opposition. The meeting lasted
from 2 o'clock until 7.
General Gomez' only supporters "were
General Cespedes and General Nunez.
The original motion, which was intro
duced by Senor Manuel Sanguilly, pro
vided for the abolition of the grade of
general-in-chief, but an amendment
was offered to this by Senor Aguerro,
which read: "To abolish the grade of
general-in-chief and to remove General
Gomez for failure in his military duties
and disobedience to the Assembly."
Senor Aguerro declared that Gomez
was insubordinate and should be pun
ished, and Senor Sanguilly insinuated
that the general was a traitor to Cuba.
Much passion was evident in the
speeches, in some of which Gomez was
declared to have been delinquent in
his duties and disobedient because he
had accepted the proposition of Robert
P. Porter, President McKinley's special
emissary, without consulting the As
sembly; because he had taken upon
himself the arrangements for the pay
ment and disarming of the Cuban
troops independent of the Assembly,
and because he had declared to the
Assembly that he would observe its
rulings in so far as he could see them
beneficial to Cuba. W_t
The Assembly then declared that the
$3,000,000 is insufficient and that it has
not yet accepted the proposition. The
discussion of this question will soon
be taken up, now that General Gomez
has beep removed.
Senor Gonzales de Queseda. who ac
companied Mr. Porter in Cuba, was at
tacked by Senors Gualberto Gomez,
Sanguilly and Aguerro, who declared
that he had acted in bad faith and had
deceived them. Senor Aguerro likened
the present conditions confronting the
Assembly to those that confronted the
French Chamber when it was proposed
to impeach President MacMahon.
Colonel Mora and General Nunez de
clared that the present step was use
less and would make the Assembly
ridiculous in, the eyes of the world.
Among the principal speakers were
Senors Sanguilly, Andrade, Aguerro,
Gualberto Gomez, Cespedes, Nunez,
Villalon and Lastra.
To-morrow General Gomez will be
officially notified of the Assembly's ac
tion. General Gomez is believed to be
stronger than the Assembly in the af
fection of the Cuban army. Many pri
vates are anxious to leave the army
and go to work, especially when they
are able to obtain money to start them
in life anew.
The position of the Assembly is no
tably weak, as the military administra
tion supports Gomez, also the planters
and property-owning element, who are
tired of the Cuban army, which subsists
half . upon charity and half upon con
tributions levied by means of threats.
General Gomez received a telephone
message announcing to him the . As
sembly's decision. He answered calm-
ly: "All right, I enjoy the situation."

FOR CORDIAL RELATIONS
PORTEJct'S WORK TO PROMOTE
TRADE APPRECIATED.
-A.ll Newspapers of Berlin Make Fav
orable Comment Except the Agra
rian Press, Which Still Harps
on Our Bad Meat.
Plghted, IS?9, by the Associated Press.
.LIN. March 11.â At the annual
latic dinner given by the Emperor
of Germany on Wednesday his Majesty
again warmly thanked the United
States Embassador, Andrew D. White,
for his efforts in re-establishing more
cordial relations between the two coun
tries. Mr. White, in replying, said the
Emperor's gracefully expressed sym
pathy in regard to Rudyard Kipling
had an excellent effect in the United
States. His Majesty thereupon started
to converse on the subject of Kipling
and his works, saying that the jungle
stories were favorites with him, the
hunting excursions especially. The
Emperor added that he admired Kip
ling's keen, quick insight into nature,
human or otherwise, surrounding him.
Emperor William then talked of
architecture and sculpture, with special
reference to Berlin. His Majesty looks
more robust and stronger than ever.
He has fully recovered from the effects
or" his Palestine journey.
Th* Minister of foreign Affairs,
Baron yon Bulow, and Mr. White also
conversed at some length and picas- j
antly.
Although Robert P. Porter, since his
arrival here, has repeatedly announced
to the official world and to th*. press
that his miss: is in no wise author
ized by the United States Government,
his stay here has attracted considerable
attention and is productive of good re
;. suits. A series of interviews ha_. ap
peared in some of the leading papers,
in which Mr. Porter has strongly point
ed out the mutual advantages of inti
mate and uninterrupted calm relations
between the two countries. The com
ments on his utterances have been ex
tensive and varied. The Agrarian press
does not look favorably upon them.
The Kreuz Zeitung takes exception ni
the fact that Mr. Porter has nowhere
hinted at American concessions and
says: "'Under ... circumstances it
would be most uiffieult for Germany to
conclude a commercial treaty with the
United States."
The semi-official Post disputes the
correctness of Mr. Porter's ngui-es on i
the subject of German exports to the
United States, denies the justness of j
his conclusions, and adds: "It is un
deniable that German imports from the
United States vastly increased during ;
1S98; while the exports to America de- '
creased 53,000.000 compared with IS9J;
and 40,000,000 compared with L 896."
ThÂ«. commercial and Liberal press,
however, hail Mr. Porter's declarations
with satisfaction. The Cologne Gazette
says: "We believe the statements or j
Mr. Porter have done both countries i
service, similar to one Baron yon Bu- !
low did the other day in pointing out \
â¢ thir ets favorable to _, friendly inter-!
course between Germany and th*
United States. More than this, .' is j
pointed out how useful to both would ;
be a friendly commercial policy, and j
still more it'will be seen that it will
not be half so difficult to maintain as
many people suppose. Both countries
are thus better served than by attack- j
ing Mr. Porter's reasonable statements,
in which the Agrarian press indulges,
thus putting itself on the level with
th- so-called yellow press of America. j
The Government will not follow the !
Agrarian into a tariff war unless the
road to a commercial treaty is blocked ]
by insurmountable obstacles, and the
quiet, thoughtful manner In which in- i
fluential Americans have been discuss- ;
ing matters permits no hope that such
obstacles will arise."
A number of other influential papers
discussed the matter in a similar strain.
"While the Government has taken pains
to show- Mr. Porter's efforts toward a |
better understanding commercially beÂ« |
tween the two cquntries are duly ap- i
preciated. Baron yon Bulow, of Is own :
volition, has asked Mr. White to bring
Mr- Porter to the diplomatic reception
on Wednesday, as the Foreign Minister
â¢wishes to converse with Mr. Porter.
Similar invitations have been extended
. to Mr. Porter by the Secretary of the
Interior, Count yon Posadowsky-
Wehner. and the Secretary of the Im
perial Treasury, Baron yon Thielman.
At th* instance of the Government,
Mr. Porter this week fully explained
the new tariffs of Cuba and Port Rico
to a commission of experts. Mr. Por
ter explains to the correspondent here
of the Associated Press that a serious
discrepancy exists between the figures
of the imports and exports of German>
and the United States furnished to the
United States Treasury and those ap- j
parently drawn from German official
sources and quoted in the Agrarian
press. This explains the different con
clusions reached.
The fore part of the week was spent
by Mr. Porter at Magdeburg, studying !
the sugar question from the German !
point of view. A man principally in- i
terested in the industry told Mr. Porter
that it is hoped the United States will
waive the discriminating tariff on Ger
man sugar as a preliminary condition
to the inclusion of a commercial '
treaty. He also furnished statements
apparently showing that the large Ger
man manufacturers can produce sugar
as low as 2 cents a pound, which, if
true, will enable them to compete with ;
Cuban sugar.
The United States Embassador gave a
dinner to-night in honor of Mr. Porter.
The guests included Dr. Miquel. the
Minister of Finance: Herr Wagner, the
social economist: Herr Siemens, Herr
Loewe and a number of persons inter
ested in industrial pursuits.
The testimony in the Miles-Eagan
dispute at Washington has furnished
the Agrarian press here with welcome
material for the war on American meat.
Some of the comments are extremely
uncomplimentary to the American
packers. The Kreuz Zeitung says:
"Since the testimony of General Miles
has proved that the packers are so con
scienceless as to furnish totally unfit
meat to their own soldiers at the front
they would certainly not scruple to sell
similar meat to foreigners. We hope
these facts will net be lost sight of
when the new meat inspection Mil is
considered in the Reichstag."
As the Reichstag adjourns for Easter
on March 22 the meat inspection bill j
will not be discussed until the middle
of April. The chances of its passage
In the present shape have diminished
latterly, owing to the revelations of
General' Miles and also to the vigorous |
agitation of the Agrarian press.
* The correspondent of the Associated .
PreÂ«=s learns that the Government will
9 not object seriously to slight changes
in th* wording of the bill, but an
amendment in the manner sought by
-the Agrarians would render it unac
ceptable, y â¢

cadets will be doubled.
Some of the newspapers said that
Admiral yon Knorr is retiring because
of persona! differences with the Em
peror on the subject of changes in the
cadet system. This, the correspondent
of the Associated Press is informed, is
untrue. On the contrary, intimate cor
i dial relations exist between the Em
peror and Admiral yon Knorr, who is
addressed by his Majesty by his Cnrist
ian name Edward, and these relations
will continue until broker.. It Is as
serted that the admiral is not the only
high official thus honored by the Em
peror. Baron yon Bulow is also fa
miliarly dubbed Bernhard by his Ma

Interesting tests of wireless telegra

experiments have been successful.
Emperor William has presented the

moan dispatches, published up to yes
terday by the Reichsanzeiger, saying
they bear out the former German offi
cial statements and flatly contradict
the essential points of Mr. Chambers*
letters. ,: ; --*^:
The Vossische Zeitung thinks the
documents show that the German offi
cials in Samoa have strictly adhered to
the Berlin treaty, 'and the Cologne
Yolks Zeitung reproduces the version
of the affair credited to Mr. H. I.
Moors, an American merchant of Apia,
saying it fully corroborates'the German
contentions. .; â  :
A number of papers attacked the
Government's so-called concessions at
Manila. The Rhenish Westphalian Zei
tung says the withdrawal of the Ger
man ships is inexplicable, "as the dan
ger to German life and property in th*
Philippines is more Imminent now than
in 1898." Â'â¢
The paper also condemns the super
cession of Admiral yon Diedrichs. and
asks if the admiral is now to be thrown
into the scrapiron heap merely because
the Foreign Office suddenly feels the
necessity of becoming friends with the
Americans.
Two meat importers of Mannheim,

Washington, March 11. .
The Supervising Architect's office is :
busy with preliminary arrangements
toward the erection of sixty odd new
public buildings. Chief Executive Offi- j
cer Kemper said to The Call corre- |
spondent to-day that by the end of the i
; month he would cause to be published j
advertisements asking for proposals for i
| sites for all the public bpildings, in- j
I eluding Oakland. The Los Angeles and
Stockton sites are already available. j
! These advertisements will run for" two j
or three weeks, at the end of which i
| time the bids will be opened. It does j

tionary with the Secretary of the
Treasury. Before the acceptance of any
site offered it is usual to send a special
agent of the treasury to examine such
site, and upon his report to the Secre
tary the Attorney General is asked to
approve the title. In all cases it is
necessary for the Legislature to cede
exclusive jurisdiction over such sites to
the Federal Government.
The Call correspondent asked the
Supervising Architect whether the Gov
ernment is empowered to accept as a
bonus any property offered by citizens
as an inducement to the erection of a
Postoffic building in any particular sec
tion of the city. He said that the Gov
ernment could not accept an absolute
bonus. Some consideration must be
named even if it were but one dollar in
order to literally comply with the act
of Congress authorizing the â¢'purchase"
of the site. It has already come to tha
notice of the department officials that
in various cities where new postoffices
have been provided for real estate
agents hav/e formed combinations in.
order to secure the location of the
building in their section of the city in
order to enhance the value of their
property. In some instances they pro
pose either tcf donate property or sell It
at a nominal price to the Government.

take part in an exposition to be held in that city
in 1901, and now comes Buffalo with an invitation to
the Pan-American exposition which she proposes to
open in the same year. Each of these desires us to
make a State appropriation and fit California out for
a brilliant display at its festival.
To both of these invitations we shall have to return
thanks with regrets at our inability to attend as a
State owing to a previous engagement. California is
herself preparing for a Pacific Ocean exposition to
be held in San Francisco in that year, and all the
money and energy she can afford for such purposes â ,
will be needed to provide for the undertaking.
The veiy fact that such progressive cities as Buffalo
and Glasgow have selected 1901 as the year for hold
ing their expositions is a proof the opportunities of
that year for- grand displays will be so exceptionally
good that sagacious men both in the Old World and
in the New are eager to take advantage of them. In
deed, it will be many years before so favorable a sea
son comes again as that which will follow the great
fair to be held in Paris in 1000, and for that reason,
while we recognize the wisdom of the choice of date
determined upon by Buffalo and Glasgow, we cannot
consent to postpone" our exposition for the purpose of
appropriating State money for theirs.
It is notable that the Examiner, which opposes the
California enterprise, favors an appropriation for the
Buffalo exposition. It declared yesterday a'display"at
that place would be a good advertisement, while it
has several times of late maintained that an exposi
tion at home would be no advertisement at all.
Such views of course carry their refutation on their
face, and to be answered need only to be stated. They
are peculiar to the organ of a non-resident who
patronizes nothing in the city except the crematory,
to which he sends his paper with other garbage to be
burned, and nothing in the State outside the city ex
cept the jute mills at San Quentin, from which the
Examiner has been in the habit of obtaining its
piiscn-made twine.
Fiom the non-resident patron of the garbage fur
nace and the penitentiary it is not necessary to take
an appeal. The Examiner's sneer, and snarl at
everything Californian and its laudation of every
thing in New York is a part of the habit acquired by
non-residents who lose all State and civic patriotism
and look upon California as an outlying province
whose industries and interests can be advertised only
by making them subordinate features of an exposi
tion held in Europe or the metropolitan East.
The issue is one the people and the Legislature
will clearly understand. The intelligence of the
world recognizes that 1901 will be exceptionally fa
vorable for exposition purposes, and the intelligence
of the State recognizes that California should in
some way profit by the opportunities it will afford.
The sole question is, Shall we expend our money for
expositions abroad, or for an exposition at home?
Shall we send samples of our industries to be mingled
with varied displays in far-away States, or shall we
attract the attention of the world to California and the
Pacific Coast?
Non-residents may haggle over such questions, but
true Californians will not hesitate a moment in giving
the answer. Whatever money we have for exposi
tions in 1901 must be devoted to the home enter
prise.
A female swindler in New York is likely to es

While on the stand the first time was so shamefully
abused that he does not propose to undergo the ex

courts. To be a witness is really no crime.
When city ordinances forbid expectoration on the
sidewalk the offense of spitting in a man's face is
naturally regarded as much more serious. Just as
likely as not the next victim will consider it a capital
crime.

RACETRACK GAMBLING.
OF all forms in which the gambling habit pre
sents itself the racetrack has proved most
ruinous. The sport of speed contests ,be
| tween horses is very. ancient, and has been largely the
means of important experimental breeding of that
j noble animal. The American thoroughbred horse
j originated in this sport. Diomed, winner of the first
Derby in England, was imported to this country and
was the ancestor- of our thoroughbred strain.
! Rysdyk's Hambletonian, about whose" breeding little
i; certainly known, but whose performance as ' a
trotter, an unnatural gait, at high speed, ma-ked him
at once a wonderful horse, was the ancestor of the
American trotter. These two strains of horses have
stimulated the American love for the horse and have
been the means of giving to this country certain
equine families that greatly excel. But the noble
trials of speed and endurance which have accom
panied this development have had many degenerate
imitations and ignoble results. The rise of the horse
has been balanced by the fall of man wherever open
facilities for track gambling have been tolerated.
The State of New Jersey long ago felt the burden
of track gambling, and its eradication became an j
issue in State politics. California is feeling keenly the j
curse of this practice. It is a form of the gambling \
habit the easiest to acquire, the most convenient to
practice and the most demoralizing in its results.
Women, boys and youths do not frequent the faro
game, nor the poker-room, nor do they throw dice
in the public places where alone that habit is in
dulged. But they find buying pools on "the races
easy, quite possible without their personal presence
and with all the fascination which the goddess o'i
Chance exerts upon her votaries.
The result is that, inspired by this passion, good
women become bad women, boys dishonor their
parents and trusted employes rob ' their employers.
In this city the list of these offenses originating in
track gambling is a long one, and every case is black
with lost reputation, the sorrow of families and losses
of employers. None of these things would be possi
ble if the pools were forbidden. In the earlier' days
of racing such demoralization was impossible. If
any desired to back with his money his judgment on
the speed of a horse he had to find on the spot some
one" of the opposite opinion and the willingness to j
back it. Boys and clerks, who don't know- haw from
gee about a horse and feel no partisanship for a favor
ite animal, for they have no judgment about it, would
not be found wagering under such a system, and the
widespread, increasing and insufferable evils that now
exist would be impossible. One reply is always. made
to every effort to extirpate this moral cancer. It is
always characterized as enmity to the sport of horse
racing and intended to destroy public interest in that
noblest of our domestic animals. But, set against i
this is the fact that the kind of gamblers whose |
patronage pays the pooling profits and fattens those |
who prey upon, the public by that means know little
or nothing about horses, are ignorant of the external j
points which mark the qualities of brain and nerve, of
wind, bottom and speed for which the horse is ad
mired and bred. To them the horse is simply a
means of convenient gambling, a way in which they
can risk their own money in the hope of gain, and
when they lose it comes the temptation to forgery, j
theft, embezzlement, burglary, highway robbery and
other criminal means tor getting another stake in the
hope of winning back what was lost.
' Not only are all these crimes against, property
caused by track gambling. Other, evils follow. The
excitement of the habit, its fluctuations of luck, its
alternating hope and despair, undermine the nervous
system and resort is had to drink and opium. The ]
use of the latter is a most common result of track
gambling, especially in the case of youths and women. ,
To put a stop to the source of these crying evils is
the first duty of the economist and moralist alike. It '
is a promoter of vice and crime to a degree not en
tirely known to the public. â¢ The record, of its blight
is in domestic discords, on the slabs of the morgue,
in the insane asylums and prisons. Let it be abol
ished.
WHAT'S IN A NAME?
ALL around Puget Sound rages a wordful war,
and back and forth, the rattling press among, j
leaps the live thunder. Out from Tacoma '
flashes the lightning of a fiery wrath. Seattle, from
her misty shroud, darts electric charges back and
answers her aloud, while all the neighboring towns
and villages array themselves on one side or the other i
and echo with manifold reduplications every sound of
war that roars, tumultuous through the moist and j
foggy air.
Now the cause of all these frequent repetitions of
taunt and threat, of all these wild reverberations as of
thunder in the mountains, is merely a name. Shall
the Government reservation just laid out on the
shores of Puget Sound be called "Mount Rainier
Park" or "Mount Tacoma Park"? That is the ques
tion.
To outsiders the settlement of such a question
would appear simply a matter of taste, but to the in
siders it is not a matter of tasting. It is something
they have to chew, swallow and inwardly digest.
Hence the agitation of the issue has reached such a
degree of violence that it shakes the State, makes
the overarching welkin ring until the cerulean dome
is nearly cracked, and so disturbs the somnolent clam
in his oozy bed on the Puget shores, that he has the
nightmare, imagines himself a sea-serpent and joins
the cry for gore.
In her calmer moods. Tacoma asserts that to call j
the park "Rainier" would be a wrong to herself, a
mockery to the State, an offense to the nation and an i
insult to American manhood. This fellow Rainier, she
declares, was an unnaturalized foreigner, a blarsted
Britisher of French descent, who ;; came rubber
necking around the Sound many years ago and went
away again without settling, laying out a new town
or even publishing a boom pamphlet.
Why name a park after that vagabond? Tacoma
says if the country cannot rise to the height of a
genuine poetic nomenclature and call the reservation
Tacoma Park, it should call it Washington Park, or '
j Puget Park, or any old park, but not Ramier â and
j incidentally not Seattle. ' "â¢ â 
All these allegations of wrong, mockery, offense :
; and insult Seattle treats not with silent contempt, but
hurls them back with scorn. It is the process of j
hurling back that makes the noise. Not the hurtling ;
of cannon-balls, the shriek of shells- the roar of lions |
j in their iungles, the bellow of the behemoth, or e\cn ,
the screaming of the whangdoodle in the mountains
of Hcpsidam, moves the currents of the atmosphere
to such eddying whirlpools of horrid sounds as does
the raucous voice of Seattle answering Tacoma on this i
proposition, and with an uproar quite as dreadful does !
Tacoma thunder back. .'â¢' Â /
When it is added that to the tort and retort of the
chief combatants there arc joined all the echoing itera- \
tions and reiterations of the lesser Puget settlements, j
it will be understood that the result can be expressed I
only in John Milton's terse, tumultuous phrase, "All \
j hell broke loose."
Such, then, is the cause of the strange noises which ,

THE NON-PARTISAN VENDETTA.
[ IN declaring war upon the new. primary law our
I distinguished fellow citizen, Deacon Fitch, has un
[ * dertaken a contest in which the very existence of
his party is at stake. If the statute goes into operation
unmolested no such an organization as that now main-'
tamed by the Non-Partisans can exist for a single
moment. Mr. Fitch's party consists of fifty gentle
men, mostly ultra-conservative and non-residents.
The fact that a man lives in Alameda, San Rafael or
even San Jose is no disqualification to serve as a dele
gate to the so-called Non-Partisan "convention." The
members were originally appointed by Mr. Fitch, and
there have been no reappointments except to fill
places made vacant by death or resignation. The
position of delegate to the Non-Partisan "conven
tion," therefore, is a perpetual trust wliich terminates
only with the existence of the man who holds it.
In order to get a place upon the official ballot un
der the new primary law a political organization is
required to hold an election for delegates in all the
precincts of the city. Candidates nominated by com
mittees or by petition must be designated as "inde
pendent," and unless a convention is made represen
tative by primary action it cannot rise to the dignity
of being a political party and cannot get for its can
didates a position on the ballot opposite a party
name.
If the Non-Partisans hold a primary election for
delegates to their "convention" Mr. Fitch will be
compelled to abandon his close corporation idea and
make his party a popular affair. If he do this he
will at once lose control of the machine and Non-
Partisanism will become just as public an institution
as Democracy or Republicanism. â¢ Of course Mr.
Fitch will never think of doing any such thing as this,
and, like an able politician â which he is â he has
started after the primary law via the Supreme Court.
Tie has appointed a committee of five to investigate
"the legal phases of the subject, and doubtless this will <
result in the employment of attorneys and the in- J
auguration of a contest designed to put a quietus upon j
the statute.
We shall watch the vendetta between the Non-
Partisans and the primary law with" great interest. If
the former's attempt to fasten their committee of
fifty upon the politics of the city triumphs it will only
be another indication of the power which can be ex
ercised by a lot of property-owning citizens banded
together for the purpose of disturbing the peace of
the professional politicians. Were the Non-Partisans
all residents of San Francisco, or were they in favor
of anything but stagnation and silurianism, they
would constitute a powerful element in our politics.
1-N writing of the Morehouse bill requiring every
writer in a newspaper to sign each article from his
pen we would say naught in malice. Surely if
Morehouse has the courage to back and thus forward
such a freak the journalistic scribe whose business is
to present sane ideas, clothed in the language sug
gested by common sense, has no reason to complain.
Neither would we refer harshly to the Senate for'
having passed the measure, for it is more in sorrow
than in anger we realize that body has put its intellec
tuality on display. Nor, since one must speak well of
the dead, is it seemly to give the dying too lusty a
biff.
Aside from being devoid of the element of reason,
based on splenetic affection of the mental parts,
silly, useless and ridiculous, the measure may have
much to commend it. No writer for a daily paper
is afraid to sign his work. The reason he does not
sign it is that he is working under orders. Often
times he passes to print matter directly contrary to his
own judgment. He does it with a clear conscience,
knowing himself to be no more responsible than the
mechanical typewriter through which the words may
reach print. The proprietor of the paper is respon
sible for its contents. No matter if another indi
vidual be drawn into the vortex of the thunderous
eddy of Morehouse wrath, the ultimate penalty would
fall upon the man who paid the salary.
Much of the comment in a modern daily paper ap
pears tinder or over the name of a special writer, and
this without compulsion, but the general editorial has
a place beneath the name of the editor and proprietor.
This would seem to definitely fix responsibility. The
Senate evidently is of another opinion, and to bow to
the opinion of a body so august is the blessed privi
lege of us all.
Possibly there is behind the measure some hope that
the obligation to drag into the light the names of
bashful contributors, who from possession of the un-
Senatorial quality of modesty like to do their good
deeds on the quiet (or something to this effect) and
blush to find it fame, will scare these writers into a
different pursuit. There is no need to build a hope on
this conjecture. Not all the Morehouses this side of
the place whither the Morehouses are going can pre
vent the expression of a single fact nor cause the
altering of a phrase. The writers do not know what
Morehouse takes them for, but they take him for a
joke. KyMr

There will be advanced in behalf of the
murderers the plea either of self-de

would be found good in any instance.
If the homicidal tendency so frequently
displayed is the result of insanity this

is that people here commit murder be

Irritation and regret. The subject of

At present there is a way of supplying
them to such children as make open

the children coming from humble homes

I pers, and on this subject. the careless
i tongue of yputh administers many a
sting. The result is that wage-earners
1 who cannot afford to do so buy books
for their children and the burden is
hard to bear. There are many ex
pensive and useless books, and frequent
changes, the latter precluding the possi
bility of disposing of second-hand arith
metics and geographies or passing them
from child to child as the elder enters
a new grade. For the State to buy
the books would entail a considerable
cost, but the extra expenditure would
come easily within the amount now
wasted or stolen. With honest direct
ors there would not only be an end to
larceny, but to the common and frivo
lous substitutions now in vogue. In my
opinion the text book Is as properly a

The trust may be a necessary evil,
but it can reach a point at which, while
it remains potently evil, it is no longer
necessary. Some of the recent aggre
gations of capital have been startling
enough and that of the Eastern coal
interests, now being manipulated by J.
Pierpont Morgan, promises to be ap
palling. The combined capital, it is
stated, will be more than $8.89,000,000.
To explain the occasion for this the
fact is set forth that there will be an
annual saving in expenses amounting
to $3,200,000. Think of it! The owners
of the mines, with more money than
they know what to do with, made rich
by the sweat of underground toilers
far worse conditioned than the slaves
of the South ever were, can save all
this money. Perhaps they will devote
it to charity, for in the absence of char

though his. terms as a prisoner ought
to have given him an inkling of its
existence. I have no doubt that in the
ranks he was a mischief-maker and
that the regiment is well rid of him. As
to his allegations of outrageous con
duct on the part of officers of the First
California, I deem them as false and
malicious, as they assuredly are con
temptible. Rees is evidently an egotist
to the point of actual mania. With
careful nursing he might .outgrow it.

The medical student who throws th"
head of a human subject into a garbage
heap to be carted away with offal and
cremated with dead cats is worse than
a brute. If the latest degenerate to be
guilty of this outrage will forward his
picture I will use all my Influence to
get it published. It would form an ex
cellent start for a rogues' gallery.

Good Russell Sage is pained at what
he chooses to term the extravagances
of the rich. I do not think the rich can
have any extravagances. The only peo
ple who are capable of this fault are
those who expend on luxuries so much
that they may suffer for necessities.
Money is good only for the things it
can be made to do. In itself it is worth
less, and to me the man who heaps it
up ' million upon million, with n 
thought beyond seeing the pile grow, is
a fool. Sage makes the mistake of con
founding God -Almighty, whom he pro
fesses to worship, but doesn't, with thÂ«
god money, which he professes not to
worship, but does.

OAKLAND FERRYâ City. The
question asked by another correspondent
in relation to the ferry-boat Oakland was
"Was the Oakland now in the Oakland

The ferry-boat Oakland never was In the
Sacramento River trade, and. according to
the official list of United States vessels.
Issued by the Bureau of Navigation of the
Treasury Department of ' the United
States, she was built in Oakland in _575.
The question did not involve any question
as to the Oakland having been built up
from the old Chrysopolis. When that
question is asked it will be answered.
INCINERATION. â A correspondent
who is interested in one of the cremato

strictly correct, and sends a circular in
which there' is the following: "It is gen
orally understood and believed that in the
process of cremation the remains are
taken from the casket and wrapped In a
winding sheet, many being under the im
pression that even the clothing Is re

modern crematories have changed tne
method, and except in cases where metal
lic caskets are used, the remains are pever
touched or handled, being always incin

and metallic trimmings only being re

iEMBLANCE OF A CONTEST
YELLOW TALL AGAIN PROVES A
DISAPPOINTMENT.
Two Lonely Favorites in Frontâ Kitty
Kelly Shows Her Speed to Ad
âFormero Wins the
Handicap.
The crowd at Corrlg-an's track yesterday
-which, by the way, was no larger nu
merically than the usual plain Saturday
gatheringâ was treated to a run of the
old-fashioned sortâ at two and a quarter
miles, the cup distance. It was the stake
feature of the card, and proved utterly
devoid cf all excitement. First money
went where it was most neededâ Ed
Corrigan. The starters in this grand ex
hibition of stamina and speed were: The
Bachelor, a stake horse if the pace is
Blow enough: Morinel, a mere mite of
horseflesh, useful and game, and Charlie
Relf, which could scarcely win a fixed
race. In the betting The Bachelor was a
prohibitive choice, and though he once
grew weary when something over a mile
and a quarter was covered, was shaken
up by Martin and won easily ln 4:01.
Morinel finished second, fifteen lengths
ahead of Reif.
The other events decided were not
above the ordinary. Favorites succeeded
ln winning but two purses.
In the opening mile run Owner Stanfleld
scored his second win of the week with
Torlblo. The Apache gliding went to the
post at odds of 6 to 1, with Johnny Relff
up. and in a hard drive downed the fa
vorite, Jennie Reid, a head. The third
choice, Bonnie lone, secured the show.
Most certainly something went wrong in
the steeplechase. Reno, ridden by "Doc"
Tubervllle, was backed down to 7 to 5 fa
voritism, and Our Climate and Vanity
actually went out to beat him. The for
mer's fencing through the field was a
great improvement over his recent efforts,
end Doane landed him a comfortable win
ner, after he had drifted back in the bet
ting to 6 and 8 to 1. The favorite and
Vanity fought it out for the place, the
Judges giving the verdict to the Corrigan
entry in a very close finish.
Fred Foster's flaxen-haired $10,000 beau
ty. Yellow Tail, again performed indiffer
ently In the two-year-old scramble. Kit
ty Kelly opened favorite, but as the filly
ran out in a stake race c ome days pre
vious with Charley Thorpe, it was sup
posed she would do the same with Johnny
Rcift'.'and her odds went back in the bet
ting. Yell Tail, having Jones in the
saddle, was played from twos to even
money favoritism. It turned out an un
wise lection. After racing on nearly
equal terms to the stretch with St. An
thony, the favorite had enough of the
fame, clearly showing the white feather.
Passing the two leaders on the outside,
Kitty Kelly won as she pleased, St. An
thony taking tho place.
The mile selling race bore all the ear
marks of another "shoo-In." The smart
set backed Joe Ullrnan, said to be owned
by Duke & Wishard, and at odds of even
money the gelding won all the way. Op
ponent snatched the place from the mis
erably ridden Cromwell, apparently the
best. !
The mile and a sixteenth handicap at- !
tracted but a field of four to the post.
Caldwell nearly succeeded in leaving For
mero at the post, but Powell soon had him
in front, and in a hard drive the three
year-old led the favorite, Adolph Spreek
els, past the judges a head in 1:48 flat.
Reduced Mrs. Regan's Bail.

"heart disease.
BOME FACTS REGARDING THE RAPID
INCREASE OF HEART TROUBLES.
Do Not Be Alarmed, but Look for
the Cause.
Heart troubles, at least among the
Americans, are certainly increasing, and |
while' this may be largely due to tho ex-
citement and worry of American busi-
ness life it is more often the result of ,
weak stomachs, of poor digestion.
Real organic disease is incurable; but
rot one case in' a hundred of heart
trouble Is organic.
The close relation between heart trouble
end poor digestion is because both organs
are controlled by the same great nerves,
the Sympathetic and Pneumogastric.
In another way also the heart is affect-
ed by the form of poor digestion, which
causes gas and fermentation from half-
digested food. There is a feeling of op-
pression and heaviness 'in the chest,
caused by pressure of the distended stom-
ach on the heart and lungs, interefering
with their action; hence arises palpita-
tion and short breath.
Poor digestion also poisons the blood,
making it thin and watery, which irri-
tates and weakens the heart.
The most sensible treatment for heart
trouble is to improve the digestion and
to Insure the prompt assimilation of food.
This can be done by the regular use
after meals of some safe, pleasant and
effective digestive preparation, like Stu-
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, which may be
found at most drugstores and which con-
tain valuable, harmless digestive elements
in a pleasant, convenient form.
It Is safe to say that the regular per-
sistent use of Stuart's Dyspspsia Tablets
at meal time will cure any form of stom-
ach trouble except cancer of the stomach.
Full sized packages of these tablets sold
by druggists at 50 cents. Little book on
stomach troubles mailed free. Address F.

BOAT FOUND ADRIFT.
| Some Fear That Two Men Who Rented
It Are Drowned.
A Whitehall boat containing a coat and
' vest and a pair of oars was found under
| the wharf at the Union Iron Works yes
: terday afternoon, and investigation dis
j closed the fact that the boat, which is
| owned by John Bonner, a boatman in the
j Potrero, had been rented early in the
j morning to two men.
Bonner says that the men who hired the
! boat from "him were well dressed, and
'â¢ from their appearance he judged them to
ibe Englishmen. They told him they
i wished to row out to visit a ship anchored
i in the bay, and paid him in advance for
' the use o"f the Whitehall.
When Bonner learned that a boat had
i been found adrift at the Union Iron
Works he went over to see it, and Identi
fied it as the one he had rented to the
two Englishmen. Some fear is felt that
the men have been drowned.

HARD COURSING
ON HOUNDS THAT
RAN YESTERDAY
Hares That Surprised
Old Sportsmen.
LARGE CROWD AT INGLESIDE
MAGDALLAH AND IOWA BOY
RAN UNTIL EXHAUSTED.
The Winners Are High Class Dogs
and Will Meet To-Day â
tions for the First Round
of the Stake.
The patrons of coursing who visited the
Ingleside Coursing Park yesterday saw a
grand finish to a day of first-class sport.
lowa Boy and Magdallah were the last
dogs on the 72-dog stake programme, and
they had a run, the effects of which they
will feel in their bones to-day. ;...-
A rattling "long-tail jack" shot from the
box the moment the cover opened, and
went leaping up the field toward the es
cape. Field Steward McHngh, addressing
the slipper, said: .
"There goes a warm baby that should
make it hot for the dogs before the race
is finished."
The veteran coursing man guessed cor
rectly, as the hare sped away from its
pursuers the moment they got within
close range. On to the escape he went,
literally flying over the sward, with Mag
dallah and Flyaway in hot pursuit. Evi
dently thinking he had matters his own
way and feeling disposed to give the dogs
a little grueling, the plains flyer turned
from the place of safety and headed for
the grand stand.
Within full view of the enthusiastic
crowd of sport lovers Mr. Shorttall played
a game of twist and turn on his long-tail
enemies until the dogs, with open mouths
and parched tongues, grew exhausted and
staggered in their futile attempts to
"grass fur." Some interested spectator,
thinking that one or both dogs might
suffer death from exhaustion as the re
sult of too much running, cast a fresh
doc into the field, and the game little hare
made a first-claws run for its liberty be
fore it finally succumbed to the heavy
handicap imposed
The day's coursing was highly enjoyed
by the crowd, and as the best dogs will
meet to-day coursing of very high order
should be the feature. The talent fell
down heavily when Las Palmas won a
flag from Flyaway, a 1 to 5 shot. The last
named dog did not run up to her usual
form although Las Palmas was favored
greatly by the hare during the race, in
which good luck assisted her materially
to run up a Ecore of 18 to 6 at the finish
in her favor. The next cross-counter
which staggered the knowing ones was
when Waterwitch, a comparative out
sider, showed Twin City Girl her tail for
quite a distance of the field. The Girl is
certainly not running as she should, and
doubtless her owners will retire her from
the field until she becomes more thor
oughly acclimated.
The betting on this course was also 5
to 1, with the Witch on the short end.
The dogs that performed exceedlnglv
well yesterday and should give good ac
counts of themselves to-day are Gladia
tor. Moondyne. Mayflower, Lottie M,
Rocket and Susie. The course between
Mystic Maid and Mayflower should bo
wall worth seeing, and the dog that will
capture the flag will not win by many
points.

COURSING AT UNION PARK.
Good Day's Sport With the Running
Dogs and Hares.
There was a light attendance at Union
Coursing Park yesterday, but those pres
ent witnessed a good day's sport. Some
of the courses were unusually hard on the
dogs, especially the one in which Miss
Skyrocket beat Dolly Varden after chas
ing the fleet-footed hare for three and a
half minutes. But for the most part short
courses prevailed, and while some pretty
work was done by the long tails there
were no contests that created any unusual
excitement. The day was taken up with

cou*ah Kennel Club's show at Chicago, he
has won the first prize in the open and

THREE BANKS HAVE
CLOSED THEIR DOORS
SAX LUIS OBISPO, March 11.â i
was expected, when the Commer- !
cial Bank opened for business this j
morning a number of depositors who
had taken alarm at the closing of the j
County Bank yesterday were in wait
ing. As soon as the doors opened the
excited people began clamoring for
their money, and the tellers began
handing it out over the counter as
quickly as expert Angers could 'do it.
In about ten minutes several thousands
of dollars had been paid out, and the
size of the crowd had not diminished, j
On the contrary every moment saw ad
ditions to the people, half frantic with
the thought of losing their savings. One j
or two large depositors obtained their j
coin and took it to the Andrews Bank. j
The bank officials, realizing that a j
dangerous run was on, decided to close i
the doOrs. The depositors were notified j
that the bank would suspend tempo- j
rarily, and would reopen again at the
usual hour on Monday morning. The '
bank is considered sound by conserva- :
tive business men. It is connected with
several banks in other towns. It is
thought that by Monday the bank will ;
be able to reopen.
The Commercial Bank's connections
are the California Mortgage and Say- !
ings Bank, branches in Cambria, San
Miguel, Paso Robles and Guadaloupe in j
this county; one in Santa Maria, Santa
Barbara County; the First National in
Salinas, and the Swiss-American and
Germania Trust Company of San Fran- .
cisco. Of the latter bank Henry Brun
ner, formerly cashier of the Commer
cial, is now the president and repre
sents an immense amount of capital. '
The cashier of the Commercial Bank,
Hazzard Oragg. would not talk for pub- |
lication and referred inquiries to the
president, Hon. McD. R. Venable, who j
says th*- bank was totally unprepared j
for the run this morning. Had the de- â¢
positors made no heavy demand upon ;
it all would have been well. The bank i
had made full preparations to tide over
another season of depression, which
seemed imminent, but anticipated no
such a contingency as the closing of
the County Bank.
The board of directors will meet to
morrow and decide what it is best' to
do â whether to reopen or remain closed .
until they car realize on their re
sources.
The County Bank, which decided to
close its doors last night, is now in the |
hands of the Bank Commissioner, who
will arrive to-morrow evening and un
til he completes his examination and j
issues a statement nothing definite can i
be learned. The statement of the bank's
condition is given by its cashier is as j
follows: Liabilities, capital stock. $150,- '
000; surplus, $100,000; deposits, $348,000;
other indebtedness. $ST,000; real estate, '
overdrafts, bills receivable and other ;
assets, $685,000.
The Andrews Banking Company, of
which J. P. Andrews is president, had '
quite a drain to-day, but nothing like
a steady run. and it is thought this
bank will not be crippled. It was not J
closed until the usual hour, 3 o'clock, j
The remaining bank, the San Luis â¢
Obispo, has in the last few years ma
terially lessened its business. From a
list of deposits of nearly three-quarters j
of a million it has decreased until its !
officers now claim less than $30,000, and I

Bpcflal Cable to The .ill and the New York
Herald Copyrighted, 1899. by James Gor
don Bennett.
PARIS, March 11â M. Deroulede's j
case continues to form the subject of a j
certain amount of discussion. There
appears to be an opinion that the Jure
de la Seine will be called upon to ren
der a decision as to what is the extent
of the fiery patriot's culpability, unless,
indeed, the chamber de mise en accusa
tion should conclude that there is no
reason to carry the matter before the
Assize Court. This was done in the
case of Prince Napoleon on January
15, ISS?,. The Prince was arrested upon
a charge of being concerned in a plot
against the state. He was confined in
an establishment at Auteuil and his
case was sent before the chamber de
mise en accusation, which decided that
although the Prince had openly mani
fested his hostility toward the repub
lic, there was no ground for proceed
ings against him and ordered his im
mediate release.
If this precedent were followed with
regard to M. Deroulede pretty nearly
everybody would be satisfied with the
exception of the prisoner, who is do
ing all he can to blacken his case. A
few days ago Maitre Pasques, Juge
d'lnstruction, who has the affair in
hand, interrupted M. Deroulede in his
deposition with the remark:
"Be careful; you are compromising
terribly H. Marcel Habert, who will
certainly be found guilty and con
demned."
M. Deroulede replied: "He will be
condemned. Very well, his sentence
will be his recompense."
The remark is in M. Deroulede's most
lofty vein, but it might be interesting
to hear what M. Habert thinks about
the matter. Both prisoners have had
a busy week, having been interrogated
almost every day. It is expected the
Inquiry is drawing near its close, and
that Maitre Pasques will send in his re
port within the next fortnight.
As to President Loubet. he seems to
be winning friends rapidly. His simple
tastes are beginning to find admirers.
One of the papers that was among the
very first to depreciate him after his
election reported the other day that an
illustrious foreigner after a visit to the
Elysee said: "I like M. Loubet very
much more than I did M. Felix Faure.
M. Faure put on the airs of a sovereign
which he was not, while M. Loubet has
the air of being a good citizen, which
he ought to be."
The illustrious foreigner can have
been no other than the Prince of "Wales.
It is not likely, however, that the flat
tering appreciation will turn the new
President's head.
It is said the collar of the Golden
Fleece conferred upon M. Faure was
being packed up a few days ago In or
der that it might be sent back to Spain,
as is usual after the death of every
member of the order. Some one said
.to M. Loubet with a smile. "It will
' probably come back for you before very
long."
"I hope not," replied the President,
with a smile. "The opposition papers
would be sure to say that my collar
was in bad taste."

to meet any run upon it. _
PASO ROBLES, March 11.â Bank
of Paso Robles, a private institution,
closed its doors to-day on account of
the collapse of the County Bank of San
Luis Obispo. The Bank of Paso Robles
is the oldest bank in this city, having
been in existence since the founding of
the townâ twelve years ago. It was con
sidered perfectly solvent. The stress
of hard times made it difficult for any
of the banks to carry much available
cash, but they were all considered in a
condition to weather the storm. The
County Bank at San Luis Obispo, which
closed its doors yesterday afternoon, is
reported to have made heavy drafts on
the Bank of Paso Robles. When the
San Luis Obispo concern closed its
doors Cashier F. D. Frost of the Bank
of Paso Robles and President H. Ep
pinger Jr. hurried to San Luis Obispo,
but they were unable to stem the tide.
On their return this morning they closed
the doors of the Bank of Paso Robles
and posted a notice that they had sus
pended business, but would pay dollar
for dollar. It is understood the assets
are amply sufficient, if they can be re
alized upon. Most of the depositors are
confident that the bank will reopen its
doors in a short time.
The Citizens' Bank (an incorporated
bank) of this city, has been doing Its
usual amount of business to-day.
The suspension of the Bank of Paso
Robles will be far reaching in its effects
and may result in many places of busi
ness closing their doors. Quite a num
ber of small depositors may soon be in
actual want if the bank fails to resume
business within a few days. It is re
ported its assets are $75,000, with lia
bilities of about $40,000.
THE LAST STATEMENTS.
Banks' Financial Conditions Accord
ing to the Latest Reports.
The news here that the County Bank
of San Luis Obispo had closed- its doors
was followed by the information that
the Commercial Bank of that city also
was obliged to follow the same course.
This was received yesterday by the
Bank Commission and was in the form
of a brief notification that, the financial
distress of the County Bank had caused
an uneasiness in the minds of the peo
ple, resulting in a run on the Com
mercial which the latter was unable
to withstand. Bank Commissioner Bar
rett and Secretary Dunsmore at once
decided to leave for San Luis Obispo
on the early train this morning to make
an examination of the two banks. The
other two commissioners are in Marys
vilie. About the only information con
cerning these banks is the reports on
file in the commissioners' office.
The last statement of the officers of
the County Bank showing its financial
condition was made on December 31
last It was submitted, duly attested,
by President William L. Beebee, Vice
President P. B. Prefumo and Cashier
J. E. Jack. It showed on that date the
following resources and liabilities and
real estate owned by the bank taken
for debt exclusive of bank premises:

' LONDON, March 11.â Conserva
tive Government has got itself into
financial straits. The publication of
the naval estimates completes the vari
ous items of, national expenditure,
which total up Â£112,185,200, being an In
crease of Â£4,471,200 over the estimates.
It is probable there will be a deficit of
over Â£4,000,000, which, it Is expected,
the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir
Michael Hicks-Beach, will meet by a
reimpositlon of the former tobacco duty
and an increase of the income tax to
9 pence.
The suggestion is made in the press
that the deficit be met by a suspension
of a portion of the sinking fund. The
city, however, is opposed to this as cal
culated to weaken the whole financial
position of the country in a time not
only of peace but of ample revenue and
great prosperity.
A ray of sunshine In the financial sit
uation is seen in the apparently boom
ing state of trade, as shown by the
Board of Trade returns. The imports
since December show an increase of
Â£1,100,000, as compared with 1898, indi
cating that the purchasing power of the
country is still growing. These satis
factory figures help the Chancellor of
the Exchequer in taking a hopeful view
of the review for the coming year, but
they will not avert the necessity of new
taxation.
The Liberal press naturally makes the
most of the Government's financial dif
ficulties, which are attributed to the
Government's policy of "doles to squire
archy and to extravagances."
TO BRING RAIN BY
ARTIFICIAL MEANS
LOS ANGELES, March Rain in
J Southern California would be cheap at
| almost any cost. This is the conclusion
: many business men have reached. The
! questioo of rain-making by artificial
; means was taken up at a meeting of the
Merchants' and Manufacturers' Associa
j tion. A communication was received from
H. Hutchinson, who is said to have suc
ceeded in Indian Territory in producing
rain by artificial means. Hutchinson has
I credentials from the Board of Trade of
I Duncan, I. T., and other responsible
sources. He is said to have been suc
cessful eighteen times out of twenty. The
association believes Hutchinson ought to
! be looked up and his skill given a test. A
! committee, Including E. E. Crandall, Jo
seph Meaner and \V. G. Hutchinson, was
appointed to ascertain as nearly as possi
ble what the cost of the experiment would
be and endeavor to place the association
in communication with the rain-maker.
The following subscriptions were made:
Harper & Reynolds, fifty kegs of powder;
Union Hardware Metal Company, fifty
i kegs of powder; Hamburger Sons, $250.
Many business men promise to give sub
scriptions as soon as it is decided to make
i the experiment.

PLAGUE CLAIMS

Depopulates Towns in
Asiatic Russia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C. March Reports
have reached Singapore giving details of
the outbreak of a horrible plague, which
has carried off hundreds of natives and
almost depopulated villages near Samar
kand. The Singapore Straits Times,
copies of which were received by the
steamer Victoria, which arrived this even
ing from Oriental ports, publishes an ex
traordinary tale of the horror. The paper
gives an interview with a Russian prince
who lately arrived there from the calam
ity-stricken district. It says:
The scene of the outbreak of the plague
was Anzof,' a village about 14,000 feet
above the sea level on a mountain plateau
and so walled in by encircling heights
that travelers can enter only by crawling
over perilous ledges of rock. The popu
lation of the village before the dread dis
ease struck it was 600. More than half of
these are now dead. There were 381 cases
of plague and all saving three proved fa
tal
A party of Russian doctors, hearing of
the outbreak, started to the plague
stricken district. The medical party was
headed by Dr. Lieven, who is well known
throughout the Straits Settlements and
who carried a supply of Hoffkine s pro
phylactic. The work done by the doctors
In Anzof was remarkable. After some
persuasion they managed to get the sur
viving villagers to consent to Inoculation,
and the results showed a signal triumph
for the Hoffkine treatment. No fresh
cases occurred and the last death came
four days after the arrival of Dr. Lieven
and his confreres.
It is believed that the plague was
brought to Anzof by a religious devotee
who had been on a long pilgrimage. He
arrived at the village on a donkey, carry
ing clothes which he said were brought
from the tombs of the saints. It is known
that he had been in Thibet, and, it is
thought, in Afghanistan also. He gave
some of the clothes to an old woman.
The unfortunate woman was smitten with
the plague, which afterward carried off
so many others, and died. Her nurse also
died and seven of her relatives.
The devotee told the populace the
woman's body was not buried in orthodox
fashion and it was exhumed. Everybody
who took part in the disinterment per
ished and the disease then spread rapidly.
The devotee mysteriously disappeared.
The plague was, when the Russian left,
still claiming many victims in the other
villages, but the doctors are making good
headway, and hoped before long to stop
its ravages.
FATHER MORTALLY
WOUNDS HIS SON
Joe E. Bandeni Dying in the Receiv
ing Hospital at San
Jose.
SAX JOSE. March 11.â As a result of a
dispute between father and son, Joe E.
Bandeni. aged 20 years, is in the Receiv
ing Hospital with a bullet in his brain and
death close at hand, and Nick Bandeni,
the father, is nursing one knife wound in
the neck and another in the hand, neither
of which is serious.
The Badenis live in the Willows. The
boy wanted to go up town contrary to his
father's wish. The police believe the fa

WILL INVOKE THE

0 LOS ANGELES, March 11.â Nearly every church and pastor will
0 respond next Wednesday to the call for a day of humiliation, fasting
5 and prayer that has been made by the Methodist ministers of Los An
Â§ geles. The Baptist ministers have taken similar action. The announce
-0 ment of the day of prayer will be made to-morrow from many pulpits.
g The people will be asked to humble themselves in the sight of God and
Â§ ask why he has withheld rain from the thirsting fields of Southern Cal
-0 ifornlaâ why drought exists in the spiritual world. Some ministers ex
? press the belief that the cause of the drought is the rebelliousness of the
Â§ people. Others think God does not visit his children with his wrath;
0 that the dry weather is but the result of natural causes. Whatever the
g opinion entertained by the different ministers, many agree it will do the
Â§* people no harm to devote one day to prayer, to placing themselves in
0 line with the -will of God. Among the appropriate texts for sermons
j~ are the following:

HEAVY LOSS BY
FIRE AT DAWSON
Several Business Places
Destroyed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 11.â Dawson has had
! another disastrous fire, according to Klon
dikers who reached this city to-night di
rectly from the interior. The business part
of the city has been destroyed. In two
hours a half-block was wiped out, and the
loss is believed to be at least 550,000.
The fire occurred on the night of Feb
ruary 13, almost a month ago. The news
; was brought by J. D. Trenholm of the
Dawson Electric Light Company and J. O.
Johnson, a general merchant of Dawson.
They left the interior on February 14.
How the fire started is a mystery.
The business houses burned and their
i losses were as follows: Fish & Co., gen
! eral merchandise, $25,000; Rogers bunk
-1 house, $2500; Dr. Benson, dentist, $20-JU.
Pullman restaurant, $5000; Palmer Bros
grocers, $10,000; Schwartz & Bodleman,
! general merchandise, $5000.
i The fire started in Rogers' bunkhouse
i and in a few minutes it had burned to the
' ground. The flames spread north to blsti
i & Co 's store, which soon was enveloped,
I and then continued south to the other
; buildings, which were dry as tinder and
i took Are with great rapidity. Their can
! vas roofs and seasoned boards were licked
! up by the flames as soon as they were
i touched. -'â., ; ...
The fire department did everything pos
! sible to check the flames and did effective
work in preventing adjoining buildings
; taking fire. The flames were stopped Just
I before reaching Kelly & Co.'s drug store.
During the excitement the owners of
,' many stores removed their goods, thus
', giving thieves a chance to ply their voca
i tion. Hundreds of dollars' worth of goods
\ were carted away, and those not stolen
were trampled upon.
Fish & Co. are San Franciscans.

There is every reason to believe now that the proposed
ordinance prohibiting- bookmaking and pool-selling will be
finally passed to-morrow afternoon by the Board of Super
visors. With this adoption the new measure will become
a law, and the giant evil of the racecourse will be crushed in
this city. Thousands of people >in San Francisco have
worked with the energy of a personal, individual interest
to support and encourage the Supervisors in the position
they have taken. The press, the pulpit, merchants, work
ingmen and representatives of every reputable class in the
community have given the Supervisors words of commen
dation.
A majority of the members of the board declared last
night in authorized interviews that they will vote to-morrow
as they voted last Monday to make the prohibitory meas
ure a law. The members that say they will not do so are
fortunately in a minority. They represent the views of the
gamblers and plead as do the men they represent. The
most strenuous efforts have been made to delay the adoption
of the prohibitory law, to modify its sweeping provisions or
to kill it by a reference to a committee. Professional bribe
givers have been employed, but a majority of the Supervis
ors say now, on the eve of their official action, that nothing
will be able to stop the adoption of this law.
KOBO'B'OBO.HCtBOBOH'OBOBO BOB'
The final vote on the adoption of the
ordinance prohibiting the gigantic evil
of " bookmaking and poolselling in this
city will be taken to-morrow afternoon
by the Board of Supervisors. The action
of the board is awaited with an almost
personal interest by the people of the
city. In passing to print the prohib
itory law the Supervisors earned a
tribute of commendation that has been
freely given. In sustaining with a sec
ond vote their original purpose to re
lieve San Francisco from its gambling
and blackleg invaders the Supervisors
will merit a mead of praise that will be
as general as it will be spontaneous. A
majority of the board wishes the pub
lic to understand that the prohibitory ]
resolution will be adopted to-morrow.
Kvery possible pressure has been
brought to bear upon members of the
.board to induce them to rescind or
modify their original action. The gam
blers exercise a powerful influence, and j
they have not : crupled to use it in the
present emergency. Politicians and pro
fessional bribe-givers have been em
ployed to use tleir dishonorable en
deavors. Conferences have been held to
devise some means through which the
prohibitory legislation could be stopped,
but the acknowledged fact that only a
dishonorable motive can change a vote
has had a deterring influence.
The members of the Board of Super
visors understand clearly the details of
the camnaign that is being made to
make them sacrifice their honor to the
men that have already corrupted so
many of the people of San Francisco.
The gamblers will ask first, on Mon
day, that the prohibitory resolution,
â which has been passed to print, be re
ferred to a committee for further con
sideration. Such a reference means
nothing more or less than the destruc
POSTTTM CEREAL.
"YEOF LITTLE FAITH"
"Let Me Make the Next Cup
for You."
I may be the victim of a fad; if so. it
Is a healthful one. I may be the dupe
of fancy; if so, it is a pleasant one. I
have always rather disdained fads and
disliked figments of the imagination,
but there are a few facts I can make
affidavit to.
From early childhood, I have used
coffee. The taste was no doubt hered-
itary coming from a long line of cof-
fee-loving ancestors who bequeathed
me a complexion to match.
When others spoke of the injurious
effect of coffee. I smiled in a lofty sort
of way and took an extra cup. and
when a friend who is an excellent judge
of the good things of this world left
off coffee and tried Postum. I regarded
her as the victim of a fad and told her
6 Finally my health began to fail, and
I thought perhaps there might be some
truth in the statement that coffee was
at the bottom of it. so I tried leaving
it- off, but the meals were no meals at
all.
That was not imagination, neither
was the headache, morbid listlessness
and general derangement of the sys-
tem. I found my coffee habit was not
to be lightly thrown aside, and became
very much vexed at my own weakness.
"Try my plan," my friend said, and in
my extremity, I finally yielded. She
gave me some Postum. which I boiled
rbout five minutes and sipped it some-
what disdainfully. The color was good
and the fragrance, but the taste waa
flat. When my friend inquired, she
ehook her head and smiled. "Five min-
utes, when I told you fifteen: oh ye of
little faith. Let me make the next
cup for you." She did so. and it was
a revelation.
For a week I continued its use with
great benefit, even the bad taste in my
mouth had disappeared. Humbly I
sought my friend and said: "If you
will tell me where I can get Postum. I
shall continue its use." She smiled
and remarked, "I am afraid you are
the victim of a fad." I took the home
thrust as gracefully as possible, well
enough satisfied to be joked, inasmuch
as I have been so very much helped by
the discontinuance of coffee and the
use of Postum. Delia R. Sheldahl. 1420
Sixth aye., Dcs Moines. la.
tion of the proposed law. The measure
will never come from the committee in
a form that will be practically bene
ficial.
The gamblers will argue that the pro
posed ordinance is too sweeping; that
it destroys a sport which should, on
legitimate lines, be encouraged. The
race track schemers will tell the Board
i of Supervisors that a restriction of the
I racing season will be accepted, and that
| the authorities of the city may limit
j the racing season to sixty days or even
Ito thirty days if necessary. Any sub
stitute will be a welcome alternative to
the proposed ordinance of prohibition.
The gamblers and their paid bribers
will tell the members of the board that
Innocent people, who live upon the race- j
track, will lose their income if book- j
making and convict-making are stopped
in the city. It will be urged that the
racecourse gives a living to many peo
ple and distress will come if the book
making and gambling privileges of the
track are abolished. Restriction and
not abolition will be the plea of the
blacklegs of Ingleside.
Members of the board have already
heard this plea. The argument has been
advanced that certain constituents of
certain Supervisors demand a modifi
cation of the proposed law. The gam
blers are far too crafty to ask anything
more. The indignation of the people
of the city is far too thorough to per
mit now anything else than a remedy
for the evil. The Supervisors know that
j Buckley has been called into a brief
evil existence to aid the gamblers, and
that Sam Rainey has been asked to use
his influence. Members of the Board
of Supervisors know all this and un
derstand perfectly that any plea, made
under no matter what guise of respect
ability, is simply the plea for a dis
credited cause.
Supervisor Perrault stated the situa
tion very clearly yesterday. "We must
destroy gambling on horse races in
this city," he said. "We passed to print
a prohibiting ordinance, and I have
confidence that my associates in the
board will make their resolution a law.
We are on record before the public. We
have already registered our votes, and
any change will mean something I do
not care to discuss. If we determine
to modify the resolution or take any
action less effective than that already
registered I believe that, to complete
the farce and accept our true position,
we ought to hold the session of the
board at Livermore."
Supervisor Perrault's summary of
the situation tells the story of the dis
honest efforts that are being made to
defeat the adoption of the new ordi
nance. While the Supervisors have
been coaxed, cajoled and threatened by
the gamblers the members of the board
have been encouraged and supported
by the hearty indorsement of the de
cent people of the city. Organized labor
has expressed its unqualified approval
of the proposed law, because race
horse gambling and its associated
crimes have worked terrible injury to
men and women who know the value
of money well earned.
The press has praised the Supervisors
for their determined stand because the
people of the press know thoroughly
the devastating influence of the racing
gamblers. Clergymen of every denom
ination are as one voice in praising the
majority members of the board because
j clergymen know the secret tragedies
of wrecked homes, destroyed by the al
| lurements and temptations of Ingleside.
Merchants and business men have bat-
I tied for the victory which the Super
visors have won for the city because
the records of the Morgue and of the
State Penitentiary tell what business
men have suffered in the license of the
gamblers of the race course.
These influences, the best in the city,
are in earnest support of the Super
visors, and to-morrow thousands will
be waiting to know how the vote for
the destruction of a great evil was
taken. In obedience to a public duty
The Call has secured again from every
member of the Board of Supervisors an
expression of opinion on the great ques
tion of the day. In what follows is
given these opinions. It is a matter of
regret that the members of the board
are not a unit, but the reason perhaps
may not be misunderstood.
THE SAN FRANCISCO - CALL, SUNDAY, MARCH 12, 1899.
i
SUPERVISOR LACKM.VNV â am !
not in favor of any compromise or
delay in the settlement of this mat
ter. We have gone into this thing
now nnd we can not afford to back
down. Race tracks are a nuisance :
and a menace to the morals of our
city, and the sooner we curb their
evil influence the better it will be .
for the city. All the members of the !
board are fully conversant with the â¢
matter, and there is absolutely no .
reason why it can not be settled at j
once. I understand that the race
track people are going to request ;
more time, but I do not think the j
majority of the board will grant '
their request. They all know the
evil effects of race track gambling ;
and seem willing to wipe them out. ;
I am only sorry that onr jurisdic
tion does not extend to other conn- j
ties where they have race tracks. I '
would like to see them all abolished.
I have heard the arguments of the \
gamblers and am more familiar
with them than other members on i
the board, and therefore I am not j
ln favor of referring the resolution ;
to a committee or amending it, as
ln my opinion it covers the whole '
ground.
SUPERVISOR PERRAULT I have
little doubt that the resolution in
troduced at the last meeting of the
board will be finally passed at Mon
day's meeting. Every member of the
board knows the evil effects of
gambling at Ingleside, and I believe i
the majority of them are willing to
rectify the evil. I introduced the j
resolution and I Intend to exert
every effort to secure its final pas- ;
sage. Too many of our young men '
and women have fallen nnder Ingle
side's load of temptation. I know '<
that all sorts of political trickery :
will be resorted to by the race track
people to frustrate our attempts to
wipe out the evils of Ingleside, but
I have supreme faith in the majority
of. the board standing by this reso
lution. Ingleside has had its day;
morality will celebrate on Monday.
SUPERVISOR DEASV â I shall vote
for the resolution ns introduced,
and shall do Jill in my power to
close the pool rooms nnd keep them
closed. Since last Monday a number
of good people have called on me
and commended the effort now be- ;
gun to remove the greatest evil
which infests onr city. I sincerely ;
hope the ordinance will became a
law. I have not heard of any effort :
being made by gamblers to stop the
passage of the resolution.
SUPERVISOR BYI.N'GTOX â When
the ordinance was brought np be
fore the board on Monday last, I
voted in favor of passing it to print,
because I deemed that abuses have
grown up under a system which per
mitted pool selling. 1 also deemed j
that the ordinance stood for a re
form which was demanded by the
best citizens of the community.
I am strenuously opposed to it be
ing amended or referred to a com
mittee. The ordinance seems to suit
the great mass of onr people, and
there is no neeessityfor delay, either
by referring it as is contemplated or
by amending. I am not in favor of
such reference or amendment. Hav
ing voted in favor of the ordinance
last Monday, and believing it to be
necessary for the welfare of our
city, I intend voting for its final
passage on Monday next.
If any changes are made after the
stand taken by the board there must
bave been some influence, not for
good, brought to bear upon the
members. As a Supervisor, I stand
to carry out the expressed desire of
the citizens who are for good gov
ernment.
SUPERVISOR HEYER â intend to
vote for the resolution restricting,
or rather prohibiting, gambling on
the race track. Gambling on the
track has wrought enough ruin to
the people of the city, and It is high
time the evil was checked. It has
been apparent to me for months past
that the race track was ruining
many young men. At one time I fa
vored racing. I thought a spring
and fall meeting would encourage
the breeding of blood horses in the
State. After the gamblers began
manipulating things, and after I be
came aware that the track was
working a vast injury to the morals |
...... â  â¢ - â  â  â  . *
! of those who were placed in the way
of its temptations, I became opposed â 
;to it. I am decidedly opposed to j
laying the matter over until another j
date. Delays are dangerous.
SUPERVISOR COLLINS â I am op- !
posed to the nefarious practices of
Ingleside, and I intend to do all in
my power to rectify the evil. My
! vote next Monday will be the same
! as it was on last Monday as far as
1 this matter is concerned. I feel that
i many of our young men and women
I are being mined by the temptations
i of the race track, and I mean to add
i my little mite to save them from
! further ruin and dishonor. I am not
a frequenter of the race track, and ;
I therefore know little of the class
of people who thrive on Its opera
tion. I have read enough in the
â¢ papers, however, to convince me ;
that race track gambling should be
j checked.
SUPERVISOR AIGELTIXGER â I am
' a lover of good and fast horses, but !
'. I think racing has been overdone in
, this city. It has had a tendency to
make business as poor as it is, and
I think It ought to be restricted as
j in other large cities.
One of the reasons why I voted In ;
! favor of the resolution when it was
Introduced was because the men in
control have overdone it. I believe
in passing the ordinance at this
time, and if in future they wish to
hold a race meet we can pass a new ,
law and allow them to have just so
many days racing.
If there is any effort made to tarn
j the matter over to a committee or
! amend or in any way delay Its pas
â  sage, I intend voting against such
an attempt.
We don't want the Ingleside peo-
I ple to think we are prejudiced
against them. They are entitled to |
appear before us and have a hear
ing, but in my opinion it is not the
proper time to do so. The ordinance !
' should pass on Monday, and when :
the matter comes up again before us
they can then give reasons why they |
should be allowed to hold a meet- â¢â 
ing. .
SUPERVISOR HOLLAND â I am op
posed to the methods of gambling
and gamblers now In vogue nt the
' race track and in the pool rooms of
this city. I am in favor of remedy
ing the evils now destroying the â¢
morals of yonug men nnd women.
This cvil â I refer to the race track
gambling â has been increasing, and
particularly the custom of women
and young men and boys being al-
I lowed to bet on the races. In my
i opinion nothing is so demoralising
to society and tends to degrade our
men and -women as this latter fea
ture. The race track people must
; not permit this, whatever else they
| do. I do not want the people of San
Francisco to think I am narrow
minded In this thing. I am in favor
of all legitimate sports which are
conducted in such manner that the
admirers and supporters of true sport
are not debauched or tempted from
the paths of rectitude nad honesty.
I realize and appreciate the fact
that California is famed as the
breeding ground of the world's
greatest horses. This is a source of
pride to all Californians, and the in
dustry should be appreciated and no
obstruction erected which would in
any way have a deterrent effect on
the men who have raised and are
raising the finest horses in the
world. Horse raising is a great in
dustryand should be fostered-for the
good of all mankind, hut the noble
animal should not be used as a.
gambling machine to the extent ii
is in our city at the present time.
Racing should not he entirely pro
hibited, but a limit should be placed
on It. Regarding the resolution now
pending before the Hoard of Super
! visors, I have not given it a great
deal of consideration, but to-mor
row I will vote for what I deem the
best interests of San Francisco.
SUPERVISOR ATTRIDGE Since
voting in favor of the resolution in
troduced by Dr. Perranlt last Mon
day, residents of the outlying dis
tricts have come to me and pointed
ont that if the track ls abolished
they will lose their bread and but
ter. They say that their very exist
ence depends on keeping the track
open, for they have purchased
! homes and land in the vicinity of
! the race track, and if it is closed
i values will diminish.
The resolution, In my opinion, ls
I too sweeping. I would like to see
! some restrictions placed upon rac
ing. I want to give the proposed
ordinance further consideration be
fore voting on It. I think it should
be thoroughly investigated, and I
iam In favor of such a. course. It Is
, probable that representatives of the
track will appear before the, board
on Monday and we will hear some
thing from them. We want to give
' everybody a fair deal and do not
want to injnre any one.
We admit that the race track is
an evil and must be remedied.
SUPERVISOR KALBEX My posi
, tion is a most unfortunate one. I
am by instinct a sporting man, and
: my business brings me in contact
with sporting people. I want to do
the right thing by the people. Many
; of my intimate friends have inter
viewed me on both sides of the pro
position now before the board, and
which has for Its object the suppres
sion of gambling at the race track.
At the present time I am on the
j fence. I regret that I am ln snch an
unfortunate position. My position in
this matter is more delicate thaji
any other member of the board. I
] have not made up my mind how I
will vote on this resolution as yet.

LABOR'S FREE SENTIMENTS.
Representative Men of Every Trade
in Opposition to the Track.
The position of workingmen regarding
the racetrack is clearly defined. They
stand as a unit opposed to it and its no
torious accessories. .
There are two central labor bodies ln
this city, representing the organized
workingmenâ the Building Trades Coun
cil, composed, as its name Implies, of car
j penters, bricklayers, paperhangers,
j painters, plasterers and other men em
! ployed in the erection of buildings, and
I the San Francisco Labor Council, in
which every trade outside the builders'
j is represented, as well as a few Inside.
j As has already been published, the
Building Trades' Council at its meeting
last Thursday night condemned the track
| and supported the Supervisors in their
: efforts to overthrow it.' No definite ac
â â¢ tion was taken, but one member after an
other took the floor and spoke his mind
freely. There was not a man who would
i stand up for the gamblers.
At the meeting of the Labor Council on
Friday night the action was more clearly
! defined. After a free discussion of race
-1 track methods a resolution was adopted
1 instructing the secretary to write a let
ter to the Supervisors indorsing the ac
: tion of last Monday. A fac-slmile of this
letter is printed in another column.
This action of the two bodies, which to
' gether represent over 20,000 workingmen.
is In itself extraordinary. Labor bodies
in this city have hitherto been accustomed
to deal strictly with labor measures.
The fight against the corruption of In
gleside has been so pronounced, however,
| as to demand attention and command vig
orous action from the workingmen of this
, city. The remarks of the labor leaders
: are in themselves significant. P. H. Mc-
Carthy, president of the Building Trades
! Council, says: "There is a trail of blood,
! the blood of young men, leading from
: the Morgue to the gates of Ingleside."
From Walter J. Maearthur of the Coast
I Seamen's Union comes another expres
: sion: "We are all workingmen. Our
i money is well earned, yet for all we know
' our wives and children may be squan
dering our dimes, quarters and dollars on
the track. Many a poor man's home has
i been ruined in this way. Do you want
it to happen to you?" ."._,-.
â  Walter Goff of Carpenters' Lnlon No.
453 calls the attention of his fellow work
; ers to the fact that they are continually
asking favorable legislation, yet they are
slow to show their appreciation of a good
move made outside of field of labor. The
crusade against the united gamblers of
. the track and the managers of local pool
' rooms, he says, is a good one. and it be
hooves all honest workingmen who re-
I spect the sanctity of their homes to take
cognizance of lt. * ;~"y'\._
These are a few arguments against the
I racetrack's notorious adjuncts. The
i members of the labor unions of this city
I can cite instances of the homes of fellow
I workmen ruined by the track. Here a
wife and there a son or daughter has
! fallen victim to the Influence of the
I "bookies," and a broken home circle has
1 been the result. Workingmen want the
evil stamped out. and they promise to
: remember the men who help to stamp it
i out. .

MECHANICS' INSTITUTE.
Old Officers Re-elected at the Annual
Meeting.
The annual meeting of the Mechanics'
Institute was held in the Post street build
ing last night. President Ernst A
Dcnicke presided, and there was a large
attendance of members. After the read
ing of the minutes of the preceding meet
ing the report of the secretary was re
ceived. It showed that during the past
year the total receipts were $46,916 10, and
the total expenditures $45,023 68. The pres
ent membership of the institute is 4295.
During the past year. the gain in volumes
was 1796; total number of volumes 78,391
and total circulation of books 173.425.
The following trustees elected were In
stalled in office: Ernst A. Denicke John
McLaien, Horace Wilson. Charles M.
Plum, Robert W. Neal, Rodney Kendrick
and Walter N. Brunt.
Librarian Frederick J. Teggart, in his
annual report, dwelt strongly on the ne
cessity of more room for the books and of
the spending of more money for the pur
chase of the same.
President Denicke, in his annual report,
advocated the sale of the Mechanics' Pa
vilion block, and the use of the proceeds
of the same for building a new library
building. He stated also that he thought
the time had come for moving the Pa
vilion. _ j . 4 ,
The question of an amendment to do
away with the proportional representa
tion of the minority on the board of trus
tees was lost, after a long discussion. An
other unimportant proposed amendment
! affecting the constitution was also lost.
The board of trustees re-elected the same
officersâ E. C. Denicke. president: Rodney
Kendrick, vice president; E. P. Heald, re
cording secretary, and H. L. Tlcknor,
corresponding secretary. Joseph M. Cum
ming is the business secretary of the in

CORRIGAN MEETS McCARTY.
They Argue as to the Ownership of
Credo.
For a' short time the air in the Palace
Hotel grillroom was so blue with done
brown adjectives last evening that the
chief cook banked his fires and broiled
juicy tenderloin steaks on the artificial
heat so gratuitously furnished. Dan Mc-
Carty of white hat fame and Edward
Corrigan, czar of all Inglesi.le, met in
deadly argument.
Pan made no move to reach for a razor
and Corrigan had no smoke wagon at
tached to his train, but for a while there
was a great deal of bustle and fight talk
in the air. It all came about over the
racehorse Credo.
It seems that some months ago McCar
ty finding the money market a trifle
cramped, borrowed some money of H. S.
Crocker vice president of the Pacific
Coast Jockey Club, to defray the ex
_enÂ«es of bringing some horses to San
Francisco from a Fresno County ranch,
â riving in return a promissory note. Some
time later, in trying out some of his thor
oughbreds, Dan discovered that a geld
lnff by Morello-Prize (breeding enough to
suit the most fastidious), was a preco
cious piece of horseflesh. McCarty con
fided in Corrigan and Corrigan, ever
kind to the needy, agreed to take Credo
and race him in his colors. While sport
ing the green with white sash, the geld
ing won two purses. Once he was beaten
by Wing, and on that occasion it is
claimed by those who ought to know

KNIGHTS AND
LADIES OF
MACCABEES
Gathering From All
Over the State.
TO ELECT REPRESENTATIVES
RECEPTION IN OAKLAND ON
THURSDAY NIGHT.
A Team cf Knights in Rich Robes to
Exemplify the Ritualistic
Work in B'ne B'rith
Hall.
Next Friday there will be a grand
gathering in this city of the Knights
of the Maccabees of the World,
as that day has been chosen by
State Commander S. W. Hall for
a State convention. The previous one
was held here In 1897. On the same day
the Ladies of the Maccabees will hold
their first State assembly, which has been
called by Mrs. Eudocla S. Moffat, deputy
supreme commander for the West and
and State commander for California.
These two organizations by the delegates
will represent eighty tents of the Knights
with a membership in this State of about
4500, and thirty-nine hives of tho Ladies
with a membership of 1500. Dur
ing the past two years the Knights have
Increased their membership in this juris
diction by 2000 and instituted thirty-four
new tents, which is the name used to des
ignate what in other orders are known as
lodges. During that period six lodges con
solidatedâfour in San Francisco, one in
Los Angeles and one in Redwood City.
The largest tents in the State are Los
Angeles No. 2, with 1015 members; Cali
fornia Banner Tent No. 6, with -165. and
San Francisco Tent No. IS, with 297. Cal
ifornia pays the second largest camp tax
ln the entire order in the United States,
Minnesota leading.
The principal business of the approach
ing convention will be the selection of
representatives to the Supreme Tent,
which is to meet in Port Huron, Mich.,
next July. Under a rule of the order the
officers who are to assist the State com
mander during the convention only are
named by that officer at the opening of
the invention. During the session there
will be brought up matters looking to the
advancement of the order In this State
and there will be something done In the
matter of establishing a uniform rank of
the order in this State.
The programme that has been decided
on is as Iollows: On Thursday evening,
the 16th, there will be a public reception
in the Maccabees Hall at Twelfth and
Franklin streets to the delegates to the
convention and to the assembly by th*}
members of Oakland and Argonaut tents
and of Carita and Oakland hives, acting
in unison. A fine programme has been
arranged for the entertainment of the
visitors and their friends who have been
Invited. Two thousand invitations have
been distributed.
On the following day, at 10 o'clock, the
Knights will meet in the Metropolitan
Hall of the B'ne B'rith building, where
the representatives of the different tents
will be addressed by Mayor Phelan, who
has consented to welcome them to this
city. The forenoon session will be taken
up with the presentation of the report of
the State commander and a discussion
thereon. In the afternoon the chief busi
ness will be the selection of representa
tives to the Supreme Tent, and in the
evening there will be an exemplification
of the ritualistic work by the degree team
of San Francisco Tent in its most elab
orate regalia and costumes, which cost
nearly 1800. This team has been rehears
ing for some time, and will have the ex
emplification letter-perfect. This will be
followed by a collation and speeches.

McArthur. The Alameda Boat Club has
appointed a committee, consisting of
President Smith, H. W. Maass and S. J.
Pembroke, to confer with the representa
tives of the South Ends. At a meeting
recently held it was decided to issue a
circular letter to all the rowing clubs on
the bay asking that each club appoint
three delegates who may confer with the
representatives of the other clubs on a
plan to better the condition of oarsmen
on the Pacific Coast. These circulars will
be sent to San Diego. Portland. Seattle,
Tacoma and British Columbia, and the
outcome may be the formation of a West
ern or Pacific Rowing Association, which
shall manage its own affairs independent
ly of the Amateur Athletic Union. It is
suggested that the board of managers of
such an organization should consist of
three delegates from each club, so that
there may be almost a certainty that no
club will be without a representative at
any meeting.
Rowing matters are in an anomalous
condition at present. The Paciflc Asso
ciation is a branch of the Amateur Ath
letic Union and its board of managers
has eighteen or nineteen members (one
from each club), though the constitution
of the A. A. U. says that there shall not
be more than fifteen members on the
boards of affiliated associations. Then
track and field athletics are the important
events In the Eastern States, whereas in
California rowing (over which the A. A.
C. does not claim Jurisdiction) is almost
the only sport which the Pacific Associa
tion attempts to control, the active and
leading members of the board of manag
ers being all representatives of the boat
ing clubs. Another anomaly is found in
the fact that, whereas each of the other
clubs belonging to the association has
only one representative on the board the
Ariel Rowing Club has two, viz.. Presi
dent J. R. Bockman and John I. Nolan.
President Bockman says that J. E. Sulli
van, secretary of the A. A. U., in a re
cent letter recommended that the Paci
fic Association should assume jurisdic
tion over rowing, boxing, etc., on this
coast. President Bockman thinks it ad
vantageous to oarsmen to have a local
body to which they can refer their dif
ficulties without Incurring the delay in
volved In laying matters Before a distant
tribunal in New York. The Pacific Asso
ciation begins the season with one advan
tage, at any rateâ it has money on hand
upon which to draw for the expenses of
regattas or other events.' A new organi
zation would have to create a treasury.
There is a good deal of activity round
the South End boathouse now. After
April 1 the initiation fee to the club will
be raised to $10 and many new members
are coming in. There are now eighty
members and the number is to be limited
to one hundred. The handball court and
the clubhouse have been wired and will
be lighted with incandescent lights.
At its last meeting the Alameda Boat
Club elected the following new members:
J. H. Timmons, Fred Klarman, A. F. Es
tabrook and B. L. Remmel. A committee
was appointed to draw up plans and pre
pare estimates for remodeling the boat
house, work upon which will be begun
very soon.
The Dolphins are very much put out
at the suggestion that there should be
only one interclub regatta during the
season, believing that men do not train
carefully or exert themselves to the ut
most in contests limited to a club's own.

GOOD PROSPECT
TO REORGANIZE
A STATE GUARD
General Dickinson's
Bill Will Pass.
MAY GET EVEN ON OFFICERS
LATEST ITEMS CULLED FROM
SPECIAL ORDERS.
What Is Being Done in the Naval
Militia Marlinspike Seamanship
on the Marion â
Honors.
During the past week the Legislature
did something in the line of putting the
National Guard on an active footing
again. The Senate by a unanimous vote
passed the amended bill for reorganization
that was introduced by Senator Dickin
son, and it went to the Assembly. The
friends of the bill are confident that the
House will pass it as it came fi*>m the
Senate and that the Governor will sign it.
One important amendment is that the bill
shall go Into effect at once instead of at
the expiration of sixty days as/ the
original measure.
The bill introduced by Assemblyman
Chynoweth came back from the Commit
tee on Military Affairs with some slight
amendments and it passed, and is now in
the Senate. This is the measure that was
introduced for the purpose of fixing the
status of the members of the Guard who
enlisted in the Spanish-American war.
There was some talk after it left the As
sembly that it might be amended as to
that section which declares that if the
party who so enlisted wishes to return to
the guard, if an officer he shall serve un
til the expiration of the term of office to
which he was elected or appointed. If the
change is made it will be that officers who
wish to return to their former commands
can do so if elected by the company. This
would give the men a chance to get even
with any of their officers who may have
treated them in a shabby way.
In special orders Issued last week the
resignation of Lieutenaut Junior Grade H.
P. Gray, Naval Militia, is accepted. In
the case of Lieutenant Junior Grade A. E.
"Williams, having absented himself for
more than thirty days without leave, he
was deemed to have resigned, and his
resignation was accepted.
First Lieutenant Ira A. Robie, Second
Infantry, has been appointed a member of
the special examining board to act in con
junction with the examining board of the
Third Brigade in the examination of the
officers-elect in Company C, Second Infan
try, and of the Signal Corps of the Third
Brigade.
Upon his personal application First
Lieutenant C. B. Strong, Troop. B, cav
alry. Third Brigade, has been placed on
the retired list with the rank of first lieu
tenant from June 27, 1888.
There Is considerable activity in the
naval militia at this time, and much is
being done in the way of recruiting the
several divisions to their limit.
On board the Marion Lieutenant Com
mander T. A. Nerney has instituted a sys
tem of drill which includes single stick
exercise and marlinspike seamanship,
which in other words is the science mi
knots and splices. Until further orders
infantry drill will be suspended. The offi
cers' mess on the Marlon last Tuesday
night was attended by all the officers and
a very pleasant evening was spent. Un
der good of the service a number of mat
ters connected with the building up of the
militia were discussed, and it was de
cided to advance that branch of the Na
tional Guard with all the energy the offi
cers can command.
The special service men on board the
Pinta, that is the men who are detailed
by the United States Government as care
takers of vessels loaned to State Govern
ments, had an examination last week at
Mare Island witi* the result . that Cox
swain E. Cotter reshipped, Joseph Hill,
fireman of the first class, retired, Clive
Brown was named to take his place and
Louis Algren, seaman, was named vice
Adolph Groux.
Two members of the Second Division
have made application for appointment
as warrant officers on board of the
Marion, one for the position of gunner
and the other for that of carpenter.
Captain L. H. Turner has applied for
certificate of exemption. Louis and Leon
Slcss and J. Neibaum having been seven
years as honorary members of the Naval
Militia have received certificates of â¢ ex
emption. Louis F. Gerstle has been elect
ed an honorary member of the . Naval
Militia. .> c "i
The medals won at the target were dis
tributed during the week, without cere
mony, to those entitled to receive them.
One of these, a rifle man's medal, went
to Lieutenant Commander Nerney of the
Naval' Militia and a certificate of honor
able mention was given to Major General
Nat T. James, retired.
The appropriation of $5000 for the naval
militia has been divided so that $2000 goes
to the Pinta and the balance to the Ma
rion,
E. M. Dodge and H. B. Dodge, members
of Troop A, have been discharged from
the service on account of removal.
The Signal Corps of the Second Brigade
and the Veteran Signal Corps will cele
brate the anniversary of the institution of
the corps by a banquet on Saturday, the
Ist of April.
Owing to Senatorial duties Major Gen
eral Dickinson, who was in Sacramento
last Friday, was unable to be present at |
the reception on the Chitose, but he was
represented by his aid. Major L., Schmitt, |
who was accompanied by Paymaster i

bowling alley of the most approved type,
with a hardwood floor and .-ill modern im
provements. Though the Encinal Yacht
Club has ceased since the departure of

ALL IN READINESS FOR
THE LEAGUE GAMES
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL WILL
BEGIN THIS MONTH.
The Managers Are Hard at Work Se
curing the Best Material and De
veloping Good Teams.
Plans for a grand opening of the base
ball season are rapidly maturing, and
when the 26th of March reaches this city
the lovers of the national game will be
treated to a bit of the real thing. Many
changes have been put in force in both
the management of the teams and their
discipline. If the plans already adopted
are carried out there will be good ball
played In the California League.
An entirely different management has
charge of affairs since the wind up of last
season, and a new regime has been insti
tuted. Two teams have been eliminated
from the leagueâ the Athletics of this city
and the Stockton aggregation. The league
now consists of six teams. _
In order to foster and preserve a spirit
of rivalry and competition among the dif
ferent clubs, a prize of $1000 will be given
to the team winning the championship.
Tho managers of the respective teams
have been on the gui vive in the selection
of players, who will have to live up to a
system of rigid discipline. They will be
paid a fixed salary and forced to show up
for practice or suffer heavy fines. The
best material developed last season will
be seen this year cavorting on the dia
monds of the league. Borchers, the cap
tain of the San Jose team, has signed
all his men, and they are in pretty good
shape. Santa Cruz has a new battery,
first baseman and two outfielders. Man
ager Ewing of Oakland will have some
new material, which will be tried out in
the initial game between the home team
and the Oaklanders. _â -â¢__,
Catcher Hartman, formerly of Seattle,
will catch for the home team, and Jim
Sullivan, who was behind the. bat for
Oakland last season, will play first base
and act as change catcher. Josh Riley
will return to his old positionâ third base
ânext season, and will be seen with the
Friscos. , , _
Harris is now negotiating with George
Cobb, the old Oakland twirler, and may
secure him. Iberg is on the Frisco re
serve list, but has not yet signed.
The Frisco team will begin active prac
tice this week and continue its work
until the opening game.
The teams will have training quarters in
which they will sleep and dine.

MISS SHEARER
AGAIN LOSES
HOLD ON SENSE
The Poetess Goes Mad
Once More.
WRECKED HER LONELY HOME
HER LOVED CAT KILLED BY
REQUEST.
Flora MacDonaid Shearer Goes Back
to a Livermore Asylum After a
Sensational Episode on
Leavenworth Street.
Miss Flora MacDonaid Shearer is again
in a private Insane asylum as a result of
a sudden and violent return of Insanity,
which a few days ago created consider
able commotion about her lonely home
near North Beach, the destruction and
possible burning of which were prevented
by the timely invasion of some disturbed
neighbors.
This gentle poetess is now a patient
at a private asylum at Livermore. It is
nearly two years since she was found in
the surf about North Beach early one
morning and taken to the Receiving Hos
pital by the police. She was then sent
to a private asylum at San Mateo. A
few days before that she had been found
on Russian Hill, with her two pet cats
she loved, trying to make the cats eat
the beautiful grass.
She was discharged from the San Ma
teo institution, resumed her duties in the
Washington Grammar School, where she
taught for so many years, had another
mental relapse and was sent to the UV
ermore institution. Ââ.ââ,*â 
About nine months ago she returned
to this city as cured. She lived with
friends for a time, and then, about four
months ago, she indulged her own im
pulses by breaking away and going to
live alone ln a flat of her own furnisn
ing at 2038 Leavenworth street. It was
one of three modern fiats, set high on the
hill overlooking the bay, and suited her
poetic temperament and her liking for a
hermit life. Her physician and her
friends protested, but she resolutely
ensconsed herself there, fitting up her
apartments beautifully, doing her own
household work, receiving now and then
Sato from a few chooice friends and tak-
n a !^ especial care of her two loyal pet cats,
SHS whom soon died while tjeimore

Shearer's home above was invaded. Miss
Shetrer was found stark mad, grabbing

wrecked, and the occupant was a mad
woman, but no fire had yet blurted.
Friends were summoned, Dr. BUCKnau
came and soon Miss Shearer was
trapped to a bed and cared for by two
nurses It was a case of "violent hyste
ria" In two or three days she became
comparatively lucid and was then in
formed that she must go to a hospital.
She resigned herself to the fate pre
scribed; but asked that if "Nigger could
not go with her he be chloroformed.
Her beloved cat was gently chloroformed
by friends and reverently buried In a back
yard Miss Shearer. It is said, is likely
to wholly and permanently recover.
Miss Shearer was the daughter of a
Scotch clergyman, and received a classical
education. She is a native of the Isle of
Skye. She has a brothtr and a sister in
Scotland, but no relatives in America. She
Is a direct descendant of the Flora Mac-
Donald of Scottish romance, who rescued
Bonnie Prince Charlie and who is cele
brated in Highland song and story. Her
best poems are contained in the volume
entitled â¢'The Legend of Aulus," and have
been praised by Andrew Lang and other
critics. _______________________
CYCLING SEASON IS
NOW FORMALLY OPENED
CLUB EVENTS SCHEDULED FOR
TO-MORROW.
Olympic Club Wheelmen's New Track
to Be Opened â Citys Go to
Camp Taylor â Races at
San Jose.
The cycling touring season of 1599 will
be opened to-day by the various
clubs, all of which will have country
runs. A large attendance is expected by
every captain, which augurs well for the
sport during the balance of the year.
Perhaps the most important event to
the wheelmen to-day is the opening
of the new track at the Olympic Club
grounds. This track is the one recently
constructed for Indoor racing at the Pa
vilion, is eight laps to the mile, and pro
nounced perfect by the riders. Captain T.
G. Spillane will lead a large run which
will leave the Olympic Club at 10 a, m.
to-morrow with the outdoor grounds as
the objective point. After a short ride
through the park they will make for the
grounds, where some impromptu races
and outdoor sports will be indulged in
under the leadership of George James.
Lieutenants R. H. Schleuter and C. C.
Williams will assist Captain Spillane.
The Bay City Wheelmen will tour to
Camp Taylor to-day under Captain
Menne, taking the 8 o'clock Sausalito boat
and train to San Anselmo. At the club
house an advance list of those intending
to go had fifty-four signatures on it last
night, and with the addition of those who
regularly delay making up their minds to
do anything until the last minute the
number promises to be unusually large.
An excellent dinner ln prospect at the
other end and the short, pleasant coast
down "White's Hill are mainly accounta
ble for the large attendance.
Captain Deacon of the Reliance Wheel
men, Oakland, and Captain Agnew of the
Acme Wheelmen have also arranged
runs for to-day, and altogether the day's
sport is very promising.
The racing men will be cared for to
day in a big meet at San Jose again under
the auspices of the Garden City Wheelmen.
The programme includes a 10-mile lap
race, one mile open, two miles multicy
cle and record trials by McFarland, Ste
vens and Ziegler. It is a good programme
and should draw equally as well as did
last Sunday's.
The Capital City Wheelmen are think
ing of promoting a meet on Sunday, the
19.th, with all the Eastern stars compet
ing. As their board track was burned
down, however, and as the only track left
is a one-mile horse track, the meet would
probably not be very satisfactory.
The annual 25-mile road race of the C.
A. C. C, usually held on Washington's
birthday, has been called off this year,
as most of the racers are in training for
track racing but not for the road. The
relay is the next association event, on
May 7.
The fourteenth anniversary party of the
Bay City Wheelmen, postponed from
February 8. will be held at the Palace
Hotel "Wednesday evening. April 5. The
club's annual minstrel snow will take
place Thursday evening, April 13, at Na
tive Sons' Hall.
The Terminal City Wheelmen of Stock
ton and the Capital City Wheelmen of
Sacramento will hold a 100-mile relay race
tne last Sunday in April from Sacramento
to Stockton and return.
John E. Alexander of the Garden City
Wheelmen of San Jose has gone to To
ronto, Canada, with his wife to live.
The last regular meeting of the C. A.
C. C. bad to be postponed owing to lack
of a quorum.
The Bay City Wheelmen will hold a
five-mile handicap road race at San Le
andro on March 26. â  V,

carry. - â¢ .â¢.;..
There will also be a movement to in
augurate a system of economy in the
management of the affairs of the order,
and there will be a proposition to send
a delegation to the national convention
to ask that body to hold its session in
1900 in San Francisco, that is, providing
that the State convention can offer the
national convention such inducements as
will Insure its meeting here.
Much interest is felt in regard to the
officers who are to be chosen for the next
term. For State councilor, H. M. Bel
linger, the incumbent, is quietly seeking
a renomination. H. G. Squire of San Jose
and F. A. Tibbets are in the field for that
office. The fraternal arrows at this Ume
point toward Tibbets, and the friends of
Squire, if they become convinced that he
has ho show this year, will bring him
out for second position, that of vice coun
cilor. George E. Terry, while he has not
declared that he will be a candidate for
re-election as secretary and has not said
that he will not be, will, in case he de
cides to run, have as opponents Dr. Flood
of Starr King Council and Henry Payne
of Council No. 22 of Oakland. For the
office of treasurer C. N. "Wilson, the in
cumbent, will, if he decides to continue
in that position, receive the unanimous
vote of the delegates. For each of the
minor offices there are half a dozen can
didates. There will be two vacancies on
the board of national representatives, and
for these vacancies those prominently
mentioned are Del B. Bowley, who wishes
to succeed himself, and G. A. Montell of
Alameda.
At a recent caucus of the representa
tives of the San Francisco councils it
was decided to support H. G. Squire for
State councilor and Dr. Flood for vice
councilor.

THE PAN-AMERICAN
GRAND EXPOSITION
CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS TO BE

The State Board of Trade Promises to
Make an Exhibit if Good Space
Can Be Secured.
The promoters of the Pan-American Ex
position which is to be held in the city of
Buffalo, N. 1"., in 1901, are reaching out for
all the support they can secure. It is evi
dently the intention to have every State
in the Union represented by an exhibit of
irs products, as shown ivy the following
telegram received yesterday by the Cali
fornia State Board of Trade:
"We earnestly ank your assistance toward se
curing the passage of a resolution through your
Legislature enabling your State to erect a
building and make an exhibit at the Pan-Amer
ican Exposition, to be held near Buffalo, on
the Niagara frontier, in 1901. The Federal Gov
ernment has appropriated $:OG,OCO, our State

cretion of your Governor. Further particulars

This dispatch is signed by Conrad
Diehl the Mayor of Buffalo, and chair
man of the board of directors of the expo
sition, and by the editors of all the daily
and commercial newspapers of that city,
Manager J. A. Filcher of the State Board
of Trade considered the matter of suffi

that took place it was shown that it is I
too near the end of the session of tha i
Legislature to entertain. any. idea of get
ting help from that source, bo the mem
bers must look to private enterprise to
carry through the project of making an
exhibit in Buffalo. it is believed that suf
ficient material can be secured, aside from !
that to be sent to the Pari.-- Exposition, to
make a fine display of California products
at the Pan-American Exposition. The
first thing to do is to learn the cost of i
carrying out the scheme and especially
of the floor and exhibit space. Mr. Filcher
was directed to communicate with the I
managers of the Buffalo fair and learn
something of the amount of room and the
cost thereof. If the amount required is
not too high the State Board is more than
likely to undertake to place a flne ex
hibit in the exposition.
TAKING AN INTEREST.
A Number of Donations That Have
Been Made to the Native Daugh
ters' Home.
That there is an interest awakened in
the new home for the Native Daughters
that was opened on the tirst of the year
is manifest by the number of donations
that have recently been made to it. Within
the past month the following contribu
tic.is have been received: Laurel Parlor

from Mrs. J. G\ Spicks of Buena Vista
Parlor.
The entertainment that was given last
Wednesday at the home in aid of the
library netted . eighty-five choice bound
books, and it ie stated that others will be
added to that number. That being done
the home will soon have a good library
of select reading. '.Hi-
Last Friday, night the ladies and gen

Giovanni Bornia, a Window-Cleaner, j
Receives Probably Fatal
-â  Injuries.
Giovanni Bornia, a window-cleaner, was
probably fatally injured yesterday after
noon by falling out of a three-story win
dow at Jackson and Buchanan streets. He
was cleaning the window and overbal
anced.himself, falling a distance of about
forty feet. He was taken to the Receiv
ing Hospital, where Dr. Thompson found i
that both of his knee caps and both fore
arms were fractured. His head was also
injured and it was thought that his
skull was fractured. He was sent to the 1
City and County Hospital.
Bornia lives at 112. Montgomery street.
He came here two or three years ago, I
and when he got settled down sent for his ]
wife and child, who arrived a year ago
last August from Italy. A week ago last I
Friday his wife gave birth to a baby, but :
it died and was buried last Sunday. His
wife is sick in bed and it is feared that \
when she learns about his accident it will j
kill her. _â¢_ ,;',y

The case of James H. McClernon,
charged by his father, Daniel, with forg

terday. It was shown that at the time
of the alleged forgery, four years ago,
the. father could not write, as one of the
fingers of his hand was injured, and he
requested his son to get the Interest on
the deposit and sign his name. The
young man's marriage against his father's
wishes is the cause of the old man's en

PERMANENT DOCK
SECURED FOR
TRANSPORTS
Folsom-Street Wharf
Given Them.
EVERYBODY IS NOW SATISFIED
CONEMAUGH AND HER MULES
SAIL FOR MANILA.
School Teachers Visit the lowa.
Sneak-Thieves Rob the ship
Bohemia â Death of Cap
tain Burns.
The Alaska Packers' Association and
th Alaska Commercial Company are to
move to Fremont street when it is ready
for them, and the Government is to have
the use of Folsom street wharf for the
loading and unloading* of its transports.
This understanding was reached last
Tuesday evening and was published ex
clusively by The Call on Wednesday
morning. Plans and specifications for the
erection of a shed over Fremont street
wharf have been prepared by Chief En
gineer Howard Holmes of the Harbor
Commission, and by the time the Govern
ment requires Folsom street the other
wharf will be ready for the Alaska Pack
ers' Association and the Alaska Commer
cial Company.
The Government is in no Immediate need
of a wharf nor will it be until its own
transports are in full operation. At pres
ent the Zealandia is at the Oceanic dock,
and while she continues in the Govern
ment service she will be handled from
that wharf. The City of Puebla is at the
Broadway wharf and the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company will continue to han
dle her from that* point. The Newport left
Manila for San Francisco via Nagasaki
last Friday, and on her arrival she will
go to the Mail dock. The St. Paul sailed
for Cebu on February 28, and the Indiana
and Pennsylvania are in port at Manila,
so that for nearly two months to come
Uncle Sam is in no great hurry for a
wharf.
The Arizona will be the first of tho
transports that will make Folsom street
wharf her regular berth. She left Ma
nila on the 9th inst. for Hongkong. At
the latter place she will be overhauled be
fore coming on to San Francisco. She will
be followed by the Scandla, Grant, Mo
hawk. Mobile, Scindia and two or three
others that will be used exclusively as
transports between San Francisco and the
Philippines. As soon as these vessels are
in proper working order all the other
transports now under charter will be re
leased.
The freight now awaiting shipment will
probably begin moving this week. Nego
tiations are now pending for the charter
of the steamers Charles Nelson, Cleve
land, Elihu Thomson and Wyefleld. while
the sailing vessel Marion Chilcott has al
ready been secured. The City of Puebla
and Zealandia will be ready in a week or
ten days, but they will carry troops, as
will probably the Charles Nelson. They
Will also carry considerable freight, and
in all probability, in conjunction with the
other steamers named, will take awaj
the 7000 tons of stores for the soldiers now
on hand. All the vessels named have their
regular berths, at which they will load if
chartered. â¢>â¢-. â¢.-;''- â â  .-' â  r .' r 'y-~
The Conemaugh got away for Manila
with her load of mules, yesterday. She
took away 300 of the animals and thirty
teamsters went along to look after them.
Dr. Walsh, veterinary surgeon, and three
hospital stewards went along. Captain
Bromehead does not expect to have any
trouble with the mules and says he will
land the 300 in better condition in Manila
than when they left San Francisco.
All the school teachers in San Francisco
visited the battleship lowa yesterday.
Several of the battleship's launches were
in service, but it took nearly two hours
to carry all the teachers who were desir
ous of inspecting the man-of-war. In fact,
it was so late when some of them got
aboard that they only had just time to
take a hurried glance around and then go
ashore again. y
Sneak thieves did a pretty clever piece
of work down at Main street yesterday.
The ship Bohemia is to be recoppered and
a gang of men was at work last Friday
stripping off the old copper to make room
for the new. Some of the sheets were left
lying on the wharf while others were
hanging from the hull, half on and half
off. Yesterday morning they were all off.
The thieves had secured them and put
them in a place which the Harbor Police
are vainly trying to locate.
Chief Steward O. N. Clark of the steam
er Alameda tells a good story on two of
the vessel's firemen. "While the steamer
was lying in Sydney harbor 'Pat' and
â¢Mike/that's not their names but they'll
do, fell in love with the same girl," said
Clark yesterday, when telling the story.
"The night before we sailed for San
Francisco the men determined to find out
which of them had won the maiden's
heart. In order to do so they arranged
for a call upon the young lady.
" 'But.' says Mike, a thought striking
him, 'how am I to know you've been there
and gone again?' _Â,_,
" 'Faith, yes,' says Pat. and how am I
to know you've been there and gone
again?' ' ,' "'â "-"._
"The two men were in a quandary for
a while and finally Mike settled it this
wav 'If I get there flrst, Pat. when I
come out I'll make a ring around the
lamppost with a piece of chalk, and if
you get there first you rub the ring out
when you come out' < yy,
"The arrangements worked like a charm
and now both firemen are engaged to the
maiden fair."
Captain J. p. Burns, owner of the
schooner Vine." died at his home in Ala
meda yesterday morning. He was only ail
ing a short time, as he was on 'Change
last Thursday.
James Clancv and George Sweetman
were locked up by the Harbor Police on a
charge of stealing scrap iron from a junk
yard yesterday. Officer Dillon thinks they
know something about the copper stolen
from the ship Bohemia.

Mr. Bail Must Explain.
R. Bail, a saloon-keeper on Powell
street, near Ellis, was arrested yesterday:
afternoon on a warrant charging him
with misdemeanor embezzlement. The
complaining witness is Hugh Morris, a
messenger employed in the quartermas
ter's department at the Presidio. He al
leges that he borrowed $1 50 from Bail on
a pawn ticket for a watch worth $40. On
Friday morning Morris offered Bail the
$1 50 and asked for the pawn ticket. Bail
said he had mislaid the ticket, but Mor
ris found from the pawnbroker that the
ticket had been presented by Bail's son
and the watch redeemed.
SCATENA HELD FOR MURDER.
The Morgue Officials Deny That the
Dead Man's Coat Was Muti
lated by Them.
. When the case of Daniel Scatena,
charged with the murder of his partner,
S. Brancoli, in their fruit 'store on Lar
kin street, was called before Judge Gra
ham yesterday Scatena's attorneys said
they had decided upon not offering any
evidence. The Judge thereupon held Sca
tena to answer before the Superior Court
on a charge of murder, without bail.
With reference to the allegation that
the lining of- the coat of S. Brancoli had
been cut with a scissors in such a way
as to mutilate the bullet holes and remove
the powder burns. Janitor "Tom" Smith
of the Morgue said yesterday afternoon
that the coat was delivered to the police
with the bullet holes untouched last Fri
day at noon. He had slit up the right
sleeve to get the coat off the corpse, but
he- was very careful not to interfere with
or mutilate the bullet holes in any way.
Detectives Wren and McMahon are in
vestigating the matter. When the coat
was submitted in court Friday the lining
where the bullet entering the back had
passed through was clipped with scissors,
removing all trace of the hole and pow

DEATH OF CYCLER PECK.
Was the Pacific Coast Champion and
Well Known Here.
Frank G. Peck of Yuba City, who was
burned to death at Marysvilie Friday
night in the big fire there, was well
known to local wheelmen, having been a
member of the Bay City Club for ., the
past two years.
Peck's best performance on the road
was made on May 8 of last year in the an
nual relay race. As a member of the Bay
City team he rode the fifth relay of ten
miles in 25 minutes flat, the fastest time
made over any ten-mile stretch in the
race. His next nearest competitor was
half a minute slower. Peck won the
championship of the Paciflc Coast,
against amateurs and professionals, at
the meet of the Capital City Wheelmen
at Sacramento on July 4 last.
Recently Peck wanted to come to San
Francisco from his Yuba home, and asked
the Bay City Wheelmen to pay his ex
penses. As this was an infringement of
the amateur rule, the club refused to be
a party to it. and Peck then sought aid
from the Olympic Club, who also turned
him down. The Bay Citys heard of it
too, and asked for his resignation, which
was received and accepted by the club
two weeks ago.
PRISONERS AT BAR.
A Quartet of Burglars Sentenced â Si-
monsen Gets Twelve Years.
Four convicts were sentenced to various
terms in prison yesterday. Charles Silders,
convicted of burglary in the flrst degree
for having feloniously entered the store
of Dillon & Co., 310 California street, was
sentenced to five years in San Quentin.
Jules Simonsen. the opera singer and
"porch climber," who was caught loot
the residence of A. R. Heyman, 623 Eddy,
and who subsequently pleaded guilty to a
charge of burglary. was sent to Folsom
for a term of twelve years. This sentence
was imposed by Judge Dunne and took
the prisoner's breath away. Simonsen ex
pected a short sentence for the reason
that he pleaded guilty.
Henry Wiebold, who pleaded guilty to a
charge of burglary, was sentenced to one
year in San Quentin. Myer Jacobs, con
victed on a charge of burglary in the flrst
degree for having looted the house of w.
G. Crandall. 1301 Gough street, was sen
tenced to rive years in San Quentin.
The "Dark Secret" Arrested.
Joseph Reid, better known as the "Dark
Secret," was arrested yesterday morning
by Detective Dinan and Policemen Sylves
ter and Joy and booked at the City Pris
on on a charge of grand larceny. About
a week ago he met John Baumgardener,
a stranger, and became so friendly with
him that they spent the night in Baum
gardener's room at 12 Mason street, j Reid
attempted to put "knockout drops in
Baumgardener's liquor, but failed. When
Baumgardener was asleep he stole $300
out of his pocket and disappeared..

Sure Rupture Cure.
â â
Wonderful Restoration Re-
ported From Boston,
Mass.
GEO. F. MULFORD CURED AFTER
SUFFERING EIGHTEEN
YEARS.
Despite the claim*- so frequently made that a
surgical operation la necessary to core rupture,
the case of George F. Mulford of Boston, Mass.,
who resides at 484 East Fifth street iB pointed
out as a direct refutation of the surgery be-
lief. Mr. Mulford was ruptured for eighteen
years and tried everything known almost, but
failed to even derive benefit. His rupture was
such that trusses did not hold him and for this
reason the surgery Idea was presented to him
as the last resort. A final effort was made by
the comparatively new method Invented by
Dr. W. B. Rice of Adams, N. V., well known
as a rupture cure specialist, and in two weeks
after treatment began Mr. Mulford was prac-
tically a cured man without having suffered
pain, operation, detention from work or suffer-
ing of any kind.
GEO. F. MULFORD.
The important feature of the Rice invention
is the fact that it holds any kind of a rupture,
no matter how severe it may be, and ls worn
with so much ease and comfort night and day
that a person scarcely realizes he is wearing
it The case of Mr. Mulford Is somewhat
Identical with that of George Bell of St.
Charles. Minn., reported cured by the same
method of treatment. It is a wonderfully
brilliant Invention, I*" sold at a marvelously
low price and is the greatest blessing ever
devised for those who have suffered with rup-
ture and erroneously believe there is no cure
outside of the knife.
Readers should send for Dr. Rice's Illus-
trated book on the cure of rupture and mall
it to anyone they know to be ruptured. Such
an act of kindness will be worth a great deal
to those who suffer with this great affliction.

MAD, MERCILESS MARCH
t
What it Means to Millions of Consump-
tives and the Countless Army
of Lung Sufferers.
NOW IS THE TIME TO FORTIFY YOURSELF
Catarrh, Bronchitis, Grip, or Its After- Effects, Asthma-
Weak System, Lingering Cough, and AH Other
Consumptive Tendencies Should be Looked
After Carefully at Just This Time.
What March Means.
What the frost is to the flower is
March, mad, merciless March, to the
consumptive. March is a month
fraught with fearful possibilities and
countless dangers. March is the month
when those of consumptive tendencies
should be ever on their guard, ever on
the alert to combat the inroads of pul-
monary diseases.
March is the time when every cold,
yes, every symptom of a cold, should
be fought off as gallantly and cour-
ageously as only those under the glori-
ous Stars and Stripes know how to
fight off conditions, new or old, remote
or near at hand.
March is the time to look after the
"little things in health." for many a
consumptive's grave has been filled by
one who neglected a simple cold, and
realized the truth only when consump-
tion's wicked grasp was upon him.
Fortify Yourself.
Now; not to-morrow, or the day after,
but to-dayâ NOWâ the time to fortify
yourself against the ravages of possible
disease in the month 'to come.
Remember that even the healthiest
and most vigorous person in the world
comes out of the month of March
weaker and less vigorous than at the
beginning. Then what must it mean
to the millions of lung sufferers who
haven't the vitality to fight the ele-
ments?
It means one thing to DEATH!
Don't be one of those who take
chances. Fortify yourself against the
battles of wind and weather which will
be fought relentlessly against you for
weeks â long, weary, wicked weeks.
Stock your constitution with a fighting
array of strength that will overcome
any condition of climate or weather.
Make of yourself an invincible fortress
of health, a veritable Gibraltar of
strength.
If you are well and strong and hearty
now," do- this as an extra precaution;
but if you are in any way a lung suf-
ferer, if you have catarrh, asthma,
bronchitis, grip or its after effects, any
kind of a cough, shortness of breath, a
hereditary consumptive history, occa-
sional chest pains, rough breathing,
"morning and evening" coughing spells,

poor circulation, pimply skin, night
sweats or any other symptom that
shows a consumptive tendency, don't
hesitate for a moment, but fortify your-
self at once, not as a precaution, but
as needed and necessary safeguard
against grave possibilities.
The Way.
Never in the history of the world be-
fore has mankind been so singularly
fortunate in having at its disposal a
means to the end of fortification as to-
day. Heretofore there have been many
different ways to fortify yourself at a
given point, each good in its way, but
nothing that could cover ALL condi-
tions, nothing that would meet EVERY
requirement, until the eminent Ameri-
can medical scientist. Doctor Slocum,
gave to the world the benefit of years
of scientific study and research and
promulgated what has since been
named in his honor the SLOCUM SYS-
TEM.
In the SLOCUM SYSTEM, which con-
sists of four distinctly different prep-
arations, a carefully thought out and
scientifically constructed system of
treatment is given. It touches not
on one point, but on ALL the points
necessary to completely fortify the hu-
man system against the inroads of
disease and the dangers of climatic
changes so potently powerful in March.
FIRST, the SLOCUM SYSTEM
seizes on every germ in the nose,
throat, chest or lungs, and after killing
them drives them completely out of
the system, thereby removing the cause
of the disease.
SECOJfO, it Introduces into the
weakened and debilitated system a
strengthening, invigorating and fatten-
ing food, which builds up and restores
the wasted and worn-out tissues and
covers the body with a blanket of flesh,
which defies the cold and piercing winds
and properly protects the delicate res-
piratory organs.
THIRO, it soothes and allays all
inflammation of the alimentary cahal,
due to the former activity of the germs,
now removed, stops all catarrhal dis-
charges and conquers the cough. .* y ' :
FOURTH, it sends all over the
system a tonic influence, which stimu-
lates, invigorates, strengthens and

â  ion and brings the rich hue of youth to
I the cheeks. It vitalizes every weak and
"rundown" condition, quickens the
brain and regulates the heart, till the
whole system responds with a warm,
natural glow of perfect health. It brings
back the degree of health which Nature
intended should be yours, and fortifies
1 invincibly by making perfect.
So much for the SLOCUM SYSTEM.
| Now for the manner of obtaining it.
Practical Philanthropy.
Much as the SLOCUM SYSTEM
j means to humanity, great as its bene-
fits are to lung sufferers and those in
quest of fortifying strength, it may be
obtained by the readers of the The Call
for the asking, owing to the desire of
Dr. Slocum that the world may partic-
ipate in his glorious discovery and that
humanity may beneflt and reap the
reward of his long years of labor.
A special arrangement has been made
with Dr. Slocum by which the readers
of The Call may have the four prep-
arations making up the SLOCUM SYS-

! and complete addresses to the SLOCUM
i LABORATORIES, 96 and 98 Pine street.

I have recently been indorsed by Sir
William Broadbent, physician to the
Prince of Wales.
Write to the Doctor To-Day.
No matter what your difficulty, no
matter what your condition, no mat-
ter what your fears, write to Doctor

the idea that you are addressing a
man with a big. broad, liberal mind,
who has given the best part of his life
! to the study of just such a case as
I yours, and who will give you advice as
: freely and generously as he offers his
! famous SYSTEM OF TREATMENT.
Don't delay, don't put off till to-mor-
row, but write immediately to Dr. T.

Our plan is to sell you a home for the same \
monthly payments that you now waste in
re-nt. Yes. waste. You are constantly paying j
out and nothing to show for it. Why don' 'â 
you pay the same tent money on a newly
built, modern home of your own and be in- i
dependent of slaving for the landlord? Go
out to the Heyman Tract and look at those
3 cottages lust built. Take Mission-st. cars,
' transfer to Twenty-second st., which will
bring you direct* to the tract. Ask there for
Mr. James A. Cotter, our builder, who will
show- you the cottages.

LEGAL NOTICES.
NOTICE Of Testamentary Beauests.â The late
JAMES WEIR, of Saint Clouds, Blackrock, in
runty Of Dublin. Esquire, by his will dated
12th of October, 1893, bequeathed the follow-
ing legacies, amongst others, namely: One
Thousand Pounds to Mrs. Rachel Sandiland;
One Thousand Pounds to the children of the
late Andrew Brown: One Thousand Pounds to
each of the seven children of Testator's wife's
sister, Isabella Fallow, namely, James Fal-
low. William Fallow, John Fallow. Gavin
Fallow, Janet Fallow, Mary Fallow and Ag-
nes Fallow; One Thousand Pounds to Mrs.
Grace Barr. formerly Steele; One Thousand
Pounds ln equal shares amongst the children
of John Steele, son of Mary Steele; One
Thousand Pounds to the Issue living at the
death of the Testator of James Weir, who
died in his lifetime; One Thousand Pounds
to each of the six children of Testator's
brother, Thomas Weir, deceased, namely.
James Weir. Francis Weir, Andrew Weir.
Agnes Weir, Elizabeth Weir and Margaret
Weir. _ ,
The Testator recited that some of the per-
sons who might be entitled to legacies under
his will were, the Testator believed, resilient
ln America. Australia and New Zealand, and
it contained the following clause: "I hereby
declare that every person entitled to a legacy
under this my will, shall within a period of
three years from the day of my death, send
ln to my trustee or trustees a claim (in writ-
ing) for such legacy, and any person who
shall not send in such claims, as aforesaid,
shall absolutely forfeit all benefit which he or
she -lit have otherwise claimed under this
mv will, and the legacy hereinbefore be-
queathed to him or her shall be dealt with
as a lapsed legacy." And the Testator di-
rected his trustees, as soon as conveniently
might be after his death, to cause advertise-
ments to be inserted in newspapers, requir-
ing ail persons entitled to legacies to send In
their claims.
The Testator died 30th of October. IS9S, and
said wiil and one codicil were, on the istii
November, 1898, duly proved by Sir William
Fin- Hat. r. Robert Bell, James Anderson
Merry, the executors and trustees thereof.
Now, all such of above-named legatees
as have not already, done so, and all
other (if any) persons claiming to be
legatees or to be beneficially entitled
under the said will and codicil, are
hereby required to send In to - the
said executors and trustees, at the office of
the undersigned solicitors, claims (in writ-
ing) end the necessary proofs of identifica-
tion, and the trustees will, at the expiration
of a period of three years after the death,
finally wind up the estate and distribute the
then "remaining assets of the testator with-
out reference to any claims, except those
which shall have been sent in within said
period. The executors have collected and
realized a very large proportion of the Tes-
tator's assets, and they have paid the Testa-
tor's debts, and thus will shortly be in a po-
sition to pay the above-mentioned legacies,
and to distribute their Testator's estate (ex-
cept of course, such part of the residuary
property as it may be necessary to retain for
three years).
The executors believe that they already pos-
sess the addresses of the above-named lega-
tees, but for extra precaution, and in pur-
suance of their Testator's directions, publish
this advertisement, and particularly request
each named or indicated legatee to send ln
a formal written claim without further delay.
Dated at Dublin this 11th day of February,
1899.

FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK. March 11.â Financier says:
The loan and deposit expansion which has been
a marked characteristic of the New York bank
statement since the opening of December has
seemingly culminated. The exhibit for the
week ending March 11 shows a falling off of
$3,062,000 ln loans and $8,155,100 in deposits, a
change in the latter Item being due in part to
the loss of $413,900 in cash which the banks re-
port. The decrease In reserve was only $1,375,-
-125, the excess now standing at 8-4,678,325. It
Ib doubtful lf the averages tell the whole story'
of the week's operations. The material de-
crease In reserves for the several weeks pre-
vious has had the effect of bringing a great
deal of cash to New York in the hope of
profitable employment, and the total amount
does not figure in the current statement. On
the other hand the movement to the Interior has
been lighter than usual. The most Important
factor of the week appears only In part in the
statement. Central Pacific payments March 10
called for a transfer of no less than $6,000,000 in
cash from the banks to the Sub-Treasury, but
In the weekly averages this counted for only
one day, or nominally one-sixth. The money-
has gone out of the banks, however, and may
Influence rates for a few days next week. To !
what extent this will will prove true depends
largely upon the volume of Interior money
which will be forwarded to this center.
The statement, so far as current operations
are concerned, ls rather confusing. It Is to be
noted that while the actual cash in banks de-
clined $3.500,000â and one bank's loss more than
accounts for thisâ the excess reduction Is only
one-third of a million. The deposit changes,
which reduced reserve requirements by over
$2,000,000, explain this showing. The loan con-
traction probably reflects the consummation of
several special operations and the liquidation
of speculative accounts. It is also not im-
possible that it indicates a thorough absorp-
tion of the large volume of American securi-
ties returned from Europe and in a lesser de-
gree the contraction In foreign credits. Re-
garded as a whole the statement is favorable.
In that It forecasts continued ease In money.
WEEKLY BANK STATEMENT.
NEW YORK, March 11.â The weekly bank
statement shows the following changes: Sur-
plus reserve, decrease, $1,375,125; loans, decrease
$3,802,000; specie, decrease, $2,207,000; legai
tenders, decrease, $1,206,000; deposits, decrease
$8,115,100; circulation, decrease $26,000
The banks now hold $23,203,000 ln excess of the
legal requirements.

FATAL WRECK ON
THE BURLINGTON
Collision Occurs in a
Blinding Storm.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LINCOLN, Nebr., March 11.â A blind
ing storm of snow and rain was the
cause of a bad collision on the Burling
ton road two miles west of Lincoln at 6
o'clock this evening, resulting in the
death of three trainmen and the in
juring of four others. The dead:
LUKE BOYCE, engineer.
ELMER GRAHAM, fireman.
JOHN DOYLE, engineer.
The seriously injured: Daniel Dela
ney, engineer, cut on head and legs
fractured; August Skans, fireman, leg
broken, L. L. Emerson, fireman, inter
nally injured; Arthur Goodwin, brake
man, hip dislocated.
The collision was between a switch
engine in charge of Luke Boyce and i
eastbound fast freight No. 46, a dou- j
ble header. Engineer Boyce was mak- !
ing his way to West Lincoln with three
empty box cars. The fast freight com- j
ing toward him was late and he had no
warning until it loomed up in the j
storm directly in front. He had barely (
time to reverse the lever when the en
gines met. The shock threw his engine j
back, pinning him against the tender,
crushing him fearfully. His engine, '
which remained on the track, ran wild
to the yards, where it crashed into and
demolished a freight car. Boyce was
alive when taken out, but died soon
afterward. -X
The shock of the first collision derail
ed the second engine of the fast freight.
Engineer Doyle and Fireman Graham
went down in the wreck and were kill
ed instantly. The head engine held to
the track but was badly wrecked.
The dead and Injured, all of whom
live in Lincoln, were brought to the
city. The injured, it is thought, will
recover.

MARYSVILLE'S LOSS IN
LIFE AND PROPERTY
MARYSVIDLE, March 11.â loss
to the insurance companies by the fire
which consumed the Marysvilie Woolen
Mills last night will reach $71,400. The
woolen mill company carried a total
insurance of $75,000. The detached
buildings, which were covered to the
amount of $3600, were saved. The total
loss, it is now thought, will be in ex
cess of $150,000, and may reach $200,000.
Seventy-five persons were employed in
the mills at the time of the fire, and
when the mills were running to their
full capacity double the number were
at work.
The directors will meet in a few days
to confirm the settlement with the in
surance companies and at that time
will consider the re-establishing of the
mills. Their determination will be
largely influenced by N. D. Rideout,
managing director of the London and
San Francisco Bank, who probably is
the heaviest stockholder in the enter
prise. Fifteen thousand dollars of the
stock is held by D. E. Knight of this
city, who has been manager for many
years.
The Marysvilie Woolen Mills began
operations in October. 1867, and have
run almost continuously since that
time. Incorporated originally for $50,
--000, the capital stock was increased
from time to time until it stands at
present at $200,000, of which sum $75,
--461 45 represents cash put into the en
terprise and $124,538 35 stock dividends
declared to the shareholders from time
to time. In addition to these stock div
idends the mill always has paid a lib
eral annual cash dividend, ranging in
recent years from 6 to 8 per cent.
The remains of Frank Peck, who was
overcome by the smoke and burned to
death during the conflagration, were
recovered this morning. Peck was a
son of ex-County Surveyor W. F. Peck

MRS. CHILDS WILL
WED JOE WHEELER
Engaged to the Hero of
Two Wars.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 11.â A Philadel
phia special to the Herald says: Phila
delphia has been rarely stirred as it
was stirred to-day by the report from
Washington that the widow of George
W. Childs was to marry General Joseph
Wheeler. Although there is much to
confirm the report, many are inclined
to doubt its authenticity. The story
from Washington said:
"Upon the announcement of the re
tirement of General Joseph Wheeler
from the volunteer service of the army
comes a much more surprising and in
teresting piece of news. It is nothing
less than an authentic statement that
Mrs. George W. Childs, widow of the
former publisher of the Philadelphia
Ledger, has promised her hand to Gen
eral Wheeler. The contracting parties,
lt is reported, had arranged to make a
public announcement of their engage
ment immediately after Easter Sun
day, by which time the hero of two
wars will have been mustered out of
the volunteer service' of the United
States.
"So much interest is attached to the
movements of General Wheeler through
the efforts made to declare his seat in
Congress vacant in consequence of his
holding a commission in the army that
it has been found impossible to keep
in secrecy the attachment existing be
tween Mrs. Childs and himself. Gen
eral Wheeler has been paying marked
attention to Mrs. Clara Childs ever
since his return from the Spanish-
American war in Cuba, where he won
additional laurels for his braVery and
unfailing cheerfulness during the crit
ical days before the assault upon San
Juan."
Mrs. Childs has been visiting this city
the last week, a guest of Mr. and Mrs.
J. Thompson Spencer. She left for her
Washington home at 5 o'clock this af
ternoon, having changed her mind re
garding her proposed visit to New
York. Mr. Spencer was seen to-night,
however, and asked about the reported
engagement.
"Mrs. Childs left for Washington late
this afternoon," he said. "No formal
announcement of the engagement was
made by her, consequently I can nei
ther affirm nor deny it. During her
stay here she discussed General Wheel
er repeatedly, and I know that she
thinks a great deal of him."
George C. Thomas, while he had no
positive assurance regarding the truth
of the dispatch, nevertheless said he
believed it to be true.
One of Mrs. Childs' most intimate
friends told me to-night that he felt
sure of the truth of the report. ' \ .
"While I think the announcement of
the coming marriage is somewhat pre
mature," he said, "it is, nevertheless,
a fact. Among the select few the en
gagement has been known for several
days. Mrs. Childs did not announce it
generally, but it was understood that
the marriage would take place shortly
after Easter. Mrs. Childs appeared to
be very fond of talking about General
Wheeler, whom she admires very much.
You can unhesitatingly state that the
engagement is a fact."
The Tabernacle Society.
At a ladles' meeting at Notre Dame
Convent, Dolores street, Friday afternoon,
the Tabernacle Society was organized and
new officers elected as follows: Sister J.
Theresa, general manager; Mrs. Goodell,
president; Mrs. Bannerman and K.
Lawler. assistant to the president; Miss
Bannerman, secretary: Mrs. Flanagan,
treasurer. It was decided to begin active
work. The Tabernacle Society was or
ganized years ago with a view to supply
such articles as are needed on th*- altar
in the â  way of linen and similar cloths.
All such necessary articles have been free
gifts, and they were donated by these
generous ladies to churches needing such
supplies. The ladies meet once a week at
the convent as a sewing society and prop
erly prepare all these things. Their time
is a free gift, and membership in the so
ciety amounts to but little during the
year. Those who desire to join or assist
the good work should communicate with
the secretary at Notre Dame Convent.
THE LATE FRANK PECK-
of Sutter County and was in his nine
teenth year. He graduated last year
from the Marysvilie High School and
was one of the most popular men in
the class. He held the amateur mile
bicycle championship of the Paciflc
Coast, and was a member of the Bay
City Club and other organizations.
MAGGOTS WITH
BEEF FOR TROOPS
Meat Carted in Filthy
Wagons.
Special Dispatch to The
CHICAGO, March 11. â Lieutenant
Colonel H. B. Sharpe testified at the
beef inquiry to-day that wagons which
had not been cleaned after being used
for the transportation of manure and
wagons in which garbage had been"car
ried, the bottoms of which were cov
ered with slime in which maggots were
crawling, were -used to carry fresh
meat to the soldiers at Camp Thomas,
Chickamauga, last summer.
Lieutenant Colonel Sharpe was sta
tioned at Chickamauga from April 23
to July 20 of last year and was later
chief commissary with General Brooke
in Porto Rico. The blame for this con
dition of things, said Lieutenant Colonel
Sharpe, lies on the shoulders of the
commissaries, who sent their wagons
for their meat without having properly
cleaned them according to orders.
As soon as he learnC-d of the matter
he ordered the wagons cleaned imme
diately. The meat issued to the troops,
the witness said, was of good quality
and in good condition, but after it had
been carried in wagons in the condi
tion described it was, of course, impos

following facts: Mrs. C. B. Barden. of
No. 77 Pleasant avenue, San Jose, says:
"Something over a year ago I flrst
noticed a small bunch in my left breast,
which grew rapidly larger and gave me
much pain, not only in the spot af-
fected, but in the left arm and side.
The pain was so severe and constant
that I was unable to get my customary
sleep. I worried night and day, and
finally consulted a specialist, a Dr.
Bangs of San Jose, who, upon making
an examination, said it was a tumor
(the bunch was then as large as a
hen's egg) and he said if it was not
removed at once lt would turn into a
cancer. The time was set for the oper-
ation to be performed, on February 21,
1599. I wrote my husband, who was
then in San Francisco, treating with
Dr. Truth for rheumatism, to come
home at once to be with me while I
had the tumor cut out. He hurried
home on the next train and insisted
that I first try treatments with Dr.
Truth. He said he would not possibly
do me harm, and if I was not cured
could then be operated upon. I went
to see the Healer at once, and after the
first treatment the pain left me, and
after twelve treatments the bunch had
entirely disappeared. I cannot say
enough in praise of Dr. Truth's treat-
ments, and am convinced that, if the
operation had been performed I would
always have been sorry, while I am
now delighted and cured."

PROSPECTS OF A TEST CASE
STOLEN POOL TICKETS THAT
FAILED TO WIN.
Knotty Point as to Whether There Is
Value in a Ticket Where the
Horse Does Not
Show Up.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â  90S Brodway, March 11.
A knotty point in law was raised in the
habeas corpus proceedings for the release
of Paul Kay in Judge Hall's court to-day.
Kay is charged with grand larceny for
having -stolen two pool tickets for the
races at Emeryville last January from J.
J- Wall, a capitalist from the northern
part of the State. It was stated at the
t.me that Kay stood close by Wall when
the latter purchased the tickets from the
bookmaker on the horse Medium. Short
i> alter *H all had placed the tickets in his
pocket they were purloined by Kay. The
alleged thief was caught immediately and
Placed oehind prison bars. In the mean
time the horses were off. and Medium
CTi-fi t ?,. :ila * ie a showing. The tickets
ne.a by Wall therefore were of no value.
At the preliminary hearing Deputy Dis
trict Attorney Samuels contended that the
intent had been shown, and that if the
r.orse had won the tickets would have
been presented for payment and promptly
cashed. Kay was accordingly held to an
swer before the Superior Court on a
charge of grand larceny, and to-day his
petition for a writ of habeas corpus" was
argued before Judge Hall.
Kay's attorneys. Sawyer & Bennett, ar
gued that their client was being wrong
fully held, since it had been .shown that
the stolen tickets were without value.
In response. Deputy District Attorney
George Samuels contended that the code
does not require a specification of value
wherethe offense charged is that of steal
ing from the person. The writ was ac
cordingly .denied, and Kay reman*: to
the custody of the Sheriff. He was given
one week In which to plead.
Kay's.; attorneys, however, have decided
to take the matter up to the Supreme
Court next Monday.

OAKLAND. March 11.â Four weeks ago
when the City Council granted permis

called showcase windows in his new store
on Washington street, between Thirteenth

as to how the public would regard the
departure. To-night all doubt was set
a: rvs'y and the thousands of people who
wÂ«rre on the street inspected the hand

A HUMAN HAND
FOUND IN THE
GARBAGE WORKS
Rudely Chopped With
a Dull Ax.
FROM A MEDICAL STUDENT
CORONER HILL DETERMINED
TO STOP THE PRACTICE.
_
Detective Egan Detailed to Ascertain
the Identity of the Miscreant
Who Is Perpetrating These
. Outrages.
Another mutilated portion of a human
I body was found yesterday on the garbage
; pile of the Sanitary Reduction "Works.
It was the left hand of a laboring man
I and had been chopped off at the wrist
close to the lower joint of the thumb
, with a very dull hatchet or similar in
strument. It had been in a pickling vat
j for some days, and was as hard as a piece
| of wood, and this fact leads to the belief
' that it came from a dissecting-room.
The peculiarity of the thing is that the
\ hand had not been dissected. It was sim
! ply chopped off, whether before or after
i it had been pickled it is impossible to say.
, The fragment was taken to the Morgue,
; from which place it will be buried by the
! City Undertaker at an expense to the
i city of $S 90.
Coroner Hill declares that he will put
a stop to this annoying practice of hair
brained or no-brained medical students
disposing of human fragments in garbage
barrels. The serious feature of the case
Is that it is impossible for the police au
thorities to determine whether or not the
fragments are those of the corpse of a
murdered person or simply of a dissect
ing-room subject obtained ip a legitimate
way. The Coroner yesterday addressed the
following note to the Health Officer:
"Dr. A. P. O'Brien. Health Officerâ Dear
Sir: I suppose you have seen by the pa
pers that numerous portions of bodies
have been found at the garbage cremat
ory within the past few weeks. I am en
deavoring to find out where they come
from, in order that the pernicious prac
tice of throwing human .remains in the
garbage may be stopped. I trust that
I shall have your assistance in this mat
ter, and would like to confer with you as
to some means of stopping it."
The police authorities have determined
to discover the offender, and with that
end in view have detailed Detective Egan
on the case.
BERKELEY TO HAVE
A JUSTICE COURT
Governor Gage Approves a Measure
Which Gives the Town Its
Own Legal Machinery.
BERKELEY, March 11.â For over a
year the university town has been with
out a court, and during that time muni
cipal ordinances have been a dead letter.
The days of this state of things are now
numbered. In a very short time Berkeley
will have the satisfaction of seeing law
administered, within its own corporate
limits and of knowing that the measures
passed by the Board of Trustees can be
enforced^ by the effective means of legal
machinery.
A telegram was received from Sacra
mento to-day saying that Governor Gage
had approved a bill granting to towns of
10,000 to 15.000 inhabitants the right to
establish a Justice Court. It is the Gov
ernor's signature to the bill which gives
the promise of the new order of things.
The news of Us having received executive
approval created quite an excitement here
and it has been the topic of discussion to
day throughout the city.
The effort to secure this much-needed
legislation was undertaken by the Board
of Trustees at the opening of the present
Legislature. A previous attempt to bring
about the desired end by voting upon a
charter amendment at a special municipal
election had signally failed. As the need
of a court grew dally more pressing, the
only wav out of the difficulty lay in an
appeal to Sacramento. The appeal was
accordingly made, and not without result.
Senator E. K. Taylor of Alameda intro
duced the measure into the Senate. It
was received with favor both there and in
the lower house, and to-day became law.
Berkeley watched its progress not with
out considerable anxiety, and Interested
residents have been at the capital for the
past two months endeavoring to further
its course. Now that their work is over
the 'university town deems that it has
sufficient cause to congratulate itself.
When seen to-day. Town Attorney
Brewton A. Hayne. who has labored m
defatigably for the measure, said that it
would be a mere matter of time before
the machinery of a court would be set up.
He expected that after some preliminary
details had been looked after the County
Supervisors would appoint a Justice of
the Peace and thus bring the city once
more to the position where it could en
force law within its limits.
ANOTHER SECRET MARRIAGE.
An Oakland Couple Who Also Sought
Seclusion in San Rafael Last
February.
OAKLAND, March 11.â The facts of an
other secret wedding leaked out to-day,
and the contracting parties are both pop
ular young people in local society circles.
Melville Tobrlner and Miss Catherine
Louise Mcintosh have been husband and
wife since February 13 last. On that date
they went unostentatiously to San Rafael,
where the nuptial knot was tied, and not
until to-day was the happy news broken
to their many friends. ,_,... ...
The bride is a niece of District Attor
ney Allen, and the groom is employed
with his brother in the vocation of drug
gist at Seventh and Market streets.
The mother of the bride had requested
that the marriage be postponed until the
coming summer, but when she learned
that the event had already taken place,
contrary to her wishes, she forgave her
daughter and a happy reconciliation was
effected. * _
To Discuss Expansion.
OAKLAND. March 11.â What promises
to be an interesting debate, particularly
at this time, has been arranged between
Rev Dr. Coyle and Colonel John P. Irish
on the nation's policy of expansion. This
event will take place in the lecture room
of the First Congregational Church next
Thursday night, and will be specially for
the Men's League of some of the churches.
It is* proposed further to arrange another
debate on the same subject with Dr. Coy.c
and General W. H. L. Barnes on one side
arid Colonel Irish and President Jordan
of Stanford on the other. The date for
this latter event is yet undecided.

DIES IN A PRISON,
THOUGH INNOCENT
Sad Story of a Riocon Indian
Incarcerated in Sao
QueQtiQ.
SAN QUENTIN, March 11.â "Pete Bill" -was an Indian, and a convict at
that. For over a year he has been an inmate of the penitentiary. Last
Thursday a fellow prisoner confessed that "Pete" was innocent of the crime
of murder, and in a few days, perhaps, the Indian would have been set at lib
erty, but death stepped in and liberated the prisoner before justice could
be done by any human agency. . â¢
In Frank de Pue's barn two grief-stricken parents knelt to-day and in
their native tongue wailed their sorrow over the loss of their only son. They
were "Captain Bill," chief of the Rincons, and his squaw. Their first visit to
the prison was when their boy was consigned to serve twelve years inside
its walls for the killing of a Napa Indian named Bill Nando: their second
was when they came and took their boy home a corpse.
Visitors heard the wailing and moaning to-day and were attracted to the
barn. It was only an Indian and his wife they saw, but they all removed
their hats and moved softly about. "Pete Bill" lay in the ugly black coffin
made at the prison. Under it was a piece of carpeting and at each end a
candle in a jar. "Captain Bill" and his squaw knelt near the remains.
"My boy he tell me." whispered the aged chief, "that he no kill Bill
Nando. Mariano done it. He say, 'Papa, some day everybody know it the
truth.' Now they know it, but my boy no can come back to me."
'Tete Bill," together with the Mariano mentioned, was sentenced to twelve
years for the murder of Nando. Mariano now admits that he struck the blow.
But "Pete" is dead. This evening he was taken to the rancheria near Clo
verdale. By tribal custom there will be mourning over his grave for eight
days. His vindication came too late.
SHIELDS MAKES
A FUTILE PLEA
A Vindication Meaning
Nothing.
THE GUARD'S PITEOUS APPEAL
WHY WARDEN HALE IS IN AN
AWKWARD POSITION.
Captain Edgar Becomes Opportunely
111, While "Stool Pigeon" Cooper
Is Sent to the Dungeon
as a Schemer.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
* SAN QUENTIN PRISON, March 11.â
Guard J. F. Shields asked for a morsel of
food and received a stone. The man who
was discharged from San Quentin prison
with a dark blot upon his escutcheon be
cause a crafty felon had accused him of
sinning had the courage to violate prece
dent by appearing before the Board of
State Prison Directors yesterday and ask
ing for an invesitgation. He made no re
quest for reinstatement; he uttered no
recriminations. His simple request was
that he be accorded an invesitgation.
With him came several witnesses whom
he expected to disprove the allegations
made by a convict "stool pigeon.*' In. a
straightforward, manly way he" told the
board that all he desired was to vindicate
himself of the charges that he had been
a party to the carrying of arms and
ammunition to prisoners and to smug
gling opium into the penitentiary.
"Gentlemen," he said, "1 am a married
man and have little children who prattle
about my knee and call me father. I do
not wish these little ones to grow up and
have it hurled into their faces that their
father connived at a terrible crime. If
this black stain is not washed off my
name that is what will happen. Besides,
it is hard for a dishonored man to obtain
work, and in order to provide food, cloth
ing and the common comforts of lite for
my family, work I must have. Bring
this man Cooper forward; hear his story,
hear mine and the proof I have to back
it up. Then judge between us.
Just live minutes were required for
Shields to understand that he snould have
had an attorney present, that he was to
be vindicated in a manner that left his
case the same as before. Director \V ilk
ins didn't like the work that was done,
but he had to stand it.
"Gentlemen," said Warden Hale. I
wish to say that what Mr. Shields has
asserted is unqualifiedly false. I have not
charged him with smuggling arms into
the prison, and told him I would not take
a convict's word. I discharged him be
cause after this occurrence 1 found that
he was not a good man to keep."
Director Devlin took up the written re
quest for an investigation and read it to
tne board. Then he* informed Shields that
as the Warden denied the making of such
a charge and refused to make one the
petition for an investigation was unneces
sary Director Wllkins said the Warden
had 'a perfect right to employ and dis
charge men as he saw lit, and that in
such matters the board had no jurisdic
tion- but ln his opinion the desire of the
guard for a chance to clear his name was
reasonable.
"Yes " passionately retorted Shields,
"but the Warden has said 1 smuggled
opium into the prison. I want that in
vestigated. I was up before him a month
ago on that charge." ;
"That is true," yelled Hale, "and if
necessary 1 can prove it by Captain Bir
lem, Guard Alden and by convicts. '
"Then prove it," hotly demanded
Shields. You say tnat I smuggled opium
into this prison a month ago and that you
knew it If you knew it why did you keep
me employed for thirty days after you
had proof I Was concerned in a crime?'
This was a body blow for which the
Warden had no guard. He hesitated, and
finally intimated that he might give his
reasons later. Devlin here came to the
rescue and said no request was made for
an Investigation of the opium story in the
written petition and it could not be con
sidered As for the other charge, the
Warden declined to accuse Shields of
having smuggled arms into the institu
tion, and therefore it was "ridiculous
to ask for an Investigation on that score.
At this Hale again grew excited, declaring
that when Cooper said he had twice given
Shields money he connected it with the
opium charge, and thought it time to
discharge the guardâ this after asseverat
ing that he put no faith in what the con
vict had related to him.
The incident was then closed by Direct
ors Fitzgerald, Hayes and Ray arranging
themselves on Devlin's side. Shields had
to take his bitter pill in silence, and left
the room. After the session was con
cluded Fitzgerald admitted that Shields
came the most highly recommended of
any guard In the prison and that there
was no doubt he had the sympathy of all
the prison attaches. He also was willing
to admit that nearly all the proof against
him rests on the word of a convict.
There were other peculiar happenings
at the meeting of the board. The case of
the eight convicts charged with a con
spiracy to escape was laid over until the
April meeting on account of the alleged
opportune sickness of Captain Edgar.
Taken In conjunction with the fact that
the board will appoint a new Warden at
the same meeting, this is considered sig
nificant It is well known that Hale and
Edgar are intensely Jealous of each oth
er and have been since the strike of two
years ago, and there are not a few at
San Quentin, and, for that matter, else
where who scoff at the tale of conspiracy
and express their belief that for campaign
material the tale of Cooper is a "good
thine" and deserves to be "shoved along.'
Even the Warden tacitly admitted yes
terday that Cunning Cooper had handed
him a large-sized gold brick by affirming
his Intention to place Cooper in the dun
geon and leave him there until the next
meeting of the Prison Board. For a. man
who is no Mason and yet confers thirty
third decrees of that order on his fellow
prisoner! or Jl 50 a head this will be a
hard fate. Cooper had some of the in
mates so enthusiastic over his fake Ma
sonry that they made squares and com
passes out of babbitt metal and -wore
them around with pride.
At the morning session of the board
plans were adopted for an incorrigible
ward to be built on the second story of
the old factory building. The plan in
cludes thirty cells, which probably will be
built of steel at a cost of $1700. Another
estimate is for cells of wood and iron at a
cost of ?SOO. The work will not begin until
the directors so order at their April ses
sion.
It has been feared for some time that
the jute mill would have to be closed on
account of drought and the consequent
small supply demanded by farmers, but
the board decided that action at this time
would be premature. If better conditions
prevail at the time of the next session it
may not be necessary to close the mill.
Prisoners who had broken rules of dis
cipline were brought before the board and
punished by being deprived of credits as
follows: Joseph Baker, serving three years
for grand larceny, sixty days' credits for
assaulting an inmate with a knife; Isi
dore Boldivia, twenty years for robbery,
six months' .credits for running away
from a guard; William Phelan, five years
for burglary, three months' credits for
resisting a guard; James Anderson, seven
years for burglary, one year's credits for
making preparations for escape.
J. B. Sparks, doing five years for a
burglary committed in San Bernardino
County, had three months' credits re
stored for good behavior. The man is
blind in one eye and fast becoming blind
in the other. He will leave the prison on
May 1. 'William P. Mardon, serving three
years for stealing a calf in Butte County,
was paroled.
The case of Baker stirred Director Dev
lin to frame a rule that after April 1 no
prisoner shall have any knife in his pos
session except as a tool. The Warden
said the convicts could not be kept from
putting points on knives, and received the
reply that that was what a Warden was
for. If he could not maintain discipline
somebody else should be permitted to try
it. The rule was unanimously adopted.
The report of the Warden on grain bags
and raw jute was as follows:
Number of grain bags on hand, 4,720,000; held
for shipment on order of last year, 835,000; sold
since January 1, 1599, 403,500; Bold awaiting or
ders for shipment, 1,216,600; on hand available
for sale, 3,503, raw jute on hand, 2223 bales,
will run until May 3!. 1899; contracted for to
arrive, 7000 bales, . 3500 on board the British
ship Dunstattnage, out from Calcutta 66 days,
and 3500 ori board the British ship Agnes Os

CONTESTS THE WILL OF
HER LATE HUSBAND
Mary Bollinger Declares the Decedent
.Was Unduly Influenced by
;":.;.; His Son.
SAN JOSE. March 11.â The contest of
the will of Christian Bollinger, begun by
his young widow, Mary A. L. Bollinger,
was given additional interest to-day by
the filing of a suit against George Y. Bol
linger, individually and as administrator
of the estate of Christian Bollinger, to
prevent his transferring or _in_any__way
disposing of any property. y- J
Christian Bollinger died a year ago at an
advanced age. In his will, made a couple
of years before his demise, he estimated
his wealth at $91,000, but an inventory
made after his death revealed only $3000
worth of property. Mary A. Bollinger,
his second wife, at once began a contest.
She alleged that Christian Bollinger was
of unsound mind and weak and his son
George had obtained nearly all his prop
erty by undue influence.
â¢ In the suit filed to-day Miss Bollinger,
through her attorney, alleges that her
husband transferred property to George
Bollinger in trust for his .heirs. She
claims it is all community property and
that she Is entitled to one-half. She asks
for this amount and says the defendant
refuses to return it to the heirs. Judge

CLAIMS AGAINST HOWARD.
Union Savings Bank Brings Suit to
Recover.
SAN JOSE, March 11.â The Union Sav

Nicholas Bowden, filed a bill of claims
aggregating $290,000 with Commissioner of
Bankruptcy W. A. Coulter in the E. A.
Howard bankruptcy estate. The amount
covers twenty-eight claims, with interest,
which the bank held against Howard, in
cluding the $226,000 which had been wiped
out by the agreement with H. Ward
Wright, then president of the institution.

EFFECTS A COMPROMISE
WITH HOBSON'S HEIRS
SAN JOSE, March 11.â Abram King,
the banker, who, as guardian, was ac
cused of having stolen $22,000 from the es
tate of Stephen Hobson, an incompe
tent, has effected a compromise with the
heirs of the estate.
For twenty years' King was Hobson's
guardian and handled property valued at
$10,000. Mrs. Louise Kruse, Hobson's only
daughter, finally ousted King from con
trol. It was then charged that King had
been systematically robbing his ward for
years. Bills had been raised and fraudu
lent charges made and money misappro
priated. The peculations were alleged to
have amounted to $22,000. The matter was
taken into court and a civil suit for $13,500
is now pending against King. This will
be dismissed. It is said the compromise
was secured by King paying $10,000 to the
estate.
The" Grand Jury returned six indict
ments for forgery and one for embezzle
ment against King. These come up for
trial on Monday morning before Judge
Lorigan. '..y'y-.

GIGANTIC GOLD MINING
SCHEME INAUGURATED
San Francisco Capital Secures a
Proposition the Rothschilds
Sought to Obtain.
Vast Gravel Deposit in Tuolumne County to
Be Worked for Precious Metal-Plan
Involves the Construction of a Great
Tunnelâ Sanguine Promoters.
ONE of the biggest schemes to ex
tract gold from the mountains of
California was inaugurated at con
ferences of mining men and pro
moters held in this city Thursday
and Friday. The project is of such
magnitude and the prospects considered
co good that the Rothschilds -sought to
obtain control and' would have succeeded
had not local capitalists made a more
advantageous offer to the originators of
the scheme. An exhaustive investigation
has been made of the properties offered
and the men who have taken* hold of the
project will expend hundreds of thou
sands of dollars in opening up the mine.
Of course they expect to receive magni
ficent returns on the investment and if
the hopes of those interested are even
partially realized millions upon millions of
the yellow metal will be obtained and
California may once more lead in the
production of gold. A number of capi
talists have been anxious to get in the
scheme, but it was so quietly worked
by a few Sonora men that only a limit
ed number succeeded in becoming mem
bers of the corporation recently organ
ized. There is unlimited money behind
the project, however, and it is now an
nounced that development work will be
gin immediately.
The proposed scheme is to open up the
great gravel deposit near Columbia, six
miles from Sonora, in Tuolumne County.
After the experts and engineers decide on
plans for the opening up of the mine an
immense tunnel ls to be driven from the
Stanislaus River to Shaw's Flat and
Springfield Flat. This tunnel will be
nearly a mile in length and will be built
to drain the gravel sink, which com
prises between 600 and 700 acres. In early
days this section was extensively mined,
both by drifting and hydraulicking, and
many millions of dollars in free gold was
taken from the gravel. After the top de
posit of gravel was removed the miners
reached a lava crust and a sort of bowl
der bedrock, which prevented further
operations under the systems then in
vogue and, while it was known to the
miners and mineralogists that a greater
deposit of gold-bearing gravel was be
neath this crust, the mines were practi
cally abandoned. Those familiar with the
conditions realized that an immense out
lay would be necessary to properly de
velop the mines and make them profit
able, and as the requisite capital was not
at hand or the moneyed men were chary
of tackling so great a scheme the gold
has remained hidden in the gravel for
many years. Now, however, an effort
is to be made to wrest this hidden wealth
from the earth by a company composed
of a few daring speculators and miners.
For the past two years a score of men
prominently identified with the mining in
terests of Tuolumne County have been
working up the scheme, which is now
rapidly coming to a focus. They knew
that capital would be easily obtained to
work the gravel flats in that section if the
matter could be properly placed before
investors. About one and a half years
ago the Columbia Tunnel and Exploration
Company was incorporated under the
laws of West Virginia. The Incorporators
numbered only twenty-five men, and the
articles of Incorporation contained a pro
vision that no assessments could be levied.
This was done to protect the originators
from a "freeze out" if the stock was
placed on sale. Among the charter mem
bers of the company were P.. A. Ogden,
James McCormack, W. D. Bannister,
Charles Johnson and a number of other
Sonora men. P. N. Lilienthal, president
of the Anglo-Callfornlan Bank; James
Miller, the mining promoter; Banker
Goldberg and several other San Francisco
men were interested, and thought the
scheme meritorious, and they went into
it. P. N. Lilienthal was elected president
and James Miller secretary of the com
pany.
The Tuolumne men then went to work
and quietly secured, by purchase or bond,
the claims to all the land which the com
pany desired to include in the vast mine.
They met with no opposition, and when

Columbia Company went to the owner

Three Years* Suffering.
The Itching and burning I suffered in my
feet and limbs for three years were terrible.
At night they were worse and would keep me
awake a greater part of the night. I consulted
doctor after doctor, as 1 was traveling on the
road most of my time, also one of our city doc-
tors. None of â¢ the doctors knew what the
trouble was. I got a lot of the different sam-
ples of the medicines I had been using. I found
them of so many different kinds that I con-
cluded I would have to go to a Cincinnati hos-
pital before I would get relief. I had been fre-
quently urged t.i try CUTICURA REMEDIES,
but I had no faith In them. My wife finally
prevailed upon me to try them. Presto . What
a change. I am now cured, and it is a per-
manent cure. I feel like kicking some doctor or
myself for suffering three years when I could
have used CUTICURA remedies.

1 or Shaw Flat section he found no diffi
culty in securing the title or bond. No
one not in the scheme had any knowledge
of the proposed project and none sus
pected what was going on. Had the plan
been talked about the projectors would
have been unable to secure all the claims.
The owners would have been too anxious
to retain possession and go into the com
pany. After all the claims were secured
the cat was let out of the bag. Then the
men who had parted with their holdings
regretted their haste in unloading what
they considered property of doubtful
value.
Unknown to residents of Tuolumne,
noted experts had visited the section and
made reports to the new company. They
estimated that the gravel deposit was
probably fifteen to twenty feet in depth
and that the ground was fairly rich. Ex
perience in gravel mining has taught that
where the ground is rich on top there is
more gold at the bottom. Appreciating
this fact, the promoters became very san
guine and formulated a plan to conduct
an extensive and comprehensive plan to
prospect the field before deciding on the
best method to work the ground. It was
determined to purchase a boring machine
and sink holes in every section of the
flats, and the results obtained would indi
cate where to begin work and at what
point the drainage tunnel would have to
be built.
Before commencing the tunnel it was of
course necessary to find the bedrock. The
boring machine would find this, they
thought. Several months ago the borers
began their work and then the originators
of the project learned to their delight that
they had in all human probability struck
a new El Dorado, It was found that the
lava stratum varied from fifteen to fifty
feet in thickness, after which gravel, rich
in shining gold, was found. So far, how
ever, bedrock has not been touched,
though several of the holes have been
sunk through ninety feet of gravel. As
was expected, vast volumes of water were
found beneath the surface, and it then
became apparent that the only feasible
method of working the Golconda was to
build a second Sutro tunnel. Besides
carrying off the water the tunnel would
be used to take the gravel to a point
where it could be separated from the
gold. It is proposed to construct the tun
nel large enough for a double car track
and at the same time put in a series of
riffles to capture the free gold which
would wash down with the outpouring
torrent from the mine.
Constant assays have been made while
the boring has been in progress, and the
enthusiasm of the men interested in this
great scheme can be imagined when it is
announced that the gravel has averaged
over $5 to the cubic yard. Should this
richness exist throughout the vast gravel
bed the wealth therein cannot be esti
mated. Millions upon millions of tons of
gravel can be worked at a comparatively
light cost after the preliminary work has
been done, and the stockholders are al
ready dreaming of lives of luxury and
pleasure when they shall have become
modern Croesuses. The only apprehension
now felt is that the bedrock is below
the level of the Stanislaus River, and if
this should prove a fact the development
work would cost much more than Is now
estimated. It would not be possible to
construct a tunnel through gravel, and if
the fears of the bedrock being too low
are realized another plan will be adopted.
Shafts will be sunk and tlÂ»e mine drift
ed This would be more expensive than
the tunnel scheme but the gold is there
and in sufficient quantities to warrant
the expenditure. Hydraulicking would
be an easy and cheap method of working
the mine 'if the restrictions on this sys
tem were not so stringent. The cost of
constructing restraining dams and the
other expenses of a hydraulic plant place i
an impassable barrier on working the
Shaw Flat country in this manner.
or several months negotiations have
been pending between the Columbia Com
pany and the London Exploration Com
pany, which is financed by the Roths
childs and the conference last week was
a result Captain Miens and P. N. Lilllen
thal who represent the Rothschilds in
this city, conferred with the Sonora peo
ple on Thursday, but an agreement was
not reached. The representatives of the
English company sought to drive too close
a bargain, and the conference adjourned
till the following day. At the second
meeting representatives of local capital
ists were present and the Rothschild
agents were Informed that their proposi
tion was not good enough. The Tuolumne
men were asked to state what they want
ed and they did so. Mr. McCormlck said
the originators of the scheme were willing
to give the capitalists a half interest in
the project if the other people would put
up $15,000 to complete the purchase of
claims now under bond and then construct
the tunnel and open the mine. This was
not acceptable to the foreign capitalists.
At this point Jacob Fisher of this city an
nounced that he represented a syndicate
which would take the proposition on the I
terms offered. He gave a satisfactory |
guarantee that the people he represented,
though he did not mention their names,
would take up the scheme and prosecute
it with energy and vigor. A subsequent
meeting was held and a plan for future
work decided upon.
A new company is to be organized which
will take up the development work and
carry it to completion. One million shares
of stock are to be issued, half of which
will be retained by the original promo
ters and the other half to go to the new
company. Already several members of
the old concern have announced their in
tention of taking stock in the new com
pany, thereby holding a double edge on
the proposition.
It has also been decided to continue
prospecting with the boring machines for
some time, and where the best results are
Indicated to begin work on the tunnel.
Before leaving for Sonora yesterday
morning the miners interested said that
the tunnel would be commenced in about
six months. It Is estimated that it will
take a year to complete the tunnel.

STRIKERS WINNING OUT.
Marble Cutters Employed by Ruffino
& Bianchi Will Resume Work
To-Morrow.
A conference was held yesterday after
noon between the strike committee of the
Marble Cutters' and Polishers' Union and
the firms of Ruffino & Bianchi and the
Vermont Marble Company.
The conference was partly successful,
as a compromise was effected with the
firm of Ruffino & Bianchi and the men
employed there will go back to work to
morrow morning.
No settlement could be made with the
Vermont Marble Company, however. The
strikers lay all their troubles on the head
of Manager Hawley of this concern. They
claim that the company intends inaugu
rating the colonization system. It al
ready owns a number of tenement houses
in the vicinity of the works and intends
opening a general store. Men will be em
ployed who live in the houses owned by
the company and they will be expected to
trade at the company's store. The strike
so far has been very quiet. There has
neither been attempt at nor threat of vio
lence. Another effort at adjusting mat
ters with the Vermont company will be
made to-morrow*.
The strikers have so far been ably as
sisted in their arbitrations by P. H. Mc-
Carthy, president of the Building Trades
Council, and Harry M. Saunders, the
business agent of the same body.

MELBA ARRIVES WITH
OTHER FAMOUS STARS
Will Be Heard in "Faust" To-Morrow
Evening Under Seppilli's
Direction.
THE world-famed operatic combination, of which the only Melba is the
bright star and Charles A. Ellis the proud and happy impresario, has
arrived. San Francisco is on the "gui vlve" of anticipation. The in
terim between now and to-morrow evening will drag slowly, and the
long whetted appetites of the _music-loving public will be but the keener for
the wait and discussion of the treat in store.
The first production is to be "Faust"â with a Melba Interpretationâ under
the direction of Seppilli. Every seat has been sold.
It was 10 o'clock yesterday morning when the long special train with the
famous artists aboard rolled onto the Oakland mole. It was composed of
eight coaches and two baggage cars, including the ' Campania, aboard
which was Mme. Melba and her party. Including the stars, male and fe
male, and the chorus, there were 180 people aboard the train. They ap
peared fresh and happy, and for the most part were well groomed. They
gathered in congenial circles and discussed the forbidding fog that hung
over the bay and city in six different languages.
Madame Melba chatted pleasantly about her last visit here, and it Is
needless to say she used pure, simple Anglo-Saxon speech. Prominent,
rushing here and there herding together his living musical boxes, was Wil
liam Parry, the veteran stage manager who has to his credit twenty-five
years of arduous service under Mapleson, and who fills a similar capacity
with the Ellis Opera Company.
"We had. a delightful trip," said Mr. Parry in answer to the inquiry as
to how the company stood the journey from Denver. "Everybody slept
well and has had a good breakfast."
"Don't they look clean and happy?" and the stage manager motioned
to the company, which he was' quietly driving into the ferry-boat.
"You see, the train is a traveling hotel. We have had sleepers and din
ing cars all the way throughâ in fact, every convenience of home."
An hour after their arrival the galaxy of stars were snugly at home at
the Palace. There were no signs about the hotel that the artists had ar
rivedâthat is, no immediate signsâ but a glance at the patchwork chlrog
raphy that graced the pages of the hotel register told a different story. The
combination of tongue-twisting cognomens made the pages of the register
look like score-sheets from some grand opera. There was Melba, Gadski,
De Lussan, Olitzka, Mattfeld, Challa, Van Cauteren, Bonnard, Pandolfini,
Bensaude, Boudouresque, Seppilli, De Vries, Stchmann, Van Hoose, Del Sol,
Cass, Rains, Fried, Rosa and Vlviani.
The press cards that were sent up to Melba, Gadski and De Lussan
brought forth a various assortment of replies. Mme. Melba could not possi
bly be visible to the naked eye of the reporter until late in the afternoon;
Mile, de Lussan was too fatigued to even consider an Interview under twenty
four hours' rest, while Mme. Gad-ski, like the genial and sturdy German that
she is, sent word that "there is no time like the present. Come up and I
will say my little say."
Frau Johanna Gadski possesses an appearance that impresses one. Her
physique indicates her wonderful vocal strength. Her throat is large and
beautifully developed, while her bust shows clearly whence comes the
power that makes her voice so rare. She converses pleasantly, and with a de
licious German accent. Her husband and child are with her. Mme. Gadski
is happy to visit California, of which she has read much and heard more.
She Hopes to make many friends during her stay here, and regrets that she
will not sing in the German. However, the Italian and French roles she is
sure will give her abundant opportunity.
As an artist Mme. Gadski, who has long been the most gifted of all Ger
man lyric sopranos, is well known. Her career with Damrosch made her an
idol of the Americans, and in her class she is without a rival.
All of the artists are anxious to make a favorable impression here. Bon
nard, the French tenor, and Pandolfini, the Italian; Rosa Olitzka, the con
tralto; Mme. Rosa Challa, soprano; Marie Mattfeld, one of the rising younger
mezzo sopranos, and in fact all of the artists express themselves as anxious to
know the public of San Francisco. CV'v
At 3 o'clock, when word came down from Mme. Melba's apartments to the
effect that she could be seen, Charlie Ellis piloted up the representatives of
the press. It is on the third floor, facing on New Montgomery street, that
the great prima donna is temporarily at home. A knock at her door Inter
rupted a soft accompaniment on the piano and caused a cessation of that di
vine melody that has' charmed the world. " "
"Come in and be seated. You hay caught me rehearsing a new song. It
is by Tosti and entitled 'Invano.' I am going to sing it for the first tiny* in
public when I appear in the 'Barber of Seville.' " It was the same genial, hap
py Melba that San Franciscans know." .
Her parlor was a garden of roses ond * violets,' and she looked the queen
flower of them all as she stood' in the center of the room, clad in some dreamy
velvet creation. -;" : ;' y* y ; '.-jHy :*'
"Arc you all seated?" and Madame Melba gazed inquiringly around.
"Well, I am glad to see you again and happy to be back in San Francisco,
of which I carried away such, pleasant memories last year. Look at the flow
ers that have been sent. Isn't it a royal welcome to receive from one's
friends? I love flowers like Ido my art." Then Madame, Melba burled her
face in a huge bunch of violets. When she emerged again she picked up the
conversation and showered smiles right and left.
"It must be nice to be a newspaper man, but I should not like to be a X
critic. I hope you people are not critics." There was a chorus of Instant de- â +.
nials. "Oh, then, truly, I am delighted to see you, Just 'as' - much so as I am _>
to get back to your lovely climate." , .... . , '>-
So on for a half hour Madame Melba chatted, without a single reference to <_>
her art. Suddenly she remembered Charlie Ellis had promised to take her over T
to the opera house, and she graciously begged to be excused, and as the party ?
left she stood in her doorway and waved a good-by. <Â«>
"Come and hear me Monday night," were her last words, and the reporters -f
smiled back and mentally calculated that if they did they would have to do y
without car fare for the next year. X

being that no complaint was filed against
her. That this complaint was not filed
was due solely to the neglect of the Po

Mrs. Johnson her liberty where otherwise
she would have, in all probability, been
forced to serve out the sentence imposed
upon herâ "three months for vagrancy.'

Mrs. Lord Explains Why She Paid
No Particular Attention to
Her Daughter's Be
trothal.
There was more joy in the Rodgers-
Nagle case yesterday. Judge Mogan lis
tened to a long array of witnesses whose
testimony only added to the brilliant rec
ord of Attorney Nagle when in an intox
icated condition.
Mrs. Rodgers, the fair milliner, who
claims she was the affianced wife of the
attorney and then threw him over, ex
plained in her cross-examination that she
had never thought much of the ability
of her ex-fiance as a lawyer and that
she only consulted him in regard to legal
affairs in very small matters.
Mrs. Lord, the mother of Mrs. Rodgers,
added to the many qualifications of the
gentleman ' who was to have been her
son-in-law by testifying, that he was in
the habit of taking brandy, and constant
ly and also was addicted to holding ani
mated conversations with himself.
During the trial Nagle sat at his attor
ney's elbow and prompted him. His re
marks were frequently so emphatic that
Judge Mogan was obliged to call the
prosecution to order.
Some new testimony was brought out
in the cross-examination of Mrs. Rod
gers. It was demonstrated to the satis
faction of the court that ring No. 7 was
a neat fit for the fair divorcee's finger
and that the same lucky number was
drawn over the Nagle digit with difficulty.
In recalling the church incident Mrs.
Rodgers corrected her former testimony
and declared that Nagle was not "hold
ing up" the church on the night she ran
from him and lost the disputed ring,
but was leaning in a beastly state of in
toxication up against the Iron fence.
"Why did you not go to your affianced
husband's assistance?" asked Mr. Collier,
attorney for the prosecution.
"I had assisted him too many times,
sententiously replied the witness. : y,
Mrs. Rodgers explained that she had
never been presented to Nagle's family
by the man whom she claims she was en
gaged to marry. "He said his people
wire fearful, and I was afraid to. meet
them. And so it was that I never went
with him to make public our engage
ment." Nagle's record as a most im
pulsive lover was established when the
lady declared that she had gone to a
place of amusement with Mr. Fee and
how the next day she received a message
from Nagle, who declared that the fact
of her being at the theater with another
man had kept him awake ail night.
Mrs. Lord, mother of the defendant,
testified in detail of the many drunken
visits of the attorney and how he had
told her that if Mrs. Rodgers did not bind
her fate to his he would have her heart's
blood* and then kill himself. â "--â  â â -::
"Mr. Nagle said to me." testified the
witness, "that he was a lawyer and a very
prominent man, and would not allow any
one to throw him over."
As to the ring that plays so prominent
a role in the case. Mrs. Lord declared that
she had never thought enough of the man
to look closely at the ring he gave her
daughter.
"My daughter is of age." Mrs. Lord
said, "and so I neither questioned her
concerning her engagement nor her ap
proaching marriage." y
The case will be continued on Tuesday
next.
Mrs. McGrath has just returned from
her recent trip to Paris and New York,
and will be pleased to attend again per
sonally to her many friends and custom
ers at the Dressmaking Parlors of the

WHEN the Eastern turfman
crosses the Rockies for the
first time he looks around San
Francisco and then marvels at
the two great race tracks the
. city supports.
"How does she do it?" he asks.
.And the question remains unanswered.
The native himself does not know.
But San Francisco nourishes them and
nourishes them well, even if the peniten
tiaries are filled to overflowing to do it.
The scores of poolrooms scattered about
the business portion of the city are the
stanche'st ally the race track has. They
are the training schools. The trusted em
ploye, the clerk and the messenger boy
takes his first gambling lesson in those
pitfalls. As his knowledge of things per
taining to racing Increases, his betting,
operations assume larger dimensions, and
he is found on the race track.
For a time fortune smiles on him. It
grows easy to pick the winning horses.
Then he becomes a plunger and loses.
He steals from his employer to get even,
and the doors of the penitentiary close on
him. That is one source of income the
tracks have.
As the close of every regular racing sea
son approaches the average track patron
finds a balance on the wrong side of the
ledger. This is not surprising. Gambling
games were not invented to be beaten.
The thoughtful speculator finds ntarly till
of his acquaintances in the same predica
ment. The papers come out in glaring
headlines, stating that Riley Grannan is
$40,000. loser, Pittsburg Phil is $25,000 be
hind the game, and this or that plunger
is, anywhere from ten to fifteen thousand
out. Misery likes company and the spec
ulator does not Bee where he is such an
idiot after all. Then he reads that Book
maker Johnnie Coleman is away to the
bad; that Eckert & Co. are behind on the
season; that such and such a bookmaker
is going to quit, and the situation becomes
complicated.
Who gets the money? Why, the tracks
get it, of' course. An old gambler will
say: "Sit in a stud-horse poker game
long enough and the game will have all
the coin." The income of a liberally pat
ronized race track is enormous.
Over a quarter of a million dollars were
invested In the Ingleside racing plant, and
ln two seasons it nearly, if not quite, paid
for itself. From the bar, restaurant,
programme and candy privileges large
dividends are received.
The bookies are each taxed $120 per day
rent and the Western Union Telegraph,
which furnishes service to the many pool
rooms all over tne country, is a source of
much gratification to the track manage
ment, contributing over $1200 a week.
â¢ Then, too, money paid by owners for
Scratching horses, stake money, money
received from selling-race bid-ups and
fines inflicted on jockeys by the starter
all swell the earnings.
Oakland track was not so expensive to
build as Ingleside, but its profits are fully
as Immense if not larger, -.( is conducted
on a more economical scale, and the
purses offered are smaller. The money
received from the books alone pays for all
the purses.
The piper must be paid, and there is lit
tle wonder that the Eastern visitor asks,
_â¢L i ~^ y^^^^o^c^^ w
The Race Track Juggernaut
"How does San Francisco do it?" Twenty
bookmakers' will handle on an average
$25,000 to a race, or $150,000 on a day's
booking. All -of this money, however, is
not furnished by local patrons. Probably
the heaviest bettors are the . Eastern
ones. But they re also the shrewdest.
Every spring, as the season draws to a
close, the Eastern bookmaker, with a
corps of . jockeys on his staff, will give
out for publication a memorandum of his
losses. When the new season opens again,
though, this same layer of odds is gen
erally first on the ground. It would not
be wise policy to state that he quit a big
winner on the meeting. The tongue of the
gossips would be set to wagging.
Chicago, with, its great, resources, can
support but a couple of months" racing,
and NeW York, with its millions of peo
pie to draw from and its numerous race
courses, only a trifle longer period.
How does San Francisco support two
great tracks through a season lasting
nearly seven months?

GITyS CURSE THE R/\GE
TRACK.
Dr. Perrault, the man who Introduced
and stands sponsor for the motion before
the Board of Supervisors to abolish pool
selling at the races, said:
"The bill will pass. A great many peo
ple say we cannot make it a law and stop
this force which Is bringing about the de
generation of hundreds of young boys,
girls, women and men.
"I am not looking at the subject from
any sentimental or hysterical point of
view. I am a business man, and I look at
this thing from a business point of. view.
I do not believe we can afford to allow an
evil to continue which certainly is filling
our papers with stories of disgrace and
suicide and crime of every sort. Take up
the paper any day and you will always
find some crisis which betting or gambling
has caused In the life of some man or wo
man. The Morgue has its stories, so have
the insane asylums and the jails.
"Men get the gambling fever . badly
enough, heave*] knows, but they can al
ways turn back and begin again and every
one is glad enough to give them a hand.
But a woman, that is a different matter
altogether.
"Take the case of a woman I know. She
went to Ingleside first just because she
had nothing to do. She is, or rather was,
for she is dead, a beautiful woman of
about 30, and had two little girls. Her
husband was a traveling insurance man.
Now, she went there merely to look on
and see what sort of a place it was; she
was as good a woman as 1 ever knew,
and I do not think she was particularly
weak, either, because I have known so
many others to do just the same way.
"She was alone and a very decent," gen
tlemanly looking man happened' to be % sit

the race, nor how to bet, and lie ex

five dollars. They always do win Â»hat

proposed that he should show her about
the place and they ended up in a place
where apparently respectable men and
women were having wine.
"That was the beginning. She had noth
ing to do and plenty of money, she was
pretty and interesting. She went regu
larly, began drinking and then using her
husband's money. He came home, saw
the change, found out the cause. She con
fessed everything. He said it wassail
right, she had lost heavily, but would
have better luck next time. He gave her
$100 and told her to try again.
"That day while she was away he had in
a man. sold every stick of furniture, took
his children and went East. He would
have nothing more to do with her. She

tried to make her living out at the tracks,
could not stand the life and took poison. !
"It .took only about six months to ac
complish the whole business.
"Young boys are corrupted just as bad- :
ly. ...Some parents have no objection to
their, boys' going/others object, and the'
boys will lie and steal' to get out there,
and then pick up every vice In 'creation.
"I have had parents bring their boys to
me and wonder what in the world was the
matter. The boys think it is smart to go
there and to copy as. near as they can the â¢
swagger and foulness they see. They will
do anything, and some things are not
printable in your paper or any other, for
the sake of tips.
"Women will stand shoulder to shoul
der with the worst outcasts, talk, drink
with them, anything to get a tip. And.
tips come high. Tips come very high. The
touts and frequenters of the track are not
there to help any one to win unless. they
get something for it. Let every woman
remember that. Betting is a business, it :
is bread and butter to the touts. Bankers
or doctors or merchants do not tell their
methods to strangers. Neither do the
touts, though women when they begin
think the men are 'kind.' It's all non
sense, and they learn it soon enough, but
not till they are where they cannot get
away. r e ;.>â >- :-.'.
i "It Is bad enough for men, but when a
woman begins she never stops. It is like
drinking or crime of apy sort, women lose
their heads. -V -.- ;.- y_. .-'*â 
"I have had some queer experiences
since this motion to suppress the evil
came up. before the Board of Supervisors.
There was one, a man it would surprise
you if I could tell you his name. He has
three daughters, and they are all in , the
best society in. San Francisco. One is
married and one is a mere child. He has
plenty of money and he came to me and
said he was ready to put up any. amount
if money could help \ pass this law. He
was so earnest I got him to tell me
why he was so Intensely interested in the
matter. â¢ .-" .. ' . â¢ ~\.~
--" Man. I have three daughters and two:
grandchildren. Every morning when I
take up my paper I look it through to see
if disgrace has come openly.'
"He Is only one of dozens who " have
"'â '- '
tried to give encouragement, not only to
me but to every Supervisor who voted on
the right side. I have no fear that the bill
will fall. Let the people only know what
is actually going on and the evil will be
stopped; Any one who votes With the
track might just as well go home and
pack his grip, for he is doomed. He will
find out that it is true. too. There may be
a fight, but again there may not. People
seem determined, and I think we can car
ry it.
"The business men say we can't afford
this continual drain. Money which ought
to go to pay tradesmen, to pay house rent,
to keep up churches and schools, is divert
ed. Some one has to suffer. Then again
those who win are little better off than
those who lose. Getting anything for
nothing is demoralizing.
"When a youth thinks he can pick up
$50 or $100 in a morning at. the track he
has perfect contempt for the quiet grind
which brings, in $15 or $20 a week. He
thinks when he wins $20 that he is making
$20 a day and spends it at that rate. He is
swimming on a bladder, and the bladder, is
bound to break and then he can't swim
alone. >
."I am glad the papers are stirring up
this matter. People, every one, read the
papers, and If you tell every one just how
things are out at Ingleside they will get
up and sweep Ingleside and kindred mon
ster evils off the face of the earth."
The race track on a holiday, resplendent
with its gay coterie of women on pleasure
bent, gayly decked in diamonds, furs and
silks, the demi-monde out for display, is
one thing, and the race track on a regular
day of the long and tiresome season is an
other. Its women are not so gay. They
are poorly clad, anxious faced, ner
vous, trembling wrecks, desperately
rushing down before each . race into
the women's" poolroomâ innocently dis
guised a's a "refreshment room" â
clutching frantically .at their . hard
earned savings and wondering whether
to depend on their own judgment
or whether to trust to the advice of the
urbane, smooth-tongued "official pool
buyers." The latter rush around jingling
tantalizing coins in their hands, hoping
thus to entice some poor victim into bet
ting a dollar, perhaps her last, on the
next race. . y
A different spectacle, truly. On the gala
day,*; with. laughter and jollity and reck
lessness, one forgets, as he throws a five
or a ten or a twenty on a race just for
a "flyer,", that down below in the women's
poolroom hundreds of: women, who can
not afford to venture even a dollar, are
clubbing together twenty-five cents apiece
on which they % hope, y perhaps, to win
enough to buy necessaries for a forlorn,
poverty-stricken family. For that Is what
hundreds of poor deluded creatures do
every day at the race track.
The insults, too. that some women are
subjected to :by some of the coarse,
indecent men who - attend the races
is in itself infamous, and the old
precept taught us by our grand
mothers that a woman who conducts her
self properly will never be insulted by
word or action is exploded if one goes to
the races. Even on the cars, where men
crowd In like so many cattle on a freight
train on their way to the track, they dis
cuss the various -women present and
make remarks loud enough . for them to
be heard by the woman under discussion..
I saw one young girl, modestly dressed
and quiet in manner, being leered at by
a stout, red faced man. with a decided
"horsey" appearance. As the passengers
filed out of the car he managed to squeeze
behind the girl, and I overheard him say:
".You're a winner 'yourself.' I'd like to bet
my money on you."
The girl flushed up and looked straight
ahead as if she did not hear his remark.
He followed her all the way to the en
trance of the track, saying things to her,
while she continued deaf to his remarks.
She afterward told me that if it wasn't
for creating a disturbance and sensation
she would have given him a hard slap in
the face. "He had pursued me for a
week in this same manner, and I am sure
I have been most particular not to no
tice him, as he is so very vulgar and com
mon."
STORIES OF WOMEJ^ WHOSE
LIVES H/\VE BEEN WREGKED
BY THE AGE TRACK.
- One finds women of all ages gambling
at the track. Even children play the
races, ahd so do women in their dotage.
One little shriveled old womanâ a verit
able mummy with her parchment skin
almost black and the whites of her eyes
so discolored as to give the eye an ap
pearance of being entirely brown is one
of the regular attendants at the races,

chatelaine bag. , ' -;', ,'y y" "
Eight years ago she lost her husband,
and in the house where she lived was a
bookmaker. . He advised her, instead "of

double her money. He made the plan ap

ey In. a bank could only make a few dol
lars a year in interest, while at the
track by playing a ten or twenty on a
"sure thing" that he would, give her,
she could win hundreds of dollars.
"I was green in those days in. the mat
ter of racetrack doings," she said, in re
counting her experience, "and it all ap
peared so easy. You see me now, as
black as an old pot, my dear. I was as

them. I lost every cent of the $2000 in
just three months; lost it by paying the
bookmaker for my tips, and the rest I
lost betting on the wrong horses. When
ever the tips he gave me were wrong,
he'd try and console me by telling' me
that he was also a heavy loser.
"So much worry, the loss' of all my
money, has made me a physical wreck,
and it affected my liver so that. l. have
turned this terrible color and have lost
all my flesh. My friends of .former days
don't recognize me. and now all that is
left is to play here at the trafck what
little money I get by mending clothes."
I watched th" old creature as she
darted off to see how the betting was go
ing for the next event, and pretty soon
I saw her cornered by three other aged
women, and among them they made up
a dollar to bet on the race.
One . short, plainly dressed Portuguese
woman, who looked as if she had bent
over the washtub all her life; interested
me. I wondered how she could afford to
take the time to play the races. I found
out that her daughter works in a shirt
factory and gets $5 a week, while, as I
suspected, the mother takes in washing.
She told me that she got up every morn
ing at 3:30 o'clock and managed 'to get
the washing out and in again before time
to go to "the races. She takes her little
pittance and that of her daughter and.
hies away to her elysian fieldsâ the race
trackâevery afternoon. I watched her
on the boat on the way home from the
track and she sat in a corner facing the
water.
I noticed she put her handkerchief to
her eyes frequently, and after a tew mo
ments the , tears welled up- to her eyes
and overflowed, running in a stream down
her careworn face. She had lost her
hard earnings.
The big majority of the women who
play the races I found, to be -ignorant,
hard-working women, who have plodded
along, all of their lives, saving. little or
nothing, and to whom' the .thought of win
ning a dollar and not having to earn it
seems, indeed, a glimpse of. paradise. This
chimera so works upon their imagination
that they feel sure that they will win
and in time become rich. through Betting.
Instead of thinking how hard they have
worked to get the dollar, they think how
easy it Is to make one by betting r , on
that dollar. They are simply hard-work
ing women whose characters', are v. too
weak to withstand the alluring tempta
tions of the racetrack. And the manage
ment, instead of protecting their foolish
weakness, continues to spread the allur
ing snares. ': *'.
One young creature, who always, at
tends the races dressed' in black, proba
bly to form a more striking contrast with
her painted cheeks and blackened eyes,
has a history that is only a variation of
the old, old story of the racetrack.^ When
her mother died a few years ago she
was left with a few hundred dollars. She
was persuaded to try her luck at the
track by a gypsy, who told her that sue

of the races. I am informed that her
husband has tried to break up her mania
for betting in every way, but without
avail. She has lost a fortune there, but,
like hundreds of others, she still plays
and hopes some day to win back her
money: â¢-'â â :

just discovered that* his wife has se
cretly been playing away all their sav
ings at the racetrack.' It is another house

This woman has -been given a certain

GOSSIP OF A SOCIETY BUD
DEAREST MARGUERITE: Here is
something new. Whist! while I
tell you. You can't believe it?
Well, dear, I don't wonder, for it
does seem strangeâ and cruel.
But Addle Murphy was really and truly
presented to the Queen. Is it fair? I'm
sure the rest- of us have cultivated the
broad "a" as carefully as she has. We
have even been known to call an elevator
a "lift." By constant practice we have
mouthed Burlingame into "B'lingum,"
and no longer hall a "coupe," but a "cab."
Haven't we taught our brothers to turn
up their trousers when it rains in Lun
non? We would pass before any com
mittee as Anglomanlacs.
So why should Addie Murphy, who is
no more English than 1 the rest of us, don't
, her know, be presented to the Queen?
I can"t imagine Addie in the mile of court
train I see a puzzle picture with the
query Where Is the girl? For you know
Addie'is just so high, and one would think
that she- would get lost in the oceans of
billowy satin.
Her letter came this morning. Just a
meager lineâ "Mrs. Swift took us, .and
she says we went through it beautifully."
Now whom does she mean by "us"? I
suppose "us" translated means Miss
Swift and Addie. I never can tell exactly
what Addie means when she gets excited.
Her verbs and nouns go through a --rand
right and left, while the pronouns do a
double-shuffle. After this lucid sentence
she goes on to describe their gowns, and
though I wade knee deep through a sea
of adjectives I can never conjure up a
gown from a written description.
Besides, what do I care about the gown?
All court gowns look alike to me. or to
anybody else, for the matter of that. I
confess the pictures of court gowns that
I have seen impress me. For that one
woman should carry so much dry goods
on her back is a feat worthy of a better
CÂ£ Not' a word does Addle say about how
she felt face to face with royalty. Not
a line devoted to 11. R. H. the Prince of
Wales. Just "I'll tell you all the rest _of
it next time," and then a tantalizing Ph.
"The Queen spoke to me, which is out
of the ordinary." , :
Now by what method of divination, O
ye oracles, am I to know what the Queen
said? She couldn't have said "Howdy.
or "Good morning, have you used Pearl
S l've still another chance, but not even
the charm of third time can tempt mc- to
hazard another guess.
No sooner had I galloped through the
letter than I rang up the other girls and
let them feel the fangs of the green
eyed monster. For the rest of us have
crossed the pond. We, too, have been the
victims of mal de mer. We have done
Westminster and the Tower and have had
a sneezing acquaintance with the London
fog. But a peep at the Queen's drawing
room and a presentation to H. R. . H.
Victoria, Queen of England, Empress,
etc., etc.â that was denied us. --Â«*-Â«

pere to the contrary notwithstanding, see
what a ' charming brother-in-law Ethel
gave her. By the way, they say that Mr.
Murphy has not yet forgiven Ethel for
choosing Mr. Kiddle in preference to an
empty-headed youth with a long bank
account. :i -
I don't believe any amount of hobnob
bing with titles^ could make Addie other
than a sweet, simple, big hearted little
girl. So it's glad we are that she stood
at royalty's elbow. And providing she

INTERESTING SUBMARINE MINE EXPLOSIONS.
Submarine mine fields were adopted so
generally as a methodâ in some cases
as the -only available methodâ of harbor
defense during the late war with Spain
that most people will, we think, be in
terested in examining the accompanying
views of mine explosions photographed
while removing the mine fields in Balti
more harbor after hostilities ceased.
These photographs were secured by Lieu
tenant Charles W. Kutz, United States
Engineers, who had charge of the work
of removing the mines which defended
that port.
As most of our readers will probably re
member, it was found after the war that
it would be too dangerous to raise the
mines in many places, owing, to the fact
that the openings provided were too
small to .remove the dynamite from the
shell without risk of explosion. It .was,
therefore, decided to explode the mines
as the safest method. ;
Referring to the illustrations: Figure 1
shows the result of exploding a mine of

MARION HARLAND DISCUSSES
AFTERNOON TEAS
WHAT is afternoon tea like?"
writes a woman from the far, in
terrogative West. "From trav
eled friends and social events
I and society novels, we glean that it is not
; what we call tea hereâ the third meal of
; the day, more or less hearty, according
'to the number of men folk who are to
partake of it. Some English novels, and
, a few stories of high life in America, give
; one the idea that it is not unlike my Irish
cook's habit of putting a cup of the brew
j 'to her lips whenever she feels dispoged.'
' Do fashlonists at the East keep the Chi
â  nese herb 'on tap?' â â - ;: t ',. -.â ,"â 
I begin my reply to my vivacious cor
j respondent by saying what afternoon tea,
;as it should be, Is not "like." In some
j towns and xi tiesâ particularly in the lav
j ish '" Southâ the effort to introduce this
simplest of 'social functions has failed ig
nominiously becauseâ like dishwashing,
toast-making arid tea-making, speaking
the. truth and spellingâ natural meth
od Is the easiest. The custom evoluted, or
rather, degenerated into an "affair," with
elaborate refreshments.
In every j respectable English home, be
it palace or cottage, tea Is served between
4 and 5 .o'clock every afternoon in the
year. â¢ The crone in the almshouse takes
hers direct from the hob in winter, and in
summer hobbles with her black teapot, a
teaspoonful of the precious leaves in the
bottom, to' the common kitchen to have
it filled. Her betters In name and in
worldly gear assemble about the tea
equipage in drawing room or library, or
in the family "parlor." For the wealthy
there are tea 'tables of divers patterns;
some with leaves that draw out to ac
commodate cups, and saucers when set
in array. The- conventional afternoon tea
table Is lower than those intended to hold
bric-a-brac and books. The chair occu
pied by the mispress of the house or one
of her daughters' is low and broad, that
she may sit at her ease while making and
dispensing' the beverage. The central fig
ure upon the tray is a tea kettle of. silver,
copper, brass or lacquered Japanese ware,
with a spirit* lamp beneath. When the,
water boils the tea is "masked"â 1. c., a
little poured upon tne dry leaves in the
pot, 'a' wadded "cozy" is fitted over the
latter, and the tea is "drawn" for about
two minutes before the rest of the water
is added. _
The cups are passed by a servant if

or intimate friends, are present to whom

It ceases to be afternoon tea, a rest sta

the 7 or 8 o'clock dinner. <
It is a wholesome symptom in our fev

more and more prevalent. In tens of
thousands of homes in city and in coun

in warm weather and in the country,
afternoon tea lends itself to numberless
pleasing variations. Served upon ve

and see a woman with one of these big
black bags hanging at her side and a
newspaper in her handâ the racing chart
editionâ you can make up your mind that
she is a "regular," a woman who plays
the races every day.
To the unsophisticated these huge
purses look enticing. One might imagine
that they go home every day after the
races filled with coin. That is a mis
take. ' They usually contain a bag of
crackers or sandwiches, a flask of whisky,
a pair of opera glasses, perhaps some
headache powders and a little purse with
more money in it when they arrive than
when they return home after the races.
The women who do win at the races â
the ones who sit calmly In the grand
stand and go down into the poolroom only
to get a boy to cash their checks for them
â are in most cases wives or relatives of
the bookmakers and jockeys, who pick
out the winners for them. It Is these
women, to all appearances risking their
money as do the rest, who encourage the
hundreds of poor working women to
squander their earnings. These book
makers and turf men can well afford to
let their wives or women friends play the
; races, and occasionally lose if need be,
for they well know it is the steady stream
of quarters, of 50-cent pieces, of dollars
of the hundreds of poor working women
that countsâ that swells their coffers.
These women play a small amount upon
each event every day of the season, and
these constant driblets amount to thou
sands of dollars in the end.
The methods of the "touts" are most
despicable, and were not the race track
a gambling place of the worst character
they would not be tolerated. Signs "Be
ware of 'touts' " should at least be
placed in the women's poolroom for the
benefit of the uninitiated. These fellows
who have hung around the stables until
they think they know the run of things
slink around in the women's poolroom,
occasionally giving free advice on the
races or the form of the horses, thereby
ingratiating themselves with the betting
women. Finally, after they have re
mained around sufficiently long to begin
to look stationary and people begin to
have confidence in them, they side up to
you and agree to put your money up for
you. They will do it honestly for a day
or so, until they begin to get a half dozen
of women or more to buy pools through
them, and some fine day, with perhaps
a half dozen five or ten dollar bets of
different women in his hands, your tout
suddenly disappears never to be seen
again.
Not a day passes that women are not
the dupes of these vicious touts. Ir they
report their losses to the bookmakers or
to the policemen they get no sympathy
and are told that they should have bought
from the "official pool buyers," who
charge 35 cents for their services. There
are many ways, however, by which wo
men may be cheated even by these high
officials. At the Ingleside track it Is so
arranged that it is impossible for wo
men to watch the figures of the book
makers, and so they must take the odds
given them by the pool buyers to whom
they trust their money.
Some of these women bettors have their
favorite jockeys and bet more largely
upon the winning jockey than they do
upon the horse. There is no doubt that
they know them* better, for a great many

'days since with a creature old enough to

and a > rusty black cashmere dress.
While they drank in succession three
"whisky straights'," I overheard the
younger woman in speaking of the next
race say:--; Oh. lookin' at ims yere race,

I. don't* like him as a jockey, though I

A race track man Informed me that
there were in- all about 300 regular wo
men gamblers, with a daily attendance
of between one and two hundred. This
does not include * the flotsam and jetsam
who are "accidents of the hour" and are
there by chance two to three hundred
strong. Out of this "floating popula
tion" come forth in time the habitues who
replace the ones who are "played out."
This same track -man also said: "For
weeks at a time some of the 'regulars'
will not be able to come to the track, as
they get out of money; but as soon as
they can beg, borrow or makeshift tb get
a dollar they, are on deck again. One wo
man who was a regular attendant here
for five seasons suddenly disappeared and
as she usually got hex advice from me, I
maije inquiries about her. She was a
Widow, past middle age. She was very
reticentapd told me nothing of her life,
which,, by the way, is unusual, for wo
men gamblers" make confidants of most
every- one out at the track from the 'tout'
to the jockey. They* seem to get some
satisfaction in telling their troubles. But,
as I was saying, this woman was very
close mouthed about her affairs. When
she disappeared I made inquiries on the
outside and discovered that she had con
tracted a heavy cold out at the track, and
that, together with the worry* and sleep
less nights brought on by heavy losses
on the races, pulled her down on a sick
bed. from which she never rose, and only
last month she was buried from a Fifth
street lodging house. She is doubtless
better off under the turf than on it," he
concluded, with a feeble attempt at jocu
larity.
One woman, gaunt and pale, attends the
track as often as she can afford admit
tance money. Poor crea.ture she is, thin
ly clad, young and delicate, with a
peeked-face little child tugging at her
skirts. She sat up among the drafty
seats in the grand stand a few days ago
with the tears rolling down her wan
chocks. I moved over to where she sat
and asked her if she,' too. had lost.
"My God! lost?" she said; "I am ruined;
my husband will beat me to-niglit wrfen
I get home. Home! Oh, how I dread
the thought of returning. Do you see
this and this," she said, rolling up her
sleeve on a wasted arm which was cov
ered with welts from a rawhide. "My
husband does that with his strong right
arm," she added, with a ghastly smile
flickering across her pale face. "He
drinks and . loafs and sends me out to
earn money for the living. I wash win
dows and scrub, but, oh, I get so tired,
and so when I get a few dollars together
I come out here. I win sometimes and
then he takes it and I am.no better off.
To-day I have lost $3â three big round
dollars; that means days of hard work to
me, and I haven't even car fare. left and
will have to walk home. I don't mind
the walk, but it is raining and Willie,"
she said, looking at the sick child at her
side, "is really too weak to walk. I don't
have any medicine to give him, but still
I have to take him with me, as I have
no one to leave him with, poor child."
Willie hasn't many more months to
worry over, I thought as I looked at his
big, wistful eyes with dark circles around
them and his sunken, feverish checks.
Quite the most touching incident to
what ends the race track takes women
was told me by an habitue of the track
out at Ingleside. '\'V
"Though I myself." she said, "have
managed to keep respectable and yet
play the races, It is only because I have
a husband who knows of my mania dnd
humors it by giving me money to bet, al
though he can little afford to waste
money; but I had a friend who has sunk
to the lowest dregs of degradation
through this very track.
"A few years ago she was a bright
young woman, married to a good, honest,
highly respected man. They boarded at
a fashionable downtown boarding house,
and not having any responsibilities and a
great deal of leisure, this woman began
to go to the races just for amusement.
She would come over and beg me to go
with her, and whenever I could spare the
time I would go. Finally, one dayâ it
was a holiday, when the grandstand wa3
crowded with fashionable people she de
cided that just to make it a little more
exciting she would bet $3 on a certain
horse. She did so and won.
"That $5 proved her ruin. She began
to go regularly and oftentimes she'd go
and never tell me or any one else that
she had been to the races. I noticed
that she was becoming thin and wor
ried looking, and also that her husband
seemed to have something on his mind.
"Matters went on for a year, and I be
gan to notice that my friend's breath
smelled strongly of liquor whenever I saw
her. I began to drop her by degrees, as
I saw she had changed. The next thing
I heard was that her husband was suing
for a divorce on the grounds of intem
perance and another graver charge.
"She then left the fashionable boarding
house and began living in a lodging
house. I was afterward credibly in
formed that during the three years of her
married life she ruined her husband
financially by gambling, and when the
divorce was granted to the husband she
seemed to lose the last glimmer of self
respect. | She became an habitue. of the
track, and likewise took up the society
of the jockeys and track men.
"Even these people finally abandoned
her and evaded her when she 'came
around them, for she had become a
drunken sot.' . '' ..
"Poverty made it necessary to pawn
the very clothes on her back, and in or
der to buy a drink she went Into a sa
loon and tried to get one on the security
of a silver thimble, the only thing she
had left in the world to offer as security.

MY summer wardrobe worries j
me," said a friend the other
day. "What perplexes me is
what to do with the bargains
I have already invested in."
It is not given to every
woman to shop both wisely and well. And
the things which under the hands of an
overplausible salesman seem too tempt
ing to resist prove on closer inspection
but a snare and delusion. A pair of gloves
she discovers are rather more than shop
soiled. Oh! those two petticoats of rust- ;
ling silk, what shall we do with them? ;
How could she ever forget that fickle
Fashion has decreed that our garments
for the nonce shall be innocent of rustle? j
.- And so on and so on.
Now, I confess that I have advised buy- j
ing bargains. But unless you are per- I
fectly sure that you can tell a genuine j
bargain shun sales as you would shun
the plague. Make up your mind before you |
go exactly" how much you can afford
to spend and what you want to spend it j
on, and do not, under any circumstances, |
be persuaded into purchasing things for j
which you can see no immediate need. j
The latter course is the way modistic j
madness lies. Things that are bought ]
because "they are so cheap" or "so j
pretty" or "I am sure I can find a use for I
them" by and by" have an unpleasant j
knack of not living up to your expecta- j
tions.
"Staple articles," as thegroeers put it, j
are the only safe bargain investments.

I have listened to words of wisdom from ]
a modiste on the subject of new skirts, j
and I have taken copious notes, which
you shall have the beneflt of. But flrst I
must tell you a little secret. One or two
of the ultra-fashionable modistes who
have just returned from Paris have j
brought with them the latest Parisian j
fad. They are carefully cut knee breeches j
of silk or satin, to be worn instead of
petticoats. There was a hue and cry
some time ago about tights, but it proved
a false alarm. The modistes say, how
ever, that the knee breeches are very
popular in Paris, and they are offering
all sorts of plausible inducements to make
them popular here. "It's the only way to
make the overskirt fit. properly," they
affirm. Now, we all want the sheathlike
. skirt, but at the . cost of wearing knee ;
breeches? That's the question.
These silk and satin affairs are called
knee breeches advisedly, for the knicker- i
bocker, as a rule, such as we are used I
to wearing for cycling and golf, has
a small amount of fullness at the back I
and knees. But the knee breeches worn I
in conjunction with these . latter-day
gowns cannot be admitted any extra li- \
cense of this kind, so, although they are
made to fit comfortably, there is an ab
sence of wrinkle and crease about them
that calls eloquently for the perfection of
cut that comes only from a' master hand.
. Perhaps these knee breeches will solve
the problem that confronts the ultra well j
dressed woman. For . how is she to live
nnd move in skirts that are made with
Fuch extraordinary* tightness and preci
sion of outline that the ordinary move
ments necessary for a mild stroll or a
gentle waltz seem almost out of the ques
tion? ...
Certain it is, if the present fashion is to
hold good any length of time, the athletic
girl must sacrifice the joys of swift and
unconventional motion to a most careful |
and decorous use of her nether limbs.
In spite of this excessive shrinkage in
the upper parts of the modish woman's
skirt, she still clings lovingly to the vol
uminous outline that drags and billows
about her feet. In order to make up for
the knee breeches some of the dressmak
ers are utilizing a rather curious method
for obtaining the billowy effect. A knee
\ deep flounce (or many flounces) is sewn
upon a broad band and then lightly
stitched Inside the lining just below the
â¢knees. The flounce Is made either of very
'fine cambric or silk, and gives all the
effective fussiness and flufflness of an
elaborate petticoat while doing away with
" any unnecessary bulkiness about the hips.

"The fashionable skirt of the moment."
said the modiste, "has absolutely to be
made in two parts, the seams on the hips
being opened almost down to the knees.
Ornamental buttons and buttonholes are
the safest method of enabling the wearer
to be securely and smoothly poured into a
garment that is without fullness on the
hips, back or front. The double ridge of
buttons down the back is no longer de
rigueur. The fastenings must be down the
sides.
Shaped flounces or the Spanish flounces
have been abandoned, and the draped
overskirt is the proper thing. The tailor
draped skirt is the simplest of the draped

The girl who goes in heavily for light
colored neck ribbons finds herself in a
perpetual state of poverty. But this is
unnecessary if one but knows the art of
washing ribbons. The finest of double
faced satin ribbons can be washed to
look like newâ better, for they will
have an added softness that is really
enchanting. Fill the basin in the bath
room with tepid water; lay the ribbon on
the marble edge and go over it carefully
with common kitchen soap, water arid a
stiff nail brush. Under no circumstances
must the silky stuff be wrung out or
folded. After the rubbing rinse well by
dipping into clear water, and then slap
the ribbon on the painted wall of the
bathroom. When dry it will fall off of its
own accord. Ribbons of the daintiest
hues can be cleaned perfectly ln this
way, and the heavier and nicer the rib
bon the better the result.

Men's Glot es for Women.
p^=3HKRE is no denying the fact that
the girl of to-day is determined to
be as comfortable as she possibly
H can, though a woman. She is still
trammeled with skirts. That is
something she cannot be rid of, although
she has tried everything she could think
0 f_ hortening them for rainy days and
even trying to discard them for bloomers
when riding the bicycle. She even went
so far at one time as to try knickerbock
ers when wheeling, but she found that
she was the object of so much ridicule
that she has gone back to skirts, albeit
short ones.
'' But in every other respect she can use
"brother's" wearing apparel. Her tailor
made suits are patterned after his so far
as possible, even to sack or cutaway
coats, with vests and "dickies."
It may be a matter of surprise to find
that those same "dickies" are really fast
ened to the snowy, white cuffs she wears
by the body of a "really truly" man's
shirt. Perhaps this will shock some peo
ple. But the fact Is that when one de
sires to wear a close-fitting vest and jack

fasten them to except the coat, and the

vapor. No injury will result from In
haling .this vapor. The face must be
washed thoroughly and smeared with cold
cream before the steaming operation be
gins. It should also be followed by a
careful washing and massaging with cold
cream. . , .
An excellent cream for this purpose is
made from the following ingredients:
Spermaceti, one-half ounce.
White wax, one-half ounce
Oil of sweet almonds, two and a hair
ounces. * - â¢ â â  .
* Rosewater, three-fourths ounce.
Powdered borax, twenty grains.
Essence of cloves, five drops.
Dissolve the borax in the rosewater and
add the essence of cloVes. Melt the first
three ingredients in' a porcelain kettle
When melted remove from the heat and
add the rosewater (all at once). Then
beat quickly with an egg-beater until the
mixture is cold and firm. 'â¢;**Â£-
In wiping the face after steaming it be
careful to do it thoroughly enough to re
move everything that may have exuded
from the torpid pores not rubbing t hard
enough, however, to irritate the skin. Be
sides steaming, the face must be -scrubbed
every night with a camels hair face
brush warm. water and castiie soap, fol
lowed by massage with the cold cream.
For blackheads that are very obstinate
a more \ severe treatment Is necessary.
First dab the parts affected with hot
water. Then to a few drops i of lemon
juice add about ten drops of glycerine in
a saucer Rub this on to the blackheads
with the finger. After ten minutes rub
the skin with the cut lemon and bathe
with rosewater. Do this for several
nights, and then wash in the morning with
a lotion composed of:
Rosewater, 3 ounces. ,
Tincture of benzoin. 1 tablespoonful.
Then commence the nightly scrubbing,
as described above. This must be con
tinued even after the blackheads have
disappeared,' for the little openings hav

too. In fact, I know of a girl who delib
erately went into her brother's room and.
in his absence, delivered the following
monologue to still her own conscience:
"Dearest brotherâ I borrow your
StudS?" :: -
"Yes, and welcome, sister." Whereupon
she helped, herself not only to the studs,
but also a necktie and scarfpin, and his
new shoes and socks.
"What!" I hear some one exclaim In
dismay, "shoes and socks!"
Yes, his shoes and socks. And why not?
In the first place, so far as the shoes are
concerned, they are much more sensible
than her own. They have good thick
soles and are made of warm, stout leather
and. so far as one can see by the styles
of the present day, there is very little
difference in their appearance. Her feet
were large- and his were small, so that
the -size was a perfect fit. y- *
As for socks} she wore flannels and
woolen tights, and that was enough for
her limbs, so that the half hose were quite
as sensible as the rest of- her apparel.*
Of course, our girl has not yet discarded
her corset. She. cannot. She needs it. for
comfort as well as appearance, but she
does not lace it tightly and wears the lat
est straight effects of the Parisian styles,
and these give plenty of room to breathe
fully, while they are well shaped.
As for hat, -the soft fedora has long
been worn by our girl. V' .".iv
Her latest steal from "brother. how
ever, is his gloves. The plain tailor-made
street suit is no longer complete without
the thick suede finish dogskin glove with
one button clasp at the wrist. Some
gloves are made with two buttons, but
the one button is the latest for "brother"
and consequently for "sister."
It Is already rumored that the tailor
made girl has discarded her swishing pet
ticoats, and she has, but not entirely. She
does not wear them with her latest tight
ly fitting tailor-made costumes, but she
doe* wear them with her visiting gowns,
and also all evening gowns. She cannot
give up their pleasant rustle on all occa
sions.
as are flesh-producing, will also help. I
do not know anything to suggest for the
long, heavy eyebrows, except to trim them
occasionally and to pull out a halr here
and there. "Cold freckles" are frequently
caused . by disorder of internal organs,
usually the liver, and usually require to
be treated medically. The stains are de
posited beneath the epidermis, and will
depart only when the scarf skin is re
moved; and when the latter grows again
the freckles will also return. The safest
way to doctor them is to treat them with
lemon juice. Apply this with a soft cloth
and let: it dry on the skin, and then rub
in a good cold cream to allay irritation. If
you find the pure lemon juice too severe
dilute it with a little rosewater, leaving
it strong enough, however, to make the
face smart, but not enough to roughen or
scratch it. ' Â»
DISCOURAGEDâ To-day's Beauty Talk
will help you as far as the blackheads are
concerned. The* treatment that you are
giving your face is all wrong. In the "first
place, discard the rubber brush and get
in its place a camel's halr complexion
brush. When there are both pimples and
blackheads the pimples must be got rid
of before treating for the blackheads.
So do not use the brush until the eruption
has disappeared, as it will irritate them.
The following wash will. I am sure, help
you: One ounce glycerine, one-half ounce
rosemary water and fifteen drops of car
bolic acid. The application should, of
course, be combined with proper living,
care being taken as to diet, exercise and
the dally tepid bath. A good cold cream
should also be used. When the skin is
entirely free of the eruptions then begin
with your camel's hair brush, to do away
with the blackheads, following; the treat
ment laid out In the talk. Use nothing
but pure Imported castiie soap on the face
and never use pure alcohol. Instead of
the rosewater and glycerine use the cold
cream after washing the face at night.
Cheese will sometimes cause the face to
break out in . the most distressing way.
Possibly your blood Is thin. In that case
you eat too many oranges. One in the
morning before breakfast Is enough.
â¢ IDA'R.â Drinking milk, if it does not
make you bilious, will not affect . the
blackheads one way or the other. For
the coarse pores in your cheeks use the
following astringent wash: Take a half
pint bottle and. place In It three table
spoonfuls of fresh, uncooked cucumber
Juice. - Half fill : the bottle " with : elder
flower water and 'then add two table
spoonfuls of eaude cologne. Shake well
and add very -slowly half an ounce: of
simple tincture of benzoin; shaking the
mixture now and then. ; Fill the bottle
with elder-flower water. Use two or three
times a daj', letting it dry on the skin.
However, If you have any blackheads,
don't use the wash until you have got rid
of them.

faithful massage with the orange flower
skin food. By "massage" I mean a gen

forehead first of all rub in the skin food
until the skin has partially absorbed it.
Then place the thumbs on the temples,
the first fingers at the top of the tore

R Râ l am afraid I can suggest noth

in the water you wash your face in to
make it less oily and touch the pimples
with tincture of myrrh. Any good drug

MISS L,. LEWlSâ Sunday before last

i subject of pimples. -As your letter was
written some time before that, I feel sure
you- must have seen it and benefited. The
â¢red nose indicates impure blood or defect
!in circulation. Regular exercise and care
: ful diet are very necessary. Take hot
footbaths at night and use diluted witch
hazel as an external application. A paste
which can be put on at night will take the
redness away, It is made by taking one
tablespoonful of glycerine and two tea
spoonfuls of water and adding enough
prepared chalk to make a paste.
CONFIDENCEâ Don't lose courage, lit
tle girl. The blackheads are most per
sistent things, but you can certainly an
nihilate them with that brush and the
rest of it. Just keep it up. that's all. You
can purchase the ingredients called for
in the cold cream and make it yourself,
although you may find it a bit trouble
some; or you can carry the recipe to a
druggist and have him put it up for you.
Smear it all over the face and well down
on the neck. There is no necessity to rub
it over the eyelids. After you have rubbed
it well in and, the skin has absorbed all
that it will, remove what remains with. a
soft cloth. The pumice stone that you
I have is right. Just rub it over the arms
night and morning. Mind, this will not
remove the hairs for good and all. It
will merely keep them worn down to the
surface of the skin. They will return,
and may come in a trifle coarser than
before. I very much prefer the peroxide
of hydrogen treatment myself. I would
not advise the acetic acid unless. you are
perfectly positive the brown spots are
moles. It would be wise to consult a der
matologist. Equal parts of vaseline and
cocoanut oil melted together and applied
to the eyelashes will make them grow.
But you must be careful not to get it
in the eyes. The following lavender lo
tion is delightful for softening the water:
Alcohol, -4 ounces; ammonia, 1 ounce; oil
of lavender, one dram. Mix by shaking
in a six-ounce bottle and do not use more
than one teaspoonful of this to two quarts
of warm water when the face is bathed.
BERTHA LITTLEâ Cocoa cream will
whiten and soften the hands. Try it and
see. It is made by melting together equal
parts of cocoa butter and oil of sweet
almonds and refined white wax.
SUSIE COSTELLO.â The acid is to be
applied but once a day for three days.
If used oftener a scar is likely to result.
A scab will form which, in the course of
a couple of weeks, will drop off, taking the
mole with it.

TWO MILES A MINUTE ON A SINGLE RAIL.
... / ' -
Remarkable .Achievement on a j*leW Electric Railroad Near Brussels With Gars Built on an Entirely
J^leW Planâ England Is Building One
Special to the Sunday Call.
WHILE railroad operators are
boasting of making their sixty
miles an hour an English in
ventor has quietly built a line
of railroad on which the trains
run regularly at the rate of
a hundred miles an hour, and frequently
attain a speed of from two. to three miles
a minute. And it is a practical achieve
ment, with full-sized cars capable of
carrying a. hundred passengers .-ach, so
practical, indeed, that F. B. Behr, the en
gineer and inventor, has just formed a
syndicate In London for constructing a
line on his new system between Liverpool
and Manchester. He calls it, very truly,
the "Lightning Express Railway." It will
regularly make the distance of about
thirty miles in twenty minutes, includ
ing stops. Between stations the cars will
frequently attain a speed of two miles a
minute.
The character of the new road is as
strange as its achievements. The trains
run on a single rail set several feet
above ground on a trestle-work, and the
motive power is furnished by electricity.
The cars somewhat resemble a big ob
long bun, turned ' upside down, with
wheels set thick along the part that
answers for the bun crease, and hedged
about with guide wheels, so that It can
not jump the track along which it ls pro
pelled.
Wonders of the New Road.
Work on the Liverpool and Manchester
road will begin within a few months. The
first line of the -kind built by Mr. Behr,
in Tervuerne, near Brussels, Belgium,
has been in operation for some months,
nnd has been found to be remarkably suc
cessful. It crosses bridges and roads,
lt circles around short curves, it climbs
steep grades. It enters and leaves its
depots by means of what are probably
the most curious switch arrangements in
the world, and it gives Its passengers a
new sensationâ a sensation of a speed of
propulsion hitherto unattained in any
contrivance Invented by man for the
transportation of passengers.
Indeed, it Is said that the curious
lengthwise arrangement of the seats. with
in the cars was to prevent the full effect
of the appearance of swiftness on the
passengers. Mr. Behr says that a man

sides, joined by curved ends, the curves
having a radius of 1600 feet. The track
proper is a stout trestle laid upon ground
sleepers. On top of the trestle, there is
the single bearing rail, and at either side
of it. lower down, a guide rail. *
How the Road Is : Constructed.
That is. not so very wonderful, but
you cannot say so much of the car itself.
It is a sort of double-decker, sixty feet
long, and dual lengthwise as well as ver
tically', throughout its lower half. This
double lower portion houses the main
wheels, the guide wheels, and the elec
tric motors, which receive their power
from a conductor laid along the track.
There are four of these motors, weighing
three tons each. They are attached to four
of the eight carriage wheels. With GOO
revolutions per- minute each motor devel
ops 150 horsepower* That gives a speed
of a hundred miles an hour, which can
easily be doubled.
Besides the eight carriage wheels there
are thirty-two guide wheels, which run
upon the guide rails and preserve the
equilibrium. Thus even at three miles
a minute there is no possibility of de
railment.
Tho upper half, the car proper, seats 100
passengers, and has besides compart
ments for the electrician and conductor.
In the electrician's cabin there are two
air brakes, one for slacking speed, the
other for actually stopping the train.
Electricity comes from a power-house
in the Tervuerne park, which has a ca
pacity of about 1000 horsepower. The
dynamos have a working strength of 750
volts. Electricity is fed to the line by a
copper cable properly connected to the

steel contact rail, which' is carried on
china insulators, made fast to the sleep
ers. This contact rail feeds especial col
lectors, which in turn pass the power to
the motors.
This line has narper curves and
steeper gradients than are likely to oc
cur on any commercial railway. And it
has itself been most severely and impar
tially tested under the eyes of commis
sioners specially appolnted'by the Gov
ernments of Belgium and Russia. So it
is worth while to hear what those big-wig
official gentlemen say of lt:
"A single-rail line, on trestles, with a
bearing surface for the vertical pressure
of the rolling stock, and supplied with
guide wheels to resist lateral pressure, of
fers fewer chances of derailment than the
ordinary railway," says one. â¢ A second
comes in like an echo: "A' single-rail line
with curves of the radius common upon
express routes can be traveled over much
more rapidly and more safely than an or
dinary track."
Curiosities of the New Line. t
One of the curiosities of the Ter
vuerne line is . the method of crossing
country roadwaj*s, of which there are
several through the park at Tervuerne.
In order to maintain such a speed it
would be fatal to have to slow down for
a crossing. Accordingly, Mr. Behr has
rigged up a marvelous â  drawbridge for
roads. This drawbridge is worked auto
matically, so that when the train ap
proaches the two sections' of the bridge,
parting in the middle, fly up, allowing the
train to pass at full speed.
Mr. Behr expects in the future to use
his new invention not onlj* for short dis
tances between densely populated cities,
but for long distances through the coun
try where the passenger traffic is large.
If his line now projected from Liverpool
to Manchester is entirely satisfactorj*.
think of the possibilities for still longer
ones! For instance, a traveling man
might go to bed in the evening in a train
in New York and wake up fresh for busi
ness in Chicago the next morning. It
would be perfectly feasible to go to Flor
ida for a Sunday's outing, leaving Satur
day night and coming back on Monday
morning, and, according to Mr. Behr. this
could be accomplished with even greater
safety than that attained in the swift
running double-track trains of to-day.
Cost of Single Rail Lines.
The question of cost, of outlay â  and
possible returns, is of course . crucial.
Mr. Behr is frankness itself there. He
sets down categorically estimates of
first cost at from $50,000 to $100,000 to the
Palmistry
50 many thousand impressions of

mile, but asserts that the operating ex
penses are so moderate that the single
rail lines can carry passengers at a less
rate than is now charged upon fast trains
and still pay. dividends upon their capital.
He says, too, that he sees no likelihood
of interfering with freight traffic, nor
even of monopolizing the passenger busi-
ness. What he advises is the construc
tion of single-rail systems along some" of
the great trunk lines, possibly in connec
tion with them, so that impatient travel
ers, or timid- ones, or those under stress
of business, may be whisked away as by
magic, leaving the Pullmans and vesti
bule trains to those who have luck and
leisure. .
Evolution of the Single Rail.
The genesis of this Tervuerne line is most
interesting. It is as much an evolution
as it may work a revolution. Various and
sundry other single-rail lines have ex
ited in various and sundry parts of the
world. Some ran by mule power, some
by steam power. The Tervuerne line is,
however, the first to run by harnessed
lightning. Its immediate prototype is the
single-rail trestle line running from Lls
towel to Ballybrennan, in Ireland; which
is in itself somewhat notable.' Its length
is nine miles and a half, it has run for
eleven years odd, without having a car
wheel once leave the track or a passen
ger or employe make a claim against
it for damages. Tills, though it is ope
rated by steam and runs twenty miles an
hourâ an astounding rate of speed,
but a very sufficient one, under the cir
! cumstances. :
Mr. Behr built it, as later he built the
Belgian experimental line. The Listowel
model was a line put up by a French en
gineer out in Algeria. At first he built
a double track line on the ground, but
the sandstorms covered up his tracks,
faster than he could uncover them, so he
had recourse to trestle construction along
which cars were drawn by mules after
the manner of boats on a canal. Happen
ing to see it, Mr. Bohr-decided that it was
a good scheme, and proceeded to imitate
It upon the Irish coast. From steam and
twenty miles an. hour the transition has
been more natural than rapid. He has
gone slowlj- and surely to the end, that
later he might be as sure of helping the
world to go very fast. .
Possibilities of the Invention.
Speculation is idle, but prospects such
as these invite it. Single-rail lines may
help-to solve many social problems. For
one thing it is evident that they put the
flying machine out of court for at least
a century. Two or three miles a minute
is faster than -flight, save indeed the flight
of wild swans and reed birds. Seed birds
have been, shot in New England with
crops, full of Carolina rice, which they \
must have pilfered less than eight hours i
before. The coast line is something like
sixteen hundred milesâ hence it appears
that the swiftest of all feathered things j
barely equal the speed* of the new elec- j
trie car. '

-- AST Sunday a curious ceremony
was" performed as a finishing touch
LAST Sunday a curious ceremony
wa~ performed as a finishing touch
to the rebuilding of the Lambertus
church, one of the finest examples
_ .__/ of pure Gothic in Germany. Those
three "man-high" iron cages that
have hung from the great tower since
1537 were hoisted up anew to a height
of three hundred and twenty-five feet In
order that the sentence of the ancient
Bishop's court be carried out, which read:
"And there, on the highest point in Mun
sterland, they shall hang forever and
ever, as a warning to evil-doers from now
on until judgment day."
' These cages were the prisons in which
the world-renowned Anabaptists. John
Van Leyden, "King of the Universe," as
he called himself; his chancellor, Krecht-
Ing, and his governor and lord high exe
cutioner, Knipperdolling, spent the last
six months of their lives, and that served
them, or what was left of them, for cof
fins after death.
There were some skulls and fragments
of bones in two cages, and instruments
of torture in all of them. The Bishop's
court had decreed: "We give your flesh
to the birds and your bories to the winds
that rage above, so they may carry par
ticles of your cursed bodies to all parts
of the earth," but the winds had not fin
ished their work a year ago. Two skulls
were left, a broken and battered leg bone,
and odd pieces of ribs and fingers, the
latter having caught and being stuck fast
in some of the crevices.
Professor Joseph Bautz of the Munster
Ecclesiastical University has prepared a
long paper on the almost forgotten his
tory of the Anabaptists. This will be pub
lished on the occasion of the raising of
the cages. These passages are quoted
from the Interesting document:

news of the reformation, had been in a

LADIES OF THE MACCABEES.
Mission Hive No. 8, Ladies of the Mac
cabees, ha? instituted a series of Monday
afternoon meetings for the purpose of
promoting sociability among the members.
These meetings will be held on the fourth
Monday afternoon of each month. The
first was given on the last Monday in Feb
ruary, and under good of the order the
doors were opened to Invited guests. Tho
afternoon was pleasantly spent, ; several
instrumental numbers were rendered by
Lady Minnie Shule and. others, and it was.
running the city and coun
try. . Chief among them
was John of Lej-den, a
tailor by trade, and a man
of dignified presence, beau
tiful of face, eloquent
and magnetic. He soon
achieved wonderful popu
; larity in Munster, the wo
men especially- worshiping
I him as the new Messiah.
"On February 27, 1534,
during a stormy night,
John placed himself at the
head of a numerous mob
and compelled .all citizens,,
who did not subscribe to
Anabaptism to leave their
houses and run for their
lives. The Bishop and his
soldiers had left the pre
vious day to unite with
the Hessians that were on
the way to Munster. The
city now being 'in his
hands. John declared him
! self King. He ordered the
gates closed - and manned
the walls and - fortifica
tions with his fanatic fol
lowers. Then he decreed,
under assistance of the
Ministers, that all gold
and silver be . brought to
his palace to be at the dis
posal of the common
wealth.
"Next he set up a so
called Christian co-opera
tive â  community, with
twelve apostles as gover
nors. Goods and chattels
I were equally divided
I among the citizens, who
| also participated in pleas
! ure and work in equal
I shares, the King, however,
! reserving for himself one
< hundredth part of every
i thing of riches, real estate
and women. Two years
: of the wildest orgies fol
lowed. John ordered that
everything high he low
ered, and the church stee
pies were, in consequence,
demolished, platforms be
| ing substituted, on which
I John planted cannons
I which worked great loss
of life to the Bishop's be
; sieging army. A little
| later John declared him
self 'King of the Uni
verse,* appointing another
set of apostles, whom hÂ»
sent out of the city to
preach. Of course the
Bishop caught these fel
lows and promptly hanged
them in the face 'of John
and his troopers, who
stood on the city walls
watching the progress of
their brother Anabaptists.
"As it happened, there
were six times more wo
men in Munster than men,
religious fanaticism hav
ing caused the wives and
daughters of the neighbor
ing districts to leave their
horiies in droves to join
the Anabaptists. So King
John decreed polygamy
'after the example of Ab
raham, David and Solo
mon.' For himself he
took seventeen wives, sev
eral of which were after
ward beheaded by him in
the open market place.
"Meanwhile the besieg
ing army made little prog
ress. The -Munster wo
men, men and boys proved
equally courageous de
fenders of the Holy
Realm. The Bishop's sol
diers were defeated num
bers of times, and .King
John led his troops in
many successful battles
outside the gates. But
what neither prowess not
strategy could achieve
hunger worked slowly but
surely. Bread riots mul
tiplied in the city, and
John's measures in the
long run were unable to
break -the spirit of insur
rection, though his execu
tioners sometimes cut' oft
as many as sixty heads a
day. Finally one of John
own guards led 400 Epis
copal soldiers into the city
on a dark night. They
succeeded in opening one
of the gates, and 5000
more followed. The Ana
baptists, men and women
alike, though unnerved by
hunger, fought like tigers.
The slaughter lasted twenty-four hours,
until all that carried arms were
lying dead in the streets or houses, the
Anabaptists' last stand being made in the
voted a great success. The committee
served refreshments. Lady Henrietta
Stone is now the lady commander of the
hive. â  yyyy::
THE DRUIDS.
Last Sunday the grand officers paid an
official -visit to Aurora Grove at Mission
Parlor Hall. The meeting was one of the
largest Druidic gatherings ever held in a
grove In this city, there being at least 250
members of the order present. The work
of conferring the second degree was per
formed in a most satisfactory manner by
the team from Galileo Grove. At . the
close of the official investigation there
was an excellent banquet. The date being
the second anniversary of the Institution
of the grove, there was a ball until mid
night. The affair from beginning to end
was well arranged and well carried out.
Much of the credit for this has been ac
corded to Past Arch C. Gugllelmona, who
at the banquet was toastmaster.
Last Monday night the members of
Pleasanton Grove were surprised by a
number of visitors from Livermore Grove.
The second and third degrees were con
ferred- after which there was a collation.

During ', the visit of the San Francisco
Cabinet to El Dorado Council last week
the National Union quartet was tendered
a vote of thanks for having volunteered
its services for that evening. It added
much to the beautiful ceremony by the
rendition in . its usual admirable manner
of the incidental music. Superior Judge
George H. Bahrs, who is a member of the
council, during the evening delivered an
city hall, from the windows of which their
bodies were thrown upon the lances of the
troopers watching below."
As the Bishop had ordered. King John,
Knipperdolling-and Krechting were taken
alive, the first in his royal robes made of
cloth of gold. John preserved a digni
fied demeanor. When the Bishop asked
him, "Who gave thee power over the
people?" the King answered, "Who gave
thee thine?"
"I was elected Bishop."
"And I," said John, "am King by tha
choice and the grace of God."
According to Dr. Bautz. John and his
Ministers were next placed before the
Bishop's court and innumerable crimes
were proved against them. The sentence
decreed that the three men be "thrown
into cages and carried around the coun
try, to be exhibited like wild animals."
The people, said the sentence, should
not be deterred from injuring the prison

â¦ â  - : â  â¦ â¢RING UP THE CURTAIN
FOR THE OPERA, MR. ELLIS
TO put it enthusiastically, the town
has gone opera mad. Everybody
seems to be talking* about and
waiting for to-morrow night's
opening; and though the week
â¢just over offered no less than six new
show bills the theaters did only feather
weight business. Even the success of
a new star, that was so generally cele
brated in last Tuesday's newspapers,
turned out to be what the manager
would call only an artistic success. The
Columbia has not been a populous place
these recent nights notwithstanding the
fact that a,t the Monday opening Miss
Walsh convinced a frigid audience and
the skeptical critics that she is an
actress of artistic importance. The an
ticipatory spirit of frivolity and fashion
is in the air; the popular fancy turns
operaward; preparations, even econo
mies, must be mad. against the coming
of Melba and the Ellis Company. Tho
regular theaters have had to suffer the
lull that precedes the operatic storm.
Such is the fortune of the theatrical
business in a city of this size. Popular
Interest has concentrated in the opera.
The season Is short, only twelve per
formances, and it was the promise of
this concentrated interest that induced
Mr. Ellis to bring the company. The
smaller theaters may be more or less
neglected for a few nights, but, as I
have said here on many a previous
Sunday, they will prosper by it in the
long run. The people are reawaking
to the joys of the playhouse*, the aver
age attendance is better than it ha*"
been in years; and the thousands of
dollars that we spend on the Ellis Com
pany will bring good value in adver
tising in all the important managerial
offices of the world. New York enjoys
better opera than any of the capitals
of Europe because she pays the biggest
price for it. Modern operatic produc
tions are first of all for the rich and
reckless. The salaries are fabulous.
Even the crackerjack vaudevillian must
blush for his wage in the presence of
an opera artist. America has taught
these singers how much they are worth
--or rather, how much they can get.
About the only inducement that Amer
ica offers to the European artist is cold,
hard cash. As long as we have plenty
of that we will have the pick of the
world. Such is our doom and pride.
The opera houses in most of the cities
of Europe are, to a certain extent,
maintained as public art institutions,
where none are too poor to go and do
their reverence. The average European
knows as much about good opera as the
average American knows about bad
newspapers. But with our persuasive
American gold we have seduced the
world's greatest singers to our shores,
until to-day the Czar of Russia, the
Emperor of Germany, thÂ» Prince of
Wales and the -usurers of Paris must
wait the closing of the New York sea
son before they have the chance to
bravo and bejewel their favorite warb
lers. Opera comes high in America, and
that is not the least of its fascination.
Opera may not be the highest form of
musical and dramatic expression, but
it certainly is a beautiful, even esthetic
amusement,- and cannot be without its
refining influence on our rich. It is
only a question of time when our opu
lent gentry will conclude that a box
at the opera is something better than
a frivol and a dissipation. New York
has developed wonderfully in the last
decade. In fact the judgment of that
city on a new opera or a new singer is
almost final. Not only has the poor but
passionate music lover in the gallery
acquired taste and discrimination, but
the multi-millionaire box-holder has
learned to be seen and not heard and
sit up and take notice. As long as the
Americans keep their genius for mak
ing and spending money America will
continue to be the impresario's Klon
dike. Of course this lavish importation
is something of a drawback to the de
velopment of native talent, but that is
another and an old story. We who lead
the world in so many ways as producers
are still but patrons in the older walks
of art. But out of this liberal patron
age culture Is bound to spring. Already
we have turned out some of the greatest
singersâ if, indeed, these have had to
adopt foreign names and receive for
eign educationâ there is a hope that
out of our growing . appreciation will
come that general musical feeling, at
mosphere, which breeds composers. But
I have argued away from the subject
in hand, which is the opening of the
Ellis season in the Grand Opera-house
to-morrow night. During this season
we will not have to deal with the diffi
culties of new composers. The one new
work in the repertory is Puccini's "La
Boheme," and we were made acquaint
ed with the beauties of that opera be
fore Melba was. The other pieces are
the old familiars. All that we have to
do is listen to the good singing and the
good orchestra, wear our finest and be
happy. Thanks to a willing people and
a willing press and the indefatigable
Mr. Strine, who has managed for Mr.
Ellis, the pecuniary fortunes of the sea
t-on are assured. The sale has been tre
mendous. We have arranged the pre
liminaries up to the most sanguine fore
casts. All that remains is for Mr. Ellis
to ring up the curtain and do the rest.

a A new star in the dramatic firmament
shone forth with remarkable brilliancy
and splendor at the Columbia Theater
during the past week. Blanche Walsh
has at last arrived, and the Indications
are that she has come to stay. She has
long been an actress of unusual promise,
but many an actress gives promise of
greatness to whom the fitting opportunity
never comes. Miss Walsh found her op
portunity in "La Tosca" and took full ad
vantage of it, establishing by the per
formances her right to stellar aspirations
and high histrionic honors. The last per
formance of "La Tosca" will be given to
n Beginning Monday night another of the
famous Sardou plays. "Fedora "will be
presented, with Miss Blanche Walsh in
the title role and Mr. Melbourne Mac-
Dowel! in his character of Louis Ipanoff.
Like nearly all of the plays of Sardou,
"Fedora" depends largely upon two prom
inent characters, around whom the whole
story is closely woven and In whom the
interest almost wholly centers.
The Bostonians follow in "Rob Roy.

An excellent drama of modern life will
be played this week by the Alcazar Com

A number of extra strong turns are

among the biggest novelties ever seen

merit of their work is in the. ease and
trace with which, they execute the- most
difficult feats; even their contortion work
is done so easily and gracefully as to be
nttractive to the eye. Another new card
is the Troubadour Trio, who advertise
themselves as the "greatest novelty sing

This Is yrtiat Charles E. Nixon of the
Chicago Inter Ocean has to say about the
boom for stock companies throughout the
West: "The revival of the old stock sys
tem is naturally in accord with the eco- j
nomic tendency of the tiroesâ the de- I
mands for cheaper forms of entertain
ment. There are more theaters than
there are attractions, and the men who
own the theaters have been in a measure
forced to create entertainment or have
their houses remain dark. The prevail
ing taste far vaudeville has left a host of
minor actors Idling in the gloaming, while
the theatrical syndicate largely controls
the high class and high priced attractions,
the field of production, and encourages
long runs. These are the current condi
tions that militate against the lesser cities
getting the novelties in the higher lines of
theatrical production. The stock system
certainly has Its virtues for those cities
where half a loaf Is better than none, and j
really deserves encouragement. The local
companies are doing good work in this
city and the dcctrine of protection is cer. j
tainly a good one to apply to this species j
of artistic industry." i
Pretty soon Chicago will produce a man j
who will be able to convince his towns- |
man that he wrote the plays of* Shake

cago newspaper man, who says that sev
eral years ago he submitted a play by
the name of "Congress" to Nat Goodwin,
which was afterward produced under the
title of "Ambition," with. Henry Guy
Carleton named as author, has sued Mr.
Goodwin for 160,000 damages and secured
a verdict for $10,000. The name of the
young newspaper "man is John JMilo Max
well.
The decision on the merits of the two
plays was made, it is said, before a vote
was taken on the question of piracy. On
this question the vote of the jury was
also unanimous, a's was also the vote on
the amount of the award. Without being
In the bast puffed up by the victory Mr.
Maxwell feels that the opinion of twelve
men in a jury box on the merits alone of
the two productions is entitled to as much
consideration as the judgment of dramat
ic critics.
It was while on a vacation In Wiscon
sin in 1594 that Mr. Maxwell evolved the
plot around which he constructed his
play entitled "Congress." The actual work
of writing it consumed about four months'
time. It was submitted to Goodwin while
that actor was stopping at the Auditori
um and remained in his hands for a week.
Goodwin rejected the play on the excuse
that it dealt too much with the labor
question. Mr. Maxwell is going to write
another play, now that he has emerged
from the darkness of obscurity under
such favorable circumstances. He feels
elated, naturally, over the fact that he
has suffered .nothing in comparison by the
side of that successful playwright, Henry
Guy Carleton, and argues that a second
effort will receive at least consideration
at the hands of the critics.
The remarks of Israel Zangwill continue
to stir the waters. The Chicago Dial co
incides with Mr. Zangwill's views; in
some particulars going deeper into, causes
and conditions than even the noted lec
turer. In the concluding portions of its
article on the subject the Dial makes use
of the following:
"In literature the finest forms of art are
accessible to everybody. This statement
is also measurably true of music and
painting and sculpture. One can, to a
considerable extent, come to understand
the ideals of these arts by the study of
photographs and scores. At all events,
the large cities afford actual examples of
the highest achievements of these arts.
But even the large cities rarely, if ever,
afford to the. spectator examples of what
the art dramatic at Its highest can do.
They may show us marvelous stage ef
fects, but they do not show us sincerity
of purposes and unity of artistic endeav
or. In this respect it is true that in Eng
land and America the drama stands upon
a lower level than the other arts. We
can all read the greatest literature at
home; we can often hear the greatest
music perfectly performed; we can view

the Grand: "The, week just closed has
been very interesting to opera-goers. Tho
company assembled by Manager Charles
A. Ellis has had its Introduction to Boston
and its performances have given great
satisfaction. The Boston Theater has
never held more brilliant and critical au
diences and expressions of pleasure have
been nightly heard on all hands in tho
foyer between the acts. The two evenings
devoted to German works have called
out in full force the Wagner adherents,
and Frau Gadski and Herr Kraus have
confirmed anew their positions. The un
fortunate impairment of health which
compelled the â  return home of Ternina
without a hearing in this country Is
deeply regretted for her sake as well as
for selfish reasons, by public and manage
ment alike. â /,-' - -
"Little that is new can be said of Mel
ba. Nevertheless, it has been demon
strated during the past week that she is
not content to rest upon previously
earned laurels, but is. like a true artist,
continually broadening the scope of her
art and reaching toward still higher re
sults. Her enterprise in studying with
Puccini his latest work has found amplo
justification in the pleasure given by the
first performance on Wednesday evening
of "La Boheme," the success of which
has surpassed all records of flrst nights.
De Lussan has found a well earned wel
come from old friends and new admirers.
Both Bonnard and Pandolfini, the new
tenors, have shown themselves good ar
tists in their different lines, and the other
singers introduced by Mr. Ellis have fully
justified their selection. In short, the
Ellis opera company is an organization
on which management and public may
well be congratulated."
William Gillette has nearly finished
; his dram:ti**ation of A. Conan Doyle's in-
I teresting "Sherlock Holmes" stories. The
! play will be produced early next season.
The Gray Felt Hat.
; What a queer thing is our soldier hat!
i Who ever dreamed of a tile like that
To deck the head of a soldier boyâ'
The battle's hero and the artist's joy!
Where are the feathers, buttons and braid
Wherein our forces were once arrayedâ
The gay kepi, the bearskin cap.
The fancy helmet and jingling strap?
Gone where the woodbine used to twine â
Gone like the rout that broke the line â
Like the Spanish fleetsâ or last year's
snows â .
Gone where all the rubbish goes!
For the Yankee to-day is a practical man.
Who goes to war on a practical plan.
The militant Yankee's plain felt hat
Looks odd; but it doesn't roof a flat.
Do you remember, in sixty-one,
', When the late unpleasantness was begun.
i The togs that were* worn? What a mas
querade!
I A Target Excursion on parade-
Big Zouave .breeches, gilt tasseled boots,
Silkfrogged jackets, rainbow suits! .â -.
But those lads saw fightingâ bled and
died,
And learned to put fuss and feathers
aside.
There's something rather businesslike
In that dull gray slouch without a spike;
It's warm against the winter's snows;
It keeps the sun from eyes and nose.
And, wet or dry. it's devil-may-care,
With a very taking bulldog air.
You may poke it up or flatten it out.
Roll it, stretch it or throw it about;
In fact, it's a rough-and-ready hat.
The Yankee himself, for the matter of
that,
Is much the same, when it comes to style,
As his simple, useful, capable tile. y-''
He marches and fights in a "glt-thar"
way.
And where he lights he's safe to stay.
Rifle shooting's his national game f ;.>â¢',
On land or sea, it's all the same.
And a German helmet or Russian cap
Or French contraption with a fancy strap.
Or any other foreign faker
AVill find, if it runs against this Quaker,

DEARTH OF LUMBER.
DEALERS DECLARE THAT THERE WAS
NEVER BEFORE SUCH A SCARCITY.
The New York Commercial says: "According
to lumbermen there has never been such a
dearth of material within their recollections.
Hard wood has never been so scarce, and prices
consequently are away up. The demand is
good and Is Increasing as spring approaches,
but the low stocks cannot satisfy the demand.
This remarkable advance in prices all along
a; this season produces the feeling that new
stock will be amply provided for by the con
stantly Increasing demand. '. â  '- -' .
"The Government's order for 2;>. 000,000 feet
of pine has nearly cleared the market, and,
considering that all this timber would have
come to this section of the country, It affects
the local market to a considerable extent. The
pine timber ls used by the Government for the
erection of barracks, etc., for United States
troops in Cuba. Â» j "' .L " -' '
"Speculation Is rife among dealers whether,
the next few months will see enough hard wood
to relieve the situation, and many dealers carry'
low stocks with this hope in view. The hard
-wood wholesalers have exhausted all means of
getting stock and are Compelled to cancel or
ders dÂ«y after day. Many of the pine mills in
North Carolina suffered from the recent storms
considerably ' and had to suspend operations
for a time. " - : -.
"The demand for pine is good and the mills
are filled with orders at increased prices. While
the price of lumber among the wholesale deal
ers has Increased considerably the retail price
is the same, and many contractors who. have
figured on contracts two or three months ago
will find that they will have to pay considerable
more than they have bargained for." .';..: .

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK . MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 11.â Quotations on the
Stock Exchange left off fractionally above yes
terday* close and near the highest. The trad
ing at the outset was of a hesitating charac- j
ter, showing a disposition to follow any move
in the specialties. This was Indicated by a
rise in sugar, the improvement in this stock
canceling the earlier decline. The general mar
ket moved sympathetically, but narrowly. Sub
sequently there was a' raid on Metropolitan
Street Railway, which dropped 5 points. This
incident stimulated short sales on the other
stocks, with concessions quite material in
Manhattan, Brooklyn Transit, Sugar and Bay
State Gas. The latter was particularly in
fluenced by the action of the Boston Exchange
authorities in discontinuing trading in the
stock. This action was subsequently taken by
the governors at the local exchange. The rail
way shares moved very sluggishly and attempts
to improve them were retarded by the heavi
ness of Union Paciflc issues, ln which foreign
selling was quite pronounced. Various pessi
mistic expressions as to the probable character
of the bank statement which had been rife
during the week were partially. eradicated when
the statement was published. The salient fea
ture of it was a contraction in surplus reserve
of only $1,375,125. The loan account showed a
reduction of over $3,000,000. Cash decreased
$4,413,000, which reflected sub-treasury . opera
tions In connection with the Central Pacific set
tlement. The statement was received with
considerable favor in the street, and induced
active buying, raising ' the general level of
prices above last night. The closing was
strong and active.
The stock' speculation for the week was
largely of a professional character, with sales
about a million less than those of the pre
vious week. p While stocks showing advances
were more numerous than those figuring for
I declines, gains registered in the railways were
In obscure properties, the general run of ac
tive shares, particularly the Grangers and Pa
cifies, losing ground. Owing to the unusual
prominence and support ex.tended to the spe
cialties during the week, many of these prop
erties show handsome gains. â  A flurry in the
call money market ln which- quotations for a
time reached 4%, was largely due to the
financing of the Central Pacific settlement with
the Government, the Chicago and Alton deal
and various industrial combinations. The
money to pay the Cuban troops had no effect
on the money market, as lt was withdrawn
from the Sub-Treasury. A large amount of
country bank balances reached New York be
cause of the firmness in the money rates, and
there were arrivals of round amounts of gold
from the Pacific Coast, and money gradually
eased off from its high level. While money
Was in particular demand, there appeared a re
flex easing in sterling exchange, which again
strengthened, and money became easier.
The bond market followed the tendency of
stock prices pretty closely. The market as a
whole showed a very substantial undertone and
some striking gains were recorded in the usu
ally active bonds. â¢ :â¢â 'â â

CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO. March 11.â The 198,000,000 bushels
of wheat ln farmers' hands In .this country
March 1, as reported by the Government, was a
good deal more than the national . bureau ex
pected to acknowledge . and 27,000,000 bushels
in excess of the record-breaking total of ' 1892.
The Liverpool market was affected to the ex
tent of a decline in wheat futures of j%d and
Paris noted declines oX from 306*0 centimes a
bushel. Under such ' conditions May wheat
started here %Â®l%c lower at from 69%Â®69%c
down to 69% c and the market became heavy,
May getting down to 69c in the course of an
hour from the opening. A vast quantity of
long wheat was sold out and an equal amount
of shorts were covered, the readiness with
which the holders of the latter contracts ac
cepted the offerings being the only thing that
prevented a more furious decline. The world s
shipments during the week were estimated at
about 8,000,000 bushels, . half of which came
from this country. . The general expectation
regarding the visible supply statement was for
some Increase. Near the end of the session
May recovered from 69c to 69% c and closed at
69%@69%c. .:y,..'tr:f .-â "â .
. The Government figures on corn reserves of
800,000,000 bushels was a surprise, as it had
been expected the matter would be less than
last year's. Longs became dtsgusted and sold
out. The market ruled heavy throughout, with
shorts buying at the decline. May lost %c.
The weakness of wheat and* corn caused a de
cline in oats. â â â  There was general liquidation
and every drop in prices brought out selling or
ders. May closed %c lower. â  ' ' _
Provisions were remarkably steady. Buying
by packers and better prices for hogs, were the
strengthening influences. Pork closed with a
loss of 5c and lard and ribs 2%65c lower.

RTHUR struggled
long and bravely with
the quicksand that
threatened to swal
low him. He made
little headway, how
ever, and the sand
would have buried
him, I think, if he
had not been as bold
as he was persever-
Ing. Across the desert
came a great snake. It heard the noise
that Arthur was making, and, thinking
to get a breakfast, drew near to the
quicksand. Hardly had the newcomer
touched the quicksand when it saw its
own danger and tried to retreat. Being
very long its body rested upon the solid
land on either side, therefore it was
able to get away. Arthur saw it glid
ing away and took a desperate chance.
Seizing the snake around its wriggling
body he held stoutly on and was drawn
out of the quicksand, but found him
self in a new danger, for the snake was
very angry.
Arthur's strength was now so far
spent that he could not battle. His
fate was, he thought, to escape from
the quicksand only to he devoured by
a snake. He was saved because the
snake was not really very hungry just
then. Thinking that Arthur could not
escape, in his weak condition, the
enemy coiled itself up in front of Ar
thur and lay there to rest, keeping its
eyes fixed upon him all the time.
How long would this last? Arthur
tried to steal away, but the snake
moved, too, and Arthur saw that he
was in great trouble.
There came into view just then a
caravan. Arabs and others riding upon
camels. At the sound of the camels'
bells the snake ran away. â¢â â â -â 'â¢y
"What now, comrade?" asked an
Arab, as he saw Arthur lying on -.the
sand.
"I am sick and in trouble. Let- me
ride in your caravan and I will pay
you well. I am Arthur, son of the good
King."
' "You shall ride if you have thirty
rolls of silver."
"Alas," said Arthur, "I. have no sil
ver; but my father, the King, will give
you even sixty rolls of silver â yes and
as .many of gold if you will befriend
me." -.â  .... . -â¢*
"A great story, truly," said the Arab.
"No; I have no room for you."
Arthur saw the caravan get ready to
move on. He begged that they would
let him go with them, but the. Arabs
mocked him. "A pretty story it is,"
the leader of the caravan said, "but
who knows whether it is true? I fear
that, in these days of magic, when hon
est camel drivers are likely to be be
witched by strangers of whom they
know nothing you will find it hard to
find any one who will take you out of
the desert unless you can tell a story
more easy to believe to explain how j-ou
happen to be here."
With that, in great haste, the coward
ly Arab ordered the caravan to start
and left Arthur to make his own. way
out or to die, as it might happen.
Arthur tried to follow the caravan, but
the camels were urged to run and he
was soon alone once more in the wilder
ness of sand hills, all of which looked
so alike that he could not tell which
SI MACCARD
AND WILLIE
BY MIRIAM LANE,
PORTLAND, OR.
THE silence of the morning hour In
â¢' the school was broken "by a
sound which caused all the chil
dren to look in the direction of
Si ..laggard's desk. Si was the
largest and the most mischievous boy
In the district. The school was in the
country; Si appeared to be the only
one in the whole sc. 00l at that- minute
who was paying Strict attention to his
hooks. This confirmed the children in
their first thought that Si was un to
some sort of mischief for he was al
ways seeming to study just when he
had a prank to play.
Right behind Si -sat'- Willie Edwards,
a cripple, who had never been known
to do any wrong act in school. Si was
Willies friend and *i " fought many -a
battle with the larger '..o; : in Willies
behalf. While the children were look
ing at ' "i. they were .surprised to see
a pair of pigeons flutter from Willies
lunch basket and begin a flight around
the room.'
* .Mr. Lawton. the teacher, was out of
the room for a moment. .When he Re
turned, he was. astounded to find all
the boys, and a few of the larger girls
pour Animals and One Tree-
engaged in a wild romp, as it appeared
to him. he not seeing at onco the pig
eons which the children â  were chasing.
The entrance of the teacher was enough
to sober, the childrenâ all except Si,* who
was just throwing his jacket at the
birds to scare them* from a picture
frame, that he might seize them. - .** .
"Silas," said the teacher severely,
"what does this all mean? I step from
the room a minute and my back is
no sooner turned than I find you get
ting the children into an uproar. Silas,
come up here." .. ,*Â»,âââ¦
Si went to the teacher's .esk. without
saying a -word. The teacher took from
His desk a long rattan and told Si to
hold out his right hand. Still. Si made
no excuse or defense. He was pun
ished auite severely, but did not whim
way to go.
As he followed after the caravan aÂ»
well as he was able he saw lying in the
sand a roll of paper, written all over
with strange looking marks. This he
picked up. At first. he could not read
the marks, but, as he turned the pages,
he came to one that had the following
on it: . "... . .
"THE WISDOM OF SEELIM, THE
MAGICIAN OF BABYLON."
You may be, sure that Arthur looked
at the marks carefully then. While he
was studying the leader of the caravan
came back to find the roll, which he had
lost.
"Friend," he began gently, "have you
seen a roll of paper on the sand?"
"Is this the roll?" asked Arthur, hold
ing it up, but out of the reach of the
Arab.
"Yes; give it to me quickly, for I
must go upon my way."
"Not so fast," said Arthur. "I find
that this is the Book of the Wisdom of
Seelim â worth its weight in purest gold,
yes, worth the price of a kingdom. It
was Seelim's. You had it and then it
was yours â yours until Seelim could
find it. It is mine now until I can find
Seelim. I will not give it up to any
person except Seelim."
"But Seelim has been dead these
many years."
"Then the roll is mine and I will de
fend my ownership with my life." As
he said this Arthur drew his sword.
Bj* this time other Arabs came run
ning up to help their master.
"See," said Arthur, as he held in one
hand a lighted match and in his other
hand the Roll of Wisdom,, "how easily
this can be destroyed. I will burn it to

ashes unless I have your promise to
take me with your caravan wherever
I will wish to go."
The Arab, who was a magician, was
frightened at the danger to the Wisdom
Roll and so he ordered the best camel
to be given to Arthur, who very wisely
refused to give up the roll until he
should have been carried to the gates
of the Three Kingdoms of Zyk'obar.
At last they came to a range of
mountains, the tops of which were
covered with snow. "Our path lies in
that way," said Arthur, pointing up
ward.
No person had ever lived to cross
these mountains. .
"The mountains" of Gamonasser," so
read the Roll of Wisdom, "are the

his face grew crimson, "is sick. The

POOR MA TTIE
BY B. EVELYN STOUT, .
PLACERVILLE. "" ' :

J I named Adelia Clover, "what shall
OH, dear," sighed a little girl
named Adelia Clover, "what shall
I do to-day?"
ly !â  "Remember to-morrow is your
birthday, dear," said her mother.
"Ye-es, but that hasn't anything to
do with to-day," answered Adelia, "be
sides. I can't have a party like I did
last year, can I?" -
'.. "Adelia," said her mother, "you can
have your choice. You have the money
that Aunt Rachael gave you; you can
do as you please with it. You may have
a nice little party, or do anything:, else
you wish with-it." -y - /
Adelia began to pout. "I don't want
a party unless I can have a nice large
one," she whined. That evening after
supper Adeiia thought of what her
mother had said and of the money her
aunt Rachael had given her. "Only $5.
Yes, have a nice little party, indeed,
with that amount of money!" she said,
scornfully. y-
Then she seemed to see a pale, drawn
face, j A little girl propped up in pil
lows, and she also seemed to hear j the
rub-a-dub-dub of Mattie Kelly's moth
er's* washtub. Then she -thought how
glad Mattie would be to have any kind
of a party. "I wonder if she ever gets
mountains alone.
He saw footprints in the snow that
had been made not long before. So he
knew that a.giant had lately passed
that way. Next he saw a great fire,
in which a dozen whole trees were
burning, far up the mountain side, and
heard the voices of the giants as they
cooked a yellow lion for their break
fast.
Arthur had already decided to seek
the giants as soon as he could. He
managed to get above the giants with
out being seen. Then his first bad
luck came to him. The snow* where
he stepped was slippery. Arthur be
gan to slide down the mountain. In
a struggle to save himself he started
a mass of snow to sliding, which gained
In size. so that when it reached the place
where the giants were it was an ava
lanche. The giants' great fire was put
out; their lion, which was on the spit
cooking, was swept away and went
bounding down the- mountain until it
was lost to view. Arthur went down
with the slide until he came to the
giants' hunting camp, and there he fell
into a huge iron pot which had been
hanging on a crane made of a great
log.
The giants were very cross over the
loss of their .breakfast, but they had
other game. -Half a dozen dead lions
lay upon the ground and there were
also dead elephants that the giants had
killed and brought on their shoulders
up to the camp.
"Ho, ho," said one of the giants as
he pulled Arthur out of the iron pot,
"here is new game for us. Who ever
saw the like before?"
The giants, of whom there were four,
gathered around and looked at Arthur
with much curiosity. They had never
before seen so small a man.
Arthur thought that it would be well
to pretend not to understand them
when they spoke. They asked him
some questions, to all of which in re
sponse he only shook his head.
* The giants quarreled over Arthur.
The one who had found the Prince in
the Iron pot said that he owned the lit
tle man because he had seen him first.
The three other giants said that all
game belonged to them all together.
They, finally agreed upon this.
Arthur listened and learned from
their talk that two giants would start
soon to go to the Three Kingdoms of
Zykobar to carry on their shoulders, to
one of the three Kings, a whole ele
phant as a gift. He also heard them
tell the story of the death of King
Kahtolah, who had been succeeded by
Egbertâ although the giants did .not
know who was now on Kahtolah's
throne. _ _ . .....:.;â  yr
He .also heard them tell the strange
story of how a black dwarf had been
carried away by a Roc while he was
plowing in a field. Arthur was very
happy then, for these happenings 'he
had read about in the Roll of Wisdom.
"If only he could get into the Kingdoms
now," he thought, "it would not be long
before he would be able to find and to
rescue the Lady of the Black Robe.""
The giants talked so eagerly that
they forgot all about Arthur for a time.
When they looked for. him he was gone;
nor could they, for all their searching,
find him. Where was Arthur?
The giants in their fury at having

lonesome?" Adelia asked herself. But
her, conscience told her, "Of course she
doe's."..
Adelia tried to comfort herself by
saying: "Well, if she gets lonesome
that's not my lookout. It's her moth
er's." But still she thought of little
Mattie. She also thought of her own
toys and picture books and of how glad
Mattie would be to own even one of
them. "Well, I- suppose I may go and
see Mattie Kelly and show her one of
my picture books?" Adelia asked her
mother. â¢
Mrs. Clover looked surprised, but an
swered: "Certainly, dear."
So Adelia put on her hat and gloves,
took her favorite picture book and a
bouquet of flowers with her and was
soon at the door of Matties tiny home.
A tired looking woman holding a baby
answered her knock. Adelia stated her
errand. . . -'- ._,
Mrs Kelly said: "So it's Mattie you
want to see? Well, it's powerful glad
she'll be to see you. Come in!"
When Mattie saw Adelia her pale face
lighted up with a smile and. she
stretched out her thin hand.
"I've come to see you, Mattie, said
Adelia, "and here are some flowers."
"Oh thank you," cried Mattie. and
her mother fixed them for her on the
tiny stand by Matties bed.
"Sure, something like that would do
her good, the doctor be after sayin'.
She needs fresh milk, but I am too poor
to buy it." -Â',â
Adelia felt a great lump rising in her
throat, but kept back her tears. "Mrs.
Kelly " she said, "we can let you have
a pint of 'fresh milk each day, I think."
"Can you?" asked Mrs. Kelly. I
should be so glad."
After Adelia had taken her leave and
was home she told her mother of her
promise to Mrs. Kelly.
."All right, dear," her mother an
swered, "and you may help Mattie and
her mother more if you will use your
own money." ' __ .
At first Adelia hesitated. Then she
said' "Mamma, I will," and she did.
She bought for Mrs. Kelly a warm
shawl, a pair of shoes for the baby.
and some stockings and a picture book
and some sweetmeats for Mattie. She
took the articles to Mrs. Kelly early
the next morning and they were ap-

There was a loud pounding at the
gate of the Kingdom of Atrophole, one
of the Three Kingdoms of the black
dwarfs. The King sent his warder to
open the gate and found there two
giants, ' one 'of whom carried an ele
phant and the other a pair of dead
lions on his shoulders.
King Atrophole took the gifts and
sent the giants on their homeward

other person live who was found in the
mountains. They were glad to get
away so easily and hurried off for fear
that they would be turned into mice by
