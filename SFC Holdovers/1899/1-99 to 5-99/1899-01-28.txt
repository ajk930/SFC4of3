CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â Yesterday afternoon
Speaker of the Assembly Howard E.
Wright stood on the steps in front of
the Golden Eagle Hotel and exclaimed,
"To-morrow I will get my vindication."
'. He got it.
It time to-day in the form of are
: port from the Assembly Investigating
commi'Uee setting forth that Wright's
â  offense against the law and against the
rights of the people of the State was too
great for mere censure. Deposition
: from his position of Speaker or expul
sion from the Assembly were suggested
as the only means whereby the Assem
bly could justly punish Wright for the
grave offense of which he had been
found guilty.

It was a vindication for those who
have urged the cause of justice and de
manded that the Assembly purge itself
â of the disgrace that would follow the
shielding of a member accused of an
.infamous act. So far as the report of
' the committee relates to the charge
against the Speaker of the Asembly no
one can say that it deals out more or
less than even-handed justice. In this
particular all honest men must take
. their hats off to the members of the
â¢ committee, for the reason that they
have shown neither fear nor favor and
have held to the right in spite of the
efforts that have been made by Sen
atorial candidates, whose toes were be
ing pinched, to pull them down.
The committee's report, which is print
ed in full in another column, sets forth
.; in detail all of the counts in the in
dictment against Wright. It also con
tains a severe arraignment of U. S.

Grant Jr., and his political manager,
Milton J. Green, for the methods em-
ployed by them incident to the use of
money to promote Grant's Senatorial
candidacy. D. M. Burns and William
F. Herrin are not forgotten, nor did
Assemblyman Jilson escape without
being mentioned in connection with the
payment to him of $400 for use during
the campaign. It was to Assemblyman
Cosper that the whitewash brush was
applied in a manner that may not be
fully understood yTthout a relation of
the proceedings of the day that pre
ceded the filing of the committee's re
port.
Early in the afternoon the sub-cor- |
mittee appointed for that purpose paid '
a visit to the apartments of Milton J.
Green in the Golden Eagle Hotel for the
purpose of taking his deposition in re
lation to the accusation, that Assembly
man Cosper had, through " Charles G.
Lamberson, solicited a bribe of $6000 '
from Green in return for his promise to |
vote for Grant for Senator. Green's tes- j'â 
timony was to the effect that he had
been visited by Lamberson soon after '
the Legislature convened and that
Lamberson had suggested that if he
would give Cosper $6000 the Assembly
man might be Induced to vote for
Grant. Lamberson added that Cosper
had received a like offer from the Burns
people, but that he would prefer to
cast his vote for the San Diegan, all
conditions being equal. For reply
Green sent his compliments to Cosper
with the statement that he waa not in
the business of buying votes.
Lamberson was put on the stand later
ln the afternoon and in reply to ques
tions told the committee that he had
called on Green, who, by the way, had

THE CALL'S POSITION ON

"FirstâThat the conduct of Howard E. Wright, Speaker of the Assem

that no mere censure on the part of the Assembly can meet the requirements
of justice. -: *rr-:-'^o '. _' : : -vÂ»".*

reimbursed him to the extent of $135,
money spent in the campaign, and had
suggested that Green use money to se
cure the votes of legislators for Grant.
He then said, "Jokingly," that if Green
wanted Cosper's vote he had better pay
him (Cosper) $5000 or $6000.
In making out its report the com
mittee made light of this evidence and
completely exonerated Cosper. With
rare presence of mind Chairman Cosper
signed his name to the report, thus
putting himself on record as a believer
in his own innocence. It is not often
that a man can be found in public life
who has the strength of character to
investigate himself and the courage to
make public the result over his own
signature.
The report of the investigating com
mittee was read in- the Assembly at
5:30 o'clock this ' afternoon, adjourn-
ment . having been postponed to allow
the committee time in- which to finish
the preparation of the written result
of its deliberations during the past ten
days... As. soon .as. the clerk had fin
ished reading, Johnson : of Sacramento
moved ' that the consideration of the
report be postponed until ; to-morrow
morning, and that it be made ? special
order for that time. There was no op
position to this proposition, and the
motion was carried.
; â¢ This morning, when it j was known
that the committee would report this
afternoon, and that tne report would
handle Speaker Wright without gloves,
the leaders in the Burns camp set
about to find some way by which
Wright could be saved. It soon be
came known that the Burns forces
would make an attempt to delay â  the
consideration of the report until such
time as they could fix up a programme
to their liking. To this end it was ar
ranged that Dibble of San Francisco
should occupy the speaker's chair when
the report was, presented, and that he
would cut off debate. Johnson of Sac-
ramento was selected to lead the fili
bustering on the floor in case the ma
jority of the members displayed an in
clination to discuss the report.
/ In pursuance of this plan/ Speaker
â¢Wright called Dibble to the chair im
mediately after the Assembly . recon
vened after the noon recess, and there
he stayed until the report was read at
5:30 o'clock. The lateness of the hour
prevented all members from \ desirine
to discuss the â¢ report to-day, i and so
it was that Johnson encountered no
opposition to his motion to postpone
action. ' , '
To-night Dibble â  and Johnson held a
long conference with Burns.. and plans
were prepared for the fight that is to
be made for. Wright to-morrow. It is
probable that they will seek' to have
the consideration of the report post
poned until Monday, hoping that over
Sunday some scheme may be concocted
or some combination effected that will
prove of advantage to themselves. As
this is the sort of politics that "is most
congenial to Burns, It is quite probable
that he' will outgeneral the' opposition
and finally succeed in carrying out the
promise made by him to the disgraced
Speaker. He has for his lieutenants
on the floor of the Assembly such men
as Johnson and Dibble, i both '. of whom
have .long: since served their appren
ticeship ,in the art of obstructlnc
latlon when such a course is necessary j
to carry out a given purpose. < r ., â¢â,;..
The Grant forces are as yet undecided
as to the course they shall pursue rela
tive to the report of the committee.
They held an informal 'caucus" to-night
and decided to postpone further discus
sion of their attitude in the matter un
til 9 o'clock to-morrow morning, when
they will hold another meeting and
finally determine whether to stand by
the report or consent -to a postpone
ment until Monday. ',f i
The followers of Senator Bulla also
caucused to-night. They. . decided to
stand by the report and vote for its ac
ceptance. The same course will proba
bly be pursued by the Barnes - forces,
the minority members and .such other
scattering members as are not in sym
pathy with Burns and his followers.
There is also some talk to-night -to the
effect that Wright â¢ ; may . resign as
Speaker and thus put an end to all con
troversy. Such a course would probably
have the effect .of anticipating any
action looking to his expulsion from the
Assembly. Very little credence is given
these rumors, as it -is considered prob
able that Wright- will rely on Burns to
save him by the practice of some sharp
political trick. '
; Neither Burns nor the Assembly can
save Wright from the condemnation of
the committee, because that has al
ready been rendered and no amount of
political juggling or sharp practice can
set â¢it aside. â¢ The committee not only
condemned . him, but \it also fixed his
sentence, which is deposition or expul
sion.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â Legislature is will
ing that the State of California shall
spend $300 to secure a picture of ex-Gov
ernor J. H. Budd to place in the Capitol,
gallery of famous men. The Senate final
ly passed the bill this morning. Original
ly the Assemblymen voted to spend $500
for this picture, but the Senate reduced
it to $300. thinking that amount suffi
cient. The House will probably concur in
the amendment and the bill will very
shortly be in Governor Gage's hands.

BY THE CALL HAS

Condemns Wright.
Enormity of the Speaker's Offense Set Forth
in Terms That Permit of No Misunder
standing and Leave No Loophole.
The special committee appointed to investigate into. scandals
connected with the election of the United States Senator finds that
Howard E. Wright, Speaker of the Assembly, received from U. S.
Grant Jr., through his political manager, Milton J. Green, $900
. as a gift and! $750 as a loan; that Wright prior to his election de
ceived John D. Spreckeis and W. S. Leake to secure their sup
port for the speakership ; that he also secured the support of Robert
N. Bulla and Daniel M. Burns through, deception.
The committee finds further that U. S. Grant, through his
manager, Green, spent large sums of money to secure the election
of a Republican Legislature, the exact amount to the committee
unknown.
The committee recommends: First â That the conduct of How
ard E. Wright, Speaker of the Assembly, as above set forth, be
held to be reprehensible in an extreme degree and that no. mere
censure on the part of the Assembly can meet the requirements of \

' -Mr. Speakerâ Your~speclal- committee on investigation beg leave to report .
that on the 16th day of January, 1899, the Assembly duly passed the follow

> Whereas, It has been charged that some persons have used and *
are using illegal methods to influence the action of members of the As

Whereas, It has been indirectly charged that members of the As- i
sembly have been improperly influenced in their votes for United States ]_â .
Senator; and "yyyy Â
Whereas, Such charges have been given wide publicity and
should be investigated to the end that if found to be true the guilty
should be punished, and if found tobe untrue the originators thereof
should be punished; now therefore, be it v
Resolved, That a select committee of seven members of the Assem
bly be appointed by the Speaker pro tern. to immediately and fully,, thor
oughly and carefully investigate each and ' all of i said charges, whether
direct or indirect, and also to investigate in like manner the methods j
used to influence members of the Assembly in â¢ their* votes for United
States Senator, and that said committee have full power to send for per
sons, books, telegrams and papers and to employ a clerk and stenog
rapher, and that it have leave to sit during the sessions of the Assem
ply, and that said committee report, fully, as speedily as possible, with
such recommendations as it may deem proper. ;S'>A
That Immediately upon the adoption of the resolution we entered upon our
duties in that behalf, and have diligently prosecuted the inquiry to this
time, holding our sittings daily and nightly. r*'yy V
A great number of witnesses. have been examined, and a wide range of \
Inquiry -has been instituted.* entering even into, the domain of rumor and
conjecture that no hidden truth might escape us. â  â¢ ryy- .'--'.'
We herewith report our findings: "
. ...... - . .-
First That the Hon. Howard E. Wright, Speaker of the
Assembly of this the thirty-third session of the Legislature of
the State of California, received irom Ulysses S. Grant Jr.,
through his duly accredited . political manager, Milton J.
Green, the sum of $900 as a contribution to assist him to se
cure his election to this Assembly, which sum of money, as testi
fied by said Wright, was expended by the said Wright in ad
vancing his nomination and election, prior to the primaries next
preceding the general election on November 8,- 1898.
Second â That the said Wright also received from the same
sources the further sum of $750 after his nomination and pre-
ceding his election, which sum was a loan to be repaid.
â  â .'â¢"''.-''.,'' ,' â  - - . ... -.
Third That the said Wright, prior to his election as
Speaker of this Assembly, led John D. Spreckeis and W. S.
Leake, owner and manager, respectively, of the; San Francisco
Call, to believe that he was wholly unpledged and under no ob
ligations relative to the election of United States Senator, and
thereby secured to himself the supporting influence of the San
Francisco Call in the furtherance of his candidacy for the Speak
ership.
Fourthâ That the said Howard E. Wright secured to him
self the influence of Robert N. Bulla and his friends in aid of his
election to the Speakership by an expressed promise that, if
elected, he would vote for the said Robert N. Bulla for United
States Senator. /
Fifthâ That the said Howard E. Wright, by the acceptance
of said contribution of $900 in aid of his election, and in the
acceptance of said loan of .said sum of $750 from Ulysses S.
Grant Jr., led the said Grant to believe that if the said Howard
E. Wright were "elected to the Assembly he would be friendly to

INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
the candidacy of the said Ulysses S. Grant for : United -State's
Senator.
Sixthâ That the said Howard E. Wright sought and ob
tained the influence of Daniel M. Burns in aid of his candidacy
for the 'Speakership in such- a manner as to lead the said Daniel
M. Burns to expect the vote of the said Howard E.Wright,
after the said Daniel M.Burns had become a candidate for
United States Senator, by reason of the obligations he (Wright)
was under for such aid and influence. Âv
Seventhâ That in receiving said sums
of money from the .said Ulysses S.
Grant Jr., and in receiving such aid and
assistance from the said Daniel Burns,
there was no consideration given there
for by the said Howard E. Wright by
way of an expressed promise to vote
for either of said candidates for United
States Senator.
Eighthâ That th.' said Howard E.
Wright applied to W. F. Herrin of the
i aw department of the Southern Pacific
Company for transportation mileage
tickets instead of making application
to the offices of the said company, who
usually sell such tickets, and that the
said Howard E. Wright, on the receipt
of the same, paid therefor the regula
l'" price. . '' .. ._
Ninthâ That as to the charge that the
said Howard E. Wright applied to the
said W. F. Herrin for $1200, or any oth
er sum of money, we were unable to
obtain any evidence whatever in sup
port thereof.
Tenthâ That Milton J. Green of San
Francisco was the duly appointed and
accredited political manager of Ulysses
S. Grant Jr. of San Diego, a candidate
before the Legislature for United States
Senator. *.'â *' ~ . _
Eleventhâ That the said Milton J.
Green had the full power to manage
such candidacy in such manner and
method as he night choose, and to ex
pend such moneys as he saw fit. in any
sum and any manner at any place that
he might deem proper, saving 'and ex
cepting such expenditures should be
legitimate and only for legitimate pur
poses, as testified by the said Milton J.
Green and Ulysses S. Grant Jr.
' Twelfthâ That the said Milton J.
Green expended large. sums of money,
exceeding in amount $20,000, but the
exact sum of which this committee has
been unable to learn for the reason that
the said Milton J. Green refused to.
answer certain questions which were
calculated to develop that fact. and for
which refusal he now stands commit
ted to appear before the bar of the As
sembly to show cause why he should
not be held for contempt.
Thirteenthâ That on behalf of the
said Ulysses S. Grant Jr. the said Mil
ton J. Green sent various sums of
money, ranging in amounts from $100
to $500, into many of the legislative
districts for the purpose of assisting in
the election of a Republican Legisla
ture. In at least ten of. such districts
the Republican candidates therein had
no knowledge of the money so expend
ed in their behalf.
Fourteenth the said Milton
J. Green, on behalf of the said
Ulysses S. Grant Jr., gave to Daniel
T. Cole the sum of $500, to be ex
pended by the said Cole in aid of the
candidacy of the said Ulysses S.
Grant Jr. for United States Senator;
that of the said sum of $500 the said
Daniel T. Cole expended $100 in
traveling and hotel expenses for him
self and the remaining $400 the said
Cole gave to Assemblyman Jilson of
the First Assembly District, which
amount, as testified by the said Jilson,
was expended in aid of the election of
the Republican candidates for Gov
ernor, Railroad Commissioner, Jus
tice of the Supreme Court, member of
With the Senators During ; the Discussion on the Bond Question . for the Improvement San Francisco's Seawall.
Congress and the State Senator in the
Second District; but that no part
thereof was by the said Jilson ex
pended in aid of his own candidacy.
Fifteenthâ That the said Milton J.
Green, for the purpose of aiding the
candidacy of Ulysses S. Grant Jr. for
United States Senator, offered to As
semblyman Alden Anderson, represent
ing the Nineteenth Assembly District,
the sum of $250 or thereabouts, to aid
the said Anderson's election; which
tender was by the said Anderson re
jected.- -
Sixteenthâ That in no case where the
said Milton J. Green expended money
in aid of the candidacy of the said
Ulysses S. Grant Jr. for United States
Senator, so far as the evidence adduced
shows, was a direct promise exacted
from any legislative candidate into
whose district money was sent that he.
the said candidate, should vote for the
said Ulysses S. Grant Jr. for United
States Senator.
Seventeenthâ That the moneys so ex
pended, as aforesaid, by the said Milton
J. Green, in aid of the candidacy of
Ulysses S. Grant Jr. were not expended
through the medium of the State cen
tral or the various county central com
mittees to aid in the election of the
general ticket, but were expended by
the said Milton J. Green in aid of the
legislative ticket, except the money ex
pended by Assemblyman Jilson, as
above set forth. However, the said
Ulysses. S. Grant Jr. did make a per
sonal contribution of $450 to the county
central committee of San Diego County
in aid of the general ticket.
Eighteenthâ That the evidence does
not reveal that Daniel M. Burns, Robert
X. Bulla, W. H. L. Barnes or any other
candidate for United States Senator,
except as herein stated, has expended
any money, promised any patronage or
threatened to withhold any patronage
under their control in aid of their can
didacy, yy-.yy-
Nineteenthâ That A. H. Merrill, As
. semblyman, representing the Thirty
; sixth District, solicited Daniel M. Burns
I to use his influence to secure two rail
: road tickets from W. F. Herrin, chief
' counsel of the Southern Pacific Com
, pany, for the use of a friend who had
- assisted said Merrill in his candidacy
! for the Assembly. That said Daniel M.
Burns did purchase said tickets for the
i friend of said Assemblyman Merrill and
a few days thereafter paid the said
' Herrin $132 50 for the same. It is testi
fied to by the said Merrill and the said
j Burns that the said tickets were pur
chased and paid for on\y as an act of
| charity and fraternal obligation.
In the case of Assemblyman E. T.
â  Cosper the testimony shows â  that
Charles G. Lamberson, an attorney of
Visalia, in talking with Milton J. Green,
suggested as others were making a
money fight perhaps he (Green) had
better offer Cosper $5000 or $6000. The
testimony further shows that this in
timation was made wholly without the
knowledge or consent' of said Cosper
and was flatly refused and rebuked by
Green. The testimony further shows
that said Cosper is, wholly exonerated
from the intimation of improper influ
ences. ; â  â¢â -; '-. -â¢' :y .'â¢
That, in view of the above findings
of fact, your, committee recommends:

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 27.-Here is where
Assemblyman Cosper gets his bucket of whitewash :
EXTRACT FROM REPORT OF COMMITTEE.
"In the case of Assemblyman E. T. Cosper the testimony shows that
Charles G. Lamberson, an attorney of Visalia, in talking with Milton J.
Green, suggested as others were making a money fight perhaps he (Green)
had better offer Cosper $5000 or $6000. The testimony further shows
that this intimation was made wholly without the knowledge or con
sent of said Cospar and was flatly refused and rebuked by Green.
The testimony further shows that said Cosper is wholly exonerated from
the intimation of improper influences."
EXTRACT FROM TESTIMONY OF LAMBERSON.
"I said to him : 'Well, Milt, ain't you making a money fight on this
proposition?' and he said 'No.' ' Well,' I said, *I didn't know, but if you
were perhaps you might offer Cosper five or six thousand dollars, and he
would see it your way,' "
EXTRACT FROM GREEN'S TESTIMONY.
"Mr, Lamberson went on to say that he had heard it reported that
Mr. Cosper had been offered $6000 to vote for Burns, and that perhaps he
was waiting for a similar offer from us,"
Speaker of the Assembly,
as above set forth, be held
to be reprehensible In an
extreme degree, and that
no mere censure on the
part of the Assembly can
meet the requirements of
justice. Without recom
mending what shall be
done in the premises,
whether deposition from
the speakership or other
adequate punishment, we
leave the course to be pur
sued to the judgment of
the Assembly.
Secondâ That the expen
diture of large sums of
money in aid of the candi
; dacy of a United States
Senator .in the manner
above set forth is wrong
and reprehensible, in that
it is calculated to corrupt
i morals, to debauch the
political system, to deter
poor men of ability from
entering upon a Senatorial
campaign, and to give to
the rich an unwarranted
and unjustifiable advan
tage over men of equal
ability and qualifications,
but of limited means ; that
the receiving of money by
legislative candidates
from probable Senatorial
candidates, either directly
or indirectly, in aid of their
own candidacy, is repre
hensible for the same rea

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â The Senate will un
doubtedly pass the act of Senator Braun
hart providing for the issuance and sale
of State bonds in the sum of $1,000,000 to
create a fund for the extension and im
provement of the seawall and thorough
fare of the harbor of San Francisco and
providing for the submission of the act
to the vote of the people.
The bill came up in the Senate this
morning, and Senator Cutter of. Yuba and
Senator Simpson of . Los Angeles en
deavored by every power and influence
they possessed to defeat it, but they were
almost alone. y'y
The bill was amended by reducing the
amount of interest the bonds shall bear
from Vto 3_ per cent, and the State was
made preferred purchaser or the bonds
at par. The bill was then advanced to
third reading-.
The important provisions of Senator
Braunhart's bill are as follows:
For the purpose of providing a fund for the
payment of the indebtedness to be Incurred
for the construction and extension of the sea
wall and thoroughfare of the harbor of San
Francisco southward from its present southerly

Senator Braunhart said the amendment
was not unsatisfactory to him unless it
would have the effect of making the bill
special legislation and therefore uncon
stitutional. He wanted to know ,if the
State could purchase its own bonds. He
thought that the regents of the State
University or the State Board of Exam
iners might be authorized to make, pur-,
chases, but the word "State" he deemed a
little too large. ...::â¢;
Senator Rowell offered an amendment
making the regents of the State Univer
sity equally preferred purchasrs with the
State of these bonds. â â ;â 'â '.-â "â  " "â "â 
Dr. Rowell in support of his amendment,
stated that no better investment of uni
versity funds could be made than in these
bonds. '--'â¢ '-â _/" _.
Senator Bulla, in opposing Dr. Rowell s
amendment, stated that he had at all
times worked and voted for the good of
the State University. But ordinary- pub
lic schools, he said, were maintained â  by
direct taxation. High schools were not,,
for the reason that It was agreed that
the people at large should not be. taxed
for higher education. Yet the State had:
jumped all over the High School propo
sition and had taxed the people directly
for the maintenance of the State Lniver
sltv, which was even higher than, the
High Schools. 'i''J-\ , -Â.,+
Senator Simpson wanted to know If it
was the proper thing to bring a. State
in direct competition with its people as
a purchaser.
Senator Bulla held that there was no
competition, and Rowell's proposed
amendment was lost. - . ._'_'-
Senator Smith was of the opinion that
the university regents should be allowed
to purchase some of the bonds.
Senator Bulla said that as the univer
sity regents never accounted to the State
for any of their expenditures it was not.
really a department of the State govern
ment. r ' y \-\
Senator Simpson opposed the proposi
tion of making any preferred purchasers,
as it brought the State into competition
with Its people. To sell interest. bearing
bonds to the State at par when the same
bonds would in the open market hring a
premium was an Injustice to people pur--,
chasing bonds above par, which the State
could purchase at par. Senator Simpson,
opposed the amendment and said he was ,
also opposed to the whole bill. ' s -
Senator Bulla's amendment making the
rate of Interest on the bonds 3 _ per cent
and making the State a preferred creditor;
at par was adopted. '.-'-.?â â ' '*. ii
An amendment by Senator Smith,, pro
viding that voting by the people on this.
bond issue be under the Australian ballot
system, was adopted. . ' . ' '
Senator Smith moved to entirely strike
out section 12 of the act providing .for the
publication of the act in two^San-Fran^.
cteco. newspapers, two Los Angeles pa- :
pers, one In San Jose, Stockton and Sac
ramento. The amendment was adopted. .;-â
Senator Cutter endeavored, to have the,.
rate of interest to be paid on the bonds
reduced from 3 _ to 3 per cent. .. ; : ,- :
Senator Braunhart thought â¢ that diffi- .
culty would be experienced in- selling the,
bonds at par when they bore Interest at.
only 3 per cent.
Senator Simpson, anxious .to defeat the
bill and its purpose, favored' the proposi
tion to reduce the rate of interest,- s* > tâ â 
Senator Cutter claimed that Massachu- 5
setts, which State had a heavy debt','sold
its bonds at a premium. He thought Call*
fornia was a wealthy State, had no debt,
and the impression should not go out that
in order to dispose of its bonds they must.,
necessarily bear a high rate of interest.
Senator Morehouse called attention to
the fact that an amendment i had been â¢
j adopted making the bonds a popular loan,
! but if the rate of Interest was further re-'
I duced. that purpose would be defeated. -
Senator Burnett and Senator . Dwyer
j both held that Senator Cutter's amend-*
--j ment was calculated to defeat the pur-:
pose of the bill.
Senator Cutter opposed the proposition'
i of fixing the State rate of interest at 3*4
I per cent. He demanded a rollcall and,,
j thereupon found that his amendment was
j defeated by a vote of 9 to 17.
Senator Smith then moved that the. bill
i be refused engrossment. He said he made
! the motion, not to kill the act, but . to
; give the Senate time to think about, it.
|He said that not a newspaper â¢' in the'
: State that he had ever seen had expressed -
I itself as favoring the issuance of State .,
| bonds for improvement purposes. If he
j was not given time to study the bill and
' if time was not given to hear from the
j public press, he proposed to vote, on for- '
; mal passage, against the bill. - . â  . -.- -
Senator Boyce concurred In what Sena
i tor Smith had said. '
j Senator Braunhart in response to Smith
said that every merchants' association in.
I Sari Francisco had declared :in favor of â¢
I his bill. Public opinion In the rr- State's
j metropolis was an absolute unit ip favor
ofo the bill. ...
Senator Smith endeavored to withdraw
I his motion that the bill be denied engross
ment, but Senator Cutter objected. -
Senator Simpson and Senator Braun- ..
] hart had a personal tilt as to who was en-
I titled to the floor. Senator Simpson in- ,
I slsted on speaking, but he. was speaking ,
] against time. He moved that the further *
i consideration of the bill go over until

This motion was lost, and by a vote of

LOOKING INTO THE
COSPER TRANSACTION
Testimony of Green and Lamberson
Regarding the Affair.
One Viewed It as a Joke and the Other as a Very
Serious Matter, and There Is Quite a Story
Between the Lines.
.. SACRAMENTO, Jan. Late this j
:.;.. afternoon the special committee ap
v â¢ "pointed to look into Legislature scan- j
â  â¢ dais growing out of the Senatorial fight j
.'"0 .filed its report. Before it did so, how- i
:^ver, it held several open and executive ;
:â ; '.feesslons.
Immediately after the vote for United j
.; States Senator was taken the commit- j
r tee met to hear evidence. A certificate j
' . from the attending physician was filed i
V Setting forth that Assemblyman Dale ;
'..was too ill to appear before the com- |
;- rnlttee. The circumstances will be re- j
:.. ported to the Assembly to-morrow
â  : morning. v
'.. Thomas Nosier was given an oppor- â 
. tunity to testify. He stated that he J
had never told any story connecting j
: Assemblyman Cosper with a bribe of
"'. 16000, said to have been offered by Dan
M. Burns, nor had he been with Lam- |
: i . berson of Visalla to Milton J. Green j
to solicit $6000 in Assemblyman Cos- j
\ per's behalf. Last summer witness had j
borrowed $200 from Milton J. Green,
: but had not worked for Grant during
the campaign on account of the loan; j
in fact he was not aware that it was I
â  Grant's money.
The committee, after Nosier had tes
f, tided, took a recess until 1:30 o'clock
: to give a sub-committee consisting of
Burnett. Mellck and La Baree an op
/ portunity to take further testimony of
â  Milton J. Green, he being too ill to leave
' : his room.
.'.'â¢â¢'â¢ On reconvening the sub-committee
.: presented the following report:
Report of Suh-Commitee.
We your committee, composed of J.
' K. Burnett, W. S. Meliok, Dr. La Baree,
appointed to take the deposition of Mil
"â ' ton J. Green, beg leave to make the
- following report:
â¢ We went to the Golden Eagle Hotel
-.. and found Mr. Green in bed, and were
permitted to enter the room after some
little delay by Dr. A. T. Hatch. We
found Mr. Green in bed, sick. Then
we took the following deposition, with
â¢. : . Dr. Hatch and Attorneys Messrs. Bacon
/and Metson in the room:
By Mr. Burnettâ We were sent down
here to take your deposition in regard i
'' : \ 'â  to how this statement of Mr. L___be_
'-. son's came to you. Then Mr. Cosper
â¢*.." came to you with the proposition that
.'". Mr. Burns had offered him $6000 for his
'â  "vote, and that while he preferred to vote
'â â¢ for Grant that he thought he ought to
-.'. have as much as that from the Grant
' people? We want your statement in re
â ":'. gard to the facts in connection there
with: â¢
-â¢-.':. The witness (Mr. Green) I
: ' can say, gentlemen, is this: I have j
known Mr. Lamberson for several j
':.' -years and knew he was chairman of |
the County Central Committee down j
there, and he was in Sacramento, and
. : I asked him to see Mr. Cosper and !
..' urge him to vote for Mr. Grant; that j
Mr. Grant was the only candidate for
â¢.â â â¢ Senator from the Seventh Congres
sional District, and that Mr. Cosper
â¢was the only Assemblyman that was
; not favorable to Mr. Grant from that
â¢district, the Seventh Congressional
District, and he saw Mr. Cosper, so
he said, and I afterward saw him, I
;â¢ , think, in this room (where witness^
was lying in bed). He told me that
' he had used every argument that he
:*â ..!. could with Mr. Cosper to vote for Mr.
' Grant, and Mr. Cosper said that he
.â could not, and he would not vote for
.'.'. Colonel Burns, but that he would hot
:. promise to vote for Mr. Grant. Then
;/ Mr. Lamberson went on to say that i
. he had heard it reported that Mr.
: ..Cosper had been offered $6000 to vote
for Burns, and that perhaps he was
waiting for a similar offer from us.
Â«,;â¢ â ' Q. Were those his exact words as you
.;' remember?
:;. A. I can't give the exact words, and
wouldn't pretend to. I told him, of
- .course. I did not believe anything of the i
'.'â¢'.'â  sort; I didn't believe Colonel Burns had I
â¢ offered him $6000; that it was ridiculous,
â¢'â â¢ and that It must be a joke, and so far
â as we were concerned we were not buy
..' ing any votes for Senator. '
By Dr. La Bareeâ Did Mr. Lamberson i
'". Bay Cosper had said that Burns had of
.-. fered him $6000?
-.'â¢A. .No; I don't remember. He didn't
...tell me who told him this story that an
'.'â â â '. offer had been made.
'â¢ â  Q. You Inferred from what ho said that â¢
.' ..Gosper had told him so?
. A. Well. I did not Infer much.about It, |
..because the thing appeared so ridiculous
..- to me. and I did not believe it. and I so
..told him; told him I did not believe the |
-...story. It was absurd on the face of It
-.to think that any one should be offered
; -r:M000 for his vote. He did not say Mr
â¢Cosper authorized him to crime and tell
'.. mc that, or that he was authorized to
â¢ .pp.eak for Mr. Cosper.
.- Q. Was It your inference that he had
â '.-authorized him to speak to you?
'.â¢â¢'â¢â¢â¢A. Well, from other circumstances that i
â¢ ..had been brought to my attention, I didn't I
..-.believe that he had. I told him to pre
: .- sent my compliments to Mr. Cosper and
â¢ feay that we were not buying any votes '
â â¢..and I did not believe the story
..".By Mr. Burnettâ Well, then, the state
. ment that Mr. Lamberson made to you
-ÂÂ«eemed to come from Mr. Cosper- at
-..-least you understood It come from Cos.
. . â per?
"i* -A. He did not say so.
.'.-, Q. You answered that you told him to
. -.present your compliments to Mr. Cosper'
.â¢A. I said, if you want to you can pre
sent mv compliments to Mr. Cosper and i
. say I don't believe it. I saw Mr. Cosper
'â¢ .'afterward. I never mentioned this story :
'.to him; that is. until after this In vest!
cgatton commenced, and then he told me
â¢ at the State Capitol that he beard the
story from some other source, and that
-' Mr. Lamberson was In no wav author
ized to represent him. the story was un
'-. true, and that Mr. Lamberson was never
â¢ .'authorized to represent him in any way I
' Q. Did Mr. Cosper prior to that at any
-. time say anything to you that would lead !
â ; you to believe that he was making a bid?
â¢ A. No. sir. All the argument I used
.;â¢ with Mr. Cosper was that Mr. ("rant was
â¢ ' the only Senatorial candidate from -the
" Seventh Congressional District, and that
â  all the other Assemblymen in that dis- |
trict; were favorable to Mr. Grant, and
: ihat'l had reason to believe that every i
â¢ vote in the Seventh Congressional Dls- I
'rlet would be for Mr. Grant. Of course. >
â¢ -there were two Senators that had not'
, foted for him, Mr. Flint and Mr. Rowell. I.1 '.
By Mr. La Bareeâ would suggest that
you ask as few questions as possible.
By Mr. Mellckâ Was Thomas Nosier
present when Lamberson was talking to
you?
A. Nobody was present at all.
Q. Was anybody else present?
A. I said nobody was present except Mr.
Lamberson and myself.
Q. Did you see Mr. Lamberson to-day?
A. No, sir. I have not seen him since
he was in Sacramento two or three weeks
ago.
Q. Did Lamberson tell you from what
source he had hoard that Cosper had
been offered money?
A. No, sir. He did not say.
Q. Did you send Damberson Grant's
money before this during the progress of
Grant's campaign?
A. Well, gentlemen, I am going to stand
on that as I am on similar questions.
Q. That is, you refuse to answer?
A. I decline to answer, us It has nothing
whatever to do with Mr. Cosper at all or
Mr. Grant. I don't do it out of disrespect
to the committee. It has no bearing on
the question.
The committee reconvened at 1:30 p.
m., every member being present except
Mr. Wade, to hear the report of the
sub-committee of three appointed to re
ceive the deposition of Milton J. Green.
(The reporter read from his notes the
statement of Milton J. Green.)
At the conclusion of the reading of
the report the following resolution was
offered by Mr. Lardner:
"I move that the report of the sub
committee be accepted and adopted,
and that the sub-committee be dis
charged."
This motion was adopted, Chairman
Cosper not voting.
When the committee reassembled
after recess it went into executive ses
sion for an hour. An open session was
then held and C. G. Lamberson given
an opportunity to testify.
Following is a verbatim report of the
testimony of Lamberson:
Lamberson 's Testimony.
C. G. Lamberson being sworn, testified
as follows:
The chairmanâ l hereby nominate Dr.
La Baree chairman of this committee
during the examination of Mr. Lamber
son. 1 will not take partâ for the present
at least.
Mr. La Bareeâ Mr. Lamberson, you are
acquainted with Mr. Cosper. the chairman
of this committee, I suppose?
A. I am.
Q. You are acquainted with Milton
Green? ,
A. I am. J â¢ ...
Q. How long have you been acquainted
with Mr. Green?
A. Two or three years.
Q. Did yon go to Mr. Green with a prop
osition In regard to Mr. Lamberson selling
his vote? *
A. Mr. Cosper you mean.
Q. Or Mr. Cosper selling his vote to Mr.
Grant?
A. I did not. .
Q. You never had any conversation with
him at all on the matter?
A. Yes. sir.
Q. Will you state that to the committee,
please?
A. Yes, if I can.
Q. State It, please.
A. I think perhaps I would have to
preface that a little with my relations
with Mr. Cosper before I could state it
so that you could have It in an Intelligent
manner.
Q. Well, just state the whole thing.
A. About what T said to Mr.
Green I was in Sacramento shortly
after the Legislature convened and in
conversation with Mr. Cosper, whom
I had known for a long time, of
course had been practitioner at the
bar of Tulare County with him for
many years, â I told him that I
thought it would be only proper. for
him to vote for Mr. Grant for Sena
tor. Mr. Cosper said he thought very
favorably of Mr. Grant and of his
chances, but there had been some talk
at that time about the Governor
throwing the patronage away from
any member who might vote for Mr.
Grant; that he would consider it a
personal affront. And at that time
when I was in Sacramento there was
a report to the effect that the Govern
or said that any one who voted for
Grant' would get no favors from the
Governor. Mr. Cosper would not per
mit himself to vote for Mr. Grant,
and among others he spoke to me
about Mr. Bulla. I told him that I
had met Mr. Bulla when he was in
the Assembly. I thought he was a
very nice man and would make a
good Senator, all right; still, my
preferences were for Grant. In a
conversation which I had with Mr.
Green some time after that I detailed
to Mr. Green substantially the state
ments that Mr. Cosper had made to
me, and then, in a joking way, I said
to him, "Well, Milt, ain't you mak
ing a money fight on this proposi
tion?", and he said, "No." Well, I
said, "I dian't know, but if you were,
perhaps you might offer Cosper five
or six thousand dollars and he would
see it your way." And he said, "Well,
we are not making any money fight.
I wouldn't give him six cents, nor
any other man." And so the incident
closed. I had no serious thought in
the matter at all, and I am satisfied
that Mr. Green did not, because
everything that was said in connec
tion with the matter was - said in a
joking way, and I never thought
anything more of it. I went home a
few days after that. That was ail of
that incident.
Q. When did this conversation with Mr.
Cosper take place in regard to that mat
ter?
A. Well, I had several conversations
with Mr. Cosper. I had a conversation
with him one evening In the billiard room
of the Golden Eagle. I had conversations
with him on the street and several times
wherever I met him. I cannot remember
all that was said at any one conversation
but what I have told you Is the general
purport and meaning of the whole. I want
to say that Mr. Cosper never, byword
or deed, or in any manner, Intimated to
me, in any way, shape or manner,- that
he was desirous of or expected any pe

cuniary consideration for his vote in any I
manner whatever. And, in fact, such a j
thing never was spoken of or hinted at j
between us.
Mr. Burnettâ Why did you suggest, ,
then, that perhaps if he would put up j
five or six thousand dollars he might be i
able to see it Green's way?
A. Well. I had heard a good many ru
mors, as you always will about- a Legis
lature. The general opinion of the peo
ple seems to bo that when the Legislature
meets Colonel Mazuma also appears, and
that Is a standing joke.
Q. And the hunters for Colonel Mazu
i ma?
i A. Yes. And that is a standing joke
! among the people to talk that wayâ
I slightingly about the members of. the
j Legislature and about their being for
[ sale, just as i^is almost invariably with
all people occupying public positions. ; v -
Mr. Melick Did you not * say to
Mr. Green in that conversation that
Colonel Burns had offered some
moneyP
A. Yes, I told him that â that I
thought that offers were being made.
Q. To Mr. Cosper?
A. No, not to Mr. Cosper.
â¢ Q. But that Colonel Burns was
making offers?
A. Yes; I heard so.
Q. And you told Green that Colonel
Burns wks making offers, and per
haps he had better make an offer?
A. Well, yes, I told him I thought
if he wanted to win, that if the. other
side was going to make money offers,
he had better get in and conduct it
on a money basis also.
Q. And then what did Green say?
A. Oh, he said "I don't believe
that there are any offers being
made." He said, "I don't believe it.
I don't believe there is a cent offered
by anybody. So far as I am con
cerned, I won't give a cent to any
body for their vote."
Q. Did Colonel Burns or any of his
agents or friends make any proposition
to you In regard to Mr. Cosper's vote?
A. Never spoke to me about it at ail
any of them.
Q. Then from whom did you hear that he
was offering money? -
A. Oh, I just heard that in a joshing
way in barrooms and saloons.
Q. Do you remember anybody who said
it?
A. No.no. -â â â â "â¢.':'.â¢â': â â â â â '_ rs.-

Mr. Cosper in regard to what Green had
said, later?
A. No; 1 did not see Mr. Cosper after
that. I went home. Well. I think I had
seen Mr. Cosper the evening before that
and I went home, I think, the evening
after that, and I did not see Mr. Cosper
again.
Q. Now you had been sent money during
the campaign by Mr. Green, had you not?
A. No, sir.
Q. Or by somebody in San Francisco?
A. No, sir.
Q. Somebody in the State?
A. No, sir; not by anybody.
Q. For distributing, for campaign pur
poses? -;Â»â 
A. No, sir.
,Q. Did not you give an ex-Senator down
there in your county $400 to distribute?
A. No, sir.
O. For the legislative ticket?
A. No, sir.
Q. Any other amount?
A. No. sir; not a cent.
Q. Now, Mr. Green in his deposition this
afternoon declined to answer how much
money or what amount of money he had
sent you. Is he mistaken in that he sent
you any at all?
A. Well, sir, I will tell you how much
money 1 got from Mr. Green and when I
got it. I did not get any money from Mr.
Green during the campaign.
Q. When was it? - * â *
A. After the campaign was over. I told
Mr. Green that, in advancing the Interests
of th*Â» three legislative candidatesâ one in
the Sixty-fourth, one in the Sixty-fifth
District and one in the Thirty-second
Senatorial Districtâ l had expended out of
my own money $134. and I asked him if
he wanted to reimburse It to me. and he
said, 'Yes, I do." And he gave me $135
and I did not have any dollar in my
pocket to give him back any, and he said,
"Well, we will take a drink on that, sub
sequently." That is all of my financial
transactions. That is all the money
Q. 1 suppose, in reference to yourself,
you will state what position you occupied
at that time? _.
A. I was chairman of the Republican
County Central Committee in Tulare
County, which position I still occupy. -
Q. Had that money been accounted for
in your campaign fund by your auditing
committee?
A. Well, I do not know asâ no; it had
not. The auditing committee did not
know anything about that money. The
auditing committee did not have anything
to do with the legislative ticket, because,
our auditing committee was an auditing
committee for the county and took charge
of the State ticket and of the county of
fices. The county was divided into legis
lative districts, Mr. Cosper' s*Â» district only
taking off a small portion of our countyâ
Tulare Countyâ that is, the Sixty-fourth
District, comprising a small portion of
Tulare County and all of Kings County.
Consequently our disbursing committee,
or auditing and disbursing committee,
could not have charge of those offices or
of those candidates, and did not attempt
to. y-y
Q. Those Assembly districts' had their
own auditing committees, had they not?
A. No, sir; had no auditing committees
that I know of. The fact of the matter
is, this money that I spent was my own
individual money, spent by my own indi
vidual self, without consulting anybody
about it. And if any trouble ensues about
that, why, they can come on me for it.
Q. How much of this money did you
expend in Mr. Cosper's district?
A. Oh, 1 don't know. 1 could not tell
you that. The county was divided by the
Assembly districts, and the Senatorial
'District Included both counties and Inyo
County, and that money was spent indis
criminately in the three districts.
Q. When you got this money from Grant
or from Green did you say anything to
him about these legislators being friendly
to Grant?
A. No; I don't know whether I did or
not. I can't recall. I probably told him
that I thought Mr. Cosper was friendly or
disposed to be friendly with Grant; prob
ably did. I don't recollect that I did.
Q. Well, was that part of the condition
on which you got the money?
A. Oh, no; not at all. Not at all.
Mr. Burnettâ How did you come to ap
ply to Mr. Green for the money, more
than any- other man?
A. Well, I knew that he was spending
money for Mr. Grant, or thought he was,
and I just asked him if. he wanted to re
imburse me. I did not ask him to do it.
I just asked him If he wanted to do It.
Mr. Melickâ Who else was dispensing
money down there, or disbursing that
money down there In your district tor
Grant? .
A. No one that I know of.
Mr. Burnettâ How did you, know t.._t
Mr. Green was spending money for Mr.
Grant? Â _â ; "-;.â â â :â  .
A. Oh. well, I don't remember. I do not
know how I knew that. I knew' It. I
knew it just the same as I know lots of
other things. . â¢ .
Mr. La Bareeâ Have you- been at Mr.
Grant's headquarters to-day? â¢ â¢â¢- - â¢
A. Yes. I went there as soon as I came
in and got something to eat.

A. No. I do not know him. I never met
the gentleman in my life that I know of.
Mr. Mellckâ You were subpenaed sev
eral days ago, were you not, Mr. Lam
berson? :'â¢'' ;"";'-:
A. Yes, sir. r : 2r 'rry
Q. Why didn't you come?
A. Because at the time I was subpenaed
I was engaged in the trial of an action
In court before a jury nnd the case had
at that time continued for six days, and
It lasted in all ten days. I finished mv
argument to the jury last- night at a quar
ter past 5 o'clock and at 5:. I took the
train for Sacramento. I was an officer
of the court and could not" leave the
court. It was impossible for me to get
away. . * . . " .
Mr. La Bareeâ What time did you arrive
here to-day, Mr. Lamberson?
A. 11:25. . f
Q. Did It take you all that time to get
your lunch?
A. Why. no. I was subpenaed to be
here, I understood, at 2:30, or I supposed
the committee would meet at 2:30. If I
had thought that you gentlemen wanted
me I would have come. directly, here, but
I went to the /hotel and put on a clean
collar and went to - the barber-shop and
got shaved and my boots shined. â¢ went'
and got my lunch and went up to the
Golden Eagle Hotel and went into Mr.
Grant's headquarters; wanted to see Mr.
Green, and could not see him; had a
talk with Mr. Brown there in the head
quarters, and then I came up here to the
Surveyor General's office and then -/ent
back downtown again. ;â¢; V
Mr. Burnettâ anybody meet you at
the train? rry-j- . > . .
A. My brother was there to meet me at

knew when I got off the train was Mr.
Brommelâ L. L. Brommelâ and the next
man that I met was my brother.
Q. Did you meet any one on the street
car?
A. Then when I got on the streetcar I
met Mr. Brown.
Q. Mr. Grant's manager?
A. The gentleman that stays there at
the headquarters. ,
Q. What conversation did you and Mr.
Brown have on the streetcar?
A. Why, he told me to come up, that
he wanted to see me as soon as I got
around to it, asked me If I 'was going ut
to that hotel and I told. him "No," that
I was going to the Western, and I told
him that I would be up there after I got
cleaned tip a little.
Q. Did Mr. Brown come to your room
at the Western then? . ;-. .
A. No, sir.
Q. You went to Grant's headquarters
after that, then?
A. Yes; after I got my lunch.
Q. You saw Mr. Brown at Grant's
headquarters? ;. V
A. Yes. sir. , , j/--'
Q. What conversation took place be
tween you and Mr. Brown there?
A Why. I asked him about Milt, about
how he was. He said he was a sick man,
and I asked him If I could not see him.
He said "No." And that is about all the
conversation. I sat around there and
gassed a little while in general conversa
tion. . â _
Q. Did he tell you what he wanted you
to come up there for?
A. No. sir.
Q. What did he, say?
A Well he wanted to talk to me; he
wanted to know, I suppose, something
about what I would testify to.
Q. What you were going to testify to?
A. I suppose so. I supposed he wanted
to know that. , : .
Q. Did he give you any pointers as to
what had been testified to? ;
A. No. Only I had seen the papersâ
had read all the papers myself, v.-' ;
O. Well, did he tell you?
A. No. He dkl not tell me anything.
Q. Did he tell you anything about what
Mr. Green's testimony would be?
A. No, he did not tell me that.
Q. Did you meet any one else down
there on the streetcar?
A. No; no one that I knew. Oh. yes. I
did. On the streetcar I met an agent for
a typewriting machine that I knew, and
shook hands with him.
Q. Who was that? _ ,
A. Ido not know his name. He Is an
agent for the Remington typewriting ma
chine. ' .
Mr. La Bareeâ Was anybody present
during your conversation with Mr.
Brown? " A .. _
A. Well, yes; there were two or three
or four men there, but I did not know
them. I do not know who they are.
Mr. Burnettâ Did you meet Captain
Barbour? :y y . .
A. Not that I know of. I was not in
troduced to any of them. Brown was
the only man that I knew and went In
there and talked with him. He seemed
to take' it for granted that I knew the
others, or else he did not care to Intro
duce me. _
Mr. Melickâ You say that James Brown
was not with you in the Western Hotel?
A. Yes, I do. '
Q. He was not with you in the hotel?
A. He staved on the street car when I
got off at "the Western.
Q. And you went up to room 243, did
you not? ''â 'â ". 2'.
A. Ido not know. I did not know the
number of the room and do not know it
now. They assigned me a room and I
went there and never noticed the num
ber.
Q. Who came to your room?
A. My brother went with me to the
room. No one came there after we went
there. . - . *â *,"'â 
Mr. Burnettâ Mr. Brown told you to
come "to their headquarters there before
you came up her*. '
A. No. lie said: "Come as soon as you\
can; I want to talk -with you.". Of course,
I had met Mr. Brown before and was ac
quainted with him.
Mr. Melickâ Who told you that we met
at 2 o'clock?
A. Well, I saw in the papers that you
met at 2:30, so I supposed, of course, you
met at 2:30. I was here about 2 o'clock
and the doorâ or I went downstairs first
to the sergeant at arm's room about 2
o'clock and asked him where you were
holding your meetings, and he said that
you were in executive session. I came
iip here to the Capitol just about 1 o'clock
and went to the sergeant at arm's room.
I was acquainted with those people in
there, and went in there and stayed for
half an hour.
Mr. Mellckâ From the time that you
were subpenaed, or within the last two
â¢weeks since you went home, you had
some communications from Mr. Cosper,
had you not?
A. By telegraph and telephone. None
by letter. yy, 'â â ":â¢-.
Q. And what was the nature of those?
A. Well, I got the telegrams, I thinkâ l
guess J only got two. I think that was
the first one 1 received (producing it).
Q. Read it.
A. "Sacramento, Cal.. Jan. 21.â G.
Lamberson, Visalla: Will you come here
at once without subpena? Mileage pro
vided. Answer immediately. COSPER."
I think I answered that something to
the effect that I was engaged in the trial
of a case and I could not come; and the
next one was yesterday: "Sacramento,
Cal., Jan. 26â G. Lamberson, Visalla,
Cal.: Come at once. Let nothing delay.
Contempt threatened. Investigating Com
mittee, per Cosper. chairman."
Q. Did you receive any communication
from him that would give you any rea
son to delay your coming? . .''.
A. No, sir. I- tell you, I was engaged
In the trial of a damage case. A woman
was suingâ l was attorney for plaintiff
in a case where a woman was suing for
damages for the death of her husband,
caused .by the explosion, of a gasoline
tank. We had a jury Impaneled a week
ago Monday; on the 16th I was conduct
ing the case on -the part of the plaintiff:
and we 'conducted that case right along
until - Inst night without intermission
every day, and, I concluded, as I told
you, my address to the jury at a quarter
past 5 and left there at 5:50 last night.
And after I got here to Sacramento 1 re
ceived a telegram that the jury had
brought in a verdict.
Q. What Is your brother doing here?
A. I do not know; he is not engaged in
any occupation at present.
Q. Is he working in the interest of
Grant's canvass?
A. No, sir; he Is not a politician.
Q. What did he tell you about this in
vestigation to-day?
A. He did not tell me anything about
it. He wanted to know if I had read the
papers. I told 'him I had. I asked him
if he knew anything except what was In
the papers. He said, "No, that Is all the
Information I haveâ from reading the
papers."
Mr. Burnettâ What about that telephone
dispatch that you received from Cosper?
What was the nature of that?
A. Oh, he seemed to be very much ex
ercised because I could not drop my
business there and come down here. And
I. told him that it was utterly Impossible;
that I could not do it, and I was not go
ing to get up and leave that case rigHt
in the middle of it; I could not do It. The
court would not let me, in the first place.
I was between two fires. If I left there
I -would be fined for comtempt, and I
thought this investigation could wait until
I got through. In fact, I knew It would
wait for me.
' Q. Did you receive any other telephonic
dispatches from any one in connection
with this case?
. A. -Yes,- sir. "yyy
Q. What were they and who from?
. A. Milt Green. One day he called me up
and heâ well. J could not understand ex
actly. Milt Green has got a very bad
voice for telephonic communication, but
I understood enough to understand that
he was swearing mad about the story that
had got outâ report that bad got out
âabout Cosper and bis conversation with
me. And then there were some other
he said something else about Cosperâ that
he believed that Cosper was going into
the Burns camp, or something of that
kind, and I told him I didn't believe a
word of It; and that was about the ex
tent of that. And he wanted to know If
couldn't come down.
Q. What did he want you to come down
here for? . '
A. Well, he said to straighten that
thing out.
Q. To keep Cosper In line for Grant? â¢
A. No, no; to testify before this com
mittee. He wanted me toâ
Q. What did he want you to straighten
out? /â¢â 
A: This story that had got about that
six thousand dollars, â¢ ....,.-.
Q. Well, according to Mr. Green's tes
timony and according to . your own the
story was true?
A. Well, it was not true as published in
the papers. That was what he had ref
erence to.
Q. Did any one telephone or any one
else telephone to you and ask you If this
was true as reported? -
A. No; hold on. Yes; Mr.*Mellck did. Is
that your name?
Q. This is Mr. Mellck (indicating.)
A. Well, Mr. ( Mellck called me up on the
telephone and asked me if there was any
trutn in it and 1 told him "No." 1 expect
I put it in very emphatic language; toid
him there wasn't a word of truth
in it; something of that kind.
Q. What about your testimony here
now? You testify there is truth In it?
A. I do not think so, I do not think so.
I do not think I have testified that way. â
Q. Did you not say that you told Milt
Green that you thought he had better go
In and make a money fight If he was go
ing to win? . , , ,'f_
A.. Well, that hadn't anything to do with
Cosper. I did not say anything of that
kind about Cosper. :_ â 
Q. Did not you in your testimony
here say that you told him that per
haps Cosper is waiting for a five or
six thousand aollar bid?
_* â¢
A. Yes, sir.
Q. You did?
A. Yes, I told that to Green.
Q. What did you tell him that
for?
A. Well, I don't know why I told
him that, only thisâ that I thought
that if that was the kind of light that
was going to be made, Grant better
make ,it.
Q. He had better make an offer to
CosperP
A. No, not to him particularly,
but to anybody.
Q. Well, you were talking about
Cosper at the time?
A. Well, no; at that time I was not
talking particularly about Cosper.
Q. As I understood your testi
mony, now, you said that you told
him "perhaps he is waiting for a five
or six thousand dollar offer"
A. Yes.
*" Q. Then you were talking about
CosperP
A. Well, yes; that might have
reference to him in that way.
Q. Mr. Cosper was your friend, as I un
derstood it?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Of course you understand that con
necting a man's name with a five or six
thousand dollar offer would not place your
friend in a very good' light, do you not?
A. Well, there is no intimation at all
on my part and I had no right to inti
mate anything of the kind, that Mr. Cos
per would accept any sum of money what
ever for bis vote, or that he could be in
fluenced by any financial consideration
whatever.
Q. But you suggested that perhaps he
had better do it?
A. Well, I suggested it. I suppose it
was more in a joking way than anything
else. I suggested it upon the same plan
that we talk about those thingsâ the same
lines as the newspapers will talk about
there being money In the fight, and all
that sort of thing. For myselfâ l wanted
to find out for myself, too, as a matter of
curiosity, whether there actually was go
ing to beâ if it was going to be fought out
on that line.
Q. You found it was not going to be
fought out on that line?
A. Well, I do not know whether I did' or
not.
Q. You left the next morning?
A. I left that evening.
Q. Mr. Green told you that he was not
buying votes?
A. Yes. sir.
Q. And the next morning you left?
A. Yes left that evening. I would
have left anyway, jas my time was up.
I bad to go home.
Q. What -was your object in finding out
whether they were making a money fight
or not, or making an offer for votes?
A. As a matter of curiosity to know. I
always try to keep up with political af
fairs, and it does a man good sometimes
to know things.
Q. Now, you are a man of enough brains
to know that connecting a man's name, as
you did Mr. Cosper there, with a propo
sition of offering or giving him five or
six thousand dollars for his vote might
bring him into disrepute; you realized
that at that time, did you not?
A. No, sir; I did not.
Q. You realize now?
A. I do not realize It. I did not realize
it then and I do not realize" now that any
legitimate inference of that kind could be
drawn from it and I not believe that
it would have any place whatever in any
body mind if it was not tor a suspicious
legislative investigation going on, where
they are following up all sorts of idle ru
mors that there is absolutely nothing in
and which they know there is nothing in.
when they start in to follow them up.
Q. You realize that it has caused Mr.
Cosper's name to be connected with ugly
rumors throughout the State?
A. Yes, sir, for all of which I am very
sorry. - -v- .: ,
Q. Now, tell us why you made that
proposition to Mr. Green.
A. I did not make any proposition to
Mr. Green, sir. t\
Q. Well, as you testified here in your
testimony, why did you make that propo
sition? . â â  . Â
A. I have explained why I made it.
Q. You have not explained.
A. I have explained.
Q. Well, what was it?
A. The reporter's notes will snow what
that explanation Is.
Q. You have not told us why you asked
that n question.
A. 1 have told you.
Q. Well, tell us again.
A. I don't choose to.
Q.Weil, were you fishing? Were. you
attempting to pull Mr. Green's leg in your
own interest, if not Mr. Cosper s? -2:
A. Not at all. sir. Not at all. '
Q. You were very much Interested to
find out whether a money fight was going
on?
V A. lam one of the fellows that gets his
leg pulled. I do not make anything out
of politics. I spend money. <â¢:-â¢â¢<â ; \y. yr.
Q. How do you get your leg pulled?
A. By spending money in political cam
paigns, s - .. , . _
Q. Were you playing for even on Green?
A. No, sir. I did not think Green
thought so or thinks so now.
Q. What did Mr. Green tell you when
you told him that perhaps Mr. Cosper
was waiting for an offer of six thousand
dollarsâ five or. six thousand dollars?
A. Well, he said, "I will tell you, so far
as I am concerned, I would pot give him
nor any other man a- â cent."
Q. Did ho tell you to tender his compli
ments to Mr. Cosper and tell him he was
not buying votes? â¢ 2 :y. y
A. No, sir; he did not.
Q. He did not tell you that?
A. No. sir. . - *
Q. If he testified to that fact, then It Is
Incorrect, Is it? . .
A. Yes, sir, it is. It Is not according.to
my recollection of the facts. ,-
Q. Has any messenger gone down from
Sacramento "here to see you at your home

able among millionaires, but then among
poor fellows that have to work for what
they make one hundred ' dollars or such
a matter is considerable.
Q. How much did you spend in the cam
paign? Â...-..-.
A. Well, I could not exactly tell: but It
does not concern this committee, anyhow,
because what I spent that. I was not re
imbursed for was spent in aid of the State
and county ticket and not in aid of the
legislative ticket. Every cent that I spent

three times during the campaign, did you?
A. I think as many as that.
Q. Did you not state in Tulare that you

were going back to get some more?

P Well, four or five hundred -pilars
Q Well, four or five hundred uollars
would be more than one hundred and
1 A Well, Ido not know what Senator
Linder did. If the committee wanted to
know what Senator Linder received and
what he did with it and who he got it
from, they ought to have subpenaed him.

is entirely done I want to ask a question
Â° Mr. Cosperâ Mr. Lamberson, I have been
Mr Cosperâ Mr. Lamberson, I have been
criticized somewhat through the public
press, and the statement has been made
that I had deterred you from coming
here, or something to that effect, and
had delayed the taking of your testimony
in this case. If there is anything, di
rectly or indirectly, in the way of a com
munication, express or implied,. from me
to you, that has detained or postponed
your coming to testify in this case, I
want you to tell the committee about It.
A. I "have already detailed to the com
mittee everything I know about that. I
have shown them the two dispatches and
told them of the telephonic communi
cation. That was all the communication !
that I now recall that has passed be
tween us since you cameâ since I left
Sacramento. I have never written you
a word and I have never received a word
in writing from you.
Q. Have you had any communicationâ
A. I want to say that, so far as being
deterred from coming to this place to
testify before this committee is con
cerned, that I had determined, after I
had got Into the trial of that case, to
Stay there until it was finished. 'If this
committee had sent for me with a war
rant, it would have been all the same.
I should have applied to the Judge there
for a writ of habeas corpus for my re
lease, and would have still continued to
try that . case until I got through with
It. That was my duty as I con
ceived it.
Q. Have you had any communication
from me, directly or indirectly, expressed
or implied, by which I sought to learn
what your testimony would be In this
case, or what your feeling in the matter
was?
A. Never one word in any way, shape
or manner, by â. any communication
through any messenger, by any person,
in any manner whatever.
Mr. La Bareeâ Any more questions?
Mr. Lardnerâ Just one more question.
Did you win your damage suit?
A. I got a dispatch after I arrived here
that the jury brought in a verdict for
$8000 in my favor.
Mr. Burnettâ Excuse meâ just another
question. Did you have any conversation
with Mr. Burns or with any one who pur
ported or represented himself as repre
senting Mr. Burns In regard to any vote
for Senator?;- -
Mr. Melickâ l asked that question.
The witness l have not answered any
such question as that before that I knew
of. A
. Mr. Burnettâ Well, then, I will ask the
question. Have you had any conversation
with Mr. Burns or with any one who rep
resented that he represented Mr. Burns
in regard to the Senatorial proposition or
getting votes for Senator?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. What was that? State who it was
with and what It was.
A. Well, I have had conversations with
two or three men that I know to be very
friendly with Mr. Burnsâ that is all I
know. I am not acquainted with Mr.
Burnsâ any more than I have been in
troduced to him two or three times. We
meet so seldom that our acquaintance
don't last from one Introduction to the
other.
Q. Well, tell us those conversations and
If they have any relation to the Senator
ship. . 'iy:. 'â 
A. Well, they have no relation to It any
further than that they were wanting to
know if I knew how Mr. Cosper stood on
the Senatorial question. That is about
all.
Q. Did they make any suggestions as to
securing, his vote or suggest any means
to secure his vote? .
A. No. The talk with those people was
on a line of threats. , .
Q. What were the threats? .
A. Well, Mr. Cosper would not have any
standing In the administration, or he
would not have any patronage, nor he
would not have his bills . allowed, and
everything would be against him if he
did not come into their camp.
Q. This talk. I understand, was with
friends of Mr. Burns? >-â¢;-
A. I do not. know whether they repre
sented him or not, but Just as friends;
just people that I knew were his friends.
Q. Did they say that they represented
him?
.â¢ A. No, sir. â¢>:-"-;>; J y2.-. â  â 
Q. Who were they?
! A. Well, I do not know that I care to
divulge their names. I, don't thinkâ
certainly have not' been witnesses. -
Q. It don't make any difference.
A. Is that an important matter with you
folks?
Q. It might be. -y -.'-':.-" yr -yy yy â â â â¢â â¢
A. They have not been witnesses here,
and I do not know that they had any au
thority to represent Mr. Burns at all.
They might Just simply have been talking
for the sake of talking.
Q. Were they expressing simply their
opinions?
A. Just simply their opinions; that is
all.
Q. None of them made any suggestions
as to what might be secured. for a vote?
A. Oh, no; nothing of that kind. All the
talk with those people was upon the line
that a man was putting himself In a very
bad shape If he did not vote for Dan
Burns; that he 9 was going to have the
powers down on him. â â â  - ;'â â  â 
Mr. Lardnerâ you say whether It

A BILL TO KNOCK OUT
THE PROFESSIONAL JUROR
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 27.â Senator Braunhart has
obtained from the Senate Committee on
Judiciary favorable action on his bill pro
viding for jury reform, in that his act
will have the effect, if It is adopted, of
knocking out the professional juror. nils
Is a reform which has been long looked
for.
Senator Braunhart's bill provides that
once each year the Superior Court in
every county shall designate the esti
mated number of grand and trial Jurors
required for the entire year to discharge
the business of the court. In the counties
where there are more than one Superior
Judge, each Judge shall select his -ro
rata of the total number required. No
Superior Judge can delegate the power of
selecting Jurors to,, any other person.
After persons are selected the clerk of
the court Is to examine them to ascer
tain If they are qualified to sit as jurors.
Every Judge is required to affix an affi
davit to the jury list, stating that he
personally made the selections and that
no other person assisted him. The selec
tions and listings are to be made from
persons who are on the assessment roll
of the city or county, who are of fair
character, approved integrity and sound
judgment. No person can serve as grand
Juror within two years last preceding the
selection of the grand jurors of whom he
was one.- No person shall serve as a
trial juror who has served as a regular
juror within a year preceding the selec
tion of trial jurors and no person is re
quired to serve as trial juror for more
than one month in one year, and he can
serve as such juror in not more than five
cases during the term for which he was
selected. As soon as he has served In
five cases his name is to be stricken from
the jury lists.
This law was originally designed for
San Francisco alone, but the Judiciary
Committee has so amended it as to make
it applicable to the entire State.

BURNS GETS READY
TO TURN A TRICK
Will Use the Wright Episode to Coerce
Grant.
Touts of High and Low Degree Working Hard
to Make Every Use of the Report of
the investigating Committee.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 27.â The Senatorial contest
Is the question of second importance to
night. The report of the investigating
committee holds the leading place in the
general comment, As soon as the As
sembly decides upon the degree of pun
ishment that shall be inflicted on Speaker
Wright the contest of the Senatorship vill
reopen with renewed vigor, but perhaps
on slightly different lines. :
There is an intensely bitter feeling in
the Grant camp toward the supporters
of Bulla. The report of the investigating
committee has intensified the feeling. The
Bulla men are held responsible for the re
flections cast on Grant and Green in the
report. It is charged that the followers
of the Los Angeles aspirant went out of
their way to disclose and parade calum
nies against the candidate from San Di
ego.
In the light of the report it does not
seem possible that Grant can long main
tain his present strength as a candidate
for the office of Senator. The prospect of
Grant making any gains is remote in
deed. It is, therefore, argued that some
thing of importance will happen early
next week. The shrewdest politicians In
cline to the belief that the disintegration
of the Grant forces Is inevitable and can
not be delayed much longer.
The quiet which reigns in the camp of
Colonel Burns is ominous of another gold
brick. The touts are smooth and gracious
âso polite that one is apt to fancy that
they have been attending a lecture on the
art of conciliating political adversaries.
Everybody in the Burns camp takes his
cue from the cofonel. When Dan passes
the word out in the morning that the
touts must put on a bold front and claim
everything In sight, the bold front is es
tablished and the claim advanced with a
tone of sincerity that deceives the unsus
pecting. To-day the colonel must have
patsed the word along his line for the
touts to outdo themselves in demonstra
tions of respect toward the friends of
rival aspirants. The wary suspect that
the colonel is planning a surprise. The
movement which he Intends to spring may
take the form of still another attempt to
secure a caucus, or it may be put in the
form of an Invitation for the leading men
of the party in the Legislature to submit
suggestions for promoting harmony and
bringing about the speedy election of a
Republican Senator to be named by Burns
and his army of touts.
The indications to-night are that the
ASSEMBLY ROUTINE
ENLIVENED BY SANFORD
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â Assemblyman Sanford
of Mendocino had a hard battle in the*
Assembly this afternoon to accomplish
legislation beneficial to the hundreds of
laboring men in his county, but he fought
it to a finish and won out. Bills 84 and 85
were both passed.
Bill 84 provides that every lumber com
pany In the State shall designate a period
of time not less than one hour in each day
for the midday meal of its employes. Dis
obedience of the law is punishable by a
fine of not more than $100 nor less than
$50, or by imprisonment for not more than
fifty nor less than thirty days.
Up In Mendocino County, according to
Mr. Sanford. the only time the men have
to cat is when a saw breaks or the crew
Is cab'ed out to read the latest blacklist.
Bill 85 provides against the blacklist. It
says thai' no corporation or company shall
blacklist or publish any mechanic or la
borer who .bas been either discharged or
has voluntarily left the employ of the
company, and that no company-shall con
spire or contrive by correspondence or
otherwise to prevent any such employe
from getting other employment.
Infraction of the law is a felony pun
ishable by a fine ,of not more than $1000
noy less than $500, '0r by imprisonment for
not less than sixty days nor more than
one year.
There were only,-' two measures on the
special order file. One was the constitu 7
tional amendment' proposed by McDonald
of Alameda to except all churches and
chapels and the ground upon which they
6tand from taxation. It went over to
Tuesday next. "
The other was Senate joint resolution
10, which dealt in glittering generalities
anent the Nicaragua canal. Assembly
man Camlnettl called attention to the fact
that the resolution said nothing about the
ownership and operation of the canal by
the United States, and it was promptly
flefeated.
Rickard of San Francisco made a short
explanation of Assembly bill 23, relative
to the destruction or obliteration of trade
marks on casks, bottles and other pack
ages, and the bill passed without dissent.
California had some trouble in acquir
ing the golden poppy as the official State
posy. Assembly bill 2119 is an act "to se
lect and adopt the golden poppy, etc."
Wade of Napa asked what would be done
â¢vith the thing if adopted, and every one
else on the floor wanted to know about
It, and finally Bliss of Alameda, who in
troduced the bill, had to acknowledge it
was only a fad. His confession effected
the passage of his measure.
Bill 136. by Knights of Sacramento,
which appropriates $69,500 for a home for
Governor Gage and his successors, came
ap on third reading and was passed.
The bill by which Arnerich , of Santa
Clara proposes to get $10,000 of the State's
money with which to buy' "predaceous
Insects" created a lot of warm discussion.
Caminetti said he thought there was a
"bug" in the bill and Johnson of Sacra
mento said there were enough parasite's
In the State treasury as it is. Arnerich
explained that it is the mission In the
life of the "predaceous insect" to kill off
ill scale and insect pests harmful to fruit
trees and vines and that they could only
De bought in Australia, New Zealand and
the Hawaiian Islands. His bill was
passed.
After the passage of a half dozen less
important measures the third reading file
pave way to the second and the drone
of Clerk Kyle's untuneful voice fell on
anheedlng ears until the Assembly finally
idjourned for the day.
WORKS' ANTICARTOON
BILL WAS PASSED
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â The . so-called Works
Jill passed the Assembly to-day by a vote
Â»f 43 to 14. The bill has for its unkind in
tention the suppression of newspaper car
toon, caricatures and portraits, and was
introduced in the Assembly by young Mr.
{Vbrks of San Diego for the sole purpose
>f satisfying the petty personal spite of
3 rove L. Johnson of Sacramento. That
!he bill was not drafted to fill a crying
iced for such enactment is demonstrated
n the fact that the fourteen votes cast
â¢gainst It were donated by legislators
who have been caricatured repeatedly
lince they came up here to make laws.
The votes in favor of it were nearly
ill thrown by members who have as yet
lot come prominently enough under the
>Ã¼blic eye to warrant the artists' atten
i.m. or who have been made to fear for
â¢Jie future of bills of their own by the in
3uence Johnson swings as chairman of
_" Judiciary Committee.
No one who knows the finicky member
colonel will put in his time working for
a caucus while the Assemblymen are en
grossed in the discussion of the committee
of investigation. The plans of Burns so
far as disclosed by the attitude of his fol
lowers indicate that he will not deal
harshly with the Grant forces in the mat
ter of the committee report if such action
will gain for him an advantage.
Time will be given for the Grant men
to meet the conclusions of the committee
and present argument to prove that the
findings are false and the conclusions im
proper. A tacit agreement was made to
day when Dibble was in the chair that
the debate on the report would not be
pressed at 11 o'clock to-morrow if the
Grant men were not ready at that time
to proceed with the discussion. There was
implied consent that the whole subject
matter should be postponed until next
Monday if the followers of Grant in the
Assembly should desire such extension of
time.
The Inference is straight that Burns will
not sacrifice Wright if the sacrifice can be
avoided. In the first place. Burns cannot
afford to lose a vote. The vote of Wright
counts just as much as the vote of a
member upon whom there is no stain of
disgrace. Burns is quoted as saying that
he will not seek to interfere with the
action of the Assembly in the Wright
case.
From other sources it is ascertained
that some members of the Assembly who
have been voting for Burns will not sup
port a resolution to either expel or depose
the Speaker. Sympathy for the Speaker
is counted on to defeat a resolution to
depose him. In the colonel's camp the
sympathy is allied with a desire to save
the Speaker's vote.
The Republicans will fight out the bat
tle on the floor of the Assembly.
To-night Judge Dibble said that he did
not expect to call a caucus on the sub
ject of the report. The Democrats will
doubtless participate in the contest on the
floor and demand the adoption of a reso
lution to depose the Speaker, if a reso
lution to expel him cannot be adopted.
The efforts of the Burns men will be
directed toward a disintegration of tho
Grant forces. If delay will accomplish
this end tactics of delay will be em
ployed. Should the Grant men be par
ticularly desirous of concessions to save
the name of Grant from the stain of
legislative censure the Burns men may
drive a bargain in this respect, but it will
be a hard bargain on the basis of a cau
cus agreement. It is admitted to-night
that the situation gives Burns a chance
to turn a trick. Up to date he has had
ten workers in the field to every one that
any other candidate could muster, but
his campaign has dragged along without
any sign of success.
from Sacramento, however, will have !
aught but sympathy for him. Probably
no public man in the State has less to j
thank the general press for than he.
Cartoons and the reporters made pub
lic his unholy connection with the South
ern Pacific when he was in Congress as a
Representative from California, and it
was the publicity given him and his
methods at that time that lost his job
with Uncle Collls' layout.
The same publicity and same pictures
also made the profitable practice of the j
law responsible for -him during his lim
ited career in San Francisco after his
spectacular proceedings in the infamous
Martin case. Likewise, they have cut
down his former large practice here in
Sacramento and forced him from the dig
nity of Congress to the opera bouffe of
the present Legislature.
Sympathy is wholly with Mr. Johnson.
The wonder Is he has found so many to
pander to his personal spite.
Young Mr. Works, who acts simply as
the catspaw, made no speech nor expla
nation of his bill when it came up to-day
in its regular order on the file. The infant '
protege of this year's Assembly simply |
made another bid for popularity by offer- ;
ing a resolution barring lobbyists from j
the floor. Nobody made a speech at all. i
The house for the most part got up and !
made a quiet sneak for the corridor to I
escape voting either one way or the other,
and just enough were left to do business I
with.
Assemblyman Cowan of Santa Rosa
cast his vote aye when his turn came, but
got up later, changed It to no and gave
notice he would move for reconsideration
to-morrow. McDonald of Alameda voted
aye with the same intention, but Cowan
headed him off and he. was obliged to go
on record in favor of the bilL
The whole matter will come on again
to-morrow in regular order.
THE DAY'S HAPPENINGS
IN. THE SENATE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â Senator Dickinson's
bill to prevent the fraudulent sale of bo
gus butter was finally passed by the Sen
ate to-day. It is a measure in the inter
est of pure food.
The substance of the bill was given ln
The Call a few days ago.
Senator Dickinson's bill providing for
the settlement of armory rents and other
bills of the National Guard was placed on
the file. The Senator explained that the
money to pay the bills had been already
voted, and his bill merely provided the
machinery by which could be determined
the amount of just claims.
Senator Shortridge did not want As
sembly messages read when the clerk ar
rived with them. He wanted them filed
with the secretary and taken up at the
Senate's leisure. It was explained to the
Senator that this would be disrespect of
the Assembly. '_
Petitions from Amador and Los Ange
les counties asking for the passage of the
Sunday law were presented and referred
to the Committee on Public Morals.
The Senate Committee on Judiciary was
requested to report as to the constitu
tionality of that clause of the county gov
ernment act regarding the appointment
of deputies by county officers.
Braunhart's Railroad Bill.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â Senator Braunhart to
day introduced in the Senate his substi
tute for the bill introduced by Senator
Simpson, enabling railroad corporations
operating under the Federal as well as
the State law to consolidate and be op
erated under one corporate 4 name, with
one set of officers and one system of ac
counts. This same bill is before the
Senate Committee on Corporations now,
having been presented by Senator Braun
hart as a substitute for the Simpson
measure at the last meeting of the com
mittee. It now goes to the same com
mltee as an original bill. The main fea
ture of Braunhart's substitute is that It
provides that the consolidation act shall
expire within three years after It goes

ments have been completed and naid for.
Bill 231 provides for the establishment

An Assembly constitutional amendment

A MINORITY REPORT
FOR ANDERSON'S BILL
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA- J
MENTO, Jan. 27.â That junketing trip
to Folsom indulged in by the commit- i
tees on State prisons and capital and
labor did not result in a unanimous
decision against Anderson's anti-rock
crusher bill after all. A strong minded
minority has developed in Assembly
men Kenneally, Hoey and Henry, and
it has a report ready recommending the j
passage of the Anderson bill as amend
ed by. Dibble of San Francisco, who â 
has backed Anderson in his fight for
free labor from the start. Although j
the committee is not a unit on the ques- j
tion of the prison crushed rock it is on |
the proposition of allowing the State
prisons to manufacture other articles
that, will come in direct competition
with State made goods. The fight the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Associ
ation has begun against the bill by
which Senator Edward I. Wolfe of San i
Francisco hopes to install in Folsom !
wire nail making machinery is prac
tically already won.
Oscar Lewis, who represents the as
sociation, was present at the little din- j
ncr given by Warden Aull when the '
committees called on him Wednesday j
afternoon, and he told them of Wolfe's |
intention. They declared unanimously j
that they would never stand for any i
such proposition. They said so pub
licly this morning, after The Call's ex- '
pose of Wolfe's intentions had been j
read in the Assembly chamber. The
fact was developed to-day that wire
nail making is not the only competitive !
industry that is contemplated in the |
penitentiary curriculum, but that the i
old hat and cap bill is to make its an- I
nual appearance again shortly after
the Wolfe bill is sprung.
Both majority and minority reports
on the rock crusher bill will be submit- !
ted to the Assembly to-morrow.
Charities and Corrections.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 27.â Senator Luchsinger has
introduced a bill to establish a State
Board of Charities and Corrections. It is
to consist of six persons to be appointed
by the Governor, two to serve one year,
two for two years and two for three
years. This limitation applies to the first
board appointment. After the terms of
the members of the first board expire
the term of all six of the members shall
be for three years.
Regular meetings of the board are to be
held quarterly at Sacramento. The board
shall investigate, examine and report on
charitable and correctional institutions in
the State, whether they be under county
or State control.
All plans for new jails, workhouses,
children's homes, hospitals, for addjtion
to or alterations of existing institutions,
are to be submitted to the board, for criti

"DEATH TO JEWS!"
THE CRY OF A MOB
IN STREETS OF PARIS
HEADED IV A CRIPPLE WHO
Has Nailed Feet.
IN SPITE OF COLD WEATHER
ANTI-SEMITE RIOTS CAUSED
BY THE SUIT BROUGHT
BY HENRY'S WIDOW.
Prominent Among Those Who
cipate in the Demonstratioi
Deputy Marcel-Hahart,
Who Was Boulan-
ger's Friend.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Jan. 27.â The trial of the ac
tion brought by Mme. Henry, widow of
Lieutenant Colonel Henry, who com
mitted suicide in prison here, after con
fessing to having forged one of the
documents in the Dreyfus case, against
M. Joseph Reinach, a member of the
Chamber of Deputies and editor of the
Republique Francaise, for libeling the
deceased In declaring him a traitor,
opened in the Assize Court to-day.
Mme. Henry, who was dressed in deep
mourning, was present.
There was great animation in the lob
bies of the Palace of Justice, but the
neighborhood of the palace was quiet
until 2 o'clock, when a mob, headed by
a cripple known as "Libertad," who
was on crutches and had naked feet In
spite of the cold, and a band of anti-
Semites, led by M. Gherin, president of
the Anti-Semite League, entered the
Place Dauphine at the back of the Pal
ace of Justice and began shouting. The
police cleared the square and placed a
cordon around it: The crowd cheered
for the army and shouted: "Death to
the Jews!" â¢
After the anti-Semite mob had been
driven from the neighborhood of the
court they re-formed on the Place dv
Chatlett, howling "Spit on the Jews!"
and cheering for the army. A fight
followed, during which several persons
were injured, and the rioters were
again scattered.
M. Marcel-Habart, member of the
Chamber of Deputies, a friend of the
late General Boulanger, was prominent
among the manifestants.
M. Laborie, counsel for M. Reinach,
asked the court to postpone the trial
until the Dreyfus inquiry was ter
minated. He declared the suit was
merely the work of a political party
reduced to the last extremities and
that it was merely a desperate attempt
to influence the verdict of the Court of
Cassation in its revision of the Drey
fus trial.
M. I St. ' Aubln, counsel for Mme.
Henry, replied, violently attacking
M. Reinach. He insisted that all the
witnesses were present i and that M.
Keipach should' give the proofs of his
assertions,' as he had promised to do.
M. Laborie * wished to reply, and
there was a sharp passage at arms be
tween him and the Judge, who refused
to allow him to reply, and called upon
the advocate general, M. Lombard, to
speak.
The latter opposed M. Laborie's appli
cation, and M. Laborie again urged an
adjournment of the case in order to
spare the country "useless agitation,"
adding, amid murmurs in court, that
even if an adjournment was refused a
hearing could not take place after the
court had given Its decision, and he
(M. Laborie) had given notice of an
appeal to the Court of Cassation. .
M. Laborie declared that M. Reinach
desired to have the action thoroughly
thrashed out, but, he added, owing to
the fact that the diplomatic and mili
tary witnesses were riot relieved from
the restrictions of professional secrecy,
a hearing of the case now could only
be abortive, as in the case of the trial
of M. Emile Zola.
The court rejected M. Laborie's mo
tion, whereupon he lodged an appeal
to the Court of Cassation.
* Subsequently the court decided to ad
journ proceedings until the Court of
Cassation had passed upon M. La
borie's appeal.
TO RECLAIM SWAMP'
LAND IN YOLO COUNTY
Project Which Will Permit of the
Cultivation of a Fertile
Tract. .
. WOODLAND, Jan. 27â some
months past there has been an agitation
among the owners of swamp and over
flowed lands ln the extreme southeastern
portion of Yolo County to form a reclam
ation district, and the proposition receiv
ed such encouragement that a surveyor
was recently employed to make the pre
liminary surveys with a view to ascer
taining- the cost of reclaiming the lands.
The formation of the proposed district
would be a great benefit to Yolo County,
especially in the matter of increasing the
assessment roll and lowering the tax rate.
At the present time this vast area is as
sessed at a nominal figure, because it is
impossible to produce crops of any kind
when the rainfall is normal, as it is in
variably flooded. The land is very pro
ductive, and if it is reclaimed immense
crops of grain, fruit and all kinds of gar
den truck could be raised, and the in
crease in value of the land would be enor
mous. '
According to the preliminary plans map
ped out by the persons interested, the rec
lamation work should commence at the
lower end of the Lisbon District on the
Sacramento River, running south to Minor
Slough, thence along Minor Slough to
Haas Slough, thence along Haas Slough
to Barnhart Landing, which is situated
near Maine Prairie in Solano County. If
the work of building levees along the pro
posed route proves successful and the
land inclosed is protected from flood
waters, thousands of acres outside of the
proposed district will also be reclaimed,
in fact, the reclamation df the land In the
proposed district means the reclamation
of almost the entire southeastern portion
of the county.
The most prominent promoters of the
enterprise are Williams &Bixby, a wealthy
San Francisco firm, which -. owns .22,000
acres, also the owners of the Mound
ranch, consisting of 6120 acres, and the
Barnhart estate with 4000 acres. John
Treathaway of Stockton owns 5680 acres
and there are numeous others owning
tracts of land ranging from 160 to 1000
.acres. ' >.r,-.v-
SAN JOSE-ALVISO
ROAD IS ASSURED
Board of Trade of the Garden City
Pledges Its Support to the
; â¢:; Project.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 27.â The Board of
Trade this evening Indorsed and pledged
its assistance and co-operation in build
ing a railroad between .this" city and Al
viso. The proposition made by the Santa
Clara Valley Railway Company-asking
for stock subscriptions amounting to $15,
--000 was enthusiastically j received, and ; the
.directors were confident : there would :>' be
no trouble in raising the money needed to
build the road. The opinion was ex
pressed that it could be done In a week.
Rights of way have been purchased, the
survey made and rails and track material
are now stored at Alviso. Over $50,000 has
already been put into the project, and
about $30,000 more is needed to equip the
road. Business men are asked to sub
scribe $15,000 and the company will put un
the same amount. A. E. Proyor, manager
of the road, and H. P. Thayer addressed
the board to-night and explained the sit
uation. The City Council and Board of
Supervisors will be asked to aid in pro
moting the completion of the road.
CORPORATION SEEKS TO
CONTROL PIT RIVER
Wants an Absolute Monopoly in the
Floating of Wood Down the
Stream.
REDDING, Jan. 27.â A proposition that
has thorougly aroused the owners of
claims on the sulphide belt of Shasta
County has just come to light. It is a
scheme to secure exclusive control of Pit
River for the purpose of floating wood
down the stream, to be used as fuel by
the smelters. The Mountain Copper Com
pany draws nearly its entire supply of
pine fuel from this source, and the firm
which is now under contract to the com
pany is seeking to secure an exclusive
franchise to the Pit waterway, and will
make application to the Federal Govern
ment for a charter to run for a period of
ninety-nine years.
Should this scheme be consummated It
will have the effect of converting the in
dustry of floating fuei to the denuded
mining districts of this county Into an
absolute monopoly, shutting out other
mining companies in the copper zone from
securing pine fuel except by paying a
heavy tribute to the beneficiaries of the
franchise. The miners regard Pit River
as a public utility that should not be al
lowed to pass into the exclusive control
of individuals. . They can see no reason
why a franchise should be sought or
granted, unless it be desired to confer an
immense advantage upon the grantees.
High up on Pit River are immense
bodies of pine timber. From the plateau
lands chutes are built to the water's
edge and cordwood shot into the river at
trifling expense, floated down the stream,
boomed and taken from the river at any
point desired. An unlimited supply of
cheap fuel is thus accessible to large
consumers, making the smelting industry
possible as well as profitable in a country
barren for the present of marketaole
coal. The Mountain Copper Company
alone uses annually from 15,000 to 20,000
cords of wood. _ -

COLLUM WILL NOT
STAND TRIAL AGAIN
Dismissal of the Case Against the
Woodland Man Accused of
Arson.
WOODLAND, Jan. 27.â The case of Phil
Collum, charged with arson, was called
in the Superior Court to-day, Judge
Buckles presiding, to be reset for trial, in
compliance with the recent decision of
the Supreme Court setting aside the ver
dict of the jury in the former trial and
granting the defendant a new trial. Dis
trict Attorney Bush appeared for the peo
ple, and Attorney R. Clark represented
the prisoner.
I Mr. Bush addressed the court, giving a
brief history of the case and said he re
alized that to try the defendant again
would be a useless expense to the county,
as he did not believe it possible to gather
sufficient evidence to convince a jury be
yond a reasonable doubt that Collum was
guilty, since the Supreme Court had
stricken out some of the most damaging
testimony against the defendant. Be
sides, a number of the important wit
nesses have moved- away since the for
mer trial and their whereabouts was un
known. Under these circumstances Mr.
Bush moved the court to dismiss the case.
Attorney Clark offered no objections and
Judge Buckles ordered that the case be
dismissed and the defendant discharged
from custody.
Collum was arrested on April 22, 1897,
tried and convicted and sent to the State
prison at. Folsom on September 15, 1897,
to serve a five-year sentence. The case
was appealed. and the .Supreme Court
granted a new trial. In all, his incar
ceration amounted- to about. twenty-two
months,; which; is equal to a sentence of
more than two years, allowing for credits
for good behavior. *â >*;.; ;',-"*. v % ..; Â . !â

LUDLOW QUARRELS
WITH GEN. MILES
Not So Heated as Gen
eral Eagan;
SAYS HE WANTS. JUSTICE
HAD NO ORDERS CONCERNING
TRANSPORTATION.
When They Came He Said He Wou.d
Not Accept the Responsibility
for Them.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. There was not
a witness before the war investigating
commission to-day, but the commission
received and gave out an affidavit from
General Ludlow, now military Governor
of Havana, which the general had for
warded in lieu of personally appearing
In Washington. The typewritten affi
davit was principally in answer to the
statements of General Miles before the
commission in reference to the lack of
preparation made by the engineer corps,
of which he (Ludlow) had been the chief
officer in the field.
General Ludlow says: ' _ newspaper
clippings sent to me by friends indicate
correctly the nature of General Miles'
statements and of the responsibility
which Is therein made to attach to me
for any shortcomings that may be sup
posed to have existed in connection with
the embarcation and disembarcatlon of
the Santiago expedition, I beg leave, dis
claiming all intention of disrespect, to
express surprise at the statements made."
General Ludlow incorporates in his
statement a report of a rather warm con
troversy he had with General Miles at the
army headquarters in Washington after
the return from Montauk, in which Gen
eral Miles had said that General Lud
low's "fighting at Santiago was very
good, but his engineering was very bad.
General Ludlow said that he refuted
this statement at the time, pointing out
that he had done all the engineering
work that the time and circumstances
permitted; that the Santiago expedition
was not an engineering campaign but a
race between the physical endurance of
the army and the Cuban malaria, and
that if the "army had stopped to build
railroads and bridges It would have been
on its back before the surrender instead
of after."
\ In conclusion General Ludlow requested
that the commission should give his state
ment as much publicity as the statement
of General Miles. . . . â¢

Congressman . Loud Mentioned for a
General Appraisership.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 27.â Senator
Perkins to-day Introduced a bill appropri
ating $50,000 for the Mechanics' Institute
Exposit on. ':â¢ v
Representative Loud of California has
been mentioned for one of the vacancies
on the United States Board of General
Appraisers. The President recently
called for and received the resignations
of three members of the board. Loud is
regarded as being peculiarly qualified for
the position by his unquestioned integrity,
his judicial temperament and. his general
knowledge of matters coming before the
board for adjudication, gained by his long
experience in Congress and his familiarity
with public questions. The annual salary
of this office is $7000, and the tenure prac
tically for life. Notwithstanding the al
lurements of the place, it is not thought
Loud would accept. His prominence and
influence in Congress increases with his
years of service, and as chairman of the
Postoffice Committee in the House he is
especially valuable to legislators. With a
reasonable hope of continuance in Con
gressional life, engaged in important and
congenial work, and with his long identi
fication with the interests- of the Pacific
Coast, it is not believed* he would ex
change his present place for one that
would compel him to reside in New York.
The pension office has notified Repre
sentative Barlow that a pension has been
granted to Edward P. Wells of Pasadena.
He will receive $400 back pay.

TO DISMISSAL
FROM THE ARMY
Court=Martial Finds the Commissary
General Guilty of the Charges
Preferred.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27. â The Herald's Washington correspondent sends the follow
ing: "And the court did thereupon sentence him, the said Brigadier General Charles P.
Eagan, commissary general of subsistence, to be dismissed from the military service of the
United States."
This, lam reliably informed, is the closing paragraph of the court-martial record of
General Eagan, which has been prepared, and to which Major General Merritt, president of
the court, and Colonel George R. Davis, judge advocate, will attach their signatures to-mor
row. He was found guilty on both charges, "conduct unbecoming an officer and gentle
man," and "conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline." â¢.â -'â¢â¢
Having been found guilty of the first charge, the court, in accordance with article of
war 61, had no other alternative than to - bring in a sentence of dismissal. When the court ad
journed to-day the sentence was not accompanied by any recommendation for clemency, and
it is not now considered likely that any such recommendation will be made when the record
is formally signed to-morrow. It is still within the power of the President to exercise clem
ency, and it is believed by many officers that in view of General Eagan's mental condition
the President may mitigate the sentence of dismissal to one of suspension. The record of the
court will be formally submitted to Secretary Alger to-morrow and by him referred to the
judge advocate general for review. Several days will elapse before the findings are sent to
the President, who will finally pass upon them.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â The first
witness before the Eagan court-martial
to-day was David R. McKee of this
city, for years the agent of the Asso
ciated Press. During the period be
tween the time General Miles gave his
testimony before the War Investigating
Commission and the day on which Gen
eral Eagan made his statement the
witness saw him two or three times.
He seemed careworn and much preoc
cupied. Mr. McKee said that the Im
pression General Eagan then made
upon him was that he had become in
sane.
R. A. Alger, Secretary of War, was
next called to the witness stand. He
said that he recalled a conversation he
had had with General Eagan shortly
after General Miles had given his testi
mony. General Eagan came into his
office in an excited state of mind and
said it was his wish to prefer charges
against General Miles for what he had
said.
. "I told him," testified Secretary Alger,
â "that, under the President's order
granting immunity to officers who tes
tified before the War Investigating
.-.'â¢â  Commission, he could not do so."
"Mr. Secretary, did you receive any
instructions from the President on this
point?"
"He said to me that immunity had
.been granted to witnesses."
Colonel Alexander and Colonel Davis
were recalled and said that never, dur
.'.; ing their acquaintance with the ac
.-.'. cused, had they known him to use
vulgar or profane language. He always
had been correct and clean in speech
'â¢ and never had they known him to use
.such language as was used in his state
ments before the War Commission.
Dr. W. E. Hopkins of California and
New York, General Eagan's son-in-law,
was called. He came to Washington
after General Miles had given his tes
â  timony and lived at the general's
house. He said he then observed that
General Eagan was very restless and
â¢â¢â  nervous and could not eat normally or
sleep normally. At the table he would
â¢ at times stop eating and apparently
lose himself in thought. He was in
tensely nervous and showed signs of
. congestion of certain parts of the brain.
Witness had had long talks with his
.. wife about her father, and he had told
'â¢'. her that the general must be carefully
V .watched and that they must be pre
. pared for anything. General Eagan's
''..'â¢ mind was non-receptive at this time,
â¢'.: : and the witness believed that some
thing very serious might happen. He
..' : was, the witness added, in a gloomy
'.- frame of mind in consequence of the
'. ' things that had been said about him.
?'.. He felt that his honor was destroyed
â  and he did not want to see people. Gen
y.. eral Eagan, witness further testified,
...did not want to go in a street car and
'was ashamed to meet any one, and
keenly felt his disgrace. The general
'.. -said that General Miles had destroyed
.'his honor and that his life work was
- ruined. In all the time the witness had
X known General Eagan he had not
known him to use such language as
'â â¢;. was employed in his statement.
-. . Mrs. Hopkins, the daughter of Gen
."â  eral Eagan, was the next witness, Gen-
T eral Eagan's counsel explaining that
â¢'. ".he called her against the wish of her
.';.' father and husband, and only because
â¢ he:- absence from the trial might be re
v marked upon. She said her father came
â¢ : ... home one afternoon, and, standing in
.".â¢â¢â¢' the doorway with a paper in his hand,
'â ': ' exclaimed: "General Miles has cruci
'.'â '.. fled me." The witness said she could
â : â¢ never forget that scene., and added that
.'.'â¢'since that time her father-had been a
"-â¢â  : greatly changed man. He could think
-.-" .of nothing else nor talk of anything
'."' else than that General Miles had ruined
â¢', his life. He was from that time on in
an alarming condition, and when wit
.; 'ness was compelled to go to New York
. :;' she had returned almost at once to
:â¢â¢ -help care for her father.
â¢\ In, his argument for the defense. At
â¢. torney Worthington called attention to
â¢*.' the President's public statement that
â¢ ; ;. witnesses were given immunity, and
... declared that this guarantee was
'.;â  â¢ claimed by the accused. Under the cir
cumstances, he insisted. General Eagan
-was perfectly protected against any re
sults such as have been forced upon
.him by this court. He had been ac
'.' cused of a heinous crime, and in his
.-. . 'statement to the commission had de
'â ' fended his honor and Innocence, as he
bad a perfect right to do, but using
' stronger language perhaps than he
should have used. Worthington next
' quoted : from authorities to show that
to convict the accused of conduct un
becoming an officer and a gentleman.
â¢ â¢ the offense must be such that any
â¢ brother officer who should, after his
.. ..-conviction, take him by the hand or
visit his home, or be on Intimate terms
â¢ with him, would thereby render him
self disgraced and unlit to associate
J with gentlemen and men of honor. The
â¢ indorsements of several high reviewing
officers in the United States army. .on
/the findings of courts martial, were
â¢ quoted as showing that the offense
â¢ must be exceptionally heinous and such
'â¢ as would unfit the accused for associa
" tion with right-thinking men. One case
cited was that of an officer who struck
â¢'another who was a cripple, and called
. .him a liar. General Sherman, who re
* â¢ viewed the case, disapproved the find
ings of dismissal of the court and said,
lb effect, that this penalty should 4 not
COMMISSARY GENERAL EAGAN,
be imposed except the offense unfitted
the perpetrator for the society of gen
tlemen, and while he regarded the ac
tion of the officer* as properly subjecting
him to a severe penalty, yet the ex
treme penalty of dismissal should not
be imposed.
Judge Advocate Davis closed the ar
gument and the court-martial took the
case under advisement.

TACOMA, Jan. 27.â While playing with her dog along the bank of

drowned. The body-has not been recovered, and "may. never be, be

The accident was a very peculiar one. The girl was â¢ running

CANNIBALS FEAST
ON A SHIP'S CREW
VANCOUVER, B C, Jan. 27. After escaping death by drowning,
eleven of the crew of the ship Manbare were captured and eaten by
cannibals of New Guinea. The Manbare was bound for Sydney, Aus
tralia, when it was caught in the terrible gale of December. Near
Cape Nelson it began to sink. The crew, eighteen all told, left the
vessel in two boats _nd soon became separated.
One boat containing twelve men was finally thrown ashore ten
miles from the cape. The sailors were seized by natives from the
interior and hurried off to the village of the chief. One man, James
Greene, escaped. y'-yOVy '-.--'>
: The sailors were stripped and bound and killed, one each day. A
wild orgie was participated in by at least a hundred savages, who
had gathered for the feast.
In several cases the sailors were tortured by the old women and
children of the tribe. The eyes of one were gouged out. The doomed
men stoically watched the elaborate preparations for their death. A
huge pot filled with boiling water was used for the feast, which, on
the first day, was prolonged away into the night.
In most cases the men were beheaded, their heads being stuck on
poles and paraded before the men who were to suffer the' same fate.

COMPROMISE ON
THE ARMY BILL
Chairman Hull to Offer
Amendments.
OPPOSITION TO BIG INCREASE
CAUSES THE ORIGINAL PLAN
TO BE ABANDONED.
Modification by Which It Is Proposed
to Empower the President to
Gradually Add to the
Forces.
' Special Dispatch to Ths Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.â The oppo
sition to the army reorganization bill
on the Republican side of the House
has become so strong that to-day
Chairman Hull, after Henderson of
lowa, one of the floor leaders of the
majority, had threatened to vote to re
commit the bill, decided it would be
wise, in order to secure its passage, to
abandon the idea of providing directly
for a regular army of 100,000 men. He
announced on the floor that the com
mittee would offer amendments to re
duce the number of enlisted men to
about 60,000, but lodge in the President's ;
discretion the authority to increase the j
army to a maximum of 100,000.
These amendments have been pre
pared. They provide that the Presi
dent, in his discretion, enlist only sixty
men in the companies and sixty in the
cavalry troops. By the terms of the
bill there are to be thirty infantry reg
iments of ten companies each, with a
strength of 145 men, and twelve regi
ments of cavalry of ten troops each,
with a strength of 106 men. This dis
cretion, if the President would exer
cise it, would reduce the number of en
listed men about 31,000 and practically
leave intact the organization provided
in the bill so far as officers are con
cerned. * '.--V; â¢'.â '.;â 
How far this proposed modification
will allay the opposition remains to be
seen. Johnson of Indiana, who took
a prominent part in the fight to-day
after the general debate closed, de
clared .that the purpose of the bill was
to have an army of 100,000, either by
direct authority or the exercise of the
President's discretion, and he declared
his purpose to fight to the bitter end
the machinery which was being forged
for a colonial system.
Henderson in the course of the de
bate to-day declared his belief in the
unwisdom of annexing the Philippines.
Johnson said the vital mistake was
made when the President instructed
the Peace Commissioners to demand
the cession of the Philippines. The
whole debate to-day was spirited and
so intense was the struggle when the
bill was taken up for amendment under
the five-minute rule that the first sec
tion had not been completed when the
House, at 5 o'clockk, took a recess.

the first speech Piatt has delivered in
the Senate since his return to the body.
He took strong ground for the ratifi

Rumors of Eagan's Wealth.
When' General Eagan - was giving his
testimony at the court-martial in Wash
ington his attorney asked him If he had
ever received any profit or benefit out of
the large contracts he let for army sup
plies. The general answered: "No, on my
honor, and before God, not 1 cent of profit
did I ever receive; and yet my office dis
bursed millions of dollars: and I am now
so poor that I cannot even pay your fee."
It would seem, from the foregoing state
ment that General Eagan Is almost pov
erty stricken, or at least he desires that
Impression to go abroad. : There are men
in this city who could never be convinced
that General Eagan is a bankrupt. His
son, Charles E. Eagan', Is reputed: to be
quite wealthy. He Is - treasurer of - the

mously wealthy corporation, sev

said to be one of the heaviest owners of

ing Attorney Beerstecher asked for a
continuance on the ground that Mrs.
M. Ray of San Francisco, one of the
most Important witnesses, was too ill
to attend. District Attorney Bell op
posed the motion, and in arguing for it
Beerstecher with some heat charged his
adversary with trying to run the case
from end to end the prosecution, the
Judge and the defense. This Bell de
nied with equal show of feeling. With
out making any ruling on the question
of a continuance the Justice, delivered
himself thus:
I have read the testimony taken at the
Coroner's Inquest. I have read all ' tne
evidence taken in that proceeding, an
have read the verdict of the Coroner's
jury, and I know what the evidence was
before me yesterday morning. It was
simply a rehash of the evidence given to
the Coroner's jury and a poor one at that.
It is no evidence to me. It is no evidence
by -which I can hold the prisoner.
The District Attorney objected â¢to the
tetstlmony of the last witness, and I ruled
that It was not the time after you (mean
ing the District Attorney) had your last
witness on the stand to object to the evi
dence for the defense. When you said'
"we will rest our case" then you deprived
the defense of a chance to be heard.

NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald sends
the following:
: "Situation improving. Less excite
ment prevailing."
These two sentences were read to me
late this afternoon by Secretary Alger
from a dispatch received from Major
General Otis containing about 500
words. The Secretary added that Gen
eral Otis' advices were very encourag
ing and another Cabinet official with
whom I talked declared his conviction
that .the pacificatory policy of the ad
ministration would win the day.
"The* policy of the President will not
be changed," he continued, "until after
the ratification of the treaty of peace."
Secretary Alger ridiculed to-day the
story published this morning showing
the administration had intercepted a
dispatch sent to the Philippine junta at
Hongkong by Agoncillo and it was un
able to find any official of the admin
istration who knew anything about it.
It' was reported this afternoon that
the administration had determined: to
prevent his messages , reaching Manila
and that General Greely, chief signal
officer, ". had instructed Colonel Thomp
son, signal officer at Manila, to prevent
Agoncillo's "alleged dispatch reaching
the insurgents : in Luzon. A high au
thority denied that any such dispatch
had been sent. A message was sent to
Colonel Thompson â¢ by General Greely
relating to stricter censorship to be im
posed, but I was told the name of Ag
oncillo was not mentioned nor was any
reference made to . the 2 dispatch which
he is alleged to have sent to Hongkong
and which ' the Government is said to
have intercepted. : . v
â¢ The President is determined not to .
Institute " any proceedings against â¢ Ag- .
oncillo at this time and thus create for
him in this country sympathy which he
I will say this: You think I didn't un
derstand what you meant, but I un
derstand a good deal more than the law
yers about this and other things.
If I hold this man to answer I must
hold him by the evidence before me, and
by nothing that I know . about the per
sons or things connected with this mat
ter, whether it be the testimony given be
fore the Coroner's inquest, the Coroner's
verdict or public opinion. I must: hold
him only by what has been shown in evi
dence before me. I don't care for what
the Supreme Court may have said a hun
dred years ago. .
If I should hold Mr. Walters under the
evidence I have now, and the Superior.
Court should be appealed to. for a writ of
habeas corpus, he would be released. Now,
you know what I think about it. I state
this not as a lawyer, but as _ man of com
mon-sense. There is not evidence enough
before me to hold Mr. Walters. I want
some evidence outside of what I know of
this case before me.
Attorney Beerstecher took prompt ad
vantage of the opening made by the
court. > '-
"If your honor please," he said, "in
order to facilitate this matter, and as
the District Attorney is very anxious
not to have a continuance in the mat
ter, and as the District Attorney has
stated to the court that he rested his
case, and as his case is therefore closed
absolutely for the purposes of this ex
amination, we will also rest our case
and have decided to produce no evi
dence on behalf of the defense. I ask
the court to make your order, whatever
that may be, whether you will hold the
defendant or not."
District Attorney Bell asked the priv
ilege of arguing the matter ' efore 'the
court made his order and the Justice
agreed to hear him, but not before he
had freed his mind of the following
sentiments: * yy ry â ;?.'
You have not satisfied my mind that I
would be justified In holding the defend
ant. It appeared to me that you j acted
toward the defense as If you had said,
"We have got you in a hole and we will
keep you there." I refer to the manner
in which the witness Grigsby was turned
over to the defense. Whatever I think of
the guilt or innocence of the defendant, I
can't go against my conscience. I don't
think the defense has had a fair show.
Bell argued the matter, for nearly an
hour. Beerstecher followed -and at
tempted to quote some law for the in
formation of the court, but he was
does not deserve. It is also pointed out
that his arrest and deportation might
precipitate trouble in the Philippines.
But his immunity at this time does
not extend beyond the day when' the
treaty of peace is ratified. At present
Agoncillo, is a Spanish subject and an
armistice exists which prevents the
Government operating against Spain or
her subjects. When the treaty of peace
is -ratified his nationality becomes
American and should be commit! any
acts of an Incendiary character he may
be tried by court-martial and suffer the
extreme penalty, death, if his offenses
should be of sufficient gravity. I un
derstand the authorities considered the
advisability of sending him his pass
ports, but they were fearful that this
might be construed as recognition of his
diplomatic capacity and it has been de
cided to ignore him for the present at
least. In the meantime sharp surveil
lance will be maintained.
DOES TREASON LURK
IN ALGER'S OFFICE
\ WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 27.â
cret service agents of the Treasury De
partment are . carefully watching the
members of the Filipino Junta in Wash
ington. A detective visited The Call's
Washington office a few days ago to
secure certain pictures of these Fili
pinos, printed in that paper when they
arrived in San Francisco. Just why
they wanted this picture Is not appar
ent.
' The startling report was In circula

concerning the Philippines, * the infor

checked by his Honor, who paid this
eulogy to the Supreme Court:
I have my private opinion of the Su
preme Court. You can read twenty de
cisions on your side of. the case and Mr
Bell can read twenty on his side. It
don't make any difference to me what the
Supreme Court's opinions are; I simply
obey them as law. They make no impres
sion on me as a man. I have my own
opinions.
Bell concluded the argument and this
was the rather unexpected decision of
the court:
I shall do my duty as a committing
magistrate. I want to say this: I be
lieve from the law I am obliged to hold
â  the defendant to answer, but Mr. Walters
j has had no chance for a defense. I say
that It is the fault of the law. It is not
the fault of the District Attorney and not
the fault of any, one, but the law is not
always justice, and I say that under the
| law I am obliged to hold Mr. Walters to
answer. It is all against my sense of de
cency, justice' and fairness. I hold him
i according to law. Mr. William Bradford
, does not hold him to answer.
j Beerstecher asked that the defendant
be admitted to bail, which was opposed
jby Bell. Here the court again found
i an opportunity to make a faux pas,
and did not neglect it.
"Under. the decision of the Supreme
Court," said his Honor, "I refuse to ad
mit Mr. Walters to bail. I am for it.
but I am obliged to do it according to
law, although as Mr. Bradford I be
lieve the man ought to go free."
This caused murmuring in the court-
I room, and the Justice endeavored to
! reinstate himself in the good opinion of
j his hearers.
"No, I don't mean that," he quickly
added. "I take those last words back."
The commitiment was duly made out
and Walters was returned to his cell.
After court adjourned Attorney Beer
stecher said he would immediately be
gin preparations for habeas corpus pro
ceedings in behalf of his client and ex
pected to file his application for a writ

ADVEBTISEMENTS.
There are three periods in all lifeâ the
time of the bud. of the flower and of the
perfect fruit. it is thus that girlhood
emerges into womanhood and womanhood
into motherhood. Almost all of the ills
from which women suffer have their incep-
tion in weakness and disease of the femi-
nine organism, which bears the burdens of
wifehood and motherhood. These disor*
ders usually begin with puberty, childbirth
or with the "turn of life." Thousands of
women suffer silently for years in this way,
rather than undergo the examinations and
local treatment insisted upon by the major-
ity of physicians. This is unnecessary.
An eminent and skillful specialist, Dr.
R. V. Pierce, for thirty yeara chief consult-
ing physician to the Invalids' Hotel and
Surgical Institute, at Buffalo, -N. V., ; long
â since discovered a wonderful medicine
that will cure all troubles of this nature
in the privacy of the home. This medi-
cine is known as Dr. Pierces Favorite Pre-
scription. It acts directly on the delicate
and iniporant organs that make wifehood
and motherhood possible. - It makes them
strong, healthy and vigorous. It allays in-
flammation, heals ulceration, soothes pain
and tones up the nerves. It banishes the
indispositions of the period of impending
maternity, and makes baby's advent easy
and almost painless. It transforms weak,
â  sickly, nervous invalids into happy, healthy
wives and mothers, All good medicine
dealers sell it, and no honest dealer will
urge a substitute upon you. -

EXTEND THE SEfIWfILL.
ONE of the measures which commends itself to
the judgment is that introduced by Senator
Braunhart relative to the extension of the
seawall southward.
That there is necessity for more wharfage is be
coming more evident day by day, and that the extra
space should be well within the bay is equally clear.
Th. Braunhart measure seems to leave little to be
'.desired. It provides, not only for the. wall, but the
establishment of the fund by which the improvement
may be maintained/ and submission of the scheme to
a vtote of the people. There' -"can hardly be a doubt
that the wall will be "constructed, for the need of it
is palpable. ". '* \-%r "
Tlie maritime business of San Francisco is on the
[increase. There has been, particularly since the
growth of the Government's transport business,
serious embarrassment for wharf room. There is
: no-treason why ships should be obliged to anchor in
-'..'; the,.Â£trÂ§am ,and wait alliance to get .to the dock. The
.... delay jnvolved-is costly and wasteful. â¢ San Francisco
â¢ has perhaps the finest natural harbor in the world.
./Every, advantage should be taken of the fact, and the
, extension advocated by Senator Braunhart cannot
reasonably meet with opposition. It is something de
manded imperatively by the tendency of the city to
grow. Every improvement on the water front is a
distinct benefit - to the whole city, and here is a
. scheme" of improvement which means much to the
municipality.
â¢ The bill, we understand, has passed the Senate, and
it should .not- meet with opposition either in the other
House or at the - hands of the executive.
HASTENING THE MILLENNIAL DAWN
THERE exists the possibility that Assemblyman
Caminetti is a joker; if he is not, he is a joke.
His plan for hastening the millennial dawn shows
signs, of having been conceived while the gentleman
was in a- happy dream concerning the time when sin
shall be no more. He wants candidates to be for
bidden by law to treat anybody to a cigar, a drink,
even of sodawater, and then to swear that the com
paign 'has "been conducted without resort to such
wicked devices.
There is a law now which provides that every can
didate must, under oath set forth his expenditures.
These statements are filed promptly enough, but no-
body is expected to believe them, and nobody does.
:.Whh 'the Caminetti bill a law, the unhappy candi
. date would simply have to swear a little harder.
y Wh__*___â _ state of morals exists as will permit a
.. -candidate to wage a campaign without buying a few
.-.'cabbage leaves and "smiling" with his friends there
. ; Will be' no need of any law on the matter, for the
â  -. millennium will be here, and drinking and smoking
â¢ have become things of the past.
:..- It is not to be anticipated that the measure will
'.'-'pass. It ought not to, for it would, if it could be en
"" forced; work a great hardship 'upon the worthy army
â¢, of touts ''to whom politics is a business, and who, but

NOT DICKINSON'S BILL.
THROUGH inadvertence, the introduction of
the -remarkable Senate bill authorizing the
slaughter of journalists was ascribed to Sen
ator -Dickinson. It should have been credited to Sen
ator Morehouse. The -Senator' from Santa Clara
thinks the newspapers have not treated him with the
deference due. his. character and worth. The value of
his -opinion is not under discussion here. Anyhow,
' Morehouse is the genius who thought out and
â¢promulgated the scheme of an open season for
'.writers and artists. An apology is due the Senator
v from Marin.

HOWARD E. WRIGHT'S EXAMPLE.
THE name of Howard E. Wright flares like a
beacon before the young men of California, into
i whose hands its development is about to pass.
The restiveness of the people against political corrup
tion has been manifested for years. That form of
dishonesty has been very general and very rank, but
it could not be permanently endured in a State, mighty
within itself, facing the Pacific, which is the world's
I arena for the twentieth century, and producing a
i high type of womanhood and of manhood, in which
moral perception is the necessary accompaniment of
intellectual breadth.
Within the last few years much has been done in
this State to spread the knowledge of the elements of
true citizenship. Among other things, able and
learned men, many of them connected with our State
universities, have delivered courses of lectures upon
the constitution and upon our national history be
fore large audiences, of all political and religious
creeds, in the principal cities and towns of the State.
The fundamental truth that the permanence of our
institutions and the spread of American ideas,
through natural channels, depends upon the intellect,
the education and the integrity of individual citizens
and upon the extirpation of every form of political
tergiversation, has been enforced and illustrated, un
til the combined effect has almost attained the dignity
of a popular demonstration. The movement thus
definitely launched is rapidly spreading, until there
is a fair prospect that it will receive the support, as
it unquestionably has the approval, of the mass of
our citizens.
Various organizations, in which the tide of our
Western civilization is rising, are indicating their in
tention actively to participate in this great educa
tional work, through which the Grand Army of Amer
ican Citizens may insure the salvation of the country
and the fulfillment of its destiny.
The proceedings at Sacramento, therefore, in re
lation to the Senatorship. however dexterously con
cealed, will not escape the calcium light of popular
scrutiny, and the exposure and the fall of the Speaker
of the Assembly, his foolish surrender of oppor
tunities rarely within the reach of men of his youth
and of his limited experience, will serve to prove that
corruption, like murder, "will out," and that there can
be no future for a legislator who sacrifices his own
independence and his own honor.
In other States and countries men who have sold
their influence, when detected, are personally
shunned, or, in the English phrase, "sent to Cov
entry." This is the rule by which the United States
will have to be safeguarded. Our tolerance in mat
ters of religion and of politics, which, within its
proper constitutional sphere, cannot be too wide,
must be withdrawn when the print of bribery appears
on the forehead of mercenary representatives of
American constituencies.
MR, PERKINS AND THE CHRONICLE.
THE Chronicle of Monday last instructed the.
Legislature to instruct Senator Perkins not only
to vote for the treaty of Paris without amend
ment, but to swallow his own convictions, publicly
expressed and shared by the ablest statesmen in the
country, and vote also for the annexation of the
Philippines as a territory of the United States, and
for the admission of the Filipinos to full citizenship,
which the Chronicle has frequently declared is the
legal result of territorial acquisition in Asia under our
form of government.
The ground for the demand for this new instruc
tion is the assumption that Senator Perkins has con
ceded "that a State sends men to Congress as agents,
and not as principals." The expression is inaccurate,
because an ordinary agent is usually invested by his
principal with some discretion. This, however, is not
the Chronicle's interpretation of the views of Senator
Perkins in reference to instructions. The kind of
agency it means is the mere authority, automatically
exercised, and on national as well as State questions,
to record legislative decrees whenever they are pro
mulgated. Senator Perkins has a brain of his own.
He is well read in the history of his country. He has
had a wide legislative and executive experience. He
has associated at Washington with the greatest Amer
ican statesmen. How will he like the Chronicle's ac
ceptance of his letter to the Legislature as a com
plete surrender of his own individuality and of his
relations, on all national issues, to the entire popula
tion of the Union?
We cannot and do not believe that the humility and
self-abnegation of Senator Perkins are so extreme as
this extraordinary demand of the Chronicle would
seem to indicate, and we think that the views ex
pressed by The Call on the same day this demand was
made are an accurate exposition of the true situation.
That Howard E. Wright and his boon companions
in the Legislature should have the power, in con
junction with better men in the same body, to dic
tate to Senator Perkins how he shall vote on a ques
tion involving the terms of the Federal constitution,
our practice and our precedents in acquiring terri
tory on this continent and the rights and interests of
seventy-five millions of people, is too absurd for
serious consideration. Senator Perkins is a man of
intelligence, of,- knowledge and of character, and his
own manhood would not permit him to look his
fellow Senators in the face and acknowledge that on
national affairs he was governed by telephonic or
telegraphic communication with Sacramento.
Whether the treaty of Paris L or is not ratified
without amendment, we look for such a contest as the
world has rarely seen before men of the ancestry and
position of Senator Perkins break their constitutional
obligations and, against their own intellects, judg
ment and patriotism, vote to convert this nation into
an Americo-Asiatic republic, or into a colonizing
empire modeled after the type of Great Britain.
THE MERCHANT MARINE BILL.
SENATOR BOYCE has done well in submitting
to the Legislature a joint resolution urging
upon Congress the prompt passage of a bill for
the upbuilding of the American merchant marine. It
is full time to enact this legislation, so long needed
to do justice to our sailors and our ship-builders.
The very fact that we are to this day without any
adequate protection or governmental support for our
shipbuilding interests is itself proof of the far-reach
ing power of the forces that are opposed to such
legislation. We recently directed attention to a state
ment of ex-Senator Edmunds that while in active
politics he had fought for such legislation for twenty
five years, but had been always baffled by hostile in
fluences. The power of that opposition has not
weakened either in strength or in resolution. It is
as potent to-day as it has ever been, and it is there
fore important the friends of the measure should be
vigorous and persistent in, supporting it.
The life of. the present Congress is rapidly ebbing
away. The day when it will end its term will soon
arrive, and, there is much business before it. There
are grave issues of army reorganization, of Hawaiian
government, of the Nicaragua canal, to be discussed,
and the opponents of the American merchant marine
will take advantage of these to postpone consideration
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATUBDAY, JANUARY 28, 1899.
of the bill, if possible. They will : fight for delay if
they cannot hope to defeat the bill by any other
means, and it is against such tactics the friends of the
measure must guard. " : ''/y''r ' , . t .y x. \
One of the most effective means of. supporting the
bill under these circumstances is that of impressing
upon Congress the urgency of the measure and the
strength of public demand for it. That can be done
by the adoption of such resolutions as that intro
duced into the Legislature by Senator Boyce. When
Congressmen are made to understand by the declara
tions of Legislatures, Chambers of Commerce, and
all forms of organizations known to the country, that
the people demand the enactment of legislation that
will promote our shipbuilding industries, they will be
less easily induced by the opposition to postpone the
issue and leave it for the next Congress to deal with.
MURDER AUTHORIZED BY LAW.
THERE are few greater curiosities than the bills
which are introduced into legislative bodies
throughout the country for the correction of
what their authors deem to be public evils. These
bills are all framed upon the theory that it is possible
to regulate everything by law â a theory so utterly at
variance with human experience that its entertainment
by any sane person is marvelous. The common law oi
England was based on the customs of the people, and
it grew, thrived and developed with them. What the
people thought and did was sacred. All the courts
attempted in law cases was to discover the custom
which governed and interpret and give it force.
The American' idea of fixing the common law by
statute is exactly the opposite of that on which the
magnificent legal system of England has become the
wonder of the world. If an American legislator's
view of a theatrical performance be obstructed by a
woman's high hat, he immediately introduces a bill
making it a misdemeanor to wear hats in the play
house. If the cartoonist bother him, he at once
frames a law making it a felony : to ridicule a man; no
matter how ridiculous his acts may become. If a
newspaper prod him with printed words, he turns
his attention to the law of libel and attempts to
abridge the liberty of the press. If the carelessness
of trainmen cause a railroad accident he introduces a
bill requiring them to be more cautious. In fact,
there is nothing of a utilitarian character which he
will not attempt to do by law, never thinking that
after all unless statutes accord with the customs and
sentiments of the people they do not become a rule of
action, but a source of irritation.
The limit of legislative interference with the cus
toms and habits of the people, however, may be said
to have been reached when a bill is introduced t,o pro
mote murder. It would not seem to be possible to
conceive of any human ill for which homicide would
be a panacea; the law at present does not justify it
on any ground except self-defense, though juries
â¢sometimes acquit outraged husbands and fathers who
commit it on the ground of insanity. Yet a California
legislator entertains the idea that murder should be
justified when a person, deeming himself aggrieved,
kills a newspaper man. We venture to say there is no
instance in the annals of legislation in which personal
feelings have influenced the framing of a law similar
to this. Making murder the pastime of frauds and
politicians may be denominated the highest achieve
ment of the art of changing laws to suit the whims of
legislators..
This bill is not likely to receive much consideration
at the hands of the Judiciary Committees, many of
whose members. are. % still happily sane; but if it were
to pass, what would be the effect? Only brave and
reckless men would follow the profession of journal
ism. Timid journalists would write in secret, (leaving
their colleagues, clad in armor and loaded down with
knives and pistols,, to defend the craft from assault.
Under such a condition who would be killed in lar
gest numbersâ the frauds and politicians or the jour
nalists and artists? It should be easy to answer this
question. . The life of every man who even addressed
a journalist would be in danger. Newspaper offices
would become not places for collating and printing
news, but slaughter-houses, and legislators would be
slain in the halls of legislation by the wholesale. We
think the author of this measure after a short trial â
if his life were preserved would be the first to advo
cate its repeal.
Barbers will petition the Legislature for the enact
ment of a law requiring that no craftsman be allowed
to lather and cut without having undergone an ex
amination. The telegraphic mention does not specify
the character of the examination. Possibly it will be
in grammar and the principles of English construc
tion.
A reward of $30,000 has been offered for the con
viction of anybody voting illegally in Pennsylvania.
This is too much, for it is sufficient to tempt the pri
vate detective to "detect" the innocent, and a lot of
false swearing can be done for the amount.
Senator Ashe, who has in great measure depended
upon the press for the making of his fight, now seeks
to curtail newspaper freedom. This is about the style
of gratitude which caused Caesar to exclaim, "Et tv,
Brute!" r-y
There is no reason why Senator Morehouse should
dislike the papers. When he proclaimed himself as
one of "stainless heart" every paper in the State did
all it could to spread the information.

killing journalists should be required to see the

CALL READER OF SEVENTH WARD, OAKLAND. 3
CLOSING OF '
THE SCHOOLS
. To the Editor of The San Francisco
Call: One of the most important ques
tions has been placed before this com
munity .by the action of the present
Board of Education. A question which
not only concerns those who are di
rectly made to suffer by the decision of
this board, but it is a question which
in. its. consequences means the retro-
igressionâ almost the degradation of
one of the most enlightened and one of
the richest communities on the face of
the earth. . Â» 1'
This State has been well supplied
with funds and resources for educa
tional purposes. Enormous sums have
been at the disposal of men who by
the vote of their fellow citizens were
intrusted with the educational affairs
of' San Francisco. Those funds, which
would have been more than sufficient
to conduct our educational institutions,
have been squandered by the former
Board ! of Education and the present
board i_ facing a depleted treasury.
This is the situation at present.
Now the new board met and decided
to abolish one of the most useful in
stitutions in the city and Stateâ the
Normal School of San Francisco.
The closing of the evening schools,
discharge of a number of good teachers,
curtailing of other necessary expenses,
etc., shall follow. Here arises the
question, Is this the right course to
pursue?
The Normal School of San Francisco,
founded by one of the best educators
in the West, Mr. Swett, twenty-three
years ago, has educated several thou
sand teachers of whom almost any
community could be proud. At present
135 young ladies attend the Normal, and
of this number more than 100 expect to
pass their examination at the close of
the present term. Only four months
remain to complete their studies and
receive their diplomas; but here comes
the guardian of education and closes
the doors of that noble institutionâ
Normal School.
If this decision should prevail it
would deprive the city of one of her
best schools of learning of which she
should be proud; it would blight the
hopes of all . the candidates ' for the
honor to possess a well-deserved di
ploma, and it would disgrace the Board
of Education.
Only $4000 is needed to conduct the
Normal School to the close of the term
and 106 students of this institution will
present a petition to the Board of Edu
cation at the meeting to-night that they
are willing to provide the funds neces
sary to conduct the institution to the
close of the term.
Gentlemen of the Board of Education,
there is only one honorable course to
pursue. Reconsider and annul your
former resolutions and uphold that old
and noble institutionâ the Normal
School of San Francisco until such
time as the Legislature shall make
provision for the State of California to
conduct it at its own expense. This
city and our State should not be de
prived of this school of learning; whtch
has done its share to give to them the
name of one of the most enlightened
and one of the. brightest common
wealths on the face of the earth.

THE SCANDAL
_.;â¢Â» wÂ«.:;*iV^f-<:r.___l
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir:
The present state of affairs at Sacra
mento cries aloud for remedial legisla
tion. Legislators have shown them
selves unfit for public voting, as the
common herd of electors did long ago.
Let the Australian ballot system be ap
plied to Senatorial elections and the
scandal will cease. Colonel Mazuma's
occupation will be gone, as the uncer
tainty of the delivery of the goods will
be the most effective bar to the pay
ment of the price. It is sad to have to
say it, but one must deal with man as
he is and not as he ought to be. Make
the balloting for Senator secret and the
gordian knot is cut. Yours truly,
2-'ryy HENRY THOMPSON.

ridge." The thanks of this department to
E. O D., City, for furnishing this informa
tion.
COFFEE-T. 8., City. Whether coffee
should be boiled or not is a question that
has been agitated ever since coffee has
been used as a beverage, and it is as far
from definite solution as It was when first
mooted. How to make coffee is a matter of
taste, but those who claim to be judges
of coffee declare that the proper way is
to pour boiling hot water over the ground
coffee grains, ground just before using,
the strength to be determined by the
taste of the user. â¢ In this manner the
aroma of the fresh made, coffee is* pre
served, while in boiling it passes away.
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIAâ S., City.
The government of the District of Co
lumbia is vested by act of Congress, .ap
proved July 11, 1878, in three Commission
ers, two of whom are appointed _y the
President from citizens of the District
having had three years' residence there
in immediately preceding that appoint
ment and ; confirmed -by the -Senate. The
other Commissioner 'Is detailed by the
President of the United States from the
Corps of Engineers of the United States
army, and must have lineal rank senior
to captain or be a captain who hair served
at least fifteen years in the Corps of En
gineers of the army. The Commissioners
appoint the subordinate official service of
said government. - -

City. The following is given as the stamp
flirtation: Stamp inverted on right hand
upper corner means "write no more."
Stamp inverted on left hand upper corner
means a declaration of affection. Stamp
in the center at the top signifies an af
firmative answer to a question; oppo
site at the bottom means a negative.

fixed at a right angle asks the receiver
if he or she loves the sender: in the left
hand corner It Is a declaration of hate.

THE CENTURY-T. McG., Agnews,
Santa Clara County, and C. R., City. The
Christian era dates back to the beginning
of the first century,. and was fixed in 525.
The first century does not begin with the
birth of Christ. The date of the birth of
Jesus is now generally fixed a few yearsâ
at least before the commencement
of the Christian era in the accepted chro
nology. The' reasons for this are not
given, but the reckoning of dates from
the birth of Christ did not begin until
A. D. 525. The precise date of the birth
of Christ cannot be determined. The
century closes with the last second of 100
years; consequently the present century
will close at the last moment of the year
1900, and the very next moment, the first
of 1901, will be the first of the twentieth
century. â  â¢
NATIVITY AND , CITIZENSHIP âA.
M., City. This correspondent, in asking
the following question, confuses nativity
with citizenship: "My father came to this
country from Europe, was never natural
ized. I was born in San Francisco, am
now of age. Am I entitled to vote with
out having to obtain papers?" The son
of an alien resident of the United States
is a native of the United States and enti
tled to all the privileges, in which is in
cluded the right to vote, but such a
son on arriving at majority must elect
which , citizenship he will adopt, : that of
the country of his birth, or that of the
country of his father's birth. If on ar
riving at majority he performs any act
which his nativity entitles him to he
takes upon himself the citizenship of the
United States: but if he desires, he can
refrain from the performance of any such
act and olaim the citizenship of the coun
try of which his father is a native, and
in due form become a citizen of such
and doing so he is to all purposes an alien
and, although born in the United States'
would have, should he desire in the fu
ture to exercise the rights of an Ameri
can citizen, to be naturalized.
THE TENDERLOIN DISTRICT âN.
M., City. The term "Tenderloin District"
was one that was used by a police cap
.tain in New York City a number of years
ago when there was a change of captains
from one district to another. This par
ticular captain was one who had never
been able to get into the better districts
of the city. He felt disgusted that one of
his brother captains had been assigned
to one that he was anxious to get into
himself, and in. a tone of Disappointment,
while discussing the assignments that had
been made.said: "That fellow always gets
the tenderloin and I get the cheap cuts,"
meaning "that fellow" was always as
signed to the districts in which lived the
very best class of people and that he was
assigned to districts in which there was
only the riff raff of the community. Of
late years the term has been perverted
by persons who had no Idea of its origin
and meaning, and who have erroneously
used it. when speaking or writing of sec
tions that are occupied by disreputable
people. According to the intention of the
coiner of the phrase .that part of a city
in which there is the greatest amount of
wealth and the least- possible call for no
lice interference is the tenderloin diserict

CLAD IN SILK
Typical Chinese Case
Before Him.
RESPECTABILITY CALLED IN
PRESIDENT OF ONE OF THE SIX
COMPANIES CONTRADICTED.
Two Principal Witnesses Swear to a
Totally Different State of
Pacts and Are Dis
credited.
Another illustration of the recklessness
with which the Chinese commit perjury
in the Federal courts was exhibited yes-
terday in United Commissioner Heacock's
court. Yee Yut Hing, a boy of 10 or 11
years of age, and Yee Wat Hing, a young
man of 26 years, sought admission to this
country on the ground that they were
born in Elko, Nevada. v:
Hlng, the 10-year-old boy, swore before
the Chinese Bureau that he was 20 years
old, and that he went back to China
many years ago. An air of respectability
was imparted to the proceedings by the
introduction of a dignified looking Chi
nese, past middle age and wearing the
long silk skirts of the well to do mer
chant. He gave his name as Yee Foo
Yung, his occupation as merchant at
Elko, Nevada, and president of the Hop
Wah Company, one of the Chinese Six
Companies, he alleged. He claimed to be
the father of the boys, and said that he
and the mother went back with them to
China more than ten years ago, and that
he himself returned In IS9O. He had sworn
before the Chinese Bureau that he had
never had a portrait of himself taken
until the time he sat for his photograph
when he was making application in 1890
for a landing. Then he swore yesterday
before Commissioner Heacock that there
was a painting of his In his home In
China, and that it had been taken full
length. When asked why he had sworn
before the bureau that he never had a
picture taken before 1890, he replied that j
he had misunderstood the question put to
him in the bureau. His attention was
called to the fact that the 10-year-old
. boy, alias the 20-year-old, had testified
. that his father's portrait at home was
only half lengthâ from the head to the
, waist. This did not discompose Presl
. dent Yung In the least. He explained
that the portrait had probably been worn
; by the length of years and had been re
painted without the legs.
The. boys had testitfied that the other -
identifying witness, So Fat. had been a
frequent visitor to them at' their mother's
house In China. So Fat took the stand
i and testified that he was never in their
i house in his life.
Yee Wat Hlng, the older son, swore that
for five years prior to his arrival here
'be had been employed as a laborer in a
village several miles from the village in '
which h'ls : mother lived, and that during
that period he had not, lived at home.
The reputed father. President â¢ Yung,
swore that he received a letter by every
steamer from the mother of the boys,
saying that Hlng, the elder, had . not
worked for five years and was hanging
about the house idle.
1 Judge Heacock said that there could be
no doubt as to the contradictions in the
testimony, and that nothing remained for
him' to -do except to remand the peti
tioners. : . ' ....

A heavy weight to bear;
She stooped and murmured lovingly,

One had not known the burdened hands.
But knew the empty heart;
At life's rich banquet she had sat
An unfed guest, apart;
"Oh, not," she whispered tenderly,
- "An empty heart, dear child, for thee.*
And one was old; she had known care.
She had known loneliness;
She knew God leads us by no path
His presence cannot bless.

PERISH IN THE
VALDEZ GLACIER
five Meo Lose Their Lives and a
Number of Others Are Badly
Frostbitten.
'.SEATTLE, Jan. 27.â The steamship
Cottage City from Alaska brings news
that a number of Copper River pros
pectors lost their lives in Valdez Gla
cier, The following are known to have
perished:
' .HENRY KROHN, New York City.
'.â¢;â¢â¢Â£. SMITH. Chicago, 111.
2U> EMERSON. Baldwin, Wis.
iâ -.HENDERSON, Wisconsin.
â¢QEORGE SWEESEY, New York
City/..
Among the badly frozen miners are:
â¢'.Giyorge Poalowitz, New York City.
v 'Sylvester Crane, St. Joseph. Mo.
â¢;1 ; 4.-.Emerson, Baldwin Wis.
.â¢There are six men at Valdez suffer
lng'Vfjrom frozen feet, hands and faces.
Quits' a- hospital has been established
at ..Twelve-mile Camp, on the other side
of the glacier, and some fifteen men are
euffering there from the same cause.
AH' were frozen trying to cross the
glacier, but managed to get back into
camp.
.' -:T__.freezing : of the Emersons, father
"and' was particularly sad. They
started for Valdez, but on getting well
toward the summit of the glacier, found
their- feet freezing. Botn started back.
.The son gave his father some extra
Wrappings for his feet, and. as a re
sult, froze both legs in a few minutes,
and was unable to proceed. He bade
his father good-by and compelled him
to move on without him. Then the
boy lay down in the snow to die. His
body probably will never be recovered.
The. father reached Twelve-mile Camp
very badly frozen, and is not expected
to live. â¢
â Smith and Krohn were members of
the- â¢ same party, in company with
'.George Poalowitz, Sylvester Crane and
several others. They started across
the 'glacier early in December. Smith
.was the first to freeze his feet. After
fhe.y :had crossed the summit and were
moving down the long stretch toward
Valdez, his strength beget to fail. At
last 'he could keep up no longer. Call
ing .his companions around him, he
told them he was doomed, even if they
got, him into camp, and that they must
try and save themselves. Telling them
to. tell his wife and children back in
Chicago how he died, he lay down in
the snow, soon to be lulled into a last
sleep by deadly frost. He was a jew
eler by trade. i ; â â â  '.;â "" ::
: : .Henry Krohn wanted to He down
and die ..hen the trip was almost at an j
end. His comrades forced him to keep
moving in spite of the pain of his bad
ly frozen feet, and at last got him into
Valdez. His toes were so badly frozen
that they fell off when his boots were
cut away. Blood poisoning set in soon j
afterward, and in ten days the miners \
buried him in a rough grave. He was j
a member of the Manhattan Mining j
Company of New York, and leaves a
widow and a family somewhere in that <
great city. V '-
The- third man of this party to lose j
his life was a miner named Henderson,
from some small town in Wisconsin.
He started with the party, but was
frozen before they reached the sum
mit of the glacier. He decided his only
hope was to turn back. Soon after he
left the party a terrible blizzard swept
over the glacier, obliterating all trails
and making travel impossible. 'He
probably lost his way and perished.
At any rate he never reached Twelve
mile Camp, the only place of refuge
for miles around.
George Poalowitz of the Manhattan
Mining Company of New York was the
fourth member to be badly frozen. He
returned on the Cottage City to-day in
charge of Dr. Lewis of Chicago. He
will lose the greater part of both feet
and is in danger of losing his life from
blood poisoning He would not let Dr.
Lewis amputate his feet ln the north.
He said:
"It was bitter cold, and for four days
we wandered around the glacier, trying
to find our way down. We had little
food, as we were going out for sup
plies. The other four members of the
Manhattan Company were waiting on
short rations at the foot of the lake. I
do not know what will become of them
now that Krohn Is dead, and I am here
in almost as bad a fix. I don't want
my wife to know my condition, so I will
not tell you my New York address."
George Sweesey, also of New York,
was a blacksmith at Valdez for a long
time. He started across the glacier
early in the winter, drawing a heavy
sled. The details of his death are un
known, for he was alone. He never
reached the other side.
The miners who arrived on the Cot
tage City say that many others per
ished like Sweesey. They are unable
to give names. The men starting: out
in pairs or singly were never heard of
again. , ____________

Santa Rosa Student Forced by an
Irate Father to Become a

SANTA ROSA, Jan. 27.-Miss Lillian
Dillingham, a young lady well known in
this community, applied to the County
Clerk Tuesday afternoon for a marriage
license. She said the young man who
proposed to take her for his wife be
came timid, and that she had taken the
arranging of preliminaries into her own
hands. The person whose name she
claimed was to be linked with hers is
Charles A. Linebaugh, a student at the
Santa Rosa Business College, and a. resi
dent of this county. She was given the
paper and proceeded to the Magnolia
Hotel. From there she caused a mes
sage to be dispatched to young Linebaugh
at the college, stating that his father
was at the hotel and desired to see him
When the young man, who was all
conjecture as to what his parent wanted,
arrived at the hotel he was confronted
by a minister and an irate papa. in whose
possession was an ugly looking- pistol to
back up a stern request that Linebaugh
marry Miss Dillingham. _he surround
ings suggested no other course and the
student allowed the ceremony to take
place. Â»
To-day in the Superior Court a suit* was
brought to annul the marriage on the
ground that it was induced by threat and
was illegal.

GOLD FINDS ON
COPPER RIVER
Returning Party Reports
Discoveries.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, Jan. To-day's ar
rivals from Copper River are the first
to come since last fall. Some of them
had been three months at Valdes wait
ing for a steamer. The last party
from the interior left Copper Center on
December 1. They are A. P. Wedum of
Glasgow, Mont.; John Eckland, Hay
nan, Wis.; J. R. Marshall, Mexico, Mo.,
and Nels Hyland, Appleton, Wis. They
penetrated the interior as far as
Catcham Stockades, a branch of the
Forty Mile River. They crossed the
Tananu Valley, but heard of no gold
strikes. They have been traveling
toward the coast since August 1.
Dr. W. L. Lewis of Chicago says
there is considerable scurvy in the in-
terior. Thomas Hunt of Detroit, Mich.,
has been ill with the disease at Valdes.
Dr. Lewis established a hospital On
the other side of Valdes glacier. It
has a number of patients. A number of
men who were frozen have had their
limbs amputated. There are several
destitute men at Valdes who have no
means of returning to the United
States.
C. truce, formerly of Tacoma, said:
"After getting into the interior we
found there were some sixty Masons
in the country, and we at once decided
to form an association for mutual ben
efit. I was elected president; B. G.
Levroos of St.. Paul vice-president;
Herbert Smith of New York treasurer,
and H. E. Pierson of Denver traveling
manager.
"One of the members of the associa
tion made a discovery late in October
that will startle the world. He stumbled
across a small creek in his wanderings.
The indications were unfavorable, but
he began to prospect. Inside of a week
he took out over $200 in gold. He came
at once to the Masonic headquarters at
Copper Center and told the members
of the find. In small parties enough
Masons went in to stake a claim for
every member. *â¢ ;1 : v;
"Talkill Creek Is a tributary of the
Tonsina River. Over seventy-five men
are working on the creek claims, and
all are taking out gold. Manker Creek,
also; running into the Tonsina, has
proved the bonanza of the district. On
claim 52, above Discovery, which is the
most developed, 75 cents to the pan is
being taken out. There are sixty-five
men on the creek. About 200 men have
claims in the vicinity of Mount Drum.
They are located on a small cr_ek and
are taking out from 15 to 25 cents to the
pan, although they have not yet
reached bedrock.' A new discovery is
Quartz Creek, a branch of the Tonsina,
on which 100 men are working. _ X '. ;
"The Masons have been very lucky
in the Copper River country. None
have been frozen and but one has died.
j We are united very strongly and the
i Masonic Creek Is sure to pay big
j money."
Reports from Juneau say that a new
j lake has been discovered a short dis
i tance in the interior from Lynn Canal.
It has been named Walker Lake, after
Its discoverer, G. W." Walker. The
: creeks emptying into It are said to
! contain much gold. On one small creek
! named Bonanza, Walker, it is stated,
got an average of 51 to the pan.

GOLF VS. SAUSAGE
IS NOW IN COURT
Chris Kjeio's Slaughter - House
Offends San Rafael's Esthetic
Knigbts of the Link;.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 27.â G01f versus Sausage was not exactly the
title of a suit filed In the Superior Court to-day, but it really amounts
to that. The San Rafael Golf Club, through Henry C. Campbell, has
attacked Chris Klein, a wealthy butcher, in the courts on the ground
that he is maintaining a nuisance. As Klein is determined to pre
serve what he believes to be his rights, a legal struggle of unusual in
terest is about to be Inaugurated. A few months ago the San Rafael
Golf Club was incorporated, and leased the Wagner tract for links. It
is situated about two miles north of town. Extensive improvements
have been begun, and the intention is to make the links the finest In the
State. Just above the golf grounds is situated the Kimball tract,
owned by Klein, a wealthy man, with an iron will. Klein maintains a
number of head of cattle on this tract, and his slaughter house is also
there. The aroma from this slaughter house is in no wise akin to
those of Araby the blest, and frequent attempts on the part of Carter
P. Pomeroy and Campbell to have Klein move the odor manufactory
resulting in naught, the courts have been petitioned for relief. It is al
leged in the complaint that the water of a stream flowing through
Klein's property and the golf grounds is contaminated by refuse and
offal so strongly as to be a nuisance. Campbell asks for $10,000 dam
ages and an Injunction. The petition is fortified by the affidavits of
such notables as United States Judge W. W. Morrow, Frank S. John
son of the Johnson-Locke Company, Carter P. Pomeroy, E. G. Stet
son and Dr. H. O. Howitt. Klein says he "was there first," and that
his slaughter house is the cleanest in the State. He has determined
to fight the case to the bitter end. Upon the depositing of a $1000 bond
by Campbell, Judge Angellotti has issued a restraining order asking
Klein to appear and show cause why a temporary injunction should not
be issued. .'

SPORTS AFIELD, AFLOAT AND ASHORE
TROUT AND STRIPED BASS.
Fishing in the Tide Waters of Paper-
Mill â Spooning for
Striped Bass.
The past week of exceedingly dry
weather has had a scorching effect on the
coast streams, which were running bank
high two weeks ago. The Papermill
I Creek has already a midsummer appear
ance, and the steelheads which ascended
the stream at the time of the flood are
. now either landlocked in the deep pools
or captured by the handlers of the pitch
fork, whose only enjoyment Is seemingly
spearing breeding fishes. Yesterday in
formation was received from Nicasio that
seven large steelheds were taken from
â¢ one pool by a spearsman. Everything is
reported quiet on the Papermill, although
last Saturday three fish were speared in
the Lagunitas.
Lnst Saturday and Sunday a large dele
gation of midwinter anglers visited Point
Reyes, but they missed the first run and
returned home with empty baskets.
On Sunday morning Charley Breiden
stein ("Pinky") hooked a twelve "pound
er" at the rock hole, but through over
excitement and poor Judgment on the part
of the angler the fish got away with sev
eral yards of line. Charley Preeht, who
was an interested observer, was lecturing
' th( much disgusted angler on how to hold
a rod during critical moments, when he
was alarmed by the sudden click of a reel,
and, grasping his pole, he soon had
troubles of his own.
The reel sang out merrily, and "Pinky"
was wishing that the fish on the end of
. Preeht 's line would also find Its way
clear -of restraint, so that he could turn
the tables on the veteran stream whipper.
But Preeht was not to be fooled by the
mad rushes of a game fish, and after lit
teen or twenty minutes of fine sport he
landed his prize, and then discovered that
one of the books attached to his line had
accidentally caught in a loop of the leader
Which Breidenstein had lost, with the re
sult that he (Preeht) had killed, so to
speak, two birds with the one stone.
Among the anglers who caught more
water than fish were "Doc" Cox, O.
P. Evans, Frank Hall, Del Cooper, Frank
Vernon. John Slebe, John Schroeder,
"Handy Andy," Charles Linn, Louis
Javett; F. Dolliver, John Benn, J. Gal
lagher ar.d the only "June Bug" Walker.
"Doc" Watt fished on Saturday and land
ed a limb of a tree very successfully.
Walker also stuck fast in a branch on
Sunday and Frank Dolliver. by clever
marksmanship shot the limb from the tree
â¢and saved -Mr. Walker his imported Eng
lish leader. Messrs. Cooper and Jackson
landed some very large bullheads on Sat
urday night at the rock pool. A large
fish was hooked yesterday by Mr. Jack
son nt the White House.
Al dimming. M. Sachs and Eli Marks
have been fishing and shooting since Mon
day last on Salmon Creek. Cumming
shipped a ten-pound striped bass yester
day to Henry Skinner of _. T. Allen &
Co., and a letter which read that on Wed
nesday while trolling 'for steelheads he ac
. cldentally happened to cast into a deep
pool, which was literally alive with strip
ed bass. For an hour the sport was im
mense, but when the tide fell the, fish quit
feeding. Cumming landed nine bass, the
total weight of which was thirty-three
pounds, besides one ten-pounder, which,
as previously stated, he shipped to tills
city In good condition.
The successful angler used a small Wil
son inner with copper coloring on both
sides. The striped bass are now running
Into the lagoons for the. purpose of
spawning.
Morgan of Duncan's Mills caught a
thirty-pound striped bass in a seven and
a half inch mesh net last Monday in
Russian River, which stream* is yet too
high for trolling or bait fishing.
The annual meeting and election of offi
cers of the Fly Casting Club will be held
in the Mills building on Tuesday, Febru
ary 7. when arrangements will be perfect
ed for the coming season's fly casting
contests.

Fred Foster's crack five-year-old
horse. Dr. Sheppard, took time by the
fetlock and made it look like a selling
. plater at Oakland track yesterday. In
the mile and a sixteenth selling event the
big son of Buchanan, with 114 pounds on
his back, won all the way In runaway
fashion, covering the distance in I:4s'_, a
new coast record. He closed favorite in
the betting, and was followed in byDunois
and Satsuma. The performance far ex
ceeds in point of merit that of Redskin,
â¢â¢ holder of the American record of 1:4.V .
made at Forsythe track on June 6, 18%,
as that horse carried but 86 pounds. Yes
terday's winner * was piloted by Cash
Sloan.
The weather and track were admirable
for racing purposes, and another large
crowd was in attendance. The favorites
continue to fall, as but two were able to
shake their fields off.
There was no beating Strongoll in the
opening sprint over the Futurity course.
Entered to be sold for $300, the big bay
.colt was a 1 to 2 chance, and won hands
â¢ down from Whaleback. Campus was
third, in front of The. Fretter, second
choice. .:â  < i -:- -:
Barney Schreiber's mud-runner, Jerry
Hunt, was installed a lukewarm favorite
for the six furlong sprint that followed,
but could not hold out. After being badly
interfered with on the backstretch, H.
Martin astride Sir Urian ran around his
â¢ field, and in a hard drive led Jennie Reld
out a nose. Genua finished third.
A change in riders worked wonders with
Frank Jaubert. Spencer rode The Bard
gelding in the mile selling run, and the
checks went down straight.
Strolling along leisurely in third place
until well into the stretch, Spencer then
â¢made his move, winning cleverly from
Judge Wofford. The, latter was undoubt
edyl best, but Johnny Re iff was tardy in
cutting loose. Master Lee, the favorite,
was outfooted from the start.
The original fourth race was declared
off, and a six furlong selling affair sub*
stituted. Meadow Lark again had first
call In the betting, and once more proved
a disappointment. Shasta Water, ridden
.by Thorpe, and 16 to 5 in the betting,
easily disposed of his company. Magnus
in a drive took the place from the
â¢ favorite.
Tom Ryan's fast mare. Don't Skip Me,
Was the pick of the talent to win the
seven furlong dash that concluded the
. racing, ami though she made a bold bid
for it, failed to land. Peixotto, the chest
nut horse, with Spencer up, overhauled
Mldlight in the run through the stretch,
leading the first choice out a couple of
lengths in 1:26*..
Track Notes.
The racing firm of Farrar & Tubervllle yes
terday dissolved partnership.
The record for one mile and a sixteenth Is at
the mercy of Dr. Sheppard any time Fred
Foster cares to send his horse after it. Owners,
however, care little for records.
Jimmy Coffey, it Is said, told his friends to
| warden of Mendocino County, writes from
j Point Arena to the sporting editor that
I di_Â«Â»!K the present season the net fisher
i men of Point Arena have not shipped
j more than three boxes of steelheads to
j this city and that the fishes were caught
j in tide waters by nets that were of law
â¢ ful dimensions. He further states that
' the game and fish laws are being observed
i and that he is keeping a close watch on
; all suspicious characters. The Call Is
i pleased to learn that the Rod and Gun
: Club of Point Arena has such a competent
; and faithful officer looking out for tho
interests of game and fish.
! LADY TENNIS PLAYERS.
Warm Weather Brings Them Out on
the California Courts Some
Good Matches.
The summer-like weather of the. past
week has brought many ladies out upon
the courts of the California Lawn Tennis
Club, especially in the forenoon. Among
the ladies who have been practicing dur
ing the past week were Miss Eisen, Miss
Lacy, Miss Elsie Clark, Miss Ruth
Foster, Miss Bessie Bowman, Miss E.
Hunter, Miss E. Chesebrough, Miss Mabel
Bacon, Miss C. Eekart, Miss Opal Pierce,
Miss Ada Clark, Miss Maud Bourn and
Miss Aronson. Miss Hunter and Miss
Eisen played together against the pro
fessor, and though they were beaten
they put up a strong game. It is prob
able that they will, constitute a team.
Though it is now some time since W. S.
McGavln was champion, he still plays a
keen game and holds his own against the
younger players, having beaten Arthur
Chesebrough, Harvey Walter and Buchly.
Ralph Bliven has been playing, and,
though he was entirely out of practice,
is rapidly regaining his old form. The
Whitney brothers came together twice
during the week. At the last meeting R.
N. Whitney defeated George F. Whitney
In three straight heats, but on the second
occasion George turned the tables and won
two out of three sets from Robert. Dr.
Root and George Bradshaw have played
against each other, with honors about
even. Mr. Blanchard, secretary of the
club, came out to the courts some days
ago and announced his intention of taking
up the game, again shortly.
On Wednesday, February 1, there will
be a ladies' tournament, doubles, for
which a good list of entries is expected.
To-day and to-morrow many players will
be out on the courts, though no special
event has been arranged.
Whitman, the champion of the United
States in singles, and Ware and Sheldon,
the champions of the United States in
doubles, are anxious to come out to Cali
fornia this year, and will do so If satis
factory arrangements can be made. As
the Eastern players are accustomed to
play on grass. It will take them a little
time to become used to asphalt courts,
but, as soon as they are In good form,
Callfornians will have a chance to
measure the local game with that of ac
knowledged masters. This is an oppor
tunity Californians have never had in
their own State, and only to a limited ex
tent outside of it.

HE ESCAPED CONVICTION.
Officer Kenville Must Again Stand
Trial for Assaulting Willie
Lynch..
The jury impaneled to try Officer Frank
L. Kenville on a charge of assault with
a deadly weapon disagreed and was dis
charged yesterday at noon by Judge Cook.
Up to the last nine of the jurors de
cided that the accused officer should be
convicted of a charge of simple assault,
but three decided that he should be ac
quitted. Little Willie Lynch, who suffered
from a blow from the officer's club, will
n consequence be forced to again undergo
the ordeal of testifying when the case is
called for a second trial.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 28, â¢-â  1 899.
DON'T WANT TIN MEDALS.
Oarsmen Dissatisfied With the Prizes
Awarded by the Pacific As
sociation.
For some time past there has been grow
ing among the amateur athletes, and es
pecially among the rowing men, of San
Francisco, a feeling of dissatisfaction
with the medals awarded as prizes at all
events held under the management of
the Pacific Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union. The oarsmen say that
the practice of awarding medals as the
only prizes inures to the benefit of one
jeweler, who is a member of the board of
managers, and does not conduce to the
best interests of the sport. At the last
regatta of the Pacific Association held at
Long Bridge on November 6, 1&98, sev
eral of the competitors protested against
the award of medals. Dr. C. C. Dennis of
the South End Rowing Club, and formerly
outrigger skiff champion, suggested that
the winners should be allowed to choose
their prizes.
One of the board of managers of the Pa
cific Association took offense at this sug
gestion, and at a meeting of the board ex
pressed a desire that the doughty sculler
should be disciplined. No action, how
ever, was taken in the matter.
In a recent interview Dr. C. C. Dennis
said: "The rowing men are greatly In
terested in this question. They are put to
considerable expense for boats, oars, row
ing costumes and other necessary articles.
They go into training, practice regularly
and then sweat and row their hearts out to
provide a show for the spectators, and
what do they get in return? They get
what are commonly known as 'tin med
als,' which are never worn, except by
very young athletes, but are shoved away
Into a drawer or a cupboard. Of course,
the rules of the Amateur Athletic Union
do not permit athletes who wish to retain
their amateur standing to receive money
or clothing as prizes, but they may accept
silverware or articles of jewelry; in fact,
anything which can be engraved, and that
does not wear out. I do not see why the
board of managers should not give prize
winners orders upon a dealer in athletic
goods. Fred Ayers of the Alameda Boat
Club, who won the outrigger skiff cham
pionship at the last Long Bridge regatta,
feels just as I do about the matter, and
so, I am sure, do several others. I have
no doubt that I shall make myself unpop
ular in certain quarters by this expression
of opinion, but the matter should be ven
tilated, and some one must open his
mouth first. The feeling of dissatisfac
tion is by no means confined to myself,
but Is quite general among the rowing
men."
S. J. Pembroke, a well known oarsman
and a member of the board of managers
of the Pacific Association, on being asked
his opinion about medals as prizes for
rowing events, expressed himself thus;
"Medals are all right for championship
events, but at other regattas prizes of a
different character should be given. The
object of awarding medals is to do away
with the mercenary element, and to
award something which cannot be worn
out, but must be kept as a memento of
the victory. The rules of the Amateur
Athletic Union say that 'no prizes shall
be accepted by any athlete except suit
ably inscribed wreaths, diplomas, ban
ners, badges, medals, time-pieces and
mantel ornaments, or articles of Jewelry,
silverware, table or toilet service.' To
kens composed wholly or partly of metal
and bearing inscriptions may be awarded.
No prize should be given which can he
converted into money. Anything which
fairly admits of being engraved Is proper,
but it would be an evasion to affix an en
graved metal plate or shield to a sack of
flour or a case of bottled beer and award
it as a prize.
"Amateurs may not row for suits of
clothes, tons of coal or sides of bacon.
Men who want prizes of this sort are pro
fessionals in spirit and should become pro
fessionals in fact. They should make
matches with each other, put up their
money and get it covered. The amateur
is a man who engages in a sport for the

dentally he likes to beat others and to
win mementos of his victory, but he does
not regard his skill as a means of making
or eking out a livelihood. The man who
is eager to barter his skill in an athletic
exercise or game for money or useful per
ishable articles is a professional, and
should not pose as an amateur. The
spirit of the amateur is not in him."
Now that "Bob" McArthur has been
chosen as one of the board of managers
of the Pacific Association some lively and
exciting meetings of that body may be
expected, and among the questions that
will arouse discussion, this very one of
medal-giving is sure to take an important

WITH OAR AND SHELL.
Rawing Clubs Are Arranging Events
to Make the Summer Season
Interesting.
The float of the South End Rowing Club
was so seriously damaged by the recent
storm- that most of last Sunday was spent
In putting it into partial repair, so that,
favorable as the day was for rowing, it
was not possible for any of the members
to go out on the water until quite late.
There was a large attendance at the boat
house, and considerable work was done
on the handball court, which Is expected
.to be ready for use about the first of
March. V^i;;
At the meeting on Tuesday night it was
decided to row over in the Whitehall to
Alameda at some early date, probably to
morrow, and bring back to this side of
the bay the barge Felton, which has been
put into thorough repair by Al Rogers.
Robert McArthur was elected to serve on
the board of managers of the Pacific As
sociation of the Amateur Athletic Union
and consented to act; so that lively times
may be expected at the meetings of the
association. The South End oarsmen
think that too many regattas were held
last year, and that three good eventsâ
that is, two at El Campo and one on the
4th of July, in addition to the regattas of
the various clubsâ are enough. The South
End oarsmen are anxious to send a crew
up to the Astoria regatta this year, and
for that reason wish the club to get a
new barge. - T. I. Fitzpatrick, E. Scully
and J. ODea were appointed a committee
to devise means for raising enough money
to cover the cost of having a new barge
built. The club proposes to hold its an
nual banquet in a short time. The regu
lar annual picnic will be given, and T. I.
Fitzpatrick, E. Scully and J. Foley have
been appointed a committee to select the
grounds and make arrangements for the
outing.
The handsomest and most commodious
boating quarters on the bay are those of
the Dolphin Club, which on fine Sundays
are crowded with members. Last Sun
day all the boats were out, some going
to Fort Point and others to the Japanese
steamer Nippon Maru. A. W. Pape, W.
O. Patch and T. R. Keonan went out in
skiffs. The Dolphins have decided to de
fer their Ladles day until the summer.
They intend to give a thoroughly good
entertainment, with as many novel and
diverting aquatic features as they can de
vise or discover. Captain Pape has sent
out communications, requesting likely
candidates for places in the crews to come
down to the boathouse for practice. It
has been settled that George Baker win
take Victor Cagllerl's place in the inter
mediate barge crew. At the last Ladies'
day given by the Dolphins one of the most
interesting events was the barge race be
tween the Irish and German crews. This
year an Italian crew will be added. Much
interest is felt among the members as to
the result of the race. â

In the Divorce Courts.
Ella Hartnup was granted a divorce
from William A. Hartnup yesterday on
the grounds of willful neglect and failure
to provide. The plaintiff was allowed to
resume her maiden name, Ella Howell.
Mattie Shepherd has sued Charles Shep
herd for a divorce, alleging cruelty as a I
cause of action.
THE YACHTING SEASON.
The California Yacht Club First to
Announce Its Official Programme
for the Year.
The first sailing race of the season of
1599 will take place to-morrow, January
29, on Oakland Creek, starting at 1 p. m.
from .point near Sessions Basin. This
race, which will be over* a seven-mile
course, was deferred from January 15,
when the weather was unfavorable. The
committee in charge of the Oakland Navy
consists of Vice Commodore H. C. Hinck
ley of the Oakland Canoe Club., Charles
Stewart, Jules Hartman and Charles L.
Taylor Jr. There will be a race each
month during the season, that of Febru
ary being set for the 12th. *
The election of officers of the San Fran
cisco Yacht Club f0r. 1899 will take place
on Wednesday evening, February 8, when*
it is expected that the regular ticket will
bo carried. There is some talk of an op
position ticket, but it is by no means cer
tain that one will be prepared. Dr. A. W.
McKenzie, the port captain of last sea
son, has parted with' the launch Alberta
and become owner of the 'handsome sloop
Sappho, which last season carried the flag
of Vice Commodore George B. Edgar of
the Californias, and which in 1897 was
owned by Herbert E. Law, commodore of
the Pacific Yacht Club.
At the annual meeting of the Corinthian
Yacht Club the regular ticket was elected
unanimously. The commodore's report
for the season of 1898 was full and inter
esting, a reference to men who received
the benefits of the club without contrib
uting to its support being particularly
well received. The Corinthians now have
accommodation for small boats for some
time to come, but the number of lockers
is insufficient, and will be Increased as
funds permit. It Is possible that tho
Night in Venice, which was so success
fully given in the cove some years ago,
may be repeated during 1899.
At the annual meeting of the Oakland
Canoe Club there was a large attendance
of members. The club is in a flourishing
condition, having received many more
applications for membership than it could
accept. The following officers were chosen
for the season of 1899: Philip Caduc, com
modore; H. C. Hinckley, vice commodore;
Charles Stewart, secretary and treasurer;
Clyde D. Carman and Dr. S. H. Hackett,
committee on applications for member
ship.
The California Yacht Club is manifest
ing renewed activity. At its last meeting
eleven new members were elected, and
several more applications for membership
are in the hands of members. Ex-Com
modore E. A. yon Schmidt, one of the
founders of the club, was placed on the
honorary list, in recognition of his many
services to the club. It is not unlikely
that the office of admiral will be abol
ished. The Californias are the first to
have their programme of events for the
coming season ready. It is as follows:

GOLF IS BOOMING.
An Outdoor Pastime Which Will At-
tract Large Gatherings This
Season.
The popularity of golf and the number
of links are constantly growing. For ex
ample, in Riverside, besides several priv
ate links, there are two golf clubsâ the
Riverside Polo and Golf Club, of which
M. E. Flowers Is secretary, and the Pa
chappa Golf Club, of which Perrln B.
White is secretary. The, Pachappa Golf
Club was organized in November last and
already has seventy-eight members. It
has a nine-hole course, the distances be
ing 285, 450, 270, 255, 275, 200, 300, 205 and 210
yards; total, 2480 yards. The club has no
home as yet, and therefore will not hold
any open tournaments this season; btft
a programme containing fifteen events
has been prepared for membersâ ten of
these events being for gentlemen j and five
for ladies. The first of a series of five
tournaments for gentlemen- against Col
onel Bogey was held on January 28, and
others will, be held on February 22, March
23, April 20 and May 18. Tournaments in
medal play for gentlemen will be held on
February 9, March 9, April 6 and May 4.
Those who take first or second place In
these contests will be entitled to compete
in the tenth tournament, match play, on
May 30, for a silver cup.
Tournaments, medal play, for the ladies
of the Pachappa Golf Club, will be held
on February 2, March 2, March 30 and
April 27. The fifth tournament will be at
match play and will take place on May 25.
In Southern California golf enjoys a
greater vogue and attracts even more in
terest than in Central California. The
clubs at Riverside have already been men
tioned. There is also a flourishing club
at Santa Catalina. The links of the Santa
Catalina Island Golf Club are among the
most beautiful and picturesque in the
country. They are situated behind Ava
lon ln a great amphitheater of hills, from
the tops of which many canyons, like
streams of verdure, run down to the
course. The club house stands on a lit
tle mesa overlooking the links, and near
it is the first teeing ground. The distance
to the first green is 210 yards. The green
is named Santa Cruz, and is on the fur
ther side of a canyon beneath the hills.
The bogey score is four. The second hole,
San Miguel, is 178 yards away, and is
protected by a high wire bunker that runs
across the whole width of the course. The
bogey score is three. The third teeing
ground Is in the entrance to a little can
yon filled with trees, which winds away
up to the summit of the ridge. The drive
is up the steep face of a cliff, which is
forty feet high, and constitutes the most
difficult bunker on the course. Having
negotiated the cliff, the player climbs up
the canyon and finds himself on a mesa
on the south side of Grand Canyonâ a
beautiful, well-grassed spot, surrounded
on every side by green hills and gulches.
To the eastward the blue waters of the
bay of Avalon are visible. The distance
to this hole, San Nicholas, Is 238 yards,
and the bogey score is four. The fourth
hole, Santa Catalina, is 280 yards away,
and, if the player succeeds In making a
good drive across a deep ravine, should
be . done in four strokes. , He is now on
the top of a little mesa surrounded by
hills. Descending, he crosses a canyon
by a rustic bridge and drives his ball
down the sloping little mesa to San Clem
ente, tho bogey score being three. The
sixth teeing ground â  stands on the edge
of the mesa, high above the main can
yon. Two hundred and thirty yards dis
tant is the sixth hole, Anacapa, with a
"wash" Intervening as a hazard. The
bogey score is four. The seventh green,
Santa Rosa, though only a hundred yards
away, is not visible, for between It and
the player is a high bunker. But if the
ball Is well played it will land on the
green directly. behind the club house and
be holed in three strokes. . Thence the
course goes up a mesa skirting a deep
canyon. The distance to Santa Barbara,
the eighth hole, being 230 yards and the
bogey score four. The view from these
greens is delightful, the course following
the level canyon and mesa, and yet being
surrounded by mountains. \
After leaving Santa Barbara the player
walks over a little divide, crosses a can
yon by a bridge, and finds the ninth
teeing-ground on a small mesa facing the
clubhouse; the , distance to Guadalupe,
the home green, is 185 yards, and many
players have driven the ball right on to
it. It is but a few yards from the well
equipped clubhouse, which is surrounded
by a wide piazza and a pretty , garden.
The total distance of the course Is 1818
yards, and the total bogey. score Is" 32;
the record score Is 35 (being four each for
the first eight holes, and three for the last
one), and was made by Franc O. Wood
of Colorado Springs, Colo. '

WILD DUCKS INNUMERABLE.
Richardson Bay Is Now the Favor
ite Lounging Place for Canvas
back and Bluebiils.
The game shooting season' Is fast draw
ing to a close, still sportsmen have been
enjoying good duck shooting at differ
ent points along the Sacramento River
recently. The best sport is now in the
possession of hunters who reside in the
vicinity of Colusa. In the tules which
are within easy reach of the sports
men of Colusa wild ducks are exceedingly
plentiful, and records of 100 birds to a
gun have been madÂ© in the past few
weeks.
John Kerrigan and Mr. Dormer had a
very successful quail shoot last Thursaay
In the hills east of Hamlet Station,
which is on the line of the North Pacific
Railroad.
Thomas Walsh, Dr. Robinson, Dr. Mur
phy and Archie McDonald enjoyed some
flrst-class duck and snipe shooting last
week near Byron. They Intend paying the
hunting grounds a second visit in a few
days. ";?.'.'
Countless thousands of canvasback and
blueblll ducks are now 'camped" on the
placid waters of Richardson Bay, and it
Is said that some of the enterprising net
fishermen have been devoting their at
tention to the capture of the birds, which
sell for far better prices than bay fishes
command.
Tom Irvine of Point Reyes bagged
three dozen canvasback on Wednes
day last on a lagoon which empties into
Tomales Bay.
Tom Casey, "the old man of the moun
tains," whose headquarters aro on the
water front, has purchased a cunning
little French poodle-dog from a lady
friend. The old man is still fond of chas
ing game when it is easily bagged. He
contends that he can train the poodle
for the kind of hunting he desires most,
which must, however, he softer exercise
than that of hill-climbing. For a man of
his yearsâ sixty-fiveâ is an ex
tremely vigorous old chap, and his friends
say that he can tramp as many miles af
ter game to-day as he was capable of
tramping forty years ago. Casey is a
stanch member of the Veteran Firemen's
Association, and several years ago he was
considered a very good amateur quail
shooter.

Twenty-Five Mile Cycle Event to Be
Held in March.
The board of governors of the California
Associated Cycling Clubs will probably
change the date of this year's annual
twenty-five-mile road race at their next
meeting. This classic event has been
held on Washington's birthday, February
22, for years past. This year, however,
the club riders are all in active training
for short-distance races at San Jose and
the coming tournament here, and none of
them will be In shape for a twenty-five
mile road grind. It was therefore
thought best to put the race over a month
and it will be held the latter part of
March.
"Jimmy" Michael has started training
at the Olympic Club. He is doing no rid
ing, but works four hours a day as hard
as any pugilist, with weights, dumb bells
and similar devices. . His wheeling will
be done in thejpark.
Eddie Bald started light training yes
terday, and will soon be ln good shape.
Bald only intends to ride in exhibitions
here. He will not race .until he gets to
France in April.
The Olympic Club Wheelmen are plan
ning a banquet to Michael and Bald, to
be held in the near future. The Garden
City Wheelmen of San Jose and the Bay
City Wheelmen of this city are also ar
ranging some functions in their honor.
Bald will be the guest of honor at the
Bay City's fourteenth anniversary ball
to be held at the Palace Hotel on Wednes
day evening, February 8. This affair is
for members and their friends, and invi
tations may be had from any of the mem
bers.
The races of the Garden City Wheel
men at San Jose to-morrow will draw a
large crowd from this city, who will go
down on the 9 and 10:40 a. m. trains.
Most of the Eastern riders now here will
be there.

BANNER COURSING EVENT.
Ninety Fleet Greyhounds â¢ Will Scat
ter Grass at Ingleside
Park To-Day.
With a continuation of the present
warm and pleasant weather there should
be the grandest sport Imaginable* to-day
and to-morrow at the Ingleside Coursing
Park. r2'y! ': r
True, the stake is much larger than tha
managers of the park had anticipated,
but the requests for a place on the pro
gramme for this dog and that dog were
so numerous that Count yon Halpin was
unable to muster up sufficient courage to
call a halt on dogs that were entered lata
by owners who had been stanch support
ers of Ingleslde Park since its inaugura
tion.
Ninety-one dogs is assuredly a very
large number, and when it is considered
that to balance accounts properly forty
five courses must be run off to-day, then
it will be seen at a glance that very little
delay must occur between the slipping of
pairs, otherwise the finals will be run
under cover of darkness.
But, then, the Troja,ns of Ingleside Park
have had such a lengthy experience in
matters coursing that they can figure to
the minute when the last brace of dogs
will enter the slips.
The fact that seventy-two all-age doga
will be handled by Slipper Jim Grace in
the run down and then nineteen saplings
of high degree to follow, is in itself suf
ficient evidence to prove to the most ar
dent admirer of the sport that the peopla
who own good dogs are desirous that thelij
charges must run at Ingleside Park.
There Is an old saying that "a new
broom sweeps clean," but the adage does
not apply to Ingleslde, for the simple
reason that ever since John Grace haa
been in the saddle the Ingleslde Park haa
made a clean sweep of everything that
opposed it from a coursing standpoint,
and doubtless it will enjoy prosperity for
many moons.
The gatherings of true sport lovers at
Ingleside Park on coursing days have;
been noticeably increasing during the past
few months purely because the sport Is
clean in every respect, and the park la
within easy access of leashmen who re
side In the city. , _â  ", : -_
Seven thousand people witnessed last
Sunday what certainly proved to be tha
grandest and most interesting coursing
the sportsmen of San Francisco have ever
had the pleasure of seeing in an Inclosed
park. The hares were on their mettla
and, indeed, the dogs were also in condi
tion to travel long distances.
Especial preparations have been mada
to receive a large crowd to-day, which
should be the banner day in the history
of coursing in this State. The points
made by the contesting dogs in each
course will figure on the big blackboard
Immediately after the flag goes up. This
is an innovation which has been wel
comed by many visitors who have quick
ly recognized the fact that Ingleside Park
coursing is run solely for the pleasure
of spectators and not in the Interest of
gain. iJ -;^
Ames Had Another Wife.
Tessie Ames, who on September 7, 189?,
married George Spencer Ames, was grant
ed judgment yesterday annulling the mar
riage contract. The plaintiff averred that
Ames had another wife when she mar- ,
ried him. Ames joined issues, in which ha
admitted in a matter of fact way that
the plaintiff's contention was true. Tha
court therefore annulled the marriage and
granted the plaintiff permission to resume
her maiden name, Tessle Skelly.
Death of James F. Miller.
James F. Miller Jr., son of Pilot James
Miller, died last Thursday evening of
consumption after a lingering illness. He
had acted as first and second officer for
the John D. Spreckel3 ' Bros. Company
and for the Alaska Transportation Com
pany.
addition to the speed which he can de
velop on a wheel by means of- his own
pedal extremities, has a , gasoline tricy
cle, which has heretofore been called by
the Eastern papers a "petroleum tan
dem," although why it Is hard to under
stand, as the terms represent .two en
tirely different machines.
Fournier's tricycle Is a marvelous
wheel. Seated upon it, without any ex
ertion on his part, he can reel Â«ff a hun
dred miles at a two-minute clip and en-
Joy his cigar at the same time. It is val
uable for both road and track use.
Yesterday morning the doughty French
man thought he would try the country
roads hereabouts for a little "century"
spin before lunch, and, learning that the
road to San Jose on this side of the bay
was muddy, betook himself to the ferry,
Intending to ride down on the Oakland
side. But the Southern Pacific officials
would not have it so. His vehicle was
in direct competition with their train busi
ness, and, furthermore, it is against the
rules to take gasoline aboard the ferries
in any form. â¢â¢ ,-â¢ v
Fournier does not speak or understand
English well, and protested in vain
against what he thought was their en
deavor to extort a large sum of money
from him for transporting his vehicle
across the bay. He was about to pay
the toll, however, when it dawned upon
him that he could not go over for any
amount of money. Then he hurled French
adjectives and invectives at the gatekeep
ers until he got tired, and finally rode
back to his hotel a much disgusted Gaul.
Fournier has had his wheel out in tne
park a couple of times since he arrived
here, and the police have offered no ob
jection, saying that it is no more liable
to scare horses than any other kind of a,
bicycle.

PEELER'S PLACE
Gage Seeks an Adju
tant General.
WANTS A TRAINED SOLDIER
MUCH TO DO IN REORGANIZING
THE NATIONAL GUARD.
The Governor Confers With the Col
onel Regarding Military Leg
islation Pending A De
sirable Office.
Ono of the most desirable places at the
Jlsposal of the Governor is that of adju
tant general of the State troops, with a
salary of $3000 a year attached, in addition
to the accompanying gold lace and brass
button?. Ever since the election of Gov
ernor Gage there has been an active
scramble for the position now held by
General Peeler, and almost every, county
In the State has at least one man who
looks longingly upon the coveted office.
Among the San Franciscans who have
been prominently talked of in connection
with the adjutant generalcy are Colonel
George Stone and J. C. Currier, but it has
been the genera! impression that the ad
jutant general would come from the
south.
it would appear that this impression Is
all wrong and that San Francisco is like
ly to get the place after all, and Colonel
William R. Smedberg's appointment is
hot among the improbabilities.
Governor Gage has evidenly reached the
conclusion that he ought to solicit the
views of leading military men on the sub
ject of National Guard reorganization.
Colonel W. R. Smedberg.
Yesterday Colonel Smedberg went to Sac
ramento and while there met the com
mander in chief and was invited to sub
mit his opinion as to the merits of. the
pending military legislation.
It is known that Governor Gage has
been looking over the field of aspirants
for the office of adjutant general, and
there Is an impression that he has had
Borne difficulty in rinding Just the right
man for the place. The report goes that
Colonel Smedberg's military record and
tils high standing as a citizen directed the
Governor's thoughts to him as an accept
able chief of staff.
Colonel Smedberg's appointment to the
office would not be surprising, in view of
the fact that the services of a trained and
thoroughly competent veteran officer are
needed to assist the Governor in the re
organization of the National Guard.
THE LABOR COUNCIL.
Officers Elected for the Next Term
. and Many New Delegates Seated.
The San Francisco Labor Council last
night elected the following officers for the
ensuing six months: Mose Davis, presi

New delegates were received as fol
lows: Sailors' Union. C. Jortall, Frank
Johnson; Carpenters' Union No. 483, Wal
ter Goff; Glass Blowers' Union, Louis
Benderwald, G. H. Hebrank.
Letters were received from Senator
Perkins and Congressmen Loud and Hil
born stating that they were in sympathy
with the council's action in opposing the
abolition of the postal savings bank sys
tem in Hawaii, and would do all in their
power to have It retained.
The delegate from the Musicians' Un
ion reported that a new union known as
the Pacific Coast Musicians' Society,
which has just applied for letters of in
corporation, is composed of men expelled
from the old union for violation of its
rules, and requested that no recognition
i" given it.
On motion of Mr. McAuliffe, the law and
legislative committee was instructed to
use all means within its power to pre
vent any more machinery being intro
duced into the State prisons. A bill is
now before the Legislature providing for
the purchase of nail-making machines for
Folsom and San Quentin, and this will
receive the first attention of the commit
tee.

posing conspicuously on the seat.
Culbert sauntered up and down the
platform, nor boarded his car again
until the train was beginning to
move. When he again sank into his
seat a fellow passenger leaned over
and asked:
"Say, Mister, did you lose your
pocketbook?"
Culbert made a hasty dive through
his pockets, and that Is when he was
stricken with all sorts of alarming
disorders. Culbert rapidly went
from bad to worse, until the man
who had first called his attention to
his loss proceeded to explain that a
man, who had left the train at
Tracy, in passing through the car
had seen the purse and picking it up
had sought the owner. Not finding
him, he had turned the property
over to Conductor Eugene Brown.
When Culbert had recovered suf
ficiently, he went in search of the
knight of the punch and soon had
the wallet, containing $S5, back in
his pocket, sewed in and still more
securely fastened with a safety
pin.
Mr. Culbert has since learned that
the gentleman who so carefully pro
tected his property was Mr. F. J.
Walker of the New Western Hotel
of this city, and has sent him a
slight token of his appreciation.
Culbert says it's remarkable how
scared a man can get and live
through it. yyyy.

CHOYNSKI`S MESSAGE
ON A BED OF DEATH
The Old Editor's Remarkable Farewell
ISIDOR N. CHOYNSKI, the aged and eccentric, although unusually able,
man whose life ended last Tuesday, died as he had livedâ at war with his en
vironment. For many years he criticized life and all life means, and when
the end came he unsparingly criticized death. It was through his newspa
per, Public Opinion, that he expressed his thoughts, and when he finally re
alized that death was upon him he determined that his paper should die
with him, and that through that paper he would send to the world in which
he moved his last message. v .â¢';':
While the old man tossed on his bed of fatal illness he composed his last
editorial, his summary of his life and his protest against the end. A few
days before the end the aged editor knew that his life was closing.. He fin
ished his editorial and on Saturday last It was published in the concluding
Issue of Public Opinion. This remarkable message of a dead hand is as fol
lows: *Â£ V"
The last lines, for print, which we wrote upon this earth are these: On Friday
morning last, it was Just 6 o'clock as we opened our eyes, there stood before us In
the open doorway a tall, gray-bearded man, the very picture of Father Time, and he
held a huge black sign In his hand, reaching from top to bottom of the door, upon
which was written in bold white type, German script, "Marked for death." It was
a fine greeting for a pleasant morning; but we opine that the Germans should not have
been so cruel, and not have shown themselves so inhuman. We saw all the . doctors
the evening before, and why not have given us a chance to put our place in order? It
Is a cruel, wicked world; we had our struggle. Good-by.
THE SAN FKAN CISCO .CALL, SATUKDAY, JANTJAKY 28, 1899.
WILL, C. CULBERT, who
travels for a local paper
company, has entirely re
covered from an attack of
heart failure, complicated
by a partial stroke of paralysis,
cold feet, loss of memory, clammy
persipratlon and nervous prostra
tion, all of which hit him while com
ing up from Bakersfleld last Mon
day, just after the train had left
Tracy, and left him in a mighty bad
way for a time. ;' ,' !.
Culbert always was an easy one
â for a drummer â but always
claimed to be able to take care of
himself and his purse, barring poker
and like mishaps. Now he is not
so confident of his ability in this re
spect. The man of grips and good
stories had been off on a long trip
and was anxious to get home. His
expenses had been heavy and that
may have accounted for his anxiety
and his subsequent critical condi
tion; had he been Just starting out
the loss of a hundred might not
have had such a disastrous effect.
But expense accounts must be kept
within reason, you know.
Well, at Tracy the train stopped
for fifteen minutes and Culbert got
off to stretch his legs. Previous to
that he had stretched them across
to the opposite seat in the Pullman,
assuming an attitude that permitted
the moulting of his pocketbook all
unknown to himself. When he left
the car the fat wallet was left re
State and the Weather Bureau offers no
assurance of an early change to cooler
weather. The north wind Is still endeav
oring to blow the top off Mount Tamal
pals and making such a freak of itself as
to cause Professor Hammon much dis
gust. ' : 2y;y.iry 'â 
Incidentally, the closest guess he has
made on the prospective weather con
nected with this hot wave, is that it will
be cooler as soon as the temperature falls.
As a result thereof the farmers are feel
ing quite encouraged.!
The recent rains have started the grass
growing finely ln the southern ranges and
cattlemen are stocking their ranches
with new stock and cattle' that were re
moved to Nevada. Utah and the northern
part of the State last fall, when the pas
turage failed. Ninety per cent of the
stock on ranges along the south coast and
the San Joaquin Valley was moved in
IS9B. The railroads are now hauling many
thousand head back to the original
ranges. At the same time the ranchers
are somewhat apprehensive over the dry
weather now prevailing and they say that
if it continues much longer great damage
will result. â â â '-â  â --' _ y, __ ,_
Reports received at the Southern Pacific
office are to the effect that in the Interior
the soil is drying out very fapidly and
more rain will be needed to insure a full
crop. There Is not only danger of the
heat blasting fruit and gain, but that
sharp frosts may follow with costly re
sults. It is, therefore, desired that Mr.
Hammon change the wind before attend
ing to anything else.

WOMEN OF
THE DIOCESE
IN CONVENTION

by the Divines.
REVIEW OF THE YEAR'S WORK
LORD BISHOP OF COLUMBIA
URGES DEVELOPMENT.
Bishop Leonard of Salt Lake on thÂ«
Mormon Question Services at
St. John the Evangelist
Church.
Tho semi-annual convention of the
Women's Auxiliary of the Episcopalian
Diocese of California was held yesterday
in the Church of St. John the Evangelist
on Fifteenth street. Right Rev. Bishop
Nichols celebrated the communion serv
ice, which opened the session at 11 a. m.
He was assisted by the Bishop of Olympia
as Epistoler, Bishop of Salt Lake as Gos
peler and the Lord Bishop of Columbia,
who preached the sermon. Bishop More
land was also present and Rev. E. B.
Spalding, rector of St. John's, acted as
master of ceremonies.
The choir was composed of Daughters
of the King, with Miss A. Phillips organ
ist.
Bishop William Willcox Perrin delivered
an eloquent address, taking for his sub
ject "Woman's Work in the Church."
He spoke of woman's work in society, in
education, her duty with regard to
divorce and her duty in the church of
God. He asserted that woman's place
was on the school board, and urged his
hearers to take an active interest in
politics affecting the education of chil
dren. He was desirous to see the expand
ing of the Women's Auxiliary, and referred
feelingly to the Episcopalian sisterhood,
who, with a self-sacrifice that is heroic,
consecrate themselves to God and to
God's work. He made a plea that a strong
protest be entered by the women against
those who had broken the laws of the
church with regard to the sacred nature
of the marriage ties. He concluded his
sermon by requesting his auditors to use
their influence for good, whether It be in
the home, in the church or in the world.
The offertory was for the benefit of tho
auxiliary, and the morning service closed
with the benediction. .
The society then adjourned to the guild
hall of the church with the Bishops and
clergy as guests for luncheon, and the
session was resumed at 2:30 in the after
noon, with representatives from twenty
branches present.
After the collect and the singing of the
Sixty-fifth Hymn, Bishop Nichols, who
resided, called on the Right Rev. Abiel
.eonard, Bishop of Salt Lake, for an ad
dress. He commenced by speaking of his
diocese, which he said comprised part of
Nevada, all of Utah, about half of Colo
rado and a section of Wyoming. "The
Women's Auxiliary," he said, "is not very
strong in Salt Lake, but there are hopes
for a better future. I believe we are per
forming good work among the Indians.
We have a tribe of 3000 just outside of
Utah. A chapel has been erected and
placed ln charge of a lay brother, who
has accomplised excellent results. There
is urgent need of more schools In my dis
trict. Other denominations are teaching
children for whom we should care."
Bishop Leonard then discussed the Mor
mon question at some length and referred
to the election of Congressman Roberts.
"The process of disintegration in the
Mormon church," he said, "is rapidly
going on. The Mormons are being edu
cated away from their belief and cus
toms. A Mormon has been elected to the
Congress of the United States and he is
charged with being a polygamlst. . Rob
erts will not deny nor admit that he is
Â«\ie. He says that the church is opposed
to polygamy.
"For my part I believe, there is little
polygamy In Utah. There Is some of it
going on, but 1 can not prove it. The pa
pers make charges and say the proofs
are clear, but 1 have no knowledge of my
own on the subject. I believe that the
polygamous practices are growing less as
the people are becoming more educated,
and it is the education we want to ad
vance.. ' . : '2:
"I see much that is good among the
Mormons. We are bound with them in.
business ways and in social . relations.
We don't want to fight them. We offer
our teachings and try to do all we can
ln the line of enlightenment. Of 250.000
people in Utah 200,000 are against us. But
as time goes on conditions are changing
and the truth is expanding."
Miss Bishop made an earnest plea for
contributions to the mission fund by the
Sunday-schools. Out of seventy schools
in the diocese with which she had com
municated she had heard from only
twenty-six, and hoped that all would con
tribute for next Whitsuntide.
Right Rev. William M. Barker, Bishop
of Olympia, then addressed the ladies and
said that woman exerts a wonderful in
fluence for good which should be devel
oped for the Master's sake. The possibil
ities of influence of the Women's Auxil
iary were simply enormous. Woman had
shaped the destiny of the world and it
was in her province to shape the destinies
of the glorious Episcopal church.
Bishop Nichols made a heart to heart
talk to the convention and spoke of the
administration of the work. He hoped
that the women would carry the auxiliary
to a high degree of progress. â  -r\
After prayer and benediction the con
vention adjourned.
The principal officers of the Women's
Auxiliary are: Mrs. James Newlands,
president; Mrs. Elizabeth F. Noble, first
vice president; Mrs. Richard M. Sherman,
second vice president; Mrs. A. M. Law
yer, secretary; Miss Kate W. Stoney, re
cording secretary.
UNCLE SAM'S REAL ESTATE.
Irving M. Scott Tells How He Ac
quired It and Defends It. â¢
Hon. Irving M. Scott delivered an in- |
teresting and instructive lecture last
evening at Metropolitan Temple under the
auspices of the California Camera Club. .
His subject, which was illustrated by
stereoptlcon views, was "How Uncle Sam
Acquired Ills Territory and How He De
fends It." A large audience gathered to
hear the distinguished speaker and his !
lecture was punctuated by outbursts of j
patriotic applause.
By means of maps and carefully pre
pared diagrams, he showed the condition
of tho United States at the time of the
destruction of the Spanish Armada, its
rapid growth afterward and the series
of grants which finally merged into the
thirteen original States. Also the acqui
sition of other territory, strategic points
of the Pacific Ocean and the position of
other nations regarding the same.
The building of battle ships, the mak
ing of guns and armor plate and the put
ting up of powder in charges were ex
plained and Illustrated by a superb col
lection of pictures.
Mr. Scott said Uncle Sam was able and
competent to take care of any acquired
territory, no matter where situated, and
i pointed to Alaska as an instance of such
ability. â¢ , t
During the Intermission T. H. Destrella
told in the sign language the stories of a
fishing excursion and a courtship, which
met with the marked favor of the audi
ence. -

Morosco Trouble . Settled.
The Building Trades Council has decided
to allow a gang of non-union paper-hang
ers to work in Morosco's Theater, and a
general strike of all the men employed in
remodeling the house has been j averted.
When the committee visited Mr. Morosco
he informed it that he was not aware that
_here .were any. , union men . working
Â^?s-____i__BÂ«9<r*_-ft. : _ .. ..yyy^
in his house and was very sorry to learn
that such was the case. The paper-hang
ing had been given out on contract to
Merchant & Nlcholls, and It was impossi
ble for him to dictate whom they should
employ. . A conference was held and the
contractors refused to discharge the men
without declaring the contract broken
and leaving the work in an unfinished
state. Mr. Morosco then offered to pay
the initiation fee of the four paper-hang
ers into the union. The committee re
ported back to the council Thursday
night, but that body decided to refuse Mr.
Morosco's offer with thanks and permit
the men to finish the job, as all other
work in the building . is and always has
been strictly union.
BENEFIT AT THE TIVOLL
In Aid of a Free Ward for the Eye
and Ear Hospital.
A benefit in aid of the free ward clinic
of the California Eye and Ear Hospital
will be given at the Tivoli Opera-house
on the night of February 9. The hospi
tal, which is in its infancy, has already
demonstrated its usefulness and necessi
ty, but it needs the helping hand of the
public that It may be endowed for its con
stantly growing needs. It Is the only in
stitution of its kind on the coast and
makes a specialty of the particular dis
eases which pertain to the ear, eye, nose
and throat. This specialty has In recent
years become so extensive and the present
methods of diagnosis and treatment are
so elaborate that a separate hospital de
voted to this branch of medicine and sur
gery alone is as well recognized as is the
specialist himself.
It is the ambition of the lady managers
of the institution to establish a free ward,
in which the deserving poor, who are un
able to pay their board, medical attend
ance or medicine, and who are totally de
pendent upon charity, may receive care
and attention. The free clinic has al
ready done an immense amount of good,
but the more serious cases met with are
difficult to cure without the constant pro
fessional watchfulness which can only be
found in a hospital.
The ladies are enthusiastically co-op
erating with the managers of the Tivoli
to make the opera, billed for the occa
sion, an absolute success. The tickets will
cost 50 cents and will be for sale at the
Tivoli or at the hospital after Febru
ary 2.
TRONCHET WON.
Small House Watches a Rattling
Broadsword Bout.
The "broadsword contest for the world's
1 championship between Louis Tronchet,
master at arms of the Olympic Club, and
; Ivan de Malchin of the Russian army," at
Woodward's Pavilion last night, was
J poorly attended. Announcement was
j made that owing to the small audience
the world's contest would be postponed
i and In Its place an hour's exhibition would
I be given for the benefit of those who had
I been kind enough to visit the Pavilion.
I Sergeant Moffltt of the United States
army was chosen as Judge and referee,
! and the two swordsmen went at it with a
i vim and vigor. The Russian was to all
j appearances the better swordsman of the
two, but Tronchet had a clever way of
! making short strokes and scoring points
I while De Malchin was making his artistic
I flourishes. Tronchet was finally declared
winner by a score of 15 to 7.

TAX COLLECTOR'S
DEPUTIES ARE
REFUSED PAY
Supervisors Hold Up
Their Warrants.
CLAIM THEY ARE ILLEGAL
SHEEHAN AFFIRMS HIS OFFICE
IS GREATLY HAMPERED.
A Large Volume of Business to Be
Handled and an Inadequate
â  Force of Clerks Will
Commence Suit.
Owing to a deadlock between Tax Col
lector Edward I. Sheehan and the finance
committee of the Board of Supervisors
the former claims that the business of
his office has been brought to a stand
still, and that the interests of the city
must inevitably suffer.
The controversy has developed over the
employment of extra deputies, whose
claims for salaries the committee will not
approve. They are not statutory offices
and the Supervisors claim they were not
employed in keeping with the law. It
appears that there is no hard and fast
rule in the premises; salaries have been
paid in the past under the same condi
tions.
Tax Collector Sheehan appeared before
the committee yesterday in person and
was also represented by Attorney E. A.
Bridgeford. He held that there was an
implied authorization, if not an expressed
one, permitting him to employ clerks
necessary in the transaction of the busi
ness of his office, and that it was the duty
of the board to Inform him before cut
ting him off. It had always been cus
tomary to increase the force of clerks at
this time of the year.
After the meeting Mr. Sheehan said he
would sue out a writ of mandamus
against the board on the first of Febru
ary to compel payment of the claims.
He said there was over $2,000,000 taxes to
be collected, and his present force was
Inadequate to handle such a volume of
business, which must of necessity suffer.
He said he had request from the banks
alone for 16,800 tax bills, which he could
not get ready. The committee has pre
pared the following report, which it will
submit to the board at its next meet
ing:
Your committee in the matter of extra
deputies or clerks required in the several
offices believe that it is a necessity for
your committee to be advised of the num
ber of extra clerks required prior to their
appointment In order that some Intelligent
action may be taken prior to the expendi
ture. It appears that the custom has been
to employ such extra deputies as the head
of the department had an impression was
needed and present the bills for services
rendered to your committee for approval.
Such a custom is pernicious, as it is done
without the knowledge of your honorable
board or your committee, and must lead to
great abuse If permitted to be exercised
without control. Your committee, acting
under the requirements of the statutes of
1871-72, was constrained to refuse to allow
the demands of extra clerks employed by
Mr. Sheehan, Tax Collector, he having
made no requisition and received no au
thority to employ such extra clerks. How
ever, in view of the fact that he only as
sumed the duties of his office this month,
It a satisfactory showing is made by him
showing the absolute necessity of their em
ployment and If the explanation Is satis
- factory, your committee may, under the
circumstances, allow said demands, . but
that officer and all other officers requiring
extra assistants or clerks hereafter
prior to creating any liability on the part
of the city, must make requisitions ln writ
ing to the finance committee at least Aye
days before the expiration of the month
prior to the month the extra assistants are
required, setting forth the number required
and the particular services for which they
are required, so that your committee may be
advised of the expenditures made prior to
the liability being created, and in order that
the rules and regulations may be observed
we will submit a resolution to that effect for
your action.
The deputies whose warrants have been
held up are: J. A. McDonald, Charles H.
Ward, Joseph, A. Fitzpatrick, P. J. Mee
han, John Toomey, John Doyle, O. V.
Mendenhall, H. C. Maguire and Homer

PYTHIANS CONSOLIDATE.
Two of the City Lodges Are Made
One and the Membership En
joys a Banquet.
Pursuant to one of the most unique In
vitations ever prepared nearly two hun
dred Knights of Pythias met In Pythian
Castle last night to witness the consol
idation of Golden City and Metropolitan
lodges. The uniting of the two lodges
was by Herman Schaffner, grand keeper
of records and seal, assisted by a corps
of officers, and the work was performed
In a very interesting and impressive man
ner. At the close of the ceremony the
membership of the consolidated lodges I
and those who were present by invita
tion marched to the liaison St. Germain, |
where a fine supper was served. The j
consolidating officer was the master of |
ceremonies and after the menu had been j
disposed of he called for responses to !
toasts. The speakers were: Past Grand
Chancellor George Samuels, Past Grand I
Chancellor George H. Morrison, Thomas I
A. Nerney, lieutenant commander naval
militia; Dr. G. S. Bachman, Past Grand j
Chancellor XV. H. Bouflsh. Past Grand
Chancellor Ernest TJlman, Dr. J. C. Ste- :
venson and Past Grand Chancellor Nu- i
mar Rose. There were others who re- ;
sponded to volunteer toasts, and there I
was also music and songs. It was 1
o'clock this morning before the jolly I
party sang "Auld Lang Syne."

azines. How he found relief Is best told in hia
own words:
"Some weeks ago my brother heard me say
something about Indigestion, and taking a box
from his pocket said, 'Try Stuart's Tablets.'
I did, and was promptly relieved. Then I In-
vestigated the nature of the tablets and be-
came satisfied that they were made of Just
the right things and in Just the right propor-
tions to aid In the assimilation of food. I
heartily endorse them in all respects, and Z
jceep them constantly on hand."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â The changes as a re
sult of to-day's trading were rather mixed,
with gains predominating. The market opened
with hesitancy but this was speedily dissi
pated by an influx of buying orders and the
market started up under the Influence of
strength in the low priced specialties and
standard stocks. London was a free seller on
balance, the sales amounting to 30,000 shares,
which encouraged the room traders to put out
large short lines to check the rise.
Commission houses held a large volume of
buying orders well distributed throughout the
list, which forced the bears to take back
stocks after effecting only a slight relapse in
the market's strength. Prices were forced up
under the leadership of the Flower shares,
Including Rock Island, People's Gas and Brook
lyn Rapid Transit. The low priced stocks were
then taken in hand. Tennessee Coal and Iron
moved up ... American Spirits preferred 2,
Wheeling and Lake Erie preferred 4_, first
preferred 4, Pacific Mall 2_, and Indianapolis
and Louisville preferred 3. Among the t spe
cialties there were advances of 2% in Rubber
and 2 in Sugar, while Metropolitan moved
within 2 points. There was an average rise of
over a point In the Grangers, except North
west. The largest rise in this group was that
of Rock Island, 1%. The coalers, Morgan
stocks and 1.'.. C, C. and St. Louis were quiet.
Long Island Jumped S% and Norfolk and West
ern preferred, on large transactions, advanced
1%. The move ln the latter was attributed to'
talk of an Increase in the dividend. Lake Erie
and Western and Chicago Great Western "A"
rose in the neighborhood of 2 points. The
news accompanying the advance included the
favorable report of the Senate Commerce Com
mittee on the steamship subsidy bill benefited
Pacific Mail; an explanation that the new beet
eugar company would not invade the Ameri
can Sugar Refining Company's territory and
a number of favorable traffic statements, in
cluding those of Northern Pacific and Southern
Railway. The denial of the rumored New York
"Central transcontinental plans was responsi
ble fur early losses in Union Pacific, which
subsequently rallied,' closing fractionally off
for the day. Transactions were ln excess of
1,000,000 shares, as on other days this week.
Considerable Irregularity prevailed in the
bond market with active issues favoring a
downward course. - Total sales, 16,215,000. Bid
quotations for Government bonds were un
changed.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Jan. 27.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The Stock Exchange clearing house, here
broke down last night owing to the heavy set
tlement in Americans and Africans, hence
business was Impeded to-day. Nevertheless,
Africans were rampant and Americans were
brisk. The latter began dull. Mr. Vanderbilfs
denial of the consolidation report caused a drag
ln the early hours. Then an American house
got a big buying order in Louisville and Nash
ville and New York came good, which renewed
the excitement, and buyers tumbled over each
other to get stock. Later prices eased off.
Finally Berlin bought Northern Pacific. New
York bought Union Pacific preferred, which is
Upped strongly here. v^-: â¢ ..-
Anaconda touched 8% on heavy New York
purchases.
There was a strong demand for call money,
owing to the clearing house hitch. In bills
there was no business.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â Bradstreefs Finan
cial Review to-morrow will say: One of those
speculative outbreaks which occur at regular
Intervals in the history of the commercial
countries is now in full progress in the United
States, with Wall street as, the scene for Its
principal manifestations. The present week
has witnessed further advances of the kind
which only occurs when the public comes Into
the market almost en masse and purchases
eagerly and even recklessly. This has caused
the transactions in stocks to assume dimen
sions never before- seen in this market. The
dealings have been excited, especially on Mon
day morning, when the rush of buying orders
"at the market were such as to cause wild
j advances in some stocks and not a little tempo
| ran' confusion. The mechanism of the stock
j board and of the street at large have, however,
worked well, the stock clearing system being In
| no small degree responsible for this fact. Money
1 continues to be exceptionally easy, there being
no symptoms whatever of the hardening of in- i
terest rates, which usually appeared on former
occasions when extremely active speculation j
has developed. This exceptional state of af
fairs is due no doubt to the circumstances that
our market, in contrast to its position in IsSO
or in the other "booms" of the past, is not
now borrowing money abroad with which to
carry on the current speculation, but Is actu- j
ally landing large amounts to London and the j
Continent. It may be noted that while Lon- |
don follows the proceedings here with great ;
interest and has evert shown, a sympathetic j
tendency toward increased speculative activ- |
ity on its own account, it has been, on the !
whole, a seller of our securities; or, to put the j
case ln another way, prices here have ad
vanced so much and rapidly that London has
not kept pace with us, and arbitrage opera
tions, involving the buying of American stocks
in London and their resale here, has resulted
in the shipment of considerable amounts of se
curities from Europe to New York.
The controlling factor in the market has,
however, been the continued increase of specu
lative purchasing orders from the public, not
only in New York but throughout the coun
try. Wall street commission houses have had
ati influx of such business to an extent hith
erto unknown, and In many cases their facili
ties have been almost overwhelmed by the de
tail work which it involved. It is however, a
notable circumstance that as a rule firms of
! this class, which naturally profit by the whole
sale entrance of the public into the market,
have generally been recommending conserva
tism and profit tailing to the customers. In
fact, the street has appeared to be somewhat i
backward, while the public has showed de- j
cided evidence of speculative confidence. Then- ;
has, of course, been heavy realizing from time j
to time and not a little shifting of the public's |
buying from one part of the list to another.

BRADSTREET'S ON THE CONDITION OF
TRADE.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â Bradstreet's to-mor- ,
row will say: The apparently steady rise In i
the tide of general business has been diversified
this week by an outburst of speculative inter
est in a number of staples, ; notably cotton and 1
wheat, which heretofore have registered steady j
THE .SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 28, â¢1899.
gains on actual consumptive demand rather
than on the development of marked bullish
speculation. Large transactions and buoyant
prices have been features In these staples and
signs are not wanting that sympathetic though
smaller movements in a number of the other
lines are either under way or contemplated.
Exceptional Industrial activity in the Iron and
steel trades Is another feature of note, and
here, too, price advances are all but general,
reflecting, so far as can be seen, chiefly the
urgency of consumers' requirements, the claim,
In fact, being made that speculation has not
as yet entered into buying in this branch of
Industry. The same claim, however, can
hardly be made as regards a number of move
ments toward consolidation in this and other
industries, where in fact the movements to
ward combination are tiesired as approach
ing a virtual craze. In the regular channels
of distributive trade conditions continue In the
main satisfactory, the volume of spring orders
at most markets being reported as larger than
in any recently preceding year at this time.
While It is hardly possible to fix the entire
responsibility for the bullishness in wheat and
corn upon the movement which so far has
proved so successful in stocks the claim is
freely made that considerable profits realized
in the stock market have sought expression in
the channels of staple food and textile dis
tribution. Color is given to this claim by the
fact that the situation In actual wheat shows
but little change from recent weeks. It Is true
there is a tendency to pare down alleged official
estimates of Russian crops and some weather
reports from the West have been more encour
aging to the holders of actual wheat, but the
magnitude of the outburst of new buying
shared in by former persistent shorts ln wheat
alone hardly explains the activity in this mar
ket, which has resulted In the highest prices
reached since the collapse of the Letter deal.
Activity In demand for nearly all classes of
Iron and steel Is reflected In advances for nearly
every class of plgiron and ln steel billets, rails,
wire and plates. Announcements of a large
number of consolidations and combinations pro
jected or under way are also a feature In the
domain of other metals, notably copper and
tin; speculation and actual demand alike make
for higher prices. Better reports are received
from the lumber trade ln a number of cities
and all the old advances are maintained, with
confidence in the outlook for spring business.
Some improvement in the dry goods trade la
to be noted at some Eastern points, notably
Philadelphia and Boston, where advances are
maintained. Wool, though firm, is slow of
sale, and finished products, with the possible
exception of dress goods, do not move as freely
as hoped for, a feature this week, ln fact, be
ing the very low prices announced by some
manufacturers. General industry is reported
active, notably soft coal mining and ship
building. An encouraging feature in the for
mer trade has been the wage settlement made
with 100,000 Western coal miners for another
year.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 4,999,752 bushels, against 6,198,
--671 last week, 5,026.024 in the corresponding
week of 1898. 2.615,408 in 1597. 2,660.205 in 1896
and 2.483,858 in 1895. Since July 1. this season,
the exports of wheat aggregate 144,322,291 bush
els, against 146,494,889 last year.
Business failures are fewer in number, aggre
gating 246, against 262 last week, 288 ln this
week a year ago. 326 in 1597, 393 in 1596 mid 312
ln 1896.
Business failures for the Dominion of Can
ada for the week number 32, against 30 last
week, 49 ln this week a year ago, 66 ln 1597,
63 in 1596 and 66 in 1595.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â G. Dun & Co.'s
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
The country is in a stronger position than a
week ago. Remarkable strength in its Indus
tries is an Important but not the chief ele
ment. Public confidence in the business of the
country and in its securities has been tested to
an unusual extent by the sudden fall In stocks
and the subsequent rise. Confidence ln the
value of wheat, corn and cotton has been shown
by the markets, and at rising prices the world
buys because It has to buy. The vast supply
of unemployed capital has been shown impres
sively, and the new and startling Independence
of foreign money markets fixes attention. The
lumber movement is unusually large for the
season, with prices of low grades sharply ad
vancing. Railroad earnings and tonnage have
shown surprising gains. Treasury receipts are
gaining, and a vote on the peace treaty has
been fixed for February 6.
The weak points in the situation may first
be considered. Wool trows weaker, because
forced by speculation a year ago to prices
which the market for goods could not sus
tain and has been much embarressed in trying
to sustain ever since. Western bankers begin
to advise speculative holders to sell. The sales
of wool are still small, manufacturers buying
at Philadelphia, where prices are yielding,
rather than at Boston, where great efforts are
made to sustain them, but the goods movement
for heavy weights is still disappointing and
comparatively slow. Larger orders for light
weights keep many works employed. Sales for
the week have been 6,403,400 pounds, and for
four weeks 22,899,200. against 30.421,070 last
year and 26,547,600 for two years ago.
Plgiron has risen at Chicago because of
higher freight rates from the South, and at
Pittsburg a shade for Bessemer and gray forge
because of growing demand, but for the mo
ment a rise of 2 per cent ln pig Is exceeded
by the rise ot 2 per cent products. The pres- '
sure for many products Is such that the works
are able to make their own Quotations, and
rails and bars at Pittsburg and wire nails have
slightly advanced. The demand is heavy In all
lines, covering 000. tins rails In one contract
for a Southwestern road and many of smaller
quantity; 20.000 tons bars and many for a
less quantity; covering 5000 steel cars for the
Baltimore and Ohio, with other ship, car and
miscellaneous contracts, numerous bridge con
tracts, with one pending from Canada, and
others from all parts of the world 10,000 tons
sheets at Pittsburg, with heavy business else
where, and a general demand never surpassed.
Nails are advanced by the combination; pipe
works are crowded', and negotiations In progress
for their consolidation, as also in bridge build-
ing.
Wheat has risen 8 cents, with much buying,
Pased on extraordinary exports from Atlantic
ports for the week. Flour Included, shipments
were 8,818,301 bushels, against 2.971.333 last
year from Pacific ports, 221.255 against 1.180,
--272 last week, and from other ports 462.454. In
four weeks the exports from both coasts have
been 19.675.087 bushels, against 16.718.925 last
year. Reports of Injury to winter wheat al
ways come at this season, but count for little
when the farmers are selling heavily.
Failures for the week have been 224 In the
United States, against 342 last year, and 33
In Canada, against 34 last year. ;. â¢

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET. .' 2
CHICAGO, Jan. Wheat started ; under
much less excitement than It closed yesterday,
but with no Indication that the bull feeling had
abated to any considerable extent. May opened
a shade higher at from 78c down to 77% c, and
while some outside buying orders were being
executed Improved to 78%@75%c. After this
demand had been satisfied several local specu
lators evinced an Inclination to sell, not only
parting with long Wheat that showed a profit,
but trying the short side -In an experimental
and conservative fashion. As there seems to
be a disposition on the port of â  traders with
Wall street connection to let matters settle
somewhat before taking on fresh holdings the
market became heavy and May declined to
77% c. When the Atlantic port exports of Wheat
and Flour, amounting to 952,000 bushels, were
reported, the crowd made a wild scramble to
buy and May shot up to 79c. That was a rise
of l%c for the day, and the temptation to se
cure profits became so strong that many hold-/ 1
ers sold out and May slumped off to 77% c. IJur/
Ing the last fifteen minutes buying again [b/
--came spirited and May rose to. 78% c, the abas
ing price. v '
Cold weather and increased country offerings
started Corn easy. During the last hour of
the session rumors of heavy Wall street buying
started the crowd to cover and May rallied a
. cent from the low point of the day, closing with
an advance of %c.
Oats kept In close touch with Corn, although
It did not show as much gain as did the leader.
The speculative !.* trade > was slow and the
demand for cash was limited to car lots. May

CALIFORNIA DRIED FRUITS IN NEW
YORK.
NEW YORK, Jan. 27.â The Journal of Com
merce says: While there Is no speculative in
terest shown in California dried fruits it Is
reported the demand from consumers of late
has shown marked improvement. Exporters
have bought comparatively little, but they,
too, are more disposed to buy. With spot
stocks comparatively small and for the most
part in few and strong hands, an Increased
buying Interest on the part of both home and
foreign consumers Is said to be having the
effect of strengthening the views of sellers,
and the latter are holding back, waiting for
bids. Raisins appear to be about the only
article on the list the future of which Is un
certain. - Everything depends upon the ability
of the Growers' Association to carry through
Its new plan. The opinion Is freely expressed
here that packers will not sign contracts In
sufficient numbers to enable the association to
carry out Its plans, and this, together with
the opposition raised by Eastern commission
merchants, may. it Is believed, lead to an
early dissolution of the f organization. The
friends of the latter, however, say it has
enough strength to overcome all opposition.

ENGAGED TO WED
MISS JANE HODGE?
An Announcement Which Has Stirred
Society Circles in East
'Ml- % Oakland.
The Capitalist Is Over Seventy Years of
|Â§3 -/ Age and His Alleged Fiancee Is
His Niece by Marriageâ The
Betrothal Denied.
OAKLAND, Jan. 27.â "The engage
ment is announced of John
Nicholl of 1351 Fourth avenue and
Miss Jane Hodge of Lester aye
.. nue. East Oakland.''
; This little social item recently pub
lished aroused much curiosity in Oak
land, where John Nicholl and his fam
ily are well known. Nicholl is a man
of eat wealth. He was the owner of
a. large portion of Point Richmond,
which he sold to the Valley Railroad.
He also owns several valuable proper
ties in' the heart of the city.
John. Nicholl is over 70 years of age
and- has been a widower for many
years. His family is all grown up and
several of his children are married and
live.-near him. His palatial home is on
Fourth avenue, where he resides with
two- unmarried daughters. No one
kfie'w that the old millionaire had any
idea, .-of ever again taking a mistress
into his home and the announcement
created genuine surprise. No one, not
e.Veiii his intimate friends whom he
â "iriee.ts every day, had any occasion to
think that Nicholl was looking for an
other wife and the news of the engage
ment, was therefore regarded as a mis
take.
-. Now it is stated positively that the
iioti.ce of the engagement is false and
rhat'-it is part of a mystery that is
..â¢ally being solved. Miss Nicholl
and Mrs. Wilson, two daughters of the
; it'alist. declare that the story of
their' father's engagement is false and
they cannot "understand why it should
b.'ive'been published.
-There have been rumors during: the
past few days that the capitalist might
soon appear as the defendant in a
breach of promise suit. Nothing: defi
nite has been developed, and the story
Is scoffed at by Nicholl's relatives, but
still the mysterious announcement of
the engagement stands and there is
something yet to be told.
Miss Jane Hodge is a niece of John
Nicholl, and it is said that she has
NEVILLS COMPLICATES
RAWHIDE LITIGATION
FILE?. A NEW,. SUIT AGAINST
MABTIN AND BALLABD.
Garret McEnerney Appears as Coun- ;
sel for the App Consolidated
Gold Mining Company.
â¢: Litigants are cropping up and compli
cations, are assuming a more serious con
dition in the battle now on for the posses
sion pf the. celebrated App and Rawhide
mines. Yesterday the motion on behalf
Â§ of. Martin and Ballard, Captain Nevills'
mining partners, to fix the amount of
bond on appeal from the order appoint
-.rngMyer Jacobs receiver of the big mines
was. heard and denied by Judge Hebbard.
. A = petition was then presented by Garret
â¢'McEnerney, on behalf of the App Con
: solidated Gold Mining Company, In which
â â 'ihe 'court was requested to revoke the
-.Order, appointing the receiver.
'. â¢'â¢"."_ â¢ â .:!]-' original complaint he stated
that the App Consolidated Gold Mining
Company was represented by himself and
two. partners, each holding one-third of
the stockâ in fact, intimating that the
company was simply a dummy corpora
tion, â¢-. representing the copartnership.
This is denied in the petition presented
by Attorney McEnerney, and it is stated
trial the stock in this corporation is held
by various mining men. This puts a new
. status to the case, and Monday morning
the proofs substantiating the various as
sertions of the petition will be presented
'â arid the motion to revoke the order ap
pointing the receiver will be argued.
,': - ;_.ate yesterday afternoon another suit
â¢ .was filed by Nevills and his wife, involv
ing 16,666 2-3 lares of the mining com
.ji'any. j In the complaint the court is
prayed to declare that this amount of
stock, . which represents the interests of
.Martin and Ballard, is simply held in
trust by them for the benefit of the plain
tiffs.

he should fail to whip his opponent
"handily. rthorn, it is said, has

op. t*he rocks, near Caspar, Mendocino
County, on January 13 of this year, and

their decision, suspending Carl Schll

one year. The evidence showed that the

â¢tabic, no soundings nor any cross bear
ings from the Fort Bragg light and the
â¢Caspar slat) Are. The mate was in charge

seen not less than half a century of
life. She could not be induced to
answer the door bell to-night to tell
what she might know in the latest
sensation in Peralta Heights society.
She lives in a cottage on Lester avenue,
about a couple of blocks from the beau
tiful Nicholl residence.
John Nicholl could not be seen at his
home to-night, and one of his daugh
ters, who said that she was authorized
to speak for her father, was very re
ticent. She denied the fact of the en
gagement, however.
"It is simply a fake," she said, "and
we don't care to talk about it. My
father read the announcement of the
engagement and has nothing to say.
So far as his transferring certain prop
erty to an Incorporation is concerned,
he has been doing that for the past
two years." >...-..
She frankly stated that she was ac
quainted with Miss Hodge, but refused
to give her address. When asked as
to whether Mr. Nicholl denied the pub
lished announcement. Miss Nicholl de
clined to answer, and ended the inter
view.
Mrs. Lou Wilson, another daughter of
John Nicholl, residing at 1272 Fifth
avenue, was also questioned and she
emphatically denied the statement.
"There is absolutely nothing in it,"
she said, "because my father told me
so."
She stated also that Miss Jane Hodge
was a niece of Mr. Nicholl, and that she
did not know where the lady lived, only
that it was on Lester avenue. She
could not see what object any one could
have in publishing the engagement
when there was no truth in it and as to
a report of Miss Hodge's intention to
sue on a breach of promise she could
not see what grounds there were for
such action.
No member of the family will give
any explanation of the announcement
of the engagement, except to deny that
there ever was any such intention to
marry on the part of Mr. Nicholl, and
all refused to discuss the part taken in
the affair by Miss Jane Hodge, except
to admit that she is a niece of the capi
talist.
MRS. REGAN KEPT
CHASING KENNEDY
WITNESSES TESTIFY TO HEB
WATCHING FOB HIM.
Defendant Was So Affected by the
Strain That She Was Led From
the Courtroom in Tears.
The preliminary examination of Mrs.
Elizabeth Regan, charged with the murder
of Policeman Thomas H. Kennedy, was
continued before Judge Graham yester
day. A large number of witnesses were
examined, but nothing of a sensational
nature was brought out.
Most of the witnesses were put on the
stand by Attorney Barrett for the prose
cution to disprove Mrs. Johnston's state
ment at the Coroner's inquest that her
sister wanted to get rid of Kennedy, but
he was constantly pestering her. It was
shown by several witnesses that Mrs.
Regan was always running after Kennedy
and watched for him at places where, he
used to call or pass. Some of these wit
nesses were Park Policemen Arellanes
and Norton, ox-Policeman Wilkinson,
Mrs. E. M. Rogers, Detective Cody. Wil
liam Spaight, William Michelson, Mar
garet Kennedy and George M. Cesar.
Mrs. Victoria Wagner was again re
called and denied emphatically that she
had ever told any one of a conversation
she had with Mrs. Regan, when Mrs.
Regan told her she was going to marry
Kennedy and had torn a photograph of
Gertrude Sohrman, Kennedy's fiancee,
into pieces.
Miss Sohrman resumed her testimony
and said that she was to have been mar
ried to Kennedy before May 1 this year.
The Sunday before he was killed he had
urged her to marry him the next day as
he was afraid of Mrs. Regan. The last
time she saw him alive was the night be
fore his death. For six months Mrs.
Regan was asked by Kennedy at the re
quest of witness to give up all thought
of him. Sometimes she would agree and
at other times she would declare she
would have his heart's blood if he married
any other woman. Witness kept Ken
nedy's money and at- the time he joined
the force she had $385 and she gave him
$100 to buy his uniform. This contradicted
Mrs. Regan's statement that she helped
to buy Kennedy's uniform.
When the court adjourned Mrs. Regan
was In tears and she continued to weep
all the way to the City Prison. The ex
amination will be resumed Tuesday morn
ing.

Yesterday afternoon Dr. O'Donnell s

CHINESE ROBBERS.
Four Highbinders Loot the Safe of a
Ross Alley Gambling Den.
A bold robbery by Chinese highbinders
took place early yesterday morning in the
Chinese gambling house of Xi Fook, 32
Ross alley, off Jackson street.
At a quarter to 6 o'clock four highbind
ers, without the slightest attempt to dis
guise themselves or to conceal their fea
tures, entered, the premises through the
front door, which they had opened with a
skeleton key.
In the gambling room are two bunks,
one close to the floor and the other close
to the ceiling. A Chinese attendant of the
club was asleep in each. One of the rob
bers climbed the ladder leading to the
upper bunk, thrust the muzzle of a Colt's
navy revolver in the face of the aston
ished occupant and threatened to blow
out his brains If he dared to move or
make an outcry. The other robbers poked
their pistols into the face of the man in
the lower bunk and demanded the key
of the safe under penalty of death should
he refuse.
He surrendered the keys and the rob
bers opened the safe and appropriated
its contents, amounting to $397. Then they
went out into the alley and disappeared.
The gambling house is incorporated un
der the laws of this State as the Occiden
tal Union Club.
The police have been notified of the rob
bery. y.:,,' ; :y. y?.il ,-' .V-. y

The appropriations set aside by the Su

year, will be acted upon separately. Each
has its supporters among the members

all the propositions. The board will pass
upon the most important of them on Mon
day, when bids will be opened for the con
struction of the Seventeenth-street Police

tract at that time if it so desires. The
others will be acted upon separately.

Mexico.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 27.â The an-
nouncement . that there was a genuine
case of smallpox at the County Hospital
produced considerable of a sensation
here to-day. The name of the patient
is Albert Honedin. He came from Oak
land a few days ago and was ill. Hav
ing no means he was sent to the hos
pital for treatment. His illness con
tinued and yesterday the unmistakable
smallpox rash broke out on him. Dr.
G. A. White, the superintendent, has re
moved the patient to the isolated ward
intended for the care of such cases and
all the patients in the general hospital
have been vaccinated. There is be
lieved to be no likelihood whatever of
a spread of the malady, Dr. G. A.
White and the local Board of Health
having taken every precaution.
Dr. W. P. Mathews, secretary of the
State Board' of Health, said to The
Call correspondent this afternoon that
there were in this State at present
about six cases of smallpox, but not a
greater number. All, said the doctor,
had their origin in Arizona. The cases
exist in the southern part of the State,
several having been reported from Los
Angeles and San Bernardino. Dr.
Mathews said that cases have been de
tected coming from New Mexico. A
thorough quarantine has been estab
lished on the California State line to
prevent the further introduction of the
disease. â¢
Honedin, the patient confined at the
County Hospital, says he recently
passed through New Mexico and It is
believed he became exposed to the dis
ease in the locality to which Dr.
Mathews refers.
HIEIER PLACED ON TRIAL.
Ran Over and Instantly Killed Eliz
abeth A. Finley Last August.
John J. Hieier, the brewery wagon
driver, who on August 29 last ran over
and instantly killed Elizabeth A. Finley
at the corner of Bush and Larkin streets,
was placed on trial before Judge Cook
and a jury yesterday morning on a charge
of manslaughter.
A score of witnesses were on hand to
give testimony. H. C. "Vanmarle testified
that he saw Mrs. Finley start to cross the
street, and then, to his horror, saw her
knocked down by the horses and crushed
beneath the wheels. She was wheeling? _
baby in a little buggy, and the child, Was
thrown to the street, though not seriously'
Injured; and the little buggy-was.tom'tp;
pieces. - Joseph Corbett also witnessed the
accident. The prisoner simply looked
around, the witness said, after he drove
over the unfortunate woman, and then
hurried on. The witness jumped into his
buggy and followed the driver of ' the
brewery wagon, and caught him on Fine
street, near Polk. Corbett informed Hieier
that he had killed a woman, "but," said
the witness, "he did not seem to appre
ciate what I was saying; he seemed stupe
fied." Corbett took a piece of the baby
buggy from the brake block of the brew
ery wagon, where it 'had lodged, and took
it back to the scene of the accident. Cor
bett then informed a police officer, and
Hieier was placed under arrest. Other
witnesses corroborated the story given
by Vanmarle and Corbett, and the case
went over until to-day.

VERY COSTLY HUNTING.
W. N. Concannon Arrested for Shoot-
ing Pheasants in Fresno
County.
W. N. Concannon, the contractor, was
down in Fresno County a short time ago
and while there indulged in a little hunt
ing that is likely to prove very, expensive.
He had a contract to build a bridge,, and
when the work was nearly done he went
out for game with his shotgun. By some
ill luck Concannon ran across a beauti
ful Mongolian pheasant, one of a lot that
the State Fish Commissioners had been
at a great expense to have brought from
China for propagating purposes.
. A number of these game birds had been
liberated â¢ . near Sanger by ; the Fresno
Sportsmen's Club, and all over the coun
try notices were posted warning hunters
that it Is against the law to kill or molest
this kind of protected game. The tempta
tion was too great and Concannon shot at
the bird, cutting out a lot' of feathers,
' but he failed to secure the fowl. This
was bad enough, but not satisfied to let
well enough alone he boasted of what he
had done in the presence of a number of
sportsmen Interested in the preservation
of the new game birds.
In a very short time A. N. Ferguson,
Game Warden of Fresno County, was in
full possession of the facts and he swore
out a warrant for the arrest of the offend
er before Justice C. P. Walker of- Sanger.
Yesterday Deputy Sheriff J. S. Irvine of
Fresno County called at Concannon's of
fice ln the Crocker. building and when the
contractor came placed him under . ar
rest. The would-be pheasant shooter was
obliged to hustle around for $100 ball for
his appearance in the Justice Court .of
Sanger. Later in the afternoon he called
at the office of the Fish and Game Com
mission to see if the matter could be fixed
up without his being obliged to go to
Fresno, but he received a very chilly re
ception by the men who have expended
so much money to get the pheasants
from- China. The Fresno officer states
that, the people In his county are very in
dignant 'at the contractor's attempt to
kill the beautiful bird and that Concan
' '
non is likely to receive the full benefit of
the law for the offense.
A Judge's Compliment.
United States Circuit Judge Morrow
paid a High compliment yesterday morn
ing to Marshal P. Wood worth, First As
sistant United States Attorney. The court
said that Mr. Woodworth was worthy of
praise for the fidelity with which he was
attending to the duties of his office. He
had never been absent from a single ses
sion of court, and Judge Morrow modestly
added that he himself used to do likewise
when he occupied the same office, and he
was gratified to find that Mr. Woodworth
was faithfully following his example.
Varnishers and Polishers.
At the meeting of the union of Varnish
ers and Polishers last night it was de
cided to join the Labor Council, and Otto
Schulz was chosen as delegate.

YOUNG AT SIXTY.
Serene comfort and happiness in ad-
vanced years are realized by compara-
tively few women.
Their hard lives, their liability to se-
rious troubles on account of their pecu-
liar organism and their profound igno-
rance concerning themselves, all com-
bine to shorten the period of usefulness
and fill their later years with suffering.
Mrs. Tinkham has done much to make
women strong. She has given advice
to many that has shown them how to
guard against disease and retain vigor- '
ous health in old age. From every cor-
ner of the earth there is constantly com-
ing the most convinciug statements
from women, showing the efficacy of
Lydia E. "Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound in overcoming female ills. Here
is a letter from Mrs. J. C. Orms, of 220
Homer St. , Johnstown, Pa., which is
earnest and straight to the point :
'â¢ Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â I feel it my
duty to tell all suffering women that I
think your remedies are wonderful. I ,
had trouble with my head, dizzy spells
and hot flashes. Feet and hands were
cold, was very nervous, could not sleep
well, had kidney trouble, pain in
ovaries and congestion of the womb. .
Since taking your remedies I am better
every way My head trouble is all
gone, nave no pain in ovaries, and am
cured of womb trouble. I can eat and
sleep well and am gaining in flesh. I
consider your medicine the best to be
had for female troubles."
The present Mrs. Pinkham's experi-
ence in treating female ills' is unparal-
lelled, for years she worked side by
side with Mrs. Lydia E. Pinkham, and
for sometime past has had sole charge
of the correspondence department of
her great business, treating by letter
as many as a hundred thousand ailing
women during a single year.

plain of sleeplessness, loss of memory and weak

REPORTS TO THE POLICE
\ c
PRINCIPAL GREENMAN USED A
HEAVY STRAP.
The Mother Says She Condoned a
Similar Offense of a Teacher
Some Months
Ago.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 27.
Mrs. Corte of Brooklyn Township called
on the Chief of Police and the County
Superintendent of Schools to-day, exhib
iting numerous black and blue bruises
on her 10-year-old boy, as proof of a se
vere beating she declares he received from
Principal Greenman of the Lockwood
School. According to Mrs. Cortes story,
there is pressing need for an investiga
tion of the methods In vogue in the Lock
wood School for punishing children.
"This is the second time my boy has
been severely beaten," said Mrs. Corte.
"On a former occasion he was beaten by
Mrs. Comstock, and when I went to the
school and made complaint the teacher
said she was very sorry and asked me
not to say any more about it. She said
that she did not know she had so much
muscle and could mark a boy so much
by beating him. She came to my house
and was so sorry that I regretted having
shown the neighbors the marks on the
boy.
Yesterday my boy came home with a
dozen bruises on him. which had been
Inflicted by Principal Greenman with a
heavy leather strap. His limbs were so
inflamed that I had to bathe him and
attend to him all night, and this morn
ing he could hardly put his right foot,
to the ground. I went to the principal
and he admits beating the boy, and was
surprised when he saw how Willie is cov
ered with bruises. I have placed the
matter in the hands of Chief Fletcher
and he advised me to see Superintendent
Crawford. Mr. Crawford said that If
the circumstances are as represented. It
would be a case for prosecution, and
Judge Larue, who also Inspected the boy.
has advised rm? to swear out a warrant
for Greenman's arrest.
"The whole trouble arose from my boy
Ficklng up a pebble in the school yard.
n order to prevent the boys throwing
rocks a rule has been passed that there
shall be severe punishment for even pick
ing up a pebble. Willie picked up a peb
ble and was reported, and Greenman lost
his temper and beat the boy most un
reasonably."
THE LEAGUE IS A
DULY AUTHORIZED BODY
ITS CANDIDATES WILL COME UP
_0R ELECTION.
Gossip of the â Approaching
Convention of Independent Re
publicans and Democrats.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 27.
. There Is no foundation for any of the
reports that the ticket of the Municipal
League will not be recorded or that the
league must circulate a petition to get
on the ballot. The matter was brought
to the attention of Cary Howard, presi
dent of the league, and he at once stated
that all such talk is sheer nonsense. The
Idea probably started because of the fact
that two years ago the Municipal League
did not hold an Independent convention,
but made up a ticket of indorsements.
Those who are not Ikivorable to the league
started the story that by so doing they
lost their identity as a party and would
therefore have to start out again.
This point was decided in the case of
the general election last fall, and Is the
same in principle as the status of the
fusion ticket. The Municipal League can
didates hold large votes, and although
there is nothing of record to show how
much of the vote was the result of the
Municipal League indorsements and how
much was due to a party nomination, it
has been decided that either party must
get the credit for It.
Some doubt has been raised as to the
eligibility of Henry Menges, who has been
nominated by the Republicans for School
Director from the Sixth Ward.- The law
declares that School Directors must be
heads of families, and in Menges' regis
tration certificate, sworn to by him last
August, he says he is not the head of a
household. He Is the proprietor of a
barber shop, and has been In business here
for some years.
Councilman Brosnahan will not be a
candidate lor re-election on any party
tlcket or independently. He is chairman
0 . the Democratic committee charged
with the duty of nominating a convention
and is therefore barred from being a can
didate at his party convention. It is un
derstood that Councilman Watklnson will
be an independent candidate from the
Sixth Ward, that Henneberry will try
to be elected from the First Ward, and
that Heitman will be an independent can
date for Councilman at large.
Much interest is being shown in the ap
proaching convention to be held next
Monday and Tuesday by the Independent
Republicans and Democrats, respectively
There Is considerable doubt as to the
candidates who will be nominated It
seems to be understood that ex-Mayor
Davie will be a candidate for Mayor, though
whether he will run independently or be
indorsed at either or both of the conven
tions, is not known. Judge Fred V. Wood
may go before the Independent convention
either as candidate for Mayor of City At
torney. It is generally conceded that City
Engineer Clement will be nominated by
the Democrats. It is possible also that he
may receive the support of the Independ
ents.

WHO TAUGHT THEM
TO DRINK PUNCH?
Are San Francisco's Cotillons
Accountable fop the Oakland
Buds' Undoing?
OAKLAND has gone and done it. A scandal or so to a city's credit does
not necessarily mean that the town is lost. But a faux pas.
It is all on account of San Francisco. That is the refrain the
Oakland matrons sing. "Our little girls learned to drink punch In San
Francisco. We only serve cofd water at our affairs. San Francisco is a
bad, wicked city. We are going to pray for her on . Sunday In our
churches." i*.
So the country cousin smites the city cousin's other cheek, and all the
metropolitan hospitality is repaid with suburban Ingratitude.
If the Oakland innocent first acquired the taste for punch here who
are the guilty accountable ones? At the dancing classes such a very
weak brew is served that the patronesses in the mildest spirit of apology
always refer to It as lemonade. A bud might drink up all the "punch" at
the Fortnightly dance and nothing more serious result than the 111 feeling
of the other hot, thirsty members.
At the Cinderellas the drink is a bit stronger, but a bias, step Is only
possible at the rate of a three-gallon capacity, rather beyond the most
thirsty dancer. The only places where the Oakland belle may have had
enough beverage to render her sight weak and her step unsteady are at
the cotillons and rarely there! Over in the City of Churches
the society men have taken up the discussion of the punch sub
ject. The men are more conservative than the ladles and none has com
mitted himself otherwise than by advocating moderation. Only one Oak
land man has a word of suggestion to make and his name is T. F. Garrity.
Says the gentleman: "I believe that when a girl dances she is entitled to
some sort of stimulant. She needs it as a matter of health. By all means
give the girls the punch bowl. Don't take It away from them. But look out
what you put in it. The stimulant should be very gentle, like those to
whom it Is administered. If I had a daughter I think I should prefer that
she took her stimulant ln the shape of milk or malted milk. If that is not
to be obtained, then I should say that some other delicate, mild stimulant
is permissible, and, in fact, as I said at the outset, necessary."
FOUR HOURS
LABOR FOR
ONE MEAL
Charity Woodyard a
Failure.
\
APPLICANTS GO ON STRIKE
NEW ORDER ISSUED BY THE
MANAGEMENT. '
Relief Can Only Be Afforded if the
Public Will Patronize the
Yard of the Asso
ciation.
.Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 27.
It is somewhat unusual for men em
ployed to work for their meals to go on
strike, but such Is the situation at the
woodyard maintained by the Associated
Charities.
The situation is peculiarly unfortunate,
! for the woodyard has done a good work
i since it was established, but for lack of
patronage Its usefulness appears to be al
' most ended. This morning it was decided
â  to increase the. amount of blocks to be
] chopped for a 10-cent meal from thirty to
forty-five. When the unfortunates who
i have been glad to chop thirty blocks of
i woodâ which takes about two hoursâ
plied at the woodyard for the daily op
| portunity to satisfy hunger, they were In
; formed of the increase in the amount of
labor necessary to obtain a dime ticket
lat a restaurant. There was much dis
; appointment, some Indignation and a little
| obstinacy, and many of the men walked
off rather than work four hours for a 10
--cent meal and the same number of hours
for the privilege of sleeping in a bed at
night.
The order increasing the amount of
wood to be chopped is partly due to the
fact that over a thousand sacks of kin
dling are now In the yards, for which no
purchaser can be found, and partly to the
fact that a number of men exist who, so
long as they are able to chop enough
wood- to earn a meal and a bed, will not
seek any other means of employment.
As the woodyard was Intended only as a
temporary employment agency, this sys
tem led to the accumulation of wood, and
consequently blocked proceedings. Mrs.
Kelly, the superintendent of the charities,
says that a good deal of the patronage In
the kindling wood business is given to the
students' woodyard under the impression
that customers are thereby helping uni
versity students to go through college.
She says this Is not true and that the
students are not benefited. If the. chari
ties' woodyard . obtained a fair share of
patronage it would be able to continue its
work and not raise the amount of labor
required from each ' applicant.

Alameda Escapes a Scorching.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 27.â The Alameda fire
department was called out twice to-day.
But for the prompt action of the firemen
the business section of the city would
have been severely scorched this morning.
A gasoline stove exploded ln a house in
the rear of the Smith block, corner of
Park street and Railroad avenue, scat
tering the burning fluid in all directions.
A high north wind was blowing and for a
time the flames threatened to communi
cate with the row of frame stores on
Park street. The fire department respond
ed promptly and checked the fire before
it gained great headway. The damaged
building was occupied by Japanese, one of
whom was severely burned about the
hands by the explosion.
The second alarm turned In was for a
blaze in a dwelling at 1164 Broadway,
caused by children playing with matches.
The damage was nominal.

TRAMP INDUSTRY HAS
SUSTAINED A BAD BLOW
CONSTABLES' CLAIMS ARE CUT
DOWN THIRTY PER CENT.
Queer Methods Employed in Haling
Vagrants to and From Jail to
Make Mileage. .L ; .:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
lyr'yy 908 Broadway, Jan. 27.
The erstwhile lucrative occupation of
certain Constables in the tramp industry
has sustained a blow at the hands of
County Expert E. B. Bullock and District
Attorney J. J. Allen that will very mate
rially curtail their monthly Income, and
will probably result In the "weary Willies
of the road" enjoying their dalliance ln
the fields of vagrancy unmolested hence
forth. In short County Expert Bullock
has cut down certain , Constables' bills
very materially on the advice of District
Attorney Allen, owing to charges for
mileage that are considered illegal; and in
some cases irregularities were found, the
discovery of which will result in a big
saving to the county.
Responding to questions touching upon
the methods employed by some Con
stables Expert Bullock to-day received
the following written* opinion from the
District Attorney. '
"In reply to your queries will say that
where a Constable makes an arrest with
a warrant his fees are provided for in the
Statutes, 1895, page 272, by the following
provisions: For executing warrant of ar
rest, $1; for each mile necessarily traveled
within his county In executing a warrant
of arrest, both In going and returning
from place of arrest, 15 cents.
"If an arrest is made without a warrant
the following provisions of the act apply:
For arresting and bringing him into court
$1; for transporting prisoners to the Coun
ty Jail, the actual cost of such transpor
tation." a *iKt"Tifl!rTr > ffTT^
Under the foregoing opinion County Ex
pert Bullock has , cut down some bills
rom 25 to 30 per cent, those filed by Con
stable C.F. Weldon. of Brooklyn Town
ship being the most noticeable. > Weldon,
who. by the way, has not been re-elected,
appears to have been doing a land-offlco
business in the tramp line, for his opera
tions were about equally divided between
Justice Qulnn's court at San Leandro and
Justice Cliffs court in Oakland Township.
A tramp arrested in Brooklyn- would first
be taken to the . County Jail and register
ed, for which mileage was charged. 0 The
arrest would be : without a -warrant, of
course, for the name of the tramp is a
secondary matter with the eager Con
stables. The next day the prisoner would
be, taken before Justice Qulnn at San
Leandro, more mileage accruing, to en
able the Constable to swear to a com
plaint and secure a warrant. In many
cases this warrant would be served on
the prisoner in court, the simple walk
around a table in the courtroom constitut
ing a fraction of a mile, which is taken as
a whole mile. I The prisoner's arraignment
would necessitate another haling from
jail to court, and then In many cases the
charge would be dismissed.
In paring down some of Weldon's claims
Expert Bullock reduced one filed last
August, from $52 to $36 20; one in Septem
ber was cut from $36 to $29; another in the
same month from $36 40 to $25 50; an Octo
ber claim of $15 was pared down $4; an

BURIED WITHOUT A
FRIEND TO MOURN
MISS RICH'S ESTATE WAS JUST
ONE DIME.
Her Animals Carted to the Pound and
Her Late House Declared a
Nuisance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 27.
The poundman took two wagon-loads of
dogs, cats and goats from the dirty house
in Temescal ln which Miss E. C. Rich
lived and died. The house is unspeakably
filthy, and was invaded by Public Ad
ministrator Hawes and Officer McKinley.
The Administrator found little estate ex
cept some old clothes that indicated the
woman had once been tolerably well
dressed. In a trunk there was a com
plete set of baby clothes, which probably
suggests a secret that died with the old
maid. This afternoon the remains of the
eccentric woman were Interred at the ex
pense of the county, as all her miserable
belongings are worth nothing.
One dime was found by Mr. Hawes
among the rubbish, and a worthless horse
was given to a neighbor to save it from
going to the pound. ' Many of the dogs
escaped, and as the goats were valueless
the neighbors have been permitted to take
them. The house will probably be de
clared a nuisance by the Board of Health
until the owner shall appear and have it
cleansed. .->;"-:
THE STOCK MARKET.
There was a long line of securities dealt in

WEBSTER SLIPS
A JOKER PAST
THE DIRECTORS
Secret of the Plot by Which the
Commercial Departments of
the Mission High School
Were Abolished.
Members of the Board of Education Will
Do All in Their Power to Reconsider
the Vote of Abolition â Stow's
Part in the Scheme â Indig
nant Citizens.
Public school affairs are engrossing
general attention. The department is nec
essarily in a state of confusion and
will remain so until the work of consoli
dation by the Board of Education is fin
ished. When the list of teachers who
have been removed or suspended has
been published and the host of vice
principals have been degraded, - the de
partment will again be in an orderly con-
dition. Protests will then be taken to the
courts, and the dismissed teachers will oe
compelled to fight their way legally back
into the schools.
- There is now absolutely no question tnat
the revolutionary measures of the board
are prompted In some instances by petty
politics and In others for the advantage
of certain favorites who have, for the
time, the ear of those in power. Certain
members of the board accuse Superintend
ent of Schools Webster of subserving
private, selfish schemes under the mask
of proposing public reforms. The scheme
of Webster, Stow and Bush to juggle
Mrs. S. W. McPherson out of her position
has already been exposed. The Superin
tendent and his associates fortunately did
not succeed In this affair and exposure
has made any further effort futile.
The Superintendent, Director Vander
lyn Stow and Principal Walter N. Bush
are now accused, however, of having en
gineered to success another job at the
meeting last Wednesday night. This ac
cusation is made by several members of
the board, and interesting developments
may be expected. The job to which ref
erence is made was the abolition of the
business and commercial departments of
the Mission High School. It is claimed
that the resolution abolishing these de
partments was sneaked through the board
on Wednesday night under unquestionably
false representations. If it is possible to
do so the matter, which is agitating the
people of the Mission, will be reconsidered
at the meeting of the board next Monday
night.
The history of this affair is timely and
of public importance. The direction of the
affairs of special departmentsâ High
Schools and Normal Schoolsâ ls left to the
committee on secondary education. The
abolition of the Normal School, the modi
fication of the course of study in the Mis
sion High School and the dismissal of
special teachers, indicate sufficiently the
great importance of the Committee on
Secondary Education. Vanderlyn Stow is
â¢ chairman of this committee. For some
reason not very clearly explained Director
Stow has delegated his powers as chair
man of the Committee on Secondary Edu
cation to Superintendent Webster.
When the Board of Education met last
"Wednesday night Director Stow had no
report of the Committee on Secondary
Education to submit. As a matter of fact
Director Stow had not taken the trouble
to call a meeting of that committee,
which should have thoroughly discussed
the revolutionary changes proposed for
the Mission High School. Superintendent
Webster placed in his report, however,
a resolution of most peculiar and signifi
cant wording. This resolution provided
that the Mission High School shall have
the same course of study as the Lowell
High School.
Nothing was said directly about the ex
istence of the commercial departments of
the Mission High School and It was not
necessary to say anything. The joker of
abolition was hidden by the Superintendent
ln his pack of apparently innocent words.
Several Directors voted for the resolution
under a false impression and they wish
â  now to reconsider their action. They be
lieved that the standard of the schools
â was to be made Identical and that noth
ing else was Intended. They are natural
ly indignant and will, if possible, remedy
the evil accomplished by the Superintend
ent's resolution.
Director E. L. Head is one of the Di
rectors who declare that they voted for
the resolution under the false Impression
created by the Superintendent. "I never
would have voted for the resolution," said
Director Head yesterday, "if I had known
its true import. I did not know that we
â¢were legislating the commercial depart
ments of the Mission High School out of
the department and were depriving a class
of over 100 students of the right to In
struction. I was explicitly told that the
resolution was intended simply to make
' the course of study in the Lowell High
School and the Mission High School uni
form. I am heartily in favor now of re
considering the resolution."
It is perhaps interesting to know in con
nection with this affair of which the Di
rector speaks that Walter N. Bush, a
cousin of Superintendent Webster, is prin
cipal of the Polytechnic High School. The
abolition of the commercial department
of the Mission High School would mean
the strengthening of the Polytechnic
. School.
A great deal of Interest was caused yes
terday by the announcement* that the
special department of physical culture
had been abolished in the schools. This Is
a mistake, caused in the confusion of the
board's action on Wednesday night.
Physical culture will be retained in the
department under the direction of the
present Instructors. The department is
â  considered to be one of the most essential
in the public schools.
Teachers whose classes were lost in the
great shuffle of last Wednesday night and
' pupils whose teachers have passed from
the payrolls are waiting ln the ante-room
cf the School Superintendent. Heading
the line of complainants Is Principal
O'Connor of the Mission High School, who
finds himself without his commercial
class, numbering about eighty pupils.
O'Connor alleges that this measure is the
result of the Superintendent's partiality
toward Principal Bush of the Polytechnic
' High School, which will probably catch
the Mission institution's late commercial
department. Bush has always been Jeal
ous of the ' Mission High School, says
O'Connor, and wants to deplete Its enroll
ment. Superintendent Webster is a rela
tive of Bush, and blood is thicker than the
board's economical policy, continues the
Irate O'Connor.
Mr. Webster, when asked for informa
tion on the subject, stated that he did not
wish to discuss the Mission School prin
cipal or his complaint. He, however, stat
ed that those classes were abolished be
- cause of the desire of the board to con
dense in some measure the business por
tion of the School Department. The
classes have become scattered all over the
city said the Superintendent. This is a
part of the scheme to get some regularity
into the educational department of the
' city
" "Notwithstanding Mr. O'Connor's pub
lications I have the best of feeling for the
1 Mission High School, and' I want to see
i It side by side In academic equality with
the Lowell School. Therefore the book
keeping and the commercial law classes
were eliminated. The Board of Educa
tion wishes that school to be what it
should be, to wit. an academy, and that
is all there is to the story. Professor L.
A. Jordan, the head of the science depart
ment of tho Polytechnic, .was granted
three months' leave of absence from that
Institution and will act as. a deputy in
this office during the rush of work In rev
olutionizing the School Department. He
was chosen because of his fitness for this
work. Only because of that and nothing
more."
The legality of the diplomas of the pres
ent normal class Is another irritating
question. The opinion has been advanced
that after this month the city normal will
be a private school, supported by the pri
vate contributions of the pupils. Will the
diplomas of the graduates be accepted
by the City School Department as teach
ers'certificates? If the two normal teach
ers are employed by the pupils of that
school between the dates of February 1
and June 30, 1899, will they lose their
standing as paid teachers of the depart
ment? is another vexing query. However,
Miss Fowler and Mrs. Fitzgerald may ob
tain a five months' leave of absence with
out, Pay and teach in their old positions.
The stenographic class of the Business
Evening School on Bush street, near
Stockton, are up ln arms protesting
against the proposed dismissal of their
teacher, H. A. Byrnes. They claim that
he Is a practical stenographer, and under
his instruction they have made rapid ad
vancement. The proposition to put an
other teacher, Miss O'Mally, in his place
has stirred them up and they threaten to
leave the school in a body. A committee
of the class will visit Superintendent Web
ster with their protest to-day.
It was stated in the report of the Wed
nesday night meeting that the board had
withdrawn its appeal in the Klrkpatrick
case. Such is not the case, as the ques
tion was argued in the committee meeting
of the board and it was decided to let the
case go ahead.
It has been decided that three High
School classes will be abolished. One of
these will be closed ln the boys' and two !
in the girls' school. There is one teacher
on record who does not complain. This
philosophical educator is M. Doyle, draw
ing teacher of the Lincoln School. He i
says It is all right, even If he does lose i
his position, and believes in the greatest
good for the greatest number.
Director Armstrong of the Building and '
Grounds Committee, has submitted a 30
--page report on the dilapidated school
houses in the city. He says the buildings
and yards are in a miserable condition.
Roofs are leaking, walls are shedding '
plaster and the plumbing is unhealthy.
He states that It Is Imperative on the
part of the board to have repairs made
on the school property, that It may be
fitted for occupancy.
After being deprived, of their salaries
for three months, the teachers in the
public schools have become desperate,
and yesterday their attorneys, Garber,
Creswell & Garber and Olney & Olnev,
went before Judge Seawell and asked
that the court modify the injunction here
tofore Issued at the instance of Oscar
Moses, on behalf of the merchants and
other creditors of the School Depart
ment, and allow them to draw their
salaries for the month of January. They
did not ask that the salaries due them
for the months of November and De
cember be paid, but nevertheless the peti
tion to modify the injunction met with
opposition at the hands of Attorneys
Powers. Cushing and Robeson, who are
retained by the merchants and other
creditors to prosecute their claims.
On behalf of the teachers It was claimed
that' the teachers' demands are preferred
claims, and that they were suffering great
Injury by reason of the injunction. It
was contended on behalf of the mer
chants, however, that there Is still in the
treasury to the credit of the School De
partment, the contention being supported
by affidavit, the sum of $248,717 67. which
is not even sufficient to pay the demands
of the teachers, and aver that in the
event this amount is paid out the law
will prevent them from recovering after
another appropriation has been made, as
all obligations arising out of contracts
must be paid out of the funds of the
fiscal year in which the contracts were
entered Into. The contention that the
teachers stand in the light of. preferred
creditors Is resisted by the merchants'
attorneys, and they quote from a recent
decision: ';.-_â ;'; -.â â¢ s v:
"Salaries are not liabilities against the
treasury which rest upon any authoriza
tion or contract by the Board of Super
visors or any other officer. They are
fixed by law. and are not subject to the
control of such officers. They are payable
out of the general fund, and are not
limited to any particular part of that
fund which the board may choose to set
apart for their payment."
â¢ The argument on the various Intricate
questions of law arising occupied the en
tire day, and the case was then sub
mitted. A decision will be handed down
ln a few days. .â¢:/" ;-,
A mass-meeting under. the auspices of
the Mission High School Society was held
last evening in Native Sons* Hall. Seven
teenth and Valencia streets, for the pur
pose of protesting against the action of
the Board of Education in closing the
commercial 'classes in that school. "Dr.
C. A. Clinton presided over the gathering,
which was composed of many of the most
prominent citizens of the Mission district.
A resolution was adopted asking the
board to reconsider its action in the mat
ter of the abolition of the business depart
ment of the High .School and that a com
mittee from the society be granted a hear
ing at the next meeting of the board,
which will take place next Monday even
ing. ';':â -..;-:
Notice was given by Dr. C. A. Clinton
that the executive committee of the Mis
sion High School Society would meet in
Native Sons' Hall this afternoon at 2
o'clock, and also at 822 Guerrero street in
the evening. The committee will attend
the Board of Education meeting Monday
night. ' '
There Was No Foul Play.
Coroner Hill yesterday examined Into
the case of Mrs. E. J. Tyrrell, who died at
her home, B2B*_ Alabama street, last
"Wednesday. Mrs. Tyrrell had been ailing
for a long while. Wednesday she acci
dentally fell downstairs and sustained a
contusion of the head. Dr. Born was
called in and found her suffering from
pneumonia. She died a few hours later
and he signed a certificate to the effect
that death was due to pneumonia. Yes
terday Coroner Hill received a letter from
Minnie McDermott, a cousin of the de
ceased, who claimed that Mrs. Tyrrell
never had pneumonia and " she thought'
the case should be Investigated. The Cor
oner and Dr. Zabala accordingly per
formed an autopsy yesterday and found
that the woman had been suffering from
pneumonia in both lungs.

EDWARD I. SHEEHAN, Tax Collector. '.
The constitutional ' enactment, upon
which the Tax Collector bases his claim
that the charter Is already in force,
Any city containing a population of mora
than three thousand five hundred inhabi
tants may form a charter for Its own gov- â 
ernment, consistent with and subject to tha
constitution and laws of this State,, by
causing a board of fifteen freeholders, who ;
shall have been for at least five years quali
fied electors thereof, to be elected by the
qualified voters of said city at any general
or special election, whose duty It shall be
within ninety days after such election : to
prepare and -propose a charter for such
city. â¢ â¢- * It shall be submitted to
the qualified electors of said city at a gen
eral or special election, and If a majority
of such qualified electors voting: thereat
shall ratify the same, It shall thereafter be
submitted to the .Legislature for Its ap-
â  proval or rejection as a whole, . without .
power of alteration or amendment.
Such approval may be made by concurrent
resolution, and If approved by a majority
vote of the members elected to each house,
IT SHALL, BECOME THE CHARTER OF
SUCH CITY, or If such city be consolidated
with a county, then of such city â¢ and
county, and shall become the organic law
thereof, and all laws Inconsistent with such
charter are thereby repealed.
Mayor Phelan said, when asked for his
interpretation of the matter: "The char
ter approved by the Legislature was. the
charter of the Freeholders. It expressly
states that It goes Into effect on January
1 next. The Legislature by approving
the charter submitted to it fixed the date.
Any contention otherwise will not hold."
The clause in the charter fixing the date
reads in . part as follows: â¢/, / .... - v

; prove the same it shall' take effect and he

OWNERS CANNOT RAISE RENT
TO FORCE A TENANT TO MOVE
JUSTICE GROEZINGER '.decided: a case yesterday which is destined to i at
tract â â  widespread attention among property , owners, real \\ estate agents
and rent collectors. It is, in effect that an owner cannot increase the \ rent
of a piece of property to /an/exorbitant 'amount* merely to - terminate : a
tenancy and obtain , possession of the property: ( .He , must resort to . the ' legal
remedy, which is that one month's notice-must^ be -given, the tenant.- This
'does not prevent a landlord from increasing' a tenant's "rent .where he is en
titled to a larger return .on -the money he has invested!" The decision was ren
dered. in the case of Ellen Connolly 'agairret-LilyâWaterbTify.*-â The original
rent of the premises -in dispute at 724 Laguna Â£ street' was '$10 ' and was in
creased to $25. * . â¢ ' .':â¢';'.;'. y ', â .','â â¢ V ,' ' 'â â ' { Vâ ' . ' : V .V-'- V. \ /â¢"/.'' ' . .-' .<â .'.*.- ..-.'
The agent for the' landlord testified that the "only reason for increasing
the rent was for .the- purpose of obtaining -possession; Justice Groezinger
decided that the notice was not made in good faith. He held that If a landlord
wants to terminate, a tenant's .. .ease- for the purpose of -obtaining possession
he must give one month's notice prior to the beginning of the new month,
and not resort to the- subterfuge of crowding out a tenant ,by a* fifteen days'
notice, Increasing/ his rent to an outrageous 5um. ...... VV .', V- _ â¢ --,'â 
In the past It has. been the general custom of rent collectors and landlords,
in order jto obtain possession of 'â  property, .to â¢ increase the | rent \tor a | prohibi
tive sum,', thereby frightening the 1 , tenant into surrendering or suffer a judg
ment: for treble the 'amount; of the exorbitant- /"-rent.'' Justice Gr'oezinger
holds that the spirit and: intention-; of the law-makers in' authorizing a land
lord to change a monthly; lease by ; Increasing rent was i. not ; for the â¢ purpose
of effecting a termination of a .tenancy,; thereby securing possession .of the
property, but 'merely for the purpose of .changing the terms of 'a*- lease- in
good faith'- where the j return is < inadequate to the rental"' value of ' the â¢ prop
erty. 2 ..{' ,"\r "â 'â :â ' ....'....'. '..â¢'# .'â ,'._;. :'â , ..._....'.- '-"

The Finance Committee referred the
matter to the City and County Attorney

the charter takes effect and its provisions

SHIPWRIGHTS
AT OUTS WITH
SHIPBUILDERS
Having Trouble With
Hay & Wright.
.
ALL A QUESTION OF' WAGES
"AN ADDRESS TO SHIPOWNERS"
OUT ON THE SUBJECT.
Reward of $50 Each Offered for the
Bodies of William Seabury and t
E. J. Finn, the Missing
Duck Hunters.
The Journeymen Shipwrights' -Associa
tion and. the shipbuilding firm of Hay &
Wright are at outs. The trouble has been
brewing for a long time, -but the fat is
now in the fire and the shipwrights . are
going to fight the firm to the bitter end.
It is all a question of wagesâ of course,
the matter of union and non-union men
comes in, but the wage proposition is the
principal stumbling block. The â¢ ship
wrights charge that Hay & Wright pose
as a union shop, but pay "scab" wages,
in "An address to ship owners" they state
that members of their own union swore
that they, got $5 a day from the firm,
when for over a year, their pay was only
$3 and $4 a day. "And," says -the ship
wrights in , their address, . "all the time
that this state of affairs existed the ship
wright firm of Hay & Wright- was run
under false pretenses as a union yard, run
under union principles, by bunion men at
union wages."
After citing a number of instances bear- i
ing on the firm's methods of dealing with
the men, the shipwrights close their "ad
dress to ship owners" as follows:
Now, gentlemen, the Shipwrights' Association
of San Francisco is one of the oldest landmarks
on the city front. It has been in existence for
over forty years, and with two exceptions
every boss shipwright in San Francisco and
very many on the coast graduated from its
ranks, including Messrs. Hay and Wright, who
were among its most steadfast . and etanchest
members for years and the greatest advocates
of its principles, rules and wages. Mr. Wright
was a member for close to thirty years, -and
during all that time he never missed an oppor
tunity of advocating . the maintenance of the
highest standard of wages. When our associa
tion adopted a standard it .thought was fair
and honestâ and that standard Is maintained
to the, present dayâ Mr. Wright was not sat
isfied. He took advantage of every opportunity
offered and demanded more pay, more than the
established rules that our association called
for, and got. more pay In many cases.
, A few weeks ago the few shipwrights that
were decoyed ; out of our association told him
that they were disgusted with the way he
was destroying their trade, and If he did not
change his methods they would come back Into
the union. Mr. Wright told the men that he had
been working with almost all his lifeâ the men
to whom he had been holding up the great ad
vantages of the ' association, its rules and Its
wagesâ men whose trade he is now seeking
to destroy, depriving, them of their only means
of making a livingâ he told those men that, if
they went back Into the association he would
go deeper Into the valley and get more tramps.
The members of our association are well
known to the ship owners of San Francisco as
a sober, Industrious, â¢ hard-working class -of
first-class mechanics and respectable " citizens
and many of them are the personal friends
and associates of captains and owners of ves
sels and have been for â  years, and quite â ' a
number of our, members in years gone by
when 'the ..work at our trade was good and
they were able to save ' some money, without
the slightest hesitation, bought interests, ln the
vessels.; of -the ship owners of -San -Francisco
and are associated with them : in business â¢at
the â  present time; but of | late I years the â¢ work
at our trade has been. very dull, and a large
majority of our members would 'consider, them
selves very fortunate if they could make -half
time all the year around: and when-consider
ing that they are compelled "to have, â¢at all
times, about $200 worth of tools, > which we are
constantly losing, breaking, and, we are sorry
to say, in. many cases they are stolen from usâ
when- you come to consider those - things ' you
will readily see that it . requires the â¢ greatest
economy on the part of our members to be able
to support their -families. . r. ; .
I .With this I address â¢ the shipwrights I are
going .to every ship owner i in San. Fran
cisco to try to persuade them to give their
work ito any other - firm i but Hay &
Wright.

about our .business ! as we 'do ourselves,"
said-he.- "In- fact- they think they could

than we can. | Now, I think we know our

MRS. STANFORD AND
THE CENTRAL PACIFIC
A RUMOR REVIVED THAT SHE
WILL UNLOAD HER STOCK.
She Left Last Evening for New York.
Her Arrival Awaited With
Interest.
Railroad people and stock speculators
are on I the anxious seat' regarding the
Central Pacific. The departure of Vice
President Crocker for the East, followed
by the announcement yesterday that Mrs.
Leland j Stanford would leave last even
ing for New York, revived the rumor the
Stanford block of Central Pacific stock
was to be unloaded at once. The sudden
and mysterious rise in Central Pacific,
which increased Mrs. Stanford's fortune
by several figures, has been a constant
topic for discussion and' prophecy among
railroad men for several week.".
' Before Vice President Crocker departed
he held a. long conference with Mrs. Stan
ford, and as their interests , are closely
allied. It Is expected something mo
mentous, will ' happen when they reach
New York. Mrs. Stanford's energies are,
as is well known, all devoted to per
petuating Stanford "University, and she is
endeavoring to so arrange the property
which is to go to the Institution that the
trustees will have comparatively little
trouble in managing it. Instead of leav
ing an Immense fortune in unstable and
fluctuating railroad stocks, the income
from which would always be uncertain,
it is her evident, Intention to convert the
stocks Into cash or gilt-edged interest
bearing bonds. For these reasons it Is
now believed she will dispose of her en
tire holdings in Central Pacific.
Mrs. : Stanford left for tne East last
evening. Her friends knew of her de
parture, but she did not disclose the pur
pose of her trip nor how long she would
be gone. â¢ -'._.._

Match Race of 100 Birds at

Coleman was defeated by Sloan In their

Sloan's kindness of heart asserted Itself
and he consented on Friday last to give
his unsuccessful competitor another
chance to redeem himself.
Last evening Tod and Johnny met at
the rooms of the Olympic Gun Club and
deposited with Secretary Scovern the sum
of $250 a side, subject to j the following
conditions, viz.: The race to take place
at the Olympic Gun Club's trap shooting
grounds near Ingleslde on Sunday morn
ing at 10 o'clock; . Hurllngham rules
to govern. Each man to shoot at 100 live
birds (blue rocks), and the one who
scores the greater number of kills to be
declared the champion trap shooter of
the turf and the winner of the coin at
stake. Stanley Scovern has been selected
trapper and official scorer. Betting on
the contest has commenced. The racing
friends of both men are looking forward
to a forenoon of great sport. Coleman Is
a slight favorite in the betting, from the
fact that he is considered a great stayer
and a very cool performer. Still, Sloan
Is confident of winning, and he will have
several admirers on the grounds who will"
back him liberally A against the book
maker.
Tod will use a beautiful twelve-gauge
gun, which is a present from the Prince
