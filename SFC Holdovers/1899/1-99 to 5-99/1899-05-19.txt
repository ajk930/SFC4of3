THE HAGUE, May is.â peace
conference called by the Czar of
Russia was opened at 2 o'clock
this afternoon in the Hall of the
Huis Ten Bosch, or -The House
in the Woods," two miles from The
Hague.
M. de Beaufort. President of the
Council. Minister of Foreign Affairs of
the Government of The Netherlands.
delivered the inaugural address and
welcomed the delegates. M. de Beau
fort spoke of the high honor of the
choice of The Hague as the' meeting
place 'for the conference, and extolled
the noble initiative of the Czar, sav
ing this would be a red letter day in
the history of the century and express
ing the hope that his Majesty would
be able to look back at the day as the
most glorious of his life. He concluded
with calling attention to the allegorical
group over the doorway of the hall.
Peace entering to close the temple of
Janus, and said:
I trust this beautiful allegory will be an
nugury of your labors and that after you
have completed them yon will be able to
say that peace, whom art introduced into
the hall, left it to spread its blessings
among the whole of humanity.
The delegates decided to send the fo]
lowing telegram to the Czar:
The Peace Conference lays at the feet
of your Majesty its respectful congratu
lations upon the occasion of your birth
day and expresses its sincere desire to
co-operate In the great and noble work
in which your Majesty has taken a gen
erous initiative and for which it begs you

M. de Staal, the Russian Embassa
dor to Great Britain and head of the
Russian delegation, in formally assum
ing the presidency of the conference.
said his first duty was to express to
M. de Beaufort his sincere gratitude
for the noble terms in which he had
referred to his august Majesty, the
Czar, adding that his Majesty would
be deeply touched, as well by the spon
taneity with which the High Assembly
had associated itself therewith. Con
tinuing M. de Staal said: I
Though to the Czar is due the initiative
of the conference, we owe much to the
Queen of the Netherlands for Inviting us
to her capital. It is a happy augury of
success that we have met under the aus
pices of the young sovereign whose
charge Is felt in a wide circle, whose
heart Is open to everything great and
generous and who has displayed such
sympathy with the cause which brings
us here. It is on the historic soil of the
Netherlands that the greatest â¢ political
problems have been discussed. Here Is
the cradle of science and international
law.
After a reference to the historic peace
treaties concluded at The Hague, and
expressing regret that M. de Beaufort
had not accepted the presidency of the
conference', M. .de Staal said in con
clusion:
I cannot consider my election otherwise
than inspired by. my. position as plenipo
tentiary, of the empire of the sovereign
who was the initiator of the conference.

ARE SPOKEN
FOR THE CZAR

De Staal Is Chosen
as President.
On this ground I accept with deep grat
itude the distinguished honor and 1 shall

a weak auxiliary, but I hope that it will
at least constitute a claim upon your In
dulgence.
After making his address: M. de
Staal in behalf of the conference tele
graphed to the Queen of The Nether
lands as follows:
The members of this conference, assem
bled for the first time in this beautiful
Hula Ten Bosch, hasten to lay at the feet
of your Majesty their besPHtishes. prat

and the leading Dutch delegate. A. P.
C. Van Karnobeck, former Minister of
Foreign Affairs and Deputy, was ap
pointed vice president.
After the appointment of nine sec
retaries, M. de Staal's proposal that
the sessions be secret was adopted. The
next session will take place on Satur
day, when the delegates will arrange a
programme and appoint committees.
The conference then adjourned.
The session to-day only occupied
twenty-five minutes, and the apparent
unanimity displayed was. considered to

SMALLPOX ALONG
NORTHERN RAILROADS
Laborers at the Cascade Tunnel Af-
flicted Through Germs Brought
by Imported . Japs.
TACOMA, Wash., May is.â Smallpox
has broken out at Cascade Tunnel, on the
Great Northern Railway, and at Stam
pede, on the Northern Pacific Railroad.
It Is supposed that the disease was car
ried from one tunnel to another by work
men. The strangest thing about its ap
pearance Is the difficulty of tracing Its
source. There has been no smallpox In
this State for a long time, and the only
plausible explanation yet made is that
smallpox germs were brought from Asia
by-Japanese laborers arriving within the
last few weeks, who have since gone to
work for the railroads named at and near
their tunnels through the Cascade Moun
tains. Several people at each tunnel, have
the disease and prompt measures are
being taken to stamp It out. Railroad
physicians are vaccinating the railroad
employes, though some of the latter have
refused to be vaccinated and started east
ward. A hired girl, who waited at table
at the Stampede section-house worked
for a number of days after her face was
broken out before it was learned she had
smallpox. It is feared a large number
have caught the disease in this manner.
Secretary Nelson of the State Board of
Health Is Investigating the outbreak and
will take rigorous action against railroad
employes bound eastward from the two
Cascade tunnels. It Is seven years since
Seattle and Tacoma had an epidemic of
smallpox,, and strenuous efforts will be
made to prevent another. ;â  r. . :

TO HONOR DEWEY
Suggestion to Erect a Statue in This City Con)-

With Spontaneous Approval.

O _____ . O

o San Francisco is under exceptional obligations, therefore, to Dewey, and _

Â° I will act on the suggestion to appoint a committee, to-morrow, and will Â°

OOOOOOOOOOOOGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO"'00000000000
SAN FRANCISCO will have a
statue of Dewey that will be
at once the pride of the whole
Pacific Coast and a lasting monu
ment to his matchless victory.
The suggestion, barely twenty-four
hours old, has received the indorsement
of citizens in every walk of life with
out exception, for not one voice has
been raised In objection, while every-
body who has mentioned the matter
has given it his unqualified approval.
Mayor James D. Phelan has already
taken hold of the patriotic plan with
characteristic energy. He will appoint
a committee of citizens to-day to take
charge of the project. The Mayor is !
enthusiastic and says the committee
must be composed of men who will
work with unflagging energy until the
statue of the hero of Manila is uncov
ered to the admiring gaze of the peo
ple. Professional men of all branches,
public officials, merchants and business
men without exception approve of it
and declare it is entirely feasible.
Substantial offers of money to aid the
plan have already been made, and this
without solicitation and with scarcely
a moment's consideration.
In fact there has never been a pub-
lie movement set on foot in this city
that has met with such spontaneous
and universal approval as has the pro
posed statue to Admiral Dewey.
Yesterday men heard it broached for
the first time, and instantly gave it
their strongest indorsement. Then,
after a brief reflection, would come the
query: .-
"Where shall we place it?"
It. was not "Where would â¢_ it be
placed?*.' but* simply | "Where shall we
place it?" as though there could be no
possible doubt but that "we" shall have
the statue to place. In almost every In
stance the question was instantly suc
ceeded by the answer from the ques
tioner himself:
"Golden Gate Park."
San Francisco's great resort was al
| most invariably selected as proper
location, although the suggestion was.
' made by one or two that the gore at
the intersection of Market, Drumm and
California streets might be a proper
I site, for there the statue would be seen
i by every person entering the city by
land or by sea. Another suggestion
was that the statue be placed on the
highest pinnacle on the peninsula,
where It would be seen from all parts
of the city and from the sea as well.
Those who named Golden Gate Park
as the site were divided in opinion as
to what part of the big playground
would be the best place for the statue.
Some thought the entrance to the pan
handle when it is extended to Van Ness
avenue and Market street would be. the
proper place for It, as it would be al
most In the heart of the city and in
view of the greatest number of people
at all times: others would erect it on
some high point overlooking the sea in
plain sight of every ship passing
through the Golden Gate, symbolic of
the city. State and coast's gratitude to
j the man who, at a blow, cleared the
! Pacific of a fleet that menaced these
| shores. The site of the three flag poles
was also looked upon as an ideal spot
to commemorate Dewey's achievement.
Of course, the site is really an after
consideration, but Its discussion, almost
with the breath that gave the first in
dorsement of the statue itself, was a
happy omen of success. The question
of finances was not once raised; there
was no thought given to the probable
cost, whatever it might be; one and all
accepted it as merely a matter of de
tail that would be no bar to the com
pletion of the project. '""_**
There was one other matter that re
ceived some attention by the enthusi
astic citizens besides the location, and
that was the statue itself. The central

sides that of Dewey, an allegorical
group representing the soldiers and
sailors California has given to the com
mon defense of the country might be
shown, together with the prow of the
Olympla. . . . ;
All this shows the marked enthusi
asm that greeted the first suggestion
of the project. This enthusiasm is cer
tain to grow until by erecting this
tribute to his gallant services, San
Francisco has given substantial proof
of her patriotism and her gratitude to
the man who safeguarded her com
merce and her homes. Â«
Following are expressions by some of
the leading men who were seen yester
day indorsing the movement:
Irving M. Scott â
I am heartily in favor of the move-
ment to erect a monument to Admiral
Dewey. He deserves all the honors
the Pacific Coast can bestow on him,
as his action in destroying the Span-
ish fleet saved this coast from attack.
We are therefore under deep obliga
tions to him, and I hope the efforts
of The Call in that direction will be
crowned with success. I believe an
appropriate monument should be
erected at the most conspicuous point â 
in the proposed extension of the park
panhandle. It should be placed on a
summit, so that we all could see It,
and so that the passengers on Incom-
ing ships might also view it.
E. A. Denicke â
What Admiral Dewey has done was
done for posterity more than for the
present generation. So the acknowl
edgment should be for posterity. It
should take the shape of a monument
which ought to be a j grand work of
art. In my opinion, it is more in keep-
ing than the scheme to purchase him
a home. A monument is the only
proper recognition, and we should
erect them :to those who are alive as
an ; encouragement to others, because
it excites emulation. I think It Is a
much nobler way of showing a peo- j
ple's gratitude' than by subscribing
capital for the purchase of a house
and lot. I therefore would like to see \
a ; monument erected to Admiral
Dewey in Golden Gate Park and
heartily Indorse the move to bring It
about. _ "'. ' '.'".,_
Rev. Father Otis â .
Admiral Dewey is entitled to reward
j - and recognition for the gallant serv
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
ices he has rendered the United States
during the past year In the Orient. Âc
will be rewarded partially by the pro
posed mansion for which subscrip
tions are being received from all parts
of the country. A statue to be erected
in Golden Gate Park would be a
graceful recognition of Admiral
Dewey's worth as a man. He may
visit this city at some future time, and
if he could then be shown some sculp
ture commemorating his deeds at Ma
nila he would know he was appreciat
ed. Let it be a credit alike to this muni
cipality and to the man who Is to be
honored.
garret W. McEnerneyâ
I am heartily in favor of the project.
It will be a fitting tribute to Admiral
Dewey, of which the people of the en
tire coast can be justly proud. We
should all be eager to assist any move
ment which has for its end the hon
oring of this great man. The people of
this city are, as a rule, awakened to
prompt action when propositions of
this nature are set on foot. Golden
Gate Park will be incomplete until
graced with a monument erected 'in
honor of George Dewey.
Judge J. H. Seawell â
It is a grand idea. No honor is too
great for this man. Dewey is entitled
to all the respect and honor which thii
community can bestow upon him. If
a monument was erected in his honot
in Golden Gate Park it would be one
of the features of the park, besides be
ing a just tribute to Admiral Dewey's
greatness. His victory over the Span
ish fleet in the Bay of Manila is the
greatest naval achievement in the
world's history. The people of this
coast are keenly interested in his wel
fare, and I feel that this suggestion
has touched a cord in their nature that
will bring a prompt response. Let ua
build a monument for Dewey.
Supervisor E. L. Perrault â
Build a monument by all means that
shall stand for all time as a token of
the esteem in which we Western peo
ple hold Admiral Dewey. He has done
his work weh and now that he has
decided to take a much-needed rest
let our labors in his behalf begin. He
has spent his years in the service of
our Government and crowned his ca
reer with perhaps the most brilliant
achievement ever/noted in civilized
warfare, and now we should show him
that every heart in this great State
holds a warm spot for him. A Dewey
monument In Golden Gate Park would
be a fitting tribute to this great hero.
Judge Frank H. Dunne â
Judge Frank H. Dunne â
The erection of a Dewey monument
In Golden Gate Park is -a project that
should, and I think undoubtedly will,
meet with the approbation and hearty
co-operation of every, public-spirited
citizen on the Pacific Coast. No honor
is too great for George Dewey. Of all2
the heroes of the war George Dewey
la the most renowned. Were it dot for
him our entire coast might now be one
great waste, for had he not sent death
and destruction sweeping over the
Spanish fleet It would have been free
to steam across the Pacific to our
shores to prey upon our commerce and
perhaps destroy our homes. .
Judge William P. Lawlorâ
In no way could the service Admiral
Dewey has rendered the Pacific coast
be more appropriately commemorated
than by a heroic statue of the great-
si naval hero of the age. It devolves
upon San Francisco, the metropolis
of the Western slope, to see that this
statue Is re. ted, and at once. The
plan must not be permitted to lag for
an instant. There can be but one site
for such a figure, and that is upon
some height overlooking the Golden
Gate, an enduring reminder to our
people of the debt of gratitude we
owi liini for the protection he afford-
ed our interests.
Rev. R. C. Fouteâ
Grace Episcopal Churchâ The ques
tion of commemorating the naval vie-
tories of Admiral Dewey cannot be
debated, as there is only one side to
it. A testimonial is due him more
than any man- of the century. The
people throughout the Pacific coast
will undoubtedly accord their hearty
support to the movement having for
its object the placing of a statue in
Gold-Mi Gate Park in honor of Dewey.
It was on the distant shores of the
Pacific Ocean he scored the victory
which has made his name Immortal.
A statue of the naval hero would be
a ting manner in which to perpetu-
ate both his name and us deeds.
Jerome Deasy â
Supervisor â By all means erect
a statue in honor of Admiral Dewey
In Golden Gate Park. He is espe
cially deserving of recognition at
the hands of the people of this coast,
as he was the _< fender of its shores
during the trying times of the war. a.-
though many leagues away The me-
morial should be artistic and substan
tial, qualities not possessed by s^jme
place in the people's pleasure groun"rt.
Dewey is to-day the foremost Ameri-
can and the idol of the people. It is
but proper that some action be taken
to show our appreciation of the work
he has done is an â¢officer and as a
diplomat. The movement to honor
him should be a popular, one, partic
ipated in by all. sorts and conditions
of people. -
Major P. J. Harney â
Kajor P. J. Harney â
You may quote me as being strongly
in favor of erecting a monument to
Admiral Dewey. We of .the Pacific
Slope owe him a debt of gratitude, and
we ought to show him during his life-
time that his magnificent victory in
Manila Bay has endeared him to us.
I have read of the plan to present him
with a home in "Washington, and while
I think it a patriotic move on the part
of the citizens of this country, yet I
think a suitable monument in our
midst would be the better thing to do.
A statue of the admiral would be a'
lesson to us. our children and pos
terity. I am glad the citizens of our
city are taking an interest in it. as.
it shows the spirit of patriotism is
ever alive in their breasts. I would .
like to see the monument placed where
It could be easily seen and would prove
an attraction to our city. As it is pur-
posed to extend the park panhandle to
the intersection of Van Ness avenue
and Market street, I think it would.
be a splendid idea to erect it at that
point. It would not â¢ only mark the
beginning of our magnificent pleasure
grounds but it would add beauty and
interest to that section of the city.
General R. H. Warfieldâ
General R. H. Warfieldâ
A statue commemorative of Dewey's
victory? Why. of course I am in
favor of It. What American, and Call
fornian in particular, is not? My voice
and my purse are in support of such
a movement. There must be no delay
about it, either.
P. H. McCarthyâ
P. H. McCarthyâ
I believe that a monument to Admiral
Dewey erected in Golden Gate Park is
something that should be favored by
every citizen of the Pacific Coast.
While I am npt in favor of retaining
the Philippines. I do not think the
people of this coast can do too much to
show their appreciation of the magni
ficent valor of the great admiral who
destroyed the Spanish fleet in Manila
Bay. Furthermore, whatever benefit
the Pacific Coast may realize from the
occupation of the islands will be due
to Dewey's great victory, and San
Francisco, as the metropolis of the
coast, is the propers-place for the erec
tion of a monument to him.
Judge W. W. Morrow â
"It is an excellent proposition and.
shows that the spirit. of patriotism is
keen among our people," said Judge
W. W. Morrow this evening when in-
terviewed regarding a statue of Dewey
for .Golden Gate Park. "Dewey has
endeared himself to all true-hearted
citizens, both by his valiant exploits
and the diplomacy required afterward,
and I heartily favor The Call's pro-
ject of giving him merited recognition
on this coast. I doubt not that Mayor
Phelan will appoint a capable and en-
ergetic commission to take the matter^
in charge. Golden Gate Park is pecS
liarly suitable for such a statue. What*
little I can do in furtherance of the
project will be done gladly."

Why Grover Cleveland and Captain

ley 1). Evans, late of the battleship lowa,
and Grover Cleveland were scheduled to
participate iri the | cornerstone laying ex
ercises at Port Clinton to-day. They are
fishing at Middle Bass Island and at the
last moment backed out because of the
heavy sea on Lake Port Clinton. The
citizens were advised that the two noted
men were afraid of seasickness. They
said they would not suffer nausea for the
sake of showing themselves at Port Clin
ton. . . . .
Captain Evans was very seasick on his
trip to the island. He accounts for this
by saying that the waves of the lake are
short and choppy and the bqats are tossed
about indiscriminately, while on the ocean
the waves are long and rolling and the
motion is different. He is made the butt
of many jokes on account of this weak
ness. _________

THE SAJS FRANCISCO CALL, IKIDAY, MAY 19, 1899.
GOMEZ ADVISES
DISARMAMENT
Tells Cubans to Accept
Uncle Sam's Money.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, May 18.â The expected
manifesto of General Maximo Gome
was issued this evening, It reviews
his part in the negotiations with Gen
eral Brooke and speaks of his love for
Cuba and his sufferings in her behalf
in the past. General Gomes says:
The hour has now arrived for me to
raise .my voice in justification of mv po
sition and to describe the arduous work
i it? .done slnce my first visit to Gen
eral Brooke. I protested to him against
the sum ottered by the United â_ttes as
insufficient to accomplish the good in
tended. While waiting an answer to my
protest I Bought a solution of the ques
tion. General Brooke, representing the
chief magistrate of the united States,
announced his inability to add to the
sum already settled upon.
Speculators then attempted to inter
vene, ottering suggestions which were re
fused by me. They presented a proposi- j
tion to the military assembly; but the]
scheme was frustrated by President Mc-
Kinley *s refusal to recognize that body. . .
I tried the formation of a militia a
practical solution, and General Brooke.
who approved the idea, .asked me for a
summary of my views on the subject.
To this I replied that 10,000 men were all
it would be possible to get from the for- i
mer Cuban army without distinction to
race. My answer was sent to President
McKinley, together with a persona] let- j
ter giving explicit reasons why such a
course was necessary.
I had many conferences with General
Brooke In my endeavors to discover such
a plan of payment as- would not exclude
the men who had never carried arms.
General Brooke insisted, upon the surren
der of arms before the receipt of money,
and 1 also desired that such arms as
had already been surrendered and such
as should be surrendered hereafter might
be delivered to warehouses, In the care
of Cuban armorers, to be paid out of the
Cuban treasury. I do not think it a dis
grace that the Cuban soldiers, should re
ceive, from a Government which is able |
to pay, sums that will relieve their imme
diate needs. Special certificates will be
given to all, redeemable by the Cuban re
public as soon as it is established.
I am convinced that it is compatible
with obtaining peace to have an army
with arms reserved, to defend. Cdba
against her enemies and in the meantime
to be guarded as the relics of a glorious
struggle. In my judgment, whether the
arms were disposed of to the municipali
ties or to. the armorers, it would be all j
the same under the Intervening govern
ment. The Cuban Commissioners, how- 1
ever, refused to agree with General ;
Brooke and the Americans and declined
to fix dates and places where the Cuban
soldiers could deliver up arms and re
ceive payment from the American pay
masters after, identification by their re
spective chiefs. A' â â â  -.-.-
After further praise of "General
Brooke's consideration," and a declara
tion of his own desire to correct an er
ror existing in Cuba with respect to the
United States, he goes on to say:
I did not act alone, as seems to be
popularly believed, but always consulted
with our officers. My advice to you now
is to return to your homes with the
amounts offered by the Intervening gov
ernment and to practice patience, which
will be an additional proof of your hero-
Ism. In this way we shall reconstruct
most rapidly the homes consecrated by
the blood of martyrs, blood poured out
in behalf of a purpose now attained, and
thus begin this cycle of liberty with the
grandest prospects, .prophesied by the
heralds of future prosperity and peace; â 
This work Is your portion. Let no pre
text Interfere with the attainment of the
independent government for which three
generations of Cubans have struggled
with all sacrifice, and which is now prom
ised by a noble nation pledged to obtain
for us our rights. Meanwhile I shall re
main where I am generously Invitedâ
among the Cubans. I shall work without
cessation for our aspirations and In a
narrow sphere assigned me if necessary.
And if It happens that all logical, and
just methods shall be exhausted without
the desired result, I will go to Washing
ton and there tell of Cuba and her sacred
Ideals of an Independent republic and will
arbitrate the destiny of our country.

our love of independence and liberty,

Commissioner Evans.
Commissioner Evans.
NEW YORK, May 18.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: The action
of the- G. A. R. encampment in Syracuse,
N. V., in passing resolution demanding
the removal of H. Clay. Evans, Commis
sioner of Pensions, following closely simi
lar action by the G. A. R. of Kansas, Is
causing the administration considerable
concern. Officials see the hand of the
pension attorney at work, and realize
that he is not to be despised when he be
gins an attack upon the Pension Office
through the Grand Army.
The sole cause of complaint against
Commissioner Evans is that he is hold
ing too rigidly to the law in acting upon
applications for new and increased pen
sions, and administration officials are be
ginning to realize that unless the Com
missioner can be induced to stretch the
law a little, so as to facilitate the. settle
ment of a large number of pending cases,
the pension vote may not be cast as sol
idly for President McKinley next year as
it was in 1596. ' . ' . . . yY.\-k

BOISE;' Idaho,' May IS.â The situation
in the Coeur d'Alenes has been greatly
relieved by the decision .of District
Judge Mayhew in the habeas corpus
cases brought to^ secure the release
from prison of the Commissioners of
Shoshone County, who were arrested
after martial law was declared and
ousted from office.
Judge Mayhew denied every material
contention of the applicants. Their
main hope was based on the contention
that the suspension of habeas corpus
was a right of the legislative branch
of the government rather than the ex
ecutive, unless delegated by the former
in the same manner as other laws are
passed. Mayhew held this to be er
roneous.
Owners or representatives from all
leading Canyon Creek and Mullan
mines are here to-day and will stand
solidly by the State officials. One of
them said: "We furnished these men
work at $3 50 a day when lead was
$2 50 a ton, and we were barely paving
expenses. Now, when we have a chance
for a good profit they close us down by
their unlawful acts, and we feel that
such men do not deserve work."

Bunker Hill, which employs non-union
men, is now the only mine running in

BAKERSFIELD, May 18.â Jack Ben
nett, the eye-witness in the Brown mur
der case, who told the story of the kill
ing of Cain yesterday, was given a ter
rible cross-examination to-day. He was
under fire all the forenoon and part of
the afternoon. It developed that the writ
ten statement favorable to Brown was
extracted from him while in the hands of
Brown's friends and he said: "I agreed
to swear to that." But when Bennett got
with his father, who lives at Reedley,
Bennett said: "I told him the true story
of the killing, just what I swore here."
Bennett appeared to be afraid of
Brown. He admitted yesterday having
promised Brown that he would tell a dif
ferent story. ' Beyond this the witness'
testimony was unshaken.
The circumstantial testimony is hard
against the prisoner. The question of ad
mitting Cain's dying statement came up
to-day. . .

SAN QUENTIN PRISON. May 18.â
Death is lurking in the dusty atmos
phere of the jute mill, . and at least
four guards, known to be marked for
the knife of the assassin, are continu
ally on the alert lest the floor of the
old building be stained with their life
blood.
Despite the angry denials of Warden
Hale and Captain Edgar that further
trouble is anticipated another prisoner
deliberately violated a rule of disci
pline to-day, and while being led to
Captain Edgar's office. threw away an
eight-inch dirk of prison make.
The absolute refusal of Captain Ed
gar to throw the ringleaders in the plot
of murder into the dungeon has caused
the guards under the ban of the human
fiends to seek \he aid of Captain Bir
lem in taking precautions for their saf
ety, and yet wh'en Captain Birlem in
formed the Warden of the impending
danger he was dismissed without even
a word of thanks. â  V .
Driven to a last extremity, the guards ;
have been forced to ask the interference
of the Marin County authorities. Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac arrived from
San Rafael this morning, and made an
investigation by request. He found the
existing conditions so alarming that he
states his intention in case of.the death
of Guard McDonald to arrest "Frisco
Slim," O'Neill, Wilson and Phelan, and
prosecute them as accomplices before
the fact. Not only Is this state of alarm
not overdrawn, but despite his evasions
and denials, Warden Hale was forced
this evening to admit every fact pub- j
lished in to-day's Call, although he in
formed the evening papers that there j
was not a grain of truth in the story/
Captains Birlem and Edgar are per
sonal enemies and never speak except j
on official business, and it is alleged !
by a prominent prison official that the j
reason why Captain Edgar permits the j
guards' lives to be exposed to such |
deadly dangers is that he believes Cap
tain Birlem to be furnishing the papers
with the facts concerning his actions.
Warden Hale has all along been on
Captain Edgar's side and virtually ad
mitted where his sympathies He by
bringing the subject of this enmity up
in an interview this evening.
Dr. Lawlor refuses to say whether or

DARING EXPEDITION
OF A BRAVE VOLUNTEER
TACOMA. Wash., May 18.â News was
received here to-day from Manila of a
dangerous expedition undertaken last
month by George Harlan or Company X,
First Washington Volunteers. The Waits
burg volunteer undertook to carry a mes
sage to General Lawton through the
country infested with insurgents. He
paddled thirty miles up the river in a
birch canoe, at times pursued by rebels
and narrowly escaped capture. His dar
ing trip resulted successfully, and he was
highly commended.
Freedom, published at Manila, gives
this account: As there had not been any
communication since Lawton's expedition
reached Santa Cruz it was decided to send
a scout with messages to General Law
ton and find if they were all right It was
finally decided to send Harlan in a canoe
as he was familiar with a birch bark long
before he came to the Philippines. But
when one thinks of the lonely trip through
the enemy's lines, a distance of thirty
miles, on strange waters, with nothing
â¢but a fragile canoe of eighteen inches
width and twelve feet long under him it
brings out the dangers of the trip
Harlan embarked at 6:30 p. m. Sunday
and started up the river to the lake. It
was not so dark but that the sharp-eyed
natives soon discovered him and as he got
out of the river he noticed several canoes
after him. Then there was an exciting
chase, in which the natives were gradual
ly gaining on the. bold scout. When he
saw there was no escape in a straight
run he dodged into a lagoon and crossed
it, but was persistently followed. One
last desperate chance was all that was
left and he took it.
Being now in line between the pursuing
party and a large fish net he was invis
ible to them on account of the darkness.
So he paddled for the net as fast as he
could. On reaching it he broke through
noiselessly and lay down in his canoe
under the friendly shadow. The natives,
never thinking of such a bold trick, sep
arated, three going on each side of him,
Harlan lying safely concealed. â¢
After resting he shoved out again and
made his way along the shadow of the
land until he got to Santa Cruz. Twice
more he was pursued by armed natives,
but each time succeeded in giving them
the slip. He reported to General Lawton
and was highly praised for his: daring
trip. . .-â  ', â¢.-...â â :.-.:.'.. -â¢"-;â 'â ;â¢â :

' NEW YORK, May 18.â A cable to

Pope has expressed his approval of the
anti-expansion speech made by Bishop.
B. _. Spaulding of Peoria at the Chi-^
cago mass-meeting on April 3.
In the address just approved by the
Pope Bishop Spaulding said:
The rise and fall of nations, as of In
dividuals, are determined by moral forces.
We have never looked upon ourselves as
predestined to subdue the earth, to" com-
pel other nations with sword and shell
to submit to our rule.
We have always believed in human
rights. In' freedom and opportunity, in
education and religion, and we have In
vited all men to come and enjoy the bless-
ings in "this half of the world which' God
has gjven us; but we have never dreamed
that they. were articles to be exported
and thrust down unwilling throats at the
point of the bayonet. â¢â â --â - {,'
We have sympathized with all op
pressed people, with Ireland, Greece, Ar
menia, Cuba; and now the American sol-
dier, who has never shouldered a 8 gun
except in a righteous cause, is sent 10.000
miles across the sea to shoot men whose
real crime is that they wish to be free.
If the inhabitants of -the Philippines came
gladly-, to- throw themselves into our arms
we should refuse to do more than counsel,
guide and protect them until they form
themselves into a stable and independent
government. ' 'â 'â  .
A war of conquest is in contradiction
with our fundamental principles of gov
ernment; it Is opposed to all our traditions.
The Bishop protested against imper
ialism, and declared that the American
i people were victims of contmercialism.
! He. added: - â 
If it is our destiny to become an em-
pire it is not our destiny to endure as a
republic. When the American people re
! solve not to hold what they never intended
: to take possession of they will have little
i difficulty in solving the Philippine prob
lem. Let them not hearken to the siren

MANILA, May IS.â (By Carrier
Pigeons from San Isidro and j
Candaba) â Major Kobbe sends i
his official reports to General i
Otis to-day by the Call-Herald
carrier pigeons. â¢ |
Definite peace propositions from the
Filipino Government are imminent.
The Americans positively have entire
control of the situation if the rainy
season does not set in within ten days
and make further military operations
impossible, should the insurgents still
prove intractable.
The purpose of the Filipino leaders
to give up the struggle against Ameri-
can authority was made known by two
delegates of the Filipino Peace Com-
mission, who remained in San Isidro
when it was captured and surrendered
to iwton'a advance guard.
In conversation with American offi
cers they said the Filipino force has
been for the last four days willing to
secure peace on any terms that Gen-
eral Otis might see fit to offer. They
declare that General Lawton, by . his
rapid and' energetic advance from
Balinag, has not allowed their forces a
moment's cessation from fighting. The
delegates added that Aguinaldo him-
self will sue for peace through the
Peace Commission within two days. If
he does not so act the Filipino Govern-
ment will promptly repudiate him. as
four-fifths of the natives are weary of j
war and desire an early ending of hos- I
tilities. .
The Filipino congress voted on May
6 to name a peace commission, which,
finally made up, consists of Buertca
mino, Del Pilar, Arguelles, Torres,
I'amprenos, Paterno and Herrera.
These delegates had intended to pro
ceed to General's Lawton's headquar
ters to begin negotiations for a pacific
settlement, but the American attack on
San Isidro caused them to take Might
to the northward. The two who re
mained here and surrendered assure
the Americans that the others will re
turn to San Isidro to-morrow to carry
out the original designs.
It is stated that Aguinaldo fled from
the town day before yesterday. He is
now reported to be at Cabanatuan,
eighteen miles north of San Isidro. The
whereabouts of General Gregorio del
Pilar is unknown. It is only certain
that he has gone northward.
Major Kobbe's brigade is moving
steadily northward on the way to make
& Junction with Lawton. Kobbe took the
town of Candaba this morning without
meeting any opposition.
Captain Grant, who commands the
flotilla of convoying gunboats, steamed
ahead of the other vessels with the
Laguna de Bai. Upon reaching the
town, which lies upon the right bank of
the Rio Grande, he found white flags
flying from all the windows. A native
school teacher who could speak Eng
lish came down to the river bank and
offered to surrender the town to the
American commander. He said that
the insurgent Governor of the place
and most of the inhabitants had fled
Into the bush to 'escape the Americans.
He sent out a messenger, who called
the frightened natives back, large num
bers of them returning.
Soon after the capture of the town
fifty cascos, loaded with natives and
their belongings, came floating down
the river. The people were returning
to their homes down the river. The
residents of Candaba say they are sat
isfied with the insurgent government.
but admit that they have not the
strength to resist the American army.
Two Spanish prisoners who have Just
arrived here from Neuva Civaka say
Aguinaldo has lost prestige with the
rebel army, which is described as be
ing completely demoralized, short of
food, suffering from disease, afraid of
the Americans and rapidly dissolving
kinto bands of pillagers. The prisoners
add that Generals Gregorio del Pilar
and Luna are the only influential Fili
pinos who are continuing resistance to
the Americans.
Aguinaldo's personal retinue was re
cently relieved of its baggage and mon
ey while on the way rrom San Isidro
to Cebanatan by marauders. -The Chi
nese are being victimized everywhere
by both rebels and looters.
ncamino, a prominent Fillnino
leader who was friendly to Spain and
Joined in the- compromise arrangement
whereby the Spaniards had hoped .to
conciliate the leaders without sacrific
ing too much, is reported as saying that
Aguinaldo Bits indoors crying, blames
himself for the miserable condition of
the country and is afraid to surrender.

NEW YORK, May 18.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Satisfied that favorable re
sults will follow the meeting of the
Filipino emissaries with the American
Commission the authorities are specu
lating upon the terms Aguinaldo's
agents will ask. If it be for a cessation
of hostilities it will be immediately
answered in the negative, and General
Otis will reply further that uncondi
tional surrender must precede any con
cessions made by the Americans. What
Is regarded as more probable is that
an effort will be made to obtain special
terms for Aguinaldo and his immediate
chiefs.
"They will not be granted," said an
official with whom I talked. "Aguin
aldo and his chiefs will be treated like
other Filipinos. They will meet the
same consideration that will be given
the ordinary Filipinos, and no more.
If Aguinaldo is dissatisfied he will be
exiled and not allowed to return to the
islands until he is willing to- obey the
laws as other natives will do."
Officials of the War Department have
no idea that the dispatch of the new
commission to Manila by Aguinaldo is
for the purpose of gaining time. When
Colonel Arguelles first came to Manila
to propose peace the American forces
continued their operations,' and while
there may be no active advance during
the coming negotiations scouting par
ties now out will reconnoiter the coun
try in advance of McArthur and Law
ton, in order that they may continue
their advance.
The flight of the rebels to Tarlac ef
, fectually prevents their capture by the
closing in of Lawton's and Mac Arthur's
j columns, Tarlac being twenty-five
; miles to the northwest of San Isidro,
where Lawton has established his ad
! quarters, and about thirty-five miles to
> the northward of San Fernando, where
t General Mac Arthur's column is en
-1 trenched. But while it has been found
: impossible to bottle up the insurgent
army, their reduction from 9000 to 2500
i men shows the number of desertions
j which have occurred, due to the effect
i of the irresistible advance of the Am
; erican troops. It is expected that
Aguinaldo, concerning whose where
abouts the first definite information
was received from General Otis to-day,
will move with the men under his im
| mediate command and effect a junction
with the force at Tarlac. to be ready
j for the result of the conference to take
I place at Manila to-morrow.
General Otis was notified to-day not
to send home any of the tents with
which the volunteer troops have been
equipped. They will be retained for
the regulars, who are to relieve the
volunteers. The action of the depart
ment is in anticipation of the early
home-coming of the volunteers, all of
whom will be at San Francisco, it is
expected, within two months from the
time the first. troops leave.
There is no absolute information at
the War Department concerning the
i present strength of the American forces
under Mac Arthur, Lawton and Kobbe
which have been operating against the
insurgents north of Manila. The num
ber of men if each organization were up
to its maximum strength would be
16,500, but it is doubtful if their strength
totals 11,000 men. Mac Arthur's troops.
except one regiment, are volunteers.
All of Kobbe's men are regulars, re
cently arrived. Three of the six regi
ments under Lawton are also regulars.
There is one radical difference between
the volunteer and regular organization.
Losses in the former are permanent.
while the gaps in the ranks of the reg
ulars are being constantly filled by new
recruits. It is estimated that Mac A
rthur now has about 4500 men for ac
tive service; Lawton about 5000 and
Kobbe 1500.
General. Otis cabled the War Depart
ment to-day as follows:
MANILA, May Adjutant Gen
eral, Washington: Representatives of the
insurgent Cabinet and of Aguinaldo, who
Is in the mountains twelve miles north
of San Isidro, which was abandoned on
the 15th Inst., will send a comrriissiou to
morrow to seek terms of peace.
The majority of the force confronting
Mac Arthur at San Fernando has retired
to Tarlac, tearing up two miles of rail
way. This force has decreased to about
2500. ':â ' "â -'''â '"â 
Scouting parties and detachments are
moving to-day in various directions.
Kobbe Is on the Rio Grande. A great ma
jority of the inhabitants of the provinces
over which the troops have moved are
anxious for peace, and are supported by
members of the- insurgent Cabinet, The
aspect of affairs at* present Is favorable.

BOOM FOR OLIVES
GROWN NEAR MARYSVILLE
If Proper Concessions Are Made a
Large Pickling Plant Will Be
Erected.
MARYSVILLE, May IS.â the already
large canning and packing interests of
this section there is a good prospect for
the addition of an olivo pickling plant
that will give employment to a large num
ber of people during the season. If a
proposition wh'-h Manager Ehmann of
the Ehmann On ye- Company has submit
ted to the citizens of this place meets
their approval Marysville will be the site
of the plant.
His company owns a- twenty-acre tract
of olives in Colema Colony, four miles
south of this city, now nine years old, the
product from which in part will form its
pack the coming season.
Manager Ehmann states that his com
pany will shortly be ready to begin the
erection of its plant, and if the proper
facilities are afforded his people In the
shape of a lot he will locate the same at
this place. The company proposes to give
the proper assurance concerning the
amount of goods to be turned out each
season. .
Last year the Ehmann Company han
dled the crop from the Fogg olive grove of
forty acres, situated near Oroville. â¢ This
year it expects to handle at least 30,000
gallons of the fruit. .
Mr. Ehmann says the company's pack is
eagerly sought for. One Eastern com
pany handling such goods has offered to
take the entire output this season, be it
little or much, provided it be allowed to
place the goods on the market under its
own brands. This Mr. Ehmann has de
clined to do, desiring to preserve the dig
nity of his brands. He says the pack
made in future will carry as well the
name of the locality where they are put
In view of the fact that there is now in
course of construction a large packing
house in Yuba City for Rosenberg Bros.

ent summer will see more people em

CHINESE FORM
A BIG TRUST
Oriental Merchants at
Work on the Scheme.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, May IS.â Some of
the "most influential Oriental merchants
, are now working on a" scheme which is
i simply gigantic in its scope and one
! which undoubtedly will attract attention
In all parts of the American continent.
It is to form companies in every- city of I
consequence in the United States, Canada
and Australia, which will attempt to con- j
trol Chinese capital in order to promote i
and control Oriental industries. .
When Kang, the Chinese reformer, was
in Vancouver, he outlined the scheme to
a number of prominent Chinese and his
ideas were quickly acted upon. Interpre
ter Cum Vow, who is in the scheme, said
In "regard to it to-day:
"We have, no doubts about its success.
Our plan Is to give the Chinese a chance
to invest their money in this country and
to further all Chinese Industries. There
are at present 5,000,000 Chinese in Canada,
Australia and the United States, and they
; will all, we think, go into the scheme. As
! soon as our company Is formed here we
! will send out our agents and form com
â¢ panics in every city of any size in Can
! Ada, the United States and Australia. We
( expect to issue altogether about $60,000,000
i worth of stock. With the formation of
I the companies accomplished and the
stock Issued they will be brought under
one management with headquarters pos
sibly In Vancouver. Then a banking In-
stitution will be formed and investments
ln Chinese industries will be made on an
immense scale. Snares of the immense
trust will sell at $1 each, and already
several thousand dollars' worth have
been bought here by men who are making
only $1 a day."
The promoters, who are nearly all
wealthy men, are: Yip Sang, Hip Tuck
Lung. Charlie Yip Yen, Sam Kee, Dr.
Lvi, Lee Yuen and XV. A. Cum Vow.
A meeting will be held on Friday even
ing to elect officers. As soon as this Is
done agents will be appointed ln all parts
of Canada, the United States and Aus
tralia.
Rang, the Chinese reformer and refu
gee, who originated the scheme. Is said to
have invested a quarter of a million in it.
Chinatown is much excited over the
project and every Celestial In the city Is
said to be eager to purchase stock.
The whole concern Is simply an im
mense trust, although the promoters are
loth to acknowledge It.
Operations of the trust will not be con-
fined to Chinese Industries, aa it Is pro
posed to build steamers to run to China
and possibly construct a railway line in
Mexico. ________________ -.7*.
ATTORNEY GRADY IN
CONTEMPT OF COURT
Abuses a Magistrate in Court, Fights
a Policeman and Lands in
Jail.
FRESNO. May IS.â ln the Police Court
to-day. during the trial of Mrs. Rena
BroWn, a lodging-house keeper, W. D.
Grady, an attorney, was committed to
jail for contempt of court by Recorder
Cosgrave. The court also imposed a fine
of $25, which, however, the attorney has
not yet paid.
At the beginning of the trial the wit
nesses in the courtroom were put under
the rule excluding them when not on the
stand. Grady, who was attorney for the
defendant, insisted on having the names
of the witnesses so excluded called out in
open court. His request was denied, and
he became obstreperous, whereupon the
Recorder postponed the case and ordered
Grady committed.
Policeman L. B. Timmins arose to exe
cute the order of the court, but he had
no sooner laid his hand on Grady's
shoulder than the attorney struck him In
the face. A lively scuffle ensued, in which
Grady came out second best. He was
thrown to the floor and searched, with
the assistance of other officers, and a re
volver was taken from his hip pocket.
He was then taken to the lockup.
Grady spent the night behind the
bars, In spite of the efforts of
friends to secure his release. It
is understood that he will be liberated at
10 o'clock to-morrow morning, the hour
set for the trial to proceed.

NEW YORK, May 18.â dispatch to
the Commercial Advertiser from Lon
don says: A considerable part of the
current agitation in both London and
in the Transvaal Is concocted to force
the imperial Government to more ex
treme measures than it thinks wise.
The Government hopes that the recent
dispatch of Joseph Chamberlain, the
Colonial Secretary, which was a strong
remonstrance, not an ultimatum, and
the approaching conferences of Presi-
dent Kruger and Sir Alfred Milner,
Governor of Cape Colony and High
Commissioner of South Africa, will
bring about reforms in the extension of
the franchise to Outlanders and of the
independence of the courts from Boer
influence.
These are virtually the demands of a
fair-minded majority of the Outland-
ers. France and Germany tacitly ap-
prove them.
The extreme party in Johannesburg
and London is urging the Government
to threaten force, perhaps by the dis-
patch of reinforcements, to Africa, to
secure these and other reforms. Other-
wise the extremists believe that the
negotiations will be without result. The
extremists have influential representa
tives here and in Africa vigorously and
privately pressing the Government and
public opinion through the newspapers.
Cecil Rhodes has some share in these
efforts. If the Government fails to get
the extremists' desires some prefer to
see the conferences miscarry. The Gov
ernment is-informed that in reality the
reported plot is connned, however, to
turbulent and irresponsible men. There
lis no present evidence that implicates
the extremist, leaders.
AN ARABIAN WHO
PASSES BAD MONEY
Mansour Zerour Arrested for Ped
dling Without a License and
Held as a Counterfeiter.
SALINAS, May 18.â Mansour Zerour, an
Arabian, who was at the Midwinter Fair
at San Francisco, has been jailed for
peddling without a license, which, how-.
ever, is simply to hold him preparatory
to filing a more serious charge. He trav
els from town to town ostensibly to sell
his wares, but as the facts seem to mdi
cate for the important though risky busi
ness of distributing counterfeit money.
I Last Saturday he was in Bsadley and
commenced his work, when he was arrest-
ed and convicted for the offense stated.
During the trial the following facts came
to light: %': - â â¢*â¢â¢â '< *v- -
Zerour passed through this part of the
country a year ago and while in Bradley
he passed a counterfeit sliver dollar and
two half-dollars upon Station Agent Law
son. The victim said nothing, but when
Zerour appeared this time he went for
the peddler and threatened to have him
arrested If he did not give him good
money for the spurious coin passed a year
ago. Zerour readily compiled and handed
out genuine silver for the bogus coin.
Lawson then had the fellow watched, and
when he was tried told of the circum
stances. When Zerour was searched the
old bogus coin which he received from
Lawson and several new bright counter
feit dollars and half-dollars were found
in his possession. Letters and other arti
cles were also found on his person which
were sent to the United States Marshal
at San Francisco by Sheriff Farley and
may furnish a clew to the counterfeiter's
mint. Zerour claims to be a member of
the firm of Hedssldder & Zerour, 106 Na-
toma street, San Francisco.
ELECTED MODERATOR OF
PRESBYTERIAN ASSEMBLY
Dr. B. F. Sample of New York De-
feats Dr. It. E. Coyle of Oak-

MINNEAPOLIS, May 18.â Rev. Dr. R.
F. Sample of Westminster Church, New
York, was elected moderator of the one
hundred and eleventh annual assembly
of the Presbyterian church in the United
States, which convened in Westminster
Church to-day.
Immediately after rollcall in the after
noon the election of a moderator was
taken up, and Dr. Sample was elected on
the first ballot, receiving 338 votes, 300
being necessary to a choice, to 127 for the
Rev. Mattheas Haines of the First
Church, Indianapolis, and 133 for the Rev.
Dr. R. E. Coyle of Oakland. Cal. The
contest was a spirited one, and Dr. Sam
ple's election Is regarded as a triumph for
the conservative element.
Rev. John Dlnsmore. in the most elo
quent of all nominating speeches, put for
ward Rev. Dr. R. E. Coyle of Oakland.
Cal., who was regarded as the liberal can
didate." Rev. Mr: Dlnsmore described Dr.
Coyle's merits and begged the assembly
once more to name a moderator from the
Pacific Coast, which felt Itself isolated
and in need of the inspiration that would
flow from such a choice. It took almost
an hour to take the ballot-
John Balcom Shaw, a director of the
Union Theological Seminary, in which Dr.
Arthur C. McGlffert is a professor, cow
firms the statement that Dr. McGlffert
has sent a letter anent the so-called
heresy case. It Is believed that this letter
contains a satisfactory explanation of Dr.
McGlff ert's statements about the Lord's
Supper in his book, "The Christian
Church in the Apostolic Age," and that
therefore no heresy proceedings will be
taken against him. '".".'.['.:â <â ' â â¢

PARIS, May 18.â French author
ities are certainly forbearing*. All Paris
has been upset by the postmen's strike,
but it is announced that all will be
forgiven and forgotten if the men will
return to work to-morrow. { It remains
to be seen whether- they will be eaually
obliging, but the Government assures
us that all will be well in any case.
The whole trouble arises from the
system of centralization prevailing
here. All letters are received at the
central postofhce, where they are sort
ed according to streets. â¢ Then carriers.
each with his allotted share, are sent
off to their respective districts in spe
cial omnibuses. The consequence is !
that a few men are able to paralyze the
service from the start.
The forty sorters who arrived at the
main office in Rue de Louvre, this
morning, knew the Senate had rejected
the proposal to increase their magnifi
cent starting salary of $200 a year by
$40, and they were up in arms. . Four
hundred odd carriers readily listened
to the voice of the tempter, and by the
time the postal service ought to have
been in full swing there were 2000 muti
neers. It must be mentioned that the
postmen begin at" $200 a year, with a
possibility of reaching $300. and they
also receive $30 for rent and $10 for
shoe leather.
It was rather amusing to see red
trousered soldiers laden with mail bags.
distributing letters which the postmen
refused to carry, each under the es
cort of a pompous policeman with a
bayonet at his side.
Unkind people said that the escort.
which was for protection, was really
to show the way to the garrison of
Paris, consisting chiefly of raw country
lads, who don't know one street from
anothe*r.
Soldiers of the line did not have* a
monopoly of the work, however, for
municipal guards, half soldiers and
half police, were called out to protect
the postotnce.
There is balm in Gilead. however, for
a review which .was to be held to
morrow was postponed, for which re
lief the "Pioupiou" is truly grateful.
One leading bank, the Societe Gen
erale, wired 300 branches to communi
cate by telegraph until further orders.
The loss to business interests. is esti
mated at something like $3,000,000. and
bankers are praying earnestly for the
end of the strike, though they have
suffered less than the great dealers at
the general markets, who had perish
able commodities left on .heir hands.
PROMISE OF SOME
RECOUNTS AT STOCKTON
Several Republicans Beaten at the
Recent Election Make Charges of
Fraud at the Polls.
" STOCKTON, May 18.â The political situ
ation was warmer to-day than before the
election. There is much talk of frauds
and perversions of the intent of the elec
tion law by Boards of Election. It is
claimed that the Republican ticket, as a
result of factional differences, had few
active friends on the Election Boards,
and these allowed the Democrats to dic
tate all the decisions on the points raised.
It was definitely decided to-night to be
gin a contest on behalf of Fred M. Rowe,
the Republican nominee for Assessor,
who on the face of the unofficial returns
lost by thirty-four votes. It Is claimed
that in one precinct alone 'fifteen Repub
lican'ballots were thrown out on trifles.
It is also said sensational affidavits will
be filed. Of course many make state
ments at random which they will not
swear to when It comes to the. scratch:
but there seems to be evidence at hand
justifying a recount. After Rowe's con
test It Is expected that Washington
Tucker, who lost the office of Street Su
perintendent on the face of the unofficial
returns by 112, will follow with a contest,
and probably John Yardley. Republican
candidate for the Council in the First
Ward, will demand a recount.

MARYSVILLE, May While making

had narrow escapes from serious injury.
As It Is Miss Howlett's hands are badly

Both are under the doctor's treatment.
It appears that the young ladles were
making -a mixture of potassium chlorate
and sulphur -in order to produce oxidation
of the sulphur. Through. carelessness too
much of one of the compounds was used
with the result that there was an explo
sion, which wrecked the appliances In the
room and sent fragments of glass,' etc.,
in all directions. Some of the mixture
got into Miss Lisle's eyes.
The physician found it necessary to bind
several "arteries in Miss Howlett's left
hand. The thumb of her right hand had
the nail torn completely off.

WINTER WORK Of
THE KLONDIKERS
Wide Area of Good Pay
Claims in Vicinity of
Dawson.
Thousands of Men Now Laboring
Thousands of Men Now Laboring
Industriously fllong the
Various Creeps.
BY SAM W. WALL.
Sneclal Correspondence of The Call
DAWSON. April 7.â That part of the
big crowd that came down this big and
uncertain river la.st rprlng and summer
saw Dawson, heard the complaint that
"everything is staked" and passed on. has
worked out the result that most people
expected it to work out. Several ambi
tious towns have been born farther down,
an old town or two have been revived and
creeks and creeks and creeksâ a hundred
of them, many hitherto unheard ofâ have
found queer names for themselves and
been given strange places on strange, be
wildering maps. But the men who scaled
the glaciers or climbed the divides breast
deep with snow, hauling their sleds after
them Into regions to them unknown, have
ln very many cases come back this spring
triumphant.
So, from all along the river as far down
as Seventy Mile at least the blithe spring
air breathes deep satisfaction. Nothing
very sensational has been developed, but
there is a wide area of "good pay" located
and with that the miner is disposed to be
very hopeful, with a hope that scales up
ward till it becomes jubilant with some
(who have not been well accustomed to
good pay) and back again to mere con
tent with othersâ who have seen much of
the ounce-to-the-pan diggings of the
Klondike without being able to locate
any such for themselves. To these, how
ever, the difference In the size of the
claim on the different sides of the line
brings compensation.' The. miners on each
creek on the American side have the right
to fix the size of the claim within the
maximum of the law, but In almost all
of them the law of the books (1320x**t*O
feet) is the' law of the creeks in this re
gard, and .the man is considered difficult
to please who. finding twenty acres of 10
--cent gravel which he may claim as his
own for a recording fee of $2 50, still re
mains unhappy.
A great number of creeks, old and new.
have during the- past winter discovered
pay streaks of this quality, ranging from
3 to SO cents a. pan, through extensive
areas, and a new impulse has been given
to the entire region.
Saving nothing just here of Circle City
or below, there are three points at which
prospectors have centered and from which
they have radiated back Into the hills.
These are Forty Mile, at the mouth of
Forty Mile River, fifty-six miles below
Dawson, Eagle City, fifty-four miles be
low Forty Mile, and Seventy Mile, twenty
miles low Eagle. With an Immense re
gion back of these places, veined with
hundreds of creeks, most of them
now known to be gold bearing, each has
Its banner creek of which It boasts. At
Forty Mile Creek they conjure with Jack
Wade, at Eagle City Slate Creek is the
word and at Seventy Mile Flume. Of
these Jack Wade has within the past
few weeks become pre-eminent. The
find there rises out of the common level of
"3 to 10 cent pans" that has, In reputa
tion, spread Itself hitherto over all that
vast region Indefinitely spoken of as
"the American side," like a statue to
Croesus in Poverty Flat. Forty Mile
stands, geographically, but one remove
from Dawson, however, and in such close
companionship with Gold Hill It takes
much to excite its neople. . A few days
ago six ana were taken out of a hole in
No. S below upper discovery on Jack
Wade running in succession as follows:
$3 20. $1 20, $2, $6, $3 60, $1 47. While the
men were digging ln this hole several big
chunks of gold, round and smooth as the
pebbles of a brook, fell from the walls, to
the astonishment and. delight of the dig
gers, for they had not until that time had
any suspicion that their dirt was worth
above ii cents to thy pan. One of the
nuggets weighed' $15 20, another $16 and
another $â¢''s SO. The creek is, of course,
now located from end to end with a
double row of benches or side claims. It
Is about twenty-two miles long and Is
about sixty miles from the town of Forty
Mile. The town is in Canadian territory,
the creek In American. The trail to the
creek leads up Forty Mile River to Steel
Creek, forty miles from the mouth, cross
ing the international boundary at Sam
Patch's, twenty-three miles up. By way
of Steel Creek and over a low divide the
prospector gets Into Grace Creek, a small
tributary of Wade.
There are several hundred men now
Working on the creek, about 200 having
gone In since the big find was made. The
strike was made on No. 8 below upper dis
covery by the owners, Taylor & Able,
there being two in the partnership of the
latter name, though they are not related.
Previous to the fall of the big nuggets
the best pan had been 20 cents, with 2*4
to 4 feet of gravel, in which that kind or
pay was found. Bedrock is from 9 to 15
feet deep and the ground is easily worked.
Tile gold is of light color, worn smooth,
and closely resembles that of Napoleon
Gulch, which, on the other side divide,
heads up In the same hills. Jack Wade
Creek empties into Walker Fork of Forty
Mile River. Work is, or was at the time
of my visit, being done on Berglund's
claim, No. 16: Oilman Bros.', No.. 13; on
No. 4 below the upper end, and on Frank
Copley's, Gus Hunsucker's and Ed Mayer's
claims, 4, 5 and 6, where good pay was be
ing taken out. On the lower end of No. 2
A. Stewart was taking. out dirt ranging
from 6 to 25 cents, his high pan being
$1 65. Clark & Myers have sunk thirteen
holes crosscutting their claim and found
pay in each of the holes. In No. 4 above
the mouth Henry Benls, with little pros
pecting, found as high as 40 cents to the.
pan.
Altogether thirty claims have been pros
pected on the creek this winter and every
one has developed pay. The claims on the
creek are generally 1000 feet; a few that
were staked before this -regulation was
made arc allowed to remain at 1320 feet.
The creek was staked in great part In the
names of people who were never on the
creek, powers of attorn* being used by
general consent. It is reasonably certain
that, should the creek turn out as It is
now expected It will, these claims will be
jumped and plenty of trouble result. The
creek Is staked from an upper and lower
discovery and also from the mouth up to
lower discovery. Jack Wade, for whom
It is named, Is an old Yukoner who Is
said to have got lost in there some
years ago in ranging over the hills, but
after some weeks of wandering came out
with the news that this was a good creek

was a town long before Circle City was
thought of. It is called Forty Mile be
cause It was supposed to bo forty miles
below Fort Reliance, Jack M cQuesten's
rarly establishment (some ten miles down
tho river from Dawson), only a few
crossed lops of which establishment re
main. Forty Mile River is a lung- but
shallow stream with many divisions In
winter it affords an excellent trail, but
in summer It Is not navigable except for
poling boats, and the canyon, about fif
teen miles from Its mouth, adds greater
difficulty to this difficult method. Fifty
three miles from the mouth O'Brien
Creek, which heads in the American
'reek country, enters the river, and eigh
teen miles farther up the North Fork
branches, away In the same direction
with a hundred tributaries. South Fork
swings away in the opposite direction,
beading up ln the Sixty Mile divide. Den
nlson's Fork on the south and Mosquito
on tho north divide the waters again in
' like manner farther up, each having
] my tributaries.
Walker's Fork is the principal branch
! of the South Fork, and It Is into this,
j heading back toward the main river and
i Forty Mile town, that Jack Wade Creek
j enters. Other tributaries of Walker's
I Fork where pay has been found are Po-
I ker Creek, Davis and Liberty creeks, the
! best of which Is Poker Creek, and the
best of this is in Canadian territory.
Good pay has been found on Walker's
I Fork Itself at or near No. 36, below up
j per discovery, which is near the boun
j dary line. Lemon t brothers, XV. H. Car-
nahan and L. P. Stockings own three
. claims in this vicinity, and have found 28
| cents to the pan by the bucketful. They
! have prospected sixty feet across and got
1 nay dirt all the way. The owner of 12 be-
low. Cherry, Is also taking out good pay.
I Poker Creek has developed excellent
prospects, and a number of men are
working there. J. T. Hayes and two oth-
I ers are said to have taken out $2800 In six
I weeks and have uncovered enough to
I wash out $10,000 this summer.
Davis Creek has been known for some
time to' be good diggings. An old man
named McDonald, however, owns nearly
! the whole creekâ claimsâ and neither
i works himself nor allows others to work.
He lives there with -his young wife, whom
!he married in Juneau some years ago
j when he went out with $17,000 in his sack.
McKinley and Liberty. Crow, Turk and
i Tigner creeks have been stampeded and
I staked, but since then little has been
I heard of them, alt-hough coarse gold has
| been found there. All creeks coming Into
! Canyon Creek are found to be gold-bear
j ing. Among these Woods Creek has fur
i nished many a man a grub stake with a
few weeks' labor. Camp Creek, Kalama-
zoo and Squaw are all said to carry pay,
but they are as yet almost unprospected.-
A number of men went up Dennisons
Fork this last winter, but have not yet
reported. This is true also of the Middle
Fork, and the towns of Forty-mile and
â  Eagle City are awaiting them with great
expectations.
Chicken Creek, which prior to the rising
of Jack Wade was the banner creek in
tile Forty-mile district, empties into
Mosquito Fork. Nothing has as yet been
found on Mosquito Fork proper, Chicken
Creek is a very small stream. A man can
jump over it at high water, and it will
be. difficult to get a good sluice head at
that time. There are only a tew claims
about Discovery being worked, but they
are being worked thoroughly. Joe Mathe-
son and Joe Dyer own Discovery, and
they have 100 holes, down. The claim, is
being worked chiefly on the lay system,
and the busy picture it presents eclipses
even Jim Morrison's "No. 39" Hunker. It
Is said of Matheson that he has "been
plugging round the country" for twelve
years, getting deeper and steadily deeper
In debt to the company stores tn spite of
his best endeavors. Discovery on Chicken
will this year square for him all old ac-
counts and give him a home stake besides.
The upper end of Pearson's No. 1. above,
has two lays working, but the lower end
is being honeycombed, fifteen men being
at work. Their high pan held $39.
Peco & Co. are working No. - above and
No. 1 below. Water has prevented much
work being done on No. 1 below.. Three
men are at work on No. 2 above, which
has been held and merely represented for
four years. They are now taking out a
dump and have got as high as 75 cents
to the pan.
Alex McDonald paid $1000 on No. 4 above,
but lost it, a man from Dawson restak-
ing it.
One lay Is being worked on Thomas ,
Pike's No. 6 above. Good pay Is found
there.
Ten lays were let on No. 2 below, but no
i dump is being taken out. A few pans
were taken .showing as high as 20 cents,
but as for the rest nothing better than
good colors were found. Little else has
been developed downstream until No. 11
is reached. There the creek bottom is
very- wide, but they have been getting 15
to 20 cent pans. Below this very little
work has been done.
STONEHOUSE Is a tributary or continu
ation of Chicken Creek. Nos. 2 and 3 are
being worked. McDonald took out a
j dump on No. 2 and on No. 3 four lays are
working, and the* dirt is estimated as
worth 18 cents to the pan. On No. 4 two
lays are being worked, but they have no
dump to speak of. Three claims are be-
ing worked on Dry Pup, that comes in at
No. 6. Some work is being done on two
or three other pups, as well as some
benches. A bench off No. 2 Stonehouse Is
said to yield an average of 12 cents. Wash
gravel is found all along the top of the
divide between Chicken, Stonehouse and
â¢ Meyers Fork.
FRANKLIN CREEK and NAPOLEON
GULCH enter the South Fork
of Forty Mile below Mosquito
Fork. Both are producers. A
number of lays are being worked sue
, cessfully on Franklin Creek, and the
: North American Transportation and
Trading Company is doing considerable
i work on property they own In Napoleon
! Gulch. The formation there is most dif-
I ficult to work and pay dirt Is found in an
| inch and a half on bed rock. This is
15 feet down under a wicker work of roots
! and moss. The gold Is all in large pieces
j and smooth, like watermelon seeds. The
gold of Jack Wade Creek and of Franklin
1 Creek, which head up with Napoleon, is
exactly like It. The gold of Chicken
Creek, on the contrary, is generally fine
powder.
O'BRIEN CREEK, which comes into
Forty Mile 53 miles from the mouth. Is
a long stream that yet remains to be
prospected. It has one tributary*, how-
ever, that gives It Importance. This is
Dome Creek. A great dealt has been
. heard of Dome Creek In Dawson this
winter. There is a pretty tale told of it,
of how two men went out in '97 to
Seattle, both having heavy gold sacks,
but one having also the consumption.
The one died, but before doing this he
told to the man who nursed him the secret
of where he had gotten his gold, giving
him a map and such careful directions
I that subsequently a party whom he dis-
patched in had no difficulty ln finding the
diggings, together with the cabins form-
erly occupied by the men and the old
rockers they had used. The creek had
In the meantime, however, suffered one
of these latter day stampedes, from
which no break in the hills wide enough
to be visited by daylight can hope to
escape, especially one with an old rocker
on It. I believe, however,- the Seattle
party succeeded In getting the claim by
some means, and it Is deemed valuable.
John E. Barrett and party who own
Discovery and one above on Dome Creek,
have sluiced off 300 feet and will shovel
in .this summer. Several other claims
are being worked on the creek and pans
of $150 and $200 are not unusual.
THE NORTH FORKâ More men have
turned up the North Fork than into any
other branch of the Forty Mile this win-
I ter, and previous to Jack Wade it was
considered much tho most hopeful divis-
ion of the district. There Is a loop in the
i creek which Is called the North Fork
; Kink. A company has been formed to di
: vert the water by cutting across the loop
and leaving the creek bed for several
miles dry and easily worked. As one goes
I up the North Fork
HUTCHINSON CREEK Is the first
j tributary where much effort to find
treasure is discovered.. There has been a
good deal of prospecting there during all
i the winter, but glaciers and water have
greatly handicapped the workers. On Dis
covery $1 50 has been taken out of one
I pan.
MONTANA CREEK on the left going
up and FRENCH GULCH and CONFED-
I ERATE CREEK on' the right, tributaries
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 19, 1899.
of Hutchinson, all show good pay in re-
sponse to rather, hasty prospecting. F.
Bennett and Elliot Westfall on Confed
erate are getting out good dumps. Prog-
ress in this direction brings the traveler
Into I that region which Is * claimed by
Eagle City as its own. To be understood
geographically, according to the accepted
method of approach to it, therefore, one
must talk of It from the Eagle City
standpoint. Before leaving the .Forty
Mile district, however, it may be said In
a general way that the work done in the
whole region has been little â  more than
mere prospecting, or where the pay has
been located the work being done Is pre-
paratory to summer ground sluicing. The
ground is generally shallow, and most of
the claim owners and laymen, aside from
getting out lumber for sluice-boxes or
stripping tho surface, are "mushing" in
their grub for the summer's work. It Is
estimated that there are about 1200 men
at work in the district covered in the
foregoing. Including about a hundred at
work on Miller and Glacier creeks of the
Sixty Mile district, who outfit from this
point, and about 250 people in the town of
Forty Mile and at Fort Cudahy, just
across the river. The town and all these
diggings, struck a paralyzing blow by the
big finds of the Klondike, are now reviv-
ing and are destined to a new life and
far greater activity and more rapid devel
opment through the overflow from the
Klondike than those finds have called in
from over the face of all the earth. These
people are generally poor, however. All
they have with which to enter the strug
gle Is their pick and shovel and their two
hands and the steam which may be ap-
plied to these with their own poor little
outfit. And this outfit they must carry
with them wherever they goâ the
creeks and over the divides. So the work
rs very slow to begin with, and only those
creeks that have been previously worked
I and the pay streaks located can hope to
turn out something above a grubstake
I this year. Of these Chicken Creek will
! take first place. It is estimated that
$100,000â some say twice as muchâ will bo
' cleaned up from the four or five claims
| being worked there. Nearly all the work
of the district, other than by claim own
' ers themselves, Is done on the lay sys
tem, 50 per cent being allowed. The old
diggings of Miller and Glacier creeks are
paying some wages at $1 per hour. The
ground throughout the entire district,
however,' Is for the most part shallow,
and better worked in summer time, and
it will be next fall rather than this spring
that they will tell what they know- about
gold.
All this applies equally to the diggings
and the men of Eagle City. Eagle City,
a town of 800 people, has. since the Ice
went out last spring, risen up at the
mouth of Mission Creek. Not exactly
under the shadowâ every man writing
about it will probably be tempted to
sayâ but shouldering up against that
great rock that marks a point In the
landscape at the mouth of Mission Creek.
But ___le City Is not In or under the
shadow of a great rock or any other
shadow. Its people are very proud of it
| and believe it will grow to be a big and
! permanent city. It has Its parties and its
! politics, and each man In his bonnet has
some sort of a bee or ether. A short time
ago it was violently addicted to the
miners' meeting, but with that craving
j for variety and yearning for office that
i marks the true American it has now
elected for Itself a civil government of its ;
own out of which it may enjoy an annual i
election. These are .as exciting in their I
small way as was ever an election any- j
j where. As the result of the last one. i
! after much' hustling for votes, some of
i which were even dragged in with dogs
and sleds from the distant creeks, they
have a Mayor or president of a Council ;
of five, W. M. Woody: and the Councilâ |
A. J. Kelsey, J. H. Robinson. S. B. Ballon
and Thomas Aisbltt; a Judge, A. Heavens;
a Recorder, Thomas McMahon; a Treas
: urer, P. J. Meyer, and a Marshal, M.
Mather, and the Marshal has twelve
deputies. A code of civil, sanitary and '
criminal regulations has been adopted. j
The townsite, containing eighty-seven |
acres, has been surveyed and streets laid
out. The town contains 500 cabins, while
at the same place this day of the month
last year there was just one cabin, one of
those "miner's cabins" built by the
pioneers as a common, free-to-all stop- j
ping place for travelers. The people have
petitioned Sitka or Washington to have
Eagle City made the capital of a new
judicial district and to have a land office ;
opened there, and they hope their wishes
may be fulfilled this spring. Captain
Richardson, United .States military com-
mandant on the Yukon, has had ten acres
above the town on the river front set
aside for barracks. A detachment of the
soldiers now stationed at Circle City will
be sent up on an early spring boat and |
the barracks will be built, The Alaska
Exploration Company and the North
American Transportation and Trading I
Company have built large warehouses, i
and the Alaska Commercial Company,
now renting a storehouse, has let a con-
tract for a big building, work upon which '
will commence at once. There are half a :
1 dozen smaller stores, with a complement j
of saloons, restaurants and the like. !
Without one public dance hall they have ; '
a circulating library and a literary so-
ciety. The town is about fifteen miles
from the boundary line on the American
aide, and this fact gives its people the ;
hope of securing much more of the trade
of the miners of the Forty Mile district
than would otherwise fall to them. For
by taking goods over the trails that bad
away from Eagle City Into that country,
the national line need not be crossed and
the necessity of paying duty -will be avoid- |
cd. The winter trails lead up American j
and Mission creeks and by the crossing of ;
a low divide drop down Into the tributaries j
of the north fork of Forty Mile and
thence any division of that creek may be \
reached. The diggings on the South, Den- ;
nison and Mosquito forks are of course j
more easily reached from and more
naturally tributary to the town of Forty j
Mile, but they are nearly all In Ameri- ;
can territory while the international
boundary line, to cross which Is to settle
with a customs collector, stretches be-
tween them and the town. Forty Mile,
to be sure, may find a means of overcom-
ing this difficulty, but If she cannot
Eagle will certainly build some more log j
houses upon the trade of the South Fork. j
But that is a tale of a town or of two |
towns and this is a tale of the mines.
MISSION CREEK, at the mouth of]
which sits Eagle* City, has developed very
little pay as yet,
WOLF CREEK, a tributary- near the !
mouth, about which a good deal has j
been said this winter, has been I
prospected somewhat over its en- !
tire length. Prospects have been I
found on No. 4 above, Bounds j
& Peterson, No. 10 above, J. Brown, and
No. 23, A. Charlton. A shaft sunk on j
Discovery disclosed a three-foot vein of '
good coal. On No. 22 pup a man named !
Martin last fall struck a quartz lead at a j
depth of seven feet which Is. said to stand |
all the tests of genuineness, the seam be- â 
ing eighty-five feet wide, with granite
walls both sides, and can be traced for
one and a half miles. Assayed It ran
$40 80 to the ton. W. M. Woody, A. J.
Kelsey, S. B. Ballou and G. W. Thurston
located claims and set four men to work
uncovering the rock.
AMERICAN CREEK, its principal trib
utary, empties into Mission a few ;
miles from the mouth. The creek j
is about twenty-two miles long, !
and Discovery Is twelve miles up. I
The creek Is shallow and all summer |
diggings, but it has as yet scarcely been' \
tested. Jerry Heator owns Discovery and
two adjoining claims and Is prospecting
them. The most energy displayed Is on |
No. 2 above, owned by Lorlmar & Smith. ;
The claim has been developing pay for i
two years, and the owners expect to take
out $30,000 this summer. Something over j
$12,000 last year. The present owners
bought the claim and were assured at the ;
time by the previous owner that there '
was no pay except In the bottom of the
creek. They took his word for It and
worked out the bottom of the creek, and
after that put a holo down a little higher
up. There they struck much better pay,
getting as high as $1 a pan. .
Louis Anderson, on No. 9 above. is get-
ting still better than this. Big prepara
tions are being made by Cosky & Jensen
on No. 10 above, and by the Rasman Bros.
on No. 1G below. This is about all the
work being done on the creek.
'DISCOVERY FORK is the best tribu
tary of American so far in .Its!
history. There are about twenty -
men working on Slt and good pros- , .
pecta are found there. Thomas Welch â 
prospected and claims to have found '",
coarse gold on Union Gulch, a tributary I â¢
of Discovery Fork. - i
CHAMPION CREEK or LITTLE '
NORTH FORK- is just over 'the divide I
in the Forty-Mile country by way of '
American Creek. The creek is all staked i
out, but John Mahalclk on No. 9 built the i .
only cabin and lias sunk two holes to j I
bedrock. He claims to have got good ! !
surface prospects and will make a trior- j I
ough search for a pay streak. Roberts I
& Dubois did some .work on No. 10 above J i
the mouth, and will, after getting some j
provisions over, try again.
OLD SILVER CREEK,' slightly pros
pected on three claims, has discovered ,
very coarse gold. The same may be said ]
of Star, Bonson and Cub creeks.
COMET CREEK, Bear and Arkansas
creeks- have been' staked out but not
prospected.
EUREKA CREEK is the 'continuation
of the North Fork. Little work has been
done on It. L. A. Flint, James Boggan,
James Tuppey, George McClure, Mike W.
Krebs and Dan Powell have done more ;
prospecting near the mouth of Slate I
CreeK and have found good pay. They ;
have built a cabin, and are now engaged
in getting provisions over to enable them \
to work tho claim this summer. This Is |
Discovery. The creek is staked to eight j
below and twenty-eight above, and there
Is room for many more.
SLATE CREEK enters Eureka Creek j
at Discovery, on the latter creek. It Is j
sixty miles long. Discovery -Is twenty
miles from the mouth, and from the j
mouth to 43 above the creek Is staked and i
recorded. Prospect holes have been sunk |
at frequent intervals over this long j
stretch, and in no instance without find- j
ing coarse gold. The creek Is said to have j
developed not a single "Knocker" out of i
all the crowds who have stampeded it ,
this last winter. The creek was staked j
originally about the Fourth of last July, j
and a tributary also thoroughly staked, ;
that comes in near Discovery, Is named
Fourth of July. Discovery was made by
the Hudson brothers, Teddy and Jim.
who previously distinguished themselves
by a great slaughter of cariboo in the
winter of 1897-98, thereby getting them
selves into the newspapers. Their find,
backed by an energetic effort to get pro
visions over the divide to their claim,
started. the first stampede. There are now
about fifty men at work on the creek and
twenty well separated claims. Many
others are engaged in taking provisions
over, for the diggings are all shallow, and
the real work will be done this summer.
In fact, the town of Eagle City is now
comparatively deserted from this cause. ,
A party of nineteen, known as the Buck- \
eye boys, who own several claims, have j
thoroughly prospected No. 13 below, and
for a width across the creek of sixty feet j
they find a depth of three feet of gravel,
which pans from 6 to 40 cents. Bedrock
is eight feet deep with three feet of
muck. The Buckeye boys are Charles
Keley, manager; Sylvester Wideman, ;
James Sanderson. George Gleckler, Wil
liam Theme. William Fettle, Howard
Huntington, George Miller, Charles Smith,
Abe Mltzer, Henry Zerker, William Co
hen. J. L. and Ross Llvengood, rank At- i
tleman^ Dal Days and Patrick McCrlstal, j
all of Sandusky, and Julian L. Shay and ;
Perry Hutchlns of Dayton, Ohio. They
form the Alaska Co-operative Mining
Company, a corporation formed at ban- !
dusky, and of which James E. Sneyeley :
was manager. He fell into deep disfavor
with the company and they put him on
rations and told him to leave the coun- |
try and he did so. The company owns
twelve claims in the vicinity
Jack Mahalclk, Mike Beckler, Nicholas
Licht and XV. M. Flaherty are known as
the cariboo boys. They own Nos. 10 ana i
11 above and have the same gold, but tne |
depth of gravel Is not so great.
It is estimated that 100 men , will be I
working. -on the creek all summer if ,
enough provisions can be got over while j
the snow lasts. ;*.â: , ' - .
There will be a great deal of prospect- j
ing in the neighborhood this summer for
quartz, a number of men having claimed
to have found good Indications in several
places, especially on Jim Creek and on ;
Gold Run., Bench claims have been staked :
on Slate Creek, but the ground is by no
means covered as yet. .)''_ "c,V; I'
The principal tributaries of Slate are ;
Independence, Ruby, Fourth of July,
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year,
on ail of which the same good surface
prospects have been found, though no real
work is yet being done on any. There is ,
a vast country in here that remains to be .
prospected. Almost nothing is known of ;
the Middle Fork and all Its tributaries
These will be Invaded this summer, no \
doubt. _ _ , , , , i
BOUNDARY CREEK is a good sized
stream that flows Into the Yukon Just at ]
the boundary line. The lower half of the |
lower claim only lies in British territory. ;
About a dozen men are working there and
they claim to have found big prospects,
but' that water has troubled them -ill win
ter so that they could do little work, but i
they hope for better opoprtunlty in the
summer. v-'-v,. . < .-_â 'â¢ -." j
The district thus touched on its directly ,
tributary to Eagle City and includes a
gieat number of creeks that are wholly |
unprospected. What prospecting has been j
done on any of the creeks Is general'y of
the most superficial kind, consisting of j
the sinking of mere potholes that almost
run out before they reach bedrock. Thi.
has. not been because of a lack of inclina
tion on the part of prospectorl?, .but be
cause of an enforced hurry. On mere
prospecting tours into regions difficult of
access and distant from a base of sup- 1
plies men cannot carry great quantities
of food and therefore must do only what
they can do quickly. The whole region
remains to be really tested. Even the
coming summer will not see this done,
although the thousand men at work there j
now will see their number multiplied sev
eral times.
Till-: SEVENTY-MILE COUNTRYâ j
The Seventy-mile is a big stretch of coun
try, with on the map more creeks to the )
square inch than any other division. There j
are about a hundred men working there j
and a small settlement at the mouth. j
Nothing to cause a thrill has come out of |
Seventy-mile this winter. Twelve claims 1
are being worked on
BARNEY CREEK â Like Forty-mile
and Mission, nearly all the Seventy-mile
diggings are shallow and better worked j
during the mosquito drill. Twelve claims
are being worked or made ready.
Lee and Frohlick are the owners !
of four claims, one of which paid three I
ounces to a man last summer. The dirt 1
runs from 15 to 20 cents in 3% to 6 feet of
gravel. Powell '& Nelson are working a i
claim, and Reynolds and Runnells two
others. A. J. Freltas and V, L. Benlng- !
ton own a portion of 1000 feet at the
mouth which developed excellent pay.
FLUME CREEK enters seventy miles i
from the opposite side from Barney, the !
left going up, and some miles farther
up. Several claims were worked there
last fall, and provisions, were taken In
this winter for the summer campaign.
Claim owners in the forties say they have
made recent good finds.
Claim owners on Crooked Creek, Broken
Neck and Pleasant creeks are cheerful, '
and declare a stanch faith in their prop
erty.
There is a little bunch of creeks that
enter the Yukon in close vicinity to each
other about thirty miles below Seventy
Mile. They were staked during the throes
and enthusiasms of the late war time
and were called Dewey, Schley, Fourth
of July, McKinley and Michigan. I wrote
concerning them after my run down the
river last fall. I was unable to visit them
this time and cannot tell whether any
thing has developed in line with their
promise or otherwise. What they hold
will, however, only be delivered in the
bright summertime. Fourth of . July Is
the creek of this group that caused the
most stir last summer. It is about thirty
miles long and Discovery is half way up
Discovery was made by T. McMichaels,
and It is said he took out gold In ounces. j
Nos. 10, 11 and. 12 are owned by Van Ness,
Pennoyer and Pickenbaugh. They shov
eled sixteen days off No. 10 from a
depth of six feet and with a net result of
92 ounces. A chemist from the Armour
Packing Company went to the diggings
from Circle at the instance of Alex Mc-
Donald last October, so they say. and in
two pans got 88 and 52 cents respectively.
CHARLEY RIVERâ A number of men
are working on the tributaries of Charley
River. On Sam Creek eleven men have
been working and are said to have been
finding good pay; but some of them were
compelled to come out for lack of pro
visions. On Bonanza Creek, twelve miles
up Charley River, forty men are at work.
They' find encouraging colors, but have
not located a pay streak. .Draham Creek,
four miles from the mouth of Charley i
River, has twelve men working who claim
to have 10 and 15 cent dirt. Todd Creek.
a tributary of Draham, has developed
pay. Todd, who made the discovery,
claims to have gotten 60-cent pans with
an average of twelve.
This region from Forty Mile to Charley
River comprises many hundreds of
miles of water shed and many thousands
of possibilities for prospectors. It need
not be said that the vast area has scarce
ly been touched and' remains as an almost
unlimited opportunity to those who are
equipped physically and otherwise to In
vade It, to meet and overcome the hard
conditions it has laid upon the taking
from it what It holds. It offers oppor
tunity to these only.
My trip, which did not extend beyond
the Forty Mile. anil Mission Creek coun
tries, comprehended a Journey, of about
500 miles. 1 found excellent trails and j
road houses or miners' cabins at con- !
venient-distances for each day's travel, so ! >
is to necessitate camping out but two or I
three times on the whole trip, which cov
ered a period, of three weeks. This in I
Itself la a long stride toward the rapid !
Jevelopment of the country that has been
taken in this one yesr just past.
In the journey down the river I passed
the points, where two of the big river '
steamers are. wintering, the Arnold of the
Alaska Exploration Company back of . an i.;
sland about thirty, miles . below ; Forty 1- .
Mile and the John C. Bar in the river five j
miles below the. Arnold. The Arnold is j :
n a position that she sought, though she I .
sought it rather late in the year, when!'
she had little time to make choice. The
Bar Is lying where she was caught >. by
the ice and her position is extremely, dan
gerous. The ice has been cut around her
and her officers hope that she may have
water enough on top of the ice to enable
her to run to a more protected position
before the ice breaks and the crush
comes. The Arnold, Captain McNoble in
command, Is in comparatively safe quar
ters. As the water rises the boat will be
hauled in close back of and in the shelter
of the Island, and unless some accident
happens she will weather the storm.
The long days are gradually dissolving
the snow and the period of interrupted
communication on the river, the trails
being impassable because of rotten ice", is
at hand. This, that leaves to-day, will
perhaps be the last mall outâ the last, at
least, that starts.- with any reasonable
certainty of getting out before the river
ice breaks. The system to which the car
riage of mails has been reduced by Col
onel Steel and the Police Department
may, however, prove successful in keep
ing up. communication later than even
they themselves will guarantee. It Is
time, then, to say a word that may be
final before the clean up as to the result
of the winter's work In the Dawson dis
trict, although it be only repeating what
has been said time and again through the
winter. Conservative estimates by the
best posted people place the output of .the
Klondike and Indian River districts for
the year at from twenty to thirty mil
lions.
In the list of creeks El Dorado will still
stand" at the head with an output of five
or six millions. Bonanza, with her won
derful benches, will make a close second
with a yield of over five millions. Hunker
and Dominion will dispute for third place
with something like three and a half mil
lions each. Sulphur, which has proved
something of a disappointment, rather
because of its deep diggings, perhaps,
than because the gold Is not there, will
not turn out more than half a million.
Gold Run and Eureka creeks, which this
winter have entered the lists of good pro
ducers, and Quartz Creek, which has de
veloped better pay on the benches than
in the bottom, will each produce about a
quarter of a million. All other creeks and
benches, including Thistle Creek, Stewart
River and other independent districts con
tiguous to Dawson, may be set down. at
about half a million. El Dorado has sim
ply "kept up its lick" in turning out a
steady stream of gold. Bonanza, that
last year took on the shape of a disap
pointment, has developed in much better
form, so far as indications go, this year.
Gold in paying quantities is being taken
out as far up as the eighties above, while
the sldehils have .been a surprise and
wonder. : -.:â â : . ."â¢
Many small gulches entering Bonanza
on the left limit, that is, on the El
Dorado side, have proven big producers,
such as Monte Crlsto, American, Adams
and Victoria. The hillsides bounding
these have also discovered big pay. A
year ago they had not been prospected
and were not even staked In the great
stampeding seasonâ winter of 1897-98.
Bonanza is now being prospected all the
way, and It is not Impossible will furnish
new surprises. The benches a side
hill of the creek from Discovery to forty
below on the left limit are being bored
Into until they present the appearance
from below of a long succession of earth
works.
Tha output of Hunker this year will
greatly exceed that of last. The benches
here, too, have turned out very rich.
Last Chance, a tributary of Hunker, was
until lately little thought of, but the Bide
hills through a certain .area have been
found to contain good pay. The same is
true of Gold Bottom-, another tributary.
Dominion Creek over in the Indian
River division has had a varying expe
rience during the winter, the utmost en
thusiasm being felt in its name at times,
while at others claim owners fell Into
the blues. This Is because the pay streak
was elusive and pockety. On the whole,
however, the creek will make big returns
for the labor. The best results come from
between the discoveries and to 20 below
and 10 above upper. Work has been done
at intervals along the creeks as far down
as 200 below, and good prospects have
been found at intervals all the way and
some pay dumps will be taken out down
in the hundreds.
The diggings at Stewart River and
Thistle Creek, of which much has been
reported here during the winter, will not
advance much above the prospecting
stage, although all rounded up there will
be considerable gold come out. The
prospects at Thistle Creek and tributaries
are definite and tangible and indicate ex
cellent diggings. I have seen a pocketful
of gold that averaged in size from a grain
of wheat to a marble taken out of two
holes on one claim. There ought to be
more where it came from.
As for the other diggings at Circle
City, up the Kuyukuk and toward the
upper lakes, they are too distant for me
to venture to speak of as something that
I know about. At Circle City. I learn,
the same active operations are going on
there- that have been progressing for
some years with the same good results.
On the Kuyukuk nothing can be . looked
for this year more than the results of
prospecting, as it was invaded in num
bers only this last fall. I have, of course,
heard many reports from there, but they
vary. â ..:-.;- ' . â  . --â¢='â 'â

Secretary of the Navy Long is deeply
Interested In the result of an experiment
which Is to be made under the direction
of Captain John M. Hawley for the en
listment of 300 or 350 men In the Middle
West and West. It is believed Western
enlistments will quicken that section's in
terest in the navy.
Many inquiries have been received by
the department from the West by young
men of adventurous spirit who would like
to join the navy, but who cannot afford
the expense of traveling to New York or
Boston with the chance of rejection after
their arrival. It is proposed, therefore, to
send a recruiting officer tnrough the West
next month- to gather in 300 or 350 re
cruits. Only bright and promising Ameri
can citizens between the ages of IS and 25
will be taken. They must be able to" read
and write. Exceptional Inducements are
to be offered those recruits in the shape
of_a long cruise on Admiral Farragut's
old flagship Hartford, which is now at
the Mare Island Navy Yard. She has
been thoroughly refitted at a cost of
about $350,000. The recruits will be sent
to the receiving : ship Independence at
Mare Island for several months of pre
liminary "shaking down." and then will
embark upon the Hartford for New York
either by the way of Cape Horn or across
the Pacific to China, thence to India and
through the Red Sea and the Mediter
ranean. Her executive officer will be
Lieutenant Commander Alexander. Sharp,
a nephew of General Grant, who distin
guished himself during the recent war as
the commander of the auxiliary yacht
Vixen, which was attached to Schley's
flying squadron, In addition to the re
cruits, she will carry 150 experienced men
Upon arrival in New York the recruits
will be assigned to warships, If this ex
periment is a success, as Captain Hawley
confidently expects It to be, It will be re
peated with ; a view to the enlistment of
more Westerners. ,

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May 18.â There is trouble in
the directorate of the Light" and Power
Company of this city, and J. K. Prior of
San Francisco, one of the largest stock
holders In the concern, has resigned. He
charges mismanagement of affairs and
shoves the responsibility for this on the
shoulders of President Quilty.
Prior has been interested in the proper
ties of the company for nearly forty
years. The annual meeting of the com
pany last Saturday was stormy, and at
its close Prior resigned. No one was
elected to fill the vacancy. The remain
ing directors are: C. W. Quilty (presi
dent), J. L. Lelter, Amasa Eaton, Lloyd
Tevls, Uriah Wood and Gus Lion.
The Light and Power Company has been
a sort of gold mine to its owners until
recent years. For a long, time it had a
monopoly of the gas and electric light
business of the city at prices that were
top-notchers. Prior was a large owner
of the San Jose Gas Company, and when
it was merged Into the electric company
he got some 2000 shares. The capitaliza
tion of the Light and Power Company is
$1,000,000, and the gas company's business
went in at twelve-seventeenths of this
amount of stock. Dividends were large
and the concern enjoyed the city lighting
contracts and all other business.
The management changed, and H. J.
Edwards was deposed as superintendent.
He at once organized the Electric Im
provement Company and started in busi
ness for himself. His popularity carried
him along against the Immense capital
of the opposition, and the new company
cut into the business and dividends of the
Light and Power Company. The latter's
stock dwindled from $65 a share to $42 50
three months ago, and now it is $22 50 and
dividends have ceased. The Improvement
Company has just added a gas plant and
has reduced the price of this light from
$2 75 to $2 per thousand feet. It is now
laying pipes and has contracts ahead that
will keep its force busy for months to
come. * ,
Since this latest move the Light ana
Power Company has been seeking a con
solidation with the Improvement Com
pany. Prior was particularly anxious for
this! This combination fell through, how
ever, and he in disgust resigned. He al
leged mismanagement and declared he
would not remain a director and be re
sponsible for it. Prior is a practical man
and proved valuable in the concern's man
agement, but the smaller stockholders
combined and took affairs out of his
hands. ; ____ .;,'<Y;:

at the hour of adjournment only four of

somewhat delayed things, as there were
six candidates for the honors. The of
ficers elected were as follows: Supreme
representatives. Walker C. Graves of San
Francisco and George E. Church of
Fresno; grand chancellor. Dr. Arndt of
San Francisco; vice grand chancellor.
William T. Jeter of Santa Cruz.
The balance of the officers will be
elected at to-morrow morning's session.
The Rathbone Sisters were . also in
session and spent their time in a re
vision of the by-laws and election of of
ficers. Twenty-four laws were acted upon
and the grand chief was sustained in all
of them except two. Â.ââ

Holland of Oakland, Mrs Kratzensteii, of
Sacramento and Mrs. M. A. Welder, of
Grass Valley, was appointed to extend
a vote of thanks to members of Hermion
Temple and the citizens of Santa Cruz
for their generous hospitality.
The election of officers resulted as fol

with the exception of Mrs. Brown and
Mrs. Holmes, who were re-elected: Past

having- been shot by the Sheriff.
The mob was pacified yesterday and
during- the night only by the pleadings
of Hoxie's family, and the assurance
of the physician that the man was dy
ing- rapidly and could not survive the
day.
Yesterday the mob leaders announced
that they would not wait longer than
daylight on Friday. The doctors were
certain Hoxie would be dead by that
time, and the mob leaders assert if he
is not they will hang him.
Several members of the mob have
suggested to Hoxie'fl relatives that the
murderer commit suicide if he finds his
wounds will not result fatally, and thus
save the county the odium of having
witnessed the lynching of one of its
citizens.
Hoxie is terror-stricken and these
suggestions from the mob seem to ab
solutely paralyze him. Governor Been
hag been importuned to send troops,
but has not done so, as the Sheriff has
not called for them, and if they were
started the mob would complete its
work long before they could reach
Washington.
A thousand farmers from along the
Nebraska border are in town, all wait
ing for morning to decide what shall
be done. The authorities will make no
resistance, and unless Hoxie has the
courage to kill himself or his wounds i
prove fatal, he will probably be strung
up at daylight.
Sheriff Coleman went to Hollenburg j

fact remains that men who have been in

cisco, Boston, Philadelphia and Chicago.
The Chicago Auto-Truck Company will
have a capital of $15,000,000, the. Boston
Company of (10,000,000, the Philadelphia
Company of $10,000,000 and the San Fran-
cisco Company of $5,000,000. The Inter-
national Power Company will own the
controlling interest in the stock of all
these concerns, but the management will
' be lodged in the hands of local capitalists.
The one to be organized in San Fran
' cisco will have the exclusive rights to
operate auto-trucks in California. Joseph
Deiter, who is largely interested in the
power company, said to-day that they
' were not vet ready to give out the names ;
of the promoters in the several States. It
is hoped to start companies just as soon
ias the auto-trucks are ready. Tests are
. being made at Worcester and efforts will
I be made to put one thousand in operation
here and at Chicago right at the start.
I A little later a number will be sent on
i to San Francisco.
Howard P. Taylor, a well-known mem
ber of the Olympic Club of San Francis
i co. has been ln New York for some time
making arrangements with the Interna
tional Power Company for San Francisco,
and it Is said that he has been successful j
in the matter. He Is about to start for
: home and will proceed to Incorporate a
company on his arrival, having already
Interested a number of capitalists in the
proposed enterprise.
Mr. Taylor came on from San _ ran-
cisco with letters of introduction from
Henry J. Crocker, J. 08. Gunn, Paris
: Kilbum. and other well-known San Fran
ciscans and was Introduced to the auto-
truck people by Mr. de Young, who had

GUARDING ST. PATRICK'S
CHURCH AND RECTORY
Parishioners Determined to Prevent
the Entrance of Vicar General
Cluse.
ST. LOUIS. May IS.â The crowd of Irish
parishioners that has been guarding St.
Patrick's Church and rectory in East
St. Louis. 111., for the past forty-eight
hours to prevent the entrance of Vicar
General Clause, the newly appointed Ger
man priest. Is. still on duty. This morn
ing the church was unlocked long enough
to hold mass and then relocked and
barred and will be kept so. the parishion
ers assert, until the trouble is settled.
They want an Irish priest and declare
they will not permit Father Cluse, a
German, to take charge of the parish.
The grounds of the church were pa
trolled all day, and to-night a relief guard
went on duty. It has been arranged that
as soon as Father Cluse appears the big
bell of the church will be sounded and the
3000 members of the parish will turn out
prepared to resist the priest's entry into
the church or rectory, it is not known
whether Father Cluse will make an effort
to fill his new appointment. One of the
prominent parishioners said to-day that
the committee that went to Washington
to see Monsignor Martlnelll had received
his assurances that he would suspend the
appointment of Father Cluse until the
matter. could be investigated. Others are
afraid, however, that the German priest
will take charge of the church if they do
not guard against it closely.

PHOTOGRAPHS ME
TAKEN IN COLOR
No Longer a Doubt of
Success.
â¦ â
â * â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK*, May IS.â A Chicago spe
cial to the Herald says: Charles N.
Crewdson of the Chicago Society of
Egyptian Research has returned to the
city with the first color photographs ever
: taken of Egyptian scenes. Isochromatie
| plates and the McDonough process of
color photography were the means of his
j achievement.
Mr. Crewdson left Chicago early in the
winter and went directly to London.
thence to Alexandria and finally reached
Cairo, with a thousand plates. Mrs.
Crewdson accompanied him. Their plan
was to avoid the beaten paths of travel,
liv.- among the natives and work with
their cameras among Egyptian ruins.
They succeeded, despite innumerable ac-
cidents to their plates, and brought back
with them the first collection of Egypt
; ian photographs in true colors ever pro
' duced.
The two hundred plates with -which -Mr.
Crewdson returned sustain the accuracy
of the statements of the late James XV.
McDonough' and demonstrate that color
photography is an accomplished fact.
Mr. Crewdson exhibited a large number
of these plates to-day, and they were rev
elations in beauty, marvels of landscape,
sunsets, cloud effects and shadows, each
In color just as presented when the cam
era did its work.
"In three months' work In Egypt," said
Mr. Crewdson. "I have succeeded in do
ing what artists have failed to do for
years, and the result of my work, crude
as It is, but perfect in what was attempt
ed. is now ready for inspection by all
people. I hope to return to Egypt next
winter and to continue this work there.
For the art and the educational world
the result of this trip is certain in time
to be of inestimable value."
! 'wight K. Tripp, whose belief In the
art of color photography led to Mr.
t*rewdson's trip and the color work, said:
"The end Justifies all that has been
claimed for the discoveries of McDonough.
Egypt was the field in which if color pho
tography -was ever to fail It would fall.
That it did not fail, but instead has given
us photographs such as never existed be
fore. is but evidence that a revolution in
art and science is coming through the use
of the color, camera."
RECOVERED INTELLECT
AFTER FIFTY THREE YEARS
Strange Injury to a Mexican War
Veteran Restores Him to His
. Former State.
TOLEDO. Ohio, May Mathias Stein
berger, who lives with relatives on a
farm in Jackson Township, a few miles
out of Fostoria, has recovered his mem
ory and intellect after a lapse of fifty
three years. He Is a veteran of the Mex
ican war and was a member of Payne's
Regiment of Pennsylvania cavalry. His
regiment participated in the battle of
Resaca de la Palma. While riding at the
head of a company his horse stumbled
and fell. He was thrown violently over
the animal's head, striking upon his own
head upon a pile of rocks. He immedi
ately lost consciousness and for a time
his spine appeared to he affected. From
that time he has been scarcely what
might be termed an idiot, yet he was of
no value to himself or anybody else.
During this long -period of mental aber
ration he has frequently said he was 21
years of age and that at the next elec
tion he Intended to vote for General Tay
lor for President. While watching some
workmen saw wood with a buzz saw yes
terday near his home he was struck on
the head with a piece of flying wood and
knocked senseless. He did not recover
for some time, but when he regained his
faculties he had completely recovered the
powers he had lost over half a century
ago. V:
MISHAPS CAUSE THE
BARBAROSSA TO RETURN
Fire in the Steamer's Hold Followed
by a Collision and Sinking of
Barges.
NEW YORK. May 18.â The North Ger
man Lloyd steamship Barbarossa, which
sailed for Southampton and Bremen- at
11 o'clock this morning, was discovered
on fire while she was passing Sandy Hook
two hours later, and put bacK to port. The
fire was in the forward hold. , The Bar
barossa fought the fire with steam and
water, and with the aid of wrecking tugs
and fire boats drowned it out two hours
later while lying at quarantine.
The vessel while on her way up the
river after the fire in her hold had been
put out hit the French liner La Bretagne,
lying in her pier in the North River, shov
ing the Bretagne'fl bow through .two Ice
barges, the Richard Foster and the Leroy,
sinking them. No one was injured.
The cargo in the Barbarossa's forehold
will have to be discharged before the ves
sel resumes her voyage, but It is hoped
that the steamship will be able to sail
to-morrow. The Barbarossa carried ' 487
passengers. After the flames had been
subdued and the Barbarossa tied up at
her pier in Hoboken many of the passen
gers . came ashore.

Fleet May W, the Calgary mystery, is
one of the favored horses of fortune.
Don Cameron's breadwinner was assigned

yesterday and was rightfully Installed a
9-to-10 favorite. Accorumg to the pro

McGibben announced in the ring that
May XV had been given the. outside posi
tion. On her back was Bill Dingley, the
Montana wizard. At the post Dingley
yanked the mare about some lengths
back of the 'barrier and then suddenly
made a dart for the webbing. Intuition
seemed to tell Starter Caldwell to re
lease the harrier. He did, and the field
chased her home. 'Rosormonde in a hard
drive took the place from Genua. ;Y-.Y:
Jenkins easily outclasses the balance of
the riding talent, placing four winners
over the plate. The young man evidently
rejected the tempting proposals made by
the Gravediggers' Consolidated Union, for
he lands (lrst on favorites and outsiders
alike. Four choices succeeded in captur-
ing purses. â RSPHQgggfc.B
The good colt Bamboulia made a gallop

SLOT MACHINES.
Judge Sweeney of Redding Says They
Should Not Be Protected Against
Counterfeit Coins.
The decision of Judge Sweeney of the
Superior Court of Redding in the case
of W. N. Wood, arrested in Keswick for
playing lead imitations of nickels in a
slot machine, was the subject of consider
able comment in the Federal building yes
terday. . Judge Sweeney decided that as
the State statute under which the prison
er was prosecuted did not include nickel
coin as a subject of unlawful â¢ counter
feiting, there was nothing to hold the
prisoner.
Secret Service Agent Browne said that
if Wood had been prosecuted under the
Federal statute he would have been con
victed, because the Federal statute
names "gold, silver, nickei. copper and
other coins," whereas the State statute
names only gold and silver. That part
of Judge Sweeney's decision in which he
said that the State did not intend to
make laws for the protection of gambling
machines, by which he meant nickel-in
the-slot contrivances, caused considerable
excitement among saloon men and cigar
dealers who have . machines which pay
only cigars and drinks to the winner, and
which they claim are not gambling de
vices, being intended only to Increase the
sale of drinks and cigars, and usually
coming out even at the end of the day.

THE appeal in the suit of Jack Davis against J. E. Burke, Sheriff of 1

SYSTEMATIC STREET REPAIRING.
WHAT appears to be a good solution of the
problem of street repairing is contributed to
the current number of the Merchants' Asso
ciation Review by L. M. King, superintendent of the
association. The proposal is that the city be divided
into districts for street repair work, and that the work
in each district be carried on continuously. Mr. King
says:
"Suppose that instead of the present uncertain
method of repairing streets, the city were divided into
districts, each containing, say, one mile of basalt
block or cobble pavement, and that to each district
were assigned a man who would be made responsible
for putting his district in repair and keeping it in re
pair thereafter. Each man would work continually
in his respective district. He would first go over the
district gradually repairing the worst holes and after
ward turn his attention to the minor holes and de
pressions and replacing badly worn or uneven blocks.
To place his district in repair would at first take some
time, probably six months or a year in some parts of
the city, but, once in repair, it would be comparatively
easy to keep it in that condition, provided he was con
stantly at work there. A small supply of sand, gravel
and a few paving blocks would have to be kept at
some place in each district.''
The advantages to be expected from such a system
are that street repair work would be carried on upon
all cobble or basalt â  paved streets simultaneously;
immediate attention would be given to complaints
and special repairs made at once; the yearly amount
of money required for street repairs could be more
accurately calculated for the tax levy, and the street
repair force would be a permanent body of workmen
who would soon acquire skill and efficiency in the
business.
The suggestion merits the careful attention of the
municipal authorities. It is full time some adequate
system of street repairing was adopted and put into
operation.
UNSATISFIED BOSTON.
ALTHOUGH the present tariff was drawn up by
a committee presided over by a New England
man, Mr. Dingley, and was revised by a Sen
ate committee presided over by another New Eng
ender, Senator Aldrich, and was designed to give
New England interests at least as much protection as
was accorded to those of any other section of the
Union, Boston is not satisfied. There comes from
her people a demand for a repeal of the duty on
hides.
It is not free-traders who have started the demand,
but the New England Shoe and Leather Association,
and the Boston Journal declares "New England pro
tectionists will pretty solidly sympathize with them."
It is said a determined effort will be made at the
coming session of Congress to bring about a repeal
of the duty. The argument of the opponents of the
duty is that hides are a by product and that a duty
upon them is not necessary for the protection of the
cattle industry. It was on that ground the fight was
made against the hide duty when first proposed, and
the new movement merely revives the old con
troversy.
From a New England standpoint the repeal is of
course much to be desired. Comparatively few hides
are produced in that section and a great many shoes
are manufactured there. In fact, the output of boots
and shoes is so large that an enormous and increasing
export trade is carried on in the business. Thus the
manufacturers wish cheap raw materials, and from
their point of view there is nothing to justify the hide
duty. It is one of the cases where the local interest
of one section is opposed to the local interest of
another.
It is not likely, however, that Congress will give
much heed to the demand for the repeal of the duty.
It was not placed upon the tariff until after full and
fair consideration of the interests of all parts of the
Union. American raw material is as much entitled to
protection as American manufactured goods. No
better argument can be given for protecting the shoe
industry of Boston than for protecting the cattle in
dustry of the West. That view of the subject was
taken by the Congress that enacted the tariff, and it
is fairly certain that if an attempt is made to ma
terially change any of the schedules there will arise
a demand for wholesale revision, and a general tariff
debate will be precipitated.
The Journal itself concedes that while the tariff in
jures New England industry in one point, that injury
is outbalanced a hundred times by benefits which the
tariff bestowed. Such being the case, it is to be
hoped the shoe and leather men will not be encour
aged in trying to bring about a change in it. This
country will not/ be in a mood for further tariff
tinkering for many a year to come.

A MONUMENT FOR DEWEY.
\A AYOR PHELAN has given a prompt and
/ \ favorable response to the suggestion of The
* ' â ' * Call that he appoint a committee to take
charge of the work of raising money for the purpose
of erecting in this city a monument to Admiral
Dewey. The committee, to be appointed to-day, will
soon organize and set about its task, and there can be
little doubt that it will find the public cordially re-
sponsive to the enterprise.
/ By reason of the duties which his office is likely to
impose upon him in the future, the home of the Ad
miral will of necessity be in the East at the national
capital. His most notable monument, however,
should be on this coast, for his victory was. a Pacific
Ocean event, and its most notable effects will be vis
ible in the expanding commerce and growing su
premacy of the United States on that ocean to whose
waters San Francisco is the nation's' chief gateway.
While there will be liberal contributions made in
California to the Eastern movement undertaken to
provide a mansion for the Admiral, such donations
will be so small a part of the sum raised they will not
fairly represent Western gratitude and admiration for
the hero. In fact, they will be lost sight of in the
larger giving of the East, and California and her sis
ter States of the coast will get comparatively little
credit for what is given in that way. A monument
in this city, however, would be unmistakably a West
ern manifestation of honor to the hero, and would
therefore reflect full credit upon those by whose
energy, patriotism, and liberality it was raised.
It is hardly necessary to point out to the people of
San Francisco and of California the debt of gratitude
they owe to Dewey for the promptness with which he
destroyed the Spanish fleet, crushing the naval power
of Spain in the Pacific and thus removing at once all
fear of assault upon our commerce and all menace to
our coast cities. Rarely has any community in. time
of war been more promptly or more signally freed
from all possibility of danger by a single great mili
tary achievement than was this city by the glorious
triumph of Manila Bay.
It is certain that had a movement been started last
May to provide a monument for Dewey the money
would have been subscribed within a week. Such was
the ardor and the enthusiasm of the people at the
time. That excitement is gone, but the deeper senti
ments of honor and gratitude remain. To these the
monument committee will appeal. They will ask the
people no more than to join in a movement toward
erection in this city of a memorial which will be a per
petual reminder of the feelings of patriotism and loy
a!ty\vhich animate this generation, and to such an
appear there can be but one response on the part of
the liberal and the loyal.
AGRICULTURE IN ALASKA.
WHILE the Alaskan boom has presented some
glowing views of agricultural as well as mining
possibilities, the. outer world may well be
skeptical concerning them. Even the Alaskans them
selves doubt them, and the newspapers which are now
representing the Territory are far from being in ac
cord on the subject.
A late issue of the Alaska Dispatch of Juneau, for
example, contains an account of a speech recently de
livered before the Alaska Geographical Society by
Bishop P. T. Rowe, from which it appears the
Bishop takes quite a sanguine view of the subject.
He is quoted as having said that along the Yukon, in
the region around Nulato, cranberries are found in
abundance, also blue berries, salmon berries and red
currants. Potatoes, turnips, lettuce, beets and peas
are grown. The Bishop ate green peas at Nulato.
He mentioned these things as showing the possible
resources in the land of the midnight sun. Grass at
the mission grows from four to six feet high, and at
Fort Selkirk he saw potatoes growing, but they have
to be protected from the frosts. The winters are
not much longer than in Northern Michigan, but the
moss varies from six to eight inches in depth and it
keeps the frost in the ground.
The same paper reports Professor C. C. Georgesen,
who has had charge of the governmental investiga
tions into the agricultural possibilities of Alaska, as
saying: "My efforts were successful, even beyond ex
pectations. I succeeded in growing a long line of
early vegetables to a perfection not often excelled in
the States, and. in addition, in maturing oats, barley
and flax, all of first-class quality, although none of
these things were seeded until the latter part of May.
Grass and clover of various kinds grew prodigiously
from seed, and proved beyond doubt the adaptation
of the soil and climate for the growth of forage for
cattle. Oats attained a height of over five feet and
matured a quality seldom equaled." The same is true
of barley. Fiber flax grew more than a yard tall and
matured seed fully."
Such statements as those in the Dispatch are likely
to encourage people who wish a free farm in the land
, of the aurora borealis, but the Alaska Miner, pub
lished in the same city, gives a strong warning to all
who think of entering upon the venture. Comment
ing upon an advertisement in a paper in St. Louis
offering inducements to persons to purchase Govern-
ment land in Alaska, the Miner says it is nothing
short of an attempt to defraud the public, and adds:
"How often are we to say that this is not a country of
farms, that its resources are of a mining and not of
an agricultural nature? The Government has an
agent now at Sitka who is experimenting with a yoke
of oxen. He is attempting to prove that a crop of
some kind or other can be raised. There are indi
vidual spots in Alaska where cereals can be raised,
and Kodiak Island is pretty well covered with grass,
but does this constitute a farming district? If it is a
fact that crop failures are unknown it is because there
have never been any crops to fail."
The conclusion of the whole matter is: Alaska is
a pretty good place to stay out of unless you have
money enough to burn to keep you warm while there
and some left to come home on after having had
enough of the experience.
A "NEW IRELAND" PROGRAMME.
ACCORDING to a special correspondent of the
London Chronicle, the effect of the self-
government acquired by the counties of Ire-
land under the new act will be the inauguration of a
â  "New Ireland" movement which will be directed
I toward industrial development as much as toward
! political home rule. His claim is that while the
! county governments cannot themselves directly ac
â  complish what is desired, they nevertheless furnish
organized official bodies to lead the people in the
struggle for the desired improvements.
. The programme as outlined is a most extensive one.
The correspondent points out that by-reason of the
fact that farmers in other countries have been ma
terially aided by their Governments in improving their
methods of agriculture, while the Irish farmers have
had no such aid, the rural industries of Ireland have
been well nigh destroyed. The result is the British
market imports from foreign lands much that ought
to be obtained from Ireland.
j In a review of the situation the writer says: "It
1 only wants the teaching and the start. Three million

acres might be replanted with forests, such as once
covered the whole island. In twenty-five years they
would yield an enormous profit, like the Landes in
France. At least one and a half minion acres of the
six million waste land might be reclaimed for agri
culture. Fisheries could be developed; the Celtic
Cornishmen and Bretons are among the best fishers
of the world. ' Home arts and industries are particu
larly suited for Celtic taste and skill in handicraft.
Ireland's immense water power might be utilized as
in Switzerland. As it is, the crops and stock alone are
valued at Â£112,000,000. To say that this might easily
be doubled with encouragement and instruction is a
low estimate."
â¢ Most of the work comprehended in the programme
was recommended some years ago by a committee
appointed by Parliament to examine and report upon
Irish conditions. This commission, known as "the
recess committee," gathered a large amount of in
formation from all classes of the Irish people and
strongly urged governmental action along the lines
indicated. Nothing, however, was done. Now that
the county government act has placed local admin
istration under the control of the Irish people, a fight
for the reforms is likely to be taken up in earnest.
The Chronicle's correspondent says: "Probably
one of the first aims of the new councils or their dele
gates will be to establish a central body of agricul
tural direction, intelligence and instruction such as
the recess committee advised. I do not see how it
would be possible for the English Government to re
fuse assistance. Irish members are continually voted
down, but if the local bodies are to have no voice in
the larger Irish questions, let us drop the farce of
representation altogether. We have ground Ireland
between contradictory systems â a garrison without
guidance, and representation without redress. Let us,
at all events, be honest in the system we have granted
at last."
THE CUBAN SITUATION.
THE opinionof many army officers that trouble
is ahead in Cuba seems to be backed by events
in the island.
The recognition by Congress of the freedom and
independence of Cuba, in the declaration of war
against Spain, was accepted in good faith by the Cu
ban leaders, and they no doubt expect us to abide by
it. So far there is no indication that our Government
intends, to do any such thing. The whole island is
under rigid military government, and the American
Captain General is appointing all the civil officers,
even to the members of the judiciary. The habits of
the people, even to their costume, are dictated from
our military headquarters, and the stores and business
places are opened and closed by order of the com
mander. It was contended by Foraker, Money, Mor
gan, Mason, Lewis, Dolliver and other members of
the House and Senate, only a year ago, that there was
an organized Cuban government in operation and
capable of discharging international obligations. If
such a government existed, it has been superseded by
a military establishment exported to the island from
this country. That establishment has ordered the dis
arming of the Cuban people, and they are to be de
prived of the means of resistance, of defense and
offense. . ; " .
Nothing is given out by the administration as to the
termination of this autocracy in Cuba. No steps are
being taken to permit the people there to meet and
discuss the preliminaries of self-government. Indeed,
every attempt on their part to do so is already treated
as "seditious," and it is probable that a general move
ment to realize the expectation of independence which
we encouraged a year ago would be treated as rebel
lion against the United States, and the hopes of the
Cubans for liberty would join those of the Filipinos
in the limbo of lures and lights held out to attract
confidence and betray it.
The prospect is that our military occupation will
continue indefinitely. The longer it exists the less
fit will the people be found for self-government. Mili
tary rule is the most offensive form of government
and the most disastrous to the manhood of a people
who are its victims. Disarming the Cubans reduces
them to abject helplessness. They must submit to
military dictation or take the consequences. While
such rule is bad for them, it is worse for the people
in whose name it is put upon them. If any man had
charged, a year ago, that to-day this republic would
be exercising military autocracy over nearly twenty
millions of men in the Philippines, Ladrones and
West Indies, and that a protest of the victims would
be made powerless by disarming them, he would have
been hotly denounced as a slanderer of his country.
But we are doing it, and the fashion grows to call the
victims our "subjects," and yell "treason" at all
Americans who flinch at the spectacle.
The imperialist plan is undoubtedly to organize a
pretended government in Cuba, by and by, in which
the patriots and the people have no representation,
and use it only to go through the forms of annexa
tion. The success of a like scheme in Hawaii has in
spired the enemies of the rights of man everywhere.
and it is pitiful that they are strong enough to bring
in sight such a miserahle outcome of all our altruistic
professions toward Cuba.
But it is regarded as of more importance that the
sugar mills shall grind cane than that the aspirations
of a people for liberty shall be promoted. .The to
bacco crop is greater than this country's sense of
honor, which should impel every man to keep faith
with Cuba and the world.
We have to go back nearly eight centuries to find
a case in history that equals this.
When a revolutionary minority in Ireland accepted
the assistance of Henry of England they soon found
themselves and their enemies the slaves of the com
mon oppressor, who had come to them as an unself
ish friend and became at once an unfeeling tyrant.
That was the beginning of centuries of misrule in Ire
land under which the people groan to this day. Men
who believe that the weak have rights which the
strong should respect will have reason to hope that
the examples of Ireland and Cuba will have no future
imitators.
, C. P. Huntington, in criticizing an open letter of
condemnation by Senator John. J. Boyce, says he is
not inclined to hold the, State legislator responsible
even for his own utterances. Nobody would expect
Collis to do so after the secret of the Blackstock re
port was exposed. There is a very serious doubt that
Huntington knows that he has replied to Boyce. .
â  Oora Paul may derive' some credit from the dis
covery of another British plot to overthrow his re
public, and may receive a vote of thanks from his
people, but it is safe to say he will not get another
letter from the Kaiser. William has had several sec
ond thoughts since the first one.
Ex-Governor Boutwell of Massachusetts says he
will bring back the volunteer American armies from
the Philippines by a vote of the people. The ex-
Governor had better hasten the vote or the climate
of our new possessions will register a claim of death.

INTERESTING MEETING AT THE
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE,
*
Delegates to the Convention of the
Association of American Agri-
cultural Colleges and Ex*
periment Stations.
On July 5, 6 and 7 the Association i
of American Agricultural Colleges
and Experiment Stations will meet in
annual convention in this city. A
preliminary meeting was held yester
day for the purpose of arranging for
the reception of the learned scientists
on their arrival and with a view to
on their arrival and with a view to
making them the guests of the State.
A meeting of representatives from the ;
various commercial organizations of this
city was held in t.je rooms of the Cham
ber of Commerce yesterday afternoon for
the purpose of discussing the proper
means of raising money for the entertain
ment of the members of the Association
Of American Agricultural ' Colleges and
Experiment Stations, who will hold their j
annual convention here in July. There
were present Charles Nelson, president of
the Chamber of Commerce; S. Prentis
Smith of the Bank of California, Profes
sor M. E. Jaffa of the University of Cali
fornia, Local Weather Forecaster Alex
ander McAdie, E. A. Denlcke of the Me
chanics' Institute, Edward Goodwin,
manager of the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association, and Julian Sonntag.
A number of others who had been in
vited to meet were unable to attend. P.
N. Lllienthal of the Anglo-Callfornian
Bank, one of the absentees, sent his re
grets, but promised to aid the movement,
as he was in full sympathy with It.
After waiting. a half hour in the hope
that Mayor Phelan would put In. an ap
pearance Captain Nelson called the meet
ing to order, lie stated the object of the
conference and called attention to the :
Inestimable value to be derived by the
State from the visit of the organisation,
â which is composed of the scientific men j
of. the country, who are engaged- in in- |
vestigating all matters pertaining to
agriculture. â¢
An informal discussion then took place
on the amount of money to defray the ex- :
penses of a ten days' jaunt through the ,
State of the delegates to the convention.
During the talk it was said that the !
Southern Pacific Railroad had offered to !
furnish a train and locomotive for one
dollar a mile. Although that price wai
extremely low, it was thought the big
corporation might be prevailed on to re
duce Its price to even a less amount. It
was also stated that Mr. Foster of the
North Pacific Coast Railroad would give
the scientists free transportation over his |
road. An effort will be immediately marie
to collect $3000 to defray railroad and
other expenses. It is thought that the
residents of the towns through which the
distinguished visitors pass will fittingly
entertain them.
The meeting adjourned until Tuesday
next at 3 o'clock, when it is hoped thcie
will be a larger attendance. Secretary
Scott of the Chamber of Commerce was
Instructed to, invite land owners and cap
italists throughout the State to be pres
ent, and as they are vitally interested it
is believed they will do so.
The purpose of the committee is to have
the scientists ride tnrough the State after
their convention adjourns, so that they
can better learn of its agricultural ad
vantages, v.*. â :â â

KILL THE BUNNIES.
Two Congressmen, a Mayor, a Lady

Members of the Or-
ganization.
The subject of whether or not the So
! ciety for the i Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals should take a hand to prevent
coursing in the parks in and near this j
city was liberally discussed yesterday at |
j a meeting of the board of directors of the ,
! organization. While no decision was act
i ually taken the prevailing opinion seemed
! to be in favor of the advocates of cours
! ing. The question was brought up by the !
j receipt of a communication from the :
j coursing clubs of the lower counties ask
! ing that the board rescind its reso-
S lution of two years ago which authorized
| Secretary Holbrook to stop anything bor
-1 dering upon cruelty in the coursing parks.
i Some of the coursing men had learned
I that the matter was to be discussed and
William Halpin and H. A. Deckelman ap
peared to represent *.he sport.
The latter made a pointed plea in the
! cause which he represented. He called
i attention. to the methods employed in the
i big rabbit drives in the San Joaquin Val
-1 ley and said that the cruelty of the men ,
i on these occasions is manifest to all. The ;
! well-conducted coursing park eliminated |
all of the cruel features. The hounds are i
trained to kill their game instantly and, ;
! what is more, this same training gives ;
I them experience for killing the hares on ]
the plains in a more humane manner than j
1 the human hunters who participate in the j
big drives. According to his estimate ;
about 5000 hares are killed In each^park
I every year. In all parts of this State ;
i these animals are regarded as pests, the ;
1 same as in Australia.
The question, of the effect of the sport j
I upon the people was discussed, some ar- j
guing that it tends to make the young fa- j
miliar with .brutal scenes and less sensi
tive to the suffering of animals. Dr. Clin- :
ton said that his objection to the sport |
was the gambling feature, which leads |
many a person from, the paths of hon- ;
I esty. Colonel Jackson stated that if the |
i manner of killing hares is cruel he would ;
I not favor coursing, but from all that he
I can learn the fleeing animals are killed I
the instant they are "struck" by the ;
hounds. lie regards the hare as a pest
and that it should be exterminated. While ;
. he does not favor the gambling feature ]
I still he said that he cannot forget that
every hare killed, wherever It may be,
is one less pest In the State. Officer
Hooper, who attends all of the coursing i
matches, said that the killing of the hares ;
by the hounds is not cruel, death result-
ing quickly when the hare is caught. Di-
rector Hyde also is anything but a friend
of the rabbit, and he called attention to |
the fact that the society's mission is not i
! to. make a crusade against the vice of i
1 gambling, but to prevent animals from ,
I being abused. This seemed to be the view j
of the board and the decision was to keep
its hands off all features not provided for
In its declared principles. However, the
whole board will visit the parks at some
I convenient time and determine as to the
1 amount of cruelty involved in the hounds
. killing the hares. ''â¢'â :."
It was a matter of much gratification
to the members of the board to elect a
number of applicants of eminence in the
political, business and social world.
Among them is Mayor Phelan. who be-
came a life member. Congressman J. G.
Maguire. Congressman Julius Kahn, Mrs.
Clara Foltz and Prince XV. Poniatowski,

Monterey Carries Away
Her Main Boom. . -
The Alaska Commercial Company's re
modeled steamer Bertha is now almost
ready for the Klondike season. Last year
she was one of the smallest vessels of
the company's fleet; now she Is a first
class ocean-going steamer and the equal
of anything owned by the corporation.
The Bertha was built at Benicia in 1888, j
and up to a few months ago she was 140 ,
feet long. Now she is 193 feet long, with
the same beam and depth of hold she j
had when she was launched. To accom- '
plish this change all the spars, machinery >
and boilers were taken out of the vessel
and the hull placed on the ways of Ala- |
meda. Then the structure was sawed
clean in half and a section fifty-three feet
long put in. While making the alterations
a vigilant lookout was kept, but not an
unsound piece of timber was found, and
structurally the Bertha is a stouter ship
than on the day she was launched.
There are thirteen staterooms on the
upper deck of the remodeled steamer. All
of those aft the smokestack are supplied
with folding doors, so that two rooms
can be thrown "into one almost the entire
width of the ship. A Klondike king re
turning from the Yukon or Cape Nome
can thus have his ideas of lavish expen
diture gratified. The berths in one room
can be removed and in a few moments it
would be furnished as a sitting-room.
The folding door can be thrown open and
he would have us luxurious a bedroom
and sitting-room as he would get on an
Atlantic liner. There are also eight state
rooms on the main deck, and, all in all,
the Bertha will have accommodation for
ninety-six cabin and a hundred steerage
passengers.
The Bertha is fitted throughout with
electricity and all the latest appliances.
The dining-room can accommodate sixty
four passengers at one sluing. The smok- ;
ing-room and social hall will be as com- !
fortable as money can make them, while :
the comfort of the officers and men has
a" so been looked after. Four lights have
been made In the forecastle and the sall
ors will now be happy, as they will not
only have light but also plenty of lockers.
New boilers and engines have been put
in the steamer, and when she has her
trial In a few days twelve knots is ex
pected from her. Before she was length- ;
ened the Bertha was doing well when she i
got away with 500 tons of freight. Now !
she can carry a thousand tons and over.
Shipping men Interested in the Kotze
bue Sound district are wondering why it
is that no news has come out from that
section this year. Several firms made ar-
Irangements to have a messenger sent out ,
and C. L>. Lane, the millionaire mine
owner, engaged a man who knows tha
country well especially to bring him news. ;
None uf these men have come out as far
as the general public knows, and not a ,
word of authentic news has arrived from
the thousand men who went to Kotzebue.
The party of men sent up by Mr. Lave
are still there, and whether they have
found gold or not nobody knows unless
perhaps Mr. Lane himself. That gentle
man still has supreme faith in the Kotze- I
Lue Sound district He has purchased the â 
schooner Vega on Puget Sound and is
now loading her with lumber, coal and
supplies. .Last week he purchased the |
steamer Townsend here and la loading her
with supplies. Out at the Potrero he is |
having a light-draft river steamer built,
and as soon as she is completed a start ;
will be made for Kotzebue.
The story that came via Tacoma of
starvation on the Kubuck River is ;
laughed at here. There were three stores
on the Sound and over 1500 tons of provi- j
sions in them last October, besides the
two years' supplies that each miner took
up with him. The natives also* were un
usually well supplied with dried salmon,
so that there can be no fear of a scarcity.
From Kotzebue to the Koyukuk River,
where it was known gold was to be found,
was only a short journey over the snow,
and yet none of the men who went up on .
the Alaska, Northern Light, Jane A.
Falkenberg, Catherine Sudden and other ,
vessels have gone over there. In fact, no '
one knows or will know what they have
done until some time in July. Neverthe
less C. D. Lane is going up again with
I lots of supplies and a complete outfit.
The British ship Loudon Hill, now out
139 days from Antwerp, is likely to make.;
a. long passage. She sailed on December ;
>, and on January 5 passed Flushing. On ;
in ordinary run she would now be classed
among the vessels expected, but judging j
by the showing made on the first thirty- 1
four days of the voyage she will not get |
nere for another month. '-.. "-
The schooner Monterey had to put back
to port yesterday. Wednesday last she

cused of having defrauded the city of i
several thousand dollars by means of
forged demands on the city treasury. The
proposed action of the jury is the direct
result of the recent acquittal of McGlade
by a jury in the Superior Court. The '
fact of his guilt appears to the authori
ties to be so patent that they propose to
leave no stone unturned to secure his con
viction. His acquittal by a jury on one
of the charges brought against him Is â 
held to have been a miscarriage of jus- j
tice, and it is the ' Intention of the au- j
thorities to secure several indictments
against him and to force him to defend j
himself on each of the counts.
The specific accusations under investi
gation by the Grand Jury yesterday were
,the alleged forging of the names of C. J. I
Sullivan and Nealy Murphy to salary
warrants which were cashed *y McGlade
at the city treasury. Both Sullivan and j
Murphy were witnesses before the jury, j
and when shown the warrants to which
their names were attached both swore
positively that the signatures were for
geries. Both men testified at they had
never been in the employ of the Street
Department, and that they had never
authorized McGiade to sign their names i
to warrants or any other documents. â 
Thomas Maglnnia and John Ryan, clerks
In tiie office of the Board of Supervisors.
testified as to what they knew of the pre
sentation of the bogus warrants. Ex-Su
perintendent of Streets Ambrose testi
fied that neither Sullivan nor Murphy
were ever employed by him, and that he
had never authorized McGlade to draw
warrants in their favor..
By far the most damaging testimony
was given by Karl Eiscnschimmel. the
expert on handwriting. After making a
critical comparison of the handwriting of
the forged signatures and the known i
handwriting of McGlade he testified posi
tively that both signatures had been writ
ten by McGlade. His testimony was so
positive and his comparisons so convinc
ing that the members of the jury ex
pressed themselves as satisfied that the
signatures were forgeries, and that Mc-
Glade was the forger. -.â 'â  Y-"^ j
'lade will be indicted on each of
the charges, and if such a course shall bo
deemed necessary other Indictments will

Too Lazy to Live.
An Inquest was held yesterday morning
on the body of Louis Sauret, who cut his
throat the day before at his wife's lodg
ing-house, 130 Second street. The testi
mony of his widow shows that he was
disgracefully lazy and insisted not only
that she should support him out of her
earnings but garb him In raiment of sur
passing beauty and keep his stomach dis

The Question Again Threshed Out in
the Case of J. H. Wilson, Pro-
prietor of the Palace
1 Saloon.
The selection of a jury to try the case
of J. 11. Wilson, charged with conducting
a percentage game if poker in the Pal
ace saloon, 837 Market street, on the night
of April 24. was concluded yesterday af- j
ternoon In Judge Graham's court after
three afternoons had been almost wasted
to accomplish that end. The Jurors se
lected are: A. Thayer, August A. Schau,
Louis Kuh, Albert H. Menne, Theodore !
E. Schottler, Claus Claussen, XV. J. Gal- i
lagher. Joe _. Knowles, William Shultz, i
Albert Mautz, H. M. Devine and J. P. Mc- |

, The first witness called was Policeman
, George Eastman and during his examlna- |
' tion by Prosecuting Attorney Wentworth
Attorney Ach, for the defendant, objected
to all questions put to the Witness,
which were, as a rule, overruled by the
Judge. At one â¢ time Ach objected to a |
question us being leading and in an au
thoritative manner ordered the Judge to
i Instruct the prosecuting attorney to be
I more careful. This called forth a hot re- j
tort from Wentworth, who said:
"I know my business without receiving
| Instructions from Mr. Ach. There are a
; whole lot of things he does here that he
' knows are not proper and I object to be- ]
ing criticized by him."
At another time Ach took exception to !
the Judge's questions and was called
down.
Eastman testified to entering the saloon j
and seeing the men playing at a percent- \
.age game of poker. He saw the defend-,
ant take chips from the "pot" on the ;
table and hand them to the manager. He
saw the manager offering cash or checks j
to the players at the table.
He was cross-examined at considerable
length by Ach a* to his knowledge of the
game of poker and a long time was wast- .
ed in asking questions about Eastman's I
: playing poker in Chico twenty-five years
ago. He declared that the checks taken ;
by the defendant from the table repre- I
sented a percentage of the "pot." His ;
definition of the word percentage was a j
â¢ proportion or part of 100.
Jerome H. Tyrrell, a police officer on ,
special duty, was the next witness. He
corroborated Eastman and said he arrest- |
ed the defendant while lie had a check in
his hand which he had taken from the
"pot." It was a percentage game of poker
that was being played.
Tyrrell's cross-examination was going
1 on when court was adjourned. The case
â  will be continued this afternoon.
Large Bids for Realty.
Many moneyed men were . present on
Wednesday at A. M. Speck & Co.'s auc
tion sale, attracted by two leading pieces
on their catalogue. For these the bidding
was active, while the smaller pieces were
comparatively neglected. For the prem
ises on the southeast corner of Fourth
and Mission streets much rivalry .was dis
played. The lot Is 50 by 100 feet, with
frame improvements renting for $434 a
month. There is a mortgage of $35 .000 on
the place. The highest offer made was
$69,600 by Louis Metzger, subject to con
firmation by the owner. A bid of $40.5.0
was made for the premises at 22 and 21
Turk street, on the north side, between
Mason and Taylor. The lot is 34:4% by
137:6, and the building contains two stores
and a lodging-house of twenty-eight
rooms. For the cottage and lot, 34:4% by
48:9 on the west line of Mason street,
34:4% north of Green, $2950 was obtained,
and for a lot, 25 by 120, on the south line
of Haight, 155 west of Broderick, $1600 was
bid. '7 :f'< - 'â

the best-known newspaper artists of the
city. One of the most interesting features
of this department, which is under the
supervision of Mrs. Mills, will â¢be the
Overland Monthly exemplification of the
making of a book. ?;;,v
At the lower end of the long gallery is
located what the committee regards as
the most important of the many attrac
tive exhibits. It consists of a huge pot
ter's wheel, which forms a part of the
Roblin art pottery exhibit of Mrs. Wil
liam Ireland Jr. of this city. A fine dis
play of Stockton art pottery is made In
the exhibit of Nathan, Dohrman & Co.
It would require a page to enumerate
the multitude of unique and artistic pro
ductions which form a part of the exhi
bition. In addition to those already men
tioned there are marvels in the way of
laceâ real old point laceâ made on the spot
after the methods in vogue, among the
famous lacemakers in Europe, a display
of this work from Santa Rosa being
bound to attract special attention; drawn
needlework by. poor Spanish women of
Santa Barbara; scissor etching, wood
etching and carving; modeling in clay;
silk weaving, Indian basket work and
blanket weaving, needle painting, etc.
Specimens of wood and leather etching
by the O'Hara sisters of Livermore ar-e
worthy of special mention, as' is an ex
hibit of .the same kind of work by Mrs.
Hardistv. The' Asylum for the Deaf and
Dumb and Blind at Oakland furnishes one
of the most remarkable exhibits of .what
can be produced by its pupils as a result
of the modern system of manual training.
Creditable exhibitions are also made by
the Lincoln and Lick schools of this city.
The Union Iron Works exhibits a beauti
ful model of the cruiser San Francisco,
and the University of California college
of agriculture Is represented by a fiber
exhibit. The needlework "painting" on
silk by XV. H. McCain is one of the most
beautiful and artistic displays ever shown
in this city. - . â â â â 
When the exhibit was first proposed by
the California Club the Board of Trade
appropriated $250 to help the thing along,
bur as this sum, together with individual
subscriptions, amounted to a total of only
$305. a sum Insufficient to pay the expense
of the exhibit, it has been made necessary
to charsre a nominal admission fee of 25
cents. The gallery will be open every day
for a week, Including Sunday.
IS MENTALLY COMPETENT.
Mary Matilda Derfebach . Bests Her
Brother and Sisters in Court.
Efforts on the part of the sisters and
brother of Mary Matilda Deffebach to de
clare her incompetent and place her prop
erty, which is located in Mill Valley and
is valued at $10,000. in the hands, of
Michael Flood have been without success.
The case closed yesterday before Judge
Coffey and although the court held that in
his opinion Miss Deffebach was not in
competent he suggested that she dis
charge the present trustee. Dr. Twist,
and name another to care for her Inter
ests. Miss Deffebach was given 'until next
Tuesday to name Dr. Twist's successor
and the matter was continued until that
time. "â  â '" 'â¢-â  'â --â  "â â â 
At the opening of the case yesterday af
ternoon Jessie O. Deffebach. a sister Of
the alleged incompetent, took the stand
and endeavored to impress her conviction
on the court that her sister was not men
tally sound. As an example of her sister's
mental condition she said that a short
time ago she went -to her room on Larkin
street at noon and found the alleged
Incompetent in bed. Oysters. crab
shells and food of all kinds were"
scattered over the floor and her
sister's actions were very peculiar.
Another sister testified to matters of
about the same magnitude and then the
accused took the stand. She told her
Story in such a straightforward manner.
and, although admitting that spiritualists
had nearly driven her crazy a short time
ago. strenuously denied that she was not
mentally competent at the present time.
She said that when she saw that spirit
ualism was driving her insane she desert
ed the faith and has .since completely re
covered. :"i "
Her brother and sister were unable to
prove otherwise and judgment was en
tered as stated.

Jerome's Salary Raised.
The salary of Chief Clerk E. B. Jerome,
clerk No. 1, class 6, of the Custom-house.
has been restored to the old figure, $4000
tier annum, taking effect from the date
of the new oath. About two years ago
Jerome's salary was cut from $4000 to $3025,
on the recommendation of Special Agent
Moore to the effect that the salary was
too large for the oiflce.
Mr. Jerome said yesterday that Major
Moore made the recommendation through
spite because Jerome had refused to join
him in a conspiracy to "down" Customs

One-Half the Trees Killed and the Others
Badly Injured.
The New York Commercial says:
"Reports from all peach growing sections
nre more or ess discouraging. Maryland
growers say that while the ere;, la not en
tirely ruined, the destruction has been so
great that the product of the entire State will
hardly supply home demands. Late reports
from "the southern portion are to the effect
that more fruit will be gathered than previous
ly- reported. It ems to be generally con
ceded thai three-fifths of the peach trees ol
Maryland have been destroyed.
"In Missouri i me of the largest growers
have found that every tree was killed. Re
ports from the entire State are not available.
but those that have been received say that
peach trees generally are dead, and all or
chards must be practically replanted.
"Last year Georgia shipped 2000 cars of
peaches This year not a carload will be sent
from the State, and at a late meeting of the
Fruit Growers' Association it was said that
Georgia consumers would have to buy for their
own use this season. The trees are not dead.
but are so injured that none blossomed this

"In some parts of Pennsylvania the crop
will be a total failure. How seriously the trees
have been injured it is Impossible to say, but
only a few have blossomed. Some growers are
inclined to think that the injury is only tem
porary, and that the trees will bear again next
year.
"The Delaware crop will be a failure. Last
years yield was only 1.000,000 baskets, com
pared with previous yields of more than 9,000.
--000. Very ninny of the trees were killed, and
ull were so badly frozen that no blossoms have
appeared.
"Statements from Canadian growers are more
â¢â¢â ments from Canadian growers are more
encouraging. It is said that the Province of
Ontario will send out more peaches than ever
before. The cold of February had less effect
in the far North than in the South. .T. H.
Hale, the prominent peach grower of Connecti
cut, is quoted as saying that "the yield of the
country will be scarcely half an average crop."
and he also says that It will take five years
before orchards can bear as freely as they
have for the past few years.''
PRUNES UNDER FALSE LABELS.
The New York Commercial gives away the
following:

"Hartwig A- Bennett are putting un what
they term a French prune in a new package,
a 40-lb. tin pall, with key for opening. The
fruit is really the best quality of Californiaâ,
but is put up in French style and goes out
under the name of French goods. The trade
expresses approval of the form of package and ]
indications point to an active demand for It."
The same paper says:
"For purely local reasons there is said to
have been a larger demand for prunes in thÂ«
English market than ever before, and prices
have shown some indication of advancing.
Here! I the demand from England has
nearly all gone to France, but French growers
are unable to supply that demand at present,
and there appears to be some additional re
quest for American goods Reports from
France indicate that frost has injured the
blooms now on the trees, and prices on French
goods have advanced sharply within a short
time.
"According to recent advices from England
â¢ According to recent advices from England
the demand for a stewinr fruit appears to be
on the increase, and English handlers are seek
ing the assistance of grocers to make this an
important branch of the fruit trade. Califor
nia rrunes have all the qualities required by
English consumers, and there seems likely to
be a strong and increasing demand from there
this season."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 18.â To-day ended on the
Stock Exchange with bears apparently unop
posed and in complete possession of the mar
ket. They made a fierce attack ln prices along
the whole line in the final hour after evi
dences of realizing at various points in the j
list had become quite possible. The largest
volume of profit-taking sales came up on the
market after quite an extended list of rail- !
road stocks had been taken in hand and pushed j
up to a decidedly higher level. This move
ment In the railroads continued after the lead
ing specialties had begun to go down and
gave a suggestion of a shifting of speculation 'â 
by taking out profit from the specialties and
putting them into railroads. But the railroad i
lift succumbed to the late attack, many stocks
losing between one and two points, and Bur- i
lington dropping 2% below the high point of
the day. Practically all the earlier gains In i
the railroads were wiped out, though small )
net advances remained In a very few case- '
Prices were marked up at the opening to ac
commodate the outside public who were com
ing in to buy after yesterday's notable ad- I
vances. The demand from that source was
soon satisfied and prices yielded and the mar
ket fell Into dullness at the decline. Losses
were sharpest of course In those stocks which
have been rushed up during the last few days
Railroads showed a pretty good resistance and
Manhattan was notably strong, touching 114
Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie i
which had not moved In a long time, became
briskly active, the common stock rising 10%,
and the preferred 7%. As the day progressed
a large demand sprang up for Atchison pre
ferred, the grangers. Union and Northern Pa
cific and other standard railroad stocks. Very
heavy bloeCa of Atchison preferred were taken
on the rise and the price in a number of cases
advanced over a point. Anaconda Mining also '
enjoyed a gain of 3*4 points. It whs under ,
cover of this movement In the railways that
the realizing of profits in the specialties was
In progress. Nearly all the Flower specialties.
Sugar and Tobacco began to sag under the ;
weight or the sales. In the attack which the '
bears were thus encouraged to make on the !
market. Sugar and Metropolitan Street Rail- I
way dropped over 7 points, Brooklyn Transit
4%, and a number of specialties 2 points or '
over. There was a momentary rally, but prices
plunged downward again .and the closing was
very weak and unsettled. Sugar alone rely
ing over a point on the taking of bear pro
fits, but the prices generally ending at the
lowest of the day. There was nothing In the
general news of the day which seemed to
influence the trading, unless It might be a
further hardening ln the rate of exchange
which continues to rise and Is near the gold
Import point, in spite of- the continued ease of
money, and the apparent abundance of funds
both hero and in the interior.
There was no diminution in the heavy de
mand for the new bond Issues of some of the
railroads, notably the Central Pacific reor
ganization Issues. Prices of railroad bonds held
notably firm. Total sales $5,020,000. United
States 8* advanced % in the bid price.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 18.â The Commercial Ad-
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
There was a holiday feeling to-day in the
markets, but they were firm. Americans were
wanted generally and were well above parity,
particularly Pacific issues and St. Paul, but
New York sold all around, chiefly St. Paul,
causing the worst prices at the close. There was
a further relapse in the street, and finally a
Blight rally. Spanish fours were 63% on belated
bear closing and coppers were hard but- under
the best. Tintos were 43%. Anacondas closed
at 12 5-16, but were bought largely in . the
street to 12%. Utahs were 8%, Bostons 29 1-18.
Silver finished flat at 28, America selling free-
ly. The rate was unchanged at 3 per cent.

of values. Fifty-seven cents Is still available

WHEAT AND OTHER GRAINS.
WHEATâ Bullish news hardened the Chicago
market. Reports from there said that the
market was broadening on the worst prospects
ever known. Crop reports are deteriorating
dally. A drought Is reported In Odessa, . and
the Roumanian crop was half lost before the
recent rains came, and the remaining half
looks poorly. Talk of Hessian fly in the West
continues. The situation in the Danube is re-
ported worse.
This market is unchanged on the spot, but
firmer In futures. ".-â¢'.â  . - :^

CONVENTION I S OPENED.
Five Thousand Voicas Burst
Into Song and Start the
Endeavorers' Work.
OAKLAND, May 18.â "Onward, Chris
tlan Soldiers," sung by five thousand
voices, opened the State convention of the
Christian Endeavorers at the Exposition
building to-night. Not since the days of
the great Mills revival many years ago,
for which occasion the building was erect
ed, has there been such grand chorus
singing within It.
As the last words were being sung
"Father" Clark walked on the platform
and was at once greeted with a waving
welcome by thousands of white hand
kerchiefs.
State President Lowell, In viewing the
beautiful exhibition of millinery in the
i audience, reminded the ladles that there
were a few of the other sex present who
would no doubt feel grateful if they would
1 remove their hats and show what their
i hair-dressers had done!
President Lowell ln a few remarks for
, mally opened the convention and invited
Rev. C. R Brown to invoke a blessing
| on the assembly.
Chairman John C. Suhr of the '99 com
| mittee in a speech of greeting said the
: privilege of welcoming the Endeavorers
| from the north, south and east of this
I State was Indeed great. "Ever since Ala-
I meda County was trusted with the care

welcome you all because we have some
thing to be proud of. Everything is
thrown open* to you. In behalf of Ala
meda County I bid you welcome to our
homes, our churches, our hospitality and
our hearts. We hope your stay here will
be a benefit to you as well as to us and
may we all bless in the future the days
of Oakland '93."
The president introduced Mayor Snow
as one of those rare exceptions in muni
cipal government who was determined
that righteousness shall prevail. Mayor
R. XV. Snow said: .-.:;;
"We are never so conscious of munici
pal defections as when we have honored
guests. We may have- a rival In the
southland at present, but we are not a
mean city. Many of those who have been
struggling to find a fortune in the rocks
have all been looking forward to a home
ln Oakland and many of them are now.
among the 70,000 Inhabitants. The Chris
tian Endeavor has passed the stage of.ex
periment. You are anxious to learn how
to perform the maximum of work with
the minimum of expenditure. You are
young and jostle some of us older folks.
The world is more critical to-day in mat
ters of religion than ever before. You
are being measured In- a. rod that is very
carefully marked. You are certain to
have a convention that will bo memorable
in Christian Endeavor annals. You can
not fail to bless us. Your confidence and
your fervid Christian love cannot fail to
inspire us, and when you come again, as
you will, we shall treat you better still,
for we shall have learned of you."
On behalf of the clergy of Oakland Rev.
J. K. McLean, D.D., welcomed the dele
gates. "It is indeed a pleasure," said
It. McLean, "on behalf of fifty or more
ministers of our city to welcome such a
bright-faced throng. We thank you lot
coming and we want you to stay. On
behalf of tin- churches of these ministers
I. give you welcome. I trust that the
company of preachers will feel them
selves upborne by your presence at their
churches next Sunday and indeed many
successive Sundays. Your presence is an
inspiration. The battle here Is heavy
sometimes, as elsewhere, Oakland is not
only a place of privilege, but -a place of
contest. Sometimes it seems almost as
if the forces of evil were in the ascend
ant, *>ut it is our duty and your duty to
see that the right prevails. It 'wan "in
August, 18S2, that six boys and seven girls
gathered together in the First Congrega
tional Church and in reality organized the
first society of Christian Endeavor on the
Pacific Coast. The thirteen grew to
forty-seven in a â  month, and that Is
typical of its growth ever since. This
convention is the result of the seed sown
here just seventeen years ago and I wel
come you to the cradle of Christian En
deavor on the Pacific Coast. : v â -
â  "I. wish to call your attention to tin
task that seems to appeal to us more on
this coast than to any other body of peo
ple. In the land beyond the sunset there
is a great problem facing great 'dif
ficulties. Beyond us there is no more
west; the east begins. You are called
now to high duties, to the most serious
view of that for which we existâ to
be sword-bearers, banner-bearers, cross
bearers, ready to go forth In the name of
Christ to carry to others that blessing
which we ourselves now enjoy. Be true
to the opprtunity and God will giveâ
grace passing your conception."
"Let the Blessed Sun Shine In." spe
cially written for the convention by Pres
ident Lowell, was sung, after which Rev-
F. E. Clark, D.D.. president of the United
Society of Christian Endeavor, returned
the welcome on behalf of the visitors and
delegates.
"I have to speak to you from the words
'thank you,' " said Father Clark, "and It
is an easy task in view of the grand wel
come that has been accorded us. I wish
to speak for a wider "circle than is here.
I have come from many of your fellow
Endeavorers whom you have never seen. .
Many of you -are expected at Detroit in
July, and from no. other State will deb -
gates be more welcome than from Cali
fornia, for every State remembers the
cry, 'California, '97.' I bring you from
Detroit and from St. Paul and from Mani
toba and from Utah greetlngs-and reports
of progress. Nevada also sends greet
ings, and I assured them all that their
messages should be delivered. California
thinks very well of her State, and 1 do
not Heme her. Your Influence should ex
tend north and south, so aa to nelp other
States who are not so favored in the mat
ter of population or of Christian influ
ences. I bring you greetings from Ja
maica, where for two and a half centuries
England has insured prosperity where
formerly Spain could do nothing. . I bring
greetings from Cuba, where under Amer
ican Influence Christian Endeavor work
is thriving and we shall hear great things
from that country In the future. One
year ago I supposed Cuba was the last
place where we would expect to find
Christian Endeavor societies. Not long
ago I was in India, and from there and
from China, Japan and from Europe I
have greetings to all Endeavorers, and
when I visit these places again I shall tell
them of the greetings and welcome from
California."
Rev. Hugh K. Walker of Los Angeles
preached the convention sermon from the
motto of the '99 convention, "Reflecting
Christ." In the course of his remarks
he said: "Christian Endeavorers are not
philosophers or Christian scientists or
theosophlsts or phylactery dealers or

! spook agents. They are broader than all
these, and their mission is greater. Our
religion is no better than that of the first
century, but our Christianity Is better.
' We are more enlightened and more is ex
! pected of us. We must have character as
i well as creed. You cannot divorce faith
I and life, and do not listen to vain babblers
who would persuade you otherwise. You
.of Oakland are fortunate in having a
Christian Mayor. We in Los Angeles have
a good Mayor, but he is not a professing
Christian. The theme for this convention
, is 'Reflecting Christ.' It is a great theme

THE JUDGE WAS GENEROUS.
A Youngl Couple Made Happy by the
Loan of Money to Pay for a
Marriage License.
Judge Mogan enacted the part of the
friend In need yesterday, and by doing so
made two lives happy. Peter F. Gleason.
â  a teamster 19 years of age, living at 251
' Dore street, apneared In court to answer
i a charge of betrayal under promise of
marriage. The complaining witness was
| Amelia Gapejlo, a pretty girl 20 years of
I age. living at 1351 Harrison street.
When the case was called the Judge
; asked Gleason why he did hot marry the
! girl, and he said he would, but ho did
I not have any money to bay for the
! license. The Judge pulled $2 out of his
pocket and handed It to Gleason and
instructed an officer to accompany Glea
son to "Cupid" Danforth's office. There
j the license was procured, Gleason's father
being present, and on their return to
: court Justice of the Peace Groezinger was
'. sent for and after adjourning to Judge
Mogan's chambers the ceremony was
speedily, performed that made the pair
man and wife. Judp_- Mogan promptly
' dismissed the case against Gleason and
â  husband and wife went away together.

"One of those girls is the daughter of a
Methodist minister, and it is a shame that
there should be places in this city where
peoole who would not drink publicly are i
enabled to do it privately." This remark
was made by Councilman* Girard last
night when making a tour of the saloons
and all-night restaurants with License j
Inspector Maloon nnd other members of :
the License Committee.
The object of the tour was to obtain \
information on the subject for the purpose
of framing an intelligent and practical ,
ordinance regulating the liquor traffic, j
The iaw under consideration provides that
there shall be no side entrances, no locks
on doors to private! rooms and also dis- I
criminates against Basements. It is also
probable thai it may provide that no
licenses be issued to corner groceries.
Over a dozen places were visited last ]
night, but In nearly all of them there
were no locks on the doors or the catches
had been broken off. In one place noted
for selling liquor to minors the Council-;
men v. ere about to retire without having
discovered anything objectionable, when
four ho;.-' et me In and at once went up
to the bar as if they were accustomed
to do it. ''Iris place has been under the
ban for some time, and it Is not likely
that its license will be renewed.
In another place in some of the private
rooms young boys and girls of respecta- ;
<â ;,â  parentage were found drinking beer,
and it was in this place that Mr. Girard
made his discovery. Mr. Stetson and Mr.
Cuvellier, who were also of the party, will ;
probably recommend modifications of the
ordinance, as there .are a few places of
respectability upon which It would work ]
a hardship.
A large delegation of protestants from i
East Oakland appeared before the License
Committee In regard to the Union Hotel I
bar. Attorney Garrlty appeared for Mr. j
Morgan, the applicant, and many of the
church people spoke on the other side. The I
committee, after hearing all the testi
mony, decided unanimously to recommend
that the license be rejected.

SOME QUEER METHODS
OF INSURANCE WARS
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, !
908 Broadway, May IS.
A most Interesting development was '
brought out at the trial to-day of Thomas
F. Agnew, charged with embezzlement !
before a Jury in Judge Hall's court. It
was an exposure of the methods employed j
by me insurance companies to reap big I
business during rate cut wars.
Agr.. is specifically charged with hay- 'â 
ing collected $55 from Charles Jurgens on
policy 0710 of the Home Insurance Com- j
pany of New York in July, 1896. The poi
icy was shown at the trial to have been
written in December, 1595, to take effect
in February. 1897. This, moreover, was a!
mercantile risk, and the custom Is not to
date such risks beyond sixty days ahead
and not for over one year at a time. Thus
in the present case the premium was I
paid nearly a year before the risk com
menced, and was to run for three years.
This was done apparently to control
future business, but even then did not
hold good for the insured, though the !
company made no objection to its agent, j
Agnew, at the time.
According to the testimony of the com- I
pany's witnesses, the cancellation of the !
policy was demanded of Agnew In June, j
1896, but th" Oakland agent refused. In i
the following August the company in- !
quired why the policy had not been can
celed; and shortly afterward Agnew was !
dismissed. In December, 1896, a special |
agent, Ron*, from the San Francisco office, j
called on Jurgens and paid him back the
premium In full and took up the policy, j
Agnes took the witness stand in his own '
behalf this afternoon and stated that
communications from the head offlce re- '
garding cancellations were generally held
in the San Francisco offlce and were dis- i
cussed when he visited there frequently.
Moreover, he testified that at the time of
the alleged embezzlement the company
owed him several hundred dollars in com
missions, j
The trial promises to grow in interest i
and will occupy several days. j

CARS DIRECT TO GLEN PARK.
The San Francisco and San Mateo elec
tric car line will, by to-morrow night, |
have the spur line running into Glen
Park complete. This addition will en- 1
able the public when visiting Glen Park
to get into the grounds direct from the i
San Francisco and San Mateo line at any
point east of the park. Heretofore the
cars running on Guerrero street trans
ferred passengers at Thirtieth street to
the Chenery-street line going south. I:-.- .
the completion of the spur line into the !
park the changes will be made at Chen- !
cry and Diamond streets (bridge), instead I
of at Thirtieth.
All cars will run to this poi -it, and those I
intended for the park will continue into I
the park Inclosure by the new line just !
completed.
The work on the double track from
Thirtieth street to Holy Cross has been
delayed In consequence of the non-arrival
of the steel rails from the East. As soon
as these rails reach here the double track
will be pushed to a finish as rapidly as
men and money can be made to put the
road In first-class condition.
It is the intention of the management j
of this road to make it one of the best
in the city. With this object in view the j
directors are contemplating the purchase
of a sufficient number of modern built!
cars for the Increased traffic which has
_f late been bestowed upon the line.
INDORSES THE MINERS.
The Building Trades Council at its
meeting last night declared the firm of
Campbell & Pettis to be unfair because
of its failure to comply with trade rules.
The firm has a contract for Government
work on Goat Island, and by the edict of
the council union men will refuse to ac
cept employment from it.
The council also condemned the action
of the Idaho authorities and General Mer
riam in their attitude toward the union
miners, and it congratulated the miners
for refusing to accede to the mandate of
the authorities. The work of the special
committee appointed to draft a circular
iter to the public in connection with
Wiener's panorama of the battle of Ma
i-.ila, the substance of which is an appeal
to the laboring men of the city to with
held their patronage, was approved and
the committee was Instructed to take
steps to place the circular in the hands
of the citizens of the city and county of
San Francisco. .
The joint committee of the Building
Trades Council and the Labor Council,
which is to make arrangements for a
labor day celebration, will hold a prelimi
nary meeting next week. jMHsar

ANXIOUS TO

CARPENTER
Clerk Kelly's Friends

Seek His Removal.
â * â
j The friends of Thomas Kelly, clerk of !
[ Judge Graham's court, are after the j
| scalp of Prosecuting Attorney L. G. Car- j
i penter, evidently convinced that he is re
j sponsible for the recent expose of Kelly's
j methods in â¢ releasing criminals. His
j friends have rallied to his support, and
| declare in unmeasured terms' that they
' will get even with him. even at the sacri
| fice of Carpenter's official position.
Kelly was appointed a clerk of Police
j Court 4 through the political influence of
''Spike" Flynn and "Billy" Gallagher,
who conduct a saloon in the tenderloin
! district. Flynn some time ago was
j charged with the killing of his partner's
brother,' but was discharged after a pre
: liminary examination in the Police Court.
Carpenter prior to his appointment as
! Prosecuting Attorney served as a reporter
,on an evening paper. Recently the paper
I on which he was employed published a
i scathing â¢ article, accusing Kelly of ac
j cepting straw bonds and directly charg-
I ing him With having lent his assistance
in securing the release of Harry Wilson,
the negro, who was arrested on suspicion
of being the st rangier of May McDermott
! and Bertha Paradis. Wilson was given
his freedom on worthless bonds, and at
once left the city. He was traced to
Santa Ortiz, where he was recognized and
arrested.
After satisfying themselves that Prose
. cuting Attorney Carpenter had inspired
: the article which reflected so seriously
on Kelly's character, Gallagher and
, Flynn, his bosom * friends, started out
j with the avowed determination of getting
i "even" with him. Accompanied by sev
! eral other men with acknowledged alle
giance to Kelly, they hunted up Phil
Crimmins and demanded that he use his
I influence to have the Board of Supervis
j ors revoke the appointment of Carpen
ter. Crimmins, it is claimed, promised
them that he would exert his "pull" to
j have Carpenter removed from office.
Both Flynn and Gallagher confidently
i expect that Carpenter's head will shortly
| fall in the basket. They openly declare
I that they are against him and hope to
get even with him for what they term
! his peculiar position in regard to Kelly,
! whose duties as a Police Court clerk are
j confined to another court. Carpenter
| laughs at the efforts of Flynn and Galla
j gher to get his scalp, so to speak. He
| is satisfied that the Supervisors will not
; remove him. even if Crimmins is a party
I to the scheme.

DROWNED WHILE WASHING
RADISHES AT A FAUCET
OAKLAND. May IS.â Coroner Mehrmann was advised this evening of one
of the most peculiar cases of drowning on recordâ quite distancing
the case at San Leandro of a month or more ago, when a child met
death ln a barrel half-buried in the ground and containing not quite a
foot of water. __-'Ââ Â«''!'
Late this afternoon Harry Annant, aged 4 years, while playfully washing
some radishes beneath a faucet on' his father's ranch at Sufiol fell Into a
tub, kept under the faucet to catch the dripping, and was drowned before
his parents or the ranch hands near by noticed the child's perilous position.
The tub was barely half full, containing but a few inches of water, while
the faucet was slightly open. When the little one fell in he made no outcry.
Half an hour later one of the ranch hands' attention was arrested by. the
little sun-burned legs dangling lifelessly over the top of the tub, and when he
extricated the child, therefrom he 'was horrified to find that life was extinct.
Coroner Mehrmann has ordered an inquest to be hajd.

FOOT BINDING
CRUSADE TO BE
INAUGURATED
Clergy Will Preach
and Practice.
This week will see the Inception of anew
crusade against foot binding in China
town. It is claimed that the custom is on
the increase and several clergymen have
taken up the cause of the little heathen
and will not only inveigh . against the
wholesale manufacture of cripples but
will invoke the law to put a stop to the
practice.
Rev. Dr. .Wilson of the Howard-street
Methodist Church began the crusade and
j has found an able second In Rev. Dr.
â¢ Locke, who was In Chinatown last night
getting data for a sermon which he will
preach on the subject next Sunday night.
A careful list of all the little-foot women
and children has been made with the
j names and addresses of their parents. It
has taken weeks of patient investigation
j to get these names, for the parents, as
; soon as they found, that inquiries were
being made, spirited away the children
and denied that any such custom existed.
The investigation was fully made, how
ever, and now every child" which has its
feet bound is known and its parents will
; have to answer for It. Test cases will
j be made and the work will be followed
up until the crippling Industry Is broken
up. No less than twenty little-footed
girls were counted yesterday on the
streets of Chinatown. One little tot of
about 5 years was seen making her first
I attempt at walking after the binding pro-
cess and the- painful efforts she. made
| â were enough to convince any one that the
custom Is a vicious one.
It is the intention of those who have
inaugurated the crusade to carry the mat
ter to the courts and continue doing so
until the custom is completely eradicated.

SOUTHWELL'S WARBLERS PLAY
SEESAW WITH CUPID. \
â¦
A Marriage That Was First Solemn-
A Marriage That Was First Solemn-
ized by a Catholic Priest and .
Then by an Episcopal
Minister.
Two fond hearts were made one for the
second time yesterday at the Grace Epis
copal Church by the Rev. R. C. Foute.
J. A. Braidwood and Catherine Hahn, two
members of the Southwell Opera Com
pany now playing at the Grand Opera
house, are the leading characters In
what may be termed a most peculiar mat
rimonial difficulty.
Braidwood and his bride, â  Catherine
Hahn, have been joined in wedlock at
both ends of this broad continent and in
two faiths at that.
Miss Hahn, or, rather, Mrs. Braidwood,
is a strict Roman. Catholic and the hus
band is an exacting Episcopalian, and the
difference in their religions has made a
double marriage necessary.
Braldwood married Miss Hahn, whose
stage name is Caldwell, in New York, and
the fnarriage was solemnized in the Ro
man Catholic churcn. The husband has
since been imploring his young and pretty
wife to have their marriage solemnized
over again by an Episcopal minister. On
the long trip across the continent to this
city the loving couple were constantly
billing and cooing and whispering, much
to the amusement of the rest of the com
pany, who little knew the tender subject
of their conversation. By the time the
company arrived here the persuasive
warbler had half succeeded in getting his
wife to consent to have their marriage
solemnized over again in his own faith.
Pearly this week he finished his labor of
love and religion and Mrs. Braidwood
agreed to become Mrs. Braidwood again
just to satisfy her husband.
The couple attempted to guard their se
cret from the prying ears of the rest of
the company, but in some way or another
Charlie Jones, the genial stage manager
of the company, found it out, and of
course Charlie had to tell it to Mr. Persse,
who sings so sweetly the role of Turridu
in "Cavalleria RuÃticana," and then the
story was fed the ear . of , every mem
ber of the company from the chorus girl
to young Mr. Southwell. -
Braldwood and his wife are both ex
tremely popular, and last night congratu
lations were showered upon them. It was
not until Charlie Jones good naturedly
wormed an admission out of Braldwood
that it became known that the. young
couple had even been married .In New
York.
"Yes, I was married to-day at Grace
Church," admitted Mr. Braid-wood when
seen last night by a Call reporter. "You
se,e, I first married my wife in the Catho
lic church. 1 have been raised a strict
Episcopalian, and while I Harbor a pro
found respect for her religion I did not
feel satisfied. When we arrived here_sve
decided to have our marriage solemnized
again by an Episcopal minister. Accord
ingly I procured a license and to-day we
were married by the Rev. Mr. Foute."
SOUGHT HIS KITTENS
BUT FOUND FLAMES
PECULIAR ACCIDENT TO A CAT
FANCIER.
A leaking gas meter was the cause of
a serious accident to Rlcardo Brunaccl
at 1026 Darkin street last evening, and
: might have resulted in a large conflagra
j tion had. it not been for a prompt
I response from the Fire Department.
For a number of years Bru'nacci kept a
j saloon at the above address, and when he
failed was without home or funds. The
: landlord, Julius Abrams, permitted him
'to retain the quarters, and he occupied a
room in the rear as living quarters. His
; particular hobby was kittens, and he
; housed a number of them in a small
j closet inclosing the gas meter, which was
never used. -V- -â¢â .-â 
Last evening about 8 o'clock he went to
look for the cats that he might feed them,
and failing to locate them struck a
match. Instantly there was an explosion
and a sheet of flame enveloped Brunaccl.
Seeing that a conflagration was Imminent
he took off Ms coat and attempted to ex
tinguish the fire. In this he was unsuc
cessful and only increased . his injuries.
He repaired to a drug store and from
there to the Receiving Hospital, where
several severe burns on the hands, neck
and. head were dressed. , '-" â  'â Â;> r-;
An alarm was turned in from box 137
--and the Fire Department succeeded in
getting the flames under control after the
building, which was a three-story frame.
had been damaged to the extent of about
$300.

FRUIT GROWERS
ASK QUESTIONS
OF HUNTINGTON
He Must Declare His Relations
With the Armour-Porter-
Earl Combine.
Convention Will Open Tuesday in Sacra-
mento and Will Be the Biggest Con-
clave of Orchardists Ever Held
in California.
RT'SS D. STEPHENS, leader of those
who have taken up the fight for
the fruit growers against the Ar
mour-Earl-Porter refrigerator ear
combine, came down from Sacra-
mento yesterday and submitted to
Mr. Bproule, traffic manager of the South
ern Pacific, a typewritten list of questions
to be answered by him or his superiors.
They will give rise to a deal of conference
and a lot of hard figuring in the yellow
building before the grow convention
begins on Tuesday next.
The questions submitted by Mr.
Stephens yesterday are those framed by
the committee of fruit growers which met
in Sacramento last Tuesday: They are
pertinent inquiries as to the position the
Southern Pacific has decided to take be
tween the big fruit trust that has been
set up and the growers. Whether they he
answered or whether not the result will
be the same. Mr. Huntington will be com
pelled to show his hand, and once it is
shown the associated orchardists will
know how to best play their cards.
Precisely what the questions are Mr.
Stephens, as a matter of policy, declines
to say. "Just what the questions are I
must decline to make public." said he.
"I can say, however, thai generally they
are as to what refrigerator car service
the Southern Pacific could furnish the
fruit growers should they decide to ask
for it: how the company is fixed on cars
suitable to the business; whether or not
it would carry over its lines the cars of
some ono or other of the Eastern fruit
transportation companies, and other ques
tions of a similar nature.
"In fact." continued he, "we have asked
every question that could arise should we
decide to organize an independent trans
portation company of our own or con
summate a deal with some Eastern asso
ciation not now doing business in the
State nor tied up to the Earl and Porter
gang. '
Mr. Stephens spent the better part of
two ours in discussing his list with Mr
Sproule and Mr. Shepherd, the assistant
traffic manager, and both officials prom
ised him he should have an answer to
each of his inquiries in time to submit
them to the convention on Tuesday. Upon
the position in the matter taken or to be

If the Southern Pacific can and will
accept fruit at the old refrigerating rate
or will permit the travel of Eastern com
panies over its system then the matter
is practically settled and the growers will
have no fight on their hands. If the
Southern Pacific will not do these things.
if present indications develop into fact
and the company stands with the Ar

then the growers have a fight on their

Tuesday will settle finally for peace or
war. and judging from the great jangling
of fighting harness and the war songs
going up from the country press of the
State the growers have little expectation
that It will be anything else man fight.
And by the word of Etuss Stephens mm
self they are prepared to tight. "This
convention will be the. biggest and most
unanimous demonstration the growers of
this State have ever made," said he last
night. "We are getting word that Its
owner is going to be on hand from about

THE PULLMAN CAR EXCURSION
TO MT. SHASTA AND VICINITY.
Large Demand for Reservations.
As was expected the simple an-
nouncement that the Southern Pacific
Company would run a Pullman car ex-
cursion to the famous Shasta region
on June 3 has brought forth a large
inquiry and the request for reserva
tions at this early date has assumed
such proportions -that it will be neces-
I sary to positively limit the number of
passengers that can be accommodated
on this train, consequently those who
intend taking this delightful trip and
have not made their reservations had
better do so, as it is quite likely the
sale of tickets will have to be stopped
several days prior to the departure of
the train.
It is unnecessary to add to what has
already been said in regard to the sub
lime scenery and other attractions of
the Shasta route. To those who have
never visited that region a rare treat
is now presented.
ASK FOR MORE PAY.
The commissioners who were recently
appointed to appraise the property in the
district proposed to be covered by the ex
tension to the panhandle appeared before
the Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors yesterday and asked that the

creased from $500 to $2000.

PACIFIC MAIL
PLOT EXPOSED
AT the "Washington end of the hatchet-
men's line it Is reported that C. P.
Huntington and his associates in the
business of landing coolie labor into
the United States are trying to undermine
Chinese Inspector Gardiner of this city.
A reliable authority from Washington
states that the charge has been made that
Dr. Gardiner willfully misinterprets Chi
nese letters Introduced in evidence, and
solely for the purpose of preventing the
landing of applicants and of besmirching
the reputations of Meredith, Huntington
and their official and other backers. The
plot leaked out in time, however, for the
friends of the doctor and for the mission
ary societies to -take the necessary steps
to counteract this stab in the dark, and
they will endeavor to secure the publica
tion of the translations of certain letters
found on the person of a Chinese mer
chant returning from the Orient on the
steamer China several months ago. These
letters were from a Chinese broker to
another person, and spoke of the manner
in -which the ring had succeeded, through
the Influence of the Pacific Mail, In land
ing a large number of Chinese persons
who were not entitled to admission into
this country. Names of the persons land
ed were given and the means by which
they had been landed were set forth fully.
The letters told of bribery having been
resorted to successfully and the price of
landing a Chinese person was stated to
bo from $40 to $50, the money being paid
'TWAS A SMALL
BULLET, BUT IT
DID THE WORK
Sudden Suicide of an
Unknown Man.
With a small caliber target pistol an
| unknown man succeeded In killing him-
I self yesterday about noon. He had en-
tered a small shooting-gallery on Dupont
street, and under the pretext of taking
! some shots at the target there he asked
| and was given a 22-callber pistol and four
; cartridges. He raised the pistol for his
first shot, and after two or three attempts
to aim he turned it quickly toward him
-1 self and fired. The bullet entered his
head through the right temple. He fell
unconscious to the lloor and four hours
later he died at the Receiving Hospital.
There was nothing on the person or in
; the pockets of the suicide which would
give the slightest Idea of his Identity. He
was a man of medium height, sandy
hair and a small sandy mustache,
sunburned, rough. calloused hands.
He was a workingman, from his clothes
and hands, and those who saw him just
before he killed himself say he spoke like
i a Swede. There was no money in his
pockets, nor papers nor cards of any
i kind. He was not known in the vicinity
of the place where he shot himself, and
the last hour of his life he spent In drink-
ing in the Dupont-street saloons and In
patronizing the two shooting galleries on
Dupont street, between Bush and Pine.
His first known appearance on the
street was made from Al White's saloon,
which he had entered a few minutes be-
fore in search of a drink. He was cvi-
dently intoxicated.. Leaving White's he
went across to Wolf's shooting gallery,
then in charge of a plucky young woman
named Agnes _acAlee. He asked for a
: pistol with which to do some shooting,
and as she saw he was drunk she refused
to let him have one. "We never let a
man handle a pistol when he has been
drinking," she afterward explained. lie
took a small rifle instead and made three
poor attempts at the target. He was quite
nervous. -. * ,
After that the man went up the street
two doors and Into a Swiss saloon, where
he said he had come for a match. He was
singing a maudlin song, which the people
in the place took to he Swedish. Accept-
ing an invitation to drink he finished a
glass of beer and then went down the
street to H. C. Josselyn's shooting gal-
lery, where he took three Indifferent
shots with a pistol. Then he went up to
Wolfe's place again and once more asked
for a pistol. The girl in charge refused
to give him one. He was told to shoot
with a riile or not at all. He accepted the
; rifle, and tried to turn it as if he wished
i to look down the barrel. The girl grasped
'it and pointed the weapon toward the
; targets, with a word of warning, and
after three shots he left. He was cvi-
dently drunk, and she thought nothing
'of his queer actions.
His next appearance- was at Josselyn s.
He came in again and called for a pistol.
He was given one and it was loaded for
him. As Josselyn watched him he point-
ed the weapon toward the targets, drew
I It back again and then again pointed it,
and then, before Josselyn could stop him,
â  I he turned the muzzle and shot himself.
In falling he dropped the pistol on the
I counter.

Identification. ' -
PRINTER DYER MISSING,
AND MAY BE DROWNED
INQUIRIES MADE BY ANXIOUS
RELATIVES.
His Description Fits That of the Man
Found Drowned in the Bay Last
Saturday Morning.
-.-â  .:-â .â -â .'-.'
A letter from Cliff B. Rushmer of An
â  gels Camp, Calaveras County, received by
Coroner Hill yesterday tends to cast light
j upon the Identity of a man found drowned
lin the bay last Saturday morning. The
body had been in the water for two or
three weeks and was very much decom-
posed, the features being unrecognizable.
The remains were kept the usual three
days for Identification and then taken by
the city undertaker for interment.
Mr. Ftushmer believes that the deceased
was Clarence Edmund Dyer, a relative, a
member of the San Francisco branch of
the Typographical Union and formerly of
the Call "chapel." His description of Mr.
Dyer and the clothing he wore tallies al
most to a dot with the body found In the
bay. When Dyer left Angels Camp on
April 8 he wore canton flannel underwear
and three undershirts. He had with him
also a silver-plated spoon with the plating
worn off the bottom of the bowl and a
two-bladed penknife with bone handle, a
piece having been chipped off the handle.
The man found drowned had on three
undershirts and two pairs of canton fian
nej drawers, a spoon of the same de.
scription given above and a two-bladed
penknife, but the handle was not chipped.
Dyer was about 5 feet 9 Inches tall, and
the Morgue officials guessed his height
at about 6 feet. It is not customary to
measure corpses,* and the guess may not
have been correct. Dyer was seen in
Golden Gate Park about' three or four
weeks ago by a brother printer, whom he
informed that he intended to leave this
city the next day. The missing man had
been rather "queer' in his actions for
about a year, and it was believed among
his associates that he was losing his rea
son. '":â ', , >, â . .
Nothing has been heard of Dyer since
he was seen in the park. He is unmarried
and has a married sister . residing at

- letters were placed in the hands of
Dr. Gardiner for translation, and when
the result became known "to the persons
entitled to know it there was much per
turbation of soul among certain officials.
The papers were examined by Special
Agents Smith and Llnck and the originals
and the translations were sent to Wash
ington, and are now in possession of the
Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary
was asked by a Call correspondent a day
or two ago whether such letters making
the reflections on the Pacific Mail Com
pany and others were in his possession,
and he replied that they were but that
their contents could not be made public
at the present time.
The Plot against Dr. Gardiner is of
about the caliber of a primary ward meet
ing. He is accused of being incompetent
as an interpreter and translator of Chi
nese, and of misinterpreting letters and
other documents while actuated by re
ligious bigotry against that people. Dr.
Gardiner's reputation as a Chinese
scholar is national,- his knowledge of the
vernacular extending to all the dialects
represented by the Chinese in Amc_ica.
It was supposed that the charge of in
competency or malice was to be backed
up by substituting for original Chinese
documents falsified copies, containing
matter which would prove their charge
against the doctor. But this scheme was
thwarted by the fact that Dr. Gardiner
had enlarged photographic copies of the
letters made for his protection, and upon
his statement to the Secretary of the
Treasury of his reason for so doing the
Secretary ordered the bill paid out of the
Government funds.
The letters show conclusively that the
BOLD CROOKS
LOCKED UP IN
THE TANKS
Accused of Stealing
Valuable Booty.
Through the efforts of Detectives Ryan
and O'Dea. of the Southern station, three
ex-convicts are iocked up in the "tanks,"
accused of stealing $1500 worth of goods
which had been placed in charge of the
Southern Pacific Company. Early Sun
day evening several boxes of silks and
other dress material were turned over to
the railroad company to be shipped to the
Interior. The boxes were duly receipt, d
for and placed on the wharf at the foot
of Market street. A short time afterward
one of the clerks In the employ of the i
railroad company went to get the boxes
and was surprised to find them gone. He
made an investigation, with the result
that he learned that live men were seen
climbing over the wharf from a rowhoa:
and taking possession of the good*l. They
then lowered the boxes into their boat
and quickly rowed away from the scene.
The robbery was at once reported to the
police, and Detectives Ryan and ODea
were detailed to arrest the thieves. By
dint of inquiry the detectives ascertained
that the boat which the men used In get
ting away with the boxes was stolen from
a boatman near the sugar refinery.
Last night Ryan and ODea arrested
three ex-convicts who they say were im
plicated in the robbery. Their names are
Jean Grossette, Harry Williams and John
Ryan. They are opium fiends, and are
known as desperate men. To-day the de
tectives expect to capture the other men
who were implicated in the crime. In
('rosette's room, on Mission street, a por
tion of the stolen property was found.
After being locked up ("rosette made a
confession in which he declared that Wil
liams had planned the robbery and
threatened to kill his accomplices if they
revealed his name to the police.
Williams. was released from Folsom
about three months ago. where he had
served a four year term tor robbery.
POOR WIDOW
COMPELLED TO
SUE CORRIGAN
Paltry Sum Involved
in the Suit.
Kd Corrigan, the discredited racetrack
gambler and turf Jonah, is to be haled
into the Justice Court, where he will be
made, much against his will, the central
figure in a suit wherein he figures __ a
man who seeks to defraud a poor widow
of her small earnings. While the amount
of money involved is not large, it means
much to the woman who is the plaintiff in
the action, and at the same time it serves
to expose for the benefit of the public
the true character of the late director
general of the Ingleslde gambling resort.
The action in question is a suit in at
tachment filed yesterday in the Justice
Court against < !orriga_ by Mrs. Gertrude
Ray held, proprietress of the Oceanslde
House, near the ingleslde track. The
amount of money sought to be recovered
is $S9 83. --J w_ " YY.-.V-
I. ess than a year ago, as alleged in the
complaint, Corrigan went to Mrs. Ray
field and contacted with her for the use
of seven stalls in a barn connected with
the Oceanside House. He wanted them,
lie said, for the accommodation of sev
eral horses which he did not wish to
stable at the racetrack. For the use of
the stalls he agreed to pay a monthly
rental of $5. He was given possession and
used the stalls for the purpose stated for
a period of seven weeks, incurring an In
debtedness of $40 83.' At. the same time he
rented from Mrs. Rayfield a kitchen con
nected with the hostelry for the use of
his help. For the rent of this kitchen he
agreed to pay $1 per day. He had posses
sion of the kitchen for forty-nine days,
thus incurring an indebtedness of $49.
When Mrs. Ray field sought to collect
what was due her from -Corrigan he put
her off first with one excuse and then
with another, though it was represented
to him that his refusal to pay seriously
embarrassed the landlady. After spend
ing weary days and months in an endeavor
to collect what was due her Mrs. Rayfield
was finally forced to . accept the conclu
sion. that the master of Hawthorne In
tended to defraud . her. , In- her distress
she applied to Attorneys William B.
Crocker. and Eugene D. Sullivan and they
undertook to force. payment by means of
suit and attachment. The suit was filed
yesterday, and Corrigan will he required
to tell under oath why he seeks to. avoid

Pacific Mall was influencing the work of
the Chinese Bureau, and that if Gardiner
and Lynch were not in the bureau the
corporation and the slave dealers would
have had everything their #own way.
The Chinese brokers and slave dealers,
discomfited by the breaking up of the
Pacific Mail Bureau for the arlmlssion of
Chinese passengers by Mr. Huntington's
line of steamers, have resorted to a new
dodge to thwart the efforts of the United
States authorities to keen their chattels
from landing. In order to avoid the fatal
contradiction between the statements of
the immigrants on board the steamers to
the Chinese Bureau officials and the testi
mony of the brokers' hatchet men be
fore the bureau, thel' now procure writs
of habeas corpus for passengers before
the bureau has had an opportunity of ex
amining the. applicants. The Immigrant
is then taken before United States Com
missioner Heacock and tells his story. As
it is his first story there will be nothing
In the way of any previous statement by
which he and his witnesses may be con
tradicted, and the Commissioner Is often
obliged to recommend the court "to allow
the applicant to land. '-â â â -â 
Commissioner Heacoek spoke his mind
freely in court yesterday upon this mat
ter. His desire was to call the attention
of the courts to the new phase of the
Chinese Iniquity. He hoped that some
means might be found whereby a stop
might be put to the practice which had
for its object only the nullification of the
purpose for which the exclusion act was
made a law. It is rather a delicate mat
ter, as every person claiming to be a na
tive of the United States has a right to
immediate relief by habeas corpus, and
drastic measures will no doubt be neces
sary to checkmate the schemers.
HUNTINGTON
STILL LOVES
KRUTTSCHNITT
| Story of Animosity a
Romance.
â â¦ â
The story published a few days ago to
the effect that C. P. Huntington's admira
! tion for General Manager Kruttschnltt
was on the wane emanated from a coterie
| In the yellow building and was not based
! on a knowledge of inside facts.
The yellow building is the abode of
many cliques. While all recognize alle
giance to the president of the Southern
Pacific some Intrigue to establish them
selves in his favor by the crude plan of
"knocking" others.
The tale regarding Mr. Huntington's
loss of faith In Mr. Kruttschnltt was told
to stir up a little animosity between the
president of the company- and the general
manager of the operating system. No
doubt Mr. Huntington is not quite satis
fied with the. maim in which the op
erating department of his company Is
managed. He would be a queer sort of
railroad man if he fancied that the man
agement could not be improved. Surely It
has come to his knowledge that the trains
bound for San Francisco are so frequent
ly behind time that an arrival of a train
at the mole on time Is an event rather
than an Incident.
In a general way he may hold Mr.
Kruttscbnltt responsible for these de
linquencies, but perhaps he reflet is that
on the Atlantic system, which is also un
der the supervision of the general man
ager, the operating _ervlce is commend
able.
The Southern Pacific is divided into ]
i three systems. The manager of the At- j
lantic system is XV. Q. Van Vleck, the :
' Oregon system is managed by R. Koelher
and our own cherished Pacific system is
, controlled by that rare antique, J. A. Fill
> more. All three are controlled by Gen
eral Manager Kruttschnitt.
Tourists coming to California do not
i begrudge the time passed on the rail, as
I the slow traveling affords opportunity for
j contemplating the delightful scenery of
mountain and valley, but business men ;
with important engagements to meet kick
against the time lost.
The management of the company is ;
talking seriously of introducing modern
railroad methods on the Pacific system. ;
Very few changes have been made, since j
the last spike was driven at Promontory.
The line has been shortened between San <
Francisco and Sacramento, but the in
crease of speed has been very slight. I
Things are going along in the same de-
lightful old fashion that characterized the
management of the road when Stanford
held court at Fourth and Townsend
streets and everybody closed shop to go .
to the railroad picnic.
Perhaps Mr. Kruttschnitt is not so ac
tive in pensioning the representatives of
the old regime as the president of the
company would wish. He may be re
strained by a clever and tender sense of
local propriety from smashing our Cali
fornia idols with one grand smash for the
sake of precision In the movement of
trains, but whatever the restraining In-
fluence may be he will be expected hence
forth to suppress sentiments of veneration
for old time methods and managers aim
bring the trains in according to the sched
ule. Some changes will be required to
effect this purpose and public announce
â  ment of the changes may not be long de-
layed. â './'., .-, ;.
When Mr. Huntington was casting about
for a general manager with the railroad
ability to fill the place rendered vacant
by the death of A. N. Towne he studied
j the situation carefully and deliberately.
The selection of Mr. Kruttschnltt was the
result of deliberate judgment. The story
of a failure on the general manager's
part to meet the expectations of the pres
ident is a romance of the yellow building.

"TOMMY" KELLY STAYS
AWAY FROM COURT
The Police Clerk, Scenting
Trouble, Goes Into Hiding.
Grand Jury Finds That the Bonds of Ex-
Officer Blackman Were Written and
Signed by the Same Person.
THE police believe that '"Tommy"
Kelly, clerk of Judge Graham's
court, fearing unfavorable action
by the Grand Jury, has packed his
grip and left the city. For several
days he has absented himself from his
desk in Judge Graham's court, his duties
being fulfilled by Assistant Clerk Stout.
Last night he could not be found in his
accustomed haunts, although his friends
vigorously denied the report that he had
left the city.
It is 'known that the Police Court clerk
fears that the Grand Jury will Indict him
for malfeasance in office. His action In
the case of- "Strangler" Wilson, who was,
released on straw bonds accepted by him.
has proved a prolific subject of investiga
tion by the Grand Jury, and it was au
thoritatively said that an indictment
would be found against him. The police
believe that Kelly, scenting trouble, has
either gone into hiding or decamped for
parts unknown. v';'
Yesterday the Grand Jury continued Its
investigations into the methods of Kelly.
Assisted by Captain Seymour, who has
charge of the City Prison, the members
of that body took up the case of ex-Police
Officer Cassius Blackman, who was re
leased on straw bonds, and who lost no
time in placing himself beyond the reach
of the courts of this city. In December,
189S, Blackman, who was then a member
of the regular police "force, and a saloon
keeper named Frank Rood, were arrested

CHINESE SLAVE
DEALERS FEAR
THE VIGILANTS
Their Vile Business
Menaced.
The Vigilant Society, orp-anized little
more than a week ago with the object,
anions other things, of clearing out the
slave pens of Chinatown, has not slum
bered on Its purpose. From the moment
that Its secretary, -I. __. Foote. received
a letter from Mayor Phelan. advising him
that a move would be made against the
houses of 111 fame in the .uongolian quar
ter as soon as information was furnished
concerning their location and ownership,
agents of the society, white and Chinese,
have been busily engaged in securing the
data requested..
Their task has not been an easy one.
The Chinese agents of the organization,
who are also members of the Chinese
Educational Society, have been especially
hampered in their task. More than that,
they have been threatened With death. A
price has been put on the heads of three
of them by the Bow Wah tong. an asso
ciation of keepers of houses of ill fame,
and the highbinders, whose existence de
pends on the profits from the slave pens,
are eager to earn the blood money. The
white special officers, employed in many
instances by the slave dealers, have also
done all they could within the last three
or four days to harass the emissaries of
the Vigilants. That they have not suc
ceeded is not their fault, but it is appar
ent from the report submitted yesterday
by the agents of the reform society,
which information has been forwarded in
a letter to Mayor Phelan. He should re
ceive it this morning and will probably
take the necessary action under the
statute to close the places pointed out.
Of the one hundred and fifty, odd houses
of ill-fame that honeycomb Chinatown a
list of at least seventy-five was submit
ted at yesterday's meeting of the *\ fgi
lants in the Sherman building. Clay and
Montgomery streets. Information con
cerning the other seventy-live had not
been verified and was withheld pending
further investigation. It was decided,
however, that the fight against yellow
vice should not be postponed, and the sec
retary was Instructed to forward at once
to Mayor Phelan the verified information
in the society's possession, so that some
progress might be made to ultimate puri
fication. * ~ -:

In transmitting the information to the
Mayor, Secretary Foote accompanies it
with remarks suggested by the investi
gations of the agents of the society. He
calls attention to the fact that in a num
ber of the houses located on corners of
main streets it is the custom to entertain
young white hoys, and always, even In
the face of the police, to parade the vice
of the entire quarter to the tourist who
goes abroad to tell of the wickedness of
of San Francisco's Chinatown. The sug
gestion is made that *he Mayor persuade
the members of the Board of Supervisors

During the Investigation yesterday the
grand jurors examined the worthless bond
and Were startled by the similarity be

document and the signatures of Rood and

the bond and signatures of -the. worthless
sureties were written by the same per

claimed that the bond passed through

Police Court Clerk. Judge Barry, who
accepted It. says that he was influenced

Rood is also among the missing. The
Grand Jury is anxious to interview him
