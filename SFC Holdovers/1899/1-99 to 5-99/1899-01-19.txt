CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- 1
MENTO, Jan. IS.â There are two po
litical corpses in Sacramento to-night.
One is Speaker of the Assembly How
ard E. Wright and the other is U. S.
Jr., candidate for United States
Senator.
ird K. Wright is not only politi
cally dead, but he is disgraced and dis
credited, reviled by those who have
â J in him and execrated by those
whom he betrayed. That he is still
Speaker of the Assembly is due only to |
the fact that the committee having- in
investigation of the charges
t him has not yet had time to
its report to the Assembly.
Mr. Grant, there is not one
n who followed the testimony I
at the investigation yesterday ;
and to-day but is ready to declare that i
not only has the owr.t-r of the honored I
of Grant allowed that name to be
dragged in the mire of corruption, but
he furnished the money with which his
have sought to corrupt ,
. . legislators. Enough
to establish the con- \
a that Mr. Grant's candidacy is
shade better than that of D. M.
servant of the Southern Pa
any and the father protector
Â©f nine-tenths of the shady politicians !
sional grafters in the State ;
:.ia.
Ai! hings have been assert- j
the columns of The Call during
â¢ . v. eeks. They have been .
n here by sworn testimony with- '
â  days. And the end is
The fall of Speaker Wright
but a prelude to other j
et to come and there is no
ramento to-night who is will-
Ing to predict where the end w^ll be.
Money by checks, money in coin and
was handed out by
luring the four or five
months prior to the day of election, all ;
ior ti e of securing the election j
of legislators who could be induced to |
promise to vote for Grant in case of
tkction. From one end of the
to the other these agents went
the money of their employer and
ail who would accept small sums in ex
change for their honor were purchased
like sheep and put in bonds until the
day when they should be called on to
â¢buy their freedom by assisting in the
>n of Grant as United States Sen
ator.
It was Milton J. Green, Grant's po
litical manager, who confessed to many
ot the details of this infamous traffic.
What he told he told unwillingly, under j
the flre of a grilling cross-questioning
by the members of the committee. Had
t refu dto answer questions of
pertinent to the inquiry the
infamous tale would have been
this refusal, unless he thinks
better </l it, he will probably be com
mitted to jail, there to ponder over the
evil fortune that has befallen him just
at th his campaign of crimi
nality. It is evident that the commit
tee means to get at all of the facts, at
Feast in the direction of the conduct of
Grant's campaign, and its members are
.determined to make Mr. Green the in
strument of their enlightenment or
force him to suffer the consequences. So
it is that to-night Green sees the jail
doors gaping wide for him and with
.no better prospect of escape than that
of a burglar who, dodging the en
circling arms of one policeman, falls
into the clutches of another.
Wright was a witness before the
committee to-night. He succeeded in
demonstrating two things to the satis
faction of all who heard what he had
to say for himself. One is that he is
â guilty of all and more than has been
'charged against Wm, the other that
The San Francisco Call.
I he will not hesitate to tell a deliberate
i falsehood under oath. Perhaps still
1 another thing was demonstrated. It is
that the committee does not propose
to allow Wright to debase himself any
further than such debasement will dis
i credit the Senatorial candidacy of U.
j S. Grant.
However this may be, the fact re
mains that the questioners sought to
put answers in Wright's mouth and re
fused to ask him such questions as had
.been asked of other witnesses. But in
spite of the aid and comfort given him
by his seeming protectors, Wright
could not conceal his abasement. He
confessed to the receipt of $1650 from
Grant through Milton Green. He went
further and confessed to having made a
pledge to support Grant for Senator.
Having made confession, Wright
sought to divert attention from his own
infamy by a tirade of personal abuse
aganist one of the persons who are his
accusers. Needless to say, that abuse,
coming from the lips of such a man
and under such circumstances, is a
certificate of honesty for the person
against whom the abuse is directed.
No one forgets that the strongest evi
dence against this statesman, who
holds honor so lightly that he is will
ing and anxious to barter it for cash,
is his own voluntary confession. That
this confession was made to a person
who was not to be cajoled or intimi
dated into secrecy was unfortunate for
Wright, but extremely fortunate for the
people of the State.
When the particulars of Wright's re
treat into the Burns camp become
known the exact degree of his infamy
will be apparent. At present he ap
pears as a. common scoundrel who, hav
ing sold himself, refuses to stay bought.
The reason for this refusal may, when
it becomes known, make him eligible
to the society of frequenters of the
health resort at San Quentin.
Alden Anderson, Speaker pro tern, of
the Assembly, furnished some of the
most sensational testimony of the day.
He related to the committee of the cir
cumstances of a visit he made, subse
quent to his nomination, to the office of
Mr. Grant and Mr. Green in San Fran
cisco. After introducing him to Mr.
Grant, Green took Anderson into a pri
vate office and proposed to bear his
election expenses, the understanding
being that Mr. Anderson should sup
port Grant for Senator. Mr. Anderson
declined the offer and was about to
leave the room when Green stepped in
front of him and offered him a handful
of double eagles with the remark:
"Well, take these along with you, any
way."
Mr. Anderson did not "take them
along" and he did tell the committee
the facts to-day, to which he added
some observations that were natural
enough to an honest man who has been
offered a bribe by an unscrupulous per
son.
James P. Brown, who, with Green,
shares the confidence and the finances
of I". S. Grant, was also one of the wit
nosses before the investigating com
mittee to-day. He gave evidence of a
remarkable loss of memory and at
times he seemed to have forgotten his
own identity. In brief his testimony
was to the effect that Grant had pour
ed money into his lap in exchange for
experience, but he was not sure the
amount exceeded one thousand dollars.
He had used the money, he said, in
paying hotel bills and traveling ex
penses, the latter item including a trip
East to see Steve Elkins and others in
the interests of Grant's candidacy. He
did say, however, that he had learned
that ex-Secretary of State L. H. Brown
was seeking to intimidate Grant's
supporters in the Examiner by telling
them if they continued to vote for
Grant they would be debarred from
any participation in the patronage of
the administration.
A verbatim report of all of the pro
ceedings before the committee to-day
is printed in full in this issue for the
purpose of giving to every man, women
and child who can read in the State an
opportunity of Judging for themselves
of the facts as they are brought^ out
by the investigators.
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1899.
DIRECT OFFER OF GOLD
BY MILTON J. GREEN
And he (Green) tried to persuade me that it was Mr. Perkins' wish that Mr. Grant be
elected United States Senator from Southern California, and he attempted to show me some
letters, but I paid no attention to him, and he went on and said that he was lending some as
sistance to candidates and would like to assist me in my canvass. I told Mr. Green, as near as
I can remember, or words to this effect, that he did not know me very well, but it was no use
to make that kind of a proposition to me; that when I could not go to Sacramento as
a free moral agent, to act as I thought right and just for the best interests of the people that
I went there to represent, I would not go at all; I was willing to be defeated.
And with that I started to leave the room, but in the meantime Mr. Green had been
fumbling at a drawer or something, and he stepped around in front of me and said: ''You
had better take this, anyhow." He had a handful of $20 gold pieces, but I walked past him
and out, and from that day to this I have had no further conversation with him.

M'lt c.REEn'S TESTIMONY ...
THE BURNS GANG
OF DISREPUTABLES
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 18.â The black cloud over
the camp of Grant does not brighten th?
prospects in the corral of the touts. It
LÂ« true that public attention at this time i
Is mainly directed to the scandulous use'
of money by Milton J. Green to advance j
the Senatorial aspirations of U. S. Grant
Jr., but this does not signify that the peo- !
pie are in a frame of mind to overlook
the unworthy public career of D. M.
Burns. On the contrary it will arouse in
the public a sentiment against the promo- i
tion of any corrupt and disgraced man to
the high position of United States Sena
tor.
A few days longer Herrin of the South
ern Pacific and Major McLaughlin, mis
representing the Republican State Cen
tral Committee, may hold Dan Burns in j
the contest for Senator, but they cannot |
hold them there after the moral sense j
of the State is aroused against his aspi- j
ration. Letters and messages coming
daily to members of the Legislature sig
nify that the people have a deep concern
in the selection of United States Senator.
Le Barron of Sonoma, Clark of Santa i
Clara, Dunlap of San Joaquin, and many
other members have he.ard from their I
constituents and know full well that the
people whom they represent would re
gard the success of Burns in this fight as '
a disgrace to the State. Republicans are j
convinced that Burns' election to the
Senate would be a blow to the party i
from which it could not recover in the
next four years.
The touts behind Burns hope by prac
tices of delay, the obstruction of business I
in the Legislature, and the representation j
that State patronage is at the disposal
o" Dan Burns, Major McLaughlin and
Paris Kilburn to wear out the patience S
of the Senate and Assembly and force :
the legislators' vote in caucus to end the
Senatorial contest. To counteract this
pressure and break up this programme,
whlcti is hardly less scandalous than the
purchase of votes, the people at home
should advise their representatives to
stand firm. Two ballots were taken in the i
joint convention to-day, ami special effort j
was made by each candidate to parade tue
full strength of his forces. Burns could
not line up more than twenty-five men.
Hints are cast about that he has eight
or ten men staked out among the voters
for Barnes, Bulla.Van R. Paterson. Knight
and ethers. When a close study is made
of the names of the men voting for these '
candidates the claim of Burns is found to
be empty boasting. A close Inside study !
of the situation leads to the conviction
that Bums is in a desperate strait. He
expected a breakaway from the Grant col- j
uu:n to-day, but, in that expectation, ne j
met disappointment. When the inevitable I
'jr-.-jk comes, for Grant Is a dead duck so
far us the Senatorial contest goes, his
strength will go to General Barnes,
Thomas Bard, R. N. Kill la or some other
candidate whose public career is not odi
ous to the people.
Several of tho low-down, disreputable I
touts that formerly haunted the head- !
quarters of Burn? have gone back to San j
Francisco, and their places here have i
been filled by men who are a grade higher j
In the outward forms of decency. The I
new-comers on the scene fancy that an
apology is flue for their presence in sup- I
port of Burns, hence they say that they !
are supporting the "organization," mean- |
ing thereby the organized committee ap
pointed to manage the secret Republican ;
campaign against the fusion party.
As this contest for United States Sen- !
â  ator is a struggle among Republicans and j
not against an opposing party, the "or- ;
ganization" has no business to interfere i
on behajf of any candidate. General i
Barnes is a Republican and a leader in j
' the party. R. N. Bulla is a Republican ;
i and a stanch one. Burns is a Republt
can when the Republicans have a good i
I chance of winning, but he sulked in his
tent during the great campaign for-Mc-
Kinley and gave nothing to the cause for
the reason that the sound money doc- i
trines of the party did not accord with ;
his notions of policy. If he were as good \
a Republican as his competitors in this j
fight the "organization" would have no I
right to espouse his cause.
The establishment of Republican head
quarters in the Golden Eagle to boom Dan !
Burns for the United States Senate is
an insult to every Republican in Califor
nia who is not lined up in the Burns pro
cession. The McLaughlins. the Step
pachers, the Shaens, the Kilburns, the !
j Watts and the rest of the crowd com- :
j prising the "organization" have a right I
to be here as Individuals and to express
their preference for Dan Burns, but it is !
downright impertinence on their part to
assume that the Republican organization i
is behind Burns. In order to clear the '
Senatorial contest of this disagreeable In
cubus the Republicans of California may
be compelled to call a meeting of the !
State committee and aboÂ»Â«sh the Sacra
mento headquarters.
Speaker Howard E. Wright is supposed i
to be in the Burns fold to stay. He ex- ;
amined closely the charges of dishonesty
preferred by the Grand Jury and the press !
against the candidate of his choice, and i
reached the conclusion after reflection
and deliberation that the colonel was a i
much maligned man. Wright formed the
judgment that Burns was honest and up- i
ri^ht. This indorsement has not yet '
caused members of the Legislature to de- I
sert other candidates and rally around j
I Dan. The next touch needed to complete
the picture Is a tribute from the colonel
to the high moral character of Speaker
Wright.
JOHNSON VOTED ALONE
AGAINST THE CHARTER
â
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- i
MENTO, Jan. 18.â San Francisco's char- I
ter has gone booming through the Assem- |
My without meeting anything more seri- â¢
ous in the way of opposition than the j
threatened speech and contrary vote of !
] Grove L. Johnson of Sacramento. Both :
> were Ineffectual, the vote standing 67 ayes '
1 no.
Mr. Johnson's forensic effort was not as
! glittering a success as it might have been
.had he been well posted on the subject!
lof his harangue. Having had the advan- '
tage of only a short residence in San !
Francisco, and that prior to new charter
history, he was not well stocked with any- â 
I thing save generaltles, and he found some â¢
difficulty in resolving them into the two
specific objections he gave tongue to. Mr '
i Johnson's arraignment was from a purely
: Sacramentan standpoint, and resulted
i only in giving Assemblyman Valentine of I
i Los Angrles and Works of San Diego an !
I opportunity to come gallantly to the de- '
Â£VTTPKrIEY DEVUN6,jHAiR,
/ABO COLOR^
TO THE
-SCENB
fense of the northern city and her scheme
of government.
"I have two objections to this charter,"
plainted Mr. Johnson. "One is that it
provides that the next election shall fall
in 1S9!), and that all subsequent elections
shall occur every two years. This brings
the elections in the odd-numbered years,
and our State law provides that registra
tion must be effected in even-numbered
years, and in this way voters will be prac
tically disfranchised. This matter is the
woof, the web and the warp of the whole
charter and in my opinion invalidates the
wthole document,
"Another objection I have is that all
officers appointed hold office during the
pleasure of the appointing power. This is
unconstitutional,'' and Mr. Johnson
pulled his lawbooks to prove it.
Assemblyman Valentine evidently did
not know how to explain to himself Mr.
Johnson's peculiarly antagonistic position
and he got up to say so.
"I don't Bee," said Mr. Valentine, "just
what all this talk is for of unconstitu
tionality. This Legislature can neither
amend nor curtail the charter. It is sim
ply our duty to puss and give it the seal
of the State. The people of San Francisco
elected to frame their own organic law,
and they have done so and have sub
mitted it to us in order that it may be
legalized, and I shall certainly vote to
give our San Francisco friends what they
want."
Assemblyman Works said that San Di
ego and his section of the State were for
the charter, and it would give him pleas
ure to vote for it.
Then Speaker pro tern. Anderson shut
off further debate by putting the ques
tion, and the rollcall developed just two
votes against itâ Johnson and Charles
Kenneally of San Francisco. Kenneally's
vote, however, was not cast to beat the
charter, but to win a wager of a half
dozen good cigars he had laid with
Charles L. Patton that he wowW voie
against it. Kenneally got his cigars, and
gave notice that he changed his vote from
no to aye, and there was something fur
ther on Patton when the charter crowd
finally got to the Golden Eagle. Upon mo
tion of Dibble of San Francisco the char
ter resolution was immediately dis
patched to the Senate, where it is said
Johnson will find no second to his opposi
tion.
WILL IMPROVE THE
QUARTERS OF CLERKS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 18.â George Root, the newly
elected Clerk of the Supreme Court, is
to live in the lap of luxury during the
term of his office: if it can be arranged by
legislative enactment. A bill was intro
duced in the Assembly this morning by
Assemblyman Cobb or San Francisco
that appropriates $11,000 to be expended
in furnishing the court clerk's office with
metallic files, bookcases and all the other
furniture necessary to business and solid
comfort. The bill was at once referred to
the* Ways and Means Committee and it is
understood that it will be pushed through
to its final passage as rapidly as the con
gested state of business will permit.
Belshaw of Contra Cofsta also got in
good work for the Supreme Court em
ployes with a bill that raises one of the
six deputies to the rank of chief deputy
and his salary from JISOO per annum to
$2400 per annum. It also carries the regu
lar appropriation for the salaries of the
deputies and stenographers. It is being
considered by the Ways and Means Com
mittee.
ALL THOUGHTS ARE
NOW CENTERED ON
THE INVESTIGATION
Legislative Proceedings Go On in a Most
Listless Manner.
COMMITTEE AN EARNEST BODY OF MEN.
A Determination Shown to Get to the Bottom of the
Senatorial Scandals Without Fear or Favor
to Any of the Wrongdoers.
BY HENRY JAMES.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- |
MENTO, Jan. 18.â There is no wild ex- j
cltement in watching the progress of a ;
ballot for United States Senator when a
similar ballot has been caf t from two j
to four times daily with the certainty of j
the arrival of the noon hour. To-day
there were two ballots, perfunctory, list
less, with no defection, even the little j
candidates with their suggestion of sup- j
port appearing in the same strength. |
Everybody was glad when a motion to !
adjourn was made, and it was carried
without dissent. There was a general
feeling that no change would have been
recorded if the members staid in their ;
seats all day. They are waiting, for ;
what Ido not know. They, do not know ;
themselves, but. that a break is coming j
soon nobody seems to doubt. Perhaps a i
good deal depends upon the work of the |
investigation committee which is engaged j
in trying to ascertain all the truth about j
Speaker Wright.
Any observer of this committee would j
be. bound to regard it as a sincere and
earnest body of men, working without j
fear and with no intent of shielding. The I
members seem to have a clear idea as |
to their duties. They are evidently law- j
yers or close students of legal methods.
None of the questioning is irrelevant, and
if the attorney for a witness breaks in j
he is quickly convinced that while he
may advise he must not attempt to die-
This evening Speaker Wright is on the
stand. He came into the room this after
noon and announced that he was ready
for the ordeal, but the committee was
not ready for him. Green was wanted
first. Green had been on the stand in
the morning and refused to answer as to
the destination of certain moneys he had
sent to help the campaigns vl candi
dates.
W hile Wright was in the room I got
the closest look at him. The man is un
der a tremendous strain, and though ho
shows It in a drawn face and a nervous
manner, his bold front, studied though it
may be, shows him to be a person with
some courage. From the knowledge or
testimony already given, from his own
words, tnÂ« sworn evidence of unbiased
men, it seems to me there awaits him
inevitable ruin and disgrace. It is not
simply that he voted for Burns, but that
to ao so he violated pledges more sacred
than any political promiae, and accepted
money from a candidate whom he had
agreed to support and whom he did not
support. This element of ingratitude
leids a darker hue to the crime. A man
may take money for his vote, and tim
plv be corrupt, but to take the money
and not deliver the vote adds to the act
a despicable quality not to be condoned.
But when Green was wanted he was ab
sent and while a message was sent for
him James Brown was put on the stand.
Mr Brown has been an associate mana
ger with Green, but if the committee ex
tracted any information from him 1
failed to catch it. With a never-failing
regularity he affably failed to remember.
So far as the committee is concerned,
Brown is a bad witness, but his contin
ual "passing of the buck" to Green made
the information stored in the mind or the
latter assume a new value.
Meanwhile Assemblyman Raw had
come in and expressed a desire to make
a few remarks. He was told that later
he would have abundant opportunity.
Then Green came in and took the stand.
He was not loquacious. The questions he
had refused to answer in the morning he
still refused to answer. As to the fact
that money was used to help the fight of
various candidates Green makes no se
cret. He asserts that the money was not
wrongfully used and that in ten in
stances at least it went to assist candi
dates who did not know of it, and were
still in ignorance. Another question was
put which had to be added to the list he
declined to answer. It was in relation to
a sum of money sent to Mendocino
County. Green admitted freely that the
money had been sent, but said it had
gone to a gentleman not actively in poli
tics, and who this gentleman is he would
not state. Finally he was granted the
privilege of postponing his reply until to
morrow. The fact was brought out that
this particular money had neen carried by
Green"s typewriter, a lady. There was
an immediate disposition to summon her,
but the witness knocked out this plan by
quoting law to show her not a competent
witness. However, the committee is not
wholly satisfied, and there may yet be a
spbpena issued for her. If she gets here
and has no right to talk Attorney Bacon
will be on hand to remind her of it.
There is an evening session with
Wright on the stand. As he is the central
figure of the whole s*candal there ought to
be something in the nature of a climax,
at least a dramatic passage, but this let
ter cannot wait for it. He cannot cl.-ar
himself, for his own words have already
condemned him, and to deny would be
but to impugn his own veracity. That
his claim of having the Supreme Court
behind him in his change to Burns is
false has been clearly demonstrated,
while the declaration of non-belief in the
charges against Burns cannot be com
forting to the colonel, for a moral bill of
health from Wright would be about as
hard a blow as a man could receive. Just
as the matter stands nojj* and taking
chances on the verdict of ihe committee.
I would advise Burns to get Wright to
denounce him. This would be good poll
tics.
Senator Boyce has joined the ranks of
those who dislike newspaper men. His
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
resolution, Introduced to-day, will tend to
make this feeling mutual. He wants it
considered in executive session, but the
scheme failed of unanimous support. Sen
ators Dickinson, Braunhart and Short
ridge were not impressed with the idea,
and before Boyce gets through monkeying
with the buzzsaw he will have fewer lin
gers with which to point with pride to<2its
statesmanship.
In writing of men and measures in
times when politics is hot one may ex
poct occasionally to give offense, and may
even be led into error. "When the latter
experience comes to me I am ready upon
finding it out to say so. The other
day I was given to understand that Frank
M .Stone wa.3 here in tl.e interests of
Burns, and would not only spend
money, but was ready to spend
it for newspaper influence, and r~ady
to talk J to me. This would have
touched the soreness, the pr'de of
any writer, and in this columr. 1 re
sented it. I do not believe that Stone
ever sent any message of any k'mc to
me. and I never sent any to him, al
though both of us were sincere for the
time in the contrary opinions. That in
cident, paving the way to wrath. I made
some other statements concerning Stone,
thinking they were upon good authority,
which does not appear to have been the
fact, I was told that he had won Grant's
confidence, assuming to be friendly, and
to be able to control certain votes. I
learn by inquiry that he has been openly
for Burns ever since Burns entered the
field, and that as to one man he was
charged with attempting to control he
has not even a speaking acquaintance,
nor has he attempted to control any of
them. His friendship for Grant has not
been political. The statement that the
cost of the excursion with young Grant
had been paid by Mr. Grant I find to be
incorrect. The expenses were defrayed by
Mr. Stone himself, and later D. S. Grant
insisted on assuming a share which, de
spite protests, he paid to Mr. Stf>ne. Why
I touched upon such personal matters is
clear, but I intend to be fair always, for
if a writer is not fair his contributions
lose value. Therefore I have gone into
so extended an explanation.
As I close word comes from the Capitol
that Wright has confessed to having re
ceived $1650 from Grant's manager, as
charged in The Call. Having done this
he uncorked the vials of his indignation
for the benefit of an employe of this pa
per who had been the chief instrument
in exposing him. The way he called
names is said to have been little less than
picturesque. Probably this line of de
fense was suggested by Wright's attor
ney. Devlin. This lawyer Is one of the lot
who conceived the plan of getting the
counties of the State to cinch the State
for a lot of back taxes. It was a great
scheme, too, r.nd would have netted the
lawyers more than a half million, while
the counties would have got that which
is vulgarly and expressively known as
soup. To "The Call fell the duty of ex
posing this project also, and doubtless
the disappointed attorneys, prospecting
in the pockets where the fees are not,
are conscious of a feeling of pain. If this
is the case they ought to say so and not
delegate the duty to a Wright, who has
troubles of his own.
The ethics of politics axe . peculiar. I
have heard nobody deny that. money can
be legitimately expended by a candidate,
but that this money should be accepted
from a man to whom the candidate will be
bound after election is a proposition
which finds no defenders.
DOCKERY'S BILL TO
BE AMENDED
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 18.â The Dockery bill, which
has for its object the creation of a State
Food Inspection Commission, will prob
ably be withdrawn by Its promoters or so
amended that instead of creating a new
commission it makes the proposed bursau
one of the departments of the State Board
of Health.
Dockery's bill has been pretty generally
and favorably discussed by the papers of
the State since it was introduced into the
Assembly in the early days of the session
and has the goodwill of most of the legis
lators, but Mr. Dockery has come to the
conclusion that just as much good can
be accomplished and with less cost to the
State by making it a department under
the State Board of Health, rather than a
commission by itself, and intends to so
amend it. It is at present in the hands of
the Judiciary Committee.
JOHNSON WANTS TO
RELIEVE HIS CONSTITUENCY
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 18.â Grove t,. Johnson came
to tho front In the Assembly with still
another of his pet "expenditure bills."
This time Mr. Johnson wants to spend
$15,000 of the State's good money in fur
nishing the State library, one of the best
furnished departments under the Capitol
roof. His bill provides that the money
shall be spent in buyinK metallic desks
and files and ornamental stairways and
"other furniture that may be needed";
it also provides that it shall not be neces
sary to contract for the things bought,
but that they may be purchased out of
hand. Mr. Johnson's furniture bill is in
line with that other one he introduced
the other day which provides for the
cleaning o* the granite on the Capitol.
Both are evidently measures for the re
lief of an underfed constituency. The

UNFINISHED TESTIMONY
OF W. S. LEAKE ON TUESDAY
Q. You said Mr. Grant, then.
A. No, Mr. Wrlgrht. Mr. Wright had
been there during his absence and re
mained till Mr. Green Â«ot back.
Mr. Baconâ Now, when he got back,
whoever was there told Mr. Green that
Mr. Wright was for Grant. Is that right?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Did Mr. Green ever tell you, during
' these conversations on Friday, Saturday
-or any other time, how long ho had been
acquainted with Mr. Wright?
A. No, sir.
Q. He said that Mr. Wright, during all
this time from the. time he first met him
in his office, at the time you have just
spoken ofâ that Mr. Wright was for
Grant, didn't he?
A. He told me that "Mr. Wright told
me he was for him." Oh, at that timeâ l
do not know whether he knew Mr. Wright
before that time or not.
g. 1 say from that timeâ that Is, the
Bret time you state thereâ from that time
he understood Wright was for Mr. Grant?
A. My acquaintance with Mr. Grant was
very limited. I had only met the gen
tieman a short time ago. I do not know
what his relations have been with Mr.
Wright, at all, other than at the time
Mr. Green tells me about, where he met
him.
}fr. Baconâ ls it not a fact that your
conversation with Green ihut you nave
detailed was to this effectâ that ho 'went
to his office on this occasion, the ilrst
time ;hat he connects himself and Mr.
Wright together, found Mr. Wright there,
and about the rirst thing that he was ap
prised of when he got to his office was
thai Mr. Wright was favorable to Mr.
Grant ?
A. Apprised? Well, he was apprised
that Mr. Wright was there and was for
Grant and wanted money- to .make his
campaign. *.' . ' '. fÂ£
Q. Wanted money to make his .7 cam
paign? . . .- â¢ " â¢â¢
a. .Yes, sir, and got it.
Q. And had been for Grant ever since
that time, and., had always been for
Grant? V . â¢
A. Mr. Green told me he was always
for .Mr. Grantâ until he commenced to
vote.
Q. As he understood it?
A. Yes, .sir.
Q. And he did not vote for Mr. Grant,
either?
A. That Is my understanding.
Mr. Banfordâ When you and Mr. Wright
had one conversation, he said he got
wasn't it?
A. Vis, sir.
\ipl he saiil to you, "You know how
much" or "You know how much the other
fellows got?" and who did he mention?
A. He mentioned the name of Senator
Cutter.
Q. Did he state how much Senator Cut
ter got?
X. No sir.
Q. Did ne state how much any other
party got?
A. No, sir.
Mr. Devlinâ May I ask one question?
Did Mr. Wright explain to you in that
conversation, Mr. Leake. that ho had bor
rowed this money from Mr. Green and tnat
the money had been paid to discharge an
obligation of Mr. Wright's to a gentleman
in Alameda County?
A. No, sir.
Q. He did not. Did he tell you in that
conversation that he was still Indebted to
Mr. Green for this money and would pay
it?
A. He told me he was going to pay it
back because he could not keep his agree
ment to vote for Mr Grant.
Q. Dic> l.c use that language?
A. He said he had promised to vote for
Mr. Grant, and "circumstances have i
arisen that I cannot, and I think it is
honorable that I shoulQ return the
money."
The chairmanâ ln this conversation with
Mr. Green did he ai any time state to
you as to how much money Mr. Cutter,
this other gentleman you have men
tioned, had received; or did he say any
thing about that?
A. No. I don't know fhat Mr. Green
has ever mentioned Mr. Cutter's name to
mo in any connection that would concern
this committee.
Q. Or Mr. Raw, or any other member
of the Assembly?
A. 1 decline to answer.
Mr. Lardnerâ Upon what grounds?
The chairmanâ Let us make this clear.
Mr. Lardnerâ On what grounds, Mr.
Leake?
Mr. Mellickâ What was the question? I
did not hear.
The chairmanâ Tho question is Intricate
and involved with another, so I will make
the question definite: In any conversa
tion that you have had with Mr. Greon
has he at any time detailed to you any
amount of money that he has expended
in behalf of any member of this Assem
bly?
A. Now, Mr. Chairman, I think k is due
to me to at least consult my attorneys.
Mr. Mellickâ Maybe I can get at it an
other way, Mr. Leake.
A. Mr. Mellick. there aro certain things
told to a man in confidence-
Mr. Mfllirkâ Well, I am trying to get
around that in this way: Mr. Grant and
Mr. Green were very anxious to get the j
support of The Call, were they not?
A. Now, Mr. Grant never spoke to me
upon the subject in his life. I only met j
him once, and it was just simply a friend
ly little talk. I do not know that the !
Benatorshlp was ever mentionedâ that is
Mr. Grant.
Q-. Well, when Mr. Green saw you, you :
understood that he was acting for Mr. I
Giant? 'â ,
A. Yes, sir.
â¢^. Well, he came to you as manager of
. The Call to get your support for Mi.
Grant, did he not?
. A Yen, Bir.
. . y. When was that?
: ' A. Since I came to Sacramento; sine*
â  the Legislature convened.
Q. And what did you say?
A. I told him that 1 was not the owner, i
â¢and I war- simply carrying out my in-'
structions; that th>-n> was but one man
I knew of who could change the policy of 1
the paper, and that was Mr. Spreckels, i
and he would have to see him.
Q. Did you tell Mr. Green that you
didn't think Grant could win, or words to
that effect?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And what did you ask of him then? )
A. Well, really I don't know. You would i
have to jog my memory a little on that, i
Q. Well, did you doubtâ in some- wordsâ '
â  doubt his ability to gel as many members j
to vote for Grant as he claimed?
' A. Yew, there wasâ l think the claim !
was 33 or 35â somewhere along there. I j
doubted that. I do not know as I ex
pressed that to Mr. Green.
Q. Did Mr. Green then furnish you with
a list of the Assemblymen â the names of
themâ those who were going to vote for
Mr. Grant?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did he furnish you a list of the As
semblymen in whose vote he had putmon
ey. or Mr. Grant had put money
A. He did not.
Q. Haven't you or The Call some such
list now?
A. I have not.
Q. Did you not say that there was such
a list in existence?
A. I have had it from good authority
that there was such a list, but I did not
want to see it and I have not seen it.
cj- Who was that good authority?
A. Now, you are getting right back
again to where you went loose a while
ago. Two or three people told me about
it, and really, Mr. Mellick, I don't want
to refuse "to answer any of your
questionsâ but I meet men every
day, and they tell me about the
number of people they have got.
Mr. Burns' men tell me they have
got all the members of the Legislature
and all that, and I don't think you ought
to require me to repeat those conversa
tions.
W No, as a newspaper man myself, I
regard as sacred certain confidences; but
at the same time, to be plain, I have
heard that Mr. Green wanted the support
of The Callâ it was time for them to get
in this fightâ and that you said: "I don't
think these men will stay with you,"' and
that Mr. Green said: "Here are the men;
here are the names"â and gave you a list
and said, "Here are the men" into whose
right he had put money, and that you had
heard of such a list or that there is such
a list to be obtained. Do you know of
such a list?
A. I probably know of it, same as you
do, Mr. Mellick. You know the people
have been talking about the list; and if
there is such a list in existence probably
The Call could have obtained possession
of It had it been disposed to support Mr.
Grant for United States Senator.
Q. Did it obtain it?
A. Not to my knowledge. I referred
Mr. Green to Mr. Spreckels, the pro
prietor of the paper.
The chairmanâ Do you know of any
body who has the list of the names of
members of this Legislature of whom it is
said that Mr. Green paid money for their
election?
A. I know of no such list in existence,
Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Mellickâ Well, it is your best In
formation that Mr. Spreckels or The Call
has some snch a list?
A. I don't think Mr. Spreckels or any
member of The Call staff has any such
information in their possession, because if
the/ had it they would â¢certainly refer it
to me.
Q. Well, as I understand it, then, you
simply wanted to ask your attorney as to
whether you shall divulge this high au
thority that knows of such a list?
A. No, sirâ no, you asked me if Mr.
Green ever spoke to me about paying
anybody's expenses, and I asked to be
excused.
The chairmanâ l asked if Mr. Green
had ever told you of having put any
money into the campaign of any one of
the members of this Legislature, and you
declined to answer, as I remember. I
may not have it worded as I had it at |
first.
A. Not out of any discourtesy to the
committee, Mr. Chairman.
Q. Certainly; wo understand that, but i
that is your position, as I understand
you. That you do not desire to divulge
the names of any persons whom Mr.
Green has said to you that he assisted in
making their campaign. Am I right?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And that you declined to answer un
lessâ
A. Upon the ground that I don't think
it will throw any light upon this investi
gation that is now being made.
Mr. Mellickâ Well, Mr. Green did tell
certain parties?
A. I will have to decline to answer.
Q. (After witness consults with his at
torney) Do you still decline to answer?
A. Will you please Â«sk the question
again, Mr. Chairman?
The chairmanâ Did Mr. Green, at any
lime, stnte to you the names of members
of this Legislature for whose election he
had expended money?
The witnessâ Well, now, seriously, Mr.
Chairman, I don't believe the committee
cught to force me to answer that qu<--s
--tlcr; but my attorneys have advised thit
I must answer it.
Q. Wei). I want to consult on that prop
osition. The only question in my mind
is of whom it ought to be first asked. I
think it ought to be asked. I do not
krow that you are the proper party to
ask it of first.
A. 1 hope you will ask the other part".
The chairmanâ The committee decide
that you must answer the question, Mr.
Lrake.
The v< it nessâ Mr. Green told me on two
different occasionsâ
Q. Now start in by giving us the time
and place and persons present.
A. i cannot do that. It has not been
very long ago, because I have not known
Mr. Gieen very long. It is since 1 have
been in Sacramento.
Q. Since the Legislature sat?
A. Yes. sir. On two different occasions
tht* question came up about this man
or that man influencing certain members
of the Legislature; and Mr. Raw' 3 namt
came up. He told me that he had as
sisted Mr. Raw in his election finan
cially.
Q. Did he tell you in what amount?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did he tell you in what manner Green
i paid out the money?
A. No, sir. That is as far as it went,
oxcept to tell about certain people, in cer
tain parts of the county, that had got
| some â Dlllman Bros., or Fillman Bros.â
â  something of that kind, but I don't know
\ âpeople that I am not acquainted wit.;
: therefore, that nobody could influence Mr.
Raw away from Mr. Grant.
Q. Did he indicate to you in any man
! ner how much that assistance had cost
Mr. Grant?
A. He did not.
Q. Did he say viiat he had assisted then*
financially in the interest of Mr. Grants
A. He didn't put it that way.
Q. How is that?
A. He did not put it that way.
Q. Now state his conversation , exactly
as he stated it, as nearly as you can.
A. Well, simply that there was no fear
i but what Mr. Raw was going to stay
with Mr. Grant, because he had assisted
Mr. Haw financially.
Q. He?
A. Green.
Q. Yes; he. Green, had assisted Mr.
Raw financially?
A. Of course, I draw my inference from
it the same as you gentlemen can.
1 Q. Yes, all of us do that.
A. But I don't want to put words in
i Mr. Green's mouth.
; Q. His language was this, then, was itâ
' that Mr. Raw would vote for Mr. Grant
j because "I" assisted him financially in
, his election? Was that it?
A. Yfs. sir,
Q. That was the substance of it. Any
other member of the Legislature that he
mentioned?
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1899.
A. Thank Godâ no, sir.
Q. You mean to say, then, that Mr.
Green never told you that he had finan
cially assisted any other legislator in his
election than Mr. Raw?
A. And Mr. Wright.
Q. And Mr. Wright?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. In this conversation with Mr. Green,
did he say to you that he had assisted
Mr. Raw by paying the money personally
to Mr. Raw or to somebody for Mr. Raw?
What is the fact In that matter?
A. I have related the conversation as
near as I can remember it, Mr. Chair
man, that he had assisted him financially.
Now, what that amounts to, you are as
able to judge as I am.
Q. Did he say that he had assisted Mr
Cutter?
A. He did not.
Q. And you mentioned another name?
A. Mr. Jilson.
Q. Jilson. Did- he say that he had as
sisted Mr. Jilson?
A. He did not. Let it be understood
that these were the three names Mr.
Wright mentioned to me, not Mr. Green.
Q. I understand you. I wanted to find
whether Mr. Green had mentioned the
same names that you say Mr. Wright
had â
MILT GREEN BEFORE THE COMMITTEE.
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Leake, without telling
the high authority, cannot you tell us
something about that list? First, what
have you heard about it, anyway? I do
not want you to break any confidence,
but what have you heard?
A. Just simply a rumor that the news
paper men hereâ the reportersâ bring In
this information. They are sent out to
chase it down, and every other man that
you see has heard of a list of that kind,
or seen it; but you never can get close
enough to it to get hold of it.
Mr. Mellickâ Well, now that you have
consulted with your attorney, wouldn't
you just as leave tell that "high author
ity"?
A. I do not understand that I have con
sulted him on that point, and I think you
misunderstood me about having this in- |
formation from any high authority. I j
have heard quite a number of people dis
cuss the proposition. I have been told by
a number of people that there is a list in \
existence with thirty-five names upon it
that were going to vote for Mr. Grant
first, last and all the time. The fact that
they did not vote for him "first, last and
all the time" Is pretty good evidence that
that list does not exist; so we stopped j
hunting for it.
Mr. Mellickâ Xow, as Wright voted for i
Colonel Burns, and as we are authorized
to dig out any improper methods that i
have been used, do you know of any im- j
proper metnods used by Colonel Burns
In getting Mr. Wright's vote?
A. I know nothing- of the relations be- j
tween Colonel Burns and Mr. Wright.
The chairmanâ Did Mr. Wright in any
conversation that he had with you ever |
say anything to you or hint to you as to j
what those circumstances were that you i
have mentioned that he said had arisen j
that compelled him not to vote further j
for Mr. Grant?
A. No, I did not ask him what the con
ditions were.
Q. Did he ever intimate to you what
were his inducements to change his vote
from Mr. Bulla to Mr. Burns?
A. No. sir. I have only had the two
conversations with him that I have told
you about.
Q. You have had the purpose steadily
in view, on the part of The Call, to de
feat the candidacy of D. M. Burns?
A. That is the attitude of The Call.
Q. Do you know of any improper meth
ods used on the part of D. M. Burns to
secure votes to himself for United State*
Senator by any member or members of
this Legislature?
A. No. I don't know anything that was
done that was improper. If I did I would
publish it. We have published everything
about Mr. Burns we could get hold of.
The chairmanâ Do you know of any im
proper methods having been pursued by
any other candidate for United States
Senator in that matter?
A. No. sir; I do not.
Q. Can you point to persons or papers
that maybe broughtbefore this committee
whereby they may learn of the improper
use of money or other influences in the
matter of the election of United States
Senator?
A. No. sir. I believe I have told about
all that T know in connection with the
matter. Mr. Chairman. Now you asked
me if I knew of any other undue influ
ences being brought to bear. My atten
tion has been called to the fact of a state
ment published in The Call. I think it was
an interview witn Mr. Jilson and some
gentleman that came down to persuade
him to change his vote, in which it was
understood that the vote was changed in
consideration of some threat about not
getting ajiy State patronage. It was"pub
lic property and was published in the pa
per. However, I did not get the inter
view.
Q. Did you have any conversation with
Mr. Jilson?
A. No. sir.
Q. What member of your staff did have?
A. Thut I could not tell you. It was
published some time ago.
Mr. Mellick â Have you any facts In con
nection with the Clough and Dan Cole
episode?
A. No. The facts in addition to those
which were published in the paper, which
in subSta-co were: That Mr. Cole had
written to Mr. dough and agreed to pay
his election expenses, and Mr. dough de
clined it. All those things have been pub
lishedâall that we know about itâ in the
paper.
The chairmanâ Do you gentlemen desire
any further questions?
Mr. Baconâ Yes, I would like to ask a
quest on.
L. i>ir Ljeakc, yen say you had a con
versation with Mr. Green in which he was
speaking to you of the chances of Mr.
Grant's election. Did he at that time show
you a list of the men who would vote for
Mr. Grant?
A. No, sir; he did not.
Q. He has never shown you such a list,
has he?
A. No. sir.
Q. He has never shown you any list,
and never has claimed to have a list of
men that he has assisted by furnishing
them money for their election expenses;
has he?
A. No, sir.
Q. Except the two instances of which
you speak?
A. No, sir. Not at all.
Q. Never claimed that he had such a
list and never spoke of such a list; did
he? I mean Mr. Green.
A. Now, you have kind of run two
questions together there. He did tell me
that he had thirty-five votes that were
going to vote for Mr. Grant.
Q. I am asking you now about a list of
men that he had assisted.
A. Now, also, you have run two ques
tions together. I want to be understood.
He has never told me of any list, or his
assistance of any other candidates than
those that I have told you about to-night.
Q. What I wanted to have you make
clear was, that he never had claimed or
mentioned to you a list of names of men
whom he had assisted.
The chairmanâ That is all, Mr. Leake.
BALANCE OF TESTIMONY OF
MILTON J. GREEN TUESDAY
The report of the testimony of Milton
J. Green Tuesday night was not sent in
full owing to the lateness of the hour.
Following is the portion omitted:
Mr. Mellickâ How long since that As
sembly district was doubtful, that you
had to get a good nominee up?
A. Well, I don't pay it was doubtful at
any time; but I remember two years ago
that Mr. Wright was a candidate at that
time and It was deemed necessary or ad
visable by the Republicans to get an in
dependent Republican out of the way.
Otherwise Mr. Wright's election two
years ago would have been in dauger.
Mr. I^a Bai;eoâ Mr. Green, did you give
any other contributions to any other par
ties?
Mr. Lardnerâ Did Mr. Wright know that
you had funds of Mr. Grant in your
hands?
A. He rti'l not.
Mr. Melllck â I have not finished up my
questions. Now there is a point right
there; that they had to get an independ
ent candidate out of the way in order to
elect a Republican, when, as a matter
of fact, two years ago Mr. Wright re
ceived the largest Republican majority
of any member of the Legislature, and
that is an overwhelming Republican disÂ«
trict. Now you .simply* had to get his
nomination. I do not understand how
you can say that that money was con
tributed to the election of a Republican
to the Legislature.
A. Well, if Mr. Wright received that
nomination and was elected he would be
come a part of the Republican legisla
ture, wouidn"t he, if the Legislature was
Republican?
Q. If Mr. Pringle was elected, would
not he have been a part of it?
A. Yes. sir. But it happened that I
knew Mr. Wright and did not know Mr.
Pringle.
Q. Therefore because you knew
Mr. Wright your friendship was
great, and you were the manager for j
Mr. Grant. Did you not expect that j
your contribution of $900 would |
naturally lead to his voting for
Grant?
A. No, sir; not at all; be
cause Mr. Wright had said before
that â several months before that â
that if he were elected to the Legis
lature he expected to vote for Mr.
Grant.
Q. You wanted to keep up your
friendship P
A. I don't know what you call
it. It was simply a case of a friend
being a candidate for the Legislature
and I was willing to assist in secur
ing his election.
Mr. La Baree â You were sure that
you were aiding a Grant man then?
A. I certainly thought so, yes.
Mr. McEnerneyâ l would like to ask a
few questions.
The chairmanâ Very well.
Mr. McEnerneyâ Does Mr. U. S. Grant
keep a bank account in the city and coun
ty of San Francisco?
A. No, sir.
Q. Do you keep a bank account there?
A. I do not.
Q. Do you keep a bank account in Oak
land?
A. No, sir.
Q. Do you keep any bank account?
A. No, sir.
Q. Have you in the last eighteen
months?
A. No, sir.
Q. On what bank were the checks that
you received from Mr. Grant drawn?
A. Well. I don't remember. It was the
National Bank in San Diego, but I can
not remember the name.
Q. T'pon what bank was the check for
$750 drawn by Mr. Grant with which you
canceled Mr. Wright's obligation?
A. I presime on the same bank that he
was in the habit of drawing on.
Q. You have received divers and large
sums of money from Mr. Grant, have you
not?
A. Well, diversâ not' large sums.
Q. You have received many sums, have
you not?
Mr. Baconâ Mr. McEnerney is going
I clear outside of the examination that has
been made by the committee. All the
questions I asked were within the line of
questions asked by the committee. This
is outside of anything that has been
gone into by the committee itself.
The chairmanâ l understand that to be
the limitation. The attorneys are con
fined to the matters inquired into by the
committee. I intended to go into that
line somewhat, but I wanted to
finish up this particular matter with Mr. 1
Wright first in order that we will not
have too much confusion in the line of
our examination.
Mr. McEnerneyâ Have you any means
of telling what moneys or Mr. Grant you
paid out toâ
Mr. Baconâ Now. Mr. Chairman. 1 sub
mit that that question has been asked by
the chairman of this committee and it is
absolutely improper to allow Mr. Mc-
Enerney to ga into that question.
Mr. McEnerneyâ He taJd that he kept
no books of account and I want to ask
him if he kept any memorandum.
Mr. Baconâ He has already answered
that fully.
The chairmanâ Mr. Green, I understood
you to have answered me that when you
can secure your data you can then tell
how much money you have received from
Mr. Grant and how you have expended it?
A. Well, I don't know that I could give
the details of the expenditures. I cer
tainly can of the receipts.
Q. And that letterâ if you are given
time you can get that?
A. Certainly; anything that I have at
my disposal. I have nothing whatever to
conceal in the matter.
Mr. Mellickâ Does that memorandum re
fer to contributions to various legislative
candidates?
A. Oh, to county committees and every
thing of that sort.
Mr. Mellickâ Having contributed moneys
to county committees, did you contribute
any in Mr. Wright's district after he was
nominated?
A. Not a dollar.
Q. I do not mean for Mr. Wright, but
to the County Central Committee fund in
that district. As soon as he was nomi
nated, did you know whether that dis
trict was absolutely safe Republican?
A. Well, the subject was never men
tioned again between us.
Q. Well, you knew it as a matter of
fact, did you not?
A. Well, of course, I knew that when
the nominations were all made his nomi
nation was equivalent to an election. But
that fact was not determined for some
time, for the reason that there was con
siderable of an independent movement in
Alameda County this year and quite
strong talk about fusion nominations.
Q. How was it. Mr. Green, about that
&750? Was that paid before Mr. Wright's
election or after he was elected?
A. Oh, that was before his election.
Mr. Sanfordâ Well, after his nomination?
A. My recollection is that it was after
dip nomination; still I am not certain.
Mr. Mellickâ l think you said a while
igo that it was in November?
A. No; I paid that the obligations that
he owed were due in November and he
wished to anticipate that by asking me to
take it up.
Q. Can you get that letter here that he
wrote you?
A. Yes, sir.
The Chairmanâ And the check?
A. No; I have no means of getting the
" Mr. 'Mellickâ What did you say to Mr.
3rant when you went to him and got that
5750.
A. I think I showed him tho letter and
ie asked me what I thought about it, and
[ said it was all right and that I would
3o it.
Q. What did you mean by saying that it
â¢was all right? What did you mean by
that, that he was still friendly to Mr
Grant?
A. No; not at all. I thought that he
would refund it.
Q. You took no note or anything of that
kind?
A. There was his promise in the letter.
Q. You never got any note?
A. No.
The chairmanâ Was Mr. Wright at that
time financially responsible?
A. Well. I really do not know about
that. I think he was manager of the Cali
fornia Title and Trust Company at rhat
time, and I knew that he had stock in
that institution.
Q. He had recently gone through insol
vency, had he not?
A. I think it was two years ago that he
went through insolvency. To the best of
my recollection. I think he went through
about two years ago.
Q. You made no examination Into his
financial standing?
A. No. sir.
Q. You learned it on the credit of his
personality, and expected he would return
it?
A. Yes; I had his written letter stating
that he was on his way to Oregon, and
that he expected to close up that trans
action at that time, and that there would
be $2000 due him.
Q. You did not Inquire into the chances,
or whether his expectancy was based
on good reason or not?
A. No; I didn't stop to reason It out
that way. He asked me upon receipt of
the letter to telephone to his friend. He
gave me his name and the number of his
telephone In Berkeley.
Q. The man to whom the money was
paid?
A. Yes.
Q. That was Yeazell?
A. I believe that was the name.- It was
a very peculiar name. I knowâ one that
I had never seen before.
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Grant sent you money
at different times for two different funds
âdifferent purposesâ sent It to you by
checks on the San Diego Bank? Now I
suppose, not haVing any bank account in
Oakland or in San Francisco, you went
and got that cashed and carried the
money in your pocket?
A. No, sir.
Q. Then how could you make these
contributions? Take the Wright case?
A. Oh, if T had a check of $1000 or $2000
I would probably get it cashedâ probably
get $200 or $300 in coin and a certificate
of deposit for the balance, and I
would cash that from time to time as I
needed it.
Q. In what bank did you deposit money
that way and take certificates of deposit?
A. Well, I think it was in theâsome
times in the Crocker-Woolworth and
sometimes in the First National.
Q. In San Francisco?
A. Yes.
Mr. McEnerneyâ What bank in San
Francisco is the correspondent of the
bank in San Diego?
A. My recollection is that it is possible
more checks than one were bank checks
drawn by the San Diego bank on the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank in San Fran
cisco.
Mr. Baconâ Draft?
A. Yes; checks or drafts.
Mr. McEnerneyâ Payable to your or
der?
A. I presume so.
Q. You never had anybody else to in
dorse themâ you always got them for
yourself, did you not?
A. I always drew the money.
Q. And it was on your indorsement alone
that the money was paid?
A. Yes.
Q. It was not on Mr. Brown's?
A. No, sir.
Q. And the money passed through your
hands?
A. Yes, I think so.
Q. Some of it came by draft on the
Crocker-Woolworth Bank?
A. One, at least, and possibly more.
The chairman â How much was the
j amount of the one you have in mind?
A. Ido not remember now. It w:is ?*Â»*<
or $3000â something like that.
Mr. Lardnerâ -What was the largest
draft you received that you rememli'-r of?
A. Weil. 1 don't know. Ii may have
been S2OCHJ or $3006; it might have been !
$4000.
Mr. McEnerneyâ Were you in the habit i
of acknowledging the receipts of these j
drafts to Mr. Grant?
A. No, not always.
Q. Do you keep a press copies of all ;
your letters?
A. I keep press copies of all I write.
Q. And that you wrote to Mr. Grant?
A. Well. I think so.
Q. You have all his letters which he
wrote to you?
A. Yes.
Mr. Melliekâ You understand, Mr. Green, i
that the subpena that was served on you
orders you to bring all those papers here?
Don't you understand it BO?
A. I suppose that is the nature of the
subpenaâ yes.
Mr. McEnerneyâ I would suggest. Mr.
Chairman, that you request Mr. Grant to
bring his bank account.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. MeEnerney, is .this a
trial of the libel suit against "The Call?
Mr. McEnerneyâ Mr. Bacon, I am a cit
izen of the State of California, and these
gentlemen are representatives of the i
whole people, and I, as a citizen, suggest
when they are investigating these charges
they should adopt appropriate means of i
arriving at the truth, and one of them is
to bring Mr. Grant's bank account and I
his return check.
Mr. Baconâ Well, I make my objection I
to that statement on exactly the same i
grounds that you put your right to put
that statement. lam a citizen of the
State of California, and interested in this
Legislature.
The chairmanâ There is no profit in
your discussion, gentlemen. If you will
permit me we will go on with 'he work
of the committee. Ido not want to be '
harsh in these matters, but we do not
want to spend time in discussion between
the attorneys. This has got to be a per
sonal matter between you two, and not a
proper matter before "the committee.
Mr. Baconâ There is one more question
I would like to ask. As I understand i
your resolution, gentlemen, attorneys
are here simply for the purpose of pro
tecting witnesses, or parties whom they !
represent?
A. Yes, sir; that is right.
Mr. Baconâ And perhaps to suggest
something that he wishes to bring out
if it is his own witness?
The chairmanâ Yes.
Mr. BÂ»conâ That is the spirit of the res- i
olution, I understand, introduced by Mr. !
iviellick?
Mr. Melliekâ That is it.
Mr. Baconâ l have followed that exact
ly. In that line 1 merely want to ask
Mr. Green one question now that I think
of. Mr. Green, Mr. Leake in his testi
mony here to-night said in that conver
satlon had with you in the Del Paso I
saloon here in town you told him that
on one occasion you went to your office
In San Francisco and tnere found Mr. i
Wright in conversation with Mr. Grant.
That was prior to the time that any |
money had been advanced by you to him.
And at that meeting at your office Mr. :
Wright said something to "you about this
$200 to buy Pringle off. Was that true
or not?
A. No, sir; it is not.
Q. Did you have any such conversation
as that with Mr. Leake at this place, here
in Sacramento, or any other place?
A. To that effect?
Q. Yes.
A. Or In those words?
Q. Yes, or in those words.
A. I never told Mr. Leake that Mr.
Wright came to the office and Mr. Grant !
and I were there together, because he I
never did.
Q. He never did?
A. That is to the best of my recollec- !
tion. He certainly never came there wlun
Mr. Grant was in the office and said any- I
thing about Mr. Pringle, and I never told
Mr. Leake so.
Q. Did Mr. Grant know anything at all j
about your relations with Mr. Wright, or '
what you were doing for him?
A. No, sir; absolutely not.
Mr. Melliekâ Mr. Green, how long will
It take for you to get those papers here?
A, I do not know. 1 am very busy just !
now.
Mr. Baconâ What papers do you want, j
gentlemen? Do you want papers to show j
that he had paid Mr. Wright some money?
He had admitted that he paid him some !
money.
Mr. Melliek â No. We have only gone
into one branch of this matter, and we
want all the letters. Take that "Sutter
Club" letter of Mr. Wright. We want
all the letters that passed between Mr.
Grant and Mr. Green in reference to con
tributions in this campaignâ the Senato
rial campaign. All bank checks or drafts
that are obtainable by Mr. Grant.
A. Well, I have not any bank checks or
drafts, or anything of that sort.
The chairmanâ l think the subpena cov
ers every possible kind of data that
can arise. I meant it when I drew it. any
way, and he will understand his subpena.
And the only question in my mind now
is as to what time the adjournment of
this committee, and the examination of
Mr. Green, should be made to. I am in
clined to think that It would be better
for the committee if we would go on with
Mr. Green in the morning, and then wo '
will have to have an adjournment and I
have him before us again after he has got |
his data. There are lines of this examin
atton that T would like to go intoâ that I
would like to complete before we dismiss
him from the stand.
The witnessâ Gentlemen, before you
leave this branch of the case I want to
say, if I have not said it in terms before,
that I never gave Mr. Wright a dollar
of money to influence his vote in electing j
a United States Senator. I never ex- i
acted a promise from him that he would
vote for Grant for United States Sena
tor, and he never did promise me that he
would vote for Mr. Grant tor United
States Senator; and that there was no
considerai ionâ that the contribution I
made in that primary election over there
was in no sense a consideration for Mr
Weight voting for Mr. Grant.
Mr. Sanfordâ ln the meantime you were
not handing money out promiscuously to
people that were opposed to Mr. Grant? I
A. I can say on that question, if you I
wish it. that 1 made contributions dur- j
ing the campaign to gentlemen who were
elected to the Legislature who never
voted for Mr. Grant, never promised to
vote for Mr. Grant and who were not
aware that I made any contributions to
their campaign.
Mr. Melliekâ Will you be prepared to
go on with your testimony in regard to
which legislative districts yon have ex
pended money in in the morning without
reference to these other letters? Will
you be prepared to go on with that testi
mony in the morning?

THE MORNING SESSION
OF THE COMMITTEE
The committee met in room 16 of the
Capitol building at I<> o'clock a. m.
The following proceedings were had:
Senator Cutterâ Mr. Chairman, I see
by the testimony of Mr. Leake of The
Morning Call, given here last evening,
that he has cast a reflection upon my
character which is absolutely untrue.
The whole statement there that I ever
received any money from Mr. Grant or
Mr. Grant's manager is an absolute
and entire falsehood. And I demand
that I be sworn and allowed to testify
before this committee in vindication of
my character.
The chairmanâ Senator Cutter, the
committee will be obliged to follow
Borne kind of order in the taking of
testimony, and that order could not
well be broken in upon by having your
testimony injected at this time, but I
assure you that you shall have all the
opportunity you desire to refute any
charges that have been brought against
you.
Senator Cutterâ Well, Mr. Chairman,
that is all I ask.
The chairmanâ Wo will send for you
at any time that we can use your testi
mony.
TESTIMONY OF MILTON
J. GREEN RESUMED
The chairman â Mr. Green, in the con
duct of tho qprnpaJgn for Mr. Grant's Sen
atorial aspirations, had you the authority
from Mr. Grant to conduct a campaign in
euch manner as your judgment would dic
tate?
A. Absolutely.
Q. Was it your custom, in conducting
i that campaign, to consult frequently with
Mr. Grant about the matter?
A. No, sir.
Q. And in the payment of any money
that you might consider legitimate ex
penses for his campaign, or illegitimate,
that you saw lit.
A. 1 must except to the last part of the
question.
Q. There is no question yet, Mr. Green.
In the matter of the expenditure of any
money on behalf of the campaign of Mr.
Grant were you authorized to use your
own judgment exclusively in the matter
â â  of how it should be expended and for
what purpose?
A. Yes, sir. Excepting that I knew it
must be within the legitimate scope of a
j regular campaign. For Mr. Grant made
that positive statement, that he was per
fectly willing to have ny incur proper
'â  and legitimate expenses in conducting his
j campaign; but that he had no desire
whatever to purchase his seat in the Sen
ate.
Q. When did that conversation occur?
Before or after the campaign opened?
A. I think it was the first conversation
I ever had with him in San Francisco-
November, 1597.
Q. Now, in the conduct of that cam
paign, I understood you to say last night
i that you had expended money prior to
the primaries and subsequent to the pri
maries. Is that correct?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And in the expenditures you expend
ed money in the different districts where
in the legislators were elected?
A. Yes, sir. In some cases where they
were not elected.
Q. Did you keep a memorandum at any
time of the times and places that you ex
pended money in that way?
A. Not a complete memorandum; no,
sir.
Q. Are you able at this time to tell all
the places in which you paid money?
A. No, sir; I am not.
Q. You can some of them I suppose?
A. Oh, I think so.
Q. Kindly detail to the committee the
different districts in which you expended
money in behalf of the legislators who
were to be elcted.
A. Now, gentlemen-
Mr. Baconâ Just wait. Mr. Green. Mr.
. Chairman, I object to that question on this
1 ground: That so far as Mr. Green's tes
timony has gone, and so far as the testi
mony of any other witness has gone here,
it has not been shown that there has
been one dollar of money illegitimately
expended in this campaign of Mr. Grant's.
The chairmanâ That Is the point we are
after.
Mr. Baconâ Now, the question that you
j put at this time we object to as being
immaterial. We might just as well ask
every man in the Stateâ it is just exactly
as pertinent to ask every man in this
State whether he made a journey down
in Southern California and went to some
expense in the Interest of some candi
date for office. Because we regard it I
think it is regarded by everybody that
it is not only proper, and not onfy fair
and honest, but it is absolutely proper
that a candidate for United States Sena
tor should, contribute money to the cam
paign expenses; and he is generally re
quested to do po. and generally doe? do
so, and very often it is made a matter of
comment -- favorable comments upon the
candidacy of any man that he has con
tributed money to the campaign expenses.
The chairmanâ As a general proposition
that is conceded. No doubt about that.
Mr. Baconâ Now, Mr. Green has said
that Mr. Grant told him to make this
campaign and that he was willing to
spend money to make this campaign. Mr.
Green says that they put the money Into
this legislative flght, but with the distinct
understanding that there should be abso-MONEY AND CHECKS GIVEN BY GRANT'S AGENTS.
lately nothing done that was illegitimate
or dishonest; that he would not buy his
way into the United States senate. Mr.
. Green has already testifiedâ last
â¢ : i.jijjjhtâ that he never furnisned money to
/.anybody with the understanding or upon
â â¢/.â¢the promise, as a condition of furnishing
..'that money, that the candidate for the
â  Legislature should vote for Mr. Grant.
jyow, if this proceeding is to run into a
/..trial or an accounting of the amount of
p.- money that Mr. Green expended in all of
.-.those ways It seems to me that there Is
. no uestlon that the Investigation will
â¢.â¢â â consume time with no result at all. We
â â â¢.â wiil go clear outside of the resolution
.that authorized and created this commit
ââ¢-toe and will do nothing at all except to
â¢* drag along this Investigation to the detri
ment of Mr. Grant* campaign, when it
â¢ will not result in the disclosure of any
thing detrimental to Ms campaign. Or.
;.; that ground we desire that Mr. Green
.r shall not go into that any farther. If
.-".there Ie any specific place that Mr. Green
. -.used any money that you think is llte
-...gitlmate or improper it is perfectly proper
. -lur you to ask about it; but to introduce
/a- -dragnet here and drag this State from
; : ; .one end to the other, when the investi
....gation, or the Inception of this investi
;:.'gation, was a motion of Mr. Wright's,
;â¢. made In his own behalf, that his conduct
â \v;t>i respect to this flection should be In
vestigatedâwe think It is entirely im
r.'P.roper and uncalled for.
' â¢' The chairmanâ The opinion of the chair
â Is that the only safe way for this Leg
.â¢.'lsrature to get at that question Is to know
..where, money was expended first; sec
: :.ohdly, as to how it was expended, and
â â therefore determine whether it was prop
â¢-:ejMy expended or not. Gentlemen of the
:.-commitUe, the question Is before you.
â  : Mr. Mellickâ l think It is a proper ques
..'.rlon, Except perhaps by not putting the
Question in a general way you might be
â â¢g>i. and ask as to one district after an
' '.4)thf>râ Mr. Bacon did not seem to object
."â â tov.thatâ instead of asking Mr. Green to go
; : afiea.d and detail the whole thing
â¢/i-JThe chairmanâ That is the same ques
; tlon., only by a different method.
:',;The witnessâ Now, Mr. Mellick should
y.'Jtoake this exception, however, that It must
;â .>;.(>â¢ -.where money was improperly ex
. ;pe. ruled.
.:";;â  The chairmanâ No, I do not ask where it
:.-,.vas improperly expended, because I do
â¢li.ot Want you to be the judge. I want the
. <&mmlttee to be the judge of that.
. â  ÂMr. Mellickâ Taking th.? case of Mr.
-"Wright, It has not been shown yet nor
-rlVas- anybody decided yet that the money
. >vus Improperly used, and we are to be
y.*he judges of that after we get the testi
.;-.jri'ony In.
â .-V :Mr. Baconâ as I understand you.
:: Mr. ' Chairman, do you propose to take
. *ach Assembly district In this State and
: iisk Mr. Green if any money was expend
,-cd in that district? I think that you will
. liiui that there has been expense incurred
.\!n every Assembly district in the State
. Â«f California.
: -.- The chairmanâ That is very possible.
â â -,â¢.-. -Mr. Baconâ to ask Mr. Green to go
.-.lnto the details of that expenditure, it
.would be an utter impossibility. You can
r.Jjfeadlly see that it would be a matter of
."â¢absolute impossibility, and it is a futile
: thing for this committee to expect a man
. â :tw sit down and show exactly where
â¦â very dollar of money was expended in
-every Assembly district in this State.
:.-Jnow I do not desire to limit this investi
gation at allâ not desire to limit it or
â¢ di.cert It from any legitimate Inquiryâ
â¢â¢â¢.â¢But it seems to me, gentlemen, that in
' -.falrnefs to Mr. Grant and under a fair
: â ruction of your resolution, you are
.â t>ro.c-eetung clear outside of that fair con
struction when you go into that sort of
â¢thing when there has been nothing shown
,-;h?re except this incident of the payment
..of money to Mr. Wright, which Mr. Green
.â has already explained, which Mr. Leake
.ihns already explained, which Mr Wright
.jhjas.not explained. â 
.....Th' chairmanâ would not under
â fnJte to argue to this committee, Mr.
.7Â«4;con. that the resolution introduced in
- Â*np - Assembly confines the investigation
, : to .:â¢>.!.:'. Wright. You certainly do not
-'.mean that, when the resolution is so clear
â  as-; : it-Is. Your skill as an attorney will
. yjvow you better than that.
! â¢:-; Mr. Baconâ Yes, now I will raise that
- p.. and I have raised it twice be
f;\r*..as- to what scope this is to take.
;â  â .â The;. chairmanâ the chair told you
V.ttjjLt. t.hat must be a matter of develop
: . niem'f, '. â 
v Mr,: Baconâ l certainly have no desire,
â  â¢.-n-?.- Chairman, to attempt to control the
iji^tiph.of the committee. All 1 desire to
..l'.rjo.w was what that action should be. â¢
.:.r>jhe chairmanâ Well, we cannot tell you
,-m "advance, Mr. Bacon.
â¢ . : iM'r."Mellickâ ln order to get at the mo
â â .tjve" in the start I would like to ask a
â fiuostion of Mr. Green, and that is this:
:-;Hayr'-aoes it come that you paid money
' hv. ; t.he different legislative fights rather
: tTianl in the State Central Committee
â tuml? â 
>.; A/ 1 -can answer that question by saying
â¢ that. I he State Central Committee was In
â  tetjested in the election of the State ticket
proper and a Congressional ticket, and, so
â far. as I am aware, had no part In the
:;: fel-eotiqn or the campaign for the election
-.of.Hho members of the Legislature. Sec
:-ftn)lly.; the committee,. or at least the head
â  of- it/ was known to be unfriendly to Mr. â 
.Grant., and it would have certainly been
'very poor judgment for us to have per
.*;n>rttÂ£;d the State Central Committee to
i'h'a.ve -expended any money in the election
:'.q;f-'a Republican Legislature which might
':â  VJrriyve been unfriendly to Mr. Grant.
â¢â¢'â¢â¢. : -Q..' But. take for instance, the case of
: -Mr. -Wright. The $900 was put in before
..;bÂ£-waa nominated. Was it known then
: : 'that. .the head of the ticket was unfriend
â ]'y to Mr. Grant's candidacy?
: --A.. The head of the State Central Com
'..'Eilttc? was.
.... Mr. Mellickâ How does It come that you
:;-flld- not put the money into the campaign
â¢fund of the different counties, then?
. "A, "Weil. I did In a great many in
â :" stances. In a majority of the cases it was
â¢ done lust that very way.
â¢; Q. .And It has been accounted for un

â¢ . A. I do not know anything about that.
; - â¢'. Q. We have a purity of election law. j
â¢ Now, the money that was not put Into

â¢; counted for by the candidate, has it?
â¢ ; '- a. Ido not know. I have not under
itaiten to follow that out to its end.
. .Mr. Mellickâ Now, If we go to work

'â â â t)von accounted for in the purity of elec
â yttvi-n Jaws, it seems to me that would be
;.ftri:''iHi:Kitimate expenditure of money.
.A. It may be on the part of the com
; jfl'litf-i" or some particular person, but I
â¢â¢.riprtajhly did not contribute any money

"â¢A. And I think that we did more than
.other candidate to secure the return of a
'.â  Republican Legislature. I am not going
claim credit for the election of all the
.Tii'embers, but as I said before and repeat,
: we made the contribution in many In

irn'awledge of it: and where I found that
they were pledged for other gentlemen

â¢ shown that spending money or assist

to the Legislature is Improper and unlaw
ful 1 must decline to go into details.
The chairmanâ Now, Mr. Reporter, will
you kindly read the original question?
The reporter read the question as fol
lows: "I wish to ask you. Mr. Green,
with reference to the First Assembly Dis
trict of this State, wherein Mr. C. B. Jil-
BOn was elected to the Assembly, did you
assist In any manner in the campaign in
that district'?"
The chairmanâ Now. will you answer
that question without this general blan
ket answer:
A. Under the circumstances, Mr. Cos
per, I must decline to answer that ques
tion, not but what I can answer it prop
erly and satisfactorily, and I have no
personal reasons whatever for refusing to
answer it, because 1 do not consider that
1 have made a single Improper or illegiti
mate expenditure of money.
Q. Then on what ground do you , de
cline to answer?
Witness consulted ' with his attorney
(Mr. Bacon).
The chairmanâ On what ground do you
decline to answer the question?
A. Upon the ground that l do not thin't
it is a proper method for conducting the
inquiry.
Â«j. Sir. Green, did you on behalf of Mr.
Grant contribute anything to the .lec
tion of Mr. Marvin In the Second Assem
bly District of this State.
A. K>>r the reasons given in answer to
the previous Â«iuestion I must decline to
answer.
Q. Ar:d your declination is on the same
ground. I presume?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. Mr. Green, did you contribute any
thing on behalf of Mr. Grant to the elec
tion of Cyrus H. Hoynton from the Third
Assembly District in this State?
A. I decline to answer ror the same
â 
Q. Mr. Green, did you. on behalf of Mr.
Grant, contribute anything to the election
of VV. H. La Baree of the Fourth As
sembly District of this State?
A. 1 decline to answer that question for
the same reason.
Mr. La Bareeâ l would like to have you
answer that. Mr. Green.
The chairman-Mr. La Baree is a mem
ber of the committee and desires that you
answer it fully. Do 1 understand that
correctly, Mr. La iiarce?
Mr. La Baree â Yes, sir.
A. I have testified that in a number of
instancesâ (consults with Mr. Bacon)â
well, Mr. La Baree is present, and if he
desires to answer it, why 1 prefer that he
should do it.
The chairmanâ Well, we cannot have
Mr. La Baree's testimony now very well,
becaus. we cannot break up the testi
mony and interject portions from each
witness as the examination proceeds.
Mr. I. a BareÂ« â Mr. Chairman, I think
that Mr. Green should answer those ques
tions in regard to my district at least
The chairmanâ lt is your personal re
quest that be answer it fully with refer
ence to the district in which you were
elected?
Mr. La Bareeâ Yes, sir.
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Chairman, there is no
reason, as 1 can see, why he should not an
swer that question. Perhaps there might
be as to some of the other districts where
Assemblymen did not know anything
about it, and there might come some re
flection on him that was not warranted
under the circumstances. But here is
the Assemblyman in whose district Mr.
Green has said that he nas contributed
money, and it is no miure than fair that
he should say on the stand what he haa
said behind his back. And now. then, I
Insist that that question shall be an
swered, so that we can report to the Leg
islature at once if he refuses.
Mr. Baconâ What is that, Mr. Mellick,
that Mr. Green has said?
Mr. Mellickâ That he has contributed
moneyâ as I understand by hearsay, that
he has contributed money in La Baree's
district, and that was one of the rea
sons why we had better not probe into
this question, when he was going to tell
that there was money expended in Mr.
La Baree's district. Now. Mr. La Baree
does not want any protection from these
questions; he wants them to all come out.
Now, I insist that they shall.
Mr. La Bareeâ l think, Mr. Chairman,
as I uni a member of this committee, mat
I have a right to insist upon it.
The chairmanâ That is conceded at once
by the committee. It Impeaches the fair
ness of the committee if Mr. La Baree,
who is a member, cannot be cleared from
any imputation in the matter.
A. What is the question?
The reporter read the question as fol
lows: "Mr. Green, did you on behalf of
Mr. Grant contribute anything to the
flection of W. H. La Baree of the Fourth
Assembly District of this State?"
A. Well, as I said before, I do not de
sire to go into all those particularsâ not
that I have anything to conceal, because
1 have not, but in deference to Dr. La
Baree's presence and personal request, I
would say that I did. I sent $100 into Te
hama County to assist in the election of
Dr. La Baree.
Q. To whom did you send the money?
A. To Mr. Fred Ellis.
Q. What relation did Mr. Fred Ellis
bear to the campaign?
A. It was represented that he was an
active Republican in that county.
Q. Do you know anything how that
money was expended
A. I do not.
Q. Was Mr. Fred Ellis a member of the
Central Committee of that county?
A. I do not know.
Q. Or of the Assembly Committee of
that Assembly district, if there was one?
A. I do not know. .' .".'
Q. Did you have any conversation with
Mr. Ellis with reference to the election of
your United States Senator prior to the
sending of that money?
A. I never didâ either before or since.
Q. Had you at that timeâ at the time
you sent the money â had any conversa
tion with Mr. La Baree with refereence to
his feelings toward Mr. Grant's candi
dacy?
A. I never met Dr. La Baree in my life
until night before last.
Q. Had you had any written communi
cations with him?
A. 1 never had.
Q. Had you had any communication
with him indirectly through other people
with reference to that matter?
A. With reference to the expenditure of
monej ?
Q. With reference to his feeling toward
the candidacy of Mr. Grant?
A. I never asked anybody to write to
Dr. La Baree.
Q. That does not answer the question
quite.
A. What is the question? (The reporter
read the question.)
A. Perhaps I had better supplement that
answer by saying that T never at any
time spoke to Dr. La Baree In relation to
the Senatorial question.
Q. Before sending that money into To
hama County, had you had any indirect
communication-
Mr. Mellick (Interrupting)â Any knowl
edge?
The chairmanâ No, sir; pardon me. Let
me ask this and you can supplement it if
you please. Had you any indirect com
munication with Dr. La Baree by letter
or word of mouth whereby you learned
his feeling concerning the candidacy of
Mr. Grant?
A. I never had.
Q. You were absolutely without any
knowledge?
A. Absolutely.
Q. Of what his feeling was toward that
candidacy before you sent that money?
A. Absolutely. The only object I " had
was: I understood that Dr. La Baree
was a prominent citizen of Trinity
County: that he stood well among his
friends and neighbors; that the district
was a Democratic one and had returned
a Democrat two years ago. or a fuslonist,
rather, and it was at all times a close
district and favoring Democrats.
Q. Since you contributed that money,
has there been any pledge, promise or
understanding between, yourself and Mr
La Baree that ho should vote for Mr.
Grant by reason of the fact that you had
put money into his candidacy and fight?
A. Absolutely not. I never have men
tioned the Senatorial question to La Ba
re* in my life. 1 never met him until night
before last.
Q. That is true, though it might involve
an indirect method. You have not had any
such communication directly or indi
rectly?
A. No. sir.
Mr. La Bareeâ l should like toask that
Frank H. Stono be permitted to ask a few
questions In my behalf.
The chairmanâ Very well.
Mr. Stoneâ Mr. Green, Dr. La Baree re
quests me to ask whether directly or in
directly, by any means within your knowl
)<-dge. Dr. La Baree received Information
that there was any money sent either to
Tehama nr Trinity County to be expend
ed in his behalf?
A. Not to my knowledge and not with
my consent.
Q. Never with your consent nor to your
knowU-dge?
A. No, sir.
Q. Do you know, Mr. Green, of any
means by which Dr. La Baree received
any information that there was any mon
ey ever sent to either of the counties in
his behalf?
A. No. sir: 1 do not know that Dr. La
Baree had ever heard of it
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1899.
Mr. Stoneâ Mr. Chairman, in behalf of
Dr. La Baree, he desires to ask at such
time as it may seem proper for this com
mittee that the gentleman who has been i
named by the witnessâ l do not remember j
now the nameâ be subpenaed to give tes- j
timony as to whether he received any
money or not, or whether it was within j
the knowledge of Dr. La Baree.
The chairmanâ l do not myself want to
sit in iudgment on this thing at this time,
but It is. barely possible that Mr. La
Baree r s own statement to the committee j
might be convincing under the circum
stances, and it might be entirely satis- |
factory to the committee and the Legis- |
lature without the expense of sending up j
for Mr. Ellis.
Mr. Stoneâ The reason I ask on behalf
of Dr. La Baree that you subpena him
is that it has been reported in the last
few hours or days that Mr. Green had
sent $Uki In a letter to the gentleman
spoken of, and Dr. La Baree communi
cated with Mr. Ellis, and Mr. Ellis denies
it. That is the reason.
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Green, when you were
asked if you contributed money you only |
mentioned this one sum; you did not say i
whether there were anymore sums or not?
A. In Dr. La Baree's case?
Q. Yes.
A. That is all I ever sent.
Q. Was that all that was ever paid by
Mr Grant, so far ask you know, in that;
Fourth Assembly District?
A. Yes. sir.
Q Now, then, did you send, or by your I
directions was a letter sent up in the
Fourth District since the Senatorial fight I
began, saying that Mr. La Baree has
treated Mr. Grant shabbily; that you con
trlbuted money in that campaign, and i
that he refused to vote for Mr. Grant?
A. I never did. I never asked how Dr.
La Baree was going to vote, and I did
not know until he cast his vote.
Q There was such a letter sent up in
that district trying to get Mr. Ellis or
some one to influence Dr. La Baree to
vote for Grant, because money had been
contributed in that campaign, was there ;
A. Not that I have any knowledge of.
I never heard of It.
Mr. Mellickâ Was there not spch a let
ter sent. Mr. La Karee?
Mr. La Bareeâ Yes, sir; by Mr. Martin '
McDonald.
A. I never authorized Mr. McDonald to j
writ-' him such a letter, and did not know I
he had done so. Mr. Martin McDonald j
was very friendly to Mr. Grant and he |
- HILT GRttN . WITH THE ASSISTANCE'! OF __â
ATTORNEY .&ACOMÂ£ReFU6Â£V- TO ANiWER, -.
. . CERTAIN CJOEiTIOfAV**
told me once, or telephoned me once, that
he was your cousin and intimate friend
and that he was satisfied that he might
have some influence with you in the mat
ter and that he would like the privilege of
writing a letter, or he was going to com
municate with you. And I said, "All
right, 1 would be pleased to have you do
so."
Mr. Mellickâ Was there any reference
in that talk about the money that you
had contributed in that district?
A. No. sir.
Mr. La Baree â Mr. Green, how did Mr.
McDonald know then that the money had
been sent to Mr. Ellis when he did not
know Mr. Ellis or never heard of him?
A. Well, I do not know. It is possible
that the matter might have been dls
cussod some way or other. But I never
asked Mr. McDonald to write you any
such a letter. I had no knowledge that he
had.
Mr. Meliick-Do not you feel that Mr.
La Bare? is under obligations to Mr.
Grant now?
A. -No, sir. I have never asked him to
vote for Mr. Grant.
Q. I know, but do not you feel so now?
A. No, sir. I do not If I had I should
have asked him to vote for Mr. Grant
upon that ground.
The chairmanâ l do not know but that
you have answered this question that you
have no knowledge that Mr. La Baree
know anything about the expenditure of
this money In that district at all?
A. No, fir. On the contrary, I believe
that he did not know anything about it
and have so stated.
Mr. La Bareeâ l will state, Mr. Chairman,
that the first I heard of It was about
three weeks ago.
The chairmanâ Mr. Green, did you, on
behalf of Mr. Grant, expend any money
to aid In the election of James H. Beecher
of the Fifth Assembly District of this
State?
Mr. Mellickâ His opponent?
The chairmanâ Oh, yesâ l see, his oppo
nent. What answer do you make?
A. For the reasons given in my previous
answers I decline to make any state-
ment.
Q. Now, Mr. Green, it is worth nothing to
us to repeat the same form of question
every time. Do you refuse to answer the
same question with reference to each of
the Assembly districts?
Mr. Mellickâ Ask him as to Clough's
case.
The chairmanâ Oh, yes. I will ask you
whether, on behalf of Mr. Grant, you ex
pended any money in aid of the election
of G. G. Clough of the Sixth Assembly
District of this State?
A. Why do you wish to make an excep
tion of that case?
Mr. Mellickâ Because that has been
part of the â
The chairmanâ Public scandal.
A. Well, I am perfectly willing to say
in that particular Instance that I never
did, and I never authorized anybody else
to do so.
Q. Never expended any money?
A. No, sir; not a dollar. And I do not
believe a dollar was expended. I never
heard of it. >
Mr. Mellickâ What has been the con
nection of Dan Cole with you and Mr.
Grant in this campaign?
A. Simply that of a friend.
Q. lias he been authorized in any case
to spend any money in behalf of the leg
islative candidates?
A. Not that I am aware of.
Q. Did you put any money in his hands
to help In the Grant campaign?
A. Well. I thinkâ l am not certain
about It, but my recollection is that there
was at one time some money, but I will
notâ you referring to Judge Clough?
Q. No. 1 mean Dan Goleâ whether. Dan
Cole was given money at one time?
A. Well, I think so. He traveled around
with Mr. Grant. He went up with him
through Nevada, Yuba and Placer coun
ties.
Q. How much money did you give him
at that time?
A. I do not remember. I do not think
that he ever had to exceed four or five
hundred dollars all told.
Q. Four or five hundred dollars?
A. Yes, sir.
The chairmanâ Had he any instructions
as to how he should expend the money
you gave him?
A. No, sir: and I never knew how he
did expend it.
Q. He never reported to you?
A. No. sir.
Mr. Melllekâ Was Mr. Cole authorized
by you, by Mr. Grant or by Mr. Brown to
sound legislative candidates, or to make
any offer of contributing money In their"
campaign? > - 'â  .
A. I do not think so. I have no recollec
tion of It. I think that Mr. Cole said that
he had a number of friends who might be
candidates for the Legislature. He is
pretty well acquainted In a number of
mining counties. And. as I have stated
before, I accompanied Mr. Grant through
several of the. mining counties. And I
may say, in passing, that that was the
principal method of making this campaign
in behalf of Mr. Grant. â  â¢
â Q. Did Mr. Grant know of your having
given Mr. Cole money to advance his In
terests?
A. No, sir.
Q. Mr. Grant does not ask you as to
how you expend the money in his behalf?
A. No, he never has. He simply laid
upon me the strict injunction that he un
derstood there were certain expenditures
that could be properly made, that were
proper and lawful, legitimate and usual,
and beyond that he did not wish to go â
and I have followed that injunction to the
letter.
Q. Did he limit you to the sum total
that you could expend in that behalf?
A. No, sir.
Mr. Mellick â I have a question
that has been suggested by the an
swer he gave. You say that in those
districts where the legislators were
pledged to some other Republican
candidate for United States Senator
you did not expend any more money?
A. No, sir; I did not. I did not
know that I said that, but it is a
fact that I did not.
Q. Yes, you said that. Now, then,
if you were spending money simply
to elect a Republican legislator, how
do you reconcile that with the fact
that you were not willing that a Re
publican should be elected where he
was pledged to some other candidate
besides Mr. Grant?
A. I never said that I objected to
their election.
Q. No; but you did not contribute
money where they were pledged, to
somebody else â yet you were eager to
have a Republican Legislature.
A. I understood that they were
being assisted by people in whom
they were directly interested.
The chairmanâ l want to ask you, Mr.
Green, did you understand that they were
assisted by other people in whom they
were directly interested? In whose can
didacy did you understand that they were
directly interested â one or more of them?
A. Well, I am not here for the purpose
of furnishing information about anybody
elsi's candidacy.
Q. But you are here to answer the
questions of this committee, Mr. Green.
A. I have no desire whateverâ never had
any desireâ to stir up any scandal or to
I make any reflections upon any other gen
tlemen who are aspiring to the Senator
ship.
Q. Well, I ask you specifically, did
you understand at that time that any
of the candidates received any assist
ance in the interest of Daniel M.
Burns?
A. I understood that assistance
was rendered by Colonel Burns to
candidates for the Legislature, and
in the same manner that Mr. Grant
was making contributions.
Q. What candidates did you understand
were so assisted by him?
A. I do not care to answer that question.
Q. On what ground do you decline to
answer that?
A. Because it is simply hearsay.
Q. That is the only ground?
A. That, and the further ground that
the committee has a better method of
arriving at that result.
Q. Through what means did you under
stand that Colonel Burns was assisting
candidates in their candidacy in the
campaign?
A. Well, in several different ways.
Q. Name one of them.
A. As a matter of common rumor on
the streets of San Franciscoâ that is, at
least, in political circles.
Q. Any other way?
A. I think, in some instances, conversa
tions I had with friends of the candi
dates.
Q. You remember any conversation with
reference to the candidacy of any one can
didate?
A. Any one candidate for the Legisla
ture?
Q. For the Legislature, yes.
A. I cannot recollect now.
Q. You cannot recollect any?
A. Of course, these things I dhl not
charge my mind with. I had no desire
at any time to reflect upon Colonel Burns'
candidacy. I knew that he was doing
something that was considered proper
and was quite usual. And, as we were
doing the same thing, I certainly had no
desire to cast any reflection upon Colonel
Burns or any other candidate for Senator.
I knew that some of the other candidates
were contributing for the election of a
Republican Legislature by other methods
and that were considered proper and that
they expected to receive the votes of their
friends in the Legislature.
Q. Well, Mr. Green, do you know of
your own knowledge, or by common
knowledge, as it Is known, that Mr.
Burns put money, into the campaign of
any one of the members of this Legisla
ture?
A. I cannot say that I know it of my
own knowledge, because I was not pres
ent and saw no money paid. So I will
have to answer that I do not know it of
my own knowledge.
Q. Well, the question is double. It says:
Do you know it by common knowledge,
as it is known?
A. What is the latter part of the ques
tion?
Q. Do you know that fact by what is
known as common knowledge?
A. I certainly know it byâ to that ex
tent, yes.
Q. Can you point this committee to any
means whereby they may learn of Mr.
Burns having put money Into the light
of any member of this Legislature for
elections?
A. AVell, Colonel Burns is a truthful
man. Ido not imagine he has anything
to conceal. He probably would be will
ing to admit, a.s 1 have done, that he was
Interested In the election of a Repub
lican Legislature, and was perfectly will
ing to contribute to that result.
Q. You can point to no means, then, ex
cept the examination of Mr. Burns him
self?
A. Examination of Mr. Burns, or the
members themselves.
Q. That would be the limit of your
ability to direct us to testimony?
A. Certainly.
Mr. Mellickâ Do not limit it to Colonel
Burns. He said as to other candidates.
The chairmanâ Well, particularly that
one.
Q. Now, I will ask you if you have any
knowledge of any other candidate for the
United States Senate having put money
into the candidacy of any member of this
Legislature other than those you have
spoken of. viz., Mr. Grant and Mr. Burns?
We have exhausted that side.
A. No; I cannot say that I have. Of
course I know that they contributed to
the election of members of the Legisla
ture, but whether it was done In a finan
cial way or by personal influence In the
district or speaking in the district, why
T am not prepared to say. I think prob
ably that was done.
Q. I am speaking particularly of put
ting money into the fight. Do you know
of any other candidate for United States
Senator â other than those you have men
tionedâhaving put money into their can
didacy of any member of this Legisla
ture?
A. Not of my own knowledge; no, sir.
Q. Can you point us to any method of
learning whether they did or notâ that is,
not a matter of your own knowledge?
A. Except by calling the gentlemen
themselves.
Q. And the people whom they assisted?
A. Yes.
Mr. Mellickâ Do you know any man by
name who presumes to know that Colo
nel Burns or any other candidate put
money into the fight of any legislative
candidate?
A. Well, I suppose that Colonel Burnsâ
Q. No; I mean outside of himâ any other
man that presumes to know?
A. Oh, I would not pretend to say that
I could give any authorityâ l cannot. It
is one of those things that came to me as
one of the incidents of the campaign, and
it is always looked upon as legitimate
and proper. I never have given it a
thought.
Q. The reason we want to know is, Mr.
Bacon last night said that this investiga
tion seemed to be directed at Mr. Grant.
We want to get it from his own witnesses
and Mr. Grant's own witnesses that that
Is not true. We want to find out all the
truth In regard to this matter, of all can
didates, therefore I asked that question
very specifically of you to refute the
charge made by Mr. Bacon last night.
A. Well, I am certainly not here for the
purpose of making any charges against
Colonel Burns or any other candidate. 1
suppose It is a matter of common noto
riety to every member of the Legislature
who is present in Sacramento that each
one of the candidates has brought, or has
here, a large number of friends who are
working in his behalf. I suppose that
somebody Is paying their expenses. Take
Mr. Bulla's case, for instance. I presume
he probably has more friends here than
any one candidate, and I could well imag
ine that his expenses for keeping those
people here would amount to .a very nice
sum of money. Whether Mr. Bulla Is pay-
Ing it or not I do not know.
Mr. Mellick â I want to ask this ques
tton: In all these legislative districts, or
as to all of them, you refuse to tell what
money has been expended in this way?
A. With but one exception of Dr. La
Baree's case.
Mr. Burnettâ You say you did not keep
a complete memorandum a.s to the money
expended during the campaign?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did you keep any memorandum at
all?
A. Yesi I think I did. I think I kept
some little memorandum.
Mr. Burnettâ Mr. Chairman. I ask that
Mr. Green be required to produce what
ever memoranda he has.
The Chalrma>nâ You were not present,
Mr. Burnett, when that matter was be
fore us. He has already been subpenaed
to do that, and has already explained to
the committee, in your absence, that It
will be necessary for him to go to San
Francisco to procure the memoranda and
he will bring that letter, I suppose. Shall
we, now excuse Mr. Green until he can get
to San Francisco and get that memor
anda?
Mr. Mellickâ Perhaps he can send for
them. We do not want him to go himself
if he can avoid it.
The witnessâ Nobody has access to my
papers down there.
Mr. Mellickâ When do you think you
can get them here?
A. I do not know. I have pressing busi
ness in Sacramento at present.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Green will get them just
as quickly as he can.
Mr. Mellickâ Shall we formulate a state
ment of the refusal of Mr. Green to an
swer questions, or would you prefer that
we should not formulate this report to
the Legislature until you get that mem
orandum? Probably when you get the
memorandum you would be willing to an
swer the question?
A. Why, I can answer anything and
everything that this memorandum would
show right now. The memorandum would
merely show that I received certain
moneys and that I disposed of them.
Mr. Baconâ That would not have any
effect upon his refusing to his answering
those questions that he refused to answer
this morning.
The committee adjourned, to meet at
2:30 p. m.

A. I haven't the faintest idea.
The chairmanâ Have you any questions,

Mr. Mellickâ How much have you re

A. For what?
Q. Toward helping the candidacy of
Mr. Grant?
A. A few hundred dollars.
Q. Tw.o hundred?
A. A few hundred.
Q, A few hundredâ how many hundred?
A. Well, I could not state exactly.
Q. A thousand dollars?
A. I shouldn't say so.
Q. You say it was., not a thousand dol

Q. Do you say not?
A. I don't say I did and I don't say I
didn't. I do not recollect. I wont say
thatâ l would have to have an opportunity
to refresh my memory, and it would de
pend a great deal on what you meant by
the candidacy of Mr. Grant.
Q. Well, toward helping the candidacy.
A. You mean of members of the Legis
lature
Q. No. How much money have you re
ceived from Milton J. Green or from Mr.
Grant? That is it. How much have you
received from Milton Green or Mr. Grant?
Then that question will lead up to an
other. v
A. Maybe you should lead up to the
other.
Q. No. You answer that and then the
other.
A. How much have I received? Does
that Imply expended?
Q. No.
A. I should not say it was over a thou
sand dollars.
Q. Do you say it was not over a thou
sand dollars?
A. It is my present opinion it wasn't.
Q. About a thousand dollars?
A. Yes. I don't believe it was that.
Q. How did you expend that money that
you receivedâ how did you expend it?
A. Oh â oh, hotels and traveling ex
penses, very likely.
Q. And newspaper support, I suppose?
A. My newspaper.
Q. Yesâ the Wave.
A. No, sir.
Q. Of course it does not have any refer
ence to this case as far as I can see about
whether the Wave got paid or not, but I
want to find out where this money went.
Now, then, did any of it go toward the
support of the Waveâ oi this $1000.
A. Not a penny.
Q. But It went toward your expenses
and hotel billsâ traveling expenses.
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And what else?
A. That is all.
Q. Hotel bills and traveling expenses.
Now. where were your traveling ex
penses?
. A. Oh, I made one trip East and a trip
down to Los Angeles two or three times.
Q. How far east?
A. As far as New York.
O. How much did it cost that trip?
A. Really, I never kept any account
of it.
Q. You think $1000 the limit?
A. I think it covered it; yes, sir.
Q. Where else did you travel, you say,
over the State?
A. Down to Los Angeles.
Q. Who did you see in Los Angeles
anybody? That is, a member of the Leg
islature?
A. Any member that was elected this
time?
Q. Any member of the Legislature did
you see in Los AngeleÃV
A. No; I do not remember of seeing any
except Bulla.
Q. Did you not give Mr. Bulla any
money?
A. No, sir; I did not give any legislator
any money for any purpose.
Q. Now, then, were you present when
Mr. Green spent some money, or did you
spend money yourself toward keeping a
Democratic candidate in the field In any
legislative district?
A. Was I present when Mr. Green spent
some money?
Q. Yes.
A. No. Or did I spend any money my
self?
Q. Yes.
A. No, sir.
Q. Then, how do you know that there
was money spent by Mr. Green for keep-
Ing a certain legislative candidate in the
field?
A. Have you established the fact that I
do know it?
Q. I have not. I simply wanted to ask
you.
A. You haven't established the fact yet
that I do know It?
Q. Well, do you know it?
A. Well, I think it might have been so
yes, sir.
y. Well, tell the circumstances.
A. Well, as I don't know the circum
stances It would be difficult for me to tell
them.
Q. Tell them as far ns you know.
A. Well, 1 don't know anything that I
haven't done myself or seen done, and I
haven't either done it or seen It done.
Q. What were the circumstances as you
heard them? You were one of the man
agers?
A. I doubt if I am entitled to tell.
Really I think there was a case where
there was a Democrat kept in and that
the purpose was to elect a Republican
Legislature and to get an honest man. We
wanted friends, good, nonest men in the
Legislature.
Q. Go on and tell the circumstances as
you heard them about that case.
A. I don't think I can relate It just as
1 heard it.
Q. Well, as near as you can.
A. Well, I think there was a candidate
somewhere. I do not know just where. I
can recall that there was a Democrat who
ought to be kept in the fight, and he was
kept in it.
Q. Where was the place as near as you
can remember it?
A. I cannot tell where It was.
Q. Well, it seems to me you ought to
jog your memory a little bit?
A. I did not expect to be called this
afternoon. I only got served with a sub
pena this afternoon.
Q. What I am getting at, Mr. Brown, is
this: If some Republican here is under
obligations to you for keeping a Demo
cratic opponent in the field we want to
find out who that legislator is.
A. I think it is my party he would be
under obligations to. I did not do it. you
know. Under any obligation to me? There
is no legislator under any obligations to
me.
Q. Oh, no, I do not suppose so. I do
not suppose you spent your own money.
A. Oh.Â«io.
Q. Well, was that Democratic candidate
north of here?
A. I cannot recall.
Q. Now, then, you know a case, do you
not, where a Populist candidate was kept
in the field in order to split up the oppo
sition vote, do you not?
A. No, I do not know that.
Q. Don't you remember telling me that,
Mr. Brown, as a matter of fact three
weeks ago next Saturday?
A. Down at Mr. Green's office?.
Q. Yes. Don't you remember telling me
that, now?
A. No. 1 do not. I might have said some
thing to you about it. but I really do not
know of any of the facts.
Q. Don't you think you talked as though
you knew the facts that day, when you
thought I was some greenie from the
country?
A. No, I did not think you were a
greenie, becatise I had known of you be
fore. 1 had known of you during the Per
kins campaign. I was quite familiar with
that campaign.
Q. Do you not remember telling me
those facts, Mr. Brown?
A. I was talking to you at quite great
length. 1 remember telling you that I
thought any one who thought Mr. Bulla
could be elected Senator was a tit candi
date for the Home for the Feeble-Minded.
Q. Now. then, you remember that; why
cannot you remember the other fact?
A. Because it seemed to anger you
somewhat. That is what impressed it
upon me. I told you generally that we
tried to help any candidate, or we de
sired to try to help aay candidate that
stood in need of assistance.
Q. What other candidates have been
helped by you?
A. I haven't helped any.
Q. You say you have helped where they
needed any assistance?
A. I was not taken in confidence to that
extent. I was simply general adviser.
Q. As general adviser what was your
sphere?
A. Oh. my advice would be to help any
body who needed help so as to insure a
Republican Legislature.
Q. Now, then, who was one of those that
you advised should be helped?
A. I cannot recall specifically. But if
your name would come up I would advise
that you be helped.
Q. Did you advise that I should be
helped?
A. I do not know that your name ever
came up.
Q. Did it never come up? .
A. I never discussed names. We just
discussed the principles of the thing.
Q. What principles?
A. The Republican candidates. It was
perfectly honest to do so. Nothing repre
hensible about It. It is done all over the
Union.
Q. Name one of the cases.
A. One of what cases?
Q. Where you helpedâ where you ad
vised.
A. I did not help,
Q. Where you advised to help.
A. I tell you 1 don't advise as to any
specific case.
Q. You say, then, you were simply
called in and you said. "We ought to
have anybody that Is worthy"?
A. Oh, that was long bifore the cam
paign that the course of the procedure
was determined on.
Q. What did you do. then, all this other
time? You were giving advice early
in the season. What have you been do
ing since?
A. Giving advice since.
Q. The same old advice right over and
over, I suppose?
A. Oh. no; I modified it occasionally.
Q. Never had a specific plan, though?
A. For an individualâ no, sir.
Q. Never?
A. No, sir; Ido not think so. Do you
consider it a man's duty to write to a
candidate for the United States Senate
and say that he wants to support him,
and who afterward takes assistance from
him to be elected to the Senate or As
semblyâdo you consider that man dis
honest, or the transaction dishonest?
Q. I did not quite get the question.
A. Do you consider a candidate for the
Assembly who writes to a candidate for
the United States Senate, stating that
he favors his candidacy for the United
States Senate and who afterward ;ueept3
assistance one way or the Ot~er â do you
consider a man dishonest because he doea
that?
Q. What do you think about it?
A. Oh, I do not think that is dishonest.
Q. We will say what we think about it
in our report.
A. I just wanted your personal view
of it.
Q. Now, then, what would you think
about it if that man should not vote for
that candidate, after you had contributed
to his campaign, and he does not vote for
your candluate. after your having con
tributed that, what would you think of
that then?
A. If there has been some kind of a re
arrangement?
Q. When he has written to the Senator
ial candidate, asked for money and has
got the money and in that same letter
having said he was for him for United
States Senatorâ and has got the mo -
ey; then after having got the money in
the campaign, he goes up to ilv Legisla
ture and votes against that Senatorial
candidateâ what should you think of him?
A. Well, unless something happened to
change his view I would think he was a
liar.
Q. Would you think ho was dishonest?
A. In a sense, yes. Something might
happen that would change a man's views;
I can imagine that.
Q. Now, then, having got that money,
he is dishonest if he does not vote for
that candidate?
A. No, that isn't it. He was dishonest
when he made the statement in the let
ter. He lied when he marie the state
ment in the letter.
Q. Have you seen any letters from any
candidates?
A. No, sir.
Q. In which they said they were for
17. S. Grant Jr. for the United States
Senate?
A. No, sir.
Q. And then have got money?
A. No, sir.
Q. Have you ever seen any letters of
that kind?
A. From whom?
Q. From anybody.
A. Yes.
Q. Who were they?
A. It wasn't in this campaign. It was
in the Perkins campaign.
Q. I am speaking of U. S. Grant Jr.
A. I was speaking of the Perkins cam
paign.
Q. We are not investigating thatâ but in
this campaign?
A. No, sir; I have not.
Q. Did you see any letters' from any
body saying that a certain legislative
candidate was for Mr. Grant for United
States Senator?
A. No. sir. I was out of the State for
sixty days, you know, during the time the
campaign was really on and during the
election. Probably that accounts for my
ignorance.
The chairmanâ Mr. Brown, you have
been personally very much interested in
the candidacy of Mr. Grant, have you
not? Â»
A. Yes, because I thought he was an
AD VERTISEMEN TS.
Thousands of men in lonely homes call
up the pictures of the loved and lost ones,
who might still be happy husbands with
healthy babies prattling at their knees, if
they had only been a little more observant
and thoughtful. When a woman's com-
plexion gets pale and sallow and her eyes
look heavy; when she is evidently nervous
and despondent, and complains of pains
and aches and dragging down and burning
sensations; a wise man should know that
she is suffering from weakness or disease in
a womanly way. The thoughtful man who
realizes this will at once advise his wife to
consult some eminent and skillful special-
ist. He will know that the average physi-
cian will insist upon the obnoxious exam-
inations and local treatment so embarrass-
ing to modest, sensitive women. He should
know that these ordeals are unnecessary.
Dr. R. V. Pierce is an eminent and skillful
specialist, who has been for thirty years
chief consulting physician to the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buffalo,
N. Y. During that time, with the assist-
ance of a staff of able physicians, he has
prescribed for many thousands of wom-
en. He is the inventor of a wonderful
medicine for the special weaknesses of
women, that cures in the privacy of the
home. It is known as Dr. Pierce s Favorite
Prescription. It makes the delicate and
important organs that bear the burdens of
maternity strong, healthy and vigorous. It
corrects all irregularities and stops all de-
bilitating drains. Medicine dealers sell it
and have nothing "just as good."
W. R. Malcolm. Esq.. of Knobel, Clay Co.,
Ark., writes: "My wife for perhaps four months
previous to the birth of our child took the ' Fa-
vorite Prescription.' This strengthened her en-
tire system, and child-birth, to her, was very
easy, being attended with little pain. Our baby
Ruth is 13 mouths old and she has never been
a day." \ l_

THE COMPLETE EVIDENCE OF MONEY OFFERED AND GIVEN.
i
honest man. I took an Interest in his i
campaign.
Q. Mr. Gnint has had the hearty sup
port of your paper, has he not?
A. Oh, yes. indeed.
Q. From the beginning of the time when
he first began to have Senatorial aspira- ;
tions?
A. No. 1 don't believe the paper men
tioned Mr. Grant-
Q. So far as you know.
A. Or said a kindly word of him until j
afterâ l don't think it did, until after the
gubernatorial light in the State conven
tion. 1 don't believe it said a kind word
of him â don't believe we said anything j
of hi::,.
Q. Well. Mr. Brown, were you not
actively the advocate of Grant for the |
United States Senate a long time before
the State convention at which the pres
ent Governor was nominated?
A. Yes.
Q. You took part in the fight with ref
erence to gaining a United States Senator ;
from the south, did you not?
A, Yes. sir.
Q. And for that purpose wrote numer
ous editorials which were printed in the i
Wave ?
A. Advocating that measure?
Q. Advocating the measure of defeat
ing a southern candidate for Governor,
did you not?
A. Well, of course, naturally the Gov
ernorâ southern candidate for Gover- i
nor would heâ
Q. The object and aim of your paper
was to [eat the nomination of a south
ern man for Governor, in order that it
might not stand in the way of the se
lection of a southern man for Senator. Is
that not true?
A. In respon.se to the general expres
sion of opinion of the south, we took
about that view of It.
Q. And in that matter what you wrote I
and what you said and what you did was
In the interest of U. S. Grant Jr. as you*,
choice for Senator from the south?
A. Not bo much as harmony in the Re
publican party.
Q. Was it at all so?
A. In the Interest of Grant?
Q. Yes.
A. It was in the interest of a Senator
from the south, whoever he might be.
Q. Well, at that time was not Mr. Grant
personally your choice?
A. Well, wo published a very nice pic
ture of Mr. Gage 'id did not charge
him anything, when he was candidate
for Senator, and also Mr. Bulla and Mr.
Grant.
Q. Was not at that time Mr. Grant
your personal choice?
A. l would rather have seen him win
and would still.
Q. And it was understood between you
and Mr. Grant that you would advocate
the interests of Mr. Grant from the be
ginning of his campaign for Senator, was
it not?
A. Through the press?
Q. Through th( Wave?
A. Oh. no; we never had any under
standing about that. I don't own the
Wave.
Â«..'. Hut you are editorial writer for the
Wave?
Mr. Mellickâ Who owns the Wave?
A. I do a portion. I am part owner.
Mr. Cosgrave is the other.
Q. You are part owner?
A. I cannot dictate its policy.
Q. You have a voice in its policy?
A. Vis. but I could not consult with Mr.
Grant and dictate the policy.
Q. Well, had you any consultation with
Mr. Grant and your co-owner as to the
policy of the Wave with reference to Mr.
Grant's candidacy?
A. No. 1 took this method. Mr. Chair
man. 1 wrote to every newspaper south
Of iTehachapi and asked them what was
the sentimant of the people in their com
munity.- 1 think I wrote 120 letters, and
out of those letters 1 got replies to more
than a maiority of them saying that they
wanted a Senator, and they wanted noth
ing else, and 1 laid those letters before
my partner. On that basis we proceeded
to tight for a Senator from the south.
Q. Now, in that matter Mr. Grant paid
you for your services, did he not?
A. No. "sir. he did not. I ha-'e never
received a dollar of money from Mr. Grant
for my services, nor has Mr. Green.
Not a fraction of a cent.
â¢ Q. At whose suggestion did you become
the general adviser of Mr. Grant with ref
erence to his Senatorial aspirations?
A. Will my answer to this tend to 1 con
vict anybody of using money to secure
the election of a United States Senator?
Q. Not to my knowledge.
A. Well. 1 do not think scarcely, Mr.
Chairman, that is pertinent.
Q. Well, you will have to permit the
commiti to bo the judges of that ques
tion. If you refuse to answerâ
A. Well, Mr. Green wanted me to go
into the fight.
Q. What was said to you by Mr. Green
with reference to taking an advisory part
in the campaign?
A. Oh. we went over a list of men in
the south. We picked on Grant.
Q. What I mean by my question is this:
To define aa nearly as possible your re
lations as adviser to Grant's campaign.
Now. was Mr. Grant to submit to your
Judgment and that of Mr. Green as to how
his candidacy should be conducted?
A. Very largely, except that they were
to be confined to honest lines, of co.urse â
[mate methods and purposes.
Q. Yes. Was anything said between you
as to what constituted legitimate pur
poses?
A. Why. no. It is pretty apparent what !
would be Illegitimate. . â 
Q. You think you understand that prop
osition.
A. I think I have an idea.
Q_. Well, Mr. Brown, have you kept close
track on the candidacy of Mr. Grant
with reference to the chances he would
have if certain men throughout the State
were elected to the Legislature.
A. I kept pretty closeâ well, I figured
this way, that most of the men who
would come to the Legislature were un
trammeled. I considered that most of the
men who came to the Legislature and
were un trammeled would eventually vote
for Mr. Grant. Of course, we always fig
ured that we had Mi. Burns to oppose us.
That was the idea. Over a year ago I
thought Mr.- Burns would be a candidate
for the Senate. We always figured that
we would have him in opposition to us.
Our chief concern was who would not
vote for him.
Q. Well, now, Mr. Brown, I will ask the
reporter to read to you the question, and
1 think you will see that your answer is
not responsive.
A You asked me if I i had kept close
track.
Q. Yes.
A. I will say reasonably close.
Q. You knew who were nominated in the
several districts of the State for the Leg
islature, pretty good general knowledge,
had you not?
A. Well, you know I was absent from
the State sixty days during the campaign.
Q. i am only speaking of such people as
you know?
A. You mean did I know them person
ally?
THE EVENING SESSION.
The committee met at 7:30 p. m. in
room II of the Capitol. The following
proceedings were had: Alden Ander-
Eon, being duly sworn, testified as fol
lows:
Mr. Mellickâ Mr. Anderson, did you re
ceive any financial assistance from any
one in any shape or manner to aid you in
your canvass or election, to the Assembly?
"I lid not."
"Did you receive any offer of assist
ance?"
"I did."
"From whom?"
"Directly from Milton J. Green."
"Relate the circumstances."
"Do you want the details?"
"Yrs."
"I should judge about five weeks before
the election an acquaintance of mine, I
whom 1 understand is an acquaintance of j
Mr. Green, came to me in my private of
â¢ fice at SuiHUn, and after talking over mat
ters, said that in was Instructed by Mil
ton J. Green to tell me that If I needed
any assistance in my campaign he v. . -
prepared to furnish it, and said that Mr.
Green was working in the interests of
U. B. Grant, who was a candidate for
Unit( States Senator, and mentioned the
sum if throe to five hundred dollars that
would be available if I wished it. I im
mediately told the man that he ought to
have known me well enough to have told
Mr Green that I did not wish, nor would
I receive, any such assistance from him
or from anybody else. This man said that
that was what he had informed Mr.
Green. I thought nothing more of the
matter, hut my business required me to
be in San Francisco about once a week
durinr? the fall months. It seems to me
it was about a week later when 1 was in
Ban Francisco I stopped at the Grand Ho
tel. On my return to the hotel, as near as
I remember it.. i found a card from Mr.
Green saying that he .would ilke very
much to see me on a matter of Import
n-r.cc. and, having a little time at my dis
posal, I went up to Mr. Green's office,
which is in tho Crocker building-, directly
opposite the Grand Hotel. I went into the
office and Mr. Crant wna in there."
Q. Mr. Grant?
A. Ana Mr. Greenâ and I forget;
there were some other gentlemen
there, but after a little casual talk .
Mr. Green called me into his other
office, and, after a little talk, he
wanted to know how I stood on the
Senatorial question. I told him that
my constituents, as yet, had no de
cided preference. He said, "You are
very friendly toward Mr. Perkins.''
I told him my people up there felt
very kindly toward Mr. Perkins. And
he tried to persuade me that it was
Mr. Perkins' wish that Mr. Grant be
elected United States Senator from
Southern California, and he attempt
ed to show me some letters, but I
paid no attention to him, and he went
on and said he was lending some as
sistance to candidates and would like
to assist me in my canvass. I told
Mr. Green, as near as I can remem
ber, or words to this effect, that he
probably did not know me very well,
but it was no use to make that kind
of a proposition to me; that when I
could not go to Sacramento as a free
moral agent to act as I thought right
and just for the best interests of the
people that I went there to represent,
I would not go at all; I was willing
to be defeated. And with that I
started to leave the room, but in the
meantime Mr. Green had been fum
bling at a drawer or something, and
he stepped around in front of me and
said, "You had better take this any
how." He had a handful of $20 gold
pieces, but I walked past him and
went out, and from that day to this
I have had no further conversation
with him. But I immediately, when
I got on the street, expressed myself
to a friend of mine that never in any
shape or manner would I vote, if my
vote was to be the deciding vote, for
Mr. Grant or for any other candidate
who used those methods to become
elected United States Senator.
Q. What is this man's name that came
to see yon down in Suisun about five
weeks before election?
A. Raymond Benjamin of Vallejo. I be
lieve he is in Sacramento at present. I
have not seen him.
Q. Since you came to Sacramento have
you been approached in the interest of
any candidate with improper influences?
A. I have nut in any way, shape or
manner.
Q. Is there anj - thing else you want to
Bay, Mr. Anderson?
A. If th^re is any question you can sug
gest. I do not know of anything- by
which 1 could make myself clearer. If
Mr. Benjamin is in town I would be
â¢i to have you subpena him and
have him tell or make his statement.
<J. Let us see. was not there some story
an offer of patronage? Have you
received any offer?
A. Never, in any way. shape or manner.
Q. Did that agent in Suisun intimate
that if you received that money it would
be a part of the expectation that you
should vote for Mr. Grant?
A. Well, 1 cannot remember that that
consideration was expressly stipulated,
hut that was my understanding of it.
Q. And how about when Mr. Green
spoke to you?
A. Well, that is as I sayâ l cannot say
that it was expressly stipulated, but that
is my understanding. I know that I felt
rather Indignant. I thought that mv rep
utation was such as to preclude any such
oftVr being made to me. It made mo reel
that I did not care to remember anything
about it.
M \ Burnettâ There was no one else in
the room with you when Mr. Green made
this offer?
A. No. sir.
Mr. Lardnerâ Mr. Anderson, if you could
by any means have been tempted to ac
cept the money would you have felt that
you would have been in duty bound to
support Grant?
A. Morally. I would have been bound
to have supported Grant; yes.
Q. You felt that the condescension went
far enough if you could have been tempt
ed to accept the money you would have
been bound to have supported Mr. Grant?
A. That was my understanding, yes.
Mr. Sanfordâ WhÂ«n you visited Mr.
Green's office did you say that Mr. Grant
was there also?
"Well, he was in the first office when I
went in, but Mr. Grant never spoke to
me about supporting him or any one else."
"He did not mention the. matter him
self?"
"Not at all."
The- chairmanâ Mr. Anderson, at the
time that Mr. Benjamin was at your of
fice in Suisun, did you say?
" Y< s. sir."
That incident occurred before your
meeting with Mr. Green in Mr. Green's
uffiee?
Yes. I would say probably a -week be
fore.
And what time was that with relation
to the nomination In your Assembly dis
trict?
As near as I can remember it was after
the nominations. I know as near as 1
can remember it was about a month be
fore the election.
The candidacy, then, for the Assembly
on your part was in progress?
Yes, sir.
Was the question of Mr. Grant's candi
dacy discussed by Mr. Benjamin to you
and -with you prior to any offer of as
sistance to you?
Well, It .ill came in the conversation
But I would say here that Mr. Benjamin
not actinf: as an agon:. He was
merely, T might say. as a mutual ac
quaintance.
<>t yours?
of Mr. Green. I am not much acquaint
ed with Mr. Green. Only met him casual
ly. I did not know the gentleman much.
You do not now remember whether any
statement waa made that Mr. Grant
would be a candidate for I'nited States
Senator prior to the offer of assistance
in your campaign?
Who by, do you mean?
Mr. Benjamin. '
A. Well, this all took place at one con
versation.
Q. I know at the one conversation but
now. then, it seems to me to be important
to know whether the question of Mr
Grant's candidacy had been discussed at
all between you before any suggestion
was made that you might rec< Ive finan
cial assistance.
A. Oh, it was all covered. This financial
assistance was a part of his candidacy as
I understood it.
Q. You don't remember now as to the
order of events in that particular?
A. Order of eventsâ how do you mean?
Q. Simply this: As to whether the ques
tion of Mr. Grant being a candidate tra&
discussed by you with Mi. Benjamin be
fore h<> suggested that you might ge\
financial assistance?
A. We]], it waa all in the sameâ you
might say in the same breath. Jt was
part of th< conversation. He said that
Mr. Green was his manager â Grant's
managerâ and he was the one that was
â willing to do the assisting.
Mr. MellUkâ How much gold do you
think you saw?
A. I don't know. Probably about ?500
The chairmanâ Now, did Mr. Beniamin
say anything at that interview as to" what
authority he had to speak for Mr. Gran: ?
A. Well, he represented that he wasâ
he spoke by Mr. Green's authority, but
that he did so more at the request of
Mr. Green than from any feeling or in
terest he had in the matter. As he ex
pressed it to me. ho told Mr. Green it
wasn't any use of seeing me, as 1 re
in' mber it.
Q. Did he say anything to the effect
thai Mr. Green had sent him to you?
A. Yes, sir.
Q, STes; that :s what I wanted.
A. V. -
Q. Then he spoke directly as one who
had come from Green to you at Green's
suggestion? And at this interview later
in Mr. Green's office was anything said
by Mr. Gtnen or yourself as to tho fact I
that Mr. Benjamin had seen you and
â â¢â¢'I with you on that proposition?
A. I really dp not remember. Ido not
remember.
Q. You do not remember that the inci
dent occurring in the Suisun office was
mentioned in the conversation in Mr.
Green's office?
A. No.
THE SAN FKAK CISCO CALL, THUKSBAY, JAKUAEY 19, 1899.
Q. Now, when you saw Mr. Green and
Mr. Grant together at Mr. Green's office,
was Mr. Grant in the office at the time
Mr. Green requested you to step into the
other room?
A. He was in the front office.
Q. And after you got into this other
room you and Mr. Green were alone?
A. Yes.
Q. What was the first suggestion made
to you at that time? That Mr. Grant
would be a candidate or that Mr. Green
was in a position to assist you if you
wanted assistance in your race?
A. Oh, I think he tried to convince me
first that it was Senator Perkins' wish
that Mr. Grant be a candidate and be
elected.
Q. That was before any offer of assist
ance?
A. Yes, sir.
cj. At that time in Mr. Green's office
was any sum named that he would assist
you with?
A. Well, no, not exactly.
Q. Was the difficulty of your candidacy
expressed?
A. By me?
Q. Or by him.
A. Oh, I never considered that I had a
very hard fight. I do not remember;
might have been something said casually.
Q. What has been the condition of the
votes of your Assembly district?
A. Oh, under normal conditions I think
it Is Republican.
Q. You had not at that time any fears
of defeat?
A. No, sir.
Q. Did you so express yourself to Mr.
Green?
A. Yes.
Q. At that time?
A. I expressed it to everybody.
And before the offer of assistance do
you know?
Yes.
And he still insisted on assisting you,
did he?
Offered me the money; I do not know
what you would call it.
Now, then, how much did he offer you
as nearly as you can determine it.
Oh, I should say from three to five hun
dred dollars was in his hand.
In gold twenties?
Yes.
Mr. Anderson, in the conversation with
Mr. Benjamin, or in the conversation with
Mr. Green, was any statement made to
you to the effect that Mr. Green was do
ing this as a common matter or doing it
for any candidate?
I remember of him saying that It was
his intense desire to elect a Republican;
that it was Mr. Grant's intense desire to
elect a Republican Legislature that
prompted him to do this for me.
Did he say to you that he was assist
ing any other candidates to the Assem
bly or the Senate?
Not to the best of my recollection at
present.
Do you know of any other persons who
have been approached In like manner as
you were approached?
No, sir.
Have you been approached in any mere
tricious manner by any other candidate
or his agentâ l am now speaking of a can
didate for United States Senator, since
your nomination?
No, sir.
Or prior thereto?
No, sir.
Can you point this committee to any
evidence on any line through which they
can obtain any evidence of any meretri
cious action on the part of any canuidate
for United States Senator?
No, sir.
Other than that you have named?
No, sir.
At the timf>. of this conversation in Mr.
Green's office did Mr. Green say to you
that this was with the knowledge and
consent of Mr. Grant, or anything to that
effect ?
That he approached me Individually?
Q. Yes.
A. Xo; I rather got a sense of feeling
that he was doing it all around in orderâ
the impression that he wanted to give to
me by his words, not by his actions, was
that it was his intense desire to elect the
whole Republican Legislature and he was
afraid if he did not help them why they
I not be elected.
Q. Did he tell you whose money he was
offering you?
A. Well, 1 did not give him time after
he offered me the money.
Q. Did you know whose money he was
offering you?
A. My understanding was that it was
Mr. Grant's money.
Q. You might state to the committee
how you obtained that understanding.
A. Oh, I have been telling you the ar
gument that he went Into to prove that
he was interested in Mr. Grant's candi
dacy, and that Mr. Grant was a cano.date
and" that he would do all in his power to
elect a Republican Legislature.
Q. Has any candidate now before the
Legislature of this State for the United
States Senate offered you any inducement
directly or indirectly other than that you
have named, personally or through his
ag< nt, to vote for him?
A. No. sir.
Q. That Includes, also, the matter of
any patronage that might be offered youâ
you understand it that way?
A. Yes, sir. No way, shape or manner.
Q. Can you point this committee to any
evidence, direct or indirect, where any
candidate for the United States Senate,
now seeking the votes of this Legislature
has used the matter of patronage as an
Inducement?
A. No. sir.
The chairmanâ Has any of the commlt
tee any desire to ask any further ques
tions? That is all, Mr. Anderson.

going to the city with him, and I met

nsked me to step around the corner and
shake hands with Mr. Grant and intro
duced me to him at that time, arid told
me shortly afterward that he was a can
didate for United ' States Senator, and
that Senator Perkins had requested him

Q. Did Mr. Green at any time offer to
assist you in your candidacy for the As

A. Yes, sir.
Q. Financially?
A. Yes.
Q. You may state to the committee the
time and occasion and the persons pres
ent.
A. In September, some time preceding
the primaries in Alameda County, I was
engaged in advancing my candidacy. On
account of the intense bitterness accom
panying the candidacy of several of the
local county officers the district, which
ordinarily would be in my favor, was in
danger, and I saw that In order to elect
delegates that would be favorable to mÂ»
I should have to make a strong fight in
the district. Frank C. Jordan was the
candidate for County Clerk. He came
from the Seventh Ward, and It was
against him that the intense bitter feel
ing was directed, and in order to succeed
I had to combine with him to win out
the delegation in the Seventh Ward. The
talk In regard to his candidacy and the
danger in regard to mine was well known
and was very well known to my friend,
Mr. Green, who lives in Oakland, and
was watching the campaign with a good
deal of interest. The question as to what
procedure to take was often discussed by
all of us who were interested in the out
come, and it was determined that in or
der to win the delegation at all a great
deal of hard work and the expenditure
of money would have to be had. One
morning In crossing on the boat I met
Mr. Green.
Q. This was in September, I understand?
A. Yes, sir; before the primaries. And,
as waa usual at our meetings, we dis
cussed politics, and he said: "Howard,
I sco that you are going to have a des
perate fight over there." I said: "les,
Milt; it Is in a pretty hard position. I
don't know whether we are going to win
out or not," because the Leckey ticket in
the Seventh Ward was opposed to ours
and they were very strong. "Well, ' he
said, "in case you need any assistance at
all to carry your Seventh Ward delega
tion why let me know and I will help
you." "Well," I said, "Milt, we are inti
mate friends, but what does that involve?
Does it involve the Senatorial question in
case of my election?" "Why," he said,
"not a particle." He said: "I am interest
ed very largely in the success of the Re
publican ticketâ the Republican Legisla
tive ticketâ and you and I are strong per
sonal friends. I am Interested doubly in
you, in that I want to see you In the first
place elected; in the second place I want
to see a Republican Legislature elected."
"Well," I said, "I don't Know whether I
could accept that assistance without com
promising myself." "Well," he said, "put
it on the extreme personal grounds be
tween you and me. Rob it of the Sena
torial situation altogether and leave it
there." "Well," I said. "I will think about
it." Three or four days later I saw him
and told him that I had thought it over
and that with the express agreement and
condition between us that it would not af
fect my vote in the Senatorial matter, if
he as my friend wished to help me out in
that campaign over there I would accept
his assistance, and I did and expended the
money throughout the district and ac
complished the success of our delegation
by winning tho Seventh Ward by thÂ«i nar
row margin of six votes.
Q. Now, to what amount were you so
assisted?
A. Nino hundred dollars.
Q. And how was that obtained?
A. That was obtained from Mr. Green.
Q. In cash or by check?
A. In cash.
Q. And all at once?
A. No, sir; $500 at one time and $400 at
another time. â¢
Q. Was that money expended in your
race subsequent or prior to the primaries?
A. Prior.
Q. In what manner was. it expended?
A. It was expended in hiring workers.
We had an army of them over in the
Seventh Ward and carriages and adver
tising and the rest of it.
Q. Bands?
A. Bands and bonfires and everything
of that sort. And also in Berkeley there
was a split delegation in Temescal, where
we had to do a great deal of hard work.
The situation was pretty well split up.
Q. Was any of that money expendedâ
any of the. $900â after the primary?
A. Not a dollar.
Q. Did you at any time thereafter re
ceive any assistance from Mr. Grant
through Mr. Green or otherwise in your
political aspirations?
A. No sir; In no way whatever.
Q. Did you know at the time that you
received this money from Mr. Green to
whom it belonged?
A. No, sir; I did not.
Q. Did you know at that time that Mr.
Green was the financial agent and mana
ger of Mr. Grant's candidacy?
A. I did not know that the relationship
existed in that particular until long after
ward, when he himself told me of his re
lationship.
Q. In these talks preliminary- to the
offering of assistance and at the time the
assistance was offered you. did Mr. Green
Bay anything to you to the effect that he
would probably or would be the manager
of Mr. Grant in his Senatorial race?
A. No, sir, not at any timeâ well, at
my first conversation he said he was in
terested, through Mr. Perkins, in Mr.
Grant's campaign, but In what capacity
he did not state, and was going to help
Q. Did he say in what manner he would
help him?
A. No, sir.
Q. You knew at that time that Mr.
Green had been something of a manager
of Mr. Perkins" fight prior to this?
A Yes, sir. 1 had been through one
campaign with him in Mr. Perkins' fight
and I had known that Mr. Perkins four
years ago had all over the State of Cali
fornia assisted in this same manner legis
lative candidates; that not only had he
done so. but I knew that six years ago
he and Mr. Felton in my district and the
other Senatorial and Assembly districts
had expended $1500 apiece for the purpose
of electing a Legislature that would be
Republican. . , â
Q At the time that you asked Mr.
Green what the matter involved if you
were to accept assistance, was not that
question prompted by your knowledge
that such had been the manner of dis
tributing money in the Perkins fight?
A Yes. sir.
Q. And with the suspicion that Mr.
Green was offering you Grant money?
A. Yes, sir.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Chairman, on behalf of
Mr. Green I desire to object to so pal
pably a leading and suggestive question
as that, and I desire to leave it to the
sense of fairness that must be present In
the breast of every American citizen to
bear me out in asserting that it is wrong
to put words in the witness' mouth in
that manner. I am sorry to have to rise
and make that objection, but my sense of
duty to Mr. Grant, my sense of duty to
these gentlemen who are sitting here will
not allow me to sit still and see the chair
man of this investigating committee put
the words In the mouth of the Speaker of
the Assembly of the State of California,
The witnessâ l would say, Mr. Chair
man, and Mr. Bacon, that the question
to mo did not appear to be leading or re
flecting In the slightest degree on Mr.
Grant, because I will explain to this com
mittee my conviction that Mr. Grant has
not been engaged in the corrupt use of
money to influence legislators. That is
my feeling and I shall give expression to
It before my testimony Is over.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Chairman, I desire to
apologize if I have said anything that was
unseemly, but it seemed to me that that
was wrong for the chairman to put that
question as he did. If I did wrong in mak
ing that suggestion I desire to apologize.
The chairmanâ l think it is very proba
ble, Mr. Bacon, that you and myself
would very materially disagree as to my
prerogative in the matter of putting these
questions. I do not understand that tnis
committee sits as a court. 1 do not un
derstand that wo sit hero, in presenting
the case In chief, as a court, and must
therefore be bound by the ordinary rules
of evidence; nor do I understand that a
question that is distinctively a leading
question in court can be objected to be
cause It is leading in this kind of an in
vestigation. I may be wrong, gentlemen,
but I think I am right in the proposition
that a question that will get at the facts
the closest, quickest and most pungently is
a proper question. You will take cogni
zance, Mr. Bacon, of the fact that x.ir.
Wright stands in a somewhat different re
lation to this committee than almost any
other witness would, for Hie reason that
this committee is here at his suggestion,
because of charges made against him, and
his conclusions upon the matter would be
more pertinent, perhaps, than that of an-
other witness.
Mr. Baconâ That is just the reason why
his conclusions should not be asked for
by suggestive questions. He is on trial
here just the same as anybody else, and
if this gentleman can come in here and
have his words put in his mouth and give
conclusions it is a farce to try him. If
there ever was a reason why a leading
or suggestive question or a question call-
Ing for a conclusion of the witness should
not be put to that witness that case ex
ists to-day and right now. I move, Mr.
Chairman, that the question and answer
be stricken out on the ground that it is
leading and suggestive and calls for the
conclusion of the witness, and I desire to
say that I want my right to have that
stricken out reserved, because I did not
conceive that the question would be an
swered. It tbok me some time to make
up my mind that the question had been
nsked, and before I could make my ob
jection the question had been answered.
Tho witnessâ Mr. Bacon, perhaps it
might be in order to have the question
read.
Mr. Bacon â I don't care to hear It read.
Mr. Wright. I move to strike It out and
the committee can take it under advise
ment or act upon it now and we can
proceed with the investigation. Ido not
desire to take up any time.
The chairmanâ You do this on behalf of
Mr. Green?
Mr. Bacon â I do, most certainly.
The chairmanâ Gentlemen of the com
mittee, Mr. Bacon has moved that the
last question and answer be stricken out.
What is your pleasure?
Mr. Lardnerâ l move you that the ob
jection be received, and that the strlk
ing of it out be left for further considera
tion of the committee.
Seconded and carried.
The chairmanâ At the time you expend
ed this $000 in your fight you knew that
the money was Grant's money, did you?
A. No, sir.
O. You did not?
A. No, sir.
Q. Do you now know that It was Mr.
Grant's money?
A. I have learned so since this investi
gation.
Q. By what means did you learn It?
A. By the testimony of Mr. Green.
Q. That was your first knowledge?
A. Yes, sir.
Mr. Baconâ Now. Mr. Chairman, do you
desire me to make an objection to every
leading question that you ask?
The chairmanâ l do not desire to direct
your light, Mr. Bacon.
Mr. Baconâ l want you gentlemen to
understand me. that I do not want to sit
here and make needless or trivial nor
time-wasting objections; but I have sat
here all day to-day and all yesterday and
last night to hear the trial of a case in
which Mr. Wright has been charged in
the public prints with taking money un
lawfully to influf nee his vote on the ques
tion of United States Senator for Cali
fornia, and to-night the same tactics are
being pursued. Mr. Wright is not being
examined here at all. This examination
Is proceeding on the theory or with the
evident purpose of somebody not to try
Mr. Wright, but. over his shoulder, in
jure the candidacy of some gentleman for
the United States Senate. Why don't
you get down to the facts and ask Mr.
Wright these questions?
The chairmanâ Mr. Bacon, if you have
any suspicions of that sort you will kind
ly keep them to yourself until you make
your final argument nere, because the
committee cannot be intimidated by such
insinuations. We are here to try this
case and we propose to do it as we think
proper. I hope j - ou understand that.
Mr. Baconâ Mr. Chairman, there is no
body on earth has any higher regard for
the untrammeled action of a committee
or a court than I have. I have not at
tempted to intimidate anybody. I have
sat here and listened to this thing and
have hardly raised my voice during the
entire proceedings; but I objected to a
leading question a minute ago and an
other ono follows it almost immediatelyâ
three follow it and I didn't object.
The chairmanâ And there are very
likely more to follow it.
Mr. Baconâ Then 1 shall have to pro
ceed.
The chairmanâ lf you wish to enter into
the record, Mr. Bacon, your objections to
all leading questions you may make that
entry now and they will be overruled, and
they are now overruled unless this com
mittee shall overrule me upon my ruling
and you do not need to make any further
objections. You can have it entered in
record that such questions are objected
to and the objections are overruled. If
you want such a record you may make it.
Mr. Baconâ l do not want any such
record. I desire to reserve the right to
object to leading questions.
Mr. Mellickâ l look at it this way: that
there is some reason for Mr. Bacon's ob
jection, yet at the same time I can ap
preciate the delicate position in which
our Speaker is in in regard to these ques
tions. Now, he don't want to bring out
any conclusion or any testimony against
any man, and perhaps would rather have
them brought out by questions, I sup
pose. Now. so far as these leading ques
tions are concerned, I would like to under
stand which way Mr. Wright would
rather be examined.
The witness â Mr. Mellick, I have no de
sire, gentlemen of the committee, to be
examined except to get at the truth. The
questions that may be leading or be re
garded as leading, if they lead to the
truth, are the questions to put to me. I
have been charged by a newspaper with
accepting money from a candidate in re
turn for my vote for that candidate for
Senator. They have attempted to prove
it and I declare it untrue. Now, the way
to proceed is within the hands of this
committee; and if the proof can be got
here and from me now by questions that
this committee propound, and they are
proper, I have no objections to answering
them at aJI.
The chairmanâ At the time that Mr.
Green gave you this $900 was there any
agreement, express or implied, that in
consideration thereof you should vote, if
elected, for U. S. Grant Jr. for United
States Senator.
A. No. On the other hand there was an
agreement, absolute and complete, that the
Senatorial question should not enter into it
in any degree whatever between Mr.
Grant and myself. The relationship exist
ed simply upon the friendship that was
known to exist in the community and
throughout the State between him and me
for years.
Q. Prior to receiving this $900 had you
expressed yourself to Mr. Green as being
favorable, if elected, to his candidate for
United States Senator?
A. No, sir. except in this way: I said in
talking to him one morning just leaving
himâ l remember the morning and the in
cident wellâ just parting from him at tne
ferryâ l said, "Well, Mr. Green, if the is
sue should get to be Grant and De Young,
1 am for Grant."
y. At that time was the candidacy of
D. M. Burns for the United States Sen
atorship under discussion by the politi
cians at all?
A. It was undreamed of so far as I
knew anything of it.
Q. Nothing hud been said of it in the
public print so far as you knew?
A. I never had seen a word.
Q. No intimation had been brought to
you? A
A. None whatever.
Q. That he would be a candidate?
A. None whatever. i
Q. Did you have at that time an under
standing as to who would probably be an
important competitor of Mr. Grant for
that position?
A. Well, I had understood that Mr. de
Young w r otild be a candidate and, in fact,
knew that he was an active candidate, de
spite his letter announcing that he was
not, printed in the Examiner and the
Chronicle. I knew it from politicians
who are active in Republican councils.

A. Not one cent.
Q. Did you receive any other money
from Mr. Green subsequent to the receiv
ing of this $900?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. What money did you receive? State

A. I was in Sacramento on some busi

north, where I was going to close up some
land matters. While here I received a
letter from an intimate friend of my fam
ily and whose name, it has been of keen
regret to me. has had to be brought into
this matter at all. who knows no more of
politics than a child. He and I had had
some business relations and he held my
note for $750, which, at tne time I was in
Sacramento, was not yet due. He wrote
me a letter telling me that his father In
the State of Washington had written to
him. asking him if he would send him
$1000 to take up a mortgage which existed
and which was just due and which he
wished to pay oft. My friend wrote to me
nuking whether I could accommodate him
in advance of the expiration of the note,
and said that ir meant a great deal to
him. I w-as indeed anxious to do so. 1
!Â«td but an hour or two while here and
wrote, inclosing this letter, and sent It
to Mr. Green, my friend, and asked him
if he could conveniently, without injury
to himself to do so, I would be glad to
have him send tills money over to Mr.
Yeazell in Berkeley, my friend, and that
upon the closing of my land transaction
I would return the money to him. In
view of this he did so. That Is all.
Q. Did you give any note or other form
of contract or promise to pay that sum
back again?
A. Except the promise contained in the
letter, no.
Q. I understood you that no part of that
money went into your candidacy?
A. Not a cent of It.
Q. Or into the political pot at all?
A. Not one cent of it.
Q. At the time you received this $750 in
this indirect manner from Mr. Green was
anything said between you and Mr. Green
concerning the candidacy of U. S. Grant
for United States Senator?
A. In regard to my vote on that ques
tion?
Q. Yes.
A. Not a word.
Q. Was there any promise, direct, ex
pressed or implied, that you should do
anything to advance the interests of U.
S. Grant In his aspirations to become
United States Senator by reason of hav
ing received that financial assistance ex
pressed In your letter?
A. Emphatically not.
Q. Was there riny moral obligation laid
upon you by reason of your relations to
Mr. Green to vote for Mr. Grant by rea
son of having received that $750?
A. Between him and me; no.
Q. Between you and Mr. Orant?
Q. Mr. Wright, can you point this com
mittee to any means whereby they rna>
learn of any improper influences brought
to bear by Mr. Grant. Mr Burns ori UXJ
other candidate for United fata tes BtenÂ»
tor in the matter of securing the votea
of any of the members of this Legisla

A. No. sir; I cannot. . .
Q. Do you know of any money having
been used by any other candidate ror
United States"Senator than that you have
named to advance his interests as candi
date for United States Senator?
A. I do not. Â
Mr. Baconâ Strike out that answer if
you please. I desire to object to that qu< â¢
tion. Now. I object to that as suggesting
something that is not proven.
The chairmanâ l think your objection is
well taken, Mr. Bacon, and I will ask tne
commltte.' to withdraw my question.
Mr. Mellickâ Just order It ptrlcken out.
The chairmanâ Very well; with the com
mon consent of the committee that may
be stricken out.
Q. Do you know of any money having
been used by any candidate for th-' OUted
States Senate to Influence the votes or
any member or members of this Legisla
ture?
A. I do not. . . _ 4
Mr. Devlinâ lf you have finished that
line of examination I would like to have
you ask Mr. Wright about the conversa
tions with Mr. Leake.
The chairmanâ Have any of the mem
bers of the committee questions to ask on
that line?
Mr. Lardner â Has any note or re
ceipt ever been given by you, Mr.
Wright, for that $900 P
A. No, air.
Q. Do you know that this is an
absolute gift by Mr. Green to youP
A. I should say yes.
Q. You considered it a gift by
Mr. Green to you?
A. In the light of his explana
tion that, as a friend, he wished to
see my candidacy â that he wished to
see me succeed in the face of a hard
fight over there.
Q. That $900 I understand was expended
in securing the delegates for the con
vention?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. The $750 loanâ has that been re
turned?
A. Not yet.
Q. That Is only evidenced by your let
ter, as I understand you.
A. Yes. sir.
Q. â Have you had any conversa
tion with Mr. Green relative to
whether the $900 is a gift or not?
A.â No, sir.
Q. â As I understand you do not
propose to return the $900 P
A. â There is no such understand
ing. There is no expression here. I
have made no such expression.
Q. â Well, I was asking you
whether you did intend to return
the $900?
A. â I shall have to consider the
matter before deciding.
Q. Do you know whether Mr. Green is
a wealthy man?
A. I had always thought he was pretty
well off. He has talked of many busi
ness transactions to me which involved
many sums of money and made me feel
that he was very well off. indeed.
Q. Do you know whether he aided and
assisted from his own means or those of
any other candidate?
A. I do not, Mr. Lardner.
Q. In this campaign?
A. No. I do not.
Q. Does Mr. Green live in your partic
ular district?
A. No; he lives just outside the dis
trict.
Q. Just outside of your district?
A. But it isâ he lives in Oakland.
Q. You knew, as I understand, that he
was a friend of Mr. Grant's. Am I cor
rect in that?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. And I understand you, you did not
know until arriving here in Sacramento
that the money was Mr. Grant's money? .
A. I did not know it until the testimony
was offered here by Mr. Green himself.
Q. You never saw the $750 check, I be
lieve?
A. No; never did.
Mr. Mellickâ You got the receiptâ you
got your note back from your friend, I
suppose?
A. Oh, yes.
Q. There is an evidence of that money
having been returned to him?
A. Yes, the payment.
Q. â This $900 â there seemed to
be a controversy last night as to
whether you got it yourself or some
body else?
A. â No, I got it myself.
Q.â You got the $900 P
A. â Yes, sir.
Q. â In cash yourselfP
A. â Yes, sir.
Q. â Directly from Mr. GCreenf'
A. â Yes.
Q. Now, then, the papers have charged
that you had spent more than what your
sworn affidavit of campaign expenses
showed. Can you tell a little about that?
It shows they claim $74 as the amount of
campaign expenses, I believe.
A. Yes. This money, Mr. Mellick, was
all expended before the nomination.
Q. Yes; but this means was there any
other money?
A. No; not at all.
Q. Than the $74?
A. No, sir; nothing.
Q. After you had the nomination, why,
you had to conduct the fight?
A. Oh, it 16 equivalent to an election.
There is where the fight has to be made
in that district always. It has never been
anything but strongly Republican, except
In "the case of two independent Republi
cans splitting up the district at one time.
Q. And let us seeâ what waa your ma
jority two years ago?
A. Fifteen hundred.
Q. And what was it this time?
A. Eleven hundred.
Q. Eleven hundred majority?
A. Yes.
Mr. Devlinâ Do you want to take up
those conversations with Mr. Leake, so
the witness may set himself right? Mr. '
Leake made several charges against him.
I want to suggest to the committee that
the ground may be covered.
The chairmanâ Do you remember the
day that The Call came out in advocacy
of your aspirations to be Speaker of the
Assembly?
A. I do not remember the day. I think
it was about the 14th or 15th of Decem-
ber.
Q. Do you remember the event?
A. Yes, sir; very well.
Q. Do you remember of meeting with
Mr. Leake and Mr. Spreckels in the of
fice of The Call in San Francisco?
A. Very well.
Q. Do you remember the conversations
that there took place?
A. I think I do.
Q. Did you then state to Mr. Leake
and Mr. Spreckels that you were not in
any manner obligated to any individual
or any corporation so that you couid not
give every one proper representation?
A. Yes, sir.
Mr. Devlinâ Perhaps it might be better,
Mr. Chairman, to let the witness state
the conversation.
The witnessâ Mr. Cosper. it Bays I was
not obligated to any individual?
Q. Yes.
A. I owed Mr. Green $7?0: and I do not
suppose he used it in that sense.
Q. No, I don't suppose so.
A. But what I suppose he meant was
whether if elected Speaker my appoint
ments of committees, etc., would be free
from corporate or individual or Senato
rial influences. That is what I assumed.
Q. That is the sense in which you as
sumed the question?
A. Yes. air. And I declared emphati
cally, yes.
Mr. Devlinâ Perhups he had better de
tail the conversation.
The chairmanâ l wanted him to be able
Germany and Asia Minor.
It is inevitable that Asia Minor shall eventa

stated these things to Mr. Leake, and
then he can give the entire conversation.

there is some question about the title."
"Well," I said, "is he holding them con

people say so. but." he said, "that is not
so. The land belongs to him, and Works,

I have talked to Mr. Works: I have taken
his application, as I Intend to take the ap
plication of every Assemblyman, and L
am going to form my committees without
regard to corporate influence, newspaper
influence, or individual influence." and I
challenge the investigation of any one
along that line to establish the con
trary. Later he asked me not to ap
point Mr. Crowder on the Public Building
and Grounds Committee as I had indi
cated that he wished and to put instead
?ome other man whom I do not now re

Mr Colver (representing The Call)â
Now, Mr. Mellick. can I suggest a (jues

Â«r. Mellickâ lt don't make any differ- 1
[ ence to me. I would just as soon as not.

you, Mr. Wright, if at the time that you
! had this interview with Mr. Leake on a

A. I do not remember, Mr. Cosper. I
may have. My remembrance isâ my rec
ollection isâ l asked Mr. Burke.
The chairmanâ The gentleman may
1 state the question.
Mr Colverâ Did you not meet me on
Friday evening last In the Golden Eagle
Hotel barroom, about S:3O o'clock, and re
quest me to step across the road and ask
: Mr. Leake to come over and see you; that
you wanted to see him upon very im
portant business?
The witnessâ l don't remember. I re
member asking Mr. BurKe to ask Mr.
Leake to come over, but I don t remem
ber asking Mr. Colver. I may have done
so. 1 don't say 1 did not, but don't re
member having done it.
Mr Colverâ You then requested an in

A. Yes.
Q." You sought the interview?
A. Yes; I think so.
Q. Mr. Leake did not seek you?
A. I don't recollect. You are not the
Mr Burnettâ l understand it has been
decided somewhere that whatever ques
tions are to be asked, be asked by some
member of the committee. Is that cor
rect ?
The chairmanâ No, not quite, because
we permit the lawyers to ask them. I
don't think it would do to go into it gen
-1 .-rally by any other than the committee.
i But I permitted him because I thought it
would save time.
Mr. Burnettâ l do not think there
I should be any preference shown. Any
' questions to be asked should be handed
i to the chairman and asked by him.
The chairmanâ Wright, how much
! money did you expend in your Assembly
contest after the primaries, up to the
time of the election?
A. I think the amount is $74, although
I am not positive.
Mr. Wadeâ He testified to that, did not
he?
The witnessâ l think that is so.
The chairmanâ you tell Mr. Leake
j that the money received from Milton
I Green was in return for your promise to
support the Senatorial candidacy of U. S.

campaign, In order to insure your elec
tion to the Assembly?
A. No, sir; I did not.
Q. Did you tell him that you were go
ing to continue to work and vote for D.
M. Burns?
A. I did.
Q. Did you tell him that you intended
to ease your conscience by making resti
tution to Mr. Grant?
A. I did not.
Q. Did you tell him that you would pay j
back to Mr. Grant the money that Mr. !
Green had given you?
A. I did not.
Q. Did you say to him that you were i
forcedâ did you say to him in a conver
sation at the Golden Eagle Hotel in this I
city that you were forced to admit the
; truth of the statement that you had re
ceived money from Grant, or rather from
Mr. Green, his political manager, with
the understanding that you should sup

Q. Mr. Leake.
A. No, sir. Never mentioned Pringle's j
name to him at all.
Q. Did you, as a matter of fact, use any
of the money that Mr. Green gave you to
buy off Mr. Pringle, so that he should
not be a candidate lor trie Assembly?
A. I did not. Mr. Pringle was not
bought off by me or any one else. ,

Pringle withdrew from the Assembly
, race?
i A. Because he felt that the candidacy of
his friend, Mr. Jordan, was in danger by
his remaining in it.

1 which he withdrew that you know of?
A. That was the only consideration.

' ten to Mr. Green from the Slitter Club
telling him that you needed a certain
amount of money to meet a pressing debt?
A. I did.
Q. And you told him, did you, that Mr.
' Green paid the debt for you?
A. I did. That was in answer to Mr.

, himself.
Q. Did you tell Mr. Leake that you had
j received "in all from Mr. Green the sum
i Of $1650?

A. I did not. I told Mr. Leake that the
debt of $750 wasâ as expressed in the let
ter which I supposed he had in his hand,
; and which, if Mr. Green's testimony is
' to be believed, has never been outside his
I safe â was an indebtedness which called
for repayment and certainly would be re
-1 paid.
Q. Did you tell Mr. Leake?
A. And Mr. Leake said: "I wouldn't

The chairman, to Robert Devlin: Would
i that cover all the conversations that you
I desire?
Mr Devlinâ l think so, unless Mr.
Wright wants to make any other expla
nation.
The chairmanâ l would like to hear him.
The witnessâ l do not see that there is
| anything further unless the committee
has something.
Mr. Burnettâ in that conversation
at the Golden Eagle, as Mr. Leake has
given it here, and I have looked over, it
appears that Mr. Leake said that you
asked him a question, "Have you heard
of a certain member having received
! money"? sir. I want to say in that con-
A No, sir. I want to say in that con-
I nection Mr. Leake said to me when he
exhibited that letterâ he said, "I know
where this money has been coming from.
I know I can destroy Mr. Grant's
; candidacy because I have in my
possession proof of the fact
that he paid Senator Cutter, that he paid
Mr. Jilson. that he paid Mr. Rawâ to
vole for him." And alsoâ this was the first
announcementâ you yourself have
received money, because you wrote a let
ter from the Sutter Club, which I have."
That is the first time that I ever heard
of Senator Cutter or Mr. Raw or Mr.
Jilson in connection with anything of the
kind, the statement of Mr. Leake himself <
to me. . â  , ,
Mr. Mellickâ Leake said that you said
that you had heard of it?
A. Yes, sir. â 
The chairmanâ Have you detailed all
the conversation relative to the matters
involved in this examination that you
have had with Mr. LoÂ»ke, as you now re
member
THE SAX FBANCISCO CALL, THTJBSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1899.
A. Top, sir.
Q. And 11' you remember any other you
will suggest them to the committee, will
you?
A. I have no remembrance of any other.
Q. If you remember any otherâ recall
any other?
A. Yes, sir.
Wright's testimony was still coming
from Sacramento at the time of going
to press.
Milton J. Green appeared voluntarily
before the committee and asked per
mission to make a statement.
Mr. Greenâ Mr. Chairman and gentle
men: My attention has just been called
to the fact that Mr. Aldcn Anderson has
testified to-night, and while I have no
knowledge of the exact nature of his tes
timony and only a street rumor of what
he did testify toâ
The chairmanâ Wait, Mr. Green. To
morrow the testimony of Alden Anderson
will have been written out in full and
transcribed, and perhaps you would tes
tify with much more forte if you knew
Just what his testtimony was.
A. Well, I can testify "as to what actu
ally took place, and if he testified to any
thing different 1 am ready to deny it.
The chairmanâ l simply wanted to give
you the opportunity of a full denial, if
you want to deny it; that is all. You can
use your own Judgment about It.
The witnessâ l knew Mr. Anderson;
made his acquaintance two years ago in
Sacramento, at which time he was a
member of the Assembly and voted for
Senator Perkins, and that acquaintance,
thus begun, continued, in fact, down to
the present time. One day I noticed that
Mr. Anderson was registered at the
Grand Hotel in San Francisco, and I left
a card in the box for him and asked him
to come over and call on me. He did so,
and I asked him what sort of a fight he
had in his county. Well, he said, he did
not know; that he thought he probably
could win it. but of course those things
were uncertain. I asked him who his op
ponent was, and my recollection is he
told me it was a gentleman by the name
of White. I am not certain about the
name. I think it was White; and I asked
him what sort of a canvass Mr. White,
or his opponent, whatever his name was,
was going to make. He said that when
the campaign first opened Mr.
White was annarently apathetic, but, so
far as ho was able to discover, Mr. White
had received considerable assistance
financial assistance â from some source,
and he did not know where; but he as
sumed it came from some place outside of
Solano County. I told him that, as he
knew, we were interested in the election
of a Republican Legislature and I snould
be very glad to contribute to his election;
that, of course, 1 had no desire to exact
any pledge from him, or ask him to make
any promises of any sort but that, inter
ested as we were in the elec
tion of a Republican Legislature
I would be perfectly wiling to contribute
to his success. And I asked him what he
presumed his campaign expenses would
amount to. He said he thought probably
about $500. I said then, "Well, I am per
fectly willing to contribute a portion if
not all of those expenses," and he s.iiil.
"No, it was not necessary for me to do any
thing that day. but 1 will come down
and Bee you next week, and in any event."
he said, "I will go on and make my cam
paign and after the election is over I will
Keep a memorandum of what I have ex
pended, and if you are willing to refund
any portion of It, or all of it, it will be
all right," and 1 said. "Well, Anderson,
if you feel that you need any money to
day I will be glad to let you have it," and
I opened my safe and took out $250 and I
said, "If you need this to-day I will be
glad to let you have it," and he said.
"No. you let it go, and I will bo down
next week."
Then we talked about the Senatorial
question and he said of course he was
very much interested in Senator Perkins 1
re-election. 1 told him I was glad to
know it; that, of course, in my judgment
Senator Perkins' re-election depended, to
a large extent, upon the election of a
Senator from the south at this time; and
I showed him, in confidence, a letter
written by Senator Perkins to a gentle
man in relation to Mr. Grant's candidacy.
That was the sum and substance of the
conversation I had with Mr. Anderson
at that time. He did not come back. 1
think I saw him once or twice afterward,
and I never referred to the subject, and
I never have since asked him the amount
of his campaign expenses or asked him
if he wished me to refund any portion
of it, or all of It. I never, at that time
or at any other time, said that I
would make a contribution to his
cause, in consideration of his voting for
Mr. Grant, and never intimated anything
of the sort. On the contrary, I told him
that I had no desire whatever to hamper
him with pledges or to exact any prom
ise from him, but was perfectly willing,
for the purpose of securing his electionâ
and necessarily so, in view of his state
ment that he had made to me, that his
opponent was receiving material financial
assistance, to contribute to his election.
But I wish to deny in as positive and em
phatic terms as I can, that I ever offered
Mr. Anderson any contribution or any as
sistance, as a consideration for his sup
porting Mr. Grant, and I never intimated
anything to that effect. Now, if Mr. An
derson has testified to anything: different
I desire to deny it and to brand it as an
infamous falsehood.
Mr. Mellickâ Do you mean to say thatâ
at least, what you have said was the ex
act conversation that you had, between
yourself and Mr. Anderson?
A. I am satisfied it is; yes, sir.
Q. The exact conversation?
A. Oh, no; I would not pretend to give
it word for word.
y. Why, then, do you say that anything
to the contrary is an infamous falsehood?
A. Anything to the contrary to the ef
fect tha"t I had said to Mr. Anderson, or
intimated to him, or suggested to him,
that if he would promise to vote for Mr.
Grant. I would be willing to assist him.
Q. He did not say so?
A. That portion of it is absolutely false.
y. He did not say so?
A. The word was brought to me that
he did, and I hastened here for the pur
pose of denying it.
Q. You were misinformed about that.
A. I don't desire to do Mr. Anderson or
anybody else an injustice; but I did not
propose to sleep this night with any such
falsehood hanging over me.
Mr. Green was asked If he desired any
further time in which to consider the ad
visability of answering the question pro
pounded to him to-day which he had de
clined to answer, namely: "To give the
numbers of the several Assembly districts
in which contributions were made by him
to aid in the election of a Republican Leg
islature."
He replied that so far as that matter
was concerned, his refusal to answer the
interrogation waÃ final.
Mr Green was then directed to appear
at the bar of the House at 10 o'clock to-
morrow.
BILLS TO HELP TIE
AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS
CAI,Li HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. IS.â The prediction of Sen
ator Langford, the father of the Senate,
that the session of 1599 would probably
result In more good to the agricultural
interests than any of tne recent previous
sessions bids fair to be realized. Already
bills are in relieving the district agricul
tural societies of the burden of debt that
has hampered their efficient working, and
now irrigation matters are coming in for
more than their usual meed of attention.
The problem of bringing water to the
naturally fruitful soil of the San Joaquin

proposing the building of storage reser
voirs and the husbanding of water sup

surveys to be made uro-und the head
waters of all streams running through
arid lands or lands that would be bene

termining where storage reservoirs and
diverting dams for the diversion of flood
waters could be most advantageously
built.
The first surveys are to be made along

MENTO, Jan. IS.â "There is absolutely no

SPAIN READY
TO CEDE THE
EASTERN ISLANDS
The President's Commission to
the Philippines Will Go Out in
an Advisory Capacity.
> LONDON, Jan. 19.â The Spanish Cabinet, according to the Madrid
' correspondent of the Daily Mail, has decided to submit a bill to the
* Cortes sanctioning the cession of the Philippines before presenting the
[ peace treaty for ratification.
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Presi
dent McKinley is expected to announce
in a few days the Instructions he has
given to the Schurman Commission,
which will investigate economic condi
tions existing in the Philippine Islands.
Mr. Schurman had a final conference
with the President this morning and is
making arrangements to leave San
Francisco, by the latter part of the
month. Professor Dean C. Worcester
of Ann Arbor University reached
Washington to-day and will confer
with the President to-morrow. It is
expected that he will sail with Presi
dent Schurman. Colonel Denby's work
with the War Investigation Commission
may prevent his departure with his
colleagues, but he will sail soon after

Upon the arrival of the commission

a Government transport and proceed in
it to Manila, where they will meet Ma

Dewey. Under instructions given to
the commissioners they will make a
thorough investigation of the habits
and the economic and social conditions
of the Filipinos and will make a report
upon the character of government
which, in their opinion, is best suited
for them. The commission is entirely
advisory to the President and its re

CHAMBERLAIN HOPEFUL
. FOR "OPEN-DOOR" POLICY
LONDON, Jan. 18.â Rt. Hon. Joseph
Chamberlain, Secretary of State for the
Colonies, speaking to-night at the ban
quet of the "Wolverhampton Chamber
of Commerce, reviewed at great length
the various threatening foreign ques
tions confronting the Government.
In connection with the withdrawal of
the French demand for an extension of
the settlement at Shanghai, Mr. Cham
berlain congratulated his hearers that
Great Britain's opposition to the pro
posal had been supported by the rep
resentatives of the United States.
"That, I think," he said, "a significant
and noteworthy fact. Nay, I think and
hope it will become history. It shows
that circumstances are bringing about
the community of interests between
Anglo-Saxons, which in the future may
have far-reaching and beneficial re
sults."
Smith and his motion was carried as soon
as Speaker pro tern. Anderson could put
it to the house.
The two ballots taken to-day made no
change in the vote. It is the same an
yesterday and the clay before and as it
will be to-morrow, unless every indica
tion is false.
Grant polled his full voteâ 2Sâ on the first
ballot for the first time this week. As
semblyman Raw of El Dorado, who has
been .seriously indisposed, was again in
his seat, as was Chynoweth of Orange.
Speaker Wright was engaged at the meet
ing of the investigation committee and
could not be on hand to cast his dollar
marked vote for the Mexican candidate,
Burns as a consequence got but 25 of his
list of 26.
General Barnes polled his usual ten and
Bulla held on with the nine who have
stayed by him.
Knight, Scott, Estee, Paterson, Bard
and Rosenfeld got their customary two.
Democratic honors were divided, though
not evenly, between Stephen M. "White
and Marlon De Vries. White got 2.), De
Vriea 2.
On the second ballot Grant tallied one
vote short on account of Raw having
paired with Speaker Wright, refusing to
vote.
The Grant people have decided to stay
where they are until the end of the pres
ent week, anyway, but they are casting
about for some one to whom they may
throw their strength with no danger of
electing Burns by doing so. It was
feared by some of them that Chynoweth
would bolt the camp when the vote came
on this morning, but he is lined up as
solidly as ever and with every intention
of staying with the crowd until it is con
vinced its cause is hopeless.
Following are the results of the twen
tieth and twenty-first ballots:
Barnesâ lo.
Bullaâ 9.
Burnsâ 2s.
Feltonâ l.
Grantâ 2B.
Knightâ 2.
Esteeâ 2.
Scottâ 2.
Patersonâ 2.
Bardâ 2.
De Vriesâ 2.
Rosenfeldâ 2.
Whiteâ 29.

ELECTRICITY BENEFICIAL
TO BISHOP NEWMAN
NEW YORK, Jan. IS. âBishop John P.
Newman of the Methodist Episcopal
Church of California, after a month's
treatment with an electric current, is in a
fair way to complete recovery from an
injury received many years ago. Bishop
Newman said to-day:
"I came East a month ago for medical
treatment and visited a physician who
makes a specialty of electricity. He dis
covered a lesion at the base of the spine,
due to my accident in California, and
which I had entirely overlooked. Since
then I have had diffusive system elec
tricity applied to me for one and two
hours at a time several days a week. I
am almost completely well again and can
walk excellently."

a high tribute to the success of Lord
Salisbury's foreign policy, remarking:
"It is cause for satisfaction that two
great nations, Germany and the United
States, both protectionists at home,
have proclaimed their intention to ad
here to the principle of the 'open door'
in their foreign possessions. We shall
regard their expansion without jeal
ousy and Ishall welcome their co-oper
ation; and I think, without being too
sanguine, we may rely upon their sym
pathy and assistance in securing the
general adoption of a principle to which
â we attach so much importance."
WILL SUPERINTEND THE
PHILIPPINE POSTOFFICES
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â F. W.
Vaille of Oregon, who, on the acquisi
tion of the Philippine Islands, was dis
patched to Manila as United States pos
tal agcrit, to be In charge there, will
shortly be appointed director of posts
for that archipelago, with functions
similar to those of an assistant post
master here. He will have complete
control, under the supervision of Post
master General Charles Emory Smith
of the administration of the postal af
fairs of those islands.
Mr. Vaille has been in the service as
assistant superintendent of the railway
mail service at Portland, Or., for nine
years. He Is a native of Massachu
setts. As postal agent he has made a
strong record in organizing and extend
ing a postal scheme there. It had been
suggested to send a commission of ex
perts to the Philippines, with a view of
making recommendations for the ser
vice, but the Postmaster General, espe
cially in view of the small number of
offices, decided against that action as
unnecessary, and will directly entrust
the executive responsibility to Mr.
Veille. The latter will make constant
reports, advising the administration
here of the postal situation in that por
tion of the east.
CARLISTS IN SPAIN
READY FOR RISING
LONDON", Jan. 18.â The Paris cor
respondent of the Daily Graphic says:
One of the principal chiefs of the Car
lists here informs me that everything
is now ready for a rising in Spain; that
Don Carlos is absolutely resolved to
take the field and that all are waiting
for the signal.
GERMANY INVITES
WAR OVER SAMOA
Defiance of America and
England.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUCKLAND, N. Z., Jan. IS.â Further
advices from Samoa are to the effect
that after Chief Justice Chambers had
declared Malietoa King the Consuls of
the United States and Great Britain
and the captains of the German war
ship Falke and the British warship
Porpoise met the German Consul, who
refused to recognize Malietoa and de
clined to co-operate in the disposal of
the Samoans, who thereupon assembled
in large numbers at Mulinuu, armed
themselves and surrounded the mu
nicipality. Malietoa and Tamasese
mustered about 2000 men, well armed,
but supplied with defective ammuni
tion. The British and American Con
suls endeavored to avert hostilities, but
they were commenced on January 1.
Malietoa and Tamasese fought brave
ly, but 500 of their followers were cap
tured. Then, disheartened and out
numbered, the two chiefs sought refuge
on the British warship, and their fol
lowers sought protection under the
guns of the Porpoise. Mataafa's loss
was sixty-one .men killed and wounded,
and Malietoa lost twelve men killed and
wounded.
The followers of Mataafa looted and
burned Apia,
It transpires that Dr. Raffel. assisted
by the German Consul, closed the Su
preme Court, the two declaring: that
the power was vested in them. The
British and American Consuls then
appealed to the captain of the British
ship Porpoise, who landed bluejackets,
and Chief Justice Chambers, under
their guard, took his seat. Mataafa
held aloof from these last develop
ments.
LONDON, Jan. 19.â The Times, com
menting on the trouble in Samoa, says
that the only satisfactory feature ap
pears to have been the cordial co
operation of the British and American
authorities.

SAN JOSE, Jan. IS.â The Councitmen
failed to appear at the meeting: this
afternoon and consequently nothing
was done toward selecting a City
Treasurer. Members of the Council en
deavored to get Mayor Martin into a
conference to-day but failed. A special
meeting is called for to-morrow after
noon, when, Martin says, he will re
name Colombet. The treasury remains
closed and interest in the deadlock Is
increasing. There is an unusually large
number of applicants for the treasurer
ship.

MRS. DICKINSON
GIVEN A BREATH
OF FRESH AIR
For a Brief Hour the Woman Ac
cused of Conspiracy to Mur
der* Enjoys Freedom.
SUISUN, Jan. 18.â Mrs. Dickinson [
was given a breath of fresh air this j
afternoon and for fully an hour the
woman, who Is accused of having been j
the head of the conspiracy that resulted j
in the murder of old Dan Wilson, was
free from the restraint of prison bars
and vigilant Deputy Sheriffs. Attorney !
Lamont visited the Sheriff's office J
shortly after 2 o'clock and requested an i
interview with his client. The at
| torney has a well-defined aversion to
1 the gloomy old jail, and as there was
no private room in the Courthouse to |
which they could retire, he suggested
that he be allowed to take the prisoner
to his office, which is just across the
road. His suggestion was favorably j
received and Mrs. Dickinson was j
escorted to the office of her lawyer for j
a consultation. She appeared greatly J
downcast and the assurances of L.a- I
mont did not appear to have a very I
cheering effect, for when she returned J
to the Jail she sorrowfully expressed
the hope that "no other innocent per- !
son will ever have to endure what I am j
going through."
Later in the day Mrs. Dickinson sent
a request to the Sheriff's office for the
daily papers, adding the proviso that 'â 
she did not care for them if the articles j
relating to the Wilson case were cut ]
out. As nothing bearing on the case j
is allowed in the jail her request was
not granted.
District Attorney Devlin is busily
engaged in preparing for the prelimi
nary examination, which is set for next
Tuesday. He has carefully gone over
the evidence given at the Coroner's
inquest and the statements of wit
nesses whose testimony is relied upon t
to hold the three prisoners in the
County Jail for trial in the Superior
Court. Much of the evidence has no j
value when taken separately and some j
of the witnesses are far from being j
wholly satisfactory to the prosecution, j
but when taken as a whole the evidence j
is believed to be amply sufficient to !
warrant the prisoners being held.
Detective Stranahan, who collected '
the major part of the testimony against j
Mrs. Dickinson and Mrs. Wilson and '
Miller, is one of the witnesses whose
veracity is regarded as open to criti- i
cism and the amateur sleuth will not i
be called upon to take the witness !
stand. The fruits of his efforts, how- i
ever, are capable of corroboraion to a
great extent, so that the absence of the
man who was one of the chief figures
in the prosecution may not materially
weaken the State's case.
The main features or facts upon
which the prosecution will build its
case, so far as known, consist of the
alleged secret visit of Miller to the
Wilson ranch on the evening of the
murder; the peculiar actions of Mrs.
Dickinson and Mrs. Wilson, who, the
prosecution will endeavor to prove, dis

played guilty restlessness while wait
ing to hoar the report of the gun which
was the death knell of old Dan Wilson,
and who were in bed and fully dressed
when notified of the assassination a few
hours later, and the incriminating re
mark and admissions alleged to have
been made by all three of the accused
prisoners at various times during the
two years which have elapsed since the
consummation of the deed.
This is the case of the prosecution in
outline, so far as known at this time,
but it is intimated that when the proper
time arrives a surprise of the sensa
tional sort will be sprung which will
leave no doubt of the guilt of the ac
cused and render their conviction ab
solutely certain.
So far as the defense is concerned, it
depends wholly upon the testimony of
the Sheehan girls, Maggie and Kate, of
Vallejo. If they adhere to the story
they have heretofore told, when placed
on the witness stand to give their testi
mony under oath, they may do a great
deal in proving the alibi claimed by
Miller, providing their testimony is not
impeached by the prosecution. There
are many who doubt the veracity of the
Sheehan girls and the District Attorney
may controvert the effect of any tes
timony favorable to the defense they
may give my producing witnesses to
show they are not worthy of belief.
With the exception of Mrs. Dickin
son's somewhat brief outing, the threa
prisoners were left to their reflections
undisturbed to-day, in pursuance of
the policy adopted by Under Sheriff
Robinson several days ago. No visit
ors were admitted to the jail. The
enforced solitude is evidently wearing
on the alleged slayers of the old
rancher and they would gladly wel
come a return to the former plan of
being allowed to hold daily receptions.
Miller mantains his air of confidence to
a remarkable degree, but the women
make no attempt to conceal their ap
prehension. Sleepless nights, combined
with prison fare, which they scarcely
touch, are beginning to undermine
their health and the least thing is liable
to set them trembling with nervous
fears. They may not break down, but
should they collapse at any time no one
here would be in the least surprised.
They are not the same women physic
ally or mentally they were when first
placed behind the bars a week ago to
day.

THE UNCHANGED BLACK LIST.
ANOTHER day's balloting for Senator has!
passed :it Sacramento and the black list of 1
shameless legislators who in defiance of an
indignant public opinion vote for the disreputable
Burns remains the same. Since Speaker Wright

Grant's money in his pocket no member has followed
his slimy trail There is now reason to believe that 1
c will. The full measure of Burns' strength and 1
the disgrace of the Legislature has seemingly been !
bed, and the prospects are that when any change ;
it will be for the better.
â me let the people remember that the men!
have had so little regard for their own reputa

for the man whose handling of public money has
always resulted in a shortage and a criminal prosecu
tion are these:

THE CALLS NEWS SERVICE.
V' ESTERDAY The Call gave its readers a
double proof of the superiority of its news ser
vice over that of all its competitors combined.
It was the only papef in the city to publish a verbatim
report of the proceedings of the investigating com
mittee at Sacramento, and was also the only paper
to publish the cablegram from Auckland announcing
the i inbreak of war in the Samoan Islands.
These two items constituted the most important
events, local or foreign, of the day. No issue of do
ic affairs is so interesting or so noteworthy as
that involved in the hearing of the Senatorial scandal
at Sacramento. On that subject the people ought to
know the whole truth, and The Call gave it, while
the ether papers made a garbled digest, which fur
nished but an inadequate treatment of the subject.
The outbreak of the natives of the Samoan Islands
i;-. fraught with the danger of involving the United
States. Great Britain and Germany in the controversy,
for t!:e administration of the islands is under their
rol. The islands hold a strategic position in
the Southern Pacific, and the interests of the three
powers in them arc great. Therefore the news of the
outbreak is a matter of no small concern to the world
Oi course cablegrams and full stenographic reports
of important proceedings cost money. It would be
cheaper to fill ? newspaper with fake interviews with
the : of China or the Pope, and make a freak
affairs, but The Call is not that kind of
â  It docs no; fake, nor docs it spare money for
news. Those who wish to be posted must i
The Call.
If Speaker Wright has any brains
This is what he'll do:
He'll crawl into an auger-hole:
He'il crawl into a gimlet-hole;
And pull the hole in, too.
thcr the proposal of Speaker Wright to ex
clude representatives of The Call from the floor of
Hie Assembly has gone over or gone under is not
clear, but it is certainly gone.
Caesar had his Brutus, Ulysses Grant has had his
Green, and Dan Burns may profit by the example.
THE POLITICAL GRUBSTAKE-
IF it were not serious it would be amusing to wit
ness the Democratic horror at The Call's expo
sure of the system of political grubstaking fol
lowed by candidates for the United States Senate.
Under that system love and affection have no place,
but go to the limbo of obsolete things along with
party loyalty and State patriotism. It recognizes
money as the only merit in a candidate. A man may
have the accomplishments of the Admirable Crichton,
the patriotism of Washington, the profundity of Web
ster and the eloquence of Clay, but these qualifica
tions for the Senatorship cut no figure against an
ignorant and accidentally rich man who can grub
stake candidates for the Legislature and thereby se
cure their votes when elected.
Perhaps in the beginning this practice was not con
sidered reprehensible. When the late Senator Hearst
desired to acquire this great public honor he entered
upon an extensive grubstaking enterprise. Demo
cratic candidates whom he had not seen personally
received his check and a request to invest it in secur
ing those ballots declared by Whittier to â
" â¢ * â¢ fall as light as snowflakea on the sod.
But execute the freeman's will
As lightning does the will of God."
Several gentlemen returned these checks, and if
they succeeded in getting elected were viewed with
alarm, while those who kept the checks and were
elected were pointed to with pride. This system was
the cause of the enacti..ent of the purity of elections
law. Under it a legislative candidate appoints a
purity committee which audits his election expenses
and files the account under oath.
The revelations current at Sacramento make it ap
parent that some candidates needed an impurity com
mittee.
In the case of Speaker Wrong it is not yet estab
lished that his campaign accounts were audited at all
or that the members of his purity committee ever
made oath to the required statement.
One fact in his case stands out in forcible relief.
According to his own statement he paid an opponent
for the nomination to withdraw in his favor, and then
appointed the same man a member of his purity com
mittee! This money paid for the right of way to the
nomination was furnished from the exchequer of a
candidate for the United States Senate, and, though
contributed from that source as part of the Speaker's
political expenses, the gentleman to whom it was paid
did not find it among the audited accounts of the can
didate!
Since the introduction of the political grubstake the
system seems to have undergone changes and to have
been applied to the purchase of right of way in the
party convention as well as to the purpose of fighting
the common enemy, by opening the eyes of voters to
the virtues of the grubstaked candidate.
The student of statutes may get a list of suggestions
for amendment of the purity of elections law, for the
enforcement of the responsibilities of a purity com
mittee, and for getting purity and impurity far enough
apart so that one can be distinguished from the other.
As far as known this grubstake is a Democratic in
vention that has been pirated by certain Republican
politicians, though it is by no means sure that the
rightful owner of the invention will bring action for
d-mages.
THE COYOTE SCOLP STEAL.
A BILL has been introducted into the Legisla
ture appropriating $287,000, with which to
liquidate the coyote scalp claims incurred under
the statute repealed four years ago. The measure
provides that payment shall be made by the State
Treasurer during the next two fiscal years, so that
the entire burden will not fall in any one year. It is
enacted that the State Board of Examiners shall ex
amine all the claims and pay only those which seem
to it just and proper.
While, of course, it is absolutely necessary that the
coyote claims should be thoroughly investigated, we
do not think the power to make the inquiry should
be conferred upon the State Board of Examiners.
That body consists of the Governor, Secretary of
State and Attorney General, three officials who have
plenty to do without this additional duty. In the na
ture of things they cannot give to the subject the at
tention it deserves, which is a serious matter, since
not a single coyote claim should be paid until some
body is thoroughly satisfied that it is genuine.
It is notorious that during the time the statute re
ferred to was in force coyote farming in certain por
tions of the State was a profitable industry. It has
been charged on excellent authority that many agri
culturists in the mountain counties added coyote
scalps to their regular output and made a great deal
of money thereby. It is also well known that large
numbers of coyotes were killed in Arizona and
Nevada and their scalps brought into this State.
There was at one time suftkient evidence to establish
the fact that bales of coyote scalps were authenti
cated in several different counties, being shipped from
one to the other by collusive County Clerks.
Moreover, these claims have all now taken on a
speculative character. They have been purchased at
enormous discounts from the original holders and
have fallen into the hands of banks and capitalists.
The biennial attempt to pay them, therefore, has be
come a regular raid upon the treasury. Two years
ago money was openly used in the lobby to pass a
bill appropriating money to pay them, and consid
erable scandal resulted from charges preferred against
one man of bribing a member of the Legislature.
The Legislature owes it to itself to see that this
bill does not pass until ample provision has been
made for a thorough investigation of the claims and
the establishment of their genuineness. Any other
course cannot fail to result in the actual looting of
the treasury.
A GROSS INJUSTICE.
UNDER the decision of the Commissioner of In
ternal Revenue, that the war revenue act pro
hibits tobacco dealers from selling in broken
packages, or small quantities, a wrong will be done
to an industrious portion of the people which
amounts to a gross injustice â one so gross, indeed,
that it threatens to deprive many families of their
means of subsistence and reduce them to penury.
The circumstances are these: In San Francisco
and in every American city of considerable popula
tion there are a number of persons who carry on
the industry of cigar-making in a small way. These
Workers are not able to purchase tobacco in large
quantities, for the limited extent of their trade and
their means do not permit it. Their industry, there
fore, depends upon their ability to obtain tobacco in
small quantities as they require it. and as the new
law. according to the decision of the Commissioner,
forbids the sale in that way, the industry is virtually
suppressed by an act of Congress.
The evil is all the more offensive because the eco
! nomic tendencies of the age are already heavily han
; dicanping the small producer or manufacturer in
j competition with the giant corporations and trusts
j which control so much capital. The large manufac
j turers of cigars have a hundred advantages over the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, JANUARY 19, 1899.
smaller cigar-makers by reason of the very nature of
our economic system. It is, therefore, a most griev
ous wrong that the law should step in and give such
further advantage to the big factories as will suppress
the independent workers altogether.
It is stated by the Commissioner in his decision, as
an explanation of the adoption of the new rule, that
'"increased rates of tax on tobacco products enforces
a more careful supervision over the sale and disposi
tion of leaf tobacco." As an explanation that may be
ample, but as a justification it is worth nothing. The
United States are not so poor that they havf4o im
pose taxes that literally crush out the industries of
the people. There are many ways in which the needed
revenues of the Government may be raised without
resorting to such exactions upon small industries,
and if the tobacco tax cannot be collected under the
new law with as little injustice as under the old it
would be better to return to the former rate.
The issue is one which cannot be postponed. The
wrong that has been done should be impressed upon
Congress at the present session. As the matter
stands, if Congress does not take some action to
amend the law and do justice to the small dealers,
there will be some suspicion that the big cigar fac
tories have cunningly devised this scheme to drive
their small competitors out of business and compel
them to seek employment in the big factories as
operatives, and possibly at lower wages than the pres
ent operatives are earning.
The cigar-makers should not be left to fight the
battle alone. The issue is one that concerns the
whole community. It is estimated there are upward
of 2000 cigar-makers in this city alone, and that there
are dependent upon them something like three times
that number. The ruin of the industry out of which
is derived the maintenance of that number of persons
would be a serious affair under any circumstances,
even if brought about by -the irresistible development
of forces of economic change, but when done by an
act of legislation it is an injustice which should not
tolerated a day after its effects have been noted.
THE ELECTION OF SENATORS.
WITH the return of the season of Senatorial
elections there has come a renewed demand on
the part of intelligent and patriotic citizens
for an amendment to the constitution providing that
such elections shall be held by direct vote of the peo
ple instead of by Legislatures.
The demand is not only renewed, but is augmented
in force. At each successive period the scandal of
Senatorial struggles becomes worse and the need of
change more distinctly perceived. The advocates of
the desired reform increase in numbers and in the
energy of their efforts to bring it about. Sooner or
later such an amendment must be provided in the
general interests of the country, and the sooner it is
adopted the better.
Bad as are the open and notorious evils that lie on
the surface of Senatorial struggles in the Legisla
tures, these are by no means the greatest wrongs pro
duced by the present system of election. Back of
them are other offenses which affect all the legislation
of the session at which such elections are held, and
materially vitiate and corrupt the whole political de
velopment of the State.
The scandals that are more readily perceived and
exposed are those of bribery, either by defraying the
election expenses of a candidate for the Legislature
or by the distribution of money afterward. Such
ofienses are serious enough, since they enable cor
rupt men to advance to high office and prevent hon
esty and merit from attaining the honors they de
serve, but their evil terminates, however, with the
election of the vicious candidate, while there are
other offenses that go further.
Corruption, in working its snaky way to high
office, rarely resorts to the purchase of votes by
money. . It uses such bribes only for the lower grade
of rascals who are in politics solely for boodle. It has
more powerful inducements or compulsions to bring
to bear upon the better grade of legislators, and it is
by these it inflicts the greater, more far-reaching and
more enduring wrongs upon the State and the people.
One of these indirect means of winning votes is
that of patronage. For the purpose of promoting
the candidacy of a corrupt man his allies in office dis
tribute the patronage of the State among those who
will support him. Men who are utterly unfit to be
intrusted with public service, and often those who
are notoriously vicious and dishonest, are given im
portant positions because they have influence with
some member of the Legislature and can control his
vote for Senator. Frequently new offices are created
for the purpose of increasing this patronage, and the
taxpayers are thus burdened not only with incom
petent and base office-holders, but with a considerable
number who render no service whatever.
Another means is that of offering to furnish votes
for certain measures on condition that the advocates
of the measures will vote for the Senator to whom the
offered votes are pledged. Such combinations are so
frequently made it often happens that the legislation
of a whoje session is determined by the wire-pulling
and log-rolling of the Senatorial contest.
The evil? of these elections are, in fact, so far
reaching they affect the interests of every class of
people and legislation of all kinds. Such offenses, in
creasing with the years, have now become intolerable.
It is time to put an end to them. Under the present
system, to attain a Scnatorship a candidate must
either have great wealth or be backed by corporations
that supply him with wealth. Let us revive the
spirit of the constitution by amending the letter, and
once more make the avenues to the Senate open to
integrity, ability and patriotism, so that the welfare of
the State may be preserved and "corruption win not
more than honesty."
When a man is detected leaving a ship and wrapped
ir forty yards of silk there is almost warrant for be
lief that he is engaged in smuggling. Possibly, how
ever, the Mallaby jury was prejudiced against cir
cumstantial evidence.
One way to weaken that depressing deadlock would
be for some of the little candidates to drop out. The
difficulty, however, would be to find any candidate
who would consider himself in this classification.
Noble efforts to save the charter continue. As
the charter is not in danger, and really has no op
position, these efforts may be regarded as spectacular
rather than useful.
The best case of well-directed economy afforded by
any Legislature this winter is that of Tennessee. The

Vicious Criticisms of
Colonel Smith.
THEY WERE ANONYMOUS
LIBELS OF A DISGRACEL CORPO
RAL GIVEN HEARING.
Without Question or Verification
They Were Published and Cir
culated â Warren's Det^nse
of His Commander.
The publication in an evening paper of
a letter purported to have been signed by
"A Member of Company II," in which
certain statements reflecting on the offi
cers of the First California Volunteers
and Colonel James F. Smith In particu
lar, lias aroused the friends of Colonel
Smith to a deep sense of the grievous in
justice done him and has called forth a
storm of protects against statements
which are branded as false and malicious.
Frank 11. Warren, captain of Company
11, who returned yesterday morning from
Sacramento, where he has made earnest
efforts to have the Legislature memorial
ize Congress to bring the First California
home, was highly indignant when shown
the article, and he expressed himself in
strong terms against the perpetrator of
the outrage. Captain Warren was inti
mately associated with Colonel Smith up
to the time he left Manila pending
the acceptance of his resignation from the
service, which came Tuesday by tele
graph. After reading the aspersions
against his superior officer Captain War
ren said:
"I think I know the author of the
anonymous communication. It is one of
two corporals of my company who were
reduced to the ranks and sentenced to
thirty days in the guard house for ab
senting themselves without leave for
I three days. It is a mean exhibition of
spltework on the part of a disgruntled
individual and I am astounded that any
I newspaper should have printed the seur-
I rllous letter without having first verified
the allegations contained therein.
"Any one who is acquainted with Colo
nel Smith's feelings in the matter will
recognize at once that he never declared
that the boys were in no hurry to return
I home. Colonel Smith was as anxious to
| return home as any one In the regiment.
i What he did say was that if the Govern
ment thought that tho services of the reg
iment were required in Manila he, as well
as the men tinder him, were ready and
j willing to remain and perform those ser
vices. These are the exact feelings of
all the men. It is not a fact that the
lxiys from California arc sick and dis
gusted with the whole outfit. The ra
tions are good and their quarters the
j best in Manila. In my quarters there was
| room for thirty more men. Each man had
J a cot and a mosquito net attached there-
I to.
"In regard to Colonpl Smith's political
: aspirations I can safely say that he has
I none, and it is not redounding to his
[financial benefit to remain where he is.
I He could make more money by returning
i to his law practice in this city, which
i ha? suffered on account of his absence.
"I consider this unwarranted attack
I upon a man who has done so much for
! the men of the California regiment as
wicked and unwarranted. Ask any man
in the regiment and he will tell you that
Colonel Smith ha? been unremitting in
: his attentions to the comfort of those un
j der him.
"In recommending him for brigadier
general of volunteers Major General
Thomas Anderson commends him for his
bravery and efficiency. 'He has com
; manded a brigade.' writes Anderson 'with
such excellent conduct and judgment as ;
j makes it evident that he deserves ad
vancement.'
"Major General Otis added his meed of
praise by writing that 'Colonel Smith is
a zealous officer, good soldier, as well as
lawyer, and as president of tho commis
sion here is rendering most valuable ser
vice to the Government. ' Smith always
said that he preferred to remain plain
colonel, and how any one could have the
heart to vilify him is beyond my ken.
"In regard to the officers always get
ting the best of it all I can say is that
if they did they wore obliged to pay for
it. In the matter of riding around in car
riages the privates themselves were not
far behind in the enjoyment of that lux
ury. Very often if the officers desired to
take a ride they found it impossible to
gratify their desire on account of the
open victorias being already hired by the
privates, who rode up and down the prin
cipal street, called the "Escolta," in |
many cases the vehicle containing only
two men with their feet perched Up on
the other seat.
"I deep.ly deplore the unkind things
said about Colonel Smith and I emphat
ically deny that he ever wrote or cave
utterance to the remarks that have been
ascribed to him by a disaffected member
of my company."

No Stop, No Charter.
The following letter, received yesterday
by the secretary of the Railroad Commis
sioners in this city, explains itself:
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 15, 1599.
To the Railroad Commissioners, State of Cali
fornia: I have a complaint to make against
the Southern Pacific Railroad Company for vio
lation of the law of this State. On November
15, 1889, 1 flagged the southbound â  train at
Honby, due about 5:45 a. m., for Los Angeles,
and the engineer refused . to stop. Honby is a
Bag station on said road, located about thirty
seven miles north of Los Angeles.' It is always
the rule to stop at this station on flagging, .and
besides, having purchased a ticket at that
point, it was their duty to haul me back.
I made complaint at the offices In Los An
geles and was referred to the division super
intendent at Bakernfleld. I wrote to him In
forming him of the- same, and no attention
was paid to it. Therefore your petitioner prays
that the commissioner* investigate these
charges, and if proved to be true that the
Southern Pacific Railroad Company forfeit their
charter to the State. Very respectfully,
l-\ .T. PATTERSON',
1026 West Twenty-fifth street.

NOTED iitEN AT THE TRAPS.
Tod Sloane and Johnny Coleman Will
Shoot a 100-Bird Race To-Day.
"I have made my fortune In the saddle,
but of all sports I think nothing is more
enjoyable than shooting," said Tod Sloan
last evening to his friend Johnny Cole
tnan, who, by the way, is a smasher at
the traps.
"Can you really shoot. Tod?" queried
Coloman in a rather astonished tone.
Sloan did not speak for fully five min
utes. He felt stung at being asked such
a stupid question, but finally he mustered
up sufficient courage to put one to Cole
man.
"Look here, Johnny, me boy, if you
have an idea that I can't shoot I'll just
bet you a champagne supper that I can
drop more birds any day before the traps
than you have ever been known to kill.
Coleman was staggered.
The presumption of the little man of
pig skin fame challenging him to a pig
eon shoot, and live birds at that, was
something unforeseen, unexpected, un
thought of: but Tod meant every word
he said, and Coleman had to accept the
challenge or de the laughing stock of the
gun shooting fraternity.
"Well, Tod. old boy. I guess I must ac
commodate ynu.notwithstandingthat you
are reported' to have bagged more grouse
than the Prince of "Wales on the Scot
tish moors in a day's sport." was the
smiling retort of Bookmaker Jack.
The two crackajacks then repaired to
the rooms of the Olywpie Gun Club, wher?
articles of agreement wore drawn up and
signed by the shooters to meet this after
noon at the shooting grounds of the
Olympic Gun Club and shoot at 100 bird?
each for the supper. Hurlingham rules
will govern the race and thp articles
ended up with the statement. "May the
best man win." Al dimming will act as
second for Sloan and Sloan will be es
qulted by Eddie Bald, the wheelman.
Referee and official scorers will be select
ed on the grounds. Coleman is a slight
favorite in tli>- betting, but it is though:
that the friends of Sloan will open up
their sacks to-day.

ment.
The Orpheum has never before been as
crowded as it was yesterday afternoon at
the matinee given by the management for
the benefit of the Children's Hospital.
After the doors were opened at 1 o'clock
the house was half filled in an incredibly
short time, and at 1:30 standing room only
waa procurable.
As to the artist who took part, the
same motive which brought 2000 people to
the show impelled the vaudeville folks to
surpass themselves in the exhibition of
| their marvelous talents.
Miss Bee Ross appeared in addition to
the regular programme and proved her
| self a dainty and clever interpreter of
coon songs.
The receipts amounted to $977 85. The
programmes and proceeds of advertising
! were donated by Horwinskl Brothers, and
I the flowers by Shannahan, the Powell

The flower girls who helped swell the
receipts by their engaging manners were

A NOBMAL SCHOOL PLAN.
Pupils Willing to Contribute to a
Fund to Maintain It.
A meeting of the Normal School stu
dents was held yesterday afternoon. The
young ladies agreed upon a plan of pay-
Ing their own tuition to the school, and
will submit their determination to the
Board of Education at its next meeting.
Each pupil proposes to contribute $5 per
month to the general school fund, and in
tend by so doing to break the econom
ical objection which has been brought to
bear against the existence of the institu
tion. By placing the money in the gen
eral school fund it cannot be construed
as being an appropriation to maintain an
independent school.
A petition is being circulated and has
already gained the signatures of over 1000
residents of this city urging that the Nor
mal School be continued until the end of
June. It sets forth that the pupils en
tered the school at the beginning of the
term with the intention of graduating,
and should not be robbed of this opor
tunitv.
A mass-meeting will be held in Depart
ment 6 of the Superior Court in the City
Hall for the purpose of protesting against
the action of the School Board. The par
ents of the pupils and the public are in
vited to be present.

SUTRO'S HEIRS

HIS WEALTH
Trust Clause Declared
Null and Void.
JUDGE TROUTT'S DECISION
BASED ON THAT GIVEN IN THE
FAIR CASE.
"A Trust to Convey Is Invalid and
Besides the Intent of the Tes
tator Is Not Clearly-
Defined."
Yesterday morning Judge Troutt deÂ«
dared the trust clause nf the will of
Adolph Sutro invalid, and in the event
the Supreme Court sustains the opinion,
or the decision rendered by Judge Slack
declaring a similar trust in the will of
the late James G. Fair invalid, the Sutro
Heights, CHtf Hmise and San Miguel
Rancho properties, valued at about $3,000,
--000, will be merged in the residuary estate
of the dead millionaire and will be distrib
uted among the hHrs at law to the vast
estate as though the deceased had died in
testate.
The trust clause was declared Invalid
in the action instituted by Clara Sutro,
Edgar E. Sutro, Kate Nusbaum and Rosa
V. Morbio. children of Adolph Sutro,
against Mrs. I>r. Emma L. Merritt and
W. H. R. Adamson, as trustees, and
Emma L. Merritt, her husband, George
W Merritt, and Charles Sutro. Judge
Troutt in deciding the case simply or
dered that judgment be entered for tne
plaintiffs. He filed no opinion, but stated
that judgment was given in accordance
with the decision handed down in the ac
tion to declare the trust clause, of the
will of the late James G. Fair invalid.
"The clause is clearly invalid, sairt Judge
Troutt after he left the bench, ''by rea
son that it endeavors to establish a trust
to convey. Again, it is ambiguous in .hat
the intent of the testator is not clearly
defined, and it is doubtful hat with the
limited directions of the will of the dp
ceased it could be determined and carried
after the decision was ren
dered a stipulation was filed in the pro
bate department of the County Clerk s of
fice dismissing the contest of t-dgar E.
Sutro to the Will. This leaves the way
clear for the probating of the will unless
Mrs Clara Kiuge, who claims igat her
children are also those of the deceased
capitalist, files a content and demanrts
that the paternity of her children bt s de
clared by the court, and that they be al
lowed to enjoy the fruits of Sutro s years
of toil.
ANOTHER WAR ON THE
EDUCATIONAL SOCIETY
Chinese Slave Owners Begin - Fight
Similar to the Cne Lost a
Year Ago.
The trial of Ong Foon, arrested on the
charges of vagrancy and attempted ex
tortion and blackmail, which comes he
fore Judge Mogan this afternoon, is one
in which there is much interest in China
town.
For several years the Chinese Society
for English Education has been a strong
factor in the suppression of slave dealing
and illicit immigration, and the result has
been that the slave dealers' association
has used every means in its power to
break up the society.
About a year ago these attacks on the
society were fully exposed in The Call,
and it was then shown that thousands of
dollars had been raised among the keep
ers and inmates of the houses of ill fame
in Chinatown for the purpose of suborn
ing witnesses in order to break up the
Educational Society.
Ong Foon is an active member of the
Educational Society and has been instru
mental in numerous cases in sending
back to China women who were brought
here as slaves. The slave dealers and
owners have had him arrested on the
charges set forth above and expect to
strike through him the first blow of an
other attack on the society. Foon claims
to be able to fully disprove all the
charges against him. and the society is
ready to take immediate action for its
protection as soon as the case is decided.
At the time of the former attack it was
conclusively shown by the police that the
Educational Society w r as the only society
in Chinatown which never gave trouble,
and durir.pr the existence of the organiza
tion no member had bctn arrested on any
charge, and at no time of the day or night
had the police ever found the door of tha
society's rooms locked.
An investigation into the conditions
surrounding the present fight shows that
another fund has been raised by the slave
dealers, but the society expresses confi
dence in its ability to meet all charges
and attacks that may be made upon it.

he realizes that the chances are about
five to one against him.
long ago Mr. Halo, who has ftll
along professed to be heartily tired of
the onerous duties devolving upon the
warden of a State Prison, learned to his
surprise and extreme displeasure that
'â¢overnor Gage had virtually selected
his successor in the person of Martin
Agguire of I,oÂ« Angeles, a former
Sheriff of that city. Ever since then
his friends have been at work trying
to change the tide of affairs, but with
little apparent success. So now Mr.
Kale poos tÂ« r Sacramento to gee what
the effect of h's personal magnetism
wttl be
The real reason why Warden Hale
Is said to be in disfavor with the lead-
Ing political lights is that when asked
to make a subscription to the State
Central Committee he sent a check for
only $50. A member advised that this
be returned, but it was not, and now
the warden has a dose of medicine not
to his liking prepared.
AN UNKNOWN SUICIDE.
Believed to Be Mrs. Kaelber of Mar
tinez, Contra Costa County.
A woman about 35 years old, supposed
to be Mrs. Kaelber, committed suicide
last Tuesday night by taking half the
contents of a six-ounce bottle of carbolic
acid. She engaged a room last Monday
in the Carroll House, 124 Sixth street. She
represented that she was a stranger and
that she wanted employment. Mrs. Shee
han, the landlady, got her some washing
to do for yesterday, but when the lodger
was called she failed to respond. The
door of her room was tightly locked, and
the windows &nd the transom over the
door were shut. The door was broken In
and the dead body of the unfortunate
woman was seen lying on the bed. The
half-empty bottle of carbolic acid lying
on the bureau at the head of the bed told
the rest of the story."
Among her effects was found the fol
lowing letter addressed to Mrs. Kaelber
at Martinez:
RAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 80. IS9S.
Dear Friend Mrs. Kaelber: I will drop you
a few lines to let you know that 1 saw Mrs.
Cunningham on Sixth street last night, and
she told me to write to you and tell you that
the â !â ;. Is very sick Just now, and she wishes
you would come down to the city as soon as
you can. Yours respectfully. nKMtV.
The body was removed to the Morgue
: and an inquest will be held this morning.

Ended Her Misery.
Miss Jennie Carter, vi years of age, who
lived with her brother at 1036 Filbert
street, died yesterday morning- from the
effects of a dose of rat poison taken last
Sunday with suicidal intent. For some
time past Miss Carter has been suffering
with an abcess in the head. Last Sunday
she was taken violently ill. and on being
tpn stioned told her relatives that she had
taken poison to end her misery. A physi
cian was called In who did all in his
power to relieve her sufferings, but
was too late, and after three days of in
tense agony she died at 11 o'clock yester
day. Coroner Hill was notified and gave
a permit for burial.

FREE FIGHT IN A SALOON.
Three Men and Two Women Arrested
and One Man in the Hospital.
There was a frp<* fight in A. Becker's
saloon. 25 Turk street, about 4 o'clock j
yesterday morning:, and three men and
two women were arrested, while another ;
man was takf-n to the Receiving Eiospltal, !
whrre two lacerated wounds in his scalp
were stitchrd and dressed.
J. Howard, 324 Golden Gate avenue, and
a friend went into the saloon to have a
drink. Howard showed a gold coin which
ho said was valued at $40, and a woman
named Am;io Adams, be Bays, snatched it
out of his hand. He left the saloon and

for grand larceny, Bernard for assault
with a deadly weapon. Eugene Fox and
Joseph Eades for battery and vagrancy
and Mamie Johnston for vagrancy.
The cases were assigned to Judge Mo
pan's court and the Judge took occasion
to say that he was amazed that the Po
lice commissioners should issue a license
to Becker. "The man," said the Judge,
"is a notorious straw bondsman and is
constantly hanging around the police
courts. 1 have notified the bond expert
not to allow his name to be on any bonds,
and why he should be permitted to run a
saloon Is beyond my understanding."
The cases were continued and the Judge
fixed tho bonds of the Adams woman and
Bernard at $2000 each.
EXHUMED THE BODY
OF MRS. SLINKEY
THOROUGH CHEMICAL ANALY
SIS WILL BE MADE.
The General Opinion Is That Mrs.
Slinkey Ended Her Own Life
by Hanging.
Quite an army of medical talent gath
ered nt Laurel Hill Cemetery yesterday
afternoon for the disinterment of the
body "f Mrs. James E. Silnkey, found last
Friday hanging in a closet at her home,
110 Ellis street.
Coroner Edmund E. Hill, acting on the
anonymous letter whirh he received last
Sunday, and In which the writer, who
Bigna him or herself. "A Friend," claims
that Mrs. Slinkey met her death by foul
means, headed the corps of physicians
who were present and directed the oper
ations. Besides Dr. Hill there were. Dr.
Zabala, autopsy physician; Dr. E. S.
Howard, professor of anatomy at the Col
lege of Physicians; ex-Coroner Hughes,
Dr. Torney; James E. Slinkey. the hus
band of the deceased; T. J. Crowley, his
attorney, and Detective Dillon, who is
working on the case.
The body Â»as exhumed and removed to
the receiving vault, where the physicians
collected for the dissection. Mr. Slinkey
ed upon the remains of his wife just
before the autopsy and seemed much af
fected. The heart, stomach and bladder
were removed from the body: pieces of
one lung, the liver, spleen and intestines
were afeo taken. A chemical analysis
will be made by L. S. Crackbon at once
for the purpose of discovering any
traces uf poisoning, should they exist. In
this he will ho assisted by Dr. Hill, who
is much interested in the "outcome of the
examination.
All the physicians who were present at
the autopsy yesterday are unanimous in
the opinion that Mrs. Slinkey met her
death from strangulation. All the exter
nal indications, they claim, point to tht-;
mode of life's exit. According to their
examination yesterday afternoon, there
are no external indications of poisoning.
Until a chemical analysis of the detached
organs is made nothing positive c:m be
determined as to the internal indications
of poisoning. The result of this analysis
will not lie known until Friday.
The husband of the dead woman called
on the Coroner again this morning an. 1 ,
he courts the fullest investigation of the
death of his wife. He said she had been
ring from melancholia and mental
depression for some time prior to her
death. A few days before her body was
found slii .<sk< d her physician if death
from strangulation was attended with
greai physical sufferine.
The Coroner and assisting physicians
are prune to believe that the anonymous
writer has played them a joke, yet they
will Investigate the matter fully.
Fortunes Made During th^ War.
A great number of people have made :
fortunes during the war by investing
in securities. In making these invest
ments it required large capital. But
fortunes were also obtained by the fol
lowing parties in return for investments
of sums of money so small they were j
never miÂ«sed. F. Vette. grocer, north
west corner Jones and O'Farrell streets,
San Francisco. Cal., purchased a $1
ticket in the lottery of the Beneficen
oia Publics Company of the City of
Mexico, for which he received $15,000.
Another fortunate -narty was Mr. S.
Cahn. 12?> Montgomery street, San !
Francisco, Cal.. who invested only 50 j
cents and received $1250. The above
amounts were promptly paid at the of
flee of Metzger & Franklin, 35 New
Montgomery street, San Francisco, Cal.
The Lottery of the Beneficencia Pub
lica Company of the City of Mexico is
popular on this coast for the reason j
that so many l.rge prizes have been I
won here. The public is guaranteed j
an hor.est drawing and prompt pay
ment of prize.;, as all drawings are held
in public under the immediate super
vision of the Government, which ap
points Senator Apolinr Castillo Inter
venor, and Antonio Perez for the Treas
ury Department. The old reliable Lot
tery of the H^nefireneia Publiea Com
pany of the City of Mexico, of which
V. Bassetti is manager, is the only lot

On Tuesday, Myth, the despised out

cap at Ingleside, turned up winner, and
yesterday the odd one won again. It
all happened in the Balboa Boulevard
; Stake for three-year-olds over a mile.
Corsine, the ftiley colt, sporting the col
ors of Ed Corrigan, was the pick of the
smart set, closing at 9 to 10 favorite.
I Survivor, the entry of Pnt Dunne, had
, many admirers who took 7 to 5. while

Louis Ezell's old war horse. Kamsin.
scampered in winner of the opening
i event, at odds of 15 and 20 to 1. Rutter
! had the leg up, and led Torsion out by
four lengths. George H. Ketcham. the
! favorite, made a, very poor showing,
i being unable to keep up any part of the
! running.
For the first time in many moons
: Elidad had a rider on his back, and the
mile selling run was only a gallop for
i him. Ruling favorite, Martin at once
i took him to the front, when the barrier
1 was released, and won with ease from
; Frank Jaubert. Ping finished in the
; show.
The mile ar.d a quarter hurdle handi
', cap was the best one of these affairs
â  yet witnessed. Of the ten starters.
I Major S was the only one to fall. Tak
â  ing the lead in the stretch. Viklne. the
second choice, fought It out with Ross
i more, finally winning in a drive by half
1 a length. Octuruck, the favorite, was
â  third.
Favored by the conditions, the five
furlong scramble, fifth to be decided,
proved another windfall for Ach. Go
ing to the post favorite, be issued from
the fog in front, and crossed the wire
a very easy winner over Sir Urian. A
long price was laid against Casdale. and
his showing fully justified the odds.
Sombre, the jaunty black filly, proved
no match for Rubicon in the final five
furlong dash. The latter was an even
money choice, and won eased up. Som
bre led Novia over the. line half a
length.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. IS.â The stock market, ex- I
rojt for initial heaviness in sympathy with
London, which in turn reflected the weakness
of New York closing yesterday, made a prac
tically uninterrupted course upward. The gains I
â¢were fractional in the general market, while ;
the Grangers and minor specialties made sub
-itahtlal advances. Investment purchases were
..â¢â¢â very heavy and largely concentrated in the j
'..Grangers. Early efforts to cause a continu
ance of yesterday's reaction lasted but a short !
'.time, as there was no evidence of Important j
â¢ "liquidation and London sales of some 23,000 .
. : 'chares were well absorbed. Commission house !
laying was renewed and the shorts were forced
â¢to -cover in a number of stocks. The market
was comparatively dull in the forenoon and
.then gradually increased in activity and
strength up to the close. The feeling In Lon
â¢ don improved and there were some repurchases
Of stock for that quarter. St. Paul's increase
'â 'of- $144,000 gross for the second week in January
" Inspired more confidence in that group of stocks
and there was an increase of western orders
â  to- buy, compared with those of the last day
or .two, which had diminished. The possibility
that .Burlington might presently refund some
of- its bonds on a lower basis, thus benefiting ]
.Jh'- stock, was much discussed, and Burling
-.ton rose over live points. It was learned that
:â  no action was taken by the Burlington dlrec
.tors in Boston I -day. Omaha rose in expec
tation of the declaration of an extra dividend
. .at to-morrow's meeting of the directors, and
' Northwestern! cause of the benefit of which
action should accrue to it, advanced 3% points.
â  Traders, seeing the support extended to the
â¢ market, successfully bid up prices whenever
â¢ .opportunity offered. Sometimes it was Federal
Steel, other times Sugar or Manhattan. Cen
tral Pacific developed strength on the report
.that the reorganization plan was- practically
â  completed. The volume of business, while
. greater than that of yesterday, lacked over
â¢. liO.OOO of reaching the million-share mark.
There was a number of important, move- |
ments in the bond trading to-day, conspicuous
among which was a rise of 8% in Fulton Ele- ''
vated fives and four points In Burlington con
vertibles. The general market showed decided
â¢etrength all around. Total sa.es. $3,105,000.
â¢ Government bonds closed unchanged for all
Issues.

LONDON MARKETS.
NEW YORK, Jan. IS.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business on the markets here was reduced to
day, but the tone was hard on the confident
expectation that the bank rate will be reduced
to-morrow to 3 per cent. Americans were dull
early but steady on realizing except in Central
Pacifies, which were again bought on rumors
that the reorganization plan is ready. New
York came strong, causing a sharp rally, and
the close was at the best, especially in Atchi
son and Wabash Issues. The latter" s rise sug
gests here the comment that the boom lias
reached the end of the alphabet. London en
thusiasm Is much diminished.
Coppers were buoyant. Tlntos were 34%. the

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
'
CHICAGO, Jan. IS.â Several commission peo
ple who had selling orders of a pressing char
acter executed them on the curb before the
opening, and that, together with lower cables
from Liverpool and the Continent, gave wheat
a weak send-off. May opened M<B%c lower at
70@70%c, but there was a great deal of wheat
wanted at the decline and the market ' be
came firm with a slightly upward tendency
during the first hour. Receipts here and In the
Northwest were sufficiently moderate to favor
the bulls rather than the bears, and early In
dications were for a heavy total of seaboard
clearances of wheat and flour. Yesterday's
revelation In the case of Russian shipments
was still In the minds of the traders, however,
which prevented any enthusiastic buying, and
the market ruled rather dull, with May hang
ing around 70-% c.
Bradstreet's statement of the world's visi
ble supply made it 1,562,000 bushels more than it
was a week ago, compared with a reduction of
1 1,000 bushels the same week of last year.
After temporary decline to 70% c, to where May.'
had slowly climbed, the short-lived weakness
being Induced by Bradstreet's statement, tpe
market became comparatively strong. May
reaching 70% c about twenty miutes from ithe
close. At that price a demand sprang up from
traders who had calls sold, and May rose to
70"sÂ®71c, and closed at 70% c. i
Corn was easy and a shade lower to start
v.-Ith, but the demand was good at the decline
and the firmness that developed in wheat
helped corn to maintain Itself against absence
of shipping demand. May closed %@'ic higher.
Selling by a prominent elevator concern
weakened oats early. After this lot was dis
posed of the offerings became light and after
the other markets became stronger the demand
Improved, resulting in a sharp advance. May
closed %@'.;c higher. -
Higher prices for hogs and heavy shipments
of meats started provisions strong. There was
a lot of selling early, however, and as the de
mand was scattered, prices eased off. As soon
as the grain market began to show evidence
of strength this was all changed and buying
became animated, resulting in an advance all
around. May pork closed 7%c higher. The

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, Jan. 18.â American "Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
While the wool markets have been quieter
during the past week than for a long time,
they have not been without some interesting
features. One of the most important of these
is the pronounced inquiry for wools grading
one-quarter, three-eighths and one-half blood,
and this inquiry has extended to both domestic
and foreign stocks of this description, Aus
tralian crossbreds in particular having been
well sought for and firm in price. In fact,
these wools are quoted fully a cent per pound
higher than they were o manth ago. Cross
breds had been depressed disproportionately in
comparison with merinos.
In pulled wools there is a firmer feeling,
especially on "B's" and combings, and the
same may be said about carpet wools, which
the buyers have shown more disposition to pur
chase.
THe sales Of thÂ» week in the Boston market
amounted to 2,247,500 pounds domestic and
435.000 pounds foreign, making a total of 2,686, -
MX), against a total of 3,210,500 for the previous
week and a total of 377,000 for the correspond
ing week last year. Since January 1, 1599, sales
amounted to 9,692,000 pounds, against 14,335,000
pounds last year at this time.

STORM DEALT
WITH THE SHIPS
Rush for Coal From
Belated Colliers.
SAUSALITO YACHTS SUFFERED
STRIKE OF LONGSHOREMEN ON
THE WRECKED NOYO.
Arrival of the British Ship Wallace
' town â She Was Compelled to
Put Into Coqulmbo in
Distress.
The storm Is over, but tales from ves
.sels that suffered In it will continue to
come In for some time. All the
-..'vessels in port took advantage of the sun
shins yesterday and had their sails out
to dry- A big fleet of fishing boats went
but for the first time in weeks and they
arid the sailors at work on the ships at
anchor gave an appearance of life to
:th.e bay that it has not had for two
.wi-eeks.
. Tho arrival of the overdue colliers made
: ;.thlng3 lively on the front and long strings
;t>f wagons were waiting at each of the
bunkers for a chance to load. The Wel
lington got in from Departure Bay late
Tuesday afternoon, and some of the coal
wagons were in line all night waiting to
get the first load in the morning. The
Charles Nelson came in from Seattle.
Her delay was dua to the fact that her
captain did not like the looks of the
weather, so he lay for a day and a night
in Jseah Bay. The Mlneola from Seattle
and the Wyefield from Nanlamo, B. C,
were seven days coming down, and they
goj tho full benefit of the storm. They
were hove to for thirty-six hours and had
a very rough time of it.
Over at Sausallto the yachtsmen and
others are repairing the damage done by
the southeaster. The San Francisco Yacht
Club's float got loose and drifted down
on Dr. McKenzie's gasoline launch Al
berta. The latter was driven on the
beach and had her bottom considerably
damaged. Later she drifted down on the
â yacht Ripple, and the Alberta had all
. her windows smashed while the Ripple
was badly chafed. The yacht Catherine
had her rudder broken, and a pleasure
boat owned by Mr. Susaville was stove
in by the derelict float. Six feet of the
embankment around the Pacific Yacht
Club's boathouse was carried away, and
the waves made a clean breach through
the building. All the earthworks around
the house were carried away and the
are now stands alone in its glory
in the middle of a lake.
The wrecked steamer Noyo has been
ilncked at Little Main street and the work
nloafllng her is being rushed. Tues
day night J. H. Bullock of Kimball &
got a lot of longshoremen together
and set them to work at unloading the
Tho men soon learned that it was
"a rush job" and demanded 50 cents an
hour instead of the regular 30 cents. Mr.
Bullock had to pay it, but yesterday
morning when he had the crew to
gether he ordered them to turn to. Then
the- crew said they wouldn't work for less
than 50 cents an hour. The matter was
laid before the Shipowners' Association,
but It was powerless, so Mr. Bullock
went back to the Noyo and put the long- j
shoremen to work again. At the same :
time he told the sailors that all the over
time and overpay that the longshoremen '
'were receiving would be stopped out of ;
their pay. At 1 p. m. this brought the i
- to their tenses and they turned to, i

SCALING JULIET'S LADDER
TAUGHT HIM PORCH-CLIMBING
grand opera prima donna, reposes in
his prison cell.
In spite of the wondrous taJent Si
monsen, alias James Stewart, the
porch-climbing burglar, has displayed
for his nefarious calling, the man is
first and foremost an actor, and his
gift of the dramatic makes even his
startling thieving propensities pale
into the insignificant. Prison life Is
distasteful to the tenor burglar only
because a jail menu is harmful to the
proper production of clear, sweet notes
and the damp, cold cell is only disa
greeable in the direct ratio that it is
harmful to sensitive vocal chords.
The singing porch-climber fits easily
into the groove of prison life. As yet
he has given no sample of his allur
ing "ahâ ahing" powers, cither to
jailer or inmates, although with tho
same emphasis that he declares his
innocence he protests against the slan
der that he has lost his voice.
"My voice is now stronger and bet
ter than ever," he repeats again and
again, as he dramatically tells his
very fishy theatrical tale that he sup
Drank Carbolic Acid.
Mrs. Gertrude Johnson, who conducts
a shooting gallery at 418 Dupont street,
drank a Quantity of carbolic acid last
night with .suicidal intent, and her death
will probably be the result. About 11
o'clock the woman went out and procured
tin* acid. Returning to the house she
poured the contents of the bottle into a
glasp, but had gulped down but a portion
of it when the glass was wrenched from
her hand by her daughter, Loretta. aged
14 years. She was immediately taken to
the Receiving Hospital, but her condi
tion is very serious and Dr. Morrison,
under whoso treatment she h;uÂ« bron
placed, has given up hope of saving her
llff*. Despondency is said to have been
the cause of her act.

poses Is going to clear him of the
many charges that are booked against
htm.
It is a tale of noble heroism, with a
dash of hunger and want: a trusting,
unsophisticated hero and an unknown
heroine, for whom the tenor would
rather take a twenty years' sentence
than to reveal her name.
"The Cafe Royal was my undoing,"
explained Simonsen yesterday. "It
is infested by a band of thieves. I was
a stranger in the city. I went up there
and naturally fell In with the people
who frequent the place. I met some
fellows there to whom I advanced
small sums of money, and the articles
they gave me for security it has since
transpired were stolen.
"The jewels the detectives found in
my trunk were given me, by a woman
to pawn for her. She has since left
town and I was awaiting her present
address before carrying out her in
structions. The detectives â those
hounds of the so-called lawâ have
urged me to tell the woman's name.
Never: Rather than have her submit
to the outrages I have been obliged to
submit myself to I would serve, twenty
years. Any way, I am not the kind
or man that tells a woman's nafne."
Simonsen tells his story prettily. He
draws his slight nervous figure 'to its
full ht-ight at the inspiring sacrificing
part, and his baby-blue trusting eyes
fill with tears when he refers to his
misfortune in falling in with the ques
tionable company of the Cafe Royal.
Stoutly the tenor maintains that "the
porch climbing of the Heyman resi
dence that resulted in his arrest is his
very first offense.
"The open window was my tempta
tion, .said the prisoner. "1 was in
want. 1 had an engagement to go to
Seattle where T was to Â°P en Â°n the

GROCERS AS PURCHASERS.
The Association of Retailers Takes
Action That Will Affect
Local Conditions.
Grocery circles will be profoundly stir
red by the action of the Retail Grocers'
Association last night.
The new hoard of directors, after elect
ing- officers for the ensuing year, took a
stand that will tend to put the smallest
retailer in the city practically on a foot
ing with the largest firms. This was the
appointment of a 1 purchasing committee
consisting of six men, whose combined
purchases, together with the ability to
buy of the other stockholders of the or
ganization, will enable the Retail Grocers'
Association to contract for goods in
larger quantities than most of the other
wholesale houses.
Joseph A. Stulz and Supervisor John
Laekmann were elected president and
vice president respectively. The pur
chasing committee is to consist of Alex Ir
vine (5 stores), W. F. Harris (3 stores),
Andrew J. Knox (] stores), President Jo
seph A. Stulz (2 stores). E. I. Flioger (1
store) and Secretary John C. Nohmann.
Twelve new members were reported for
the past two weeks.
The pure food law was condemned. The
directors expressed their desire to see the
lawn enforced, but thought the State
should devote itself to manufacturers and
manufacturers' agents and leave retail
ers to the local authorities.-
A committee was appointed to act with
a similar committee from the Butchers'
Board of Trade to advance the amend
ments proposed to the debtor law.

Tenor Simonsen's j
Very Dramatic j
Story. j
IN a drese Phlrt, rumpled and rather H
the worse for wear, a tourist's <
jacket, an uncomely pair of trous-
ers and a startlingly unartistic pair
of brogans, Jules Simonsen, erst- (
while Tivoii favorite and brother to A
Madame Saville, the world renowned <
ment for several days. If a singer
Is not properly fed he is in no condi
tion to sing. I could not have my first
appearance in Seattle a disastrous
failure, so I made for that window,
intending with the booty to purchase
proper food."
Simonsen is very much aggrieved at
the officers of the law, who he says
are trying to get him to confess to
crime he never committed. "This is
my first and only offense," he says,
and with his dubious tale of the Cafe
Royal he tries to explain the stolen
articles and the pawn tickets for other
pilfered trifles found in his trunk.
Simonsen has sung with success in
Southern California, and also at the
Tivoii, where he recently appeared as
Renee, the tenor role in "Luzette."
The management at the Tivoii was
we m ll pleased with the porch-climbing
tenor. His voice was pleasant, his
appearance agreeable and his acting
light and easy. He only severed his
engagement at that houÃe because, the
holiday production of the "Yellow
Dwarf " found no part for him.
Madame Saville, the sister of 'he in
carcerated tenor, is one of the world's
famous song birds. As an artist she
ranks with Melba and has for many
years been a favorite in all the great
musical centers of the Old Worlrt.
Simonsen claims that be has ap
peared with success in all the stand
ard grand and comic operas, and con
fesses to a fondness for the role of
Romeo. Probably his agility in scal
ing Juliet's balcony gave him his first
hint in the direction of porch climb
ing.
Simonsen was yesterday held to an
swer before the Superior Court by
Judge Conlan In 12000 bonds on the
charge of burglary, for entering Hey
man s house Saturday night. The four
other charges against him were con
tinued until to-morrow.

Death of Professor Schmitz.
Professor Joseph L. Sehmitz. the well
known musician, expired in this city yes

to this coast in the days of '49 he was,
perhaps, the best known and one of the
highest esteemed. He wielded the baton
in many opera houses that are of the
past and guided the wavering notes of
almost every celebrity on the stage.
Among the old houses in which he had or
chestras were the Metropolitan Theater
on Montgomery, near Jackson, the Ma

and the American Theater on Sansome
street.

At the meeting of the Board of
Health last night Secretary J. J. I
Dwyer presented an extended report
showing how the expenses of the de
partment could be reduced $700 per
month without impairing the service.
There will be a deficit of $3000 in the
funds of the board at the end of its
term unless rigid economy is prac
ticed. He suggested that the board re
duce traveling and other expenses of
the various employes from $312 50 to
$162 50 per month, thus saving $150 in
that period. He thought the positions
of cigar factory inspector, laundry in
spector, bakery inspector and one gar
bage inspector should be abolished.
Their duties should be performed by
other officials of the department. Their
dismissal would mean a saving of $225.
He also suggested cutting The salary
of the veterinary surgeon from $150 to
$75. He would do away with the as
sistant vaccinator, saving another $50
per month. Finally he would reduce the
ten food inspectors to a force of six.
The total saving to the Health Depart
ment would be $700. Should these sug
gestions be adopted there would be no
deficiency. The matter was referred to
the Finance Committee.
Dr. Bazet suggested the location in
some convenient central place, near
the Receiving Hospital, of a munici
pal disinfecting station. It should
be open to the public free of charge.
It would be used to stop the spread of
infectious disease by sterilizing the
clothes, bedding, carpets and all
articles connected with infected pa
tients. Dr. Bazet also reported at
length upon the necessity of a steriliz
ing plant at the City and County Hos
pital.
The board recommended that the at
tention of the Supervisors be called to
the nuisance on the : Fair property
over at Black Point. It was sug
gested that they extend the sewers to
tide water.
Chemist Green of the board reported
that of fourteen samples of coffee ex
amined by him only two were pure.
The others were adulterated with chic
ory, flgseeds and cornhusks.
Attorney Burdette, representing Claus
Spreckels, appeared before the board
to protest against a nuisance and a
menace to health. This Is a meat pack
ing establishment that has been de
clared a nuisance by all who have been
brought in contact with it. Dr. Gallwey i
condemned it, saying it was a menace
to the health of persons living near by
and should be removed. Upon motion
of Dr. Fitzgibbon the proprietor was i
given one week in which to abate the
nuisance.
The meeting was not without its hu
mors. Dr. Hereford reported that the
appearance at the Pesthouse of a man
with variolold resulted in the employes
getting up and quitting. The disaf
fected employes were the cook and i
night watchman. The patient has not
suffered, as a special nurse was em
ployed, and Dr. Tlllman volunteered
also to take charge of the patient. For
this the board thanked him.
"*â  Dr. W. P. Agnew applied for the posi
tion as representative of the board at
the forthcoming six-day bicycle race.
This was referred to the committee on
Receiving Hospital, Dr. Williamson re
marking that was the Hace the men
would be most likely reach ultimately.
Matthew Kerr asked that a bottle of
medicine he purchased from a Market
street druggist be analyzed. It was for
distemper in dogs, and those doctored
with it died. The request was granted.
F. J. Corbett resigned his position of
inspector of garbage transportation.
The position of Leopold Popper, nipht
watchman at the Pesthouse, was de
clared vacant upon motion of Dr. Bazet.
C. A. Stafford, assistant chemist at
the City and County Hospital, resigned.
Superintendent Sussdorf, of the hos
pital, reported that he had to use the j
vestry and chapel in order. to isolate a
case of scarlet fever. His action was
approved.
Dr. John Gallwey. who has been act-
Ing Health Officer in the absence of Dr.
A. P. O'Brien, tendered his formal
resignation. Upon his retiring Mayor
Phelan thanked him for the splendid
services he had rendered the city dur
ing the past eight months.
Dr. O'Brien was escorted to his place
and welcomed by the Mayor, who said
that all were proud of him for the cood
he had done at the front. Dr. O'Brien
thanked the board for the reception ac
corded him. He al?o thanked Dr. Gall
wey, who, he said, had given a vast
amount of attention to the office and
had made a great sacrifice in aiding
him. He told of the boys of the gal
lant First Regiment at Manila, of their
general health and of their homesick
ness.

On certain went orn lands unless streams of living

the principle of life is carried throughout our

or broken down, the miseries that result are
BEYOND ALL TELLING. Lassitude and
debility, sleeplessness and dibcomfort, gloom,
fretfulness and incipient mania, lons of vita!
powers, and the tendency to consumption, and

Preacher Is Seriously
Charged.
ACCUSED OF GRAVE FRAUD
REVELATIONS EXPECTED IN
THE SANDERS WILL CASE.
Heir-at-Law Claims That William
Munce Used Undue Influence to
Gain Possession of Mrs.
Sanders' Estate.
Sensational dove-l'ipments are prom
ised in an action filed In the- Superior
Court yesterday by Attorney Charles L.
Patton, whereby Mrs. Martha Peterson
puos for the revocation of th 2 last will
and testament of the 'ale- Sarah J.
Sanders, who was familiarly known
(luring her lifetime as "the seamen's
friend." The testator died January 3,
1898, and on the 20th of the same month
her alleged will was admitted to pro
bate. I'nder the terms of the will,
which boars the dato of November 7.
1896, the chief beneficiary is William
WILLIAM MUNCE, the Ex- Mission -Worker,
Against Whom Serious Charges Are Made.
â¢ ; Munce, a mission-worker, who had for I
â  many years made his home in the San- 1
Â ders household. Mrs. Peterson, a niece
and solt- surviving relative of the testa- â 
; .t6r, was cut off with a paltry $100, while
-Munce was handsomely remembered in ,
'â¢'â '. a bequest of $4000; the remainder of the ;
'.. estate was left to William Munce and i
â Alb- rt Raymond, in trust, to be applied !
"to the support, maintenance and as- I
. '.'sistance of such seafaring men and Bea-
Btjen as may, in their Judgment, need : ,
â¢ -and deserve the same." 'â 
Mrs. Peterson charges that at the J
time th- will was executed Mrs. Sand- j i
*rs was in a weakened mental and pay- ;
sical condition; that William Munce | :
"wormed himself Into her confidence" j
i>y "falsely pretending to be a minister
of the gospel, and that he secured the ! |
execution of the will in his favor by â 
gross fraud." A very suspicious cir
cumstance in the premises is that the
â  insurance policy on the property of the
estate known as the . eamen's Home. ]
on liealÂ«- street, bears the â¢'X-inark" of .
Mrs. Sanders, and accompanying this
mark is the attest of a notary public
to the fact that "Mrs. Sarah J. Sanders
is ur.abli- i" read or write," while tho i
alleged will now in controversy con
tains the signature of the same Mrs,
Sanders in very legible handwriting:.
It Is fifteen years Bince AVUliam
' Munce arrived in this city from Chi
cago. According to his own story he
had been a captain on the great lakes,
but his vessel had gone down in a
Storm, and, harassed by ill-fortune, he
had finally come to this coast to try
â¢ and better his condition. Being in
hard straits he sought the Mariners' j
Church, and not only received aid, but
was soon employed to do mission work ;
among bay sailors.
Rev. J. Rowell, pastor of the Mari
ners' Church, corner of Sacramento and
Drumm streets, remembers well Mr.
Munce's advent. "Munce enlisted in
mission work under Rev. W. D.
Bishop," said the venerable minister
' last evening, "and was supported by i
subscriptions from church members. !
One of the most zealous members of !
our congregation at that time was Mrs.
Blisa J. Sanders, and, as the subscrip- j
tions for Munce's support were not very i
large the good old lady took him to '
board at her Seamen's Home on Beale I
street. Then trouble arose over the J
purchase of a boat for missionary work
and Munce's connection with the
church was severed. Rev. Mr. Bishop
warned Mrs. Sanders against Munce, j
but his warnings proved of no avail.
The old lady was not sound, either in <]
mind or body, for a number of years j
prior to her demise. Whenever I called
to see her Mr. Munce was invariably
present during the interview. He had
strong influence over Mrs. Sanders.
The old lady told me repeatedl* that
she had made provision for the\con
tinuance of gospel work among seamen
at the old home on Beale street."
When John Sanders died in 1882 he
left his widow, Sarah J., about $45,000
worth of property. To-day all that is
left to show for it is the Beale-street j
house, valued at from $7000 to $10,000. |
Mrs. Sanders was an economical lady,
nevertheless, although she had a kindly,
charitable heart. Munce managed the
old lady's property for thirteen years.
His room in the house was next to that
of Mrs. Sanders, with an ear-tube be
tween. Munce was paid, Mrs. Peterson
states, $5 for every meeting he held In
the house for the conversion of sailors.
He frequented the Peniel ?nd Salvation
Army missions and was well known
among them while Mrs. Sanders lived.
Since her death Munce has ceased ail
mission work. He no longer seeks the
conversion of sailors.
The Seamen's Home, Beale street,
well insured, took flre one midnight ol
last June, and only the very prompt
work of the Fire Department prevented
the complete destruction of the prop
erty. The circumstances pointed strong
ly toward incendiarism. Since that
time Peter Peterson, the husband of
the petitioner, has slept nightly in the
building. .
Last December all the furniture of
the Seamen's Home, saving the con
tents of one room, was sold at auction
by Munce, as trustee, and the house
th.it Mrs. Sanders hoped would be a
home for needy seamen is now a home
for no-body but Munce.
GRACE SYNDICATE
GIVEN A HEARING
Congressman McClure's Speech Re
veals the Names of Men Back
ing the Venture.
NEW YORK, Jan. IS.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: It was
not realized until the hearing was given
to-day by the House Committee o-n
Commerce .to the Grace-Eyre-Cragin
Nicaragua canal syndicate just how
strong is the combination behind W.
R. Grace in the scheme to build the
Nicaragua canal. Every one has
known about the Grace syndicate, but
the names of the men who really com
pose it had been carefully concealed
until they were revealed to-day by Mr.
McClure in a speech before the Com
mittee on Commerce. Then it became
known that the men who propose build
ing the canal are among the best
known capitalists in New York.
Besides Mr. Grace they include D. O.
Mills. Levi P. Mortem, John Jacob As
tor, George D. Havens, John A. McCall,
Warner Miller, H. B. Hollins, W. H.
Gelshenen (president of the Garfield
National Bank), E. R. Ladow, George
C. Williams of the Chemical National
Bank, James Tillman. H. H. Rogers of
the Standard Oil Company, Robert Goe
let, John D. Crimmins. W. D. Sloane,
James T. Woodward, George Westing
house and E. J. Berwind.
LONDON, Jan. 19.â The Standard,
commenting editorially this morning
upon thp debate regarding the Nica
ragua canal in the United States Con
gress, protests strongly against the
Idea that Great Britain would be will
ing to abrogate the Clayton-Bulwer
treaty unless compensated therefor and
unless the neutralization of the canal
were secured beyond Question.
Edward Everett Hale has a sermon

PRESENTMENT THE
CAUSE OF TREASON
General Mercier's Theory as to
Wfyy Captain Dreyfus Is
Guilty.
PARIS, Jan. 18.â The Solr to-day publishes another interview with
General Mercier, who was Minister of War at the time of the condem
nation of Dreyfus. General Mercier reiterates his former statements
and reasserts that the bordereau was certainly tho work of Dreyfus and
not of Esterhazy, who was not aware of Its existence until long sub
sequent to the trial. Under the plea of professional secrecy he de
clined to explain how the War Office obtained the bordereau. The se
cret dossier, he said, consisted of War Ministry documents fully proving
the inferences deduced from the bordereau. The suggestion that it con
tained letters from a foreign sovereign he characterized as "a pure in
vention," as was also, he declared, the statement that M. Casimir-
Perier resigned the Presidency of the republic on account of the Drey
fus affair.
Regarding the motives that prompted Dreyfus to commit the trea
son imputed General Mercier said: "Dreyfus was too fond of the so
ciety of women of a certain class. Had it not been for his reputa
tion in this respect he would have left the military college among the
first three of his class, but owing to his known immoral proclivities he
was placed eleventh. I think ho resented this and that his treason was
probably an act of revenge for It. Dreyfus was also in the habit of-talk
ing unpatriotically. A general was once obliged to censure him for say
ing that the Reichstanders preferred to belong to Germany, as they
were better treated, Dreyfus adding that he quite agreed with them."
Major Esterhazy arrived in Paris to-night. He declined to be in
terviewed.

HARRISBURG, Pa., Jan. 18.â The
feeling between the candidates, their
managers and their followers in the
great battle for United States Senator

Lieutenant Governor Gobin at to-day's
joint assembly of the Senate and House.
Gobin refused to entertain an appeal
from his decision excluding a series of
rules regulating the procedure of the
conference and declaring the Assembly
adjourned when three-fourths of the
Senators and members voted otherwise.

ocrats were hurriedly called together
after the session adjourned by Senator
William Flynn of Allegheny (R.), chair
man of the anti-Quay organization in
the Assembly. The roll call showed 145
Senators and Representatives present.
Of these five Republicans who voted
for QuajÂ» participated in the meeting
and indicated their sympathy with the
movement. A committee of seven was
appointed to prepare a series of reso-
lutions to be submitted to an adjourned
meeting which was held this evening
in the hall of the House of Represen
tatives.
The hall of the House was crowded
with legislators and politicians when
the night meeting was called to order
by Chairman Bliss. Mr. Flynn pre
sented the report. It recites the ex
cluded rules and the right to prescribe
such, declaring that the presiding offi
cer's action violated all rules and pre
cedents, and resolves "that, as the joint
Assembly has the undoubted right to
govern its own procedure and to elect
or change a presiding officer at pleas
ure, the same rules be offered at to
morrow's meeting of the Joint Assem
bly and their consideration demanded
prior to any ballot for United States
Senate." This report is signed by nine
teen Senators and 120 Representatives,
four more than attended the day meet
ing.
In explaining the resolution Mr.
Flynn said there was no law or con
stitutional mandate that allows the
Lieutenant Governor to preside at a
joint Assembly of the Senate and House
to elect a United States Senator; it was
simply a matter of courtesy.
The report was adopted and copies
were distributed among the Senators
and members for signatures.
A motion was offered by Senator
David Martin of Philadelphia (R.),
which was adopted, that a committee
of seven be continued with power to
call the independent Republicans and
Democrats together any time the neces
sity arises. Mr. Fox read section 6,
article IV, of the constitution, to show
that Mr. Gobin, who is a brigadier
general in the volunteer army, has no
right to preside at the conference. The
section follows: "No member of Con
gress or person holding any office un
der the United States or this State
shall exercise the office of Governor or
j Lieutenant Governor."
RETIRES SILVER TO
THE BACKGROUND
Newlands Making His Fight for the
Senate on the Railroad
Issue Alone.
CARSON, New, Jan. 18.â The town is
still talking over the speech delivered
by Congressman Newlands last night.
He denounced the methods of the rail
road and retired the silver issue to the
background. Stewart has made no
reply to Newlands' speech, but places
his hope in his silver record.
The contest in the Assembly
this morning between Shier and Dooley
resulted in Shier withdrawing his peti
tion, leaving the ground clear for
Dooley. Dooley is a Democrat and
will lend his support to a Democratic
nominee.
Some of the most conservative mem
bers believe the Senatorial fight will
result in a deadlock. R. M. Clarke and
Hock Mason are after the Democratic
vote, which draws strength from both
Newlands and Stewart.
Petitions were presented this morn
ing in the House and Senate from
Douglas and Esmeralda counties pro
testing against Stewart's return to the
Senate. They are both based on his
railroad record. They were referred to
committees from the respective coun
ties. They will not be reported until
Monday and the effect will be lost.
ROMEO WINNER
OF THE DERBY
Valiente's Son Captures
the Trophy.
BEATS HIGH - CLASS DOGS
RESULTS OF FIELD TRIALS AT
BAKERSFIELD.
Despite the Sparseness of the Cover,
Some Fine Work Is Witnessed
Daily by the Sports
men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 18.â The six
teenth annual trials of the Pacific
Coast Field Trial Club continued to
day. In the derby fifteen high
class dogs started. Considering
the scare cover their work
was remarkable. Romeo, a setter dog,
owned by John Haauerwas, won first
money, a handsome trophy presented
by the Field of Sports. Romeo is out
of Lady Stamboul, by Valiente. Merry
Heart, a setter dog by Merry Monarch
out of Sweetheart's Last, owned by
Albert Betz, was second. Ashbury, a
pointer dog, owned by Otto Fendner,
was third. Valsmark spoiled his chance
for a place by chasing rabbits and get
ting lost.
The all-age stake started after the
finish of the derby. Romeo, the win
ner of the derby, was an additional
starter. The dogs' run follows: J. C.
Lucas' Alex C. vs. N. I. Donovan's Sen
ator P., Henry Gerber's Fannie G. with
F. B. Naylor's Countess Glenbeierh.
Stockdale Kennels' Sams Bow with J.
C. Terry's Orion, Stockdale Kennels'
Cuba of Kenwood with M. H. Hick
man's Count Harold. Romeo a bye.
All these dogs, except Romeo, Orion
and Count Harold, are pointers. All the
dogs showed up splendidly. The gen
eral opinion is that never have as many
high-class dogs started in one stake
The fine ranging and speed of Senator
P., Alex C, Countess Glenbeieh and
Romeo, and the point work of Sams
Bow, Orion and Cuba of Kenwood make
it hard to pick winners.
The second series will be called to
morrow and probably finished. The
Judges named the following does to run
In the second series: Alex C. with Cuba
of Kenwood, Sams Bow with Senator P.

EXPLODES A BOMB
UNDER THE BILL
Allison's Amendment to
Canal Measure.
PROVIDES FOR BOND ISSUE
VOTE ON THE MATTER POST
PONED AT LAST MOMENT.
In the House Opposition Is Shown to
the Proposed Subsidy to the
Pacific Cable Com
pany.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â The feature
of to-day's session of the Senate was a
speech delivered by Bacon (D.) of Geor
gia, in support of his resolution declar
ing that the United States would not
assume sovereignty over the Philippine
Islands. Bacon is one of the orators of
the Senate, and as he gave himself free
rein, not confining himself to notes, he
spoke strongly and effectually. His
peroration. In which he pictured the
horrors of some of England's methods
of controlling her colonial subjects, was
a beautiful and forceful bit of word
painting.
Following Bacon's speech, the Nica
ragua canal bill was taken up. and re
mained under discussion until 6 o'clock.
Amendment after amendment was vot
ed down, and until almost the last min
ute it seemed likely that a vote on the
measure would be reached, but lust as
a final vote was about to be called for
Allison (R.) of lowa exploded a bomb
under the bill by offering an amand
ment providing that the Secretary of
the Treasury should issue bonds to
raise money with which to construct
the canal. The friends of the measure
then consented to an adjournment.
HOUSE OPPOSITION TO
THE PACIFIC CABLE
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â The com
mittee on interstate and foreign com
merce had the right of way in the
House to-day, and succeeded in pass
ing quite*a number of bills of minor
importance, most of which authorized
the construction of lighthouses, foe
signals, etc. Then the bill to errant the
Pacific Cable Company a subsidy of
$100,000 a year for twenty years for the
construction of and operation of a cable
was called up and a very spirited de-_
bate, which consumed the remainder of
the day, followed.
The opposition was headed by Corliss
(R.) of Michigan, who advocated the
construction of a Government cab'o.
No conclusion was reached at the hour
of adjournment, and as the special or
der under which the House v.as oper
ating to-day expired with ihe adjourn
ment, and as objection v.as made to
fixing another day for its consideration,
it goes over indefinitely until tiie com
mittee can get another day or until
a special order is adopted.
Case Against Bateman Continued.
The wise of Thomas Fitzgerald against
Bateman Brothers, the contractors for
the Hall of Justice, was called in Justice
(.'(ink's court yesterday. Owing to an
other case being on trial it went over un
til m-xt Monday ;it 10 a. m. Fitzgerald
waa employed on the Hall of Justice and
claims the contractors are indebted to
him in the sum of $1.77 75 for services ren
dered as bricklayer. The firm denies the
Indebtedness. The complainant also af
firms that a number of employes were in
duced to sign a receipt for wages which
have not been paid.

CONQUEROR OF
SANTIAGO IS
RETURNED HOME
General Shafter Ar
rived Last Night.
WELCOMED BY THE MAYOR
PUBLIC RECEPTION AT THE PAL
ACE TO-MORROW EVENING.
General Shafter Tells Why He Was
Attacked by the Yellow Press
Reporters â Simply Did
His Duty.
After an absence of nearly nine
months Major General W. R. Shatter
returned to San Francisco at 7 o'clock
last night from Washington. D. C. He
! was accompanied by his aid-de-camp.
Major Hubert 11. Noble, Captain E. H.
Plummer and Captain W. H. McKit
trick and wife. J. N. Shafter of San
Antonio, a brother of the general, with
his wife and son, were also in the
party. In addition to these there was
Mrs. Captain McKlttrick'a maid and
Mariano Uterro, a 16-<year-old Cuban
boy, who returned to this country from
Santiago with General Shafter as his
valet. The distinguished party was
met at the Oakland mole by General
R. H. Warfield, Colonel W. R. Smed
berg. Colonel J. C. Currier, George WÂ«
â â  Spencer.
General Shafter received a warm wel
. come and he returned the same with
equal warmth, at the same time ex
' -pressing himself as being more than
'. glad to be back in San Francisco. The
general wore his full uniform as a
major general, with the exception that
in place of his army cape he wore a light
top coat. Captains Noble and McKit
trick wore in uniform. As soon as the
general and party had shaken hands
with the members of the Loyal Legion,
the entire party went aboard the
Berkeley. General Shafter looked to
be in excellent health and is quite as
â  robust as when he left here last
April. He seems to have en
tirely recovered from the effects of the
malaria which he contracted in the
Cuban campaign. He talked very
pleasantly and freely.
He said: "I am glad to get back in
California. There are many reasons
why I wanted to return. My home is
â  here and besides I have many ties that
bind me to the West, to say nothing of
my business interests here. At pres
ent I aiff in excellent health and I be
lieve that I have entirely recovered
from the malarial fever that I con
tracted in Cuba. Of course, I am aware
that the public desires to know what I
have to say now that I have returned.
There has been much written and more
said about my campaign, but the fact
remains that I was sent to do a certain
thing and I did it. This war was a
very different one from the civil war.
We had not only the Spaniards to fight,
but we had sickness as well. The
climatic conditions were such that sick
ness could not be prevented. The only
wonder to me is that it did not break
out before it did. As for myself I lost
sixty pounds in thirty days, but de
spit-- this fact I was in my saddle every
day with the exception of one.
"As for the attacks that were made
on me by the representatives of the
Journal and Richard H. Davis, they
can be accounted for when the animus
is known. Davis was angered at me
because I would not permit him to be
land' 1 before the army or any of the
other war correspondents. I had my
reasons for not allowing any one to
land before the army did, and I was
forced to tell Davis that no matter
how many papers he represented he
would have to obey my orders. The
trouble with the Journal arose because
when Santiago surrendered I had to ar
rest three of its correspondent and send
them bark to New York. They went
into the city after it surrendered, when
it was filled with Cubans and armed
Spaniards (for there had not been
time for all of the Spaniards to lay
down their arms) and began to put up
flaring poster?;, on which was 'Remem
ber the Maine.' To the Spaniards this
was like a red flag to a bull, and if I
had not had them taken down at once
there would have been trouble.
"Again it has been charged that I
was a friend of the administration.
This is too absurd to be discussed. I
simply did my duty and accomplished
the work that was given me to do. It
is well enough for those who desire to
attack the administration to use me as
their target. Regarding the work of
our men in Cuba too much cannot be
said of them. They deserve all the
praise that can be bestowed on them.
There is no questioning the bravery of
the Spaniards either, but they could
not fight our men. There can be made
no comparison in marksmanship."
There was no suggestion of boast in
General Shafter's remarks. He cour
teously answered all questions asked
him. When asked what were his plans
for assuming command of this depart
ment he stated that he would relieve
General Merriam of command at noon
to-day.
As soon as the Berkeley had made
her slip on this side Mayor Phelan at
the head of a delegation of prominent
citizens came aboard to welcome the
general. As the party came down to
enter their carriages an eager crowd
surged about General Shafter, but the
police were on hand and they pre
vented it from impeding his progress.
General Merriam had thoughtfully pro
vided his carriage, and into this Gen
eral Shafter, Captain McKlttrick and
â¢ wife and Major Noble entered and were
rapidly driven to the Palace. The rest
of the party with Mayor Phelan fol
lowed. The general's arrival at the
Palace created much excitement among
the guests, who were assembled in the
lobby expecting him. As he 'alighted
he was received by Major General Mer
riam. The two veterans exchanged
warm greetings. Captain McKittrick
â  registered for the party and as soon as
. they were assigned rooms they retired
to them to prepare for dinner.
General Shaft <-r will take up his resi
dence at Fort Mason this morning, and
at noon to-day he will formally relieve
General Merriam of command of this
' department. The public reception to be
tendered General Shafter will be held
at the Palace at 9 o'clock to-morrow
evening. The committee of arrange
ments met yesterday and completed the
final preparations. The reception is to
be one of the largest of its kind ever
â â¢ held in this city. In addition to the
committee of arrangements, which con
sists of Mayor Phelan, Colonel A. S.
Hubbard, Colonel J. C. Currier, General
â¢ R. H. Warfield, Colonel C. Mason Kinne,

C. Masteller and Colonel A. G. Hawes,
there is to be a committee of one hun

to form the reception committee proper.
They will meet in the parlors of the
hotel at 8:30 o'clock. There will be a

sufficient number of police on hand to
keep the crowd in line and moving.
The reception committee is composed
of the representatives of the city's so
cial, commercial and army life. The
veterans of the Grand Army of the Re
public, in full uniform, are to be pres
ent as an escort of honor to General
Shafter. Other organizations will also
be present. The Fourth Cavalry Band
will be stationed in the court and will
furnish the music during the reception.
The band was courteously tendered by
General C. E. Compton, commanding
the Presidio. All of the army officers
now on duty here will be present.
One of the most interesting person
ages in the general's party is Mariano
Uterro, his valet. The boy is only 16.
He is very handsome and speaks Eng
lish. He used to shave General Shafter
when he was in Santiago and the gen
eral became so attached to him that he
offered to bring him to this country as
his valet and the boy accepted. He is
much interested in all that he sees, and
General Shafter declares that he has
lost him on an average of every five
minutes since he has had him. On the
trip out he had to keep an eye on the
boy to prevent his getting off at every
station.
In addition to the public reception to
be tendered General Shafter on Friday
evening, the prominent citizens of the
city, desiring to further express to the
general the high esteem in which he is
held by them, have arranged for a
series of entertainments in his honor.
On Saturday evening he will be the
guest of the Union League Club at a
dinner, and on next Wednesday he will
be entertained by the members of the
Pacific Union.

OSGOOD'S DUAL LIFE.
His Wife Charges Him With Bigamy,
His Employers With Em
bezzlement.
George LÂ«. Osgood, late commercial trav
eler for^Seegelken & Buckner, the Jack
son-street liquor*merchants, has sufficient
trouble, on â¢ hand at the present time to
keep him busy for some time. Os-good's
late employers have charged him with
embezzlement, and" while he has been en
deavoring'to extricate himself from this
mess his young _wife, or at least wife No.
2..' has confronted 1 " him with a charge of
bigamy and intimates arrest and prosecu
tion,, much to .his discomfiture.
Relatives have agreed to make good Os
good's shortage. Mr. Seegelken affirmt-d
last evening, and although Seegelken was
determined up to a short time ago to pros
ecute his salesman, proceedings against
him will -probably bo dropped and he will
be allowed to go free. Such an amicable
settlement has not be^n reached with Mrs.
Osgood, however. She claims that her
husband had a wife living when he mar
ried her and can establish the fact that
wife No. 1 is. still living. What the out
come will be no one knows. It all rests
with Osgood's late employers and the
young woman who claims he has deceived
her. They may be disposed to be lenient,
but they rriay not, and in this rests the
outcome.

BEEF INTERESTS
MAY SECURE MILES'
COURT=MARTIAL
Detail of the Court Selected to
Try Charges Against Com=
missary=General Eagan.
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.â There is serious talk in administration cir
cles as to the advisability of cdurt-martialing General Miles or of reliev
ing him from duty as commanding general of the army. It is manifest
that the President and Secretary of War are not yet done with General
Miles, and that it is proposed to take action of some kind against him;
but what its character will be will depend largely upon developments
of the Eagan trial and of the report of the War Investigation Commis
sion. The administration is incensed at General Miles because of the
tenacity with which he has continued the beef investigation, notwith
standing that the war commission found, as a result of its inquiry, that
the beef furnished to the army was good and had not undergone chemi
cal treatment. Beef packers and members of Congress are stiffening the
backbone of the administration by the use of their influence, and it
would not be surprising to the friends of General Miles if the matter
should culminate in his relief or court-martial.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18.â The detail
for the court-martial which is to try
Commissary. General Eagan on charges
growing out of his statements before
the War Investigation Commission last
week, in which he - attacked General
Miles, was made public at the War De
partment to-night. The court is made
up of thirteen army, officers, of whom
Major General -Wesley Merritt is at the
head, and a judge advocate, and it is
to meet in this city on Wednesday, the
25th inst, or as soon thereafter as
practicable, this qualification being
necessary because a number of the
members are at distant points and will
require some days to adjust their af
fairs and reach this city. All the of
ficers composing the court, save one,
are from the regular army, a number
of whom, however, during the war, ac
cepted volunteer rank and still hold
those commissions. Major General
Butler is the only one who is not con
nected with ' the regular army. Ad
jutant General Corbin' returned early
In the evening from his trip to New
York, where he went to witness the de
parture of the transport Grant for
Manila 'and came to the War Depart
ment .about 3:30 o'clock. He then
signed the 'formal order promulgating
the detail for the court, which is as

H. C. CORBIN, Adjutant General.
General Corbin stated that the order
for the appointment of the court
martial would be delivered to General
Eagan either* to-night or to-morrow
morning. This, it is expected, will be
done .by an officer or an employe of the
adjutant, general's office. Its receipt
and acknowledgment by the commis
sary general, will be tantamount to the
relief of that officer from his present
duties and he will turn over its affairs
either to some one designated to act
by the Secretary of War, or to the of
ficer,, next, in charge of the department.
Colonel ' George Davis of the commis
sary department is now on duty with
General" Eagan and it may be that he
will be detailed to take charge of the
office.
If the course indicated by an officer
of the adjutant general's office to
night is followed the probability is that
General Eagan will not be placed un
der actual arrest and deprived of any of.
his liberties pending and during the
trial, but will be subjected only to con

CONTEMPLATES LEGALACTION
SUDDEN CHANGES ASTONISH
SONOBA MINERS.
Rumors of Sensational Suits to Be
Brought Against the Partners
of the Well-Known Mm
ing Man.
Captain Nevills, the millionaire mine
owner, is oilce more in hot water. This
time it is the wealth-producing Raw
hide mine which is causing him mental
worry. If his present intentions hold
for a few days he will file a few suits
that promise sensational reading for
the mining public.
Nevills is a third owner in the great
Rawhide mine, the remaining portion
being the property of John Ballard and
W. H. Martin in joint partnership. For
many years Nevills has managed the
mine, dividing his residence between
Sonora, which is not many miles dis
tant from the Rawhide, and this city.
The latest change, as the story goes, is
that Nevills has been forced out of the
management by the combination of the
other two mineowners and the mine
has been placed in the hands of Sydney
Sprout, the builder of the electric plant
which supplies the operating power of
the Rawhide.
Ballard and Martin have been on the
ground for the past week in the ab
sence of Captain Nevills, who is now in
San Francisco. Captain Nevills said
last night that his men were in control
of the mine, and while he had not been
apprised of his displacement in favor of
Sprout, yet he admitted that he knew
that this project was on foot.
"There will be some big surprises in
a few days," he said last night. "My
attorneys, W. H. Ricketts and Thomas
Riordan, are now preparing suits which j
will be filed this week, and I can tell
yo-u they are full of big sensations.
These men think they have forced me j
out of it, but they will find that they
are mistaken. I will visit the mine in
a few days and look after matters my
self."
Attorney Riordan, when seen last
night, said that he was at work on le
gal papers which would be ready for
filing by Saturday and which would as
tonish Mr. Nevills' copartners and
others. He would not divulge the na
ture of the suits.
Rumors that the control of these
mines was to be taken' from Nevills
have been frequent, but nothing de
veloped until the bountiful rains of the
last few weeks gave the owners a
chance to resume work. Monday work
began in the Rawhide, and the ab
sence of Nevills after the long shut
down gave rise to considerable gossip.
Messrs. Ballard and Martin have been
on the ground for over a week, but they
kept their own counsel, until now it is
said to have been officially given out
that Captain Nevills will no longer su
perintend the work at the mines. Com
mon report has it that Ballard and
Martin have long been dissatisfied with
Nevills' actions, and they finally de
cided to take the reins in their own
hands.
This radical and sudden change has,
it appears, created more than ordin
ary excitement among the miners of
Tuolumne County, and they all wonder
what will happen next. The arrival of
Captain Nevills at Sonora is awaited
with suppressed excitement. Captain
Nevills has had absolute control of the
company interests for over nine years.
Some time after the decision in Boston,
which was adverse to the Eastern
claimants, who sought to purchase the
Rawhide, the owners of the mine got
together and organized a new corpora
tion. Before that the Rawhide was in
corporated, but the App was worked
under a partnership. Under the new
deal the properties were consolidated
and Ballard and Martin held two
thirds of the stock and Nevills held
one-third.
The Rawhide is one of the richest
mines' in the world, and Captain Nev
ills, who has long been considered the
moving spirit in its development, Is
known to every miner in the West.
To prevent any surpirse constables
are said to have been placed on duty at
the Rawhide and App mines.
"PLUTO" CLAIMS HIS
TRAINERS ROBBED HIM
NEW YORK, Jan. 18.â "Young
Pluto," the Australian prize fighter,
who was beaten here last night by
George Dixon, appeared in the Police
Court to-day and was granted sum
mons ifor his trainers. "Pluto," or Wil
liam Dudley Brown, as the young col
ored prize fighter is known in private
life, alleges that William Akers and
William Shannon, his trainers, both of
San Francisco, had appropriated his
share of last night's purse, $325. Fur
ther, Pluto said that when he asked his
trainers for the money they knocked
him down, beat him, kicked* him and
finally threw him out of the room.
Tom O'Rourke, manager of the Lenox
Athletic Club, where "Pluto" had pre
viously been pounded by Dixon, told
Pluto that his money had been handed
over to the trainers.
Pluto later appearedd at police head
quarters and asked that a detective be
sent with him to serve the summons.
Pluto said he was afraid of his train
ers. A detective was sent with him.
