A VIA, Samoan Islands.
March 23 (via Auckland,
N. Z., March 29).â The
troubles growing out of the elec
tion of a King of Samoa have
taken a more serious turn and re
sulted in the bombardment of na
tive villages along the sliore by j
the United States cruiser' Phila
delphia, Admiral Kautz' com
manding, and the British cruisers
Porpoise and Royalist. The
bombardment has continued in
termittently, for eight days. Sev
eral villages have been burned,
and there have been a number of j
casualties among the American j
and British sailors and marines.
As yet it is impossible to estimate
the number of natives killed or
injured.
As Mataafa and his chiefs, con
stituting the provisional govern
ment, continued to violate the
Berlin treaty after the arrival of
the Philadelphia, Admiral Kautz
summoned the various consuls
and the senior naval officers to a
conference on board the Philadel
phia, when the whole situation
was canvassed. The upshot was
a resolution to dismiss the pro
visional government, and Ad
miral Kautz issued a proclama
tion calling upon Mataafa and his
chiefs to return to their homes.
Mataafa evacuated Mulinuu,

the town he had made his head
quarters, and went into the in
terior.
Herr Rose, the German Con
sul at Apia, issued a proclamation
supplementing the one he had
issued several weeks before, up
holding the provisional govern
ment. As a result of this the
Mataafans assembled in large
force and hemmed in the tow;i.
The British cruiser Royalist
brought the Malietoa prisoners
from the islands to which they
had been transferred by the pro
visional government.
The Americans then fortified
Mulinuu, where 22,000 Malie
toans took refuge. The rebels â
the adherents of Mataafa â barri
caded the roads within the muni
cipality and seized the British
houses. An ultimatum was sent
to them ordering them to evacu
ate, and threatening them, in the
event of refusal, with a bombard
ment, to commence at 1 o'clock
on the afternoon of March 15.
This warning was ignored, and
the rebels commenced an attack
in the direction of Ihe United
States and British consulates
about hah' an hour before the
time fixed for the iDombardment.
The Philadelphia, Porpoise and
Royalist opened fire upon the
distant villages. There was great
difficulty in locating the enemy,
owing to the dense forest, but

several shore villages were soon
in flames.
A defective from the Phil
adelphia exploded near the
American consulate, and the

caped. A fragment struck the
leg of Private Rndge, shattering
it so badly as to necessitate am

Another fragment traversed to
the German consulate, smashing
the crockery. The Germans
then went on board the German
cruiser Falke.
During the night the rebels
made a hot attack on the town.

British marine was shot in the leg
by a sentry of his own' party,
another was shot in the foot, and
an American sentry was killed at
his post.
The bombardment continuing,
the inhabitants of the town took
refqge on board the Royalist,
greatly crowding the vessel.
The Porpoise has shelled the
villages east and west of Apia and
captured many boats.
The Americans and British are
fighting splendidly together, but
there is a bitter feeling against
the Germans.
Two men, a British and a Ger

The bombardment of the jun

Most of the Rowena Lee's crew lived j
in Memphis. The names of her pas- j
sengers cannot be learned. The boat
was the property of the Lees at Mem
phis.
The Rowena Lee was laden with rail
road iron for Memphis, with some pack
ages of way freight. She passed this
point shortly before noon. She had fin
ished discharging and taking on cargo
at Tyler, and had cast off her lines,
when a terrific explosion occurred,
which to those on the bank who were
watching her seemed to cause her to
break in two amidships. The broken
ends of the craft were forced upward
until each stood momentarily on end
and then disappeared under water. The
upper works were thrown up with such
force that they were literally broken
into kindling wood and the air was
filled with wreckage of the pilot-house
and cabin, with the light cabin furni
ture and with luckless human beings
who- constituted her crew and passen
gers. That tlYe captain and one of the
mates escaped is regarded as miracu
lous by those who saw the boat de
stroyed.
The current at Tyler is swift, and,
though dazed, the eye-witnesses acted
as promptly as they could in the mat
ter of manning: skiffs and getting out
to the wreckage. They succeeded in
saving no lives except those noted, and
they prcbably would not have been
saved had they not providentially been
caught in and kept afloat by a large
section of the cabin. Both were un
conscious, and since being revived cun
give no coherent account of the occur
rence. Not another body was seen by
the .would-be rescuers, and the thetrry
is that all were rendered unconscious
by the concussion, and, being unable to
help themselves in any way, sank im
mediately they struck the water.
Neither Captain Carvell nor Mate
Crasty has any theory regarding the
cause of the catastrophe. They are not
inclined to believe the boilers burst.

AMERICANS BEGIN
THE ADVANCE UPON
AGUINALDO'S CAPITAL
MANILA, March 30â10 a. m.â The American forces began the advance from Giguinto at day
break this morning. While crossing a bridge about half a mile from that place they were attacked by
the insurgents, who were gathered in force. They gave desperate battle. The engagement lasted
fully two hours.
The Americans' loss is unofficially reported as ten killed and thirty wounded. They were cross
ing the bridge in two columns of fours, the Pennsylvania Regiment in advance, closely followed by the
Kansas Volunteers. When half way over the insurgents, who were concealed in the brush, opened a
galling fire. The men never wavered and maintained their steady advance.
A Colt rapid fire gun was hurried to the scene and the jungle was literally raked. The insur
gent loss in killed alone is upwards of 100.
The insurgents finally retreated upon Malolos in great disorder. It is thought they are on the
way to the mountains. At least three thousand were engaged in this morning's skirmish. Evidences on
every hand are that the Americans will find Malotos deserted.
The army is now resting and will advance upon Malolo: this afternoon.
The Utah Battery was also engaged in this morning's brush and had one killed. The Pennsyl
vanians suffered heavily.

MANILA. Mar.eh 29.â At 6
o'clock this morning a fly
ing column, with the Third Ar
tillery and the Montana and 1 Kan
sas Volunteers on the left of the
railroad and the Pennsylvania,
South Dakota and Nebraska Vol
unteers on the right, started for
Bocave across two miles of open
fields.
The insurgents began to lire
immediately, and continued until
the troops reached the river at
Bocave. The American troops
never wavered.
The Nebraska Regiment swung
in from the extreme left and
doubled up the insurgent left at
the river. The insurgents ran,
after some rails had been re
moved from the railroad.
Wounded insurgents reported
that the enemy had retreated to
Malolos. .
In the Pennsylvania Regiment
there were one killed and five
wQiinded.
I he Kansas Regiment lost one
officer and fifteen privates were
wounded. In the Montana Regi T
ment five men were wounded and
in the Nebraska Regiment one
man was killed and ten wounded.
The American advance was
wonderfully rapid, considering
that the enemy destroyed the
bridges as they fled. There was
no resistance at Bigaa.
The troops advanced quickly,
in contracted lines, to the town
of Giguinto. The Pennsylvania
Regiment crossed the bridge as
the advance guard, and unex
pectedly the insurgents concealed
in the woods opened a heavy fire.
Then the Kansas Regiment and
one battalion of the South Da-
kota Regiment rushed over the
bridge under fire.
Two of the Utah Battery guns
and one Colt rapid-fire also came
into action. The insurgents had
made trenches across' the rail-
road. Our loss was several killed
and more than twenty wounded
before the insurgents were driven
off. Our troops are now en
camped two and a half miles from
Malolos.

WASHINGTON, March 29â The following advices from
Manila were received by the War Department to-night:
MANILA, March 30 .âAdjutant General, Washington:
Mac Arthur advanced at 6 o'clock yesterday morning from
Marilao. Passed rapidly to Bocave, At 11:45 he took up his
advance for Bigaa, and at 3:15 in the afternoon for Giguinto,
three and a half miles froiÂ»i Malolos, reaching that point at 5
P. M. The casualties for the day were about 70, and there
was fierce fighting in the afternoon. The troops made the
crossing of the river at Giguinto by working the artillery
over the railroad bridge by hand and swimming the mules
against fierce resistance. The railroad to the extreme front
is nearly repaired, and will resupply the troops to-day.

Rents' faith in Affuinaldo is destroyed.
Aguinalchr, with his family, is said to be
preparing: to flee from Malolos. Gen
eral Mac Arthur is making ready an ar
mored railroad car for further opera
tions.
The rebels burned the villages as
they retreated in bad order toward
Malolos. The enemy also tore up sec
tions of the railroad in many places
and attempted to burn the bridge at
Bigaa, but the fire was extinguished
owing to the timely arrival of the
Americans. The rebels had not finished
their trenches along the line of to-day's
march, showing they were not prepared
for* our advance. It is believed here,
however, that there will be a hard fight
before Malolos is taken.
The Minnesota regiments reinforced
the division to-day, marching from the
water works during the night to Ma
nila and going to the front by train.
The Filipinos fired volleys yesterday
evening for the purpose of drawing
the American fire and discovering the
locality of our positions. Two men of
the Pennsylvania Regiment and one
man belonging to the Dakota Regiment
were wounded. The Americans re
mained silent.
The country between Marilao and
Manila presents a picture of desolation.
Smoke is curling from hundreds of ash
heaps, and the remains of trees and
fences torn by shrapnel are to be seen
everywhere. â¢ The general appearance
of the region is as if it had been swept
by a cyclone. The roads are strewn
with the furniture and clothing drop
ped in flight by the Filipinos. The only
persons remaining behind are a few
aged ones too intirm to eacape. They
camp beside the ruins of their former
homes and beg passers-by for any kind
of assistance. The majority of them
.are living on the generosity of our sol
diers, who give them portions of their
rations. The dogs of the Filipinos
cower in the bushes, still terrified and
barking, while hundreds of pigs are j
to be seen busily searching for food.
Bodies of dead Filipinos are stranded
in the shallows of the river or are rest
ing in the jungle, where they crawled
to die or were left in the wake of the
hurriedly retreating army. These bodies
give fcrth a horrible odor, but there is
no time at present to bury them.
The inhabitants who fled from Man
lac- left in such a panic that on table? j
our soldiers found spread money and !
valuables and in the rooms were trunks
containing other property of value, j
This was the case in most of the houses j
deserted. They were not molested by i
our soldiers, but the Chinese who slip j
in between the armies are looting when
they can and have taken possession :>Â£ j
several houses, over which they raised
Chinese flags, some of which were torn
down.
An old woman was fcjund hidden in a i
house yesterday, Just dead, apparently
from fright and hunger.

statements made by Agoncillo to the
effect that Consuls Williams and Wild
man had promised Aguinaldo and his
/rienris that the United States would
grant absolute independence to the
Philippines as soon as the islands were
taken from Spain. Consul Williams de
nies this explicitly. He writes:
"I never saw Agoncillo nor made such
a promise to any Filipino. On the con
trary, when Aguinaldo's leaders applied
to me at Hongkong to be allowed to re
turn with me to Manila one of the pro
visions of the conditions under which I
agreed to give them such aid as I was
able to give was that they were to be
subject at all times to the naval ami
military authority of the United States.
This was agreed to before I allowed
them to accompany me April 27, 1898,
to Mirs Bay. where the fleet awaited
my coming." Admiral Dewey knows all
about the conditions which I imposed
and complimented me on my foresight
and thoughtfulness."
This agrees with reports sent by Con

from time to time and made public
through the press dispatches from
Washington.

from General Otis for more ti'oops than

artillery. These were placed at once
under orders for Manila and are. on
their way to San Francisco. They will
sail about the 16th of April. Those who
insist that the provisional army must
be organized say that they have infor
mation from the Philippines which indi
cates that a "volunteer army cannot be
enlisted for six months, as provided for
in the bill, from the volunteers who will
be mustered out when the ratifications
of peace are exchanged. It is claimed
that these volunteers will demand,
transportation home at once, and that
there will "not be enough regulars in

the Filipinos. . â¢ ~
Adjutant General Corbin says that
Information received direct from.Oen

Mr. Broadhead, who paid the remainder
of the price for the road in court to-day,
declined to discuss the purchase, but it

MACARTHUR'S MARCH
Troops Meeting Less Resistance
From the Enemy During the
Forward Movement.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 29.â When
General Otis reported to the War De
partment early to-day that at 6 o'clock
this morning the American troops un
der Mac Arthur again took up their ad
vance there was renewed expectation
of fighting and decisive developments.
General < 'tis' dispatch covered much
ground, not only in showing the position
of <>ur troops, but also the extent of
the advance contemplated for the day.
The halt and rest of yesterday gave a
new aspect to the advance, for instead
of a Inng-continued fight with jaded
troops and exhausted supplies Mac-
Arthur began practically a new ad
vance to-day with his men refreshed
and well supplied.
Major Simpsun, who is closely follow
ing the movement of the troops .by
means of the military map, regarded
General Otis' dispatch as showing that
the plan to-day was to reach Bigaa,
seven miles from Malolos, and thejte
wait until to-morrow for the final ad
vance on Malolos. The march cut out
for to-day covers about seven miles.
The two towns mentioned, Bocave and
Bigaa, are the only unes along the line
of march and they are small pueblos.
There is, however, a constant succes
sion of haciendas and plantations,
.showing that the road lies through a
rather fertile country. There* are two
natural obstacles lying along the rout-,
first, the Marilao River, and further on
the Balucan.
The bridge over the Marilao River
has been burned, but all reports indi
cate that the engineers have succeeded
in repairing it. Bigaa is just beyond
the Balucan River, so that General
Otis' report that Mac-Arthur's advance
".'will continue to Bigua" was construed
at the War Department to mean that
the two rivers would be passed before
to-day'a advance closed. Being Beven
miles from Malolos our forces can
either cover that distance to-morrow
or else turn southward and reduce the
large city of Balucan, on the left. The
expectation- here is that they will keep
on to Malolos arid that to-morrow nip.ht
will see them near the insurgent camp.
In the meantime the indications are
that the fighting will not be as severe
as it was Saturday and Sunday, i<i
General Otis' dispatch of this morning
says: "Enemy's resistance not so \ ig
orous to-day. " This is attributed to
the fact that our forces are now. in a
more open country, where the methods
of guerrilla fighting are not so rapidly
executed.
In the meantime' the report that th"
enemy has destroyed the railway and
telegraph lines compels our engineers
practically to build a. railroad and tele
graph line as bur troops advance.
A high official of the War Department
summed up the situation as follows:
The troops are in excellent condi
tion. Full supplies are on hand and
the supply trains are keeping abreast
of the men. The enemy is losing heart
and falling back and to-night we will
be within seven miles of the enemy's
capital."
There was some discussion in official
â  circles regarding the proclamation
which th" Philippine Commission may
issue. This action, it is said, is entirely
discretionary with the commission. It
may issue its proclamation after Gen
eral Otis reaches Malolos, or it may de
lay it until the tfme seems more oppor
tune. If, as reported in some quarters,
tho Filipinos abandon Malolos as a cap
ita! and go farther north, it is possible
(hat the proclamation may be with
held. It is intended that the proclama
tion shall declare the purpose of the
Government of the United States in the
â  of Luzon, and it may seem de-
Birable to establish fully the authority

Charles P. Braslan, who claims to be di
rector by virtue of election to the board
after the failure, will be present and in
sist on taking a hand in the management
of the institution. This will make on*
too many directors, and as soon as the
first vote shall have been taken the trou

Arrival of the Transport
Crook.
Special Dis=patch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 29.â The d^ad
bodies of 68S American soldiers, regu
lars and volunteers, arrived to-day on
board the United States transport
Crook, and they will remain there until
to-morrow morning before the authori
ties will try to land them on native soil.
It was the intention to dock the vessel
at once, but wind and tide were more
than the mariners in charge could com
bat and it was finally decided not to
make the dock until to-morrow.
Captain Charles A. Tamon. who com
mands the transport, sent word to
army headquarters that with the
aid of four or five tugs he would be
able to get alongside of the pier. But i
when these accessories were sent him.
he said the risk was too great and de
cided he would await more favorable
auspices for landing.
Meanwhile relatives and friends of j
the dead had assembled on the wharf,
and many of them tried in various
ways to gain admittance to the pier.
' The United States navy yard tug
Nina arrived at the Government pier
about noon. She had no guaia" of honor
on board, and those most closely in
terested wondered at the fact, as it was
understood that a guard of United
States marines was to receive the re
mains of the sailors and marines sud
posed to be on board the Crook.
The naval officers in command were
Informed that the transport had not
called at Guantanamo, and conseauent
lyi there were no bodies of marines or
naval men on board. The navy tutf's
commander thereupon ordered a rever
sal of the engines and the naval craft
went back to the Brooklyn yard.
Captain Buck, with a company of the
Thirteenth United States Infantry, ar
rived on a tug from Governor's Island,
and stationed his men on the pier as a
guard of honor.
The soldiers remained on the dock for
over two hours, but Captain Buck as
certained that there was no possibility
of the Crook's arriviner this afternoon
and ordered his men back to their bar
racks.
Late in the afternoon a representa
tive of the Associated Press went
aboard the transport. On the trooo
deck, twelve feet below th- main deck,
the coffins were laid four deep. Each
< Mski't was inclosed in a pine wood box,
on one end of which the name of the
deceased and his regiment was sten
ciled in black letters. In addition to
this was marked the number of the
grave, plot or trench fn>m which the
body had been disinterred.
OBJECTED TO PAYING
FIVE DOLLARS A SEAT
Los Angeles Music Lovers Give the
Ellis Opera Company a Luke
warm Reception.
LOS ANGELES. March 29.â The superb
production of '.'Carmen," with De Lussan
in her great creation, was witnessed by
a half-filled house to-night. Critics unite
in Baying that, on tho whole, the cast
was superior to that of ''Faust" on the
great Melba night. Notwithstanding the
stellar features of the Ellis Opera Com
pany, thf brief operatic season was nol
a financial success, as the box office re
ceipts, contrary to expectations, are
short $1300. Many causes conspired to
<n>ale this void in the exchequer, the
principal one being that tho performances
were given during Holy Week, the final
days of prayer in Lent, and that many
lovers of music demurred to paying $5
a seat.

SECOND LEXOW
FOR NEW YORK
Legislative Investigation
of Bribery.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALBANY. N. V.. March 29.â A most
dramatic scene was enacted in the As-
Bembly to-day when the cities commit
tee unexpectedly recommended a reso
lution calling for the appointment by
the Speaker of an investigating com
mittee to inquire Into reports that a
fund had been raised by assessment
among the members of the New York*
City police force to defeat by bribery
the passage of the pending police bills,
the chief among which provides for a
eingle-headed commission to be ap
pointed by the Mayor and subject to
removal by the Governor.
The Democratic members denounced
â¢he attempt to force the resolution as a
\ ulation of the rights of the minority.
The Speaker ruled against the Demo
cratic: leader, "and a scene of disorder
and confusion ensued.
At one point during the debate, Mr.
Green of New York shook his fist in
the face of the Republican leader, Mr.
Aldis.
After five amendments to the resolu
tion calling- for the extension of inves
tigation of the rumors of bribery in
connection with the Astoria gas bill
and other measures had been defeated,
the original resolution was passed after
all but seven of the Democratic mem
bers had left the chamber by a vote of
87 to 7. â¢
THE DAISY BELLE'S
OUTPUT DECREASING
Ledge Has Widened to Two Feet, but
Is Not as Kich as the First

REDDING. March 28.â W. M. Dale, one
of the owners of the Daisy Belle mine of
Furnaceville, was in town on Monday
with another shipment of gold dust. He
would not disclose the amount. It is cer
tain, however, that the Daisy Belle is not

the ore Showing free gold in abun
dan< i . The only way the owners have of
extracting the precious metal is by hand
mortaring the ore, only the richest being
thus treated. The rest is piled on the
dumps while development work goes
steadily forward.
J. H. Moore bought a third interest in
the prospect a few days before the strike
was made for $20. Dale and Silence were
discouraged by the outlook, and when
Moore came along and offered a double
eagle for an interest they thought It
would be "just Ilk" getting $20 from home."
An infusion of new blood, however, gave
the men courage to go ahead, and on the
third or fourth day they struck it. Moore's
third interest netted him at least $15"0 in
three days- on an investment ofs2o and the
exercise of a little muscle.
It is estimated that the miners have
several thousand dollars on the dumps.
There is no opportunity to have the ore
milled nearer than Redding. Tt will be
sacked and shipped, probably to San Fran
cisco.

FOR AN IMPORTANT
NAVAL STATION
Steps Being Taken by the War De

of Pearl Harbor.
NEW YORK. March 29.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Prepara
tory to the establishment of an impor
tant naval station at Pearl Harbor, Ha
waii, steps are being taken by the War
Department to improve the harbor.
Rear Admiral Walker, while in com
mand of the Pacific station, made ;i care
ful survey of the harbor, and with dredg
ing, which he suggests, it is apparent
ample water can be secured leading to a
spot well protected where he recom
mended the naval station be located. In
the river and harbor act there is v pro
vision appropriating $100,000 for complet
ing the Improvement of the harbor. Rear
Admiral Walker's report will be turned
over to General Wilson. Chief of En
gineers.
I understand Rear Admiral Entlkott,
â¢ 'hicf of the Bureau of Yards and Docks,
will recommend that Congress authorize
the construction of a Btone dock at Pearl
Harbor, with the hecessary repair shops,
so that repairs can be made to any ves
sel of the United States navy arriving in
Hawaiian waters.
General "Wilson has also taken meas
ures tn secure information respecting the
fortifications of Porto Rico and addition
al fortifications which should be con
structed so as to protect the island".

THREE LIBRARIANS NOW.
Peculiar Result of a Los Angeles
Political Row.
LOS ANGELES. March 29.â The mys
terious meeting of the Library Trustees
this afternoon has further complicated the
anomalous position which they and the
librarian occupy. At a secret session the
Trustees, ignoring the former resolution
appointing President Dockweiler librarian
pro tern, and without rescinding- that or
der, adopted a resolution appointing Mis.;
Gleason librarian until the further pleas
ure of the board, or until the incoming
board disposes of the matter in another
form.
Although Mrs. Harriet C. Wadk'igh was
by resolution removed from the position
of librarian and excluded from to-day's
session, she is still performing her duties
as if no order had been made vacating the
position. Mrs. Wadleigh says she will con
tinue t<- Ignore all the acts of the hoard
and nothing that 11 can do will interfere

Editor Willard of the Express, who was

time he will be induced to accept the posi
tion.

BITUMINOUS COAL
FOUND IN ALASKA
Extensive Beds to Be
Developed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, March 29.â According to
advices received from the Aleutian
Peninsula great beds of rich bitumin
ous coal have been discovered near the
seashore at Chignik Bay. The find was
made by the Chignik Bay Coal and
Fish Company, which is now preparing
i" open coaling stations on Akun Is
land and at Constantine Harbor, on
Amchitka Island, one of the outer
points of the peninsula.
Amchitka is just half way between
this port and Yokohama and is said to
have a perfect harbor. All the Oriental
liners on the northern route and those
running to St. Michaels pass in close
proximity to this port and with facili
ties for coaling there it would mean no
small advantage to them. By coaling
there from 300 to 400 more tons of
freight could be carried. Akun Island
is just inside Unimak pass and directly
in the line of Alaskan steamers. Coal
bunkers are to be erected there at once
and the necssity of carrying coal to
Dutch Harbor will no longer exist. Al
ready arrangements have !>â¢
with two of the largest companies to
coal there. The coal lands of the com
pany have a frontage of a mile and a
half on the water, and comprise 6-H
acres. The outcroppings are within
fifty feet of high tide. The aggregate
of true coal veins really workable to
gether is eight feet. The coal can be
put on ship, it is said, for $2 a ton.
The United States Government has
been investigating the Chignik find.
Should it be able to use the coal it will
obviate the necessity of battleships and
transports running down to Honolulu,
nearly 1000 miles out of their way, to
coal. Again, it would avoid the neces
sity of carrying the large quantities of
coal to Dutch Harbor for Government
use in coaling the Bering Sea patrol
fleet, as is done every year.
A. E. Diekerman, the mining expert
of the Chignik Company, will leave for
the mines on Friday by the steamer
Cottage City, taking with him a force
of men to commence development, and,
incidentally, take out 3500 tons that
have been contracted for.

THAT TOUR OF CUBA
Has Left Washington at a Critical
Time, and His Absence is
Significant.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
NEW YORK, March 38.â A special to
the Journal from .Washington says:
Has Secretary of War Russell Alg-er
given up the direction of affairs in the
War Department?
That he has is th* belief of well
posted authorities in Washington, and
his absence in Cuba at this critical
juncture gives plausibility to the re
port that he- will not much longer be
a factor in the Cabinet.
The Secretary is in Cuba on what is
termed by courtesy "a tour of inspec
tion," but those who adhere to the
theory that he has been compelled by
the administration-managers to practi
cally relinquish everything but his title,
point to. the fact that he is touring
through Cuba, where there is no pros*
pect nf a fight, and that he left here
at a time when the situation at Manila,
was the absorbing question. â 
It is said that the conferences at
Thomasville were uniformly unfavora
ble to Alger, and that the President
was informed that .Vigor's retention in
the Cabinet was the greatest danger
now menacing the Republicans in the
n< xt campaign.
The powers of which Secretary Alger
appears to have been divested â 
shared equally by Acting Sec'ri
Meiklejohn and Adjutant General
bin.
Secretary Alger, it is said. m;<y
resign for some time because thus
he ha"s ignored all hims from th
ministration that such a course .
meet unqualified approval, but it si â 
certain that he has relegated to subor
dinate officials the practical direction <âº:'

THE ACCOUNTS OF
THOS. BONNEAU
Former Clerl^ of Marin County
Pays in Money to Cover
a Shortage.
SAX RAFAEL., March 29.â Despite strenuous efforts on the part of tha
county officials to prevent the affair becoming public property it has
been discovered that ex-County Clerk Thomas Bonneau is short in his
accounts under circumstances of so unfortunate a nature that on next Mon
day the matter will probably be drawn to the attention of the Board of
Supervisors. For twelve years Bonneau filled the office of County Clerk
so creditably that he made a host >f friends, few of whom will refuse to
abide by his explanation that the shortage was due to mistakes in the bal
ancing of accounts.
At the last election Bonneau was defeated at the polls by Robert E.
Graham, and Eugene Connell was elected Auditor and Recorder.
Marriage licenses are always procured from the County Clerk and a fee
of $2 charged, one-half of which is paid into the Recorder's office when the
certificate of marriage is recorded. It is in the marriage license department
that the shortage exists and on account of their intimate connection in this
regard the mistake came to light in the Recorder's office in a rather pe
culiar way.
A few days ago a marriage certificate was brought into Connell's office
to be recorded. The license had been issued months ago, during Bon
neau's Incumbency, and Connell went into Clerk Graham's office for the
Recorder's fee of $1. There he found that no money had been turned over
by Bonneau to Graham when the office changed hands. Mystified at this
discovery. Connell made an examination of the County Clerk's marriage
license register and upon comparison with the books of his own office found
that from the years 1655 to 1898 inclusive about 130 licenses had been issued
without any fee being 1 paid into the Recorder's office. A further examin
ation showed that there were 'certain discrepancies in the books which ap
peared at a cursory glance to have been the result of design.
Recorder Connell immediately drew the facts to the attention of Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac. That official investigated and sent for Bonneau.
When he learned of the discrepancy in his accounts Bonneau said it must be
the result of clerical errors, and as an evidence of his pood intention he
hired William Dougherty at his own expense to expert the books. Dough
erty found that Recorder Connell was correct in his figures, whereupon
Bonneau paid the balance due the Recorder's office.
If the Supervisors accept Bonneau's statement as trueâ and it !s the
opinion of the officials cognizant of the facts that such will be the caseâ
tho matter will be permitted to rest where it is; otherwise the affair will
necessarily be drawn to the attention of the Grand Jury.
SAMOANS UNDER
MSTAAFA ATTACK
THE FOREIGNERS
Continued From First Page.
British cruisers Porpoise and Royalist
had bombarded the towns held by Ma
taafa, who has thus far had the offi
cial support of the German Govern
ment, came with startling suddenness
to officials here and displaced for the
time being the attention given to the
fighting around Manila. The shelling
of Mataafa was looked upon as of sec
ondary Importance, but the deepest in
terest is attached to the attitude of the
German Government.
At first apprehensions were felt that
grave International complications
might ensue. But those most intimate
ly familiar with the latest official ex
changes between Washington, London
and Berlin did not take such a gloomy
View of the outlook. While recogniz
ing that the bloodshed at Samoa creat
ed a very serious and delicate situa
tion, it was said to be a situation which
had been clearly apprehended and dis
cussed in advance between the repre
sentatives of the three Governments.
The real crisis, from an international

and the attacks on the several Con
sulates.
These all involve unknown possibili
ties of serious complications. While
they had been guarded against as far
as possible by the recent anticipatory
exchanges, yet it was felt that the Ger
man press and national sentiment
might be wrought to a high pitch by
the events which had occurred and that
this outburst of popular feeling might
overcome the strong efforts of officials
oounS th Â° SUbJ6Ct Within Dacific
In an authoritative quarter thÂ» atti
tude of the British and American Con
suls was stated substantially as fol
lows:
It was actually understood between
the two Governments that the fir*t es
sential in Samoa was to maintain peace
and order. For that reason it was de
termined that any lawlessness on the
part of the Mataafa or any other Sa
moan element which threatened the
lives or property of residents would be
suppressed, even though force was re
quired. This was entirely without ref
erence to the rights of the three Gov
ernments-Great Britain, the United
States and Germanyâ and was merely
a rule of preservation and police secur
ity. Acting on this understanding Can
tain Sturdee of the Porpoise gave no
tice some time ago that he would bom
bard the Mataafans if there was any
outbreak or disorder. This insured ouiet
for a time, but he has always been
ready to use force if it was necessary
It was not proposed to give Samoa over
to a reign of anarchy simply because
the German Consular official at Samoa
differed with the British and American
officials. Outside of these differences
it was proposed to protect life and
property at all hazards. When Ad
miral Kautze went to Samoa he also
had Instructions that his first duty was
to protect life and property and to
maintain order. It is evident that the
bloodshed has arisen out of this united
effort of the American and British
commanders to protect the law-abiding
and peaceful elements against the dis
orderly and rebellious subjects of Ma
taafa. This is evidenced by Mataafa's
action in hemming in the town where
the American and British officials re
sided; also in the attacks on the Con
sulate and in the general lawlessness
which has prevailed since Mataafa be
gan his reign.
In short, according to the view of

LOS ANGELES, March 29.â Special- thanksgiving services held from
2 to 4 o'clock this afternoon in the Young Men's Christian Association
Auditorium were devoted to prayer of thanks for the recent rainfall
Rev. Hugh R. Walker spoke of the late rains as having been sent in

LOST MAN FOUND
BY BLOODHOUNDS
Successful Search Near
San Diego.
DEMENTED TOURIST RESCUED
HAD STRAYED FROM A TRAIN
AT OCEANSIDE.
Aged Traveler Who Wandered Into
the Brush Proves to Be a
Resident of Silver
City, N. M.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Cail.
SAN DIEGO, March 29.âBloodhounds
have found the old man who left the
train at Oceanside on Monday after
noon in a demented condition while en
route to this city. He has since been
identified by papers found in his pock
ets as M. K. White of Silver City, N.
M. He was brought to this city this
afternoon by Constable Hubbert of
Oceanside. Up to a late, hour his rela
tives, if he has any in this vicinity,
had not been found, but the old man
will be cared for until taken in charge
by his family.
The search was begun at the request
of Conductor Clegg of the Southern
California Railroad soon after the man
left the train at Oceaneide. The trav
eler appeared to be demented and his
actions in Oceanside left that impres
sion with those to whom he talked. He
was in that town only an htrur or two
before he started out into the country,
and before sunset two constables of
Oceanside had been informed by Con
ductor Clegg that the man was trying
to get to San Diego and they were on
the way tcr find him. Their search
Monday afternoon was unsuccessful
and yesterday afternoon they started
out again, taking along two blood
hounds owned by Constable Hubbert.
The dogs took the scent quickly and !
led the officers a chase through the
brush of San Luis Rey Valley and over
the hills in the roughest part of that sec
tion. The trail was almost in the form I
of a circle. Just before dark last night j
the officers saw a man about a mile â 
ahead, and by taking a short cut across i
the country came up to him in advance i
of the do-gs.
The terribleexperience passed through I
by the old man since leaving Oceanside
thirty-six hours before was shown in
his appearance, his clothes being in
rags and his hands covered with cuts
and bruises. He greeted the officers
pleasantly, and, in answer to a ques
tion, told his name and place of resi
dence. He insisted, however, that his
home was just beyond an adjacent hill.
He was persuaded tv accompany his
rescuers back to Oceanside, a distance
of eight miles, though he had traveled
about twenty in his wanderings.
The man, who appears to be about 63
years old, had nothing to eat from the
time he left Oceanside until found by
the officers. One of his hallucinations
waa that his spectacles were in his
mouth, and it was only after an in
spection had been made by the officers
that he came to the conclusion that the
spectacles had been lost and were not
hidden in his mouth. He was brought
to this city this afternoon and will be j
cared for. Among other papers in his j
pockets was a round-trip ticket from
Silver City to Wan Diego.
â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢â¢
those best acquainted with the subject,
the British and American case will rest
upon the paramount necessity of pre
serving peace and order.
The German view, it can be stated on
very eminent authority, is not likely
to raise a direct issue on the position
thus laid down by the British and
American officials. On the contrary,
there is said to be a growing disposi
tion on the part of Germany to hold
Herr Rose accountable for the difficul
ties in which he has involved his Gov
ernment. For a time he was sustained,
with the natural desire to protect him
in the proper discharge of his duties,
but the German authorities have not
contemplated that he would carry the
matter to an open rupture, with the
resulting bloodshed. On that account
there is good reason to beileve that the
German Government will not sustain
Herr Rose and that official information
in that direction has already been con
veyed.
The diplomatic exchanges leading up
to this crisis have been very sharp
within the last few days. Early last
week the Berlin Government received
direct information from Samoa that
Admiral Kautz had arrived there and
had summoned a meeting of all the offl
i cials for March 11. The German au
thorities felt sure this meeting would
result in serious trouble. The Berlin
Foreign Office therefore instructed the
German Embassador here. Dr. yon Ho-1
leben. to present a note embodying
Germany's views. It argued that a
naval commander had no right to act
save in executing the will of the three
Consuls, acting unanimously and not
\ through a majority. But. aside from
I this argument, the German note inti
i mated quite plainly that Germany
would hold the other governments re
i sponsible if serious trouble resulted
from the action of the naval authori
ties in Samoa.
The strained conditions caused by this
! note were somewhat allayed by the
| answer of the State Department, which
; was friendly and reassuring, although
! it made it plain that the American
! naval commander would act in an
j emergency, even though the Consuls
I were not unanimous in requesting ac
j tion. It is just such an emergency that
has now occurred in Samoa.
There is no apprehension here that an
I actual clash will occur with the German
i civil or naval forces in Samoa. This is
| due mainly to the official understanding
J that Germany has given positive orders
JEWISH COLONIAL TRUST
FORMED TO ORGANIZE A
STATE IN PALESTINE
NEW YORK, March 29.â 1n pur
suance of resolutions adopted at
the Zionist Congress in Basle,
Switzerland, in August of last
year a subscription list was
opened to-day in Lojidon and New
York for a Jewish colonial trust, which
is to be established with a preliminary
capital "of $10,000,000 to conduct the
financial operations of the Zionist
movement.
The subscription list will remain open
for a month, in which time it is ex
pected the capital will be subscribed
many times over. The trust is to be
known on the continent of Europe as
the Jewish Colonial Bank, limited. The
preliminary capital of $10,000,000, which
it is intended shall be increased later
to $50,000,000, Is to be divided into 1,999.
--900 ordinary shares of $5 each and 100
"founders' " shares, also of $5 each. The
founders' shares are to be held jointly
by members of the council and their
nominees, and while. they will not par
ticipate in the profits of the bank, their
holders will in all matters affecting en
terprises to advance the Zionist move
ment have an equal voting power to
that of all other shareholders present
at any general meeting. The purpose
of this provision is to prevent the trust
from being turned from its primary ob
ject, that of aiding and promoting Zion
ism into purely commercial channels.
In New York the trust will be repre
sented by the American Federation of
Zionists of 20 Broad street, of which
Professor Richard Gotthel of Columbia
University is president and Rabbi
Stephen S. Wise of the Madison-avenue
Synagogue secretary. Applications for
shares should be made to the federa
tion.
Dr. Wise, when asked to-day about
the company, said that its purpose was
primarily to finance Jewish industrial
and commercial enterprises in Palestine
and Syria after certain restrictions now
in force as to Jewish Immigration have
been removed by the Sultan. It will also
occupy itself in obtaining the removal
of these restrictions and will provide
backing for several Turkish enterprises.
"The purpose of the Zionist move
| ment," Dr. Wise said, "is^o establish
j a Jewish state In Palestine, of course.
i under suzerainty of the Sultan, but
? with its stability guaranteed by Euro
i pean powers. The Sultan is friendly
to the project, for he realizes how much
! the wealth and resources of his em
j pire would be increased by such a
I state. We expect as soon as the neces
to the commander of the German war
ship Falke to refrain from any active
move.
GERMAN AND BRITISH
NEWSPAPER COMMENT
LONDON, March 30.â The morning
papers comment on the serious news
from Samoa, the presumption being
that the cruiser Tauranga was stopped
at the Fiji Islands by the admiral be
cause required for service at Samoa.
The Standard says: "The rebellious
chiefs must be coerced and punished,
and something more than a nominal
penalty will ba required for the blood
of British an*' American sailors. The
German authorities at Apia have in
curred a heavy responsibility. We can
not believe that Berlin will uphold
their action, as it is not worth Ger
many's while to quarrel with England
and America over Samoa." .
The Daily Chronicle says: "There is
only one alternative: Germany must
remove her Consul (Herr Rose) or go
out of the protectorate."
The Morning Post, commenting upon
the mystery surrounding the affair and
the impossibility of reconciling the
! events in Samoa with diplomatic as
; surances lately given by Berlin and
Washington, says: "Admiral Kautz
i and his coadjuters were not competent
! to dismiss the provisional government.
i The single bright spot in this dark busi
ness is that the Americans and British
fought splendidly together."
The Daily Mall says: "It is a conso
i lation to think that, as in Crete, the
I spilling of the American and British
blood will bring a solution of the crisis.
All three powers should recall their
Consuls and as the friendship of Ger
many is the pivot of our foreign policy,
her wishes should be respected "in the
final settlement."
BERLIN, March 30.â The Neueste
Nachrichten, which disapproves the at
titude of the Jingo papers in accusing
the Government of a lack of vigor re
garding Samoan affairs, says: "Ger
many's position In Europe is not so se
cure that any strength should be
wasted in an attempt to treat trans
oceanic problems in accordance with
the dictates of.a lively political fancy."
DR. SOLF ORDERED
TO APIA AT ONCE
LONDON, March 30.â The Berlin cor
respondent t^f the Standard sars: "Dr.
Solf, while in London, had several con
ferences, I learn here, with Mr. Cham
berlain on the Samoan question. He
started for his now post yesterday. He
would have remained longer in London,
but the Government ordered him to pro
ceed immediately by way of Washing
ton in order to confer with tht Ameri
can authorities."
BERLIN, March 29.â The Hamburg
ische Correspondenz, dealing with the
question of installing Dr. Solf, who will
succeed Dr. Joannes Raffel as president
of the municipality of Apia, in the ab
sence of a generally recognized Samoan
Government, says: "The three powers
have arranged that the German, Brit
ish and American Consuls are to install
the new president of the municipality."
THE TONGA ISLANDS
WILL BE BRITISH
TONGA ISLANDS. TMarch 23 (via
Auckland, N. Z., March 29).â The Brit
ish cruiser Tauranga arrived here on
March 7 under sealed orders on a secret
mission.
It is surmised that her visit was the
result of rumors of an intended Ger
man annexation, the cruiser aiming to
secure an agreement that if any na
tion is to annex the Tonga Islands it
shall be England.
The captain of the Tauranga before
leaving, on March 18. said he had ac
complished his mission satisfactorily
and that the German incident had
been overatted, the German claims
being trifling except as to the right to
a coaling station in the island of
Vavao. It is doubtful whether the
German Consul intends to proceed even
with this.
Takes a Dose of Strychnine.
SANTA ROSA. March 29.â C. H. Schief

county, is believed to have taken an over
dose of strychnine this evening, from the
effects of which he died a few hours later.
He leaves a family, of twelve children.

here all day to-day arranging the final
details of the agreement between the
growers and packers, and reorganizing
the association. The agreement be- I
tween the packers and growers was j
agreed upon by M, Theo. Kearney, rep
resenting the growers, and W. M. Grif
fin on behalf of the packers. It covers
the following points:
The whole crop to be assigned to pack

raisins as fast as they are delivered. The
association must fix prices. All â¢ raisins
OIUSt be sold for cash. There will be no
restrictions as to the quantity that may

These provisions will enable the as
sociation to pay the growers for their
raisins as fast as they can deliver
them. A further stipulation has been
made that the packers must pay for all
of the raisins for which they subscribe
prior tv January 15. The price for
packing will remain the same as set

CURRENCY MEASURE
WILL BE DRAFTED
INDIANAPOLIS, March 29. âH. H.
Hanna, rhairman of the executive com

a meeting of the executive committee to
be held in New York City April 7 and 8.
The Hon. John P. Irish Is a member of
tho committee for California.
The Republican caucus of the late Con
gress appointed a committc-p to consider
the currency and banking problems of the

The call for the meeting of the execu

purpose of arranging forconstiltation with

CASE OF TAXATION WITHOUT

After the Elective House Has De
feated the Measure the Gov
ernor Declares It in.
Operation.
Special Correspondence of the Associated Pratt,
KINGSTON, Jamaica, March 22.â The
political crisis in Jamaica that was
foretold in the Associated Press dis
patch of February '21 has developed.
The colony entered the acute stage yes
terday evening, and what the next
week or day may bring forth it would
need a wise prophet to forecast.
The Legislative Council met on March
14, and the Governor's address proved,
apparently, a most conciliatory mani
festo to the people. The papers ac
cepted it with joy. Within twenty-four
hours, however, it turned out to be
waste paper. At the next day's session
the Government introduced a new tariff
bill making drastic innovations, taxing
many necessities and putting on the
free list many luxuries.
The elective House declined to dis
cuss the bill, of which it had no notice,
and by a unanimous vote threw out the
first reading. By a quibble the Gov
ernor ruled that the bill from that mo
ment went into operation, adjourned
the council until March 22 (to-day) and
instantly convened the Privy Council,
which sustained his ruling and ordered
the new tariff in immediate operation,
concurrently with the existing one,
which expires March 31.
This act caused a commotion in com
mercial circles. The general public was
not less excited. The newspapers, in
cluding the Gleaner, perhaps one of the
most conservative and non-committal
papers In the British colonies, raved
and prophesied no end of evil.
It was understood, up to yesterday,
that the elected members had deter
mined unanimously to. block all further
business until the Government yielded
to their constitutional right to accept
or reject financial measures and with
draw the outrageous ruling, as they ex
pressed it, by which the new tariff had
been forced on the country.
The Governor yesterday evening took
steps to block this programme. He is
sued a proclamation proroguing the
Council and another convening it to
meet to-day at 2 o'clock. At the same
time he issued a manifesto declaring
that with concurrence and under the In
structions of Mr. Chamberlain, he
would by this step be enabled to re
introduce the tariff bill and carry it
through, taking such steps as are nec
essary, and as he is authorized by the
constitution to take, to secure that ob
ject.
This means just what was forecasted
on reliable information in the dispatch
of February 21 and toward which the
Government has been workingâ that is,
the numerical increase of the official
side so as to outvote the electives and
force Government measures against
which the representatives are unani
mous.
The tariff bill thus passed, a crown
colony bill is expected to follow, to be
similarly forced through. To meet this
crisis, it is this morning reported, it
was at a private meeting of the repre
sentatives last night unanimously de
cided that if the Government brings in
new official members an<J declines to
withdraw the new tariff- altogether,
they will resign their seats in a body,
thus compelling an appeal to the voters.
Freight Train Wrecked.
SACRAMENTO, March 29.â A special
freight train of seven cars was wrecked

WHY HAS HUDYAN SUCH WON-
DERFUL CURATIVE POWERS?
The question is readily explained by
this fact: Hudyan goes to the bottom
of the disease and exerts its curative
influence there.
Many remedies relieve symptoms
only. When we take into consideration
that different maladies present similar
symptoms, we can easily understand
that such remedies do not cure. The
great Hudyan is unlike such remedies,
for it seeks out the cause of your symp-
toms.
Hudyan contains curative powers pe-
culiar to itself. Organic and functional
diseases readily yield to Hudyans in-
fluence.
Every man or woman who is reduced
in strength will find a powerful restor-
ative in Hudyan.
Hudyan corrects the faults of diges-
tion and gives healthful activity to the
liver and kidneys.
Those persons who suffer from Head-
ache, Dizzy Spells. Poor Memory,
Sleeplessness, Irritability of Temper,
Melancholy and other symptoms due
to a worn-out nervous system, will find
immediate relief in Hudyan.
Hudyan is an invaluable remedy for
Constipation, Biliousness, Torpid Liver,
Pain in Stomach. Shortness of Breath,
Palpitation of Heart, Coated Tongue,
etc.
Hudyan reconstructs broken-down
tissues. It attacks impure germs that
gather in the blood, and by stimulating
certain organs to proper activity it
drives these impurities from the sys-
tem.
Hudyan makes pure, rich blood, from
which come both mental and bodily
strength.
HUDYAN CURES ALL DISEASES
OF TH r ] STOMACH. LIVER, KID-
NEYS, NERVOUS SYSTEM, BLOOD.

EAGAN CURSED VOLUNTEERS
AND WOULD HAVE FORCED
THEM TO ACCEPT BAD BEEF
r WASHINGTON. March 29.â The |
: \ A / Array Beef Court of Inquiry
1/ I / had former Commissary Gen- |
U y era! Eagan before it to-day on I
recall, and also heard the testi
mony of Rear Admiral Stewart
and Paymaster Colby of the navy and
Major Black and Captain Pomeroy, vol
unteer officers, who were engaged in the
commissary service at Ponce during Gen
eral Milts' Porto Rican campaign.
â¢General Kagan's testimony was not
startling. He stated that Messrs. Ar
| mour & Co. had put in a bid to supply \
| beef to be preserved by a process of theiv I
J own, but that he had not considered it. !
There was an apparent effort on the j
part of Major Lee, representing General j
Miles, to show that Senator Hanna had
sought to influence the contracts, but
General Eagan asserted that he did not
know the Senator.
Captain Pomeroy stated that of 21,000
pounds of beef receipted for at Ponce,
Porto Rico, 6000 pounds had been con
demned.
Major Black told of a conversation with
General Eagan in regard to the refrig
erated beef, in which he quoted the latter
' as saying with an oath that he would
have compelled the men to take the beef.
Rear Admiral Edwin Stewart was the first j
witness. He stated that canned rcast beef was
j one of the articles of food' used by the navy,
and explained in detail the careful inspection
; that .-..- demanded by the department regula
j tions. Occasionally the beef, when delivered,
! would be found to be unsatisfactory, and it
| would then be rejected. He stated the aver
age purchases of food of this character for the
' nary to be 500,000 pounds per year, '.he pur- Â
chases being reade through the New York
representatives of Armour & Co., Nelson Morris
& Co. and other firms. The canned beef Was a
portion of the regular navy ration and very
little of it was ever condemned.
Paymaster Henry G. Colburn, assistant chief
of the Bureau of Supplies of the Navy Depart
ment, also testified concerning the use of
canned roast beef in the navy. He stated that
where any questions arose as to the quality of
beef It was submitted to chemical analysis.
The navy had found that the canned beef kept
well at sÂ«i. and in some cases it was held from j
year to year.
Major John D. Blark, who was chief com- j
missary on General Miles' staff during the j
Porto- Rican campaign, was asked by Major |
LÂ»ee to detail a conversation he had with Gen- i
eral Eagan. at that time commissary general. j
after hiÂ« < Black's) return to Washington last i
fall. The statement he made proved to be a
somewhat sensational one.
'â¢I called upon General Eagan." Major Black
began by saying, "to confer with him concern
ing the conduct of our affairs at Ponce. He
asked me why the refrigerator beef was r.ot j
Issued at Ponce, and I replied that it was be-- !
cause the issue commissaries did net want it.
as they were getting native beef. Thereupon
General Eagan became very much excited and
exclaimed: ' them, they'have no right
to refuse it. I consider it the best beef in the
United States, and them, I'd have j
made them take it.' "
Captain Fred H. Pomeroy. also ft! vol
unteer subsistence department, who was for a
time Major Black's assistant in Ponce.' related
the particulars of the return of the Manitoba
to Ponce after visiting other departments. He
was at that time depot commissary, sr.d dur- j

of which 6<XK) pounds was destroyed. Much of I
the beef was covered with a greenish film. !

they .generally complained of the beef. Much j
of it was found to be tainted, decomposed and i

at night. At this time fresh native beef -was
being received on th? hoof, and at many points
Inland native beef is. Captain Pomeroy said,
still being delivered.
The afternoon session began with General
Charles I* Eagan, late commissary general at
the United States army, on . the stand. He
was recalled to take cognizance of points which
have developed since he gave his first testi
mony. General Eagan said that he had had
conversations with the representatives of Swift
&â  Co. prior to the letting of the beef con
tracts, but as he had also talked with others
on the same subject he could not recall the
details of his remarks. He remembered that
Mr. Swift had taken exception to some of the
terms of the first ' draft of the contract as
being very harsh. Explaining his plans In gen
eral. General Eagan said it was his first in
tention to take refrigerator beef, tnen In case
of failure to take beef on the block and last
for the Government to have its own herd.
Everybody, he thought, understood that his
preference was for the refrigerator beef. Swift
& Co. being the lowest bidders for the refriger
ator beef, natura-v received the award of the
contract. Referring' to the term? of the con
tract. General Eagan said that the matt of
supplying the army with beef was considered
from the beginning a very serious problem. He
had first thought of having ships ply .-.-. and
down the Cuban shore, and it was with this
In view that he decided to ask for bee' that
would keep seventy-two iKsurs. - He. had also
felt that mere would be difficulty, in landing
at Santiago. His principal reason ft>r insert-
Ing the clause stipulating that the beef should
be good twenty-four hours after leaving the
refrigerator ivas that he did not wish the
troops to know that the -contract called for
beef that would keep severity-two hours for
fear that it would no; keep so long.
When cross-examinr.ed by Major L>>. General
Eagan said he exercised his own discretion in
the letting- cf contracts without suggestions
from the Secretars' of War. When the lowest
bid was ascertained he had been in the. habit
of making an abstract of the fact and submit
ting it to the Secretary, just as when he was
a commissary in the army he would furnish
such an abstract to his commanding officer.
The general mid thai in providing for the sol
diers In the tropics he had acted upon his ex
perience at Fort Mojave, Arizona. He was con
vinced from this experience that beef cooked
before the animal heat was out of it was
positively injurious. He recalled his conversa
tion with Mr. Gardner. Of the firm of Swift &
Co.. who, he said, had assured him that with
proper tare refrigerator beef would keep sev
enty-two hours. He was. however, doubtful of
the" care the array would give it if it was
known the beef would keep seventy-two
hours, hence his agreement to the insertion Of
the twenty-four hour clause.
"Did you understand it was to keep In good
condition twenty-four hours after being taken
from live ship refrigerator?" asked Major Lee.
"Yes, â¢ sir, that was . the understanding,"
General Eagan responded, promptly. Here he
again referred to tne twenty-four hour clause,
explaining that his whole idea was that there
should be a seventy-two' hour time limit,
though the contract should state it at twenty
four. The retention bo strongly of the seventy
two hours idea in tils mind explained his for
getfulness of the twenty-four clause in giving
his testimony on a, previous occasion and his
statement then that its insertion was -a. clerical
error. Major Lee asked the general if he
thought it perfectly feasible to keep refrigera
tor beef for even twenty-four hours after leav
ing the refrigerator, and he replied in the af
firmative.
â¢"But not," he said, "if left in the open sun
or dumped in dirty carts, as it was in some in
stances."
General Eagan said he had secured the opin
ion of the surgeon general that refrigerator beef
was most acceptable. He had never had any
idea that the troops could be better supplied
by giving them beef on the loot. He had no
recollection that the Secretary of War had sug
gested to him that the refrigerator beef should
be taken from Armour of Swift merely as â  a
trial, being convinced of its superiority over
all other beef.
"The Secretary gave me a free hand," he
said. "He approved my award of the contract,
and there-was no further conference with him
or instructions from him on the beef subject."
Referring to General Westoa'l report i.ii the
trial of the Powell process for preserving beef
made in Florida, General Eagan said a report
had been received on this subject from General
Weston, but that he (Eagan) had not known of |
its purport until long after the contract was let
to Swift & Co. He recalled a letter he had
written to Alexander B. Powell, May 26. re
garding .-:.- process. He also stated that he
had heard that Powell had ! Induced Swift or
Armour to investigate the process, and some
of the bide-: proposed to use it. But he gave
the subject no attention.
* "For that matter," he continued, "there was j
a great deal of talk about the Powell and other i
processes about the department, but not on my ;
part, as I did not propose that any but the best
frozen beef, such as is used in, the best hotels,
should be eaten by the army."
"Do you recall," asked Major Lee, "being
present when a conversation took place con
cerning the letting of these contracts when
Senator Hanna was present?"
"I never spoke to Senator Banna in my life."
responded General Eagan, "and I don't think
I aid know him If he should step into the
room now."
"But." persisted Major Lee, ''were you ever
present where he was when the beef contracts
were discussed?"
"I recall." was the reply, "that the Secre
tary sent for" me on one occasion and asked
nit- about the contracts when there were two
other gentlemen present in the room with him
' I stated to him that the contracts ' ad already
been let and that nothing more could be done.
But if Senator Hanna was one of the men
prtsent, I was not aware, of the fact."
Explaining the purchases of the canned roast
beef. General Eagan said that during the en
tire war not to exceed twenty four days' ra
tlons all told of it for the entire army had
teen issued. It was only intended as a make
shift to be used when fresh moat could not
be secured
"Seme reports favorable to it and others un
favorable came to me concerning it." he ?Ald.
"There were some complaints and some com
mendations."
Continuing, he said that he had attributed
the objections to this food largely to the is- i
norance ar.d prejudice of the men. "which i
has," he said, "been the cause of the arjny's
refusing many wholesome articles of food."
Sickness among the troops had also doubt
less much to do in influencing the objections j
to this meat, according to the opinion of the
witness. General Eajran said he had had many
conversations with men professing to repre
sent the Texas cattle interests, who wanted to
furnish beef on the hoof, but he did not recall
expressing the opinion that beef on the hoof j
or on the block would be the best form In
which to pet meat for the army. It was per
fectly well understood at all times that he
preferred refrigerator beef He remembered !
that he had forbidden his office to one of these !
men cause of his persistence. He thought â¢
he had mentioned the Powell proposition to
preserve beef to some of the beef men, but
had only done so casually, and then only be
cause many of them thought the beef could
not be kept seventy-two hours. As for him- \
self, he would not touch the process, nor
would he have accepted any bid In which the |
bidder depended upon a process other than !
freezing or chilling the beef.
In this connection General Eagan said that
Armour & Co had put in a bid for "processed
beef," but it was not accepted, and he did
not remember the details concerning it. This
bid was made in the letting of the contracts
for beef for Cuba and Porto Rico. He knew
nothing of the secret of .the procesi and had
given the matter no "attention. '
"I derided to give the contract to the lowest
responsible bidder and stopped at that," be
paid. "I took r.o interest whatever in the
FUbjeot of the process." he repeated. He :
thought the bid could be obtained at the com
missary general's office and recommended that
it be procured for the exact facts.
The witness said he had conversed with nei
ther General Miles nor General Shatter con
cerning the army rations, but that General
Brooke had made some recommendations con
cerning bacn in can?. With this. General
Eaean's testimony closed and the court ad
journed for the day with the understanding
that some witnesses in General Miles' behalf
would be beard to-morrow.

Our â Climate and Schiller are the only
ones saved from the burning wreck of
Dan Honlg-'s horsecar in Southern Califor
nia. Both of the horses mentioned Jumped
from the car without suffering Injury.
Schiller is still roaming on the desert, but
Our Climate was caught. The stable
hands claim that no- bell cord passed
through the car, and that the fire was
burning fully fifteen minutes before the
train could be stopped.
Burns & Waterhouse yesterday pur
chased Dr. Sheppard of Fred Foster.
Terms private.
Bookmaker Johnny Coleman took .4.
long, hard fall out of Peixotto, and in this
particular instance was followed by Joe
Rose. Only a day or two ago, it is
claimed from reliable sources, the sprint
er worked six furlongs in 1:15 flat with 120
pounds on his back. Strangely enough
though, yesterday his owner did not par
ticularly fancy the animal's chances. He
was ridden by Charley Gray. Columns
have been written about Gray's honesty,
yet it is remarkable what liberties certain
bookmakers take with some of his
mounts. Dr. Rowell once tried to look
after Gray's Interests, but the doctor ear
ly became disinterested. For what reason
was never made known.
Another jockey' that is handled with un
dressed kid gloves is Ivy Powell: If he
losesâ so and so had him, the gossips say.
Ask "so and so" what he did to that race,
and the penciler will say. "Lose $860 to
it." Powell is an air-tight, unassuming
little fellow, rides few winners, dresses
well, always has natty looking "tackle"
and is probably misjudged. He is a young
hand at the business, and no doubt many
of his hard luck "cut-offs" on short
priced horses are due to lack of judgment,
He- can ride a swell race on an outsider,
and in time track nervousness will wear
off and he will do equally well on favor
ites.
The Corrigan people are badly fooled
over the performance of Alary's Garter.
Over at Ingleside a few days ago the filly
was beaten out during- a workout in a
gallop by a maiden two-year-old, and she
was sent over to Oakland for the native
sons to bet on, the smart money going in
on Ramboulia.

!i6 s Eeurny St., San Francisco. CÂ«LSCHOOL BOARD AGAIN
WIELDS THE AX WITH
DEPRESSING EFFECT
Many More Teachers Decapitated
and Salaries of Others Receive
Slight Cuts.
DIRECTOR HEAD WAS VERY WARM
He Strongly Objected to the Will of the
Committeeâ Teachers to Be Tried for
Incompetency.
THE spirit of economy has again taken possession of the members
of the Board of Education, judging- by the manner in which they
decapitated teachers and reduced salaries. Teachers in the Mission
High and the Business Evening schools suffered the loss of their posi
tions and were placed on the waiting list, the vice principal of the Mis
sion High School lost her title and fhe various janitresses in the de
partment suffered a cut in their monthly pay.
An unusual amount of business was
transacted at the meeting of the
Board of Education last night. Im
â¢ mediately after the reading of com
munications the board resolved itself in
to a committee of the whole and went
Into executive session. For an hour it
debated over a multitude of business and
on its return to the meeting room reso
lution, on resolution was put through
with great rapidity. Chairman Stow of
the committee :of the whole met a de
termined opponent in Director Head,
who was seconded by Director Gedge.
The latter two declined to enter into the
deliberations of the committee, well
knowing what the programme was.
"While their fellow members were in sea
sion Director Head was heard to say
that he know what they were going to
do in executive session and did not want
to bind himself to their decisions. Later
lie and Director Gedge aid enter the
closed doors, and on their advent at the
conclusion of the meeting it was appar
. Nt that both were dissatisfied with the
actions decided on by the majority of
the board.
Their dissatisfaction was not voiced un
til Chairman Stow came to that portion
of the committee's report bearing on the
reclassincation of the Mission High
School. Director Head asked that the
matter be explained, and President Ber
geron seeing that a quarrel was immi
nent, tried to smooth it over with his own
explanation. Â , .
Chairman Stow heatedly replied that he
thought the whole matter had been dis
cussed during the executive session of
the committee if the whole.
Head answered that he knew nothing
about such a committee, and warmly
stated he had a right to make such a re

â¢'Tarn now thirty-sit years old and have given
birth to ten children. Eight only are living. I
hare twin boys six years old. The same spring
after they we're born I was confined to nty bed
- Â«:i ->ring and summer with female complaint;
jjo â¢ it so badly I could hardly walk around the
house without feeling worse. I was restless at
nitrhf sleep almost left me. and I was almost a
Skeleton. I did not call my doctor as I had tried
the doctors twice before when -I was dowu with
the same trouble, and my husband paid out a
eTcat deal for me. I received no lasting benefit;
I had almost lost all hope of ever, being able to
do anything. My husband had to work very
hard and I could not even attend to the babies.
No one can know the distress of my mind as
veil as body Dr. Pierre's Favorice Prescription
was the only medicine that seemed to do me any
good. After I had taken the first bottle and
Â«art of the second. I could sleep well and alt mv
{roubles began to get better. I believe I took
eight bottles and then I felt like a different
person I trave birth to another baby and my
z old complaint came back. I began using; the
' "Favorite Prescription' and was soon relieved
and was able to do my work, including the
washing." ' . â¢
Mothers would be immensely helped in
raising their children strong: and healthy

WINNERS OF
THE OLYMPIC
BOXING BOUTS
McCarthy Beat Ast in
a Hard Fight,
HILLMAN DEFEATED SNOOKER
LIGHTWEIGHTS FOUGHT WITH
VIM AND DASH.
Doc Flynn, the Blood-Maker, Whipped
Jack Dennis in One of the
Hardest Contests Seen
in the Club.
One of the most interesting: boxing
entertainments given by the Olympic
Club was witnessed last evening- by an
exceptionally large gathering of num
bers, among whom "the hissing" bri
gade was strongly represented.
The first event was a six-round bout
between the welter weights < 1-15 pounds),
Al Hillman of the Sacramento Athletic
club and A. Snooker of the Manhattan
Athletic Club. Snooker appeared much
lighter than his opponent, who could
easily pass for a middle-weight. Hillman
was the aggressor, but each time he
rushed al Sn ioker lie stopped a well di
rected lefthand lead with his nose. The
pace cut ou! by Hillman was a bit too
hoi for Snooker, who had bellows to
mend at the md ot the round. Hillman
won a k<">*l lead in the second, hi
ponent saving himself, from i knockout
by dodging around the ring and clinching;.
The third was tame, and in the fourth
Snooker went down twice and was al
most out of the race when the gong
sounded. In the tilth and sixth rounds
Hillman showed marked signs of
fatigue, and Snooker landed some clean
blows. The judges awarded the bout to
Hillman.
The second welter-weight event was a
hot six-round .contest between J. F. Mc-
Carthy of the Olympic Club and F. Ast
of the Manhattan Club. The first round
wag all in McCarthy's favor, but in the
second Ast warmed up to the game and |
r.-minded his opponent that the fun was
about to commence. Ah soon as the men
toed the scratch for the third round the j
Swede (Ast) stopped McCarthy's rushes
by swift right and left jabs in the face
and body. The exchanges were of the
warmest kind to the ilnish, when McCar
thy caught a hard right hander on the
jaw as the bell sounded. Ast had the
of the fourth, meeting his opponent
with stiff body punches which were tell
ing on McCarthy. The fifth was give and
take and both men felt the effects of
a hard bump on the Boor. The sixth was
very exciting. McCarthy kept pegging
away at Asts face, while the last named
boxer was painting McCarthy's body a
bright red. Just before the finish Me-
Carthy landed three hard smashes on
Asts face, which brought a liberal How of
claret from the Swedes hum-. McCarthy
won the decision amid a shower of hiss-s.
There was very little to choose between
the contestants. Still McCarthy had a
shade the best of it.
Joe Doyle, the elongated boxer of the
Olympic Club, won a decision over Shorty
Grossman of the Pan Rafael Athletic
Club. If Omssman had had a golf stick
hÂ»* might have reached Doyle's chin at
sume point in the game.
Steve Vicini, who was booked to box
Snooker, wa/l overweight, and Hillman
took his place.
The semi-finals of the lightweight class
(135 pounds) were the next on the pro
gramme.
John Kane of th*> Liberty Club faced
Dan Barry of the Manhattan Club. The
first round was evenly contested, but
When the boxers met in the second round
Kane, who was mure muscular than his
adversary, forced the fighting, and at
close range he certainly had the better
of the game. During a mixup near Bar
ry's comer Kane planted a hot right
hander on Barry's chin, which felled the
Manhattan man. who was apparently in
dreamland. Barry struggled to hi>
befert the tenth st con,] was shouted by
the referee, and Waf downed three times
but managed to keep on his pins until the
round was finished. His seconds seeing
that further fighting meant defeat to
Harry, throw up the sponge in favor of
Kane.
The next and final .-vent ot the even
ing was the most exciting of all the
bouts. It was a six-round "go" between
Jack Dennis of the Olympic Club and
"Doc" Flynn of the South Knd Rowing
Club. Flynn has a reputation for draw-
Ing blood in large quantities from the
men whom he has met rmd consequently
Dennis fought very carefully for a few
rounds. The lirst round was about half
over when in a mlxup Flynn smashed
Dennis with the heel of ITis risrht glove
over 'the left eye. cutting a deep gash
from which the claret Sowed liberally.
Tho second was rather tame, but the third
was a stem winder. Dennis was stung by
three or four uppercota in the fac â 
challenged Flynn to a rally at close
quarters. When the gloves were flying
Dennis happened to land a beauty left on
Flynn's chin and the blow had sufficient
steam in it to send th^ receiver to the
tldur. Flynn was up quickly and the
fight was fast and furious until the gong
for corners sounded. Dennis had the best
of this round.
The fourth, fifth and sixth were as ex
citing- as the most exacting: rlngster
could possibly desire. Tn straipht punch-
Ing Dennis senreu a lead, but Flynn got '
in the hardest blows by uppercutting :
Dennis with right and left each time the !
Olympic man clucked to avoid punish
ment. Flynn having had the best of the
first and second rounds, the judges gave
him the decision, which, however, dis
pleased a number of spectators. The en- '
tertalnment was. however, highly satis- ;
factory, it being the best of its kind wit- j
nessed by the members in many moons.
The judges were S. Carter and F. M.
Cerini and the referee was Al Smith.

AN EXCELLENT IDEA.
IT is to be hoped that some legal method will be
discovered by which the members of the late
Board of Education can be made financially re
isible for the deficit created in the school fund
. r their administration. If ever legal retribution
just it would be just in their cases. These men
the money intended for
salaries, and when it was found that neither
- with whom they had made contracts for
lies nor the teachers whom they had rleeced were
be paid they insolently swaggered out of
office and demanded of the people to know what they
-â ing to do about it.
I";. these men profited by their two
service in the School Department. The "rake
efts'' and "drawdowns" and "divvies" in which they
participated probably yielded them handsome divi
dends. The ringstcrs in one job alone must have
cleaned up several thousand dollars. We refer to the
oi the Lincoln School lot-, which was sold out
right. If some legal method of making their bonds
men responsible can be devised, not only will the
teachers recover a portion of their money, but a pre
cedent will be set at once valuable and instructive.
Each Schoci Director is under a bond of $5000.
The total for the twelve is $60,000, which would, if
collected, .give the school-teachers and merchants
about half of what is coming to them, provided the
bills of the latter were discounted 30 or 40 per cent.
It might be that a proceeding of this sort would take
in two or three School Directors in the late board
undeserving of castigation, but that would not be an
unmixed evil. It would teach respectable men to re
when in the future they become associated in
public office with thieves. As each School Director
is on his own borrd as principal, a judgment against
the bondsmen would cover whatever gains he may
have made during his term. Thus, if any one of the
late band of educational rascals has property it could
be taken from him and sold under execution.
The experiment is one well worth trying. . Not
only would it, if successful, serve as a lesson, but it
would give the school-teachers security for their
salaries, even against a band of thieves such as lately
nearly wrecked the School Department.
SENATE BILL NO. 202
IT is announced from Sacramento that Governor
Gage, out of the batch of bills left in his hands
upon the adjournment of the Legislature, has se
lected all he intends to sign and transmitted them to
the Secretary of State. It is further stated that he
has left the capital for a vacation and will not return,
although he has until to-night at midnight, under the
constitution, in which to make further selections.
Probably' the Governor thinks he has weeded out
and signed all the good bills, but there is at least one
still in his hands to which his attention ought to be
called, since he still has time to sign it. We refer to
Senate bill 202, which provides for a change in the
manner of impaneling Superior Court juries. This
measure has already been discussed in these columns,
and nothing remains except to call the Governor's at
tention to it and urge him to give it further considera
tion. The present method of selecting jurors in
courts of record in this State is loose and unman
ageable. It has bred a class called "professional
jurors," and by loosely delegating the power of se
lection has made jury-fixing possible, and as a con
sequence unjust verdicts are not infrequent.
Senate bill 202 will, if it become a law, abolish pro
fessional juryism, -and, by limiting the period of ser
vice and removing some of the objections business
men have to acting as jurors, attract to the box a
more reputable class.- The change has been indorsed
by the Bar Association, the County Clerk of this city
and county, many of the Superior Judges and re
spectable attorneys generally. The character of the
reform proposed by this measure will justify the
Governor in reconsidering his determination to sign
no more bills. The paramount duty of all citizens
is to aid in getting fair trials in the courts, for be it
known that liberty pines in those tribunals a long
time before she expires in its dungeons. Governor
Gage's responsibility at this juncture is greater than
that of most men, because he now possesses- the power
to give effect to a piece of legislation which will go a
long way toward making a change for the better.

AN EXPLOSIVE PARALLEL.
IN January, 1574. the grand commander of the
Spanish forces, Requescns, stood on the dike ot
Schakerloo to witness the departure ot a fleet
under Romero which was dispatched to relieve the
Spanish army, commanded by Mondragon, that had
been shut up in Middelburg by the army of the
Netherlands. A salute was fired in his honor, but its
sparks reached the magazine of a large ship, which
blew up and destroyed every soul on board.
When Mr. C. P. Huntington arrives in San Fran
cisco, if he is given to figurative parallelism, he will
be able to turn this historical incident to profitable
account. The war of the railroad upon the people ot
California is as wanton and as arbitrary, and its
methods as uncivilized, as the protracted attempt of
Philip of Spain to destroy the liberty of the Nether
lands. It is true that Philip only occasionally left his
capital to survey the fields that Alva desolated, and
it is also true that Mr. Huntington only occasionally
leaves New York, which is the scat of his govern
ment, to observe the â  n that the railroad
forces have wrought in their Western campaign.
When Daniel M. Burns and his compact and discip
lined army attacked the Legislature at Sacramento.
instead <>: a speedy conquest they found themselves
beleaguered by the Republicans, and for nine weeks
or thereabouts they were held in an iron grip. When
surrender was close at hand the Grand Democratic
Commander of the railroad Republicans attempted to
reinforcements and a very noisy salute was dis
charged in his honor, but the magazine caught fire
and the railroad vessel blew up and destroyed every
politician on board.
There are various ways of extracting a moral from
litions or facts that are mure or less analogous.
Mr. Huntington, through his natural intelligence
and his prolonged experience, is an adept in drawing
inferences. We suggest that he apply his powerful
mind to the late Senatorial deadlock and to its dis
astrous consequences. Somewhere or other within
the range of his authority there is a serious respon
sibility to be fixed. The Republicans were victorious,
but assuredly there were trailers within their ranks.
Another campaign is in sight, which will be unusually
important. The railroad volunteers, repudiated by
the regular army, need reorganization, and as a pre
liminary the causes of the late defeat should be
thoroughly investigated. While Mr. Huntington is
here and his associates are clustered around him
there is an excellent opportunity for a court of in
quiry, to be followed by a court-martial and a sen
tence.
WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY.
SIGNOR GUGLIKMO MARCONI, a young
Italian, now in his twenty-sixth year, has ap
parently succeeded in the task of making wire
less telegraphy of practical value. His system has
been subjected to severe tests, and, according to re
. has proven itself equal to the difficulty of
overcoming stormy weather, surmounting hills,
buildings or the curvature of the earth, and of trans
mitting messages to a distance of thirty-two miles.
When the Marconi experiments made for weeks
during the stormy weather of last winter off the coast
of England showed that messages could be sent
without wires for a distance <>; twelve miles through
the air, no matter how windy or foggy or rainy it
might be, it was generally recognized that we were
about to enter upon a new epoch in the history of
telegraphy. Since the results now obtained by the
experiment Qt* sending messages across the British
Channel from South Foreland to Boulogne there can
no longer exist any doubts of the great utility of the
invention. The new epoch has begun.
One of the notable features of the Marconi system
is the simplicity of its construction and the slight
amount of material required to put it into operation.
The messages are transmitted from what is called a
vertical conductor, that is to say, a wire whi^h is run
up to the top of a pole or a lighthouse or any other
object standing high above the landscape. To trans
mit a message eighteen miles a conductor eighty feet
high was found to be sufficient, and it is claimed by
the inventor that with a conductor placed at a point
114 feet high a message could be transmitted to a dis
tance of forty miles.
The simplicity of the apparatus and the slightness |
of its materials are likely to produce important re
sults. There are comparatively few parts of the world
where there is not some hill or tall tree rising fifty
or sixty feet above the general landscape, and there
fore the telegraph operator of the future will have
only to provide himself with that amount of wire and
a small battery to be able to send messages at will |
for a considerable distance. He has only to climb j
the tree or put up a good-sized pole on the top of the
hill, string his light wire and put his battery into
operation, and the thing is done.
This will give spies a powerful aid in their work in
future wars. Messages can be transmitted over the
head of armies by telegraphers miles away in the
rear. British or French spies could send dispatches
across the channel at any hour of the night and the
chances of detection would be slight. It is possible,
in fact, that the invention will start a new epoch in
more things than telegraphy.
PROSPERITY AND THE CONSTITUTION
THE weekly reviews of trade published by Brad
street and by R. G. Dun & Co. are safe guides
to a correct appreciation of business conditions
in the United States. Last year, as has been fully
proved, was the most prosperous in our history. In
truth, it was phenomenal. But this year, judging from
the facts and the figures in the two reviews above
mentioned, it is likely that all records will be sur
passed. In February alone manufactured exports ex
ceeded those of the corresponding month in 1898 by
more than five millions, while exports exceeded im
ports of merchandise by more than twenty-three mil
lions. Iron and steel to meet the demand cannot be
manufactured with present facilities, and wheat,
lumber and wool command ready sale and good
prices.
These are mere hints of a wide range of facts that
can be analytically studied in statistical columns, but
which constitute .in eloquent exposition of natural
advancement under republican government. As a
further indication that is unmistakable, manufacturing
establishments in New Hampshire, in Maine, in Ohio,
in Wisconsin, in Rhode Island, in Massachusetts, in
Illinois, in Connecticut and in other States, have vol
untarily raised wages from sto 10 per cent. It is
apparent, therefore, that the United States has
reached the point of commercial and financial su-
piemacy, and that, unless wantonly thrown away, its
record-breaking history will be indefinitely con
tinued.
The only drawbacks to our prosperity are the
enormous expenditures caused by our late war with
Spain, which, if closed now. it has been conserva
tively estimated, would have cost a billion dollars, and
the unrest and the desire for change that it has -gener
ated. The accumulation of wealth and the increase
of intelligent and enterprising citizens on this conti
nent are due to the constitution that the Examiner
THE SA!* FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 30, 1899.
and other organs and supporters of expansion have
'"outgrown." While nations governed upon the im
perial model, not excepting Great Britain, are driven
to their wits' end to find new fields for their Surplus
population and to extract profits from subjugated
colonies to provide for their domestic necessities, the.
internal expansion of the United States has hardly
commenced. With the opportunities before us, if we
allowed ourselves to drift into the imperialistic cur
rent, to turn our backs upon our own history, to re
verse our own precedents and practice, and to enter
upon a career of conquest such as we are now un
fortunately if necessarily illustrating in the Philip
pines, we might as well shave the locks of Columbia
and allow her to lie as prostrate and as enfeebled before
the imperialistic combination of Europe as Samson
at the feet of Delilah.
The merchants and other business men and indus
trious citizens who have allowed themselves to be at
tracted by the glamour of expansion, if they will ap
ply themselves to the examination of our late com
mercial and financial progress, will become recon
ciled to the abandonment of revolutionary schemes.
The more fully they comprehend the actual past and
the actual present of their own country the deeper
will be their appreciation of the prophetic wisdom of
the founders of the Government and the more fixed
their determination to uphold our constitutional sys
tem. The time is not far distant when the voice of
the people will be heard and understood by party
leaders throughout the Union and when the Asiatic
policy of the expansionists will be stifled by the
Americanism that prefers freedom, independence and
natural development at home to imperial ascendency
in distant quarters of the globe.
THE rather eccentric Mr. Walker of Massachu
setts, who was lor many years chairman of the
House Committee on Currency and Banking, is
no longer a member of Congress. He was seldom in
harmony with his committee, and this lack of agree
ment caused the omission of committee meetings for
a long time. He was the author of a peculiarly com
plicated bill for a banking system, and was not toler
ant of any other proposition. At the same time he
had but little faith in his own measure and appeared
rather as an obstructionist than a promoter of legis
lation to simplify our tangled and complex financial
statutes. His final expression of opinion at the re
cent adjournment of Congress was highly character
istic. Admitting the bad conditions of our financial
system and its capability at any time to do mischief
and injure the public credit, yet he declared that its
reform would be the death of any party attempting it.
Notwithstanding this morbid view of the situation,
the effort for correction is now in more promising
shape than it has been since Mr. Carlisle called atten
tion to the sinister operation of "the emiless chain."
A committee of the Republican joint caucus of Con
is charged with the work of framing legislation
to definitely affirm the gold standard as the perma
nent policy of the Government, and to take the
treasury out of the banking business, and to provide
a soundly safeguarded banking system which will
flexibly adapt itself to the currency and credit re
quirements of all parts of the country.
It is not now known whether all these steps will be
taken at once, but all will naturally and necessarily
follow the first. The sound money sentiment of the
country is as vital as it was in 1896, and does not pro
pose to surrender a foot of the ground which it has
gained. The Sound Money League is still active, and
the Indianapolis Monetary Conference, represented
by its executive committee, is in touch with the joint
caucus committee. That executive committee meets
in New York on April 7 to put in shape the purposes
of the conference.
The Secretary of the Treasury is in active sympathy
and co-operation with the movement, and is not
lulled to inattention by the apparent decline of the
free silver issue. It is perfectly well understood by
politicians that whatever collateral issues are be
friended by Mr. Bryan are intended to be used only
to catch votes to get into power in order that his pe
culiar financial ideas may be forced upon the country.
In view of this obvious plan of his campaign it is ab
solutely necessary that every statutory peg upon
which he hangs that issue be pulled out now. The
statutory power to reissue greenbacks, or to enlarge
the volume of the original issue now out, should be
taken away. When the war revenue bill of last year
was before Congress it was demonstrated that the
Bryan party intends to pass beyond free silver at 16
to I and to enrich its financial programme by in
dorsing an issue of paper currency, with its redemp
tion feature limited or entirely absent, and its volume
regulated by that indefinite boundary, "the needs of
the country." It is this intention that moves the
Secretary of the Treasury to say that "it will be wise
for the sound money forces to hold themselves in line
to oppose any fresh attack of the kind that was so
successfully resisted in iÃy6." It is expected that the
executive committee meeting in New York City on
the 7th of April will furnish a programme which will
attract the attention and crystallize the sentiment of
the country.
Illinois has imitated California to the extent that
some weak-minded legislator has introduced a fool
bill similar to that which made Morehouse, Gage and
ethers appear ridiculous. Probably imitation will
end at this point. Writers for the newspapers will
sign their product when they choose to do so, and
not all the chumps ever elected to office can change
the programme.
We arc now told on "reliable authority," doubtless
emanating from a ''distinguished statesman who pre
fers that his name be not mentioned," that during
February the United States offered the Philippines to
England. Excellent evidence that the report is base
less exists in the fact that the Philippines are not in
possession of England.
Possibly Dewey Avon his way into the good graces
of the Filipinos through having had to open his en
gagement in the islands by killing a lot of Spaniards.
Otis did not get this chance, and when at times he has
had to demean himself v/ith unfriendly violence there
have been no Spaniards to suffer.
Kansas people have just lynched a murderer. Of
course this was wrong, but as Kansas goes regularly
through the farce of sentencing murderers to death
and then permits them to die of old age, the exist
ence of mitigating circumstances must be admitted.
The parricide who lyis just been sentenced to death
in Kansas need not make a fuss about it. In that
State a sentence of this kind is as dignified and sol
emn a bluff as ex-Senator Peffer.
The manner in which recruiting for service in the
Philippines progresses makes the fact evident that
Uncle Sam will have as many soldiers as he needs.
They won't be fed on carrion, either.
If Aguinaldo will surrender only with the capture
of his capital, he will have to be made prisoner. He
can carry his style of capital under his hat.
FINANCIAL LEGISLATION
CALIFORNIANS
AGAIN READY
TO VOLUNTEER
'Will Gladly Answer a
Call for Troops.
THE QUOTA WILL BE SMALL
THIS STATES SHARE MAY BE
LESS THAN ONE BEGIMENT.
Beports From All Over the Country
Show That More Men. Will Ans
wer Than the President
Will Call For.
The rumors that the President is about
to call for 35,000 volunteers have caused a
deal of speculation In army circles,
the ranks of the National Guard, in the
office, the workshop and the home.
California has freely griven four volun
teer regiments to th< t the coun
try. Her thousands of young men have
stepped from the ranks of civil life to
don the blue and follow the (lag. They
have marched away to a foreign shore
many of them never to return. Now comes
another call, and With it the question,
"Will our young men respond freeiy to
the call as before?"
This question was put to General Dick
lnson yesterday afternoon. He smiled a
moment and replied: "That was an un
jsary question. The true question will
be 'i<>t 'Wilt our men go?' but 'How many
Will the Government accept? 1 When the
first call came for volunteers, about one
year ago, the boys of the National Guard
rushed into tne army. Three regiments of
them met with disappointment. Iney
were disbanded without having had a
chance to show the stuff everybody knows
they are made of. The bill reorganizing
the Xational Guard has recently been
passed, and they are QOW going back into
their old companies. I know the boys
well enough, however, to state positively
that should the Government ask for a
thousand men from California three thou
sand will off. r their services. Why. those
boys who did not gel an opportunity to
go" out to the fields of battle will never
let over their disappointment. Uncle Sam
has but to hint that he wants men, and
Nun will see our boys leaving the farm
and workshop to pick up the rifle. Cali
fornia can easily furnish more men than
she did before, and the Xational Guards
men are ready, as they have ever been."
At the headquarters of the adjutant gen
eral of the Department of California the
matter was also Informally discussed, al
though no definite information ran come
from this source untii advices are re
ceived from Washington. It was the gen
eral Impression there that in case the call
is made it will be mad- on the same basis
as former ones, and California's pro rata
will be less than a thousand men. It is
not expected that the Natlphal Guard or
the Naval Reserves will be called upon
as a body. In fact, the Naval Reserves
will in all probability- be out of the ques
tion altogether. As for raising the requi
site number of men in the country, no dif
flculty whatever is anticipated. If any
State '8 unable to furnish its pi"
the ranks will lie filled with volunteers
from other States. Private and official
correspondence from all parts of the
country shows that there is a decided sur
plus of material from which soldiers may
be made. The disappointment of Califor
nia's Sixth. Seventh and Eighth regi
ments is still fresh in the min/ls of army
people, and It is also known that in Neft
York City 1300 men who wished to enlist
have been turned away. Taking It alto,
gether, it is plain that the Government
can get -ill the men it needs without re
sorting to the draft system or offering
bounties.
NATIVE SONS PLEASE
UNIVERSITY MEN
HEARTY INDORSEMENT OF THE
ENDOWMENT IDEA.
Faculty and Student Body Give Cor
dial Response to the Project
for a New Chair.
BERKELEY, March project of
the Native Sons to endow a chair of Cali
j fornia history at th" State University is
< meeting with a cordial response from the !
university faculty and student body.
As announced in The ('all recently
several of the prominent Native Sons in j
j the State have started a movement to i
| contribute $100,0u0 toward the establish- j
ment of a new professor's chair at Berke
ley. They Intend, to take the matter be- I
fore the next meeting of the Grand Par
lor, and if possible to make the endow
ment an official action on the part of the
order. The department which the leaders
of the movement have in view would be
! known as that of California history, and
it would aim to carry an exhaustive re
search into the historical records of the
State from the Very earliest times, to
collect all the available data on the sub
ject and. as Car aa possible, to undertake
1 a regular course of instruction for stu
dents interested in that special line of ;
work.
When the news of this project became i
generally known at the university
it aroused considerable interest. Both
the faculty and the students manifested j
1 a disposition to welcome it heartily.
Comments of the most favorable kind
were made on all sides. Although bene
factors have appeared from time to time,
and with their ample wealth have found
ed permanent professorships in various ;
j subjects, such, for instance, aa the .Mills
chair of moral philosophy, endowed by D. j
i O. Mills, and the Agassiz professorship
! of Oriental languages and literatures, es
tablished by the late Senator Tompkins,
the fact that the new department pur
posed springs from the Native Sons as a
body all over the State constitutes it
something quite unique, and the Interest
It evokes differs from the passing atten
tion which other gifts have met with.
President Martin Kellogg looks for
ward tn a favorable action on the part of
the Grand Parlor. He said this evening:
"I sincerely h<>pe that the movement may
prove successful. We should be only too i
delighted t<> have such a chair in the unl- ;
1 consider it a most admirable
.
Bernard I*. Moses, head of
partmeni of history and political
rds the plan with great en
-iii "Nothing could be finer." he
Iced. '"Some of the originators of
heine have been in communication
with me, and I have assured them that
the Idea i* not only practicable, but may
prove of immense importance in investi
i gating a field of history as yet so little
I explored. The study of the question
i should go back to the very earliest period
' of Spanish settlement. It might even go
beyond that. With the libraries of Ban
Francisco and the old landmarks of early
settlers we have first-hand information
of inestimable value. The subject would
doubtless be placed under one general de
partment of history and a special in
structor engaged who is qualified for the
work."
Thomas' R. Bacon, associate professor
of European history, said: "The projeci
| is of more than ordinary importai
' the subject of history. Not only is the
'â  field of almost unlimited extent, but many
j of the documents relating to Spanish set
| tlement and American exploration ar
! being preserved, and these should be se- i
I cured and examined at once. Bancroft i
j did pioneer work in this direction, but
there is still much to be accomplished.
: We need a competent investigator to give
' his time to this special question. The en
: dowment of $100,000 is quite sufficient to
; provide for the chair."
Among the student body the same im- ;
: presslon prevailed, and the outcome of
! the movement will be watched anxiously.

MARGARET SHIELDS' STORY
TELLS HOW SHE ASSISTED TO
FIBE A DWELLING.
Carried Out All Furniture, Even to

Folding Doors and Ap
plied the Match.
â  Tf Henry Beacom succeeds in cloarine;
j himself of the charge of arson a{
him he will have to put up a sti
that will break a few cogs from
wheels' of justice. Yesterday morning hi a
case went to trial, and before the night
fell he was apparently bopeli MI3
j tagled in the meshes of evidence. Mrs
Margaret Shields, accused jointly
Beacom on a charge bf having fln
residence of John T. and Julia Shields at
201 Virginia avenue on the night of Sep
! tember 25, 1898, and who subs, q
'. pleaded guilty, was the strongest wit
ness against Beacom, but there were
others.
Mrs. Shields took the stand and imme
-1 diately launched into the story of the
burning of the Shields residence
said that although she pleaded guilty to
the, charge against her she did n I
fire to the house, she simply offered Bea
con all the furniture and $KÂ»0 in coin If he
: would apply the torch. She wanted to
burn the house to get the mount of an
insurance policy she held upon it. When
. the plan was finally perfected the wit
i ness and Beacom carried all the furni-
I ture out. but when it Came to the mantel
piece it was too heavy and Mrs. Beacom
assisted. Then they took out the folding
doors, ripped up the rioor, poured the
contents of three large coal oil cans
around the house and B. acorn applied the
match. "But he made a bad job of it,"
said Mrs. Shields, referring to the efforts
of Beacom to burn the house, "and the
fire boys came and put out the fire before
it was fairly started."
Mrs. Shields rounded out her story re
garding the setting fire to the building,
and concluded it by saying that she had
been playing the races and was a little
short and needed money.
When asked by Beacom's counsel
whether she expected to bo leni
dealt with for testifying againsi Beacom,
she said, "The police simply told me to
tell the truth, and sure I ex
off altogether." It is needless to say that
she will doubtless be disappointed.
When Mrs. Shields left the stand with
the impression that she had vindicated
herself and through her testimony had
red her release. Lillian D. Mullen,
Who resided with Mrs. Shields, took the
stand and corroborated all the statements
made by the first witness. In addition
she said that when Beacom had all ar
rangements made to Bet tire to the dwell
ing and was adjusting his sal
prior to igniting them she came along,
and Beacom banded her a lighted match
and ordered her to set fire to the build
ing She refused and ran away, ana
Beacom did the "job" himself.
The case goes on to-day.

LOEHR'S CLOCK
PROVED TO BE
A FALSIFIER
Its Owner's Damning
Evidence.
BEARING ON THE ADAMS CASE
THE PRELIMINARY EXAMINA
TION RESUMED.
Efforts to Reconcile Officer Herlihy's
Statements With Those of Grip
man Cox â Sergeant Duke
Testifies.
Much of the time at the hearing of
-Mrs. Minnie Adams, charged with pofs
onlng her two-year-old son, was con
sterday afternoon In exposing
th.- vagaries of Druggist George W.
Loehr'a cuckoo clock. Mr. Loebr him
self testified to its utter unreliability
and general unworth. According to the
nee it is about as thoroughly dis
reputable a ticker as ever hung on a
wall, and no credence whatever can be
placed on it. Just imagine a clock that
without any provocation will brazenly lie
to the public by simply showing its "face
and whirling its dupes on toward the
grave before their allotted time, or else.
misleading its victims Into loitering on
the way until suddenly they awake to a
realization that the world has left them
behind, and while everybody else is go
ing to church or the ball game on Sun
day they are dragging along with the
affairs of day before yesterday! If that
(1-uk were placed on trial for perjury it
would just naturally lie out of conviction
by showing the Judge that it hadn't
been arrested yet.
Think of the havoc it might play with
Druggist Loehr's customers if they un
dertook to take their medicines by it.
P\>r instance, a man who had to take a
powder after breakfast would just as
likely an not have to wake himself up
I when his own timepiece said it was mid
night and trape.s around the bedroom
and fall over the hassock and wake u^
the baby just because of the propensity
ol that clock (or handling time no reck
lessly. Why, if a man started down to
thi corner for half an hour he might not
get home, again until breakfast time, and
he never would be able to convince his
Wife that it was all due to Loehr's clock.
It's a cuckoo, sure enough, and it's a
menace to the peace of the entire {Vest
em Addition.
No wonder the defense fought to ex
aiiy evidence in which that clock
I figured to account for the discrepancy in
S the time the defendant is alleged to have
left the drugstore and when she boarded
a westbound Geary street car ai tho
corner.
Aside from the thorough exposure of
the clock's unworth, little of importance
noi already made putlic was developed.
Policeman Herlihy was the lirst wit
ness. It was Officer Herlihy who stood
on the corner of Geary and Devlsadero
streets, at Loehr's drugstore, on the
evening of Sunday, March 12, and saw a
woman he identifies as the defendant
come out, and, removing the wrapper
from the bottle, tear off the label, which
Bhe threw away, after which she boarded
a westbound Geary-street car. As near
as he could fix the time thla was about
five minutes before 9.
Gripman Cox, who has already testified
that the woman rode on his car. fixed the
time at two minutes after 9. Herlihy
was subjected to a long and tedious
cross-examination at the hands of Bar
rister Guilfoyle. but held to his original
story in the main. He picked up the frag
ments of the label and took them into the
drugstore. It Was a red label, containing
the words, "Carbolic acid."
A bottle on which wan pasted a simi
lar label was shown him for comparison,
which the defense vigorously objected
to, as neither bottle nor label was the
original.
Sergeant Duke stated to a Call reporter
that it was impossible to find the bot
tle in which the acid was originally sold.
He said he made a partial search for it
on the day of the poisoning, and the fol
lowing day he went out to the Tyrrell
home to continue tho search, but found
Eddy Tyrrell, defendant's brother, had
carefully raked over the whole yard. It
was admitted, he said, that It was the
first time the yard had been cleaned up.
Druggist Loehr next gave his clock
a reputation for falsehood and unreliabil
ity such as no honest clock would sub
mit to without resenting.
Then Sergeant Duke was called to the
witness-stand and had not concluded his
direct testimony when court adjourned
until 2 o'clock this afternoon. His testi
mony, as far as given, was identical with
that he gave at the Coroner's inquest.
The defense will undoubtedly subject him
to B rigid cross-examination in the hope
of tripping him up on some points of
vital importance.
CRUELTY NOT PROVED.
Quick Verdict of the Jury in the Case
of "White Hat" McCarty.
It took the jury In the case of "White
Hat" McCarty, charged with cruelty to
his horses, in Judge Graham's court yes
terday afternon less than a minute to re
turn a verdict of not guilty. Prosecuting
Attorney Wentworth conducted the prose
cution and Colonel Kowalsky represented
the defendant.
The witnesses for the prosecution testi
fied that the horse* had been without hay
and had gnawed the fences in their hun
ger. Some of the fourteen were in good
condition and some were not. Witnesses I
for the defense, Including J. C. Nealon,
ex-Assessor, and Drs. Williamson and
Egan. testified that the horses wen- a.s
well fed as their requirements called for,
and employes of the defendant and the
defendant himself testified that hay was
sent out to the lot daily more than suf
ficient for their needs. It was also testi-
Qed that horses will always gnaw red
wood fences when they can get the
chance. The defendant's instructions to
his men were to treat tho horses under
their care kindly and feed them well.
GOAT ISLAND PUNCTURED.
A Hundred-Foot Well Produces a
Good Water Supply.
Nature has deprived either the Contra
Costa or Oakland Water Company of an
anticipated profitable contract with the
Government. Water in abundance has
been found on Goat Island, and in conse
quence the Navy Department need not,
as was first thought necessary, arrange
for piping sufficient for the needs of the
new training school from Oakland.
Some time ago, when it was thought
necessary to pipe water from Oakland,
Captains Dickens and Glass, who have
charge of the naval training school, con
cluded that before any contract was let
il might be wise to prospect for water,
James W. Low of this city was given a
contract to bore for water, and at the
depth of lot) feet water was struck. Then
the Government contracted with Low to
bore a 24-inch well and to supply an en
gine and boiler to drain it. It is esti
mated that this well will furnish 50,000
gallons of water a day, an amount suf
ficient for the needs of VW) persons, a
number greatly in excess of that which
will constitute the personnel of the new
school.
As soon as the water supply was fount!
a "good luck" telegram was sent to Sena,
tor Perkins, but while he is congratulat
ing himself over the discovery, the OaK.
land Water companies are not over
jubilant, for the water is not theirs to
sell.
UNDERWRITERS WHO
SOUGHT SOLITUDE
SECRET SESSION OF INSURANCE
MEN AT CLIFF HOUSE.
Talked on Rates and Commissions,
but Came to No Definite Con
clusion on Either.
The Pacific Coast Board of Underwrit
ers sought solitude out at the Cliff House
yesterday, where the members might con
fer within sound of the sea, yet out of the
reach of messages from their respective
various offices.
The session was a continuation of the
one held recently In Monterey. As the
business was not completed down there
the board hunted around for some other
secluded spot, and found it at the ocean.
The day was spent in talk â talk of rates
and commissions, and the discussion never
advanced so fax as a decision on any
thing important.
The rates on San Francisco property
caused most of the argument. They were
in process of "equalization" ' during the
greater part of yesterday's session, and
another day will be spent on them before
they are finally brought down or up to
satisfactory bhape. It was explained by
Charles D. Haven, president uf the board,
that many things have conspired to
change insurance conditionsâ better fire
fighting facilities, more and larger water
mains and hydrants. Improved apparatus
and a better class of buildings. So the I
rates are unjustly high in some places,
and, he was willing to add, unjustly low
in others. That is the reason they are '
being equalized.
Another subject was commissions to be
paid "premium getters." or insurance so
licitors, but nothing definite was done in
that direction either, says the president.
The session was held under cover of the
profoundest secrecy. No one would say a
word about .what had been done except
the president, and he was authorized to i
give out only the barest outline. They did i
not see what interest the public, the pre
mium-paying public, had in their affairs,
and they declined to say whether they
attacked local rates with a pruning- knife
or a spring rain. They will secrete them
selves downtown to-day and will do some
more talking.

FINAL ARGUMENT
IN RACE TRACK
INJUNCTION SUIT
Murasky Takes Case
Under Advisement.
NIGHT SESSION OF COURT
PROMISES TO RENDER A DECIS
ION SATURDAY.
Will Rule Whether the Police Can Be
Debarred From Entering the
Grounds at Ingleside
Without Warrants.
The question whether Chief Lees and
the officers under his command shall be
debarred from entering the grounds of
the Pacific Coast Jockey Club at Ingle
side to enforce the anti-poolsolling ordin
ance passed by the Boar.l of Supervisors
on March 13 now rests largely upon the
decision of Superior Judge Murasky in
the injunction proceedings Instituted by
the racing association. The case was sub
mitted to the court at 10:30 last night,
after arguments extending over three
days, and a decision will be rendered Sat
irday, covering all the points at issue.
.The court has three motions under ad
visementâlirst, the motion of the Jockey
Club to net aside the modification of Judgo
Dsingerneld'a injunction and to restore
the original injunction; second, the mo
tion of the respondents for the dissolu
tion of the original injunction, and the
motion of the respondents to set the caso
for trial. The granting of the first wouid
act to res-train the police from entering
the racetrack grounds for the purpose of
securing evidence of violation of the or
dinance or making arrests of bookmakers
and their employes except on warrants.
The second would leave matters as at
present so far as the interference with
the authority of the police is concerned
temporarily, and the third would bring
the entire matter into court for a final de
cision on the merits of the entire con
troversy in the Superior Court, subject to
appeal to the Supreme Court.
'I he arguments have been exhaustive
on both sides, the case of the respon
dents being ably presented by Attorney
Garret McUJnemey and District Attorney
Murphy, while the rating association
was represented by Attorney Ach. The
latter mad.- tin- opening argument and
Mr. McÃnerney followed, concluding his
argument Tuesday afternoon.
Argument on behalf of the respondents
was resumed yesterday at H::iv a. m. by
District Attorney Murphy, who con
sumed an hour in citing' additional au
thorities and presenting further reasons
why the court should refuse the petition
of the racing association to set aside the
modification of the injunction. Judge
Murphy's argument was along the same
lines as that of Garret McEnerney, who
preceded him and whose conclusions in
the premises he unqualifiedly indopsed.
being a contention of the absolute legal
right of tin police to enter the grounds
of the plaintiff, with or without their
consent, for the purpose of preventing
the commission of crime, whenever they
had good reason to believe that a viola
tion of the law was being committed
or its violation was contemplated
therein and taking the ground that the
authority of a court of equity could not
successfully be invoke. 1 to protect law
breakers from the consequences of th< ir
misdeeds or restrain the police from for
cible Interference to prevent the commis
sion thereof.
â¢The District Attorney said the police
disavowed any intention or desire to. in
terfere with the corporation in the exer
else of Its proper functions and privileges.
Chief Lees and his subordinates had not
attempted to interfere with the racing of
horses at the track, but only to prevent
the selling of pools on the races and to
arrest those engaged in so doing. In this
they had acted within their authotity. as
poolselling had been declared a misde
meanor by the Board of Supervisors of
the city and county of San Francisco in
the legal exercise of it* legislative power.
He placed the Pacific Coast Jockey club
on the wimc plane with the bookmakers,
inasmuch as it had sold the latter the
privilege of doing business at thy race
track, and had by so doing placed Itself J
in the position of an accomplice in the !
violation of the law. He declared that
the principle that a man's house is his
castle had no application in the case of
the racing association's grounds, as the
latter was a place of public resort, and j
as such was subject to the supervision '
of the police power of the city and county
that order might be prserved and the
welfare of the community be conserved.
"1 hold that the police have the legal
right to enter any theater or hall or other
place where public gatherings are held
lor the purpose <>f guarding against the
infraction of tho laws of the community,"
said Mr. Murphy. "This racetrack is a
public place and subject to the police
regulations of the city. The public is in
vited to gather there to witness contests !
of speed between horses, and any person
is freely admitted to the grounds without
question on the payment of an admission
fee. It would be a strange condition of
affairs if tho officers of the law alone were
to be debarred from entering the grounds
because the proprietors of the racetrack
objected to their possible interference
with the unlawful practice of gambling, !
as conducted by the bookmakers with
their sanction and indorsement. I ask the i
court if the police are to be prohibited
from entering public resorts where all :
other citizens are freely admitted, not- ;
withstanding they have reliable informa- ;
tlon that a crime is being or is about to
be committed therein?
"I ask further. Will this court hold that
an arrest cannot be made until after a
crime has been committed and have the
police officers of this city no authority
to arrest a man when they have reliable
information that he is about to commit
a crime, without a warrant?
"Suppose the dead walls of this city
were placarded with the announcement
that an indecent performance was to bo
given In a certain hall or theater and
the Chief of Police should send a force
of officers to the place for the purpose of
preventing a violation of th<- laws and the
proprietor of the hall or theater should
object to their entranceâ would the court
hold that they had no right under the ',
law to enter regardless of his objections? j
"I understand there has been filed here-!
by the plaintiffs an affidavit that there
has been no pools told at the racetrack
since the anti-Rambling ordinance was
passed. We have the affidavits of Chief .
of Police Lees, Captain Witman and Cap- !
tain Glllen. which have been filed in this i
case, to the effect that the selling of
pools has been carried on at the track
in their presence, openly and flagrantly,
on at Last two occasions since the pass
age of that ordinance. The Police De
partment is in duty bound to enforce the
observance of the laws of the city and
PtatÂ« and its usefulness would be Berious- i
ly Impaired If the Chief of Police and'
lus subordinates should be restrained i
from the exercise of their official func- '<
tions, as is contemplated by the original '
injunction in this case."
At the conclusion of the District Attor
ney's argument proceedings were con
tinued until 7:30 p. m.
When court reconvened in the evening
Attorney Ach began his closing argu
ment without loss of time. He took ex
ceptions to the statements of opposing
counsel that the parties applying to a
court of equity for relief must come In
to court "with clean hands."
"Our hands are clean," he declared
â¢ -Tii. Pacific Coast Jockey Club has com
mitted no crime and has violated no ord
inance or law of the city or State. It
has a charter and a franchise from the
State of California to conduct racing
contests in the city and county of San
Days of the Horse Numbered.
The greatest electrician in the world declares
that the days of the horse are numbered, and
that in a short time electricity will completely
supplant man's most useful animal. In 20
years, he asserts, the horse will be a curiosity.
Diseases of the stomach, liver, kidneys and
blood would also be a curiosity If all sufferers
would take Hostetter's Stomach Bitters. There
â would then be practically no dyspepsia, ner
vousness, sleeplessness, indigestion, constipa
tion. maJarial fever and ague.
Francisco for a period of fifty years from
is%. It is the owner of a valuable tract
of real estate which is ail paid for, and
has expended in improvements thereon
$250,000. The value of this property has
been greatly depreciated by the action
of the police in invading the grounds of
the association, without due process of,
law, and arresting its patrons lor the
alleged violation of a city ordinance.
Moreover, if these unwarranted raids are
permitted to continue the improvements
l have referred to, amounting to a quar
ter of a million of dollars, will be ren
dered utterly valueless and the associa
tion will have no redress at law for the
reason that the Chief of Police and me
officers who accompany him are not
financially able to maKe adequate rep
aration should a suit for damages be de
cided against them."
Mr Ach cited decisions from innumera
ble authorities in support of his conten
tion that the police had- no legal right
to enter the grounds of the plaintiffs
without a warrant, but finally, in re
sponse to questions by Mr. McEnerney.
he admitted that the injunction desired
by the racing association was ' not one
to prevent the police from entering tne
grounds, but to restrain them from ar
resting the patrons of the race track, be
cause such action tended to drive away
the patrons of the track and injure the
business of the corporation."
In concluding his argument, Mr. Ach
declared that the crusade against pool
selling was inspired by certain newspa
pers which had only recently published
articles denouncing the Chief of Police,
but which, since he had raided the race
track, had lauded his action. He alat.
cautioned the court to beware of news
paper articles written in connection with
the injunction proceedings, as they were
written with the knowledge that they
would "come under his eye." The case
was then submitted.

The New Cure for Kidney, Bladder
and Uric Acid Troubles.
Almost everybody .who reads the
.newspapers is sure to know of Swamp-
Root.
It is the great medical triumph of the
nineteenth century; discovered after
years of scientific research by the emi-
nent kidney and bladder specialist, Dr.
Kilmer, and has truly wonderful pow-
ers in curing kidney, liver, bladder and
uric acid diseases.
Kidney trouble is responsible for more
sickness and sudden deaths than any
other disease, and is so deceptive that
thousands have it without knowing it.
Thousands owe their health and v*-' Q
life to Swamp-Root and thousand,
more who to-day think themselves be-
yond help, can be made well by the usa
of this great remedy.
Swamp-Root has been tested in s*r
many ways, in hospital work, in private
practice, among the helpless, too poor
to purchase relief, and has proved so
successful in every case that a special
arrangement has been made by which
all readers of The Call, who have not
already tried it, may have a sample
bottle sent absolutely free by mail.
Also a book telling more about Swamp-
Root and containing some of the thou-
sands upon thousands of testimonial
letters received from men and women
who owe their good health, in fact, their
very lives, to the wonderful curative
properties of Swamp-Root. Be sure
and mention the San Francisco Daily
Call when sending your address to Dr.
Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N. Y.
If you are already convinced that
Swamp-Root is what you need, you can
purchase the regular fifty-cent and one-
dollar size bottles at drugstores.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 23.â The bull movement
a stocks, which started Saturday, received Its
first material check shortly before noon to-day.
The dealings were considerably above the mil- !
lion mark, with nearly a Quarter of a million ;
of the transactions in Brooklyn Transit. The '
(sensational advance in the ' forenoon brought |
about realizing tales on an enormous scale in '
the late session. Foreign exchange was strong i
and higher, especially on short bills. There was i
no "satisfactory supply of commercial bills, and !
the April settlements were given as the reason .
for the increased remitting demand, which was i
said to be unconnected with any anticipation I
of the (settlement of the Philippine indemnity
money. There was a flurry in call money, which |
ent as high as 7 per cent and closed- at 3%. i
These circumstances, together with the early
.strength In wheat, accelerated the afternoon
declines, which embraced even more stocks than I
' were prominent in the rise. Brooklyn Tran- j
sit made an extreme advance of nine points, |
dropped over eight and closed with a net ad- 'â 
vance of five points from the top.. Sales in i
thi.s .stock, which sold to-day over 100 points â 
above figures prevailing last April. '
-â were in Jurge blocks of stocks thrown
ever by traders on the â ! sclirie. Sup
jxirtins purchases by the parties identified â 
with the property resulted In a rally. As in
the manipulation of this stock many brokers
are used, it is difficult to say whether the de- â 
cline was on genuine realizing or to shake oS i
an undescribable . following. Although North- .
west closed with a gain of less than two points, j
It had at one time risen the -extreme of seven. I
New York Central, which at one time was up >
Cs. retained less than three of the rise. These !
el >cks were unusually, active and revived talk ;
of the possibility of a consolidation. It was '>
eaid that there had been enormous realizing by j
Interests active In manipulating the rise in j
several stocks, which were usually taken be- i
cause of the purchasing demand aroused by i
their recent strength. This, however. la a
matter of pure conjecture. Reports of a hitch
in the delivery of certain properties to the i
Continental Tobacco Company and talk of the j
stocks weak most of the day, American To- j
possibility of a trade ti^ht kept the tobacco i
t>acco being off over three points and Conti
nental 2%. Federal Steel and similar properties
fiufftred on realizations. Weakness also . de
,' veloped in General Electric, Rubber, Atchlsoat
prefern ci and the coalers. The granger stocks
showed good sains In the early period of
. strength and receded with the rest of the mar
ket in the early afternoon. The. market closed
weak and active, with many sharp losses.
â¢ Railroad bonds participated fully in the va
garies of stocks to-day, but the ranÂ£e was
well within the point of the taunt active Issues.
Total sales, $4,345,000.

The markets hero wore extremely Idle to-day
before the holidays. The tone was hard. i
Americans were steady until the afternoon,
when New York advanced New York Central

the general market. The close was at the !
best and there was a further rise on the street, :
though finally prices were rather below the I
best.

CROP PROSPECTS FOR MARCH.
NEW YORK. March 29.â The Commercial Ail- i
vertiser to-day prints Thornan's April crop re
port. It estimates the present condition of
winter wheat at 84.2 per cent, representing a
decline of 6 per cent during the past month,
and as compared with December 1 13.3 per |
cent. On the corresponding date last year, the
i condition was returned at 89. S per cent. Re
turns from the six principal States east of the
Rocky Mountains (Ohio. Michigan, Indiana, :
Illinois, Missouri and Kansas) are practically
discouraging, showing an average condition of i
but 83.5 per cent, as contrasted with 91.1 per
cent last month and 86.6 per cent last April. |
The average condition for the States of Cull- â

I Instead of being, as expected, weak. The j
I strength abroad was not nearly so powerful
; a i actor, however, as the home news about
j damage to winter wheat. Damage reports were
I general, coming from all quarters where win
j ter wheat is grown. The conviction forced
itself upon many skeptics that the amount of
Injury done by the unfavorable winter was
i greater than anything of the kind in a num-
I ber of years and much heavier than could be
I compensated for by increased acreage. Every
: countryman who had an acquaintance In the
i commission business appeared to have consid
i ered it a duty to report wholesale destruction
i to crops. The ordinary market Information re
i lating to receipts or shipments did not re
; ceive much attention. May consequently kept
rising from 71% c until the price reached 72% c.
At that point some realizing resulted in a
slight reaction. The market became very
Strong in the last hour of the session and rose
| rapidly from 73% c for May to 73% c, closing at

! apparent 'reluctance during the first half hour

i tendency was not so persistently opposed by
the bears and made more rapid progress. The

' about the only Independent reason for strength
in corn. May advanced %c.

An unusual feature of the cue is thÂ»
.-'-. cool deliberation with which, he ap

â had: evidently been contemplating the j

dressed- to his brother and sister-in-law,
â  -found on his body, was written some days
â¢.. .-agro. The date Was afterward scratched
â â¢ out and March 29 substituted. The letter
:';fs as follows:
SAN' FRANCISCO, March 29, 1599.
: : DearlHarry and Annie Lieb: When this
' â¢â¢r.oie reaches you I will be dead in my office.
â â¢Come for me*. I have been contempt .

Apparently It was his original intention
â¢r-.to kill himself In the office .after business
" â¢â¢".hours, but later he changed his mind,
â  perhaps because ho wanted to see his
â  : brother again. Before leaving his offTcÂ«
he "arranged a number of notes on his
â¢ -desk, explaining where his personal ef
[ ' fects might bo found and what disposl
â  tion he wished to have made of them.
. He left practically three wills, all in favor i
,' of his brother Harry.
The letters, even those written before
; ho left his desk forever, were all in a
.. piayi, firm hand. Across the corner of
â . an' old envelope were the words in pencil,
â ' : .^Ambitionâ of souls."
Mr. Lieb's relatives say that his wife,
'â¢ whom he dearly loved! died about a year
â¢. " aco, nd he never fully recovered from |
the low. He has often spoken of sui- i
j'.'.clde. and they dreaded lest he keep his

CONVICT-MADE STOVES
SENT TO THIS CITY
LOCAL MANUFACTURERS ARE
ALARMED BY DISCOVERY.
The Sale of Prison-Made Goods Will
Prevent a Proposed Raise in
Wages of Iron-Molders.
The officers of the Manufacturers' and
Producers' Association were considera
bly agitated yesterday over ihe informa
tion that a carload of stoves made in
the Oregon penitentiary at Salem had
been shipped into this city to come into
competition with local makers, who em
â¢â  hite labor. The informa
tion was given by a gentleman who knew |
of what he spoke, being- himself In the
hardware business. He called attention
fact that recently m the Eastern
manufacturing c< nters the wages of
niolders and makers of stoves have
used, and added that from his
conversations with local makers the lat
t< r will have to follow suit and make a
raise in the wages of their employes very
soon. In the event of the town and sur
rounding country being flooded by the
products of the convict institutions of
other States it will be impossible to in
workmen's wages,
r Lewis at once started out to lo
cate the convict goods with the view of
getting the members of the association
to throw their influence on the. importers
of the convict goods to dispose of the
stuff elsewhere. If they refused to do
this it Is proposed to : advertise the na
ture of the. articles and the names of the
importers to such an extent that the
will be warned and the trade be
1 elsewhere. Such an agitation
took place a couple of years ago when
Julian Bonntag was the president of the
lation, and the benefit to the com r
rnunity was Inestimable. At â¢ the same
time every effort was made to secure the
ge of laws prohibiting the work of
tate Prison convicts coming in
competition with that of free labor. The
bill' became a law, but in the pr<
the law does not apply to the goods
stion.
The present interstate commerce laws
prevent the stopping of goods from en
tering the. State, but it is expected that
the Southwick House bill, which the na
tional lawmakers are endeavoring to
have become a law, will, remeay this de-
Ac cording to Ihe. suggestion of
Manager Goodwin the best thing to do is
to expos.- the whole affair of the convict
goods Importation' and create a senti
ment so strong against the injustice to
laboring men that the importers will tind
this an unprofitable market. He said:
"We have learned from reliable
sources that a number of local stove
makers propose to increase the wages of
their molders to keep pace with the
manufacturers in the East, and unless
we can Btop the cheap convict-made
Htoves from be.ing sent here from the
B.ilem Penftentiary . the manufacturers
â will be unable, to make the promised
raise From what we can learn there
is nothing on the goods in the shape of
marks or stamps to show where they
were made, and the public which would
not' purchase such stuff has no way of
telling whether the stoves are made by
free men or by the felons of another
We expect to be in full posses
sion of all of the facts before another
twenty-four hours is passed and these
facts will be nvnV public."

BOARD OF HEALTH HAS
A PROBLEM TO SOLVE
" â¢ , â  .â â  â  ">-:>,â¢,. r %*
"*" /OFFICIALS of the Health Department are grappling with an incipient <
9 f I epidemic of cerebro-spinal meningitis. The disease has not resulted in a .
rt I I large number of deaths, but they have increased out of all reasonable <
3? ' proportion recently. In February fifteen deaths wrere attributed to the -
0 disease, as against two in the corresponding month last year and three in <
~2i the year before.
Â° "The disease is not epidemic," said Dr. A. P. O'Brien, the Health Officer, I
"*" yesterday "The number of deaths is unusually large, but should cause no â¢
Â° uneasiness. I* attribute it to the immense number of men of the volunteer ]
1 army quartered here under bad sanitary conditions last summer and also (
9 to the Inn? dry spell. The disease is invariably traced to bad hygienic condi- .
X tions It is a germ disease and is almost impossible to guard against. Vie- (
Â° tims are so widely scattered that it is not easy to locate them and place
2Â» them under quarantine. . â¢".'-, m ' 'â¢.
Â° "It is essentially an infant's disease in this State and the average num-
X ber of deaths per month has been small. There are records of towns in the V
X East being almost depopulated of their children of school ago. owing to the (
0 ravages of the disease. The heavy rains of the past month should, -.in the
+ flushing of sewers, have removed the principal cause of the increase in ,
9 deaths, and the records of the Health Office will probably go back to the
Q normal rate."

TROUBLE BREWS OVER
CHARLES HIGHET'S BODY
CORONER HILL REFUSES TO DE
LIVER IT.
Relatives of the Dead Man Threaten
to Institute Legal Proceedings
for Its Immediate
Recovery.
Cormac & Donohoe, counsel for the
British Consul at this port, have notified
Coroner Hill that they will institute legal
proceedings against him to recover pos
, of the body of Charles I. Highet,
B itchman, who died in the Internation
rl Hi tel last Monday evening. Three un
dertakersâGray, Metzler and McAvoy â
claim the body, which is still in the
Morgue, having been embalmed by Mc-
At the time of Highet's death It was
Known that the deceased had an lnt< rest
in an estate in Scotland and that he had
well- to-do relatives in that country. \. n
dertakei McAvoy, whose turn it v.
be favored by the Coroner, was grven thj
tip, and lost no time in cabling to a broth
er of the deceased. On Tuesday morning
ai 4 o'clock McAvoy received a cables am
of -which the following is a copy:
AYR, Scotland, March 2Â».â H. B. McAvoy,
International Hotel, San Francisco: Bury at
once; cost JIOO. Write full particular*.
HIGHET.
McAvoy at once embalmed the body and
returned it to tlip possession of the Coro
ner at the request of the latter.
At P o'clock yesterday morning Coroner
Hill received the following- cablegram.
AYR. Scotland, March 29.â Place body of
Charles I. Highet at disposal of R. B. Hogue,
as he has my instructions as deceased's execu
tor. HlGHET
liot'iio called upon the Coroner yester
day with another telegram which he oaid
had been translated from the original
cipher corroborating the cablegram r< -
ceived by the Coroner. He asked that the
body be delivered to Undertaker Gray.
The Coroner refused to do so on the
ground that McAvoy had already em
balmed the body and that Hogue should
go to McAvoy and make his arrangements
with him. This Hogue refused to do. !â !,
did not recognize any one but the Coro
ner in the matter, the body being in his
possession.
Hogii.> i-aHed again at the Coroner's of
fice yesterday afternoon with Lawyer
Cormac and 'made a formal demand for
the body. He was Mgiun refused and Mr.
Hogue announced ih;it Cormac & Dono
ho<-> would at once institute legal proceed
ings against the Coroner. He contended
that the body was that of a British sub
ject and that the British Government
would have something to say about the
matt' r.
Earlier in the day King. "Ward <X- Co.,
proprietors of the International Hotel,
presented a demand on the Coroner that
the body should be delivered to Under
taker M'tzler, the deceased having been
indebted to them for board and room.
The Coroner Is awaiting the Inaugura
tion of legal proceedings and holds the
body for SacAvoy."
THEATER ON ' GEARY STREET.
Charles J. Behlow Proposes to Have
a Playhouse Facing Union
Square.
The destruction of the Baldwin Hotel
and theater has left a vacancy in the ten
derloin section of the city that has bo<^n
missed by the old patrons of the once
favorite Baldwin. To meet this apparent
want it is proposed to have a brand new
and modern playhouse erected on Geary
street, opposite Union Square.

th' w'iskr-rs iv Mac. W'y, Barneyll
lep into fame and fynances at wan fill
swoop. Th' luck some payple do bo
bavin', to be winsome and wealthy at
wanst. It's not nacheral."
Captain Wittman did not seem to
share the belief of Michael Joseph that
some ulterior agency was at work. He
was caught in his office behind a
screen, doffing his and getting
into his working .
"It's an aftermath of the annual pa
rade," ho said. "The officers of com
panies got away too quick -on that
day, and this is the first chance we
have had to get them all together
again."
No matter which is right, the confid
ing captain or the suspicious. Bergeant,
the group was taken and the forty
prize beauties are in it, as immortal
as any forty in the business. Their
names will pro down to posterity in this
style: Chief Lees, Captains Wittman,

years treasurer of the firm of H. I.

fortune in this business and, being also

the need of a new playhouse to replace
the Baldwin.

GOOD SEASON IS ASSURED
SACRAMENTO TO PLAY THE LO
CALS HERE THIS WEEK.
Oakland and- Santa Cruz May Go to
Watsonville for Their Series
â¢ Owing to the Havoc by
the Flood.
The managers of the California League
have every reason to congratulate them
selves on the opening of the season lo
cally last Sunday. The gate receipts at
Recreation Park amounted to as much as
on the opening day at Haight street after
â the famous season at Alameda, when
baseball reached the height of popularity
on this coast. In all the succeeding sea
sons until the close of the old grounds
there was never an opening day when
the receipts reached the total of that first
year. Recreation Park will seat many
more people than the Haight street
grounds would, especially before the
grandstand was remodeled, and though
the attendance will increase as the season
progresses, with a llrst-class quality of
sport, it is not likely that the crowds
will slop over so as to require the enforce
ment of ground rules, as was frequently
the case in the old days.
It was encouraging to see so many of
the old-time fanatics out again and shout
ing with all their former enthusiasm.
Menâ and women, tooâ who have not at
tended a game for several years were out
in force last Sunday and declared they
experienced just as much pleasure in the â 
game as they ever did.
Another good omen was the presence
of so many habitues of the race track
and coursing parks. It was thought by
many that the devotees of the horses and
dogs would rind little or no amusement
in the national game free from gambling,
as it is, after their long bout with the
bookies and pool boxes, but they did, and
they admitted that there was more real
sport in a good ball game than there was
in the best horse race ever run, even
though there was a chance to venture
some money on the latter.
It must be admitted that this renewed
interest in baseball is due in a large
measure to the confidence of the public
in the gentlemen who are now at the
head of the league. Henry Harris is un
questionably the best known and most
popular manager on the coast. He has '
always been known as an ardent sup
porter of clean sport and no taint of un
fairness, or worse, has ever fastened
upon him. His teams have always been
composed of the best material obtain
able and his men have played the Uest
ball they knew how. No shirking or jug
gling was ever permitted in his ranks,
and the fact that he is again in the game
brought out scores of veteran- cranks
last Sunday. Associated with him are j
J. T. Moran, who organized and con- j
trolled the famous Greenhood &
Morans of Oakland, from which some of :
the most famous players in the country
have graduated; Theodore F. Bonnet, the
License Collector, and Eugene F. Bert,
each of whom is a sufficient guarantee
that the game will be honestly and le
gitimately conducted while he is identi
fied with it. - â 
Under these most auspicious conditions
does the California League season of 1599
open.
Saturday and Sunday the Sacramentos
will play here against the locals, and al
ready there is much speculation on the
outcome of the series. The Capital Citys
are practically the same as they were
last year when they swept everything
before them. The San Franclscos met
with disaster last Sunday, but that does
not reflect discredit on them. On paper,
at any rate, the team is the strongest
that ever represented this city, and al
though the score shows fhey were weak
at batting on the opening day, they hit
the ball hard and often, but were unfor
tunate in not placing it safely. Besides,
the long rain prevented them from in
dulging In any field work to speak of,
which naturally affected their batting
eyes.
Manager Ewing of Oakland is plated
over his victory and declares there Is
nothing in the league that can touch his
team. He is scheduled to play with i
Santa Cruz this week, but the latter's
grounds are in such wretched condition
that it will be impossible to play on
them. San Lorenzo River broke loose
last week and cut the diamond and out
field all to pieces so that it will tane
some time to repair them. "Watsonville
will fro to San Jose for its first meeting
with the Brewers, and Ewing is anxious
to meet the Lobsters on Watsonville soil.
Tt is probable that this arrangement will
! bo made, though a big delegation of
â Watsonville Bnouters will accompany
their team to San Jose.

ALAMEDA COUNTY NEWS.
ARE LIVING
PICTURES THE
PROPER THING ?
Men of Christ Church
Horrified.
LADIES STAND FOR ART
PROPOSED SHOW EXCITES A CON
GREGATION.
Pt. Agnes Guild Prevented by the
Vestry From Giving Its
Contemplated Per
formance.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
142S Park street, March 29.
T l : ,< ladles and gentlemen of Christ
Episcopal Church have had a falling out
over the propriety of living picture exhi
bitions at church entertainments. Strange
to say, in the case at issue the ladies are
the advocates of the nude in art, while
the vestrymen, led by F. K. Mason of 1710
Everett street, are horrified at the idea
and think they could not witness such an
exhibition and live. The gentlemen blush
at any reference to the proposed enter
tainment, while the ladles look upon it in
c matu-r of fact sort of way and insist,
with much emphasis, that it Is the proper
. They blush also, however, but they
I their blushes are for the mock
Biy displayed by their co-laborers in
the church work.
St. Agnes Guild, connected with the
: Church, had undertaken tv give an
entertainment to raise funds to increase ;
i>ulk and general welfare of the i
church treasury. Among other talent the j
services were secured of Perham Nahl,
Ivlng picture artist. Nahl and his
partner, Giles Bradley, made a name for I
themselves In New York until Anthony
Cpmstock, like Vestryman Mason, became
Iced at their exhibitions, and New
York proved too small to hold them.
â¢ fthing was progressing nicely, with
Bed entertainment, when the j
chock came that spoiled it all and prompt- ]
lies to call It off. Tickets had
I a great number of th_(in
Fold on the representation that the Nahl
living pictures would be a feature of the
tmtne. The ladies made their mis- \
i advertising the Naiil numbers too i
promiscuously. As soon as the news
reached the delicate ears of the vestry
men they pronounced it "just tooawful for
anything," and forthwith took steps to
prevent the "horrid" pictures being ex- !
hibited at a church entertainment. At
request the rector. Rev. T. J.. Lacey,
called a meeting of the vestrymen. Mr.
Mason, strange as it may appear, did not '
attend. The ladles assert that the mere
mention of living pictures so shocked him
he could not undergo the ordeal of
ta-king part at a meeting where they were
nly subject under discussion. His
presence, however, was not necessary to I
draw the curtain on the display of' the
In art. Other vestrymen, of whom
n Drake was spokesman, covered
their blushing faces and cried out against
what they considered an immoral show
fraught with danger to the welfare of the- i
community.
And so Mrs. H. E. Osborn of 1014 Paru
t, president of the Ladies' Guild.
was notified that the living pictures '
would have to bn "killed." Mrs. Osbom
w;is astonished at the action of the gen
tlemen, and immediately railed a joint
meeting of the guild and the vestry to
discuss the propriety of living pictures.
The meeting was held Sunday evening
last. Mr. Mason was not present. The
ladies argued for their living picture
Fhow. hut the gentlemen could not toler
ate it. They may have occupied seats in j
"bald head row'> at a b-tlh-t show but
they drew the fine at living pictures i
especially when the exhibition was to bft '
given with a man as the central figure.
Thus it Is ihat th<- entertainment has
been declared g*f. The ladies decided that
f thf-y could not have "pictures that
lived" they would rnak>' no effort to add
funds to the church treasury. Xotice is
thai those who haw purchased
tickets i, ;n have their money refunded
!â¢> applying at the box office.
Mr. Mason was Been at his home this
evening and was not in ;i 'very pleasant
frame of mind. Tie refused to ea
his opinion en living pictures and would
neither deny nor affirm that he objected
to them being made a feature of a church
entertainment.
"I would give J2O for the name of the :
person who I^-t that secret out," said Mr.
Mason, and that was all he would con
sent to say.

PLEADING LONG
AND HARD FOR
BRANDES' LIFE
Defense Pins Fatth to
Dr. Woolsey.
HIS TESTIMONY THEIR HOPE
ATTORNEY BENNETT ARGUES
ON MEDICAL TESTIMONY.
Deputy District Attorney Melvin Ap
peals to the Jury for a Verdict
of Murder Without Rec
ommendation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway. March 29.
Juror Benjamin Marston having recov
ered, the noted Brandes murder trial that
has now dragged along for fifty days was
resumed this morning, Deputy District
Attorney Melvin concluding his argument
before the Jury. In conclusion Melvin once
more paid his respects to Dr. E. H. Wnnl-
Bey, chief medical expert for the defense,
and Witness .Vargas. Melvin declared
that this man Vargas, who had testified to
the bad reputations of some of the State's
winesses had dishonored the name of an
honest highwayman by attempting to as
sassinate the reputation of a living wo
man as Dr. Woolsey bad attempted to as-
Bassinate the good name of the murdered
girl Lillian.
The eloquent prosecutor branded the
story of young Milton Brandes, as told on
the witness stand, as "a cooked-up yarn"
suggested by his parents and recited par
rot-like by the boy, who was under their
Influence. He asked, under the evidence, I
that the jury's verdict be of murder with
out recommendation.
This afternoon J. E. Bennett comeneed
his argument for the defense, occupying
the entire afternoon, and announcing that
hÂ«< would most likely consume the entire
to-morrow, after which his colleague, P.
W. Sawyer will close for the defense.
Attorney Bennett's style of argument is
of the conversational order. His whole
argument to-day was based upon the al
leged soundness of the expert opinions of
Dr. E. H. Woolsey. For over three hours
he discussed minutely the pathological
conditions Involved.
One rather strange statement of Mr.
Bennett's, however, attracted unusual at
tention. He said that none of the testi
mony of the prosecution necessarily
showed that Brandes had killed his
daughter. "For." continued the speaker,
"he might have tied the apron around her
neck to cover up the crime of some one
else."
Mrs. Brandes' trial was continued for
another week.
MORE EVIDENCE OF
BRIBERY IS HEARD
GRAND JURORS NOW ON A POSI
TIVE TRAIL.
At Least One Man Will Have to Ex
plain How He Knew So Much
About the Jury.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 29.
The evidence of attempted bribery of
t lie jurors who tried the case of James K.
O'Brien, charged with felonious assault,
is gradually being unfolded before the
Criunl Jury. At to-day's session some poB-
Itlve testimony was heard which tends to
connect the name of a prominent busi
ness man with the alleged tampering with
jurymen.
.Martin Welsh, a saloon-keeper, who
was one of O'Brien's bondsmen, is* alleged
to have made some very peculiar remarks
in ;i Baioon during the progress- of the
trial. This conversation will be presented
to the Grand- Jury next Monday and tends
to show that Welsh waa very confident
of the manner in which the jury would
stand regarding a verdict. The man
whose name is mixed up with the affair Is
an <>ld friend erf Welsh and for a long
tune their business relations were very
close. To-day's session of the Grand Jury
whs very short and but few witnesses
were examined. Among them were M. < '.
Chapman and A. V. Mt-ndenhall, attor
neys. They explained to the Grand Jury
the hasty method In which the special
venire for O'Brien's trial was summoned
and how certain men actually placed
themselves in the wav of. Depii'tv Sher
iff Streightlff for the purpose of being
BUbpenaed. The Deputy Sheriff was given
1 half an hour to corral the venire and
| the attorneys informed the grand jurors
that to their certain knowledge some of
tlu talesmen gave false testimony during
their examination for trial Jurors.
It is believed that as a result of the in
quiry at least one man will have to an-
Swer to the court, if not for felony, cer
tainly for contempt, as there is .proof
that he did at least discuss the case with
| certain Jurors during the trial.
BIG STRIKE RECALLED.
Second Trial of Elliott Against the
Southern Pacific Company
Now in Progress.
OAKLAND, March 29.â 1n the trial of
the $20,000 damage suit of Samuel W.
Elliott against the Southern Pacific Com
pany, Master Mechanic McKenzie whs
again on the. witness stand to-day. By
tills witness the defense wished to prove
that if plaintiff sustained damage be
cause of the railroad's inability to run
a train from Oakland to Pleasanton in
July. 1894, it was unavoidable because of
the I>IR railroad strike at that time.
The remainder of to-day was occupied
with the taking of the testimony of Man
ager J. A. Fillmore of the South Pacific
Coast system. Fillmore. during the
strike, was general superintendent of the
railroad. Attorney Lezlnsky, on behalf
of the plaintiff, examined Mr. Fillmore
at great length relative to the methods
of running trains during the Mrike and
the failure to carry out the contract with
plaintiff as purchaser of a ticket calling
for a through fare from Pleasanton to
San Francisco.
The trial will occupy several days.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 30, 1899.
MR. SNOW SPOKE
VERY EARNESTLY
TO MR. CLEMENT
One Hundred People
Tremble.
GREAT RESULTS PREDICTED
â  NEITHER MADE AN EFFORT TO
CONCEAL THE AFFAIR.
I Several of the Councilmen Have
Ideas That They Will At
tempt to Carry
' Out.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 29.
The City Hall is on pins and needles
because Mr. Clement and Mr. Snow have
spent just twenty-three minutes in earn
est conversation.
This most surprising incident occurred,
yesterday afternoon in the City Hall
Park, and three seconds after the gentle
men had parted Police and Fire and
Street departments "were in a state of
great excitement, wondering what it all
meant.
The meeting: had as much significance
] to the City Hall as the meeting of two
Emperors might have on Europe. Mr.
Snow will become Mayor of Oakland next
Monday; Mr. Clement will be City Engi
neer. The two gentlemen between them
have the power, if they have the inclina
tion, to declare vacant and till fully 150
positions.
Mr. Snow is a Republican and Mr. Clem
ent a Democrat, and that causes the sur
prise, it is not in proof that they talked
about anything else than the sudden
change of weather or the recent rains,
but on the eve of taking office all sorts
of awful rumors are attached to their
meeting. The fact that these two gentle
men met in the City Hall Park apparently
by accident, where everybody could see
them, and if they cared to, could hear
them, does not seem to have entered into,
the calculations of the frightened 300.
Had the meeting taken place in the rear
room of a church or a saloon there might
have been some ground for misapprehen
sion, but excited office holders and place
hunters cannot be expected to talk, or
act Intelligently.
Should there be any combination be
tween any two of the three members of
the board it would naturally be between
the two Republicans, Mr. Snow and City
Attorney Dow. The probability is that
there will be no combination at all, and
that the department will In the main be
left undisturbed. But this reasonable
view refuses to commend itself to the
anxious 150.
Already some of the new Councilmen
are giving voice to their hobbies. Mr.
Girard will introduce a resolution next
Monday night aimed at keno playing. He
says Stockton and Sacramento have sup
pressed it and be sets no reason why
Oakland should not. He has been mak
ing investigations regarding the saloons
and back rooms where the game Is
played and is prepared to be very spe-'
cine Should he be appointed chairman
of the .License Committee something may
drop.
B. C. Cuvellier does not intend to ignore
the plank in the Republican and Munici
pal League platforms referring to the
ownership of a water plant by the city
oi Oakland. He says that he is deter
mined to bring about. If possible, a prac
tical scheme whereby the cost of water
will be materially reduced.
A great effort is being made in certain
quarters to induce Mr. Kowe, who will un
doubtedly be the president of the new
Council, to name Councilman-elect Schaf
fer as chairman of the Street Committee.
Much influence is being brought *o bear
to accomplish this appointment, which is
a very important one and involves th*
letting of more contracts than any other
single branch of the city government.
It seems to be generally acknowledged
that the new Council will appoint a new
wharfinger, although much depends on
the Oakland harbor bill now hung up in
Governor Gage's office. Should the bill
be signed, the. city will have no authority
to aoDOint a wharfinger, which appoint
ment will fall to the Harbor Commis
sion This doubt, however, has not de
creased the number of applicants to suo
ceed Fred Murdock.
John Wilds will probably retain his po
sition as chief lanltor of the City Hall,
but a big effort Is being made to remove
the night watchman, Tim Holland. At
next Monday's meeting of the Council
there will probably be many surprises.

FREED FROM A
DRUDGE'S LIFE
ON THE TRACK
! Pathetic Career of
Willie Mills.
NO BETTER THAN A SLAVE
HELD IN VIRTU AL* BONDAGE BY
A BOOKMAKER.
Justice Quinn Appointed the little
Fellow's Guardian and Will
Have Him Properly
Educated.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, March 29.
Willie Mills, to all intents and purposes
a white slave, appeared before Superior
Judge Hall late this afternon, and at the
14-year-old boy's request Justice of the
Peace J. G. Quinn was appointed his
guardian.
The lad Is a jockey at the Emeryville
racetrack, and few knew that he was the
rider of St. Calatine, which won the Hix
furlong event yesterday, lea\ing Foster's
fast Abuse in the lurch. The owner of
St. Culatine realized in the neighborhood
of $5000 on the result, because so little
faith was placed in the rider.
The career of the victorious young
jockey is pathetic. As an orphan, aged
9 years, he was taken in charge by the
Agricultural School of Illinois. Under an
indenture from that institution he was
turned over to a maji named Seller in
Chicago, this man representing himself as
a wealthy farmer, who agreed to educate
young Mills in agriculture. Instead, Seller
nut the boy to exercising race horses, and
later transferred the control of fhe lad to
Caesar Young, a bookmaker, then at St.
I.ouis, who a year ago last fall brought
thÂ«> boy West and put him to work at the
Emeryville track. There he learned to
ride.
Young Mills' condition of slavery first
at ti acted attention about six months ago,
when the boy appeared before Justice
Quinn, who then held court at Emery
ville, and exhibiting his right ear, half
torn off, and ugly bruises on his face and
head, complained that the foreman at the
stables had beaten him. The foreman was
arrested for battery, but before th>: trial
was commenced he filed a protest with
the Jockey Club against his young ac
cuser working at the trnck any longer.
The protest was subsequently withdrawn
on condition that the case against the
foreman be dismissed, and It was.
Since then Justfce Quinn ha^< been Inves
tigating Millti' antecedents, ills investi
gations revealed the true state of the lad's
slavery. A friendship sprang. up between
the Justice and the boy. and a few days
ago the indenture issued by the Agricul
tural School of Illinois was canceled at
the request of Justice QuJnn. The boy, in
the hope of regaining his liberty, request
ed Justice Quinn to act as his guardian,
and the latter accordingly applied for let
ters, which Judge Hall granted before
court adjourned.
Justice Quinn promises to see that his
new charge Is properly educated anil
reared, but not in the ways pf the race
track.
GOOD LUCK IS WITH
T. H. BLYTHE'S CHILD
WINS AN IMPORTANT CASE IN
THE SUPREME COURT.
Florence's Guardian Had No Right to
Incumber the Estate â Twenty-
Thousand Dollars In
volved.
Mrs. Florence Blythe-Hinckley must
have been born under a lucky star, for
she seems to be successful in everything
in which she is interested. Her last suc
cess was the winning of a lawsuit in
which $20,000 was involved, action for thar.
amount being brought against the estate
which she inherited from her deceased
father, the late Thomas H. Blythe.
In 1889, while the Blythe estate case was
still pending In the courts, James Crisp
Perry, as guardian of Florence Blytho
and hor estate, entered Into a contract
with George P. Goff, an attorney, where
by it was agreed that Goff should prepare.
?" d Â¥ { v " lish to lIH young lady's attorney,
v . H. 11. Hart, a brief on her part on the
question whether or not she had been
legitimated under the laws of this State
It was further agreed that in considera
tion of this service and when she had
been Legitimated by Goff and she came
into possession of the property, Goff was
to be paid out of the estate a reasonable
compensation for preparing and furnish
ing the brief.
He fulillled his obligations under the
contract and before the death of Flor
ence's guardian, Perry, in 1891, he gave the
brief to Attorney Hart. For this service
Goff demanded as his compensation $20 -
000 after the case was decided in favor of
the dead millionaire's child. The court
was asked to decree that this was a just
claim for the service rendered and that
it be declared a lien upon the real prop
erty. Aft.r this action was begun Goff
died, and Harry N. Morse, as adminis
trator for defendant's estate, was sub
stituted as plaintiff. Subsequently an
amendment was made to the complaint
to the effect that after making the ton
tract between Goff and Perry, as guar
dian of Florence and her estate, it was
agreed and understood that Perry should
in no way become personally liable.
To this complaint as amended a demur
rer was interposed specifying as grounds
thereof that fhe amended complaint did
not state facts sufficient to constitute a
cause of action; that it did not appear
that any order of the Probate Court had
even been made or obtained authorizing
Perry as guardian or otherwise to enter
into the contract alleged, and that the ac
tion was barred by the provisions of sec
tions 337. 339 and 343 of the Code of Civil
Procedure. The lower court sustained
the demurrer without leave to amend and
judgment was entered for the defendant
An appeal was taken and judgment of the
lower court was affirmed. The Supreme
Court says:
"It nowhere appears therefrom that the
brief was even accepted by the leading
counsel or used in the settlement of the
Blythe estate, or that It aided the de
fendant in the least in obtaining the judg
ment of the court establishing her heir
ship and by which judgment she succeed
ed to the possession of the property of
the guardian has no power without the
order of court to Bell or incumber the
property of his ward. â¢ â¢ â¢ The con
tract, as alleged in the complaint, which
assumed to incumber the property of the
ward without an order of the Probate
Court is invalid. This renders It unneces
sary to consider the statute of limitations.
Judgment affirmed."

DEMOCRATIC CENTRAL CLUB.
Literary and Musical Entertainment
for the Members.
The Democratic Central Club met last
night in Pythian Castle, Oscar Hocks pre
siding. A very large and enthusiastic au
dionte had gathered to listen to the ex
position of Jeffersonian principles. Sena
tor R. Porter Ashe spoke of his labors at
Sacramento and of the value of organiza
tion as a means to success. Robert Fer
rall. one of the oldest warhorses in the
party, brought tears to the eyes of his
listeners. Reel B. Terry told the story of
Cleveland's ajid Carlisle's betrayal of the
party in the election of 1596 and of the
lonely life now led by Mr. Carlisle in the
city of New York, forsaken as he is by
all his former friends.
Charles Edelman, twice a candidate for
the nomination for the office of State
Treasurer, who is a resident of Orange
County and the possessor of an orange
grove, spoke of the loyal devotion of his
better half to the principles of the Dem
ocratic party, said devotion consisting in.
her covering up the entire grove with
green cloth on St. Patrick's day.
M. Greenblatt. who missed by a few
votes being called to take charge of the
municipal strong box, spoke on national
matters and deprecated the war now be
ing waged in the Philippine Islands by
Maxim guns and modern rifles against
bow and arrow.
Edwin Booth Ryan recited the wrongs
the late Shamus O'Brien suffered at the
hands of perfidious Albion during the
dark days of '98.
Vocal and instrumental selections kept
the audience in good Uumor throughout
the entire evening and a plentiful supply
of steam beer, sandwiches and cigars
tended to cheer the Democratic heart.
On Thursday evening next, April 6, the
club will entertain Hon. James G. Ma
guire at a banquet.
IMPORTERS REJOICE
OVER A NEW ARRIVAL
APPRAISER LUNT TO SETTLE
DISPUTES.
San Francisco, the Second-Best Reve
nue Port in the United States,
Should Have a Permanent
Appraiser.
"Wilbur F. Lunt, a member of the Board
cf General Appraisers, arrived from New
York yesterday for the purpose of making
an examination of disputed appraisements
and of passing judgment upon the sain-.
For some reason not at all comprehend
ed by the human intellect, all the nine
members of the Board of General Ap
praisers are kept in New York City, an 1
all appeals from appraisements made in
any port in the United States are pa.ssed
upon by the board. In the case of San
Francisco. 3000 miles from New York,
there is oftentimes much delay in having
the appeals decided. There are a large
number of these appeals from San Fran
cisco on the file, and the, importers, wish- i
ing to expedite matters, requested Col
lector Jackson to ask that a member of
the board be sent to this city to settle the
appeals without further delay. In re
sponse to the suggestion of the Collector,
Appraiser J,unt has been ordered here,
and the importers are happy.
Collector Jackson says that San Fran
cisco is the second port of importance
and revenue in the United States, and
that a General Appraiser should be sta
tioned permanently in San Francisco for
the b< nefit of the Importers and the ex
pediting of their business.
General Morales' Widow Is Here.
Mrs. Natalia do Morales, widow nf j
General Prospero Morales, who came very j
near upsetting the government under I
President Barrios, arrived in the city yes- |
! terday morning- on the steamer City of !
Sydney. It will be remembered that j
Morales was a fugitive from the Gov
ernment and was found dying in a cave
on the Mexican frontier.
After the defeat of the revolutionary
army and the flight of General Morales,
Mrs. Morales was in hiding for some timo
at the Mexican legation. After Presi- '
dent Barrios' death Mrs. Morales was 'â 
treated with great consideration by Presi- j
dent Cabrera. The lady was allowed to ;
I pass at will through the country, and
j she- came to this city, where she will re
| main a while for her health.
May Taber Returns From Guatemala.
Miss *May Taber, who recently acquired
considerable notoriety in this city by
having her name linked with General
Barillas in various sensational episodes, i
arrived from Guatemala yesterday on the
City of Sydney, and went immediately to
San Mateo with her mother.
Miss Taber has been a resident of "La
I^ibertad," one of General Barillas' coun
try places, for the p;;st two years. She
has been enjoying herself to the utmost
In the southern villa, but she finally de
cided to return to more congenial shores.
It is said that the jealousy ;l nd enmity of
Mme. Barillas was the cause of her
leaving General Barillas and the coun
try home. Things became so warm for
th" fair Pan Franciscan that she decided
to leave Central America forever.

CLUBMAN OVERBOARD
IN A HEAVY SEA
TOM DWYEii HAS A NARROW
ESCAPE FROM DEATH.
He Was Sinking Under the Weight
of Extra Clothing When
Caught With a
Boathook.
Thomas B. Dwyer, a deputy In the Tax
Collector's office, residing at t 844 Bay
street, had a narrow escape from drown
ing yesterday morning in the open sea.
With a number of Olympic Club friends
Dwyer formed the fishing party that left
this city early in the day on A. Paladin!
& Co.'s tug the Henrietta. Outside the
heads they encountered rough water,
which grew rougher as they proceeded
down the coast. The members of the fish
ing party, some of whom were not sea
soned salts, had a pretty rough time, but
none of them got the dose that came to
Dwyer.
In some manner that he cannot explain,
he was caught in one of the heavy seas
the tug shipped and swept overboard. He
had on a large pair of rubber boots, a
heavy coat and an overcoat and was in
a fair way of sinking from the weight
of this clothing, when the engineer of
the tug managed to catch him with a
boathook.
When Dwyer was drawn aboard the fug
he was pretty far gone, and It was more
than an hour before he regained con
sciousness. During the remainder of the
day he was decidedly seasisk and re
turned to the city very weak, but other
wise none the worse for his mishap.

GAGE WILL NOT CALL
AN EXTRA SESSION FOR
ANY PURPOSE WHATEVER
Governor Thinks the Legislature
Should Have Elected a Senator
at the Regular Time.
HE WILL SIGN NO MORE BILLS
Does Not Believe in the Australian Ballot,
and Signed the Rickard Bill to Improve
the Present System.
THERE will be no extra session of the Legislature to elect a United
States Senator, nor for any other purpose. On this point Governor
Gage is firm and positive. Speaking on this topic yesterday at the
Palace Hotel he said:
# "You can say that all the talk about an extra session of the Leg- 4
Â± islature is ridiculous and utterly absurd. Ido not mean to say that
there are no conceivable conditions under which an extra session
T might not be justified, but I cannot imagine any possible reasons '
Â£ for calling' the legislators together for the purpose of electing a (
Senator. When it is considered that the Legislature was in session
for nearly three months and failed to make a choice, even after I '
a urged in a message the great necessity for agreement on the Sena-
torship. what sense would there be in calling the members to
â¦ gether again P An extra session is not to be thought of, and all the
f talk about the calling of one is ridiculous." (
So far as the signing of bills is con
cerned the Governor finished his work
at Sacramento night before last. No
more bills will be signed. Appropria
tions amounting in the aggregate to
t-, 500,000 were involved in the unsigned
or pocketed billi.
Governor Gage was asked if he in
tended to sign bills other than those
approved up to the time that he left
Sacramento for this city and replied
that his work on bills was completed
and that no more would be signed.
"I feel now," continued the Governor,
"that I am entitled to a season of rest.
I am going south and will not receive
letters, telegrams or applications per
taining to official business until 1 re
turn to Sacramento."
Governor Gage spoke his sentiments
freely on subjects connected with the
Stratton primary law, the Rickard bill
and the Australian ballot. He re
marked: "It may be observed that I
signed all the bills relating to elections
that the Legislature passed. I am not
myself an advocate of the Australian
ballot system, and I cannot say that I
am favorably impressed with the Strat
ton primary law. According to my way
of thinking the best primary is the old
fashioned town meeting, where every
voter interested in nominating candi
dates can get up and speak his senti
ments. The Rickard bill was among
EXECUTED BY
ORDER OF COURT
Fate of a Dog Tfyat Bit the
Leg of cl. T. Carbeiry,
a Carpenter.
IT Is necessary for the protection of
citizens," said Judge Mogan yester
day, "that all vicious dogs should
be killed, and now I order that the
Jog in question be executed at the
jublic pound according to law."
The dog was said to belong to Mrs.
R. Block, who lives on Van Ness ave
nue, near Fulton street, and was a
favorite with the children in that lo
cality. Last Friday night J. T. Car
berry, a carpenter, living at 311 Oak
Btreet," was walking along Van Ness
"avenue, and while passing the dog it
seized hold of the calf of his left leg.
He ascertained who the reputed own
er of the dog was and called at Mrs.
Block's house. He notified Mrs.
Block's daughter that If the dog had
left any mark upon his leg he would
Insist on its being killed. When he
reached home he had ample evidence
of the fact that he had been bitten,
and next day went to get the dog so
that he could have it killed. He was
told that a lady across the street had
got the dog and she would not con
sent to its life being sacrificed. Car
berry notified the Poundman and the
dog was captured and taken to the
pound, but the officials declined to kill
It without an order of the court.
Carberry accordingly swore out a
warrant for Mrs. Block's arrest.
the election measures recommended for
perfecting the election system and I
approved, it."
The fact that the Governor had ar
rived from Sacramento and was at the
Palace <|Hotel was communicated early
yesterday morning to a large throng
of politi< lans and at once there was
eager Inquiry as to whether the chief
executive intended to sign measures
other than those reported in The Call
yesterday morning. Many persons in
terested in applications for official fa
vor sought for personal interviews with
the Governor, but he declined to re
ceive cards or callers on patronage
business.
It is understood that he will take a
good rest in the south and when he
feels refreshed will proceed again to
Sacramento and take up the subject of
patronage distribution. Many Repub
licaÂ»s are kickinsr because Democrats
continue to hold desirable places under
a Republican administration, but the
dispenser of the spoils is not inclined to
make . special haste to gratify the
clamorous.
Governor Gage, accompanied by his
wife and daughter, left the city last
evening on the "owl" train for Los An
geles. During the afternoon he met
many of the politicians and office-seek
ers in the court of the Palace, but the
meetings were open and informal.
That was the story told by Carber
ry in Judge Mogari'^ court yesterday.
Mrs. Block, who was defended by At
torney Brandon, denied that she was
the owner of the dog and said it be
longed to her daughter, Ethel. She
had never known the dog to bite any
one and it was a favorite with chil
dren.
Secretary Holbrcok of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Ani
mals then took a hand In the pro
ceedings. "1 appear for the dog," he
paid, "and I want it to get a fair and
square trial. Of course, if the court
orders the dog to be killed I shall do
bo on receiving the usual request from
the Chief of Police; but it should not
be condemned to death till its guilt
Is thoroughly established."
In answer to the Judge both Mrs.
Block and her attorney said they had
no objection to the dog being killed,
but the difficulty arose as to whether
the real owner would have any objec
tion. The Judge said he would have
to .dismiss the case against Mra.
Block and Carberry could decide as
to whether he would have Miss Block
arrested. Meantime he made the or
der that the dog be executed. Car
berry said he was satisfied and would
not proceed against Miss Block. The
dop was a victim to Illuminating gas
at the pound.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MARCH 30. 1899.
AMPLE LIGHT
AT LOW- BATES
IS ASSURED
Householders Rejoice
at the Prospect
RAPID WORK PROMISED
CLAUS SPBECKELS IS DIRECTING
THE AFFAIRS.
He Is Convinced That the New Plant,
While Affording Relief to the
People, Will Prove a Fine
Business Investment.
The incorporation of the Independent
Electric Light and Power Company
was the talk of the town yesterday
and special gratification was evinced
by householders who have been paying
excessive rates for very little light. The
idea that Claus Spreckels had decided
to establish a new and ample plant for
the generation of light and power in
order to even up on some corporations
Is altogether erroneous. The plain fact
is that he is a man of affairs, whose
capital is ample and whose business af
fairs are in such excellent shape that
he can give much of his personal at
tention to the building up of a new en- j
terprise. His experience in conducting
a small plant and his knowledge de
rived therefrom of the cost of produc
ing electricity convince him that light
and power can be profitably afforded to
the people of San Francisco for a very
much lower figure than is now charged
for these commodities.
The truth is that San Francisco for
many years has been paying two prices
for an indifferent service in the man
ner of lighting the streets and dwellings
of the city. It did not escape the keen
observation of a capable business man
like Claus Spreckels that new inven
tions and tested methods for the gen
eration of light and power had mate
rially reduced the cost of producing
these necessities of modern life, and
having money for investment arid de
siring to invest his money in home en
terprises, he embarked in this project
to establish in San Francisco an exten
sive plant for the production of electric
light. Xo doubt the investment will
prove highly remunerative to Mr.
Spreckels and his associates and at the
same time afford a vast measure of re
lief to the people of this city.
The promoters of the new enterprise
were busy yesterday with experts and
engineers and will be engaged for sev
eral days in the -work of inspecting and
discussing plans. The more the sub
ject is investigated the clearer becomes
the conviction that the field of invest
ment is one of the best.
Mr. Spreckels Is quite enthusiastic
and active in the new enterprise and
will BUrely display his customary ener
gy and decision in pressing forward the
work of constructing the great plant.
As the money required is ready to sec
ond his personal energy the people of
the city can be assured that the day of
high prices and indifferent light service
is vanishing.
WE MUST BE BORN
AGAiN, SAYS MOODY
THOUSANDS LISTEN TO AN IN
SPIKING ADDRESS.
Arrangements Made for a Union Bi
ble Class to Meet Every Tuesday
Evening in Y. M. C. A.
Auditorium.
"The New Birth" was thÂ« subject of
Mr. Moody's stirring address, which was
closely followed by the Immense audi
ence that filled every seat and occupied
every inch of standing room in the audi
torium of the Y. M. C. A. yesterday
afternoon. Laughter and tears were very
near to the surface, and assembly and
preacher smiled as they wiped away
tears that came at the command of the
Inspired speaker.
Mr. Moody chose as his theme the third
verse of the third chapter of John, "Ex
cept a m;tn be born again, he cannot' see
the klne-dom of God." The speaker said
in part: "Are we born of the Spirit,
are we born from above, are we
born again? Let no man tell me
he is so naturally good that he
need not be born again. Corruption
runs In the blood. Grace does not. Be
cause a man comes from a godly family,
that is no sign he is godly. We are
naturally bad. Man has a falling nature.
What we want is man rejuvenated. All
our trouble comes from the heart. May
God give us a revelation of ourselves so
we may look into our own hearts. Let
the heart be right and the whole life will
be right.
"No man can serve God in the flesh
unless he is born of the Spirit. The new
birth is- not making new resolutions or
turning over a new leaf. To be a new
birth it must be from God. Get 'the In
corruptible seed which is the work of
God' into your life and that is the new
life."
Previous to his address Mr. Moody
spoke of the immense good that might
be accomplished by the establishmbent of
a union Bible class in this city â a sug
gestion that was immediately acted upon
by the vast assemblage. It was arranged
that the newly organized class meet
every Tuesday evening in the Y. M. C. A.

Dan Sullivan Injured.
Dan Sullivan, a solicitor for the Ameri

Alabama street, met with a severe acci
dent last Tuesday. While riding in his
buggy at the Potrero his horse shied at
some imaginary danger and upset the ve
hicle, throwing Sullivan out. When picked
up it was discovered that he had been
severely injured. He was conveyed to
his home and medical assistance called in
to administer to his wants. An exami
nation showed that two of his ribs had
b<;en broken and he received other in
ternal injuries of a serious nature. The
buggy was smashed into kindling wood
and the horse injured.

A JOKE THAT ENDS
BADLY FOR A BOY
C. Jackson Stole a Pig in Butel?
ertown and Was Caught
Wtyle Returning It.
r> HARLES JACKSON, Robert
Hansen and John Limartini, boys
I, about 15 years of ago living in
the neighborhood of Stockton
and Chestnut streets, went out to
Butcherto-wn Tuesday afternoon with
no definite purpose hi view. Hansen
was the moneyed one of the trio and
defrayed the carfares for himself and
two companions. They wander<> i
around till the shades of night began
to fall, and as they passed the ranch
of John de Sant,i, Eighteenth avenue
and Eighth street, and saw several
pigs in the barnyard, it occurred to
them that it would be a good joke to
Bteal one of the pigs. While Hansen
and Limartini kept watch Jackson
climbed over the fence and took pos
session of one of the pigs.
What to do with it was the next
problem that confronted the boys.
They got on a car, and on the way
home it was unanimously agreed that
Jackson was entitled to the pig. He
took it to his aunt and made her a
present of it. When she learned that
it had been stolen she was indignant
and insisted upon the boy taking it
back to where he had stolen it. He
did not like the job, but when his
aunt threatened to notify the police
he gave in, and putting the pig in
a sack started on his journey to the
ranch. He had no money to pay

A Plan to Destroy Them and Raise

fortable Struc

Supervisor Holland, chairman of the
Building Committee, and Supervisor Att
ridge of the Hospital Committee held a
conference yesterday regarding the Pest
house. They determined after discussing
the matter in its various phases to visit
the institution Saturday. At that time
they will determine what the require
ments of the place are, which findings
they will report to the board on the fol
lowing Monday.
Superintendent Thompson, who has had
charge of the construction of the Hall of
Justice, has been in consultation with the
committee having the matter in charge.
He has advised that all the. buildings now
In use be destroyed by tire and a smaller
structure erected. The present ramshac
kle affair is larger than need be for the
unfortunates quartered there and serves
only as ' the abiding place of disease
germs.
Mr. Thompson believes a substantial
building, suitable for the needs of the af
flicted lepers, can be built at a cost not
to exceed $1000. This would give. shelter
from the elements which the buildings
now in use do not pretend to do. The
Supervisors have aM entered heartily into
the humanitarian plan of relieving the
great distress of these wards of the mu
nicipality and any measure proposed by
the gentlemen having the matter in
charge will be passed upon favorably and
without delay.
The publication of the facts as to con
ditions as they exist out there on the
edge of the South San Francisco marsh
has caused much comment and the evi
dent desire at the present time is to cor
rect the lapses of former administrations
with as little delay as possible, to the
end that the inmates be subjected to no
more suffering than is necessary.

"BATTLE OF MANILA BAY."
A Magnificent Panoramic View of
Great Fight Now in Course of
Construction.
Within the next two weeks residents of
this city and vicinity will be given an op
portunity of attending one of the grandest
| panoramas ever exhibited in this country.
j "The Battle of Manila Bay" is the sub
| ject of the stupendous venture which Is
I now in the last stages of construction in
: a large octagon building on Market street,
near Eighth. Aside from its artistic value
it will show those who visit the exhibi
tion under what conditions Admiral
Dewey won his splendid victory.
Standing on the circular platform in the
center of the interior the visitor tsmomen
tarily startled at what confronts him. It
is like being on the bridge of a ship and
gazing far out into the sea. Water sur
rounds you on every side, and when you
recover from your surprise your eyes
take in the beautiful scene. The forts of
Manila, Cayite and surrounding points are
seen tiring on Demy's 'fleet, which is in
the foreground. Immediately before Ca
vite can be seen the Spanish war vessels
responding to the heavy Hru being poured
into them by the American ships. Hut it
in only through an opera glass that the
liner points of the magnificent canvas can
be appreciated.
Armed with a glass the spectator can
see the green shores of Cavlte, the effect
of the American shot on the Spanish fleet,
the admiral leaving the destroyed Reina
Christina, and hundreds of other interest-
Ing incidents of the big light.
In the foreground is the Olympiu and
Admiral Dewey and his gallant officers
are easily distinguished on the bridge.
The painting of each figure is lifelike and
can be at once recognized. Each object
In the vast stretch of canvas is interest
ing and demands a close study. On the
Raleigh the sailors can be seen cheering
the effects of a good shot and also a
smashed boat and a sailor climbing aloft
for the purpose of securing the halyards
of the flag which have been shot away by
flying missiles. The Baltimore. Boston,
Concord and Petrel each have .interesting
features and a skilled lecturer will point
them out when the panorama is formally
opened.
.The painting is a faithful reproduction
of the most interesting stage of the bat
tle. When completed It will cost in the
neighborhodd of $100,000. It is being con
structed under the direct supervision of
William Wehner.

There is no doubt that when completed
