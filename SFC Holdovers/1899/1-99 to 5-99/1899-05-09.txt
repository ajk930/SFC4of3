TRADE WAR
WITH GERMANY
IS IMMINENT
Dispatch to Tl
NF.W FORK, May B.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent telegraphs:
Commercial warfare between Germany
and th.- United States is made Immi
nent by the action of the German
Reichstag in reporting a bill unfavor
able to the importation of American
meats into the empire.
The executive ''ran'!.'- of thn two
Governments are both anxious to avoid
any clash over the matter. The Ger
man Emperor and President McKinlev
are working by diplomatic means to
bring about better commercial relations
between the two countries, but the dan
ger is that the Emperor cannot re
strain the Reichstag, which seems to
be under the control of Agrarians, and
if the meat bill, as reported from the
committee, is enacted into a law tht-n
--is danger that when Congress meets
next December retaliatory legislation
will be proposed.
It will b,e recalled that when trouble
with Germany over the San Jose scale
occurred bills were introduced in Con
providing for retaliatory legisla
tion, and among leading members of
the House Committee on Ways and
M- an? there was serious talk of a dif

CHRISTIAN
SCIENTISTS
ARRESTED
Diepatcb to The Call.
NEW YORK, May B.â Coroner Ban
ning and a jury this afternoon and
evening held an inquest at Mount Ver
non into the death of Mrs. Charlotte WE.
Barguet, who died on Wednesday last
of dropsy, and whose life, it was
claimed, might have been Bayed if she
had been given medical attendance.
The authorities claim she was treated
by <"hristian Science methods and that
the neglect resulted in death.
The jury handed in a verdict to the
effect that Mrs. Barguet died from
acute dropsy, which could have been
relieved if not entirely cured and life
prolonged had proper medical treat
ment been given. The jurors held that
Mrs. Clarence Fowler, the Christian
Scientist who treated the woman, Lis
ton B. Barguet Jr., her son, and Miss
Ethel Karguet. her daughter, were
aruilty of negligence, and recommended
that the Coroner take the proper steps
to punish them.
Coroner Banning accepted the verdict
and immediately announced that he
was sitting as a committing magistrate
and directed the constables present to
arrest and bring before him the persons
held responsible by the jury. The Coro
ner then announced that he would hold
Liston Barguet Jr. and Mrs. Fowler to
await the action of the Grand Jury,
under $1000 bail each or they would
stand committed to the County Jail at
White Plains. In the case of Ethel
Barguet he would hold her as an ac

FAVOR DIRECT
POPULAR VOTE
FOR SENATORS
Special Dispatch to The < "rill.
NEW York, May B.â A Richmond
<Ya> special t" the Herald says: As
a result of the <nll Issued by fifty lead
ing Democrats of the State a conven
tion <>f representatives of that party
will be held here Wednesday for the
purpose of adopting such measures as
may be deemed best to promote the
election of Senators of the United
States by direct vote of the people, and
until that result is accomplished the se
lection of party Senatorial candidates
by some popular method.
The movement which led to the call
ing of this convention is the direct out
come of the defeat of Fitzhugh Lee for
United States Senator in 1894 by
Thomas 8. Martin. General Lee was the
popular choice and had the represen
tatives in the Legislature voted as in
structed by the local conventions he
would have been chosen Senator. The
election of Martin, a railroad attorney
not known to the State at large, caused
general dissatisfaction. It was chareed
then, and i* believed by many now.
that railroad influence and use of
money defeated the popular will.
Since that time there has been a
growing sentiment in favor of electing
United States Senators by popular vote.
At the State Democratic Convention in
August a resolution was introduced
providing f"r the nomination of United
States Senators by primaries. Senator
Daniel opposed this with all his mieht
in the interest of his colleague. Coun
ty delegates were almost unanimous in
favor of the move, but Senator Daniel
was a popular idol.
A resolution had just been passed de
claring that the convention would n.-t
support any man who did not favor the
re-election of Daniel to the Senate, and.
on the plea that the people should have
time to talk the matter over, the reso
lution was defeated, bat the question
would not 'down, and the coming con
vention will represent the long pent ud
sentiment of the people.

ENTER A MOST
GIGANTIC TRUST
Scheme of the Allied Forces
of the Vanderbilts and
J. Pierpcnt Morgan,
STOP RATE CUTTING
Plan to Form a Combination of
Traffic ob All Lines Between
Boston and Chicago-
The Vandarbilt family, already the
largest holders of railways in the
United States, allied with J. Pierpont
Morgan, reorganizer of disorganized
and overcapitalized railways, have
taken the first step looking toward the
promotion of what is, in effect and
in despite of the Interstate Com
merce law, a railway trust.
Special Disjiat.-h to The Call.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, May 7.â The
Leader will say to-morrmv: Ac
cording to a high official of the
Vanderbilt lines in this city the
details of a big railroad trust,
which is to include all the lines between
Boston and Chicago, are now being,
worked out and the consolidation may ;
be completed within th~ next few
weeks. The recent purchase of short
lines in New York, Pennsylvania. Ohio,
Indiana and Illinois was in line with
th<- plans for the consolidation which
has been in contemplation. It is not
the purpose to have all the lines under,
one management exactly, but t<> appor- '
tion them among me Pennsylvania
company, thi- Vanderbilt interests and',
the Baltimore and Ohio Company when
it shall have been reorganized, giving
to each system the lines that it can
use t< the best advantage.
The JJrst inkling the scope of the
plan came,. when the "unierbilts an
nounced the other day that they con
trolled all the roads in New England
with the exception of the Boston and
Albany, with which they have now a
traffic agreement and which they ex
pect to take in soon. The Vanderbilts
now control all the trunk lines between
Buffalo and New York with the excep
tion of the Erie, the Lackawanna and
the Lehigh Valley. The Erie, it is
said, will come under the control of
the Vanderbilts through ; the influence
of the Morgans, while the Lehigh Val
ley may go to the Baltimore and Ohio.
The Lackawanna is now operated in
connection with the Nickel Plate, a
Vanderbilt line.
West of Buffalo the Vanderhiits have
the Lake Shore, the Nickel Plate, the
f'itisburg and Lake Erie, the Big Four, ;
the Michigan Central, which, with the ;
Flint and Pere Marquette. that is soon
to be absorbed, will give a line in
Michigan. The Big Four west is to be
operated in connection with the Monon,
recently purchased by the Morgans, and
the Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton is!
expected to be absorbed' soon. The Lake
Erie and Western, acquired by the Mor
gans, is expected to give the Vander
bilts a line from Sandusky to Peoria,
111. These roads, with the Hocking Val
ley, the Ohio Central, the Columbus,
Sandusky and Hocking, and the De
troit, Lima and Northern, will about
complete the Vanderbilt system.
The Pennsylvania, which has an im
mense system already under its con
trol, is expected to acquire the Cleve
land, Akron and Columbus, with which
it ha.^ a traffic arrangement at pres
ent, the Wiit Â»-ling and Lake Erie, the
Cleveland. Canton and Southern and
the Ohio Southern, as well as sonn
minor lines.
To the Baltimore and Ohio Is allot
ted the Lehigh Valley, the Cherry
Creek road, which with the Philadel
phia and Reading would form a
through line from Pittsburg to NV\\
York, the Baltimore and Ohio South
western, giving a line to Cincinnati
and St. Louis: the PMttsburg and West
ern, the Cleveland Terminal and Val
ley and the Northern Ohio, opening
short lines through from Pittsburg
and Cleveland to Chicago, as well as
the Cleveland, Lorraine and Wheeling.
These are the outlines only of the plan
which is now being worked opt, but
those who have been watching the
changes in the railroad world do not
doubt that it will be carried through
successfully.
The purpose of the consolidation is
said to be to prevent rate cutting and
to accomplish practically what the
Joint Traffic Association was or
ganized to do.

CAPTAIN GRANT of the Utah Artillery.
Captain Grant's Expedition
Successful at Sesmoan
and Guagua.
pecial Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899,
by James Gordon Bennett.
MA XI LA. May 8. â Captain Grant, with the army gunboats
Laguna de Bai and Covedonga. started yesterday from
Manila to find a means of communication by water with
San Fernando. He found the mouth of a river due south of Ses
rrioari and reached that town through insurgent obstruction at
noon and there found deep water.
From some strong trenches for half a mile along the shore
the insurgents poured a sharp fire on the ironclads. They re
plied with all their guns, driving out the enemy. The gun
boats then steamed up the stream to Guagua, reaching there
at I o'clock. The insurgent. Governor came down to meet the
Americans, declaring he did not desire war. The insurgents,
when leaving the town, set it afire, but the flames were put out
by the Americans.
The river is thought to be navigable for launches clear to
San Fernando, where a new base of supplies can be established,
with water communication with Manila.
The Filipinos surprised the United States forces at San
Fernando with a daring trick yesterday. A railway train with
an engine at each end was run almost to the American out
posts and in plain sight of the town. Before they could be
reached a gang of natives sprang off the train, tore up several
lengths of the railway track, boarded the train again and
steamed away so quickly that there was no opportunity to cap
ture the raiders.
The Nebraska Regiment is asking for a temporary relief
from duty. Only men of this regiment are left at the front.
NEW YORK, May S.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent
sends the following: While the
insurgents have so far been
successful in eluding the American
columns, another effort has been in
augurated in this direction by Generals
Mac Arthur and Lawton. which will re
sult th- authorities hope, in the cap*
ture or destruction of a strong wing of
the insurgent army.
To this end a military movement is
now in progress which contemplates
the surrounding of a large section of
the enemy believed to be encamped to
the westward of San Fernando. The
expurgations made in General Otis'
cablegram to-day are understood to re
fer to the movement now under way.
It is stated in well-informed official
circles that the insurgents who are the
objective of the present campaign are
to the northward of Bacolor, and it will
be the effort of General Mac Arthur to
go to the north of them and drive them
to Manila Bay, while General Lawton,
with his column, will take a position to
reinforce General Mac Arthur on the
east, and at the same time take meas
ures to protect his communications and
keep General Luna with his insurgent
troops in check.
"I am hopeful that the movement
will be successful," said an official with
whom I talked this afternoon, "and
that a large number of Insurgents will
be (antiireci. Every native taken is
surprised at the lenient and considerate
treatment extended to him and be

REAR ADMIRAL WATSON
ORDERED TO JOIN DEWEY
WASHINGTON, May 8. Rear Admiral Watson will relinouish com
mand of the Mare Island Navy Yard immediately, and will sail
frcin San Francisco for Manila on May ic.
Secretary Long said to-night that Roar Admiral Watson would
not succeed Admiral Dewev as a member of the Philippine Com
mission.
"The admiral will remain in Manila until the commission's work is com
pleted," he continued. "He is too Important a member to be immediately re
il#ved. It la of .-ours.- impossible to state when the commission will close up
its work, that being dependent upon the time when the insurrection will be
brought to an end, but when the admiral determines to return he will turn
immand to Rear Admiral Watson, who has been directed to re
port to him."
The orders to Rear Admiral Watson are due to intimations received from
the admiral of his desire to return to the United States and of the renuest of
the former officer to be assigned to duty as the next commander in chief of
the Asiatic station.
Rear Admiral Kempf, at present on waiting orders, has been ordered to

Philippines. In fact, there is strong
ground for tho belief that it was writ

ANDERSON SPEAKS OF
TACTICS OF FILIPINOS
CHICAGO. May General T. M. An-
I derson, who led the first military expedi
tion to ihe Philippines, formally assumed
' command to-day of the Department of
i the Lakes, relieving General Sheridan,
j who will serve on General Anderson's
j staff as adjutant general. In speaking of
i the situation in the Philippines, General
I Anderson said he was confident that the i
i backbone of the Philippine rebellion will j
I ultimately be broken, but perhaps not so
I Boon as was hoped. With the mountain
i ous character of the country and the .
! fastnesses of the interior affording nu
! merous refuges for guerrilla parties and i
| bands of outlaws, he says, there is every ,
I inducement for the Filipinos to keep up I
a harassing campaign against the Ameri
can troops.
"The leaders of the Malolos government
are ambitious and unscrupulous," said
General Anderson.
â¢"The reason they wish for independence
is that they desire to gain control of the
forfeited church property of the Spanish
Government, which is very valuable, and
of all Spanish concessions and dispose of
them to their own advantage. By Spanish
I concessions I mean charters for water
works, tramways, electric lights and other
corporate interests. They know that the,
treaty with Spain compels our Govern-
I ment to respect all corporate and treaty
I rights.
"Although Aguinaldo has the confidence
i of the people and commands a large fol
lowing among the natives, yet he is not '
â  the real head of the rebellion there. He
is pushed forward and his popular char
acteristics made use of by the Malolos 1
Junta. I personally often came in con

LETTER TO ATKINSON
FROM ANTI-IMPERIALISTS
BOSTON, May &.â The executive
committee of the Anti-Tmperialistic
League to-day adopted the following
letter to be sent to Edward Atkinson:
: The executive committee of the Anti
imperialistic League thought it proper to
privately communicate at once to the
same persona to whom, as you advised us
April 22, you had written to express your
Intention of mailing your pamphlets to
soldiers in the field, that the league did
not desire to circulate its literature in
this manner. Inadvertence in expression,
doubtless accidental, othewlse conveyed,
to the recipients of your letters the Im
pression that you had forwarded the
league's publications for their distribu
tion.
What difference of opinion may exist
as to the propriety of the circulation
which you suggested (but which we
understand has not been attempted) there
should be only one opinion as to the far
more serious Issue which has been raised
by your experiment of sending copies of
your pamphlet only to Admiral George
Dowry . President Schurman, Professor
Worcester, General Otis, General Lawton.
General Miller and .1. H. Bass, the cor
respondent of Harper's Weekly, and
which was reported to have been taken
from the malls by the order of the Post
master General.
leral Miller and .1. H. Hass, the cor
iondent of Harper's Weekly, and
â¢h was reported to have been taken
i the mails by the order of the Post
ter General,
Against this act or arbitrary and illegal
power, which would hardly be attempted
by any government of Europe except per
haps that of Russia, the league calls on
all good citizens to protest as a serious
blow to republican institutions, which
are now so gravely threatened by Imperial
policies at home and abroad.

been between JSOOO and $7000."
Jockey Clawson was under a threo-y>ar

the boy's release, and before the Jockey
Club considered the rase his transfer
papers had been signed and registered
with the club.
Mr. Paget, having no entry In the Met

SPREAD OF SMALLPOX
DECLARED UNLIKELY
Result of Dr. Mathews' Investigation
at Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
SACRAMENTO, May B.â Dr. W. P.
Mathews, secretary of the State Board of
Health, has returned from Los Angeles,
where he went to investigate what threat
ened to be an epidemic of smallpox. When
interviewed regarding his trip Dr.
Mathews said the people of Lop Angeles
were alarmed for fear the disease was be-
Ing brought in from Arizona, and asked
that the quarantine be looked into. The
doctor found that there were two cases
in the city at the time, both of which
were in the families of railroad men. He
Investigated these and came to the con
clusion that they were cases of old in
fection. He does not consider that there
is any danger of further spread of the
disease.
The doctor said there was considerable
alarm in the San Francisco Board of
Health concerning smallpox. A case wan
brought In on the troopship that brought
General Harrison Gray Otis from Manila,
and there is fear the disease may spread.
The ship has been ordered back into
quarantine and the doctor does not think
It will spread.
BRAVE VICTOR DUBOCE
HAS BEEN MADE COLONEL
SACRAMENTO, May B.â Governor Gage to-day appointed Lieutenant
Colonel Victor Duboce to be colonel in command of the First Califor
nia Regiment of Volunteers, at Manila. Colonel Duboce will succeed
to the office made vacant by the promotion of Colonel Smith to a brig
adier generalship. â¢
Victor D. Duboce, who is promoted to be colonel of the First California In
fantry Regiment, United States Volunteers, is a gallant and worthy officer.
He began his military career in the National Guard of California and
served with distinction as a line, staff and field officer of the guard. Before
the war with Spain was declared he had attained by gradual advancement
the rank of lieutenant colonel In the regiment which he n ow commands.
When volunteers were called for he was one of the first to respond and
signify a desire for active service at the front. In the spirited engage-'
ments of the Manila campaign he was a conspicuous figure. He won com
mendation for bravery and skill from his superior offldfers.
Colonel Duboce is a good citizen as well 'as a good soldier. He is an act
ive member of Golden Gate Commandery, Knights Templar, and to his en
ergy much of the success of the organization is due. When the war came
he surrendered a g<>od position with one of the leading real estate firms of

less invalid. The complaint, alleging

divorce. It is Bald the trial may be held

though she is sensitive regarding the I
making public of her marital troubles.

berry's attorneys have not decided
whether or not they will ask for a pri
vate trial. \

CORNING COMPROMISES.
Pays Price Demanded by Sailors to
. Avoid Further Delay.
ASTORIA. Or.. May The hearing un- i
der the writ of habeas corpus brought
for the release of the twelve sailors who !
were placed on the British bark Howard
D. Troop from the steamer Columbia last
Friday was resumed before Judge Gra>
to-day. As to four. of the men, who were
admitted to be American citizens, the |
court decided they could not be held orÂ»
an English ship and ordered their dis
charge. The examination of the other
sailors was continued until to-morrow.
The case of Captain Corning of the
Troop, on the charge of kidnaping, was
called in the Justice's court, but was con
tinued by consent of counsel, the four
sailors being released under the habeas
corpus being held under bond to appear
as witnesses against Corning. -â  â  '
The report is current to-night, however,
that all disputes between the ship and
boarding-house people have been satis
factorily adjusted and' the men not dis
charged under habeas corpus will he re
turned to the ship and further proceed-
Inga In the courts dropped. What the
terms of settlement are to be cannot be
learned, but it is believed Captain Corning
has paid the price demanded for the sail
ors rather than be subjected to any
further vexatious delay.

Senator George C. Perkins, who is seeking
to have the State delegation organize for
harmonious and united action in Wash

owing to seniority in service, be elected
chairman. One of the first matters to
be considered is the question of census
patronage, as the bureau has taken the
southern counties of the Sixth and Sev

Sixth census district, creating the Seventh

SUITS AGAINST
YUBA OFFICIALS
The Grand Jury Advises
Prosecutions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MARYSVILLE, May B.â The Grand
Jury of Yuba County, which, aided by
an expert, has been making official in
vestigation of the books and records
of the county officers since November
last, has filed a second partial report
and adjourned to meet at the call of
the foreman. As it became mooted
about that there would be some start
ling disclosures in this report, its filing
was looked forward to with much in
terest. The report of the expert, H.
H. Love of Palermo, accompanies the
document, which is quite lengthy.
Love reports that during the years
1895, 1896 and 1897 the sum of $1?,952 15
has been paid out of the county treas
ury without authority of law. In this
amount is included $7437 50 paid for the
service of agents of the Anti-Debris
Association, an institution that looks
to the interests of the valley counties
in the fight against hydraulic mining.
He charges that the members of the
Board of Supervisors are in debt to
the county of Yuba in the sum of
$3903 39 for money drawn from the
treasury on personal claims and on
claims allowed various livery stables
for livery hire for the Supervisors' per
sonal use. He finds that the Supervis
ors have been allowing several county
officials to present claims for extra
services rendered, especially for work
connected directly with their offices.
These claims aggregate $735 50.
Demands presented by the Horticul
tural Commissioners he declares
doubtful from a legal standpoint, as
the commission was, in his opinion,
not legally created.
The Board of Supervisors is accused
of having allowed claims that con
tained errors, overlooking the errors
through carelessness.
The jury recommends that the Dis
trict Attorney be instructed to com
mence suits for the recovery of all
money illegally paid out. It denounces
the practice of the Supervisors in al
lowing demands to themselves for sev
eral different services on the same
day; also of allowing their own per
sonal claims without submitting them
to the District Attorney, as required
by law.
The Supervisors are censured for the
discourteous manner in which certain
members of the board treated the ex
pert during the time of his investiga
tions, by turning off, the gas so that
he would not be able to work during
the night and by refusing to pay his
claims presented monthly or entering
on their minutes their reasons for do
ing so.
A change in the management of the
hospital is recommended.
The report of the expert is to be
printed and circulated among the tax
payers.

FRENCH DEPUTIES
IN AN UPROAR
Statesmen Talk of the
Portfolio Changes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, May B.â ln the Chamber of
Deputies to-day M. Georges Berry,
Nationalist, representing the Ninth
Arrondissement of the Seine, questioned
the Government as to whether the
resignation of the portfolio of war by
M. de Freycinet was due to a disagree
ment by the Minister and his col
leagues, or if M. de Freycinet had re
signed because ho wished no longer to
protect the chiefs of the army.
M. Berry also asked why the port
folio of public works had been given to
M. Monastier, who had voted against
transferring revision of the Dreyfus
case from the Criminal Court to the
whole Court of Cassation.
The Premier, M. Dupuy, replied that
the motives which M. Berry alleged
were purely imaginary. There was not
a shadow of disagreement, he said,
within the Cabinet. Regarding Monas
tier, M. Dupuy said his appointment did
not indicate any change on the part of
the Government regarding the revision,
which, moreover, could not be regarded
as the privilege of Republican policy.
M. Lavaye, Nationalist, inquired if
discord in the Cabinet was not due to
the exchange of sharp letters between
M. de Freycinet and the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, M. del Casse, concern
ing the Palealogue incident.
Amidst a great deal of uproar M.
Dupuy replied that the suggestion was
unfounded.
M. Lavaye interjected that M. del
Casse was the possessor of cheeks in
capable of flushing, even from smacks.
Great uproar and excitement ensued.
Finally M. Lavaye was formally cen
sured and the subject was dropped for
the order of the day, which the Govern
ment accepted. The vote was 444 to 67.
M. del Casse entered the Chamber of
Deputies after the vote on the order of
the day had been taken and made a
statement corroborating what had been
said by Premier Dupuy, adding that it
had needed all his self-sacrifice and
â¢ otism to accept the management of
foreign affairs in the circumstances un
der which he had taken office. He be
lieved, he said, that he had served the
country well. The statement was re
ceived with hearty cheers.

CORBIN SAVES
THE PRESIDENT
Prevents Injury From
Runaway Horse.
Special l>lspatch to The CalL
WASHINGTON. May B.â President
McKinley had a narrow escape from
being run over by a horse this after
noon. He was out walking with Adju
tant General Corbin, and as they
crossed. Pennsylvania avenue, near La
fayette Square, a hurst.- attached to a
light buggy, which had been standing
by the curb, became frightened at
something and ran away. The Presi
dent and General Corbin were talking
and neither of them saw the horse ufj
til he was nearly upon them. General
1 !( rbin pulled the President out of the
way just in time to save him from be
ing struck.
President and Mrs. McKlnley left the
city to-night for a vacation of a week
or ten days at Hut Springs, Va. The, 1
trip was made in a handsc/mely equip
ped special train, which left here at j
'j-.ij o'clock over the Chesapeake and
Ohio Railroad and is scheduled to ar
rive at the springs about 8 o'clock to
morrow morning. The President and
.Mis. Mcfdnley occupied the private
car Cleopatra, which was attached to
the rear of the train, the remain.:
the special being made up of the com- j
partment car Patagonia and the com- ;
blnation smoking and baf ir At
lantic. The party included also Get Pge
B. Cortelyou, the assistant secretary to
the President; Dr. and -Mrs. Dixey,
Mr. Barnes of the White House clerical
force. The President's health Is -
but he feels the need of rest and ra
tion, and hence all of th>- business dur
e will be
far as possible at the White House.
While at the springs the party will stay
at "The Homestead," where Secretary
and Mrs. Gage are now . . for a
week's stay. Secretaries Alger and
Wilson and Adjutant General Corbin
a few friends were at the station
and remained until the train departed.
NEW rORK, M rding to
ispatch to the Herald from YVash
â  . tin-re is ii" foundation for the
sensational stories Bent out from that
city that the President is in wretched
health. It is true he has suffered from
neuralgia recently, but when he left
for a two weeks' outing at Hot Springs
to-night he looked well and seemed
Drtght and cheerful as usual.
One of the principal reasons why the
President and Mrs. McKinley have
.chosen this time to take a vacation is
that improvements are being made in
ih" sanitary arrangements of the ex
â  â¢ mansion. Workmen, under the
I Colonel Bingham Su
â nt at Public Buildings and

a thorough overhauling of its sanitary

LOS ANGELES, May s.â Antonio Pico.
nephew of the late Governor Pio Pico,
while on trial for burglary has been de

the asylum at Highlands. Countess Jo-
sepa I'ico de Gottliebron, who has been a

proceedings in Judge Smith's court this

As Pico was committed to the asylum
while charged with a crime, it is not im

th<- probable effect upon the.' position
of Secretary now held by Peter J.

that the new board will affect Mr.
Shields' tenure, although it is pointed
out that he has the friendship of mem- j
bers of the l..,ard of politics differing^
from his own. and that nobody who !
has yet been named stands as good a

occupies. Shields is said to be on quite
friendly terms with Governor Gage,
and it is not known that the latter
had the matter of the secretaryship in
mind when he named the new directors.

some that the Governor will really have ,
the naming of the secretary.
JUDGE HUTTON'S AMBITION.
Candidate for a Place on the Supreme
Court Commission.
LOS ANGELES, May B.â Los A' -
has a candidate for the vacancy in the
Supreme Court Commission in the person
of former Superior Judge A. YV. Hutton.
Judge Hutton lias the backing of every
lawyer in the city for the position. The
leaders of the liar arc especially anxious
to have him appointed. The vacancy was
caused by the death of Commissioner E.
J. Pringle of Oakland a few weeks ago.
Th. position, which pays $^h,Â«i ;v year, is
practically for life. tJnder the law the
appointee must lie v Democrat. Judge
Hutton last year could have had the
Democratic nomination for District At

for several days he declined the honor.

Santa Clara Good Government League
Presents Claim Against
Supervisors.
SAN JOSK. May little harmony
prevails between the Board of Supervi
sors and District Attorney Campbell. A
number of bills against the county are
.it the bottom of the trouble. Behind
Campbell is the Republican Good Govern
ment league, which seems determined
to wauh over county affairs.
Pome time ago the league decided to
look into the expenditure of county funds
by the Supervisors. It found where the
Supervisors had put in bills for attend
ing State conventions of Supervisors and
for other official tips. These bills were
merely for hotel expenses and railway
fan s. The law does not provide fur
these, however, and the league banded
the bills to District Attorney Campbell
for collection against the Supervisors.
Supervisors Austin. Stem, Roll and Rea
have received two bills each, with the re
quest that they refund the money drawn.
Supervisor Aver has not yet received his.
The Supervisors have refused to allow
two bills from Campbell's office and
claim t!n-y are exorbitant. One is for $110
for typewriting done by Argylo Campbell,
an IS-year-ola son 01 the District At
torney, and the other for %tii~<> for type
writing done by Miss Faulkner, a sist>r-
In-law of that official.

said that if there was any surprise
that a stranger should be the oralor
on such an occasion as this, it must be
remembered that Joan of Arc not only
belonged to France, but to the human
race generally. After a eulogy on
Joan of Arc, Archbishop Ireland said
that he was happy to seize the occa
sion to tell of his unspeakable affec
tion for France, which was the land of
his youth and the school of his soul.
After the oration a cortege proceeded
to the site of the old fort of Tournelles,
which was captured by Joan of Arc on
-May s, 1429. The procession included
officials of the department and city,
the fire brigade and many civic socie
ties. The route along which the pro
cession passed was lined with troops.
Afterward the cortege returned to the
cathedral, where a Te Deum was sung.
To-night there were fireworks and a
torchlight procession.
OPIUM SEIZED BY
PRISON GUARDS
San Quentin Convicts
Foiled.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
sax qi-kntin, May s -The dili
gence of Captain of the Guard Birlem
and three of his men led to the discov
ery to-day of an extensive plot to
smuggle opium into the penitentiary.
The discovery was made by accident
and the officers secured nearly ten
pounds of the drug. Two convicts who
â i as ringleaders in the plan to
bring in the contraband article are
shackled to the walls of the dungeon
to-nisht. and about twenty others will
receive lighter punishment.
Ever Bince the Legislature made it a
felony to bring opium upon the prison
grounds the "dope fiends" have given
a good deal of trouble, and a few have
had to have medical treatment on ac
count of th" scarcity of the drug. To
day they were all in good humor in
expectation of their latest plot proving
ssful. Captain Birlem scented
danger and cautioned all the guards to
be vigilant.
About sixty-five m^n work daily up
on th. Tiburon boulevard and are
known as th<- "road gang." They have
lately been under the charge of Guards
A. (J. Kelly, George WHey and J. I).
Jones. For the past few days these
guards have noticed that some person,
presumably an ex-convict, was skulk
ing in the brush near the scene of the
work. To-day "Cage" Wilson, a pris
oner serving a lung term for a bur
glary committed in San Francisco, was
ted by Guard Kelly in the act of
removing a Quantity of opium from a
tan buried close to the boulevard. Wil
son was searched after a severe strug
gle, the other prisoners being prevent
â¢-(! from going to his assistance only by
the threat that they would be shot. A
quantity of the drug was found con
cealed in his shoes and hatband.
The men were then marched in and
searched at the tower gate. About
twenty had opium concealed on their
parsons, the total quantity aggre
gating nearly ten pounds, in weight.
enough to have kept the prison well
supplied for a month or two. Wilson
and Al Young, his "pal." who is serv
ing seven years for grand larceny in
Los Angeles, were placed in the dun
geon and the others will be punished
as the Prison Directors may decid.-.
Captain Birlem took the opium found
to-day and all that discovered during
the last three years out into the bay
in a small boat this evening, and at
taching weights to the large packages
cast them into the water. There was
so much opium that only one assistant
could be taken in the boat.
HOGELSBURG SAYS HIS
WIFE IS INNOCENT
LOS ANGELES, May B.â Dr. Hans
Hogelsburg of New York, who as the
fugitive president of the Investors'
Guarantee and Trust Company of
Wi st Virginia, was arrested here last
night, is held under specific in
structions from Captain McCloskey of
the New York police department, who
says in his telegrams that an officer
[â¢â¢ft New York last night with a certi-
Sted copy of the complaint sworn to by
Ernest May, alleging that Hogelsburg
obtained $8100 of his money. Hogels
burg was seen to-night and admitted
that he had used the money supplied
by his customers.
"I have not one dollar," said Hogels
burg, "of the capital of those who re
sponded to my advertisements. It is
all in New York and passed out of my
possession."
"Was it taken from you?" was asked.
"Not at all," replied Hogelsburg. "It
was lost in the last squeeze in Wall
street. I played the market at both
ends. First I went "long" and then I
went 'short' in the hope of making a
big winning, but the whole thing
proved disastrous and that is the end
of it."
"Why did you leave suddenly, doc
tor?"
"That was my mistake," he replied.
"I should have remained in New York
and faced the situation. That would
have b>'en better. I am perfectly will
ing to return to New York, and will go
at any moment without legal formal
ity. I want to exonerate my wife, who
has no guilty knowledge of my trans
actions. I kept her in ignorance."
Dr. Hogelsburg has in his possession
a mass of canceled checks, but is
without money. His wife and child
are supposed to have met him here
after he passed through Los Angeles,
went to Mexico and returned here a
few days ago.

the defense read a question from the

the ground that there was not sufficient
proof of the identity ol Mrs. Murdock.
Attorneys Lusk and Johnson became
belligerent. Johnson said plaintiff declined
to be present at the taking of new depo

order to assist in identification, but â¢would
agree to pay the expenses of these wit

in court. Lusk then said that If plaintiffs
counsel would admit that a photograph

would he taken at once. This was de

MARGUERITE LINDLEY,
ENEMY OF KISSING
CLEVELAND, 0.. May B.âMarguer
ite Lindley. the enemy of kissing, is
here from New York to attend the In
ternational Woman's Health Protective
League. Miss Lindley says kissing is
extremely dangerous to public health.
i She said many New York papers had
i misquoted her in the discussion of kiss
' ing.
'I did not say I had never been
kissed, as there was no occasion for
such a remark," smilingly said Miss
Lindley. "The papers say I am in favor
of the passage of a law to prohibit kiss
ing, which is absurd, of course, and
said I said in my address to the House
hold Economic Association in New York
I had never been kissed. They quoted
me as saying I had never let any one
kiss me, and that I should not let any
one if he tried. It is true I believe kiss
ing Is dangerous. A friendly grasp of
the hand is enough for me, but I never
said I had never been kissed."

Blood Cure Sent Free
A Free Trial Treatment Sent Privately by Mail to All Who
Suffer.
A Remarkable Remedy for a Terrible Affliction â The Cure Is
Permanent,
A free trial treatment is being s^-nt out I
by tile State Medical Institute in ordei j
to demonstrate the fact that the most
horrible of all diseases can be cured.
There is a good deal of controversy over >
this subject amc who declare the
disease incurable, but the facts are in-
dubitable and must be acknowledged. The
action of this new remedy is peculiar. The
physician In charge of the Institute has
had a long and varied experience treating
this disease of the blood, and about two
yean bifb, after a long series of experi-
ments he found the exact specific that
offsets the poiKon. renders it lifeless and
eliminate it from the body. Having per-
â¢sonallv examined many hundreds of cases
and familiarized "Himself with every de-
tail of the disease, bis discovery came
naturally and has never failed him. One
of his recent cures was a most hopeless
ense the diseas.- having caused the hair
to fall out and the body was one mass of
Diitrescent sores, boils, blotches and un-
Pightlv disfigurements. In ten days the
entire outer skin was healed and there
the citizens of this region I want to call
your attention to some matters which at
this writing occur to my mind.
Are you aware of the fact that your cor
poration was freely given substantial
rights and privileges by our citizens? when
the railroad was first built in this region
in 18S7?
Were you ever informed that the Com
mon Council of the city of Santa Barbara
bestowed upon your corporation without a
dollar's expense one of the city plazas,
situated near your freight depot in Santa
Barbara, which afforded you terminal fa
cilities, the purchase of which would have
cost you many of your good American
dollars?
You are doubtless aware that what is
known here as the Citizens' Right of Way
Committee procured for your corporation
and freely bestowed upon it the right
of way extending, with a few trivial ex
ceptions, continuously from near the city
of Santa Barbara to the northern limits
of this county, a distance of seventy or
eighty miles, absolutely free of charge
upon .1 promise distinctly entered into by
your corporation about the year ISB7 that
the railroad would be completed up the
coast and Santa Barbara would have the
advantages of a direct and shorter route
to the city of San Francisco within a com
paratively brief timeâ l think two years
was the limit set by the directors of your
corporation.
Are you aware of the fact that your cor
poration is now running its daily trains
over at least two strips of land within
my own knowledge for which the repre
sentatives of the railroad agreed to pay
the owners the price of $40 per acre and
for several years past that promise has
not â¢en fulfilled?
Do not imagine, Mr. Huntington, that
the citizens of Santa Barbara who think
for themselves attach any value to your
threat of a suspension of the work. Those
of us who have observed the "signs of
the times" know full well that your pur
pose is, or ought to be, to complete the
coast line as expeditiously as possible in
order to reduce your fixed charges and
cost of hauling by taking advantage of
the more direct line, which in gradiance
and natural features will permit you to
haul freight from Los Angeles by the
coast at a much less cost to the corpora
tion than you are now hauling it over the
almost prohibitive grades at the Tehacha
pi. We also believe that the contract en
tered Info by your corporation and the
Santa Fe system, by which the common
use of both roads of the track from Mo-
Jave to Bakersfleld is to be maintained in
accordance with the traffic carried over
it by each, means when Interpreted that
as ion as you have completed the more
economical and natural highway upon the
"new coast line" that you will abandon
all use of the mountain section on what
is now known as "the old line up the
valley," and leave your friends from Bos
ton to foot up the bills for the permanent
maintenance of that' track, so that the
profits of your own corporation may be
thereby prudently and judiciously in
creased.
Believing thai tins.- truths must abso
lutely control your conduct in tin- man
agement of the vast system which you
have so successfully developed do not
think our citiz< - that any action
of theirs in maintaining their rljrhts and
nting your corporation from having
i;s own way in ali things, will force you
t.. commit the fundamental error of aban
g ili,' completion of the gap after :i!l
financial arrangements have been com-
I biriiliiiK contracts entered into
by your corporation with thosi who are
railroad now in course of
construction.
In conclusion I desire to express to you
my personal thanks for this opportunity
expt ise your unhappily con
ceived "bluff." At the risk of alluding to
Â eel with which you may not be en
miliar I cannot refrain from
stating that in the language of the green

THE POPE WORKS HARD.

I mean a man who is out of bed and at
work at ," ..'clock in the morning-. He
a light breakfastâ a little very
weak coffee with plenty of milk, and a j
piece of br^ad. He works, reading or
writing, and receives some visits, until 1
lunch time. In the afternoon he takes
walk, and when in ordinary health
sp.-mls some time In the gardens of the j
Vatican; then he returns to his an**rt- j
ment, where Ik- says his rosary. He may j
then receive a ,few visitors, after which
he takes a nap and dines. At in p. m. he
reads the newspapers and then retires
f.>r the night. The Pope thus really >
works all day long, and latterly he has
n nourishment four or five times a
bui always "f a light characterâ a |
little tTKat. soups, bouillon, a trlass or two

which forms the larger part of his .li. t.
During his recent illness verj little med
icine was given him: the physicians re
lied principally upon rest, nourishment
and stimulants every now and then, but |
always in small quantities.
Tin' Pope's nervous energy, as already
. in a previous letter, is something
remarltabie in one of his advanced years,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 9, 1899.
WOULD GIVE DEWEY
A GRAND RECEPTION
ADMIRAL DEWEY is to be invited by the industrial and commercial
bodies of this city to return to his home in the San Fran
clsco, At n meeting of the Chamber of Commerce this afternoon a
resolution will be Introduced, and without doubt be passed, calling
upon all kindred organizations to join In the Invitation.
According to recent dispatches from Washington the hero of
Manila Bay is very likely to be called home as soon as the situation In the
Philippines will warrant his absence. It' would seem the most natural
course for him to take to make the return trip by way of this city, but for
some reason the chances are that he may go to New York in his flagship
Olympia via the Indian Ocean and the Suez canal. Whether this route Is of
his own selection or has been determined by the Secretary of the Navy is
not known. That San Franciscoâ in fact, the entire coastâ desires to pay
tribute to the man who destroyed the Spanish fleet which a year ago was a
menace to. the entire West goes without saying, and none appreciate what
was done by Dewey more than those who had and have commercial interests
in the Pacific.
The first to make a move toward arranging for a reception fitting to the
man ami the occasion is the local Chamber of Commerce ami. as stated,
the matter will be taken up at to-day's meeting. "The stumbling block to
beginning the move," said Secretary Scott,' "is the lack jf knowledge as to
the correct course to nursue. It may be that the Secretary of the Navy
directs the route for the coming and going of the officers of the navy, and I
believe that Secretary Long reserves this right to himself, and it may be that
Dewey, being an admiral, will select his own route. If the latter is the case
it mi^it be taken as a slight to send any word to the Secretary of the Navy.
If. ot.^ihe other hand, Secretary Long is the right official to address with a
requeif that he favor the Pacific Coast by having Admiral Dewey come home
by this route lie might feel that he had been overlooked by having the mat
ter presented to Dewey first. While I cannot say what action the Chamber
of Commerce will take with the proposition it is a foregone conclusion to
my mind that the ball will be set in motion. The subject will likely take the
form of a resolution expressing our wishes and the appointment of a commit
-i â¢ what the right course is to pursue. After that is ascertained we
will urge all commercial, industrial, social, fraternal and patriotic bodies in
general to co-operate with us to make the reception a success."
P. W. I'ohrmann, president of the Merchants' Association, stated that
as soon as the first move is made toward giving Admiral Dewey a reception
he will lay the matter before his association, feeling confident that this body
will heartily join in the move to make the admiral feel that his greal s< r
vices in ridding the waters of the Pacific of the Spanish fleet are fully ap
preciated. The project has been discussed in quite a number of organizations
and there. is but one sentimentâ go ahead and the procession that will follow
will be the grandest that San Francisco lias ever seen. The Mayor of the
city, although not here at present, is heartily In the move. Intimate friends
state that he will gladly '.end hiÂ« help and influence in extending as hearty
an invitation to the admiral as any one could desire.

from the man whose name she still

The marriage of Dunphy and Miss
Howard was a most romantic one.
The young couple quietly, in June,
1897, Blipped down to San Jose,
Where they were wedded, returning
immediately after to their respective
homes in this city. Five months later
the news of their marriage was made
public. The union proved a most un
happy one. and in November. 1888,
the young wife was granted a divorce
on the ground of cruelty. Shortly
after her divorce Mrs. Dunphy adopt

ADOLPH SPRECKELS SECOND
FOUR FAVORITES TUMBLED
OVER AT OAKLAND.

Youngsters Over the Line.
Sly First Again.
On Saturday last, when the outside
public backed Stamina to beat Daisy F,
the Duke & Wishard colt made laborious
work of it and was downed in a gallop
by the mare. Yesterday this same out
side public spread its coin about on Cor
rigan's horse Adolph Spreckels at very
short odds to win the mile and a furlong
selling run, and Stamina disposed of him
like breaking eggs. The one thing t'> !>â¢
regretted was that Dasiy F was not again
a starter. The winner to all appearances
received no great amount of backing
here, going to the post at odds of 7 to 2.
There is an apparent paucity of coin in
the ring, the ten pencilera not being over
whelmed with business. Festoso and May
W were the only winning favorites.
Johnny Reiff carried off the saddle hon
ors by piloting three horses past the wire
in front.
Dcvereux. the Puryear P Colt which
cleverly defeated a big field on Thursday
last, was made favorite for tho opening
two-year-old scramble, and though put
ting up a good race was beaten l>y two.
Bamboulia', away well, led throughout,
beating the fast coming Rachel C a
length, stepping off the five furlongs in
1:02%.
The favorite Festoso. with Jenkins in
the saddle, was successful in the five and
a half furlong dash following. Catching
Solstice less than a sixteenth from home,
the Wildidle colt won by a couple of
lengths. Pompino, backed from 15 to 8,
finished third.
Marcelles, a handsome looking mare by
Morello-Mercedes, entered by Earnshaw

Catastrophe for the maiden race. She

E. B. REYNOLDS, Pioneer Sea
Captain, Dies of Heart
Failure. ;
IN the death of Captain Edward B.Reynolds, which occurred yesterday '
morning at an early hour at his residence, 515 A Jones street. another well- '
known pioneer and character of the early days of California passed away. ;
Captain Reynolds died at â¢; o'clock, and while the cause of his death is '
directly attributed to heart failure, he had been in failing health for several '
months. '
Captain Reynolds had been a sea captain for over thirty years, and no sea- '
faring man was better known or more highly respected upon this coast than
the deceased. Last August he took the barkentine Kate Davenport with coal
for the Government to Honolulu, and while there he contracted malarial '
fever. He returned to San Francisco in October, and from that time he has [
been failing-. |
The deceased was born in Boston. Mass.. August 7. 1819. He came to \
California in 1549. Directly after arriving here he engaged in mining and was (
prominently Identified with the early history of the State, being one of the (
famous Vigilance Committee for the preservation of law and order. In. the (
early fifties Captain Reynolds entered the service of Meiggs & Gawley and i
ran between this city and Port Madison. While engaged In the transportation <
of lumber for this firm he established for himself a name for sobriety and (
ability that was very unusual among sea captains. A prominent pioneer <
said yesterday that he never heard of Captain Reynolds having used a pro- <
fane word. After Meiggs & Gawley failed Captain Reynolds entered the <
service of Renton & Holmes. In the service of this firm he sailed along the <
coast and often even to Honolulu and Australia. He remained in the service <
of the latter !irm until last fall, when his declining health forced him to (
retire. (
Captain Reynolds was a prominent member of the Society of Pioneers. (
He was also a prominent Mason and was a member of Golden Gate Lodge. (
In IS3I he married Harriet L. Hedges of Massachusetts, and he is survived <
by her and two children Edward 11. Reynolds of Seattle and Mrs. Mary (
B. Holmes of Adams, Mass. . (
The funeral will take place at 2 o'clock to-morrow from the Masonic <
Temple, and all the old Pioneers requested to attend and to wear the â <
customary badge of mourning. When* the news of Captain Reynolds' death i
was reported at Pioneers' Hall the flag over the builfiing was placed at half- (
mast in his honor. â¢ â '.'.

cated a more definite teaching of â â â¢â hies in

ward In most intense agony.
About three years ago Mrs. Ryan fell
and injured her head. Since then she has
developed symptoms of dementia and has
often acted strangely, it is supposed that
while laboring under some hallucination

FROHMAN SENDS
FINE PLAYERS IN
A FAIR FARCE
"On and Off" Notable
for the Acting.
GREENE'S JAPANESE WIFE
AN AFFECTIONATE MOTHER-IN
LAW THE NOVELTY.
"Little Tycoon" at the Grand â Maude
Adam's Successful JulietâOpen
ing of the London
Opera.
The play is not the thin;; at the Co
lumbia Theater this week. Charles
Frohman's production of the Bisson
farce, "Off and On," is remarkable only
on account of the excellent actors em
ployed in it. Nut that the farce is bad.
It is ingeniously constructed, easily if
! not glitteringly phrased, and as pru
, dent as any piece can be that deals
i lightly with the weight? of matrimony.
â  But its motive Is slender and its active
â  situations few tÂ«i carry three acts. You
do not laugh hilariously until the mid-
die of the last act, when a furiously
funny situation is sprung. The rest is
leisurely amusement of the better
French mode, at which you smile often,
ha-ha once in a while and applaud
very moderately at the drops of the
' curtain. Played by a modest company,
say like the one at the Alcazar, "On
and Off" would be pillowed ii; the usual
brief and kindly press notices and play
to a week of usual business. Its recep-
tion at the Columbia is different be
cause there it Is Interpreted by picked
players of a different stamp, who give
to it the smooth, distinguished execu
tion that is next to impossible in the
week t<> week performances of a stock
company.
Many a day is it since we have had a
comic play served up in the polished
fashion that Mr. Frohman's players
â  serve this. The production is graceful,
(â .impact and secure. There was hut one
misfortune in last night's cast, and that
was In the mother-in-law part, which,
j in the illness of its original actress, was
taken at short notice by another.
Everything else seemed t<> run on ball
bearings, in the men's parts, especially,
the actors did even more than their
author had provided for them to do.
E. M. Holland and Fritz Williams, who
have the plums and honors, were im
peccable. Each of these men is an
artist of quiet poise and authority who
realizes the value of moderation and ;
suggestion. Pitted one against the!
other, as they were last night, in parts
of about equal strength, where the
word arid glance counted rather than
the deed, it was worth any ones while
to be "among those present" Fritz]
Williams has in his acting that quality
of alert ingenuous youth that most men
burn behind them as soon as they take
to the stage; and It found a happy vent
in the part of Alfred Godfray. the real
Bl( eping car inspector. Mr. Holland al
ways endeavors to present a definite
character. His George Godfray. the
spurious car inspector, is positive iden
tity from th.- top of his hat downâ
comic to a degreeâ never exploiting the
banal tricks of obvious playacting.
As the first deceived and then re
venged wife of the bogus railroad of
ti. lal, Essie Tittel did notably well.
H.-r acting is charmingly natural and
her pr.seive handsome and quite mag
netic. May Lambert's "winking girl"
i is a bit of St. Vitus' dance humor that
is very fetching in its arch-patholog
; ical way, and Ralph Detmore is briefly
to the good as her enterprising accom
plice. ASHTON STEVENS.
Alcazar.
A new play by Clay M. Greene. "His
Japanese Wife." received its initial pro
duction at the Alcazar last evening. Mr.
Greene, in a little explanatory programme
note, testifies to having gathered the ma
terial for the production while on a tour
of Japan and the experiences so deftly
ptrung together in :he fane had come
'â¢under his immediate observation." Ac
cepting the play as evidence. Mr. Greene's
oriental tour must have been one long
glorious Fourth of July.
The author has seen none of the poetry
Of Chrysanthemum Land. None of the
beauties thai writers so love to spread
themselves on has appealed to him. He
evidently traveled through the land of the
Mikado, extracting fun from everything
and with a triple extract of this Belfsame
merriment generously flavored his new
There is much that is new in the farce
â¢ui>'. much that is old, but what is new is
pood enough to obliterate the same Old
i hackneyed bad.
The story of His Japanese \\ Ife does
not bear repeating. It starts out plainly
and strongly, but before it is half through
is hopelessly involved and only the time
worn devices of tradition are called in to
see it safely through.
An affectionate mother-in-law, such as
no home should be Without, arid a Japa
nese wrestle? are too essential features
of the farce, and are treated in a manner
new and delightful to the stage.
The production went smoothly. Laura
Crews was a dainty Japanese maid and
Charles Bryant, barring a dialect that
was more Chinese than Japanese, carried
the wrestler for all the lines were worth.
Hastings. Montaine. Daniel Halifax,
Miss Fltzallen, Juliet Crosby, Marie Howe
and Grace Howard have congenial roles
and play them well.
The play is prettily staged and special
attention given to the music "Tho Japa
nese Serenade," by Lee Johnson, famous
as the author of many popular songs, is
one of the choice bits of entr'acte melody.
A large house greeted the performance
and the Bohemians were out in full force.
After the second act Mr. Greene was
called and in a neat speech thanked hjs
friends for their kind appreciation of his
work.
Grand Opera- House.
After an absence of about nine year?
"The Little Tycoon" was presented last
evening at the Grand Opera-house by the
Southwell Opera Company. It is the first
time this comic American-Japanese opera
has been produced in this city at popular
| prices, and the music-loving- public is not
; slow to take advantage of the oppor
: tunity to hear the charming music and
witness the pretty, changing scenes. The
i Japanese garden scene and the Jap
"ballet" were very attractive features.
Tin- singing of Miro Delamotta, William
Wolff. Thomas H. Persse and Miss Edith
Mason was highly appreciated. In the
tirst act little Mattie Southwell sang an
original coon song, "You Certainly Is
Hard Luck to Me." with much effect, and
her cake walk stops brought down the
house. "The Little Tycoon" promises to
do a good business. Next week the man
agement, contrary to Its previous an
nouncement, will produce the unique
double bill of "Cavalleria Rusticana" and
"Pinafore."
Orpheum.
I-:i Petite Lund, a very wee vaudeville
singer, is the hit of the new bill at the
Orpheum. Her coon song and cake walk
art- irresistible. John Le Clair does some
decidedly new feats in jugglery and Lazell
and Vernon do a comical and yet diffi
cult act on the horizontal bars. James
Richard Glenroy monologues and paro
dies: "The Hawthorne Sisters" have a
new song and a new scene, and Hugh
Stanton and Florence Modena present a
funny lit fie skit called "For Reform."
The rest of the bill is from last week.
Tivoli.
The ninety-third performance of "The
Geisha" was given in the Tivoli last night
tn ;â¢ good attendance. This is the last
week of the Japanese musical play.
"Orpheus and Eurydice" will be revived
Monday.
The Chutes
A combination of good weather and
good programme attracted a goodly
crowd to the Chutes last night. George
11. Wilson is a clever eccentric dancer,
Mabel <"raig has no voice, but a lively
pair of lower limbs which she shakes to
advantage, and the four Snlvinls. men
and women acrobats, are daring, agile,
. graceful and strong- The Hartwell sis
-1 ters are acrobatic dancers of no particu
: lar distinction, and Robert Bills, tenor
I robusto, sings some new descriptive songs
ii 1 a high spirited manner. The change in
moving pictures was well received.
â
Olympia.
The Olympia had a packed house last
night, and the drawing cards were Ed
Dolan, the funny Irish comedian with the
Johnny Ray voice, and Querita Vincent,
the singer of coon songs. Miss Vincent is
now In the last week of her engagement
at the Olympia, having broken the record
with a run of fifteen consecutive we. ks.
an>! she leaves a greater favorite than,
when she started in.
Maud Adams in New York.
NEW YORK. May B.â Maud Adams
made her debut to-night in Shakes
pearian drama, essaying Juliet to Wil
liam Faversham's Rome., at the Empire
Theater. The interpretation of the role 1
by this popular young actress was en
tirely different from other Juliets. She
relied absolutely upon perfect girlish
simplicity with Just a drtsh of coquetry.
There was scarcely anything of the
grand passion in her acting. She was the
15-year-old girl from beginning to end,
truer, perhaps, to the real Juliet than the,
popular conception of that immortal
character. Judging from the frequent
ovations .-!:â  received from tho audience,
her debut was eminently successful.
London Opera Opening.
LONPON, May B.â The opera sea
son at Covent Garden opened to-night
with "Lohengrin." The Prince of Wales
was one of the interested spectators. Mrs
Mackay, who arrived to-day from Paris,
was in her own box with her sister, Coun
tess Tel fen er.

THE BICYCLE NUISANCE.
RFXENTLY the police have done some good
work in the enforcement of the law and have
won general commendation for their energy and
for their success. We hope now to attract their atten
tion to the bicycle nuisance, which, unless some ex
amples are made, threatens life and limb on our public
streets and in places of general resort.
Order No. 2932, approved November 26, 1895, to a
great extent covers this subject. We are not aware of ,
any amendments or supplements to this order, which
upon its face so far as it goes seems to be sufficient for
its purposes. The first section prohibits carelessness or |
immoderate speed and limits the maximum speed over
street crossings and intersections to six miles per
hour. It further provides that a warning bell should
be sounded at all such places and wherever pÂ»
trians are encountered. The next section reqv.
every rider of a bicycle on a public street or highway
to keep his feet on the pedals, thus making scorching
or coasting on thoroughfares a misdemeanor. The
third section denies the right of bicycles to the side
walks, and the fourth condemns the practice of carry
ing upon them children under the age of 10 years.
The fifth section directs all bicycles to keep to the
right. The two last sections are the most important,
because one of them for a violation of any of the pro
visions of the order affixes the penalty of a fine not
exceeding $500 or of imprisonment in the County
Jail for a period not beyond six months, either or
both, and the other specifically charges the Chief of j
Police with the duty of enforcing the order.
There is not one of these essential municipal regu
lations that is not violated day by day and night by
night in full view of the police on the streets and in
the parks of San Francisco. The modern centaurs
;ire more reckless and more dangerous than their
antetypes. Many of them seem to imagine that they
constitute a kind of aristocracy, with machinery sub
stituted for their legs, and that they can run down any
unfortunate man, woman or child with impunity.
Many serious consequences of this recklessness have
already been observed, and the bicycle accidents are
constantly increasing, simply because, in this respect
as in a great many others, the law is not enforced. A
few wholesome examples would be a service to the
community.
The business of manufacturing and selling bicycles
has become very extensive in the United States, and
several corporations and houses with large capital
which control this branch of trade are reaping large
profits and exerting an illegitimate influence in munic
ipalities, not only in preventing the enactment of
proper laws but in obstructine the administration of
such law as there is. In San Francisco, as we under
stand the fact, there was an effort made by a resolu
tion offered in the Board of Supervisors to compel all
riders of bicycles at night to carry warning lamps, but
under pressure it was defeated or failed to pass. This
is an illustration of the difficulty of securing just mv-
nicipal legislation. The virtual suspension of the ex
isting order proves that either through inertness or
for some other cause such law as there is has not been
effectively applied.
We call upon the Chief of Police to do hi- daty as
it is expressed in section 6, and upon the Board of
Supervisors to require the u c e of lamps by the noc
turnal army of centr.urs. and to make such other
amendments and additions to the order as will practi
cally secure the public safety and prove that in this
municipality human beings are of as much importance
a? the trade in mechanical 1 contrivances.
The report that an early cessation of the war in the
Philippines will be followed by a call for an extra
session of Congress is calculated to put the people of
this country in a wavering state of mind. There are
moments when most persons would prefer a contin
uance of the war.
If any further proof of the prosperity of the country
were needed than is supplied by the trade reports it
could be found in the number of strike? that are now
raging. The workman in nearly every line of industry
seems to have waxed fat enough to kick, and is do
ing it.
If the Czar of Russia intends to continue to enforce
his law sentencing lepers to exile he had better buy
I somewhere to send them to. or Uncle Sam
might retaliate some day by sending anarchists into

' re is hardly anything in the findings of the court |
of inquiry concerning the army supplies that is likely
to be in good odor with the people. The report itself
is suggestive of something that has been embalmed j
when it should have been buried.

cheerful assurance tliat the peaoe conference at The
Hague will do a world of gocxl, not one of them Jias

DOGBERRY OUTCLASSED.
ON March 6, 1899. in response to a general pub
lic demand which had been argumentatively
and illustratively enforced in the columns of
The Call. Supervisor Perrault submitted to the Board
j of Supervisors an order to prohibit poolselling. book
' making and betting on races within this municipality.
The order, numbered 174. was passed for printing,
and on March 13, 1899, it was adopted by the board
land signed by the Mayor. All the proceedings cor
responded with the steady practice under the careful
supervision of Clerk Ru?sell for twenty years. Simi
lar orders have stood even- test that the ingenuity or
i the learning of the bar could invent or suggest.
For a violation of this order H. L. Jones was ar
j rested. He demanded a jury trial. A disagreement
i occurred before Police Judge Mogan. The second
trial was completed yesterday in Judge Treadwell's
department of the Police Court, but owing to his sick
ness b.efore Justice of the Peace Groezinger. Henry
Ach, counsel for the defendants in this and in a num
ber of similar cases pending in the same tribunal, at
j tacked the order upon the ground that the minutes
I of the Board of Supervisors, in which the proceedings
' from its introduction up to and including its passage
were recorded, were defective in four particulars:
First, because they did not show the regularity of the
i meetings; second, because they did not disclose the
presence or the absence of a quorum; third, because
' the ayes and noes were not fully inscribed, and, fourth,
: because the fact of publication was not explicitly
> stated.
After refusing to allow Prosecuting Attorney Car
i penter time to prepare an answer to the argument and
' the citations of Mr. Ach, Justice of the Peace Groez
] inger directed the jury to acquit, on the astonishing
I ground that the informalities alleged for the defense
rendered the order unconstitutional. His exact lan
guage ought to be preserved:
"I am satisfied that the order was unconstitutional,
as it was not properly passed. The minutes have
been mutilated since the defendant's arrest, and I
shall instruct the jury to retire and bring in a verdict
of acquittal."
The mutilation referred to consisted of some addi
tions to the records, in no way affecting its original
j sufficiency, which were made by Clerk Russell to meet
flimsy and technical objections presented by Mr. Ach
! in the argument of the civil suit for an injunction
I before Judge Murasky. in which, as we understand the
facts, the decision was exactly the reverse of yester
day's ruling.
The efficiency and the detailed exactitude of Mr.
Russell have been household words in San Francisco
for a quarter of a century. If order 174 was void, then
the presumption is that our municipal legislation for
that period is also "unconstitutional." But the touts,
the gamblers, the combined parasites of the racetrack
who have sucked the blood of the community and
generated crime, immorality and ruin to an unbear
able degree can derive no encouragement from this
absurd decision. It pn*sesse< no authority and it will
inspire both popular and professional contempt.
In the enactment of order 174 every requirement of
the Consolidation Act. its amendments and its sup
plement?, was fully met Even though its recorded
history was defective, which it was not, its regularity
would have hcen presumed by any competent judicial
officer. Section kjiX. subdivision 5. section 1920 and
section 1963, subdivision 15, of the Code of Civil Pro
cedure, which deal with the subject, were applied and
interpreted in the case of the County of San Diego vs.
Siefert. reported in volume 07 of the California Re
ports, at page 599. which involves an analogous ques
tion. This is only one authority. But there are many
and later pertinent cases which it is not within the
province of a new-paper to collate. We will venture
to predict that by any court which is competent to de
clare the law the charge of Justice of the Peace Groez
inger would be regarded as a compound of the gro
tesque absurdity and puerile dogmatism of the Bunsby
tribunal and Mr. Justice Dogberry.
The power of the Roard of Supervisors to prohibit
the illegitimate practices at [ngleside and in the pool
r'M.ms cannot be successfully questioned. If the prcs
order were void it could be readily and it would
promptly re enacted. The crusade for decency will
proceed with unabated vigor in spite of the wholesale
:isÂ«ni< that Judge Groezinger contemplates to-
S da}', and it will certainly suc< eed.
THE BEEF INQUIRY FINDINGS.
WHILE the great majority of patriotic Ameri
cans would be glad to be able to accept the re
port of the beef inquiry court as final on the
subject, comparatively few of them will do so. Even
iio have not closely followed the testimony in
the case will find in the report itself sufficient cause for
dissatisfaction with its conclusions.
The court finds that none of the charges made
against the beef furnished by the packers were sus
tained, and says: ''The meat purchased for the army
was the meat of commerce; both kinds â refrigerated
and canned â were such as are well known in both
hemispheres as commercial articles, of which there is
and has been a very large consumption, not only by
the trade generally but by the United States navy and
by the armies ami navies of Europe. No reports of
the unfitness or unsuitability of the beef sent from the
United States were forwarded to the War Department
by any general or officer serving in Cuba or Porto
Rico while operations were in progress, nor were any
such reports received until more than a month after
hostilities had passed. Barring some defects of meth
ods in inspecting the beef and the delivery to the sub
sistence department, the deterioration of the meat in
shipment was due to the fault of no one."
From that passage in the report it would seem the
commission had no fault to find with any one except
General Miles, who made the charge?, and the officers
who sustained him. Nevertheless it is said in another
passage, "in some instances some individuals failed to
perform the full measure of duty," and it is added:
"The court can but characterize the action of the com
missary general as unwarranted and reckless in that
he ordered the purchase of such enormous quantities
of a food that was practically untried and unknown,
and the court so finds."
Thus in the selfsame report we have the contra
dictory finding?; first, that the meat was of a kind
having a large consumption, not only by the trade
generally but by the United States navy and by the
armies and navies of Europe, and, second, that the
food was of a kind practically untried and unknown.
There may be some way of reconciling the two find
ings, but it look? on the face as if the first were made
in order to lay a foundation for censuring Miles and
the second for the purpose of justifying the censure of
Eagan.
The only parties involved in the scandal who are
completely exonerated by the report are the beef con
tractors, as it is said of them not only that their beef
was put up without any kind of chemical preservatives
at all. but that "the large purchases for the use of the
military forces were made- not at the solicitation of the
rs or in consequence of efforts put forth by them
to sell their good*, but upon the initiative of the com
missary general."
Finally the court makes something like a genera]
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MAY 9, 1899.
whitewash. It finds "that against none of the officers
commanding corps, divisions, brigades and regiments
and their staff officers should a charge of guilty be
brought." It finds, notwithstanding his "unwarranted
and reckless" purchase of beef, "no ground for impu
tation of any other actuating motive on the part of
the commissary general than an earnest desire to pro
cure the best possible food for the troops." Thus the
only man remaining under the ban is General Miles,
and even in his case it is recommended that "further
proceedings be not taken."
Such a report will not be satisfactory to any con
siderable class of the American people. It closes the
inquiry from an official point of view, but it docs not
; relieve the War Department from the charges of
Miles, nor will it lead public opinion to regard Gen-
I eral Miles as deserving of the censure put upon him.
GENERAL MERRIOM ON UNIONS.
THE acts of lawlessness in the Coeur d'Alcne
mines are about to be vigorously and properly
punished. They have long been indulged in
under cover of a miners' union, which seems to have
been controlled by a few violent and law-defying men.
The civil authorities have either closed their eyes to
the situation or have winked at it without making any
attempt to protect the lawful rights of persons and
property. The district being now under martial law
and the violent and guilty men being in custody, the
whole country will applaud the Federal and State
â¢luthorities, civil and military, in their determination
to eradicate the law-breaking element and teach it a
lesson which will admonish any who attempt to imi
tate its policy.
The situation there, however, has seemed to inspire
General Merriam to utter an unjustifiable generaliza
tion. He is quoted as denouncing labor unions as
criminal and declaring that they should be forbidden
bj* law and membership in them be made a statutory
1 crime.
This outline of a policy toward labor unions will
not receive the indorsement of the American people
and will rouse opposition to certain general public
, policies recently originated and still under discussion.
The labor unions which have originated violence and
defiance of the law are few in number compared to
the total list of such unions in this country. The courts
\ are gradually defining the rights of labor combina
tions, and are removing by judicial decision the invol
untary element in their policy. The right of work
men in any line of labor to form a voluntary union,
. protect a scale of wages for its members, provide a
: treasury and pay sick and funeral benefits, co-operate
in the purchase of domestic supplies and in all orderly
'â¢ ways promote by organization the interests of indi
vidual members is indisputable, and its exercise may
be salutary. When a union exercises further powers
and claims the right to prevent the employment of
any man who will not join it it is claiming a right
which it can enforce only by unlawful acts.
Because these unlawful acts may issue from a labor
; union is no reason for denouncing the act and fact of
union as a crime.
General Merriam's proposition is another added to
many recent evidences that the country should not
look to professional soldiers for a civil policy. All
; governments, in the last analysis, rest on force, but
! the need for its exercise is lessened in proportion as
the people are left free.
To assume, of? hand, that all labor union? are crim
inal would at once produce a disturbance which would
disorder the industries of the country and probably
cause a protest in such form as would greatly embar
i rass the Government. The principle of the policy rec
ommended by Merriam would be far reaching. There
â  is scarcely an organization or union of men combined
upon any purpose that may not fall under his sweep
ing declaration. Political parties are organizations,
' combinations and unions of men which are recognized
â  by law, and in their operation arise cases that are
! judicable. That parties commit crimes in precisely
! the same sense in which labor unions commit them
is unquestioned. The officers elected to administer
[ government peculate and destroy the public property
and therein offend against the whole body of the peo
ple. Because a Democratic School Board and a Re
publican Treasurer in San Francisco and a Populist
deputy clerk in Sacramento or a Treasurer of the
same party elsewhere were guilty of embezzlement or
waste, therefore shall the combination of men in
! political parties be denounced by the law and for
: bidden as a crime?
What is needed in Idaho and elsewhere is a rigid
enforcement of the civil law and the prompt punish
ment of those who break it. If it is in the power of the
State authorities in Idaho to enforce the law now, it
has always been in their power to do so. When the
miners committed murder with Springfield rifles
which they had stolen from a State armory they were
guilty of two offenses of the highest order, and the
State had ample power to punish them. The immu
nity they enjoyed by reason of this inaction of the
officers of the law encouraged the greater crimes com
mitted since. The icmedy is not in adding to the list
of statutory crimes, but in punishing the commission
of those offenses already defined by the law.
The opponents of Bryan in the Democratic camp
who are now trying to substitute an anti-trust plank â 
j in place of the money plank as the chief issue in the j
campaign next year may possibly succeed, but the I
' chances are against them. In every test of strength \
' he has made with his opponents in camp so far the j
; colonel has emerged with something like a sixteen to I
; one majority.
It is now reported the fruit crop will not equal the
bright expectations caused by the bountiful rains of
March. The fruit is dropping badly, and the only
consolation is in the hope that prices will rise as the
fruit falls.
To the increasing list of dignitaries who talk too
much we shall have to add the name of General Mer
riam. In fact it seems that the taciturn class of men
has left official position and gone into private life.
The person who started the report that Aguin
aldo is the son of an Irishman should have been
questioned further. Possibly the brat was at one
time called Dennis for short.
Edward Atkinson may be set down as another man
who talks too much, even though he thinks right.
Choate. Jordan, Coghlan, Kautz, Atkinson and Mrs.
Fryeâ it is an illustrious list.
"The Wrong Mr. Wright" is the title of a play pro
duced at the Macdonough in Oakland last night "'for
the first time." Oaklanders declare that the play seems
to be an old one to them.
The latest suggestion for a Democratic ticket in
1900 is Bryan and Belmont, and the initials would be
a very good warning of the bad business that would |
follow their election.

A SOLDIER EXPRESSES GRATITUDE.
Editor The Callâ Appreciating as I <3o favors received, I send you this as an
acknowledgment of the same. I notice other journals of your city attempting
to take unto themselves all the glory of favoring our bluejackets stationed at
Manila and would like to make a statement relating to what I know of the man
ner in which we received our news from home, outside of our personal corre
spondence. I was a member of the crew of the U. S. S. Baltimore and although
we saw copies of "all papers," which had been sent privately to friends by rela
tives of friends (and all paper? were one month old), the only San Francisco or
other city paper published in the United States which came in numbers to J us |' fv
a general distribution of the same was the San Francisco Call. We entered Ma
nila harbor on May 1. 1898, and I was there- until February 17 following. At one
time the boys aboard cur vessel contemplated sending you an acknowledgment
of your favor to us, and many cheers were given for The Call, but owing, in all
probability, to a call to other duties we had neglected to do so.
However, would kindly state that <>ne only has to experience a visit to a for
eign country under same conditions to appreciate the receipt of news from
home, and through the courtesy of The Call we had papers in bundles of suffi
cient numbers to insure a general distribution among the boys. The Call was re
ceived in bundles on our ship of 200 or 300.
I can thank you sincerely in behalf of the Baltimore crew and myself per
sonally for your" favor. W. E. ANGLIN, 525 Broadway, Oakland, Cal.
PURTELLE LOST
ALL CONFIDENCE
IN HIS WIFE

Her Sleep.
Â«
TESTIFIES AGAINST WRIGHT
HIS DEPOSITION TAKEN BY THE
DEFENSE.
Plaintiff in the Damage Suit Against
a Larkspur Capitalist Tells
How His Suspicions
Were Aroused.
TV. H. Purtelle. who la suing C. W.
Wright, a Larkspur capitalist, for $2n.<V'rt
damages for alleged wrongful attempts to
injure htm and deprive him of the com
fort and society of his wife, made a dep
osition last week in this city under an
order of the Superior Court of Marin
County, made nt the request of the de
fendant. He w;;s represented by C. F.
Humphrey nnd T,ouis p. Boardman, the
Interests of the defendant being cared for
hy E. C. Chapman and Hepburn Wilktus.
The quarrel with his wife regarding the
actions of Wright set forth In the com
plaint, the witness testified, occurred
about January IS lnst, when Mrs. Pur
telle came to tills city. Leading up to
this separation, the witness sidd, there
was a lack of confidence on his part In
his wife, due to several things, among
others a conversation he had with the i
wife of the defendant, In which she told
him of n little scene her daughter had
witnessed in the woods. "She asked her
papa afterward," testified Purtelle,
"what he and Mrs. Purtelle were doing.
He snld he was helping her to carry wood,
but she thought he was trying to carry
Mrs. Purtelle."
Later nn Purtelle testified he was going
up to the hills tn get some wood and his
wife told him to go to a place where she
hnd been.
"I did so," he went on, "and picked up a
handkerchief. It had C. W. Wright's in
itials on It. I brought it up- and gave It
to her."
At another time, Purtelle said, he was
surprised while at Wright's house to hear
the capitalist tell Mrs. Purtelle "shut up."
"She shut up," continued the wltn< ss,
"in such a way, and I thought it was
Buch strong language for him to use to
my wife or any lady, but she didn't seem
to resent it."
At a primary election following tills in
cident Purtelle testified that he waa ap
proached by a friend of his. Jim Culligan,
who said. "You ought to hear what peo
ple are saying about Wright and your
wife."
About dusk on thÂ«> 18th of January last
Purtell* testified he saw Wrighi and Mrs.
Purtelle standing under a tree on the hill.
He then wem Into his house and on his
wife's return hud a quarrel with her. He
went outside to cool off and when he re
turn, -d his wife was pone.
"1 thought." he testified, "that she
might have committed suicide. 1 went
down t" the well and called her and then
went over to Wright's. Mrs. Wright came
to the door. I asked her if Mrs. Purtelle
had been over there and she said 'no.'
she had nit seen her. 1 said "she went
out' and that 1 did not know where she
had gone to. She said. 'Wait, I will see
Mr. Wright.' Mr. Wright came in with a
sneaking, dogged look upon him. He said
Mrs. Purtelle had been there and they
were talking and she had gone home. I
went over home then. My wife was thÂ»T
and I told her if she was groins: to take
counsel with Mr. Wright she had hotter
go over there."
Purtelle said that his suspicions had
been very actively aroused prior to this
by some remarks he had heard his wife
drop in her Bleep, but she did not make a
confession of her actions until after I'm
telle and the detective he had placed on
Wright's trail caught th mple in a
room in the Tremorit House on Kearny
street, the donr of which they had broken
in. On that occasion. WriKht testified, as
he was leaving- the couple in the room in
the lodging house. Wright "kind of"
winked at nim and said: "Purtelle it's
all right. I-efs talk it over. I'll settle
this."
The remainder of Purtelle's testimony
was to the effect that his wife, in con
fessing to him, said that she had sub
mitted to Wright, whom she disliked,
through fear.
Wright has ten days in which to file
his answer to the complaint filed by Pur-
USUe.

KYTKA SWEARS
THAT McGLADE
IS A FORGER
Expert Appears for
Prosecution.
TEN DOCUMENTS IN EVIDENCE
OBJECTIONS OF DEFENSE ARE
WITHOUT AVAIL.
When the Cross-Examination Came,
However, the Witness Did Not
Enjoy Himself, Nor
Will He To-Day.
Theodore Kytka, the handwriting ex
pert, has shaken the dust of Willows
from his feet after giving the celebrated
Murdock note several telling stabs, and
yesterday he joined the men engaged in
the occupation of trying to send Peter
McGlade, late of the Rtre.-t Department,
to prison. Kytka was put on the stand
early In the morning and occupied that
position until the close of tbe session. On
taking the stand the writing expert was
handed the document upon which the spe
cific charge <>f forgery is based and was
asked by the prosecution to give his opin
ion as to who signed the receipt on the
ba.k of the document and who filled out
the various oth> r signatures. Attorney
Patrick Reddy objected on the ground
that the document was not a legal one
and not relevant.
The objection was overruled and Kytka
paid he was confident that the various
signatures wf-re In McGlade'a handwrit
ing. In order additional warrants alleged
to have been forged by McGlade were in
troduced over the objection of the de
fendant and Kytka gave his opinion that
all were forced by the accused. Then
rame the cross-examination and it was
an unhappy one for Kytka. Kytka's love
of justice did not bring him Into the case,
as is well known, and the fact of the
compensation he was to receive, the many
cases in which he had appeared and his
opinions found erroneous were brought up
and Kytka Buffered. Finally the storm
broke when Mr. Reddy ask..] the expert
how many "tremors" in handwriting his
profession recognized. K\tka promptly
answered the tremor of imbecility, of age
n ml of fraud. He was asked to distin
guish between the tr. nv>r of fraud and in
ebriation and before he could be Btopped
said, "In the $<v? warrant wf have a per
fect example of the tremor of fraud."
Then Mr. Reddy started for the expert on
the effects of a "hold-over jag," common
drunkenness and champagne imbibing,
when the prosecution objected. After en
joying a laugh at Kytka's expense the de
fense turned Its attention to other cases
in which Kytka had appeared and it de
veloped that in a well-known will contest
$100,000 had t.een spilled around among the
"experts" and Kytka smilingly acknowl
edged that he was "In on the spill."
Then the defense asked for certain doc
uments in the possession of the expert to
prove how many times he had been found
mistaken in his views. As Kytka did not
have them in court an adjournment was
taken till this morning, at which time the
expert will try and redeem himself from
the imputation that he Is more often
wrong than right in his opinions of docu
mentary signatures.

Some Missing Checks
Discovered.
LAY FORGOTTEN IN A VAULT
MISTAKE OF A MESSENGER IS
FINALLY RECTIFIED.
Accused Should Have Placed tha
Paper in a Bank Instead of in
a Safe Deposit Lock
Sox.
Thp Neall msr t'.<->k an unexpected turn
yesterday morning. New evldi
kind most Important to the a< â 
been found and the court gave Mr. T f
ton until this morning to properly pro
pare it for pri tually
disposes of the charge relating to the
overdraft of $150, which it was alleged
showed upon the books of the Calif
Safe Deposil and Trust Company, where
Neall kept the funds of the exchange.
The new evidence was the sudden dis
covery of checks to the value of $426.
which had been placed in the vault of
the Safe Deposit Company instead of in
tho bank of that institution.
It seems that between January 27 and
January 30 of this year Xeall calli
Dunne's snln<>n at Stockton and
streets and asked Pete Dunne to I
charge of some papers for him. 11
after banking hours, Neall explained, and
he wanted Dunne to look out for th
pers for that evening and in the morn
ing following to have them taken i
to the Safe Deposit Company and
there. The company would know
.to do with them, Neall said. It w
save him an extra trip from the P
sldio, he told Dunne, and Dunne ;
ised to look out for the envelope â¢>â¢â 
Neall handed him.
The next morning Dunne sent the en
velope down t" the Sat".' Deposit f
of his bartenders, and instead of lea
the papers with tin- banking d<-}>ar
the messenger took them downstairs an>:
left them in storage in the deposit \
He returned thÂ«- receipt to Dunne, wl
left It in the rack for Neall for some days
and then it was dropped into a drawer.
Tt was raked out with a lot of papers
last Saturday and Dunne at once sent it
to Neall. He notified Thornton and Thorrt
ton secured the papers from the d< | -%
company and found N'eall just J4L>>; ahead,
fur he had air. ady made g lto th<
eminent all the checks re]
Neall had all along maintained that he
had never overdrawn the account of the
exchange with the Safe Deposit Com
pany. Even In the face of the figures
sHowed him he was unwilling to admit it.
and all the time he believed th.' checks
just found were included in the
ment made by the bank in reporting on
the state of the exchange account. H â¢â 
had missed th<- checks and could find
them nowhere, nor could he find the
book which he had placed with th<
the envelope, and the sudden discovery
has cleared up what was to him a mys
tery.
The charge was that Neall had over
drawn the exchange account to the
amount of $i:.f>. This amount he made
frood and now by the tinding of the checks
t appears the account really owed him
$278.
All this was explained by Mr. Thornton
yesterday morning when asking tbe court
for time to present the evidence of this
discovery. It has no bearing 6n the other
charges and specifications, but It lightens
the load on .Wall's shoulders and makrs
more forcible the denials which h<
submitted to the court on other charges.

PROVED TO BE
HIS NEMESIS
Rev. Dr. Lowell Says
He Is Persecuted.
WANTS HIS ENEMY ARRESTED
A SHARP CRITICISM ON REV.
W. S. MATTHEW.
â¦
An Interesting and Spicy Account of
How a Young Preacher An
tagonized One of His
Congregation.
Rev,
Curtis with erlm
Behind the Police Court proceedings is
an Interesting allegation of how one man
out of revenge has persecuted another;
how the desire of a deacon of the church
to inflict further humiliation on his vic
tim has led him to follow a minister of
the gospel from Maine to California, so
that he could wreak his spite on the man
he detests.
The above condition of things was made
public yesterday afternoon, when the
Rev. Walter Myron Lowell appeared be
fore a half score of the leading Methodist
Epicop.il preachers of this city, and there
poured out his tale of persecution and
suffering. The meeting was held in the
lecture room of the Central M. E. Church,
and was presided over by Dr. Case, the
presiding elder of San Francisco:
Iti a straightforward manner Mi Lowell
pave a detailed account of his life and
the Incidents that led up to his coming In
contact Deacon Curtis of the Bap
tist church and the reasons why the
: itter has done his utmost to injure him.
The young minister backed up his state
ments with documents and newspaper
clippings, and In the end virtually suc
ceeded In convincing his listeners of his
entire innocence. He referred a number
of times to the part Rev. Dr. William S.
Matthews of the Christian Advocate
played In the affair, and as a result the
latter was sent for and â  Id what he had
learned and hat hi had done in the
matter. As the meeting was not In the
nature of a trial, no decision was reached,
but the confidence the ministers had In
Mr. Lowell's story was shown when the
Investigation came to an end. The meet
ing was a â  secret one, and none of those
who were present cared to discuss the
mutter.
At the outlet he accused his enemy as :
being a fraudulent) untruthful man, and
backed his assertion ui> by quoting a de- j
cision of the Supreme Court of Maine in :
the casi 1 of Freeman vs. Curtis, ','. Maine.
"A few years ago." ho said, "Curtis was j
a member of my church and owned i
twenty-seven pews. He was so moan and '
small that he would not permit any one i
to occupy the pew.-? without their first
paying him for their use. and then he ;
would pocket the money. I then sue- (
ceeded in raising a large sum and had the i
edifice remodeled, and my action made
him my bitterest enemy.- He swore to fol
low me to the ends of the earth nnd in
jure me. He came here and went to Dr. J
Matthews nnd told him things that were
true and more that were false. On learn
ing of his malicious conduct I swore to
a warrant for his arrest, hut he got wind
of it and led. If it is ever served on him j
and he is brought to this city, my altor
neys. Messrs. Custer & Bates, are In- >
structed to file .i suit against him for
libel for $.">O,OOO damages.
While actlnp as pastor he ran afoul

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Strut- of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna end
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to gel its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company

TALK FOR THEiR KIND.
Theosophists, Led by Mrs. Ting
ley, Speak of Universal
Brotherhood.
The Universal Brotherhood, Interna
tional Council of Theoaophista in America,
held a public meeting lust nigM< In Metro
politan Temple, ; 1 1 which addresses were
delivered by (Catherine A. Tlngley, leader
and official hcaii of the league. Several
of hr cabinet officers and representatives
in the recent congress of theosophlsts at
Point Loma, CaL, also spoke on various
subjects.
The purposes of the organization were
explained and the principles taught by it
were discussed at great length by the
speakers. The main topic which 'engaged
their attention was the "Philosophy of
.Life," by which a nobler manhood may be
attained.
There was music by the noted London
Wagrnerian interpreters, Mrs. Alice i..
Cleather and Basil Crump. A large audi
ence gathered ;it the Temple and testified
their appreciation bj frequent applause.
Henry Turner Patterson, treasurer of
the Arlon Thcosophlcal Society of New
York, acted as chairman and introduced
the tirst speaker of the evening, B. A.
Nereshelmer, president of the cabinet of
the Universal Brotherhood. His subject
was "The Philosophj of Life and How It
Came Lnto Existence."
"Universal Brotherhood," he said, "i.s
spiritualism, occultism or, In fact,
any 01 the 'isms.' 11 Â»;ts organized for
the people of the earth and taught the
highest philosophy the philosophy of life,
which is in ai| books, in all religioua
Scriptures, l>iu essentially In the human
heart and soul. The proof of the strength
of the soul lies in the fact ili.it aa people
grow older the mind grows chore self-as
sertive. .Man is the apex uf. evolution.
Hi- is an Intellectual iÂ«'inn am) not a
Jumble or a cnaos. The philosophy of
Uf, came Into existence by a natural reali
zation "i those Belf-evldent truths.
Mrs. Tingley next addressed the ass. m
iii;iK r <- and s.nd in the course "t" her re
mai ks:
"Universal brotherhood is the might}
tori â¢ of the nineteenth centurj wnich
moves and touches the minds ol men ami
will carrj It Into the next century. One
great thing that we teach is the 'heart
doctrini which Is all that can be really
ded on. Humanity has taught too
much of the letter and too little of tlu
spirit of things. There arc different doc
trines, all claiming to be the key note to
the real life, imi the 'heat-: doctrine' more
nearlj approaches the ideal. Wherever
the heart rules spirituality is, for the
heart is the Beat of the soul.
"There are people who live In their
mentality si* much, and In their soul so
little that they are continually demand
ing proofs The Universal Brotherhood
[8 endeavoring to bring forward the
proofs of what ii believes in.
"My experience In prisons and slums is
that 11 takes almost all eternity to change
a man's life by reasoning with him, or
seeking to convince him on a faith basis.
The Brotherhood, In Its endeavor to up
lift humanity, tries to touch the man's
heart and by appealing to something thai
moves the heart. This method has m>-t
with enormous success. Man should be
taught to energi2e his body and soul with
spiritual thoughts, for then blsrotry, In
tolerance and the spirit of persecution will
be a thing of the past and we will have
a mighty humanity.
"Let the lives of the little ones be
molded bo thai they win be better citizens
than you or I. Let us cultivate a higher
spirit 'of patriotism, a higher spirituality
and a greater spirit of brotherly love."
Mr Fverson L. Harris of Macon, <;a.,
superintendent of the International
Brotherhood Colony at Point Loma, was
the next speaker and was followed by
Dr. Jerome A. Anderson, who argued that
we flo not have a ri^ht philosophy of
life.
"We have become one-sided in our de
velopment," said he. "We of the Wesl
have cultivated the intellect at the ex
pense of the heart. That is why the Uni
versal Brotherhood lays so much stress
on the â¢heart doctrine.' A man may have
all the sciences at his liiiKor tips and yet
be a moral monster. The child is not
taught to develop its soul in the direction
oi belplng his fellow creatures, as it
should be. tlold. greed, power and self
ishness are our main ideas winch come
not from the heart, but are intellect born.
Let vis learn to develop the heart side of
our nature.
'â¢The philosophy of life hrinÃs to the
world a message Of peace and love. The
day will soon dawn when men will recog
nlae one divinity, that humanity are all
brotht â 
Short addresses were also made by
dark Thurston, I >r. Allen Griffith, presi
dent of San Francisco Lodge, and Mrs.
Alice L. Cleather, who spoke on the "Per
t". .-ability of Man."

ing will be continued this evening vi the

The Hoard of Education and Auditor
wvils ;irv having a heap of trouble over
the payment of the bills of certain con
tractors who supplied the heating and
ventilating plant of the new Mission Ili^h
School. The IV' k-Williamson Ventilating
Company was awarded the contract to
equip the new hl^h school with proper
ventilating and heating facilities, but it
seems that after the work was completed
Architects Havens and Topke refuse. l to
pass the job for the reason that it was
[ "wholly unsatisfactory." The company's
agent, Charles Besort, is said to be re
sponsible for the quality of the work ami
there Is a score of local sub-contractors
who cannot get their money who shy at
the mention of Besort's name. The ven

with several local tradesmen, such a.;
metal roofers, plumbers, painters, etc.,
for thi> performance of such work on the
ventilating and heating plant being
placed In the school as came within their
special line.
When the plant was finally installed in
the building Besort called the attention
of the architects to the work and they
went through the usual formality of test
ing the plant. The heaters failed to heat
the rooms to the stipulated temperature.
the ventilators did not work properly, and
in short. Architect- Havens and Topke
flatly refused to situ Besort's demand for
the final payment unless he placed the
plant In propi r working order and finish
ed it In compliance with the plans and
specifications.
This placed the sub-contractors in an
unfortunate position, as they have 1 n
unable to get tin ir money. The company
has not as yet evinced any desire to set
tle with the sub-contractors and a merry
row is in progress.
The sub-contractors, all of whom are
reputable business men. have served both
the Board of Education and the Auditor

ation and requesting them not to pay
Peck Williamson i<r Co. a cent until their

most succeeded In overturning the vehi
cle and throwing out tin cupants.
The horse first t"<'k the bil in his teeth
at Stanyan street and was running away
beyond the cent ml of Mrs. Ellsworth,
when Kavanagh saw it and went in chase.
[He overtook the run Lway at Ashbury
Street and after quieting the animal down
and tiKhtenhiK the Check he allowed Mrs.
Ellsworth to proceed on her belief that
she could hold the horse. Half a block
farther on the second runaway started
and in Mrs. Ellsworth's attempts to stop
the horse he ran up on one of the bor
ders of the panhandle, tilting the vehicle
dangerously and breaking several spokes
from one of the wheels. Kavanagh
reached the scene in time to save more
serious accident.

PEACHES WILL BE SCARCE
NOT MORE THAN HALF A CROP EXPECT-
PPLE PROSPECTS AUK BRIGHT.
The New York Commercial says; "The sea- |
foii is far enough advanced to make predic
tions regarding the peach crop reasonably cor
rect. Recent reports corroborate the state- i
ments previously published, to the effect that
throughout the Southern peach belt the crop
Is a virtual failure. Georgia shipped over 2000
cars last year. This year not a car will leave
that State. In some sections of Maryland the
ruin Is complete. In others there will be a
email crop.
"Delaware will produce considerably less
than last year. The yield In that State has j
declined from 9,000.000 baskets, a few years ago,
to 1,000,000 last year, and probably not half
that quantity this year.
"In the northern tier of States the outlook
Is lens gloomy. Michigan was injured some
what, but not so seriously us was expected.
Illinois will have a fair yield, and the fame is
true of Ohio. Western New York will yield
about as freely as ever California will have
a bumper crop, and there" will unquestionably
be liberal crops In Washington and Oregon.
Summing up all available Information, it ap
pears that the crop will â¢â - about one-half what I
It would have been without the severe Febru
ary freeze.
"It Is too early to Bay much about apples.
The eleven great producing States appear like- j
ly to have, a fair crop. The trees are in full
bloom along the Southern producing range, but
not until the blossom fails can the size of the
pet be definitely determined. Growers predict
a fair >;.;â !. Through the States of Ohio and
Indiana and some parts of Illinois, growers
say the yield will be heavier than the average.
New York promises well, so far as can be de
termini now. Pennsylvania will probably )
yield as many as the average. The Pacific
Coast expects a large crop."
NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
Mail advices from New York say of that dried
fruit market: "Prunes are firm. Supplies are |
small for the season, both here and on the I
coast, and while trade Is quiet. It is believed ;
by holders that it will be sufficient to clean
up everything obtainable before the new crop |
comes In. Added to that Is the influence of
the drop, which is reported larger than antici- ]
pated No news has been received so far as '
reported from Oregon and Washington, which
leads to the conclusion that the crop is prob
ably in fair condition.
"Nothing new is reported in raisins. There
Is a fair consuming demand for most grades !
of California loose muscatels, and prices ap- |
pÂ«ar to be tending upward. It would be dlffl- I
cult to buy ungraded below 'â â  . and some hold
ers are even firmer in their views. For foreign
varieties there is almost no demand and offer-
Ings are made by one firm at only hall" the j
importation price to clean out what they have
in hand.
"Apricots are steady, but the price is pro
hibitive, and trailing is consequently small.
Some are reported returned from Europe, the '
price In this market being larger than can be i
secured there .it present. It is said in the
trade that not an apricot will be left when
the new crop comes In.
"Peaches contlnu? firm and prices are too
high to admit of much trading. Consumers
will scarcely accept substitutes and some will
have peaches anyway, whatever tho cost. All
stocks are firmly held In view of present short- '
age and the possibility of a greatly reduced
crop this season."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May B Liquidation was quite
general In the stock market to-day and ma
t-rial declines prevailed. There was do news
of importance and disappointment at the bad
showing of the Lank statement on Saturday
Wemed to color speculative sentiment. Ster
ling exchange was alÂ«.ut steady and money
ily eafiier. Such ralli.-s as took place
were feeble and In each instance brought out
further sales, leaving the market at the end
weak at about the lOWWrt for the railways,
although son t the ipecialUes in the lute
Felling movement retained part of the advan-
I on an atternoon rally. Arbitrage
â¢- purchased some 80,000 snares during
die â  irei n weakiiM*, 'i' l|e market continued
feverish practically all day.- There was forced
liquidation of tnarelnal accounts by commis-
I tuses. Some lniportant lnt<-re.-in let go
on the assumption that rather larger
mobilities have been taken by certain un
ritlng syndicate*. The talk of the forma
t ;. q of a new ste.-i "trust" with a tremen
d. us capitalisation caused uneasiness In b >me
qu irters rtfultine In declines o; over t points

smartlr. Burlington losing over 2 points an I
Bt V^ul and Northweflt arKiut half as much.
Ami UK the coalers Delaware and Hudson and
Jersey Central were Uown over a i>olnt each.
New York Central suffered a loss of 2% In con- i
nection with Its unfavorable showing for April
compared with last year, although this Is partly
explainable by the earlier date at which navi
gation opened last year. Other weak spots in I
the railways were Baltimore and Ohio, Perm- !
sylvania, Union Pacific, C. C. and St. Louis, i
Northern Pacific and Missouri Pacific. Sugar j
and Lead were among the heavy Industrials, i
Amalgamated Copper sagged on the curb, which
caused Anaconda mlninc to be without sup
port. General Electric, which rose over a point, '
was the conspicuous exception to the market's
weakness. The deposit of $10,000,000 In warrants :
against the Treasury in a local bank which is
managing the transfer of the Spanish Indemnity
was taken to be the cause of the easier tone j
in money, as the operation had not been ex- j
pected until later this week. I
Some sharp declines were effected to-day In 1
active bonds, but the higher-grade issues only
receded moderately. Total sales, $2,750,000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May B.â Bullish State crop reports
and a belief among- traders that the Govern
ment report would show a sharp decline in the
condition started wheat firm. Trade was dull,
however, and the market turned weak under
heavy realizing. Favorable weather and the
blockade at Buffalo accelerated the decline.
July opened unchanged at 72> i SiC. advanced

. Receipts were comparatively light. \\ orld s
shipments to Europe were 8,820,000 bushels, and
wheat en ocean passage showed an increae of
2,112,000 bushels for the weeK.
Prospects of an Immense acreage and the tie
up In Lake navigation at Buffalo weakened
corn. . July closed 74C lower.
Large receipts and the weakness in wheat
and corn caused the downfall of oats. July |

small hog receipts strengthened provisions

year at Sit, 140 bags, against 77,196 during the
s.ame time last year. The sales from first
hands were 60,311 bags, against 60,434. The

23,41!! May 1, IS'JS, and the world's visible sup
ply May 1 was 6,311,558 bags, against 5,693,753.
The circular says:
"The demand has been good for nearly all
descriptions and prices about steady during
the first three weeks of the period we review,
but have since turned easier under more urgent
offerings by holders and the prospect of heavy
nearby arrivals.
"Costa Ricas have been mostly affected and
the decline in these has been considerably as
sisted by competitive offerings of similar coffee
from New York, with sales. Buying has been
fairly good, although dealers still move cau
tiously.
"Salvadors have turned dull and free busi
ness is not possible at our quotations Of I I.'"
7%c for current unwashed.
"Guatemalas show no new features, but are
easier !n sympathy with general conditions,
low grades excepted.
"The New York market for Brazil coffee
has Improved very slightly, spot No. 7 Rio be
ing ',80 better and futures rather tlrmer, but
Milds have not felt this benefit.
"To-day's iirst hand stock consists of f.613

PLUNGING ATTORNEY PARTED
WITH MUCH MONEY.
List of Creditors Are Anxious

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

Howard Emerson, the Centerville attor
ney whose sudden disappearance was ex
ploited in last Fridays Call, is still miss
ing and further investigations into hia
affairs reveal the fact that his accounts
are very much inor^ tangled than was at
first supposed.
A lift. Of anxious creditors has been
compiled, and it is evident that J B
Lanktree and County Clerk Jordan are by
no moans the only sufferers financially

ing money. Among those who are anx
ious to locate the missing lawyer are the
following, with the amount)' of their
claims, accompanying: Graham estate at
Newark, $560; James and William Fan

tively; H. Middleton, Boulder Creek mer

Dr. Emerson, Centerville's Health Offi
cer, is as yet unable to say how his ac
counts with hi.-= missing brother stand.
Howard was manager of the doctor's af
fnirs and It Is thought his loss will also
be considerable. Thus far not a word has
been heard from thÂ© missing attorney,
whose downfall Is attributed to the per
nicious effects of plunging at the Emery

Found Dead in His Room.
An Italian, whose name Is supposed to ;
be Antone Degurri, was found dead in
his room over an old stable on Florida
:, near Twenty-first, yestei
afternoon by Martin Taglio, who bas a
room in the same building. Taglio says
the last time lie saw Degurri alive was
Saturday night. At that time he waa
just leaving bis room, and said he was
going out to get a little fresh air. Not I
having Been his friend around Taglio yes
terday morning knocked on i-Â»eg U fri's
door and called him. He met with no j
response, so he lay down and looked
under the door. On the floor lay the life
less body of Degurri. Taglio was so
frightened that he left the place at once i
and went downtown. He met a friend,
who reported the case to the Morgue. ;
1 Â»eputy Coroner McCormick answered the '
call. He found the door of Degurri's
room locked with the key on the Inside.
The body lay Just beyond the door in a
â  f clotted blood. On the floor of the
rix.ni adjoining lay a bloody razor.
Everything In both rooms was covered,
with blood as though there might have i
b^en a struggle. The only wound on the
body was on the left arm just above the. |
elbow, where an artery was severed. \
The case looked somewhat suspicious, and ;
McCormick notified the police hefore
touching the body. Degurri was about 45
years of age, and had been employed as a
coal heaver in the railroad yards.

by the terms of the last will and testa
ment of his deceased wife. Hannah But
ler, which outs him off with $5
Hannah Butler, who was sometimes
known as "Hannah McCarthy," "Clara
White" and "Mrs. Anna McCarthy." died
in this city October 5, 1898, leaving an
estate valued at more than $9000 which
she disposed of by a will dated September
28, 1888, witnessed by Thomas F. Garrlty
and W. J. Donovan. Ry its terms a house
and lot at 920 Klrkham street are be
thed to Mary Hook, daughter, of
Patrick Hook. To Herman and John
Soupalre, grandchildren of testatrix. $2600
each Is bequeathed, and $1000 to a grand
niece. Hannah Leary. The husband Is
dismissed with $5, the testatrix "believing
that he has enough of money and prop
erty of his own." The will appoints
Brother Michael of San Rafael as
utor of the will and guardian nf John and
Herman Soupaire.
The will was admitted to probate to-day
by Superior Judge Hall, and Michael
Dorgan. better known as Brother Michael,
was appointed executor. Later in the day
Patrick Butler, through his attorneys
Fitzgerald & Abbott and J. E. McElroy,
liled suit against Brother Michael for the
recovery of (9000 community property.
In his complaint Butler alleges thai
plaintiff and Hannah Butler intermarried
April 25, 1880, and that through their exer
tions they jointly accumulated a large
amount of money, namely 19000, whirh ai
the time of the wife's death was In her
possession as custodian for plaintiff, it
being community property, that the
money at the time of her d< atb was de
posited in her name at divers banks In
Han Francisco and that now Michael Dor
gan has taken possession of the $9000,
claiming it as Hannah's sole and separate
property. Butler contends that the wealth
upon his wife's death becami his sole and
separate property and should not be sub
ject to a/lministration. He asks for judg
ment decreeing that Dorgan deliver the
money to him.
MRS. DINMORE IS
GRANTED A DIVORCE
The troubles of Walter R. Dinmore with
Us wife, also with his family-ln-law,
cnme to an end yesterday, and the once
Charming Mrs. Nannie L. Dinmore Is now
pretty Nannie L. Lewis.
Last Saturday Mrs. Dinmore filed suit
;i/?;iinst her husband for divorce, alleging
desertion and failure to provide as causes
of action. This suit, it Is now said, waa
the result of a compromise between the
parties to the action. A few months a.^o
Mrs. Dinmore applied for a divorce on
mnro serious grounds. Rh^ accused her
husband Of cruelty, solely of a mental na
ture, averring that he had a way of dis
torting the Queen's English, adding words
forbidden in Scripture and applying them
to her personality or habits. Those alle
gations are absent In the complaint upon
which the decree was granted.
By the terms of the compromise Mrs.
Dinmore agreed to withdraw all allega
tions reflecting upon her husband's honor
Or in any way calculated to bring the
blush of ehame to the cheeks of his chil
dren when they shall have attained ma
turity and seek for the cause that led to
the estrangement of those who gave them
birth.
The court also granted Mrs. Dinmore
the custody of her minor childrenâ Mary
Margan-t. aged seven years, and Henry
Clayton Dinmore. aged five yearsâ and the
right to resume her former name, Nannie
L. Lewis.
During the proceedings Dinmore and his

TWO BURGLARS
SET A LARGE
HOUSE ON FIRE
H. H. Mahan's Resi
dence Damaged.
FLAMES STARTED IN A CLOSET
THE MEN SEEN JUMPING THE
FENCE BY A BOY.
Fire Marshal Towe and the Police Are
Making a Thorough Inves
tigation Into th*
Affair.
Fire Marshal Towe, assisted hy Ser
geant Harper, made an investigation yes
terday morning into the fire Sunday night
at the residence of 11. H. Mahan. 2(H)1
Eddy street, and came to the conclusion
that the fire was started by burglars
either maliciously or accidentally.
The house contained nineteen rooms
and was valued at $25,000. About three
months ago Mahan. who used to be a
real estate agent, decided to sell the
house and furniture and live on his ranch
in Lake County. He disposed of all the
furniture except a bed for himself and
that contained in a front room occupied
by his daughter, Mrs. Heaney, and her
husband till a purchaser could be found
for the house. >
Sunday Mr. and Mrs. Heaney were nut
all day visiting friends and did not return
till 11:80 o'clock at night after the fire
was over. Mahan left the house about 6
o'clock tn go downtown for dinner, so
that thorp was no one in the house
The Investigation by the Fire Marshal
and Sergeant Harper showed that the
place had been entered by burglars and
a boy saw two men jump the fence and
run away as the flames shot through
the roof. Entrance had been effected
through the basement window and the
door leading from the basement had been
forced open with a "jimmy." the marks
being plainly visible. The burglars had
made their exit by unbolting the base
ment door. â 
They had carried a lamp from Mahan's
bedroom to a room upstairs, where Mrs.
Heaney had her dresses and linen stored
in the closet. it was in this closet where
the tire started, and it is supposed that
the burglars while using a candle or
matches to make a selection of the arti
cles had Bet fire to one of the dresses
either by accident or design, and observ
ing what they had done they fled. The
only article discovered missing was a val
uable overcoat longing to Mahan. The
loss to The building by the lire is esti
mated at about $6000.
The police are making every effort to
capture the burglars and fire raisers, but
as they have little or nothing to work
upon the, chances are that they will not
be discovered. The boy who saw them
jump the fence could only give an im
perfect description of them, as it was
dark and he did not get a good look at
them.

specifications for the new bridge. Ac
cording to a communication from Profes
sor Cory of the State University, the
specifications relating to the electrical
construction are faulty In not giving â¢
act details. Hence amended specifications
were submitted, providing tor two 25
--horsepower motors, which Professor Cory
believes will be sufficient capacity when
operated at the proper voltage to operate
the end lifts and turn the bridge under
the must favorable circumstances. The
new specifications which the Supervisors
adopted to-day also provide for the sub
stitution of a castiron disk containing
three holes to receive plugs for an in
definite number of electro-magnetic lock

The matt.r of fixing gas rates did not
ip In any form whatever.
The first Hurry over the gas proposi
tion arose when the bills for lighting the
various fire engine houses were presented
with the other minor bills tor current
expenses. Perrault moved that all the
bills with the exception of the gas bills
be allowed. Phelps wanted to know why
they were excluded.

Perrault's motion ally prevailed.
Later in the session the bills for light
lng streets and public buildings, both
with qua and electricity for the same
period came up, having been approved by
thtÂ» majority of the Finance Committee.
The tirst bill, aggregating $10,000, for light
ing streets with electricity, was read and :
Lackmann moved that action be Indefln
ltely postponed. The motion was defeat
edâAigoltlnger, Attrldge. Black, Collins,
Holland; Kalben and Phelpa opposing 11 . .
wlille Bylngton; Deasy, Hej'er, l.a.'kiivunn
and Perrault ippoi ted it." Perrault then
moved to postpone action until such time
as the gas company shall state what' ls
a fair and reasonable rate. This motion
was also lost by the same vote and then '
Phelps moved that tht bill be passed to
prim. The motion was carried by the !
same vote. â¢ â¢ rault changed his " vote .
from no to aye In order to make a motion
to reconsider at the next meeting. The
same action was token with eighteen
more bills tad the gas question was hung
up for another week.
The board refused to accept the reduc
tion of $iiHO 91 in the water bill for March,
made by the Finance Committee, and or
dered the total amount paid The bill
rendered was for $20,966, but it was shown j
that the company had been charging for
water lv Alta plaza and Alamo square
for years, while those parks have not
been under cultivation. The water com
pany, when it saw that Its game had
been discovered, voluntarily subtracted
Irom the March bill the amounts charged
for those squares, but the committee
wanted to hold out all the back charge
The same seven â¢ Supervisors would not
support the proposition because the gas
and water inspector, who has only been
in iiftlre. three months, did not know of
his own knowledge that water had not
been furnishfcd at those places during the
past four or five years. His statement
that the parks were I irren and showed
no Indications of having been under culti
vation was hardly â ' lent, but finally
the bill went over for a week.
1-ackmaim Introduced a resolution cull
ing the attention of the Board of Health
tv the .State quarantine service, supported
by this city and county, which he deemed
unnecessary In view of the Federal quar
antine. The resolution provided for turn
ing the quarantine boat over to the har- '
bor police, it was referred to the Health
and Police Committee.
Perrault's resolution providing that no '
supplies for the city of any description be
purchased unless by contract was lost
lhe resolution permitting coursing
p;c-ks to sell pools was postponed for two
weeks.
The Merchants' Association, having
been requested by Supervisor Perrault to
define its position in regard to the grant- â 
Ing of a franchise for an electric road
between Sixth and Sansome streets and
Tenth and Montgomery streets, sent In
a communication referring the board to
its communication of March IS last In
which thÂ« association objected to the
granting of an electric franchise on
Geary street between Taylor street and
Grant avenue and recommending that the
route be along Post street Instead. The
Second communication states that nothing
has transpired since thÂ«n to change the
position of the association and again
recommends that the board grant permis
sion for thti road to run along Post street.
Garret McEneraey; representing the
owners of the Columbian building, ad
jacent to the ruins of the Baldwin Hotel,
urged the board to refuse Baldwin per
mission to longer maintain the advertis
ing fence surrounding the ruins. He said
it worked a great hardship upon hi* cli
ents. >us their tenants were constantly
complaining of the nuisance. Mr. McEli
erney was Informed that the resolution
recently passed ordering the fence set
back to the building line was still in
force and the board could do nothing

callt-d attention particularly to the fol
lowing paragraphs, which were disre
spectful to the court, besides being un
true:
And whereas, said suit is still pending

ADVERTISEMENTS.
i^p lj I d^^-j I } I â â
A man has to have pluck to make a suc-
cess of any calling. A man must have the
backbone to take knock-down blows and
get up again and again and fight on.
Pluck and stamina are largely a question
of good health. It only takes one knock-
down blow to finish a man with a headache.
It only takes a small setback to disconcert
a nervous and shaky man. A bilious, head-
achy man goes into bankruptcy at the first
embarrassment. A nervous man who does
hot sleep" at night and gets up shaky in the
morning gives up the battle of business at
the first discouragement. Dr. Pierces
Golden Medical Discovery is the best of
all health-makers and health-keepers. It
makes pure, rich blood. It forces out all
imparities and disease germs. It does not
make any difference what the disease may
be called, so long as it has its inception in
improper or insufficient nourishmentâ this
great medicine will cure it. It may be
called dyspepsia, kidney disease, "liver
complaint," skin or blood disease, or nerv-
ous prostration â all these have the same
starting point. The " Golden Medical Dis-
covery " reaches that point. It will cure
these diseases absolutely. None of them
can retain their hold on the system when
the arteries are filled with rich, pure blood.
" I am 54 years old," writes Mr. F. O. Biedaoe.
of LeesviUe. Henry Co., Mo. " For 25 year* I
suffered from torpid liver, constipation and indi-
gestion which severely affected my nerves. Hav-
ing to make my living by hard work, I would
keep on until I would have to give up. Some-
times my friends would pick me up and carry me
to bed. What littl: sleep I could get wni tortured
with horrible dreanm. I took six bottles of Dr.
Fierce* Oolden Medical DUcovery. It relieved
the pain ia my back and between my shoulder*
hraoed up my acrves, Â»ad to-day I am a well
fuit," remarked Judge Morrow, with a
Blight touch of the Iceberg in his accents.
'"A mo.tion of this kind should como al
ways from the plaintiff."
Mr. Pillsbury thereupon being called
upon to say something, remarked that ho
was not prepared t" make th< motion, as
â u ici no! look well ior his siiie to come
Into court and uak for a dimissai, because
th< iniblic iniÂ«ht think that the suit had
not b'-i d commenced In faith, and it
would maJte a bad impression on the peo
ple.
Attorney General Ford then explained
that he ha<i been peremptorily ordered by
Railroad <'oniinissi.i!nrs to Â£et rid of
the case. "Now I must renew my motion
to dismiss, after striking out the objec
ble matter In the d< cree."
The court refused to grant the motion,

"Court's adjourned, said his Honor,
and the lawyers took up their books and
walked out.
Mr. Hayne wore a Maud Muller smile
all the way to the elevator.
At the meeting of \h>< Commissioners in
the afternoon Bar. Ford presented t! .
lowing written report:

"And It Is further ordered and resolved.

Instructed and ordered, as soon as he can
be heani by said Circuit Court, to secure a
discontinuance and dismissal of the cause
nnd temporary injunction mentioned and
specifically referred to in the above and
foregoing resolutions."
I'ursuant to said resolutions, and upon
notice duly gi\Vn. I this day moved in the
above-named court for a dismissal of the
above-entitled cause. My motion was de
nied upon the ground, as stated by the
Judge presiding, the Hon. W. \v Mor

honorable body on the 24th day of April,
IM3. and above referred to, did not con
f/irm to the facts as disclosed by the record
In said cause, and that the name were, in
effect, a reflection upon the above-named
court. I thereupon withdrew the resolu
tions referred to, at the same time assuring
the court that I -was certain that your
honorable body intended In nowise to re
flect upon said court. After a withdrawal
of said resolutions I again renewed my
motion to dismiss, which motion was again
denied by the court.

STOCKTON SEEKS JUSTICE.
Mnkesa Valiant Fight Against!
Railroad Discrimination in
Favor of Port Co-ta.
The fight between the merchants of:
Stockton and the Southern Pacific Com
pany, which has been waged almost con- '
ttnuously since the building of the over
land ro.td, a quarter of a century ago, was i
â¢<i yesterday before the Railroad
Commissioners. Stockton was represented
by Colonel George 11. Sperry, C. M. Web
er, Louis Frankenheimer, w. n. Harri-
Bon, Sigiamund Schwabacher, H. J. Cor
coran and It. D. Girvin. J. C. Stubbfl
â poke for the railroad Interests, being Bec
onded )>>â¢ Herman Bppinger and Qeorgi
W. McNear, warehouseman of Port Costa,
<'oii>ii"i Bperry presented the
Stockton, reading from a carefully pre
pared statement the argument which bis
people make against the proposed lower-
Ing of rates on wheat from points in Rnn
Joaquin Valley to Tort Costa, to the det
rlmeni of Stockton. During the course of.
th* 1 argument Which ensued EL .1. Cor
coran bitterly arraigned the railroad com
pany fur its attitude toward Stockton for
>â â¢â ;) rs p.-iM. He Bajd the railroad had al
ways bent its efforts toward injuring
Btockton and taking from it the advan
t m kÂ»-s which nature accorded it. He
quoted a statement credited to the late
â  A. N. Towne thai h<' would "dry up the
water course to Btockton and that some
day the grass would grow in the streets."
He held that In making rates on any I
commodity the railroad men always gave
Btockton the worst ot it. As one Instance
nt the methods employed In arriving al a
rate to be charged he cited that .>n
gTaln from Byron to Port Costa. This!
is r.o cents i>er ton for thirty-seven miles,
while It Is $1 per ton to Stockton, thirty
â¢ iKht miles, and under tho same cond'i- |
ttona. The explanation of the low rruo to
Port Costa was that the man who owned
tl).- warehouse at the latter point owned
another one at Byron and the action was â 
taken to favor him.
Mr. Stubbs, who was suave and
ready to answer any questions, reit
erated a sentiment once uttered by
0. P. Huntington, in which he said
the company charged "all the traffic
would bear."
Mr. Stubbs made the candid state
ment, "We fix rates at a certain fig
ure because we can get it."
Mr. Stubbs for the railroad said that
the railroad cornpnny had not been in
vl'.cd by tho CornmleslonoTÃ to send a rep
[rteentatiTe to the meeting; that he had
THE SAN FRANCISCO C&LXi, TUESDAY, MAY 9, 1899.
learned unofficially that the representa
tives of Stockton would be present and he
had attended to hear their arguments. On
behalf of the railroad company he enter
ed a formal protest against the reduction
of grain rates. He asserted that the
rates were reasonable and just according
to any standard of measurement that
might be applied. The rates of his com
pany, he said, were lower than those of
other companies operating on this coast
or in the middle Westâ they were below
the average and did not return a fair
! profit on operation, no dividends being
paid. It had been "found difficult to me<-t
Interest and expenses." He did not think
it was fair to change; that discrimination
1 had been questioned before, but not up
; held. Some rates are forced on the com
pany by competition, and whenever a rate
is questioned it is measured by these low
â  rates.
The Stocktonians claimed that the dif
!ai between Port Costa and Stock
ton had been reduced, to which state
ment Mr. Btubbs entered a denial. When
confronted with a tariff sheet on which
It was shown that to meet the rates of
the Valley ruad the company had dropped
a charge of 10 cents per ton fur unload
ing the grain at Port Costa. Mr. Stubbs
shuffled out of the hole by claiming that
the warehouse men were charged this I
instead of the shippers, as in the past.
For this reason the differential, which :
was on its face supposed to give Stockton :
its proportion of the traffic, did not in
reality have that effect. When the Val
ley road first entered Stockton a charge \
of ID cents a ton was made by the South- i
em Pacific Company for switching. Tho
warehouses were; on the water front and
distance from the main line of the
railroad. This was always an additional
â¢harge not contemplated when the dif
ferentia] was lixed at 50 cents per ton.
When the 10 cents per ton "unloading
fee" was dropped at Port Costa it re
duced the differential practically to 40
cents. This had the expected effect of ;
Bending the bulk of the trade to Port i
Costa.
Mr. Stubbs was apparently surprise]
at the formidable array of the Stockton j
men he found at the meeting, and said
he thought it indicated the weakness of
their cause. This the Stocktonians de- '
nled. saying it was because they knew
from long experience the strength of tne
opposition they would encounter.
The Commissioners took the case un
der advisement.
CORNELL MEN
SPEAK HIGHLY
OF DR. WHEELER
For Berkeley's New
President.
Thore will be a meeting of the Board of
Resents of the Stat^ University to-day.
Late last night the Regents had not been
advised that Governor Gape desir< '!
further postponement of the proposition
to elect a successor to Martin Kellogg,
president of the university. It is there
fore believed that the subject In which
the friends of the institution are so deep
ly concerned will come up for considera
tion to-day.
Professor William Carey Jones, who is
now connected with the university at
Berkeley, and fairly well known In this
will no doubt be recommended as
.1 suitable man to direct the affairs of the
Institution. A.s his accomplishments are
known, it is not necessary to review
I in in.
Professor Benjamin Ide Wheeler, whose
name will be presented to the Regents, is
not well known in California, but edu
cators who are familiar witrf his record
Bpeak of him as a man of genius and
festerday The Call invited an
expression of opinion regarding Mr.
Wheeler from Stanford professors and
Btudents who knew him at Cornell. The
responses follow:
Dr. Jordan says: "I know of no man more
likely to I'iw. a great university preÂ«
than Dr. Wheeler. He is a broad man, a forci
ble man, a man of executive strength, a clear
writer and a man of unblemished personal
le<l in public; affalrh, uiul
carrying a broad influence in whatever ue un

It. Orrln U Elllutt, registrar, says: "Pro
fessoi Wheeler has lonp been accounted one of
â  men a! Cornell. In addition to
being an accomplished scholar a.nd m.in of let
ters, he li a man of decided executive ability,
a r<'ady and graceful speaker, genial and cor
dial in hiii personal bearing."
>aor a. (i. Newcomer was a student un
der Professor Wheeler and expresses himself
as verj â¢â¢ ithuslastlc at the possibility of that
;ilnn Wost : "1 remember Profes
sor Wheeler particularly after hi? return "from
:;thusiastlc In hid
work and an inspiring teacher. I would like
nothing better than to see him at Berkeley.
The general impression at Cornell was that
r \A !.â¢â < lei would make a good execu
tive, li.- Is .tn eai rg<!i.-, insijlriiiK man."
VV. K. Dudley was on the Cornell
faculty \vitli Professor Wheeler and knows him
personally: "1 believe he would make an ad
mirable president. He is equal to almost any
emergency. H< is quick and full of rr*-, .
He is very energetic and has great capacity.

Bdmirablt basis. He Is a tine appearing man
with a magnetic personality. He is regarded
ac a thorough scholar. Independent and Oar
less, I ntious. 1 regard him as the
best available man that I know of."
Professor C D. M.-ir\ w;^ also on the Cornel!
factulty with Professor Wheeler. He sayH of
him: "Professor Wheeler is a brilliant and able

GROEZINGER COMES TO
THE GAMBLERS' AID
Declares the Anti-Bookmaking Ordi=
nance to Be Illegal.
City Authorities View the Decision as a Preposterous
Joke That Will Not Be Seriously Considered.
Mayor Phelan's Opinion.
JUSTrCE OF THE PEACE GOTT
LOR C. GHOEZINGER has decid
ed that the municipal ordinance
prohibiting pnolselling and bouk-
making on horseracing and dog
racing is unconstitutional. The deci
sion of Justice of tho Peace Groezinger
is viewed by public officialsâ judicial,
police and executive â with condemna
tion and laughter. The extraordinary
act of the Justice is looked upon more
as a preposterous joke than otherwise
and the general opinion is that no se
rious evil will result to the community
from the absurd court proceedings of
yesterday afternoon. The affair reaches
such a height of absurdity as to mean
that Groezinger, by his "decision." has
declared illegal and unconstitutional
every ordinance adopted by the Super
visors of San Francisco in the last
twenty years.
The ordinance prohibiting poolseliintc
and bookmaking became a law by iden
tically the same process as have all the
other municipal ordinances adopted in
this city in two decades. These ordi
nances have the approving stamn of
the Superior Court and of the Supreme
Court of the State, which tribunals
Justice of the Peace Groezinger calmly
reverses. The shrewdest and ablest
lawyers of California have exercised
every ingenuity and artifice of their
craft to destroy these ordinances, but
failure met every effort.
It should be understood that Justice
of the Peace Groezinger has not de
clared the anti-bookmaking ordinance
unconstitutional on the ground that it
abridges or violates any constitutional
rights of individuals or corporations.
nor that the Supervisors have arro
gated an authority not granted by th â 
laws of the city and State. These prob
lems Groestinger has not ventured to
discuss. He simply decided that the
prohibiting ordinance was not adorn,- l
under a certain prescribed form and is
therefore unconstituional.
Yet the prohibitory ordinance was
adopted in precisely the same way as
all others which have stood every legal
test There is consequently no concern
in the minds of the local authorities
over the result of Justice Groezinger's
action. The bookmakers of Ingleside
will not resume their nefarious busi
ness and the poolrooms will not re
open. The absurdity of Groeiinger'a
assumption may be seen further in the
fact that the court in which he tem
porarily presides is not a court of rec
ord, and possesses no jurisdiction to
test the constitutionality of a munici
pal ordinance. In addition to this
Groezinger is simply an acting Police
Judge temporarily clothed with the
authority of such an official.
The incident which excited Justice
Groezinger's decision yesterday after
noon was the second trial of H. L.
Jones, one of the gamblers of Ingle
side. Jones" attorney contended that
the records of the adoption of the anti
bookmaking ordinance by the Super
visors do not conform to the provisions
named in the consolidation act, and,
further than that, they have been mu
tilated. It is hardly necessary to say
more in answer to these contentions
than that John A. Russell, clerk of the
Board of Supervisors, and not only tin
greatest looal authority but acknowl
edgedly the greatest authority in mu
nicipal affairs In the United states.
made the records and stands ready to
establish their absolute conformity to
the law.
Hut Justice of the Peace Groesinger
listened to the bookmakers lawyer, re
fused positively to give the prose
cut ing attorney time to reply and out
of hand declined the anti-bookmaking
ordinance unconstitutional. Having
done that he at once ordered the jury
to acquit the defendant. The gambit r'fl
attorney, jubilant over his ready and
easily won success, asked Groezinger
to dismiss the charges against the
other defendants similarly accused.
The Justice pondered, hesitated and
then took the matter under advise
ment, He was not ready to accept his
own decision.
There wii.s a genuine surprise in store
for the people who crowded Groezin-
Ker's courtroom yesterday afternoon to
hear the second trial of the case of H.
L. Jones.
The acting Judge took upon himself,
as indicated, the responsibility of de
claring that the ordinance is unconsti
tutional on a technicality and ordering
the jury to bring in a verdict of ac
quittal, against the protests of Prose
cuting Attorney Carpenter and al
though Groezinger knew that Judge
Murasky has the same points under
advisement.
The jury had been selected Saturday
afternoon, and when the case was called
yesterday afternoon M. J. Boh&nnon,
one of the jurors, did not appear. After
waiting for half an hour both sides
agreed to try the case with the eleven
jurors. Attorney Ach at once, for the
defendant, moved for a dismissal, as
the complaint was defective, inasmuch
as it did not state a public offense. The
motion was denied.
Clerk Russell of the Board of Super
visors was the first witness called to
the stand. He identified a copy of the
ordinance passed by the board, and
against Ach's objection it was admit
ted as evidence. He produced the min
ute books of the board and read the
minutes referring to the introduction
and passage of the ordinance on March
6 and' l3.
In cross-examination by Attorney
Ach, Clerk Russell admitted that he
had considered the suggestions or ob
jections of Ach before Judge Murasky
well taken and he had made certain
alterations in the minutes since April
25. Ach submitted extracts of the min
utes of the meetings of March 6 and
IS and Clerk Russell left the stand.
Attorney Ach at once moved that the
case be dismissed on the broad ground
that there is legally no ordinance.
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter sug
gested that the jury be asked to retire
during the argument, and it was so or
dered. Ach then took the ground that
under the consolidation act the minutea
of the Board of Supervisors must show
that there was a regular meeting: that
there was or was not a quorum present;
that when a resolution Is passed the
ayes and noea must be given, and that
the fact that a resolution was ordered
to be published should be stated; but
in the minutes of March 6 and 13 all
these essential things were lacking. The
alterations were made, as acknowl
edged by Clerk Russell, after hearing
lii.s (Ach's) objections before Judge
Murasky and long after the defendant
was arrested. The fact of pasting a
clipping from a newspaper on the min
utes giving the ayes and noes was of
no account. He spoke for an hour and
Quoted authorities from many States
in the Union to support his argument
that legally, owing to the manner in
which the minutes were written up,
there was no ordinance.
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter re
ferred to the fact that Clerk Russell
had a system of keeping three minute
books, and out of the three all the re
quirements would be found, t
"< 'all in the Jury," said the Judge. As
soon as the jurors had taken their seats
the Jii'lgL' continued: "I am satisfied
that the order is unconstitutional, as it
was not properly passed, and as the
minutes hav< be< â¡ mutilated since the
defendant's arrest 1 shall instruct the
jury lo retire and bring in a verdict of
acquittal."
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter and
Captain Wlttman, who was seated be
side him, looked at each other in amaze
ment. Carpenter slowly rose to his
feet and said: "This is a complete sur
prise to me and I would ask for time
to prepare my' argument in reply to
my learned friend."
"You must do it now," retorted the
Judge. "I am satisfied that Attorney
Ach's arguments are right, and I again
Instruct the jury to retire and bring in
a verdict of acquittal."
The jury retired and returned in a
minute, the foreman saying that, as
instructed by the Judge, they would
return a verdict of acquittal. They
\vÂ» re then discharged.
"Now, your Honor," said Ach, suave
ly, "I will make a motion that the
cases of all the other defendants be dis
missed, as most of them have to go
East."
The Judge hesitated for a moment
and then said that he would reserve
his decision on the motion until to-day.
Clerk Russell was surprised and
not a little indignant when he was
informed of the action taken by Jus
tice Groezinger.
"Such a decision is preposterous,"
he said, "and is scarcely worth fur
ther comment. The minutes of the
board are complete in every respect
and show in detail every act of that
body. Not only is this true, but it
is also true that every requirement
of the consolidation act is fully com
plied with. Even if this were not so
the fact would not invalidate the or
dinance for the reason that the courts
have held time and again that the
legislative body of a municipality
need not necessax*ily follow in detail
the rules of procedure set down by
statute. This ordinance was passed
and its passage recorded in the same
manner as has marked the passage
and recording of every ordinance for
the past twenty years. The legality
of many of these ordinances has been
tested in the highest courts and have
been subjected to the earnest scruti
ny of the best legal minds in the
State, yet it has remained for a Jus
tice of the Peace to make this most
remarkable discovery. It is so re
markable that is is scarcely worth
discussing."
Mayor Phelan was inclined to
treat the matter as a joke, though he
declined to discuss it for the reason
that he was not fully advised as to
the legal aspects of the case.
"It is scarcely possible," he said,
"that the contention of Justice
Groezinger is correct, and I do not
think that any one need be concerned
about it. A Police Court is not a
court of record, and the decision of
Justice Groezinger stands for no more
than an individual opinion. I am in
formed that this question has been
passed upon by the highest courts in
the State and that it has been held
that an ordinance may not be de
clared invalid on such grounds as are
alleged by Justice Groezinger as a
basis for his most remarkable de
cision."
The members of the Board of Su
pervisors generally take the same
view of the case as does the Mayor.
They say that if the race track or
dinance is not a law then the city
has no laws. Supervisor Byington ex
pressed the common mind when he
said: "The courts will hold the or
dinance to be valid, Justice Groezin
ger to tne contrary notwithstanding.
Even in the improbable event that
they should not we cata pass another
ordinance that will be valid, and we
will do so if such action becomes nec
essary. There need be no apprehen
sion on the score of Justice Groezin
ger's action."
The minutes of the Hoard of Super
visors show for themselves the frail
foundation upon which the Justice of
the Peace bases his decision. These
minutes indicate with absolute clear
ness the purpose of the Supervisors
and the legality of their action in con
nection with gambling, and nothing
else is required. The first minutes in
reference to the meeting of March 6
when the ordinance was passed to
print, are as follows:
