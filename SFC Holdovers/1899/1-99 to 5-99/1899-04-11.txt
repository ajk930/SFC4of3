THE REBELS
DRIVEN FROM
SANTA CRUZ
Fatal Blow Struck at Insur
gent Supremacy on
Laguna de Bai.
LAWTON'S MEN WIN
They Are Booked to Follow the
Flying Natives Around
to Cavite.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, April 10.â The
town of Santa Cruz, the
modern capital of. La
guna province and the most im
portant place on Laguna de Bai,
is now in the hands of the Amer
icans, who. captured the town
this morninc;.
The expedition under command of
Brigadier Lawton, which
started from San Pedro -facate Satur
day evening to attack the rebels at the
southern end of Laguna de Bai and to
capture Santa Cruz, a hotbed of insur
gents, did not "each Laguna de Bai un
til midnight. The expedition, which
consisted of eight companies of the
Fourteenth Infantry, three companies
of the Fourth Cavalry, four companies
each of the First North Dakota and the
First Idaho Volunteers, two mountain
guns and 200 sharpshooters selected
from the Fourteenth Infantry and the
North Dakota and "Washington Volun
teers, was conveyed in fifteen native
lighters, which were towed by seven
tues. The lighters were heavily laden,
and considerable difficulty was experi
enced in navigating the Pasig River,
th* boats frequently running aground.
After the edition reached the head
of the river, which has its source in the
Lacuna de Pal. it was decided to wait
until daylight on Sunday before pro
ceeding across the lake.
As soon as the sun rose another start
was made, trie string of tugs and eas
cos moving off with the army gun
boats Laguna de Bai, Napldan and
Oeete in the lead.
a Tieax-y rain storm set In soon after
the start and the boats became some
what scattered and at 7 o'clock a halt
was made for half an hour to allow
them to get together again. While the
flotilla was waiting General Lawton
boarded the Laguna de Bai and held a
conference with the officers aboard of
her. The rain was accompanied by
very little wind, which was a fortunate
circumstance, as had the lake been
rough it would have been extremely
dangerous for the heavily laden cas
cos.
The boats were soon collected and the
expedition continued its voyage south
ward. At 9 o'clock a dense fog set in.
shutting out all view of the land. This
compelled another halt until the fog
lifted sufficiently to allow the pilots to
distinguish the shore marks.
Finally the expedition got within five
miles of Santa Cruz, where another
stop was made and the battalion com
manders were signaled to go aboard
the Laguna de Bai to receive final in
structions. While- these, instructions
were being given an insurgent steamer
was discovered two miles south of the
place where the expedition was lying,
but was not molested.
At 1 o'clock a roeonnoissanee of the
Ir.pu: nt positions was made by the
gunboats, the Napidan examining the
â  Â or Santa Cruz, while the La
guna de Bai reconnoitred to the nor^h
of the town and the Oeste to the south.
At half-past 1 the Napidan, which had
worked to the southward, opened fire
on the rebels, who were holding a posi
tion four miles south of the town. The
fire had continued but a very short
time, when hundreds of rebels could
be seen rushing in the direction of
Santa Cruz. They made no attempt to
reply to the American fire, but seemed
only intent upon getting out of range
of our guns. Many of them took to the
hills with such eagerness as io excite
derision among our troops.
The sharpshooters accompanying the
expedition were particularly anxious to
ashore, and when the order was
.. given for them to land cheered lustily.
They went ashore under the protection
of the guns of the Napidan, which
thoroughly shelled the woods in the
vicinity of the place selected for the
landing. The sharpshooters were fol
lowed by two battalions of the.Four
teenth 1 Infantry, under Captain Has-
brouck, and together attacked the
scattering enemy. The sharpshooters
proved themselves worthy of their
reputation. They picked off the Fili
pinos with precision and dispatch
whenever opportunity offered. And the
rebels were not long In discovering they
were affording targets for marksmen
â¢whose shots meant death, and took ad
vantage of every natural shield to pro
tect themselves in their retreat. â 
A battalion, of the North Dakota
I Regiment, under Major Fraim.and a
battalion of the Idaho Regiment,
commanded by Captain Linck, were
ordered to land after the other detach
ments had gone ashore. They were
at once deployed as skirmishers on the
left flank of the troops who were
marching toward Santa Cruz from the
south. The only opposition met with
was from small bodies of insurgents
who were in ambush at different places
along the route.
Meanwhile the Laguna de Bal was
attacking the rebels at the entrance of
the river. Darkness was approaching,
and the Americans were still two miles

HOBART'S
CONDITION
IS SERIOUS
VICE PRESIDENT GARRET A. HOBART. ?
6
NEW YORK. April 10. â Albert F. Wilcox, law partner and business
associate of Garret A. Hobart. has just returned from Washington,
and to-day made an authoritative statement as to the health of the
Vice President. A few days ago a report was current that Mr. Ho
bart's illness was of no moment, and that he was attending to business
at his Washington home. Mr. "Wilcox, at his office in Patexson, gave dif
ferent information
"Aside from the doctors and nurses and Mrs. Hobart," Mr. Wilcox
said, "I was the first person to be allowed to see Mr. Hobart. As it was,
I was only allowed to see him on condition that I would not remain in
his room, more than five minutes and would not mention business. Even
President McKinley is not allowed to see the Vice President. The great
trouble is that when Mr. Hobart talks even a little, a violent paroxysm
of coughing follows, continuing until he is completely exhausted, and
sleep becomes impossible. Until this sickness, Mr. Hobart, no matter
what the excitement of the day may have been, never knew what it was
not to be able to sleep. No mail matter is allowed to reach him and his
wife and physicians are devotedly working to protect him from his
friends."
PRESIDENT
TO PROCLAIM
PEACE TO-DAY
Ratifications of the Paris
Treaty Will Be Exchanged

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 10.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: Peace
will prevail between the United States
and Spain after 3 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon. At that hour the formal ex
change of ratifications of the treaty of
Paris will occur at the White House.
In anticipation of such exchange, the
State Department is preparing a formal
proclamation, which will be issued im
mediately after the ceremony, an- 1
nouncing to the world that peace once
more exists between the Madrid and
Washington Governments. Telegraphic
dispatches announcing the fact will be
sent to the American diplomatic repre
sentatives abroad, but no formal state
ment will be communicated to the dip
lomatic corps here, the members of
which will receive their Information
from the proclamation of the President.
Unlike many ceremonies of a similar
nature which have taken place abroad,
the proceedings to-morrow will be de
void of ostentation. None of the mem
bers of the diplomatic corps, except
Embassador Cambon, First Secretary
Thiebaut and Chancellor Boeufve. com
prising the French Embassy, will be
present, and the President will ba sur
rounded by Secretary Hay and other
officials of the State Department, sev
eral members of his Cabinet and the
Executive Mansion staff. â -:_ â ,'>;
In anticipation of the return of peace
consideration Is being given by the
President and Secretary Hay to the ap
pointment of a Minister to Spain and
reappointment of Consuls in that coun
try. It is the understanding. of the of
ficials that Spain will designate the
Due d'Arcos as Minister to this coun
try and the best information obtain

probably direct the transfer of Law

Call Headquarters. Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 10.
The funeral of Stephen J. Field will
occur Thursday morning at 10:30
o'clock. The remains will be placed in
a vault in Oak Hill Cemetery until Mrs.
Field decides whether to have the body
interred in California or in Massachu- j
setts. Her disposition at this time is
to have the remains taken to Cali
fornia, but Mr. Field's brother Is de
sirous that the ex-Justice be laid be
side his father and brothers at Stock
bridge. Mass. â  . i
Rev. Henry M. Field, the brother, ar
rived in this city late last night and
went immediately to the Field resi
dence. He is the only surviving mem
ber of the famous Field family, and un
til lately was editor of the New York
Evangelist.
Telegrams and messages of respect
have been received all day at the late
home of Justice Field. Early this
morning a handsome floral piece was
received from the White House bear
ing the cards of President and Mrs.
McKinley, with kindly sympathetic
messages of regrets. A number of
other floral tributes have also been re
ceived from members of the bar in this
city and from out of town.
Among the telegrams- received by
Mrs. Field was one from Embassador
Choate in London. The members of
the Supreme Court called at the Field
residence in a body to-day. â¢
The services here on Thursday will
be held in Epiphany Church and will
be private.
It was the intention to give the emi
nent jurist a public funeral in the Su
preme Court chamber, but in accord
ance with the wishes of the family this
plan has been abandoned and the serv
ices will be as simple and as private in
their character as the ritual of the
Episcopal church will permit.
The funeral will be attended by rep
resentatives of the District bar, and
the honorary pall bearers will be
members of the United States Supreme
Court, j " " \ :-%~f â : â

Formal Objection to the In

THIS LOOKS SERIOUS
Great Britain and America Asked

Special Dispatch to The CalL
NEW YOR-C April io.â
The Washington correspondent
of the Herald telegraphs: For
mal objection to the installation
of Malietoa Tanu as King of Sa
moa by the American and Brit
ish officials at Apia was regis
tered to-day at the State De
partment by Embassador yon
Holleben.
Similar action is understood
to have been taken by the Ger
man Embassador in London.
The German Government
feels that in the enthronement of
Malietoa Tanu the United States
and Great Britain have violated
I the terms of the treaty of Berlin,
| which enjoins the installation of
1 either Mataafa or Malietoa
Tanu as King. The Washing
ton and London Governments
I should have waited for the re
port and findings of the commis
| sion which is to be appointed to
investigate the entire Samoan
question.
Malietoa Tanu having been
installed, Germany thinks that
in justice to herself the two Gov-
I ernments should return the situ
i ation in Samoa to that which ex-
isted prior to his installation. It
is not believed that the officials
propose to take any such action.
Germany has been informed,
however, that the United States
is quite willing- that the commis
sion shall consider the Kingship
question, and this is the farthest
this Government will probably
go-
The German Government has
also objected to the course of
Rear Admiral Kautz in the mat
ter of the dissolution of the pro
visional government and the
shelling of Mataafa's forces, and
is inclined to support Herr Rose.

began patrolling the streets throughout

townspeople, over the shooting of the
citizens and women. V : ' ; -'"
Henry Stevens, a negro miner, who has
long been considered a leader among his

MYSTERY IN
DREYFUS CASE
IS INCREASED
Private Secretary of Colonel
Henry Follows His Master
to a Suicide's Grave.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS. April. 11.â Louillier,
who was private secretary to
the late Lieutenant Colonel
Henry, who committed suicide
at Mont Valerien Fortress last
August after confessing to hav
ing forged a letter largely in
strumental In delaying the
Dreyfus revision,' killed 'â  himself
last evening. Louillier was a re
tired sergeant-major of . artillery
and had been in ill health. After
Henry's suicide he lived at Saint
Quern in in Isna, where he com
mitted suicide on receipt of a
telegram summoning him to
Paris.
PARIS, April 11.â The Figaro this
morning publishes the evidence given
before the Court of Cassation in the
Dreyfus, case by General Gallifet, ex-
President Casimir-Perier;- General La
Roche, under whom Freystaetter serv
ed in Madagascar; Professor Ocagne of
the Polytechnic School; Lonquety, the
witness referred to by General Roget
as having seen Dreyfus in Brussels;
Professor Painlove and M. Hadamard,
Dreyfus' cousin. General Gallifet said
he knew nothing about the confession
said to have been made by Dreyfus.
Only Darras, who was the commander
on the occasion of Dreyfus' degrada
tion, went to General Gallifet that aft
ernoon to express his pain over the in
cident. He said that Dreyfus had never
ceased to protest his innocence. Gen
eral Gallifet did not know of the drum
rolling incident. Asked his opinion re
specting Colonel Picquart, General Gal
lifet replied: "He served five years
under me and earned the profoundest
esteem of Generals Brault, Darras,
Bailloud and Millet. He was loved and
respected. It was with the greatest
pleasure that I gave evidence in behalf
of Colonel Picquart."
General Zurlinden sent a message to
General Gallifet to say that his evi
dence had produced the best effect.
General Zurlinden promised to ask for
the lightest disciplinary punishment in
consideration of Picquart's preliminary
punishment at Mont Valerien. Hence
the witness was astonished when Gen
eral Zurlinden a month later inflicted
the heaviest punishment. General Gal
lifet was asked to intercede in Pic
quart's behalf, but formally refused to
do so, though, he added, he had never
withdrawn his affection for him. Gen
eral Gallifet declared that when it be
came known that he was to give evi
dence he was solicited by the generals
not , to. appear. They were persuaded
that Esterhazy was innocent and Pic
quart guilty.
Marquis de Gallifet testified that the re
lations of Comte Esterhazy with the for

PRICE FIVE CENTS.
BALTIMORE, Md., April 10.â In
anticipation of the probable early
demise of the Pontiff, who, while
reported to be in no immediate
â¢ danger, is nevertheless not likely
to live many days by reason of his ad
vanced age and feebleness, The Call's
correspondent came here to have an
audience with his Eminence, Cardinal
Gibbons.
Though having attained the eminence
of a Cardinal he, like the Pope, cele
brates mass regularly and is, as well, a
father confessor. He was in the con
fessional of the cathedral when The
Call's 'representative was received at
the residence.
Cardinal James Gibbons received his
red cap at Rome in 1886. He is sixty
five years of age, but appears much
younger. His figure is slight; he Is
something below the average height.
His- features are clear-cut, and keen
gray eyes brighten with a most kindly
expression while he talks.
"Your Eminence, the San Francisco
Call has asked me to visit you and ask
you to tell its readers something about
the condition of the Pope, his possible
successor in case of his demise and the
manner of electing a Pope in the Sacred
College."
Cardinal Gibbons replied:
"I thank you for your visit and thank
the San Francisco Call for its interest.
There is not much that I can tell you
concerning the physical condition of
his Holiness. The press dispatches
keep me better advised than private re
ports from Rome. While we all hope
and pray that he may live yet for many
days he is a very old man.
"As to the selection of his successor,
we shall not discuss that to-day. As
to the manner of his election by the
Sacred College it is well known that
the Cardinals perform this duty in the
Vatican at Rome. I understand that
the Rev. Peter A. Bart, a most able
man and formerly resident' of Balti
more, is the author of a little volume
giving an account of this most interest
ing and impressive ceremony, and I
could not do better than recommend
that you examine it."
The Call representative suggested
that his Eminence had been mentioned,
especially in Paris, as a most worthy
successor to Pope Leo XIII.
Cardinal Gibbons smiled in depreca
tion of this suggestion, and shook his
head sadly.
"No, I would rather stay at home,"
said he.
An article recently published, giving
an account of a ceremony attendant
upon the death of a Pope, was called
to his notice.
' "Yes," said he, "at -the death of the
Pontiff it has been the custom for near
ly two thousand years to attest his dis
solution by tapping the forehead with
a silver mallet, after which the fact of
his demise is formally promulgated.
There is, from time to time, a deviation
from these ceremonies, but I believe
the one you mention has been changed
little, if any."
Pope Sixtus V fixed the number of
Cardinals at seventy, but at the present
time there are only fifty-seven. Fol
lowing are their names:

BRA'S DISCOVERY
OF CANCER MICROBE
Tells of His Researches, but Mod

Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James

PARIS* April 10. Dr. Bra, whose discovery in regard to the cancer
microbe I cabled, In an interview' confirms the statement that he has
succeeded in isolating the parasite which Is invariably present in can
cerous growths. It is a fungoid of the ascomycetes family, and cer
tainly the active agent of cancer. Inoculations of animals with a culti
vation produced cancerous tumors, from which the parasite was again
isolated. With the modesty of the true scientist Dr. Bra declines to
hold out premature hopes for a curative treatment for cancer. So far
he has only made Insufficient clinical experiments, but he admits that
these are very encouraging and says he will be able to speak with cer
tainty in a few months.

from the church ln the town. A halt
was made just before dark and the
troops bivouacked. In the gray of
dawn this morning the advance was
continued. The rebels attempted to
make a stand and hold the town, but
their efforts were fruitless and the
troops drove them before them and oc
cupied the place.
At sunrise to-day the assault com
menced. The American lines south of
the City; stretched two miles Inland and
with its left sweeping the shore, It
moved north, while the Fourth Cav
alrymen on the point to the north ad
vanced toward the city, pouring vol
leys on the trenches. Simultaneously
the gunboats hovering along the shore
shelled the woods ahead of the troops,
driving the Filipinos inland. The Gat
lings cleared several trenches.
The whole brigade was divided into
squads of twelve and the fighting was
carried on in the old-time frontier
fashion from behind trees, crawling
through bushes or running across the
open. The trenches that were not
cleared by the gunboats gave consider
able resistance when the line was near
ing the city and the Laguna de Bal
and Oeste bombarded for an hour in
the hope of making them too warm for
occupancy, but did not succeed ln
clearing them entirely.
General Lawton, with the Fourteenth
Infantry Battalion, approached a nar
row iron bridge across a creek on. the
south border of the town. Here a com
pany of Filipinos was Intrenched across
the stream and behind a stone barri
cade at the entrance to the bridge.
The Americans rushed forward In sin
gle file in the face of a galling fire,
demolished the barricade with their
hands and drove the enemy from the
trenches, killing a dozen.
The Filipino soldiers In the town, se
creted in various buildings and firing
from the windows, gave the Invaders
an interesting hour. There was a regu
lar nest of them In the stone Jail, which
is edged in by a wail. This was a veri
table pepper pod. The Americans,
singly or In pairs, entered the houses
and many warriors were taken prison
ers. A considerable number of Fili
pinos fled northward, crossing the open
marshes, but the Gatlings poured upon
them a deadly hail until they disap
peared in the woods, slaying dozens.
Major Weisenberger . deployed the
sharpshooters along the shore and they
crept steadily forward, aiding the Gat
lings. Finally a large body was sent
against the enemy in the woods, driv
ing them toward the mountains.
General Lawton established head
quarters at the elegant palace of the
Governor, and a guard was immediately
placed in the church, as the sacred edi
fices are always the first objective of
looters. Within an hour the town was
patrolled and all looting rigidly pre
vented. Almost all the Inhabitants had
fled during the two preceding nights and
only a few Chinese shopkeepers have
emerged from hiding and resumed busi
ness.
On the marshes north of town were
found forty dead Filipinos, some terri
bly torn by shells and many others
wounded. To the wc-unded the Ameri
cans offered their canteens as though
they were comrades. A surgeon who
traversed the field counted eighty killed
and General Lawton will report at
, least, sixty-eight One Filipino, at
: tempting to make his escape, slashed
viciously at Major Welsenberger, who
shot and killed him.
Yesterday the insurgents captured
two men of the Fourteenth Infantry,
while unarmed, but the Americans
stole the guns of their captors, clubbed
them, hid in the trees overnight and re
turned this morning.
The gunboats this afternoon have
searched the Santa Cruz River for ship
ping.
To-morrow the expedition will push
forward, the Americans having de
; stroyed miles of telegraph lines, cutting
I off insurgent communication east and
j west.
Chairman Schurman of the United
States Philippine Commission expresses
great gratification at the change in the
attitude of the Spanish newspaper,
Oceania, whose pro-Filipino utterances
two months ago nearly caused Its sup
pression. The paper now earnestly ad
vises the insurgents to submit to
American authority. The good effects
of the commission's proclamation in
Manila is noticeable in the increased
feeling of confidence among the people
of the city. General Lawton took sev
eral copies of the proclamation for dis
tribution among the natives when he
departed on his expedition to Santa
Cruz.
A company of Insurgents advancing
along the railroad attacked an Ameri
can outpost in front of Malolos early
this morning, but was repulsed. Two
men of the Twentieth Kansas Infantry
were wounded.
The Spanish garrison, comprising
forty-seven men, is reported to have
been holding the town of Baler on the
east coast of the Island of Luzon, since
last May. The gunboat Bennington
has been sent to investigate the case
and to relieve them.
The steamer Brutus, believed to be
long to the Manila Maritime Company
and to have been erroneously reported
as being the United States supply
sfeamer Brutus, has arrived at Balarac,
thirty miles south of Palawan, with her
shaft broken. Assistance has been sent
to her.
LAWTON'S FORCES TO
SCATTER THE ENEMY
WASHINGTON, April 10.â War De- |
partment officials are delighted over I
General Lawton's initial victory at j
Santa Cruz. They decline to divulge I
the plan of campaign which General
Lawton has undertaken, but admit that |
It is strategically designed to demoral
ize and scatter a large portion of the
enemy's forces menacing Manila and I
its suburbs. It is suspected that the
expedition will sweep rapidly from I
Santa Cruz around the southern shores j
of Laguna Bay and flank the insur
gents in Cavite province, hemming
them In between two fires. Santa Cruz
is only about fifty miles straightaway
to the southeast from Cavite and Ma
nila, and, although the intervening
country Is much like a well-watered
Jungle north of Manila, it possesses fair
roads, with the distinct advantage that !
there are few towns to offer the enemy i
strongholds for resisting Lawton's j
rapid advance.
The tactics in carrying out the second
part of the programme, it Is expected,
will be those of old-time frontier fight
ing.' The command will be divided into
squads of twelve men, under non-com
missioned officers, all keeping in close
touch. Thus the country can be
thoroughly and effectively swept of the
Taeallos.

ex-attache, once expressed to me," he
said, "his utter astonishment that Ester
hazy â¢ was still at liberty, since It was
common knowledge among all foreign at
taches that for one or two thousand
francs Esterhazy would furnish all the
particulars the foreign attaches could not
get directly from the Minister of War."
General Gallifet did not report General
Talbot's â¢ statement because Esterhazy's
relations with the attaches were known
to all the staff. General Gallifet expressed
astonishment .at licquart's treatment,
adding significantly: "I believe the crime
was the same as led to the Journey east
and the .mission to Tunis."
M. Caslmlr-Perler began his statement
by expressing a desire, In. the face of the
divided state of tho country, to place
himself unreservedly at the service of
the tribunal and to answer all questions
that might he asked. He Bald he was
unable to give the exact date when Gen
eral Mercier, then Minister of War, ac
aualnted him with the Dreyfus a.ffalr.
eneral Mercier first alluded ln a general
way to the small confidence the general
staff placed ln Dreyfus, adding that the
Ministry of War had been Informed of the
communication of a document to a for
eign power and had learned from a for
eigner that leakages had occurred from
the general staff, but M, Caslmlr-Perler
said he was led to believe that all this
merely concerned oral communications
and he had no knowledge that any docu
ments had passed. On January 6, 1893, he
received a visit from Count yon -funster,
the German Embassador, who communi
cated to him an official and personal de
mand of Prince Hohenlohe, the German
Chancellor, that he, as President of the
republic, should formally deny that the
German embassy was involved in the
Dreyfus affair.
M. Caslmlr-Perler told the court that,
in reply to Yon Munster, he pleaded his
constitutional responsibilities, .but of
fered as a private Individual to give every
assistance. Then he Informed the Ger
man Embassador that the document In
question had been found at the German
embassy. Count yon Munster replied that
this appeared to him impossible, adding

"AMERICANS ARE A
NATION OF LIARS"
So Says Herron During
a Lecture.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 10.â "American Im
perialism" was ' ; the subject which
George D. Herron took for his lecture
this morning before the Christian Citi
zen's League. He dealt rigorously with
the question, and called the Americans
a nation of liars. He said because of
our betrayal of the Cubans and Fili
pinos our honor was a byword and a
thing to sneer at among the peoples of
Europe. We could no longer be be
, lieved, he said, and in Germany and
France the promise of an American was
not worth the breath it took to utter it.
Central Music Hall was filled with
admirers of Herron's sentiments, and
the heartiest applause greeted his de
nunciation of the nation's present
course.
"A few months ago," he said, "this
nation had the chance of the age; a
chance to initiate a new kind of inter- ;
national politics and diplomacy. It had
an opportunity to appear as a sort of |
Messiah. among the nations, but its
course has been only one of betrayal
and falsehood. The nation -has chosen
darkness when glowing light comes
from its' political traditions.
"War came. Every appeal to arms
in the history of the world has brought
a new tyrant, and the Spanish-Ameri
can conflict was no exception. War
came. In opera bouffie and spectacular
language we called it 'war for hu
manity.' We stood pledged to disin
terestedness, pledged to simply free a
burdened people. What is the result?
We stand before the nations of the
world as perjurers, as a people whose
word cannot be trusted ln anything.
In Europe American honor is a scan
dal; it is a thing to sneer at. In Ger
many and France an American's word
will not be accepted in anything, and
we deserve the shame.
"The war has been simply a dress
rehearsal of the tragedy of greed that
is apparent in every Industrial center
in America. It was a war of money
changers, ahd this administration's
promises will never be kept. This ad
ministration will never set Cuba free;
it never intended to. Its whole object
Is to stir up civil strife in the island,
that it may have an excuse for annexa
tion.
"Let us consider the Philippines. We
found the people almost on the verge
of victory. We Invited their exiled
patriots to return and conjured them
in helping us whip Spain. It has been
argued that the Filipinos are unfit to
govern themselves. Why, in the Fili
pinos we found a people far better
qualified to master the intricacies of
self-government than were our fore
fathers when they fought England for
liberty.
"The Filipinos had the beginning of
a worthy national life, yet we have
murdered them by wholesale. Not con
tent with slaughtering the men, our
soldiers have shot -'own scores of
women around Manila. We have
shamefully treated their envoys. Our
commission scorned them in Paris, and
the Filipino representative had to flee
practically for his life from Washing
ton. Russia offered no worse treat
ment to the emissaries from Turke
stan. This nation has been outrageous,
infamous, tyrannical and dastardly."
many documents, but that no important
communication could have escaped.
To this M. Casimlr-Perler answered that
happily the document was not regarded
as important and that neither he nor
the Government desired to Implicate the
German embassy in the affair; that noth
ing had been proved to show that the em
bassy solicited the document and the
Government did not wish to hold the em
bassy or themselves responsible for pa
pers thus conveyed. It was sufficientâ the
papers having been found at a foreign
embassy and presumably emanating from
a French officerâ to fix the guilt of that
officer.
"As Count yon Munster Insisted on ob
taining a note categorically exculpating
the Embassy," continued M. Caslmlr-
Perler, "I suggested that it would be
unnecessary to indicate the Germany Em
bassy alone, but that all the embassies
and legations in Paris should be included
as each might remain under suspicion if
the German alone were exculpated. Such
a note, I said, It was the province of the
president of the council . to issue and I
suggested that It need not differ from
similar notes previously Issued. On the
Embassador's request I appointed another
Interview with the president of the coun
cil, but a few days later Count yon Mun
ster Informed me that the Incident might
be regarded as closed."
M. Caslmlr-Perler, continuing, said he
had only heard of a single secret docu
ment, the one containing the expression,
"Cette canaille de Dâ devlont rooloment
trop exigeante" (that beast of a Dâ Is
really becoming very exacting). General
Mercier Informed him some days before
Dreyfus was condemned (December 23,
1894,) that this document was submitted
to the court-martial, but he (M. Caslmlr-
Perler) did not understand that the docu
ment was only submitted to the Judges.
Reverting to his Interview with Count
yon Munster. M. Caslmlr-Perler said he
desired to place It upon record that an
act of treason had not placed a foreign
power in possession of important doc
uments affecting the national security.
Some days after Dreyfus was con
demned General Merger spoke to him
concerning confessions by Dreyfus, but
he could not remember that Captain Le
brun Kenaud ever came to the Elysee
Palace to inform him of these avowals.
The confessions having been published,
Captain Lebrun Renaud was sent to the
Elysee to be reprimanded. He did not
deny his Indiscretions to the press, but
said nothing about any confessions to M.
Caslmlr-Perler.
The latter concluded by asserting that
he knew no other facts and had no knowl
edge of any letters from Emperor Wil
liam. He declared that he had never
heard them alluded to except ln M. Pas
chal Grousset's Interpellation.
M. Laroche, former Resident General ln
Madagascar, who was called for the de
fense, testified that Captain Fraey-Staet
ter, a member of the court martial, told
him Dreyfus was convicted for giving out
plans of the fortress of Nice.

HISTORY OF THE
MURDOCK NOTE
TOLD IN COURT
MRS. MARY HELEN MURDOCK-
WILLOWS, April 10.â
taking of evidence in the
celebrated Murdock note
case, involving the validity
of a note for $100,000, with
interest amounting to $250,000, alleged
to have been drawn by the late Wil
liam Murdock in favor of Mrs. Gawn
Murdock, the wife of a relative, began
in the Superior Court here to-day.
There was an immense array of legal
talent on either side. Attorney Wil
liam Cannon, in his opening statement
to the jury, gave for the first time the
facts regarding the note which Is al
leged by the defense to be a forgery.
He declared the paper was executed by
William Murdock in settlement of
money due the decedent's brother,
Samuel. The latter requested that the
note be made out In favor of his daugh
ter-in-law, to become due at about the
time his grandchildren became of age.
This was done and tjef ore the note be
came due and was presented William
Murdock died.
Mr. Cannon said the note bore date
of September 5, 1877, and was for $100,
--000, payable twenty years after date,
with interest at 1 per cent a month.
He told of William Murdock coming to
this section in early days; how he
raised cattle and sheep and acquired
land. He had a cousin, Samuel Mur
dock, who had a son, Gawn W. Mur
dock, husband of the plaintiff. Mr. and
Mrs. Gawn Murdock had two sons,
Stanley and Edwin. Explaining the
consideration for which the note was
given Attorney Cannon went back to
the time of 1861-62. Samuel Murdock
was raising sheep. He loaned William
$4000. After this and up to 1877 he
loaned William other large sums of
money, as there was a big profit in wool
and sheep and these profits were placed
in William's hands. Gawn went into
partnership with his father and ob
jected to turning over the earnings to
William. A bitter feeling sprang up
between Gawn and his father on this
account. In 1876 the partnership 'was
dissolved. A settlement was effected
in 1876, by which Gawn agreed to pay
to his father $15,000 for his interest.
This amount was turned, over to Wil
liam by Samuel. Between 1876 and
1877, when the note in controversy is
alleged to have been made, the feeling
between father and son became so bit
ter that Samuel left the house of Gawn
and stayed with his cousin, William.
for two months. During this stay Wil
liam told Samuel that Gawn had not
made a just settlement with him. Gawn
was threatened with a lawsuit, and to
avoid it paid his father $20,000 ln cash
and notes. This was a short time prior
to the execution of the $100,000 note by
William Murdock to Gawn Murdock's
wife.
Samuel had returned to Gawn's house
In the meanwhile. Mary Helen Mur
dock's relations with her father-in-law
were always friendly and the affec

TRIAL OF QUAY
IS COMMENCED
Jury Chosen in the Con-
spiracy Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, April 10.âEx-Sen
ator M. S. Quay and his son, Richard
R. Quay, were called to the bar of the
Court of Quarter Sessions to-day. and
after many months of vexatious delay
the .trial of the two defendants was
begun.
There was an entire absence of any
crowd either outside. or in the court-
I room. Special cards of admission per
â  mitting only those directly interested
i in the case, witnesses, Jurors and news
! paper men, had been Issued by the Dis
i trict Attorney and counsel for the de
fense. Even members of the bar who
1 were not in the case were denied ad
mission. As a result of these arrange
! ments the courtroom was but little
i more than half filled and the greater
portion of those present were witnesses.
Judge Piddle, one of the oldest and
most respected members" on the bench,
.was the trial judge. ; District Attorney
j Rothermel, after two houra had been
I spent In selecting a jury, elected to try
; ex-Senator Quay first on that one
i 'of the five indictments (in which he and
tered on his two grandchildren, the
sons of the plaintiff. Finally there was
a settlement between William and
Samuel. They met at Gawn's house
and Mrs. Murdock was present when,
in the settlement, the balance was
struck at $100,000. At Samuel's request
the note was made payable to Mrs.
Murdock, but was to be for the benefit
of the two. grandsons, Edwin and Stan
ley. The note was made payable twen
ty years after date, so as to fall due
about the time the boys became of age.
As to the interest rate Attorney Can
non said the usual rates in those days
were from 1% to 1% per cent a month
and the rate given in the note really
was lower than usual. Subsequently,
and up to the time of William Mur
doch's death, Mr. Cannon said, it would
be proved beyond dispute that William
admitted at various times the execu
tion of the note and the facts as to the
consideration.
The attorney said he would show that
Mrs. Murdock, the payee, took the
note and that it was buried on the
premises. The note was wrapped or
rolled around a pencil, then placed in
a vial, corked and sealed; then placed
In a larger bottle and corked and then
In another bottle, also corked. This
bottle was placed in a tin can, which
was topped with a saucer, and buried.
It remained burled for ten or eleven
yearsâ 1887 or 1888. Attorney Can
non said he would prove that one of the
executors, before the existence of the
note was made public, acknowledged
that he knew of it and that, if Murdock
had lived one week longer the note
would have been compromised. Said
Mr. Cannon:
"The Issue in this case is clearly
drawn. On the one hand the jury will
be called upon to say whether it ac
cepts the sworn testimony of the peo
ple whose reputation for truth, honesty
and integrity is beyond reproach; the
testimony of witnesses who will give
facts which came under their own ob
servation; or whether the jury will ac
cept the opinions, inferences and de
ductions of experts who do not testify
as to facts, and who are hired by the
defense in this case to come into court
and swear this note out of court and
swear the charge of forgery upon the
plaintiff in this action at so much per
swear."
Gawn Murdock, husband of the
plaintiff, was the first witness called.
He told of the business transactions
between his father and William Mur
dock. He identified the note as the one
signed by William Murdock in 1877.
Grove L.. Johnson, for the plaintiff,
asked that the note be Introduced in
evidence. This was objected to by
General Barnes, on behalf- of the de
fendants, on the ground that the note
could not be Introduced, as the claim
never had been properly presented to
the executors. The argument on this
question will take place to-morrow, the
jury having been excused until 2
o'clock. If the defendants' point is
good the case ends. Plaintiff's attor
neys, however, contend that it certainly
will be knocked out.
his son are variously named) which
charges Mr. Quay and the late ex-
State Treasurer Benjamin J. Haywood
with conspiracy in using the State
funds for their personal benefit and
profit and in a manner unauthorized
by law. This action practically leaves
the ex-Senator alone on trial.
Beyond the selection of a jury and
the examination of one witness,
Thomas H. Barlow, receiver of the
Peoples Bank, nothing was done to
day. The jury was cured after thirty
five talesmen had been examined, four
teen of whom were stood aside by the
District Attorney, one excused and one
challenged for cause. The latter was
Talcott Williams, one of the editors of
the Press of this city, which Is opposed
politically to Quay.
The defense then exhausted Its priv
ilege of four peremptory challenges
and the commonwealth took advantage
of but three of the challenges.
The only witness examined to-day,
Mr. Barlow, led to the first clash be
tween counsel and apparently Indi
cated that a determined legal battle,
replete with knotty points of law, will
be fought in the trial of the case. The
District Attorney called Mr. Barlow to
identify books and papers found by him
when he assumed the receivership.
Mr. Shaplelgh of counsel for the de
fense, undertook to crow-examine the
witness with respect to his knowledge
of whether certain books, which the
defense, It Is understood, claims are
missing, are Included In those testified
to by the witness.
This was objected to and after re
peated consultations among the coun
sel for the defense and several other
efforts to obtain an answer to the ques
tion in another form it was abandoned,
and Mr. Shaplelgh said he would begin
his cross-examination ln the morning.

CHIEF DEVERY
HOW DEFIANT
Talks Up to Legislative
Investigators.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 10.â Only two
witnesses of any importance were put
on the stand before the Mazet legisla
tive investigating committee to-day,
and though the investigation continued
for a number of. hours into the after
noon no particularly convicting evi
dence was brought out. The investi
gating committee adjourned its session
until next Friday, when the chief wit
ness will be Richard Croker.
Frank Croker, son of Richard Croker,
was on the stand all morning. He tes
tified that he had paid $17,000 to enter
the Roebling Fire Proof Company, and
was drawing a salary of $2500 from it
to "learn the business." Young Croker
first said he had given for his 170 shares
of stock a check for the amount men
tioned, but when asked if he would
produce the canceled check he grace
fully worked into an admission that the
stock was paid . for in cash furnished
by his father. He said he had got the
money in big bills from his home ahd
kept it in his room all night. He told
of being presented with $6000 worth of
stock in the United Company, "be
cause," he said, "they knew we had
lots of friends in. railroads and such
places." j ' vA--- v '>' .' ~ '
Chief of Police William S. Devery
was again Â« put upon the rack after
Frank Croker had given his testimony.
Much of the questioning of the police
captain was similar to that of Satur
day when he was asked to explain the
existence of many disorderly resorts in
the city that flourished at all hours of
the night. Devery said that the police
department had done all it could do
with the evidence that it had before it.
to close such places. Devery denied
that he knew of any high official of
the city who was interested in pool
rooms.
W. P. Tostevin was called as the first
witness. He made some comparatively un
important corrections in his testimony of
Saturday. He admitted that he had no
personal knowledge of money having been
accepted by any one connected with the
building department.
Thomas Walker, a builder under Indict
ment for violation of the building law,
testified that he had been approached by
a man who offered to procure dismissal
of the indictment, but Walker refused to
give his name.
Chief of Police Devery was then recall
ed. He told Mr. Mazet that he took ex
ception to the old charges against him
brought up by Mr. Moss on Saturday be
ing admitted in evidence. Mr. Mazet
noted his exception. Then Devery ad
dressed the committee: â 
"I ask the protection of this committee
that Mr. Moss confine himself to any
question touching my administration a.
Chief of Police," said the Chief. "I am
here and stand ready to make an open
breast as to any question he may ask me
touching on the subject of the welfare of
the property-owner or as to any question
touching my administration since I havi:
been Chief of Police. I think his object in
entering into these matters in this case
is to go behind the stay of the court he
la an officer of, the Supreme Court, and I
his object is entirely foreign to this in
quiry."
The Chief hedged in his answers to
numerous questions. Again and again Mr.
Moss tried to get at the old charges when
Devery was a police captain, and again
and again Devery "did not remember."
"I don't remember now, I don't remem
ber. I can't remember," he reiterated.
"The records of the police headquarters
and the records of the court will show all
this." -_wg_
A long series of questions with hopeless
ly indefinite answers from Devery, fol
lowed. At last Mr. Moss got this one out
of him: . ,
"I never have demanded or received
any money or valuable thing for doing or
refraining from doing my duty, or any
part of my official duty, and I have never
received a dishonest dollar or demanded
one in my life. I defy anybody on that.
I am advised that any question touching
my personal affairs is not material or
proper or pertinent to this inquiry, and I
decline to answer by advice of counsel."
"That means you won't tell us what real
estate you own, what stocks you have, I
what money you have in bank, what prop
erty you have in general?" said Mr. Moss.
"Well, I don't mean that," said the '
Chief. "I am willing to let the public knew
anything, but 1 decline to answer any
questions touching on those matters you
refer to now."
"Now, Chief," said Mr. Moss, referring
to the old charges, "don't you know why ;
it was that with all that had occurred in !
the past which was unexplained, unde
nied, because you had no opportunity, as
you say, with all that had occurred in j
the past you should have been suddenly
jumped from a captaincy to the chief- j
taincy in three months? Why should that j
have been? Why was it so. How did it
occur?" -â¢'-â¢".".'-'â 'â '__
"Because I was a capable officer and
could fulfill the position and have got a
clean record in the police department,"
replied Devery.
Mr. Moss questioned the Chief closely
about his movements last night. Devery |
admitted that he had met Police Commis
sioner Sexton at his regular corner, where
on Saturday the Chief testified tha. he
nightly smoked a cigar before going to
bed. Then Mr. Moss brought out the fact
that Devery spent a good deal of time
last night in watching the alleged dis
orderly resort called the Broadway Oar
den, the former proprietor of which Is
said to be among the list of witnesses to
expose police methods.
"Are you going about and seeing the
people whom you see here to see i:" they
are going to appear against you?" de
manded Mr. Moss.
"I don't know," replied the Chief.
Mr. Moss asked why, even while the
committee was sitting In session here, the
pool rooms were running all around. He
stated that he had in his pocket money
that his investigators had won in the pool
rooms. Devery said his men were "look
ing after it." He added that if Mr. Moss
would make a specific complaint he
would have the men arrested. In answer
to the question why. with the money
and men at his command, he was unable
to close the pool rooms, Devery said he
did the best he could.
The Chief promised he would try to
stamp out pool rooms, policy shops and
"massage" establishments, to which Mr i
Moss drew his attention by referring to !
newspapers. Devery denied that he was â 
himself interested ln pool rooms or that !
there were men prominent in the city |
government who were connected with I
them.
"Did you ever hear of the time when
one man became interested in racing
horse, and on one little word from him
all the pool rooms in New York closed up
tight asked Mr. Ross.
''I never did," said Devery.
"And you cannot imagine .who that man
was, can you?" -:v rv
"No, sir."
"You never heard Mr. Croker's name
mentioned in connection with the tact?"
"No, sir."
"Suppose Mr. Croker should command
you to-day to close up all the pool rooms,
do you think It would be done?" de
manded Moss. Â« â¢
"He would not make any such . com
mands on me. I am here for the peopl*.
I told you," replied the Chief defiantly.
After some unimportant testimony from
a /policy shop keeper and a saloon l-.eper
as to dismissal of an Indictment, the
committee adjourned until Friday morn
ing at 10 o'clock.

WeeKly Call, $1.00EX-SENATOR TABOR'S
CAREER IS CLOSED
DENVER, April 10.â Hon. H. A. "W.
Tabor, postmaster of this city and
ex-United States Senator, died at
_:30 a. m. to-day of appendicitis,
after three days' Illness.
Horace A. W. Tabor was born in Vermont,
November 26, 1830. He learned the stonecutter' â¢
trade, at â  inch he worked until 25 years ot age.
He went west to K.ai.eas in -Â. . He was
elected a. member of the Kansas Legislature.
Attracted by the gold d.scovcries, he went to
Colorado, and in Uiiv engaged In placer mining
In I'ulilornia Gulch, now Ltradvllle.
Of Tabor's eariy life lutie is known. He was
always very reticent concerning it, and like bo
many otlv-rs, it practically begins when he
reached the mountains, In the tail of 1861. For
many years he followed the imps" of those
days". Golden, Black Hawk, Central City,
Brecklnrhige and Buckskin Joe. In these places
ho -i.d whatever came to hand, worked as a
teameier, miner and tor a tin kept a small
store. Hut in all these pieces his success "was
sm&ll. When the rich discoveries of Leadvllle
began to be known Tabor was postmaster at
Oru City, near Leadvllle. Resigning this, he
moved lo Leaiivllle and opened a restaurant.
Svhile hi? '.vile prepared the rather frugal
meals tor the rough miners who frequented the
place, Tabor talked mines and was constantly
lurnlzhing "grub stakes" for prospectors. In
.'.; ril, IS3B, lie iHted out two old prospectors
August i-.ic!:e and George F. Hook. One of
the most important parts of a. "grub stake"
In those days was whisky, nn& when Kiche and
Hook pot a few miles trom town they thought
. it wa? a:i Rood a place as any for drinking up
the liquor. The next morning the effect had
hardly w m off, but they began at once to sink
:t L"proepe<:t hole." They had gone but a short
. distance when thry struck a rich vein of ore.
Kcturr.iMT to .-her â was to share with
ih..-m in anything they should findâ he declared
; lhat It wi'f impossible to lind a good mine so
tear Leadville. The first wagon load brought
1215. In ninety day* the Little Plttsburi had
produced enough to enable Tabor to buy Hook's
chare for $50,000, and in six months niche's
'interest ivas purchased for $250,000.
For many months the mine paid $100,000 a t
ipjonth in dividends. Miners regarded It as sec
ond only In richness to the Comstock lode In
tsevada, which made the four big bonanzas of
the const. At this time he was said to have
the iarp^ft income of any man between New
â i'ork and t-'an Francisco.

â¢ from Orr.iiJ-.a to clerk In a bank and had be

'In -a bad light: He had seemingly sold stock

new officers in spite of his express stipulation I

BOSTONIANS FAIL
TO KEEP A DATE
Give Sacramentans the
Overlook.
Special Dl?ratch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 10.â G. "W.
Ficks, manager of the Clunie Opera
house, announced to-day that to
morrow he nould file a suit In San
Francisco against the B stonians for
51000 damages, which he alleges his
house has sustained at the hands of the
opera company. The Bostonians were
originally booked to appear in Sacra
mento on Maich 15, and Ficks an
nounced that fact in the newspapers
and made preparations for the operatic
event. After the Bostonians arrived in
Los Angeles from the East Ficks re
ceived a letter from them requesting
that the date be changed to March 11.
Ficks wrote back that he had already
contracted for the appearance of an
other attraction on that date and would
expect the singers to adhere to their
agreement to pear here on the Hth.
They did not appear and there was
much wailing and gnashing of teeth
among the playgoers of the town.
Ficks' countenance assumed an expres
sion counter to that which had accom
panied his extension of the glad hand
to the appreciative populace a few days
gone by and he had hard work "squar
ing himself' with the disappointed
patrons of his house. However, there
was some solace In the assurance that
the Bostonians would come here after
their S;m Francisco engagement and
play two nights instead of one. The
musical cult of the capital city found
quite a diversion in sending in sug
gestions to Manager Ficks as to what
operas the Bostonians should sing and
the prospects appeared to be quite
bright again.
Ficks announced to-day that it was
"all off," as far as any chance of the
appearance of the company here was
concerned, and that he was going to
-make the haughty, singers from the
effete East toe the chalkline. He says
he has as evidence the route list of the
company, issued prior to its departure
from the Kan, whereon appears the
booking of Sacramento for March 15.
Furthermore, he says, he can produce
certificates to show that all the mail
of the members of the company was
forwarded here in anticipation of the
appearance of the singers on March 15,
proving that _uch was the understand
ing of the correspondents^
Harder than the loss of the Boston-
Jans is the thought that C. P. Hall,
formerly manager of the old Metro
politan Theater In Sacramento, but now
manager of lan Jose's new theater,
contrived. to secure the date intended
for Sacramento in addition to the two
which he had previously booked. Man
ager Ficks says Hail has been trying
to "queer" the Sacramento theater by
telling the theatrical managers that
this is a poor show town, whereas, ac
cording to Ficks, it can be shown that
good companies have done more busi
ness here in one night than they have
done in one night each at Stockton and
San Jose combined; It is argued by the
local playgoers that Hall shouldn't say
hard things about the capital city, for
it was here thai he made his start.
HUNTINGTON BUYS LAND.
Hakes Another Extensive Purchase
at Galveston.
GALVESTON; Tex., April 10.â deed
for 11.3 acres of land at Virginia Point, on
the mainland opposite Galveston, from
Franz Kohfeldt to H. Bayard, was filed
for record to-day. The amount paid Is
$.7,?17. The property is taken for C. P.
Huntington and adjoins 2500 acres which
he bouÂ«lu several months ago. The land
nil fronts on the bay. What Mr. Hunt
ington Intends to do with ii is not known,
as hi; but recently bought 230 acres on the
Island for wharf purposes. New York
tpecials say It is for stockyards and pack
ers purposes.
lleved a new and beautiful helpmate was abso
lutely necessary' to his political and social suc
cess. Accordingly divorce proceeding, were in
stituted. Mrs. TaÃor filed a cross bill and
after a hard fought legal battle she was given
$100 000 cash and property ln Denver which waa
then thought to be .worth $400,000 more. Tabor
then built a magnificent home on what was
then called the terrace, which cost him $1,000,
--000. This was quickly followed by the build
ings on Seventeenth street and the Tabor Grand
Opera-house, which was a model of magnifi
cence ln Its day.
But misfortunes began to gather around him.
The touch which once transformed everything
Into gold seemed now to turn everything- Into
aj-hes. He lost $-,000,000 in a mining deal In
Southern Colorado, and property which he held
In Denver ceased to be productive, But still
he had several millions left.
The appointment of Senator Teller to a seat
In President Arthur's Cabinet left his seat- In
the Senate vacant, and Tabor at once began to
canvass for the place. The Legislature got in a
deadlock, which finally resulted in Tabor's
election. But he had only thirty days to serve.
It was during his term in the Senate that
Tabor was married to Miss Jennie Smith, head
milliner ln a large dry goods store in St. Louis.

WOULD GO IN QUEST
OF THE NORTH POLE
Captain Bernier Asks for the Assist
ance of the Ottawa Gov
" * ernment.
NEW TORK, April 10.-A special to the
Tribune from Ottawa, Ontario, says:
Captain J. E. Bernier of Quebec is here
to interview the members of the Govern
ment with the view of securing a grant of
$25,000 to enable him to organize his pro
posed expedition to the north pole. He
said that it would require fully $60,000 to
arrange for the expedition and If the Gov
ernment would grant the $25,000 asked for
he would find no difficulty in raising the
remainder by private subscriptions.
His plan at present is to leave Vancou
ver in May, 1900. He will follow the coast
of Siberia, pass through Bering Strait and
continue until he reaches the new Siberian
Islands. He will leave his vessel 200 miles
further east than where the Pram was
left, and with dogs and reindeer will trav
el over the pack ice until the pole is
reached. He will return by way of Dane
Island. in Spitzbergcn. The expedition,
Captain Hornier believes, will take about
two years.

muster rolls now held by the so-called
executive committee appointed by the
late military assembly by Its dissolution.
"With the rolls in their possession the
Americans will be in a position to push
forward energetically the work of distri
buting the 53,000,000 appropriated for the
Cuban army. - '- ,
THE SAN EKA^CISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1899.
Just previous to his marriage he called ln the
Washington correspondents and showed them
his night shirts, which he claimed cost $250
each. He had a magnificent coach made with
a coat of arms, and gave a swell wedding
breakfast at Willard' s which was attended al
most exclusively by men.
From this time on his financial descent was
rapid. A few years ago he was compelled to
call on a New York Insurance company for
aid, and then during the panic of 1593 he
placed a second mortgage on his property to
Mrs. Smith, who after paying off the first
mortgage foreclosed, leaving him stranded by
the ebb of the tide upon which ten years ago
he rode so proudly.
While disasters came not "singly but in bat
talions'' un Tabor, fate dealt Kindly with his
ex- wife. The property which she received ln
the divorce suit rapidly Increased In value
until she was the richest woman In the
State, She lived In a beautiful but rather

ROOSEVELT THE
GUEST OF HONOR
Chicago Gives Him an
Ovation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, April 10.â Seldom, if ever,
|in Chicago, has a more enthusiastic
i body of men met around the
. banquet table than the one which
i met to-night under the auspices of the
Hamilton Club to celebrate Appomat
tox day and to greet Governor Theo
dore Roosevelt of New York, who had
i come from Albany as the guest of
! honor of the club. The enthusiasm
; was extended ln generous measure to
j other speakers of the evening, but the
! greater part of it was given to the Gov
| ernor when he" rose to -make his ad-
I dress on "The Strenuous Life."
The hall was a maze of waving hand
kerchiefs and napkins and the cheers
j that greeted him as he rose prevented
j the speaker for many minutes from be
| ginning his speech. It was a greeting
| such as one man does not receive more
j than once or twice ln a lifetime. The
| boxes of the Auditorium, in which the
i banquet was held, as well as the seats
in the hall back of the banquet floor,
were filled with a large throng, who
had come to look on and to listen to the
speeches and these, as well bb the
members of the Hamilton Club and
their invited guests, joined in the wel
come that for a few minutes seemed to
overpower the Governor.
Fully 600 were around the banauet
tables where President Cody, who pre
sided, rapped for order, and ln a short
address introduced the guest of * the
evening.
As soon as Governor Roosevelt was
given a chance to talk he made a ring
ing address, upholding the administra
tion's policy, concluding as follows:
The army and the navy are the sword
and shield which this nation must carry
If she is to do her duty among the nations
of the earthâ lf she Is not to stand mÂ«Tely
as the China of the Western Hemisphere.
Our proper conduct toward the tropic
islands we have wrested from Spain Is
merely the form which our duty has
taken at the moment. ;â  .v.
When once we have put down armed
resistance, when once our rule is ac
knowledged, then an even more difficult
task will begin, for then we must see to
it that the islands are administered with
absolute honesty and with good Judg
ment. If we let the public service of the
islands be turned into the prey of the
spoils politician, we shall have begun to
tread the path which Spain trod to her
own destruction. We must send out there
only good and able men, chosen for their
fitness and not because of their partisan
service, and these men must not only ad
minister impartial Justice to the natives
and serve their own Government with
honesty and fidelity, but must show the
utmost tact and firmness, remembering
that with such people as those with whom
we are to deal weakness is the greatest
of crimes, and that next to weakness
comes lack of consideration for their
principles and prejudices. C: "
At . the conclusion of the banauet
Governor Roosevelt spent a short time
in his hotel and was then driven to the
Michigan Central De^ot, where he took
a train for Ann Arbor, where he is to
address the students of the Michigan
University to-morrow.

GUILT OF PETER
CASTRO PROVED
Mrs. Douglass' Assailant
Convicted.
VERDICT QUICKLY REACHED
PRISONER IDENTIFIED BY HIS
VICTIM.
Close of the First Case Growing Out
of the Brutal Attack Upon the
Wife of a Castroville
Citizen.
Special Dispatch to The CalL
' SALINAS, April 10.â Peter Castro
was to-day found guilty of burglary
in- connection with the brutal assault
upon Mrs. James L. Douglass at Cas
troville on the night of March 6.
Mrs. Agnes Douglass, the victim of
the assault, was the first witness. She
gave minute details of the outrage.
Some one knocked at the door of the
Douglass home and forcibly entered
the hallway. She recognized the man
as Peter Castro. He seized her and
dragged her out past the gate, on to
the road and toward the plaza en
trance, a distance of over fifty feet.
He there beat and kicked her until she
became unconscious. A rigid cross
examination by F. A. Treat, attorney
for the defense, only strengthened her
story. , ,
Mrs. D. W. McPhie, sister-in-law of J
Mrs. Douglass, corroborated her testi- j
mony. She told of having called for
help from the neighbors when Mrs.
Douglass was seized. Defendant, who
has lost much of his dark color and now
appears sallow, is apparently the most !
unconcerned person in the courtroom,
and does not appear to realize his posi- J
tion.
The prosecution Introduced other tes
timony to corroborate that of Mrs. \
Douglass. James L. Douglass, the hus- j
band of the victim, said his wife in- |
formed him early the next morning of
the outrage. He sought out Castro and I
asked why he had been to his house.
Castro had denied knowledge of the af
fair and asked for mercy, saying he had I
been on a drunk.
Castro's llight and capture were de
scribed, after which tne prosecution
rested.
The defense called several members
of the so-called Mafia gang, but their
testimony did not show the where
abouts of the accused after 10:30 o'clock
that night, and it was apparent from
their actions that they were trying to
shield him.
Castro was called to the stand and
testified as to his movements on the
night of the outrage. He became con
fused and contradicted himself. He
could give no reason for his flight. His
story was a general denial of all the
testimony of the prosecution.
One of the witnesses for the accused,
Miss Josie Collins, gave startling testi
mony, which was made use of by the
District Attorney. She said when Cas
tro came to her brother's house for a
horse he said some one had dragged
Mrs. Douglass, out of her house' the
night before and beaten her, and that
her husband, "Jim" Douglass, was not
at home at the time.
The case was given to the Jury at 4:30
o'clock. It returned to the courtroom
in fifteen minutes with a verdict of
guilty. Castro, as soon as the verdict
was read, began to shake and tremble
as though with ague, and seemed for
the first time to realize his position.
Upon being removed to the Sheriff's
office his mother, sisters and brother
were found waiting for him. A long
and tearful. conference was held, which
is believed may lead to further arrests.
CARDINAL DEFEATED
BY MOUNTAIN GIRLS
Nevada University "Co-Eds" Win the
Basket-Bail Game on Stanford
Campus.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 10.â
After two years of planning and waiting
j for an outside game, the fair athletes of
j Stanford were defeated this afternoon in
j their contest with the "Co-eds" from the
University of Nevada by a score of 3 to 2.
The came was close and , Interesting
throughout and so good was the interfer
ence that neither side was able to score
ui.wi tne second half. Toward the middle
of this half Nevada gained a decided ad
vantage by Miss Llnscott's successful
field goal. With two points to their credit
Miss Strosnelder tried for goal by a free
throw and put the ball Into the basket.
The Stanford girls then rallied and a
pretty field goal by Captain Tucker saved
the Cardinal from a whitewashing.
Probably the prettiest play of the day
was one that did not count, me ball
was sent fairly into the basket by Miss
Tucker from the 30-foot line. It was a
beautiful throw, but the umpire's whis
tle had sounded to remove an Injured
player of Cardinal who had been hurt
in a preceding scrimmage, and so there
was no score. ;?:-..:
Not since the final football practice
have there been so many spectators at
an athletic contest on the campus. The
bleachers were crowded and the sides of
the field were lined with men and women.
There was lots of "rooting" and the girls
yelled vlclferously. They were not so im
partial, however, as the boys, who alter
nated the Stanford with the Nevada yell,
which was deemed by some to be not al
together patriotic, even though it were
chivalrous. :-
In the hour and a half of game there
were many hard falls and scrimmages.
There was no unnecessary roughness,
however. Everything was done In a
business-like way. In fact, much of the
play was pantomime in character, as
the Nevada players outplayed the home
aggregation. Their passing was quiet
and sure and their plays were well
worked out. The Stanford girls relied
more on individual play, which resulted
in keeping them busy in defending their
own goal, allowing them fewer chances
for offensive work. The team lined up as
follows:
Nevadaâ Ward, captain, right guard;
Ethel Sparks, left guard; Frances Kerhy, cen
ter; Stella Llnscott, home; Winifred Stros
netder, right forward; Bernlce Worland, â -: left
forward; Ethel Peckham, center guard.
Stanfordâ Tucker, captain, center;
Emily Dole, stationary center: Tillle Swhnson,
forward center; Yrene Pitcher, left guard;
Elizabeth Lewis. right guard; Margaret
Phelps, left . forward ; Winifred Morgan, right
forward.
The officials were: Umpire. Louise Linscott;
referee, Mayme Merritt; timekeepers, Maud
March and Mary Oilman.

HEARD ARMOUR'S
AGENT ADMIT THE
USE OF CHEMICALS
__ â¢ __ ___ __ #
Dp. Castle Gives Some Telling
Testimony Concerning the
"Embalmed" Beef.
WASHINGTON, April 10.â The army
beef inquiry court resumed its sessions
at 10 o'clock to-day with Rear Admiral
John G. Walker, president of the Nlc
araguan canal commission, on the
stand. He said that canned roast beef
had been used by the commission's
surveying parties on the isthmus. The
men did not like this beef, preferred
bacon and the fresh native beef; but it
had not been found unwholesome. If
outfitting a large expedition to the
tropics he would include some of the
canned beef as a ration, but not very
much.
Dr. Charles H. Castle, an assistant sur
geon of the First Ohio Cavalry, for a
time brigade surgeon, and one of the men
whose names were given by Lieutenant
Gampfer a_ being present at Lakeland,
Fla. , when Mr. Morehouse, agent for
Armour & Co., said that their beef had
been chemically treated, said that on two
occasions he had found the meat spoiled
after It had passed inspection. On the
18th of August he had met the Armour
agent, whose name he did not know, In
the presence of Captain Carmichael and
Lieutenant Gampfer at the commissary
depot. Dr. Castle called the attention of
the agent to some discoloratlons of a
greenish character on the meat. The
agent replied: "The discoloration Is due
to some chemical with which the beef was
treated upon being put In the refriger
ator."
"I asked him what the formula was,"
continued Dr. Castle, "but he replied that
he did not know."
Dr. Castle identified a letter he had ad
dressed to the chief commissary at Tam
pa on the 23d of August last, asking that
he be allowed to purchase beef at Lake
land, and not be compelled to receive beef
shipped in, because of the frequent con
demnations of the refrigerator beef at
Tampa. Falling to receive a prompt re
sponse, he had wired and received author
ity for a time to make the purchases of
local butchers.
Describing the odor emitted by the meat,
Dr. Castle said It was not of a disgusting
character, but that It was an aromatic,
acrid, sour smell. He had reached the
conclusion since he returned to his labor
atory work in Cincinnati that the beef
had been treated either' with the gas
formaldehyde or the kindred solution,
formalin. He had made no recommenda
tion to any superior officer concerning the
agent's statement because he had sup
posed that the War Department knew of
the process, if any was used.
CYCLIST RONS
OVER A COUGAR
Strange Tale of a Wash-
ington Man.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA. April 10.â Eby, an en
â¢ gineer at Rock Quarry, near Vancou
ver, Wash., lives about a mile from the
j scene of his daily labor, going to work
I each morning before daylight and re
j turning again at night on his bicycle.
I One morning last week he was bowl
! ing at a fast pace when he came sud
denly upon a large mountain lion ly-
I Ing asleep ln the pathway. Neither
; heard the other until it was too late to
; avert a collision. The bicyclist rode
j over the big creature's foot, which dis
i turbed Eby's equilibrium and he was
about to fall from his wheel, when, ac
| cording to his own story, he was mi
i raculously righted by a stroke from the
animal's paw. The blow was of just
; sufficient force, Eby claims, to place
him again In an upright position on his
wheel ready for scorching, and as the
incentive was not lacklne-. he flew. He
would not even look back to see how
the cougar took the encounter.
On reaching home he found that both
his shirts were torn through at the
sleeve and other evidences of the truth
of his story is revealed in four bloody
scratches, where the claws of the cou
gar had stripped his skin.
Friends and neighbors of Eby believe
his story to be a truthful narrative of
an encounter that was both novel and
thrilling. For some time it has been
known that cougars existed in the lo
cality and they frequently have been
seen. Only a couple of weeks ago Mr.
Reese, a neighbor of Ehv, saw one just
outside his garden fence. An effort fs
being made by the neighbors to hunt
them and kill them. One settler has a
number of hounds and these will be
employed in seeking their lair. -
LOS ANGELES' SOLID
SIX DEFEATS EATON
LOS ANGELES, April 10.â Mayor
Eaton's veto of the amended ordinance
extending the limits of the oil-boring
area in the West Lake and Sunset Park
districts was presented to the Council to
day. Not a speech was made, not a word
of comment in Its favor uttered, and
when it came to a vote the solid six that
sustained the original ; ordinance disre
garded the Mayor's protest and passed
the measure over his head. The terms of
the ordinance 'remove the deadline and
contract the proscribed district, render
ing It lawful to bore for oil in the Nob
Hill neighborhood. This favors the
Huntington streetcar system and permits
it to sink as many oil wells as it can find
accommodation for on - the Kofoed tract
that was secured by option several weeks
ago.

Sidney Reid, a reporter in the New |
York office of the Associated Press, gave
the particulars of an interview he had
with General Miles at the Waldorf-Astoria
on the 31st of January last. In this inter
view General Miles was represented as
telling of the inquiries he had set afoot '
concerning the beef supplied to the army,
as saying that the canned roast beef was
nothing more than the refuse of beef from'
which beef extract had been made, and as
stating that he had overwhelming cvi- |
dence that the embalmed beef was treated
with chemicals. '
Mr. Reid presented the court with a cor
rect copy of the interview as prepared by !
him. Referring to an interview with Gen
eral Miles printed in the New York Her
ald Mr. Reid said it was not a correct
reproduction of the Miles interview. "I j
saw portions of my interview in the Her
ald," he said, "combined with other mat
ter which I did not write."
In reply to questions from Major Lee
Mr. Reid said he did not have General :
Miles' .testimony before the war Investi
gating commission in mind when he
talked with him or when he wrote his ar
ticle. His conversation with General Miles
had occurred In the office of the hotel
and the latter at first declined to be in- '
terviewed, excusing himself several times.
Upon a later attempt on his part General I
Miles had consented to read what pur- I
ported to be Interviews with him in the j
New York evening papers of that date l
and had then expressed himself as rep- !
resented in the Associated Press dis
patches.
Mr. Reid said that General Miles knew j
he represented the Associated Press and
that he was taking notes. On the way
to his office he had compared his mem- i
orandum with that made by the reporter
of the New York Times, who was pres
ent at the time, and found they agreed \
substantially.
"I don't claim that the verbiage Is ab- !
solutely correct," he said, "but I do claim i
that It Is correct in substance and that It '
does not misrepresent what General Miles ;
said."
Moreover, he had volunteered to sub- i
mit the interview to General Miles when
written out, but the general had said j
that he was too busy to give attention to !
It, or had made some other excuse; con- !
sequently the general had not seen the I
article after it was prepared. The court !
then adjourned for the day.
General Shafter will give his testlmonv
to-morrow. He said to-night that he j
would probably remln In Washington j
only a few days, as he preferred to be ln '
San Francisco, where the work of trans- I
porting the troops is being accomplished. |
He said that he did not feel that his
presence there was required, but he pre- I
ferred to go back as soon as possible.
VAST TRACT LOST
TO THE RAILWAY
Decision in the Overlap
Land Case.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 10.â An opinion
I favoring the plaintiff in the case of the
United States vs. the Southern Pacific
Railroad Company was handed down
by Judge Ross of the United States
District Court to-day. The net result
of the decision is to give to the Govern
ment nearly 610,000 acres of land which
has heretofore been held and claimed
by the railroad company.
The United States originally brought
three suits against the Southern Pa*fic I
Railroad Company to determine title \
to the odd-numbered sections of land
within the twenty and thirty mile limits
of the grant made by the United States
to the Southern Pacific Railroad Com
pany through an act of Congress in
March, 1871. The disputed land was \
situated within twenty miles of the
general route of the Texas Pacific Rail
road. The three suits were combined.
In rendering his opinion the Judge
determined that the Texas Pacific Rail- j
road had made a valid location of its
general route and all lands within the !
twenty-mile limit of that line, amount- '
ing to 610,000 acres, were excepted from
the Southern Pacific grants, and the
Government was entitled to a decree
against the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company for those lands.
It was further decided that the at
tempted location of the Texas Pacific
Railroad Company from Yuma to San
Diego via San Gorgonio Pass was not
authorized by act of Congress, as a
definite location had never been com
pleted; that lands falling within the
limit of that route and outside of those
of the direct route of the Texas Pacific
were granted to the Southern Pacific
Company and that that company is
entitled to a decree for those lands.
The court also held that the Colorado
River Irrigation Company was a bona
fide purchaser of 5000 acres of land er
roneously patented to the Southern Pa
cific Railroad Company.

Shall Berkeley license saloons
No.
BERKELEY, April 10.â The residents of
the university town turned out in full
force to-day for one of the most closely
contested elections Berkeley has known.
Shortly before 5 a. m. the polls opened
nnd a continuous stream of voters kept
the clerks and judges busy until 6 o'clock
this evening. It was nearly 11 o'clock be
fore the final result became known.
On the whole the election passed oft
very quietly. The business men In gen
eral showed their Interest In the extreme
by voting In large number* before taking
the morning trains to the city. Early in
the day the anti-saloon element put in
an appearance, sparing at effort to fur
ther its cause. The saloon-keepers were
not slow in beginning the fight, and a live
ly little contest between the two formed
the principal center of interest at the
several polling places.
As predicted li The Call yesterday, the
city has startled itself by voting to abol
ish saloons within Its corporate limits.
The majority vote on this issue leaves
little doubt as to the sentiment of the
community. It is emphatically against
the saloon-keepers and they will see In
a balance of about 300 votes gainst them
their warrant to shut up shop and ply
their traffic elsewhere. * "
The anti-saloonlsts, without allying
themselves with any party platform or
with any particular candidates, made the
issue one of moral principle, and asked
for votes on that ground aione, irrespect
ive of party or factional affiliations. Their
appeal was not in vain. Joining forces,
the Woman's Christian Temperance
Union, and the Anti-Saloon League of
California, assisted by the local churches
conducted a campaign which lacked noth
ing in energy or sound judgment. They
Hooded the city with their campaign lit
erature, they held meeting after meeting
in all the public halls and they worked
like politicians at the polls. Every man
who came to cast his ballot was met
by one of the women stationed at the
noils and presented with a ticket asking
him to vol against saloons. The vote
is a:. eloquent guarantee of the efficiency
of their canvass.
Just what attitude the new Board of
Trustees will take toward this matter re
main-. to be seen. It knows full well what
the feeling of the residents of the ; -; L> . is
and doubtless will act accordingly by vot
ing to not renew any of the saloon li
censes as soon as the present quarter ex
pires.
Next to the saloon question, the fight
for Town Marshal absorbed most of the
interest. For a while it seemed as though
Stewart would carry the day, as his vote
in the Second nnd Third wards exceeded
that of his opponent. But Lloyd, the in
cumbent, forged ahead in North and
West Berkeley, carrying the day with a
lair majority.
The closest contest was ween Tur
-3.1. _- n^- M i ?rrlll for Trustee from the
Third ward, the count ending with a
very small majority for Turner. Major
Jansen in tho Fifth Ward ran his op
ponent Staats very closely for Trustee
but failed by a narrow margin. Little in
the Third Ward ran far ahead of Dr
Semper for School Director.

at the door continued the fire, and _te_

he remained behind the counter, made a
desperate dash from his cover to a stair
way in the rear of the store. He fell
pierced by six bullets before he had gone
ten feet. One of the bullets had gone
through his neck, another through his
back and the other wounds were of a
minor nature. The fighting stopped In
stantly and Deputy Chaffee ran to the
wounded negro and placed him under ar-

Stevens Is a negro of robust build, big i
and brawny. The -hock of his numerous
wounds did not apparently hurt him, for
he swore and said to the deputy, li
surrender " and, with blood pouring down
his clothing, walked with his captor to j
a physician's office, where he waa given
medical attendance. He was then taken |
to jail. , , 'V _
Meanwhile the riot was raging in the
street. As soon as the first shots had been
fired 'th.- whistle of the electric light
plant was Mow:, as a signal for the citi
zens, the majority of whom had long be- i
fore been sworn as deputies to turn out
armed and ready to fight. At the same
time the miners of the Tana and Penwell ;
mines which are located about four j
blocks distant from the Penwell store, <
which is the center of the town, rushed |
into the tipples and opened tire on the ,
thronged streets, the news that Stevens,
one of their number, had been shot and
arrested, aiouslng them to a pitch of rury.
They shot at any living mark in sight, j
ard*as a result among their victims are
three women. Two of them are white
women, wounded, and one negro woman,
Frank Landsworth is a grocer's delivery
boy. He was delivering goods near the
Penwell mine and was wounded in the (

Harrison Hotel, was shot in the side by a ;
bullet that entered the kitchen window
from the Pana mine. Albert \ ickers was
wounded while standing on the Big Four

The unknown negro men were killed in

also killed in this district. Mrs. Henriot
was wounded while in her dooryard near

Frank Colburn, the local agent for a
brewing company, was standing in the
door of his bottling house, near the Pen

Penwell tipple killed him.
The report la general to-night that sev
eral miners ane dead and dying in the
fields near mine No. 2, near the Pana
Company, having been killed by stray
bullets, but owing to darkness it is im
possible to ascertain the facts regarding
the report.
This impression Is given credence also
by the fact that a dead negro miner was
found after nightfall in the road near
shaft No. 2. The firing in that vicinity
was general and it is probable that a
search in the morning will result in other
bodies being found. . â  .
Coroner Bradley arrived from Taylor

inquest will be held to-morrow over the
body of Frank Coburn. who Is the son of

the names of the five dead negroes.

arrested every Deputy Sheriff, including .
Chief Deputy Cheney, all of whom were;
disarmed and then released. Chief of i
Police "William Kiely was also arrested ;

GEORGIA WOODS' INJURIES
WILL BE EXAMINED
Doctors Appointed to Ascertain the
Effects of the Beating Adminis
tered by Treadwell.
SAN JOSE, April 10.â A physical exami
nation of Georgia Woods, the woman who
is suing James H. Treadwell, the young
capitalist, for $25,000 for injuries he In
flicted by beating her, was ordered this
afternoon by Judge Kittredge of the Su
perior Court. Drs. I. N. Frasse. Elvira
Clement and Elizabeth Galllmore, the
latter two women, were appointed to
make the examination of the plaintiff
before the 25th of April.
'1 readwell gave the Woods woman an
unmerciful beating, and after knocking
her down jumped on her head with his
feet. She was confined to her bed for a
couple of weeks. Besides being made de
fendant ln a damage suit Treadwell has
been charged with Intent to commit mur
der. Ills attorneys claim the woman Is
shamming and took to her bed in order
to "bleed" their client. The case, which
will be very sensational, will be stub
bornly contested. â ]

PRAY WHILE BATTLE
OF BALLOTS RAGES
Pomona ProhibitioQists Fast on
Election Day and Defeat
the Saloons.
POMONA, April 10.â A city campaign on the distinct Issue of "sa
loon or no Baloon" came to an end in the biennial election to-day.
Never before has there been such a canvass in Pomona Valley. For
five weeks the all-absorbing question has been whether to license sa
loons here each at $1000 a year or banish them from the city. To-day
there were all-day prayer meetings and fnstings at the churches in sup
plication to God to direct the voters to vote for the prohibition of the
liquor traffic ln Pomona. Men and women Joined ln song and prayer
and never desisted until the polls closed to-night. The high license party
was confident of success. Many had not the least idea the saloon Is
sue could be defeated, but the count of the ballots shows that the
Prohibitionists have won by over 100 majority. Pomona's two sa
loons will now have to quit business.
FIGHT FOLLOWS
FRESNO ELECTION
William McSwain Hits
Charles Joslin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, April There was only one
disgraceful Incident connected with tho
city election to-day. After the close of
the' polls William McSwain, a prominent
Democratic ward politician, struck
Charles Joslin. The injured man Is now
at the County Hospital and It Is feared
he will not recover. McSwain has not
yet been arrested. .
The cause of the fight was a remark
made by McSwain. The politician was
engaged in conversation with Lee Wof
ford and made a slurring remark which
Joslin thought applied to himself or to
one of his friends. Joslin called McSwain
to account and McSwain knocked him
down. McSwain then started down the
street. As soon as Joslin regained his
feet he started after him.
The men met in front of the Universal
Restaurant on I street. As soon as Joslin
walked up McSwain turned and struck
him in the face. The blow staggered Jos
lin and he fell. Ills head struck the side
walk with a thud. He was picked up in
an unconscious condition and taken to
the County Hospital. Dr. Davidson ex
amined the man's head, but could not
ascertain whether the skull had been
fractured, though from the nature of the
wound It appeared to be.
McSwain claims that after being
knocked down the first time Joslin made
a threatening pass as though to draw a
knife and that he knocked him down the
second time in self-defense. After strik
ing Joslin McSwain disappeared and could
not be found. He Was seen to enter the
Universal restaurant, but probably made
his exit through the rear door. It is
thought both McSwain and Joslin were
under the influence of liquor. A dirk was
afterward found near the scene. This
M Swain's friends claim fell from Jos
lln's pocket. .
With the exception of this fight, the
election passed off without incident worthy
of mention. The counting of the ballots
Is progressing slowly, but enough is
known to make certain the election of the
following candidates, the majorities rang
ing from 10 to 200: , -^.
City Clerkâ James B. Johnson (D.).
Attorneyâ Frank Laning (D.).
Assessorâ J. M. Collins (R.).
Marshalâ D. Morgan (D.).
Treasurerâ C. H. Swett (R.).

Members of the Board of Educationâ J.
W. Gearhart (R.) and O. M. Thompson
City Trusteesâ J. C. Moore (RO. H. C.
Tupner (D.) and Taylor Albln (D.).
A Non-Partisan Board of Library Trus
tees was elected and also a Non-Partisan
board of fifteen freeholders who will have
ln charge the framing of a new city char
ter. Both the Democratic and Republi
can conventions indorsed the candidates
for Library Trustees and members of the
Board of Freeholders, and there was no
contest for these offices.

ELECTION STRIFE
AT SAN RAFAEL
Frequent Persona! En
counters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April 10.â The municipal
election to-day developed the most bitter
contest ever known in San Rafaelâ a fight
In which political and partisan Issues were
entirely lost eight of, owing to an attack
mode out of religious motives on a candi
date for the office of School Trustee by a
county official. So keenly was this as
sault deplored by the people generally
that prominent citizens of all religious
and political bodies arrayed themselves
around the standard of the candidate in
question and battled so vigorously In his
behalf that he polled an enormous vote.
At a late hour the count showed him to
bo so far ln the lead that his election is
regarded as a certainty. Personal en
counters during the day were numerous,
and on two occasions the cause of the
heated feeling narrowly escaped injury
at the hands of citizens. This evening he
was not in evidence on the streets at all.
Ten days before the election the Social
ist Labor party placed several candidates
ln the field and caused some active dis
cussion, but a day or two later County
Superintendent of Schools Robert Furlong
buried all other issues by making a vigor
ous canvass against P. F. Cochrane, a
candidate for School Trustee, because of
the latter's religious belief. Furlong even
went so far as to try to persuade another
candidate to withdraw from the contest
in order to encompass Cochrane's defeat.
The most prominent citizens of the com
munity, irrespective of religious affilia
tion, plunged into the fray and made
Cochrane's fight ln so aggressive a style
that he "won in a walk."
While the excitement was at the high
est pitch this morning and voters were
being brought to the polls in all kinds of
vehicles, a San Francisco contractor
named A. J. Chisholm met Furlong on the
street and shook his first under the of
fending official's nose, accompanying the
act with some language of a violent char
acter. Furlong avoided an encounter by
hurrying away from the spot. Later _
candidate of the religious belief opposed
by Furlong handed the School Superin
tendent his card, the scene being wit
nessed by Michael Cochrane, the aged
father of the candidate for School Trus
tee.
"Don't you know better than to ask a
man to vote for you who would cut your
throat if he da"red!" yelled the old man.
as he rushed forward with upraised can..
"Get out of here quick!"â this to Furlong,
and the latter stood not on the order.
The candidates practically assured of
election by the vote counted at a late
hour are as follows:
School Trusteesâ P. F. Cochrane, I_ F.
Dunand and Thomas Hansen.
Town Trusteesâ Henry Eckhoff, Henry
Schlosser and Henry Gleske.
Marshalâ Healey.
Treasurerâ Scott.
Assessorâ W. F. Dougherty.
City Attorneyâ P. Boyd.
Clerkâ John T. Buslln.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALAMEDA, April- 10.â election to
-iiy resulted ln a victory for the Municipal
I-cagTie. It elected two of Its candidates
members of the Board of City Trustees,
all of its candidates for the Board of Edu
cation and City Attorney and City As-
BeÃHor. Harmonle Hall elected one mem
ber of the Board of City Trustees, John
Conrad, Independent candidate for City
Marshal , won by a vote exceeding
the combined vote of Gunn and MacÃae,
Roswell G. Wheeler, also an Independent,
defeated Lubbock and Johnson for the
office of City Treasurer. The successful
candidates are as follows:
Members of the Board of Trustees J
oseph F. FOrderer, Municipal League;
Alexander Mackie, Harmonic Hall; George
R. Miller, Municipal League.
Members of the Board of Educationâ
E. M. Keys, Frank Otis and J. R. Sloan,
all Municipal League nominees.
City Clerkâ Ben F. Lamborn (no oppo
sition).
City Attorneyâ E. K. Taylor (Municipal
League).
City Assessorâ Minor Smith (Munici
pal League).
City Recorderâ F. St. Sure (no oppo
sition).
City Marshalâ John Conrad (independ
ent).
City Treasurerâ G. Wheeler (in
dependent).
Library Trusteesâ P. W. Barton (Har
monic Hall), E. W. Maslin (Municipal
League), William M. Bowers (Harmonic
Hall).
A large vote was polled and unusual In
terest taken. The total vote was 2517, as
compared with 2136 at the election two
years ago. There were no disturbances of
any kind during the day and no arrests
were made. The forces of the Municipal
League were well organized and ably
handled, while the Harmonic Hall people
lacked unity of action. The Young Men's
Republican Club, which took an active
part ln the campaign, cut no figure in the
election on the face of the returns.
The principal fight was for control of
the Board of Education. Early in the cam
paign the Municipal League trained Its
guns on Trustees J. B. Lanktree and C. L.
Tlsdale. who were candidates for re-elec
tion, charging that the gentlemen were
using the department, In connection with
Superintendent Sullivan, as a political
machine. The controversy led to the cele
brated telephone Interview between B. C.
Brown, author of the Municipal League
charges, and Trustee Tlsdale. Lanktree
and Tisdale made desperate efforts to se
cure re-election, calling to their assistance
County Clerk Jordan and many Oakland
politicians. The result of to-day's ballot
ing, however, was their complete down
fall. This means that Superintendent Sul
livan's official head will fall in the basket.
The outcome of the Marshalship and
Treasurer's fight was a surprise. The
poor showing of Gunn, the Harmonic can
didate and MacÃae, the nominee of the
Municipal League, cannot be accounted
for in any other way than that it was due
to the extreme popularity of John Con
rad, who has been connected with the
police force for thirteen years and was
appointed to succeed Marshal Rogers
when the latter was elected Sheriff.
Strange as it may appear, while Har
monic Hall lost to-day's election it has
gained control of the Board of City Trus
tees by the victory of Alexander Mackie.
Trustees Schulte and Brick, holdovers,
were elected by Harmonic Hall two years
ago. and by the addition of Mackie the
party will have a majority of one vote in
the board. Forderer, who is re-elected,
will lose the chairmanship and will prob
ably be succeeded in that position by
Brick.
The total vote received by all the candi
dates follows:
City Trustees Albert Arents 961, Joseph F.

SALOON PROPRIETORS
APPEAL THEIR CASES
LOS ANGELES, April 10.â The victims
of the city liquor laws who have been
adjudged guilty of alleged violations un
der city ordinances will seek a higher
tribunal for redress. A determined at
tack was this morning made in the Su
perior Court on the proceedings whereby
several saloon-keepers and employes were
fined for alleged violations of the mid
night and Sunday closing ordinance. The
attorneys for the defendants appeared
before Judge Smith and said they were
prepared to argue on two propositionsâ
First, a motion to dismiss on the ground
that . the ordinance upon which convic
tions had been obtained was Invalid be
cause an old ordinance had been super
seded by the new ordinance; second, on
a motion for a new trial, as the Police
Judge who heard the original trials had
refused the defendants the privilege of a
jury trial.
The attorneys are divided on the right
of a Police Judge to refuse a jury trial
to persons accused of having violated
city ordinances, but admit the defendant
has the right to such demand under an
infraction of the State laws.
This attempt to test the laws and ordi
nances is regarded as a determined ef
fort to bring to a head all legislation
affecting the rights of liquor dealers and
is fraught with more importance than
these preliminaries now reveal, as all of
the alleged violators of the Sunday ordi
nance who were arrested during the re
cent upheaval have taken similar posi
tions.
Schooner's Mate Drowned.
PORTLAND, Or., April 10.â Charles
Ross of San Francisco, first officer of the
schooner Prosper, was drowned in the
Willamette River this afternoon. He was
superintending the loading of his vessel
with lumber when he slipped and fell
overboard. He sank Immediately and the
body could not be found.
SUPERVISORS
MUST BE HELD
RESPONSIBLE
To Legalize Sparring
Exhibitions.
CITY ATTORNEY'S OPINION
PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE
NEW LAW.
Legal Requirements as to the Pay
ment of an Annual License
Fee Is the Pertinent
Point.
The popular belief that the law paused
by the last Legislature relative to spar
ring exhibltons has the effect of legalizing
what has heretofore been Illegal was ex
ploded yesterday by City and County At
torney Lane in a formal opinion given the
Board of Supervisors.
The statement in brief Is that the new
law simply makes a provision authorizing
Boards of Supervisors to impose certain
conditions which, If complied with, will
make the giving of sparring exhibitions
legal. If the conditions are not complied
with, or if they are not Imposed, then the
participants stand in the same position as
regards the new law as they did under the
former statute. In other words, to use a
sporting term, the Legislature has
"passed the buck" to the Boards of Su
pervisors of the various counties, and It
now lies with the local legislative bodies
to act and thus become responsible for
what is done in the prize ring.
The new law follows the language of
the old statute and makes all persons who
participate in, instigate or encourage a
prize fight or sparring exhibition guilty
of a felony. To this Is added the follow
ing proviso:
Provided, however, that- sparring exhibi
tions, not to exceed a limited number of
rounds, with gloves of not less than five
ounces each ln weight, may be held by a
domestic incorporated - club upon the pre
payment by such club of an annual license
to be fixed by the Supervisors of each
county.
It follows that if the Supervisors do not |
fix an annual license fee, or having fixed !
it it is not paid, then the persons engaging i
ln or promoting a sparring exhibition are
to be held guilty of a felony.
City and County Attorney Lane holds
that the Board of Supervisors is not nec
essarily required to fix an annual license
fee and thereby give promoters of spar
ring exhibitions an opportunity to legalize
what is otherwise held to be Illegal. Re
plying to a query put by the board he
says:
You ask further If you "must Impose an
annual license upon incorporated athletic
clubs proposing to hold boxing contests or
exhibitions." The statute provides that
(pairing exhibitions may be held by cer
tain clubs "upon the prepayment by such
club of an annual license to be fixed by
the Supervisors of each county." There Is
in this language no direction positive and
explicit requiring the Board of Supervisors
to fix a license for sparring exhibitions in
each county. There is not even an implica
tion that each county must necessarily fix
6uch a license. The act Is an amendment
to the Penal Code. It does not purport to
do more than define a certain crime. If it
did the proviso would not have been ger
mane and relevant to the enacting clause.
It does not say to the Board of Super
visors of Siskiyou County or Inyo County
"You must fix a license for Incorporated
athletic clubs giving- sparring exhibitions."
But It does say that If one now participates
ln a sparring exhibition given by an Incor
porated athletic club which has paid the
license fee affixed therefor by the Board of
Supervisors he Is no longer guilty of a
felony. And if the Board of Supervisors
does license sparring exhibitions of the kind
herein considered it will now be acting
within the law. But the statute does not
compel the board to fix an annual or any
license fee.
Further, the board may within its com
prehensive police powers as a municipal
legislative body Impose other conditions
than those set forth in the statute upon
such exhibitions. But such conditions
should be Imposed by general order or reso
lution applying to all such exhibitions and
must not conflict with the conditions Im
posed by statute. If a license Is fixed It
must be reasonable, as must be all other
regulations Imposed.
At their meeting- yesterday the Su
pervisors discussed the question of ex
acting a yearly license of $5000 for the
privilege of promoting boxing here. The
matter was referred to the Health and
Police Committee for further investiga
tion. A permit was granted Washington
Square Athletic Club for a meeting on
the 13th inst. The application of the Ex
celsior Club was laid over until the
Health and Police Committee reports.
SEARCH FOR MOORE
IN BUTTE COUNTY
CHICO, April 10.â A posse of officers has
been out all day searching this vicinity
for Ed Moore, the murderer of Officer
Kilroy of Nevada City. A man closely

here, and the fact that the murderer has
relatives here and was at one time a resi
dent of Chico adds to the belief that he
Is in hiding near this city. Sheriff Get

Trend of Testimony at
His Court-Martial.
MAJOR EDIE CALLED FIRST
BOOKS NOT KEPT. BUT PAPERS
ALL SEEMED RIGHT.
Accused Suffered From the Effects of
Grip and Would Not Have Acted
as He Did Had He Been
Well.
The trial of Lieutenant John M. Neall
was commenced in earnest yesterday
morning*. The charges against him were
read and he pleaded to them, and tho ex
amination of the first witness. Major Guy
L. Edie. was nearly completed.
The accused pleaded not guilty to all of
the charges and specifications except to
the first charge and its first specification
and to the first specification of the second
charge. His plea to the first charge and
specification was a qualified one, however,
for he pleaded guilty only to the specifica
tion as altered by himself. The first
charge was absence without leave; the
first specification of the charge was that
he had wrongfully absented himself from
1 p. m. of February 15. 1539, to 10 a. m.
March 19, 1599. This he pleaded guilty to
as of from 7 a. m. February 16 to 10 p. m.
March IS. The other charges, contrary to
expectations, included all the matters of
company, exchange and club shortages al
leged against him from the first of the
trouble, and also two cases of deception
which were not known before. He was
asked by tho adjutant, Lieutenant Har
ris, why he did not turn over the ac
counts of the post exchange in conformity
with the orders he had received, and he
told Harris he could not do so until he had
had indorsed by the administratrix of the
lato Captain Nolan certain checks made
ravable to Lieutenant Nolan when he was
in "charge of the exchange. This statement
- . This statement
was faise. the specification allege., and
was made for the purpose of deceiving
the adjutant. The same statement waa
also made to the quartermaster, Lieuten
ant T. H. Siavens, and upon that a sec
ond specification Is based. Ho is also ac
cused of conduct unbecoming an officer
and a gentleman, the specifications being
that he left his wife and family without
means of support, that he did not pay
his bills, and that he deceived his brother
officers. The four charges In brief are:
Absence without leave; absence from
guard mount; induct prejudicial to good
order and military discipline; conduct un
becoming and officer and a gentleman.
The second charge Is based on the fact
that on the day he disappeared he had
been ordered to duty as officer of the day
and as such had charge of the guard.
Major Edie, brigade surgeon and in
charge of the medical department of the
post, was the first witness called. He
said he had been called to see Mrs. Neall
the day after Neall had disappeared. She
told him Neall had never been away be
fore and she was afraid there was some
thing wrong with htm. She said he had
been acting peculiarly for some time and
she was much worried over his absence.
The next day Major Edie called on Mrs.
Neal! again, and as her husband had not
appeared he asked her if she was In need
of financial assistance. She said she had
no money <*_cept what was in Neall
pockets, so a meeting of the officers was
called in the Presidio Club and ' some
money was subscribed, which Mrs. Neall i
accepted as a loan and which subsequent j
testimony showed she had paid back the
day after Neall's return. Major Edie was !
then questioned on the shortage of troop
funds. He had been a member of the !
council of Investigation that went over
th. books of Troop B. and he described i
how they had not been written up from
the quarter ending March 31, 1898. Bills
to the amount of ?374 2& had been present
ed against the troop since ers disap
pearance. There was some attempt to
show something of the shortage of club
moneys charged to the negligence of the
accused, who was treasurer of the club,
but that line was evidently reserved for
another witness, for it was not followed
far.
On cross-examination the witness stat
ed thai Mrs. Neall, when he went to call
on her after her husband's disappearance,
declared her husband must be dead. Crit
tenden Thornton, who represents the ac
cused, questioned the witness closely as
to what he had found from the investi
gation of the troop books and how far
that Investigation went. The witness said
the council had no power to proceed fur
ther than to ascertain if any money had
disappeared. There was no evidence to
go by except the unpaid bills, which had
been kept; and these he admitted were
all on hand and easy of access and there
had been no further demands made on the
troop except those which came ln just
after Neall disappeared. Thone bills too
it was shown, were all of this year's
dates, and Thornton brought out the fur
ther fact that there was no knowledge
of the fact that the tradesmen presenting
the bills had refused further trade or had
feared any loss.
"He failed to write up his books from
vouchers on hand, and that was the ex
tent of hjs neglect of duty to that de
gree?" was Thornton's question.
"Yes," was the answer, "that was his
neglect of duty to that degree so far as
we could learn from the papers."
Major Edie also brought out the fact
that the duties of treasurer of the club
war- somewhat onerous, the inference be
ing that tho neglect of duty in that par
ticular was also due to carelessness rather
than to viciousness.
Major Edie has been ordered to Manila
with the lirst transport, and BO Thornton
asked leave at that time to examine him
for the defense. The room was cleared
and the court considered, announcing a
few minutes after that such a procedure
would he allowed. â¢
Thornton immediately took up the Bub
ject of Neall's health. The witness said
be had attended to Neall for the effects
of a severe attack of the grip, and he had
advised him to go to bed and stay there.
Neall had been attacked in December of
1898, and owing to his mental and physical
exhaustion he had consulted Edie ' pro
fessionally, as well as in a friendly way.
It was also s_own hat during the recent
war Neall had been performing a great
deal of extra duty, and it ran him down so
he was seriously in need of' rest. "He was
then really keeping up on alcohol," were
the words of the witness.
"Do you consider," questioned Thorn
ton, "that if he had been in his normal
state he would have absented himself to
avoid the consequences of any action of
his own?"
"I do not believe he would, in his normal
state." said the witness.
That practically ended the proceedings
for tho day.
It is not likely the trial will take up
The Court-Martial in Session to Try Lieutenant John M. Neall.

MYSTERIOUS SMITH IS
OUT WITH A STORY
HE STATES HIS REASON FOR NOT
FIGHTING.
"Billy" Smith, the mysterious pugilist
who failed to meet George Green last
Friday night ln Woodward's Pavilion,
visited the office of The Call last evening
and desired the publication of a story
giving his reason for not fighting on the
evening in question. This is Smith's ver
sion of the affair:
r â¢ SAN FRANCISCO. April 9, 1899.
To the Sporting Public: I would like to en
lighten the public why I did not meet Green.
I have fought for the past ten years and I have
yet to meet the first man to accuse me of. be
ing a faker. I have always fought to win, and
when I heard the rumors of the fight being a
take I became disgusted, and knowing the men
I had to contend with, who were running the
fight. I made up my mind that if I caught them
doing anything wrong I would not fight. At
weighing--, time Alex Greggains told me that
he lust received a copy of the articles, and
that Messrs. Groom and Gibbs left out the
principal part of the agreementâ regarding the
complimentary tickets. The first article pro
vided that the club should pay for all com
pliment a rles ever 2l>o and for all counterfeit
tickets taken In at the door by the ticket taker.
.he*. are the articles that I signed.
Now the articles that Groom and Gibbs gave
to Mr. Greggains only called for 200 eompli
mentarlea and did not mention the counterfeit
tickets. Mr. Qreffzalns accused Groom of
changing the articles, which Groom denied.
Mr. Kennedy produced a copy of the first set,
and Mr. Groom said It was a mistake. Well.,
this mistake put me on my guard, as I made
It mv business to instruct the men I had at the
door to keep a sharp lookout for counterfeit
tickets and not to let a man pass without tak
ing his ticket and putting the coupon in the
box. This was done until the press tickets
came ln. Insead of taking the press ticket and

of shining coins knew him not. Yester
day the busy little Italian colony
spoke only "Zocchi," "Zocchi," and
was doing its utmost to spread abroad
his fame.
Zocchi has been commissioned by the
committee that repre^ .nts the Italian
Mutual Benevolent Society to carve in
marble and granite the monument that
is to be placed in the center of the new
Italian cemetery at San Mateo, and
â which will be the colony's tender trib
ute to all who find a last resting place
there. V â¢:.
Competition for the honor was keen.
Eight of the best known local artists
eagerly sought for the prize, but the
anarchist sculptor's work, by unani
mous vote, was awarded the contract,
that calls for a monument twenty
three feet high resting on a pedestal
fifteen feet square, and for which tho
artist's emolument Ib to be $1000.
When the Italian Benevolent Asso
ciation purchased Its cemetery lot at
San Mateo President Ravenna essayed,
by general subscription, to raise a fund
for a monument. Money, however,
was coming ln but slowly, when J. F.
Fugazi, with characteristic generosity,
rutting half of It In the box, the ticket taker |
would only tear off one corner and jrlve the
ticket back, and instead of putting the torn
otf piece In the box he would throw It away
and the fighters would get no account of the
mÂ°n uaeseU in on nuch tickets.
Those tickets were cold on thÂ« outside, and
when I called Mr. Groom's attention to the j
matter he would not allow the ticket taker to |
put them in the box. My men insisted on hav
ing them put In the box. but it was no use.
He told the men he would have them put out
if th<\v Interfered with the ticket takers. ThÂ«n
down to Bee what, he meant. I saw one
Supervisor bringing eight men In without a
ticket. I asked him why he did not pive the !
Supervisors their tlrkets. lie said he did, but I
they Rave- them away. Then I knew I was get
ting the wont Ol it. and I told Groom if there i
was not $2500 in the house I would not fight.
They offered $1500, which I refused, and so did
Mr. Green refuse the offer. The first thins I
knew I saw Green In the ring, and he wanted
the club to give him the purse. This was a
funny move on the part of Gr?en, who did not
even have hla shoes laced when he entered the
ring.
Now as to George Green. I will meet him
before any club outside of the so-called Na
tional Club, and bet him as much as he wants.
I am ready to meet him Inside of ten days.
There Is another mean trick that Mr. Groom
played on me. He came and asked me to let
Jim Jeffords box Collins ten rounds, to which
I consented. After training three weeks and
paying Jeffords' expenses, Mr. Groom got his
club doctor to say that Collins had heart fail
ure. Mr. Greggains had Dr. O'Donnell to ex
amine Collins, and Dr. O'Donnell pronounced
him all rightâ that there was nothing the mat
ter with his heart. I asked Groom who was
going to pay Jeffords' expenses, but he would
not listen to me. The whole difficulty with the
match was that Jeffords would not cut the
purse for Green. From the way Mr. Green has
been acting. It looks as though he were inter
ested in this club.
Now I will let the public Judge for themselves
who was at fault. I am not the first fighter
that these men have robbed, and the quicker
they are out of the business the quicker the
sport will elevate.
I will state again that I am ready to fight
Green within ten days for a side bet.
Another thine;, Mr. Groom wanted me to pay
the refereeâ something I never â¢ heard of a
fighter doing before.
These two Groom and Gibbs â have
pulled off all the fake fights, or so-called con
tests. that have taken' place In this city. â¢ .
I will rinse, hoping this letter will enlighten
the public of the kind of men who are running
the National Club. I remain, truly yours.

Foreclosure Proceedings on the Big
Graham Note Commence.
The action instituted by John D. Spreck
els & Bros. Company against R. F. Gra
ham, ex-superintendent of the Beaver
Hill coal mine and the Coos Bay, Rose
burg and Eastern Railway and Naviga
tion Company, to recover on a promissory
note of $523,162 50, executed in 1897, went to
trial before Judge Bahrs yesterday morn
ing. '-,
In the action W. F. Preston and W. L.
Pierce are representing the plaintiff and
A. A. Moore of Oakland the defendant.
The morning session was taken up in ar
gument on the question as to whether the
action was one in law or equity. It was
contended on oehalf of the plaintiff that
the action was equitable and this view
was taken by the court, and an order de
nying a trial by Jury was entered.
More legal points together , with the
reading of the pleadings in the action oc
cupied most of the afternoon session, but
before an adjournment was taken W. D.
K. Gibson, secretary of the plaintiff cor
poration, was placed on the stand. He
identified the note and testified that In
terest due to date on the note amounted
to $32,174 50, and that there was due on the
date suit was filed, June 13, 1898, the sum
of $0277 94. During the course of the tes
timony argument was advanced by coun
sel for the defendant that the present ac
tion could not be maintained, as in the at
tempt to foreclose on the pledges, with
out consideration of the mortgage, a split
ting of demands resulted, a condition
claimed to be obnoxious to local statutes.
The court held otherwise, however, and
the case proceeded. A few figures were
given by the witness, after which the
case went over till this morning.

the monument. Artists were notified
and asked to submit designs. Friday
last eight designs were submitted and
a note received from Zocchi asking the
committee to call and view a clay
model of the proposed monument he
desired to submit.
In a little hovel on Vallejo street, be
tween Sansome and Battery, in a tiny
dark room that answered for both liv
ing room and studio, Zocchi received
the monument committee. In a shad
owy corner the model stoodâ a model
that filled the committee with delight
and wonder and made each man turn
round and congratulate his neighbor.
The work pleased on account of the
originality of the design, its tender, ex
quisite beauty and the rare art shown
ln the modeling of the angel of death,
who stands at the right of the heaven

Zocchi will immediately begin his
work, and as soon as the monument Is
completed it will be placed ln the new
Italian cemetery.

with the little band of harmless local

not those usually attributed to the an
archist, but rather the broad, generous
theories of a universal brotherhood.
ANOTHER WEEK
OF COMIC OPERA
AND VARIETY
All that the Southwell Comic Opera
Company needs to make a success of
the fifteen-weeks' season at Morosco's
is a series of comfortably sized audi
ences. The singers live up to the fa
vorable impression secured at the open
ing performance. Last night they even
more than duplicated the success of
"The Black Hussar" in a lively, well
dressed, well-staged and well-sung
production of the "Queen's Lace
Handkerchief." Under almost any cir
cumstances the performance would
have been creditable, and it was es
pecially so considering that the occa
sion was the first night. As a rule the
stock companies of San Francisco are
not very fortunate on first nights. But
it is the business of a new broom to
sweep clean, and certainly the South
well people started their second week
with a tidy and skillfully managed per
formance of an attractive opera.
The ensemble was notable for its bal
ance and unanimity. The smaller con
certed pieces were sung with telling
pace and enthusiasm, and the big
choruses" were given out with splendid
volume and accord. The fascinating
waltz-time finale of the second act was
smashingly sung and. vigorously en
cored. These choristers not only sing
a good sturdy note, but they act, get in
and out of place with refreshing free
dom.
The opera, although It has not been
given here in several years, is too well
known to demand detailed description
The book is as good as most of the old
books and the music is Johann Strauss
at his waltzful best. Daisy Thorne had
the part of the Queen last night and
proved quite equal to its light difficul
ties. Miss Edith Mason was the Irene
and an excellent one in both song and
action; and Miss Hattie Bell Ladd
figured handsomely in His Majesty's
snug tights. Mr. Persse, the tenor
was not in the best voice, but as the
melodized Cervantes he was the mascu
line most of the show. Mr. Wolff found
large vent for his comic and vocal pow
ers in the part of the prime minister
and made a better showing than he did
last week; and Arthur Wooley was in
offensively bumptious as the Sancho
Panza.
The company will make a stronger
bid for favor next week with "Erminie"
for the bill, and a .till stronger one the
week after with "El Capitan." Several
serious operas are in prospect, includ
ing Puccini's "La Boheme."
Columbia.
De Koyen and Smith's ever-popular
opera, "Robin Hood," was presented at the
Columbia last night by the Bostonians to
a crowded house. The occasion was note
worthy, as it marked the three thou
sandth performance of the opera, a rec
ord that has never been equaled by any
other composition in this country. It was
staged with the usual effectiveness and
all the popular numbers had to be re
peated again and again.
Helen Bertram made a charming Maid
Marlon and met with a flattering recep
tion. William Broderick scored a success
as Will Scarlet and sang his two num
bers in such a manner as to call forth
enthusiastic applause. The cast also
comprised Henry Clay Barnabee as the
Sheriff of Nottingham, W. H. Mac Donald
as Little John. William La yin as Robin
Hood, Jessie Bartlett Davis as Alan-a-

FORD ACCORDS
ADVICE TO THE
COMMISSIONERS
Blackstock's Plan to
Be Reconsidered.
FREIGHT RATE REDUCTION
__________
EDSON WILL FIGHT AGAINST
RESCISSION. ; -
The Railroad Commissioners Postpone
the Southern Pacific Case Until
Their Next Session on the
24th of April.
The Railroad Commission held a ses
sion yesterday and that is about the
extent of what was done. It was ex
pected that the Blackstock resolution
rescinding the resolutions of the former
board on the 25 per cent freight reduc
tion on Southern Pacific rates was to
be discussed anew on a motion of E.
B. Edson for reconsideration. The en
tire matter was postponed, however,
until the next regular meeting, April 24.
The Commissioners had sent a series
of questions to Attorney General Ford,
W. W. Foote and Robert Y. Hayne,
covering the legal aspect of the matter
and these gentlemen attended the
meeting armed with typewritten an
swers. The questions propounded by
the commission were as follows:
1. Can the board legally adopt the
entire Blackstock resolution, re
scinding the action of the former
board, while the suit now against
the board is pending?
2. Can the Board of Railroad
Commissioners rescind the 25 per
cent resolution without rescinding
the entire resolution of the former
board, the 8 per cent resolution in
cluded?
3. Would it be to the legal advan
tage of the State of California to
have the board rescind the entire
resolution of the old board, even if
they have the legal right to do so?
4. Can the present board legally
serve any rate on grain on the
railroad company while the ques
tion is in its present standing in the
courts?
5. Should the Board of Railroad
Commissioners rescind the action
of the old board, as proposed by
the Blackstock resolution, what
would become of the costs in the
suit of the railroad company
against the commission that is now
pending?
The Attorney General's report reads
Referring to question No. 1, I should
say that the board may legally adopt
the entire Blackstock resolution re
scinding the action of the former
board while the suit now against the
board is pending. There is nothing' in
the law or in any order made by the
court that would prevent such action
upon the part of your body.
Referring to question No. 2, I would
say that Inasmuch as the resolutions
In question appear to be separable, ln
that they Involve two propositions
one looking to a 25 per cent reduction
of freight rates in general, the other
to an Immediate reduction of 8
per cent upon grain ratesâ the
6oard Itself having acted upon them
separably, and the court having held
that the respondents (the Board of
Railroad Commissioners) "are entitled
to have the grain rates considered
separably from the 25 per cent reduc
tion on other freights, ' I am of the
opinion that your honorable body may
"rescind the 25 per cent resolution
without rescinding the entire resolu
tion of the former board." :" ,J .
Referring to question No. 3, wherein
you ask ii it would be "to the legal
advantage of the State of California
to have the board rescind the entire
resolution of the old board," I would
say that "advantage," according to
the lexicographers, means "to obtain
a gain or vantage over the other
party." (See Century and Standard
dictionaries.) "Legal advantage"
would, therefore, mean "to obtain a
gain or vantage in point of law over
the other party." A rescission of the
resolution in question would destroy
the cause that gave birth to the pend
ing suit, and with the destruction of
the cause the suit itself must fall, ex
cepting as to the matter of costs.
The direct result, therefore, of the
suggested action would be a termina
tion of the present litigation. It could
scarcely be said that the State of Cal
ifornia would thereby "obtain a gain
or vantage in point of law." In fact,
a present termination of the pending
litigation would leave the parties
thereto precisely as they are now. so
far as the law Is concerned. I am,
therefore, of the opinion that no "le
gal advantage" would accrue to the
State by a rescission of the resolu
tion to which you refer.
Referring to question No. 4, I would
say that under the order of the court
as at present existing your honorable
body Is prevented from serving or en
forcing any rate upon grain transpor
tation that would involve a reduction
of 8 per cent of such rates as they
existed on October 12, 1895. Until this
order shall have been modified or set
aside it must be obeyed by your hon
orable body.
Referring to question No. 5, I beg to
state that the question of costs Is a
matter for determination by the court
upon a consideration of all the facts
and conditions relating to such ques
tion. There is no statutory rule gov
erning the matter of cost in suits ln
equity In the Federal courts, their tax
ation being left to the chancellor who
tries the cause. It Is, therefore, im
possible to state at this time what the
judgment as to costs would be under
the conditions named in your letter.
The report of W. W. Foote and
Robert Y. Hayne is more elaborate than
that of the Attorney General, but they
both agreed in the sanent features of
the case. Sv .
On motion of Blackstock the entire
matter was laid over for the next regu
lar meeting. E. B. Edson wished to
explain his vote when the Blackstock
resolutions .were adopted. He stated
that his affirmative vote at that time
was for the sole purpose of moving a
reconsideration of the rscinding resolu
tions. Before adjournment and before
voting for the postponement of the
grain rate matter he obtained an oral
guarantee from the two other members
of the commission that he would be al
lowed to call for a reconsideration at
the next meeting.

Lardinois is possessed of a birdlike and

Miss Burkhart was assisted by James

appropriate and Miss Burkhart's ideas of
the fairy and the mortal maiden with an
appetite for wine were very amusing.

Do you suffer pain in your head, back, hips or joints?
Are you neuralgic, dizzy, tired, worn-out, sleepless,

Whence all these symptoms?
8 From Kidney Poison in the Blood.
How does the Poison get into your blood?
When your kidneys are sick, poison and disease-
breeding germs creep into your blood.
Well kidneys keep your blood free
from poison and filter all the impurities
out of the system.
You can be well by keeping your kid-
neys well.
If your water when allowed to re-
main undisturbed in a glaâ or bottle
for twenty-four hours, forms a sedi-
ment or settling or has a cloudy ap-
pearance, it is evidence that your kid-
neys and bladder need immediate at-
tention.
What your kidneys need is a gentle,
healing, tonic Influence that will soothe
their irritability and gently regulate
them.
The only thing that will do this is Dr.
Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the ideal kidney
restorative.
When your system is weakened and
run down build up with Swamp-Root.*
Briefly, the way to be well Is to pay
attention to your kidneys.
To take Swamp-Root when you are
Buffering from weak, unhealthy kid-
neys.
The great discovery Swamp-Root has
been tested in so many ways, in hos-
pital work, in private practice, among
j rlsy, the knockabout comedians, who are
playing a return engagement. They have
a new act which scored a success last
night. Querita Vincent made a hit in her
j two new songs, "On the Day When Dewey
Comes Home," by Joe Hayden. and "If I
Only Had a Job.'" She is still the reign
ing favorite. Other acts that scored well
were Charlton and Royce, Marie Wood
and Antonio Vargas.
Alcazar.
At the Alcazar last evening Ernest
Hastings gave an acceptable impersona
| tlon of Jack Luster, the character in
"Humbug" made familiar by Roland
Reed, while Miss Adelaide Fitzallen gave
some new, original and rather startling
facial effects descriptive of the various
emotions. For Instance, sorrow was de
! plcted by the, lady by throwing back the
I head, enlarging the mouth with accom
panying dots, dashes and dimples until it
looked like a torn pocket, a series of
sound ripples, half suppressed, that re
minded one of an anxious hen calling to
her brood, while her form quivered with
the grief she fain would express. Horror
at the duplicity of her husband was mani
fested by what in peopleâ not on the
boardsâ would be a snicker; surprise was
illustrated by a closing of the eyes, turn
ing her back to the audience and covering
her face with her hands. There was no
mistaking the surpriseâ in the audience.
In truth, Miss Fitzallen was afflicted with
a severe attack of "giggles" that proved
co disastrous to Miss Lyons not long
since. When she recovers "Humbug"
will prove most delightful to the Alcazar
fiatrons. for all the subordinate parts are
n capable hands. Although the perform
ance was slightly marred in places on this
account last night, the audience was
highly entertained by three young women
in one of the boxes, who seemed to have

AN APPLE-GROWERS' COMBINATION"
WALL street is not the only place in America
where the combination and consolidation of in
dustrial interests is being carried on. The spirit
of co-operation is infused throughout the whole mass
oi the American people, and the progressive element
is in all parts of the Union forming or trying to form
with more or less sagacity certain organizations
which will enable the producers in any line of in
dustry to obtain the full market value ot their
products.
The fruit-growers of the country are no exception
to the rule! They have long had local co-operative
societies of considerable strength, and now they are
reaching out for the upbuilding - of organizations an
an immense scale. Several of these exceed the limit
cf the States in which they had their origin and in
clude in their scope large sections of the Union, so
that they fairly presage the coming of a time when
there will be something like national co-operative
associations acting with force in every held and every
market.
One of the largest of these associations is that of
the prune-growers, which is now being built up in
this State and is intended to include all the growers
of prunes on the Pacific Coast. An even larger asso
ciation, however, has just been formed in Illinois
under the name of the Mississippi Valley Apple-grow
ers' Association. That is truly a gigantic undertaking,
for the area of the Mississippi Valley is yast and the
number oi apple-growers within it is sufficient to form â 
an army.
The objects of the association are to make known
to the members the best methods of selecting, plant
ing and cultivating trees and disposing of the crop.
It is noted by expert authorities on the subject
that the growth of orchard interests in this country
and the increasing exports of American apples to
foreign markets arc sufficiently important to warrant
concerted effort in the directions indicated by the
new association.
The increasing consumption of fruit as a food rather
than as a luxury is one of the notable features of the
recent development of civilized life. The rate of that
increase would be augmented if the marketing of the
fruit crops could be made more effectively and more
cheaply than at present. There arc some parts of the
country which arc glutted with fruit during the sea
son, while in other parts good-sized towns and vil
lajres have hardly any supply at all.
Co-operation and combination will enable the pro
ducers to open up these comparatively closed markets
nnd thus confer a benefit while obtaining one for
themselves. At any rate these combinations are not
of a speculative character like most thai have been
formed in Wall street. .They represent a wholesome
progress in the community and tend to the general
welfare.
There ..re many men of many minds in the East
concerning the significance of the Chicago election,
but the experts agree on one point: that the slight
vote given Altgeld is an evidence that free-silver
Democracy has collapsed in Chicago and Altgeld has
ceased to be a leader of anything bigger than a ward
faction.
The flurry and slump in Wall street on Friday were
not unexpected by far-sighted men. nor is the result
likely to be injurious. In fact, there has been an in
flated speculation there for a long time and the sooner
the safety valve opens and lets out some of the steam
the better.
In saying that if he had been about to engage in
the newspaper business he would not have signed the
r.nti-cartoon and .signature bills Governor Gage has
applied his "caustic verbiage" to his own record with
pretty good effect.
There is a wide difference between the position of
Kaiser William on his throne and Dreyfus in his
island prison; and yet in one respect they are. alike;
Roth have a desire to see. Paris next year and both
are likely to be disappointed.
The London fad ci sending messenger boys from

THE FIELD FAMILY.
THE death of Judge Field leaves but one sur
vivor of that remarkable family. They were all
born in the quiet old town of Haddani, in Con
necticut. It is not a town at all in the Western mean
ing, but m township. Within its limits is a church,
and now there is a railway station, and the modern
postal and other necessities have required a subdi
vision into several Haddams, designated by the points
of the compass. But the parents of this family lived
in Haddani as it was when it reached that eminence
which formerly immortalized a place, and had a long
meter tune named for it in "the book of hymns pre
; pared for the public worship of God in song." Had
i dam has stood to this day in much of its primitive
! garb. and virtue as it was when the elder Field tilled
his small bit of stony land week days and preached
in the quaint old church on Sundays. While the boys
were young he moved over into the Berkshire Hills
in Western Massachusetts and there reared his family.
His income never exceeded $600 a year, and yet that
sturdy. self-denying father gave his four sons a college i
education and sent them into the world physically and ;
m.nlalh well armed for their careers. He had the j
reward of his abstemious and toilsome life in living to j
know that he had reared four of the greatest Ameri- :
cans that were ever rocked in one cradle. He lived
to see his boy Cyrus prove his faith that ocean cables
could connect every part of the planet by telegraph
and to see his boy Stephen take his seat on the great
est judicial bench in the world, and his boys David j
and Henry foremost in their professions. Old "Had- I
dam"' is sung by the worshiping congregations, but
the story of how Cyrus laid the cable is ticked back
and forth between the Antipodes every minute in the
yenr.
While it is true that at one time Cyrus W. Field
ranked as a capitalist and a millionaire, it is also true
that these four remarkable brothers had all achieved
eminence and reached first place by dint of quality
and character before any of them had acquired even
a modest fortune.
Looking back to that New England fireside, the
mind is impressed and depressed by the changes that
fill in the space between the childhood of this family
ami the close of their careers. The income of six
hundred dollars on which they were reared and edu
cated does not now seem to suffice for the support of
a single man, much less for the training of four boys
in college.
In their case there was more in it than the college
training. Judge Field's career is full of acts refer
able to his memory of his early life. In California he
was the author of our exemption laws, releasing from
execution for debt all the means of obtaining a living.
He arrived here in the fall of '49 and soon observed
the judicial confusion when the early courts attempted
to adjust the rival claims of miners. Going back to the
principles of equity and the memory of that strait
way of his fathers, wherein all food and shelter had
depended upon the judicable right to the little they
had. he framed and passed in the Legislature of 1851
this statute: "In actions respecting mining (alms
proof shall be admitted of the customs, usages Or
icgulations established and in force at the bar, or
diggings embracing such claims: and such customs,
usages or regulations when not in conflict with the
constitution and laws of this State shall govern the
decision of the action."
This was the first time in our history that a class
of laborers were empowered by statute to make their
own laws respecting property and to have them en
forced by the courts. The principle was adopted by
the feral Government and became the law of the
land.
Judge Field drew the statutes organizing the judi
cial system of California, and as legislator and Judge
infused into our laws and the decisions interpreting
and applying them the spirit which has made them
the panoply of the rights of person and property.
Even in the legal profession there will long be con
troversy over many of his decisions and over his opin
ions when in the minority of the bench, but the high
tendency of his work as a Judge was to entrench in
dividual right and liberty. In the Miliigan case he
decided against the right to try a civilian and condemn
him before a court-martial, and extended to every citi
zen the constitutional guarantee of a trial by jury.
This and the other cases growing out of the Civil War
required the highest judicial courage in making the
decisions, which were counter to the infuriated public
opinion and the potent passions generated in that
struggle.
The Miliigan case was closely followed by^Mis
souri vs. Cummings. The reconstructed constitu
tion of Missouri provided heart-searching test oaths,
containing not less than thirty affirmations as to past
conduct, and in denial of sympathy, personal or po
litical, with any one who took part in the rebellion. In
a border State, where man; families had sons in each
army and the parental heart could not outlaw and for
get its young, such an oath was a peculiar atrocity.
Yet persons who would not take it were forbidden
to practice a profession, to nurse the sick, shrive the
dying or bury the dead!
Mr. Cummings. a Catholic priest, was indicted,
convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary for serv
ing at the altar of his church without taking this test
oath. The case went to the Supreme Court of the
United States, where Justice Field's view of it pre
vailed and he wrote the opinion of the court which
forever struck down in this republic the system of
expurgatory oaths which the spirit of vengeance had
written into the fundamental law of Missouri. In the
same line followed his opinions in ex parte Garland,
in which Augustus H. Garland, afterward Senator and
Attorney General, was the parly, and who within a
few weeks fell dead in the Supreme Court room be
fore the bench where Justice Field reinvested him
with civil rights, the McArdle case, and many others
in which his judicial opinions extended over the
States lately in rebellion and to their people the
rights guaranteed by the Federal constitution.
It is all history now, and the actors have both
passed from the stage, so there is no impropriety in
admitting that General Hancock drew not only his in
spiration but the form of its expression from Judge
Field in the proclamations he issued when he became
military Governor of Louisiana and "saluted the con
stitution."
Elsewhere and more in detail the facts in the his
tory of Judge Field as a judicial officer will be en
larged. It is a long record, extending from 1857 to
1897, and is a rich mine of legal lore in which stu
dents and Judges will search for principles and their
applications, to be rewarded more abundantly than in
the record of any other Judge in this century, either
here or abroad.
Judge Field was a traveler in his childhood, saw
Europe in his teens, acquired a good use of French.
Italian and modern Greek. He crossed the ocean
often in later life and was the guest of lawyers in
England and France.
It is said of Disraeli . that when an adverse vote in
the House of Commons had overthrown his Ministry,
and he was commiserated by a friend, he replied, "I
am so glad to he free. For ten year. I have longed
to see the buds come out at Hughes ,
Hughenden was his rural home in the country, and
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APEIL 11, 1899.
while ruling an empire his heart had been with what
Jean Ingelow calls "the green things growing." So
Judge Field in the midst of the great labors of his
office and the social exactions of his station longed
always to be in the Berkshire Hills. And it was the
custom of the four brothers before death broke their
ranks to meet there in the midst of the scenes of their
childhod and enjoy the memories of the past.
G^GE ON THE PRESS LAWS.
A REPORT from Los Angeles states that Gov
ernor Gage, having been asked whether there
is any truth in the rumor that he is to enter
upon the publication of a newspaper, replied with an
emphatic denial and added: "Do you think I would
have signed those anti-cartoon and signature bills if
I had had any thoughts of descending to the news
paper level? Another thing: my administration
needs no organ to bolster it up. It will speak for
itself."
Truly the administration is speaking for itself and
none can mistake the meaning of the speech nor the
caliber of the men whose mind it represents. By his
own words the Governor makes it known that had
he any intention to engage in journalism he would
not have signed the cartoon and signature bills. Now
the question comes: Why would he have not signed
them?
Clearly the Governor recognizes that the object of
the two acts was the. injury of the press, the purpose
of their authors was to inflict harm upon newspaper
men; and the Governor is of the opinion that when
in operation the two laws will have such effects. So
if he were a journalist or had stock and interest in a
newspaper he would have vetoed the bills. Why,
then, did he sign them?
The only meaning of the Governor's words is that
what he would have refused to sanction, had it af
fected his business, he is willing to inflict upon others.
He signed the bills for the purpose of injuring jour
nalists. He is willing to do that injustice, knowing it
to be unjust, and to strike that blow at the freedom
of the press, knowing the blow to be unfair and foul.
The mental caliber of the man was shown by the
act of approving the bills and the moral caliber by the
confession that he would not have signed them had
they affected his interests. Such a confession of
petty spite was never before made by an American
politician, and it is doubtful if such mean motives ever
before prompted a Governor in the performance of
his official duties.
Dogberry of old made a special request that he
should be written down an ass. Governor Gage makes
no such request of journalism. His administration
speaks for itself.
POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY.
THE play of opposing forces in civilization is
more complex, but governed by law as plainly
as the tides. Just now it is interesting to ob
serve that in the United States under democratic in
stitutions, though with less intensity than a few
months ago. the superficial tendency is centripetal or
ir the direction of centralization, while in Europe and
even in the fossilized despotisms of the East a cen
trifugal movement or liberalizing inclination, with
many indications of permanence, is manifest.
A few words will serve to clarity these propositions.
In the United States the enormous growth of monop
olies and the development of imperialistic ambition
are plainly centripetal. In Asia and in Europe the
opposite or centrifugal pressure is more deeply
marked. The Government of Japan has literally burst
loose from the cerements of ages, and that nation has
fairly entered the arena of democratic rivalry and ad
vancement In China the light of modern progress
baa reached the most stolid conservatism that history
reveals, and the rapacity of the clashing power- has
awakened the Rip Van Winkle of imperialism from
its dreamless sleep.
Perhaps the most saturated exponent of paternal
despotism of the nineteenth century, certainly of its
latter half, is the German Kaiser. His expressed con
ceptions of divine right, restricted only by his in
dividual belief in God and by his individual acknowl
edgment of responsibility, have equaled all precedents
and have surpassed the absolutism of Napoleon Bona
parte. Yet in the midst of his anachronistic reign he
is forced to admit the existence of a constitution in
Germany and to surrender his will to the Bundesrath
and the Reichstag on two such important matters as
the increase of his army and the suppression of strikes.
The Czar of Russia, however Pharisaical in connec
tion with his brutal ukase against Finland his procla
mation may be, has nevertheless deferred to the grow
ing demands of his people by his initiative in the in
ternational peace conference, and has even suggested
that quarreling nations should be governed by the
code of the duello and that every cartel should be
delivered by a second.
The broad fact to which only the pessimists are
impervious is that irrepressible education has per
meated the world and raised the standard of intelli
gence among ordinary people to a level that places
the head of popular sovereignty among the imperial
jewels. Even Czars and Kaisers can no longer pre
tend to unconsciousness of the existence of this uni
versal and only logical authority for government. The
deepest political truth of all, which foreign potentates
and domestic usurpers, even Mr. C. P. Huntington
himself, would do well to learn, is that all Govern
ments exist by the consent of the masses, whether, as
in our own country, expressed through the ballot and
incorporated into constitutions, laws and administra
tive methods, or, as in Russia, Germany or Austria,
implied from passive submission. As we stand on the
confines of the twentieth century and realize what
schools and books and tongues, aided by inventive
genius and by the myriad forms in which steam and
electricity have brought the human race together,
have accomplished it is too obvious for discussion
that despotisms rock on the disturbed waves of suffer
ance and endurance, and that the aroused sovereignty
of man is only restrained by concessions and by its
preference for the slow but regular methods of peace.
The American citizen who observes and who com
prehends the signs of the times will be filled with
gratitude as he .appreciates how they were anticipated
by the founders of this -republic, who opened to lib
erty and order the highways of the constitution that
have been safely trbdden for more* than a century and
that lead directly on toward the ineffable light and
beauty of a perfected fraternity. He will walk on
those roads and escape the thorny labyrinths of im
perialism and of anarchy on either hand. It will be
well for the false guides who have sought to turn their
countrymen from their march toward the heights of
Americanism if they drop their misleading lanterns
and again take their places in the advancing proces
sion of man.
The thing that grinds the King of Sweden just now
is that he cannot deal with Norway as the Czar did
â¢with Finland and get himself in good shape to talk
benevolently at the coming peace conference.
It is permissible to be pleased 'a little bit by the
report that the end of the Dreyfus affair is in sight,
but it would be risky to bet on it.

Poolselling Test Case
Comes Up.
IS COMPLAINT DEFECTIVE?
ATTORNEY ARGUES AT LENGTH
IN THE AFFIRMATIVE.
Judge Mogan Reserves His Decision
and the Police Are Prepar
ing for Emergen
cies.
The test case of H. L.. Jones, charged
with selling pools at the racetrack in vio
lation of the new ordinance, came. up for
hearing before a jury in Judge gait's
court yesterday afternoon after M. Hart,
one of the jurors, had kept the court
waiting for over half an hour. He made
an apology, but the Judge was inclined
to deal severely with him for contempt
of court till Attorney Ach and Prosecut
ing Attorney Joachim-en interceded for
him and his apology was accepted. - *-
When the first witness for the prosecu
tion, F. H. Green, secretary of the Pa
cific Coast Jockey Club, was called to the
stand Attorney Ach said he objected to
the swearing of any witness, as the com
plaint on file did not allege any public
offense, and was therefore defective. He
read from the complaint, which alleges
that the defendant ''did unlawfully and
willfully make a bet wherein money was
staked on a race between horses then and
there about to be run, find then and there
after the making as aforesaid of said bet
actually run in the aforesaid city and
county of San Francisco."
He also read the preamble of the ordi
nance, and claimed that the words "race
track in closure" or "coursing park" made
a limitation to these particular places.
The complaint did not allege where the
bet was made, or where the race took
place, and therefore was defective. Inci
dentally he attacked the validity of the
ordinance on the ground that plural
nouns were used as make "pools," "bets"
or "wagers," instead of make a "pool,"
"bet" or "wager." . fe
His principal argument against the
complaint was that it did not allege when
and where the race was run nor who the
defendant made the bet with, which he
contended was essential. He quoted nu
merous authorities in support of his con
tentions. He asked that the case be dis
missed on the ground that the complaint
was defective.
Prosecuting Attorney Joachimsen armed
that the language of the ordinance had
been followed In drawing up the com
plaint, but he was only stepfather to It,
and he reluctantly confessed that there
was a great deal in Ach's argument.
The Judge thought so also, unless some
authorities were quoted against the argu
ment of Ach. He asked Joachim? if
he had any such authorities, but the at
torney admitted that he had none to bring
forward. The Judge thereupon said he
would give his decision Wednesday night,
the Jury having been discharged early In
the argument till that time.
Captain '-"an. who had listened to
the argument, saw Attorney Joseph J.
Dunne, who had assisted Joachims in
drawing up the complaints, and Dunne
called upon the Judge. He said he would
stake his reputation on the validity of the
complaint, and was surprised when told
that Joachimsen had not referred the
Judge to a case In the Supreme Court of
Massachusetts, where it was held that
ln a poolselling complaint It was
not necessary to insert the name of
the other person to the bet. He was
furious that Joachimsen had disclaimed
drawing up the complaint and said that
if it had not been for the alterations in
sisted upon by Joachimsen there would
not have been any chance for any quib
bling about it.
Chief Lees was not put out by Ach's ar
gument, and said that if the Judge de
cided that the complaint was defective
they would draw up another one, and if
Ach contended that his client had been
once in jeopardy they would take the
matter before the Superior Court. There
are about twenty complaints altogether
of the same nature.

THE INCOMING WAVE.
Customs Surveyor Spear in a com
munication to Collector Jackson recites
that the growth of San Francisco's
commerce during the past year has
been so large that an additional force
Df twenty inspectors is required for his
3ivision of the service. This simple
statement of fact is pregnant with
meaning. For many years San Fran
cisco has slept by the Golden Gate,
ivhile the commerce of the Pacific once
ill her own, has drifted by. But at last
she Is awake. New conditions have
seen evolved by the passing years, and
the wave of prosperity, so often read
md talked about here in California, is
at last in sight. San Francisco Is once
more on the upgrade, and the condi
tions which so favorably affect the
commercial metropolis of the State will
exert a similarly beneficent influence
throughout ail of Central California.
Especially will this be true of the
counties contiguous to the bay, chief
if which is Santa Clara County. This
theme may have been worn somewhat
Â»f late, but it will bear even more at
tention than ha been given it. It is a
live; up-to-date topic. It Interests
everybody in this favored section of the
State, for it speaks of an end to the

ing and the beginning of a period of
justness activity, material progress and

realize the fact that the turn in the
tide has actually come, that there is
nothing fictitious about it, and that
there is a substantial foundation upon
which to build our confidence and cal
culations, the better able we shall be

Colonel Jackson About to Recommend
a Much-Needed Reform in, the
Work of the Custom
House.
Customs Broker P. W. Bellingall has
taken the lead in a very much needed re
] form for the benefit of the mercantile
3 community. He has made a strong ap
! peal to Customs Collector Jackson, and
j it is understood that the appeal is in the
; line of the Collector's opinion on the sub
i ject matter. Mr. Bellingall filed vester
] day with the Collector the owing let
, ter:
Believing that you are desirous of en
couraging anj* Improvement In the customs
eervlc- which may serve to promote, while
still protecting, all the rights of the Govern
ment. I am ;<ersuaded to lay before you
a suggestion looking to the expediting of ex
ports from bond. Many Importations of
rice, cement. Iron, tin plate and other arti
cles, either in bulk or in nearly uniform
packages, paying absolute ep._i_c -vies of
duty, are sold for export at _o close a
margin and conditioned upon such prompt
delivery to the export vessel that the ex
pense and delay incident to the hauling
man the importing vessel to the -warehouse
and thence to the export vessel pre
vents a sale, and I am of the opinion that
all interests would be amply protected with
out added work to your office were export
withdrawals afloat from the Import vessels
allowed upon the completion of the â Rare
house entry and permit. The inspector will
deliver only after weighing and after the
examiner has checked th- permit confirming
the rate cf inly as absolutely specific.
The letter was filed at so late an hour
yesterday that Collector Jackson had no
opportunity to consider it in the delibera
tion which it deserved, but It is believed
that he will adopt a course which will
be consistent with the best interests of
the merchants of this city and the State
At the present time and for many years
past importers have not been allowed to
make withdrawals of merchandise from
bonded warehouses prior to liquidation of
the warehouse entry until the actual
weight or quantity has been ascertained
from a preliminary report of the weigher

The importer could be compelled to pay

Again suppose some particular class or
merchandise is reported bs^Â£ApÂ£rateer
and assessed for duty at 50 per cent ad
valorem, the entry being duly liquidated
at this rate. The importer may appeal
to the Board of General Appraisers, al
leging that the duty should be only Â£4o
per .nt, and in due course of time nave
his contention sustained by the General
Appraisers, which would necessitate an
other liquidation of the entry. Pending
the decision of the General Appraisers tne
importer may have exported a portion of
the goods and the warehouse ledger ana
bond would necessarily have already been
credited with duty at 50 per cent. In ad
justing the matter it would have to be
treated in a manner similar to the exam
ples outlined above.
While the plan of allowing exports be
fore liquidation of goods subject to ad
valorem rates of duty is entirely feasible.
as shown above, vet it presents some com
plications, and for the present the broker
will be satisfied if the privilege of with
drawinr goods prior to liquidation is ex
tended to goods paying absolutely specific
duties and about which there can be no
contention whatever that the goods might
possibly be Fub.iect to ad valorem duties.
The granting by Collector Jackson of the
privilege desired" by the broker? would be
received with much satisfaction by ex
porters in this city, and it is believed
would Increase and fester the commerce
of this port

HURRIED TO
APIA, SAMOA
The Brutus Sails for
the Island.
TO COAL THE PHILADELPHIA
AUXILIARY YACHT LAUNCHED
AT SAUSALITO.
Three Sugar Boats Arrive â the
New Schooner Mary E. Foster.
Last of the Old Ship
Republic.
Uncle Bam wants coal at Samoa and
â¢wants It in a hurry, too. In consequence
the United States collier Brutus sailed
promptly at 10 a. m. yesterday with 4900
tons aboard and the supposition is she
will go direct to Apia. This Is a change
from the original plans. When the col
lier came down from Mare Island and be
gan taking in her cargo It was given out
that she was going to Guam with a sup
ply of black diamonds for the warship
there. The arrival of the Mariposa from
Samoa last Friday with news from Ad
miral Kautz of the Philadelphia changed
oil these plans, however. The work of
loading the Brutus was rushed to a con
clusion and yesterday, she sailed "under
_eaied orders."
Captain Cottman, l*. S. N., is in com
mand of the Brutus, and with him are j
Lieutenants Tarbox, McCully and Saf- ;
ford and Dr. Stone. The supposition is I
that the collier will go from here to Apia, ]
Samoa, and there coal the Philadelphia. |
From there she will go to Honolulu, take
on another cargo of coal and proceed to
Guam as originally intended. The Brutus !
is a good nine-knot ship and should make j
the run to Samoa in fourteen days.
One of the handsomest schooner yachts |
ever built in San Francisco was launched
from Menotti's ways in Sausalito yester- j
day. She is the property of Dr. V. P.
Buckley and A. Kanzee, owners of the
well-known gasoline launch Satellite, and
was christened Outing.
The Outing is fifty-four feet over all.
fifteen feet beam and eight feet deep.
She will have three feet of freeboard and '
should be a dry and comfortable boat ln
all kinds of weather. She is to be fitted
with an auxiliary set of engines with a :
feathering screw by the Union Gas En
gine Company, so Outing will be Indepen- I
dent of both wind and tide. On excur- !
sions the main dependence will be on the !
sails, the engines only being brought into j
us. * n a calm or against an ebb or flood I
tide. The new boat is to be luxuriously
fitted out and will start out on her Initial
cruise on May day.
Captain Lew Haven, late of the yacht
Sappho, has taken a great fancy to the
outing. Last year he had some very
pleasant cruises on his boat, but at the '
close of the season came to the conclu- '
sion that he would rather have a launch
than a "wind jammer." He accordingly
swapped the Sappho for the Alberta. ]
Now he wants to get back to his old love, I
and if he can get rid of the new one will
build a yacht like the Outing.
Three sugar boats made port yester
day. The schooner Mary E. Poster, with
.9,404 bags of sugar aboard, came up from
Honolulu in eighteen days; the barken
tine Planter came from the same port
with IS.St'o bags in nineteen days and the
schooner John G. North, with 9150 bags,
came from Kahului in twenty days.
The Mary E. Foster is a brand new
schooner on her maiden voyage and is
in command of Captain Thompson. She
was built by Hall Bros, at Port Blakeley
and is IsO feet long on the keel, 40 feet
beam and 16 feet deep. She took 1.150,000
feet of lumber from Port Blakeley to Ho
nolulu. She is a four-masted schooner
and, like all of Hall's build, is a very
handsome vessel.
The scaling tleet on the coast is doing
remarkably well. The schooner Enter
prise was spoken last Saturday off Ta
quina Bay with 457 skins, the Zillah May
with 425 skins and the Dora Sieward with
157 skins. This is only a starter, as the
vessels will foil the herds into Bering
Sea and probably double their catch.
Skins are now worth about $12 apiece, so
the sealers will do well this year.
The old American ship Republic, built
at Kennebunk. Me., In 1869, Is to end her
days under the British flag as a storeship
in the Gilbert group. Since being launched
she has been under the Chilean flag, then
under the British, back under the Ameri
can and now under the British again.
In the latter part of 1897 the Republic
sailed from Puget Sound for Australia
with a load of lumber under the Chilean
flag. She was caught in a terrific storm
and had to put in hero in distress. She
was patched up, sailed again and finally
reached her destination. After discharg
ing she went to Newcastle. X. S. W.,
where she loaded coal for Honolulu.
"When a few days out she sprang a leak
and had to put into Sydney in distress.
That was in November, 1898, and after
several attempts had been made at put
ting her in a seaworthy condition it was
given up as a bad job and her cargo was
discharged. The vessel was then sold
to some parties in Sydney, who put her

LAUNCH OF THE OUTING.
THE new auxiliary yacht of Dr. V. P. Buckley and A. Kanzee
was launched from Menotti's yard at Sausalito yesterday. The
new boat is a very handsome craft. She will be schooner-rigged
and as her smokestack will show but very little hlr machinery
will not be very much in evidence except when she is becalmed or
bucking the tide. The Outing will be ready to go into commission
on May day.

under the British flag. ; Last January she
was sold back to her captain, who again
ran Old Glory up at the fore, and now
she has been sold to Captain Joseph. Vos,
who will take her to the Gilbert group
under the British flag.
A short time ago the owners of the
British ship Argomene sold their vessel
to the Germans. This left Captain W. O.
Thomas without a command, and he was
congratulating himself upon the. chance
for a holiday when the ship Jessomene
arrived in England from thls_port. Cap
tain Thomas was ordered to take com
mand of her, and Captain T. Zeal of the
Jessomene was ordered to the Eulomene,
just in from Portland, Or. This leaves
Captain Ellis of the Eulomene without a
command and will give him a well-earned
holiday. Captain Zeal of the Jessomene
did not care very much for the change,
as he had been in that ship ten years.
The vessels and captains are almost as
well known in San Francisco as the
coasting fleet. ... v
John Driscoll and George Shering were
Injured aboard the transport Leelanaw
yesterday. They lost their footing and
fell into "the hold. Driscoll was wounded
about the head and had his leg broken,
while Shoring had several scalp wounds
and a badly contused shoulder.
Where to Go.
The thought uppermost in the minds of
all Just at this season of the year is where
to spend to the fullest advantage the
week or month that is allowed one for
a summer outing. The Samuel Soda
Springs in Napa County offers advan
tages equaled by few resorts of the coast.
Within easy access of San Francisco, in
one of the loveliest valleys of the State,
it affords opportunities for rest and recre.
atlon unexcelled. The spacious grounds
are delightfully laid out and a wealth of
flowers please the eye at every turn.
Pleasant drives through the adjacent
country are a feature of the place, while
good fishing is to be had within easy dis
tance. The water of the sorings has been
uniformly successful in the cure of dys
pepsia, indigestion, rheumatism and con
stipation. Not the least attraction of the
resort is the personal popularity of the
proprietor. Mr. J. R. Morris, whose long
experience is an assurance of care and
attention. *
PAN-AMERICAN RAILWAY.
Interesting Data Contained in the
Commissioners' Raport.
The Chamber of Commerce is in re
ceipt of the complete reports of the Pan-
American Railway Commission, and the
works are very interesting. The pro
ject was one of the pet hobbies of trie
late statesman, James G. Blame. The
object to be attained is a complete rail
way system, commencing with the big
railroads of the United States, running
down through the Central American
countries into South America and con
necting with the railway systems of
that continent. The commission was
con. posed of the beat engineers and the
most learned men of the world, and was
brought Into existence in 1890. Its prov
ince was to determine whether or not
the project was feasible. To this end

one party of surveyors ran their lines
from this country through Central Amer
ica. The second party began its work
in Ecuador, running north to meet the
first party, and the third party surveyed
to the south- from Ecuador, through that
country, into and through Peru and to
the border of Bolivia. This main line
was so laid out .that it could be in touch
with all of the systems of the countries
through which it passes. It is estimated
that the main line amounts to 10,228
miles from New York to Buenos A vies
and of this 4771.93 is already built. The
estimated cost of the main line, exclu
sive of all branches, will be $174,290,271.
The proposed line runs through some of
the richest timber, mineral and coal
belts in the world. The undertaking will
likely form one of the very interesting
subjects of consideration of the several
Governments interested, in the near
future.
On Trial for Murder.
Joseph Clark, who shot and killed Jo
seph P. Gross in front of the Market
street engine house on November 30 last,
was placed on trial before Judge Dunne
and a Jury yesterday. The killing was the
result of Jealousy on the part of the pris
oner, who suspected his victim of having
been intimate with his wife.

PICKING WINNERS A HARDTASK
FLEUR DE LIS BEATEN OUT BY
MARY BLACK.
Adolph Spreckels Made a Game Fin
ish â Arbaces Galloped In Ella
Boland Disposed of Some
Fast Two-Year-Olds.
In the years to come, when other Jock
eys replace those of to-day, and Eddie
Jones, then a man of mature years,
standing on the ground listens to the
applause showered on these riders by an
enthusiastic public, recalls the days of
old when he (was a popular idol, better
leave the Topmast race of yesterday out.
The son of Topgallant captured the last
race on the card at Oakland, but tne
race did not look so well. Rubicon was
among the starters and was backed. He
had everything his own way until tne
stretch was reached, then he grew
weary. Two outsiders moved up, and
so did Jones. Topmast, which receded
from 3 to 5 to 11 to 10, won distractedly
from Storm King. Rubicon ran un
placed. Jones should remember that pol
itics are not always a factor in the run
ning horse game.
Racing as conducted under the Corri
gan regime is a confused mess. No line
on the horses is possible. "Dope books"
have been laid away in the attic, and tins
seems a wise move. Three uncertain fa
vorites won' purses.
The racing opened with a mile and a.
sixteenth selling run, for which Aroaces
was sent to .the post an 11 to 10 favorite.
The Red Iron horse made all the run
ning and won with ridiculous, ease from
Henry C, a 50 to 1 shot. Sly was third.
Cavallo, which to all appearances was
kept out of the money by Hahn, finished
a fast-coming fourth.
Mike Daly's horse Frohman was ready
money ln the sprint over the Futurity
course. Caldwell left the favorite, Feb
urary. at the post, which made It only
a gallop for the Daly entry, against
which 8 to 1 was laid. Novia, the second
choice, was led out for the ilac. by
Ringmaster.
In her morning workouts Ella Boland
had shown alarming bursts of speed, and
was the real thing for the two-year-old
scramble, her odds being cut from threes
to 11 to 5. She was sent away in front,
and, never hard-pressed, earned the de
cision without difficulty. Rachel C came
from the rear, downing Basseda, the fa
vorite, for second place.
To use the favorite expression of Ad
miral Dewey, Adolph Spreckels proved a
fighter "from away back." capturing the
mile and a sixteenth run when looking
hopelealy out of it. Myth cut out tne
running, but tiring the last few yards
was collared and beaten a neck by the
Corrigan entry.
The seven furlong run seemed to be to
the liking of Fleur de Lis, and it was only
the tardy ride of Jones that beat the
mare. He allowed Mary Black and Miss
Rowena to obtain too much of a lead,
and then, making his move too late, was
downed a neck by the former mare, pi
loted by Johnny Reiff.

BURIED WITH ALL
MILITARY HONORS
FUNERAL OF THE LATE SUR
GEON HARLAN McVAY, U. S. A.
All Troops at the Presidio Turn Out
in Payment of the Last Tribute
to the Dead.
"With all the ceremony the Presidio
could afford the body of Captain Harlan
McVay, assistant surgeon of the United
States army, was laid to rest yesterday in
the national cemetery. Captain McVay
was surgeon for the post at Alcatraz.
The funeral was set for 2 o'clock and by
that time all the troops at the post had
been assembled in front of the post hos
pital and the pallbearers, in full dress,
were waiting to perform their sad duty.
The coffin was carried by eight stalwart
cavalry troopers, and the pallbearers
walked with them after it had been bound
fast to a flag-draped caisson. The coffin
was also draped in the national colors,
but there were no flowers. The pall
bearers were: Major Edward B. Moseley,
Captain Isaac P. Ware, .medical depart
ment; Captain Henry C. Danes, Third Ar
tillery; Captain James E. Brett and Cap
tain Henry W. Hovey, Twenty-fourth In
fantry, and Lieutenant David J. Rum
bough, Third Artillery.
Headed by the band of the Twenty
fourth Infantry the funeral train turned
down the road past the old artillery sheds
and the stables and then up past the new
brick barracks and to the cemetery on
the hillside. Just after the band came a
firing party of twenty-four from the
Twenty-fourth Infantry under command
Of Lieutenant Stanley W. Howland. Then
followed the caisson with its melancholy
burden, the officers of the post, the hos
pital corps, the companies of the Twenty
fourth stationed at the Presidio, with side
arms and under command of their non
commissioned officers, and then the cav
alry, dismounted and also with side aims.
The ceremonies at the grave were short
and ended with three volleys from the
firing party and the farewell call of
"taps" from the bugler.
FAMOUS OCULIST DEAD.
Dr. James B. Gibson Passes Away
While at Colorado Springs.
Word was received yesterday by John
G. Gibson, the well-known merchant of
this city, of the death of his brother, Dr.
James B. Gibson, who passed away at
Colorado Springs on Monday night. Death
was due to tuberculosis of the kidneys.
The deceased ranked among the fore
most oculists of the country. He was
formerly senior surgeon in the Manhat
tan Eye and Ear Hospital of New York
City. While in that position his name be
came familiar to the specialist- of Eu
rope and his opinions were sought by the
profession. Falling health compelled him
to seek rest at Colorado Springs, where
death relieved his sufferings. The funeral
will be held from his residence in Col
orado Springs. .*'"

so that his body hears but a slight re
semblance to the human form. From all
accounts the father, Thomas Rush, If re
sponsible for his son's condition. The
day before the child was born the father
kicked the mother and threw her down
stairs. From the time the baby was able
to creep about the floor the father beat
and clubbed it around until the tender
bones became twisted and misshape- to a
shocking' degree. Four years ago Rush
deserted his family and nothing has been
heard of him since.
The mother had been so badly treated
that, according to what Secretary Wad
ham learned, she was sent to the asylum
for the Insane, and when she was re
leased a few months ago she was taken
sick, and Is now In the County Hospital.
During all this time the little boy was
with his grandmother at 34 a ,_ Sheridan
street, but the old woman, now 70 years
of age. has been obliged to go to the
hospital, suffering with a complication
of half a dozen ills. Mr. Wadham will en
deavor to get the child placed in the
Children's Hospital. Everything consid
ered the unfortunate youngster is unu
sually bright and obedient.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 10.â Interest in stock
speculation to-day was on a diminished scale,
the dealings 14 -gating little over half a mil
lion _har__. Prices moved in an uncertain
manner and a number of marked net losses
resulted. There was a decline nt the opening
ln which the specialties particularly parti
pated, a midday rally by the Vanderbllts and
an afternoon decline In which the grangers
were prominent. The liquidation of Friday
permitted a number of brokers to return bor
rowed money and call rates were generally
easier, 6 to 7 per cent prevailing the greater
part of the day. Several million dollars of
sterling loans were made and call money closed
3 to 4 per cent. Foreign bankers apparently as
sumed that comparatively good prices were
probable here for money for a more or less
protracted period.
The sterling loans were responsible for an
easier tone in the sterling exchange market.
The recurrence of syndicate operators and the
flotation cf industrials is the basis for the ex
pectation of fair rates at least for money.
This week 125.000,000 approximately is to be
called in connection with â¢_*> flotation of the
American Pump Company, the Chicago and
Alton syndicate deal and subscription payment

The markets here were Irregular to-day on
closing before to-morrow's settlement. In

fears. They rallied later. Americans opened
above parity, but were idle. New York came
dull. The close was midway between the
best and the worst. The only features were
Chesapeake nnd Ohio and New York Central.
The latter spurted sharply on New York buy

money squeeze as merely a shake-out of weak
industrials. Tintos were 4.H.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 10.â Fine weather and an
expectation among traders that the Govern
ment crop report would be less extravagant as
to the serious injury to winter wheat than re
cent representations have been developed
weakness at the beginning. May opened %r<f%c
lower at from 70% c down to 7040. and as gen
eral liquidation set in the price slipped off
gradually to 70^-c. At that point the decline j
was arrested by a report from New York that i
fifty boatloads of wheat had been disposed of
for export. As that announcement was ac
companied by a statement that the weather on
the continent of Europe had turned unfavor
able for grain crops, early sellers showed a dis
position to buy back former holdings.
In the last hour of the session, confidence as
to the forthcoming crop report being bearish
was upset, and the market recovered all its
early declines. May closed %c higher.
Liquidation on account of the mild weather
and reports that seeding was well under way
in many States weakened corn early. Later,
however, buying by elevator people against
sales for shipment, together with the conclud
ing firmness of. wheat, caused a firm feeling
near the end. May corn closed %c lower.
Oats broke at the start on selling by elevator
Interests against corn purchased. Subsequent
ly the decline was recovered on bullish country
advices and a better casta demand. May oats
closed %c lower. Provisions were flat and
transactions consisted principally of changing
from May to July. There was an Impression
that much of the present May holdings would
have to be liquidated at a loss and the belief
prevailed that the market would be lifeless
and drooping until these holdings were liqui
dated. May pork closed 7%. lower; lard and
ribs, 2%c lower.

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
The Hay market Is demoralized at a still
further decline. There seems to be no limit
to shipments from the country, and the faster
the Hay comes in the faster It drops. . A car
of outside Oat Hay was bid in by the consignee
at $7 to save the shipper from total loss. A
few country holders have followed the advice
of -the merchants and are holding, back their
Hay, but most of them are shipping it In as
fast as they can, and It is this which keeps
the market demoralized.

The oVfccial report of the operations In the ;
I Consolidated California and Virginia mine :
j during the past week If as follows- 1400 levelâ ,
The west drift has bÂ»en extended 15 feet: !
total distance west from C. and C. shaft, 436
feet The face la In soft hanging wall rock .
with seams of moist clay. 1&50 levelâ The '
drain and water pipes are being repaired and
rearranged. IT.'O levelâ A temporary track has i
been laid and the northwest drift repaired
and cleaned out so that the northwest passage |
is now open. This drift starts from a switch .
fi4o feet west of the shaft and it 1b 200 feet to j
the first series of winzes connecting the 1650 j
and 1750, and at present Is the only open con- I
nertlon between those levels. The 1860 level
i is a station only, no level being opened from ;
it. but it Is In good condition and will be of '
! value In handling material from the pump
I compartment and In furnishing a new work
! ing base for pumping operations. As the j
| water goes down the shaft is found to be In j
good condition, whijl the pump compartment j
â¢ is full of wreckage from the Cornish pump- j
: Ing plant formerly In use In this shaft.
[ In the Ophlr mine during the past week th? j
i second crosscut from the northwest drift in
j the old Central tunnel workings was extended
; 4 feet, total 18 feet: face in almost solid
quartz, showing Iron sulphides of no value.
'â  The west drift was extended 14 feet, making a
i total of 115 feet. The ground passed through
! was of heavy clay. The Sutro tunnel connec
i tktfi was extended 14 feet, total 66 feet;- face
' again In hard hanging wall rock. In 'he
Opblr ground, as exposed by the north lateral
of the Putro tunnel, thorp are several streaks (
of good-looking quartz that may contain ore. i
They are opening them up to learn Just what
they are worth.
In the Union Consolidated mine they have
started west crosscut No. 1 at a point 100
I feet north from the top of the upraise, 266 feet |
i above the !W level, and advanced It 10 feet: I
i total length, 20 feet: face In quartz assaying
from $1 to $2 per ton.
In the Sierra Nevada mine the raise started I
In the north drift at a point 223 feet north j
' from the west drift to connect with the Riley i
: tunnr-1 has bren advanced feet; total length, |
;44 feet. The roof is in old ground which looks j
like an old drift that may have been run from j
the Cedar Hill tunnel. They tiavp been trou- |
bled with water from this drift during the
. week. 900 levelâ The south drift from the top
! of the raise so feet above this level was ad
> vanced io fpet .luring the week, total 142 feet;
face in porphyry.
In the nest ft Belcher and Gould & Curry
! mines during the past week the station on the j
; Putro tunnel level of the Oshlston shaft was
thoroughly secured by new timbering and the
1 shaft secured so that It could be examined and '
the water In the shaft measured. The water
. Is down over 60 feet below the Rutro tunnel
, lnvel. ThÂ» station will be secured, all xhf
water possible caught tip and an opening left :
! so that the water ran he measured from time
; to time and the work stopped until surface re- ;
i pairs on the shaft are completed. They are
! hauling lumber and getting ready to repair the
, shaft.
In thr Hale & Norcross mine they are clean- I
Ing out and repairing the connecting drift be
tween the main Incline and the Sutro tunnel

SUPERVISORS
Public May Pay $1.50

BILLS SETTLED AT OLD RATE
QUESTION OF PARK EXTENSION
GOES OVER ONE WEEK.
Improvement Clubs "Want the Elec
tion to Include Bonds for Other
Matters When Submitted
to the People.
After a week's consideration the seven
members of the Board of Supervisor
who have been identified with the ma
jority have arrived it the conclusion that
their ai :ion in reducing the price of gas
to J. 39 per thousand feet was ill-advised.
Lv tho face of argument presented by
the minority which indicated that that
f-.'-c? would give a reasonable profit, it
was decided at the meeting; yesterday ta
rescind the action of the previous week.
r. lowing upon this an attempt was
made to fix the rate for consumers at
Jl SO. This was finally referred to the
Struct Light Committee for consideration.
it whs decided to pay the bills of the
S in Francisco Gas and Electric Company
and tho Pacific Gas Improvement Com-
pany Cor lighting th streets .md public
buildings during December and January
at the rates specified in the contract.
This is the document pronounced invalid
by Judge Seawell recently. The action of
the majority was bitterly contested by
the minority throughout the heated de
bate.
The seven members who voted for re
scinding the action taken at the last
meeting were: Supervisors Holland, KaU
ben. Black, Phelps, Collins, Attridge and
Algeltlnger. The steadfast minority was
made up of Supervisors Perrault, Lack
mannJ Byington; Ilr-ver and _asy. Near
the close ox the debate, when the vote
on every question stood 7 to 5, Supervisor
Byington, who had fought valiantly with
the majority, seeing the hopelessness ot
it; quoted from Shakespeare's "Merchant
o_ '.Â«":
â¦
,Â£> You may as well go stand beside the 4*
... sea and bid the tide abate Its usual Â£
â¢ - height; you may as well do anything i
>â¢> that is most hard. â¦>
To this ie addedâ "as reach the mind of
th se who will not be convinced."
The fight opened on the Question of a
resolution presented by Supervisor __al
ben. He wanted the question of a reduc
tion in price for street lamps referred to
the Street Light Committee, of which he
is chairman. His resolution read:
"Whereas, This board did on April 3, 1899,
refer to the Committee on Street Lights a
resolution ln words and figures as follows:
Resolved; The compensation to be allowed
to the San Francisco Oas and Electric
Company for the light of street lamps here
tofore furnished and unpaid, and which
may hereafter bo furnished, until a new
contract Is entered Into, shall be 6 cents
per lamp per night, in lieu of 11 cents per
lamp per ntght as heretofore; and whereas,
the Committee on Street Lights. In order to
intelligently report on said resolution, deem
lt necessary to first obtain information from
the Gas InsjK-ct-r in relation to the subject
mktter of said resolution before reporting
thereon to this board; therefore,
Resolved. That the subject matter of
aaid resolution be and Is hereby referred to
the C!_s Inspector for his examination and
report to the Corruruittee on Street lights as
to tlie consumption of gas ln each lamp per
night, ani as to whether or not the rate
proposed in this resolution of fi cents In
lieu of 11 cents per lamp per night is a pro
portionate reduction of the price or rate a?
specified ln the contract ln connection with
the other service rendered, as compared
with tlie price or -rate set forth In resolu
tion No. 2621 (fourth series adopted a the
last meeting of the board April 3, 1899.
Supervlsor Lflckmann objected to tho
matter being referred to the committee.
He said the board had all the Information
it could hope to receive In the matter. He
said tho city l- paying two and sometimes
three times a* much as other cities. He
Instanced New York and Boston, saying
they paid $12 for service for which this
city is charged $3*5.
Supervlt-or Bvington thought the board
could net on tho fixing of rates at once,
;:s there was no possibility of change in
their view of the matter. They had just
as much light on the matter then as they
would ever have. The motion to recall
the matter from the committee was lost
by the usual voteâ 7 to 6,
When this matter had been disposed of
Supervisor Aigeltinger presented a short
r-solution rescinding the previous action
of the board lixing the price of gas at
tl 10 to consumer.. Both Perrault and Bv
ington wanted to know the reason of this
remarkable change of heart li one week.
In explanation Supervisor AigeJtlntrer said
he did not think $1 10 a fair' rate to any
corporation. When asked why it was not
fair when the reports showed It was paid
in other cities, he said he was entitled to
his own opinion In the matter) that no
business man would want the price of gas
cut 65 cents on the 1000 feet. He did not
ihink the company could pay its laborers
or its interest at that price.
S*'7ie. r visor Byington said a reason
should be given for the change of heart.
Seven men had voted for tho reduced rate
and if they wnnted to change their vote
now they should give their reason calmly
and dispassionately. The public, he said.
will think the board acts hastily and
without due deliberation If lt changes its
vote so readily. He held the board should
not allow compensation on a capitaliza
tion of the . is company for $17,000,000.
This debt should not be saddled on the
P<*Â«ple.
Supervisor Holland paid the hoard must
not intimidate capital. That gas, water
banking corporations should lie
treated Impartially and Induced to spend
tl elr money here. He voted under a mis
apprehension last week, he said. He
understood Mr. Dackmann to say that a
*_ ij J ol ' v as M per cent more than it
*i _ *''â  Hft found thin was not true,
and hcroe wanted to change his vote.
i pon a vote being taken the resolution

"Tou ought to advertise for people
to eat fruit juice on Grape-Nuts I
like them very much that way. I mix
fruit in and eat a sort of fruit pudding
which is very delightful to my palate'
and I find the food of a most nourishing
character. Since its use I have been
relieved of constipation." This was
written by a man In Buffalo, N. Y.
A nice fruit juice, such as comes
from canned peaches, pears, etc., makes
a delicious dish of Grape-Nuts, and
another favorite is to make a pudding
with sultana raisins, such as given in
the directions on the package. When
a man or woman once eats Grape-Nuts
he (or she) thereupon joins the Grape-
Nuts army, and never regrets it.

and January bills was then con
sidered. It was finally passed,
after many proposed amendments had
been defeated. Supervisor Deasy gave
notice that he would move for a recon
sideration at the next meeting.
Some discussion ensued over the recon
sideration of the proposition of the Mv- ;
tual Electric Light Company to light the
City Hall for 6 cents per 1000 watt hours.
Supervisor Algoltlnger moved it He over
for one week, as the committee was con
ferring with the Merchants' Association
on the lighting question.
This reason seemed to anger Supervisor
Perrault, who apparently thought the ex
cuse a trivial one. "I don't think a mem
ber should treat the remainder of this
hoard like "dunghills," he said. "The
Merchants' Association looks to me like
a great big fake. Everything is referred
to it these days." The matter went over
one week.
The resolution adopted by the Street
Committee at its meeting last week re
garding an election for bonds for the ex
tension of Golden Gate Park was read.
The Federation of Mission Improvement
Clubs requested that action be deferred
one week. It is purposed by its officers
to appear before tho committee at its
next meeting to ask that this matter be
reconsidered. They want an election at
the same time for a sewer, schoolhouse
and other bonds. At the request of Su
pervisor Attridge action was deferred.
The committee will take up consideration
of the matter at 4 p. m. Thursday.
The appropriation allowing $1000 for im
provements was passed to print. As the
city cannot get rid of the Chinese lepers
as expected, Supervisor Holland gave no
tice he would ask for an Increased ap
propriation to build the necessary accom
moqatlons.
George Dougherty was appointed pa
trol wagon driver, vice M. Cavanaugh, re
moved. Ned Elmore was appointed plum
ber's helper, vice Hugh A. Ward, re
moved. Supervisor Perrault explained
that It was a case of two Democrats be
ing replaced by two Republicans. This
when the question was asked as to
why the change was made.
The following resolution was adopted:
Resolved, That in order that the commis
sion, whose duty it is to count the cash in
the city treasury, may be able to verify
the general cash balance, embracing all
the moneys in possession of the Treasurer,
Instead of as now examining some twenty
two different balances shown by moneys
separately kept in the trays or boxes as
"special deposits," the Treasurer be
and is hereby authorised to enter upon his
books every day in the general cash ac
count the amounts received by him from
all sources, whether the same are moneys
belonging to the city and county or not, and
also to show each day the actual amount,
as aforesaid, of moneys in the city treasury,
in the general cash account, as requested by
ihs Honor the Mayor.
City and County Attorney Lane was re
quested for his opinion on the following
matters:
First. If goods, wares and merchandise
in bonded warehouses at 12 o'clock noon on
the first Monday ln March of each year can
be legally taxed for State or city and
county taxes?
Second. If consigned goods, wares and
merchandise ln original packages at 12
o'clock noon on the first Monday in March
of each year can be legally taxed for State
or city and county taxes?
Third. If roods Imported from a foreign
country while In original packages, upon
which the duties and charges at the Cus
tom-house have been paid and In th* hands

first Monday of March, can be legally taxed
for State or city and county taxes?
Tho City Engineer was requested to ex
amine and report to the board the ex
pens, of the establishment of grades on
all streets south of Golden Gate Park.
His Honor the Mayor was empowered
and required to purcnase for $12.">a> a piece
of property belonging to the estate of
William B. Cam It is intended for the
purpose of extending Twenty-fifth street
rom San Jose avenue to Guerrero, It Is
expected to effect a saving to the city
to take this action, rather than to begin
proceedings to conac*_n the property.
His Honor the Mayor vetoed the per
mit granted a storekeeper on Washington
.treet, near Montgomery, to erect a win
dow extending some inches on the side
walk. He held it interfered with the
rights of adjoining shopkeepers, and that
it granted one shopkeeper all were en
titled to it.
Thomas McCoy applied for a license
which would entitle him to solicit street
work-
A variously signed petition was pre
sented by property owners ln the vicinity
of Duncan street, San Jose avenue and
Valencia street, asking the board to open
Duncan street from San Jose avenue to
Valencia street, It was pointed out that
there are no cross streets cut through
here for five blocks. The board has al
ready under consideration an application
for the opening of Twenty-seventh
street through St. Luke's Hospital prop-
erty.
The various searchers of records asked
for a hearing concerning the examination
of land titles in the matter of the park
panhandle extension. They wish an op
portunity to bid on the matter in com
petition with the title insurance com
panies.
Dr. G. E. Pussdorf, superintendent phy
clan City and County Hospital, filed a
schedule showing* supplies required by
the hospital for the fiscal year 1899-1900.
City and County Attorney Dane report
ed to the board that he had received a
warrant for $12,000 in payment for the lot
of land on Howard street, near Third.
He had not paid over the money, as he
found a brick building encroaches two
and a half inches upon the easterly side
of the lot.

ATTEMPT TO ORGANIZE
RIVAL NEWSBOYS' UNION
LIVELY MEETING OF THE OP-
POSING FACTIONS.
Artie Jelinski Unsuccessfully Dis
putes the Leadership Conferred
Upon Robert Wall by His
Election as President.
Over a hundred unkempt and uncontrol
lable newsboys assembled in the quarters
of the recently organized Newsboys'
Home at 549 Howard street last evening
In response to a call issued for a meet
ing to organize a newsboys' union. There
was trouble at the start, caused by the
efforts of rival factions, headed respec
tively by Robert Wall and Artie C. Je
llnski, to run things, and several times a
riot was only averted by the presence of
Policemen McCormick and McNamara,
detailed to preserve order by the fore
sight of Joe Simpson, the youthful man
ager of the home.
The trouble arose indirectly through the
rivalry of two evening papers.. About
two weeks ago a newsboys' union was
formed and Robert Wall elected presi
dent, defeating Artie Jellnski. The move
ment was engineered by one of the even
ing publications, and Jellnski, who Is em
ployed by the opposition sheet, refused to
abide by the result. He consulted Simp
son and the latter became convinced that
Jellnski would make a better president
than Wall. As a result last night's meet
ing was called, the purpose being to or
ganize a fresh union with Jellnski at the
head, Ignoring Wall's organization ,en
tirely. But the latter did not propose to
bo sidetracked, and when Simpson at
tempted to call the meeting to order Wall
disputed his right to do so, claiming that
privilege for himself, as the duly elected
president of the Newsboys' Union.
The crowd yelled for .wall, but Simp
son, with the aid of the police, finally in
duced Wall to waive his claim.
Wall's friends controlled the meeting,
and as It was evident after two hours
of wrangling that nothing could be ac
complished, Chairman Simpson an
nounced that another meeting would be
held at the same place to-morrow night
and he hoped only those would come who
desired to join union No. 2, with Jellnski
as president. - .
Before the meeting adjourned Mrs. Dr.
Morse, editor of the Coming Light, spoke
of her plan to inaugurate a movement for
a sick benefit fund for the newsboys. She
said she would devote one issue of her
paper for the good of the movement and
give the boys one-half of the receipts.
As the boys filed out of the place a cob
blestone came hurling through the win
dow, smashing the glass and narrowly
missing the heads of two lads. An at
tempt will be made to exclude Wall and
his cohorts from the meeting to-morrow,
so that the organization of the new union
may be perfected without interference on
their part. â¢
After Ah Tow's Assailant.
The police of the Chinatown squad are
in hopes of locating the man who mur
derously assaulted Ah Tow in Ross al
ley Saturday night. He Is known as a
desperate highbinder, and while the po
lice are positive that he has not yet left
the city his exact whereabouts is not
known. The union of which Ah Vow is
a member promises to prosecute the
case.
RTTRAL FREE DELIVERY.
Special Agent Houpt Will Extend It
in California,
Special Agent Thomas H. Houpt of the
Postoffice Department arrived here yes
terday from Washington, D. C, and is
a guest at the California. Mr. Haupt is
one of ten special agents who are en
gaged in establishing rural free delivery
of mail throughout the United States, and
his territory embraces the Pacific States.
In discussing the question last night, Mr.
Haupt said:
"Through the earnest efforts of First
Assistant Postmaster General Heath, who
Is an enthusiast on the subject, rural free
delivery, which was an experiment four
years ago, is now an assured success.
The first appropriation for the purpose in
1896 was $10,000. It was increased to $50,000
in 1897, $150,000 in 1898 and this year it is
$300,000.
"There have been thirty-three route
established ln the section under my con
trol, and I have come' here to extend the
system. Santa Rosa has three services,
taking in thirty square miles of house to
house delivery; Napa, ono service of eight
square miles, and Petaluma, one of the
same area. An experimental star route
free delivery is also- in operation from
Redwood City to Pescadero. Santa Clara
County has eleven routes and I will es
tablish another one out of San Jose.
Santa Barbara also has one and I will
visit Gilroy, Red Bluff and Pomona to
consider applications that have been
made by those towns for the service. The
routes out of Berryessa, Pinto, West Side,
Campbells and Los Gatos are entirely suc
cessful.
"The system has given general satis
faction wherever inaugurated. Subscribe
ers to metropolitan newspapers get their
papers by mail several hours ahead of
the time "they did when they were sent
by express, and this has resulted in in
creased subscriptions. The mall carrier
is generally a local man who knows the
country and Is provided with a map of
the district. The patrons are required to
place a box alongside of the fence for
the reception of letters and in the event
of their having mail matter to send away
they display a small flag for the benefit
of tne carrier. The latter Is placed under
bonds of $500 for the faithful performance
of his duty."
Assaulted With a Knife.
Andrew Chinj?uro, a scavenger, living
at 1314 Stockton street, rushed Into the
California-street police ptriflon last night
with blood pouring from two ugly gashes
in his face. He said he went to call upon
a friend, and that the friend attempted
to rob him. In the mix-up a knife was
drawn and Chinguro was stabbed twice
in the face. Tie was sent to the Harbor
Hospital! where his injuries were
dressed. They are not of a serious na
ture.

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
-YBUJ of FIOS, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting-
them in the form most refreshing to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing fig. < -
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

"During the day I would have attacks in my spine which Involved my head and seemed to extend to all the leading nerves
ln my body. These attacks were often so sudden they made me dizzy. I lost my appetite and was disqualified for mental ef-
fort. I felt so dull and heavy In both mind and body that I lost all Interest in everything. I was moody, disheartened and
discouraged. To me the future appeared as unwholesome and discolored as my own yellow skin and eyes.
"Many people had recommended Warner's Safe Cure to me, and I made up my mind to try it. The result was beyond my
expectations or hopes. Up to that time I had been In such misery that I would alternately stand on one foot and then on the
other to ease the pain, but before I had finished the first bottle of the Safe Cure I felt a change for the better. After having
taken five bottles in allâ a time covering perhaps as many weeksâ the pain was entirely gone and I enjoyed the unspeakable
blessing of good health. From these facts, when people ask me my opinion of Warner's Safe Cure, you can imagine what my
answer Edmund Stevens Jacques, Wayne avenue, Germantown, Pa." j .___-___
Now if the reader will lend me his ears for a minute I will say a few plain words suggested by the above letter.
The complaint which gave Mr. Jacques such an unhappy experience was that form of rheumatism commonly called sciat-
ica. Few diseases are more painful and prostrating. Our friend has in no way exaggerated the torments which it la capable
of Inflicting. If the ancient Inquisitors, who sought to correct heresy by means of bodily pain, could have imposed at will the
agonies of acute rheumatism they might have spared themselves the use of the rack, the thumbscrew, the boot and others
of their amiable devices. For few men but would change their creed quicker than a wink to get rid of this variety of torture.
Now here is the point ln a nutshell: All forms of rheumatism and gout are caused by the poison known as uric acid; and
uric acid Is produced ln the system and retained there by a torpid liver. Paste this fact up on the walls of your memorj-,
where you can see it at a glance, as you are not likely to get hold of any more important information this year.
In other words, cure liver and kidney complaint and you cure rheumatism, gout, sciatica and most other kinds of nerve
pain. And the agent to do it with is Warner's Safe Cure. This shows why, as I said at the outset, Liverland is a bigger
country than India v--'" ':-"â  .

ROASTED HIS
FLOCK FOR NOT
RAISING SALARY
Now Pastor Burnett Is Out
and Union Church Is
Closed.
Death of Two Trustees Said to Be a Judg
ment on San Lorenzo for Its
Religious Indifference.
The portals of the cozy little Union Church in San Lorenzo
aTe closed indefinitely. Its pastor, Rev. E. L. Burnett, struck for
higher salary, and is now looking about for a job. His resignation,
which, according to reliable sources, was asked for by the church
trustees last January, has been hastened on account of a stinging
sermon on 'â¢Proportionate Giving" delivered by the reverend gen
tleman on Palm Sunday, wherein he intimated that the church so
ciety was ungodly, and that providence had wreaked a vengeance
upon the community by removing through death Robert Watson
and C. S. King, two of the strongest pillars and trustees of the
church. As a result, the chur* ; folks of the picturesque village are
in a fever of excitement and half suppressed indignation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 10.
The underlying secret ln the resignation
j_f Rev. E. L. Burnett as pastor of the
Union Church at San Lorenzo leaked out
â¢to-day and has created a sensation in re
ligious circles. When Rev. Mr.
'Burnett came to California nearly
three years ago to assume charge
of the pastorate at San Lorenzo
ills salary was fixed at $r>o per month.
His predecessor had received $1000 per an
mum; but the drought came along, grass
.became short and money likewise, so the
church trusteesâ Bowers, N. Mc-
Conaghy, Captain William Roberts, Pres
ton Crane, Robert Watson and C. S. King
âdeclared that $60 per month would be
the limit. However, should the church
grow, the salary was to be Increased pro
portionately.
The new pastor had brought with him
his family, comprising his wife and five
?Tbe Church That Was Closed After Its Pastor's
Search)ir)g Sern)OQ.
-laughters. They were soon ensconsed in |
f the comfortable parsonage adjoining the
â church edifice, and during the family's so
journ they have drawn about them a large
â circle of friends. The daughters are very
(popular, the two eldest attending Mills
.Seminary.
Peace and harmony were the rule in the
pastorate until a few months ago, when
Rev. Mr. Burnett began losing hopes that
his salary would ever increase. The
amount was a very material drop from
-what he had received while in charge of
A Presbyterian church In Binghamton, N.
Y. Finally losing all patience, Rev. Mr.
Burnett frequently wove into his sermons
_tljuslons to his small salary, and early In j
January last a clash came. During the
same month j.vobert Watson, one of the
church trustees, passed over to the silent
majority, and a month later another trus
tee, C. L. King, followed him to the grave.
About this time a meeting of the remain
ing trustees was called and Rev. Mr. Bur
nett presented his resignation, which was
to take effect May 1.
On Palm Sunday the pastor preached a
sermon on "Proportionate Giving." The
church was crowded and his words
"reached home.": Since then neither ho
nor any member of his family has entered
the church building. There was no dis
play of Easter bonnets on Sunday a week
ago, and yesterday there was no regular
worshiping. What Rev. Mr. Burnett ot
tered during the course of his last sermon
is best told by Mrs. C. L. King, widow of
the late trustee.
"The whole affair is the result of a
misunderstanding," said Mrs. King to
day. "You see Rev. Mr. Burnett has
looked for a raise ln salary, but the
church trustees could not see their way
cjear to grant this. So, on Palm Bun
day, the pastor took occasion to scorch
the congregation. He reprimanded the
society, and stated that God had pun
ished the community for its lack of In
terest by removing two of the main
pillars or the churchâ my husband and
Mr. Watson. He said he had been deep
,ln debt ever since coming here, owing to
his small salary.
"Of course, he had been worrying over
the matter until he was driven nearly
crazy. He is a very competent, highly
'educated man, and his family is large:
but he kept on referring to his small sal
ary in his sermons until it really be
came unpleasant and unbearable.
"So I understand the trustees met and
decided to give the pastor a month's sal
ary In advanceâ for Aprilâ give him
la month's vacation, so that he might
â¢look about for his future welfare."
Another church-goer who declined to
jglve his name states that Rev. Mr. Bur
nett had said in his last sermon that tne
society which provides the salary Is un
godly, and that Providence had punished
the community by the death of Trustees
King and Watson.
Preston Crane, who Is also clerk of the
onion Church, was reticent. He stated
that there was no trouble; that Rev. Mr.
Burnett had been a very satisfactory
pastor and that he did not know why
he had resigned. "Of course," said Mr.
Crane, "you will always find some who
take exceptions to a minister's remarks.
They hate the truth. Rev. .Mr. Burnett
Is a man of splendid character, and there
no Brown scandal here. We .lust wish to
be left alone. We gave our pastor a
month's salary in advance, together with
a month's vacation. No, we have not de
cided upon his successor."
According to a young lady, another at
tendant at Rev. Mr. Burnett's church,
"the pastor's sermon was such a scorch
er that Mr. Crane wriggled in his seat
so nervously and seemed so worked up
that he didn't know what to do."
W. M. Doyle, principal of the San Lor
enzo public school, is also a frequent vis
itor at the church. When asked why the
church held no regular services yester
day he said: "Yes, it is closed." The !
preacher is out of a job. He struck for j
higher wages. To tell the truth, he lias ]
rather run to seed."
Rev. Mr. Burnett was not at home. He j
is now enjoying his vacation, but Mrs. '
Burnett was seen and vigorously denied
there had been any dissatisfaction.
"The attitude of the congregation after
the sermon." said Mrs. Burnett, "was
pleasant and we heard of no complaints.
My husband resigned last January, and
I did not learn of this until my return
recently from the East. 1 never did want
him to stay here.
"Our church is a union church, attend
ed by people of all creeds, and by some j
who have none.
"Yes. Mr. Burnett expects to remove |
to another charge in this State. I am i
sorry to say. I do not like California, i
anyway. Its papers are too sensational,
and I have never permitted my children
to read them. We are preparing te
leave Ban Lorenzo now."

THE SA_N FKAjMOISCO CALL, TUESDAY, APRIL 11, 1899.
SHOT WHILE
MAKING LOVE
TO A WIDOW
Mrs. Curtice Lands in
Jail. ,
LEHN WAS INFATUATED
WAS TRYING TO ENTER HER
ROOM WHEN WOUNDED.
Now That He Fears Blood-Poisoning
He Has Sworn Out a Warrant
Charging a Serious
Crime.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 10.
Mrs. Lillian E. Curtice resents the ar
dent love making of Charles Lehn, a
Southern Pacific baggageman. That is
the reason she gives for being arrested
to-day and put In the City Prison.
Mrs. Curtice is a widow, and Saturday
afternoon she had occasion, she says, to
shoot at Mr. Lehn. The bullet lodged In
his leg, and as he fears blood poisoning
and possibly death he had his assailant
arrested.
Lehn and his 18-year-old daughter lodge
with Mrs. Curtice and her daughter at
IOCS Twelfth avenue. Mrs. Curtice Is an
attractive widow of middle age. Satur
day noon Lehn went to his lodgings, de
siring to have a conversation with the
widow. She declined to receive him in
her room and told him to leave or she
would shoot. He did not leave at once,
bo the lady opened the door slightly and
fired at him. The bullet plowed through
the calf of his leg. This is Lehn's story.
Mrs. Curtice says that Lehn, apparently
infatuated with her, was trying to force
an entrance to her room. She warned
him to desist, telling him she had a load
ed gun for Intruders. Lehn did not de
sist. "He went to the kitchen and re
turned with a knife, with which he cut
the cord fastening the folding doors.
Again 1 warned him to go away, but he
kept on, and then 1 shot through an
opening ln the door. I did not try to kill
htm, for I aimed only at his hand. The
bullet struck the walnscoating and de
flected, so that it had not much force
when it struck Lehn. The only reason I
kept him was because he paid for his
board and room regularly, and his daugh
ter was a companion for us."
This morning Lehn, who had previous
ly told Sergeant Scanlon that he would
not prosecute, as he wished to avoid no
toriety, appeared at the Police Court and
charged the widow with assault with a
deadly weapon. There were no witnesses
to the shooting, and consequently no evi
dence except the testimony of the love
lorn baggageman and the widow.
WATER COMPANIES
TO MEET TODAY
DINGEE AND ROSE WILL BE
ELECTED DIRECTORS.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
.;' :â ..Â«. â¢;. 908 Broadway, April 10.
To-morrow the most important annual
meeting- ln the history of the Contra
Costa Water Company will be held. At
this meeting a new board of directors will
be elected and the new Oakland Water
Company will formally die.
The new beard of directors Is in doubt.
There is no programme simply because
there cannot be owing to the mystery
which attache, to the ownership of large
block- of the shares, which have recent
ly changed hands. The stock market for
the past few months has shown that on
an average of 100 shares a day has been
sold, and if all these little blocks have
been cerraled by one interest, it may en
tirely change the complexion of the
board of directors when It is voted to
morrow.
It is agreed upon at present that W. J.
Dlngee and his business associate, Mr.
Rose, shall have place, on the board, of
which there are seven members. It is
believed that Henry Pierce will he re
elected president and J. H.i T. Watkinson
manager.
The terms of the consolidation have
been already published, and there is not
a shade of doubt but that everything re
garding the combination will go through
according to programme. The new stock
to be issued to Mr; Dingee and Mr. HayÂ«
ward Will be ready by the Ist of May, at
which date one or the other of the two
water companies' offices will be closed
and all the business will be done across
the street: c '

The Vanderbilts have secured ln this
city a western terminal to their lately
-.ought transcontinental railway sys
tem. By a deal consummated in New
JYork City on the sth of the present
ouonth they secured of Behrend Joost
and his associates the rights of way
and the franchises of the West Shore
"Railway from San Francisco to Santa
Cruz via Colma and Pescadero, and for
'some weeks past they have had prac
tical control of the Monterey-Fresno
line from Monterey to Fresno through
the Coast Range via Walker Pass.
"From Fresno a connection with the
â¢road they are now building from Salt
!__ake City to Los Angeles is simply a
ixnatter of laying ties and tracks.
Not alone is the Santa Fe to stand in
(competition with the Southern Pacific
Â«of Kentucky, and nearly every other
; State of the Union. Not alone is the
(Santa Fe to take up for the man of the
Jioe and the man of the mills of Cali
fornia the competitive fight for rates
and profits and the fair living that the
soil of this State should render its
every tiller. Against the capital and
"brains of C. P. Huntington, the monop
olist, are set the brains and capital of
the Vanderbilts, those multi-millionaires
of the East who have builded world-fa
mous fortunes by open fighting and fair
competition, and it is now no more than
the time required to fill with track and
prosperous stations the two gaps that
exist before San Francisco will be send
ing Its drays and its clerks to receive
the cargoes hauled in under the steam
of the second competing road.
The negotiations that resulted in the
-leal of the sth inst. were opened some
six weeks previous to the late visit of
the numerous Vanderbilt parties to
this coast. Simultaneous with their ar
rival here came a representative of the
."Vanderbilts' New York agents, Free
man & Jones, of 51 Broad street, New
York. Laden with the field notes of the
numerous surveys that have been
made, provided him by Behrend Joost,
he traveled and inspected the route of
the proposed road from this city to
'Santa Cruz.
Not only did he look into the feasibil
ity of the road itself, but he investi
gated thoroughly the income-producing
capacity of the country which it taps.
The redwood forests that surround
Pescadero and the dairies and farms,
the most extensive outside the San
Joaquin Valley and more fertile than
they, impressed him at sight, and his
favorable observations he communi
cated directly to the Vanderbilts dur
ing their much-written-of stay at Del
-Monte.
Communication between them and
their New York agents at once ensued.
Through General W. H. H. Hart, who
has long been their advising atttorney
on this coast, Behrend Joost was ap
proached and through him the rest of
the West Shore Company. Joost and
his confreres were in a proper state of
mind to talk business on business prin
ciples. For more years than history
cares to tell of it the completion of the
coast road to Santa Cruz has been
Joost's annual dream. Late in '97 he
had got all of his rights of way. There
â¢were some stickers alone the route and
they held out for stiff prices, but popu
lar pressure finally had Its effect and
the May was clear for a seventy-min
ute competing track to the seaside city.
Then Joost and the company discov
ered either that they did not have or
did not care to risk the money the road
and its rolling stock would cost Quietly
the deal was called off and Joost came
on the market to sell his franchise.
It was valuable and worth the price
he asked and more. Besides the clear
Tights of way about $65,000 had been ex
pended In grading a roadbed over the
most difficult portion of the proposed
route, a strip of beach at Waddell
Creek, twenty-two miles from Santa
Cruz. Add to this the fact that the line
extended from San Francisco's water
front at a point south of Islais Creek
â¢up the creek and out of the county by
â¢way of Colma, and ran thence to San
Pedro Point and along the coast
through seventy miles of the grandest
marine scenery that California boasts,
and Mr. Joost had probably as market
able a piece of property as could be
found waiting a purchaser.
But the market was timid of Mr.
Joost. At the mention of his name on
the street it held up its financial skirts
like an old dame at a mouse. In Its
prejudice lt was blinded to one of Its
best opportunities and finally the west
shore line was hawked over the streets
and offered for anything to anybody.
Then the Vanderbilts got their Salt
Lake line on the way to Los Angeles
builded as far along as the little min
ing town of Ploche, over In Nevada.
Three months ago the papers told of
a mysterious surveying party that had
been laying out Its line and driving its
significant little red-topped pegs Into
the shifting sands of the deserts be
tween the thirst-stricken Nevada line
snd the orange groves of tho southern
city; and they told further of an agent,
of whom no one knew or would tell,
who went along ahead of them and
bought up or secured rights-of-way
over the country to be surveyed. All
was done quietly and without ostenta
tion. Not the cleverest correspondent
could get a line on the story and it
remained as much a mystery until to
day when back from New York came
the contract that made it all as plain
as day.
By its terms the Vanderbilts assume
cf Behrend Joost and his fellow-stock
holders the entire right of way of the
West Shore Railroad Company from
San Franicsco's water front via Islals
Creek, Colma, Halfmoon Bay and Pes
cadero to Santa Cruz. In return they
guarantee to grade and build the road,
establish stations and equip with such
rolling stock as the traffic may demand.
This for the present and for this end
of the line.
The visit of the Vanderbilts to Del
Monte, however, developed the fact
that the West Shore transaction was to
be merely incidental to the main propo
sition. They were not looking for a
mere source of pastime in Pacific Coast
finance, but under the guise of a rol
licking pleasure trip were seeking out
a western end, and a means of getting
to it, to that petty hobby, recently real
ized, of Mr. Vanderbilt's, his transcon
tinental road.
Their trip to Monterey was not so
much to gather sea mosses and catch
perch from the end of the one lone
wharf as to inspect the dock and ter
minal facilities of the proposed Mon
terey and Fresno Railroad.
Over that line the rights-of-way and
franchises have also been clear and the
road bandied back and forth across the
market since '96. It leads from Mon
terey to the heart of the San Joaquin
by the most direct route, Walker Pass,
and from there a connection with the
Salt Lake-Los Angeles road is an easy
possibility at almost any point on the
desert, and, for the most part, over
Government land.
Upon equally good authority it is said
that the Vanderbilts have secured, on
practically the same agreement, the en
tire line of the last named road.
Between the terminal of the West
Shore line at Santa Cruz and the Mon
terey-Fresno line, there is a gap of
forty-four miles extending round Mon
terey Bay, which is covered by neither
franchise nor rights-of-way. but the
people of that section have been for so
long going into debt to C. P. Hunting
ton for their tree slips and seeds, that
an easy road is open to the agent of
the Vanderbilts now working in that
section.
It was rumored that they were nego
tiating with the Spreckels people for
the narrow-gauge road now owned by
them from the prosperous city of
Watsonville to that equally thriving
burg, Salinas, but this John D. Spreck
els denies, and states that he will main
tain that road solely as an adjunct to
the Spreckels beet-sugar interests in
that locality and as an agent for the
further building up of the two coun
ties. There are two or three routes,
however, other than that occupied by
the Spreckels line by which Monterey
or Salinas may be reached, and the
agent for the Vanderbilts In this city.
General Hart, anticipates no trouble in
acquiring one of them.
The acquisition of Santa Cruz and
Monterey as stations on their line will
give the Vanderbilts an equal shipping
advantage with the Southern Pacific.
The two cities command the opposite
boundary points of Monterey Bay,
which is, even in heaviest weather, an
Ideal anchorage and only a short haul
from this city. The advantage will be
with the Vanderbilts for the reason
that their route along the coast is over
an hour shorter than either of the
Southern's Pacific's present lines and
will cost, comparatively, nothing in
maintenance.
The contract which binds all this
and makes of an airy possibility a cast
iron assurance that the Santa Fe and
Valley roads in their combination are
to have the weight of independent mil
lions and fair, open principle with them
in their fight against the relentless and
dollar-marked tyranny of the Southern
Pacific. With California's new and
splendid opportunities in the Orient is
to work jointly the facility of competi
tive transportation from the markets
of the whole country and the document
received yesterday puts these possibili
ties beyond the grasp and greed of C
P. Huntington.
It was signed in this city for the
West Shore Railway Company on
March 25 by R. S. Thornton, the presi
dent, and by R. J. Willats, the secre
tary. Then It was forwarded to New
York and signed by Freeman & James
agents for the Vanderbilts, on the sth
inst, It guarantees to the stockholders
that the New York people shall fully
equip the road with modern steel
bridges, track and rolling stock, and
that they, the shareholders, shall par
ticipate proportionately to the amount
of their stock in the only company in
the new concern.
General Hart, who holds the contract
cannot speak to a certainty but says
he Is authoritatively Informed that ac
tive work will be begun within the next
sixty days. '

dry goods store, and exhibiting' a bright
five-dollar gold piece said: 8

lish being a commission merchant at
Clay and Davis streets, and Mr. Zam
mitt having but recently closed out a
similar business. As a consequence of
the publication in The Call, the pros
pective bonanza kings have been guyed
unmercifully by their acquaintances,
but, conscious of their superior knowl
edge of sand dunes and relying
on the extent of the ledge uncovered
and the assays received from it, they
have stood the chaffing good-naturedly
and bided their time. Now they seem
to be certain of themselves and talk
and are going to work as If, as Zam
mitt says, "It is just like picking gold
up on the streets."
"We have discovered not only a mine
but a bonanza," said English yester-
"Papa gave me this to buy something
all for myself." .
She made her own selections of some
ribbons and goods for a frock, paid her
money and received her change with
childish satisfaction and proudly left the
store. The little girl saw her father fall
after he had driven his cruel dirk-knife
through her mother's heart and turned
the blade upon himself. Now the child
abhors the trinkets she purchased with
her father's gift and will not even handle
the silver coins that were given to her. in
change. - -;
No autopsy. will be held on the remains
of the deceased. Coroner Mehrman made
a casual examination of the bodies yes
terday and stated that the cause of death
was so apparent that an autopsy was not
necessary. Any one of the five gaping
wounds in the woman's back was suffi
cient to cause death. They are deep,
ghastly cuts, three of them penetrating
the heart. Four of the five strokes. Yon
Schmidt directed at himself reached a
vital spot, and it Is the opinion of physi
cians who examined his remains that he
literally hacked his heart to pieces.
It is learned that since his di
vorce troubles Yon Schmidt withdrew
from all the fraternal orders to which
he belonged except the Society of Cali
fornia Pioneers.
As an evidence of the man's violent
temper it is stated that he has frequently
threatened the life of his sister, Mrs.
Charles L. Tilden, and on one occasion
made her kneel before him and look down
the barrels of a loaded shotgun which he
held before her with the hammers at full
cock.
The Inquest will be held to-night at the
office of Deputy Coroner James Fowler.

upon to give her version or the tragedy.

Dr. Zabala reported to Coroner Hill yes

her death from chronic gastritis coupled
with dilation of the heart. She had suf

was thought at first that death was
caused from eating mushrooms at the

by the police upon the belief of the
woman's husband, but the story was ex
ploded by the statement of the restaurant
proprietor In yesterday's Call to the effect

day. "Considering the nature of the
ore and the nearness of the ledge to
the city, we are nothing short of mill
ionaires. After removing three feet of
sand we struck the quartz, which, on
its surface, assayed $6 to the ton. At
four feet depth the assay value of the
rock was $11 52.
"The ledge on the surface is fifteen
feet wide. At eight feet deep it nar
rows to ten feet and at thirty feet it
may narrow to a mere line or it may
widen again to fifteen or thirty feet.
As we descend the quartz becomes
harder and harder, which leads us to
believe that free gold will be found at,
say, twenty feet. By soundings which
we have made we know the â¢ ledge,
which runs almost due north and
south, extends from the point of dis
covery six or seven hundred feet
northward to the ocean. The ledge has
been traced also for some distance to
the sputh of the discovery."
The faith of English and Zammitt
in the bonanza was attested yester
day, when they sent out to the place a
sand pump in order to carry off the
water, which has covered the bottom
of the hole. It was being placed in po
sition when a reporter for The Call
reached the ground by Harry Ost
waldt, who. If a bonanza really is
concealed in the sands, will have the
honor. of sharing the original discov
ery with Zammitt. He is camped
within twenty feet of the discovery
shaft in a wall tent, which he has
shared, ever since the first pick was
struck in the ground, with Zammitt,
who Is an old prospector.
To the lay eye, the hole in the
sand dunes has not the look of an en
trance of a Golconda. It is a ragged
looking rent, about ten feet long, in
as forsaken a spot as there is on the
peninsula. Wild strawberry plants,
wilder jackrabbits and an unclassified
collection of doodlebug constitute the
flora and fauna. There are no trails
for the reason that a footprint In the "
sand lasts no longer than the coming
of the first breath from the ocean. To
get to the. place one has to trust more
to instinct than intelligence and even
that would be at fault in a day when
the fog rolls in. With all these disad

think it Is. They certainly have had
