The new corporation, which enters
the local field a? a direct and avowed
competitor of the electric light com
pany .now enjoying public patronage,
will be known as ihe Independent Elec
tric Light and Power Company. The
capital stock of this company, accord
irur. to the artic'ey .of incorporation
which -were filed at the office of the
County Clerk yesterday, is $10,00
divided into 100.000 shares of a par
value of $100 each. The company Is or
ganized for a period of fifty years and,
according' to the articles of incorpora
tion, is estabiir-hed to supply electric
light, heat and power and telephone
facilities. The directors for the first
year are Claus Spreckels, John D.
Spreckels, Adolph B. Spreckels, Charles
A. Hujr and W. D. K. Gibson. As soon
as articles of incorporation have been
granted by the Secretary of State these
directors will meet for permanent or
ganization. It is understood that Claus
Spreckels will be chosen president of
the company.
This gigantic corporation, the exist
ence of which is intended to relieve the
city from the oppressive taxation of a
monopoly, will then be formally organ
ized. In a few days application will be
made to the Secretary of State for a
charter. On Monday next the Super
visor? of this city will be asked to
grant the new company a franchise to
operate within the limits of the city.
There is practically no question that
both, charter and franchise will be
granted by the authorities and then the
active work of preparation will begin.
. The plant of the new electric light i
company will be one of the most elab
orate of its kind in the world. It will
be constructed with the double object of :
Securing the greatest effectiveness at
the least possible cost. It will be mod
eled upon the b< st municipal plants in
the world, and will have all their best
features with none of their defects. It
will be built with a view of supplying
every householder in San Francisco
electric light, heat and power at rates j
far below those which are now charged '
by" the local monopoly. The expert who
has been at work upon the matter has
not yet finished his labors. He will i
without delay make a visit to Eastern j
cities to study their electric light sys- j
tern, adapt their best features and use
them in the construction -of the new
plant. â¢As soon as his investigations I
have been completed actual work upon
the buildings will begin.
The site of thp new electric plant will
be upon thÂ« hay shore, where access
to water and coal will be easy and far
less expensive than it the works were
located in the town. This choice of lo
cation will greatly reduce the cost of
production, although the promoters and
organizers of the new corporation are
convinced that electric light, heat and
power may be furnished, without the
advantage of a bay shore site, much
cheaper than is now done by the local
monopoly, which holds the' local field in
its power. It is estimated that the new
company will be able to fix a rate one
half as great as that established by the
controlling company.
When the new company asks the Su
soris for a franchise to operate
within the limits of the city a promise
will be given to -use nothing but an un
round system of wires and con
for the Mectric and telephone
plant. The dangerous and altogether
unnecessary system of overhead wires
â  not be employed. Only the latest
and most improved appliances will be
â¢used in the plant and its accessories.
As -,;nn as the Supervisors have Riven

gantic scheme will commence. Some

heat and power within his reach and
his means.
The promoters of the new enterprise
vindicate the organization of the corpo
ration in the fact that the people of the
city are now being charged grossly ex
orbitant rates for what has become a
public necessity. The new company in
organized with a purpose of giving a
better service for a much less cost and
of endowing the city with a public util
ity that will have no superior, if it has
any equals, in the great cities of tin
world.
The articles of incorporation, which
were filed yesterday afternoon with the
County Clerk, are as follows:

SUPPRESSED STORY
OF FIGHT ON THE
ISLAND OF NEGROS
Mac Arthur Advances His Line and Agui
naldo Has Moved His Capital
to San Fernando.
SINGAPORE, March 29. â Trouble is brewing in the island of Negros, where the inhab
itants repudiate the self-constituted authority of Aniseto Lacson. president of the provincial
government, to arrange affairs with the Americans, and have attacked the Americans.
The censor at Manila suppressed the details.
The insurgents in Luzon sent a message to Lieutenant Commander Cowper of the British
gunboat Plover, when the latter endeavored to effect a compromise, suggesting that they were
ready to treat for peace through a neutral great power.
MANILA, March 28.âInforma
tion has reached hf re that indi
cates that the insurgent capital
has been moved from Malolos to San
Fernando.
The army has not advanced to
day.
The men are building bridges and
waiting for supplies to come up. The
insurgents burned Balucan this af
ternoon. American marines are pa
trolling Malahon. One hundred and
fifty prisoners were brought into
Manila to-day.
The monitor ;Monadnoek shelled Las
Pinas south of the city at noon. The
lines are hi inp strengthened at Pasay
and some Bring is going on in th^ vi
cinity of that place.
When General MacArthuf's force pn-

The engineers are repairing bridges,
the rebels having failed to destroy the
iron work, and tho railroad is kept busy
hurrying supplies to the front.
The heat is intense, being 90 degrees
on the coast and fully 100 degrees In
the interior, and the Americans suffer
h great deal. In spite of the heat, how
over, every man is eager to proceed
toward the enemy.
The country to Malolos is level, with
occasional streams and patches of
wood, but there are no more jungles.
The American troops will advance at
daylight, taking four days' rations with
them and having 200 rounds of am
munition in their belts. They expect
to take Bocave, on the railroad to the
east of Balucan, to-morrow. It is a
difficult position, protected by streams.
The American line is about 1200 yards
from that of the rebels.
Desultory shots were exchanged to
day. The American reports show that
twenty men were killed and sixty-one
wounded on our side yesterday. The
Dakota regiment lost ten men killed
and had thirty-seven wounded.
One of the most brilliant and costly
achievements of the campaign was the
charge of Major Howard's battalion
across the river. Advancing at the
double-quick they found the river be
neath them and splashed across with a
yell, swimming and wading, with bul
lets spattering in the water, and rushed
upon the rebel trenches. Ten men were
killed and eleven were wounded in the
charge.
At the rapture of Marilao there were
several incidents showing the bravery
of our troops. Some Filipinos were in

river. The Americans approached in a

ILOIL.O, March 28.â James Macleod,
representative of Warder, Barnes

Pavia yesterday, intending to Bee"
the leaders and endeavor" to ar
range an amicable settlement. He met
with an excellent reception from the
native rank and file, but Pablo Arrata
refused to receive him until informed
whether he came officially as the rep
tative of the Amrican authorities.
Macleod replied he came in an un

the white flap:, many of them attempted
to run and several were shot for so
doing.
In the churchyard of Marilao the
Americans found thirty newly made
graves of Filipinos and a dozen bodies
wore seen floating down the river with
grewsome wounds. Many huts are
smoking ruins, having been burned by
their inhabitants. The Americans are
not burning any buildings.
Our troops captured four Spaniards
who were fighting with the insurgents.
General Mac Arthur was under a heavy
fire yesterday.
A detachment of ninety-six Filipino
prisoners was escorted into Manila to
day. Their appearance aroused great
interest as "they were marched from
the railroad depot to the prison.
The rebels have unloaded about 500
men from a train half a mile from Gen
eral Mac Arthur's forces, with the ob
ject of reinforcing the Filipino garri
sons at Balucan and Guiguinto, on
either side of the railroad leading to
Malolos.
The fact that the railroad is in oper
ation from here to our front facilitates
the transportation of supplies to the
troops. Before the break in the road
was repaired the transportation of sup
plies was very uncertain.
All is quiet in front of the lines of
Generals Ovenshine and Hall.
The United States gunboat Yorktown
has arrived here with the Spanish
steamer Mundara, owned by the Men

steamer, a filibuster, was captured
after a stiff chase in the Gulf of Lin

first sighted the Mundara was enter

seaward. The Yorktown fired two
shots before the steamer was over

WILL OFFER
AMNESTY TO
THE REBELS
The United States Not to
Seek Vengeance Upon
the Filipinos.
THEY MUST BE BEATEN
When Aguinaldo Is Taken, or a
Fugitive, All Will Be
Forgiven.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 2S.â The Her
ald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: As soon as General Otis
achiev. s a decisive victory over Apjuin
aldo, the Philippine Commission will
Issue a proclamation promising amnes
ty to- all natives who lay down their
arms, and self rule to those who recosr
nize the sovereignty of the United
States.
This is the programme which the
Department understands has
been adopted by the commission. As
General Otis and Admiral Dewey are
members of the commission, it is pre
sumed here that they are responsible
for the delay in issuing the proclama
tion, believing its effects will be greater
if published after the insurgents have
been subdued.
An official with whom I talked re
garding the course of the commission
{tainted out that so long as Aguinaldo
maintained his army organization it
would be difficult to reach the natives
and convince them, but with Aguinaldo
a prisoner or a fugitive and his army
disbanded, it is thought the proclama
tion will receive attention from the
natives and cause them to take ad
vantage of its provisions.
The proclamation will be similar to
.those previously issued by General Otis

ENGLAND PATS THE:
BACK OF AMERICANS
â¢ LONDON, March 28.â The Times,
an editorial commenting upon a sug
gestion thrown out by the New York
Times regarding the birth of a feeling
of respect for the Filipinos says:
"The growth of such a sentiment
does honor to the Americans so long as
their respect is confined to bravery and
endurance and no inference is drawn
from the military to the civic capaci
ties of the natives.
"Until the Filipinos are vanquished
and forced to sue for peace any talk of
concessions is liable to be misconstrued
and to lead to a prolongation of the
struggle. That, at least, is the teach
ing of English history in dealing with
semi -civilized races.
"The Americans evidently have a
tough job, and it may be they have a
long one. but we do not doubt they will
do it thoroughly and in a workmanlike
fashion, as is their national way."
The Daily Chronicle this morning
â prints extracts from a letter wFitten by
a distinguished British naval officer re
cently In Philippine waters, who di
lates upon the difficulties facing the
-Americans there.
The writer, whose name is not given,
says that the climate is very trying for
.nine months of the year and that it is
quite impossible ' for whites to live
there. The Americans, he declares, lack
mule batteries and horses to move their
<artillery. He is confident that the
Americans â¢'would prefer to clear out."
but explains that "they cannot do this
because of the foreign merchants."
Thf officer also remarks: "The
Americans do not appear to understand
the game of using one lot of natives
against another. If they wish to con
quer the islands they must adopt that
plan and also, make roads and rail
ways."
AGUINALDO WILLING
TO ACCEPT AUTONOMY
NEW YORK, March 2f.â A special
cable to the Sun from London says:
The London agent of the Filipinos has
gone to Paris with Losada, one of the
recently arrived representatives of
Aguinaldo. to confer with Agoneillo.
Previous to his departure the agent
said Aguinaldo was willing to accept
autonomy similar to that of the British
native Indian states, which are nomi
nally self-governed under British con
trol. The religious tithe r-uestion, he
said, was one of the principal incent
ives to the rebellion of the Filipinos,
who believed that the Americans would
confirm and approve the Spanish
monks' system of squeezing contribu
tions out of the peasantry. The Filipi
nos, he added, were willing to negotiate
terms of surrender with Admiral
Dewey, but never with General Otis.

SERGEANT COHEN FALLS
FIGHTING AT MALINTA
Sergeant Morris J. Cohen of Company B, Twentieth Kansas Regiment,
who was killed while fighting before Malinta, was a resident of San Fran
cisco and enlisted in his regiment while it was stationed here. He had
many friends in the city and his death is greatly mourned by all who knew
him.
Cohen was born in New York "Pity in 1562 and the greater part of his
early life was spent there and in Jersey City. He was always interested in
military matters and several years ago organized the Cohen Guards in Jer
sey City and was captain of the organization. The accompanying picture
shows him in the uniform of the guards. He had served in the regular army
for eight years and at the outbreak of the Spanish-American war sought to
enlist in the First California Regiment, but owing *to the large number of
recruits who presented themselves was unable to secure a berth in the regi
ment from his own State. When the Twentieth Kansas Regiment came to
San Francisco Cohen enlisted in Company B. His excellent qualities as a
soldier soon came to the notice of his officers and he was made a corporal
before the regiment left for Manila. After reaching the Philippines he was
given a sergeant's chevrons.
About five years ago Cohen came to the coast and was employed for
some time by the Burglar Alarm Company. He returned to New York for
a visit and when he again came back to San Francisco he obtained a po
sition with the Morse Patrol, which he held until he resigned to join the
army. When John Dow, who was murdered on Kearny street over a year
ago, had been missing for several days Cohen, who was a friend of Dow,
climbed through the transom of Dow's shooting gallery and found his body.
He was an important witness at the inquest and his testimony helped to
prove that a murder had been committed when the police asserted that
Dow had killed himself.
The dead soldier leaves a brother living here and a sister and an aged
grandmother in New York. He was respected by his friends and held the
confidence of his employers.

SPANISH HELP REBELS
One Ship Comes to Grief Through

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 28.â A special to
the Journal from Washington says:
Admiral Dewey has cabled to the de
partment for more men and more ships.
It is believed to mean simply a deter
mination to put into execution a plan
more thoroughly to patrol the island
and prevent filibustering expeditions
from landing.
WASHINGTON, March 28.â At the
Navy Department, up to the close of
office hours, nothing official had been
received concerning the achievement
of the Yorktown in capturing a Spanish
merchantman in the Gulf of Lingayen.
1 While the dispatch is silent as to the
: reason for the capture, it is surmised
that it was due to her carrying contra
band of war. This is apparently borne
out by the fact that the gulf lead 3to
the terminus of the railway which, in
turn, leads to the insurgent capital of
Malolos. It is further borne out by the
fact of the capture itself, which would
hardly be attempted against a neutral
, merchant ship, unless for serious rea
i sons. Spain is now practically in the
; position of a neutral, so that her mer
| chant ships have immunity from cap
! ture, unless there is good foundation
: for the belief that aid and comfort is
being- given to the enemy. The last
| information from Dewey as to the
Yorktown came yesterday, when he
stated that the gunboat was cruising
> off Luzon.

NEW YORK, March 28.â A Waph
ington dispatch to the Journal says:
Because' of the situation in the Philip-
pine Islands the army probably will be
: increased to the full limit allowed by
; the army reorganization bill. A call
i for 35,000 volunteers seems certain to be
: issued by the President. With a pro

: army of 35.000 Uncle Sam will have a
j force of 100.000 fighting men.
Soon after the President reached the
White House, Secretary Hay, Attorney
General Griggs, Secretary Hitchcock,
Secretary Wilson and Secretary Gage
arrived. Acting Secretary of War
Meiklejohn met the President at the
railroad station and accompanied him
to the White House, on the way giving
him the news from Manila.
It was the opinion of Acting Secre
tary Meiklejohn, in which other mem
bers of the Cabinet agreed, that the
military forces in the Philippines must
be strengthened at once. In this view
the President concurred.
. At least 50,000 soldiers will be neces
sary in the Philippines to insure the
complete assertion of American author
ity. An additional 20,000 men will be
sent to the islands as rapidly as pos
ble; other regiments are to follow the
six regiments now under orders as
soon as transports can be secured.
President McKjnley and the Cabinet
members met this evening and agreed
it would be necessary to issue a call
for the 35,000 volunteers provided for in
the reorganization bill.

The Lynched Man a Fanner Who At
tempted to Shoot His Sweet
heart, but Killed Her
Aunt.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TOPEKA, Kans., March 28.â A spe
cial to the State Journal from Holton,
Kans., says: Henry Sanderson, the
young farmer who attempted to murder
his sweetheart, Myrtle Fleischer, near
Mayetta, on Sunday afternoon, but in
stead wounded M-- John Fleischer,
her aunt, who was at her side, so that
she died at 2 o clock this morning, was
lynched this morning by a mob from
Mayetta.
Although nominally in Sheriff George
N. Hass' hands, Sanderson was under
the guard of one man in a back room
of Nate Haver's restaurant. This was
for two reasons: During Sanderson's
attempt to escape, immediately after
the shooting of " Mrs. Fleischer, he
started to extract some shells from hia
Winchester and one accidentally ex
ploded, shattering his right arm. Again,
there had been a jail delivery at Hol
ton the previous night and the prison
was not considered safe.
At 2 o'clock this morning Nate Haver,
keeper of the restaurant, alone on night
duty, was surprised by two men armed
with revolvers, Â»'ho demanded Sander
son. At the same moment men burst
in the back door of the restaurant. The
single guard was paralyzed with fear
and made no resistance. Sanderson
was lying in bed asleep, but was
awakened by the noise. Without a
protest Sanderson arose and partially
dressed. The mob, with Sanderson,
marched to Banner Creek, tied a rope
around his neck and fastened the other
end to a beam of the bridge. They
then gave him a kick off the bridge,
and after a few convulsive jerks San
derson was dead. His neck was dis
jointed by the fall of twelve feet and
death must have come almost instantly.
The mob. then quietly dispersed.
The body was cut down by Sheriff
Hass at 5 o'clock this morning and
taken to a Ideal undertaking establish
ment, where it lies awaiting disposition
by relatives. None of the mob are
known by the officials.

WORDS ARE SENT
ACROSS THE SEA
WITHOUT A WIRE
London Times Prints the First
Message Flashed From the
French to the English Coast.
LONDON, March 29.â Gugllelmo
Marconi, the inventor, who recently,
after long delay, obtained permission
from the French Government to estab
lish a station on the French coast for
the purpose of experimenting with
wireless telegraphy between England
and France, announces that he has
conducted successful experiments be
tween the South Foreland, county of
Kent, and Boulogne at the mouth of
the Lianne.
The Times this morning prints a hun
dred word dispatch, the first press mes
sage by the Marconi system of wire
less telegraph describing the experi
ments between the South Foreland and
Boulogne. The experiments were con
ducted with the Morse code, which was
read as distinctly as if the termini had
been connected with wires.
The South Foreland is the most east
erly land in England, consisting of a
chalky cliff about 200 feet in heUht.
projecting into tho North Sea and hav
ing two lighthouses, with an eleva
tion of 572 feet. Marconi's system ct
wireless telegraphy has been In practi
cal operation off the English coaÃt for
several months between tho South
Foreland lighthouse and tho Cast
Goodwin lightship, a distance or twelve
miles. The distance from Souih Fore
land lighthouse to Boulogn-.-Sur-M 't
is thirty-two miles, the greatest previ
ous distance covered having been eigh
teen miles, between Poole and Bourne
mouth, in England.
An experience of fourteen montns has
shown that no kind of weather would
stop thf working of his apparatus.
The vertical conductor used is the main
feature of the system, and Marconi has
found that the distance to which sig
nals may be sent varies according to
the square of the length of this con
ductor. For signaling eighteen miles
he used a conductor eighty feet high

Cooper Named Attorney
General.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLULU. March 21.â Henry E.
Cooper is Attorney General of Hawaii.
His commission was delivered to him
yesterday morning and at 10 o'clock
he was sworn in by Chief Justice Judd.
President Dole announced to his Cab
inet Ministers at the morning session
that Mr. Cooper had been appointed
Attorney General, and that his com
mission was ready.
President Dole will now have to ap
point a Minister of Foreign Affairs to

to have F. M. Hatch take the position.
Mr. Hatch was formerly Hawaiian
Minister at Washington.
B. F. Dillingham has almost com

plantation project on Kauai. This
scheme will be worked differently from
any of its predecessors, and anything
like speculating in the stock ahead of
time will be shut off. As now arranged
the books will be open for subscriptions
on Monday and kept open for a week.
This fact will be advertised in the
papers. Each application for stock
must be accompanied by a check for
one-tenth of the amount asked for. At
the end of the time the stock will be
awarded pro rata, the excess of assess
ment paid being returned to the sub
scribers. This plan may be altered
slightly, but the general scheme will
be carried out on precisely these lines.
The stock market has shown a de

the month. There have been advances
all along the line. Practically every
sugar stock has felt it. In some stoekf
where there has not been a sale at ad

LADY RANDOLPH CHURCHILL
AND HER MAGAZINE
Special Cable t.i The Call and th* N>w York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1^99, by James Gor
don Bennett.
LONDON, March 28.â "1t will be Anglo-
Saxon in contents as well as in name."
In these words t. t very popular Anglo-
Saxon, Lady Randolph Churchill, broad
ly outlined to The Call-Herald corre
spondent to-day the policy of the new
quarterly miscellany which will appear
in June simultaneously in London and
New York, of which she is the sole pro
prietor as well as the editor.
"The contributors who have already
signified their willingness to aid i the
making of the quarterly comprise .states
men, poets, novelists and essayists la
Great Britain, the Tnited States and the
colonies, and in time I hope to secure
contributions from some of the l.esr
known French writers, hut the writers
whose work will appear will not always
be the bearers of distinguished, well
known names, for we hope that room will
often be found for comparatively un
known writers of talent or promlae," she
said. "As to the list or contributors to
the first number. I would much prefer no!
to mention their namt-s just now, hut
there will be n poem by a well-known
writer, and I may tell you that admirers
of John Oliver Hubbes. .urs. Cralgto, will
have an opportunity of reading some
thing from her clever pen."
and Jn his application to M. Lockroy
he contended that with a conductor 114
feet high he could establish communi
cation between points on oPt> OÃlt * s t 'Â£^
of the Strait of Dover and even go that
distance ten miles better. â 
His experiments have already pro\en
that when such a vertical wire or con
ductor is employed no hindrance to sig
naling is caused by hills or other obsta
cles or by the curvature of the earth.
One of his most interesting and valu
able experiments was the installation
fitted up last autumn between Osborne
House, lie of Wight, and the royal
yacht, 'on which the Prince of Wales was
recuperating after his accident. This
gave an opportunity to study the effect
of intervening hills, and as vhe yacht
moved about to various positions
doubts were set at rest as to the pos
sibility of telegraphing across kng
stretches of land. Communication be
tween lightships and shore is a matter
of great importance and the J**eieÃ9
system between South Foreland light
house and East Goodwin lightship
worked through the fierce storms of the
hit tor end of February without inter
ruption, the messages being flashed
continually from ship to shore and vice
% Signor Marconi is much the most suc
cessful experimenter among the many
who have worked along the same lines.
He is now in his twenty-sixth year.
He is an Italian and it was in Italy
that he began his special work. The
Italian Government paid him a l^rge
sum of money for his Invention, to b-3
used on warships. From Italy he went
to EnglanÃ and his success there has
already interested Emperor William,
who has instructed German experts to
experiment with the wireless system
for the benefit of the German army and.
navy. He recently, in the course of a
lecture on the system, illus'rated its
principle by likening it to that upon
which a tuning fork will respond to
vibrations caused by striking another
tuning fork near it.
UNION BANK IN A
HOPELESS TANGLE
Legal Complications Are
Multiplying.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March 2S.â The recent
court decision in regard to the board
of directors of the Union Savings Bank
has not straightened the legal en
tanglement surrounding those officials.
Instead it has mixed matters, and un
til the legality of all directors has been
passed upon again there will be one
too many in the directorate. All this
trouble arises over Charles P. Braslan,
the representative of the Union Trust
Company of San Francisco, who claims
to be a regularly appointed director of
the institution. He was elected to fill
a vacancy on the board just after the
failure. He refused to resign when the
rest of the board retired, but Judge
Lorigan appointed a full board of
seven. Braslan applied to the Supreme
Court for relief, but the case was be
fore the court irregularly and was dis
misstd. Now he proposes to go into
court again on the came question.
A meeting of the board of directors
was held to-day. Braslan was present,
and was recognized as a director by
President. Rea and his name entered in
the minutes of the meeting as such.
He joined in all the discussions. This
complicates matters and the court
will have to decide which of the
eight directors illegally hold office.
The directors adopted a resolution that
they were ready to accept the bank's
business for settlement. It is expected
the commissioners will be here to-rrtor
row to turn over the affairs of the bank
to the directors. Another meeting will
be held Thursday morning.
Braslan is receiving considerable en
couragement in his efforts from Direc
tors Callisch, Eaton and Jones. After
the meeting these four held a lengthy
conference. Should Braslan succeed in
st.-ating himself in the directorate they
propose to form a combine and oust the
manager and attorneys President Rea
and his clique employed. Jones' son-in
law, B. G. Tompkins, is slated for the
attorneyship.
Directors Callisch, Jones and Eaton
are threatening to resign should the
Rea faction remain in control of the
bank, as they do not care to shoulder
the responsibility of a failure such an
administration might bring about.
Braslan says he. will bring suit in the
Superior Court to oust Directors R<.a,
Dunlop and Levy, as they are not
stockholders, but merely hold stock in
trust. Attorney Leo Archer is going to
appeal to the Supreme Court to compel
Judge Lorigan to hear the petition of
Filipello and others to have the same
trio of directors removed because of
their indebtedness to the bank.
The depositors are unable to see the
outcome with all these lawsuits and
delays on hand. Many are poor and
in immediate need of their money. A
pitiful case has just come to light. John
Suderland, an old Swede, had toiled
about the farms of this vicinity until
he accumulated $6000. Last December
he intended to go back to Sweden and
spend the remainder of his days. He
deposited his money in the Union Sav
ings Bank for a few days. Five thou
sand dollars of it was in shape of a cer
tificate of deposit. President Ward
Wright at once credited him with $75
interest for the coming quarter on the
back of it, and induced the old man to
delay his trip for a time. Then the
bank failed. Now Suderland is a
mental wreck. The loss of this
money has unbalanced him. He
has been trying to sell his claim
in order to get away. To-day he
sold it to Jacob Miller, a farmer for
$1300 cash. At first Miller offered the
ojd man $500 cash and $>1000 in almost

NEWPORT NEWS, Va., March 28.â
The cruiser Chicago, which left Hamp
ton Roads on March 13 under orders to
overtake the American liner Paris and
transfer from that ship ex-Secretary of
State John Sherman, who had been
taken seriously ill, arrived at Old Point
shortly after noon to-day with the dis
tinguished invalid on board.
Mr. Sherman was one of a party of
tourists who were visiting points of
historical Interest, having chartered the
Paris for the purpose. The Chicago,
after having taken Mr. Sherman on
board, sailed from Santiago last Friday
morning, proceeding direct to this port.
The party that returned with the ex-
Becretary on the Chicago was com-
I of his nephew, Frank Wiborg of
Cincinnati, I>r. McGill of Duluth. the
.physician who had been in constant at

Danitzer, the nurse, who now leaves
the patient. The ex-Secretary's daugh

fchatmberlain Hotel, preparations for
the reception of the invalid at that re
tort having been made under her oer
.fconal supervision. Mr. Wiborc came
oshore when the cruiser dropped an

anxious watchers, and, after a brief
chat with Mrs. McCallum. returned to
the Chicago with nor.
' La^er in the afternoon Mr. Sherman,
closely muffled, and with his features

VESSELS AVAILABLE

Failure of Congress to Settle the Ha-
waiian Registry Question
Proves Beneficial.
HONOLULU, March 21.â The failure of
Congi â  â  ict any legislation for the
- has had one directly beneficial ef
: â .-. It has loosened up a large
amount of tonnage available now
that was tied up in the Hawaiian
try question. The Willscott began
sterday, taking the cargo of
; bier Maui. This morning she
r to the railroad wharf to load
'â 
The Falls of Clyde. Marshal Brown s
fino vessel, will begin loading sugar to go
tlantic ports, though Captain Mat
eon says it has not been decided whether
Ehe will sail for San Francisco or
around the Horn. "
P.oth these vessels have temporary Ha
i registers. When they were re
fused permanent Hawaiian registry by
the loral government the charterers of
th<* Willscott gavp formal notice that
they would not load her while the ques
tion of registry was undetermined.
Congress having adjourned and there be
ing no likelihood of a special session, the
question of registry ceases to be one in
volving any risk to the charterers. The
vessel can "reach its destinationâ the At
lantic coastâ long before it is possible
that trade between these island? and the
mainland can be made coastwise trade
requiring American or permanent Ha
waiian register.
A similar benefit accrues tn the steam
er lines having vessels flying foreign
flaes plying between the islands and the
mainland. It gives them practically an
other vcar in which to get ready to com
ply with the American navigation laws.

HAVE BEEN HAPPILY WEDDED
FOR A FULL HALF-CENTURY
WOODLAND. March 28. â William
Hatcher and his wife, Sarah
Frances Hatcher, have resided in
California for forty-seven years.
For nearly forty-six years their home has
been a fertile and picturesque farm, two
and a half miles north of Cacheville. This
farm of 200 acres they purchased in 1853,
and. in honor of their old home, named it
"Missouri Ranch." The forty-sixth crop
of wheat planted by them is now in a
flourishing condition and the harvest
promises to be abundant.
On Monday a notable event occurred at
their residence. It was the golden anni
versary of their wedding day, and "Uncle
Billy" :ind "Aunt Fannie," as they are
familiarly called, were treated to a
genuine surprise. Both are hale and
hearty and are as active as many people
twenty years their juniors. Both were
about" their usual avocations on Monday
morning, "Aunt Fannie" looking after her
household duties and "L'ncle Billy" driv
ing a team and drag in a near-by field,
when neighbors began to arrive. It soon
dawned upon these good people that their
neighbors and friends were assembling
to do them honor and to celebrate a very
important event in their lives. Both of
them accepted the situation graciously
and in all the happy throng that gathered
In the precincts of that hospitable home
there were none with lighter hearts than j
the host and hostess who for fifty years
â have journeyed along the pathway or lire i
together in " beautiful harmony that has,
never known a cloud, confidence that has ,
never been shaken and love that has
never changed.
One hundred and sixty of the most in
timate friends among the old settlers of
the neighborhood were there. They
brought handsome presents with them j
and well-filled lunch baskets. Tables were
i spread in the shade of stately oak trees.
! and nearly the whole day was spent In
i feasting and speech-making and in the
personnel bill. The report passes favor
ubly on all the officers appointed, so that
all question of their advancement is re
moved. The list is as follows:
Rr-ar Admirals George C. Bemy. Nor
man H. Farquhar, John C. Watson.
Henry R. Robeson, Winfleld S. Schley,
Silas Casey, William T. Sampson. Bart
lett J Cromwell. John W. Philip. Francis
j. Higginson, Henry F. Pickin, Frederick
Rodgers, Louis Kempff and George W.
Sumner.
In addition to these favorable action
was taken on Captain Benjamin F. Pay.
whose formal promotion to the rank of
roar admiral by appointment of the Presi
dent has not yet been made. The retire
ment to-day of Rear Admiral Robeson
caused a vacancy which makes Captain
Day a rear admiral.

NOW MR. OLNEY IS
NAMED FOR PRESIDENT
He Is an Imperialist Without Being
in Favor of the Expansion
Policy.
MILWAUKEE, Wis., March 28.â The
Journal to-day says: That a movement
Is under way to make ex-Secretary of
State Richard Olney the Democratic can
didate for President next year is revealed
in a letter from Boston to the Journal.
General Olney's campaign is based on
the theory that he is in favor of imperial
ism, while opposed to annexation.
The writer of the letter referred to is
very prominent In Democratic politics,
and" lie says the movetneni In Olney's fa
vor is wHI under way. It :b urged in Mr.
Olney's behalf that he. though a gold
Democrat in 189*;, did not make himself
obnoxious to the free-silver element and
that on the expansion question he would
be an available candidate, being opposed
to the annexation of distant islands to
thÂ«Â» territory of the United States. Mr.
Olney's views on the acquisition of for
eiim territory are very pronounced. Hfi
believes in the United States striving with
other nations of the world for commercial
greatness, but not for political extension.

Keynote.
THE TIME IS NOW RIPE

But There Is Enough New Material
to Give the Organization
a Great Send-
Off.
Pppplal IMspateh to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 2Â«.â A special dis
patch to the Tribune from Omaha
credits J. Sterling Morton with the in
tention of forming a new political party
which, he declares, will be the greatest
political organization since the forma
tion of the Republican party. Discuss
ing the proposed new party and the
side lights likely to develop therefrom,
Mr. Morton says:
"I have the utmost faith in the plan.
The party will be organized July 4. and
will stand for conservatism pre-eml-
nently.
"No doubt the platform will contain
some elements common to all parties,
but the keynote will be conservatism.
There is a vast field for this new par
ty's operations.
""The late war and its momentous is
sues, the struggle of the two great
parties over bimetallism; the rise, de
cline and absolute decay of Populism
all these eiements contribute to a situa
tion as pregnant as those which gave
birth to the Republican party on the
approach of our civil strife.
! Mv investigation teaches me that
the time is ripe. I do not care to pose
particularly as the head of the new

WHALE'S HEAD FOUND
ON A MOUNTAIN TOP
Valuable Petrifaction Discovered by
a Scientist in Monterey
County.
MONTEREY, March 28.â News has
reached here from Jamesburg, a small
town In the southern part of this county,
that John Clenford, a scientist of that re
gion, has unearthed a most valuable
scientific specimen in the shape of a por
tion of a petrified whale's head, evidently
that portion where the vertebral column
joins the head. The petrifaction is thirty
inches long, eighteen inches wide and
twelve Inches thick and weighs 830 pounds.
Several small pieces of petrified bone,
which were broken oft" in securing the
specimen, are in the possession of Mr.
The most notable feature of the find is
that it was embedded in sandstone on the
ton of a mountain, about 2500 feet abov<
the sea level, in the vicinity of Charles
Finch's ranch. The region around James
burg Is especially rich in fossil specimens,
many notable linds having been made
within recent years, but this last one is
decidedly the most valuable.

TOURIST LOST IN
LUIS REY VALLEY
flged Man, Seemingly lQsat)eÂ»
Leaves a Trair) and Wanders
Into the Brusfy
â  SAN DIEGO, March 28.â A 'plainly dressed man, about 65 years old, â 
<> who was enroute' to this city from the East, left the south-bound passen- 8
*% ger train at Oceanside, forty miles north of this city, yesterday after- p
iS noon and after wandering about Oceanside a few hours, walked out to Â£5
Â£ San Luis R&y Valley. He was last seen walking in the brush near the Â»
i? main county road in the valley. Â£$
SÂ» When the fact that the old man had left the train was called to 53
6 the attention of Conductor Clegg, soon after the train left Oceanside, he #
V requested the station agent and others at Oceanside to find the man and Â«g
9 give him proper directions for reaching this cityâ his destination. The gÂ»
Â« fact that the man- had offered the conductor money to pay his fare here -8
â¢5 after having already given up his ticket, together with other actions of g
5 the stranger, convinced Conductor Clegs: that the old man was in a dazed g.
0 condition. Before going out into San Luis Rey Valley yesterday after- <>
â¢* noon the old man asked persons in Oceanside when the next steamer iS
6 left for this city, and upon being informed that no steamers connected Â£g
O the two places appeared to be greatly disappointed. O
Â£0 Two officers of Oceanside started last evening on horseback to find 28
5 the man, but were unsuccessful. They returned to Oceanside this morn- g
% ing and reported he could not be found. The man's name and the placo $
6 he came from in the East are not known to the railroad officials. Search S$
<2 is being made for him. No inquiries have been made at the Santa- Fe Â«
& office here to-day for the old man. <*

Brown declined to give the name of
the man to the committee. The com
mittee insisted, and finally Brown said
that the person who made him the of
fer was ex-Congressman Monroe H.
Kuip of Shamokin.

MURDER CHARGE
MAY BE BROUGHT
Pittsburg Clubman in
Trouble.
HIS RIVAL IN LOVE SLAIN
GBAND JURY PROBABLY WILL
INDICT HIM.
Report That B. C. Bakewell Is to Be
Accused of the Killing of Thomas
Pinckney of Charles- '
ton.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ATLANTA, Ga., March 28.â A special
from Charleston, S. C, says that the
Grand Jury which is trying to solve the
mystery surrounding the death of
Thomas Pinckney, who was killed sev
eral weeks ago, supposedly by foot
pads, will bring in a presentment this
week calculated to cause the biggest
sensation known in that city for years.
The latest sensation haÂ£ been caused
by the efforts of the Grand Jury to
learn further facts about Benjamin C.
Bakewell of Pittsburg, who, it is al
leged, is engaged to Miss Elizabeth
Barden, the young lady on whom
Pinckney was calling the night he was
shot.
PITTSBURG, Pa., March 28.â 8. C.
Bakewell is a prominent society and
club man of Pittsburg.
Pinckney was murdered on Saturday
night, February 25, Just after having
called on Miss Elizabeth Barden, a so
cial favorite, to whom he had paid at
tention for a year or more as a suitor.
B. C. Bakewell of Pittsburg had also
been paying the young woman atten
tion for a year or more and their en
gagement had been announced, though
no date had been fixed for the marriage.
Pinckney and Bakewell were the best
of friends before and after Bake well's
engagement to Miss Barden.
Charles Wharton, a brother-in-law of
B. C. Bakeweil, and who speaks for
him, was seen to-night. He said:
"B. C. Bakewell, my brother-in-law,
is well known in Pittsburgh business
and social life. The Friday night be
fore young Pinckney was murdered in
Charleston my brother-in-law left
Pittsburg for Charleston. He arrived
in Charleston, S. C, the following Sun
day morning at 7:45 o'clock, the morn
ing after Pinckney had been murdered.
When the Coroner's inquest was held
Mr. Bakewell was examined on the
strength of the many wild rumors that
had been set alloat connecting his
name with the crime. He courted an
investigation and showed conclusively
by the trainmen with whom he had
traveled all the night of the murder
that it was impossible for him to have
been within several hundred miles of
the scene of the crime at the time it
occurred. His alibi was established be
yond question and the matter was then
dropped.
"1 cannot believe that the Grand Jury
is seriously considering the question of
finding an indictment against Mr.
Bakewell. If such action should be
taken, however, Mr. Bakewell will go
to Charleston at once and will have no
trouble in establishing an alibi as to
his -whereabouts the night of the mur
der that will leave no doubt in the
mind of any sane man of his inno
cence."
The Bakewell family is one of the
oldest and most prominent in this sec
tion of the State, having been prom
inently identified with the industrial,
educational and social development of
Pittsburg during the past century.
DRUGGED AND ROBBED
OF HIS VALUABLES
M. LUTHER GIVEN "KNOCKOUT"
DROPS IN A SALOON.
He Pays Dearly for Drinking With
Sociable Strangers in a Dupont
Street Resort.
Mi not Luther, who resides at 634%
Broadway, visited police headquartera
last night and reported that he had been
druggtMi and robbed by two unknown
men on Dupont street Sunday evening.
He stated he was on his way home and
stopped at a saloon for some refresh
ments, and while imbibing at the bar the
men he accuses of having drugged him
struck up a conversation. Another round
of drinks was taken and Luther left tho
place.
He had not gone many steps when the
"knockout" drops began to take effect
on him. The robbers followed closely, be
hind him, and seeing their prey was help.
le. , lerked him into a dark doorway and
relieved him of his watch and chain and
a large sum of money.
Although in a bad condition, Luther
managed to stagger to his home and
when he arrived there tho effects of the
drug had worn off and he discovered he
had lost his valuables. At first he was
ashamed to disclose that he had been
robbed, but the desire to regain p
sion of tho watch, which he values high
ly, it having been presented to him. de
cid.ed him to notify the police. Shortly
after he had reported his loss last even
ing he> w;is asked to toll how the robbery
occurred. He was averse to having his
name made public in connection with the
affair, and declared that he could not
remember the place in which he met the
robbers or describe their appearance, as
the drug seemed to have effaced them
from his memory. Detectives Sullivan
and Harper have benn detailed on the
case and expect to land the "knockout"
men.
FORMAL TRANSFER BEGINS.
Valley Road Deeds a Valuable Piece
of Property to the Santa Fe
Company.
The first formal transfer of property
from the San Francisco and San Joaquin
Valley Railway Company to the Santa
Fe road was made yesterday. The trans
fer was of the piece of property at the
corner of Sptar and Harrison streets,
which was originally purchased by the
Valley road for warehouse purposes. It
is valued at $381,000. The deed of trans
frr was filed with the County Recorder
late yesterday afternoon. It is signed by
Claus Spreckels as president and Alex
ander Mackie as secretary of the San
Francisc-o and San Joaquin Valley Rail
way Company. The Santa Fe Terminal |
Company is named as the grantee. The

Davis Died of Consumption.
H. Ww Davis, the man who died sud
denly last Monday night in a lodging
house at No. 44 Third street, was iden
tified yesterday as formerly a Deputy
Fish Commissioner and had been work
ing for H. Emerie at San Pablo. An ex
amination of the remains showed that
consumption was the cause of death.
The dead man has relatives in Grass
Valley and was married.
He came to this city from San Pablo
for medical attendance a day or two be
fore he died. He was only 34 years old.
A Coincidence in Names.
In yesterday's Call mention was made
of the death of H. W. Davis, a deputy
constable of San Pedro, who expired
nfter a short illness in the Winchester
House on Third street. A large number
of people supposed that the dead man waa
a brother of Deputy Fish Commis
John H. Davis, but such is not the case.
The peculiarity of the situation is that
the deceased and John Davis' f.rother
have the same initials and both have been
deputy constables at San Pedro. The dead
man held his position as an officer by
virtue of being a game keeper for one of
the hunting clubs in Contra Costa County,
while the other Davis was a regularly ap
pointed officer.

WASHINGTON, March 28.â Captain
George B. Davis, commissary of sub
sistence, was the first witness to appear
before the beef Inquiry court to-day.
He was on duty in the office of the
commissary general and assisted in
preparing the Santiago beef contract
with Swift & Co., dealing especially
with the preparation of the clause coy
. erihg the time the beef was to be kept
: in refrigerators on shore. He had
talked with General Eagan on this
". subject when the contract was In course
..of preparation, and had understood
.from him that the beef was to be kept
in refrigerators seventy-two hours
after its arrival.
" \Captain Davis detailed some in
.etances in which the hoards of survey
; had examined beef which had been
complained of while in the refrigerator.
One instance occurred at Manzanillo
]' and another at Santiago. In the first
. the beef was condemned, and in the lat
ter a part of it was.
In reply to Major Lee Captain Davis
v paid the understanding in the commis
sary general's office was that th beef
was to be kept good for seventy-two
hour? by the contractors after leaving
the ship, providing good" care was
taken of it.
'â¢â This was the extreme limit." he said,
"but it was not supposed that the beef
â¢would he kept for more than twenty
four hours."
Captain Davis said he had heard
something of the Powell process for
preserving beef: that a proposition was
made before the beginning of the war
and after General Weston had brought
the proceedings to the attention of the
department as the result of experi
â  ments made with it at Tampa about the
time of the sailing of the Santiago ex
pedition.â¢
Major Lee pointed out the apparent
discrepancy in Captain Davis' and Gen
eral Eagan's testimony as to the condi
tions under which beef was to be kept
for seventy-two hours after arrival at
its destination. He read General Ea
par- statement saying it was his
intention that the beef should be good
for seventy-two hours, "no difference
where taken from," and saying that the
twenty-four-hour clause , must be a
CUBANS COME FOR
AMERICAN GOLD
Assembly Agents Reach
Washington.
; â¢ The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 28.â Senors
Jose R. Villalon and A. Heva, who were
appointed by the Cuban assembly to
present to the Washington authorities
the resolutions of that body, have ar
rived in this city. Their mission, in
tion to the presentation of the reso
lutions, is to explain in detail the situa
tion with reference to the insurgent
army. While the assembly did not re
ject the $3,000,000 which General Gomez
arranged with Robert P. Porter to re
ceive and pay off the Cuban troops,
they believed it to be entirely inade
quate to meet the situation. They de
sire at least $10,000, 000, and as much
more as can be obtained. They argue
that if the Cuban army is disbanded
after the distribution of but $3,000,000,
which would give to each enlisted man
about $68, the money so obtained would
be barely sufficient for them to procure
s ami return to their homes, leav
ing them no margin upon which to en
ter upon the peaceful pursuits of life.
Without the means of subsistence,
- Villalon says, disorders would
almost Inevitably follow and perhaps
brigandage. The object both of the
United States and of the assembly, says
Senor Villalon, is to secure tranquility
In Cuba preparatory' to the setting up
by the Cuban people of an independent
government and he says it is, therefore.
as much to the interests of the United
States authorities as to those who im
mediately represent th*> Cuban patri
ots that the disbanded soldiers be
given an opportunity to return to civil
pursuits.
The assembly represents, r.ot the Cu
ban people, Senor Villalon declares, but
only those who have been in arms
E trup- 'heir Independence.
Senor Villalon and his colleague will
probably sef-k an audience witn the
President himself. If this be denied
they will F p e the Secretary of War.
If the President receives these gen
tlemen it will be as visiting citizens.
â  In their representative capacity.
No =uch recognition will be accorded
â¦hem If they desire to pr-sent a pc
- or request to this Government it
will have to go through the ordinary
channels. and in this instance it will
be through the military arm of the
â nment Such a petition, when
presented will be referred to General
ke as Military Governor of Cuba
a^d the one person authorized to deal
with Cuban affairs. It is also probable
Oiese Cubans will be told that any an
swer to the request or petition will
come from General Brooke.

toF Frank L- Coombs was banqueted by
TamalpÂ«.i3 Parlor No. 64, Native Sons of
the Golden West, last evening in honor
of his late appointment as United States
District Attorney. A large number of
numbers of the order and their friends
were present and passed an enjoyable
evening Mr. Coombs spoke for nearly
an hour in regard to the welfare of the
order and was followed in brief addresse
by Judge F. M. Angellottl and District
the banquet the parlor held a
meeting and elected delegates to the an

clerical error. He asked Captain Da
vis to reconcile the two statements, to
which request the captain responded
by saying:
"General Eagan had simply forgot
ten. Probably he had not seen the con
tract for six months. It is not custom
ary in such cases to depend upon the
memory, the contracts being on file,
and reference to them convenient and
usual."
' The witness said there had been con
siderable discussion in the office of the
commissary general of the feasibilty of
shipping beef on the hoof, but it had
been decided not to try the experiment,
because of the difficulty of getting
ships, of landing the cattle and of tak
ing care of them after landed. The
Subsistence Department had, however,
gone so far as to gather the names
of persons who might desire to hid.
Bernard F. Murtagh. also an agent
for Armour & Co. at Lakeland during
the presence of the troops, gave the
details of the supply there. He said
the beef was generally held in the cars
for three days, th- cars being well iced.
About one-third of the contents of one
car had been rejected and after this
the meat was shipped in refrigerator
boxes. Some of this boxed meat also
was rejected. Both Messrs. Murtach
and Smith testified that they had never
known anything of the use of preserva
tives, and both said that Sergeant
Mason, who testified that preservatives
had been used, had praised the quality
of the beef.
Charles 11. Morehouse, manager of
the Tampa branch of Armour & Co.'s
establishment, said that from Hay 20
to June 1, 29.000 pounds of ice was used
at Lakeland. He said the beef sup
plied to th^ troops was of the same
quality as that supplied to the Florida
hotels. No preservatives had been
used on the beef. He was willine to
take oath as to that. The principal
trouble was that some of the commis
sary officers knew nothing of b>- I
George W. Watson, railroad agent at
Lakeland, said he had often erono into
the cars in which the !;Â»-â¢â¢Â£ was carried
and that the meat did not present any
unusual appearance. He had eaten
some of the rejected meat and had
found it to be as good beef as he had
ever tasted.
ThÂ» afternoon session was executive
in character and was devoted princi
pally to the consideration of witnesses
tn be called in the future. It Is ex
-1 that Major Bla^k. who was a
member of General Miles' staff in Porto
Rico, and Captain Pomerny, who ac
companied the expedition as a .com
missary officer, will be heard to-mor
row, and that later in the week some
of th^ medical officers of the army will
appear on the stand.
GUARDING AGAINST
STRIFE IN SAMOA
America's Conciliatory
Note to Germany.
Special IMFi>atrh to The Call.
BERLIN', March 28.â Th<= correspond
ent here of the Associated Press has
obtained on the highest authority at
this capital the following explanation
of a feature of the Samoan question,
which has lately arisen: On the report
that the American Government had
cabled to its admiral at Samoa to act
in accordance with the decision of two
of the representatives of the Powers,
the German Government made earnest
representation to the American Em
bassador here. Andrew White, that the
Berlin treaty required the concurrence
of the three powers and called atten
tion to the dangers which were sure to
arise if there was anything like a vio
lation of the treaty.
The American Government made a
frank and conciliatory answer, which
â I much satisfaction here. It rec
ognized the necessity for unanimity
upon the part of all threÂ« powers under
the treaty as a condition of any settled
policy or permanent action and de
clared the admiral was authorized to
act in agreement with a majority of the
representatives of the powers only in
a case of emergency which absolutely
did not admit of delay; but in such
case ratification of adjustment
by unanimous vote of three powers
must be sought at the first possible
moment and no permanent arrange
ment may be made without such una
nimity.
The American Government, it is
is added, cabled to its representatives
in Samoa to maintain the most friendly
and conciliatory action toward the
German representatives and German
interests, carefully avoiding anything
likely to be misconstrued or to create
ill will.
In consequence of the stories regard
ing Mataafa having sanctioned secta
rian tyranny. th<* German Government
assured Mr. White that all its influence
would be exerted against interference
with the religion of any sect.
WASHINGTON*. March 28. â Th*
I facts stated in the preceding dispatch
i,are confirmed here. Its effect will be
! to allay any fears that may have been
j felt that a diplomatic rupture with
! Germany over the Samoan question
1 was possible. It is probable that an
i effort will now b>~ made by the three
governments to bring about a settle
\ ment of the matters in dispute. Mean
i while if any emergency should arise
' calling for immediate decision. Admiral
Kautz will support the majority of the
Governments represented. His orders
are intended to cover cases where one
of the representatives of the different
Governments refuses to consent to what
I a majority favors where immediate
i action is imperative.

has been removed; and whereas, the
: board for the purpose of filling the
revolving fund and continuing the
operation of the jute mill did believe
that an emergency existed which
justified the sale of bags in quanti
ties exceeding 5000; and whereas,
such emergency no longer exists;
therefore be it
RESOLVED, That henceforth no
order not already accepted for any
quantity exceeding 5000 bags to any
: one consumer shall be filled or ac
cepted; and further
RESOLVED. That the Warden, for
the purpose of making a wide dis
tribution among consumers of the
State of the prison-made bags, en
deavor to sell the quantity on hand
in lots of 5000 or less, and that the
authority conferred upon him to sell
in larger lots be revoked, and that all
orders for quantities exceeding 5000
lots not previously accepted be re
jected.
"When the State Board of Prison- Di
rectors met in special session in this city
last Saturday its one purpose was to in
vestigate what a member of the board
evidently thought a cleverly planned
scheme on the part of a "ring" of specu
lators to pain control of the grain bags
manufactured at the San Quentin jute
mill and "cinch" every farmer in the
State for a goodly percentage of the
profits of his labor. The apparently inno
cent resolution given in the foregoing,
adopted by the board at that meeting as
a result of their conference, means in
reality that the farmers are to he pro
tected from the threatened operations of a
gigantic "ring." It is estimated that the
quantity of grain harvested this year, in
view of the favorable weather conditions,
will be as vast as that of 1883, and the
amount that might have been wrung out
of the farmers by a corner on sacks would
have been enormous.
Not only did the board make it Impos
sible to prevent a wide distribution of
Backs by this order, but in view of their
belief that the manipulators of The sus
pected â¢Ting" had already made too good
progress in the plan to corner the output
c jutemill, it was found necessary
to cancel two late contracts calling for a
25,000 sacks.
In 1*93 th* legislature enacted a law
that no order shall be filled for any one
individual or firm during one year for
more than WOO grain bags, except on re
quest of the Warden and the unanimous
approval of the State Board of Prison
â¢ors. .The law further provides that
all orders for Jute goods must be accom
i by an affidavit setting f<">rth that
.-nount of goods contained in the or
der are for the individual and personal
use of the applicant.
A few months ago it was found neces
sary by the board, on account of the re
volving fund of $100,000 with which the ex
penses of running the jute mill are met
â¢:;:ng depleted, to authorize the War
den to dispose of 1,000,000 sacks in unlim
ited quantities. At two different times
after this, for the same reason, that offi-
c ial was empowered to sell 500. CM) sacks in
the same, manner. In this way 2,040,000
sacks were sold prior to the meeting c
last Saturday, which, with sales in lots
of 5000 amounted to 2,385,000 sacks sold
since January 1 of the present year up to
the time of adopting the order, which
renders a wide distribution of sacks a safe
proposition. .
A week or two ago a prominent firm nt
speculators of this city sens in an
gacks, which was shortly aft^r
followed by an order from another firm
for 25000 It seems that these unusually
orders excited the suspicion of Di
- James H. Wilkins of San Rafael
for more reasons than one. In the !irÂ«"
the provisions of the board for the
relief of the revolving fund by which the
jute mill is run had resulted in a rush of
orders from all over the State, several for
lots of 100.000 and one for 6fi0,000. After
â¢ig out the amount of sacks on
hand and the number that could be manu
factured by August 1, the time the farm
ers will harvest their crops and must
have the sacks without delay, he evi
dently reached the conclusion that if the
holders of the larger orders should find it
icif-nt to enter into a- pool the farm
ers would be in a bad way.
Accordingly President Fitzgerald was
asked to call a special meeting of the
board which occurred in this city last
Saturday. When the board assembled
the directors w.-re very much surprised
to find a number of enterprising repre
sentatives of the press on handâsome
thing they had never counted on for a
moment. After a private discussion the
board sat down and had a few minutes
rsation on various things supposed
to relate to prison welfare and then ad
journed, only to come together later on,
when no inquisitive auditors were in the
neighborhood, and discuss the proposition
for which they had assembled
Warden Hale informed the board tha\
on January 1 there were on hand ;3. 330. UOO
sacks that since January 1..83.000 sacks
been manufactured, and that by
August 1 about 1.4W .000 sacks can be
made. This would make a total of 5,524.
--000 sacks. Deducting the 2.380,000 sacks
already sold and disposed of 3,133.000 sacks
would remain for those farmers of the
State who are not now supplied.
It was concluded that the condition of
things justified the adoption of a reso
lution that hereafter sacks shall be sold
in lots not to exceed 5000. but the board
was not satisfied with that alone and
went so far as to cancei contracts en
tered into in the last few days for Uo.
--000 sacks. Since that meeting the board
is doubtless more firmly convinced than
. . -hat some action of the kind was
necessary, for orders have come in fnr
sacks in lots of over 5000 amounting to
217 000 Two were for 150.000 and another
for 80,000. All these orders have been
held and the persons who sent them noti
|â¢ .! that they cannot purchase more
than 5000 sacks apiece this year.
"I do not know that there wa.s any m
tr-ntion of forming a ring." said Director
Wilkina when seen yesterday, "nor do I
desire tn make any accusation of the
kind. But in view of the fact that the
orders were for such large Itfts and that
if the purchasers should see fit to come
tog-ether and make a corner on sacks the
farmers would be 'cinched.' I considered
it at least my duty to have President
Fitzgerald call the board together and
present the facts fnr their consideration.
The quantity of grain harvested this year
will probably be as vast as that of the
year i*S3. and when farmers need the
sacks they i.eed them without any loss
of time. It takes ninety days to bring the
article here from Calcutta and none of
them can wait. As the jute mill at San
Quentin is the only thing standing be
tween the farmers and the speculators,
for the protection of the former it was |
thought necessary to provide for an
emergency by such action as the board
saw lit to take."

SAGACIOUS "BOW-WOW"
AND A WILY CHINESE
AWIT/T Chinese namM Ah Kop, similar to the one mentioned in "Rr.-t
Harte's poetical effort, is= In evidence at the City Prison. He is high
ly skilled in the presto change craft of the "Melican man." but the
strong hand of the law has reached his collar and the day.- spent in
the study of how to aid and abet the lottery company have been all for
naught.
Yesterday ho was captured by Officer Taylor of Lieutenant Price's squad
near Chinatown and was obliged to submit to the embarrassment of having
his habiliments searched in sight of about 2iv> of the curious sort, it being
suspected th;tt lottery tickets wore somewhere hidden in the aforesaid gar
ments. During the operation the Chinese smiled and this pmile broadened
to a grin when the officer failed to find any of the little strips 'or green
parchment.
Disheartened. Taylor was about to depart, when he espied a large, dis
reputable looking canine that came near the Celestial apparen^y to offer
sympathy. From under the doggie's collor the long-sought for tickets pro
truded. Ah Kee was then declared a prisoner and the officer made a grab for
the dog. No amount of coaxing could, however, induce the sagacious ani
mal to cross the danger line.
An hour was spent in futil*> effort to gather the requisite evidence, when
an event occurred which crowned the peace guardian's effort wit., success.
\ relative nf the wise bow-wow approached at this moment and in the fona
greeting which followed Ah Kees brute forgot its position and was quickly
made a prisoner.
Ah Kee was bustled into, the patrol wagon and taken to jail, but no
charge thus far has been entered against the dog.

NELLIE RODGERS TRIUMPHS.
Judg-e Mog-an Decides That She Did
Not Embezzle Attorney Nagle's
Ring.
Judge Mog-an yesterday rendered his de
cision in the case of Mrs. Nellie Rodgers.
charged by Attorney Charles G. Nag.c
with embezzling a ring which the fair
defendant got from him November 22
last, as she claimed, as an engagement
ring. The Judge briefly reviewed the
evidence, pointing out its salient features
both for the prosecution and defense, and
said: . .
"If there -was an engagement and the
defendant got the ring as an engage
ment ring it became her sole property,
and if the engagement was broken a
criminal prosecution cannot li<? for the
return, of the ring. From all the evi
dence I am satisfied that if there was
no engagement the facts show that it
certainly bordered upon me. I am satis
isfi-=d that no jury would convict the
defendant of embezzling the ring and the
order and judgment of the court is that
the defendant be discharged.
E. T. DOYLE IS WANTED.
Edward T. Doyle, assistant secretary of
the Olympic- Club, is wanted on a charge
of felony embezzlement. He is missing,
and the police are confident that he is fly
ing eastward as fast as the cars will car
ry him.
The offense with which Doylp is charged
is the .mhpzzlement of $2>Â»> from the
Olympic Club. It was discovered Monday
afternoon, an hour after he had left the
building for the purpose, ostensibly, of
getting some small change. Superintend
ent Kennedy of the Olympic Club heard
that he had left a note for friends, bid
ding them good-by. He had left it at thÂ»
Western I'nion offW, at Sutter and I^eav
enworth streets, with instructions to de
liver it after 7 o'clook. Kennedy made an
investigation of Doyle's cash and found
that it was Bhort $2S*. and yesterday, at
the request of Treasurer H. B. Rufs,
swore out a warrant for the arrest of the
missing cashier.

OPPOSITION TO
TROOPS' RECALL
CAUSES STRIFE
Relatives of the First
California Meet.
For a time excitement became rampant
at a meeting of the relatives and repre
sentatives of the First California Regi
ment, stationed at Manila, held last even
ing In the National Guard Armory. Polk
and ElliP streets. The occasion was a de
velopment of opposition to efforts for the
release of the hoys, which was em
phatically resented by hosts of anxious
parents, sweethearts and sisters, who
seem determined to make every effort to
assist the return of the soldiers to their
firesides. C. AY. Moore of the Hancock
School acted as chairman, and A. L.
Badt held the position of secretary.
Harrowing tales of dire distress and tor
ture were related by relatives from com
munications received from the seat of
war. One in particular, toM by J. A
Ohlson, brought tears to many eyes. I.
W. Roussel was enthusiastic in his ap
peal for the meeting to attempt some
thing to solve the problem of speedy re
turn, and he, like other speakers, was
loudly applauded.
At this juncture a resolution was offered
by Joseph Young which read as follows:
Whereas. The Volunteers now in the Philip
pine Islands enlisted to fight in a war with
Spain and not to fight against the Filipinos;
Whereas, War with Spain li now over, since
both the United States and Spain have ratified
the treaty of peace;
Therefore, we, the relatives and representa
tives of the First California Volunteers, most
earnestly request, in the name of humanity
and of patriotism, that said regiment shall be
ordered home and mustered out of service.
Then came the expression of opposition :
sentiment which caused the trouble, 'me '
audience, having listened to tales of
blood and suffering and entertaining love
for its kin. was in no mood to receive it. I
Several persons ventured to state that I
from information received by them the j
soldiers at the present time desired to
remain and right to the end. They ad
mitted that while there was a lull in the
warfare the soldiers had expressed a
wish to return, but when the odor of
powder again greeted their nostrils the
old spirit of patriotism returned and
made them contented on the battlefield.
These persons were promptly hissed, and
it became evident that the sentiment of
the meeting was not with them. â¢
George T. Phelps. a member of the Na
tional Guard in whose hall the meeting
was held, importuned the relatives to
consider the fact that there were volun
teers other than those from California
at Manila, and that other States had not
taken up the cry for their return. He
begged that the resolution do not pass
for the reason that it would brand the
members of the First California as
isâ deserters in the face of duty.
A storm of disapproval burst forth.
"Have you a relative in tho regiment?"
was shouted from the platform. "If you
have not we do not wish, to hear from
you. This meeting is held tor relatives
only."
"The announcement on the board out
side says "friends and relatives,' " re
torted Phelps. "and. having: at least 200
friends among the soldiers, I have a
right to express my sentiments."
He persisted in speaking, but the chair
man drowned his voice with the pound
ing of his gavel and ordered him to stop.
"I denounce the resolution as un-Amer-
Ican," he continued, and this statement
was resented by the person who intro
duced it. who said it was the first time
his patriotism had been questioned.
When Phelps found that his efforts at
discussion were futile he left the hall.
The meeting adjourned until next Tues
day evening after President Moore had
ruled that the resolution having caused
pc much disturbance should not be put
to a vote.
THE ATONEMENT BY
CHRIST'S BLOOD
MOODY TALKS FEELINGLY TO A
LARGE AUDIENCE.
If the thief who stole Evangelist
Moody' 8 coat had been present yesterday
afternoon at the meeting held in Y. M. C.
A. Auditorium he would have been con
strained to deliver up the ill-gotten rai
ment.
"That is why I am here to-day," "said
the grief-stricken old gentleman. "I am
waiting for the outcome. A while ago
my son lost a beautiful boy by death. It
was I who prevailed on the parents to
come to California, thinking it might di
vert them. Now their faith in Him may
be put to the test again. The little girl
may follow the brother who has gone be
fore."
Mr. Moody received a telegram toward
the end of the meetine. and after reading
it stated that he would remain in the city
to-day &nd would talk in the Y. M. C. A.
auditorium at 10 a. m. and 2 p. m. on sub
jects yet to be announced.
Mr. Moody has never before spoken to
better advantage than h*- dM on the sub
ject "The Atonement." His plain, uncon
ventional delivery was made doubly
earnest by the sorrow gnawing at his
heartstrings, and he moved his hearers as
they have never been moved before.

BALLOT REFORM LAWS.
L] the Stratum primary law is a sham and
' a pretense there is no occasion for the hysteri
cal pyrotechnics with which the Examiner has
greeted- the appearance of the Rickard ballot bill upon
the statute-book;. If Governor Gage -was justified in
signing the former he was justified in signing the lat
ttr, for the complete operation of one is involved to
seme extent with the operation of the other. Why a
newspaper which hailed one as the incarnation of bal
lot reform should denounce the other as the ""pet
measure of the scoundrel bosses'' is certainly incom
prehensible to a healthy mind.
Thr Stratton primary law provides for a legal elec
tion for delegates to nominating conventions, but in
order to hold a convention and obtain a place upon
the ballot under a party- name a political organization
must choose delegates in every precinct. Rump con
ventions, or conventions which emanate from self
constituted â¢"committees'' or ""piece clubs," will not be
recognized. -The law authorizes independent move
ments, but discredits party designations for them. I:
the Non-Partisans of this city, for instance, can prove
that they obtained 3 per cent ot the vote cast at the
last election tney can put a tiCKet on the bahot under
the name "-Independent." but that is all.

RUSSiANIZfITION OF FINLAND.
THE proposed Rnssianization of Finland is one
of these exercises of despotic power that will
excite the indignation of the civilized world and ;
! go far to disprove the sincerity of the Czar in his sug- j
gestion of disarmament, which is to be the subject of j
an international conference at the Hague. On Mon- j
day last this subject was referred to in an extract from j
called The Skandinaven, and in a brief j
communication published in The Call.
There has been no greater outrage recorded in his
tory than the partition of Poland in 1772 between j
Russia. Austria and Prussia. This dismemberment of j
an ancient kingdom, which it was compelled formally 1
to sanction in 1778, was followed in 1793 by an addi- !
tiona] territorial grab by Russia ad by Prussia. In :
1814. by the treaty of Vienna, the entire robbery was j
finally ratified. Meanwhile the rebellion under j
Kosciusko had been suppressed and that hero and 1
patriot captured by the Russians and subjected to such |
barbarous and humiliating treatment that the public j
opinion of civilized mankind was aroused and ex- j
pressed in such form as the immortal lines of Thomas
Campbell in his '"Pleasures of Hope":
Hope for a season bade the world farewell.
And Freedom shrieked when Kosciusko fell.
In principle the partition of Poiand was not a whit ;
more shameful than the present Russianization of i
Finland, at the very moment when the Czar is preach- i
ing the gospel of universal peace. There are about \
two millions of the Finns, occupying territory that
covers 144,221 square miles. They are an ancient, an
industrious and an intelligent people, with a large 1
and increasing commerce, with agricultural resources,
with diversified manufactures, and with a rich and
attractive literature. Between 1772 and 1789, almost
simultaneously with the establishment of the Americ
an republic, their present constitution was formed
end perfected, and it included two principles dear to
the American people, namely, the right of self-taxa
tion and complete religious toleration. The Czar of
Russia is the Archduke of Finland, and invested with
the power of proclaiming war and peace, of pardoning
criminals and of appointing officials, exclusively from
the natives of the country, and including an Imperial
Senate of eighteen members who constitute the local
government and by whom justice is administered.
In ISO 9, when Swedish Finland was annexed to Rus
sia, the Czar. Alexander I, solemnly pledged himself
to maintain "the religion, laws, rights and privileges
of each rank" within the Grand Dukedom of Finland
"unchanged in their full strength." This pledge was
renewed by each of his successors, and by the present
Czar November t â

CONAL VERSUS RAILROAD.
WHETHER Chicago in the near future is to be
. a way station ber.vetn New York and
San Francisco or the greatest metropolis in the
world with the two ocean cities serving as simple
ports of entry subordinate to her commerce is a
problem whose solution is seemingly to be deter
mined by forces now in operation and beyond the
control of either of the three cities whose fortunes
ibject to them.
The first of these forces is the combination of rail
ways into great transcontinental systems. Only a
short time ago Chicago was the great railway ter
minal of the Union. The big lines from the East
and the West met there. The Atlantic seaboard roads
stopped at her depots, and the Pacific Coast roads
stnrted from them. The city was the dividing point
of transportation, and vast and far-reaching were the
commercial benefits she derived from the position.
The recent combinations of railroads have now es
tablished a series of transcontinental lines from ocean
to ocean. Passengers and freight are to be carried
from New York to San Francisco without change
of cars, or without passing from the control of one
railroad management to another. Chicago has been
sidetracked, as it were. She is to-day virtually a way
station, and unless something intervenes will in a few
year; lose her present prestige in the commercial
world.
It appears, however, that something is going to in
tervene, and something of such commercial potency
that it will more than counterbalance the shifting of
railway transportation. When the Canadians have
completed the Georgian Bay canal Chicago will have
a waterway to the ocean so direct and of such dimen
sions that European trade will come to her â¢
and New York will be sidetracked.
The distance from Chicago to Montreal by this
route will be 980 miles, of which 950 miles will be
open lake, sheltered lake and improved river, and
thirty miles of canal fourteen feet deep. The distance
from Chicago to New York by the Erie canal and
Hudson River is 1415 miles, of which 1065 miles is
lake and river and 350 miles of canal seven feet deep,
through which boats carrying 8000 bushels of grain
are moved by horsepower. When the Georgian Bay
canal is completed wheat will be carried from ports on
the three upper lakes in steel steam vessels in four days
to the ship's ?ide in Montreal for 2 cents per bushel,
and return cargoes of imported merchandise will be
carried, in bond, from Montreal to our ports upon
the lakes for 75 cents per ton, or less. The distance

ecrs. and after that Chicago expects the Erie
canal, more famed in politics and scandals than in
song : 1 be useful mainly as an irrigai
â  - â  -:-.ing of that kind. The great mass ol
European imports will come to Chicago and be dis
">.Yest and South from that point. The
ids will have to conform to the ocean traffic, and
the city by the lake wi'l resume her proud pc
:â  :rce of the country. Sht :cned
to-day with the fate of a way station, but her hopes
a-e great in the work of the Canucks.
\ THEN the r.ext Congress assembles the Somh
\ em States will find themselves represented
* there in political hostility to all the rest of the
Union, notwithstanding the vigor of the renewed fra
ternal relations which have been warmed into such a
cordial glow by the events of the war.
In the Senate the Southern delegation will 1

Â». In the House there will be but fifty-five Rep
resentatives from the North and the West to go into
:h the 10S Democrats of the South and give
â  the semblance of representing a national party.
h being the situation, the South finds h:
sidetracked and isolated. Her delegation in each
branch of Congress will be in opposition to an over
wheli _ representing the other States.
ra of good feeling the political divisions
in Congress will be more sectional than ever before
in our history, not even excepting the stormy years
receded the outbreak of the Civil War.
The intelligence of the South recognizes the false
â  :â . - in which she is placed and bitterly denounces
the : the mad devotees of free silver who led
her into it. Thus the Richmond Tiir.es declared a few
cays ;.
"Let us face I let us no longer deceive our
selves. The Democratic party to-day is without char
acter and standing in the nation. It has lost the con-
E not 1 respect, of the great body of
â¢ l loughtful men of this country. What
the party stand for? What are its principles? What
man is there in this party to-day who can stand up
with any sort of confidence and declare th<
The situation is the more galling to the South be
cause her people have prided themselves on their de
â¢ a to polil - a-nd their capacity for
the business of politics. Now they find themselves
the sole supporters of a party that has neither prin
ciples nor political sagacity. Their representation in
Congress will be utterly futile so far as national issues
are concerned â not even as important to the Govern
ment as the tail to a kite.
While the bad plight of the South is apparent even
it will be much more so when Congress assem
bles and the divisions of parties in both Houses are
made conspicuous by the proceedings of the session.
Then indeed the South will have an object k
from which to learn the full extent of the folly of '96
and the expediency of turning away from Bry<?
and getting into touch again with the rest of the
country politically as she has shown herself to be in
â¢ â¢ tism.
SOMETIMES San Francisco has qualms of con
science and mourns over her wickedness. The
spectacle of Boards of Education stealing- the
or of Supervisors entering upon their terms i
- but honest and emerging rich but rotten, has a
tendency to depress. Often the conduct of political
campaigns has been marked by crookedness and ras- \
cals have ridden into power on the shoulders of a lot I
ses w.ho ought to be picking over jute at San
Quentin. and yet in every administration there has i
been an element of good, a degree of attention has
been paid to the public weal, and the executive head
has usually been clean, even if the law forced him
to be helpless.
But San Francisco may compare herself with Chi
cago and swell with pride. Here at least thugs and
toughs known as such are not elected to office.
There must be the seeming of respectability. The
â¢dives are not scoured for material and their beetle
browed proprietors hoisted into office. In Chicago
no man, so he happen for the nonce not to be in the
penitentiary, appears too vile to be made a member
cf the aldermanic body, and, indeed, the worse he is
the greater seems his pull.
Just now Chicago is engaged in a bitter and dis
graceful war. Not content with calling each other
thieves, which they probably are, the opposing forces
have taken to shooting. The only death thus far is
credited to the guns of Mayor Harrison's personal
following, and a paper owned by Yerkes directly
charges that the murder was with the connivance of
the Mayor, and that he is using his authority to
shield the assassins. There is no mincing of words in
this accusation, and the Mayor either is guilty or the
editorial department of Yerkes has been rash.
That such a municipal mess should blacken the
repute of a great city 15 in some measure a reflection
upon the whole country. The people of Chicag-o
ought to reform to the radical extent of refusing to
place their affairs in the hands of jailbirds, or per
haps supplying the birds with a suitable cage. They
ought to wipe all the expansive area of Chicago with
the battered remains of the ruffians who are now their
rulers, have a general clearing cut of salaried black
guards and finally become decent, law-abiding, and
thus in harmony with the environment of civilization.
When lawyers refuse to submit to the plan of a
night session of court, but devote the evening to the
witnessing of a prize fight, the time to inquire
"Whither are we drifting?" has rolled round again.
Our fatalities in the Philippines are greater than
; the islands are worth, but they are so small compared
to those of the enemy as to arouse suspicion that the
Filipinos are armed mostly with firecrackers.
Fayne Moore, a pretty woman, has been discharged
by a New York Judge, although she was the pal of a
man who received a sentence of nineteen years. In
other words, Fayne's face is her fortune.
Aguinaldo threatens to kill all Filipinos who refuse
to fight the Americans. As an instance of being be
tween the devil and the deep sea this has seldom been
equalled and never excelled.
A Missouiian of 103 years is on his way to Califor
nia, probably in quest of a climate under whose
salubrious influence he will have fair prospect of
reaching old age.
There is a suspicion that Governor Gage confounds
the administrative and legislative branches of the
State government. He occasionally thinks he is
both.
It cannot be the Philippines will '"prove a second
Klondike." Nobody will ever freeze to death there.

: Complaint was made to them a short j
j time ago that Arthur P. Rhodes, chief ;
" weigher, and "his" assistant, Thomas J. j
' Sharkey, had been absent from duty on j
several occasions when their services ;
: were most urgently required, and that j
j their absence was due 10 remorse of con- ;
l science following inordinate indulgence in [
j water-front whisky. The agents took up i
! the matter at once and called upon the ;
| accused men for an explanation. Both ;
{ sent in answers nicely typewritten deny- ]
ing- that they ever indulged to excess in j
the bowl that befuddles, and averring !
with due solemnity and virtuous indigna- j
tion that when they wore absent they ;
were sick â not because of dissipation, but '
j because of overwork.
Sharkey's answer was really pugilistic ;
|in tone, and th don't care a figitiveness j
. of his denial took away the breath of Col- ;
! lector Jackson for a few seconds after he ;
I had experience the felicity of reading it.
i Both Rhodes and Sharkey introduced doc- j
; tors' certificates assuring the agents that !
j those gentlemen were really sick when |
they were absent from work, which the;
agents, from other evidence in their pos- i
session, readily believed. These certiri- j
cares were backed up by affidavits to the
effect that Rhodes and Sharkey never j
drank anything stronger than water when j
on duty. These were strengthened by
1 affidavits from laborers and others in the ,
I same department, Sharkey vouching for ;â¢
i Rhodes, Rhodes vouching for Sharkey, ;
i and Assistant Weigher Douglas U. Quint j
i vouching for both. Then a similar charge ;
'â  of drunkenness was lodged against Quint, j
: and Rhodes and Sharkey vouched for the j
Immaculate sobriety of Quint.
These mutually friendly affidavits are .
corroborated, as it were, by several from !
the laborers in the department, and in- '
duced the agents to inquire more closely ;
into the matter. They found that the i
weighers and the laborers used to knock
Off work fr>r five or ten minutes at a time ;
! to go across the street and indulge in a '
) sociable bowl over a hospitable bar. Thus
was the mutuality of the affidavits ex- j
plained, and therefore there is much ap
prehension:ls the camp of the weighers, j
The agents learned a day or two ago i
: that Rhodes had been attempting to in- i
: timidate certain persons -who were to be |
: called as witnesses against him, and they
therefore requested Collector Jackson j
j yesterday to suspend Rhodes from duty ;
! pending the investigation, and to forbid
I him to come near the Custom-house until I
j sent for. The Collector made the order ;
i of suspension as requested by the agents, â 
I and the investigation will proceed with-'
i out further interruption.
It is claimed by the friends of Rhodes ;
I that he has been the victim of misfortune :
' rather than of indiscretion. It is said -
j that when he entered upon the duties of
his office he was in debt to small trades
men and others to the extent Of 52!Â»3, and
! that these creditors hounded him so per- ;
' sistently that he was obliged to set apart ;
$50 per month of his salary out of which j
!to pay them pro rata. After this arrange- j
! ment had been carried out to the satiffac- ;
i tion of his creditors for about three ;
' months his family were prostrated by :
1 sickness and he himself was quarantined ;
! in his house and finally taken down sick j
| himself. He had contracted doctors' bills
and bills for other necessary expenses,
and he was unable to continue the pay- !
â¢ ments to the prior creditors as promptly-;
' as they demanded, and the complaints ;
| were lodged against him, his friends say, j
for spite.

PRECEDENT IN GAME LAW.
, . . â
Rights of Superior Courts to Try-
Certain Criminal Cases.
An important decision relating to the
fish and game laws ur the. State was
'â  handed down by the Supreme Court yes
; terday. Tom Nop, a Chinese fisherman
! of San Diego, was arrested for violating j
; the laws regarding the catching of fish, j
> being charged under section 3r>3 of the j
! code. The Superior Court of San Diego,
! into which the case "was first taken, de-
I cided that it had no jurisdiction over the
matter. In case of a conviction the law j
says that the person "la guilty of a mis- \
demeanor, and is punishable by a fine of !
. not less than $100, or by imprisonment in j
the County Jail in the county in which
the conviction shall be had, not less than
fifty days, or by both such line and im
prisonment." â¢ * â¢
The case was of so much importance j
; that the entire court gave it full consid-
I eration. Justice Garoutte wrote the pre
â  vailing opinion and upon his recommen- \
dation the judgment of the lower court
was reversed. The main points consid
ered are seen in the following extracts
from the Justices' opinion:
"If the punishment to be inflicted
â¢ â¢ â¢ may not exceed $500 fine, or six
months' Imprisonment in the County Jail,
' then the offense is an ordinary misde
; meanor, of which the Superior Court has
mo jurisdiction. Bilt if the line may be
! greater than $500, or the imprisonment
may be for a longer term than six
months, then the Superior Court has jur-
I isdiction to try the case."
The court asks, "is there any law limit
! ing the scope and effect of the penalty
! provided by section 636?" The defendant
: claimed there is and pointed to section
19 of the Penal Code. The Supreme Court
does not consider that the point was well
taken, and says:
"If section 19 had never been enacted
i there would be no difficulty whatever in
! enforcing section- 636. and administering
punishments thereunder greater than $500
, fine or a six months' Imprisonment. In
I the absence of any kind of intimation by
. the law-making power that section 19 was
! purposed to limit the force and effect of
section 636, we cannot so hold. The judg
ment is reversed."
Justice Henshaw wrote a dissenting
j opinion, in which Chief Justice Beatty
j concurred. He said: "The conclusion
reached and declared by the prevailing
1 opinion is that a person found guilty of
: violating section 636 of the Penal Code
, may be punished by a fine to any amount
and. by an imprisonment for the term of
I his natural life."

MERRY TIME
IN THE HOUSE
OF MORAGHAN
James A. Is Rendered
Hors de Combat.
CAME HOME INTOXICATED
OCCASIONED EXCITEMENT IN
THE PROBATE COURT.
Judge Coffey Threatens an Attorney
With Imprisonment and Also
Decides Against His
Client.
Administration proceedings in the e3 :
tate of Julia A. Moragh'an as far as the
Superior Court is concerned closed yes
terday before Judge Coffey with a verbal
pyrotechnic display, visions of prison for
at least one attorney and indignation on
the part of the court. From out, of the
maze of dissension, however, Elsie Mo
rag-nan, decedent's daughter, walked vic
torious. The court had imposed upon her
the responsibility of handling the estate
until such time as it is ready for final
distribution. While Elsie was enjoying
the fruits of her victory, the sole person
who would deprive her of the pleasure,
her brother. James A. Moraghan. re
mained in his apartments and .nursed nu
merous discolored bumps .upon his per
son and planned to even an uneven score.
Shortly after the death of Mrs. Morag
han. who left property valued at about
550,000. including tne controlling interest
In the Moraghan Oyster Company, her
daughter. Elsie Moraghan, filed an appli
cation for letters of administration upon
her estate. James A .Moraghan was not
content to allow his sister to guide the
destiny of the estate In which he was
interested and he. too, riled a petition for
letters of administration. A3 the breech
between brother and sister grew apace
young Moraghan withdrew his applica
tion in favor of the Public Administra
tor, but rinally filed another.
Yesterday the matter of the various
applications came up for hearing. Dur
ing the course of proceedings it was
stated that a few nights ago James A.
had returned to his home in a state of
intoxication. From this statement argu
ment grew in which is was ascertained
that when young James A. returned to
his home in the condition of hilarity he
was met by a committee of three and so
severely damaged about the eyes that he
was not presentable, and in consequence
was unable to appear in court, greatly to
his disadvantage.
From the witnesses examined the story
of young Mioraghan's â¢â¢bat" gradually
came to light, and it is not without in
terest. It appears that the young. man
returned to his home and endeavored \o
make things tropical. He was set upon
by the committee of three, one of which
was his brother, but the committee ex
perienced great difficulty in handling
him. Finally the patrol wagon was rung
in for, but when It arrived, bearing two
burly policemen to the scene, ail was
ouiet. James A. was seated in a chair,
his legs securely tied, while his hands
were kept bus in an effort to cover all
bumps at once. James A. was bora de
combat, the committee was proud and
jubilant, so the police departed and left
young Moraghan to the Kindly mercy of
his conquerors.
During the proceedings in court yes
terday a few remarks were occasioned
when the treatment of James A. by the
committee of three was made public, and
finally Judge Coffey made a remark that
did not please the young mar. counsel,
especially so as an effort had been made
to transfer the rase to Judge Troutt's
court on allegations of Judge.. Coffey's
prejudice. When Judge Coffey made the
the displeasing remark Attorney D. E.
Mooney "excepted to the impertinent re
marks of the court."
When Judge Coffey recovered from . his
astonishment he informed the Attorney
that he thought the jail was yawning for
him for his contempt for the dignity of
the court. While Mooney was debating
to himself on the merits of .a few hours
in jail Judee Coffey decided the. case in
favor of Elsie Moraghan. Attorney Abe
Ruef was informed of the adverse rul
ing, for with young Mqraghan Ruefs
client, the Public Administrator, fell.
Ruef hurried into court and entered a
formal exception to the order of the
court and said that he would carry the
matter to the Supreme Court, as he did
not intend to be beat through the actions
of others, over whose temper he had no
control. j

The captain reports rough weather near

very high and rough sea were plentiful j
and the schooner's decks were half the !
time full of water. A number of sails !
were split at various times and all in all .
the Lewers had a disagreeable voyage.

reasonable grounds for suspecting that a
violation of the laws and ordinances of
the city was being contemplated.
Attorney Ach for the Jockey Club en
deavored to bolster up his case by repeat
ed interruptions in the way of propound- j
ing hypothetical questions to the oppos- j
ing counsel, but the answers he received
were not such as he probably anticipated j
or desired. District Attorney Murphy lis- ;
tened attentively to the argument - ad- j
vanced and from time to time offered sug- !
gestions to Mr. Mi Er.erney which the lat- ]
ter was prompt to avail himself of. Chief !
Lees was also an Interested spectator, sit- |
ting hind the District Attorney through ;
the greater part of the proceedings. Har- I
ry rbett dropped in during the after
noon and remained until the conclusion j
of Mr. McEnerney's argument. He was
the only representative of the pool-selling j
fraternity present during the day. Dis
trict Attorney Murphy will make the clos
ing argument for the respondents this {
morning. As a preliminary to the formal.!
presentation of his case Mr. McEnerney |
said :
"Inasmuch as this la a motion to set |
aside the modification of the injunction,
such modification naturally leaving the |
original injunction in full effect. It is not
out of the way for me here to dwell on the
merits and legality of the original injunc- j
Mr. McEnerney ridiculed the assump- !
tion that the police were debarred by law
from entering a public or quasi-public
place without the permission of the pro- j
prietors thereof unless armed with war
rants. He held that the duty of the po- ;
lice was as much to prevent the commis- j
sion of crime as to trace down the guilty |
and secure their punishment after a
crime had been committed, and he de
clared that a court of equity was not or
ganized for the purpose of interfering
with the criminal prosecution of violators
of the laws. Before a court of equity will
Interfere it must be shown that the dam
age to the complaining party is irrepara
ble, not alone by affidavit or allegation,
but by a clear presentation of facts. In
the present case the petitioners pretend- â 
ed to have suffered by the entrance of the !
police into the grounds of the Jockey
Club without paying- the regular admis
sion fee; by the jostling of the patrons
of the races by the police; by the conse
quent disinclination of the people to re
sort to a place liable to be raided by the j
officers of the law. and by the taking of ;
personal property without due warrant, of
law. He contended that for any damage
suffered by the petitioners through any
or all of these acts they had ample re- '
course in damage suits against the re- j
spondests, individually or collectively. I
He argued, however, that the respondents |
had, in entering the premises of the peti
tioners, exercised their legal rights by I
common law.
"The exercise of his legal right by one i
man cannot result In legal injury to an- !
other," argued the attorney. "Therefore !
if the police enter the racetrack grounds,
even by the payment of the admission
fee or otherwise, they cannot injure the
proprietors, even if the patrons of the
place do flee, and the police cannot be en
joined from arresting persons discovered
in the act of violating the law. or for jost
ling those whom they arrest."
The attorney cited numerous authorities
in support of his argument that the po
lice did not exceed their authority in
forcing an entrance into the racetrack for
the purpose of preventing the commission
of crime. He knew of no decision exactly j
covering' the present case, although ho
quoted many cases in which the princi
ples involved were the same and urged
that the present afforded an excellent
opportunity for the court to render an
opinion in this specific case in line with
other decisions in conflicts between the
police authorities and known violators of
the law.
"The rule is -well established," said the
attorney, "that he who comes into equity
must come with clean hands. It Is a no
torious fact that the plaintiffs in this case
have been conducting/what is known In
common law as a disorderly house and
that gambling has been permitted to
flourish unrestricted on their grounds, all
of which is detrimental to public morality
and decency. In view of these known
facts I say an injunction restraining the
police from entering the racetrack, forci
bly or otherwise, for the purpose of put
ting a stop to this violation of the law
Will not lie. A court of equity cannot be j
successfully invoked by violators of the :
law to protect them from punishment {or
their misdeeds. A court of equity cannot
permit its process to be perverted to any
such purpose. The authority of a court
of equity certainly cannot be invoked to
enjoin the officers of the law from per
forming their duty, although in a manner
regarded possibly as oppressive by the i
plaintiffs, and restraining them for no
other purpose than that these plaintiffs
may go on with their violations of the law
unmolested. The police are authorized by
law to enter any and all public places at
any and al! times.
"The whole question is whether these
gentlemen shall permit the law to be vio
lated on their premises: whether the court
is to permit an Injunction to run against
one of the chief department? in this city
necessary to preserve law and order."
At the" conclusion of Mr. McEr.erney's
argument District Attorney Murphy an
nounced thai the subject had been so
thoroughly covered by his associate that
there was* very little he could add. He
thought he would not need more than a
half hour to present his views under the
circumstances, and with that understand
ing the case was adjourned until &:'! ! i
this morning.

JV is the only medicine I have found that has done me any good.
Before taking your medicine, I was all run down, tired ail the

\ Another Tumor Successfully Expelled. %
W "Two years ago I was a great suffeier from womb trouble
and profuse flowing each month, and tumors would form in
Jfc the womb. I had four-tumors in two years. I went through *x
f^ treatment with doctors, but they did me no good, and I thought
Â£p I would have to resort to morphine. The doctor said that all f
that could help me was to have an operation and have the womb jL
XT' removed, but I had heard of Mrs. Pinkham's medicine and de- $*
cided to try it, and wrote for her advice, and after taking her |Â»
Vegetable Compound the tumors were expelled and I began to

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. March 2Â«.â Strength prevailed
nearly all day In the stock market, with total
dealing; 5 of over a million shares. The effect
of extensive realizing was not felt until near
the close, when the tone was easy; but reces
sions still left material advances in many
s.tpcks. London after some early purchasing I
sold freely on the advance here, but the stock !
was well taken. Sterling exchange was strong
and th* money easier. Call money, which
hud touched 6 per cent, was loaned at the
close at 4'i. An incident bringing forth fav
orable comment was the week's increase of
over a million in exports of merchandise.
Practically the only laggards in the list wera
the Morgan stock*, including the coalers, I
Louisville, Atchlson preferred and Manhattan.
The latter was weak on threatened increase In
the competition by the underground road which
the Metropolitan Company offered to construct.
! Metropolitan jumped to 'IVZ at the opening on
the assumption that it would profit by an
underground railway, l><Â»ing thus relieved of
the land haul on its surface cars. The stock
laier lost two points of its advance. lie
conspicuous strength of Northwest, which
made a net advance of 7*4 after an extreme
advance of â  five points more, had a good ef
fect on other ways, particularly the Van
derbllu Pacifies. Omaha rising 2% points. The
decrta^a of February surplus earnings for Bur
lington had a momentary depressing effect on
; the stock, but It closed at about the best.
Sruirar on comparatively moderate dealings rose
I\i, retaining more than half of its advance.
T'-.bao'.o stocks wt-re sharply advanced In an
ticipation of the increased capitalisation of the
American Tobacco Company at the stockhold
ers' meeting to-day. Brooklyn Transit ad
â \a_nced five points and Consolidated Gas four,
while American Tin Plate and People's Oas
also showed strength. One reason assigned for
the strength In a number of the standard rail
. frays wfi.-- the re investment of money received
by the sale of Chicago and Alton stock to the
.purchasing syndicate. The advance In North
. west. Union Pacific and New York Central
was coupled in some quarters with expressions
of confidence that the roads would be amalga
mated, although this story recently met em
phatic denials from the Vanderbllt interest.
The bond rcarket moved .strongly upward in
sympathy with the stock movements. Total
eales, J4,450,000.

CHICAGO MARKETS.
CHICAGO, March Milder weather and a
I heavy fall of snow over a large section of the
winter wheat country gave wheat a weak start.
Liverpool sent lower quotations to begin with
j and still lower at a later stage. New York
, wired that foreigners were selling freely at the
j seaboard. The Southwest, which has of late
1 been the beet buyer, turned seller. Local
shorts had covered so freely recently that the
1 market got little support from that interest, !
I and with so much in the situation that was ;
against the price liquidation gradually carried
the price down. There was a marked falling
oft in crop damage complaints. - It was not
claimed that the winter crop damage, which re
cently has so harrowed up the feelings of
speculators, has been repaired. Nevertheless
the action of the market suggested an im
i pression that some such idea prevailed In the !
! pit. Atlantic port clearances of wheat and
: flour were 154,000 bushels. An Improvement of
! 1@24 centimes at' Antwerp and a report of the
i Orange Judd Farmer making the average con
dition of winter wheat 82.1, against 53. 6 last,
' year, were the Incentives that arrested the i
! decline. Bradstreet's statement of 759.Q00
bushels decreased world's visible supply had j
; a slightly bullish effect, but the bulls were not
: aggressive, while the bears were Inclined to
i press the advantage already gained, so that
I no permanent material improvement was ef
! fected. May wheat opened 4'9"%c lower at
from 71% c down to 714 c, sold sparingly at
71% c and from that gradually down to 70 7
: and in the final struggle to 70% c. It closed
with buyers at 70% c.
Corn was heavy on quite a moderate amount
I of speculative trade. The weakness of wheat
' was the chief Influence and lower quotations
1 from Liverpool likewise helped. May corn
! closed %c lower.
Oats were weak and lower, due to the lib
! eral selling by longs and the easiness of wheat
i and corn. May oat 6 lost 4'9%c.
Selling by packing concerns, which have re
recently been the best buyers, weakened pro
â  visions. The weakness of grain? and lack '
of speculation assisted in the decline. May !
pork lost 15c. lard 10c and ribs 74c.

AVAILABLE GRAIN SUPPLY.
-
NEW YORK. March 28.â Special cable and
telegraphic advices to Bradstreet's indicate the
â  following changes in the available supplies of
â  grain last Saturday, as compared with tha
: preceding Saturday:
"heat, United States and Canada, east of
; the Rockies, increase, 311,000 bushels; Liver
pool Corn Trade News, afloat lor and in Eu
rope, decrease, 1,100,000. Total supply, decrease.
789,000 bushels.
Corn, United States and Canada, east of the
Rockies, decrease, 122, "00 bushels.
Oats. United States and Canada, east of the
Rookies, increase, 114,000 bushels.
'The aggregate stocks of whuat held at Port
land Or., and Tacoma and Seattle, Wash.,
decreased 113,000 bushels during the week.
CITRUS FRUITS IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, March 28.â The Journal of
Commerce says: Notwithstanding the fact
that supplies of lemons in jobbers' hands are j
1 reported to be quite full the market appears :
1 to be much firmer than at this time a week
I ago. Recent arrivals have shown a rather
I small percentage of good shipping stock, par
> ticularly of the email fancy grades, and these,
I being especially wanted, are held with confi
dence, and It is believed that with even mod
erate demand cricks will keep up to their
present level for some time to come.
On ordinary grades the feeling is steady and
jobbing grades have gone back to the fig
ures rullnc before the sale on last Tuesday
i of the Nuttield cargo which was characterized
â  by a prominent broker as one of the worst
' that ever came to New York. The fruit was ,
. all right when the vessel left Sicily, but the
; cargo shifted in transit, and consequently a
! lar<e number of boxes were badly damaged.
At present writing there are no cargoes In
' port unsold, but three vessels are hourly ex
pected. They are the Queen Moor with 33,400
boxes the California with 6200 boxes and the
New Quay with 25,500 boxes. It had been in
tended, we understand, to Fell the first on
Tuesday, the second on Wednesday and the
third probably on Friday. The Hexham. With
21,000 boxes, is also expected about the end
of the week.
While ehinments of lemons from primary
ports have been liberal of late, as shown by our
list of steamships sailed and about to **' A
a prominent jobber, speaking of the statistics
position, said: "Weekly statements of sup
plies float and at the wharf unsold Indicate
clearly that shipments from Sicilian ports are
decreasing and th.- quantity now in sight is |
assuming normal proportions. During the next j
' thirty or forty days 270,000 boxes of lemons
! will be placed on the market, against n:>,000
boxes for the same time, last year and nearly
300 000 boxes in 1897. In 1596 the total quan-
t ity available during the corresponding period
! was 'in round numbers, 400,000 boxes. The
' average loss to importers at current prices is
i said to be 60c per box. and operations will
naturally be on more conservative lines.

THE STOCK MARKET.

TVTtnlnt; storks were rather better, though
business continued quiet
The regular W> cents per share quarterly divi
dend Of the Market Street Railway Company
will be paid on April 10.
The weekly report of the manager of the
pumping operations says: "No pumping has
been <lor.p during the past wp^k. The pump-
Ing association has been engaged in doing work
for several of the mining companies, as ap
pears by their weekly letters. The rearranged
â¢ ir is suspended in the shaft and will
be lowered. There have been a number of de
lays in getting the pump into the shaft, due
to the fact that a great many changes had
to be made to accommodate the new work.
Thl? elpvatc.r is to be sent down nearly 100
feet lower into the water in the shaft than
the first one used, and the providing of the
w(1 vÂ« and means for handling this additional
weight has taken up a good deal or time. The
shaft has been examined by means of sound
ing devices, and found to be free of obstruc
tions for 225 feet below the 1750 station, or aa
deep as the soundings were made, so that no
trouble Is anticipated in lowering the elevator
and columns to the depth of 200 feet below the
1750 station. The water stands now at a
point twelve feet below the 1750 station In
the C. and C. â¢baft, where It was before we
started pumping. Part of this rise is due to
the water used in flooding the Consolidated
California and Virginia stopes between the 1650
and 1750 levels." :â â (.â

.â¢:â  DRUG CLERK.
He Would . Uot Positively Identify
',_..- the _' Defendant â An Appren
â .- "tlce Who Was Too
Tidy.
The Adar-is case has progressed as far
fs a three-ounce bottle and part of a red
label. 1 They were both the subjects of
rr.uch time and attention before Judge
Barry yesterday; and if the woman who
purchased the bottle can only be identi
fied as;. : Mrs. Adams, it will go
h?.rd "yv-ttlv -the. defendant. Already the
ertpmen on the Geary-street car has tesxi
f.vd that a woman who boarded his car
on the reyenlhg of March 12 was Mrs.
Adams; and Policeman Herllhy Says she
was the.. yon: an who came out of the drug
store, anil lore the label, a red label, off
a boUle.\" Yesterday George Purlenky
leitijipd â ' that Herlihy brought the label
back-Jnto the store and that it came from
tr.e bottle of carbolic acid he had sold
Just before. ' Mrs. Adams has denied that
s'r.e Is ft " the- house that evening.
Crii\yv'C'6x, th.egr'pman, was called to
the â  st&Ed ;';rst yesterday afternoon to al

This rirae counsel for the deft-rise made
a mistake. They had successfully object
ed to- xfae introduction of the clerk's
porson register on the ground that it was
irrelevant. 'Â» and then they proceeded to
ask questions which necessitated a refer
ence to the beok. When they had done
Mr. Carpenter, the Prosecuting Attorney,
offered the book again, and this time it
was accepted in evidence.
Ther#> was also much stress laid on the
fact that before the Coroner's jury Pur-
Jf-r.ky had testified thai the woman's cape
hung as low as ht;r hips, and yesterday
he said it hung but to her elbows. This
was ar.s,tvcrfcd by the prosecution by
showing that the counter and showcase
stood higher than the "woman's waist and
the clerk could " not have seen the fur
trimming had the cape hung much below
her elbows:

store at. Geary and Devisadero streets,

found the p:eoe of the torn label behind a
bonle on the shelf, where Purlenky testi

:>?â  cors*ijuer.ce he had swept it out. His
ci.scriu'icr. of the "piece of the label and
wtereifcs had found it tallied with the

Fred Foster seems to be out of luck'
with his auger-legged sprinter Abuse.

tosed favorite in the bet-
ting.
Of the other five events run off favor
ites took but two. The track was good,
but not fast, the performance of Top
mast in the mile and a sixteenth event :
being the best of the afternoon.
The Baldwin entry, Ed Salado, looked
like a pretty fair proposition in the open- â¢
ing event, a sprint over the Futurit>
course. Still the books all seemed will- j
ing to take the coin in. on the mare, and t
many took the old "hunch"â beware of
long odds. Ruiz had the mount, and if j
she was possessed of any speed he was j
unable to make her show it. Her show- :
ing- was a frightful one. Horatio, the sec
ond choice, came in for steady support
and won in a hard drive from February.
In the six-furlong run following Juva
showed herself to be a clever repeater. ;
Starting a 9 to 10 favorite, she led from .
the start, winning in a romp from i
Yaruba. I
The start In the two-year-old scramble ;
had something to do with the defeat of
the favorite Mountebank, ridden by Pig
gott. Galene slipped away in the lead
ar.d shortly after the barrier was released j
Hennessy, astnke Loch Katrine, cut the !
tirst choice off. Galene. however, could j
not be lost, finishing third. In a haro.
drive Loon Katrine reached the wire halt
a length before Tar Hill.
Dr. Sheppard, another from the string
of Fred Foster, came to grief in the mi!Â»
and a sixteenth recital. The Doctor ruled ;
a warm favorite, and after racing head j
and head- into the stretch with Pat Mor- I
rissev the pair were easily beaten out j
by Thorpe on Topmast, the second choice.
Driving hard, the favorite took the place
from Morrissey by a head.
The final mile and a furlong selling run j
was only a gallop for Wheel of Fortune. ;
The mare ruled an odds-on choice and j
won easing up from Ulm.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, AVEDXESDAY, MARCH 29, 1899.
Baldwin that unless' his stable of horses
run more consistently In future his en
tries would be refused.
From advices received at the track yes
terday it appears that Dan Honig's horses
met with disaster at a station near Ba
kersfield called Bagdad. â¢ The car was
consumed by fire, and The Swain, Our
Climate and four two-year-olds wore In
cinerated. Rosebeau and Schiller, be
longing to Barney Schreiber, and Ed
Gartland. Zamar 11. Fortunate and a
maiden three-year-old, the property of
Honig. were saved, according to report.
Young Mills, who cleverly piloted St.
Calatlne, Is in a peck of trouble over a
contract. He was taken from an orphan
age by the St. Louis firm of Cella & Sippy
and last winter came to California with
Caesar Young. Dissatisfied, the exercise
boy left Young and placed himself under
the protection of an Emeryville Justice of
the Peace. Yesterday Judge Murphy re
ceived a wire from Cella & Sippy. asking
him to restrain Mills from further riding
and stating that they would forward a
copy of their contract. The matter will
then be passed upon by the Oakland offi

SPECULATION ON
MRS. STANFORD'S
SALE OF STOCK
University Likely to

BOON FOR THE INSTITUTION
THE DEAL MAY MEAN MUCH
TOR PALO ALTO.
Possession of Two Millions in Cash
Would Enable the Widow to
Carry Out Her Plans for
the University.
The action of Mrs. Jane L. Stanford in
-:ng of her holdings of Central Pa
cific stock, by which she realized nearly
... â¢â¢ : â  ws of which has just been
made public, was the subject of much
speculation in this city yesterday. It is
tak-n for granted that the proceeds of the
sale will be devottJ, largely If not wholly.
to the university at Palo Alto, the pride
ar.d glory of the late Senator Stanford's
widow. The only ground for this conclu-
sion, to be sure, is the well-known fact
that Mrs. Stanford has for some time had
in contemplation various schemes of im
provement in connection with the institu
tion of learning founded and so liberally
endowed by her husband, which have
been held in abeyance because of lack of
funds; but as it is equally a matter of
public knowledge that the one ambition,
of Mrs. Stanford's life is to further em
bellish and expand this magnificent mon
ument to the memory of her only son, the
conclusion seems amply justified.
Ever since the death of Senator Stan
ford his widow has encountered obstacles
in her efforts to provide the necessary
funds for the maintenance of the univer
sity on the scale originally contemplated
by its founder, obstacles due to the litiga
tion in connection with the settlement of
tne vast estate, which tied up, a goodly
portion of its income for several years,
and other causes which it is not necessary
to mention. At times these obstacles have
threatened to seriously interfere with her
plans, and it was only by the most ener
getic efforts on her part, coupled with ex
tremely good management, that Mrs. Stan
ford was enabled to provide the funds
necessary to keep the doors of the institu
tion open to the young men and women
anxious to secure a finished education.
Within the past few years these difflcul
. â¢ â¢ m. asure tx - â¢
moved, but at the same lime the erection
of new buildings and provision for addi
tional courses, necessitating: the expendi
ture of large sums, have been delayed,
owing to the trouble experienced in pro
viding the money needed to carry these
plan? to successful consummation. With
the acquisition of nearly (2 â  imme
â  . it is believed Mrs. Stan
-â¢â e her way clear to carry
out her plans in this regard.

who might be possessed of information on
the subject I - taik. believing that
Mrs. Stan: drat to take
the public Into her confidence. George
Crocfcer, who was In New York when the
deal by which Mrs. Stanford succeeded
ln disposing of her stock was completed,
practically admits the truth of the facts
as published, but declines to be Inter
viewed.
"I was surprised to see the articles on
the subject in the morning papers.'" he
said last night, "and any further informa
hould T>me from Mr?.
Stanford. It la a matter that concerns her
alone, and until - ly to talk of h^r
action and her plans. I must decline to do
bo. I will not even admit that I know
anything about the matter."
There s^ms to be little doubt, however.
that the sale was Inspired by a desire on
nrt of Mrs. Stanford to secure a
larce sum of n for the use of
â¢ [veralty, and an era of unexampled
prosperity appears in be dawning on the
seat of learning at Palo Alto.
HER INVESTMENT.
Mrs Stanford Believed to Have
Bought Southern Pacific
Bonds.
NEW YORK, March 2S.â The report
from Par. Francisco that Mrs. Leland
Stanford has sold her Central Pacific
stock to Speyer & Co. of this city has
â¢r.f.rmed at the office of that firm.
The stock was bought by Speyer & Co.

YOUNG STUDEBAKER
AS A PLAYWRIGHT
Son of the Wagon Magnate Will
Organize His Own Theatri
cal Troupe.
PETER E. STI'DEBAKER JR.. sen of the famous wagon manufacturer
of Chicago, will blossom forth very shortly as a full-fledged playwright.
The young heir to the Studebaker millions is at present stopping at
the Palace Hotel, where he is finishing- a vivid romantic drama entitled
"Sword and Scepter."
The drama was written entirely by young Studebaker and is of the
same school as "Under the Red Robe 1 and "The Prisoner of Zenda,"
While the vein of the drama runs along the same lines as these famous
:h- re is nothing in Mr. Btudebaker's drama that borders on r-a
glarlam. The your.tr man's literary effort has been closely criticised by some
of the most competent critics in the United States, all of whom speak in
the hiehos: praise of his nroduction. Mr. Stude'oaker intends to select a
company o: high-class artists to produce the play. He will organize his
company during the summer and in the fall I m this city to make

his real character and to add weight to
his testimony he poses as a tobacco mer

as to having set-: In China a year

tt made a quiet investigation into
the present standing and the antecedents
of the pretended merchant. They found
that he had not b*en connected in any

had b* S recently packing cases

trncc-d him from place to place and finally
': a washhcuse on Washington

merchant, with his sleeves rolled up and
his mi- t water squirting upon a

THE OLD WAY
Of Treating Dyspepsia and Indiges-
tion by Dieting a Dangerous-
and Useless One. â¢ . ,' V
We say the old way. but" really ifis
a very common one at present time and
many dyspeptics and physicians a3
well consider the first step-, to take la
attempting to cure indigestion is to
' diet, either by selecting certain foods-
and rejecting others or to greatly di-
i minish the quantity usually taken, in
] other words, the starvation plan is by
i many supposed to be the first essential.
The almost certain failure of the star-
vation cure for dyspepsia has been
' proven time and again, but still the
I moment dyspepsia makes its appear-
l ance a course of dieting is at once ad-
| vised.
All this is radically wrong. It is fool-
: ish and unscientific to recommend diet-
s ing or starvation to a man suffering
from dyspepsia, because indigestion
itself starves every organ and every
nerve and every fiber in the body.
What the dyspeptic wants is abund-
i ant nutrition, which means plenty of
! good, wholesome, well cooked food and
i something to assist the weak stomach
Ito digest it. This is exactly the pur-
I pose for which Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
! lets are adapted and this Is the method
i by which they cure the worst cases of
| dyspepsia, in other words the patient
i eats plenty of wholesome food : and
I Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets digest it
i for him. in this way the system is
; nourished and the overworked stomach
j rested, because the tablets will digest
! the food whether the stomach works
!or not. One of these tablets will digest
3000 grains of meat or eggs.
Your druggist will tell you that

FOR A DIVORCE

Complaint Filed.
A CONVICT WITH FIVE WIVES

TO JOIN HIM AGAIN.

Intercede.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 28.
â¢ Mme. Millie Edeau Gay has finally de
cided to rid herself of her convict hus
t>and, Willis B, Gay, who was sent to San
I Quentin in February, 1897. to serve three
years for bigamy.
Her divorce- complaint, prepared by At
torney H. B. Griffith, was tiled in the
Superior Court late this afternoon, and
the ground upnn which she bases her ac
tion is that Willis B. Gay has been con
victed of a felony.
The parties were married in Colorado :
; about six years ago,, but the season of j
happii â  was of short duration, for Gay
goon deserted his wife and her daughter
[lay a former husband named Edeau, and
came to California.
Possessed of a gllbness of tongue that
& Chicago drummer would envy, Gay
coon found employment as manager of a j
i large Alan tea store.
' In the Enclnal City Gay met Miss May
â¢^rcGarford at Mrs. Spencer's private
boardinar-house on Oak street. He whis
pered sweet nothings into her ears, and i
: a buggy ride on January 8, 1897, resulted
in a marriage on the same day. Since >
then it has been said that this made
Gay's fifth matrimonial enterprise. Still
'nothing could be learned definitely of any
previous wives save Mrs. Millie Edeau-
Gay present plaintiff, and the bigamous
Gay' has never confessed to having had
more than two." !â¢â¢_..
Mme. Edeau-Gay soon heard of her hus- :
band's' bigamous conduct and hurried to |
the coast, and while the erring man was |
Tmskir.g in the rays of the honeymoon
with wife No. 2 she appeared at .their
homo in Alameda and created a stormy
ecene. which culminated in Gay's arrest
on a charge of bigamy. While in the Ala
meda City Prison Mrs. Gay No. 2 was al
most constantly with her illegally ac
quired spouse, and though he plead*
guilty witnout much ado she declared by
all that was holy she would cling by him
until death should decree otherwise. Gay
was sentenced to three years' imprison
ment, and his term expires in a few
months. What has become of Mrs. Gay
No. 2 is not known, but it is Buposed that
pho is- close by awaiting his liberation,
when they will be legally made man and
â¢wife.
Mrne. Edeau-Gay, instead of returning
to her old home in Colorado, settled down
In Oakland, opening a dressmaking par
lor. â¢ Since Gay's incarceration at San
Quentin he has frequently written letters
to her asking her forgiveness and seek- !
ing to rekindle the old love flame, not
â withstanding Mrs. Gay continued to vow
vengeance and to trail him to the ends of j
the earth for his wrong, even after he
should be again freed. So eager was Gay
to consummate a reconciliation that he
tried to Influence Chaplain Drahms at San
Quentin- to exercise his offices in that be
half. Gay's love-making took an end,
and now Mrs. Gay seeks a legal separa
tion. _

Causes Dissent.
THE CAPITALIST NOW ILL
HIS BON DISAGREES WITH HIS
STEPMOTHER.
Dissatisfaction in the Family of the
Aged Pioneer â Already the
Estate Has Been Ap
praised.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
pns Broadway. March 28.
Volnpy D. Moody, one of the wealthiest
and certainly host-known men in this
county, is suffering from paralysis and no
relief can be afforded him. He is at his
home in Berkeley and although a year
has elapsed since the last attack his con
dition is regarded as critical.
Already there is prospect of a contest
over the capitalist's vnst estate. A son of
the capitalist by his first wife has learned
the terms of his father's latest will and
has expressed his dissatisfaction. He does
not consider that his father is competent
to attend to his own business and may
apply for a guardian to be appointed.
Mr. Moody is one of the early residents
of California. Just half a century ago on
this date Mr. Moody and his parents
started from Wisconsin to cross the plains
with ox teams to California. They ar
rived In San Bernardino County in De
cember and finally were located in the
Pulgas redwoods in San Mateo County.
where Volney D. Moody engaged in the
lumber business. In 1850 he came to Oak
land, purchased a sawmill in what is now
East Oakland, and afterward went East,
purchased a band of horses and drove

them across the plains to California. A\\
his ventures were successful and in 1574
he organized the First National Bank of
Oakland and was its president for many
Mr Moody married twice and therein
lies the secret of the unhappiness which
clings around the close of his long, active
and successful life. His lirst wife was
Adeline Wright, whom he married in 1564.
The result of this union was three child
ren. William 8., Nellie E. and Mrs. \V. F.
Blood.
Some time after his separation from his
first wife Mr. Moody married his present
wife, who was Mrs. Robinson. She has
two daughters by her first husband and
unpleasantness exists between the two
families. Recently Mr. Moody made a
Will and his son declares that its terms
are not just to the children of his first
Speaking of the matter to-day W. B.
Moody said: "I am not satisfied partly
because 1 have not been able to see my
father alone for a long time. Whenever
I go to see him either Mrs. Moody or her
daughter is always present, and I feel
that I am watched. My father has made
several wills and they are altogether too
favorable to his wife, and I understand
that Fome deeds have already passed to
Mrs Moody. My father has suffered so
much from paralysis that I do not think
him competent to make a will."
Mrs Moody admits that there is a lit
t'e family unpleasantness and attributes
it parti v to the fact that, about two years
ago Will Moody met with an accident on
8 yacht whl<-h resulted in deafness, and
tide she thinks, has made him Buspicious.
Mr Moody is now ill. but his mind is
good and no one is guarding him to pre
vent his being seen by his family. Mrs.
Moody says that the stories are being cir
culated for a very plain purpose and re
grets that such unhappiness should D*
made public at a time when the central
figure of the family is in such a condition
that he cannot explain them away.
Anticipating trouble some time ago Mr.
Moody had his estate appraised by three
of his closest friends, who placed the
figures at $400.00(1
DIVINE REVELATION IN
BRANDES MURDER CASE
A SURPRISE FOR THE DISTRICT
ATTORNEY.
A Crank Tin burdened His Mind of a
Great Secret Regarding the
Murder.
OAKLAND, March 28.â Tho Brandes
murder case has resulted in unhinging the
mind of at least one person, though his
name has not been learned. A stranger
called on Deputy District Attorney Mel
vin to-day and Bought an interview with
that official regarding what he announced
as a very important matter concerning
the accused murderer. Ho was accorded
a bearing;.
"1 have divine knowledge about the
case." said the stranger, to the surprise
of the prosecutor. "It has been revealed
to me that Brandos had not been giving
his daughter Lillian proper training and
education, and because of this the girl
deliberately hanged herself." The speaker
here- stopped as though his heart had been
relieved of a heavy burden, and grace
fully he bowed himself out of the District
Attorney's office, refusing to give his
name. Before insane Keeper Keating of
the Receiving Hospital could be notified
the fellow had made good his escape.
The noted murder trial was again con
tinued this morning until to-morrow, ow
ing to the indisposition of Juror Benja
min Marston, who has been very sick
since last Thursday, when an adjourn
ment was taken on that account.

LEWISTON, Me., March 6. 1899.
To the First Free Baptist Church, Oakland.
Peopre: For a period of four
years I have sustained to you the sweet and
sk.lv relation ol a pastor, aad now that duty
clearly calls nic to a wider field 1 profoundly
feel the pathos of severing ties that, with each
y.-ar have grown stronger and more precious.
Kare'ly has a pastor a social atmosphere more
congealal helpers more loyal, yoke-fellows
more eager and united and a congregation more
: iu'tW- and appreciative than you have
proved yourselves to be to me.
Indeed, you are very dear to my heart, and
as; l^ne as life lasts the memory of your de
votion and love will quicken and cheer me and
kindle- In me the highest emotions of gratitude
and attachment. Hut having been unexpect
eillv and as I believe, divinely summoned to
assume charge of the Main-street Free Baptist
Church of this city I hereby tender my resig
nation of your pastorate, to take effect Im
mediately. I do this with a keen pang of re
gret for my relations to you have been so
uniformly happy, and my impressions of the
Oakland clergy and people po richly delightful.
May the God of peace and Joy, penterostal
power and victory be with you evermore,
amen. Yours sincerely. PHlt-IP GRAIF.
In explaining; his resignation Dr. Graif
says that the Bates College Church, to
which he has been called, is a pastorate
of much importance. "Equipped with a
prestige and power of a large and lnHu
entiar church," he writes, "there are of
course many workers of first-class gifts
and acquirements. The pews are well
filled the music is of a high order and a
leading percentage of the city s elite are
wont to worship within its sacred walls,
and hence It affords me a splendid lever
age for doing good."
Dr. Graifs resignation has been ac
cepted. ,
MARY'S LIST OF
CRIMES COMPLETED
REMARKABLE LOVE FOR HER
WORTHLESS HUSBAND.
She Shared With Mollie Traynor the
Record for Disgrace and
Criminality.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 28.
An Inquest will be held to-morrow morn
ing on Mary Pipenberg. In the annals of
crime and degradation of this city for the
past ten years two young women figured
more than all the rest put together. Sev
eral months ago Mollie Traynor ended her
life with poison. Last night Mary Pipen
berg followed her example.
The Pipenbergs have lived for ten years
upon crime. There never has been a time
in which husband or wife was not in jail
or awaiting trial. Charles Pipenberg is
now serving a long sentence in San Quen
tin. For many years this notorious
couple exercised enough ingenuity to pre
vent being convicted of a felony, and their
sentences were therefore limited to short
terms in the County Jail. The woman 3
intense regard for her worthless husband
was remarkable. Many times he was ar
rested for beating her, and while serving
his short sentence she would carry all
kinds of delicacies to the jail, frequently
receiving nothing but curses for her trou
ble When her husband was released she
well knew that his first work would be to
get drunk and then to abuse her. This
went on for years, and finally they were
separated when Pipenberg was sent across
\ few' years ago Pipenberg and a police
officer named Banks, now a fugitive from
justice plotted to convict a man of a bur
glary in West Oakland. The plot was suc
cessful and he wa-s convicted. Efforts
were made to secure his release by prov
ing the worthless character of both Banks
and Pipenberg, but they failed. Mary
Pipenberg after her husband's incarcera
tion at San Quentin, frequently told of the
secret plot. She was but 27 years old,
though her list of crimes is as long as
though she had lived twice that length of
time.
BEQUEATHS ESTATE
AND LITIGATION
WILL OF GEORGE W. DENT FILED
FOE. PROBATE.
Interests in Vast Tracts Given to
Heirs, but the Land Is Not
Theirs.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 28.
The olographic will of George W. Dent,
who died in Berkeley last January, was
filed this afternoon by Public Adminis
trator Hawes, who asks for letters on
the estate; the widow, Mary I. Dent, and
son-in-law, Julius C. Rois, who are named
as executors, having filed their renuncia
tion at the same time.
Although the estimated value of the
estate is given as $10,000, the will provides
for bequests of extensive lands in Cali
fornia and Missouri, in which testator
asserts valuable interests under the Old
Spanish grants ami which is involved in
litigation. The will is dated June ti, 1893,
and at the time of its execution testator
was over To years of age. He claimed re
lationship to the late General Ulysses S.
Grant. By its terms the widow is to re
ceive all money deposited in banks and
received from a life insurance policy. To
.M;i ml M. Dent, a granddaughter, is be
queathed a house and lot at Georgetown,
El Dorado County, California, while all
other lands anil mining properties at
Georgetuwn belonging to the estate are
bequeathed to two grandsons, George S.
Dent and W. S. Dent. The Marshall
Tract, located in the vicinity of Mission
Creek, San Francisco, is left to the
widow.
The will then recites that testator had
already provided for the daughter, Ellen
\V. Reis. "But I hereby bequeath to
her." continues the instrument, "my in
terest in the property in St. .Louis County,
Missouri, commonly called the fields of
Carondelet (now part of St. Louis), which
certain trustees under a Spanish grant
leased for ninety.-nine years, but which
will revert to me; also all my interest in
the swamp lands known as part of the
grant to Antonio Peralta on the flats of
the encinal opposite San Francisco, in the
county of Alameda and contiguous to the
city-- of Oakland and town of Alameda,
now claimed by the railroad companies
'b.y might and not by right.' "
Attorney I.in Church, who with Charles
Snook represents Public Administrator
Hawes, stated to-day that while Mr.
Dent at one time owned extensive In
terests In the vast properties he ostensibly
dlsposes of by will, his interests at pres
ent are practically nil.

MRS. MARY MILLER'S
SANITY QUESTIONED
SON-IN-LAW PERCY ASKS FOR
AN EXAMINATION.
She Thinks Her Relatives Desire to
Poison Her and Eats a Great
Quantity of Salt.
ALAMEDA, March 2S.â Mrs. Mary Mil
ler, a lady 75 years of age, was taken to
the Oakland Receiving Hospital late this
afternoon by her son-in-law, J. A. Percy
of 1375 Regent street, who wished her to
be examined as to her sanity. The parties
are prominent and In affluent circum
stances, and these facts have created con
siderable comment as to Percy's treat
ment of his aged mother-in-law.
To the attendants at the hospital the old
lady stated that she was perfectly sano
and was "being railroaded to an asylum"
by relatives, who have been striving to
gain possession of her property. She saya
that she owns considerable rent-producing
property in the vicinity of Salinas which
has been In charge of her son-in-law,
Percy, who has collected the income hut
fulled to render an accounting to her. The
attendants at the hospital state that Mrs.
Miller appears quite sane and does not
show the least symptoms of being de
ranged. Mr. Percy was not to be seen
to-night.
Neighbors state that while Mrs. Miller
has acted queerly at times she was never
considered a lunatic. Her peculiarities
"were an unusual appetite for salt" and
"the notion that her relatives were at
tempting to poison her." She is reputed
to be quite wealthy. Percy Is a well-to-do
rancher of Salinas, who has made his
home in this city for the last two years.
His son, J. A. Percy Jr., is connected with
the firm of Pierson & Mitchell, the attor
neys, of San Francisco.

Saturday â Concert by the Wo

RERKELKY, March 2S.â Next Saturday
aftornoon has been set as the time for
holding the University of California

ships, but also as an interclass affair be

from these two classes winning places
will accordingly have the points counteJ
for their class score.

Nevada track team to the University of
California freshmen has been accepted by
the latter. They will go to Reno on May
12. Places on the team will be decided by
the results of next Saturday's field day.

A large audience greeted them and ap
plauded generously. The club was or
ganized early last term by a few of the

to which Commissioner Herold quickly
answered, "I will." This Incident created
jnuc-h merriment.
I luring an intermission, before bids
opened, ex-Prealdent Colnon crossed
to where Colonel Chadbourne was sit

Bee you, Mr. Chadbourne. I think I have

Chadbourne smilingly answered: "I feel
like a youngster who has been on a va

"There is only one mistake I made In
this business, " interrupted ex-Governor

''Why didn't you tlilnk of It sooner. Gov

those assembled in the room he said:

At the conclusion of Mr. Kliburn's re
marks Commissioners Harney and Her

officer.
Colonel Chadboume essayed to speak

had something to say:
"I have related with Mr. cv>i
non as a m< mb< r of this hoard for many
years," he said, "and during that period
ou? associations have always been agree
able. During the incumbency of Mr. Col

always found him attentive and pains
taking. During his incumbency a great
many improvements have taken olace on
the waterfront, particularly the erection
of this magnificent ferry depot, which
is a marvel of architecture. I wish Mr.

I will only be too glad to assist him in

1 have been with "ur ex-President for a
much shorter period than Major Harney,
n busy learning something and
I was therefore not quite as ready to
lend him the assistance 1 would lil
have been able to do. At the same time
our relations have always been pleasant
and I wish him the best of success in nis
future walk of life. I also desire to do
everything in my power in the way of
co-operating with my fellow members.
President Kilburnâ For these cordial

Colonel Chadbournt â Mr. Chairman, I

M.ij.ir Harney examined the document
and then passed it over to Commissioner

Mr. Buddâ The confirmation of the

While I do not question the right of thn

manner, 1 move that the credentials pre

AT NORTH BEACH PEOPLE PRAY
IT MAY NEVER RAIN AGAIN
Houses Are Flooded
and Boats Ply on
the Streets.
THE residents of that portion of
North Beach known as Harbor
View have quit praying for rain
and are now seriously considering
the proposition of building themselves
an ark, for the waters have risen upon
the land and apparently have given
up all thought of ever receding.
The natives amuse themselves during
the day by rowing around in boats,
collecting such articles of household
furniture as will float and securing
them upon the roof. At night they are
lulled to sleep by the gentle swish of
water under their beds and the croak
ing of frogs. Morning, noon and night
the contented "quack, quack" of ducks
may be heard in front yards, where,
flowers were wont to bloom, for the.
waters from the hills have gathered
themselves together and formed a lake
between Baker and I^yon streets from
Lombard street almost to the bay.
The residents in the vicinity say that â¦
the trouble is due to bad sewerage and 2o
the filling: in of Government land west â¦
of I, yon street, and the Fair estate Â»8
east of Baker strept, leaving the Z.
ground between Baker and I-iyon
streets in a hole. The heavy rains c<j
â¦
brought flown large quantities of
â water from the hills, for which there
was no outlet, and it naturally collect
ed on the low ground. little iittÂ«-ts
tinn was paid to it at first, but when
the downpour continued and the water
began to invade the houses people he
gan to think of moving out. In the
at Beach and I, yon streets Cor

The water rose to a height of
two feet in the room, and neighbors
finally brought in a boat and had him
transferred to the hospital. In a neigh
| onel Chadbourne's credentials the board
i adjourned until Tuesday next.
After the adjournment Secretary Eng
i lish courteously returned to Colonel Chad
' bourne the rejected commission.
It is understood that the attorneys of
Colonel Chadbourne will apply to the
ouirt for a writ to compel the board to
m at the applicant.
The bids which the hoard received for
repairing wharf were as fol

According to Their Records Smith

The names of the athletes who will take

ers are all in good condition and that it
is hoped a little blood caused by a glove
tap on the nose will not shock the sensi

fortunately are not engaged in fighting
insurgents near Manila. The sport will
begin at 8 o'clock sharp.

"Billy" Smith and George Green are In
training for their twenty round bout,
which will take place under the auspices
of the National Club in ward's Pa
vilion on the evening of April 7. Smith
should certainly be. a strong favorite, in
the betting, as, barring some unforeseen
accident, he cannot fail to whip Green,
who is apparently fast on the retrograde.
Two years ago Smith was defeated by
Green in Carson, but it is a well-known
fact that Smith was not in any condition
and that he did not try very, hard to
win. Last July he met Green again in
the Lenox Athletic Club, New York, and
defeated him in a twenty-five round bout.
Last December he met Walcott in the
same club and trimmed the dusky cham
pion in twenty rounds.
San Franciscans are only too well
aware of how Walcott handled Green in
this city on August 26, 1*97. It is not
necessary to go into details, as Walcott
made a lasting impression on the local
welter-weight. Possibly Green may have
improved in the last year or so, but his
improvement must have been very mark
ed, indeed, to place him on a par with the
aggressive and hard-hitting man known
as "the Mysterious" from no particular
place on earth. _ ' ,

due at the hands of honest and honorable
public officials.
Notwithstanding the fact that the reso
lution adopted at the last session of the
commission received the unanimous vote
of the members, it appears now that
each Commissioner has a different Idea
of the action taken at that time, and the
meeting fixed for April 10 will develop
some surprising features. Each member
of the commission will be found pulling
In a different direction instead of together
and for the railroad.
Chairman Edson believes he has a
I grievance in that he was induced to vote
j for the resolution agreeing to abandon all
I further litigation in reference to rate re
ductions, providing the commission was
allowed to put into effect an 8 per cent
reduction' on grain rates. He is In favor
of having the pending litigation with the
Southern Paciiic Company carried to a
conclusion on its merits.
Commissioner Laumeister believes that
the action of the Commissioners at their
I last meeting threw the responsibility of
' dismissing that litigation on the South
: crn Pacific Company, with all its at-
I tendant liabilities, but his views are ap
! parently not shared by â¢Commissioner
Blackstock, the father of the original
resolution. s â¢
In an interview at Los Angeles yester
day Judge Blackstock Indicated that in
! his opinion the action of the hoard bound
j the commission to. refrain from all further
; efforts at rate reduction and to abandon
I the defense of the suit brought against
the commission by the Southern Pacific
! Company.
With a view of getting light other than
i that shed by the Blackstock intelligence
on this important question Commissioner
! Edson has made application personally
to the attorneys who represented the
! Railroad Commission while the suit was
pending in the Federal Court. These gen
tlemen are ex-Attorney General Fitzger
ald, Robert Y. Hayne and W. \V. Foote.
It is understood that he asked these gen
tlemen the direct question whether they
were in favor of dismissing the pending
litigation, that he received a negative re
ply and that he has asked these gentle
men to appear before the commission on
April 10, when decisive action is expected
to be taken by the commission relative
to this litigation. His idea Is to have the
new Board of Railroad Commissioners
fully Informed on the question by those
twn feet deep on the floor.
As yet there have been no accidents
of a serious nature, but there have
boon some narrow escapes. Two little
boys were amusing themselves by float
ing around on a plank. The" plank
overturned and both of them were
thrown into about six feet of water.
Their cries attracted attention, and
two men put out in a boat and rescued

who have made it a close legal Btudy for
B< veral yours and who are thoroughly fa
miliar with all the ramifications of the
subject.
Chairman Edson is inclined to the opin
ion already expressed by ex-Attorney
General Fitzgerald that the litigation
should be pressed to a conclusion on its
merits, so as to have the powers of the
commission settled for all time to come.
He has arrived at the conclusion that the
only two reasons assigned by Commission
er Rlackstock for the abandonment of the
fight iv behalf of the shippers are without
weight. These are that continued litiga
tion will be a source of great expense to
the people, and that the s per cent reduc
tion on grain rates has virtually been ob
tained by means of the competition of the
Valley road, iie realizes now that the
stem ing of any particular rate reduct
tions is a mere incident in this moment
ous suit, and that the money it may cost,
even though it he $100,000, would be a mere
bagatelle compared to the advantages
that may accrue from carrying the suit
to a conclusion. He perceives now that
the real issues are far more important
and far reaching; that it is absolutely
necessary for the commission to ascertain
the financial position of the Southern I'a
ciflc Company in every detail in order to
see if the commission has the legal right
to make reductions, and that a very im
portani issue, also raised in the pending
litigation, is to have decided the vallditj
of the leases between the Southern Pa
eitic Company and its lesser lines. Chair
man Edson believes that the money ex
pended by the fnrmw commission and
the efforts of his predecessors should not
be thrown away because of a mistaken
idea of eeeonomy, because of any false
issue raised of"oecause it is the wish of
the Southern Pacific Company. lie de
clares that he does not wear a railroad
collar, and. what is more, that he does '
not propose to suffer in silence under the
suspicion that he is controlled by that
corporation.
NO INCREASE IN RATES.

LOS ANGELES. March IXâ The present
Board, of Railroad Commissioners will not
consent to an Increase of passenger rates

Judge N. Blackstock. who is Railroad
Commissioner for this district, is in this

SPECIAL AGENT TO
HAWAII IN THIS CITY
HAROLD M. SEWALL ON HIS
WAY TO WASHINGTON.
Says He Is Not Going to Press His
Claims for Appointment as Gov
ernor of the Islands.
Hon. Harold M. Sewall, who has heen
the special agent of the United States in
Hawaii ever since the latter's annoxa
tloa, was one of the passengers on the
steamer Australia which arrived yester
day. Ah soon as he came ashore Mr.
Sewall was driven hastily away in a car
riage, and this gave rise to the rumor
that he intended to leave for Washington
on the evening train. It was further
stated that he was going there to lay his
claims before President BCcKlnley for the
appointment as Governor of Hawaii. It
was subsequently learned that Mr. Sewall
went immediately to the home of his
mother-in-law, Mrs. Caroline A?he, at
2315 Sacramento street. When seen last
night he was the central figure in the
family circle and laughed heartily when
told of the rumors that had gained cur
rency owing to his hurried departure
from the vessel.
"The object of my visit here," he paid,
"is simply to visit my family whom 1 have
not seen for some time. I have oDtalned
a leave of absence for thirty days, and
will remain in this city for a week or so
and then go to my home in Maine, where
I expect to stay for ten days or more.
1 will then go to Washington, where I
will submit my report on the conditions
now prevailing- in Hawaii. Whether the
administration will formulate a plan of
government on my report or not I am un
able to say.
"I was originally In Hawaii as United
Stairs Minister, hut as we are now under
onft lla,g my diplomatic functions < â â¢
and I became simply a representative of
the United States* in the endeavor to con
tinue our relations with the Hawaiian
Government. I will make a report on a

return to the islands in May.
"As to my mission to Washington being
in the interest of my candidacy for the
Governorship of Hawaii. I must say that
this Is the first time I have heard of if.
I will say, however, for the edification of
the one who started the rumor. that it is
possible I may not go to Washington at
all, preferring to send my written reports
to the department. It would be ill
advised on my part to discuss the ques
tion, since it is a matter largely to be de
termined by President McKln'ley. That

another surprise to me, as I really did not
know that either of. us was after it."
Mr. Sewall is a son of Arthur Sewall,
who was defeated fnr Vice President on
the Bryan ticket at the last election. Al
though he would not discuss his chances
for the Governorship of Hawaii, it is gen
erally believed that he stands well with
the administration. His great knowledge
of Island affairs will he. largely instru
mental in gaining for him the coveted
position, and added to this he is an en
thusiast on the subject of annexation and
his appointment is regarded as almost a
certainty.
