LAWTON'S
ENCOUNTER
WITH TAGALS
The Insurgents Fight From
Heavy Earthworks at
San Ildefonzo.
MAJOR DIGGLES SHOT
Every Mile of the Forward Move

Battle Is Soon Expeoted.

MftJNILA. May 9 (by carrier
pigeon from Balinag).â The
strongest insurgent position yet
known in the course of General Law
ton's advance was developed to-day
at San Ildefonzo, nine miles north of
Balinag. by a reconnoitering party
consisting of two companies of the
Thirteenth Minnesota and Second
Oregon regiments. Heavy earth
works extended for a mile from a
gwamp on the left along a high ridge
in front of the town, and on the right
were flanking trenches commanding
a vast open country given up to rice
fields.
The enemy, on the approach of our
small force, opened a terrible fusil
lade, and the troops withdrew. Major
Diggles of the Minnesota Regiment
was shot through the head.
If the enemy holds this position a
great battle may be expected soon.
All indications suggest that every
mile of the forward movement of
General Lawton toward San Isidro
will be resisted.
Thousar 5" of hungry Filipinos are
swarming into Lawton's lines. They
are being fed from the large insur
gents' stores of rice captured at
Balinag.
General Lawton has established
the first native municipal govern
ment in the Philippines at Balinag.
A Filipino major, who is authorized
to select a council, was elected yester
day at a public meeting of natives.
The Don Jose, the last of the miss
ing steamers under the American flag
which were detained by the insur
gents since the beginning of the war,
was found by the gunboat Manila at
Batabangas and arrived here to-day.

CRUISER RALEIGH
WENT ON THE BAR
But at High Tide Tugs Extricated
the Vessel and No Damage
Was Done.
CHARLESTON, S. C, May 9.â The
cruiser Raleigh, which wont on the bar
while entering the port early to-day, was
pulled off by two tugs at high tide this
evening. The Raleigh proceeded up the
harbor to her anchorage. It was stated
by her officers that a superficial examina
tion disclosed no injuries to her hull.
The Raleigh was coming in with a coast
pilot, and the point at which she grounded
is known as North Breakers, just outside
of the jetty. She went on the shoal broad
side and lay easy in perfectly calm water.
The accident necessitated a postponement
of the official reception to the cruiser, and
this will be carried out to-morrow morn
ing.

RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS HOLD SEVERAL SECRET
CONFERENCES AT THE HOME OF W. F. HERRIN
Charles S. Laumeister and N. Black
stock Shamelessly Invite Pub=
lie Condemnation.
Railroad Commands Given
in Secret and Obeyed
in Public.
Railroad Convtnissioners C. S. Lau
meister and N. Blackstock have com
pletely discarded any mask of pre
tended independence or honesty of
purpose in their duties as public of
ficials and have submitted themuelves
to criticism and condemnation as the
creatures of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. They have again instructed
the Attorney General of the State to
demand of the Federal Court the dis
missal of the "grain rate cases."
This demand, made in the face of the
scorching rebuke of Judge Morrow,
would be astounding if the explana
tion and the reason for it were not
more startling.
Commissioners Blackstock and
Laumeister have so dishonored the
positions they occupy as to place
themselves openly and abjeclly at the
dictation of William F. Herrm. These
men have dined at the home of Wil
liam F. Herrin. They have feasted
and wined in the hospitality of his
home. They have held secret confer
ences at the residence of the chief of
the law department of the Southern
Pacific Company.
Affairs of public business have
been discussed where there had been
no open sesame before election to
Blackstock and Laumeister. Sessions
of pleasure and of business have been
held at a house where public officers,
holding- such relationships as BJack
stock and Laumeister, could not be
seen without falling within the
shadow of honest suspicion. At the
invitation, which was in substance a
command, these disgraced officials
have gone to Herrin's home to re
ceive the instructions and formulate
the wishes of the Southern Pacific
Company. There has seldom been in
the history of dishonest public life
so disgraceful an expose as this.
Blackstock and Laumeister have
almost invited upon themselves the
shame of their actions, for they have
always visited Herrln's home to
gether, which means as public offi
cials. The social equality which Her
rin extended to Blackstock and Lau
meister was given only to Railroad
Commissioners, and the discredited
officers admitted it yesterday when
they passed all bounds of decency and
repeated a demand which Attorney
General Ford and Judge Morrow can
only construe as an insult to men
who have forgotten thii meaning of
the word.
Even to a shrewd observer it is not
clear why the Southern Pacific Com
pany seemingly with wantonness ex
poses its creatures to public shame.
To those that know the reason is
plain. If the Southern Pacific Com
pany can induce the State to dismiss
the suit, the great corporation will
save an enormous sum in costs and in
the exaction of penalties, which
would have to be paid in the event
of defeat before Judge Morrow. That
is why Blackstock and Laumeister
must apply the brand to themselves.
Their masters are desperate.
R ABROAD COMMISSIONERS
BLACKSTOCK AND LAU
MEISTER did not attend- the
recent banquet given to Collis
P. Huntington at the Palace Hotel.
Their absence v/as observed and
provoked no little comment at the time.
Many people wondered why those faith
ful and zealous allies of the corpora
tion were not conspicuous at the feast.
In a sense the mystery has been solved.
The railroad classification places the
Commissioners in a special class. The
hospitality, intellectual or otherwise,
which W. F. Herrin bestows is be
st ow.'d for the edification of the Com-
missinnens at his own residence in this
city.
It may surprise the voters of Califor
nia who elected Rlackstoek and Lau
meister to represent the people to learn
that these two Commissioners dine at
Herrin's house, drink the wine that
Herrin loves best and smoke the cigars
which the chief of the railroad's law
department so highly commends. If th<Â»
functions were limited to the discussion
of edibles, wine and tobacco comment
might bo withheld, but The ("all ascer
tains from good authority that freight
schedules prepared by the masterly ge
nius ot Vice President Stubbs are also
discussed.
These little gatherings of Herrin"s
house, like the banquet to Mr. Hunting
ton at the Palace Hotel, are understood
at the yellow building to be purely so
rial functions, which the newspapers
ought not to mention. The first one
took place early in April and was at
tended by E. B. Edson, C. S. Laumeis
ter and Nehemiah 31ackstock. The
president of the board, so far as can
be ascertained, has not attended since
SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, 31 AY 10, 1899.
the first session. Whether he is no
longer on the invitation list or elects to
enjoy himself elsewhere is purely a
matter of conjecture. There is a cur
rent notion in the yellow building: that
the freight schedule presented by
Btubba was too raw for the Edson di
gestive apparatus. Nothing, however,
is too raw for Laumeister and Klaek
stock bids fair to be ablf to digest any
thing bofore the schedule season elosrs.
The Commissioner from Ventura and
his coworker representing this district
are frequent guests at the Herrin resi
dence. The Call is informed that they
have held seven or eight sessions there.
It is true that Mr. Blaekstoek, before
he left his home in Ventura to accept
the hospitality of Herrin, had ideas of
his own concerning injunctions, sched
ules nf freight, grain rates and "dif
ferentials." He was so enamored of his
own views that he printed them at his
<nvn expense and communicated them
to his associates on the board. Under
the Influence or inspiration of Herrin
hospitality his early notions of dealing
with the railroad suits have been dis
pelled. The record of his early opinion,
however, is not destroyed.
It may be said, perhaps to Mr. Black-
Btock's credit, That he is a seeker fnr
knowledge. He was not quite enn-

| Hospitality.
vincetf that the views of Herrin and
Stubbs concerning freight rates were
correct, so he applied to Mr. Hunting
ton for additional light on the subject.
Evidently The president of the company
regarded Blackstock's approach as an
intrusive visit, Bueh as could not be
tolerate^ from a subordinate. In effect
the president replied: "I don't give a
whether you adopt any schedule.
No one shall fix freight rates for my
road." If the purpose of the visit was
to establish agreeable social relations

rnissioner must have been disappointed
if not discouraged. After this bluff
Blackatock returned to the Herrin so
cials with added zest. When Edson
and Laumeister heard of the Hunting
ton episode they smiled.
The house where Mr. Herrin enter
tains the Railroad Commissioners is
not ostentatious. It is a really com
fortable dwelling on Broadway, which
was visited during 1 the session of the
Legislature by a few confidential ad
visers of D. M. Burns. It is not showy
or largo, but there is ample room for
the host and the Railroad Commission
ers. In the wineroom there is always
"one bottle more" when the schedule
is under discussion. The house would

, not hr> the subject of special mention if
Mr. Herrin had nr.t elected to have the
Railroad Commissioners transact public
â  business there. In order to be fair anÂ«J
just, having invited the Commissioners
to hold sessions at his house, he should
Invite the people to listen to the dis
cussion.
The law provides a meeting place and
a secretary for the ecrmmissinn. An
allowance of public money is made to
pay office rent and employ clerical as
sistance. The propriety of the com
i mission meeting In Mr. Huntington's
office or Mr. Herrin's house may be
questioned by citizens who are nrrt on
the Southern Pacific pay roll or in line
to get there, but Mr. Eidson appears to
be the only member of the board who
comprehends the impropriety of hold
ing secret sessions in Herrin's home to
discuss freight tariffs for the peqple
prepared by Mr. Stubbs.
Commissioner Laumeister is a new
convert to the policy of dismissing the
suit. When the proposition was pre
sented he said: "If I should vote to
dismiss the suit I would be ashamed
to live in California." The precise time
and place of Mr. Ijaumeister's conver
sion cannot be ascertained, but the evi
dence of circumstances establishes the

AN INSULTING DEMAND.
Blackstock and Laumelster
Again instruct the At
torney General.
C. P. Huntington's precious twain on
the Railroad Commission, Messrs. Lau
metster and Blackstock, have derided to
persist in their bald attempt to have
the "Krai!) rate cases"' dismissed by the
eral court. Ignoring utterly the
Stern rebuke administered to them on
Monttay by Judge Morrtjw, in faoe of
the trend of public <>j>ini<>n whir.i has
set so strongly against them, they yes
terday adopted a sc'eond resolution di
recting Attorney General Ford to again
fare the displeasure of the rourt and
reiterate his demand for a dismissal of
the cases.
As in the first case, the resolution
adopted yesterday was promulgated
and offered for action by the faithful
Mr. Blackstoek. It differed from his
original remarkable resolution only in
that it did not carry the reflections
upon the court to which Judge Mor
row took such strong exception nor
contain that palpable falsehood to the
effect that while the cases were pending
the present commission was prevented
from issuing a new grain rate schedule.
Yesterday's resolution was nothing;
more than a flat order to th^ Attorney
General to bring about a dismissal, no
matter what the means, and to do so in
as short order as his wits or his Influ
ence might devise. The resolution was,
in fact, as follows:
WHEREAS, On the 9th day
of May, 1899, the Railroad
Commissioners of the State of
California passed and adopted
a resolution amending the res
olution by said board passed
and adopted April 24, 1899,
repealing and rescinding the
resolutions adopted by said
board on the 13th and 14th
days of September, 1895, pro
viding for a reduction of grain
rates, etc.; and
WHEREAS, The hoard is
of the opinion that the case
now pending in the Circuit
Court of the United States
known as the "grain-rate"
case should be settled and the
injunction against the board
be dissolved, but that the
same shall be done without
further cost to the State,
Again a Dismissal
of Grain Rate
Cases Asked.
IT IS NOW THEREFORE
ordered and resolved that the
Attorney General of the State
of California be and he hereby
is instructed to secure a dis
missal of said case as soon as
such dismissal can be obtained
and upon the conditions as to
cost as herein indicated.
There was nothing of excitement or
striking feature to the meeting; the
whole proceeding did not require over
ten minutes' time, and everything was
as cut and dried as a well-contrived
slate at a county convention. It was,
however, not a happy occasion for any
one of them who participated, saving,
of course, Commissioner Edson. who
had a laush coming at the discomfiture
of the majority, and made good use of
it. Commissioner Blackstock was as
mad as a bear with a sore paw, and
though he spent his spare time in mak
ing light of Judge Morrow's censure,
he demonstrated that it had struck well
home by his ill-disguised displeasure at
the newspaper representatives in the
room and his reiterated statement that
he had been too long in the law busi
ness not to know better than to ridicule
a Federal Justice.
Laumeister was not happy at all. The
pace set to the cracking of Mr. Hunt
ingion's whip is evidently getting just
a bit too warm for him. and he did not
second Rlackstock's maneuvers as
warmly as might be expected of one
of the Espee'a chosen ones. On the
contrary Mr. Laumeister considered
Mr. Blackstock with an eye of sus
picion, and was prone to agree at times
with Mr. Edson when he took his stand
against the well-planned scheme of
which Blackstock was the pilot.
"In view of the attitude of the court,"
said Mr. Blackstock, "and Mr. Ford's
letter, I move to rescind the original
resolution rescinding the so-called I^a
Rue resolution, and I submit this reso
lution to that effect." Then Mr. Black
stock moved its adoption and Mr. Lau
meister seconded. Only Mr. Edson
voted against It.
Then Mr. Blackstock offered the reso
lution to dismiss. He made no speech
in its behalf; it was evident that none
was necessary. Mr. Laumeister im
mediately seconded, and. with Commis
sioner Edson again voting no. it was
adopted. Not, however, without objec
tion from Mr. Edson.
"I object to the passage of such a
resolution," said he. "The court has al
ready told us that it is not within our
province to ask for this dismissal. The
railroad, and not the State, is the plain
tiff in these cases, and Justice Morrow
said yesterday it was the plaintiff's
business to ask for dismissal. I think
the course that is being taken by this
board is without parallel in the history
of the State."
Mr. Edson stuck to his side of the
question as a matter of principle. The
fact that the Southern Pacific had got
all it ever expected to get out of the
grain-rate cases, delay, did not count
with him, and, as he said after the
meeting, he could not see the use of
permitting the Southern Pacific to un
load upon the State thousands of dol
lars in costs its suits had entailed.
Mr. Edson's little talk was well re
ceived, however. Mr. Blackstock lis
tened interestedly and voted aye. Mr.
Laumeister listened and voted like
wise. Mr. Edson voted no, and the
resolution was declared adopted. It
did not take a minute, and then, to
stall further talk, both Laumeister and
Blackstock began to talk of adjourn
ment, as there was danger that the
question of the "Stockton differential"
would be brought up, and that is an
other thing Mr. Huntington wants more
delay on. Things are going his way
very nicely under the present prohibi
tive tariff, and his friends the ware
housemen at Port Costa are well satis
fled with rates as they are.
Edson, though, brought it up before a
motion was made, and gave Blackstock
another opportunity to show his hand.
Mr. Edson thought some action should
be taken at once. He said the Stock
ton people had been waiting for four
months for something decisive and
nothing had been done. "I don't be
lieve we should do anything with it un
til this rate case business is fixed." re
torted Blackstock, "and when it comes
to further consideration of it you can
count me out. I've got cases in court
and can't attend special meetings. "
Mr. Edson looked surprised and so
did Mr. Laumeister. The Rlackstork
gait was a little too strong for him
there. It was so palpably what Mr.
! Stubbs had asked for on the day be
fore that he couldn't rally enough nerve
to stand for it. _"We ought to do some
thing at once." said he, "or at our next
regular meeting, anyway. In fact, I
think we should call a special meeting."
j Edson agreed to this and adjournment
I was taken to the next regular meeting
j on June 12.

Therefore the Society Does Not Like

Special Dispatch to The Call.
The New York members of the
Society of Sons of the Revolution
are not inclined to follow General
Merritt in his fulsome praise of
Alger as "the best Secretary of
War the world has ever seen," and
are less so because General Miles
is a member of their order, and
they do not believe he should have
been slapped in public at the na
tional convention in Detroit
The result is likely to be a very
pretty little tempest in the order.
NEW YORK, May 9.â There is likely
to be a lively discussion at the meeting
of the Empire State Society of the Sons
of the American Revolution on the 23d
inst. of the acts of the society's dele
gates in Detroit last week, which have
been heralded as an indorsement of
Secretary Alger, or affirmation of the
indorsement of the Secretary by Gen
erals Merritt, Wheeler and King. The
constitution, rules and practices of the
organization require members as such
to eschew politics, as the membership
includes Republicans and Democrats
and men of other political proclivities.
These general reasons, it is held by a
contingent of the New York society,
should have restrained delegates to the
national convention at Detroit from do
ing anything or appearing in any light
which might be taken as giving support
to one side of a controversy essentially
political. But besides these general rea
sons there are specific and delicate
ones, which, it is urged, should have
kept the New York delegates from ap
plauding the generous praise accorded
Secretary Alger by Generals Merritt,
Wheeler and Horatio King. General
Miles is a member of the Empire State
Society and the conspicuous tribute to
General Alger by the New York dele
gates is indirectly a slap by them at a
fellow member.
The dissatisfaction crystallized in
these resolutions presented in the meet
ing of the board of governors of the
New York society:
The Empire State Society of the Sons
of the American Revolution repudiates in
the strongest manner the use of its na
tional meeting for political purposes. Es
pecially does it condemn any attempt to
| vindicate reputations of public officials or
| to compliment those who have been ac
; cused of unpatriotic neglect of soldiers
| who exposed their lives for the country.
I The first duty of all patriotic societies is
to assist, protect and uphold the armies
of the nation and to aid in giving them
the support that the resources of the
country command. This society claims
its part In such patriotic duty and repudi
ates with indignation the flippant senti
ment that "supposing they had a little
spoiled beef, what of it? " Or that in
supplying them with food it was not
necessary to be particular as to quality.
! This society looks with horror upon offl
| cials who can express such sentiments,
or who, having the entire resource - o\
this wealthy country at command, not
i only furnished soldiers "a little spoiled
' : beet," hut Rrtvf them little else, even in
i home camps, where good food in abun
i dance was everywhere at hand, and who
: also failed to supply them with suitable
clothing, shelter and medicine.
Resolved, That copies of these resolu
tions be sent to all affiliated societies.
LONE STAR SUSPENDS NEW
YORK-GALVESTON SERVICE
Removal of Steamers to the Pacific
Coast Terminates a Noted
Freight War.
NEW YORK, May o.â lt was said at the
office of the Lone Star Line to-day that
the line had temporarily suspended its
New York-Galveston service. The Miami,
which leaves port next Saturday, will be
the last vessel to leave this port. No ari
titional Information could be given and
the agent refused to discuss the suspen
sion except to say that a statement would
be given to the public in a few days.
A local paper says: The Lone Star
steamships now in the New York-Galves
ton trade, it is understood, have been sold
and will be used between San Francisco
and the Hawaiian Islands. This ends one
of the most foremost transporting strug
gles of this decade. The advent of the
I oro Star Line into the coastwise com
merce b! ought on a war which knocked
lates from 80 cents lo 2 cents per 100
pounds between New York and Galveston
and which upset the rate situation of the
whole Southwest. The Spanish-American
war caused a truce, and when that con
flict cuded the Lone Star. Mallory and
Morgan lines worked in harmony for a
time but lately there has been a great
deal of rate cutting and slashing.

VAST STEEL AND
IRON COMBINATION
Trust With a Capital
$800,000,000.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, May 9.â The Tribune will
pay to-morrow: Representatives of two
of the big corporations which rumor
has associated with the proposed $800,
--000,000 combination of iron and steel In
dustries declared to-day that material
pr.'Sress had been made during the
day. The plan, already exploited to a
considerable degree, i^ to absorb mines,
mills, railroads and factories. The two
representatives in question said the
following corporations, giving the capi
tal BtOCk Of each, were to be included:
The Carnegie Company, $250,000,000;
Federal Steel Company. $100,000,000;
: ican Steei and Wire Company,
9,800; National Steel Company,
159,000,000; Republic Steel Company,
$50,000,000; American Steel Hoop Com
pany, $33,000,000.
The figures given of the Carnegie
Company are less than the accepted
t-stimatod amount invested. It is said
that if the groat trust is formed the
Carnegie concern will represent rrn less
th;in $300,000,000 of its capital. The Fed
eral Steel Company has an authorized
capital of 1200,000,000, but only one-half
of it will be taken, it is said.
One thine: it is proposed the trust
shall do, the representatives stated, Is
to take in the iron and steel plants of
importance which arc still independent
concerns. None of these is large when
mnipared with the trusts, but they are
considerable industries. The largest of
thorn are: Jones & Laughlin Company.
PittÃburg capital $10,000,000; Cambria
Steel Company, capital $5,000,000; Scran.
ton Bteel company, capital $5,000,000.

Two Escape and a Third Gets a
Severe Beating.
LEBANON. Term, May 0.-A mob of
fifty masked men terrorized this place at
an early hour this morning. First the jail
was visited, and Ewing Hodge, who is
charged with attempting to murder a
white woman, was demanded. Being as
eured by a search of the jail that Hodge
had been spirited away to safety, the
mob turned its attention to the city
workhouse. There Bill Dibble and Leslie
Huggins, two negroes accused of attempt
ing to force themselves into Mrs. Mace's
house, were confined, and they were soon
in the mob's hands. Officers attempted
to interfere, and in the mix up Huggins
escaped. Then Dibble was hustled into
a spring wagon and started to the coun
try. Nothing further is definitely known,
but it is said the negro escaped with a
severe beating.

STANDARD OIL
WINS A POINT
Contempt Proceedings
Are Dismissed.
JENNINGS NEED NOT ANSWER
NEWSPAPER BUREAU UPHELD
BY THE COURT.
However, the Main Case in the Prose
cution of the Trust and Many In
teresting Questions Are
Yet to Be Heard.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 9.â The
Standard Oil Company won a point in
ttv Supreme Court to-day, when a de
cision was handed down dismissing the
tempt proceedings against Malcolm
Jennings, a newspaper man. Jennings
v ,i.- subpenaed as a witness in
the Standard Oil suits by the Attorney
General, who endeavored to show that
the witness was conducting a news bu
reau In the Interests of the Standard
Oil Company. When asked to give a
list of papers to which he furnished
matter, Jennings refused and was cited
tui contempt. The Supreme^ Court held
that the information asked of the wti
ness was not important, and that it
would not tend to throw any light on
ih" question at issue. The court held,
th( refore, that the witness was not in
mpt in refusing to answer the
question.
Attorney General Monnett called the
attention of the court to the old con
tempt case, growing out of the Stand
ard >M 1 prosecution, and asked that it
be set for hearing at as early a date
as possible. He said that he would sub
mit a brief in a day or two and that
ilv printed records in the case could
b< furnished later.
Virgil P. Kline, attorney for the
Standard Oil Company, said that the
i ompany had stood charged in the pub
lic prints with having attempted to se
cure results by bribery, ajid he did not
think the main question should be
heard and disposed of until after these
other cases had been passed upon as to
their truth or falsity and thoroughly in
vestigated. The company had volunta
rily appeared after the Attorney Gen
eral had furnished his Information in
the alleged attempted bribery case, in
order not to interfere or retard in the
slightest degree the ascertaining of the
exact truth of the allegations, and un
der these circumstances he did not be
lieve that the main case should be con-
Bidered or passed on until after the
charges made against the company had
been disposed of.
The company did not desire to lay
under such" charges. Under these cir
cumstances it was his judgment that it
would be proper for the court to ap-
I noint a commissioner to take depositions
! in the case. He had asked that the case
I be set for hearing on the 18th inst., but
the Attorney General had not complied
with the request contained therein. He
J urged that the main question could not
be discussed.
The court reserved decision or the
question raised.

MRS. OELRICHS PUTTING
UP A "SPITE FENCE."
NEW YORK, May P.â A Journal special
from Newport says: Mrs. Herman Oel
richs is in a heap of trouble because she
cannot purchase a piece of property ad
joining her estate on the cliffs. The Oel
richs estate, upon which is now being
i rected a new villa to replace the old
wooden Rose Cliff, extends from the
fa.nu>us cliffs up to the estate of George
F. Parkman of Boston, which is on Belle
vue avenue, between the homes of Perry
Belmont and Harry Payne Whitney.
In order to reach the Oelrlchs place It
is necessary to drive down a narrow
lane. Mrs. Oelrichs did not like this, and
wished to have a frontage on Bellevue
avenue. She tried her best to buy
from Mr. Parkman, offering, it is
said, as high as $50,000 for his land, but
that gentleman refused to sell. Mrs. Oel
rlchs. to vent her feelings toward the
Bostonian, is having erected "a spite
fence" twenty feet high to run between
the two estates, whirh will prevent the
Parkmans from having a sea view, and
what is worse than all is that the fence
Is not to be painted, but Is to be an un
sightly rough board fence.

I nison and Booth, representing the Cali
| fornia Safe Deposit and Trust Company,
appeared in the Superior Court before
Judge Angellotti to-day to foreclose the
mortgage held by that company on the
! property of the Pacific sTacht Club at
Sausalito. There were i"' 1 bonds Issued,
the par value of each being $100. and the
trust company officiated as trustee. The
foreclosure of the mortgage is to secure
these bonds, as they have become due
through non-payment of interest. Action

LATIN PLAY^ PRESENTED.
Innovation in the Entertainment Line
at Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May !>.â
The chapel was crowded this evening
I when Professor Falrclougfi, with the aid
of several of his Latin students, pri
jed a Latin piny. The synopsis of the play
was piven in English by Mr. Jetmore, and
the audience, although as a whole not
able to follow closely the Latin, thor
oughly appreciated the acting. The stage
j was arranged as nearly like an old Roman
, stage as possible, and the actors wore the
headgear and dress of the Romans. At
I the drop of the curtain the encores were
i loud and repeated. Tins comedy, "Trlnum
! mils," was gtvt n several weeks ago by
i Professor Falrclmi^h to a f.-w friends and
to-night marked the lirsi attempt of any
Western college t>> produce a. play in
I Latin.
The fourth act only was staged, as the
' play Is a long one. It is by Plautus in the
I third century before Christ and signifies
"The Three Pieces of Money." At the
opening Mrs. Pease sang, to the accom

CHEMICALS TO
PRESERVE FOODS
Adulterations Used in
Illinois Freely.
PROF. MITCHELL'S EXPOSURE
STARTLING EVIDENCE GIVEN
A SENATORIAL COMMITTEE.
Butchers and Farmers Employ Anti
septics That Must Act Most
Disastrously on the Tis
sue oi the Stomach.
s : â¢ . la] i Us] atch to The Call.
â  CHICAGO, May 9.â Freezinp, pre
servatir.e. "freeze 'em." rosaline and
laktone are things few people know i>t",
but that they take those adulterations
into their stomachs was stated by Pro
fessor A. S. Mitchell, analytical chem
ist of the Wisconsin Cairy and F 1
Commission to the Senatorial commit
tee on pure food investigation to-day.
Professor Mitchell gave the commit
tee some important information. As
a result Senator Mason has had several
manufacturers subpenaed and they
will be called on to-mormw probably to
tell the commission something about
these compounds.
"The use of antiseptics as preserva
tives," said Profess>v Mitchell, "has
become alarmingly great. They are
used as colorings and to stop the de
velopment (if germs in dairy products;
also in shipped meats, bulk oysters,
fish, hams and possibly corned beef."
Professor Mitchell made the sworn
statement that nearly every butcher in
Illinois u^ed preserving fluids on scraps
of meat which th^y laid aside for the
manufacture of hamburger steaks.
The chemist first told <>f a liquid
known as "freessine." Professor Mil
chell said that the stuff had been used
extensively by fanners to keep milk
and butter, it being the custom to mix
it with the former in small quantities
and pour it into vats for the preserva
tion of butter.
â¢This freezine' I have found to be
nothing less than almost pure formic
aldehyde," narrated the expert. "This
is a chemical that acts disastrously on
the tissue of tlie stomach, and I can
only surmise the results when milk
diluted with it is used constantly by a
family. Where butter is placed in vats
ailed with this stuff the porous com
modity takes up no small part of the
liquid, with a result that can only be
conjectured."
The professor proceeded to tell of his
experiments with a fluid sold extensive
ly m butchers for the purpose of mak
ing their hamburger steaks last and
j keep up a healthy appearance.
â This liquid contains in great percent
what is known as sulphide of soda, with
a complement of coloring matter." he
continued. "It is styled an antiseptic
and in certain respects is. This must
be borne in mind, however, that where
fermentation and waste are arrested
the digestive properties are consequent
ly destroyed."
Dr. Wiley, the Government expert
who examined the antiseptic wftbtrat
going on the stand, said he identified it
| as practically the same chemical which
â  was used during his experience at mcd
i ical colleges to preserve cadavers and
was now occasionally put to service in
: disinfecting houses where smallpox pa
i tients resided.

Rupture is Curable
Startling Assertion by a Well-
Known New Yorker.
Cites the Case of Wm. A. Berry as
Absolute Evidence..
Dr. W. B. Rice of 118 H. Main street, Adams,
N. v.. Bays that any kind of rupture can be
cured at the patient's home without the slight-
est pain, danger, operation or detention from
daily work. He gives the names and addresses
â¢\ y â â â â¢:â¢/.;.;.?>â¢â¢â '
MR. WM. A. BERRY, Bristol, N. H.
i of several hundred prominent people whom he
I has cured, one of which, William A. Berry of
Bristol, N. H., will serve to show the work-
ings of this wonderful plan. Dr. Rice has de-
vised a new system that holds any rupture, no
matter how large it is, and at the same time
' causes the ruptural opening to grow together
I and become solid flesh- and muscle. He ix-
i plains the system fully in a book which Be
mails free to all who write. Mr. Berry Is a
business man and well known manufacturer of
Bristol and had a difficult rupture tor which
' he had tried electricity, sprins and other kinds
of trusses, belts and various treatments with-
out benefit.
He had been told by all who fitted trusses
I that he could not be cured, and that a surgical
' operation, while not a certainty but extremely
' dangerous, was the nearest approach to a cure.
lAs Mr. Berry had already paid out over a nun- *
! dred dollars for treatment without the slightest T
benefit, he was somewhat discouraged against
trying the new Rice method, but finally sum-
j moned sufficient courage to make one more
! effort. Mr. Berry says of the cure: "It is com-
j plete; the severed muscles are securely healed.
It is eighteen months since I stopped treatment
â  and not a sign of rupture have I had since, not-
i withstanding the fact that I have done all kinds
iof work with Impunity." This experience wiil
! undoubtedly interest every one who is ruptured.
! and readers should write to Dr. Rice for his
j free book. Write to-day and investigate this
method that assures a complete and permanent
i cure of any kind of rupture.

Practical Hints to Those Who
Suffer From Weak
Nerves.
A SERIOUS CONDITION THAT TOO
OFTEN PRO YES. FATAL
Statistics prove that about 7.". per cent of
the adult population" suffer from nervous dls-
i +ufw, more or less severe. Why: this Is so Is
/sV.-*adlly understood when we take into con-
r. deration that a great many causes result in
a breaking down of the nerves.
The prevalent of nervous diseases led scien-
tific lnvesticators Into this field of work, In
order to discover a means to overcome these
baneful affections. The result was the discov-
ery of the Great Hudyan; the one remedy that
has proved wonderfully successful In the treat-
ment of all nervous diseases.
HUDYAN |a n<-.\v within the reach of every
on<Â» who m-f-ds it. People formerly paid lan?e
h-ums to obtain it. In every Instance their
rnon*-y was well spent, fnr Hudyan invariably
cures diseased of the nervous system. Medical
chemistry having aided us this valuable rem-
edy ha.i been concentrated and deduced so that
it is now within the reach of every man or
woman. Its curative properties are Just the
game .<* when people had to pay |ISQ for it.
HUDYAN Is for men and women who are
â weak. pale, nervous and who suffer with head-
aches, sleeplessness-, impaired digestion dizzU
ness, costlveness and the many other symptoms
that denote a weakened condition of the nerves
Women who sutler the many reflex nervous
disturbances due to disorders peculiar to their
sÂ»x will find that Hudyan will relieve' and
cure them.
Men who are weak and nervous and not able
to apply themselves to any task will find in
Hudyan a positive it-*.
Hudyan is for sale by druKjrists, or it will

American Catholic Church Is
Violently Attacked by
Canon Delassus.
Sr^ial rM?pat<-h to ThÂ» Call.
NEW YORK, May P.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Catholic
j church authorities of this city have re
f received a book written by
Canon Delassus of the cathedral in
brai, France, entitled "The Con
spiracy Against Christianity." in whicb
; a violent attack is made on the Ameri
can Catholic church. The writer, who
\ is well known in literary circles as the
editor of tho Semaine' Religieuse, an
influential -Catholic publication, states
that Dreyfus has received his moral
j support from the United States.
The American church by itself has
appointed a mission to teach all nations
.â¢>us toleration, which is in reality
only religious license, Pere Delassus
says, and has found many imitators in
Franco. From this unhappy in'luence
such evils as the Jewish conspiracy to
obtain domination over the Christian
world have gained abnormal strength.
Archbishop Ireland, Dr. Zahm, the
Catholic scientists of Xotre Dame and
the Taulist order are termed a reproach
of the modern Catholic church.
Our attitude toward Spain is made j
the subject of another scathing criti
cism. This bunk bears the imprima
tur of the Archbishop of ('ambrai,
and in the preface it is stated that the
articles contained in the volume ap
peared originally in the Semaine Re
ligieuse, and that they now appear in
book form by special request of the
Metropolitan of Cambrai.
Th<- Washington churchmen are
quite indignant over this latest display
of hostility on the part of certain
of the French clergy. Many copies of
thr* book, together with favorable re
- of it. have been sent to prom
inent Catholic professors in this city.
The most enthusiastic review of.Pere
bsus' work is from Rev. Charles
Magnien, whose book on the life of
Father Hecker called forth the Pope's

Probably most of them will receive
permits allowing the mine to work, but
the other mines will have to wait until
an acceptable class of men come in. As
far as known no mine operators will at

are anxious to secure men who can get

MOORISH GOVERNMENT

It is stated to-night by a high authority

Lady Broome of Santa Barbara Ap

Behalf.
SANTA RA'RBARA. May P.â Several
wo.ks ago Lady Francis Broome. an Eng

which to engage oth<--r counsel.
When the case came up this morning

This Judge Day declined to do. Bay-
Ing that the law did not intend that the
courts should appoint counsel to defend
persons able to employ defense. Lady
Broome expressed her willingness to pay
th< feea of an attorney, but said sh<- had
not engaged one because she thought all
of the lawyers of this city were prejudiced
t her and she was afraid to trust

She was willing, though, to pay any
costs If Judge Day would appoint some
member of the local bar. The Judge firm

Broome asked for a month's time in
which to make the selection, but the
court granted but ten days.
On leaving the courtroom she was heard
to remark that she would send to San

FIGHTING THE POOLROOMS.
Plan Favored by the "Hill Tribes" of
Sausalito.
SAUSALITO. May 9.â The "hill tribes"
are again to the fore as antagonists of
the water front on the poolroom question,
and have enlisted among their cohorts
the District Attorney and the Supervisors
of Marin County. An effort will be made
to prevent the poolrooms opening on the
16th inst., the battle to be made along the
lines laid down by the District Attorney.
Not only do three of the Town Trustees
intend to see that poolrooms are licensed
this year, but they will grant a license
to Kingsley & Co.. making three estab
lishments that will sell .pools on Eastern
races. The other two win be Harvey &
Co. and Humphrey <Â£.- Co.
Last evening District Attorney Mclsaac
was summoned to Sausalito by a com
mittee of Citizens and a conference was
held. In view of the opinion of the Su
pervisors that as the electors voted in
favor of the poolrooms last year, some
thing should be done to show a change of
heart, it was decided to draw up a peti
tion to be signed by the property owners
and present it to the board. All the mem
bers of that body have said they would
try to do away with the poolrooms in case
they were petitioned to do so by a large
number of citizens.
It is expected that the method employed
will be to license the poolrooms at a
figure which will virtually amount to pro
hibition. The county fathers are san
fuine that such a license will have the
esired effect.
NOT EXCLUDED

POSSESSIONS
Chinese Are Not Yet Shut

MEIKLEJOHN SO RULES
Extension of the Immigration Laws
Interpreted Not to Inolude
the Exclusion Act.
Srecia! Dispetch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, May 9.â Acting Sec
retary of War Meiklejohn said to-day
that the Chinese exclusion act did not
apply to our insular possessions.
Some three weeks ago an order was
issued extending the laws and regula
lations governing immigration to the
United States t<> the territory under
military control, and Collectors of Cus
toms were directed to enforce them
pending the establishment of regular
immigration stations. By some this or
der was interpreted to mean the ex
clusion of Chinese from Porto Rico,
Cuba and the Philippines. This is a
mistake. Mr. Meiklejohn says that thÂ«
order only extended the regular im
migration laws, not the Chinese exclu
sion act, and that there was no inten
tion for the present of making the lat
ter act applicable to our insular posses
sions.

WOODLAND, May 9.â Over a year ago, while he was District Attor
ney. K. E. Hopkins developed symptoms of serious mental aberration.
He realized his condition and was easily induced to enter a private
sanitarium at Livermore. A few months ago he returned home but little
improved, if any. His friends and family have since been very. much
worried about his condition. They reluctantly concluded to take steps
to keep him under restraint, at least until there were evidences of im
ment.
This morning Mr. Hopkins was taken into custody. He neither man
ifested surprise nor made a show of resistance, but seems to be very
anxious to know who swore to the complaint. He was examined by
Judge Gaddis and F>rs. Lawhead and Royles, and was committed to the
Napa Asylum for the insane.
While the examination was in progress Mr. Hopkins realized its Im
port. In his own behalf he made a statement. He related his experi
a;id success in prosecuting criminal cases and cited numerous civil
lr which he had been successful. He described his experience
while in the sanitarium at Livermore. He declared that th>^ doctor told
him if there was anything the matter with his mental faculties he could
not discover it. He also declared that he had been attending to his own
business and molesting no one and that in his opinion he was not in
sane. He will ask the asylum officials to make a full investigation of

sympathy Is expressed for the unfortunate man. At one time he gave
promise of becoming: one of the leading lawyers of the State. His many

LARKSPUR'S UPPER TEN
TO TOIL ON SUNDAY
Society Leaders Will Assist in Lay-
ing a Sidewalk That Has Long
Been Needed.
LARKSPUR, May 9. One of the oddest
spectacles ever seen in a suburban village
may br witnessed hero free of charge on
next Sunday, when the elite <>f Larkspur
will turn out irrespective of age or sex
and lay 220fl feet of sidewalk. Kverybndy
will come supplied with tools, and it is
)!.â¢â  Intention to complete the laying of
the required sidewalk in one day, even
though it be the day commonly conse
crated to rest throughout the Christian
world.
For several years Larkspur has boon re
carded as an ideal Hummer resort, and a
large number of metropolitan residents
annually stake out their camps in Tamal
pais Canyon and there spend the season
delightfully in the proves by the banks
of a rippling stream. Hut the road lead
ing to this canyon 1? very dusty, and
'â 'unplaint has frequently been made on
this score by the summer visitors. As a
result a meeting of citizens was held a
few evenings ago, and it was decided that
the town show its appreciation of the
visitors by building a sidewalk to the
canyon.
The little schooner Eva arrived last
night with the necessary lumber. The
beginning: of the walk will be at the sta
tion of the North Pacific Coast Railroad
Company. After the work is completed a
bullshead barbecue will be held In the
canyon for all those who participated.
Music will be supplied by the L,arkspupr

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, 3iAf 10, 1899.
TONS OF FISH
GIVEN FREEDOM
Second Raid on Santa
Cruz Island.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, May 9.â Deputy
Sheriff Hopkins and Game Warden C.
A. Loud returned at midnight last
night from Santa Cruz Island with
three more fishermen, arrested for hav
ing violated the State and county game
and fish laws. These, with the five
who were brought over several days
ago, complete the force of men in the
employ of the San Pedro Tanning Fac
tory, whose depredations were called to
"the attention of the State Fish Com
mission and the Game Warden. They
.have b*en shipping tons of crawfish to
San Pedro from these islands in viola
tion of the law, under which the season
closed on May 1.
Twenty-one cages of fish, containing
j about ten tons, were found and Liber
ated. These had been caught recently
I and were just being put aboar.i a ves
j sel for shipment to the factory.
Of the first five men arrested on
; Santa Cruz, two have pleaded guilty
and paid heavy fines. The case of an.-
I other was heard before Judge Wheaton
j and a jury to-day, the District Attor
â  ney representing the prosecution and
11. C. Booth the defendant, Peter Lind.
! Lind was accused of having taken and
had in his possession two tons of live
crawfish on May 5, 1899. The plosed
season on crawfish begins on April 15.
1 The case will go to the jury to-morrow
[morning. From the questions pro
. pounded to the jurors and the witnesses
it seems that the defense will be that
the waters surrounding Santa Cruz
Island are not within the jurisdiction
j of the State; that the boundaries of
! the State, while extending three Kng
lish miles from the main land, take in
' the islands but not the waters sur
| rounding them; that the ordinance of
â  the Supervisors proviSing for a pun
! ishment for having crawfish in posses
i sinn during the close season without
specifying where they were taken is
â¢â  extraterritorial and beyond the juris
diction of the Board of Supervisors.
The captain of the San Pedro Com
pany's schooner and his mate were the
only witnesses for the defendants.
Charles Vogelsang, secretary of the
State Fish and dame Commission, was
in attendance and helped the prosecu
tion.
Santa Cruz Island has been claimed
by Mexico and has been disputed
ground for many years. Like Santa
i Rosa Island, owned by the A. P. More
; estate, and San Miguel, owned by Cap
tain W. G. Waters. Santa Cruz Island
;is a principality in itself. A number
of years ago A. 1". More, who had
j murdered a Chinaman, escaped punish
ment for his crime because the trial
Judge ruled that the waters surround
ing the islands w. p- not under the
' State's jurisdiction. It is currently un
derstood that th< case tried to-day is
a test in the Interest of ih>- San Pedro
Company, although this is denied by
â  the attorney f<> r the defense. The craw
i fiish industry of the islands, it is esti
mated, is worth several hundred thou
, sand dollars a year to the canners.

CLAIMED HE WAS
PAID TO TESTIFY
Alleged Admission of a
Witness.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, May 9.â The Murdock
note case is drawing to a close. When
court convened this morning Mr. Lusk
said he desired to prove by Witness W.
P. Harrington that William Murdock
had $50,000 in bank in May, IS9O. This,
the attorney said, was to contradict the
testimony of Witness Skiff, who swore
that Mrs. Mary Helen Murdock had
asked "Uncle Billy" for the payment of
interest on the note and that he had re
fused. Attorney Johnson objected to
such testimony, and his objection was
sustained.
Adam Compton was called, and Mr.
Lusk handed to him a note for $24,000,
made by William Murdock to a man
named Singletary. Mr. Compton was
asked why this note was given. Mr.
Lusk said he wished to show that the
note was given, not for money loaned,
but as a part payment on the Calvin
ranch. Attorney Johnson's objection
was sustained and Mr. Compton was
excused.
Mr. Lusk said that with the exception
<if two witnesses the defense was ready
to rest. Johnson wanted to know the
names of these two witnesses, but the
court would not* allow it. With this
understanding the defense rested.
Seth Millington was called. He said
he had been Judge of the Glenn County
Superior Court. He was present in
court when Witness T. J. Kirkpatrick
testified; he hoard the testimony of
Kirkpatrick and remembered the* aili
davit purporting to have been made to
Kirkpatrick by Samuel Murdock. At
the time of the giving of this testimony
he heard Expert Carl Eisenschimel say
to Expert Theodore Kytka: "Get that
affidavit, Kytka; take a photograph of
it and we'll knock it out," or words to
that effect.
.Mrs Mary Helen Murdock, the plain
tiff was called and told of having gone
t<. Deadwood In April, 1881, returning
home in July. Attorney Johnson said
thai all this was to contradict the tes
timony of W. S. Murdock. who had re
lated certain conversations of plaintiff
to htm at her home during June, 1881.
The witness denied having conversed
with c S. Young and L. S. Megginson
at the Arlington, in San Francisco. She
never spoke of this not.- to Young, She
said she had heard the testimony ol
George G. Murdock. Mrs. Lizzie Smith
and Mrs. Ellen Murdock. She reraem-r
bered having been at the Murdock
home at Upper Lake, but she never
made th< remarks about "Uncle Billy"
attributed to her by these witnesses.
Mrs Murdock denied that she and
Megginson left Young at the Arlington
and returned with J3oooin money which
W as to !â <â  a "make-believe" payment
on the note sin- also denied any knowl

LEGAL CONTEST FOR
AN IMMENSE TRACT
David Jacks' Claim to Pueblo Lands
of the City of Monterey
Is Argued.
SALJNAS, May The case of the city
of Monterey vs. David Jacks and others
to determine title to some 35, I acres of
land known as the Pueblo Lands of tho
city of Monterey, was tried before Judge
Dorr to-day. Jacks claims this land by
virtue of a deed dated February, 1839, in
which J. Burke Phillips, J. D. Callaghan
and Salvador Osce as trustees of Mon
terey City, for a consideration of $100250,
sold' the lands to D. K. Ashley and David
Jacks. The Bale was made under author
ity of an act of the State. Legislature to
â¢ pay the city's Indebtedness to Ashley for
legal services. Ashley in 1868 sold his In
terests to Jacks. On the other side, the
city of Monterey claims that the act of
the trustees in making the sale was illegal
In that it is a recognized doctrine of law
that no sale of Pueblo lands could be
1 made in one lump.
The case was hotly contested and much
documentary evidence was offered, after
which it was submitted to Judge Dora for
a decision. As there are numerous
ranches and town settlements on these
disputed lands, disturbance of title would
affect a large number of pe'pple.
McKINLEY'S DAY OF REST.
The President's Vacation at Hot

HOT SPRINGS, Vh., May 9.â President
McKinley baa had n day of thorough rest.

here. Official business did not Interrupt

well-kept lawn to the rolling ground upon

walked he passed a bright-faced "caddy,"
who, without knowledge of whom he was

President and said: "Say, mister, can you
Kimme do toime?" The President drew

DIDN'T KNOW HE
WAS DIVORCED
Surprise for a San Ra
fael Deacon.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May 9.â The "hoodoo
organ" of the First Methodist Church
of this city, which broke up a revival
meeting a few weeks ago and came near
dividing the church into factions, is in
directly responsible for the greatest
sensation ever sprung in local church
circles. Contrary to his wish, and with
out his knowledge, the wife of Deacon
W. W. Woodard, who -took such a
prominent part in the revival imbroglio,
is alleged to have married another man
at Reno, New, the result being that the
deserted husband is grief-stricken and
the church members horrified, while
Dame Grundy is rolling the story
around her tongue as a sweet morsel.
The first intimation of any trouble in
the Woodard family that reached the
public came at the time of the trouble J
over the church organ during the late '
revival. Deacon Woodard was attacked
by two wrathful ladies, who declared
he had insulted them. In response the
deacon shed tears and dubbed the or
gan a "hoodoo," adding that it had
broken up his happy home and caused
his wife to absent herself on a visit
to relatives. Prior to that time Mrs.
Woodard was supposed to be merely on
a visit to her sister, Mrs. ' Owens, at
Michigan Bar, in Calaveras County.
A short time ago word reached the
family of B. Brenilick at San Anselmo
from a former resident of that village
named Clara Traxler that Mrs. Wood
ard had been divorced and remarried.
The news was kept quiet until it could
be verified and a letter was sent by one |
of the members of the church to S. C. j
Shearer, the Recorder of Washoe i
County, Nevada, where the ceremony
was said to have taken place. In re
sponse Recorder Shearer said Emiline
Woodard had been married to Harry j
Nightingale at Reno on July 23, 1898, |
Justice J. J. .Linn performing the cere
mony. The marriage was witnessed by
W. J. Barber and K. W. Saunders.
The fact that the marriage took place
at Reno would show that the divorce
was granted In thi.s State, but Deacon
Woodurd asserted to-day he was as
ignorant of his wife's divorce and re
marriage a? "the man in the moon,"
and that no summons had ever been
Berved on him. Dispatches from Sacra
mento and San Andreas, the county
seat of Calaveras County, elicit the in
formation that there is no record of the
divorce having been granted in either
county. This adds the element of mys
tery to the affair, even though Deacon
Woodard admitted recently to Silas P.
Stimson, a fellow church member, that
he had lately learned of the marriage
of his wife. Even to Stimson the dea
con denied all knowledge of a divorce.
Another peculiar fact in connection
with the affair is that four months
Mrs. Woadard visited the deacon here,
who thought himself still her husband,
but she took ui> her abode in a different
part of the house from that occupied
by him. She then returned to Michigan
Bar, taking the most of her wearing
apparel.
Deacon Woodard's wife is a relative
of Mrs, McKee, a prominent society
woman of Oakland, and a sister of
Capitalist John D. Wright. Her fathef
was the celebrated "Bully" Wright, a
si a captain well known along the Paci
â¢ 'oast years ago.

â  incts and districts of the

ters is nothing new with them.
The present State Central Committee, at
its meeting on Thursday next, may rlx
things up so that the Committee of One
Hundred will have no power to act on
the apportionment proposition, should the
State Committee not interfere. The Dem
ocrats opposed to the one hundred are so
confident of their strength in being able
to annihilate that body that they care but
very little what manner of apportionment
will be made, whether at large by di?
tricts or precincts.
The law, however, clearly shows on its
face that delegates to party conventions
must be elected by precincts, and the ef
forts to have them elected at large dem
onstrates that those who were the loudest
in their demand to give the voters a fair
chance at a primary are now enlisted in
an attempt to ignore the true base of
political actionâ the precinct.
The leaden of the One Hundred are
vainly giving out the word that the Buck
ley and liney followers are the only ele
ments opposed to the regime that has
brought disaster and disorganization to
the party. While it is true that Buckley
has opened headquarters in the Baldwin
Annex and is sending for people as of old;
while it is probably true that Rainey is
watching with anxious eye the trend of
events and awaits an opening to break
inâ although up to date those who are
supposed to be close to the Fire Depart
ment boss have made no sign of open or
ganizationâ yet it seems that the followers
of both Buckley and Rainey, although op
posed, no doubt, to the Committee of One
Hundred-, represent a very small propor
tion of Democrats who eagerly await the
opportunity to give the One Hundred bat
tle.
For the time being it would seem that
all elements have pooled their issues and
have determined to wipe out the last ves
tige of the f -appointed committee, be
lieving that when this is accomplished the
chances for Democratic victory will be
much brighter.
The hope is entertained by many Demo-
rats that the Committee of One Hundred
will place a ticket in the field at the pri
mary, and should this be done the antag
onism that will develop against it by con
servative anti-boss Democrats will beÂ»
made manifest, and the attempt on the.
part of the One Hundred to pose as the
only anti-boss Democrats must neces
sarily fall to the ground.

The great Shasta region has become
immensely popular as a place of resort.
It has such unusual attractions In the
way of scenery and opportunities for
pleasurable pursuits that it only needs
to be well known to become the fore
most pleasure ground of the West.
For camping hunting, fishing and all
manner of beneficial recreation it is
probably without an equal, all other
advantages considered, and few places
are known that surpass it for types of
the heroic grandeur in scenery. its
climate is healthful In a high degree,
and the conveniences for enjoyable.
habitation are to be found in dozens of
inviting places along the line of the
gre"at Shasta route.
The ease and cheapness with which
this delightful country can be reached
from the thickly populated centers is
naturally the key note of its rapid
growth in public favor.
Colonel William H. Menton, the well
known excursion passenger agent of
the Southern Pacific Company, will he
in charge of the pn.rty and will see to
it that exrursioniÃts are well cared for.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 10, 1899.

Johnny Relff. â¢with thp body of a lillipu
tlan and the head of a statesman, la now
the premier jockey riding at Oakland.
Up Is hlessed with horse sense fnr beyond
his years, and some day will make Tod
Sloan look llkp a misfit,, suit of clothes.
Yesterday, after twice finishing- unplaced
and once second, this precocious young
ster landed the last three winners on the
card. Mis most notable achievement was
on the back of flying Mary Plnck. favor
ite for the mile purse run. It was some
yards further than the mare likes to
travel, but Johnny took her out in front,
opening up a big gap of daylight be
tween his mount and the field. At the
end she was fast fading away, lasting,
however, just long enough to heat Daisy
F a neck in 1:40%. The little fellow re
ceived a mild ovation on his return to
th.- stand.
The caliber of the different fields was
below the average, and the speculating
w;is limited. Three favorites earned
brackets.
Ed PiirsT 1 ? filly Honor Bright was
plunged on to win the two-year-old
scramble, which opened the day's racing.
Backed down from G to 2 to l.she hroke
in front of her field, but. quickly fell
bn^k. running unplaced. In a hard drive
Jenkins landed <iiga. the second choice,
winner a head before Tanobe.
Fortis, the 2 to l favorite for the mile
pelling race, with Johnny Reiff on her
back, received a poor start, finishing
second to Cabrillo. The latter horse, ex
cellently handled by Ruiz, took the front
position in the stretch, winning handily
by over a length in 1:42 V After cutting
up big capers out in front, Bontta ran
third.
Several good things were cut adrift in
the selling sprint that followed. The \
field was made up of a very trashy bunch
of horseflesh, and, best ridden, Lothian, a
6 to 1 chance, bricked down to 4. downed
Pompino a head. Racebud led into th"
stretch, but could not last it out.
It looked as if the fifth number, also a
six-furlong dash, was a "set up" for
Rubicon, and the books were speedily '
compelled to rub the 2 to 5 posted against
the big horse. Peixotto became suddenly I
afflicted with a speed spasm, and the fa- ;
vorite was hard ridden to win by a head

COURSING AT INGLESIDE.
It Will Not Be Resumed Until the
Directors Can See Their Way
Clear From Interference.
The directors of the Inglf-side Coursing
Club held a special meeting last evening
In the Murphy building to discuss the fu
ture of the Ingleslde Park and the prob
ability of resuming the old sport In the
old grounds in the near future. The pres
ident of the club, D. Shannon, saiil that it
would be very poor policy on the part of
the Ingleslde Coursing Association to
take any advantage of a technicality in
the law and open up the sport again
without a full knowledge of the situation.
He advocated patience in the matter, and
said that by using a little discretion af
fairs pertaining to the leash would event
ually come out all right.
The directors agreed with their presi
dent not to violate the law in any man
ner and as a consequence Ingleside Park
will not resume business until its officers
can see their way clear to promote the
sport of coursing without interference.

NEW RACE TRACK IN
SAN MATEO COUNTY
TURF MEN ENGAGED IN A BIG
VENTURE.
Since the passing of the resolution by
the Board of Supervisors prohibiting
gambling; on horse races in the city and
county of San Francisco turfmen have
been designing to overcome the obstacle
which has thus been east in the way of
the sport. "Without the pernicious Ram
bling attendant upon it the running of
horses has been found to be non-produc
ing to the pockets of the promoters. After
lngleside had been closed for this reason
a suitable location was sought in an ad
joining county, 'ihe Western Turf Asso
ciation is the name of the concern re
cently organized for that purpose, and is
largely composed of members of the Pa
cific Coast Jockey Club, although both
bodies disclaim any connection with one
another. Papers of incorp 'ration which
have been filed with the Clerk of Sa:a
Mateo County fix the capital stuck at
$250,000. and name W. .T. Martin. William
Rehberg. Julius Kikerenkoter. F. H.
Green and Charles Gardner as directors.
Henry J. Crocker of the Jockey Club is
one of tho heaviest stockholders. Daniel
Meyer, the Pine-street banker, and E. R.
Lllienthal, the commission merchant, will
contribute considerably to the backing of
the venture.
The proposed new racing track will cost
nearly $100,000. It will be located near the
old San Bruno station, in South San Fran
cisco, and 200 acres of land have recently
been purchased fmrn the South San Fran
cisco Land and Improvement I'nmpany
for the purpose of its construction.
Tlii eround is as level as a floor and tha
soil is admirably adapted to the proposed
purpose. Ihe location is within easy
reai h of the city, and the trip may b'a
made on tho Southern Pacific Company's
c(-i;is; 'in' in less than thirty minutes.
As soon as the new line along the bay is
completed this schedule time will be cut
fifteen minutes. The bay ferry-boats can
approach within half a mile of the place
by going up the San Bruno basin.

THE PANHANDLE EXTENSION.
THIS caption is an apt physical description of
the proposed extension to Van Ness avenue of
the boulevard, lined with trees and decorated
with flowers, that new connects with the entrance to
Golden Gate Park. P.y our own citizens it is well
understood.. Hut to visiting strangers or in other
m foreign countries it conveys no adequate
conception of an improvement that so long as San
Francisco lasts will attest its enterprise and its artistic I
skill in blending utility and beauty in exquisite pro
portions. â¢
Golden Gate Park is an existing reality of which the
and the nation have reason to be proud. The
conversion of a mass of barren sand swept by the
'. winds into a combination of natural felicities
i~ the perfection of genuine art, into which the service
â  soil, of the tlora of all lands, of birds of
-t plumage and even of the animal kingdom
i impressed. The alternation of smooth lawns
ring with vernal beauty, glinting lakes, secluded
i from the roaring world, wooded hills
I with the aroma of the pine, beds and banks of
ers brilliant with diversified colors and odorous
with delicate scents, constitutes a variegated picture of
as charming to the eye as it is soothing to
tired brain. The aviary, the conservatory, the mu
seum unite the-contributions of all zones and of past
The playground with its appropriate structures
unds with the joyful notes of innocent and irre
-lble childhood. In the zoological department,
â¢ only in its infancy, the old hunter and trapper
revive the scenes of the distant mountains, where
health and his muscular strength originated. The
broad and solid avenues, free from dust and lined with
the trees of the forest and with floral borders, attract
the equipages of the rich and the humble con
â¢ i those whose chief endowment is their
American citizenship. There too the modern centaur
glides with his wheeled substitute for his own legs.
And in the labyrinth of paths, quiet and lovely as the
recesses of the Sierras, where murmuring waters
chant the praises of solitude, bookmen plunge into
literary idealism, lovers whisper the story of eternal
harmony and the true paternalism of the world feeds
the affections on domestic socialism.
The Golden Gate Park is a perpetual monument to
the memory of the dead and to the disinterested labors
of the living. Its management has been and is almost
unique in its intelligence, in its integrity and in its
. ffectiveness. Its praises have spread to international
distances. No description of the West has been in
ted by its omission.
The extended boulevard, projecting its melodious
invitation to rest, to purity, to the cleansing renova
tions of rural beauty into the very center of our tu
multuous city, as it will speedily be fashioned, is more
than expedient, for it is essential. There is no point of
view in which this contention is disputable. If the
symmetrical development of communities is part of
the American system, then the artistic is as important
a> the merely utilitarian element, as in these modern
days the experiences and the examples of aggregated
everywhere attest. There is no physician for
the body like pure air freshly wafted from the sea
and tempered by sylvan obstructions. There is no
medicine for the intellect like embowered rest and
peace. There is no tonic for the soul comparable to
the tender suggestions of clean and soliciting nature.
The Call cannot question the success of the addi
tional boulevard, which in its returns of every sort,
not only among ourselves but in our external rela
tion?, within a generation will repeatedly multiply its
cost. Our local columns yesterday noticed the ex
pected corporation of improvement associations,
which will be a decisive influence in favor of the
project But its elective indorsement should be unan
imous.
HONORS FOR THE BRAVE.
IZI^ ROM every point of view the efforts now being
made by Native Sons and Daughters to provide
medals of honor for the California Volunteers
serving in the Philippines are commendable and de
serve general support. It is right and fitting that a
proud commonwealth should recognize by some ap
propriate decoration the service of those who have
upheld her honor in war, and since the State cannot
act through her officials in the matter, by reason of
the peculiar character of her Governor, it is most ap
propriate that the organizations which represent her
native manhood and womanhood should act for her.
The steps which have been taken to provide the
funds necessary for the procurement of the medals
have been well devised. The amount of money to be
raised is not large when the wealth of the State and
the dignity of the object are considered. The sum
desired by the joint committee having the matte: in
charge is $20,000, and to raise it none will have to give
much if each patriotic citizen will bear his share.
The California Volunteers have well merited the
honors which it is proposed to bestow upon them.
Their discipline and their valor have been distin
puished during the whole course of the campaign and
have won the commendation of the generals in com
mand and of the President. The colonel of the regi
ment has been promoted to the rank of brigadier
and two other officers have been chosen for appoint
ment to the regular army, that being the only method
by which under our law the President could mark the
nation's appreciation of the service of the regiment.
Each State having volunteers at the front will of
course take steps to honor them. California should
rfot be second to any in the nature or the extent of
the rewards she bestows upon her sons. Each of
them has won by the arduous service of deeds done
the medal of honor the Native Sons and Daughters
are now preparing to bestow upon them, and every
citizens should take pride in being able to contribute
to the fund and thus share in the honors conferred.
The flower of Aguinaldo's army is said to be at
Bacolor. Guess which American general will be the
first to wear it on his coat*
THE LAW STANDS.
THE prediction of The Call that Justice of the
Peace Groezinger, sitting in Judge Treadwell's
department of the Police Court, would dismiss
the remaining cases against bookmakers and others
for violations of order 174 was promptly verified. The
ridiculous assumption by this Justice of the Peace,
first, that there were irregularities in the passage of
the order, and, second, that these irregularities con
stituted a fatal breach of the State constitution, de
serve no further comment.
Rut the decision of Judge Murasky in the injunction
suit against the Police Department is of a different
complexion. It seems that the police claimed the
right forcibly to enter the inclosure of the Ingleside
racetrack simply to ascertain whether the law was
being violated or not. This position is clearly inde
fensible. The Pacific Coast Jockey Club has the same
right to the peaceful enjoyment of its property that
any citizen has to his house or his store. If the po
lice know that a crime is actually being perpetrated
within the inclosure, or if a complaint has been filed
and a warrant issued against a defendant who is in
side, if necessary they can break in for the purpose
of making an arrest. But no policeman has an official
right to force his way into any premises merely to
gratify his curiosity.
This is the substance of Judge Murasky's decision,
in which individual rights and the interests of the pub
lic are carefully guarded. He declares the law in a
perfectly clear and satisfactory manner. The evi
dence before him showed that the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club was obeying the order and making no
threats to violate it or to evade its provisions. The de
fense was that the municipality, through its police,
had legal authority gratuitously to attend the races
for the sole purpose of observation. This defense
Judge Murasky holds to be untenable and against
the unfounded claim of the police, as practically as
serted, he exercised the functions of a chancellor by
the issue of a permanent injunction.
But, while he enforces the rights of ownership, on
the one hand, he is equally careful to uphold the order
en the other. His discriminations show the precision
of his reasoning and the integrity of his attitude.
"The defendants are peace officers and cannot be
restrained from performing their duties; they have a
right to enter the premises of the plaintiff, without its
consent, in the performance of their duties and in the
manner provided by law, but not otherwise."
In other words, police officers can force their way
anywhere to serve a warrant, regularly issued, or to
arrest a man, at the moment and within their obser
vation or positive knowledge engaged in the commis
sion of an offense, whether a misdemeanor or a felony.
Sections 836 (subdivision 1), 844 and 849 of the Penal
Code, among other constitutional and statutory pro
visions, cover this point. But if an officer is searching
for facts upon which a criminal prosecution can be
founded he has no greater rights than a private citi
zen. In the case of the Ingleside track there was a
pardonable excess of zeal on the part of the police.
But there is nothing to prevent them from discovering
breaches of the law there in the usual and ordinary
way. They must pay their admission fee, and then
they can act upon the facts within their observation.
Judge Murasky, although the same technicalities
were argued before him that convinced the Justice of
the Peace, was careful to avoid any assertion of the
invalidity of order 174. It was unnecessary to his de
cision to make any formal ruling on that question.
But his entire proceedings in the case must have
bc-en based on the presumption that it had been legally
passed, because if the order had been void the plain
tiff, without testimony, was clearly entitled to the re
lief sought.
It dnes not appear that any re-enactment of the
order is necessary. It stands as a protection to the
community, which can be effectively enforced through
the loyal performance of official duty.
THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRUSTS.
WHEN great combinations of capitalists began
some years ago to form what are called "trusts"
for the management of important industries it
was generally accepted by the public that the object of
such associations was to raise prices by crushing out
competition and establishing virtual monopolies. They
were suspected of interfering with the natural order of
economic development, and in the legislation directed
against them they were described as associations
formed for "restraint of trade."
The experience of the last few years has taught all
classes of intelligent men that such associations, so far
from raising to consumers the prices of articles pro
duced by the trusts, have had the* effect of reducing
prices, and so far from restraining trade have so de
veloped it and stimulated it that America, which a
short time 'ago hardly produced enough manufactured
goods to supply her own people, has now become one
of the largest exporters of such goods on the globe.
The stimulating effects of the trusts upon American
enterprises have been noted by . acute observers
abroad. Lord Revelstoke, a member of the banking
house of Baring Brothers & Co. and a director of the
Bank of England, in a recent interview concerning the
rapid development of such combinations in this coun
try, said:
These combines appear to be of immense advan
tage. Wildcat schemes will undoubtedly be formu
lated from time to time, but great organizations
of Industry in America have, in my opinion, in most
cases resulted in undoubted economy of labor and
expense of management, and have been beneficial in
financial and other results. Englishmen hardly yet
appreciate the force and potentiality of the present
movement, but there will soon be a revulsion of
public opinion in favor of these combinations. Amer
ica is going forward by leaps and bounds, and will
make things extremely uncomfortable for British
industry if we of England do not recognize more ful
ly that vast capital enterprise, as opposed to more
limited individual venture, can only end in favor of
the former, and that is where America is now get
ting her pull.
It may now be said that throughout the United
States the people have begun to understand the value
of such combinations. They are made use of not only
by manufacturers but by farmers In California we have
seen the upbuilding of a raisin growers' association
and a wine producers' association, both of which have
produced good results, and there are now in process of
formation other combinations to manage the mar
keting of prunes and of canned fruit of all kinds.
Last winter certain Democratic leaders, desirous of
relieving the paity of Bryanism and free silver, started
an anti-trust campaign in the expectation of making
that the leading issue of 1900, thus paving the way for
the nomination of a new candidate for the Presidency.
Although the campaign was worked up with great
industry and political cunning, it failed utterly. The
New York Herald, which made a special investiga
tion of the subject, has summarized the results by
saying:
Sentiment in the State Legislatures, at their most
recent sessions, is apparently more in favor of the
trusts than in 'Tpogitinn. The proposition to have
Southern Legislatures put the trust issue to the
front, in order to disconcert Bryan, has not worked
well. One after another they are adjourning without
doing anything.
Such is the prevailing sentiment at present in ail
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL,, WEDNESDAY, MAY lU, ISJW.
parts of the Union. The abuse of trusts must of
course be prevented, just as abuse of any other form
of industrial management,^but there is no longer any
intelligent antagonism to this form of co-operative
work as such. In fact communities that cannot or
j ganize large combinations will be forced to the wall
in the competition of industrial life, and the trusts will
win.
THE SMELLING OF ILOILO.
A SCOTCHMAN, owning property in Iloilo, has
6tated that the United States naval officer gave
notice that in twenty-four hours he would shell
the city, but that the shelling began almost imme
diately, resulting in the wanton destruction of a large
amount of property belonging to foreign residents,
for which the United States must pay. It has also
been stated that claims of foreigners for destruction
of their property in the Philippines, now made against
our Government, amount to ten millions of dollars.
As American taxpayers must furnish the money, we
suppose they may be permitted to inquire into the
facts and to inform themselves as to the necessity for
running up these enormous accounts for damages.
Already a navy officer has formally objected to the
promotion of General Miller, the army officer in
charge of the Iloilo expedition. This naval com
plaint states that the navy captured the city and there
fore deserves the credit. This protest is formal no
tice to the country of the existence of a spirit of
rivalry and jealousy between the, two branches of the
service in the Philippines.
We have a letter from an artillery officer, written
March 1 from Jaro, province of Iloilo, Panay Island,
which says:
"On the morning of the nth the fight began, many
hours ahead of time. There are two sides to the story,
but I am inclined to believe that unnecessary haste
was used, and that the long standing rivalry between
the army and navy precipitated matters. As it is, the
navy claims what cheap honor there was in the cap
ture of the town. General Miller, as commander in
chief of the forces operating in the Visayas, was
neither notified nor consulted by the navy officers.
I was with him, and three Filipino Embassadors who
had just returned from Malolos with a message from
Aguinaldo allowing the Visayas to make a peaceful
agreement with us in regard to our occupying the
country. We were exchanging friendly words when
suddenly the report of a gun startled us. The Fili
pinos were worried; I glanced out and beheld the
Pcjrel shelling Iloilo. Turning to Avencena, one of
the Peace Commissioners from Malolos, I told him
it was too late to talk peace, that hostilities had begun,
and that the insurgents would at once receive a ter
rible punishment for their misconduct. The Commis
sioners were terribly frightened and begged me to
put them ashore. I told them I had no boat at my
disposal, but if they remained with us they would
suffer no injury. They were but half reassured, and
were forced to witness the terrible events which fol
lowed."
It will be remembered that Rios, the Spanish com
mander, surrendered Iloilo to the Filipinos when we
had no force present and had made no warlike
demonstration there. The city and province had re
mained in their peaceful possession, and they had
maintained order and administered government there.
The tact that their Commissioners were in consul
tation with General Miller, arranging for our peace
ful occupation of the province, and that before the
Filipinos had made a hostile demonstration, and be
fore the expiration of twenty-four hours' notice to
foreign Consuls, and without notice to General Mil
ler, the commander in chief, the navy officers took
the initiative, shelled the city and caused "the ter
rible events which followed," makes a record of wan
ton aggression into which inquiry should be made
when the claims of foreign residents have to be paid
by the American people.
The singular statement of this artillery officer to the
Peace Commissioners that their people would be ter
ribly punished for their misconduct is difficult to un
derstand. They had received the surrender of Iloilo
from Rios before the Paris treaty was made, when we
had no shadow of sovereignty there. Sovereignty
passed from Spain directly to the Filipinos, and they
had only administered it over their conquest. If that
was misconduct, the word must receive a new inter
national definition.
The officer continues in his letter: "I heard from
3n officer of the Boston the reason why the bom
bardment began so early, and the excuse is a poor
one. The insurgents, it seems, had been seen throw
ing up a few earthworks near the fort. The Petrel im
mediately began shelling, and the Boston joined in.
The army was unprepared for landing and there fol
lowed a most irritating delay. At 9:40 the burning of
Iloilo began, and soon the entire city was a mass of
flames. The ships threw shells into the city and even
three miles beyond. The reports of the guns, the
bursting of the shells, the conflagratien, the firing of
our Gatling guns and mountain battery from the deck
of the Newport, made a scene never to be forgotten."
The letter closes by saying: "In a few days we are
to take the field into the interior, laying waste in our
path. We must treat these people as the Spanish did,
or even worse, if we expect to conquer them. After
we have absolutely crushed them we should sell the
whole country to Japan, or to any other country that
will take it. It will cost us more in lives and money
than it will be worth to us."
A Chinese highbinder of Sebastopol is under ar
rest for the murder of his brother. If the highbinders
of this city would only agree to confine the satisfac
tion of their instincts of assassination to such close
relationships Justice of the Peace Groezinger might
be allowed to fly in the face of a few more local laws.
The Wade military court of inquiry censures Gen
eral Miles for an "error" in not having promptly in
formed the Secretary of War that the canned beef
furnished to American soldiers was unfit for food.
The military court is discreetly silent to any estimate
of how many American lives that "error" cost.
General Merriam appears to be ungrateful, to say
the least. He has eaten his bread under the flag of the
Union for too many years for the public to allow to

ARE NOT READY
TO NAME THE
NEW PRESIDENT
University Regents
Take No Action.
FINANCES IN BAD CONDITION
HEROIC RELIEF MEASURES
MUST BE ADOPTED.
Income Increases But 33 1-3 Per Cent
in Ten Years, While the In
crease in Students Is 460
Per Cent.
The Regents of the University of Cali
fornia are not yet ready to enter upon the
responsible task of naming a president
of that great institution, of learning to
succeed Martin Keftogg. Some definite
action was expected at the regular meeti
ng of the Regents yesterday. For some
reason not apparent on the surface con
sideration of it went over until Friday of
this â week at 1 o'clock.
It required a long discussion to arrive
at this conclusion, as a difficulty was ex
perienced in selecting a day which would
be acceptable to everybody. The busy
men of the world found it impossible to
name a day acceptable to all. They all
agreed upon the importance of the meet
ing, as their action will have a direct
bearing upon the future of the university.
Friday was finally determined upon. The
matter will be discussed in executive ses
sion.
The finance committee presented a re
port, which indicates that stringent meas
ures must be adopted to place the univer
sity on a self-supporting basis. It is esti
mated that there will be a deficit of $47,000
for the next fiscal year, which must be
met. It was shown that while the income
of the university has increased but 33 1-3
per cent during the past ten years, the
number of students has increased 460 per
cent. The committee makes several sug
gestions as to a way out of the dilemma.
One is that there be a reduction in each
of the twenty-five or more departments of
instruction of from $1500 to J2OOO. The ob
jection which is raised to this is that the
standard or tone of the university would
suffer, as it would mean lower-salaried in
structors.
The second Suggestion was that a fee of
$20 a term, or $40 a year, be exacted from
each student. This carried with it the
proposition that the laboratory fees be |
reduced to equalize the charges between
the scientific and the literary depart
ments. It is not thought the suggestion
of a fee will be adopted, as the students
were once released from such a charge,
nnd it is held thr R'-gents have no power
tn reimpose it. The matter will be dis
cussed more fully at -ome future meeting.
Everett Schwartz, superintendent of
Wilmerding School, is to leave here at
once for the East to procure articles fur
the school which are not to be had here.
Contracts will be let for the school build
ing at once.
The summer school, attended largely by
country teachers, will open on the 29th
inst. and will continue six weeks. Regent
Budd objected to the date on the ground
that many schools will not close until July
1. The original date finally prevailed, as
it was shown to be most desirable.
A committee consisting of Regents Hal
lidie. Wallace and Houghton was appoint
ed to determine in whiU manner Regent
J. West Martin be complimented for his
twenty-seven years' service to the univer
sity.
Professor Frank Soule w-as thanked for
hi? services as military instructor during
the absence of Sydney Cloman in Manila.
It was suggested that in lieu of appoint
ing a successor to the latter that Pro
fessor Boule's salary be increased $25 per
month. Action was deferrred pending the
professor's reply.
The meeting was unusually well attend
ed, the Regents present being: Timothy
Guy Phelps. E. A. Denicke. J. E. Budd,
J. F. Houghton, W. T. Wallace. H. S.

SOLD IMPURE
PUTRID AND
TAINTED FOOD
Abe Stein in the Law's
Clutches.
DOCKERY MAKES THE ARREST
RAIDS VILE PREMISES ON
SIXTH STREET.
Large Quantities of Decomposed
Goods of All Descriptions Are
Confiscated and De
stroyed.
Chief Food Inspector James P. Dockery
and Deputies Lahanay and Davis made a
descent on the premises at 404M> Sixth
street yesterday and condemned and con
fiscated a large quantity of putrid and
vermin infested goods. The place is own
ed by Abe Stein, who was in the law's
clutches about a year ago for a similar
offense, but escaped conviction on
the technicality that he was not
caught in the actual selling of
the vile stuff. This time Dockery
says he has a clear case against Stein, as
he witnessed the purchase of a, can of
salmon for 5 cents which, when opened,
was found to be rotten.
Stein was immediately placed under ar
rest, but secured his release on $50 bail.
The section of the law under which Dock
ery acted provides that it shall be a mis
demeanor to place food on sale if it con
sists wholly or in part of diseased, de
composed, putrid, infected, tainted or rot
ten animal or vegetable substance or
article.
Nearly all the goods In Stein's store
come under this category. There were
boxes of figs, .lelliea, dried fruit, "swelled"
tins of sardines and cans of fruit and
other articles for consumption, which
were moldy, ill-smelling and filled with In
sect life. Rarks of warr-r soaked chocolate
and coffee, which tne worms had burrow
ed through, were lying around in full
view, and the wonder of it is that Stein
was able to ply his trade without being
discovered before this. The vile stuff will
be sent to the fertilizing works this
morning.
Stein sold his goods at a ridiculously
low rate. For instance, salmon and jellies
could be bought for 5 cents a can, though
his fellow-tradesmen in the neighborhood
asked 10 cents or more for them. Stein
had provided himself with a number of
new labels, which he put on the cans, not
even taking the trouble to remove the old
discolored label. The Banner Packing
Company and Sonoma Preserve Company
were his favorites, though he used others
to place on the spurious goods.
When Questioned in regard to his ques
tionable practices he got very much
tangled in his answers. First he said that
the stuff was not for sale and then in the
next breath that he sold only the pack
ages which had a small tag. He ad
mitted that some of the stuff was bad.
but he explained its presence by saying
that the scavenger only came around
once a week to take away what was not
good. He bought the goods at auction
sales, separated the good from the bad
and gave a guarantee to his customers
that what they bought was All right or
they could have their money back. He
naively said that every can was opened
before the buyer so he could satisfy
himself. It is said that whoever bought
a can of salmon from him never bought
a second one. Stein claims that he only
did a business of about 50 cents a day,
but this is not believed, as he pays $1S
rent.
Stein is a brother of the notorious
"Gashie" Stein, who was sent to San
Quentin for counterfeiting some years
ago. He has been at his present place of
business for nine years. The foul odors
which emanate from the place are un
bearable.
The punishment to which Stein is liable
under the pure-food law is a line of from
$25 to $100 or imprisonment for from 50 to
100 days or both.
CHINESE BUREAU COMPLETE.
F. D. Schuyler of Seattle Appointed
Inspector by the Secretary of
the Treasury.
Customs Collector Jackson received a
letter yesterday from the Secretary of
the Treasury announcing the appointment
by the Secretary of F. D. Schuyler of
Seattle as Chinese inspector to serve in
the Chinese Bureau at this port. The
Secretary writes that the appointment of
Mr. Schuyler fills the quota of Chinese
inspectors required to relieve the customs
inspectors from further duty in connec
tion with the enforcement of the exclu
sion law.
James R. Dunn, who was appointed by
the Secretary of the Treasury three
weeks ago as chief of the Chinese Bu
reau at this port, is expected to arrive in
a day or two. Mr. Flesh, who was ap
pointed chief temporarily by Collector
Jackson, and Mr. Urquhart, acting: as a
Chinese inspector, will resume their du
ties under the Surveyor of the Port as
soon as Mr. Dunn and Mr. Schuyler ar
rive. Mr. Flesh and Mr. Urquhart have
performed their duties in the bureau to
the satisfaction of the Collector and the
Government, and they will go on record
as being among the very few who have
left the bureau with good reputations.
Collector Jackson said yesterday that
he was pleased with the new order of
thing's. He had been confined to his of
fice day after day, he said, from 3 o'clock
in the afternoon until the vesper bolls
were chiming 6. engaged on work which
will henceforth be performed by the Chi
nese Bureau. The appointment of a bu
reau with its head and all its members
responsible direct to the Secretary of the
Treasury will relieve the Collector of a
vast quantity of work which can be done
just as well by the bureau and will leave
the Collector free to deal with the
Custom-house business, of which there is
plenty to keep a Collector busy all the
year round during working hours.

TO PREPARE
CUBANS FOR
CITIZENSHIP
United Brothers' Hard
Sense School.
TRUE MEANING OF LIBERTY
PRACTICAL LIFE TO BE TAUGHT
AT POINT LOMA.
Cuba's Patriots to Be Educated in
American Ideas and Methods
and Taught the Bit
of Labor. ;
Down at Point Loma, right across from
San Diego, the United Brotherhood is
er< '-ting a school, where Cubans will be
taught the hard practical lessons of life.
The institution is now in process of erec
tion, and Mrs. Tingley, who is the moving
spirit in .the work, hopes shortly to have
there a band of twenty-five ardent, anx
ious Cubans, who will profit by a practi
cal course of instruction in American
ideas and methods.
The object of the United Brotherhood
school is to teach the liberated Cubans
the true value of freedom and what lib
erty really means. It will be the aim of
those in charge of the institution to in
still into their followers the spirit of
thrift and industry and the regularity of
habit. When they have thoroughly con
quered these lessons of life they will be
sent back to their native land to proclaim
broadcast the nohle doctrine of work.
The Cubans will be educated in relays
at Point Lnma and very little "book
learning" will form part of the school
course. All the luxuries and comforts
that the "hard sense" pupils will enjoy
will be the result of their individual ef
forts and labors. There will not only be
talks on the manifold blessings of labor,
but practical experiences to illustrate the
same. Iverson L. Harris, superintendent
of the International Brotherhood league
colony work, will take charge of the
Point T.oma institution. Mr. Harris is an
attorney of national repute and eminent
ly fitted to be â¢'practical life" instructor
of the institution. V.'. F. Hanson, secre
tary and treasurer of the league, will as
sist Mr. Harris in the work.
Among the famous pupils who are pre
paring to learn the true meaning of lifo
ai Point Loma is Santiago Maeeo, son of
the noted Cuban patriot. A childish van
ity will be one of the chief habits that
Maceo will attempt tn overcome in the
hard sense school. The son of the great
man will also strive to cultivate a love
of good, hard, physical labor. The league
of the United Brotherhood claims that up
to the present the Cubans have not been
in a physical condition to labor, but that
they nave capacities in that direction that
are worthy of development.
Point Loma is also the site of the "tem
ple of the revival of the lost mysteries of
antiquity'" and contributions are now be
ing received from all parts of the globe
for the completion of that building.
To Watch the Mongols.
A. Q. Jones, formerly assistant cashier
of the Custom-house, has been appointed
by Collector Jackson to act as watchman
over the Chinese passengers at the Mail
dock waiting: a landing by the Chinese
Bureau. Two more watchmen will be ap
pointed to-day. The men relieved are
custom inspectors who will go back to
their regular duties.

V
It Flies Directly Over the Head of

Box.
If there is anything In Omens Peter TV.
McGlade, ex-deputy to former Superin
tendent of Streets Ambrose, now on tiia
for forgery before a jury in Judge Cook'
department of the Superior Court, should
account himself a lucky man. During th
progress of the case yesterday afternoon,
when the prosecution's strongest evident
was going in against the accused, a spar
row that had gained entrance to the
courtroom through a hole In one of th
windows, flew straight over his head,
swerved, and with many chirruping de
scended in the midst of the twelve men
in the jury box. It had been overcome by
the foul atmosphere of the room.
That was the only real incident in a
remarkably dull day in court. A large
number of witnesses wen examined, but
their testimony had to do only with the
street department demands, which, the
prosecution claims, were forged by Mc-
Glade. Writing Expert K\ tka. whose tes

made the customary number of curly cues
on the blackboard, smirked and smiled as
is his wont and left the evidence to be
proved by ordinary methods.
Th.' ten street department demands al
leged to have been forged and negotiated
by McGlade in July and August of last !
year contained the subject matter on
which all the witnesses of the morning
were examined. The testimony was in
terlarded with objections, but before the
noon adjournment Theodore Kytka, J. V.
Sullivan, T. Lynch. W. McGee. C. J.
Murphy and T. Dwyer were examined and
excused. Each testified that he knew Me-
Glade and answered in the negative when
asked- if they had signed or authorized
any person to sign their names to the de
mands offered in evidence. Charles S.

SPRING VALLEY
WATER RATES
FIRMLY FIXED
Decision Given by
Judge Seawell.
PROCEEDINGS ARE DISMISSED
BOARD CANNOT BE FORCED TO
RESCIND ITS ACTION.
Efforts of Â»W. J. Fifleid on Behalf of
the People of This City Are
Without Avail â Law of
the Case.
W. .T. Fifield and his attorney, Benjamin
&f organ, have met defeat in their efforts
to compel the Board of Supervisors to
make further investigation into the af
fairs of the Spring Valley Water Works
and ap;ain fix the water rates. Judge Sea
well yesterday handed down a decision
dismissing the action, and hence the rates
will remain as decreed by the board in
February last. Though the decision fa
vors the Supervisors, it does not decree
that the rate was properly fixed; it simply
holds that the court has no power to
compel the hoard to reconsider its actions,
and even though the rate was extortion
ate the people would be forced to bear
the burden until another year.
Shortly after the rate was fixed by thÂ£
Supervisors. Fitield, through his attorney,
tiled a petition for a writ of mandate to
('(impel the board to legally ttx the rate,
it being alleged in the petition that the
municipal legislative body had simply
"pretended" to fix the rate, such pre
tense not being sanctioned by law. The
petition said:
On January 9, 1599, the board met and passed
a resolution calling on the Spring Valley Water
Works to furnish a statement aa required by
law. Then the board adjourned. February S
the board met, received the resolution and then
adjourned. February 10 the board met and ad
journed. February 1* the board met and heard
the statements or Herman Schuesler, chief en
gineer of the corporation, and then adjourned.
February 23 th â¢ board met and heard the tes
timony of (3. F. Allar.lt and then adjourned,
and on February 27 the board met and adopted
the rate for the coming fiscal year.
in February 23, the petition continued, dur
ing the meeting of the board, Benjamin Mor
gan appeared and informed the board as to
the mode of procedure which should be ad
hered to in fixing the rate. The board wad
also requested to call George H. Mendell and
Charles W. Howard, but neglected to do so.
It is stated, On these few dates mentioned,
and these only, it is further contended, the
board investigated the corporation and then
fixed the water rate without due knowledge of
the financial condition and outlay on which
the corporation was entitled to Interest.
The petitioner further averred that the cor
poration's statement that the actual value of
its plant to Iv used in supplying the residents
of this city during the coming fiscal year it:
$25.000,<k* was false. This statement contains
vast properties, including the Calaveras reser
voir, Bearsville reservoir, water sheds of I'es
cadoro and San Qregorio creeks and Crystal
Springs dam, which will not be used in sup
plying the residents of this city. Mr. Fifleld
contends. The actual plant to be used, he
Bald, was not worth more than J10,000,000, on
which .i profit of $300. <W a year would be ample.
For these reasons he asked that thÂ« board be
compelled to further Investigate the matter
and art accordingly.
TliÂ» case was ht ml by Jui'^i-- Seawell,
sorni testimony was taken and tho o,is<?
submitted for dfoision upon a technicality
arising during the hearine;. Yesterday the
decision was handed down and the case
dismissed.
The decision is as follows:
This in hii application for a writ of mandate
r'-i-mlring; the defendant board to mak" a full
Investigation as to the value of the plant that
will be in actual use by thÂ« Spring Valley Water
wv.rks in supplying the Inhabitants of the city
and county with water for domestic nurposew
and flxlne as a ref.irn to oald cnmi-any for
such use a fair an le rate t > be paid
bj the 'â¢, nsumers.
It appears by plaintiff's affidavit that on
February "i, ]W9. the Hoard of Supervisors
ted en order fixing: water rates for the
fiscal year beginning July 1. IW. hut It is
claimed by plaintiff that said rat s are unrea
sonable and unjust in this, thru they will yield
to the water company a much iarp<-- r percentage
â "'f oroflt Hi... n the value ol said plant than it
Is lawfully entitled to receive.
It also appears by said affidavit that before
fixing said rates the board heard the statements
of the chief engineer of the water company and
the testimony of G. F. Allardt. and that when
Ren Morgan. Esq.. on behalf of the rate payers
called the attention of the board to the rule
governing the fixing of water lates and asked
that it examine as witnesses George If. Mi ndell
and Charles Webb Howard as to the value '"of
the plant of the water company, said board re
fused to hear Said witnesses.
It is also altered that in the short time oc
cupied by the board In the matter it was phy
sically Impoeelbli (01 It to make a proper In
vestigation.
The Board of Supervisors when fixing water
rates acts judicially, and where it has ox
ercised Its discretion in fixing: the rates it
cannot be compelled by mandamus to change
its Judgment or to take further action thereon.
It has been held that a writ of mandate must
be so fpeclfic, certain and definite that the de
fendant will not be required to look beyond the
writ to ascertain his duty.
How can. this court define In its mandate what
is a full investigation and what will be a fair
and reasonable rate?
This proceeding is baaed upon the theory that
the order eoniDlÃtned of Is absolutely void. I
am satisfied that however Inadequate may have
been the Investigation made by the defendant
and however unsatisfactory may have been
the evidence produced before it the order was
not void.
The board made some Investigation and heard
some evidence. It heard the statements of the
chief engineer of the water company and the
testimony of O. F. Allardt. What those state
ments and that testimony showed does not
appear. If It did tHe result would not be dif
ferent. The court has no power to give direc
tions to the board as to the evidence which it
should require or as to the conclusions which It
should draw therefrom.
In a case where the hoard netrlects to take
action In the matter of fixing water rates this
court has iiower to comnt-I It to do so. but It
cannot dictate to the board how it should act.
It appearing therefore that the defendant
has already adopted an order fixing water rates
for the next fiscal year, the demurrer of defend
ant to plaintiff's affidavit will be sustained and
the proceedings dismissed.
PAGE-BURLING WFDDING

The wedding of Dr. John Evelyn Page
of the United States ship Olympia and
Miss Mamie Burling, the- charming daugh
ter of A. M. Burling, will take place n^xt
Tuesday evening at the residence of the
brldÂ«\ 2020 Buchanan street. Dr. Page has
been ordered to Washington. D. C, and
the urgency of the order has hurried
preparations for the happy event. For
the same reason the ceremony will he
conducted very Quietly, none but mem
bers of Nic farr.ilv and a very few inti
mate friends bring present. This will
be ;il! the more regretted by local society,
as Miss Burling, by her many accomplish

deared herself to a very wide circle of
friends, who will, however, fully appre
ciate the romance of the situation. Dr.
Page, the fortunate groom, has also made
scores of friends even since his arrival
from Manila, and, nil in all, the event is
likely to prove a notable one In society

SUTHERLAND'S
NEMESIS SUED
FOR A DIVORCE
The Colonel Named
as Co-Respondent.
"ONRAD FECKER PLAINTIFF
A FEW ESCAPADES ARE CITEi)
IN THE COMPLAINT.
In the Meantime the Damage Suit for
Breach-of-Promise Seems to
Have Been Aban
doned.
The suit of Mrs. Jennie Webber, insti
tuted with the object in view of collect
ing some $20.000 damages from Colonel W.
J. Sutherland for breach <>f prom:
marriaee. experienced another painful
development yesterday in the tiling of a
divorce suit against the colonel's Norm -
sis. Conrad Fecker appears as plaintiff
in the action, and he asks for an ahso
lute divorce from his wife, whom he
states should bo known under her legal
name, Mrs. Amber J. Fecker. Plaintiff
state? that he married his wife last year
under the Dame Of Mrs. I'annnn, the cer< -
mony being performed at the Rus* Elousi
Since that time it is said that the charm
ing litigant has been known by the names
<<f Pecker, Cannon and Webber, it being
und< r the latter name that she gained the
favor of Colonel Suth.-rland.
In the complaint Fecker makes various
specific charges of adultery against his
wife, and .loins Colonel Sutherland in the
action as co-respondent. The various es
capades of Colonel Sutherland and Mrs.
Fecker are alleged to have taken place in
many well-known resorts, including the
Ocean View House, the Turkish Baths
and restaurants of fame. Through these
escapades Fecker sets forth that great
BC&ndal has been attached to his name.
and hence he prays relief.
Fecker's life has been an eventful one
since his marriage. Shortly after the per
formance of the ceremony he was shot
by Miss Holt, who will shortly stand trial
before Judge I.awlor for an assault to
murder. The case was called a few days
apo, hut was postponed through the ina
bility of the prosecution to locate the ob
ject "oi Miss Holt's wrath, but It seems
th.it he is now in a position to proceed
and doubtless the world will soon know
the motive that prompted the attempt
upon the unhappy husband's life.
In the meantime Mrs. "Webber's" suit
for breach of promise seems to have been
abandoned. Colonel Sutherland said that
such would be the outcome, though
doubtless he did not anticipate the de
velopment of yesterday.
A POET'S TRIBUTE.
The Author of "The Man With the
Hoe" Speaks Feelingly of a
Former Pupil.
Among the many letters of sympathy
received by Mr. and Mrs. A. L. Parish
from friends of their son. Linn Markley
Parish, who was killed by a fall into the
shaft of the Dutch mine a few days ago,
is one from Edwin Markham, the poet
and author of "The Man With the Hoe."
Mr. Markham writes as follows:
Dear Friends: 1 was shocked to bear of
Marl; lev's death. But we who sorrow over it
must not sorrow as those who have no hope.
The chances and changes of this world are hard
to understand, but we will hold to the faith
that all things are In grasp of a large Pur
pose that will bring them right at last. Mark
1. v was a generous, high-minded boy, and God
will have use for him in the great world to
which he had gone.
In this solemn moment let us rededlcate our
lives to unselfish and neighborly service that we
may meet our loved one some day in the king
dom of the Father. Faithfully yours.
EDWIN MARKHAM.
Poet Markham was a tutor of young
Farlsh in the Berkeley University, and he
formed a strong attachment for the boy.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW FORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May P.â The stock market to
day was demoralized by liquidation, i- th vol
untary and forced, and Milues melted away
with larte Interests apparently apalhotlc.
Marginal accounts were Wiped out. and nothing
escrfped the furious define. The continuance
of the bear pressure disheartened many and re-
BUlted in shakint cut many commission house
accounts. The market was devoid of general
new features, but local Btocka reflected fear as
tj the probable effect of the Ford franchise tax
bill, which It u.i the ceneral belle! would i,
signed to-morrow. London purchased some 30.
--000 sharf-s, rendering an easier tone to sterling
exchange and acting as the sustaining [actor
in the early dealings. Money on call was
.-trong. ramming from ;<>* to '. the latter being
the quotation of the la*t loan. Standard shares
were thrown over in s r >me instances to protect
specialties that were recedlntz at ;in alarming
rate. The forenoon show of strength tempted
a renewal of short pressure and liquidation,
which was practically continuous. Along the
we.ikes-t points were the flower stocks, which
had risen thÂ«; most during the long bull cam
paign. Brooklyn Transit suffering a net loss
of OV4. New York Airbrake 12Vj and People's
'â Â«-â¢ over - i Inta Othnr declines ainonx thÂ«
specialties were American Tobacco 14, Sugar
and Steel Hoop 6Â»i, .Metropolitan Street Hail
way 6. Continental Tobacco preferred -I-.., Man
hattan 4"-i, National Steel 4 and Consolidated
Gas 3. The railway share? suffered from 1 to
3 points lo.ss. and there were co many other
weak snots that their enumeration vv,,uld be
tedious. The bear faction was constantly on
tiÂ»f alert for vulnerable points and stop-loss
orJers were freely uncovered. In some quarters
the expectation was that the Government crop
report to be issued to-morrow would show little
improvement in the winter wheat condition.

opments at Pretoria produced a better tone, j

best, though there were losses on balance.
Silver closed strong at !7%d The bank bought
EH6.000 gold In bars.
The feature of the mining contango busi- i
ness to-day was the extreme difficulty expert- I
enced by bulls in copper to get commitments ;
carried over. The reason assigned by the j
principal dealers in American copper shares is
; that the market is unsettled, owing lo New i
Jersey combines that they fear the next set- |
; tlement will disclose a bear account, w'.ien â¢
most of the shares will have to be livered j
after all the trouble and expense of taking j

almost exhausted the market Is getting excited

HAY AND FEEDSTUFFS.
Receipts of Hay were light, being only 270 '
tons, hut the market declined 60c Just the j
same. If the present decline keeps up the new j
crop will have to be sacrificed at prices below ;
cost of production, which will be bad for the i
industry. Dealers say there is no cause for the j
decline, as the crop Is not looking as well as it
did a month ago. and the yield bids fair to be
less than expected. All of which does not stop
the market from going down right along.

Th..m:i< Tierney and his wife, Lixzie,
an the heart-stricken parents who were
made childless by the awful tragedy "t

find themselves bereft of th>-ir littl â¢â¢
with appalling suddenness, and not even
the gentle ministrations of sympal
relatl . friends can do aught to as
grief that ov< rwhelms them.
Mr. Tierney was until the recent
closing i Â»f tli'- [ngleside Coursing 1.-irk
if th<' attaches of the park; and Bince
then he has been employed in training
James O'Donnell's greyhounds. At 7:15

had c mpleted half the journey
when a scream from the kitchen Btartled
both husband and wife, and as they.
* turned their eyes upward a Bheet of flame
lighted up th<- kitchen. Realizing in an I
â  Instant the danger that threatened their
i child, they rushed to its rescue. Tierney
was the first to reach the blazing kitch< n.
and the sight that met his gaze almost
froze his blood with horror. The baby's
chair whs completely enveloped In flames
and the littlo hamis were beating feebly
at them as though In an effort to ex- 1
tinguish them. The father seized the
blazing form of his child from the chair
and. rushing to the sink, with mistaken
zeal turned the water on it to put out
the fire. His own clothes caught lire,
but h< paid nn heed, Catching the child
in his arms again, lie tore from the house
and dashed through the streets to the
office of Dr. Lagan, at the corner of
Twenty-second and Folsom streets, three
blocks away. Passers-by in the neighbor
hood of the doctor's office were attract* i
by the appearance of a man minus his
coat and hat, with his hair dish'
Ing up the street with the speed of
the wind, in the gathering twilight they
could indistinctly see that ho held some
thing In his hands, but It was not until
almost at the door of the doctor's office
thit they realized the meaning of the
apparition. Then several men ran from
the sidewalk and assisted the reeling and
exhausted father into TL V. Wynnes
drugstore and thence upstairs to the
doctor's office. The physician did every
thli k medical science could suggest to
I relieve the little one, but with its hair
burned from Its head, the skin of Its lit tie
body blackened and seared by the flames
Â,.,]' |tfl eyes literally cooked In their
sockets its death could only be a question
Of time Soothing lotions were applied
to the burns and the child was removed
to Its home, where death, ensued at 11:40
After caring for the infant the doctor
turned his attention to the father,
who' was frightfully burned. His hands
wi re covered with huge blisters and
burned as though with hot irons. The
Injured members wore dressed and Tier
ney was placed In bed. where he passed
a sleepless night, despite the drugs admin
istered to produce sleep, moaning and
calling upon those present to save
i "Billy," ;Â»s the baby had been affection
ately named. The are is supposed to have
been caused by the explosion of the lamp.
Until Mr. and Mrs. Tierney say there was
no cloth on the kitchen table on which the
lamp stood by which the baby could have
pulled it over on him, and, furthermore,
they say the baby's chair was several feet
fruin the table at the time of the accident.
All yesterday the house of mourning
was thronged by sympathisers, whose
hushed voices sought to comfort the
childless couple. Time may do what they
could notâ bring resignation to the inevlt
table, but it can never efface thy terrible
â  Indelibly stamped on the bruins of
th< parents.
The funeral will take place from the
house this morning at 11 o'clock, Rev.
Father Mac Donald officiating. The In
terment will be in Holy Cross Cemetery.
Mr. Tierney has hosts of friends among
the patrons of the coursing parks, who
admire him for his many sterling quali
ties, and his heroic efforts to save the life
of his baby boy will draw from them
increased admiration and sympathy.
FOSTER PERJURY CASE.
An Apparent Scheme Not to Prose-
cute Is Squelched by Judge
Mogan.
The case of Fred Foster, the horseman,
rhnrged with perjury, was called in Judge
Mogan's court yesterday morning for pre
liminary examination. Attorney Sweeney
appeared for the prosecution and asked
for another continuance, remarking that
there was not much in the case. The
Judge said there was just as much In
the case now as there was at the time
the warrant was sworn out, and it would
: â  go on. He granted a continuance
till 2 o'clock.
At 2 o'clock Attorney Dunne appeared
for the prosecution and asked for a con
tinuance, as Judge Conlan, a material
witness, had not been subpenaed. After
discussion the case was continued till this
morning.
There is a rumor afloat that Foster and
A. Howard, the Australian plunger, have
settled their differences and the cases will
not bf prosecuted on either side. This
was denied by Howard's attorney.

THE PROBLEM SOLVED.
THE NEW MEDICAL DISCOVERY
TESTED.
Results of the Test in Various Forms
of Dyspepsia.
Chronic indigestion or dyspepsia,
while a. very common trouble, has *f or
Borne time been looked upon by able
physicians as a very serious thing, and
that no time should bo lost in treating
it properly at the start, because recent
researches have shown that the most
Berious, fatal ami incurable diseases
have their origin in Simple dyspepsia
or Indigestion.
Diabetes is simply one form of indi-
gestion, the sugar and starchy food not
â  being assimilated by tin- digestive or-
gans. In Bright's disease the albumen
is not properly assimilated.
While consumptii n and dyspepsia
are twin diseases it is beyond question
that dyspepsia makes a fertile soil for
the seeds <>f consumption.
Hut the tnmble has been to find a
remedy that could be depended upon to
cure dyspepsia, as it is notoriously ob-
stinate and difficult to cure.
This has been the question which
has puz/.ied physicians and dyspeptics
alike, until the question was solved
three years ago by the appearance of
the new dyspepsia cure In the medical
world known as Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets, which It was claimed was a
certain reliable cure for every form of
stomach trouble.
Physicians, however, would not ac-
i cept such statements without first glv-
; ing the new remedy many tests and
carefully observing results.
For three years the remedy has been
thoroughly tested in every section of
the country and with surprising and
satisfactory results.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can hon-
estly be claimed to be a specific, a radi-
cal, lasting cure for indigestion in the
various forms of acid dyspepsia or sour
stomach, gas or wind on the stomach,
too much bile, undue fullness or depres-
sion after eating and similar Bymptoms
resulting from disordered digestion.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets were not
placed before the public until this
three years' trial left no doubt as to
their value and they have recently been
placed in the trade and can befound
at all druggists at the nominal price of
50 cents per package.
No false claims are made for the
remedy. It. will not cure rheumatism,
pneumonia, typhoid fever nor anything
but just what it is claimed to cure and
that is every form of stomach .trouble.
No dieting is necessary, good whole-
some food and plenty of it and you may
rest assured that Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets will digest it.
Druirnists claim for it that it is a
pleasure to recommend it to dyspeptics,
because it gives such universal satis-
faction.

and conservative,
A thorough examination of these properties has been made by Mr. Robert
Shaw of Chicago, who has been for many years in the Biscuit Business, who
certifies that they are valuable and well adapted to the business. An expert
accountant engaged by the organizers of the new corporation certifies, after a
thorough examination of the accounts for a period of years, that the earnings of
the various companies operated separately have made for a number of years
past, in spite of the severe competition which has existed among them, a net
average annual profit of $205,000 per annum and that a conservative estimate of
the earnings of the company after consolidation would be in excess of $400,000
without raising the price of standard goods to the consumer.

T per cenl are payable seml-annually. It has full voting power and together with

WATER FRONT
OFFICIALS ARE
NEATLY BUNKOED
Taken in by a Young
Swindler.
HE FOUND IT EASY WORK
A HARBOR COMMISSIONER OR
TWO ON HIS LIST.
Was About to Try His Tale of Woe
on Herold When Former Vic
tims Set the Police on
His Trail.
A modern St. Paul has been paying
visits recently to the offices of the Harbor
Commission. He is all â¢ ings to all men,
Inn .... their debtor. To Chief
Engineer Holmes he introduced himself
ns Edward Holmes; to Secretary English,
who loosened up like, the political sailor
he is, the young man was [ward Eng
lish, and to Commissioner Colnon'. who
ear.not break himself of the habit of
dropping In at the ferry building, he was
Edward Colnon. It was only when he
bucked up against Commissioner llerold,
who is .suspicious' of strangers since
"Chad" began laying for his wig, that
he came to grief. The same jealousy with
which the newest Commissioner guards
his seat characterizes his attitude to
â ward any one attempting graft on the
llerold tree.
Five men; who could .... on
any consideration to lake bad money,
parted with their proud coin to the young
man of many aliases. In addition to the
victims named there were two moreâ
Major Harney, the Democratic watcn
dog of the water front, an<l ex-Secretary
Kei-gan. Each yielded $3 75 to Edward
â \Vhuever-lie-Was before his game ended,
and Colnon, who thought he could de
tect a family likeness in the foot of the
young man, thrvw In a year'- subscrip
tion to the Stockton Mail as laghiappe.
The young: swindler used very little bait
to lure tils victims. Using the surname
of the intended victim, but disclaiming
any relationshipâ probably from scorn of
kin with such a jjood thingâ the young
man began a short tale of woe. He had
been injured in a premature blast in a
mine and had come to San Francisco for
medical attendance. As proof of his story
he showed a scar on the top of his head.
"Would the other make a loan of $3 75, just
sufficient to enable the visitor to reach
home? The other invariably did until he
happened to be Commissioner i [erold, and
then he didn't.

SECRET OF FLAGMAN
LEVY OUT AT LAST
SURMISES CREATED BY HIS
WILL ARE CLEARED UP.
Oakland Francisco ("all,
Broadway, May 9
When John Levy, the eccentric flagman,
for many years at Twelfth and
Webster streets, died last January, leav
ing li ted in a banh to his n
in Ireland. It was not known here thai
he bad a wife and daughter living, but
: â  '-r<n has just leaki -i out.
Levy's will, when died for probate sev
eral months ago t.y Attorney Bernard
I HUNTING A DEAD
I WOMAN'S GOLD
'* /\ AKLAND, May 9.-Barely had aped Mrs. Mary Hamilton breathed
. I 1 ! U ' r v. a t ' ll3 . mnrnl "X When a number of neighbors be K an to ransack
' 1 Â» h p home for $2000 it was believed she had concealed. Mrs. Hamilton
'. V-T Hved at 62 Second street. During the closing days of her life J. L
SJ Jamieson and her daughter resided with her. To them she confided
â¦ the story that she had saved $2000 and had it hidden somewhere in tho house
15 Bhe declined to reveal its hiding place. As soon as it was known that she
â¦ ras dead people rushed in and began to ransack the house. In a few minutes
Â« everything was torn up and every corner searched. Jamieson was forced to
-, Bend for the police to prevent the treasure-hunters from tearing tho walls
X down. No money has yet been found.
A
MeFadden. who is named as executor,
caused considerable comment. The in
strument provided that if any woman
claiming to be his widow should come
forward and establish her claim in court
she should take $1; also any woman
claiming to be his daughter and estab
lishing the same should take but $1.
These clauses set people to wondering,
and certain ones feeling interested went
to work to ascertain if Levy did leave a
wife and daughter. Their efforts have
now been rewarded, fur it has been
learned diat Mrs. Levy, the widow, re
sides in Sydney, Australia, and slip has
sent a power or attor:.*r* to a friend in
this city to look nfter her interests. The
daughter, now married, resides in lie
land. As a consequence the $5000 will be
fought for, and Attorneys Snook &
Church are preparing papers for a con
test.
It Is calmed that Levy's intentions to
cut off hie wife and daughter by will are
thwarted by the California laws relating
to community property, and if the located
widow and daughter can prove their re
lationship they will be entitled to a good
ly portion of the wealth.
'it develops now that the eccentric flag
man had been estranged from his family
for very many years.
WHOLE GARDENS STOLEN.
Enterprising Thief Steals a Wagon
Load of Shrubs and Flowers.
ALAMEDA, May 9.â An enterprising
thief with decidedly original methods
stole enough flowers and shrubbery a few
nights ago from the gardens along Verdi
street to start a well-stocked nursery.
The thief or thieves evidently went about
their mission with an express wagon, for
they got away with more etuff than a i
score of men could have carried. Whole
â  is were stripped of every vestige of ,
r tr shrub nnci left as bare as a
l field. Valuable shade trees were
uprooted and carted off. From the home
oi .Mrs. J. F. Spranger. 1555 Verdi Street,
were taken two huge garden vases
with the large palms growing in them.
They were very heavy and could not have !
moved by less than two or three J
men. The police have been unable to I
. or.y clew to the disposition of the j
Bower gardens.

IS THE HOODOO
EXERTING ITS
EVIL INFLUENCE?
Held Responsible for
the "Sink."
ROADBED VANISHES AGAIN
RAILS AND TIES ARE SUS
PENDED IN SPACE.
Engine No. 19 Passed Over the
Treacherous Spot Just Pre
vious to the Recent
Accident.
AI.AMEDA, May 9.â The railroad men
of the narrow-gauge line are wondering
If "hoodoo" engine 19 Is exerting its evil
influence In the vicinity of the "sink."
About two weeks ago the "hoodoo" was
taken to Newark to undergo repairs. It
passed over the "sink." Fifteen minutes
later ninety feet of the roadbed went
down out of sight, leaving the rails and
ties suspended in space. A serious acci
dent to the Los Gatos train was only
averted by the vigilance of the engineer,
who stopped his engine just as the for
ward trucks rolled on the treacherous
tracks.
"Hoodoo" 19 came back over the line
last Sunday morning and immediately the
"sink" swallowed another stretch of the
j newly made roadbed, and travel over the
! line had to be suspended for nearly the
â whole day.
To-day the "hoodoo" was put on the
Alamedu local lino running within half a
mile of the spot that has caused the rail
road people so much trouble. The evil
engine had barely completed Its first trip
this morning when a trackwalker . came
into town on a run with the announce
ment that "the 'sink' has sunk again."
: Incoming trains were notified in time to
i prevent a disaster.
The roadbed had dropped six or eight
! feet into the mire for a distance of nearly
I a hundred feet. The material devoured
by the greedy sink was the name that was
put In Sunday. A large gang of men was
â  put to work repairing the damage. Crib
bing of heavy timbers was built under
the suspended rails, and by noon time
: through trains were allowed to pass over
' the place. Roadmaster Baxter is having
| the ".sink" filled with cinders'. He argues
j that it is lighter material than has hlther
: to been used on the "sink." and conse
> quently will not sink so readily.
He advanc< s no theory as to the repeat
ed disappearance of the roadtjed, but the
' trainmen are firmly convinced that the
i "hoodoo" engine has something to do with
it- _

INGLESIDE GAMBLERS
ARE AGAIN DEFEATED
Validity of the Anti-Bookmaking
Ordinance Unquestioned.
Judge Murasky Renders an Important Decision Defining
How the Police Must Enforce the Lawâ The
Groezinger Farce Concluded.
cpy? NOTHER and a signal triumph
//\ has been won in the struggle
/ \ to banish from this city the
& V" gambling blacklegs and cor
rupting Influences of the poolrooms and
of the race track. Superior Judge Frank
J. Murasky has rendered his opinion in
the injunction suit instituted by the
Parr Coast Jockey Club to restrain
the Chief of Police from entering the
racecourse In'closure -it Ingleside. In
his opinion Judge Murasky decides that
the Chief of Police, in the performance
of his duties, lias the right to enter
Ingle track and to arrest all
who may be there committing an of
fense against the laws. The gamblers
have been battling for almost two
months to destroy the ordinance pro
hibiting bookmaking and they have
gained nothing. The constitutionality
of the ordinance is still unquestioned,
As far as the decision of any court of
competent jurisdiction is concerned the
prohibitory ordinance stands as a law
of Pan Francisco and will be enforced,
as it Is believed that there is only one
Groezing^r on the inferior bench and
he fortunately holds his position hut
for a short time through an accident
of illness to its rightful occupant.

â with or without the permission of the

arr--- 1 ghl violating the
ordinance which prohibits bookmaking.
Forcible entry alone is .-njoined by the
decision of Judg^ Murasky.
This means that in his former effort?
to enforce with energy the prohibitory
ordinance the Chief of Police simply
undertook to do the work the wrong
way. A i any time the policp may arm
themselves with "John Doe" warrants,
go to tli.- racetrack, pay their admis
sion and arrest any one encaged in
gambling on th^ races. The offenders
and the evidence can be captured at the
same time and The prohibitory ordi
nance will not be ii! the slightest degree
Injun
Then- is no likelihood that the gamb
lers of Ingleside will attempt to oper
ate this s.-ason so th--re is every reason
the great fight against
a monstrous evil has been won until
next November at least.
While Judge Murasky's decision has
no effect upon the legality or the con
stitutionality of the anti-bookmaking
law, it has a very important bearing
upon the efforts of the police to sup
press another local evil. Unless Judge
Murasky's decision is appealed the
police can make no more forcible en
tries into Chinese gambling dens. This
effect of the decision will seriously In
terfere with police work in the Chinese
quarter, as raids upon the gambling
dens are difficult of success even under
existing conditions. ,
Judge Murasky's decision is of such
general Importance that it is given in
full as follows:

selling, and permitted nthor forms of
ng. upon Its racecourse, and as
a consequence was not entitled to re
. this action from a court of
equity. The fact being in doubt, the
injunction theretofore Issued at the re
quest of plaintiff was dissolved until a
trial could be had.
That a suitor in a court of equity
must enter with "clean hands," ana
that he must show irreparable dam
age are primary rules of equity. One
who is committing a public offense
within a house or other lnclosure can
-7.1 t procure an injunction to restrain
officers from entering his house
to arrest him. though their method of
tntfriiiK may not be authorized by
law; nor may one who is fostering
and protecting criminals within his
dwelling, or upon his premises, ask a
court of equity to stay the breaking
in of the police, even though such
mode of entry be in excess of their
It gal power.
The trial of thf case, occupying
eleven days, -was devoted mainly to the
d<t> rmination of the good faith of the
plaintiff.
The ordinance prohibiting hookmak
ing and wagering upon horse nnd dog
races was passed March 13. 1SP!Â». The
answer of defendants alleges "that up
t<> the 12th .lay of March. 1899, plain
titff conducted its race meetings In a
quiet and orderly manner at its race
track." but that after said date it
"conducted the same in violation of
law. and particularly in violation of
order No. 174 (second scrlosi passed by
the Roard of Supervisors of the city
and county of San Francisco." It is
also alleged that plaintiff sold to
divers persons the "privilege of sell
iner pools upon races by horses upon
Bald track, and making books and b> ts
ami wagers upon such horses con
testing or to contest upon said track."
The evidence shows that on the day
after the passage of the ordinance the
plaintiff canceled the bonkmakinsr and
pool-selling privileges upon Its track,
returned the purchase money of such
privileges to the purchasers, and has
not since then sold any of such prlvi
â¢r licensed the making of books
or Belling of pools upon its premls. s.
It would be sufficient for the purposes
of defendants' case to show that plain
tiff permitted a violation of the ordl
nance; hut in the thousand pages of
testimony there is absolutely nothing
which proves the making of books or
wagers upon the premises of plaintiff
the 14th day of March. 1899. Sev
eral arrests were made by the police
on the 14th. l",th and 16th days of
March; but, except in the cases of
those arrested on the 14th. the testi
mony is entirely insufficient to estab
lish any guilty act by the parti. s nr
rested; and as to the acts committed
on the 14th. the evidence is not entire
ly satlsfat tory. But even if there
were some ilk-gal acts committed. It
must appear that such acts were com
mitted with the permission or upon the
sufferance of the olaintiff before it
can be. charged with had faith.
On the other hand, it affirmatively
appears that at the time of filing its
bill in equity the plaintiff had ob-
Berved the law. Its directors have p;g
nified their intention to respect it. and
its manager, to whom by resolution of
it? board of directors is entrusted the
authority to prant, refuse and with
draw privileges and licenses upon the
racecourse, testified that no bookmak
ing. pool-selling or other form of
wagering would he permitted or su'f
f< red upon the premises of plaintiff
while the law existed.
The charge that a suitor in equity Is
not pure of conscience concerning the
matter in dispute must be proved be
fore he can be expelled from court,
and that proof is- wanting in this case.
Though it is a matter of common
knowledge that gambling is an inci
dent of racing as carried on in this
State, the court cannot indulge, in the
presumption that it is a necessary In
cident; nor can the court presume that
because the plaintiff conducts races it
will violate the .>rder of the Board of
Supervisors prohibiting wagering.
The good faith of plaintiff respecting
th.- ordinance having been established,
it is entitled to enter this court and
pray for relief.
Being in court, plaintiff complains
that defendants, In violation of law
and against Uie will of plaintiff, en
tered its pp niises and threaten to
continue so to do; and that such en
try has caused plaintiff irreparable in
jury.
It appears that upon some of the
days mentioned in the complaint de
fendants entered in opposition to the
wish of plaintiff, without any warrant
or other process of law, and upon one
day they prepared to break ppen the
gates with an ax. The answer asserts
that they will continue to enter as they
have entered and for the same pur
poses.
The proof is sufficient to show the
damage to be irreparable in its nature.
The defendants are peace officers ami
cannot be restrained from performing
their duties; they have a right to enter
th.- premise? of plaintiff without its
consent In the performance of their
dutie* arid in the manner provided by
law. but not otherwise.
Counsel for plaintiff vigorously at
tacked the validity of order No. 174,
known as the "anti-bookmaking ordi
nance," upon the ground that no com
petent proof of its passage was ad
duced; hut the determination of that
question not being necessary in the de
termination of the cause the ordinance
should not be questioned in this deci
sion.
Tho defendants are, therefore, re
strained from entering the- premises of
plaintiff without its consc-nt, except
in the manner provided by law, and
while engaged in the performance of
their duties as police officers of the
city and county of San Francisco.
Let findings be prepared accordingly
and judgment be entered in favor of
plaintiff for permanent injunction in
accordance herewith and for costs
Dated May 9. 1899.
FRANK J. MURASKY, Judgo.
Another phase of the fight to destroy
the traffic of the gamblers was dis
played in the Police Court, where Jus
tice of the Peace Groezinger presides.
Groezinger did as was expected of him
and dismissed the cases of the other
horse gamblers. The Justice declared
that he had read the anti-bookmaking
ordinance during the night and had
convinced himself .that it was unconsti
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, MAY 10, 1899,
tutional, a rather startling admission
that on the day before he had acted
from some motive other than convic
tion.
It is fortunate, however, that the evil
of Groezingcr's action is only tempo
rary. He has simply saved a few gam
blers from a small punishment, and
when Judge Treadwell is able to resume
his duties will go down to his own
court. His absurd arrogance in assum
ing to pass judgment upon the consti
tutionality of the ordinance is not con- j
Bidered except as a joke. It is perhaps I
unfortunate that the regularly elected
Police Judges, Mogan and Conlan,
should have transferred all the book
making cases to Groezinger, but it ha 3
been suggested that there will be an
election this year, and while Groezinger
will not be an aspirant for public favor,
Mogan and Conlan will. Under section
2, chapter 2, of the charter it is provided
that Justices of the Peace will hold
office until January 1, 1901. This may
account for the transfer of the cases.
As was anticipated, Groezinger yes
terday morning dismissed all the other
cases, thirty-one in number, of book
makers and others arrested at the Ingle
side racetrack for violating the new
ordinance against poolselling. They in
cluded the remaining nineteen cases
that were originally on Judge Mogan's
calendar and twelve cases that were
on Judge Conlan's calendar, but which
Groezinger had also agreed to try.
Prosecuting: Attorney Carpenter
fought against the dismissal of the
cases, pointing: out that they were not
upon that morning's calendar and on
other grounds, but his objections had
no effect upon the acting Judge. Car
penter then consulted rhief Lees and
it was a.greed that an appeal on each
case should be taken to the Superior
Court, and Carpenter gave notice to
that effect in court.
When the cases were called Attorney
Ach said that a motion to dismiss had
been taken under advisement, and Car
penter asked what motion. Ach replied
the motion in regard to the racetrack
cases and he read the names of the de
fendants. Carpenter replied that no
such cases were on that morning's cal
endar and he asked permission to pro
ceed with his calendar. Ach replied
that the cases were on Monday's calen
dar.
"There were no such cases on the cal
endar yesterday," said Carpenter. "The
prosecution in these cases has set them
for trial on different days and I insist
on taking them up as they come. I will
state now that there is sufficient evi
dence to convict in each case and the
prosecution is ready for trial."
"A motion to dismiss," said Aeh, "is
always in order. The motion was made
yesterday without objection. This mat
ter was submitted to your Honor, argu
ment was made and while some news
papers have, at least one of them "
The Judge interrupted him with the
remark: "It don't affect me at all."
"I wish to say." said Carpenter, 'â¢that
the newspapers are not trying this case.
These cases are not at this time before
the court and I insist upon them being
taken up in their regular order. There
must be sum." regularity in th<' pro
< eedings in this court, as in every court,
and I see no reason why these cases
should be taken out of their order and
a motion made to dismiss them. How
can the court or counsel know what
the evidence is to be and upon what can
the court base its action at this time
in entertaining such a motion for dis
missal simply at the request of the de
fendant's attorney without any show
ing whatever."
Ach contended that It had been the
practice in the courts ever since their
organization for motions to dismiss al
ways to be in order in any court where
cases were pending, and he was really
surprised at the way counsel was pro
ceeding and he could not see why he
did it.
"I will say," said the Judge, "that
since yesterday I took the pains to look
up this law myselfâ this particular or
der of the Board of Supervisors "
â¢'arpontor interrupted him by asking:
"Will your Honor permit me to say an
other word? The law under which
th- se cases are being prosecuted has
been heard and argued in the Superior
Court before one of the Judges and the
question as to the validity of the ordi
nance is now pending. The decision
may be expected at any time. If ad
verse to the prosecution dismissal will
necessarily follow. No hardships can
be worked upon the defendants by the
cases taking their regular course and â¢
no reason has been shown here why,
like any other case upon the calendar, ;
they should not take their regular j
course."
"I trust your Honor," said Ach, ''after
having heard the arguments and looked
up the law yourself, will assume
the responsibilities of your own
position and decide according to
your own judgment as the matter really
is. The matter up above is a suit for j .
an injunction, which can be decided by
his Honor Judge Murasky without
passing upon these propositions so far
as the ordinance is concerned, and, in
addition. Judge Murasky announced
from the bench during the argument
that he could see the very serious ob
jections I had advanced against the
order and did not see that it was neces- '
sary for him to decide it in order to
decide the case."
"It will be time enough," replied Car
penter, "for the court to assume its re
sponsibilities when the facts and cir
cumstances of the exigencies of the case ,
present themselves. There is nothing '
that the court can act upon."
"I will say this," said the Judge. "My
mind is fully made up about these
cases. I have got the courage of my
convictions and I am going to decide
the cases as I think is right and under
the law. Irrespective of any comment
from any newspaper whatsoever. It
cuts no figure with me. If I think I am
right I am going to decide the cases.
The decision I gave when I said the
ordinance was invalidly passed. I am
satisfied that judgment will be upheld
by any rourt and by any Judge. There
is absolutely no question in my mind
at this time that that ordinance is ab
solutely not worth the paper it is writ
ten upon. The defendants are all
charged under this order; the order be
ing invalid I will dismiss all the cases
and all of them will be stricken off the
calendar. Those are my convictions,
and I decide the cases according to
them and according to no newspaper
influence or the suggestion of any peo
ple on the outside. That is my order
and that Is my judgment."
Ach then asked if all the bonds were
exonerated, and the Judge replied in the
affirmative, adding, "If the prosecution
wants to appeal," but he got no fur
ther, as Prosecuting Attorney Carpen
ter interrupted him by saying, "I should
like to save an exception at this time
to the order of the court."
Attorney Ach then patted the Judge
on the back by saying: "It will sooner
or later be the rule in this community
that newspapers and the .public j&t (
large will laud Judges who have the
courage to decide according to the law
and according to their convictions."
Later Prosecuting Attorney Carpen
ter notified the Judge that appeals
would be taken in all the cases to the
Superior Court.
If anything were needed to establish
fully the perfect regularity of the pro
ceedings by which the anti-bookmaking
ordinance was adopted by the Board of
Supervisors the following statement
from John Russell will supply what is
lacking:
Tn the accounts published relative to
the order prohibiting poolpffling. and
as to Its passage by the Board of Su
porvisors, and the minutes of said
board, I simply desire to state:
Firstâ That the minutes of the
Board of Supervisors are not rontain
ed in one book, but are contained in
several volumes.
Secondâ That as clerk of the Board
of Supervisors, having the official rec
ords in my possession, 1 am under the
law qualified to testify as to those
records and to designate what they re
spectively contain.
Thirdâ That th^se reoords embrace:
"A"â The original order prohibiting
poolselling as amended and passed to
print.
"B"â The order as finally passed
and approved by hi* FTnnor the Mayor.
"C" â The written minutes of the
board show on the respective dates,
as in all legislative bodies, that this
order was introduced, amended and
passed to print on March rf. I*9o. and
taken up and finally passed and ap
proved by his Honor James D. Phelan,
Mayor, on March 13, 1899.
"D"â That tho printed minutes of the
Board of Supervisors in a separate
book show each order, resolution or
authorization in full as passed for
printing by the Board of Supervisors.
"E"â That the printed minutes of the
Board of Supervisors show in a. sepa
rate book each order in full passed by
the Board of Supervisors and ap
proved by the Mayor.
Further, that as Clerk, that I never
testified to altering the minutes of the
Board of Supervisors in any manner
whatever, or that the record was mu
tilated after the order wa-s passed.
What I did testify to, was. that as
Clerk of the board, within a period of
two weeks last past, and which I had
and have a perfect legal right to do,
certified on the book containing the
printed record, the following:
"Minutes of the Board of Supervis

record, the reason for this action was.
that In a ease in the Superior Court
before the Hon. Judge Murasky. the
counsel in the case objected to my
testimony, as to what the records
were, and what they contained, on the
ground that it was my personal opin
ion, and was not the best evidence as
to the records of the Hoard of Super
visors in my care and custody, stat
ing that the printed record was sim
ply newspaper clippings, and that
there was nothing In the book pre
sented to show what it was; my testi
mony as to what' the book was being
objected to.
In order to prevent this technical
objection being made. I inserted the
certificate (having the legal right to do
sn at any time), although the point
made was not material, as my testi
mony as to what the book was. and
what it contained was. or ought to be
all sufficient as to the records, being
their legal custodian.
The minutes of the Board of Super
visors of each meeting, either written
or printed, are written up and printed

denced in the procedure of all legisla
tive bodies. JN T O. A. RUSSELL.

Why Not Take a Trip to Europe?
The low rates for passage now In force by
the Anchor Line bring a European trip within
the roach of the most economical pleasure
seeker, and at less expense, than the coat of

The accommodations and comforts provided
on all steamships of the Anchor Line are unsur
passed and the well-maintained record for
safety has won for it the reputation of "Old
Reliable." The route taken by the Anchor Line

Thp above was unanimously adopted by
the State Board of Trade yesterday after
noon and voices tlie sentiment of every
man, woman and child In the State.
During the meeting, Colonel John P.
IriPh. who presided, railed the attpntinn
of the members to the reports that Ad
miral Dewey might return home by way
of the Suez canal and land in New York,
and spoke of the steps taken by the
Chamber of Commerce to extend an in
vitation to the admiral to rome here.
Craigie Sharp then offered the above
and It was unanimously carried.
Professor Jaffa of the State Universitj
appeared before the meeting and asked
for assistance in entertaining the dele
gates to the convention of the American
Agricultural Association that meets here
July 5, 6 and 7. Secretary of Agriculture
Wilson is expected to be in attendance
and the delegates include the dost prom
inent agricultural and horticultural ex~
perts In the country. Jt was stated that
the railroad had offered exceptional fa
cilities for the delegates to visit the va
rious sections of the State in order to
familiarize themselves with its soil and
resources. The board instructed the man
ager to render whatever assistance lay in
his power.
W. H. Mills spoke at length on the dif
ficulties in the way of making a proper
representation at the Paris Exposition
California's exhibits, he said, must go | n
with those fn>m other States in the space
allotted to the United States. California
minerals would be placed with the min
erals from Colorado, Nevada. Arizona
Montana and other States in one general
exhibit of the mineral resources of the
country. The entire space allotted for the
mineral exhibit would hardly hold the
display in the State mining bureau So
it would be with California fruits ce
reals, wines and other products Visi
tors would merely see in them products
from the United States and would not
know from what part of the country they
came.
It was decided to notify the f'nmmls
sioners to Paris that they would receive
the hearty co-operation of the boardl It
was also decided to notify the Commis
sioners that if they establish a bureau
of information the board will assist
them.

At a meeting of the directors of the

ter of inviting Admiral Dewey to return

being an admiral, baa the privilege of
choosing his own route. The impression
seemed to be that the admiral is the one
to make the proposition to, and this will
be done.
Secretary Scott was directed to prepare
a letter to Admiral Dewey, which will be
forwarded on the next steamer to the
Orient. The letter will be a simple hut
strong recitation of the feeling of admira
tion that exists for the officer whom San
Francisco seeks to have for a guest.
About a year ago, during the Spanish
war. there was a grave feeling of uncer
tainty among shipping men and others
all along this coast, and partlcularlj in
this city, over the presence in the Pacific
of the Spanish fleet. It was to Dewey
that the people looked for protection, and
their confidence in his ability was real
ized. The citizens of the city and the
people of the entire coast wish to have the
naval hero make his home-coming this
way in order that they may express their
appreciation of what he has done for
them.
A letter expressive of these sentiments
will be prepared by Secretary Scott at
once and forwarded to Admiral Dewey.
If he consents to change his route and
come by way of this city he is sure of
receiving an ovation uriequaled in the
history of this city.

WILLIE HALE
MASTERING THE
FRENCH TONGUE
Expects to Be Paris
Commissioner.
Warden Hale of Ran Quentin Prison has
received another gold brick. It is nothing
new for Mr. Hale to be handed one of
these deceptive articles, as was instanced
in the case of "Doctor" Cooper, but the
present case is. especially noteworthy In
view of the fact that this brick is of
Mexican manufacture and was donated by
Governor Gage, with the result that HalÂ«
I has resigned his position at San Quentln
and is traveling the thorny path of
French grammar in the hope of being ap
pointed commissioner to the Paris expo
sition. So quickly did the Warden grab
at the bait that the Board of Prison Di
! rectors will have to meet next Friday
and elect Aguirre to fill the vacancy a
month sooner than was expected.
Tli.- story of â¢'Willie" Hale studying
' French has been going the rounds of
street and club conversation for several
days and Gage himself is said to think
it the best joke of his mcumbei It was
