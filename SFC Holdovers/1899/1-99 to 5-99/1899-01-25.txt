SOON TO BE
ASSERTED
President Will Ta^e Firn)
Action Regarding
Philippines.
AguiQaldo's Followers to Be
Subdued, "Peaceably, if
Possible; F orei bly,
if Necessary."
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.â The Herald's Washington correspondent sends
the following: The assertion of the sovereignty of the United States
over the Philippines may be precipitated not only by the political
crisis in the archipelago, but by the necessity of occupying Iloilo on
account of the da ""â¢â "â  nf epidemic disease resulting from the re
tention of General Miller's army on board the transports. It developed to
day that the President feels he cannot wait much longer upon the Senate.
Unless that body should shortly ratify the treaty there is reason to believe
instructions will be sent to Admiral Dewey and General Otis either to with
draw Miller's expedition or to assert the supremacy of the United States,
peaceably if possible, forcibly if necessary.
There are three factors in the Philippine situation which are forc
ing the Administration to action: First â Aguinaldo's hostile attitude
and the constant growth of his army. Second â The danger of smallpooc
on board the transports which are the prisons of Miller's expedition to
Iloilo; third, the danger of recognition of the Philippine republic by
foreign governments, especially Germany and Spain.
There is no longer any concealment in administration circles of the criti
cal condition of affairs in the archipelago. General Otis' reports are far
from being as encouraging as the administration was at first willing to
have the public believe, and describe the menacing attitude which Aguin
aldo and his followers have assumed.
Worse than this is his expressed fear that an epidemic will break out
among the troops in Miller's command. Already a number of cases
have appeared, the result of cooping men up on ships in such a hot
climate. There are 3400 men on these ships. The report that they have
beon landed is untrue. All that General Miller is able to do is to land- men in
Finn 11 squads, who after a little exercise, hardly enough to stretch their
le^s. are compelled to return to their ships. They cannot go far from
shore because of the danger of conflict with the natives.
The President's instructions require that a clash be avoided at ail
instructions were sent on January 2, and were due to the
President's belief that he should take no action until the treaty of peace is
1. He places the blame for sickness among the troops as well as for
the development of Aguinaldoism directly at the doors of the Senators who
have fought the ratification of the treaty. So long as the United States is
divided on the question of the acquisition of the Philippines, just so long,
he feels, will the Filipinos continue their present tactics, and the result will
be if there should be greater delay that Aguinaldo may even after such rati
fication decline to recognize the sovereignty of the United States and precipi
tate a conflict.
It may, therefore, be stated that the President does not want the treaty
to go over for consideration at an extra session. He wants ratification,
and he wants it now.

TRAGEDY ON THE
BALDWIN RANCH
Negro Commits Murder
and Suicide.
STRANGLES HIS YOUNG SON
PLUNGES WITH THE BODY
INTO A RESERVOIR.
"Lucky" Baldwin the Foreman of
the Coroner's Jury That
Conducts an Investi
gation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 24.â Details of
a murde- and suicide on the ranch of
E. J. (Lucky) Baldwin at Arcadia
reached Los Angeles to-day. Baldwin
has had in his employ for a short time
Lafayette Ditty as cook. Ditty, who is
a negro and resided with his wife,
Emily, and son, Christian, on the ranch,
had been suffering from grip for several
weeks. The effects of the disease un
balanced his mind and he became a
subject of ravings and hallucinations.
Ditty was particularly violent last Fri
day and was closely watched. On Sun
day he appeared better and was al
lowed to take a walk with his son.
As Ditty did not return on Sunday the
farm employes organized a searching
party. Efforts to rind father and son
proved futile. On Monday a second,
party was formed, which examined the
bank 3of a reservoir near Baldwin's
summer hotel. A child's cap was found
on the bank, surrounded by many foot
prints, indicating that a struggle had
taken place. The reservoir was dragged
at this point last night and the body of
the father recovered.
As the corpse was being hauled up
from what appeared to be an upright
position a sudden jerking was noticed,
indicating that something had become
detached from the corpse. This evi
dently was the body of the child.
The dragging was resumed this morn
ing, and the body of the 12-year-old son
was recovered. It bore" marks of a
struggle and ofintense suffering. Those
who viewed the remains assert that the
father, who, in his delirium, struggled
with the boy and strangled him to
death, jumped into the reservoir, hold
ing the lad at arms' length, as the lad
fought to escape impending death.
The Coroner investigated the death of
Ditty and the child. The fact that
"Lucky" Baldwin acted as foreman of
th 3 Coroner's Jur;. . wl k-h inv.Â»tigatted
the circumstances surrounding the
death of his cook, caused much com
ment.
CUBAN INSURGENTS DEFY
AMERICAN AUTHORITY
It Is Reported That General Rabi
and His Band Have Taken to
the Hills.
HAVANA, Jan. l!4.â A report reached
General Monocal to-night that General
Rabi. with 1500 insurgents, had taken to
the hills in Santa Clara in defiance of
American authority. Rabi is a full
blooded Guantanamo Indian and a hard
lighter. Menocal hopes the report may
prove untrue.
Should Cuban soldiers take to the woods
and turn bandits, the United States mili
tary administration will know what to
do. They will be followed by a force of
cavalry and persistently pursued. The
same general method will be observed aa
has been followed in dealing with the In
dians on th; plains and mountains of the
West. The subject has been carefully
considered by old border fighters, who
are confident they could care for the ban
dits, notwithstanding the climatic condi
tions.
The Seventh Cavalry Regiment is sta
tioned in the province of Pinar del Rio,
the Second Cavalry Regiment in the
provinces of Santa Clara and Matanzas
and the Eighth Cavalry Regiment in the
province of Puerto Principe. The de
partment governors and the commanders
of the various garrisons have received in\
structions to keep on the alert and take
the first opportunity that the brigandage
may afford to show what the United
States soldiery can do to suppress it.

DAN BURNS CANNOT
GO TO THE SENATE
Forty-Six Republican Legislators Posi
tively Refuse to Go Into Caucus.
No Dictation Will Be Permitted on the Part of the
Southern Pacific Railroad When It Comes to Nam
ing the Representative of the State.
CAL-. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MEX-O, Jan. 24. â Twenty-seven
members of the Legislature who
have been voting for Ulysses S.
Grant for United States Senator
for two weeks and through twenty-nine
ballots to-night decided by unanimous
vote to remain firm and true to Grant
and his cause to the end of the present
â session of the Legislature.
N This means that Dan M. Burns will
never be a United States Senator from
OFFICIAL RECORD OF
DAN BURNS' DEFALCATION
"Hon. E. C. Marshall, Attorney-General-Sir: I have the honor herewith
to transmit to you the result of an investigation of the office of the Secretary of
State during the incumbency of D. M. Burns from January 5, 1880, to January 8,
1883. The examination shows Mr. Burns to be a defaulter to the State in the
SUm Of $31,738 59. _Fpom the Report of the State Controller.
The Grand Jury of Sacramento County returned twelve indictments against Burns for the fraudu
lent application of State funds in his charge. He was arrested and imprisoned. In the course of the
trial, in which Mr. Burns' only defense was an attempt to fasten the crimes laid to his charge on a deputy
who had been selected by him for his proficiency in political and other roguery, Burns admitted that
he had deliberately falsified the books. Here is his admission under oath:
"I took the memorandum cash book and changed these figures or
amounts. I did not change any figures, but where there would be $13.25 I
marked $9.75, and I took this cash book back to him (Deputy Gale) after the
eighth day of December some timeâ it must have been three or four days
afterward."
This is the kind of man the Southern Pacific proposes to foist upon the people as a Senator, and
it is because he is such .a man that the people of California are crying out to be saved from an impending
disgrace.
California if the supporters of Mr.
Grant's candidacy stand firm and true
to what they have agreed to do. There
is no reason to believe that they will
not, for twenty-four of them were pres
ent at the Grant caucus held this even
ing at the candidate's headquarters.
The roll was called and twenty-four
Senators and Assemblymen voted, as
one of them said afterward, "To stand
by Grant until the last dog was hung."
Three of the absentees sent word that
they would abide by the decision of the
caucus. They were all vouched for. Dr.
Marvin of Humboldt County was ab
sent and he sent no word as to what he
would do. He is privileged to do as he
pleases. â 
The Grant men give as a reason for
their action in deciding to vote for their
candidate until the adjournment of the
Legislature very strong reasons.
They state that they have agreed to
assert their fealty to Grant for the
reason that by doing so they will there
by defeat the desire of the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company, which cor
poration they look upon as endeavor
ing to force the election of Daniel M.
Burns through the head of its political
bureau. William F. Herrin.
The Grant men meant business to
night, for they acted with remarkable
unanimity, agreeing not to consider a
second choice candidate either now or
at any future time. They decided to be
Grant men, and nothing else, to the
bitter Â»nd.
Furthermore, they made no effort to
night to keep from the public anything
that was done at the caucus. They
were perfectly willing that a full re
port of what they did should go to the
press, and the report of the caucus
given by The Call is verified by ten
members of the Legislature who at
tended it.
Senator Boyce of Santa Barbara
called the caucus to order. Senator
Cutter of Yuba acted as secretary. The
roll call disclosed the presence of twen
ty-four members, the absentees being
Assemblymen Huber of Los Angeles,
Chynoweth of Orange, Dale of Kern,
all of whom sent word that they would
abide by the decision of the caucus. Dr.
Marvin, the Assemblyman from Hum
boldt, was present neither in fact nor
by promise as to what he would do.
Mr. Grant was present, and so was
Attorney Walter Bacon of Los Angeles.
Neither of these gentlemen, however,
participated in the discussion or de
liberations.
The first question decided was as to
whether or not Mr. Grant should be
voted for to the end of the Senatorial
contest by his present supporters. Upon
this point there was no difference of
opinion. Every man present was agreed
that it was the right thing to do and
the only thing. The fact was. laid be
fore those present that the State was
threatened with a groat danger in the
possibility of the election of Daniel M.
; Burns, whose character, standing: and
reputation were such as to make him
an unfit man upon whom to bestow the
toga.
It was further shown that the South
em Pacific Railroad was actively en
gaged in furthering the Senatorial
prospects of Burns through every
power its political bureau could assert
or in any way bring into play.
The claim was made by one As
semblyman present that the candidacy
of Robert N. Bulla for Senator was
also being sustained and kept up by
the Southern Pacific, through the
agency and at the request of Burns.
The matter was discussed in all of Its
phases and every one present was
I asked to express his views. Some
seventeen talked informally in favor of
adopting the resolution to stand by
Grant to the end. The roll was called
| and there was a unanimous vote in
favor of the resolution, which Included
a clause that at no time should those
participating in the caucus consider a
second choice candidate.
And thus endeth the last remote
prospect of the mine juniper of the
Candelaria to occupy a seat in a body
j in which Henry Clay, Daniel Webster,
Stephen A. Douglas, Allen G. Thurman,
John C. Calhoun. Roscoe Conkling and
others have made history for the world.
King Caucus cannot come to the res
cue of the colonel and the Southern
Pacific. The caucus of Mr. Grant's
supporters has utterly destroyed the
possibility of a general Republican
caucus, for outside of those who are
voting for him are other Republican
members who will never consent to
participate in nor be bound by one.
Eleven of Senator Bulla's supporters
are on record equally as strong as the
Grant men in opposition to any general
caucus on the Senatorial question.
The supporters of the candidacy of
General W. H. L. Barnes to the num
ber of eleven held a caucus this after
noon at 5 o'clock and decided to con
tinue voting for the general, and under
no circumstances to enter any Joint
Republican caucus. This is one addi
tional nail to the coffin which con
tains the remains of Dan Burns'
Senatorial boom.
Taking only the Grant men who were
present at the caucus (twenty-four),
add eleven Bulla supporters and eleven
more supporters of General Barnes, and
there is a total of forty-six out of
eighty-five Republican Senators and
Assemblymen who are absolutely
pledged not to go into a caucus.
One more William F. Herrin has
been outdone by men who are deter
mined that the Southern Pacific Com
pany shall not name the Senator from
California who is to be elected at this
session. Thus does It follow that, to
use the language of the street, Daniel
M. Burns is a "dead one."
HOW THE CAUCUS
AFFECTS CANDIDATES
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 24.â U. S. Grant declined
to be interviewed as to how he felt as
to the action of the caucus of his sup
porters, held this evening. He did say.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
however, that the loyalty of his friends
had caused him to feel deeply grate*ful
and he appreciated their fealty to thÂ«
very bottom of his heart. James Brown,
Grant's main adviser, in speak
ing of the matter, said: "Why, It Is Just
what we expected. Grant will be the
Senator before the session closes. It
will never be Dan Burns, and it will
never be Bulla."
"Suppose Burns and Bulla were both
to withdraw, would you then be will
ing to release the Grant supporters
from the caucus dictate requiring them
to unalterably vote for Grant to the
end, and leave them free to vote for
Grant or some other candidate as they
might see fit?"
"We will meet that contingency when
it arises. First, though, we want Mr.
Burns and Mr. Bulla to announce their
withdrawal from the floor of the joint
Assembly. In my opinion if these gen
tlemen will do this Grant would be
Senator."
General Barnes was not surprised
when he learned of the close alliance
the Grant men had formed. He said
that if it was maintained the Legis
lature would be a deadlock and the
State would be represented by one
j Senator in the Senate. He reiterated
! the proffer he had previously made.
1 which was to this effect: If at any
' time the elimination of his individuality
| from the Senatorial fight would settle
it he was willing to withdraw. He
also thought that the decision the
Grant forces had arrived at would have
no good effect on the candidacy of his
friend, Irving M. Scott.
Senator Bulla denied the assertion
made in the Grant caucus that he was
in any way the candidate of the South
ern Pacific or in the Senatorial flerht in
the interest of Colonel Burns or any
man other than Robert N. Bulla. The
Senator was rather surprised at the
course pursued by Grant's supporters.
He said that he would exact no such
pledge from any of his thirteen voters
in the Joint Assembly.
Colonel Burns when told of the ac
tion of the Grant men was unmoved
j and secretive. He refused to comment
upon it further than to say: "Watch
the ballots." Nevertheless, the Burns
; men are dumfounded. They never
! anticipated any such action from
Grant's supporters. They realize that
their cause is now absolutely hopeless
I and content themselves with denounc
ing what they are pleased to term the
"absolute Idiocy of those Grant gruys."

ON PRISON LABOR

Storm With His Bill.
An Effort to Prevent Convict Labor From
Coining in Conflict With That of Freemen
Brings About a Heated Debate
in the Assembly.
CALL, HEADQI'ARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 24.â Speaker pro tern. An
derson's bili is r.ot more than a paragraph
long but it raised a column of storm when
It came up in the Assembly this morning.
Its provisions are as follows:
Section Iâ lt shall be unlawful for the Board
of State Prison Directors or the State Prison
authorities at FplÃom," or any other "State
penal institution in the State of California,
to engage or employ any person confined or
employed in any penal institution in said State
in the quarrying of raw material, or in the
manufacturing of anything whatever that is
an article of commerce in this State, except
"broken stone to be used exclusively upon
county or State roads, other material to be
used exclusively on country or State roads,
jute bags, and articles consumed exclusively
In the- State' institutions: provided, that noth
ing In this act 'shall prevent the working of
the inmates of any State institution upon
county or State roads."
In other words Assemblyman Anderson's
object is to prevent the product of the
convict coming in competition with that
of the freeman. K<>< k crushed â â¢â¦ the
prison is sold to contractors in the cities
at a price which would ruin the free
owner of a quarry, and the result has
bof-n. according to Mr Anderson, that
many of the private quarries have gone
under. Mr. Anderson's biil provides that
â¢ 'â  prison product shall be sold only to
i ounty Boards <>f Supervisor! or for use
on county roads.
It caniH up under the head of unfinished
business, uiu! Assemblyman Knights of
mento came to nfaa f*"Â»t with an
amendment which provided that the rock
should also be sold to private contractors.
The amendment. !:" passed, would have ut
t( rlv destroyed the Intent of Mr. Ander
son's measure. He rose to derend it. but
was headr-d off by Dibble of San Fran
cisco, who took tne defense on his own
shoulders, and fur the lirst time during
the present session delivered one of those
forcible, timely speeches that have won
for him his own way on the floor on more
than on*. 1 occasion. He struck the keynote
u> his argument when he said. "Convict
labor should never be permitted to come
in competition with that of the freemen,"
an*! upon it be based his speech.
â¢ 'aminetti of Amador, who voted for a
similar bill in 1897, had evidently since
become convinced for he came out against
it to-day with all the wind of his well
stocked lungs. He argued that the low
prh-' of prison crushed rock made im
provements possible that otherwise would
not have been made, and that as a result
of it more freemen were given work than
would lie if private quarries were per
mitted to maintain a monopoly.
He was hotly replied to by Mr. Ander
son, who throw up to him his past record
on the bill and brought statistics into the j
â¢ in a most convincing manner.
mblyman Dunlap of Stockton took
the prison en?! of it and declared that be
contractors had been able to pet
prison crushed rock at a less price the
street makers of Stockton had been able
lo pay out to free laborers over $300,000
that they otherwise would not have got.
Dibble "again took the floor and Conrey
of Los Angeles and Brooke of Sacramento
both moved that both bill and amend
ments be referred to the Committee on
Labor and Capital and State Prisons for
joint consideration.
Just after the noon recess Dibble moved
that "Senate messages" be at once taken
up and Senate Bill 845, which the attenu
ated assistant secretary of the Senate had
brought in in the morning, came under
Immediate consideration. Bill 315 takes
tin- place of bill 199 and embodies the
same Intent, viz.. to let the treasury gate
open to the horde of would-be attaches
waiting lust outside.
Valentine of Los Angeles moved that it
be given its second reading as a matter of
emergency, but the roll call developed
that the tWO-thirSs vote necessary to pass
the motion was not in the Hous<^. A roll
call of the absentees was called for and
later a call of the lions.', and after the
recalcitrant ones had been rounded up
the doors were locked and another roll
call orderi d. , , ,
Relshaw opened a fight by introducing
an amendment inserting the two-thirds
clause. Instead of the three-lifths. but
i omptly voted down.
On the roll call on suspension the min
ority all voted no. but did the graceful
thing by changing to "aye." providing
*>nriugh votes to carry the question, and
the bill was finally passed and sent back
to the Senate.
Adjournment was taken on motion of
Conrey of Los Angeles.
THEY REGARD SCOTT
AS MOST AVAILABLE
Explanation of the Sudden Boom
to His Senatorial
Aspirations.
The announcement that Irving M.
Scott was to enter upon an active can
vass for the United States Senatorship
caused considerable of a stir in political
circles yesterday. It was the general
impression that with Mr. Scott avowed
ly in the tight an entirely new aspect
was given to the whole situation.
What strength he will develop at
Sacramento is, of course, pufely con
jecture, and there are some who are in
clined to the belief that he will merely
complicate matters the more, instead
of presenting an easy way out of the
present dilemma. The gentlemen who
are at the head of Mr. bcott's cam
paign have put him forward more
prominently in the hope that the con
tending factions in the Legislature will
be able to unite on him and bring to
an end tho long deadlock, which, they
believe, is working an injury to the
Republican party and the State.
Some of the best-known business men
in the city arc behind tho movement
and have announced their determina
tion to go to Sacramento in the interest
of Mr. Bcott. SÂ»me of them went up !
last evening and others expect to go '
tn-night. Among those who have taken |
up the cause of Mr. Scott are members
of some Hi the representative commer
cial and industrial bodies of San Fran
cisco, but they are art ing as individuals !
and in no way as the representatives !
of their respective organizations.
Their position was accurately defined !
by F. W. Dohrmann of the Merchants'
Association, who, speaking for himself
only, as a promoter of Scott's candi
dacy, said yesterday: "I have gone
Into this matter, not because of any
prejudice against any of the other can
didates, but solely with a view of re
storing harmony. Mr. Scott. I believe, j
If a man on whom all the Republican
legislators can unite and thar is why j
I am willing to do what I can to pro- i
mote his candidacy. I shall go to Sac- '
ramento either this evening or to-mor- J
row night, but I want it understood j
that I do not go as a representative of '
I
the Merchants' Association, but merely
as an individual. Once more I will say
that 1 am entirely free from prejudice
against any of the other candidates
and if I saw any prospect of an amica
ble ending of the present state of af
fairs 1 would not take any part what
ever in the Senatorial struggle."

j and A. B. C. Dohrmann. They were
\ warmly welcomed by Senator Davis and
Assf-mblyman Dunlap, who were in Mr.
Scott's room when the reinforcements ar
j rived. The supporters of Scott outlined a
plan of campaign to-night.
In the tirst place, members of the Leg
islature will be invited to meet the
j builder of the Oregon. It was remarked
as significant that Senator Davis and As
semblyman Dunlap. who haÂ» - e been vot
ing for Scott from the outset, never saw
him until to-night. It can be left to con
jecture as to the number of men that
will vote for Mr. Scott after they see him.
It was said in a general way at Scott's
headquarters to-night that business men
! of San Francisco advised him to plunge
into the thickest of the struggle, say
ing. "Go to Sacramento and get acquaint
ed witli the members of the Legislature
The deadlock can be broken if an accept
able candidate shall be presented. We
will send leading men of the city to sup
port you, and business men of Stockton
Sacramento and other cities of the Stat**
will join in urging the Legislature to ac
cept you as the man for the United States
Senate."
I When the question was asked if Mr
: Scott would stay for the finish Senator
Davis and ex-Mayor Ellert remarked that
THE DEADLOCK WAITS

think this deadlock will be broken until the report of the investigat
ing committee is in," said Assemblyman Lardner to-day. "And manybe

the report will be submitted to-morrow."
Evidently every one else is of about the same opinion. Just one bal
lot sufficed to-day to demonstrate that no effective politics has been done
these last twenty-four hours. Even the "honoraries" polled their usual
strength, and Senator Simpson proposed the customary adjournment. It
carried without dissent, and 12 o'clock noon to-morrow is the appointed
hour for the next attempt. To-days ballot follows:

field is surveyed.
Mr. Scott shortly after his arrival paid
his respects tc General Barnes. He will
probably visit Colonel Burns, Senator
Bulla and U. 8. Grant Jr. to-morrow.
DEMOCRATS TIRED OF*
OF THE AUTOCRATS
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 24.â Senator Fc-eney has in
troduced a bill in the Senate which has
for its purpose the abrogation of the com
mittee of one hundred who have been the
autocrats of the San Francisco Democ
racy.
Senator Feeney's bill provides that no
nominations for any political party can
be made by appointment. They must be
made by conventions.
The clause of Senator Feeney's bill
which strikes the committee of one hun
dred reads as follows:
Any convention, as hereinafter defined, held
for the purpose of making nominations for
public office, and also electors, to the number
hereinafter specified, may nominate candidates
for public office to be filled by election within
the State. A convention. Within the meaning
of this act, is an organized assemblage of.
delegates, elected by ballot at a primary elec
tion, and representing v political party which,
at the last election before the holding of such
convention, polled at least three per cent of the
entire vote, of the State, county, district, or
other political division for which the nomina
tion is made; provided, that in any county,
township, city or district wherein no general
election shall have been held after its organi
zation, a convention of any party polling at
least three per cent of the votes cast In the
precincts composing such county, township,
city or district shall have tlif same power,
and its nominations the same effect a? though
Mich eoUQty, township, city, or district had
been organized before the next preceding gen
eral election.
Senator Feeney was asked what the pur
pose and intent of his bill was and he re
plied:
"We have laws in this State which ex
pressly provide for the holding of pri
mary elections and the selecting of dele
gates- to nominating conventions. Why.
then, should a clique be permitted to ob
tain control of the organization of a party
and arbitrarily designate a committee to
name its nominees for office and destroy
the right of the great body of the party
to in any way participate in the nomina-
tions. It Is to put an end to this prac
tice that my bill was introduced."
Senator Dwyrr, in talking about the bill,
said: "I favor the proposition to put a
stop to the practice at having any com
mittee name nominees for a political
party. It is un-American. We nave K""<1
primary election laws which have been
enacted to Insure clean nominations \>y
political parties, and I think they should
be used."
The bill seem? to meet with considera
ble favor in the Senate.
Scarcity of Committee Booms.
('ALT, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 24.â The scarcity of fnreting
room has already In the present session
seriously hampered committee work and
the sergeant-at-arms of Assembly and
Senate have been hard put to it to find
meeting rooms for the most important
legislative business. The Committee on
Public Works of the Senate thinks the
problem is solved in a resolution to make
use of the abundance space in the at
tir of the Capitol, where there is room
for a half-dozen commodious committee
rooms. A bill will be shortly presented in
the Assembly which will provide the nec
essary appropriation and set the work in
motion so that before the session ends
the new rooms be made use of.
WAITING NOW FOR
THE WHITEWASH
Bribery investigation Ready to Ring
Down the Curtain.
Gommitteemen Will Throw All the Responsibility
on the Assembly and Wash Their Hands
of the Affair.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MEXTO, Jan. 4.â The official investigation
of the charges made against Speaker of
the Assembly Howard E. Wright is at an
end. All that remains to be done is to ap
ply the coat of whitewash to the faded
reputation of the disgraced statesman.
The committee having charge of the in
vestigation has not yet decided on the
exact formula by which the whitewash
is to be prepared, but this makes little
difference so long as it Is white. Dan
Burns has promised the' discredited
Speaker of the Assembly that he will
save him from the immediate conse
quences of his infamy, ar.d, as every
one knows. Burns cares little for the
methods adopted so long as the desired
end is attained. That he will be abie to
keep his promise In this instance seems
certain if one were to accept the acts of
the committee as a guide to conjecture.
As for the charges that have been
made against other Assemblymen
and those who have sought to unduly in
fluence the acts of legislators there will
be entered the general verdict of "not
proven." All witnesses save those who
had evidence to give that would be injuri
ous to the candidacy of U. S. Grant have
been handled with' the greatest tender
ness, and seemingly no effort has beer,
spared that would bring out facts benefi
cial to Burns. But in spite of all the
truth has been plain to the public, and no
matter what the report of the committee
may be Wright stands convicted by the
people of the State whom he had sworn
to serve and whoso trust he betrayed.
The taking of testimony was practically
concluded by the committee this after
noon. It is possible that one or two addi
tional witnesses will be examined to-mor
row, but the greater part of the day will
be consumed in preparing the report that
is to be made to the Assembly on Thurs
day. This report will shift the responsi
bility of fixing the exact definition of
Wright's disgrace from the committee to
the Assembly. Tt will be asserted that
Wright, as Speaker of the Assembly, is
the creature of the Assembly and that it
is for the Assembly to deal with him. The
committee will report the facts as they
have been brought out before it by the
sworn testimony of numerous witnesses
and upon these facts the Assembly must
act. There is probably not one member
of the Assembly who doubts Wright's
guilt, but there are many who may be
induced to shuf their eyes to their own
convictions for reasons of self-interest.
Charles G. Lamberson of Visalia, who,
it is said, acted as the agent of Assembly
man Cosper in the solicitation of a $6000
bribe from U. S. Grant, it being alleged
that the proposition was made to Milton
J. Green, Grant's political manager, failed
to present himself to the committee to
day, though it is said that he had sent
a telephone message to Mr. Cosper saying
he would be on hand to give his testi
mony. The other witnesses, who have
failed to appear in response to subpenas
are M. H. Do .Young and Milton J. Green.
Both are said to be ill and not in a fit
condition physically to appear on the wit
ness stand. It Is not expected that Mr.
Lamberson would bo foolish enough to
convict himself, if he were guilty, by
testifying that he acted as the agent of
Cosper in the solicitation of a bribe.
As the other party to the alleged trans
action is ill it goes without saying that
the charge against Cosper will fall for
want "f substantiation. Mr. Cosper will
thus be afforded the pleasure of roport
ing hack to the Assembly that the tru'h
of the charges against the chairman of
the investigating committee have not been
proved.
One other witness that has thus far
escaped the ordeal of the witness chair
Is Assemblyman R. C. Dale. The charge
has been made that Mr. Dale was ap
proached with an offer of $8000 if he woulrt
vote for R. N. Bulla as his second f hoice
candidate for United States Senator. An
effort has been made to get Mr. Dale on
the witness stand to testify as to the
truth or falsity of this charge, but it has
thus far proved unavailing-. J. E. Cope
land, a Los Angeles attorney, who, it is
said, was the person who made the of.
fer to Dale, was a witness before the
investigating committee to-day. He de
nied most emphatically that he had ever
made an offer of any kind to Dale or to
any other member of the Legislature. He
admitted that he may have "joshed" with
Mr. Dale on the subject of the Sena
torial .situation, but he was certain that
he had never carried his good natured
raillery to the extent of offering Dale
money to support any particular Sena
torial candidate.
Senator William M. Cutter was called
as B witness at his own request for the
purpose of giving him an opportunity to
deny the truth of any rumors that Grant
had furnished him money with which to
make his canvass. He denounced fiuc'n
rumors as false and malicious. He was
followed by Assemblyman A. H. Raw,
who wished to enter a similar denial.
During the course of the Investigation H
was brought out that Speaker Wright
had asked the question if the person to
whom he was talking had heard of the
money Cutter and Raw had received
from Grant. Both Mr. Cutter and Mr.
Raw asked and were granted permission
to be sworn that they might give to their
denials the full weight of legal evidence.
The story of the two tickets that Wil
liam F. Herrln gave to Assemblyman A.
H. Merrill at the request of D. M. Burns
was retold to-day, this time by Mr. Mer
rill himself. During the course of his
testimony he declared that he wished it
distinctly understood that he could not
be bought for the price of two railroad
tickets, and that any one who thought he
could had better get a position -->n the
San Francisco newspapers with the bal
ance of the fools. As Mr. Merrill failed
to state what price he could be bought
for, the newspaper men present were
satisfied to submit their case without
putting in a defense.
The witness related in detail how a
friend of his wanted to go to New York
with his wife, but had only sufficient
money to buy one ticket. Merrill volun
teered to assist him, and to this end went
to Herrln and asked if he could get two
tickets for the price of one. Herri n re
plied that he could not. Merrill then
went to Burns and that gentleman sent a
note to Herrln. which had the effect of
causing Herrln to produce the two tick
et^ without charge. Mr. Merrill failed to
say why ho had applied to Herrin in the
first (instance instead of to the general
ticket office of the company. His story
differed in some essential details from
that told by Herrin and Burns, but it was
accepted in good faith by the committee,
the members of which refrained from
cross-questioning the witness too closely.
As the committee will in all probabllity
closo its labors to-morrow, it may be
proper to point to the fact that it has suc
ceeded in dodging the necessity of making
any investigation of the charge that the
agents of Burns and the Southern Pacific
Company Bought to bribe Assemblyman
Brooke to vote for Burns for Senator.
After the election a contest was filed
against the seat of Brooke in the As
sembly. Burns' agonts and the railroad
officials who interested themselves in the
transaction offered to cause the contest
to be withdrawn and to give Brooke a
position in the County Clerk's office in
this county if Brooke would pledge him
self to vote for Burns for Senator. The
Call exposed the whole scheme to de
buuch Brooke, with the result that the
conspirators were forced to abandon their
plan. As an investigation of this infa
mous plot would tend to throw discredit
on Burns and his Senatorial candidacy
the reason why the investigating com
mittee has skipped it need not be pointed
out.

"BETTER NO SENATOR
THAN DAN BURNS"
Reply to the Defiance of the Mexican's
â¢ Henchmen,
All Indications Now Point to a Deadlock Until
the Close of the Legislative
Session.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 24.â The indications to
night are that a United States Senator
will not be elected at this session of the
Legislature. Burns has declared that
he will not yield in favor of any other
candidate. The Grant men are angry
and resolute. When it comes to firm
ness of purpose they can give odds to
the touts. To-night the Grant men re
solved to stand by their candidate un
til the close of the session. This signi
fies that there will be no caucus, and
no caucus means the defeat of Burns.
The "organization" is responsible for
the rule or ruin policy how foreshad
owed. Burns came here with his sup-
porters of the Republican State Central
Committee to elect himself or permit
no other candidate to run. His hench
men defiantly say, "You will take
Burns or get no Senator." .The reply is
coming, "Better no Senator than Burns
in the Senate."
The touts are putting on a bold front
to-night. They boast that Colonel

Burns will get a caucus by next Mon
day evening and secure his election as
United States Senator by Wednesday
of next week. The touts of high and
low degree tell the same story. It is
evident that the word has gone out
from the "organization" that Burns'
stuck must be boomed. No doubt the
orders are passed out from the colonel's
headquarters that his followers must
assume that victory is in sight and
make predictions that the achievement
will be recorded on a certain day. The
colonel is not springing a new game. It
is the old deal under a new form.
At one stage of the campaign word
went out that Burns would gain five
.votes on the next day's balloting. The
gain did not appear. Later on it was
denied that the colonel had made any
prediction of gain that week, but that
he had fifteen votes staked out among
other candidates and that at a given
signal they would rally around the
candidate of the "organization." The
signal was given, but they did not rally
around Dan's standard. Every art and
trick known to the adroit in the man
agement of political affairs was em
ployed to increase the voting strength
of the "colonel," but it did not increase.
The talk to-night is a sample of the
same old bluff.
It is acknowledged to-night in the
camps of other candidates that Burns
might win out in the dark should a
sufficient number of Republican mem
bers to elect a Senator agree to go into
secret caucus to settle the contest.
There is no indication at this time that
such an agreement can be obtained. On
the contrary, the determination to re
sist caucus overtures seems to be firmer
than ever.
The members of the Legislature who
are voting for General Barnes met this
afternoon and exchanged views. The
meeting was enthusiastic and pro
longed. It was unanimously resolved to
stand by General Barnes to the finish
and to endeavor to bring accessions to
his cause. The supporters of the gen
eral have not sought to increase his
strength by asking their fellow mem
bers to vote for him, but it was de
cided Â£t the conference to-day that ac
tive work in his behalf should begjn.
The subject of a caucus was discussed
and it was the unanimous expression
of all the supporters of General Barnes
that they would not, while present con
ditions existed, consent to go into cau
cus on the Senatorship. The Senators
and Assemblymen without hesitation
expressed a determination to stand as
firm as a rock in support of the general.
The conference was the happiest and
most enthusiastic session since the
campaign opened.
Irving M. Scott arrived here shortly
after 8 o'clock this evening. He was
at once escorted to his headquarters in
room 11 of the Golden Ea~le Hotel by
Senator Davis of Amador and ex-
Mayor Ellert of San -'rancisco. Scott's
arrival created some commotion among
the Burns touts, but no alarm was
manifested. Inquiries were made re
garding the financial resources of the
new aspirant and whether he would
open out in generous style. Mr. Scott
said ihat he was in the field as a can
didate for the Senate. While he had
been placed in nomination and had been
voted for on every ballot since the be
ginning of the contest, he had not
deemed it advisable to establish head
quarters in Sacramento until the busi
ness men of San Francisco had urged
him to adopt such a course.
"I am here," said Mr. Scott, "to look
over the field and form my own con
clusions of the struggle. It has been
suggested to me that my active par-"
ticipation in the contest might break
the deadlock and enable the Legis
lature to elect a Senator."

mysterious unknown which the future
is to develop. It may be Barnes, it may
be Scott, it may be somebody not yet

worth watching. Of course a climax is

As this is written the investigation
committee is in session at the Capitol.
Its work is dFawing to a close, and, as
Baid often in these letters, does not
amount to anything beyond the exposure
of the untrustworthiness of Speaker
Wright and the glorification of Burns.
I have not the slightest admiration for
the game of politics. It is rotten
throughout, its basis deception, its pur
i v;i and its participants respect
able men who in matters pertaining to
their cailing are not to be believed
under oath. Yet there is possibility
of admiring the consummate skill
which makes the black white and the
round square. Everybody to-day is
liing at the Burns capture of the
itlgatlon committee. There was
a smoother operation. The com
mittee had brought the Grant cam-
Into disrepute, it had listened to
an arraignment of methods employed
in behalf of Bulla, and then tho Burns
forces appeared upon the scene to show
how pure they were, how lofty their
aspirations, how spotless their in
â >-. they showed it. I do not
'.hat all listeners accepted the
nee, but it stands on the record,
against it the word of a single witness,
and sustaining it the words of the dig-
I push, headed by Burns himself.
There is no course open to the com
mittee but a general vindication, which
will leave matters just as they were in
the beginning, for anybody knows that
truth has been perverted, repressed and
lia's had substituted for it fiction so
groundless as to excKe the risibles of
v horse. Yet this fiction stands as fart.
It will not be controverted nor im
pugned. The Burns people were wise
-missing their touts and resorting
to diplomacy. For myself Ido not care
what the decision of the committee
may be. It will have been practically
dictated, and it will slaver the whiten
THE PEOPLE TO VOTE
ON CHURCH TAXATION
r.\LL HEADQUARTERS, SA<"RA
MKXTO, Jan. 24.â The proposition as to
whether or not all buildings used exclu
sively as churches and chapels and so
much of tlv real property on which they
required for the
id occupation of such
buildings, shall be free from taxation will
In all probability be submitted to the
people t,:~ this State to vote upon as a con
stitutional amendment.
The Senate Committee on Judiciary de
to report this amendment, intro-
Ltor Wolfe, favorably at a
met ting held this afternoon. There were
but two dissenting votes.
The discussion of this amendment was
fixed as a special order by the committee
for action this afternoon.
Archbishop Riordan of San Francisco
appeared with the Rev. Dr. Bogard as
the representative of the churches.
Th< Archbishop made a most eloquent
appeal to the committee in requesting fa r
vorable action from the committee upon
the amendment. He was frequently ap
plauded by a number of auditors who
were present to hear the argument and
the committee's action.
The Archbishop stated that he consid
tbe churches as important factors
in making men and in educating them to
a proper conception of their duties to
their country and to their State.
lit itated ihÂ«it be was emphatically op
posed to any coalition of church and state
but at the sin â¢ insisted that It
was undÂ« niably true that religion did
much to make ini-n moral and thereby re
lieved the state of what would otherwise
be a heavy burden upon it. â¢
The Archbishop insisted that California
had the poorest church edifices of any
State in the Union and the reason for it
was that not only the edifices but the
ground on which they stood were taxed
and the church organizations building
them wore always compelled to consider
whether or not they would be able to
carry them on alter they were buili.
The speaker further said that California
churches were now built of the cheapest
kind of material, in building the cathe
dral on Van i..ess avenue the Archbishop
Btated that he had originally Intended to
have it of granite, and that he was com
pelled to build it of brick, as it cost less
and the taxes would thereby be lowered.
The Archbishop cited the fad that in
Eastern cities the church edifices were
the pride of the people, but not so in Cali
fornia. In closing the Archbishop made
a general pica tor the exemption of
churches provided for in the proposed
'constitutional amendment which was ad
mitted to bÂ» very strong.
The Rev. Dr. Bogard then ma
strong address asking favorable action
at the hands of the committee upon the
matter under discussion.
Senator Cutter offered an amendment
limiting the amount of property exempt' d
by the terms of the amendment from tax
tion to $10,000.
Th e amendment was lost by a vote of
ing over everything in sight, including
perhaps even Speaker Wright.
This leads naturally to consideration
of Wright. I cannot but feel sorry for
the man, as for the under dog in the
fight. He is utterly discredited in the j
eyes of the public. He is looked upon j
as a man who sold himself and repudi- |
an-d the sale. Since he did this many j
facts have been brought to light con- i
cerning him and they all seem to be j
to his deeper disgrace. At times he i
puts up a bold front, but for the most i
part he cringes. His voice has lost its
former ring, his attitude its air of con
ftdence. When a member shakes his
hand he accepts the act as a favor.
He is relying upon the committee of !
Investigation, but no committee can :
save him. If he has to be included in i
the whitewash bath, which I predict is !
In preparation, he will loom up through i
the flood of hand-made purity like a !
lighthouse in a fog, but with the light
â¢ xtinguished.
The loudest thing in this city is Sen
ator Short ridge, aided by his vest and
abetted by his necktie. The vest is an J
"live-green creation, dotible-breasted '
and with rows of buttons like the
agates with which in the days of youth
I played fot "'keeps." The tie is white
and pink, gleaming with jewels. At |
first it fooled the fire department â but ;
is now recognized as a false alarm. '
The Senator adorns his rotund form
with a coat collared with imported fur, i
and he consults the weather Indications |
to ascertain whether or not to surmount j
his beauty with a silken tile. If the j
signs are unpropitious he uses the som- J
brero already known to fame.
But it is in the halls of legislation
that the Senator shines with a radiance !
seldom equaled, and never eclipsed. He I
is a word attist. At his right hand is |
a dictionary, at his left a thesaurus. I
He has not yet charmed the ear I
markedly^ but his bosom swells with ;
ambition and on his bulging brow is
the luster of thoughts serene and origi- j
j nal. Shortridge will be heard from :
i yet; there is no help for it. He is
loaded and at any moment the pyro- i
technics may be touched off.
Among the developments of the situ- i
ation has been the salivary ejaculation j
t Major McLaughlin. He tried to douse '
i the optical glim of Goucher. Or, to
be plain almost to the point of vul- !
parity, he spat Into Goucher's eye. It
Is not my pleasure to know Goucher,
but I know the major as a gentleman,
whose treatment of newspaper repre
sentatives is ever courteous. Neverthe
less, this thing of spitting is reprehen
sible. To spit on the pavement is In
terdicted and to spit in the face of a
human being, made in the image of i
God, is infinitely worse. I can think of 1
no excuse in any measure justTfying it, I
; and as a spitter would regard the act :
' as a capital offense, and myself the j
executioner appointed of Heaven and
: ready to hang foe it. Goucher may be j
| a person of gentle nature. However, :
', if he thinks the matter over and con- 'â 
j eludes to resent it he cannot do better
i than get me on the jury. '
Lobbyists are beginning to get thick.
i Among them are so many preachers [
! that to discuss the morality of the gen- i
! eral scheme of lobbying is out of the :
I question. It must be right or they I
I would not be here. The preachers are
I interested in a plan to exempt from !
taxation all church property. I do not '
Bee any reason why this should be done,
but there may be reasons without num- \
I ber. Certainly there are plenty of ad
vocates on hand to present all there !
are, for six ministers, none of them I
belonging to Sacramento, were ob- 1
m rved to-day with their eyes toward I
the sky but their fingers hooked in but- j

DISCUSSING BENEFITS
TO STANFORD UNIVERSITY
CALL, HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 24.â President Jordan and
Professor Nathan Abbott of Stanford
T'niversity appeared before the Senate
Committee on Judiciary this evening in
behalf of Senate constitutional amend
ment 11. which is a proposition to add
a !!â  w section to the constitution of the
l State, confirming the founding of the uni
veralty and the trust and giving addi
tional powers to the trustees. it also
exempts the grounds and buildings lo
cated upon them from taxation.
Professor Jordan delivered quite an ex- ]
tended address, giving reasons why the
1 amendments as proposed should receive
I favorable consideration at the hands of
i the committee. He cited the fact that
there were some acts of the trustees
; which had been performed under the trust
; about which there might be legal techni
calities, and It was desirable that the
trust be confirmed by the constitution of
the State. As to the tax exemption re-
I querted. Professor Jordan thought that
j the people of the State would be willing
I to vote to grant the concession, as it
THE SAN FEAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1899.
would thereby place Stanford University
upon exactly the same basis as the State
University at Berkeley.
Professor Abbott also made a similar
argument touching more particularly up
on the legal phases of the proposed con
stitutional amendment as well as the jus
tice which it would give to the university,
which, he said, was one of the greatest
gifts the people of any State in the Union
had ever received at the hands of one of
its citizens.
The committee listened to the argument,
but decided that it was better to postpone
final action until tho next meeting.
MORE ATTACHES TO
BE PROVIDED SOON
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 24.â The Senators to-day
had the amended Belshaw act before
them for consideration. It came up under
second, reading, and there was quite a
little discussion as to the feasibility of
increasing the expenses of the upper
house of the Legislature $71 per day on
the matter of engaging additional at
taches.
But as the Senators and Assemblymen
have a small army of hangers-on who
have been waiting for three weeks for
the bill to become a law they voted on
motion of Senator Cutter to declare it a
case of urgency and passed the bill.
First, however. Senator Sims asked that
the vote by which the Senate is privi
leged to increase its corps of employes
that are specifically provided in the bill
be changed from three-fifths to four
fifths.
Senator Shortridge argued that if this
amendment was adopted it would indi
cate a lack of confidence on the part of
the Senators in their own honesty.
Senator Simpson agreed with Senator
Shortridge. Senator Stratton then cut off
debate by moving the previous question,
and upon a viva voce vote the amend
ment was -defeated.
Senator Gillette, the chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, stated that the
work of the committee had been greatly
hampered by the lack of clerical assist
ance, whereupon Senator Flint informed
him that there were at present thirteen
committee clerks.
Senator Cutter explained that a Â»reat
many necessary employes had been work
ink without pay In expectation of the
passage of the act. By a vote of 27 to 4
the bill was passed.

THE ORR INQUEST.
The Coroner Replies to Charges Made
Against Him.
Coroner Hill held an inquest yesterday
on the body of Frank E. Orr, one of the
victims of the collision of the launch Wil
liam D with the ferry steamer Oakland.
The survivors of the launch swore that
they did not see the ferry-boat, while the
officers of the steamer swore that they
gave the danger signal as soon as they
saw the launch, which was 100 yards
away, but that the launch came straight
on, and when the steamer reversed her
engines she had too much headway to
prevent a collision. The jury' returned a
verdict blaming nobody.
With reference to the complaint of W.
H. Stackpole regarding the disposition of
the body of young Orr, Coroner Hill en
ters a general denial. He acknowledges
that he preferred that the business should
go to some San Francisco undertaker
rather than to an Oakland firm, but says
that he was ready at any time to deliver
the remains to the friends of the deceased
on the receipt of Mr. Montealegre. After
numerous delays this gentleman receipted
for the body, and it was taken across the
bay. The Coroner further asserts that
he was acting within his rights and for
his own protection.
Referring to the disposition of un
claimed dead. Dr. Hill said that there is
no city undertaker, but that he has an
arrangement by which such bodies are
turned over to undertakers of the city by
rotation, thus giving each an equal share of
the patronage. This arrangement, he
saySi will be continued throughout his ad
ministration.

of California Pioneers was held at their
hall on Fourth street last evening In the
presence of over 700 invited guests?.
The feature of the occasion was an ad
dress by Jui'.go Cotton, on the subject of
the discovery ftf gold and the influence the
event has worked on tIK- entire State. In
it be outlined the growth of the State,
attributing its marvelous progress during
the past tifty years from the time
that the yellow metal was discov
ered. He emphasized particularly the
growth of San Francisco from the insig
nificant mining camp to the greatest met
ropolis in the West.
The address was concluded with a trib
ute to the memory of the pioneers who
worked the first mine iv the State and
occupy one of the greatest positions in
the history of California.

Sergeant Coogan and posse raided the

capable bimetallist upon whom the
anti-Stewart forces could more easily
combine. Owing to a divergence of
views as to the method of union, the
time at which it should be effected and
the candidate, the ta?k of uniting the
anti-Stewart forces was most difficult,
and while we were engaged in efforts
to unite these forces Stewart succeeded
in securing sufficient votes to obtain a
majority. My name, therefore, was
â not presented to the Legislature. The
victory gained by the people at the
polls has been reversed in the Legisla
ture and the Southern Pacific is victori
ous. The question for the future is
whether the administration of govern
ment in Nevada shall be controlled by
the people or the Southern Pacific Com
pany. The issue will be pressed with
vigor."
The one theme of conversation about
the Capitol corridor, hotels and streets
to-night is Newiands' utter defeat. The
fact that his name was not presented
before either house gave his friends
wiici were not "on the inside" a political
chill, and they are wondering how he
could have been so badly managed.
Stewart in an interview says that he
is satisfied that his record on silver is
nbove reproach, and that the cause of
the white metal is not killed. He Says
the fight against him was directed by
enemies and traitors, but sound judg
ment prevailed and his work for silver
and Nevada wllL continue. He has
been busy at headquarters receiving
congratulations and opening telegrams.
The investigating committee which
probed the bribery charge against As

transcribing of the testimony before re

SUISUN MURDER
SUSPECTS LIKELY
TO BE RELEASED
Evidence at the Preliminary Ex
anyrnatioo Not Deemed Suffi
cient to Hold Them.
BUISUN, Jan. 24.â T\e mystery sur .
rounding the assassination of Daniel H.
Wilson at Ms ranch on the Ssuisuh road
on the night of October 9, 18^s. is still
unsolved. The preliminary examination
of William J. Miller, Mrs. Elizabeth -G.
Dickinson, his mother, and Mrs. Aduie
Wilson, his sister, jointly charged with
the murder of the latter's ex-husband,
is ended, so far as the testimony is con
cerned, *and while the three prisoners
are yet confined in the Solano County
Jail they will in all probability be given
their liberty in the morning on motion
of District Attorney Devlin.
The prosecuting officer of the county
intimated that this course would be
pursued when he moved for a continu
ance of the case until 10 a. m. to-mor
row, after the conclusion of the testi
mony at 5 o'clock this evening. Mr.
Devlin said that as over a softre of wit
nesses had been examined he desired
to have time to fully digest the im
portance of the evidence before making
up hie mind to ask the court to com
mit the three prisoners for trial and his
motion was granted.
The result of the day's proceedings
â was a surprise and a disappointment to
the officers who have been instrumental
in placing the accused behind the bars.
While some of the evidence tends
strongly to oonnect Miller with the
murder, it is by no means conclusive.
"With few exception*, the witnesses
who were depended upon to establish
the guilt of Miller and the women
failed completely when placed on the
witness-stand to fulfill expectations.
They qualified their previous state
ments or denial outright ever having
uttered the remarks attributed to them.
Samuel Riley, who rented the rig in
which Miller us alleged to have driven
from Vallejo to the Wilson ranch on
the night of the assassination, posi
tively identified the principal defendant
in the < ase as the man who procured
the horse and buggy at the Callonder
stable on the evening of October 9,
William S. Craig was reasonably sure
Miller was the man who returned the
rig to the stable before daylight on the
following morning, but as the fellow
had his face muffled with the collar of
his coat and his hat pulled down over
his eyes, Craig could not be positive.
Mrs. Mary Hayes, who was a next
door neighbor of Miller in Vallejo, tes
tified to having seen Wilson s alleged
â layer in his yard at about 5:30 o'clock
on i tie morning of October 10, fully
dressed and wearing a. long coat.
Aside fn 'in these three witnesses none
was put upon the stand whose testi
mony would go far toward convincing
a jury of the guilt of any one of the
accused.
As an offset to the testimony of Rib
and Craig. Mrs. Eliza SheeTian of Val
lejo swore that she saw and conversed
with Miller in front of her house at
on the evening of October 9, while
her two daughters, Maggie and Katie.
testified that they spent several hours
at Miller's house that evening and were
entertained by him. These alibi wit
nesses each told the same story to the
minutest detail, employing almost the
same language. The testimony of the
other witnesses, while interesting and
to a certain extent picturesque, failed
to directly connect the prisoners with
the tragedy.
The preliminary examination was
held before Justice of the Peace A. F
Hitchcock, in the Superior Court room
at Fairfield. Long before 10 o'clock, the
hour set for the hearing, the courtroom
was crowded with curious spectators
including many women.
Dr. W. D. Downing of Suisun, who
was summoned to the Wilson house on
thf- night of the shooting, was the first
witness, and told briefly (rf the condi
tion of th>- body when he arrived there,
and cÂ»f the cause of death.
Mrs. Lucy Owens, who was Wilson's
housekeeper, then took the stand, and
there was a general craning of necks to
get a food view of thg woman who saw
the old man fall dead at her feet on his
own doorstep, and who was herself one
of the first to be suspected of the mur
der. Mrs. Owens told a very circum-
Btantial story of the events that trans
pired on the Wilson ranch on the af
ternoon and the evening of the murder.
She repeated the story of the shooting
of the old rancher by the unknown as
aasslon, as he stood on th^ doorstep c-f
his house, and how she stood just in the
doorway and saw him fall dead. She
described the terror of herself and her
niece, Ada Rice, who was stopping with
her, and how, after calling vainly for
help, they climbed through the window
of thfir room and ran to the Hatch
ranch and gave the alarm.
Mrs. Owens denied that she had ever
heard Wilson say he intended to deed
the ranch to Vlrgie O'Briea. She knew
however, the O'Brien woman was to
supersede her as housekeeper on the
Sunday following.
Ada Rice, a stunning blonde, neatly
dressed in a tailor-made suit of some
blue material, was the next witness.
She confessed IS years, but looked sev
eral years older. She claimed San Fran
cisco as hr>r home and gave her occu
pation as that of a nursegirl. Miss Rice
corroborated her aunt in every particu
lar, and in addition testified that while
Mr?. Owens was out at the pump she
heard the elicfc of a gun almost under
her window and saw the shadow of a
man through the glass. She was ter
rified by the occurrence and sat up in
bed waiting for her aunt to return.
Then she heard the fatal shot fired.
Daniel M. Wilson, son of the mur
dered rancher, took Miss Rice's place
on the stand. Young Wilson is 18 years
old and appeared to think he was one
of the chief attractions at a minstrel
performance rather than a witness
against his mother and grandmother,
who were on trial for their lives for
the murder of his father. His tes
timony amounted to little, but his an
tics, while they caused the spectators
to laugh, seemed slightly out uf plate.
He admitted having told his mother
some time before the murder that his
father had promised to deed the home
place to Virgie O'Brien and she re
plied:
"It looks to me as though you had
Just as good a right to the property as
Virgie O'Brien."
He could not say whether or not his
grandmother was present at that in
terview. He had told his father he did
not think it was right to give the prop
erty to the O'Brien woman.
Mrs. Lillle Bailard, daughter of Dan
Wilson, who was living with her mother
on the McEwen ranch when her father
was killed, was expected to give some
damaging testimony against her
mother, but the expectation was not
realized, asÂ»her testimony was of no
particular value to either side.
G. A. Bailard testified that just before
he started on * camping trip with Dan
Wilson, a few weeks before the murder,
Mrs. Wilson said to him:
â¢Wilson will be fixed pretty dâ n
quick. The neighbors will take a
band."
The spectators, pricked up their ears
and the young witness appeared to
hugely enjoy the notoriety he had sud
! denly attained. He was evidently pre
| pared to tell of other conversations, but
Attorney George Lamont pricked the
bubble of his importance by forcing him
to admit that the remark quoted was
made while discussing Wilson's flag
rant immoralities and the, feeling in the
neighborhood caused by his doings.
Sam Riley testified that he was- en
gaged by William Craig to take the lat
ter's place in the Callender stable at
Vallejo on October 9, 1896, while Craig
went to San Francisco.
"At about 5:30 in the afternoon," said
Riley, "a man came in and wanted a
rig. I hitched up a horse in an open
road wagon and he got in and drove
off. I asked him when he asked for the
rig where he wanted to go, and he said,
â¢To take a little drive. 1 "
"Have you seen that man since?"
asked District Attorney Devlin. ?
"Yes; about two weeks after the
murder. City Marshal Savage of Valle
jo, the present Sheriff, came to me and
asked me if I could recognize the man
who hired the rig that night. I told
him I could. A few days later I saw
Miller at the Vallejo crossing and
pointed him out to Mr. Savage."
"Do you see the man in this room?"
"Yea; that is the man," replied
Riley, indicating Miller.
"Are you positive?"
"As positive as a man can be."
The witness said that Craig returned
at 7:30 and asked him to stay a while
longer, as he (Craig) wanted to at
tend a "blowout" being given that
night by the Neptune Firemen, of
which he was a member. He <}'d so,
and when Craig came back about 11
o'clock he decided to stay all night. He
and Craig slept together, and when Mil
ler came back with the rig at about 5:30
in the morning Craig unhitched the
horse and put him away. Riley did not
see Miller at that time.
William Craig testified to having
hired Riley to take his place in the
stable for a day and gave uncon
trovertible reasons for fixing the date
at Friday, October 9. He said that
when Miller brought the rig back Miller
stepped out of the bugggy directly in
front of him, but as he had the collar
of his coat turned up and his hat pulled
down over his eyes he could only sec. a
small portion of the mans features.
The fellow had a scar or scratch on his
right cheek. He was asked if he
could identify Miller a? the man.
"He looks very much like him." said
Craig, " "but I did not see much of his
face and I could not swear to it."
Miller was asked to put his hat on.
which he did, setting it far back on his
head.
"Pull it down over your eyes." said
Craig. "Further â now, that'|i it. Now
hold you hand over your chin so I can
just see your nose and mouth."
Miller complied and the moment h j
did so the witness exclaimed:
"I am almost positive that is the
man,"
Craig testified that the horse driven
by tho man alleged to have been
Miller mi the night of October 8 was
badly used up from hard driving and
could not be used agate for several
days. He had not seen Miller at tho
stable on the following Sunday, when
the latter claims to have hired a rig
there, although he was there attending:
to his duties all day. He was positive
Miller got no rig there on that day.
Mrs. Mary Hayes of Vallejo said shf
was awakened between 5:30 and 6
o'clock on the morning of October 10,
1*96, by an explosion. She looked out
of her window and saw through the
open kitchen door of Miller's residence,
which was next door, the flames from
a gasoline stove, which had exploded.
A moment later Miller came out into
the yard, carrying the stove. He wore
a long overcoat at the time. On thÂ£
Sunday after the murder she heard
Miller and his wife talking In the yard.
Miller said, addressing his wife:
"I would like to go up to see Addie."
Mrs. Miller replied: "It seems to me
you take an awful lot of interest in her.
Let her get out of the trouble the way
she got into it."
On another occasion she heard Miller
tell his wife the officers were watching
him, and he "hoped they would not put
his mother in jail and feed her on bread
and water until'she told all she knew."
On cross-examination the witness tes
tified that Miller's house and that of
her mother, where he lived, were sep
arated by about twenty-five feet.
Ferdinand J- Bendel, who was report
ed to have said that Miller told him he
was obliged to kill Wilson in order to
save the property, was one of those
who "fell down" when put to the test.
George Hughes testified to a wrangle
between Miller and Mrs. Wilson while
the latter was living on the Wilson
ranch after the murder, in which Mil
ler accused his sister and niece of hav
ing caused Wilson's death, and Lily
replied:
"If the truth was known, you are the
one who shot him."
Hughes' testimony, however, is no
longer given the importance it was at
first credited with.
Mrs. Eliza Sheehan was called by the
defense. She and her two daughters
gave testimony supporting the Miller
alibi.
The defense closed with the Shee
hans, and District Attorney Devlin,
addressing the court, said twenty-five
witnesses had been examined, and that
while some of the evidence that was
exported to be produced had failed to
materialize, some strong testimony
tending to show the guilt of the prison
ers had been given, p- well as testi
mony in their defense. He wanted time
to fully consider the evidence offered
before making a motion to either com
mit the defendants or discharge them,
and he. therefore, moved that the case
be continued until 10 o'clock to
morrow morning. .

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1899.
GOLD FOUND ON
CLOCOHENE RIVER
New Fields Opened in
Alaska.
PROSPECTOR'S GLOWING TALE
GRAVEL BARS FLAKED WITH
YELLOW METAL.
Driven by Water From a Promising
Prospect Hole, but Will
Return to Work His
Find.
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Jan. 15.â A man
has been found by S. O. Wheelock of
Juneau who has discovered gold on the
Clocoherve River, a tributary of the
Taku, aiong which for a considerable
length runs the Taku trail to Atlin.
He is P. R. McGuire, formerly a Mon
tana miner. He has been at work this
winter at the Treadwell mine, and last
summer prospected around the Taku
during June and July, the high water
months, when the snow melts most rap
idly. â¢ 4
The latest maps issued by the Land
Department of the Government show
this river to be named Slocoh, but on
most maps and in Alaska the name is
Clocohene. The river is about, fifty
miles long and heads up into a lake of
considerable size and of the same name.
This lake is only about ten miles from
the lower end of Atlin. The Indians
have a summer trail up the Clocohene,
and as it is much shorter than up the
Silver Salmon and down Pike River it
is thought this will be the trail next
summer. The Clocohene comes in al
most opposite the Inklin, which, with
the Nakina. forms the Taku River. The
present trail goes up the Nakina to the
Silver Salmon. Water drove McGuire
out of his prospect hole, but he is go
ing to try it again this winter while
all the fresh water in Alaska is asleep
in its valley cradles. Mr. McGuire
said:
'The trouble about prospecting those
bars in the summer time is the water.
If you sink a hole and leave it, for in
stance, half an hour you will find it full
of water. You can't see where it
comes from, except that it must come
from the ground, and you may be half
a mile away from the stream. Some
prospecting has been done up the Taku,
but nearly everybody has gone to the
right up the Inklin River. Last sum
mer I thought I would go to the left
and so followed up the Clocohene. I
went to work on a bar and got from 100
to 150 colors to the pan. I aid nÂ«t get
to bedrock on account of the water. I
am going up there this winter and try
it in a different way. Two of us ex
pect to start up the Taku in about ten
days and prospect along that way. We
are going up the Clocohene instead of
the Silver Salmon, and will take horso?.
I am, going to rut woodjt build a fite on
the Clocohene, thaw out the ground and
go down to bedrock. If we find pay
dirt at bedrock we can drift, and in the
winter time the water does not bother
us."
Some Germans found a promising
prospect last season up on a creek
which empties into the Inklin. While
there has always been some travel by
the Taku trail to the interior, and chief
ly by Indians, the crowds that are go
ing in that way are expected to find
new placer diggings in that section.
Pioneer prospectors and citizens of Ju
neau have always expected something
to be found up the Taku. One hundred
to ir>o colors to the pan means 2 or 3
cents, and it is generally considered
among miners a very encouraging sur
face prospect.
DEBATE ON ARMY
REORGANIZATION BILL
Final Vote on^the Measure Will Be
Taken Next Tuesday After
noon.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â The debate
on the army reorganization bill opened
In the House to-day under an agreement
by â which the general debate is to run
fifteen hours, exclusive of three night
sessions, the final vote to be taken not
later than 3 o'clock next Tuesday. Prac
tically three propositions are before the
House, the House bill providing for a
standing army of 100.000 men: the minor
ity substitute increasing the standing
army to 30. 000 men and lodging with the
President discretionary power to call out
50,000 volunteers for emergency service and
a proposition to continue temporarily the
regular army at its present war strengthâ
C 2.000 men. Tt is also understood that
Marsh iR.t t.f Illinois will champion the
Miles bill. Among the supporters of the
majority bill there are those who, like
MeClellan (D.) of New York, a son of
General George B. McClellan, favor a
provision for a general staff made up of
officers of the line, so as to make the
army organization responsible to a single
head. The fate of the measure is still
considered doubtful, although Chairman
Hull and his friends profess great confi
dence in its passage. The debate to-day
was not exciting.
TRIAL OF GENERAL
EAGAN BEGINS TO-DAY
Will Probably Plead Not Guilty, and
Then Urge That His Lan
guage Was Justifiable.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 24.â General Mer
ritt and most of the members of the
court-martial which will hear the charges
against general Eagan are In the city.
The court meets at the Ebbitt House to
morrow morning, and it Is not expected
that more than two or three days will be
ii. i essafy to complete its work.
General Eagan will plead not guilty in
a general way. and then he probably will
enter the plea of Justification. This ac
tion is customary in cases of this char
acter, but it rests with the court alone
whether or not the plea will he allowed.
It ifl not likely that it will be denied Gen
oral Eagan.
Judge Advocate Davis said to-day that
he expects to hnve no difficulty in prov
ing that General Eagan made the state
ment in the specifications before Che War
Commission, even If he cannot produce
the original <ype-written statement read
by the accused or obtain one of the copies
of it given out by General Eagan.
"The War Commissioners have ears,"
said he. "and heard the statement read."
Colonel Davis said that he would call
very few witnesses, because there is no
necessity for a large number.

ANXIETY AS TO
HAWAII BILL
I
Poor Prospect for Island
Legislation.
CROWDED BY OTHER MATTERS
CHINESE IMMIGRATION CAUSES
APPREHENSION.
Since the Decision of the Supreme
. Court of Hawaii the Subject
Is Left ' All in a
Jumble.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON Jan. 24.â The sup
porters in the Senate of the bill for the
government of the Hawaiian Islands as
a territory of the United States are
growing somewhat anxious over the
prospect. In view of the crowded con
dition of the calendar and the apparent
indifference toward Hawaiian legisla
tion, they express the fear that the bill
may not receive attention before ad
journment, and they say if it does not
there will be a most perplexing condi
tion of affairs in the islands, which be
came a part of the Union by the adop
tion of the Newlands resolution in
July last.
The decision of the Supreme Court of
Hawaii in the matter of the landing of
Chinese immigrants in the islands is
the immediate cause of the present ap
prehension. The full text of this de
cision has now been received in Wash
ington and it is found to be very far
reaching in its effect. It deals not only
with the landing of Chinese in Hawaii,
but also incidentally lays down the
doctrine that it is, as a court, without
jurisdiction in construing laws of the
United States dealing with other than
the Chinese immigration question.
Discussing this phase of the Ha
waiian question Senator Cullom, who
has charge of the general bill, said to
day that the decision left the people
of the islands in a most unsatisfactory
predicament.
"They do not know where they
stand," he said, "nor what to depend
on in the enforcement of the law. Im
portant legal questions are likely to
arise at any time, and naturally the
Hawaiians want to know where they
stand."
Continuing:. Senator Cullom said he
would call up the Hawaiian bill as soon
as there seemed any possibility of get
ting consideration, but so long as the
peace treaty maintained Hr present
position it was impossible for him to
say when this would be.
Inquiry develops the fact that there
would be opposition to the Hawaiian
bill in Its present shape, and some
Senators hesitate to act in this matter
until there are further developments
with reference to Cuba, Porto Rico and
the Philippines. There is a feeling
among Senators of this class that any
legislation In the interests of Hawaii
will be taken as a precedent for the
other islands, and that hence the Ha
waiian question should he postponed
until the legislation for all the new ac
quisitions can be considered together.
The Hawaiian advocates contend,
however, that that territory constitutes
a class of its own. and they are urging
action at the present session as a right
which Hawaii can assert now regard
less of any other section. They con
tend that the Chinese decision accen
tuates this right and makes the ques
tion one of such weight that it cannot
be postponed. The point is made that
under the decision of the Hawaiian
court it could not take cognizance of
the questions arising under our consti
tution nor of admiralty cases, and
hence great confusion is probable until
our laws are extended to the islands.

FUGITIVE YOUNG
STILL AT LARGE
Vain Search for the Al
leged Firebug.
HIS WIFE ILL IN PRISON
REFUSES TO PARTAKE OF FOOD
OR MEDICINE.
Asserts That She Is Being Perse
cuted and That She Cares
Not What Is Done
With Her.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 24.â The flight of
Henry Young, the alleged firebug of
Tiburon, and the arrest of his wife,
Mrs. Augusta Young, on a charge of
arson, form the sole topic of conversa
tion in this city and the place where the
crime was committed. There are few
who do not also criticize in unmeasured
terms the reduction of the missing
man's bail and the suspicious circum
stances attending the affair.
Both in San Francisco and in Ala
meda, where Albert C. Walsshow, the
defendant's brother in law, resides, the
police have descriptions of Young and
are endeavoring to discover his where
abouts. Constable Lewis Hughes went
to the metropolis in quest of him to
day, but nothing in the way of a clew
regarding his hiding place has yet ap
peared. It is believed by the authori
ties that Young intended to stand trial
until the evidence of his wife's alleged
complicity was published in The Call.
Mrs. Young lay in bed in her cell all
day, playing the role of martyr. She
refused a pillow on which to lay her
head, and even while admitting that
she was cold on the previous night
would not state whether or not addi
tional blankets would be welcome. She
told Sheriff Taylor that the last thing
she ever expected of her husband was
to desert her.
"Don't let anybody come to see me,"
she requested; "I am disgraced and
don't care if I am sent to San Quentin.
If they let me out of here it will be
only two days until I do something to
make them place me back again." |
The pretty little prisoner is suffering
from a slight attack of la grippe, but

herself. She ate nothing all day. but
announced her intention to partake of
good meals to-morrow in order to be
strong enough to stand the preliminary
examination next Thursday. Delicate
and apathetic as she is. this little wo
man can "show her teeth" at times.
"I will eat heartily to-morrow," she
declared, with face set and hardened
as she rose on one elbow, "and I will
go before those Tiburnn people and
show them my scorn. They are per
secuting me, but they shall see that
for them I have only a feeling- of unut
terable contempt."
SUPPORT OF PROPOSED
ANTARCTIC EXPLORATION
Berlin Statesmen Think That Ger-
many. Great Britain and the
United States Should
Act Together.
BKRLIX. Jan. 4.â The Minister of the
Interior, Count Pcsadowski-Wehner. in
the course of the debate on the Home Of
fice estimates in the Reichstag to-day,
said that Prince Hohenlohe, the imperial
Chancellor, was prepared to support the
proposed Antarctic exploration. If the
expedition proposed starting in 1901 the
Minister said a decision on the subject
must speedily be taken in regard to grant
ing funds from the imperial treasury, as
it will take two years to construct a ship,
whose cost will be about 1,000,000 marks.
Count Posadowski-Wehner also ex
pressed the belief that Germany, the
United States and Great Britain should
act conjointly in the matter.
Salmon in Monterey Bay.
MONTEREY, Jan. 24.â Tho exception
ally large run of sardines In this bay of
late 'has brought in large numbers of sal
mon whose prey the sardines are. These
fine fish are so plentiful in the bay. and
especially about the Monterey fishing
grounds, that they are being caught from
the different in wharves with hook and
line, and every morning for the past
week fishing boats have come in with big
catches. Large quantities of both salmon
and sardines are being daily shipped to
San. Francisco and other markets. The
report comes here from Moss Landing
that for the first time in twenty years
salmon are running up the Salinas River.
This is regarded by the Monterey fisher
men as a phenomenon:

Investigating Commission . to-day that he
had constantly inspected the kitchens and

INTERESTS THE COAST.
Colonel Chittenden's Reservoir Pro-
ject Finds Favor.
WASHINGTON, D. C, Jan. 24.-The de
mand was so great for the report of Col
onel Hiram M. Chlttenden on surveys for
reservoir sites that the first edition has
been entirely exhausted. A second edi
tion of 3000 copes is now being printed.
Those who want a copy should make their
application at once to some member or
Congress. This is the report in which It
was recommended that the Federal Gov
ernment should build storage reservoirs
as part of its policy of internal improve
ment to reinforce the natural flow of
streams, the Federal Government reserv
ing control of the reservoir and making
no charge for the use of the water, but
allowing it to be distributed under the
laws of the State. George H. Maxwell of
San Francisco, who is in Washington as
a representative of the Irrigation Con
gress says an effort will be made to get
from this Congress an appropriation to
build one of the reservoirs surveyed by
Colonel Chittenden. A number of v\ estern
Senators, especially Senator Warren of
Wyoming and the California Senators,
are much interested in the matter and
will use every effort to secure the appro
priation.

Abalone Fishing at Monterey.
MONTEREY, Jan. 24. â The Japanese
fishing company of this place has begun
a new line, of Industry of late and is mak
ing considerable money out of it. The
fishermen have set up a camp on Carmel
Bay, about six miles from Monterey, and
are employing two small boats" crews in
catching abalones. The Japanese are es
pecially successful at this, as they have
several expert divers, who spend most of
their time in the water diving for the
deep sea abalone. They can the abalonc
meat and sell the shells to curio dealers.
Often small pearls of some value are
found, in the shells, and these are shipped
to Japan, where they find a ready market.
Carmel Bay is full of the finer kind of
abalones and fhe catches are always good
on that ground.
More Dunham Suspects.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 24.â The Sheriffs office
Is beingr deluged with letters and photo

plain that neither suspect is the man
â¢wanted. Sheriff Langford is still in a
quandary about the Burlingrton. la., sus
pect. Earl Parr is due from lowa on any

be determined whether it is necessary to

as they were a week ago.

Mystery Still Cloaks
Bragger's Death,
OFFICIALS ARE NOT ACTIVE

CORONER'S JT7RY.
Old Ferryman Said to Have Died of
Natural Causes, but the Cir
cumstances Indicate
Murder.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX ANDREAS, Jan. 24.â The death
of Jacob Bragger at Reynolds Ferry on
Sunday night is still shrouded in mys
tery. An inquest was held last even
ing at the scene of the possible crime,
and a verdict of death from natural
causes brought in. At this point the
officials rest. An examination of the
body and premises was made by The
Call correspondent, and there seems to
be more reason in the theory of murder
than in that of natural death. The
blow on top of the head is in such a
position that it would have been almost
impossible to be inflicted by a fall un
less the body were precipitated over a
precipice. Th* body was discovered in
a position that would be perfectly
natural for one to fall into after having
been struck on the head.
That the old man feared violent death
is evident. He had expressed such a
fear to his nieces, Mrs. Carrie Sherman
of Chicago and Miss Minnie Turner of
St. Louis, who had visited him at the
time of the Midwinter Fair. The ladies
had told of this fear while visiting a
neighbor.
The murder theory is strengthened
by the fact that two old-fashioned caD
and ball pistols and a muzzle-loading
shotgun were found within easy reach
of Bragger as he lay upon his bed.
The old man must have had money
on the premises, as he owned a vine
yard and manufactured a large quan
tity of wine each season. This he re
tailed, and as he had carried on this
business for a number of years and
was never known to send money to a
bank, he must have had a large sum in
hidin. . The officials in searching the
house found but $8 35 In coin and about
$10 in gold dust.
No autopsy will he held to ascertain
whether death resulted from natural
causes or concussion of the brain,
which the blow causing the wound on
the top of the head could have pro
duced

AGONCILLO POSES AS
A FILIPINO PROPHET
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â 1n a com
munication to the Secretary of State
â to-day Senor Agoncillo calls attention
to the fact that on January 11 he ad
sed a letter to him upon the ques
tion of recognition, forwarding with it
a memorandum demonstrating that, ac
cording to all American precedents, the
Philippine republic was entitled to
irnition, and in the same letter In
vited the attention of the Secretary to
the present strained conditions at Man
ila, where over-zeal on either side
might create a condition resulting in
grievous loss of life, and urging the
necessity of an early and frank com
munication between the representatives
of the two countries. He further calls
attention to the fact that since his let
ter was written the very circumstances
"he feared have brought the two coun
tries to the edge of war, and says tliat
: the language used by him was so pro-
phetii'. that subsequent facts have am
ply justified its emp' yment. He now
desires to call the attention of the Sec
retary to certain conditions which, in
his opinion, require immediate allevia
tion. There are, he says, at the present
time, 20,000 American troops at Manila
controlling a population of about 300,-
A number of war vessels are sta
â¢ tkmed in the harbor, and many other
American men-of-war and transports
â ire to be found within the archipelago,
although the actual possession of the
.American troops extends over not to
, exceed 143 square miles out of more
'â¢i- tfea.n 200,000.
â¢.:". Despite the enormous forces now in
this extremely circumscribed area, "We
. -arf informed through the public prints
:that other vessels of war have been
: .ordered from distant parts of the globe
vt' v reinforce those now among the isl
;â â ';â¢ ands in question, while a few days ago
a- transport sailed from New York City
,-. â¢â¢;â " carrying about 2000 soldiers, and hay-
Ving Manila as a destination, and as we
are further informed regiments of
'.'â ': troops are under orders to proceed by
way of San Francisco to the Philip
pines. The public prints inform us that
an attack is contemplated upon the
. Philippine Islands; the islands to be
taken in detail, the smaller ones first,
tht? larger ones blockaded so that they
.may not assist those first attacked."
He says it is naturally the impression
of his government and people that these
"warlike preparations indicate existing
nr immediate military operations in the
Orient, and they readily conceive that
It must be contemplated that such oper
ations are to be leveled at the existing
government of the Philippines.
"As the representative of the Phil
ippine government," he continues, "I
tate to give acceptance to this idea,
ter I cannot believe that there is any
present or future difficulty between the
American and Philippine governments
. justifying warlike activity."
He points out the fact that but lately
tlie United States and Philippine gov
ernments have been associated in a.
'.-.conflict against a common enemy, the
United States accomplishing its purpose
â¢by the expulsion of Spain from the
'.â¢WÂ«B.t Indies, while the desire of the
Philippine republic has been practically
attained by the almost complete ex
pulsion of the Spanish from the Philip
pine Islands; the Philippine govern
ment now holding as prisoners of war
between 9000 and 10,000 Spanish soldiers
and the Spanish possessing only a few
small garrisons in isolated points of
minor importance. He is therefore un-

SENT FREE TO MEN
The State Medioal Institut) Discovers a
Bemarkable Remedy for Lost
Vigor.
ARE SENDING FREE A TRIAL PACKAGE
TO ALL WHO WRITE.
â â  â¢ Free samples of a most remarkable
remedy are being distributed by the State
Medical Institute. Fort Wayne, Ind. It
cured so many men who had battled for
â¢years against the mental and physical
guff-erlng of lost manhood that the insti-
tute" has decided to distribute free trial
"packages to all who write. It is a home
treatment and all men who suffer with
: any foiin of sexual weakness, resulting
from youthful folly, premature loss of
strength and memory, weak back, varico-
cele or emaciation of parts can now cure
tnemselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful
effect of warmth and seems to act direct
to the desired location giving strength
and development just where it is needed.
It cures all the ills and troubles that come
from years of misuse of the natural func-
tions and has been an absolute success
:in all cases. A request to the State Med-
ical Institute. 193 First National Bank
building, Fort Wayne Ind.. stating that
. you desire one of their free trial pack-
ages will be complied with. The institute
is desirous of reaching that great class
of men who are unable to leave home to
be treated and the free sample will en-
able them to see how easy it is to be
cured of sexual weakness when the
" proper remedies are employed. The in-

able to conceive any reason why the
armies and navies of the United States,
lately employed against a common
enemy, should be turned against
America's recent associate.
The United States, he says, has no
active enemy in the Orient, having
proclaimed an armistice with Spain. It
is true, he continues, that Spain has
undertaken to convey to the United
States its alleged claim against the
Philippines, a claim which Spain -was
not capable of enforcing and whfeh
never found its origin in the consent of
the people of those islands. He in
quires: "Are my government and peo
ple to be left to suppose that it is be
cause of some desire on the part of the |
American Government to enforce I
against its late associate this exploded
claim that the United States Is massing
its forces at the late capital of the
Philippine Islands?"
He points out that the Philippines i
are in a state of order, possessing a I
government satisfactory to their in- !
habitants, and without an enemy
within their borders offering any re
sistance to its operations and at peace
with all the world. He is sure the Sec
retary of State will appreciate, in view
of the circumstances, as detailed, the
quietin^ reassuring effect upon the
minds of his countrymen to result from
a disclaimer upon the part of the
American Government of any inten
tion to attack their liberties and inde
pendence. He continues that, not- |
withstanding the difficutly he labors ;
under in not having been formally re-.
ceived, he finds it his imperative duty '
to call the attention of the Secretary to '
the disturbing facts enumerated to the ;
end that he may receive such assur- !
ances as will satisfy his Government
that it is not the intention of America '
to make war upon th<> new republic of i
Asia, and which will explain to it the !
reason why large armies and navies
phould be dispatched to the Philip
pines Islands, and which will relieve his
countrymen of the fear that now pos
sesses them, that their liberties are in
danger at the hands of a republic i
whose name they have always believed
AN HONORED CAREER
HAS REACHED ITS END
Dr. James F, Sullivan Dies at His Home
in This City*
DR. JAMES F. SULLIVAN, one of the most widely known and highly
respected physicians of this city, is dead. The end to an honorable
career came after a short illness, contracted in the physician's de
votion to duty. Something over a month ago Dr. Sullivan, while ill
himself, received an ur- ?nt call from a patient. The physician re
sponded. He ministered to his patient until danger was over, and then re
turned to his home to a bed of dangerous illness, which he never left
alive. Pneumonia was added to a complication of diseases, and yesterday
morning the physician, surrounded by his wife and children, expired.
Everything possible had been done but without avail. Drs. Henry Gib
bons, Pawlicki, Kerr, Cheney and Stillman were called in, but their ser
vice^ were in vain. The dying physician was past the point of revival,
and early yesterday morning the end came. Dr. Sullivan will be buried
from his late home, 1105 Van Ness avenue, to-morrow morning. Funeral
services will be held at 10 o'clock at St. Mary's Cathedral, where a solemn
high requiem mass will be celebrated. Interment will be at Calvary Ceme
tery.
In an Honored life of over twenty-four years in this city Dr. Sullivan
earned the friendship and the well wishes of thousands of men and women.
He was known pre-eminently as the physician of the poor, as it was said
of him that he gave his marked abilities to the poor and never took a
poor man's money. The dead physician was born on May 18, 1838, at i:ox
bury, Massachusetts. His father was the owner of one of the largest paper
manufactories in Massachusetts, and for a time owned the only establish
ment of its sort in New England.

Dr. Sullivan graduated with honors from Harvard University. He then
spent three years of a post-graduate course in the colleges and hospitals
of London, Paris and Dublin. It was his purpose to devote five years to Euro
pean study, but the Civil War broke out and he deemed it his duty to re
turn to his native country at once. In 1562 he returned to Boston and
enlisted as surgeon of the Ninth Massachusetts Regiment with the Army
of the Potomac.
Dr. Sullivan passed' with distinguished service through the War of the
Rebellion. He was in twenty-seven battles, and became, in honor of his
heroism, a surgeon major. Surgeon General Dale of the Federal army de
clared that the young physician had served with credit to himself and
honor to his State. At the conclusion of the war Dr. Sullivan went to
Chicago, where he practiced his profession for eleven years. In 1875 he
came to this city with a hope that a change would benefit the health of
his wife.
Since 1875 Dr. Sullivan practiced his profession continuously in this
city. He was esteemed as one of tne most conservative and learned phy-
Bicians in the State. Time and again he was offered posts of honor in local
hospitals and colleges, but invariably declined, as he preferred to give his
undivided attention to his practice. Dr. Sullivan leaves a wife and five
childrenâ three sons and two daughters. One of the sons Is Dr. William
N. Sullivan, who has already won the reputation of being one of the most
promising of the younger physicians of the city.

LONDON JUNTA TRIES
TO AVOID HOSTILITIES
LONDON, Jan. 24.â The Filipino
Junta here to-day received a cable mes
sage from Agoncillo, Aguinaldo's rep
resentative at Washington, declaring
that the prospects were improving,
though the work was difficult.
The absence of direct news from Ma
nila and the receipt of secret intelli
gence from Washington is causing the
gravest anxiety among the Filipinos
here. The arrests of Filipinos by Major
General Otis and the news that num
bers of Filipinos have fled is regarded
as a most serious occurrence. It is
pointed out by the Filipinos that this
is exactly what happened in 1896 under
General Blanco, when the Filipinos, on
the following day, attacked the Span
iards and the revolution broke out.
Members of the Filipino junta in this
city say they are so anxious to avert
war that they are cabling Manila to
day urging the Filipinos "not to start
hostilities if there is the remotest pos
sibility of averting trouble."
SPANIARDS SLAUGHTERED
ON ISLAND OF BALABAC
LABUAN. British Borneo, Jan. 24.â
The steamer Labuan, Captain Pfort,
which has arrived here, came from the
island of Balabac, thirty miles south of
Palawan, Philippine Islands, and not
from Palawan, as previously reported.
The murder of Spanish officers which
she reported occurred at Balabac. The
Labuan brought sixty- five women and
children here. They had been robbed of
everything, but otherwise had not been
ill-treated. The Sulus assisted the Bala
bacs in killing the Spanish officers. The
Spaniards left Palawan, where the na
tives were fearful of the Sulus. Stores
had been looted, business was at a
standstill, and the natives were armed
and ready for mischief.
A dispatch frpm Madrid on January 3
said General Rlos, the Spanish com
mander in the Philippines, had cabled
from Manila confirming the report that
all the Spaniards at Balabac had been
massacred with the exception of the
women, whose release was being asked
for.
The Madrid correspondent of the
Daily Mail of London telegraphed from
Madrid the same day that in the rebel
lion at Balabac Naval Lieutenant Bel
lamy was beheaded and that the rebels
also murdered a doctor and several
other Europeans. A gunboat was also
said to have fired on the rebels. Its
commander was unable to effect the re
lease of the women.
SICK AND MAIMED
PRISONERS RELEASED
MADRID, Jan. 24.â A dispatch from
Hongkong to the Reforma of this city
â ays a letter received from the Philip
pine Islands, under date of January 20,
announces that the rupture between
the Filipinos and the Americans is an
accomplished fact, and that the lives of
the Spaniards in the Archipelago are
endangered.
The Minister of War, General Corriea,
has received a cable dispatch from Gen
eral Rios, the Spanish commander in
the Philippines, announcing that all the
sick and maimed civilians and military
prisoners were released by the Filipinos
to-day. The general added that he
hoped the remainder of the prisoners
will be liberated shortly.
SENATORS ARGUE ON
THE TREATY OF PEACE
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â The Senate
resumed consideration of the peace
treaty in executive session to-day. The
Berry resolution for the consideration
of the treaty in open session was voted
down without a rollcall.
Probably the most significant occur
rence of the session was the banter
upon the question of a final vote upon
the treaty itself. Senators Gorman and
Vest, both of whom oppose ratification,
urged the Importance of getting a vote
at no very distant day. Senator Gor
man, in a brief but earnest address,
said that much had been said by the
friends of ratification as to the neces
sity of disposing of the subject without
any great delay. He agreed with them
on that point, and if they were in ear
nest he felt that a vote might be reach
ed within ten days.
Senator Vest joined to Gorman's ap
peal and urged Davis to name a day
and an hour when the vote could be
taken.
"We want it understood distinctly,"
he said, "that we are not holding the
treaty up at all. Name the day. We
will agree to any date that will suit
you. If you have the vote you can
ratify your treaty; if not, it will be
defeated. The question will be disposed
of and the Senate can proceed with
other business."
"Let us vote now," responded Sena
tor AldricH, who had just entered the
chamber after a visit to his home in
Rhoq> Island. "We ought to be ready
to vote in fifteen minutes."
Senator Davis replied, however, that
the question of fixing A day for the
vote had not been considered by the
Committee on Foreign Relations, and
that he would not feel justified in as
suming such a responsibility upon his
own authority until supported by the
action of his committee. He promised
to bring the matter to the attention of
the commltttee at its next session.
The principal speeches of the general
debate were made for the treaty by
Senators Teller and Frye and by Sena
tor Hoar in opposition. Senator Frye's
remarks were a sharp criticism of the
opposing Senators and it was so pointed
that it brought Senator Hoar to his
feet for a somewhat acrimonious reply.
Frye dwelt at some length upon the
conditions under which the treaty had
been formulated, and also referred to
the situation in the Philippines, inti
mating that the opposition to ratifica
tion was the principal source of en
couragement to the Filipinos in their
present attitude toward the United
States. Hoar defended the course of
the opposition. Disagreeable as it was,
he said, to arouse the ill-will of his
brother Senators, that condition was
preferable to plunging the country into
a position that might be of untold con
sequence to the whole nation.
Teller replied to Hoar, saying the op
position were responsible for the con
tinuation of the state of war and point
ing out various probable results in the
way of loss of prestige and power in
case the United States should fail to
take advantage of the opportunity
which It afforded to assert her rightful
place as one of the nations of the world,
of commanding and paramount in
fluence.
IMPARCIAL'S IDtA
OF THE SITUATION
MADRID, Jan. 24.â The Imparcial to
day says: All the intelligence from the
Philippine Islands shows that the
Americans recognize their inability to
overcome the insurgents in the island
of Luzon and the Yisayas. The Fili
pinos understand that the Americans
wish to tyrannize over them and ex
ploit them as the Spaniards never did.
The Americans intended to exercise
their power merely at the important
posts, but they are already convinced
that such a domination would not be
efficacious. They would be constantly
fighting the insurgents and the latter
would soon put an end to the Ameri
cans, as the Filipinos have on their
side not only bullets, but the climp.te
and the enormous expenditure which
the situation will entail on the Ameri
cans. This explains Washington's de
sire to first get the treaty of Paris
voted and then open negotiations with
the rebel chiefs in order to see if Agui
nalda and his colleagues will consent
at least to accept an American pro
tectorate with self.-government.
TWO NOTABLE SPEECHES
ON EXPANSION POLICY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.â Two nota
ble speeches were delivered in the
Senate to-day, one by Lodge of Massa
chusetts and the other by Clay of
Georgia. While the twu Senators dif
fered dimetrically as to the policy of
expansion, upon which they dwelt, both
are in favor of the immediate ratifica
tion of the pending peace treaty. They
contend that once the treaty is ratified,
Congress will have full power to deal
with conditions respecting the territory
acquired during the war with Spain
and not before. Lodge particularly
argued for a formal declaration of
peace, which could be had only by the
ratification of the treaty.

THE CITY HALL PAKK fIND THE
PANHANDLE.
AMONG the improvements proposed in the city
are two which, while they have hitherto been
considered separately, bear such a relation to
one another they might be combined as a compre
hensive scheme for making a more beautiful San
Francisco. These are the suggested plans of purchas
ing the blocks of land interposed between the City
Hall and Market street so as to form a park front
for that edifice, and the extension of the panhandle
of Golden Gate Park to Van Ness avenue.
Either of these improvements carried out separately
would of course add much to the beauty of the city,
but if both were accomplished the value of each would
be increased. The one would provide our principal
thoroughfare with a handsome park, across which
could be seen the stately and picturesque facade of the
City Hall, and the other, at a point not far distant,
would open a grand driveway through a park-like ex
tension to the Golden Gate Park itself. The continuity
and monotony of shops along Market street would
thus be broken in an impressive way and the magni
ficence of the avenue greatly increased.
Of the two projects, that of redeeming the City Hall
Park is the more desirable. At present the most im
portant and most superb of our civic edifices is vir
tually upon a back street, and our great central
avenue of traffic is unadorned by any stately public
building or open square. The beamy conferred upon
Broadway, New York, by Bowling Green, City Hall
square and Union square is remarked by every visitor
to the city. Their expanses of green grass, their
fountains, their trees and their statues give a certain
grace and dignity to what would be otherwise only a
long row of shops.
Market street ought to be as attractive as Broad
way, but it will never be so unless it is in some mea
sure adorned by parks, and no other point along its
entire length is so fitted for park purposes as the
area in front of the City Hall.
At the present time the buildings upon the lots in
front of the hall are comparatively slight and their
purchase would not entail much cost, nor their de
struction much loss. The land itself can certainly be
purchased more cheaply now than will be possible at
any time in the future. This, therefore, is the time
to undertake the improvement. Any plan for
beautifying San Francisco which does not include
the opening of the City Hall park can hardly be ac
ceptable to the intelligence of the citizens.
Gunst testified that Colonel Preston was playing a
nickel-in-the-slot machine at the time of that double
barreled conversation, which is destined to go thun
dering down the ages, but it is safe to suppose that
particular machine will get no more of the colonel's
coin.
It is strange that so much goodness and purity as
shown by the immediate adherents of Burns has not
led them to form a Sunday-school rather than a poli
tical combination for the dissemination of gold bricks.
When the people of this country are told that
Schley was guilty of cowardice they do not say, ''Tell
that to the marines," for they are sure the marines
would never believe it.
Now that the grip is coming West make up your
mind at once not to take it. The year has opened
up in an interesting way, and you had better live to
sec it out.
Jilson and Wright both pleaded guilty and have
thrown themselves upon the mercy of the court, but
they do not manifest a proper penitence.
Burns swears that he has not tried to influence
anybody to vote for him, but still he has not been ob
served chasing any members away.
The witnesses for Burns displayed as well trained
memories as ever soothed and sustained during the
ordeal of examination on the stand.
It is good to hear the talk of retrenchment on the
part of the Supervisors, but don't bet on it. The
broom is new yet.
Assemblyman Works should have left the regula
tion of the cartoon business to some professional
beauty like Mellick.
The people vote for their Congressmen, and scan
dals in connection with Congressional elections are
rare.
Perhaps the country will some time witness the
novel spectacle of Depew delivering a before-dinner
speech
WHAT HflS DAN BURNS DONE?
OUT of two hundred and fifty thousand votes
ten thousand cast dishonestly or under im
proper influences will oftenâ indeed, usually â
determine the result of a State election. Then, while
the mass of the people are sound, the State is cor
luptly governed. Out of a hundred and twenty mem
bers of a Legislature, if twenty are held together by
bribery, in any of its multitudinous forms, they can
frequently determine legislative measures or Sena
torial elections, in respect to which a hundred mem
bers are honestly divided. Then that Legislature
goes down to history with a pestilential reputation.
In the one case two hundred and forty thousand citi
zens, with their families and their material, intellectual
and moral interests, have to suffer. In the other case
a hundred legislators, through their own fatuity, wear
crowns of infamy they do not deserve.
These are compressed illustrations of principal
causes of discontent throughout the Union and es
pecially in this State at the present juncture. We pre
sent them to the members of the Legislature now
struggling to elect a Federal Senator. Can they not
recognize their truth and their bearing upon the im
portant question that is blocking legislation against
the will and to the extreme detriment of the citizens
of California? These gentlemen at Sacramento have
at least average intelligence and education, and they
are American citizens and represent American con
stituencies. Do they not absolutely know, without
precise legal proof, that the influences working for
the success of two of the candidates must be sinister
and corrupt? Can they not read the faces and appre
ciate the characters of the men who arc most conspic
uous in their advocacy of these particular aspirants?
Do they not realize the astuteness, the secrecy, the dia
bolical ingenuity, that must be behind any effort to
elect a Senator through low political combinations
and without regard to qualifications?
Purblindness alone could account for answers to
these questions that would prove unsatisfactory to
the decent citizens of this respectable State. Let our
legislators apply ONE test that is demonstrative and
conclusive. Who is Dan Burns and what has he
ever done that he should be singled out as a proper
man to be a Senator of the United States? Is he a
scholar? No. Has he ever made a speech that in
dicated his knowledge of the history of his country
or capacity to handle any of the great subjects that
are considered in the upper chamber of Congress?
No. Has he ever participated in a debate or shown
his ability to encounter the great minds of the na
tion? No. Has he ever written a paper or done any-^
thing in literature, in statesmanship, in finance, in
commerce, in manufacture, anything of any sort, from
which a million and a half of people or a hundred and
twenty State Senators and Assemblymen can infer
his possession of brains, knowledge, experience,
power, energy, any single quality, that would enable
him for five minutes to stand fnr the State of Cali
fornia and for seventy-five millions of Americans in
the Senate of the United States?
What qualification's, then, does he possess for the
highest office within our gift? None; literally none.
And the only pretension he can make is his participa
tion in fotten municipal politics, in which he has
usually failed. But he, the insoluble mystery of the
hour, has himself put forward one claim, and only
one, to be the successor of Stephen M. White. And
what is that? He says that he became a candidate
and should be elected because he was attacked by The
Call and the Chronicle. This is the sole avowed
ground of his candidacy, determined upon by him
January 2, 1899, and it is the complete measure of
the man. What a farce, if it were not the revelation
of a tragedy, that in a continental republic as the
twentieth century dawns a citizen should be elevated
to the Senate of the United States for no other rea
son than that he was assailed in The Call and in the
Chronicle! But Mose Gunst, the immaculate Police
Commissioner, offers a more solid and more plaus
ible argument. He asserts that Dan Burns should
be elected because he contributed fifteen thousand
dollars toward Republican success in 1898. There
fore, the possession of fifteen thousand dollars, taken
from the bowels of Mexico, no matter how, and its
expenditure in a party campaign, is another con
vincing proof of statesmanship!
And these arc the evidences that the State of Cali
fornia is permitted to furnish of its high standing
before the Union and the world and of its fecundity
in the production of American statesmen! Mose
Gunst for Police Commissioner and Dan Burns for
Federal Senator! These are the standards and these
the types by which American manhood and American
power and influence are to be measured throughout
a continent! We again commend them to the scruti
nizing examination of the voters at Sacramento and
of the voters of the State, and again we repeat that
the State of California, on its own behalf and on be
half of the republic, repudiates the corporate insult
that has marred the opening weeks of the legislative
session and demands the prompt election of a Repub
lican who is both an American statesman and an
American gentleman.
The Legislature can quickly determine, by its vote,
whether, after the evolution of nearly forty-eight
years, Dan Burns is California's best and most avail
able representative citizen.
FOR SOUND FINANCE.
TO the advocates of sound finance there is some
thing of encouragement and good cheer in the
report that the House Committee on Coinage,
Weights and Measures has decided to report a bill
fixing the standard of value upon a gold basis by ex
press declaration of law as it has long been by fact.
According to a summary of the bill given in re
ports from Washington it appears that the measure
provides in substance that the standard of value in
the United States shall be the gold dollar; that all
contracts now existing or to be made in future shall
be computed on that standard; that there shall be es
tablished in the treasury a department of issue and
redemption; that greenbacks now in circulation
shall be retired and gold bills substituted therefor.
For the purpose of carrying out those provisions
the bill declares no silver dollars are to be hereafter
coined except from bullion now in the treasury, the
Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, to coin
silver into subsidiary coin as public urgency demands,
such coinage of bullion to be concurrent with the re
tirement of treasury notes the same as if coined into
silver dollars, and the coinage of such subsidiary coin
td be limited to $50,000,000. There is to be a separa
tion of treasury accounts between issue and financial
transactions; a gold reserve of 25 per cent of out
standing notes and treasury notes is to be maintained;
also 5 per cent gold reserve of the aggregate silver
dollars; a common fund for the redemption of all
notes.
In arranging for the withdrawal of greenbacks from
our currency it is provided that the amount retired'
each year shall- equal the increase of national bank
notes issued subsequent to the taking effect of the
act; 20 per cent to be retired annually during the
next five years, and greenbacks to cease to be legal
tender at the end of ten years. Gold and currency
certificates to be canceled as paid, and not reissued;
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1899.
no national bank notes under $10, and no silver cer
tificates over $5, are to be issued. The tax on national
banks is to be changed from the circulation to one
tenth of I per cent on the capital, surplus and undi
vided profits.
While the details of the measure adopted by the
committee may not be in every respect satisfactory to
all the advocates of currency reform, the fact that
Congress is now directing its attention to the sub
ject will be gratifying. There has been strong oppo
sition to any kind of currency legislation either .by
this Congress or at an extra session of the incoming
one, and for a time it seemed probable that this an
tagonism might seriously block the way of progress.
It will be remembered that a short time ago Con
gressman Walker of the Banking Committee declared
that in his opinion there was no chance of currency
reform either by the present Congress or the next.
That despondent statement, coming from a strong
supporter of sound finance, so far from discouraging
the advocates of reform, served to arouse them to a
consciousness of the danger ahead. Since that time
their efforts have been more vigorous than ever, and
there is now a probability something will be ac
complished. '
The settlement of the issue ought not to be post
poned under any consideration. Currency reform can
be best carried out while the country and the people
are prosperous. If the friends of the measure wait
until over-speculation or over-production causes
another panic or temporary suspension of industry,
they will then have to perform amid excitement and
distress what can now be achieved without disturbing
business in any way whatever.
NO matter what may be the fate of the expan
sion policy, there is coming â indeed, there is
upon vs â a great access of commercial interest
in the Pacific. This requires a corresponding increase
in the costly activities of the Government on this side
of the continent, and especially an increase in naval
operations and all that pertains thereto, and in Gov
ernment transportation. In this situation some things
are needed to make sure of San Francisco's position.
Since the building of the Mint here this city has had
the benefit of practically centering the gold bullion
trade here. That business has been carried on eco
nomically for the Government and profitably for the
miner. The sub-treasury has been the means of dis
tributing the coin widely throughout the West, and
the fact of the sub-treasury and Mint both being here
is responsible for the presence in the banks and in
circulation of gold coin in actual, hourly use through
out this region, and making it accessible to all the
people. By this means our wage-earners have had the
handling of their wages in gold coin, and that it has
directly and favorably affected their habits oi thrift
and economy is in daily evidence.
When the Klondike and other Alaskan gold
became an important factor in the bullion movement
Congress was induced to establish an assay office at
Seattle, and the effect thereof is being felt unfavorably
in San Francisco. The original purpose of an assay
office was to pig the bullion and certify its fineness,
receiving a fee therefor. That is to say, for a fee the
Government prepared the miners' bullion for the mar
ket and certified its fineness. At the Seattle assay
office, however, the practice has arisen of .not only
preparing the bullion, but buying it on Government
account, shipping it to the Philadelphia mint and
paying for it by exchange on Chicago. The miner is
not profited* for he must discount his exchange, but
the banks profit largely by it.
It is obvious that the proper system, and we think
that required by law, would be to pay for the bullion
by warrants on the nearest sub-treasury and ship it
to the nearest mint, which would bring both warrant
and bullion in San Franci?co. It will be seen that,
pursuing the opposite course, the Government is
competing with itself, to the sole advantage of bank
ers in Seattle and Chicago. The bullion is sent to the
Philadelphia mint, which is so crowded by the coin
age of small change to supply the Eastern demand
that it has no time nor facilities for coining the gold,
which is now piled up there in volume to the amount
of nearly $150,000,000. All of this business is a dis
tinct blow at San Francisco, and it requires attention
lest it be followed by another, in the estab
lishment of a mint on Puget Sound.
There has also recently been sent from Seattle to
Washington a demand for the exclusive placing there
of the ocean transportation service of the Govern
ment. The reasons given are that ship and car come
together, which is forbidden in San Francisco, and
that therefore the business can be handled quicker
and cheaper there than here.
Behind this last showing lurks another proposition
to establish the great navy yard of the coast on Puget
Sound, facing Esquimalt, the Pacific Gibraltar of
Great Britain, the reasons being the lack of water
supply, co?t of coal and other real or fancied disabili
ties at Mare Island. Now, there is no doubt but what
the great navy-yard of the nation is to be on this
coast. There should also be no doubt that it is to
be Mare Island. In the first place, such an estab
lishment, being so intimately connected with our de
fensive power, should be as nearly as possible inac
cessible to an enemy. The equipment of a great
navy-yard is costly, as its facilities are important to
national defense. To expose it to assault and capture
is not only to risk the destruction of millions of prop
erty, but to expose a vital spot in the national body
to a paralyzing blow.
Mare Island is so situated that every dollar spent
on our harbor defense makes it safer from assault. In
preparing those defenses the Government is not only
protecting the property of our citizens from attack by
an enemy, but guarding its own property and another
prime means of defense.
The Mint, sub-treasury and navy-yard were estab
lished here by the far-sighted men like Senator Gvvin
and his colleagues, to whom was first committed the
public care of California. This State cost the Federal
Government nothing for territorial novitiate. It was
at once admitted into the Union, and at once began
contributing to the support of the National Govern
ment. It has paid in Federal taxes nearly $400,000,
--000 since it was admitted, and has received back a
very small percentage of that sum in Federal salaries
and public works.
Our people need something more practical than
ecstatic dreams of a great future predicated upon a
great past. They must understand that there are com
petitors in the field, and that our position cannot be
held by indulging in reveries, however pleasant.
With an amendment providing that every legislator
be equipped with a barb wire trocha for the baffling
of reporters, Boycc's measure would indeed be a
thing of beauty.
Perhaps the Eastern capitalists who affirm that
there arc no openings for investment have never tried
to get into the Senate.
If Eagan receives no penalty more severe than a
mere bounce from the army he ought to consider him
self lucky.
Spitting in the eye of a man is an act which would
naturally suggest a sequel.
SOME THINGS NEEDED.
WILL COLONEL
MAZUMA OF
ILLINOIS COME
Two Bills That May
Interest Him.
TO BAR RECTIFIED SPIRITS
A PURE-FOOD MEASURE THAT
PROMISES TROUBLE.
A "Single-Stamp" Law That Would
Deprive the Spirit Trust of an
Enormous Business â Whole
salers Won't Fight It
There is something doing in Sacramento
these days besides balloting for United
States Senator and expediting the trial of
Speaker Wright and other members with
lax ideas of the propriety of accepting or
considering bribes. It is a measure known
as the single-stamp bill, and applies
wholly to the sale of whiskies in Cali
fornia.
To the layman who goes up and down
the line and around the block, taking his
toddy in good faith, asking no questions,
it really means nothing. To the whole
sale whisky dealers, of whom about 95
per cent are rectifiers of spirits, it rep
resents divers and sundry things of an un
pleasant nature. This proposition will be
better understood when it is realized that
the business of these houses is rectifying
of spirits, and that this bill prohibits the
sale of such goods within the boundaries
of the State. The effect of the adoption
and enforcement of such a measure, pro
viding that only double-stamp whiskies,
or those pure from the States of Ken
tucky, Pennsylvania and other whisky
producing States, can be sold, would be
to revolutionize the business in this State
and largely reduce the number of whole
salers, as only the stronger houses would
be able to profitably handle the straight,
or double-stamp, goods at a satisfactory
profit.
As an illustration of what kind of an
insurgent the introducer of this bill is,
it is only necessary to state that the av
erago annual receipts of spirits in San
Francisco are 21,000 barrels, of fifty gal
lons to the barrel. These goods are 190
proof, and, when incorporated with whis-
Kies, represent about two gallons to one
of spirits. As the imports of spirits
amount to a million gallons a year, the
immensity of the trade can be realized.
On the other hand, the importation of
straight whiskies for the year 18yy aggre
gated over 18,000 cases and 24,000 barrels.
However, a large portion of the latter
went into rectiiuation with spirits.
This scheme is a sort of Uanquo's ghost
to the rectifiers, who denounce it as a
plain cinch bill, and who have become ap
auietic and not disposed to put up sub
stantial reasons why the bill should not
become a law. However, this may be
the occasion on which the unexpected
will happen. This single-stamp bill is
along the lines of pure-food legisla
tion, and will trip gayly along with As
sembly Kill No. 73, to create the "Bureau
of State Inspection of Foods, Drinks and
Drugs in the State of California."
Section 2 of this bill provides that "said
commissioners are charged with the en
forcement throughout the State of CaJ-
Ifornia of all laws against fraud and
adulteration or impurities in foods, drinks
or drugs, and all laws against unlawful
labeling." It shall be the duty of said
commissioners to inspect all articles of
food or drinks or drugs manufactured or
offered for sale or held in possession for
purposes of sale in this State. This com
mission is given power of search, and is
required to prosecute all violations of the
law. In fact, it is given the broadest
scope for action and is to co-operate with
the State Board of Health in its labors
In view of the fact that the Manufact
urers and Producers' Association, the
Merchants' Association and other bodies
are strenuously urging the passage of a
stringent measure of this nature it is
probable that, in the event that the Leg
islature finishes politics in time to get
down to lawmaking, this long-j=ought-for
pure-food legislation will be successfully
accomplished.
On account of the pure food movement
the situation is an awkward one for the
whisky men, for the reason that it would
be necessary to defeat both measures in
order to prevent interference with their
business. It appears, however, that the
most influential local houses are not in
clined to enter the light against the pro
posed legislation. In speaking of the mat
ter yesterday. Joseph I,oewe of the Wil
merdiog-Loewe Company said:
"No, I do not intend to have anything to
dowuh the proposition. It is the same
old story; there are about three big
nouses in San Francisco that are ex
pected to make all the rights for the rest
of the trade and let them enjoy all the
benefits without any trouble or expense.
This single stamp bill is a cinch game,
anyhow, and I propose to let matters take
their course. I am sure of the fact that
I can stand the pressure under the pro
posed change if those dealers can who al
ways expect others to take their inter
ests in hand and care for them. That is
just where I stand."
The same sentiment seemed to prevail
in the office of the Crown Distilleries
Company, an institution that is usually
very active in promoting the interests of
the trade. Mr. Haas stated that his firm
regarded the movement with a large de
gree of apathy, and that they would prob
ably remain onlookers and let matters
take their course. "It does not matter so
much to us in any event," said he.
There is an institution, however, that
would have paralysis of the financial
nervp center if such a measure should
become an operative law. and that is
the Spirits Trust, which has its monster
distilleries in Peoria. 111. There are about
$2,000,000 worth of spirits sold in Califor
nia annually, and the greater portion is
sold by this corporation. Inasmuch as
they have been known to influence na
tional legislation in the interest of their
business it is reasonable to suppose that
if they thought they were liable to lose
this valuable market they would take very
active steps to put stumbling blocks in
the way of these bills. If it becomes
necessary for the trust to do this kind
of business they w.il be represented by a
Colonel Mazuma the like of which has
never been seen in Sacramento.
On the other hand, the allied distillers
of Kentucky and Pennsylvania, who man
ufacture double stamp goods, are wildly
desirous that such a measure be adopted,
as it would at once open up an immense
new market for their goods. Tf the bood
lers in the liegislature could get thrse two
groat interests at loggerheads over these
lulls they would certainly come home with
"money to burn."' whichever way the
fi~ht went. As a cash producer it would
beat the business of making Senator in
a walk.
The movement is of particular mo
ment to the small retail dealers, who
handle only rectified goods, and would
also prevent the sale in tnis State of the
most famous brands bottled in this city.
This is due to the fact that blended whis
kies of different ages, although not mixed
with spirits, could not be sold. Whether
or not the powers behin- the pure food
bills are strong enough to secure the
legislation they seek, to the violent dis
organization of the business of the whole
sale whisky dealers, remains to be seen.

Bondsmen of the Old
* Board.
Not only over the heads of fifty or sixty
teachers will the official ax swing, but
the cruel instrument will be used on other
victims as well. Fourteen janitorsâ ten
male and four femaleâ will be "consoli
dated" out of their positions. These will
not come from any certain schools, but
will be gleaned from all.
In their original way of making places
1 for friends the late Board of Education
i did not stop at material for teachers'
, jobs, but made places freely. Laborers
â¢ and janitors were added to the salary
i rolls at pleasure.
These facts have come to the notice of
. the present board, and fourteen ianltors
> will therefore be stricken from the pay
; rolls.
; On Monday evening tne Elementary
i Committee considered the reports and rec
i ommendations of the principals. The list
1 of teachers employed in December was
. compared with the prepared list, less the
number whose classes were consolidated
1 out. In many cases the reports of 'he
principals were approved, but in others
â¢ there was an apparent hesitancy to rec
-1 ommend the cuitlng off of able teachers.
, On these the committee "acted," and
many times the blue pencil marked out
that class. Seemingly there is no hesita
tion on the part ot the Board of Educa
tion to carry out the provisions of the cel
ebrated "act of January i."
In the consolidation of the evening i
school classes the list Is complete for the
work of to-night, and the spirit of reform
will move rapidly.
A member of the Finance Committee,
who has put in his time studying out the
money problem, makes the following
statments:
'â¢The funds of the School Department
are in very much of an unsettled state
and will remain so until Judge Seawell
has answered the question as to whether
the one-twelfth act applies to the Board
of Education, as it admittedly does to the
expenditures of the Board of Supervisors.
If the court holds that it does apply the
Board of Education will have control of
six-twelfths of the total appropriation of
the fiscal year of 1898-1899. Then if the
board's action regarding the reclassiflca
tion Is carried out and something like or c
hundred teachers are cut off from the sal
ary rolls there will be money enough to
pay the remaining teachers for six
months, ending June 6.
"After these payments a small balance
will be left for the absolutely needed sup
plies and repairs of the department, but
there will be no money for the new
houses and furniture or for the one hun
dred and one things purchased by the old
board.
"If Judge SeaweJl decides that the one
twelfth act does not apply to the Board
of Education and that body is legally
compelled to pay bills contracted prior
to 1899 there will be a huge deficit in the
school fund, approximating a quarter of '
a million of dollars. Then will come tho |
question of how to run the department I
six months on a sum barely sufficient for
half that period. The board has no pref- I
â¢erence in regard to creditors and is of
the general opinion that the teachers and
merchants should share alike.
"It is very distasteful to the members
of the board to assume the position that
they cannot recognize any claims con
tracted prior to January 1, 1899, and they
only do so because of the belief that the
one-twelfth act applies to all depart
ments of the city government, anÂ«l as
they had nothing to do with the contract
ing of these bills which, if allowed, will
be legally in excess of the act, they can
see no reason for considering the payment
of the same."
The general opinion in legal circles is j
that Judge Seawell will either decide that j
act does not apply to the. finances of the
School Department or that a teacher's j
salary is provided for by statute, and in '
either case those salaries will be paid. I
Public sentiment leans to this view, and I
to legislate teachers out of their money |
largely because of the criminal extrava
gance of the late board would be an in
justice and a hardship. In case of an ad
verse decision their only course will be j
is to bring suit against the bondsmen of '
the old board, as those ex-officers are sup
posed to be liable for the excessive ex
penditures of the old board.
Even this possible good fortune to the
teachers may be long in coming, if it ever
does. The merchants threaten to bring up
the matter of paid vacations and may
hold that question over the heads of the
educators for the purpose of bringing
about some kind of a compromise.
A number of mandamus suits by con
solidated out teachers will immediately
follow the publication of the fatal list this
evening. '

My baby had a terrible breaking out all over

on it for the past ten years. They claim

Involved is comparatively small.
'The other items are the same, being
of comparatively small amounts, with the
exception of the amount set aside for the
new police station. To defer the building
of this will not profit the city in the long
run. It owns the lot already, and the ex
pense of $50,000 for a station will save the
city $9000 a year that it now pays for rent
and stabling facilities. It Is all right to
watch needless expenditures, but Dr. Per
rault is not on the right track in the pres
ent instance. The members of the board
must watch the interests of the people
who elected them. There is a general de
mand for these proposed improvements,
and when the time comes I think the ma
jority of the board members will give
heed to that demand."
CAUGHT WITH HIS BOOTY.
Ed Smith, a Window "Flypaper"
Thief, Locked Up in "the
Tanks."
The window "flypaper" thieves are still
carrying on their operations to the an
noyance and loss of storekeepers
throughout the city. Early yesterday
morning the window In the grocery of
Hermann Hackfeld, corner of Hayes and
Lyon street?, was broken and twelve bot
tles of whisky were stolen.
An hour or two later Policeman Fen
nell saw a man on Stockton street carry
ing a bundle, which aroused the officer' 3
suspicions. He questioned the man and
not getting a satisfactory answer opened
the bundle and discovered six bottles of
whisky. He placed the man under ar
rest and locked him up in "the tanks"
at the City Prison pending further Inves
tigation. The man gave the name of Ed
Smith, but that is not his true name, and
Fennell believes that he is one of the
gang of "flypaper" thieves.
Yesterday morning Hackfeld reported
his loss at police headquarters, and on
being shown the six bottles of whisky
found in Smith's possession he at oneÂ»
Identified them as being his property.
Smith has not yet been booked.

A. H. McKay Wants His Advance
Agents Arrested for Obtaining
Money by False Pretenses.
A. H. McKay, 18 Lewis place, swore to
a complaint in Judge Graham's court yes
terday for the arrest of Henri Stewart
and W. H. Wheeler on a charge of ob
taining money by false pretenses. Stew
art is in the city, but Wheeler is in the
country.
McKay was induced by Stewart and
Wheeler to supply the money to take the
Twentieth Century Vaudeville company
on the road to play the farce comedy,
"My Neighbors Wife." They claimed
that they had to pay a royalty on the
play and got $10 from him for that pur
pose. Therein lies the charge, as Mc-
Kay alleges, that there was no such
thing as royalty. Stewart and Wheeler
started out as advance agents of the
company on December 3, and in a very
short time McKay had dropped about
$1000 in his theatrical venture before the
company got strantk-d. Now he is a
sadder and wiser man.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TV EDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1899.
JUVA NEARLY
WON AT ODDS
OF 100 TO 1
Led Her Field to the
Paddock.
BEATEN OUT BY JENNIE REID
ABUSE EXTENDED TO DEFEAT
SAM McKEEVER.
The Two-Year-Old Lomond Equaled
a Coast Record â Four Choices
Finished in Front â Dr.
Bernays Scored.
A stocky looking chestnut filly named
Juva, hailing from the Montana country
and ridden by a little "bush" jockey,
Mounce, nearly captured a race at Oak
land yesterday .with odds of 100 to 1 posted
against her. This despised one was a
starter in the last event of the day, a
sprint at the Futurity distance, an affair
replete with warm things. Schreiber's
Good Hope finally closed favorite, with
both Jennie Reid and Senora Caesar car-
rying heavy commissions, the latter es
pecially being highly touted. When the
barrier was released Mounce and Juva
were soon out in front. The filly had a
good lead into the stretch and it was only
in the final stages of the running that
Spencer managed to get up with Jennie
Reid and beat the outsider something
over a length. A more experienced rider
could probably have won. Good Hope, the
favorite, was third.
The only other favorite to prove a dis
appointment was Captive, beaten out by
Dr. Bernays. Formella, Mistleton,
Lomond and Abuse all won at fairly good
betting quotations.
By long odds the best performance of
the day was that of Fred Foster's crack
sprinter, Abuse. The horse with the cork
screw legs picked up 117 pounds in the
fifth event at si?Â»rfurlongs and bÂ«at Sam
McKeever out in a drive, covering the dis
tance in 1:13 flat. The winner closed a
2 to 5 favorite.
Formella defeated a cheap band of plat
er." in the opening seven-furlong run. The
Brutus filly had Spencer in the saddle and
won with comparative ease from Master
Buck. Johnny Woods managed to finish
third with Be Happy.
This win was followed up with another
victory for the Elmwood Farm. Mistle
ton, piloted by Thorpe, and a stanch first
choice, was always in the front rank in
the mile and a sixteenth event that fol
lowed, and at the wire downed Master
Lee a couple of lengths. I'lm, through
weak riding, was a bang-up third, beaten
for the place but a neck.
Lomond, a good looking bay colt by
Imp. Midlothian-Talluda, equaled the
coast record for three and one-half fur
lop.ks in the kindergarten scramble. The
youngster had Thrope at the helm, and
beating his (V j ld away, won out. hard
ridden, from Reginald Hughes. With bet
ter luck the latter might have reversed
things. Harry Thatcher, a son of Imp.
Pirate of Penzance, from Caesar Young's
barn, showed plenty of speed, finishing a
flattering third. The winner, coupled with
Nomadic, closed favorite in the betting.
The mile selling run went to Dr. Ber
nays, ridden by Spencer. The latter stole
the insido position from Piggott astride
Captive, in the run home, and driving
hard earned the verdict by a head.
Track Notes.
Frank Eckert, the widely known book
maker, who has been sojourning in Colo- I
rado for the benefit of his health since i
the Eastern season closed, was an on- I
looker at the track yesterday.
Spencer piloted three and Thorpe two of >
the winning horses. The former's ride
astride Dr. Bernays was a pretty piece of
saddle work.

MAKE A TEST OF STUART'S DYS-
PEPSIA TABLETS.
No trouble is more common or more misun-
derstood than nervous dyspepsia. 'People hav-
ing It think their nerves are to blame and are
surprised that they are not cured by nerve
medicines. The real seat of the mischief is
lost sight of. The stomach is the organ to be
looked after.
Nervous dyspeptics often do not have any
pain whatever la the stomach, nor perhaps i
any of the usual symptoms of stomach weak- !
ness. Nervous dyspepsia shows Itself not In
the stomach so much as in nearly every or-
gan. In some cases the heart palpitates and is
irregular; in others the kidneys are affected;
in others the bowels are constipated, with
headaches; still others are troubled with loss

It is safe to say that Stuart's Dyspepsia Tab-
lets will cure any stomach weakness or dis-
ease except cancer of the stomach. They cure
sour stomach, gas, : loss of flesh and appetite,
sleeplessness, palpitation, heartburn, constipa-
tion and headache.

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial says of Raisins
and Dried Fruits: "There was a stronger feel-
Ing noted i.t yesterday's opening, and indica
tions pointed toward a week of increased ac
tivity. There has been a gradual enlargement
of business, and prices have moved upward
by fractions on many lines. Reports of ex
bausttoo Â;' supplies and the Impossibility of
buying some lines from first hands tend to
hold the market firm, and prevent any return
to former low prices and dull business.
"Prunes are unchanged, but apparently trust
worthy reports say that t>oo cars will cover all '
coast holdings, and those are principally Santa
CJara goods. If this be true, and buyers are
apparently inclined to accept it as a fact, the
market is in strong position. The small lot
Y>u> ing which has been practically the only
trade recently, indicates that distributors are
not heavily stocked, and it is believed that In
creased demand must cause an Increase in
pn<es. Spot prices are unchanged, but all
BUi>plies are held firmly up to quotations, and
no disposition to shade is shown by dealers.
"Raisins are in the same position noted pre
viously. There is Httle call for any grade of
Joose Muscatels, except on small orders, and all
business is of a retail character. Buyers are*
indifferent, and there are no Indications of a
change in sentiment at present."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.â Enormous realizing j
ar.i short sales to-day materially affected the |
quoted prices of stocks. The dealings were In j
excess of a million and a third of shares, and |
at no time did prices of the higher valued rail
road stocks reach yesterday's closing figures.
Heavy sales In the early dealings were caused
partly by the lower range of London quota
tions, and there were numerous declines ex
ceeding a point. A sharp upward movement !
followed, support being extended to Michigan
Central, Union Pacific preferred. General Elec
tric, People's Gas, Manhattan and Missouri
Pacific; New Jersey Central, Tennessee Coal
and Iron and Federal â  Steel common were also
lifted. The trading element began to sell free
ly as the effect of heavy profit taking was ap
preciated. The market at first became dull as
prices receded, but the selling gradually as
eumed larger volume, and quotations rapidly
crumbled away, eventually weakening prac
tically all stock traded in. In the absence of
unfavorable news the reaction was attributed
to technical conditions. By reaching stop-loss
orders In the more active shares material
slumps occurred in prices, with as much as a
point or more difference In quotations between
transactions. Money continued easy, and the
banks were expected to make another gain In
cash this week. The movement of money from
the interior and from California continues
heavily In favor of New York. The' lowest
price of the day was made In the final hour,
and selling at that time wiped out; the gains
In stocks made earlier in the day.
The extreme breaks In the Vanderbllts ranged'
â¢up to 4>i in Northwest. In the Flower special
ties the largest break was in New York Air
Brake. C points. ' The drop â¢in the Grangers
ranged from 2 points Jn Hock Island and to
3 l i In Burlington. Among the coalers the
â lump ranged up to 4 1 ,4 in Reading first pre
ferrred. . In the Pacific the extreme drop was
4 points In Union Pacific preferred. Pennsyl
vania, dipped 3%, American Malt 3, and Gen
eral Electric 3. â¢
New. York, Ontario and Western was the
most active stock on the list, and dropped 2%
points.
A number of wagers were settled to-day when
Missouri Pacific, . on dividend rumors, crossed
Northern Pacific common In the forenoon trad-
Ing. A feature of the market was the resump
tion of activity in the middle class and low
priced stocks.
The bond market displayed early strength,

LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.-The Commercial Ad- j
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: !
The markets were brisk hero to-day. In
Americans it was a day of specialties* There
were free realizations here and the market was
disappointed by the New York Central's denial
of . the Vanderbllt consolidation report, but
New York came strong for the coalers, es
pecially Ontario and Western, 10,000 being taken 1
In one line, and the group rallied - sharply. I
Baltimore and Ohio spurted In the street.
London, however, was less confident to-day.
Spanish fours were COYs on Paris buying. Cop
pers were buoyant. Tlntos touched 35' i and
closed at 65%. Anacondas were hard.
I Money was at the slackest. There was more
j competition for bills. In some quarters It is
> thought the bank rate will be reduced, to 3
per cent on Thursday. The big banks hold off.
Tin gained Â£4 a ton. A syndicate controls
the west market. Thirteen thousand pounds ;

CALIFORNIA ORANGES IN THE EAST.
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.â The Journal of Com
morce says: The policy of holding trl-wcekly
instead of dally sales of California oranges
was Inaugurated yesterday and will be given
a week's trial. A majority of trade receivers,
as well as Jobbers, are heartily In favor of
the plan. Buyers showed their appreciation
of this concession on the part of the receivers
by spirited bidding, running the price up In
one or two Instances to JG for extra fancy
stock. The average advance was s@loc per
box on fancy and 15Â® 20c on choice grades In
all nineteen cars, or 6384 boxes, were sold at
a range of $2 80iij5. Color and quality of the
fruit were an Improvement on that previously
offered, aud for quality sold results were held
by sellers to be the most satisfactory for the
season so far. A number of receivers and job
bers after the sale expressed themselves well
satisfied with the result of the first day's sales
under the new departure and were of the opin
ion that the plan of trl-weekly sales would 'be
made a permament Institution.
Shipments of California oranges to all parts
of the country are being made at the rate of
thirty-five to forty cars of 336 boxes each
which quantity in view of the decreasing sup
plies or Jamaicas and Florldas and limited
stocks of Sicily ana Valencia fruit is held to
be scarcely more than enough to cover Imme
diate needs of consumption In the various
markets. Hence the feeling is firm and the
tendency of the market la upward.
CHICAGO MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 24.â Nervousness on the part
of shorts and higher cables from Liverpool
started Wheat strong. May opened
higher at 12^<a'2\c, but the realUatton cf
prottts at the Improvement became so general
that the price touched 72Â»4c in a few mlnutos.

Wool rules dull. A local circular saye: '"The
Wool market Is unchanged since our last re
port. Scoured are idle , and there seems 'to be
no demand for scoured locally or In the East

i Since the Alameda left there has 1 been but
â¢ one arrival of coal from Australiaâ Birkdale,
with 2394 tons. '.This Is peculiarly exceptional
to 1 have but one-arrival. from Newcastle, N. S.
W.,-in.one month; -this 'makes a delivery here
of only 21,074 tons In three months, which is a
, very j low average -as compared with the past.
i The very high prevailing â ' rates of freight, on
coal during 1898 have deterred speculators from
Investing, and forced some of our larg- -
est consumers to utilize . other grades. ' This
will be ; overcome this . year, as I prices are . al
ready commencing to shape themselves . for
deliveries later- on, at figures which will en
tice steam fuel consumers pto return to Aus
tralian..- A generous .rainfall in February and
March -will force shipowners to divert, their
property In this direction, carrying coal' prin
cipally at 50 cents-, to Â° 75 cents per ton less than
the ruling rates of last season. Early -load-
Ing ships are still receiving fair , freights, as
: tonnage is not . plentiful at' present ' in Aus
; tralian â  waters, and there is a brisk demand
there for Valparaiso and the ' South Coast.
There are y at present engaged to carry coal
here from Sydney and : Newcastle thirty ves
sels with a carrying | capacity of about 82,000
tons;, ten of ..these have .already sailed, some
of them will not load for six months yet. Ten
.of : these are vessels owned r in * San Francisco,
returning here after having discharged car
goes of lumber at different Australian ports.
The coast collieries are in arrears in their
local deliveries of coal. The demand for. same
has been so brisk, and . the consumption :at
this season of the year Is always materially
increased.' ' ....

ON FIRE AT
THE GAS WORKS
Cavaliere Ciampa's
Narrow Escape.
FIVE TUGS WORKED ON HER
OAKUM, SAILS AND OIL IN THE
LAZARETTE ABLAZE.
[Transports Beady to Sail â Schooners
in Hard Luck â Strike on the
â Morgan City â For the
Klondike Again.
A firÂ© broke out in the lazarette of the
Italian ship Cavaliere Clampa early yes
tftrday afternoon and it was with diffi
culty that the tugs Reliance and Alert
succeeded in putting it out. In fact, at
one time the danger looked so great that
the ship's lines were cast off and the tugs
started to tow her to the mud flats to fill
her full of water. As it was, the cabin
floor had to be torn up and a bulkhead
knocked away in order to reach the seat
of the fire.
The Cavaliere Ciampa arrived here from
Swansea on January 17 with 2543 tons of
coal. Monday last she went to the gas
works to discharge and yesterday the
â work of unloading her began. About 2
p. m. a fire was discovered in the after
lazarette. The place was full of sails,
rope, oakum, oil and other inflammable
material, and in a few minutes the cabin
â was full of smoke. Flames quickly fol
lowed, and Captain Maresca lost no time
in giving an alarm. A telephone message
brought the tugs Reliance and Alert to
the scene, but it was found almost im
possible to reach the tire. The smoke
was so dense in the cabin that it was
dangerous to enter, so an attempt was
made- to a hose to play on the fire by
cutting away the after bulkhead, in this
way the Reliance and Alert got live
streams into the lasarette, but still the
fire burned on.
A still alarm was then sent to the Po
trero fire station and one engine re
sponded. It was at this time that the or
ders went forth to cast off the vessel*
mooring lines and take her to the mud
flats. Just a 6 she was about to be moved
away the order was countermanded and
the firemen got into the cabin and tore
up the flooring covering the lazarett.i.
Tne Alert got her hose into this opening
and the fire was soon under control.
While, the Reliance and Alert were hard
at work pumping thousands of gallons of
water into the burning ship the tug Mon
arch came along and she also made fast
and turned a stream of water on the fire.
Later the tugs Sea King and Sea Queen
came along, but by that time the lire
was under control and the danger was
past. The Reliance and Alert remained
by the ship all night, and it will take
them nearly all of to-day to pump the
water out of the vessel again.
It was lucky the fire was confined to
the lazarette, as had it spread to the
coal nothing but scuttling would have
saved the Cavallere Ciampa.
Another fleet of transports is being
made ready to start for Manila. The
Morgan City has been ready for some
time and is now lying at Harrison street
wharf awaiting the passengers who will
FÂ£U! on her. The Scandia at Pacific street
wharf has nearly all oej cargo aboard
ami the soldiers who are to go by her aro
expected to-day. Jt is expected that these
two vessels will sail to-morrow or Friday
at the latest.
â¢ Ohio has been docked at Folsom
street and the Senator will go alongside
wharf as soon as the Mart
to-nlght. Both these vessels
wiil carry a large quantity of supplies
and nearly a. regiment each. They can
ly for sea in a week and will
bly rollow the Scandla and Morgan
City about February l. The Scandia
Bhould reach Manila early in March, and
as the regiment of regulars she carries
is to relieve the California boys the
chances are that the latter will "return
on that troop ship. That would land the
native sons in California early in May
General Shafter paid a Visit to all the
transports yesterday. He Inspected every
hole and corner of ,-ach vessel and made
a personal Inspection of the soldiers' ra
tions and the soldiers' quarters. There
â will be no cause to grumble on these
tmop ships if he i ;in help it.
The crack steamer Humboldt came out
of retirement yesterday and is again go
ing Into the Klondike trade. At the close
of last season she was thoroughly over
riaiilea and made as good as new, after
which she was laid up at Antloch for the
winter. She was brought Sown yesterday
ana docked at her old berth at Washing"
ton-street wharf. She will leave for Se
attle next Sunday, and wfll hereafter run
between Seattle and Skaguay direct. All
the other steamers on the route stop at
Juneau and Dyea, but the
"Alaska flyer" will only have the two
ports of call, and Captain Bonnifleld ex
pects to make the run in sixty-two hours
The schooners Volant and Seven Sisters
a.re having hard luck. The Volant left
here on October 8 and the Seven Sisters
on October 22 for Nehalem River. ThÂ«y
got in over the bar and secured a load
of lumber all right, but while loading was
poing on the river had fallen so low that
they could not get out again. The Asto
rian says:
It is thought the schooners can be taken i
ever the bar without removing any of their I
cargoes, as the winter freshets have cut a new !
channel leading to the ocean of sufficient depth !
to allow them to pass through. The new chan- j
nel runs -close to the sooth Hide of the harbor i
end the old one. on the north side, Is now en- I
1 1 rely clnged up. There is eighteen feet of
timer in u he new channel at high tide, and with '
this depth it is thought little difficulty will be I
round in takinr the schooners to sea When
the Fchooners last attempted to cross out they
stuck on the bar, and the Volume is leaking
at the rate of two inches an ho#p. Her rudder
and a piece of the keel were carried away
by the accident. Her repairs will cost $5000.

POSTUM CEREAL.
A TEACHER'S DUTY
Extends to Food and Drink.
I noticed 'wo of my little pupils,
brother and Â«ister, when reaching up
for a hook or any article that l desired
to hand to them, trembled more or \em
from the fingers to thr shoulder.
I finally concluded this was not shy
but was really some physical
trouble, and upon inquiring I discov
ered that they were In the habit of
drinking coffee every morning for
breakfast. 1 warned the children to
off the (offer, for 1 knew it was
th-'- cause of their trouble, and would
ruin them if continued in. I always
urge children to use Postum Food Cof
fee, for I know that to be healthful,
strengthening and a perfectly natural
liquid food. A short time thereafter
the little folk? spoken of were entirely
well of their slight palsy.
It is a distressing state of affairs
wbtre parents permit children to U6e
ordinary coffee.
Many cases have come to my notice
where the taste of Postum was not
llkr-d, but in all such cases the dislike
arises from the failure to properly boil
it. It is a very tasteless liquid when
underboiled, and a very delicious,
strong, rich, satisfying coffee when
boiled long enough to bring out the
flavor and food value. Dr. Helen Coe,

pumps were tested and it was seen that
the vessel was making no water the cap

There is trouble with th^ crew of the
transport Morgan City over a cut in
wages. Formerly the sailors were paid
$30 and the (juartermasters $35 a month.
X..W the rate is $25 Â»n<\ $80 b ir>..ntÂ»i re
spectively. Nor is this all. Formerly
there were employed eight sailors mÂ»J
four quartermasters and a mess boy each
for the sailors and firemen. Now the
crew consists of six sailors at $25. three
o.uart^rmast^rs at $30 and one mess boy
for both sailors and firemen at $15 a
month.
The trouble began last payday. Since
the vessel has been in port the men have
been paid off twice. On Ihe first occa
sion the crew pot the usual wage, but on
the second occasion they were tendered
the lower amount. The men refused to
accept thr lower figure and walked out.
Captain Dillon then went to Lam's sail
or boarding house and secured a crew at
the lower rate. Now tfu-se men are
THEIR CRAWS WERE
FILLED WITH GOLD
Remarkable Enterprise of Some Intelligent
Fowls.
ON Saturday last The Call published the exclusive account of the find
ing of a rich ledge of gold In this city in the neighborhood of Noe, Cas
tro and Hartford streets, in the particular district bounded by Nine
teenth and Twentieth streets.
Jonathan Anderson, a builder, claims to have discovered this vein of
gold two years ago, while engaged In digging a sewer on Hartford street.
It has been generally known in the neighborhood thnt there was a vrin of
gold In that vicinity. Rumor has It that paying tock has been taken from
individual lots in small quantity. This lodge of quartz runs beneath a num
ber of dwellings, which precludes the idea of mining thf gold unless the
houses be first torn down, and the uncertainty of the quality and quantity of
the rock has so far prevented this from being done.
It remained for John Q. A. Patterson, who lives at the southeast corner of
Hartford and Nineteenth streets, to discover a means hy which this precious
ore may be mined. A chicken, a thin white chicken, was the medium
through which Patterson made his discovery. In all the history of California
a ohiekan has never before posed as a miner. Now that these feathered
animals have entered a now field, where they may be even more useful than
in the soup, It is safe to say that their value will be enhanced and that in
the future they will be exclusively raised for another purpose than that of
being eaten. Patterson was recently digging a foundation for a small house
which he erected on the corner he has purchased. He had in the yard a
numÃer of fowls, that scratched and dug to their hearts' content in the
ciirth thrown up. It was mostly gravel. Now, if there is anything that a
chicken of educated tastes likes it Is gravel. Well. Patterson's chickens ate
pravel all the day. They made no distinctions; they ate any kind of gravel
that was thrown up from the foundation trenches.
Only a short while ago Patterson killed some of these same chickens
that had eaten the gravel, and to his amazement he found in their craws
a quantity of small gold. One old rooster Is said to have had an ounce of this
gold deposit. This particular chicken was worth at least $20. Of course
this will naturally have the effect of raising the price on chickens that come
from that portion of the city. Hereafter they will be sold by the gram and
ounce. Some of the market men are already trying to corner the market on
all the fowls that have been raised In the neighborhood of the gold vein and
one particularly enterprising poultry vender says he will hereafter guarantee
to his customers a gold-filled craw with every chicken that they may pur
chase.
All the residents of the neighborhood have begun to feed their fowls on
gravel. One man. who has a vacunt lot, expects to plow it up and then turn

STUDENTS ON
A HUNT FOR A
NIGHT SCHOOL
Seeking Learning Un
der Difficulties.
DIRECTOR HEAD'S WORK
THE NEIGHBORING SCHOOLS
ALL CROWDED.
Pupils Circulate a Petition to Be
Presented to the Board of
Education This Even
ing.
The unusual spectacle of a band of
students hunting for a school was wit
nessed in the Mission last Monday even-
Ing. It was occasioned by the sudden
closing of the Mission Evening School last
Friday, by order of Director Head of the
Board of Education. The eighty pupils
assembled at the schoolhouse Monday
night and awaited the opening of the
doors. Becoming weary of the long de
lay they went In a body to the residence
of one of their teachers and were told that
their school had gone out of business and
that they could go either to the Horace
Mann School on Valencia and Twenty
fifth streets, or to the Franklin school on
Eighth street, near Bryant, both insti
tutions eight blocks away.
The boys trampled down to the Horace
Mann and found it crowded. They then
marched to the Franklin, where the same
condition of affairs was encountered.
Then they quit.
A. H. Hutchinson, editor of "Our
Youth," published at 1914 Howard street,
wrote to the Superintendent of Schools
relative to the matter and received the
following reply:
SAX FRANi'lsro, Cal., January 16, IW9.
A. li. Hutchinson. 1914 Howard Street, City-
Dear Sir: Your letter at hanu and permit me
to ea.v in rc:>ly that it is the poliry of the
present Board of Education to, as far as ]Â»<fsi
ble, curtail the expenses of our department. I
find in the Mission Evening Sfhool but .-even
pupils enrolled in the bookkeeping class. To
retain thin teacher and clan* wouiu h.^ m
direct violation of the resolution of the Board
of Education. Classes in Ixiokkeeplnc are
conducted in the Horace Mann Evening Softool,
Lincoln Evening and Business Evening. Those
pupils who were affected by this consolidation
may attend any or these schuols. Trusttng
that you will consider this just. I am, very
respectfully yours, C. W. MAUK,
Deputy Superintendent.
The students have circulated the fol
lowing petition through the Mission
which will be presented to the Board of
Education this evening:
To the Honorable Board of Educationâ We
the undersigned, residents of the Mission,
whose children attend the Mission Night
School, peiition your honorable body not to
elope the same, lor the following reasons:
1. Both the Horace Mann and the Franklin
Schools arp too far away for most of the
children attending to walk to In time, and
workiiiK boys . and girls cannot afford to pay
car fare.
I Both the Horace Mann and the Franklin
BehOOll are bo crowded that it will be impos
sible for additional scholars to obtain neces
Â»ary explanations and personal attention from
the teachers, while large classes are generally
disorderly.
3. The transfer at this time, even If the
scholars could attend, would put the children
back so far In their lessons that It would be
discouraging and might prevent some from
further attempting to obtain an education un
der such discouraging conditions.

The Congregational Club held Its regu
lar dinner last evening at the California
Hotel.. The social assembly preceded th<^
dinner by a half hour. At its conclu
sion the guests sat down to an elegantly I
served repast, which was heartily en- !
joyed. R. H. Chamberlain presided as
the toastmaster of the evening. The
speaker was Rabbi Voorsanger. The tenor
of his address was a comparison of the
times when the world in its political
faiths claimed not the purifying effect of
I Christianity, as compared with the de
i moralizing power of politics of to-day.
It is needless to say that the men of
I to-day suffered by the comparison made
Iby the rabbi. He casually referred to
the present situation at Sacramento, and
said that if this nation was a Christian
nation, as it claimed to be, and the state
of affairs existed at Sacramento as they
! have been represented, that then no can
: didate could be elected as long as man
i retained his honesty. v

THE PEOPLE OWN
THE TRANSFERS
They Have the Undoubted Right o
Give Them Away.
Judge Mogran does not believe in city
ordinances connected with corporations
making unreasonable burdens upon the
citizens, and from that standpoint he yes
terday dismissed the case of Michael
I Freeman, a boilÂ«r-roaker, charged with
giving away a transfer of the Market
l street Railroad Company.
Last Sunday Freeman took a car to the
park, intending to go to the Cliff House.
When he reached Halght and Stanyan
streets he decided to go to the park and
gave his transfer to a teoy. He was ar-
I rested, and the case was argued before
] the Judge yesterday. Attorney Kelly for
the company read the ordinance, which
j sayÃ that no person shall "issue, deliver,
give or sell or offer to deliver, giv^ or
sell any transfer, check or ticket." He
contended that the transfer ticket was
given as a privilege to be used only by
the individual to whom it was issued.
Attorney McGregor for the defendnant
argued that the transfer belonged to the
passenger and he had a right to dispose
of it as he saw fit. The Judge took that'
â¢view of the matter, holding that the
ticket was given in lieu of the nickel. He
said it might bÂ« different with the person
who got the transfer from the passenger,
but that point was not at issue. Ho did
not believe, in ordinances being passed to
impose unreasonable burdens upon the
citizens. He therefore dismissed the case.

SINGULAR STATEMENT.
i â â
From Mrs. Rank to Mrs. Pinkham.
The following letter to Mrs. Pink-
ham from Mrs. M. Rank, No. 2,354
East Susquehanna Aye., Philadelphia,
Pa., is a remarkable statement of re-
lief from utter discouragement. She
says:
"I never can find words with which
to thank you for what Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound has done'
for me.
" Some years ago I had womb trouble
and doctored for a long time, not see-
ing any improvement. s At times I
would feel well enough, and other
times was miserable. So it went on
until last October, I felt something
terrible creeping over me, I knew not
what, but kept getting worse. I can
hardly explain my feelings at that
time. I was so depressed in spirits
that I did , not wish to live, although I
had . everything to live for. Had hys-
teria, was very nervous; could not
sleep and was not safe to be left
alone.
Indeed, I thought I would lose my
mind. No one knows what I endured.
"1 continued this way until the last
of February, when I saw in a paper a
testimonial of a lady whose ease was
similar to mine, and who had been
cured by Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegeta-
ble Compound. I determined to try it,
and felt better after the first dose. I
continued taking it, and to-day am a.
well woman; and can say from my
heart, 'Thank God for such a medi-
cine. " â¢ , â¢ "/'â â ' â  - (

CROWNING DISCOVERY
OF THE CENTURY
A New System of Medicine Discovered by
an Eminent Scientist for the Positive
Cure of Consumption, Lung
Troubles and All Wasting
Diseases.
CONSUMPTION CAN BE CURED.
Do you cough?
Do your lungs pain you?
Is your throat sore ani inflamed?
Do you spit up phlegm?
Does your head ache?
Is your appetite bed?
Are you losing flesh?
Are you pale and thin?
Are your lungs delicate?
Do you lack stamina?
These symptoms are proof that you
have in your body the seeds of th^ most
dangerous malady that has ever devas-
tated the carth â consumption.
Consumption, the bane of i'.k.s? who
have b?en brought up in the ald-fash-
ioned beliefs that this disease was here-
I ditary. that it was fatal, that none
could recover who were un<" firmly
clasped in its relentless grip.
Bur now known to be curable, made
so by the world-vtfrring discoveries of
that mali whose name has bee;i given to
this r.-w system oi" treatment.
Now known to be preventable and
curable by following and practicing his
hygienic teachings.
The new system of medicine will
cure you of consumption and of all dis-
eases which can b- traced back to weak
lungs as a foundation.
It is not a drug system, but a system
of germ annihilation and body building.
Not guesswork, but science.

REVIVING THE
ANIMOSITIES
OF YEARS AGO
Democrats Engage in
a Bitter War.
FIGHTING FOR PARTY CONTROL
DAVIE WILL NOT HUNT A NOM
INATION.
Etill He May Be a CandidateâRepub
licans Are Confident of the
Success of Their
Ticket.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Jan. 24.
With throe conventions yet to he held
there is no lack of interest in municipal
politics Blnce the Republican conven
tion Democrats have been busily trying
to work out a plan of salvation for them
selves. They have not yet succeeded, but
consider that they have almost attained
their desires. Already it is clear that the
party is divided on the old lines, and no
ticket which ran be named will meet with
the support of both faction?.
There is a revival of the discord that
had its birth in th> Murphy-Uudd tight in
the State convention four years at;o.
Since that time the Budd Democrats
have had everything their own way. and
although they have secured for them
selves many fat Federal and State offices
the other faction declares that the party
and its organization in this county have
gone to the canines.
The Fitzgerald wing fears that if the
Laymance wing maintains control of t!ie
convention a ticket will be put up that
t>i< party cannot accept n.s a whole and
that some of the discredited six members
of the Council will bo renominated.
It is interesting to note that three of
the solid six arc Democrats and three .Re
publicans. The Republicans have al
ready repudiated their half of the obnox
ious sextet, and it is expected that 'he
Democrats will do the same. The Lay
man cc wing declares thai if it controls
the convention it will put up the strong
est straight Democratic ticket seen '.n
this city since the times when C D.
Pearce and John H. Glascock were elect
ed to the Mayoralty. They deny that
they have any intention of nominating
any members of the Council who do not
enjoy the confidence of the peopli . and
are boasting that if allowed to they wi.l
name a winning ticket.
The other faction declares that if this

candidate for Mayor, lie by no means in

very much Incensed to-day at an editorial
in a morning paper classing him with the

the records plainly show that he had no
"solid six" in the Council and that not
a single one of hia vetoes was sustained.
"As to being In a conspiracy," he said,
"to secure a nomination from the Inde

not seeking a nomination from any con

Mayor I shaJl run on Davie's record and

fact that It was John L. Davie who
rorced the Southern Pacific Company to
reduce its ferry fares 33 per cent on single

if he be wanted to head the ticket of

A CHARACTER IN
LOCAL HISTORY
Death of William P. Toler, Who Raised the First
American Flag in California*
OAKLAND, Jan. 24.â William P. Toler. the midshipman who first hoisted the
American flag on California soil fifty-two years ago, died at his home on
Albion street this evening. His deatli is attributed to heart failure and
dropsy. He was 73 years of age and leav a a widow and one son.
William P. Toler was born in Venezuela. December 3, 1825. His father
was in the diplomatic service of the United States at Venezuela at that
time, where he married a Spanish lady of that country. Toler was educated
in Virginia, his father's native State. He was appointed a midshipman in the
navy by Henry Clay four years before the naval academy was established. He
came to this coast with Commodore Jones, upon whose staff he was, and im.
mediately upon his arrival at Monterey he landed with a small force on Octo
ber 19, 1542, hauled down the Mexican flag and hoisted the American flag on the
same pole. The soldiers of the Mexican army retired, but Toler and Midship
man Larrentree were ordered to search the office of the Collector or Customs.
In looking about the office Toler stumoled on a small bundle of newspapers that
had been thrown aside and never opened. Upon investigation this proved to
contain late news from the Atlantic side, showing that Commodore Jones had
made a mistake in being premature, and therefore he hauled down the Ameri
can flag again, and on October 28 hoisted the Mexican flag once more, saluted it
and sailed homo.
Four years later Toler was ordered back to Monterey, coming on the staff of
Commodore John D. Sloat, coming ashore with the detachment on July 7, 1846.
At this time the Mexicans had retired and he again hoisted the American flag.
Atter taking possession on behalf of the United States, and after Monterey was
taken, Toler, in command of a "detachment of seamen, erected a log fort.
Mr. Toler resided in Oakland for many years. ills wife was a daughter at
the Peraltas who, at one time, owned nearly all of Oakland. His only sur
viving son, J. Hoyt Toler, is the well-known music teacher.
MAD HORSE RUNS
THROUGH A STORE
LEAVES A TRAIL OF WRECKAGE
ON THE STREET.
Scared by the Local Train the Animal

Oakland Office San Franicsco Call.
908 Broadway, Jan. 124.
A butcher's wagon was hauled into a
I grocery' store on Broadway by a mad
! dened horse this morning and wagon and
; store were wrecked, while the horse sus
tained such severe injury that it be
j came necessary to shoot him.
The rig was owned by Rice & White
and was hitched at Seventh and Broad
! way. Thr driver had .iust untied the horse
and was mounting the seal when the local
train came along. The horse bolted, the
! driver was thrown out and away went the
rig up Broadway. After a few blocks were
: covered one wheel and a portion of the
â  wagon were left In thff' street. On reach
'â . ing Twenty-second street the horse
! rushed through the half-open door of
I Helmke's grocery store. He dragged the
' smashed wagon after him into the store,
wrecking the fruit stand at the entrance
; and breaking everything in his path. By
! the time the horse came to a standstill in
the rear of the store the wagon was badly
shattered. The horse stopped abruptly
i and was led out. but by a peculiar con

that it was considered necessary to shoot
him. Although the rig covered fifteen

to the crib again at about 9 the little one
was dead.
In answer to a question by a iuror, the
witness stated that she had covered her
babe's head with a cotton quilt, as she
was in the habit of doing, and an autopsy
held by Dr. W. B. Church led to the con
clusion that death was due to asphyxia
tion. The young mother also testified that
when she found the baby dead there was
another girl, named Gertie, sick in the
same room. Thjs girl, beside others, is
now to be subpenaed, and the inquest was
continued until next Thursday night.

Reliance Benefit.

The well-known Orphous and Hughes

ROBERTS IS
A DISGRACE
TO CONGRESS
Oakland Women De
cry Polygamy.
PETITION SENT TO METCALF
ADVOCATES NO COMPROMISE
WITH BIGAMY.
The Convention Declares That Utah
Is No Longer Deserving of
a Place in the
Union.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Jan. 24.
A large audience of representative
women gathered at Reed Hall this even
ing to protest against the seating of Con
gressman-elect Brlgham H. Roberts of
Utah. The meeting was organized with
the election of Mrs. Sarah C. Borland as
president and Mrs. Ella Hughes as secre
tary.
Miss Pierce, who* had spent some time
in Utah and knew people and conditions
"there, was the first speaker.
She gave a detailed account of Roberts"
life, showing him as one of the theological
leaders of Mormonism. Attention was
called to his imprisonment in the peniten
tiary for polygamy, also to the fact that
he was not a regularly enfranchised citi
zen, since he could not avail himself of
the amnesty granted by President Cleve
land, never having given up polygamy.
Reference was aJso made to Roberts'
many wives and to> the children born from
plural marriages since Utah had become
a State. The twins so historic in the
Utah campaign were alluded to, as evi
dence that the compact with the nation
had not been kept as far as the Utah
statesman was concerned. The quotation
from the twins caused much merrimentâ
"Ha, ha, ha; he's my pa. He's going to
Washington, but he won't take ma!
This was a campaign cry in Utah.
The ultimate aim of Aformonism was
fully set forth, as was the old threat of
Brigham Young that "He would yet cram
polygamy down the throats .of the Ameri
can people." Extracts from speeches of
the elders of the Mormon church were
read to show that polygamy was a live
issue in the Mormon church, and that
Utah had not kept up to the promise
made when she was allowed to join the
sisterhood of States.
Miss Plerce'a paper was well received
and she was followed by Mrs. Louise Cock
roft, who read a newspaper article, writ
ten by Eugene Young, grandson of Brig
ham Young. It contained a powerful ap
peal for the down-trodden women of Utah
and showed in strong pictures the am
bition of the Mormon leaders and the ulti
mate ends to be attained by them. It was
not a question of a man, but of a princi
ple. The defense of polygamy had been
carefully worked out, and the return of
Roberts to the House of Representatives
was a challenge from Utahâ and a recog
nition by the nation of polygamy, the
cornerstone of the Mormon religion. It
was a ringing address, powerfully read
by Mrs. Cockroft.
Mrs. H. B Plnney gave a short talk,
outlining the methods by whtch the Mor
mons attained their ends. She told a story
of a prominent pyysiclan who lived in a
little town In Utah, who, though a Mor
mon, did not practice polygamy. But as
soon as Utah was a State and there was
no longer need for secrecy, he Introduced
his other wives and their families to the
community. Mrs. Plnney also pointed out
the shrewd, underhand way in which the
Mormon tries to attain his ends, and
thought, in view of the ,facts, the time
had come for the women of the nation
to take a stand in defense of the homes
of the nation.
Mrs. Granville Abbott, president of the
Red Cross Society, was the next speaker.
She referred to the fact that strong, active
protests would deepen into action. There
was no doubt of the shock to the moral
sentiment of the nation by the Insult that
; had been put upon it. It was the day of
I corrupt politics. The politicians were in
! the ascendency and in power; still the in
| dignant protest of the nation would be
listened to by the lawmakers if it were
; loud enough. The election of Roberts was
; an insult to the sacredness of the home.
Mrs. George Babcock gave her observa
tions of Mormon life and Mormon work
during a stay in Salt Lake, and pointed
out how fatal a mistake it was to trust
to Mormon integrity by taking Utah into
the Union.
Mrs. MeCleas spoke of the duty which
women owed the nation in this crisis.
They had not votes, but they had influ
ence. Each woman could work actively
iin her own circle, and the aggregate
| would roll up such a mass of influence
that no body of men would disregard it.
It would horrify the new Congressman
when he came to take his seat.
The sentiment of the meeting was fully
expressed that the election of Brigham
H. Roberts was a direct insult to the
citizens of the nation; that the women of
I the nation felt keenly the lowering of the
home standard which it would mean. A
polygamist could never legislate for the
American women. Two methods were
i suggestedâ one to prevent Congressman
elect Roberts from taking his seat by
I proving that he was not eligible, not a
; citizen, since he believed in polygamy and
had practiced it against the laws of the
United States. The other method related
to expelling Roberts from the House, the
i only danger In the latter course lying in
the fact that it would require a two-thirds
vote of the House, and there could be no
certainty of that.
Messages were received from Mrs. Rob
ert Watt. Mrs. Alexander Martin and Mrs.
John Yule, expressing their sympathy in
the movement inaugurated.
The members are preparing to circulate
petitions everywhere in Oakland, so that
I the memorial shall be the most extensive
| one ever prepared on this side of the bay.
The heading of each petition reads as
i follows:
To the Hon. Victor H. Metcalf. Member of
Congress from the Third Congressional Dis
trictâSir: We. the undersigned, voters In the
City of Oakland, State of California, believing
that it if contrary to the laws of the United
States and In defiance of the moral .sense of
citizens to allow Hrigham H. Roberts, Con
gressman-elect from Utah, to take his seat,
do hereby urge you to use your vote and in
fluence to exclude him.
"FOUND NO GAMBLING."
. i
Police Look for Games of Chance, but :
Find "Only Poker and Keno."
OAKLAND, Jan. 24.â Chief of Police
Fletcher reports that he has. investigated
the story told by a City Councllm'an that
several gambling games are running in
this city and finds "nothing in It."
He had Sergeant Peterson search the
east side of Broadway last night, and Ser
geant Scanlan the west side, and both j
reported that no games were running, at j
least none prohibited by law.
There were poker and keno games in the
rear of cigar stores and saloons, wnieh. it i
is claimed, are not prohibited by the gen
eral anti-gambling laws.
Moreover, the Chief says that he has
received protests from several reputable
business men against stopping these
games, on the ground that gambling Is
going on In full blast in San Fram Isco |
and Oaklanders would therefore take
thell money across the bay and drop it.
Run Over by a Beer Wagon.
OAKLAND. Jan. 24.â Edward Uep. an
upholsterer residing at t">9l- Twenty-eighth
street, had a very narrow escape from be
ing crippled for life by a beer wagon to
day. Mr. Liep was crossing at Webster
and Thirteenth streets when he whs
fcnor.ked down by two horses attached to
a beer wagon, which ran over him. The
Jolt caused several kegs of beer to topple
down off the wagon and one of these
burst its contents, giving Mr. Liep a thor
ough drenching. The driver quickly drove
off before the injured man could learn his
name. At the Receiving Hospital Llep
was treated for a sprained ankle and nu
merous bruises.

A Significant Water Rate Voteâ A
City Chemist.
OAKLAND, Jan. 24.-The City Council
went on record to-night on water rates.
Glrard introduced a resolution declaring
that the January bills of the Contra Costa
and Dingee companies were twice the
size of any previous bills and should not
be paid. Girard argued in favor of his
motion and Woodward tried to shift
the matter by moving as a substitute
that the bills be sent back to the
Board of Public Works. The substi
tute failed of passage. Woodward
spoke long against the resolution and
quoted law and took Issue with the City
Attorney and finally Rowe and Girard
demanded a vote. Girard. Rowe, Cuvel
lier. Pringle and Upton voted not to pay
the bills. Henneberry, Watkinson and Earl
votedagainst the resolution and Woodward
asked to be excused. This was objected
to and Woodward, being forced to declare
himself finally, declined to vote. Ilelt
man and Brosnahan were absent.

office of City Chemist. The appointment
is to be filled by the Board of Health.

Want a Western Coach.
BERKELEY, Jan. 24.â It is quite likely
that a University of California man may
go to Michigan as athletic coach for one
of the colleges there. Professor Walter
E. Magee, director of physical culture at
Berkeley, has received a letter from Al
bion College, Michigan, asking him to
recommend a man to coach the baseball
and track teams for the spring term. The
letter also asks for a permanent instruc
tor to direct the work of physical cul
ture at the college, the condition befrig
that the instructor be a man with good
athletic record. Professor Magee has
taken the matter under consideration and
may recommend a U. C. student for the
place.

In his sermon the Bishop of Salt Lake

"We meet on the eve ofthe conversion
of St. Paul in the extreme western city

years of church work in California, the
foundation of which was l^id by the Apos

the first Bishop of this State. May he
have eternal rest.
"The closing years of the nineteenth
century witness great things for the
fhurch in California. With the construc

and Hawaii, the Pacific Coast will assume
an Importance it has never had before.
There will com* work for us in bringing
men and women to the lovo of God. It is
a call to :i new effort, but we need the
incentive of an ideal. We need an exam

"We must expand and grow, as we shall

be roused into new activity. Let us work
for expansion. The church will be strong

The Lord Bishop of Columbia was call
ed upon to address the delegates and
said in part: "It is with deep pleasure
that I testify my appreciation of being
allowed to be present among you. I suc
ceeded Bishop Hills as Bishop of Colum
bia in 1892, when I was called to assume
part of his Jurisdiction. It is a coinci
dence that the province of British Co
lubbia has three Bishops, just as this
province has three. Your hospitality and
kindness quite overwhelm me, and I
trust that I will go back to my diocese
refreshed and prepared to do better
work."
The distinguished divine then read a
letter from Dr. Temple, Archbishop of
Canterbury, in which the latter wrote:
"I rejoice at your invitation to be pres
ent at the consecration. It shows that
there is a good understanding with our
brothers in the United States. God has
given the churches in America a great
mission, and the Bishops are pressing on
to a full discharge of the duty with
splendid zeal."
In a similar strain the Archbishop of
Ruperts Land wrote to Bishop Perrin:
"Express for me to the Bishops presid
ing at the consecration the sympathies of
the church of Canada with the growth
and expansion of the American church
and my prayer that the Holy Spirit may
be given in such fullness to the new
Bishop of Sacramento that he may be a
great blessing to his diocese."
Major Hooper's resolutions that the
thanks of the convention be conveyed to
the Archbishops of Canterbury and Ru
perts Land for the kind messages of
grace and good cheer received by the
Lord Bishop of Columbia were adopted
by a rising vote.
Bishop Abiel Leonard addressed the
convention and expressed the hope that
the church of the Pacific coast would
march to that high plane which God has
designed for her.
The report of the treasurer. William A.
M. Van Bokkelen, showed a healthy con
dition of finances. The Bishop's salary
fund showed total receipts of $3497 17, of
which $63 84 represents the balance on
hand to new account. The convention
fund has $1(516 46 to its credit. The mis
sionary fund shows disbursements of
$6189 88 and receipts of $4931 79. leaving a
shortage for eight months of $258 09. The
disabled clergy fund shows $16,570 92 in
the hands of the investment committee"
widows' and orphans' fund, $11,493 07; en-
dowment fund. $15,295 S6; memorial bed
fund in Security Savings Bank, $643 36-
San Mateo endowment fund in Mutual
Savings Bank, $145: Eastman educational
fund, in three banks. $4201 80. Total as
sets on hand, $48,618 31.
Major Noble, aid to Major General
Shafter, was called upon for a few re
marks and said: "I really felt more com
fortable under the fire of the Spaniards
than I do making a speech before this
august body. I have a feeling of thank
fulness in my heart in this return to my
home and church. I will say that beau
tiful memorial services were held over the
graves of those who died in Santiago, un
der the auspices of the Brotherhood of
St. Andrew, of which I am a member."
Bishop Nichols then read his annual
address and explained that the reports
covered a period of only eight months,
since the time of the convention had been
constitutionally changed from Easter to
the present month. He stated that Cali
fornia was the only State in which church
property was taxed, and it was the in
tention to submit a measure to the peo
ple and to the Legislature, asking for
needed relief in the matter. The diocese
was In splendid condition and with the
expansion policy of the Government was
bound to have new opportunities of
spreading the faith of Christ. It is the
mission of the church to keep pace with
the progress of the nation. He referred
feelingly to the death of several Episco
pal divines, and also to the consecration
of Bishop-elect Moreland. He spoke of
the semi-centennial celebration in 1900 and
the general convention to be held in this
city in 1901, at which questions of momen
tous import would be decided.
The convention then adjourned until
this afternoon at St. Paul's Church.

KILL'S FIGHT
IS DECLARED
TO BE A DRAW
Plainly Has Better of
McConnell.
REFEREE RULED OTHERWISE
Short-Enter Tried to Mix Things.
Cocker Tweedie Too Much for
Tye and Won in the
Fifteenth.
The National Club managers had oc
casion to smile last evening when they
feasted their eyes on the large gather
ing of sport lovers who witnessed the
three fistic battles in Woodward's Pa
vilion.
Frank McConnell and Al Neill fought
twenty rounds, and the referee, Jim
McDonald, called it a draw, notwith
standing that Neill was entitled to the
decision. However, if McDonald had
given judgment In favor of Neill he
would certainly have received a rally of
hisses from the sports who had wagered
on McConnell, who sold a favorite at
$10 to $6.
Tim Hurst of baseball fame refereed
the fifteen-round bout between "Cock
er" Tweedle, who is a relative of Young
Griffo, and Charley Tye of Oakland.
Hurst proved himself to be the right
man in the right place. In other words,
he Is a first-class referee of fistic con
tests, and his decision favoring Tweedie
was well received.
The bout between "Jockey" Mavnard
and Willie Cole was far from beine
satisfactory. Maynard is a cunning
lad and he certainly fought under pool- j
box rules. He trained with the view of
becoming perfect in "faking" a knock
out, and to the unsophisticated his act
last evening was quite clever.
Immediately following the second
preliminary contest Professor Billy Jor
dan, the man of stentorian voice, in
troduced Frank McConnell and Al Neill.
McConnell looked as if he had trained
down too fine, and judging from his
style of light, he certainly appeared as
If he had gone stale.
Neill, on the other hand, was perfect
physically. He is a much stronger man
than McConnell, and may eventually
work his way to the top of the pugilistic
ladder. The knowing ones, who pre
dict winners, were very much surprised
when they saw how Neill performed be
fore his more experienced opponent.
They were very sanguine that McCon
nell would place Mr. Neill In the land
of dreams inside of ten rounds, but
their surprise can be imagined when
they saw Neill take the aggressive from
the start and by go-od, hard punching
and clever stopping put his opponent
all but out in the sixth round. Had
Neill been more experienced in ring
generalship, he certainly would have
won the contest in the early rounds of
the game.
In the first round McConnell was the
aggressor. He took matters easy, as he
evidently thought it was only a ques
tion of a few rounds when he would
drop his opponent by placing his trusty
right on the chin. During the round
Neill proved that he was no slouch, and
his foot work was far superior to that
of his opponent.
In the second round Neill let out a
link, and he returned blow for blow,
holding his own with Me. In the
third and fourth rounds Neill sur
prised McConnell. Instead of acting
on the defensive he forced matters and
landed several times on McConnell's
face, occasionally sending home a
good, stiff right under McConnell's
guard.
The contest waxed very warm !n the
fifth round and Neill had McConnell on
the retreat. In fact, McConnell was on
the run and the gallery gods shouted at
him to stand his ground and fight. In a
hot rally near the finish of the round
McConnell planted a hard left on Neill's
nose, drawing first blood.
The sixth round was the most excit
ing of any. Neill, evidently under ad
vice from his attendants, went right at
his quarry and there was a hot mix-up
at close range. Both fighters tried their
utmost to score a knock-out blow, but
McConnell was hitting wild while Neill
was planting good straight lefts antf
short-arm rights on McConnell's face
and neck. McConnell, in an attempt to
side-step a wicked right chop, slipped
and as he pulled himself together Neill
caught him a left-hand jolt on the chin
and a right-hander under the ear
which sent McConnell to the floor.
He remained down nine seconds, and
Neill, who was watching the count,
pointed his finger at the referee, say
ing: "Why don't you call him out? He
is down more than ten seconds." In the
meantime McConnell regained his pins
and made a vicious lunge at Neill, who
ducked the blow, and McConnell again
fell on his knees. He remained down
only a few seconds, but the fight was
resumed when he again toed the scratch
and several hard blows were exchanged
at very short range.
Just before the gong sounded the men
to corners, McConnell caught Neill the
hardest smash that he administered
during the fight. It was a risrht-hand
swing in the mouth, which caused Neill
to see stars.
The seventh round was tolerably ex
citing. Neill was anxious to land a
knockout blow and he flung rights and
lefts at his antagonist. One of the
blows landed a bit low and McConnell
appealed to the referee, who said
"Fight on."
The fighters hammered away at close
range; it seemed as If a finishing touch
would momentarily result.
Neill's pace slowed perceptibly after
this round, but nevertheless McConnell
had a wholesome respect for his op
ponent's "dukes" and fought at long
range. Time and again Me tried to
land his right, but his judgment was
not good and the glove landed every
where except on the vulnerable spot.
In fact, McConnell depends altogether
on his right to win the long green. His
left is very poor.
Neill has two good hands, and he out
classed McConnell in straight hitting,
leading and footwork. Neither man
sustained any serious damage.
Jockey Maynard went down to de
feat in the fourth round of his contest
with Willie Cole, the hard-hitting youth
from the Manhattan Athletic Club. In
the first round Cole took the aggressive
and sent several well-aimed lefts to
Maynard's face. Maynard retaliated
with a right counter on Cole's jaw, and
there was a bit of clever sparring in the
center of the ring. The third and
fourth rounds were lively affairs. In
the fourth Maynard rushed Cole. They
clinched and the jockey went to the
floor and was counted out. If Cole
landed a knockout punch on his oppo
nent those occupying seats close to the
ringside failed to notice it. At any rate
Maynard when he struck the inviting
canvas covered his face with both
hands and lay there in a contented
fashion until his seconds dragged him
to his corner. His eyes were closed and
to all appearances he was knocked out,
but when Spider Kelly shoved a vial
of strong ammonia under the nose of
the apparently unconscious youth he
kicked and fought like a madman.
It was "handed" around town before
the fight by the wise ones that Cole was
"easy money" as Maynard intended to
"lay down." His subsequent actions
certainly gave color to the rumor.
The fifteen-round contest between
"Cocker" Tweedie and Charlie Tye was
really the event of the evening:. It
was certainly the fastest fifteen rounds
that the old clock in Woodward's Pa
vilion ever ticked off.
Tweedie, though a warm favorite in
the betting, far exceed expectations.
He proved himself to be one of the
cleverest" and fastest two-hand fighter
that has performed in this city for a
long time. He seemed to have count
less hands all landing on Tye's body at
the same time. The entire fifteen
rounds could be easily described by
saying that Tweedie punched the Oak
land man a thousand times and the
Oakland man came back for that many
more.
The Australian has a most peculiar
method of fighting, and during the fif
teen rounds he introduced many inno
vations into the game that turned the
spectators more topsyturvy than they
did Tye. His circua-like tactics were
both effective and amusing. The Oak
land man took Tweedle's double and
triple-action punches on the body and
face from the moment the gong clanged
in the first round until the welcome
slogan sounded to cease hostilities.
Tye's face looked as if some experi
enced butcher had been practicing on
it with a new meat ax, so badly was he
punished. Tye fought his up-hill bat
tle gamely. He was puzzled and rattled
more perhaps by the Australian's pe
culiar antics than he was by the trip
hammer thumps that the Cocker kept
sending in on his face and body. The
men agreed to hit with one arm free,
which literally means "keep punching
away until the referee separates you."
This agreement gave the Cocker un
limited scope to display his wonderful
dexterity with both hands and feet.
In the first round Tye lashed out with
his left and caught Tweedie a hot
smash on the side of the face. The
Cocker smiled, and as they were com
ing out of a clinch Tweedie started his
both hands going like a donkey engine,
landing right and left on Tye's jaw.
The Oakland man looked worried, but
he came back quickly with a left hook
on the Cocker's head, which shook him
up. Tweedie smiled, and a^ain started
his fists In motion. He simply smoth
ered Tye with punches, and then
danced away with one of those "Oh, I
guess I'm bad" expressions in his eyes.
From the second to the tenth round
Tweedie kept pegging away at his op
ponent's ribs and head, but the Oak
land lad stood up well under the ter
rible shower of blows. He contented
himself with lashing out with his right
once in a while in a vain endeavor to
catch the Cocker on the point and end
the battle. Once in the fifth round Tye
got home solidly with his right and for
a moment it looked as if he had a
chance to terminate the bout in his
favor.
Tvreedie rallied quickly, however, and
went back again at his quarry with
more vim than before. He changed off
from Tye's body to the jaw with light
ning rapidity. A disconsolate glare
shone In Tye's eyes, but he came back
to the fray after each mixup as If he
liked the game. He had a forlorn hope
in his trusty right and took some des
perate chances to lajid It in a vital
spot, but every time he let it go the
Cocker had his right glove nestled
snugly under his jaw, ready to smoth
er It.
The last five rounds of the bout were
faster than the first ten. Tye knew his
only chance, and he kept lying low for
an opportunity to send it in.
Tweedie either did not know that Tye
was gifted with a dangerous right or
he did not care a rap. He stepped
into close quarters with his opponent
and kept whanging away with right
and left, never even stopping; to spar
for wind.
In the final round Tweedie had Tye
all but out. He rushed the Oakland
man to the ropes and beat a tattoo on
his bruised body. Tye clinched to
save himself and Referee Tim Hurst
had to break them away. The gong
found Tweedie walloping Tye in the
ribs with stiff right Jabs. Hurst mo
tioned both fighters to their corners
and decided the bout in Tweedie's fa
vor. The decision was popular in all
sections of the house. When Tye left
the ring he was roundly cheered for his
display of gameness.
The Betting.
Betting on the contests was unusually
brisk yesterday at Harry Corbett's
poolroom on Ellis street. McConnell
was a hot favorite at prevailing odds
of ten to seven. Very little money
changed hands on the Maynard-Cole
bout, it being reported that Maynard
intended to lie down. Tweedie was a
big favorite over Tye. auctions being
offered on the bout at ten to four,
Tweedie favorite.
