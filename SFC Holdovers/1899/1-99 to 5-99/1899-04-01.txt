TROOPS TO REST AT MALOLOS AND
THEN PURSUE AGUINALDO.
MANILA, April I.â General
Mac Arthur, evidently un
der advices from headquarters,
seems to have decided to give his
troops a good rest and enable
them to replenish their equip
ment before pursuing Aguin
aldo's phantom army, which the
scouts report is making an ef
fort at reorganization on the rail
way north of Calumpit.
It was expected that orders to
march would be given this morn
ing, but instead the general seems
to be making preparations for an
extended stay. What is left â¢of
the city is being policed and put
in order, as though for a perma
nent camp. Though not offi
cially announced, it is believed
that .vlalolos will henceforth â be
headquarters, and that future
movements against, the insur
gents, whether as an organized
army or as guerrilla bands, will be
directed from there. Fresh troops
have been ordered , up, but
whether as reinforcements or to
take the place of those regiments
which have been in the field from
the first, is not known. â â !
Present indications are that the
campaign in the north . will . be
long drawn out, as the country is
very badly cut up with deep
watercourses, boggy marshes and
dense jungles. V. 7.-;^.
Mac Arthur was six days : . in
reaching Malolos, averaging
nearly four miles daily. While it
is not expected the insurgents
will make such resistance in the
future as in the past, what will be
gained in that respect will be
overcome by increased difficul
ties of travel. The work of re
pairing* the railroad, which was
torn up f or a mile out of MaJolos,
was practically completed last
night irf expectation that â¢ a for
ward movement would be begun
this morning. ,-,-â¢'". ''':''
-' , The- pacificos -have already be
gun returning to Malolos. The
Peace Commissioners have not
issued the proclamation prom
ised on the fall of Malolos, as they
probably realize there can be no
peace until Aguinaldo is cap-,
tured.
THE STORY OF THE
FALL OF MALOLOS
Rebels Themselves Knew They Could
Not Stand Against the
Americans.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1833. by James Gor
don Bennett.
MANILA, March 31.â Malolos, the
Insurgent capital, was taken by
the American army this morn
ing after a short fight. The line
formed for the advance in the
following order, from left to right:
Third Artillery, First Montana, Twen
tieth Kansas, Tenth Pennsylvania,
First South Dakota and First Ne
braska, with Wheaton's brigade held
back as support.
At twenty minutes to 7 o'clock the
artillery began shelling the insurgent
trenches, which were one mile north
on the line of railway. The shelling
continued for half an hour. Severe I
shells were thrown into Malolos 3700
yards away. A sharp Mauser fire an
swered, but speedily subsided and the
trenches were silent.
The Nebraska and Pennsylvania reg
iments w~;re then thrown forward on
the right flank and met a hot flreS^ The
left wing advanced cautiously through
the thickets and open fields, finding no
sign of the enemy, and finally reach
ing the outskirts of Malolos.
Colonel Funston of the Kansas Regi
ment, with a small detachment of
troops, advanced beyond the firing line
and saw that Aguinaldo's headquar
ters had been fired. "-'The American sol
diers went yelling down the street to
ward the principal* square. Several In
effective shots greeted them from a
stone, barricade at.-.the head of the
street, but the troops rush-Si on, the
insurgents fleeing.
The city was found to be burning, but
the troops speedily took possession of
it. The utmost confusion prevailed.
The Chinese were flocking back into
the city, and the â¢terrified insurgents
were firing parting volleys as, they re.
treated and the troops were returning
their fire.
When the troops reached the center
of the city, the Presidencia was in
flames and the Filipinos were fleeing in
â¢error toward the mountains. The
American loss was one killed and fif
teen wounded, according to the official
report. r It is believed here that the
rebels cannot in the future make even
a slight resistance to the Americans. .
It is evident that the rebels for some
time past have abandoned all hope of
holding' their capital, for the Ameri
cans found there evidences of elaborate
preparations for evacuation. On the
railroad the rails and ties for about a
mile had : been torn up and: probably
thrown Into the river. The only pris
oners captured were a few Chinamen.

The only effective stand -made by the

was the first man In Malolos, followed
by a group of dashing Kansans.
The Filipino flag, which was flying
from the center of the town, was hauled
down by â  some of the Montana regi
ment, who subsequently raised their
own above It. From the. columns of
smoke arising from the city it seemed
as If the whole place was ablaze. It
turned out, ' however, that only the

and a few of the smaller buildings had
been set fire to by the rebels ' before

army Is constantly, losing strength on
account of the desertions, and that al
though the enemy may make one or two
more stands, the forces of Aguinaldo
will degenerate in perhaps a month to
a few hundred, who may continue
guerrilla warfare in the mountains.
, The American r troops behaved . splen
didly. They, advanced steadily against
successive- lines of trenches, through
woods and jungles while suffering from
frightful heat.
In addition, the American volunteers
were handicapped in fighting by. the
fact that their Springfield rifles are of
shorter range than the Mausers in the
hands of .the rebels. .Under those cir
cumstances the steady advance of our
troops is a really, remarkable achieve
ment. &__E____BnÃ
But the most noteworthy feature of
this onward sweep of the Americans is
the patience and endurance of the, pri
vate soldiers. They have never hesi
tated to plunge across any kind of dif
ficult country, against any number, of
the enemy and in the face of the posi
tions of entirely unknown strength.
Recently; issued copies of the â¢ Repub
lica Filipino, Aguinaldo's .'official or
gan, contain a proclamation to the * ef
fect that certain parties are raiding the
northern towns, and ordering them to
join the Filipino army immediately or
take the consequences, when Agui
naldo shall have finished with the
Americans. i /* 5 *-â *.'â¢' .;.
â  This is construed as /meaning that
Makaboulos, the Governor of the five
northern * provinces, is unfriendly to
Aguinaldo. V If â  this be* true, Aguinaldo's
retreat is undoubtedly cut off at the
railroad beyond San Fernando.
' The Republica Filipino : on March 23
published :an extra edition, containing
a statement to the effect 7. that â  the
Americans had attacked Pasig, that
many of - them were - killed - and -' a - ma
jority of the remainder were wounded,
while 180 of them were taken prisoners.
â¢ A second paragraph in the. same edi
tion asserted that the Americans had
ravished . 300 of the Filipinos' fairest
daughters, and called .upon the natives
to "defend their honor with their lives
against oppressors who spared neither
age, sex nor condition, murdering whole
families in cold-blooded revenge." Â°'\
- General Hall's brigade . advanced to
day ' from Mariquina up the .Mateo

driving the enemy to* the hills in the
north. The rebels were in considera

the American artillery soon ' scattered
them with heavy loss. The â  American
loss was one killed, Lieutenant* Gregg,

NEVADA CITY, March 31.â Special
Policeman "William H. Kilroy, one of
the most fearless and popular peace of

at an undertaker's to-night \ with two
bullet wounds just below the heart and

The killing occurred* twenty minutes
before 1 o'clock this morning. The men
met at the corner of Broad and Pine
streets, in the business center of the
city. Officer Kilroy had long suspected
Moore of committing various burglaries
of local saloons. Moore realized that
Kilroy shadowed him whenever' he
came to town, and frequently said 'â  he
would "fix" Kilroy if : he did not quit.
As they met this morning they had
heated words. Moore applied vile epi

of the Fighting at .
Manila.
STANFORD. March 31. âA letter dated
February 11 has been received here from
David Burnett, who is with Battery A.
Utah Artillery. Burnett was Stanford's
big center in the football team. He says
his lot is cast among strangers and adds:
"But 1 have not disgraced old Stanford."
He continues: .* â¢
I have pulled the lanyard every time our j
ICaxim-Nordet-feidt has spoken, and it has â 
never made a move that I have not given a
hand. Our battery has been quite lucky; and I.
so far has lost only three men. killed, arid, they j
were with my detachment of four gun.:.* .The
fighting began Saturday, night. February. 4. 'It
was drawing' along toward tap's and â¢we were.; \
lounging around quarters talking, on .the prob
abilities of an early return home, as our major ;
had already received an order to that effect a
few days previously, and we expected to be.
churning along on an old transport with ''olden
Gate as our destination Our quarters were
only a little over a half mile from the line
where the two armies were* drawn upâ ours in
the open; the Filipinos behind intrenchments.
Suddenly a. shot rang nut on the night air, i
and a few scattered shots were followed by a !
rattling volley. The fur. had started. Alt
along the line red rocketsâ sign of an at
tackâshot across the sky. Every man sprang |
to his post. There were blanched faces and i
trembling hands. Officers and orderlies were
running about giving orders. Once in a while. I
a soldier would break in with "The moonlight* 3
fair to-night along the Wabash." The bullets
were striking the sides and roof of our quar- i
ters and coming through the windows. Along
the road were long lines of dusty-looking sol- j
diers, marching out to the front. One by one;
our guns rattled out to take positions along .
__* line, and soon their hollow boom was
W-ard loud above the regular volley firing of j
Irne Infantry. Our guns were still left in camp ;
'and we champed in restraint like tethered
steed; for of all horrible things the woist is to
bo left behind when fighting is going on at the i
front.
We little knew we would be soon under one
of the hottest fires encountered in the first two ,
days' fighting. Our two batteries work twelve I
guns, and by daylight all were out on the lines j
except two. and 1 served one of them. Wr.
were held as a reserve to strengthen any part |
of the line which happened to need support.
Boon after daylight we received orders to go
to the aid of the Nebraskas at Santa Mesa.
The Insurgents occupied San Juan Hill, which
Is heavily wooded and strongly fortified with
trenches and blockhouses. The San Juan Klver
runs at the bottom of this hill and divided the
two armies. Santa Mesa, occupied by the \*--
braskans. was a smooth slope stretching away
three-quarters of. a r.iiie from the r;ve,r. The
river was spanned by a stone bridge. I may
add here that th- position heir*, by the enemy
was considered Invulnerable and was a historic
battle ground, having figured in every war
which has taken place here.
Just at dawn we -started with our two guns
(and they were dreams, captured from the
Spanish, and of the latest model). We had to
Ura_: the guns four gnllea by hand, but we
jerked them along at a merry pace. Along
the read wo passed regiment after regiment.
They gave us rousing cheers and we answered
them with the wave of the hat, as we had no
breath to spareâ we were going at double time
and the guns were heavy.
At last we came to the firing line. For a
half-mile back the bullets had been drooling
around us. At every side were great columns
of black smoke where villages were burning.
a little v. our right the Pasig, where *.v. had
a tug fitted up a.- a gunboat. Its machine guns
were making a horrible din. To the front our
two guns and the Xebraskans were in a hot
place, while on our left the Insu nt? were
making a determined attack upon our lines.
They were returning the fire volley ior volley,
and I tell you the noise was simply tremendous.
We were right in the crater of the battle and
litter after litter passed us with the dead and
wounded, hut we pushed on In a sort of a
dream, passing ever toward the front.
Finally we came up *.-. our first two guns,
ihe boys had Just carried a dead comrade
away. We grasped hands, but barely had time
to exchange a few words when we went on
again. The stone bridge was a point of vant
age which both sides coveted, and we settled
the question by planting oar two guns on it.
We had in advance down an open road for
three-quarters of a mile and we had the com
bined flre of the Filipinos upon US. At last
we reached tin- bridge an.: threw our guns
around: for action. Insurgent ' sharpshooters
lay in rifle pit* in the cant-brakes within 100
yards of us. The bullets were striking all
around us nnd several of the boys were hit.
All the bays got under cover except A few
of us, who remained at the guns. The infantry
law down under the bridge and along under a
raised read that ran 'up the hill from the
bridge. Every few minutes we would rim our
guns a tew yards up the hill by hand, .every
body who saw us said they thought we could
not hold our position ten minutes, and would
all be killed. The brow Of the hill above *â¢â .*..
a sheet of smoke and flame. On our right the
woods were full of sharpshooters.
Our Infantry advanced up the hill, using the
raised roads as a breastwork, and poured vol
ley after volley across the routl in front of us
to protect our right. It was a beautiful sight,
that long sheet of flame and smoke rolling up
in front of us. Every gun went together, for
these volunteers are veterans now.
The few of us -it the guns were almost ex
hausted ana finally began ... grumble at one
another for not doing his share when we liatl
to run the gun to â â -. new position, or -wins
her around in another direction. We never
thought of about fifteen of our gun crew lying
around In protected spots. It seemed as though.
that was the proper thing for them to do. .When
tin- fight first began I handed my canteen to
one of the boys lying near me. It was In my
way. Wa went on and I thought _ -would die
for the want of a Ink. The other fellows
had drunk all of heir water. After everything
had quieted and X had about decided to live
â¢without water the man to- whom 1 had handed
my ennt>-Â«:i came on and gave it to me.
While we were holding the bridge our two
â¢runs back of us on the hill were throwing
shrapnel over our heads on to the enemy, and
1 tell you : was sweet music to our cars to
near those big shells whistling over our heads
and bursting lust ahead of us with ,1 shriek
that sounded the death knell to numerous na
tives. Kfi| 1 1 i fm in ' IllMllllftHllNI 1
At last we got theM lining and the Ncbras-
Vane took the brow <-.{ the hill with a dash.
By this time we had but three shells left, so
we saved them for an emergency, and, draw-
I ing our revolvers, began to plug away at some
I sharpshooters be-in. the stone wall. 100 yards
distant. 'We soon drove them out. The dead
were lyinjg all about us-, and burning shacks
were on every side.
-We were standing on a road, keeping our
eves- open tor sharpshooters, when we saw two
not over a hundred "feet trom us rise ud to
shoot. Before they could shoot some Tennes
set- boys by my side lilled them with lead.
One of the boys walked over and picked up a
rifle, remarking as he came back:
â¢Wall I kinder sorter hated to shoot those
fellows, but I reckon it had ter be -id. They
had ter die sometime, anyhow."
The artillery seldom get to see any of their
work, but we were right in the thick of it for
a time. I saw our boys shoot a sharpshooter
as we reached tho top of the hill. He Jumped
I out of his hiding place and sprang away like
! a deer down the hill. A haif-dozen tipring-
I fields rang out an.i the sharpshooter's last leap
landed hlra ln eternity. j
Along in the afternoon we reached the top of
' the hill and planted our guns out on a point
where the hot tropical sun boat down upon us
fierr-elv. Toward evening we got a little foodâ
bread and canned horseâ the first bite I had
since the night before.
Jit evening we moved outside an inclosure
abHut a great stone reservoir, which was cov
er*',- and made a sort of a fortress. I went onÂ»
gtirird at dark, with a raging headache and a
sor\* throat to keep me company. Firing was
goi'ig on all _,bout us, but a fellow soon be
comes accustomed to such thing 3 and pays but
little attention to them. During the night our
other two guns came up.
The next morning (Monday, February 6) we
began another advance. Inside of a mile we
were again on the firing hue. The first intima
tion we had of this was a shower of bullets
from our left. A ditch runs along by the side
of the road there and we all plunged into it.
The Insurgents sent up a yell of delight, as
they evidently thought .they had killed all
o f lIS - - . -Â. _ .
- Our Infantry had dropped down the hill below

Our guns were always on the skirmish line.
A half mile back the enemy made their last
stand ,and for a half hour they held their
ground like men. They were on a wooded
ridge crowned with fortifications, and had to
be driven out at the point of the bayonet. Some
of them would actually hold their ground until
our boys were within twenty feet of them be
fore they would runâ and then God pity them.
Our boys are brave, and I want to say right
here that the grandest sight ever permitted a
mortal to gaze upon is to see a thin skirmish
line walk up In the face of a withering fire;
not a man faltering; the line advancing with a
mechanical precision as though it is on exhi
bition drill.* Once In a while a gflp ls made; a
couple of arms are thrown in the air for an
instant, a. fleck of cardinal leaps. out on the
blue shirt, and then there is work for the
Hospital Corps.
The day after our last skirmish the burying
detail found seventy-eight dead Filipinos In
one sr>ot. The firing line was over a mile
long and the dead and wounded were lying
along the entire length.
Just before we got Into this fight we came
upon 1 sad spectacle. One of our battery boys
had been captured that morning and they had
murdered him by the side of the road. His
body was horribly mutilated.
One's feelings under fire are curious. Fear
passes away, except a dread that one may be
driven back. One looks at others and admires
them, and thinks that everybody ls brave but
himself. You wonder why a man standing be
side you remains there; you think he le foolish
und probably tell him to get down.
The celebrated Tennesseeans were with us
for a while. The boys tell great stories about
them. ' They started back for Manila with 200
prisoners. When they reached the city they
had 200 chickens instead, but none of the pris
oners had escaped. They sang "Marching
Through Georgia" and other" patriotic airs as
they marched along, and we gave it back to
them with "Dixie." â¢ * *
Burnett does not complain much, but
he -presses himself in the language of
another, "War is hell," and hopes he will
be back at Stanford next fall to play, foot
ball. He is a young giant, weighing 200
pounds, and has a magnificent ' pair of
shoulders. He is no doubt the pride of
his company as he doubt the football

TELLS OF THE SLAUGHTER
WHEELING, W. Va.. March 31.â
Lieutenant William Braunersreuther,
executive officer of the Charleston,
whose exploit in making the bloodless
capture of the Ladrone Islands last
summer was told by himself in the
Associated Press dispatches, writes'- an
interesting* letter from Manila to' Hon.
Augustus Pollock of this city. "He is
now captain of the port of Manila and
has under him some 500 native Fili
pinos, whom he- finds easy to control.
Speaking of the natives, he said:
The native himself, left to his own in
tentions, will never pro_e troublesome.
They will be only too willing to earn a
meager living and get a few dollars. They
are not hard to handle at all. Heretofore,
when fightinc With Spaniards, the rebels
have been badly organized and much
worse armed. Since that time they have
been better drilled, better armed and bet
ter organized, and they naturally con
cluded they could succeed In exterminat
ing the Americans. They. tried it two
weeks ago yesterday at 9 p. m. Thou
sands of them arc dead (cremated and
buried) and the hospitals are tilled with
their wounded, many of whom will never
recover.
, They have lost in and about here over
10,000 men. Our loss has been less than
100: to be exact, 88 officers and men-killed
and 275 wounded. Our wounded people
have a r mtÂ»ch hotter chance to recover
than theirs for this reason: the Mauser
hall makes a cleaner and smaller, wound
than do our Remingtons and Spring-fields
On the night of the 4th inst., when the
rebels were firing, quite a number, of
American ladies were at the Hotel Orlen
tes. I sent up for them and placed, them
on a transport in the hay. My * two girls
refused to go and stayed through It all.

Hood's Sarsaparilla is prepared, to- â¢
day under the careful personal supervis-
ion of those who originated it. Every in-
gredient Is the best of its kind. All the
roots and herbs used in it are gathered
at the seasons of their greatest medicinal .
value and are ground in our own Labora-
tory. Buying in enormous quantities we

kets of the world. Hood's Sarsaparilla
is a modern medicine whose combination,
proportion and process are peculiar to it-
self, producing a remedy unapproached
by any other blood -medicine, -J as clearly
proven by cures effected,. often when oth-
ers have totally failed, and by its enor-
mous sales far exceeding any and all sim-
ilar preparations, all claims to the con-
trary notwithstanding..

ALGER COMPELLED
EAGAN TO CONTRACT
FOR "PROCESSED" BEEF
WASHINGTON; March 31.â A1l but two
witnesses before the Army Beef
Inquiry* Court to-day were members of
the medical staff who were, on service ln
Cuba during the Spanish war. The other
two witnesses were George H. Giddings
and General J. Hale Sypher, who had
been interested in securing contracts for
Supplying beef on the hoof and on the
block for the army in Cuba, They testi
fied that General Eagan had told them
that the Secretary of War had asked him
to give the refrigerator beef a trial, while
Mr. Sypher said that General Eagan had
created the Impression upon him that he
preferred beef on the block to refrigerator
beef. Their testimony throughout was
contradictory to General Eagan's testi
mony.. Mr. Giddings said that Congress
man Hawley was present at several of
his conferences with General Eagan.
A majority of the army surgeons ex
pressed he opinion that the canned beef
was i* ._t!sfactory as food for the troops,
but some of them thought it no more
harmful than other meat in the Cuban
climate. ;â¢:,;:'.
Captain Ashton H. Beyl, chief surgeon of the
Rough Riders Brigade In the Santiago cam
paign, testified to being, made violently sick
on three different occasions by eating canned
roast beef and on one occasion several others
who partook of the meat with him also became
very 111. Soon- after | this â  experience he had
found a piece of bacon lying by the roadside.
This he had taken up, cleaned and cooked and
hail found It -very palatable. This meat had
not caused any inconvenience. The beef had
occasioned vomiting on each occasion. The
surgeon of the Tenth Cavalry had reported
similar experiences among the men of that
regiment as a result of eating the canned beef.
Others had eaten It without apparent 111 effect.
The beef was tough, stringy, tasteless and de
void of nutrition, and Dr. Heyl thought its use
had promoted disease In the army.
George H. Giddings of San Antonio, Texas,
who had put In a bid to supply the beef for
Cuba on the hoof, testified. In reply to a re
quest from Major Lee, Mr. Giddings detailed
the* particulars of various Interviews With Gen
eral . Eagan concerning the letting of the con
tract for beef. His first conversation had re
lated to the specifications for bids at which
Mr. Giddings had called attention to the fact
thai they were vague. General Eagan had then
said that the specifications were necessarily
vague, as he could not at that time give any
specific information. General Eagan had at
that time said his preference would be for re
frigerator beef, if he had any confidence ln it;
but he did not* think the refrigerator beef
could be made available in the Cuban climate.
"I had been In Cuba about this time my
self," said the witness, "and I agreed with
him that it would be Impossible to keep the
refrigerator beef ln that climate without re
frigerators."
Mr. Giddings then told of his visit to the
commissary general on the. Ist of July, when
the latter told him that the Secretary of War
had sent for him the night before and had
said that owing to the difference In price they
had better give the refrigerator beef a trial
and that he would have to do this.
"I then asked General Eugan if he had any
confidence ln the proposition and he replied
that he had very little, but that the refrigera
tor men were prepared to give bonds to keep
the beef good for seventy-two hours after
leaving the refrigerators- He also stated that

they had a preserving process by which they
were able to keep the beef in condition, but
he said that if there was dissatisfaction after
the contract went Into effect he would upset
It and give the Texas cattlemen a chance.
Mr. Giddings then proposed to make a propo
sition .to keep his combination of cattlemen
together for the purpose of taking .the â  con
tract in the emergency indicated, and this he
did. He produced a copy of this document.
He had represented, he said, the combination
was fully capable of carrying the contract into
effect.
Mr. Giddings said In reply to questions by
Major Lee that General Eagan had told him
that; when he was an Officer ln the field he
always drove his beef with him on foot and
that he (Eagan) thought this the proper way
to supply beef for the army.
* Repeating his Interview with Secretary Alger
General Eagan had said, according to â  Mr.
t'iddings: "Well, the Secretary sent for me
last night and. told me that there was so much
difference in price that we should give the
refrigerator beef a trial."
*' 'Did he order you to do that?" I asked."
" 'Xo,' he replied, 'but his wish amounts to
an order.' General Eagan then repeated his
want of . confidence and reiterated that if the
beef did not prove satisfactory he would annul
the contract, for he would not let the soldiers
be poisoned." EBB POtSWCTSSI
With reference to General Eagan's reference
to a preservative process, Mr. Giddings said
that the genera" had told him that Swift & Co.,
who had made the. lowest bid on refrigerator
beef, had a process which would enable them
to keep the beef for seventy-two hours after
being taken from th refrigerator..
" 'Do you believe it?' l asked General Eagan,"
said Mr. Giddings, "to which he replied. 'I've
got to believeâ got to give it a trial.' "
Mr. Giddings said his relations had .been
pleasant with General Eagan, that he had gone
into the general's office frequently, because he
felt that he had a right to do so.

"If," he added, "General Eagan referred to
me when he said he had forbidden some one
admission to his office, the statement was un
true."
.1. Hall Sypher, attorney for the Texas cattle
men, confirmed what Mr. Giddings had said.
He said that while he had not visited General
Eagan with Mr. Giddings, be had seen him
frequently and talked fully with him on this
subject in the interest of the Texas men.
"General Eagan," said the witness, "con
veyed the Impression to me that he distinctly
and positively preferred beef on the block to
refrigerator beef, and I so Informed my peo
ple, sending for some of them to come here."
Sypher said that he had first discovered a
tendency to change his mind on the part of
General Eagan soon after the bids were opened.
"He disclosed to me then," said the witness,
"that the refrigerator beef men had volunteered
to give a bond for the preservation â¢of their
meat for seventy-two hours after leaving t*he
refrigerator. I asked him if he thought *it
possible to do this, and he replied: 'I don't
believe it unless they put up cold storage
plants.' " ' : =
Continuing. Sypher said that something was
said by . General Eagan at this juncture con
cerning a preservative process, but that he gave
it very little attention.
"Some days later," Sypher said, -'General
Eagan informed me that owing to the great
difference in price, he would have to give the
refrigerator beef a trial. 'Trial' was the word
he used."
The witness said In reply to a question put
by Major Le*i that General Eagan had said
something about "political pressure" as the
reason for the necessity for making the trial,
and that he had said something about his con
ference with the Secretary of War. As to Just
what he had said on this latter point witness
could not remember, but he thought Mr. Gid
dings had stated it correctly.
Major Philip F. Harvey, who was chief sur
geon of the first division of the army at San
tiago, and Major A. H. Appel. who was in
command of one of the division hospitals, both
testified, but neither had given especial atten
tion to the beef used.
Major Appel said he had never heard a good
word said for the canned beef..

inspector of the army, who was the chief sur

tified that while In Cuba on his way to Porto
Rico he had been able to give no attention to
the food supplies of the troops, but while In
Porto Rico he had looked Into the question of
food Incidentally. He then .heard no com
plaints of Importance except as to the charac
ter of the cooking. His attention had not heen
brought to any complaints concerning either the
canned or refrigerator beef. He had eaten
some of the canned roast beef and did not
relish it.
, . "It was not pleasing to the sight," he said,
"and It was mawkish to the taste without con
diments such as salt and pepper."
In reply to a question as to what effect the
use of this meat as food would have upon the I
health of the troops. Dr. Greenleaf said the ef
fect of it would be similar to the use of all
canned meat. If good and prepared with con
diments and vegetables, and not used too
much. It might be used without detriment. If
spoiled. It would produce sickness, or probably. j
if used steadily, the system .would not accept :
it. It would, if used dally and without condi- {
ment- or vegetables, pall on the appetite,
which would at last revolt against It.
He had found that ln the hot climate of \
Porto Rico the meat . did not keep long . when
opened. He had not taken the food question* I
into account ln connection with the health of j
the troops, attributing the sickness solely to
the climate.

PLATFORM OF
PORTO RICANS
Carefully Prepared by
the New Party.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
SAN JUAN. Porto Rico, March 22.â
'A; new political party has been born,
"the Republican party of Porto Rico."
Though the party waa organized by
the radicals under the leadership of
IVlanuel Rossey, it has for its object the
â association of all political elements â .-**
this island, and they have agree! upon
a platform which is pronounced to be
.faultless in its Americanism. Th. plat
lorn, in part is as follows:
That is tho highest duty of every citi
zen to uphold the integrity of the country
and the laws of the land. That we
iplcdgo ourselves as men, animated by a
common cause, aiming at a common ob
ject, to do all in our power for our Gov
tniment. We indorse and commend the
â able, patriotic and true American spirit
manifested by Hon. William McKinley,
President of the United States, in releas
ing us from the misrule of Spain, and we
pledge our faithfulness to adhere to the
new principles of our new country and
have tor our aim harmony, unity and
i*ood government relying with confidence
upon the. hope or a speedy settlement of
our national affairs. /
, The name of our -party shall be "The
Republican Party of Porto Rico."
We declare our sincere loyalty to the
American flag and American Ideas, and
liorebv pledge ourselves to strive to be
come worthy of the great nation of which
we are now a part. M***M
We hail with pride- our annexation to
the United States.
We believe the people of Porto Rico
could bo trusted with the civil govern
ment of the island, but as that authority
only emanates from tho Congres*? of the
United States it is but our duty to await
their action, and while under military
government awaiting actloneby Congress
we desire that all civil offices should be
filled by men capable, honest and of un
questionable loyalty to the Government
of the United States and disposed to act
singly lor the best Interest of this island
end our common country without distinc
tion, thereby affording us an opportunity
to "emonstrate our fitness for self-gov
ernment, with all the burdens and re
sponsibilities which it entails, and which
will hasten the day when our island will
.have a place among the States of our
Union.
Succeeding planks declare in favor of
a universal suffrage; oppose the intro
duction into the island of foreign labor;
express devotion to liberty of thought,
conscience and speech, including the
freedom of the press, and deprecate any
"union of church and state. Free
fechools and the teaching of English are
demanded. A change in the present
system of taxation and free trade be
tween Porto Rico and the United
(states are advocated. The exchange of
the provincial money for money of the
'nit- States Is advocated on a. gold
"ba.is; "as it Is right and proper that
very dollar, paper or coin, issued by the
Government be as good as any other."
The establishment of an American sys
tem of courts is favored. The platform
concludes tin's:
We congratulate ourselves and our
(country on being under the pi Hectlon of
the American flag, the recognized emblem
â of liberty, and will lend every effort to
â advance civilization, to teach loyalty, to
love American Institutions and honor
Washington. Lincoln and McKinley,
â¢whose names are household words in the
land.
Tt is. said by the organizers of this
party that the name . "Republican" is
used in its general sense, and has no
relation to the party of that name in
the United States.
It is understood that General Henry
ls in entire accord with the establish
ment of the new American party.

BUDDHIST PRIESTS
BECOME BANDITS
Terrorizing a Section of
Manchuria.
Special _M_ratch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 31.â 1t is reported
from Newchwang, Manchuria, that a
bold robber , chief has suddenly sprung
into prominence In that section. He Is
a no less personage than a ferocious
Llama or Buddhist priest, who formerly
practically ruled the fierce; tribe of Man
churians living in the mountains in the
Interior of Manchuria. Finding that the
practice of his profession as a priest did
not bring him much worldly, goods , this
llama gradually turned bandit and has
now surrounded himself with a band of
hardened desperadoes, which is said .to
consist principally of former Buddhist
priests. These priests have been through
the same experiences as their chieftain,
coming finally to the conclusion that a
career of* pillage and crime is more remu
nerative than the conversion of Man
churlans to the Buddhist religion.
The correspondent of the North China
Dally News writes to Shanghai that
troops have been sent against these priest
marauders, but have so far accomplished
nothing. The bandits are mounted on
hardy and fleet ponies and are well,
I equipped with Winchesters and other
I modern weapons. They have defied pur
suit. They have the advantage of know
ing the roads in every direction, as well
- as many mountain fastnesses, where they
; can take refuge when closely pursued.
In the neighborhood of their former
; homes they commit no depredations, but
keep on good terms with the Inhabitants
:as a -matter of self-protection. Outside
! of this district they burn and pillage at
I will, in some instances adding murder to
: their misdeeds. Such Is the terror ln
which this Buddhist chieftain is regarded
|by the villagers between Newchwang
I and Llao Yung that mothers quiet their
i refractory children by telling them* that
I "the Llama robber is coming."
SANTA CLARA'S ORATOR
WINS THE DEBATE
Albert de Witt Carries Oft the Honors
in an Interscholastic Contest
at San Jose.
SAN JOSE. March 31.â Parents and
friends of the pupils of the Santa Clara
and San Jose high schools and the State
Normal School filled Normal Hall to
night to listen to the lnterscholastlc debate
of the schools. Fully 1000 persons were pres
ent. County Superintendent L. J. Chip
man presided. Three schools had chosen
orators. Santa Clara High School was
represented by H. Albert de- Witt, San
Jose High School by Edward Black and
the Normal School by William Donlon.
San Jose High School withdrew, how
ever, greatly disappointing the people.
A fine musical and literary programme
was rendered. The three schools attend
ed in a body. The greatest enthusiasm
prevailed, and the class yells were al
most deafening. The judges were Pro
fessors Pease, Davidson and Fairclough
of Stanford. Wl |l-l_l__ff**i
Albert de Witt of Santa Clara was de
clared the winner. His oration was an
original one, the subject being "Against
Expansion of Territory." His delivery
and pronunciation were excellent, and he.
clearly outclassed his opponent. Don
lon's oration was affirmative of the same
subject.
Graduation exercises were hold at the
State Normal School this morning, and
thirteen young teachers were given di
plomas. The graduates were: Walter G.

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL I, 1899.
POWERS NOW AGREE
CONCERNING SAMOA
BERLIN, April I.â The com
ment on the Samoan question
continues fairly moderate,
though the papers naturally de
fend the German officials , and
throw all the blame on the
Americans and the English. The
Kolnfsche Zeitung says:
"The chief share of the respon
sibility ought to be laid at Eng
land's door, since she allowed
her naval officers to act at their
discretion, thus showing that she
values the friendship of Cousin
Jonathan very highly and al
ways "joins with him when it is
a question of having a fling at
Germany."
The Kreuz Zeitung reminds
Great Britain and the United
States that Germany is not
Spain, and that German patience
has its limits. It adds: v "There
are ' conceivable national com
binations besides the Anglo-
German entente."
WASHINGTON, March 31.â A
joint high commission to set
tle the entire Samoan trouble
has been practically agreed
upon by the. United States, British and
German Governments. Lord Salisbury's
absence from London alone delays the
formal acceptance by Great '*' Britain,
"though in his absence sir. Thomas San
derson and Mr. Villiers, who are under
stood to be specially familiar with the
Samoan question, have approved' the
plan for a commission. The United
States has informally expressed its ap
proval, and the formal acceptance, it is
learned from the best quarter, will fol
low speedily.
As the proposition originates with
Germany her approval, of course, is as
sured. This high commission, it is felt,
affords a pacific solution to the whole
trouble at the moment when Samoan
affairs began to look the most threaten
ing. The new plan has been fully gone
over by Secretary Hay and the British
and German Embassadors here and its
essential details worked out. Each, na
tion is to be represented by one mem
ber of the commission. It is to have
practically unlimited authority wit. 'out
the necessity of referring its decisions
back to the several governments for ap
proval.
It is felt that by conferring such
complete and final authority on the
High Commission the danger will be
obviated of any further deadlocks and
delays. Still another important pro
vision under consideration is that King
Oscar of Norway and Sweden shall be
the umpire in case the three High Com
missioners should fail to reach a deter
mination. The plan of inviting King
Oscar to referee a disagreement meets
the approval of the British and German
authorities and doubtless will be ap
proved also by the United States as a
means of ensuring finality of decision,
though it is not known just how far
this has been considered by the Wash-'
ington authorities. â ! . " *
â¢ King Oscar was agreed, upon between
the United States and Great Britain as
a final arbitrator in connection with the
proposed Anglo-American arbitration
treaty, .as well as in the Venezuelan
matter. " He is also mentioned in the
treaty of Berlin as the one to name a
Chief Justice of Samoa in case the
three signatory powers . fail to agree
on a Chief Justice. It was this that led
to the suggestion of his name at pres
ent time to act as final arbitrator. The
expectation is that the sittings of the
commission will be in Samoa, where for
the time being they will have complete
authority over the whole range of Sa
moan affairs, so far as the High Com
mission think fit to act in order to
fully restore and establish affairs on a
stable basis. It will require no treaty
to bring the commission into exist
ence, as the acceptances of the United
States and Great Britain will complete
the agreement.
It Is understood that the men selected
for the mission will be of high standing
so as to give added weight and dignity
to their findings, such, for, instance, as
the Consul General of Germany, whose
jurisdiction covers the. whole range. of
Pacific affairs. He is a man of complete

By this it is not meant that he is

been the subject of .comment for some
days. that affairs in the War Depart
ment under the management of Assist
ant Secretary' Meiklejohn have been

of steamers between Apia and Sydney
(thirteen days), if Rear Admiral Kautz
had forwarded a* telegram on the 18th
via Sydney the dispatch would not
have arrived at Sydney until to

ALTGELD NOW
HAS THE SWINE
His Faction Is Duly
Recognized.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 31.â The Demo
cratic National Committee to-day offi
cially recognized the Altgeld faction in
the mayoralty campaign as the regu
lar Democratic organization. The pre_s
bureau of the committee, which issues
a weekly bulletin to Democratic news
papers of the country, in the issue for
this week has an article on the "Chi
cago situation," which asserts that the
late Democratic city convention was
Democratic in name only. The article
declares the convention failed to an
nounce "allegiance to the Chicago plat
form, and that all real Democrats of
Chicago are supporting John P. Alt
geld. It then proceeds to flay Mayor
Harrison's administration in detail.
Eight hundred Democratic papers
take the press bureau service. Each
week it sends out such literature as has
received the approval of the National
Committee.
Governor Altgeld's managers to-day
received proofs of the matter sent out
for the issue of April 1. Later in the
day they issued the following:
What Democrats throughout the coun
try think of the merits of the controversy
between Altgeld and Harrison Is correctly
stated in the Democratic press bulletin, is
sued from the press bureau of the Demo
cratic National Committee. The bulletin
Is printed every Saturday in the interest
of Democratic papers all over the coun
try. What it says of the Chicago situa
tion may be taken as official. Under the
caption of "The Chicago Situation," in its
Issue of April 1, it says "Harrison Demo
crats of Chicago, in convention assembled,
failed to announce allegiance to the na
tional platform of 1896. This, for the rea
son that they owe no allegiance to it. To
tell the truth, there were no real Demo
crats In the convention. It was Demo
cratic in name only."
All the* real Democrats of Chicago are
supporting John P. Altgeld, who is run
ning on the national platform, and, al
though elected as a Democrat. Harrison
has never done anything while in office to
entitle him to the honor of being called
a Democrat. He no sooner got into the
mayoralty than he placed himself under
the protection of Mark Hanna's Chicago
agents. Editors Kohlsaat and Lawson,
and, as a result, the doors of the City
Hall have for two years been closed to
real Democrats..
The city of Chicago has been badly gov
erned in other ways. A man without any
strength himself, and with no vestige ot
principle, Harrison, In the adminis
tration of affairs, with but one or two
notable exceptions, surrounded himself
with a lot of low-down ward politicians,
including ex-conVlcts. who have been
plundering the city right and left. It is
stated that at least a million of the peo
ple's money has found its way Into the
pockets of Harrison's henchmen.
Governor Altgeld declined to talk
about the statement, saying it spoke
for itself. -
W. H. ("Coin") Harvey said it was
a remarkable statement.
. "This seems to come very close to
Chairman Jones," he said. "I have no
doubt it expresses Mr. Jones' senti
ments."
Among politicians the manifesto was
regarded as fixing the stamp of irreg
ularity on the Altgeld organization. It
places Governor. Altgeld's party in po
sition to be recognized as the regular
Democratic organization by the next
Democratic National Convention, and
Democrats who want to get into the
convention from Illinois will have to be
with the ex-Governor. '
CHIEF MOSES CALLED
BEFORE THE MANITOU
Sachem of the Colville Reservation
Indians Enters the Happy
Hunting Grounds.
SEATTLE, March News was re
ceived this evening from Eastern Wash
ington of the death of Chief Moses, one'
of' the oldest and best known Indians of
the "Pacific Northwest. He was head
chief of all the Indians in the Colville
reservation, .about 2000, Including his
band of Columbias, the Okanogans,
Lakes, Colvllles, Nes Pelims and San
Polls. He lived near the *Nes Pelim
sub-agency, ' about three miles from Jo
seph's place. He was quite well off in
land, and stock, and for several years
has been drawing an anuity of ?1000
"from the Government.
' Moses was 75 or 80 years of age. lie
came of fighting stock. His father was
killed in an Indian war in Montana, and
be was on the warpath in that State and
was repatedly wounded in battle. Later
he was in the Indian battles on the Co
lumbia River, west of Spokane.
â¢ Moses remained at peace, though, dur
ing the Nes Perce war. He was urged
by Joseph to join forces with him. but
refused. He has since said that he wa
" vered, but finally decided to remain at
peace with the whites.
Moses was a large man, and when in
health weighed 240 pounds. -He had a
remarkably well-shaped head. He had
one daughter. His only, son was drowned
a few years ago in the rapids of the Co
lumbia", near Spokane.

STARVATION FOR
SECTION MEN
Southern. Pacific Makes
a .Big Reduction.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, March 31.â The Southern
Pacific Company has trouble on its hands
on the mountain division of the Shasta
route. An order goes into effect to-mor
row materially reducing the wages of all
the section gangs. It is not a direct cut
at the wage scale, but a reduction in
hours, with a corresponding effect in
wages. Section men have heretofore re
ceived 16 cents an hour for ten hours'
work. Under the new scale the men will
be given but eight hours a day and Aye
days a week. The men all declare they
will not submit to the reduction. It is not
expected their action will constitute what
may be called a strike, but they will re
fuse to work and seek other employment.
The company will have no little difficulty
in filling the vacant places with reliable
white laborers, and it is possible that Chi
nese may again make their appearance in
the section gangs on the Shasta route.
The policy pursued by the company for
over a year past has been one of tha
strictest economy* possible. Track walk
ers were supplanted by "speeders." who
could cover the "beats" of several foot
men, and section gangs were cut out or
consolidated. It is a singular coincidence
that soon after this era of parsimony was
ushered in wreck after wreck occurred
on the Shasta route and each from the
same causeâ spreading of the rails. Rot
ten crossties were taken out, turned over
and made to do another era of duty.
Railroad crews handling the heavy
freight trains attributed the wrecks by
which their comrades were killed or
maimed to the cutting down of track re
pairing crews and track walkers and the
use of' worn out crossties, which should
have been replaced with new material.
It Is hot expected that the men who
have announced their intention to quit
will create any disturbance or interfere
with any laborers, white or Chinese, who
may take their places. They say they will
relinquish their jobs simply because they
cannot work and live for $128 a day for
five days a week. The sympathy of the
public all along the line is with the men,
some of whom have families to support.
VOLUNTEERS RETAINED
IN THE PHILIPPINES
, WASHINGTON, March 31.â 1t was
stated at the War Department to-day
that the provision of the army law al
lowing the retention in service for .six
months of the volunteers in the Philip
pines has been construed to mean the
officers as well as the men, and that the
volunteer organizations would be re-
tamed jusjt as they now exist. General
Otis was given large plenary pow
ers in the matter, but was in
structed by cable to send all sick and
wounded home, as well as volunteers
who had exceptional reasons why they
should return home, such as the sup
port of families and the loss of prop
erty by reason of their absence. Gen
eral Otis will decide such questions on
their merits. The volunteers in the
Philippines will not be mustered out
until they can be spared, and the pres
ence there of these organizations, the
War Department believes, makes it un
necessary to organize the provisional
army of 35,000 allowed under the army
law.

alarm box and rang in an alarm, which
sounded as Clerk Sanders commenced
his investigation. .
By the time the fire department ar
rived the whole building was doomed,
so great was the headway of the flames.
The fire first swept up the back end of
the building and licked its way to the
many departments* Smoke was pour
ing" densely from every window and
soon leaped high above the structure.
One alarm after another was rung
in. Traffic on Mission and Market
streets was suspended by "cars and the
thousands of people hurrying- to the
scene of the conflagration. Fire lines
â¢were hastily strung, but as the fire in
creased in volume the police were
forced to draw their clubs and drive the
curious mob of spectators back to en
able the firemen to work. In Fremont
stre-t for the first half hour disorder
reigned supreme. Above the roar of the
blaze could be heard the voices of fire
men shouting unintelligible orders.
Ladders were hastily run up the sides
of the building and as hurriedly with
drawn, owing to the intense heat and
dense smoke.
finally the water tower was backed
up in front of the structure and
tons of water were poured into the
building. The fight of the elements
had commenced in earnest. At about
the name time lines of hose were at
tached to the standpipes on the Sacra
mento building and the fire was thus
fought from the rear. A half dozen
streams were poured but ln the face
of the vast wall of flame they appeared
useless. Wherever a stream struck
there would be an. almost indistinguish
able hissing noise, a few sparks would
fly up and that was all. When the
flames were finally under control-; the
building was a complete wreck. To
day, after all Is over, there are four
charred and blackened walls standing
and an immense mass of destroyed
stock.
During the progress of the fire, Jo
seph Sloss, a member of the firm, re
mained in Mack ' & Co.'s drug
house, which is immediately opposite.
While there he was Joined by Mr.
Scott, another member of the firm. The
employes reported to him what they
knew of the fire's origin. . Mr. Sloss
was unwilling to make an estimate of
the amount of stock carried by the firm
or the amount of insurance on it, but
it is said that the stock is worth in the,
neighborhood of - $400,000, and that it
. va* Insured for nearly, two â¢ hundred
_5-&\Sf__f_S__
and fifty thousand dollars. The heavy
insurance on the stock was placed by
Loaiza & Co. and J. Greenebaum. Near
ly every big Insurance concern in this
city carried a portion of the insurance
on their books, including the Western,
Fireman's Fund, Phoenix of London,
Connecticut and British American.
Miller, Sloss & Scott occupied the five
stories of the large brick building at 18
--22 Fremont street. The firm succeeded
Huntington, Hopkins & Co. and was in
corporated with the following officers:
Charles E. Miller, president; A. W. Mll
llgan, first vice president; A. L. Scott,
second vice president; Joseph Sloss, sec
retary and treasurer. The directors are:
C. E. Miller, A. L. Scott (a nephew of
Irving M. Scott), A. W. Milllgan, Leon
Sloss, Joseph Sloss and William Arm
strong. The firm employed 128 people.
It did a general wholesale business in
hardware, iron, steel and pipe. The
building it occupied is owned by W. S.
Foy, formerly of Huntington, Hopkins
& Co. It has occupied its present quar
ters nearly five years.
It. is said the structure was inade
quate to hold the firm's Increasing busi
ness and about two weeks ago the cor
poration paid $100,000 for a valuable
piece of property now occupied by the
Mechanics' Mill at the southwest cor
ner of Mission and Fremont streets, arid
the firm. intended erecting a large build
ing there in the near future.
A. D. Coddington. the shipping clerk,
was in the immediate vicinity when
the fire was discovered. He rushed to
the store and arrived there the moment
the Underwriters' Patrol men entered
the burning building. He told the fire
men where to lay their covers, and did
other things with a view to saving his
employers' property. Later he reported
what he had done to Joseph Sloss. The
latter anxiously asked him whether he
had locked the safe door, and he re
plied that in his exictement he did not
notice whether the door was secured.
Mr. Sloss visibly showed that he was
worried, as he knew if the contents of
the safe was destroyed the loss of his
firm would be greater than ever, as the
books, insurance policies and other
valuables reposed in it. Coddington
pluckily volunteered to enter the flam
ing building to see if the . safe was
locked, and attempted to do so, but was
drenched for his pains. A few minutes
later he again essayed to reach' the
oflice where the safe was. but accord
ing to his statement Fire Marshal
Towe, who accompanied him, was
afflicted with "cold feet," and demurred
to going any further. Greatly to Mr.
Sloss' relief he later learned that the
safe door was secured.
At the time of the fire Mr. Miller was
in Belvedere and although notified of
his loss was unable to reach the scene.
Mr. Scott was more fortunate. He
caught the first boat and reached the
spot in time to hear the crackle of cart
ridges that were exploding on the sec
ond floor. â¢ â  *
But for the fact that the building oc
cupied by Miller, Sloss & Scott was con
structed of brick and steel, the build
ings adjoining it would have been de
stroyed. Its heavy fire walls prevented
a spread of the flames and the only
damage done the manufactories close
by was through smoke and water.- The
Boston Woven Hose and Rubber Com
pany's basement was partly flooded. by
water, damaging the large amount of
goods stored there. The Crane Com
pany, which occupied a section of the'
Fay building, was filled with smoke
and drenched with water, but as it car
ries plumbing materials and other inde
structible stock, their damage will not
be serious.
Chief Sullivan and his men reached
the fire soon after the flrst alarm was
sounded. The magnitude of the con
flagration and the dangerous neighbor
hood decided the" Chief to tap two more
alarms. The flre was fought from all
sides. On Fremont .street the water
tower and, its powerful battery did
splendid service. Tons of water were
thrpwn into the building from adjoining
roofs and from the back, but the blaze
was not subdued until three hours
later. ; The building and its contents
were nearly totally destroyed during
that short period, the loss being ap
proximated at $300,000, including the
loss of $100,000 on the building, covered
by insurance. Thousands' upon thou
sands of wooden handles and boxes bf
portions of farming implements were
on the floor where the flre started. This
was made highly inflammable by rea
son of the fact that they had been put
through a course of varnishing.
The other floors were stocked with
the finest cutlery, revolvers', shotguns,
hardware of every description, wire
netting, parts of machinery, etc. Their
contents were either destroyed by the
flames or irreparably damaged .by
water.vaÃjES
It will be some days before the ex
act extent of the loss can be ascer
tained, but a general idea can be had
when it is remembered that the great
est hardware establishment â¢on ' the
coast has been destroyed,, and this is
a city of big establishments.
A DESERTED CHILD.
By cable from London comes the news
of a child deserted by its almost royal
relatives and in danger of going to the
workhouse for the lack of support. The
story is told by Miss M. Canning, super
intendent of the Ings House Hospital in
London. Miss Canning says that three
years ago the Baroness de Buren, al
leged to be a relative by marriage of the
late Empress of Austria, came to the
hospital* with a girl not over 16 years of
age, who, the Baroness said, was her
sister. She wanted the girl 'cared for and
the young woman became an inmate of
the hospital for three months, during
which lime a baby girl was born to her.
This child was left in charge of Miss
Canning, who says she was told to take
it to a foundling .asylum, or do whatever
she pleased with it. - She kept it, she
says, until now she is in destitute cir
cumstances and she wishes- the child's
relatives to care for It. or it will have
to become a public charge.
The Baronness de Buren was Daisy
Newman, at one time well known In
this city. Her mother and sisters, who
were" in England .three years ago, are
now living here, and on them has fallen
the scandal caused by the statements
made by Miss Canning. Mrs. Newman
denies the story from beginning to end.
She says .her daughter, the Baroness,
did bring a young girl, pot her sister,
in whom she took an interest, to the
hospital, and that the glrj became the
mother of a child. This child, she says,
was adopted legally and with the consent
of all parties concerned, by Miss '.in
ning. She* said the Baroness was fre
quently applied to for money to assist
In the support of the child, but that
lately the Baroness has not responded
to these demands, and Mrs. Newman
thinks the publication of the scandalous
story is the result.
The record of the child's birth tells an
other tale. It shows that on February
15,1896, a baby girl was born in the Ings
House Hospital. Under the space for
the name and surname of the father is a
blank; under the space for his rank and
profession is a blank. He Is a certain
well-known young man of this city. The
address of the mother is given as a num
ber on Southwlck street, Hyde Park,
London; she is described as being of in
dependent meansâ and her name is also
given. _
CHINESE DENS BAIDED.
The police mad a their first move in the
battle against the Chinese gambling dens
which flourish under the name of "clubs"
last night. At 11:30 o'clock Lieutenant
E-SOla and Sergeant Christ n. with
four men, started out from the California
street police station to make a general
round-up.
They first attacked the "Chinese Mer
chants' Exchange", and the "United Ori
ental Social Club," on the. corners of
Washington' street and Waverly* place.
Th- door of the Merchants* Exchange
yielded under* a' few .'.blows, and twenty
six Chinese, a complete, fan-tan layout
and about ."4000 In coin were gathered in.
At the social club the door was so strong!
ly constructed that the police were unable
to break i' open. Half of it was glass
guarded with brass bars. , The bar were
torn away, the. glass .'shattered and the
officers climbed in through the upper half
of the door. A*far.-tan layout, a horde tit
chattering Chinese and a quantity of < pin
were also captuied in this )/..-]' c. The men
were all taken to .the California street
police station and bosked.- '
THE SAN rK ANCISCO CALL, SATTJBDAY, APBIL 1, 1899.
STEAMER CRASHES
ON CASQUET ROCKS
AND MANY PERISH
OUTHAMPTON,
March 31.â Th- pas
senger steamer Stel
la, plying between
this port and . the
Channel Islands,
crashed upon the
dreaded Casquet
Rocks, near the isl
and of Alderney,
yesterday afternoon
in a dense fog and
foundered in ten
minutes, her. boilers
exploding with a tremendous report
as she went down. In spite of this, it
is said there was no panic on board.
The coasting steamer Lynx, which
brought the news of the disaster- here.
picked Up four boats and forty persons.
It is estimated that 120 persons were
drowned.
. The second officer of the steamer.; who
was among those rescued, says. that a
collapsible boat . was launched full of
people, but he thinks she struck on the
rocks, owing to the fog.
Another steamer has picked up a boat,
containing forty-five' persons, including
twenty women, who escaped from the
wrecked steamer. They have been,
landed here.
The Stella had on board 210 passen
gers, who were going to spend Easter
in the Channel Islands. . , "
The Stella, which belonged .to the
London and Southwestern Railway
Company, left Southampton* at noon
yesterday, conveying the â  first excur
sion of the season to the Channel Isl
ands. There were about 185 passengers
on board" and the crew numbered
thirty-five men. The weather -was
foggy, but. all went well until the aft
ernoon, when the fog- became most
dense. At* 4 o'clock the Casquet Rocks
suddenly loomed through the fog bank,
and the steamer almost immediately
afterward struck amidships. The cap
tain-, seeing that the steamer, was fast
sinking, ordered the lifeboats to be"
launched. His instructions were car
ried out with the utmost celerity, and
the women and children were embarked
in the boats. Then the captain ordered |
the men to .look after themselves. .
A survivor states that fie and
twenty-five others put off- from the j
Stella in a small boat. The sea was
calm, but there was a big swirl around
the rocks. When this boat was a short j
distance away from . the wreck the I
boilers of the Stella burst with a ter- j
rific explosion, and the vessel disap- i
peared stern foremost in the sea..
The last thing the survivor saw was
the figure of the capialn of the Stella j
standing calmly on the bridge and giv- j
ing his last instructions/. He perished j
with his vessel, the suction caused by \
the sinking steamer being very great.
Continuing,- the* survivor referred to
said:
The suction was so tremendous that we :
thought our boat would be engulfed. I !
saw five boats and the collapsible boat
besides our own leave, the wreck! They
contained altogether between eighty and ;
one hundred persons. Five of the boats
were soon lost to view, but we took a I
boat filed with .women in tow, and the i
occupants of our boat' took the oars in
turn -and rowed all night long until most -
of us dropped to sleep, thoroughly ex- \
hausted.
We sighted a sailboat at 6 o'clock* in
the. morning, but the Great Western Rail
way Company's steamer Lynx, from !
Weymouth, had meanwhile hove in sight. *
She" bore down on us and took us all on j
board, eventually landing us at Guernsey. j
The Great Western Railway Com
pany's steamer Vera, from Southamp
ton, has picked up forty others of the
survivors and landed them â¢at Guern
sey. * ,';,â -.;â '. *.. -â *-.--": >
JURY BRIBERY
INTIMATED IN
LAWLOR'S COURT
Stormy Ending of a
Larceny Case.
A. W. Manning, A. ChrJstensen, J. H.
Moore, E. Engelberg. E. A. Cutting, Sam
uel Harris, .H. Messenberg, T. C. Van
Bibber, H. Kahn.. J. L. Markel. Â°J. H. â 
Paige and D. B. Francis are the twelve
men, "'good aid true," who will be called
upon in the near future? to explain the
system of reasoning used by them â¢in
reaching a verdict late yesterday after
noon while serving as a jury that gave
freedom to Frank H. Rood.. charged with
larceny* for having swindled Cornelius
Cronln of Nevada out of the sum of $180.
Rood had been on trial for many days
before Judge Lawlor and the jury named
on the charge of larceny. .
It was claimed by the prosecution that
Cronin. the complaining witness, had de
oosited $255 in defendant's saloon, on Va
lencia, and Sixteenth streets, but when he
called for It was given hut $7a and then
cast into the street. _,___,_.
During the many days of trial the pros
ecution established a strong case against
the defendant and his conviction, it .was.
thought, was assured. Thursday night,
however. James H. â¢ Moore, one of the
Jurors was heard to say that his mind
was made up; that he did not believe the
testimony of certain of the prosecution's
witnesses, and therefore must find the
defendant not guilty. This tangled mat
ters but the court kept- silent and await
ed the verdict. Early in the afternoon
the jury retired- to deliberate on a ver
dict, but the hours passed aud no return
was made. Finally the bell announced,
that instructions were wanted, and , the
jury filed into court. Desired instruc
tions were given and the jury returned to
its rooms - for further deliberation:
Finally, a, verdict was reached,* and the
twelve men, "good and true," again filed
into the jury box. in answer to the ques
tion of the clerk the. foreman arose and
said that the. verdict was "not guilty."
When it was found that Rood was a
free man. Judge Lowlor opened on the
jury.
"In discharging -the jury the "court feels
constrained -to; say that the verdict rep- .
resents: a miscarriage of .justice," said : â¢
Judge Lawlor. . "The court Is convinced
that a serious crime has been committed,
and that the perpetratorsâ at least one
of the perpetratorsâ has escaped justice,
I discharge the jury from further attend
ance on this case, with these remarks."
Her-*- the court addressed himself per
sonally to Moore and grilled him on his
conduct and expression of opinion on the*
case prior to submission.
"At the conclusion of the session, of
court yesterday afternoon, and while .the
Judge of this court was standing in the
neighborhood of the 'jury box," said the
court, "you undertook to .address him
and to intimate that it was the; duty. of
the court. to send the jury to get certain
evidence: and you did that before the
case had, been, submitted to you and be
fore you* were -authorized- to determlnie
any fact in the case. So as not to involve
the fortunes of. this defendant in the out
come of this trial the court refrained
from doing more than to tell you; at: the
time, to perform your duty and to decide
the- case according. to the evidence 'that
I
.'. The disaster caused intense excite
ment in the island of Guernsey, and
here. t There were harrowing scenes at
the offices of the London and "South
western Railway at both places. Many
families lost one ' or more relatives.
Husbands are inquiring for their wives
and wives are asking after their hus
bands; parents are seeking news of
lost children and children are making
inquiries for missing parents. All the
flags are half-masted.
Up to noon to-day 102 passengers had
been accounted for, including Mr. J.
Parton and his. wife. Mr. Parton is the
manager of the Western London office
of the American line. The steamers
Honfleur and Vera are cruising in the
vicinity of the wreck.
â  Later ; accounts say that the Stella
had 140 passengers on board and that
her crew numbered forty-two persons.
Another steamer of the same com
pany, which arrived at the island of
Jersey at abojft noon to-day, reports
having passed many bodies. of victims
of the ' disaster about the Casquet
rocks. â¢ -
A survivor of the disaster named
Bush says the. speed of the Stella In the
fog was not diminished, though the fog
whistles were sounded. Bush adds that
at 3:30 a. m. the engineer showed him in
the engine room a dial registering a
Speed of eighteen and a half knots. He
says the vessel struck within twenty
five,minutes afterward. Bush further
asserts that two lifeboats were sunk
with the steamer, which, after resting
on the rocks for ten or fifteen minutes,
split in two and disappeared.
Continuing, Bush said: - 'v;
When the Stella disappeared forty or
fifty persons were discovered, clinging
to pieces of wreckage or cabin furniture
and crying piteously for help. All the
passengers and crew had been provided
with life belts, and there was little panic
as the ship sank. I first slipped into the
water and then swam to one of the boats,
into which I "was helped. We rowed sup
posedly in the direction of Guernsey, but
seven hours later found ourselves near
the scene of the wreck and saw dozens
of persons, clinging to the rocks.
The boat in which Bush was a pas
senger, was afterward picked up by the
Lynx.
The passengers all agree that perfect
order and discipline prevailed on board
the Stella. The crew* promptly took up
their stations when the steamer struck,
served out the life belts and lowered
the boats.
The scene at the moment of the sink
ing of the vessel was heartrending.
Those who had succeeded in getting
into the boats had a narrow escape
from being engulfed on account of the
suction paused by the sinking vessel.
The voice of Captain Rooks from the
bridge was frequently heard urging the
rowers to pull -for their lives. The boats
were adrift fifteen hours, during which
their -occupants were without food or
water, and _as . their clothes were
drenched they suffered greatly.
"The disaster is generally attributed
to the high speed at which the steamer
was traveling in the fog.
The steamer Honfleur returned to
night, after having made the circle of
the Casquet rocks. She picked up two
boats containing woihen's clothing,
money, Jewelry and an opera glass case.
The last had evidently been used in
bailing. Many pathetic incidents are
reported. In several cases men lifted
their .wives and ran into the boats and
then perished- in heir presence. . ; One
wife who was thus bereaved lost her
reason. .
A large number of the survivors ar
rived here 'without any .clothing, clad
only in blankets: ...
* It is thought possible that the "Tar
tons were the only Americans on board,
as the list, of the survivors does not
contain the names of any other Ameri
cans so far as known. '
The second mate was the only officer
of the Stella who was saved.
LONDON, March 31.â The news of the
disaster to the Stella spread slowly
'ad been presented to you, and on that
account no further. action was taken at
that time. Now you created in the mind
of the court when you made that remark
a strong prejudice against your good in
tentions in this case. It felt that you
were guilty of a gross impropriety in ad
dressing the court on such a matter at
such a time, or, ln fact, at all; and the
court felt constrained to believe that
when you were bold enough to speak. on
such a matter your conduct should be re
garded with suspicion." â¢ ,
When Moore had expended his resources
endeavoring to lead the court Into the be
lief that his conduct was innocent in in
tent' Judge Lawlor ordered that his name
be withdrawn, from the box and informed
the juror that henceforth he would be
"excused" "from further duty on the
panel. â¢ . .
This did not close the scene, however.
District Attorney Murphy was in court,
and astounded the gathering by the state
ment that he was in possession of evi
dence that established his contention be
yond the peradventure of a doubt that the
jury had been tampered with and that ex
terior. Influences were responsible for the
verdict of acquittal.
"My proofs are Â«not yet ready for pre
sentation to the court." .said the District
Attorney. I will continue my investi
gations and when I have, matters in con
dition to proceed. -I shall, and the atten
tion of the Grand Jury will be called to
the matter and that body will doubtless
act thereon." . â¢
This closed the arraignment of the
jury, but the crowd had become excited
and jammed out through the door dis
cussing the situation in a loud and indig
nant manner. Rood was taken away to
rejoice over his escape, no matter how
it was effected. It is now "up to" Dis
trict Attorney Murphy, and the inter
ested will anxiously await developments.

small groups gathered at the Waterloo

the arrival of the" train from South- j
ampton this evening, which brought \
three of the survivors, David, King, a i
London merchant, Heilbron and Green- I
er, all of whom bore evident traces of I
their sufferings. King, who was among ;
the last to leave the ship, said:
Toward evening we encountered a
mist, which soon developed into a dense
fog. There was, however, no-apprehen
sion. Suddenly a. great Shock told us
that the Stella, had struck the rocks.
Screams rent the air. but the coolness of
the officers considerably allayed the ex
citement. The crew, behaved splendidly,
lowering the boats with the greatest
promptitude. Every woman was supplleu
with a life belt. At first we thought
there would be time enough for all tne
boats to clear away, but suddenly the
boilers burst -with a deafening report,
rending the ship amidships.
King and- two firemen, Osborne and
Bailey,. were the last to leave the ves
sel. King had just given up a life belt to
aid a clergyman's wife and was liter
ally pulled into a boat by Second' Mate
Reynolds, who was instrumental in
saving many lives.
The boat With * twenty-two persons
drifted for fifteen hours In the intense
cold, and was finally picked up by the
Great Western Railway's steamer Vera
from Southampton. King believes that
five boats were launched. He saw one
upturned with children clinging to it.
' The Cherbourg correspondent of the
Daily Mail says: The eight passengers
of the Stella who were landed here were
rescued from a boat that originally con
tained fourteen men. The boat capsized
and six were drowned. The others clung
to the keel for five hours and then man
aged to right the boat, which was half
full of water.
Other accounts say . that Captain
Rooks supposed the fog was merely in
banks, as is the usual experience, and
decided to run through it, but as it be
came continually -denser he lost his
bearings.
When the Stella struck there was a
terrible sensation, a noise of metal and
woodwork being torn away, the vessel
passing over the jagged rocks at full
speed and her side being ripped open
like matchwood. When she slid over
the rocks she turned completely over,
carrying a lot of people with her.
The eight survivors who were landed
at Cherbourg by the tug Marsouin were
picked off floating furniture vans by a
fishing-boat. The ladies on board one
of the lifeboats sang hymns all night
long to keep up the spirits of their
companions.
i Two bodies were washed ashore on
the island of Alderney.
One passenger says he remarked to
the crew on the high rate of speed at
which the Stella was traveling in the
fog, telling them, he did not consider it
safe.
â¢ The Daily Mail will publish to-mor
row dispatches from several passengers
urging the paper to demand a thorough
investigation as to whether the steamer
was racing against time.
The testimony of the passengers who
have arrived here confirms the early ac
counts of the disaster except that some
deny that the boilers exploded. Hopes
are still entertained that others may
have been picked up. There is no indi
cation* that there were any Americans
on board except Mr. and Mrs. Parton.
The steamer Stella, which belonged to
the London and Southwestern Railway
and ran in connection with its land
service, was built at Clyde Bank by
Messrs. J. &G. Thompson in 1890. She
was 253 feet long, 35.1 in width and 14.8
in draught. Her gross tonnage -was
1059, and her horsepower 495. She was
steel built, had two screws, eight com
partments, water ballast and triple ex
pansion engines, with schooner rig.

THE PLUM TREE
Whittier Reform School
Appointments.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 31.â The home
coming of Governor Gage has increased
speculation in regard to appointments
that affect the "Whittier Reform School.
Those who are "on the inside" insist that
the new Trustee may. be named before the
Governor returns to Sacramento and that
either A. M. Johnson or Colonel Richard
Eagan of San Juan Capistrano will be
named. The choice for the vacancy creat
ed by the expiration of President Mitch
ell's term has narrowed down with the
Governor to these two men. Johnson, who
is one of the partners in the Red Rover
mine, has known the Governor for years.
lie ls a heavy stockkholder In the -Union
Hardware and Metal Company of Los An
geles. The place Is his if he will accept it.
As soon as the new appointee is named
the board will reorganize with Dr. Walter
Lindley as president. The superinten
dent of the institution will go to either
Major M. T. Owens or Sherman Smith.
Should the former not be appointed he may
succeed Brigadier General Charles F. A.
Last as commander of the First Brigade,
National Guard of California. A strong,
effort is being made to have Mrs. Mitchell
retained as a member of the Whittier
board.
Senator Bulla will not be a candidate
for re-election next year. He says he has
all he wants of legislative work. Some of
Bulla's friends in the Los Angeles legis
lative delegation are considering the ad
visability of issuing a formal statement

PEKING, March 31.â The disturb
ances of the province of Shantung
during the whole winter have been
causing serious anxiety and have cul
minated in the imprisonment of a Ger
man priest at the town of Thine, ac
tually within 100 li (a li isÂ» approxi
mately three cable lengths) of the Ger
man sphere about Kiaoehau.
The facts regarding the attack on a
German officer and several companions
show that a German naval patrol, con
sisting of an officer and six men, was
landed at I-Chou, not at I-Tscho-Fu,
as cabled last night from Kiaoehau,
and advanced a short distance inland.
This patrol was met by & detachment
of Chinese soldiers, who fired upon the
Germans. . .'.-V . .
The officer in charge of the German
detachment caused the fire to be re
turned, killing several Chinese, but his
party was obliged to retire, and the
German admiral is landing a stronger
force to restore order. The presence of
nearly the whole of the German fleet
at Kiaoehau, it is believed, indicates
the possibility of extensive .operations,
and the Chinese, in consequence, are
seriously ; alarmed. ;V ;
The Tsung Li Yamen, in order to
show its desire to remove all possible
causes of friction, has dismissed three
magistrates voluntarily, although the
German Minister, Baron yon Heyking,
has been constantly pressing for their
disgrace. _â 
The fearful ravages of the Yellow
I River flood have caused terrible misery
and great discontent in the province of
Shantung, - and the - native officials
have been unable to maintain order.
The landing of the Germans is intended
to show the Chinese that if they are
unable to control the populace It is
i necessary for the foreigners to protect
I themselves.
The imprisonment of the German
missionary near the Germans' sphere
of influence about Kiaoehau is difficult
to explain, as the place mentioned is
within easy march of a German out
post.
The Chinese fear that the ; present
operations will expand the German ad
ministration to the 100-11 sphere.
MAGUIRE WILL NOT
BE A CANDIDATE
SAYS HE WELL NOT RE-ENTER
POLITICAL LIFE.
Judge James G. Maguire flatly de
nies the many rumors that have been in
circulation during the past week to the
effect that he will be a candidate for
Mayor at the coming election. He states
that he does not Intend to enter political
life during the next campaign or any of
the following campaigns. The rumors and
statements to the contrary that have been
; lately set afloat have been a source of
annoyance to Judge Maguire and when
j interviewed last night on the subject the
Judge vehemently denied the rumors.
"There la absolutely no truth ln the
i statements that I intend to be a candi
date for Mayor of the city at the com
ing election," said he. "You may state
positively that I have no intention of re
i entering political life at the present time.
I intend to devote all my time to the
practice of my profession. Yes, the law
will occupy all my time in the future and
I have absolutely no idea of becoming
a candidate for offlce at this time. What
the remote future will bring forth I know
not. but at the present time and in the
future as far as I can look ahead, I in
tend to give, as I said before, all __**. time
to the practice of law."

Special Correspondence of The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, March 27 (by
steamship Al-Ki to - Port Townsend,
March 31).â A wholesale murder of
goldseekers by Indians has in all prob
ability been committed near the mouth
of the Kuskokwim, one of the largest
rivers of Alaska, The Kuskokwim drains *
a watershed immediately south of the
lower Yukon River, and empties into
Bering Sea about 100 miles southeast of
Etolin Straits. Last spring sixteen men
from Kentucky fitted out a small
steamship, which they name, the Jes
sie, and sailed from San Francisco . for
the mouth of the Kuskokwim. There the
Jessie was wrecked in a storm, but the
crew and passengers got ashore, sav
ing the most of the cargo of provisions
and mining outfits. No particulars are
known here yet, but the report is that
the entire party was attacked while
asleep by a band of natives and killed
for the property they had. The men
have been missing for months and not
a word has been heard from any- of
them. The Kuskokwim is generally be
lievedâand even so far down in South
eastern Alaska as thisâ to flow through
a country, rich in minerals. It has never
been explored by white men. j ....
The news of the massacre of the Ken
tucky party reached . civilization, and
eventually the Interior Department at
Washington, D. C, which has taken
the matter up. Living at Kweegausute.
on Nunivak Island, about IGO miles
northwest of the mouth of the Kuskok
wim, and to the westward of Etolin
Straits, is a white trader who has an
Indian wife. Last summer while they
were in the Kuskokwim country she
overheard several natives quarreling
over the division of some property and
was told the story of the killing of a
party of whites who had come ashore â¢
from a small steamer which had been
wrecked.
This news eventually reached Seattle.
Congressm-m Ellis of Owensboro, Ky.,
laid the affair before the Interior De
partment and asked for an investiga
tion. The Interior Department, by Act
ing 'Secretary Ryan, who officiated in
the interim before the appointment of
the successor of Secretary Bliss, wrote
to Governor John G. Brady of Alaska
for information. As Governor Brady
was then in Washington laboring .in
behalf of Alaskan legislation, the cor
respondence went into the hands of A.
D.* Elliott, secretary of the District of
Alaska and acting Governor. , -.* f; -i*
He has written. the department in re
ply, stating that -there is so much ice
in and off the mouth of, the Kuskak
wim at this season as to make a trip
thither .very hazardous, but suggesting
that' next summer a Government rev
enue cutter or gunboat be sent with
one of the Commissioners for Alaska,
a Deputy United States Marshal and a
sufficient force to investigate the re
port and punish the natives.
Acting Governor Elliott is now here.
He did not bring the correspondence
from the Interior Department along
with him, and the names of the mur
dered Kentuckians he cannot call to
memory. ( They are said to be promi
nent people.
Mr. Elliott has promised to send the
names to me when he returns to Sitka
on the next steamer, but in the mean
time they, and perhaps additional par
ticulars, are on file in the Interior De
partment. v9_9sÃ-BpÂ£V__fiÃ*SÃp9â¬g

TO BE ISOLATED
FROM POLITICS
Chief Dunn Is on His
Way Hither. '
HE WILL REMODEL THE WORK
CUSTOMS INSPECTORS RETURN
TO THEIR POSTS.
All Members to Be Appointed by the
Secretary of the Treasury and
â¢ ' to Be Responsible to
Him.
News comes from Washington of a rev
olutionary change in the management of
the Chinese Bureau at this port. The
many scandals which have disgraced the
bureau for several years past in the Cip
rico-Williams-Meredith case, have, set the
Treasury ' Department to thinking seri
ously. The irresponsible and unsatisfac
tory composition of the local bureau, and
the report of Special Agents Smith and
Li nek with reference thereto, have been
carefully studied at Washington. Before
the appointment of . Rev. John E. Gardi
ner as Chinese Inspector and the arrival
hero of Chinese Inspectors Barbour and
Tippett, the work of the bureau was done
by Customs Inspectors appointed by the
Collector of Customs, or on his recom
mendation. No extra salary is received
by the customs officers acting as Chinese
Inspectors. Their occupation has been
changed without any change In emolu
ment, even the chief of the bureau re
ceiving only $4 per day.
As -these customs officers are subordi
nate to the Collector, the Treasury De
partment has deemed It advisable to di
vorce the bureau from the Custom House
and to make It an independent body, as
Is the Immigration Bureau, with its head
ancl all its members appointed by the
Secretary of the Treasury, and directly
responsible to him. This decision was ar
rived at a short time ago. and the first
step was taken at Washington yesterday
by the appointment of James R. Dunn as
chief of the Chinese Bureau at this port.
Chief Dunn is now on his way to this
city and is expected to arrive within a
few days. On his arrival, Customs In
spectors Lynch, Boyce, urquhart and
Chief Flesh will assume their. former du
ties as Customs inspectors under the au
thority of Surveyor S^jar. Gardiner,
Barbour and Tippett. being Chinese In
spectors appointed by the Secretary of
tho Treasury, will be retained, and this
force may be strengthened by one or two
additional Inspectors to be appointed also
by the Secretary. The falling off in the
number of Chinese immigrants arriving
since The Call began the agitation about
eight months ago has lightened the work
and fewer Inspectors will be needed in
the future than ln the past.
Mr. Dunn was a Deputy Surveyor of
Customs before his appointment as chief
of the Chinese Bureau, and his salary of
".â¢"000 per annum will be retained and prob
ably increased. Be was in charge of the
interests of the Government at the NaÂ«h
vllle and Omaha expositions, and has had
considerable experience with the wily
Chinese and his brokers.
The new arrangement will relieve the
Collector of the Port of much work and
trouble. He will be no longer indirectly
responsible for the sins of the bureau.
Have such as may arise through m lack
of watchfulness, and the members of the
bureau, being appointed by and directly
responsible to the Secretary of the Treas
ury, will be put upon their mettle, know-- ,
Ing that local political influences can
have no bearing on their official acts. . I
Another consideration which has had
weight with the Secret;. ry ln making the
change is that the chief of the bureau
â¢should be a man of higher standing and
responsibility than a simple customs in
spector. He will be less trammeled in
the performance of his duties, and if h*
makes mistakes those mistakes must bft
on the side of the Government, and not
on the side of the coolie brokers; other
wise he will be likely to lose his head
without as much ceremony as was waste
in the case of Chief Meredith.
NEWS FOR ANGLERS.
Late Dispatches Which Tell the Con

Judging from the number of anglers
who purchased tackle at the sporting
goods houses yesterday there will be a
large number of trout fishing disciples on
the early trains and boats that leave the
city to-day. Reports received at this of
flce > sterday from different points in the
country state that the main streams are
still high and of a milky color and that
the best catches will be made by anglers
who use oalt.
_ telegram from Duncans Mills states
that Austin Creek is high and that the
pools contain several large steelheads.
From Glen Ellen the reports received are
very flattering. The Sonoma is in prime
condition and the fishing In the vicinity
of Glen Ellen should be better than an
glers have witnessed in many years.

sluggish liver and bowels are taken up and
carried to all parts of the body. The con-
sequence is that the body is not only

ON TRACK AND FIELD.
Champion-hip Games at Berkeley.
Amateur Athletic League Con
tests Will Be Very Close.
At Berkeley this afternoon there will be
the championship spring field day. The
time is fast nearing. when the two col
leges, California' and Stanford, will fight
for the athletic honors- of the year. To
day's meet at Berkeley will determine the
team which is to represent the blue and
gold in the intercollegiate field day.
During the last month the California
athletes have been at work on the track
and field. The big gaps which were due to
the graduation of some of the old mem
bers of .the team are now filled by
younger blood. -After the performance
this afternoon judgment may be formed
on their merits.
Next Saturday Stanford and California
will cross bats Â»in the initial intercol
legiate baseball contest of 1599. Stanford
has done superior work ln the preliminary
games of the reason although* the ma
jority of victories In the triangular league
formed by the college nines and the Fire
man's Fund team went to the blue and

A week from to-day the Academic Ath
letic League will hold its championship
field day on the University of California
cinder track. This league comprises the
preparatory schools of the State and tho
championship games are as well attended
as the intercollegiate match contests be
tween Stanford and California, All the
first-class academies in the central por
tion of the State are- members of this
league, which numbers among its indi
vidual members some of the best young
athletes of the State.
The contest this year will be centered
among the teams representing the Lowell
High School of this city, the Polytechnic.
School, Oakland High School. Ukiah High
School and Berkeley High School. In
former years Oakland carried off the hon
ors quite consistently, but this year's
championship games will probably tell
another story. The local high school has
a first rate team and stands a good
chance of winning the pennant.

On the eve of his denarture for the. East
Fred Foster's ten thousand dollar invest
ment. Yehow Tail, the giant two-year
old son of imp. Watercress andPaloma,
captured a race at Oakland yesterday in
dashing style,, and may not? prove such a
counterfeit after all. In his early morn
ing workouts he scared the rail birds by
his terrific bursts of speed, and c the pad
dock crowd backed him to a standstill.
Asked- to beat a very moderate field, the
books laid as good as 7 to 10 against the
big fellow. Piggott had the mount, and
the youngster won pricking his ears,'
eased almost to a walk, a head before
Marcus Daly's Limerick. .THe four fur
longs was reeled off ln 49 seconds, but the
winner could have bettered this consider
ably. '.* -. _â¢â "- .* â¢:'- 'â¢'..': I
The card was a good, one and betting

, days past. The favorites, though, travel

i ones to earn brackets. Polka, Tiburon, a

By good judgment Eddie Jones "on
Polka, second choice for the opening
sprint, reached the wire a scant head be
fore Dolore. the favorite, with Piggott up.
Nothing else had a chance from the out-
j set.
Pocketed in the stretch. It at one stage
looked very dubious for Basseda. the 7 to
20 favorite for the first two-year-old
scramble, but Piggott extricated himself
near the paddock, winning easily. Ice
drop secured the place from Tanobe by a
; couple of lengths. - â¢" â¢;â¢.
Walter Jennings' black filly Sombre
'â  looked such a certainty for the fourth
i number that very scant odds were
laid against her. She showed no speed,
and, later Bullman's saddle slipping, the
: flllv finished among the "also rans."
Charley Macklln, astride Tiburon, a 30
| to 1 shot, rode a pretty race, leading An
i chored over the mark nearly two lengths.
The mile selling run went to Eddie
Jones, faultlessly ridden . by . Charley
I Thorpe. Opening a 7 to 5 ' choice, the
! colt's odds drifted to 3 to 1. In a hard
I drive Thorpe proved too strong a finlsner
i for Master Relff. beating Joe Ullman out
a short head on the wire with Moringa a
i nose further away. _*-'-_!_â 
| Torsida ruled a top-heavy choice for the
1 mile and a sixteenth affair and finished
1 third. After many trials and tribulations
Holmes managed to land Limewater win
ner, a head in front of Una Colorado, a
60 to 1 shot.
Track Notes.
The $2000 Palace Hotel handicap, at one
mile and a furlong,, will be the feature of
the card at Oakland this afternoon. A
large field will face the barrier, and the
race should prove quite as interesting an
affair as the Burns handicap.
Dr. Sheppard will start for the first
time in the colors of Burns & Waterhouse
. to-day. __ ' â 
"When" Earl Islington, a starter in the
opening scramble, fell on the back stretch
young Stimpson, his rider, was not seri
ously injured. The lad escaped with a
bruised ankle. *
Fred Foster loaded Abuse, Yollow Tall,
Sam McKeever, George H. Ketcham and
a couple of two-year-olds into a car and
departed for Chicago last evening. Fos
ter was unfortunate ln his speculations
here this season, but will probably try It
again next winter.
Tommy Lottridge, who sought to make
a rider of Ruiz, thinks an injustice was
done the lad 1 when the judges suspended
. him on Thursday for his handling of
Benameia. According to eye witnesses
the horse was practically left at* the post
and thp ridjr came in 'for cersure when
lie started ufter the field. In the sum
race Sir Urian was left J. at the post
'Frank Taylcr says Ber.amela is a "hard
luck" horse and attaches no blame to
Ruiz. The past reputation of the Spanish
boy was nor. the most glossy, but since
his reinstatement some days age. his rec
ord compares favorably with any of the
Jockeys riding. In seme instances officials
are prone to let ancient history take, pre
cedence over facts of the present.

THE HOUNDS ARE READY.
Dogs That Are in Superb Condition
for the Racing To-Day at Union
Park.
Another gigantic open stake will be run
at Union Park , to-day and to-morrow.
With ninety-six crackcrjacks in the run
ning, many being new performers to the
local sward, recently imported from the
Eastern States, together with the best
dogs lately running at Ingleside, the sport
on the two days named will border on the
sensational. Several of the entries are
many-times stake-winners and the talent
are at sea in picking the ultimate winner.
Lowe & Thompson start a new Eastern
bitch, Jessamy. by Lord Neversettle-
White Lips, but as she is drawn against
the great English dog. Interesting, she
looks to have a difficult course to nego
tiate.
Greyhounds new to tho Union Park
sward are St. Ellen, Eleven Spot, Flash
ing Lass, Bonnie Scotland, Handsome
Fortune, Olympus and Mamie Pleasant.
They are all said to be fast and clever
and needs must be to win out against
such company.
Many close courses will be decided this
afternoon and ln any one of the following
races the short-end should have an ex
cellent chance to raise the flag:
Scout vs. Lightfoot: St. Ellen vs. Lady Gil
more; O'Grady vs. Sharkey; Crosspath vs.
Lady Herschel; Soubrette vs. Mira Monte;
Beau Peep vs. Rosebud; The Devil vs. Thad
Stevens; Conqueror vs. Emln Pasha; Jennie
Wilson vs. Flyaway; Morning Glory vs. Vic
tor; Victor King '.' vs. Lord Byron; Pretender
vs. Tod Sloan; Olympus vs. Rollicking Airs,
and many others.'
Coursing will begin promptly to-day on
the arrival of the 12:"5 train from the city,
and the Southern Pacific Company, in an
ticipation of an enormous crowd, will run
an extra train at 12 o'clock, returning
from the park at 4:45 p. m.

HOSPITAL FORCE PARALYZED
. CHAS. LEDWITH FALLS DOWN
r A FLIGHT* OF STAIRS. Â°
He Is Taken to the Receiving Hos
. pital Suffering From Concussion
of the Brain and Recov
ers Consciousness. * -
Charles Ledwith, a night bartender in
Ben Tlley's p saloon, 17 Turk street, was
taken to the Receiving Hospital yesterday
morning suffering from concussion of the
brain, and when his pockets . were
searched the hospital attaches " thought
they had discovered a pawnshop. Â°
He had $525 50 in gold coin, $7 in cur
rency, $4 60 in silver, two Confederate cur
rency notes, two lady's gold watches and
a silver watch, one man's, gold watch,
chain and locket, two diamond rings, one
ring with a red stone, one ring with two
green stones, one plain gold ring, four
purses, a bunch of keys, a lady's gold pin
and a pair of gold cuff buttons. A slung
shot was also found in his pocket, and it
gave rise to the suspicion that something
was wrong. 3?f__!
Ledwith left the saloon yesterday morn
ing at 7 o'clock. Friends say that although
he had not been drinking since New Year,
he broke the pledge, as he felt blue, and
very little affected him from the fact that
some years ago he had his skull fractured
while working as a tin-roofer for J. T. M.
Gullfoy on Eighth street.
The landlady of the Parker House, 1122
Market street, saw him come upstairs
shortly before 9 o'clock to the landing
where she happened to be, and as he
reached -the top he staggered and feil
backward to the bottom. Two men came
in from the. street and helped him to his
feet, and then the ambulance was sum
moned and he was sent to the hospital.
* He recovered consciousness late yester
day afternoon, and on being questioned
by Detective ODea he admitted that he
had been drinking, and claimed that the
money and jewelry were his property. He
.carried them around for safety, as his
room had been entered twice in the Devon
House within a few months and looted.
He said 'he had no recollection of falling i
and was surprised to find that he was in
the hospital. He got the slungshot sev
eral nlr-hts ago, as there had been a row
in the saloon and- he wanted something
with which to protect himself.
Ledwith . is known to be a crank for
cheap jewelry and will buy anything of
the kind or lend money on it. He had
$250 and some jewelry and watches In the
safe of his friend, W. H. Hughes, a sa
loon-keeper, on Howard street who went
out of business recently, and he had car
ried them around with him since, besides
other money and articles.
Ledwith's wife called at the hospital
and said that two diamond studs in his
shirt front were missing. It appeared that
the two men who came to his aslstance
tore open his shirt, and it is suposed* that
the studs were pulled out and lost.
The police at first thought that an at
tempt might have been made to rob Led
with, but that idea was abandoned, and
then It was thought that he might have
been using the slungshot for something '
besides self-protection, but that Idea was |
also abandoned. : r *;-' *>
A WAR BETWEEN
DELIVERY COMPANIES
DETAILS OF BAGGAGE TRANS
FER TRUST.
Facts and Figures Brought to Light
Through the Medium of a Jus
tices' Court Suit.
! A suit filed In the Justices' Court yes
i terday discloses the somewhat perplexing
j details of a parcels delivery trust, the cx
i istence of which it is safe to say has
| heretofore been unknown even to i those
who pay attention to such matters.. The
suit is against the Pacific Transfer Com
pany, the plaintiff Morton Bros.' Special
Delivery Company.
It appears from the complaint that in
December, 1896, the two transfer com
panies entered into an agreement where
; by competition was to end between them.
. The conditions of the compact were that
j the defendant company should pay over
to Morton Bros, on the 10th day of each
month one-third of the net profits of the
previous month's business, it being un
derstood and agreed that the amount to
be so paid should never fall below the
! sum of $500. The firm of Morton Bros,
] on its part agreed to pay each month
to the defendant company one-third of
the gross receipts derived from the busi
ness of handling baggage to and from
the ferry depot and wharves.
So far as is known, things progressed
I smoothly under this agreement until the
[ summer and fall of last year. The com
: plaint avers that for the months of June,
: July, August, September and October the
one-third of the gross receipts due the
defendant compnny amounted to $282 70.
,To offset this there was due plaintiff
j from the defendant company the sum of
j $2500, being $500 for five months. Of this â 
I amount $2054 45 was paid on account, I
; leaving a balance due of $162 85. It ls for
r this amount that suit is brought.

INSURANCE MEN
GROW TIRED OF
COMPETITION
New Organization to
Be Formed. o â¢
WILL CONTROL CITY BUSINESS
BID FOR A COMBINATION OP
... LOCAL COMPANIES.
Should All Not Come In There Will
Be War to the Knife WitU
Those Who Stay
Out.
There Is food for all kinds of eossip in i
the insurance situation at present ex- :
isting in this city. There are plans on
foot to revolutionize the entire local
business and bring all* the city compa- !
nies under the control of a local board, j
Should the plan succeed there will be
peace and harmony and low rates and j
general congratulations over the im- j
proved conditions, but should it fail there i
will be rate cutting and mutilated com- |
panics strewn over the downtown streets, j
All these secret meetings have not been '
for the pleasure of convening and talk- j
ing over the best way to word a policy !
or how to make the uninsured insure; it I
is the question of competition which has *
taken up most of the time, and the.best i
means to prevent too much and too j
strong competition has been the subject !
of those long talks in Monterey and at <
the Cliff House.
;' At present the Pacific Coast Board of |
Underwriters control most of the insur- i
ance of this coast. . It has the greater i
number of the large _ companies on this
list, and the companies belonging to it j
are bound to have dealings only with the
other members of the compact. But there j
is a sufficient number of companies who \
have not joined the compact to maintain !
a continual menace to the plans and
rates and commissions of the compact i
companies, and they have grown to be a
thorn in the side -of the more powerful
organization. The companies on the
outside are not bound to keep up rates,
and so as a rule' they make rates ior
themselves just a little below those of
the compact companies, and increased
business is the result. The board has at
various times offered inducements to the
outside companies to come into the fold,
but there are certain rules of the board,
principally one relating to city agents,
which have proved objectionable. tne
board is bound by rules which suit tne
coast but not exactly the local condi
tions, and so the idea is now being put
forth that the local companies should get
together and form the San Francisco Fire
Insurance Exchange, a body to be gov
erned In accordance with the needs and
conditions of city business.
To this end the work of the board dur
ing its last session has been mainly di
rected and many of â¢ the rules adopted
have been with a view to strengthen the
new organization. They have in the first
place decided to curtail the number of
men doing business as insurance men,
but who have taken it up as a side issue.
There are many real estate firms who
transact a small insurance business on
the side, and there are many more who,
controlling insurable property, farm out *
the policies to whoever will give the high- !
est commission. It is the intention to stop â¢
such work so far as is possible.
The question of city agents has also j
been given much argument, and also the I
Propriety of allowing one offlce to have i
oth board and non-board companies un- J
der its control. Other questions on rates j
and rebates and commissions have been
Under discussion, and all with a view to
this new organization which is contem
plated.
The board companies, it Is understood,
will be willing to come down to the rates
and the commissions charged and paid by
the non-board companies, and "they will
make other concessions in order to have
the support of all the companies, but if
they do not come into the new organiza- j
tion It looks as if a war will be, on. Board I
companies will be authorized to violate I
the rate cutting rule of the board and I
make rates under any offered by any one
of the outsiders. The situation has be
come so strained that it has come to a
point where peace or war must exist,
and the big companies have decided to try
peace first.
The upshot of it â¢___' seems to be that
rates will drop and will stay lower for
some time to come.
It was reported on the street yesterday
that the Union Company of London, one
of the Catton Bell Agency's companies,
had been expelled from the board. The
report proved incorrect, however, for the
action of the board amounted only to a
vote of censure. The agency had violated
one of the rules relating to commissions.
REPORTS OF OFFICIALS.
â¢ s
No Law Requiring That They Be
Printed Either Monthly or
Quarterly.
City and County Attorney Lane has
filed with the Board of Supervisors a
written opinion in which he holds that
there is no law requiring" municipal of
ficials to cause to be printed monthly or
quarterly reports of the affairs of their
respective offices. Also with reference to
charges that may be made by the official
paper of the city. ' The opinion is as fol
lows:
You have requested my opinion as to
"whether or not all monthly or quarterly or
any reports of municipal officials are required
by law to be advertised in the Evening Post
newspaperâ the official organ of the .city and
County Of San Francisco"; also whether said
newspaper "Is entitled to charge its regular
rates for publishing said 'reports . when re
quired." . .
In reply I beg to state: (1) I know of no
provision of law requiring the monthly or quar
terly reports of municipal officials to be pub
lished In any particular newspaper, whether
designated "official" or otherwise. (2) The
contract between the city and the Evening Post
only covers "orders, -resolutions and authoriza
tions, notices and other publications and adver
tisements published or caused to be published by
the Board of Supervisors or the clerk thereof." I
For any other advertising which it may receive
from th* city or c its authorized officials the
Evening- Post or any other paper is entitled
to charge its regular rates.
ARTILLERY WILL SOON SAIL.
Four Batteries for Honolulu and
Three for Manila.
The four batteries of the Sixth United
States Artillery, which have been ordered
to Honolulu, will leave here about April
12 on the Nippon Maru. Major S. M. Mills,
Sixth United States Artillery, has been
assigned to the command of the battal
ion, which will consist of Batteries A, I,
X and N. Batteries I and X. are now at
Fort Monroe, Va., and Battery A at St.
Francis barracks, Florida. Battery N is
one of the new batteries to be organized.
The three light batteries ordered to Ma
nila will leave about the middle of April.
The officers and men will go either on
the Newport or the Morgan City. The
companies of the Twenty-fourth Infan
try, assigned to the Department of Cali
fornia, are expected here within three
days and will be stationed at the. Pre
sidio and Alcatraz. Eight New Yorkers
were mustered out yesterday, leaving
only two men of the regiment remaining,
who are too ill to leave the hospital.
No Matron for the Morgue.
The request made by Coroner Hill to
the Supervisors for authority to employ
two women to serve as - matrons at the
Morgue was denied yesterday by the
Health and Police Committee. The rea
son assigned was that no funds are avail
able. X'm^WmmmWSSm*^m*mi:
A New Rifle Range. ..
A committee of the Supervisors reported
favorably â  yesterday upon the application
of the Glen Park Company for permis
sion to construct* a rifle range on their
property out Ingleside way. -The range
is to be so constructed as to preclude all
possibility of accident.

LOGIC OF RAILROAD X ABSOLUTISM.
WHEN .Mr. â¢ Huntington' . reaches 'this \ State,' if
he. regards *. his v railroad* combination' â¢ as *. the
local government',. he "should devise sonic plan
and promulgate some "new edict" for the fulfillment of
those ordinary obligations' which even. the Czar of
Russia usually acknowledges. If the unfortunate
fanners in -Monterey -'County, 'whose families were
temporarily reduced to "destitution, by a drought, for
which they were not responsible, had been allowed
to retain. or had been returned even a small portion of
the freight money- they. had paid the railroad, their
necessities would have been adequately relieved. But
from that quarter no assistance beyond the grudged
use of a few cars for the transportation of provisions
was extended. These farmers belonged to the best
class of American citizens, and for the moment were
in need of help through conditions that were excep
tional, and it would have been an affront to them that
would have been justly resented if they had been
treated as objects of private charity. However il
logical the doctrines of socialism may be, there is. a
sound fraternal sentiment, most completely realized
through American individualism, that, in such cases
as this, compels the fulfillment even by governments
of the royal law. But the railroad acknowledges no
other rule than the right to cut out its pound of flesh
whenever it pleases, although dripping with Ameri
can blood. '". â¢
In modern times imperialism has improved and
obeys some humanitarian duties. If the railroad is the
state and entitled to appropriate such proportion of
the profits of industry as it pleases, then at least it
should make formal arrangements to perform its cor
relative obligations, and should not cast them upon
other citizens who are chronic rebels against its
despotism and its exactions.
BALLOT REFORM WISDOM.
IN the course of an interview a few days ago Sen
ator Stratton, author of the Stratton primary law,
under whose supervision much of the reform bal
lot legislation enacted by the late Legislature was
passed, made some remarks with reference to the
new Rickard law which are worthy of reproduction.
"The provision in the Rickard law," said Senator
Stratton. "against placing on the ballot the tickets
of independent conventions will not work in favor of
the bosses if the good citizens go to the primaries
and secure control of the regular conventions.
Whenever the. bosses fail to get control of a conven
tion they organize a rival independent convention.
This has been done more than once in San Fran
cisco. They cannot run an independent ticket on the
ballot now. The Rickard law may bring citizens out
for the primaries who would otherwise be negligent.
Heretofore they have relied on independent move
ments, but they cannot do so any longer." â¢ '
This is pure and unadulterated wisdom, and it is re
spectfully recommended to the hysterical. editor of an
esteemed morning Democratic contemporary.. Sen
ator Stratton's primary law, if it has -any purpose
whatever, is designed to give the people a chance to
unhorse the bosses. . It provides for lawful primaries,
at which every good citizen may vote for delegates to
his party convention. For any one to allege. that the
political bosses can capture conventions and" foist upon
the people unrepresentative candidates 'when every
body goes to the primary ballot-boxes and votes is
to make a statement calculated only to engage the
attention of men who have to be confined in padded
cells. â Â° 'â¢
The Rickard -ballot law is the legitimate offspring
of the Stratton primary law. Senator Stratton says
he could not see this and he opposed its enactment.
But with all due respect to him, we adhere to the
conclusion formerly expressed, that an alphabetical
system under the legal convention plan set up by the
new primary law would be a downright absurdity. If
the people are to have legal conventions and legal
tickets, the latter should be protected upon the bal
lot, for the party designation of a legal convention
will possess significance which should not be ob
scured by "piece clubs" and so-called "independent"
movements. -
It is our opinion that if the Stratton primary law is
a success the Rickard ballot law will be a desideratum,
the value of which can scarcely be overestimated.
Otherwise, it may be otherwise.
When a Filipino will not fight Aguinaldo has him
killed, and when he will fight as likely as not he runs
against an American soldier with a loaded gun. The
only safe course of the Filipino would seem to be to
take, to the woods.
Alger wants the army supplied with a candy ration.
It would seem that the death rate inaugurated by bad
beef would be all that the undertaking combine could
in reason have asked.
THE CORRUPTION OF ' YOUTH.
WITH the invention which has made possible
the "mutoscope," the "artoscope" and all the
other forms of exhibition in which pho
tography is given a semblance of the movements of
life, a new instrument has -been placed in the hands
of the vicious for the corruption of youth.; They
have been' prompt to take advantage of it,- They
have copied pictures in which nude art has been car
ried to the extreme of indecency, they have induced
vile women to pose in half nudity, and of these they
have made scenes to tempt the depravity of manhood
and the curiosity of youth.
These vicious exhibitions arc displayed in San
Francisco with an effrontery that is as audacious as
it is shameless. In an investigation of the extent to
which the evil is carried on along our "principal
streets The Call yesterday â  exposed the . fact that a
considerable . number " of . the patrons of such place- j
are schoolboys, some of them so small they haje to j
be lifted in the arms. of their larger companions to
bring their eyes on a level with the aperture in the
machine through which the pictures are seen.
Beneath the depth of this open depravity there is,
moreover, a lower depth which the proprietors of the
places disclose to those who arc known to them. For
the gratification of such patrons even the slightest
pretenses of decency are thrown aside and a degra
dation as low as that of the slums of Chinatown is.
presented in foul pictures displayed in the vitascope
and ribald songs clinked out from the phonograph.
These vicious exhibitions are the more dangerous
to society because they are given under the guise of
scientific novelties of invention and new achieve
ments in mechanical and electrical art. In that form
they attract large numbers of persons who are not
depraved and have no desire for the indecent. By
the patronage of such visitors an air of respectability
is given to the places of exhibition, and parents have
no objection to make when their children go there
to spend their nickels.
' For a time the proprietors of the exhibitions con
ducted their places with much outward show of de
cency, but now they have become bold. The ma
chines, in which the. pictures are placed are plainly
marked with signs intimating the depravity of the
scenes within, and these occupy prominent positions
in their showrooms. ' It is therefore no longer pos
sible for the public to overlook the affront given to
its morals and its laws. It is difficult, indeed, to un
derstand how even the police can.have been blind to
it for so long a time. â¢
It is not a pleasant subject to deal with, and The
Call would have gladly turned aside from it had it*
been aware of any way to suppress the evil other
than by exposing it. It now directs to all of these
so-called phonograph and mutoscope parlors the at
tention of the police, the Society for the Prevention
of Vice and the public generally. A good step was
taken for reform and the welfare of society when
the- notorious gamblers of Ingleside were "compelled
to give up the nefarious trade which was tempting
large numbers of people to evil courses leading to
dishonor and suicide, and now another step in the
same direction can be taken by the suppression of the
indecent pictures and songs that are corrupting the
youth of the city.
It is not necessary to enact a new ordinance to
cover the subject. The present law suffices. All that
is needed is an aroused public sentiment and ener
getic action on the part of the police. The exposure
made by The Call has been sufficient to show the
nature of the offense and point out some of the more
conspicuous places where it is carried on. It is now
the turn of the police to act.
ILLEGAL (-ADVERTISING AGENTS.
A QUESTION involving the right of corpora
tions to act as advertising agents, when, no
such business has been included in the articles
of incorporation, has been raised in the city of New
York and can be studied with interest and advantage
throughout the country. It is an issue which affects
all legitimate advertisers and deserves their attentive
consideration. In a recent issue of Leslie's Weekly
the case is thus presented:
Â» It has been stated that the Manhattan Elevated
Railroad of New York declined to grant the re
quest of Richard Croker for the use of the elevated
structure to carry the pipes of a compressed air com
pany because, among other reasons, the elevated
railroad, under its charter, had no right to make
such an agreement. The charter of the elevated
railroad was granted for the purpose of carrying
passengers in this city and for nothing else. Alder
man Okie, one of the best men in the board, under
stands the situation, and he is in favor of strictly
limiting the operations of the Manhattan Elevated
to the rights granted by its franchise. The' Edi
torial Association of the State of New York has ap
pointed a committee to request the Governor and
Attorney General of this State to insist that the
elevated and the surface railways discontinue the
advertising business, which is now done in violation
of their charters. Publishers of newspapers, maga
zines and other periodicals feel, therefore, that they
have a right to enter a protest against illegitimate
competition by corporations chartered exclusively
for transportation purposes. It is estimated that
more than $2,000,000 annually is diverted from the
regular channels of advertising by the various street
railways in the cities of the United States. . It is
remarkable that this abuse has been tolerated so
long and so patiently.
It is not in New York only that corporations have
thus transcended the powers granted by their charters. !
Street" car and ferry companies are in this way
offenders on a large scale. They carry on an adver
tising trade to an extent which makes their cars- and
their boat's veritable moving billboards plastered with
advertisements of every sort and kind. From the
trade they derive a large revenue, every dollar of
which is illegally obtained by acts done in violation of
their chartered privileges.
A flagrant illustration of the boldness with which
some corporations engage' in the advertising trade
without a chartered right to do so is to be found in
the fact that the Market Street Railway Company
of this city, not content with using all of its cars for
advertising purposes, sets apart some of them exclu
sively to advertising. It parades up and down the
street a car in which the people are not permitted to
ride, the whole service of the car being to carry a
brass band and attract public attention to the thing
advertised.
It is clear that if the Manhattan Elevated Railroad
Company of New York cannot legally carry the pipes
of a compressed air company neither can it legally
.carry the advertisements of that or any other com
pany or person. The same rule applies to corpora
tions throughout the Union. They are granted the
privilege of carrying on certain specified kinds of
work, and when they go beyond that they are violat
ing the law.
The legitimate advertisers of New York have done
well in protesting against the continuance of this il
legitimate competition. The evil is a growing one,
and it is high time strong efforts were - made to
check it.
There is not much to say about the individual who
sends over a telephone wire a false message that
another individual is dead. He is simply a fool, and
perhaps not to be held strictly accountable. .
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 1, 1899.
warfare: in the tropics.
AN American publicist has collected the sanitary
statistics of England and France relating to
their military service in their tropical armies of
occupation and conquest. " Wherever possible the
British military stations in India are located in a dry
climate, as heat and. humidity together are recognized
as a partnership of deathly influence. The British
army in India consists of 70,000 men , and officers.
Their -average annual hospital admissions are 97,738,
or 1386 hospital cases for each 1000 men. The aver
age number of days each soldier is sick is 34.35, and
the number in each thousand constantly sick is 93.85.
As these include the dry stations in the hills, the
showing is better than that made by the hot and
moist camps. Taking Ahmedaibad as an average of
the latter, the hospital admissions are 3417 to each
1000 men, or more than three to each man. One-half
the cases are the tropical malarial fevers which sap
the constitution. Of 2493 men stationed at Allahabad
the annual average suffering from cholera, smallpox,
enteric, yellow and other fevers, is 631; from malarial
fevers, 381; from the dreadful constitutional disease
of vice, 1228, and from other diseases 1375, making
the total annual hospital admissions yearly 3615.' The
Royal Fusiliers, numbering 931 men, have 118 con
stantly sick; the First Royal Welsh, numbering 877,
have 140 constantly sick. For the dreadful and in
eradicable constitutional disease referred to 112 in
each 1000 are treated in Scotland, 123 in Ireland and
153 in England, of the home troops, while in the
tropical forces the number is 314 in the West Indies
per 1000, 333 in Ceylon, 359 in China, 479 in the
Straits Settlements, and 522 in India. In the Rohil
khand district the number of such cases is 711 per
1000 men.
It must be remembered that in the Philippines our
army of conquest and occupation has to face both
heat and moisture, and all the physical and moral
dangers which long experience has failed to guard
against in the British army. In a campaign of ten
months in Madagascar the French army of 12,850
men, without any hard battle, lost 4189 men, or 325
of every 1000. One battalion made a forced inarch
upon Tsarasotra, and all died of disease on the way,
not one living to reach the objective.
In the first year of our war in the tropics eleven
men died of disease to one of battle causes. Yet the
main body of our army sojourned but briefly under a
vertical sun, and most of them were near our base
of supplies.
Until we get the uncensored statistics of our opera
tions in the Philippines the sanitary facts of our cam
paign there will be unknown, but there is no reason
to believe that we are escaping the consequences of
tropical occupation which have fallen so severely
upon the armies of every country that has set its feet
in that hot and poison path to glory.
Kipling, who was born in Bombay and was sent to
England to be reared arid educated, returning to
India for his career, has set forth vividly the results
of camp life there. The "White Man's Burden" is
not imposed solely by the intractable tropical races,
but is the curse of a climate to which the natives are
immune, but which can never be innocuous to the
temperate zone races. - ,_
It is a grave question in economics whether the
profits of trade secured by any northern people from
the tropics has paid for the sacrifice of money, life
and health required in securing it by conquest, mili
tary occupation and forced labor. by conquest, mili
occupation and forced labor,
In their normal state, and controlled by indigenous
races, the tropics would yield a certain volume of
trade for the temperate zone nations. It was this
natural trade that fattened Venice and Genoa. When
it is substracted from the volume secured by con
quest, ownership and military occupation, a basis is
furnished on which to estimate the actual returns of
such ownership and offset it to the cost.
It is certain that the nations which have such
ownership do not make pay to public revenues. The
It is certain that the nations which have such
,-nership do not make it pay in public revenues. The
tropical colonies of Spain showed a deficit in revenues
to cost of government for thirty years before she lost
em. Holland has had a deficit of colonial revenues
since 1877. ' . *
It may be said that while the public revenues have
not paid the cost of government, private individuals
have been enriched. 'No doubt this is true, but out
of it arises the grave question of the right of a na
tion to hold a subject people in bondage at public
cost while they are exploited for private profit.
SOME SALT LAKE ELOQUENCE.
AS we journey through life, dizzied and half
. stunned by the uproar of a thousand dis
cordant noises, it is worth while to pause and
listen whenever the rhapsody of fluent eloquence
rings out above the general din and offers to the
wearied mind something in the way of intellectual
inspiration.
A voice of that kind comes to us from Salt Lake
through the pages of our very much esteemed con
temporary, the Tribune. Answering the supposed
question of a foreigner as to how many States there
are in the Union, the Tribune says:
"Forty-five States and some Territories; they fill all
the space between the two great oceans, and at one
bugle-call last summer in every one soldiers fell into
line; the tread of the thousands was like the tolling
of the bells of destiny, and the flashings of their stan
dards reflected back the sunlight through one-eighth
of the sun's daily round. And they all speak one lan
guage, all sing the same songs; all turn for inspira
tion to the same flag: 'and though" each is a separate
wave, when blended they make but one ocean, and
when in full roar all the shores of the nation are
shaken, for in majesty, in latent power, in unap
proachable splendor, there is no counterpart for them
in all the records of the nations that have existed,
since nations were first organized on earth."
Considered as an answer to a simple question in
political geography, that passage deserves to take
rank among the highest ever penned, and, moreover,
it is all true, as is ever the case with a genuine elo
quence. ' When we have conquered Aguinaldo and
set about the work of educating the Filipinos they
should be compelled to commit that to memory as the
first lesson. It might be advisable to send a copy of
it to Kaiser William also. There are several kinds of
instruction in it for several sorts of people, so it ought
to go the rounds and find a place in every well regu
lated scrapbook.
Perhaps the fact that a man recently hanged in
Missouri fell through the same gallows that had been
fatal to his father years before will give students of
heredity something to think about.
Those Cubans do not seem to appreciate the fact
that half a loaf.is better than no bread, and if they
shall not soon acquire appreciation they won't have
even the half-loaf.
Ex-President Jewett of the California Pioneers has
an almost unexampled faculty for the heaping up of
gold bricks.
While the army of Aguinaldo is doubtless disin
tegrating, there will be trouble in apprehending the
fragments. Â°
GAGE'S UNJUST POCKET VETO.
_ ia
One of the bills pocketed by Governor Gage carried an appropriation of g
$2**,000 for the reimbursement of Claus Spreckels for money advanced tne g*
State several months ago to aid "destitute people in Monterey and San L-uis Â£
Obispo counties. This bill passed the Legislature without any opposition, its fc
purpose was to provide for ! the payment' of a debt of honor, me (governor m
should have signed it without any hesitation. .If any legal reasons may oe m
urged against the validity of the claim he should have given the courts an .
opportunity to pass upon them. To pursue any other course was to lay mm- Â£*
self open to the suspicion that his anger at John J). Spreckels influenced Â«
him to treat Claus Spreckels unjustly. * - Â° . _-â¢â __â  Â§
It Is not at all discreditable to Mr. Spreckels that he is a rich man. mo,-.**'
body has ever accused him of making his money dishonestly. He has tne rep- **-;
utatibn of paying his employee good wages and with dealing fairly witn ail %â 
with whom he has business relations. He Is a shrewd, "sagacious, level- Â£
headed, far-seeing business man, and he is entitled to full credit for nay- g
ing achieved so many notable financial successes. - , *5
No worthy charity ever appealed to Clans Spreckels and went away -Q
empty-handed. He has given more substantial aid to public and private en- g
terprlses intended to â  develop "the retirees of the State than any . other **v
millionaire in the history of California. His successes have not turned his \
. head or made him forget California, the source of most of his wealth. eg
A change of fortune has not afft ed his loyalty to this State. He is the .*Â»
same straightforward, unaffected, clear-headed, public-spirited and enterprls- gg
ing business man, ready at all times to demonstrate his faith in .California Â£â¢
and loyalty to local interests by Investing his money in local enterprises. gg
It was Claus Spreckels* capital that first opened the way for honest com- gg
petition in transcontinental transportation. " It is his capital that now gives O
promise of ' freeing the people of San Francisco from the exactions and ex- *
tortions of two of the greatest monopolies that now impede the progress of gs
that city. ' -V;;'. * <5
He does not go away from California to invest his millions so long-as 8
there is an opportunity to Invest them in State enterprises. His wealth has 0
come from the production and development of the resources of the* country, jo
It is not the result of usury and oppression. The State is -therefore con- *Â£
stantly receiving the benefit of his enormous resources. He. is constantly *Â°
adding to the wealth and the resources of California and is therefore, more ~
than any other California millionaire, lending a helping hand to labor. Â£?
For these things, and many others not necessary to here enumerate, \ c -j
Claus Spreckels deserves the confidence and respect of the, people of this A
State. The loss of the money is. of but little moment, but in refusing to can- '.*
eel this debt of honor California has put an affront upon one of her best V
and most public-spirited citizens. The Governor may be able to justify his 2!
action in this matter, and if he is he should lose no time in doing so. As long &
as he remains silent his motives are certain to be questioned.â Woodland. Â£

Gleasor) Mixed Up. : Â°7.
The Hornet, a bright little paper pub
lished at Houlton, Me., tells the following -
story "about Colonel John P. Irish:
Mr, John P. Irish, who made such a _
stirring speech at the Indianapolis con-"
vention, has for several years been recog
nized as one of the most eloquent orators
on -he Pacific Coast. He is a resident of
San Francisco, and is best known in the
West through his connection with the
Southern Pacific Railroad.
The day after he made his speech Mr. **
Irish was a good deal of a hero and was
much sought after by delegates who
wished to congratulate him. At the same
hotel where he was staying the Hon. '
Patrick J. Gleason, the renowned Celtic
Mayor of Long Island City, was a guest.
As the big-fisted Mayor was sitting in
the lobby a bellboy approached him and
asked:
"Are you Irish?" ; . ' *
"I am thot," replied Gleason; "but what *
makes you ask, sonny?"
"That man over there told me to." re
sponded the boy, pointing out a stranger.
Gleason was half inclined to be wrathy.
He was puzzled also, but he waited. Soon
after the stranger came up to him,
slapped him on. the shoulder and re-'**
marked, "That was a fine speech you
made yesterday, Irish."
"Look here!" said Gleason, turning .
fiercely on the stranger. "I'm Irish and
I, ain't ashamed of it; but I'll be if
I'll have any whiskered jay call me so to
me face." â¢ ;*_'"
"Whyâ ah," gasped the stranger, "I
thought you were Mr. Irish of San Fran
cisco. Iâ was told so."
"Oh!" said Gleason. Then there were
drinks. 'â  â â *.*â¢-â *â :â¢ â¢"â â â ' T-'2"^\ _,_,_ _,
Colonel Irish was born about .fifty-five
years ago in lowa City, lowa, where he
lived until ISBO. In that year he removed
to San Francisco and edited the i Alta
California, which was for a long time the
leading newspaper on the Pacific Coast.
He has had a varied political career, but
never met with much success, having
been successively defeated as candidate
for the State Legislature, Congress and
Governor. He was appointed Naval

SCHOONER STELLA ERLAND.
SHE left here on February 26 last for Amapala, Honduras, and
news came from Ensenada yesterday that she had been totally
wrecked, but the crew was coming back to San Francisco on
the steamer Curacao. The Stella Erland was in command of Pro
fessor A. W. Anthony and he was accompanied by eight sailors
and scientists. There were thirty tons of dynamite aboard and as
soon as that was unloaded at Amapala the schooner was to be
headed for the islands of the Southern Pacific.
dalena Bay. The crew managed to save
themselves In a skiff after the lifeboats
had been stove in. They made their way
to': Magdalena Bay. where they were
picked up by the coast steamer Curacao,
bound from Guaymas to San Francisco,
via Ensenada. The schooner and cargo
are a total loss. The shipwrecked crew
arrived at Ensenada to-day.
When the shipwrecked crew arrived at
Magdalena Professor Anthony went at
once to the Comandante, Antonio Ma
geria. to whom he presented his papers
and explained his situation, but that
officer refused to give him any assist
ance. Professor Anthony revisited the
wreck and rescued several hundred dol
lars' worth of stores. When he brought
these to Magdalena the customs officers
offered, him $100 for them. He refused
their offer and they confiscated the whole
lot. Professor Anthony protested against
this proceeding, but to no avail. He then
asked for enough of the stores to subsist
his crew until he could get away, but to
this request also Mageria turned a deaf
ear. Being left entirely without provis
ions, the crew were forced to live as best
they could at Magdalena until the Cura
cao arrived.
â  On reaching Ensenada Captain Anthcny
filed a formal protest with American Con
sul Taylor against the action of Com
andante -Mageria and the matter will
be vigorously investigated.
On the night of the 18th, during a heavy
fog, the schoner ran Into a strong cur
rent and was borne out of her course. At
a quarter after 12 she went aground with
out the slightest, warning. The sea was
heavy and the crew hurriedly abandoned
her. and some of them escaped only in
their night clothes. They then carried
their boat two miles overland to . a. lagoon
rowed to Magdalena. *"*:' .;â¢'â¢; ' - .."â¢.â¢,''â¢.:â¢..

SUPERVISORS SEE NO WAY OUT
OF THE MAZE. I
Street Light Committeemen Go on
Record as Strongly Opposed to
a Municipal Plant.
The Supervisors find themselves in a â 
tangle regarding the matter of lighting
the city, from which they flnd it difficult
to find a way out. The Street Light Com
mittee met yesterday afternoon and tried ;
in vain to solve the matter.
Conflicting resolutions were adopted last ,
Monday at the board meeting, and it was j
the intention of the committeemen yes- i
terday to reconcile these. To do so Su- i
pervisor Holland moved that a resolution '
passed on Monday be amended. This res
olution provided that the board would ,
continue to pay gas bills under the old j
contract until the question of its validity
be finally determined by the Supreme
Court.
Mr. Holland had struck out the words.
"Until the question is determined by the (
Supreme Court," and in their place in-
Betted "until the Ist day of July. 1599. the

to exact from the persons securing the
contract an. indemnifying bond in a suf- |
ficient amount to protect the Supervisors [
if the Supreme : Court should hold the
present contract, which expires in July
of next year, valid. â¢ \ .
The members of the committee went on '
record as being opposed to a municipal
lighting plant.. As they were not In sym
pathy with it the matter was referred to
the men who; voted for It originally. These
are Perrault, Lackmann, Bylngton, Deasy
and Heyer. â  Supervisor Holland volun
teered the opinion that it is not practi
cable* for a municipality to own a light

GOOD FRIDAY
OBSERVED WITH

Special Services in the
Churches.
WORSHIPERS OUT IN FORCE
INSPIRING CEREMONIES AT THE
CATHEDRALS. .
Stirring Sermons and Sacred Music
Are Features of the Episcopal
ian Programme â Impres
sive Catholic Ritual,
Good Friday was solemnly observed in
the various Catholic and Episcopal
churches of this city yesterday, and
throughout the day the sacred edifices
were crowded with worshipers.
The religious functions at St. Mary's
Cathedral began at 9 o'clock in the morn
ing with a short lesson from the prophe
cies in the Old Testament, bearing on the
action of the Messiah. The history of the
Passion and the death of Christ as given
ln the gospel of St. John was a prominent
feature of the morning service, the Pas
sion being chanted by three priests, one
representing the evangelist or writer (St.
John). the other Pilate and the
mob and the third Christ. After the
chanting of the Passion came the solemn
prayers for all conditions of people, Cath
olics, Protestants and Jews. The venera
tion of the cross, which is meant as an
act of reparation to Christ for the humili
ation and outrage he endured, followed.
The mass of the presanctified was then
celebrated. In the evening the services
Included the Way of the Cross, which
consists of following Christ in spirit
through the stages of his Passion, from
the garden of olives, where that Passion
began on Thursday evening, to the cross
at Calvary, where the Passion was con
summated. Another prominent feature of
the evening service was a special sermon
on the Passion by the Rev. Father Gerald
B. Hannlgan.
At St.. Ignatius Church the Adoration
of the Cross and the chanting of the Pas
sion were the main features of the morn
ing service. At noon the representation
of the three hours of agony began. The
seven words of the Lord were made the
subject of seven short discourses by
Father Chiappa. S. J. Aldega's "Orato
rio," composed expressly for this solemn
ceremony, was rendered. At 3 o'clock the
holy sepulcher was openeu to the view
of the congregation. In the evening the
"Way of the Cross was given. The regu
lar choir, augmented by the Ladies' So
dality, rendered Rossini's "Stabat Mater."
This was followed by a sermon on the
Passion by the Rev. Father Gleason. S. J.
The congregation was then admitted to
the Adoration of the Cross and the bene
diction with a relic of the true cross was
given from the altar.
In the morning at St. Mary's the mass
of the Presanctified and the Adoration of
the Cross were celebrated. In the even
ing, immediately after the services of the
Rosary, Rev. Father MacCorry delivered
an eloquent sermon on "The Three
Crosses." The preacher showed how the
right hand cross bore poison, the left
hand cross repentance and the middle
cross the harvest of transcendent love.
At Trinity Episcopal Church the ser
vices began with morning prayer at 8:30,
which was followed by the litany and a
three-hour service, lasting until noon.
Rev. Henry*! E. Cooke, rector of the
church, officiated and preached the ser
mon. In the evening Steiner's "Cruci
fixion" was rendered by an augmented
choir. Rev. Henry S. Hansen officiated.
The Rev; Dr. Nelander, pastor of the
First English Lutheran Church, on Geary
street between Gough and Octavla,
preached on "The Rending of the Veil."

Dubois', chant, "Virum Dolorum"; an
them, "To Jesus in His Passion," Austin;
anthem, "For Us the Christ Is Made a

mer. ..*.* *Â-:â¢â "
The services at Grace Episcopal Church
were unusually solemn. The vested choir
.was : gowned In black and chanted the
music without' the organ accompaniment.
All of the anthems and hymns were ap
propriate to the solemnity of the occasion.
Rev. Dr. R. C. Foute, the rector, preached
the sermon on "Our Lord's Crucifixion
and Death,": * â¢;':'

â¢T SAVED BY MRS. PINKHAM.*?
1.. I
[LÂ£TrS2 TO -IRS. PINKKAI. MO. 7*1,896]
"You have saved my life, snatched
me from the brink of the grave almost,
and I wish to thank you. About eigh-
teen months ago I was a total wreck,
physically. I had been troubled with
leucorrhoea for some time, but had given
hardly any attention to the trouble.
" At last inflammation of the womb
and ovaries resulted and then I suf-
fered agonies, had to give up my pro-
fession (musician and piano player),
was confined to my bed and life became
a terrible cross. My husband sum-
moned the best physicians, but their
benefit was but temporary at best. I
believe I should have contracted the
morphine habit under their care, if my
common sense had not intervened.
'* One day my husband noticed the ad-
vertisement of your remedies and im-
mediately bought me a full trial. Soon
the pain in my ovaries was gone. lam
now -.well, strong and robust, walk,
ride a wheel, and feel like a girl in her
teens. I would not be without Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound; it
is like water of life to me. I am very
gratefully and sincerely your well-
wisher, and I heartily recommend your
remedies. I hope some poor creature
may be helped to health by reading my
story."â Col. E. P. Elc__t_SDK*-T,

*~PHE pleasant method and beneficial effects of the well-known remedy, Syrup of Figs, manufactured
-**- by the California Fig Syrup Company,, illustrate the value of obtaining the liquid laxative principles
of plants known to be medicinally laxative and presenting them in the form most refreshing to the taste
and acceptable to the system. ââ¢ It is the one perfect strengthening,. laxative,' ' - {
CLEANSING THE SYSTEM EFFECTUALLY, DISPELLING ..
COLDS AND HEADACHES, PREVENTING FEVERS,
OVERCOMING HABITUAL CONSTIPATION PERMANENTLY.
Its perfect freedom from every objectionable quality and substance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, gently yet promptly, without weakening or irritating them, make it the ideal laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs are used, as they are pleasant to the taste, but Â° .
THE MEDICINAL QUALITIES ARE OBTAINED FROM SENNA AND OTHER AROMATIC PLANTS,
by a method known to the California Fig Syrup Company only. In order to get its beneficial effects, and
to avoid imitations, please remember the full name of the Company printed on the front of every package.
. Consumers of the choicest products of modern commerce purchase at about the same price that others
. bay for cheap and worthless imitations. To come : into universal. demand and to be everywhere; considered
(the best of its class, an article must be capable of satisfying the wants and tastes of the best informed
â¢purchasers. The California Fig Syrup Company having met with the highest' success in the manufacture
and sale of its excellent liquid laxative remedy, Syrup op Figs, it has become important to all to have a
knowledge of the Company and its product. The California Fig Syrup Company was organized more than
fifteen years ago, for the special purpose of manufacturing and selling a laxative remedy.which would be
more pleasant to the taste and more beneficial in effect than any other known. The great value of the
remedy, as a medicinal agent and of the Company's efforts, is attested by the sale of millions of bottles
annually, and by the high approval of most eminent' physicians. As the true and genuine remedy named
Syrup of Figs is manufactured by the California Fig Syrup Company only, the knowledge of that fact
will assist in avoiding the worthless imitations manufactured by other parties. â¢*-^ Â°*. '. 'â * . .'â¢./. .

EASTERN MARKETS.
* . BRADSTREET S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, March, Si.â Bradatreet'a finan
cial review to-morrow, will say: Expectations
of a more active and higher .money market
â  were verified; call loan's having touched 1- per
â  cent this week, while much of the borrowing
of money at the Stock Exchange has been at
-^â¢Jf 6 per..cenr.' These* tendencies, however, have
been no. obstacle to the development of a
* strongly., bullish . speculation In stocks, with
advances In different parts of : the list carry
ing prices' in some instances to the highest
levels vet reached. The leaders in this move
ment were the Vanderbilt stocks, together with
certain specialties and industrials, though other
portions of the market were more or less favor
ably -affected,.- .Signs of active manipulation by
large interests were abundant, but the fact
that the market had taken an upward course
and that leaders of -Wall street were quoted as
saying that fears' about money were needless,
' â JaSd a decided effect on the speculative publi
cation. Commission houses were large buyers
and the dally volume of transactions, swollen
"jas.lt was by the increased public participation,
was considerably over 1.000,000 shares on Mon
day and . the7two- succeeding 'lays. This evi
dently Involved the transfer of large holding
of stocks into the hands of marginal speculators
: and prepared the.market for a reaction. Money
â¢ naturally became harder as the end of the
: rrionth drew- near,-- and the fact that the stock
exchanges' are closed on Friday created a dis
position, to. wait; 7On Thursday morning money
rose to 12 per' cent. . while the .news of the
troubles at Samoa caused some temporary fears
of Interest * complications. The result was a
decline. 1 which in some stocks almost took the
form of breaks, though before the day ended
the leading manipulated stocks were rallied
sharply, and the close was generally steady at
a recovery. London has shown a disposition
to purchase* the ; Vanderbilt stocks and. other
specialties., but has not been a prominent, fac
tor in the speculation here. Our market has
disregarded the decided advance In foreign ex
change rates and attributes the rise < *' demand
sterling to preparations for the remittance of
the $20,000,000 which the United States treasury
is to. pay **â â  Spain for the surrender, of the
Philippines.. j 'As for the money market, the
prevalent Impression In Wall street has been
that firmer , "interest rates are temporary, and
*""-nÂ«>xt week will .be. marked by the return to
New York of the funds which, on the comple
tion of the' April disbursements, will no longer
he require-. -there.. Among the .Incidents which
contributed, to the* bullish feeling-was the fact
* that the February revenue statements of a
number of... Important railways,- while exhibit
ing decreases In- '.net earnings, fall to show
'â 'such heavy. -losses' as have been expected, and
on which' more of* less bearishnsss, principally
In connection, with- the ; granger stocks, had
..- been based- during. .the "preceding -fortnight. â¢'. .

- a prominent feature .In the- iron,- steel, machin
ery and "hilled trades. .In -some lines of manu
facturing. It is true, talk or. projected pos
.'Bible combinations' has made for some uncer
â¢ tainty Notable in this respect has been the
â¢ gloss trade. In which, however, plans for com
binations seemed to have ' temporarily failed
of accomplishment, Iron and steel are In less
active domain nt nearly all markets', but this,
ln some measure, appears to be 'a result of
scanty stocks or possible supplies offering and
not ro much of any curtailment of needs of
small consumers. Large consumers, with sup
7plies secured ahead, are rrported .waiting to
test the strength of the sellers*, position on
later deliveries. Pr:. of material are firm
with MOM further advances at the West ln
â¢ rails. Copper and lead show- some' return of
K.trenirth after the recent weakness. Lumber
demand. ' though Interfered with at retail.
shows all the. old strength of prices.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregate 3.995.23S bushels, against *â .
-746.761 bushels last week, 3.550,664 bushels In
the corresponding week of IS9B, 2,464.645 bushels
in* I**'.'": 1,693.927 bushels In ISP-h. and -J. 553.93.1
bushels in 1595. Since July I this season, the
exports of wheat aggregate IM,MO,m bushels,
against 150.067.552 bushels last year.
There' is some shrinkage ln the dry goods
demand at New York, but there Is " reported
a rather better outlook in woolen goods. Talk
of combinations ln the woolen manufacturing
trade has softened wool quota!! at Bos
ton: Philadelphia reports steel plates nearly
double the price when the- present movement
.-' began, and the . strength of quinine ls not
Toeing Impaired. ' Had weather is generally
complained of at the West as hurting distri
bution at retail, but St. Louis reports little
â apparent damage to winter wheat, and that
large orders for cars and railway equipment
generally are . being placed. Spring trade at
â ' Chicago ts the best since IS?!, and surpasses
that year -.â¢a many lines, tanners are prepar
ing inventories necessary to going Into the
â  new combination and iron and steel are still
active, though with less snap than heretofore.
On the Pacific Coast the â¢ improved tone ol
advices from California Is still the feature.
Southern advices are fairly cheerful. Wheat
. exports are reported liberal and the outlook
favors ivy future shipments from that port.
Iron Is firm at Birmingham, though there are
reports of immense future increases in. the
Southern fields' output. Bank clearings f> r the
week aggregate {-.M 1,227,000,, 227,000, a gain of les
than 1 per cent over last week, but of OS per
cent over last year, while they are double
those of 1594. 1896 and 1897, and the gain over
P92 Is 75 per cent.
Past reports of prosperous trade conditions
find confirmation In the smallest number of
failures, for the first quarter, reported for
seventeen years past, while liabilities are
lighter than for twelve years preceding. The
percentage of assets to liabilities, too. Is as
low as that reported In the most prosperous
years. The total number of failures for the
first quarter of 1899. as reported to Brad
street's, was 2779. 21 per cent smaller than last
year. 31 per cent less than ln 1897 and 13 per
cent smaller than in 1892. while liabilities ag
gregated $31,221,658, 13 per cent less than In
1898, 50 per cent less than in 1896 and 20 per
cent smaller than in 1892. Increases in fail
ures over a year ago were noted in New
England, due mainly to a large number of
embarrassments In Massachusetts, but the only
increase In liabilities In any group of States
is that noted in the Fur West.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK. March 31.â P.. G. Pun & Co.,
In their weekly review of trade, will say:
Failures during the first quarter of 1899 have
been In amount of liabilities not more than
about $26,650,330 t against $31,710,142 last year,
$48,007,910 In 1597 and $57,525,125 In 1896. While
the later returns may Increase the amount for
the quarter a little the complete returns, which
will be given next week, will be very remark
able In comparison with that of any previous
year. Business Is not at present improving,
there has been something like a check, partly
the result of heavy buying since January 1
to anticipate the market, partly caused by
the uncertainty about the operation of many
combinations and a shade of doubt about for
eign affairs also had seme influence. The new
rule of the clearing-house banks at New York
about taxation of country checks also causes
Home shifting of accounts. A period of tran
sition from one ownership to another and
from one management to another and from
one industrial system to another, Where it
affects many hundred establishments through
out the country. Inevitably causes some hesi
tation In business. A little later the many
hundred concerns may be doing more business
than ever, as they were Just before combina
tions were effected. Hut at the point of tran
sition nobody knows just what to expect.
There Is much withdrawal of Iron business be
cause continuance of high prices is doubted,
because the great purchases made by works
have not been met by orders and because works
affected by many other combinations proposed
are not Inclined to buy more largely.
Trices are strongly maintained at $15 15 for
Bessemer pig at Plttsburg, the valley asso
ciation having sold 130,000 tons for delivery in
the last half of the year at $14 50, and grey
forge Is stronger at $14 40, but hesitation ap- j
pears at Philadelphia about maintenance of
future prices. Chicago Is Inactive compared
with recent weeks. With no sales reported
except 10.000 tons at Chicago, rails are quoted
$1 higher there, and as much at Plitsburg.
and the sale of 150,000 tons steel billets to
the tin plate company sets prices for 100-pound
plate at J4 05 after July 1. structural demand
increases, but bar mills at the West and South
are consolidating and are not disposed to take
large contracts, although the Plttsburg mills
are/asking $1 50 because behind In their orders.
For the plates the demand far exceeds the
supply at Philadelphia and Chicago, and the
leading mills at Plttsburg are full until
August or later. In hoops. cotton ties. tubes
and other products expected consolidation af
fects business. Minor metals are stronger for
tin at M cents, with consuming demand, and
for copper at 17.60 c owing to London specula
tion. More evidence appears that the woolen
manufacture Is not helped as yet by new com
binations or the prospect of them, and the
buying demand has been disappointing In many
ways, though In dress good* active. Sales of
wool were 20.501.200 pounds at three chief mar
kets In four weeks, against 8.877,800 pounds
last year, when prices were held at the top,
65.556.200 In 1887, when prices were being
rushed upward, and 30.932.576 pounds In 1892,
when manufacture was normal, indicating a
fair but not extraordinary demand for good*;.
Prices are said to be quiet for Ohio XX. at
26 cents.
The boot and shoe business is again halting
because of differences between buyers and
sellers as to prices. â 
The fluctuations of the wheat market have
been large and tend on the whole toward
higher quotations. Exports at Atlantic ports,
flour Included, have been for four weeks 11.
-679.512 bushels, against 9.392.495 last year, and.
Pacific ports 1,963.687 bushels, against 2.774.112.
and th<Â» other exports, not given last year,
make the total 17,713,088 bushels. Western re
ceipts have been 12.94?, 5i.i bushels, â  against 9,
-96fi.373 last year. ' â¢â  '
; Railroad earnings for three weeks of March
have been 4.1 per .cent larger than last year
and 9.S per cent larger than In 1592, and the
east-bound tonnage from Chicago in four
Weeks has been 459,438 Tons, against 622,901 last
year and 356.365 In 1892, which Indicates quite
clearly the remarkable depression in rates a
year ago. : .
Failures for the week have been 149 in the
United States against 220 last year, and 2.6: in
Canada against 27 last year. â¢ :

CALIFORNIA RAISINS FIRMER.
NEW YORK, March 31.â The Journal of Com
merce says: The situation in California loose
Muscatel raisins OB the spot Is generally held
to be much firmer than it was a week or ten j
.lays ago. In the Interim seeders and jobbers
have bought quite freely of lower grades, partly
because the goods were needed for consump- j
tion, but particularly for the reason that It has 1
been generally .believed that notwithstanding
differences between growers and packers on
the coast they would ultimately come together
on a general plan, a result of which would
be to place prices for the coming crop on a
stable basis. As stocks here were compara
tively small and there was nothing coming for
ward from California on consignment or other
wise, â¢ seeders who have had use for a good
deal of stock have been dally In the market
for low grades, though as a rule they have
shown no disposition to anticipate requirements.
There has also been a good deal of buying: by
jobbers, It is reported, and most of the spot |
stock of two and three crowns not already pur
chased by seeders is understood to be now con
trolled by them. At the same time a prominent !
commission house is credited with having by â¢
purchases here and there succeeded in ob- |
taining practical control of the spot supply of
ungraded raisins. The present spot quotations
for loose raisins are considerably below parity
With prices on the coast, where according to
the last advices figures for present delivery f.
o. b. were 3**ic for two-crowns. 'V for three
crowns and 6**ic for four-crowns. in the In
terior markets prices are much higher than
here, according to late reports, but there seems
to be no demand from those markets for New
York stocks.

Harrison's circular says: ''During the week |
there have been four coal deliveries from
Washington, amounting to 9599 tons; four from '
British Columbia, 13,178 tons; one from Oregon, |
225 tons; two from Australia. 3417 tons: total.
26.419 tons. Stocks in yard are diminishing
gradually, notwithstanding all vessels suitable
for coal transportation are readily chartered
at current rates. The larger portion of our lo
cally owned ships, formerly in this trade, have i
found more profitable business carrying lum- !
ber to foreign ports, and it will be several
months before they will arrive back: In the in- !
terim the bulk of the coast trade is being done ;
by steamers. The mutations In the coal busi
ness have been numerous in 1898 and 1899: first
the Klondike rush of People and merchandise
gave employment to all the vessels (sail and
Steam) on the coast, then the war with Spain
took away all the steamers that were adapted
to the carriage of troops and fuel. These have j
disorganized somewhat our usual routine in
tire coal branch. -^BSSH
"In the past four weeks there have been
three calls from the Government for coal,
amounting to 11,500 tons, all going to Manila,
and there will probably be more needed in the
near future."

FREE FIGHT IN
A MEAT MARKET
J\ Milkman, Wife and Hired
Battle With Butefyers. 7
THERE was a lively time at 1 a meat
market on Market street, near Noe,
Thursday afternoon, in which two
butchers, a milkman and his wife and.
hired mail were the participants. In con
sequence there will be an airing In the
Police Courts as to the cause of the free
fight..' x'7'7: '.':",. "'.. ! '.'â â ' â¢'*
The statements of the opposing parties
are. conflicting. The complaining wit
nesses are Albert R. -bring nnd his
brother Charles, who own the meat mar
k?t. and the defendants are â¢ Charles
Evans, a milkman living at 12 Hartford
street, his wife and John Hickey, a hired
man. When swearing to the complaints
In Judge Megan's court yesterday charg
ing the three parties named with battery
the Steinbrings said that the defendants
came to their meat market Thursday aft
ernoon and Mrs. Evans began to abuse
Charles because she alleged that his wife
had been saying mean things about her.
Finally she sailed Into Charles and Al
bert went to his assistance. Evans and
the hired mah joined In the fray, and car
casses of sheep, legs of mutton and roasts
w beef were hurled at the two butchers.
/
matter had' been placed In the hands of
Captain. Spillane. : The latter was sum
moned to appear in the Chief's" office and
with a self-complacency- remarkable for
its indication of indifference to the wel
fare of the public he told of his masterly
inactivity.. . â (.-.â¢ "*:.-. 7. **..".-.':.- â¢ â¢
"No proceedings have been taken to
bring about the arrest, of the men who
are running the * phonograph parlors
named and described In The Call," he
said. "I intend, to- lot .the matter rest for
a few days and will then put an officer
on this special detail." . .X
Chief Lees supplemented this statement
by explaining that the reason for this
course was the belief that the. offenders
bad probably, withdrawn : the immoral
pictures, songs and dialogues from exhibi
tion and had concealed the evidence' of
their crimes. No reason was assigned,
however, for not swearing out search
warrants for the discovery, and seizure of
these collections of moral tilth- and cor
ruption. Lees made, the magnanimous
proposition during the interview that If
some one who had seen the exhibition in
question would swear to a complaint' and
procure a warrant for the arrest of an
offender he would see that the warrant
was promptly served.
Captain Bohen was found to be equally
averse to inconveniencing the proprietors
of the "phonograph, parlors." He de
clared It was necessary for strong sus
picion to exist against a person -before
the police would feel justified in swearing
out a search warrant to uncover the evi
dence of a crime, and his mind, he said,
was not imbued with any strong suspi
cion, despite the clear, plain statement of
facts, Including time, places and persona,
published in The Call. ...
Among the general public a feeling of
Intense indignation exists that such ex
hibitions should be allowed to flourish and
bring big profits to Peter Bacigalupi and
his ilk in the most public thoroughfare of
San Francisco without an attempt on the
part of the police to suppress the terrible
evil.
Mayor Phelan was unqualified in his
condemnation of the outrage.
â ".'lf -they have been exhibiting lewd pic
tures of that kind," he said, "the police
ought to have had knowledge of it and
should have made arrests. This 13 the
first time my attention has been called to
it. I will see that the traffic is suppressed
and if we have any evidence we will make
arrests and punish. the offenders."
All the "phonograph parlors" were run
ning yesterday, but the vicious pictures
were invisible and the obnoxious songs
and indecent dialogues were inaccessible.
The indications are that they will be kept
so until after the visitation of Captain
Spillane's specially detailed officer, when
the work of debauchery of young and old
at 5 cents per head will be resumed, un
less other agencies than the police au
thorities take a hand in the work of pro
tecting the people of San Francisco from
moral pollution.. â¢..'-';
"I visited Bacigalupl's place * ' at 1030
Market street. this afternoon, after read
ing the article in The Call," said Secre
tary Frank Kane of the Society for the
Prevention of Vice when seen _at
his residence In San Rafael last even
ing, "and an examination of all theklnet-.:
oscopes in his establishment soon showed
me there were a number bordering. on ob
scenity. I ordered them removed; Back
galupi making no remonstrance. â¢
"The great difficulty in. prosecuting
these men ls the Insufficiency of the law.
Many of thesa exhibitions are unmistak- â 
ably indecent and should be suppressed,
but indecency is not a sufficient ground
for taking action against them. -To come
within the statute they must be obscene.*
I have kept a close watch upon all- these
places and in the past have made a hum*-,
ber of arrests. Baclgalupl was among. the.
first. In 1894 he was conducting a place
lower down on Marke' street,' where pho T .
nographs were the attraction. He was
not prosecuted, however,* because the ar
resting officer left my employ before the
case came to trial. .-. .. â *'
"I have had men out in all directions.to
. day investigating the other places of the
kind. So far no Infractions of the law
have been reported, but I will continue
the work personally to-morrow. The
police authorities have also at different
times made ineffectual attempts to sup
press the worst features of these places.
! I make it a rule to follow in their path,
and have often detected obscene pictures
i which they have missed." '.'â¢:â¢ * \- ;
After the melee Was over each of the
bring- had a black eye and the meat
market looked as if it had been struck by
a cyclone. .7,7; 7.'.'
When Evans learned that warrants
were out he and his wife and hired man
surrendered themselves at the City
Prison, after consulting Attorney Dinkel-
Bpiel, who will represent them in the Po
lice Court. Their story differs from the
bring*-. Mrs. Evans said that for
seven years Mrs. Charles Stelnbrlng, who
lives at 15 Hartford street, had been say
ing mean things about her, and she could
stand It no longer. Accompanied by her
husband and Hickey. she went to the meat
market in a friendly way to ask that Mrs.
Stelnbrlng should desist from her slan
ders, and as soon as they got there the
Stelnbrlng- came out to the sidewalk
arm* with cleavers nnd meathooks.
They attacked Evans and threw him
down, and liiekey went to -his assistance
and pulled the Steinbrings away from
him. . That was really all that occurred.
Evans and the hired man corroborated
her. They were released on bail.
This morning warrants will be sworn
out against the Steinbrings for "battery,
and when the cases come up for hearing
a lively time Is expected, as both sides
are determined to show no quarter.

Governor Gage has distinctly announced
that all: the talk about the calling of an
extra â¢ session of the . Legislature, is non
sense, yet many, of -the machine politicians
fancy that he will * change his mind after
he has had several -prolonged interviews
with Colonel Burns. . The touts receive
the news; that Burns has. gone south with
the Governor as an item of cheering In
telligence. They smile at the. suggestion
that the colonel has gone to some south
ern canyon to examine a mine .and report
the -actual facts to Gage. They surmise
that the mine investigation story is only
a ruse to throw Senatorial aspirants other
than the colonel off their guard.
. It is known that Dibble and others who
were active 1 in -the Burns" campaign' for
the'. Senatorship have.-been Closely study
ing the law and. precedents regarding the
appointment of a: United States Senator
by the. Governor and that- Gage is to
have the benefit of. this wide research.
No little significance Is attached to the
recent failure of the. Legislature of Penn
sylvania", to convene a quorum. The re
port comes that the Governor of the Key
stone State will appoint Quay United
States Senator if the Legislature adjourns
sine die without ..reaching an agreement.
There has been- a general -sounding of
Senators to ascertain the. sentiment of
the Senate regarding admission of Sena
tors on gubernatorial appointment. The
machine politicians hope to convince Gov
i ernor. Gage that the Senate would admit
a Senator from California, appointed by
j the chief executive of the. State." The fact
may be cited that the Legislature, did not
take a ballot after the Governor, in a
special message urged that personal dif
ferences should be laid aside and a Sena
tor chosen. j On the last day of the ses
sion, twenty minutes_bef ore the time fixed
by the Federal statute for taking a ballot
for United States Senator, the Legislature
adjourned, sine die. No: doubt all these
Incidents: will be cited in the long., argu
ment to convince the Governor, that some
one should be appointed to .fill the. va
cancy caused, by the expiration of the
term of Stephen M. "White.*
: The departure of Burns for the south
In. company with the Governor causes a
running fire of comment in. commercial
and political circles. : The fact is recalled
that Burns played very close to Markham
âso, close that no one could get near the
Pasadena statesman without passing the
colonel on duty as a sentinel. Markham
was molded to suit the.' fancy of Burns,
but he did kick against the rough.hand
ling of the clay when "Mose" was put
up for Police Commissioner. : He yielded
at length to Dan's treatment of the case,
but retired to private life under a cloud.
One of the few leading Republicans of
Califoyda who advocated the election of
-Burns to the Senate was In. the city yes
terday,* and commented on. the apparent
Intimacy of : Gage and -Burns. In the
course ;of the -.comment he 7 remarked:
"Burns will find that Gage, is; not another
Markham. : Gage* will \ stand for a good
many things,- but if I size him up correct
ly he: will fix a limit and will stand for
nothing more. If Burns, tries, to force him
as he "forced Markham there will be a

STEPPED TO HIS DEATH
THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW
Hugh : Lynch Killed
//in the Rear of

; .Hotel.
HUGH LYNCH, a laborer, re
siding at the Cable Hotel on
Tiffany avenue, near Twenty-.*
eighth street,: stepped out of
the window of his room on the third ;
story some -time during Thursday
night. His dead body was. found In
the yard, sixty feet below, . early
yesterday morning by Peter Roe,
another lodger in the place: The
ribs on both sides had been crushed
and splintered by the fall and pieces
of the bone had entered both lungs,
causing death from internal hemor
rhage.. .*';â¢-â  >'.-;."
It .was suspected at first' that
Lynch might have *been thrown out
of the window, but the fact that he
fell so close to the house, and that
:in its descent his body had struck
and shattered two panes of glass in
the room of Matt : Conway on the
second story, 7 upset this theory.
Lynch, who was a man about 40
years old, was a hard drinker at
times. He had only been a lodger,
at the Cable House for three weeks
and it is supposed that,: arising dur
ing the night somewhat under the
Influence of liquor, he mistook the
window for the door, opened it and
stepped out to his death. No one

Representatives of Ingleside Coursing
Park appeared before' the Health and Po

recent ordinance prohibiting betting on
racing nbe so amended- as to ! permit of
pools being sold on the competition be

his associates on ; the committee listened
attentively to all that was said, but gave
the petitioners no hope of relief. Action
on the*' matter was deferred. .. â¢
| Domlnick Shannon, president of Ingle
side Coursing Club, was the first heard.
He. dwelt on the honorable position which
coursing had attained here and that "it
was essentially a. "poor, man's sport. He
told of the character of the people at
tracted to. the park and of the good order
maintained at all - times. . Coming down
to more material affairs, he said he and
his' associates had lnvesteu ' $12,000 in the
park recently and this would prove a total
loss if their ground were 'closed. There
would also be a marked depreciation in
the, value -of the hounds when fewer, op
portunities were presented for running
them. "-.-â  â -â '.â -'â â¢ . - . â
Captain Clarkson, who had charge of

SCTie Press and Prosecution Roundly
Denouncedâ Hall Will
Instnirj. the Jury Early
This Morning.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
DOS Broadway,* March 31. '
The closing scene of the famous Brandes
murder case to-day was extremely' dra
matic. The arguments were Anally con
cluded and to-morrow morning Judge Hall
will deliver his instructions to the jury.
It is expected a verdict will be agreed up
on in short order.
Attorney Sawyer for the defense occu
pied the jury's attention the entire morn
ing and most of this afternoon. In bits
closing argument he took: occasion to be
stow commendation upon the court for
â¢frequently cautioning the 1 jury to refrain
from reading newspaper accounts of the
trial. Sawyer upbraided the press vehe
mently and said the newspapers had long
ago Â« spoused the theory of "William A.
Brandes' guilt. The "men who' put the
pen to the paper" he: charged with "coming
Into court and putting their arms around
District Attorney ' Allen's . . neck with a
view of Influencing the jury"; and he also
scolded the scribes "for discrediting the
â story of "Milton. Brandes' son."
Then Attorney Sawyer picked up the
â¢folded apron with which he claimed Lil
lian had hanged herself and in which for
nearly two hours Attorney Bennett this
afternoon seemed* Intensely interested,
and'roared: . -.* Â°7 7...
. "The prosecution has said this apron is
too short for the girl to have hanged her-
eelf with. I offer to hang any of you jur
ors with it. Mr. Bennett, come here" I
(summoning his associate), And Attorney
Bennett responded. Sawyer, climbing Into
a chair, tied the noose about Bennett's
neck, and holding up the other end, shout
ed: "Here's a man with a big neck, and
there's plenty of rope. There! The possi
bility is there, and that possibility belongs
to the defendant. And the apron was
strong enough." â¢â â¢â¢.; ; â¢'â :
The unusual scene as Sawyer held bis
associate in the noose created a' stir In
the lobby and caused the row of women
seated inside the railing to almost rise to
their feet, when the sharp rapping of the
bailiff restored order. Attorney Sawyer
next defended Milton Brandes' story, and
said that the jury "would have to cut the
arms of the little boy from around his
father's neck and declare him a perjurer
before they can convict the father." He
read at length noted cases of circumstan
tial evidence where after the execution of
the condemned their Innocence was estab
lished, and declared that the prosecution
In the Brandes case had not proved mo
tive, wherefore he asked for an acquittal.
A five minutes' recess was hailed as a
relief even by the accused, who appeared
particularly "slicked up" to-day. His
beard had been neatly trimmed and the
tonsorial artist had removed his super
abundance of hair. v"<-/Â° â  â 
When District Attorney Allen arose -to
deliver the closing argument one could
hear Brandes' heavy breathing. Mr. Al
len's argument was brief. lie said he
realised that every one concerned was
tired, and. expressed surprise that the de
fense should have occupied nearly three
days to argue a case .which they claimed
had already fallen to the ground so far
as the State is concerned. He touched
solely upon the salient points and pointed
out the absurdity of Bennett's statement
that "Brand* a may have placed the apron
around his daughter's neck to cover the
crime of another."
"We ask for vengeance," said At
torney Allen. "We arc seeking no
victims. But the law must be up
held, and if you 'find 'in your deliberations
that this man murdered Lillian Brandes
we ask that your verdict be so rendered,
and we are confident you know your
duty.". :,.;.;{;' â ;,/ ' â  i -f> '{ : :; ; v ' 'â¢ "
The District Attorney's closing remarks
were greeted with applause from the
lobby, and women clapped their hands,
only to be suppressed by the court. When
order had been restored Judge Hall
pounded the jurors on the question of the
submission of the case going over, until
to-morrow, realizing their fatigue. Some
there were who held up their hands as
favorable to an immediate determination
of Brandes' fate. To the matter going
over till Monday the defense announced
It had no objections: but It was finally
decided that an adjournment be taken
until to-morrow morning at 9:30 o'clock,
when the jury will receive its instruc
tions.

Miss Durgess was* seen. this evening at
her home on San- Jose avenue. She
readily admitted having sent .the letter
mentioned to ,: Mr. ' Forderer, and said
she considered she was only doing her
duty in-calling his attention to what she
considers the immorality of his garden
ornaments. At first . she was not inclined
to discuss the matter at any length, pre-,
f erring to await Mr. Forderer's action op
her communication. - 7

lady, "but as a Christian woman I feel
It a duty . I owe to my neighbors and

on the subject of Miss Durgess' letter he
smiled, and pointing to his statuary said:
: "Look at those figures. Do they look

Justice â those towering figures do they
look as though they would shock the.
modesty of any one in his right mind? I
think this woman Durgess is a crank.
She cannot see more than the heads of
the statues from the street, as the lower
portions of them are hidden by shrubbery.
"Only an evil-minded person could pos

images; I believe this woman's head

THE directors of Ingleside have
given to. th.' public of this city a
series of, facts of almost terrifying
import. : These worthy gentlemen
have inadvertently told the peo
ple of tb'Â«* city what it costs San Fran
cisco in dollars and cents to license the
disgrace-producing, death-dealing game
of the race, course. The press and the
pulpit have the recital of bitter facts
shown what' it; costs this city in human
lives and in- the honor of men and
women sacrificed to maintain the In
gleside evil. The directors of the blight
ing institution; give now the com
panion . story .'to this, picture of crime
and show.. what a tremendous â¢ drain
upon" its '-.Vital;. .forces this city suffers

' It should not be understood that the
directors of ingleside .'are. telling the
whole truth, but upon the authority of
facts, and- figures, tabulated ' by their
own employes;, these directors confess
that nearly *X'> millions of Â dollars
have been sucked from tria city in the
last- four years.-,. if the truth were mid
the appalling - aggregate might perhaps
be twice as 1/i.rge, but as the' In
gleside manipulators give the figures
they record a fact which, merits the
most ' serious consideration by those
who seek the welfare of the city. . â 
In their statement of disbursements
the mar.ape.rs of -Ingleside show that in
the last; four, years the Inglelde." track
has raid out.- $1,736,176 92. Where this
money came from, where has it -gone
and what has - San - Francisco to show
for lis enormous-e xpenditure are In-
qulries which are answered. by tragic
facts. The money which has made In
gleside the manipulator of millions of
dollars in the last four years-came from
the people of this city. It was. stolen
by dishonest clerks, thieving cashiers,
embezzling public officials. .It was con-,
tributed by poor men and women, fired
by the contaminating touch of gam
blers and inspired to hazard and lose.
their earnings and then . their, hard
won store of savings. : From . laborers, .
artisans, merchants, men and ; women'

dollar of it, from the people of this city.
The' Corrigans, the Ullmans, the book
makers and gamblers did not give it..
They came here to 'make money, not'
to give it. They came to set their traps,
for honest and dishonest men alike, and
then with their easily won bank rolls
return to spend their winnings in East- 5
crn communities. The people of San.
Francisco have supplied. the $1,736,176 92
and more which the masters of .'lngle
side have expended, and it will be easy
to show - , just how .the enormous "sum'
was sucked out of the community, and
why none of it has-been returned to
its source. The facts themselves, ' in
their simplest presentation, will prove
that the millions which have' gone into.
Ingleside have been drawn : from pro
ductive channels into an entirely un- .
productive field and have thence, been
sent to other communities. The city is
being drained of its very "substance by
the racecourse.- ; -v Â° '.. =â " \Â° â  â  â¢'..â '-â¢
.-' The greatest revenue, of the track
is derived from the bookmakers, who
pay a daily tariff for the privilege of
gambling. At Ingleside' every book
maker pays a license of $20 for every
race upon .which he makes a book.
There are on an average six races a
day and one hundred racing days in
the Ingleside racing season. At least
eighteen bookmakers gamble every
racing day. These facts and figures
are easily computed and they show
that in four years the Ingleside Asso
i ciation has received from the. book-
makers the enormous sum of $864,
-000.
The bookmakers of Ingleside are
not in the business for their health.
They exist because they win money,
not because they lose it. It is hardly
credible for one to claim that the
bookmakers paid this sum to the In
gleside association. They never paid
a dollar of it.. The people of San Fran
cisco were bled fo* it and. then the di
rectors of Ingleside boast that they
gave in purses and stakes in four
years the sum of $886,860 75. The
deluded victims of the track, through
their agents, the. -bookmakers, paid
for these purses and stakes.
Nor is. this t;he whole story' of. what
the people of : this city pay for the
dreadful luxury of^ having Jnglesido
and its bookmakers. These . gamblers
must not only pay big tribute to the as
sociation, but each must employ on an
average of five men each a\t a daily sal
" ary of $10. This* has meant in four rac
king seasons at. Ingleside a" gigantic sal
ar^ roll of $360,000 to the. bookmakers.
. . ;lt is clear, therefore, that the pub
lic of San Francisco has in four years
paid to the bookmakers alone $1,224,
000 as a bonus for the privilege of
gambling. As a matter of necessity,
this tremendous sum had. to be paid
to the bookmakers before the public
could win a dollar. And of this sum
$864,000 has gone into the greedy
clutches of the managers of the race
course. The price has been paid not
only in gold but in the blood and hon
or of once decent men and women and
the wreck of homes.
But the story of Ingleside's income
and' ; its source has not yet .been told.
Tribute is laid. upon all who enter the
pates of the track. Every visitor pays
his. or her dollar for -admission. The
boys that do the gambling for the wo
men in â¢ the stand pay' - J? 50 a day for
the privilege. Â° From each. â¢of "these
young fellows, who receive at the track
a training in vice and "dishonesty, : the
managers of Inglosfde* extract a* daily
tribute of. this- sum. The privileges of
the bar and restaurant, â¢ tho right to :
shoe horses and sell feed,, the "privilege
â¢of .selling score cards, the poor boon of
selling candles and ' fruits, all are heav
ily ' taxed ; by the giant monopoly of

corruption. Every" poolroom in the
State and in the United States pays a
daily tariff of $10. From every possible
source the money flows into the coffers
of the course. Of the. millions- thus re
ceived the public has; no -account from
the; directors of Ingleside. 0 . These gen
tlemen tell only what they have done
with part of their .' enormous income.
What they have -done with the re
mainder is their secret and the city's
sorrow. 'â¢ . \ â â¢ "' Â° â¢'â  . ,' -V///-'
The directors, however, are entitled
.to. the hearing they. have demanded.
They report, that in four years they
have "expended $166,861 93 in salaries.-
This money has been disbursed to men
imported from Eastern States, such as
judges, handicappers, starters and the
track employes. They have been paid
with money robbed 0 from public and
: private treasuries, filched from local
houses of business and drawn from the
hard, earnings of poor men and women.
In order that Ingleside might pay its
imported employes $166,000 some men
are in San Quentin, others are in a the
graves of suicides, the torch" has been
applied to homes and familes know the
secret sorrow of disgrace. . o V. -
= And the directors of Ingleside boast
that $886,860 75 have been paid in stakes
and purse*. It has been shown that the
people of San Francisco, paid almost,
this sum alone to the association
through Â»â the bookmakers/ And the
purses and the stakes in most instances
went to Eastern horse owners. The
Breeder and Sportsman, 0 the official or
gan and defender of California ' horse-,
men and breeders, has voiced a solemn
protest against * Ingleside and '. has
shown that California breeders have
suffered and not c gained .from the ex
istence of Ingleside. The "skate" arid
not the stake horse has- had the favor
and the encouragement of the track
gamblers. The breeder has bowed to
the gambler, and when the "directors of
Ingleside seek to show that they have
contributed to the breeding of thor
oughbreds in this State they assert that
-which every California breeder of thor
oughbreds denounces as untrue. Â°J-.:'-'f'.
The financial statment- of Ingleside
shows also that $123,000 has be-m ex
pended for . meeting expenses This
means J that extra labor was .employed,
that private detectives were pressed
into service to : protect the -.. gamblers
from each" other and occasionally . the
public from them all. The legitimate
industries of this city received none of
this money, 'and with the reference to;
it the" managers of Ingleside have tabu
lated their- last' "great expenditure.
Among the : others, however, there is
one that merits special reference. . ' t
â  It is the total of ' gifts, made . by.- the.
association in four, years to charitable
institutions. ' The total is -.$7975/ an, av- .
erage of r $199.3 ,75.a year. Out of the
millions that ingleside has "absorbed
from this city this, miserable return* has
been o made to the institutions which
the .racetrack 'helps to "make public
necessities. And' these contributions
may well be called, -blood money. Char
ity has received from the gamblers this
small relief because the lives of. San
.Franciscans have been sacrificed;, be
cause honor .and reputations have been
lost. Ingleside has-been charitable In
the blood of a Norton, the dishonor of
aWidber,. the disgrace of a McGlade.
The . gamblers of Ingleside have opened
their greedy: palms and convict stripes
upon young men .tell why.
The o directors of Ingleside plead fur
ther in their own cause. They declare
that' they have put money in circula
tion, and unfortunately they tell the
truth. They circulate .the. earnings of
'men and women 0 who listen to the se
ductive "tips'" of 0 the gamblers and in
the service E they render the hotels re
ceive the snare into which they drop
and lose. their earnings. 0 The servants;
of the hotels Â°in which the Ingl* side
rout of- gamblers reside during their
campaign o ln this city can tell bitterly:
whose money is circulated. The money
of the track Is circulated in saloons and
disreputable resorts. It is circulated to
incite disorder and deeds of violence, to
debauch. -women and disgrace men.
Money that, should be in publio^
treasuries has been circulated by In-fB,
gleside. 6 The grave of a Norton speaks
eloquently of some of the money '.'
which Ingleside has set in circula- '
tion.- The flight of a Welburn tells of '
more that the racecourse set in circu- Â°
lation, The degradation and humilia- .
tion of a Neall is a lesson more elo
quent than the pleading of Ingleside's
directory to tell how money has been
circulated in San Francisco. The
dreadful story of Botkin, the deso
lated home in Delaware, and "the ,
crime-laden household in this city are
facts far more significant to illustrate '
the power of the" track to circulate : 0
money than Ingleside's facts and fig- â 
ures. o , â¢ .-.."'.
â â¢ âAnd this is the plea which the direc- -'
tors"; of Ingleside make ! for .exist- '
ence in this city. . These men who add.
nothing to the wealth- of the city, who â¢
produce-nothing but the "seeds of.crime.
who' contribute nothing but the' fruits 'â¢'
of vice, ask for municipal toleration ,'
and public patronage." They tell them-/
selves the story of their own '-. unpro- *
ductive burden upon the city and then -
ask -the right to continue to live at the â 
expense of everything worthy of ex- :
istence. These gamblers have told in
their own words and in their : own way
the appalling "truth that the- people of
this ' city â  have â¢ built . the racecourse, â¢
made wealthy its -manipulators 'arid'
.brought upon the city in retribution -** v
visitation of disgrace and â  death. This '
ih outline -is the meaning of the finan
cial statement of the disbursement*: â¢
which the directors of; Ingleside have
made, to the public of San Francisco.
