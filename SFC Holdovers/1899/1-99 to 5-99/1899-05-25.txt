SCHLEY ON FUTURE
NAVAL CONSTRUCTION
OMAHA, Ne-br., May 24.â Rear Ad
miral Schley left for Denver this after
noon, followed by the cheers of a great
multitude. When asked for an expros-
BIOD as to the probable result of the
war touching naval construction of the
future, he said:
"It is hard to say as to that. Various
nations may interpret it differently.
It will probably result in entirely dis
carding wood as construction material,
unless in connection with upper decks.
As !â  vessel that will be
given preference, that is to be deter
mined."
"And hoy about gur.s? Will big
one retain their popularity?"
"Well, results seem to show the best
work from 8-inch guns and those
smaller. I believe there is no record of
a U-ineh projectile striking, and but
two of the 12- inch. The 8 inch guns did
splendid work, and those of smaller
bore as well."
"Magazines have not yet printed
your story of the campaign?"
"No; I have not. written anything
and have declined all requests for con
structions of literary kind. I do not be
lieve that^hose who have a history or
assist in making history should write
it. Their field of vision if necessarily
limited, and they view it quit.' differ
ently from on>; who might obliquely spp
the entire situation. Then, again, there
are personal interests that should be
eliminated, and simple facts yhmild be
handed down to subsequent genera
tions. It is facts that the people want,
and when facts are in their possession
they do not have to go to Normal
Bchools to AedUCC conclusions."

NICARAGUA AND THE
BLUEFIELDS INDIANS
Red Men Refuse to Sig-n Away Their
Rights to the Zelaya Gov
ernment.
NEW YORK. May 24â A New Orleans ;
special to the Herald says: The steam
ship Condor, which sailed from Bluefields j
on May 17, left the Nlcaraguan gunboat
San Jacinto in Bluefields harbor, that
vessel having just returned from a trip '
to The Mosquito reservation. The San
Jacinto went there under orders from
General Torres, who is trying to cajole
the Indians of theÂ« reservation into sign
ing a new treaty which virtually would
deprive them of all their present rights.
This is a part of President Zelaya's plan
to do away with all semblance of auton
omy in the Coast Department and thus
enable him to get all the revenues from
customs.
Heretofore the coast has had a separate
tariff schedule, and was supposed to
sj end the moneys collected for schools.
Improvements and so forth. It was the
mission of the San Jacinto to take hm-k to
Blueflelda the Indians who would support
an annexation movement doing away with
the Coast Department.
The gunboat returned with thirty-five
Indians, btit in her wake were small boats
bearing the wittas, or head mm of the
nation, whose presence hud a deterrent
effect, none of the Indians agreeing to
Torus' scheme. There is now :m edict
prohibiting the sale of powder and shot
tv Indians. One of the wlttas said, how
ever, that they stand ready to tight for
their rights.
It may lie that the conditions existing
when the Condor sailed ripened into an
open conflict, in which the San Jacinto
would naturally have played, an import
ant jitirt. Should this surmise prove'cor
i rect the origin of the rumor prevailing in
tliis country aDout the conflict between
the Detroit and the San Jacinto would be
explained.
FRUITLESS ATTEMPTS
TO SAVE THE PARIS
Stranded Steamer Remains on the
Rocks, and a Supreme Effort Will
Be Made to Free Her.
rOVERACK. Cornwall. May 24. 5 p. m â
The attempt just made to float the Ameri
can line steamer Parts has proved unsuc
cessful.
The scene in the vicinity of the Paris
was interesting and animated for an hour
before high water. The American steamer
and her tugs put on a full head of steam
and exerted their utmost power to refloat
her. These efforts continued fruitless for
two hours, and it waa finally decided to
defer the attempt to float her until a
later tide, probably on Friday.
The American line officials are still most
hopeful, but the experts are divided in
Opinion. Vice Admiral Sir Compton E.
Dorntville, superintendent of the Naval
Reserves, arrived this afternoon on board
the coastguard tender Hawk. He visited
the Paris and remained on hoard through
out the efforts made to float her.
The American liner St. Paul exchanged
salutes witli tire Paris as she passed up
the channel to-day for Southampton.
\'E\V YORK. May 24.- Vice President
w'right of the American line said to-day
that he had received a cablegram from
Henry Wilding, the iippnt of the line at
Southampton, in which he said the su
preme attempt to get the Paris off the
; rocks will be made Saturday. By that
time all the pumping apparatus will have
arrived at the steamer and the work will
have been started. Officials of the line
are still confident of saving the steamer.

WILL NOT TAKE
THE MONEY

to Accept the Terms of
Uncle Sam.
OTHERS DISGRUNTLED
Members of the Late Military As
â semblyJoin in Advice to Insur-
I gents Not to Give Up Arms.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, May 24.â General Maximo
Gomez has received a telegram from
General Sanchez, In Santiago Province,
saying: 'â¢Division will not accept
money."
He has replied: "Will use every ef
fort compatible with dignity and
honor."
The Havana papers consider this
answer evasive, and the Cubans gen
erally, especially those belonging to
the fighting divisions, whirh are chiefly
Westerners, say that most of the sol
diers will accept the money, as $75
apiece is better than nothing. Proba
bly thero will be a large attendance
on the first payment, as well as upon
those that follow. A member of the
staff of Gomez said to-day that not
more than 20 per cent would refuse
when the' money was actuary in sight.
The Sangulllys, Lacret, V â 'â¢i', Mayia,
Rodriguez and all the late members of
the Cuban Military Assembly. aided
by the opposition newspapers, are ad
vising the Cuban soldiers not to give
up their arms â not to sell the souvenirs
of the struggle for liberty, and not "to
part with honor for $i"5."
It is pointed out that e'-^n Gomez.
In his proclamation, counseled the
soldiers to go home with or without
money.
General Brooke, of course, will pro
ceed with his programme without heed
ing the opposition.
The military inquirers into the mat
ter have lost all confidence in the 'â¢oils
prepared by the Cuban Military Assem
bly. Hence, if 15,000 or 20.000 men ap
pear for payment, the expectations of
the Americans will be satisfied, but the
dissidents will assert that as 39,930 men
were enrolled any number less than
that appearing for payment will repre
sent armed Cubans who reject the
American conditions. In any event a
large percentage of the $3,000,000 will
not be disbursed.
CHOLERA RAGES AT
INDIA'S CHIEF SEAPORT
BOMBAY, May 25.â Cholera is raging in
Karachi, the principal seaport town of
Singe. Two hundred and thirty-two new
cases were officially reported yesterday
and 208 deaths for the day.
The official returns show a total of 1197
cases and of 1099 deaths since the begin
ning of the outbreak.
Karachi, or Kurrachoo, is on an inlet
of the Indian Ocean, eighteen miles from
the west branch of the Indus. The town
was taken by the Hrltlsh in 1839, and was
retained as a military post. According to
the census of 1891. its population is about
100.000. A railway extends from Karachi
to Hyderabad. Of late years the town
has been rebuilt and greatly Improved,
and It Ib now one of the chief seaports
of India.

NEW YOBK, May 24.â A cable
to the Sun from Paris sa'-s: It
is understood that the report of M.
Ballot de Beupre, president of the
civil division of the Court of Cassa
tion, on the Dreyfus revision pro
ceedings, states that the demand for
revision has oeen fully made out,
adding, however, that if the quashing
of Dreyfus' conviction had been de

granted.
PARIS, May 24.â The president of the
civil section of the Court of Cassation,
M. Ballot de Beupre, to-day submitted
to the President of the Court of Cassa
tion, M. Mazeau. the findings in the re
vision of the trial of Alfred Dreyfus.
The Figaro, continuing: its analysis
and publication of the evidence offered
in and bearing upon the proceedings
before the Court of Cassation, gives
the minutes of the investigation by
Oeneral Rrnouard into the conduct of
Lieutenant Colonel Dv Paty de Clam
on September 9, 1898.
The latter's examination confirms
the main points of Esterhazy's various
revelations. He denies that he wrote
or dictated the letters which Esterhazy
sent to M. Faure. He also denies that
he or any member of the general staff
wrote or dictated the "dixi" article, but
he admits that he corrected some of the
sentences.
The "veiled lady" was. he asserts, his
wife, whom he used as an intermediary
when forbidden to- see Esterhazy. He
admits that he did not have explicit
; orders, but says he believed he was

did by the late Lieutenant Colonel

Cifinzp and General de Boisdrffre were

General Renouard reported, accord
ing to the Figaro, that Dv Paty de

which should be punished severely and
advised his retirement. This sugges

First Shipment From the
Lower California
Klondike.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX DIEGO, May 24.â A correspond
ent at Ensenada to-day telegraphed
'â  that the first consignment of gold dust
and nuKKets from the Cerro Pinto plac
j ers, which was sent on the steamer Cv
i racao to Guaymas merchants on her
last triii south, amounted to $158,000.
The news of this large shipment was
] kept very quiet by the persons interest
ed until they could get their men off
to the fields, and it has only Just leaked
out, causing excitement at Ensenada
; never before equaled. All the old
miners declare that a new Klondike
has been found.
Captain Martinez has pone to the
Cerro Pinto mines with twenty-five ru
rales to preserve order. Over fifty pas
sengers left Ensenada this afternoon
on the steamer Carlos Pacheco for
Asuncion Bay, the point of debarkation
for the mines. Every berth was occu
pied and many who wanted to go
could not pet accommodations.
A returning miner who has Just
reached Ensenada says that the plac
ers are twenty-eight miles long by fif
teen miles wide and the pay dirt runs
from two to six feet deep. The miners
are all making big money with their
crude washers. Water has to be
brought about twelve miles, and until
recently was sold by the water carriers
at $5 (Mexican money) a bucket. It Is
now down to $2 50 a bucket, and a
number of men are digging wells with
the hope of getting a supply near the
placers.
There are over 600 men at the mines
or on the road thither. There !s a
gr^at scarcity of pack animals, as
horsen cannot be used, owing to lack
of proper food. The placers are in a
barren, rlreary locality.
It transphes that the placers are not
so new BS was at first thought when
the excitement broke out a few days

city, received letters from G. Antonio

BRITONS CELEBRATE
VICTORIA'S BIRTHDAY
CONFERENCE
OF DEMOCRATS
TO BE HELD
Leaders Rally at St. Louis
to Arrange for Presi
dential Campaign.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. LOUIS, May 24.â Ways, means
and methods of conducting the next
Presidential campaign will be consid
ered by the Democratic conference at
the Planters' Hotel to-morrow. It is
not thought that much other matter
will r-ome before the meeting, and no
definite action of any sort will be ta
ken until a majority of the members of
the committee is present, and whether
a sufficient number will be in attend
ance is problematical.
Ex-Governor Stone of Missouri, who
issued the call for the meeting, has re
ceived twenty-eight favorable replies.
Two of these have been withdrawn and
proxies forwarded. This leaves but
twenty-six members of the committee
as an outside number to be present at
the meeting, and the Democratic lead
ers are not over sanguine to-night that
they will have this number, or even
twenty-three, which would constitute a
working majority of the committee.
If a quorum is secured, it is altogeth
er likely, according to Committeeman
Gahan of Illinois, that the meeting will
be resolved, into a formal session of the
national committee and some definite
action taken. Otherwise -re will be
nothing but an informal conference re
garding the best methods of r " -ting
the campaign. Only three committee
men are in the city to-night. Woodson
of Kentucky. Gahan of Illinois and
Stone of Missouri.
It Is generally understood that "anti
trust" will be the rallying cry for the
Democracy, with â¢'anti-imperialism" a
close second and "16 to 1" not entirely
discarded, but kept in third place. As
one of the leaders of the party ex
pressed it, "anti-trust" and "anti-im
perialism" will be the salt and pepper
with which we will flavor "16 to 1."
There have been countless rumors
floating around to the effect that silver
is to be entirely discarded and that, as
far as Missouri is concerned, Bryan, is
to be shelved in favor of William J.
Stone of Missouri. This Mr. Stone
positively denied to-day, saying that
he would go into the next convention to
work for Bryan, and that the Missouri
delegation would vote solidly for Mr.
Bryan's nomination.
Committeeman Gahan was closeted
for three hours to-day with Mr. Stone,
urging the claims of the Harrison fac

tion in Illinois as against that headed)
by ex-Governor Altgeld.
The Harrison men deeply resent the j
action of the Democratic National j
Committee in the indorsement it gave |
Altgeld in the Mayoralty campaign in I
Chicago this spring, and was very stiff
in urging that Altgeld be removed from
the advisory committee of the National j
Committee, as he did. not represent the
regular Democratic organization, which
the Harrison men assert themselves to
be. They did not succeed in obtaining
what they desired, and Mr. Altgeld will
probably remain a member of the ad
viscry committee, but they were made
complacent by assurances that the
power and influence of Altgeld as a
member of the advisory committee will
be greatly curtailed.
Similar assurances were also re
ceived concerning Editor P. J. Devlin
of the Democratic National Press Bu
reau, who circulated the indorsement
of Altgeld, to which the Harrison men
object. The Harrison faction, after re
ceiving assurances that the Altgeld
power will be restrained, lessened their
light against him. but there is to be no
let-up regarding Devlin, and the Illi
nois men are out after his scalp. They
prefer it blood raw. Devlin is not
alarmed, and declares that as he is the
personal appointee of Chairman Jones,
nobody but that gentleman can remove
him. He says he will hang on despite
the efforts of the Illinois men.
If the conference should be resolved
into, a form of a national committee
to-morrow, it is probable that the res
ignation of Messrs. Teller and Allen
from the ways and means committee
will be accepted. Both are willing to
get out and the other members of the
national committee are willing they
should.
It is also reported that Chairman
Jones of the national committee will
resign, but this is not confirmed. It is
known that Senator Jones is a sick ma.a
and his illness is of a nature that may
prevent his taking an active part in the
management of a Presidential cam
paign.
The "anti-trust" banquet to-morrow
night promises to be a most successful
affair. All available seats have been
sold and an overflow meeting has been
arranged for. The toasts will be as fol
lows: "Why We Are Here," Hon. Har
ry B. Hawes; "Presentation of State
and District Banners in the Name of
the State Committee," Hon. Champ
Clark: "Acceptance of State Banner,"
Hon. C. B. Faris; "Acceptance of Dis
trict Banners," Hon. M. F. Benton;
"Trusts and Democracy," M. C. Wet
more; "The Trust and Its Parents,"
Hon. D. A. DeArmond; "Monopolies,"
Hon. William J. Bryan.
It is expected that short talks will be
made by other distinguished Dem
ocrats.

Their Sovereign.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, May 24.â Torrents of
rain ushered in Queen Victoria's
eightieth birthday to-day. Wind
sor, where a general holiday is
being observed, was decorated with
flags and the church bells were rung
at 11 o'clock in the morning. The
weather cleared about li o'clock abd
a serenade by the Windsor and Eton
Am.it.cur Choral Societies was given
in the grand quadrangle of Windsor
Castle. The sun then shonÂ° brilliant
ly. The serenade was listened to by
the Queen and members of the Royal
family.
Sir Walter Parratt, the master of the
Queen's music, and private organist
to the Q^ieen, wearing his official robes,
conducted the serenade from the steps
of the Queen's private entrance to the
palace, just below the Oak room,
where the Queen was breakfasting. The
Eton College volunteer cadets marched
into the castle grounds, headed by a
band of music and took up a position
in the rear of the choir. Behind the
cadets were drawn up the rest of the
Eton boys and the Military Knights of
Windsor. The Mayor and Corporation
of Windsor, in their full robes of office,
and the borough Magistrates were also
present.
The scene was picturesque. They ail
sang the National anthi-m and then
the choir gave the programme, com
prising the late Bishop of Waketield's
jubilee hymn, a four-part song, and
two specially written madrigals "To
the Queen." Finally the Eton boys
gave three lusty cheers in honor of Her
Majesty, and the Duke of Connaught
came to one of the windows and
thanked those present in behalf of the
Queen, who herself, looking to be in
excellent health, came forward and
bowed repeatedly.
During the afternoon the Queen
planted an oak sapling on the east lawn
of Windsor Castle. She drove along
Kenneth Drive to the spot and was
assisted in the planting by the Duke
of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. All the
members of the royal family witnessed
the ceremony. Her Majesty then con
tinued her drive in the direction of
Frogmore.
The Military Knights of Windsor pre
sented an address to the Oueen at n*~ â â¢
in the corridor of the castle, and re
ceived the warm thanks of Her Ma
jesty.
A pretty incident was the presenta
tion to the Queen this morning by each
of her grand and great-grandchildren
now at the castle of a tiny bouquet of2
flowers. These descendants of Her
Majesty, who was deeply touched, also
kissed her.
Her Majesty also attended the birth
day service held at the Chapel Royal,
St. James Palace.
A great congregation assembled in
St. Paul's Cathedral this morning,
where thanksgiving services were held
and huge crowds, unable to obtain ad
mittance, grouped themselves in the
spaces about the building.
The Lord Mayor of London, Sir John
Vere Moore, the Sheriffs, the Aldermen,
sword and mace-bearers and all tne
other functionaries, In their robes of
state, attended. The Archbishop of
Canterbury, the Most Rev. Frederick
Temple, D.D., officiated and preached
the sermon, after which a te deum was
sung.
Birthday celebrations occurred
throughout the provinces. The ships
in the different ports were "dressed"
for the occasion, and the warships
were covered with bunting. At Ports
mouth there were reviews of the reg
ular troops, volunteers and naval bri
gades, and the same ceremonies oc
curred at the various arsenals and
garrison towns.
A telegram from Simla, the Bummer
capital of British India, records that
impressive Queen's birthday services
there were attended by the Viceroy of
India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston. and
the Indian and military officials in full
dress. Royal salutes were fired. Lord
and Lady Curzon held a state dinner
and levee at night.
Dispatches from the Continent report
the printing of eulogistic articles on
the Queen's reign in the European
press.
Joseph H. Choate, the United States
Bmbassador, telegraphed his congrat
ulations to the Queen, and Her Majes
ty sent a gracious reply.
The birthday banquet given at the
Hotel Cecil to-night was attended by
many members of the American So
ciety in London. -Lord Rosebery,
who presided, referred to the Ameri
can guests as "representing a great
commonwealth of States once a part
of the British empire, but now nearer
than any other country except the col
onies."
Colonel Taylor, of the societ-" in re
sponse, paid a tribute to the Oueen and
read cablegrams that had been ex- ;
changed with the citizens of Tampa, ;
Fla. His speech brought out a further â 
response from Lord Rosebery, after
which the orchestra played "Hail Co
lumbia," amid a lively demonstration.
Banquets and receptions were given j
by the British Embaspadors and Min
isters at all the leading capitals in Eu
rope in honor of the day.
An interesting feature of the celebra- i
tion here was the attendance of the
boys Of the naval and military schools
at a matinee given by Mr. Herbert \
Beerbohm Tree's company at Her Ma
jesty's theater, where the entire au- !
dience sang the national anthem, to
which the Queen listened by electro- ;

GREATEST DAY IN THE
HISTORY OF PORT TAMPA
PORT TAMPA, Fla., MÂ»v "i -ThÂ»
greatest day in tne history of Port '
Tampa, that of the celebration of
Qu^n Victoria's eightieth birthday, |
opened bright and warm. At sunrise, i
salutes were fired from the British and i
American war vessels lying in the har- i
bor. The shipping in the harbor was
gay with its dressings of flaps and pen
nants and throughout the town was a
liberal display of Hags, bunting and
Qoral decorations. British and Ameri
can flags were floated from every point
of vantage, and among them were
many Gorman flags. The most strik
ing feature of the decorations was a
triumphal arch displaying the British
lion and the American eagle.
Two hundred marines from the In
trepid and Pearl, the two British cruis
ers sent to take part in the celebration,
arrived at 8 o'clock in the morning and
were escorted up the dock by the Port
Tampa division Of the Florida Naval
Reserves, the Englishmen playing the
American national air and the Ameri
cans responding with the British an
them.' Arms were presented as they
passf-d through the arch, the shipping
in the harbor rent the air with its
steam whistles and goners, and the
spectators cheered themselves hoarse.
The most dramatic in< ident of the
day was the unveiling of a large por
trait of Queen Victoria. Th^ portrait,
draped in the flags of the two coun
tries, stood upon a small balcony of the
inn and before it stood a crowd of ex
pectant watchers.
At noon precisely in the capital of
Albany, N. V.. Governor Roosevelt
touched an electric button, the cover
ing fell from th^ face and two ma
rines. English and American, standing
on either side of the portrait, clasped
each other's hands in token of the
amity of the two great nations. The
people cheered wildly and off in the
harbor were heard the heavy guns of
the warships firing the Queen's salute.

Love and reverence for the Queen are
not confined to her empire, wide as are
its frontiers. Most deeply are these In
fluences felt by that great "common
wealth of states" referred to last even
ing by Lord Rosebery as closer now than
since the separation, and it must be
among the deepest satisfactions of her
old age to see the unhappy feelings evoked
by that separation disappear at last in
that sense of Anglo-Saxon brotherhood
and presage of An?lo-Saxon destiny to
which Colonel Taylor of the American So
ciety in London gave eloquent utterance
and which President McKlnley has ex
pressed as the regard and affection which
the American people cherish toward our
Queen.

ENTHUSIASTIC REUNION
AT THE MERCHANTS' CLUB
The Merchants' Club was the scene last
night uf an enthusiastic reunion of about
a hundred British-born residents of Sun
Francisco, the occasion being the Brit
ish Benevolent Society's annual dinner in
celebration of the birthdny of Queen Vic
toria. Her Britannic Majesty's Consul
General. William Clayton Plckersglil,
presided, and William Doxey acted as
toastir.aster. After the menu had been
disposed of the Consul General proposed
the toast of the evening. "The Queen."
He alluded to t.ie jubilee processions and
festivities in London, and remarked how,
in the midst of all the splendor and mag
nificence, the most impressive figure was
that of an old lady, simply attired, that
attracted all eyes and won all hearts. He
commented on her long and glorious
rÂ«-ifrn. and expressed the fervent hope
that the gracious lady's life may long be
spared.
"God Save the Queen" was then sung
by the whole party, accompanied by the
orchestra.
In speaking- to tho toast of "The Prr-si
deiit of the United State.B," the chairman
"CHOOSE BETWEEN
US," SAID THE WIFE
Husband Selected h\er Rival, ar>d
She Drove H*â¢ fron)
the House.
I'KIAH, May 24.â When Mrs. Inez Adams a popular married young
â¢woman of this city, hud incidents called to her attention warranting a be
lief that her husband was untrue, she didn't go into hysterics and "make a
scene," but on the contrary adopted measures so original that the gossips are
talking of nothing else. Mrs. Adams, whose maiden name was Sloper, was
married to Herbert Adams, a good-looking young fellow employed at the
Palace Hotel, about eight months ago. Until a few weeks ago their life
se< mcd to be a continual honeymoon. Finally the husband began to give the
tongue of scandal an opportunity to wag by paying marked attention to Miss
Bessie Braden. a pretty girl, whose home is at Fort Bragg. Miss Braden
has been a member of Mrs. Anna Porterfield's normal class for some time.
Last Sunday Mrs. Adams sent for Miss Braden, with whom she had al
ways been very friendly, and told her there was to be an entertainment at
her residence that evening. The girl came and was dined and otherwise enter
tained until the arrival of her husband.
Then came the entertainment promised. Rising to her feet the irate wife
confronted the two and tragically exclaimed:
"Now, sir, 1 understand that you are paying attentions to this lady.
Choose between us."
For a moment the husband was dumfounded, but only for a moment. He
went over to Miss Braden and took her hand with the simple statement that
he "had followed the lead of his heart.
The wife asked them to wait a moment and in a trice had her husband's
grip packed. Returning, she told him to take the girl and the grip and
leave with them or she would till them both full of lead. They departid
without any argument.
Mrs. Adams has returned to her home and will sue for a divorce. So great
a scandal was caused by the occurrence that Miss Braden was dismissed
from the normal class.
alluded to the peculiarly difficult circum
â¢ a in which President McKlnley
found himself and to the patience, tact
and courage which he had displayed.
'â¢Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean,'.'
was then rendered by the orchestra and
lung by the assemblage. "The British
Benevolent Society of California" was
proposed by the toastmaster and re
sponded to by the Consul General, who
humorously said that it had the distinc
tion of being the worst-supported society
within his knowledge.
G. C Woodward, the secretary of the
society, made some remarks upon its
finances. W. Kalnaves sang "Nelson,"
and for an encore gave "Hearts ot Oak.'
"The Land We Came From" was as
sipned on the programme to William
Greer Harrison, but. in his absence, F.
D. Brandon made an excellent speech.
"Rule Britannia" having been sung by
the whole company. J. C. Hughes gave
good renderings of "The Gallants of Eng
land." "The Friar of Orders Gray" and
"The March of the Men of Harlech.
Hugh Craig, speaking to "The Land We
Live in," made an allusion to the good
understanding existing between Dewt-y
and tho British admiral at Manila, ftnd
to the vast strength of the English
speaking; peoples.
F. M. Coffin sang "The Star-Spangled
Banner." and for an encore a song by Sir
Arthur Sullivan, entitled "Where is An
other Sweet as My Sweet?"
Vincent Neale responded for "The La
dles " the Rev. W. H. L. O'Rorke for
"Sister Societies" and Arthur Barendt for
"The Press." Songs by C. J. McCollum.

ing engineer in Lower California. Mr.
Hurr wrote from Calmalli, eighty miles
norlheast of. the Cerro Pinto placers,
as follows:
There are placers about a hundred
miles south of here which will boom in
side of eighteen months. The miners are
working <lry washers. They come to the
store and pile up pounds of gold right
before my eyes and the outside world has
not known anything about this. This
has been going on for years and they
have hardly begun on the placers, they
are so extensive. Half-ounce and ounce
nuggets are not uncommon, and I am in
formed that but a short time ago a man
took out one of five pounds.
In another letter, dated March 24,
1898, Mr. Burr wrote to Gordon & Good
win that the placers, which he had
prospected to some extent since his pre
vious letter, would run from 50 cents
to $200 to the yard. For some reason
Gordon & Goodwin were not interested
In the placers. Mr. Burr was on a mis
sion connected with copper mines and
the news of the find was never made
public, or, if it was, no excitement and
rush followed, as promises to be the
case now.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1899.
CREEDE HAD GOLD
IN A DENVER BANK
Fortune Found for Little
Dorothy.
Bpecial Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 24.â John T.
Jones, the attorney handling the proper
ty of the late N. C. Creede. has returned
from a trip East. He visited Denver to
clear certain business details left by
Creede in that city In a rather chaotic
condition. Major Jones sought out the
First National Bank of that city, where
he presented Creede's bankbooks to have
the account of the dead miner straight
ened. No one believed Creede had a
penny left In the Denver bank, no record
of any deposit in that institution having
been found among his effects, but upon
checking up Creede's deposit he was
found to have a balance In the bank of
$19,003 SO. Major Jones received word
from Denver yesterday that the money
had been turned over to the Creede
estate.
If Major Jonec can hring It about, little
Dorothy Creede will come in for another
windfall in the form of stock in th*e cele
brated Amethyst mine, at Creede. Col.,
valued at $1,150,000. This property is
claimed as Creede 8 share, and unless the
claim is allowed suit will be brought to
recover it.
Major Jones said to-day that unless the
owners of the mineâ D. H. Moffat, W. S.
Cheeseman, L. Campbell and E. T.
Smith, all of Denverâ made .a satisfac
tory compromise, the case would be tak
en into the courts. The necessary legal
documents are now being flrawn. It is
Major Jones' opinion that the case prob
ably will be settled out of court.
Dorothy Creede. who waÂ« ndoptf'i by
the dead miner a short time before he
died, Is now with her mother, Mrs. Bass
ford, at San Francisco.

COGHLAN WANTED TO
GO TO MARE ISLAND
But He Will Have a More Important
Command at Puget
Sound.
. NEW YORK, May 24.-The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: I was told to-day that v nptaln
Coghlan desired to fco to the Mare Island
navy yard. A vacancy did exist at that
point, filled by the orders issued to-day
to Captain W. W. Mead, recently retired
from command of the cruiser Brooklyn
but It is explained that both the Secre
tary and Admiral Crowninshleld believed
that Captain Ooghlan would prefer an
Independent command, such aa he will
have at Puget Sound, rather than a su
bordinate position which he would have
secured had he been sent to Mare Island
Should Captain Ooghlan make any ob
jections to his assignment the depart
ment will willingly transfer him to some
other point.
Because of the large drydock at Puget
Sound, the only dock on the Sound
which can accommodate battleships, the
Puget Sound station is one of Import
anceâ must more ho than that of Port
Royal, to which Rear Admiral Sumner.
Captain Coghlan's senior, has been as
signed.
To Revive District Fairs.
STOCKTON, May 24.â An effort is be
ing made to obtain a local board of di
rectors for the San Joaquin Agricultural
Association which will disentangle the
financial difficulties of the district and de
vise means for resuming the fairs which
for many years drew throngs of people to
Stockton. Acting upon the request ct the
Governor the Democratic and Republican
county committees have submitted the
names of a number of energetic young
business men and it is expected appoint
ments will be made soon. The Republi
can committee submits five namesâ two
more than the Democratic. The board Is
at present very Democratic in complexion
and it is the desire of the political friends
of the Governor to see him give both par
ties equal representation. The old asso
ciation owes about $18,000, but holds $45,
--000 worth of property. There 1b a plan to
turn over the property to the city or
county in consideration of the payment
of the outstanding indebtedness, the fair
thereafter to be at least nominally under
the control of City Council or Board of
Supervises. It is believed that when the
new hoarl is appointed some plan will he
devised to Improve the property and re
sume the fairs and race meets.

Married.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, May 24.â There were
two interesting developments in the cele
brated Wright-Purtelle damage suit to
day. In an answer liled by Attorney Hep

man bearing his name, while Wright him
self recorded a mortgage for $17,000 on
the property of the American Land and

that he is in financial as well as legal

of the complaint are denied generally and
specifically. Wright has ail along as
serted that he would spring a surprise
on the plaintiff, ami he made good his
word. In speaking of the relationship be
tween Purtelle and his wife the complaint
reads:
The defendant alleges that he has no in
formation ami belief sufficient to enable him
to answer the first allegation or paragraph
of the first count of said complaint, and, there
fore, placing his denial upon that ground, the
defendant denies that May I'urtelle and W.
H. Purtolle were lawfully or otherwlM or .it
all intermarried on October 1. IS9I, or at any
other time or at the city of Vancouver. State

career exceeding in length that of Queen
Victoria by thirty years was closed at
San Gabriel Mission to-day by the burial
of Senora Francesca de Luga. Born of
wealthy parents, she died on Monday last
in a hut at Linda Vista, a suburb of
wealthy Pasadena. The date of her birth
is contained in the archives of the San
Juan Capistrano Mission and is October
23 1789. She was born a direct subject of
Charles IV of Spain, long before Mexico
became a republic, and lived to see the
last vestige of Spanish rule disappear
from her native land.
Dr. Reid in his history of Pasadena
says that at the time the Two Days
battle was fought, beginning January 9,
1847 she noted as supply agent and com
missary for the Mexican troops, galloping
about on horseback gathering supplies,
although she was thpn 58 years old.
Senora Lugo had been bedridden for the
last ten years, but retained her clearness
of mind up to the last moment, giving
parting advice to her seven grandchil
dren at the very last.
ASKS FOR A REHEARING.
Los Angeles' Petition in the Watec
Company Case.
LOS ANGELES, May 24,-The city of
Los Angeles, through the city attorney,
has filed an application before the Su
preme Court for a rehearing of the re
ceivership case in the litigation between
the city and the Los Angelos City Water
Company. The Supreme Court has de
cided that the receivership under which
the water company was prevented col
lecting water rents and expending money
for maintenance and improvements was
invalid. In the city's petition it is as
sumed that that part of the decision of
the Supreme Court which is to the ef
fect that Los Angeles city is not a ripa
rian proprietor is unnecessary and unsus
talned.
The Mayor signed to-day the ordinance
recently passed by the City Council which
accepts the award made by the board of
arbitrators selected to settle the amount
to be paid by the city for the water com
pany's plant.

OLYMPIC CLUB
THE SCENE OF
SPIRITED BOUTS
Ed Johnson of Oregon
Meets Defeat.
The Olympic Club gymnasium was
crowded last evening with members and
sportsmen, who gathered to witness the
finals of the series of boxing contests and
a special bout between the middle-weight
champions of California and Oregon.
A special prize was offered for a six
round contest between E. Johnson, the
champion middle-weight boxer of the
Multnomah Athletic Club of Portland, Or.,
and J. McDonald, middle-weight cham
pion of the Olympic Club.
George Green and "Bob" McArthur sec
onded Johnson and J. F. McCarthy and
De Witt Van Court looked after the in
terests of McDonald. In the first round
McDonald used foul tactics by holding his
opponent's hand and then landing on
Johnson's neck with the right. He was
cautioned by Referee Smith, but repeated
the offense several times during the
round. Johnson stopped cleverly several
leads for the stomach, but failed to
guard swings aimed at his head. Mc-
Donald had the best of the second round,
landing quite frequently on Johnson's
neck, but he could not resist engaging In
foul play, much to the disgust of the
Oregonian, who appealed to the referee.
Johnson, who is a six-footer, had evi
dently been sparring with some one who i
was his eciual in height, and McDonald,
Who is a stocky built fellow, assumed a
crouching position and easily ducked
Johnson's blows, which went sailing over
his head. Then again, the Olympian
would dash at his opponent, who stood on
guard waiting for the attack, and smash
Johnson a left on the jaw and retire with
out a return blow..
Johnson's failure was owing principally
to his method of fighting. He invariably
waited for the attack and instead of up
jx-rcutting his antagonist when the op
portunity arrived he stood posing, and
while thinking what was best to do with
a man less his size by several inches he
invariably received a left hand smash
in the face, which upset all his plans. In
the fifth round Johnson was sent to the
canvas by a right-hander on the jaw,
where he remained eight seconds. He got
tip only to be sent down again, and then
the timely gona sounaed the end of the
round.
The seconds of the Multnomah Club's
champion, seeing that Johnson's fight was
hopeless, signaled defeat and amid wild
cheers McDonald was declared the victor.
Johnson, however, put up a game fight.
W. J. Leonard of tue Olympic Club de
feated William Hoskins of the Excelsior
Club in a six-round bout. Leonard's body
punches knocked the steam out of Hos
kins. who fought gamely to the end.
"Doc" Flynn of the Excelsior Club got
a decision over J. Kane of the Liberty
Club, but it must be f-aid with all credit
to Kane that he suffered defeat only by
the very poor judgment displayed by the
judges, who received well merited cen
sure from the members. The judges were
S. Carter of the Olympic Club and Frank
Cerini of the Reliance Club of Oakland.
The results of the rounds fought were:
In the first Kane scored most points.
The second and t^ird were evenly con
tested. The fourth round was Kane's be
yond a question of doubt. In the fifth
Kane sent his opponent to the carpet and
had all the better of the argument. The
sixth was fairly even, although Kane had
a shade the best of the round. How the
judges could have figured otherwise is a
mystery even to the boxer who was
handed the championship belt. He cer
tainly will not condescend to wear it as
an emblem of victory.
A. Hellman of the Sacramento Athletic
Club lost a decision by his own foolish
ness. He thought that F. Ast of the
Manhattan Athletic Club was easy game
and started in at the sound of the gong
to mix things and win a quick and easy
victory. The first round was give and
take. Ast held his own with the heavy
hitting lad from the capital city, and in
the second round alter some hot ex
changes Hellman ran bang into a right
hand cross which caught him on the jaw
point, and down went Hellman on his
back. When he regained his equilibrium
he wanted to know what had happened.
"Why, can't you see what is up? asked
one of his seconds. "Look across the ring
and you will witness the rrsult. There
is Professor Ast, the jaw-smasher, try
ing on the Hermann Oelrichs' champion
belt." Poor Hellman looked surprised,
and wondered how he received the blow
that killed his aspirations.
NEALL COURT-MARTIAL.
Findings in the Case Transmitted to
the Secretary of Wa/.
The findings of the court-martial in the
case of Lieutenant J. M. Neall, Fourth
Cavalry. U. S. A., have been forwarded
to Washington for the approval of the
Secretary of War. Among army officers
and others familiar with military affairs
the opinion is entertained that if executive
clemency is not Interposed the accused
will be dismissed from the army
PAUNCEFOTE HOPES FOR
ARBITRATION TRIBUNAL
LONDON, May 25.â The correspondent
of the Daily News at The Hague says:
Sir Julian Pauncefote entertains the hope
that the Peace Conference will favor the
establishment of a permanent tribunal for
optional recourse for arbitration and me
diation. He says: "What is wanted is
to secure prompt and certain aids to in
ternational justice. This is the right way
to discourage the UFe of forces to further
the cause of arbitration. The mere fact
of the existence of such a tribunal would
exert a potent influence in behalf of in
ternational justice."
It is considered a good omen that
American and Spanish flags are flying
from the neighboring windows of a hotel 'â 
where the delegates of these nations are
fellow-guests. It is understood that the
sort of organic statute Great Britain and ;
the United States are prepared to sup
port is one on the lines of the memorial
of the New York Bar Association to |
President McKinley.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
Woman's power is largely dependent
upon her ability to interest, entertain, at-
tract and please. It is for this reason that
women strive to become accomplished.
They study in order that they may converse
intelligently on all subjects. They strive
to become {rood musicians, graceful dan-
cers and amiable hostesses.
All accomplishments are unavailing if a
woman suffers from ill-health in a womanly -v
way. The special weakness peculiar to the w^
womanly organism, will rapidly wreck the'
general health. The sufferer will lose her
natural vivacity, her wit, her good looks,
and the ambition and power to display the
accomplishments at her command. Any
woman affected in this way should resort J
to Dr. Pierces Favorite Prescription. j It is
a wonderful medicine for ailing women. It
is the invention of an eminent and skillful
physician, Dr. R. V. Pierce, for thirty years
chief consulting physician to the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buffalo,
N. Y. It aims to cure but one class of dis-
eases, and claims to be good for nothing
else. It imparts health, elastic strength,
vigor and virility to the delicate feminine
organs. It prepares a woman for wifehood
and motherhood.
Mrs. Ramon Sanchez. Penasco, Taos r County,
N. Mex., in a letter to Dr. Pierce says: " From a
grateful heart my voice goes up to God both night
and day in a solemn prayer that He may guard
your health and preserve your life. I hereby ex-
press my gratitude to you for the relief I have
received from your wonderful medicine, ' Favor-
ite Prescription.' After suffering: years of misery
I am to-day a healthy and happy wife, and can
truthfully recommend to women the use of the
' Favorite Prescription ' as a regulator of the
monthly periods. '

A DISADVANTAGE
Views of Los Angeles'
Learned Men.
REPLY TO MR. HUNTINGTON
HIS DECLARED TO BE A MER
CENARY OPINION.
Knowledge Acquired in Colleges, They
Assert, Does Not Unfit a Man
for Fighting Life's
Battles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 24.â Angeles
! educators do not agree with Collis P.
Huntington in the statement he made at
a recent function that college training
lessens the chances of a man in life's bat
tle. Particular" objection is made to the
> 'Wing assertion by the railroad mag- ,
nate: " *w
"How many young: men with college ed- :
ucations are standing about waiting for
something that will never come because !
the work that lies nearest at hand is not j
to their liking? Somehow or other our j
schools which teach young people how to
talk -do not teach them how to live."
When asked to express an opinion on :
Mr. Huntlngton's speech President E. T. i
Pierce of the State Normal School said: '
"So far as public school education is j
concerned l have /expressed my- i
self. I would not say wtih him that I re- !
gret the tendency to higher education. . I 'â 
I believe most firmly in that. We ought to |
give our young people practical views of
life and the ability to take their places in
society as workers. I don't believe young
people are fitted for the practical work of
life at the age of 15 to 21 j ears, but 1 do
believe that their education during that
period should be of a nature to tit them '
for it. J would not have any one stop at- ;
tending school between the ages or 13 and
1!1. That is not the thing to look forward
to."
"Huntington is all wrong," said Profes
sor James A. Foshay, Superintendent of
Los Angeles Public Schools. " - The chil
dren must be trainedâ and when I say I
trained 1 mean all-around training. If
!we would have it Ideal the bt|Jiy must be
trained as well as the mind. Education I
should be threefoldâ mental, moral and !
physical. 1 believe physical training
should receive much more attention than
it does. In regard to Intellectual train
ing we cannot have too much. People
should be taught how to talk and how to
live; the one as well as the other; and edu
cation should mean both. The educated
man. if he is going to dig a ditch, can do
the work just as well as or better than I
he could were he uneducated. His educa
tion will certainly not be a drawback to'
him. an.-i it must be a benefit."
(President George W. White, of the
University of California, said he had i
read Huntington"s speech. In discussing
the railroad president's language he did
not npare his words.
"Huntington voices, I suppose, the 1
mercenary side of the question," said the
college president, "as well as it could be
voiced. A great many people think that
a man should educate himself for busi- i
ness purposes, but it is a very defective
view of education. Education should
I have a higher motive than that. It does
help a man in his business life. I don't
believe Huntington's statement that;
higher education unfits a man for busi
ness life: It a man is judged as to his i
business capacity upon the conclusion of !
his college education he might not make !
a very good showing as compared with
the man who has spent some years in a
distinctly business training, but put the
college trained man at the beginning of :
a business training beside the man who
lias not had a college training and he
will distance him every time. Having
had his faculties trained to education. It
is all to his advantage.
"The effort has been to combine the
two Ideasâ that is. to put the first part
of the college course into general culture
and the last part Into specializing to fit
a man for whatever line he expects to
follow. This prevents the common weak
ness, which Is one of the most dangerous
things in the human mmd â the tendency
to run to one Idea. The one-idea man
i? the crank and is liable to become a
â  dangerous man to the community by his
" unbalanced judgment.
"That is the purely mercenary or busi
ness side of education. My judgment is ;
that the highest value of education Is j
the selfhood of the Individual. Its real
i worth is in the development of mental
power whereby a man puts himself in
touch With the best things the world has
produced, makes himself a part of the
best in all the realms of thought. That
is the real value of education, with which
the money value is not to be compared ,
at all. The greatest menace to our ed
ucational system of to-day Is such senti
ments as Mr. Huntington has expressed,
by which the mercenary Influence is
given the highest place and young men
are led to think that money-making is |
the chief end and aim of life."

INSANE ASIATICS TO
BE RETURNED HOME
California Asylums Shall Be Relieved
of the Burden of Caring for
Them.
STOCKTON, May 24.â The eighty-five
f'hinf-?<Â» and five Japanese inmates of the
Stockton State Hospital for the Insane
are shortly to be returned to their re
spective countries. Word to this effect
has been received by the local managers
from the State Lunacy Commission,
which has for some time been negotiat
ing with the Japanese and Chinese Gov
ernments with this end in view. Both
Governments have expressed a willing
ness to bear the expense of returning the
afflicted ones. The patients will be de
livered on board ship, and thereafter the
agents of the foreign governments will
become responsible for them. The depor
tation agreement extends to all asylums
in the State. It will relieve the taxpay
ers of heavy expense and the officials of
much trouble, as the Asiatics are hard
to care for. Some idea of the cost to the
State may be gained from the fact that
about one in sixteen of the Inmates of
the local institution is an Asiatic.
CONSTITUTIONALITY OF
FIXING WATER RATES
Supreme Court Holds That Munici-
palities Have a Rig-ht to Regu
late Compensation.
WASHINGTON, May 24.â 1n the United
States Supreme Court prior to adjourn
ment Justice Harlan announced an opin
ion in the case of the San Diego Land
and Town Company against the City of
National City, Cal., ana others. The suit

thorities of National City for the year of
1896, which the land company claimed
were so low as to be confiscatory A
Circuit Court refused to accept this view
and Issued a decree dismissing the bill
Justice Harlan's opinion confirmed this
view.
The fase Involved the validity of the
California State law authorizing county
and town and city authorities in that
State to fix annually the rates that shall

BRIGHT OUTLOOK
ON THE RANCHES
Grain and Fruit Doing
Nicely.
Special Dispatch to The Tall.
: SAN* JOSE, May 24.â There was a slight
i rain here last night, but the total pre
cipitation amounted to but a trace. ] lay
ing is in full progress. The crop is good,
but not so heavy as hail been expected
after the March rains. Late sown crops
Will be light. The cool weather baa helped
grain. Cherries are ripening rapidly and
being shipped. In a few localities the
crop is good. Taking the valley over the
crop is unusually light. Peaches are
heavy, but some orchards have dropped
the leaves, owing to the "curled leaf."
Apricots are light. Prunes will not be
lan average crop. Prices are good, and
i all in all the season promises to be a
profitable one.
LOS ANGELES, May 24.â weather
1 in Southern California during the last few
' weeks has been favorable to crops,
: though the lack of sufficient rainfall dur
; ing the season is being felt. The nights
| have been cool and foggy and plants and
trees have taken considerable moisture
from the atmosphere. The weather has
been more uniformly cool during May
j than for any May for several years.
Oranges, lemons and deciduous fruits
i promise well. A fair hay and grain crop
has been harvested. Irrigating' water is
scarce, but many artesian wells are be
ing driven to supply the lack.
SAN MIGUEL, May 24.â heavy
frost of Monday night did more damage
than was at first thought, especially in
the lowlands, where ice formed. Frost at
I this date in this locality has not been
known in years. In some places north of
i here the grain crops have been almost
entirely ruined by the frost, and the grain
has been cut for hay. The most sanguine
estimates of the yield in this vicinity
place the product at only a half crop, ex
cept in some of the western, country,
where the yield will be greater.
STOCKTON. May 24.â The cool, cloudy
| weather of the past week or ten days :
' has been of the greatest benefit to grow
; ing grain, which was beginning to suffer
i for the want of moisture. The cloudy
; weather came just in the nick of time- to
insure an immense grain harvest. Bomo ;
i injury has been done to grapes and
| other fruit and almonds by frost, but on
I the whole San Joaquin County will make j
' a splendid showing, especially an regards
' grain, and it is believed it will be the i
I banner grain producer.
SACRAMENTO, May 24.â The weather
here was rather cool to-day, four- j
hundredths of an inch of rain having ;
fallen last night. During the afternoon !
: there were showers. The cool weather
is not favorable to the rapid ripening of
! fruit, but rain, it is claimed, will not do j
] any damage to fruit. Tlk- grain rrop in I
this locality will be enormous. Similar
good reports come from all over the Sac
ramento Valley.
RED BLL'FF. May 24.â Considerable
' rain fell in this section to-day. The down- !
fall is believed to have been general here
' abouts. Very little hay is down, and con
sequently thorp will be no damage, but i
Instead "considerable benefit to fruit and '
gr-.wlng crops.
sriSTN. May 24.â Light rain prevailed
jat intervals throughout Bolano County
j to-day, not In sufficient quantity, how
ever, to do much damage. Haying opera- ;
I tions are now in full blast and heavy
rains would prove destructive.
PACIFIC GROVE, May 24.â This section
was visited by a shower early this morn
â¢ ing. The rain was local, extending only
over this immediate vicinity. Threaten
ing clouds and high winds continued dur
i ing the day.
SAN DIEGO, May 24.â The weather is
dry and moderately warm and the nights
t cool and partly cloudy. Fruits are doing !
well A fair hay crop is In sight.
SANTA CRI'Z. May 24.â 1t commenced
; raining at 2 o'clock this morning and since
, then there have been occasional showers.
i They are needed at this time.
SANTA ROSA, May 24.â More heavy
showers of rain to-day and rain is falling
: to-night. It is of immense benefit to the
hay and grain crops.
NAPA, May 24.â One-hnlf inch of rain
! fell last night and to-day. Occasional
showers are still falling.
WOODLAND, May 24.â Showers pre
: vailed generally throughout the county
this morning, although there are a few
! localities in which the rainfall was so
, light as to be scarcely perceptible. The
i precipitation was heaviest in the foot
! hills between Capay and Winters. If the
' weather should clear up now the damage
1 to the hay crop would not be very seri
ous and would probably be compensated
for by the benefit to winter-sown grain,
which in many cases is badly in need of
moisture. If the showers continue much
longer the damage to hay will be a seri
ous matter, as a great deal of it is still
in the shock or winrow. Fortunately
there was no wind during the showers.
If a windstorm had prevailed at the same
time a great deal of the rank, summer
, fallowed wheat would have been knocked
down. So far no damage his resulted to
wheat.
A PECULIAR STORM.
Just a Little Rain From the
Inland.
Local Forecaster M< Adie says that the
showers which have visted the northern
part of the State during the past thirty
six hours were caused by a storm which
began at Tehachapi. The storm worked
rapidly toward the* north, inland between
the Sierras and the Rockies. It then
veered slightly eastward to Idaho and
Montana. From there it will probably
go up the Missouri Valley and give rain
to the East
"It was a peculiar storm," said Mr. Me- j
Adie. "inasmuch that Northern Califor
tlia got a little rain after the storm had
1 I. Eastern Oregon had some rain.
; and the Sacramento, Napa, Vaca and So
noma valleys had slight showers. There
was only a trace In the Santa Clara Val-
Lley. About .1" of an inch fell in the city.!
and that was the average for the points
visited,
M Th.- ctnrm difl not ootWe rrr.ni th<Â» j
ocean this time, but was of inland growth j
in Southeastern California. It was not)
heavy enough to do any damage. It will i
[ not hurt the cherries or hay. and it will ,
;do grain a. little good. The present con- I
ditions are U*r clearing weather to-day.
"The prospects are splendid for all
kinds of crops In the State. In the Sac
ramento Valley and fruit are looking
well, and haying, which is now In full
blast, promises a large crop of excellent
quality. Hop vines are thrifty, and early ]
peaches will be gathered soon. The cool '
\ weather somewhat retards the ripening
!of fruit. Rain would be beneficial in the .
, San Joaquin, but early wheat and barley |
will yield a fair crop. In Fresno County j
fruit and grapes are doing well, and the I
hay crop on irrigated lands is better than j
expected. In Sonoma County the vine- j
yards are in first-class condition, and In I
San Benito the wheat is all being cut for I
hay. in Monterey peaches and apples will !
he a full crop, but prunes, pears and ap- I
1 ricots will be light. In Los Angeles the |
j cool weather is favorable to growing
grain and orchards. Beets are growing
nicely, but early planted beans are not
cming up well. The frost in some sec
| tlons has injured vines and vegetables."
MILITIA IN READINESS
TO PROTECT NEGROES
GRIFFIN. Oa.. May 24.â The flogging
of three colored operatives of the Kin
raid mills on Monday ni-ght by whiteoaps j
lias led to sensational developments. Last
night another negro was taken from his
house and severely beaten and cut. These
negroes are law abiding citizens. To-day
the superintendent and others at the Kin
oaid mills were notified to leave at once
or they would be "dealt with."
It now transpires that there has been
a club formed here known as the Labor
ers' I'nion Band, with the purpose of
driving the negroes out of the country.
The band has about 500 members, a large
number of whom are boys under age.
I'pon orders from the Governor the Grif
fin Rifles are in their armory awaiting
orders from Judge Hammon to proceed
jto the factory. The Mayor has been re
liably informed that if the militia goes
; to the factory there will be trouble in the
city to-night. He has ordered all the po
lite- on duty throughout the night.
TO DEVELOP COOKS
INLET COAL FIELDS
SEATTLE, May 24.â Tho Standard Oil
Company, having acquired not only the
old Russian title but a later mineral land
grant from tho United States Government
to the coal lands at Cooks Inlet, Alaska,
is preparing to develop the coal fields,
which are of vast extent. The company
has already deposited $100,000 with local
l>;mks fr.r the use of Alfred Ray, its man
ager here, who has outtltted a corps of
engineers, that will sail on the Orizaba
to-morrow. These engineers will complete
â  surveys already partially made and make
: other surveys for wharves, railroads from
the mines to the shore, etc.
The Cooks Inlet coal mines, as they are
commonly known, were first worked by
the Russians years ago and later by a
[ San Francisco company, but questions of
title and the vast amount of money re
quired to develop the mines hindered the
! work until the Standard Oil Company se
i cured control.
Gunning Gets the Salary.
MARYSVILLE. May 24.-In the case of
S. O. Gunning. Auditor, vs. G. W. Pine,
Treasurer, Judge Ellison of Red Bluff to
day handed down a judgment in favor
of Gunning. The court holds that as
Gunning has been in possession of the of
fice of Auditor and Recorder, and has
discharged the duties thereof ever since
the certificate "f election was issued to
him by the Hoard of Supervisors, he is
despite the fact that P. H. Day, his op
ponent at the November election, has in
stituted a contest for the office, entitled
to the monthly salary attached to the of
fice. The Judge directs that a peremp
tory writ of mandate be issued instruct
ing Treasurer Pine to pay the Auditor's
salary so long as he Is In possession of
the office.
Fruit Growers' Plans.
SACRAMENTO, May 24.â The executive
committee of the California Fruit Grow
ers' Association was in session to-night.
It is formulating plans to carry out the
idea of the convention as expressed in
oucn session.
ASSASSIN HID
IN HIS CABIN
Arizona Section Fore
man Murdered.
STRUCK DOWN BY A MEXICAN
ATTACKED FROM BEHIND IN
HIS OWN HOME.
Citizens of Ashford May Lynch the
Cowardly Slayer of Francis F.
Harris if He Is
Captured.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ASHFORK, Ariz., May 24.â Francis F.
Harris, a section foreman in the employ
of the Santa Fe Pacific Railroad, was
murdered last night in his cabin, near
the depot, where he lived alone. He was
found this morning lying in a corner of
the cabin, covered with blood from head
to foot and grasping in one hand hair
torn from his own head. Blood was
spattered over the walls and floor.
The crime was committed at about 0
o'clock last night. Harris evidently had
just come into the cabin, hung up his
i coat, lighted the lamp and was preparing
! his evening meal when attacked from be
hind and felled with a powerful blow
: from a blunt instrument, probably a
j coupling pin. Within four feet of him
! lay his revolver and belt, which he had
just unbuckled. The first blow from his
assailant probably rendered him uncon
] scious. The top and back of his head
| had been beaten into a pulp.
The crime evidently was committed out
of revenge by a Mexican whom Harris
recently discharged and who had since
I been making- threats against him. Rob
bery also had been committed, a watch
and considerable money being missing.
The murderer burned his own blood-be
spattered clothing within a few yards of
j where his victim lay.
The Mexican disappeared at an early
hour this morning. He was seen at Wins
low attempting to dispose of a watch to
a newsboy on a train. Officers are in
hot pursuit and it 1? likely he will be in
custody before morning.
: Harris was 48 years old and unmarried.
He came from Champaign, Illinois, where
I a brother and other relatives live. He
had been in the employ of the railroad
for some years and had many friends.
The murder has caused great excite
ment and there is talk of a lynching.
CHANGE OF VENUE SOUGHT.
Move in the Case of Yolo County
Against Controller Colgan.
WOODLAND. May 24.â Attorney Gen
eral Tirey L,. Ford has tiled in the Supe
rior Court a motion for a change of venue
in the case of the County of Yolo vs. E.
P. Colgan, Controller of the State of Cali
fornia, in which the plaintiff seeks to re
cover a. large sum of money alleged to be
due from the State for fees for collecting
taxes for several years past. The motion
is based upon an affidavit tiled by the At
torney General to the effect that Yolo
County is not the proper place and that
the case should be transferred to Sacra
mento County because the defendant is
.i resident of that county and not a resi
dent of Yolo County.
The defendant also demurs to the com
plaint on the grounds that the Treasurer
.if Volo County is the proper person to
bring the a*>ti._u*.
The writ of mandate Is returnable be
fore Judge Gaddis on Saturday, May 27,
at which time the motion and demurrer
will be heard.

Rumor Has It That Varney Gaskill
Will Be Made Secretary of
the Paris World's Fair
Commission.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 24.â Governor
Henry T. Gage to-day said positively he
would not make any more appointments
until after he returned north on June 1.
Few persons had an opportunity to see
him, much less talk with him. He says
I he expects to be "in and out" all this
! week. His itinerary for the visits to State
; institutions is kept secret. He does not
| want to be waylaid by politicians and of
! floe seekers. It Is known the Governor
â¢ will visit the insane asylum at Highlands
| to-morrow, and that he may remain at
the institution over night.
Editor John MeGonigle of the Ventura
Democrat, who is one of the asylum trus
! tees, was closeted with the Governor for
!an hour this morning. He was called to
suggest what sort of a man the Governor
ought to appoint to fill the vacancy ex-
I isting in the board through the resigna
tion of Major Harry W. Patton.
The first meeting of the Paris Exposi
tion Commission will be held in San Fran
cis"co on Monday. Major Ben C. Truman
will leave Los Angeles on Saturday or
! Monday. The commission has been called
i to meet in the office of W. \V. Foote. The
j meeting will organize with the election
! of a chairman, a secretary and possibly
:an assistant secretary. Other attaches
| are now to be appointed at this time.
While the Governor has announced that
he will have nothing to do with the ap
pointment of the secretary of the commis
sion, the "push" Is insisting to-night that
the Governor has been taken into the con
fidence of the Commissioners, and that
there is some understanding between the
Governor and the Commissioners in re
gard to this appointment. As a matter
! of fact, it is proclaimed that Varney Gas
: kill is the man who has been selected,
and that the Oakland politician will soon
I be clothed with the Insignia of office.
It was said to-night that James Camp
bell of Pasadena, a Republican and a
.member of the now famous Americus
Club, stands an excellent chance of be
ing appointed one of the trustees of the
State school at Whlttier.
Judge Shaw this morning visited Gov
ernor Gage and presented the State ex
ecutive the indorsement of Judge J. J.
Campbell of San Bernardino County for
! the temporary appointment to the pro
: bate bench of this county during the 111â
; ness of the incumbent. Judge W. H.
Clark. Governor Gage pocketed the let
ter presented by Judge Shaw, remarking
that he would look into the matter.

DR. KILMER'S REMEDIES.
FREE TO SUFFERERS.
The New Cure for Kidney, Bladder
and Uric Acid Troubles.
Almost everybody who reads the
newspapers is sure to know of the won-
derful cures made by Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy.
It is the great medical triumph of the
nineteenth century; discovered after
years of scientific research by Dr. Kil-
mer, the eminent kidney and bladder
specialist, and is wonderfully success-
ful in promptly curing kidney, liver,
bladder and uric acid troubles.
Swamp-Root has been tested in so
many ways, in hospital work. In private
practice, among the helpless, too poor
to purchase relief, and has proved so
successful in every case that a special
arrangement has been made by which
all readers of The Call who have not
already tried it may have a sample
bottle sent free by mail, also a book
telling more about Swamp-Root and
how to find out if you have kidney or
bladder trouble. "When writing mention
reading this generous offer in the San
Francisco Call and send your address
to Dr. Kilmer & Co., Binghamton, N.
Y. The regular fifty-cent and one-dol-
lar sizes are sold by all first-class drug-
gists. -

GROEZINGER
HEARD THEY
WERE INNOCENT
Why He Released Five
Bunko Men.
TRUSTED TO THEIR HONOR
A NEW THING IN THE FREEING
OF PRISONERS.
Their Attorney Told the Learned
Judge His Clients Were on Their
Way to the Butchers'
Picnic.
Justice of the Peace Groezinger, acting
Police Judge In the absence of Judge
Tn adwell, again distinguished himself
yesterday by an instance of the depth of
his legal knowledge and his willingness
to help the crooked and the lawbreaker.
The police had gathered in ten bunko
ers, men of a gang they had beta
chasing for weeks, and the learned jurist
allowed five of them to go on their own
recognizance. They were all charged with
vagrancy, and what recognizance a va
grant has that will pass in a court of law
has always been an open question; but
the question was not too deep a "tie for
the learned Judge. He accepted their
simple promipe to come into court when
: upon, and perhaps he expects them
to come. â¢
The gang of bunko men which the police
determined to break up has been operat
ing for a long time. The members of the
gang are all smooth men, and they are
well up on the ways of the bunko men and
of the innocent. They are all things to all
men, and their game is anything Irom a
Sold brick to a half interest swindle; they
will do the employment agency act and
will sell houses and lots and country
lands; they operate in an obscure lodging
bouse to-day and by to-morrow they have
moved and there is no trace of their
whereabouts. Altogether they have given
the police a great deal of trouble, and
finally Captain Wittman detailed
Policemen < happelle and Cullinan to
round them up and bring them in. The
two policemen have spent several days
on the trail, and they finally secured
enough evidence to warrant the arrest of
the ten on charges of vagrancy. The idea
was to corral as many as possible, and
when the watch was assembled after the
drill yesterday morning to parade th"
prisoners so the men of the watch would
know them and be able to warn any un
suspecting looking person in whose com
pany they were seen.
The men were arrested and the plan
pave every evidence of being successfully
carried out. The watch was present and
the prisoners were sent for, but the an
swer came back that they had all been
eased. The records show that two were
released by Judge Graham, each on cash
bail of 1100; three more were released by
Judge Groezinger on cash ball of $50 and
live were released by Groezinger on their
own recognizance.
When Wittman heard of the release
of the prisoners he vowed he would make
trouble. He went into Groezinger's court
and from the bar demanded the reason
for the release of the men. Groezinger
explained that their attorney. Arthur
Mack, had told him the men were inno
cenr and that they had bÂ«n Â«rrcoted
while on tiieii; way 10 the butchers' pic
nic. Then A\ Ittman demanded the rec
ognizance which they had given and it
turned out that the learned Judge had
not even their signature. For a man to
be released on his own recognizance
means that he has given a bond with
himself as surety that he will appear in
court when called upon. But Judge
Groezinger had been told the men were
innocent, and had been told by their own
attorney, too. so he dispensed even with
the formality of securing their signa
tures; he had them released on a simple
order of court.
. "Of course they were going to the
butchers' picnic." said Wittman, when
he emptied the vials of his wrath on the
learned Judge; "and what do you sup
pose they were going to do over at the
butchers 1 picnic? I heard some of them
went over * anyway, and I have reports
that two of them were working on Mar
ket street not two hours after they had
been released. And what recognizance
can a vagrant put up? We don't arrest
decent People and charge them with vag
rancy- .v- The char itself should have
Known they ought to have been held."
One of the men who was released on his
own recognizance had $123 in his pockets
wh eh he was not asked to leave as se
curity for his return. He was one of those
who had the luck to strike the Judge af
ter he had decided to be liberal. Why this
money was not held for bail Is what the
police are asking. Why was it that Groe
zinger asked first only half as much bail
as Judge Graham asked, and after letting
three of the men go for $50 apiece sud
denly come down to a basis of honor
with men who were charged with being
all out of that interesting commodity?
He "didn't know the police wanted
them, and "Mack told him they were
innocent," were the two pleas in extenua
tion, and they were all the Judge could
offer. Nearly as sound a basis as that
which gave to the world that wonderful
decision by the same learned Judge de
claring unconstitutional a valid ordinance.
The prayer of the police is that the good
Lord will take Groezinger back to his own
courtroom and away from the Police
Courts.
The men arrested gave these names:
James Glllespie. J. Evans. John Handy
James Fragky, J. W. Simpson, B. Frank
lin. William Golden, John Hall. John Rey
nolds and B. Golden. The occupations
they gave were as numerous as their
names.
Late last evening tho prison-keeper was
pUasod to see two of his former prisoners
come in again. The officers had captured
I. Golden and Simpson again and had
,-irrested them on bench warrants which
the learned Judge Croc-zinger had hur
riedly issued on ;hr demand of the police
Probably the happiest man in the
â world is the one who has just invested
in his first wedding ring.

THE FUSE IS
OF FOREIGN
MANUFACTURE
Experts Testify in the
Pinole Case.
FORCING FOUL PLAY THEORY
SPANISH SPY STORY IS BEING
STRENGTHENED.
More Evidence Is xet to Come Which
May Besult in a Decision of the
Suit on This Point
Alone.
More evidence to prove that the destruc
tion of the California Powder Works in
July last was caused by the act of either
a traitor or a Spanish spy was admitted
by Judge Daingerfleld yesterday in the
case of James B. Anders against the cor
poration owning the works. Anders seeks
to recover damages for personal injuries
sustained through the explosion and the
corporation is laboring to prove that the
"fatal accident" was not an accident, but
the result, of extraneous intluences which
the company could not control, the "ex
traneous influences" meaning the act of
a traitor or a Spanish spy who wished 10
deprive the Government of the powder
then under course of manufacture.
As published in yesterday's Call, short
ly after the accident a piece of fuse was
found near the scene of the explosion, the
barbed wire fence was found cut, foot
prints led to the location of the nitro
glycerine house; and these facts, taken
in connection with the appearance of a
stranger of Spanish appearance around
the works, led the managers and authori
ties to believe that foul play caused the
fatal explosion. Yesterday a number of
experts, including Mr. Bermingham, were
put on the stand to prove that the re
moval of debris after the first minor ex
plosion was the proper course to pursue
and also to prove that the material re
maining in the slum tubs, which caused
the disaster, was not explosive under or
dinary conditions and could only be set
off under extraordinary circumstances.
This matter disposed of, experts were
called to prove that the fuse found shortly
after the explosion was not manufactured
in California. This could be determined
by the amount and quality of cloth used
in the manufacture of the fuse, the size
of the bore and manner of manufacture.
Samuel J. Eva was first called and after
an examination of the fuse said that in
his opoinion the fuse was of foreign man
ufacture. James B. Merritt, another fuse
expert, was called and gave the Bame
opinion, stating that the exhibit must
have been imported or brought here by a
foreigner, as no such article was manu
factured on this coast. Experts from the
Western Fuse and Explosives Company
will testify to the same fact and these
opinions are largely depended upon to
convince the jury that "extraneous In
fluences" indeed caused the terrible catas
trophe.
Mr. Rermingham '=ald yesterday after
noon that some days before the explosion
he was informed that the stranger ac
-1 used of having applied the match to the
wi-rks was loitering in the vicinity. He
wt.nt out around the grounds, located him
and advised him to leave the place if he
wanted to keep out of trouble. The
stranger caught the next train and ieft
the works, but the day before the explu
sion he again appeared. The explosion
occurred and he has not since been seen,
notwithstanding that a number of oiu
cers have been searching for him since
that date. Mr. Bermingham says that ap
plication was made to the Government for
a guard for the plant, but as the grounds
are large and the number of men neces
sary to properly protect them was pnat
the Government was slow to consider the
matter and the destruction of the plant
and loss of life were the consequences of
the delay. Before the trial is concluded
more evidence will be produced tendlncr
to establish the contention that the works
were blown up by a stranger, and if such
is proved then the suit of Anders must
necessarily fall.
MANY CHANGES
MADE IN THE
CUSTOM-HOUSE
Smith and Linck Were
Blessings.
The Secretary of the Treasury has
granted all the requests made by Special
Agents Smith and Linck, who recently
overhauled affairs in the Custom-house
and made themselves thoroughly ac
quainted with all its needs. The Secre
tary's desires in the matter were commu
nicated to Port Collector Jackson In a
letter yesterday by which the following
changes are made:
Customs Inspector C. T. Cook to b"<?
made a clerk for the Surveyor at a Bul
; ary of $1500 per annum. The following
1 clerks' salaries have been increased: C
: L. Brown, $1600 to $1800; C. L. Marple, $14Â»x>
to $1600; Francis V. Leach. $1200 to $1400;
Thomas J. Harry, $1200 to $14*; A. L. Ri
-1 ley. $840 to $1000. Tho positions of C. J.
â â  Hundley, formerly <n the Appraisers
1 Ftore, and J. P. Riley, opener and pa< -k> i ,
j are discontinued. A. C. Buckbee, opener
I and packer, is made elevator conductor
at the same salary, $X4<); one clej-k in the
i liquidating department, to bo designated
I by the Collector, is to be discontinued.
The Custom-house must hereafter re
! main open from 9 a. m. until 4 p. m., in
, Ftead of from ft to 3, as heretofore. All
prnoklng by employes of tobacco in any
form, as well as the smoking- of cigar
ettes and Manila rlg.irs. must be discon
tinued In the Custom-boose and Apprais
er's building. Storekeeper M. Ldpowitz
is to remain permanently in charge of ihe
bonded manufacturing warehouse and not
changed yearly, as h.is been the custom.
One Inspetftress In .he Immigration Hu
reau is to be dismissed. Assistant Weigh
ers Julius E. Pomeroy and Raymond H.
WUcox, now keeping books, are ordered
to duty as assistant weighers and the Col
lector is empowered to appoint two clerks
nt $1200 per annum; also a chemist at $1000
per annum. The Collector is also author
ized and requested to appoint fifteen ad
ditional Customs Inspectors for service
under Surveyor Spear in pursuance of
j the Surveyor's request heretofore made
i to the Secretary of tlie Treasury that the
growth of the commerce of San Francisco
! required that additional number of men.
This is the first report of any special
agent that did not recommend a decrease
of salaries.
Triumphs of Modern Engineering.
TheophilUÃ Tucker lectured before the
Socialist Labor party last night at Turk
street Temple on the "Triumphs of Mod
ern Engineering."
"Modern engineering," he said, "is do
ing wonders for the world never dreamed
of in the story of the 'Arabian Nights.'
It is the province of engineering science
to embellish the environment of the hu
man race. It takes in hand the cultiva
tion of the entire surface of the earth,
and modern engineers were thjj real re
, deemere of the human race."
THE SAN FBAINCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1899.
FAIR'S "WIDOW"
IS BARRED BY
JUDGE TRDUTT
Cannot Intervene in
the Son's Contest.
MATTER WILL BE APPEALED
SUPREME COUIIT MUST DECIDE
THE VARIOUS POINTS.
Mrs. Craven Is Shut Out by the
Statute of Limitations, but Other
Grounds Remain for
Contest.
Mrs. Nettie R. Craven, posing as the
widow of the late James G. Fair, has met
another defeat. Yesterday morning
Judge Troutt handed down a decision in
which he denied Mrs. Craven the right
to intervene in the contest of Charles L.
Fair to the will of his deceased father.
This is a serious matter with Mrs.
Craven, as it cuts her off from following
one of her strongest leads toward the
glittering millions of the deceased cap
italist's estate. Still she has other
grounds upon which she can fight for a
Bhare of the estate, and doubtless these
grounds will now be brought forward and
the battle fought to the bitter end. The
decision handed down by Judge Trouit
denying Mrs. Craven the right to inter
vene in the contest in full is as follows:
In the above-entitled estate an application
has been made to the court by Nettle 11.
Craven-Fair, as the surviving wife of James
G. Fair, deceased, for leave to file a petition in
Intervention. The object of the proposed In
tervention is to contest the decedent's will,
which was admitted to probate on the 16th
day of November, 1!>96.
No person, within one year after probate of
said will, contested the same, except Charles
L. Fair, a son of decedent. He filed his peti
tion on the lith day of November, 1*97, and
1 11 ti Sted FaM will and prayed fur revocation
of probate on certain grounds.
In the month of April, 1899, the eald Nettie
R. 1 "raven-Fair applied to the court, as afore
said, for leave to file a petition in interven
tion for the i>uri"'H.- of contesting said will
nnd obtaining a revocation of probate on the
same grounds as those specified in said Charles
1.. Fair's petition. Whereupon, by ,mW of
court, notice was served upon the respective
attorneys for the executors of said will and for
the children of decedent requiring them, at a
certain time, to show oausu. if any they had.
why said petition in intervention should not
be filed.
The applicant first claims that Fertinn 357
of the Code of Civil Procedure, concerning the
rierht of intervention, is made applicable to
will contests by virtue of section 1713 of said
rode. The latter section reads as follows:

"Kxeept as otherwise provided in this title,
the provisions of part II of this code are ap
plicable to and constitute the rules of practice
in the proceedings mentioned in this title."
Title XI of nart 111 is the one in which said
section 1713 is found, and it is entitled "Of
proceedings in Probate Courts." Said section
357 is included in part II and provides that
"any person may, before the trial, intervene
in an action or proceeding who has an inter
est in the matter in litigation, in the success
of either of the parties or an interest against
both. An intervention takes place when a
third person is permitted to become a party
to an action or pmrpedlng between other per
sons, either by joining Hip plaintiff In claim
ing what is sought by the complaint or hy
uniting with the defendant in resisting the
claims of the plaintiff, or by demanding any
thing adversely to both the plaintiff and the
defendant, and is made by complaint setting
f'rth the grounds upon which the intervention
rests, filed by leave of the court and served
upon the parties to the action or proceeding
who have not appeared, and upon the attorneys
of the parties who have appeared, who may
answer or demur to it as if it were an original
complaint."
Notwithstanding the very ingenious argu
ment of applicant's counsel, it is quite clear
to my mind that the aforesaid section 387 of
the fode of Procedure does not apply to
a probate proceeding wherein a will is con
tested either before or after its probate, for
the simple reason that it is virtually other

code. By the two sections last cited any in- i
terested person who may desire to contest a !
will, either before or after probate, is lirected i
how to proceed, and is limited to one year I
after probate within whlrh to contest the Fame j
and to obtain a revocation of the probate ]
thereof. Kvidently. if the applicant were per
mitted to become a contestant of the will af
ter the lapse of a year from the probate there- |
of, under the Kulse of an intervenor, then the ;
aforesaid limitation of the statute respecting :
the time within which a person may contest j
a will after its probate, would be nullified, and
the statute In effect, would be indirectly re- '
pealed.
Petitioner further contends that section 1333 !
of the aforesaid code, when properly construed
in conjunction with the aforesaid section \3XI,
gives the right to any interested person (.with
out resort to intervention) to contest a will,
even after a year from its probate, provided
any other person has, within the year, taken :
the necessary steps to contest the will.
The aforesaid section 1333 declares that "if !
no person within one year after the probate
of a will, contest the same or the validity i
thereof, the probate of the will is conclusive;
savins to infants and persons of unsound mind,
a like period of one year after their respective i
disabilities are removed."
This contention of petitioner means, of
course, that the person who is thus permitted
to conest a will after a year from its pro
bate, may rely upon any of the statutory
grounds of opposition to the will, whether ;
ursed by the original contestant or not. Our j

Supreme Court, however, has determined that
the grounds of contest cannot he amended af
ter the lapse of the year limited for the in
stitution of a contest, so as to add a new
ground of contest. (In re Wilson. 117 Cal.,
262.) Hence this contention cannot be main
tained.
The said section 1333 apparently means that
if any person within one year after the pro
bate of a will, contests the same, then the
probate thereof is not conclusive until such
contest fails. It certainly does not confer a
right on any other perso nto begin a contest
of the will after a year from the probate
thereof.
It is, therefore, my opinion that the ap
plicant is not entitled to file a petition in in
tervention and that she is too late to be per
mitted to contest the validity of the aforesaid
will or the probate thereof.
The petitioner's aforesaid application is ac
cordingly denied.
Notwithstanding the opinion of the
court it is said that an appeal will be
taken and the right of the petitioner to
intervene finally determined. If the Su
preme Court holds that Judge Troutfs
decision should he sustained then the ap
plication of Mrs. Craven for a family al
lowance from decedent's estate will be
prosecuted to a final decision. Mrs.
Craven has met several adverse decisions,
but she has not yet lost hope, and a mer

PROBABLY A MURDER.
Kemains of an Unknown Female In-
fant, Entirely Nude, Found
Floating in the Bay.
The nude body of an unknown female
infant was found floating in the bay y. s
terday near the gas works at North
Point. The remains were very much de
composed, and when examined at the
Morgue it was asc< rtalned that the child
was about a week old at the time of its
death. The body had been in the v
so long that all evidences of murder had
been removed (assuming that a murder
had been committed). If the child had
died a natural death and its parents wi r<
too poor to provide for ita burial they
would have notified the Coroner and had
the remains interred by the city under
taker. Or if the parents wished to con
ceal -their Identity they would hu\ â 
posited tht.- body on some vacant lot
where it would lie f"iind.
The fact that the body was thrown into
the water leads very directly to the sus
picion that the infant was murdered.

FOR the first time in the history Of ]
the Baptist National Society an
niversary week is being celebrated
west of the Rockies. Distance has |
proved no obstacle to the zealous !
Baptist, and the convention now In |
session here has brought together many j
ardent workers from all parts o the
United States.
The organizations represented are the I
American Baptist Education Society, the
American Baptist Publication Society, the
American Baptist Missionary Union and
the American Baptist Home Mission So
ciety.
The First Baptist Church, where the
convention is being held, is bright with
fragrant blossoms. Lilies and roses vie j
with one another to make the altar beau- j
tifiil and cordons of cool green ferns lend
a finishing touch to the artistic ensem- ,
Mr
To the Women's Baptist Home Mission j
Society was accorded the honor of first j
place on the week's programme and the
mission meeting occupied all the yes
terday morning and afternoon session.
The ladies interested in the boundless
benevok-nce of the mission work have not
allowed the spiritual to completely over
shadow the material. The officers on the
platform, the f-peakers and the large and
interested audience resent made a strik
ing picture in their modish gowns and
swell bonnets. Many, according to East
t-rn custom, chanced at noon the sub
dued morning gown for the more lab
orate dress fashion sanctions for the
afternoon.
At 9 a. m. the day's work began with
a praiso and prayer service led by Mrs.
Ft E. Manning of Illinois. The address
of welcome was made by Mrs. J. Sunder
land. president of the Women's Baptist
Home Mission Society of California. In
the name of the California society and
the great Baptist sisterhood of the coast
she bade the officers and representatives
welcome.
At the conclusion of her address Mrs.
Sunderland presented each of the officers
with a beautiful bouquet of orchids and
ferns. "The fragrance and beauty of
these." said she. "is emblematical of the
fragrance and beauty of your work. But
the flowers will fade, while your work is
immortal."
Mrs. .i. N. Crouse of Chicago, president
of the r..-sociation. then responded on be
half of her sister offW-ers to Mrs. Sun
derland's welcome and read an Interest
ing papÂ»-r on "The Needs of the Society."
I long other things Mrs. Crouse said:
We need one and all a keener apprecia
in of the times in which we live. Ali
rne?t and thinking minds feel and know
ct the .v hale Anglo-Saxon race has
wakened to a new consciousness of the
j-her meaning of life. All consecrated
iristian workers recognize the hand of
id moving unmistakably In the events of.
We: -1- a nation are being tested in the
â¢ry furnace of successful enterprise.
While on a visit to Berlin, a few years
:o, a â  end and I were asked by one of
trmany's most influential women if we
nuld allow her to give us a reception. "1 j
ant the women of Germany to see what
nd of women America sends forth. Your
r.men arc the hope of the rare," said she.
The elevation of the nation must come
through homes. The homes are the founda
-m stones of all civilisation. In so tar as
<t homes of a people are true and pure and
frht In the eyes of God. does that nation
â osper and rise in dimity and worth,
hurrhes and schools ami other organized
stitutlons are indispensable to a nation's
Â.-osperlty.
Twenty-two years ago we were organ
ised for the purpose of elevating and
Christianizing the homes of God's neg
lected ones, and for twenty-two years we
have held steadfastly to our rurr<ose. slow
ly but steadily paining ground, and almost
as slowly ami Just as steadily improving
our methods.
Instead of a handful of honie-making
missionaries, scattered here and there on
our almost churchless plains and plateaus,
hundreds of surh are needed. What is It
the tired, overworked woman on the Ne
braska and Dakota farms, the Montana and
Colorado ranches, the New Mexico and Ari
zona plains nped most?
They need to learn that they, with the
help of God, can transform the rude wooden
hut or low adobe house into a paradise of
love and sympathy.- More than that, they
can become the choice garden spots where
souls are nurtured for Christ and this
cause. â :,..:.
The home pioneer women of our great
West need to remember that their husbands
and children must not have only outer sun
shine, hut inner sunshine. If this spiritual
side of home life can be emphasized and
made a real part of these women's lives.
sad faces and tired eyes will vanish and
the much lamented drudgery will become
great, glorious work for God and human
itj".
The swinging open of the door of the
twentieth century swings open another
doorâ Cuba and Porto Rico are ours now;
ours to succor, to help and to upbuild. A
score or more of trained, intelligent, conse
crated, home-making missionaries ought to
be sent to these beautiful lands with the
coming yearâ our gladness offering to the
great new century. Cubans of all classes j
understand that we have: come to Cuba to
help them and they welcome us. And yet
we must not turn our backs upon poor,
benighted. priest-ridden MÂ«xiro. She is
holding out her handÂ« pleadingly to us.
Time forbids that I si, Alld -!'â !' to dwell ]
upon the hope and encouragement and en
lightenment which will come to this sorely
oppressed 'ountry when Mexican women
awake to the glad tidings {hat they are the
handmaidens of the Lord.
In conclusion, Mrs. ('rouse said:
"J,et not the picture I have drawn of
the pressing need of enlarging our work
dismay or dishearten you. All things are
possible to him who believes and works.
Let us consider it rather as a great new
opportunity for us to show ourselves to
be In very truth the Daughters of the
King. Let us press forward unflinchingly,
unfaltering, knowing the great irresisti
ble power of God himsf If is with us. "
Miss Mary G. Burdette, corresponding
secretary of the society, followed with a
paper on the spread of the Gospel and the
promotion of missionary work. She read
the following extracts from the annual
report:
The total cash receipts for the year were
*â¢'â "â  ;- 95; this, with Â»:m â¢â â  cash In the
treasury at the beginning of the year and
12000 since borrowed, makes a total of' $68 -
639 39 Which hag passed through the treas
urer's hands. The disbursements were
$C 6.460 69, and the books closed with $173 70
cash on hand.
Of $4385 44 in the treasury at the be
ginning of the year, the $3700 mentioned
in the treasurer s report last year as lia
bilities, was borrowed money, which ow
ing to continued stringency, your hoard
was compelled to carry into the year
This, with the $2000 subsequently borrowed'
and an unpaid bill of $1672 88 for printing'
makes a total of . $7372 88. Deducting thÂ«
$173 70 cash on hand, leaves an apparent
deficit of 17145 88. But as $2500 of the I
amount reported as borrowed money has
been given to the society to he used at
discretion, it can be applied on the deficit
thus reducing it' to $416.) 46. ' -

i .In response to a continued ? call for spe

decided, with the approval of tne society
as represented at the annual meeting held
In Rochester last May. to assign to the
young women and older girls the raising
of $3000 for the purchase of property in

sion?,' as will be evident from the follow
ing action, taken by a unanimous vote
of that body at the regular meeting held
ADTiI 4, I* I :, a few days after the close
of the fiscal year. In one sense, such ac
tion belongs to the records of the next
year, but it seems fitting to incorporate
It in this report. It reads an follows:
"Realizing the great possibilities for
Christian work In Cuba and Porto Rico, and
Impressed also with the grave responsi
bility resting upon Christians of the United
States to enter upon this work. It Is the
desire and Intention of the Woman's Bap
tist-Home Mission Society to extend It*

that the bets! results will be accomplished
by the close and cordial co-operatloii of the
home mission societies operating there, the
board of the Woman's Baptist Home Mis
sion Society hereby expresses Its willing
ness to become responsible, under existing
conditions, for the support of qualified
women missionaries, approved and appoint
Â»d by the. board of the American Baptist
Home Mission Society, within the limits
of financial ability '
After Miss Burdettes report came an
impressive feature of the meeting, the
introduction of seven active missionary
Miss Ida May Egll told of her work In
the Chinese mission school and kinder
garten in San Francisco, and was fol
lowed by Mis* Abbie C. Ross, a worker
â in the same field. Miss Lips .1. Rag-
Btrome of Oakland, Miss Babrina Erick-
Bon of bos Angeles and Miss Hulda l^nf
gren of San Francisco recited their ex-
I perlence in working among the Swedes.
Miss Julia K. Pennoyer. general mission
ary for California, and Miss Rose J.
Clark general missionary for Colorado,
also spoke of what is being done in their
MVP localities.
"In a nutshell" five minute talks by I
representative women opened the after- ,
njoon session. Mrs. J. J. Croum of Utah
had this to say concerning her work:
"It does not take very long to tell of
the work in I'tah, for there are hardly
500 Baptists in Utah, but there is much to

toll of the needs of Utah. One of the
groat mistakes we have made as a re
i liÃious body mming West is that we
have not left our literature hehind."
Mrs. Jacks of Southern California fol
lowed. Shr brought greetinK from the
southland, nnd told of the work in the;
field in which she labored.
Exercises by the Chinese children of
the mission school, led by their teacher,
Mips Martha J. Ames, pleasantly inter
; rupted the routine. They were followed |
by some- music, after which Mrs. W. E.
' Wamsley of New York read an excellent
! paper on "How to Interest Children and
Why." Among other things Mrs. Wams
ley had this to say:
"Why interest the children? First for
; their own sake. The information will be
useful and broadening, but the training
received will be far more useful. A child
can DO more be educated to a life of re
i ligion and faith without the exercise of
personal activity than heroic deeds can
Ibe accomplished with words only. We
need the children's co-operation. We
want them to be ready to take our places
and carry on the work we have begun."
After Mrs. Wamsley had disposed of
the children question Mrs. John H. Chap
man delivered an address on "The Mis
sion of the Women's Baptist Home Mis
sion Society." In the course of an elo- ;
quent paper Mrs. Chapman thus appealed
i to the women:
"Women of God. we must save the
' homes. There has been much written and
said in this age of progress about the
elevation of woman. There have been
women, there are women, who are clam
-1 oring for the ballot and for an equal
I footing with the men; women who covet;
! man's privilege and power; women who j
j ape his dress and imitate his manner. ;
; I am not here to speak a word of censure i
to su< h as these, but I am here to point;
out to you as women a place of power and j
honor that God has reserved for you;
alone, a place so high and sacred that to
change to any other sphere must be to i
t;ik. ;i lower place. If home be a type [
of heaven, then woman must make it so;
if it be the fountain head of our natural
life, then the waters will be bitter or
sweet as woman wills."
Miss Jennie ].. Peck, who has been la- ]
boring with the colored women in Texas, '
followed Mrs. Chapman and told of her j
work and grand results in the field of the j
colored woman. Miss Mina S. Everett, !
who has been doing missionary work in
New Mexico, called her paper "Mexico's;
I Millions.'
Miss Isabel A. H. Crawford of Okla- j
homa Territory was the last speaker on
the afternoon programme. She told of
her t xp< rlence in the Indian Territories,
nnd Bhowed how the missionaries had
: finally won the confidence of the noble j
red man by love, kindness and forbear- i
anci'.
The church was Ihronged during the
; evening session with an appreciative au
dience. The various speakers were ap
â¢ plauded aa they told of the growth of
Baptist Institutionts of learning.
In the absence of Rev. J. B. (iambrel
the Rev. Kerr Boyce Tupper, pastor of
the First Baptist church, Philadelphia,
was the principal speaker. He chose for
his theme "A Plea for Christian and De
nominational Education." He presented
â  many facts respecting Baptist institutions
of i> arning. 1 1<- said:
The denomination has Beven theological
seminaries with 1200 students; twenty-nine
v men colleges with 4O('O studpnts. thirty
three schools for negroes and Indians;
thirty colleges and universities with 12,
--000 students, and sixty-four academies and
schools with 18,000 students. It has $36,
--, 000.000 invested funds.
. These schools must be made distinctively
Christian. Students must be taught Bible,
authority. Every professor who is in op
position to, or silent â  about, divine truth
must be banished, as he sows seed of
infidelity in the hearts of student*, In
tellect is a desirable qualification, but spirit .
is better. With the manly mind must also
be associated the sovereign soul. Without
Bplrltual life in the educated young men ;
their genius will be but a fatal gift; their
talent* a glittering sham; their eloquence, a
hollow unveraclty. We must lift the whole .
personality of college life until It glows in
the brightness and beauty of the sky.
The Bible Should be taught in Baptist col- â 
lege.* It Ib the fullest and richest thesaurus
.if wisdom and knowledge. No such poetry
as here, nor philosophy, nor history, nor
biography, nor morality. It Is above all: or
â¢ the. books that fill our libraries and thrill
our hearts. Our students are ignorant of
this sunlimest work or God. We must de
mand that In connection with the mastery
of art and science and literature our edu
cated youth have their souls attuned to
the music of eternal principles..

has figured as a possibi '*â¢ for a

fuel has been added to the tlames
and he has come more prominently
forward as a proposed candidate for

although they may have earned his
thanks. He wants nothing the
voters can give him, and he hesi
tates to have his military record
made the basis of a political one.
In a letter to Captain Frank War
ren, who commanded Company H of
the First regiment, and was a close
friend of the then colonel, Smith
writes that he will not run for of
fice, and that he wishes his friends
to understand that plainly. In his
letter he wrote as follows:
You may say for me that I am
out of politics and that I propose
to stay out. This is my fixed de
termination and no friend of mine
knowing it will do me the dis
courtesy of showing his disbelief
by urging me as a candidate for
any political office. I entered the
service from a sense of duty. I
am entitled to no reward for it

Howell.
The chief object of the convention was
to discuss a memorial to be presented to
the American Baptist Educational So
ciety. This memorial, prepared by a com
mittee some months since, was read by
the Rev. T. <5. Brownson. It was intend
itl to outline a comprehensive plan of
campaign to promote unity of spirit and
effori in the denomination and in harmony
with existing societies to further the vari
ous mutual and common interests, es
pecially the planting and maintaining: of
Christian schools.
It was apparent from the start that
there was a decided difference of opinion.
After two hours of fruitless discussion
the Questions involved were submitted to
a Bpeclal committee to report back at a
meeting to be called later on. The cMef
objection raised to the report was that
H provided for work to be done twenty
five or fifty years hence. It was the con
sensus of opinion that the most should
be made of the educational facilities now
at hand.
The reading of the paper prepared by
the Rev. Dr. Blackburn of Oregon on
"Our Need of a Theological Seminary on
the Coast" was postponed until to-day. It
will be read at the meeting of the Bap
tist Educational Society.
The Rev. E. R. Bennett spoke briefly
on the question. Is the demand for a the
ological seminary on this coast sufficient
to justify and to rTemand earnest organ
ized effort to establish and maintain such
a school? He held there was a pressing
need for the school. The distance from
educational centers makes it seem im
practicable for young men to secure such
preparation for the ministvv. as thfy real
ize what is demanded by *he importance
of the work. Partly owing to this there
are few Baptist young men entering the
ministry. Only one or two graduates from
the University of California in the past
thirty years, one Congregationalist and
two or three Methodists. In California
there are 200 Baptist churches, with about
100 pastors, only thirty of whom have en
joyed a seminary training. With a well
located seminary as the center of de
nominational teaching, activity and life,
better counsels would have prevailed and
activities would have been unified. I sug
gest we plant our seminary at the seat
of the University of California and to
enter into some form of co-operation witb
and claim none, except the per
sonal satisfaction of being able to
say my service was not from sel
fish motives. Moreover, I now en
joy the friendship and good will
of all. It is pleasant to me to feel
that I have that friendship and
good will, and I will not permit
that feeling to be imperiled by
the bitter controversies incident
to a campaign for public office.
Any fame won by the regiment
belongs to it, not to me.
It is a clear, straightforward de
rision of a man who knows his own
mind and the ways of politicians.
General Smith can gain no higher
distinction in politics than he has
gained in the volunteer service, and
he values the one too highly to risk
it in pursuit of the other. He may
lose as a candidate, but he has not
lost as a man.
that institution. The officers of the uni
versity are friendly to the idea, another
denomination is already there and at
work and a second will open its school
there next year. A strong point in favor
of this plan is its feasibility. By avail
ing ourselves of the free instruction of
the branches taught by the university
we may be able to open the seminary and
do good work, with two good men in the
faculty or with but one for a time. The
time seems ripe to move in this matter.
Support can surely be secured from the
I large Held presented here. In addition
I to the advantages named for the plan,
there is this other consideration. It will
surround the great university with a cor
don of theological schools, which will go
a long way toward fixing the attitude of
. that school us hostile or friendly to evan-
g elical religion.
Officers for the ensuing year were
elected as follows:
President. T. G. Brownson. D. D.; re
i cording secretary, J. H. Garnett; corre-

SMALLPOX CASE
REPORTED TO
HEALTH OFFICE
Little Cause to Fear
Contagion.
ISOLATION OF THE PATIENT
VICTIM IS ROY WINCHESTER, A
STENOGRAPHER.
Dr. O'Brien Says the Case Is Prob
ably Sporadic and That All Proper
Precautions Have Seen
Taken.
A case of smallpox was discovered Mon
day in the house a( ."77 Ellis street and
wa? reported to the Health Office by Dr.
William A. Harvey. The patient is Roy
Winchester, a stenographer in the em
ploy #f Hobbs, Wall & Co.. As soon as
the nature of the disease was determined
the patient was redaoved to the Mac Lean
Hospital on Douglass street, from which
place be was again nmnved to a cottage
on Caselli avenue, where both patient
and nurses will be isolated until the dis
ease has run its course. The house
where Winchester was living at the tim-j
he was stricken with the disease has
been thoroughly fumigated and dis
infected under the direction of officers of
the Health Department; the same course
has been pursued at the Mac Lean Hos
pital.
"I have made a thorough study of the
case and its history," said Health Officer
O'Brien yesterday, "and I have found
nothing to cause me to fear an epidemic.
It is a case of variola, or confluent small
pox, and is, so far as I am able to ascer
tain, sporadic: that is to say. it is not
due to contagion. The patient had not
visited the water front or the Presidio,
and has not been in any of the places
where it would be possible for him to
have become infected with the germs of
the disease from any known source. Dr.
Harvey very properly reported the case
to the Health Department as soon as it
had become sufficiently developed to
arouse suspicion as to its virulent nature.
This has enabled us to take all proper
precautions to isolate the patient and pre
vent the spread of the disease by con
tagion."
KILLED BY A DOCTOR.
Mrs. Lucy Lahl Died From the Effects
of a Criminal Operation at Hands
of an Unknown Person.
Mrs. Lucy Lahl. a bride of ten months
i and only 17 years old, came to
I her death yesterday morning at the hands
jof some unscrupulous physician, name
I and whereabouts unknown.
Coroner Hill was notified yesterday by
j Dr. C. A. Glover that the young woman's
; death was from peritonitis, and that
i therefore it was a matter for investiga
tion by the Coroner. Dr. Glover said that
he had been called to attend the woman
I shortly before she died, and had discov
ered certain suspicious facts which im
gelled him to report the case. Autopsy
urgeon Zabala held an autopsy on the
body at the undertaking establishment
and found that trie deceased came to her
death because of a criminal operation by
some person unknown. An inquest will
be held this afternoon.
j MtOB ijatii was Miss Waldo**. " T^"
1 months ago she clandestinely married a
j car conductor named Lahl, who lived with
] her a while and then left the city. He
I is now believed to be in Los Angeles.
| The Coroner has obtained a clew which
! may lead to the discovery of the guilty
I physician. .
As a Warning to Others.
Joseph Goldstein, a messenger hoy in
the employment of the District Telegraph
Company, was sentenced to thirty days
in the County Jail by Judge Mogan yea
terday on the charge of petty larceny.
May 19 he was sent with a letter con
taining $10 to a Mr. Levy in a downtown
hotel, and h<- abstracted the money and
spent it on drink. ThÂ» Judgo said he
would sentence him as a warning to other
messenger boys to be honest.
Advances made nn furniture and pianos, with
or without removal. .1. Noonan, 1017-1023 Mission.
In the Divorce Court.
Mary B. Kenney was granted a divorce
from John B. Kenney yesterday on the
ground of Infidelity. Charles H. Walker
was granted a divorce from Annie Walk
er by Judge Daingerfield on the ground
of desertion. Suits for divorce have been
filed by Alire L. Ingram against Robert
H. Ingram for failure to provide. George
C. Bates against Margarita Bates for in
fidelity and Cora Shoaff against "Walter
Shoaft" for failure to provide.
Board Must Appear.
Judge Hunt yesterday ordered an order
to show cause to be served on the Board
of Education commanding that body to
appear on June 2 and explain the reascin
why the demands of E. C. Kllpatrick for
a year's salary have not been paid. A pre
vious ordt-r was dismissed, but it seems
that the matter will now be finally de
termined.

THE PANHANDLE EXTENSION.
THE extension of the panhandle to Market
street seems to be practically assured. At first
there was a latent fear, expressed in some quar
ters, that it would simply furnish a lengthened drive
way for opulent citizens at the expense of the com
munity. But it is now clearly understood that, of all
classes of our people, they will derive the least bene
fit from the improvement. The chief arguments in
its favor, which arc generally comprehended, are that
it will beautify a large and interesting section of our
territory, principally occupied by residences; that it
will be a connecting link between the mass of our
population and one of the finest resorts in the world,
and that it will so diffuse the knowledge of our artis
tic civilization as to raise San Francisco on this con
tinent to the same commanding position that Paris
occupies in Europe.
There is hardly a person of any nationality, sex or
age in this city who has not visited Golden Gate
Park, and yet there are very few who have an ade
quate conception of us extent or of how greatly and
symmetrically it has been developed within twenty
six or twenty-seven years. The site alone, which em
braces 1004 acres, stretching for four miles from the
Baker-street entrance to the ocean beach, is worth 'â 
probably a couple of millions of dollars. The diver
sified cultivation of two-thirds of this area, now com- j
pletely recovered from its natural bleakness, with
such embellishments as the conservatories, the
aviary, the museum, the playhouse for children and j
other ornamental structures too numerous to men
tion, represent a much greater value. It may soon be
within our power to give a closely approximated es
timate of the total amount of this beneficent and
profitable investment. But it is tolerably safe to as
sume that the sum total will not be less than from
six to eight millions. The public has had a full
equivalent for every dollar that has been employed
to create this magnificent landscape on the verge of
the continent and by the side of the almost bound
less stretch of the Pacific.
The larger gifts that have been made for the bene
fit of the park by wealthy men, who have perceived its
sanitary, its intellectual and its moral influence upon
the city and upon the State, have been repeatedly de
scribed in the press. But it is not generally known
that in each year a constant stream of lesser but use
ful and ornamental donations is poured into the avail
able resources of the Commissioners. In the
Memorial Museum alone, which during its brief ex
istence has been visited by a million and a half of
people, a few months ago there were 41.585 separate
articles, all of them attractive and many of them
costly and magnificent. In the last report of the
Park Commissioners five pages of print arc filled
with the list of presentations in twelve months, and
three pages with our own contributions of plants and
Rowers to various institutions in the State. In the
year that ended July 1, 1897, the disbursements for the
park, every item of which is accounted for, aggre
gated $249/160 55.
The extension of the panhandle is absolutely es
sential to a perfect connection between the park and
the crowded thoroughfares of this metropolis. Its
cost will be a bagatelle compared with the imme
diate benefits that it will secure, not merely those
which cannot be computed in dollars, but in addi
tions to property values. It was roughly guessed,
when The Call first advocated this plan for the gen
eral welfare, that the property to be condemned, as
sessed at $1,600,000, would involve a public charge of
three millions and a half. The prospect is that the
more detailed work now in progress will show a
considerable reduction in these figures. The imme
diate and visible profit will more than balance the ex
penditure.
Aguinaldo seems to have as many capitals as all the
I'nucd State's, and surrenders them one after another
with as much indifference as some of our State capi
tals are surrendered to Colonel Mazuma.
The Market Street Railway Company seems to have
come to the conclusion that all of its troubles are in a
bottle and can be pulled out only by something in
the nature of a corkscrew franchise.
Victoria undoubtedly merits congratulation on her
birthday, but at the same time it is hardly to her
cirdit that she has lived eighty years without ever
trying to do justice to Ireland.
The Kaiser's declaration of a hope that the Peace
Conference will reach conclusion: that "will satisfy
the Czar" sounds well, but it doesn't promise much.
MORE COOLIES FOR HAWAII.
THE latest news from Hawaii is in further con
firmation of The Call's contention. We quoted
President Dole and other island authorities, be
i fore annexation, to prove that they expected permis
sion to continue coolie contract labor there, and to
go on unrestrained in that respect. This was hotly
! denied by annexationists, and our home labor and its
1 employers were quieted by the assurance that our
labor laws would be extended tp the islands and that
| labor there and here would be put upon a perfect
equality as to wage scale, contracts, hours and all
| other things. The commission which went out to
measure Hawaii and cut and fit for it a garment of
government, after continuing the existing govern
, ruent in power until Congress should act, returned
! home and did nothing to get action by Congress, so
j that the islands have experienced no change in their
â  civil affairs, except that their public debt of several
millions has been paid out of the pockets of Ameri
; can taxpayers, and the expenses of their government
are borne by the citizens of this country. The im
; portation of coolie contract labor has gone on until
; coolies are more than half the population.
At a recent meeting of the Dole Cabinet the peti
â â  tion of four sugar planters for coolie labor, which had
been refused, was reconsidered and granted, and they
were permitted to import 531 1 "for the next period."
Action upon these petitions brought out the reason
for their rejection when first presented. The In
spector of Immigrants had reported that these plant
ers had ill treated their coolies, and they were for
! bidden any more until they promised to treat them
i better.
This is worthy of approval. The tens of thousands
of coolies in the islands who labor under the com
pulsion of a penal contract should have some protec
tion against abuse. This admission that abuses exist
and that there is personal, bodily, ill treatment of
these unfortunate and servile people marks in a
startling way the wide gulf between the Hawaiian
labor system and ours. Yet the two countries are
uiider the same flag and the same Government, which
is supposed to be one of absolute equality throughout
its jurisdiction.
The people of Hawaii are to be congratulated.
Their public expenses are paid by us. Their leading
products are now permanently on our free list, and
they enjoy the use of the cheapest labor in the world.
It is true that there rises beyond this sump
tuous picture of high prosperity for the few secured
b\ the use of servile labor a background that may be
viewed with apprehension by those who permit them
selves to look into the future. The American peo
ple control Congress, and when they discover that
they resemble the coolies in having no share in the
gilded scene, they may awake to the importance and
the possibilities of their own constitution and insist
that under it conditions shall be equal for all terri
tory that is under the flag. Then the alluring vision
that now charms the beholder in Hawaii will pass
away, and it will be again demonstrated that labor in
the tropics must be involuntary, compulsory, ser
vile, if there is to be any labor there at all.
This awakening will be promoted by another con
dition which no human ingenuity can avoid. If
coolie contract labor be unchecked in our tropical
territory, the condition of white labor at home will
gradually decline to the coolie level.
The Republican doctrine of protection has taught
this lesson to the American people, until it i> a per
manent part of the political faith of this country. If
that doctrine is sound when applied to cheap and
servile labor under other flags, it is equally sound
when applied to the same labor under our flag. It is
surprising that the annexation press is so silent on
j this subject. When The Call was predicting just
what has come to pass in Hawaii the annexation or
-1 gans were presenting the sugar plantations of Hawaii
; as a white man's paradise, never more to be polluted
by the footprint of a coolie. They attacked us for
warning the people of what would happen. Now
i that it has happened they are silent.
But the people are not blind. They are observers
of current events, and one day they will call for an
accounting.
TAMMANY AND MR. BRYAN.
SINCE the day the Chicago convention of 1896
nominated Bryan for the Presidency New York
Democracy has been disturbed, dissatisfied and
restless. If from the proverb, "A contented mind is
a continual feast," we may infer that a discontented
mind is continual hunger, then the Democrats of
New York are sufficiently famished and ravenous to
devour anything in sight, even to the extent of prac
ticing cannibalism upon one another.
About the only relief they find in their discontent
is to turn their restless activity to ceaseless efforts to
displace Bryan from the leadership of the Democratic
party and establish in the position a man who will
restore them to their former dominant authority in
national Democracy. To that end they have sought
candidate after candidate, beginning with Gorman of
Maryland, ranging far and wide and now returning to
him again.
A short time ago Amos J. Cummings presented
anew to the people of New York the claims of Gor
man upon the Democratic party and argued again
that he is the most available and most skillful leader
i the party could choose to direct it in the campaign of
1900. Mr. Cummings has so long been a member of
the inner councils of New York Democracy that it
cannot be doubted his utterances represent the pre
vailing sentiment of the controlling element of Demo
cratic circles in that State. It may therefore be ac
cepted as an evidence that something like a campaign
s of education is to be made on Gorman's behalf and
that from this time on it will be under his standard
the fight against Bryan will be made.
In the meantime the Nebraska man is not in the
least alarmed. Since his tumultuous reception at the
famous dollar dinner he has been more sanguine than
ever of his renomination, and has even persuaded
himself that New York Democrats will send delegates
to support him at the national convention. In fact,
he is reported to have said recently, "There are ten
silver Democrats in New York to every one in
Nebraska."
The silver leader is not without reason for the
hope that is in him. While the more eminent men of
his party are opposed to him, the rank and file ap
j pear to be steadfastly with him. Whenever a Demo
cratic convention meets there are sure to be more
cheers for Bryan than for any other Democrat, living
or dead. It will be remembered that when one of
the speakers at the dollar dinner declared Jefferson
to be the greatest Democrat that ever lived he was
checked with hisses and shouts of "Bryan! Bryan!"
That seems to be the temper of the rank and file of
the party almost everywhere.
A striking illustration of the survival of the Bryan
craze in the ranks of the Democratic party was given
ir the platform recently adopted by a Democratic
convention in Maine which had assembled to nomi
nate a Congressman to succeed the late Nelson
I Dingley. Of course they knew they had no chance of
electing their man, but they gave a wild warwhoop
just the same, indorsed the Chicago platform and de

clared it contains '"principles which were triumphed
over by 'McKinleyism,' which has given the country
brutal political bossism, relentless and grasping trust
isni, blatant Eaganism, criminal Algerism and rotten
beefismâ in a word, unadulterated, unreasoning and
detestable modern Republicanism and bold and un-
American imperialism."
That is the style of talk which arouses Democracy
in this day and generation. Tammany is of course a
strong organization, and Gorman is a leader of many
resources, but it is not likely that both combined can
baffle the rank and file of the party, bent upon re
peating the folly of 1896 and determined to be Bryan
ites first, last and all the time.
VICTORIA'S EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY.
AFTER a reign which for length of time and for
good fortune has been unparalleled in the an
nals of history, Victoria, Queen of Great
Britain and Ireland and Empress of India, has come
to her eightieth year and has seen her birthday cele
brated with exultant rejoicing at home and observed
with honor throughout the civilized world.
Her life when summed up and compared with the
general lives of men and women seems to approach
very near the acme of human felicity. She was dow
ered in her cradle with almost every conceivable
good gift. The blood within her little veins was
wholesome and full of vitality. She had the highest
fortune, so far as wealth, rank and dominion go,
which the earth affords. Nature endowed her with a
serene temper and clear common sense. She grew up
to possess sufficient beauty to be pleasin-g, but not
enough to tempt her into vanity or coquetry. She
married her first love, and their wedded lives were
happy. She had many children and saw nearly all
of them reach maturity in health and vigor. She
was surrounded by wise counselors and her empire
flourished and her people prospered to an extent sur
passing that ever dreamed of at the time she as
cended the throne.
Her personality \ias been a potent factor in
strengthening and advancing both the prosperity of
her people and the splendor of her kingdom. While
she was not in any sense a great woman, she has
been at every important point in her career a wise and
a good one. British loyalty and the flattery of courts
have of course concealed as far as possible such faults
as she has and such errors of mind or heart as she
may have committed in her career, but allowing all
that can be justly claimed on that score, the fact re
mains that the Queen has been perhaps the most ex
cellent woman that ever sat upon a throne.
She has been singularly happy also in her family.
She has had trials and tragedies and disgraces close
to her. and among those whom she loved, but con
sidering the temptations to which royalty is exposed
these have been comparatively few, not more, per
haps, than have afflicted private families whose mem
bership is anything like so extensive as her own. She
has fifty-six descendants. Five of her grandchildren
wear crowns, and among them the greatest crowns
of Europe.
It is difficult to imagine a more fortunate career,
unless we should eliminate from the imagined one all
human defects and all the risks that attend mortals
in this mutable world. Love and power and wealth,
length of years, prosperity, peace, honor, children
and their descendants to the third generation â all
these have been hers, and all were around her when
in good health and with an undisturbed heart she
celebrated her eightieth birthday. It is certainly a
notable life which Victoria is now rounding out into
a serene old age, and it is not strange that her people
scattered all over the globe rise up and call her
blessed.
COUNTY EXHIBITS AT STATE FAIR.
AN address issued by the State Board of Agri
culture to the Supervisors of the various
counties urging them to provide as far as pos
sible for a comprehensive county exhibit at the State
Fair gives encouragement to the hope that the fair
will be made what it was designed to be â a compre
hensive exposition of the resources, industries and
productions of all California.
The desirability of a thorough exposition of the
products of the State every year is not to be denied.
Such displays constitute something more than a pub
lic holiday. They afford a stimulus to industry by ex
citing emulation among men of all departments of in
dustry, while at the same time furnishing illustrations
of what can be accomplished in any particular line
of endeavor and providing instruction as to the
means of attaining it. The taxpayers provide a con
siderable sum of money for the maintenance of the
fair, and since they pay for it, a county which neglects
to take advantage of it is guilty of something like
folly.
The State Board of Agriculture has made every ar
rangement to give ample space for the desired ex
hibits. The address says: "A separate ' portion of
the exhibition pavilion will be set apart for these
county exhibits, which will be set up by the society
without expense, and a proper and qualified atten
dant will be put in charge who will present and ex
plain in detail to travelers and the general public. If
the county, or any Board of Trade, Immigration So
ciety or Chamber of Commerce organized within it
desire to supply any literature or printed matter for
distribution in connection with this display, it will be
distributed by the person in charge. If the county or
any county organization should desire to employ a
special attendant for its exhibit no objection will be
made."
The nature and the extent of each county exhibit
is of course left to the county itself to determine, and
so varied are the natural resources and the industries
of the different counties that if all enter the exposi
tion the display as a whole will be one of extraor
dinary interest and value. The State Fair is always
largely attended, but if a general county display were
to be made on a scale of sufficient magnitude to
worthily represent all California, it would be largely
increased and the resulting benefit to each competing
county greatly augmented.
The issue is before the Supervisors and the people
of each county. The Board of Agriculture is pre
pared and ready to do its share. If now a proper re
sponse be made from the counties, the State Fair this
year will give us a grand rehearsal of what California
will show at the Paris Exposition of 1900 and greatly
aid the making of that exhibit.
A vicious convict at San Quentin has been or
dered into solitary confinement for the remainder of
his termâ a period of thirty-six years. If his own
company is as disagreeable to himself as it has been
dangerous to his fellows, he has been sentenced to
death.
If the peace jubilee in Washington on Tuesday
were designed to exult in the peace with Spain it was
dilatory, if for peace in the Philippines it was pre
mature, but it appears to have been a good show all
the same.
As a general proposition no kind of straw repays
the work of thorough threshing, but the straw bond
business is an exception to the rule.
GEARY STREET
FRANCHISE OF
GREAT VALUE
Three Millions Will Be
Lost to the City.
PROPOSED STEAL EXPOSED
COMPETING LINE TO THE FER
RIES BLOCKED.
Under the New Charter the Geary-
Street Cars Could Be Run to
the Foot of Market
Street.
The wholes-ale steal contemplated by the
Market-street Railway Company in the
matter of franchises will no doubt secure
the indorsement of the Street Committee
of the Board of Supervisors at its meet
ing this afternoon. The members of the
committee put themselves on record at the
meeting of the board on Monday and
there is no reason to suppose that they
will change their minds, even in the face
of the storm of indignation that has been
aroused in the community since the mag
nitude of the scheme became apparent.
In an interview published in these col
umns yesterday Mayor Phelan set forth
many of the reasons why the street rail
way corporation is attempting, at this
time, to secure control of the various
franchises asked for, particularly the
franchise for the Geary-street road. In
connection with this last named line there
is still another reason why the acquisi
tion of a franchise at this time would be
of incalculable value to the Market-street
Railway Company, and a consequent loss
to the city. Under the present lawâ the
provisions of which would control the
franchise were it grantedâ the owner or
owners of one line of street railway are
permitted to run cars over the line of
railway operated by un opposition com
pany for a distance of five blocks. Under
the provisions of the new charter thi.s
privilege is extended so as to allow the
cars of one company to be run over the
line owned and operated by another com
pany for a distance of ten blocks. If the
franchise for the Geary-street road were
disposed of under the terms of the new
charter, as it should be, the person se
curing the franchise would be permitted
to run the cars of the Geary-street line
to the ferry depot over the lines of the
Market-street Railway Company on Mar
ket street. This privilege would enhance
the value of the franchise more than 50
per cent and would result in a proportion
ate benefit to the city from the increased
price that could be obtained from the
sale of the franchise as well as the re
sultant increase in the gross receipts of
the road, a percentage of which would be
paid to the city each year as provided by
law.
It is estimated that if the franchise Is
granted at this time its value will be de
creased for the above reason alone about
$1,500,000. If to this sum is added the mon- |
etary advantage that would be derived by j
the Market-street Railway Company be
cause of the conditions enumerated by !
Mayor Phelan in his interview the amount i
foots up to the stupendous sum of over !
$3,000,000. The corporation can afford to
pay well to secure such an advantage,
and the question of how much it proposes
to pay for the necessary number of votes
in the Board of Supervisors is a matter
of much speculation about the City Hall. ;
Yesterday City and County Attorney-
Lane rendered a.n opinion as to the proper
action of the Board of Supervisors in the
matter of the application of the Market
street Railway Company for permission
to use electricity as a motive power on
the Post-street road and on the proposed
so-called corkscrew road. He finds that ,
the company's franc. Ise for the Post- |
street road gives it the privilege of using
electricity as a motive power. He also
holds that the corporation has the right j
to use electricity on the proposed cross
town line. Permission to use electricity
must, however, be lirst granted by the
Board of Supervisors. As to the matter
of granting this permission the opinion
Is indefinite. Mr. Lane holds that if the
erection cf poles and the stringing of
wires is held by the board to be a privi- â 
lege, then the " right to erect poles and >
string wires must bo hold open for com
petitive bids, as provided by law. If the
board holds that the right is not a privi
lege, then the Market-street Railway
Company may be allowed to go ahead
with the work of erecting poles and
stringing wires as soon as permission so
to do is granted by the board.

STAMPS FOR FIVE DOLLARSâ
Stamp Collector. The Dotted States Gov
ernment is offering >ets of twelve unused
newspaper and periodical stamps to col
lectors. Such stamps, however, cannot be
used in the payment of postage. The col
lection is sold only in sets for $5 and is
made up of one stamp of each of the fol
lowing denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25 and 50
cents and 2, 5, 10, 20, 60 and 100 dollars.
RAILWAY MAIL CLERKSâSubscri
ber, Cal. The next examination for posi
tions in the railway mail service will be
held In San Francesco October 6. Appli
cation blanks ctfn be obtained by writing
to the Civil Service Commission, Wash
ington. D. C. You may find consolation
in the fact that in IS% there were in that
branch 5013 who underwent examination,
3048 passed and Gl3 were appointed. The
figures in lSf>7 were 6431, 47U>. 218; in 1898,
4799. 3828, 698. If you should take the ex
amination and should pass you can judge
from these figures what the chances of
appointment are.
A POSTAL, ORDERâ G. A. F., Eureka.
Cal. If a postal money order was sent to
a mmor and that minor, not being able to
write, was accompanied by his lawfully
appointed guardian, that guardian on pro
ducing letters of guardianship to the Post
master would be authorized to sign for his
ward. The Postmaster, who stated that
"By strict process of law I cannot pay
the money because the papers must be
signed by the person to whom the order
is addressed," evidently does not know as
much as he ought to.
THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDSâ W. C.
M., Sonora. Cal. The language generally
spoken at Manila is the Spanish; on tne
Philippines the language is that of the
Malays. There are as many dialects of
that language as there are tribes of peo
ple. There are many of the neighboring
tribes that are unable to converse with
each other by reason of the variation of
dialect.
The fare from San Francisco to Manila
is first-class. $220. Every steamer that
leaves San Francisco for Hongkong will
carry passengers to that point and from
there they have to go on another line to
the capital of the Philippines.
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING-Sub
scriber, Llvermore, Cal. There is not a
separate "department" of electrical engi
neering at the University of California
but there is a course of Instruction in elec
trical engineering, this course being a
part of the curriculum of the college of
mechanics. The requirements for admis
sion to the college of mechanics are Eng

who wish to take the course of electrical
engineering must have the requirements
enumerated. On application. James Sut

HE SAVED HER
WATER FRONT TO
SAN FRANCISCO
Passing of Ex-State
Senator Gardner.
A PIONEER AND POLITICIAN
HE DEFEATED A SENATE BILL
TO ROB THE STATE.
When It Came to the Final Test the
Ring Offered Him $40,000
for His Vote and He
Refused.
Tha funeral of Hon. James H. Gardner,
ex-State Senator, '49er and the olde3t
Custom-house broker in California, took
place at San Rafael ye&terday. Mr. Gard
ner died of old age at Sausalito last Sun
day night and a host of his city friends
went over to the funeral yesterday. The
remains were placed in a vault at San
Rafael temporarily and later will be sent
to his old home in South Carolina.
The pall-bearers were: F. A. Berlin, C.
N. Stoutenborough, Colonel Thomas H.
Craig, M. R. Dundas, William H. Thorn
ley, L. M. Kellogg, Captain J. Mclntyre
and T. W. Jackson.
James H. Gardner was born in South
Carolina in 1810 and came to California
early in 1549. He went to the mines, where
he made more friends than money. He
was elected a number of times to the
State Senate later on and was one of the
bitterest opponents of the bill introduced
to sell San Francisco's water front. In
fact, had it not been for the stand taken
by Mr. Gardner all the wharves from
Meiggs wharf to the Mail dock would now
be private property.
Toward the end of the fight, when pri
vate individuals were pulling every string
to gain their end, Senator Gardner was
taken into a private room at Sacramento
and a certified check for $40,000 offered
him for his vote. The bribe was refused
and the fight went on with the result that
the State still owns the water front.
After he got tired of mining and poli
tics Mr. Gardner held a number of im
portant positions in the Custom-house and
only retired from Uncle Sam's service to
go into business for himself. He estab
lished what is now the house of Gardner
& Thornley, the first to do a purely Cus
tom-house brokerage business on the Pa
cific Coast. About ten years ago Mr.
Gardner retired from active business, but
up to a few years ago used to make daily
visits to his office. Then his age began to
tell on him and he was rarely seen out
side his home at Sausalito. Toward the
end he suffered considerably, but at the
last he was free from pain and passed
away without a struggle.
TOOK "ROUGH ON RATS."
Thomas K:\iie Had Been Drinking
He wily and Became Desponded
to the Point of Suicide.
Thomas Kane, a laboring man, 52 years
old, committed suicide yesterday morning
by taking "Rough on Rats" at his resi
dence, corner of Twenty-first avenue and
X street. He had been out of employ
ment and drinking foiisome time. Lately
he had become very despondent, and it is
believed that he was insane at the time
he took the poison.
The deceased left a widow and three
children in poor circumstances. An in
quest will be held this afternoon at 1
o'clock.

i ::'' Office and Yardsâ 4so Mala StreÂ«U-BIG CHECKS PROMISED
FOR THE DEWEY STATUE
TK committee having in charge the Dewey statue promises to have
some important and gratifying announcements to make to-day. Yester
day the members were actively at work, and several surprisingly large
subscription* were promised. Checks for the amounts are expected to
flay, and then the names of the subscribers and the amounts will be
made public.
H&yor Phelan personally saw several pentlemen during the day. and late
in trie afternoon expressed himself as highly pleased with the result of his
conferences. Other members of the committee informed the Mayor that they
lad met With equal encouragement. The address to the public will not be
ps-ued until to-day, as the sub-committee having charge of its preparation
n not completed the draft of it yesterday. The address appeals to the
patriotism of every man, woman and child in the State. All the local news
papers have been visited and have consented to receive subscriptions to. the
fund as soon :is the committee announ<vÂ« that it Is ready to receive general
contributions.
The sub-committee on design has already begun work. The members are
all gentlemen of tine artistic tastes, and knowing in advance just how much
will have to spend for the monument they are prepared to proceed with
thÂ« work wit bout delay. The Lick statuary In front Of the City Hall cost
100.000, the limit tixed for the Dewey monument, while the monument to
tt Key in Golden Gate Park cost $60,000. The committee is satts
â d that it can erect a monument to Admiral Dewey vastly more beautiful
and Imposing than the Lick statuary.
The Question of location promises to be the great bone of contention.
Communications are pouring in upon the committee offering suggestions on
that point, and even the members themselves are divided In opinion as to the
most avaih, i.l. site. Fortunately, this Is one of the last matters to be de
cided, bo the committee will have ample time to carefully consider the
merits of all the proposed sites before making its selection.
To-morrow the general committee will hold another meeting at Mayor
Phelan's private office, and the members expect to be able to make some
flattering reports.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, MAY 25, 1899.
SPAULDING'S SHORTAGE
IS RATED AT $7500
The Fireman's Fund Cashier Was Considered
Exemplary, and His Defalcation Remains a
Mysteryâ Has He Committed Suicide ?
A Curiosity of Human Nature.
Detectives Employed.
THE amount of money stolen by
E. W. Spaulding, the abscond
ing assistant cashier of the Fire
man's Fund Insurance Company,
is reported by the finance com
mittee to be $7500. The story of the
embezzlement and flight published ex
clusively in The Call yesterday caused
commotion among bankers and insur
ance agents. Men who knew Spauld
ing and were familiar with his habits
of daily life expressed the greatest
surprise over the story of his crooked
ness. He was regarded as an exemp
lary young man who never went to
the races or sought the companionship
of the gay and dissolute. He seemed
devotedly attached to his family, and
when his daily work in the office was
finished went directly to his home in
Oakland.
One of the leading officers of the com
pany made this remark yesterday:
"I was astonished when I read in The
Call to-day that Ed Spaulding had
gone wrong. If I had been called upon
to select from the fifty or sixty young
men in the office the one least likely
to go wrong, I believe I would have se
lected Spaulding."
There was a meeting of .the directors
of the Fireman's Fund yesteiday after
noon in the oliice of L>. J. ritapiea,
picMUtiu of the institution. Figures
of ihe expert accountants were re
viewed, i. he fact was disclosed that
Bpauiding'B career of crookedness be
gan about one year ago. After the di
lectoih' meeting dissolved, .^resident

L.ougee, treasurer of the institution,
was confident that the amount sioien
by the absconding assistant cashier
was not in excess of $7500.- He said
that ail the transactions had been care
tuiiy checked and that. the sum named
was the exact figure of the embezzle
ment. .; .iVw!;-::-/:,'--*^^.'-- L"&. <',*"-. :
In speaking of the affair yesterday,
the onicers or the institution spuivc vi
the money loss as trivial in comparison
with the legitimate losses which the
company sustained In its vast opera
tions of insurance. While President
biaples and his associates deemed the ',
loss small, yet they resolved in the m-
I teiesi of public Justice, 10 take prompt
] measures to ascertain the whereabouts
of the defaulter, and bring him to an
accounting for his wrong-doing. De
-1 tectives have, therefore, been en
; gaged to trace Spauldlng's movements
11. m the time he left the office for his
vacation. Much sympathy was ex
; pleased for the parents and wife or the
i fugitive.
It transpires that Assistant Cashier
i Spaulding told his wife and his father
I on the eve of his vacation that he was
i going on the road for the Fireman's
! Fund and intended to visit Portland.
{ The first incident to arouse suspicion
lof crookedness was a message from
| young Snaulding's wife to Vice Presi
j dent Faymonville asking when her
! husband would return. The fact was
i then, or subsequently, disclosed
that Spauldlng had told his wife that
he was going to Portland In the inter
est of the company.
The real cashier of the Fireman's
Fund is Thomas M. Gardiner. Insur
' a nee men were dazed when they heard
j that ihere had been an embezzlement
â¢ of $7500 in a department under the su
pervision of Mr. Gardiner. The fact
was taken into account that Spaulding
j had handled the funds under Charles
jS. Woods, the old-time cashier, and
was familiar with the business of the
j department. Still it could not be un
| derstood how he managed to deceive
i the accomplished accountant, Tom Gar
, diner.
! Insurance men were also surprised
I to learn that the experts in the office
of the Fireman's Fund had checked
up all the agency accounts since the
defalcation was discovered, and were
able to show (hat only $7500 had been
stolen by Spaulding.
One insurance man remarked:
"The Fireman's Fund is represented
in the United States by nearly two
thousand agencies. The company trans
acts a business of two million dollars
annually. I cannot understand how ail
these agency accounts have been
checked up since last Monday."
There ar^ various conjectures re
garding the whereabouts of the an-
Bcondlng Spaulding. He left his watcli
and jewelry at horn**: when' he went
away, but it is surmised that he lert
these valuable articles to create the
suspicion that he intended to commit
suicide.
Some of thr; officers of the company
fancy that he got aboard one of tiie
transports" and sailed for Manila. Oth
ers 'ieve that he went to .South
America. The notion that he enlisted,
in the army <inder an assumed name
flr<is some adherents.
The op l - 1 '- Is almost universal
that Spa nlding did not spend his money
in gambling, drinking or at the race
course or in the company of dissolute
people, hence there is an impression
that he must have plunged a little In
stock speculations. .
DID HE BUY A GOLD BRICK?
I Theory Thet Spaulding Was
E : unk.oed in a Fraudulent
Speculation.
OAKLAND. May 24. â Was Cashier
â  SpauMinp betrayed into buying a gold
â¢ brick? This thoory has been advanced by
' some of the young man's friends and
there is good foundation for their belief.
Tin- story of the defalcation and ab
] sconding of Edward F. Spaulding, pub
lished exclusively in 10-day's Call, fell as
a thunderclap in this city, where the
' Spauldlng family has bÂ«?en known and
j honored for a generation. The default
ers father was Mayor of Oakland many
years ago and his brother was secretary
of the Board of Public Works.
1 Even in spite of President Staples' ac-
I knowledgment of the shortage there are :
| many who refuse to believe that young j
| Spaulding has done anything wrong, j
] Everybody has a good word for him and
bstl loss to account for any cause that
could have induced him to misappropriate
the money of the Fireman's Fund Com
pany.
If Cashier Spaulding spent the money
he is alleged to havt stolen before he j
took his flight he nab squandered It in i
San Francisco, for there is not the least '
indication that he was spending more j
than his income in this city. Neither
was he absent from his home for any
periods that might cause suspicion. His
wife declares her entire Ignorance of any-
I thing connected with her husband's
I wrong-doing and no one doubts her story.
1 In Spaulding's preparation for flight he
j did not take his wlio or his father into j
: his confidence and both are equally at a J
loss to account for his disappearance.
There is a general belief that Spaulding
; whs induced to speculate In a gold brick
; and that he may have taken the money
I expecting to double it and replace it in
> the company's treasury. In no other man-
I ncr can the money be accounted for.
bpauiding was never seen at the race
track and was never known to wager a
dollar.
Last January Dr. George C. Pardee, in
! conversation with a Call reporter, said
he had heard It whispered several times
i that a well-known man had been a victim
, of the gold brick fraud to the extent of
! $6000. The doctor had not learned any of j
| the details, but said the story seemed to
I be accepted as a fact. To-night Dr. Par
{ dee wns asked If he had heard any more
i of the incident, and he said that he had
j heard it mentioned since, but only in
! directly. The story was common talk
j among the commuters on the ferry-boats
: that it was one of their number, and j
i Spaulding was a commuter at that time,
returning from the insurance office every
evening to his home on Webster street.
Spaulding was a young man of unusual 1
! talent and progressive methods. He en- |
tired the office of the Fireman's Fund !
( many years aÂ«n, and was advanced over I
â  the heads of many other clerks because j
!of his efficiency. He has never given any !
i one cause to suspect that he was leading
i the life which he must have been doing
! to squander the money that is reported as
1 missing.
Mrs. K. F. Spaulding is with her slster
j in-law. Mrs. X. W. Spaulding, at the
i latter's homo on Eighteenth street. For;
over a week she has been expecting the i
return of lier husband, but has heard j
! nothing of him since he left Oakland on
May 6.
â '1 am quite at a loss to account for Mr. j
i Spauiding's absence," said the cashier's i
wife tp-day. "He loft home two weeks j
ago last Saturday, and ' told me that he:
was going to Portland on business for the i
company. He was to have returned in a I
few days, and then we were both to have i
â  gone off on " vacation, lit- did not re- j
: turn and I have heard nothing of him
since. I will never believe he is guilty of !
'. any wrongdoing. There must be some
: great mistake somewhere. Some accident !
must have happened, or he would have !
rt-turned over a week ago. I do not know
where he is. but I feel sure that every
thing will soon be cleared up."
Mrs. Spaulding is quite sick, and her
: two little children are also ailing and
! constantly calling for papa.
The aged parents of the missing cashier
are heartbroken over their son's down
j fall. They will not be consoled by friends, ,
i who have extended sympathy and hopes,
. and they fear for the worst. The father, j
| N. \V. Spaulding, fears that his son has
: committed suicide.
"Two weeks ago last Saturday my son
: made an engagement with me by tele
: phone for luncheon in San Francisco."
I said Mr. Spaulding. ''When I called at
the office hÂ»- had changed his mind. He
told me that it was Impossible for him |
to Â£Â«M away for lunch just then, because I
\ he was working on his books at the time, j
] and Inasmuch as ho was going on his |
: vacation in a few days ho wished to have
; his books in such shape mat it would be
easier for Mr. Gardner to take up the
â  work where he left off.
"On this occasion Ed betrayed no rest
lessness and seemed perfectly composed.
I excused him and I thought no more
about it. An hour later he left the of
ficp and he has not been seen since.
"On the following Wednesday my
daughter-in-law called on me very much
alarmed and Informed me that her hus
' band had gone to Portland, Or., on the
previous Saturday, but had not written
since his departure. She was in great

distress, for when Ed left his home he
had told her that he had to go to Port
land and would return by Wednesday
morning, and for her to have the things
all packed and ready, so the fai.illy could
leave on the same day for Madrone
Springs for the usual summer outing. Be
fore Ed left she had packed his small va
lise with such underwear and articles as
he might need on his trip north, but he
had removed the articles, taking only the
valise with him. Moreover he had
stripped himself of all jewelry. His gold
waten and even his scarf pin are now
lying in the bureau drawer at his home.
"This whole matter weighs very heav
ily upon me and his mother, for we
haven't an inkling as to his whereabouts.
As a son Ed was always very correct.
When 1 gave him a $fj piece it always
went further than it would with the
others. He never gambled; never at
tended a horse race that I know of. and
if he had speculated I should have heard
of it. As a husband and father he has
always been kind and faithful. From his
office he usually would come directly to
his home, and if he went out evenings
his wife was with him.
"What he could have done with the
money charged to his shortage Is a mys
tery to me, and I cannot understand how
any such shortage could occur anyway,
since he always settled up his accounts
with the cashier each evening. If he had
been withholding anything it certainly
would have been detected sooner.
"Being his father, I naturally doubt it
all. but of course where there is such a
clew as they claim, there must be some
thing in it; but if he did it. then what
on earth could he have done with all this
money?
"A gold brick? Why. no. Ed could not
have been imposed upon that way. He
was too clever a young .man to have been
led to part with money on such a propo
sition. Yet. where did the money go?
"I have feared that perhaps Ed, real
izing his shortage, has committed sui
cide. Yes, that may be the solution of
his absence, and yet it would not be his
nature. Well, I do not know what to
think."

OUR EXPORTS AND IMPORTS.
The New York circular of Henry ''lows says:

many months past It was not to be ex-

temporary conditions, both domestic and f'.r

demand for both domestic and Imported prod
ucts; we therefore find the April returns 'f

THE MAGNATES OF WALL STREET.
11. nry Clews, the New York banker, thus
sea :
"Mr. Flower's sudden death simply made
a bargain-counter for the thousands of mil
lionaires and the hundreds of multi-million
aires to pick up securities cheap, and they
were quick and ready to take tin everything
In the way of good properties offered at the |
concessions which were made. Mr. Flower's
death removes a man from active lite who
was a factor in the development of this coun
try's resources and one whom all will miss;
but Wall street will Boon forget the shock and
the worst of it may certainly he considered
as over.
ThÂ» Wall street market cannot, be meas
ured by any single man coming into exist
ence or going out of it. Mr. Flower was prob
ably worth " ll "." 1 "'. Think for a moment
of the vast money power which backs Wall
street and the business Interests of this coun
try which he leaves behind: John D. Rocke
feller, worth 000,000 : William, his broth
er. 1150.000,000; the Astors. $250,000,000; the
Vandorbilts, $400,000,000; Carnegie, $150,000,000;
the Coulds. $100,000,000; D. O. Mills, $40,000,000;
C V Huntlngton, $40,000,000, and a great
many others worth twice as much as what
Governor Flower possessed. I i?ive this array
of figures Of individual wealth to show how
insignificant the power of any one man Is as
compared with a combination of others. This
is an ate of combination, and Wall street is
now the market of the world for speculative
dealings and Investment transactions. The
Kreat wealth of Europe is more or less in and
out of this market in both classes of opera
tions. It was thought when A. T. Stewart
died there would he no one to take his place,
and behold the chance! If he should come
back now, there would be no place for him.
nor could he create one. When Commodore
Yanderrilt died the feeling was the same. So
it was when William H. Vanderbilt departed,
also Jay Gould and a host of others. None
of these are missed now in business affairs;
to the world Â£â¢ ea on and will to the end."

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, May 24.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
Business was slack in the markets here to
day on the approaching settlement. The tone
was depressed. The feature was the slump of
Spanish fours to Gl l^ for the reasons men
tioned yesterday. Other foreign stocks were
sympathetically affected. Tintos were 4s'j 6 ;
Anacondas, 12: Utahs, B*4; Bostons, 2 7-16.
Americans opened flat and remained steady,
i later hardening slightly, but they were very
I idle. New York began firm, but in the street
was stagnant, and the closing was heavy. Ca
nadian Pacific weakened to upder par, but
Berlin and Amsterdam bought freely to 101%.
There Is some Continental demand for gold that
prevents arrivals from reaching the bank. The
day's session of the Exchange was preceded by
hearty singing of the national anthem, ac
companied by two cornets, one played by a
veteran member. The demonstration was in
honor of the Queen's birthday.

BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON. May 24.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow of the
wool trade:
The strength and activity previously â  noted
in the wool market has been well sustained
during the week, under review, and in some,
respects the movement partakes of the char
acteristics of a veritable boom. It is not as
yet, however, a manufacturers' market, al
though consumers have been a little more in
evidence than previously. The greater portion
of the business done consists of. purchases by
dealers themselves, although aw a rule where
manufacturers have bought they have been
obliged to pay higher prices or they have not
succeeded In getting the wool. a number of
dealers are not offering their wool at all and
are practically out of the market. The ad
vance in the price of territory wool in this
market ha* resulted In checklnc the â¢ export
movement, and the lew remaining lots of Aus
tralian wool in bond owned by dealers are' held
at higher figures than foreign buyers will pay.
The sales of the week at Boston amount to
6,031,000 pounds domestic and 667,000 pounds
foreign, making a total of 6,688,000, against a [
total of 8.315,500 for the previous week, and a ;
total of 2,340,000 for the corresponding week last I
year. Sales since January 1, 1599, amounted to ]
96,291,800 rounds, against 45,345,310 pounds last
year at this time. I

A MAN SAID.
"I don't believe you can arrange food
so that it will go to rebuild and nour-
ish the brain. Grape-Nuts is a most
delightful tasting food, but I can't un-
derstand how you expect any certain
food to be appropriated by any certain
part of the body."
A good honest skeptic and well worth
attention.
Actual results are better than any
theory pro or con. Grape-Nuts are be-
ing eaten by millions of Americans
and any interested person In any city
of America can satisfy himself by ques-
tioning his neighbor as to the result of
the use of Grape-Nuts.
. . The testimony is given over and
over that after 10 days' use there comes
a feeling of strength, sturdiness, clear-
ness of intellect and power of the mind
that is unmistakable.
There is a reason.
Thinking uses up each day parts of
the filling of the cells in brain and Na-
ture demands albumen and natural
phosphate of potash (not from the drug
store) to make new the soft Jelly-like
substance which is used as the filling
of these brain cells.
Grape-Nuts contain these elements
direct from Mother Nature and pre-
pared in the form of a most delicious
and dainty food, practically pre-di-
gested and quickly absorbed into the
system. . x :;.;
The hard stubborn facts are that
Grape-Nuts do build brains.

ONE STATE OFFICE
NO LONGER EXISTS
PUBr.fC WORKS COMMISSIONEK
A JOB OF THE PAST.
According: to an opinion rendered yes
terday by Attorney General Tiny [Â
Ford, the office of Commissioner of rr.Mic
\V.>rks no longer exists nor has it since
March 1 of this year. Inquiry was made
upon this subject by State Controller E.
P. Colgan, who was desirous of knowing
if he would be justified in authorizing the
payment of the salary of the officer in
question.
Mr. Ford's reply is of considerable length,
as he care-fully r.vi.ws all of the legisla
tive acts bearing upon the office, which
was originally created in March, IXO3. "for
a period of four years only." It. however,
provided that the first person appointed
thereunder should bold tor two years
from March 1, 1893, ami all subsequent
appointments Bhould b.- for four
in 1807 the act of ik>', was amended, elim
inating the limitation. This act also pro
that the oflice should terminate on
March 1, 182*9. and that no money should
be provided for carrying on the work of
the Commissioner thereafter, and Mr.
Ford states:
On March 22, IS9O, Senate bill No. ?,2Â« was
signed by the Governor. This ait, creating
- :i< t- of ('..nimisMoner of Public Works,
;.-s that the term of office shall be four i
years, and section â¢'! thereof repeals the act â 
il and 18H7 and all acts In conflict there- '
with, and provides, further, that this act hh.ill
be a continuation and renewal of the office
of Commissioner of Public Works. The nub- j
ject matter of section 3 of the act of IS9!< is :
â  "clflcally mentioned In the title. The :
enrolled bill of UN, as signed by the Gov
ernor, fixes the salary of the Commissioner of
Public Works at t'-'DW per annum and adds to
â i 3 thereof the following clause: "This
act shall be construed as a renewal and con- |
tlnuation of the office of Commissioner of
Public Works." The bill as passed by the
Legislature provided for a salary of }180Q per ]
annum to the Commissioner and the above j
clause in re-continuation of the office, etc., '
wan not 'â 'â¢ntnined therein.
Mr. Ford continues: "I am of the opln- j
ion that by the terms of the act of Feb
ruary 25, isS", the office of the Commis-
Bioner of Public Works terminated on the
Ist day of March. 1899, and thereafter
ceased to exist." And further: "That the ;
I March 21, IBM, as signed by the i
Governor is not the act as passed by the
Legislature, as appears upon the face of
the journals of both houses of the Legis
lature, and that the same is therefore
null and void."
He Â«ays in conclusion:
The bill as signed by the Governor had
Incorporated in its provisions the portions ;
which the Assembly had sought to add to thÂ»
bill, namely, the raising of the salary of the !
Â«'. .mmif sinner from $I<<d<) to }2. r ,OO per annum!
rind the addition of the continuation clause,
but from which amendments It had receded. |
: In other words, the bill a? slpned by the Gov
ernor is not the bill as passed by the Legis- i
lature as shown by the Journals of both the j
Senate and Assembly. â¢ â¢ â¢ It appears, I
therefore, that there is now no office of Com- j
rnis'slc.n^r of PuMlc Works, and. therefore, no i
officer holding the Fame, and that you would
not be authorized In the payment of any fur
ther salary with respect thereto.

versy This Week.
HITTING THE MAIN FEATURE
DR. McGRAW TAKES HOLD OF
THE SAN JOSE TEAM.
New Players Signed and a General
Bracing-Up Is Going On â Sacra
mento Strikes a Winning
Streak.
San Francisco still holds the lead in the
championship struggle, though by a nar
row margin. Santa Cruz, by winning
three games during the week, passed
Oakland and is now close to the leader.
with the team from across the bay a good
third, the lops of two of the three games
with the locals having cut down its per
centage somewhat. Watsonville retains
fourth position, but its position with ref-
First Baseman Sullivan of
the San Francisco Team.
erence to the leaders is hardly as pood as
it was a week ago. San Jose and Sacra
mento are tied fur fifth place, with a like
number nf pames won and l<">st. B^low is
given th>- standing of the teams in de
tail:
Manager Ewing failed to make good his
premise to land in lirst place with the
close of last week's series, and the San
Franciscos will light It out this week
with the aggregation from the seashore.
The lobsters have been coming with a
rush of late by putting up the very best
quality of ball, and tin- games at Recrea
tion Park next Saturday and Sunday and
at Golden Gate Sunday morning promise
to be the most hotly contested that have
yet been played. Last week's games dem
onstrated the old theory that slugging
wins against faultless fielding, and thia
week the two heaviest hitting teams in
the league are pitted against each other.
They are evenly matched now in this re
spect, as well as in fielding, and while the
cranks may not witness as scientific base
ball as the game of last Sunday they will
see what pleases them vastly moreâter
rific smashes and plenty of sprinting, for
the ball will be kept sailing most of the
time when San Francisco and Santa Cruz
get to shooting at it alternately. The large
audiences of last week will be doubled
during this series both here and in Oak
land, for the fanatics are rapidly thawing
out under the influence of the almost per
fect ball the league is now serving up.
The Interior games this week will be
Oakland at San Jose and Sacramento at
Watsonvllle.
The San Jose Club has a new manager
in the person of Dr. D. F. McGraw, a
prominent dentist of the Garden City, a
man of wealth and standing in the com
munity and an enthusiastic admirer of
the game. Dr. McQraw will bend every
energy to popularize the xame in that
city and to that end he hns already be-
Kun to strengthen the team, paying par
ticular attention to the batting depart
ment, in which respect the team has been
weak all the season. In furtherance of
this plan the new manager has released
Third Baseman Fessel and Right Fielder
Folev, having signed Leake and Profes
sor Graham of Santa Clara College. Both

of the new men are heavy stickers as
well as exceptionally fast fielders. Leake
will fill the infield position while Graham
will go into the garden. It looks as
though San Jose now has as Btronjr a
fielding team as Oakland, and Chief Bor
chera says it can bat with San Francisco
and Santa Cruz. The reconstructed prune
pickers are certain to find favor with the
home patrons of the game and are apt to
jump right up among the leaders without
delay.
Ewing has the hardest luck of any man
ager in the league in the matter of acci
dents to his men. The injury to Hammond
last Sunday may keep him out of the
games this week, in which case Dun
leavy will have to don the mask and air
package again. Dunleavy is a good man
behind the bat and a strong thrower to
bases, but Hammond's absence weakens
Oakland's batting powers materially.
It is nip and tuck between Fireman Fitz
and Iberg. Frisco's two twlrlers. Fitz
has the better of it up to date, but Iberg
has been handicapped by the injury to
his eye received a few days before the
opening of the season while practicing.
The Injured optic is still bloodshot and
gives him some trouble, but is steadily
growing better.
On Sunday morning Moskiman was
batted out of the box by the Frisco slug
gers. Not daunted, he went against them
again in the afternoon, holding them
down to five hits and one run. There's
nerve for you.
Pace has not caught for Santa Cruz
since the series with San Francisco two
weeks ago, his hands having been badly
hurt at that time-. He will go in again
this week, however, and will add strength
to the team.
Santa Cruz fanatics have petitioned
President Moran to assign "Whltewings"
Cahill for duty here this week, and their
request will probably be granted. The
Santa Cruzans imagine Patsy is the only
umpire in the league.
Sacramento appears to have struck the
up grade again. With the team material
ly strengthened the men have steadied
down and are again playing winning ball,
to the intense joy of the Sacramento
cranks, who Include about every resident
of the capital. Outside of San Francisco
Sacramento is the best ball team on the
Pacific Coast.
Mertes r.as succeeded in breaking into
the game at Chicago, having replaced
Green in right field, the latter having
weakened in his batting. The Chicago
public is delighted with the Callfornian's
work.
Oakland is becoming a hot ball town
again, and the Dudes are receiving loyal
support.
Watsonville nnd Santa Cruz are clamor
ing for country umpires. Tiny pay that
all thr^o are from the city and that the
country should be given at least one
>â â¢ ;'â¢ ree.
Swindells is more than holding his own
among the backstops, and Manager Har
ris is delighted with his work.
Pvnf began the season by batting like
,i National Leaguer, but has fallen down
in his stick work most woefully of late.
"Josh" Riley did not recover from the
rffects of the pitched ball he stopped with
his head last Saturday all that day. For
the remainder of the game his legs were
wobbly, while his head buzzed like a tele
phone bell. ___________
Hujfe Machinery Moved.
An unusual display of heavy transpor
tation was witnessed early this morninp
In the moving of the old Market Street
Railway's turntable from the foot of
Market street to Twenty-fourth and
Nebraska streets. This huge Iron frame
weighing many tons has been sub
stituted by one of more modern con
struction and has bern consigned, like
rood old locomotives, to the scrap pile-.
ii was placed on trucks with a capacity
of thousands of pounds and wheels re
sembling a section of a redwood giant,
and when traffic abated <>n Market street
this morning was hauled up the principal
avenue of the city to Its destination.
The motive power consisted of two score
of animals, and the Immense circular
frame nearly occupied the width of the
street In transit.

MIDWEEK NOTES OF
DRAMA AND MUSIC
LONDON, May 25.â Last evening the
Covent Garden Opera Company sang
three acts of "Lohegrin" at Windsor
Castle before the Queen and the royal
family and household by special com
mand of her Majesty. Previous to the
performance Maurice Grau had the honor
of being includfd in the Queen's dinner
party. Alter tho performance the arusts
Were presented to her Majesty by Karl
de Gray, and the Queen thanked them
for the performance.
Evidently Clyde Fitch's play, "Tho
Moth and tho Flame," is up for a big
engagement at the Columbia. The man
agement announce that an extra matinee
will be given on Tuesday. These extra
matinees are always interestingâ not only
on account of the show, but on account
of the audience, which is largely made
up of actor folk.
The Alcazar is doing prosperously with
the revival of ''In Mizzoura." one of the
best plays ever written in America. Mr.
Hastings is notably good in the part of
the Sheriff. The Lewis Morrison season
commences Monday with "Hamlet."
The Tivoli's enterprise has been turned
to good account in the production of "The
Mandarin," a new, attractive and high
priced work by De Koven and Smith.
"The Gypsy Baron" is enjoying a sump
tuous production in the Grand Opera
house at the hands of the Southwell com
pany. These singers are gaining steadily
in popularity.
Moung Toon and Moung Chet, the Rur
mose jugglers who do all sorts of incredi
ble tricks without tho aid of their hands,
are the special attraction at the Or
pheum.
The famous Kneisei string rjuartet gives
two concerts this week in the Sherman X-
Clay Hallâ to-morrow night and Satur
day afternoon at 3.
The amateur show in the theater at the
Chutes to-night will take the form of min
strels. There will be female as well as
male participants.

TATTOOED BIRDS
ON DUNPHY'S BACK
PAT'I. A. PVMPHY. well known and well liked on the Hialto, has re
turned from Manila, whore he has seen hard service with the Four
teentb [nfaatry. Dunphy received his discharge from the army from
Washington at the instance of President McKlnley. "When the war
broke out Paul enlisted alone with a number of other young men from
this city in i)w Fourth Cavalry.
During the fighting Dunphy distinguished himself on more than one oc
casion. Along with the rest of his
regiment in- Blept and fought in the I
trenches for over a month without I
On the Journey home Punphy fell a I
victim t<> a conspiracy laid by a few I
fellow returning aoldiers, and as a re- I
suit Paul is now in hot water, the I
story of the affair having been thor- I
oughly circulated along the line. At I
sakl Paul and a lr-w of the sol- I
diers went ashore to see the sights I
ntally have a "bit of a good I
time." The entire party visited sev- I
i r.,i places of amusement, and all im- I
bibed freelyâ save Dunphy. who I
chided his companions for drinking I
mo freely.
Dunphy repeatedly requested his I
mates to stop the boisterous carousal I
and return to the ship. This gave I
them an Incentive to eW even in a I
l-natuned way. One of the boys I
knew the nooks and crooks of the I
port like a book, and he guided thorn I
into a dark alley. They all filed into I
the narrow street one after another. I
Dunphy was the last man in the line. I
When ho was about to pass a hall- I
way lv- was seized from behind by I
of his companions and ehloro- I
formed.
Tln boys carried Dunphy into a re- I
sort where the natives were exception- I
allj clever artists with India ink. It I
was the work of a few moments to I
hare Paul's back, and in less time I
than it takes to tell it the artists had I
tattooed a ring of native birds around I
Dunphy's shoulders. The birds are I
of variegated shades and hues, and I
they lend a pit I effect to the I
plat i.I Pauls tr. pi. -tanned hid* 1 .
Y\~hen Dunphy came his senses he was aboard ship several miles
from Nagasaki. He instantly discovered that he had been tampered with
in a very rude manner by his shipmates, but Dunphy, who enjoys a joke
as well as anybody, met th situation philosophically.
The only request he had to make was that the boys should keep the
affair a secret, but the story leaked out nevertheless, and when Dunphy
v ' :is I yesterday about the affair he bestowed a knowing smile
.â â  reporter and said: "Well, the boys did job me, 1 then It cost
them something and I guess they haven't got none the best of me. It was
a joke, and aside from the fact that I'm decorated ~ith birds of all sizes
and colors, I rather enjoyed it myself. I had a pleasant trip, and though
we went through a rough campaign, the boys were Tetty well satisfied
with the conditions down there. Of course they all want to come back,
and when I left there it was generally understood that the volunteers
would be. returned very shortly."
CLEAVERS WERE

Butchers Enjoy Their
Annual Outing.
IMMENSE CROWD ATTENDS
HORSE-RACING THAT PROVED
VERY EXCITING.
An Interesting Programme WTnch Is
Carried Through Without a
Hitch â Incidents of
the Day.
There were so many thousands of people
at the sixth annual celebration of the
Butchers' Board of lYade yesterday that
the turnstiles at the racetrack became
cloKged from constant turnings, and the
half-dozen ticket-takers at Shell Mound
Park became exhausted tearing off cou
pons from the cards of admission. From
early morning until late in the- afternoon
lone linÂ« -s of cars emptied th^ir human
frelpht into the two piacos. The commit
f arrangements congratulated its-lf
that not an accident marred the day's
pleasure.
Despite th<Â» thtvaronlngr woather the
crowd (-(jualed that of previous years. A
more dfliphtful day for a picnic could
hardly be chosen by the knights of the

A HOMING PIGEON'S
CLEVER PERFORMANCE
Skyrocket, a California Bird, Covered 400
Miles in 13 Hours and 2U Minutes.
THE California Pigeon and Homing Society held its long distance race last
Sunday from Roseburg, Oregon. Fourteen birds owned by halt a dozen
members were released by an official liberator at 5:45 a. m. at Roseburg,
who telegraphed the weather was fair and cool. The first bird to arrive in
Ihis city was H. G. Hemebright's Skyrocket at 7:06:30 p. m.; distance 377 miles
326 yards, air line, making an average speed of 828.25 yards . per minute. Heme
lirifrht's Little Aggie arrived one minute later. These birds "were the only ones
t" report on the same day. This is the longest distance ever flown on this coast
in a day. The winner is worthy of great credit, from the fact that he was only
trained as far .op Sisson. Cal., from which place he failed to return in time to
enter the Ashland (Or.) race, about two weeks ago. Skyrocket is just one year
old.
Everything seems to go Hemebrlghfs way, he not only winning three
straight races In the northern series, but also In the race from Ashland, Or.,
his birds broke all Pacific Coast records for speed. In the race from Rose
burg, Or., his birds made the longest one day fly on record. He also won a first
prize diploma for best average speed in the series, as well as one for each race.
I horses and riders as they swept by the
Judge's stand. The lust event was a free
for all trotting race. The first heat and
1 first money was taken by S. Hammond's I
Guy Yernon. Time, 2:24. The second heat
resulted in G. Porrell's Orllla J winning
over her field, with M. Hart's Herald sec
ond. The most exciting race of the day '
was the steer event. M. Shweitzer's Cor- I
sine defeated I. Poly's Champion Billy :
by a short margin. The horned rivals I
went the fifth of a mile in less than a
minute, fast traveling for bovinea. The i
last race of the day was not witnessed by
many, as the mounts were too skittish
and could not be started in a bunch. The
delay was principally caused by one of
the entries Hying around the track twice
the jockey being unable to stop his flight. '
In Shell Mound Park the crowd was not
nearly as great, but sufficient to till every
corner of the large grounds. The pavilion
was thronged with dancers throughout
the day. At times it was bartjy possible
for a couple to pick their way through
< the crowd when tripping a measure. :
Bennett's band furnished excellent music. '
A cake walk by ten ladies and gentle
men of color was a feature of the day.
The performance was given on a long
platform in the racetrack. After a most
interesting exhibition of fancy turns, con- ;
tortions and graceful steps, the Judges
decided in favor of Jack and Martha
, Stewart. The efforts of little Tudie Tay
lor nd Harry Mangles, 4-year-old per
formers, pleased the spectators.
A riot was nearly caused by a candy
distribution. The committee attempted
to pass the boxes around to the ladies,
; but a score of boys whose mouths watered
for the sweets gathered around the mem- !
bers and fought for possession of the
I boxes. The result was that the com
mittee was dispossessed of the packages
and retired in a rumpied condition.

"PETE" McGLADE
CANNOT BE FOUND
The Detectives Anxiously Seek
His Present Address*
Learning That Additional Indictments Hap
Been Returned Against Him He
Goes Into Hiding.
A NUMBER of detectives were
scouring the city last night for
â¢ Pete" McGlade, who is under in
dictment for several charges of
forgery while acting a.-^ bookkeeper
in the Superintendent of Streets office.
McGlade was tried a short time ago
on a Grand Jury indictment f<ir for
gery. 1il!t waa acquitted. Evidently
ng that he would escape on the
other charges of forgery which were
ling against hhn. the authori
ties took the matter before the Graud
Jury. After a short investigation, that
returned three additional Indict
ments against him. The indictments
were placed in the hands of Detective
Tom Gibson, with instructions to ar
rest him at all hazard*. While Gibson
was searching for him, McGlade was
parking his grip preparatory to leav
ing the city. Word reached police
headquarters that the disgraced book
keeper was about to seek a more con
genial clime, evidently in the hope of
escaping 'he consequences of the al
leged crimes. As the members of the
Grand Jury were becoming anxious
about McGlade, they sent word to Cap-
PETER McGLADE.
t^in of Detectives Bohen to spare no
effort in apprehending the indicted offi
cial. Bohen, evidently concluding that
McGlade had either left the city or
was in hiding, at once detailed several
of his best men to find him. Knowing
that ))â¢â¢ was in the habit of visiting a
woman on Stockton street, Detective
Gibson was sent t" watch ht-r home,
as it was thought at th>- time that he
might leave the city with her. After
waiting for several hours and not get
ting a clew to the whereabouts of .\.r
<;iailÂ«-. the detective entered the house
and asked for the woman. He was
told that she was out, but, convinced
that the woman was .still in the house,
lv- proceeded to make a search for her.
Unable t<> find her, he inspected her
private apartments, and was surprised
to find thai most of her wearing ap
parel was missing. Qibson lust no time
in notifying Captain Bohen, and de
termined search was then instituted
for McGlade. Despite the efforts of
the detectives, his whereabouts are
still shrouded in mystery. They are
Batisfled that he has either left the city
or is in hiding.
About a w.-Vk ago a secrei indictment
was returned against McGlade. The
Grand Jury had heard the rumor that
he intended to skip in the hope .if es
caping: further prosecution, and at the
request of the foreman the indictment
van secretly Bled. Tn some, manner the
matter became public and the friends
of the disgraced bookkeeper lost go
time in informing him of the action of
the Grand Jury. The Indictment was
turned over to Chief Lees, with in
structions to do all in his power to find
and arrest McGlade.
Immediately after learning that the
Indictment had been found against him
McOlade, evidently fearing another
trial and possible conviction, made ;i .r
rangements to leave the city. The de
tectives, hearing of his intended flight,
redoubled their efforts, but without
finding a trace of him. McGlade en-
Joys his release from prison on 55000
bonds. It is eald that his bondsmen will
rot lose anything in case he has flown,
as they are personal friends of his, and
rather than "throw them down," as
McGlade remarked to a friend, he had
made arrangements that "if the bond is
forfeited they will be Indemnified
against any loss."
Captain Kohen does not believe that
McGlade has left the city, but thinks
he has gone into hiding.
"If he is in the city I think
â¢we -will get him," remarked
the veteran detective last night.
"McGlade is too well known to
hope that he can evade us. It is true
that the police have been anxiously
seeking him, but without success."
Evidently satisfied that he has left
the city, it is known that Captain Bo

hen has sent a description of Mr-
Glade to the various Sheriffs through
out the country asking them to be on
the lookout for him.
McGlade's arrest when his pecula
tions were first discovered, it was
learned last night, was brought about
by the woman who is supposed to have
gone with him.
Knowing that she was on intimate
terms with him, <>ne of Chief Lees' men
visiit'c] her house for the purpose of
finding out what had become of Mc-
Glade. The women in the bouse em
phatically declared that she was not in
the house. Suspecting that they were
telling an untruth, the detective de
clared bis intention of Bearching the
rooms. Just as he proceeded to carry
out the intention the much wanted
woman emerged from a room on the
upper floor and was promptly recog
nized by the detective. When ques
tioned she denied knowing anything
about McGlade, but finally broke down
and confessed that he was on his way
to Mexico. The detective reported the
conversation to Chief Lees, who, by
using the telegraph wires, headpd off
the absconding official. An officer was
sent for him and he was brought back.
As the woman has also disappeared, the
police are morally certain that she is
with McGlade.
To-day pictures of McOlade will bo
sent to the various officials throughout
the country, with instructions to arrest
him on sight. As he cannot very well
disguise himself, the police are hopeful
Of apprehending him.
A DANGEROUS NEWSBOY.
Harry Johnson Robbed a Companion
and Tried to Suffocate Him
With Carbon-Monoxide.
Harry Johnson, a newsboy, is on the
mail to be made a first-class criminal ac
cording to the evidence against him in
Judgi- Graham's court yesterday when h^
appeared to answer a charge of petty
i larceny.
The complaining witness was another
â  newsboy, Joseph Mooney, who testified
I that a few nights ago he took Harry to
hi* room in the Revere House, 878 Mis
sion street, to sleep with him. Next
morning, when Mooney awoke, Harry was
K'"i!>- and had taken with him 85 cents
and a black sweater belonging to Mooney.
Not only that, hut tlu- gas had been
1 turned on, and the room was full of the
deadly carbon-monoxide, Harry evidently
being intent upon suffocating Mooney
after robbing him. â  Johnson sold the
sweater to Aaron Solomons, a pawn
broker. for 20 cents.
Hurry refused to testify and declined
to give any information about himself.
The Judge s.-nt him to the Whlttier Re

FECKER WANTS
DAMAGES FROM
W, J, SUTHERLAND
Another Chapter to a
Love Affair.
Colonel "William J. Sutherland's trou
blea are still in the embryonic state. Con
rad Keeker, who a short time ago sued
his wife. Amber Fecker, for divorce, al
leging infidelity as a cause of action and
naming Colonel Sutherland as co-respond
ent, yesterday filed suit against the colo
nel to recover $50,000 damages foV the
alienation of his wife's affections and the
discomfort he has suffered through her
unexplained absence. Mr.' Pecker's wife
i associated with Colonel Sutherland under
the name of Mrs. Jennie J. Webber, and
this woman's attempt to make the col
on.-1 pay for his lavishing of affections
upon her has long been a matter of pub
lic gossip.
During the month of August, 1898, the
j plaintiff alleges, while be was living hap
! plly with and supported his wife, Mrs.
: Amber Fecker, at 308 Leavenworth street,
Colonel Sutherland wrongfully intending
to injure him and deprive him of the so
ciety and services of his wife, maliciously
enticed her away from her home and
persuaded her to take a trip with him
to Sacramento. There, it is alleged, the
colonel wined and dined the fair Mrs.
Amber, and succeeded in keeping her
away from home and husband for a pe
riod of several days. At a later date,
namely, in the month of March. 1899. it is
i alleged that Colonel Sutherland again
| stole the innocent Mrs. Fecker away and
enticed her to take a trip with him to
I various towns and places in the State of
I Nevada and this State, and that by his
; praise and flatteries, as well as by his
I constant expression of admiration for th*
i erring wife and by making h<r presents
of fancy articles, he gained her love and
affection to such an extent that he gained
and exercised complete influence and con
trol over her.
Owing to his wife's infatuation for Col
onel Sutherland, Fecker alleges that she
deserted him April 21, and has since re
fused to return to his bed and board. In
conclusion Fecker alleges that Colonel
Sutherland has his wife secreted in some
! place unknown, for all of which wrong-
I ful acts he prays damages in the sum of
! $50,000 and costs of action.

SLIPPED ON THE ROOF
AND FELL TO HIS DEATH
EDWARD KERRIGAN, a house
painter. was instantly killed
yesterday morning shortly after
he had gone to work on a two
story frame building on Pine street,
near Scott. He and E. J. Marley, his
employer, bad arranged a swinging
stace on which they were to stand
while working, and placed it in the
front yard preparatory to suspending
it against the side of the building.
Kerrigan went on the roof with the
hooks and tackle to fasten the staging,
and before he had made two steps he
slipped on the shingles, which had
been wet by the rain, and fell back
ward off tlie roof, striking upon his
head on the staging and receiving in
juries from which he died before the
ambulance carrying him had reached
the City Receiving Hospital. The jaw
and skull of the unfortunate man were
fractured, and he never recovered
consciousness.

STEAMER FOR
THE SANTA FE'S
FERRY BUSINESS
Ocean Wave Arrives
From Puget Sound.
SHE IS A VERY FAST BOAT
IS FOR THE POINT RICHMOND
SAN FRANCISCO RUN.
Was Formerly an Excursion Steamer
on the Columbia River, Running
Between Portland and
Seaside.
One of the fastest ferry boats on the
coast arrived in port from Puget Sound
yesterday. She is the side-wheel steam
ef Ocean Wave and tins been purchased
by the Santa Ke railroad for the Point
Richmond service. It will take about
two months to get her in shape for ferry
business, as she Is fitted out with Btate
rooms and has a straight bow. The
staterooms will all be torn out and the
bow will have to be rounded out like
those on the Oakland ferry boats so that
she will fit the landing slips at this end
and Point Richmond.
The Ocean Wave is ISO feet long, 29
feet beam and 9 feet deep, or a little
smaller than the San Rafael, which ferry
boat she very much resembles. She is
fitted with twin engines and can easily
make her fourteen knots an hour, or
about the speed made by the San Rafael
when on her best behavior. She was
built in ]\'M on the Columbia River for
Jacob Kamm, the millionaire steamboat
man, to run in the excursion business be
tween Portland and Seaside. For over
six years she was one of the most suc
cessful hoa^|| on the run, and then she
was ><M to Puget Sound purties. The
latter paid a fancy price for her. Intend
ing to run her in the Klondike trade, but
when the bottom fell out of that trad.
there was nothing for her to do and she
was put up for sale and purchased by the
Santa Fe.
The Ocean Wave left Port Angeles- in
tow of the tug Holyoke at 9:30 o'clock
on Saturday night. She was all boarded
up in case i< sea should break aboard,
and water ballast was used. Exception
ally fine weather was experienced all the
way down and the last day out the water
ballast was pumped out in order to light
en the tow. This enabled the Holyoke
to come along at a better speed, with the
result that ihv vessels reached port a
day before they 'were expected.
The ocean Wave had not been tied up
at Washington Btreet wharf an hour be
fore carpenters were at work on her.
There are fifty staterooms on the main
deck and over a hundred on the upper
deck, all of which will be torn out. The
upper deck will then be fitted up as a
luxurious saloon, while the lower one
will be prepared for freight. The Ocean
Wave is a "single-ender. Sh*> is again
like the San Rafael in this respect, all
the other ferry boats being "double-end -
ers." The work of getting her ready for
service will be rushed, and it is expected
that she will be ready for business about
tbÂ« first of August.
Several BUgar boats made port yester
day. The barkentines S. N. Castle and
â S. G. Wilder had another race and the
Castle won by twenty-four hours. These
two vesssels nearly always arrive and
sail within a few hours of each other,
and if one wins in the run to Honolulu
the other turns the tables coming to San
Francisco. The Castle was twenty days
and the Wilder twenty-one days coming
up, while the bark Albert made the run
in eighteen days, beating them both. AH
three boats beat the barks Martha Davis,
now out twenty-two days; Ceylon, twen
ty-four days, and Alden Besse, twenty
nine days.
The San Bias arrived from Panama
and way ports yesterday. She had few
passengers but a large cargo, the prin-

Crossley of the navy, who is assigned as
flag lieutenant to the Baltimore in Ma
nila. This young officer distinguished
himself in Cuban waters by sinking two
of the Spanish gunboats with the United !
States tug Leydou. While cruising about
the waters of Santiago he was pursued !
by a small gunboat flying the Spanish '
flag. In order to give the enemy a fight
ing chance he waited until the vessel got
within range of his gun, when he opened
fire on her and had the satisfaction of
seeing her go to the bottom of the ocean.
He repeated the operation on the next
gunboat that tackled him and got away
clear without any injury to himself or his
; vessel.
For this heroic conduct he was pro-
I moted to the rank of junior lieutenant
commander and ordered to Manila for
duty.
Young Crossley is a native of Ohio, but
was appointed to the navy from Connec
i ticut. On his visit here he availed him
self of the pleasure of calling on : Frank

JURY FOUND
TO CONVICT
POKER PLAYERS
Fourth Trial Proves
Successful.
JURY OUT HALF AN HOUR
L. H. HANSE-i OF THE METRO
POLE SALOON THE VICTIM.
The Jury Qualifies the Verdict With
a Recommendation to the Ex
treme Mercy of the
Court.
For the first time since the crusade
against the poker rooms on Market street
was inaugurated has a jury brought in a
verdict In favor of decency and morality,
but it was accompanied with a recom
mendation to the extreme mercy of the
court.
The case was that of Ij. H. Hansen.
proprietor of the Metropole saloon. 77.~>
Market street, who was charged before
acting Police Judge Groezinger with per
mitting a percentage game of poker to
be played In his saloon. The case was
called last week, but only ten jurors out
of a venire of forty were accepted. An ad
ditional venire of fifteen was Issued and
yesterday afternoon the other two jurors
were procured. The jurors accepted
were: J. Neustadter, W. T. Dunn, E. W.
Strange, I. Menser, G. Lubbe, George
Vincent, James Price, T. Broderick, J.
Cavanaugh, C. Brown, A. C. Pascoe and
\V. Loring.
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter con
ducted the prosecution, and the defendant
was represented by Attorney Sanderson.
Policemen G. W. Tracey and F. W. Esola
testified to seeing two hands played in
the clubroom of the saloon on April 24.
and saw John Mason, the conductor of
the. game, take out chips from the cen
ter of the table. They saw no drinks.
Hales.
cigars or sandwiches served to the play
ers while they were watching the two
games.
The defense called John Mason, the
conductor of the game, and the defend
ant, and they were questioned as to the
chips being taken out for drinks, cigars
or sandwiches, but Carpenter objected to
such testimony unless it could be shown
that the drinks, cigars or sandwiches
were supplied to the players while the po
lice were there, and the objection was
sustained. H. Rels was also called for
the defense, but Carpenter objected to
his testimony and it was stricken out.
Counsel addressed the jury, and the
Prosecuting Attorney paid particular at
tention to the meaning of the word per
centage, and contended that the men?
fact that the conductor of the game took
a portion of the chips from the table
proved that what was taken was a per
centage of the whole.
The Judge in his charge to the jury said
among other things: "While the ordl
. nary game of poker Is not prohibited by
I law", still if such game is so played that
I a person who conducts and carries on the
', game but not participating in the play
I takes out a part or portion of the money
or checks as representatives of value
from such money or checks played for as
a percentage for himself, then such game
| would be a percentage game within the
meaning of the statute. It would be im
material whether or not anything in th-3
shape of drinks, cigars, etc., was after
ward furnished to the players." The
i Judge also charged that it was not neces
sary for the prosecution to prove the ex
act percentage taken.
The jury retired and after being out
for about half an hour returned with a
verdict of guilty, but with a recommenda
tion to the extreme mercy of the court.
The Judge ordered the defendant to ap
pear for sentence to-day.
WEATHER BUREAU'S WORK
IN EASTERN COLLEGES
SYSTEM MAY BE INTRODUCED i
IN THIS STATE.
Chief Moore Tells of Excellent Re
sults by Co-operation in Train
ing Men in Meteorology.
It is more than likely that the co-opera
tion now existing between the Weather
j Bureau and the Department of Agricul-
I ture and certain Eastern colleges will be I
( extended to this coast so as to include |
the California and Stanford universities. I
I Chief Willis L.. Moore, acting under the j
I specific directions of Secretary James j
Wilson, has already arranged co-opera- I
tion with the Ohio State University, Johns
Hopkins University and the University of
Tennessee with such excellent results
that the system will he introduced into '<
other institutions of learning.
Forecast Official McAdie states that j
Professor Moore is an enthusiast on the
subject and has established by his ef
forts a close relationship between edu
cational institutions and the scientific de
partments of the Government. In dis
cussing the subject recently Professor
Moore said: ,
"The study of meteorology is becoming
a most important one, and as a rule only
graduates of universities and scientific
schools have the necessary educational
foundation for its practical pursuit. It is
for that reason that the Department of
Agriculture is introducing the work of
co-operation in the universities wherever
found feasible. In some cities the offices
of the Weather Bureau are located in
the university buildings. A complete
meteorological observatory is maintain!
to which the students are given full ac
cess. Lectures by bureau officials are
included in the college curriculum and
substantial results are obtained in tin
fitting of technically trained men for ag
ricultural work. The Secretary has di
rected that student observers be em
ployed at weather stations, so as to per
mit poor but ambitious boys to get a col
lege education.
"The agricultural colleges endowed by
Congress are educating men in the
science relating to agriculture, and sin'h
men may now bo had who are competent
to report intelligently on the productions \
of the country. They keep the farmers i
of the United" States informed regarding
crops, markets a.-l their tendencies much
more accurately than agents not scien
tifically educated. There is a large and
| growing need tor such men. and the de
partment desires to foster their advance
ment. There an- about twenty-five young
I men working out their scholarships in
different subordinate capacities in the
weather service."
