SAYS MR. HULL
WASHINGTON, April
12.â The Call's exclu
sive cablegram from
Auckland concerning the latest
fight in Samoa was the only in
formation at hand at the War
Department early this morning,
and was. eagerly discussed. It
was confirmed some hours later
by a cablegram from Admiral
Kautz.
The possibility of very grave
consequences resulting from the
collision at Apia lies in the com
plicated circumstances surround
ing the case. If the ambuscade
in which the American and Brit
ish officers and sailors were killed
was actually led or instigated by
a German, as indicated in the
news dispatches, it would still be
a simple matter for Germany to
disavow the act and punish the
offender. The trouble is, how
ever, that this ambuscade does
not stand by itself. The instiga
tion in hostilities in Samoa is
charged to the German Consul,
and this latest bloodshed in
which the responsibility of a Ger
man is indicated is but a develop
ment in hostilities growing out
of the dispute in which German

officials assume N an attitude ad

The situation .is still further
complicated by the statements
quoted in the Associated Press
dispatches from Berlin as official
from a representative of the
German Foreign Office. The
tone of these utterances is so de
fiant and so far in conflict with
the attitude assumed by the Ger
man Embassador at Washington
that even before news of the col
lision at Apia was received the
situation was looked upon as par
taking of a more serious aspect
than had been before anticipated.
The course of the German Em
bassy at Washington in com
munication with the State De
partment since the first outbreak
of the trouble in Samoa has ap
peared conciliatory, and the
agreement on the commission
was looked upon as assuring a
peaceful settlement. This Gov
ernment has had reason to be
lieve that Germany had no pur
pose to sustain the German Con
sul, and that his proclamation

would be repudiated. Therefore
SAN FRANCISCO, THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1899.
THE CALL BEATS THE WORLD.
On the morning of January 18 The Call, by special cablegram from
Auckland, first gave to the world the story of the beginning of the
present trouble in Samoa.
Mataafa. taking up arms in rebellion against a decision of Chief
Justice Chambers declaring Malietoa Tanu King, had overturned the
Berlin treaty, defied the powers and set up a government of his own.
Yesterday morning The Call once more beat the newspaper
world in printing the news that American and English blood had been
shed in Samoa, that the savages under Mataafa had ambushed a
party of bluejackets near Apia.
A news service such as this, reaching more than half around the
world, needs little comment. The Call never has spared and never
will spare expense to Â£ive its readers not only all the news all the
time, but the best of the news ahead of its contemporaries. Steal
ing and garbling The Call's specials will not aid the beaten ones.
Extras issued in spasmodic jerks after the event do not cover a news
beating. The Call's copyrighted cablegram from Samoa was in every
copy of The Call printed yesterday. To-day The Gall has carried it to
the remotest corners of the State. Â»
The achievement is the most splendid ever placed to the credit of
a newspaper in San Francisco. In passing it may be observed that
The Call will continue to cover the Samoan field and all news fields
as no other newspaper in San Francisco can.
the apparently sudden veering
about of the Berlin Foreign Of
fice causes great surprise. The
statement attributed to an offi
cial of the Berlin Foreign Of
fice, published this: morning,
that Great Britain and the
United States must make an un
mistakable disavowal of the ac
tion of their naval commanders,
together with the alleged official
statement by the Berlin Foreign
Office the day before sustaining
Consul Rose and charging vio
lation of the treaty by American
and British officers, places the
matter in an entirely different as
pect from that anticipated by
reason of the attitude of the Ger
man Embassy here, and a suspi
cion of' double "dealing " has been
aroused in some quarters.

AUCKLAND, N. Z., April
â 9 a. m. : â Further ad
vices from Apia, Samoa,
say that on the arrival of the
British cruiser Tauranga at
Apia the British and American
Consuls issued a proclamation to
give Mataafa a last chance, and
that the French priests also used
their influence, but all efforts
failed, and the rebels continued
their depredations. Property
was destroyed . and bridges and
roads were barricaded.
On March 29 the enemy was
sighted at Maguigi and machine
guns and a seven-pounder were
used. The- friendlies, Malietoa's
men, also attacked the enemy
during the latter's retreat and
several rebels were killed or
wounded.
' The friendlies carried one
head through Apia, which made
Captain Stuart so furious that he
went to the King and threatened
to shoot any man found taking
heads. The King then issued a
proclamation, forbidding the
practice.
The German Consul wrote to

The admiral replied, agreeing
with the Consul as to the inhu

pointed out that had "the Ger

there would have been no blood

Samoan one, but first made

Washington Authorities Say That

Special Dispatch to The Call.
. WASHINGTON, April 12.â The acute
situation in Samoa gave rise to grave
apprehension among officials during the
early day in Washington, but the con
clusion was reached as the departments
closed that the situation is one that
will yield to sensible and cool treat
ment if all the parties .to the Berlin
treaty are sincere in an effort to pre
vent further trouble. As put by a Cab
inet officer, the killing of the sailors
has not materially changed the general
problem, though it has undoubtedly
added to the difficulty of dealing with
the specific situation.
The only officjal news received touch
ing the last incident was contained in
Admiral Kautz's cablegram. The Sec
retary said that no additional instruc
tions were to be sent by him to the
admiral. The Secretary of State, how
ever, has been told that he is at liberty
i to forward any instruction to the ad
miral that he may deem necessary, but
1 that if he concludes to .do so he must
act immediately, as the mail steamer
leaves the nearest cable point for Apia
to-morrow. The Philadelphia was
short-handed for officers before the
loss of Lieutenant Lansdale and En
sign Monaghan, and the department
to-day promptly sent telegraphic orders
to Mare Island to dispatch some officers
to recruit the force. Lieutenant
Schuetze goes out as executive officer,
with Lieutenant W. S. Hughes, Lieu
tenant Schofield and Lieutenant Heth
erington. Surgeon Steele is ordered
from the New York navy yard to the
Philadelphia. All of these officers are
expected to take the mail steamer on
th* 19th inst. for Apia.
The diplomatic negotiations of the
day were not directed particularly to
the encounter, as the official informa
tion is too meager thus far to warrant
positive official action. There were
many inquiries, however, and the State
Department and the British and Ger
man embassies exchanged such advices
a* they. had on the subject. In the
main, the diplomatic negotiations con
tinued to center around the high com- '
mission. On this subject a breach is '
gradually opening between Great Brit
ain and Germany, because of the re- '
fusal of Great Britain to have the com- I
mission leave San Francisco on the !
19th.
While the Germans are anxious and
our officials are willing that the start ;
should be made on the 19th, Great Brit- '
am insists on proceeding with delibera
tion, allowing full time for instructions
to the British Commissioner by mail
and not by cable. This, of course,
would make it impossible for the com- j
mission to leave in a body this month.
To overcome this stand by the British
Foreign Office a suggestion has been !
made that the appointment of an um
pire which is one of the points still in
dispute, be settled after the Commis
sioners start. If this is agreed to, the
commission can be away, though with
some branches of its instructions in
complete. In the meantime they could I
be making their preliminary examina- '
tions, the final directions being reserved !
until complete instructions were in
hand. This German proposal does not
meet with favor among the British
officials, who have determined that the 1
British Commissioner, Mr. Eliot, shall
not leave "until his. functions can be ex- j
actly defined.
The following German official view j
was given to the Associated Press:
"After Germany and the United !
States had arrived at an understanding \
that the commission could have left |
San Francisco on the 19th, England
raises new difficulties of such compli
cated nature that they cannot be dealt ;
with telegraphically.
I "Germany feels justified under these

circumstances to hold the name of her
Commissioner still back. The Berlin
news that Germany would demand sat
isfaction Cor the arbitrary action of
Admiral Kautz is not credited in Ger
man official circles and seems to be a,
malicious invention. The whole ques
tion on account of Samoa is pending at
present, not between the three powers,
but between Germany and England."
Lieutenant Freeman, killed in Samoa,
is given in the British naval list as
Angel H. Freeman, the senior lieu
tenant of the cruiser Tauranga, the
next to Captain Stuart in command of
the vessel. '_â¢','. ':<;.â 
The British Admiralty has a number
of warships not far from Samoa in the
Australasian islands, a special design
of small cruisers being used in that lo
cality. The chief naval station accessi
ble to Samoa is on the China coast,
where the Asiatic squadron embraces
some of the largest warships in the
British navy. In number, armament
and tonnage the British ships on this
station far exceed those of Germany
or any other power.
The chief German station near
Samoa is also on the China coast at
Kiaochau, where Admiral Prince Henry
is in command. ; !â¢:;â¢_
Admiral Dewey's fleet at Manila is
the nearest assemblage of American
warships to Samoa. The sailing time
from Manila to Samoa is about four
teen days. â  -'â !*',.'*
The arrest and retention by the
British naval officials of a German sub
ject is one of the most dangerous fea
tures of the controversy. It is said
that the Consuls of the three powers
stationed at Apia claim , extraterri
torial jurisdiction, involving the right
to try the subjects of their respective
countries for any offenses alleged to
have been committed. Under this prac
tice the German Consul Rose may de
mand the surrender of the German.
If the man is guilty it is considered im
probable that the British will yield un
less upon some adequate guarantee
that he is to be sufficiently punished.
It is not believed likely that Rose will
make such, promise.
It is believed that Admiral Kautz,
with the co-operation of the British,
will continue his efforts to bring the
rebellious natives to terms. This is
not likely to be an easy task, in view
of the somewhat small force at his
command, but it is said the British
Government may accept the proposition
of the authorities of New Zealand to
send a regiment of soldiers to Samoa.
No protest thus far has been lodged at
the State Department against Admiral
Kautz. SE-SI
At the British and German embas
sies the news of the bloody conflict in
Samoa was received with deep concern.
Sir Julian Pauncefote expressed his
profound regret at the collision at a
moment when he had hoped the trouble
was in a fair way to adjustment.
Mr. Eliot, the British High Commis
sioner to Samoa, also deplored the
event. The British officials were quite
confident, however, that the chances of
a settlement would not be destroyed by
this affair, although they might be
somewhat embarrassed.
At neither of the embassies had a
word of official information been re
ceived and the press accounts were
therefore scanned with great interest.
The German Embassador, Dr. yon Hc,-I
leben, stated that while he was wholly
without official advices he deeply re
gretted to hear that there had been fur
ther loss of life. . In all. diplomatic
quarters there was a ' disposition to
treat the news as grave, but not as
disrupting the plans for a settlement.
The President received dispatches
from Auckland soon after he entered
his office. Secretary Long called with
the cablegram from Admiral -Kautz.
They remained in conference less than
half an hour. The Secretary seemed
to view the matter with perfect equa
nimity and said that no additional force
would be sent to Apia as our present
strength there was deemed amply suf
ficient, to meet the situation. The Sec
retary also said that Admiral Kautz's
dispatch contained matters not made
public, but they were of no general in
terest. The dispatch, however, he said,
contained no mention of the ambush
having been laid on the plantation of
a German. â¢v, V,'".' ; ;
Members of the Cabinet in discussing
the event said they saw no occasion for
public excitement. The United States
would protect her rights, but until all
the facts were known it was certain
no aggressive steps .would be taken.
It was further stated that on the face
of the records the German Government
was not unfriendly to the United States
during our war with Spain and al
though certain German officials may
have shown a pronounced sympathy
with the Spaniards, nothing had oc
curred that could officially be a sub
ject of complaint that had not been
promptly disavowed. Under these cir
cumstances it is pointed out that the
United States will not be disposed to
assume in advance of the receipt of full
information that the German Govern
ment is solely responsible for the pres
ent disturbed state of affairs 'at Apia.
Members of the Cabinet were not in
clined to regard seriously the intima
tion of some of the German" papers that
I the United States should be required
I to disavow the acts of Admiral Kautz.
BRITISH ADVICES
% ARE CONSERVATIVE
So Far the United States Has
Not Followed England in
Sending More Force.
WASHINGTON, April 12.â Both the
British and German embassies here to
night received long cablegrams from
their Foreign Offices reporting on the
developments in- Samoa. That from
London was from the British Consul at
Apia and said that the casualties were
one British officer killed, two or three
Americans killed and ; five â¢ American
sailors wounded, with two English
sailors wounded. .The purport of the
German dispatch is not known. It
reached here about 8" o'clock and took
an hour and a half to decipher.
. The dispatch to the British embassy
was in the main a confirmation of facts
given in the press dispatches. It was
conservative in tone and announced at
the outset that a collision had occurred
on a plantation near Apia between the
native force's and a combined American
and English detachment. One point of
significance to the embassy was the
fact that it apparently contradicted a
published report of a large number of
casualties on the side of the joint
American-English forces. Another im
portant point was that it announced
only one British officer killed.
The action of Great Britain in or
dering two more warships to Samoa at
tracted considerable attention here and
it was stated that if the British ships
are so reinforced Germany would take
similar steps and augment her naval
representation in those waters to. meet
any .possible contingency. ,'. â >
So far, however, no action looking to
reinforcement of the United States'
naval forces has been taken. Secretary
Long was informed of Great Britain's
action late to-night, but said it as his
belief that there was adequate repre
sentation of the United. States there
now and that no more vessels would be
dispatched to Samoa unless further im
portant developments occur. The Phil
adelphia, he said, with the two British
ships, was fully able to cope with the
situation in the present light of events.
Admiral Kautz has not requested any
reinforcements, and his recommenda
tion under ordinary circumstance
would be awaited. gÂ£Â£3j
Requests for information about those
who fell In the savage ambuscade be
gan coming in to-night, the first mes
sage reaching Secretary Long shortly
before midnight from James Monaghan
of San Diego, asking for details of the
death of his son. Ensign Monaghan.
The view is held in German circles
that much of the delay in settling the
Samoan troubles, as well as the grave
aspect the matter has assumed, is due
to a design on the part of Great Britain
to ing about an alliance with the
United States.

Berlin Officials Say Prompt Steps
Should Be Ta^en to Suppress
Mataafa's Murderous Warriors.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gordon Bennett.
BERLIN, April 12. â Up to a late hour to-night lights burned in the Foreign Office,
where much agitation reigned during the afternoon owing to the latest news from- Samoa.
The ambushing of the American and English detachment by ' Mataafa's warriors is taken
here in the most serious light. A dispatch which reached the Minister of State from Consul Rose
is taken as clearly exonerating the Germans from any hand in the matter, as was at first feared
might possibly be the case.
Only this afternoon have the negotiations between the German and British govern
ments reached an absolutely satisfactory condition, and the German Government ascribes this to
the good influence of the United States Government. This has removed the obstacle to Ger
many at once naming her Commissioner, who, am informed this evening at the Foreign Office,
will be the First Secretary of the German Embassy in Washington.
A personage in a position .to speak authoritatively says the reports in the German papers
that the German Government will put in a claim for damages are untrue. All such questions as
that are entirely matters for the consideration of the Commissioners. All this Samoan question
is a small but wretched business, for which it seems a terrible pity that 400,000 marks' worth of
German property has been damaged and the lives of American and English seamen have been
needlessly sacrificed.
The Foreign Office has received several dispatches from the commander of the cruiser
Falke, in which he makes no mention of any disagreeable discussion with Admiral Kautz. The
German Government takes this as sufficient proof that all the stories told on the subject must
therefore have been the inventions of persons interested in making trouble between Germany
and the United States. *
BERLIN, April 12.â The correspon
dent here of the Associated Press
has had an interview with a For
eign Office official, who is author
ized to speak for the Minister of
Foreign Affairs, Baron yon Bulow. He
said:
.'We have received several official
dispatches saying that the Tanu people
for a fortnight __ast have been raiding
and pillaging around Apia, destroying
mainly German property. They are
armed with weapons furnished by the
British.
""We also received to-day a dispatch
from the commander of the Falke con
firming the ambuscade and the loss of
the Americans and English, substanti
ating wholly the dispatches of the As
sociated Press. The ambuscade may
possibly have been on a German plan
: tation, as nearly all the property
around Apia is German. The Govern
ment regrets extremely the occurrence,
, ; for which, however, it is in no way to
blame. Such hostile encounters must
naturally be expected when the Anglo-
American action in crowning Malietoa
Tanu has made nine-tenths of the Sa
moans their enemies. It shows strongly
how necessary is the prompt departure
of the commission with adequately full
instructions. Although the German
Commissioner has not been formally
f appointed, he is ready to start for Sa
moa within half an hour after the three
Governments clearly define the mode of
operations and the powers of the com
mon. Why does England need
lessly delay agreeing? It is the only
way to prevent ceaseless bloodshed in
Samoa. Unless the commission starts
soon such encounters may occur any
day.
"Of course, now that fresh blood has
been spilled, the excitement of the
Americans and British may increase.
But Germany is blameless. The same
thing happened to our men in 1888. The
Samoans also cut off the heads of the
German victims then. That is one of
the Samoans' pleasant habits. If Ad
miral Kautz' had the power to re-estab
lish peace all might be well. But he
needs a much stronger force than now
available under his and the British
command at Apia to subdue Mataafa
and his warlike hosts."
The correspondent also saw United
Stat Embassador White, who said he
had not received any official news* of
the recent occurrences at Apia, and
Therefore was unable to comment upon
the ambuscade.
The Lokal Anseiger, the only after
noon newspaper here containing the ex
citing moan news, does not comment
upon it.

source that the Washington Govern

BERLIN, April 12.â of
ficial dispatch from Apia dated
April 5 says: "The British
have been bombarding a Sa
moan village daily, and the
adherents of Mataafa are
plundering foreign property.
"On April 1 an Anglo-Amer
ican landing party fell into
an ambuscade near Vailele.
Three officers were killed and
two light guns were captured.
The warships afterward re
newed the bombardment."
The officials here point out
that the engagement appeared

treaty rights, and adds that it has rea
son to know the German Government
has asked for a definite statement as
to the position of the British Govern
ment toward the Samoan treaty.
Sir Frank Lascelles, the British Em
bassador, conferred with Baron yon
Bulow, the German Foreign Minister,
until a late hour this evening. The re
sult of the conference has not yet de
veloped definitely, but it is said that
an agreement was reached respecting
the commission.
Evidently the Government is doing
its utmost to avoid irritating Great
Britain and the United States. It had
the dispatch from Apia early this
morning, but refrained from publishing
the contents because it did not desire to
exhibit a mischievous pleasure at the
ambush of British and Americans.
The same motive forbade the semi
official papers to publish or comment
upon the news in a tone open to the
suspicion of cynicism.
Baro-n yon Bulow deprecates any at
tempt to complicate the situation by
needless interpellations, but he has con
sented to reply to an interpellation by
a member of the National Liberal party
in the Reichstag to-morrow or Friday,
stipulating, however, that the inquiry
shall deal with the general situation
only and contain nothing offensive to
Great Britain or the United States. This
appears to confirm the report that the
visit of Sir Frank Lascelles has had
a definite result, since, until to-night,
Baron yon Bulow had declined to con
sent to interpellations.
It is understood that if a German
should prove to have been reponsible
for the treachery, the Government will
acknowledge his liability to punish
ment.
As a specimen of the excitement pre
vailing in Chauvinist quarters, the
agrarian newspaper Tages Zeitung
publishes a violent manifesto calling
upon the women of Germany to con
tribute a navy fund as a protest
against the act of the United States
and Great Britain in "trampling Ger
many's honor in the dust." The
manifesto is signed "A German Frau."
The radical papers comment upon it
satirically, one ot them remarking,
"Get thee to a ntmnery, Ophelia."
The Vossische Zeitung observes that
the previous navy fund provided about
enough money to buy a lifeboat.

with official communications, but
| it is not believed that the press
dispatch purporting to give an
official statement of such charac
\ ter would be permitted to be sent
â  from Berlin if it were not actually
; authorized.
Senator Davis, chairman of
the Senate Committee on For
eign Relations, was one of the
earliest of the President's visitors
to-day. Trie President did not
mention the latest advices from
Samoa, but the Senator had been
informed of them. Asked for his
views -the situation, Davis
said:
"We must be care
ful and not lose our
heads. We must not
form an opinion till all
the facts are known."
Representative Hull of lowa,
chairman of the House Military
Committee, was also one of the
President's visitors, but he was
not consulted on the matter. He
spoke decidedly, however, say
ing:
'â¢This Government
will notattempttodis
credit our men there
unless it is shown
clearly thattheyare in
the wrong, If Germany
persists in her pres
ent course there ii^ay

of the country the
feeling has been very
strong against Ger
many for six months.
The people believe
that she was hostile
to us in the war with
| Spain. The people are
in such temper that
they will not permit
any trifling or hedging
on the part of the
United States."
Senator Thurston said that
it would be pretty hard for three
of the most enlightened nations
of the earth to have a war over
a few. little islands which are of
no consequence. He considered
the situation as somewhat grave.
Senator Stewart said: ''Does

Germany want to fight? If so,
she way be accommodated. We
are a peaceful people, but. we do
not permit others to go around
with. chips on their shoulders," '
There was a feeling ' among
many of the statesmen that the
outcome of this whole affair will
depend largely on Great Britain's
attitude. England, it is said, may
see her opportunity in the Sa
moan situation, and the United
States may be put in the position
of having to follow her. Eng
land may have concealed motives
for a rupture with Germany,
while the Samoan situation
would furnish apparent grounds
for a break. It is argued that if
England has any desire to even
up with Germany she will never
be able to do so under more fa
vorable circumstances.
CABLE FROM GERMANY
TO UNITED STATES
NEW YORK, April 12.â A Washing
ton special. to the Herald says: Presi
dent McKinley has granted /permission
to the Felton Guilleaume, a German
corporation, to, land on the â¢ Atlantic
Coast its proposed cable between Ger
many and the United States.'
The request, "which was made by the
German Government through' its Em
bassador in Washington, was for a
landing near Coney Island, but under
the permit granted the company may
put a cable ashore at almost any point.
The â¢ President granted the request
willingly, not only because It will, give
the United States another trans-
Atlantic line, but also because it will
please many German-American citizens
of the United States, who have not
looked with entire favor on the recent
growth of cordial relations between the
United States and Great Britain. â â¢--
The new cable will bring the United
States and Germany into closer com
mercial , relations, and, it is believed,
will tend to counteract the bad feel
ing in both countries over the action of
the German/admiral at Manila and the
present Samoan difficulties. â¢" '
The granting of. the permit just at
this time, when the situation in Samoa
is particularly strained, will tend to
demonstrate that the United States
wishes to pursue a conciliatory course.

COMPLICATIONS IN
SAMOA MADE STILL
GRAVER BY ATTACK.
LONDON, April 12.â outbreak
in Samoa, just when the powers
had agreed upon the appointment
of a commission to settle the dif
ficulties there, has caused great
annoyance and disappointment at the
Foreign Office here, where it is re
garded as making the already serious
complications still graver. While they
have difficulty in expressing a definite
opinion upon the fresh development, it
is acknowledged that the foreign offi
cials think that it has been manifested
that there. has been hasty and aggres
sive action on the part of Herr Rose,
the German Consul, for although he
may have- many technical reasons for
the part he has played in behalf of
German interests, it is asserted that he
has been -the prime cause of the fresh
outbreak, which, it is added, will neces
sarily greatly. embarrass the. endeavors
which the three powers are making to
restore a satisfactory and amicable
state of: affairs. : V . ' :.â¢..-
The Foreign Office officials appear to
think that it was obviously the duty of
the three Consuls to uphold the decision
of the Supreme Court, which, . accord
ing to the telegrams received, decided
to reinstate Tanu in place of the pro
visional government, and the action' of
Herr Rose in issuing a counter procla- !
mation supporting the rebellious fac
tion could not but have a. disastrous!
effect, as shown by the fighting ' de
scribed in to-day's dispatches.
Furthermore, the officials of the For
eign Office think it impossible to say
to a certainty how events will develop,
but they -are" of the opinion that it is
high time the commissioners ' got ; to
work, in order to settle-once for all the
i deplorable' state of affairs which has
arisen in : Samoa. The dispatch to the
British Admiralty- from Apia, after giv- ;
ing the list of killed and wounded,
adds: "The British and .American au- >
thorities used their utmost endeavors
previous to the fighting ". to reach, a
peaceful settlement."
The treacherous attack made by the
i Mataafans upon, the .American arid
â  British naval forces created a consid
erable sensation in official circles and
among the general public. The news
papers sent out large placards' printed
with, such startling statements as
"British and American Forces Routed,"
"German Treachery," etc. -
The heroic conduct, of Ensign .Mon?
aghan .'of the, United States cruiser
Philadelphia particularly appealed to
the public. The British Admiralty has
received 'a ' dispatch* from Captain
Stuart, the senior British naval "officer
in Sa'mban' waters," giving the, news of
the death of Lieutenant -Freeman of
the British* cruiser Tauranga in "an
engagement with the rebels." Beyond
this no further 'details â¢ have been .re-,
ceived. ', - .'.''â... ' . r
The German Embassador here, Count
yon -Hatzfeldt-Wildenburg,- first- re
ceived the news from a representative
of. the Associated Press.. He- quickly
recognized its importance and asked
permission to make; a copy of, the dis
patch. He said: 'This news is, indeed,
grave and it is unfortunate, too,' at this
moment 'that anything, should occur to
endanger the negotiations. for .the set
tlement that we were glad to feel would
soon . have arrived. rOf course, I Can
not discuss the particulars given in the
dispatch, but the occurrence is certain
ly very unfortunate." .'.". ',-.'. â  ;.-â¢ '.
The Pall Mall 'Gazette, says: "The
locality of the /engagement .or; rather
ambush is stated to have been a Ger
man plantation, and there is : the- un
pleasant suggestion â  that there was
treachery upon 'the part of a German

spared this latest development. : We
may; be assured â¢ that, order will be

of the English ; and "American command

The Unitedâ- States-- Embassador,
Joseph R. Choate, having read! the Sa

of the Associated, Press: "And is Ger

UNANIMITY IN THE
SAMOAN COMMISSION
Lord Salisbury Definitely Announces
His Adhesion to This
Principle. .
LONDON, April 12.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Morning Post says:
Lord Salisbury, I learn, has definitely
announced his adhesion to the principle
of unanimity in the Samoan commis-
sion, although filled with grave appre
hensions as to the detrimental effect it
may have on the commission's useful
ness. The British and German gov
ernments have now arrived . at an
agreement.
The Berlin correspondent of the
Times says: The latest news from Sa
moa has elicited the keenest regret
here. It is regarded as showing that
Admiral Kautz : and Captain Sturdee
made a mistake in attempting to sup
press Mataafa with the small force at
their disposal. The Kreuz Zeitung says:
"We took too optimistic a view when
we drew the conclusion from Embassa
dor .White's declarations that Great
Britain and the United States had not
adopted an identical attitude in the
Samoan question. .
"The concentration of the German
press attacks now upon Great Britain
and now upon the United States sug
gests an ardent desire somewhere to
act upon the principle 'Divide et im
pera.' With regard to the appointment
of the commission, neither England nor
America can be accused of giving Ger
many any excuse for delay. If Ger
many "insists upon the principle of
unanimity in instructions to all com
missioners, she must at least give the
other powers time to consider this im
portant subject. It cannot be expected
that Mr, Eliot and. Mr. Tripp will take
their instructions ready made . from
Baron yon Bulow."

GALLANT LANSDALE
IS DEEPLY MOURNED
BY the death of Lieutenant Lans
dale a San Francisco girl was
made a widow before she had
been a wife a year. Three days
before the Philadelphia sailed for
Honolulu last summer the young naval
officer was married to Miss Ethel Ship
ley Smith by Rev. William H. Moreland
of St. Luke's Churchâ now Bishop
Moreland of the diocese of Sacramento
âin the little Episcopal Church in San
Rafael. The wedding was hastened be
cause of Lieutenant Lansdale's knowl
edge that 'he was liable *o he ordered
to sea at a day's notice..
Miss Smith was the eldest daughter
of Sidney M. Smith, well known in
business and financial circles in this
city, and the wedding was attended by
many friends of the happy couple. The
bride was attended by her sisters. Miss
Bertha and Miss Helen. Lieutenant
Gorgas, U. S. N., acted as best man
and the ushers were Edward Green
way, J. C. Morse Silverous, S. C. Board
man and Horace G. Piatt. After the
ceremony a wedding breakfast was
served at the summer home of the
bride's parents..
While the Philadelphia was at San
Diego last fall Mrs. Lansdale made a
trip to that port and remained with
her husband until the cruiser was bur
riedly dispatched to Samoa. She did
not realize when she bid her husband
good-by at that time that she would
never see him alive again. But the
young naval officer fell a victim to the
treachery of the savage warriors of
Mataafa. and the young widow is pros
trated v ith grief at the home of her
parents ai ".Yebster street and Broad
way. Her sisters are with her, but her
parents are absent in far-away Japan,
rhilip Van Home Lansdale was born
in Washington, D. C, February 15, ISSS.
He entered the naval academy at
Annapolis in IST*, and graduated in
1879. Three years later he was made
an ensign and assigned to duty at the
Washington Navy Yard, where he re
mained until IS9O, when he was ordered
to sea on the Philadelphia. In 1893 he
was sent to Chicago, where he had
charge of the caravels, and at the close
of the World's Columbian Exposition
he was promoted to a full lieutenancy
and ordered to the battle-ship" Massa
chusetts. A short time later he was
transferred to the Alert, and in June,
IS9S, he was ordered to Honolulu to
join the Philadelphia as navigation of
ficer. He was appointed executive
officer of the Philadelphia when the
cruiser was ordered to Samoa, succeed
ing Lieutenant Stevens, who was in
capacitated by illness. Lieutenant
Lansdale was very popular in society
circles in this city and enjoyed the
respect of his brother officers in the
navy to a marked degree.

pression of sympathy. Last June there
was a fashionable wedding at Sidney
Smith's summer home in San Rafael,
when the gallant officer took Ethel M.
Smith as his bride. The young lady was
well known in society circles here; her
winsome beauty and i cultured intellect
had made her nundreds of friends. The
marriage was .essentially a. love match.
and universal regret was expressed for
Mrs. Lansdale when the exigencies of
naval service took her husband from her
side. The lieutenant was only 41 years of
age, and had been in the navy ever since
he entered the Naval Academy at tne
early age of 16. His father-in-law, Sid
ney Smith, is well known as a local capi
talist and the president of the Cutting
Packing Company.
Charles S. Green, a California writer,
whose verse has won him much repute
and who is now editing the Overland
Monthly, is Mrs. Lansdale's uncle. Ife
states that the enforced separation of the
couple was the .source of deepest regret
to the whole family.
It had been expected prior to the out
break of the Samoan trouble that the
Philadelphia would, on the completion of
her South American cruise, return to San
Francisco and be permanently stationed
here. But when the Mataafa rebellion as
sumed serious dimensions the warship
was intercepted and Bent post haste to
Samoa with orders to protect American
interests in the group at all costs. How
well these instructions have been carried
out is shown by the sad news which
reached here yesterday.
"We feel," said Miss Smith, "that this
is a matter of international importance,
and. oh. we do hope that somebody will
do something to the Germans who caused
all the trouble. Of course we have not

FATHER GALLIANO HAS
GONE TO HIS REWARD
THE VENERABLE PRIEST DIED
YESTERDAY.
Formerly Taught at Santa Clara Col
lege, but Devoted His Last
Years to Charity.
Rev. Father Celestine Galliano died
shortly after 8 o'clock yesterday morning
at St. Ignatius College. During his life,
which extended over a period of sixty
three years, he was noted for his In
numerable charitable works, which won
for him the appellation "Father of the
Poor." He came to California in 1563, and
spent many years in teaching at Santa
Clara College, Santa Clara. After leav
ing the college, he went to Portland,
where he became a priest In IS7O.
In San Francisco his time was spent
within dingy prisons and hospitals, ad
ministering to the spiritual wants of
those confined therein. His kind and gen
tle nature endeared him to all with whom
he came in contact, and he made the last
hours of many lives of suffering peaceful
by his influence. He also visited the State
penitentiaries from time to time.
Father Galliano was born in Belluno
Italy, in 1835. His determination to de
vote his life to the. church was made in
his early life, and he went to Austria
where he studied for the holy orders'
hen he arrived in Boston some years
later he continued his theological studies
there. His last mass was said in his room
at the college two weeks ago.
This evening at 7:15 the body will be
taken into St. Ignatius Church, where the
rosary and the offices of the day will be
repeated. Friday morning at 7:30 a sol
emn mass of requiem will' be said, after
which the body will be taken to Santa

QUAY HAS GAINED
PARTIAL VICTORY
Judge Biddle Shuts Out
the "Red Book."
-â¢-...-â --.'â  â --.-* , ,
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, April -12.â Senator
Quay gained a partial advantage in
court to-day by the apparent refusal of
Judge Biddle for the present at least
to admit as evidence the famous
"red book," which has figured so
prominently, in the trial and which is
alleged to contain the key to the case
of the commonwealth. This book was
found in the desk of Cashier Hopkins
of the People's Bank after the institu
tion had closed its doors and that in
dividual had taken his own life. It is
an ordinary day book, twelve pages of
which are devoted to what the prose
cution claims to be Hopkins' record of
his transactions in money. deposited by
the State Treasurer for the advantage
of Senator Quay.
It contains entries extending over
several years and figures are written in
it which apparently show the calcula
tion of Interest on sums of money ap
proximating the State deposit, less cer
tain deductions for the .benefit of Sena
tor Quay. These figures, the prosecu
tion alleges, were "posted" from the red
book to the regular register of the bank
containing Quay's account. In passing
upon the question of the admissibility
of the red book Judge Biddle said:
It does not strike me that knowledge of
the book has been brought home to Quay.
It was not found among the books of
the bank at all. It was found in a drawer,
not in the ordinary shape in which books
of a public institution are kept, but
crowded in with a sort of rubbish, and an
investigation of that book revealed these
figures. . I am not satisfied, therefore,
that this book has been made competent
evidence against Senator Quay.
This decision was part of an oral
opinion by the Judge in which he estab
lished the point that the regular books
of the banks Were admissible as testi
mony. District Attorney Rothennel
quickly saw the advantage the latter
part of the opinion placed him in, and
he sprang to his feet to assure the court
that he had argued for the admission of
the "red book," and had not formally
offered it in evidence and might not
find it necessary to make such offer.
Judge Biddle replied that, he had un
derstood the argument of yesterday and
this morning to be on the admission of
all the books and papers, but in view
of Mr. Rothermel's statement he would
withhold his decision on this book until
it is regularly offered and the question
argued.
Counsel for Quay, seeing their advan
tage, insisted that they had included
the red book in their argument against
the admission of the books, but the
Judge dismissed the matter for the
present. -
SIDNEY A. MARTIN
ACCIDENTALLY KILLED
Shotgun Being Cleaned by the San
Franciscan Is Unexpectedly
.Discharged.
LOSANGELES, April 12.â Sidney A. Mar
tin of San Francisco, by the accidental
discharge of his shotgun, Inflicted a
wound in the abdomen which caused his
death in an hour. Martin came to Los
Angeles several days ago to visit friends.
Martin, ; with Albert Lang and A. N.
Heezklah. formed a camping party that
chose hunting grounds near San Fernando
as its rendezvous. They left Los Angeles
last Saturday. Desiring to replenish
their store of supplies they came, to San
Fernando in their wagon this morning.
Martin, who had been cleaning his gun,
was standing in the rear of the convey
ance, which had halted in front of the
postofflce. He placed the gun in the
wagonbed and looked into the barrel he
had cleaned. As he arose from a stoop
ing position, the gun was accidentally
discharged, the full load entering his
body. He was placed on a train that had
just arrived and conveyed to Los An
geles for medical treatment, but died en
route. ..: -'s-'
Martin was well known in San Francis
co, having been employed to- the Standard
Oil Company for the past fourteen years.
His widow and child, who reside at 1256
Eddy street, have been notified of his
! death and will reach here to-morrow
morning. The Coroner will hold an in
quest at 9:90 to-morrow morning and the
remains' will be shipped north at noon.
CHAUNCEY FILLEY'S PLAN
TO DEFEAT M'KINLEY
Missouri Republican Boss Would Put
an Independent Ticket Into
the Field.
NEW YORK. April 12.â A St. Louis
special to the Herald says: Chauncey I.
Fllley, erstwhile Republican boss of Mis
souri, Is, according to one of his lieu
tenants, at the head of a movement to
organize the antl-McKinley Republicans
of the country to work against the Presi
dent.for re-election.
The scheme contemplates the nomina
tion of an independent ticket after the
regular Republican convention, with Gov
ernor Plngree of Michigan and Mayor
Jones of Toledo, Ohio, as candidates for
President and Vice President, respec
tively. They hope to carry Illinois. lowa,
Indiana, Michigan and California, with
chances in Eastern and Western States.
The independent platform is to be muni
cipal ownership of public utilities and
probable Government ownership of rail
roads and telegraphs.
GRAND ARMY DEADLOCK.
PHILADELPHIA, April 12.â ex
ecutive committee of the National
Council of Administration of the Grand
Army of the Republic to-night failed to
elect a successor to the late James A.
Sexton, commander in chief of the
Grand Army. There was a deadlock
on the names of Colonel W. C. Johnson
of Cincinnati and General J. C. Black of
Illinois. Colonel Johnson will continue
to act as commander in chief until the
encampment here in September, when
a commander will be chosen.
POTATOES WORTH
AS MUCH AS EGGS
TACOMA, Wash., April 12.â Potatoes are now worth as much as
eggs in this State. People are buying them practically by the dozen.
They cost over 2 cents a pound and are growing scarcer every day. .
Last year was not a good one for potatoes in the Northwest, while
the demand was unusually heavy owing to the evaporation of large
quantities for the Alaskan and Klondike trade. In past years new
potatoes from California have been on the market by this time. Few
Californias have arrived 'so far, and .those to be had are not considered
up to the usual quality. This leaves a comparatively small quantity of
potatoes now available at the Sound and interior markets to supply
both this State and Alaska until the new crop can be harvested in Cali
fornia and Oregon. Â '.' I "-V'/ j "Â»s. ! \
Prices have gradually advanced until jobbers are now paying as
high as $42 a ton for good potatoes. Six months ago better potatoes
were sold in Yakima and Walla Walla valleys at $6 a ton. Local deal
ers believe the recent drought in California is the cause of the shortage
in this State. Onions, which are generally from two to three times as
dear as potatoes, may now be bought at. half the cost of ordinary
"spuds." A considerable quantity of potatoes. was evaporated last fall,
but prices now preclude drying them for shipment even to the golden
Klondike.
GENERALS WHEATON
AND LAWTON ARE
CHASING FILIPINOS
The Enemy in Full Retreat to the
Mountains, Burning Villages
Behind Them.
MANILA, April 12. â General
Wheatort ; started at daylight
â¢ with the Tenth Pennsylvania
and the Second Oregon regi
ments and two guns to drive
the rebels from the American right
flank between the railroad and the foot
hills. He met with slight resistance
near Santa Maria and had one man
wounded, but the enemy bolted when
shelled by the artillery and burned and
abandoned the town of Santa Maria,
where a thousand rebels were reported
to have been concentrated.
During the rest of the day the enemy
was in full retreat toward the moun
tains, burning the villages behind the
retreating force. Occasionally a few of
the rebels dropped to the rear and fired
at the advancing American troops from
the jungle, apparently with the idea
that this would check our advance and
.cover the retreat of the Filipinos. But
finding these tactics ineffectual these
rebels scrambled after the main body.
The American guard along the rail
road has been materially strengthened
and it is not likely the rebels will suc
ceed in getting in the future to as close
quarters as they did yesterday even if
they return from the mountains.
General Wheaton has telegraphed to
Major General Otis saying: "They
would not wait to be killed."
General Lawton is scouring the vicin
ity of Santa Cruz. He finds the rebels
have decamped. He has secured a
gunboat, six launches and two cascoes,
comprising the Filipino fleet. The ves
sels were stuck in the mud of the river
and Major General Otis has sent a
dredge to the spot. .V;
The United States Philippine Com
mission is hearing the leading residents
of various nationalities, priests and
Spaniards, numbers of them appearing
voluntarily, on the subject of the future
of the islands. The questions put to
all are: ; ; .-,
"Do you believe the Filipinos are cap
able of eelf-government In the town
ships?" _
"Do you believe the Filipinos are cap
able of self-government in the prov
inces?" -
"Do you believe the Filipinos are cap
able of self-government in the archipel
ago?"
All those who have been interrogated,
including Filipinos who sympathize
theoretically with independence, have
replied to the third question with re
markable unanimity, in the negative.
Independence, they say, would result
in chaos, endless tribal wars and Eu
ropean intervention. A few of . them
think that provincial self-government
is practical, but most of them favor
self-government in the townships with
a form of American supervision pro
tecting the inhabitants against the
peculations and extortions which their
experience with the Spanish regime has
led to consider the natural requisites of
officialdom.
The commercial classes urge the
sending of detachments -.of American
troops, each numbering about 100 men,
to take, possession of the towns in the
southern provinces and in the Viscaya
Islands, now held by small bands of
Tagallos. They declare the natives find
the Tagallo oppression worse than
Spanish oppression, and they will wel
come the Americans. The case of the
inhabitants of Gubat, in the province
of Sorsogon, Is cited as a typical in
stance. The Spanish taxes amounted
to $18,000., but the rebel Tagallos extort
$112,000 from the people of Gubat.
Agulnaldo's brother-in-law, the pro
vincial Governor, is said to be despoil
ing the people unmercifully. ; â  - ;
General Luna, who retired from the
command of the Filipino forces and
who was editing a newspaper at San
Francisco del Monte, his retirement
being due to the fact that Fuchinos re
belled at his rigid discipline, has been
recalled to the command. This is taken
as showing that the rebel army is only
kept together by harsh measures.
AGUINALDO SEEKS TO
PROLONG THE STRUGGLE
NEW YORK. April 12â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: It Is
becoming evident to officials of the ad
ministration that the insurrection in
the Philippines is apt to drag along for
a considerable time.
Dispatches received from General
Otis show that the natives retreat when
attacked by the American troops in
force, and the continuance of these
tactics show that Aguinaldo is deter
mined not to give the Americans an
opportunity of crushing his army at
one blow, as is so greatly desired by the
administration.
There is a disposition on the part of
some officers to believe that the at
tack made by the insurgents on General
Wheaton's command was to draw Gen
eral Lawton from the vicinity of Santa
Cruz, where he is operating. It Is ap
parent, however, that they found the
Americans in stronger force than was
expected.
Officials are becoming convinced that
Aguinaldo proposes to maintain a
\ guerrilla warfare which will keen the
: island of Luzon in constant turmoil
, and necessitate the maintenance of a
strong American army there, and the
i approach of the rainy season, now only
j a few weeks distant, will greatly em
barrass the American operations and
will, of course, benefit the insurgent
forces. ,

FILIPINO TIN THUNDER
OF THE HONGKONG JUNTA
HONGKONG, April 12.â The Filipino
Junta here regards the proclamation of
the United States Philippine Commis
sion as being objectionable and has is
sued a "grandiloquent statement to the
effect that it is a "tissue of generali
ties, bristles with Pharisaism and cant,
vaguely promises much and grants
nothing to the Filipinos, who are tired
of promises and surfeited by Spanish
promises similar to the American."
Continuing, the statement reads:
The proclamation proves that the fair
promises of Independence under a pro
tectorate and President McKlnley's dec
laration of the objects of the Spanish
war were only a mask of humanitarian
ism to cover the real intention. The invi
tation of the United States Philippine
Commissioners to' the Filipinos to get
them for an exchange of views is mean
ingless, as during the hostilities the rep
resentative Filipinos are necessarily ab
sent from Manila assisting in the strug
gle for Independence.
The Filipinos continue to resist a -vio
lent and aggressive usurpation, not be
cause they expect a complete victory,
but to emphasize their rights to protest
against a ruthless invasion. ' : â -â  â 
we emphatically deny that the aims of
the American Government have been mis
interpreted. The proclamation of General
Otis showed those aims clearly. We also
deny the legality â  of . the sale of sover
eignty over the Philippines by Spain, and
we reiterate positively that the Ameri
cans began the hostilities on February i.

DEMANDS RETURN
OF MINING BOOKS
REDDING, April ' 12.-An interesting
point, and one of wide significance, was
raised in this county to-day by the ap
plication of Waldo Elmore to County Re
corder l.nwden for the return to him of
the. district records of the Flat Creek
mining district. Up to the enactment of
the State mining law of 1897, requiring
district records to be delivered to County
Recorders, Elmore had been a District
Recorder for thirty years. Since. the re
peal of the State mining law he is per
haps the First District Recorder in the
State to apply to have his records re
stored to him. County Recorder Lnwden
referred the applicant to Judge Edward
Sweeny, who directed Elmore to apply to
the Board of Supervisors for a restoration
of the district records. It is doubtful if
the Supervisors order the records
transferred back to the original districts.
Work has been ordered stopped on the
Jackson group of copper claims in the
Backbone district, under bond to New
York capitalists, headed by J. F. Cole
man and represented here by William
Forstner. A debt of $3000 for development
work and supplies incurred by the bond
ers will have to be liquidated before the
owners of the property will permit work
to be resumed. The property consists of
fifteen claims and 400 acres of land.

BANDEEN FIRED
IN SELF-DEFENSE
Coroner's Jury Exoner
ates the Rancher.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, April 12.â A Coro
ner's jury to-night, sitting in the case
of H. H. Pearson, a farm employe
killed yesterday afternoon near Elk
Grove, brought in a verdict that the
deceased came to his death from pistol
shot wounds inflicted by John R. Ban
deen, and expressing the belief that
the shots were fired in self-defense.
After the verdict had been returned
District Attorney Baker authorized the
discharge of Bandeen from custody.
* Bandeen is one of the best-known
farmers in the county. After having
killed his farm hand yesterday after
noon he drove to the home of Under
Sheriff Reese, near* Florin, and sur
rendered himself. - He was driven into
Sacramento by that officer this morn
ing and placed nominally in the charge
of the Sheriff.
According to the story which Ban
deen tells, Pearson had been employed
on his place for five years. He was aii^
ill-tempered man when in liquor, an-JT
one day quarreled with Bandeen's son,
then an invalid, over possession of a
Sunday paper. Pearson went so far
on this occasion as to threaten' the life
of the son and even that of Bandeen
1 himself for his interference. The
; farmer discharged Pearson, but the lat-
I ter returned to the place when the
i Marty brothers leased it. Bandeen still
! retained an interest in the farm, and
S he was working on it yesterday when.
he encountered his former employe.
Bandeen's version of what transpired is
as follows: - 'â  â¢
"Yesterday afternoon at about s
o'clock I was plowing in the vineyard
and Pearson was driving a mowing
machine along the fence in an adjoin
ing field. I had but recently been mak
ing some repairs to the fence, which di
vided the two pieces of land, and had
left some barbed wire near the fence in
I the field in which Pearson was mowing.
1 Pearson drove into this and became
i angry. He left the mowing machine
i standing, and, climbing the fence,
; came over to where I was plowing and
i began to abuse me. I said to him, 'I
Ido not want trouble with you; you go
j your way and I will go mine.' He then
' left and walked around the house.
"I continued plowing and had made
I one round when I came close to the
j â house. . There was a pile of kindling on
the other side of the house with an ax
i near it. When I came near the house
i Pearson rushed out at me with the ax .
I in his hand. I at once drew my revolve-^
' and when he was close to me I fired.
! He fell down, but I did not wait to pick
him up. Instead, I hitched up and
drove into Gait, where I got a doctor
and sent him out to the ranch. I then
drove into Florin and gave myself up
to Under Sheriff Reese."

SECOND VICTORY
Sensation in the Note
Case.
OLD AFFIDAVIT IS PRODUCED
DESCRIBES THE DEAL BETWEEN
THE BROTHERS.
Former Justice of the Peace Kirk
patrick Says William Murdock
Admitted Having- Exe
cuted the Note.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS. April 12.â When the Mur
dock note case was resumed this morn
ing Gawn Murdock, husband of the
plaintiff, was on the stand and his
cross-examination was continued by
General Barnes. He repeated much of
. his testimony of yesterday, giving
A dates and the sums of money given by
Samuel Murdock to William Murdock.
The witness told his story in a simple,
straightforward manner that carried
conviction.
The next witness was T. J. Kirk
patrick, a prominent farmer and a â¢
brother-in-law of the plaintiff, and it j
was during his examination that the j
lirst genuine surprise or sensation of :
the trial was sprung. Witness testified
that he was Justice of the Peace in
1877 and 1878 in the township in which
<:. W. Murdock and Samuel Murdock I
lived. Samuel Murdock, William Mur- j
dock and himself were very friendly. I
Wit- - was the advise:- of Samuel in j
the latter's lifetime. Two years after
the day of the signing of the note in
question Samuel called on the witness
and said he wanted him to act as
guardian of his grandchildren (the
children of plaintiff) and If anything
should happen to him (Samuel) before
the note came due he wanted witness
to see that the money went to his
grandchildren. In order that Kirk
patrick should be advised as to par
ticulars, Samuel Murdock wished to
make an affidavit, and did swear to the
following:
October 31, 1579. Ollmpo, Colusa County,
California. I, Samuel Murdock will make
. a true statement of the business transac
tions that have existed between myself and
Willi Murdock. both of Colusa County,
, State of California, Postofflce. Kanawa. I I
V began loaning money to said William I
in the year of IS6I or '62. 1 will
not say which, and did continue to loan
to the .said William Murdock my money
until 1877. The first he borrowed from me
was money that was left to me by mi
lather's estate and my brother William
Murdock, who had previously died in
Crizzly Bend, Butte County. I let him
have $4000 the first loan. I then loaned
him the money that I sold my wool and
sheep for from year to year and trusted
to William Murdock to keep the accounts
as I had no education. I think he kept
the books as correct as he could until the
last transaction, the settlement with
Gawn M ird ck. I loaned him $5000 in
April, 1576. and when I made my final set
tlement with Gawn Murdock I loaned Wil
liam Murdjock the $20,000 the sth of Sep
;"' . tcmber, 1877, which was about two years
â¢ atro. I have settled with William Mur
dock and have taken a note from him for
the amount due me, dated September 5,
1577. and made payable to Mary H. Mur
dock for the benefit of my two grand- >
sons. Edmond and Samuel Murdock, and
due twenty years from date,
(his)
SAMUEL X MURDOCK.
(mark)
Siate of California. County of Colusa.
On this the 31st day of October. 1879,
before me, T. J. Kirkpatrick, a Justice of
the Peace In and for Stony Creek Town
ship, Colusa County, personally appeared
Samuel Murdock, known to me to be the
person whose name is subscribed to the
within instrument, and he acknowledged
to me that he executed the same.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set
my hand and private seal, having no seal
of office, the day and year in this certifi
cate first above written.
T. J. KIRKPATRICK.
w Justice of the Peace.
This affidavit he showed to William
Murdock, two months after it was
made, and, the reasons for making it
having been explained, William Mur
dock said it was all right.
The introduction of this document,
which looks as "old as it purports to be,
created a sensation.
The witness also testified to having
been present at a conversation between
Samuel and William Murdock in 1878,
at which time William was trying to
induce Samuel to reduce the interest on
the note from 12 per cent to 10 per cent
per annum.

Mogan.
It was afterward learned that at the
outset the jury stood eight to four for
acquittal and later ten to two. Contrary
to his practice Judge Mogan held court
last night for the purpose of disposing of
the case. At the outset the court over
ruled Attorney Ach's objection to the ad-
Ti.ission of testimony on the ground that
the complaint was defective and that the
ordinance had been violated.
Secretary F. H. Green of the Ingleside
track was the first witness introduced.
He testified that a horse named Truxillo
ran In the third race and that the animal
was owned by the defendant. Officer P.
A. Gillen followed and testified that he
was detailed by Captain Wittman to stand
in front of the Stuyvesant Club pool box
and while there a man named Sandusky
pushed his way through the crowd and
handed a. gold piece to Jones and said
Truxillo to win." According to the of
ficer s statement Jones handed Sandusky
a pool ticket and both were immediately
placed under arrest. Officer Burns cor
roborated Gillen.
Prosecuting Attorney Joachimsen then
addressed the jury on the merits of the
case and Mr. Ach followed with a lengthy
.argument In which he asserted that there
was no proof that his client had violated
th. ordinance.

ALL RULINGS FAVOR
GOVERNOR SADLER
CARSON, Nev., April 12.â Su
preme Court to-day rendered a decision
in the case of McMillan vs. Sadler in
the gubernatorial contest. McMillan's
demurrer to Sadler's answer, on the
ground that it "did not state facts suf
ficient to constitute a defense," is over
ruled. The second demurrer, on the
ground that the answer "was not a
sufficient denial of the allegations of
said information," is overruled. THe de
murrer to subdivisions of the an
swer, 9 to 29, inclusive, upon the
grounds named in the third specifica
tion of the demurrer, is overruled. This
I related to Sadler's allegations having
I been made on information and belief.
'< The demurrer to subdivision 23 of the
answer, specification 4 of the demurrer,
lis overruled for the present. This re
lates to the Reno vote, and the legality
of that vote will be passed upon on a
further trial of the case. The demurrer
to defendant's allegation regarding the
legality of the Storey County vote is
sustained in part. This relates to Con
, boles' name. The demurrer to the de
fendant's answer relating to illegal
I registration of 300 names in Reno by
j persons other than the registry agents

At 7 o'clock Rollins' orchestra struck up

SPANISH PARTY
FORMED IN CORA
Headed by the Marquis
de Arguelles.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, April 12. Marquis de Re
bell announces the formation of a
Spanish party in Cuba under the hon
orary presidency of Marquis de Ar
guelles, the richest man on the island;
I and the probable future representative
lof Spain here, although not yet offi
\ cially accredited. About thirty promi
i nent Spaniards, in and out of Havana,
were called into conference. The an
nexation of Cuba to the United States
is the unanimous desire of these gen
tlemen, although no reference is made
to this in their general address to th_e
Spaniards in Cuba, as they regard it
inexpedient to agitate the question just
now and thereby cause still greater po
litical unrest.
The address of the new party, which
is signed by Marquis de Rebell, is en
tirely devoid of political references and
simply announces the fact of organiza
tion and the election of officers, all of
whom are men of prominence.
It asserts, however, as the controlling
feature of the party's programme, a de
sire to promote the peace and prosper
ity of Cuba, to which the members of
the party are "bound by the most sa
cred ties," and it earnestly advises all
Spaniards here to act nobly together
in upholding the honor, dignity and
traditions of Spain.
ARBITRATORS NOT YET
NEAR A SETTLEMENT
Value of the Los Angeles Water
Plant Has Not Come Up
For Consideration.
LOS ANGELES, April 12.â The board
of arbitrators that has In hand the
mass of evidence submitted by the city
of Los Angeles and the water company
is deep in the perplexities of the situa
tion. The question of determining the
value of the water plant has not come
up for settlement. James C. Kays, who
is the city's arbitrator, said to-day this
phase would be reached in a few days,
and a decision upon the value of the
plant would follow within a short time.
The opinion of the few who have fol
lowed the negotiations is that no such
agreement as Kays hopes for will be
reached. This view is based upon the
alleged fact that Captain Healy, the
water company's member of the board,
was made a member for the express
purpose of compelling an agreement
satisfactory to the water company or
preventing arbitration entirely.
Whether an agreement by Colonel
Mendell and Kays as against Captain
Healy would be binding upon the
water company is a point upon which
lawyers differ. Such a result would
mean another lawsuit, to be taken
through all the courts of the State.
What the arbitration will cost the
city cannot be figured out. Kays was
appointed as the city's arbitrator on
July 27 last. The prediction was then
made that the pending proceedings
would end in sixty days. Kays is paid
$25 every day he is actually employed.
His bill has never been presented to
the city. At full rates ever since his
appointment the city would~be in debt
to Kays not far from $4500.
The lawyers have nearly given up
hope of ever receiving a decision from
the Supreme Court in the headworks
case. The issue has been with the
court for nearly eighteen months. It
was resubmitted in November last. A
decision in February was then prom
ised. Jt is now said the result may be
looked for next week, when the court
will be in session in Los Angeles.
Colonel Mendell . of San Francisco
gives it as his opinion that an agree
ment will be reached within two weeks.

PORTER MAY TAKE
ALGER'S POSITION
In That Event Wtytelaw Reid
Would Become Embassador
to praoce.
NEW YORK, April 12.â The Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: It is confidently expected by several members of the
administration that the President, as soon as he succeeds in forcing the
retirement of Secretary Alger, will appoint Embassador Porter to the
head of the War Department and Whitelaw Reid to the Paris mission.
The President's strongest political advisers continue to insist upon
Secretary Alger's dismissal from the Cabinet if he will not go voluntar
ily, and the President, it is believed, will not hold out against this pres
sure much longer. It is known the President would like to have a New
York man at the head of the War Department, and that he considers
Mr. Porter admirably equipped for the reorganization of the army and
for wiping out the plague of Algerism which infests the War Depart
ment. It is also known that he is anxious to provide an important for
eign mission for Mr. Reid.
Senator Piatt is so anxious, for party reasons, to have Mr. Alger un
saddled from the administration before the next campaign that he
would, it is now believed, waive all opposition to Mr. Reid.
REFUSES TO PROSECUTE
JAMES P. TREADWELL
Because of Her Sudden Change of
Heart Georgie Woods Is Ar
rested for Vagrancy.
SAN JOSE, April 12.â There was a sen
sational turn to the damage, criminal and
misdemeanor suits against James P.
Treadwell, the young capitalist, this morn
ing and all three will be dismissed.
Georgie Dunn, alias Georgie Woods, who
figured as plaintiff in the litigation, re
fuses to prosecute, and because of this she
was arrested on a charge of vagrancy and
made defendant in a suit for $1200 attorney
fees alleged to be due for services in her
$25,000 damage suit against Treadwell.
Later in the day she charged Treadwell
with battery on her on February 13 and
he pleaded guilty and paid $100 fine as an
alternative to serving 100 days in jail. The
Dunn woman has also given him a satis
faction in full for the $25,000 damages de
manded for a beating he gave her and has
signified her intention to have the charge
of Intent to murder against Treadwell dis
missed. These two young people are now
participants in a love feast and left the
city together this afternoon, and It is
said their ultimate destination is beyond
the limits of the State. It is said Tread
well has given her a few hundred dollars
and promised her an extended pleasure
tour along the coast.
This compromise rankled Attorneys
Herrlngton and O'Neil. and as they saw
their contingent fee of one-third of the
$25,000 demanded as damages disappearing
they resolved to take heroic measures. At
3 o'clock this morning they awakened a
deputy county clerk and filed a suit in
the name of George Sheddy against Geor
gie Dunn to recover $1200 alleged to be due
as attorney fees. A warrant was also ob
tained from Justice Jones at Mtlpitas
charging Georgie Dunn with vagrancy.
The woman was located in the Lamolle
House and the door of the room broken
in. She was arrested for vagrancy and
taken to the County Jail. At the same
time she was served with papers In the
suit for attorney fees. A garnishment was
served on the Safe Deposit Bank, where
it is said the woman has money and jew
elry amounting to $2000 deposited. She was
taken before Justice Rosenthal, after
spending several hours in jail, and re
leased on $20 ball on the charge of va
grancy, which had been sworn to by W.
A. Malley.

Connecticut Legislative Bill Stirs Up
a Commotion.
TOPEKA, Kans., April 12.â There is
pending before a committee of the
Connecticut Legislature a bill to pro
hibit banks of that State from Invest
ing in Kansas State bonds. Governor
Stanley, when apprised of this fact to
day, wired the committee that Kansas
would resist such discrimination. He
then sent for Superintendent of Insur

conference. They decided to adopt re
taliatory measures. Should Connecticut
pass such a law y Superintendent
Church threatens to prohibit all the

DECIDES TO LAY
A PACIFIC CARLE
Action Taken by Ottawa
Government.
ALL DETAILS AGREED UPON
LINE WILL TOUCH FIRST AT
FANNING ISLAND.
Starting at Vancouver, It Will
Branch Out in the South Seas
and Reach Australia and
New Zealand.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 12â
special dispatch from Ottawa, received
here to-night, states definitely that a
Pacific cable will be laid from this port
to Fanning Island, and thence on to
Australasia. This gigantic enterprise
was considered at a Government cau
cus to-day, when it was decided to
start work on it this summer. Follow
ing are the particulars as contained in
the dispatch:
The cable is to be ' laid from Van
couver to Fanning Island, a mid-ocean
station, and branch out thence to Nor
folk Island, one branch going to_Aus
tralia and the other to New Zealand.
The total distance is 8200 miles. The
longest stretch is from Vancouver to
Fanning Island. It will cost $7,500,000.
Another $1,000,000 will be required for
repair steamers. The maintenance of
the first year's contingencies revenue
is calculated on a basis of 2% per cent
interest and a sinking fund of $725,000.
The cost of construction is divided
thus: The Australasian colonies, eight
eighteenths; Great Britain and Canada,

wood Park grounds, near Long Branch,
N. J. Including post entries the list
was made up of 279 names and only
sixteen men failed to appear. Of the
266 men six were placed on the limit
mark, thirty-one yards, by the handi
cap committee and the others, including
three women, were placed on marks
down as low as twenty-five yards.
Of the six men who were put on the
limit mark only one, James A. R. El

killing nine straight. The other five
who failed to make a clean score were

BRUTALITY OF MEN
ON YUKON RIVER
Ignore the Appeals of an Old Man
Found Dying on the Ice
Trail.
" PORT TOWNSEND, April 12.â The
steamer Farallon arrived from Alaska
to-night bringing a large number of
passengers, some of whom were direct
from Dawson and Atlin. Among those
arriving from Dawson were the Miller
brothers, who left Dawson the latter
part of March. They say the ice Is
breaking so that travel up the river
is hazardous. They report the death
of an old man who was returning from
Dawson. He broke through the ice and
his feet were frozen. .. Parties coming
out were hailed for assistance, which
they refused to give, saying they had
no time to spare. The unfortunate man
was afterward found by the Canadian
police, but before medical aid could be
obtained he died. The police arrested
the out-coming men, but from lack of
evidence they were discharged.
Parties who were taking horses in
lost several animals by the breaking
of the ice between Lake Lebarge and
Lake Marsh. -
The Farallon brought down between
250 and 300 ounces of gold from Helen
Bay mines, about eighty miles south
of WrangeL '
five eighteenths each. Canada's re
sponsibility to be about $2,000,000.
On the foregoing basis the Govern
ment decided to enter upon the scheme
and it will, within two weeks, introduce
a measure in Parliament to authorize
its participation in the cost to that
proportion. The control of the cable
will be vested in the Governments in
terested, which will be represented on
the international commission of man
agement in the proportion of their sev
eral contributions. As the Australian
colonies and the Imperial Government
have tacitly agreed to undertake the
project on the terms which Canada has
decided to comply with, the construc
tion of the cable is thus practically as
sured, and work will be begun the
coming summer.
TORONTO, Ont., April 12.â A special
to the Globe from Ottawa says that
within a fortnight a bill will be intro
duced in ' the House of Commons to
provide for the/laying of a fable con
necting Canada with the Australian
colonies and providing for the Govern
ment supplying funds equivalent to
five-eighteenths of the cost of construe
tion as soon as Great Britain signifies
its readiness to provide a like sum and
the Australian colonies contribute
eight-eighteenths of the cost. This
action is already assured. The control
of the cable is to be vested in a com
mission to be appointed by the imperial
Government, each contributing colony
nominating representatives on the
commission in proportion to the amount
contributed. _____
BEEF INQUIRY IS
NEARING CONCLUSION
Generals Chaffee and Arnold Tell of
the Meat Supplied in the San
tiago Campaign.
WASHINGTON, April Generals
Adna R. Chaffee and A. R. Arnold, Dr.
Huidekopper and Captain Williams of the
Commissary Department were before the
court of inquiry to-day.
General Chaffee said that while he con
sidered the refrigerator beef supplied to
the army at Santiago wholesome the offi
cers and men of his command refused
generally to eat it. He attributed this
largely to the fact that most of them
were sick.
Dr. Huidekopper said the canned beef
was generally of poor quality.
Captain Williams told of the condemna
tion of the beef on board the transport
Panama.
General Arnold's testimony dealt with
the beef suplled at Jacksonville, which
was, he said, generally wholesome.
Members of the court express confidence
of being able to conclude the taking of
testimony by the early part of next week.
There will not be much delay after that in
the preparation of the report.

the delicate and important organs that are
the vestibule of human life and makes
them strong, healthy, vigorous, virile and
elastic. It fits for wifehood and mother-
hood. It banishes the annoyances of the
uncomfortable period preceding maternity
and makes baby's arrival in the world easy
and nearly painless. All the dangers of
maternity vanish under its beneficent in-
fluence. Its use during the period of an-
ticipation is a guarantee of the little stran-
ger's health and an ample supply of natural
nourishment. Thousands 01 women have
testified to its marvelous merits. All med-
icine stores sell it. Accept no substitute,

QUESTIONS OF TAXATION.
NOTWITHSTANDING tbe.unequaled commer
\ cial and-4. nancial prosperity of last year, if the
debit and the -credit items of the war with Spain
were finally adjusted its cost would aggregate a bil
lion dollars, a heavy load for the people to bear. ;
It is evident that there can be no immediate re
duction of the taxes paid to the Federal Government,
but that, on the contrary, new methods of increasing
revenue will have to be devised. The imposition of
stamp duties was originally adopted as a war meas
ure, and it was natural to resort to a temporary re
vival of the system when extraordinary demands for
money had to be promptly met.
But stamp taxes have never been regarded as part
of our permanent revenue system, and there is a
strong current if public opinion throughout the na
tion in favor of a scientific fiscal revision. Now that
peace has been declared there will be a vigorous de
mand* for some less cumbersome mode of meeting
our increased liabilities. ',
Questions of taxation should never be politically
considered nor enter into party strategy unless, as in
the case of duties upon* imports, they Involve prin
ciples upon which the people are divided. In order
i â¢â 'â â â â  ; -â â â â â -.
to bring our revenue system into harmony with pub
lic necessities and with the most advanced practical
ideas' a commission should be formed of thoroughly
able and competent men, to whom the problem should
be submitted and by whom it should be fully and im
partially considered, with reference to the delicate
and embarrassing complexities it includes.
Professor Henry C. Adams, the statistician of the
Interstate Commerce Commission, has contributed a
strong and clearly phrased paper to the discussion of
this important subject, in which he vigorously ad
vocates the Federal taxation of the earnings of rail
roads. He argues that the result of this method of
increasing the revenue would be the more systematic
and complete investigation of railroad business
through a central bureau, so that a simple basis of
assessment would be accurately ascertained that
could be adopted by the States as well as by the Federal
Government, and that in this way the complications
and discordances of the present methods of taxation
in different States might be simplified and reconciled
and uniformity, simplicity and certainty 'secured to an
extent that would be equally satisfactory to the rail
roads and the people.
There is much plausibility in the proposition that
in the case of railroads not the plant but the earnings
are the just basis of taxation. But there are many
objections to the. plan of Professor Adams, not the
least of which is the almost inevitable loss of revenue
to the States that would result from its adoption.
Taking the aggregate property of the country to rep
resent eighty billions of dollars and the aggregate
average expenditures of. Government, embracing all
its forrrÂ«, in times of peace, at one billion, the rate
of taxation i- one and a quarter per cent. But the
."mount annually paid by the railroad companies, as
shown by Professor Adams, approximates forty-three
millions, "which, estimated on the balance sheet as
sets, shows a rate of taxation of less than four mills."
Upon any calculation having the elements of probabil
ity this rate cannot be enlarged beyond six mills.
It is clear, therefore, that railroad .property, as
compared with other forms of wealth, is relieved
from fully half of its proportionate share of the fiscal
burdens. The necessity and the propriety, therefore,
of a revision that would aid in removing this inequal
ity is obvious. The revision, however, should- ex
tend to the entire Federal system, exclusive of cus
toms duties, and, if possible, should be so directed as
at least to tend toward greater uniformity in the State
methods of taxation. .
San Francisco .may be the field of conflict between
C. P. Huntington and the Vanderbilts. These gentle
men have met before in more than one gigantic bat
tle of wealth, but they may meet again when con
ditions are less to the liking of Huntington than they
were before;- -' -'

ONCE more The Call has demonstrated the superiority of its news service over that
of any or all of its competitors. It was the only paper in the world to publish
yesterday morning in its first edition the full and correct story of the affray in
the Samoan Islands in which two American and one British officer and four marines were
killed.
This is not the first time The Call has forestalled its competitors in giving news of
important events in Samoa. On January 18 of this year it was first to inform the world ,
that Chief Justice Chambers had decided the issue of the succession to old Malietoa in
favor of Malietoa Tanu,. and that Mataafa's. followers had broken out into active hostility
against the new chief. That news of an event which led up to the present crisis was pub
lished exclusively by The Call on the date named, not another paper in the world having
even a rumor of it.
The Call was enabled to give the news in advance of all other papers by reason of
the excellence of its widespread and well organized news service. Cable dispatches from.
Auckland are costly, but The Call, which has not a dollar to waste on. fakes or Creelmans,
spares no expense in 'legitimate news gathering, and thus furnishes the public with not
only the most reliable but the promptest reports of events in all parts of the world. ."
The difference between legitimate journalism and fake journalism was shown by
the contrast between the early and full report of the, news in The Call with the late and
jumbled reports given in extra editions of the Examiner. ; ; :
While the full report from Auckland was in every copy of The Call issued yester
day morning, so that every reader had the benefit of the news; the first edition of the Ex
aminer had nothing of the story whatever. Thus the v people in districts outside of the
city and many of those within it learned nothing of the Samoan news from that paper.
Later on, and after The Call with the full account was on . the streets, ~ the - Examiner,
issued a second edition, containing a jumbled report which was said to be based upon
I rumors in circulation at Washington City.
By that time The Call's news had gone East over the wires, and it was doubtless
a garbled summary of that report which furnished the basis for the Examiner's version.
It is worth noting that in giving the rumor from the East the Examiner did not pretend
to know the circumstances under which the officers were killed, but said: "If they were
on the American. cruiser at the time it would lead to the supposition that there had been
j some "conflict with another war vessel, but the desired information cannot at this moment
I be obtained."
At the time the Examiner was getting ready to assure its second edition readers
that information on the subject could not be obtained, the patrons of The Call were read
ing it at their breakfast table. It is true that later in the day the Examiner issued an
extra in time to give the news in advance of the evening papers which are now becom- 1
ing its rivals, but in order to obtain the extras the public had to pay. The Call had given !
the news not only with promptness,- but without "extra" charge to its readers.
SUPPRESSION NEEDED OLL GROUND.
IT is not improper to remark, apropos of the dis
turbance in the Police Department, that the peo
ple of San Francisco take a cheerful view of the
situation. Their aspirations are based upon the hope
that after Chief Lees and his lieutenants have suc
ceeded in suppressing themselves, they will proceed
seriously to the work of suppressing gambling, not
only in Chinatown, but in Caucasiantown. Gambling
cf all kinds is carried on in the latter region in de
fiance of law. Not many weeks ago we published a
list cf faro and crap games in operation. If this pub
lication attracted the attention of the Police Depart
ment no one has discovered the fact, aside from the
officers who were detailed to make the regulation
raids upon Caucasiantown, which never result in
anything except dust.
Doubtless there is need of a thorough investiga
tion in Chinatown. That region has long been a can
cer upon the face of the city, and the fact that it has
cost a large number of sergeants and lieutenants their
positions on the police force is attesting evidence that
as a corrupter of policemen it stands without a peer
in the records of the town. But. notwithstanding
hi-s. the Police' Commissioners should take nothing
for .granted. Lieutenant Price may have been giving
the Chinese gamblers protection in consideration of
concessions from them, but the charge should be
proved before he is either dismissed or removed. In
no event should the Commissioners make a change
in the administration of Chinatown without improv
ing its moral character. A mere shuffling of masters
will make no difference to the Chinese gamblers.
They would as soon pay tribute to Brown, Smith or
Robinson as to Price. What the Chinese quarter
wants is a lieutenant possessed of integrity who will
administer the law without fear or favor and entirely
irrespective of political pulls.
The history of "Chinatown squads" shows that
there is always at the bottom of corruption a politi
cian or two. Little Pete used to connect the gam
blers and highbinders directly with the political
bosses, and the "rake-offs" which he demanded were
paid in person to the "blind white devil," or other
white devils who were no^ blind, but who were able
to include in their contract not only police protection
in Chinatown, but protection in the Police Courts, if
not in the Superior Courts. In fact, Little Pete him
self was caught fixing a jury and sent to San Quen
tin.
However, we think we state the case succinctly
when we say that the people of San Francisco sin
cerely trust that the Police Department will suppress
gambling all around as soon as it has succeeded in
suppressing some of its conspicuous officers. Cer
tainly there is need of more suppression than the
Ingleside racetrack.
STREET-CAR OUTRAGES.
IT is not doubtful that on street car lines the pa
tience and the self-possession of conductors and
gripmen are severely taxed. But it is also true
that the traveling public have some rights that on a
few of the lines are habitually disregarded. ; -
There have been instances recently of brutal treat
ment of passengers by conductors that ought to at
tract the attention of the street railroad managers.
Only a day or two ago a sober and apparently re
spectable man riding on the dummy of a Powell street
car presented a transfer which the conductor declined
to recognize, and, upon his refusal to vacate his seat
or pay his fare, he was ejected, without unnecessary
violence. Down to this point it may well have - been
that the conductor was within his right. But when
this passenger, finding that his transfer would not be
accepted, again boarded the car and twice offered to
pay his fare, the conductor passionately told him
that he could not ride, and, with the help of another
employe of the line, again threw him off with such
violence that his head struck the lower end of a
lamp-post and was badly cut.
The latter half of this incident was purely brutal.
It happened on the same day that, on a Market
street car, a lady without silver tendered a quarter
eagle in payment of her fare, and, upon receiving her
change, objected to one of the silver dollars handed
her, on the ground that, in her opinion, it was coun
terfeit. Instead of replacing the dollar, as every in
stinct of propriety would have suggested, she was
at once publicly subjected to a torrent of abuse.
Impositions upon conductors unquestionably oc
cur, and they probably are often victimized by coun
terfeit silver. But nothing is commoner than for, a
passenger who has .tendered a quarter or a half dol
lar for fare, supposing it to be genuine, to have it re

ONE MORE ILLUSTRATION.
j turned by the conductor, after several minutes have
elapsed, and, unless quickly exchanged, to be insulted.
And these occurrences are more frequent with women
than with men.
Gripmen and conductors should be taught that, as
the representatives of common carriers, ordinary po
liteness and decent treatment arc not concessions on
their part, but merely the acknowledgment of rights
that passengers hold, and especially in American
communities.
ACCORDING to a publication of the United
States Bureau of Statistics; the submarine tele
graphs of the world at the close of last Febru
ary numbered 1500, had an aggregate length of 170,
--000 miles, represented a cost estimated at $250,000,000,
and transmitted annually about 6,000.000 messages.
The greater number of these submarine telegraphs
are comparatively short cables owned by govern
ments and employed in connection with forts, light
houses and signal stations. There are about 320 Com
mercial cables, owned by thirty-five companies. These
control about 150,000 miles of cable, leaving for the
governmental cables only about 20,000 miles of .the
total. It is noted, however, that the governments of
the world hold something more than 80,060 miles of
cable stock for war purposes ready at hand to be laid
at a moment notice when the emergency arises.
Every great body of water lying between any inhab
ited parts of the earth has been crossed and recrosscd
by submarine telegraphs. The Mediterranean is trav
ersed through its length and breadth by numerous
lines, the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea are
almost equally well supplied, and their islands arc con
nected with one another and with both the northern
and southern American continents; thirteen lines con
nect the United States with Europe; three span the
ocean between South America and the Old World;
the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean are traversed by
lines bringing Asia into communication with Europe;
while in the Pacific Ocean a scries of cables stretches
from Siberia southward to Australia and from that
continent other lines extend to New Zealand and to
New Caledonia.
The one link lacking to the completion of the world
system of submarine telegraph is that portion of the
Pacific extending from America across to Asia. Con
cerning that link the report says: "The chief obsta
cle in the past to the construction of a grand trans-
Pacific cable was found in the fact that midocean
resting places could not be satisfactorily obtained or
arranged for, no single government controlling a suf
ficient number of suitable landing places to make this
seem practicable in view of the belief that the distance
through which messages could be sent and cables con
trolled was limited."
The results of the war with Spain have put the
United States in a position to overcome the difficulty
cf the past. With landing places at Hawaii, Wake Is
land, Guam and the Philippines; we could lay a able
no section of which would have a length equal to that
now in daily operation between France and the United
States. The lengtht of the French cable from Brest to
Cape.Cod is 3250 miles, while the greatest distance
from land to land on the proposed Pacific route would
be the 2089 miles between San Francisco and Hawaii.
Along with the extension of ocean cables there has
been an extraordinary development and improvement
in the methods of their operation. On the first cable
across the Atlantic the speed rate was but three words
a minute, several hours were required for the trans
mission of a message and the receipt of a response,
and the cost to the sender was $100 a message. At
the present time the speed of transmission averages
fifty words, a minute, with a higher speed on the auto
matic transmitters; the price has been diminished to
25 cents per word, and it is noted that a message sent
from the House of Representatives in Washington to
the House of Parliament in London during the chess
match of 1898 was transmitted and a reply received
in 13^2 seconds. ly *''.;.
Summing up the benefits to be expected by the
United States from the construction of a trans-Pacific
cable, the report says: "The commerce of the coun
tries of Asia and Oceanica amounts to more than $2,
--000,000,000 annually, their imports alone averaging
more than $100,000,000 a month. Of this enormous
market the United States at present obtains less than
6 per cent. With direct cable communication across
the Pacific, direct water communication through the
Nicaragua Canal, and an increase in the number and
capacity of American steamships, it seems not im
proper to suppose a material addition might be made
to the share obtained by the United States in the trade
of that part of the world." ,-:.-,

A SON'S GRATITUDE.
TO the Editor of The Call: Permit me, through the columns of your
journal, to make public acknowledgment of my sincere gratitude and
heartfelt thanks to the people of San Francisco for their very
many courtesies, magnanimous and fraternal treatment of my hon
ored father â in life and in death and on the eve of my departure with
his remains for his loved home in Tennessee I beg to assure one and all
that a blessing is in my heart and a benediction on my lips for my
father's host of friends and acquaintances in this great city of the Pa
cific. In an especial manner do I desire to return my sincere thanks to
the three commanderies of Knights Templar for assuming entire charge
of the obsequies in this city and conducting them in the beautiful ritual
of "their order, which my father so much loved. To the , commanding
officer at the Presidio and of the National Guard for the escort of honer;
to the Hon. Samuel M. Shortridge for the words of eloquence; to the noble
women of the city who contributed the magnificent floral offerings, and
to the daily press for their kind words. The sadness attendant upon the
weary voyage across the Pacific finds here an amelioration which words
of mine can never express, and which I shall carry throughout life
among the choicest of memories. Very gratefully and respectfully,

the present time. The old business dis
trict seems to have caught the infection j
of the forthcoming boom. Buildings are
being overhauled; new ones are planned
or under way, while desirable property
is rapidly changing ownership. Last
week three separate sales were recorded,
each for over Â¥100,000. Warehouses and
- wholesale houses will be built on them to
, accommodate the increased trade with
the Orient.
The North End Improvement Associa
i tion is doing much for the section lying
east of Kearny street and north of Mar-
I ket. The chief demand of its members
! is for the betterment of the pavements.
'< There is a unanimous desire that the
i cobblestone pavement, which was a model
! in its way when originally put down forty
years ago, be replaced with bitumen or
, other modern material. The members of
i the association have asked the Supervis
i ors to bear half the cost of improving
the streets. The balance would be paid
by the property owners. They hold that
! the Supervisors owe a debt to the busi
ness interests, of the city In the matter
of these repairs. Property values and
rents have decreased enormously, all of
! which means a direct loss to the city in
; taxation. _ . _â â¢
President Charles Nelson of the Cham
ber of Commerce is one of the merchants
having an abiding faith in the future of
this city. "It Is evident the Government
will send all supplies to its possessions in
the far East from this city," he said yes
terday. "This will increase in volume
gradually and should In time reach enor
mous proportions. It is the shorter route
by this wav and will be the one used by
all exporters. The building of the Siberian
Railroad has had an appreciable
effect here. Already fifteen vessels have
left here for Vladivostok, where formerly
but three or four were required to handle
the material shipped from this port. Eng
land and Australia are using a great deal
of our redwood now. The English are
using it for furniture, having learned of
the beauty of the wood when polished. All
these signs point but one way. They indi
cate that this city will regain the pres
tige it enjoyed a quarter of a century
ago." _, Â .
J. H. Rosseter, manager for the house
of W. R. Grace & Co., shares with other
merchants the confidence in the future of
this port. "We are on the eve of a great
commercial awakening," he said. "The
trade from this port has been gradually :
increasing until it should soon assume !
large proportions. The merchants have
long watched the Orient as a great field
for their operations. All their hopes seem
destined to be realized now. Trade with
South America has developed gradually,
although this coast is under a disadvan
tage in handling it when compared with
the East. We transship at Panama, while
their steamers go direct." .â -â '-'-
According to Brainerd N. Rowley, editor
of California Fruit Grower, the fruit mi
i terests of the State are safe. He says
I "The outlook for good crops of fruit were
never better than they are at present. The
; fruit is fifteen days farther advanced than
lit was at this lime last year. The trees
are strong and hardy and there is little
possibility of their suffering a setback.
Cherries and apricots will not yield a full
crop, but all others will yield in abun
dance. It Is hard to tell what the foreign
I demand will be, as it is governed almost ,
I entirely by the price nt which the fruit
;is marketed. In this country, if the peo
ple want anything, they get it, giving no
' heed to the price. In other countries. If
they find an article costs more than they
I had set aside for it they go without or
; substitute something that can be had at
the price they intended to pay originally."
The infection of better times coming is
I in the air. and prosperity, which comes
i in the train of a largely increased volume
of trade, should soon be felt by the peo
! ple in all walks of life, whether they be
I in the ranks of the laborer or the mer-
I chant. ._

LAST HONORS
TO COL. SMITH
OF TENNESSEE
Just Tribute to the
Old Hero.
IMPRESSIVE MASONIC RITES
KNIGHTS TEMPLAR CONDUCT
THE FUNERAL SERVICES.
The Remains Escorted to the Ferry
by a Large Cortege of Police,
Military and Members of
â¢ the Order.
Grandly impressive were the honors
shown to the late Colonel William F.
Smith of Tennessee yesterdayâ nonors
such as are rarely shown the memory of
a fellow-soldier outside of his own home
circles. But though the widow and rela
tives of the veteran of two wars are
waiting for the home-coming of their
loved one, the breadth of the continent
away, it did not devolve upon mere stran
gers to perfunctorily perform the rites
due his rank in military and Masonic cir
cles. During his brief sojourn here last
summer, while en route to the Philip
pines, Colonel Smith made a host of
friendsâ new friends, to be sureâ but as
stanch and lasting as those he left be
hind in distant Tennessee.
It was with the expressed wish of these
new friends that the remains were held
here in order that San Francisco and the
State might honor them fittingly. ;'â 'â 
In his own State Colonel Smith was one
of the most prominent members* of the
Masonic order, and while here he was
welcomed into the local lodges, where he
formed many of .his warmest friendships.
It was proper, therefore, that the ser
vices should be conducted under the aus
pices of the Knights Templar, of with
deceased was past grand commander of
his native State.
The services were held in Masonic Tem
ple at i o'clock and it was significant of
the bonds that unite the North and South
that, among the large number of civilians
present .there were no more sincere
mourners than members of the Grand
Army and ladies of the Relief Corps, who
had learned to love this former officer in
the Confederate service.
Prominent in the temple were six com
rades of Colonel, then Captain Smith, of
the Army of Northern Virginia. They
were General H. R. D. Maclver of Stone
wall Jackson's staff and later a member
of the staff of J. E. B. Steuart, James E.
Tucker, Henry St. George Bryan, J. C.
Kane, J. S. Sherman and Thomas H. An
drews. In the escort to the ferry these
gentlemen were given a place in line im
mediately behind the members of the
Grand Commandery.
The heavy metallic casket, draped with
the American 'flag, stood in the center of
the floor and around and on top of it were
numerous beautiful floral pieces. Sir
Knight John F. Merrill presided, while
Rev. Alexander Carson officiated as pre
late. Sir Knight S. M. Shortridge deliv
ered the oration and Sir Knight Samuel
D. Mayer, grand organist and director of
the temple choir, arranged the musical
programme; which consisted of "One
Sweetly Solemn Thought," "Come to
Me," "Sleep, Brother, Sleep," and "Thy
Will Be Done," by the choir.
Besides the Grand Commandery there
were present California Commandery No.
1, Golden Gate No. 16 and Oakland No. 11,
all in full regalia, and these, together
with a large detachment of troops, acted
as escort.
The troops, drawn up on Post street in
front of the Temple, attracted an im
mense concourse of people, and for an
hour or more the street was almost im
passable. Sir Knight Frank V. Sumner
had charge of the escort, the troops be
ing commanded by Captain James E.
Britt, Twenty-fourth United States In
fantry. '
At 4 o'clock the services were concluded
and the casket was borne to the hearse,
the troops and Knights presenting arms
and the mounted band of the Fourth
United States Cavalry playing "Nearer
My God, to Thee." *
The pallbearers were Sir Knights
Franklin H. Day and Brilsford P. Flint
for California Commandery; Z. F. Gilpin
and A. W. Burrell for Oakland Com
mandery; Charles L. Field and A G
Booth for Golden Gate Commandery and
Majors H. B. Hosmer and James A
Margo of General Warfield's staff repre
senting the National Guard of California
Lieutenant Birdsall and a platoon of
thirty police headed the procession and
were followed by the band and Troops B
and M, Fourth United States Cavalry
.Troop A and the Second Brigade Signal
Corps, N. G. C. Behind the mounted j
troops marched Companies E and I
Twenty-fourth United States Infantry!
and it was a source of comment on the
changed conditions of the country that
colored troops marched in honor of one
who a third of a century ago fought to
continue their race in bondage. But these
dusky heroes of El Caney, Siboney and
Santiago were proud to pay this tribute
to the gallant old soldier who had now
fallen for the same flag they fought
under. Following the troops came the
three commanderies of Knights Templar,
the hearse followed by the dead officer's
charger he brought with him from Ten
nessee and left behind when he went to
Manila. The somber trappings, boots re
versed in the stirrups and sheathed sword
hanging from the pommel of the saddle
but added to the solemnity of the occa
sion. :-."â â '- --:-â .. r'i.> :.--^l:~:. '/--.,' :
The Â«Grand Commandery, Confederate
Veterans, and carriages containing Ser
geant George Smith, son of the dead offi
cer, who is accompanying the remains
home, and several lady friends of the
family brought up the rear.
Down Market street to Steuart, to Mis
sion, and thence to the eastern gate to
the depot marched the cortege, the mili
tary forming line and presenting arms at
the gate, while the Knights continued on
to the dock. A delegation went across
the bay to Oakland, where the casket was
placed on board the Central overland and
started east at 6 o'clock. Sergeant
Smith's mother and Bister will meet him
at St. Louis and with him will accompany
the remains of their husband and father
to Nashville.
A Fighting Artist.

CONSOLIDATION OF PRECINCTS
REGISTRAR BIGGY. WILL SAVE
EXPENSES.
His Present Clerical Force Will Be
Adequate to Perform the
Work Required of
Them.
Registrar Biggy has begun active prep
arations for the primary election to be
held in August, as well as for the pro
posed bond election to be held next
month. Yesterday the Election Commls- Â»
sioners held a meeting, those present be-^
ing Commissioners Wells, Lane, Tilton
and Sheehan. â¢.<.-,-â¦:
Aside from a general and informal dis
cussion of the new election laws and their
workings, the commission took favorable
action on the following request preferred
by Registrar Biggy: r,^ : "
April 11.- 1899.
To the Honorable the Board of .election
Commissionersâ Gentlemen: I respectfully ask
your honorable board to authorize me. to pre
pare for the holding of the primary election in
accordance with the act approved March S.
1.99, and known as the "Stratton Primary
Law." All elections under this law are to be
conducted, managed and controlled as are
elections for State and county officers.: The
general precincts as they now exist may be
consolidated, but not more than three- shall
constitute a primary election precinct. Regis
tration for this election will be open not-later
than June 3 and close July 22. The election will
be held on Tuesday, August 8, 1899. v.;*-
It will be necessary to map out the primary
election precincts, to prepare the necessary
blanks, tally lists, credentials and returns for
approval by your honorable board.
It will also be necessary to prepare for the
municipal election, which will take place in
November next, in accordance with the charter.
All election laws have been changed, with ref
erence to registration, and a new form of bal
lot and ballot law has been adopted.
Registration is now open, In view of the fact
that there may be an election for the ' issu
ance of bonds for local improvements.
I would therefore, in view of the foregoing,
ask your honorable board to be allowed the
necessary assistance as will from time to time
be required from now on for the proper conduct
of this office. Respectfully, ' â¢._ :â 'â 
W. J. BIGGY, Registrar of Voters.
All of the requests made by the Regis
trar were granted. Mr. Biggy stated that
he would be able to conduct registration .
for the bond, primary and municipal elec- -\
tions with his present clerical force and
without additional expense to the city.
New registration will not be necessary to
enable voters to participate in these elec
tions except where changes of residence
have occurred. . '('. ->:â â¢â¢-
For the primary election Registrar
Biggy will consolidate the 303 election pre
cincts into a total of 106, thus effecting a
considerable saving. If a bond election is
ordered the precincts will probably be
still further consolidated. -â¢'â -â â¢ j.--

MAJORITYâ J. D. H., City. If two
candidates run for an office, 120 votes are
cast, one receives 59 votes and the other

one has a majority of two votes over his
opponent, who received but 59.

A CLUBBING CAUSES INSANITY
BILL BOONAKA, A SAILOR ON
THE MAUNA ALA, BEATEN.
Sailing of the Nippon Maru for the
Orientâ A "Wharf Rat" Drowned
From Lombard-Street
Wharf.
The Toyo Risen Kaisha's steamer Nip
pon Maru sailed for the Orient yesterday
crowded with passengers and loaded to
tha guards with frieght. For Honolulu
she took away four batter! - of tl/e Sixth
Artillery. They will relieve the Second
Battery. U. S. V.. which has been sta
tioned In Hawaii almost since the an
nexation of the islands. The latter on
their return here will be mustered out of
the service. The batteries which sailed
on tne Nippon Maru are in command of
Major Samuel Miles.
Miss Ida M. Forsyth was also a pas
senger by the Nippon. Maru. On her ar
rival at Honolulu she will report to the
surgeon in charge ot the United States
Military Hospital for duty as active chief
nurse.
The Jeanette Waldorf Company also
went away on the steamer. They will till
an engagement at Honolulu and will then
proceed to Hongkong on the next China
steamer.
"Bill" Boonaka. a sailor on the Hawai
ian bark Mauna Ala, has gone crazy as
the result of a beating he received in the
"Scandinavian headquarters" on the cor
ner of Jackson and Montgomery avenue
last Tuesday morning. He was struck
over the head with a club and thrown
out on the sidewalk to shift for himself.
He was picked up in a semi-cons
condition and sent to the Harbor Receiv
ing Hospital in the patrol wagon. On his
arrival there Hr. yon der Leith sewed up
a lacerated wound over the eye and also
two wounds on the scalp. The sailor was
drunk, as well as being badly hurt, so he
was put to bed.
About noon Boonaka was considerably
better, and when he said be wanted to
leave the hospital no attempt was made
to detain him. He was not seen again
until Officer Mackey ran across him on
the front yesterday. He was then a rav
ing maniac and it took half a dozen po
licemen to handle him. At the Receiving
Hospital in the City Hall It was found
the clubbing received in the Scandinavian
headquarters had affected his brain. He
was placed in a strait jacket and sent
out to the City and County Hospital.
Boonaka is a Russian-Finn and lived at
Lane's sailor boarding house on Davis
street. Bane says he always was a quiet,
peaceable fellow, but he must have got in
with a tough crowd at the saloon.
One of the "wharf rats" is missing and
the harbor police are rounding up the
tribe to see which of them lost his life.
Early yesterday morning several of them
appeared on Bombard street wharf and
made a raid on some potatoes that were
stored there. As potatoes are retailing at
o cents a pound, a sack meant a good
haul to a wharf rut. One of them was
surprised in the act of lowering a sack
into a small skiff by Fred Raabe. When
the latter began to run down the wharf
the young fellow pot confused, and los
ing his balance fell into the bay. He
must have struck against the skiff, as
both he and the potatoes disappeared.
The wharf rat did not come up again and
a few bubbles were all that showed Raabe
where he had gone down. The rickety
skiff which he used in his midnight
prowls is still tied up to Lombard street
The Marine Firemen's Union is mak
ing another attempt to get rid of the
Chinese employed on the United States
transport Hancock (late Arizona). With
this enrl in view the union has interested
the (. alifornia delegation to Congress and
a hard fight Is to be made to get white
firemen work on United States vessels.
The association made the attempt some
Â« me ago. but failed, because at that time
Lncle Sam did not own the vessel. The
facts of the case have been wired to the
Secretary of War and it is hoped that
the Chinese will be replaced by white
men before the Hancock sails.
THE GRAIN CASES.
Judge Morrow Vacates Order Made
Last Tuesday Fixing Date for Com

E. S. Pilsbury of counsel for the South

United States circuit Judge Morrow yes
terday morning and asked thai ._ie order
pf court made on the day before should
be vacated, He raised the point that the
order was made in the absence of any rep
resentative of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and that therefore the due notice
contemplated by the law had not been
given to his side of he case. He said fur
ther that he and his clients were desirous
of bringing the grain cases to a speedy

The motion was contested by Attorney

A BUSY DAY AT PACIFIC-STREET WHARF.
THE work of getting the United States transport Hancock (late Arizona) ready for another voyage
to Manila is going ahead with a rush. The vessel came into port with the name Arizona on her bows
and on her stern, but these have been removed and the name Hancock substituted. She came in a
black-painted steamer, but will sail again as one of the white squadron. The British ship Strathdon is ly
ing alongside the Hancock coaling the latter vessel. â  On the south side of the wharf is the Australian mail
steamer Mariposa and astern of her is the island trader Mauna Ala. Into all these vessels freight is be
ing rushed, so Pacific-street wharf is as busy as a bee-hive from morning till night.
I they were entitled under the rule and
he therefore vacated the order made last
Tuesday and set May 4th as the date for
! hearing the application for the extension
! of time in which to complete the taking of
testimony before the Master in Chancery.

. THE SAN FRANCISCO 7 CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1899.
NEALL MIGHT
HAVE TURNED
IN THE CHECKS
Damaging Evidence
at His Trial.
INDORSEMENT NOT NEEDED
SLAVENS WOULD HAVE TAKEN
THEM AS THEY WERE.
First Bad Day for the OfficerâTesti
mony Relating to the Most
Serious Charge Against
Him.
Yesterday was not so good a day for
Lieutenant Neall as has been the others
of his trial. The first really damaging
testimony against him was given, and the
questions of the defense could not make
much out of it except the fact that it
might have been worse. And the most
serious part of it was that the testimony
was given upon and tends to prove the
gravest of the chargesâ conduct unbecom
ing an officer and a gentleman.
Lieutenant Harris, adjutant of the
Fourth Cavalry and of the post during
the time of Neall's trouble, continued on
the stand until near the hour of adjourn
ment. His examination related mostly to
the statement made to him by Neall that
it was necessary to obtain the indorse
ment of Mrs. Nolan to certain checks be
fore he could turn over the accounts of
the post exchange. In making this state
ment it was alleged that Neall willfully
deceived the adjutant, and the witness
would not recede from this view of the
matter.
The witness said he had no knowledge
of whether or not Neall knew of the ap
pointment of Mrs. Nolan as administra
trix of her husband's estate when he said
he had to await her action on the checks
made payable to her husband as officer
of the exchange. Neither had he any
knowledge whether or not Neall, knowing
Mrs. Nolan had been appointed, willfully
neglected to secure her indorsement. He
believed he had been deceived first be
cause Neall refused to turn over to his
successor the checks needing indorse
ment; second, because while the amount
under his control in money and property
made up a total of over $4900, the checks
he referred to did not amount to more
than $200 at the most; third, because ho
had been informed by the post com
mander that Neall had made the same
excuse to him, for his failure to turn over
the books. And during all this time his
successor had signified a willingness to
accept the checks as they were and se
cure the indorsement himself.
"Do you believe from the facts as you
see them that Lieutenant Neall intended
to deceive you?" asked Mr. Thornton.
"I do," was Harris' reply.
"Do you admit the explanation was
true in fact?"
"No, I do not."
"Do you admit it was partly true?"
"No, I do not."
"Do you admit it was true In any
sense?"
"1 do not believe It was a true excuse
for his neglect."
Harris then went on to say there was
no reason why Neall should not have paid
the difference between these checks and
the amount that should have been on
hand toward the dividends to the regi
mental fund and the band fund. Had he
known the. checks amounted to only $200
or less he would have made an investi
gation at once. As It was, he took what
Nf all told him as the truth. "I know now
it was not the truth," were the closing
words of the witness.
Thomas H. Slavens, first lieutenant,
Fourth Cavalry, quartermaster of the
post and of the regiment, commissary of
the post and of the regiment, officer of
the post exchange, police officer of the
post and fire marshal of the post, was
the next witness. He had succeeded to
the job vacated by Neall. He testified
that when the accounts of the commis
sary office were turned over to him they
were correct, but there was money owing
to the department. One of these bills
was from Neall himself. There was also
due the treasurer of the post his allot
ment of the receipts from the commis
sary store. There was also due the bill
of the post exchange to the commissary
department.
The witness .then told how he had taken
possession of the post exchange on Feb
ruary 16â the day after Neall's disappear
anceâand how he had found things in a
rather chaotic condition. There were out
standing bills amounting to over $3000 and
the account at the bank had been over
drawn about $150. He received from the
adjutant a bundle Of checksâ checks
which Neall told him had to be indorsed
by Mrs. Nolanâ and these he took to her
and had them Indorsed and afterward
deposited In the bank. They did not
amount to more than $200. It was some
time In February when Neall told him
he could not get the checks Indorsed. It
was in January Mrs. Nolan was appoint
ed administratrix of her husband's estate
and became capable of indorsing the
checks.
"The checks could have been turned
over to me without Indorsement," said
the witness, in answer to questions, "and
I could have secured the indorsement my
self, as I ultimately did."
The hour of adjournment cut off for the
time being questions on the financial af
fairs of the club.
The evidence relating to the indorse
ment of the checks is damaging, for upon
it is based three of the specifications in
the charge of conduct unbecoming an offi
cer and a gentleman.
LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER
MATERNAL OPPOSITION
MANUEL RIVAS AND INACIA
TURRES ARE MAN AND WIFE.
They Eloped, Pursued by Mrs. Turres,
but They Were Just Ten Min
utes Ahead of Her.
An Irate mother, accompanied by a male
friend, called at the Chief of Police's of
fice yesterday morning and wanted her
daughter and her lover arrested. She had
reason to believe they had eloped and
might possibly seek to get married, but
she desired the marriage prevented.
The mother was Mrs. Turns, 2T0% Bran
nan street, and she said her daughter was
too young to marry, as she was only 14
years of age last October. The young man
was Manuel Kivas, who was employed in
an office as shipping clerk.
Detective Anthony was detailed on the
case and he went to "Cupid" Danforth's
office, where he ascertained that a mar
riage license had been issued to Manuel
Rlvas, 20 years of age, and Inacia Turres,
18 years of age. He was told that Kivas
and the girl had sworn that she was of
age, and as she is a well developed young
girl there was no suspicion that she was
younger.
The detective learned that the couple
seemed to be in a hurry to get married,
and he called upon different Justices of
the Peace, and Justice Cook informed
him that he had performed the ceremony
about ten minutes previous and the young
couple had hurried away.
Mrs. Torres was waiting in the Chief's
offlce and was furious when Anthony ap
prised' her of the result of his investiga
tion. She announced her determination to
get even with Rlvas and will annul the
marriage if possible. To-day, unless wiser
counsels prevail,, she will swear out a
warrant for the arrest of Rlvas on the
charge of perjury for swearing that her
daughter was IS years of age when she is
only a few months past 14.

POROUS PJSASSISIi!^
Perhaps you sometimes use a porous

And do you know which the best one is?
The one whose reputation covers 40

wonderful popularity gave birth to the
scores of imitations. And which is this?
Why, Allcoclcs â plaster they all try

A CHINESE MAN AND AN
I NDIAN MAIDEN TO MARRY.
A CHINESE man and an Indian maiden are the latest novelty in the
field of matrimony. They visited Cupid Danforth at the City Hall yes
terday and procured a license permitting them to wed. Miss Neevis
Paderas is the happy bride-to-be, and she is as comely a young wo
man as one could meet in a day's journey. She Is just 18 years old and
very much in love with Lee Moy, her intended husband. Lee Moy is a
young Chinese, sleek, prosperous and extremely" proud of his ability to speak
English like a native. Long ago he decided to make. America his perma
nent home, so he cut off his queue, doffed the costume of his own country,
forswore lottery, fan tan and the opium pipe and became as good an Ameri
can citizen as it Is possible for him to be. Feeling that it was not good for
man to be alone, he looked about him for a.'wife, and found his affinity in
comely Neevis Paderas. To her he paid court, escorted her to and from
church in the Mission district, confessed his love and was accepted.
Both Mr. Moy and Miss Paderas have a good common school education
and both are members of the Methodist church. They applied to Clerk Dan
forth last week for a license, but that official was not sure that he was per
mitted by law to issue a license in such a case, so they were told to come
again yesterday. In the meantime it was found that the law which pro
hibits the intermarriage of individuals of the Caucasian race with Chinese,
negroes or Indians was silent as to marriages between Chinese and Indians.
So it was that when the young couple arrived at the City Hall they were
given a license. They declared their intention of being married by a Meth
odist minister.
DRUGGIST GATES WAS
ASPHYXIATED IN BED
FOUND DEAD IN A ROOM AT THE
LICK.
Was Engaged to Be Married to Miss
Ida Kleinhaus and Had Been in
Her Company the Even
ing Before.
A. L. Gates, druggist at the Folsom
Penitentiary, was asphyxiated in room
153 of the Lick House some time last Tues
day night, and his dead body was found
by a bellboy at 7 o'clock yesterday morn
ing. Deputy Coroner McCormick removed
the body to an undertaking establishment
and made an inquiry into the cause of
death. He reported that there was no
doubt that the death was accidental. Be
yond the fact that the bellboy had found
Gates dead with the stopcock of the gas
jet turned on Mr. McCormick seemed to
know nothing. The hotel clerk had an
equally ample fund of information. He
said that Gates registered at the hotel last
Tuesday night ana that he had been found
dead in the morning. The Keyhole and
other crevices in the room had not been
stopped up, and this fact was considered
as evidence that the case was not one of
suicide. _ , __ .
An hour after the discovery of the body
Miss Ida Kleinhaus of 640 Fell street
called at the hotel and inquired for Gates.
When Informed that he was dead she
burst into tears and was inconsolable. She
said that Gates had made an appointment
to meet her at S o'clock. She went away
and returned shortly afterward to the ho
tel with her brother. He stated to Dep
uty Coroner McCormick that his sister
and Mr. Gates had been keeping company
for several months and were to have been
married in a few weeks. He saw Gates
on the previous evening on his return
home from the theater sitting in the par
lor of the Kleinhaus residence with Miss
Kleinhaus. He retired after greeting the
visitor and was informed by his sister
yesterday that Gates left about midnight.
Gates left word with the night clerk at
the hotel to be called at 7 o'clock in the
morning, adding that he expected a
friend to meet him at 8 o'clock.
The denial of the hotel clerk that the
key of the gas fixtures was loose deepens
the mystery. The most rational supposi
tion is that the deceased when he turned
off the gas carelessly turned the key
partly on again.
Young Gates was 28 years old and had
been for several years employed in the
prison as -druggist. He came down from
Folsom last Tuesday.

Chris Myrtle, an Ex-Convict, Arrest
ed on a Charge of Burglary.
Chris Myrtle, ex-convict and member of
a notorious family, was arrested early
yesterday morning and booked at the City
Prison on a charge of burglary. He was
caught in the room of F. A. Dunbar, 1346
Market street, just as he was about to
leave with a bundle of clothes he had
gathered together.
Myrtle while serving a term for burg
lary in San Quentin was the leader of a
gang -that made a break for liberty sev
eral years ago. His father and mother
were arrested some years ago for mur
der in Spanishtown. After the jury
brought in a verdict of guilty against the
woman her husband confessed that he
was the murderer, but he was not be
lieved, and she was sent to San Quentin.
Dan. one of the sons, was shot and killed
at Twelfth and Harrison streets, and Joe,
another son, has only recently served six
months for failure to provide.
Death of William Friel.

dence was at 32 Tehama street, died yes
terday morning from injuries received a
few days ago by the fall of a coal buck
et upon him In the hold of a ship In
which he was working. The case has
been reported to the Coroner.
Unknown Drowned Man.
The body of an unknown man was found
yesterday floating in the bay near the foot
of Washington street wharf. The body
had not been more than a day in the wa
ter. The deceased was about 50 years old.

and no vest, negligee shirt of black with

A Chinese Capper.
Chung Gom was ordered into custody
by Judge Graham yesterday on a charge
of vagrancy. He had been observed
hanging around the court for several
days and talking to Chinese prisoners in
the dock. Yesterday Ah Sun was in the
dock on a charge of selling lottery tick
ets and when the Judge observed Chung
Gom talking to him he ordered Sergeant
Duncan to arrest him. Ah Sun was fined
$50 or fifty days.
An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beueficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Syrui- of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting-
them in the form most refreshing- to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing- the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company

DR. RIMER'S REMEDIES.
PARSNIP COMPLEXION.
A majority of the ills afflicting people
to-day can be traced to kidney trouble.
It pervades all classef of society, in all
climates, regardless of age, sex or con-
dition.
The sallow, colorless-looking people
you often meet are afflicted with "kid-
ney complexion." Their kidneys are
turning to a parsnip color, so is their
complexion. They may suffer from in-
digestion, bloating, sleeplessness, uric
acid, gravel, dropsy, rheumatism, ca-
tarrh of the bladder, or irregular heart.
You may depend upon it, the cause Is
weak, unhealthy kidneys.
Women as well as men are made
miserable with kidney and bladder
trouble and both need the same remedy.
Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root, the great
kidney, liver and bladder remedy, will
build up and strengthen weak and un-
healthy kidneys, purify the diseased,
kidney-poisoned blood, clear the com-
plexion and soon help the sufferer to
better health.
The mild and the extraordinary effect
lof Swamp-Root is soon realized. It
stands the highest for its wonderful
cures of the most distressing cases,
such as weak kidneys, catarrh of the
bladder, gravel, rheumatism and
Bright's Disease, which is the worst
form of kidney trouble. It is sold by
druggists, in fifty-cent and dollar sizes.
You may have a sample bottle by mail
free, also pamphlet telling all about it.

MANUFACTURERS AND
PRODUCERS FEAST
Almost Two Hundred Sat Down to the Annual
Banquet at the Merchants' Club.
The Welfare of San Francisco and California Was the
Keynote of the Sentiment Expressed in
Response to the Toasts,
THE members of the Manufacturers'
and Producers' Association and their
guests, men prominent in the com
mercial and professional life of the
city, sat down last night l-> the annual
banquet in the large dining room of the
Merchants' Club, on the eighth lloor of
the Mutual Life building. Nearly 200
gentlemen extended their limbs under the
table to discuss a menu that fully war
ranted the close attention they bestowed
and fully prepared them for the oratorical
feast that came after the cigars were
lighted.
At the head of the long center table sat
A. Sbarboro, the newly elected president
of the association, who acted as toast
master. On his right sat Mayor Phelan
und on his left C. P. Huntington, each of
whom made responses during the evening
that elicited the greatest merriment. The
keynote to the sentiment of the evening
was "The Welfare of San Francisco," and
to pave the way for those who were to
follow him and point out the means to
be used to attain that end James W.
Kerr, the retiring president, was culled
upon to respond to the toast, "The Work
of the Manufacturers' and Producers' As
sociation. He said, in part:
"In the light of recent events the future
of the Pacific Coast and more particularly
San Francisco has been the subject of
much thought and much discussion. We
have had ideas advanced and exchanged
on this all-absorbing topic. This city 'Â«
bound to grow to be one of the largest
centers in the world. 1 am not mv of
an advocate of the idea of sitting down
and seeing things grow. 1 believe oppor
tunities are present here and that great
developments will take place in the near
future, which will enable us by energetic
work to make San Francisco all you ex
pert and would like it to be. But you
must build, not wait.
"The merchant and manufacturer must
join hands to build up the industries of
the State of California. They must see
to it that this city of San Francisco be no
longer a way station between the manu
facturers of the East and the markets of
the Orient. They must .see. to it that this
city must become a base of supplies. To
place San Franlcsco in !hi. independent
position Is the object of the Manufactur
ers' and Producers' Association, and that
Is the aim and the end of the home indus
try movement in which you are all re
spectfully invited to co-operate."
The health of President McKinley, re
ferred i" by th- toastmaster as the great
est man on earth, was drunk standing.
Congressman-elect Julius Kahn being
called upon to respond. He did so in a
speech that was loudly and frequently
applauded.
"When we speak of our President." he
said, "we can say that when he assumed
the helm of state he found our manufac
turers and producers looking for markets
in vain; he found, indeed, 'sloth in the
mart'; he found the factories closed and
Coxey armies tramping throughout the
land. in two years what do we see? He
has recreated conditions and to-day our
workingmc-n are getting increased wages
and we see in the newspapers reports of
this factory and that factory raising the
hire of Its employes and the balance of
trade in favor of our country during this
last year of six hundred and eighty mil
lions of dollars. Why, gentlemen, if that
condition were continued for another ten
years this Government of ours, this people
of ours, this nation that we all love, will
be the creditor nation of the world. I am
satisfied that even his political opponents
will admit that William McKinley was
the right man at the right time."
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford, who
said he was not a producer in the or
dinary acceptation of the word, respond
ed to the toast, "The State of California."
"Never before," he said, "has the State
been so signally favored as now since
the days of '49. The eyes of the world
are turned to the Golden West and, as
had been suggested by Mr. Kerr, the
State is upon the threshold of a new era.
Logical events had placed California in
the very' forefront, and with all eyes
turned to the Orient California's hand is

on the nation's gateway ready to wel
come the commerce of the Far East."
In introducing Mayor Phelan to respond
to the toast. "San Francisco," Mr. Sbar- j
boro painted a dream of the city's future
greatness, which included free salt water
baths in every household. The Mayor,
after avowing that his thunder had been
appropriated, continued:
"The chairman has announced the mv- |
nicipal programme. He forgot but one
thing. In addition to the salt water baths
we are going to have an ordinance pro
viding for compulsory bathing. He re
minds me of another time when a dis
tinguished gentleman. Sir Thomas More, j
made such a municipal programme and I
published his researches under the title I
of 'Utopia.' You will recall his fate. He j
was beheaded."
The remainder of the Mayor's remarks j
were devoted to the grand opportunity i
within the grasp of this city and State !
given by the acquisition of the Philippines j
and he took occasion to say that as a
San Franciscan he felt that the views of j
Thomas Jefferson concerning the acquisi
tion of outlying territory were not fitted i
for these times.
Senator Perkins responded to the toast.
"Our Country." and during the course of â 
his remarks he took occasion to say that \
he, too. could see the great future before j
this city and State and the manufactur
ers and producers. He gloried In the j
achievements of the Oregon and other j
warships turned out on this coast, and i
then he paid a tribute to C. P. Hunting
ton. In it he said that the Southern Pa- I
cific magnate had done more for the State I
than any other six men in it.
The toastmaster called upon Mr. Hunt- |
ington to say something about railroads, I
and the aged railroader acquiesced.'
"I am not one of the scholarly men of
the country. I am not In literature, or
high art. I have been sawing wood for
seventy years. I feel myself honored In
being here to-night. I don't know as I
could say anything except that Mr. Per
kins, my friend, has said something in
favor of myself, for the very first time, I
believe. As he says, you people In San
Francisco have done great things. You !
ran an opposition steamer line to Panama
at the cost of a few hundred thousand
dollars and made millions. You should do
it some more. There are many things for
Californians to. do, and the little things
are the ones to do. I am always doing
something.
"I am not afraid that the star-spangled
banner will be torn down by any nation. â 
The great American system will stand. We
have gone to Manila. I'm glad we have.
And we have a position In the world we
must maintain. Some said we should nit
have gone to the tropics, but we did go
there, and if we can go on raising those
people up we will be doing a good thing."
William Sproule. freight traffic manager
of the Southern Pacific Company, spoke
of the "Railroad's Relations to Com
merce," and achieved the distinction of j
having made the speech of the evening. I
The relations of the railroads with com- i
merce, he said, were satisfactory, not- I
withstanding the fact that one might be
induced by reading the papers that run
down everything to think otherwise. The
railroads, he continued, seemed to him to
be the poor relations of commerce. He \
told some pertinent stories to illustrate \
his remarks and brought forth much j
laughter.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 13,* 1899.
BADGE FOR SHERIFF MARTIN
Popular Official Honored by His Associates
at a Banquet.
SHERIFF HENRY S. MARTIN was presented with a handsome diamond
badge last evening by the deputies in his office. The presentation took
place at an elaborate banquet given at Pabst Cafe, at which fifty
guests assembled. The badge is a beautiful speciment of the jeweler's
art and was made by Alfred Liebert, a personal friend of Mr. Martin. On
the face is a laurel wreath in green gold, which surrounds a Bis-pointed
star, with a three-karat diamond in the center. The whole is surmounted by
an eagle In etruscan gold, with a smaller diamond for the eye. On a plain
circle of gold "Sheriff, San Francisco." is enameled in blue. On the reverse
side of the badge Is the following Inscription: "Presented to Henry S. Mar
tin as a token of esteem and respect by his associates."
Sheriff's Attorney Edgar D. Peixotto made the presentation speech in a
complimentary vein, and Mr. Martin responded briefly, though feelingly. As
he aptly put it, "The Sheriff is a man of few words, but of much execu
tion."
Toastmaster Peixotto called on ex-Sheriff Richard Whelan, who spoke
on "How the Sheriff's Office Should Be Run," and recounted some amusing
incidents which occurred when he transferred the jails Over to his successor
last January.
Under Sheriff David C. Martin, to whom the credit for the successful
outcome of the affair was largely due, told of the "Duty of the Subordi
nate." Toasts were also responded to by Recorder Albert C. Berthier, Jules
S. Godeau and others. ' "__V;",

The next session of the Grand Council
will be held in San Francisco in 1901.
It was resolved that a premium of 12 be
paid to a member who brings in a candi
date, but not until after he shall have
paid two assessments. â¢ ,
It was decided to appropriate $300 to help
defray the expenses of the approaching
twentieth anniversary of the order.
A vote of thanks was tendered to the
Progressive Councils for its reception on
Tuesday night, and one to the press and
particularly to The Call for its courtesy
to the order in reports of its proceedings.
A vote of thanks was also extended to
the retiring grand councilor for his ear
nest work in behalf of the order during
his term of office.
A very peculiar case occupied the at
tention of the Grand Council for some time.
A member of Rainbow Council of Marys
ville. Margaret Carr, made her son her
beneflciarv in the sum of $3000. The son
died suddenly, and three days later, be
fore Mrs. Carr had an opportunity to
change her beneficiary, she died. The widow
of the son claimed the money, and so did
two sisters of Mrs. Carr, and one of her
nieces also claimed the money. The law
of the order says that "should all the
beneficiaries selected by the member die
before the decease of such member the
benefit shall be paid to the heirs of the
deceased member dependent upon him or
her; and if no person or persons shall be
entitled to receive such benefit by the laws
of this order it shall revert to the relief
fund." Upon inquiry it was discovered
that none of the claimants were dependent
upon Mrs. Carr. and the claim was not
allowed to either. The matter was re
ferred to the supreme vice councilor and
grand recorder, to prepare a full state
ment of the case and law for transmission
to Rainbow Council. The matter will no
doubt be brought into court to have the
law of the order juaicially determined, as
the order is ready to pay the money as
soon as it can be ascertained who is en
titled to it.
The officers elected for tho current two
vear term were then installed by Past
Supreme Councilor C. M. Arnold, and the
session was closed after addresses by the
new officers.
To-night the grand officers and repre
sentatives will be the guests of Evans
and Golden Gate councils at a reception
to be given in the Social Hall of the For
esters' building.

ISMMiiifYwEDUCATORS IN
ANNUAL SESSION
Teachers' Institute in Mission
High School.
President Bergerot of the Directors and
Mayor PheSan Deliver Addresses.
Work of Sections.
THE annual session of the Teachers' i
Institute of the city and county of
San Francisco began at 9 o'clock yes- j
terday morning In the auditorium of
the Mission High School. Every Beat was
taken and among the prominent persons
who occupied seats on the stage and par
ticipated in the exercises were President
Bergerot of the Board of Education, May
or Phelan and Prof. - Dresslar of ihe
University of California, The hall was
artistically decorated with pink and blue
bunting, national flags and flowers and j
ferns. President Bergerot in his address
gave the teachers a gentle hint that they
must keep up with the progressive spirit
Of the age if they hoped to retain their
positions; as mossbackism would not be
tolerated in the department.
The general assemblies are held morn- j
ings and evenings, the evenings being de
voted to section work divided among the
several grades. An interesting and "'"
structive illustrated lecture was delivered
in the Girls' High School last evening by
Professor J. Liberty Tadd of Pennsylva
nia on "New Methods in Education."
As a preliminary to the addresses it the
assembling of the teachers in the morn
ing the children of the fifth and , th
grades, under the direction of Miss Es
telle Carpenter, marched on the stage and
sang several pretty selections. Superin
tendent of Schools R. H. Webster, ex
officio president of the institute, then wel
comed the teachers and briefly outlined
the work to be done.
"It is ; , matter of gratification to know
that the movement represented in this
meeting has met with so much sympathy
from the leaders In education," said the
speaker, "and I must express my thanks
to the Board of Education and Its presi
dent who Is With us here to-day, to Pres
ident Jordan of Stanford University and
to the faculty of the University of Cali
fornia for their sympathy and support."
President Webster then introduced
President Bergerot of the Board of Edu
cation, who made a short address, in
which he said he believed that San Fran
cisco was entering upon a new era in edu
cational and municipal matters and ex
pressed the belief that with the new char
ter the best interests of the people would
be protected. Continuing he said:
"Our Freeholders deserve the plaudits
and the gratitude of the people of San
Francisco, and this is particularly true
In regard to the public school, which, In
spite of its delects, 18 representative of
tne best traits of American character.
Uur public school system is the bulwark
of our civilization, and there is no sacri
fice that we are not willing to make to
maintain its integrity. But our public
school system is yet in its infancy, and
what does not progress retrogrades. The
baneful influence of politics has tended to
lower the tone of our public schools, but
I am happy to say that this evil tendency
is in a fair way of being eliminated.
"Some of our teachers execute their
work, In a perfunctory' manner, as if the
community owed them a livipg. There
are others who do not keep in touch with
the best literature Of their profession.
Under the charter such teachers as do
not come up to the standard will be elim
inated. The new Board of Education is
animated with the termination to place
the public schools on a Bound, economical,
financial basis. We hope you will co-op
erate with us In bringing order out of
chaos."
Mayor Phelan was then introduced and
spoke on the "Importance of the Perma.
nent Improvement of Our Public School
Department." He referred to the dis
graceful record of the last board, and
said it was a matter of congratulation
that the city had been able to secure such
a good and efficient board as the present
one. *
A city offers a great many induce-,
ments for a population to remain within
Its limits," continued the Mayor, "if it
permanently improves i's educational
system. We need not fear the loss of our
pre-eminence In this respect, for San
Francisco is a natural educational center.
For the sparse population of California
our two great universities are remarkable
and these educational institutions at our
door furnish a strong guarantee of perma
nent improvement In our school system.
"We have accomplished much in the
new charter, under which a fund will be
created so that the teachers will be sure
of their salaries at the end of every cal
endar month, and the charter will also
give us the means of providing new build
ings. In this connection I desire to say
that If there is one thing that the last
board did for the city that is not a mat
ter of regret it is in giving us this mag
nificent building."
The Mayor referred to the necessity of
looking after the health of the pupils In
the public schools. He regarded that as
of even more Importance than the educa
tion of the youth, and in conclusion ho
felicitated the teachers on the municipal
legislation which he declared would re
sult In lasting benefit to the school sys
tem of the city.
At the conclusion of the Mayor's ad
dress a recess of five minutes was taken,
and upon reconvening a vocal solo was
very pleasingly rendered by Mrs. C. W.
Mark. Dr. F. B. Dresslar of the Depart
ment of Pedagogy of the University of
California was then Introduced to deliver
an address on "Hygiene In Public
Schools." He said In part:
" 'A good mind In a good body,' it is
said. 1 will go further and say. 'Good
morals In a good body." While I am a
thorough believer In education, I believe
more In good health, and if we can help
the children to acquire a good education
in a healthful way we are doing a great
deal for the State. We need better air.
If we want pure air we must continually
change the air in the school rooms so it
won't create a draught. We hear a great
deal about children being overworked. A
certain amount of fatigue Is necessary
and healthful. Merely . being awake and
sitting up produces a certain amount of
fatigue. : - : :.-'
"We want strong, healthful, vigorous,
quiet, determined people as teachers,
because we as Americans particularly
r.ecd It. If we are going to be of the
most service to ourselves, teachers, let us
take care of our health. Let us take
plenty of sleep, as this is the only real
method of relaxation.
"Children in the upper grades often get
too little sleep. They have too many par
ties'at home. If children do school work
properly they haven't much time for any
thing else.
"Variety cases fatigue. Recitations
should be changed frequently, but not too
frequently, because the other extreme of
too much variety tires, too.

"Many of our children become near

rooms Very few of our textbooks have

"Brain workers need physical exercise.
We need more fresh air, more play
grounds. Gymnastics is workâ children
need play." ",'â¢'- v â¢
The programme for the afternoon con
sisted of section work. Section 1 con
sisted of the teachers in the first and sec
ond grades, with Miss Mary A. Deane

CLARK'S DEFENSE OPENS.
Experts Will Be Called to Testify to
His Mental Condition.
The case of Joseph Clark, now on trial I
for the murder of Joseph P. Gross in No- !
vember last, again occupied the attention j
of Judge Dunne's court J-esterday. The j
case of the people was completed Boon i
after midday, and then H. Digby John
ston, an English barrister and formerly
a member of the English House of Com
mons, senior counsel* for the defendant, !
opened his case, occupying the remainder
of the sitting with the story of the de
fendant's life and the circumstances
which resulted in the homicide.
At the conclusion of the opening argu
ment the case went over till this morn
ing. At the opening of court to-day wit- !
nesses for the defense will take the stand
and give their views of the killing. Louis
P. Boardman, who, with Mr. Johnston, is i
handling defendant's case, is building the
technical end of the fight. Witnesses to j
testify as to the conditions which might
and as a rule produce temporary aberra
tion of the mind will be called by the 1
defense. Among these Dr. S. Bishop will ;
take the stand. For a period of years
Dr. Bishop was the resident physician of
the Nevada Insane Asylum, and is an au
thority on diseases of the mind, the
causes of such diseases and their effect.
Other physicians of standing will be
called, and even though Clark's liberty
is sacrificed the defense is confident that
his neck can be saved the pain of frac
ture on the gallows.

NOTABLE BUILDING FOR
THE BUSINESS DISTRICT
Pelton Water- Wheel Company Erects a Splendid Structure
on Main Street.
A NOTABLE addition has been
made recently to the buildings in
the manufacturing district south
of Market street. The new struc
ture has been built by the Pelton Wa
ter Wheel Company to replace the one
occupied by them during the past ten
years. It Is on the east side of Main
street, between Mission and Howard
streets. As shown in the illustration.
It is a four-story, structure, with an
ornamental front of buff brick. It cov
ers a lot 68% feet by 137% feet, | and
provides 20,000 feet of floor space, all
to be used by the Pelton Company.
The main floor will be given over to
show rooms and the manufacturing
department. The latter will be brill
iantly lighted, the roof being com
posed almost completely of glass. The
second floor will be given over to the
SUPERVISORS WILL
GRANT THE PETITION
Mutual Electric Light Company
May Erect Their Poles.
A Majority of the Board Are Said to Be
Now in Favor of Helping the.
New Company.
THE war against the overhead wire j
systems of the electric light and I
telephone monopolies was warmly j
waged yesterday afternoon before j
; the Street Committee of the Board of j
I Supervisors, and it developed an intima- '
{ tion of what ultimate disposition would ;
! be made by the majority of the board of
the petition of the Mutual Electric Light
| Company to be allowed to erect poles out- j
j side of the fire limits. The resolution I
| praying for this privilege was lost at the }
! last meeting of the board, but Supervisor j
! Lackmann saved It from absolute down
fall by changing his vote from aye to no
and moving a reconsideration.
When the resolution Is brought up in '
its regular order at next Monday's meet- !
ing of the board it will be amended j
', slightly by Supervisor Aigeltinger and in j
; all probability passed by the board. In fact ]
1 it is almost a certainty that the majority |
I of the Supervisors will vote to grant the â 
; Mutual Electric Light Company permis- !
j sion to erect and maintain poles and an !
overhead wire system outside of the fire j
| limits. Supervisor Aigeltinger's amend- '
| ment will' not affect the general Import j
of the resolution. It simply makes It in- j
I cumbent upon the Mutual Electric Light j
Company to share Its poles with all other
competing light companies whether in ex- j
istence now or those which may come to I
life after the granting of the privilege.
j The Supervisors feel that they are
justified in placing this obligation on the
i Mutual Electric Light Company in order i
j that they will not be compelled to issue
| privileges of the same kind to other com- I
! peting companies, thus disfiguring the I
beauty of the outside districts. Supervi-
I sor Aigeltinger stated yesterday that he i
was almost absolutely certain that a ma- |
jority of the board would support his
amendment when the matter was brought
up at the next meeting of the board.
The inquiry regarding the attitude of
the various telegraph, telephone and elec
tric light and power companies on the
proposition to compel them to place all
their wires in the downtown districts un
derground was particularly interesting,
inasmuch as representatives of all the
lighting, telephone and electric companies
were present.
F. W. Dohrmann, president of the Mer
chants' Association and others interested
in the advancement of the city's interests
were present at the meeting. Mr. Dohr
mann addressed the committee on behalf
! of the Merchants' Association and made
several suggestions, the adoption of any
j one of which would lead the board out of
j the present difficulty.
"We believe that the various corpora
tions operating overhead wire systems
should be ultimately compelled to place
their wires underground, but we believe
j In giving the companies sufficient time
jln which to accomplish the change. I j
suggest that we all meet some time next
week and discuss In an informal manner
and in good faith a plan whereby this j
can be successfully accomplished. Mayor i
I Phelan'B plan of municipal ownership of
I one line or system of poles in the outside i
general offices and draughting' rooms,
while the third and fourth floors will
contain the pattern shops and pattern
store rooms. yi ; y-^yyy
At present the building seems out of
place in its dingy surroundings. On
all sides the buildings are of old style
and are marked with the smoke from
foundries and mills. In the new era of
prosperity which authorities on com
merce predict is approaching this is
expected to be but the pioneer In the
rehabilitation of. this portion of the
city. The building was designed by W.
J. Mathews of Oakland. The water
wheels of the company in which water
Is used to develop power have been
sent to every country on the globe.
Peru, Mexico, Central America, Alas
ka, Australia, Victoria, have plants
, which are used In mines and other in
districts would quickly settle the difficul
ty arising over the refusal of the board to
allow the Mutual Electric Light Company
to erect and maintain poles in the dis
tricts outside of the fire limits."
"Do you believe, as the representative
of the Merchants' Association, that mu
nicipal ownership of electric light and
telephone poles in the outside districts
would solve this problem?" asked the
Mayor. â¢ â¢
"1 know nothing of the technical nature
of the proposition new before us," return
ed Mr. Dohrmann, "but speaking of It In
its general nature I should think It would.
I see no reason why the light, power and
telephone and telegraph companies should
object to placing their wires underground
as far as possible within the fire limits,
but I believe in giving them sufficient time
in which to effect the change. Overhead
wires arc- a menace to firemen in the per
formance of their duty, and it is time
some steps were taken to place them un
derground."
President Crockett of the San Francisco
Gas .and Electric Company was called
upon and he stated that his company
was placing its wires underground as far j
as possible in the downtown districts, and
had been doing so wherever it had an op
portunity during the last three years. Mr.
Crockett, In answer to a question put to
him by the Mayor, stated that he could
not estimate the length of time which
would necessarily have to elapse before
all wires could be placed underground.
Mr. Green, who represents the electric
light branch of Crockett's company, stat
ed that If the board ordered the company
to place all its wires underground it would
be compelled to abolish its Townsend
street plant. . f-;:^,. '.;'â ..;.; .;',v:
, "Why would that step be necessary?"
asked Supervisor Holland.
"Well," said Green, "we would have to
abolish fully a thousand arc lights now
operated by an overhead current. New
lights would have to be purchased and
erected, and we would be compelled to fit
up this plant for an underground sys
tem." ,?'i'i--.
Louis Glass, general manager of the Pa
cific Telephone and Telegraph monopoly,
was called upon by the committee to fur
nish information concerning the overhead
telephone system, and on the possibility
of compelling his company to share the j
same poles with the light and power com
panies in the event of the municipal own
ership idea being adopted by the board.
"It would be practically impossible," he
said, "for our company to string our
wires on the same poles as the light or
power companies. It would mean ruin to
both our service and our system. Joint
occupation of poles is simply out of the
question. The induction when we run
parallel to light or power lines is strong
enough to be dangerous to our service
and patrons. Fully 80 per cent of our
telephone lines have been placed under
ground, and It is only in places where
we are compelled to run our lines up on
the side or over the top of frame build
ings that we use poles within the fire
limits. The distribution of our current
and wires is the difficult problem that
we have to contend with."
L. D. Storror, representing the Postal
Telegraph Company, and Frank Jaynes,
superintendent of the Western Union Tel
egraph Company, both appeared before
the committee and expressed a willingness
to place their wires underground at any
time or under any conditions which the
board saw fit to impose. -
"All we want is a reasonable length of
time in which to make the change, said
Mr. Jaynes in accommodating tones.

are: A. P. Brayton* president; A. P.

ge.'; L. A. Pelton, consulting engineer;
David Donzel, secretary, and Edward
L. Brayton, treasurer.
"We have only one pole In the fire lim
its, and that one stands in front of our
building," said Mr. Storror, and a faint
suggestion of a smile, struggled at the
corner of his mouth.
"Are you willing, to remove that one?"
asked Supervisor Aigeltinger.
The peals of laughter which followed
the Supervisor's question drowned out
Mr. Storror's answer, but the assuring ;
shake of his head left little doubt as to
his answer.
W. R. Hewitt, superintendent of the
fire alarm and police telegraph system,
was called upon to answer several ques
tions in relation to the technical portion
of the matter in hand.- Mr. Hewitt stated
that though the telephone wire may not
be safe when placed on the same pole
as a light or power wire, it would be ab
solutely safe If run in the same under
ground conduit. y_ Â
"There is absolutely no reason, he said,
"why the telephone wire cannot be placed
on the same underground wire conduit
as the light or power wire. The city can
erect a pole system outside the fire limits
for about $115,000. If such a system was
erected it could be so arranged that the
light and power wires could be strung
on one set of poles and the telephone and
police and fire alarm wires on another.
After a long discussion on matters per- |
taining to the municipal ownership of the
overhead wire system and the ultimate
ownership of the telephone and electric
light and power plants the meeting ad
journed, the representatives of the vari
ous companies interested agreeing to meet
with the Merchants' Association next
Monday at the rooms of the association
In the Mills building. W. R. Hewitt was
instructed by Mayor Phelan to be present
at the meeting and report to the commit- i
tee all suggestions and statements made j
by those interested in the discussion.

LAST FRIDAY'S BREAK.
The New York circular of Henry Clews, writ
ten the day after the break in industrials last
week, says: "The market is in a shape from
which wide fluctuations may be expected. Yes
terday we had an illustration of this in a sharp
breakdown of a certain group of Industrials,
which extended its effects through the general
list. That break should have come during the
latter part of March, as I prognosticated it
would, but there was united action to stem the
current at that time by a number of powerful
leaders with a view of bridging over the Ist
of April settlements, expecting easy money
thereafter. Their calculations as to the speedy
return of money to this center having mis
carried, they lost their grip in holding the
market and in the severity of the raids which
caught an innumerable number of stop orders
and weakly margined accounts. To the deluge
of stocks from this cause Is due the bad break.
It Is a very healthy reaction and not any too
severe considering the high prices that most
properties had attained. The recession in
prices now makes a new basis for an early
upward spring movement and Insures active
trading during the summer months which but
for the marking-down process would not have
been likely, for to have gone Into a bull sum
mer campaign on the high range of prices that
had been reached would have been like build
ing a mountain on the apex of another one.
"The firmness of the money market is to be
regarded as, on the whole, a healthy symptom,
as it is an evidence of business activity. Be
fore the expiration of this month, certain
operations requiring large transfers of funds,
however, will be out of the way; after which
there Is nothing ln sight to prevent a steady
and comparatively easy state of the loan
market until next fall."

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. April There was a wild
rush to buy at the opening, and the specialties
made large gains, part of which they retained,
while the railways, which had improved smart
ly, left off at about yesterday's figures. The
rise of Americans in London before the open
ing and the momentum of yesterday was re
sponsible for the early excitement In the mar
ket. Call money ranged from 4 to 5, closing
at the lower figure, and sterling exchange was
strong throughout, demand sterling rising %.
The rapidity of the early advance Induced
heavy realisations, but a general tone of
strength' prevailed until the afternoon, when
some sharp recessions occurred. The killing
of American and /English navy officers In
Samoa seemed to arouse apprehension in some
quarters of further complications. Among the
specialties strong features were Brooklyn
Transit, Consolidated Gas, People's Gas,
Sugar and the iron and steel shares. Balti
more and Ohio Issues, Norfolk and Western
preferred and Northern Pacific were strong.
Foreign houses were early purchasers but re
sold about half as much on the local rise.
Some of the foreign purchases were connected
with London's fortnightly settlement. A
number of shorts were driven to cover early,
owing to the commission house demand, es
pecially for Industrials, because of a more lib
eral position taken by a number or banks
toward such stocks. The market closed steady.
There was more activity in railroad bonds to
day, and while a few Issues were shaded,
the general average was slightly better on the
day. Total sales, $3,760,000. United States 3s
advanced % In the bid price.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET. â¢
CHICAGO, April 12.â Reports of crop condi
tions were the chief considerations again with
wheat speculators at the opening, and those
being of unvarying tone of badness the mar
ket opened strong. Receipts here and in the
Northwest were small, Chicago getting only
thirty-five cars, of which two were graded con
tract, and Minneapolis and Duluth 188 cars,
compared with 142 a year ago. The Missouri
Weather Bureau report of wheat conditions in
that State said many correspondents reported
half the wheat killed, and the lowa State re-
I port claimed late sown wheat was about all
dead and early sown seriously damaged.
Private reports were almost unanimously of a
most discouraging character with regard to the
Injury done. Those were not repetitions of
previous reports, but from fresh sources. May
opened %Â®%c higher at 71%Â®71%c. and dur
ing the first two hours rose to 72% c. At that
point, however, realizing commenced and
forced the price back again to 71%@71%c.
Damage claims again became popular, how
ever, and were given the most consideration.
There were several ups and downs as the ses
/ sion progressed, with trade very light. On
one of the downward reactions about forty
minutes from the close some heavy shorts at

THE BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, April 12.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
Some of the large woolen mills, including
both those which are in the combine, have
been represented in the market during the j
past week and have purchased very liberally
of wool. The Washington, Wanskuck ami
Pacific mills have been especially prominent \
and they have taken some very large lines :
of territories, Oregon % and %s blood j
fleeces. The sales of territories alone aggre- !
gate over 4,000,000 pounds, which, combined
with those of other lines, make a total busi- j
ness. for the week of nearly 8,000,000 pounds.
Th.-re Is no change to note in prices, how
ever. The sales of the week in Boston amount
ed to 7,461,000 pounds domestic and 466.500
pounds foreign, making a total of 7,927,500,
against a total of 4.263,800 for the previous
week and a total of 530.530 -for the correspond
ing week last year. Sales since January 1,

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
Reports from the coming crop are coming in
every day now. and while It Is too early for
any definite statement it may be said that
from indications up to date Peaches will be
the only heavy crop, Apricots will be slim,
Pears are not showing up well on the river
and Cherries and Prunes are dropping more
or less, owing to the dryness of the ground
last year. This Is the state of the crop at
present, but H is liable to change any day.
Receipts were 22 boxes Cherries and 37
chests Strawberries.

Mail advices from New York say of Prunes: i
"Prunes are tendtnz upward because of en- j
larged demand and the close concentration of
stocks here and in California. Total holdings
on the coast will scarcely exceed 200 cars, and
one firm Is said to control the bulk of them.
The same condition exists here, consequently
advances are expected on all sizes and quali
ties. At present demand appears to be re
stricted, though there Is strong Inquiry, and
some out-of-town dealers are seeking supplies
to carry them over the spring activity before
there Is another advance. The outlook Is hope
ful for holders, but at the moment actual busi
ness Is comparatively light."

Brown and the Twins.
"Yes." said Green, "I always thought
well of Brown until last night."
"What did he do last night?" asked
White. : .â¢;
"Well, you know," the first went on,
"we've boys at our houses, two of 'em,
twins, and as fine a pair of youngsters as
mortal man ever laid his eyes on. They're
bouncing fellows, and for the past week
all the neighbors have been in to see
them. Most of the girls Gertrude knows
have given the babies something, and
some of the men have sent over little
trifles like shaving mugs and cigar cases
and the like, to be saved for the boys un
til they're old enough to use them. We
expected a nice present from Brown and
his wife, for both Gertrude and I knew
them well before we all up and married.
Of course Brown was told of the twins
shortly after their arrival in this vale
of tears, and every evening we expected
he and Mrs. Brown would be over. They
came last night. Brown wanted to see
the boys, yet as they have never had any
little folks in his house, he hardly know
what to say. They were brought out by
the nurse, and he took one on each knee
holding them close to him, with his arms
around them, you know. Well, he" look
ed at them, blushed a little, appeared
rather foolish, and blurted out, "Brothers,
I presume? What do you think of that?"

GOLDEN RULE CAPTURED THE
STAKE EVENT.
Tar Hill Left the Maiden â Ros
inante First in Handicap Paul
Griggs Led Over the Line
by Headwater. : r
The mile and p. Quarter event on the
card at Oakland yesterday was a "feeler"
for th* Derby. There were four starters,
with Corrigan's Corsine a pronounced fa
vorite. The surprise stable of E. J. Bald
win also started one that had been pick
ling in the brine for some timeâ Los Me
dar.es. On April 7 the brown colt started
Jn a mile and -a sixteenth race raptured by
Joe Ull man, and while showing speed at
one stacre of tho journey was beaten by
the winner more than a dozen lengths.
The members of the ring chalked up 10 to
1 against him, and even the silverites
passed him up. He made all the running
and won from the favorite under restraint
in 2:08%. The winner is a good looking
piece of racing material, and should be
hard to beat on Saturday. Oiir.thus was
also a starter, but Shields choked him to
death while trying to rate tho chestnut
colt, and he ran last.
The attendance continues to grow
lighter every dny. Three favorites were
beaten
oeaien.
Corrigan won the Olympic stake at four
and a half furlongs with Golden Rule.
Winyah was not trying, and Burdoc took
second place from Moana.
The mile and a furlong handicap was
the one interesting feature of the after
noon. Rosinante and Topmast ruled equal
choices In the betting, and ln a drive Jen
kins landed the former winner by a head,
Plan finished at the saddle girths of Top
mast, but was disqualified and the show
given to David Tenny.
The knowing ones all put the checks
down on Billy Randall's entry Tulle i
in the opening mile and a sixteenth run.
Fending him to the post favorite. Show
ing the way for a mile the Montana horse
then tired and was passed by Peter
Weber, an S4-pounder, ridden by See,
which won easily. The winner was 4 to 1
in the betting.
Corrigan's Artillery filly Art ilia was the
redhot one in the "kindergarten" scram
ble, but a straggling start contributed to
her defeat, and the young miss finish*
third. Tar Hill, with Macklln tip and
once 7 to 1 in the ring, led throughout.
winning hands down from Flush of Gold.
The gray horse Paul Griggs was downed
in the six furlong dash by Headwater.
The filly closed favorite over him. and
though he made a stubborn chase after
her was led out over a length in 1:13%:
Guilder, unable to stand the hot clip set,
finished a fair third.

Oakland Is in Hard
Luck.
The directors of the California League
at a meeting last night voted to disallow
i the protest of San Francisco against the
! game with Sacramento on April 1, and
| that of Santa Cruz against Sacramento
; in the game of April 8, on account of the
I playing of Hughes, a National League
: player, by that team. There were pres
| ent at the meeting President Moran. Vice
President Bert, Secretary Bonnet, Mana
! gers Harris of San Francisco, Kripp of
! Sacramento, Struve of Watsonville,
| Borchers of San Jose and Swing of. Oak
; land. Secretary Bonnet represented
\ Santa Cruz by proxy.
When the matter of the protested
! games was taken up, Manager Kripp i
said he was not aware of the California i
| League's membership in the national I
j agreement, as he had not been officially I
. notified, a statement that was corrobo- !
i rated- by the president and secretary,
who admitted they had failed to send
! out the notification.
Harris said he filed his protest to es- j
i tablish a precedent and to systemize the j
affairs of the league, and not because he |
wanted any games he had not fairly won.
Upon this, both protests were thrown out
by the board of arbitration, consisting of
I the president, vice president and secre-
I tary. Manager Kripp's action in playing
Hughes merited severe precautionary
'. measures against a repetition. His ex
cuse, that he did not know the league was
i under the national agreement, will hard
{ ly hold, in the Santa Cruz protest, at any
rate, for Manager Harris' protest the
week before J ought to have been suffi
cient notice ' to him. Yet he played
Hughes the following Saturday, and
; would in all probability be playing htm
vet had Hughes not departed for the
East.
However, the board took steps to pre
vent a recurrence of the trouble by
i adopting a rule that any club using an
I ineligible player shall forfeit the game
and be fined $100 as well.
President Moran announced the release
; of Umpire Creamer, and the appointment
of Mr. O'Gonnell of San Francisco in his
i place. Creamer has caused general dis
satisfaction by his work.
The positions of the league teams have,
been changed considerably since a week
I ago. By winning two straight from
Santa Cruz Sacramento goes to the top,
and the Fresno team, by defeating Wat
' sonville twice, takes second place, send
: ing Watsonville, who led a week ago, to
I fifth place. Oakland and San Jose are
! tied for third place, and Santa Cruz
brings up the rear. The percentage is aa .

San Jose is bound to show some marks
in Its error column whenever Fatty Klei
ner is In the game, for the big fellow
never shirks anything that comes his
way. He handles many drives that would
be safe hits with anybody else in the po
sition, but of course there are some that
he cannot handle cleanly. It is surpris
ing how easily he gets BO much avoirdu
pois over the ground.
Santa Cruz is smashing the ball as hard
as any of them this season, but does not
seem to have settled down into its regu
lar fielding gait yet. Unseemly errors
have been responsible for most of its de
feats so far. The boys were handicapped
at the start, however, by having their
grounds converted into an ideal duck
pond just when they wanted to begin
practice. With the grounds in good con
dition again, the Crabs will soon be In it
.with the others.
Oakland Is the "hard luck" team of the
league this season. Losing three of its
best men In two days is enough to worry
any manager, but (Swing is not discour
aged, and announces that he will take
I both games from San Jose this week..
It is expected that Hammond will be in
I condition to catch for the Oaklands this
' week. Dunleavy and Donovan, however,
i wi-il not be in shape to play for some time.
The San Jose team play the Stanford
1 College team a game of hall every day
I this week, thereby giving both teams the
best kind of practice.
There appears to be two cliques in the
Watsonville team, each seeking the con
trol of the team, and as a consequence
; the chances of the club are greatly in-
I jured by not getting the best efforts of the
; players.
George Harper and Ham Tberg will be
I the opposing twirlers In Sunday's game.
! This ought to insure a splendid exhibition
I of the pitcher's art, as both players are
! complete masters of scientific pitching.
In the contest at Watsonville last Sun
day neither team made th.- semblance of
an error until the ninth inning, when the
- Watsonville catcher made an error on a
I thrown ball to second base.
The games this week will be as follows-
Watsonville comes to San Francisco, Oak
! land goes to San Jose and Sacramento
I will play at Santa Cruz.
Two errors were responsible for that

Hammond and Lange accepted- the
chances offered them San Jose would

score at. the end of the ninth would have
been a tie.
SACRAMENTO, April 12.â The game
has caught the capital city and no mis
take. More interest has been manifested
so far this season than at any time since
the days when the old Alias dished, out a
quality of baseball that would make the
hair assume a perpendicular position.
Fully a thousand people witnessed the
game last Saturday between the Sacra
mentos and Santa Cruzans, and double
that number went out to Oak Park the
following day to see the same teams per
form. Many more would have attended
the Sunday game had the 'weather been
more pleasant. ;.je . â¢ ',â
The "cranks are "tickled to death at
the team's winning three out of Tour,
which puts them in front place. Last sea
son the Senators- started off in first place
and were never headed. Wonder if they
are going to repeat the dose? - -
"Jay" Hughes and Harry Loehhead left
for the East last Sunday night. Both are
to play in the major leagueâ the former is
on Brooklyn's pitching staff, while the
latter will cover shortstop for St. Louis.
Lochhead's departure was a surprise even
to his most intimate friends. It was
known he signed with St. Louis late last
fall, but owing to the fact that the Cleve
land team was switched to St. Louis it
was thought "Loch's" chances of going to
St. Louis had gone a-gllmmering. About
three weeks ago, however, a ticket and a
piece of advance money came to the big i
shortstop and he wired back "Will come.
The loss of Loehhead is a great one, and
the team will feel it keenly. . Â».
Henry Stulz will in all probability be
signed to take Lochhead's place, but with
all due respect to Mr. Stulz we are sure
the contract will be too great to enable !
him to Jump into immediate favor with
the local "fans."
The local team has the distinction of be
ing the only team in California which .in
tho past three years has developed Na
tional Leaguers. The Senators manage
to turn out at least one each season, and
last season both Harvey and Doyle could
have signed with teams In the big league,
but they preferred to stay on the coast.
Pittsburg was hot after Harvey all
through last season, and he ignored tele
gram after telegram. Doyle could have
gone with Loehhead to St. Louis. Stan
ley, our crack catcher, can' play in the
East whenever he desires to, as several
teams are after this star backstop.
Warren W. Beckwith Jr., the new ac
quisition, is proving himself to be a great
ball player. He has Just arrived here from
Chicago, and is a great friend of Mat
Stanley, having played with him two sea
; sons in the Texas League. This same
j Warren Beckwith has had quite a little
romance. It will be remembered that not
I so very long ago there was an elopement
! in the family of Robert B. Lincoln, son
j of President Lincoln, which set the news
papers and gossips all over the country
i talking. Beckwith, who at that time had
i Just graduated from one of the big East-
I crn colleges, was a great football player
and general all-round athlete of no mean
I ability. He became infatuated with Rob
ert Lincoln's daughter, but her folks
would not hear of her marrying Beck
with, and the couple were obliged to elope.
This proceeding greatly angered the pa
rents of the young bride and they refused
to recognize the marriage, and further- \
more they disowned their daughter. After
I the elopement young Beckwith took his
wife to Chicago and he began playing pro
fessional ball. His profession took him
all over ball. countryâ to Missouri, to
over the countryâ to Missouri, to
Texas, to Colorado and finally to the
Golden Suite. He Intends settling down
now that the Llncolns have been recon
ciled, and intends to make California his
future home. His wife will Join him as'
soon as he "gets settled." She is at pres
ent with relatives in Denver, Colo.
Next Saturday and Sunday the team
plays in Santa Cruz. The boys will
make their first appearance in their new
uniforms, which arrived from the East
Monday. These uniforms are by far the
"swellest" in the league.
Tommy Sheehan, the little round fel
low, as he Is termed at home, is playing
the fastest ball Imaginable. He is surely
the "find" of the season. He has caught
on with the local "cranks" for keeps.
Beckwith may be put in to pitch one
of the games in Santa Cruz this week.
The lad has plenty of speed and good
curves. He has pitched before; in fact
that was his position while in the Chi
cago league. :;â¢-â¢;->-
Tim Shanahan still looks after the first
bag â¢in his same old style, and we might
add that he still retains that "same old
smile." 'â¢â â 'â¢ . â '. '.'-'â¢-.â 
"Kid" Peeples la playing a great third
for the Senators. He continues to prac
tice faithfully, and will soon work
around to his old-time form.
,The entire team practices for two solid
hours every day in the week but Monday
and the days they play, It is the faith,
ful practice that does as much as any
thing toward landing the pennant each
season.

BERKELEY, April 12.â The delegates to |
the State Sunday-school Association met
this morning and afternoon in the First
Congregational Church on Dana street. A
fair attendance of Sunday-school teachers
from a"l! over the State made the disucs
slons quite exhaustive. Papers were read
upon the salient points connected with
religious teaching for the young. A ques
tion box added much to the interest of
the gathering and brought out new ideas
connected with this special branch of
work. V-* -

FORGET-ME-NOTS
PLACED ON TOE
MOTHER'S COFFIN
Funeral of the Late
Mrs. Yon Schmidt.
CHILDREN'S TOKEN OF LOVE
PATHETIC SCENES ATTEND THE
SERVICES.
Brother and Sister-in-Law of the De
ceased Were Overcome by Grief
and Had to Be Carried
From the Church.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
f!42S .Park street, April 12.
Rosa Alexis and Edwin yon Schmidt, the
eldest of the five children of the late
Captain and Mrs. E. A. yon Schmidt,
each placed a little bunch of forget-me
nots on their mother's coffin to-day and
tearfully bade a last farewell to the little
woman whose pleasure on earth had been
In caring for them.
The funeral services were held this
morning at the Unitarian church. The
scenes and incidents attending the last sad
rites over the earthly remains of the mur
dered woman were pathetic ln the ex
treme. The bereaved relatives present
were Major and Mrs. C. E. Tilden, the
three older childrenâ Rose, Alexis and
Edwinâ and Charles Hill and wife of
Denver, Col., brother and sister-in-law of
the deceased. Colonel A. W. yon Schmidt
Is prostrated at his home and could not
be present.
When Mr. Hill walked down the aisle
of the church and caught the first glimpse
of the flower-laden casket containing the
remains of his murdered Bister, he was
completely overcome with grief and
swooned before the bier. Tender hands
assisted him to a chair and friends tried
to persuade him to leave the church until
the trying scenes were over. He insisted,
however, Upon remaining through the ser
vices, lie had to be carried to the casket
to take a last look at his dead sister. His
cries and moaning, as he fell across the
coflin covering his sister's face with kisses
and his tears were agonizing. He had to
be almost torn away from the dead, and
when he turned from the casket ho fell
helpless Into the arms of his friends. His
wife also fainted during the services and
was carried from the church.
The three little children bore up bravely
under their burden of woe. Major Tllde.n
lifted each one up to the coffin, and as
they looked for the last time on their
mother and impressed a final kiss on her
stilled lips they cried as though their
hearts were breaking. Each, as gently
lifted away, divided a little bunch of for
get-me-nots carried, placing half in the
casket with "mamma" and clinging to the
remaining fading little flowers, significant
of that love and reverence which will bo
the guiding inspiration through life.
During the services Mrs. Flelssner-
Lewls and Miss Florence Young sang "So
Fades the Lovely Blooming Flower' and
"Abide With Me." Miss Young rendered
a contralto solo, "O Love Divine," by
Kevin.
The chancel and pulpit were a mass of
rosses, calla lilies, marguerites, palms
and ferns, and the bier was beautified
with roses of bite and pink.
Rev. G. R. Dodson, who conducted the
services, spoke in the following touching
manner of the deceased:
"My friends death gives a new per
spective to a human life. It causes the
unessential elements to drop out of sight
and leaves only the main outlines and
grand features of the character. I am
glad to unit-- with you now in paying a
tribute of respect to the life that was
so suddenly quenched In Sunday's trag
edy. It was the life of a woman, one of
Eve's daughters, a wife and a mbther,
an admirable character, irreproachable
and altogether worthy of the esteem and
love of her neighbors and family. While
it Is not my habit to make personal refer
ence on an occasion of this kind. I feel
it my privilege as a Citizen, now that she
Is gone and her sad story is becoming
known, to do her the justice to say that
Bhe stands cleared of every evil Insinua
tion ever made against her character.
"By those who have known her long
and intimately, and whose word I im
plicitly trust, she is described to me as
having been exceptionally brave and
cheerful in the trying circumstances
which were her earthly lot.
"Buoyant, courageous, unselfish, she
did her best. Though the mother of five
children, she still had some room in her
heart for other little ones who had no
one to love or care for them. Without
neglecting her own household she found
time, with other ladles, to establish In
our city a home for homeless children.
"Now her brief and eventful life Is over.
She has been torn away from her little
rood, ln loving and caring for whom
Ehe found her highest happiness.
"Poor, brave little woman! Even were
you alive now little could we help you,
and now that you are gone you are alto
gether beyond us. I thank God that good
ness dwells In the hearts of men and wo
men, and that other love will do its best
to supply the love of the mother's
heart. : . /
The pallbearers were: C. J. Lancaster,
Alexander Baum, J. W. Burnham and 1..
J. Healy. The remains were cremated
at Odd Fellows' Cemetery, San Fran
cisco.
The funeral of Captain yon Schmidt will
be held to-morrow afternoon from Pio
neer Hall. interment will be at Laurel
Hill Cemetery.
FIXING OF 6RANDES'
SENTENCE IS DELAYED
ATTORNEYS YET TOO WEARY TO
MOVE.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 12.
William A. Brandes, convicted of the j
murder of his little daughter, was not I
sentenced to-day, and his wife, Etta Bran
ded, also awaiting trial on a murder
charge, was not released on a writ of ha
beas corpus.
Both matters came up before Judge
Hall, but Attorney Sawyer asked for fur
ther time in which to arrange the fabric
upon which he will base his motion for a
new trial in Murderer Brandes' cause.
The attorney stated that "the court un
doubtedly realizes how tired the attorneys \
(were at the conclusion of the protracted :
trial," and he said also that he "did. not
have the heart to go over tho mass of
testimony," because It made him sick to
look at it. There being no objection on |
the part of the District Attorney the mat- 'â¢
ter went over for one week.
The case of Mrs. Etta Brandes likewise
went over for another week. Judge Hall
stated that he, too, had been tired and
had found little or no time to examine I
the testimony adduced at Mrs. Brandes* !
preliminary hearing: The accused mur
deress has now occupied her cell at the
Counts. Jail since last November, yet she j
appeared In court to-day in very cheerful i
spirits
Brandes' attorneys have applied to the
court for payment for the expert wit
nesses employed ln his defense. This ap
plication will perhaps end a contention
that has been going on in the Superior 1
Courts for many years.
There Is a statute which permits the '
payment of expert fees ln criminal cases
upon the signed order of a Judge. In the
trial of Clara Fallmer the matter was >
brought up by ex-Judge Frick. In this
case several experts on insanity were em- !
ployed on either side, those for the prose
cution receiving $50 apiece. Judge Frick â 
handed in bills for the payment of the ex
perts for the defense, but they were de
nied. Judge Ogden holding that the stat
ute required that the Judge should name
the experts If the State should pay for
them.
In the Brandes case the attorneys for
the defence BU_mmonedi.t_i_r.owa_eÂ«P_erta_
-Â»____.. '_jK___^___Â£_tt___a_-M-_g*Â«-IS----WH--l_
and now Attorney Bennett is asking that
the county pay their fees. Judge Hall
stated that he did not wish to establish
a precedent in this matter without con
sulting his brother Judges, and took the
matter under advisement.

ff/""\H! mamma, please don't drink that nasty stuff!" cried little Ellen
J I Caswell as she saw her mother taking poison. The childish request
M was not heeded, the suppliant attempted to prevent by force her
mother's suicide, but in vain. The little arms-could not restrain the
will of a woman bent on self-destruction.
Mrs. Warren Caswell of the Homestead, near Hay wards, ended her life
this evening by taking a drink of carbolic acid. There was no one in the
house at the time but her 6-year-old daughter, and although help was sum
moned by the alarmed neighbors it was of no use, for Mrs. Caswell had done
her work too well. -,-â¢
The little daughter being the only witness was the only one who could
throw any light on the tragedy, and between her sobs she told a pitiful story
to the Deputy Coroner.
"When I saw mamma take the bottle with the red label on I knew she
must not drink it," she said. "Mamma told me never to touch that bottle,
for it would kill me if I drank any of It. I told her not to drink the nasty
stuff, but she did not seem to hear me. Then I ran up to her and tried to
take it out of her hands, hut I could not. I am not strong enough to take
anything from mamma. She just would drink It, and now I have no
mamma." - . :â -..
Mrs. Caswell has been sick for a long time ahd has recently been de
spondent, though her husband had no reason to fear that she would take her
life. When he left home his wife was in her usual mood and gave no hint
of the fearful tragedy she was contemplating. Mrs. Caswell was 33 years of
age and the daughter of Mrs. Van Hoosear of Castro Valley.
THE SAN FBAISrCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 13, 1899.
YOUNG WIFE
CONFESSED TO
EVIL-DOING
Promised to Reform if
Given a Chance.
CHILDREN TAKEN AWAY
> - .
SIGNED AN AGREEMENT TO BE
HAVE THREE MONTHS.
The Tempter Came Along and at Once
the Pledge Was Broken Hu
sband Abducts the
Boy.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 12.
Mrs. Carrie Reuter could not behave
herself three months even to Insure for
her the custody of her two little children
of whom she is very fond. In court to
day Charles Reuter, who was divorced
from his wife some months ago, ap
peared to answer a charge of abducting
his little boy, 6 years old. Mrs. Reuter
charged that her ex-husband had gone
to the place where she was keeping the
child and taken it away in violation of
the decree of the court.
Reuters attorneys practically ended the
case by producing a little document,
which was an agreement made by Mrs.
Reuter on February 16 of this year, stat
ing that she would behave herself and
leave the red wine alone for three months
If put on probation and allowed to retain
her little one. Mrs. Reuter Is a comely
young woman, 25 years of age, and until
a tempter crossed her path and taught
her the habit of wine drinking she was
as good a young mother as any husband
could desire, according to the testimony.
The agreement produced in court does
not mince words. It opens with a con
fession by Mrs. Reuter that she had been
guilty of conduct which made her an un
fit person to' look after her children, but
she promised to quit bad acquaintances
and reform if given the chance to do so.
Her ex-husband gave her the chance. A
week ago he became possesed of Informa
tion which caused him to tremble for
his children's welfare, so he went to Mr*.
Reuters house, found his children dirty
and in rags, although he had "regularly
paid a stipulated amount for their main
tenance, and found the most undesirable
company ln the house. He took the chil
dren away. This morning he produced
them in court neatly dressed and look
ing very attractive. Evidently Mrs. Reu
ter had not told her attorney of the con
fession and agreement she made last Feb
ruary, for when It was sprung by Reuter
the mother's lawyer asked to see it and
at once requested the court to grant a
continuance. The case Is such that Ren
ter is confident he will be allowed to keep
the boy, although on account of Its ten
i der age the mother may be permitted for
1 a while to keep the baby girl.
HUNTING AND FISHING
ON MARIN COUNTY LANDS
The Supervisors of Marin County will
meet to-day in San Rafael, and among
matters that will claim the attention pf j
the board will be the proposed ordinance j
which, if passed, will prohibit the ship- |
ment of fish and game out of Marin i
County.
According to the State game laws the
Supervisors of the' different counties have
the power to ordain thai fish or game
shall not be shipped out of their county,
but when the Legislature vested that
power with the Supervisors it did not say
that game or fish when ln possession of
any person shall be subject to confisca
tion.
The intention of the Legislature at the
suggestion of the sportsmen of the State
was to stop the destruction of game and
lish by those who hunt and fish for the
markets, and with that object in view it
gave the Supervisors of the different
counties of the State the power to pass
ordinances to prevent the shipment of
game or fish out of their respective coun
ties.
Some of the leading counselors of this
city who were addressed on the subject
said that the Supervisors have the power
to curtail the shipment of game, but that
the confiscation of game or fish in season
by a constable or county officer when it
Is in possession of a sportsman or an an
gler returning from an outing -would be
an act conflicting with the general game
law of the State. The Supervisors of
Marin County can close the shooting sea
son to all sportsmen if they feel so dis
posed, but they cannot make a distinc
tion by placing a prohibitory measure on
sportsmen or anglers who do' not reside
in the county. Such an act would, ac
cording to legal opinion, be decidedly un
constitutional. â  *..
Doubtless the enemies of the Country
and Tamalpais Sportsmen's clubs are the
instigators of this latest move in matters
that pertain to fish and game, but the
Supervisors of Marin County, if they had
the power to shut off outsiders from en
joying the pleasures of the chase, would,
in the opininon of many residents of the
county, be inflicting a great injustice upon
the hotel proprietors and stable-owners of
the county, many of whom reap rich har
vests from visiting sportsmen and anglers
during the open seasons for fishing and
hunting.
Return of Rosenthal.
The return of the great pianist, Morltz
Rosenthal, to this city for two farewell
matinee recitals at the Grand Opera
house on the afternoons of Tuesday and
Wednesday, April 25 and 26, Is already at
tracting a full quota of attention at the
hands of local music lovers, and from the
present outlook the two recitals will be
attended by audiences calculated to crowd
the immense theater. Those who were
unable to secure seats for the last recitals
given here by Rosenthal will no doubt
be early in line to secure reservations,
and It will no doubt serve them well, as
all those who have already heard the
wizard of the piano will once more at
tend, and as the prices have been cut In
half for the coming engagement all
classes of music lovers will find it pos
sible to enjoy the concerts. Rosenthal's
return here will precede his sailing for the
Antipodes on his tour of the world. In
Australia his tour will include all the
larger cities, and already the managers
ln the land of the kangaroo are said to
vie with one another to secure the pianist.
MURPHY STOPPED
A RUNAWAY HORSE
A runaway occurred on Market street
yesterday afternoon about 2 o'clock, and
for a few minutes It looked as if there
would be urgent need for the ambulance
or Morgue wagon. Had it not been for
the prompt and brave action of Policeman
Murphy serious accident might have re
sulted. The animal, which was a big bay
nag full of ginger and spirit, started to
run from Lotta's fountain and dashed up
the street as far as Grant avenue, de
molishing one buggy that was left stand
ing close to the curb on the south side of
the street, and nearly' killing another
horse that was attached to a light buggy
which was also standing near the curb a
few yards further up the street.
The runaway belonged to M. W. Bode,
who lives at 2201 Fulton street, and was
attached to a light business buggy. When
Bode left the buggy he fastened the horse
with a light rope to a hitching pest In
front of the building." A band of music
passed down Market street, and the ani
mal becoming frightened started on a
mad run up the street. The thoroughfare
was crowded with pedestrians, who flew
in all directions to escape being knocked
down and trampled upon.
Opposite Grant avenue the maddened
animal shied off to the south side of the
street, nearly banging into a passing car.
The rear end of the buggy swerved sud
denly, knocking down a horse that was
standing near the curb and nearly break
ing his leg. The collision stopped the
frightened animal for a moment, but be
fore anybody could reach the spot the
horse started off again and ran a few
yards further on, where he collided with
another animal. Both horses fell -down,
but the force of the collision sent them
both sliding along the cement sidewalk,
scattering women and children in all di
rection. Before Bode's horse could re
gain his footing Policeman Murphy threw
himself upon his neck and pinned him
down to the sidewalk.
RIODE JANEIRO IN PORT.
The Pacific Mail steamer Rio de Janeiro
arrived late last night and anchored in
the stream. She left Hongkong on March
14 and Honolulu on April 5. and carried
with her thirty cabin passengers sixteen
European steerage and 171 Chinese and
Japanese. Everything is reported quiet
at Honolulu, but there Is an unusual ac
tivity ln the stock market. Since ihe an
nexation stocks of all kinds have been
steadily going up and there appears to be
no limit to the prices which will be paid.
The cargo on the Rio is also unusually
heavy. She carries 2800 tons of freight,
among which are 3800 bunches of bananas,
195 bundles of silk, 1700 packages of rice
and 81 bags of mail.
Among the passengers Is W. .F. Rice,
deputed to visit Japan as a special agent
of the Bureau of Immigration and Labor.
In the Divorce Court.
Stella Aldrich was granted a divorce
from Claude B. Aldrich by Judge Heb
bard yesterday on the ground of extreme
cruelty. Emma Esterberg has been
granted a divorce from Gustav Esterberg
on the ground of willful neglect. Suits
for divorce have been filed by Cora L.
Mitchell against William K. Mitchell for
failure to provide, and Joseph Lebade
against Katherine Labade for desertion.
San Francisco Charter.
The charter of San Francisco forms the
subject of a volume which has just been
issued by Edward F. Treadwell, LL.B. of
the San Francisco Bar. An Introduction
on the nature of municipal charters pre
cedes the charter itself, which has been
carefully annotated with a number of
cases cited besides code and constitu
tional citations. â ::â ?','.â :. *

LEES DEFENDS THE
COURSE OF PRICE
Says He Is Innocent of the
Charge of Corruption.
The Police Commissioners Commence
Their Investigation of the
Chinatown Scandal.
THE portentous "sack" which is Bald
to exist in Chinatown and which,
it Is Claimed, has tempted Lieuten
ant Price and his squad was the
subject of Investigation by the Po-
lice Commislsoners last evening.
For several hours the Commissioners lis
tened to the reading of the report of Chief
Lees, "which is calculated to exculpate
Price and his men of the charges of cor
ruption which have been brought against
them.
At 11 o'clock the head of the Police De
partment had not concluded reading his
report, and as Commissioner Tobin was
not feeling well he suggested that ihe in
vestigation be continued until next Mon
day night. A motjon to that effect was
made by Commissioner Alvord and im
mediately carried.
The Chief's report, as far as he read,
was a resume of the work done by Price
ln the Chinese quarter. Several months
ago, ho claimed, a number of Chinese
merchants waited on him and asked that
Price be sent to subdue the disorderly ele
ment In Chinatown. As a number of
wanton murders of inoffensive Chinamen
had been committed. Lees sent Price to
assist Sergeant McManus, who was then
in charge of the Chinese quarter. Shortly
afterward McManus was relieved at his
own request and Price instructed to take
full charge.
The Chief declared that Price's work
ln Chinatown was eminently satisfactory
to him. He gave a list of gambling joints
Price had broken up, and reiterated that
as far as his investigation went ho had ab
solutely no proof that either Price or his
men were guilty of corrupt i practices.
The dally reports of Price and his men. he
said, showed that they had made more
arrests and collected more money than
any other sergeant and squad who have
been In charge of Chinatown.
"In 1894," continued the Chief, .reading
from his report, "Lieutenant Esola. who
had been in Chinatown for two months,
was withdrawn, as the Commissioners
and myself had an abundance of evidence
showing that he could not make a raid
without being accompanied by Andrew
Lawrence, managing editor Of the Ex
aminer. Lawrence was with him nearly
all the time, and as there were some ugly
rumors floating around which did not re
flect much credit on the editor in ques
tion, I decided, after a consultation with
the Commissioners, to withdraw Esola.
Lawrence in his paper severely criticized
the Commissioners and the department in
general after that, but as I knew I had
beaten him at his own game I paid no at
tention to his diatribes.
"Shortly after Price's character was as
sailed he visited my office and demanded
an Investigation. He vigorously denied
that he was guilty of the charge of cor
ruption and pleaded with me to withdraw
him from Chinatown. I assured him of
my belief in his honesty and told him to
continue as he had been doing until such
time as the Commissioners Investigated
the charges preferred against him. Dur
ing my secret investigation I learned that
an ex-convict named Thomas Droulet was
responsible for some of the stories re
flecting on Price and the men which were
published in the Examiner. Droulet, who
is also known as Kelly, is a Chinatown
bum. Ho has served several terms in
San Quentin and Is a confirmed thief.
Some time ago he was thrown out of a
window by a woman who Is known as the
"Galloping Cow" and sustained a. fracture
of the skull. Since then he has been a
driveling Idiot.
-'Gambling has materially decreased
since Price has been in Chinatown." con
tinued the head of the department,
"reading from his voluminous report."
"I understand that it has been in
creased." interjected Commissioner To
bin. ln a rather sarcastic tone.
"we will prove that in court or any
where else," hotly replied the Chief.
"It was called to my attention," con
tinued Lees, "that Price was issuing
COLE FOUND HE
WHS NOT THE
WHOLE BOARD
School Directors Sup
press Him.
Chairman J. B. Cole of the committee
on janitors of the Board of Education, had
impressed upon him at the regular meet
ing last night that a committeeman Is not
the whole committee nor is a committee
the board. In the course of the evening's
business, when the reports were being
called for in their regular order. Secretary
Simpson called for that on janitors.
Mr. Cole, as chairman of the committee,
presented a report recommending several
dismissals and appointments of others in
the place of those deposed. Mr. Cole, the
proposer, cast aside recognized customs
and moved its adoption. On its face the
report seemed all right, but Director Hol
brook asked by whom It was signed. This
elicited the information that Mr. Cole
alone stood sponsor for it. Directors Head
and Conlan declining to be parties to its
recommendations. President Bergerot j
asked for the majority report of the com- j
mittee, but none was forthcoming. There- !
upon he declined to entertain the report
presented.
Director Cole tried to explain in an in
coherent manner that he had presented
the report to his colleagues for their sig
natures, but that they had declined to Join '
him in his recommendations. " He ex
plained that some Janitors were on the list
of dismissals upon the recommendations
of principals of schools. That from long
years of service they acted as though
they could do as they pleased in neglect
ing their duties. Others were included in
the list because he had evidence of their
neglect He spent several days in the
month on a tour of investigation, and
found that the rooms In a number of
buildings had not received proper care*.
President Bergerot dealt firmly but
kindly with the Director. He would not
permit the report to be presented. The
remaining ten members were a unit in
their views of the matter, hence there
will be no changes among the Janitors for
the present. â¢
The session of the board was a short
one. The important committees had
nothing to report, so the proceedings, aft
er the Cole incident, were merest routine.
The committee on rules recommended
that leave of absence be granted to: the
following teachers: Mrs. B. Linehan, Miss
K. H. Paxton, Miss B. Levingston, Miss
N. E. Ewlng, Miss M. A. Manning and
Mrs. M. A. Hogan.
Applications were received from the fol
lowing teachers asking that they be ex
cused from attending the Teachers' Insti
tute now in session: Walter S. Braun, A_
H. McDonald, Ellen Castiehun, Jennie L.
Powers, A. E. Roberts. A. J. Dannan
baum, C. S. Hendry, Smith O'Brien. John
McHenry, William Drew. James P. Bal
loun, Charles L. Turner, Miss Jennie Kie
nan.
Demands for salary were received from
Rose M. Stack and Mrs. Morrisey and
were referred to the finance committee.
A petition for a new school was received
cards to Chines, restaurant keepers, al- '
lowing them to continue playing music j
until 1 o'clock in the morning. The cards
bore the "name of the restaurants and
were signed by the lieutenant. I sent for
him and demanded to know why he had
overriden the law to the extent of allow
ing music to be played after midnight:
He explained that the Chinese were hold
ing their annual festivities, It being their
New Year, and that he saw no harm in
it. I told him it was against the law
and he promised that it would not occur
again.
"To show what schemes the Chinese will
resort to, I deem It proper to make pub
lic a forgery which was evidently In
tended to entrap me. On March 15, 1898,
I received a note purporting to have been
signed by the Consul General asking
the privilege of exploding lir.crackers be
tween certain hours on the following day.
I suspected that the signature was a for
gery, and, calling in my clerk, dictated a
reply to him, which was to be sent to the
Consul General, In a few days I received
an answer in which the Consul General
declared that the original letter was a
forgery and excusing tho crime by say
ing that one of his servants must have
written the request for the benefit of
some friend."
The Chief was about to descant on the
scheming methods of the Chinese in gen
eral when Commissioner Tobin, who nad
evidently grown tired while listening to
the Chief's report, suggested that further
hearing of the report be continued until
Monday night, which was adopted.
Before taking up the investigation of
Price and his men the Commissioners
tried Policeman John Crowley, charged
with failing to report for duty. On March
19 Crowley- visited a restaurant on Davis
street, where he met Sergeant Wolf and
two ladles. Crowley was unable to re
port for duty at midnight and at his re
?uest Sergeant Wolf went to the Call
ornia-street station, where he informed
the officer In charge that Crowley was
sick and unable to do patrol duty.
The matter was reported to Lieutenant
Blrdsall, who sent Sergeant Monahan to
investigate the story of Crowley's alleged
sickness.
Monahan visited his house and was sur
prised at not finding him there. Con
vinced that there was something wrong,
Captain Wittman preferred charges
against the officer. Officer Edwards tes
tified that he saw Wolf, Crowley, another
man and three women standing at the
corner of California .and Kearny streets a
short time before the watch reported on.
He reported the fact to acting Desk Ser
geant Young. The latter notified Lieu
tenant Blrdsall, who sent one of his men
to Crowley's house. The witness denied
that he said that the women were "hay
bags" or Barbary Coast rounders.
Officer Young testified that Crowley was
accompanied by a woman named Mrs.
Mclntyre. In answer to Commissioner
Gunst's questions, he said that the char
acter of the woman was bad. Captain
Wittman, when sworn, said that Crow
ley had told him that the Mclntyre wo
man was "stuck" on him, and that he
couldn't "shake" her.
Commissioner Gunst rather testily
asked why the case had not been brought
to the attention of the Police Commission
before.
"This offense occurred on the 20th of
last month," he remarked. "I should like
to know why the charges were not in
vestigated at the last meeting."
Chief Lees replied that he had read the
charges and expected that they would
be brought up shortly after the occur
rence.
"I spoke of the case at the recent meet
ing." remarked Gunst. "I would like to
know who is to blame for this seeming
negligence."
"Captain W right had the charges,"
hotly retorted Lees.
"Excuse me," interrupted Gunst. "It
must be Wright's mistake."
Alter listening to the statements of sev
eral witnesses to the effect that Crowley
was sick and not drunk, the Commission
ers decided. to dismiss the charge against
him.

PRETTY GIRLS IN TABLEAUX
AT THE GINGERBREAD FETE

C ,- -)HK gingerbread fete for the
\ benefit of the Children's Hos
pital was Inaugurated yester
l day afternoon under the most
pleasant surroundings in Gold
en Gate Hall. The afternoon ; hardly
found the ladies prepared to entertain
their guests, but by evening every
thing was in perfect order and run
ning as smoothly as though tho enter
tainment was a full week. old.
For the opening day it was a splen
did attendance. Fashion has lately
decreed that I openings are no longer
the* very swellest affairs, and judging
by that it is evident that before the
fete comes to Its happy conclusion the
hall will be unable to hold those as
sembled, and that money will pile up
and fill to overflowing the capacious
coffers of the. worthy charity.
The programme arranged for the
evening went off with remarkable
success. The "Clippings From Life"
and "Miniatures" ; were beautifully
posed, and the curtain was parted
again and again to the merry tune of
palm to palm thunder.
The arrangements of the hall com
bine at once beauty and comfort, the
booths ranged round the walls, making
a background of brilliant colors. From
the door where you hand in your paste
board to the stage that bounds the
further extremity of the hall Is one
long line of artistic effects.
Variety must- have been the watch
word of the skillful decorators that
converted the plain bare hall into the
gorgeous fete. No one booth resem
bles the other. Each has a distinctive
feature particularly. appropriate to its
kind, making comparison -impossible.
One booth is only prettier than an
other Judged from an individual stand
point, and there is enough diversity to
please all tastes. More than a dozen
booths filled with' comely matrons and
fascinating belles appealed to the fash
ionable assemblage- and each booth
did a thriving business. -
In addition to the booths there are
the art gallery, with its wealth of rare
art works; the "hospitable table," a
miniature reproduction of the bene
fited institution, and looked after by
Mrs. Merrill, the Misses Leontine and
Juliette Smith, the. Misses Hughes and
Miss Bates; the wonderful doll house,
for which little Whittier Bothin dis
poses of raffle tickets, and the Bedouin
tent, with its Oriental Inscription, be
neath * which the palmist reads your
past and predicts wonders for the
future. Miss McNeil read the . palms
last- evening, but to-night the great
Foeselli will be on hand. .
