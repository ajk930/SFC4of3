All manner of theories are enter

There Beems to have been nothing
whatever that would cause him to
either take hi 3 own life or run away

by his wife, his brother,
Charles Starr, S. R. Smith, manager,
and S. D. Rosenbaum, owner of the

most positve in their statements that
he was in the best of health, and that
his family and other relations were
pleasant and happy. They also agree
in the statement that he had no ene

terms with his brother and all the em-

the mother of two small children, is
heartbroken with grief at the eudden

worked in a packing houst- for S. R.
Smith, the same man under whom he
is now working at the Oak Knoll
ranch.
Mr. Smith speaks very highly of
Starr, and he is confident also that his

untary act of his own. There was $600
In the bank to Starr's credit as super
intendent of the ranch, and of this
amount he drew but $200 on last Fri

entire amount in paying off the hands
and other necessary expenses. Stan

talk over matters pertaining to the

on Monday evening that he disap

might be thought to indicate that Starr

WARDNER IS
TURNED INTO
ARMED CAMP
Strikers Fire the First Shot
and Further Trouble
Expected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WARDNER, Idaho, April 26.â The
first shot has been fired and this Dlace
has suddenly been turned into an
armed camp. The strikers were in ses- j
sion all night long at their hall. At 5:30
o'clock a compact body of men, headed
by President Boyles, started uo the
canyon. They halted a short distance !
from the Bunker Hill and Sullivan
mine.
Soon after. In little bunches, came !
the non-union miners to go to work. ,
They were stopped by the strikers, and j
Boyles urged them not to go to work, j
One or two of the non-union men tried I
to push through the crowd of strikers. :
but were forced back, with the remark !
that the union did not intend them to j
go to work. Then T. S. Murray, a j
leader of the strikers, drew a bie re- j
volver, which he leveled at a bunch of â 
Bunker Hill employes.
"I tell you what the proposition is."
he shouted; "you walk down that hill
; again inside of four minutes, or else go >
1 down some other way."
He drew his watch and as he counted
j the seconds the working miners fal- ;
tered and started down the hill. A half I
dozen of them went into Black's board- j
ing house, on the main street of the '
town. They were pursued into the i
house by strikers.
"What will we do with them?" j
: shouted somebody.
"Run them down the canyon." wasthe
reply. With that they started the non
union men toward the foot of the town,
i Dr. France, Coroner and physician of
! the hospital, remonstrated.
"We will run you out bf town, too."
i some one shouted, and one of the
Strikers struck him in the face. The
j doctor stepped aside and was not fur
ther molested.
The strikers then dispersed and the
non-union men were invited into a
; friendly saloon and then later returned
to the boarding house.
Later, in a fight between a number of
strikers and the men from the Bunker
Hill, one of the union men fired the in
itial shot of the strike. It was directed
jat a door behind which some of the
working miners were believed to be in
hiding. To-night no attempt was made
to interfere with the working force, and
about eighty men went on duty when
the shifts changed.
Sheriff Young arrived from Wallace
to-day.
To-night armed men are on euard
both at the Bunker Hill mine and the
mill. They halt all comers and demand
the countersign. The strikers have
tapped the telephone betwen the mill
and mine, and are intercepting all mes
sages. _____________
STEAMSHIP CRASHES
INTO A BRIGANTINE
The Blakeley Almost Cut in Halves
Amidships by the Homer
at Seattle.
SEATTLE, April 26. -In broad daylight
early to-day the steamer Homer crash) <1
into the brigantine Blakeley, which was I
moored fas* to her dock, and almost cut!
the vessel In halves amidships. This Is I
th( second collision within two months
the Homer has had in daylight while
coming into her dock. In fact, the
steamer was on her way from the *s hip- I
where the injuries she sustained i
when she collided with the Al-Ki had
i ust been repaired when slit ran into the
Blakeley.
Captain HigÃins of the Homrr claims
the accident this morning was due to tin
fact that the ropes to the bells In the
engine-room broke and ht- was unable to
control tho steamer. The inspectors at
this point blamed the Homer for the Al-
Xi collision, but on appeal to the Super
vising Inspectors at San Francisco this
decision was reversed, and the Al-Ki then
brought a suit for damages against the
Homer, which Is pending. Captain Hlg-
Klns takes all the blame for the collision
to-day.
The Homer Is again on the ways, and
the UlakÂ»-ley, by shifting the cargo and
lifting the breach in her side above
water, 1? still at thn dock.

IMMENSE
LEDGES OF
COPPER ORE
Montana Mines Rivaled by a
Discovery Recently Made
in Washington.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April 26.â The largest cop
per ledges ever found in the Northwest
have been uncovergd in the Carbon
District, north of Mount Rainier and
sixty miles east of Tacoma. They be
lo-ng chiefly to Cheater Thorne, presi
dent of the National Bank of Com
merce of this city, who has kept men
at work on them for several years. His
superintendent, Thomas Wflkins, said
tv-day in describing the new discovery:
"An immense body of ore exactly
similar in character and geological sit
uation to that fonnd in Montana has
bet n located in Carbon. The ore we
have been taking out of the Clipper
mine has been running $75. The tunnel
has struck a vein, which has just been
assayed and shows a value of $186 60
to the ton. At the current price of
copper it will be worth about $193 80
per ton. There is an immense solid
mountain of ore in that district, from
which radiate scores of large, rich
veins. We have found over fifty paral
lel veins of this ore running from east
to west all through the Leola proper
tits. The ore runs in one sample 293
ounces of silver and ninety pounds of
copper to the ton; in another it is 127.5
ounces of silver and 125 pounds of cop
per. It is chalco-pyrite. containing a
great deal of native silver. The Butte
mines are of the same material, but not
any richer. Heretofore they have been
regarded as the richest in the world.
We can mine ore at about one-half the
expense. The Butte mines ship all their
coal from Missouri, while we have coal
and wood right at the mines.
"The new discoveries are about six
miles from Fairfax Railroad and we
will ship the ore to- the Tacoma smelter.
The cost of production will be about
$30 per ton, leaving a bonus of about
$150 per ton. The ore from which the
richest specimens were obtained came
from a five-foot vein in the Clipper
mine. A fourteen-foot vein has been
found in the Apex and six-foot veins
in the Carbon, Pyrite, Rockford and
i 'Umax. All these properties are owned
by Mr. Thorne and associates. They
will put many men at work on the
properties as soon as the snow is off
and the ore will be shipped out imme
diately.
â¢'This same rich ore has been found
on my own property, the London. It
extends to several other claims owned
by different men, forming a great ore
basin. It will startle the world when
its development gets fully started."
Mining men agree that Thorne and his
associates will be made immensely rich
by these discoveries. His associates
include Judge C. E. Richardson, his at
torney, and John Heitman, the original
locator of the Clipper mine.
D. O. Mills of New York and Alvlnza
Hayward of San Francisco arrived here
last night on a trip of Inspection of
Northwestern properties, in which they
are interested. Mr. Mills visited the
Tacoma Bmelter, which is being en
larged to four times its former size
with capital supplied by him and his
associates in control of the Bunker Hill
and Sullivan mine in Idaho and the
Treadwell mine in Alaska. Both of
these are making extensive shipments
of ores and concentrates to the Tacoma
smelter, which is being enlarged with
the primary object of handling their
output. Hereafter 200 tons of ore wili
be smelted daily instead of fifty tons
as formerly.
To-day Messrs. Mills and Hayward
joined President P. B. Cornwall of the
I '.<â¢!] ingham Bay and British Columbia
Railroad at Whatcom. They will ac
company him to the scene of the recent
coal discoveries on Cornwall Creek, in
the Mount Baker region.
President Cornwall's carriage yester
day was shipped to Sumas, the present
terminus of the line, where it will be
used to-morrow to convey the party to
Cornwall Creek, a distance of twenty
three miles. The tunnel, now In 600
feet, has uncovered an eighteen-foot
vein and the prospect is so favorable
that Superintendent Donovan has ad
vised the extension of the road to the
new mines. Their visit will determine
whether this shall be done. Mr. Mills
will next go to Alaska to look over the
Treadwell mine and decide on proposed
improvements there. After returning
he will be accompanied East by White
[ law Reid, now in California.
MATT QUAY
TO GET SEAT
IN SENATE
Friends Claim a Poll Shows
That He Has Plenty of
Supporters.
SIXTY- SEVEN VOTES
It Is Asserted That a Deal Has Been
. Made Whereby Pennsylvania
Will Support McKinley.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 26.â A Plttsburg
(Pa.) special to the Herald says. Close
friends of M. S. Quay claimed to-day
they have information that the Senator
has completed n preliminary poll of the
United States Senate and secured the
absolute pledges of s|xty-seven votes in
favor of seating him on the commission
issued by Governor Stone. There will
be only eighty-six Senators in the up
per branch of the Fifty-sixth Congress,
owing to the deadlocks in Delaware.
California, Pennpvlvania and Utah, so
that forty-four votes would be suffi
cient to insure the. seating of Quay.
Quay's lieutenants say he will not'
have less than sixty-seven, and some of
them say they believe that there will
be no concerted opposition whatever,
owing to the fact that three national
chairmen of the Republican, Demo
cratic and Populist parties are in fa
vor of giving him a seat.
These three c Hanna of Ohio. Jones
of Arkansas and Butler of North Caro
lina. It Is also intimated now that after
Quay's managers decided to maintain
the deadloe'.. to the end of the Legisla
ture a careful poll of the Senate was
made which at the time assured a fa
vorable termination of the contest for
the seat, and that the McKinley ad
ministration fell in line with this pro
gramme with the understanding: that
the Pennsylvania delegation to the next
I national convention will support the
i Canton man for renomlnation.
Quay men say the Democratic affec
i tion for tl.e Senator dates from the
i time that he engineered the retirement
! of the force bill.
General W. W. Dudley, of "Blocks of
Five 1 fame, who was counsel before
the Senate Committee on Judiciary for
Henry W. Corbett of Oregon, who
' claimed a seat in the oenate on the
; appointment by. .he Governor of that
i Btate, practically confirms the story t
that Quay will bo s^a'.-'d.
"Quay will be recognized," he said.
he case of Corhett is no precedent.
That case w as nev^j determined on its
merits. Had It gone to a vote in the
: Senate Mr. Corbett would have been
I seated."

APPEASED.
DEWEY AND

GOOD FRIENDS
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YO ~.K, April 26.â A Manila ca
ble to the World says: Admiral Dewey
was seen to-day by the World corre
spondent on the Captain <^oghlan inci
dent. The admiral is still unacquainted
with the details of the famous speech,
but he declared that his relations with
Captain Coghlan are most cordial. He
received a cablegram from the captain
of the Raleigh when that warship
reached Algiers, congratulating the
admiral on his promotion.
Admiral Dewey is certain that Coch
lan could not have said anything cal
culated to place the admiral In a false
position. He showed the World cor
respondent a letter from Admiral yon
Diederichs of .lie German navy, con
gratulating him on his "deserved pro
motion." and also his letter In re
ply, which closed with the words. "All
our differences were of newspaper
manufacture." '
The admiral says he is on the most
friendly terms with Prince Henry of
Prussia, who succeeded Yon Diedericb.3
as commander-in-chief of the German
fle^t in Chinese waters.
Before sending this telegram I
showed the original to Admiral Dewey.
and he made It official by Indorsin-r It
with this line:
"O Xâ George 1 ewey."
The particulars of the Coghlan epi
sode are awaited with impatience.
COMMON SENSE WILL
RULE 'N THECONTROVERSY
LONDON, April 26.â The Earl of Sel
bourne, Under Secretary of State for the
Colonies, addressing a Conservative mass
meeting this evening at St. Albans. Here
ford said he thought that if any justifi
cation of Lord Salisbury's policy was re
quired it was afforded by the present re
lations between the United States and
Great Britain.
"At a trying time, said his Lordship,
"the Government preserved their self
control and waited for coolness, justice
and common sense to reassert themselves.
Now the dark, miserable cloud which so
long hunp over the Anglo-Saxon people
has drifted off. It is only a few days
since British and American officers and
men fell on the same field of conquest.
They were not engaged in fratricidal
strife, but were fighting shoulder to
shoulder; and small though the incident
was, it will be of importance in the his
tory of the world."
All must regret, continued Lord Sel
bournw. the lamentable cause of the inci
dent but the only three nations con
rernrd were what he might term the
"three cousin nations of the world." He
remarked that he had no doubt America
and Germany In this matter would prove
as amenable as Great Britain to the dic
tates of common sense.

MRS. SEMPLE C GEORGE.
CANTON, Ohio. April 26.â The closing argument in the trial of Mrs.
George was in progress when court adjourned this evening. Prose
cuting Attorney Pomerene began his argument shortly after 2 o'clock,
and will probably occupy the greater part, if not all, of to-morrow
Â» forenoon in completing it. It isnÂ»w thought that the jury will be
charged Immediately after the noon recess on Thursday.
The day -was without snecial incident, so far as the accused was con
cerned. Mrs. George sat all day with downcast eyes, and was occasionally
moved to tears as the story of her life was narrated.
The courtroom was thronged from early morning: to the hour of ad
journment and many who could not gain admission stood in the courthouse
corridors all day to get what they could hear and see at long range.
KAUTZ SAYS
GERMANS DO
NOT LIKE HIM
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, April 26.â A letter
written by Rear Admiral Kautz to his
cousin, Mrs. Charles Lindley of Cin
cinnati, has been made public by the
recipient. It is dated March 23 and is
In the easy vein of a relative's private
correspondence. In the letter he says:
"You will probably read a lot of stuff
about me in various newspapers, but 1
can assure you that I am all right and
have done nothing that I or my friends
may be ashamed of, unless It is the mak
ing of a King, which I am obliged to do
to-day. But he is a very inoffensive sort
of young: fellow, a native 19 years old.
He wears a French admiral's cocked hat,
but no shoes or stockings or trousers, i
Still, considering the torrid weather, he
looks very well in this â¢climate. But I
hardly think he would look as well on
Fourth street, Cincinnati. I am not King
here, but just plain "boss of the ranch.'
The German Consul had that position up
to my arrival, but since'then he has been
a very silent partner. 1 am very much
afraid' he does not like me; in fact, I am
not at all popular here with the Germans. !
But I am all right with the English, and j
hope to pull through with them. I have
no doubt of being sustained by the Gov
ernment In all 1 have done. I hope to
get away from here in a month from this j
time, but will not be in San Francisco
before the middle of May. With love to
the Kentucky colonel and yourself, your
cous l n> ALBERT KAUTZ.
"P. S.â l am in error about the shoes
and trousers of his royal Highness. At
the last moment his advisers prevailed
on him to put on both, just for this oc
casion only. "
WASHINGTON, April 26.â The publica
tion of Admiral Kautz's letter referring
to his position at Samoa caused absolute
consternation at the Navy Department
and State Department at first reading.
but there was soon exhibited a disposi
tion to minimize the affair, because it was
clearly apparent that the letter was noth- ;
ing more than a strictly private communl- ;
cation passing between members of the |
same family. Nevertheless, coming as it j
does close upon Captain Coghlan's indis
cretion and following the publication of !
Judge Chambers' letter to his brother |
criticizing the Germans in Samoa, the
opinion was held that Admiral Kautz'a
letter could not have other than harmful
effect upon the relations between the
United States and Germany.
In official German -quarters the letter
was not treated very seriously, and there
was no Indication that the German au
thorttlee would take cognizance of it. The
spirit of fun in the letter appealed to
some of the diplomatic officers, who i
laughed heartily over Kautz's description
of the young King's make-up, and this
amusing feature largely offset any irri
tation which might have been felt over
the crlticisma contained in the letter.
The Impression prevailed, however, that
the Navy Department probably would deal
with the indiscretion In such a way as it
deserved. J
THE COGHLAN
INCIDENT IS
DULY CLOSED
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 26.â The case
of Captain Coghlan may be considered
as finally closed. The German Embas
sador, Dr. yon Holleben, called at the
White House this afternoon and had a
conference on the subject with the
President of such a satisfactory nature
that the matter was regarded as
settled. The President explained the
course the Navy Department had taken
in administering a reprimand to Cap
tain Coghlan. It was also pointed out
that the officer's explanations of the in
cident stated that his utterances had
been much exaggerated. On the part
of the Embassador there was every dis
position to deal as lightly with the
matter as possible and not to permit it
to become a source of friction.
During the day the Navy Department
administered to Captain Coghlan the
reprimand which had been determined
upon yesterday as stated in these dis
patches. This was in the form of a
letter from Secretary Long to the cap
tain. It is stated at the department
that the letter will not be made public
before the officer has received it and
probably not then.
The department made public a bripf
statement of the contents of Captain
Coghlan's letter in answer to Secretary
Long's request for an acknowledgment
of responsibility of the utterances as
cribed to him. The statement is as
follows:
"Captain Coghlan has replied to the
department stating that the newspa
pers have not reported him with sub
stantial accuracy. Also, that he in
tended no disrespect or contempt to the
German flag and is extremely sorry
that any such interpretation was put
on his remarks. Reprimand will be
sent and such action taken in respect
thereto as is proper."
POPE LEO'S STRENGTH
SAID TO BE WANING
NEW YORK, April 26.â A Rome cable to
the Journal says: The Pope is feeling the
effects of his recent exertions, particu
larly in attending the services in St.
Peter's, and takes a glass? of cordial every
two hours. Without the stimulant his
Holiness would collapse.
His audiences are limited to fifteen min
utes, and after each of them the Pope re
tires to rest.
Vatican authorities think now that the
likeliest successor to Leo is Cardinal Gir
olamo Maria Gotti of Genoa, a Carmelite
monk. He is distinguished for learning
and piety..

MANILA, April 26. There
was hard righting to-day
on each side of the rail
road line, the rebel forces for the
first time using two shrapnel
guns, from which they poured a
heavy but ineffective fire on the
American forces from the north
bank of the Rio Grande River.
General Hale, with the Fifty
first lowa and. the Kansas regi
ment, held the positions 1 on
the east of Calumpit which were
gained yesterday. Wheaton's
brigade, on the west of the
railroad, advanced west of Ca
lumpit toward the Rio Grande,
on the north side of which were
strong intrenchments of the in
surgent forces guarding the rail
road bridge spanning the stream.
There was heavy fighting on
each side. One man in the Kan
sas Regiment was killed and
the Montana Regiment lost one
killed and eight wounded.
Through the kindness of Senor
Villemer I have just received by
carrier pigeon an account of the
advance of Major General Law
ton, whose line of communica
tion had been cut off. The same
bird also brought a message from
General Lawton to General Otis.
The story brought by carrier
pigeon says that two columns â
the first under General Lawton
and the second under Colonel
Summers- met at Norzagaray,
in the hills fifteen miles east of
Calumpit. General Lawton had
marched twenty-eight miles un
der almost insurmountable diffi
culties. This advance is one of
the most notable feats of the en
tire campaign against the insur
gents.
The road over which the ex
pedition advanced is a mere trail
across rough hills. The entire
force had to turn in and help the
'wagon train, as the use of water
buffaloes proved an inefficient
method of transportation, ten of
the animals dying of exhaustion.
The enemy offered little resist
ance. -, ;
Colonel Summers, with his
force, had reached Norzagaray
Sunday morning, taking the
town after a little fighting. The
enemy retreated to the hills. On
Tuesday the American forces
took and burned the village of
Angat, the total loss being five
wounded.
The insurgents continue to fire
on Norzagaray from the hills, but
do not>seem inclined to make a
determined stand, pursuing in
stead guerrilla tactics. ,
AGUINALDO'S ARMY
MAKING A LAST STAND
MANILA, April 26, 6:10 p. m.-
Aguinaldo's army to-day is defending
Calumpit energetically, which Is said
to indicate that the rebels are finally2
making that place their last stand,
which the Americans expected them to
make at Malolos.
For the first time the Filipinos are
employing artillery. They brought two
guns Into action in the trenches to-day
before Calumpit. Fighting was re
sumed at 6 o'clock this morning. Dur
ing the night engineers repaired the
Bag-Bag bridge, thus enabling our
troops to cross the river.
General Wheaton's brigade advanced
in extended order, with the Kansas
regiment to the west of the railroad
and the Montana regiment to the east.
On the opposite banks were fortified
trenches, in which a.few American sol
diers would have been able to defy
thousands, so strongly were they con
structed. The Americana found the
trenches on the south bank of the river
deserted, which furnished them with
cover from which they could pick off
Filipinos whenever one of them showed
his head. When the rebels began firing
two puffs of smoke, simultaneuosly
from the trenches on each side of the
railroad rack, showed they were using
cannon, which as a genuine surprise
to the Americans. Several shells burst
close to General Wheaton's staff, but it
seemed .the Filipinos failed to master
the machinery of modern shells, as they
were unable to get the right range.
young's Utah Battery was ordered
into position in the center of the Kan
sas Regiment to silence the rebel guns.
and at 11 o'clock the rapid guns
had been hurried across the river and
came into line. At noon the rebels
were. still pouring a heavy fire in the
direction of the Americans, who re
turned i; spiritedly.
Two Americans were killed and seven
were wounded.
At about this time General Hale's
Brigade was advancing east of the line,
apparently to cross the river and at
tack the rebel trenches in the flank, as
did the Americans yesterday.
General Mac Arthur has secured an
order issued by .Aguinaldo to the other
commanders instructing them to In
struct their mi to economize their fire,
pave the empty shells and not to fire
at the enemy Â« hen the latter is under
cover. Tho Filipinos are also instruct
, d never to lire at. a longer range than
150 meters, and when they have a river

This order was issued after the cent
encounters between the Filipinos and
the Americans.
General Lawton Is meeting with the
greatest obstacles in the character of
the country. His troops have <-nly had
a few skirmishes thus far, resulting in
five of his men being wounded. But j
he has been forced to put his men at
work building roads and the transport
service giving much trouble, bullocks
dying of the heat and exhaustion and
Chinamen having to be employed in
pulling some of the cars. Therefore the
general has been unable to cover the
ground he hoped to cover.
The natives flee before the expedition,
but they swarm back to their huts as
soon as the American troops have
passed.

A CALIFORNIA BOY
AMONG THE KILLED
THE cable advices from General
Otis yesterday announced the
death of Private Paul J. Gom
pertz, Hospital Corps, First
California Regiment. Gom
pertz's name was among the
list of those killed. As yet no par
ticulars have been received as to how
he met his death. His father, M.
Gompertz, lives with his family at 527
Hayes street, where he conducts a
stationery store. The first announce
ment he had of his son's death was
when he read his boy's name in the
daily papers as being among those
killed. Mr. Gompertz was completely
prostrated by the grief that was so
suddenly thrust upon him. He and his
family feel deeply the sacrifice they
have made for their country, but they
find consolation in the fact that one
of their members met a soldier's death.
Young Gompertz was well known in
San Francisco and had a host of
friends, with whom he was exceed
ingly popular. He was in his twenty
third year. He Came to this city from
New York, where he was born, when
a small boy. When the war broke out
he was employed in the City Hall as
a clerk in the office of Justice of the
Peace Groezinger, but resigned . his
position to enlist with the First Cali
fornia. He sailed with his regiment,
and at the fall of Manila did his duty
in caring for the sick and wounded.
Last October Gompertz was Invalided
home on the Rio Janeiro. As soon as
he regained his health he Insisted on
returning to his post of â  duty at the
front, and he sailed a second time for
Manila. on Nevember 8. on the trans
port Newport. He has been with his
regiment ever since, and during the
recent hard fighting he was many
wounded from the field.

THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1899.
VOLUNTEERS MAY
BE CALLED FOR
Larger Force Needed in
the Philippines.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 26.
It is evident that the administration
is seriously considering the advisability
ailing out the 35,000 volunteers au
thorized by the reorganization bill. The
President is still desirous, as he has
been all along:, to avoid this, but each
day's developments in the East
strengthens the belief that a larger
military force is required. There was
considerable running back and forth at
the White House to-day. General Miles
called on the President for the first
time in weeks, and it was for the pur
pose "f discussing the military situa
tion in the East and the question of
calling out volunteers. . Secretary Al
ger made two trips to the White House.
The President is becoming convinced
that more men must bring the cam
paign in the Philippines to a prompt
close. And his friends advise him that
the political effect of a prolongation of
the struggle there would be much
worse than calling out the volunteers,
to which some objection has been mad^.
A statement in regard to the disposi
tion of regulars has been prepared at
the War Department for the special
benefit of the President and Secretary
of War in considering the question of
reinforcing the army in the Philip
pines. There are now in Cuba 14,868
soldiers, embraced in four regiments of
cavalry, one regiment of artillery and
six of infantry. There are about 3000
t roop s in Porto Rico. The number of
troops in the Philippines and under or
ders to proceed there is 24,000 regulars.
Of the entire 56,000 regulars about 23,000
are still on duty in the United States.
It is not believed that the troops now
serving in Cuba or Porto Rico are
available for any other duty. It is not
likely that the force in either country
can be reduced without impairing th.
efficiency of the military administra
tion of those countries. Therefore these
troops, numbering about 18,000 men,
are not considered in the plans for
strengthening the military force in the
Philippines. The 23,000 soldiers now in
this country are divided into detach
ments assigned to the duty of guard
ing public property at abandoned posts,
looking after recruits and assisting in
the shipment of supplies.
PROTESTS AGAINST BBIGGS.
NEW YORK, April 26.â Bishop. Potter j
recently informed Rev. Dr. F. M. Clen- i
l denln, rector of St. Peter's Church, West
| Chester, that he would hold an ordination '
j in his church on Sunday morning. May i
' 14. It was the Bishop's intention then
j to advance to the priesthood two deacons,
Rev. Charles A. Briggs, a professor in i
the Union Theological Seminary, and Rev. i
I Charles H. Snedeker. Dr. Briggs, whose
i teachings at* the Union Seminary and
! whose published works had- occasioned '
I great controversy in the Presbyterian ;
j church, left that body some time ago and 'â 
j received confirmation in the Episcopal
church. His reception Into that com-
I munion was far from cordial. Later
Dr. Briggs was recommended by the
! Bishop's examining chaplains and by the
] standing committee of the diocese of New
i York for admission to holy orders, and
was made a deacon in the Episcopal
church. The same' authorities concurred
;in his proposed advancement to "the
i priesthood.
Dr. Clendenin. who is ranked as a
stanch and moderate high churchman,
now asks Bishop Potter to alter his plans
and to withdraw tbe proposed ordination
from St. Peter's, Westchester. He ana-
I lyzes Dr. Briggs' last book, condemns his
views severely and flatly protests against
'. Dr. Briggs being ordained at all to the
priesthood.

GERMAN PUBLISHERS
PROMOTE GOOD FEELING
Missouri Newspaper Men Set Forth
the Friendship of the Fatherland
for America.
ST. LOUIS, April 2fi.â The German
newspaper publishers of Missouri held a
meeting here to-day for the purpose of
defining their position regarding the new
policy of "imperialism and militarism."
Dr. Emil Pretorius, editor of the West
licher Post and the Nestor of the German
press of America, presided, and after a
lengthy discussion the following resolu
tions were unanimously adopted:
Iâ Systematic and uninterrupted efforts have
been made during the i>ast twelve months to
destroy, by misrepresentations and unfounded
sensations the good feeling and the old histori
cal friendship between the United States and
Germany. These malicious intentions have cre
ated among the German-American population
the greatest indignation. We therefore regard
it our duty as loyal citizens to denounce these
continued falsehoods and misrepresentations,
which endanger the old friendship of the two
countries.
2â The friendship between the United States
and Germany is as okl as the history of the
great American republic and has lasted un
interrupted. As the Government of Frederick
the Great was the. first Kuropean power which
acknowledged the young republic of the United
;-'tiit<!S, Germany was the first to Acknowl
edge the supremacy of the United States
In the Philippines. This fact alone
proves plainly that Germany has no unfriendly
intentions and no desire to oppose us In the
orient
. 3â ln the glorious history of the United States
from the time of George Washington to the
days of the civil war the German-American
population has shown strong and patriotic loy
alty to the union. In the darkest days of the
republic the German-Americans stood firm and
true by the union, hs> they will do in future.
We German-Americans and the Germans in the
old country have been cruelly misrepresented.
We proved our loyalty during the past war
and will continue to prove It, whatever the
future may bring. But we protest most era
phattcallv against all falsehoods and intrigues
which are intended to interrupt in the interest
of England tlie friendship between the United
States and Germany.
4â True to the constitutions and traditions of
the republic we take a firm stand against im
perialism and militarism, knowing that the
German-American citizens stand almost unani
mously against this new course which would
endanger the welfare and the future of the
republic.

SUPERSTITIOUS
REDS SLAY ONE
OF THEIR TRIBE
Kill and Cremate a Brave to
Drive Out an Evil
Spirit.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 26.â Letters I
received here from J. A. Beauchamn. j
manager of Larue & Pickard's fur
store at Lesser Slave Lake, tell of a j
strange crime, for which two Indians
are now awaiting trial, and of peculiar \
incidents which led up to it. Twenty- j
five Cree Indians are camped fifty miles I
west of the Lesser Slave Lake, near j
Smoky River. On March 25 a half-breed
named Anachou Louison became im
bued with the idea that he was pos
sessed nf a devlL The chief symptom |
was a chunk <>f ice in the stomach. |
Finally, after many strange wander- !
ings about the wilderness, he formed ;
the belief that his appetite couid be j
satisfied on human flesh only. While i
engaged in conversation with the chief ;
of the encampment, soon after his re- !
turn from the t vest, a little band of
children gathered around. Pointing to i
them he said he regarded them lust the j
same as the moose â to be killed and
eaten. Then suddenly turning to other j
Indians near by he said:
"If you don't kill me to-night I will |
kill you."
The other Indians became terribly j
afraid of the devil-possessed man. and j
two of them, catching him unawares, j
sprang on him from behind. They held j
him secure while a third Indian took a j
hatchet and smashed in his skull. These
three then dragged the murdered man ;
to a hut, bound him to the floor with
stakes and cut off his heau. Beine still
afraid that he might come at them, for
they had a great fear of the person
j,, ssessed of an evil spirit, they fast
ened the door and fled. After a lapse j
of two days they returned and buried |
MOORE IN JAIL
AT NEVADA CITY
Back at the Scene of His
Crime.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEVADA Cltl\ April 28.âTrem
bling from weakness, shivering from
cold, his features wan and pinched, his
hat rim slouched down over his rest
less, piercing eyes, and his body
swathed in ;i red buggy robe to keep
out the nipping mountain air, the
manacled midnight assassin, who with
out warning shot to death Policeman
Kilroy twenty-six days ago, presented
an uncanny and grewsome ppectacle as
he was lifted out of a carriage at the
Nevada County Coiartliocse shortly be
fore 5 o'clock this morning. Supported
on one side by Sheriff Getchell and on
the other by Sheriff Veale of Contra
Costa, with Captain Nihell bringing up
the rear, Murderer Moore began the
ascent of the stairs to the jail floor of
the temple of justice. It seemed a
veritable death march and the gray,
shadowy dawn light accentuated its
wierdness. The prisoner was half led
and half carried, for his knees at times
collapsed like thofee of a craven death
convict advancing to take his place un
der the yawning noose that dangles for
his kind.
Once in the barred ante-room of the
jail the prisoner sank into a chair the
moment- that the blanket was unrolled
from around him and the handcuffs
were unlocked. He took the situation
with the stolidity of an Apache, except
for the furtive glances he cast around
and an almost imperceptible twitching
of the mouth. Then the heavy double
doors to murderers' alley swung back
and the new arrival went in, moving
painfully and as if he left all hope be
hind. He was assigned to one of the
steel tanks and no sooner had he en
tered it than he flung himself on the
cot and in five minutes was sound
asleep. He was awakened at 9 o'clock
for breakfast, which he ate voraciously.
This afternoon Moore was taken by
District Attorney Powers' order before
Justice Coghlan, who set the prelimi
nary examination for 10 o'clock Friday
morning. As he passed to and from
the court room through the busiest
streets of the city, with Sheriffs Get
chell and Veale, the only officers in
Charge, a thousand people quickly con
gregated along the route or followed
the trio. But there was no breach of
the peace, no disposition shown to
create any disturbance.
At every station on the railroad from
Martinez to Colfax the train was be
sieged by hundreds of people seeking
a sight of the bad man of Little Deer
Creek. In the drive from Colfax the
party saw only two men, and that was
after their arrival at this city. When
the vehicle was passing the corner of
Broad and Pine streets where the mur
der was committed, Moore straightened
up in his seat, gave a quick glance to
ward the spot where Kilroy was killed,
and with a perceptible shudder sank
back again.
At the depot in Sacramento a hand
some bouquet was handed to Moore by
a man. A card accompanied it, bearing
the following: '
"I've modest violets and rosei bloom
ing. Love and good wishes."
On the other side of the card was the
name "Jennie Campbell, 1617 N." The
name was printed in type and the rest
was written. Moore says Jennie Camp
bell is an old friend of his.
Moore preserves an imperturbable si
lence, not having spoken a word since
his arrival here, except to say "yes" or
"no" to the officers. At Colfax this
morning he told a newspaper man that
Kilroy struck him on the head with a
club, and then he shot. He also said
that Tred Eilerman and Larry Mullen,
as well as "Bob" Gates, saw the blow
and the killing. Eilerman and Mullen
deny this pointblank.
Sheriff Getchell to-day issued orders
that no flowers be taken to Moore's
cell, and that even the reporters sha'l
not see him till he regains his strength.
To-day the point was raised that
Sheriff Veale is not entitled to the $1300
prize money offered for Moore, but that
it should go to Farmer James Ken
nerly of McAvoy, Contra Costa County.
who* put the Sheriff on the trail. This
contention is based on an alleged ruling
of the Supreme Court in the Weber
niurdor case of San Josp. Chief Lees
caught the murderer, hut the man who
posted the Chief put in a claim for the
money, and finally got it. on the grround
that the officer was amply compensated
by his salary.

the body. They then went to the camD
to kill another Indian, probably to ap
pease the great spirit.
In the meantime one of the Indians
had carried word fifty miles to the
mounted police post at Lesser Slave
Lake, and Corporal Charles Phillins
and Constable Warren started for the
scene of the tragedy. Those at the
post regarded the two mounted police
men as heroes, for all were of the opin
ion that the two brave riders of the
plains would fall a sacrifice to the fury
of the Indans, who had grown blood
thirsty. Traveling night and day tin
police got to the camp early in the
morning:, before it was awake. They
demanded the surrender of the murder
ers, and enforced their demand with re
volvers.
The Indians refused to speak, but one
of the women pointed out the two
murderers, or executioners. and
a third who had assisted them
in the deed. Then, while Con
stable Warren held them at the point
of his revolver, Corporal Phillips hand
cuffed two Indians, named Napecdcis
and Paillew, and took away a third,
named Chac-Ca-Chac, as a witness.
Napecocis is the one who cut off Loul
son's head. The report that cannibal
ism was actually practiced turned out
to be untrue.
The police returned to the post with
their prisoners, and with an inter
preter set out for Edmonton on April
5. They had four horse:: and a big sled,
the prisoners being chained to it.
Grf-at praise is given to Corporal

ROYAL WELCOME
TO THE RALEIGH
Arrival of the Cruiser at
Philadelphia.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, , April 25.â The
cruiser Raleigh, which is to take part
in the ceremonies incident to the un
veiling of the Grant monument in Fair
mount Park on Thursday, reached her
anchorage off Race street wharf to
day. Mayor Ashbridge, the Council
committee on the unveiling, and a
number of distinguished citizens, met
the warship below the city and. es
corted her to the anchorage. A large
fleet of steamers followed in her wake,
blowing whistles constantly, to which
noise was added the welcome from fac
tory bells and whistles on both sides of
the Delaware River. '
When the procession reached the
League Island Navy-yard the Raleigh
fired a salute of fifteen guns for Ad
miral Casey, commandant of the yard,
to which the navy-yard responded. A
brief stop was made, during which the
Raleigh's commander went ashore and
paid his respects to Admiral Casey and
Captain Clarke, the captain of the
yard. '.
The President and party will arrive
to-morrow morning. Following the un
veiling the President will attend a ban
quet at the Union League and later in
the evening will attend a public meet-
Ing at the Academy of Music. He will
make no speeches.
The military display to-morrow will
consist of the National Guard of Penn
sylvania, crew of the Raleigh, marines
and sailors from League Island, several
New Jersey regiments and a number of
private military organizations. On
Friday there will be a demonstration
on the river, when President McKinley,
in honor of the Raleigh and her crew,
will pay a visit to Captain Coghlan.
Mrs. Grant arrived here shortly after
7 o'clock. She was accompanied by
Miss Rosemayer Sartoris, who is her
granddaughter, and who will unveil the
statue, and Miss Coffey. They were
met at the station of the Pennsylvania
Railway by a ladies' committee, of
which Mrs. Charles Harrison, wife of
the provost of Pennsylvania, is chair
man.
Soon after Mayor Ashbridge and the
Council committee boarded the Raleigh
to-day, while the gallant little vessel
was on her way up the river, the Mayor
and committee went into Captain
Coghlan's cabin, where the captain, the
officers and the crew were formally
welcomed to Philadelphia by the
Mayor. In responding Captain Cogh
lan said:
"Mr. Mayor and members of the com
mittee: We appreciate the spirit in
which you greet us, and thank you for
it. I do not personally need to be told
of the kindness of the people of this
city, for I lived here several years, and
remember their kindness. The invita
tion to take part in the unveiling of the
Grant statue is gratifying, and as to
the celebration of Dewey day, we will
regard that as a privilege, for we feel
that we are almost a part of Dewey. As
to the invitation to dine to-night with
the committee, we accent that â not be
cause we want the dinner, but because
we want to be with you."
Captain Coghlan and all his officers
came ashore shortly after 6 o'clock.
The commander of the Raleigh was
driven to the Stratford Hotel, where
he greeted his wife, and he shortly
afterward went to the Hotel Walton,
where they were tendered a dinner by
the â¢ Council committee. The entire
party later on attended a theater.

DREYFUS CASE
CAUSES FIGHTS
Rival Meetings Followed
by Encounters.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS. April 28.â The advocates and
opponents of Dreyfus revision h-Md
rival meetings in Paris this evening
and fights occurred afterward in the
streets. Several persons were injured.
The Figaro's publication of the evi
dence of Captain Cuignet before the
Court of Cassation has thrown th*Â»
anti-revision party into consternation.
The Eclaire and all the anti-Dreyfus
j papers are boiling with indignation.
! Several of them suppress altogether the
! testimony of this officer, whose princi
! pal statement was that the guilt or
I Dreyfus could be only inferential^
i shown from the secret dossier. The
Eclaire denounces Captain Cuignet
in unmeasured terms.
It is rumored that a daughter of one
of the members of the Cabinet, desiring
to put an end to the scandal, gave the
Figaro, gratis, the reports of the evi
dence before the Court of Cassation
The Figaro begins to-day the evi
dence offered before the united cham
bers of the court.
M Palelogue, one of the permanent
officials of the Foreign Office, in the

the cipher telegrams, expressed the
â¢ conviction that the document contained
in the secret dossier purporting to be
a telegram from a foreign agent to his
government indicating the relations of
Dreyfus with Germany and which cap
tain Cuignet had cited as proving guilt,
was a forgery.

It is only during recent years that advanced
scientists have begun to realize the wonderful
and all-important influence of the nervous sys-
tem over all the organs and parts that serve
to make up the human body. It is safe to
say that two-thirds the population suffer from
nervous disorder to a greater or less extent.
The housewife, whose mind is preoccupied all
the day long- with tier various household duties,
is just as likely to suffer from nervous dis-
order as is the woman who has no more to do
than think of her ills. .
The laboring man, the merchant, the profes-
sional man is not exempt from nervous disease,
any more than is the man who is at leisure.
The symptoms that warn you of impending
Nervous Prostration are Headache (Fig. 1) â

Weakness In Back (Fig . Weakness in
Limbs (Fig. 6). Other symptoms are tremblings,
vertigo or dizzy spells, sleeplessness, costive-
ness, despondency, melancholia, irritable tem-
per and that tired and worn-out feeling. You
are unable to apply yourself to work. Your
mind is not clear. You have evil forebodings.
All these are indications of a general letting-
down of your nervous system.
Do not permit yourself to go on to complete
breaking down. Hudyan will cure you. Hud-
yan will ward off nervous prostration. Hudyan
will cure nervous prostration if your disease
has progressed that far.

menstruation, mucous discharges, are very
often the result of a weakness of the uterine
and ovarian nerves. Hudyan will cure you.
Men who suffer from nervous weakness will
find in Hudyan a remedy that strengthens and
invigorates the entire organism.
A weakness of the nerve centers of the brain
is the chief cause of headaches and dizziness.
Hudyan will cure.
A weakness of the nerves of the stomach will
produce indigestion, dyspepsia, etc. Hudyan
will cure.
A weakness of the nerves of the lungs will
create weak lungs, oftentimes leading the pa-
tient to believe that consumption exists. Hud-
yan will cure.
Weakness of the nerves of the bowels will

JOIhAMBANCISCO iWORK IS BEGUN
ON THE HARBOR
AT SAN PEDRO
Vast Throng Gathers to Cele
brate the People's
Victory.
LOS ANGELES. April 26.â As the mariners of old wedded the
Adriatic to Venice with the ceremony of a golden ring, so was
Southern California to-day cemented in commercial union with
the Pacific when President McKinley. in the White House at 11
o cock this morning, touched the electric button that caused the
first barge load of rock to be dumped in the actual construction of
â .m Pedro Harbor breakwater.
Fully 20,000 persons attended the first
Â«!,-,ys celebration of the Free Harbor Ju
hllee ai San Pedro. Amid the booming of
m:i anil the shouts of the assembled
!n si the 700 tons of rock slid Into the
.l.i.id waters of the harbor from a barge
the point designated by the Govern
ment engineers In charge of Captain .1. J.
M.yler. To-night at San Pedro the fes
tivities w.re continued with a water car
nival, including a pyrotechnleal display
<^Â°iat has had no equal in Southern Call
irnia. The people feasted at a barbecue,
;.t which were consumed the cooked meat
>f forty-three steers, three tons of baked
lieans, 500 pounds of coffee and 22.000 buns.
This was the biggest barbecue ever given
iJ) the history of the State.
The literary part of the program] was
not (he Last interesting feature of the
day. This celebration has been the means
nf assembling a number of noted Califor
nians. including Senator Stephen M.
"\Vhit<\ Senator George C. Perkins, Mayor
James I>. Phelan. Attorney General Tirey
J.. Ford, Judge J. G. Maguin . Governor
Henry T. Gage. Captain J. J. Meyler,
Colonel G. H. Mendell, Senator Boyce
;ii!.l representatives from every section
*>f Southern California. At various stages
of the day's exercises these gentlemen
spoke upon the absorbing topic of the
celebration. In reviewing the battle for
the harbor and detailing the victory of
ib>- people over the combined interests
of corporate power the highest honors
vere awarded to Senator White for his
zeal, ability and skill in outwitting the
attempt tn thwart the will of the masses.
The name of Thomas F. Gibbon, vice
president of the Los Angeles Terminal
Kailway, was frequently mentioned as the
leading local spirit in this contest, and
tv him just credit was given.
Governor Henry T. Gage, whose name
was added to the list of speakers at the
last moment, was the first to be intro
duced to the throng. He greeted his fel
low citizens in set phrases and congratu
lated them up..n the success of their ef
lorts for a free harbor at San Pedro,
BDOke of the joy he felt In being permitted
\^-<> participate in the jubilee and declared
ihe harbor would pen to Southern Cali
fornia the commerce of the Pacific, includ
ing the Philippines, where he hoped the
American flag would ever float. In the
course nf his remarks the Governor said:
Senator White, who ha* retired, as he says
jrom public life, has been, in my Judgment,
i. It hough I differ with him politically, an ideal
Senator. He has never, when working in be
lialf of the people, required as a stimulus to
Ms grand action any newspaper edict, nor has
he ever required ihe balm to his conscience of
a legislative resolution. Always has he been
guid*d by nne rule, and that was. in my judg
ment, 1 say, whenever an act met the approval
vi his conscience he let results take care of
themselves. And;- no man is better loved in
California to-day than the gentleman whom I
Just greeted lu'ie as he has retired from public
life.
This statement has put the friends of
Senator Perkins in a serious mood, and
tney are to-night questioning the propri
ety of the Governor's language at a gath
ering such as he addressed. This was the
lirst time Perkins and Gage have met
since the Senator criticized Gage for his
numerous pocket vetoes. The statement
Is made by the admirers of Perkins that
Gage has taken the first opportunity to
rebuke the Senator from the north.
Ex-Senator Stephen -M. White said in
part:
Day by day we can see improvements in our
State, and we are constantly aspiring to an
' end that will make this, the Golden State of the
West, the greatest one in the union.
Man desire is to improve. We have looked
forward to the commencement of work on this
liarbnr for years, and now we have the realiza
tion cif our expectations.
As in the case of the harbor, so is it always
that the man who aspires to truth and Justke
. vill win. while he who aspires against truth
L md justice Is sure to lose.
%- In this case, which has led up to the com
mencement of the work on this harbor, how
ever, there has been little in individualities.
It Is the aggregate work of the people of the
State which has counted. The work of the
people did more than that of any representative
or more than the work of all your representa
tives combined. I do not take to myself the
credit which my friend, the Governor, has
piven me, but in all my connection with the
Tight for this harbor I have dona the best I
could.
The Senator then entered into a brief
history of the fight which has led up to
the commencement of work on the liar
hor. He told of the untiring efforts of
Peveral citizens of Southern California in
their work toward the harbor, and
added:
It is sufficient to say, as we meet here to-day
to celebrate the inning of work on this
harbor, that it is our duty to thank God that
we. have won.
Let us all put our shoulders to the wheel
and work for the betterment of our town, our
county and our race. Let us stand loyal to the
Interests which have been placed in our. charge,
â whether such a stand brings us sorrow or hap
piness.
Throughout his remarks, the ex-Sena
tor frequently referred In complimentary
t>rms to those who assisted in the battle
fur the people. He was particularly warm
in his praises of Senator Perkins, who, he
t-ald, had been an ardent friend of the
Han Pedro harbor.
Senator Perkins in his address said that
the booming of cannon Indicated that the
J 'resident of the United States had given
his official sanction to the work under
taken at San Pedro harbor and the words
of our honored Governor voiced the senti
ments of the people. Said. he:
U"e have had the support and co-operation of
every member of the California delegation in
â¢ "ongrepu except one, and all those from the
â¢ 'cast States, because they believed it was an
enterprise in the interest of the people and of
commerce. That breakwater will be built, and
if our representatives do their duty that inner
I rbor will be dredged out. When the Xl'-ii-
A :uan canal is completed, as It will be, you
ofill get competition In transportation.' The
mi I road projected from Utah to Los Angeles
will be built, and before ten years have passed
you will have two more transcontinental lines.
I Â«m opposed to annexation of foreign countriea
Lwhen they bring to us a heterogeneous popula
tion that has no sympathy with our institu
tions. . . .
Judge Maguire followed, saying:
The, splendid success achieved by the people
cf Southern California in their battle for a free
harbor at Pan Pedro can be looked upon as an
example of wonderful persistence. The Cali-
Tornians of the north take pleasure In attesting
their gratification over the result, as the pros
perity of the State is linked with the progress
ami development of every section of the com
monwealth.
Judge Maguire paid a high tribute to
the efforts of Senator White and then re
called the struggles in Congress.
"In calling up the warhorses who strove

he, "forget that you owe much to the
tireless energy of Cooper of Wisconsin
who was as faithful as any Californian."
Mayon Phelan, who was hi excellent
voice, said ho fell as deep interest in the
development of a free harbor on the south
coast aa did the people of I.os Angeles
and he rejoiced that they had gained a
victory over the corporate power repre
sented in the domination of a great rail
road system.
"But," continued Mayor Phelan, "do not
be lulled into a sense of security. Have
men to govern San Pedro who will protect
your wharf rights, so that these rights
will not be absorbed by those who ure
more anxious to benefit by such privi
leges. We in San Francisco transferred
our lights to itoe State, and I can say
tn you that our next municipal campaign
will tie fought out on the issue whether
or not we shall control the situation and
be free to maintain our affairs without
the intervention of others."
Attorney General Ford, who spoke 4n
behalf of Northern California, said no
rivalry existed between San Francisco
and San Pedro and the commercial In
ts in building a greater empire on
tin' Pacific < 'oast were actuated by gen
erous Impulses.
HOWARD HEARING IS
- SUDDENLY ENDEH
SAN JOBE, April 2<i.â The examination
into the connection of E. B. Howard, tin
fruit shipper, with the failure of the
Union Savings Bank, commenced before

moming. It came up on the petition of
J. M. ("ox to hn\e (240,000 of indebtedness
claimed by the batik against Howard set
aside on the ground that the bank had
wiped out the indebtedness in an agree
ment with Howard. Attorney Morehouae
appeared for <"ox, and he was just begin
ning to Kt-t some interesting matter from
Howard when Jackson Hatch, attorney
lor the Union Savings Hani:, appeared
and questioned Coulter's authority to go
I into an examination of the facts. He filed
an answer alleging that the referee had
no right to set a day for the hearing and
take testimony, and he asked that the
n be sei aside. The referee denied
this motion, but agreed to certify to his
B< tion and send the question to Judge
De Haven for a decision. This terminated
the hearing for a time.
A couple of years ago Howard became
financially embarrassed and notified the
bank that he intended to go into insol
vency. He owed the institution over $-â â¦â >.

indebtedness with the bank was incurred
by Howard.
RAIN SAVES CROPS
IN MONTEREY COUNTY
KING CITY. April 2fi.â The rain of the
past few days has been of almost inesti
mable value t.. the people <~>f this section.
Rain fell in all parts of the valley, and
never was the precipitation more oppor
tune. Crops in many places had begun to
fail badly and the grass-covered hills
were turning brown. The rain has put new
life into grain and will greatly Improve
the yield. Many farmers had given up
hope of getting anywhere near a good
crop, but this rain assures them of at
least a. fair yield. It is safe to, estimate
that the last rain was worth hundreds of
thousands of dollars to Salinas Valley
farmers. Beets planted on irrigated lands
>:re Hi gplendid condition, and there is no
fear of a failure of the sugar beet crop
in this section.
VKNTI/RA. April 2..âTh e rainfall was
.45 of an im-h during the last twenty-four
hours throughout Ventura County, it was
nearly an inch at Nordhoff. The down
pour is of great value to the, barley crop.

the biggest hay crops in the history of
this valley is assured. Some hay is being
cut. The storm has passed.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1899.
NATIVE SONS FETED AT
HISTORIC MONTEREY
SALINAS, April of the Golden West,
of. "all play" for the ,Grand Parlor
of Native Sons of the Golden West,
vj its chief, event being the trip to
Monterey, Del Monte and Pacific
Grove. The only work of the day
was an evening session of the Grand Par
lor, which was shortly given over to the
California Argonauts for their annual
"warm time." as they call an initiation. .
This "warm time" was really the event
of the day from a hilarious standpoint,
for although the initiation, presided over
by Camp No. 4 of California Argonauts,
was, not foolish and rough and really pos
sessed ritualistic merit, it was more in
the nature- of a big lark than anything
else.
No play day could have opened with
brighter prospects, and no more perfect
day for the events of the i.xonterey pro
gramme could have been found. The
journey over to Monterey, through green
fields of grain and grass and between
hills, the sides of which were completely
covered by gorgeous carpets of yellow
and blue blossoms with their background
of green foliage, the final debarkation In
the sweet salt air of Monterey Bay, the
blue of the waters of the bay and the
deep boom of its surf, the diverse and
beautiful scenery of the famous cypress
drive, the well-kept gardens of Hotel del
Monte, and finally the return to Salinas
when twilight was merging into moon
lightâall combined to make a panorama
of beauty of the outside world that those
among the Native Sons who have an ar
tistic strain in their make-up will never
forget.
Of course this trip was notable in other
respects as well as that of its beauty,
and was one of unusual significance and
importance to the order. Since so much
of the secret ritual of the organization
relates to the town and county of Monte
rey, its people, places and events of early
daysâ the order having been built upon
the foundation laid by the early history
of the commonwealth of California, and
that before it became a commonwealth, a
great part of which was made in and
about old Montereyâ the place was con
sidered with more than usual interest.
Many of the delegates, to-day visited
Monterey for the first time, and all eyes
and ears were wide open and every brain
was thirsty for the information the cor
dial entertainers were delighted to give.
Especial interest was shown in the old
custom-house, over which Commodore
Sloat raised the first American flag ever
flung to the California breezes; Colton
Hah, in which sat the convention that
drafted and signed the constitution of the
State of California, and Fort Halleck," on
the Government reservation, where fig
ured in bygone days Ord, Eialleck, Stev
enson, Fremont and other soldier heroes
of the nation.
The splendid domains of the Pacific
Improvement Company, Hotel del Monte
and the seventeen-mile drive, came in for
their share of attention, but with a lesser
degree of interest than that occasioned
by the historic old Spanish capital.
The story of General Shermans little
sweetheart and th. rose tree that Ger
trude Atherton's "La Tulita" has made
so celebrated was retold many times dur
ing the day.
The natives, 500 of them,, left here at 9
o'clock this morning by special train, ac
companied by the Fifth Regiment Band
of San Jose. The journey to the old cap
ital was chiefly notable for . the large
amount of electioneering that was ac
complished by the various candidates for
grand offices, or their managers. The
Byington-Hawkins contest occasioned
much animated talk, and all' the. two
score candidates for grand trusteeships
were discussed with the utmost freedom,
regardless of their presence.
It is now nearly certain that Frank (or
"Pop," as he is called, because he is the
oldest member of the order) Sabichi will
ixdless of their presence.
is now nearly certain that Frank (or
p," as lie is called, because he is the
st member of the order) Sabichi will
have the test of the light with D. W.
Edelman of Los Angeles. McLaughlin of
Quincy Parlor, San Francisco, has re
tired in favor of C. D. Dunbar of Santa
Rosa, whom he will nominate when the
time conies. A new candidate for a grand
trusteeship has arisen in the person of
Saul Magner of Bay City Parlor, San
Francisco. His chances seem to.be
slightly dubious now, but may brighten
later. Some other recently announced can
didates for grand trusteeships are Edward
McCabe of Watsonville and Rod W.
Church and Barnett of Alameda. Judge
Dooling of Hollister is one of the few who
are considered almost certain winners.
Arriving at Monterey, the Natives were
met by a reception committee headed by
Mayor R. F. Johnson the Natives were
by a reception committee headed by
or R. F. Johnson and consisting of
Harry R. Greene, A. Gunzendorfer, A.
Westfall, F. M. Hilby, J. Lachman, Ed
ward Ingram and Charles R. Few.
Headed by the Monterey City band, the
delegates and their entertainers were es
corted through the streets of the old
town to Bagley's Opera-house. The
streets were bright with Native Sons'
colors and red, white and blue bunting,
':>right with Native Sons'
and red. white and blue bunting.
while many busines houses, as well as
private residences', were handsomely dec
orated with a profusion of lovely flowers.
Flags flew from every pole, and pennants,
among which the Bear flag showed promi
nently. fluttered everywhere. In its march
the body traversed two Presidential
streets Washington and Tyler), one Em
bassadorial (Franklin) and one guberna
torial (Alvarado), and as each street's
name was discovered the man for whom
it was named was heartily cheered.
Reaching the , opera-house, Harry
R. Greene, chairman of the committee
on arrangements, , and the man to whom
Greene, chairman of the committee
irrangements, and the man to whom
to-day's success was largely due, mount
ed the balcony in front of the building,
accompanied by Mayor Johnson. The
Fifth Regiment band played an inspiring
introductory and then Mr. Greene intro
duced the Mayor with a few appropriate
words. Mayor Johnson, who is himself
a Native Son, formally welcomed the
Grand Parlor to Monterey and tendered
the freedom of the city to its members
and their friends. Mayor Johnson said:
Ladies and Gentlemen, Visiting .Native Sons
and I laughters: In the name of the city of
Monterey I extend to you the freedom of our
city and a most hearty welcome. We trust that
during your short stay you will enjoy your
selves. If there Is anything you see you want
don't ask for it; take It, for all Montereyans
feel you have good and sufficient claims to
our town. It was within a stone's throw of
this hall where the old pioneers convened the
first Legislature and framed the. first consti
tution, that to-day stands unchallenged and
recognize,] as one of the ablest papers In the
union. So go ahead and have a time as though
you owned the place. Between the hours if 11
a. m. and 2 r>. m. luncheon will be served Jn
this hall, and I hope you will all come and do
it justice/. â  â¢'
The speech was greeted with three rous
ing cheers from the natives for their en
tertainers and for old Monterey, and after
pome very entertaining responses from
several of the natives the party entered
waiting vehicles to be driven through Pa
cific Grove and around the Cypress drive.
Every coach, drag, carriage and trap â
indeed, every available thing on wheels,
except a "wheel," from Monterey; Del
Monte and Pacific Groveâ was called into
requisition to : accommodate the city's
guests, for there were, besides nearly 500
natives, almost half as many, ladies and
friends. A quick trip was made over sev
enteen miles of good road, no time being
allowed for loitering on the beaches to
piPk up pebbles or sea moss, for there
were many things to do and very limited
time allowed in which to do them.
On their return to Monterey, the party
repaired immediately to the opera-house
for luncheon. There it was received by
the following ladies with charming hos
pitality: Mesdames L. B. Josselyn. H. A.
Grene. F. M. Hilby, C. Tibbetts, W. Kil
patrick, M. Harris, . M. W. Wolter, C. R.
Few, J. A. Wolter, J. Harris, W. C.
Brown, J. L. D. Roberts, J. F. Moore, O.
F. Greely, W. W. James;- the Misses
Clark. Matilda and Amelia Bergschicker,
Crelbagby, Rose Harris, Hattie Bellamy,
Lottie Michaelis, Mamie Wolter. M. Pat
terson, Abbie and Mollle Whiteomb.
The luncheon menu was extremely
unique, being in every respect typical of
Monterey, both past and present. It con
sisted of abalone chowder, baked mussels
in shells, abalone esada, enchiladas, bapas
conchlli, tamales, mussel salad, empana
das and other dishes of Spanish cookery,'
completed by genuine Mexican dulces and
chocolate.
Out of compliment to the "natives the
tables were decorated almost entirely with
the California poppy (eschscholtzia) and
other Monterey wild flowers and ferns,
and certainly no more beautiful adorn
ment could have been found. When the
natives saw this they cheered , for the
loyal Monterey ladies. Various toasts
and speeches caused the time to pass rap
idly and the delegates were late getting
away from the table. â¢
, Going- to Colton Hall. California's first
capitol building, the delegates viewed the
dipapidated old building and inspected Its
rooms, and while assembled in the room

NATIVES OF SACRAMENTO WILL
HOLD FORTH ON DEWEY DAY
MISS EDNA JOHNSON, President of Califia
Parlor No. 22, Native Daughters of the
Golden West.
SACRAMENTO, April 2H.âSacra
mento is all expectation over the
Dewey jubilee fete and floral car
nival, which will take place here
next Monday. The press of the
city and citizens in general are do
ing everything possible to promote
the sue, -ess of the event. The business
houses all will close, as well as all State,
county and city offices. The day is to be
given up entirely to the Native Sons and
Daughters.
Last evening closed the balloting for
May Queen, and the selection of Miss
Lottie Petrie to act in that capacity is a
popular one. She is the daughter of
William Petrie, a prominent business man
of this city. She was born and reared hi
Sacramento and is a member of Califla
Parlor No. 22, N. D. G. W. Miss Petrie
was busy to-day receiving the congratu
lations of her mam- friends and admirers.
Miss Petrie is an atractive demi-blonde
and of stately, carriage and good figure.
constitution of the State, of California I
they were told something of the history
of the placeâ how Alcalde Walter Colton
bought the foundation from a company
of Mormons who had designed it for a ]
Mormon temple; how he completed the ;
building and presented it to the city of j
Monterey for a municipal ball, and how. '
after it had fallen into disuse and decay,
Monterey citizens made strenuous efforts
to raise funds for its preservation, even
getting bills through both houses of the j
State Legislature at two different ses
sions, only to have them vetoed by Gov
ernors Markham and Gage.
H. A. Greene, who is especially enthusi
astic over the preservation of this most i
interesting monument to California pio
neers, told the story, and told it so well
that when he was through an impromptu
indignation meeting was held and the
natives resolved to bring the matter up
in the present Grand Parlor session and
see what could be done to relieve the
State of the disgrace of allowing Colton
Hall to bee,, me a rulil.
Twenty years ago Jules Tavernier, Jo
seph Strong, Yon Perbandt. Biers tad t,
Charles Rollo Peters and other artists*
who have since become famous made
Monterey their headquarters for sketch-
Ing and painting, and the Bohemian sa
loon, kept at that time by Sanchez Broth
ers, was their favorite resort. Here, in !
company with Robert Louis Stevenson,
Charles Warren Stoddanl. Daniel O'Con
nell and Bret Harte, they held their social
reunions. At odd times the artists dec
orated the walls, bar panels, doors, etc..
with paintings of rare beauty. Many of
them remain, and having been carefully
preserved are viewed and admired by vis
itors from all parts of the world.
This resort the Natives found especially
interesting, for many, of the men who
frequented it in limes past were com- I
rades and brother Natives of those who |
invaded it to-day.
After trudging up the hill to Fort Hal
lock and about town to other points of !
note, everybody went to the Del Monte I
Baths and enjoyed a refreshing plunge In I
the tanks or the surf. They then boarded
the train for the return to Salinas and
left Monterey as they had entered it,
cheering like mad for the birthplace of
California Statehood, its people and their
royal entertainment of to-day, and for
the Native Sons of the Golden West.-
Although a great amount of the Native
Sons' work has been done thus far dur
ing the week, a far greater amount must
yet be accomplished before the Grand
Parlor can adjourn. It is true the pro
gramme work has been virtually mapped
out until 1901 by the appointment of Santa
Cruz as the admission day celebration and
Oroville as the next place for the Grand
Parlor to meet, but the election of grand
officers has yet to occur. That will be
done to-morrow. There is. it is asserted
by those who profess to know, virtually
no contest for any of the offices except
those of grand orator and grand trus
tee.
It has been the custom ta give the en
tertaining parlor a trustee, but Zabala of
9be has blue eyes and a most amiable
manner.
Her costume was chosen this afternoon
and is to be a "perfect dream" of
Duchesse white satin, trimmed with
jewels, cut en train.
The Native Daughters are taking a
very prominent part in the arrangements
for the celebration. The following mem
bers of Califla Parlor are on the general
committee: Mrs. Emma Gett, Miss Edna
Johnson, Mlss Mary Woods, Miss Ella
McCleary. Mrs. Eva Nickell, Miss Hertie
Groth, Miss Mollie Johnson, Miss Jennie
Fay, Miss Belle Johnson, Miss lnie Gillis
ana Miss Ida Curtis.
Of these Mrs. Gett is assistant director
general. Miss Mollie Johnson Is secre
tary of the joint committee, ably assisted
by Miss lnie Gillis. Miss Edna Johnson
is president of Califia Parlor, and tilled
the position of chairman of the voting
contest committee. Miss Gillis is chair
man of the Maypole dance. Miss Groth
has charge of the special attractions.
Califla Parlor is a particularly favored
organization in Sacramento, and the fact
the local organization, on whom the'se
lection would fall, has waived l this privi
lege, an act which ft supposed to
strengthen the candidacy "of judge Pool
ing. To-morrow all grand officers will be
elected.
The parade which was to have taken
place on Tuesday will occurMn the morn
ing at 10 o'clock. Sheriff Farley of Mon
terey County has been chosen marshal of
the parade. His aids will be S. N.
Ma the w, F. ML Vierra, A. J. Zabala. F.
J. Griffin. J. O. Boronda and E. Alzina.
Ten thousand people are expected to be
in this city. Excursions will be run from
Monterey," Del Monte, Pacific Grove. Hol
lister. WatSOnviUe and Santa Cruz. All
fraternal and civic societies of this city,
aa well as several from other places, will
be present. There will be between twenty
and thirty floats in the parade. Eleven
hundred school children will be in line.
the girls all dressed in white, while
the boys will wear black uniforms.
Schools in the outlying districts will
parade, in the afternoon there will be a]
baseball game between the league teams
Of Santa Cruz and Watsonyille. The
Grand Parlor will hold sessions in the
morning and afternoon and at night all
delegates will be tendered a banquet by
Santa Lucia Parlor of Native Sons and
Aleli Parlor of Native Daughters at
Armory Hall.
The Argonauts, the Curly Bears and
the Crematories, all three in one and
about 100 in all. held sway in this
to-night after 10 o'clock. The meeting
proper was supposed lo be under the ,
auspices Of California Camp No. 4 of
Argonauts, but as a matter of fact all
three factions of the famous initiatory
degree teams from the Curly Bears helped
wonderfully to make life enjoyable, and
yet at times miserable for the numerous; |
Native Sons who were eligible to partake
of and undergo the hidden mysteries of
ritualistic work. The meeting itself took
place in Native Sons' Hall, and naturally
was strictly exclusive except to Argo
nauts. . .
\ large banner was stretched across
Main street this afternoon announcing
that the yearly meeting of the celebrated
order would occur to-night, during which
time there would be lively times for the
degree teams and after which the annual
banquet would occupy the balance of the
night.
E. H. Folsom. manager of the Argo
nauts' degree team, had his men at work
early in the evening so as to have every
feature go off like clockwork.
W. D. Hobro Jr., the casarcasimotor of
the Argonauts, arrived on this evening's
train in order to properly attend to the
ceremonies which commenced after the
Grand Parlor session had closed.
The initiatory team is composed of the
following brothers: I. A. Bernard, O. L.
Blackmail, James P. Dockery. Al Davis, ]
E. H. Folsom, Eugene Gauthier Jr., I

that so many of its prominent members
are interested in the Dewey day festival
has in a great measure brought about the
unqualified success of the celebration that
is now assured. The committees assigned
to the Native Daughters are important
ones, and they are working unceasingly
from morning until night in preparations
incident to stich an undertaking.
The joint committee met this evening,
at which time final arrangements were
made. To-morrow one of the most at
tractive programmes ever arranged in
this section of the State will be an
nounced. Now that interest is so great
many additional attractions are being
added to the original plans of the commit
tee.
Of the Native Sons of the general com
mittee it can be said they are all promi
nent in the order. J. T. Skelton Jr. past
president of Sunset Parlor, is chairman-
C. I). Crowell of Sacramento Parlor vice
chairman; County Auditor Rich T Cohn
is director general, and as such is in
charge of all matters pertaining to the
concessions at the park.

John T. Greany announced the receipt or

DR. VANCE DENOUNCES
AWFUL MOB VIOLENCE
Declares That the Lynching Horror
at Newnan Was a Disgrace
to the South.
ATLANTA, Ga.\ April 25.-At the ninth
International (fourteenth national) Sun
day School Congress to-night there was
a reference to. the Newnan affair. Dr.
Vance of Nashville, who spoke for* the
South in response to welcoming ad
dresses, said:
As I stand here to-night, a Southerner, speak
ing for my section and addressing an audience
trom all sections, there is one foul blot upun
the fair name of the South, at the bare mention
pi which the heart turns sick and the cheek
is crimsoned with shame. I want to lift my
voice to-night in loud and long indignant pro
test ugainst the awful horror of mob violence
which the other day reached the climax of Its
madness and Infamy in a deed as black and
brutal and barbarous as -can be found in all
the annals of human crime.
I have a right to speak on this subject and I
propose to be heard. The time has come for
every lover of the South to set the might of an
angered and resolute manhood against the
Shame ana peril of the lynch t'emon These
people whose fiendish glee taunts their victim
as his flesh crackles in the flames do not repre
sent the Southâ they slander the South I have
not a fit apology for the sickening actions For
one I dare to believe the people of mv section
are able to cope with them, however treacher
ous and defiant, through the courts of justice
and I plead for the masterful sway of a.
righteous and exalted public "Sentiment that
shall class lynch law in the category with the
crime.

conference at The Ha^ue, were inter

"It is by no means a foregone conclu
sion that we will advocate universal
peace," said N. Ariga. "It seems that we
are living in martial times. Great issues

afterward embarrass himself. "
STALE EGGS FOR
ERRING PASTOR
Dunkards Drive Out an
Offender.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
POMONA, April 26.â Another chapter
in the scandal in the Dunkard colony
at Lordsburg developed last night.
Three weeks ago Celia Overholtzer, the
handsome, blue-eyed daughter of S. A.
Overholtzer, arose in a crowded meet
ing at the Dunkard church at Lords
burg and openly confessed her intimacy
of several years' standing with Rev. E.
A. Miller, pastor of the church and
head of the Dunkard College at Lords
bur.;;. Rev. Mr. Miller denied the ac
cusations and called for an immediate
trial. When the vote upon his case
was taken he was found guilty by 97
per cent of the ballots cast. He was
thereupon expelled and the next day
he and his family removed to Los An
geles. The Dunkards resolved never
more to mention Miller's name nor to
refer to his and Celia Overholtzer's
shame.
Last night a regular meeting for
prayer and praise took place in the
Dunkard church. The meeting had just
begun when Rev. Mr. Miller and Abra
ham Zug, who is a sympathizer of the
fallen preacher, walked in. When the
prayers were finished Rev. Mr. Miller
rose and the congregation thought he
was going to confess his sin and ask
forgiveness. Instead he asked for a
new trial, claiming he had been
wronged. He said Miss Overholtzer had
prevaricated to make her brother his
(Miller's) successor in the college presi
dency.
Immediately there was an uproar.
The solemn-faced Dunkard brothers
arose by dozens and denounced their
ex-pastor. Some pounded th<> seats In
front of them and excitedly demanded
that Miller get out. Even the usually
demure sisters shook their fists and
screamed at Miller. No one could be
heard in the din of voices.
Several brothers seized Miller and
hurried him into ' a side room, while
several white-haired Dunkards tried to
call the congregation to order. Then
pome one moved that Miller be put out
of the holy edifice altogether, and the
assemblage shouted in approval. A
half dozen brothers laid hold of Miller.
He resisted with all his might, and
while he vainly fought his ejectors and
struggled to be free he was forcibly put
out of the building.
On the outside of the church a band
of Dunkard youths lay in wait for Mil
ler, and he had no sooner been hauled
down to the front door than a storm
of old eggs and rotten vegetables came
full and fair upon him. He turned and
ran. The boys, with hands full of eees
and other missiles, followed, yelling and
pt King him at every step.
It was moonlight and the attackers
had a clear mark. The pastor ran to.
a horse and buggy near the church.
and when he climbed Into his vehicle
his long black coat was a mass of eec
stains. In a second the horse was
whipped up, and amid the yells and
catcalls of the boys he drove down the
road and out into the country. where
he spout last night at the home of
Abraham Zug.

beyond the statement made by Manager ,
Fillmore thai Mr." Steinman had given :
notice of an intention to resign. It was
also stated by Mr. Fillmore that Mr. Han
chette would be appointed to succeed Mr.
Steinman.
Resignation is. indeed, one of the rarest
of Christian virtues, and it is hardly to
be credited that Mr. Steinman decided
to practice It without a suggestion from
the railroad powers that his resignation
would be acceptable. Steinman is a good
caterer, In Sacramento lie possesses cer
tain popularity. So popular, indeed, was
he that at one time he was elected Mayor
of the town. So far ;;s known, no com
plaints have been lodged against him for
the manner In which he conducted the
restaurant and bar. The traveling pub
lic did not kick against the steaks. The
whisky sold at- the bar was never re
viled. The -Hnen of the hotel was not
criticized by the" health authorities of
Sacramento, and yet something happened
which suggested to the Southern Pacific
management that a change was desira
ble.
It Is the opinion of the politiciansâ the
old stagers who have studied the ways
and devices of the Southern Pacific Com
anyâthai Steinman was not smooth in
Soing politics. The talk goes that he
made, a bad break when he proposed to
eliminate General Barnes from the Sena
torial contest in order to uphold the fail-
Ing fortunes of D. M. Burns. The abrupt
manner in which the hotel manager ap
proached the genera] was not commend
ed. Tflere was no tact or polish in the
proceeding. He 'â displayed none of the
qualities of a smooth worker. . : .
Perhaps C. P. Huntingdon was willing
to overlook or condone Borne of the awk
ward features of the transaption, but he
is not the kind of a man to forgive an em
ploye for proposing to settle a matter by
drawing a check for the payment of
money. It is asserted on the best of j
authority that Steinman proposed to im
mediately draw a check on his own bank
to reimburse General Barnes for ex- :
penses and loss of business growing out
of the Senatorial contest. â  There is no
proof that Steinman endeavored to obtain

flowery promises of future favor. The.

WANTED, TWELVE DELEGATES.
California to xÂ»e Represented at tae
Trans-Mississippi Congress.
A few weeks ago the executive officers
of the Trans-Mississippi Commercial Con
gress that is to convene in May sent to
the locaJ Chamber of Commerce a re
quest that the body assist in the distribu
tion of invitations. A special invitation
was to be sent to the Governor to be in
attendance in person and to appoint
twelve delegates to represent the State at
large. To the last the Governor's execu
tive secretary, W. H. Davis, yesterday
sent the following to Secretary Scott of
the Chamber: â¢
I am directed by Governor Cla^e. in response
to the invitation to appoint delegates to â  . pre
sent this State at the Trans-Mississippi Com
mercial Congress, to -.â >. that he would be
pleased to receive from the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce a list of twelve names
which your body would be pleased to recom
racml to him for appointment as delegates. I
wish to direct your attention to the fact that
these commission!", if issued, will be purely
honorary, and that the law nowhere provides
for the payment of the expenses of the dele
gates, but that the same must be borne by the
delegates themselves, with no expense what
ever entailed upon the State.
Mr. Scott states that the Chamber will
not be able to provide for the expenses-,
and it is the wish of the officers of that
body that any well known merchants go-
Ing to the congress should represent the
State and Chamber.

A majority of the members of the Board

an inspection of Gray Bros.' quarry arid
;<.ok-rru.shing plant on Army street.
Several protests have been received from

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1899.
CATULUS DONE
WITH RACING
FOR ALL TIME
Promising Youngster
Broke His Leg.
THREW REIFF AND RAN AWAY
THREE FAVORITES IN FRONT AT
OAKLAND TRACK.
Pat Murphy Comes to the Front
Again â Imperious Enjoyed a Gal
lopâCasdale Turned a Flip
flapâSly Won.
There was fierce betting on a sure
enough "dead one' 'at Oakland track yes
terday. Among the many plunges in
dulged in during the afternoon by the
crowd was one on Duke Wishard's Catu
lus, one of the starters in the two-year
old scramble. So good a thing was it sup
posed, that from 7 to 5 the odds fell to 9
to 10. Flamora and Kitty Kelly were al
most forgotten in the rush to. get aboard.
During the perambulations of the field
while at the post Catulus broke through
the barrier, and, unseating little Reiff,
started off on a mad run that finally re
sulted in his death. The saddle slipped
back, and the dangling stirrups only
served to craze the colt. After making
a circuit and a half of the course he
jumped the outside fence near the club
house, but came to grief at another fence
near the Burns & Waterhouse stable,
breaking one of his forelegs in a fright
ful manner. A bullet ended his misery,
and when the result was made known to
the Judges the bell was rung to start the
field without him. It was a hardship on
hundreds of bettors, but the racing rules I
permitted of no recourse. After being
played to 3 to 5, Kitty Kelly tired at the
paddock and dropped back. Flamora win- j
ning by a head from Armistice, a 30 to i
1 shot.
The track was very muddy, resulting in
three of the favorites meeting with de
feat.
Pidalia. a daughter of imp. Idalium and
Piquante. captured the three and a half
furlong spin for two-year-olds, starting
second choice. Moana, owned by Barney
Schreiber and also a daughter of Idalium,
closed a slight favorite, but Jones put I
up a miserable ride and was beaten out |
three lengths.
The roan horse Pat Murphy received
most of the patronage bestowed by tlit*
"push " in the sprint that followed, and
Bullman landed him winner over De
fender by a length. The latter horse was
a 20 to 1 chance in the ring, and with
equal riders in the saddle could have won.
Major Cook finished in the show.
Dr. Rowell finds nothing but presents on
the Christmas tree for his horses these
days. In the mile and a sixteenth run
Imperious fell into a ridiculously soft
spot, winning in three big splashes at
odds of 1 to 4. Robert Bonner followed
him in, ten Lengths in advance of Whule
back i>,r the place. Half a mile away

in a. race, but his stable did not like him.
Yesterday when the. fifth â 'â  event r was
called the colt' came out bedecked in
feathers and war paint, with a retinue of
stable followers' proclaiming him a "lead
pipe." Backed from threes to 8 to 5 fa
voritism, the three-year-old won romp
ing from Yaruba. with Ach a fair third.
Slippery, stealthy, slimy Sly, the no
madic daughter of Racine, captured the
concluding number, a dash over the Fu
turity course. She backed up in the bet
ting, and then won all the way, beating
the favorite. Heigh Ho, just a quarter of
a dozen lengths.
Track Notes.
Imperious was bid up to $1000 by Louis
Ezell, owner of Robert Bonner, which
finished second in the race. The gelding
was entered to be sold for $300, and was
retained by his owner, Dr. Rowell.
Under Western Turf Congress rules, all
bets would undoubtedly, have been de
clared off, after Catulus had run away.
The California Jockey Club, however, is
racing under a revised set. of rules for
mulated by the New York Jockey Club,
which make no provisions for accidents
that may happen at the post. The horses
are in the hands of the starter, accord
ing to their wording, and there all argu
ment ceases. While they do not permit
of bets being declared off in case of a
casualty at the post, a horse deemed un
fit to start by the officials in the stand
can be ordered scratched, and the other
starters in the race" ordered back to the
paddock.
Bullman has again struck winning form.
Four of the first horses were piloted by
the Montana boy.

The only real safety for a man whose

this purpose is the wonderful "Golden

Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute of
Buffalo, N. Y. This " Discovery " goes di-
rectly to the aid of the enfeebled digestive
forces and enables them to make healthy
nourishing blood, thereby building up
â olid muscular strength and active nerve I
force and energy.
The absolutely marvelous things it does for
nick people is shown by the experience of Mr
Frank A. Start*, of FayeUevilfe. Fayette Co..
Texas who writes: *' It affords me pleasure t<

The Grand Court of California was In
stituted by Major Fred C. HÂ§nsley of this
city, who is known as the father of the
California branch of the ordfr Califor
nia has a membership of 12,883, and of this
number nearly 8000 and thirty-three courts
are located in San Francisco. Since the
session of the pr< vious grand court
twelve new courts have been instituted
and benefits to the amount of $9,0.780 paid
to members, who are entitled to medical
attendance, medicine, donations in cast
of need and funeral benefits. There is
in the funds of the courts an aggregate
of $152,260, which is in excess of %Horn above
what there was the previous year. The
order is. at this tinie. in better condition,
numerically and financially, than it has
ever been before.
At the approaching session, which is to
commence on Tuesday next, there
will be :l preat deal of legisla
tion proposed. Another effort will be
marie to nave biennial sessions instead of
yearly ones, on the ground of economy;^
there will be a proposition to recognize
an official organ and to vote it ;i subsidy
for the purpose of carrying it on; a move
in the direction of securing headquarters
for the order in San Francisco; the sub
ject of appointing special organizers to
work for the extension of the order will
be taken tip; there will be some discus
sion on the proposition of creating a spe
cial extension fund, and that may affect
the per capita tax; there will also be pre-
Fented a proposition to extend the Junior
branch or the order and the question of
securing medical men to attend to the
courts will be brought up. as it appears
that in some sections of the State there
is difficulty in securing the services of
physicians at such rates as the courts are
willing to allow. " .
The supreme representatives will be in
structed to use their influence to bring
about a modification of the ritual iiw in
use as it has not met with the general
approval of the membership of this State.
They will also be asked to induce the
Supreme Court to add to the secret work
a clause creating pass words and grips
that may be used by the members of the
order and members of the Companions
of the Forest of America in ea?e of dis
tress or need frtr assistance on the same
lines as between Masons and the Eastern

ADVERSE TO TEACHERS.
Judge Seawell's Decision in the Case
of Mjss Rose M. Stack.
The status nt teachers who were re
moved from their positions by the Board
of Education during the month of Janu
ary last which resulted from the consoli
dation and discontinuance of their classes
was practically determined by a decision
rendered by Judge Seawell yesterday, the
opinion be adverse to the teachers.
The opinion was rendered as an accom
paniment to an order overruling the de
murrer of Miss Rose M. Stack to the an
swer of the Board of Education to her
suit brought to compel the board to re-
Jnstate her in her position as teacher
rtf a class in the Buena Vista Primary
School. The demurrer was interposed on
the ground that the answer of the board
did not constitute a valid defense to the
action. Judge Soawell held otherwise,
however, the court ruling that the teach
er may be legaljy removed from her po
sition if her class has been legally abol
ished, as it is contended was done in the.
case of the complainant. If the class was
abolished in rood faith, the court further
holds, then tnere is no reason why the
dismissal of the teacher was not legal.
Now that the demurrer has be^n over
ruled the case- will go to trial, and if it
is found that the board did act in good
faith in abolishing Miss Stack's class then
she will b? unable to retrain her position,
and the same ruling will apply to all who
were dismissed under the same circum
stances.

Do You Know Any Such?
Twenty-five years ago we started at Sacra-

opposite of this, and succeeded in building up one
' of the most important retail business houses on the
coast.
A year ago we started a branch store here on
Market and- Taylor streets, and on the very same
methods as in operation at our Sacramento store.
We believe that there is as much need of our
system in San Francisco at this time as there was at
Sacramento years ago. And the public seem to
think so, too.

to the American people demands public scrutiny. He
is not merely a disturbing influence in this
State, but a national menace. Born in Connecticut,
rau-ed in the atmosphere of Americanism, transferred
to Cahtorma among the early pioneers, and with a
business experience extending over sixty years, his

votion to the institutions of Ins country and to the
wehare ot hi> fellow citizens. But, although possessed
of large intelligence and of magnificent opportunities,
he ha assumed the right, by every influence subver
sive of representative government, to dominate the
interests and the communities with which he has been
â â  â 'â¢ :- v .
associated.
- â â â â '. '.-â '
ror thirty years, without concession or relaxation,
he has set and held his railroad enterprises in harsh
resistance to public opinion. He has acknowledged
no right that conflicted with his imperious will, He
has persistently sought to fasten Asiatic cheap labor
upon the country, and he is now openly endeavoring
to neutralize the exclusion laws by throwing his in
fluence in favor of Asiatic -expansion. He has main
tained a firm opposition to all the small communities
in the State that could be injured by railroad strategy
and by railroad tyranny. He has strenuously ob- !
structed public justice and aimed to dominate the
legislative and executive departments of the State
and of the Federal governments. He has applied
such continuous pressure to finance, commerce, trade,
manufacture, horticulture, all the industrial and
wealth-producing factors that required transportation
facilities, as to obstruct and retard natural progress
in every direction. His assumed dictatorship has in
cluded every phase of individual, social and political
life. . . I
But all past assertions of his authority have now
been eclipsed. As the nineteenth century and his own
career approach their inevitable collapse, he appears
to have fallen into that dogmatic excess which
marked the closing years of Louis XI. A most
strenuous effort was made last year to place the re
lations of the people and the railroad upon an
amic; ble and enduring basis. Pledges of withdrawal
from political manipulation were authoritatively
made by Mr. Huntington, through his factotum,
William F. Herrin. When, however, after the cam
paign, based upon principle and openly and honestly
conducted, so far as the Republican press, the ma
joiity of Republican candidates and the mass of Re
publican voters were concerned, the ticket headed by
Mr. Gage was elected, the arrogance of Mr. .Hun
tington became so intense and so conspicuous that it
soon degenerated into weakness. The mask was en
tire':- dropped. All disguises were thrown aside. It
;vr\s openly announced in effect that Mr. Huntington
ovntd the State. He proposed and maintained the
candidacy of Dan Burns. He undertook to destroy
the freedom of the press. He reduced the Railroad
Commission to possession. He occupied so much of
our water fornt as he desired upon his own terms.
ile exercised the functions of sovereignty over the
Governor even to the extent of demanding the viola
ti n of law by the appointment of the candidate re
jected by the Legislature to the vacant Federal Sen-
s-hip.
In all these acts 'he will of Mr. Huntington was
exerted through the direct management of Mr. Her
riii. It is axiomatic that a delegated authority fixes
responsibility on the principal. But in the instance
before us the entire series of treacheries and of dic
tatorial assumptions has been personally ratified by
Mr. Huntington, who has used social opportunities
for that purpose and in measured and clear terms has
paraded his intention to permit no restriction upon
his determination to enforce his rule upon the State
and the nation.
It has been said that "those whom the gods wish'
to destroy they first make mad." Apparently this
stage has been reached by Mr. Huntington, whose
liberty must necessarily be circumscribed in order
that the public safety may be protected.
William F. Herrin is trying to find a local merchant
who will say nice things about C. P. Huntington.
How would Railroad Commissioner Laumeister do?
He went to J. C. Stubbs to learn what the Southern
Pacific considers a fair grain freight tariff for Cali

THE RfICE CONFLICT.
Till 7 , negroes of this country are by no means
all south of Mason and Dixon*s line. Of the
thirteen millions of that race in the United
States a large percentage arc found in the Northern
States, it is believed that* an examination of the
sties of crime will show that their contribution
to the criminal population is below their due propor
tion. They are accorded civil equality before the law,
their rights of person and property arc equally pro
tected and the) follow the callings to which their fit
ness direct- them vi , and .ire not denied the
respect which g ustry and good order. The
publi< â  igher institutions of learning
arc- open to them, and they are not slow in taking
advantage of ever) opportunity to secure an educa
tion. It is difficult to recall an instance in the
North in which a negro has given the capital provo- !
cation for lynching, which is the fruitful source of
race troubles and the cause of much white savagery
in the South. The conclusion from these facts is ir
resistible that the negro in the North is affected by
his environment, and Ins character is built up by his
â  cts and his opportunity for education and en
lightenment. Here lit- makes no claim of social
equality, and is as < tclusjve in abiding with his own
race as are the whit<
All this gives great <<<vcc to the declaration of that
negro scholar, the ablest man oi his race in the
world. Professor V. . â  n T. Booker, who says
emedy for the horrid lawle ness in the South
i- the education of the negro. With education he
', es that hi> race will grow better in character
and stronger in moral purpose, and that the negro
South will approach in conduct and manhood
the negro iii the North.
This is reasonable, and this black scholar should
be supported in his view by the South especially.
Millions of negroes are there. They constitute lar
the laboring population, and when efforts have been
made looking to their v. ' igration the whites
have shown a spirit of bitter opposition and resent
ment ' ippears with a workable plan to
get rid of the black I >n, and the proposition
. .ike them orderly by lynching a thou
â  th until they b ls not yet
: . it would appear that Mr. Booker's
idea that has been pre
sented. It may not take sudden root in the South.
because it depends upon acceptance by the whites, and
its success requires their co operation. As the negro
rises to the plane of moral restraint and self-respect
lie must feel that his common, civil rights are re
. the whites. We are sending missionaries
to the blacks in Africa, and surely it is quite re,-.
to send school-teachers to the blacks in our own
try. But neitl icher will do
any permanent good in solving this sore and sad
the negro are re
spected by the whites. To educate a black man and
expeel ! mil to the treatment of a bond

Th< South have much to learn also.
In tin Stai uth Carolina a respectable, well
beha 1 . ippointed
post! â  â¢ year. The white- resented this by set
to his house, burning several of his children
to death and shooting him and other members of his
famih > 1 ped fi the I s. The mon
sters who did tin's were arrested and put on trinl
thre< of fhem confessed the crime
and told the bloody story in this language:
"At n p. m. about a dozen of us met at the store
and outlined our work. We weir .â¢: by
and - :k of dry â '. md two gallons of
coal oil, and then went quietly to the po ! 'here
Baker and his famih -'> â : t. Two of us left the crowd
in the woods ten _â  â¢ â  â¢ ise, with every
man armed wil I When we
ip to the bu : - a Lee put down the shay
â ! the oil and dashed a bu
the house. One match was struck by Lee,
but it went out; then ai - applied, and in a
sheet of flame covered v the building. We ran
off. We heard the cries of the women and children
in the house. Presently the whites began firing, and
more screams came from the house. When the ;
women were finally driven out they were shot and
the mob pursued them far into the woods. After the
fire was out we all gathered at the Baptist church
and promised to keep the affair quiet so far as it con
cerned ourselves, and went home."
In this affair women were burned to death, and one
infant was butchered in its mother's arms and she
was killed. The crime was not denied, but the jury '
refused to convict the monsters who committed it. ;
Their attorney, Mr. Legare, said their defense was '
"that President McKinley laid the foundation of the
crime by appointing a negro to office."
It is easy to see that if this spirit animate a consid
erable number of Southern whites it must be exor
cised in order to bring in sight any solution of trfe
problem except by massacre. The unspeakable '
savagejy that attended the lynching of Hose in ;
Georgia is so appalling that it is beyond characteriza- !
tion. But, after all, it had the provocation of an un- 'â 
speakable crime committed by the victim. But what
can be said for the midnight assassins of the Baker j
family in South Carolina, where the victims were in
nocent of crime and were noted for their intelligence '
and good order?
It will be seen at once that the negro will reason i
that he has no legal protection for his life, no matter
how excellent his conduct, and as long as the South
ern whites justify that conclusion we may well de
spair of any progress toward the bettering of condi
tions, which are not only deeply disgraceful to the
whole country and retard the material progress of the
S#ith, but which lead to a general race war, the most
pitiless and distressing the world has ever seen.
THE FRUIT SAVING RfllN.
ONCE more the rain of the season has fallen so
opportunely and so bountifully over the
larger portion of the State that it seems al
most to have come in direct response to the prayers
of fruit-growers. It has put an end to the last lin
gering fears of orchardists and gives something like
a positive assurance of good crops.
Profuse as were the heavy rains of March, they
were not quite sufficient for all the needs of orchards
and vineyards suffering from the prolonged drought
of the previous season. Recent reports from several
parts of the State were to the effect that fruit was
dropping badly, and there seems to have been a gen
eral agreement amo^ig fruit men that the trees had
been so weakened by the long dry season they were
not able to ripen all the fruit that had set. The late
rains will of course have a tendency to overcome any
such weakness and will doubtless materially increase
the fruit output of the year.
With the coming of abundant rains many persons
who have been considering the advisability of pro
viding irrigation will be tempted to give no further
thought to the subject. As drought no longer threat
ens the State, they no longer see the need of guard
ing against it. It is natural that it should be so.
Nevertheless, the wisdom of the old maxim, "In
Jime pi gcacc prepare for war," applies to the affairs
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALT,, THtTRSDAT, APRIL 27, 1899.
of individuals as well as to those of nations. Wher
ever it is possible to provide irrigation at economical
rates it will be well for orchardists to do so, although
there is no immediate necessity for it. Good seasons
are the "accepted times" .for such work, as in most
cases it will be too late to provide effective irrigation
if the work is delayed until a drought come-.
In the meantime the people of California have good
reason to be well satisfied with the present outlook.
Prolonged dry seasons are rare in the larger part of
the State, and it will probably be many years before
our farmers and orchardists have to contend with
another such drought as that through which they
have jusi passed. Reports from the East are to the
effect that most of the fruit crops there are short, and
the consumers of the country are looking to Califor
nia for the supply of the year. They will not look in
vain. Our crops are going to be fairly abundant in
almost every variety, and we will have trainloads to
sell.
TriE SAN PEDRO CELEBRATION.

.a. victory over a powerful corporation which has long
been antagonistic to the welfare of California and
which strenuously opposed the San Pedro enterprise.
In reviewing the course of the long struggle re
quired to bring about the improvement at San. Pedro,
Senator White said in an interview with The Call:
"Perhaps there has never been any work projected
in the United States so embarrassed by unnecessary
difficulties. Many of those who opposed the present
location did so in the best of faith, but the public will
never believe, nor would it be justified in believing,
that had not the powerful interests headed by Mr.
Huntingdon been behind Santa Monica there would
have been any serious opposition after the making of
the Mendell report. Individual Senators or Repre
sentatives might have expressed dissent, but the
project would have gone through."
There will be no dissent among intelligent Califor
nians from that statement. Had it not bean for the
antagonism of the -Southern Pacific Company the im
provement of the harbor would have begun- years
ago, and Los Angeles might now be celebrating the
completion instead of the beginning of the work. The
popular rejoicing, therefore, is due as much to what
has been accomplished in throwing off the yoke of the
monopoly as to the high expectations of what is to be
attained through the work itself.
While to the people of Los Angeles and their reso
lute leaders at home and in Congress full credit is
due for the victory they have achieved, it is to be re
membered that they were not left to fight the battle
alone. Throughout the State the independent press
took up the cause of San Pedro and fought with as
much earnestness as if it were one that concerned
each alone.
The Call in particular has good reasons to be grat
ified with the San Pedro victory. It entered early
into the strife on the side of the people and was the
foremost champion in San Francisco of that cause-
Credit is also due to the Examiner, which as soon
as it had been relieved of the $1000 a month contract
with the railroad joined The Call in the contest and
helped to expose the schemes of the monopoly and
reveal its antagonism to the true interests of the State.
To Los Angeles and her people, however, the full
ness of the victory is mainly due, and theirs is of
right the glory of the triumph. The Call and other
papers in different parts of the State could, and did,
help, but Los Angeles has had to take the forefront of
the fight and bear the burden of its cost. Her people
are fully justified, therefore, in making the beginning
of the work a civic holiday, and in giving honor to
those among them who were most steadfast in the
struggle, and most efficient in accomplishing the vic
tory.
Tf-jE "CORKSCREW" RESOLUTION.
THE resolution considered by the Board of Su
pervisors on Monday which grants the Market
Street Railway Company permission to use
electricity upon its proposed "corkscrew" line from
Sixth and Brannan streets to Washington and Jack
son, on its face appears to be innocent enough. But
the Supervisors should take nothing for granted in
connection with this matter. The Market Street
Railway Company is proverbially tricky, and at the
present time it has great interests on Geary street.
The franchise for the present cable railway on that
thoroughfare expires shortly, and the corporation
has made two attempts already to secure its renewal
for a long period of time. Both of these attempts
have been defeated by the property-owners and
residents of the street, who desire the construction of
a modern electric line instead of the maintenance of
the present hobo cable system.
If the resolution granting permission to use elec
tricity upon its proposed ''corkscrew" line does not
confer upon the Market Street Railway Company
some privilege on Geary street by which it will be
enabled to hereafter unhorse the people living upon
that thoroughfare there will be no very strong objec
tion to its passage. But every intelligent person
knows that it is dangerous to confer privileges of this
sort upon street railway companies. At first they ap
pear trivial and commonplace, but later on they cut
tremendous figures in litigation designed to fasten
perpetual privileges upon public streets.
The proposed "corkscrew" road runs on Geary
street, from Taylor to Grant avenue â seemingly a
short and unimportant distance. But it is not a ques
tion of distance in this case, but a question of the
legal effect of such a privilege upon a street which in
a few months will revert again to the people.
There is apparently no disposition among the Su
pervisors to rush hastily into this business. The
resolution referred to has been sent back to the
Street Committee, where it has been under consid
eration for some time. Therefore we do not sound
these words of caution because there fs any imme
diate danger of hasty action, but in order to put the
Supervisors upon their guard. The Geary street
franchise should not be complicated in any manner.
When it expires, which it will shortly, it should be
offered for sale and disposed of to the highest bidder.
A corporation has now held the street for a great
many years and made an enormous profit out of it.
It is about time that the people should receive some
benefit from the valuable privilege of operating: a
street car line along and upon it.
The fact that Railroad Commissioner Laumeister
is a miller may not have influenced him in casting
his voice and vote in favor of the Southern Pacific
\n the passage of the Blackstock resolution ordering
the dismissal of the grain rate case. It may have in
duced him to believe, however, that he could throw
flour dust in the eyes of the public without much cost.

AN HEIRESS
IS ARRESTED
FOR VAGRANCY
Strange Story of Mil
dred Webster.
ELCPED WITH A SOLDIER
DESERTED AND LEFT ALONE -j&
THIS CITY.
Her Adopted Father, Daniel Webster
of Vallejo, Says She Will Get
Part of a Valuable
Estate.
A girl a few months past X years of
age was arrested lasi Friday by Police- |
man Hightower on a charge of vagrancy,
and yesterday it developed that she was
Joint heiress to an estate valued at over
hall a million dollars.
Her name'is Mildred Webster, and she
roomed al 21 Turk street. When she was
arrested she was almost Immediately re
leased on bonds, but when the case was
called in Acting Police Judge Barry's
court on Saturday she failed to appear
and a bench warrant was issued for her
arrest. She was taken into custody on
Tuesday night and appeared before Act-
Ing Police Judge Groezinger yesterday
morning.
Daniel Webster, an engineer at Mare
Island and a Grand Army man. was in
court, and told the Judge a strange story.
He said the girl was his adopted daugh
ter. She was adopted by him anfl his late
wife when she was three days old. He j
was then an engineer on a Mississippi
boat. The girl was bom at Burkes Point,
Butler County. Missouri, and was 16 years
of age last August. Her father, whose
was Whittaker, owned nearly the
half of Butler County, and she and her
sister, who was now living at Cairo, 111., i
were the sole heirs to the estate, which
was valued at half a million dollars.
Webster declined to say under what cir
cumstances he adopted the girl, but when
the proper time* came he could make affi
davit that she was the heiress. He had
warned her, however, that unless she
faithfully promised to behave herself in;
future he would not make the necessary
affidavit.
The girl ran away from her home in
Vallejo last October with Fred Melville,;
a soldier, with whom she was infatuated. 'â¢â 
They came to this city, and two weeks
ago Melville left for Manila. Webster's
Wife died two weeks after the girl ran I
away, and it was only on Tuesday that
he learned that she was here and had
lieen .arrested, so he hurried to the city.
The Judge, after listening to his story,
continued the case till Saturday and re
leased the girl <*n her own recognizance.
Mildred corroborated her adopted
father's statements. She said Bhe always
looked upon Webster and his wife as her
parents until about five years ago. when
after being vaccinated she had an attack
of variolold. While sick in bed she heard
Mrs. Webster tell the doctor who was at- .
tending her that she was not her own !
daughter and that when she came of age
she would be a great heiress. She intend
ed to go to Cairo, 111., to her sister and ;
be a good girl.

LUCAS APPEARS IN COURT.
Further Hearing on the Extortion I
Charge. Against Him.
Detective Lucas appeared before Judge
Mogan yesterday for examination on the
charge against him for attempting to ex
ton money from J. F. Turner of this city.
Severn 1 days ape the prosecution cl
Its case before the lower court, it con
sisting solely of the Identification of the
letters written by Lucas to Turner for the
alleged purpose of extorting money.
yesterday the defense endeavored to
prove that the letters did not contain a
threat and were simply written for the
purpose of obtaining a gettlemeni
account which Turner contend
noi owe. a contention which Turner says
he will prove when the ease g< ts more ad
vanced. Attorney George D. Collins cited
various authorities on his contention that
even though Turner did owe the money
alleged by Lucas to be due him it wi
excuse for the alleged blackmailing let
ters he addressed to Turner with the in- I
tent of extorting money under the threat
of some unknown exposure. The law on
this point is plain, but as Judge Mogan
wished to be thoroughly conversant with
the facts which caused Lucas' arrest he I
allowed Lucas to be examined on the mat
ter of debt. Lucas, on taking the stand.
presented a receipt from Turner for $65
by way of introduction to the debt ac
count, and Turner then presented a sim- ;
liar receipt, it beiim contended by the
cution that the one heltl by Lucas
is none other than a copy of fne original,
which was taken up by Turner, procured
in some mysterious manner not yet dis
covered. Lucas gave some further tes
timony, after which the case went over
till next Thursday to give Lucas an op
portunity to find an account book which
he claims will throw some light on the
debt account.

RANGE FINDER-J. E. M., City. The
range finder that is In use by the United j
States navy was invented by Lieutenant !
Bradley A. Flske, U. S. N. It is described
In the following words:
It Is not at all complicated. Involving only
elementary knowledge of mathematics and elec- j
tricity. It is based on the familiar mathe
matical proposition that if two angles and
one side are known, the other two sides of the
triangle can easily be found. The Flske range
finder, however, eliminates all calculations,
and finds the range automatically. A base line
fixed once for all on the ship is the known side
of the Imaginary triangle. The distance of lha
object is represented by either of. the other
two sides. The target, therefore, at one angle,
of the Imaginary triangle, and at the other
angles at the extremities of the fixed base
line, are placed two spy glasses, which can be
directed upon it. As these spy glasses are
turned Into the proper position they move over
and touch wires which are bent In the form of
arcs. The difference in length of the wires
passed over corresponds mathematically to the
distance of the object. As this length of wire
Increases or diminishes. it will offer more or
less resistance to an electrical current sent
through It. A very simple electrical contriv
ance, amounting practically to a balance, al
lows this resistance to be measured and read,
not In units of resistance but in yards. The
two spy glasses being pointed at the target,
the observer at each- spy glass has nothing to
do but to keep it thus pointed. Elsewhere in
the ship another observer may stand at a tele
phone, listening to a buzzing sound produced
by an electrical device known as a circuit
breaker, and simultaneously moving with one
hand a pointer over a graduated scale. The
instant the buzring in the telephone stops he
reads the range denoted by the pointer from
the scale and conveys the information by a
pimple form of telegraph to the tana, at the
gm^â â â â¢.

STRANGLER BUT
A BOLD THIEF
Positively Identified
by Victims.
ROBS UNPROTECTED WOMEN
SUSPICION THAT HE IS WANTED
EAST FOR MURDEH.
Sufficient Evidence Obtained Against
Him to Warrant the Police In
Charging Him With â¢
Robbery.
Chief Lees is satisfied that Harry Wil
son, the colored man who was arrested
several nights ago by Detectives Gibson,
Wren and McMahon, la not the much
wanted strangler. He, however, la con
vinced that he is a desperate thief, who
would not hesitate to commit murder if
his victim manifested a disposition to re-
Fist him.
The police have ascertained that on the
night of December 1, L 893, Wilson visited a
lodging-house kept by a Mrs. Woodward
at SfoVj Market street and rented a room.
While Mrs. Woodward was engaged
in writing a receipt for him Wilson
knocked her down and repeatedly
kicked her. He then robbed her
of a purse containing |10. Several
months later the victim of the as
sault went to Sacramento, where she died.
Anotner crime which ihe police attribute
to the colored man was on the night of
December 24, 1895. Going to the room of
Larrio Warren, in a lodging-house at 131
O'Karrell street, Wilson, after announc
ing that he was a cat'.le dealer from Mon
ttana; Inquired for a woman named Mrs.
\\ atson. While the unsuspecting woman
was conversing with him ho snatched her
purse containing UO and a diamond ring
and made his escape. The woman is now
living in Salinas.
Last April Wilson visited the house of ;
O.'ra Graham on Stockton street and
robbed her of $25. The previous day he
called on a woman named Mrs. Shipley
who lives at 121 Poweil street and got
away with her purse, containing $25.
Laura Revetti, better known among the
habitues of the tenderloin as â¢'Little
Laura." is also a victim of the desperate
thief. Some time ago he went to her
room at 214 Ellis street; and. catching. her
by the throat, tried to take her purse
lmm her. She screamed for help and
her brutal assailant, evidently becoming
nlarmed, ran from the house and made
his escape. Inez Leonard, the keeper of
a disreputable house on Ellis street, was
also robbed of $000 by Wilson. Under the
pretense that he wanted to see her onMm
1-irtant business he gained an entrance to
'the house. While he was Introducing him
self as a rich cattle man from Arizona
he knocked her down. He then hurriedly
searched the bureau in the room and in
one of the drawers found a package of
greenbacks, which he took. The woman's
screams for help attracted the attention
of a colored servant, who rushed to her
assistance. In the hallway leading to her
mistress" room the servant encountered
Wilson. She attempted to stop him, when
he struck her in the face, knocking her
down. As she lay prostrate on the floor
the: brutal negro kicked her in the
stomach.
The police have the names of two other
women who were also assaulted and
robbed by the desperate thief. They re
fuse to divulge the names of the women, |
but expect to have them present when the I
examination takes place in the Police i
Court.
There is a â .vine suspicion among the
detectives who have been tracing Wilson's
movements that he is wanted in some
other State for a more serious crime than
robbery- They have sent his description to
the various Sheriffs throughout the country
with a view of having htm positively iden
tified. Wilson admits that he has gone
under the name of Martinez, but further
than thai he refuses to answer any ques
tions put to him by the detectives. To
day he will be formally booked on at
Uiist three charges of robbery.

PATRIOTIC MUSIC WILL BE
HEARD ON "DEWEY DAY"
Prominent Members of the Native Sons of Ver
mont Who Are Working to Make Their
Celebration a Memorable One.
THIS city will take on a martial appearance on Monday next. Flags will he flying from every housetop, red, white
and blue bunting will decorate many buildings and cannon will thunder salutes In honor of Admiral Dewpy's
memorable victory In Manila Ray. "Dewey day" will be celebrated throughout the State In a highly patriotic
manner. Every citizen who has an ounce of patriotism In him will lay aside his toil and with his family partici
pate in the f< Btival.
Mayor Phelan Is alive to the occasion and has already completed plans to have military bards furnish music In the
three princi] t the city. Bandmaster Casassa lias been directed to have the bands render patriotic music at
South Park. Union Square and Columbia Park during the afternoon and evening of the great day. The expense for the
music will necessarily fall on the city's executive.
President Edward A. Belcher of the Pacific Association of the Native Sons of Vermont yesterday received the fol
lowing telegram from John 1). Ixuig, Secretary of the Navy:
"Your requ< n regard to Balute acted upon favorably, and commandants Mare Island and Yerba Buena
have been informed."
The foregoing telegram was In answer to a letter sent by Judg-e Belcher to the Secretary of the Navy on the day
Governor Gage Issued his proclamation declaring May 1 a legal holiday, asking that salutes be tired In honor of Admiral
Dewey.
On the same da} ground will bo broken a< the Norwich University, Northfleld, Vt.. for the erection of "Dewey
Hall." It waa at that university that Dewey received his education, and the action of the residents of that State in
ring Its famous son has been commended by the President and every patriotic organization In the country.
President Belcher has made a strong appeal to the members of the Native Sons to attend the grand celebration the
society will hold on "Dewey day" at Sunset Park In the Santa Cruz Mountains. He appeals to them to pull down their
petty cares and hoist their patriotism aloft on that occasion. He wants them to turn out en masse and bring their
friends on that day. "It is desired," he says, "to make this celebration of. the first anniversary of Admiral Dewey'a
victory (so momentous in consequences to us) eminently successful, and the active 00-operatlon of all who love 'Old
Glory' is warmly solicited."
The members have hearkened to his appeal and are already making active preparations to celebrate their holi
day among the trees and I â  ( the Santa Cruz Mountains.
The committee of arrangements, which consists of A. O. Perkins (chairman), M. T. Ellinwood, V. F. Northrop, A.
E. Lucas and Becretary S. <;. Cheever, has worked hard, and there is every prospect that Its efforts will be crowned with
success. The auxiliary committee, which is composed of the following residents of Alameda County, has also rendered
great help, it is composed >>f Mrs. L. J. Hardy Jr. (chairman), B. F. Geddings, L. W. McLaugblln and Mrs. S. \V\

FINANCIER
JAMES SKIER
HAS ARRIVED
A Potent Ally of C. P.
Huntington.
TO NURSE RAILROAD HARMONY
I
HE WILL ARRANGE TO FLOAT
A BIG ISSUE OF BONDS.
The Central and Southern Pacific
Consolidation Scheme Was En
gineered by This Wizard
of Wall Street.
James Speyer of New York City, presi
dent of the New York and London hank
ing house of Speyer & Co., arrived in this
city late last night in a special train from
Monterey and secured apartments at the
Palace. Mr. Speyer ib a visitor of no
small Importance and has the reputation
of being- the leading financier of the day.
He la a close financial ally of C. P. Hunt
ington and his visit is made in connection
with the $125,000,000 bond issue of the Cen
tral and Southern Pacific consolidation,
which his firm is about to float among its
wealthy clients.
When Interviewed upon his arrival he
pleaded fatigue from the journey, but
said:
"Ninety-one per cent of the bondholders
and 90 per cent of the stockholders of the
Central Pacific have consented to the re
organization scheme by which the road
will be absorbed by the Southern Pacific.
My visit here Is to look after the situa
tion and I will pay particular attention to
the two roads and their sources of reve
nue I will attend the meeting of the Cen
tral Pacific directors to-morrow, when tne
final details of the consolidation will be
arranged. It Is my especial desire to pro
mote harmony among the various Inter
ests of the roads, as 1 am responsible to
my clients for a big load of Southern and
Central Pacific bonds and I do not wish
to increase the burden of my responsi
b "The reorganization proposition contem
plates the fssuance of $100,000,000 In 4 per
cent bonds and $25 000,000 In 3^ per cents.
The Central Pacific stockholders are to
surrender their stock to the Southern
Pacific and will receive share for share
of the new issue in exchange to the ex
tent of $68 000,000. In addition the Central
Pacific Issues to the 3outhern Pacific $20,
--000.000 In cumulative preferred stock. It
can. be well understood that this is a gi
gantic undertaking and will require con
siderable financial accumen to accomplish
successfully."

Sail for Manila.
REGULARS NOW ON BOARD
SOLDIER KNOCKED DOWN BY A
VIGILANT SENTRY.
Three Men Arrested on Howard-
Street Wharf for Cruelty to
Animals â Two Men Are
Badly Injured.
The captain of the schooner Webfoot
and the barkentine Newsboy had trouble
with their crews yesterday. The union
men did nut Intend to let these boats get
away without disturbance. The Web
foot was all ready to start, the tug Lib
erty had her Unes on her and just as Bhe
was straightening out two union men who
had shipped on her refused point blank
jto go. Remonstrance was useless, and so
j Captain Atwood ran up the. police Hag.
Two officers went ;i board to investigate,
when the men adhered to their resolu
tion and demanded to be put ashore. The
union boat carried them away. Captain
Atwood had then to come ashore to get
men to till their places.
The barkentine Newsboy, lying at Un
ion street, had also trouble with her crew.
The union men determined that Bhe
should not get away without making
their power felt. In order to avoid the
chance of any fights, Sergeant Thomas i
Maboney was detailed to go down to Un
ion street wharf and keep a sharp look- ]
out and prevent disturbance.
The City of Papeete had to be moved
from Lombard street yesterday to Steuart
street. There was a big swell coming in
from the north, which made the vessel
i chafe badly against the "Â»les, neceasitat
j ing her removal. â¢
! The transports Senator and Ohio were
loading supplies for the soldiers and fresh
meat at Kolsom street wharf yesterday.
I It Is expected that they will leave for
Manila to-day. The first and third bat-'
taliona of the Thirteenth Infantry ar
rived from tiie East earty in the morn
ing anu were marched down to the trans
ports. The second battalion, staff and
band arrived last night.. The Thirteenth
Infantry is under the command of Col
on.-1 Alfred T. Smith and Lieutenant Col
on.l Coe. It was one of the regiments
that made the galiant charge up San
Juan Hill. The Thirteenth Infantry and
recruits from the Presidio will till the two
steamers.
Folsom street wharf was packed with
soldiers. Their anus were stacked in the
middle of the wharf and a strong guard
was placed at the entrance to prevent the
soldiers from getting out and making the
acquaintance of the Bast Btreet saloons.
Despite every precaution, numbers of the
soldiers managed to mak.- their .-scape,
and every hour a corporal's guard had
to be Bent out to round them up. One of
the men made a determined e.ffnrt to pass
the guard at the gate. He pushed the
sentry's rifle to one side and started to
run, but the sentry clubbed his gun and
knocked the runaway senseless. He was
carried aboard the Senator and put in
irons.
Thomas Kelley, living at 1200 Stanyan
Btreet and employed in placing the wires
of the Pacific Patrol telegraph system
I underground at Main and Howard streets,
drove a pick through his left foot and
received a compound fracture. He was
taken to tin Harbor Hospital and was
treated by Dr. Hlmmelsbach.
Martin Hansen, employed on the steam-
I er Leelanaw, crushed his right foot and
; was treated by Dr. yon der Leith at the
i Harbor Hospital yesterday.
There was a disgusting display of cruelty
to animals on Howard street wharf yes
terday. The ship St. Nicholas, Hying the
Hume house flag, was ready to sail for |
Alaska, and a number of bullocks were
to be put aboard. The usual crowd was
down to see the cannery hands away and
the cowboys* determined to give an exhlbl-
I tion of their skill. )ne of them would
lasso a Bteer while another would get be
! hind and force the animal Into a run.
I When it was opposite the ship the. cow
boy who had lassoed the animal would
throw his horse on his haunches and the
Bteer would come down on its side half
strangled.
The nrst Steer that was to be put
aboard was the- one that caused the ar
rest of Robert Miner of. the stevedoring
firm of Eisehen & Miner and Frank Rojas
utnl William Harney, iwo cowboys from
Butchertown. There was no box in
which to hoist the animal aboard, so a
rone was made fast around Its horns, the
other end was made fast to the winch,
the engine was started, and in a few
â econds the struggling brute was hang-
Ing in midair by its horns. There was
no guy rope attached to the steer, so it
hung by its horns for four minutes and
a half before it was got aboard. State
Senator ISraunhart saw the beginning of
the torture and he lost no time in hunt-
Ing up Officers Lake and Shaw. They ar
rived while the steer was in midair and
at once began making arrests. They se
cured three prisoners, but two cowboys,
who were on horseback, put spurs to their
horsea and got away. The prisoners were
charged with cruelty to animals at the
Harbor police station, where they were
released on $50 cash oail.
MIDWEEK NOTES OF
THE PLAYER WORLD
The combination of "El Capitan" and 23
and 50 cent prices is booming the pros
perity of the Southwell company at the
Grand. The production is lavish in the
extreme, and in point of -ensemble and
stage picture superior to the one given
at the Baldwin by De Wolf Hopper. "El
Capitan" will run two weeks and expand
the fortunes of the company.
Roland Reed and his company are pre
senting an interesting farce comedy at
the Columbia Vailed "The Wrong Mr.
Wright." written by Broadhurst, and full
of smart American dialogue.
At the Tivoli "The Geisha," one of the
cleverest musical comedies since "The
Mikado," is enjoying a timely revival.

In Sore Distress,
Officer McMurray of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children yes
terday investigated a sad case of poverty
of a deserving worklngman, Hjnry Lan
niKan of 342 Madrid street. The officer
found' the man's two Little children beg
ging on Sixteenth and Valencia streets
and upon looking into the matter found
that the father, who is a painter, has
been out of work for a long time and his
family, consisting of mx children besides
himself and wife, has been reduced to
dire distress. Pride has kept them from
muking thfir condition known and even
when questioned much reticence waa
manifested. Temporary relief was pro
vided.
'â  An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Syrui of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Sykup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
I medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to the
j taste and acceptable to the system. It
: is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling- colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
i stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
I liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
I taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
: remedy are obtained from senna and
! other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup \
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
! remember the full name of the Company
printed on the front of every package.

PRUNE EXPORTS TO GERMANY.
SUDDEN DEMAND FOR SUPPLIES IS FOL
LOWED BY A SLIGHT STIFFEN
ING IN THE MARKET.
v""The Now V.irk Commercial says:
"As was noted some time ago. there has been
an Increasing demand for prunes from Ger
many, and, contrary to expectations, It has not
diminished. Formerly there was a good trade
with Germany, in prunes, but Agrarian legis
lation compelling odious inspection restricted
experts, and the past season there was tom
paratlvely little trade. Lately, however, the
conditions of Inspection have been so modified
that It amounts li> virtual annulment.
"There has been considerable shortage in
various fruit crops in Germany, and this fact,
together with a modification of the exclusion
decree, has caused an increased demand from
there, SalÂ»-s in the past few days have reached
several thousand boxes, including all sizes,
â  nd. it Is understood, at about lull market
prices.
"The Gorman trade has been considerable in
rears past, amounting In (he fiscal year closing
June 3'), ISHS, to 6,699,345 pounds, valued at
$354,242, according to Government figures, and
showing a larger demand than that Irom any
other two countries combined.
â¢The total exports ol prunes for the year
ending June 30, IS^B. according to Government
receipts, were 15,940,791 pounds, valued at
$1,021,555. Germany took the largest quantity.
Next was France, wlÂ£h nearly 4.OinÂ».UOU pounds.
The United Kingdom took 2,000.000 pounds;
Netherlands. 1,800,000 pounds, and BelÃlum
about 1,000,000, the remainder being distributed
among a score or more countries, taking from
120,000 pounds down to thirty, which were sent
to Cuba. With crops promising well and re
strictive legislation modified or entirely re
moved, exporters anticipate much larger sales
abroad this year than ever before."
MONEY. EXPORTS AND IMPORTS
The New York circular of Henry Clews says:
"The money market has settled Into a con
dition of greater ease, which appears likely to
continue until the fall months. The treasury
has so arranged its withdrawals from the de
pository banks in connection with the payment j
to Spain as to cause the minimum of disturb
ance. The withdrawal of $1.000,000 a week is a
comparatively light affair, when it is consid
ered that the Government's excess of payments
over receipts will cause the return of part of
'.he money to the banks. The money markets
of the interior art: generally easy, and stiff
rates here would be apt to bring currency this
way all the more rapidly.
"Foreign exchange is sustained by the in
crease in the imports, together with the in
tluence of the remittance of $20,000.0"0 to Spain.
Compared with March, ISM, the imports of last
month show an increase of $11,231,017. On. the
export side there is a decrease of $5. 156,527 from
last year and an increase of $17. lSl.Tl!:.' com
pared with ISS7. The March excess of exports
over imports is $31,670.76?, compared with $51,
--1.-.5.313 in 1&98 and $1u.M0,503 in 1897 For the
first quarter of the- year the imports and ex
ports compare as follows:
ISM. IS9S. â  â¢ 1597.
Exports â â â¢;>. $315,964,523 $261,055,216
Imports . : 191,291.423 165.464.546 156.:<42,>33
Excess of ex
ports $122,6:3.313 $150,499,977 $74,112,377
"Thus the surplus of e.-fyorts over imports for
the last three months Is $122.623. 313, while for
the same dates of last year it was $150,499,977,
und in ISS7, '$74. 112. ."77. Compared with the first
quarter of MS there is therefore a decrease in
the surplus of exports amounting to $27,575,6G4.
or at the rate of over $100,000,000 Tier year. It
will be seen from th^se figures that a tendency
has set in, since the opening of the year, to
ward a gradual diminution of the previous
large excess of exports over imports.' 1

rather cheerful tone to the early trading. Six
months' money was offered at 8% per cent on
railroad stocks and at 4 on mixed collateral,

quotations. The crop advices noted some im
provement, and as- a consequence the grangers

Continental Tobacco. National Steel. American
Smelting and International Silver. Denver and
Itlo Grande and Mexican Central were helped
by the rise in silver. Pennsylvania rose 2
points. Union Pacific and Norfolk ad Western
were strong spots among the railways. Ana
conda Mining held more than half of a 6 point
rise on renewed talk of the rumored copper
deal. Brooklyn Transit rose- over 3 points, on
manipulation, with accompanying rumors. Ad
vices that the certificates of the Manhattan OH
Company, the property of People's Gas, would
be Intuited to the stockholders of the latter
concern lifted Peoples Gas .i handsome frac
tion. The coalers became very weak In the

gerated. The break in the coaler* Induced li

demand for Mexican Railway issues and Den

short-time control.
Americans were good all day, closing at the

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 26.â Warm weather and
plenty of rain put wheat traders in a bearish
mood at the opening to-day. Long wheat came
out freely and was helped by a vigorous pound
ing by the bears and the market sagged stead
ily during the tirst two hours. The bears were
overconfident, however, and by complaints of
drought in Nebraska and reports of large ex
port sales were driven to cover. May options
had less recuperative power tha.ll July and the
premium for the latter widened to over a cent.
May opened %Â®%c lower at 71%@71%c, declined
to 70% c, advanced to 71% c and reacted to 7i' 4 .
--at the close. July started a shade lower at
72 1 4,e, sold off to 71Vtc, advanced to 72% c and
closed at 72%@72%c.
The line weather was against corn at the
start, but heavy buying of May by shippers
and. elevator concerns steadied the market.
May closed a shade lower.
' Oats were weak early on perfect seeding
â¢ weather, but heavy purchases by shippers
against cash sales checked the downward
tendency.. May closed slightly lower.
Provisions ruled easier, with the principal
trade in th* changing over of May options into
July and September. May pork, lard and ribs

BOSTON WOOL, MARKET.
BOSTON. April 26.â The American Wool and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow: One of
the principal features of the wool market, dur
ing the past week has been the liberal pur
chasing of Australian wools held in bond by
i Germany. The wools that she has sought are
those which spin anywhere from -60s to 70s, a
large quantity of wool of 64s, quality being
among her purchases. The demand, however,
has run largely to territories and pulled wools,
: Australian and carpet stocks, the sales of car
! pet wools being larger than have been recorded
I for several months. Prices remain unchanged
| but firm. The Bales of the week in Boston
amount to 3,420,000 pounds domestic and 1,550,
--000 foreign, making a total of 4,797,000, again: a
total of 4.931.500 for the previous week and a
total of 532,000 for the corresponding week last
year. Sales since January 1, 1599, amount to
I 66,905,300 pounds, against 42.410.510 last year at
I this time.

NOTICE. TO MARINERS.
Branch Hydrographic Office, U. S. X., Mer
chants' Exchange, San Francisco, Cal
April 26,' 1599.
FORECAST OF WIND AND "WEATHER IN
THE NORTH PACIFIC OCEAN FOR
MAY. 1899.
During the month of May, the sun being well
north of the equator, the wind and weather
may be expected to undergo marked changes
in several parts of the ocean.
The Area of High Barometerâ N. E.
Trades*â The sub-chart of isobars and isotherms
which appears' elsewhere on the chart, and
which expresses generally the meteorological
conditions, shows an almost permanent high
with its center near latitude 35 degrees N. and
longitude 140 degrees W. Around the high the
general circulation of the wind is with the
sun. Along the south side the N. "c trade
winds will be found with an average force of
4 or 5 (Beaufort scale), varying in direction
from NE. to K. N.K., and with northern limit
near the 30th parallel. To the west of the
Hawaiian Islands, in the vicinity of the ->oth
parallel, they will probably be from the east
Northerly and northwesterly winds will replace
the trades between the American coast and a
line drawn from latitude 30 degrees X lone!
tude 130 degrees \V. . to latitude 10 degrees V "
longitude 100 degrees W. The southern limit
of the N.E. and . northern limit of the SP
trades will be found farther north than dur-
Ing April. In the doldrums, or calm regions"
between the trades, much rain. and frequ-nt
thunder storms may be expected along the
coast of Central America.
The Area of Low Barometerâ The Prevailing
Westerly Windsâ the Aleutian Islands
will be found an almost permanent low of con
siderable depth. The general c rculation of
the winds around this low Is against the sun.
In this low area it will be observed, by an In
spection of the suS-chart, that the pressure di
minishes more gradually than last month,
hence lighter winds are to be expected. Be
tween this low and the high there is a general
movement of the atmosphere from Asia to
America, as evidenced by the westerly and
southwesterly winds. In the zone between 3o
degrees N and 50 degrees N. frequent mod
erate westerly gales may be expected, accom
panied by rain, and north 45 degrees N. lati
tude with occasional hail and snow. ihese
gales may be expected, however, to be less
frequent as compared with last month.
Cyclonic and Anttcyclonlc CirculationsâOcca
sional spiral circulations, viz.. the cyclonic
(against the sun), with low barometer, and
the antlcyclonic (with the sun), with high
barometer", will be found moving In a general
easterly direction across the ocean. Gener
ally, in front of the cyclonic area, or the low,
! the weather is damp, with thermometer rising
and barometer falling; while in front ol the
anticyclonic circulation, or the high, it is dry.
cooler, and the barometer rises. The Average
I Storm Track" traced on the chart shows the
average path of the centers of these lows, and
as this crosses the Pacific above 50 degrees N.
latitude, the storms and gales experienced in
this ocean to the southward of the track, and
:::, degrees N. latitude, are generally
from S.W. through W. to N.W.
Monsoonsâ As a consequence of the changes
in meteorological conditions over Asia during
this season, we may expect to find the N.I-.,
monsoon dying out. it being interrupted with
variable Winds and calms until the S.W. mon
soon sets in. steadily along the S.E. coast Of
Asia, toward the end of the month. This
monsoon brings with it the wet season, and
hot. sultry and rainy weather may be ex
pect cd . '
Typhoonsâ Mariners are reminded that th?
season for these storms is at hand, and that
they may be expected to occur with Incn
| frequency as the summer advances. Th
I ter of such typhoons as occur during the prts
! ent month may be expected to follow one or an
other of the tracks designated Id, Hie, 1\ a.
(See list and chart.)
Fog Occasional fog may be expected along
the coast Of China from the Strait, of Formo-
Btt northward to Shanghai, throughout the
Strait of Korea, and along the easi -
Japan; ,-ilso along thÂ° trans-Pacific steamship
routes north of the parallel of 4." degrees and
easi of the 180 th meridian; frequent fog along
1 the American, oast north of San Francisco
I Hay and throughout thÂ» Gulf r.f Alaska.

PETITION TO SUPERVISORS
ORDINANCE IN THE CASE IS
VERY PLAIN.
. l
Demand That "The Thalia," With Its j
Record of Blood and Crime,
Shall Be Licensed to De
bauch No Longer.
It shall be the duty of said Board of
Supervisors before taking final action j
upon any application for a liquor li- j
cense to consider all such petitions j
and in all cases to decide impart.ally â 
as to the necessity or needlessness of
such permission for the accommoda
tion, peace or good order of the public |
according to the number, character j
and showing of the petitioners for i
and remonstrance against such per
mission. â Liquor License Ordinance
of Alameda County.
Oakland pfflce Ban Francisco Call,
_. WS Broadway, April 26.
The respectable residents of Elmhurst
and along the San Leandro road are ;
anxious to keep out of their midst the
disreputable houses that are freely scat- I
tered among their homes and in the vicin
ity where their children play. In this de
sire they expect to have the support of '
the Board of Supervisors, though at pres
ent there appears to be a disposition on
the part of certain members to dodge the
Issue.
For some years there have been all
manner of complaints made of the man
ner in which these roadside houses are !
conducted, but they have generally been
â unheeded. On rare occasions, when crimes
amounting almost to murder have been
committed, a license has been refused,
tut such instances have been very rare.
Last Sunday night a murderous riot be- !
tween drunken men and young women
took place at the den known as the Tha
lia. When the police visited the place the
next day there was evidence of a violent
light. Windows were smashed, furniture
â was demolished and blood was freely scat- !
tered around both Inside and outside the
house. One man, the bartender, had to
be attended to at the Receiving Hospital,
his head having been slashed in several
places by a knife or a revolverâ he was
too drunk to know which.
In front of this den, not long ago, a
man who had been drugged was found
on the car tracks, ancromy by quickly re
versing was the motorman able to pre
vent killing him. It was the headquar
ters of the notorious Greenbank. now in
San iju-ntin for highway robbery. It is
at this time the resort or ( he very lowest
characters; and a constant menace to the
peace and safety of those living near it.
Although it is not necessary for. a for
mal application for revocation to be made,
the Supervisors have been advised of
the facts and it is expected that at the
next meeting the Thalia's liquor license
â will be revoked.
There is another application for a
liquor license pen-ling, that of one Man- !
ning, who wants to conduct a saloon In
Elmhurst. A petition signed by seventy
flve resident? of the little town has been
presented, asking that it be not granted.
The petition says:
Immediately over the place where Man
rinp desires to carry on business is the
only public meeting hall in Elmhurst.
There is 'already one saloon within sixty
fppt and thr>H- others within three blocks.
These petitioners, most of whom have re
plded In ElmhurÂ«t loneer than Manning,
know and Â»o advise your board that such
ta'oon is absolutely unnecessary and need
less for the accommodation, peace or good
order of the public. The granting of the
license would be prejudicial to the public
good, as its location would be next door
to the only butcher shop in town, wlwre
our wives and children are required to ko.
About a year ago the Supervisors estab
lished a precedent of denying the appli
cation for a license on the ground that it '
â was "needless." This was the case of O. i
O. Fox. and' it is eipected that it will be
followed in the Manning case. As there
nre only a few hundred people residing in
Elmhufst altog.-ther. and as there is a
Faloon only sixty feet from where Man
ning would do business, the "needless
ness" of another saloon Is very apparent. |

DEATH'S SUMMONS
CAME QUICKLY
Col. Samuel O. Gregory Dies
of Heart Disease.
COLONEL SAMUEL O. GREG
ORY, a well-known war veteran,
diod suddenly yesterday morning
at h!s retolden !e, 1 1 4 Guerrero
street. He hud been ailing for Borne
time with heart disease, but it was nÂ»t
expected that he would pass away s=o
quickly.
The deceased was an energetic
business man nnd nad been <â¢: .
with the Western Meat Company. Lat
terly he was Interested In several man
ufacturing enterprises. Among Grand
men Colonel Gregory was well
and esteemed. Herentered the
army during the Civil War when he
mere boy of 18 years, attaching
himself to the Ninth ndiana Infantry.
He rapidly rose to the position of
ant and afterward served in the
Twenty-ninth Indiana Infantry, whi< h
was engaged in the West. He was
afterward promoted to the eolonelship
and was placed in command of a
ment in General John F. Miller's bri
gade. In the battle of Stone River he
was wounded In the same engagement
In which General Miller lost his eye.
Colonel Gregory was a olerk in the
Postofflce in this vi:y during S. W.
Backus' first administration, but he afterward resigned to engage in more
business pursuits.
The colonel was a member of George H. Thomas Post of the Grand
Army of the Republic, having become a member in 1879. He was a fine
bass singer and a splendid entertainer.
The circumstances attending his passing away were more than usually
sad for his family. His aged wife was awakened early in the morning by
his moans, and when she hurried to his bedside to render what assistance she
could he gasped and died.
GREAT BOXING BOUTS
AT THE OLYMPIC CLUB
HELL MAN OF SACRAMENTO IS A
SECOND SHARKEY.
He Defeated Champion McCarthy in
Three Rounds of Terrific Punch
ing â Winners of the Evening.
Standing room only was announced at
the entrance of the Olympic Club last even-
Ing long before the first event of the semi
finals of the welter-weight boxing series
â¢ :' contests was held. The large crowd of
lovers of "square" sport saw one of the
!â ' st and most Interesting fistic entertain
ments that the Olympic Club has held in
many years. Every contest was satisfac
tory. Th' re wer,- knock-downs and
kouts and beautiful exhibitions of
scientific boxing. The club can safely say
that : d : marked success, and the
large crowd that was present was an
nee that good boxing will always
..â¢â¢ In this city.
Apart from the exhibitions between pro
f. ssional pugilists the contests !â¢â¢ I
the writers were worth going many miles
The lir=t of the semi-finals of the welter
weight class was to have been a six-round
bout between J. Doyle of the Olympic
Club and F. Ast of the Manhattan Club.

feature of the evening's sport was
ntest between .1. F. McCarthy, the
champion weltei of the Olympic, and A.
Hellman, the battering ram of the Sacra
mento Athletic Club. McCarthy started
do his opponent brown in quick or
d>-r ami he scored uuite a lead in the
Start, landing several times on Hellman's
with right and left. The Sacramento
lad finally realised that he must wake, up
ami (I-. something to protect the interest
â¢ . and h" charged at McCarthy
[exican bull fashion, swinging right
and left. Me ducked the right, but caught
the jaw. Th.- blow stag
the Olympian and Hellman got
three hard Bmashes on McCarthy
before the bell sounded a retreat to cor
ners.

In tÂ»i.- third round McCarthy changed
and played for Hellman's
landing several heav shot, but he

â  1 several swings, and then came
back at Hellamn. planting a torrible right
on the chin which partly dazed the fight
iin from Sacramento. In a rally
that followed, which was give and take,
McCarthy ran into another righthand
, and fell near his own corner.
When he regained his pins Hellman was
about to swing at him again, when the
Olympic champion dropped to his knees
Bely to avoid a knockout. As this
was a transgression of the rulesâ falling
\Vi!!i..in being Struckâ the referee gave.
! to Hellman. amid loud and
prolonged cheers.
A. Snookes of the Manhattan Club was
knocked out in the third round by J.

Frank McConnell and J. McDonald, who
is matched to fight E. Johnson of th^
Multnornah Club on May 24 at the Olym

exhibition.
The final bout of thp evening was be-
I Andy King, the old man from Mon
tana, and Kid McFadden. This was one
of the professional special features pp>-
Vided by the club for the entertainment
of its members. It was a good hard scrap
of give and take from the first to the
last round, which ended in a draw. Wil

ANTI-DERBY NIGHT
IN THE CHURCHES
OAKLAND, April 26.â This was anti-Derby night In all the churches, the
regular midweek services being: supplemented by an expression of opin
ion regarding the propriety of accepting money from -he racetrack for
the benefit of Fabiola Hospital. At each church the protest printed to
day was read and a vote was taken upon it. It was unanimously fndorsed
In all the churches.
Rev E. R. Dille. D.D., of the First M. E. Church, leader of the nnti-Derby
mowment. made a short speech in which he repeated the sentiments ex
pressed by him at the meeting on Monday.
"The ladies of Fabiola," he said, "have not a right conception of what
they are doing. They do not appreciate the magnitude of their error. They
fail to see that the benefit in dollars that Fabiola receives s the smallest and
most insignificant feature of the proceedings. The evil lies In the certificate of
character given the racetrack', in the fearful possibility, perhaps cer
tainty that their sons and daughters might be attracted to the cursed spot
under the guise of charity and there lay the foundation for the passion of
e-nmhline that may end In physical and moral and certainly spiritual death."
At the First Baptist Church Rev. ( \ H. Hobart said: "I feel that it is
unfortunate that our ladies who are directors of the Fabiola Hospital have
Been fit to give thnr indorsement to an institution as utterly demoralizing
Influences as the Emeryville racetrack. This is not a question of re
ligion but one of public morals. It is well recognized by people who have
(riven any thought to thlfi subject that one of the most demoralizing influ
,n our country to-day is borseracing. My Judgment ;s that the ladies
are very â hortsighted even from a financial standpoint. They secure the few
dollars that will come to them from Mr. Williams and they will miss and
lose the moral and financial support of the hundreds of the best citizens of
mmunity." ;

IMPORTANT CAPTURE
OF TWO BOLD CROOKS
Are Suspected of Having Committed
Numerous Petty Depredations
During the Past Month.
Detectives Wren and Dinan effected
jan important rapture last night. J. K.
Norton and George Harrison, two clever
thieves who have given the police no end
j of trouble by their petty depredations,
; were taken into custody and lodged in
; the "tanks" of the City Prison. The men
were considered desperate characters and
w. re brought into the City Prison
manacled to each other. Many com
â  plaints having been mud.' to the Chief of
Poll ! systematic pilfering. Detective
i Dinan was detailed to search for the
i articles said to have been stolon. Having
, located some of the missing trinkets, ho
was given a good description of the men
i and, feeling assured the work was being
carried on with a style similar to that of
Norton and Harrison, he, with the assist
tive Wren, took them into
>dy. The offl ters are now searching
for the suspects' room, as they believe
they will find a lot of booty there.
DEMOCRATS WANT
DISTRICT DELEGATES
The Democratic Central Club, in addi
tion to enjoying the gayeties of a very
high jinks at Pythian Castle last night.
put its, if on record regarding the man
ner in which delegates should be elected
to conventions under the new primary
law. It also ordered the secretary to send
the congratulations of the club to Briga
(ll. r General James F. Smith on his pro
motion.
Oscar Hocks presided at the meeting,
which was a large one, attracted princi
pally by the announcement that well
known speakers would explain the work
ings of th" primary law. which will be
t. st.-d in this city for the first time this
fall. Harry Mulcreavy, Deputy Regis
trar, was the first one called upon Cor
this purpose, and. In an exhaustive anal
ysis of the law. gave the members a prac
tical kiiowl.-ii.uM- of what is to be expected
from its workings. 11.- was followed by
City and County Attorney Franklin K.
I..tn>>. who concluded his ir-marks on the
law with an appeal to Democrats to stand
together and work for the Buccess of the
party at the approaching election, George
Cabaniss, who followed later In the even
ing, made a characteristic address,
which drew forth much applause. James
Bowlan, Charles Eiolcomb, ex-Senator T.
E. Tracy and other members of the club
made short addresses, mterluded with
5..i,>.-s by Jimmie Donahue, Will McMur
ray and Johnny McDonald. Harris' iir
tra played numerous popular selec
tions.
In a resolution offered by Charles Hol
comb, the dub declared In favor of the
election of delegates to conventions by
thp district system, as against their selec
tion by the voters at largeâ that is. that
the voters of a district or precinct vot<
for delegates nominated for that district
or precinct, as the case may be, and for
no others. It was adopted unanimously.
Bunker Hill Celebration.
The joint commltfee of the Bunker Hill
Association, Sons of the American Revo
lution and California Pioneers met at the
Occidental last evening to make further
arrangements for the celebration of " the
anniversary of the batt!Â» of Bunker Hill
on June 1".
An invitation was extended to Rev. T.
J. Lacy, pastor of <'hrlst Church, Oak
land, to act as chaplain of the day.
The committee on transportation re
ported that two t^filns would leave from
the foot of Market street at 7:45 and 8:45
a. m. on the daY of the excursion to Sun
s>t Park, Wrights station. Returning, a
train will leave at 5 p. m.
A communication was ordered sent to
Governor Gage, requesting him to pro
claim Juno IT a legal holiday.
President Badger appointed a committee
on the raising of flags and salutes to con
sist of Allen Knight, Robert Collier. Wil

PUNS FOR

AND BURNS ATTEND.
i
Will Railroad Commissioners Lau

Favor?
I
I .
i The annual banquet to be given at the
Palace Hotel this evening Â»in compliment ;
to the president of the Southern Pacific i
Company promises to bo a gorgeous feast. j
The dinner was planned by the heads of
the various departments of the railroad.
Owing to the policy of expansion adopt
ed by the promoters of the banquet many
representative bankers and merchants of
San Francisco will break bread and drain
a glass of wine with C. P. Huntington
and General Hubbard.
Many little details have yet to be ad
justed in order to insure the complete
success of the event. The table, fash
ioned in the shape of a horseshoe, will j
be spread in the main dining-room of the
Palace, It was the estimate last night
that covers would be .aid for one hundred
and fifty. As the invitations are general
as applied to leading business men of tne
community and others who are in close
touch with the company, the acceptance
may exceed present calculations.
In seating the guests a great deal of
diplomacy must be exercised.. It is easy
enough to place C. P. Huntington in the i
Beat of honor, and General Hubbard is
certainly entitled to be seated near the j
throne. Should Governor Gage and Colo- I
nel D. M. Burns attend It might embar
rass the company, to indicate where they
should be placed.
Should Railroad Commissioners Black
stock and Laumeister be present in con
junction with Gage and Burns the
smoothest kind of tact would be required
to preserve the harmony of the occasion.
That acknowledged master of all things
intricate and complex, Vice President J.
C. Stunbs, would surely then be called
upon to classify the attendants.
The Governor might have a dozen invi
tations to the banquet and not respond to
one. Word comes from the south that he
did not acknowledge, the compliments of
an invitation to the Free Harbor Jubilee.
Should he drop in along with Colonel
Burns, invited yet unexpected, could they
be placed next to Mr. Huntington or
nearer to the throne than the place re
served for the two Railroad Commission*
ers? Many delicate points might be pre
sented pending the solution of the ques
tion, and yet Mr. Stubba or Mr. Mills
would be required to act promptly In the
presence of Mr. Huntington. Leaving
aside gratitude, which, after all, philoso
phers say is but "a sense of the favors-to
come," the decision would have to be ren
dered on a basis of justice to the corpora
tion. The point would arise. Are nut the
Commissioners the more deserving of
recognition and entitled to preference over
a Governor and a 'gold brick Senator?'
It might be contended, on the other
hand, that the Commissioners belonged to
the railroad family, and were there as I
givers rather than guests of the ban
quet. All these little questions of pro
priety touching the relative proximity of
State officers to the chief of the corpora
tion would demand instant adjustment.
a- suggested, past services would not
alone count, but the ability to rentier fu
ture service would demand serious but
Instant consideration. It would never
do to change positions once assigned,
and. for one. Gage would fight before he
would get up and give, his seat to Black
stock or Laumeister. Wherever Gage is I
placed he will stay, and If he makes one :
of his campaign speeches the dinner will
be a victory for the people on the out
side _____

CONSTERNATION
REIGNS ON THE
HARBOR FRONT
Many Employes to Be
Dismissed.
COMMISSIONERS ECONOMIZE
PURCHASING DEPARTMENT TO
BE ABOLISHED.
The Board Decides at a Secret Session
to Effect a Saving of Two
Thousand Dollars a
Month.
nsternation reigns in the army "f
w ater front emploj â¢ tlon from
the extravagant, money-absorbing ad
ministration of Colnon has come and
to-day the ax of dismissal will fall
upon the necks of many of the favorites
who have drawn large salaries from the
State and have given nothing in re
turn. The Board of Harbor Commis
sioners m â â : session yesterday
afternoon and after an earnest discus
sion, lasting for nearly three hours, de
termined upon sweeping changes in the
working force upon the water front.
The startling revelations of extrava
gant fraud mad.- public in the report
of the legislative committee led to a
ugh investigation and the Harbor
9 bell< ye that the admin- '
tion of affairs upon the water front
vftll in no way suffer if at least twenty
men are dismissed from the service and
a saving i ibout $:>"" a month.
At the sei ret sessi< n held yesterday
afteri!' .m Commissioners Kilburn, Har
ney and Herold were present. The j
le of different departments on the '
water front wen 1 failed before the
board and were closely questioned in
reference to the conduct of their separ
ate departments. After a thorough dis
cussion it was derided to abolish the i
purchasing department and the depart
ment of urgent repairs. The purchas
ing: department was the particular pet
Inon. Its cost of maintenance was
almost as great as the volume i
business. In other words the total of j
purchases was not much greater than
the salaries of the men who made the
purcht
Tin <rf this outrage was
called to the attention of the i.
lature at its last session by the â 
mittee of Investigation, but nothing was
ard of Harbor Commis
tnined upon reform
I to abolish the purchasing de
partment. Purchases will be made
hereafter through the heads of the
various departments and one of the
evil? of Colnon'a administration will
be removed.
The department of urgent repairs Is
also another expensive luxury to the !
State that will be eliminated. The |
duties of Its officers will be assigned i
where they rightly belong, to th
partment of the rhlef engineer. In this ' [
way the salaries of several expensive ,
officers will be saved and nothing will j
be lost in the effectiveness of water
front administration. The commission
ers have also decided to dismiss nearly
nil of the special police officers, who
are paid to do what the regular police
of the city are employed to perform.
Considerable money has been v
to the State in the employment of these
special officers and the evil will be
remedied. A few men whose services
are absolutely necessary will be re
tained.
In the general scheme of economy un
dertaken by the Harbor Commission
ers it was thought that some of the
collectors might be removed and that
their duties could be performed by
wharfingers. Investigation showed,
however, that the collectors are statu
tory officers and must be retained. It
has not yet been definitely determined,
however, what shall be done with the
working force of the belt railroad.
There is a belief that some of the men
employed on this road may be dis
missed without injury to the service,
and if this is the case the ax will be
wielded.
The position of superintendent of the
ferry depot will not be abolished, al
though the decision not to abolish it
was seriously considered. The Commis-
sioners will meet in secret session again
this morning at 10 o'clock to fix defi
nitely upon the men that are to be re
moved. If the plans of the board are
not changed the members will also
meet in public session at 2 o'clock to
announce the results of their unex
pected campaign of economy.
News of the secret session of the
board spread rapidly yesterday, and
the employes on the water front were
thrown into an uproar. It was known
that sweeping changes were to be
made, but few suspected that the re
form was to come so quickly. Official
and unofficial protest againÃt the gross
extravagance of the Colnon administra
tion had been made, and it was known
that a reaction was inevitable.

SABBATH LAMP
.Miss Clara .Hellman and Emanuel S.
teller Plight Their Troth.
STANDING in a bower of exquisite blossoms, under the gleaming rays
of a Sabbath lamp, Miss Clara Hellman and Emanuel S. Heller
plighted their troth last evening in the presence of a large company of
relatives and friends. The young bride is the daughter of I. \V. Hell
man, president of the Nevada Bank, and the happy groom the son
of the late Mosea Heller.
At the stroke of 6 o'clock the young couple took up their station before
the Rev. l>r. Voorsanger, who pronounced the solemn binding words.
The Dride was attended by her slater. Miss Florence Hellman, who of
ficiated as maid of honor, and Samuel Helier, brother of the groom, was
best man.
The bride wore an elegant gown of white Duehepse satin, covered com
pletely with an overdress of point and applique lace. The veil was fastened
to the coiffure with a wreath of orange blossoms and the bridal bouquet
was composed <>f white orchids and orange blossoms. Miss Florence Hellman
wore an exquisite gown of white silk mulle. embroidered with tiny pink
rosebuds. She carried a bouquet of American Beauties.
The decorations of the home were elaborate and artistic. In the draw
ing-room, where the ceremony was performed, yellow orchid-iris were ar
ranged in Empire style, and made a most effective decoration. In the sup
per-room white wistaria was used exclusively and pink hawthornes made
the halls beautiful.
Mr. and Mrs. Heller will leave to-day for a bridal trip, keeping their des
tination a profound secret. On their return they will make their home in
this city.

I
CONDITIONS AT THE EXPOSI
TION POOR FOR CALIFORNIA.
Then, Too, the Railroad Land Agent
Thinks That He Cannot Be
Spared at That Time From
the State.
A Bpecial to The Call last night from
L,os Angeles stated that Governor Gage
had received a dispatch from W. H. Mills
of this city declining the appointment as
one of the Commissioners to the Paris
Exposition and citing as the cause of his
declination that the Southern Pacific ob
jected to his" being- absent from the State
during: the term of the Exposition.
Mr. Mills, when seen at his residence
last night, confirmed the dispatch by say- ,
ing that he had wired Governor Gage at
Los Angeles declining tfie appointment,
and he further admitted that it was true
that the Southern Pacific objected to his
being absent for such a long period. This
he said was In part the cause of his de
clining the appointment, but he added ,
that there were other causes that had
Influenced him.
These, -Mr. Mills said, were the fact that
be did not think that California would
be permitted to make a creditable exhibit
at the exposition because of the fact that
the State would not be given sufficient ;
space. He said that he had been in com
munication with" one of the directors gen
eral of the exposition, and that he knew
this to be a fact. He stated that Cali
fornia's wine exhibit would have to' be
placed with the other American exhibit
of the same kind instead of being given a
place by Itself, as it deserves.
When asked what plan he favored Mr.
Mill* replied that he would advise turn- ;
ing the money back into the State treas- :
Dry.
These were th^ special reasons, he de- !
clared, that had caused him to refuse
Governor Gage's appointment.

NOTABLE IMPROVEMENT
IN RAILKOAD PROPERTY
President A. W. Foster Adds to His
Rolling Stock and Looks to Er.rly
Extensions in Mendocino
County.
The California and Northwestern
Railway Company, lessee of the San
Francisco and North Pacific Railroad,
has once more come to the front as a
progressive and aggressive factor In
the upbuilding of the State. It is not
bo very long since this company
aroused general comment, nnt only
here, but in the East, by the establish
ment and maintenance of an extensive
fish hatchery for the stocking: of
along its line with the best
varieties of the finny tribe.
Ever since the conflicting interests of
the road were harmonized in the leas
ing of the property to the C. and N.
W. Company, Mr. Foster, the presi
dent, has devoted every energy toward
the accomplishment of his ultimate
purpose, namely, the extension of the
line into the redwoods of Mendocino
County, a section of the State but lit
tle known to the average Californian.
but immensely valuable in Its mineral,
agricultural and timber resources.
This extension will be a matter of
the near future. The company has re
cently purchased five elegant coaches,
adding to its passenger equipment,
which is already large and costly in
proportion to the mileage covered.
Three of these coaches are richly fin
ished in mahogany, with the latest
style of walk-over plush seats, and
with large curtained windows and
ladies' retiring rooms, the ceilings being
finished in birdseye maple. The other
two are a smoking car and a basreaere
and smoker combined, finished in quar
ter oak. These cars provide seating ac
commodations for three hundred and
twenty-five passengers.
The cars are mounted on latest
improved trucks, giving them an easy
motion, hardly perceptible at high
speed.
These additions to rolling stock and
contemplated extensions and improve
ments along the entire line are merely
the outgrowth of that broad publle
spiritedness which stamps Mr. Foster
as one of the leader? in the manage
ment of railway affairs on the coast. He
has seen fit to forego the opportunity
to pay out dividends and to apply the
earnings to the betterment of the prop
erties he controls, thus advancing the
popularity of his line and iding in the
development of the industries of the
northern section of the State.

SAMOAN COMMISSION
SAILS ON THE BADGER
THE AUXILIARY CRUISER DE
PARTS FOR APIA.
Navy Department Orders Vessel Char
tered to Overtake Her With a
Message, but Later Re
scinds the Order.
The United States auxiliary cruiser
Badger sailed for Samoa yesterday with
the United States, British and German
Commissioners aboard. Eliot represents
Great Britain, Baron Speck yon Stern
berg represents Germany and Bartlett
Trlpp the United States.
The vessel got away at 10 a. m., and
she had scarcely passed out of sight when
a telegram was received from the Navy
Department at Washington directing
that a vessel be at once chartered and
put in readiness to overhaul the Badger
before she could depart from Honolulu,
and deliver a message. While* the local
officials were hurriedly making the
necessary arrangements for carrying out
the instructions a second telegram was
received countermanding the first.
No intimation was conveyed in either
of the telegrams as to the import of the
message that was to be delivered to the
Badger, although there was considerable
speculation concerning it.
The famous old JESSE MOORE WHISK T U

POLICE COMMISSIONERS IN
SPECT NOTORIOUS JOINTS.
'. ~~
Warn the (Proprietors to Obey the
Law or Suffer the Consequences.
No Successor to Price.
The Police Commissioners met last
night, but for some reason did not ap
point a successor to Lieutenant Price,
who was disrated >a- short time ago. It
was confidently expected that a new lieu
tenant would be appointed, and as a re
sult a number of friends of the respective
candidates for the â¢position hovered about
the meeting room of the Commissioners,
anxiously awaiting the news of a selection
by the police board. They were disagree
ably surprised when told that the Com
missioners had decided not to make the
appointment until the next meeting
night. "' "I
Immediately ' after going into executive
session the Commissioners : discussed the
crusade aginst vice inaugurated by The
Call. The list of saloons and other places
where vice is prevalent was furnished the
Commissioners by Chief Lees. After con
siderable discussion it was decided to no
tify the proprietors of the Cafe Royal, the
Metropole, the Palace saloon, Conway's
"Our House" and the Midway Plaisance
that unless they obeyed the law they
would be refused a license in the future.
After the meeting the Commissioners, ac
companied by Lieutenant Nash, visited
the disreputable Joints along Market
street and saw for themselves the noto
rious violation of the law. They are de
termined to suppress the evil and have
notified Chief Lees to do. all In his power
to close up the dens.

Put Out a Fire.
As Herman Goldman, an employe of I.
Goldman, was driving along Folsom
street, near Twelfth, yesterday afternoon
he noticed the window curtains in the
house at 1612 Folsom street ablaze. He
rushed up to the door and rang the bell
but getting no response he entered the
house and tore the blazing fabrics from
the window. By his prompt action a
serious fire was averted.
