TEN LIVES LOST
ON THE CHILKAT
CHILKAT TURNED TURTLE ON HUMBOLDT BAR
EUREKA, April 4.â One of the
worst wrecks, as regards loss of
life, in the history of Humboldt
bar, occurred this morning. The
little steamer Chilkat, with
nineteen persons on board, left Eureka
at 10 o'clock. Before noon she was bot
tom side up on the bar and ten of those
aboard were dead. Of the nineteen on
the vessel thirteen were officers and
seamen and six were passengers. Of
the passengers two were saved and four
lost, and of the crew seven were saved
and six lost.
The Ghilkat left Eureka at 10:20
o'clock and .arrived at the bar at- 11:17.
She proceeded to cross and was almost
over the bar when a big sea struck her
forward, carried away the wheelhouse
and the wheel, disabling her steering
gear, and smashed her upper works
generally. The captain called for a j
block to construct a temporary steer
ing gear, but before anything could be
done the helpless boat fell into the
trough of the sea and the men came
piling up from below with the informa
tion that the water had poured in and
put out the fires.
The ship was entirely helpless and
another breaker went over her. Every
body got up on the hurricane deck and
.an attempt was made to get the small
boats clear. The breakers followed
each other fast, and the fourth and
fifth struck the ship in such a way as
to turn her upside down.
The captain had ordered those
aboard to put on life preservers. All
were on deck except O'Brien, who was
lost overboard. The North Fork was
about 150 yards ahead. The Chilkat j
careened toward the shore side and
remained partly turned over for five
minutes before she turned turtle.
Three boats were launched. The first
reached the North Fork. The second
capsized, but its occupants reached
shore. The third was never heard from
again. The saved passengers were H.
Smith of Scotia, this county, and W. C.
Morser of Oakland. Morser is a car
penter and his home is at the corner of
Oakland avenue and Orange street,
where his family resides. He had been
working near Ferndale for several
months.
The lost passengers are M. O. Buzan 1#

THE POPE'S
LIFE HANGS
BY A THREAD
His Real Danger Is That
He Cannot Take Proper
Nourishment.
MUST GUN STRENGTH
Small Hope Unless He Turns
for the Better in the
Spring.
Precial Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. April s.â The Rome cor
respondent of the Daily Chronicle
says: "The Pope is able to be up and
about, but he cannot do his custom
ary work, and the Vatican routine
has to be executed without personal
reference to him.
"The danger from his fainting fits
has been exaggerated and the real
reason for anxiety is his inability to
take sufficient nourishment. His
Holiness may keep going so long as
there is no extra pressure upon him,
but his life will hang by a slender
thread unless he gathers strength
with the returning spring."
The other three washed ashore on
wreckage. They -were taken out of the
water by three women at the life-sav
ing station and are now in this city.
They are Mate Johnson, Fireman Han
sen and Passenger Morser.
These brave women of the life-saving
station, whose husbands even then
were risking their lives in a fruitless
attempt to save the passengers and
crew of the vessel, went to the beach to
follow with their eyes the boat that
bore their loved ones. Their fears (or
their own did not blind them to the
needs of others, and when the half
drowned men frc-rn the wreck were
sighted floating in toward the beach
they rushed bravely into the surf and
dragged them out, one after the other.
These heroines were Mrs. Hennig. wift
of Captain Hennig of the life-saving
crew; Mrs. McLain, wife of one of his
brave boatmen, and a sistor of Mrs.
Mr-Lain. Tne three- men had been in
the water an hour.
The tug Ranger was sent for and
quickly responded, relieving the North
Fork, which had stood by the wreck.
No bodies have yet been washed
ashore. The wreck .is now drifting
southward. Wreckage is coming
ashore. The cargo consisted of boxes
of butter, hides, shingles, lumber, con
densed milk and apples. It is scattered
on the beach.
This was the third time within a year
the Chilkat has met with a mishap on
Humboldt bar. Once her sternhousp
was stove and next her side was punc
tured. She was originally a fishing
tender tug used at the canneries in the
Oregon rivers, and was built at Asto

VIRGINIA FAIR THE
HAPPY BRIDE OF
YOUNG VANDERBILT
MR. AND MRS. WILLIAM K. VANDERBILT JR.
NEW YORK, April 4. -Miss Vir
ginia Fair, daughter of the late |
Senator James â¢:;. Fair of Cali
fornia, at nopn to-day was mar
ried to William Kipsam Vander
bilt Jr., elder son of William K. Van
derbilt.
The ceremony was performed by Rev.
Father Murphy of St. Patrick's i
Cathedral in the ballroom at the home j
of the bride's brother-in-law, Herman
Oelrichs. at 1 East Fifty-seventh street.
In magnificence the details of t'.;< j
wedding equaled the Vanderbilt-Marl
borougfa union; in simplicity it might
have been performed in a cottage: in j
lavish display of wealth and extrava- I
gance it easily rivaled the Gould-Cas
tellane marriage; in quiet and serene
Joy it might have been a modest coun
try home wedding, that is. except for
the crowd outside, that tilled the streets
and craned ne< ks for only a fleeting
glimpse of bride, bridegroom or guests.
'Ph.' crowd was patient when men of
affairs and millions rolled up to the
stately home of the Oelricha In car
riages. It was impatient and eager
when women laden with fortunes in
rare and glistening gems glistened Cor
a moment in the' sunlight, then entered
the canvas lane leading to the house.
But it was wild, impetuous and uncon
trollable when the bride ran from the
house \vith her husband in a shower of
rice and followed by the bridal slipper,
thrown by a sure hand. Then the
crowd broke the police cordon and
swarmed around the pair. There was
only a scramble, a jostling, then the
crowd fell back and made amends by
giving a hearty cheer for the lucky
young Americans.
The flowers used in decorating the
ballroom for the wedding were after
ward distributed among the patients
in Bellevue Hospital.
Perfect in every detail were the ap
pointments of the wedding. There were
assembled in the ballroom where the
marriage ceremony was performed less
than one hundred and fifty persons.
relatives and intimate friends of the
bridal couple. The ballroom was made !
to resemble a chapel as much as pos
sible, and an aisle, formed of a very tali
rose trees in full bloom, was placed in
the center of the room and extended to
the conservatory at the east end, in
front of which was erected a prie dieu,
behind which the priest stood.
The conservatory itself was hung
with pink gauze and the walls entirely
covered with branches of quince and
apple in full bloom, making altogether
a beautiful floral bower.
On either side of the aisle were placed
gilded chairs and the guests were
shown to their assigned places by
Roman Baldwin and Clarence H.
Mackay.
On the right side of the aisle were
seated Mrs. Herman Oelrichs and her
young son, William K. Vanderbilt, Mr.
and Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt, Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Paine Whitney, Alfred C.

and Mrs. Jay, Miss Eleanor Jay. Miss
Armide Smith. Mrs. Kellogg, Mr. and
Mrs. Charles < ">. Irii hs, Miss Lily Oel

While the guests were being seated
Emil Paur's orchestra of thirty, with
harp and organ, played Handel's
"Largo," Nathan Franko playing the
violin solo from the wedding music of
A.' Jensen and Mendelssohn's "Spring
Song." The orchestra was stationed in
the music gallery.
Just before the strains of the bridal
chorus from "Lohengrin" announced
that the bride was about to enter the
ballroom. Father Murphy, attended by
two arolyt.s, passed through the aisle
to the prie dieu, and immediately af
t< rward the bridegroom and his bes,t
man, J. Prenticp Kellogg, made their
entrance from the conservatory.
Just as the- orchestra began the
"Lohengrin" music, Messrs. Mackay
and Baldwin and Miss Mary Baldwin
Tolfree, maid of honor and only at
tendant of the bride, entered, the ball
room from the salon at the west side
of the house.
They were followed by the bride-, who
was escorted by her brother-in-law, Mr.
Herman Oelrichs. Miss Fair's wedding
gown was made in Paris. The founda
tion was of Ivory satin, cut with a long
train. This material was covered with
fine point d'esprit of the creamy tint,
corresponding to that of the satin. In
stead of point lace, old cream-colored
Irish lace, which is somewhat heavier
in texture, was used in appliqued de
signs all over the gown. Lengthwise
insertions trimmed the front of the
skirt, the train was bordered with a
deep edging and the upper part of the
corsage was entirely of the lace. The
sleeve reached barely to the elbow and
partly of lnce and point d'esprit. She
wore a veil of tulle.
Mrs. Oelrichs wore a gown of light
blue, as did Mrs. Belmont, the mother
of the groom. Mrs. M. H. de Young
wore a grain passeta gray silk with
tulle bonnet.
The groom's present to the bride was
a pearl necklace and a pearl and ruby
pendant, which are said to have cost
$70,000.
Miss Tolfree's bridesmaid gown was
a wonderfully elaborate and effective
combination of white chiffon and point
applique lace. The gown had a prin
cesse effect. The skirt was shirred to
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
the knees. Below this the necessary
flaring effect was supplied by two very
full flounces of chiffon, edged with a
lattice like border of white satin rib
bons. A gauzy half-length overdress or
tunic was bordered with applique in
sertion. The bodice was even more
elaborate and had a yoke of applique.
Th^> sleeves, which reached only to the
elbow, were shirred like the upper part
of the skirt and edged with a flounce
of lace. The white satin belt was fast
ened by Miss Fair's gift to her brides
maid, an enormous diamond buckle.
Miss Tolfree carried a muff fashioned
of pink roses.
Father Murphy made a short address
to the young couple on the importance
of the new life they were entering, and
then followed the brief marriage cere
mony.
Just after the couple had been pro
nounced husband and wife the ever fa
miliar "Wedding March" of Mendels
sohn was played.
The first thing the bride did was to
greet her husband and th'-n she em
braced, in turn. Mrs. Oelrichs, Mrs.
Oliver H. P. Belmont, William K. Yan
derbilt. Mr. Oelrjchs and his little son.
Immediately afterward an informal
lion was held, all th^ witnesses
of the marriage ceremony stepping for
ward to offer their congratulations. As
soon as this bit of formality was over
the bridal couple led the way to the
dining room on the floor below the ball
room, where the wedding breakfast
was served by Sherry. In the rlining
room five tables were placed â that of
the bridal couple extending across one
end of the room.â and four others be
ing at right angles to it. The bridal
table was decorated with lilies and was
slightly raised. The bride and bride
groom and a dozen friends were seated
on one side only, so that they could
look at the assembled company. At
the bride's right was Miss Tolfree, and
next t" Mr. Vanderbilt, on his left, sat
his best man. The others at the table
were Mrs. Arthur Kemp, Mrs. Clarence
Mackay, Miss Ldla Sloarie, Alfred Van
derbilt. Reginald Vanderbilt, Roman
Baldwin. Clarence Mackay and Wil

William K. Vanderhilt Sr. escorted
Mrs. Oelrichs to one of the long tables.

cream-colored canvas. The hat. of yel

MONTANA REGIMENT AND
A CAVALRY TROOP DISPERSE
A BODY OF INSURGENTS
MANILA, April 4 â A reconnois
sance in force was made to-day
and was unopposed.
Mac Arthur's division is likely to
continue the advance begun to-day
to Calumpit. The place is more im
portant, strategically, than Malolos,
Calumpit River being navigable to
Manila Bay and besides affording a
needed water supply superior to that
at Malolos.
Copies of the proclamation issued
by the Philippine Commission are be
ing distributed.
The Montana regiment, with two
guns and a detachment of cavalry, all
under command of Lieutenant Colonel
Wallace, made a reconnoissance in
force to-day in the direction of Calum
pit. The country was thoroughly
scoured, with the result that a body of
the enemy, numbering upward of a
thousand, was found a few miles from
Calumpit. Our troops attacked the
Filipinos, who made a brief defense and
scattered. It was useless to pursue
them, so the Americans returned to
Malolos.
In the skirmish we lost one man killed
and four wounded.
In searching through a building in
Malolos, formerly occupied by the
treasury department of the insurgents,
but which is now the American head
quarters, three safes were found. In
one was 523,000, which had been aban
doned by the rebel government in its
precipitate flight from town on the ap
proach of the American army. The
contents of the other two safes are not
known, they not' having been opened
yet.
The belief is spreading among the
residents here that the effect of the
capture of Malolos, the former rebel
capital, followed by the proclamation
of the Philippine Commission, will be
to convince the natives that Aguinai
do's bubble has burst. Dr. Schurman,
president of the commission, said:
"The Filipinos have been asking un
ngly, 'What do you propose to do
for u.s." The proclamation answers the
question and it should satisfy them."
Colonel Charles Denby, a member of
the commission and former Minister to
China, remarked:
"It is the most important proclama
tion since the declaration of independ
ence. Spanish, Tagallo and English
versions have been printed and it is
proposed to circulate them about Malo
jos and at all the seaports. They will
lit- sent to the lake towns by gun
boats."
The committee of Spaniards under
the leadership of Senor Antonio Fusa,
president -of the Spanish Club, has had
little success with the expedition or
ganized to deliver money and stores
to the Spanish prisoners. The members
of the expedition were obliged to give
the goods to the Filipino officers at
Batangas. The boat had a letter from
Aguinaldo directing the Filipino offi
cials to aid the mission, but General
Trias,- commanding the Filipino forces
in the southern provinces, and his sub
ordinates declined to recognize Agui
naldo's authority-. The Spaniards re
fused to accept the invitations to land,
having been warned that they would be
held for ransom.
Major Rafael Morales, the former
Spanish Governor of the island of Min
doro, was brought on board the ship
for an interview. He was so weak that
he fainted and at parting he said:
"I shall never see you again."
The Filipinos thought the Red Cross
flas was the American flap:.
A committee, whose members are of
all the nationalities in Manila, headed
by John McLeod, an Englishman, has
been organized for the purpose of in
terviewing the Filipino leaders and pe
titioning for the release of the prison
ers in the name of humanity.

The President believes that this felicity
and perfection of the Philippine people is
to be brought about by the assurance of
peace and order; by the guarantee of civil
and religions liberty; by the establish
ment of justice, by the cultivation of let
ters, science and the liberal and practical
arts, by the enlargement or' Intercourse
with foreign nations; by expansion of in
dustrial pursuits: by trade and com
mence; by multiplication and improve
ment of the means of internal communi
cation; by internal development with the
aid of mechanical* inventions of the great
natural resources of the archipelago, and,
in a word, by the uninterrupted devotion
of the people to the pursuit of useful ob
jects and the realization of those nobits
ideas which constitute the higher civili
zation of mankind.
Unfortunately these pure aims and pur
poses of the American Government and
people have been misrepresented to some
of the inhabitants of certain islands, and
as a consequence the friendly American
force have, without provocation or cause,
been openly attacked. And why these hos
tilities? What do the best- Filipinos de
sire? Can it be more than the United
States is ready to give? They are patri
ots and want liberty.
In the meantime the attention of the
people of the Philippines is invitee! to cer
tain relative principles by which the
United States will be guided in its rela
tions with them. These are deemed to be
the points of cardinal importance:
1. The supremacy of the United States must
and will be enforced throughout every part of
the archipelago. Those Who resist can accom
plish nothing; except their own ruin.
2. The amplest liberty .of self-government
will be Kranted which is reconcilable with
just, stable, effective and economical adminis
tration and compatible with the sovereign
rights and obligations of the United Hiatts.
3. The civil rights of tht- Filipinos will be
guaranteed and protected, their religious freo
;red and all will have equal
standing before the law.
4. Honor, justice and friendship forbid the
exploitation of\the people of the islands. 'J i>>
purpose of the American Government is the
welfare and advancement of the Philiplne
people.
5. Guarantees an honest and effective civil
service, in which to the fullest Eente practi
cable natives shall be employed.
6. The collection and application of taxes
and other revenues will be put on a suun<!,
honest and economical basis. The public funds,
raised justly and collected honestly will be ap
plied only to defraying the proper â¢
the establishment and maintenance of the Phil
ippine Government and such general h-.;
menti as public interests demand. Liocal funds
â  â¢ i for local purposes shall noi â 
ed to other ends. With such prudent and hon
est fiscal administration it is- believed the needs
of the Government will in a short time become
compatible with a considerable reduction la
taxation.
7. The e=tabi.=hment of a pure, speedy and
effective administration of Justice by which the
evils :i and exploitations will
le effectually eradicated.
8. Th( construction of roads, railroads and
other means of communication and transporta
tion and other public wi.rks of manifest ad
vantage to the people will be promoted.
9. Domestic and foreign trade and commerce
and other industrial pursuits and the genera]
pment of the country in the
.Jits will be the constant obje ;s oX
solicitude and the fostering care.
10. Effective provision will he made for th^
establishment of elementary schools, in which
the children of. the people will be educated. Ap
propriate facilities will aiso be provided Tor
higher education.
11. Reforms in "all departments of Rovern
rr.fnt, all branches of the public service and all

of the people must be undertaken without de

WASHINGTON, April 4.â The State
I Department was notified to-day by a
! cablegram from Mr. Schurman, presi
i dent of the Philippi/ie Commission, that
| the expected proclamation "would be is
sued to-day. He said the document
â  would be about 1500 words in length.
Dr. Schurman says that after a
month's personal observation and in
terviews with different classes of peo
j pie he finds that the insurrection had
| its origin and strength in the Tagallo
j provinces around Manila. The remain
| ing provinces of North and South Lu
l zon are peopled by different races and
the rest of the archipelago are not na
tural allies of the Tagallot, but un
friendly rivals. During the months
while the treaty of peace was being
negotiated at Paris the Tagallos sent
detachments of from fifty to two hun
dred men to all the other provinces to
seize governments as robbers hold up
trains. The .liberty of the populations
was constrained and supremacy was
enforced, as there were no American
forces present to expel the Tagallos.
He says the recent victories have had
a good effect everywhere. With a

housing butlt on her, when she was
placed in the passenger trade, she
measured 215 tons gross and 137 net.
The Chilkat was originally put on the
Humboldt trade about five years ago,
running between San Francisco and
Eel River, but for the past two years
she has been exclusively engaged In
the trade with this port under, her late
captain, who succeeded Captain Dun
ham,
One report is that the Chilkat, which
was following the North Fork out, at
tempted to head her off and get started
down the coast first by taking a short
cut around the end of the south jetty,
instead of following out to sea before
turning "south.
This route at times Is practicable, but
when the bar is in the condition that it
was in to-day the short cut is extremely
dangerous and in this case it proved' a
faial undertaking for the little vessel.
Fortunate it was for those who were
saved that the people on the North
Fork were watching the Chilkat's peril
ous attempt, for immediately after the
Chilkat capsized Captain Basch of the
North Fork put his vessel about and
made for the wreck at full speed. In
the meantime boats were being cleared
away and manned so that when the
North Fork neared the wreck they cast
off. Upon receiving news of the dis
aster Agent Baird of the steamer dis
patched the tug Ranger and the ferry
boat Alta to the scene with physicians
and willing helpers. â¢
In the past ten years there have been
, numerous mishaps to vessels and sev
eral lives have been lost on Humboldt
bar, but this was the first wreck and
the first heavy loss of life there since
the schooner Fidelity turned over while
being towed in by the tug Printer on
November 16, 18S9. In this accident all
hands aboard the schooner were lost â
growth of a general feeling of security
the populations will doubtless declare
for the United States.
"The Philippine people," said Dr.
Schurman, "seem discouraged by the
valorous, swift and irresistible move
ments of the American troops, against
which their elaborate defensive works
were useless."
M'KINLEY DICTATED
THE PROCLAMATION
WASHINGTON, April 4.â The proc
lamation issued to the Filipinos by the
Philippine Commission was the only
important matter discussed at the Cab
inet meeting to-day.' The proclamation
was drafted by Chairman Schurman on
instructions from the President. When
the Philippine Commission was ap
pointed and before it left for Manila
a conference was held at the White
House between the members and Pres
ident McKinley. The commission was
then presented with written instruc
tions regarding the policy to be pur
sued in the administration of the isl
ands.
The official dispatch received by
Secretary Hay contained scarcely a
hundred words. The members of the
Cabinet, however, were presented with
a copy of the press dispatch and were
thereby enable to discuss the procla
mation in detail.
It is believed by the Cabinet officers
that the Filipinos are in a better state
of mind and are more ready to place
confidence in the American policy than
at any time since the insurrection be
gan. The natives are beginning to ap
preciate that Aguinaldo has been using'
them na a tool to further his personal
interests. This is shown, it is said, by
the number of deserters from his forces
and by the statements of his former
followers, who return to the American
lin^s and complain bitterly against the
treatment accorded them by him. The
insurgent leader's misrepresentations
as to the character of the American
people and the circulation of the idea
that any Filipino caught by them
would be immediately executed, and
his false reports of victories of Filipi
nos over the American forces, are now
beginning to be revealed.
It is the intention of the commission
to forward the proclamation to the
capitals of the various islands now un
der control of the American forces and
circulate it among the people, t is ex
pected the natives on the islands of
Negros and Cebu will immediately ac
cept the terms set forth in the procla
mation.
It can hardly be expected that there
will be any immediate results from the
proclamation. Secretary Hay stated,
but there is every indication that it
will ultimately bear fruit.
AMUSING MANIFESTO
FROM THE FILIPINOS
HONGKONG, April 4.â The Filipino
junta has issued another of the ex
traordinary statements which have
been features of the newspaper cam
paign directed from here by the agents
of Aguinaldo. In the present instance
the rebel agents claim to have obtained
their "information" from American
sources at Manila, They assert the ex
istence of "mysterious intrigues" be
tween the Vatican, Major General Wes
ley Merritt. President McKinley. Major
I S. Otis and Archbishop
Ireland, "leading to the latter's journey
to Rome." Continuing the Filipino
statement says:
The Paulist Fathers' actions prior to
the f n 1 1 of Manila were suspicious. Now,
in conjunction with Archbishop Nozal
edas, who Is intimate with General Otis,
they are endeavoring to procure the
former ascendance of the church in the
Philippines. Hence they are sustaining
Genera] Otis, who. as a Catholic, has re
fused to obey the Washington orders and
transfer the command of his force to
General Lawton, because he wishes to
r< main in power and assist the church
to recover its real estate. The Paulist
policy is more subtle than that of the
Jesuits, and unlf-ss they are promptly re
called they will work further mischief.
The Philippines are a valuable hunting
ground for the church, hence the Titanic
efforts to maintain its supremacy.
MAIL BOATS FROM SAN
FRANCISCO TO MANILA
WASHINGTON, April 4.â The Post
office Department is in correspondence
with several owners of steamships who
contemplate running a regular line of
boats from San Francisco to Manila. As
I soon as regular service is established
I a contract will be let and a schedule
' mail route established. At present
| transports have to be used for this
service. This occasions much delay in
the sending and receiving of mails.
eight men, including Captain Christo
pherson, his two mates, a cook and
four sailors. The vessel did not sink,
but, like the Chilkat, floated around on
the bar for some time, then went to
sea with the tide and finally came
ashore on the north peninsula back of
Fairhaven, where her bones lie buried
in the sand.
VIOLATED REDDING'S
FIRE ORDINANCES
REDDING, April 4.â A formal com
plaint was lodged in the Justice Court
here to-day against the directors of the
Armory Hall Building Association, the
charge being misdemeanor in having
failed to comply with the city ordinances.
The complaint was made out against E.
A. Reid, C. C. Bush Sr., Frank Lltsch,
John Doe, Richard Roe and Peter Snow.
Shortly after 5 o'clock this afternoon E.
A. .Reid, C. C. Bush Sr. and Frank Litsch
were placed under arrest. They appeared
before Judge Garden and were released
on their own recognizance. Next Monday
was fixed as the time for the setting o*f
the date of trial.
E. A. Reid and C. C. Bush Sr. are vice
president and cashier, respectively, of the
Bank of Shasta County. Frank" Lltsch is
a property owner and capitalist. All
are prominent citizens and well fixed
financially.
The trouble of which these arrests are
the outcome was precipitated by the ac
tion of the Board of City Trustees in at
tempting to enforce an ordinance pro
viding for stand pipes and hose in the
Armory Hall. The hall directors refused
to comply and the Trustees ordered ar
rests made if it were attempted to open
the hall to the public. As a last resort
the hall directors obtained an injunction
in the Superior Court and opened the hall
under cover of the court. City Attorney
Watson announces it as his intention to
prosecute the case vigorously, and i 3
backed by the entire Board of Trustees.
The trouble has excited widespread in
terest here, and the people have lined up
on one side or the other, as in a Presi
dential election.

BLOODY MUTINY
The Bark Port Adelaide
Is Lost.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 4.â Singapore
papers received yesterday report the
loss of the British bark Port Adelaide,
1400 tons burden, and registered at
Glasgow. She left Cheribbn, a Java
port, on the 23d of December, with 3000
piculs of sugar, for the Philadelphia
Breakwater, to await orders. Owing to
the weather sfce took the eastern route
to pass by Alias Straits. On the 7th
of February, at 2 a. m., she struck a
coral bank to the northeast of these
straits near the Postillion islands, and
remained fast.
In twenty-four hours' time six feet
of water stood in the hold. Upon this
the master. Captain Mac Donald, de
cided to abandon the vessel. The boats
were fully provisioned and the crew
left the sinking ship in three boats. On
the second day after leaving the ship
one of the boats reached a small coral
island, bare and uninhabited, where
they rested for a day and night. From
there they coasted along Sumbawa and
Lombok, until they reached Ambenan,
on the latter island, on February 15.
Ten days later they were rescued just
in the nick of time, for their food was
giving out, by the steamer Jacob,
which took them to Sourabaya.
The crew of this boat consisted of but
six sailors. There were no officers. The
two other boats, one of which contained
the master, chief officer, steward and
four sailors, and the other the second
officer, carpenter, cook and four sail
ors, are said to have been lost.
The Sourabaya rourant, in an article
dealing with the disaster, after express
ing surprise that no officers were in
charge of the fescued boat when it put
off from the wreck, alleges to have a
confession from two- of the rescued
sailors that they mutinied, and, after
scuttling the ship, fled in the boat, leav
ing the others unseaworthy by boring
holes in them. Other Java papers d<>
not credit this story.
Not one of the rescued sailors crruld
tell what course was taken or give de
tailed particulars of the. disaster, their
statements being most contradictory.

Russia Will Not Interfere With Sale
of Shares in That
Country.
NETV YORK. April 4.â lt was said to
day thru the sale of Zionist bank stock
had so far proven encouraging to the pro
moters. The bank is being organized to
promote the welfare of the Jews all over
the world, with a view to making Pales
tine their common country under the suz
erainty of the Sultan and the protection
of thR- European powers. It is further
intended to alleviate the sufferings of the
Jews now corral ed in the "pale of Rus
sia," and to encourage migration to the
East, where agriculture and every legiti
mate occupation will be encouraged by
the promoters of the enterprise.
More than 15,000 shares at â¬1 per share
have been subscribed in the United States
and twice that number are eventually ex
pected to be subscribed from this coun
try. In Chicago alone 2000 shares were

SALISBURY AGREES
TO GERMAN PLAN
Peaceful Settlement of
Samoan Question.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 4.â Lord
Salisbury has accepted the plan
proposed by Germany for the
settlement of the Samoan trouble
by the appointment of a tripar
tite commission. The acceptance
is .on the broad principle only,
and the details of the arrange
ment are yet to be agreed upon.
As the United States has already
accepted the general proposition
there is no longer any doubt as
to the organization of the com
mission.
WASHINGTON, April 4.â Dr. Wil
helm Solf, the newly appointed presi
dent of the municipal council of Sa
moa, had a busy day to-day conferring
with officials. Government and diplo
matic, and taking the preliminary steps
in the rapprochements of the three
governments concerning the islands.
Accompanied by Secretary Hay he was
received by the President, the latter
expressing the earnest hope that Dr.
Solf might be successful in his new
field of action. Later Dr. Solf called
at the British Embassy and a pleasant
t-xchange of views occurred. Assistant
Secretary of State Cridler also had a
meeting with Dr. Solf to go over some
of the technical details of the Samoan
question. These several conferences
were important mainly in showing the
harmony with which the officials of the
three governments are proceeding as
to Samoa.
During the day a representative of
the Associated Press saw Dr. Solf and
! talked with him on current Samoan af
fairs. He is a typical German, tall,
robust, florid, and speaks perfect Eng
lish, an accomplishment which will be
most helpful in dealing with the United
Slates and British representatives In
Samoa.
"I am glad to observe the most satis
factory feeling prevailing in Washing- j
ton," said Dr. Solf, "and I am confident
that the German and American author
ities would have little or no difficulty
in arriving at a -most harmonious un
derstanding on Samoa. As far as I am
concerned my duties are not of a po
litical character and my instructions,
received before leaving Berlin, are, in
effect, to use every endeavor to promote
! good feeling between the three powers
j and to avoid in every way possible
i cause for disagreement. Naturally, I
am desirous of realizing that high aim,
and of assisting in the quiet and orderly
i administration of Samoa."

CREEDON PROVES
WEST'S SUPERIOR
Referee's Decision Not
Approved.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 4.â The twenty
round bout between Dan Creedon of
Australia and Tommy West of this City,
which took place to-night in the arena
of the Lenox Athletic Club, was declared
a draw by the referee. West was lucky
in getting an even break, as Creedon was
certainly entitled to a favorable verdict.
Both men put up a very fast and game
contest, but Creedon's cleverness was so
pronounced that the majority of the on
lookers felt that the Australian was en
titled to a decision in his favor. The at
tendance was only fair. Creedon weighed
160 pounds and West 15S.
In the first round Creadon cut out the
work, landing hooks on the face and
neck, while West failed to land ef
fectively. In the second round West
sized up Creedon and landed hard several
times, Creedon, however, giving back as
good as h" got.
Round three was tame, but in ths
fourth both got blood. West's upper lip
being cut and Creedon' s nose respond
ing to a hard right. In getting away
from one of Creedon's rushes Wesl
his legs twisted and Creedon put him
on his back with a well-placed right on
the chest.
West cut loose in the next round and
forced the pace-, landing a right-hand
.^wine over the kidneys. Creedon sent In
a hard left on the face which made West
more cautious. In round six Creedon wad
cut over his left eye and bled freely.
Honors were even in round seven, but
in the next Creedon's repeated blows over
the eve forced West to hold and he was
cautioned by the referee. The next two
rounds were soft, but in the eleventh
West easily had the better of some hot
exchanges. In the succeeding round both
men did a lot of holding, and in the thir
teenth round several good exchanges were
made, but too light to do much damage.
Creedon forced matters in round four
teen, sending his left to the face. West
drove a stiff short arm right to the face.
Creedon hooked his left to West's face
and Tommy sent back a straight
left on the nose. A moment later Tommy
made Dan's head rock with a straight
left on the mouth. In the next round
West rushed, but Dan sent him back with

SAX .1 (BE, April 4.â Aristocratic ca
uincs from all over the coast have been
hopeful in spirit. When the posse left
town, this morning it rode in a wagon,
at the back of which was strapped a
; chair taken from Moore's cabin. Deputy
! Ashburn sat in this, facing backward,
j thus commanding a view on all sides.
The posse spent the entire day beating
through the underbrush on Federal
Loan ridge.
Speculation as to the murderer's
, whereabouts and his means of possible
esi ape absorbs conversation from one
'â  end of the county tv the other. Nearly
everybody agrees that Moore will not
make an attempt to go south. If the
lone desperado is game enough to at
tempt to push further east into the
snow-capped peaks of the Sierra
Nevada tie may possibly cheat for the
time being the justice that awaits him.
lid lie take to the old^lmmigrant
: ridge between Bear Valley and
this place and follow it through Steep
Hollow, passing through a thinly set
tied district, he might succeed in get
ting to the county line and into the
â¢ of Nevada. That seems to be
tlif only unguarded means of escape.
I This, however, would be a heart-break
ing and a perilous trip at this time of
the year, with the chances a thousand
to one against the man who attempted
\ it. The only sound theory that has
â  been advanced thus far seems to be
that of Under Sheriff Pascoe, who is
firm in the belief that the murderer is
sately tucked away in the mountains
by a friend.
"I have come to the conclusion that
Moore is being shielded by a friend, "
said Pascoe when he returned from the
hunt to-day. "Moore has a few friends
left in the mountains. He has resided
in this county twenty odd years and
knows the country like a book. I
strongly suspect that he is being housed
at night in some cabin in the v,
whence he could creep away at day
break and hide in the thick brush till
nightfall. Every cabin In the vicinity
has been thoroughly searched and its
owner closely questioned, but ail deny
all knowledge of the murderer's where
abouts. 1 still entertain strong hopes
that we will run across his trail to
morrow."
The excitement over Moore's success
ful efforts in baffling his pursuers in
creases daily. The citizens here await
with anxiety every day the return of
the searching parties and when they re
port one after the other lack of success
the gloom increases. There were more
man-hunters on Moore's trail to-day
than there have been at any time since
the murderer took to the woods, and
each succeeding day promises to bring
out others who have become enraged
at the ill-success of the lone bandit's
pursuers.
Moore is said to have a father living
in Oakland and some believe the mur
derer will attempt to go there for funds
should he be successful in making his
â¢ - ape from the mountains. In antici
pation of this Sheriff Getchell has tele
graphed to the Chief of Police of Oak
land requesting him to be on the look
out for the murderer.
An additional reward of $300 was of

people here are criticizing the Governor

In the name of the State, find making

convicted. The person who is lucky
enough to capture the desperate man
will never earn the State reward, for
the citizens here have vowed to judge
Moore in their own way â hang him tirst
and try him afterward. It is doubtful
if Moore will be brought to this town
alive. He knows the fate that awaits
him here, and if cornered will make his
last stand there and then.

BROOKS CAUSES A
PRIEST'S REMOVAL
HAVANA, April 4._itfo n siprnor Santnnder, Bishop of Havana, at the #
suggestion of Governor General Brooke, has removed a priest in Cabe- *

by the military administration in ecclesiastical affairs 0
Major General WUson, .Military Governor of "the Department of 2
Matanzas, wrote to headquarters that the priest in question was a X

that if the Bishop did not remove him he (General Wilson) would eject Â£

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1899.
HARRISON RE-ELECTED
MAYOR OF CHICAGO
CHICAGO, April 4.â Carter H. Har
rison was re-elected Mayor of Chicago
to-day by a total vote of 145,914, against
108,304 for Zina Carter, the Republican
candidate and 45.401 for John P. Alt
geld, the independent Democratic can
didate. Harrison's plurality is 39,610.
In the last Mayoralty election Harrison
was elected by a vote of 148,000, against
f>9,342 for Sears, the regular Republican
nominee, and 69,637 for Harlan, the in
dependent Republican.
The Democrats have elected their
candidates for the town offices in the
north and west towns, the Republicans
carrying the south towns, although the
final count may take this from them.
The returns at midnight, however, in
dicate that they have a safe majority.
The vote from the wards shows as far
as it has been counted that the Repub
licans have elected fourteen Aldermen
and the Democrats nine. The contest in
several of the wards is very close, and
the official count will probably be nec
essary to determine the result. The
City Council has been composed of
forty-five Democrats and twenty-three
Republicans, and the Democrats will
without doubt retain a working ma
jority.
The election was entirely upon local
issues, no element of national politics
entering into the campaign. The firm
stand taken by .Mayor Harrison against
the proposed tifiy-year extension of the
streetcar franchises was a strong ele
ment of his popularity and gained for
him many votes from the Republican
party, besides holding closely to him
many of the Democratic party who
might have cast ihelr votes for the in
dependent candidate. Another fact
th.it drew to him many Republican
votes was the existing opposition to
the Republican machine among the
rank and file of the Republican party.
Thousands of votes were cast for Har
rison that would have been received by
Carter, the Republican nominee, had
not the latter been backed by the ma
chine politicians. Several independent
and Republican papers supported Mr.
Harrison, among then) the Times-Her
aM and Post, which have been known
i as McKinley organs.
The election revealed some remark
! able changes in the Republican vote,
particularly in the strong Republican
wards, where the shifting to the Dem
ocratic candidate was very marked. In
the Third Ward, which has always
been a Republican stronghold, and in
which the Democrats were not able to
secure a candidate this year, so sure
LEGAL CONTEST
FOR A FORTUNE
Famous Murdock Case
Comes to a Trial.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, April 4.â The celebrated
M unlock case came up for trial this
afternoon and the work of empaneling
the jury began. Only three talesmen
examined, but no jurors were
sworn. At least a week will be con
sumed in getting a jury. The courtroom
was crowded, many women being
present.
William Murdock. a wealthy rancher of
Glenn County, residing near Willows,
died about the Bth day of January, 1594.
He was unmarried, and left an estate val
ued at upward of $300,000. After the pro
bate of his estate was commenced a claim
was presented by Mary Helen Murdock,
wife of one of the large ranch owners in
that section, for $100,000 and a large
amount of Interest. The claim was based
on a promissory note for $100,000, dated
mber 5, IMT. payable twenty years
after date and bearing Interest at 1 pt-r
c .Hi a month, and purporting to have
signed by William Murdock. The
note was as follows:
1100,000. OLIMFO, Sept. 5, 1577.
Twenty years after date I promise to pay to
the order 'if Mary Helen Murdock the sum of
erne hundred thousand dollars ($100,000), with in
terest at th.^ rate of 1 per <-*^r.t ; ..-r month until
paid, principal and interest payable In T'nltcU
States gild coin. WILLIAM MI'RIKm k.
The attorneys representing the esi
were loud in their denunciation of the
note, and attempts were made to show by
affidavits published In the newspapers
that William Murdock never signed the
note nor had any occasion to sign a note
for that amount. The executors, strange
ly enough, while protesting that th
was not genuine, never acted on the
claim, alleging In the papers filed that
they did not do so because they did not
know whether it was genuine or not. They
have never up to this time Mthar rejected
or allowed the claim. It was currently
reported at that time that one of the
executors had remarked that the note
w;is pen ul no and "had Bill Murdock lived
.: v. â¢ .-k longer it would have been settled."
When the executors failed to act on the
claim suit was begun by the claimant to
establish the validity of the note. It was
found that the action was prematurely
brought, so it was dismissed. Immediate
ly after the note became due the present
suit was commenced in accordance with
the probate law, which provided that
suits upon claims not due when presented
must be commenced within two months
after the claim becomes due. The note
fell due on September .". 1897.
Ip to this time no word had come from
the claimant regarding the history of the
note, she biding her time apparently until
she had her 'lay in court. Hut during the
course of the litigation the executors
took Mrs. Murdock's deposition and the
real consideration of the note was made
public for the first time.
It appeared from the deposition tha

was the party of defeat, Harrison re
ceived a majority of 51. In the last
Mayoralty election this ward cast a
total of 3428 Republican votes, divided
between Sears, the regular Republican
nominee and Harlan, the independent
Republican candidate, against 2524 for
Harrison. To-day the Republican can
didate for Town Treasurer received in
this ward 3447 votes, against 2389 for
his Democratic competitor.
The Fourth Ward cast two years ago
3967 Republican votes, against 2922 for
Harrison. To-day it elected a Republi
can Alderman by a majority of 1800
and Harrison carried it by a plurality
over Carter of 611. In various other
wards in this city, a like result was
shown, there being a strong Republi
can slide toward Harrison, many of
the wards which gave him strong ma
jorities returning Republican candi
dates for Aldermen.
The election was one of the most
quiet that the city ha? over experi
enced. There were rumors of comlne:
trouble in the First and Eighteenth
Wards, where the Republicans claimed
they had secured positive evidence of
"colonizing" on the part of the Demo
crats, but th matter came to nothing
and there were no difficulties to speak
of. Several arrests were made, one
man, Robert Ferguson, having in his
possession before coming to the polls
a marked official vote. He informed
the police that he had received it from
Timothy O'Connor, a Republican poli
posed by his son Gawn. and was the cause
of frequent quarrels between father and
eon. Between Samuel and his daughter
in-law, the claimant, the best feeling al
ways prevailed, and Samuel was espe
cially fond of his two grandchildren.
This situation culminated in 1876 with a
dissolution of partnership between Gawn
and his father, Gawn paying the father a
large sum of money, which was turned
over to William. Shortly after this Wil
liam induced Samuel to leave his son's
house and to demand more money under
threats of a lawsuit, William claiming
that Gawn had not paid Samuel enough
in the settlement. To avoid trouble Gawn
paid his father $20,000 more. Samuel then
came back to the house, and on the day
the note was made William Murdock
came to the ranch and he and Samuel had
a settlement. A balance of the amount I
due Samuel from WilHam was struck and
the note in question was made, payable to i
his daughter-in-law, for the benefit of the
two grandsons. He had it made pay
able twenty years after date, so that it
would fall due about the time the boys be
came of age. Samuel did not want his
son Gawn to handle any of his money.
The note was carefully preserved and now
Is exciting most intense interest through
out the whole northern part of the State.
The executors claim thai several
months before his death William Murdock
heard of the note and instituted an in
quiry as to its holder. It Is claimed that
those around him avoided letting Mrs.
Murdock know of his serious illness, evi
dently being fearful that she would call
and see him. She was not even notified
of his funeral.
The defense urged against this note is
that it is a forgery.
The plaintiff is represented by Cannon
& Freeman, attorneys of this city, and
Charles L. Donohoe of Willows, and the
defense by F. C. Lusk of Chico, Richard
Bayne, E. S. Pillsbury and W. H. L.
Barnes of this city, and others.
FLOW OF NATURAL
GAS NEAR WHITTIER
LOS AXGET.ES, April 4.â Tn an en
deavor to develop water for irrigation on
the KiOO-aere ranch of Mathias Meyers at
the Santa Fe Railroad station near Whit
tier an unexpected How of natural gas
was encountered that, according to re
ports, exceeds in volume anything of like
character known in this part of the State.
J. M. Quigglo. who has the work in
charge, says that a depth of 375 feet
the drill struck a strata of rock. An un
derground explosion took place, throwing
water, sand and rock t" the surface. The
water was forced four fret above the
collar of the Standpipe, while rooks, some
weighing twenty pounds, shot high into
the air. Two more explosions followed,
hurling U P more sand than other matter.
When the water subsided a flow of air
i aroused speculation among those who had
been attracted by the unusual spectacle.
I Quiggle applied a torch to the vapor,
which instantly ignited. On Sunday the
flame was extinguished by Quiggle's. son,
I who fired the contents of a shotgun

tician, and the latter was arrested.
Mayor Harrison declared himself to
night as being greatly pleased with the
result of the election, saying:
"It shows that the people of Chicago
are pleased with the administration
and I am glad of that, for I honestly
endeavored to give them the best ad
ministration I could. The result shows
for itself."
Mr. Carter, the Republican candi
date, said:
"I do not take the Harrison victory
to be a rebuke to the Republican party.
Indeed I think that national issues
were not in the minds of the people
when they cast their ballots â simply
the idea was uppermost that Carter H.
Harrison was alone to thank for de
feating the attempt at long term fran
chises and that a re-election was due
to him as a reward for that act. Per
.-onally, I have no regrets over the re
sult."
The suburb of Austin was annexed to
the city of Chicago as a result of the
election. This will add 11,500 to the
population of Chicago.
John P. Altgeld said of the result of
the election to-night:
"One reason for the election of Mr.
Harrison was that the press supported
him almost without exception, and the
great Republican papers were on his
side. Why did the Republican papers
support Harrison? The reason is not
hard to find. They saw that Mr. Har
rison had already betrayed the Demo
cratic party, as he had it in his power
to do, and he will carry the betrayal a
great deal farther and thus make the
re-election of McKinley a certainty.
Thr> Republicans look on this fight as
the first battle of 1900 and feel that the
re-election of Mr. Harrison already
seals thÂ« result of the next Presidential
campaign."

POMONA, April 4.â The workers at
the North Pomona Orange Packing
House were startled at 2 o'clock this
afternoon at seeing the engine of the
westbound California limited from
Chicago break loose from the tender
and go dashing down the track, with
a broken side rod flying wildly about.
The tender jumped the rails, followed
by the baggage and dining cars, which
were badly demolished. The oranee
men rushed to the assistance of pas
sengers and train men. Fortunately
none were killed and but three injured.
Porters W. J. Lee and Joe Battles suf
fered broken ribs and News Agent C.
B. Miller a broken ankle.
The cause of the wreck was the
breaking of a casting which support

came free it separated the tender from
the engine and tore a hole through the
boiler. The steam came pouring out
and Engineer Nevin and Fireman
Wells jumped back of the deck for

respondent Conductor Ilickson said he
first felt a terrific grating jar. Then
his car was overturned and he was
thrown under a seat, but escaped with
a bruised shoulder.
Pullman Conductor Connell reported
only fifteen passengers on his list.
Four sleeping cars were half derailed
and badly wrenched. The observation
car remained on the track. A section
in one of the sl.epers was pierced by
a long rail, which tore throuch the
floor. As far as San Rernardino the
section was occupied by Capitalist

left the car at San Bernardino.
H. H. Vincent, the local Santa Fe
agent, wont immediately to the scene
of the wreck and was active in at
tending to the wants of the r>assen
gers. He telegraphed to Los Anereles
and made arrangements for all to be
taken thither by a local train. A
wrecking crew is now working at
North Pomona and the tracks will be
cleared for to-morrow's traffic. While
this will prove a costly wreck for the
Santa Fe, it is fortunate that it oc
curred upon a sandy roadbed. Had it
occurred on hard ground the cars
would have piled upon one another and
loss of life would have been inevitable.

DOCTORS AGREE
THAT THE BEEF
WAS EMBALMED
General Miles Has Already Made
Out a Strong Case Before
the Court of Inquiry.
WASHINGTON, April 4.-The
Army Court of Inquiry to-day
again heard Dr. Daly In re
' gard to the character of beef
furnished to the army during
the late war. He reiterated
his former statements, paid his respects
to the "War Commission and declared that
the refrigerator beef smelt like a cadaver
after It had been embalmed.
Dr. Nicodemus of Philadelphia, who paw
service In Porto Rico, corroborated this
testimony, comparing the smell of the
beef to the odor about a dissecting-room.
The day brought out a proposition from
General Miles to supply the court with the
names of a large number of witnesses
nd that he had in February offered the
official reports of 147 officers as testimony,
â¢ but that the court had not indicated Its
acceptance of them.
Dr. William P. Daly was the first wit
ness to-day. He was medical member of
General Miles' staff in Porto Rico, and
had previously testified before the court
and was recalled to complete his testi
mony then begun. Dr. Daly's testimony
dealt especially with the beef supplied
to the army. He had, he said, made suf
ficient observations to warrant him in
submitting an official report, and after
that time he ha I made an analysis which
had confirmed his suspicions as , to the
meat. His first observations had been
made on a transport at Tampa before the
sailing of it" expedition to Santiago. Dr.
Daly again detailed :}â¢_- particulars of the
trip north on the transport Panama,
which was In his charge, last September.
Dr. Daly took occasion to pay his re
spects to the Alger War Commission, be
fore which he had appeared. He said the
commission 1 had given out the impression
that the deterioration of the beef on the
Panama was due to want of ice. This
was contrary to his testimony and the
truth could easily have been ascertained.
As a matter of fact, the Panama had an !
excellent refrigerator, and it carried ten
tons of Ice to one of beef. He also re
ferred to the criticism in the War Com- 1
mission of his use of the expression in '
his report that the smell about the beef
was like the odor of boric acid. He said:
It is as difficult to say what a smell 1? like
us It Is for an artist to paint a dying groan.
It the phrase â¢was offensive I might have
adopted the language of the soldiers, some of
whom said It "smelt like the devil," while
others compared it to the bouquet of a cess
pool.
Mr. Daly Bald he had since made ex
periments upon beef subjected to treat
ment by boric ncid, and found it gave
forth about as foul a smell as could be
Imagined.
Major Lee then read various reports
made by Dr. Daly concerning official in
spections of the beef at the camps at
Jacksonville, Lexington and Chickamauga
as follows:
Tho meat used generally looked well, but
there was a universal complaint of its smelling
badly. He had found tho fresh beef to be ap
parently preserved by the injection of some
chemical which destroyed its natural flavor
and which must of necessity have been inju
rious to the health of those oatine It. It was
to his mind impossible to preserve the meat
without the use of acid and apparently the
meat had been preserved "by the Injection of
chemicals to aid the work ot defective cold
storage."
In one ran* he had found the odor similar to
that of â  dead human body and in another,,
rpeaklnjr of the odor, he said: "It was unnat
ural, mawkish, something like that of a hu
man cadaver after an undertaker had injected
Ills emlialminir preservative."
He was satisfied that the beef had been chem- j
ically preparedâ that it had been embalmed, in I
fact.
After his reports nnd gone In. In order to j
satisfy his own mind; he made chemical analy- :
Bis of the residuum of the beef used in the '
camps.Un and had found evidences of the boric â¢
and salicylic acids.
Major Lee referred to the report of the
War Commission in which reference had
been made to the use of those drugs, the
Intimation Ing that a trace of them
would not be injurious.
Replying. Dr. Daly asserted that the
chemicals were detrimental to health and
they could only be used at the peril of
those taking them. He said-
No matter what authority says these chem
icals are safe, they are not safe. I would like
to Introduce a Joint report made by Dr. Clark, !
chief chemist, and Dr. Hildehrandt, chemist
of the Geological Purvey, on an analysis made
by them of the residuum from the beef used
on the Panama. In this report th( said they
bad examined the powder furnished by Dr. :
Paly. "Both the flame test and the turmeric
paper test gave distinct evidence of the pres
ence of boric acid." they said. "We also ob
tained good reactions with ferric chloride,
showing the presence of salicylic acid." â¢
In response to a general question Dr. !
Daly said he had come into much infor
mation confirmatory of what he had tes
tified to, hut which had come to him in a
confidential way. rendering It Improper for
him to give the names of those supplying:
the facts.
In truth, a ban had boon placed upon the
information. Hi thought thai some forty
or fifty persons had spoken to him in
eorroboration of what he had said. These
were the proprietors of slaughtering
houses and the manufacturers of chemi
cals. One manufacturer had told him
that he would have been compelled to go
out of business but for the patronage of
the beef men. He said after some Ques
tioning that he would ascertain whether
he could give the names of these people '
to the court.

he had' made his first observation at
Tampa In response to Colonel Weston'a
:k to the effect that any chemical
had been used on the beef which the colo
nel had hung in the sun. He said he had
rved the specimen from the beef on
the Panama, locking It up in a bottle in a
portmanteau. He had given the specimen
no treatment except to remove the fat by
Ing through raw cotton.
Asked if he was still a? much convinced
as when ho made his report of the quality
of the beef, he said: "I am stronger in
my convictions than I ever was from the
unsolicited evidence that has come to me

Or. Edwin 1. Nicodemua of Philadelphia,

testified that both the canned roast and
refrigerator beef was very unsatisfactory.
The latter beef on the transport Missis
sippi was Buggestivo of the dissecting
room, the odor bi Ing characteristic of an
limed body. Sonic of the men after
eating it had manifested symptoms of
ptomaine poisoning. He Inferred that the
had undergone chemical treatment,
because the taste and smell were different
from the normal ta.ste and smell of meat.
SHAFTER GOES EAST
TO ASSIST EAGAN
Tn obedience to a most unexpected and
rather mysterious dispatch from the As
sistant Secretary of War, General Shafter
left last night for Washington to appear
a.s a witness before the court of Inquiry,
which is now investigating the charges
preferred by General Miles against the
b-ef furnished the army by Commissary
General Eagan. The dispatch was from
Schwan, assistant adjutant general, and
directed that General Shafter should re
port in person to the court immediately.
General Shafter lefc at 6 o'clock last
night, accompanied by his aid, Captain
B. H. Plummer of the Tenth United States
. Infantry. The two officers went by the
> way of Ogden and will reach Washington
en Sunday night. There are several facts
connected with the summoning of General
Shatter as a witness that tend to show
that. Alger is playing a last desperate
in his efforts to upset the evidence
; that Miles has brought before the court,
1 and that General Eagan was recently re
i called from this city to Washington is
thought by some to be the reason of Gen
ual Shatter being .summoned.
When General Eagan was here he had
an Interview with G< after. It is
known that General Shatter's evidence
will be in favor of Alger. Captain I'lum
mer, his aid, Btated yesterday to a repre
: â  Call that General Shatter
found the beef furnished his com-
Uined and fresh, to be in
g i condition. He said:
"The fresh beef furnished General Shaf
.illy was good, for 1 myself at->
it. and also thai which was canned. On
â  casion some fresh beef was report
ag unfit to be served, and Gen
fter ordered a board of survey,
which condemned it. This particular beer
had been out in the rain. It was the only
that was furnished the Fifth Army
Corps that was not good, and it was
spoiled by careless:..-.-. We know that
tbe soldiers got tired of eating the c
bet f, bin there was nothing the matter
With it. Of course 1 cannot speak for the
ibat was sent to Porto Rico, but
sent to Sib. nej was good, only re
cently a sergeant came to department
headquarters to we General Shufter. He
had been a cook for erne of the brigade
headquarters in Cuba, and he said that
. he had been ordered not to us. the canned
but that he had done bo, and that
he had fixed it up and s rved it to tho
officers, and that they had eaten it with
out knowing the difference. This man
wanted General Shatter to have him ap
re the court of inquiry."
In speaking of General Shatter's sum
- to Washington Captain I'lummer
said:
"The dispatch is a great surprise to us.
General Shatter had no idea of being sum
moned as a witness. Only a short while
ago the court of inquiry met in Omaha.
Naturally the general thought that ii lie
was to be a witness he would bave been
summoned at that time, l know from
what General Shatter will testify con
cerning the beef that his testimony will
certainly he In favor of Alger and Gen
eral Eagan. The general will be absent
from the department about, two weeks."
The circumstances seem to indicate that
Alger has just found out that Shatter's
testimony may help his cause, and that
Algor only found this out through General
Eagan, This is the general opinion around
nd it is needless to say
that this opinion is expressed Bub rosa.
When the court was recently at Omaha
Genera] Shatter was not thought of, al
though he could have appeared at that
time with less detriment to the affairs of
Ctment. As is known, General
.n hnd a conference with General
Shatter when he was here, and when he
returned to Washington be was also in
â¢â¢nee with Alger. On top of this
comes the summons (or 'General Shatter
to appear before the court of Inquiry, and
the f.trÃnge fact In the case is that Alt^ r
ia in no apparent way connected with th>>
dispatch. General Shatter's testimony
will be Important, and it is thought by
some that Alger hopes to use it success
fully against that already placed before
the court by General Miles.

WELL-KNOWN
SHIP CAPTAIN
DISAPPEARS
Last Seen on Oakland
Ferry Boat.
CAPTAIN ANKERS IS MISSING
HAS NOT BEEN HEARD FROM
SINCE LAST FRIDAY.
Sailors' Wages Advanced $5 a Month.
Terry Steamer Berkeley Does
More Damage at the
Union Depot.
Captain George Ankers of the three
masted schooner Oceania Vance Is miss
i ing, and his friends fear that he has lost
his life in the waters of the bay. The
vessel arrived here from Honolulu last
Thursday with a load of sugar, and an
chored In the stream. On Friday morning
j Captain Ankers was on his way to the
| tugboat office to get a boat to take the
Vance to Long wharf, Oakland. He
I chatted with Sergeant Mahoney of tho
, Harbor police for a while and then went
to the tug- office at the foot of Vallejo
street. The schooner was moved to Oak
land, but the captain did not go in his
vessel. He was not seen again during the
course of the day, but at night v\\s spoken
j to on the Oakland ferry-boat by two of
j the employes of J. R. Hanify & Co.,
i agents of the Oceania Vance. Captain
' Ankers had his dinner on the ferry-boat,
I and said he was going to his vessel. That
was the last time he is known to have
been seen. His wife and family in Mill
Valley are almost distracted over his dis
! appearance, and the agents of the vessel
I do not know what to make of It, but fear
the worst.
Captain Ankers was all right when seen
on the ferry steamer by the employes of
| Hanify & Co. He did not have much
| money on him, hut curried a small hand
Batchel, which Mr. Hanify thinks might
j have given robbers an idea that he had
j with him the money to pay the crew.
| Long wharf Is always crowded with rail
read cars iuiil is only hall planked. It is
in consequence a very dangerous place
to navigate, especially at night. The
general supposition is that the captain
made a misstep and fell through the
wharf, striking his head against a pile
as he wenl down. The Oceania Vance
came over from Oakland and docked at
the seawall yesterday. Captain Murchi-
I son of the barkentine Uncle John has
; taken command of her and will sail her
: to 1 [onolulu.
r ! '!ir missing man was one of the best
! known masters In San Francisco. He was
: brought up In the employ of; the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, and a year or
so ago was master of the San Juan in
the Panama trade. During his last .voy
age his steamer went ashore, but got off
without any damage. There is a rule in
th< Mail Company, however, that a cap
tain whose vessel meets with an accident
that might have been avoided loses his
position; so Captain Ankers had to seek
another place. He was a splendid navi
gator and a thorough seaman, and there-
Pore had no dlJfficuTty in securing a com
mand. He took the Oceania Vance from
here to Australia with a load of lumber,
i coal at Newcastle, N. S. YV. , for
Honolulu, and from the latter port
brought siiprar here. He had not received
his pay nor were his accounts with the ;
agents Bettled up, but everything has
been since overhauled and found to be
correct to a cent.
Coasting saliors are jubilant. Wng*>s

Tahiti vessels and all traders to the
southern seas, so that over a thousand
Bailors will be benefited by ti.e advance.
During the winter months all the BUgar
with the exception of the Bpreckela
and Willlams-Dimond vessels paid $25 a
month, the exceptions named paying $30
until last month, when the rate was made â 
$25 all around. When the vessels that
made the cut come back they will have :
to pay the old rate. Commencing with '
! the 15th inst., all sailors on vessels load- j
Ing at bar harbors will get J: 1 .."), on vessels
loading in roadsteads $40 and on vessels ;

These rates will apply to steam schooners, i

water front, and all classes of people nre ;
pleased in consequence. The advance was
made at a meeting of the b-ipowners'

BULLETS SANG A
SONG OF FREEDOM
Under Heavy Fire Private Ardrew Miller
Flees the Presidio Guardhouse.
THE sharp bark of a rapidly handled Krag-Jorgensen rendered reveille
unnecessary at the Presidio yesterday morning and the whole camp
was wakened to find that one of Its most important prisoners had fled
the guardhouse to the thick brush on the side hill, having nothing but
the still hanging smoke from the sentry's rifle to indicate the course he
had taken.
The deserter was Private Andrew Miller, so called, of Troop M of the
Fourth Cavalry. Miller was placed under arrest two months ago on charges
of desertion and fraudulent enlistment. Shortly after he had enlisted with the
troop a woman about town called at the headquarters of Post Adjutant Har
ris and Informed him that Miller had previously deserted from Company D of
th'^ Fifteenth infantry, stationed at Fort Bayard, N. M. She said that
Miller had confessed this much to her since he had re-enlisted and stated
further that his right name was Brown and that it was under that name he
had deserted his New Mexican regiment.
Orders for Miller's arrest were at onco issued and he was confined in the
post guardhouse until yesterday morning, when he made a daring leap
through the door, and risking a chance of three ill-directed shots from the
riile of Sentry Calchrist, who was on guard at the time, lost himself in the
heavy undergrowth on the hill sides of the reservation.
The cavalry patrol was at once ordered out and all day long occupied it
self at beating up the brush for the deserter, but with no success. Miller
was as much lost to the reservation as though he had taken the other route
and attempted to ford the Golden Gate. Bunk mates of Miller's said he had
told them that he had a suit of civilian clothes and $100 in cash stowed away
under a copse back of the guardhouse and it is the opinion of the officers at
the post that he has got hold of his belongings and is by this time well out of
the city.

MATE DOUGLASS GETS
A LIGHTER SENTENCE
HIS LICENSE SUSPENDED FOR
FOUR MONTHS.
Inspector Bermingham of the Opin
ion That He Was One Third
More to Blame Than
Captain Clairville.
Captain John Bermingham, Supervising
Inspector of Hulls and Boilers for the
Northern District of Calffornia, rendered
a decision yesterday in the case of the
appeal of James W. Douglass, chief offi
cer of the ferry steamer Oakland, from
the sentence imposed Upon him by the
local inspectors, Captains Bolles and
Bulger, which had suspended his license
for twelve months from March 3 of this
year, for his negligence in allowing
the ferry-boat to run down the gasoline
launch William D on the afternoon of
January 22. On that occasion the launch
was sunk and two of its occupants were
drowned.
< a;. tain Hermingham In rendering his
decision said that he agreed with the
local board that Douglass was neglect
ful and unskillful in the discharge of his
duties on that occasion, trut that he was
not more so that the pilot of the Wil
liam p. The decision expressed the opin
ion also that Captain Clairville of the
Oakland, on turning over the wheel to :
ass after leaving the ferry did not
in any way relieve himselt 01 the respon
sibility of the navigation of the Oakland.
II. â  was the muster and pilot in charge
made her landings, and had full author
ity over tht- appellant, hut his neglect of
duty in no way justified the appellant In
neglecting his duty. Douglass was not
much more responsible for the collision
than was Captain Clairville. whose
license an master and pilot was suspend
ed by the locnl hoard for three months
for negligence and inattention to nis
duties on that occasion.
In the opinion of Captain Bermingham
the penalties Imposed on the two omc< ra
by the local board were disproportionate.
Thereto: the penalty Imposed upon '
Doucasa is modified to the suspension
ofyGs license as master and pilot for the
tx:m of four months from March 3.
HEART PARALYSIS.
Disease That Ended the Life of D. G.
Alexander Ascertained by an
Autopsy.
An autopsy was held yesterday by sev

L. Rlgdon represented the Pacific Mu
tual, Dr. S. S. Stratton and Dr. Theodore i
Palmer were present on behalf of the
f;iniily of the deceased and Autopsy Sur
geon Zabala attended on behalf of the
Coroner.
Th<- reason assigned for the conclave of 'â¢
doctors was that the deceased had taken !
out a policy of insurance for $3000 in the
Connecticut Company about four months
ago, and also held a policy for $1000 in the
Pacific Mutual.
The cause of death was found to hay*
been paralysis of the heart. The stomach

ANCIENT ORDER
OF THE UNITED
WORKMEN MEETS
Representatives From
All Sections.
GRAND LODGE DEGREE GIVEN
AMENDMENTS OFFERED AND
REJECTED.
Those Who Commit Suicide Within
a Certain Period to Lose Fixed
Rightsâ The Competi
tion for a Prize.
The delegates to the Grand Lodge of the
Ancient Order of United Workmen of the
State of California, who represent nearly
20,900 of the citizens of this State, met
yesterday in Native Sons' Hall in twen
ty-second annual session. These repre
sentatives numbered nearly three hun
dred and they and the grand officers were
called to order by Grand Master Judgft
George H. Bahrs, after which the Grand
Lodge degree was conferred on one hun
dred and fifty past masters, who had be
come such since the previous session of
the grand body.
The greater portion of the forenoon ses
sion was taken up in the seating of the
members upon the reading of the report
of the committee on credentials, after
which the reports of the grand officers
were presented and submitted to the com
mittee on distribution.
The report of the grand master shows
that during the year 3405 applications for
membership were received, of which 2404
were initiated, and that with 379 deaths
and a number of suspensions the order
had a net gain of 373. Ten new lodges
were instituted and six lodges were con
solidated with other lodges. Eleven
lodges surrendered their charters. There
were but three appeals to the grand mas
ter in the year.
In;ring the year IR9B it appears from the
report of Grand Recorder Poland there
were presented 300 death claims at $2000
each and 14 at $1000 each, making an ag
gregate of $734,000 for the benefit of
widows and orphans.
J. Wells was appointed grand over
seer, vice J. H. Flint, who is in the Klon
dike country.
During the past two months a member
of the order, who will be a candidate for
one of the grand offices, distributed a
circular announcing his candidacy, and
that brought forth a resolution which was
adopted by a large vote denouncing such
practice. Several other resolutions were
presented and passed to the proper com
mittees.
In the matter of several lodges that
were delinquent as to per capita tax
I pledges for the payment of the same were
acÂ« epted and the representatives c
I while In two cases the tax was remitted
because of the membership having on Re
count of the drought been In financial
straits. Three lodges had representatives
| debarred because they had not been elect
ed according to law.
At the afternoon session the report of
; the committee on laws and amendments
took up a gn>at deal of time in the con
sideration of amendments. One. reducing
the tine from three to one month when
j a suspended member could be rein
without examination by the medical ex
aminer, was lost; one providing for the
payment by the lodges of the dues and
assessments of members who had passe '
the ape of 60 and had been in the order
ten years or more, if they were In indi
f< at circumstances, upon pledging their
certificate with the recorder of the lodge,
was lost; one to allow the grand master
workman three deputy grand master
workmen instead of one was indefinitely
postponed; one providing- that if a mem
ber commits suicide within two years af
ter joining, except In delirium caused by
ie, or while under treatment for in
. or after a judicial declaration of
Ity, his beneficiaries shall receive
only the amount he paid into the benefl
fur.d. was carried; one to make the
Siat.' Lodge constitution conform to the
Supreme constitution as to liquor dealers
was carried; and one to increase the fee
of the grand medical examiner from 25 to
50 cents for certificates was lost.
The consideration of the other amend
ments was postponed until this morning
:he Grand Lodge adjourned to the
corner of Post and Mason streets, where
the members were photographed in a
body
In the evening there were many of the
representatives present to witness the
contest for a prize of $100 offered to the
lodge team that made the greatest aggre
gate of points in the ritualistic work, se
crei work and floor work. The competing
teams were Mount Hamilton of San Jose,
Prosperity of San Francisco, Fresno of
Ksno and Capitol of Sacramento. Each
good work, but the prize went to the
ramento team, which won with L' 1 -?

BOXING BOUTS AT THE
SAN FRANCISCO CLUB
DEANE AND BAKER FOUGHT
EIGHT HARD ROUNDS.
William Granfield Stopped Wrestler
Walter Daly in a Hot Bout
That Ended in the Third
Round.
The Kan Francisco Athletic Club gave
a boxinc entertainment last evening
which continued until a late hour. The
ire of the programme was an eight
round contest between (leorge Baker of
Salt Lake, l"/t pounds, and Jack Deane,
the champion of the dub. The bout was
one nf the cleanest and best that the
members have seen for many monrhs.
Deane's style of fighting was for the
body, while Baker devoted his attention
to the face. The first round ended In fa
vor of Baker, who landed several hard
lefts on Deane's face. In the second
staggered Baker with a hot left
on the jaw. but the Salt Lake man re
turned tli" compliment by planting sev
eral lefts on Deane's nose. The boxers
then mixed things up and In this style
Deane had certainly the best of the
game. Deane had a shade the better of
this ro'ind.
The inird round was a stand-off. The
fourth ended in Deane's favor. The fifth
was evenly contested. The sixth was
Deane's because of the number of body
blows he landed on Baker. In the sev
enth and eighth Bak^r scored a strong
lead* and doubtless would have whipped
his opponent if the limit had been twelve
rounds instead of eight, as Deane was
showing signs of distress. The referee.
Jack Leahy, called the match a draw,
which decision was right.
Charley Vlckers defeated Ed Coyne In
a six-round bout.
Charley Thurstop go.t a decision over
William Condon, notwithstanding that
Condon clearly proved his superiority on
points and clean hitting.
"Kid" Johnson easily bested William
Meehan in a tivc-mund bout.
A. Granfield defeated "Kid" McDonald
in a four-round go.
William Granfleld fought three hard
rounds with Walter Daly, the wrestler,
who. it is said, was instrumental in whip
ping a pogr old drunk recently, but was
stopped by 'iranfield. who interfered In
behalf of the Inebriate. Daly challenged
Grnntleld. and they had it out last night.
Sufficient to say that (Jranlield made a
chopping-blo< k of Daly, and the contest
was Btopped in the third round when
Granfield had l>aly all but out.

STOCK OF THE
GAS COMPANY
IS NOT LISTED
A Sharp Decline in
Prices Expected.
SMALL SHAREHOLDERS SAVED
RADICAL ACTION OF STOCK AND
BOND EXCHANGE.
Officials of the Lighting Company
Will Fight the Proposed Re
duction of Rates by the
Supervisors.
The shares of the San Francisco Gas
j and Electric Company were not listed at
the Stock sand Bond Exchange yesterday.
This action was taken, the officers of the
exchange affirm, to prevent a panic In
lighting stock and the injury of the small
shareholders, of whom there are several
thousand in this 'city.
It is one seldom resorted to. Thepricesof
shares were affected noticeably by the an
nouncement of the incorporation of the In
dependent Electric Light and Power Com
pany last Wednesday. The stock dropped
off several points, going down from 88 to
75. On top of this came the radical action
of the Supervisors reducing the price of
gas to private consumers from $1 75 per
', thousand feet to $1 10. The brokers knew
there could .be but one result when the
public became informed of the cut in
rates. The reduction in rates meant a
corresponding reduction in price of stock
! consequent upon the efforts to unload be
fore the bottom dropped out of the mar
ket.
The officials of the exchange decided to
drop the gas stock from me securities
listed until they learned what the com
pany Would do to protect the interests of
the shareholders. A committee was ap
pointed, consisting of Jacob Barth, J. R.
K. Nut tall and Henry St. Hoar, to visit
President Crockett and learn what stand
the gas company would take. Mr.
Crockett informed the committee that his
associates expected Mayor â Phelan to veto
the order of the Supervisors on the
ground that the rate fixed would not al
low the company reasonable profit on the
capital Invested in its plant. Should the
Mayor sign the order the committee was
assured that the matter would.be taken
at once to the courts for adjustment.
The committee was further informed
1 that the officials of the gas company be
lieve the contracts made with the city
1 last July are valid. Judge Sea well' a re
cent decision to the contrary notwith
standing. The company expects to col
lect the full amount of the bills.
The committee reported on its Investl
-1 gation with the result that the stock was
listed during the afternoon session of the
, board. A number of sales were made,
the price fluctuating between $71 and $72.
The price on Monday before the Super
visors took action was $73 75.
The directors of the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Light Company will meet this
1 : morning to discuss the conditions with
' : which they are confronted. This is the
i ' regular weekly meeting of the director
. ' ate and has not been specially called be
. cause of the recent happenings which
1 have affected its shares. President
â  Crockett took a philosophic view of the
i matter yesterday. *:.â â¢
"I have not canvassed the situation
! either with the officers of the company
j or with our attorneys," he said. "There
Is no necessity of haste, as we feel sure
matters will adjust themselves satisfac
torily in due time. The Supervisors have
fixed a rate at which we are to supply
: our gas. If this is not legal the courts
will see that justice is done us. We ex
pect reasonable compensation for our
j products and we will got it."
"I do not believe the 1 Supervisors con
! ' templated the action which they took fin
; : ally in fixing the rate at $1 10. They hayÂ»
displayed a lack of knowledge of parlia.
mentary law and usage which has re.
1 suited in their voting without a clear con-
I ception of the matter under discussion.
1 The officers of the company have not out- i
lined their future plan of action. I do
not know whether the change made by
the Supervisors will complicate our ac
counts or not.
"Tile Supervisors undoubtedly have
Cower to correct any mistake they may
aye made, if they so desire, at any sun.
sequent meeting, so the action may be
undone at some future time. We have
been all through this before and are not
alarmed at the turn affairs have taken."

MIDNIGHT QUARREL.
Two Italian Fruit Dealers at the
Point of Death From Pistol and
Knife Wounds.
As a result of a trivial quarrel Amado de
Gracia and A. Arappa. two Italian fruit
dealers, are- lying at the Harl>or Receiv
ing Hospital suffering from knife and bul
let wounds and may not recover.
The two men met in Juba"s saloon at 420
Broadway last night and quarreled.
Arappa left to avoid trouble. He had
walked but a short distance when Dp
Gracia overtook him and struck him on
the head with a knife. Inflicting a nasty
wound, and as the assaulted man turned
around to discover his assailant he was
stabbed again over the right breast. In
an effort to escape further injury the
wounded man rushed Into the middle of
the street, and as De Gracia continued to
follow him Arappa pulled out his pistol
and nr>'.] throe times at him. Two of the
bullets took effect âone over the right eye
and the other in the abdomen. The sound
of the pistol shots attracted the police.
and both men were hurriedly sent to the
hospital.
Dr. Himmelshach found a three-inch in
cised scalp wound on Arappa's head and
a two-inch wound over the pectoral mus
cle. His wounds were dressed and he was
put to hed.
The physician extracted the bullet that
hard lodged over De Gracia's eye, but no
amount of probing could locate the one
that had entered the abdomen. He was
also placfÂ»d in the ward close to the man
he tried to kill. A policeman was detailed
to watch both men, as It was feared they
might renew their quarrel.
Detectives McMilmn and Wrenn visited
the hospital shortly after the- men
reached there and took th<Â»lr ante-mor
tem statements. The stories told by each
did not vary to any great extent.
De Gracia stated that Arappa Insulted
him on Sunday evening, and when he met
him last night he tried to get the latter to
explain his conduct.
The weapon used by De Gracia was a
pocket-knife, with a three-Inch blade,
shaped like a bowie-knife. The pistol was
38-ca!iher.
De Gracia resides at Stockton and
Broadway. He is well known to the po
lice as a quarrelsome and dangerous man.
He is said to have stabbed persons In
Italy and sinc^ his arrival in this coun
try. Arappa lives at 327 Broadway. Both
men are shout 86 years of ae<>. Although
the wounds are dangerous the doctor has
hope for their recovery.
MOTHERS CHASTISE
A HUMAN BRUTE
CHABLES NELSON ATTACKED AS
HE LEAVES COURT.
Exciting Scene in the Corridor of the
City Hall Outside Judge JMc
gan's Courtroom.
There was an exciting scene outside
Judge Mngan's courtroom yesterday
morning, caused by the screams of women
and girls and the frantic efforts of a
prisoner in charge of Policeman Coughlin
to shield himself from the attacks of the
women.
Charles Nelson, alias Johnston, a piano
player, was heM by the Judge to answer
hefore the Superior Court in $5000 bonds
on the charge of attempting to criminally
assault five little girls in his room on Fol
;;om street, whose ages ranged from 6 to
12 yours.
The girls and their mothers were at the
door of the warrant clerk"s room as
< Viughlin passed along with Nelson on
his way to the City Prison. One of the
women grabbed hold of Nelson with one
hand and struck him in the face with
the other, yelling at the top of her voice
"You scoundrelâ you scoundrel!" The
other women also rushed at him, and he
endeavored to shield himself by crouch
ing behind Coughlin. The little girls, see
ing their mothers so excited, began to
scr>--;im. and there was a rush to the
scene from all quarters of the hall.
<v,ughlin tried to shield the cowering
wretch as much as he could, but |he
women were not to be denied, and blow
after blow was rained upon Nelson's face
and body till some other policemen came
to Coughlln's assistance and Nelson was
hurried to the prison..
( me of the women was so excited that
she went into hysterics, and it took some
| time before she recovered. Nelson was
dragged away before the men who hur
ried to the scene comprehended what It
was all about, otherwise it might have
' fared worse with him.

OLYMPICS WIN THE
CHAMPIONSHIP CUP
DEFEAT Y. M. C. A. TEAM AT IN-
DOOR BASEBALL.
Final Game in the Tournament Is the
Feature of the "Ladies' Night"
Entertainment.
"Ladies' night" at the Olympic Club
drew a fair attendance last evening, and
the programme rendered for the delecta
tion of the fair sex was all that could be
desired in the way of indoor sport. Leader
Hammersmith, who had charge of the
entertainment, succeeded in providing an
attractive and well appreciated show,
even though he did for the nonce elimi
nate boxing contests from the list of at
â¢tractions.
The feature of the programme was the
Indoor baseball game between the Olym
pics and the Young Men's Christian As
sociation. It proved to be the last of the
series arranged between theee teams and
the Reliance Athletic Club team for the
championship of the Pacific Coast, as by
winning the Olympics clinched their
claim to the title and took possession of
the trophy, a handsome gold cup properly
inscribed.
The entertainment opened with a potato
race, in which there were seven contes
tants. Lester Hammersmith, with a han
dicap of four potatoes, won, with George
Klarniann, scratch, second. Oata Crable
was the first to fill his bucket, but was
disqualified because his shoes were not
mates, or for some equally good reason.
The other contestants were F. W. Bur
goss W. Bush, E. Connolly and George
Hinkle. .
Then came the indoor baseball game.
The teams lined up a.s follows:
Olympics. Positions. Y. M. C. A.
G. jams Catcher F. Foran
3 W. Norton Pitcher J. H. Harbour
H. Monahan First hasp E. C. McShane
C Perhain Soi-ond base F. Shaw

c KrelinK RiKht short P. Scott
!> Follanshce I.pft n>ld .1. TiX)hy
W. M. McUilne.,.. Right field H. S. Morton
The umpires were: George Knell for the
Olympics and Mr. Fowler for the Y. M.
C. A. Scorers. W. Taylor for the Olym
pics and Dr. H. L. Dietz for the Y. M.
C. A.
The Y. M. C. A. were the first at bat,
but were quickly retired, and in their half
of the inning the Olympics scored three
runs. At the end of the second inning the
score stood S to 0 in favor of the Olympics
and they maintained a safe lead to the
close, notwithstanding the efforts of their
opponents to even up matters. The latter
were clearly outclassed. Some of the in
dividual players played an excellent game
but the team lacked the vim of the Olym
pics and, was decidedly weak in the field. |
The score was as follows:
Y. M. C. A 0 0 0 14 111 0â S
Olympic I r, n i n 4 2 .1 â¢â is
The Olympics won four games out of
six in the tournament, the Reliance two |
out of five and the Y. M. C. A. two out of i
five. Had the Y. M. C. A. won last night
they would have tied the Olympic, and as j
they had another game scheduled with the
Reliance, might have won the trophy. As
It Ib, however, there will be no neces
sity for playing the remaining game.
The entertainment concluded with as
exhibition game of water polo between
the Bullfrogs and the Pollywogs, which
was won by the former, and an exhibition
of fancy diving.
Manager Ston* will take the Olympic
indoor baseball team to Stockton Satur
day night to play a game with the Stock
ton Athletic Association team next Sun
day afternoon.
HORSEMEN FIGHTING
IT OUT IN COURT
FRED FOSTER CARRYING $50,000
IN BAILBONDS.
Plunger Howard Lodges Additional
Charges Against His Former
Partner.
Fred Foster, the horseman, is again in
trouble with his erstwhile racing partner,
A. Howard, tho spectacular plunger from
Australia and Honolulu.
He was arrested last evening at the Ho
tel Metropole in Oakland and was brought
to this city by Detective Thomas Gibson
on a warrant sworn to before Judge Con
lan in the afternoon. Howard appears as
the complaining witness, and the charge
is obtaining money by false pretenses and
fraudulent re-presentations. He was re
leased late last evening by Judge Carroll
Cook on a $10.<W> hond.
Foster's troubles have come out of the
purchase of Sam McKeever and Yellow
Tall, two horses thai starred for a time
at the Oakland track. Foster claims that
he and Howard bought the horses jointly

rowing $151)0 of him.
Howard claims that he advanced the
$15,000 the animals cost and that in the
purchase Foster acted simply as his
agent. It developed that -Foster had had
the bills of sale made out in his name and
quietly shipped the animals out of the
State.
He was arrested in Oakland on a charge
of felony embezzlement and released on

THE RAILROAD OPPORTUNITY.
IX an interview published in- The Call and in other
rs on Sunday last C. P. Huntingdon was re
ted as disclaiming any responsibility for the
m, l>y the indorsement of the candidacy of Dan
iel M. Burns for the Federal Seuatorship, of a pledge
given during the last Senatorial campaign in the name
of the railroad. His additional observations printed
on Monday substantially confirm the first report. It
would have been better for the State and more satis
: â  to the Republican party if this qualified re
pudiation had come earlier.
It is a fact so well attested and so notorious asÂ» to
have become settled and accepted that the reiterated
assurance that all interference in party conventions
and canvasses and in elections by or on behalf of the
railroad had ceased was made in its name. It is
equally it the first announcement of the can
didacy of Dan Barns proceeded from William F.
Herrin. During the entire deadlock, in the teeth of
md the press, Dan Burns was backed by
the railroad f : ;. Almost daily it was charged and
admitted that the raHroad was determined that its
nominee should succeed or that no Senator should be
elected. It is solely for these reasons, and because the
majority of the Republican legislators kept the faith,
represented their constituencies and guarded the in
teir party, that the seat long occupied by
Stephen M. White remains vacant.
It is apparent and has been boldly published and
received that these treacherous and corrupt
were the result of a conspiracy, which
has fortunately been checked, to disintegrate the local
Republic:;n organization and in 1900 to turn the State
over to the Democracy. That the Examiner was in
volved in the con-piracy was proved by its tortuous
is course. It has never dared openly
tforwardly to deny that it secretly favored
the election of Dan Burns, and. if it had done so, its
denial would have been refuted by its own columns.
In the public mind the responsibility for this in
ible attempt to govern or de-
Mr<!> the Republican party of California is now fas
tened upon the railroad, which, under the testimony
b> it stands today, has been convicted, by falsehoods
ich it was impossible to guard, of having
sacrificed the public welfare to its inordinate greed
and arrogance. Mr. Huntington's published inter
view.-, after months of tacit acquiescence in the situa
tion, is a practical acknowledgment that the action of
Mr. Herrin. who is himself a Democrat, was at least
by the railroad authorities, and, to some
extent, implicates them in deliberate treason to a party
to which they and their predecessors owe all the
â¢rt they have had and to which they
nominally are attached. Even though Mr. Hunting
ton's personal disclaimer had been fuller and more
complete, it would still have been ineffective unless
formulated and ratified by his associates and followed
by the definite and unquestionable withdrawal of the
railroad from its assumed censorship over parties,
from low political intrigues, ahd from a virtual dic
tatorship over the various departments of municipal
and State government.
I:' such a p â ibiliry exists, it would be of great ad
vantage at the threshold of the epoch of commercial
and financial prosperity now distinctly before us for
all controversies between the railroad and the public
to be settled in a manly and in an honorable way.
The Call has several times made this suggestion. It is
within the power of Mr. Huntington and his asso
ciates promptly to bring about this desirable result.
If there be any individual and concentrated responsi
bility for the conditions lately existing it should be
clearly and openly placed where it belongs, and meas
ures taken not only to prevent a repetition of the dam
aging incidents of the past few months, but to c,on
vince the people that their repetition is impossible,
and that the railroad actually means to attend to its
own business, to rely upon the law administered in the
usual way for the protection of its rights and its in
terests, and to work in harmony with the public for
the common good. This revised attitude, if genuine,
would gratify solid and reputable citizens, who are
without prejudice and whose ears are closed to the
outcries of demagogues and cranks, and nothing less
would meet the demand of the Republican party.
The Call, as it has fully proved, has no desire to
perpetuate hostilities of any kind, but, without dog
matism and yet with firmness, insists that, neither in
the municipal contest shortly to be initiated nor in
the national campaign of next year, shall it be possible
with even superficial plausibility to connect the Re
publican party with the railroad, which, in the Sena
torial contest, it resisted and vanquished. Mr. Hun
tington hr.s frequently boasted of his Republicanism
since the formation of the party in 1856, and of his
contributions to its success in years when there was
no pending accusation of railroad corruption. He has
now an opportunity to show the strength of his fealty
to its principles by hardening mere pretensions into
recognized facts, f
SPECULATION IN TRUSTS.
1 ; VERY period of natural prosperity is accom
panied by a speculation fever. Speculation pre-
* â * cedes all panics. Prosperity, following exten
sion of trade, increase of consumption, enlargement of
wages, puts profit and ready money into the hands of
great numbers of people unaccustomed to a great sur
plus of cash. A large percentage of them desire to
use their quickly and newly acquired means so as to :
get a large speculative increase in it, and make them i
fes rich as anybody. These people are the reckless
buyers of trust stocks. Their avarice is inflamed
by what they read of the profits of such property.
They think every trust is like every other trust, and
each is like the pioneer, the Standard Oil Company,
and that everybody can become a Rockefeller.
We have had these speculative crazes in California,
running to mining stocks. When the Comstock deal
was on it is known that men had books of stock cer
tificates printed on mines that existed only in the |
name and vignette, and these when put on the mar- j
ket were bought as eagerly as trust stock is taken
now. The process was like fishing on the New
foundland banks, where some clams are thrown into
the water and the hooks arc put down with bits of
white cotton cloth tied to them, to be eagerly taken |
by the fish in their scramble for the real bait. It is i
but little satisfaction to be able to say that a vast ma- |
jority of these formidable trusts whose stock is now
being gobbled will prove worthless, and that the dan
ger in their existence, now seen by social phil
osophers, is a myth, for their failure will take from j
their stockholders the investment of their profits !
gained in legitimate trade, and a panic will follow
overspeculation in this stock as it- has always followed
overspeculation in anything.
If trusts did not offer such ready facility for specu- j
lation if would seek some other means of gratifying j
the desire of men to become suddenly rich, and as j
the bursting of the trust bubble will disillusion the i
people and take its terrors away from the trust spec-, j
ttr, perhaps it is well that speculation has selected that j
field.
One thing is sure, that if no one bought trust stock
none would be in existence, and it is also true that if
the prosperity of the country did not distribute the
money into fresh hands there would be none to use
in that way. It should be remembered that the or
ganization of trusts was not a feature of the years im
mediately ensuing upon* the panic of 1893. Money ;
went out of circulation when confidence disappeared,
and of the comparatively few trusts theretofore in ex
istence as large a percentage as of other business or
ganizations went into bankruptcy. Cordage, match
and biscuit trusts, and many others, were victims of
panic, proving that this form of corporation bears no
charmed life and is subject to the same vicissitudes as j
the ordinary partnership or other form of business.
It is well, then, for prudent men to look upon the I
present activity in forming trutts as the reflection of j
the speculative tendency that always goes hand in
hand with good times, and to do what may be to make j
it less rampant, for as its excesses rise the time of i
panic and trouble is brought nearer.
Speculation seems inseparable from business.
Whether it seek for the object of its expected gain
George Law's Mississippi scheme, William Paterson's i
Scotch Darien Company, the Morismulticaulus, Dutch
bulbs, Hooley's companies, Barney Barnato's kaffirs,
railway stocks or trust certificates, it is all the same.
It is the steam pressing in the boiler of business and
sure to burst it soon or late, unless the safety valve is
kept in working order. It should not be forgotten
that speculation in this country is more subject to
vicissitudes now than ever. We have assumed a po- \
sition which puts both legitimate and speculative i
business more than ever at the mercy of our inter- j
national affairs, and a single perturbation therein will
profoundly affect both. We need more than ever
sound ideas and practices in business, a sound finan
cial system and sound currency, for we are more ex
posed to emergencies over which we have no control.
Therefore let him that standeth take heed lest he fall.
The one who is down already can have no change in
his affairs except to get up.
The country needs legislation to protect its credit, j
its currency, its standard of value, now more than it
was needed in the late panic. It was down then and j
could only rise, and getting up was for the better.
Being now on its feet, it should avert as long as pos
sible another fall, and minimize its consequences when
it comes.
ELECTION BY PLURALITIES.
JUDGING from the tone of our Eastern con
temporaries in discussing the Senatorial dead
locks, a strong sentiment has been formed in
that section in favor of Senator Hoar's proposal for
the election of Senators hereafter by a plurality in
stead of a majority vote. The reform is one that can
be readily accomplished, and that fact has much to do
in determining public opinion in its favor.
Section 4of article I of the constitution of the
United States provides: "The times, places and man
ner of holding elections for Senators and Representa
tives shall be prescribed in each State by the Legis
lature thereof, but the Congress may at any time by
law make or alter such regulations, except as to the
places of choosing Senators."
The law which now regulates the election of Sen
tors was enacted by Congress in 1866. It provides that
balloting for Senators shall begin on the second
Tuesday after the organization of the Legislature and
shall continue daily until some c^ididate receives a
majority of all votes cast. Since it is thus an act of-
Congress which makes a majority vote necessary for
the choice of a Senator, it appears to be indisputable
that Congress may. if it see fit, by an amendment of
the law ptovide for election by a bare plurality.
An argument much relied upon by the advocates of
the reform is that plurality- elections are well known
to our political mechanism. Thus as the Philadel
phia Inquirer says: "The plurality rules in every
State and in all national elections, and it is only in
elections for Senator that an absolute majority is re
quired. In the last sixty year? only three Presidents
have had an absolute majority .of all the popular votes
during times of peace. There are few Congressmen
who had an absolute majority at the elections last fall.
Why should Senators be compelled to have a major
ity if a President and House can be elected by* a
plurality?"
While these arguments are valid so far as they go,
they do not affect the deeper evil of the problem to be
solved. Election by a plurality vote would put an end
to deadlocks, but would not prevent the graver scan
dals of bribery and corruption of which the deadlock
is but a symptom. Such a methad of election would
be, in fact, a distinct gain to the. vicious elements in
our political system. It would be easier for the
bosses to obtain a plurality than a majority in a Leg
islature, and thus the proposed reform would have no
other effect than that of depriving honesty of one of
its safeguards against dishonesty.
The subject is one deserving more than casual at
tention. The force with which the proposed amend
ment is being urged in the East leads to the conclu
sion that a strong effort will be made to procure its
THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1899.
enactment at the next' session of Congress. It may
be regarded, therefore, as a measure of practical poli
tics, and all who desire the accomplishment of a true
reform by providing for the election of Senators by
direct vote of the people should prepare to oppose the
plurality scheme in whatever form it is presented. '
HONOR THE PATRIOT DEfID.
AT Arlington Cemetery to-morrow the bodies of
many American soldiers who fell in the Cuban
campaign will be buried with simple but
solemn ceremony, and the President by proclamation
has given orders that during the afternoon of that day
the national flag shall be displayed at half-mast on all
public buildings, forts, camps and national vessels.
The sentiment which prompted the proclamation is
felt by all loyal hearts throughout the Union. The ob
servance of the day should therefore be common to
all. The expression of honor to the memory of the
patriot dead should not be left to the Government
alone. The people should take part in it. Every
home or office or factory having a flag should display
it at half-mast, and evidences of public sympthy with
the ceremony at Arlington should be everywhere
visible.
In the course of his proclamation the President
clearly sets forth the reason why there should be a
special commemoration of the day. "It is fitting," he
said, "that in behajf of the nation tributes of honor be
paid to th,e memories of the noble men who lost their
lives in their country's service during the late war with
Spain. It is the more fitting, inasmuch as in con
sonance with the spirit of our free institutions and in
obedience to the most exalted promptings of patriot
ism, those who were sent to other shores to do bat
tle for their country's honor under their country's flag
went freely from every quarter of our beloved land.
Each soldier, each sailor, parting from home ties and
putting behind him private interests in the presence
cf the stern emergency of unsought war with an alien
foe, was an individual type of devotion of the citizen
to the state which makes our nation strong in unity
and in action."
It is unnecessary to add anything to those words.
From the homes of California as well as from those of
her sister States young men went forth to foreign
lands to give their lives if need be at the call of the
nation. Distant as is Arlington Cemetery from" us,
every word uttered there in the burial service to-mor
row will find a response in Californian homes. It is
but right, therefore, that we should be among the
most earnest in manifesting honor to the patriot dead.
Let every national flag in the city be floated at half
mast to-morrow. This is a city of banners. It is
doubtful if in any other community does so large a
proportion of the people possess a national flag. The
ardor of our people at the outbreak of the war with
Spain led almost every one to purchase a flag, and for
a time, when the spirit of battle was upon us, the city
was as radiant with banners as if it were a season of
festivals.
All of these flags should be brought forth to-day.
They were flung to the breeze in former times at the
full height of the mast in honor of the brave as they
marched or sailed to battle; let them now with an
equal honor float at half-mast for the heroes who fell
in the service. ,
THE decision of Judge Bahrs in the Geary-street
turntable case clarifies a subject which has here
tofore been obscured by conflicting opinions.
The turntable at Lotta's fountain has long been a
public nuisance and various efforts have been made to
| effect its removal. But it was built under a franchise
i granted by the Board of Supervisors and has been
sustained in its position by authority of law. About
a year ago, however, the Supervisors tackled it in
earnest. They adopted a resolution declaring it to be
a nuisance and directing the Superintendent of Streets
to abate it forthwith. When the latter prepared to
move on the turntable, in force, however, the Geary
Street Company procured an injunction from the Su
perior Court and put a summary stop to further pro
ceedings. It is this injunction which Judge Bahrs
| now sustains, leaving the opponents of the turntable
: high and dry upon the beach of litigation.
But in declaring that the Board of Supervisors had
no power to remove this turntable by force Judge
Bahrs has enunciated a valuable and interesting prin
ciple of municipal law. He holds that where the de
struction of property is involved the police powers of
the Supervisors with respect to public nuisances are
limited to commencing actions for condemnation. In
other words, the law is that nuisances are abatable
I summarily by decree of municipal authorities only
when they are detrimental to the public health and
1 no damage will be done to property by their sup
pression.
If the law were otherwise the Board of Supervisors
might declare the City Hall a nuisance and order it
removed. Of course there would be differences of
opinion upon this point, for in some respects the City
Hall is a nuisance, notably in giving asylum to a
large number of persons whose only purpose in life
is to deplete the accumulations of the taxpayers; but
it would be an extraordinary state of affairs if the law
I empowered the Supervisors to order the City Hall
torn down whenever it suited their caprice.
Judge Bahrs points out clearly a way for securing
the demolition of the Geary-street turntable. He says
that any person interested may commence an action
i to condemn the contrivance, and upon the trial of the
I action all the facts of the case may be brought out and
| a judicial decree entered. If this decree be against the
turntable it may then be executed in the usual way.
The whole power of the State will be behind it. and,
j if necessary, the militia can be called out to enforce it.
â  These powers, as we understand it, may also be util
| ized to demolish other nuisances than the one which
makes the nights of an esteemed morning contempo
rary hidous.
As it is reported that many of the captured Filipinos
have shown themselves discontented when disarmed
and turned loose instead of being imprisoned and fed,
it is evident the canned beef story has not yet been
translated into their language.
There was a time when the worst style of boss dic
tation known to us was described as "raw," but the
talk Huntington and Hubbard are giving us just now
sounds a good deal more like something which has
been embalmed.
If nothing else was done by the Legislature, a ma
jority of the Republicans in that body defeated the
railroad conception of expansion. The railroad con
tracted to expand Burns, but that form of expansion
collapsed.
Possibly the reason why Herrin does not reply to
Huritington's assertion that the Southern Pacific had
nothing to do with the Senatorial contest, at Sacramen
to is because he has been struck dumb with amaze
ment.
Have your flags ready to float at half-mast in honor
of the heroic dead to-morrow. The observance of the
day should be popular as well as national.

RANCH AND RURAL NOTES.
Since the development of artesian water for irrigation on the Kern
County, Mojave and Colorado deserts in California experiments have been
made on the desert of Sahara in Africa and now 12,000,000 acres are under
crop there, irrigated by artesian wells.
For success in poultry raising use only the eggs of old hens for hatch

The Horticultural Society of Minnesota recommends this cure for bar
renness in apple trees. Remove a section of bark an inch wide clear around
the tree, taking care not to injure the cambium or membrane, and fill the
space with crabapple bark neatly fitted. The place is then bound with strips
of old cotton cloth wound around neatly and tightly so as to cover the in
serted bark and about an inch above and below. The cloth must then be
tied tightly with stout twine, so that swaying in the wind will not break
the contact of the new bark with the old. The bandage may be waxed with
grafting wax. In about ten days the union will be complete. In that cli
mate it is recommended that this operation be performed between the oth
and 25th of June. This treatment will also force bearing in young trees.
Don't wash eggs before taking to market. The use of water on an egg
shell deprives it of a substance which excludes the air and the egg soon
rots.
Japan last year imported 182,484 pounds of butter, of which California
furnished 75,000 pounds, at an average price of 35 cents per pound. The
hermetically sealed butter in small packages sells there readily, but becomes
rancid soon after opening, so that 8 ounce packages are preferred.
Each 4000 pounds of milk contains 22 pounds of nitrogen, 11 pounds of
potash and 9 pounds of phosphoric acid. This is nearly all in the skimmilk,
and if that is fed on the farm to pigs and chickens nearly all these fertile
elements are returned to the soil. Nitrogen, potash and phosphoric acid are
the plant food of the land and should not be wasted.
The American Cultivator reports the following results of chicken feed
ing: A lot of 133 chickens, weighing an average of four pounds and five
ounces, or a total of 575 pounds, was selected for feeding. The first three
weeks they gained 258 pounds. Then they began moulting and in the next
two weeks gained only 25 pounds, but the sixth week they gained 58 pounds,
weighing 916 pounds, or 6 pounds and 14 ounces each. In the six weeks
they ate 1738 pounds of grain and 2589 pounds of skim milk, or nearly 12
pounds and 1 ounce of grain and 19*4 pounds of skim milk each. In their
condition when the feeding began they were worth 6 cents a pound, when
fattened they were worth 10 cents a pound, thus they gained in value
cents each. The food cost 15^ cents each.

STATE NOTES.
C. M. Harrison of Biggs has planted ten acres of hemp on his Butte
Creek ranch. The land is slickens over adobe, and the experiment of grow

lands have been coated with slickens by hydraulic mining.
The orchardists of Haywards are considering the advisability of a dis
tillery for use on surplus fruits. Prunes, peaches and other fruits are made
into merchantable liquors. In Europe peels and pits of fruit are used in the
still, and nothing grown in an orchard is wasted. This State is producing
a large crop of figs, of which much is not put to profitable use. Fig brandy
is a highly prized liquor, and if made here would find a ready market.
When pump irrigation was found necessary to save orchards last year
the fuel question became important and the prunings were used. In their
loose state they were expensive to handle and T. G. Rogers of Winters in
vented a brush baler. It is a large, strong sawhorse, to which a strong
lever is bolted, with four strong tines bent in a semi-circle. The saw-
horse is filled with the brush, the lever is pulled down and fastened with a
ratchet, compressing the brush into a small bale, -which is bound with wire
and is as convenient to handle as a stick of wood.

President Crlttenden Outlines His
General Plans to the Judiciary
Committee of the Board
of Supervisors.
If the assurances given the Judiciary
Committee of the Board of Supervisors
yesterday afternoon are carried into effect
this city will have by the end of the pres
ent year a competing telephone company
as fully and perfectly equipped as money
and skill can make it.
The matter came up under the consid
eration by the committee of the petition
of the People's Mutual Telephone Com
pany for the revocation of the order oi
the laft Board of Supervisors, disqualify
ing a $10,0)0 bond given three years ago
by the company in compliance with the
terms of its franchise. James L. Critten^
den, president of the company, appeared
for the petitioners. He declared that his
company had entered into contracts for
the expenditure of $2*6,000 for the build
ing and perfecting of a modern telephone
system having underground conduits hÂ«
ail of the downtown districts for the ex
tension of its wires.
Of this amount Mr. Critrenden said the
sum of $110,000 was to be paid for a
switchboard of the latest and most im
proved pattern and exactly on the same
plans as the one now in use in St. Louis.
He further said that his company had al
ready entered into contracts to furnish
1700 business firms and private residences
with telephones, and that he expected the
number of contracts so made to aggre

Mr. Crittenden explained to the com

the People s Mutual Telephone Company
about three years ago. and that the com
pany, after complying with all of the re
quirements of the grant, had begun the
work of laying underground conduits.
This work was stopped by injunction and
since that time the matter has been
fought out in the courts, the Supreme,
Court finally deciding the controversy- in
favor of the Mutual Company. The com
pany's bonds are now being prepared for
sale, contracts have been let and if pres
ent expectations are fulfilled the company
will have its telephones ready for use by
the Ist of January. 190).
The matter of the $10,000 bond will be

ULTIMATUM OF
THE TEACHERS
IS ACCEPTED
Merchants Notify the
Auditor.
CONFERENCE OF ATTORNEYS
NO MOKE INJUNCTIONS WILL
BE SERVED.
Thirty-Five Thousand Dollars Now
Available to Pay Eighty-Six
Thousand Dollars' Worth
of Claims.
Auditor Wells was notified yesterday
that the ultimatum issued by the teach
ers at their meeting held at ;he Giris'
High School Monday afternoon would be
accepted by the merchants and its terms
complied with. This means that the.mer
chants will forego their intention to en
join the salaries of the teachers for the
balance of the present fiscal year, and
that they will accept the $35,000 availa
ble to meet the demands of the School
Department fund prior to the first of
January. It also means that the teach
ers on their part agree to dismiss all
pending litigation over the distribution
of the $35,000, and that they will aban
don all claim to it, so that the merchanta
may divide the entire amount among
themselves as they see fit.
A vital part of this understanding is
that while the teachers relinquish all
claim to the only money now available
for the payment of their back salaries,
they do not by so doing invalidate their
claims against the city. These claims
will be pressed in some manner not yet
determined. This will be a subject for
after consideration.
The claims of the merchants against
the city aggregate something more than
$86,000. Now that the teachers have
stepped out of the legal arena there is
now available about $35,000 which can be
applied to the liquidation of thesÂ£ claims.
To whom and in what manner this
money is to be distributed is the prob
lem that is now confronting the Auditor
and the attorneys for the merchants.
Yesterday Attorney Frank Powers, rep
resenting the merchant creditors, called
on Auditor Wells and informed him of
the intentron of the merchants to com
ply with the decision of the teachers. He
then suggested that it was the desire
of his clients to secure possession of the
available $35,000 as soon as possible. The
Auditor expressed a willingness to au
thorize the payment of the money, and
said he would do so at once if the attor
ney would point out how it could be done
legally and in a manner so that the
rights of the Auditor and the city
would be protected. This was too knotty
a problem to be solved at once, and after
a lengthy discussion the Auditor referred
the matter to his attorney with instruc
tions to confer with Mr. Powers as to the
best method on which to proceed.
During the conference in the Auditor's
office Attorney Powers suggested that
the entire sum be paid to some one per
son to be designated by the merchant
creditors, that person to distribute the
amount pro rata according to the amount
due each of the various creditors. He
also suggested that enough of the out
standing claims be selected to make up
the amount of $35.n00, and that the Aud
itor pay these with the understanding
that the money so paid should be distrib
uted among all of the creditors. Xeither
of these propositions were acceptable
to the Auditor and they were therefore
rejected as impracticable. It will prob
ably be several days before the manner
of payment will be decided upon.
A Compromise Effected.
The damage suit of Mrs. Ethel D. Saw
kins against the Market-street Railway
Company came to a sudden ending >es
terday. The casp was on trial before
Judge Daingerfield and the plaintiff had
not yet rested her case when her counsel
arose and asked that the case be dis
missed, as a compromise had been ef
fected. The exact amount paid Mrs.
Sawkins was not stated in court, but it
is understood that the Market-sireet
Company paid $900 and costs.
Pierce Gets the Land.
A jury in the United States Circuit
Court yesterday rendered a verdict for the
plaintiff in the case of Henry Pierce

ant from 228 acres of land in Contra Costa
County and to vest the title in Pierce.

FLORENTINE RUBIO HAD

A PHILIPPINE WANTS TO BE

A Tangle Results, but Finally the
Applicant Is Forced to Forswear
Allegiance to Spain and
Aguinaldo.
Florentine Rubio, a Filipino, wants to
become a citizen of this Government. This j
is a laudable intention on the part of '
Florentine, but it caused considerable |
trouble in Judge Daingerfield's court \
yesterday. When .Florentine presented j
himself and asked permission to take out
his first papers, it became necessary, in
asmuch as he is an alien, that he for
â wear allegiance to the flag under which
he claimed protection. This caused the |
difficulty. He was a Filipino, and for i
had dwelt under Spanish rule. I
Spain's rule in the Philippines has ceased
to be, and instead there remains the frag
ments of the shattered "Philippine re
public," of which one Aguinaldo is the I
President. Th<- Philippines are practical- j
ly a part of the United States at the pres
ent time, so the legal tangle that re- i
suited was excusable". Finally Judge !
Daingerfield decided to make Florentine
forswear allegiance to Spain and "the so
called Philippine Republic," after which
he allowed him to take out his first pa- [
jir-rs. The Judges of the Superior Court j
will now look into the matter, and if in
thf future a Filipino appears for first
papers he will be dealt with without
delay. , .

LILLIAN POST DIES
IN AGNEWS ASYLUM
LILLIAN POST, the opera singer, died at Agnews Asylum yesterday af-.
ternoon of heart failure. The prima donna was taken to the asylum late
Monday afternoon by her son, H. Blair. She was in a very feeble condi
tion and it could be seen that the end was not far off. She rallied some
what during the night and yesterday morning she was a little better
and spoke of her travels to Hawaii and Australia to Dr. Christal. Her
mind seemed to wander back to the time when she was in the height of
her stage career. About 1 o'clock she was attacked with heart failure and
sank into a comatose condition, dying a half hour later. Dr. Sponogle and
Dr. rhristal wore in attendance. Her remains will be brought to San Fran
cisco this morning.
Overwork, her friends say, tvas the primary cause of the singer's mental
and physical breakdown, terminating: In her death. Miss Post, as she was
known on the stage, or Mrs. Goodwin in private life, was one of tte many
San Francisco girls who have gained fame before the footlights irr many
countries.
Graduating from amateur musical circles into the professional ranks
nearly twenty years ago. Miss Post played her first engagement in her na
tive town ac a member of Emelle Melville's original Pinafore company.
Later on she became associated with De Wolf Hopper, Delia Fox, Jack Raf
fael and others who have since become prominent In light opera as a mem
ber of the McCall company. A few years ago Miss Post filled a long and sue
t euful engagement at the Tivoli here- until she was compelled to retire be
caUM of a severe throat affection. Upon her recovery she made a tour of
Australia, returning from there only a few months ago. Since her return
until last week she resided with her husband at 636 O'Farrell street." On
Thursday her malady had assumed such a form tj^at it was deemed advis
able to place her under restraint. She was taken to the City Receiving Hos
pital and the following day an attempt was made to remove her to a pri
vate s-.anitarium, but she jumped^ from the carriage and her husband took
her back to the hospital, where she remained until Monday, when she was
taken to Agnews.

SCHEME OF THE

DEFEAT POLICE
Tickets No Longer
Bear a Date.
ARE USELESS AS EVIDENCE
CHINESE MADE DESPERATE BY
THE CONSTANT RAIDS.
Lieutenant Price and Posse Gather
In Visitors to an Opium Joint
and Secure Evidence
of Crime.
The Chinatown squad under Lieutenant
Price is wise, but the Celestials whom it
is set to guard seem to be wiser
still. Whenever the. police get wise on a
scheme the Chinese at once bend all their
energies toward petting the best of the
men who wear the stars. The lottery deal
ers in particular have been the shrewdest
men the police have had to contend with
of late, and the lottery dealers seem to
have the upper hand at present.
During the past few days a number of j
raids have been made on the fan-tan
games, the opium dens and the dealers in ;
lottery tickets, and these have set all I
Chinatown agog. There was a time when !
tickets could be purchased regularly in |
certain stands. The police succeeded in j
breaking up this practice, and then the j
wary Celestials resorted to the practice!
of employing agents, who would mark
tickets in almost any out of the way cor- i
ner. The squad under Lieutenant Price ,
has captured so many at this illicit prac
tice of late that it has been practically
abandoned and the dealers have found a j
new game.
Last night Officer Stephen Bonner of the '
squad noticed a Chinaman handing an j
envelope to a white man in a manner j
which excited his suspicion. He captured j
the white man. and on examining the en- |
velope found it containt-d a lottery ticket
already marked. The time of the draw
ing, however, was not marked on the
ticket, but on the envelope. He did not

there was no evidence against him. It
is no crime to have a lottery ticket in i
your possession unless it is tor a drawing !

date must be marked on the ticket. The
ticket found had no date upon it. The
date was on the envelope, hut there was j

this means everything, but in a court it

This is not the only new scheme of the
lottery men to evade the clutches of the
law. One of the oldest companies in Chi
natown has abandoned tickets altogether,
and instead of them the agent carries a
book. The man who wishes to play points
out his numbers on the book. A record
is taken by the agent, who also makes a
private mark by which he can recognize
the player and the job is done. The books
bear nekher date nor name and cannot be
introduced as evidence. The police are
using their wits to defeat these new
schemes, but if they succeed the Chinese
will only resort to new methods.
A successful raid was made last night
by Lieutenant Price and P^fse on an
opium joint on Clay street. Five Chinese,
together with a complete layout of pipes,
scales and parcels of opium, were secured.
WEBE CAUGHT IN THE ACT.
Three Fish Killers Discovered Using
Dynamite in Austin Creek.
The State Fish Commissioners and sports
men generally are rejoicing over a recent
capture of three fellows who were caught
in the set of "shooting" a trout stream
with dynamite. For some time past the
State officers .have wondered why Austin
Creek in Sonoma County was so barren
of trout, and all kinds of fish as well,
when all of the other streams in the coun
ty were productive of the finny tribe, es
pecially on the opening of the season.
With a view <>i learning something of the
cause Secretary J. P. Babcock and Deputy
A. W. Wilson made a trip to the creek
on Sunday, and while they worked hard
and used all of the arts known to the
trout fishers to get a fish their efforts
were without result. At last, tired and
discouraged, they rested on a high bank
at the junction of East and West Austin
creeks.
After a while three men appeared and
their actions showed that there was mis
chief in the air. With great caution the
fellows exploded a charge of dynamite in
the deep pool. It is very difficult to catch
a dynamite "fisher" in the act, and "Bill"
Meyer, who was the chief operator, was
so taken by surprise that he mado no de
fense except to say that he wanted the
fish and took that means to get them.
This explained the absence of fish in Aus
tin Creek, which in former years was a
fine trout stream. Complaints were sworn
to before Justice Brown of Santa Kosa,
and on Saturday the preliminary examin
ation will be held, under a recent deci
sion of the Supreme Court such cases are
triable in the. Superior Court, and the pun
ishment may be anything from $250 and
150 days in the county jail upward.

NEW YORK DRIED FRUIT MARKET.
The New York Commercial says: There is
rather more doing in raisins with the West,
but* insufficient so far as to cause any mate
rial change in the market. It Is noted, how
ever, that there is a firmer feeling on inside
prico?, and some holders think an advance Is
likely to occur at any time. Spot supplies of
two arid three crowns arc said to be small and
closely concentrated. There has been consid
erable inquiry from dealers in the West for
these two sizes, but little business results, be
cause of the different views as recards rices.
Bpbt stocks of other graaes are larger, but. as
a rule, arc moving out fairly well at unchanged
and firm prices. Ungraded cannot be bought
less than 4%c, ami yonie holders .i!.: an ad
vance .111 that figure. Sultanas are fiat. Valen
cia* meet no demand. London layers are not
wunu-d, and some holdors have shaded prices
in thu hope of currying out what stocks are In
Bifiht.
Prunes are steady, but under present condi
tion distribution is not large. There' is a prom
ising outlook, however, which indicates a pos
sible advance in tin' near future on the larger
sizt-s. Few larse-sized Oregons are left, and
prices art- held very stiff on what few are re
maining. Ther*> appears to be an improved de
mand for 70-SO's, oralas, and prices rule
steady on all -qualities. Larger sizes are about
tlrtn. and smaller ones show an upward ten
dency.
Other items of driwl fruit are steady at about
previous quotations, with holders confident of
improvement on practically all varieties.

NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 4.â Stock trading to-day
was very sensitive and moved Irregularly.
After a wild and high opening for many stocks
realization? of active Interests and depressing
efforts on the part of professionals tended to
produce recessions, particularly in the active
specialties, which of late have attained the
larcest advance. The traffic agreement between
Third Avenue and Manhattan produced a large
advance in both of those properties at the
â  opening. Third Avenue rising; 6 points and
Manhattan 3 points. This brought ' about ex
tensive realizing and the stocks ' gradually re
ceded. Third Avenue losing S on the day and
Manhattan half as much. Metropolitan lost

In the trade war left Sugar 6 points down.
The suit to restrain Brooklyn Transit from
leasing a former rival traction company to
gether with realizing on Brooklyn Transit's
large advance caused the stock to ease off 3
points. The iron and steel shares ended Ir
regularly, with Federal Steel and American

NEW YORK, April 4.â The Journal of Com
merce says: Reports of damage to growing
crops In' Southern Europe by unfavorable
weather are beginning to arrive. The trade
j here has learned to expect them and put their
own valuation upon statements emanating In
' almost all Instances from interested parties.
j In very many Instances these early" reports ore
! almost wholly discredited by later Develop
I ments, and consequently holders here do not
seem to be much disturbed over the prospect
Of pi shortage In the output this year of such
fruits and nuts ac have not already been dis
placed In the American market.- by cheaper
California products. Latest advices of crop
damage come from Greece in connection with
currants, but they are rather vague. assign
ing no' cause for "unfavorable crop conditions."
Handlers of currants here are at a .loss to un
derstand just what influences at this early day
can be affecting crop â¢prospects, as vines are
only just beginning to bud.
There Is little doubt that the almond crop of
France suffered considerable damage through
j recent frosts, but that It will be a total loss,
as some reports Indicate, the trade Is not ap
parently " disposed to believe until more defi
nite Information Is received. From Tarragona.
also, come cables re.porting that that crop has
been seriously injured, and according to one
shipper it will prove a total loss. As the ship
per referred to ie understood to be carrying
Borne stock from the last crop, his statement. It
is thought, may have Interested motives behind
It. Sicily mall advices Just received are to the
effect that while some injury has been done
to the almond crop In certain sections, the
outlook is for an average, output. No reports
of damage to the Barl or Malaga crops have
so far been received.

Cheese has been carefully tested by a
German chemist, who placed the samples
In an artificial digestive fluid containing
a considerable proportion of fresh gastric
juice. Cheshire and Roquefort cheese
took four hours to digest, Gorgonzola
eight hours, Romadour nine hours and
Brie, Swiss and ten other varieties ten
hours. As an ordinary meal is digested
in four or five hours, the 'common belief
that cheese aids digestion appears to be
erroneous.

WELTER WEIGHTS WHO
ARE EVENLY MATCHED
Â§ Green and Smith Have Finished Training For Â±
I Friday's Battle. f
â¦â  Â©
O /T\ HE twenty-round boxing- contest between George Green and "Myste- 4
4 I rious Billy" Smith at Woodward's Pavilion on Friday evening before the O
O I National Club will be the last one to be given under the old law regu- 4
4- I biting prizefights. The new law which makes prizefighting legal In Call- O
O - 1 - fornla caused the introduction of a resolution in the Board of Super- 4
-- visors, in which it is proposed to regulate the sport In the future by Â©
O fixing a license of $5000 a year as a police measure. Should this order go >
4- through it will have the effect of driving the smaller athletic organizations O
O who give boxing contests out of the business, while the larger clubs are â +
4- bound to flourish. 6
Â© The light between Green and Smith on Friday is sure to prove a highly T
X Interesting one. Both men are trained to the hour and are in superb condl- V
*Â£ tion. Each has a victory over the other to his credit, and the manner of q
q this contest will establish the question of supremacy for all time. They will 1
4- weigh in on Friday at 3p. m., and Green will go in at 151 pounds, while p
O Smith will probably tip the beam at 140, so the weight will cut a very small 4
â¦ figure. O
O Smith knocked out Frank Kelly in thirty-seven rounds, while Green per- X
X formed the same service in four rounds, and again won from Kelly in Â§
5Â£ twelve rounds. ?j
ft Green and Smith both knocked out "Shadow" Maher, the former In -4
4- seven and the latter in twenty-six rounds. Â©
O Green won from "Danny" Needham in eight rounds and the latter was 4
knocked out by Smith in fourteen rounds. Q
O Joe Walcott knocked Green out In eighteen rounds. Smith fought two 4
"*" draws with Walcott and eventually defeated the colored man in twenty O
O rounds. +
4- Tommy Ryan won from Green in eighteen rounds. In six contests with O
O Ryan, Smith fought three draws, lost to him twice and once there was no â +
4- decision; . . O
Â© Charles McKeever lost to Green in fifteen rounds and Smith in twenty- -*â¢
4" five. O
9 It is a peculiar coincidence that In these contests Green and Smith have 4
Â£ each five victories to their credit and suffered defeat twice. Besides this, Â§
5? Smith, who fought oftener than Green, has four draws and a "no decision" A
(5 contest on his list. Honors appear to be about even and a stubborn contest X
â¦ Is looked for. . â¢ O

ASSAULTS AN
OLD BOOKMAKER
Quarreled Over a
Race Decision.
THREATENED HIS LIFE
OUTCOME OF THE BULING OF
JUDGES AT OAKLAND.
W. E. Scott Consults With Chief of
Police Lees as to His Encoun
ter With the Burly
Horseman.
Edward Corrigan, the deposed czar of
Ingleside racetrack, has added to his long
list of street brawls in which he has been
a principal. This time his victim is an
aged bookmaker, crippled with rheuma
tism. Happily, friends came to his assist
ance before the burly president of the Pa
cific Coast Jockey Club could do any
harm. Corrigan left his intended victim,
breathing threats of violence.
The encounter took place on a Market
street cur on Monday night. W. E. Scott,
a member of the bookmaking linn of
Hoffman & Co. of St. Louis, formed one
of a party with Corrigan. An an
imated discussion was in progress
as to the fairness of the decision in the
filth race. This race was won by two open
lengths by Pat Alorris.sey, Corrigan's entry
finishing in second place. Without any
protest being filed with them the judges
disqualified the winner and placed the
representative of the Corrigan stable firs:.
The outcome of the race was the sole
topic of conversation among bookmakers
! and racegoers alike. Mr. Scott contrib
uted to the discussion on the way up fr"Â»:i
the ferry by saying: "The remark of a
racegoer in the betting ring expresses my
views. He said he supposed they dis
qualified Pat Morrisey because he wa.s
â¢trying.' "
Corrigan turned to him and retorted,
"I suppose you had a $2 bet on him. \
Scott stuck to his guns, saying, "I didn't
have a net on him, but I know you had
12000 bet on your horse." Corrigan applied
uji epithet to him.
The language applied by Corrigan an
gered Scott, and despite his age and crip
pled condition he struck at the Chicagoan
with his cane. A struggle ensued lor pos
3ession of that weapon, its owner intend
ing to tight to the end. Some women pas
sengers shrieked for assistance and at
tracted the attention of passers by to ti:e
altercation. By this time the car had'
reached the Palace Hotel, and Corrigan ,
retired from the field. Before the car
moved off he said lie would kill Scott on;
si^ht and that he would soon be dead
anyway.
Scott In return called him a thief and
said that every dollar he ever made
was by robbing people. He also reminded
Corrigan that he knew what information
he had as to his past deeds on many
tracks in the Middle West. After Bleeping
over his encounter with Corrigan, Scut
sought the advice of Chief of Police Lees
as to the propriety of having his assail
ant bound over to keep the peace. After
telling his troubles Smti left without any
definite steps being taken in the premises.
"Mr. Scott called on me this morning
and told me of the threats Mr. Corrigan
had made," said chief of Pol i Leee last
night. "I have known Mr. Scott some
years, as ho cam*- to me when there was
racing at the old Bay District track with
a letter from Chief of Police Harrlgan of
Chicago. lie did not ask me to take any
action against Mr. Corrigan in this case,
but just told me the story of his encoun
ter with the horseman. I asked him what
precipitated the quarrel and he said: 'I
called Corrigan a thief because of the de
cision on the disputed race at Oakland.'
"I laughed when he said that was all
the provocation hi' had given Mr. Corri
gan. I thought that alone was suffli
to precipitate a quarrel. Mr. Scott did
not ask that Mr. Corrigan !.â¢ arrested or
bound over to keep the peace."
A Drunken Son.
N. P. Howard, B69V$ Minna street, swore
to a complaint in Acting Police Judge
Barry's court yesterday for the arrest of
his son Frank, 24 years of age, on the
charge of liHng a common drunkard.
Frank had served sixty days on the same i
charge, and when he was released Mon
day he went home and thrashed his
mother. Then he pot drunk, and at night
kicked in the front door. He is in the
habit of beating both his parents when
he gets "full," which is almost daily.

the education of women, in next
Sunday's Call.

His Rupture Cured.
C. & N. W. Engineer Restored by
the Wonderful Rice Method.
Member of Waseca, Division No. 9,
Tells How He Was Cured.
One of the old timers on the C. & N. W.,
having been In their employ over 29 years, .re-
lates some very interesting facts about how
he cured himself of rupture by the well-known
nice method. His name if 11. A. Read, a mem-
ber in good standing of Waseca Division No. 9,
B. L. V... so what he says for the benefit of
other railroad men who are ruptured can be
relied upon as truthful and of value. Mr. Read
says: "I had as bad a rupture as you will run
across in many months, but the Dr. Rice Truss
\\ â¢> .?.lUibu. r<f*-^Jr
H. A. READ.
*nd Lymphol cured me. It was a hard rupture
to hold, as I had to jump on and off my engine
so often, the spring and other kind of trusses
I wore would shift and let the rupture out.
Hut the Rice truss fitted me exactly, and after
,the first night 1 wore It I knew it would cure
me. 1 went to sleep feeling like a new man,
, as the truss held my rupture, no matter what
I did or the way I moved about. I never lobt
one hour from work, and as I am a railroad
engineer it means considerable to be laid uu
with a rupture. I have save $100 already in the
time I have made up, and I shall always
recommend the Rice cure with a grateful
heart. Sincerely, H. A. READ, Waseca, Minn.
The Rice method is a perfect fitting truss, the
only one known, and a marvelous healing lotion
â¢hat securely knits and binds the broken
muscles together, making the cure complete
and permanent. Every ruptured railroader
should write to Dr. W. S. Rice. 418 X Main
street, Adams, N. V., and he will send a com-
plete and Illustrated series .if pamphlets show-
ing conclusively that his method cannot fail to
cure. It is a home treatment at small costs,
without pain, danger, operation or an hour's
detention from work. Do not fail to. write for
either yourself or some one you know to be
ruptured.

tified that the young woman had ad
mitted to him that she shot her nusband.
"Later, on our way to the Receiving
Hospital." continued "Witness Conrad,
"we had another conversation. She
wanted to know where she was being
taken, and wanted me to take her to
her mother's on Filbert street. San Fran
ciSCO. 1 told her it was wrong the way
she shot her husband, and she replied,
â¢If a man slapped yon and knocked you
down and threatened to choke you
wouldn't you shoot him?' "
Witness then related a further conver
sation bad at the Receiving Hospital In
this city, where Mrs. Mentel'a self-in
flicted wound was dressed. "She was
asked by Detective Herbert why she had
shot her husband." continued Chief Con
rad, "but she told him to go to her hus
band; he would probably tell him every
thing. She did not know until the next
day that Mentel was dead.
"In the presence of Dr. I'ortrr and my
self Detective Herbert then asked Mrs.
Mentel as to what conversation was had
during the trouble with her husband. She
replied simply, "It is too horrible to re
peat.' I then left the room. There was
nothing in her manner to show malice i
or hatred toward deceased."
Incidentally Witness Conrad testified to
minor details of the arreest; of Mrs.
Mentel being taken first to Dr. Lub
bock's house, near the scene of the shoot- j
ing; of the finding of the revolver, the
victim's hat, Mrs. Mentel's hat, a bun
dle and a satchel all lying near the body
of th< deail man.
George D. Gray, an Alameda constable:
J. L. Hicks, motorman on the car that
Mrs. Mentel hailed on the fateful niprht. i
and Captain L. W. Looney, who was a
passenger on the car, next testified in tho
order given, but their testimony
brought out no now facts from those
published at the time of the preliminary
hearing.
Took His Own Medicine.
OAKLAND. April A. -Dr. O. D. Hamlin.
a memher of the Board of Health, has
been arrests for violating the ordinance
forbidding expectoration on the sidewalks.
I>r. Ifamlin was one of the members who
worked hard for the passage of the or
dinance and is the second man to be ar
rested for its violation. The doctor de
posited $2 for bail at the City Prison,
which will probably be declared forfeited
In court to-morrow.
DINGEE WILL NOT
CONTROL THE COMBINE
CONTRA COSTA MAY STOP AL
VARADO PLANT.
An Effort to Be Made to Pay a Divi
dend for the Purpose of Giving
the Stock a Better
Price.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 4.
, i William J. Dinpee will not control the
! consolidated water companies. lie will
', not havp a voico in Its annual mpotlnpr,
to be held next Tuesday, nor will he rep
' resmt any shares of stock in the concern.
It has been generally supposed that
1 with his 15,000 shares of stock and the j
dissatisfied section of the Contra Costa j
shareholders Mr. Dingee could do as he j
pleased at the annual meeting. This is
j incorrect. The final act in the consollda
i tion of the two companies cannot be car
ried out until after the annual election
: <if directors. Until the combination Is
effected Mr. Dingoe will have no stock
j in the Contra Costa company, for its is
suance n.iist be authorized by a vote
' next Tuesday.
As soon us the deal is concluded, and
there is absolutely no doubt that it will
i be, Mr. Dingee will receive his stock, but
; by that time the annual election v,i!l have
been hold and he will not be entitled to
any voice in the matter.
I'urinK the past few days Contra Costa
stock lias Increased a few dollars in value
and Is now exchanging hands at G6Vi.
This enhanced value of the shares is
I arousing great Interest in view of the fact
1 that In ,ooo more shares will be put on the
\ market In a short time. As the company
j has" paid no dividends for years, and as
the water rate to be enforced for the next
fiscal year Is somewhat lower than that
j now In force, it is difficult to see how it
can produce an income which will pay
dividends on twice the amount of stock
at present issued.
After the two corporations are consoli
dated th.- office expenses of the Dingee
company will, of course, be saved, and
this will decrease the expenses, but the
cost of operation of the artesian system
at Alvarado will remain the same unless
with Its present supply of water at Lake
Chabot the Contra Costa Company
should connect the mains of the two com
panies and avoid the heavy expense of
pumping water into Oakland from Al
varado.
There 1b no doubt that everything will
be done to make it possible to pay a
dividend In the near future, In view of
the new Issue of stock.
THE SAIN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1899.
ELOPEMENT IS
FOLLOWED IT
A DIVORCE SUIT
Martin Johnson Seeks
a Separation.
HIS HAPPY HOME DESTROYED
INVITED A FRIEND AND HIS
WIFE BECAME SMITTEN.
Minnie E. Campbell of Alameda Also
Tells of Her Husband's Infi
delity in a Complaint
for Separation.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 4.
Two sensational divorce suits were filed
In the Superior Court to-day. In each
the ground alleged for the cause of ac-
tion is the Infidelity of the spouse's de
fendant, and likewise two erstwhile
happy homes have been destroyed of all
peace. Martin Johnson is a well-to-do
ship carpenter, and until a few months
ago resided with his wife, Elizabeth
Johnson, in a cosy cottage in Lorin. He
had an intimate friend, whose name,
however, does not appear In his com
plaint tiled this afternoon. The confi
dence he placed in this "friend" was so
Implicit that he invited him to enjoy the
comforts of a home in his little Lorin
cottage. The "friend" accepted the prof
fered hospitality and now Johnson rues
the day.
His wife became Infatuated with the
friend, and when he finally remonstrated
with her over the improprieties of trans
ferring her affect inns, she eloped with
the new-comer taking with her most of
the household furniture and, acording to
Johnson's attorney. Moses Cobb, the orr
lrip wife is now residing In Oakland bask
ing In the smiles of her husband's confi
dential friend.
In a complaint prepared by her attor
ney, Howard K. James, Minnie E. Camp
bell of Alameda tells of the Infidelity of
her husband. Lewis V). Campbell. The
latter is a printer, whose occupation in
a Han Francisco printing establishment
keeps him out late of nights, so that he
very frequently "misses the last boat,"
Mrs. Campbell, it appears, had a close
watch plat ed over her husband, and
thouprh she does not allege a co-respond
ent by name, shf avers that another
woman Is at the bottom of It all, where
fore she asks for a divorce.
MRS. ETTA BRANDES
MUST STAND TRIAL
JUDGE HALL WOULD NOT DIS
MISS A MURDER CASE.
Efforts of Her Attorneys to Secure
Her Release Prove in Vain
Before Judge Hall.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 4.
Judpe Hall to-day refused to dismiss
the case against Mrs. Etta Brandes,
charppd with complicity in the murder of
her stepdauphter Lillian. When the mat
ter was called up in court to-day her at
torney, F. W. Sawyer, moved that the
charge he dismissed, on the ground that
she could not be convicted If her hushani
â¢was guilty. Judge Hall, however, ruled
that two persons might easily be gruilty
of the same crime.
Attorney Sawyer next moved for a dis
missal on the ground that District Attor
ney Alien has no further evidence to con
nect Mrs. Hrandes with the crime; but to
this District Attorney Allen entered a
vigorous denial, expressing his readiness
also to go ahead. The case, how sver,
owing to the Mentel murder trial being
set for to-day, was continued for two
weeks to be set for trial.
At the request of Attorney Bennett, for
the defense, the court ordered that new
alcohol be poured into the bottle contain
ing the dura mater of Lillian's skull. At
torney Bennett had reported that the
liquid was evaporating and the substance
changing color.
KtLLED ON THE TRACK
John Martin's Fatal Ride on His
Velocipede.
OAKLAND, April 4.â John Martin, a
section hand on the Southern Pacific, was
killed this morning in a collision between
his railroad velocipede and the local train.
Martin was on his way to the mole this
morning on the velocipede, and owing to
a dense fog which hung over the bay he
did not see the local train approaching
him. His machine was struck by the en
gine and Martin was thrown into the
mud. When the train crew picked him up
he was still breathing, but his skull was
crushed and he died on the way to the
hospital. Martin was unmarried and 35
years of age.

Â© It is not unlikely that the near future may see all the leased +

Â© President Huntington in an interview yesterday. -f
ColUs P. Huntington never sleeps on his
victories but keeps marching right on to
new on<-s. Hardly bad he completed the
deal whereby he prevented the Central
Pacific from slipping from his control
when he began planning measures to in
sure profitable returns for that and his
Other railroad properties, in addition to
his expressed purpose of making the
people of California pay the debts of his
railroads.
Ever since the Panama route between
Pacific and Atlantic ports has been op
erated it has been a menace and check on
high transcontinental freight rates, as it
is possible to make lower rates by way of
Panama than by any ail rail route, owing
to the long water carriage. At the pres
me thero is a contract between the
Pact! amshlp Company, which
is controlled bj Huntington, and the
Panama Steamship Company, the re
sult of a compromise between those two
corporations after a long and bitter fight.
by means of which rates are maintained
at such figures between Pacific and At
lantic ports as make it possible for the
tram- railroads to compete
with the Panama route for through busi-
It Is a matter of common knowledge in
railroad circle? that the Panama Steam
ship Company, which operates the rail-
Isthmus of Panama and
the I inters between .vsjiinwall
and New York, in conjunction with the
Mail Bteamera that ply between
Ban Francisco and Panama, has been
greatly dissatisfied with the iprms of the
existing contract. It is claimed that the
; discriminates In favor of way
business and against through business to
the Injury of the Panama Steamship
<ny. The reason for this is alleged
to be twofold. The Pacific Mail receives
considerably better rates for way freight
â  n Sar, Francisco and Central
American ports than it does for its share
of the through business carried to Pan
i-.mn. and by diverting traffic from the
Panama route It is forced to seek the all
rail route, mostly over the Huntington
lines.
The friction between the Pacific Mail
ar.d the Panama company has been gTow-
Ing greater, and it is considered improba
ble that a renewal of the present rela
wlll be arranged when the present
comr.v! expires. The probabilities are
that the Panama people may undertake,
to again operate an independent compet
ing line between New York and Pacific
â¢ ports, as it did before entering into
the existing combination with the Pacific
Mail, it is for such a contingency that
Huntington is evidently preparing. The
first st<--p toward future action independ
ent of the Panama line and other eompeti
was mentioned in the following dis-
T-'itch from New Orleans published in The
Call yesterday:
C. P. Huntinpton's agent left on the steamer
this evening for Port Barrios, Guatemala, to
complete the purchase "i the Guatemala and
Northern Railroad, on which there Is a break
of sixty miles between Port Barrios and Guate
mala City. This break will be completed by
JJuntlnston, and with the line to San Jose that
he has also purchased, will Rive him a line to
the Pacific. The road will lx> operated in con
nection with ii line of steamers from New Or
leans which will run to Port Barrios in two
and a half days, giving Huntlngtnn a line by
water and rail from New Orleans to the Pacific
In four days.
The carrying out of the plans here out
lined will give a through line between
th< Atlani tciflc seaboards that
will be much shorter than the Panama
route and less expensive to operate than
any now existing with the exception of
Ipper route by way of the Horn. In
order to perfeel the transportation chain
between New Orleans or New York and
Isco it will be only necessary
to havi th( Pacific Mail steamers on this
conned with the (Guatemala road
et San Jose riV Guatemala. In order to
ascertain how far these negotiations had
been carried and the significance of the
deal Mr. Huminpton was interviewed.
"Are the statements contained in the
dispatch from New Orleans pertaining to
the Guatemala and Northern Railroad
correct V" he was asked.
"There are some negotiations going
on." he said, "but nothing has been com
pleted a.Â« yet."
"Will not this new line by way of Guate
mala be operated in connection with the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company in pref
f-rrr.'^ to the present Panama route for
through business?"
"All this is premature, a,s there is noth
ing in the world but talk as yet."
The consummation of this plan will not
only give Huntington the whip hajid of
LIE WAU FOOLS
HER VILE KEEPER
LIE WAT', a pretty slave girl of 20 summers, cleverly eluded yesterday
the keepers of the vile den In which she was imprisoned, and with the
kindly aid of Miss Lake of the Methodist Mission managed to be we il
on her way to the Flowery Kingdom before her masters knew exactly
what had happened.
Lie Wav planned all the details of her ep^-apo herself and the cun
ning devices of her Oriental brain carried her scheme to a most successful
issue.
Several dayi ago Miss I^nke received word by means of a trusted agent
that Lie Wav would escape the vile life of the Ross' alley den and prayed
Miss T,*ke to assist her in the attempt. Acting according; to the little Mon
golian's Instructions Miss Lake, accompanied by Mr. Shannon of the Califor
nia Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children, was waiting in a carriage
yesterday at noon at the corner of Jackson and Stockton streets. Lie Wan
came strolling: by, recognized Miss Lake by the white neckdress of her
order, pave a prearranged signal and was soon within the hack that wa.s
making for the filthy den in Ross alley, where all the belongings of the
poor slave girl were.
At the sliding floor of the den of vice Officer Shannon crouched in the
shadow, while Lie jrnvo the required mystic knocks. As the door swung nn
its hinges Shannon came to the front, marched with the trembling- slave
pirl to the room where all her belongings were, gathered them up and made
way again to the- waiting carriage. The driver whipped up his horses and

Shannon and Mies Lake safely landed their charge aboard the China steamer.
the Panama company, but will virtually
give him the key to the entire transcon
tinentnl rate situation. Rates by way of
Guatemala Will become the basis for fix
ing freights on all the transcontinental
i railroads.
His greater schemes have not distract
: erl the attention of the railroad magnate
from matters of closer interest to Califor
| nians. He has evidently not given up
hope of making Santa Monica the rival
of Sr>.n Pedro as the harbor of Southern
California. He had intimated as much in
a previous interview with The Call cor
respondent at Tjos Angeles. On this sub
ject he was asked the following question:
"In connection with a published state
ment a.ttibuted to you that Santa Monica
is going to be the harbor of Southern Cal
ifornia and that nothing can prevent it,
â¢ will you please state what improvements
: will be made at that point by the South
ern Pacific i ompany or other corporation
in which you are interested and when?"
His reply was: 'i don't want to talk
about that. Tim" will tell what will hap
; pen at Santa Monica."
"Is It the intention to extend the coast
division line to Santa Monica by connect
; ing it direct with Ventura, or some point
near Ventura, on the coast division route,
1 and when will work on this extension
probably begin?"
"I don't know what can be done down
there, as we have never made a thorough
I survey there. Probably such a survey
will be made at. some time in the future."
The extension of the coast line to Santa
Monica would place that town on an Im
portant main road, instead of its being the
I terminus of a very short and unimportant
1 spur. It would be in a position to become
a considerable entrepot.
"What will be the effect of time sched
ules and fares between San Francisco and
J.os Angeles when trains are operated by
way of San Luis Obispn and Santa Bar
| bara?" asked the reporter.
"The effect cannot be otherwise than
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 1899.
beneficial. As far as schedules are con- !
cerned. I don't know yet what speed can |
be made with safety."
"What will be' the effect on the towns
and coast section generally when this new j
coast route Is in operation?"
"It is sure to be very beneficial."
He. maintained his- well-earned reputa
tion as an artist in evasion in answering
the last question propounded.
"Is it proposed to consolidate the pres
ent leased lines of the Southern Pacific
Company in this State,- or any of them?"
"Joint ownerships are generally just as â 
good, and accomplish about the same i
thing as consolidation."
The annual meeting of the stockholders j
of the Southern Pacific Company will he â¢
held at noon to-day. The principal busi
ness will be the election of directors for
the ensuing year. On the following day
the directors will elect officers. The in
dications are that there will be but one j

TOURED THE EAST
FOR CALIFORNIA
BOOMED THE STATE BY WORDS
AND PICTURES.
An Enterprise That Is Intended to
Bring a Highly Desirable Class
of Immigrants.
California has had a four months' sea
son of eloquent and picturesque advertis
ing throughout the Eastern States
through the medium of Miss Helen Kel
leher, a well-known elocutionist and dra
matic reader. She made the tour of the
I'nlted States to lecture on the health,
wealth and beauty of California under the
auspices of some of the most influential
commercial bodies of the State, aided by
the Southern Pacific Company.
Her lecture was illustrated by 200 mag
nificently colored views, displayed by
moans oi the largest stereopticon ever
made. She began her tour on December 1,
1898, and returned to this city yesterday.
It was marked by a series of great suc
cesses, the lectures. having been attended
by very large and enthusiastic audiences.
Among some of the prominent cities vis
ited were Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul,
Cleveland, Oraml Rapids. Detroit, Colum
bus. Dayton, Albany. Rochester, Qtica,
Buffalo, Troy, Providence, Baltimore,
Washington, Philadelphia. Louisville, St.
Louts, Kansas City, Topeka and New
York City.'
These lectures have been given in every
instance before # influential organizations.
and the best class of people comprised th"
attendance. The interest in California
was greater than expected, and to some
of the cities the lady had to make as
many as thr<--o separate visits. It is be
lleved thai the result of her tour will be
â¢â < large Increase in 'the number of home
seekers, healthseekers and tourists who
will come to this State. Tt is possible
that she may be sent on a similar mission
to Europe.

he stated that he had been serve'] with a
subpena addressed to William P. Reddins
ton. H<- had an uncle fn the same firm
whose name was W. P. Reddington.
Attorney Ach at once moved that the
entire venire of 100 be discharged, as there
was no such person as W. P. Reddington
and therefore the full 100 had not been
summoned. Even though it was admitted
there was a W. P. Redinprton (here was
no such man as W. P. Reddington. The
Judge overrultd the objection and excused
W. S. Redington, and Attorney Ach took
an exception.
Several jurors did not answer to their
names, and that gave. Ach another oppor
tunity to except because their names had
been in the box and they were not pres

for the ahsent jurors.

ent of the Sunday school and one of the
deacons in the First Presbyterian Church,
it was received as a shock, softened only
by the knowledge that the bullet had
missed its mark.
The houso ai 2216 Ellswprth street, East
Berkeley. Into Which the bullet was firer],
was the renter of attraction yesterday for
a large number of sightseers, who Found
it hard to associate ilie vine-covered
dwelling with a tragic occurrence. The
hole in the dining room window pane was
not to he grit over, however. It was there
plainly to show that the assassin had sped
his bullet from the dark at the unsus-

pectlng occupant of the dwelling. That
ho did not hit him may have been from
design, or it may have been from acci
dent, the warning note left under the
door now inclining Mr. Sell and the ofli
cers who have been looking into the mat
ter to the first theory.
It has been established to the satisfac
tion of Marshal Lloyd and the detectives
whom Mr. Sell put in possession of the
facts that the man who fired the shot
was not in the yard at 2_'lH Ellsworth
street when he pulled the trigger. Jn the
hrst place, he could have found no posi
tion in the narrow garden from which he
could have held hir. weapon In position to
speed the bullet on the line it took, as in
dicated by the hole in the window pane,
and the corresponding hole in the plaster-
Ing on the opposite wall. In addition to
this there are evidences on the adjoining
premises to the south that the person fir
ing upon Mr. Sell pulled the trigger while
standing there. The place, which la
known as the Bates Gymnasium proper! y,
has long been disused, the grass having
entirely overgrown it to the depth of a
foot. In this grass, about the middle of
the yard and twenty feet to the south ajid
a little to the rear of Sell's dining room
window, the officers found evidences of
recent human intrusion. It was trampled
down in a small circle, from which the
shot, oven then, must have been fired by a
tall man to take the lino it did. Leading
from this trampled spot to the rear Ka!<
opening to Atherton street -was found a
trail through the grass undouhtedlv mado
by the unknown ruffian. Beyond the gate
tht-re was nothing to show the direction
he had taken.
Mr. Sell and Hugh J. Dykes, the inven
tor, who was with him when the bullet
came whistling through the window pane,
are certain now that had they reached
the garden quicker they would have seen
nothing of the marksman. There was
nothing t.i Indicate to them at that time
that the Bhot trad been fired from any
place Imt the Sells garden, and while
tiny were examining it their man, if he
had not fled previously, could have made
off Bafely and silently almost under their
very noses. As it was. they were too
much perturbed at the evidence that an
attempt had been made i>n the life of one
of tlvm to have started the search in the
right direction unless by accident.
The. second shock recelvi d during the
evening by Mr. Sell and Mr. Dykes was
when they retraced their steps to the
dining-room. In the hallway they found
a warning note. They had not noticed
it on their way out and the moment they
read it- the same thought must hav< oc
curred to both that some person had
stolen into the hallway while they were
searching in the garden. This theory was
dissipated when they raine to consider
that it could just as easily have been
slipped underneath the door before the
shot was fired, the fact that they had
not noticed it on going out being due to
the excitement (ncideni to the shi
The note was not written, the words
being printed with lead pencil, the spon
sor for it taking that means to baffle at
tempts at the discovery of his identity.
In one instance, however, ho forgot his
cunning-, and a letter or two In a natural
hand wore written on the paper.. Wheth
er or nr.t this slip will ever lead to the am
n st of the culprit is too remote a chance
for the officers to take. The note, which
still remains in the possession of Mr. Sell,
reads:
WARNING!
Have $300 for a person who will call
for it. Don't mention tin's to any one
or the next shot will go nearer home.
While the wording of this ominous mis
sive, with its sugg.-stion of another shot,
does not tend to give Mr. Sell any feel
ings of joy, he and his friends see in it
the solace that no trigger will be snapped
at him until he has had a chance to fork
over that $300. Marsha! Lloyd does not
see that much in it. He is of the opinion
that the noir was written and the shot
fired by some person disliking Mr. Sell,
not for the purpose of paving the way
for blackmail, but to give him a bad
quarter of an hour.
Mr. Sell, who was working on his books
yesterday in the office of Alvinza Hay
ward as if lie had never been a human
target, continues reticent concerning the
affair. H>-> refused to show the warning
note and referred all callers to his at
torney, .1. M. Whitworth. In turn. Mr.
Whitworth thought that the matter had
been fully exploited in The Call. Hugh
J. Dykes, who was with Mr. Sell when
the bullet punctuated their conversation,
is now in Sonora.
