SMITH IN POSSESSION
OF HIS GOVERNMENT
BACOLOD, Negros Island, March
4, via Manila, March 9. After a
pleasant voyage the steamship
St. Paul, carrying the deputa
tion from Negros Island, Colonel
James F. Smith, first American Gov
ernor of Negros, and the First Battal
ion of the First California Regiment,
Major Slme commanding, arrived at
Iloilo- on March 3. As the vessel entered
the harbor at midday it found the ar
tillery in action and General Miller's
command advancing into the cocoanut
plantations at the right of the Amer
. ican line.
I learned from the officers on the
cruise: Boston that General Miller,
fearing an organized and strong attack
upon the town, had requested assist
ance in lar ling. Captain Wilde was
unable to accede to this request, owing
to the fact that a portion of his crew
was at Cebu.
It was at first expected that the Call
fornians would land and assist General
Miller's forces, but on landing I met
General Miller returning from the front
and learned that it was only a false
alarm.
Hollo was terribly wrecked by the in
surgent incendiaries and presents a
scene of desolation. Magnificent resi
dences and great warehouses were to
tally destroyed. General Miller and his
staff are confident they can hold the
town. The insurgent strength is not
definitely known, but it is believed that
there are 20 0 men armed with fire
arms and 2000 .men. They follow
similar tactics to those of -the natives
at Manila, dropping irritating shots
into the American lines throughout the
night, but never appearing in sufficient
strength to justify a resolute forward
movement. Few casualties are reported.
The St. Paul proceeded to Bacolod
and arrived at noon to-day. Company
A landed with Major Sime and myself.
We found a native guard of honor
drawn up on the beach and President
I.ar?"n of the local native Government,
whose party had arrived the previous
night, received us. The inhabitants
were amiably disposed and the Amer
ican nag was already flying from an
unfinished convent. All were prepared
for the reception of our troops.
Captain Millay of the Signal Corps
landed immediately and within half an
hour had reopened communication with
Iloilo by cable. The following message
was sent over:
The Governor, Congress and inhabitants
of Negros Island to General Miller. Iloilo:
We affectionately salute you and con
gratulate yourselves upon the happy ar
rival of Colonel Smith and the troops
under your orders, and beg you to send
this salutation to General Otis as the rep
resentative of the Government of the
L'nited States at Manila.
ANICITO LACSON.
Later in the afternoon Colonel Smjth
landed. lie was received with full
military honors by the native and Am
erican troops, the native band playing
a salute on the beach. Colonel Smith
was most cordially and enthusiastic
ally received, and as he has full power
to establish the native administration
under American control it will be in
teresting to watch this experiment to
gain the good will of the native race
and establish peace ajjain in these
beautiful islands.
As the landing is extremely difficult,
the natives carried Colonel Smith
ashore from his launch in a bamboo
chair amidst renewed and continued
cheers of the populace.

Special Dispatch to The fall.
NEW YORK, March 9.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs: Instead of being seriously
ill. Admiral Dewey, according to re
ports brought to the Navy Department
by officers just returned from the
Asiatic station, is in excellent health
ana* desires to continue in his present
command.
Secretary Long told me to-day he has
never received from Admiral Dewey
any intimation which would lead him
to believe that that officer is ill or de
sirous of returning to the United
States.
"In fact," he said, "all. the informa
tion we have is just the other way. The
admiral knows that if he desires to re
turn he can do so at any time, and that
the department will willingly Issue or
ders to this end."
Mrs. Lee, who recently returned from
Manila, where she met the admiral on
board the Olympia, informed Secretary
Long several weeks ago that the only
change she found in the admiral's ap
pearance from that when she saw him
ln Washington was that his hair had
become white. Physically, she said, he
seemed in excellent condition.
Commander E. P. Wood, recently re
lieved from the command of the Petrel,
told the Secretary and other officials of
the department that Admiral Dewey's
health was excellent, and his statement
was confirmed by Lieutenant Com
mander C. P. Rees. who recently re
turned home from the Olympia.

MANILA. March 10.â The

General Lawton is expected to arrive

General Lawton, with Ids splendid rec

BLACKMAIL OF PAUSE

The French Authorities Seeking
to Make Light of the
Whole Affair.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 9.â London anar
chists assert that the responsibility for
the explosion in Toulon arsenal on Sun
day belongs to them. A French police
agent, who, under pretense of being
an anarchist, obtained their confidence,
found an elaborate plan of the Toulon
arsenal at the rooms of an anarchist
club in Dean street and also learned
that the dynamite cartridges used to
blow up *-'-.: magazine were obtained
from a quarry at -?-Â»~e_ near the Italian
frontier.
The same Investigator affirms that he
has obtained evidence of a successful
scheme of blackmail which has been
worked by the militant anarchists in I
the past two . ears. The plan is to ap- j
proach prominent personages by means
of a gentlemanly scoundrel who has
sufficient standing to obtain an inter
view. The caller submits a promise,
written on thin paper, guaranteeing to
the person approached Immunity from
all anarchist attacks upon the payment
of a specified sum, at the same time
saying, blandly: "It is useless to ar- j
rest me. If you make a hostile move
I shall swallow the paper and you can j
prove nothing. Besides it will cost you j
your life."
The demands have been so care
fully and skillfully made that they have ;
been successful eight times out of ten.
The tte President Faure paid*2o.ooo
francs for immunity and others -id in |
proportion to prominence. The funds l
thus collected have been deposited in
Switzerland, and, it is said, aggregate
a large sum.
It has become necessary to resume an
active anarchist campaign for advertis- j
ing purposes, and it is intimated that j
Paris will be the scene of the next dem- ;
onstration. it
PARIS, March Gaulois publishes

IRELAND IS
TO BE MADE
A CARDINAL
Celebrated Churchman De
fines the Real Meaning
of "Americanism."
LONDON, March 10.â The Rome correspondent of the Post says;
Since the recovery of the Pope the question of 'â¢Americanism" is be
ing eagerly discussed. The Pope's letter to Cardinal Gibbons was
prepared by Cardinal Satolli and Cardinal Camillo Mazzella, Prefect
of the Congregation of Sacred Rights, both of whom are strong ene
mies of Cardinal Gibbons and Archbishop Ireland, and the letter was
an absolute condemnation, in the original, of all American tendencies.
The Pope and Cardinal Rampolla, Papal Secretary of State, cut, ex
purgated and added to the draft until it was unrecognizable by the
authors Neither side is completely satisfied, but the real victory re
mains with the Americans, and it is said that the red hat will be be
stowed upon Archbishop Ireland as a mark of the Pope's approval.
LONDON, March 10.â The. Rome cor
respondent o-f the Daily Chronicle
telegraphs the substance of an in
terview he has had with Arch
bishop Ireland, in which the latter ex
plains his attitude toward "Hecker
ism" and his course during the Span
ish-American war. He describes Arch
bishop Ireland as having the "stem,
benevolent face of an apostle" and as
"terribly in earnest." remarking that
"the following colloquy may be taken
as a message to his friends and a reply
to the misinterpretations which, though
unintentional, he considers damaging
to a great cause." The correspondent
continues:
Archbishop Ireland expressed reluct
ance to enter upon a discussion of deli
cate questions; which, as he observed,
only time can lear up, but he said he ac
cepted this opportunity to dispel wrong
views and to give in a nutshell the max
ims considered essential to the human
working of the church.
The Archbishop then proceeded in this
wise:
Let me begin by disconnecting me new
word "Heckerism." 1 knew Father
Hecker well* and, like great minds, he
had views peculiar to himself. One of
these was the direct inspiration of the
Holy Ghost. This apparently daring doc
trine meant little more than godly -help
is not wanting to those displaying Initia
tive I frequently told him he was am
biguous and would be misunderstood and
this has happened. . . ; - .
Archbishop Ireland proceeded to ex
plain the Importance attached to the
natural virtues and said:
We maintain especially regarding the
rlererv that temperance and truthfulness,
frfr fn4r.ee. are so necessary that tbey
cannot be replaced by any purely devo
tional fidelity. An . intemperate - priest
eternizes his mission. A priest who
_Â.;.. personal casuistry to prevarica
tion and mental reserve only justifies the
enemies of the church in affirmations
which, though false, are heard lar and
wide.
The Archbishop then warmly pro
! tested against what he described as the
i groundless charge that he is inimical to
i the religious orders. He said he be
lieved ere was no nobler ideal con
ceivable than the monastic vows, but
he objected to parochial or educational
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
encroachments by the "regular" clergy,
those identified with religious orders or
bound by monastic vows, upon the
"secular" clergy, those not identified or
bound. The episcopacy and its sub
hierarchy were, he said, the real foun
dation of ecclesiastical work.
Referring to "the attempts the Jesuits
had made in the United States to pre
vent the establishment of the Catho
lic University at Washington, he said:
They wanted it themselves, but the
Pope pointedly warned me not to allow
the American Bishops to be caught in
their toils. My views on this subject aro
identitcal with the late Cardinal Man
ning's. To insinuate that Americanism
means the transformance of the religious
orders to the melting pot is a calumny.
They have produced countless saints and
have their own exalted mission, but
American Catholicism requires a priest
hood deeply imbued with natural and
civic virtues.
With reference to the war Archbishop
Ireland said:
Before it broke out I was pro-Spanish;
but when hostilities commenced 1 forgot
everything, except that I was an Ameri
can citizen, anointed to love and to serve
my country.
He could say nothing regarding the
disarmament congress. He might be
one of two representatives, or there
might be another and higher solution.
"I am at the double service," he re
marked, "of my spiritual offic-: and
temporal citizenship."
It would be impossible to reproduce
the flowing, sparkling French of the il
lustrious churchman whose elevation to
the cardinalate has only been adjourn
ed by the Fope's illness. â

NEW YORK, March 9.â The follow

French translation of his life, was is
sued to-day:
"As soon as the Pope's letter to Car

I sent a telegram to Cardinal Rampolla

to Rome prescribed for the fathers.
"When a new edition of the 'Life of
Father Hecker' is prepared it will em
phasise the Pope's teaching and con

None of the members of the Paulist

BURNS REPUDIATES
McLAUGHLIN'S ACTION
IN THE GREEN CASE
Dibble Follows His Master's Orders
And Makes a Change of Front.
GRANT MEN NOT CAUGHT WITH CHAFF
The Mexican Cannot Get the Followers of the
San Diegan to Turn the Stone While
He Grinds His Political Ax,
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 9.- This morning Dan
M. urns called upon Ulysses S. Grant
Jr. at his apartments in the Golden
Eagle Hotel and utterly repudiated the
action taken against Milton J. Green
yesterday in the Assembly by the
Burns forces under the leadership of
Frank. McLaughlin and Assemblymen
Dibble and Johnson.
This afternoon Assemblyman Dibble,
always the leader of the Burns faction
on the floor, prefaced the usual order of
business with a glittering eulogy of
Ulysses S. Grant and a resolution de
claring Mr. Green purged of all the
charges that have been brought against
him. He spoke- brilliantly to the reso
lution and utterly refuted every argu
ment he and his followers in the cause
of the Mexican made against an iden
tical measure presented yesterday.
Dibble's remarkable change of front,
the transformation in the aspect of the
entire Burns camp, the spectacle of
Dan M. Burns crawling on his knees at
the feet of their leader, were all so
sudden, unexpected and without prece
dent in their political experience, that
the Grant people are still agape and
wondering at the true significance of
the whole raw performance. But at the
tame time they are lined up more
solidly than ever against any under
hand scheme that the Mexican may be
meditating.
It was evident that the sympathy of
every member in the House was with
Dibble in the distasteful plight in
which his master's orders placed him.
Only yesterday, in speaking against a
motion to purge Green of contempt, he
said: "It is simply a question of
whether we are to disgrace this House
or whether we are not." To-day he
made the selfsame motion that he yes
terday branded as a disgrace, and in
speaking to it said: "I have never ac
cused the gentleman whose name has
been most mentioned in this affair of
wrongdoing in having extended assist
ance to candidates to this Legislature.
It has been an immemorial practice,
and there has never been any law
against it. It is high time we lifted
these charges."
Even his usual co-worker in things
pertaining to the Burns camp, Grove L.
Johnson, refused to stand by the
scheme which Dibble was forced to
father through the House. At the first
intimation of what c.as to come Mr.
Johnson escaped from the chamber and
did not return until Dibble's motion
had been carried. Then he explained
that he had a committee meeting to at
tend and to his regret was forced to be
absent for the first time when matters
of importance were being voted upon.
Jilson also declined to stand for the
scheme and threw his vote against it.
The Grant people gave no thanks for
this act of magnanimity on the part of
the Burns crowd toward the San
Diegan's political manager. Though
they did not know just what it all
meant it was patent to them that the
Mexican had an ax or so to grind, and
come what may they determined not
to turn the stone. The scene was a di
rect antithesis to that of yesterday.
The speeches made were those of Dib
ble, Fairweather, Belshaw, Feliz and
Burnett. The Grant people kept their
seats, sullen and silent, but just as
angry' as yesterday, and it was evident
that Burns had lost rather than gained
by his latest raw maneuver. Only one
of them got up to speak, and that was
Huber. His speech was of no length,
but It voiced the unanimous sentiment
of the Grant camp. He said he would
come to no compromise with Dan Burns
and would vote against Green's relief
if necessary rather than do so. He
counseled every one of Grant's people
to take the same stand, and If consist
ency permitted they would have done
so. As it was there were a number of
them who declined to vote at all. They
were Cargill, Radcliff, Blood, Raub,
Bliss and Clark. Ex-Speaker Wright
was present in the chamber, but de
clined to vote. That little $1650 transac
tion of his with Mr. Green was too
fresh in his memory to warrant his
mingling in a matter that struck so
close home.
Dibble's speech, upon presenting his
resolution, was a remarkable effort. It
demonstrated not only the speaker's
eloquence but his remarkable versatil
ity in being compelled to speak as con
vincingly upon one side of a question
as upon the other and with only a
scant twenty-four hours intervening.
Just before he began Mr. Foley brought
in a message from the Governor an
nouncing that Mr. Dibble's bill making
it a felony for any Senatorial aspirant
to assist legislative candidates with
money had . been signed with a great
deal of pleasure by the Executive, and
referring to this Dibble said:
"It seems to me that this is an op
portune time to pass such a resolution
as I have just sent to the desk and ter
minate these proceedings that have
dragged along for weeks and weeks
and done much to prevent the election
of a United States Senator.
"It has been known by every mem
ber Of the House that certain practices
have been pursued by Senatorial candi
dates to assist candidates to this Legis
lature in their election. In this connec
tion I want to say that I do not believe
or have ever said that any law has
been broken in doing so or any wrong
done. It has been a practice from time
immemorial for any one who had an
interest in the party to assist legisla
tive candidates. It is to be regretted
that such a practice has existed, but it
has, and it has become political cus
tom. -
"But now I think a. new era has
dawned in politics. We have just re
ceived word that the Executive has ap
proved my bill, which will make the
giving of such assistance a felony. We
cnn hope to see this practice abolished
with the going out of this Legislature,
and 7 think the time has come to get
rid of these proceedings and leave the
old era behind.
"It gives me great pleasure to say,
concerning the gentleman so often men
tioned in this case, the son of the most
distinguished soldier of modern times,
whose memory is cherished by all na
tions,, that 1 have never said and I have
never allowed to be said that he has
been guilty of anything that would tar
nish his name, and to demonstrate my
cordial feelings and friendship 1 hope
that this resolution I have offered will
prevail."
The applause came from the Burns
people; the Grant faction sat quiet and
uninterested to hear what Mr. Fair
weather, who next claimed the floor,
had to say.
"This reminds me," said he, "of that
old hymn. -While the light holds out to
burn the vilest sinner may return,' "
and the Grant people warmed up
enough to laugh.
"It gives me great pleasure." con
tinued he, "to second the motion of my
friend Dibble, and I am glad he has
come over to the right side."
Then Mr. Burnett of San Luis Obispo
got up. It was only the raw aspect of
the whole proposition that appealed to
Burnett and in saying so he subjected
Dibble to a scoring that no other mem
ber on the floor has ever dared indulge
in. Speaking directly to Dibble he asked
why this sudden reversal of his own
decree, what the incentive. Broadly he
insinuated it could be no honorable one.
He called up Dibble's rabid remark of
yesterday "that Green's dismissal
would mean the disgrace of the House."
Shaking his finger menacingly at
Burns' agent he shouted: "If you so
reverse yourself there is but one de
cision the people of the State of Cali
fornia will come toâ that coin did it,
coin and nothing else."
If death lay in the glance of an eye.
Burnett's constituents .would shortly
have found it necessary to call a spe
cial election. Turning upon the man
who had dared to bait him. Dibble
said: "'There is an old French proverb
that fits the case of Mr. Burnett. It
is "Honi soit gui mal y pense*â evil be
to him who evil thinksâ if the gentle
man from San Luis Obispo. has been
looking for coin and has not found it
can he blame me."
"Do you mean to say that you have
found it?" retorted the angry Bur
nett.
"Dare you say I have?" shouted Dib
ble.
"Take you seat, Burnett," ordered
the Speaker.
"Honi soit gui mal y pense," repeated
Dibble, "by way of benediction.
The episode gave way to Feliz of
Monterey. "I admire the manhood of
the man from San Francisco. I admire
it," said Feliz. "No doubt he has given
much thought to this matter, since yes
terday. No doubt he has spent a
sleepless night in worrying over the
wrong he has done Mr. Green and has
come here to-day prepared to make
reparation. But I want to say that
this is nothing more nor less than a
scheme to elect to the Senate a cer
tain individual. I want to see a Sen
ator elected before I leave this place,
be he Democrat or Republican, but not
this man nor by these tactics."
Then Belshaw spoke along the same
line he pursued yesterday. He said
that to relieve Green would be- to ac
knowledge the Assembly had made a
mistake and was trying to get out of
it.
Speaker Anderson put Belshaw in the
chair and came down on the floor to
state his position. He said that he was
unalterably opposed to Green's relief
to-day, as he was yesterday and had
always been. He denied that his de
cisions of yesterday were arbitrary or
carried political significance. He had
acted and voted consistently and would
continue to do so on every matter ap
pertaining to the honor of the House
of which he was Speaker.
Then a roll call was demanded, and
it resulted as follows:

SENATE AMENDS THE
ELECTION LAW
CALL HEADQUARTERS,'. SACRA
MENTO, March 9.â Another election law,
parsed 'y tie Assembly, was passed by
the Senate this afternoon. ; It was a com
mittee, substitute: for Assembly Bill 911,
and provided for the forming of commit
tees to petition for a place on the pri
mary ballot. The Stratton law requires
that each political party which at the
previous election polled 3 per cent of the
vote shall petition for a' place on the pri
mary ballot through their governing com
mittee. There Is no provision in the law
which allows, them to petition except
through their committees, so to give a
chance to any party whicH may not have
a committee. Assembly bill 911 was in
troduced. It provides that in case there
is no committee, twenty-five of the elect
ors belonging to that party may form a
committee for the purpose of making
petition. â â '; -â â --' -2 2 yy.

BANKERS ESCAPE BY

parliamentary skirmishes the Senate has
seen this session was fought out to-day

from banks. '-y'-y.-.yj
Muenter's bill provided that the state

made on the same date. At present, the
one to the Bank Commissioners is made
on the first Monday In June and that to
the Assessor en % the first Monday in,

ond low, and the bill was for the purpose
of making them equal and having the
bank assessed at what it considered It was
worth before the commission. The bill
was beaten yesterdCj.^. and- the reconsid

COYOTE SCALP BILL
CAUSES DISSENSION
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. March :i.â The coyote scalp bill
may make music In tbe Assembly before
the measure la finally passed. The claim
ants under the net art not working In
harmony, at the following circular indi
cates:
\mi;.\'T<>. March 8, 1899.
Dear Sir: The Kotaey amendment to sub
stitute appropriation to pay coyote scalp
claimants la to be changed and the amount
reduo.v* from $2v7.*ir. to S-OO.tWO The latter
sum will pay every bones! claim. Under the
Kelsey amendment they can establish their
claims without coat, Mil they moat all come
Into one court, and the big claims based on
fraud and forgery will not flare materialize.
If presented they will be exposed and defeated
' under the plan of cross pleading allowed in the
I suit of Interpleader.
We have Indirectly heard that the money
; sharks and speculators are trying to patch up
the Senate substitute (the speculators bill)
and then get that dishonest measure through
the Assembly. The seductive amendment as
to Justices Courts and the duties of District
.Attorneys would ihmw wide open the flood
gates of fraud against the State without help
ing the bona fide claimants, wha have held on
to their claims. Â
That measure, If adopted, would allow a
holder of a talse and bogus claim to travel
from county to county and get a dozen or a
I hundred judgments against the state on one
and the same County Clerk's certificate.
It is. of course, preposterous to suppose any
District Attorney would or could attend to
thousands of actions brought before Justices,
at ii,,. game time any more than the Attorney
General could. Bui even if they did they could
do nothing under the circumstances.
The Controller li expected to disburse enor
mous sum: of money on Judgments certified by
I Justices of the Peace. ; It Is safe to predict.
! that judgments would be so certified aggregat
ing a million dollars.
What and whence th opposition to the Kel
sey amendment, which affords every protection
' to the State and to every honest claim? No
objection has been discovered. You may be
told that the Governor will not sisn. etc..
] which is slander on his Excellency. No one
knows what the Governor will do; but It Is
j safe to presume that he will prefer a bill
' which saves 557,6t5 to the State, saves cost to
the litigants, bars out bogus and fictitious
; claims and methodically winds the whole thing
j up in one Interpleader suit.
The fact that the amount appropriated is
. materially less than the aggregate of Clerk's
i certificates will cause every one to strive to
prevent and expose fraudulent claims in the
j interpleader suit which affords that opportu
nity. . This Is the secret of the opposition to the
i Kelsey amendment.
i Our association, of course, contains but a
| small percentage of all the claimants, but we
i represent all who still hold their claims and
: keep all posted. They know, and shall con
i tinue to know, what is being done. They prefer
no bill at all to one which robs the taxpayers
and paves the way for a struggle at the doors
of the treasury, in which Knaves would come
oft the victors. Respectfully.

GOVERNOR GAGE
IS FACETIOUS
OVER ANIMALS
A Jocular Message Vetoing the
Humane Society
Bill.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March 9.â the following mes
sage from the Governor which was re
ceived by the Assembly this evening it
would appear that when it was written
his gubernatorial highness was in a par
ticularly jocular mood, so much so that
he apparently did not realize the Import
ance of the measure which he so ruthless
ly hit, with an ax.
The bill was an act for the protection
of dumb beasts, and provided for the
killing of the same when they had become
useless through abuse, sickness or in
other ways. It. provided for the appoint
ment of officers to enforce a law to compel
the owners of such animals to kill them,
and made it punishable by a tine or im
prisonment when the law was not 1 com
piled with. The bill virtually enforced
the law under which the humane socie
ties of the different cities are acting.
The following is the Governor's message:
BURNS' MANAGERS
TRY TO RECOVER
FROM BLUNDERS
Legislators Astonished by the Sudden Change
of Heart in the Green Case.
HIS HENCHMEN BEG FOR FAVORS
The Tide Now Sets Strongly Toward General Barnes and It
Looks as if He Would Get the Required
Number of Votes.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO. March o.â The managers of
Dan Burns' campaign for the Senator
ship have put in their time to-day in
a vain effort to retrieve the loss of
prestige caused by the blunders of yes
terday. V V-V
All the declarations so solemnly made
by them yesterday that the dismissal
of the proceedings against Milton J.
Green would cast a stain on the honor
of the Legislature were taken back,
and the Burns following voted not only
to set Green free but to discharge the
investigating committee from further
service. Members of the Legislature
were astounded. A rumor was started
that an alliance.of the Burns and Grant
forces had been effected, but inquiry at
Grant's headquarters brought forth
prompt and sweeping denial of the re
port.
To-night the Grant men are as firm
as ever in their purpose to resist every
open or secret effort to secure the elec
tion of Burns. The Grant column will
stand unbroken as long as danger of
Burns' election exists.
Burns' fight for the Senatorship is
utterly lost unless the railroad comes
to his rescue with boodle and plenty
of it. The instant the boodle is em
ployed to capture an outsider some
shrewd "medicine" man will convey a
hint o-f the transaction, and a demand
for enough to go around will at once
be made and pressed. The best judges
of the political situation have reached
the conclusion that money in small
sums cannot be used effectively in this
Senatorial struggle. The conflicting
forces are so firmly set and resolutely
pledged that money, except it be used
in very large sums, cannot change the
alignment.
The opinion is by no means universal
that Burns' fight is utterly lost, but
many judges entertain the view that his
camp is on the verge of demoralization.
Others suspect a wary and adroit
scheme to lure the Barnes and Grant
men into a caucus by a feigning of
weakness. For that reason no chances
will be taken. No propositions for a
caucus .will be entertained. Having
fought the fight so far in the open,
where the people of the State could
daily see how their representatives
voted, there is an increasing sentiment
in favor of fighting it out on that line.
Burns may resolve to adjourn the j_eg
islature without an election, but he may
fail to carry out his resolution.
The events of the past twenty-four
hours have demonstrated beyond a
doubt that Burns cannot control the
Legislature. Early in the session his
followers assumed an air of defiance.
"Executive Department, State of Cali
fornia.
"I herewith return to your honorable
body without my approval Assembly bill
Number 5. with my objections thereto:
"This bill exhibits the evils of overzeal.
Apparently designed to relieve the bur
dens laid upon all dumb animals, It act
ually Imposes the ponderous financial bur
den of $102,600 annually not only on the
mule, but human taxpayers of the State
or a tax upon the people of each county of

benefit of the sympathetic friends of the
brute. For the violation of any one of the
extraordinary provisions of this bill the
offense is rated so high that all members
and agents of the society referred to in
the act are authorized to start upon a pil
grimage of humane slaughter, and for
such purposes may carry the same weap

"These newly created knights of the
nHtol and truncheon are justified by this
bill in the use of armed intervention not
for the benefit of the State but for the
purpose of increasing the exchequer of the
incorporated humane societies. .
"The societies characterized as hu
mane.' which should operate under this
bill would soon prove a misnomer, Inas
much as by its provisions the officers of
such societies are authorized to kill every
sick disabled, Infirm or crippled animal
which may have been abandoned by its
owner, and are empowered to use force
and arms against any person who should
remonstrate or interfere with this san
""nother unusually cruel feature of the
" \nother unusually cruel feature of the.
bill is to be found In section 21, by which
it is made the duty of every owner of an
animal- 'which Is unfit by reason of its
physical condition for the purpose for
which such animals are usually employed,
and when there is no reasonable proba
bility of such animal ever becoming fit
for "the purposes for which it Is usually
employee:,' to kill the same within twelve
hours after being notified by a peace of
ficer or officer of said society. So, there
fore, if -the animal should have been used
for ' racing or breeding purposes and
should be no longer fit therefor, the un
fortunate beast must be deprived of life.
This doctrine Is wholly Indefensible. If :
the owner of a horse destined for such
fate, because of such uselessness. should
happen to be a hippophile and lack the
bloodthirsty spirit necessary for obedi
ence to such officer's command, then he
is deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and
subjected to the punishment of fine or
imprisonment or both, as provided for in
the act.
"I find a singular ambiguity in section
21 of the bill which, should it become a
law, might puzzle the ermined arbiters,
namely where the following language is
used: 'Any person or persons holding a
lien or liens against any animal or ani- i
mals under the provisions of this act may
satisfy such Hen as follows: If such lien
be not paid by the party or parties re
sponsible within three days after the ob
ligation becomes due, then the party or
parties holding such Hen may resort to
the 'proper court to satisfy the claim or
he or they three days after the charges
against such property become due may
sell the same or so much thereof as may
be necessary to defray the amount due
and cost of sale.' etc.
"Now. as by section 20 no tail shall be
'docked' or shortened it might be diffi
cult for a strict constructionist to deter
mine whether the tail should be included
or excluded from the sale and a conflict
might arise which would involve mathe
matics a3 well as ethlcS. But disregard
ing this possible conflict as of trivial im
portance it is not useless to the tax- !
Eaver to scrutinize the purpose -of the !

i Now they plead and petition for legis
i lative favors.
There are many people here who fig
ure that General Barnes may get a suf
ficient number of votes to capture the
Senatorial prize. The number of letters
and telegrams coming from every sec
tion of the State urging members to
vote for Barnes is surprising. Refer
ence is frequently made in the letters
to the gallant fight which Barnes made
for Henry T. Gage and the whole Re
publican ticket. When the so-called
"leaders" were smoking cigars with
Mose Gunst in cozy clubrooms of San
Francisco General Barnes was at the
front bearing the burden of assault
from every Democratic newspaper and
orator in the State.
In order to impress the gudgeons with
an idea of Colonel Burns' prestige it
was planned early in the Senatorial
campaign that the colonel himself or
some tout in chief should daily be seen
at Governor Gage's elbow. The spec
tacle was designed, to impress the com
mon herd with the notion that the State
patronage was being held out for the
exclusive use of the Burns followers.
A little change in the programme has
now. been devised. The new wrinkle is
to have a chief among the touts in close
conversation with leading men of the
Grant forces. Colonel Burns and Her
vey Lindley have been very sweet on
Grant and his managers to-day. The
impression is to be conveyed that the
colonel and the San Diego statesman
are to join hands and elect a United
States Senator. The Grant men have
caught on to the curves of Lindley.
The political managers in Dan's serv
ice are not very bright. They were
dull enough to believe that the defeat
of the Harbor Commission reorganiza
tion in the. Senate yesterday was de
signed as punishment of the Burns
men for voting against the .resolution
to dismiss the Green case. The fact i?
that the Grant people some weeks ago
suspected that the scheme to reorganize
the board was devised to make places
to be promised to men who would line
up for Burns and accordingly they
voted against it.
It is given out to-night that to-mor
row's Senatorial ballot will show sev
eral changes in favor of General
Barnes. The accessions to his ranks
will, if what is said be true, come
from the fold of Irving M. Scott. Sena

DICKINSON FIGHTS HARD
FOR HARBOR COMMISSION
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March Dickinson's bill to re
organize the Harbor Commission of San
Francisco came up before the Senate this
evening on Dickinson's motion to recon
sider the vote that had been so disastrous
to it last night. He made his motion to
reconsider and then when it had been put
he moved to postpone the consideration
of it until half-past 3 Saturday afternoon.
He did so, he said, because he wished to
have a full attendance when the measure
came up again. .-.
Davis objected to the postponement. He
said they could take the matter up at
once and, as for attendance, it was bet
ter right then than it would be on Sat
urday afternoon, when experience had
shown the attendance was always poor.
Dickinson insisted that he had a right to
expect that the Senate would do him that
courtesy and he amended his motion in
compliance with Davis' objection so that
a motion to reconsider should come up
to-morrow. Davis withdrew his objec
tions for reasons of Senatorial courtesy
and Boyce demanded that an hour should
be set for Its consideration to-morrow.
Again Dickinson quoted Senatorial cour
tesy and finally his motion to reconsider
took the. course he wished it to take. It
was postponed till to-morrow, when it
will come up for action. It will hardly
fare any better than it did last evening,
however, for the Democrats will all sup
port it again and every Republican ex
cept one who voted against It last night,
says he will do so again to-morrow. -.y y

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRAMENTO, March 9.â order to as
certain th- exact truth concerning the multitude of rumors and conjec
ture growing out of D. M. Burns' interviews to-day with I*. S. Grant
and Walter Bacon* /reporter "of The Call to-night asked Mr. Bacon a
number of questions bearing on the subject. Mr. Bacon replied in sub
stanc
"It is true that Mr. Grant and James Brown went to San Francisco
yesterday. They went on the 7:30 a. m. train and Mr. Grant returned the
same day on the train leaving San Francisco at 4 p. m. Mr. Brown did
not return until 11:30 to-day. The visit had no bearing on the Senatorial
situation.
"It is true also that Colonel Burns and Mr. Grant held a brief Inter
view to-day. Colonel Burns called un Mr. Giant and a few words were
exchanged regarding the resolution to dismiss the proceedings against
Milton J. Green. No other subject was discussed and there was not the
slightest reference to any other matter. The discussion did not last two
minutes.
"It is true that 1 met Colonel Burns at the suggestion of Hervey l.ind
ley at room 40 of the Capitol in th< presence of Mr. Crowder. This in
terview related wholly to the subject considered in the interview be
tween Colonel Burns and Mr. Grant. No other subject than the Milton
Green resolution was talked of. The suggestion to dismiss emanated
from Colonel Burns.
"It is not true," said Mr. Bacon, "that the Grant people have ever
thought of an alliance or combination with the Burns camp. There
never lias been and never will be any negotiations in that direction. It
the break in the Burns camp ever comes, Mr. Grant may receive a few
votes from that source. The conjecture of a deal on the part of Mr.

ANOTHER ROUND
OF PRESS BAITING
IN THE SENATE
The Upper House Passes the
Bill to Compel Signatures
to Articles.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 9.â The Senate took to
press baiting again this evening and in
dulged in one of its periodic revels in
vituperation directed at all things jour-
Morehouse was floor manager and Davis
was his assistant, and between them thty
passed Morehouse's measure to compel
signatures to all personal articles.
By the bill every man who writes an *
article which "tends to blacken the mem
ory of one who is dead, or to impeach the
honesty, integrity, virtue or reputation I
or publish the- natural or alleged defects
of one who is alive, and thereby expose
him or her to public hatred, contempt or
ridicule" must sign his true name to it
and it shall he printed at the end of the
article. To insure an observance of this |
law there i.- provided a penalty of $1000 J
lor every Infraction of its terms.
Smith was the first to speak In defense
of the impersonal character which lias
made the newspaper such a power and
has given it so much more opportunity to
prosecute its work in fts own chosen
held. Smith is a newspaper man, and so
is Shortridge nd Rowell and Prisk. but
there are others in the Senate who are
not. and It was those who, not knowing
lhe work involved in publishing the news
on time, waxed eloquent over the possibil
ities of newspaper work and the restric
tions it can bear without losing its use
fulness ml value. Smith spoke of the im
practical aspect of the signature scheme,
and he was followed by Sims, who went
further into the rights and liberties of
the press. Smith thought the law, if en
act* could never be applied, and Sims
believed it would hamper an Institution
which should not be hampered. Sims de
clared there was law enough on the books
to tight every wrong the press ever did
or will do, and he thought it was a dan
gerous precedent to establish, this taking
away from the paper its general respon
sibility and making it a mere personal
one. He looked at the signature measure
only in conjunction with the one allowing
a free pot shot at all offending editors.
and he saw in it the good point of show-
Ing a man the person to draw a bead on
if he wished to exercise tne right of free
shooting, but he believed it was a bail law
and should not be considered seriously
by the Senate. Senator Simpson sup
ported the bill. He said no man had more
cause than he to favor such a measure,
and he believed it was a law that should
pass.
Shortridge had his word to say in de
fense of his own profession, and he used
all kinds of emphasis in the saying. He
too knew the law to be Impractical, and
from his own experience he illustrated
what he meant. He tried to explain tin
process of gathering news and to show
that there were some things about it that
when left to fallible human judgment
might not go in practice as. they do in
theory; but the Senate had brought the
bill up to pass it, and. it did not need the
verbal vitriol which Morehouse poured
over the newspaper tables to insure a big
vote. Davis' speech on the subject was
what did most for the bill, for he declared
himself in favor of the liberty of the
press and then proceeded to adroitly re
strict it. He believed it should be placed
under certain limitsâ the same limits the
previous speakers had opposedâ not Le
cause the restrictions were bad in them
selves but because they opened the door
to others. One of the limits he favored
was the Morehouse measure.
The bill then went to a vote and it was
passed by the following:
kvesâ Ashe, Bettman. Boyce. Bulla,
Burnett, chapman. Curtin. Cutter, Davis,
Dwyer, Flint, Gillette, Hall, noey, Leav

before the result was announced and then
gave notice that he would move for a re
consideration to-morrow.

gate the charge of contempt against
George W. Ficks, manager of the Clunie

of the acts during which time a number
of deputy sergeants ut arms were at

Assemblymen Glenn and Sanford were
called and testified that they had been
present In the theater at the time, but
had not advised Ficks to obstruct the
service of process. yy- .
Kicks' defense was that he did not turn
out the lights, but that they were turned
out by McKee Rankin, He acknowledged
he refused to turn them up when asked
to do so and that he said he would shoot
any man who attempted to turn them
up! He claimed that he did. not want any
one but an electrician to handle the
lights, as it might burn out the fuses and
create an explosion, which would be fol
lowed by a panic. He denied the right
of the deputy sergeants at arms to order
him to turn up the lights.

George H. Holden. a representative of

King of Washington. D. C, has returned
from Manila, and is a guest at the Occi

Philippines," said Mr. Holden. "was to
take up the claims of Dewey's marines
for 'head money,' which will be adjudicat

The law provides for the payment of
an amount equal to $100 for each man in

draws, provided the enemy was an in

equal or superior, then the sum of $2'Â»J

During the Civil War the money was
looked upon as a direct gift by the Gov

Advocate has decided that they should be
adjudicated by the court, and this deci
sion will delay the payment of th.- claims
The prize money claims which will be

"My work in Manila had the approval
of Admiral Dewey, who gave me permis
sion to visit the ships, besides a personal
letter to the captains. He appeared to be
much pleased with my mission, and gave
me much encouragement. When I visited

came to their rooms, 523 Post street,
punched her on the chin and "put her to

A New Plan Evolved to Save the

Southern Portion of '

The continued dry spell in the south
ern parts of the State has brought stock
i men face to face with the necessity of
i an immediate move if they would save the
| lives of their herds. The grazing lands
: are grassless and as the Government has
j refused to permit the cattle being allowed
! to feed on the reservations they must be
! removed from that section or die of star
j vation, and arrangements are now under
j way to send the famishing animals tp the
j more favored northern sections of the
1 State, where feed is plenty.
At a meeting of the Wool Growers' As
j sociation, held in this city March 4. and
j presided over by Chairman < '. H. Abbott,
â  a committee was sent to Sacramento for
\ the purpose of obtaining relief for the
herds of stock famishing in the parched
hills of the State. The Legislature passed
! a resolution requesting the Governor to
ask that the national parks be opened
for grazing purposes until the needed ,
rains came. ; .

the result of numerous inquiries which <
' have come from the cattle raisers in the ;
southern part of California, whose stock ;

section. Unless rain falls within the next
two weeks the railroad company will
move large herds into Trinity County,
which has had an abundance of rain and
consequently has good pasturage. Espe
cially are the cattle suffering in Kern

WED MISS GREGORY
OAKLAND. March The engage
ment of Senator F.S. Straiten of
this city to Miss Grace Gregory of
New York was announced to-night.
Miss Gregory formerly lived in this city
and Is a very popular and charming
lady. Senator Stratton has won fame
as a lawyer and enjoys a lucrative
practice. He has wealth, and is es
teemed by all who know him. He is
a member of the Senate, and as such
has gained prominence by his earnest
advocacy of Important measures. Miss
Gregory is now a resident of New
York. She met Mr. Stratton in local
society, and a mutual liking sprung
up between them. Although she took
up her residence in the East their cor
respondence has been continuous. No
date bos been announced for the wed
ding, hut it is said it will take place
booh after the adjournment of tb*
Legislature,
required to be stamped. The owners of
cheap restaurants discarded the use of
bottles for the red wine of the variety
known as "dago red," and served it- in
pitchers and glasses. Special Internal
Revenue Agent Burt Thomas wrote to the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue for
light on the matter. A letter in reply
has been received stating that "ordinary
china pitchers such as are used for cream
or water pitchers do not. in the opinion of
this office, come within the description of
vessels of such size and material as show
them to be used for bottles or substitutes
for bottles for the purpose of evading the
tax."

FLAMES ONCE CHECKED
BURST FORTH AGAIN
COSTLY EARLY MORNING BLAZE.
The Building* of the Pacific Power
Company Visited by
Fire.
â 
An alarm was turned in from box 37 at
8:30 o'clock last night for a fire on the
fourth floor of the building owned by the
Pacific Power Company at -1 to 27 Steven
son street. The blaze started in the
printing establishment of Brown & Bley
from spontaneous combustion of oily
waste. Brown & Bley and Myerstein &
Co., manufacturers of shirts, sustained
a loss aggregating $2000.
At 3 o'clock this morning the flames
broke out anew in the building, and a gen
eral alarm. was turned in to subdue the
fire which had gained such headway that
before the department arrived oh the
scene tin' entire upper floor had been
gutted.
For a time it looked as if the entlir
building would necessarily be consumed.
The flames shot through the roof and
ate their way down to the third floor
with great rapidity, but when Chief Sul
livan got the new wafer tower to work
it was seen that the building could be
saved. Fifteen minutes after the large
number of streams which were turned
on the flames had been playing the blaze
had been confined to the top story.
Brown & Bley, printers and photo en
gravers, are the greatest losers. Their six
presses are totally destroyed as are all of
their type, photo engraving "appliance;'
the stock of paper and finished orders
they had on hand. Meyerstein & Co 'he
shirt manufacturers, will also suffer a
total loss. The machinery of the Pacific
Power Company on thelower floor Is great
ly damaged by water, and it is doubtful if
they will be able to run for several days.
A number of small factories throughout
the city secure their power from the com
pany and wil probably be obliged to shut
down. â¢' " 'W ' VV
The total loss to the building and con
tents Is variously estimated at from $30.
--000 to $60,000, and this is only partially
covered by insurance.
A heavy brick fire wall is all that saved
the building of the Krogh Manufactur
ing Company, next door to the power
company. The Krogh building, it will
be remembered, was totally gutted by a
fire on New Tear's night. After that
blaze new fire escapes and stand pipes
were placed- .on the power company's
building, and the department used these
to good advantage.
At 3:30 this morning the Are was well
under control. Streams were being played
from all sides of the building, an the
flames had been confined to the top floor
where it originated.
HEAD IN A GARBAGE PILE.
A partly dissected head of a man was
found yesterday morning in a pile of gar
bage at the Sanitary 'Reduction Works.
It was discovered by one of the workmen
engaged in raking down the garbage for
the furnace. It is impossible to learn
what wagon brought the gruesome thing
to the works or from what section of the
city it came. However, there is no doubt
that it was thrown into the refuse barrel
by some medical student. The skull had
been divided with a saw and the brain
removed, while other parts of the head
showed the marks of the dissecting knife.
Moreover, the color of the flesh showed
conclusively that it had been Immersed
In some preserving fluid. BÂ£_i__
The senseless habit of throwing por
tions of human bodies hacked to pieces In
dissecting rooms into garbage barrels is
getting quite prevalent among a class of
smart medical students who consider it
professional- to be unfeeling and unnat
ural amid surroundings that horrify or
dinary persons. Superintendent Boucher
of the Reduction Works states that very
often his workmen find in the garbage
heap portions of the human frame cut
and sawn undoubtedly, by medical peo
ple. A closer investigation of the refuse
from the medical colleges by the health
or police authorities might put a stop to
the practice.

JONES OF ARKANSAS
IN DANGEROUS STATE
WASHINGTON, March 9.â Senator Jones of Arkansas, chairman of
the National Democratic Committee, is in a precarious condition
owing to his liability to another dangerous attack of hearffrou
ble at any time. As is usually the case in the intervals between
attacks of this nature, he is getting along very well just now,
and to-day was in comparatively fair condition after a good night's rest,
but is maintaining the utmost caution and under strict orders of his phy
sician, and avoiding any exertion. This is a radical change for a man of
Senator Jones' active habits and he naturally chafes under it. His mal
ady, angina pectoris, is at best a grave one and the outcome never can
be foreseen. So far, however, there have been no untoward complica
tions in Senator Jones' case and there is a strong hope that with abso
lute quiet and rest away from his work for a considerable period he may
recover.

| has not yet been made public, the fact
j that she is a multi-millionaire and that
j she has a residence in California.
"I have for a long time been inter
ested in Wellesley," she said when seen
at her magnificent mansion at Peace
dale, R. 1., to-day. "Through the in
! fluence of Horace Scudder I was asked i
to become a member of the board of
visitors for the departments of history
and economics. For five years I was
a visitor. When Mrs. Palmer was
president she wanted me to take an
j English chair, but I did not find it
possible.
"I am much in favor of outdoor life.
i College girls must have daily exercise.
I heartily approve of all outdoor sports. ,
i I realize, however, that they can be
' carried to excess, and should always
guard carefully any tendency in that
direction.
"I shall not teach at all. It would
I not be possible to find time."
Miss Hazzard spends most of her
time outdoors, wearing invariably the
short skirt. She is a musician and ar
: tist and a poet, and has a library of
j 6000 volumes. Her residence is practic
ally a public hall of music, art and
'< education.
For generations the Hazzards have
! been very wealthy. In a great measure
the town owes its prosperity and high
1 intellectual rank to the Hazzards, who
, have put them in touch with the best.
'â  The social and intellectual life of the

building which is library and music

From the townspeople I learned how
Miss Hazzard has endeared herself to
everybody, rich or poor, old or young.
; They never tire of singing her praises.
! No- one in town is long sick unless Miss
Hazzard knows it; no one is in trouble
I and she not ready to sympathize and
help She is not only one of the trus

In this building are the King

STRUCK THE LANDLORD.
Why Pugilist Solly Smith Appeared
in the Police Court.
NEW YORK. March 9.â Solly Smith, the
pugilist, who lives with his wife in Bar
bours Hotel, Westchester, was arraigned
in th. Police Court this morning, charged
with disorder!', conduct. John Barbour,
proprietor of the hotel, was the complain
ant. According to the story told In court
Smith who had dined out last evening,
arrived at the hotel somewhat the worse
for liquor. Soon after reaching his room
he began quarreling with his wife. Bar
bour made his way to the pugilist's room
and peered in at the door. He was greeted
with* a right-hand jab in the stomach.
The blow doubled him up, and the pugil
ist straightened him out again with a
wicked uppercut on the chin. Barbour
quickly summoned a policeman and had
Smith arrested. Barbour refused to press
his complaint against Smith, saying he
was a very good fellow when sober. The
magistrate thereupon discharged him.
CARLTON RICKARDS IS
DISMISSED FflOM OFFFICE
CHINESE 7NTERPRETER NEG
LECTS HIS DUTIES.
The Call's Exposures Result in a
Falling Off in the Flood of
Coolie Ita migration.
The Secretary of the Treasury, has de
clared vacant the position* of interpreter
in the Chinese Bureau, now .held by
Carlton Riekards. and a letter from the
Secretary containing that announcement
arrived at the bureau yesterday. - The
reason given for the dismissal of Mr.
Riekards is that he does not devote his
whole time to the duties of the position,
and that he has been late in reporting at
the bureau office on the days on which
his services have been required. It is not â¢
expected that a successor will be ap
pointed, as the department considers Dr.
Gardiner able to take care of all the In
terpreting required.
Previous to the administration of B.
E. Meredith the office was managed with
one Interpreter and fewer deputies. But
during the past two years, for reasons
that may lie obvious, the arrivals of Chi
nese have increased from an average of
1700 per annum to more than 3000. The in
creased Influx was so pronounced that It
was found necessary to employ additional
Inspectors and Fnterpreters. Since The |
Call a few months ago exposed the open- j
door policy under which the bureau was
managed the lines were drawn closer and
there was a falling off in the flood of Im
migration, notably in the number of fe- j
male slaves. ' .--,'â¢.:-'_
It is argued that with the proper safe- j
guards under an honest and abb adminis- j
tration of the bureau the arrivals will be j
reduced to less than 2000 and that a much
smaller force than that at present em- i
ployed will be able to handle all the busi- |
ness, as In days of yore.

BALLOTS BOLDLY
TAMPERED WITH
Gross Frauds Right in
Open Court.
HERRINGTON IS GRILLED
JUDGE HYLAND SCORES THE
DARING SCHEMERS.
Tactics of a' San Jose Contestant That
Will Cause Him to Lose, and
Provide Work for the
Grand Jury.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, March There were
some more sensational statements of
the discovery of fraud in the Herring
ton-Campbell contest this morning.
Judge Hyland did not mince things, but
told those interested in the matter that
he had found the grossest frauds, and
to make matters worse these had been
practiced right under his nose in open
court. The courtroom was jammed and
the spectators enjoyed the â¢â¢grilling''
Herrington's attorneys came in for.
Judge Hyland stated the contest was
now reopened for the purpose of either
side offering testimony as to the pecu
liar crosses and thumbmarks found on
the ballots which had evidently been
tampered with.
H. C. Moore, Herrington's attorney,
said he had no evidence to offer.
The Judge then gave a long explana
tion of the crookedness he had dis
covered. It was stated that Campbell
had by evidence impeached the validity
of six ballots from Vineland Precinct.
On these a peculiar cross had been used
and always in the interest of Herring
ton. These ballots had been tampered
with in the Interim between the count
of the ballots in the Conant-Lotz con
test and the present one. Campbell had
introduced testin.ony to prove these
marks were not on ballots in the con
test and the contestant h -d made no
attempt to refute it. Further there had .
been eleven blank ballots in Vineland
during the first contest, but during this
recount the number had changed to
nine blank ballots, and the missing two
had evidently been changed to Herring
ton votes. Judge Hyland stated he had
gone over a majority of the ballots of
the county and had found many ballots
that showed unmistakable signs of
fraud. In San Jose Precinct No. 7 there
were six of the ballots. The cross used
in. each instance was different from that
on the ballot and easily found. In
Precinct No. 5 there were four, in Pre
cinct No. 6 one. in Precinct No. 4 one.
These were counted prior to February
6 and on all the same cross was used.
After this date a different cross was
used and the user had left his thumb
marks around It in evidence. Of these
marks San Jose Precinct No. 11 showed
two ballots. Precinct No. 18 three, Pre
cinct No. 20 five and University Pre
cinct one. In all some twenty-nine of
these ballots had been changed. This,
the court stated, was the result of his
research. He again inquired if either
side had any evidence to present in the
matter.
Moore answered in the negative.
Campbell rose to a point of explanation.
He said he had no excuse to offer as he
had directed the court's attention to
the matter. They had proved by testi
mony the ballots had been tampered
with. The fraud had been against them.
The marking of the ballots had been a
piece of villainy of which they were the
intended victims, but the plans had
been thwarted and the fraud detected.
Judge Hyland then ordered the case
submitted for final determination.
Gang politicians are not pleased with
the outcome of the contest for they now
realize Campbell will be given the de
cision. Furthermore the Grand Jury
now in session may take the matter up
and bring in some indictments.
It is thought that the same tactics
employed to count Herrington in were
used in the Conant-Lotz contest. Lot*
was given the certificate of election
over Conant by two votes. This was
after the Supervisors had reconsidered
their action whereby they gave the
election to Conant on a similar vote
and had cut down his majority of four
teen Instead of gaining in the contest
he lost from the start and Lotz's lead
of two was increased over a hundred. â¢
Conant's friends now claim he was
counted out.

LONDON. March 9.â ln introducing
the naval estimates in tl^e House of j
Commons to-day the First Lord of the !
Admiralty, the .Right Hon. George J. |
Goschen. said that never had estimates
been submitted under more unique cir
cumstances. Ahead was the conference
for international disarmament while
behind were the incidents of last No
vember, and while a comparison of the
naval strength of the various countries
was in every mouth, the most striking
confidence was shown in British pre
paredness to meet all emergencies.
The continental powers, he further
said, were disturbed by the allegation
that Great Britain was preparing with
a particular purpose for aggressive ac
tion, but, the Minister asserted, the
idea never entered the mind of the
Government. He then proceeded to de
tail the naval programme.
Mr. Goschen said her Majesty's Gov
ernment proposed to make Wei-Hai
"Wei, the war port on the northern coast
of the Shan Tun peninsula, a secondary
naval base, pointing out that it would
be a most valuable anchorage and of
the greatest importance In any opera
tions in Chinese waters and adding that
it was proposed to expend Â£1,300,000 on
"\Vei-Hai-Wei during the present year
and Â£1,500,000 next year.
Continuing, Mr. Goschen informed the
House that the personnel of the navy
for the coming year would be increased
by 4250 men. making a total of 110,640,
at a cost of Â£4,474,000.
Comparing the pay of the personnel
Mr. Goschen said that while Great Brit
ain paid Â£7,000,000 and France Â£3,000,
--100, Russia paid only Â£445,000. He could
not understand how that was, but that
was all the estimates revealed.
Referring to ship-building he said the
coming programme had been framed
after consideration of the programmes :
of the other powers. These, he pointed
out were not reassuring. The United
States Russia, France. Japan, Italy
and Germany had under construction
685.000 tons of warships, or 225,000 tons
more than was contemplated in the
present estimates.
This had forced the Government to

â¢ Special Dispatch- to The Call.
THE HAGUE, March 9.â The Peace
Conference, otherwise the conference of
representatives of the powers, called by
the Czar to discuss the possibility of
taking steps toward a general disarma
ment, will meet here on May 18.
NEW YORK, March 9.â A London
special cable to the Journal says:
Prince Krapotkin, scientist and exiled
leader of Russian nihilists, has taken
advantage of the present critical rela
tions between Russia and England to
issue an appeal to the English-speaking
world against accepting the Czars
peace manifesto. He declares it is not
considered sincere even by the Rus
sians.
Prince Krapotkin's address con
tinues: "Since Pobiedonotseff issued
this proclamation in the name of the
Czar he has tried to flog and torture
13,000 Doukhobors into military ser
vice, and meanwhile the Czar has been
violating the constitution of Finland
in order to impose compulsory military
service upon the people. It is too re-,
volting to be witnessed with patience.
â¢â¢Sensational journalists are leading
the public astray anent the venom
concealed in the manifesto. Through
out Russia the press is strictly forbid
den to discuss the armament question.
The pulpit also is under rigorous cen
sorship to prevent the priests speaking
against war."
LONDON. March 10.â The Daily
Graphic says this morning it under
stands that Sir Julian Pauncefote,
British Embassador at Washington,
has been appointed to represent Great
Britain at the forthcoming conference
for the limitation of armaments.
MATTHEW GILLIGAN
IN LEGAL TROUBLE
The Fair Will Case "Hack Man" Al
leged to Have Defrauded His
Creditors.
SAN RAFAEL. March â¢ 9.â Leon A. Lan- .
c^l. as assignee of the estate of Matthew
Gililgan. an insolvent debtor, has brought
suit in the Superior Court through At- |
torney J. W. Cochrane against Gilligan,
his daughter Louise, et al., for the recov
ery of certain property alleged to be pur
chased with money fraudulently secured
Gilligan is the man whose "hack iigured ,
so prominently in the Fair will case, and
is one of the most prominent merchants in
this city. . ,-_.â.
It is alleged in the complaint that on
April 29. 189 S. Gilligan tiled a petition in j
insolvency for the sum of $300. and was ,
declared to be an Insolvent debtor. In j
May of the same year the creditors met \
and assigned their claims to Lancet. It !
Is further alleged that on February 13,
1698, in contemplation of insolvency pro
ceedings, Gilligan deeded his property to
his daughter Louise, with the intention
of defrauding his creditors; that after- :
ward the Hibernia Bank foreclosed on
Gilligan's Fourth street property, which
was resigned to them after the bank had
paid the daughter Louise the sum of j
$3000. With this money Gilligan is said
to have purchased the goods necessary to |
stock his boot and shoe store. I
Lancel prays the court to declare thai
said personal property of Gilligan the
property of his creditors, as he has not :
yjÂ»t been discharged from insolvency pro- |
ceedings. Judge Angellottl made an order |
for Giiiigan to appear in court on the 13th i
inst. and show cause why such should not
be done. â¢
Crushed by Falling Rock. j
MADRID, March 9.- vast quantity of
rock overhanging the village' of Rucuerja. ,
near A'baceto, In the province of that
name, fell to-day. destroying many
houses and killing eleven people. 1
draw up a new programme. Excluding
last year's supplemental programme, it
provided for two ironclads, two ar
mored cruisers and three smaller cruis
ers of a specially high speed. -.
The money required,, therefore, for
the coming financial year was Â£550,000
and the total under the shipbuilding
vote, including the liabilities for last
year's original and supplementary pro
grammes would be Â£12,817,000. an in
crease of over Â£2,000,000. The total
estimates were Â£26,594,000.
. For armament Mr. Goschen asked
an increase. of Â£161,000, chiefly for the
construction of guns, but also for more
ammunition for practice, which, he as
serted, was a matter of enormous im
portance, as shown by the late war.
After speaking of the necessity for
an increased shipbuilding vote, he said
these "were the votes required by the
present situation. t
"But," he added, "would that the ac
tion of other nations, recognizing that
the coming international conference,
could make it possible for us to dimin
ish or modify the programme, while,
'of course, maintaining our standard
and relative position."
Mr. Goschen then announced, in be
half of her Majesty's Government,
that if the other great naval powers
were prepared to diminish their pro
grammes. . Great Britain was prepared
to modify hers. But If the Czar's de
sires were not realized, the programme
would have to stand, and .he (Mr.
Goschen) expressed the hope that those
who were proposing to attack the
country's expenditure Would not at
tempt to dissuade the people from
bearing the taxation necessary to
carry on the duties of the empire.
In conclusion the First Lord of the
Admiralty said the estimates were
â¢'simply the embodiment of the feel
ings of a peace-loving, determined na
tion."
Mr. Goschen emphasized the purely '
defensive objects of the naval increase, j
but said that in view of the construe- j
tion by her rivals of fast cruisers, with
the avowed purpose of preying upon j
British commerce and Great Britain's :
food supply in the event of war. Eng- j
land was forced to build five new ;
cruisers, particularly swift, in order to ;
circumvent these schemes. He also
said that the four armored cruisers j
now being built under the original pro
gramme would be the most powerful
ships in the world.
The Times, referring editorially to the j
statement of the First Lord of the Ad- ;
miralty in the House of Commons yes
terday, says: "It is betraying no state
secret to affirm that nothing but the !
strength of our navy saved us from (
having to choose between the loss of j
what our arms had on in the Soudan
and a war which would speedily have f
"st fifty times what we spent In avert- [
ing it." j
RAFFEL AMAZES
THE STATESMEN
Coolly Set Asidethe Ber-
lin Treaty.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, March 9.â The State
Department has been informed that Dr.
Solf has sailed from Germany for New
York en route to tSamoa. â¢ He has been
named by the German Government to
replace Dr. Raffel, the late president of
the Municipal Council at Apia, who has
just arrived at San Francisco on his
way back to Berlin. It is probable that
he will cross Dr. Solf somewhere in this
country and inform him as to the situa
tion in the Samoan Islands when he
left.
The rather naive explanation given
by Dr. Raffel at San Francisco yester
day of the conditions under which he
came to" interfere with the Chief Justice
at Apia* were received here with some
amazement, the officials pointing out
that the doctor clearly saw no impro
priety in the setting aside of the solemn
obligation of the Berlin treaty by the
little Municipal Council of Samoa.
It is a fact that had Chief Justice
Chambers not been guilty of the im
prudence of commenting so freely, upon
the German Government and allowing
those comments to be published in. the
letter to his brother in this country, he
would have the fullest, support of the
State Department. But while the ex
amination so far made of the reports
from all sources of the events that took
place at Apia in connection with the
kingly succession case go to show that
the Chief Justice acted within his
rights, it is argued that his replacement
by another American would go a long
way toward effecting a peaceable ad
justment of the conditions in Samoa.

The Peking correspondent of the Times
says: "The Tsung Li Yamen has notified

â¢'. don Bennett.
MANILA, March 9.â General Rlos,
commander of the Spanish forces, has
resigned, owing to the fact that the
Government at Madrid consulted with
the Archbishop of Manila as to the
best means of liberating the Spanish
prisoners. On receiving satisfaction he
resumed his office.
Spain now requires him to occupy the
Caroline, Marianne and Pelew Islands
before handing them over to Germany,
which is apparently tneir purchaser.
The steamships Saturnus and Gloria,
which left Manila under the American
flag on February 1, returned to-day.
They report that on their " arrival at
Currimeo, province of llocos, the native
crews deserted. After a few days they
returned armed, seized the stores and
cargoes on the vessels and then aban
doned the steamships.
The Spaniards on both steamships
united, got up steam on the Saturnus
and towed the Gloria to Manila.
The steamship San Joaquin reports
that on her arrival at the same prov
ince the native crew murdered the
Spanish captain and engineer and even
the Chinese passengers.
TO ESTABLISH BANKS
IN THE ISLANDS
NEW YORK, March 9.â Negotiations
have been pending for some weeks oast
which have culminated in definite ac
tion toward the organization of - cor
poration to transact a general banking
business at Manila. J. & W. Seligman
& Co. of this city are at the head of
the enterprise and the new bank will
be ready for business in a short time.
The Manila corporation will be prob
ably known as the Anglo-American
Bank: The plan, it is understood, has
the approval of the administration.
It is also reported that the Anglo-
Californian Bank of San Francisco, in
conjunction with bankers in this city.
San Francisco and London, has ar
ranged to start a 'bank' in Honolulu.
As the United States banking law can
not yet be applied to banks in Hawaii
the bill to that effect having failed in
passage at the last session of Congress,
it is. probable that the. bank will be
organized under, the Hawaiian laws."
which are understood to be liberal, al
though not permitting the issue of
bank notes. Under the laws of the
island, the Government absolutely con
trols the issue of all notes.
ANDERSON WILL
SUCCEED MILLER
WASHINGTON, March 9.â A change
in command of the United States forces
at Iloilo will occur on March 27, re
sulting in the retirement of General
Marcus Miller, who on that date
reaches the age limit of sixty-four
years. General Miller is in the regu
lar service, having been promoted only
recently to the rank of brigadier gen
eral. If he were in the volunteer ser
vice his retirement would not be com
pulsory, a precedent to the contrary
having been established in the case of
several general officers who held com

REBEL INCENDIARIES
LAND AT PANDACAN
MANILA, March 10 (11:25 a. m.).â
Rebel incendiaries landed at the vil

purpose, it is alleged, of terrorizing
those of the inhabitants who do not
sympathize with the insurrection. A
number of native houses were de
stroyed.
With. the exception of San Pedro Ma

matters are unusually quiet along the

PRETTY FARCE OF
INSPECTING THE
PACKING HOUSES
Chicago Contractors Had Ample
Time to Prepare the Play and
It Works Smoothly.
CHICAGO, March 9.â The Court of
Inquiry to examine the beef question
to-day began its work in this city,
where are located the plants of the
packers who held the contracts for
supplying the army with animal food.
Two of the members, Brigadier General
George W. Davis and Lieutenant Col
onel George R. Davis, the judge advo
cate and recorder, reached here
Wednesday night and the other two
members, Major General James F.
Wade and Brigadier General George L.
Gillespie, arrived this morning.
A short executive session was held
at the army headquarters in the Pull
man building, and it resulted in a de
cision to defer the taking of testimony
until after an inspection had been made
of the packing houses at the stock
yards, 'where the refrigerated beef and
canned beef are prepared. The court
began In the killing room. The next
place visited was the cooling room.
Here were found several halves of beef
which had been condemned, either be
cause the beef was badly bruised or
gave evidence that the animal had had
tuberculosis. This condemned beef had
been placed by itself, and while the
court was present men came in to re
move it to the rendering tanks, prepara
tory to turning it into fertilizer. The
court examined these tanks carefully,
possibly in view of the statement that
the carcasses passed through them.
There certainly was no evidence of such
passage. ! From this room the court was
taken to the one in which the meat is
prepared for canning and saw the men
at work cutting up the meat. The next
THRILLING STORY
OF PERE FLEURY
Held in Captivity by
Chinese Rebels.
Special Dispatch to The Tali.
TACOMA, Wash.. March 9.â Oriental
advices just received state: The Chung
King correspondent of the North China
Daily News sends the following thrill
ing story of Pere Fleury's captivity,
as related by himself:
"On the 17th of January Yu Mantze
found himself completely surrounded
by the Fantai's troops. His escape was
impossible, so he came to me and told
me to get away to the imperial troops
at once as the Fantai had promised
him and his followers their lives if they
delivered me up safely. I started away
immediately, Yu Mantze accompanying
me. We had not gone many li before
we were overtaken by about 200 of Yu's
men, who wished to kill me, and would
have done so but for the earnest exhor
tations of Yu. He explained how the
Fantai had promised them their lives
and liberty if they delivered me up,
how that if they killed me they would
be destroyed, and finally how the coun
try would be invaded by a foreign army
and they would be exterminated. Yu's
councils prevailed and the 200 would-be
murderers turned themselves into my
bodyguard and escorted me to the out
posts of the imperial troops.
"Yu's men, a month ago, numbered
8000, but he has only about 2000 now,
the Fantai having struck fear into their
hearts; 300 were killed in the big fight
a short while ago. I was treated kindly
during the whole of my captivity; any
man Yu heard reviling me he knocked
down. Yu was afraid to kill me. al
though I invited him to do so. He car
ried me around from city to city and
made me witness the murder of many
Christians. One old man who was 65
years of age was murdered before my
eyes'. Yu is backed up by local officials
and the gentry, the latter helping him
considerably with money, the former by
shutting their eyes."
Pere Fleury is only 29 years of age
and has been in China but three years,
seven months of which he' has spent in
captivity. ___________________
ENGINEERS AT HONOLULU
TO BE CALLED HOME
WASHINGTON, March 9.â Four com
; panics of the Second United States Vol-
u nteer Engineers, comprising those at
j Honolulu, are shortly to be called home.
I They have been on duty. there since the
! outbreak of the Spanish war. They have
| been | maintained at Honolulu 1 and the
j engineer troops will be relieved either
Iby four companies of the Twenty
j fourth. Infantry (colored) now in Utah,
jor by two or more batteries of the
Sixth Artillery. The batteries of the
j Sixth Artillery are now in Manila and
! the remainder of the regiment now dis
j tributed along the Atlantic Coast under
orders to proceed there. Although not
yet settled it is probable two .or more
of these batteries will be utilized for
military service in Hawaii. In .that
case they will be detached from the
expedition on Its way to the Philippines.
General Shafter, commanding the De
partment of California, has been . in
formed that the Sixth Artillery may be
utilized for this service and has been
instructed to recruit the regiment to its
maximum strength.
I room visited was the canning depart -
! ment. Here the cooked meat was
* brought in in huge caldrons, deposited
on a platform and put into cans by ma
chinery, the, cans removed and sealed,
only a pinhole being left open in the
top. Next the cans were put under an
iron tank where they were subjected
to a heat of 250 degreesâ the sterilizing
process. While the court was in this
room a number of cans of roast beef
which had an old appearance^ and
which it was said had been in Porto
Rico, were opened. The meat inside
was good and the members of the court
tasted it. Subsequently the court was
shown through the printing, packing
and other branches. Barring* the kill
ing room everything about the estab
lishment was very clean.
\fter leaving the yards the court
went to the Bureau of Animal Industry
âa branch of the Agricultural Depart
mentâand obtained some information
from W. S. Devoe, who is in charge.
They read the law governing the in
spection of animals and inquired as to
the details of the work of inspection.
Inspectors are stationed in the yards
proper, and they condemn any diseased
cattle they see. The inspectors at the
packing houses supplement their work
by examining the carcasses after
slaughter and throw out any bearing
evidence of pulmonary troubles.
To-morrow morning the court will go
to the stock yards and spend the entire
day there in going over three other
packing houses. It is not likely that
any testimony will be taken before
Saturday morning. It is quite likely
that the evidence taken will be con
fined to that of the foreman or work
men, who have personal, knowledge of
the preparation of refrigerated beef and
canned roast beef for consumption.
CAUGHT STEAMING
PRIVATE LETTERS
Arrest of Postmaster at
Wilkesbarre.
Special Dispatch to Th- Call.
WILKESBARRE, Pa., March 9.âEd
ward F. Bogart, Postmaster of Wilkes
barre, was arrested to-day, charged
with tampering with the United States
mails. About two months ago several
complaints were lodged with the postal
authorities at Washington that mail
was disappearing and when received
bore evidence of having been opened
by a steaming process. The postal au
thorities subsequently detailed two Se
cret Service men on the case under
orders of Inspector Gorman. Last
night after the mail of the Baltimore
and Washington express arrived and
had been distributed, Bogart 'entered
the office and was seen to take several
letters from the boxes and then go into
his private office and carefully draw
the curtain.
A few minutes later a detective who
was acting as clerk turned out an elec
tric light in the rear end of the office,
this being a signal to two other secret
service men .who were stationed out
side. The man on the inside carefully
admitted his associates, one of whom
was Hugh Gorman. The two men
went at once to Bogart's private office
and without the ceremony of knocking
entered and found the postmaster
seated at his desk, on which lay the let
ters addressed to prominent business
men in this city, and all of them
opened. The postmaster was surprised
and not a little excited for a few mo
ments, but soon recovered his com
posure. He was later escorted to. his
home by the secret service men, where
a warrant for his arrest was subse
quently served. He was taken before
United States Commissioner Hahn,
where he gave bail in $4000 for his ap
pearance later.
Mr. Bogart, besides being editor of
the Evening Leader of this city, is a
member of a large number of lodges
and for the. past ten or twelve years
has been an active member of the base
ball association, a brother of the late
Joseph K. Bogart, a gentleman who
was prominent in Democratic county
and State politics and at the time of
his death was Postmaster.
Postmaster Bogart would not be in
terviewed, but in his paper, the Even
ing Leader, to-night, appears the fol
lowing:
"There are always two sides to a
question and when there are three or
four fellows, and one or two in par
ticular, clamoring for a political of
fice and hungry for the emoluments
attached thereto, there are sure to be
schemes worked and plans formed to
entrap the incumbent, cause his re
moval and punish him otherwise, even
if nothing further than the annoyance
and chagrin that the accomplishment
of their devilish underhand work im
poses. When the diabolical schemers
are fully shown up and their nefarious
trickery exposed there is a question as
to which side will furnish the raciest
reading." .
The inference to be drawn from the
above is that Bogart imagined himself
the victim of a conspiracy to oust him
from the Postmastership, and in order
to discover the conspirators he opened
letters addressed to Republican poli
ticians.
WILL END IN SMOKE
AND DREYFUS' PARDON
LONDON, March 10.â The Daily News
publishes an interview with Count
Ferdinand Watsin .Esterhazy. who is
represented as having said: "The fire
works of the Dreyfus affair are only
just commencing. One thing is cer
tain. It is all up with General de 80-is
deffre. He and General Poget are re
sponsible for Colonel Henry's forgery
and death. All the excitement, how
ever, will end in smoke and the par
don of Dreyfus."
The Paris correspondent of the Daily
News, who secured the interview, says:
"There is a curious connection between
this statement by Esterhazy and a
statement made by M. Drumont in the
anti-Semite Libre Parole. He also
throws General de Boisdeffre over and
says he will be expelled from the
army."

DANGER OF
AN ARMED
COLLISION
â  - â 
Canadian Miners Encroach
Upon Territory in
Alaska.
EXPULSION THREATS
State Department Has Informed
Great Britain and It Is Hoped
Intruders Will Be Called Off.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 9.â The Her_Jd's
Washington correspondent sends thÂ»
following: There is grave danger of an
armed collision between American and
Canadian miners in the Porcupine
River region on the boundary between
Alaska and British territory.
This part of the Alaska boundary is
not in any diplomatic dispute. It i?
defined clearly by treaty and follows
the 141 st meridian of west longitude.
The location of this meridian and of the
boundary is merely a matter of sur
veying. A surveying party sent out by
the United States some years ago to
co-operate with the Canadian party in
locating the 141 st meridian fixed the
point at which the meridian crosses the
Porcupine River. The Canadian sur
veyors did not get over this part of the
line, but it is probable that if they had
they would have located the meridian
practically in the same place as' that
determined on by the Americans,- as
wherever the two surveys covered the
same ground they practically coincided.
Despite the fact that the location of
the boundary has thus been determined
beyond any reasonable doubt the Can
adians have encroached six miles or
more on the American side, where they
claim the right to stake claims and
search for gold, and deny the same
right to Americans. The Americans
have threatened to expel the Canadians
by force, and it is feared that a con
flict may be brought on.
The situation is so serious that upon
information contained in a letter from
Governor Brady of Alaska to the Sec
retary of the Interior the Secretary of
State has called the attention of the
British Government to the action of the
Canadians arid has asked to have them
recalled to their own territory.
It is not believed that the British
Government has in any way supported
the trespassers, but it has been sug
gested that the Canadian Colonial Gov
ernment, which has shown a disposition
to disregard the rights of the United
States even to the extent of clashing
with the home government in London,
has probably connived at the action of
the Dominion miners. It has, the offi
cials think, perhaps secretly encouraged
the- Canadian, miners .with; a view of
claiming rights in the Porcupine region
which would only be conceded in re
turn for a port and the cession of ter
ritory in the southern part of Alaska
so as to give an entrance to the Klon
dike from the Pacific through British
territory.
It is believed here that Great Britain
will recall the Canadians, and .it is
hoped this will be done before any
trouble occurs.

THE CASTRO GANG
SALINAS, March Old Castro
vllle, that little village which is
situated about eight miles from
here, has now thoroughly thrown
off the lethargy under which it has been
held for so long, and now every prom
inent citizen in the place is aroused to
the fact that the gang of lawbreakers
which has been holding sway there for
some time must be broken up at once
and permanently. The Douglass tragedy
has so aroused the citizens of that place
that every one of them is trying to
ferret out what is not known about the
"Nafii nine," or that gang of men regu
larly organized and banded together for
the sole purpose of committing crime
ln the old town which bears the name
of an ancestor of the ringleader. Pete
Castro. Every day more details of the
Douglass affair come to light, showing
the brutality as well as utter degrada
tion of the man now in custody, and
the men who are supposed to be his ac
complices.
Since the capture of Pete Castro by
Sheriff Farley Tuesday an easier feel
ing prevails, and the citizens believe it
â will be the means of breaking up the
.marauders and thereby putting a stop
to such lawlessness. This lawlessness
has been known to exist for several
months, but no one seemed able to put
a stop to it. Even if the officers would
arrest any one of the "nine" and the
-District Attorney would try to prose
cute the culprit, by some means the
supposed criminal would manage to get
enough men on the jury to either ac
quit him or else force a new trial. The
result of each trial being the same, the
charge would be dismissed by the Pros
ecuting Attorney when he found out
that every jury would be "fixed."
The lawlessness became so great that
people would be robbed and would
either not dare to complain or else
â would tell of it only secretly. They
"would not swear out a warrant for fear
that the suspected party would return
to their home and either commit some
other violence upon them or burn their
home. It is asserted by some of the
citizens that mysterious fires have been
started in the town and houses burned.
All such cases are now in some man
ner connected with this band of ma
rauders, or at least credited to them.
To-day facts were brought to light
which tend to prove that Castro or his
gang tried to rob and possibly murder
an old lady who resides not far from
the Douglass home. Mrs. Johanna
Daily, a widow over 60 years of age.

night of January 7. while at her home,

lowing story:
"Yes, the Nafii gang have been try
ing to rob me, and I don't know but
what they would have done so had not
assistance arrived soon enough to
thwart their plans. About midnight on
the 7th of January I was aroused from
my sleep by a knock at the front door.
I went there, asked what was wanted
and received the reply that it was word
from my son. He was working on the
section of the Southern Pacific, and
I imagined there must be something
the matter as he was not to be homo
that night. I opened the door, and as
soon as I did so I was grabbed by the
shoulders in a very rough manner by
a young man. I, of course, screamed.
The ruffian then took hold of my
throat and was choking me when as
sistance arrived. He imagined, no
doubt, that I was alone, but it just
happened that a lady friend had come
in late and remained during the night.
She heard the scream, saw the diffi
culty, and securing a hatchet she came
to my assistance. The man tried to get
his pistol, but she was too quick for
him. He went out of the door fast and
succeeded in getting away before he
could be harmed or captured. I have
been in dread of my home being burned
ever since. I had one man arrested,
but it did no good. He was acquitted
of the charge just because I was not
murdered, I suppose."

FOUNDER'S DAY
AT STANFORD
Address of Dr. Kellogg,
Noted Co-Worker.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
9. There was special significance in
the exercises held in the chapel to
night in celebration of founder's day.
for the address was given by Dr. Mar
tin Kellogg, president of the University
of California, Stanford's great . co
worker. His subject was "Economics
of Education."
"The questions which have to be
answered in the education of econ
omy," said the speaker, "are: Does
education pay? How much of it will
pay?" These queries, the noted edu
cator stated, were affected by the
question "What will be best for me as
a man. as a citizen, in years to come?"
As the student goes deeper and deep
er into studies, money consideration is
not the only view. The new question
of the personal value of education in
terms of manhood comes more and
more into sight. The farmer, how
ever, cannot be disregarded, as one
must have a little spot in which to
plant bread and butter bread.
While admitting that man may gain
a good education individually, the ad
vantages of the college in competent
instructors, books and the companion
ship of co-workers, he urged, achieved
better results. The college, he stated,
does not insure a good product, but it
is not to blame for failures. Every
man is arbiter of his own develop
ment. Intellectually he is a law unto
himself.
The noted lecturer urged education to
be a paying investment for every one,
as culture should not Interfere with
one's doing things nearest his hands,
even if not along professional lines.
Professions, he declared, would become
overcrowded by the output of colleges
and the educated should not scorn
manual labor, but be satisfied to do
things that they would have had to do
before taking a college course. The
field for cultured rich was shown to
be in uncompensated medical work
among the poor and in free Instruction
to those desirous of education. The
best field for gratuitous service Dr.
Kellogg held to be in municipal poli
tics, where good, honest fighters were
needed to overthrow unscrupulous
Dosses.
_ A better employment for rich young
women than the tiresome claims of so
ciety, the speaker said, could be found
in the leisurely production of worthy
pieces of literature, in eager and pro
longed devotion to art studies and in
good samaritan settlements for the up
lifting of the unfortunate poor of cities.
In conclusion. President Kellogg said:
"Will this institution become too great?
In connection with other universities
which in various centers are drawing
to themselves increasing numbers, will
there be too many to fill these pleasant
halls to overflowing? Not if our reason
ing has been correct. Suppose that you
have a thousand, with a like multipli
cation elsewhere. Will the fc-unders be
shorn of their honor? Nay, rather let
common people flock by hundreds of
thousands to higher institutions of
learning, then the whole mass of the
community will be lifted to a happier
level and all will rise up and call such
founders blessed."
Death From Heart Disease.
MILL VALLEY, March 9. - Oscar
Schneider returned from San Francisco
last Saturday evening and found his wife
lying dead on the kitchen floor. Mrs.
Schneider was afflicted with heart dis
ease and was Injured a short while ago by
falling from a bicycle while suffering
from an attack of her ailment. Dr. John
J Spottiswood, who 1? a Deputy Health
Officer and authorized to act ln such
cases, gave his consent to the burial.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1899.
marvelous, and although he asserts his
innocence of any crime, and especially
the Douglass affair, yet he does not
have that same nonchalant manner he
possessed while in his old haunts. He
realizes the enormity of the crime with
which he is at present accused, but
claims he can easily prove his inno
cence when the excitement has quieted
down in Castrovllle. Castro has two
charges at present against himas
sault to commit murder and felonious
assault, both upon the person of Mrs.
James Douglass. It is claimed other
charges will be brought against him.
Five other members of his gang are
also under surveillance, but one, F. W.
alias "Buck" Silva, has skipped -town
and has thus far eluded the pursuit of
the officers. Silva left Castroville the
morning after the Douglass affair, as
matters were getting pretty warm
for him, and the feeling was so intense
against his partner, Castro, that he
feared vengeance might be wreaked"
upon him. .
James Douglass, the infuriated hus
band who nearly succeeded in putting
an end to Castro's life at Pajaro when
Sheriff Farley and posse made the cap- *
ture, saw the accused man in the !
County Jail to-day. The scene of their
meeting was quite impressive and at
times rather exciting. Castro kept quite
cool while Douglass at times would be
come angered. He asked the prisoner
many- questions in regard to the affair |
of Sunday night, but received rather
unsatisfactory answers. The scratches
on the face which it is claimed were
received in the struggle with Mrs. ;
Douglass were explained by Castro as
the effects of trying to crawl through
the brush in his escape. The large
coal oil stains upon the coat sleeves j
were said by the prisoner to be due to i
his handling it at a store, when as a j
matter of fact it was. believed to be j
from a .lamp which his victim, had in
her hand at the time of the attack and i
which was broken, thereby spilling its ;
contents upon his coat. Douglass had
a half-hour's talk with the accused man \
and then left after telling him that he I
would give him justice if he was not to j
get it by the courts.
The preliminary hearing will take
place to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock, I
and although Sheriff Farley will take !
his prisoner to Castrovllle guarded it j
is feared something might occur should i
the vigilance committee deem it advisa
ble to interfere. Although the lynching
excitement has somewhat subsided, the
feeling against Castro is still. very great
and is liable to break out any time.
Sheriff Farley claims he will protect his
prisoner at any cost. Castro, however,
fears to be taken to his home town and
asked that the trial be conducted here.
It is also asserted in the old town that
should Castro not get a fair deal at
the trial to-morrow-, according to the
ideas of the gang, trouble from that
quarter might be expected. Sheriff Far
ley will therefore be between two op
posing factions, but claims he will have
enough deputies to cope with any
trouble.
WORST STORMS
IN TWENTY YEARS
Many Disasters in the
Atlantic.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March 9.â Losses at sea of
life and shipping in the great storms of
the first two weeks In February are only
now beginning to be apparent.
. The insurance men regard this as the
most disastrous season in twenty years.
How great a disaster storms that lasted
from February _ to February 12 were to I
merchant shipping can be partly appreci
ated from the list of steamships that
sailed from North American ports be
tween January 20 and 27 and have not
since been heard from. They are believed
to have gone down with all on board.
Tbey are the Plctou, Laughton, Dora Fos- ;
ter, Minister Mayback, Oberon, Allegheny,
Arona and Port Melbourne.
The eight missing ships carried 240 men,
and with the cargoes with which they
were laden were valued at more than
12,000,000. All but one were built of steel,
and were believed to' be capable of fight- I
ing any storms with which they might
meet.
Besides these vessels that are overdue
and considered as numbered among the
lost, the burdens of shipping insurance
men have been increased by the number
of wrecks, not directly due to the storm
of vessels stranded and broken up within
the last few weeks. Among these are
the Bellova. in the New York and River
Plata trade, which went ashore at Mal

being worth $300,000; the Labrador
wrecked off Skerry March 1, worth
with her cargo from $500,000 to $750,000; the
Moravia, stranded on Sable Island Feb
ruary 12 and worth $200,000.
Besides these thirty or more big vessels
have been reported in distress, not to
speak of hundreds of sailing craft that
must have been destroped but will not
be called overdue for weeks yet. Even the
damage to ships reported in distress is
not nearly known. - -w.

DESTITUTION VERY
GREAT AT DAWSON
Coqsul McCooK Reports That
Maoy flmericao Citizens Are
iQ Need of flid.
WASHINGTON, March 9.â The United States Consul at Dawson, J.
C. McCook, under date of January 31, informs the Department of State
concerning the condition of the people there as follows: "The situation
here as to persons who will bo out of food in a couple of months is
becoming very serious. Many hundreds will be so situated as will have
to be helped out when navigation opens.
"Many have gone out over the ice and are going out daily, while more
are remaining in the hope that they will be able to strike some pay on
claims they either own themselves or are working on claims leads from
others. Applicants are daily at this office for relief.
"The indigent sick so far have been taken care of by the relief
committee and by the local authorities, the latter seeing the necessity
of taking a hand in relief work. The destitute sick, while many of them
are not paupers in the strict sense of the word, being practically with
out funds, are compelled to call on the relief committee and will finally
pay when they hear from the outside with remittances.
"The relief committee at this place is unable to extend any more aid,
as all funds collected have been exhausted and they are some $2000 in
debt. The greatest evil, however, will be the large number of people who
have exhausted their supplies and who will fail to succeed in getting
paying claims.
"I know it is not customary for any nation to provide for destitute
citizens out of their country, still I feel it is my duty to put this matter
before you to "take whatever action you may deem best."
MOVEMENT TO
OUST TOM REED
This Time It Really
Seems in Earnest.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel.
Washington, March 9.
The old talk of deposing Reed as
Speaker is revived once more. This
time there really seems to be an earn
est and fairly well organized effort,
backed, it is believed, by leading sup
porters of the administration. This
morning's papers print Reed's letter to
General Sherwood of Ohio in answer to
that gentleman's suggestion that Shaf
ter should be court martialed for his
alleged criticism of Reed for opposing
the administration's policy. Mr. Reed
wrote in reply:
"I suppose General Shaffer was look
ing for a furlough on full pay." This,
of course, was a thrust at General
Eagan also. Speaker Reed's unbridled
and sarcastic tongue has made him un
popular with administration leaders.
An instance of this was just before the
adjournment of Congress. He met
Representative Lacey of lowa in the
House lobby and said: "Lacey. you
look so much like Alger I fear your
friends will want to whitewash you.
This reached Alger's ears and made for
Reed another administration enemy.
Mr Reed's criticisms of President Mc-
Kinley and his policy are too well
known to call for comment here.
An effort is being made to induce
Representative Sherman of New- YorK
to decline the appointment of Ap
praiser at New York and declare him
self a candidate for the Speakership
against Mr. Reed. Sherman though
elected to the next Congress, has been
nominated and confirmed by the Sen
ate to one of the Appraiserships- at
New York, but has not yet accepted
the position, and he could decline it
and remain in the House if he desired
Composition to Speaker Reed is based
on his alleged hostility to the adminis
tration, which, it is claimed, found ex
pression in antagonizing during the
Fifty-fifth Congress measures and
plans favored by the administration.
It is recognized by those who are hos
tile to Mr. Reed that ' he possesses
great strength, and that it is not going
to be an easy matter, if indeed It is
possible, to defeat him. Therefore they
want to be surer of their ground be
fore making an open move in the mat
ter What is being done now is being
done quietly. It is calculated by those
who would overthrow him that by his
hostility to the Nicaragua canal, to the
arid land appropriations and to numer
ous things popular in the West, he has
excite a feeling of resentment among
a considerable number of Republicans
in the House, which may contribute
to his defeat if the right sort of man
can be found to make the contest.
There is a feeling of intense hostility
behind the movement involving poli
tic sof the party in the future.
SPECIAL RATES FOR
THE EDUCATORS
OMAHA. March ..-After a three days
conference, In which two roads did all the
conferring and the other sixteen ac
quiesced, the transcontinental lines have
adjourned and the rates made by the
Southern Pacific and Santa Fe for the
National Educational Association in Los
Angeles in July will stand The rates
will be $52 for the round trip from Mis
souri River common points. The selling
dates will be June 26 to 28. inclusive, and
July 2 to 8. Inclusive, with the final return
limit September 4. .
On all business which goes out over the
Ogden gateway lines, which includes all
the Omaha roads, and returns via Port
land an extra $5 will have to be paid.
Whether the roads will pay it to hold
their rate equality with that of the South
ern Pacific and the Santa Fe. or add it
to the price of the ticket is a problem
yet to be solved. If the price be added
to the ticket a person may go from Kan
sas <'ity to Los Angeles and return by
Portland for $64 50. while from Omaha the
same trip will cost $69 50. The Southern
Pacific will charge $12 50 for the haul from
San Francisco to Portland, and in addi
tion the Ogden gateway lines will have
to pay the same road $5 extra for the re
turn haul from Los Angeles to San Fran-
C OfÂ°'the $52 which is to be charged for
the straight ticket $2 goes to the Educa
tional Association. If the passenger re
turns by Portland $25 will go to one of
the northern lines. The Southern Pa
cific will get $13 25 for the haul from Os
den to Los Angeles, and this leaves $11 .o
to be divided among the connecting lines
taking the business to Ogden from the
Missouri River. V';_ ; V , ..
The Great Northern at the close of the
meeting announced a one-way rate of $23
from St. Paul to Portland, going into ef
fect Monday and continuing every day
without limit as to time. The road states
that this rate is in pursuance of its plan
to settle up the Northwest, as the rate
applies to all points on the line where
the regular rate to Portland Is more than
$25 Other roads will meet the cut. .

JAPANESE COME
UNDER CONTRACT
Labor for the. Northern
Railroads.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 9.â lt is claimed,
and some Customs officers admit, that
a great majority of Japanese laborers
now entering the United States at
Northwestern ports are contract la
borers intended for service on the
Northern transcontinental railroad
lines. There are one or more opera
tors, with headquarters in Tacoma and
Salt Lake, who are furnishing large
numbers of Japanese laborers to the
Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, Ore
j gon Short line and Oregon Railway
I and Navigation Company for service as
section hands, shovelers and workmen
| with work trains.
From these facts the inference is
drawn that hundreds of Japanese who
are now entering this country monthly
at Portland, Tacoma, Seattle and from
British Columbia are brought across
the Pacific under contract to work for
these operators at so much per month
and their board. Several customs offi
cers believe this to be true, but will not
permit the use of their names because
the rules of the department do not per
mit it. They say that the wholesale ar
rivals of Japanese workmen and the
fact that they go to work for the rail
roads within a very short time there
after is conclusive evidence to their
minds, and yet it is not evidence suffi
cient to warrant any prosecutions un
der the contract labor law.
Though every steamship brings over
several hundred Japanese they are di
vided among at least three different
ports, with the apparent object of
awakening as little suspicion as pos
sible. Each steamship load is landed
gradually at Victoria, Port Townsend
and either Tacoma or Seattle. The ma
jority are landed in British Columbia
and quietly come across the boundary
in small parties until sent Into the In
terior for railroad work. During the
last two years the railroads named, to
gether with the Canadian Pacific, are
said to have engaged several thousand
Japanese. They receive scarcely half
the wages paid white workmen. The
latter are becoming alarmed and pur
pose organizing to keep their Asiatic
competitors out.
NO STORM WILL THEN
ESCAPE OBSERVERS
Importance of the Proposed Exten-
sion of the Weather Bureau
Signal Service.
WASHINGTON, March 9.â When the
proposed extension of the Weather Bu
reau signal service shall have been set in
operation it will, say the officials, be next
to impossible for a storm of any impor
tance to escape the notice of observers.
The plan of extensions comprehends the
establishment of additional observations
in arid and subarid regions of the West.
It is stated by Willis L. Moore, chief of
the Weather Bureau, that the places of
observation In arid and sub-arid districts
of the country have been so widely
separated hitherto that it has not
been possible to secure a perfect survey
of the distribution of temperature and
atmospheric conditions so essential to
making accurate forecasts not only for
those regions but for the extensive area
further to eastward. Provisions have
been made for the installation and equip
ment of stations at Kalispell, Mont.. Boise
City, Idaho, Mount Tamalpais, California,
Flagstaff, Ariz., and Fort Worth, Tex.
Arrangements have also been made for
the establishment of additional stations
In the South and central valleys as fol
lows: Meridian. Miss.. Macon, Ga.. Lex
ington. Ky., Elkins, W. Va., and Evans
ville. Ind. It Is claimed that the estab
lishment of these stations will not only
assist in the development of agricultural
and Industrial Interests in the respective
States in which they are located but will
also be. of material benefit in Improving
warnings and forecasts, especially for re
gions west of the Rocky Mountains.

JACK THE PEEPER
CAUGHT AT SALINAS
SALINAS, March 9.â When it was de
veloped this evening that a crime some
what similar to that of the Douglass
attack had been detected in Salinas last
night the excitement was high, and for
a time trouble was thought imminent.
For several weeks lately guests of the
Bardln House of this city, or at least
those having rooms on the third floor,
have been annoyed during the night by
noises on the roof of the hotel, which
appeared to be people walking around,
but it was hardly thought that this
could be the case. Late last night,
however, the clerk was summoned from
the office' by a call bell ringing furious
ly, and on going to the room indicated
was informed by the woman occupant
that a man was on the roof and had
attempted to get into rier room through
the skylight. It appears that the ser
vants of this hotel occupy inside rooms
and that the skylights in the roof are
the only means of getting daylight in
them. The glass is not frosted, and
last night one of the woman servants
[when about to retire thought she saw
-' ... *','
THE EMi-OKlum.
a man's face at the pane. * She was not
sure, but waited until it appeared again
'â  and this time close to the glass she
i recognized it to be a man's at once. She
j made the call for the clerk. Upon tell-
I ing him her story he armed himself and
I went to the roof and found "Jack the
i Peeper" in the act of spying into an
; other young woman's room through the
skylight, The man was recognized to
be a factory employe and a guest of the
hotel. Whether or not the man intend
ed robbery is not known. He made all
' kinds of excuses as to why he was on
the roof, star-gazing, etc.. and was
compelled to come down. Upon reach
ing the street he was given a beating.
This afternoon, however, when the
story became known reports were re
ceived from various reputable ladles,
single and mothers of families, that
similar occurrences had taken place for
several weeks past. A man had been
j seen peeping through the windows and
they were afraid to go out unless with
male members of their family. A watch
was set, but was futile till last night.
The young man caught is a boiler
maker at Spreckeis and â¢ respectably
connected in San Francisco, where his
parents reside. No arrests have been
made, but the fellow caught has re
ceived notice to leave town or he will
be treated with great severity if not to
a coat of tar and feather*

THE BRAND OF THE BEOST.
IN an argument against the bill to prohibit treating
by candidates for public office, which was justly
drowned in a shower of ridicule, one of the Sena
tors at Sacramento is reported to have said: "I pro
pose to buy drinks if I want to, and spend my money
and put 'S. P.' on my necktie." This gentleman is
one of the supporters of Dan Burns, and, with
twenty-six associates, is engaged in the work of mis
representing his constituents and dishonoring the
State. The validity of the claim, so arrogantly ex
pressed, will not be seriously disputed, at least to the
extent of its proud assertion of the right of subser
viency to the railroad. Every member of the Legis
lature who persistently votes for Dan Burns and
unites in the daily intrigues to capture the Republican
party is clearly entitled to put "S. P." on his neck
tie. In fact, the general opinion is that it is a dis
tinctive mark, by which political character and stand
ing can be identified. There are, however, fifty-eight
other Republicans in the Senate and in the Assembly
who have not been lassoed and branded by the cow
boys of the railroad, and by them, by. the Republican
party, and by substantial citizens of California, with
out distinction of part}-, it is devoutly hoped that the
Burns "necktie party" may end in a "dull thud," fol
lowed by asphyxiation. Should this holy aspiration
be gratified there may be twenty-seven legislators,
each of whom will be deprived of his political tod
dies, even though purchased with his own money.
The mixtures prepared at the railroad bar have a
very exciting influence upon living topers, but they
often have a tightening effect upon a cravat, and they
will not resuscitate a political corpse.
RUDYARD KIPLING'S FAME.
THE convalescence of Rudyard Kipling has been
observed with gratitude by the people and even
by rulers throughout the world. He has
emerged from the shadows of death when his fame
and his influence have become resplendent and are
blended with conditions that insure their enduring
vitality. His life has assumed an immortal type, for
it has absorbed the deepest and most pervasive
Thought that silently dwells and works in the mind
of humanity until revealed by the genius and ex
pressed through the lips of a Master.
The intellectual and -spiritual constellation of a cen
tury includes but a few stars, in which all that re
mains of its light is focussed. The world is tem
pestuous, but through its gathering clouds, its roar
ing winds and its heaving waves the gleam of mere
ability, of mere learning, or of mere power, is never
wholly obscured. The generations sail on and on
in their restless and endless voyage toward the un
reached Ideal, and the identity of their guides and
their leaders, like the flitting of a bird, for a moment
flashes and then vanishes into space. But here and
there pure intelligence, the luminous shape of
original truth, condenses into a fixed star, and thus
are formed the immovable constellations by which
man is raised to the perception of the Infinite.
The prophetic soul of Isaiah, the pure reason of
Paul, the dramatic universality of Shakespeare, the
rapt contemplation of Milton, the calm philosophy of
Wordsworth, the divine sensibility of Tennyson, will
shine through "the encircling gloom" while time and
mortality last, and with these individualized uplifted
and perpetuated lives the fame of Kipling has already
been grouped. For him literature, prose and verse
alike have been a means and not an end. His in
spiration forced him onward through successive
phases until he sounded the prophetic generalizations
of his race. In the early part of his career, as no
ether man has ever done, he saturated his mind with
the abstract mysticism of India, and in striking phrase
and with powerful illustration poured the clear pre
cipitate into the treasures of knowledge. Later he
widened his range and struck the chord of reverential
memory until before the God of nations the splendors
of imperialism dwindled and its arrogance was hum
bled. The depth and the simplicity of the "Re
cessional" are only matched by the Invocation that
on the margin of the Pacific restored earnestness and
truth to a national anniversary and filled the channel
of pessimism with the spirit of optimism. And when,
before these incomparable appeals to the latent
sublimities in man had wrought their perfect work,
war and victory for the moment submerged our judg
ment and the delirium of imperialism seized our na
tional imagination, the revived prophet of civilization
blew his blast of warning to which the heart and the
intellect of mankind have responded. Thus his in
dividuality has become fixed in the constellation of
the nineteenth century. Before him may lie even
greater triumphs, but already he has won that highest
greatness which is unsoiled by low ambition or by
sordid aims. Sic itur ad astra.
THE CLOSING SCENES.
LAST week it was announced by authority that
Burns would be elected Senator on Wednes
day. But that day's ballot was taken . and
Burns was as far away from the prize he covets as he
was on the first ballot, last January. The Wednesday
ballot and the day's session had features that sug
gested the miscarriage of a plan. The element in our
population which backs Burns was missed from its
accustomed walk and conversation, for it had all been
summoned to Sacramento. The general public was
glad of its absence, but Sacramento did not rejoice at
its presence. Least of all was the legislature grati
fied, for the chambers wherein the two houses meet
are not well ventilated at best, and can stand only
slight mephitic additions to their atmosphere.
The plan, whatever it was, that had caused all the
forces to be ordered to the front failed in execution
and caused an ebullition of bad temper exceeding any
other outbreak of the whole session. A potency j
of passion was shown by the Burns forces that for a j
time broke down the order and discipline of the j
House. It was a testy, gnat-like temper, under which
the tide of battle rose and rolled from the Legislature
into the hotels, ending in personal encounter and the j
challenge and threat of further blows and bruises. All j
this is to be regretted. But it must be added to the 1
dry year and other passing mishaps and misfortunes
which afflict the State. It originated in defiance of the
will of the majority. The Republican majority in the j
: Legislature and in the State has taken a position on
the candidacy of Burns from which no intrigue has
moved it. That majority has patiently waited to hear
what Mr. Burns proposes, and then it disposes by
standing firmly against every plan laid by him to elect
himself.
Every expedient known to the art of intrigue has
been resorted to by him. It was announced that he
was to win in a walkover on the first ballot. Tlie
majority lined up and he did not win. Again and
again it has been announced that he was to win at a
certain moment. Stampedes have been forecast and
foretold, but when the moment came the same patient
majority stood its ground and there was no stampede.
Then came the Pronunciamento of the Junta, in
which Burns dwelt on the charms of majority rule
in a caucus in terms of praise equal to the phrases of
the Song of Solomon or the Passionate. Pilgrim.
But again the majority stood unmoved, declaring that
only it could order a caucus and would refuse, in the
interest of party character and success.
So. in whatever direction Burns has turned he has
encountered that solid wall, the majestic bulwark of j
party purity and trustee of the party's future, the ma
jority. It has not bandied epithets with him, nor j
blushed at his cajolery, nor paled at his threats. It j
has simply stood for the highest aspirations of the j
party against the lowest aspirations of the dcfilers of j
party. No wonder that his simulated hope and pre- !
tended patience and professed superiority of plans
have hammered against this solid wall of the majority i
until, mad with many bruises, temper, and very bad
temper, expressed in unprintable language, displaced '
all pretense and left the Burns fight standing in its j
natural colors.
The majority meantime can only stand where it |
planted its feet and formed its line when the session
began against the election of Burns. And to prevent
that it should not relax its vigilance nor forget the
challenge and password until the gavel falls and the
houses adjourn without day.
SENATOR MOREHOUSE'S WISDOM.
WE note with considerable gratification the fact
that Senator Morehouse of Santa Clara
County has concluded to withdraw his bill for
the indiscriminate slaughter of journalists. This
measure, it will be remembered, provided an open
season for newspaper men; that is to say, it author
ized any person who felt aggrieved at the publication
of an article intended to injure his feelings to kill the
writer. The fact that the article contained criticisms
calculated to make him angry justified the deed of
the murderer.
We do not know what reason Senator Morehouse
assigns for the .withdrawal of his bill, the official an
nouncement of his intention not having conveyed to
the public the required explanation. But we pre
sume that he has been influenced to some extent by
the arguments leveled at his' creation by the press of
the State. We remember having pointed out to the
honorable gentleman the possibility that his open sea
son for newspaper men might possibly be turned into
an open season for lawyers and politicians, but we
cannot say whether this consideration affected his
course. The fact remains, however, that if this bill
were passed it is extremely possible that a larger num
ber of "irate subscribers" would be killed than news
paper men.
One effect of the measure could not fail to be the
prompt and complete arming of the journalistic pro
fession. Every scribbler in the State would become a
walking arsenal, since all of them would know that
anybody could kill them for real or fancied grievances
on sight. The result of this universal arming of
journalists would certainly be indiscriminate
slaughter. Readers of newspapers would have to
carry their hands high in the air or be shot down
everywhere, for it could not be expected that the
journalist would take any unnecessary chances.
Every man who inadvertently dived into his pocket
for his handkerchief would be sure, if a journalist
were in the vicinity, to receive a bullet for his care
lessness.
We are glad, therefore, that Senator Morehouse has
withdrawn his bill. It was an unnecessary and dan
gerous measure â not dangerous for newspaper men,
but dangerous for lawyers, politicians and lobbyists.
It belonged to a species of legislation concerning the
effect of which there was no problem. Like the
crab, it was bound to go backward, and, like . the
boomerang, it might at the very first have resulted in
a large funeral in Santa Clara County and the disap
pearance from the public stage of a very distinguished
lawyer and statesman. *
COLONEL GRAVES' EXPERIMENT.
COLONEL JOHN TEMPLE GRAVES is a
Georgian of repute. There was a time when
the people of that State thought he would step
into the shoes, fill the hat and wear the mantle of the
gifted Grady, but they were disappointed. Neverthe
less the Colonel has managed to achieve much. For
example, he has acquired such a repute as a lecturer
that he has been called to make a tour of States
so far away from hi? native soil as lowa, Nebraska,
Minnesota and the Dakota*, and. having made the
tour, he has gone back to Georgia and proven him
self to be an observant traveler and a veracious
THE SAN FRANCISCO CAM,, FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1809.
chronicler by telling the "goober grabblers" several
facts that he learned in the Northwest.
Thus he is reported to have told his folks- at home
that the mention of McKinley's name "evokes the wild
est applause from any popular assembly in the \\ est,
while no enthusiasm whatever is displayed at Bryan's
name." He is further reported to have declared him
self to be "amazed and even indignant at the com
parative apathy with which a tribute to this really
great American is everywhere received, ' and finally
he is quoted as saying, "The silver cause is in definite
eclipse."
The Colonel, it will be seen, had to go a long way
from home to learn the truth, but it is to his credit
that he did learn it and confess it and not ignore it.
That he was and is indignant over the lesson Â»*3 be
natural, but the Colonel had no reason for amaze
ment. What could he have expected? Would he in
this year of prosperity have the people applaud ?
calamity howler rather than the statesman whose ad
ministration has brought the prosperity? Would he
with the memory of the war fresh in the minds of all
have the people shout for a fiasco Colonel rathe* than
for the President who conducted the war? ' Would he
at a time when gold is flowing into the country and
the- affluent golden tide is everywhere blessing the
land have the people wax enthusiastic over free
silver and its howling dervish of a devotee?
The Colonel's indignation is pardonable, for it ii
human. Some of the best men in the world have been
roused to wrath by the stubbornness of facts, and not
a few have been even heard to swear at them. Reason
able men, however, are not amazed or even surprised
by such things. They recognize a fact when they see
it afar oft', and do not have to butt up against it be
fore they know what it is.
If Colonel Graves had kept his eyes open for the
last two years he would have perceived before he left
home how the political wind was blowing and would
have been spared the risk of taking personal observa
tions in the Northwest. That, moreover, would have
been greatly to his benefit, for it is clear the Colonel in
his lecturing threw out side remarks about McKinley
and Mr. Bryan to fee how they would be received, and
was immediately bowled over by the storm of Re
publican enthusiasm. It was like the case of a man
who should go out with a handful of straws to deter
mine the course of a zephyr and the next minute find
himself caught in a whirlwind and landed head down
ward in a remote county among rank strangers.
BRIBERY IN BUSINESS CIRCLES.
WHILE we are busily engaged in devising legis
lation to put an end to bribery in politics the
British arc trying to find some means of check
ing the practice in business circles. A bill for that
purpose drawn up by the Lord Chief Justice has been
submitted to Parliament and has been favorably re
ceived, although some of its strongest supporters are
doubtful whether it will be sufficiently effective to put
a stop to the practice altogether.
The movement is an outcome of the scandals con
nected with the Hooley bankruptcy case. It will be
remembered that the evidence given by Hooley dis
closed the fact that he had paid out large sums of
money to noblemen and other dignitaries of repute to
induce them to act as directors in his various specu
lative companies. These dignitaries served as decoy
ducks for the public, and by reason of having their
names the wily promoter was able to sell almost any
kind of stock at high prices.
Further investigation of the subject showed that
Hooley was by no means the only adventurous specu
lator who practiced the art of getting prominent men
to give the sanction of their names to risky enter
prises by paying them large sums of money. In fact,
it 'appears that for a long series of years British pro
moters have been using dignitaries to boom, their
schemes in much the same way that actresses and
opera singers are used in this country to advertise
soap or complexion powders. The deception thus
practiced has been carried to a point where it
amounts to downright fraud, and as. in the opinion of
the Chief Justice, the law at present is not capable of
dealing with the evil, new legislation is asked for.
The London Chronicle, which, with the British
press generally, favors the bill and recognizes the
need of remedial legislation, does not, however, ex
pect it to be wholly successful. It says there are many
forms of business bribery which can hardly be reached
by law. and cites two cases as examples. In one of
these a gentleman of high social standing was given
a position at good pay in a new company, and was
then required to make with his wife a summer holiday
visit at the seaside palace of the promoter. In the
other case a woman of rank was induced to assist in
the promotion of various companies, receiving there
for nothing in the shape of money, but an astonish
ing amount of jewels and other valuable presents at
Christmas time.
Tt would be difficult to prove bribery or fraudulent
intent in these cases. In the first it appeared the pro
moter simply desired social recognition for his wife,
and in the other there was nothing more than a
Christmas remembrance shown by a merchant to a
good customer. Many other illustrations might be
given of forms of such practices which no law can
reach, and yet which effectually serve to enable in
genious rascals to get into society and from that
vantage ground delude the public.
Notwithstanding the many forms of the evil which
the law cannot reach, the Chronicle holds it will result
in considerable benefit, for, as it says: '"It will catch a
great army of corrupt agents and buyers and of the
equally corrupt firms who bribe them. It is, in fact,
a bill to punish bribery in business life, and even if
it does not destroy that insidious evil it will largely
circumscribe its range." .
The inquest on embalmed beef proceeds, and the
jurors are now in Chicago watching the process of
packing. Possibly a packing establishment while in
operation for the edification of men empowered to
ruin it by a hostile verdict does not run on the plan
in vogue when a hurry order is being put up for
shipment to Cuba. The real question seems to be less'
as to what the packing houses do now than as to the
character of the stuff that poisoned our soldiers in the
tropics.
On general principles the powers .have no more
right to divide China than to steal the canary-colored
shirt of Li Hung Chang. Nevertheless, if. all of the
reports of butchery and outrage in that country, per
petrated on, missionaries, be confirmed, the only fear
is that the powers may fail to divide the antique bar
barism into pieces small enough.
Mr. Chirm of Kentucky recently advised a man
whom he did not like to go and get a gun. The man
did so, but when he returned with all due haste Chirm
was not. there. Nevertheless Chirm's reputation of
being a gun-fighter will cling to him, and his pros
pects for living long to enjoy it are good.
Foreign critics are now kind enough to tell us how
our little war should have been fought. They are
somewhat handicapped in pointing out any fatal de
fects, since one of the objects sought in fighting is to
lick the other fellow.

Soldier's Poem From Manila.
Seeking the bubble reputation at the cannon's mouth may be full of
clorv but to many of those at Manila it has brought a longing for other
things The following poem addressed to a friend of jthe writer -In this city
with directions to forward it to the Adjutant GenerA at Washington will
tell its own tale. It is perhaps the most unique of all appeals for discharge
from service in the torrid and withering Philippines. _
CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL. CORREGIDOR ISLAND. Jan. 21. 1599.
To the Adjutant General, United States Army, Washington, D. C.-Sir:
I want, to go home.
I want to go home. Please grant my plea
And from your army set me free.
I've fought and bled with my comrades true.
And lived on hardtack and horsemeat stew;
I've slept In a trench, and that's no lie.
When the rain like bullets fell from the sky.
When hist'ry's writ 'twill then be known
That I did my share. Now I want to go home.
I want to go home a battle-scared "Vet.",
To tell of scenes which I'll ne'er forget,
How when the battle raged fierce and high
I made the blistering Spanish fly;
How, armed and eager for the fray, â¢
I led the charge at Malate,
Right in the teeth of the hellish crew *
And captured the guns and the gunners too.
I want to go home. Of scenes of strife
I've had enough to last my life.
I want to live far from sounds of war.
The rifles' crash and the cannon's roar, x
In some small place to spend my days
In quiet pursuits and peaceful ways.
No more to wander, .no more to roam;
Mr. Adjutant General, please send me home.
Very respectfully yours, THOMAS P. COSGRAVE,
Private, Hospital Corps, U. S. Army.

ATTEMPT TO HASTEN ACTION
A COMMITTEE REPORTS ON THE
BRANCH COUNTY JAILS.
Finds Much to Commend in the Office
of Sheriff Martin, but Con
siders the Jails in Bad
Condition.
Chairman Buckingham of the Grand
Jury committee on schools precipitated a
heated discussion at the weekly meeting
of that body yesterday. He objected to
the slow progress made in the investiga
tion of the department as managed by the
last board. He wanted additional experts
employed, with the object of getting at
the bottom of the dishonest practices of
the men who involved the educational in
stitutions of this city and caused so much
suffering among the teachers.
The present administration came in for
criticism from Mr. Buckingham. He told
of visiting an evening school unannounced,
and finding two teachers in charge of one
class of less than twenty pupils. He
urged his fellow members on the jury to
take steps to press an investigation in an
effort to right the wrongs already done
and prevent turther abuses.
Captain of Police Gillen marshaled a
host of witnesses, who testified against
Policeman Cassius M. Blackmail. The lat
ter was implicated with a saloon-keeper in
the Mission named Rood in the robbing
of Cornelius Cronin, a miner from Ne
vada. Cronin was inveigled into the sa
loon on the night of December 13 and was
robbed of some $100. Blackman disap
eared soon after and no trace has ever
been found of him. It is believed he left
here in some ship bound for a foreign
port. The effort to have him indicted by
the Grand Jury is to provide against the
contingency of his being heard of in other
lands. No definite action was taken.
Sylvain Levy, chairman of the commit
tee having charge of the Sheriff's office
and County Jail, presented an elaborate
report. He complimented the present
Sheriff. Henry Martin, upon the high class
character of the men in his employ and
on the manner in which his office is con
ducted. The condition of the branch jails
near Ingleside was examined and the in
stitutions were found sadly in need of re
pairs throughout. The plumbing is de
fective, and many .inconveniences i are
lacking, accordine to the investigators.

G. E. Charming, special employe in his

questing him to take charge of the office

from New York of Major Moore's suc

is one of the major's closest friends and
stood by him through all his trouble, but
the evidence against the major was too
strong to pass unheeded and an army
of friends could not have saved him.
Major Moore is a peculiar character.
Not even . his most bitter enemies have
ever intimated that he was not honest
and industrious in the discharge of the
duties of his office. He had only two
'auks, and those were as wide as a
church door and as deep as a well. By
his persistent interference in small things
in and about the Custom-house he drew
upon himself the deadly enmity of almost
all the officials who were subject to his
surveillance. That was the one fault
that madt him unpopular. The other was
his Indiscriminate. love tor indiscriminate
women. It was Impossible for a lady
typewriter with any pretensions to good
looks to remain In his office, owing to his
Improper conduct. Outside of the office
he was often seen after dark with young
women of free and easy manners hieing
to some resort of cheap beer and tamales.
Sometimes the major entertained the
ladies of his choice in his own apartment,
but when he dwelt with church people
and wore a sanctimonious expression he
used to borrow the room of his special
employe. Will Gassaway, for an evening
occasionally to entertain his lady friends.
Later he showed his gratitude to Gassa
way by having him discharged from the .
office on the score of economy. v

TEACHERS NOT QUITE
READY TO COMPROMISE
Proposition From Other Creditors of the Board of
Education Taken Under Advisement.
THE public school teachers have
received a compromise offer
from the merchants and others
holding claims against the
School Department which they hardly
know what to do with. About a fourth
of the teachers in the department met
in the Girls* High School auditorium
yesterday afternoon and when the re
port of the committee on litigation
having in charge the collection of sal
aries for the months of November and
December last had been submitted
there was a lively discussion that did
not end unitl the meeting adjourned
to meet again a week from next Mon
day, when definite action will be
taken.
Elisha Brooks presided and first
called upon Charles H. Murphy, chair
man of the committee on legislation,
to tell what had been done on behalf
of the teachers. Mr. Murphy has been
In Sacramento the greater portion of
the time since the Legislature has*
been In session and he gave an inter
esting account of what had been ac
complished in the way of legislation
affecting education. The most impor
tant work accomplished, he said, was
the passage of a bill that will prevent
the loss of any portion of teachers'
salaries in future. This bill, which
was signed by the Governor Wednes
day and is now a law. provides for the
setting aside of a special fund by the
Count y Boards of Education on the Ist
of July of each year, to be known as
the teachers' salary fund. It is to be
based upon careful estimates of the
amount required for the purpose and
is to be ample to meet teachers' sal
aries for the ensuing fiscal year. The
measure passed the Assembly unani
mously and there was only one vote
against it in the Senate, that vote be
ing cast under a misapprehension.
Several other bills are pending in
one house or the other, all of which
contained, as originally introduced,

and stood up the bay under shortened
canvas.

from Hilo still stands as the record for
the season.
Charters are few and far between at
the present time and a number of Brit
some good and some objectionable
features. The committee had suc
ceeded, after much effort, in eliminat
ing all the obnoxious clauses, and
if the bills passed in their present
shape, as it seemed most probable
they would, the teachers would be
greatly benefited thereby.
Senate bill 53 passed the Assembly
yesterday and Assembly bill 639, with
the "tenure of office" clause knocked
out, would probably be passed. That
tenure of office clause had caused the
committee much worry, fur had it
been retained in the bill and become
law San Francisco teachers would all
have to be appointed each year, thus
throwing the department into the
hands of politicians.
â Mr. Murphy spoke of the glaring
errors made in printing the bills and
said it would be necessary to closely
scrutinize every measure that came
from the State Printer.
W. D. Kingsbury supplemented Mr.
Murphy's report of the work at Sac
ramento and closed with the state
ment that there was more important
business to come before the meeting

THE SAN FRANCISCO ' CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1899.
i ish vessels are going in to the lumber
trade sooner than lay up. Uncle Sam has
: a big lot of supplies on hand that he
; wants to get to Manila, and the chances
are that some of the British ships in port
! awaiting a charter may be taken. Steam
i ers cannot be secured and those that are
' now under charter to the Government are
' very much needed by their owners. If
ll 111 I â  â â â â â â  wT
salary- claims, he said, had resulted in
an effort on the part of the merchants
to compromise, which offer the attor
neys employed by the teachers had
strongly advised them to accept. In
brief, the plan of compromise submit
ted was this: There Is now available
something like $65,000 to $70,000 that is
to be divided equally between the mer
chants and teachers, giving the latter
about one-fourth of the amount due
them for the two months. A trus-
tee, to be selected by the merchants' |
and teachers' committee, is to take
charge of all available funds there
after and divide them among the
teachers and merchants. This trustee .
is to hold the teachers' warrants for
November and December, and that is .
what caused the trouble. ;
As soon as the reading of the report <
was finished Mr. Faulkner demanded ;
to know if it was the intention to as- >
sign the warants for two months for <
one-quarter of the amount due, and <
announced that he. for one, would j
never consent to such a plan. The la- <
dies heartily applauded this sentiment, -
and one charming miss declared she â¢
would rather. not receive a cent than }
to accept a quarter of what was due. j
Messrs. Kingsbury. Murphy and Mc- j
Carthy argued in favor of the plan, .
while Messrs. Edwards, Clark and i
White and Miss Conklln Inclined to -$
Mr. Faulkner's view. if; J
Mr. Edwards moved that the com- \
promise plan be printed on slips of pa- S
per and given to every teacher, for con- >
sideratlon, and the matter could come j
up again for action next Monday. He Â«
said that not more than a fourth of the ?
members of the department were pres- ]
ent, and it would be unfair to the ab- ,
sentees to dispose of their Interests in i
such haste. Â«
The advocates of the compromise op- j
posed further delay and recounted the >
cost of further litigation, but they j
were plainly in the minority; the ladles j
thought they had defeated the mer- ,
chants once in court and could see no J
reason for rushing into a compromise j
with the other creditors without giv- j
ing the matter any consideration. I
Then there was some discussion as to 1
the best time of holding the next meet- {
ing, and it was finally decided to set it j
for Monday, March 19, at 4 p. m.
sailing vessels can be procured at from
22 shillings 6 pence to 25 shillings a ton
the chances are that Uncle Sam will load
some of them. â  Bids will probably be
called for and then both American and
British owners will be able to make of
fers. The understanding is that, all
things being equal, the American ships
will be given the preference.
At present the following British ves
sels are available: Ships Afon Alaw, 1947
tons; Ben Lee. 2204 tons; Flintshire, 1226
tons; Leicester Castle, 2009 tons; Ditton,
2699 tons; British General, 1650 tons: and
the bark Cardigan Castle, 1121 tons. These
vessels would carry about 18,000 tons of
freight, and as Uncle Sam has only
about 7000 tons of supplies to send to the
Philippines he should be able to choose
among the vessels named. The Ditton
and Ben Lee or Afon Alaw would prob
ably carry all the stores on hand in the
quartermaster's department.
There have been a few changes among
the sergeants of the Harbor police. Ser
geant Charles Cullom. who has been on
night duty, will be welcomed back "at
the desk" in the station to-day. Sergeant
Flanders, who has been on the desk, goes
to the O'Farrell street station, while Ser
geant Brophy of the Central station will
take the night beat on East street, reliev
ing Sergeant Cullom. The changes go
into effect to-day.
The troubles of the Klondike steamer
City of Columbia seem to be never end
ing. She was purchased in the East and
started for San Francisco via the Straits
of Magellan with a number of gold hunt
ters, among whom were several women.
In the Straits of Magellan she ran on
some rocks and the Patagonians came
near to making soup out of the men and
slaves out of the women. At a critical
moment the vessel backed off into deep
water and the passengers escaped.
At Valparaiso the Columbia had to go
on the drydock for repairs, and when
these were made there was no money to
pay for them. The steamer was libeled
and held until money was obtained from
the East, and then the voyage was re
sumed.
Finally Puget Sound was reached on the
way to the Klondike, and there the party
went to pieces. The ship required more
repairs, and nobody had any money to
pay for them. The passengers claimed
they had been defrauded and libeled the
steamer for damages. Suit after suit was
brought against the vessel until there was
not a square inch from keelson to truck
that was not plastered with a libel suit.
Eventually the City of Columbia was
sold by the United States Marshal, and
her new owners fixed her up and put her
in the Honolulu trade. She left Seattle
with a full cargo and a number of pas
sengers; but misfortune was in her wake.
Captain and passengers did not agree,
and the vessel reached Hawaii with some
of the latter in irons. More libel suits
followed, and for months the steamer was
tied up in Honolulu. At last she got
away, but broke down at sea. After being
patched up she managed to reach Hilo,
but a few hours later sank at her anchor
age. She was raised again and taken to
Honolulu once more, where litigation
broke out* again. The crew had not been
paid since leaving Seattle, and merchants
wanted their money.
Once more the City of Columbia was
put up for sale, but owing to some mis
take in the advertisement there were very
few people present, and she was knocked
down to Captain Evans for $1500. This
was not near enough to pay the vessel's
debts, and now the Alameda brings the
news that the Judge has refused to con
firm the sale. A Chinese firm made affi
davit that it was prepared to pay $10,000
had its representative arrived in time at
the sale. Captain Evans has carried the
matter into the Supreme Court of Hawaii,
and there the City of Columbia's fate
rests at present.
A most enjoyable treat was given the
children of the Maria Kip Orphanage by
Mrs. Henry Peterson last Wednesday af
ternoon. The children, to the number of
twenty-five, went first to Mrs. Peterson's
home, where they partook of a sumptuous
lunch. Then they and their friends and
the friends of the orphanage to the num
ber of seventy-five went down to Folsom
street wharf, from where Mr. Peterson's
launches Amy and William D took them
out to the battle-ship lowa. The party
was shown over the huge fighting ma
chine, and all enjoyed themselves thor
oughly. Before disbanding, after the re
turn to terra firma, three cheers were
given by the children for Mr. and Mrs.
Peterson.
A. Thier, mate of the National City, met
with a serious accident yesterday. A
sling broke and some planks fell on him,
breaking his nose. He was treated at the
Harbor Hospital, and Dr. Fltzgibbon
thinks Thier is internally injured.
Uncle Sam has changed his mind, and
the City of Puebla will go back to Manila.
The vessel was rechartered yesterday and
will be got ready for another voyage as
quickly as possible. The Conemaugh
took- nearly all of her load of mules
aboard yesterday, and will probably get
away Saturday. _^ ,'i ..--.-'

THEY TALKED
GAS FOR THREE
WEARY HOURS
Finance Committee's
Inquiries End.
PRESIDENT CROCKETT ARGUES
UNDER OATH HE MAKES IM
PORTANT ADMISSIONS.
Expert Fred Holweg Gave Interest
ing Testimony on the Quality
and Cost of Gas in
This City.
J. B. Crockett, president of the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Light Com
pany, and Mayor Phelan had a verbal
sparring match last night that lasted two
hours, at the end of which time the bout
was declared a draw. Mr. Crockett then
crossed swords with Fred Holweg, gas
expert of the Finance Committee, and
the discussion that followed developed the
fact that Mr. Holweg, who keeps a drug
store at North Beach, has spent consid
erable time delving deep into the mys
teries of manufacturing gas.
When the investigation into the affairs
of the gas company, which was begun last
Tuesday night by the Finance Committee
of the Board of Supervisors, in order to
fix a compensation to be paid for lighting
the city during the last two months, was
resumed last night, President Crockett
was the first witness called upon to tes
tify.
Mayor Phelan had evidently spent many
hours preparing for the ordeal. He had
spread before him reports upon the sub
ject of municipal lighting from all over
the world, and questioned Mr. Crockett
closely on all matters pertaining to gas
and electric illumination from the time
the first gas plant was established in this
city up to the present day.
Mr. Crockett, who is an exceptionally
well posted man, answered his Honor's
questions with apparent honesty, and
never once during the two hours that he
was under fire did he find himself lost
for an answer.
He frankly admitted that there was an
understanding of a verbal nature between
his company and the San Francisco Gas
Improvement Company which enabled one
company to supply gas to consumers in
certain districts where the other com
pany has no mains, the company supply
ing the gas receiving the profit and the
other the cost of service. He also ac
knowledged that the two companies have
an agreement not to cut rates.
Mr. Crockett further stated, in answer
to various questions asked him, that the
gas supplied to households in various
portions of the city costs about 30 cents
a thousand feet to manufacture and 50
cents more to deliver it to the house
where it is consumed.
A report on the municipal lighting of
the city of Belfast, Ireland, was intro
duced for the purpose of showing how
much cheaper gas is supplied to that city
than it is to San Francisco. In defense
of his own position Mr. Crockett argued
that it would not only be unfair but un
reasonable for the Finance Committee to
allow the comparison of the gas rates
charged in the two cities to play any
part in the adjustment of the present dif
ficulty for the reason that the conditions
in Belfast were different from those ex
isting in this city. At least Mr. Crockett
believed they were, and as the Mayor was*
not familiar with the situation in Bel
fast so far as the production and manu
facture of gas is concerned the matter
was dismissed without any further argu
ment.
Fred Holweg was then called upon to
give expert testimony on the quality of
gas manufactured in this city and the
cost of its production. He was questioned
by the Mayor, Dr. Perrault and finally by
Mr. Crockett and his attorneys. Messrs.
Xix and Wheeler, and when Holweg left
the stand he also left an impression on
nearly all of his listeners that he knew a
thing or two about the manufacture of
gas. The Finance Committee will go over
all of the testimony introduced and de
cide upon the compensation to be allowed
the gas company some time next week.
CARL T. KIRCHHOFF'S WILL.

In the Divorce Court.
Decrees of divorce have been granted
Fred D. Everts from Carrie Eâ Everts
on the ground of willful desertion; Syl
vian Jalbert from Rosalie Jalbert on the
ground of habitual intemperance: Ger
trude I. Graham from Fred W. frraham
on the ground of extreme cruelty; and
James J. Malcolm from Ella M. Malcolm
on the ground of willful desertion. The
suit of Henry Le Blanch for a divorce
from Kate E. Le Blanch and that of the
wife against the husband was dismissed
yesterday by Judge Belcher, the couple
having forgiven each other and deciding
to enjoy the bliss of married life. Jennie
Loughran has sued Thomas Loughran
for a divorce, alleging cruelty as a cause
of action.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 9.â The result of to
day's trading was irregular, some of the spe
cialties showing advances, while most of the
standard shares were fractionally lower. The
activity in the initial and final trading with
dullness a large part of the day, was a coun
terpart of the dealings yesterday and the day
before, except that to-day trading was weak
in the final dealings, whereas on other days
the closing activity was marked by strength.
The specialties and the general market moved
considerably in the early dealings in sympathy \
with the coalers, which were stronger on con- j
tinued talk of the proposed deal, but subse
quently worked lower. The chief Flower
stocks were lifted from time to time, par
ticularly People's Gas and Brooklyn Transit,
which made net gains of about 2 points each.
Metropolitan Street Railway and Third Avenue
gained 1 -. and 7 points respectively. Sugar
and Pacific Mall were strong features in the
list, the latter on talk of Improved earnings.
There seemed to be a disposition for Boston !
banks to recall currency from New York, the |
premium of Boston exchange on New York
benlg 10918 c. The fact that the New York
BUb-Treasury will to-morrow draw on the
clearing house for $6,000,000 a part of the Cen- j
tral Pacific settlement money, some brokers :
considered did not warrant any expectation of I
money stringency, and there was no appear- j
ance of it in to-day's call money market.
There was a brisk demand in to-day's bond ]
market tor the semi-speculative issue, which '
generally ruled at Improved prices. Total sales, ,
83.350,000. United States 3s advanced % in the
price.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 9.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were dull on the danger of
trouble with Russia in China and the prospects
of a Â£3.000,000 budget deficit, owing to the ad
dition of Â£3.000,000 for the navy. The closing
was less apprehensive.
Americans opened rather under parity and
promptly advanced, expecting a repetition of
yesterday. Ontarioa and Readings led and
Baltimore and Ohios were in demand, j Ger
many bought Central Pacifies and St. Pauls.
New York opened well, but very soon attempted
to sell a small quantity, whereupon there was
a sharp drop, as London Is entirely dependent
on New York. There was a slight rally In
the street. ââ.
Coppers were good early. Tintos were 39%.

CHICAGO GRAIN - MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 9.â The prospect of any
improvement in the value of wheat looked very
bad at the commencement. The only food for
the bulls was the Michigan State crop report,
which said that four-fifths of the crop had
been seriously damaged by cold. On the other
hand Liverpool cables came %d to %d lower.
California had received a sprinkling of rain
and Russia officially reported last season's win- ,
ter crop 17 per cent larger than a year ago, j
with spring crops better by 14 per cent. The
Price Current was rather bearish. May- wheat i
opened at 70%4i 10%, and on liquidation got j
down to 70% c. At this point, however, the crop !
news received from correspondents of commis
sion houses became worse and more positive
about the Injury done than has previously been
the case. California dispatches said the rain
had been inadequate and the conditions of the
winter wheat was still very poor. Shorts in the
meantime had covered freely. The market be
came very strong in the last hour. California
sent further dry weather dispatches and frost
damage reports were as numerous as the war
time complaints about canned roast beef. The
heavy purchases for export also stimulated the
demand. May closed at" 71% c, an advance of
I%C. . .:
The strength in corn was due apparently to j
continued confidence in the short crop theories
of the bulls. May left off %c higher.
Oats ruled firm in sympathy with wheat and
corn. May closed %c higher.-';- :
The notable feature of the provision market |
was the weakness of pork, while lard and ribs
were firm. A good many speculators had \
spreads between pork and other speculative j
commodities, and to the uncovering of some
of these spreads was ascribed the irregularity
of the market. Pork left off 7%c lower, and
lard and ribs i unchanged.

A BOOT AND SHOE TRUST.
NEW YORK, March 9.â A special dispatch
from Boston to the Commercial Advertiser
says: The shoe and leather men of this city
and the shoe towns of the State are greatly
interested in a proposition that has been made
to form a national boot and shoe trust. It .ap
pears that the matter was broached to manu
facturers by Smith & Ryan of Chicago. A
small meeting was held, but no action was
taken. The meeting adjourned with the idea
that the trade should be canvassed and the re
sult be reported at a later meeting-. There
seems to be a decided difference of opinion.
The largest manufacturers generally throw
cold water on what they call feeble attempts to
form a combination. The project for an upper
leather trust is being actively pushed. The
movement is already considered a success, al
though the promoters have not gone quite far
enough to make the announcement of details.
LONDON WOOL SALES.
LONDON, March 9.â At the wool auction

of scoured was keenly competed for at occa
sionally 5 per cent higher. A large selection of
fine crossbreds ruled firm and received strong
home support. Punta Arenas wool sold well at
from. 5 to 7% per cent above the November fig
ures. There was a full attendance and the de
mand was active.

FARE M*CRACKER TRUST IS
ALMOST A REALITY
All Pacific Coast Plants Will Be Absorbed by
a Big Eastern Syndicate With Large
Capitalization.'
Competition in the Industry West of the Rockies a Thing
. of the Past â Individual Factories to Lose
Their Identity.
Slowly but surely is the commercial â¢
Sphere being lined by iron-clad trusts. ;
The latest to enter the field is the great '
cracker syndicate which, despite the de- i
nials of the proprietors and the managers â 
of Pacific Coast cracker companies, is
now being organized and will be con
summated within the next few days. It
will be a Pacific Coast syndicate, with
the capital furnished by New "fork finan
ciers, and its aim is to end or all time
competition in cracker manufacturing on
this coast. ,
The formation of the cracker trust has j
been in process for several months, but
not until a few days ago had . affairs
reached such a state as to assure its con
summation. Within a week the cracker
plants in San Francisco and in all other
large cities of the coast .-.ill pass out of
the hands of their present owners and
become the property of the syndicate
which will be known as the Pacific Coast
Cracker Company. From Pufi Sound
to the Gulf of California the cracker in
dustry will then be in the hands of the
syndicate.
How well the plans for the formation
of this trust have been and are being
guarded is evinced by the denials of all
coast cracker company managers. Man
ager Dunn of the America Biscuit Com
pany, the largest cracker manufactory
on the Pacific Coast, .asserts in positive
terms that no such thin as a Pacific
Coast cracker trust exists or is in pro
cess of formation. "Surely if such a com
bination was a fact I would know of it."
he said. Wheu asked whether there was
any strong likelihood of an immediate
consolidation under tie control of a large
Eastern syndicate, Mr. Dunn became non
committal, saying evasively that the ten
dency of the times as toward trusts.
That was all he would admit.
The proprietors of the Standard Cracker
Company exhibited the sane disinclina
tion to say anything, and although they
must know that everything is in readi
ness for the finishing touches on this
.great corporate structure, they stanchly
deny any such knowledge.
R. C. Pell, the manager of the Portland
Cracker Company in this city, also pre
tends utter ignorance of any trust
scheme.
The capital of the syndicate will be be
tween $3,000,000 and $10,000,000. The plants
which the syndicate will absorb will be |
bought outright and the purchase price
paid In a lump sum. The factories in'
this city that will lose their identity as ;
independent corporations are the Ameri
can Biscuit Company, the Standard
Cracker Company, the Eclipse Cracker
Company, the Portland Cracker Com
pany, The Eagle Cracker Company and a
few plants of lesser Importance. With i
these will be joined the leading manufac- ;
tories In Spokane, Portland. Seattle, Los
Angeles. Sacramento and Siockton.
With so many plants under its control
the syndicate will be in a position to reg
ulate output and prices. As soon as trie
organization is perfected a selection will i

he made as to which of the plants will
be rated and which to close. The re
sult will be naturally to throw many men
out of employment.
The American Biscuit Company is the
property of some of the wealthiest man- ;
ufacturers on the coast. The other com- |
panics doing business In this city are also
in the hands of wealthy men. All have
been doing a profitable business. The.
general deduction is that these people
are interested in the new syndicate,
though it is certain that the great bulk
of the capital comes from the East.
When the details of organization are
made public it will be seen that* nearly
every manufactory worthy to be called
such has been drawn into the syndicate.
The new syndicate Is the outgrowth of
the war Chat for many years has been
waged anions the cracker manufacturers
of this coast, the result of which has
been poorer product? at a constantly fall
ing cost price. Now the colossal power
of the trust steps in, and with its usua;
promises to Improve the quality of the
crackers without increasing the price.
That competition in the cracker indus
try on the Pacific Coast has been given
Its death blow appears certain. Not only i
will the new trust be left alone to rid*
triumphant with its tabulated !ii?t of
prices from San Diego to Seattle, but
there Is no redress for the cracker-eating
community oil this coast if the syndicate
wishes to advance existing rates.
Some of the people who have agreed to
sell out to the syndicate claim that prices
will be lower. They base their reason
ing on the broad principle that it Is less
expensive to run a groat number of plants
when directed by a single hand than to
have each of these plants in pa rate ope- ;
ration under a distinct management.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1899.
BULLMAN IS
LAID UP FOR
REPAIRS AGAIN
Wyoming Fell With
the Jockey.
SHOULDER SEVERELY INJURED
SAN MATEO CLAIMED FROM A
SELLING RACE.
Corrigan's Sardonic Won a Bunko
Race â Suckers Are Cherry-Ripe
at Ingleside Some More
Favorites in Front.
The last number on the bill of fare at
Corrigan's track yesterday was replete
with incidents and accidents. "It 'was a
six-furlong sprint, and began with San
Mateo, the favorite, being left at the
post, the assistant starter failing to let
go of the horse's bridle. The field had
not traveled far when Wyoming, ridden
by Bullman, went down in a heap. As
the stretch was reached, Pat Murphy was
pulled up, bleeding like a stuck hog.
Without further incident, Tammany Hall
II then beat Orion out two lengths for
the purse. As a climax to the whole
thing, G. "W. Scott, owner of Lady Bri
tannic, a starter in the race, placed a
claim with the secretary for San Mated
and took the sprinter. The horse raced
in the colors of Miller & Blazer, but was
owned by Walter Hobart. Adding first
money of the purse s 325 â to his entered
selling priceâ ssooâ Mr. Scot! secured a
very cheap piece of racing material.
Jockey Bullman was picked up and car
ried to the paddock, where it afterward
transpired the lucky rider received no
more serious injury than a broken small
bone In the shoulder.
Favorites displayed rare form by cap
turing four purses. The fields, as usual,
were small in the majority of Instances.
The third event, a mile and a lurking
selling run, was a gold brick deal, pure
and simple, and a lilting illustration of
what people are asked to play against at
the track. The race was "an extra," the
entries closing at 4 p. m. the day previous.
The Corrigan mare Sardonic, for some
reason not at the time known by all, v.. is
installed a stout favorite in the betting.
It was soon made clear. Red Glenn came
out with one leg in the stable and the
other three very shaky. Lady Hurst fol
lowed, the tears pouring from her eyes,
and propping her front underpinning, a
sufferer from rheumatism. Next came
the "crabby" Major Hooker, sporting the
colors of Corrigan's nephew, J. Carrol!,
ft proved a grand equine contest. Red
Glenn hobbled into the stretch first.
where Martin gave Sardonic her head and
she rolled in. Still San Francisco fur
nished the "suckers" and the Ingleside
management weeps because they don't
grow up fast enough.
The opening mile run resulted in a big
upset. Truxilio. with Bullman up, was
backed down to favoritism, but a poor
start ruined his chances at the outset.
He was also badly interfered with dur
ing the progress of the race. Caspar, a
40 to 1 chance, led to within a few yards
of the wire, where Johnny Reiff on To
ribio. another Outsider, came with a rush,
winning hands down. The favorite fin
ished fourth.
The second mile run proved somewhat
easy for Roadrunner. The chestnut horse,
witn Bullman In the saddle, whs a prime
favorite; finishing first with something to
spare, Glengaber sueeeeded in getting the
place, but was' disqualified. in;.- gave
second money to McFarlane and the show
to Main bar. , . , .
The fourth number, a mile selling run,
fell to Potente, the favorite. The gelding
made all the running and easing" up at
the finish led Bonnie lone out four
lengths.
The fifth purse, which no doubt through
a streak ot luck, happened to be a JpOO
one, Iso went to Cotrlgan. His gelding,
Adolph Sprecki Is, a 3 to 5 favorite, reeled
off the mile and. a furlong In 1:66 flat,
downing Meropa quite handily. First
Tenor was the only other starter.
Track Notes.
Devin, who rode Glengaber in the sec
ond race, was suspended for the balance
of the meeting, it being the opinion of
the stand that he Indulged in two much I
rough riding.
The cause of Builman's tumble looked
very much as it a door was -opened for
him and then slammed In his face.

MURDER, SUICIDE, OR
ACCIDENTAL DEATH ?
JVJystery ir\ the Asphyxiation of JA.
BvirdicU at the Commercial
Hotel.
MARCINE BURDICK, an aged dairyman from Tomales, was found
dead in his bed in the Commercial Hotel yesterday morning, hav
ing died from gas asphyxiation. Deceased registered at the house
early In the evening, and was accompanied by two roughly dressed
men, with whom he departed a few moments later. He called at a rail
road ticket office, at 4 Montgomery street, and inquired the cost of a round
trip tourist ticket to New York. Burdick stated that he was going to
visit his two sisters, whom he had not seen in many years, and would call
at 9 o'clock on the following morning and procure his transportation.
G. Tonlnl, the ticket agent, says that he advised the stranger to
leave his money In the safe or take it to the hotel, but the countryman
laughingly replied that he knew how to care for his funds and went his
way. He Is known to have spent some time in the saloons of the Barbary
Coast, but returned to the hotel about 9 o'clock, and. while somewhat In
toxicated, was able to walk upstairs. The bellboy accompanied Burdick
to his room, and, as is the custom at that place, showed him several
times how to light and extinguish the gas. The boy passed the man's
apartment twice late In the night and noticed that the light was still
burning.
When Tin bods was found yesterday morning the gas was turned on
full force, and it is the theory of the . hotel people that when Burdick
finally put out the light he unintentionally turned the gas on and lay
down to his endless she,,. The police regard the case as accidental, but
are not certain thai the man was not robbed before he returned to the
hotel. They have been unable to learn whether or not the deceased had
any considerable sum of money with him when he arrived in the city. IT
is considered possible that the victim whs robbed of all but the three
dollars found in his clothes, and realizing that he would be unable to make
the .long Intended visit to his sisters, turned on the monoxide in a fit of
drunken despondency. There is another theory that may be correct.
When the dead man's room was entered the door was found unlocked, and
it would have been easy for Some guest to enter his room, rob him and
then turn on the gas. Thus far. however, the police are not inclined to
accept this proposition.
Deceased was about 60 years old, and had been engaged in various

NOW FOR THE GREAT
CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHT
LAVIGNE AND SMITH IN PER-
FECT CONDITION
John L. Sullivan Contends That a
Referee Should Be Able to De
cide Any Twenty-Round
Contest.
The most absurd question asked yester
day by men who are Interested In the
championship contest which will be held
this evening in Woodward's Pavilion was.
"Who will win the fight?"
Any person who can answer this ques
tion correctly can easily make more
money in one day than a bank president
can earn In a year.
Neither i.avigno nor his opponent.
Smith, can say with any certainty what
the result of the great fight will be. Cer
tainly both men are confident of bagging
the long end of the sack, but notwith
standing the confidence displayed by the
young warriors one must surfer' defeat and
chagrin when the referee announces the
winner of the championship and the emol
uments that go with It.
If the contest should end In a draw
neither the public nor the contestants will

I feel satisfied. John L. Sullivan, in an In
' terview On fighting, topics, said that a
referee who had the remotest conception
of Queensberry rides should be able to
I decide .i twenty-round contest by naming
a winner.
"When two men battle for twenty
rounds,'.' said Sullivan, "the contest can
not possibly be so very close thai a win
ner cannot easily be pointed out. The
great trouble with a majority of the ref
erees of the present day Is thai they fear
: ridicule from some of the people who may
have money Invested on the result of the
decision. A referee should not give a
cuss for what the people think. Let him
decide the fight according to his best
judgment, and although lie may offend
some of the natural-born kickers he can
rest satisfied that all fair-minded sport
ing nun will always stick by him. The
great trouble Is that we are having too
many draws, and I always did contend
| that a draw light is not worth going
across the street to see."
There is a great demand for good seats,
and the outlook for a crowded house is
decidedly promising. '?;;.-:
The betting yesterday was at even
money, and It is doubtful if there will be
much change in the present order of poo!
selling until the men enter the ring.
Young Mitchell and Billy Lavigue will
second the "Kid," and Smith will be
looked after by Tim McGratb and Billy
Hennessy.

Donald, I leave nothing. My reasons for
doing so are that during the past few
years of my life he has caused me great
mental anguish and suffering; also that
during his lifetime I advanced him about
$3000 in cash."

THEN KIDNAPED
I Remarkable Story of
Josie Kerr;
i
j SENSATION IN O'BRIEN CASE
!
ANOTHER SICK JUROR CAUSES
DELAY IN THE TRIAL.
Peculiar Action of Judge Ellsworth
in Sustaining an Objection
Made to His Own Tes
timony.
â¢ â 
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
'.OS Broadway, March 9,
There was an unusual occurrence
coupled with a sensation at the trial of
James F. O'Brien, charged with felony.
In Judge Ellsworth's court to-day.
Judge Ellsworth was placed in the pecu-
Hth position of sustaining an objection to
Ins own testimony. This was brought
about by the attempt of defendant's at
torney, Frank McGowan, to prove that
one of the witnesses for the prosecution,
| Miss Jos;.- Kerr, had been illegally paid
I money to testify. The young, woman had
| stated that D. .Lopez, father of the com
i plaining witness, had given her $20 pend
! ing the trial and that afterward she re
; celved (40 from Detective 11. V. Herbert,
i representing the prosecution.
i The prosecution then showed that the
] money was paid to Miss Kerr for board
I and lodging, so that she might be kept
I close at hand as a witness.
Attorney McGowan still Insisted that
: such proceeding was illegal and that the
' court had entered no order to pay Miss
Kerr. Judge Ellsworth was accordingly
sworn as a witness, when McGowan asked
him whether any such order was of rec
ord. Attorn -;, M. C. Chapman of counsel
i for the prosecution objected to the ques
| tion on the ground that the records them
'â  selves in such cases are the best evidence.
j Judge Ellsworth hesitated a moment and
i then sustained Attorney Chapman's ob-
I jection. Court Clerk Pierce was next
sworn and testified that no such order had
! been entered.
It- was subsequently explained that it
j was proper to pay the necessary living
j expenses of a witness, where the purpose
Is to hold one in readiness, and In Miss
i Kerr's case it developed that the trial of
| O'Brien had been overtimed last Deeem
: ber on account id Detective Herbert's ' in
â  ability to locate Miss Kerr, who is an im
portant witness in the case.
When Miss Kerr was finally found a
i few weeks ago she told a remarkable
| story to Detective Herbert, the truth of
! which she substantially proved to Her
j berts satisfaction. She said that one
â  night last December, while Jn the com
] pany of one of the O'Brien boys at Pleas
! anton, she was drugged and kidnaped.
i She had been taken in a buggy and driven
to the hills at Dos Gatos. From there
, -iii went to San Jose, where she received
: a letter from one of the O'Briens advis-
Ing her to return, as the case had been
I continued, but urging her to say nothing
i about what had happened. When Miss
i Kerr returned. to Pleasanton she learned
! that Detective Herbert had been looking
| for her, and so she came to Oakland.
i Since then Detective Herbert had. on be
-1 half of tin- people, paid the young wo
i man's expenses, amounting to about $40.
i Owing to the sudden Illness of H. Haus
-1 childt. one of the Jurors, the trial early
this afternoon was continued until to
morrow morning. The case is one of the
most nauseating that has ever been tried
|In the Superior Court. O'Brien is accused
of having drugged a young woman named
Lopez ami criminally assaulted her. This
is his second trial, though on the pre
vious trial a verdict of guilty was brought
I in.

THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1899.
SNOW MAKING
A HOT RACE FOR
THE MAYORALTY
Dr* Pardee Active in
the Campaign.
REPUBLICANS ARE CONFIDENT
LAKE MERRITT PEOPLE TOO
SANGUINE.
Desperate but Ineffectual Efforts Are
Being Made to Defeat W.
A. Dow and M. K.
Miller.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 9.
The opinion expressed In this paper many
weeks ago that an organized effort was
being mad" to deliver the city government
into the hands of the people who would
run the town wide open has now become
general. Sfnce the return of Mr. Snow
from the funeral of his wife he has taken
an active part in the campaign and at the
close there is no reason to doubt the en
tire success of the Republican ticket.
During the past week Dr. Pardee, has
been active in the contest. He has ap
peared nightly in different parts of the
city and has replied very forcefully to
the statements of the opposition. During
the early part of tin campaign it was said
that Dr. Pardee would not meddle in mu
nicipal affairs, but the enforced absence,
at a critical time, of R. W. Snow, the
candidate for Mayor, made it imperative
that some one should come- forward and
take his place. Dr. Pardee jumped Into
the breach and has been doing much effi
cient work.
Mr. Snow showed by his most recent
speech that he is not truckling to the
millionaires who are, as he expresses it,
"too enthusiastic" for improvements
around Lake Merritt. Mr. Snow has been
declaring for months that the Lake Mer
ritt people wanted too much at once, and,
although his experience caused him to
warn the Council of its mistake, he was
peremptorily put down and ids statements
ignored. Now Mr. Snow is not the least
bit backward in telling these millionaires
of their haste and inexperience. He says
"the estimable gentlemen comprising the
Lake Merritt improvement Association
have gone at the Improvement of Lake
Merritt with more enthusiasm than
money. Then, too. the same enthusiastic
citizens have engineered an ordinance
through the City , Council, anticipating
$50,000 of taxes that are to be paid in next
year. If it must be held sacred, tins or
dinance alone will require a tax rate of
VI cents upon every $100 for this improve
ment. Where is the 'money to burn?' '"
A little friction has been aroused in this
connection by the failure of the Allied
Improvement clubs last night to indorse
B C Cuvellier for Councilman at large.
Mr Cuvellier voted against this $50,000
ordinance, which Mr. Snow with ins ten
years! experience says is a bad project,
It is said that for his opposition to this
measure Mr. Cuvellier was turned down
and a Democrat was favored by the club.
While there is some excuse for placing
Mi Kramm from the annexed district on
the list indorsed by the Improvement
dubs there Is none for dropping the name
of Cuvellier. for Mr. Cuvellier has made
on,- of the best and most faithful Coun
j oilmen that ever held office at the City
Hall: , . , â â 
One of the most persistent fights is be-
I ing made against city Attorney Dow. It
is an open secret that many members of
' the Police and Fire departments, con
trary to its rules, are supporting Mr.
Dow's opponent. Every possible influ
' enci savoring of the racetrack or gam
bling interests is being trained against
Mr. Dow. and the contest Is one- of Re
publicanism and decency against the field.
The most ridiculous opposition of any is
that against M. K. Miller. Mr. Miller has
shown' what he can do during his four
years as Superintendent of Streets, and
! everybody who uses the streets favors
j his election as City Engineer. But those
i who persistently occupy, the sidewalks
! and curbstones are opposed to him. There
iis however, no reason at this time to
! fear the defeat of the Republican can
j didates.
JUROR SIEBEN'S
INDISPOSITION
CAUSES ALARM
Brandes Murder Trial
Again Delayed.
UNDER A PHYSICIAN'S CARE
LONG TRIAL LEAVES ITS MARK
ON THE ACCUSED.
Fear That Sieben's Sickness May
Defeat the Ends of Justice,
for the Time Being at
Least. .
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 9.
Considerable alarm is manifested over
the illness of Philip Sieben, one of the
jurors in the Brandes murder trial. The
case has dragged along for an entire
month and has already cost the county
approximately $10,000 and the end is not
yet In sight. In fact. Juror Sleben's sick
ness has created a remote fear that for
the present, at least, the ends of justice
may be defeated.
Court adjourned early yesterday after
noon on account of , the juror's illness, and
when the case was called this morning
Mr. Sieben was not present. According to
his physician. Dr. E. M. Keyes, there Is
very much doubt as to whether his health
will permit him to continue to act in the
capacity In which be has shown such a
deep interest. Should his illness prove
fatal It would necessitate a complete new
trial.
Mr. Sieben is suffering from nervous
prostration together with other compli
cations which, for one of his age, make
his condition serious. Other jurors, too,
are beginning to show the effects of the
strain and several have complained of
slight illness.
Even on the accused the protracted trial
has left its marks. Brandes is no longer
the hearty, robust fellow he appeared on
the day he was arraigned. His cheeks are
sallow, dark rings circle his eyes, and
furrows have made their way across his
forehead. He seems in constant despair
and torture, and at times has the ap
pearance of one who little cares whether
his end shall come on the gallows or
otherwise.
Provided Juror Sieben is well enough
the trial will be resumed next Tuesday
morning. ; _____
SAYS HIS MARRIAGE IS
A HORRIBLE NIGHTMARE
GEORGE SHANE WEDDED WHILE
IN A TRANCE.
The Young Man Finds Nothing Ro
mantic in His Alliance With
Lulu Homeier.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
. 1428 Park street. March 9.
George C. Shane, whose secret marriage
to Miss Lulu Homeler was made public a
few days ago, looks upon the affair as
nothing more or less than a very serious
joke. He says he was in an alcoholic
trance at the time the ceremony was per
formed and claims he knew nothing ot
being transformed from a bachelor into
a Benedick until he regained his senses
the day after the wedding.
The young man's story robs Miss Ho
meler of any happiness she found In her
romantic plunge Into matrimony, and the
denouement of the affair as stated by her
Is far from the picture of love's trials and
triumphs she would have the. public be
lieve.
"Although our marriage took place In
October, 1897, 1 have never lived with the
woman who claims to be my wife, and
as far as I am concerned never will,"
said Mr. Shane to-day with much em
phasis. "I have never acknowledged
Miss Homeler as my wife. I would never
have breathed a word concerning the un
pleasant affair if she had not told her
story "to the newspapers In an effort to
force me to support her. As she has put
the thing as a beautiful romance, ending
in happiness, I will say for my part that
it is a horrible nightmare, with nothing
but pain and remorse.
"As near as I remember the occurrences
on the wedding day, a crowd of young
folks from Alameda, among whom were
Miss Homeler and myself, were taking in
the sights In San Francisco. A French
dinner was part of the programme. Some
one of the party suggested that it would
be a huge joke- for us to get married. I
drank more wine than was good for me
and do not recollect what followed. In
fact, the balance of the day was a blank.
I do not know what became of the rest
Of the party. A short time later Miss
Homeler informed me that we had beep.
married at San Rafael and proved her as
sertions by producing a marriage certifi
cate. I have never seen her since and
have no desire to meet her."
Miss Homeler is the daughter of Louis
Homeler, formerly director of the Bald
win Theater orchestra, and was a popular
belle among the younger set of this city.
The announcement of her secret marriage
was a surprise to her friends, and the
statements of her husband will no doubt
create a sensation.
Shane is a son of a former real estate
dealer of Alameda who died some time
ago. â
SANTA CLARA WINS.

BERKELEY, March 9.â The second .
I baseball game of the season between j
j Berkeley University and Santa Clara Col-
I lege was played on the university cam
pus this afternoon. The boys from Santa |
i Clara again showed surprising form, I
; clearly outclassing their opponents and
I winning by a score of 9 to 1.
While Berkeley has made much prog
ress under the direction of Joe Corbett, tne
! team is yet lamentably weak at the bat.
i The Santa Clara boys not only fielded
well, but batted in a splendid manner,
clearly showing the benefit of the coach- i
ing they have received at the hands of j
Jay Hughes, the great Baltimore twirier. !
The features of the game were the ex- !
cellent infield work of the Santa Claras,

HEIRS TAKE A HAND.
Another Contest Promised for Pos
session of Mary F. Haw
ley's Estate.
OAKLAND. March There promises
to be another lively contest over the estate
of Mary F. Hawley, who is supposed to
have committed suicide in September. 1897.
It was expected that, when the alleged
will which was filed by Special Adminis
trator Hawkett, was declared bogus by
Judge Hall about a week ago. the hus
band, Wiliam E. Hawley, would petition
for letters of administration. Hawley,
however, has disappeared and apparently
takes no further interest In the estate.
which consists of real estate In Napa and
Alameda counties valued between $20,000
and $23,000. This apparent indifference has
caused other heirs to act, for on last Sat
urday Sarah H. Edgington. a sister of de
ceased, applied for letters on behalf of
Hallie O. Edging-ton, another sister, of
whom she is the guardian. And to-day
B. C. Hawes, the Public Administrator,
also applied for letters, while late in the
day still another petition was tiled by
Nettie F. Pickett, another sister of de
ceased. The matter will be heard before
Judge Hall on .March 20.
Ferdinand Hokum to-day petitioned the
Superior Court for letters of administra
tion on the estate of his wife. Carrie Hol
tum. who died intestate on the 4th inst.
The estate consists of a $1300 life insur
ance policy, and the heirs are petitioner

CRIMINAL PLOT OF
RACING GAMBLERS
They Complete Their Scheme
to Protect Ingleside's
Corruption.
The Supervisors Are on Guard â All
Classes Are Joined in the
Struggle to Destroy the.
Evil.
The gamblers of Ingleside have now I
completed the details of the campaign ,
in which they hope to save themselves
and the ill-gotten profits of the race- |
course from the legislative prohibition
of the Supervisors. The jockeys, touts, I
manipulators and sure-thing men of the
racecourse are up in arms, and they |
make no secret of their promise to u.se
some money to gain their ends and the |
privilege of preying upon San Francisco
and its people. The men that have the
affairs of the racetrack in hand an- j
nounce that they will spend cpin to pre
vent the final adoption of the resolution
that was passed to print last Monday j
by the Supervisors. This announce- j
ment is a direct insult to the officials ',
who have so far remembered their i
pledges and have so acted as honest j
officers of the municipal government â¢
as to enact a law that means so much |
to th*- healthy life of the community. |
In reply the gamblers declare that they
will attempt to bribe the Supervisors j
to retire in disgrace from the position j
they have taken.
This proposed attempt has been so |
openly and shamelessly declared that !
every gossip on the street knows it,
and the Supervisors have naturally :
been made aware of it. In answer they
declare that neither money nor the ex- |
ercise of influence, dishonestly used, can
induce them to waver in the stand they
have taken. As one member of the
board said yesterday: "We have the
press, the pulpit, the commercial and
mercantile communities behind us in j
our crusade against the crime-creating
nest of the racecourse. We took our
initial action after due deliberation. We
knew that merchants and business men !
were begging for legislative action that
would protect them and save their
employes from the consequences of j
temptation at the racecourse. The aid j
of the police and of every well-meaning
element in the community had been in- i
yoked in vain, and we stepped in to
supply the remedy that so man: bought |
and none but ourselves could find. I
"We know that a cry is being raised ';
in behalf of honest sport, so called. !
This cry is a dishonest one, and we I
thoroughly understand it as such. The
game that is conducted at Ingleside is |
neither sport nor honest. In abolish-
Ing this game we are not militating
against honest sport of any kind. We
are simply striving to save the young
men of the city from the offenses that
lead to disgrace and death and the
young women from the temptations
that end in dishonor.
"In such a crusade we cannot afford
to temporize with so grave an evil. It
must be killed, and we are glad that the
LABOR'S UNITED SONS
OPPOSE THE TRACK
Labor's forces, the brawn and muscle of the city, as represented by the
Building Trades' Council, stand opposed to the notorious .adjunct of the
racetrack, the bookmaker's stand, and^its close and deadly ally, the pool
room of the city.
The racetrack is something essentially foreign to a body which simply
deals with labor matters, but things have come to such a pass" that the
racetrack has forced itself upon the attention of the workingmen of this
city. Under the regular order of business laid down by its constitution
and by-laws the Building Trades Council could take no definite action on
this matter, but like all other organizations it sets apart a portion of
the evening when subjects of common interest may be discussed, and it
was under this head that the track received a blow from the workingmen
last night.
The regular routine business was transacted as usual. Then came a
lull. President P. H. McCarthy rapped sharply with his gavel and said:
"Brothers, we are now under th" head of 'good of the order.' As your
president it hardly becomes me to occupy the floor, but there is a subject
to which I would like to call your attention and on which I think the
members of this body might well express their individual opinion for
the benefit of the public. In the picturesque outskirts of this city there
is a crime-breeding spot; a putrefying sore which contaminates all who
touch it. It is known as the Ingleside racetrack. You know its history; I
know it. There is a trail of blood leading to it. The hills are white with
gravestones, the prisons full of felons.
"Look for the cause. The records of the criminal courts show that
many men wearing stripes to-day started on their downward journey at
the racetracks. The mortuary records show that scores of suicides ended
their lives to hide their disgraceâ a disgrace caused by a monomaniac
desire to beat the races.
"The Board of Supervisors at its last session passed to print a resolu
tion which, if finally adopted, will pu a stop to this evil. Brothers, I' think
it but right that we express our honest opinion on this matter. 1 know of
no rule which permits us to bring this matter to a final vote, but I think
that, as citizens, we should express our commendation of the ten men who
have already done their best to suppress this evil. Let us thank them for
what they have already done, and hope they will clinch the nail already
driven In."
William M. Page, the time-honored secretary of the council, was the
next speaker. He is a man of few words, honest and open-hearted.
"Brothers," he said, "1 am glad that our president has called this matter
to our attention. Like him, 1 have read the long record of crime and death
which can be traced directly to Ingleside. We, as individuals, can do lit
tle to suppress this evil; but the men who have already voted on the
question, the ten honorable members of the Board of Supervisors, are the
choice of the majority of the citizens. In this matter, at least, the cho
sen ones have done well. I personally thank them, and hope that at the
next meeting they will make the resolution killing the vice-breeding gam
bling a law. This Is something for every workingman to think about
and study carefully."
Walter Grofl of Carpenters' Union 453 followed Mr. Page on the same
lines. He compared the racetrack and its brother, the downtown pool
room, to the viper which lurks in a tempting spot and venomously strikes
the wearied sojourner who halts there for a moment's r__t.
James W. Rose had another idea and one which struck home. "We
are always raising the cry," he said, "that money is scarce. Outsiders
are taking it away. Who are these outsiders? DO not the sycophants of the
track take away our dimes, our quarters and our dollars day after day,
without a voice being raised against the practice? The Supervisors are
right. Let the races run,, and if I want to go out let me have the privi
lege of doing so, but keep the commissoned bookmaker and poolseller far
away from me." ;
Other speeches having the same general trend were made by C. Hussey,
E. J. Brandon. C. W. Stark, George Oakes, George Lee, H. J. Skeehan
and others. Many .interesting and hitherto unthought of points were
brought out. but one and all looked at the bookmaker and the poolseller
as evils which should at once be suppressed.
people of the city understand, as we do, j
, the seriousness of the situation. We
have taken our stand in the matter, and |
our next vote will simply be the regis- |
ter, of our first determination. As we
took our stand only after due delibera
tion, there is nothing in the nature of
a just argument that can induce us to
retreat from our position and with the
plea of legalizing and restricting a
'sport' permit a pernicious scheme of
1 debauchery to thrive In San Francisco."
The foregoing Is the opinion of one
of the members of the Board of Super
visors, It is of significant and timely
Interest, because of the fact that the
masters of Ingleside have determined
to carry out a crafty campaign to pre
serve the crime-breeding influences
of the racecourse. As the plan is now
outlined three men will appear before
the Supervisors next Monday to plead
against the final adoption of the pro
hibitory ordinance. These men will be
Henry Crocker, Walter Hobart and ex-
Senator Androus.
They will ask the Supervisors to de
lay final action until representatives of
the racecourse may be heard. Any al
ternative except the complete prohibi
tion of gambling will be accepted. The L
racetrack cannot exist as a sport in it
self. It needs the savings of honest men
and the thefts of thieves with which
to reward the gambling blacklegs of
other communities that flock to San
Francisco.
The Supervisors will be asked to re- j
fer the resolution, which has been
passed to print, to a committee, that of
Health and Police, over which an In- i
teresting gentleman presides. The plea
for such action will be that representa
tives of the racecourse may then state
their case. It is an old game that
sometimes works with success. After
the resolution, which under the ordin
ary process of law would become opera
tive next Monday, has been referred to â¢
a committee the people of the city may
abandon any hope of relief.
Messrs. Hobart, Crocker and Androus
! will represent the property interests of
| Ingleside. Many thousands of dollars i
have been invested at the local race
j course. The pleaders before the Super
visors will ask for justice as they un
derstand the meaning of the term.
When this plea is made, however, the
Supervisors will remember what has j
been done by the local Merchants' As
sociation, of which Mr. Crocker is an
honored member.
This association has done everything '
in its power to destroy the gambling;
evil which the race course has bred in |
San Francisco. The association, j
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MARCH 10, 1899.
WAS NOT A PARTY
TO BEEF SCANDAL
i Ex-Secretary Morton Disproves Allega
| tions of Enemies.
IX the dispatches from Washington yesterday regarding the scandal over
the beef supplied American soldiers in Cuba ah effort was made to con
nect ex-Secretary of Agriculture Morton with the horse-slaughtering in
dustry. Happily, Mr. Morton is In this city at present, and was glad to
avail himself of the opportunity afforded him to refute the allegations/ In
an Interview he demonstrated that the Information given out at Washington
was not accurate and that an Injustice had been done him. He said:
"The horsemeal packing plant at Hoboken mentioned In the dispatches
was established and stamps of inspection awarded Its output under the Har
rison administration by Jerry Rusk, Secretary of Agriculture. The product of
this equine pickling establishment was branded 'sweet pickled beef,' and
that, too, for exportation to Belgium and other countries of Europe where
the manufacture of bologna sausages is extensively carried on.
"When the second administration of Cleveland began early in March 1593,
this bogus beef business was brought accidentally to my attention. I imme
diately took the ground that the laws of the United States. providing for the
inspection and certification of meats for interstate and foreign trade were
operative only upon edible meats, or meats which the American people held
to be edible. I then withdrew inspection and stamps from the Knackers oi
Hoboken and elsewhere, declaring that the Department of Agriculture court
certify, the flesh of dogs, cats or rats with the same propriety that it could
stamp horse meat inspected and wholesome.' .
"The attempt now evident in some quarters to shoulder, the Imperfections
of meat inspection and the service of the Bureau of Animal Industry upon
me may result in a more general publicity for the methods, management
and disbursements of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and In fact of the whole
Department of Agriculture. The American taxpayers, and especially the
farmers, cannot know too much about the policies, methods and expenditures
of this department. I will rejoice In the complete, detailed and precise publi
cation of all of my official acts bearing upon either the microscopic or other
meat inspection. I desire, however, meantime, to have it distinctly under
stood everywhere that 1 did not Institute but did abolish the Inspection of
horsemeat by the Department of Agriculture, and furthermore I put Inspect
ors Into the classified service and required as a condition precedent to their
examination that all applicants for inspectorships and assistant Inspector
ships should be graduates from, reputable veterinary colleges.
"Before my term of office these meal Inspectors were made up. as a rule,
from the ranks of heelers, bummers and workers in political parties. The
ante-mortem or post-mortem Inspection of a carcass to determine Its fitness
for human food when made, as it generally was. under the spoils system, by
a ward boss or. a precinct politician, was a wicked waste of money and a
farce Horsemeat inspection, the records will show, was abolished by me."
| through its officers, and by deliberate
official action, has denounced the book
j making, poolselling evil as demoraliz
; ing to the whole community and cor-
I rupting to clerks and employes el
! business men and merchants. The as
sociation, controlling property owners
and possessing their unqualified sup
port, has placed a boycott of wealth
upon poolsellers and bookmakers, forc
ing them, with the might of law, to va
cate premises they occupied as nests
of crime.
The association has consulted with
the police in an effort to destroy the
terrible evil that has its source and
maintenance at the race course. When
the Merchants' Association discovered
thai, the police were powerless tO kill
the evil the directors, all merchants of
standing, appointed one of their num
ber to make it his exclusive business
to wipe out the gambling dens that
thrive and have their being in Ingle
side. Special attorneys were employed
at the expense of the Merchants' Asso
ciation to assist the municipal authori
ties in punishing offenders.
The Merchants' Association did more
than this. Recognizing the far reach
ing effects of the evil that has brought
crime and disgrace, desolation and
death to so many people in San Fran
cisco, the directors of the Merchants'
Association secured the Introduction of
a prohibitory bill before the Legislature
at its present session. The official news
paper of the . Merchants' Association,
known as the Merchants' Association
Review, declares that horse gambling
and its attendant evils had reached
such a pass that it has become an ab
solute necessity to San Francisco to
secure a legislative prohibition.
In this bill the Merchants' Associa
tion would have placed an absolute
ban not only upon bookmaking and
poolselling upon horse races, but upon
all contests of whatever sort in which
men or animals engage. The measure
was far more sweeping in its provi
sions than that which the Board of
Supervisors have passed to print. But
the Legislature in the exercise of its
inscrutable judgment saw fit to defeat
the bill, and the Merchants' Associa
tion, and all that it represents in this
city, is now forced to fall back upon
the Board of Supervisors for redress
and relief. The Supervisors will, with
out question, remember this fact when
Mr. Crocker and his associates appear
before the board next Monday after
noon. It will not be forgotten that an
organization, representing the wealth
and the morality of this city, has
fought for nearly a year in vain to
kill an evil which the Supervisors with
a single vote may destroy. \_;
Messrs. Crocker, Hobart and An

other than an honorable motive in
their pleading. They will present jus
tice as they see it. The other part of
the campaign will be conducted by the
carpet-bag gamblers, thieves and
blacklegs who make the race course
their rendezvous In the day time and
the city their field at night.
These men declare that they can
bribe the authorities for Immunity
from Interference. It was openly
boasted on the streets yesterday that
Chris Buckley had been employed to
act as middle man in the campaign
and to offer or accept terms. The
gamblers know of only one weapon to
use, and that is the coin that was
niched to fill their coffers. It is be
lieved, however, that the Board of Su
pervisors, which has acted so cour
ageously thus far, will continue to the
end in its crusade for the destruction
of a terrible evil. Members of the
board, as a matter of course,* have
heard of the rumors of the street.
They know of the influences" against
them and of those in their favor. A
stand has been taken and a majority
of the members declare that it' will be
maintained. .
MARIN COUNTY HAS
JOINED THE CRUSADE
People of Sausalito Ask Their Officers
to Follow This City's
Lead.
SAN RAFAEL, March 9.â Taking
their cue from the action of the Board
of Supervisors of San Francisco County
in adopting an ordinance virtually
crippling the revenues of the Ingleside
racetrack the citizens of Marin County
will make a fresh endeavor to rid them
selves of the poolrooms at Sausalito.
Various legal devices have been tried
to accomplish this object and rid the
county of an eyesore, but they have all
failed. The last attempt was that of a
citizen named H. H. Noble, who tried
to have the courts pronounce the pool
rooms a nuisance because their pres
ence injures the property interests of
Sausalito and the county generally and
because the youth of the community
are corrupted by their association with
a motley horde of gamblers and race
track touts.
. From many residents of. the "hill sec
tion" of Sausalito and other citizens of
the county have come petitions to Dis
trict Attorney Mclsaac to formulate an
ordinance similar to the one adopted in
San Francisco and present it to the
Board of Supervisors for their adoption.
It is believed in this way the evil can
be throttled. Of the temper of the
Supervisors there can be no question.
All have given evidence of their ani
mosity to the poolrooms at Sausalito
in numerous instances. It is stated that
District Attorney Mclsaac, in deference
to the. wishes of his constituents, will
formulate such an ordinance and pre
sent it to the board.
CUTTERS OF
MARBLE OUT
ON A STRIKE
Object to Reduction of
Wages.
ONE HUNDRED MEN INVOLVED
STRIKERS SAY EMPLOYERS
BROKE AN AGREEMENT.
Two Largest Yards in the City Af
fected Trouble Laid at the
Door of the Vermont
Marble Company.
About one hundred members of the Mar
ble Polishers' and Finishers* Union, em- j
ployed in various yards in this city, have
quit work sooner than submit to the piece :
work system, which would mean a reduc- ;
tion of "about 25 per cent in their wages.
The difficulties between the employers |
and employes in this business are of long
standing. The marble workers of this
city have long been forced to light against
unequal odds.
In Vermont the finishing work is done
by women and children. In other States.
notably Ohio and Tennessee, convict la
in, is 'employed. Here In San Francisco
fair wages have been paid. Workmen
have been earning from $250 to $350 per j
day, according to th class of work on
which they were employed. _
The employers have found it difficult to
keep up this scale of wage, as they have
been forced to contend with child arid con
v-i, labor. One large contract after an
other has been sent East, and a confer
ence between employers and employes I
was final v held. , . ,___ !
An agreement was entered into between ;
the employes and the firms of Run.no &
Blanch! and the Vermont Marble Com- I
pany. According to the terms of this ,
understanding the two firms were to em- ,
ploy union men at ion wages until May
1 next, and the union In j -turn was to see
that all large jobs ware kept in his city.
According to the statement made bj the
strikers the union kepi to its agreement.
Several large jobs, including the wells-
Fargo building, the Hearst building and j
the Railroad Hospital, svere saved to (all
fornia: The employers however, were
dissatisfied, and about a week ago gave
the men their choice of working by the
piece or quitting altogether. The latter
course was chosen by the men,<and yes- j
terday at noon the workmen of both con- |
corns quit work. ; . i
At Ruffino & Bianchl s business was :
entirely suspended, but the Vermont
Marble Works secured some men to take i
in hand the most pressing work. Neither
of the firms has any large contracts on
hand at present. The Vermont Marble
Company has just about completed the |
Crocker "vault In Cypress Lawn Cemetery,!
and a guard has been stationed around it,
lest it be "destroyed by the strikers." The
men who are out laugh at this precau
tion and characterize it as a "raw bluff '
by the company?
The strikers Mann- the whole trouble on
the Vermont Marble Company, and claim
that Ruffino & Bianchl were drawn into
it by agents of this concern.
The Building Trades Council last night
tendered Its moral support to the strikers.
A meeting will be held to-night in the
rooms of the Marble Cutters and a regular
strike committee appointed.
This is the second strike the marble
cutters have had during the past year.
The last trouble was with the Vermont
Marble Company, but that firm made Its
peace with the union In order that it
might secure a large contract.
Mclaughlin didn't pay.
Suit Brought Against the Major to
Recover on a Promissory Note.
Major Frank McLaughlin was yesterday
made defendant in a suit instituted by
J. A. Lawrence, who claims the politician
is indebted to him in the sum of $1123 30,
due on a promissory note executed January
19, 1898, and payable one year after date,
with interest at 5 per cent. According to
the complaint, the major promised to pay
at the First National Bank on the day the
. not became due. but he failed to keep his
promise. O'Brien, O'Brien & O'Brien rep
resent the plaintiff in the action.
LADIES' NIGHT AT THE OLYMPIC
FURNISHES MUCH EXCITEMENT
A Large Number of Fair Admirers See Their
Hosts Defeated at Baseball and
Water Polo.
It was ladies' night at the Olympic Club last evening and every person present got brimful of pleasure and excite
ment. Generally upon occasions when the club throws open its hospitable portals to the fair sex large numbers avail them
selves of the privilege. Last evening proved no exception to the rule in this respect and the. many swell gowns worn by
the guests added to the attractiveness of the scene. The only cloud that marred the pleasure of the members
of the Olympic Club was the fact that they received a couple of black eyes in both athletic events which were given for
the benefit of their guests.
The first number on the programme was a game of indoor baseball between the Olympics and Reliance team of OaJ|a
land, in which the latter was victorious to the tune of 10 to 4. The Olympics started out with a confident rush as if they
were sure winners. They were the heavier and appeared to be in better condition, but about the fifth inning they ac
quired a bad case of "rattles" and their game became exceedingly yellow. Although they were defeated the utmost goo 4
nature prevailed and both teams combined after the game to mob the umpires. Messrs. Ryder and Coffroth.
The two teams lined up as follows: Olympicsâ James, Morton, Monahan, Lalne, Kreling, Cosgrove, Follansbee, Han
rahan and Denham. '::
Relianceâ Gross, Moskiman, White, Resenheim, Holmes, Dieckmann, Dean, Audlffred and Piatt.
The water polo game followed. The Lurlines were the contenders with the Olympics and they won by a score of 3 to
2 after a hard-fought game. In the first half the Lurlines proved to be the faster swimmers and had no trouble In put
ting the ball over the goal, but before the half was up they showed signs of weakening and in the second hat tnev _naa
all they could do to keep the Olympics from pulling victory out of defeat. Had there been ten more minutes or pi..> i arc.
is hardly any doubt that the Lurline boys would have been defeated. The playing was fast and at times -â¢*^â¢ b "
tendency upon the part of some of the players on both sides to rough it. This resulted in some bruises ana an -
duckings, but it afforded lots of sport to the spectators. , . t ___. K .. n ._â._,., V*K

were dressed.
Caldron told the police that he knew the
i man who cut him and promised to swear
: out a warrant for his arrest yesterday,
â  but he failed to do so. Detective Bgan
was detailed on the case by Captain Bo
hen, and he will endeavor to get Caldron
to carry out his promise.
Policemen Joy and Wilson last night

which he used on Caldron.
