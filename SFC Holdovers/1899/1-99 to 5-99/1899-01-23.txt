The ferry steamer Oakland and the |
gasoline launch William D were in
collision yesterday morning. The
launch was sunk and Frank E. Orr
and J. Otis Wattles -were drowned,
while Charles E. Finn, J. Mathews
and Chres Gustafson had a miracu- j
lous escape for their lives.
The party in the launch were on j
their -vay to search for the bodies
of William Seabury and Edward J. j
Finn, as they had heard that the skiff
in which the young duck-hunters left ,
Berkeley had been found -ottom. up. I
TRAGEDY followed tragedy on
the hay yesterday. Friday
morning two lads, named Will
iam I bury and Edward J.
Finn, started out In a small ,
boat from Bath Beach, West Berkeley,
on a duck-hunting expedition. They ,
were to have returned Friday night,
and when they failed to do so their
relatives pot anxious. Saturday passed
â  and still there was no trace of the
young hunters, so yesterday morning
a party from Berkeley crossed the bay j
and secured Henry Peterson's gasoline
launch William D to search for the
missing boys.
The William D was in charge of Cap
tain Cbres Gust&fson, a licensed officer,
and the party with him was composed
of Frank E. Orr, a clerk with Monte
lpagre & Co.; Charles C. Finn of the
John Finn Metal Works; J. Otis Wat
tles, a student at the Berkeley Univer
'. sity and son of William S. Wattles.
' stock broker, 307 Montgomery street, j
.and Joseph Mathews, formerly chief
"..engineer of the steamship Rio de Janei- j
â¢ ro, but now with Captain Metcalf in i
' Lloyds' agency.
Mathews makes his home with the
â â¢Seaburys, Finn is a brother of the miss
ing boy and the others were personal !
friends of the two families. News
reached them just before they boarded i
/â¢the launch that the boat in which the
.. boys had set out Friday morning had
been picked up bottom up. and that
there was no trace of either young Sea
bury or Finn. They decided to go on.
. however, and search the shore line from
Bath Beach, West Berkeley, to Point
Richmond, and in order to thoroughly
examine every cove and creek they
' took along, In tow of the William D. !
'â . one of Peterson's Whitehall boats.
The William D left the Folsom-street I
float at 8 a. m. and was headed for the
north end of Goat Island. The Oakland. j
â¢ in command of Captain William Clair- !
yillf>, left the ferry slips at 8 a. m. and
headed for Oakland. There was a light
haze on the water, but otherwise it was
clear and all the parties concerned say
that Goat Island was clearly visible.
â  The launch was quickest away and j
passed the Coast Survey steamship i
McArthur, which was at anchor in the
stream, two minutes ahead of the Oak- ;
..land. The ferry-boat gradually cut
..down the launch's lead, and, overtaking I
her just as she crossed, the Oakland â¢
struck her on the port quarter and cap- j
sized her.
Orr was sitting in the cabin of the
' William D reading the morning papers
.and Wattles had Joined him a few mm"
-" utes before the collision took place.
Finn and Mathews were on deck at the
. time and Gustafson was in the pilot- j
house steering. The latter knew noth- i
ing about the threatened danger until
the launch was struck, and Captain
Clairville says he did not see the Will- i
iam D until he looked down out of the j
pilot-house window, and then she was j
under his starboard bow. He blew the j
-danger signal and reversed the ferry
. boat's engine?, but it was too late to I
prevent the collision.
Just before the collision young "Finn
.ran aft on the launch and called down
'into the cabin: "You'd better come on i
deck, boys; the Oakland is running us !
down." The words were hardly out of
.his mouth when the collision took place.
Finn jumped from the William I) into
the Whitehall boat and then overboard.
" Mathews jumped clear of the launch I
and swam away. A few minutes later j
Orr and Wattles floated out of the \
cabin, while Gustafson made his way j
out of the pilothouse window. Both Orr i
.and Wattles seemed to be Injured. The i
former made only a feeble effort to
save himself, while Wattles did not
seem to be able to swim.
By this time the steam launch from
the McArthur had arrived on the scene
The San Francisco Call.
and a boat had been lowered from the
nakland. Mathews and Finn went to
the assistance of Orr, and Gustafson
started after Wattles, who was floating
away. "Come back," yelled the sail
in the boat. "Come back and get
aboard," but Gustafson only yelled
back, "I know what I'm about. Save
the nther fellows." With powerful
strokes he made his way to the drown
ing man, and had just put out his hand
to grab him when he went down for the
last time. Gustafson swam around for
j a few minutes, but, seeing no sign of
i Wattles coming up again, he swam
j back and was taken aboard the Mc-
Arthur's launch.
Orr and Finn were already in the
; launch, while Mathews had been taken
j aboard the Oakland. Orr was in a very
j precarious condition, and Finn was
j more dead than alive, so the launch was
i headed at full speed for Mission street
j wharf. On reaching there Gustafson
; ran to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
: and told the driver of the ambulance
:of the accident. Drs. Fitzgibbon and
, Sweeney were in bed, but at once got
up, and Dr. Fitzgibbon started out In
! his bare feet, but was stopped. When
Orr was brought in the doctors were
sure he was dead, but nevertheless they
went to work on his body and every
thing known to medical science was
done tn resuscitate him, but without
avail. The right side of the dead man's
head was bruised and his hair and
clothes were all greasy, evidently from
the gasoline that had washed back
from the engine room into the cabin.
Finn was undressed and put to bed.
He was then given a stimulant and
about 11 a. m. was able to dress him
self and go home.
Contradictory stories are told about
the collision. The people who were on
the William D state positively that the
"akland ran them down. The captain
and mate of the ferry-boat say the Wil
liam D ran into them.
"I was called to the telephone last
Saturday and asked if I could spare a
launch fnr Sunday morning," said
Henry Peterson yesterday. "The mes
sage came from Captain Seaburys
house in Berkeley, and I agreed to
have the William D ready for them at
â¢'clock Sunday morning. At the
hour named four men put in an appear
ance and said they wanted to go to
Pinole to search for two young fellows
who had gone duck hunting and had
not returned. Just then one of them
was called to the telephone, and he
came back saying the boys' skiff had
been found, but that there was no trace
of the hunte:s. After a conference
they decided to go first of all to Berke
ley, f^e the men who had picked up
the skiff and find out the best place to
look for the bodies. To assist them in
th'ir search they took along one of my
Whitehall boats. They left here at 8
a. m., and the last time I saw the
launch she was steering a course for
the north end of Goat Island."
"All I know is that I escaped by the
skin -h." said Captain Chres
Gustafson. "There was a light haze on
th-- water, but I could see Goat Island
distinctly and I steered a direct course
for the north end .if the island. As to
how the accident happened I haven't
the faintest idra. One thing I can
swear toâ l had a clear course and
there were no whistles blown. The
first thing I knew was that something
had turned the William D on her side
and the water was rushing into the
engine-room. I was nearly smothered
for a moment, and then I remember
grabbing the window frame and the
next instant I was on the surface of
the water. I saw the paddle-wheel of
the Oakland coming down, and. making
a dive. I got under it. Then I saw Mr.
Wattles making a very poor struggle
for his life, and, thinking he was hurt.
I went to his assistance. Poor fellow,
he went down for the last time as I was
putting out my hand to help him. I
then swam back and got into the Mc-
Arthur's launch, after which we raced
for the wharf with the injured men."
"It was a little hazy when we left our
slip on the 8 a. m. run," said Captain
William Clairville. "I could see Goat
Island, however, but did not see the
launch until she was down on us. I
cannot for the life of me understand
how she came to /run into us or how
any one of thfc people aboard escaped.
The first time I saw the little boat was
when I looked down out of the pilot
house and saw her under our star
board bow. I turned to the mate, who
was with me in the pilothouse, and said,
"She is. getting very close.' "Too . '.
close,' said he: 'we'd better go astern.'
With that he blew the danger signal
and rang up full speed astern in the
room. As soon as they got the
dangfr signal on the launch she seemed
to swing right into us, and struck the
r Â»akland just forward of the paddle
box. Luckily our paddles began to go
astern and the wash from them threw
the boat away from the Oakland, or
SAX FRANCISCO, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1899.
else everybody on board would have
been killed."
"We had run about 750 yards from
our slip and the boat had not gath
ered full headway when the accident
occurred," said First Mate J. H. Doug
las of the Oakland. "I noticed that the
launch was getting very close to us,
and spoke to the captain about it. I
then blew the danger signal and re
versed the engines, but before we could
gather sternway the William D struck
us. The paint on our hull forward of
the paddlebox was scraped off when
she struck us, and I think that was all
the damage done the Oakland. We got
our boat out as quickly as possible and
did everything we could to save life;
when we could not do anything more
to help them we resumed our run and
reported the disaster on our return to
this side."

tain Serburr'r. home and gave the fol
lowing account of the accident: "I was
in the cabin at the time the collision
occurred. It was shortly after 8 a. m.
There were five of us on the launch,
viz., Frank E. Orr, Charles C. Finn,
Otis Wattles, myself and the engineer,
referred to as 'captain.'
"The steamer Oakland struck us with
her starboard wheel and knocked all
the roof of the launch off. We were all
thrown into the bay. The stern of the
launch was, however, above water, and
I ?wam to it and held on there until I
was picked ttÂ« A boat was lowered
from the Oakland and also one from
the revenue cutter. The Oakland's
â¢ picked up Orr and the revenue
cutter's boat picked up Finn. Orr was
taken to the Harbor Receiving HosDit
al, but died a few moments afterward.
<nis Wattles was not seen after the
collision and his body was not recov
ered.
"With regard to the hopes of picking
up William Seabury and E. J. Finn,
they are becoming slendered even" mo
ment. Mrs. Seabury is prostrated by
anxiety and sorrow. Several boats and
launches are out along the Berkeley
shore near Point Richmond looking for
any traces of the lost boys."
Charles C. Finn, one of the five in the
launch, related his experience as fol
lows: Mr. Mathews engaged the
launch and telephoned to me to start
for San Francisco by the 7 a. m. train.
I asked him the name of the launch, so
that if I missed Mr. Mathews on the
train I should know what launch to in
quire for, and he told me William D.
We had started only a few minutes
from Peterson's wharf at the foot of
Folsom street when we saw ourselves
in danger of being run down by the
steamer Oakland, which left the city
wharf at S o'clock. I was on the stern
of the boat, but was not sure at first
that we should be struck. I called to
the engineer (Peterson's man) and cast
off the Whitehall towing astern of our
launch. I jumped into the Whitehall,
but when the paddle-wheel of the
steamer struck us I thought I should
be crushed by it, and dived down. When
I came up I saw a life buoy one of the
passengers of the Oakland had thrown
overboard and got hold of it. The rev
enue cutter's launch picked me up,
however, and the steamer's boat picked
up Orr. Frank Orr had been away
from Portland for about eight years.
He came to California at the time of
the Midwinter Exposition and had
charge of the concession department.
He had been in the employ of Monte
leagre Brothers, the California street
commission merchants and coffee deal
ers "
The news of the terrible disaster
reached Berkeley in the course of the
morning and spread rapidly through
the town. When it was learned, in ad
dition, that the scow in which young
Seabury and Finn started had been
found near Alcatraz sympathy for the
bereaved families was felt on all sides.
Otis Wattles was the only son of Mr.
and Mrs. J. C. Wattles of 2235 Dana
street and was very popular among his
friends. He was about 18 years of age.
He attended the Lick School in this
city.
At the homes of the other two boys,
Edward Finn and William Seabury,
scarcely any hope is entertained for
their return and the families accept the
conclusion that they must have per
ished.
A report was spread at first that the
scow had been found without the oars
and rowlocks. This gave some hope
that the boat had possibly drifted from
its moorings, leaving the two boys
stranded and unable to obtain assist
ance. The report, however, could not
be confirmed and it was later learned
that both oars and rowlocks were with
the boat when it was found, but had
b^en removed by the man who found it
before being turned over to the au
thorities.

JILSON'S SHAME IS LAID BARE
WRIGHT IN
A NEW ROLE
Accused of Taking Honey
Under False Colors.
Another interesting side light has been thrown on the checkered
career of Howard E. Wright Speaker of the Assembly. The du
plicity of Wright in public life has been proved by his own testimony.
His double dealing and false representations in private business transac
tions are established now by the evidence of reputable men who accuse
him of having made them his victims. The facts are timely for a double
reason, as they show beyond dispute that Wright is insensible to the or
dinary rules of honesty, and as early as last August declared himself em
phatically a supporter- of D. M. Burns for the position which the Mexi
can is now seeking.
Wright is accused of having obtained, under the grossest misrepre
sentation. $50 from F. R. Pendergrass, a searcher of records and real
estate dealer of Visalia. It will be remembered that Howard E.
Wright was at ~ne time secretary and manager of the California Title
Insurance and Trust Company. Mr. Wright's peculiar business methods
did not meet wrth the favor of the officers of the corporation and the re
sult was that in May he resigned his position. He asked that the resig
nation take effect on July 1, but the directors, wishing to be rid of an
undesirable employe, decided to accept the resignation at once.
Wright severed therefore on June 1 all connection with the cor
poration. After that day he had no authority to represent himself as an
agent of the California Title, Insurance and Trust Company. It is now
charged that Wright, about the middle of last August, falsely represented
himself to be an agent of the corporation and through this misrepre
sentation obtained from F. R. Pendergrass of Visalia $50. which sum he
has never repaid.
At that time Pendergrass had a client named J. W. C. Pogue, who
lives eighteen miles from Visalia, and wished to secure a loan. Pen
dergrass came to this city and met Wright. The Visalia real estate
dealer claims that Wright represented himself to be an agent of the Cali
fornia Title, Insurance and Trust Company. Upon this false representa
tion Pendergrass says he paid Wright $50 with which to defray the ex
penses of the bogus agent to Visalia and return. Wright promised to
examine the security, which Pogue offered for a loan, and to report to
the corporation, which at that time he had no authority to represent.
Neither Pendergrass nor Pogue knew of these facts until later, when
they indignantly denounced W'right for his unscrupulous business du
plicity. The Speaker, however, has not returned the money.
While Wright was at Visalia it is claimed that he took Pendergrass
and Pogue into his confidence in reference to his legislative aspirations
and his prospective action in connection with the United States Senator
ship. Rumors have been afloat in the Assembly District that Wright
misrepresents that the Speaker was bound to Burns months ago and
would deliver himself whenever he was demanded by the Mexican.
The incident at Visalia leaves no doubt of the truth of the rumors.
According to Pendergrass and Pogue Wright himself declared
that he was for Burns whenever Burns wanted him. Pendergrass says
that while the negotiations in reference to Pogue's property were in
progress Wright discussed volubly on his ambition to represent his dis
trict in the Assembly. The Visalia real estate man says that in August
Wright told him that he was a candidate for the Assembly and would
win the nomination. Wright said that he had an opponent, but ex
pected no difficulty in getting-him out of the way. This conversation,
as the public is aware, had reference to the payment of $250 to William
B. Pringle.
Wright, according to Pendergrass, declared further that he would not
only be elected to the Assembly, but would be chosen Speaker of that
body. He boastingly announced that he had obtained the assistance of
D. M. Burns in his candidacy for the Speakership. In his capacity as
Speaker. Wright said that he would exercise considerable influence in
the selection of the next United States Senator and in that contest he
announced himself most emphatically as the supporter of Burns.
These facts are now extremely significant as they reveal the exist
ence of some of the dark political by ways through which Wright passed
to win the station he has disgraced. Long before his nomination Wright
was a political chattel of Bums, held in reserve and under a mask of
honor. The mask at the proper time was withdrawn, but the play was
too palpable. While Mexican Dan tried to use the dishonorable occu
pant of an honorable place to create a stampede he simply exposed to
public shame the man he used. Wright carried only himself to the pil
lory of public scorn.
tain Clairvllle was for years mate of
the Piedmont, and some time ago was
raised to the rank of captain. Douglas
has been on the boats almost from the
beginning of the service, and Is one of
the trusted men of the employ.
During the afternoon Peterson se
cured wrecking appliances and sent the
launch Amy out to grapple for thÂ«
sunken boat. The tide had evidently
carried the William D away, as up to
dark no trace of her could be found.
The search for her will be carried on
again to-day, and the men at work <-> n
the job hope that they may also recov
er the body of Mr. Wattles.
GRANT'S MONEY
WAS USED IN
HIS CAMPAIGN
Siskiyou's Assemblyman Re
ceived the Benefit of Four
Hundred Dollars.
TO SECOND HIS NOMINATION
Had a Masterly Speech Already
Prepared, but Destroyed It
When He Went Over to
the Burns Camp.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 22.â people of Siski
you County will have to blush again !
for their representative in the lower \
house of the Legislature. The Call is j
in possession of facts to prove that C. j
B. Jilson received the benefit of $400 \
from one of the promoters of U. S. j
Grant's campaign for the Senatorship. !
The proof that Jilson received the j
benefit of the money and that it was
money paid In the interest of Grant ;
will be presented to the committee of
investigation.
Jilson started out to vote for Grant,
and did cast his vote for the San Diego
statesman on the first ballotâ bal
lot taken in separate session. It was on
the programme that Jilson should make
a speech : in tiie-Jcint convention, ; sec
onding the nomination of U. 1 S. : Grant,
but 'within twenty- four hours after he
voted for Grant and promised to make i
the speech indorsing Grant, he changed
his mind and voted for Burns.
The preparation of that speech lends
a touch of humor to the situation. The
Siskiyou statesman prepared it with
infinite care and patience. The ora
tion, for such it was called, was elo
quent and inspiring. It was a classic
for fireside reading in Siskiyou. It was
pure and lofty in tone, suitable in all
respects to the home circles. It was a
thing of beauty and would have been a
joy forever had not the author decided ;
to destroy it after he changed his mind
and resolved to cast his vote for Burns.
The Call is in possession of the es
sential, features of the remarkable â  ef
fort. In his prepared but undelivered
speech the Siskiyou Assemblyman said:
"Mr. President: I rise to second the
nomination of U. S. Grant Jr. for the
high position of United States Senator
in Congress. Among all the worthy
candidates whose names have been pre
sented to your consideration there is
not one who stands as hieh as Grant.
He bears an Illustrious name and in
many of his traits of character, as well
as in his physical features, he bears a
striking resemblance to his noble
father.
"Speaking for Siskiyou County, I can
say that the people of that region
heartily indorse the candidate whose
cause I have the honor and privilege
to advocate before this joint assembly
of the Legislature of California. The
magic name of Grant will give to Cali
fornia a position and prestige in the
Senate of the United States which no j
other name could secure. The gentle
man whose claims I present is a resi- !
dent of the southland, but his fame
extends to all regions of the State.
From the eternal . snows of Shasta's j
crest to the waves that kiss the beach
of Coronado the people sound the
praises of Grant."
There was more of the same kind of
eloquence in Jilson's flight of oratory.
This evening Mr. Jilson was asked to
allow The Call to publish the text of
the remarkable oration. At first he
modestly denied that he had prepared
a speech, seconding the nomination of
Grant, but subsequently added: "If I
had prepared a speech you could not
get a copy of it now."
When assured* that The Call had in
formation that it was one of the ablest
nominating speeches of the session, the i
author observed that he intended the j
people should Judge what he could do I
in that line.
Further inquiries regarding this re- i
markable production bring to light the
interesting fact that Jilson dictated the
speech to a stenographer and that after
the first dictation he had the speech
typewritten and revised. ' He went over j
the revised speech, \ correcting one j
Greek quotation and polishing some of
the sentences which seemed to be a
little too crude for this Legislature, i
Perhaps the revised copy was submit
ted to Jim Brown. It is not Improbable
that Grant himself, who is a college
man and a scholar whose intellectual
attainments are vouched for by Sena
tor Perkins, added a few graceful and
classic touches to the effort.;
No difference what was done In the
way of finishing touches the speech and
the shorthand notes were destroyed. In
order that no record should be left of |
Jilson's intention to eulogize , Grant the |
Assemblyman . tore from the stenog- }
rapher's notebook the shorthand notes. I
The typewritten copy was . then de- I
stroyed, and Jilson now believes that J
PRICE FIVE CENT&
all the traces of the dictated speech
have been obliterated.
In a general way at first, and sub
j sequently in a detailed manner, Jilson
| explained haw he got into the Grant
; camp and how he took shelter in the
I Burns fold. He related that Senator
Perkins wanted a southern man elected
| Senator and was favorable to Grant.
i Jilson wanted to oblige his friend Per
i kins, and so consulted with Milton J.
Green. '
The assurance came from Green that
| Grant was very strong, so strong that
J he would be elected United States Sen
ator on the second ballot. Comment
ing further on this information, Jilson
| said:
"I voted for Grant on the first ballot
and did promise that I .would make a
speech In the joint Assembly, second
ing the nomination of Grant, but when
i I saw that he only received twenty
j seven votes on that ballot I concluded
that he was not in the race. Now, my
people in Siskiyou want something, and
as I found that Grant was not In the
favor of the State administration I
changed my mind after the first ballot
and voted for Burns. 1
Regarding the statement that $400
was placed in his district in the inter
est of Grant, and that a person would
testify that the money was paid to him
(Jilson), the Assemblyman replied:
"Wait until he testifies before you
I publish that statement. He will not
testify that the money was paid for
Grant, or that it was Grant money. Be
fore you publish any statement of this
character wait until he testifies to the
conditions of the payment of money.
i There was no money -~'d to me for my
I canvass or for my support of any can
didate. Yes, I know that he is a truth
ful man and will tell the whole story
straight." '

JIKXTO, Jan. 22.â The members of the
Aps-t-mbly are hereby given notice tnat
Colonel D. M. Burns lays claim to the
power to make them vote as he wishes.
He hap given Speaker Howard E. Wright
a promise that the Assembly will not pun

$1650 from U. S. Grant, through Miltnn J.
Green, in return for a promise to vote for
Grant for Senator.
111 making this promise. Burns has not
consulted the wishes of the men who can
make its fulfillment possible. He has sim-
ply promised Wright immunity from pun
ishment, and he will keep his promiseâ if
he can. That he owns the Assembly no one
believes, but that he will attempt to pro
tect the man whom he forced or per
suadedâthe sort of persuasion used not
being mentionedâ to desert the candidate
to whom he had sold himself, is i\> w an
open secret.
Should Wright be publicly and officially
condemned and thrown out of the Assem
bly he has disgraced by his presence the
circumstance would be the final death
blow to the Senatorial aspirations of Col
onel Burns. Wright must be retained in
his seat and his position at all hazards,
and to do this Colonel Burns has under
taken to manipulate the members of the
Assembly and thus withhold the seal of
condemnation and sentence already passed
by the public.
While Burns is pulling the strings that
he hopes will control, nr, at least, direct
the acts of the committee to which has
been delegated the task of exposing
Wright's criminality, Wright himself is
engaged in doing the "baby act" with
such of the legislators as permit him to
address them. It is needless to point to
the fact that an innocent man would
scorn to peddle the story of his shame
from member to member and seek sym
pathy and plead for leniency from those
who will ultimately, pass upon the merits
of the charge against him. A man con
scious of his own innocence would not so
humiliate himself as to thus sacrifice his
own dignity, but would rather preserve
it by silence, being confident that truth
would prevail and the justice of his cause
become apparent to all.
AftÂ»r Spenkt-r Wright had been convict
ed out of his <>wn mouth by his testimony
f riven before the investigating committee,
t became plainly apparent to his present
owner, Colonel Burns, that if he wad to be
saved some radical measures must be
adopted at once. To this end an effort
was made to increase the size of the com
mittee by the addition of two new mem
bers, one a suporter of Colonel Burns and
the other a follower of Grant. The Burns
man would be obedient to the orders of
his master. The other could be controlled
through threats of further exposures in
jurious to the cause of the gentleman
from San Diego. This scheme fell through
because no Grant man could be found who
would consent to s,erve on the committee.
This plan having failed, influence was
brought to bear on the committee to
quash the whole inquiry. In the mean
time grave charges had been alleged
against Chairman Cosper of the commit
tee, but in spite of this orders were car
ried out and for one entire day nothing
was done in the matter of the investiga
tion. Subpenas were held up and other
Bubpenas that were asked for were do'
nied. The intent of such a course was so
palpable that an indignation meeting on
the floor of the Assembly was threatened,
and had not the Burns forces made a
rapid "switch" the committee would have
â¢been shorn of authority and another
would have been appointed to take its
place. Driven into a corner, the Burns
manipulators again tried to secure the
appointment of two additional members
on the committee, but again failed on ac
count of the reluctance of the Grant men
to be hauled up to the rack.
Another conference was necessary and
after it was over "advice" was issued to
the obstructionists on the committee to
proceed with the investigation, but to
afreet t..e course of the inquiry in any
direction save that of Speaker Wright.
The present plan is to force the com
mittee to prolong the investigation; which
is to be diverted from the guilty Speaker.
By doing this it is hoped Wright will be
forgotten for the time being. In the
meantime he will be thus afforded the
time and the excuse to make tearful ap
peals to his fellow-members, these appeals
being helped along with such threats an
Burns and his followers may believe will
prove effective in forcing the members to
assist him in plastering the disgraced
Speaker with a coat of hand-made white
wash.
The delay caused by the prolongation of
the investigation will serve still another
purpose. It will serve to put the support
ers â¢of Senatorial candidates other than
Burns in a mood to go into caucus. If
this result can be attained Burns believes
he has sufficient strength to have himself
made the caucus nominee.
Burns cannot win in the open, a fact
now frankly admitted by his friends. His
only hope lays in forcing a caucus. It, is
not at all' certain that he could secure
enough votes to be made the caucus nom
inee, but it is his last and only hope, and
his every effort is now being directed to
that' end.
PECULIAR MEASURES
BEFORE THE ASSEMBLY
CAT.L, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MEXTO, Jan. 22.â The good old "cinch
hill" of infamous history has not cnmn
out yet on the open floor of the Lepisbi
turp, albeit that there are a half dozen
hills in committee that are being closely
â watched by suspicious eyes. Neither has
the "lobby" swelled to its usual ample
proportions, and thin despite the fact that
there are bills and bills carrying fat ap
propriations over which any well-regulat
ed member of the third house would
smack his lips in pleasurable anticipation.
There are other measures, though, that
are just now making their way through
the mazes of committee procedure that
are of rather more than passing interest
as working radical changes in the econ
omy of city and country.
Assemblyman Merrill of San Francisco
has one in the hands of the Committee on
County and Township Governments that
is for the sole benefit of San Francisco
County. It provides that the governing
body of any city of over 100,000 ponulation
may pay and allow a monthly pension of
not exceeding $30 to tne widow of any
fireman who has been killed while in the
active discharge of his duties. Such pen
sion shall be payable until remarriage.
The law is to take eitect immediately
upon its passage, and is so constructed
that pensions may be paid to women who
nave been widowed previous to its pas
sage as well us after.
The Committee on Commerce and Navi
gation is considering a bill by Assembly
man Kenneally of San Francisco, which,
if it becomes a law, will provide $75,000 out
of the State treasury for tnp construction
of a fireboat and equipment necessary for
the protection of the shipping and build
ings and docks in San Francisco, San
Pablo and Suisun bays, and adjacent nav
igable rivers. The boat shall have a pump
ing capacity of SOOO gallons per minute
and a speed of twenty miles an hour, and
shall be stationed at the city of San
Francisco or at any municipality the Gov
ernor may designate as long as t.Â»e said
municipality shall pay the expense out of
its own funds.
Assemblyman Burnett of San Luis
Obispo County has a bill in the hands of
the Ways and Means Committee asking
for an appropriation of $100,000 for the
erection and maintenance of a school to
be known as the California Polytechnic
School, to be built in San Luis" Obispo
County. Within thirty days after the
passage of the act the Governor shall ap
point five persons who shall act as trus
tees, and. select the site for th* proposed
institution, which shall be goverened by
the rules regulating Stale Normal
schools.
The Judiciary Committee is discussing:
a bill by Assemblyman Works of . San
Diego, which fixes the legal rate of in
terest at 12 per centum per annum, and
provides as a penalty for a charge in ex
cess of this rate that the note or account
shall be rendered worthless. The bill ex
empts pawnbrokers in the ordinary
course of their business.
Assemblyman Arnerich of Santa Clara
has introduced a series of bills which
have for their object the protection of
California's fruit interests. Quarantine
regulations are fixed against the importa
tion of any plant life infected with de
stroying diseases and against any ani
mals or insects injurious to plant life.
The same regulations extend to exporta
tion. Another of his bills provides for
an appropriation to pay the expense of
sending a representative to New Zealand
and Australia for the purpose of collect
ing and bringing to this State predaceous
insects that are beneficial to plant life
and inimical to diseases and insects that
have a tendency to destroy. His bills are
in the hands of the Health and Quaran
tine Committee.
Assemblyman Meade of Los Angeles will
in a day or so add another to the already
long list of bills he has introduced in the
Assembly which have for their object the
correction of the many weak spots in the
laws governing municipalities.
In nearly every case the needs of his
own town have been the incentive to his
proposed legislation. Yesterday he hand
ed in a bill which if passed will save the
city $40,000 annually by abolishing the of
fices of City Treasurer, Assessor and Tax
Collector, and compelling the county of
ficers to perform the work of the abol
ished offices.
His latest bill, which will be recorded
during the coming week, is designed to
ASSEMBLYMAN CLOUGH BEFORE THE INVESTIGATING COMMITTEE.
THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1899.
give the thriving Southern city control of
its own growth. Los Angeles has of late
years gained a reputation for annexation
and has nearly outgrown its blooming or
ange groves. Under the present law if one
of the numerous outlying districts takes
the idea that it would rather be part and
parcel of the city, it circulates a petition,
gets it signed by 20 per cent of its voters
and then goes into the city and does the
same thing. The petition is presented to
the City Council, which is obliged to call
an annexation election. The law is man
datory on that point. If two districts are
ready to come in at the same time there
must be two elections on successive days
and a different board of election officers
is required for each, just doubling the ex
pense. Another weak point is that the
Council has no right to modify or change
in any way the boundaries of the new dis
tricts, no matter how awkward they may
be. All these things Mr. Meade's bill will
change. It will make annexation elec
tions optional with the Council anu will
give it the right to regulate boundaries
and include all petitions in the same elec
tion. The bill pertains not only to Los
Angeles, but to all chartered cities.
BIG SUMS ASKED FOR
OAKLAND'S HARBOR
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 22.â A quarter of a million
dollars is a large sum, but it is the sum
Senator Frank Leavitt of Oakland de
sires to have transferred from the gen
eral fund of the State to the Oakland har
bor fund.
In his bill authorizing the proper officials
to make tnis transfer Mr. Leavitt does
not set forth the specific uses to which it
is to be put. The transfer authorized is,
however, as a matter of fact, an appro
priation. However, it is very easy to as
certain what uses this $250,000 is to be put
when Senate bill No. 10, introduced by
Senator Leavitt, is read, which bill is now
in the hands of the committee.
Senate bill number ten creates th< har
bor of Oakland and defines its boundar
ies. It authorizes the appointment of
three commissioners to constitute the
Oakland Harbor Commission, and pro
vides for the appointment of a small army
of employes and attaches of the commis
sion. It provides that any disobedience
of the ruies or regulations of the board
shall be punishable by fine or imprison
ment, and the depositing of any substance
obstructing navigation shall be punish
able by a tine of $500.
The bill has one singular incongruity in
it, for it provides that the Attorney Gen
eral shall furnish advice, to the board
when required, yet it also provides for an
attorney for the board. All told, places
are provided for about thirty people. Of
course there will be some fees and
charges collected, and they are to go into
the State treasury. The fees and charges
will not, however, meet the expenditures
contemplated, for there are provisions in
the biil looking to sundry improvements.
As yet no petitions have been received
from Oakland citizens or commercial
bodies asking for the passage of either
of these bills. Some are expected, how
ever, before the committee to which they
have been referred to will act. In the
meantime there are several prominent
Oaklanders in Sacramento who are en
gaged in the task of paying the way for
a small army of lobbyists who are ex
pected in the near future and whose duty
it will be to see that no obstructions are
placed in the way of the much-wanted
law and the accompanying appropriation, i
HOWARD E. WRIGHT FAILS
TO MAKE RESTITUTION
Grant Begins to Despair of Ever Re
covering His Offering to the
Speaker.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.â Howard K. Wright,
Speaker of the Assembly, over a week ago promised to repay $750 to Milton
J. Green, or U. S. Grant, from whom he received it, together with a fur
ther sum of $900, all of which he obtained under an understanding that he
would vote for Grant for Senator.
Speaker Wright claims that this was a commercial obligation.
It is now ten days since this same Howard E. Wright stated that he was
going- to have- his clerks, speaking as if he had a small army of them, place
$4000 or $5000 to his credit and direct them to forthwith send to Milton J.
Green a check for the amount of money which he considered due Mr. Green,
owing to his failure to support Grant.
But "Mr. Speaker" has, up to 9 o'clock this evening, failed to make any
restitution. The rains which he prayed for, that he might be enabled to
make some of the real estate trades and collections, about which he con
verses so freely, have come and gonÂ«, but the Grant people have not yet re
ceived their money. That $900 "gift" Wright testified to receiving from
Green he declined to answer on the stand as to whether he felt obliged to
pay. But to private individuals he admitted that as he had not voted for
Grant he would return the $900 Green gave him. This indicated he thought
it was a consideration handed him for voting for Grant.
The Grant people at first had some confidence in Wright's statement that
he would return them their money. They need it, and they were glad to hear
that they would get it back. But it has not come. Mr. Wright may have di
rected his clerks to make the big deposit to his credit and told them to send
up the check or draft to Mr. Green or Mr. Grant, but the check has not
turned up here yet. Gradually, as the days go by, the Grant people are losing
faith in Howard E. Wright's promise to give them back their money. A
few more days' delay on the part of Wright and they will lose faith en
tirely.
LITTLE CHANGE
LOOKED FOR OH
TO-DAY'S BALLOT
Barnes Likely to Make
a Gain.
THE LEADERS STILL HANG ON
GRANT AND BURNS SAY THEY
WILL NOT GIVi, UP.
The Colonel Will Have to Show How
All His Money Was Spent in
the San Jtfrancisco Dis
tricts.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 22.-^The Senatorial barome
ter does not give any indication of a
marked change in the political atmos
phere. It is said to-night that the can
didates will poll their usual strength
on the balloting to-morrow. A slight gain
for General Barnes is one of the proba
bilities. The assertion is made with
great emphasis that there will be no break
away from Grant while he is under fire.
The followers of Burns declare they also
will stand firmer than ever since the edict
has gone forth that their candidate must
answer to the charge of using money to
promote his fight for a place in the United
States Senate.
The Grant men are determined that the
inquiry concerning the improper use of
money in the contest shall not be allowed
to stop at the door of their candidate.
They insist that the committee shall re
quire Dan Burns and his managers to
account for every dollar of money ex
-I>.-nded in the legislative districts of San
Francisco. It will be interesting to as
certain from whom the money was re
ceived and to whom it was paid. Burns
is accredited with paying into the fund
of the Republican State Central Commit
tee generous sums of money. The touts
point with pride to this generosity as
proof that Dan is a thoroughbred in put
ting up coin to win Republican victories.
Careful inquiry may disclose the fact
that this money did not come out of the
colonel's private resources.
The notion that Grant will quit under
fire is not one that Is accepted in this
quarter. His fight is hopeless, but when
he goes out of the race he will take Burns
with him. The tout* boast that Dan
is in the fight to stay, if it takes the
"Candelaria mine." Insiders who have
facilities for estimating the financial re
sources of the two candidatesâ Burns and
Grant â fancy that Burns' mine would
make a sorry showing alongside the sack
that the Grant syndicate could show up.
T.ie committee report of the investiga
tion may turn out to be a two-edged
sword if it is not shaped exactly right.
If it be sharpened to cut Grant to the
quick it will also cleave Burns' friend,
Howard Wright. A prediction is made
that the committee will not recommend
any action to the Assembly, but will sim
ply present certain conclusions establish
ed by the testimony and leave it to the
Assemblymen to inflict whatever punish
ment or discipline they deem necessary.
The Speaker has evidently a hint of the
committee's intention, for he is now
working to avert deserved punishment.
The Grant men in the Legislature will
fight with desperation before they will
consent to the infliction of a brand of in
famy on their candidate. They may allow
censure of their chief for over-zeal and
excessive generosity in contributing funds
to achieve the election of a Republican
Legislature, but they will never consent to
the adoption of a report that Grant or
his managers used money to bribe mem
bers to vote for the San Diego candidate.
Before the end comes Burns' may be in as
deep as Grant. Then there will be a cry
of whitewash for two.
Senator George C. Perkins has written
friendly letters to several of the aspirants
for Senator White's seat in the Senate,
but the testimony is daily disclosing the
fact that Perkins is in Grant's fight up
to his neck. There is much comment
here on Per-vins' attitude.

WILLIAM F. HERRIN
GOES TO SAPRAMENTO
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 22.â William F. Herrin,
chief of the Southern Pacific Company's
political bureau, arrived in Sacramento
to-night in a piivate car attached to the
Oregon express. The car was run on the
sidetrack opposite the icehouse, a fact
that has given rise to a rumor that the
boss bungler will be suffering from a se
vere attack of cold feet in the morning
after he wakes up and is called to the wit
ness stand before the Assembly investi
gating committee. The sergeant at arms
of the committee went to San Francisco
to serve the subpena on Mr. Herrin. After
the paper had been read to him the
thirfty politician asked the sergeant at
arms if he was prepared to pay the mile
age. Upon receiving a negative reply
Herrin rather insisted that he should be
paid the mileage fees before he recog
nized the subpena, but after ascertaining
that the officer had not provided himself
with sufficient cash to comply with the
demand he let the matter drop.
i
HIS HONESTY
Judge Clough Has Gained an
Enviable Reputation With
the People.
WAITING FOR THE BREAK
AH Factions in the Senatorial
Fight Realize It Must Soon
Come, and All Express
Great Confidence.
BY HENRY JAMES.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 22.â The art of legislation
is practiced for the most part without
spectacular effects. In truth, the ob
server is apt to feel bored, and even
the voice of the clerk, a voice designed
to lure him from distant fields, faith
fully rattling: off the contents of a bill
to which nobody pays any attention,
is conducive to a somnambulency
which the hardness of the wooden
chairs can barely overcome. Neverthe
less a study of individual members is
interesting.
The most admirable character yet
developed is Judge Clough. An elderly
man, his form stooped, his unkempt
beard turning to gray, and his deaf
ness such that his hand is frequently
utilized as an ear trumpet, there is in
his voice the ring of sincerity, and any
man looking into his face would know
it as the face of a man to be trusted,
and whose word might be accepted as
final. I do not think he could have
In view any evil purpose, nor that an
inducement could be offered which
would swerve him from the path of
right. I would call Judge Clough a
beautiful moral type, and be glad to
see a Legislature composed of his
peers. There will never be such a Legis
lature. This world, tainted and bitter,
does not have the material.
When Judge Clough told the commit
tee on investigation that Dan Cole had
written to him a letter containing an
offer to pay his campaign expenses, all
doubt, if doubt existed, that such a
letter had been written, vanished. Dan
Cole may explain that Dehlnd it was a
high and holy purpose; that it was not
an intended bribe in behalf of Grant,
and what the committee may do about
it no one can tell, but everybody who
heard Judge Clough's testimony will
believe it absolutely, though the kindly
heart of the old man shrank from say
ing aught to wound the friend of many
years.
Dibble is another who attracts atten
tion. He is always at his post, ground
ed in parliamentary usaere and tready
in contention. So is Johnson of Sac
ramento, who is suave and irrascible,
read" for a bout, which he conducts on
gentlemanly lines. He says a mean
thing well, albeit through his nose. He
does not like the papers, but as there
are others this does not constitute him
a class. Radcliffe can make a speech
with a point to it and on s le occasions
the point has penetrated the Johnson
armorâ whereupon has ensued the
clash of arms, always terminating in
the withdrawal of the offending words.
Perhaps such words leave no sting.
Never having been a legislator, I do
not know.
Cosper won prominence by being
made chairman of the investigating
committee, and Melllck was projected
into the light by his membership of the
same body. Both these men are for
I Bulla, and while they may have de
rived some joy from the d/agglng in of
Grant, Cosper was dragf^d in himself,
; and then a witness reached out and
i brought Bulla in, too. As a partial
compensation, Burns has been subpe
. I naed, as well as others supposed to
know something about the expenditure
. of the colonel's money. I suspect Mel
lick of dyspepsia.
As a member of the Assembly. La
I Barre has said nothing, and as a mcm
i j ber of the committee, not much, but he
i is at every meeting, is alertly attentive
! and wants to know if Grant money
| went into his distrir* Grant's man
| ager said that money had gone there.
j and as La Barre is not accused of
1 knowing it. he is naturally curious to
find out who got it. La Barre is smooth -
shaven and spectacled, with the air of
a scholar. Opposite him sit Burnette
and Sanford. Burnette strikes me as
an able and earnest member, anxious
for the truth, and being a Populist and
Democratic combination he can get
into a Republican muss without fear.
Sanford has the same advantages of
having no Republican candidate to
I hurt, and all candidates seem to look
j alike to him.
I have been glad to speak well of thig
: committee, only urging it once to raise
the temperature of its feet. Then the
: mercury did go up. Of course the ma
jurity, personally, would be glad to let
I go. They cannot more than surmise
where they will be led. My belief is
that in the exploitation of the Speaker's
disgraceful tactics, and the bringing of
that official into- contempt the commit
tee accomplished nearly all its work.
No whitewash could save Wright. As
to the testimony concerning Burns it
will resolve itself into a simple ques
tion of veracity, with the witnesses
about equal in number. Outsiders may
weigh the integrity of these witnesses;
for the committee to do so would re
quire a degree of courage such as it
may not possess. If there is any way
of escape, however, from the charge
that Cole wrote the letter Judge Clough
told about, and that its purpose was as
asserted by the Judge, I fail to see it.
However, if it can be proved that can
didates have bribed or tried to bribe
there will remain no course but to
throw them all out and select one
whose camp is not under suspicion.
Yet if any of the factions are on the
verge of being terrorized into disin
tegration they have still the nerve to
conceal their symptoms.
This has been a quiet and restful
day. The sun has been shining and thÂ«
politicians have been absent. Many of
them went to the city last night.
I have talked to-day with Grant men,
Bulla men and Burns men, and all of
them exhibit splendid faith. None of
the lot is ready to admit the possibility
of defeat. The Bulla fullowers depend
upon a break which is certain to come,
the Grant men upon general principles,
the Burns men upon the fealty of their
adherents, the caucus and the inevi
table break which they say will be to
their advantage. All leave the Barne*
men out of reckoning, although the
reason for this is not clear.
Much will depend upon the investiga
tion. If it can be demonstrated that
money has been improperly used by
any candidate he might as well bank
his fires and go home. It must be re
membered, however, that the verdict of
the committee, and not the verdict of
the individual, will be the standard of!
judgment. If there is any gentleman
who is whiter than snow and who has
Senatorial ambitions now is his time to
get in.
A local paper has seen fit to
jump all over me for having made
a mistake and then corrected it. I
expected some small soul to do this.
The mistake and the correction seem to
irritate about equally. As a matter of
fact, when data has to be hastily gath
ered there is always the nossibilitv of
error, and the man who, finding him
self wrong, will not make a correction
is, to express the truth mildly, a lunk
head and an ass. The opinion alluded
to is as near immaterial to me as any
thing could be, but the buzzing of a
mosquito is annoying. When I arrive
at the high estate of being free from
mortal weakness it will be time to take
a pledge against declaring myself per
fect. In the meantime, to the critic ia
left the pleasing sense of perfection,
and upon it modesty forbids intrusion.
A Democrat said this afternoon that,
while his peo"le had expected to vote
for White to the end, they were get
ting so sick of the daily roll call with
the stereotyped result that he did not
know what would happen, but thoueht
some Democrats were weakening and
would, throw a few votes any time these
would be suttir'ent to end- the contest.
To-nifht the situation seems to be
unchanged. The ballot to-morrow will
be the same as it has been; or I miss a
guess. Some startling testimony is ex
pected before the investigating commit
tee, but it will fail to startle, or an
other guess is missed. If Lamberson
a â 'ears he is to tell whether Cospef
offered to support Grant for $6000, but
the fact that the figure is placed so
high would, regardless of the principles
of anybody involved, tend to weaken
tl-e allegation.
Wright has not paid back the '$1650
he received. He said he had ordered it
paid several days ago. Perhaps the
wire? got crosced.
A number of bills not designed to oro
mote the welfare of the public purse
have been introduced. In the excite
ment of not choosing a Senator theÂ«e
things ought not to be overlooked.WRIGHT'S LAST

BURNS DENOUNCED
BY REV. DR. DILLE
Scored From an Oakland Pulpit
for His Raid Upon the
Senatorship.
OAKLAND, Jan. 22.â A remarkably interesting sermon on "The
Prodigal's Elder Brother," by Rev. E. R. Dille, to-night at the First M.
E. Church was listened to by an unusually large throng, and developed
a decidedly interesting word picture of the present condition of affairs
at Sacramento. Dr. Dille said in part:
"The prodical did not steal a loaf of bread or he would not have
come home hungry, nor would he have come home at all. He would
have been arrested on the way. But the man who steals a loaf from
every poor man's table by making a corner in wheat; or who steals a
railroad, or a United States Senatorshlp by bribery is held in honor and
esteem.
"We have an edifying spectacle just nowâ the man who was indicted
for the embezzlement of $31,000 of public funds (a sum which has never
been returned to the State treasury), the patron saint of gamblers; ;he
embodiment of all that is corrupt in political life; the man whose agent
is said to boast that he paid $19,000 for the United States Senatorshlnâ
this man has maintained a reign of terror in California for a fortnight.
By his impudent claim that, through his ownership of the dominant
party and the control of its patronage, as its recognized boss, the Sen
atorship was his chattel; a claim which seems justified by the support
given him by the Republican machine and by the men who betray their
constituents ;â > do his biduinsr. In past years the party bosses have
had the sagacity, i: not the decency, to keep in the b- kground; the
Buckleys, t: Higginses, were accustomed to put reputable men forward
for high offices. But the 'boss system' â the most fearful menace to our
institutions â is producing its legitimate fruit, and the Quays and
Crokers and Burnses are demanding no longer the Jackall's but the lion's
share of the spoils.
"Who is responsible for the 'boss system?' The corporations, whose
pernicious activity In the Senatorial campaign is an outrage upon Cali
fornia and which give the bosses a corruption fund in return for in
fluence; the office-seekers, who sell their mean little souls for said In
fluence, and we, the people, who fill our legislative halls with men who
sell out to the bosses for a consideration.
"The chaplain of a historic Legislature of a thousand scandals
was asked how he could have faith to pray for the goats of- his flock.
'Oh, I djon't,' said the worthy chaplain. 'I look over the crowd and then
pray for the country.'
"There are many good and true men in the California Legislature.
Its personnel, I believe, iB the highest for years, but any member of it
who votes for any man, whatever his name, whose record is stained with
corruption and bribery will be politically past praying for."
Scathing Rebuke of U. S. Grant From the
Pulpit.
STOCKTON, Jan. 22.â Rev. Dr. W. C. Evans, pastor of the Centra!
M. E. f'hurch, made timely reference this evening to the procedure of
I". S. (Jrant at Sacramento. Dr. Evans seldom makes reference to po
litical matters from the pulpit, and is regarded as one of the most con
servative ministers in the city, standing well jvtth all classes. He did
not devoti; n sermon entirely to this matter, but his caustic reference
to the unworthy son of his honored father seemed to meet with the ap
proval of the large and representative congregation present.
The theme of his discourse was upon the enthusiasm of love, and
what might be attained if an honorable course be conscientiously pur
sued in any avocation of life. Dr. Evans said in pÂ»rt:
"On the other hand, the lack of enthusiastic devotion to integrity and
God's laws might fully explain many of those things which cause mis
ery and son uw to mankind. The daily press quite frequently tells of
dlsast. i s that stir our deepest sympathies and saddenour hearts, but the
saddest recital in the columns of the daily press of recent date Is that
telling of the dishonoring of an honored name, famous a l ''- n'i our own
land and the whole worldâ a name which Ml Americans as well as all
the world delights to honorâ by an unworthy son. This Is because of an
inordinate de~lre t.> occupy a pedestal of fame for which he had not
qualified himself, depe led upon a father's fame and a wife's wealth to
force an entrance into the Senate of our land."
Dr. Evans further said that all pood men would a~ree that if such
things did not cease our country would be disgraced. It high time
not only for California but the entire country to repent of these public
disgraces.
and expressing a regard for the sanctity
of the sack, was applauded so vocifer
ously as to arouse the police, a difficult
thing to do.
Colonel Cochmne Is still to be heard
from, but unless he shall sustain the feel
ing which permeates the club he will be
deprived of his title and thrown out.
Wright has violated the ethics of the
club, and . everybody knows It co well
there is no use trying to gloss over the
facts. A state of affairs sufficiently mal
odorous to give Kelly qualms and to
chase Rainey into convulsions must be
very bad. Wright had been repudiated by
decent people and seems to constitute a
class all by himself.
A proposition was mads to contribute
the money to help Wright out of nis
quandary, but it was voted down.
"â I!" I could get that much for a vote,"
said an obscure member, '"I would feel
myself flattered, so I would." This
seomed to be the general idea.
Then the meeting adjourned. It was a
moment of sadness. Kelly and Rainey
stood together at the bar.
"Wat'll it be?" said the man on the
other side.
"Steam," snid Kelly.
"Steam." said Rainey.
And they drank in silence. A sorrow
rested upon them. The iron had entered
their souls. Wright has no friends left.
Some object to the bargain, others think
the bargain all right, but the Good Gov
ernment Club doesn't like tne moral in
solvency show in bargaining one way and
voting another.
PATRONAGE WITHHELD
TO AID BURNS' CAUSE
TAT>T. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 22.â The singular fact has
been commented upon by supporters of all
the Senatorial candidates outside the
camp of Colonel D. M. Burns, that Gov
ernor Henry T. Gage has not, compara
tively speaking, made any appointments
at ail so far. He has not, up to date, gone
beyond the confines of his own law office
in the distribution of places which he has
at his disposition.
Every man, black or white, who was
directly or indirectly connected with his
Los Angeles law office the Governor has
placed in a remunerative position. What
the politicians, outside of those support
ing Colonel Burns, want to know is why
there are no other appointments being
made by Governor Gage.
An explanation Is given by one promi
nent leader and a man who from the
stump rendered great service to the Re
publican party in the recent campaign in
California. He said this evening:
"Governor Gage is making no appoint
ments, for the reason that If he were to
go ahead and do so at this juncture he
would take all the wind out of the sails
of the Burns campaign. The claim ismade
by the Burns men that the colonel has
the patronage of the State administration
at his disposal, and that it will be passed
out as the colonel recommends. This may
be true or it may not. But If Qage were
to go ahead and make appointments now,
every office he tilled would e;:t off one po
siton which Col. Burns' supporters can
hold out as an inducement to secure for
their chief another vote for Senator. I
understand that Burns" touts have al
ready promised about all the positions
Governor Gage has at his disposal, and
that they are now taking t..e back track
and promising them over again.
"My judgment is that the Governor, in
deference to Colonel Burns' wishes, is
making no appointments now, and I be
lieve that when he does make them they
will be made without regard to the prom
ises Burns' supporters have given out.
Gage is a very unruly and stubborn man.
He has his own ideas and opinions of
men and things, and he is not going to
make appointments on the sole rÂ« < "Ri
mendation of anybody. T7<> wii! insist on
knowing something of the man hi
points, something as to his character,
standing and ability."
It is unquestionably true that the Burns
people are making- lots of promises and
are Ftlll giving out the impression that
Colonel Burns has the State patronage
at his disposal. Governor Gage, has how
ever, never so stated and he has not given
any public promise that he will fulfill the
promises of Burns and his friends.
THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1899.
GERMANY SEEKS
MODIFICATION OF
BERLIN TREATY
Tryiog to Pave tfye Way for a
Scheme to Divide the
Samoan Group.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 22.â The Herald's Washington correspondent tele
graphs: As a result of the existing critical situation in Samoa I
have authority for the statement that action will shortly be taken
looking to a modification of the Berlin treaty, under which the
islands are governed. No negotiations to this end are yet in pro
gress, but it is known that the German Government has been considering
the propriety of bringing the matter to the attention of the British and
American governments, and such action would have been taken last summer
had not the war with Spain precluded the consideration of other matters.
Nov.- that the war is ended and a condition of affairs exists in Samoa dan
gerous to the peace of the three powers signatory to the Berlin treaty it
is understood that the German Embassador will place before the State De
partment the views of his Government respecting the necessity for a modi
fication of the treaty.
Appreciating that some such move would result from the late election
of a successor to Malietoa Secretary Hay has been in consultation with
Special Reciprocity Commissioner Kasson, one of the signatories to the Ber
lin treaty. This Government is opposed to any essential modification in the
treaty, but before acting on German suggestions it is understood that Secre
tary Hay and Sir Julian Pauncefote will discuss the matter, and it would
not be surprising if there has not already been some talk in regard to it.
It has been Germany's contention since the treaty was signed that it by no
means meets the needs of the situation and there are some who believe the
present trouble was precipitated in order to demonstrate the correctness of
this contention, as well as to show the necessity of modifying the treaty.
In any event it may be stated authoritatively that Germany would like
to see a final disposition of the Samoan question by a division of the
islands in. this way: Island of Upola. on which Apia is situated, to belong to
Germany; Tutuila, where the United States hold Pago Pago as a coaling
station, to the American Government; and Savali, the northermost island of
the group, to be placed under British sovereignty. There is little reason
to believe that such division 'would be satisfactory to Great Britain, if it
would be satisfactory to the United States. By such division Germany
would get the only plum in the pudding.
When all the facts concerning the election are at hand it Is considered
highly probable that Germany will bring the case of Chief Justice Chambers
to the attention of this .Government. There is little danger of a removal of
Chambers however, as it is proposed by the State Department to uphold
his decision.
No further doubt is entertained in administration circles that Germany
is endeavoring to cultivate friendly relations with this Government. Not only
is this shown by her expressed desire to meet the views of the United
States respecting the Samoan question, but by the change in her attitude
respecting American acquisition of the Philippines, and finally by a reduc
tion of the many Inspections instituted to exclude American meats. The
only cloud at present on the horizon is due to the efforts being made by the
agrarian party to increase the imnort duties on all foreign meats. I under
stand there is correspondence in progress between the two Governments on
this point, though the State Department looks upon the proposed action as
concerning the internal affairs of the German kingdom. The proposition of
the agrarian party is being vigorously contested by the consumers, who
claim that the price of meat is too high; that the German supply is unequal
to meet the demand, and that duties on foreign meats should bo decreased
rather than increased. Should the Government press the bill providing for
the increase of cusMms in the Reichstag then there is every reason to be
lieve this Government will submit a statement complaining of such action.
Thore no question that Germany would prefer that tho United States did
not assume sovereignty over the Philippines, but such action having been
determined upon she has recognized the rights of this Government in the
archipelago.
DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN
CORDIAL RELATIONS
LONDON, Jan. 23.â The Berlin corre
spondent of the Times says: There are
good reasons for believing that the Ger
man Government regards the main-
tenance of cordial relations with Great
Britain and the United States as far
more important than even German
commc. Jial interests in Samoa. The
tone of the leading iournals. therefore,
is, on the whole, free from bitterness
or exaggeration.
In a word, there are many indications
that Germany will not frustrate a re
vision of the treaty of Berlin by ex
travagant demands such as. for in
stance, the cession of the islands to
Germany.
The Kolnische Zeitung ridicules the
report that Dr. yon Holleben. German
Embassador at Washington, has com
plained of Berry's remarks in the
House ft Representatives, and says
that the United States Embassador in
Berlin, Mr. White, might as well have
complained of Herr Ahlwardt's anti-
American ravings in the Reichstas:.
INTERESTS IN BOTH
OCEANS PROTECTED
NEW YORK, Jan. 22.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: As a re
sult of the assignment of the battle
ships lowa and Oregon to the Pacific
and Asiatic stations, respectively, and
the decision to dispatch the cruiser
Newark to the Pacific coast, the com
missioned naval force of the United
States is about equally divided between
tho two oceans.
At the present time there are sta
tion -d in Atlantic waters two battle
ships, two armored cruisers, one sec
ond-class battleship, six protected and
unprotected cruisers and twelve gun
boats. The combined commands of
Rear Admirals Dewey and Commodore
Kautz consists of two battleships, two
coast defense monitors, six cruisers, in
cluding the Newark, and sixteen gun
boats, which number all of the vessels
captured from Spain at Manila, three
of which are now undergoing repairs at
Hongkong. There are also a number
of auxiliary cruisers, colliers and sup
ply ships. The assignment of the New
ark to the Pacific is due to the neces
sity of having a cruiser on the Pacific
coast to replace the Philadelphia, which
will leave by Wednesday next for Sa
moa, orders having been given to push
work on the Newark bo that she may be
ready to sail early in February. The
auxiliary cruiser Badger, which has
been assigned to the Pacific station,
will leave Norfolk for Mare Island dur
ing the present week. The division of
the force is due to the desire of the
administration to protect its interests
in both oceans, though there Is no rea
son to believe that any further trouble
will occur.
BRITISH CRUISER
DISPATCHED TO SAMOA
WELLINGTON. N. Z., Jan. 22.â The
British third-class cruiser Royalist has
been dispatched to Samoa, following
the Tauranga, which left on Friday.
A BRIEF HISTORY
OF SAMOAN TROUBLE
Warships of three powers are being
hurried to Samoa. England and Ger
many have each a gunboat there al
ready. Three cruisers from England's
Australian squadron are on the way,
Germany is rounding up her fleet in
the Pacific and the battleship Oregon
will probably have another chance to
show her quality in a dash to Apia,
She is now about at Honolulu and the
chances are that the Iroquois, which
sails to-day for Hawaii, will carry her
Instructions to proceed to Samoa.
The cruiser Philadelphia is not in good
condition to make the journey, as she
was only sent to South America be
cause there was no other warship to
do the work. Before she can go on
another criuse she will probably have
to go on the drydock at Mare Island.
The trouble in Samoa is quite old. It
has bom brewing, with fiery ebulli
tions from time to time, ever since 1879,
In that year Sir Arthur Gordon, Brit
ish High Commissioner, established
Bialietoa King of the Islands of Samoa.
He was at once recognized as such by
the American and British Consuls.
Germany pursued a procrastinating
policy.
Whether the Germans wanted Malie
toa or not at that time was never
demonstrated, but they went to work
in an underhand manner and in 1884
the unfortunate King had become the
complete slave of the German mer
chants. The hitter were backed up by
their Government and Malietoa had to
do whatever they wished. He ap
pealed to the German Emperor in vain
and then besought Great Britain to an
nex the Islands. This brought about
his downfall. The Germans encour
aged Tamasese. a high chief, to rebel
and finally Malietoa was compelled to
flee from his capital.
Eventually he was persuaded to re
turn and give himself up. He was put
aboard a German man of -war and de
ported to New Guinea. Then Tam
asese was proclaimed King by the Ger
mans.
It was at this time that Mataafa first
came into prominence. He was one of
the principal high chiefs and dearly
beloved by his people. He endeared
himself to them still more by taking
up their cause and lighting the forces
of Tamasese and Germany.
It was during this war that a hurri
can swept over the harbor of Apia,
Seven men of war were at anchor in
the bay when the blast struck them.
The United States was represented by
the Vandalia. Trenton and Nipsic. All
were under the command of Rear Ad
miral Kimberly. The German fleet
wis composed of the Adler, Eber and
Olga. England's armored representa
tive was the Oaliope. Within one day
the winds destroyed the Adler and
Olga and piled in a mass of junk on
the beach the entire fleet of the United
States. The loss of life was appalling,
it being estimated that two hundred
men perished in the gale, and all on ac
count of this squabble for the Kingship
of an island.
Mataafa's war against the Germans
and Tamasese was a nagging and har
assing one. He fought from hills,
from ambush, from ravines and when
the Germans withdrew at last and
Tamasese could no longer successfully
battle for the crown, Mataafa was
chosen King by the people. Even
Malietoa, who had been brought back
from banishment, bowed to the wish of
the people and promised to be a faith
ful subject.
The calamity in the harbor of Apia
and the German reverses resulted in
the calling of the meeting of the three
powers â the United States, Great Brit
ain and Germany â in Berlin. A treaty
giving the people of Samoa the right to
choose their own form of government
and elect their own ruler, as soon as
peace and good order were established,
was signed and forwarded to the
islands.
Meanwhile the Consuls were instruct
ed to recognize Malietoa as King. When
this startling news was received Ma
taafa graciously resigned, being content
to await the result of the election,
which he and his followers had every
reason to believe would result in his
favor. On the arrival of the Chief Jus
tice and the president of the council
appointed by the powers, the natives
were informed that Malietoa Laupepa
was to remain King. This made the
natives mad and they took every means
of showing their disgust and openly
insulted Malietoa in the presence of the
Chief Justice.
Many thousands of the natives as-
Bembled at Malic (four and a half miles
from Apia) and there Mataafa joined
them. Since June, 1890, they have re
mained there waiting for the election
that, when it did come, resulted in the
crowning of Malietoa Tanu. Mataafa
did not care about the Kingship and
owing to his great influence with his
followers he was able to keep the peace
until this second slight was put upon
him by the powers.
Here is an extract from a letter writ
ten by H. J. Moors of Samoa to Secre
SPANISH SEAMEN
TAUGHT A LESSON
Special Cable to The Call and the New
York Herald. Copyrighted. 1599, by
James Gordon Bennett.
HAVANA. Jan. 22.â Captain
Eaton of the Resolute captured
a twenty-foot Spanish flag in the
harbor to-day and incidentally
taught thirty Spaniards a lesson
in manners. At 10 o'clock this
morning a Spanish schooner of
about seventy tons sailed along
side the Resolute, where it hove
to, and with a chee of defiance
from the thirty men aboard an
immense Fpanish flag was run
up to the masthead with the
Cuban flag beneath. Captain
Eaton was forced to recognize
the Insult, and ordered Cadet
Tarrant and Marine Officer
Thorp with a file of marines into
a steam launch, which speedily
overtook the Spaniard, captur
ing the schooner. The captain
refused to obey the order to
lower the flag, whereupon the
marines went aboard and took
forcible possession of the Span
ish flag, leaving the Cuban fly
ing. The occupants ol the
schooner were compelled to give
three cheers for the Cuban and
American flags, and then allowed
to go. The captured flag will be
held as a -rize.
tary of State Foster In the last days of
the Harrison administration that is as
applicable now as then:
"The people of Samoa read, In the
Berlin general act, that they have an
autonomous government and the right
to choose their own ruler. The country
will never be quiet until they have
made their choice. The tranquillity of
the island and the happiness of its peo
ple lie in an election and not in an
armed following of Malietoa, who at
one time bowed the knee, his knee, to
Mataafa and publicly recognized his
right to the crown. The natives are
willing to abide by the result of this
ballot, whether it be Mataafa or Malie
toa, but before paying another cent to
the present government this question
must be settled or the majority of the
natives will retire to the bush and fight
if necessary.
"The Samoans cannot be disarmed
by force or Mataafa deported without
a great loss of life, for they will fight
to the end. They have far more am
munition than is suspected and in the
bush they could not be followed by
white troops. After three or four years
of good government they could easily
be disarmed by their own authorities.
"I do not think that Mataafa has any
intention of making trouble or that he
personally cares to be King. I fear,
however, thai he will, even with his
influence, not always be able to keep
his men peaceful. The movement to
make him King of Samoa is a popular
one and I should be very sorry to see
the Government of the United States
take any part in enforcing an independ
ent people to submit to a ruler whom
they do not respect."
And now history is repeating itself.
In 1890 it was a struggle between Malie
toa Laupepa, Mateafa and Tamasese,
the former securing the Kingship by
the will of the powers, although Ma
taafa was the popular choice. In 1X99
Malietoa Laupepa is dead and the
struggle is between his sun, Malietoa
Tanu, Mataafa and Tamasese. Again
is Mataafa the choice of the natives
by an overwhelming majority, but
again the powers step in and Malietoa
Tanu is proclaimed King. And again
the warships of the three powers are
hurrying to the scene to back up their
choice. JOSEPH HANNA.

In the course of his report, upon
which the Fnrto Rican tariff is largely
based. Special Commissioner Porter
shows that the value of the importa
tions into Porto Rico during the year
1897 amounted to 17,358,063 pesos, upon
which was collected, in duties. $2,481,962.
He says:
The tariff in force in Porto Rico until
the United States took possession of the
island last summer was purely a revenue
measure, the total amount of duty col
lected averaging about 14 per cent on the
value of merchandise imported. These
values, both as to importations and duties
collected are given in silver and therefore
under existing conditionsâ two silver Por
to Rican pesos for one United States dol
larâmust be divided in order to express
the amounts in United States money. If
the same amount of revenue is required in
Porto Rican pesos and the exports are
likely to keep up to the ISP7 standard, the
fiscal problem confronting the Treasury
Department is briefly this: Probable total
value of dutiable imports, 17,538,063 pesos,
or $8 769 031; total revenue to be collected,
2,488.%2 pesos, or $1,240,981.
Discarding the money question, which,
after all, in this case is a purely Porto
Rican matter, the simple problem is an
importation of about $9,000,000 United
States money and a needed revenue of $1,
--23(i "<m> United States money. The aim in
framing the Cuban tariff was to secure
a revenue representing about 25 per cent
ad valorem of the imports. The aim has
been in the Porto Rican tariff to secure a
revenue representing about 15 per cent ad
valorem on all imports. â
The value of the Importations of mer
chandise into Cuba the last normal year

collected thereon $14,587,926, or an average

of nearly 25 per cent art valorem. On the
other hand the total value of imported
merchandise for Porto Rico in ISO 7. winch
so far as that island is concerned was a
normal year, was 17,358,063 pesos and the
duties collected 2,481,962 peso* "r an aver
age of about 14 per cent. The basis in the
case of Cuba wu practically gold and
Porto Rico silver, but mat makes no dif
ference in the relation of the tariff of one
country to the other. Speaking roundly,
the Cuban tariff yielded about 25 per cent
and the Porto Riean say about IS per cent.
It would lie manifestly unjust to Porto
Rico to adopt and put in force the
amended Cuban tariff, because it is be
lieved the Cuban revenue will amount to
about 25 per cent of the imports, while a
15 per cent ad valorem tariff, assuming
that the imports keep up to those of I^'T.
will yield sufficient revenue for the gov
ernmental needs of Porto Rico. The nec
essities and wants of the two countries
are radically different. Porto Rico has
not been devastated by war nor will it
require a large I'nited States army to
keep order. There are no armed insur
gents demanding millions for payment of
military services to be charged up to
the customs receipts. For these and
other reasons the amended tariff for
Porto Rico has been framed on a revenue
yielding basis of 15 per cent Instead of
25 per cent, as in the case of the amended
tariff of Cuba. By this it must not be in
ferred that all the schedules will be uni
formly 15 per cent. The schedules relat
ing to wool and manufactures of; silk
and manufactures of and musical instru
ments have been increased to 25 per cent
ad valorem. The rates of the liquor
schedule will exceed 25 per cent and is
practically the same as in the Cuban
schedule. An endeavor has been mad.' to
keep cotton and manufactures of below
15 per cent, only the finer grades at the
higher rate, and all the coarser goods of
general consumption have been placed at
li) per cent ad valorem. The machinery
to be used in extending transportation
and advancing the industries of the island
has ben put at 15 per cent or its equiva
lent. About 18 per cent ad valorem has
heretofore been collected on the imports
of the metal schedule and it is probable
that the proposed rates will keep within
this proportion. Here and there a few
changes have been made, as will be seen
by reference to J/ie several schedules whicti
follow, but the changes have all been dic
tated by the desire to make the revenue
tariff less burdensome on articles of food
than on articles which are consumed by
those better able to pay. The general re
sult will be a tariff not dissimilar to that
of Jamaica, which averages about 12 T 2 per
cent duty, but which is now undergoing
revision by a committee, and which tariff
your comissioner was informed when in
Kingston will average, after the revision
completed, about 16 2-3 per cent.
As has been said, the revenue producing
schedule on the Porto Rico tariff, as in the
Cuban tariff, is that relating to provi
sions. The Spanish policy seems to have
been seven per cent for manufactures of
cotton, 12 per cent for manufactures eff
silk, 10 per cent for manufactures of wool,
9 per cent for machinery. 2 per cent for
special imports, but 20 per cent on ali
mentary substances. There would seem to
be two reasons for this, the first being
that the people in a climate like Porto
Rico can do without almost anything but
food; the second, that as most of the food
products were imported Into Porto Rico
from the United States, Spain herself took
little interest in the rates of duty. Indeel,
of the total amount of duties paid as abov.
nearly $950,000 were paid by the United
States largely on food products. In mak
ing up the Porto Rico tariff, Spain ar
ranged the schedules so adroitly in favor
of her own interests that between the
goods placed at a high rate of duty com
ing from countries other than Spain, and
the commodities placed at a low rate of
duty, on the free list, when Imported into
Porto Rico from Spain, she escaped al
most altogether the payment of duty.
Spain, according to Dr. Carroll, furnished
over 40 per cent in value of the imports,
and paid less than 4 per cent of the cus
toms collected; the United States fur
nished 21 per cent of the value of the im
ports and paid 38 per cent of the customs
collected. As Spanish imports now pay
duties at the same rates as those from
other countries an Increase of revenue
may fairly be expected in the schedules
which Spain reserved for herself.
If the amount of this increase could be
estimated it would be possible to consid
erably reduce the rates of duty on food
stuffs, but to do so without knowing ex
actly the amount of revenue it may be
possible to obtain from the other sched
ules would be a dangerous experiment.
AIMED AT THE SMELTERS.
Shanahan of Shasta Projects a Legis-
lative Enactment.
REDDING. Jan. 22.â 1t is asserted here
that Code Commissioner Shanahan will
endeavor to have passed by the Legisla
ture a bill aimed at the operations of the
Mountain Copper Company at Keswick.
A great volume of smoke and fumes is
thrown off by the smelters and roasters
of this concern, and it is affirmed that
the smoke and poisonous gases are in
luring many orchards for miles down the
Sacramento River. Shanahan is the owner
of a large prune orchard near Anderson,
twelve miles south of Redding. He as
serts that his trees have been damaged
and his crop considerably reduced.
If such a measure is introduced in the
Legislature it will be fought by practi
cally t)\e entire business interests of the
county. Copper smelting has raised
Shasta County to the first rank among
the mineral producing counties of the
State, and a blow at the great industry
will be considered as an attack on the
most interests of the commonwealth.

pose are not subject to the tax upon lega
cies arising: from personal property. In
case the debts and claims against the es
tate exceed the appraised or clear value
of the personal property, he says, there
can be no legacy tax.

WHAT ThjE FIGURES SHOW.
TRADE conditions appear about the same as for
several weeks. In the Eastern States, we are
told that business is lively, as shown by the
bank clearings, which last week were 40.8 per cent
larger than fur the same week in 1898. If these
figures show anything it is that trade is over 40 per
cent better this year than last. But there is a joker in
this that is apt to l>e overlooked. (Jut of a total of
$1,996,000,000 clearings for the week those of New
York City were $1,346,000,000, or two-thirds of the
total; and as the vast transactions of Wall street make
up a large percentage- if this $i.,}40.000.000 it will readily
be seen that speculation, and not trading in mer
chandise, creates most of these clearings and there
fore most of the gain. Hence business may really be
quiet all over the country, but if there is a booming
slock market in New York the bank clearings may
fictitiously show a lively state of ordinary trade.
i!ut there is an offset to this. If the other cities of
the country, where stock speculation plays second
â¢fiddle, also, show a large gain, it is reasonable to in
fer that business is really better. This is the condi
tian at present. Last week only two important
citiesâ Kansas City and New Orleans â showed a loss
in bank clearings, and the dozen principal cities ex
hibited an increase ranging from 12 per cent to 53
per cent. From this showing, therefore, there is
actually a great improvement in business throughout
the country. In fact, it is undeniable that the foreign
trade of the country is far ahead of anything ever be
fore known, and the European balance in our favor
is continually growing. That the iron trade is still
having an immense boom is shown by the fact that
many mills, when sent orders, name prohibitory
prices in order to scare off this new business, or posi
tively refuse to accept it on any terms for want of
capacity. Surely this is the pinnacle of commercial
activity. The number of these works is rapidly in
creasing, as the remarkable demand for material
covers many months' capacity.
The other great staples continue in fair shape.
Lumber is reported firm almost everywhere, and
[.rices for several descriptions are advancing. The
exports of wheat are a fraction under those of last
year, but it , must be remembered that they were
phenomenally large in iBqB. Wool is also behind 1898
in point of movement, but the clouded situation in
this staple is slowly Clearing. Hides and leather and
hoots and shoes are reported in satisfactory condi
tion, and prices for the former are firm. The cotton
trade is better than last year, and the tendency in
prices is somewhat upward, with increasing attention
being paid to the market. All these indications are
.favorable, and are accentuated by the continued de
crease in failures, those of last week being 262,
against 309 for the corresponding week in 1898.
In California there are lew new features worthy of
note. The rain has come and pone and left in its
wake general confidence and cheerfulness. The farm
ers are busy putting in what promises to be one of
the largest cereal crops ever harvested, and with the
usual rains from now on present anticipations will
doubtless be realized- Scanty stocks of everything
all over the State promise large returns for this com
. ing crop,, and with this prospect in view there is a
disposition to expand in all lines of business. In
fact, the State never looked better than it does to-day.
Money is much more accessible than it has been for a
twelvemonth, failures are few and small and the situa
tion is one of comparative ease all around.
While the entente cordiale between England and
America is doubtless in good working order, it has
not reached the point at which McKinley can appoint
a British subject Governor of the Philippines, as has
been intelligently suggested from London. When
such a point has been reached he will elect the Prince
of Wales to the Presidency.
A ball-player hasjust been sentenced to seven years'
imprisonment for stealing something beside bases
mk! sliding to homes when a policeman happened to
be acting as umpire.
. There must be great indignation in Nevada. Think
of the disgrace involved in the sale of a vote for $50.
No California!! legislator has ever been accused of
stich a crime.
Colonel Berry of the late Seventh California has
1 a balance to the Red Cross people, but he
will never be accused of having exercised undue haste
hi the matter.
It is a shameful thing that a lack of funds should
cause the closing of any school, and still more shame
ful because none of the rogues who wasted the funds
are in jail.
While there can never be pleasure in agreeing with
Croker, when he says that 16 to I is a dead issue there
seems no way to avoid doing so.
THE SPIDER OND HIS PARLOR.
WITH the cunning craft of a spider, Dan Burns
has been weaving a mesh in which he hopes
to ensnare a sufficient number of legislators
to bring about his election to the United States
Senate. To the snare which' he is contriving he gives
the high-sounding title of Republican caucus, and
hopes by the attractiveness of the name to delude the
unwary into his power.
It is the old story of the spider and the fly, and a
more venomous spider, even among the tarantulas of
Mexico, never existed than the one who is now work
ing in secret at Sacramento, alternately cajoling
honest men to trust to his promises and fuming with
rage because he is met everywhere by reminders that
his record is not one that creates confidence.
Honest Republicans who go into a caucus with the j
Burns gang may as well leave hope behind. That j
underhand worker and secret schemer, who kept ;
his intrigues for the Senatorship in the background, J
hidden from the people, during the campaign; and j
who has all along been allied with such tricksters as J
the exposed Wright, would not favor a caucus if he j
had not already arranged for its management and j
control. In the parlor of the spider there is always a
trap door that leads to a slaughter pen.
The Senatorial contest should be continued in the
open. So many scandals have been brought to light
that a resort to secrecy now would raise suspicions even
against the innocent. It is asserted tha^t Burns has a few
weak rascals in the Legislature who would like to vote j
for him, but dare not do so unless a caucus affords them
something like an excuse. That excuse should not !
be given. So long as the contest is carried on in the
full light of publicity, honesty has nothing to fear, but ,
in the darkness the advantage will be with dishonesty, i
The issue ought to be settled before the close of this
week. The people who would have been wearied by
so protracted a controversy under any circum
stances have been thoroughly disgusted by the
amount of corruption The Call has disclosed and the
investigating committee has confirmed by evidence
obtained from the accused parties themselves. The
public des^e now is that the Senatorial issue be deter
mined promptly by the election of an honest man,
and that the investigation committee go on with its
work until every bribe-taker is exposed and corrup
tion traced to its source.
The spider has worked in the dark, but light has
already fallen upon a portion of his web and it re
quires no great brilliancy of eyesight to see where
the threads lead. It is safe to say Speaker Wright
did not go into the Burns parlor for nothing. It is
equally safe to say Burns will do everything in his
power to get a whitewashing report from the investi
gating committee. That he may accomplish the two
dirty tasks of renovating the reputation of Wright
and procuring his own election to the Senate, he is
desirous of having a secret caucus. The Mexican
tarantula has spread the mesh and whoever goes into
it is a fool.
FOREST PLANTING IN MINNESOTA.
nIXXESOTA is one of the States that was be
lieved by its early settlers to have "inex
haustible forests." Accordingly they cut
the timber recklessly, let fires ravage it and wasted it
in every way that human carelessness and negligence
can do. Minnesota is still a young State. Hardly a
single generation has passed away since the first
pioneers began to chop wood and start forest fires
within her borders, and yet she is to-day consider
ing what she can do to restore the trees to large
areas of land from which they have been swept
away.
The State at present makes provision for the su
pervision of the forests by an official bearing the sig
nificant title of State Fire Warden, thus showing that
his chief duty is to fight fire. Protection for the re
maining forests, however, is not enough, and re
cently there was obtained from Dr. C. A. Schenck,
formerly official Assessor of Forests in Hesse-
Darmstadt, but now superintendent of George Van
dcrbilt's estate at Biltmore, a plan for reforesting a
large area of the State with a detailed estimate of the
probable cost and the profits likely to ensue.
From a review of his report given by the St. Paul
Pioneer Press it appears there are 5,000,000 acres of
vacant land in Minnesota, which includes land that
has been cut over as well as land regarded as un
suited to agriculture. Of that amount it is estimated
that at least 2,000,000 acres could be well and profit
ably replanted with forests. As a good portion of
the area has already been forfeited to the State for
taxes, and the rest is virtually abandoned, it is be
! lieved the whole 2,000,000 acres could be purchased at
an average of 25 cents an acre. The further estimates
are given as follows:
The cost of planting- per acre, with pine, is esti
mated at $11 2r>; adding which to the cost of the
land makes a total of $11 50. Added to this must be
the loss of taxes, the cost of protection and admin
istration, which, assuming the two million acres to
be acquired gradually, are estimated at $50,000 per
annum. The various items of expenditure, dis
tributed over a period of eighty years, are thus seen
to foot up as fellows:
Cost of land, 2,000,000 acres at 25 cents per
acre $300,000
Expense for planting 25,000 acres per year,
at $11 25 per acre, $281,250, or in eighty
years 22,500,000
Taxes, protection and administration, $50,
--000 per year for eighty years 4,000,000
Total $27,000,000
When to that sum is added interest on the money
expended during the eighty years, it is calculated the
reforesting of 2,000,000 acres will cost Minnesota the
sum of $42,400,000. That is a very heavy fine to pay
for the neglect to take care of the forests in the first
place. The penalty, however, will not have been paid
in vain, for it is estimated that at the end of eighty
years the land will be covered with timber averag
ing 12,000 feet board measure to the acre, worth in
the aggregate $72,500,000 at present prices, and ca
pable of yielding to the State a yearly revenue of
many millions of dollars.
The moral for California to draw from these esti
mates furnished to Minnesota is that an ounce of pre
vention is worth a pound of cure, and that it would
be a great deal better for her to preserve the forests
she has than to let them burn and then replant the
land at a cost of millions and wait for years to get a
return.
A LONG FIGHT FOR JUSTICE.
' H; X -SENATOR EDMUNDS in the hearing be
fore the Senate Committee on Commerce stated
* that during his public career he had been en
gaged for twenty-five years in trying to procure the
enactment of legislation that would serve to protect
and promote our merchant marine. The statement
serves to recall popular attention to the long period in
which earnest and able statesmen have been trying to
do this justice to our shipowners and sailors, but
have been baffled by the opposition forces.
An accurate and comprehensive account of the
means by which all efforts toward legislation favor
able to our merchant marine have been defeated,
would be interesting and instructive, but it is doubt
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1899.
ful if it would form in our history a chapter to be
proud of. The opposition to American ship-building
has been more or less secret, but it has always been
effective. After fighting for such a measure for
twenty-five years of an active and vigorous political
career, Mr. Edmunds in his retirement stiil sees the
desired legislation postponed and our merchant
marine unprotected.
Fortunately the prospects are that the long battle is
about to be won. The demand for protection to our
shipping interests is now widespread, persistent and
emphatic. It comes from State Legislatures, from
the press, from commercial and industrial organiza
tions of all kinds, and Congress can no longer
ignore it.
In fact, the expansion of our commerce by reason of
the growth of our export trade has been so great of late
that an increase in our shipping business has become
a necessity of the time. We need ships to carry on our
commerce, and we cannot with safety rely upon ships
of other nations. As Mr. Edmunds himself pointed
out, if any two of the great commercial nations who
are now carrying our goods for us should go to war,
we would be left in the lurch, and until we could build
ships of our own the results would be disastrous.
These economic considerations are having their ef
fect. Many persons who ignored the justice of the
claims of our ship-builders, ship-owners and sailors,
are keenly alive to the importance of providing the
nation with ample shipping now that the necessity of
it is so apparent. There still remain some inveterate
free traders who insist that the best way to build up
a merchant marine is to permit the granting of Amer
ican registers to foreign-built ships. Fortunately the
number of these men is not large. The great ma
jority of the people desire to have our merchant ves
sels built in our own ship-yards and by our own labor.
It has been demonstrated that we are excelled as
ship-builders by no people in the world. It is im
possible, however, for our shipping companies or our
builders to compete with the heavily subsidized lines
cf European nations. It is full time therefore that
the long contest for justice should be bi ought to an
end. The present Congress will add much to the
luster of its record and the value of its services to the
country if it enacts a well devised shipping bill before
it adjourns.
IMPERIAL colonization, or in its concrete form,
territorial expansion in Asia, is deeper than party
and touches the foundation of the Government.
It is hardly possible that it should become a political
L-pue between parties, notwithstanding the strenuous
efforts of Mr. Bryan to deprive it of its patriotic dig
nity. Therefore, having maintained a uniform and
uncompromising attitude against this treacherous ef
fort to revolutionize our institutions, it is gratifying to
The Call to observe that, on the substantial proposi
tion, Senators White and Perkins, though elected by
opposing parties, are in accord. But there, for the
time at least, the resemblance between them ceases.
Senator White stands by his own convictions. Sena
tor Perkins expresses similar opinions, but proposes,
by his vote, to obey the conflicting instructions of our
State Legislature and indorse the treaty of Paris with
out amendment.
Believing, as we do, in the conscientious desire
of Senator Perkins to do right and respecting his
deference to the .will of the people, when properly
formulated and expressed, we are nevertheless con
vinced that, upon reconsideration, he will find that his
judgment and his vote ought to correspond. He has
certainly misconceived the extent and the application
of the doctrine that a State Legislature has the right
to instruct Federal Senators. Representatives are
elected by the people in Congressional districts, and,
as to them, there has never been a pretense that they
could be governed by legislative direction. They
are simply "requested" to vote in conformity with
legislative suggestion. But, within proper limits, it
has been recognized that the right to instruct Federal
Senators exists and that they should either obey or re
sign. Senator Perkins has accepted the doctrine
without observing its limitations. In one aspect he
represents the restricted sovereignty of the State of
California and his immediate constituency is the
Legislature, but, in another sense, he is a Senator of
the United States with the Nation for his constitu
ency, and beyond any State or legislative jurisdiction
whatever. On those questions arising in the Senate
of the United States, which affect exclusively the local
interests of the State, he is traditionally bound to fol
low legislative instructions or vacate his seat. But
the affairs of the Nation, matters relating to constitu
tional interpretation or to our intercourse with for
eign powers, issues of peace or of war, every subject
within the scope of Congressional action in which the
entire people of the country are equally interested, are
beyond the powers of any State Legislature, and in
relation to them an instruction is a plain usurpation.
In respect to the proposed acquisition and reten
tion of the Philippines, Senator Perkins represents
forty-five States and all their inhabitants. He is not
an agent of the State, employed merely to record its
legislative decrees on subjects of Federal cognizance,
but a statesman, chosen to protect the special interests
of the State, but independently to employ his intel
lect, his knowledge and his broad patriotism for the
equal benefit of seventy-five millions of people, who
rely for the preservation and the development of
American institutions and American civilization upon
the Federal Government, adriiinistered under the
Constitution.
This is the broad and the accurate view, conforming
to our political system, of the relation between a
Senator of the United States and the republic. Any
other construction of his duties and of his obligations
would reduce him to the insignificance of a legislative
clerk. The disgraceful struggle now proceeding at
Sacramento and the moral and intellectual degrada
tion of the two leading candidates convey no true
idea of the proportions to which an American states
man is expected to attain when he reaches the Senate
of the United States. We may love the common
wealth in which we live, but we must not imagine
that the State of California is the United States of
America. The proposition is unanswerable that, on
national issues, Mr. Perkins is a Senator of the
United States, and that, in that capacity, his allegiance
is due to the nation and not to a majority in a State
Legislature. It is his brains, his sagacityi his inde
pendent and manly action, and not blind subserviency
to a void resolution of instruction, that the Union
demands at his hands. If in his opinion territorial
expansion in Asia is inconsistent with our institu
tions, then he should express and vote that opinion,
for the. benefit of forty-five States, held together in
indissoluble unity.
Senator Perkins, without a legislative instruction,
and in the face of the last preceding action of the
Legislature, voted for the annexation of Hawaii, in
response to what he conceived to be the public senti
ment in this State. We differed from him then, but
respected his evident desire to keep the Government
under popular control. We hope now that he may
take that broader view of the broader question before
him, that will lead him to display before the world
the august figure of a national Senator, true to him
self, true to his country and true to mankind.

RANCH AND RURAL LIFE.
Many dairymen in this State have objected to the measures necessary
to stamp out tuberculosis in their herds. The only way to do it is to kill
all infected animals and cremate their carcasses. In England this has be
come a serious matter, and the interest in it is shown by a recent meet
ing in Marlborough House, where the Prince 'of Wales presided and Lord
Salisbury and Lord Rosebery made addresses, and the Prince of Wales re
ported that the Queen had ordered the entire extermination of one of her
dairy herds, in which the disease had appeared.
The Livestock Commissioners of Illinois report that experiments carried
on at Rockford prove that cattle infected by Texas fever, if dipped in dy
namo oil and sulphur, become incapable of communicating the disease to
healthy stock.
The breeding of poultry in California presents some of the same dif
ficulties that beset fruit culture. The clement climate which makes fruit
trees great, precocious and prolonged bearers also promotes the life of par
asites which sting and bore and suck to the exhaustion of vitality and the
injury of the crop. So in poultry, mites and parasites, minute and appar
ent, require of the breeder constant vigilance. But there awaits for his care
the same reward which the fruit gruwer gets, of great profit if he is watch
ful. Too much shelter is given 'to poultry here rather than too little. Close
quarters breed insect enemies that would not appear if there were more ex
posure to the weather and the open air.
It costs as much to feed a poor cow as a good one, and the profits
of proper feeding of a good cow are greatly above those when she is poor
ly fed. In Eastern creameries this is demonstrated. A good cow prop
erly and well fed will yield $55 a year income; when poorly fed she pro
duces only $18.
At Clovis, in Madera County, is one wheatfleld of forty square miles, .
It Is put in by Mr. Clovis Cole, who employed in the plowing and seeding
200 men and 1000 horses and mules. It is so level that the whole of it can
be seen from one point of view, and it should be an object of interest to
Eastern visitors, for it is probably the largest unbroken wheatfleld now
growing on the planet.
The greatest mushroom crop in the Union grows in California. The latÂ»
rains have produced tons of this valuable fungus. The Agaricus Conpes
tris, the best variety, is in evidence everywhere. It is strange that we
import dried mushrooms from China and mushroom catsup from England
when the raw material goes to waste at home.
Cloverdale citrus fair will be held in February.
The Sebastopol Cannery last week shipped a carload of canned fruit tÂ«
New Zealand, one to New York and one to TV'est Virginia.
The Sebastopol Times says that Mr. Gallagher of that place embarked
in dairying at Bodega last year with ninety cows, selling his milk to the
Bodega Creamery, and notwithstanding the dry and unfavorable year pros
pered and made money.
The apple and pear growers have an enemy in the codlin moth Its
eggs are deposited in the blossom end of the fruit when it is small" and
that end is turned up. Then is the time to spray with an insecticide for
it reaches the egg and kills it. After the fruit has grown and the blossom
end is turned down, it is useless to spray, for the remedy does not reach
the egg. Apple men in Oregon complain that their export last year was
shortened by a thousand carloads by this moth.
The rain has started all sorts of farm, orchard and vineyard work all
over the State, and preparations for planting, pruning, plowine and SPP fI

was over the lieutenants in command
were decorated for their good work. The
boats had no regular engineers, skilled
machinists serving instead.

eleven hawsers, each with a strain of 350

with six hawsers was located directly
over the battleship, and the lifting and
canting process began, and on July 13
last the Gangoot was righted to within 37
degrees. Further righting was effected
by undermining the bottom by means of
compressed air and thus rignti'ng the ves
sel at a rate of 2% degrees per week. The
Gangoot now stands upright and the next
step will be to pump air into the hold and
with the aid of the pontoons bring her
afloat.

TO EXEMPT CHURCH PROPERTY
Rev. Dr. Locke Favors the Proposed
Amendment to the Consti
tution.
Dr. Charles Edward Locke's subject at
the Central Methdist Episcopal Church
last evening was, "Should the Great State
of California Tax Houses of Worship?"
The text was Acts viii:3â "As for Saul,
he made havoc of the church." He spoke
as follows:
"The proposition which I wish to dis
cuss to-night 1s the exemption from taxa
tion of houses of worship and the sites
which they occupy. Our contention is not
for the exemption of all property which
belongs to church corporations, but for
such property as is not income-producing.
All property held by the church for in
vestment and all property from which
revenues are received in our judgment
should be taxable.
"Houses of worship should remain un- i
taxed because this is a Christian nation. |
The Sabbath is honored in the law, the i
Bible is recognized in the courts, prayer j
is offered in Congress and the name of j
God is on our coins. One in four of the '
populaton is a church member, and,
probably, one in two is an attendant of
and sympathizer with the church.
"The church should not be taxed be
cause the church is for the people; is sup
ported by the voluntary offerings of the j
] people. It is not a means of temporal !
I gain to its members. They willingly share j
I in the support of the church because of !
| the ennobling influences which are exerted i
by the church. To tax church property
for which members have willingly al- |
ready taxed themselves is a tax on a tax,
and thus outrages the fundamental prin- \
ciple of taxation. Then, too, it must
< v. rywhere be recognized that attractive i
church architecture is an adornment to i
any city; it enhances the value of con
tlguous property, makes a city more de- !
sirable for homes and is an important ad-
Junct to all educational forces operating !
for the refinement and elevation of our
citizenship. A handsome structure con
tributes to the liberal education of our
people, and particularly if such a build
ing is monumental to the loftiest impulses
of those who have cheerfully contributed j
toward its erection.
"Again, the church Is for the public [
poodâpro bono publico. It Btanaa for
obedience to law, respect for the author- j
ities, and good order. It is the exponent
of the ten commandments, and in propor
tlon to its growth and support lessens the
prison and asylum population. It is
against all criminality, and seeks the
transformation of the lives of those who j
would otherwise become a burden on I
an already overtaxed people.
"The church is a conservator of morals; '
an inculcator of reverence. The State
needs these high moral influences and
should exempt houses of worship from
taxation not for the church's sake but for :
the sake of the State. It would be a just
recognition of the invaluable service ren
dered by the church if the State should
decline to accept a tax from the church, j
California is the only State which taxes
church property. Surely our citizenship
cannot occupy a very defensible position j
as the ignoble exception in the sisterhood
of States. It is certain that with our Sab
bath-breaklng people, our race track !
gambling and bribe-taking politicians, and j
our vast product of criminals, there is !
evidence that much needs to be done for j
the moral and religious elevation of our â 
Btate.
"The church is a citadel of manliness.
It is a great common school, where hon- i
esty, chastity, temperance, the home, the ;
Sabbath, personal honor â in short, char- j
acterâ is emphasized as the principal â 
thing. Do we need men in California? \
Let 'Wantedâ Men' be hung in large let
tera upon the assembly halls at Sacra
mento. Alas! I? it possible that the '
State's most honorable offices are to go
begging for want of truly great men? It j
is certain that old Diogenes, with his
lighted torch, would not have an easy j
task in the Capital City.
"For these and many other reasons we !
submit that the time has come for the
present Assembly to grant to the people
an opportunity to amend our constitution
and exempt from burdensome taxation an
institution which in a thousand particu- i
lars Is an indescribable good to our citi
zenship."
At the conclusion of his permnn Dr.
Locke read the proposed" amendment,
which is as follows:
"Section U 2 . All buildings used exclu-'
sively as church and chapels, and the real j
property on which they are situated,
shall be free from taxation.
On this proposed amendment he called
for a rising vote of such members of the
congregation as favored his signing the
petition, which was sent to him represent
ing his church on the subject. The vote
in favor of his doing so was unanimous

1-IVB SUNDAYS IN FEBRUARYâ E.,
City. The Department of Answers to
Correspondents has been furnished the
following in answer to tne question "How
often does February have five Sundays
and when will it next occur?" There were
five Sundays in February in 1524, 1852 and
ISSO. There will be live in 1920, 194S and
1976. This occurs during the century
once in twenty-eight years, which Is a
solar cycle. It occurred in the years giv
en, but prior to 1824 it was forty years'
space or 17&4. The same number will
intervene from the year ISSO, so the next
date for the occurrence will be 1920. The
reason that it will not occur in 1908 is
that the year 1900 is not a leap year. It
will be noticed that all the years in which
it has occurred or will occur the domini
cal letters are D. C. and 1900 not being a
leap year uses only one letter. This
causes' the letters to spread, and It will
take until 1920 before D. C. comes In for
leap year. From that time on It will
run through two centuries without inter
ruption, once in twenty-eight years, be
cause the ypar 2*XtO will be :i Â»Â«TÂ»'n vÂ«ar.
So it will take until the year 2100 before
the solar system is disturbed again. Then
the forty years will be rbpeated. The Itn
of March for the inauguration of the
President and Vice President of the Uni
ted States occurs on Sunday precisely in
the* same order.

NEXT CENTURY
TO THE SAVIOR
Services Held at St.
Ignatius Church.
SERMO* BY FATHER WOODS
SOLEMN HOMAGE TO BE PAID TO
THE LORD CHRIST.
The Project of a Universal Expression
of Religious Feeling Is Fully
Approved by the
Pope.
Impressive services were held last night
et St. Ignatius Church in accordance with
the recommendation of an international
committee, with Cardinal Jacobin! at its
head, organized to bring about, "the
solemn consecration of the coming cen
tury to Jesus Christ, our Savior and King,
by the whole Catholic world." Pope Leo
XIII fully approves the project, and
agrees with representative men that there
should be a solemn and universal expres
sion of religious feeling in connection
therewith.
This solemn homage will take the form
of services of more than ordinary solem
nity in all the churches throughout the
world, and the fourth Sunday of the
month has been specially set aside In St.
Ignatius with that sacred object in view.
Solemn benediction was held and d-le
gates from the Gentlemens', Ladies' and
Students' sodalities and the League of the
Sacred Heart were present, wearing their
distinguishing badges.
Rev. Father H. J. Woods preached the
eermon on the subject "Christ's Claim
Upon Us as Our Creator." He introduced
his remarks by explaining the objects of
the work In whii-h the whole Catholic
world is now engaged. "No one," hÂ»; said,
"ever before heard of the consecration of
a century, why then should we be prepar
ing ourselves to consecrate the coming
century to Christ?" The world is divided
Into two campsâ the camp of Christ and
the camp of anti-Christ. Between the two
there is an unceasing war, and believers
of the latter think they have gained such
advantages as will bring about the speedy
ruin of the cause of Christ. They have
taken the city of the Popes and made It
one of their own capitals. Governments
are in a great measure in their hands and
education by which they form the minds
of the rising generation. Why, then.should
they .not triumph and that speedily? In
this anticipation they claim the twentieth
century as their own, not merely the
days, weeks, months and years, but the
actions that will till them, the energies
of the men who will live in them.
"We Bee now why Catholics are uniting
:to consecrate the coming century to
Christ. If their enemies hope for triumph
It belongs to them under God to frustrate
that triumph. If their enemies are brac
ing themselves to action they must actu
ate all their own energies in opposition.
We are not consecrating the mere suc
cession of time to Christ, for that is his
already. We are consecrating our ener
},,.â¢>:. our activities, our zeal and that of
cur children and of their children yet un
born, to the cause of God, of his church
and of its king, Christ Jesus, the incar
nate word by whom all things were made,
in whom by divine decree all things con-
Fist, that in all things he may have the
primacy."
The International Council points out
that as this solemn homage is* an act of
Christian faith, an essential part of the
preparation for it is an increasing of our
of Christ, and it indi
three means of obtaining this in
og, prayer and pilgrimage.
As uniformity in the use of these means
is desirable, his Grace Archbishop Rior
dan has offered the following practical
suggestions:
Sunday evening in every month
will be set apart in the churches on which
will b< I a special sermon directed
to the work of preparation. A form of
prayer has been issued in this connection
to be used during benediction. Sodalities
and other societies of a spiritual charac
ter should attend the services under the
leadership of their officers. Particular
pains should be taken to prepare the
young for this great act, and a ceremony

The address was delivered by Rev. Her
j man L. Duhring of Philadelphia, and was
an informal but instructive history of the
Episcopal missions throughout the coun
try. ' Statistics showing the relative
! .^trensth of other Sunday schools were
cited, and proved an interesting los.son. j
The life of the Sunday-school teacher was
eulogized and the noble character of the |
teacher of the rising generation was j
placed before that of all other women in j
the world.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1899.
WAS THE BRIDE OF
AN ARAB ACROBAT
Romance in the Life of the Missing Mrs.
Gale.
*T*HE whereabouts of Mrs. Julia Gale, wife of Charles Gale, 216% Sixth
street, whose disappearance was reported in yesterday's Call, Is still
shrouded in mystery. Neither Detective Anthony nor her husband can
obtain the slightest clew to her whereabouts. What makes her dis
appearance all the more perplexing is the fact that she did not take her
jewelry nor the $70 that was in her trunk. She took with her the key of the
trunk and the key of the door. Besides
she. wore only a plain black skirt, a
blue and white striped waist and a
cloth jacket, and left all her best
clothes in her trunk. Gale does not
believe there is another man in the
case, but the police are inclined to be
lieve that she has deserted him and
gone East. She received a letter last
Friday, and it might have contained
money. She did not tell her husband
anything about the letter, and he
learned of it from the landlady.
There is a bit of romance attached
to Mrs. Gale's life. Her maiden name
was Julia Doyle, and she came to New
York from Ireland while a young girl
to join her sister, a soubrette, whose
stage name was Josie Williams. After
retiring from the stage Josie started
a boarding house for theatrical people,
and there Julia met Hadji Tahar, an
Arabian juggler and acrobat. They
wore married, and she traveled with
him. He was with Sells* circus when
it came here six or seven years ago,
and went with the circus to Australia.
He left her here stranded with her
baby girl, May, and she obtained a di
vorce from him on the ground of de
sertion. Gale married her while she
was employed in the St. Ann's build
ing, on November 9. 1593. Sic Hassen
Ben Ali, manager of the Tow-Zoon-In
Arab acrobats, with the female spin
ningtop that appeared at the Orpheum about two months ago, used to be
Hadji's 'partner and while here he took a fancy to little May. who is now 9
years of age and got her mother to enter into a contract with him, giving him
'â¢>]â '.â  i ustody 'of May for irs, so that he could train her for the stage.
The little girl was sent East, but ncr father, learning of the contract, took
a of her, and the matter was taken into the courts in New York.
Judge Daly decided that the father was not a proper custodian for the child
and ordered her into the care and custody of her aunt, Josie, who had mar
ried a wealthy New Yorker. The marriage of Julia to H.idjl was the cause
of an estrangement between the two sisters, but the police think that a re
conciliation has been effected through the little girl, and that Josie has sent
Julia money to take her to New York and desert Gale. ,_...â.
Mr< Gale is a little woman, 2fi years of age. a blonde, of stout build, and
attractive in her manners and appearance. She is about 5 feet 4 Inches tall.

GOLF LEADS TENNIS.
The Players of the Scottish Game
Welcome the Arrival of Sunny-
Days.
From the beginning of the new year un
til b few <lays ago golfing was rendered
almost impossible by the rain. On Tues
day afternoon, however, tour ladies com
peted for the Winslow medal on the Pre-
Sidid links. Miss Ella Wilcox Morgan win
ning from scratch with a score of 161.
Miss M. B. Houghton, who won the com
petition for the modal in December, also
played from scratch, and was second,
with a score of 169. So small a field as
four for a handicap event, open only to
ladies, seems to show that there is not
much enthusiasm among the lady mem
bers of the San Francisco Golf Club, of
whom ther&arfl Beventy-flve. But perhaps
when the weather becomes more settled,
the afternoons lighter and the new club
house, with its conveniences, is ready for
use. more </f the ladies will put tr/jn
ln evidence, on the links. .-'h
.N'-xt Saturday, January 2S, ,/pre
will be mixed foursomes, at p.Wfljteen
holes, match play, with handleaHSrDur-
Ing the last few days j. w. Byrne, 11. D.
I'illsbury and others have been out for
practice. The directors of the Oakland
Golf Club are preparing: the details of a
Hub tournament to be held at an early
date, and certain improvements are being
carried out on the course. The distance
to the first hole, which Is now 200 yards,
will be increased to 4'2~> yards, and the dis
tance from the second to the third hole,
which is at present 100 yards, will be
lengthened to 500 yards. The distance be
tween the third and fourth holes, which
Is now 2:*7 yards, will be increased a lit
tle, and the approach rendered more dif
ficult; the hole will be on the top of a
small knoll. The bogey score for hole No.
3 is given as two, but this Is scarcely cor
rect, as no player can be sure of driving
his ball so accurately on to the putting
green as to hole out on his second shot.
In fact, if a man reaches the green In two
shots and holes out In two more he is
playing good, steady golf. The Oakland
course, after the above mentioned alter
ations have been made, will be about 2SOO
yards, or 600 yards longer than at pres
ent.
The Riverside Country Club will hold a
tournament among Its members next
month, and in March will hold an open
tournament. The Catalina Island Golf
Club will hold an open tournament next
month, which will doubtless attract golf
ers from Los Angeles, Pasadena, High
land Park and Riverside, if not from San
Francisco and Oakland.

SCHOOLS THAT
ARE SUITED TO
BE ABOLISHED
One Hundred Classes
Will Go.
DIRECTORS ARI IN EARNEST
EIGHT EVENING SCHOOLS TO EE
CLOSED.
Principals and Vice Principals of
Schools Not Affected Must Take
Charge of Certain
Classes.
SCHOOLS TO BE ABOLISHED. '
Mission Evening, four classes.
Fairmount Evening, tnree classes.
John Swett Evening, five classes.
Hearst Evening, three classes.
Noe Valley Primary, five classes.
Agassiz Primary, twelve classes.
Monroe Primary, five classes.
Cliff House School, one class.
Rincon Evening, five classes.
Richmond Evening, two classes.
Spring Valley Evening, two classes.
Irving Scott Evening, two classes.
From the foregoing It will be seen that
the prunlng-knife of the Board of School
Directors is at work and one by one the
schools are falling before It. Twelve
schools and their staffs of fifty trachers
are known to be marked for the un
assigned list.
It is a matter of wonder that some of
these did not go long ago, especially the
Hearst Evening, which has twenty nupils
distributed among three teachers, and the
Mission Evening has twice as many chil
dren and only four teachers. In the John
Swett and Fairmount a congestion of
educators and a minimum of pupils were
also found.
In every school of the city there will
be a sweeping consolidation of classes,
and even where the school is not on the
abolition list some of their classes are
marked for discontinuance and the revo
lution of economy goes yet further, for
even where neither school nor class has
lost its status teachers will go out, their
work being carried on -by principals and
vice principals.
The John Swett Grammar, the Horace
Mann Grammar, the Lincoln Grammar
and the Adams Cosmopolitan have each
a principal and two vice principals. Deep
cuts will be made into these positions and
in some cases the vice principals will be
dropped. In fact, the reclassiftcation
scheme will level many distinctions
among the city educators.
The Horace Mann Evening School will
escape, but several of its classes will go.
One of these is Miss Gorham's book
keeping class. The closing of the other
two evening schools in that neighborhood,
the Mission and Fairmount, will till the
Horace Mann to a saving capacity. It is
the intention of the Directors to discon
tinue every evening school that can be
spared, and possibly all will be tem
porarily closed.
Director Head has been energetically
"visiting around," and he is determined
that retrenchment shall go down the line
until every school has had a touch of
condensation. Even the high schools
have not escaped notice, anu some ol
their classes are singled out. The Poly
technic School was found to be topheavy
with teachers, and their number will
grow smaller in consequence.
There will be deep cuts among the lit
tle schools in the suburbs. In some cases
one school will be bodily merged into
another, and not only the salaries of
teachers will be saved, but school house
rent.
The Mission High School will lose one
class, the Cliff House School of one class,
taught by Miss A. McLaughlin, will be
transferred to the Barrinffton School at
Point Lobos and Twenty-fifth avenues.
A public meeting will bo held this even-
Ing in Superior Court, Department 6, at
the City Hall, by the citizens who oppose
the closing of the Normal School. Those
who object to the abolition of this insti
tution claim that the pupils are deprived
of the latter half of their year's tuition,
and that by the shutting down of the
school only the janitress' wagesâ s4o per
monthâ is saved. It is not believed, how
ever, that these arguments will have any
effect on the directors, as they appear to
have made up their minds. The two
teachers, Miss Fowler and Miss Fitzger
ald, will in all probability be asigned to
other schools. As for the pupils, they
may all take the teachers' examination,
and so secure certificates just as soon, if
not sooner, than if the school was con
tinued.
Many of the principals have been slow
In the simple work of reporting on the
conditions of their respective schools, and
furnishing the requested data for reclassi
fication. This delay has not had the ef
fect of pleasing the Board of Education,
and the delinquents will be called upon to
hasten in language somewhat severe. Al
ready about seventy-five teachers have
been slated for the unassigned list, and
the positions of fully twenty-five more
are trembling in the balance.
Nor will the reforms strike only the
classes. A number of well-paid employes
of the department are now earning their
last month's wages in that institution.
Said Director Holbrook yesterday:
"When we finish our work, if anybody
can find any idle people drawing fat
money around the San Francisco school
domain they will have to search with a
magnifying glass. I can tell you that
there are some more surprises to fol
low." .
SNATCHED A DIAMOND.
1 Arrest of a Desperate Thief After an
Exciting Chase.
James Merrill, aged 27 years, a cook by
; occupation, yesterday afternoon stole a
diamond stud, valued at $250, from the
shirt front of W. G. Robins of 130 Ellis
j street.
Robins was boarding a car at Haight
and Stany.in streets when Merrill sneaked i
; up behind him and snatched his diamond. !
Robins grabbed the thief, and in the j
struggle that followed he regained posses
sion of the precious stone. The thief at
once took to his heels and disappeared in
Golden Gate Park.
Sergeant Duke was notified of the crime,
and, with only a faint description of Mer
| rill, he started out to find him. Seeing
j a man who answered his description
I sneaking along the brush in the vicinity
] of the affiliated colleges he called upon
; him to halt. Instead of obeying his < um
j mand the thief took to his hecis, but was
I brought to a halt by a shot from Duke"s
I revolver.
Convinced that he was the right man
i the Sergeant took him to the O'Farrell
; street station, where he was confronted
!by Robins and positively identified by
i him. He was then formally booked on a
i charge of grand larceny.
VICE IN SAN FBANCISCO.
: Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson Talks of
the City's Peril.
At the Strangers" Sabbath Home in
the Howard-street M. E. Church last
night the pastor, Rer. Dr. John A. B.
Wilson, prefaced his sermon with a short
statement about the city's peril. He de
clared there are 1000 girls in Chinatown
festering in hopeless slavery that worse
than blood money may go to their
masters and to those In high places who
protect this leprosy for a share in the
swag; that every slave girl could be lib
erated and every gambling den in the oity
closed in six days did those who had the
enforcement of the law determine to do it.
He declared that unblushing vice stalked
through the streets with Impunity and
boys were tempted and going wrong
through the pool rooms. ;fhe speaker
said it was the part and duty of the pulpit
to second the efforts of the press to sup
press the evils referred to, but that it
would not be done until the citizens them
selves joined in the agitation and de
manded the enforcement of the law.
COMPARISON OF TESTAMENTS.
Interesting Lecture by Rabbi Meyers
at the Bush-Street Temple.
"Christians. Moslems and Jewish
Sects" was the subject or an interesting
lecture by Rabbi Myers last evening at
the Bush-street Synagogue. The lecturer
maintained that the New Testament be
longs to the field of Jewish literature.
"It was written," said he, "as Pro
fessor Lightfoot justly observed, 'by
Jews, among Jews and for Jews.' The
Christian terms 'Faith,' 'Grace.' 'Bap
tism.' 'Purification,' 'Redemption,' 'Salva
tion,' etc.. were household words witli the
rabbis. "What is called the 'Lord's Prayer'
consists of phrases from various parts of
the Jewish liturgy."
In concluding the address the rabbi
quoted numerous passages to show the in
timate relationship between the Talmud
and the Nen- Testament.
THE CHOSEN FRIENDS.
The housewarming of Golden Gate
Councilâ that Is, the change of quarters
from the Alcazar to the Foresters' build
ingâwas a pleasant event in the history
of the council. During the evening there
was the installation of officers by Dep
uty Baker, assisted by the past councilor
of Sacramento Council, after which there
was a splendid collation in the banquet
room, where there were, during the dis
cussion of the good things, addresses by
Grand Councilor P.oehm, Grand Recorder
Wallis, Councilor Simons and others, and
several vocal selections. Â»

EXCELS BONANZA
.One of the Klondike's
Richest Fields.
LONGER THAN EL DORADO
DISTRICT EMBRACES A VAST
AREA OF PAY DIRT.
Winter Output of Dawson and Vicin
ity Estimated at $30,000,000,
Double That of Last
Year.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. 22.â P. H. Hebb, who
is part owner of forty Klondike claims,
arrived last night from Dawson. He
brings news that the immense produc
tion of Dominion Creek is proving the
pensation of the winter at Dawson.
Dominion has jumped into prominence
as a gold producer of the first rank,
excelling Bonanza and equaling El Do
rado. Its claims are not as rich as a
limited number on El Dorado, but its
leneth is greater. Do-minion and El
io together will produce from
$10,o00a'vK. to $12,000,000 at the spring
clean-up.
A conservative estimate places the
winter output of the Klondike at $30,
--000,000, doubling the output of last win
ter.
The rich ground along Dominion
comprises thirty-five claims, about
eight and a half miles, extending from
15 ab(,\.- Upper Discovery t>> 20 below
Lower Discovery. The rich dirt is quite
evenly distributed. The pay streak is
from sixty to 200 feet wide and bedrock
is eighteen feet bf.-low the surface.
Gold is found on bedrock and in gravei
from two to tour and a half feet above.
The cre>-k is very easily worked, be
cause the gravel contains less rock
than Bonanza or El Dorado. Bedrock
produces as high as $100 to the pan. It
is believed that the ground will aver
age 15 to 2 r o cents a pan for the entire
eight and a half miles. These rich
claims will produce $25,000 to $50,000
each before they are worked out. The
richest claims are number 1 above Up
per Dtecovery, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13. is,
Â 25, 33, 34, 35 and 36 below Upper
Discovery, 4, 7, 8, VI, 13 above Lower
Discovery and 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 below
Lower Discovery. Number 33 below
Upper Discovery is one of the very
richest.
The prices of Dominion claims have
doubled and trebled since the winter's
development has shown their richness.
Number 4 below Upper Discovery was
s*o!rl by Harry Ash In December for
$100,000. Joseph Beck, formerly a black
smith at Old Tacoma, was negotiating
to sell number 1 above Upper Discov
ery for $75,000.
The estimated output of $30,000,000
â will come from Dominion, El Do
r.i'io. Bonanza, Hunker, Bear, Sul
phur, Quartz, All Gold and Gold Bot

commercial treaty the recent Interpreta
tion of the tariff appraisement of cotton

BALLOTING MAY BE DELAYED
DEATH OF DEPUTY SECRETARY
OF STATE toiONE-
Both Stewart and Newlands Confident
That They Will Eventually Get
a Majority of the
Votes.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CARSON, Jan. 22.â The day has been
quiet in the Senatorial contest, and the
talk of scandal is dying: out. Assembly
man Leidy's friends have denied all
charges placed against him. and say
that he has been pledged to Stewart
from the day of his nomination. The
forces will gather to-morrow and in all
likelihood the struggle will be red-hot
by night.
The State Department has been sadly
dealt with to-day by the death of T.
N. Stone, Deputy Secretary of State.
Mr. Stone has been associated with the
the State University for the last Quar
ter of a century. He was president of
the State University at the time the
institution was at Elko, Xev. ; repre
sented Elko County in the Senate twice
and filled the position of Deputy Secre
tary of State the last four years. His
death may postpone the Senatorial con
test one day, as it is likely that both
Houses will adjourn until after his
funeral.
Newlands returned from Reno this
morning. His friends say he was well
received at Reno and made a very
impressive talk.
Stewart has decided not to make any
open-air canvass, but has confined him
self to strict party work.
Both candidates are confident, and a
rough and tumble right will be culled
off Tuesday at noon.
CUBANS BITTERLY
RESENT NEW ORDERS
Angered by the Instructions Against
the Expenditure of Customs
Receipts.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, Jan. 22.â The or
der from the United States military au
thorities in Havana, directing the au
thorities of the Santiago military depart
ment not to spend a cent of the customs
receipts without the permission of the
Governor General, and the order directing
that hereafter the bulk of sanitary work
shall be done without money pay and for
rations merely, were given to the local
press for publication yesterday, though
received here last Thursday. El Cubano
In commenting upon the instructions of
the Governor General says:
"The feeling is prevalent that the only
course now is to retire to the mountains."
This, of course, is an exaggeration, al
though the fact is that there are people
who make just such threats.
As showing how far the province has
drifted backward since the first an
nouncement that the customs were not to
be freely expended for provisional Im
provements, the Santiago Heraldo re
ports that a band of men is committing
wholesale depredations in the Alayari dis
trict, where several people have been
murdered, and that another in the Guan
tanamo district has burned all the cane
prepared for pressing on the Isabel plant
ation.
"These outbreaks," says the Heraldo,
"are the first fruits of the money central
ization system."
As yet the Mayari report has not been
verified, and Mr. Brooke, owner of the
Isabel plantation, who arrived yesterday,
says that the burning reported on the
plantation must have been done since he
left, as the cane there was intact when he
started for Santiago. He does not ac
cept the report absolutely, but says that
the adjoining plantation, the property of
Senor Busno, was fired -it four different
points, the entire crop being destroyed.
The Independencia concludes an edito
rial with a dÂ»n'ant declaration:
"If necessary the Cubans will know
how to act."
Troops on the Way Westward.
DENVER, Jan. 22.â Fifteen carloads of
the Twentieth United States Infantry
from Fort Leavenworth, Kans., were
transferred from the Burlington road to
the Union Pacific here at 1:15 p. m. to
day and continued their journey west
ward to Ogden, Utah, thence to San
Francisco via the Southern Pacific. At
midnight the Rock Island brought a
second lot of members of the Twentieth,
who leave as soon as possible over the
same route to the West. Two trains of
liftmen cars each are now in readiness to
accommodate this contingent.
; Â« â
Holds to His Prisoners..
ST. JOSEPH, Mo., Jan. 22.â The United
States District Attorney, M. D. Purdy of
St. Paul, has demanded that tne three
men in jail here, known as John Allen,
Harry Howard and James Gilmour,
charged with the Great Northern train
robbery near Fergus Falls, Minn., in No
vember, be turned over to the United
States to be tried lor robbing the mails.
Prosecuting: Atorney Mytton refuses to
deliver the men and it is probable there
will he a clash. The men were identified
a few days ago as the Fergus Falls rob
bers.
THE SAN FEANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1899.
TWO COMPROMISES
ARE SUGGESTED
Propositions to Settle
the Peace Treaty.
MODIFICATIONS ARE URGED
FIGHT AGAINST PERMANENTLY
HOLDING PHILIPPINES.
Army Reorganization Bill Will Come
Up in the House and the Battle
Against Proposed Increase
Renewed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.-The fact
that the anti-ecalping bill was made
the unfinished business of the Senate
by Saturday's vote does not necessarily
insure its immediate consideration. The
general understanding is that this bill
will wait upon the peace treaty and the
appropriation bills and that the Indian
appropriation bill will be the first meas
ure to receive the attention of the Sen
ate during the week. The diplomatic
and pension appropriation bills, also,
may be considered during the week.
Several speeches on the general sub
ject of expansion are exoected to be
made. One of these by Senator White
in opposition to the Government's poli
cy will be made to-morrow, and Sen
ator Lodge will follow Tuesday with
a brief talk In support of the policy and
in advocacy of the early ratification of
the peace treaty. How much time will
be given to the treaty in executive ses
sion will depend upon whether the
Committee on Foreign Relations con
siders it in the interest of the treaty to
press consideration. There js an effort
to arrange a compromise which would
permit speedy action upon the treaty,
but if this is not successful the indi
cations are for considerable delay.
Two compromises are suggested. One
of these is for a } odification of the
treaty or the adoption of a resolution
c laratory against the permanent
holding of the Philippine archipelago,
and the other is for a modification of
the army reorganization bill on lines
desired by the treaty opponents. It is
not yet possible to state whether either
course will be pursued.
On Friday the Senate will listen to
eulogies of the late Reoresentative
Cook of Illinois.
The time of the House this week, ex
cepting to-morrow, which has been set
aside for the consideration of District
of Columbia business, will be devoted
to the army reorganization bill. The
consideration of this bill, which Is re
garded as pre-eminently the most im
portant general measure to come be
fore Congress at this session, has been
delayed by the illness of Chairman
Hull of the Military Affairs Commit
tee. He has recovered sufficiently to
pilot the measure, however, and the
House has formally agreed to take up
its consideration on Tuesday. The cen
eral debate, not including three night
sessions, is to continue fifteen houra
This is as far as the agreement goes.
It includes no provision for final vote.
The debate promises to be both inter
esting and important, as it will raise
all the questions involved in increasing
our standing army to 100.000 men. as
proposed by the bill, together with our
whole future policy relative to the ter
ritory acquired In the recent war with
Spain. Vhere exists a wide variety of
opinions upon the -roposition to in
crease the standing army. It has a
strong majority of Republicans behind
It and it comes into the House with the
indorsement of the President's messajre
practically as an administration meas
ure. The Democrats ana Populists are
intensely hostile to the whole proposi
tion and intend to fight it to the last
ditch. They will have some support
from the Republican side. The odpo
sition, however do not desire to em
barrass the Government and are will
ing to provide for a temporary increase
in the army of 50,000 men In accord
ance with the provisions of the substi
tute bill offered by the minority of the
committee. Or they are willing to au
thorize the continuance, temporarily,
of the present war strength of the reg
ular army (62,000)â anything, in fact,
to prevent the creation of a permanent
increase. In this they have the sym
pathy of many of the Republicans.
The fate of the bill Is in grave doubt.
The statements made on the floor of the
Senate to the effect that It was not the
Intention of the Government to hold
the Philippines permanently, although
their authoritative character was de
nied have placed a weapon in the
hands of the opponents of the measure,
who will use the statement that there
is doubt as to the future of the Philip
pines as a strong argument against a
permanent Increase in the regular
army. The bill may not be completed
this week as the order permits Its con
sideration to be Interrupted by appro
priation bills and conference reports.
One of these, the military acad
emy bill, Is on the calendar. The
river and harbor bill will be re
ported to-morrow and the naval bill
probably before the end < f the week.
OREGON RAILWAY'S
EASTERN OUTLET
Will Build a Line Eastward From
Wallace to Connect With the
Burlington.
DENVER, Jan. 22.â A special to the
News from Wallace, Idaho, says: It is
announced here on what is seemingly
good authority that there will be a line
built from here to connect the Oregon
Railway and Navigation Company with
the Burlington road.
The latter company is to build from Bil
lings west, while the Oregon Railway and
Navigation Company builds eastward
from here. The pass over the Bitter Root
Mountains is directly between here and
Thompson Falls, Mont. A surveying
party has been in the field for several
months running lines that would be of no
value for a local line. The .-surveyors
have, however, been reticent as to their
designs.
ATTEMPT TO DEFRAUD.
Flans in the Contract for a Santa
Cruz Bridge Altered.
SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 22.â Recently the
Supervisors awarded a contract for the
building of a steel and iron bridge near
Aptos to a San Francisco firm of bridge
builders. Work was under way when a
local contractor whose bid was among
those rejected discovered that the plans
on file in the County Clerk's office were
not the same as those he and the other ]
contractors hod figured upon. The plans
are for a bridge that can be built at much ;
less cost.
How the plans were substituted has not
been ascertained. The Supervisors will in
! vestigate. Work on the Aptog bridge has I
! been ordered stopped pendmc the Invest!- I
! gation. The San Francisco firm has done
! work In various counties. Unless it can
i prove that the plans have not been
i changed the certified check given as a
j guarantee that the work will be per
formed according to plans will be forfelt-
I ed and the contract rescinded.
ASSASSIN WIELDS
A BUTCHER KNIFE
RdQch Foreman Near Stockton
Horribly Slashed by a
CooK-
STOCKTON, Jan. 22.â John Tucker, a foreman on the ranch of Cyrus
Moreing & Son, on the Moss Tract, was literally hacked to pieces this
afternoon by Charles Trott. the cook for the outfit. The cause of the
trouble between the men is unknown and it Is not known that they
had any words previous to this altercation.
Trott had been killing hogs and had a large and sharp knife in his
hand, with which he attacked Tucker. The first blow laid his victim's
Bcalp open to the skull. Tucker then threw up his arm in an attitude
of defense, and the second thrust laid the flesh open to the bone from the
shoulder to the elbow. The third murderous slash caught Tucker In the
abdomen and let his entrails down.
The victim will hardly survive the night. He was removed to the
County Hospital. His assailant was arrested shortly afterward by Con
stable Jack. Deputy Sheriffs Wall and Black brought the knife-wielder
to the County Jail. Trott refuses to make any statement.
GOVERNOR STONE
IN QUAY'S BEHALF
Signed Statement From
the Executive.
CHAMPIONS THE SENATOR
SAYS PENNSYLVANIA WANTS
HIS RE-ELECTION.
Predicts That All Will Be Well in
the End if the Supporters of
the Incumbent Stand
Firm.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HARRISBURG, Pa., Jan. 22.âGov
ernor Stone gave the following signed
statement this evening on the Sena
torial situation:
My opinion has not changed since I ex
pressed the belief after the action of the
caucus making Mr. Quay the nominee of
the Republican party for United States
Senator that he would be re-elected. His
supporters have not had a break In their
lines since that time and they nave made
gains. Pennsylvania is a Republican
State, and unless there are some serious
reasons why a regularly nominated candi
date of the Republican â¢â â arty in the State
should not be elected It is usually safe to
predict that he will win. Mure than two
thirds of tne Republican members of the
General Assembly are already publicly
committed to him. No one can honestly
or fairly question the regularity ot trie
nomination of Senator Quay. The caucus
was regularly called and properly con
ducted. Stalwart Republicans generally
throughout the commonwealth have ac
cepted him as the candidate of their party
and want to see him elected.
The conspiracy case brought against
him in the heat of the campaign has been
fully ventilated and the political charac
ter of the proceedings is thoroughly un
derstood by the pe-ople. The argument of
Attorney "Watson before the Supreme
Court clearly demonstrated that there
was nothing in the bills of indictment
against Senator Quay, nor in the testi
mony, showing him to have violated any
law. This has been made plain to all, as
has the fact that this prosecution was in-
Bpired and instituted for the purpose of
influencing votes against Senator Quay in
this Senatorial canvass.
It is not my purpose or intention to
quurrel with any one who is opposed to
Senator Quay. That is his right and priv
ilege. But 1 do say that 1 believe that
way down in the hearts of nearly one-half
of a million Republicans of Pennsylvayia,
who voted for me for Governor at the last
election, there is a feeling of sympathy
for Senator Quay in the present contest.
He has been a brave solo.er in the hour
of his country's trials; he has been a
gallant, able and victorious field marshal
of the Republicans, not only in local and
State campaigns, but In one of the great
est and most bitterly fought national con
tests ever waged in American politics. To
him more than to any one else, as chair
man of the Republican National Commit
tee did we owe the election of General
Benjamin Harrison to the presidency. As
a member of the United States Senate he
has watchfully and zealously guarded the
great industrial, manufacturing and com
mercial interests of our common
wealth. His influence was potential, not
only in materially aiding in the passage
of the McKinley bill, but, with the Demo
crats in control of Congress, through his
close relations with his colleagues on bot
sides of the house, and his statesman-like
course on the floor of the Senate, he saved
Pennsylvania's industries from ruin by
the amendments he had inserted in the
Wilson bill for their especial protection.
There should be no occasion for con
cern among the friends of Senator Quay
on account of the present deadlock on the
Senatorship. Public sentiment in his
favor is making itself Telt among tne
members of the Legislature. If Senator
Quay's supporters stand firm, as lam con
vinced they will, his re-election will cer
tainly follow in du^time^
V. E. Van Valkenburg, who is manag
ing the anti-Quay campaign, issued a
statement to-night in which he says
the Senatorial situation is no longer
complicated nor uncertain. Mr. Van
Valkenburg claims Senator Quay's
strength was at high tide when he re
ceived 113 votes, which is just 14 short
of a majority. Against him are 139
votes; 97 are Democrats and 52 anti-
Quay Republicans.
"The Quay managers have abandoned
all hope of securing a single vote from
the anti-Quay ranks," he adds. "But,
while admitting that no Democrat will
vote directly for Quay at any stage of
the contest, they assert with an air of
mystery rather than of confidence that
at the proper time enough Democrats
will be found to supply the necessary
14 votes that Senator Quay must
have to elect him. The Quay ma
chine is bankrupt in the matter of po
litical patronage. All the attempts of
the Quay people to create friction be
tween the Democrats and anti-Quayites
have signally failed. Senator Quay
amassed all his strength to break the
anti-Quay lines last Wednesday and
failed. He has given orders that an
other effort must be made to break
them next Tuesday, but he will again
fail. Senator Quay may be able to
prolong the deadlock, but re-elect him
self United States Senator from Penn
sylvania, never!"
REPUBLICANS UNSEATED
IN WEST VIRGINIA
CHARLESTON, W. Va., Jan. 22.â As
the West Virginia Legislature has a
majority of only one on joint ballot for
Senator, and that one is In dispute, the
present struggle is called by some a
State edition of the Hayes-Tilden con
test. The factional fighting was ended
when John T. McGraw last Wednes
day night received the Democratic cau
cus nomination and on the following
r.ight N. B. Scott was made the Re
publican nominee. Since then both
parties have been working for parti
san advantages of the settlement of
contested seats. The Republicans are
fighting to hold their own and have a
majority of one, since two of the Re
publicans have been unseated in the
House. As the Democratic majority in
the House threatens to unseat others
the Republican majority in the Senate
has pending three resolutions for con
tests in the upper branch. The bal
loting for Senator begins to-morrow
noon, but before that order is reached
it is expected there will be lively scenes
in both branches of the Legislature in
the cross-firing in the line of retalia
tion. The balloting may be continued
from day to day until both sides get
enough of the retaliation pro-gramme.

DETERMINED TO DIE.
Austrian Cuts His Throat and Jumps
From a Moving Train-
OGDEN, Utah, Jan. 22.â Word was re
ceived from Elko yesterday that Sol
Traohman, a passenger on the eastbound
Southern Pacific passenger train last
night, en route from San Francisco to
Austria, cut his throat and disemboweled
himself and finally jumped from the train
near Palisade, Nov., in an effort to end
his life. At 6 o'clock this evening the man
was still alive, but there were no hopes
for his recovery. His home is in Austria.
It is understood that religious troubles
unsettled his mind.
Boy Accidentally Shot.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 22.â Two schnol
boys._Albert Fats and Willie Smith, went
huntinp this afternoon on Wolfes Hill,
south of town. They had with them a
22-caliber parlor rifle. While engaged in
a friendly scuffle the weapon was dis
charged. The bullet entered young Fais'
right leg midway between the knee and
the groin. Probing failed to locate the
bullet and the boy now lies at the home of
his parents in a critical condition.

The first speaker was James B.

' Mr. Eustia said in part:

persons whose ideas on the question of
:'â â¢'â¢ annexing the Philipines have given me
â¢ â¢ cauee for serious thought. One of them
"thought that by annexation certain Unit
â¢: ed States merchandise could be sold to the ,
â  -Filipinos. The other was a preacher who |
' â  thought by expansion and annexation he
. could sell some Protestant Bibles to the
natives. The President of the United

' EOO.uOO people in these conquered islands.
Yes, our constitutional President is going
to govern them by his personal will, and j
â¢ â¢ wlil you not tell me that the act will not I
-. afford him a swelled head?
Mr. Eustis referred to the late war
with Spain and contended that the
signing of the peace protocol after the
suing for. peace by Spain was in Itself
sufficient to decide the questions in
volved.
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor, was
â  the next speaker. Mr. Gompers Be
."â¢' verely criticized the inconsistency
of the United States Government
'â¢ in going to war to free the Cv- i
bans and of denying the same meas
ure of freedom and liberty to the Fili
pinos. He declared that the flag of the
Nation should never be used to hide
tyranny. He said that it Is not at all
improbable that the Filipinos will yet
become a part of the standing army
â  of the United States and might yet be
called upon to shoot down American
: wage earners. He said it was impos
â¢ Bible to subdue a people by force of
arms and at the same time maintain
our free institutions.
W. Bourke Cochran, the next speaker,
said:
. . This heresy of imperialism sweeping
over the country Is threatening the sta
bility of our institutions and our measure
. of free government. It Is a policy of In
famy. In this country of ours, the home
. of a"lien races, we are now raising aloft
their hands In protest against a policy

Special Dispatch to The Call.
horizon of the whole human race. Shall
this country step down from the high
eminence which she has attained in the
family <Â»f nations in the matter of im
perialism? When we are asked to take
this step it is but natural that we ask Its
promulgators to unravel their pretenses,
and when we do bo we find them advocat
ing contradictory arguments. The ques
tion of Imperialism and expansion, boiled
down to Its true import, is a dangerous
policy to oith-r adopt or pursue. The
imperialists tell you that trade follows
the nag, when, in fact, every American
knows that the opposite is the case It
is the Hag that follows trade. Is it part
of the principles of our free and inde
pendent Government to proceed to civ
ilize a weaker people by first shooting and
then robbing them? We shrink from the
responsibility imposed upon us by destiny,
and when we fail to be convinced of this
.. to destiny we are charged with be
ing un-American. This child of destiny
.1 a^ n 5 w U. growth ln this country, but in
the Old W orld he is as old as human de
pravity.
No nation, particularly the American
nation, can have a citizen soldiery and a
mercenary army. It IS against the faith
ol Washington and the signers of the Dec
laration of Independence. The imperial
ists of to-day would have you believe that
W ashington and the framers of the con
stitution descended on the Capitol at
Washington and played havoc with the
nation and were, of course, decidedly un-
American.
With regard to the Philippines, if we
are to become barbarous, let us excell in
our barbarity, as we have excelled in our
civilization, all the other nations of the
world. Let us not substitute the weight
of cannon balls for moral Integrity and
support. I confess I am in favor of ex
pansion if it is meant in the right direc
tion. In this case everything depends Â«on
what is meant by the right direction. If
we want expansion, why, here to the
north ot us lies a country which Is a
natural part of us. Why not annex
Canada? I'd be delighted to see that line
of custom houses beyond our border
blown into the Great Lakes and our line
of territory to the north of us extended
to Baffin Bay. Deeply as I desire annexa
tion with Canada, I would not have it by
force of arms. The histories of Alsace
and Lorraine and England's treatment of
Ireland but too well illustrate tho foolish
ness of annexation by force and coercion.
Now. if England likes us as she claims
she does, let her convince Canadians that
their true destiny is with us.
AGUINALDO'S ENVOYS
REACH WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22.â Dr. Jose
Lozada, Senor Juan Luna and Captain
Marti Burgos, representatives of Agui
naldo, commissioned by him to come to
the United States and aid in the es
tablishment of a Filipino Junta, of
which Agoncillo is to be the head, ar
rived in Washington yesterday. All
three are natives of Manilla, educated in
Europe, and represent the best element
of Filipinos. Concerning their mission
to Washington, Dr. Lozada says:
"We have come here as representa
tives of the Philippine government, of
which General Emilo Aguinaldo, the
great patriot and statesman, is presi
dent. We are here under sealed orders
to Senor Agoncillo, who Is Einbassador
and Plenipotentiary to the United
States. We will place ourselves under
his direction, for the single purpose of
securing the recognition of the Philip
pine government by the United States.
How such recognition will be brought
about of course I am not at present
able to state, although we have out
lined a plan of action and will begin
work at once; always, of course, in a
diplomatic manner. Much will depend,
of course, upon the ratification or re
jection of the peace treaty now before
your Senate, or its possible amendment.
Afl yet the American Government has
not "defined its policy toward the Phil
ippine Islands, but it is our aim to se
cure absolute independence."

PROTEST AGAINST THE
ANTI-GERMAN EXPRESSIONS
MUNICH, Jan. 22.â The Nueste Nach
richten, which raised a storm of in
dignation among the ultra-patriotic
papers by hinting that German dointrs
in the Philippines were largely respon
sible for the delicate relations between
the United States and Germany and
that as the German Foreign Office
knew nothing of them it would be ad
visable to institute an investigation
with a view of avoiding the recurrence
of such mistakes, makes the following
announcement to-day:
"The Americans here have decided to
=end to the Washington Government a
protest against the anti-German ex
pressions used in the House of Repre
sentatives, and a declaration that no
animosity against America exists in
Germany, where Americans always
meet with the most friendly reception."

SEATTLE TAKES
ANOTHER GAME
FROM ATHLETICS
Old - Time Nerve-
Racking Baseball.
NUMEROUS HITS AND ERRORS
VISITORS WIN OUT IN THE LAST
HALF OF TB.iL NINTH.
They Will Make a Tour of the State,
After Which They Will Return
to This City and Disband.
The Amateur League.
Out at Recreation Park yesterday the
Seattles and Athletics served up to 2500
people one of the good old regulation
Haight-street ball games; one of those
contests replete with vaudeville turns,
both good and bad, when the men who
did the most brilliant work also contrib
uted the rawest bungles, where the error
column ran Into two figures, base hits
were ruthlessly slaughtered, the score for
some Inexplicable reason kept down to ex
asperatingly low totals ana the outcome
only decided in the last half of the ninth
inning. In fact it was Just such a game
as keeps the spectators on the verge of
heart failure and terminates in a blaze
of fireworks.
Those new meal tickets had evidently
been used to good advantage by the wan
derers from the north, for they played
as they have not done since they
struck town. But although they lammed
the ball hard they could not place it safe
until the latter part of the game, nor
were they able to profit materially by the
frequent errors of the locals untily about
the same time.
Lohtnan's wing was out of plumb and
whenever he attempted to throw the ball
everybody ducked their heads, for there
was no telling in what part of the lot it
would land, totultz and McLaughlin also
showed themselves to be somewhat out of
repair, but withal the Athletics kept
everybody guessing and when they tied
the score in the first half of the ninth
inning all their previous sins were for
given.
There were four double plays, one
of which would have been a triple
had not Haniey spoiled It by drop
pins' the ball. It happened In the
seventh inning. ODea was safe on
McLaughlin's error of his hit. Rand
bunted and Lohman, who got the ball,
threw wide to second to head off ODea,
and both were safe. Babbitt popped up a
fly over first, which looked as though It
would land safely, and both runners led
away off. Johnson, however, got hold of
the ball and laced It down to McLaugh
lin at second, nailing O'Dea. Mac re
turned it to Haniey, who was covering
first and had Rand caught by a block,
but Haniey dropped the ball and the run
ner got back to the bag. He slid over,
however, and Haniey, who made a light
ning recovery, tagged him nut. It looked
like a triple play to the spectators, but
it was really only a double.
In the second Clark completed a double
play unassisted. Iberg was on first and
Btarted for second Just as McCarthy sent
up a foul fly. < lark gathered it in and
mannsod to beat Iberg back to the bag by
a nose.
Nither Bide did any run-getting until tho
sixth, when Rellly drove one at Mc
hlln nnrl went to second on the lat
tnrow to first. Parrott sacri
ficed him to third and Clark drove him
home witli a single.
The Athletics got two In the eighth,
THE TALL MANS TEETH,
THE SHORT MAN'S TOE
These Two Factors Spoiled a Promising Amateur
Footrace Between Government
Inspectors.
THIS is a story of tho long man
and the fhort man, a sort of a
robbing story, too, In which the
short man said to the tall man,
"Get out of the way; you are
Blower than the second com
ing:." And the tall man said to the
short man, "Doggone you, you,
wouldn't know you were alive If you
didn't breathe. I can outspeed you
at anything."
The foregoing pleasantries were
passed between "Mother" J. J. Mc-
Govern, the tall man, and William
J. Henrichs, the short man, both
customs inspectors of this city. The
result was a challenge to a foot race
of 100 yards, with a wager of $100
attached. The trouble developed two
weeks ago, and since that time the
two men have been industriously
training at the Olympic indoor
track, with special trainers to look
aftÂ« r their welfare. The long man
conditioned himself on the very best
"tenderloin" food, and the stout
man on toast and tea. Much to the
surprise and chagrin of both they
put on increased weight. This add
ed to the catastrophe.
The Custom-house employes and
the "real people" of the waterfront
took a great Interest in the contest
and many substantial wagers fol
lowed, with MeGovern the hot fa
vorite. In arranging the affair it
was stipulated that the winner was
to pay for a French dinner for the
crowd, and in the case of a fluke
the stakes were to go for the same
purpose.
A decidedly representative crowd
from the Custom-house visited the
Olympic Club grounds yesterday
afternoon, armed with cameras and
anxiety to witness the important
event. The principals arrived late
and were noticeably nervous. Later
they emerged from the dressing
rooms, only to be greeted with a
howl that was heard at the Cliff
House. The howl was certainly
coming to the crowd. "Mother" Mc-
Govern was garbed in the colors of
<j> the rainbow. His racing costume
O consisted of the tights, trunk and
â ^ jacket in which he once appeared as
9 the amateur tenor in "Rigoletto."
q Henrichs' stout fi&ure was Incased
nice clean ones unmarred by a false play.
McCarthy nipped off a single and stole
second. Meaney followed with another
single and both tallied when McLaughlin
touched off another. Nice batting that.
The locals could not hold their lead,
though, for Seattle made a brace in its
half of that inning. Anderson was safe
on McLaughlin's fumble and went to
third on Reilly's single. Lohman threw
wide to second to catch Reilly, letting
Anderson in ahead of the ball. Reilly
kept on to third and again Lohman shot
wide and Josh completed the circuit.
After that Kleiber and Hartman singled,
but neither scored.
Athletics tied the score in the ninth,
when Stultz and Johnson led off with sin
gles. Hanley bunted and all were safe,
ohman sent a long fly to Parrott, Stultz
beating the ball home.
With one man out Babbitt scored the
winning run with a triple to left and Loh
man's error of the throw to the plate.
The Seattles will .start on a tour oi the
State this week, playing games at Sacra
mento, Stockton, Santa Cruz, San Jose,
Watsonvllle and Vallejo. Upon their re
turn the team will disband. Several of
the members have signed with the Cali
fornia League for the coming season,
while the others will go East. The score:

in pajamas, the lower portion of
which had been sawed off above the
knees. Though beautiful, he was not
so light and airy as ho looked.
Henrichs Indulged for some time
in the professional kicking act, In
sisting that McGovern should be
handicapped by carrying a couple of
bricks, but the stakeholder held him
to the primitive conditions, not
withstanding he declared it was
tempting death to start with his
knuckles to the ground. They got
away at the snap of the camera
amid great excitement. "Mother"
had not forgotten his earlier train
ing at Halfmoon Bay, when it was
once necessary for him to get out of
the way of an enraged Indian, and
h<Â» took the lead. Henrichs floun
dered close behind, and things went
speedily for ' about thirty yards,
when suddenly McGovern was seen
to stagger and the next instant
Henrichs slipped, turned a painful
somersault and was out. So was
"Mother."
The stakeholder invostijrnted and
reported that the accident was duo
to the fact that McGovern had care
lessly dropped his false tooth,
grabbed for them and fallen. Poor
Henrichs was unfortunate enough
to step on the piece of dental art
work and nearly broke his neck.
Wi.on told that the "race was off
and the dinner on" and that "Moth
er" McGovern was ruled off the
track for life for using foul and un
seemly tactics, the stout man said
"What?" five times rapidly, but was
not satisfied. He declared that if he
had not "strained himself in un
winding the silk from the body of
that smuggling army surgeon the
other day" ho would have "won the
race." McGovorn's tights and tem
per were equally ruined. As all beta
were drawn, it is understood that
these two hot rivals for pre-emi
nence in athletics will settle the
question of speed in a friendly four
round bout with the gloves. They
are both in condition, and are tired
of talking, so the event should be
near at hand.
The foregoing is the account of the
event as related by a delegation of
Custom House inspectors, headed by
Inspector Durkln.

Plans of the Various Amphibious
Organizations.
At the last meeting of the Alameda
Boat Club the following officers were
elected for the coming year: C. H. Smith,
president; C. Pesoli, vice president; W. 15.
Hinchman, secretary; George H. Miller,
treasurer; Dr. C. W. Knowles, F. A.
Hammersmith and Theodore Elsfeldt,
members of the executive board; W. G.
Hansen, captain; H. W. Lubbock, lieu
tenant captain. W. Q. Hansen. who rowed
at No. 2 in the senior barge crew, was a
candidate for the vice presidency, but
withdrew. E. Hunter, last season's cap
tain, has gone to New York for two years,
and expects to be In Paris during the ex
position. Atwell Webb, who rowed No. 3
in the senior bargo crew, and was a candi
date for the office of captain, goes to
Stockton on business, and will stay there
for several months. At the last meeting
H. W. Maas, on behalf of the members,
presented a handsome silver berry bowl
and spoon to President C. H. Smith, in.
recognition of his services to the club.
The president was taken by surprise, but
was much gratified at the mark of ap
preciation.
On the evening of February 10 the club
â¢will give a vaudeville entertainment in
Armory Hall, Alameda. Some very good
talent has been engaged, and an excellent
performance is assured. The object is to
raise tunds for the enlargement of the
boat house, which is inadequate to the
present requirements. It is proposed to
get a piano and in other ways to render
the club quarters attractive to the mem
bers. The following committee of arrange
ments is in charge of the entertainment:
F. S. Cone. David Greenleaf, W. G. Han
sen. Theodore Eisfeldt and Herbert Wll
helmi.
The Alameda club has acquired for the
use of its members a new pleasure boat
built by Hartman. As A. C. Webb, No. 3
of the senior barge crew, has left Ala
meda and Eugene B. Hadcock, bow, in
tends to take up single sculling, the senior
crew will be broken up and some new
oarsmen will have a chance of represent
ing the club and distinguishing them
selves.
The new officers of the South End Row-
Ing Club will be Installed at the next
meeting. Dr. C. C. Dennis Is practicing
in a shell, and J. Lyons in an outrigKcd
skiff. The repairs to the barge Felton
have been completed by Rogers, the Ala
meda boatbuilder. The southeasterly grÂ»!,
of last week, combined with the high
tides, battered the floats in front of the
boat house so that considerable repairs
will be necessary. Last Sunday some of
the members, under the supervision of E.
Scully, did several hours' good work on
the handball court; among them Al J.
Fritz was conspicuous.
A. W. Pape, captain of the Dolphin Boat
Club, is getting together the crews and
water polo teams for the coming season.
the following members having been noti
fied to come down to the boat house for
practice: A. Brannan, Lester Hammer
smith, C. T. Roach, George Baker and F.
W. Woernner. George Baker was for
merly the cannonball expert at the Young
Men s Christian Association and has
been going out frequently in a skiff; he
will probably fill Victor Caglleri's place
In the Intermediate barge crew, while the
other four will form a Junior barge crew.
Last Sunday several members were down
at the boat house swimming and talking
over the prospects for the coming season.
A. Schuppert, who owns a four-oared
shell, has promised to lend It to the club
if a crew will enter the shell races at the
Astoria regatta this year.
Last week's storm damaged the Ariel
Club's float and wrecked that of the Pio
neers. Both these clubs expect to remain
undisturbed in the possession of their
i>".'ir booses on Long Bridge for at any
rate a year, but the Pioneer quarters
underpinning to render them secure even
for that time.

i San Francisco Call,
Broadway, Jan. 22.
Hless many would-be
. Oakland who would
opening of the mu
tt to meet tho latest
be brought forward
the public eye. He
â¢il at this time, ar.d
need not be in doubt
tk*i of the welcome he
n this city of practical pol
ans. Tnisi refers to that class of angel
.. -ich hovers around and without solici
tation, without guarantee, without consid
eration and without any hope <>t reward
on this eldo of the crave, drops HltLe
sacks containing nine hundred dollar
"wads" into the laps of those who are
fortunate enough to be thus visited. Oak
land has produced some "good things"
politically, but there is no record of any
thing quite so good as this.
Dr. Pardee and his friends are showing
a great deal of philosophical common
sense in not permitting the doctor's name
to be hawked about for any nomination
that is in the gift of the Republican
party. Alameda County morally took an
oath last fall that she would have the
Governorship of the State for her favor
ite candidate or she would have nothing.
A gallant start was made, and as things
are understood to be at present. Dr. IJar
dee is in line for the nomination for Gov
ernor when Mr. Gage shall be Hearing his
retirement. However, this dues not ap
parently prevent the Democrats from try
ing to !".dKt an Estee of Dr. Pardei'. They
are evidently anxious to have the doctor
placed in a position in which it would
appear that he is a standing candidate for
anything mat pomes along.
At present Dr. Purdue is the gratuitous
choice of the Democrats for a Republican
Senator, but the doctor himself has posi
tive];. Baid he is not a candidate and he
is paying tin more attention tv the mat
ter ~: >thing would delight the Demo
crats more than to have Pardee taken up
for Senator and turned down, so that
four years hence his name would have
become stale politically and he could with
some degree of truth be classed with the
chronic office-seek' rs.
However, even the Democrats in their
enthusiasm over the question seem to
have fallen short of their usual exercise
of sagacity. Already they have supplied
enough material to last the doctor
through one-half of his campaign when
he again comes before the State. Over
a solid pap.- of the most laudatory and
pleasant criticisms of the doctor's life
and doings, privately and politically, has
been spread broadcast by the Democratic
press, all of which is being carefully filed
away by the doctor's friends for repro
duction in the future.
If I might venture a guess I should say '
that the burning Issue in local politics j
during the next two years will be gas,
and not water, as In the past few years.
A very interesting situation now exists,
which is entirely new to this community,
.and yet it can be said truthfully that
there is a precedent in degree, if not in
kind, with which to compare it. Since
this city needed any other illumination j
than candles and coal oil lamps, there has
been but one gas company. At times com
petition has been breathed, but tnai .
The existing company has always sought '
to secure and retain the friendship of the
municipal government and the citizens.
This has been done by a plan that might
almost be called co-operative, inasmuch
as no demand has ever been made- on the
corporation to reduce the price of its gas
yet it has always been reduced in the j
ratio of the number of consumers.
A few days ago much surprise was cre
ated by the Incorporation of a new gas
company. This company has agreed |
.isnong its directors that for three years i
prices about 30 per cent Jess than those j
now charged shall prevail. This is, of i
course, a question of maraked importance I
ALAMEDA CAMPAIGN
WILL BE CLEAN CUT
HARMONIE HALL PARTY WOR
RIES THE CANDIDATES.
Declares There Must Be Two Distinct
TicKets in the Field and That
They Are Out for
Patronage.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 22.â The Harmonic
Hall party declared Itself this afternoon
at a meeting of the general committee,
and to-night all the politicians in town are
discussing the actions of the leaders and
some of the admisions made at the meet-
A few evenings ago the Harmonle Hall
executive committee adopted the follow
ing resolution:
"It is the sense of this committee that
any candidate who signs the platform of
the Municipal League convention be not
supported by this committee."
As most of the local candidates had
been striving to shut off .opposition by se
curing the indorsement of both the
League and the Harmonic Hall people,
the resolution sent them scurrying around
to ascertain where they stood. Then a
Blighty howl went up against the resolu
tion. "It was characterized as a high
handed piece of business and an effort
on the part of one or two men to run
the Harmonic Hall machine.
The meeting this afternoon was called
for the purpose of discussing the actions
of the executive committee. The outcome
was tlutt the resolution was Indorsed and
the action of the committee ratified.
As a result, two complete tickets will
be in the tield at the spring election, a
condition never heard of before in Ala
meda politics.
Henry Mailer, secretary of the execu
Â»'v "- -.oinmlttee, said the purpose of the
utlnn was to compel every candidate
he ticket to get in and work for the
it has been the practice," he said, "for
,-ne of the candidates to get on all the
â¢kets. and then when election day came
nd they had a cinch on their jobs they
vould take things easy and smile while
J>e rest of ua worked."
He also dwelt on the assertion that Har
nionie Hall was out for the public patron
age, and if the party was successful in
the spring every appointive oftice to be
filled must come from the ranks of the
Harmonle Hall organization. This is
another thing never dreamed of before in
the municipal affairs of Alameda.
Alexander Mackie, who is a candidate
City Trustee, addressed the meeting
and charged that the city electric light
vlant was conducted in an extravagant
lanner and that the city's acounts vs. re
s<M>t very loosely. He asserted that the
Uv government could be run on a tax
of 7.", cents instead of $1 22 as at pres-
B. J. Smith retorted by~ stating that
Mackie did not know axle grease from
lubricating oil. The chairman shut off
the acrimonious debate before any blood
was spilled.
it was proposed to suggest names to go
the party's ticket, but such action was
nit off by the unique statement from
Muller that there would be a
rrneral understanding that the executive
Jbmrnittee would-take the matter in hand
Â»nd determine who the candidates should
to the household consumer, especially as
the use of gas for domestic purposes is
rapidly Increasing in this city.
There is, however, a more important as
pect of this question. The City of Oak
land now pays for its street lighting and
, for the illumination supplied its municipal
buildings a sum approximating $S0,(X)0 a
year. This of itself is a tolerably com
fortable income for a corporation. Tiiis
means, of course, that the head and body
of any competition will center itself about
the municipal contract. Experience lias
taught that under such circumstances
either corporation would naturally be
I forced for its own protection to do every
| thing possible to secure the necessary six
! votes in the City Council and two in the
Hoard of Public Works to obtain the con-
I tract. No other possibility can exist.
Oakland has, therefore, if the exploited I
plans of the new company be carried out,
the prospect of a rate cutting war in gas
before her. Whether this will prove bene
ficial or not ultimately is the point to be
determined. Four years ago Oakland had
but one water company. The rates it I
charged were considered to be abnormally I
high, and the public voice was always
heard demanding that the schedule be
lowered. Somehow or other the corpora
tion always was able to secure the p&s-
Bage of its high rates by the City Council.
Periodically Indignation would assert it
self, mobs would denounce the water com
pany and besiege the council chamber at
the time of tixing rates, but after the an- ,
nual excitement died away the people ;
were compelled for another twelve
months to pay their tax into the coffers of
the corporation, there being no alterna
tive. Competition fame along and for
about two years Oaklanders enjoyed pay
ing an absurdly low rigure for water.
Houses which would reasonably pay a
dollar and a half a month were accommo
dated for i! 0 cents. Everybody was de
lighted and the city congratulated itself
upon the advantages of competition.
The situation is now different. There ]
are still two water companies, but no
competition. Since the beginning of this
year they should be getting rich, but it
is at the expense of the people, who two |
years ago were so jubilant over getting !
water at a ridiculously low li^ure. The I
man who would be willing to pay a dollar
and a half and got his water for a quar
ter now finds his bill over three dollars. '
and the presidents of both water compa
nies blandly tell the objector that he is ,
being greatly favored, as the rates now
charged are nothing m?ar those in the ;
schedule which the water companies in- J
duced the Council to pass last spring. It j
is expected that very shortly there will ;
again be but one water company and that j
the city will be called upon to pay the |
legal 6 per cent upon their united capi
talization of $9,000,000.
In other words property-owners have
suffered greatly from competition in
water.
Now the question has forced itself be
fore the public as to whether competition
in gas is going to be a benefit or a detri
ment. At present Oakland pays $1 50 and
51 25 for illuminating and cooking gas re
spectively. The new company proposes
to place its stock in escrow, so that for a j
period of three years gas ehall be sold at
$1 and 75 cents respectively, and so that
no rival corporation shall buy it out dur
ing that period.
But after three years? This is a ques
tion for the social and political economists
to conjure with.
Residents of Temescal have caused a
small wave of disappointment to spread
over Oakland. For many years the pic
turesque little suburb of Temescal has
rejoiced in its pretty, euphonious name.
"Temescal" is rather poetic. Now come
the residents and demand a change. They
declare that the name of their suburb
means "a sweathouse." and this they
consider an insult. No doubt they are
right, they ought to know, but no or.c
will willingly strike the pretty word from
the nomenclature of this county. And,
after all, it isn't so bad as Hargtown or
Los Gatos (the cats), though it may not
compare favorably with Los Ang> l< b.

be. In that event : ' does not appear what
the nominating convention, to be called
hereafter, will have to do.
The Aiunlcipal League will meet to-mor
row night to continue the work of naming
Its ticket.

A LINEMAN'S PERIL.
Gus Erickson Almont Killed by a Live
Light Wire.
ALAMEDA. Jan. 22.â Gus Erickson, a
lineman in the employ of the Sunset Tele
phono Company, while at work at the top
of a forty-foot pole this morning received
the force of the current used in operating
the Alameda and Oakland electric line,
and was nearly killed.
Erickson was engaged with other work
men stringing new telephone wires along
Park street, near the tidal canal bridge.
The telephone wire crossed the feeders
of the electric line, and when Erickson
took hold of it to make it fast to an in
sulator 1000 volts of electricity went
through his system. The palms of the
man's hands were burned to the bones,
the flesh peeling off in strips.
Whrn he received the shock he dropped
limp upon the crossbeams, where he
dangled for a few moments in midair, the
crowd below expecting that if ho was not
already dead from the shod: he would be
killed by the fall to the ground, which
seemed inevitable.
Erickson was in a semi-conscious con
dition, but he still retained sufficient of
his senses to clutch the pole with his
arms. He swung his body from the cross
beams and darted feet first to the ground.
He broke the force of the fall by cling- j
ing to the pole until he was within ten
leet of the bottom, when his strength
gave way and he dropped to the pave
ment limp and apparently lifeless.
He was aimed into a house near by,
where he was attended by Dr. E. M.
Keys. The man was in convulsions for
over three hours, when he .rallied some
what and was removed to the Receiving
Hospital in Oakland.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1899.
INTERPRETER
FOR ONG FOON
IS ASSAULTED
He Was Attacked by
Highbinders.
ONE OF THEM ARRESTED
HONG SING SAYS THE SLAVE
DEALERS WANT HIM.
Louie Lee, the Man Under Arrest,
Protests His Innocence and De
nies He Is a Hatchet
maiL.
Hong Sing, a member of the Chinese !
Society for English Education, who S
went to Santa Rosa last week to act as ;
I interpreter In the case of Ong Foon, j
| charged with murder, claims he was J
i assaulted last night by three members - t
iof the Bing Kong Tong. One of his j
i supposed assailants, Louie Lee, he |
pointed out to Officer Slattery of Lieu- i
tenant Eso-la's squad, and Lee was j
charged at the California-street sta
tion with battery.
According to Sing's story he was !
sent to Santa Rosa to act as interpreter j
and assist in the defense of Ong Foon. i
! He returned to this city Saturday and
! learned on his arrival here that a price
j of $500 had been placed on his head by
the slave owners, whom he claims are
interested in the conviction of Ong
Foon on account of the harm the latter
has done the slave dealers by giving
information to the authorities. Sing
says that the Bing Kong Tong is an
organization composed of those en
| gage d in keeping houses of ill fame.
Sing states that as he was walking
along Washington street, near the cor
ner of Fish alley, last night, he was
assaulted by three men. He called for
the police and his assailants ran. Offi
cer Slattery heard the commotion, and
seeing seme half-dozen Chinamen run
ning started for the nearest one, when ;
Sing pointed out Louie Lee as the man ,
Ihe wanted arrested. Slattery captured
Lee, but the others escaped.
At the station Louie Lee protested
his innocence. He declared that he was
standing at the corner of Fish alley and
j Washington street when several men
ran past him. He turned to see what
the trouble was and was grabbed by :
Sing, who cursed him and accused him
;of having hit him over the head. Lee
denies that he belongs to the Bing ;
: Kong Tong, but admits that he is a
i member of the Chinese Society of Free
; .Masons and wears a badge of that or- j
! der. Those familiar with the societies |
| in Chinatown say that the Free Masons '
I are a highbinder organization. One of \
their clubs was raided by Lieutenant
Price recently and the members or
dered to leave town.
Sing, as soon as he was assaulted,
made the statement that the attack <
was due to the part he took in the Ong
Boon case. His charge that the assault
was made at the instigation of the
slave dealers is doubted by some of the
j officers, as the Educational Society is
at war with the slave men and wish to
bring to their doors anything that goes
wrong in Chinatown. As a matter of
fact it is not the slave owners of San
Francisco who are directly responsible
for the prosecution of Ong Foon on
the charge of murder. The complaint
was sworn to by Wong Tan, a resident
j of Santa Rosa.
The murder was committed six years
ago and Tan claims that the first he j
knew of the whereabouts of Ong Foon I
! was by reading an account of his ar-
I rest on the charge of attempted extor
tion. Officers from Santa Rosa were
in the city severatdays before the trial '
on that charge took place and it was
through the efforts of the parties in
terested in that prosecution that Foon
j was not arrested for murder before the
trial. The prosecutors of Foon claim
that he he is also wanted for a mur
der committed in Sacramento the same
I year as that at Santa Rosa. They say
' that the case was hushed up on the
1 condition that Foon would leave Sacra-
I mento and not return. He went back
some time ago. It is claimed, but was
obliged to leave to save his life.
DR. STEBBINS SENDS
IN HIS RESIGNATION
HE WAS THE SUCCESSOR OF
THOMAS STARR KING.
An Affectionate Farewell to the Con
gregation of the First Unita
rian Church.
Dr. Stebbine yesterday bade farewell to
the congregation and the church in which
he has labored faithfully for so many
years, in the following tender words:
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 22, 1599.
To Mr. Frank J. Symracs, Moderator of the
B. ard of Trustees of the First Unitarian
Churrh of San Francisco, and to the Trustees
and people of Die churchâ Pearly Beloved: I
am admonished by time and events that the
hcur is come lor me to resign the trUÃt which
I have held as your minister into your hands;
:>!:1 I do hereby resign it, that you may be
lre>? to act according: to the dictates of your
discretion ami as the welfare of the church
demands. And I come to this decision by
methods dictated alike by nature and heaven.
God liath so ordered the generations of man
kind that one generation goeth and another
generation cometh, and thus 1b kept the bond
that binds mankind to the throne of God.
Originally unknown to you. I was chosen
through your confidence to be the successor of
thÂ» beloved Thomas Starr King. With what
ever faithfulness or defect that trust has been
discharged you are the most fit judges, and I
Funmlt it all to your candid and true feeling.
1 will not dwell upon Its Imperfections, nor in
dulge in any enthusiasms of self-depreciation
or honorable, pride of self-respect. These all
ar<Â» With vim and are sate.
I may say, perhaps, with grateful satisfac
tion as under the guidance of a Divine Provi
dence, that this ministry has been devoted to
those great human interests that belong 1 to
man as man, and to human nature In its great
common experiences and i vents rather than
to a provincial ecclesiaFtlcism or parochial
policy. The church of God is co-ordinate with
universal man. and human progress is but an
other name for the increasing splendor of that
light that llghteth every man that cometh Into
the world. For this every human interest is
dear and rellcion consecrates, confirms and
establishes all forever and ever.
I thank God through .TesUF Christ and the
common dally life of men that this ministry*
has reckoned human nature and the divine na-i
ture of kindred blood and has never despised
any man because he was rich or poor or igno
rant or black, but has esteemed Jiim as hold-
Ing some mysterious ajid eternal relation to
the father of all, and In my heart of hearts I
can ask no greater blessing on you all than
that the ministry that shall succeed me may
have ns wide a grace and as free a love as the
best that is In us can suggest of God or man.
And now may love and blessing and honor
and power be upon you from on high evermore.
Amen.
(Signed) HORATIO STEBBINS.
By Roderick Stebbins.
As this resignation was given at the
morning service, the trustees as yet have
had no time to consider it in its business
relations to the church, 'mere is little
doubt, however, that they will be un
willing to accept his resignation so long
as Dr. Stebbins is alive and improving in
health, but they feel that he desires rest.

FIFTEEN MILLIONS
IN A LUMP SUM
Big Deal Just Concluded
in Tennessee.
INVESTMENT OF A SYNDICATE
BUYS FURNACES, RAILWAYS
AND COAL LANDS.
Strongest Company Ever Organized
in the South Will Develop
Hitherto Untouched
"Resources.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
KNOXVILLE, Term.. Jan. 22.â The
largest business transaction made in
the South in ten years has just been
made here. It involves an investment
of $15,000,000. The Virginia Coal. Iron
and Railway Company has bought the
immense blast furnaces at Ma^
Meadows, Pulaskl, Roanoke, Va., and
Bristol, Term.; also the Bristol and
Elizabethton and the South Atlantic
and Ohio Railroad. Cash is paid for
all the properties. The company be
comes owner of 125,000 acres of coking
coal lands, 60)000 acres of ore lands,
two railroads and nine furnaces. The
railroads extend from Big Stone Gap,
Va., to Elizabethtown, Term., passing
through Bristol, Term., and the rich
coal, mineral and timber lands of the
1 new company.
The result of this transaction is due
to the efforts of Colonel E. J. Sanford
i of this city, president of the Knoxville
| and Ohio Railroad; Colonel E. M. Me-
I Ghee of this city, who is known among
! the railroad magnates, and Mr. Ben
, Dulaney of Bristol, Term. Colonel San
i ford and Mr. Dulaney interested New
Yurk people in the enterprise and or
ganized the company v.ith $7,500,000
stock subscribed and the same amount
of bonds were issued and sold for soot
cash. E. B. Chapman of Moore &
Sohley, the i*ew York bankers, car
ried the deal through and that firm un
derwrote tho bonds.
The Bristol Furnace was purchased
j over a year ago by Colonel Sanford and
; Colonel McGhee, thereby forming the
< nucleus of what has developed into
such a strong concern. This furnace
will be put into active operation lrame
! diately, under the management of
' George T. Carter, president of the new
company, who has for ten years been
> president of the Carter Coal and Iron
Company. .
The gentlemen composing the com
pany have made propositions seeking
the purchase of the furnaces at John
-1 son City and Embreeville, Term. The
company is the strongest ever organ
i lzed in the south for a similar purpose.
! It will develop untold resources hereto
, fore untouched. East Upper Tennes
, see and Southwest Virginia are rich in
! coal, iron, zinc and other minerals, to
! gether with valuable forests of timber
of every description. The develop
ments of these properties will begin at
once. _

HER DINNER DRESS

Awful Death of Miss
Jeannie Moore, a
Victim of
Fire.
Her Garments Ignited
From a Blazing Cur
tain â Mrs. Gray
Killed by an
Explosion.
MISS JEANNTB A. MOORE, daughter
of the late I. C. Moore, formerly a
â wealthy merchant of this city, was
ao terribly burned about the lower
rart of the body last Saturday even
ing that phe died In great agony at
7 o'clock yesterday morning.
Miss Moore was in her room at the fam
ily residence, 2323 Gough street, dressing
for a dinner party she had been Invited
to attend at the home of I. Strassburger.
The other members of the Moore family
were downstairs in the dining room, when
they heard piercing shrieks emanate from
Miss Jeannle's room. Rushing upstairs
they found the unfortunate girl lying on.
the floor wrapped in a blanket she had
torn, from the bed. The light dress she
wore and her underclothing were burned
away, and her flesh was frightfully
scorched.
Dr. Jellinek, the family physician,
quickly responded to a summons and
found the young lady in a semi-con
scious condition. While the trunk and
lower limbs were horribly burned, the
flames had mercifully spared her face and
head. The physician labored long and
faithfully to alleviate her sufferings, and
finally finding she was rapidly sinking
bared his own arm and severing an artery
transfused a quantity of his own blood
Into the sufferer's veins. She rallied
pnmewhat, but soon relapsed into uncon
sciousness, from which she did not re
cover, although the doctor did not give
up hope until she drew her last breath.
From the appearance of her room it
seems that the muslin curtains at the
windows had become ignited from the gas
jet, and in striving to extinguish the
fire her own clothes had been set ablaze.
Then it was that she screamed for aid af
ter vainly trying to save herself by wrap
ping a blanket about her.
After her death Coroner Hill was noti
fied and after making an investigation al
lowed the body to remain in the house,
lie will hold an inquest to-day.
Miss Moore was a native of San Fran
cisco, and by her father's death about
five years aero she came into possession of
a handsome fortune, which she used lav
ishly in relieving the distress of others.
Phc belonged to several charitable organ
izations and only last Friday was elected
secretary of the Occidental Kindergarten,
in which institution she took a deep inter
est.
They tell of Miss Moore that during the
holidays she started down town to do her
Christmas shopping, hut on the way she
learned of a family that was on the verge
of starvation. She visited the destitute
homo and when she left there were
enough provisions stored within to keep
the wolf away for many weeks. Miss
Moore riid not make the purchases she in
tended, but she brought joy to one family
of little ones, and doubtless derived, far
more happiness in the quiet announce-
ment to her friends that she would not be
able to make any Christmas presents than
she would had she distributed the gifts
she intended.
To-morrow there will be laid to rest in
Home of Peace Cemetery all that is mor
tal of loved and loving Jeannie Moore.
She was 24 years old.
Dr. Jellinek, who fought so heroically to
save the girl's lif .-. is confined to his bed
from the loss of blood he vainly sacrificed
that she might live.

Over a thousand people saw Company

the Santa Rosa High School team at the
Presidio Athletic grounds yesterday after
noon, by a score of 31 to 0, in an ex
citing football game.
The cadets had first kick-off, and opened
negotiations by Whalen scoring a touch- i
down in two and a half minutes after
time was called. Atkinson repeated the
operation and Moreno kicked a goal, j
The features of the first half were Levy's \
forty-yard run Steele's run of forty
yards and D. Ahem s twenty-five-yard
"santa Rosa kicked oft in the second
half. The cadets made the Yale play
of double full back pass from Ewing to
Moreno for eight yards. This is the sec- |
ond time the play has been successfully
made on the Pacific Coast. Moreno
wrenched his leg, and Atkinson took his
place. Svetnich replacing the latter.
"Kid" Mausch performed some brilliant
work in passing quarter and did some fine
uukllng. In this half touch downs were
made by Erlenheim, "Jim' Weir (who
bucked through left tackle), Levy (who
made a flfteen-yard run) and Beasley,
who miide a magnificent run of seventy
yarda around the end. brushing his an

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, JANUARY 23, 1899.
ARRIVAL HERE
OF PROMINENT
EASTERN SPORTS
"Jim" Kennedy at the
Palace.
BRINGS CHAMPION MICHAEL
FRANK ERNE AND TIM HURST
ARE IN THE PARTY.
Erne Is Matched to Meet Dal Haw
kins Here Early in March.
Hurst Tells of Sharkey's
Last Fight.
A P ar t>' Â«Â« gentlemen of more than
ordinary prominence in the sporting
world arrived here late last evening on
the belated Sunset Limited and registered
at the Palace. J. G. Kennedy of New
York of the firm of Brady Vowew &
Kennedy, promoters of theatricals, base
ball > boxing and bicycling, is the leader of
the party, and with him are "Jimmy "
Michael, better known as "the Welsh
Midget," the champion middle-distance
blcycle rider of the wor ] d; Frank Erne
. â¢ rra ., k n^t^i-ht kA^J =-i, .

Wiled to meet Dal Hawkins here on
March 1; Tim Hurst, the famous baso
ball umpire and late referee of the
Sharkey-McCoy fight, and A. E. Welnig
manag er for Michael.
This is the first time any one of the five
has ever visited this city, and they all
come on a combination trip of pleasure
and business. Kennedy is one of the pro
moters of the big indoor cycle tourna
ment to be held in the Mechanics' Pa
vilion from February 11 to 25. Aside from
this he will also manage Erne in any
contests he may be engaged in while here.
A jollier or a more congenial party than
they made as they chatted with a Call re
porter at their rooms at the hotel after
their arrival one would have to go a long
"Tim" Hurst, Famous Baseball Umpire and
Referee of the McCoy-Sharkcy Fight.
way to find. They will remain here sev
eral months, and are bound to make
many friends.
"Jimmy" Michael's reputation as a
bicycle rider had preceded him by a
couple of years, yet it Is hard to realize
that the little, quiet, gentlemanly, fellow,
who smiles so often and says so little, can
reel off mile after mile in a cycle race at
a 1:50 clip and still ask for a faster pace.
He rides at 95 pounds, is less than 5 feet
tall, 23 years of age, and is satisfied to
let his record speak for itself. He will
ride at the coming indoor tournament in
both exhibitions and match races.
Michael lost his pet wheel in the wreck
which his train suffered a couple of days
ago near San Antonio, Tex. He did not
have much to say about it, except to
vouchsafe the statement that it was
smashed, but Kennedy, speaking for him,
said:
"It was about 4 a, m. and our train
was running along at about fifty miles
an hour, when she ran on to a siding at
a little way station and smashed into an
engine that was standing on the siding.
Our tender was forced backward clear
through our baggage car, and Jimmy's
wheel was smashed to pieces. By the
way, it was the first wheel ever carried
over the Sunset Limited. They did not
want to take it as baggage in New York,
but I urged the importance of his having
it here to begin training on immediately
upon his arrival, and they let it come.
We wish they hadn't now. Hurst was In
his berth and was unconscious for five
hours from the concussion. We thought
he was asleep at first. I got my head
badly bupmped, too." Here Kennedy
showed in evidence a knob as big as an
egg on top of his pate.
Michael's forte is middle-distance, paced
match races. He seldom goes Into an
open competition event. But benind a
good triplet or "quad" machine the little
fellow can'follow any speed they can set.
He raced fifteen times in 1897 at distances
of from twenty to thirty-three miles, and
won them all. Michael holds so many
world's records it would take a column to
enumerate them. And whenever a man
can be found who is fast enough to maKe
him try a little harder, he manages to
win and lower his own best previous rec
ord a trifle, so that his limit is yet -o be
re AÂ° E. 'Weinig, who is handling Michael
this year, came with him.
"Jimmy still hankers after the horses,
he said, "and I expect he and Tod Sloan
will be at it together as soon as they
meet. Tod Is teaching him to ride horses
and Jimmy is teaching Tod the bike.
They are very chummy. I am sure Jimmy
will be glad to accept McFarland s chal
lenge for a fifteen-mile race at the com
ing meet, and he will ride against^any
other good man you have out here.
Kennedy states that a big party of
long-distance riders, including Freder
icks. Gimm. Nawn. Aronson, Julius,
Pierce Waller, Lawson, Earl Stevens and
Barnaby, left New York last Friday and
will be here this week. With them as
manager is "Billy" Brady, who is also
Jim Corbetts manager. Brady is on his
wedding trip, and will also help manage
the indoor tournament.
"Of the sprinters." said Kennedy "we
will have Jay Eaton, Teddy Goodman,
JIMMY MICHAEL, THE MIDGET CYCLER.
Harry Elkes, Tom Cooper, besides Eddie
Bald, McFarland and Stevens, who are
already here, and I hope the best of your
coast men. We think a great deal of the
Terrills, Wells, McFarland, Freeman and
Ziegler back East, and I hope they will
get into the competition here. Besides, we
will bring out Henry Fournier with his
petroleum pacing tandem, the fastest ma
chine ever seen on a track, and as for
pacing machines, we have with us five
quints, four quads and innumerable tan
dems and triplets."
Everybody knows Tim Hurst. That is,
everybody who pretends to be anybody
in the world of sport. Tim declares, with
that same mildness of manner and in
genious smile that have made him famous,
that he is out here merely for pleasure.
He says he has not a thing up his sleeve.
Tim has long ago grown so accustomed to
making a statement and not having It
questioned that his say so will have to
be accepted.
Tim Hurst has been identified with base
ball ever since Noah let him out of the
ark. He has been an umpire in the Na
tional League for so long that he can't
remember when he began to call balls
and strikes, but if you will let him tell it.
eight years is the number that, he has
held the indicator. Recently Tim has en
tered the prize ring. Not as a fighter,
for Tim confines his pugilistic tendencies
to the bellicose ball player, but as the
referee of big events. That he has made
a success in this line there is no doubt,
for if there was ever a man that was fair
and square in any game of chance that
man is Timothy Hurst. Only a few days
ago he told off the seconds that saw Kid
McCoy go down to hia first defeat. Tim
speaks of the fight in whispers. This is
a habit that he contracted on the dia
mond when it was necessary for him to
give a close decision against the homo
team. To begin with, Tim says that it
was a great tight, but when asked if the
best man won he dropped his voice down
to such a low whisper that his reply
could not be heard.
"It was like this: McCoy had the chance
of his life in that third round, when he
feinted and then landed on Tom's chin,
sending him to the floor. The sailor was
a bit groggy, but he hit the floor so hard
it brought him to like a flash. There Â«as
a second after Sharkey got on his feet
when a good blow might have caused the
fight to have had a different result, but
the Kid did not take advantage of that
little second. In my mind, the beginning
of the end came in the eighth, when Tom
landed that chance blow on McCoy's
stomach. It took all of the Kid's wind out
of him, half of his confidence and one
fourtn of his science. That blow was just
like being hit by a 13-inch shell. You see,
McCoy was giving away lots of flesh when
he consented or agreed to meet Sharkey,
and Â»â¢ i must remember that the sailor
has improved, and he never stopped com
ing at the Kid during the entire fight.
Miiny were the times when He was stoppea
good and hard, but he did not seem to
mind it, and remained fresn under severe
punishment." M *
Tim was asked what he thought of the
Corbett and Sharkey fight that was to
have been. He shook his head, but he
was quick to agree that a fight must be
a fight and on the square if the sport is to
retain its popularity. Tim has no hes
itancy in saying that he believes if the
sailor and Corbett should meet again
the public would go to witness the mill.
There is one point on which Timothy
Hurst has a lot of good hard sense in his
head, and that is that a pugilist has no
right to go on the stage and pone as an
actor. He distinctly declares that the
ring is the place where the public want
to see a fighter.
"Do you suppose, said Tim. that I
would care to see Sir Henry Irving and
Richard Mansfield in a twenty-round
bout? Well, just reverse my question, and
you know what I think of a prizefighter
on the stage posinÂ«r as an actor."
To-day there is not a man who is more
popular with the general public than Tim
Hurst. Everybody was sorry last season
when he resigned the indicator to man
age the St. Louis Browns, but there will
be great rejoicing this year, for Tim says
he is going to get on the diamond again.
This was predicted by the Eastern press
last October. Tim can no more keep ac
tively out of baseball than he can help
telling a story. By the way. Tim is a
second Chauncey Depew. He can tell more
good jokes in five minutes than most peo
ple can in a whole evening.
Frank Erne, who represents the boxing
end. of the party, is a wonder in many
ways. He is very modest and a quiet
little gentleman. He was born in Swit
zerland,, but has lived in New York most
of his life. He has been fighting since
he was 16, and he is now 24. He keeps in
the lightweight class, generally fighting
at about 130 pounds. He has never been
knocked out, and has never been off his
feet in a fight. He was the first man to
ever get a decision over George Dlxon.
loiter Dixon reversed the situation by
gaining one over him in a twenty-round
bout, and in a third meeting a draw was
declared. He has fought two draws with
George Lavlgno, and has knocked out les
ser lights innumerable. Erne expects to
go into training at once for his fight with
Dal Hawkins on March 1.
"There is some mistake ahout the state
ment that they were going to fight before
the Olympic Club, I find," said Manager
Kennedy, "and it came about this way.
I wired All Ellinghouse that I had match
ed Erne with Hawkins to fight here, and
ns Alf belongs to the Olympics I naturally
thought he would like to see it pulled off
before his club, and therefore told some
Eastern newspaper men that it would be
at the Olympic Club. Now you tell me
the Olympics do not pull off professional
matches any more. If that is the case
any other good club will suit us, and I
am sorry if I used the Olympic's name un
advisedly. Tt was all my mistake."
Charles Miller of New York, champion
six-day and long-distance rider of the
world, arrived also late last evening and
is stopping at the St. Nicholas with John
West, his trainer. West will be remem
bered as the trainer of Tom Cooper, the
sprint racer, for several years past. Mil
ler's record for six days is 200S miles.
Teddy Hale and Prank Albert, the two
six-day men who came in Friday, made
the century ride to San Jose and return
yesterday with "Runt" Smith, "just to
get a bit of exercise," as Hale ex
pressed it.
This city now harbors the three greatest
men in cycle racing in the worldâ Eddie
Bald, short-distance champion; Jimmy
Michael, middle-distance champion, and
Charles Miller, long-distance champion.
The local enthusiasts, therefore, look for
ward to some great sport in their line.
FIRE DRILL EXHIBITION.
An Eastern Expert Watches the Local
â¢ Department at Work.
The water front, near Mission street
wharf No. 2, was alive with firemen yes
terday afternoon. The two firenoats. bat
tery 2 and water-tower No. 2 were all in
action. An exhibition drill was under way
to show the chief Inspector of buildings
in Chicago the workings of Henry Got
ter's inventions.
Chief Sullivan directed the drill, the ob
ject of which was to exhibit the working
of Gotter's new water-tower and Ms now
famous battery. Gotter is the head ma
chinist in the Corporation Yard, and is
rapidly coming into prominence as an in
ventor of fire apparatus.
The visitor was much Impressed, and
spoke commendlngly of the celerity and
skill of the department In its exhibition
performance.
