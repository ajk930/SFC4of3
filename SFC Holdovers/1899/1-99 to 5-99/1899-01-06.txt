AGENTS OF CORRUPTION AT
WORK AT THE CAPITAL
INTIMIDATION AND
BRIBERY BROUGHT
TO BEAR FOR BURNS
Assemblyman Morris Brooke Threatened
and Then Cajoled.
â  â¢
Was Tempted With a Four Years' Office if He
Acceded, and Told That He Would Lose
His Seat if He Refused.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, Jan. 5.â
. One of the blackest pages in the history of California pol
itic? will be printed when the true story is told of the at
tempt of Pan Bums' henchmen to secure the vote of Assembly
man Morris Brooke of Sacramento by bribery and intimidation.
The offenders in this proceeding ought to be speedily indicted
and tried for felony. The Call is in possession of many of the im
portant facts connected with the disgraceful scheme to corral
this Assemblyman for Burns. When the law takes its course
and brings to the bar of justice the men concerned, citizens of
high standing may be compelled to plead to the charge of offer
ing a bribe to influence the vote of a member of the Legislature.
Behind the scenes as the curtain is lifted stands the figure of
. a prominent railroad official, but it is due to his character and
Elding to infer that his part in the transaction was played In
direction of Herrin, the clumsy manipulator in San Francisco.
â¢' the present The Call proposes to tell the story, and the peo
. .â  the guilty.
Assemblyman Brooke's opponent at the last election for
members of the Legislature was William Johnston, but Brooke
was elected to represent the Twenty-second District, receiving
a majority of sixty-one votes.
Shortly after the result was declared proceedings to contest
the election of Brooke were instituted in the Justice Court of
Sacramento. For a time the matter rested. The men who
planned the contest were probably waiting to receive overtures
from the Assemblyman elect, but as no negotiations were in
vited the representative of the railroad corporation appeared on
the scene with a proposition. It must be conceded that he han
dled the affaii .nth more skill and sagacity than a man of Her
rin's mental caliber could suggest. He sought an interview with
Assemblyman-elect Brooke and appointed the Golden Eagle
Hotel as the place of meeting. When the two men came to the
appointed place a general discussion took place with the purpose
on the part of the agent to ascertain if Brooke was wholly com
mitted to the support of any particular candidate for the United
States Senate. The words of the conversation cannot be re
peated, but in the course of the interview the emissary from the
railroad who was doing politics for Dan Burns sprung his prop
osition, but was careful to omit all reference to the name of
Burns or any other candidate. This was the offer made to
Brooke: "If you agree to vote for a certain man for United
States Senator whose candidacy has not been announced we
will see that the contest of William Johnston for your seat will
be abandoned;"
The San Francisco Call.
Mr. Brooke refused to bind himself to any such agreement,
and so the interview closed, but the contest was still maintained.
Later on another agent was sent to see Mr. Brooke and reopen
the negotiations. This time a bribe was introduced to gain the
consent of Brooke to the scheme. Moreover, the name of the
Senatorial candidate on whose behalf the Assemblyman was
sought was disclosed. Here is the substance of the second at
tempt to influence a vote by unlawful means:
"If you will agree to vote for Dan Burns for
United States Senator, Johnston's contest will be
dismissed and you will be able to retain your seat
in the Assembly. If you do not consent to this
proposition you will be unseated, as Burns con
trols the Assembly and can unseat you by holding
up his finger. If you vote for Burns and stay with
him to the finish you can have a place in the County
Clerk's office a?ter t the adjournment- of the Legisla
ture, and you can nold this place a ikl receive a &ood
salary every month for four years."
Then the representative of the railroad company related
that William Hamilton, County Clerk of Sacramento County,
in return for railroad support in his election, had promised to
give J. B. Wright, superintendent of the Southern Pacific
Company at Sacramento, one appointment in the County Clerk's
office. It was explained that Mr. Wright still held the position
at his disposal, and if he (Brooke) would vote for the election of
Burns to the United States Senate he could have the clerkship
as soon as the Legislature adjourned.
The field was therefore opened to Mr. Brooke to vote for
Dan Burns, and as a reward for his vote he would be allowed
to retain his seat in the Assembly and would fall into a nice posi
tion with a good salary when his legislative duties were over.
He was also face to face with threats that if he did not vote
for Burns he would forfeit his office of Assemblyman and get
nothing on the outside.
It cannot be said that the Assemblyman debated in his
mind whether to yield to the influence of bribery and succumb
to the threats of intimidation, but he fully comprehended that he
was in a very distressing position. He desired to do right and
vote according to the dictates of his conscience and a sense of
justice to the people who elected him to the Legislature. Finally
he decided to stand up for his rights, but informed the railroad
agents that he would take the matter into consideration.
The crafty schemers of the railroad and Dan had another
play in reserve. A day or two since a man who is well known
around the Legislature, and who is very close to Jack Wright,
called the Assemblyman aside and in a confidential whisper said:
"Do you know that you are going to lose your seat in the As
sembly? I hear on the inside that if you are not very careful
Johnston will be seated in your place. You had better see some
of your friends at once."
When it was suggested that ex-Senator William Johnston
was not in any way connected with the negotiations and could
not be aware of what was being done by the railroad people, tfie
statement was made that a man came directly from Mr. John
ston to Mr. Brooke with the information for the latter that the
contest would be dismissed if Assemblyman Brooke would
agree to vote for Dan Burns for Senator. This phase of the
proceedings staggered the people who were let into the secret
of the attempt of the railroad crowd. They could hardly believe
that Johnston would advise Brooke to line up with the crowd
for Burns, but such was the message that came from him and
with his assurance that the contest would be dismissed if Brooke
would fall into line.
In this affair the duty of the Assembly of the State of Cali
fornia seems to be plain. It is bad enough for bribe-givers to
haunt the Capitol and barter for the purchase of votes, but it is
worse still to threaten to unseat members if they refuse to obey
the commands of Herrin and the touts behind Burns.
Offers of bribes on one hand, threats to intimidate on the
other. Will the honest, fearless Assemblymen who were chosen
by a free people to represent a decent commonwealth allow a
band of railroad hirelings to invade the State Capitol and "hold
up" the members in this fashion? Little time will be required to
develop all the facts in the case. Assemblyman Brooke can
name the men who approached him with bribes and threats.
There should be in the Legislature men of firm and resolute
purpose to expose and punish the guilty agents of the corrupt
corporation. The penitentiary is yawning.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 5. â It
takes money to make a United
States Senator nowadays, at least
that is what the political advisers
of young Mr. Grant of San Di
ego declare. Having the cour
age of their convictions â and the
money as well â they began by
paying the election expenses of

hard at work trying to get to the
bottom of their employers' sack

To facilitate their plans for

The first station on the road

These two reputable gentlemen
have undisputed access to the
Grant sack, but to them has not
been intrusted the pleasing task
of greasing the palms of needed

Their duties call for the exer

they are intended. The average

The interior of the apartments is

The apartments should have
over the door the motto:
"He who enters here leaves

There is, however, as little
doubt as to the existence of the
apartments as there is concern
ing the purpose to which they
are put. These facts may come
as a shock to the good people of
many districts who went to the
polls on election day and con
scientiously deposited their bal
lots, believing that by so doing
they were assisting in sending
men to the Legislature who
would vote as their consciences
dictated and not as their interests
lay. Mr. Grant's lieutenants
have established these same po
litical madhouses for the very
purpose of blunting consciences
and paying the price for the
same.
DIRECT OFFER OF
MONEY FOR A VOTE
Judge Clough Proffered Fin
ancial Assistance by a
Friend of Grant.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 5. â Here Is a case of at
tempted bribery for the Legislature to
investigate. A crime was committed
by some one in San Francisco, who
wrote a letter to Assemblyman G. G.
Clough of Plumas County, offering to
, pay his election expenses in any sum
ranging from $300 to $500. provided he
would sign a pledge inclosed in the
letter, agreeing to support a certain
candidate for the United States Senate.
The letter was written and mailed in
San Francisco by some one in sym
â  Apathy with the aspirations of r. S.
Grant Jr. for the Be&atonhip, and it
was received by Judge Clough at his
home in Plumas County. Thpp' never
[[was a clearer case of attempted hrili
rry, and if the Legislature has tiny re
paid for the purity of Senatorial elec
tions, it will not hesitate to elicit all
the facts.
To the lasting honor of Judpe Cloush
be it said that he promptly spurned the
offer and wrote a letter in reply, which
shews that he Is a man of sterling in
tegrity. His reply was manly and
characteristic. In substance he wrote
to the bribe-tender: "l acknowledge
the receipt of your letter containing an
offer to Durchase my vote for United
States Senator by the payment of my
election expenses. My expenses in the
campaign have not exceeded tin- price
of the two-cent postage stamp on this
letter of reply, and the amount is
therefore too small to take into con
sideration. Rather than sell my vote
In the Legislature on this or any other
question, I would take my bag of
bread in one hand and my staff in the
other and so travel through my dis
trict."
During the past twenty-four hours
the Grant campaign managers have re
sorted to all the methods known to the
adroit and subtle to induce Judge
Clough to return the original letter
from San Francisco wherein an offer
was made to buy his vote.
It is significant that disclosures of at
tempted bribery come to-day from two
Senatorial camps. The railroad agents
who are behind Burns are seeking by
the offer of bribes and the utterance of
throats to induce Assemblyman Brooke
of Sacramento to line up for Dan. The
Grant managers are now face to face
with the knowledge that their over
tures to obtain votes by unlawful
means are known to leading men in the
State.
It makes but little difference so far
as the law is concerned, or, indeed, in a
moral sense, whether the bribe tendered
consists of coin in hand or the promise
of official emolument. In either case
the offer is corrupt and tends to bring
disgrace on the State and scandal on
the Legislature.
Little attempt has been made to con
ceal the fact that Milton Green and
James Brown have been disbursing
money in the interest of U. S. Grant of
San Diego. It is an open secret that
these men contributed to the campaign
expenses of several of the successful and
quite a number of defeated candidates j
for the Legislature. It was known dur- j
ing the campaign that Green was!

quont events it is now clear that U. B.
Grant and several of his associates
were in possession of the secret agree- !
ment of the railroad *to support Burns, i
and therefore a watch was kept on
Grant's money-spending campaign.
To-night it is said that D. M. Burns j
is asserting with no little emphasis that
! some one will go to the penitentiary.
Among the reports circulated is one
with the color of truth, which holds
that Burns sent a spy Into Grant's j

managers bought the recruit. The spy j
I returned to Burns with the proof that

The situation here is so full of peril

State of. California that the leading eit
; lzens of the commonwealth should ask
: for a conference with their neighbors,

and encouragement to the loyal and !

ters to count. The candidates who
have resorted to bribery and corruption
are sending home for reinforcements
from the ranks of the place hunters.
The low down element of society are
coming to Sacramento to help Burns.
Paid lobbyists are silently serving
Grant and spending his money to cor
rupt the legislator. Good men in the
Legislature, astounded at the specta
cle, wonder what has become of the
moral forces of California. Instead of
sending letters cities and counties
should send their foremost citizens to
the front. The disclosures of to-day
may alarm the State and cause an
awakening of the masses. Other let
ters, similar to that received by As
semblyman Clough, may be brought
forth, as there is not the slightest doubt
of their existence. There have* been
no gains of strength for Grant or Burns
during the past twenty-four hours.
It transpired late to-night that Dan
T. Cole wrote the letter to Judge
Clouch asking the latter to sign a
pledge to vote for U. S. Grant for the
United States Senate, and offering as
a condition of such signing to pay
Clough's campaign expenses.
The knowled â that Cole wrote the
letter came out In this manner. Short
ly after the election Judge Clough told
a prominent Senator that an attempt
had been made to bribe him to vote
for Grant. The Senator asked Clough
to narrate the circumstances of the at
tempted briberâ and thereupon the lat
ter said he had received a letter from
Dan T. Cole offering to pay campaign
expenses in consideration of a vote for
Grant. Upon receiving this informa
tion, the Senator went to San Frun
cisco and there told Milton Green and
other Grant managers that if such
methods were pursued as that men
tioned by Judge Clough serious trou
ble would come to Grant.
Evidently Dan T. Cole was called in
' to square the transaction with the
â  Plumas County Assemblyman. The
i record of corresponderce in The Call's
' possession shows that Cole's letter was
written prior to December 8, 189 S. as on
that date Judge Clough wrote a re
sponsive letter to Cole's explanation.
' It seems that Cole sought to smooth the
' matter over by saying that Clough was
' an old friend and a poor man who was
[ deserving of financial assistance. Judge
â  Clough's reply does not in any sense
5 refute the statement that Cole made
â  the offer to pay campaign expenses.
' Here is a copy of the letter sent to
' soothe Cole:
QUINCY, Dec. 8, 1898.
Hon. Dan T. Cole â Dear Friend
â¢ ! Dan: I never said to any one that
l you offered me a bribe for any pur
-1 pose, and never thought of such a
â  thing. You should know this with
; out being told. I thank you for
[ recommending me to a place on the
judiciary committee. I fear there are
many men better qualified for chair
man. I trust after our long ac
quaintance you will never believe I
make any remarks demoralizing to
you. It is* impossible that I can
visit San Francisco before the ses
sion, but if I do, shall of course call
|on you. Yours very truly,
G. G. CLOUGH.
i To-night the Grant managers blame
General Barnes for exploiting the let
| ter. As a matter of fact The Call did
I not get its information from any can
i didate for Senator and is In a position
| to give General Barnes more light on
the subject than he has ever received.
The simple fact that the controversy
as to the real meaning of Cole's ad
! vances was in progress as early as De
cember 8, and that several days if not
weeks before that time the secret was
! out, ought to absolve General Barnes
from any blame for bringing the corre
spondence to the attention of the press.
However, Dan T. Cole addressed to
night the following letter to General
! Barnes:
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 5, 1899.
To General W. H. L. Barnes â Dear
| Sir: I understand you are threaten
ing to exploit a letter written by me
to Judge G. G. Clough after his
nomination to the Assembly. I un
derstand, furthermore, you, while
pretending to regret "dragging the
honored name of Grant through the
slime of politics," feel it your
"bounden duty" to besmear the son
of General Grant for the purpose of
advancing your own Senatorial aspi
rations.
This is to notify you that the letter
written by me to Judge Clough was
! not written with the knowledge or
HOSE .GUrtST HAS went"
i consent of Mr. Grant or of either or
; any of his managers. I have known
â¢ Judge Clough for a great many years.
: I also felt a cteep interest in Mr.
â  Grant's campaign, and sought to
serve him whenever I might honor
ably do so.
If you insist on coupling the name
of Grant, or either of his managers,
witn the letter to Judge Clrugh or
with me, I uesire that you do so with
full notice that they are in no way
responsible for it and had no knowl
edge of it. DAN T. COLE.
Milton Green is so much alarmed over
' c turn affairs have taken that he
now throws the whole blame of the at
tempted bribery on Dan T. Cole. To
night he writes this rather remarkable
letter to shield Grant:
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 5, 1899.
If any letter was written to Judge
Clough by Dan T. Cole offering him
financial assistance in his campaign,
it was wholly witiiout the knowledge
of Mr. Grant or of any one connected
with his campaign, and any such
financial assistance, if accepted,
would have been rendered out of the
private funds of Mr. Colo himself.
MILTON J. GREENE.
Can any member of the Legislature
remain indifferent to the demand for
immediate investigation when he reads
these foregoing letters in referenc to
the subject?
Can the Legislature hesitate to de
mand the production of the letter which
Cole wrote to Judge Clough offering
to pay from $300 to $500 if the Assem
blyman would vote for Grant? Is Dan
T. Colo purchasing Grant votes for his
own amusement and pastime? Does
his salary in the United States Mint
Justify him in making such unsolicited
tenders of financial assistance to old
friends?
To-night the wires carry the news to
every city in the United States that a
Federal office holder employed in the
San Francisco Mint offered to bribe a
member of the California Legislature
to vote for U. S. Grant for United
States Senator. The topic is now a
national scandal, and the eyes of the
whole country are on the Legislature
now in session here.
If over the fair fame of California
was involved it is now. The time has
Come for the masses of honest and
patriotic citizens of the State, for farm

sional men, to speak out in favor of

THE EXAMINER POLL
A BARE-FACED FAKE
Raw Work by a Reporter of the
Yellow Paper.
Indignant Denials and Protests Entered by Nearly All
of Those Quoted as Favoring
Dan Burns.
CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. s.â The names of twenty
five Assemblymen and six Senators were
printed by the Examiner this morning
as the thirty-one legislators who will
"admit at this time that they intend
to vote for Colonel Dan Burns for
United States Senator."
The publication was made as a part
of a poll of the Legislature on the Sen
atorial question and the whole was one
of those rare fakes for which that pa
per is noted.
Of the thirty-one Senators and As
semblymen who are credited in the Ex
aminer fake poll as having admitted
that they intended to vote for the col
onel, there were but two who could be
found to-day who stated that they had
made any such admission, and those
two were Senator Bettman and Assem
blyman Kenneally of San Francisco.
A large majority of the remaining
twenty-nine said they never had been
either questioned or approached by a
representative of the Examiner and in
terrogated as to their choice for Sena
tor.
There were two who had been inter
rogated, but they had informed the Ex
aminer representative that they had
formed absolutely no choice for Sena
tor as yet, and furthermore they did
not intend to give exnression to any in
dividual choice or preference until the
time for balloting came.
The publication of these thirty-one
names of Senators and Assemblymen
as acknowledged supporters of Burns'
will work cruel injustice in some cases,
and it certainly did cause a great deal
of indignation among those who had
been credited as admitting their prefer
ence for Burns, when they never had
done so.
These legislators put in the day en
tering denials to the allegation and de
nounced the publication as a fake of
the first water. They were in many in
stances most emphatic in the language
they used because of the false light in
which they had been placed, not only
before their own constituents, but be
fore the people of the whole State.
Among those who were most indig
nant was Senator Da^is of Amador
County. The Senator, in discussing the
subject, said:
"I have never talked "with any re-
| porter or any one else about voting for
Colonel Burns. I am not in a position
to do so. The man whom I think should
be sent to the United States Senate i
from California is Irving M. Scott, and j
if we can but get him into the tontest
I think he is far and away the best of I
any or all of the candidates now in the !
field. In my judgment this matter of
electing a Senator should be governed j
not by what is best for us as individ- I
uals, but what is best for the State of
California. There can certainly be no
question that the best interests of this
State would be subserved by the elec
tion of Irving M. Scott, if we can only
get him into the contest. Feeling as I
do in this matter you can see how it
would be impossible for me to state
that I was for Colonel Burns."
Senator E. I. Wolfe of San Francisco '
was also credited as being among those I
who had announced their intention to j
vote for the colonel. Senator Wolfe, in j
speaking of the matter, indignantly
Bald:
"I have never infor.ned anybody as to
whom I intended to vote for for United !
i States Senator. I am not in anybody's j
I camp. The Senate is not balloting for !
! a United States Senator at present and
I I have not yet determined upon my
I choice. This is not the time for declara
ttonfl to be made, in my judgment."
Assemblyman Grove L. Johnson was
also in the list of "admitting ones."
Mr. Johnson denied that he had ever
I stated to any human being the name
I of the man he intended to vote for for
Senator.
I Assemblyman Knight of Sacramento
County made the same statement that
Mr. Johnson did. Both were approached
by an Examiner representative and
asked to express a preference for Sena
tor, but both declined to do so. where
upon they were recorded by that paper
as "admitting that they intended to
vote for the colonel."
Assemblyman Dibble of San Fran
cisco never at any time stated that he
intended to vote for the colonel.
Assemblyman Devoto of San Fran
cisco was greatly incensed at having
been credited with "admitting" that he
intended to vote for the colonel. He
never at any time made any such state
ment, in fact he has at no time ex
pressed a Senatorial preference.
Assemblyman Knowland of Alameda
County was in the poll as an "admit
ting" Burns man. Mr. Knowland never
made any such admission and has not
given expression as to his Senatorial
choice to any one.
Assemblyman Cargill of San Benito
was among those misrepresented. He
has as yet formed no preference.
Assemblyman Rickard of San Fran
cisco stated that he had never declared
himself for any candidate for Senator,
but had repeatedly stated that he in-^
tended to vote for the caucus nominee*
Not until he was called upon to vote
did he intend to announce his choice.
Assemblyman Kelsey of Santa Clara
County said he had never taken any
body into his confidence as to whom he
intended to vote for and declared he
was absolutely unpledged.
Assemblyman Arnerich of Santa
Clara denied absolutely that he had
ever informed anybody that he intended
to support Burns for Senator.
Assemblyman Cobb of San Francisco
said: "I have never declared to any
body whom it is my intention to sup
port for Senator."
Assemblyman Raub of Sutter County
never expressed himself on the Sena
torial proposition.
Senator Hoey of San Francisco stated
that he had never given expression to
Senatorial preference and no Examiner
man ever pretended to question him in^
regard to the matter.
Senator Burnett of San Francisco de
nied absolutely that he had ever OX
any time told anybody whom it was
his intention to vote for. He was not
prepared to state yet the man of his
choice.
And so it was all the way down the
line. Various Senators and Assembly
men were published as having deelar- I
for Grant, Bulla, Beale, Knight or Fel
ton. In some few instances it is true
that legislators have expressed prefer
ences, but the poll was simply the com
pilation of a member of the Kscar
staff, based upon no actual information
or data whatever, but made up as he
thought the vote might be upon the
first ballot, and printed for the purpose
of bolstering up the candidacy of the
man from Mexico.
But the publication of the fake failed
of its purpose. It has resulted in mak
ing about twenty- five as angry states
men as can be found gathered in any
capital city in the United States. Al
ready some of them are receiving tele
grams from their constituents asking if
they have been correctly placed by the

Those unhappy legislators have been

"MAGE" M C LAUGHLIN
IN A NEW ROLE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. s.â "Mage" McLaughlln,
manipulator of the golden feather and
political Pooh-Bah at the throne of Al
calde Burns, came out in a nice new role
here this eveningâ that of political high
wayman. Moral suasion and that "ur
bane manner" that has made "Mace"
famous from Oroville to Santa Cruz have
failed to do much business in the way of
Burns votes since the Mexican coterie
descended on the Golden Eagle bar la
fact, any good old political "has been**
could have effected just as much in th%
same time, and it has become apparent
to the whole push that what cannot be
had for the askingâ 01- for that matter
the buyingâ must perforce be had by
other means. Force was necessary and
force must be used. It was new business
for the "Mage." The good old con was
more to his liking, but it was one of the
penalties of his unholy associations and

It was emphasized by another smash at

jnent of the appraiser's office when he
. deigns to be there; Lynch, who draws
â â  fcalajy as Collector, and Jake Ptep-
Richer. As to the latter Jake, I made
..â¢mention yesterday morning, perhaps
â¢'.father too hard. During the campaign
: he warmed a chair in the headquarters
â '.of Burns, supposed at the time to he
the headquarters of the Republican
â¢..committee. He was a Burns disciple
then and he is one yet. The four of
â¢them ought to be chased home. They
;iia,ve no legitimate occupation here.
â .They are presumptuous interlopers,
â¢ hungry for a new brand or pie, while
' already gorged. Their check is beyond

and wholly undeserved jobs they neg
lect these to reach for others. They

That they are here to work for Burns
' reeds no saying. They are rooting for

ar.e keen for the swill he is expected to
pour into the trough as an invitation to
. them to enter with four feet. There
should be a ring in the snout of each.
'..All Burns men look alike to me. Yet,
it must be acknowledged that there are
many of them. They do not proclaim
'themselves always, but they gather in

drink bad liquor to the health of their

has stuck to his friends. Yet there

.State. Columbus Waterhouse had been
â¢his friend, and Waterbouse died with
â a curse on his ashen lips for this man
Burns, the man who sticks to his
â¢friends. All this talk of Burns is sick
ening. The Legislature may elect him,
b"u"t every vote in his favor will be a
disgrace to the person casting it, and
â¢.stamp him either corrupt or as near a
â¢fool as one can be and avoid the asy
lum. In fact, the Mexican seems to
have no respectable following worth
â¢considering. There are in it no repre
sentative citizens. Merchants, bank
â¢ ers, farmers have no use for him. The
mob at his heels is made up of touts,
gamblers, rounders, Gunsts and deluded
pents. Nevertheless, they make an
army so mighty that they may yet

THE PRESIDENT IS NOT
SUPPORTING BURNS
WASHINGTON, Jan. 5.â -The news has reached here that an at
tempt is being made by certain politicians now in Sacramento to cre
ate th>- Impression th?t it Is the desire of the national administra
tion t ;;,, n fl f D. M. Burns of San Francisco to the
United States Bei ate. Tho rumor has piven rise to considerable com
ment, for th^ reason that at this moment all eyes are turned to
ward the Pacific <\,ast on account of matters connected with na
tional policy touching the final disposition Ot. recently conquered ter
ritory in the Orient.
Inquiry marie to-day developed the information, the reliability of
which is not to br ; questioned, that the President has been asked by
certain Californians to gjlve support to Burns 1 Senatorial candidacy,
but that he had steadfastly refused to take any part for or against
Burns or any one else. It was also ascertained that the President
has not been asked, nor has r,e granted permission for any Federal
employe to take part in the Senatorial campaign in California. It
may be stated on authority that if an effort is being made by Fed
eral employes in California to create the impression that the national
administration is assisting the candidacy of any one, it is being done
without authority and without the knowledge or consent of the chief
executive.

are regulated by their moods and that
the sun dares not peep above the hori
zon until their consent has been gained.
Naturally they believe a reporter has
no right to be on earth. Leavitt of
Oakland is of this ptyle. When asked
whether he intended to vote for Burns
he became furious. He acted as though
an i-ndeavor had been made to find out
whether he intended to raid a henroost.
Really, the reporter had sought legiti
mate information and yet it is hardly
strange that in the face of the implied
accusation Leavitt should have felt a
(lush of resentment. There was, how
ever, nothing to keep him from replying
unless a fear that he might incriminate
himself. If he intends to vote for Burns
no wonder he is ashamed of it, but
there was no occasion for him to put
his rancor on exhibition.
Sip. Bettman said to-night that the

as usual, everybody in search of in
formation, and few giving it. As a
matter of fact knowledge concerning
the Senatorial situation is meager, and
my guess is as good as that of an
other.
Th^ "â¢poll" taken by the Examiner |
and printed as showing: Dan Burns In j
the lead turns out to have been a prac- <
tical joke. The gentleman who com- )
piled it did so without first ascertain-
Ing the sentiments of the Senators and !
Assemblymen supposed to be emoted. '
That it was from beginning: to end a i
tabulated fake is made cloar in the |
news columns. Members were accred-
Ited to the Burns column when they ':
had not even been asked for an ex- !
pression, and open avowals that they â

were for somebody else -were not sufil- i
cient to keep their names off the black- |
list. Given a piece of paper and a pen. |
and smothering the natural regard for |
veracity, it is easy to elect anybody.
I marvel that the two houses were not I
made unanimous for Burns. There are j
few journals that can afford to indulge j
in these melancholy jests, but with the I
peculiar advantage of ha vine no repu
tation to lose, the Examiner can do so. !
I trust that the next "Blinker" com
ments will toast to a turn the Individ- j
aaJ who polled so boldly and so ill.
Another matter jsuggested painfully i
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 6, 1899.
is that there are headquarters here for
the Republican Central Committee, pre
sided over by Major McLaughlin, paid
for by the party and used exclusively
as a steering headquarters for Burns.
No favors are extended there except in
exchange for a promise of support fcr
the Candelaria schemer. Aspirants for
committee chairmanships are told by
the affable major that they will either
support Burns or be turned down.
The trickery, wire-pulling subterfuges,
bribery and intimidation are as grossly
in evidence here as in the shameful de
velopment of the Dennery fraud, .some
particulars of which have reached here
this evening, along with Dennery him
self, although he did not bring them.
The question seems to be whether
Burns is bigger than the party or the
party so much smaller than Burns that
it must be flouted, bullied, cowed, dis
graced by the agents of this citizen of
bad record, whose supremacy wcruld in
dicate rottenness and whose election
would put this great State to scorn. In
decency the headquarters should be
closed or forced to put out a sign. A
fitting emblem for it would be a photo
graph of an ex-Secretary of State
couchant behind the bars of a jail and
people rampant, with $31,000 just be
yond reach. As a background there
could be a Mexican prison, with a trail
leading to the door of the Capitol at
Washington, and inscribed over all the
legend: "I'm a bitter pill, but you
take your medicine."
PROMPT WORK DONE
IN BOTH HOUSES
The Printing Office Can Do
Business immediately.
The Senate Has Decreed That It
Will Be a Dry Ball This Tear.
The Appellate Court Bill
Up for Action.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. s.â The Legislature has de
monstrated that it can act promptly
If occasion requires, for to-day the Senate
took up Assembly bill No. 1, appropriat
ing $50,000 as an emergency for the ope
ration of the State Printing Office until
the regular appropriation is made. The
bill came over from the lower house this
morning, was taken up a few minutes
later, and was passed within a half hour
of its reception by a unanimous vote. No
amendments were offered, and not the
slightest inclination was shown to block
its passage. As soon as the Governor
signs it the State Printer will have ample
funds at his disposal for the Immediate
needs of his office.
None of the juice of the California
grape will be served at the banquet,
which has always been a welcome feature
of the inaugural ball. The Senate has
settled that. This does not necessarily
mean that the guests must nurse their
thirst until they get downtown, but it will
put them to the inconvenience of visiting
the private "well," which it is fxpected
will be fully established by that time.
Senator Cutter is responsible for the
change in the plans of the citizens of Sac
rnnonto having charge of the ball. When
the Senate met this morning one of the
first matters to be taken up was the As
srmbJy ' resolution placing the Capitol at
the disposal of the committee from the
time of adjournment, Saturday, until
Tuesday morning.
Cutter offered an amendment providing
that no wine, beer or other intoxicants
should be served at the supper. He re
ferred to previous affairs of the kind, at
which the waiters became intoxicated and
a genera] state of hilarity prevailed. He
said it was the intention of the committee
to spend $SOO for wines, which, he esti
mated, would purchase GOO pints of me
very best brand of champagne.
Bettman Of San Kraneisco remarked
that it was intended to serve nothing but
still wines, whereupon Cutter rejoined
that it only ma<if the matter worse, for
1800 w<ml<l "purchase enouph still wine to
intoxicate every guest and attendant at
the ball.
The amendment was agreed to without
'â¢;.; "sition, find now those who oount on
attending the ball next Monday niÃiu
must either cache a bottle somewhere or
patronize the "well."
About the only other feature of
the session of the Senate v.as the
maiden speech of C. M. Bhortridge.
There is something remarkable about
the new Senator's flow of oratory.
!! seems to dry up at times, some
thing like a mountain brook, and then
suddenly burst forth again and bubbles
on and on until another season of mi n
tal drought sets In.
During these arid periods Senator
Bhortridge appears to enter into a sort of
hypnotic state; his eyes close and his
features relax with a repose resembling
those at Joe Storms when asleep. This
comparison is made with npoloify t<> the
pride of the Chutes. The Santa dura
Senator's speech was delivered in the in
terest of Morehouse's resolution provi l
ing for the purchase of forty-five copies
of the constitution and codes for th<
of the officers and members. Senator
Phortridge created a sensation amo:iK
the members and his eloquence was smM
cient to change his own position, so that
when a vote was finally taken Short
ridge was recorded with the others and
the volumes will be purchased.
President pro tern. Flint presided In the
absence of Lieutenant Governor Neft".
Immediately upon assembling a message
was received from the Assembly an
nouncing; the passage of Assembly bill
1 and the adoption of Assembly resolu
tions 1 and 3. On motion of Cutter of
j Yuba Assembly joint resolution 1, indors
ing the national administration's conduct

1 policy and instructing the California Sen
i ators to vote for the ratification of the
i treaty of peace was taken up.
The resolution was referred to a special
I committee of three, consisting of Davis.

i resolutions bearing on the subject, includ-
I ing Senator Perkins' communication to
the Legislature.
Assembly concurrent resolution No. 3,
! directing the Secretary of State to place
the Capitol building at the disposal of the
i inaugural ball committee from the hour
| of adjournment Saturday until Tuesday
! morning was taken up and adopted with
| Cutter's amendment prohibiting the serv
i Ing of wines, beer or other intoxicants at
< the supper.
Assembly bill No. 1, making an emer
gency appropriation of $50,000, was then
\ taken up. Cutter's motion to suspend the
! provisions of the constitution In order
that the bill might be passed to-day was
carried and the bill was read the first,
second and third times and finally passed,
all within ten minutes.
Smith's resolution allowing each member
â  $2f) for contingent expenses was adop'.ed,
! and then Cutter called up the Assembly
| resolution relative to the improvement if
I the Sacramento River in accordance with
| the report of the Board of Federal En-
I gineers, now on file in Washington, and
requesting the California delegation in
Congress to strive to have the Federal
Government adopt and execute them. It
was- adopted.
Leavitt of Alameda offered a resoh
tion which was adopted that when th
Senate adjourns It do so as a mark of n
spect to the memories of the late Sena
tors E. S. Denison and J. H. Mahoney.
A. S. Langley was appointed one of 1
official stenographers by a vote of 24 to
the first division of the session.
The Secretary of State was instructs
to purchase forty-five copies of the pocko
edition of the constitution and codes, ant
the sergeant-at-arms to purchase nece
sary bill files.
In the afternoon a message was r
ceived from the Assembly announcing th
adoption of Assembly concurrent resolu
tion Xo. 4 in relation to the improvement
of the Sacramento River, being the same
as the resolution adopted by the Senate in
the morning. An adjournment to 10 a. m.
to-morrow was then taken.
TWO IMPORTANT MATTERS.
The Assembly Is Anxious to Have
the Nicaragua Canal Built
by the Government.
I CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. s.â The Assembly this
morning was called upon to consider two
matters of great importance to the State
cf -California. One, the creation of an
appellate court, the other a concurrent
1 resolution introduced by Caminetti, of the
| minority, announcing 1 to President Mc
; Kinley and Congress that it is the wish of
I the people of this State tnat the Govern
'< ment of the United States build and ope
! rate the Nicarag. canal.
The creation of a court of appeals was
brought up by Grove L. Johnson of Sac
ramento as an amendment to section 6
of the State constitution. It was handed
up to the clerk's desk, but Its reading
was dispensed with and it was sent to
the printer. Its creative sections are as
follows:
Sfction 25. In addition to courts heretofore
i established and now existing under the constl
! tutlon there shall he a court to be known ,â !,"=
j the Appellate Court, to consist of a Chief
i Justice and four Associate Ju.-tlces possessing
! the qualifications required In Justices of the
i Supreme Court. The Appellate Court shall al
i ways be open for the transaction of business
and shall hold Its regular sessions at such times
and places as may be prescribed by law. Any
1 three Justices may hear and finally decide any
cause or matter within Its Jurisdiction; pro-
I vided, that when a cause has been orally ar
, gued the concurrence of at least three Justices
, who have heard thÂ« argument shall be ncceb
sary to a decision.
Section 26. The Justices of the Appellate
; Court- shall be elected by the qualified elec
j tors of the State at large at the general State
! election? at the times and places at \m Ich
State officers are elected, and the term of of
; fice shall be ten years from and after the first
Monday after the first day of January next
I succeeding their election: provided, that the
â  five Justices elected at the first election after
1 the adoption of this amendment shall, at their
, first meeting, so classify themselves by lot
, that one of them shall go out of office at the
| end of two years, one of them at the end of
four years, one of them at the end of six years,
one of them at the end of eight years and one
of them at the end of ten years. The one
drawing the shortest term Khali be Chief Jus
tice and at the end of his term shall be suc
ceeded by the one drawing the next, shortest
term If he still be in office, or otherwise by
I the Justice; oldest In commission. Afterward
the Justice holding under the oldest commis
sion shall be Chief Justice.
.Section 27. The Appellate Court shall have
; final and' appellate Jurisdiction on questions of
: law alone in all criminal cases prosecuted by
i indictment or information in a court of record
| and in all actions at law founded In tort com-
I menced in the Superior Court. The court shall
also have the power to Issue writs of manda
mus, certlorari and prohibition to the Superior
Courts in and concerning the cases In which
It has appellate Jurisdiction.
The compensation is fixed at $6000 each
per year, but section 32 provides that no
Justice of the Appellate Court shall be al
lowed to draw his monthly salary unless
i he shall make affidavit that no cause in
his court remains undecided that ha? been
submitted for a longer period than ninety
days.
Camlnetti'a resolution was not debated,
but upon his own motion was referred to
the Committee on Foreign Relations,
when that committee shall have been ap
| pointed. It provides as follows:
Whereas, There is now pendlnK in the Con
gress of the Vnlted States a proposition to se
cure the construction of the Nicaragua canal.
\YhÂ«"-t-ns, 'li" State of California will be ma
terially benefited by the construction thereof,
therefore be It
Resolved. By the Assembly, the Senate con
curring, that we respectfully and urgently re
quest Congress to provide for the construction
of said canal by the Government of the United
States, to be owned and operated by it, thus
securing to our country the great benefit of a
short and cheap waterway between the Atlan
tic and Pacific oceans, open to all our people
on equal terms without discrimination.
Resolved, That the Governor of the State of
' California is respectfully requested to trans
! Mit a copy of these resolutions to the Presi
; dent of the United States, the Senate, the
! House cf Representatives and the California
I delegation In Congress.
The temporary report of the Committee
i on Rules was read and adopted. It pro
vides for thirty-nine standing committees,
and makes little change in the rules of
last session.
Cobb of San Francisco moved to amend
the report by making' the San Francisco
delegation a standing committee of elgh
i teen members, but his proposition was
warmly objected to by a number of the
: country members. "When it came to a
vote the Los Angeles delegation stood
alone with the San Franciscans, and the
! motion was lost.
A message from Governor Gage an
! nounoed to the Assembly that he had se
lected W. I. Foley as his private secre-
t ary, and that thereafter all business com
; munications must come to him through
: that channel.
Pierce of Yolo introduced a concurrent
| resolution approving the work and plans
: for tho improvement of the Sacramento
1 River by the Sacramento River Oommis-
I tion, and recommending that Congress
; take action favorable to the consumma
tion of the plan of improvement arranged.
The resolution was adopted, and on mo-
I tion of Dibble an adjournment was taken
: until 9:30 to-morrow morning.
A TRAITOR IN
THE BULLA CAMP
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. s.â There Is a traitor in !
the Bulla camp.
This startling discovery was made this [
morning', and it came like a thunderbolt j
out of a clear sky, for Senator Bulla and j
those of his supporters whom he knows
absolutely and beyond any question to
be true to him and his candidacy never i
for a moment suspected treachery. The
truth of the matter Is that Senator j
Bulla's supporters are not so numerous j
that it is impossible to keep close watch
upon them and prevent them from going ;
astray. But it seems that in an un
guarded moment of overconfidence in the !
absolute good faith of all the Bulla men
some one of them was possessed of
enough treachery and cunning to obtain :
all the details of the plan of campaign !
the Bulla forces adopted at the caucus ,
they held yesterday afternoon, deliver |
them over to Milton Green, the manager |
of the Grant campaign, receive whatever
reward was his due and escape without
discovering his identity.
Not until noon to-day did the Bulla men
find this out, and then was the treachery [
very foolishly uncovered by Manager
Green himself. Early this morning Mr.
Green called for a conference with As- 1
semblymen Valentine and Mellick of Los
Angeles County, the two most ardent sup- j
porters Bulla has. In the course of con- !
versation Green disclosed to Valentine
and Mellick that he was fully cognizant
of absolutely everything that transpired
at the Bulla caucus yesterday afternoon. <
He told the surprised Los Angeles County
statesmen details of what had transpired i
which thos<? attending the caucus ha<i ;
solemnly pledged themselves to reveal to
no one, under any circumstances.
Assemblymen Valentine and Mellick lis
tened, with their eyes and ears strained
us they heard the secrets of the caucus
divulged to them in the camp of the !
enemy by the opposing general.
After Mr. Green had finished they j
accused him of having secured the in
formation through underground sources,
but he denied it. Unfortunately for Mr.
Green, he had gone too far, and Messrs.
Valentine and Mellick knew that some
one who attended the caucus had been
guilty of treachery.
Immediately another caucus of the
Bulla men was held. The facts which
had been divulged to Mr. Green were of
no positive injury to Bulla's interests,
but it had the effect of making it neces
sary to change the plan upon which it
had been decided to conduct the remain
der of the Bulla campaign for the Sen
atorship.
At the caucus this morning the state
ment was simply made that some mem
ber of it had failed to observe his pledge
of secrecy. No charge's were made
against any individual, as no proof was
at hand to establish who the party was
who had made the disclosures to Green.
There are two men in the I,os Angeles
County delegation under suspicion. bur-
Ing the balance of the Senatorial fight
Senator Bulla'p true friends will be more
guarded In their counsels, and the two
parties from the Senator's county wno
are referred to will bf let In only as to
such information as the Bulla managers
are perfectly willing Mr. Green or any
one else should have.
Senator Bulla received some reinforce
ments to-day from I,os Angeles. Council
man Charles H. Toll and George H. Stew
art, a prominent business man, arrived at
the Golden Eagle, and will remain until
the Senatorial fight is closed to do all they
can to further the interests of Mr. Bulla.
Both these gentlemen are representative
citizens of Southern California.

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 5.
Not for several years has there been
such a largely attended meeting as that
of the Oakland Ministerial Union this
afternoon. It was a special meeting, and
the important business before it was the
discussion regarding the possible damning
of the standing of California in the East
by the election of D. M. Burns to the
X*'nited States Senate.
There were some very fiery speeches made
when the above resolution was brought
up. They were all of the same nature,
and set forth in language that could not
be misunderstood that the Senators and
tlon, the bill providing for which he will
shortly introduce.
Mr. Valentine, when seen, indignantly
denied the story and stated that while it
was true that he would introduce the
Paris Exposition bill the clause provid
ing for the appointment of commissioners
would expressly provide that only par-
ties of experience In the management of
exposition matters could be named as
commissioners.
"You â¢will, therefore, see," said Mr. Val
entine, "that by my own bill I will dis
qualify myself from service as a commis
sioner, inasmuch as I have never had any
experience in exposition matters."

a joint caucus of the Democratic members of the Senate and

Jesse Walters Shot and
Dangerously Wounded
by Al Cook.
Returns the Fire and Sends a

of His Assailant.
NAPA, Jan. 5.â A duel to the death
occurred this forenoon in the McKen

or other the men quarreled. The dead
ly encounter of to-day is supposed to
have been the result of that old and
long standing feud.
Jesse Walters is a prominent citizen,
being well known throughout Napa j
Valley. He has in the past served as
a Constable in Tount Township, and
acted as a Deputy Sheriff under Sheriff j
McKenzie. His doctors report that his
wound is a serious one, but that he is
doing as well as could be expected.
Al Cook, the dead man, was an Eng
lishman, formerly employed in St. He
lena. He was quite well known there, j
though a comparative stranger In i
Napa.
Mr. Walters was interviewed by The
Call correspondent this afternoon. â¬ HÂ«
said:
"I was standing in front of Har
graves' this forenoon when I paw
George McKenzie cross the street and
go into his livery stable. I wanted to
see him, so I walked down there and
went back into the stable, where Mr.
Metcalf and Mr. McKenzie were talk
ing. I joined them and was speaking
of buying a harness or something,
when some one commenced shooting at
me. The others ran out. but at the
second shot. I think, a bullet struck my
Ir-tr and T fell forward. Then I drew
my pistol and commenced shooting at
the fellow, who stood in the doorway
of the box stall. I dnn't know how
many shots T fired. I then walked out
nr.d was taken to the Courthouse. If
he's the fellow they say he is, T knew
him a few years ago. I turned him off
my place, and the last words he said
to me at that time was that he'd get
even with me if It cost him twenty
years in Pan Quentin to accomplish it.
I didn't know he was in the stable when
I went in there. I have always been
a good citizen, have always paid my
debts and believe that I am justified in
what happened to-day."
Dr. Hennessey was seen to-day. He
says that Walters' wound Is a very
had one. It is liable to either stiffen
the leg or necessitate amputation.
Coroner Kyser will hold the inquest
at the Courthouse to-morrow morning
at 10 o'clock.
MARTIN AND THE
COUNCIL CLASH
Strife Among San Jose
Officials.
MAYOR NAMES A TREASURER
CITY TRUSTEES REFUSE TO
CONFIRM HIS CHOICE.
Despite Their Action Joseph F. Colom
bet Will Be Placed 5 Charge of
the Office to Succeed the
Late J. N. Ewing.
BnecSal Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. 4.â Mayor Martin
and the Council, with the exception of
Councilman Wright, lo ked horns this
afternoon over tiie apnointment of a
successor to City Treasurer J. N. E\v
ing, who died suddenly last Monday.
Mayor Martin had retained a strict si
lence in regard to his choice. This
afternoon he named T -ph F. Colom
bet for the place. This was a surprise,
as the majority thought George Y. Bol
linger would be appointed.
Councilman Wright moved that the
nomination be confirmed. There was
no second. Mayor Martin then asked:
"Isn't Colombet qualified or honest
enough?"
The Mayor said it was absolutely
necessary to open the otilce next Mon
day, as 6ome $25,000 in bonds would fall
due then, besides about $11,000 interest
to be paid. Rogers suggested that Dep
uty Treasurer Cottle made Treas
urer pro tern. A recess of five minutes
was th^n taken.
On reassembling Miner moved that
the nomination of Colombet be not con
firmed. Spring, McCauley Rogers and
Miner voted aye, and Wright opposed
the motion. Miner said that a Treas
urer could be elected, and proposed
Rush McComas. Mayor Martin said
he would appoint no one but Colombet
and asked Miner:
"Did the suggestion of McComas'
name come from you yourself, or is it
at somebody's dictation?"
McCauley suggested that Elmer Cot
tie be appointed. Mayor Martin would
not heed these suggestions to appoint
a temporary Treasurer.
The opening of bids for lighting the
City Hall, fire engine houses and clock
tower demonstrated clearly that the
new gas plant of the Electric Improve
ment Company has given the city
cheaper gas. The Light and Power
Company offered to supply gas at %2
per 1000 cubic feet and electricity at 10
cents per 1000 watts. The new com
pany proposed to light the City Hall
with gas for $1 69 per 1000 cubic feet.
At present the city is paying $2 60 per
1000 feet, or nearly $1 per 1000 more than
that offered by to-day's bid. The Elec
tric Improvement Company also offered
to light all engine houses and clock
tower for $48 a month, against $66 a
month now being paid. The matter
was referred to the committee of the
whole.
It is understood Mayor Martin will
place Colombet In the treasury to-mor
row' morning without regard to the
Council's wish. In this case confirma
tion cannot come up tin next meeting.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 6, 1899.
GREEN "BEARD"
ON ARMY BEEF
But It Was All Right
Underneath.
COLONEL OSGOOD EXPLAINS
MEAT TREATED CHEMICALLY
NOT GOVERNMENT PROPERTY.
The Commissary of Subsistence Who
Served With Miles Says the Ra
tions Issued During the*
War Were Good.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"WASHINGTON, Jan. s.â Colonel
Henry B. Osgood, commissary of sub
sistence, who served with General Miles
at Tampa and at Camp Thomas and
Santiago, was before the War Investi
gation Commission to-day. General
Beaver asked many questions as to the
quality of the rations issued during the
recent war. In brief, Colonel Osgood
said the rations throughout the war
were as good, if not better, than those
usually issued to the regular army.
The beef, he said, was particularly
good and better than any he had ever
eaten at an army post. It was the first
time, he explained, that he had ever
seen the refrigerated beef issued in the
army and it was far better than tno
contract beef he had generally had at
various posts.
He said he had had under him a
butcher of twenty-two years' experi
ence who cut and issued the beef and
this man was under strict orders nevei
to issue a pound of bad beef. The Gov
ernment, he said, had a very good con
tract with Swift & Co., whereby they
kept a supply of beef on hand in re
frigerator cars and ships. Each day
witness called for what meat he wanted
and the contractors put it out on the
block. They were responsible for it till
the meat got to the troops, and if meat
was bad when delivered it went back
on the contractor. The contractor made
good whatever meat was rejected.
Colonel osgood explained that there
were many complaints as to the appeal -
ance of the meat. It had the green
mold or "beard" on the surface, as had
been explained by other witnesses. This
was repulsive looking, the witness said,
but the meat underneath was perfectly
sound and was really prime beef, much
better in fact than any beef killed on
the spot. Witness corroborated the
testimony of Major Duncan garrison
that after the men who disliked the
appearance of the refrigerated beef hau
had a short experience with meat on
the hoof they were glad to get back
to the American meat. Colonel Osgood
cited one instance where a board of
survey of the Second United States
Volunteers had condemned a lot of
beef and reported it rotten. The con
tractor protested to Colonel Osgood that
the refrigerator beef was good and
brought a steak cut from one of the
condemned quarters. The steak was
kept twenty-four hours longer off the
ice and then served to the members of
the board that had condemned it. They
did not know the antecedents of the
meat and pronounced it particularly
fine.
General Beaver said: "Colonel Os
good, it has been alleged before this
commission, not in sworn testimony,
and not in a way, perhaps, to demand
any great attention, but still it has
been stated that beef sent to Santiago
was prepared in some way with chemi
cals to preserve it. Can you tell us
anything on that head, or why any one
should use chemicals on meat when it
was apparently so easy to preserve it
in refrigerators?"
"Yes, I can tell you a good deal about
that. The meat treated in that way
was not the property of the Govern
ment or any of our contractors. I was
aboard the Comal one day and Colonel
Weston, chief commissaryt showed me
four quarters of beef hanging in the
sun which he said was 'process beef.'
It was prepared at the request of an
inventor named Powell, who claimed
that he had discovered a chemical pre
paration that would keep meat in a
hot climate without ice. It was purely
a private experiment and was not is
sued to the troops. I looked at it and
it seemed to be perfectly good. There
was no mold on it, as on the refrigera
tor beef, and It had no smell. I be
lieve Colonel Weston tasted some of it.
So far as I know he was the only offi
cer who tested it."
Witness did not say what Colonel
Weston thought of the process beef.
He continued: "I think Colonel Daly
saw this meat and probably the fact
that this beef was there gave the start
to all this talk of chemically prepared
beef. It was purely a private experi
ment and the Government had nothing
to do with it."
In connection with Colonel Osj?ood's
explanation of the "process" beef ex
periment, it can be stated that the in
ventor of the chemical preservative
brought the matter to the attention of
the War Department before the out
break of the war and offered to sell the
formula and process to the Government.
It was considered by the commanding
general, the Secretary of War and the
commissary department, and the War
Department declined.
TORMENTED BY GRIP,
HE ATTEMPTS SUICIDE
Ex-Judge J. S. Yoachiam of Watson-
ville Sends a Bullet Through
His Head.
WATSONVILLE, Jan. 5. â Ex- Judge
J. S. Yoachiam shot himself through the
head at 6:30 o'clock this morning. Though
he is still alive there is no hope of his
recovery. He had been suffering for a few
days with an attack of la grippe and
though the illness was not at all serious!
this with recent disappointments is sup
posed to have been the cause of his at
tempt at suicide.
Judge Yoachiam was well and favorably
known, being one of the pioneer business
men of Watsonville. At one time he car
ried on an extensive grocery business
under the firm name of Yoachiam & Mi
ner. For the past year he has been pre
siding Judge of Watsonville and he vacat
ed the office of Justice of the Peace only
a few days ago. He was very popular.
He leaves a widow and four children.
HURRIED OUT OF THE STATE.
Alleged Georgia Absconder Taken
Away on a Requisition.
TULARE, Jan. s.â Detective J. M. Hew
itt of Georgia went south last night with
S. Lafayette Almand, the absconder from
Conyers, Georgia. Almand was placed
under arrest here by City Marshal Car
lisle two weeks ago. Strenuous efforts
were made by Almand's friends to have
him relased on the ground of no warrant
and illegal detention. When released he
was again arrested and soon after taken
to Stockton, where he was held until the
officers obtained the proper requisition
from Governor Budd. This obtained he
was hurried south and was well on his
way to Georgia before those interested
in his release were aware of it. He is
paid to have left Georgia with at least
$27.f>PO wrongfully obtained. No effort was
spared to effect his capture.
TO BE EMBASSADOR
TO ST. PETERSBURG
Potter of Pennsylvania Is the
Man Picked Out to Represent
HON. WILLIAM POTTER.
NEW YORK, Jan. s.â The Washington correspondent of the Herald
telegraphs:
Joseph H. Choate of New York to be Embassador to Great Britain.
William Potter of Pennsylvania to be Embassador to Russia.
There seems to be no further doubt that President McKlnley will send
these nominations to the Senate within the next few days, possibly to-mor
row. Information which I obtained to-day makes it seem practically certain
that the President has selected Mr. Potter for the Russian mission. In fact
It was said Secretary Hay had received instructions to prepare the nomina
tion. However this may be 1* is known that Mr. Potter's name has been
under consideration and it is understood in official circles that he is not un
willing to accept the post.
Mr. Potter was formerly Minister to Italy, having hern stationed at Rome
during the Harrison administration. His record during that period has been
carefully examined by the I'resident and Secretary Hay and both feel confi
dent he will satisfactorily fill the St. Petersburg post.
So far as Mr. Choate is concerned some surprise was expressed to-day
that his name did not go to the Senate, but it is supposed that the Presi
dent desires to submit the nominations at the same time rather than send
one in one day and another later.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. s.â William Potter, who was United States Min
ister to Italy under President Harrison's administration, was born in Phila
delphia April 17, 1852. His father was Thomas Potter, a millionaire oilcloth
manufacturer. William Potter was matriculated in the University of Penn
sylvania ns a member of the class of '74, but owing to the illness of his
father was obliged to leave before graduation and finished his university
studies in Europe and with private tutors.
On his return to America he began the study of law, but became a
partner in his father's manufacturing corporation and continued as such
until 1892, when he was appointed by President Harrison to the Italian
mission.
As special commissioner to represent the State Department and the
Postmaster General, with instructions to visit London, Paris and Berlin, Mr.
Potter negotiated a more convenient system of sea postofflcea. This led to
his appointment as delegate to the fourth congress of the Universal Postal
Union in Vienna in 1891 with plenary powers, under which he arranged and
signed a new treaty.
DISAPPOINTS SAN
JOSE POLITICIANS
New District Attorney
Names Deputies.
SOME ILL-FEELING CREATED
GOOD GOVERNMENT LEAGUE'S
CHOICES APPOINTED.
Mr. Campbell Selects C. C. Coolidge
and A. H. Jarman, Ignoring the
Indorsement of His
Party.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, Jan. s.â The interest cen
tered in the appointment of deputies
by District Attorney Campbell was re
lieved to-day and there are many dis
appointed politicians, because C. C.
Coolidge has been given the first
deputyship and A. H. Jarman second
place.
There has been a great scramble for
the two positions, with salaries of $1800
and $1200, at the disposal of this offi
cial. Campbell was the nominee of the
Democrats, Populists and Good Gov
ernment League. The county commit
tees of all three parties indorsed dif
ferent men for the places and these in
dorsements, with the exception of that
of the Good Government League, were
ignored. The Democrats named J. W.
Sullivan and the Populists F. B. Brown.
Coolidge is a Democrat and Jarman a
Republican. Both appointments are
good ones, but the Democratic "push"
is dissatisfied because Sullivan was not
chosen. A bitter fight was made against
the latter, because of his "gang" pro
clivities.
In the election contest to-day Judges
Hyland and Kittredge overruled the
motion to throw out the Ninth Precinct
and ordered it counted. The con
testant's motion was based on the
ground that the ballots were not prop
erly returned to the County Clerk. The
election officers of the precinct were on
the stand.. It is said an appeal from
the decision will be taken to the Su
preme Court. The testimony showed
the ballots had been returned in the
ballot box because they would not go
into a pouch and were carried Into the
Courthouse cellar by a deputy of the
County Clerk. A recount of the pre
cinct developed no material change.
To-morrow 300 ballots tied up for in
spection will be passed upon and then
the gains can be determined.
Heavy Fall of Snow.
PORTLAND, Or., Jan. 5. â Snow fell
over the entire Pacific Northwest last
night and to-day. The depth varies from
six inches in the valleys to several feet
in the foothills and mountains. West of
the Cascade mountains the weather has
been below the freezing point, while east
of the Cascades, in the nlgher altitudes,

William GoodalFs Long Exposure,
Without Food or Shelter, to
the Fury of a Moun

Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, Jan. s.â After having
been out in the great New. Year's
snowstorm since Saturday night, Wil
liam Goodall appeared at the Camden
tollhouse on Tuesday evening in a
completely exhausted condition. Good
all was missing for so many hours that
he had been given up for dead. He
went out to locate some mining prop
erty and was caught in the storm. He
lost his way and wandered aimlessly
about for three days and two nights.
He was without shelter and exposed to
the fury of the storm. He had some
food with him. At the tollhouse he
was taken care of and sent to his home
in Shasta. Goodall is one of the pio
neers of the county and about 65 years
of age.
Two miners started over the Clear
Creek divide to Shasta for supplies.
"When they reached the summit, one of
them, a young man named Harkness,
gave out and was unable to proceed.
His partner left him and hurried on to
Shasta for assistance. A search party
on horseback found Harkness lying in
the snow, his dog curled up on his al
most lifeless body. The exhausted man
was taken to Shasta and conveyed to
the County Hospital, where he died
within two or three hours after his ar
rival. This is the only fatality so far
that has come to light.
Two miners came down from Delta
Tuesday evening and are waiting to
get back to their homes at Trinity Cen
ter. They crossed the mountains be
fore the storm, intending to return the
way they came. The mountain trail
over which they traveled is now buried
in five or six feet of snow, and their
friends at home have doubtless given
them up for lost. The stage line run
ning into Trinity County was unable
to connect with Weaverville for many
days, though communication has since
been re-established.

State's Highest Tribunal Is Set at

Incident Without
Action.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. s.â As the re
sult of the developments in the Stand
ard Oil case in the Supreme Court to
day, Attorney General Monett this
evening filed a petition to oust the
company from Its charter in Ohio.
COLUMBUS, Ohio, Jan. s.â ln the ar
guments before the Supreme Court to
day upon the motion of the Attorney
General to dismiss the Master Com
missioner and continue the investiga
tion of the Standard Oil Company in
open court, Virgil Kline of Cleveland,
attorney for the oil company, was
forced to make some very positive
statements and admissions. He de
clared, in the first place, in response
to interrogatories of the court that the
company would not, under the former
order of the court, produce any books
other than those already given in evi
dence. In the second pia^e hi- admitted
that there were still outstanding about
$27,000,000 worth of trust certificates of
the Standard Oil trust, which the
court ordered dissolved in 1892. but
which the president of the Standard
company has all along been trying to
get in and is still trying. The court
heard the arguments of both sides, but
took no action.
Attorney General Monnett and At
torney E. B. Kincaid appeared for the
Atttorney General's department, and
Virgil P. Kline oÂ£ Cleveland, Lawrence
T. Neal of Columbus and S. B. Elliott
of New York City for the Standard Oil i
Company. Only the Attorney General \
and .Mr. Kline addressed the court. ,
Special Master Commissioner Brins- j
maid of Cleveland, whose removal had
been demanded in the petition of the j
Attorney General, was not present,
and very little was said about him. as ',
the arguments were principally de- i
voted to the question as to whether or
not the officers of the Standard Oil
Company had complied with the recent j
order of the court to produce the cum- j
pany books, showing gross earnings â 
and distribution of dividends since the :
trust was ordered dissolved In IS9-. At
torney General Monnett argued that
the company produced no oooks in evi
dence except stock books; that dila- '
tory tactics had been resorted to; that
the Master Commissioner had not j
forced compliance with orders of the !
court; that now the funds available for,
the purpose of the investigation were
exhausted, and that the officers of the
company had defied the court.
Mr. Kline, in reply, stated that the
company had no books that were per
tinent to the order of the court save
account books and ledgers which had j
been placed in evidence. He declared j
that commercial books of the corpora
tion were formally demanded and when
pressed by the court he admitted that â 
they would not have been produced if |
asked for. He protested that such a
demand was? a violation of the rights
of the stockholders under article I of
the bill of rights, the constitution of |
the State and the fourteenth amend- J
ment.
It was at this juncture that Judge
Minshall asked:
"Do you refuse to comply with the !
order of the court?" to which Mr. Kline
replied:
"We do, for the purpose of presenting ;
the legal questions we desire to raise, j
This will be when the order is presented "
to the officials to produce them."
Subsequently Chief Justice Spear sug- I
gested that he supposed that the ob- I
ject of the company's attorneys was to !
have a witness refuse to testify regard- !
ing the books in the next hearing in the j
expectation that he would be placed I
in contempt and then habeas corpus j
proceedings would be undertaken. Mr.
Kline offered no explanation.
Chief Justice Spear asked: "Has your
company any books showing the work- '
ings of the corporation?"
Mr. Kline replied: "We have books j
showing the gross earnings and all |
financial details and we still have them, j
This talk about burning them is the ,
merest chaff."
He was next asked: "Will you pro
duce them?" and he again said: "We
will not under the former order be
cause it would be a violation of our
rights. We have always been willing
to produce our minute books and led
gers showing corporate transactions
but not books showing the holdings of
stockholders and transfers among
them. Any item that could not be
readily explained would be miscon
strued and the result would be no near
er, no clearer. We submitted all books
showing ownership of trust stock and
how it got back into the stockholders'
hands. When the order to dissolve was
made in 1892 there were $97,000,000 worth
of certificates outstanding, all of which
but about $27,000,000 have been drawn
in, but the president of the corporation
has so far been unable to get these be
cause they are held as investments and
collateral by people who prefer them
and are trying to retain them. It takes
time to convert all this amount of
money into corporate stock. The hold
ers of them do not get a dollar of div
idend from the Standard Oil Company
of Ohio. As to the books, we burn old
books in storage every ten years, but
there have been none destroyed perti
nent to this investigation."
At the conclusion of the arguments
the court gave the attorney of the oil
and constituent companies two weeks
In which to file their answers in the pe
titions against the constituent com
panies. *"- i .j?

PLOT WAS REWRITTEN.
The Author of the "Merchant Prince

Victim of a Bold
Theft.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, Jan. s.â ls "Cyrano de
Bergerac" a plagiarism? Is the play
now being produced by Richard Mans
fie'.d stolen from the "Merchant Princ<>
of Cornville," written by Samuel
Eberly Gross of Chicago?
Thete interesting questions are
square'.y raised by a suit begun to-day
in the Federal Court by Mr. Gross
agniiiPt Mr. Mansfield and his manager.
A. M. Palmer, to restrain infringement
Of a Copyright.
The papers were served on" Mansfield
this evening. The famous actor raised
a question of fact at once. While he
didn't care a continental where Ros
tand got the play, he was sure he had
never heard of the "Merchant Prince of
Cornville," or of Samuel Eberly Gross
of Chicago.
The complaint, on the other hand,
says Mansfield is the owner of a copy
of the Chicagoan's play, and among:
other things sets forth: The "Merchant
Prince of Cornville," written by Sam
uel Eberly Gross, a resident of Chicago,
as a diversion from business pursuits,
betwe ' 1875 and 1579, and submitted in
the manuscript to A. M. Palmer in the
latter year, and at the same time to A.
R. Cazauran, a Frenchman, and Pal
mer's dramatic reader. In 1883. still in
manuscript, it was at Mr. Cazauran's
request again delivered to him. He was
employed by A. M. Palmer as dramatic
reader, adapter and adviser and had
previously given a favorable judgment
on the play. He retained the manu
script several months. Letters and tele
grams from Cazauran state that â  he
submitted the play to several theatrical
managers and nroprietors. Thus from
the time of completitnon until 1895 the
manuscript was sont at various time 3
to different actors and managers for
inspection. It was not produced, how
ever, and in 1595 and 1896. A statu
printed by Stone & Kimball. A statu
tory playright in England was secured
November 11, 1896, and the play was
also copyrighted November 12. 1896. in
England and the United States. Since
1896, a copy of the play has been dis
tributed by the author. Many promi
nent actors, managers and play writers
in England and America received and
retained copies, among them Richard
Mansfield.
Mr. Gross declined to talk of the suit
this evening, but his private secretary,
Albert J. Fisher, made the following
statement:
"At the first reading of the dramatic
criticism of Cyrano de Bergerac' Mr.
Gross was struck with the description
of the balcony scene, which seemed to
fit his play exactly. He felt at once
that making love by poetry, under the
circumstances described, was his inven
tion. A day or two later he received
a letter from a prominent actor and
member of the Players' Club of New
York, who had seen the play, saying
Gross had certainly anticipated some
of the most effective scenes in 'Cyrano
de Bergerac.' Gross began a careful
comparison of the plays, using the
Kingsbury translation, authorized by
Mansfield. The likeness of the two
plays grew upon him and was height
ened by seeing the production of 'Cy
rano de Bergerac.' Gross thought he
recognized all the most salient features
of most of his characters in some
or -..lion of the Mansfield production.
The scene upon which all the dramatic
action hangs, ud to the final denoue
ment, is the proxy lovemaking found
in the balcony scene, which in all its
principal features seems to be an ac
tual reproduction of that in ihe play of
Mr. Gross, in so far as dramatic action
and ideas are concerned, extending to
some extent to the language itself in
which those ideas are expressed.
"Mr. Gross believes he has absolute
fact for foundation or he never would
have gone into court to discredit the
production of Mansfield or of the play
which he produces, but feels he has a
right, as an English writer once put it,
to 'claim his own wherever he
finds it.'"

at Paris' '.;i the Itftb inst., and as the re
pÂ»lt of vl American arms, the
.futu:- disposition and govern
ment of the Philippine Islands are ceded
to ti. B. In fulfillment of
the rights of thus acquired
m<l the responsible obligations of govern
ment thus assumed, the a< tual occupation
and administration of the entire group of
the Philippine Islands becomes immedi
ately necessary and the military govern
ment heretofore maintained by the United
States in the city harbor and bay of Ma
nila is to be extended with all possible
aispatch to the whole of the ceded terri
tory.
"In performing this duty the military
sommander of the United States is en
loined to make known to the inhabi
:ants of the Philippine Islands that, in
lucceedlng to the sovereignty of Spain,
n severing the former political relations
jf the inhabitants and in establishing
lew political power, the authority of the
United States is to be exerted for the
Hecurtiy of the persons and property of
the people of the islands and for the con
firmation of all their private rights and
relations. It will be the duty of the com
mander of the forces of occupation to an
nounce and proclaim in the most public
manner that we come, not as invaders or
conquerors, but as friends, to protect the
natives in their homes, in their employ
ments and in their personal and religious
rights. All persons, who, either by active
aid or honest submission co-operate with
the Government of the United States to
give effect to these benefits and purposes,
will receive the reward of its support and
protection. All others will be brought
within the lawful rule we have assumed,
with firmness if need be, but without se
verity, as far as may be possible.
"V\ ithin the absolute domain of mili
tary authority, which necessarily is and
must remain supreme in the ceded ter
ritory until the legislation of the United
States shall otherwise provide, the mu
n'cipal laws of the territory, in respect
to private rights and property and the
repression of crime are to be considered
as continuing in force and to be admin
istered by the ordinary tribunals, as far
as possible. The operations of civil and
municipal government are to be per
formed by such officers as may accept
the supremacy of the United States by
taking the oath of allegiance, or by offi
cers chosen so far as may be practica
ble from the inhabitants of the island.
"While the control of all the public
property and the revenues of the State
passes with the cession, and while the
use and the management of all public
means of transportation are necessarily
reserved to the authority of the United
States, private property, which belongs
to individuals or corporations, is to be
respected, except for cause fully estab
lished. The taxes and duties heretofore
payable by the inhabitants to the late
Government become payable to the au
thorities of the United States, unless it
be seen fit to substitute for them other
reasonable rates or modes of contribu

whether general or local. If private
property be taken for military use it
shall be paid for when possible in cash a
a fair valuation, and when payment in
cash is not practicable receipt's are to
be given.
"All ports and places in the Philippine

land and naval forces of the United States
will be opened to the commerce of al
friendly nations. All goods and wares no
prohibited for military reasons by due an
nouncement of the military authority will
be admitted upon payment of such duties
and other charges as shall be in force at
the time of their importation.
"Finally, it shall be the earnest and
paramount aim of the military adminis

affection of the inhabitants of the Philip

way that full measure of individual rights
and liberty which are the heritage of a free

FILIPINOS THREATEN
AN OPEN RUPTURE
HONGKONG, Jan. s.â Leading repre
sentatives of the Filipino Junta in
Hongkong, in the course of an inter
view with the correspondent of the As
sociated Press, to-day declared that the
serious crisis in the Philippines is due
to what they designate as "overt, un
fair" treatment of the Filipinos by the
United States. They said that despite
the known fact that the whole of the
Visayas group was in possession of the
Filipino forces, General Otis was or
dered to take possession of the entire
archipelago and dispatched troops and
warships to the southern Visayas. The
Filipinos, according to the junta repre
sentatives, are determined to prevent
the landing of the Americans at lloilo
and may, as a last resort, destroy the
city for strategical purposes.
The junta insists that a rupture of
the friendly relations now existing be
tween the "Filipino national govern
ment" and the American executive is
imminent, and that hostilities are prob
able, unless what they characterize as
the "unreasonable, unfair and over
bearing policy of the Americans" is
modified. They say the Filipinos "would
deeply regret such a rupture, but would
accept it as inevitable."
In concluding the interview the
spokesman of the junta representa
tives said: "The Filipinos appeal to
the American people to uphold the
rights of mankind and to avoid blood
shed, assuring the Americans of our
desire to complete a friendly settlement
through an impartial committee of in
quiry. The Filipinos loyally supported
the Amercans against the common
enemy, and they now look to the
American nation to fulfill the promises
made to Aguinaldo at Singapore before
he proceeded to assist Admiral Dewey.
All the Filipinos ask is the truest and
best rights of mankind."

and Singapore, relative to the PhiliD

Consul Wildman, at Hongkong, on

-Pr^tt rpnlied that he had no Inten-
H^f^f npSltlatlne ' Says he "f eft

that to Dewey, who desires Aguinaldo
to come."
Secretary Day again admonished
Pratt to be cautious to create no im-
pression that might embarrass the Gov
ernment and lead to misunderstanding
on its future action.
July. 2 Pratt reports to the depart-
ment that the Sultan of the Sulu Is- I
lands was negotiating at Singapore for ]
the annexation of his group tr> British ;
Borneo, which he said should be
watched.
All of the statements made by Gen
eral Merrltt before the American Com
mission at Paris appear in the docu
ment. In substance he said the insurg
ents would fight if the attempt was
made to surrender Luzon to Spain.
Spain could not preserve the islands un
aided. Asked whether the insurgents
were capable of government, he replied
that it would take time; they would
have to be educated up to it. Senator
Frye asked if the natives would enlist
under the American flag and if Agui
naldo could be given a command. He
replied in the affirmative to both ques
tions. Further, he said that Major
Bell's report showed that the insurgents
had 39,500 stands of arms. Aguinaldo
had $300,000 in bank in Hongkong and
$220,000 in public funds in Bacoor. Ma
jor Bell expressed the opinion that if
the United States should govern the
islands for a year Aguinaldo would
have no army left.
General Greene's estimate is also pro
duced. He said there were 13,000 Span
ish prisoners in the Philippines, includ
ing 400 officers, with 22,000 arms and
22,000,000 rounds of ammunition. He
described Aguinaldo's character and
said much tact would be required in
dealing with him. In his opinion that
chieftain did not command the sup
port of a large body of Filipinos.
Then it must be remembered that the
insurgents were all Tagallos, only one
of thirty races in the Philippines. At
the time he spoke none of the two
million Visayas, a people of equal abili
ties, had taken any part. He was asked
what chance there would be for native
government, to which he replied: "No
native government can maintain itself
without the active support of a strong
foreign government. It is difficult to
see how any foreign government can
give this protection without taking such
an active part in the management of
| affairs as is practically equivalent to
I its own name."
There is a vast amount of other mat
ter included in the papers, extracts
from newspapers, long special report
on the mineral and other resources oi
the islands, historical treaties, statisti
cal statements of the values of imports
and exports and in fact they comprise
an encyclopedia of the Philippines.
GENERAL MILLER TOLD
TO OCCUPY ILOILO
NEW YORK, Jan. 5.â A special to the
World from Washington says: "Gen
eral Miller has received instructions to
land his expedition and occupy Iloilo."
This statement was made to the
World correspondent to-night on high
authority and was confirmed by two
Cabinet officers. It was not the inten
tion of the President to begin the cx
i tension of military jurisdiction in the
Philippines until after the arrival of
the six regiments of regulars, prepara
tions for the sending of which are now
I being made, but the insurgents forced
; the issue by occupying Ilcrilo. Secretary
Alger to-night, in answer to a question
as to whether or not instructions had
| been sent to General Miller to effect a
i landing, said: "The rebels can fight or
1 run."
KILLING OF NATIVES A
FEATURE OF EXPANSION
PRINCETON, N. J., Jan. 5. â Ex-
President Cleveland, in reply to the re
quest of a representative of the Asso
ciated Press for an expression on the
question of expansion, said:
I do not care to repeat my views con
cerning the prevailing epidemic of impe
rialism and territorial expansion. As
suming, however, that my ideas on the
subject are antiquated and unsuited to
these progressive days it is a matter of
surprise to see that the refusal of ceraln
natives of our new possessions to acqui
esce in the beneficence of subjecting them
selves to our control and management
should in the least disturb our expansion
ists. This phase of the situation ought
not to have been unanticipated, nor the
incident naturally growing out of it over
looked. The remedy is obvious and sim
ple. The misguided inhabitants of our
new territory who prefer something dif
ferent from the plan for their control
which we proposed or oppose our designs
In their behalf should be slaughtered. The
killing of natives has been a. feature of
expansion since expansion began, and our
imperialistic enthusiasm should hot be
checked by the prospective necessity of
destroying a few hundred thousand Fili
pinos. This should only be regarded as
one stage in a transcendentally great
movement, a mere incident in its progress.
Of course, some unprepared souls would
then be lost before we had the opportu
nity of christianizing them, but surely
those of our clergymen who have done so
much to encourage expansion could man
age that difficulty.

Senator Perkins Makes a Hit in His
Speech at Boston in Opposition
to Expansion.
WASHINGTON.. Jan. s.â Senator Per
kins returned to-day from Boston, where
he addressed the Boston Merchants'
Association Tuesday night in opposition
to the permanent retention of the Philip
pines. He speaks enthusiastically of his
reception. His speech was well received
and made a great hit. Congressman Bou

Accused of Having Passed
Counterfeit Money.
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. s.â Fred W. Sha

(\ DELECTABLE GOVERNOR.
WE unhesitatingly .hazard the assertion that the
history of California furnishes no parallel for
the condition which exists at the present time
in the executive chamber of the State Capitol. In
.more senses than one that condition may be said to
be entirely devoid of theory of any kind.
; Not only has Governor Gage allied himself with
the Senatorial ambition of a degraded political boss,
Whose reputation smells to high heaven, but he is
aly doing the dirty work of all that individual's
friends. Every ounce of the political strength with
â¢which the law invests him is being utilized to pro
imitc the prospects of Dan Burns. All the power of
. ithe legislative arm of the government was
exerted to force the gubernatorial inauguration two
!â¢!â  three days ahead of time in order that Burns'
. gambling partner should not be dispossessed of his
office 01 Police Commissioner in this city.
It ought to be unnecessary to explain to intelligent
people hi w this has been done. The patronage of the
State, the executive veto and the favor of the boss
have been exerted to produce a hurried installation of
the Governor. Nor need we surmise what it all
.means. It means that Burns is boss and that Gage
desires the world to know that he is his creature.
.'pur history will be searched in vain for a similar
[evidence of gubernatorial subjugation. Mr. Gage has
s'roclaimed all along that he was independent and
aid himself be Governor. His course proves that
:t.]ns was mere talk. He has so far been the tool and
..creature of Dan Burns. He has said plainly that he
will assist that unsavory individual to become Senator,
;nnd if he succeeds in conferring the toga upon him
doubt he will enjoy the fruits of the "victory."
There is. however, one element with which Mr.
Gage in his groveling subjection to Burns has not
reckoned. The people are regarding him with curious
eyes. Their judgment is already partly made up. If
he shall continue to be what his course so far fore
shadows â the abject tool of the corrupt and debased
buss â a high pinnacle of infamy awaits him in the
history of California. Playing such a role he will go
down to posterity as the first Governor whose soul
was bartered for the office â the first who earned the
title of lackey, tool, falsifier and rogue.
. THE STfITE MILITIA SERVICE.
' IZJ NCOURAGED by the results attained by the
National Harbor Defense Convention held at
â J . Tampa in 1896, Governor Bloxham of Florida
lias issued an invitation requesting the Governors of
the various States to appoint delegates to another
convention to assemble at Tampa February 8 to dis
cuss ways and means for a thorough reorganization
af the State militia service.
A circular letter accompanying the invitation states
that the object of the convention will be to discuss
,-tnd suggest methods for placing State troops on the
most effective footing. Questions relating to arms,
equipment, tactics, clothing, food and transportation
are to be discussed by experts, and it is announced
that special attention will be given to the subject of
camp sites, sanitation and all precautionary measures
modern science can suggest to insure the comfort and
health of troops.
There can be no question as to the desirability of
a careful and thorough consideration of these sub-
. jeets. The outbreak of the recent war with Spain dis
closed the fact that only three or four States had a
National Guard sufficiently drilled and equipped to
constitute an effective force. It is gratifying to know
that California was one of the few whose troops were
ready for action when the call came, and yet even in
this State much may be done in the way of improving
the service.
The best that can be expected of the proposed con
vention is the adoption of some plan that will unite
fhe National Guard of all the States into something
like a consistent military force. Undoubtedly pro
posals to that end will be made, and possibly Con
gress will be asked to lend its aid to carry out what
ever plan is adopted. It would be well, therefore, to
have California represented at the convention in
order that the lessons learned by the experience of
our National Guard may be duly considered by the
delegates from the other States in making up their
conclusion as to what is best to be done in the pro
posed reorganization.
Fault has been found with the "assumption" by
Americans that Cubans are an inferior people. In
fact, there is no assumption about it, but the Cubans
may improve with time and specific instructions.
There seems to be a prospect that some of the vol
unteers in Manila will get that homesick feeling
knocked out of them by a sterner duty than policing
camp and fighting the Philippine mosquito.
Burns says that he will not spend money to buy
votes. T"o people acquainted with Dan this declara
tion is evidence enough that he will.
While the Cubans are shouting for independence
they are actively demonstrating their unfitness for it.
FINANCIAL REFORM.
CONFLICTING statements come from Wash
ington concerning the sentiment of party lead
ers as to a currency session of Congress.
One statement is that the politicians regard the
financial issue as no linger necessary to Republican
success. They feel xhat the party has been so
strengthened by the Spanish war and the questions
which issue from it that it can rely on these for suc
cess far into the future, as it was helped through five
I 'residential campaigns by the issues made in the
Civil War. This being true, they say that to take
up financial reform now with a view to making simple
cur complex legislation and straightening that which
is crooked would in effect be making a new issue
that may displace those so highly prized as coming
from the war.
Of course, this is simply the politicians' view of it.
That class of necessity treat issues as the means of
carrying elections and redeem promises or not as it
may affect future campaigns. They are opportunists
who weigh the votes to be won by keeping faith
against those to be had by breaking it, and parties in
their hands and leadership lack that continuity of
policy through which principles are established and
the public good becomes permanent.
It is with some modesty that we suggest that the
war issues had less to do with Republican success in
the war year than these politicians think. In New
York the nomination of Colonel Roosevelt brought
the thrill and enthusiasm of the war into the cam
paign. He had been a picturesque figure in battle,
had shown the personal courage of a Paladin, the
gallantry of a Templar. Yet his majority but little
exceeded 17,000, and his party lost heavily in the
House and barely gained the power to get Murphy's
seat in the Senate.
As the political battle field stretched westward the
issue changed and the party majority increased. When
it reached the Pacific Coast this was very marked.
In California the Fusionist and Republican platforms
both indorsed the war and favored colonial expansion,
so there was no issue here on those points. The
division between the parties was on the financial pol
icy of the Government. The Republican position
attracted the alliance of the sound money Democrats
as in 1896, and they by an official proclamation of
their State committee entered the campaign in sup
port of Republican candidates for Congress and for
the Legislature, as well as for the State ticket.
In 1896 California cast 296.503 votes for six candi
dates for the Presidency, of which McKinley received
146,170, leaving him in a minority of 3163, though his
plurality over Bryan was 2837.
It is clear, then, that to whatever issues moved the
minds of voters here we owe the transfer of this Re
publican minority of 3163 into a majority of nearly
20.000. The vote cast for Palmer for President in
1896 in 1898 joined the body of sound money Demo
cratic votes and went for the Republican ticket. Also
thousands of sound money Democrats who supported
Bryan on the ground of party regularity recognized
that bond no longer and joined their brethren who
rejected it in 1896. These causes, rooted in the finan
cial issue alone, transformed a Republican minority
into a Republican majority in California.
What happened here occurred in Nebraska, in Ore
gon and in the Middle West.
We are convinced that politicians make a mistake
when they advise the desertion of the financial issue
entirely, or defer fulfillment of the party pledge to
1004. The only course for a great party is to keep its
promise as soon as the people give it the power. The
Republican minority in the present Senate made the
party powerless to redeem its sound money pledge of
1896. The people, aware of this, have removed the
barrier. They have made possible a good working
Republican majority in the Senate and have saved
the party by a narrow margin in the House. They ex
pect pledges to be redeemed. If they are disappointed
the labors of 1896 were as nothing to those required
in 1900 to win the Presidency.
The country is not to be diverted from this issue.
The people will not consider pledges or new issues
in discharge of accrued obligations. If the Republi
can party confess its inability to settle the financial
issue, to pass laws to bring that question to the angle
of repose, it will disappoint the strong conservative
sentiment of the country and will suffer for it.
TELEPHONE LEGISLATION.
THE abuses of telephone administration in this
city, in both the local and Sunset offices, have
been set forth in detail. Instead of guarding
the privacy and protecting the ownership of messages
by telephone, there is no privacy and no ownership.
Newspapers may pay heavily for service over the
Sunset to secure exclusive news, but it is plugged on
to the wire of a rival paper that pays nothing for it,
except perhaps "fair treatment" of the telephone cor
poration and the cost of occasional suppers for the
unfaithful operators whom it seduces from their duty.
If the law is faulty and lacks provisions for protect
ing telephone patrons, it should be extended to cover
their case.
The Sunset should be forbidden by law to keep a
verbatim record of conversations between its patrons.
It has no right to make such record, none to file it
away. It is paid for use of its wires and phones by
the time used, not by the number of words trans
mitted. Therefore this record of conversations is not
for its benefit, does it no good, is not necessary in
checking its operators or keeping its accounts. The
existence of such a record serves no good purpose
for customer or corporation. Its only possible use
must be for sinister and improper purposes. The
telephone is not established to put its owners or
operators in possession of the personal and domestic
privacies and the political, amatory or business secrets
and confidences of its patrons. It is simply to serve
those who pay for it. One message wears out wires,
exhausts batteries or lowers tension no more than
any other message. Conversations by telephone con
cern only those who hold them. No other party has
a right to hear, and any decent person would not do
so even by accident or induction.
Xo excuse can be given nor apology for these
telephone abuses, and the fact of their existence calls
for remedy. Let it be forbidden to make a record of
conversations between the patrons of a telephone by
the corporation, and let it be made a felony to plug a
wire on to another wire to transmit conversation to
an eavesdroper. Let the penalty attach to % the com
pany, to the operator and to the receiver.
It will be complained by the telephone corporation
that such legislation will be a cinch. But this is not
so. It proposes no interference with rates, and does
nothing only gives the users of the telephone what
they pay for â security and privacy in using its wires.
Perhaps the gentlemen who decline to state whether
or not they will vote for Burns for Senator are merely
waiting to ascertain whether the gentleman is worthy.
The raiment of spotless purity in which the friends
of Dan Burns are clothing him fits fully as well as a
toga would.
The presence of Mose Gunst at the capital did not
create a furor. It merely created a stench.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 6 V 1899.
BACKED BY THE EXAMINER.
THOSE who can read between and under the
lines can easily perceive that the Examiner is
deliberately aiding the candidacy of Dan Burns
or the man behind him. In the political campaigns of
1896 and 1898 that paper was most unmercifully
flogged by the voters of the State. Its eccentrical
editorials, its black lines, its magnified letters, with
I all its flaring headings and its artistic and unartistic
; illustrations and cartoons, accomplished nothing. It
was beaten out of sight and the fact demonstrated
that, whatever its circulation among those elements of
I population that feed on sensations, it was destitute of
I real influence. Scandalous personalities and carica
j tores may amuse thoughtless or vicious people, but
they only disgust the body of citizens who determine
the result of elections.
With inordinate and ridiculous pretensions, paraded
with the cheap gaudiness of a pawnbroker's window,
the Examiner represents nothing but itself. Its
treacheries to the Democracy have been so numerous
that it has long been repudiated by the best men in
that party. For them, for the Republicans or for the
mass of solid and reputable citizens, without distinc
tion of party, it has furnished only the hide-bound
emptiness of a drum. It has scolded, bullied, insulted
and ridiculed without stint the men who have built
up the State. It has puffed professional charlatans
with the success of an emetic. It has brayed like a
Pharisaical ass and kicked like a government mule,
and has dreamt that its noise was the voice of a
leader and its senseless contortions exhibitions of
suppleness and strength.
There *is only a step from the sublime to the
ridiculous. This exponent of a "national policy" dur
ing the campaign of 1898 lived on a false charge that
the railroad controlled the Republican party. It beat
tom-toms until the whistles of declining day were al
most silenced. It filled the air at night with the
sulphurous flames of cheap fireworks. Amidst uni
versal laughter and derision it shrieked till its throat
became dry and cracked, and swallowed wind till it
resembled an inflated but collapsing balloon.
When the election was over it was hoped and al
most believed that it was dead, and, from pure sym
pathy, there was an inclination to give it at least the
tribute of a Chinese funeral. But from some hidden
source it was resuscitated into a feeble life, and now
it is officiating as the trained nurse of Dan Burns.
What are the wages of its ministrations in this pe
culiar case of political leprosy may be conjectured,
but cannot be distinctly proved. All that can be seen
is that it is bandaging his sores, rubbing his back and
administering black draughts, irregularly prescribed
by an unseen physician. The impression that this
treatment produces upon the legislative spectators in
due time will be determined. If it leads to Republican
obsequies in 1900 then, for once at least, this grinning
specter from the tomb of November will prove the
truth of resurrection and emerge from the cesspool of
disgrace with the laurel wreath upon its battered head.
SMOOTH PAVEMENTS.
I""*HE last persons from whom the public antici
pated opposition to bituminous rock pavements
were the firemen. Up to date the belief has been
general that of all men in the city who are interested
in having smooth streets, the members of the Fire
Department were foremost. It has been thought that
if the city was entirely paved with asphalt several
thousands of dollars a year would be saved in fire ap
paratus now rattled to pieces over basalt blocks.
But it appears that all this has been a mistake.
Bituminous rock is too smooth for the firemen, and
they are now asking the Board of Supervisors not
only to lay a strip of basalt through the center of all
blocks hereafter paved with that material, but to tear
up those already laid and remodel them. This, the
firemen say, is necessary to enable them to get to
fires. The weather sometimes makes smoothly paved
blocks impassable for the engines. The horses slip
and fall and the machines go in all directions.
We remember that when Mayor Phelan began
agitating for the repavement of Market street a great
deal of public sentiment was created in his favor by
the refusal of the Cable Railroad Company to pave
vvith bitumen between its tracks. An interesting
point of law was raised in connection with the sub-
ject. Mayor Phelan claimed that the company was
obliged to repave whenever ordered by the Super
visors. The company claimed that once having put
the street in order it could not be compelled to re
pave until the material had worn out.
The upshot of the matter was that Mayor Phelan
proceeded with Market street and left the cable com
pany to its basalt blocks. Now it appears that this
was exactly what the firemen desired. Market street
has through the center a strip of basalt over which the
fire-horses can travel without losing their feet. If
Mayor Phelan had succeeded in making the cable
company repave the firemen would now be demand
ing the replacement of the basalt blocks.
Exactly how this controversy is going to terminate
can scarcely be foretold. But if the Fire Department
desire a strip of basalt laid in any bituminized block
probably they will eventually get it. The people can
not afford to have fire-horses scrambling upon the
pavements when their property is being destroyed by
fire. But it is a curious state of affairs when all our
literature concerning smooth pavements is to be up
set in this manner. The event shows that human judg
ment in some affairs is far from infallible.
A judicial decision declares that the Western Union
need not pay a revenue tax, but many judicial deci
sions have set forth that the Wells-Fargo Express
Company must pay such. Nevertheless, one corpor
ation is paying as fast and as willingly as the other,
which means that neither is letting go a cent. It
seems almost queer.
Touts of Burns are surprising their faces with con
tributions of such viands as do not appear on the bill
of fare at their customary Barbary Coast restaurants.
It seems to be the Burns idea that a country member
full and dyspeptic is peculiarly subject to the blandish
ments of patriotism.
The Examiner is in much distress at the prospect
that Democratic legislators may have the wisdom to
.'lid the Republicans in electing a good man for Sen
ator. The Examiner always shies at any evidence of
respectability.
A watchman was arrested the other night for watch
ing the property he was hired to protect. What did
the police expect him to do, anyhow? There are
watchmen who watch.
Ex-Governor Budd may be ill, but it is easy to
imagine him singing that good old song in which is
the refrain, "And the Burden of My Heart Rolled
Away."
There will be no occasion to pay excess baggage
on the Knight boom when the proprietor starts for
home.
If there is any object in ascertaining who blew up
the Maine Chief Lees can be addressed at the City
Hall.
RANCH AND RURAL LIFE.
There is a deficit of 350,000 tons in the German beet sugar crop for last
year and old stocks of sugar in Europe are low. The beet sugar busi
ness of California should be good this year.
The Fresno Game Protection Society has sent for another lot of Mon
golian pheasants, to turn loose in the Kings River bottoms. These are very
fine game birds, and by legal protection against hunters in Oregon have in
creased until they are very numerous. The cock is a beautiful bird, with
splendid plumage. They are the finest flavored fowls known, excelling on
the table our grouse, quail or prairie chicken. California is well adapted
to them and they should be tried in different parts of the State. The
Fresno Society has also sent to lowa for prairie chickens and the bob
white quail. The State fosters the introduction of new varieties of food
fish, and in that way we have acquired the shad and striped bass. There
is no reason why as much attention should not be paid to stocking the
State with game birds.
The general rain of New Year's day broke the long drought and put a
brighter face on things in the rural districts. It did not itself assure a crop,
but proved that raining is not a lost art in California. The great snow
fall in the mountains was more significant than the rainfall in the valleys.
It means plenty of water for irrigation and mining. It will nil up the
mountain reservoirs which have bet.-n heavily drawn upon. On the whole
the outlook is excellent for a great year.
The rural interests of this State should make themselves felt before the
present Legislature in securing a law to prevent forest fires, and detect
and punish those who are responsible for them. The glory of our moun
tains is passing away in the destruction of the forests on their Hanks, and
if the process is not stopped the beauty of the State will be tarnished and
its prosperity checked. This matter should be taken up in every Farmers'
Institute that is held this winter and should be kept before the Legisla
ture until it is acted upon. This matter is quite as important as any that
can occupy the attention of the Legislature.
The railroads of Florida have a system of signals by which they warn
the people of approaching changes in the weather. The frost signal used
in the citrus region is six long blasts on the engine whistle, thirty seconds
to each blast, repeated every three miles. Our California roads could do
something in the same line with credit to themselves and profit to ranchers.
A frost signal when trees and vines are in bloom and a rain signal when
fruit is drying on the trays would help our very efficient signal service,
which is limited in the number of its stations.
STATE NOTES.
The County Infirmary of Butte County has ample grounds which were
long unutilized. They were finally set out in orange trees. In 1896 the first
crop sold for $41 50. In 1897 it brought $171 and in IS9S SSSO. The trees that
bore these crops were first put out for ornament and shade, but when they
began to bear several acres were added to the orchard and the crop, when
the trees are in full bearing, will bring several thousand dollars, and the
Oroville Mercury says will pay all the cost of the County Infirmary. Her*
is a hint for other counties in our Icng and wide orange belt.
The orange growers of Oroville took in $150,000 for their crop.
At the Florin Farmers' Institute, Senator Doty said the greatest trouble
with the fruit growers is in packing fruit so as to deceive the purchaser.
Commercial honesty pays. In the same meeting irrigation by pumping was
discussed and Mr. Rutter said that in the drought of 1864 he borrowed $800
at 2 per cent a month to put in a pumping plant to irrigate his peach orch
ard, and his fruit was so fine that he paid the debt and made $800 profit.
The Sotoyome Sun strongly advises that Sonoma County fruit be identi
fied with Sonoma County by proper labeling of the green, dry and canned
product. It also intimates that the best Sonoma prunes are sold as Santa
Clara fruit. If this be so it proves the value of a reputation. The prune
growers of Santa Clara Valley from the first identified their fruit with th<nr
county and have kept up its reputation by commercial honor.
The Spreckels beet sugar factory at Salinas is completed at a cost of
$2,500,000. During its running season it will consume every day $12,000
worth of beets and pay .SSOOO in wages, making a distribution of $17,000 daily.
To run it will require the beets from 30,000 acres, and there are 90,000 acres
of beet land in Salinas Valley.
The fruit cannery at Hanford was started last year. The drought
shortened the fruit crop, but the pack was 42,000 cases, and $27,635 was
paid out for fruit and $1H,485 as wages. As many as 558 people were em
ployed and the run was fifty-s.c days. The women employed averaged $1 25
and the men $2 50 per day. It is expected that this new cannery will handle
2500 tons and have a run of one hundred days this year.
In the last week of December Riverside shipped forty-two carloads of
oranges. The total shipment from that point of the present crop is 130,537
boxes, or 388 carloads.
The total orange shipment of Butte County is 275 carloads.
The citrus fruit shipment from Ontario for the season 1897-98 was 844
carload? oranges and 239 of lemons, making it the third citrus shipping point
in the State.
Necessity is the mother of invention. Mr. Clark, a Fairview rancher,
beinp out of hay gathered several tons of dry tumbleweeds and offered them
to his cattle. The stock not only ate them but fattened on them.
SPAIN'S TREATMENT OF WEAKER POWERS.
The communication published below
was written recently by Frederic Hail.
who died a few days ago. Mr. Hall
was formerly the legal adviser of Max
imilian in Mexico.
' The work of the Peace Commissioners
at Paris has been concluded, though not
without numerous protests ami bitter feel
ings on the part of Spain. It will not j
be uninteresting to review briefly the j
character, the demands and the bearing j
of Spain in general, and particularly :
her transactions with powers of lesser
physical ability.
She has not foreotten, and never wijl,
her former glory, her grandeur, her
wealth, and her vast domains. Her splen
dor, regal pomp, power and iuliuence, cre
ated and fostered in her boundless priile,
haughtiness and dictatorial bearing. Her
courts, arrayed in glittering splendor,
were looked upon, as she imagined, with
great wonder by other powers. The Span
ish grandees who could wear their hats
in the presence of the King were consid
ered far superior to any English or re
publican gentleman. No soldier of Eu
rope over related with more pride his dar
ing deeds than did the Spanish knight his
tale of Spanish bravery.
The gorgeous splendors of other Euro
pean courts wore fancied by Spain to be
in borrowed light, reflected from the sun
of her own glory. She has looked down
with contempt upon every power she be
lieved to be her inferior, and when ques
tions have arisen between them and her
self she assumed an overbearing attitude
that was disagreeable and even sufficient
to destroy all hope of an amicable settle
ment.
Even at the commencement of this late
conflict she could not refrain from ridi
cule. Sho pictured the Americans as
"hogs," which, she seemed to think, she
could easily gather in droves, and with
the aid of such men as Wcyler butcher
them. Her plans she was unable to carry
out, and the "hogs," as she pictured them
to be, came near eating her up. She has,
at last, taken down her pictures and we
have taken in her provinces. In a finan
cial view the taking was to our advan
tage.
If Spain ever refrained from insolence
when she believed she could overawe her
antagonist history has not rcorded the
event. For three-quarters of a century
Cuba has been a threatening' isle and a
menace to American shipping and pride.
The shooting of Americans taken from the
Virginius, some years ago, without a
trial, is still fresh in the minds of many
Americana. Californians in particular do
not view the Spanish in any pleasant
light. They remember that when they
neared the Cuban coast, before our con
tinental railroad was built, not infre
quently a shot from a Spanish gun came
across the steamer's bow, which brought
her to. They had some complaint against
the steamer which always turned out to
be groundless. American ladies and gen
tlemen were insulted on board the steam
er by Spanish brutes, and no remedy ex
isted therefor.
They believed then that the United
States were their inferiors on the sea,
and perhaps not without some reason, as
our navy was formerly composed of
ships, in some ways, unequal to the Span
ish fleet. It has been said our Govern
ment was unwilling to test the relative
prowess of the two navies.
To illustrate Spain's treatment of
lesser powers we have but to recall her
acts In South America. During the presi
dency of General Jose Antonio Pezet, on
the 14th day of April, 1864, a Spanish
squadron, under pretext of obtaining sat
isfaction for damages claimed by some
Spanish subjects, took possession of tne
islands of Chincha, valuable property of
Peru. Admiral Pinzon, commander of the
squadron, declared in a public document
that, since 1824, there had only existed a
truce or armistice, or a suspension of
hostilities, between Spain and Peru, and
that the mere taking possession of those
islands was a vindication of Spanish
rights, as Spain was still the owner of
them. President Pezet, in spite of the
protestations of his people, made a treaty
of peace on the 27th day of January, 18tJ5,
by which Peru recognized the demands of
Spain, and promised to pay an indemnity
of $3,000,000. Then the Spanish squadron
evacuated the islands and paid its atten
tion to Chile, because the latter had ex
hibited sympathy for Peru. The Span
ish admiral was not satisfied with the ex
planations of Chile, and in consequence
thereof declared war against her and
blockaded her ports. The people of Peru
were so humiliated by the treaty of Pres
ident Pezet that a revolution broke out
and he was compelled to leave the coun
try in an English ship.
The claim of Spain to the Chincha
Islands on the ground that the peace of
1824 was a mere armistice â a mere sus
pension of hostilitiesâ was the most un
scrupulous and outrageous act that ever I
was performed by one nation against j
another. The public declaration of the j
Spanish admiral as to the ownership of
the Chincha Islands was an ostentatious
di name of justice and international law.
If the peace of 1824 was but a suspension
of hostilities it became the longest armis
tice ever known in history. Over forty
years had elapsed since the armistice was
promulgated. Let us look into the facts
pertaining to the struggle of 1524. The
great battle of 1824 between Spain and
Peru took place on the 9th of December
and it decided the fate of the latter. It
took place at Ayacucha. It was fought
with desperation on both sides. It ended
with the capture of the Spanish Viceroy
and all of his officers. If such a termin
ation of a battle can be termed merely a
suspension of hostilities it is a perver
sion of language that no nation except
Spain would have the audacity to ad
vance.
On the 23d of January, 1866, the repre
sentatives of Chile, Peru, Bolivia and
Ecuador formed in Lima a treaty of al
liance by which they united for common
defense, promising to maintain no rela
tion with any nation that should attack
either of them. On the 14th of April, 1866,
the Spanish squadron bombarded the de
fenseless port of Valparaiso. This act of
Spain was viewed with abhorrence by
every other civilized nation. Over two
thousand shot and shell were thrown into
the city and not a shot was returned.
Over ten millions of property was de
stroyed, belonging principally to foreign
residents. A very considerable amount of
public property as well as private suc
cumbed to the cannon. Every foreign
Minister and Consul protested in the
name of humanity, law and justice, but
all to no purpose. The unscrupulous and
vainglorious ambition of the Spaniards
could not be 'checked.
Peru refused to carry out the provi
sions of the Pezet treaty. The Spanish
squadron bombarded Callao, and although
the place was not strongly fortified the
Spaniards, not meeting with much suc
cess, withdrew their fleet and left the
waters of the Pacific.
As we pass in review the foregoing
facts and surrounding circumstances we
are reminded of the expression made by
one of the Queens of England in the
seventeenth century when considering
some of the laws. She exclaimed: "I did
not know that there was such a differ
ence between the laws of God and the
laws of man."
Let us turn our attention to the clos
ing acts of the Spanish officials at t lie
last session of the Peace Commission, rs.
The torms of peace were signed by I oth
parties, but not without several protests
and with severe strictures from Sagasta.
He declared that: "Never has a civilized
nation committed such an act of vio
lence." It was a broad charge rtgainst
one of the most generous and huv-abid
ing nations of the earth, and could not
have come from any man but a Spaniard.
In illustrating the Spanish . haracter
we do not think we have overstepped the
bounds of truth and common decency;
and we might with every degree of fair
ness cite the language of the distinguished
writer, Lord Macaulay, when he declared
in his portrayal of the Spanish race that
"Two things delight a Spaniard â to see a
horse gored by a bull and a Jew writhing
in fire."
Out of kindness for a fallen foe we
might add that his Lordship was speak
ing of the race as it existed two centuries
ago. And yet the love of the bullfight
has not ceased, though :he hatred of the
Jew may have lessened.
The Spanish people ought to learn by
this war with the United States two les
sonsâto be more charitable to nations of
lesser power and that industry, intelli
gence and economy bring wealth to the
people and to the nation.
FREDERIC HAH*
TO AMEND THE
DEBTOR LAW
Editor The Call-Dear Sir: It is with
a feeling of confidence that you will
give any matter which affects the in
terests of the retail merchants of this
State your most careful consideration
that we address you in regard to the
amendments which we hope to nm
made this year to the present debtor
laws.
It has been falsely stated that we
urge the passage of a bill that would
result in imprisonment for debt, mis
ig untrue. Â
The law as we would have it would
not inflict any punishment on a man
because he could not pay his bills.
It will, however, result in making
those who can pay, but seek to avoid,
the payment by dishonest means, reim
burse the retailer.
Surely this is only fair and right, tor
it is evident that the man who buys
necessaries of life for the use of him
self and his family, and does so with
the intention of defrauding the store
keeper out uf the payment of the same,
although able to pay for them, is as
much a thief as the man who takes the
goods without the storekeeper's knowl-
edge.
It is urged that under the law as we
would have it Judges wcruld order pay
ment from those financially unable to
obey the order. This presupposes the
entire bench of the State to be dishon
est and unprincipled. We think such a
hypothesis hardly correct.
A copy of the proposed law is in
closed. We would urge you to read it
carefully. The necessity for its passage
will become evident to you when you
learn that in San Francisco alone there
are over two thousand well-to-do pro
fessional beats, who make use of our
present lax laws to defraud the retail
merchant. These persons, according to
the latest report of the collection bu
reau of the Retail Grocers' Association
and the Butchers' Board of Trade, owe
our merchants over $30,000, which they
can pay, but will not because the law
at present does not enable the mer
chants to reach them. This same state
at affairs exists all over the State of
California.
That imprisonment for debt is con
trary to the public welfare cannot be
questioned. As responsible citizens and
taxpayers the members of our two
associations would protest against the
passage of a law that would work in
jury to our citizens. At the same time
we feel that we are entitled to a cer
tain protection, and we look to you to
assist us in this important matter as
far as you feel you can consistently do
so. Yours very truly.

RETURN OF
A FAVORITE
Miss Bernice Holmes, the Popular
Contralto, Will Reappear at the
Tivoli in a Few Days in
Leading Parts.
AFRESH treat is in store for
the patrons of the Tivoli.
The management has en
tered into a contract with
Bernice Holmes, who
scored a hit in this city a couple
of years ago.
Miss Holmes Is known all over
the country as a contralto, and
her sweet voice, combined with
her easy, graceful manner, has
made her a universal favorite on
and off the stage. Two years ago
she took leadine: parts at the
Tivoli and her return will be
hailed with joy. Since that time
she has been with the Castle
Square Opera Company in Bos
ton, Philadelphia and New York
and later with the Murray Lane
Opera Company in Chicago.
Miss Holmes will arrive in this
city next Monday night and will
make her first appearance a week
later. She will take the leading
part in all contralto roles during
the season.
THE CORPORATIONS
WERE ALL TOO EASY
"NO TRICK TO FOOL THEM,"
SAYS GOLDIN.
An Illustration of How to Beat the
Unbeatable Given by the
Magician.
A short, stout, clean-shaven youth, with
a Senatorial candidate smile and a large
crowd of men and boys at his heels, Im
peded traffic on Market street for two
hours yesterday afternoon. The center of
attraction was Horace Goldin, the magi
cian, and his following was picked up
from the various stores where he had been
shopping.
"I want some collar-buttons," said Gold
in to a clerk in one of the jewelry stores. '
Tray after tray was brought down for
inspection, but the illusionist could find
nothing that satisfied him. He swallowed
buttons by the score, drew them from the
pockets of the spectators, the ears of the
clerk and the bottoms of the trays, until
the bewildered proprietor gave up in dis
gust.
"What kind of buttons do you use?" he
inquired.
"Well, you see, I drink so much water
that my collar-buttons rust, and I want
I some that won't give me blood poison
| ing." C " ;
I A few minutes later the wizard was
' lined up in front of the Pullman office
window in the Southern Pacific ticket
office.
"What is the cost of a berth to Los
Angeles?" he asked.
"Two fifty," replied the clerk.
"Why didn't you say five dollars," quer
ied Goldin. "Id beat you down to three
and think I had a bargain."
"Two fifty," answered the clerk, with a
I frown.
"Will you take five half-dollars?"
"Yea, sir." *Â» l
"There you areâ one, two, three, four,
! five. Is that correct?"
"Correct," said the clerk, sweeping the
i money into his hand.
"Pardon me," interrupted Goldin.
"Maybe your company is poor and you
lit. I the money. You had better count v
again."
The clerk did so and found himself a
half-dollar short. He blushed and
stretched out his hand for the extra four
l.it piece. Goldin placed it in his hand
and asked him to close his fingers over the
I coin to make sure it did not slip away.
j When the astonished clerk opened his
| hand he found an old English ~enny in
i his palm. By this time an interested
i crowd of spectators had gathered about
the wicket.
"They warned me to be careful of these
railway officials," continued the magician.
"but 1 never thought this messenger boy
would hold me up so," and making a pass
at the astonished messenger Goldin pulled
halves, dollars, fives, tens and twenties
"in the astonished boy's clothing until
' the lad rushed behind the railing. Toss
ing a half-dollar to the clerk Goldin walk
ed out, remarking as he passed through
the door: "It aint so much of a much
-1 ness to fool the Southern Pacific."
Wells-Fargo's express office was next
visited. There Goldin purchased a money
I order, placing three five-dollar pieces on
the counter. The clerk wrote out the or
der, handed it to Goldin and was about
to drop the coin into the drawer when he
discovered to his astonishment that three
copper pennies had been substituted for
the gold. The magician took the pen
nies in one hand, rubbed them with his
thumb and handed them back to the
clerk with the remark that they were
genuine "fives." The employe blinked his
eyes and apologized. Goldin picked up his
â  money order, quickly tore in half and
the halves into quarters before the clerk
. gasped out, "You have ruined your order,
man. I'll have to cancel the stub and
give you another."
"What's the matter with this?" asked
: Golden. "Ain't it all right? Just a little
: crumpled; that's all," and he smoothed
out the order intact.
"These corporations are too easy alto
gether." concluded the magician. "I
think I'll go to Sacramento and get a job
handing out gold bricks to the office
| seekers."
CATCHING A SCHOONER.
Captain Alexander Tries to Evade
Entering His Vessel at the
Custom House.
Captain Alexander Â«t the sealing
schooner Enterprise has been f>ut to con
siderable expense because of his desire to
be economical at the expense of the har
bor regulations. He wanted to avoid .en
tering at the Custom-house but was
thwarted in his designs by the vigilance
of Surveyor Bpear.
The Enterprise arrived on December 31,
and the captain announced that he had
put into port for the purpose of waiting
tor it bomb gun, being at that time on
his way to the southern seal flshing
grounds. On January 3 he went to sea
and lay off the Cliff House until night,
when he sneaked in under cover of the
darkness.
As the customs regulations require that
a vessel must have gone at least three
leagues from land before escaping the
jurisdiction of the Custom-house, Survey
or Spear placed Inspector Henry on
board with orders not to allow the
schooner to pail without having been duly
entered at the Custom-house. Yesterday
Captain Alexander spread his sails, haul
ed up his anchor and announced his in
tention of going to sea and taking In
spector Her.ry with him.
The alarm w:is given at once and the
steam launch from the United States rev
enue cutter Rush overhauled the schoon
er before she reached me Golden Gate.
Captain Alexander saw that the game
was lost, and in order to avoid the wrath
of Uncle Sam duly entered his vessel and
was allowed to depart in chagrin.

FIREMAN MOULD'S ARM
AMPUTATED AT SHOULDER
ACCIDENT ON THE NORTH PA-
CIFIC COAST RAILROAD.
Drawbar Between Engine and Tender
Breaks and Five Cars Pass Over
the Unfortunate Man.
Charles Mould, a fireman on engine 13
of the San Francisco and North Pacific
Coast Railroad, was seriously Injured on
Tuesday afternoon in an accident whi'jh
occurred about a quarter of a mile north
of Hopland. The engine was pulling a
special train of stock from Uklah to
Shellville, when the drawbar connecting
it with the tender broke. Mould fell in
front of the tender and his left arm was
badly crushed. The tender and five cars
passed over his arm. He was also severe
ly injured about the head.
Mould was Taken to the Hopland TTo-el,
where Dr. Bea attended to him. Con
ductor I rane ;i.-kÂ«d for another en-fine
went with It to Vkiah for another
physician. The services of Dr. Stout were
obtained, and he returned with the train
t . Hopland and amputated Mould's arm
at the shoulder. Mould, although suffer
ing very much from loss of blood, came
through the operation exceedingly well

recently, was conductor on the same line

Y. M. C. jJL. ANNUAL DINNER.
Third Indoor Baseball Game at Reli-
ance Club To-Night.
The annual dinner of members of the
Young Men's Christian Association was
held last night in this city. The chair
was taken by General Secretary H. J.
McCoy, and about 250 sat down to the
dinner, which was given by the Mothers'
Club, the president of which is Mrs. C.
S. Wright. W. M. Parsons, the new State
secreViry, who has just arrived in Cali
fornia from St. LÂ«ouis, made an eloquent
speech.
The chairman suggested that the com
pany present should divide Itself into
two clubs for the purpose of increasing
the membership of the organization as
largely as possible, the clubs to contend
with each other, and the club securing
the largest number of new members at
the end of three months to receive a din
ner at the expense of the losing club.
One hundred and two young men pledged
themselves to do their utmost, and were
divided into two clubs of fifty-one each,
one having for its leader C. J. Anger and
for its secretary \V. N. Ilolliday, and the
other having as leader J. B, Thornburg
and as secretary W. Hutton. Short
speeches were made by several members,
and at about 9 o'clock, after singing a
verse of "My Country, 'Tis of Thee," the
company dispersed.
This evening the Y. .M. C. A. indoor
baseball team will go over to Oakland
to play against the nine of the Reliance
Athletic Club. The teams have met twice
before on the first occasion in this city,
when the San Francisco team won by a
score of 17 to 15, and on the second occa
sion in Oakland, when the Reliance team
won by a score of 20 to 17. The San
Francisco team is made up as follows:
Barbour. pitcher; Foran, catcher; Me
' Shane, first base; Armstrong, shortstop;
! Hanrahan, third base; Toohy, right field;
j Spacher, left field; Shaw, longstop; Scott,
second base.
Aj botn teams have considerably im
proved since they last met, a hard and
lively game is expected. It will be ladies'
night at the Reliance Club's rooni3.

CHALMERS WAS
IGNORED BY
CAPT. SMITH
Ordered the Doric to
Lie in the Stream.
THE VESSEL WAS DOCKED
FEDERAL OFFICERS PASSED THE
SHIPâ THE STATE DIDN'T.
Dr. Chalmers Was Angry Because the
Steamer Had Crossed the Quar
antine Line, So Refused
to Examine Her.
The Paciflo Mail Company's steamer
Doric arrived from Hongkong, via Yoko
hama and Honolulu, last evening, and
after being passed by Dr. Brooks of the
Federal Quarantine Office Captain Smith
took his vessel to the dock at Jfirst and
Brannan streets, despite the fact that Dr.
Chalmers of the State Quarantine Office
refused to examine the ship and ordered
the commander to anchor in the stream.
When the Doric came In through the
heads shortly before 5 o'clock she was
boarded by Dr. Brooks, who, after mak
ing an examination, gave her free pra
tique. While waiting for the Caroline to
take off the Chinese passengers Captain
Brooks crossed into the quarantine
grounds. Dr. Chalmers came aboard as
the Doric lay at anchor off Angel Island.
The doctor was very angry that the rules
of the State Quarantine Office had been
violated. He refused to examine the ves
sel and ordered Captain Smith to remain
in the stream until this morning, when he
would visit the ship and examine her bill
of health.
As .soon as the vessel had been passed
by Dr. Brooks, Deputy Surveyor of the
Port Chauncey St. John notified Captain
Smith that he could proceed to his dock.
The commander availed himself of the
permission, ignoring Dr. Chalmers. Cap
tain Smith believes the Quarantine Officer
will have him arrested, but is not much
worried over the matter.
The Doric made the passage from Hong
kong in 28 days lti hours 40 minutes; from
Yokohama in 16 days IB*i hours, and from
Honolulu in 6% days. According to Chief
Engineer Allen, the trip was the best ever
made by the vessel, taking into considera
tion the fact that heavy head winds were
encountered throughout the voyage.
Fifty-four cabin and 112 steerago pas
sengers were on the ship. Among the
passengers were twelve discharged sol
diers from the Twenty-third and Eigh
teenth regiments, and ten Spanish priests
from Manila on their way to Panama.
Captain Steele of the Eighteenth Regi
ment, at present stationed at Cavite, came
over on the Doric. He is home on sick
leave, and will go to his old -'home in
South ( 'arolina in a few days. Captain
Sieele says that while there has been con
siderable sickness and a number of deaths
among the soldiers, the health of the men
has greatly improved in the past few
months. The passenger list follows:
Captain Steele, Lieutenant Colonel I. Altl
mara. Lieutenant B. E. Calkins, P. Diaz, Ft.
Diaz, J. Diaz, T. F. Dredge. A. H. Emanuel.

TERMINAL FACILITIES
FOR THE VALLEY ROAD
Captain Payson Has Gone East to
Arrange for Their Early Con
struction.
Captain A. 11. Payson, who is the rep
resentative of the Santa Fe in the direc
torate of the Valley road, left for the
East on Wednesday for an important con
ference with the officials of the Santa Fe
relative to terminal facilities and other
improvements in connection with the Val
ley road.
It is understood that he will discuss the
construction of wharves, piers and freight
and passenger depots at Point Richmond,
and the improvement of the Santa he's
newly acquired water front property at
the foot of Spear street, in this city, as
well as the construction of ferry boats to
ply between this city and Point Rich
mond. It is not improbable that on his
return he will bring authority to make
contracts for these improvements, and
that they will be pressed to completion
with the same energy and expedition that
has characterized the work in the con
struction of the Valley road.
FOUR FIREMEN FINED.
The Fire Commissioners Make Sev
eTal Appointments and Pro

sued the following order, specifying the |
manner in which war tax stamps shall be j
canceled:
Existing regulations are hereby amended so
as to require that upon earh adhesive docu
mentary or proprietary stamp used or affixed
after January 1, IS9'.\ there shall, In addition
to the initials of the person using the same
and the year In which used, also appear the

was used or affixed. The month may be ex
pressed by numerals â for Instance, on a stamp
used on January 12, 1539. the date may be
written or stamped, 1-12-99.
Illustrated Lecture on the War.
J. W. Erwln, president of the California
Camera Club, will tell the story of our
late war with Spain to-night in the First
Lutheran Church, Geary and Octavqia
streets. Like, ail Mr. Erwin's lectures, it
will be well illustrated with beautiful
stereopticon views.
These latter are representations of the
proverbial wideawakedness of the Amer
ican newspaper man, with pictures
of the naval battle in Santiago harbor,
and numerous other views of the land en
gagements at Manila.
Illegal Fisher Punished.
Those who violate the fish and gamo
laws of Sonoma County get short shrift
when their guilt is established. A few
days ago Deputy Pieh Commissioners
Davis and Cross arrested Lorenze Mar
tinez for placing a set net in the Russian
River.
The offender proved to be a native of
the island of Luzon, and he has the dis
tinction of being the first Filipino arrest
ed and convicted In this country since the
Philippine Islands nave come under the
control of the United States. He had his
preliminary examination yesterday before
Justice Brown 01 Santa Rosa and was
held for trial. The Superior Court being
in session, Martinez was at once taken
before that tribunal and pleaded guilty.
He was sentenced to pay a fine of 5100 or
be imprisoned for fifty days in the county
jail, is'ot having the money, he went to
jail. Yesterday Deputies Cross and "Wil
son confiscated another set net In the
Russian River, but could not find tre
owner.

At the close of the ceremonies the mem
bership of the court and invited guests
formed in procession to tue number of
about one hundred and fifty and marched
to Frank's, where i..ey partook of a ban
quet, the disposition of the good things
furnished occupying more than two hour 3.
P. H. Livingston was master of cere
monies, and between courses called upon
those who were selected to respond to
toasts. Those who occupied se-us of hon
or at the head of the table were: Jacob
Samuels, gTand chief ranger; John J.
Cordy, grand secretary; hugo K. Asher,
grand senior warden; George AY. Beyruth,
district denuty, and Jacob L...bel of the
American Forester Review.
Hugo K. Asher responded to "Our Or
der"; Kelly and Marlowe favored with
vocal selections; Louis Kragen responded
to "The Duties of Man," an . at the close
of his response presented Dernitv Bey
ruth with a beautiful gold watch and
chain as a token of the court's admira
tion of his services on behalf of the mem
bership and the order. R. Mender enter
tained with funny stories and coon son-s.
E. C. Stock responded to "The Press" and
Jacob Label to "The Fraternal Press."
Grand Chief Ranger Jacob Samuels re
sponded to the "Executive Council."
Grand Secretary Cordy responded to "The
Finances of the Order," and in his re
marks said that from the returns re
cpived for the term it is safe to say the
order will within a very short time have
a numerical showing of 13,000 in this
State. Mr. Cofdy was followed by other
speakers and special numbers.
EIGHTH REGIMENT TO
BE MUSTERED OUT
THE WELCOME ORDERS HAVE
AT LAST BEEN ISSUED.
The Companies "Will All Be Dis
banded at Their Present
Stations.
Orders providing- for the final muster-
Ing out of the Eighth California Regi
ment were issued yesterday. They pro
vide that the various companies shall be
discharged from the service at the vari
ous points where they are now stationed.
Four companies are at Vancouver Bar
racks, In the Department of Columbia.
The others are located at the following
places: Benicia, two companies; Angel
Island, one company; Presidio, three com
panies; Alcatraz Island, one company.
Captains Pratt and Davis will muster
out the companies within the Jurisdiction
of the Department of California. It is
not yet known who will conduct the dis
charge of the troops at Vancouver bar
racks.
Batteries B and C of the California
Heavy Artillery will also be mustered
out. Battery B is stationed at Angel Isl
am! and Battery C at Canby.
The life of the Eighth California has
been one long history of disappointments, j
The boys expected to go to Manila among
the first, and when they found that this i
could not be expected they clamored for
dismissal from the service. Then the
hope that they might go to Honolulu was
held out, but this plan also failed, and !
the nus^erine out will probably come as I
a relief to the volunteers, weary of the I
monotony of guard duty.
New Trap-Shooting Club.
A meeting of representative sportsmen
was held in room 38, Crocker building,
last night for the purpose of forming a
new trap-shooting club. Permanent or
ganization was effected, and the following

president; C. H. Shaw, vice president;

/"I know a Mrs. Curry, who lives in Tennessee," said the
rofessor, "who never had any trouble with her health, aside
from rheumatism, until after she was sixty years of age, but
then there came some derangement of the digestive organs, and
at the suggestion of her daughter, with whom she was living,
she tried Ripans Tabules and was benefited immediately. Now
she keeps them in the house all the time, and generally takes
one just after eating. She finds that it cures any irregularities
of the bowels, and says that, in her opinion, no family should

LANSING, Mich., Jan. s.â Governor
Pingree to-day read his message to the
Joint session of the Legislature. The
G.overnor congratulates the State on its
ress and the - ra of prosperity which
â is opening befon it. Equal taxation he
ts of at length, Baying that it is
ih" most important question in the
to-day, and that the present
State administration was put into pow
â¢ er expressly to take some action look-
Ing to an equitable system of taxation.
He argued that railroads and other cor
porations should be brought under the
general tax law. Instead of being as
d upon their gross earnings as at
present. He recommends the repeal of
â¢ the special charters of the Michigan
Central and Detroit, Grand Haven and i
Milwaukee roads so as to bring them
under the general laws. The attempt
fit the special session last spring to pass
the Atkinson bill, which has eaual tax
ation for its object, is referred to and
the Governor criticizes some of the

against it. â¢
The Governor favors a moderate in

Governor. He advocates that Congress
SIR HENRY IRVING
ILL AND IN NEED
Health Shattered and
Fortune Lost.
RETIRES FROM THE STAGE
FRIENDS RAISING A FUND IN
HIS BEHALF.
Famous Actor Broken Physically and
Financially by Overwork and
Repeated Business
Failures.
I Dlpp^tch to .The Call.
NJ3W YORK. Jan. f).â The Herald will
s;iy t ..-morrow:- There have been bo
many mysterious rumors as to the "true
.inwardness" rf sir Henry living's en
deavor to lease his London- theater, and
the real facts in the case have been so
misstated ami distorted that it is as
well to give the public the whole truth
of the affair.
Sir Henry Irving's condition for some
time pert has caused his friends seri
ous concern. .
Both physically and financially he is
in much distress*, broken, in health â
not beyond mending, perhapsâ and seri
tmsly crippled in his business affairs by
the disastrous failure of several most
elaborate and expensive productions at
the Lyceum. Overwork and public fail
ure which have been an intense strain
upon a man i ; peculiarly sensitive or
ganism and the.a dded demands upon
his sti-ength duet,o his social entertain
ments after an evening's work upon
the stage have wrecked his health and
ruined his once iarge fortune. He is
now at iiournemouth seeking the re
covery <>f his Btrt ngth and his most in
timate friends are endeavoring to raise
a substantial fund which shall provide
for his needs during the remainder of
his life.
Irving took into his confidence some
time since a number, of his friends and
told them candidly, of the straits to
which he had been reduced by recent
losses and asked for their assistance
and advice. These were men who not
onl? Were admirer* of the actor and
who had abundant means fit their com
mand, but men of good practical busi
.i^ well.
They were very fond of Irving, as is
all London, and they would have done
anything in their power financially to
aid him were- it a' mere' question of
pounds, shillings and .pence. But, re
garding the actor physically as well as
the situation financially, they saw the
future was decidedly doubtful, if not
hopeless, and that if they acted the
part of real friendship they would coun
sel him to retire from the stage â at all
ts from the ownership and direc
tion of the Lyceumâ and seek the re
covery of his health.
How much they told him of what they
law in th..- future is neither here
nor there. But shortly afterward a
number of gentlemen in England and
on the Continent were applied to and
pledged themselves to provide a fund
for his use when the apparently in
evitable retirement should occur.
Meanwhile the actor, hopeful of re
sults of his re.st at Bournemouth, is
eagerly planning the leasing of the
Lyceum and the undertaking of another
American tour which shall recoup his
fortunes and which, they say in Eng
land, he has asked Charles Frohman to
manage for him.

VICTORIA, Jan. s.â An announce
ment of the utmost importance, par
ticularly to Americans who have inter
ests in the Atlin mining district in the
far north of British Columbia, was
made in the speech from the throne,
given by Lieutenant Governor Mclnnes,
at the opening of the provincial Legisla
ture of British Columbia this afternoon.
Lieutenant Governor Mclnnes said in
part after congratulating the members
on the prosperity and bright prospects:
In nearly all the leading industries of
the province growth and improved condi
tions are observed. The output of the
coal mines largely exceeded' that of the
previous year and is likely to continue
to increase. The development of the
quartz mines, especially those in Koote
nay, has been most satisfactory, while
a like activity to that which has occurred
there, it seems probable maj Boon be wit
nessed in the Boundary Creek district,
when, by the completion of the railway
now in progress of construction, the im
mense bodies of ore known to exist there
can be profitably developed. On the wt st
coasts uf the mainland and Island there
is also every probability of considerable
mining developments shortly taking
place.
There is also likely to be a large in
crease within the present year in placer
and hydraulic mining operations. Al
ready some Large enterprises of this char
acter have been put into successful ope
ration in Cariboo and on a smaller scale
in the Omineca district, while the recent
discoveries at Atlin Lake, in the north
ern part of the province, nave disclosed
deposits of auriferous gravel, rich in
quality and spread over a large area. In
anticipation of an influx of population
Into that region my government has al
ready taken steps for the proper admin
istration of the district. In order to con
serve the natural wealth in these gold
gravels for the benefit of Canadian min
ers and Canadian traders a bill will be
laid before you prohibiting the acqui
sition of placer claims by aliens.

HONOLULU, Dec. 30.â The revenue
cutter McCulloch, Captain C. L.
Hooper, arrived from Manila on the
28th, on her way to San Francisco.
Early in November she received orders
detaching her from the fleet and di
recting: her to resume her around-the
world cruise as a revenue cutter. Un
der Dewey's direction she was put into
as many Chinese and Japanese ports
as possible, "in order to show the flag."
She left Manila on November 16, Hong
kong on November 23 and Amoy on
November 26. At Amoy, described as
the dirtiest city in the world, the Chi
nese admiral of the province was enter
tained aboard her and saw for the lirst
time in his life modern guns. The Mc-
Culloch -was in Shanghai on December
1 and at Nagasaki on December 4. At
that time the treaty of peace had not
been signed, and the Japanese Govern
ment, treating her as a war vessel,
would not allow her to remain more
than twenty-four hours. Kobe and Yo
kohama were visited, and the vessel
sailed on December 16 from the latter
port after a stay of six days, reaching
here in fourteen days over perfectly
tranquil seas. She will remain but a
few daysâ just long enough to take on
about 200 tons of coal and to do some
painting.
When the McCulloch was detached
from Dewey's fleet the additional guns
that had been mounted on her were re
turned to the navy and their places
supplied by some guns taken from the
Reina Christina. One of these bears on
the crank handle marks of where it was
hit by American shot during the bat
tle.
On the forward deck is an old rifled
bronze cannon, bearing: the crown and
monogram of Isabella II of Spain It
is destined to be melted and cast into
medals for the benefit of the Maine
monument fund. In the captain's
cabin is a beautiful gold lined sliver
loving cup, presented to the vessel by
tho children of Hugh McCulloch
Five deep sea vessels arrived in port
yesterday. They were the Doric, from
the Orient; the W. F. Babcock from
Baltimore; the Diamond Head and
Willscott, from Nanaimo, and the W
H. Dimond, from San Francisco. The
Euterpe, from the coast, and the Kan
aura Maru from Yokohama are mo
mentarily expected. The Babcock
brings coal for the United States Gov
ernment, and is chartered to carry
sugar around the Horn.
The Doric brought 622 Japanese and
ninety-three Chinese for this port, be
sides a large quantity of merchandise
The decision in the Chinese habeas cor
pus cases has not yet been rendered,
and the fight will be resumed over the
Chinese who arrived to-day.

HOW BRESMES
ESCAPED FROM
THE AMERICANS
Many CubaQS Believe That \\z

struction of tfye
MaiQe.
O HAVANA, Jan. 5. â Interesting revelations concerning the flight O
O of Zacarias Bresmes, who is charged with complicity in destroying O
O the Maine, were made to-day. Bresmes was a magistrate in the pre- O
O liminary court, having been appointed by Weyler, one of whose crea- O
O tures he was. His position was one of considerable i sponsibility O
O and no salary, yet Bresmes was one of the most lavish spenders of O
Â© money in Havana. His manner of conducting his court had so long Â©
Â© been a scandal that it ceased to attract special attention, and his in- O
Â© fluence was so great that it was known to be useless to attempt his O
O punishment. Â©
Â© Cubans who were convinced of his criminality in connection with Â©
O the destruction of the Maine remained silent, hoping to secure his O
O punishment after American occupation had been realized. O
O In the meantime the war was fought and the protocol signed, O
O and Bresmes then became nervous and began preparations for a trip O
O to Spain. O
O Judge Villalba, a Cuban who is both able and honest, then enter- O
O tamed charges against Bresmes on one of many cases. His action O
O rendered him liable to General Arolas, whose anxiety to place upon Â©
O Captain Sigsbee the responsibility for the Maine's destruction made O
Â© him conspicuous last winter. Arolas interfered to save Bresmes, Â©
O getting Blanco's ear, and persuaded the latter to order Villalba to send O
O all important papers relating to Bresmes to him and drop all proceed- O
O ings against him. Villalba refused to do this and defied both Arolas Â©
O and Blanco, issuing an order for Bresmes' arrest. This was reported O
Â© at the palace and Blanco removed Bresmes from the danger of fall- Q
Â© ing into the hands of the Yankees by allowing him to go aboard the O
O transport Covadonga, on which he sailed for Spain, where he is now O
O in hiding. q

SANTIAGO IS

Will Retain the Customs
Receipts.
WORK WILL BE CONTINUED
TAXATION WITHOUT REPRE
SENTATION NOT DESIRABLE.
Complaint Made That Havana Has
Tattened at the Expense of the
Whole Island of
Cuba.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTIAGO, Cuba, Jan. s.â The ex
planation of the War Department at
Washington of its intentions regarding
the transfer of customs receipts from
the different ports in Cuba to Havana
is met here by statements from the Cu
bans that the plan is similar to the one
adopted by the Spaniards, when requi
sitions on Havana obtained less than 6
per cent of what the requisition called
for. The merchants, business men and
influential people here say Havana has
grown rich and prosperous at the ex
pense of the rest of the island, and the
Cubans and governmental officials at
Santiago say the Cubans of Havana are
responsible for Major General Brooke's
order on this subject. The people here
add that the Havana Cubans are still
anxious to maintain the same system of
centralization of funds that was in
force before the American occupation.
A dispatch was received from Ha
vana to-day saying that the customs
receipts may remain in Santiago. The
effects of this information are good and
particularly so, so far as the laborers
are concerned.
Senor Bacardi, the Mayor, has as
sured the laborers that all work now in
progress will go on, and therefore
there is not likely to be any immediate
trouble. But educated Cubans, the
members of the San Carlos Club, the
Judges of the Supreme Court, the local
newspapers, and Cuban and foreign
merchants here agree that the situation
is substantially unchanged and that
any such projects as was originally out
lined simply means taxation without
representation. Their argument is that
General Brooke, residing at Havana,
will always be antagonistic to the in
terests of the province of Santiago and
likely to object to necessary expendi
ture iri-tL'is section. Prominent Cubans
emphatically assert that if a Cuban
Government should assume to issue
such an order â concentrating the cus
toms receipts at Havana â civil war
would break out immediately. It is
hoped that a civil government may be
established in every province, distinct
from the rule of the governor general,
who should be merely the military chief
of the island.
Dr. Castillo and Mayor Bacardi have
proved true in this crisis and have
urged the citizens to remain peaceful
while waiting the results of the visit of
General Wood and Dr. Castello to
Washington.
General Wood, accompanied by his
aid de camp, Lieutenant Hanna, and
Dr. Castello, representing the mer
chants and business men of this city,
left here for New York to-day on board
the United States transport Mississippi.
They were accorded an enthusiastic
send-off from the palace and during
their passage doVn Marian street to
the wharf. The municipal band pre
ceded General Wood, who was accom
panied by the Mayor and his staff and
large numbers of officers and Cubans,
who walked the entire distance amid
continuous applause and cheers for
General Wood.
The latter was deeply moved. There
â were between 5000 and 6000 persons in
the procession, and the women wept
and wished the general bon voyage.
Cuban gratitude was neveV more clear
ly expressed. Men, who a few weeks
ago were antagonistic to the American
commander, were to-day among his
most enthusiastic supporters.
The members of the Supreme Court
and the band of the Fifth Regular In
fantry were on board the auxiliary
gunboat Hist, which saluted the Mis
sissippi and bade her farewell In tho
usual manner. The Mississippi, which
was brilliantly decorated, was also aa
luted by the Punta Gorda batteries.

ANTI-SEMITISM
IN NEW YORK
Former Rabbi Depre
cates Its Growth.
SAYS HEBREWS ARE ABUSED
ADDRESSES AN APPEAL TO THE
PRESIDENT.
Cites Instances Where Jews Have
Been Persecuted by Roughs,
While Police Refused
to Interfere.
Special Dlspetch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. s.â The alleged
anti-Semitic prejudice existing in this
country and displayed in a steady in
crease of acts of violence toward the
Jews in the poorer Quarters of Manhat
tan and Brooklyn, was made the sub
ject of a lengthy letter sent on New
Year's day to President McKinley by
Leopold Conn of Brooklyn. The writer
was once a Jewish rabbi, but was con
verted to Christian belief seven years
ago in this city and joined the Baptist
church. He is now conducting mission
ary work among the people of his race
and has charge of the interests of three
missions.
Mr. Cohn, in his communication to
the President, states that in the prose
cution of his missionary work he has
had continuously thrust upon his notice
the ever-increasing hatred displayed in
this city toward the Jew, until he has
found it his imperative duty to sound
a note of warning. The letter contin
ues:
Peaceful Jews walking the streets of
this city are habitually called by oppro
brious epithets or are loudly hooted and
insulted, as though they were mounte
banks or criminals, and when the threat
ening shout will not attract response
then the throwing of mud and stones is
resorted to, and, I repeat, not in an iso
lated Instance but constantly as the
weeks pass, and as a result of it many
persons have been injured, sometimes
seriously.
When a streetcar passes through the
Jewish quarter, hooting, hissing and call
ing of names from Its platforms are cus
tomary Incidents, and within these public
cara 1 have seen Jews pulled by the beard
and pushed from one man to another and
back again like a. football, in which horse
play the conductors have themselves par
ticipated, and in some cases, which 1 am
ready to prove, these actions have crip
pled the victims for life. A Jew with a
push cart is everywhere esteemed as a
legitimate object to be mobbed and
robbed.
On one occasion I saw a Jewish peddler
with horse and wagon set upon by a mob
of large boys with stones, the man trying
to protect himself by drawing his coat
over his head. On running to his defense
I was myself attacked; on appealing to a
group of citizens and admitting, upon
their questioning, that the victim was a
Jew, they laughed boisterously, adding,
with an evident sneer, that I was mysolf
of the same despised race; and upon my
then appealing to a policeman he coolly
replied, after great deliberation, that the
affuir was not on his beat. In the mean
time, with his head bleeding, the peddler
was driven from his wagon and the wagon
looted and overturned.
Another case, similar except that the
wares were scattered about the street,
though not stolen, occurred in front of the
Boys' High School, where young gentle
men are prepared for college at the public
expense, largely paid from Jewish taxes.
The aggressors were the students, and
the teachers viewed the scene from the
windows.
These incidentsâ a few selected from
many corning unsought under my personal
observation, must not be esteemed merely
as occasional disorders, liable to occur
under the best procurable condition, but
rather as manifestations of a prevalent,
widespread, deepening and expanding
public sentiment fraught with the gravest
consequences to the wellbeing of the na
tion.
Copies of the letter to the President
were sent to the Board of Education
and to Mayor Van Wyck by Mr. Cohn,
with the suggestion that the growing
taint of anti-Semitism be made the
subject of a series of lectures in the
schools.
Mr. Cohn said he did not expect re
plies to either of his letters, but intends
to address communications from time
to time to the leading men of the city-
State and nation, calling attention to
the threatening growth of anti-Semi
ism.

TO IMPROVE THE
SACRAMENTO RIVER
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. s.â Both Assembly and Sen
ate this morning gave hearty approval to
the work that has been done In the two
years by the Sacramento River Commis
sioners by adopting an Assembly con
current resolution calling upon Congress
to use every means to bring about the
execution of the plans prepared by the
commission for the improvement of the
river.
The commission as constituted at pres
ent was created in 1897 for the purpose of
deciding upon the best way of preserving
the Sacramento as a navigable stream,
and $300,000 was appropriated as a starter
for the work. After two years of almost
constant labor plans nave been drawn
which it is said solve the troublesome
problem. The resolution of approval
passed the Assembly without a dissenting
voice and was immediately sent to the
Senate, wheÂ»e it was called up by Cutter
of Yuba, author of the original bill. It
passed the Senate as Quickly as In the
house, and is now in the hands ot
the Governor.
Its provisions are as follows:
\\ bi reas, the Sacramento River Commission,
ed of Federal engineers appointed by the
President of the United States, have, in ac
cordance with the duty devolved^ upon them,
reported to the Congress oÂ£ the United states
a plan for the improvement of the Sacramento
Uiv.-r, which plan is now under consideration
by the Committee of Rivera an. l Harbors of the
douai entatlves; and
Whereas, the State of California has appro
priated the sum of $3uu,000, to be expended in
the Improvement and rectification of the navi
gable waterways of this State, and has thus
Shown its willingness to assist in the work so
Imperatively demanded by the needs of com
merce and which cannot with safety be longer
â 1, and which of right ought to be un
dertaken and carried forward to completion
by the General Government; and
Whereas, the conditions of said river are
such that immediate action is necessary to
preserve it as a navigable stream for the pur
commerce.
Ived, by the Senate and Assembly of the
: California, Jointly, That our Senators
in Congress be instructed and i.ur Representa
tives be requested to use all honorable means
at their disposal to secure the execution of the
plans reported by the said Sacramento River
Commission, and to secure the appropriation
recommended by said commission for the pur
pose of carrying said plans into effect; and
that we dv further respectfully request the
said Committee on Rivers anil Harbors of the
entatlves to make the appro
:. recommended by said Sacramento
River Commission, conformably to their report
with the chief engineer of the United
States ("nriis of Knginr-tTP at "Washington.
Resolved, That the Governor be and he Is

JUDGE E. C. HART
IS LYING VERY ILL
<\\L!\ UKADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 5. â A rumor was circulated
around the Btreeta to-night that E. C.
Hart, Superior Judge of this city and
county and secretary of the Republican
Central Committee, had suffered a para
lytic stroke and was lying at the point
of death at his residence, 2503 X street.
A Call correspondent visited the Judge's
home and was told that while he was ill
his condition was not as serious as had
been reported. His brother, S. R. Hart,
Btated that the Judge had been taken
sick three days ago, and although he
was in a weak condition he attended the
initial session oÂ£ the Legislature and ad
ministered the customary oath. The at
tack was aggravated by a touch of rheu
matism, and he thought his brother
would not be out for a few days.
Another brother. Dr. A. C. Hart, is at
tending him, and every effort is being
made to alleviate his suffering. Judge
Hart has gained prominence not only on
the bench but as secretary of the local
State Central Committee. He has
worked hard for the party, and it is
d that his illness is the outcome of
his untiring efforts in its behalf. Gen
eral A, L. Hart, the well known attorney
now practicing in San Francisco, is also
his brother.

The majority caucus to-day decided
that no bills would be allowed to be intro

sequently the sessions to-morrow and Sat
urday will amount to nothing more that
formal rollcalls with the possible adop

ANDREW JACKSON'S LIBRARY,
Autograph Letter of Byron at trie
Hermitage.
Throe members of the board of directors
of the Ladies' Hermitage Association
visited the Hermitage yesterday for the
purpose of consulting- with Mrs. Rachel
Jackson Lawrence concerning; the relir
ting of thp library adjoining General
Jackson's bedroom. The books belonging
to the Jackson library comprise works of
fiction, history, biography, travel, poems,
and are, in fact, a very interesting and
valuable collection of miscellaneous
works. There are enough to fill the five
book casts purchased. In looking over
the collection yesterday the ladies were
attracted to a handsomely bound copy
of Byron's poems, and, opening it, found
therein the following very interesting
genuine autograph letter from Lord By
ron himself. It is pasted by one edge in
the front fly leaves of the book, and has
been carefully preserved all these many
years. The volume of poems has written
on the fly leaf the name of "R. E. AY".
Earle, New Orleans, January 8. 1.828."

The Lady and the Lion.
It is without a doubt a comforting re
flection thai we of the nosing nineteenth
century have emerged from the unsightly
chrysalis of an earlier stage and that the
demoralizing gladiatorial shows of the
Roman arena, round which thronged un
emancipated mankind in its thousands to
witness bloody struggles between man
and man and listen in rnpture to the
dying roars of mangled beasts, are the all
but forgotten remnants of the various
hours of a darker ace.
Yet even now a Danish lady has been
"doing immense business" at Ear! s
Court by thrusting her head within the
open jaws of a fierce lion, while others
of these terrible brutes are made by this
dauntless Amazon to leap over flaming
bars and to fire toy pistols. And one of
these days the end will come. The lady
will lose her nerve; one of the lions will
note the change; and there will be a panic
of horror-stricken spectators, who, if
they could l.'it own it. came in the half
whispered hope of something sensational,
something over and above the "triumph
of mind over matter" promised in return
for their shekels.â The Saturday Review.
England's Postage Stamps.
For the imperial penny postage to
come into operation on Christmas day it
is not Intended to produce any special
stamp, and Somerset House can meet the
increased demand out of Its large reserve.
The Controller is authorized by law to
keep a stock of Â£10,000.000 worth in the
various strong rooms on the Thames em
bankment, and, lest the outbreak of a fire
should by any mischance destroy the
stock, they are divided among several
separate parts of the gr^at building, just
as it is usual to separate a stock of gun
powder into several small detachments.
The explosion of a powder magazine
would create hardly more topsy-r;rvy!ng
in the world around than a general flare
up of our whole stock of postage stamps.
Postage stamps are not made at Somerset
House, though at one time they were all
brought there to be perforated. De la
Rue & Co. are the contractors. Our pres
ent set of stamps were adopted in Janu
ary. ISS7. and no forgeries have ever yet
been knownâ London News.
Copper Roofing.
Conner has been used for roofing very
little in this country. Tn New York there
are a few buildings having copper roofs.
Tho best known is Trinity Church, in
Broadway, opposite Wall street, which
was built over fifty yean atro. The Sun-
Treasury building in Wall street also has
a copper roof. Both have lasted many
years with very little repair. Copper
has been used in Europe from the earliest
times, and it far outlasts lead or any
other metallic roofing, but the other
metals answer the purpose and are
cheaper, so ar>> more generally used.
Tin plate is the metal roofing most
largely in use. Zinc Is also used, though
to a much less extent. Lead was much
used in former times, hut it Is heavier
and not as durable as copper.BURNS' HIRELING

ASHE EXCORIATES BURNS.
Replies to Leon Dennery's Contest of
His Election.
R. Porter Ashe has filed his answer to
.Leon Dennery's statement of his ground
of contest for the Senatorship of the'
'Twenty-fourth District,, and for various
reasons specifically set forth he asks
for a dismissal of the same. In his al
legations Ashe pours some hot shot into
Dan Burns, who has the presumption to
aspire to be "United States' Senator, and
that Burns, together with Mose
<Junst and Thomas Williams Jr., were
"the political and social friends, patrons,
followers, partisans and supporters of
Pennery," and. that they "aided and
abetted him" In â¢irregularities and viola
tions of the law.
Ashe further states that a number of
police officers, under one Sergeant Shea,
refused to perform their, sworn duty to
fetQP numerous and open violations of the
â  election laws, and particularly failed to
arrest the ruffianly frionrlÂ« of Dennery,
who were assaulting peaceable citizens
before the eyes of said officeis.
This failure to perform '.heir official
duty on the part of said officers was
â I and brought about, declares,
by the influence of Danle^ Burns, ex
;i;misFioner; : . Moses A. Gunst,
present Police Commissioner of this city
and count; ..jh W. Lees, Chief of
Police thereof, and that these la.st three
named persons openly and avowedly fa
vored, befriended and advocated the elec
tion of Dennery.
Ashe also accuses members of the Fire
Department of crowding into the election
booth in the Eleventh Precinct of the
Forty-third Assembly District and there
by impeding, obstructing and preventing
friends and supporters of Ashe from en
tering the booth to observe and watch the
counting of the ballots. They did this by
reason of a promise made by Dennery
that he would, if elected, introduce a bill
increasing the pay of the members of the
department. In this precinct Ashe
sets forth that more than twenty votes
were fraudulently taken by the t-lection
officers from him (Ashe) and counted for
Dennery.
Ashe further alleges in his answer that
ambers of the Police J^epart
mentâSerreant John B. Martin, George
Douglass, Dan Sylvester ariu Patrick Sul
livan â openly chan^oned -he cause of
Dennery; that they Intimidated and ter
d the voter* of said Senatorial dis
trict, thereby trying to induce aaid voters
to desert the cause of Ashe and espouse
the cause of Dennery; that lor one month
prior to the election said J. B. Martin
while In uniform and on duty accom
panied Dennery through the district, vis
ited saloons and during all hours of the
and alffbt gave out cards bearing
J tennery's name and kept an ample- sup
â i said cards in a store in said dia
that Douglass, SullKan and Sylves
ter threatened voters who depended upon
their, daily earnings for a live'<hood with
arrest and future prosecutions on the
; charge of vagrancy if said voters con
! tinued to advonte the election of R.
. Porter Ashe.
All fucli unlawful acts Ashe declares
; committed by Bald officers with full
knowledee and express consent of Chief
Lees and Police ' ommlssloner Gunst.
Ashe alleges that hennery spent large
I sums of money over and above the sum
: allowed by law to be expended by a can
: dldate for Senator, and has promised
other valuable considerations tn induce
voters to vote for him; that Dennery
â  paid or promised to pay one Why Levi
\ son, who was expelled from Fresno by a
vigilance committee and is now under in -
; dlctment for manslaugiiter in Portland
Or., the sum of JSOO, which was expended
in said district for furthering thÂ« election
of Dennery. Ashe further avers that
numbers of free tickets to the Oak
land racetrack were distributed by Den
nery, and said racetrack is controlled by
Thomas H. Williams Jr.. Moses A. Gunst
and Daniel ..urns; that Dennery also
1 promised to obtain employment in Golden
Park for electors in the Twenty
rtrlct as an inducement to vote
for him; that Moses A. Gunst Bpent the
sum of $SOO for the hiring of twenty-one
vehicles to parade the streets of San
Francisco for two days prior to the elec*
tion with the name of Leon Dennery in
large letters.
Each and every allegation made by
â¢ry in his complaint is denied by
who alleges that if any Irregulari
ties on the part of election officers did
occur on election day they were com
d in the interest of Dennery himself.
Ashe lays particular stress on the fact
â  that a great number of Dennery's friends
composed of ex-convicts, prize fighters
thugs, plug-uglies and other dissolute
characters, prevented a fair and impar
tial counting of the votes and caused
many of them to be counted for Dennery
which were cast for Ashe. Further that
respectable people who were Ashe's snp
ers were bullied, brow-beaten and in
sulted by said gang, including L. Stern
berg, lately pardoned from Polsom. where
hr was serving a term for false registra

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 6, 1899.
SUDDEN DEATH OF AN
OLD-TIME MERCHANT
JOHN L BARDWELL, One of the Park Benefactors,
Found Dead in Bed.
JOHN L. BARDWEIL, a retired merchant of this city, was found dead in bpd
yesterday afternoon in his room in the Hughes House, 214 Third street. The
Japanese servant went to his room at 12:45 p. m., and, receiving no reply
to his knocking, informed the landlord. The door was forced, and Bardwell's
dead body was found lying in bed disrobed and under the covers.
The last time that Bardwell was seen alive was on the evening before, and at
that time he was in good health and spirits. The room was undisturbed and
there was every indication that Mr. Bardwell passed away quietly in his sleep
from a stroke of heart disease. Mr. Bardwell was a native of Springfield,
Mass., and was 67 years old. Twenty years ago he retired from business, since
which time he has been leading a quiet life in this city. While he did not
dabble in politics, he took a lively interest in public affairs in the direction of
affording entertainment and instruction for the poor, whose playground is Golden
Gate Park. In order to add to the utility and attractiveness of that popular
resort, he made gifts of valuable curios to the Park Museum, and those gifts
are among the most appreciated in that department. He amused his declining
years by collecting curios, and the room in which he died is full of them. He
left no family, hut is believed to have a sister in Massachusetts. It is believed
that he owned considerable property, both real and personal, and it will be taken
In charge by the Public Administrator.

LEWIS OBRIN SHARP DEAD.
Sudden Passing of One of Madera's
Foremost Citizens.
MADERA, Jan. s.â Lewis Orrin Sharp ]
died at his home here early this morning ;
of heart trouble. Mr. Sharp was one of
the pioneers of this vicinity, having set
tled in Madera In 1880. He waa the father
of L. W. Sharp, one of the owners of the
Madera Weekly Tribune. Since he took
up his residence here he has been identi- )
fled with almost every public movement in
the history of the town. Although a
stanch Republican, he was appointed I
Postmaster in 18S8 under the adminlstra- >
tion of President Cleveland, holding the
office by reappointment throughout Harri
son's term.
Mr. Sharp was on the street yesterday,
and, as far as he or any one else knew,
he was enjoying his usual health. He at
tended a funeral in the afternoon, at j
which he was one of the pallbearers.
After spending a pleasant evening with |
several friends at his home he retired at
his usual time. At about midnight he waa
awakened by abnormal palpitation of the
heart and before medical assistance could
bo summoned he died. He was 59 years j
of age, and leaves a widow, three sous â

MAY UPSET THE
BOTKIN VERDICT
Man and Wife From Los Angeles
Who Can Give New Testi
mony as to Candy.
O SACRAMENTO, Jan. 6. â There is in Sacramento to-day a pen- Q
O tleman and his wife from Los Angelea, who, if what they say Is true, Q
O may be the means of upsetting the verdict in the Botkin case. As the Q
O story is told to-night it appears that this gentleman and his wife O
O were in San Francisco on the day that the box of candy which was O
O used as the vehicle for conveying the poison to Mrs. Dunning and O
O her sister in Dover was purchased at Haas' candy store. q
O It will be remembered the candy girls identified Mrs. Botkin as O
O the person who purchased the candy, and also that the box in which O
O the candy was packed was of a special make and was the only one O
O of the kind sold on that day. It now appears that the Los Angeles O
O gentleman and wife purchased candy at Haas' store on the day in O
O question, and that they assert it was packed in a box identical with O
O .that which contained the poisoned candy. If this be so, it sets up O
O the doubt as to whether the candy girls did not confound Mrs. Bot- O
O kin with the Los Angeles lady, and their identification of Mrs. Bot- O
O kin was therefore a mistake and therefore valueless as evidence. These Q
O facts were learned at a late hour to-night and no opportunity to ver- Â©
O ify them can be had until to-morrow* O

duction of one hour in the time between

ANOTHER DAY
FOR BACKERS
OF FAVORITES
Horses Ran to Form
at Oakland.
CODA WAS A REAL SURPRISE
DOWNED A BIG FIELD AT LONG
ODDS.
Ridden to Perfection by Charley-
Gray â It Was Piggott's Day
to Shine â Piloted Three
of the Winners.
Horses that were slow beginners got
very little of the money at Oakland yes
terday. The going was good and bad In
spotn, and the horse that hit the stretch
in front, securing the dry
usually had Its number hoistprt on
top. Early in the day the talent
pronounced the card a hard one to beat,
but such it did not prove to be. Favor
ites annexed four purses and Joe Plggott
made himself popular by piloting three
of the winning horses. Coda, against
which 15 to 1 was laid, escaped with the
last event.
The educated division all backed Cash
S'luari'p, mount, Don Gara, in the opening
six-furlong sprint, getting aboard at 4 to
1. Cash soon had the brown horse in
front and won witii an expansive grin on
his face. Gratify, closing equal favorite
in the ring with the winner, was a handy
second over Grandezia.
In the six-furlong spin that followed
Horatio, with Piggott up, looked to out
class his company, and 7 to 10 seemed a
liberal quotation. He swerved badly
through the stretch, but under forcible
persuasion administered by his rider
eventually landed the purse six lengths
ahead of Sevoy. Paul Kruger, a 100 to 1
shot, took the show.
Tom Ryan tossed Goal Runner back In
the five-furlong scramble next decided,
but he proved a poor repeater. He was
well backed, but was raced to pieces the

LARGEST COURSING STAKE.
Eighty Dogs Will Contest for Eight
Hundred Dollars in Prizes at
Ingleside Park.
Eighty of the best known performers of
the local kennels have been entered for
the open stake which will be run on Sat
urday and Sunday next at Ingleslde
Coursing Park. Weather permitting, the
sport should be of the best, as mere are
several new dogs among the entrants. It
will be noticed that Mr. Curtis of San
Jose has finally concluded that the Ingle
side Park is the better place for dog
owners who are looking for clean snort
to pitch their tent. He has some of his
crack coursers entered for the meeting,
and will doubtless be among the leash
men who will ligure as prize-winners. It
will also be noticed that the kennels of
so-and-so do not figure in the entry list.
The result of the drawing is as follows:
Open stake, eighty entries; prizes. JllO, $75,

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Jan. The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were idle and dull to-day,
Paris realizing at the settlement. It Is pre
paring for the Tonquin loan. There Is also
talk of dearer money.
Americans opened heavy on profit-taking here.
New York bought little and the close was de
pressed, except for Ontario and Western. In
; which there was good buying here and from
New York. The feeling here is that the market
will pause until 1899 prospects seem clearer.
Coppers were dull on the Paris tone.
Money was easy, Â£176.000 gold being taken
for shipment to America and Â£5000 arriving
from Australia. The price has relapsed to 77s
10% d

rate from 6 to 7 per cent.

, commencing to tumble in from outside sources,
I induced, apparently, by the threatened cold
, weather damage to winter wheat and reports
of heavy exports from Atlantic ports. The
foreign buying became so persistent that shorts i
were forced to co\-er. and May was gradually
bid up to 71% c. Liverpool was %d higher and j
receipts were comparatively small. The mar- '
j kct*-held fairly steady until i within half an
hour of the -close, when the buying from the
outside subsided. Then some local speculators
flooded the pit with long wheat" and also sold
for the short account. The market became quite
heavy under this pressure,. and May was forced
down to 70%Â®70%c, and closed at 70% c.
Improvement In the weather, which was fa
: vorable for a large movement in the country,
weakened corn. May lost %c. ,
The decline In the leading grains and a poor
cash demand caused a heavy feeling In oats
Liquidation of lone lines caused a sharp de
cline in prices. May closed He lower. â¢
There was more or less liquidation in pro-
Visions. The market started out handicapped
with enormous hog receipts and a decline in
the coarse grains. Prices were forced off all
around. The demand for products was slow
May pork lost 15c; May lard 10@12ijc, and May
ribs 7%510c. *

ORANGES IN NEW YORK.
NEW YORK, Jan. The Journal of Com
merce says: The unsettled condition of the
orange market during December, as the result
of liberal receipts, particularly of California
fruit, has been somewhat accentuated as the
result of the falling off of the consuming de
mand following the holidays. Receipts of all ;
descriptions for the season to date .have been i
much In excess of those for the corresponding ,
period last year. The consuming demand, on j
the other hand, has been much better than It j
was a year ago, and supplies have gone out 1
quite freely into consumption, leaving In first â 
hands comparatively small stocks. Jamaica?. (
which monopolized attention at the beginning ,
of the season and until California* began to ,
come forward In liberal quantity, have been
relegated to the background, the demand for ,
consumers of late having been chiefly for the |
last named. The Florida crop, having been |
larger than for a number of years past, has
been quite an Important factor In the situa- ,
tion, having assisted materially In preventing
an Improvement in quotations on other descrip
tions.
The quantity of California oranges offered at
auction BO far this season has amounted to
104 cars, the bulk of which was disposed of â 
within the past couple of weeks. j
While early arrivals of California oranges
were said to show a large percentage of im
mature fruit owing to tne anxiety of grow- |
ers to get their stock to market in time for
the holiday trade in the East, later receipts,
partclularly those of the past week, have been
all that could be desired, it would appear from
statements of prominent handlers at this end.
The rush of arrivals which for several weeks
past has had a demoralizing Influence on the )
market, is over for the time being. Accord- 1
ing to telegraphic advices from primary ship- |
ping centers unfavorable weather, coupled with
the usual slacking up of packing operations
during the holiday season causing light ship
ments, for the next ten days or two weeks
receipts here are expected to be small. Valen
cia oranges have been a very unimportant fac- j
tor In this market, though receipts have been j
considerably In excess of those of last year â
10,000 cases against 3000 cases. The quality of
the fruit does not seem to have suited buy
ers, and with more desirable stock to choosa ;
from at comparatively low prices they have I
neglected Valencias.

ANNA LICHTER WILL
STAY AT THE TIVOLI
SIGNED A TREATY OF PEACE
WITH THE MANAGEMENT.
She Had Been Dismissed for Failing
to Appear at a Late
Rehearsal.
Friends of Anna Lichter, the popular
r at the Tlvoli, will be pleased to
know that a change has been made and
?lio will stay In this city for the present.
The trouble with Miss Lichter arose
over her refusal to attend a late rehearsal
of th<- "Yellow Dwarf." She was given
the customary two weeks' notice and de
i she was not a bit sorry. Monday
evening her place was filled by Miss
Ellen Merrill, who went through the
part creditably, although handicapped
with a severe cold. Tuesday found Miss
RfefrilJ confined to her home with the
grippe", and the management of the house
was In despair. Miss Llchter heard of the
difficulties and went down and volunteered
her services. Needless to say they were !
thankfully accepted, and the result is that
the hatchet has been formally burled by
the signing of a new contract, and peace
once more reigns in the little opera house.
THE OLD EXEMPTS.
Reunion of Firemen at the Banquet
Table.
There was a gala time last night in the
hall of the Exempts on Brenham place,
for within the walls there was a reunion
of those brave men of the old volunteer
fire department who have passed into
the sere and yellow leaf of life and are
patiently awaiting the time when they
shall be summoned to answer the hist
rollcall. It was the installation of the of
ficers who were elected for the current
year, and those who were Inducted into
offic e are:
President, George T. Bohen; -vice presi
dent. Andrew J. Jessup; secretary, J. J.
Guilfoyle; treasurer, J. W. Kentzel; ex
ecutive committeeâ Henry A. Chase, D.
A. Ftan. Godfrey Fisher. Jacob Freeman,
James Grady. Washington Irving, J. J.
Mahoney, Charles B. McFarland. James
O'Donnell. Frank Richards: d: fetors-
Joseph Figel, G. J. Hobe. William Ryck
mann II D. Xudron. Joseph S. Marshall.
In addition to the few members who are
still on the roll nf the company there
were several invited guests, notably
among them, Mayor Phelan, George T.
Bromley, ex-Judge Robert Ferral. Dr.
Dotkin and several of the city officials.
After the ceremony of Installation there
was a banquet served in the upper hall,
and aft.r what h;ul been provided had
been disposed of there was a number of
toasts suitable responses and songs that
the old boys used to sing when manning
the brakes in their valiant efforts to con
quer the demon, tire. In a review of the
volunteer firemen, ex-Judge Ferral said
that at the time the volunteer fire depart
m.nt was disbanded there were 1291
names on the roll, and that many of those
had been In the department for ten years,
during all of which they worked without
pay. Of this number 12 0 w< re enrolled
mi the books of the Exempt Company,
but there are now only 300 living and only
S9 on the Exempt's roll.
During the past three years death has
taken from the ranks of the volunteers
an average of sixteen a year, and, as
many are now in the seventies and a few
in the eighties, it Is fair to presume that
as the death rate increases the time will
not be far distant when the association
will ceaae to exist. There are now sixty
eight old veterans who are receiving a
small monthly pension out of the J
a year allowed by the Supervisors., but
of that number fifty-three are not mem
bers of th<> company. Since the organi
zation of the volunteer department Up to
the present time the charitable fund has
disbursed $400,000 for the ear.- of si. k fire
men, contributions to widows and or
phans and in the placing at rest in the
in's plat those who bad p
away. The speaker then paid a most
glowing tribute to the worth of the men
of the day! of old who risked life and
limb to protect the lives and property of

THE SAN FBAIS T CTSCO CALL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 6, 1899.
CORPORATION
FERRY BOUTS
IN HARD LUCK
Three of Them Now
Being Repaired.
A SERIES OF BREAKDOWNS
TWO FAST OCEAN VOYAGES OUT
OF THIS PORT.
The lllawara Went in 48 Days to
Sydney and the Cyrus Wake
field in 100 Days to
New York.
The Southern Pacific ferry boats are
playing in hard luck. Over on the Oakland
side of the bay they are fixing .up the
seawall, and Wednesday one of the big
stones got too much impetus and rolled
into the ferry slip. In consequence there
was not enough water for the Berkeley,
so she had to land her passengers at the
seawall and lay up for a few trips until
the stone was removed.
In the meantime the steamer El Cf.pi
tan was put on in the Berkeley's place,
and for a few trips she succeeded in en
tering and leaving the slip all right. In
an unlucky moment, however, her paddle
wheel came in contact with the rock and
as a result her shaft broke and she had
to be retired. Half an hour later the
rock was removed and the Berkeley re
sumed her trips.
During the southeaster of last Sunday
the Oakland broke her rudder so tnat the
Southern Pacific now has undergoing re
pairs the Bay City, El Oapitan and Oak
land. Should another one of the fleet
break down there will be a shortness of
boats, and the commuters will have a
lively time getting to and from Oakland.
Unlicensed masters and mates of United
States vessels of 700 tons and over will
have to do some studying between now
and July. On December 21 last an act
was approved which makes a license
compulsory, and yesterday Gardner &
Thornier, the Custom-house brokers, re
ceived word from Washington which says
the law goes into effect on July 1. It will
affect over 250 masters and mates on this j
coast alone, as all of them will have to !
pass an examination In navigation before j
they can go out as master or mate of a I
700-ton vessel again.
â¢ The fastest trip made in years between
here and Sydney, N. S. W., by a sailing
vessel is the forty-eight day run of the
British ship Illawara. She left here on
November 14 last with a general cargo
and 9482 centals of barley valued at $13,- ,
000 and 13,230 barrels of flour valued at :
$62,200. She arrived in Port Jackson on !
New Year's eve. The record between
here and Sydney is held by the American ;
ship Snow and Burcess, which made the
run in forty-four days a number of years
ago.
Another very fast run was that of the
American ship Cyrus Wakeneld. She sail
ed from here on September 27 and arrived
at New York yesterday. While making
port she struck on a rock, but floated off
without injury at high tide. When last
here the Wakefleld was purchased by
John Rosenfeld's Sons and she now flies
the house flag of that well-known firm.
Captain E. L. Murphy died at Portland ,
yesterday. He was master of the Ameri
can ship George Stetson, but was daily
expected In San Francisco to take com- |
mand of the big four-masted Shenandoali.
He was not so well known here as his i
brother, the former master of the Shenan
doah, but nevertheless he leaves a host
of friends wno will mourn his sudden
taking off. -- V â¢,' r<: - :
As the steamer Acapulco was being
towed to her slip at the Pacific Mail dock
last night she ran afoul of the steamer
China and did considerable damage. The
rear lifeboat on the China was torn from
its davits and smashed between the j
two vessels. Considerable paint was
scratched from the sides of both vessels,
and at first it was thought that some of j
the China's plates had been damaged, but :
an examination failed to reveal any in
jury. The Acapulco had been at the dry
dock and was being towed in by Captain
Driscoll on the Mlllen Griffith. The ac
cident was due to the strong ebb tide
{lowing at the time.

witness is Lizzie Murphy, who a 11.:., a
that she had been employed in Schaffer's
store on Market street for the past six
weeks. Yesterday morning a counterfeit
half-dollar was taken In and Sehaffer ac
cused her of doing it. She denied having
accepted it and Schaffer discharged her.
She asked fur a recommendation, but he
declined and demanded the key of the
â tore from her. This she refused and
Schaffer grabbed her by the throat. She
screamed and he allowed her to go. She
returned later and Schaffer agreed to give
her a recommendation if she would go
with him to his store on Sixth street.
They went there and Schaffer again de
manded the key, but was firmly told "no
recommendation no key." Schaffer be
came exasperated and threw her out of
the store.
CYCLERS WILL MEET.
Association to Consider Important
Amendments To-Morrow Night.
The first regular meeting of the new
board of officers of the Associated Cycling
Clubs will be held to-morrow evening in
the rooms of the Cycle Board of Trade,
Parrott building. President Nippert will
preside and the following important
amendments to the constitution, which
were presented at the last meeting, will
come up for consideration:
Introduced by Scovernâ Creating an addi
tional iroctlon to article 2 of the constitution to
be known as section 12, as follows: "In all
annual events promoted by the association
other than club team events, all contestants
must lip members in good standing on the In
dividual membership list, otherwise they will
not be entitled tv ride In such events."
Introduced by GamesâT hat all amateur
members of the association may and shall be
entitled to compete In all races (whether open
or Inter-club events) held under the rules and
regulations of the C. A. C. C, and further, that
all rules and laws In conflict with this por
vlsion are hereby repealed.
Both of these amendments are aimed
at the same target, namely, to require all
competitors in association events to be
members of the C. A. C. C, but in the
Scovern resolution "other than club team
events" means the omission of the relay
and twenty-mile events from this pro
vision. There may be a contest.
The big race meet at San Jose, which
had to be postponed on New Year's day
owing to rain, will be held next Sunday,
January 8. weather permitting. As the
roads are too muddy to assure good rid
ing, most of the contingent from this city
will go down on the 9 a. m. train Sunday
morning.
The final game of the Cycle Clubs' Base
ball League will be played at the Velo
drome Sunday, January 15, between the
Bay Citys and Olympics.
T. A. Griffiths, the well-known racer of
the Bay City Wheelmen, has just return
ed from the Hawaiian Islands. Kenneth
Melrose and Ivan Treadwell of the same
club will leave fur Honolulu on a pleasure
trip January 11.
OFFICEHOLDERS ON
THE ANXIOUS SEAT
THE RECOUNT BEGINS BEFORE
JUDGE HEBBARD.
Contestant Doolan Loses During the
i>ay â Rumors That Glaring Mis
counts Had Been Discovered.
Many office holders are on the anxious
seat. That "mistakes" were made in the
counting of the ballots has been proved,
but to what extent no one at present
knows. The fact that "mistakes" were
made was brought to light yesterday dur
ing the count of ballots cast in the Twen
ty-ei-hth District, the count being in the
contested election of Martin F. Fragley
on behalf of R. P. Doolan, who met de
feat as a candidate for the office of Su
perintendent of Streets.
The matter of the recount was taken
up by Judge Hebbard at the opening of
the morning session. Fragley's counsel
moved for a dismissal, which Judge Heb
bard denied, and then ordered the re
count to begin. Registrar Biggy produced
the ballots of the Twenty-eighth District
and work proceeded. Snap tallyists in
numbers hovered round the counting ta
bles. Judge Low was present sizing up
matters. Dr. C. C. O'Donnell, defeated
condidate for Coroner, was represented.
as were Supervisor Byington and Judge
Wallace. Ai the close of the day's count
it was announced that Fragley had gained
four votes ;md lost one. Doolan gained
two votes and lost four, leaving Fragley
a balance of five votes gain. It was ru
mored among the snap tallyists that May
or Phelan liud gained twenty votes In
the Third Preceinct of the Twenty-eighth
District; that Maher had gained fifteen
District Attorney Murphy had lost
fifteen. These rumors could not be veri
fied, however, but the alarmists enjoyed
thn occasion. The count will go on to
day.
POISON OR GASTRITIS
FROM OVER-EATING
THE DEMISE OF PETER JACOB
SON TO BE INVESTIGATED.
Autopsy Failed to Show the Cause of
Death â The Stomach Will Be
Analyzed by the Coroner.
Peter Elmer Jacobson, a 10-year-old boy,
â whose parents reside at 143(5 Howard
street, died yesterday under circum
stances which make an inquest necessary.
Dr. P. A. Kearney was called in by the
boy's parents at 5 o'clock on Wednesday
afternoon, and found him suffering with
pains as though from an injury. He
learned that the boy had hurt himself
while playing in the yard.
At 9 o'clock, when the doctor called
again, he found the boy in a dying condi
tion. The boy had eaten some walnuts
shortly before he had been taken sick,
and It Was believed that he was Buffering
from some form of poisoning, but there
w< re no indications of poison save the
pains In the stomach.
Dr. Zabala performed an autopsy on the
body last evening and was unable to as
certain the cause of death. There was no
indication <>!' any injury whatever. Ine
stomach wat; reserved for the chemist,
who Will analyze the contents to-day.
Dr. Kearne 1 was Been last night, and
said he thought there was nothing suspi
cious in the ease. It is his belief that
deatn might have been due to extreme
gastritis. The mother says the boy had
eaten a number of the walnuts which she
admits were not fresh. I'r.1 'r. Kearney is of
th.- ..pinion that the boy gorged himself
With the moldy nuts and brought about
inflammation of the stomach.

OPENING OF THE
GRAECO-RUSSIAN
CHRISTMASTIDE
Vesper Services in the
Cathedral.
BISHOP TIKEHON OFFICIATES
CZARS RELIGIOUS REPRESEN
TATIVE BLESSES HIS FLOCK.
Morning and Evening Programme to
Commemorate the Anniversary
of Christ's Birth Arranged
for To-Day.
To-day is the anniversary of the birth
of the Savior, according to the teachings
of the Graeco-Russlan church, and as such
will be commemorated In a tltting manner
by the followers of that faith in this city.
Special Christmas vesper services were
celebrated in the Russian Cathedral on
Powell street, near Filbert, last night by
Bishop Tikehon, who recently arrived in
San Francisco to succeed Bishop Nicholas.
The Bishop and attendant priests were
arrayed in their full robes of office, that of
the Bishop being purple, and the effect'
produced when the head of the church
in this section of the world appeared from
behind the gorgeous screenlike partition
at the head of his richly attired assist
ants and marched down the center of the
room to the little raised platform, which
served as an altar, was very impressive.
Arriving at the altar the priests grouped
themselves about tho Czar's spiritual rep
resentative, chanting a prayer, at the
conclusion of which priests and congre
gation knelt while the Bishop blessed
them in the name of Christ. This sol
emn proceeding formally inaugurated the
services, which were of considerable
length.
The atmosphere was heavy with burn
ing incense, and the singing of the choir,
the solemn chanting of the priests, com
bined with the pictures of martyrs and
scriptural quotations which adorned the
walls of the cathedral, produced a strange
feeling of mingled awe and curiosity to
the uninitiated stranger.
At the conclusion of the services tho
Bishop pronounced a benediction and dis
missed the congregation.
Special Christmas services will be held
at 10 o'clock this morning and at 7 in the
evening.
The congregation of the Gracco-Rus
sian church in this city Includes Russians,
Slavonians, Croations and Greeks, a few
Roumanians and a scattering of other
nationalities or races.
THE SECOND
ROSENTHAL
RECITAL
Mozart, Chopin, Brahms and Rosen
thai were the composers represented in
Mr. Rosenthal's recital at the Metropol
itan Temple last night. Not as sensa
tional a programme as that of Tuesday
night, but one stocked with valuable
literature of the instrument; and, al
most needless to write, amazingly
played. Again Mr. Rosenthal vindi
cated the heaps of adulatory adjectives
that have beset his Western pathway;
his second San Francisco audience was
as dazzled as the first had been, and
the night was a glad triumph. He com
menced with the Mozart sonata in A
major, and played it in the true Mo
zart way, delicately, fragrantly, with
bouyant appreciation of Its melodic
charms and without the lugging in of
any false dramaisms. Then he played
the B flat minor sonata of Chopin with
vast sonority; at times the effect w;is
almost orchestral. No one who heard
this interpretation will soon forget it.
It was less emotional than Paderew
ski's, it had less of the human sob in
the major strains of the funeral march
and less celebration of the futility of
hope in that awful, soul-racking pres
to; it was, indeed, a healthier and less
harrowing version that the Pole's; but
it was terribly in earnest, a dignified,
virile, masterly conception. The Chopin
etude, the one whose specialty is
octaves (I forgot the key and number),
he gave delightful clarity and freedom,
and the A flat major waltz with almost
ingenuous fluency. Each of these pieces
stormed the audience and was repeated.
The Brahms variations on a I'aganini
theme and Rosenthal's own "Vienna
Carnival" on themes by Johann Strauss
were the technical sensationsâ the one
delivered with fine elucidation of the
underlying seriousness, the other whirl-
Ing, spinning, rushing and twisting in
the sheerest bravoura, and both the
summit of pianistic technique. A brace
of compositions, "Romanze" and "Pa
pillons," displayed the simple, melodic
and very catchy creative gift of the
player. I hope that Mr. Rosenthal will
include some more of nis own work in
the concerts to come. Besides to-mor
row's matinee he plays Sunday night
and Tuesday afternoon.

guage, which Clyde resented by striking
him on the face.

A Hunt for a Missing ./ord.
A North Carolina preacher, in one of
our western counties, whose memory
sometimes falls him at the critical point,
was recently preaching a sermon before
a Sunday school convention. His subject
was "The Resurrection." The thought
toward which he was driving with all
physical earnestness was that the doc
trine of the resurrection was the very es
sence of the Gospel. The word "essence"
he had carefully calculated to use In a
tremendous epitome of his whole thought.
Rising on tiptoe, he shouted: "In a nut
shell, my brethren, the doctrine of the
resurrection Is the veryâ is the very"â
Alas! his chosen word "essence" was
gone. He paused a second and then
strode forward and shouted in thunder
tones: "The doctrine of the resurrection
is the veryâ is the very" â . The recalcit
rant was again nowhere in sight. Paus
ing once more, and mustering his physi
cal weapons for a final desperate en
deavor, he lowered his voice, but with
intense earnestness, as If angry with poor
absent "essence." he again let drive:
"Brethren, the thought I have tried to
impress upon you Is that the doctrine of
the resurrection is the veryâ is the veryâ
is the very soup of the Gospel!"âHomi
letic Review.
CLEVER TRENCH SWINDLERS.
An Ingenious Trick That Was
Worked for Months Without
IMscovery.
People are talking a good deal to-day
about the capture of a gang of clever
swindlers, called "la bande dcs aristos,"
as it was composed of individuals of gen
tlemanly appearance, who kept to them
selves, had no dealings with other and
less preten tious groups of the same char
acter, and worked on a very ambitious
scale. These men, who treated themselves
without stint to titles, and who professed
to be very wealthy, took note in their
headquarters in this city of estates which
were for sale in the provinces, and, after
obtaining complete information as to the
idiosyncracies of their intended victims
started bold on their campaign. One or
them called, as if by the mereest chance,
to look at the pronerty in question, ex
plaining that he thought that it would
just suit a friend, who might wish to run
down there now and then. An appoint
ment was made, and in the course of a
few days an accomplice appeared, in com
pany with the original visitor, and was
introduced as the likely purchaser.
The bargain was discussed over a good
dejeuner, and then it was suggested by one
of the strangers that so many thousand
francs should be put down as a guaran
tee in the event of the buyer eventually
changing his mind, a like sum being de
posited by the seller, who would also for
feit it if he determined after all on re
taining the house and grounds. In not a
few cases the proposition was gladly ac
cepted, the money was placed by the own
er of the estate in a cash box, which, in
Its turn, was closed in a small portman
teau, which one of the visitors volun
teered to leave with him, and which was
specially arranged for the trick. The
strangers then bade their host farewell,
and with many protestations of friend
ship, but as they were leaving the house
the owner of the portmanteau suddenly
remembered that he needed some article
of clothing which it contained. The key
was handed to him by the proprietor, the
object mentioned removed, and at last
they were off for good'and all.
When the fortnight, which had boon
agreed upon as the interval during which
the arrangement must be duly ratified,
had rolled by, the would-be seller opened
the cash box to llnd, to his horror, that
It was full Â©f worthless paper. It was not
his own, but another like it, and he had
been deceived by the resemblance.
Extraordinary to relate, this Ingenious
band had worked for months without once
being baffled, the money of which it
contrived to possess itself being esimated
at upward of Â£80.000. The ringleader, a
man about 33 years of age, had provided
himself with a rare show of French and
foreign aliases, and with a marvelous ar
ray of titles to boot. He is accused of
having appropriated through these nefarl
lous transactions sums varying from 3000
to over 100,000 francs, and at his above
divers tools used for the manufacture of
thn wonderful valises have been discov
ered. Another, who is also charged with
h;: .iiiK enriched himself under similar
conditions, had a fair amount of capital
deposited in two banks. Six members of
the gang, and a woman who lived with
one of them, are now secure under lock
and key, and the police officials are be
ing warmly congratulated on their cap
ture, which has been effected after a long
and patient investigation.â Paris Corre

Slavonic Patronymics.
The patronymics of the Slavonic races
(pff, evich, nvich. In, Ich) are too w^li
known to need comment, hut It Is worth
noting 1 , as a curiosity, that the Little
Russian or Ruthenian has an ending of
Its own, enko, as In the surnames Nikit
enko, Yefimenko, ?on of Nlcetas, son of
Euthymus. Of the other nationalities
under the dominion of Russia the Geor
gian has two terminations, shvili and
dze, both mc-anlngr son.
"When the names became Russified,"
says Thielmann, "the termination shvili
Is generally changed into eff or off. An
exception is found to this rule in the case
of the Rapratidzp, the most distinguished
family in the land, which calls Itself Bag
ration." An Instance of the change above
referred to is the name of Ratioff, in
Georgian Ratieshvill; while as to Bagra
tlon, I do not know its origin, but it re
minds one of the Armenian patronymics
with their monotonous ending, ian, ex
amples of which are common ambong the
Armenian residents in London â Hagopian
(Jacobson), Krlkorian (son of Gregory),
Findjanjian (son of the coffee-cup maker),

VERY MUCH OF A JOKER
SACRAMENTO VISIT MADE HIM
CHAPLAIN.
He Is Surprised at the Manner in
Which He Beat Rev. C.
Oehler in the
Caucus.
Oakland OffW Ran Francisco Call,
Broadway, Jan. 5.
Rpv. Barton W. Perry, chaplain of the
nobly, was called to Oakland last
â niKht to attend to an Important duty In
idro and while In Oakland he
ted an Interesting story regarding his
.-nomination for chaplain by the Republl
caucus.
1 >r. Ferry's chief opponent was Rev.
< i tehler of Sacramento, whose claim
â  was based on the fact that he had per
.l the spiritual duty for the last
mbly. Mr. Oehler is evidently not as
. politic a divine aa his rival from San
] Tidro. He was s.i confident that he
. Woul ; himself that he neglected
sual precautions and came down to
â¢ the caucus ai Sacramento only to find
that of the fifty-four votes in the caucus
venteen.
"It was very funny." said Dr. Perry,
"and although 1 feel sorry for Mr. Oehler
1 consider that I won out fairly. You
Â«cc, .; was this way. The Alameda dele
gation was determined to secure the po
sition for me. Of course a minister can
do politics and neither of us under

caucus adjourned I was talk
ing to a reporter when a gentleman came
up and Bald, 'Have you seen a minister
named Perry around here." 1 tojd him I
was the man. 'Well 1 am sorry for you,
Mr Oehler, 'for it is all fixed up
and you are not in it.' 'Can you lend me
the fare to get back to San Leandroi I
asked. 'With pleasure." said Mr. oehler,
and he was digging down in his pocket
for the $2 50 when Assemblyman Know
land came out of the committee-room i
and putting his hand on my shoulder said.
"It's all right. Perry; the thing's done and
you have the |ob.' Oehler looked on in,
Burprtse and I returned the compliment i
sking him if he would like to borrow :
a nickel on which to ride home.
"I understand that some of the Alame
da delegation did some very clever trad
ing in my behalf, but that is, I am told,
common In politics, although, of course,
1 understand nothing about it myself.
The people of San Leandro. where Dr.
Perry is very popular, feel gratified that

also prays that the- decree may be modi- \
o that the entire amount of $25 per ;

CITY COMMITTEE CONVENES
MEMBERS FAVOR A SHORT
CITY CAMPAIGN.
The Majority Is Said to Be Desirous
of Calling a Convention
by the Appointive
Method.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 5.
The Republican City Central Commit
! tee will decide the important question as
to how the convention shall be called
i next Tuesday. It is apparent that at
present there is a leaning of a majority
of the committee toward the appointive
plan rather than toward primaries.
At the meeting of the committee an
: important letter was read showing that
' the appointive plan is not recognized as
truly Republican by President McKin
ley The letter was written in March,
' 15*6. to an Oakland Republican, and is
j as follows:
1 My Dear Sir: Last night a dispatch came
I from California to the effect that tho St. it-
Central Committee of that State had turned
over to the district committees of the various
j Congressional districts the riÂ£ht to appoint all
! the delegates to the St. Louie convention and
. al.^.j to the State convention, which will elect
! the four delegates at. larft.
It was represented in this telegram that there
was greet indignation on the part 01 the Re
! publican masses of California, for the reason
that it practically Rave the people no voice In
the selection of delegates, and the right to vote
for delegates is Just as sacred as the right to
vote for Presidential Electors. Already there
are inquiries in regard to this action, for if
puch a course be taken a deadly blow will be
struck at McKinley*s chance? in California,
unless the Republicans of that State make
themselves felt. 1 am. yours very truly.
JAMES BOYLE, Private Secretary.
Several of the committeemen were of
the opinion that while it might be the
better plan to elect delegates to State
conventions and national conventions at
primaries, it did not follow that such a
course is best for a municipal camp;ugn.
Chairman Williams is anxious fur a
short campaign, and aa the date of the
election is March 13, he favored holding
the convention not more than two weeks
prior to that time. Several other members
favor holding the convention as early
us the latter part of this month, but a
majority is clearly anxious for a late
convention and a short campaign.
DEPOSIT REQUIRED OF
STREET RAILWAY MEN
MOTORMAN HUNTER LOSES ON
APPEAL.
Significant Decision as to the Liabil
ity of Employes' Casualty
Deposits.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, Jan. 5.
A case of much significance, to street
railway employes and touching upon the
question of the right of a corporation to
require of its employes a deposit of $25
and other indemnity against loss through
damages was decided by Superior Judge
Ellsworth this afternoon.
The case was that of R. H. Hunter
against the Oakland Transit Company for
the recovery of a deposit of $25 which
plaintiff, a motorman, had ben required
to put up before assuming his duties as an
employes. The case was before Judge
Ellsworth on appeal from a judgment
rendered by Justice of the Peace Wood
In favor of defendant.
According to the testimony a collision
occurred at the curve at East Eleventh
street and Eighth avenue, where the rules
require all cars to be flagged, which
rule was neglected. A passenger sus
tained injuries on Hunter's car and was
given damages in a small amount.
Subsequently Hunter was discharged,
when, to his financial sorrow, he was re
fused the refunding <>t his $25 deposit,
which had been paid out to cover the pas
senger's damage. To recover this deposit
Hunter sued.
It was shown that as a necessary ad
junct to the deposit was a contract,
signed by the plaintiff, and specifying the
indemnifying character of the deposit.
Judge Ellsworth held that the plaintiff
had been guilty of negligence in continu
ing around the curve with his car with
out being flagged and inferentially decid
ed that the contract between the motor
man and defendant corporation was valid
and binding and the deposit liable.
The court gave judgment for defendant
and costs.
Determined that the highest legal tri
bunal shall finally decide the. question
at issue Hunter states that he will appeal
the case to the State Supreme Court.

WILL NOT PAY ALIMONY.
Captain Yon Schmidt Says He Pre
fers to Go to Jail.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 5. â Captain yon
Schmidt, whose wife secured a divorce
from him yesterday and also the custody
of their five minor children, vows that
he will not pay his wife a cent of alimony.
The captain was perfectly willing to pro
vide for the maintenance of tho children
if he had their custody, but he is averse
to allowing his ex-wife to handle any of
his money. He stated at the time the
divorce proceedings were commenced that
all that worried him was the fate of the
children and intimated that their mother
was not a proper person, in his opinion,
to rear them.
"I shall light against paying alimony,
and shall endeavor to secure the custody
of the children," he said at the time; "but
If by some misfortune the court should
award my wife alimony I will never pay
it. All that they can do to me is to send
me to jail if 1 refuse to pay, and that is
what I propose to let them do."
The court ordered the captain to pay
his wife $75 a month, and the outcome of
the decree is awaited with much interest
by the friends of both Mr. and Mrs. yon
Schmidt.
HAD BUT ONE PIECE
OF POLITICAL PIE
THE ALAMEDA TRUSTEES WERE
NEARLY BUNKOED.
A Politician Tries to Work a Gold
Brick on Them in the Appoint
ment of Police Officers.
ALAMEDA, Jan. s.â Local politicians
and the circle in which they revolve are
humming to-day over the unceremonious
manner in which the City r J rustees
turned down Frank Hackett, when tney
went through the performance last even
ing of appointing four new members of
the Police Department. Hackett was not
even given the satisfaction of being men
tioned, although he had filed a petition
with several yards of signatures and had
stated with all earnestness that he had
four of the Trustees tied up to him a- .
was as good as appointed before the City
Fathers held the;r meeting. And Hackett
was not joking when he made these state
ments, ile has figured in politics in Ala
meda even before he was able to vote,
and has been looked upon as a second
edition of Sam Rainey. lie was active In
Supervisor Church's tight, and is cred
ited with carrying the end of Alameda
that saved the Supervisor's political life.
After this heroic act Hackett thought it
whs time for him to look around lor some
! thing tor himself, and he selected a com
i fuituble berth in the Police Department.
He felt It in his bones that all he would
have to do to secure the position was to
ask for it, consequently his astonishment
last evening when he was not even men
tioned can be better imagined than de
scribed. As a matter of fitet Hackett aid
nave the position promised to un at one
stage of tne contest. When the police oill
cer bee began to buzz in his oonnet ne
sought Trustee Brick, who is chairman
of tne Police Committee. -Mr. Brick was
nominated and elected for the office he
holds by what is known in local politics
a.s the iiarmonie Hall party. Feeling mat
!he owed his party some consideration
l when he suggested an appointment on
] the police force, Mr. Brick advised Hack
i ett that if he secured the indorsement of
I the Harmonic Hall executive committee
! he would recommend him for the position.
Hackett did as directed, and secured the
: signatures of all the members on hid peti
tion. On the strength of this Brick prom
i ised him the job. The other members of
the City Trustees agreed to abide by the
I recommendation of the chairman of the
Police Committee. This was two weena
1 ago, and had the appointment been made
at that time Hackett would have come
: out on top, but the Harmonic Hall people
heard that he had presented them with <
i gold brick, and Mr. Brick delayed the
'< appointment until he could look into the
i matter. Hackett impressed, the Harmonic
1 Hall people with the idea that he was one
' of their stanchest supporters. Of course
i their pie was only for the faithful, and
! consequently they backed Hackett up.
i bat^r it developed that the aspirant for
police honors was not a Harmonieite by
any manner of means, but instead had
been most violent and bitter in his fight
against the nominees of that party at
i the last city election. This information
'' reached headquarters just in the nick of
! time and Brick and his colleagues are
I congratulating themselves that an arch
enemy did not get away with the only
piece of pie they had to deal out to tue
J. B Hadley received the appointment.
I while Homer Faris, George Smith and
William Wcymouth were placed on tae
force on probation and without pay.
Weeks Has Changed His Mind.
ALAMEDA, Jan. s.â Since The Call has
made public the fact thai Editor Weeks
of the Alameda Kncinal was about to re
tire from tne active management ot the
paper in favor of Edward Nauman. busi
ness manager, the gentleman has changed
his mind and his plans. In a published
Statement he emphatically denies that be
will quit, and he states that he has given
up the idea of going to the Klondike. Last
week Mr. Weeks offered to lease his pa
per and plant for $60 a month. A gentle
i man connected with the Encinal office
stated to a Call renorter yesterday that
the rumor that Mr. Weeks was about to

THE VALUE OF
A COURTROOM
OF OLD JUNK
Judge Quinn Objects
to Precedent.
EVEN TWO HUNDRED ASKED
FIGURES UNALTERED FOR
TWENTY YEARS.
Justice Clift Cannot Strike a Bar
gain, and Justice Is Therefore
Dispensed in a Small
Store.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. Jan. 5.
Justice Quinn and ex-Justice CUft can
not agree regarding the value of several
ancient chairs, an antique stove and sev
eral yards of freely punctured matting â
the whole constituting the furnishing of
the courtroom of Oakland Township.
There is a precedent in the case, which
precedent Justice Clift values at $200,
whereas his successor from Emeryville
believes he could procure equally ancient
furnishing for one-tenth of the amount
named. As a result of this contention
ex-Justice Clift has a courtroom on his
hands, but no license to hold court; Jus
tice Quinn has rented a store on Broad
way, but it has no furnishing, and to-day
he transacted his business in the office of
Justice Stetson, across the street.
This unpleasantness may last for a
month, for Justice Clift will not go near
Justice Quinn and Quinn will not ap
proach Clift, and without some one tak
ing the initiative they will hardly ever
.come together. Very many years ago
Judge Nusbaumer furnished the suite of
rooms for the Justice's court. He used
them for a few terms, and when he was
succeeded by Judge Snook he was paid
$200 for the office fixings. Judge Snook
used them for six years, and when he was
promoted to the district attorneyship he
was paid $200 for what was not worn out
of the furnishings by Justice Clift. Six
years have passed since then, and it can
be truthfully be said that the holey mat
ting, scratched chairs and flexible parti
tions show the result of nearly twenty
years of hard wear. However, Justice
Clift, following the $200 precedent, paid
rent for the month of January, fully ex
pecting that his successor would follow
the example which has become all but a
statute.
"When Judge Quinn, fresh from the sec
tion of the old Sunday-school of Emery
ville, which he used as a courtroom,
came to Oakland and saw his predeces
sor's court, he nearly had a fit, which fit
attacked him when he \v;is informed that
$200 was the price of the unhandsome
tilings.
"Justice Quinn will not come to see
me," said Justice Clift, to-day, "so we
cannot adjust matters."
"Justice Clift will not come to see me,"
said Justice Quinn, to-day, "so we cannot
adjust matters. Hr> has rented the court
till February 1, on which date I shall take
it the same as any other tenant and fur
nish it myself."
And in the meantime the new Judge
from Emeryville will dispense justice in a
little store "on Broadway.

BERKELEY, Jan. s.â Abal Raust of
Alcatraz avenue received news last night

sided for the last nine years previous to
going to the Klondike last spring. Besides
his brother in Lorin, he leaves another
brother in rircle City and two sisters.

ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
A COPPER CENTâ Subscriber, City. A
copper cent. United States mintage, dated
IT'.t^. is not a premium coin. Such can be
obtained from dealers for 25 cents apiece.
PAYMASTER IN THE ARMY-8., 173
Haywards, Cal. Paymasters in the Uni
ted States army receive their appoint
ments through the War Department.
LEGAL HOLlDAYâ Subscriber, San
Jose, Cal. The law of California provides
that when a holiday falls on a Sunday
the succeeding day shall be the legal hol
iday.
NO NATIONAL AIRâ A Sailor, U. S.
S. Baltimore. Manila, P. I. "The Star
spangled Banner" is recognized the world
over as an American anthem, but it never
was made such by any act of Congress.
IN THE SPANISH LANGUAGEâ J. A.
R., Crockett, Cal. In the list of papers
published in San Francisco are the fol
lowing which arc published in the Span
ish language: La Opinion Publica and
El Comercio.
A GERMANâ E. 8., City. A man born
in Germany who in due time becomes a
citizen of the United States is a German
by nationality and an American by nat
uralization, and he could call himself a
German-American.
PLAYING CARDSâ Mrs. F., City. This
department is not aware of any concern
that makes a specialty of renovating
playing cards, and if it did it could not
advertise the same, as this department
does not advertise any business or pro
fession.
STATUS OF WOMEN AND ALIENSâ
Politicus Legally. City. In the State of
California neither a woman, an alien
nor one with first papers has a vote. The
right of suffrage is denied to women, but
an alien who has become naturalized can
vote after he has obtained his second
papers and not before. In some States
aliens who have declared their intention
to become citizens are permitted to vote.
SPRING VALLEY DTVIDENrx 3âSub
scriber, Colfax, Placer County. The
Spring Valley Water Company of San
Francisco paid twelve dividends in 1807
and eleven in 189S, the one for September
tor that year being passed.
REPRESENTATIVES FROM CALI
FORNlAâSubscriber, City. The Repre
sentatives from California in the present
session of Congress are: John A. Bar
ham, Marion De Vries, Samuel G. Hllborn,
James G. Maguire, Eugene F. Loud,
Charles A. Barlow and Curtis H. Castle.
COALING STATIONâ An Old Vet.,
Oakland, Cal. If you are ambitious and
want to "go to Pago-Pago to take charge
of the coaling station there." you will
have to file an application at the Navy
Department and then use influence to se
cure the appointment, that is if you have
sufficient and powerful enough influence.
TRESPASSâ W. S., Occidental, Sonoma
County, (al. How far a person may enter
upon lands belonging to another for the
purpose of pursuing wounded game is one
of those questions that cannot be an
swered without a full knowledge of the
facts of each individual case. In some
cases it would be a trespass and in others
it would not be.
MOTHER OF INVENTION-W. J. H.,
City. While it is proper to say "necessity
Is the mother of invention," it would also
be proper to say "necessity is the mother
of compulsion." The want of something
needed will cause a person to invent
something to serve the purpose, and the
necessity to provide food for the family
may compel an individual otherwise in
clined to devise some means to procure it.
THE EIGHTEENTH INFANTRYâ A.
G., Ukiah, Cal. If you desire to send a
letter to one of the Eighteenth Infantry,
U. S. A., stationed at the Philippines, di
rect the letter to the individual by name,
rank, letter of company, number of regi
ment and Manila, P. 1., and it will reach
him in due course of time. If his com
pany does not happen to be in the city of
Manila the letter will be forwarded to
the point where the company Is located.
SAN GABRIEL RESERVATION â P.
F., City. The area of San Gabriel reser
vation in Los Angeles County is 573,048
acres. The western boundary line is dis
tant about four miles from San Fernando,
on the Southern Pacific. The principal
streams in the reservation are Rio de la
Luna, San Gabriel Creek, Cow Creek and
Tujunga Creek. The reservation is held
for watershed and timber. It cannot be
claimed or settled, because it is land re
served by the President under an act of
Congress.
LANDâ W. S., Occidental, Sonoma
County, Cal. By the act of Congress of
September 28, ISSO, the United States
granted to each and every State all of
those swamp and overflowed lands made
unfit thereby for cultivation which re
mained unsold on the date of the ap
proval of the act. The government of the
several States offered such lands for sale,
and no one would have a right to seize
such lands. The question as to what
rights owners of land on the bank of a
creek under certain conditions would
have is one that this department cannot
answer, as it is one that can be answered
only by a court of competent jurisdiction
after a hearing of the facts.
THRASHING MACHINEâ J. S. E., Sa
vannah, Ga. In California there was con
structed an apparatus for cutting, thrash
ing- and winnowing grain in the field. It
is a large grain frame, supported on two
heavy driving wheels, and has two lighter
ones in front as guiding wheels. Project
ing from the sides of this frame is a plat
form like that of an ordinary reaper, but
about twelve feet long. This runs at such
height that the reciprocating sickle at
the front will cut off the heads from vie
standing grain; the heads fall on an
endless apron running longitudinally up
on the platform and are carried by this
to a hopper that conducts them to a
thrashing cylinder having a fanning mill
and straw separator arranged behind it.
The thrashed and winnnowed grain is
thrown out from the fan mill through
a spout at the side, directly into
the mouth of a sack suspended
under the spout. An attendant riding
upon the platform ties the sacks when
full and throws them upon the ground,
to be collected at leisure.

TEACHERS MUST
GIVE WAY TO
CONSOLIDATION
Personal and Political Influence
Will Not Weigh Against the
Policy of Reform.
The Reclassification of the Public Schools
to Be Finished Within Sixty
Daysâ No Service No Com
pensation.
THERE has V>een no event In the j
history of the public schools of
this city that ever excited such
â widespread comment as the meet
ing of the School Board held on
Wednesday night. There is a
spirit of unrest among the teach
ers In the department, and many are |
itfready threatening to brine legal ac- j
tion to prevent the Directors from j
carrying out their policy of economy
a.nd consolidation. While the resolu
tions, rescinding the concluding acts
â  last board, have brought many
up in arms, it is the proposition of
wholesale consolidation in the day and
night schools that has created the
.most general uneasiness.
â  .The Directors are firm in their In
tention to reduce the teaching force of
â tin- department to what they believe Is
a. legitimate basis. An absolute prom
ise is given that no personal or politi
cal Influence will prevent the proper
reorganization of the department. All
schools that have not an average at
tendance of fifty pupils for every teach
er must be immediately reclassifled
and the surplus teachers sent to the
Superintendent for instructions. This
refers to the day schools, and in the
night schools, where the greatest
abuses have grown up, a similar pro
cess will be followed.
It is in the night schools that the
greatest consolidation will take place.
Fully one-half the teachers in these
schools, it is estimated, will be consoli
dated out. In the day schools a great
dea-1 of latitude must necessarily be
given to suit varying conditions. The
Â£eclaSÃlfication of the scnools will beein
on Monday and will proceed as rapid
ly as possible. Where it is found that
:n certain schools do not
an attendance of fifty pupils an
â¢igation will be made. If it is
found that the school cannot maintain
fflciency by consolidating the class
th-< teacher will be allowed to remain.
This work of investigation and ad
justment will necessarily be long. In
the work of reorganization, which is
practically revolution in the school de
partment,' the Directors intend to take
every precaution to prevent demorali
zation. It would be dangerous to leave
large classes without instructors and
this will not be done. It is estimated
that the labor of reorganization, reclas
sification and .consolidation will take
fully two months. At the end of that
time the board expects to have the de
partment in a' normal and healthy con
dition. . 'â¢
A 43 soon as Superintendent Webster
finishes his report he will submit it to
the board for consideration. The rt_
.port will include a list of the teachers
who did not have classes of fifty pupils
and a statement of the circum
stances in each case. The board will
then take action. It has been prac
tically determined that there shall be
no unassigned list of teachers. It is
claimed that no law will justify the
payment of teachers who give nothing
in return. The members of the new
board insist that they cannot be com
pelled to pay salaries of instructors
â¢who have nothing to do.
There will be therefore no unassigned
list. What will be done with the teach
ers that arc- consolidated out of the
schools remains to be seen. That they
will not be' paid is a certainty. Whether
or n<>t an attempt will.be made to con
solidate them .out of the department is
a question that will be' answered when
the proper time Comes. Some of the
Directors go so far as to say, however,
that the courts will sustain the board
even if useless teachers are con
solidated out of the department. There
are many decisions of the State courts
which declare that such a course is
impossible, but the board is in a mood
to take the chances and throw the
burden of vindication upon those that
may be injured .in. the. consolidation.
This question is, of course, far broader
and more far reaching than that which
has arisen over the resolution whicn
rescinded the concluding acts of the
last board. One affects a few teachers
and the other involves the interests of
them all.
After the tremendous work of reor
ganization and consolidation has beeL
accomplished attention will be given to
the labor of investigating the special
departments. These, departments are
greatly overcrowded and a great deal
of pruning will be done.
In speaking of the- matter yesterday
Director E. L. Head outlined very
clearly the proposed policy of the board.
"It is not the purpose of the board to
satisfy either personal' or political obli
gations in this matter," he said. "We
have a great labor to perform to restore
the School Department to its normal
condition. It is to be regretted that
some teachers in the department must
suffer, but personal interests must be
subordinated to a public policy and the
welfare of the School Department. Con
solidation is absolutely necessary and
it will take place.
"The untruth <if the rumors that
there was friction in the board was
demonstrated at the meeting last night.
The board, as every one saw, is a unit
upon matters that appeal as just.
Whatever is good for the department
will, I have no d.oubt, get the unani
mous support of the board. As a mat
ter of course there was some friction
during the period of our organization,
but that was to be expected. It is in
cidental to all organizations and ours
is no exception. After organization
was completed everything ran smoothly
and the members of the board are now
as one in hearty support of every meas
ure that will be beneficial to the schools.
"It is absolutely criminal to be pay
ing teachers for doing nothing and the
practice will be stopped. I believe in
this matter that we have the hearty
indorsement of- the people of the city.
We are expected to remedy some of the
evils that were created by the last
board and to rehabilitate the School
Department. This we will endeavor to
do to thje best of pur ability, and if the
private Interests of some must suffer
that cannot be helped. "We are pledged
to give a good administration."
For Contempt of Court.
Isaac Friedman, a young man, living on
Sixteenth street, near Howard, was sent
to prison yesterday morning- by Justice
of the Peace Barry, acting- for Judge Con
lan, for contempt of court. Friedman was
arrested about ten days ago by Policeman
C. M. Barnes for attempting to strike him
and for using vulgar language toward
him. Policeman Bode was one of the wit
nesses for the prosecution, and after ho
had finished his testimony Friedman
threateningly told him that he would

the remark, and gave him twenty-four
hours for contempt. He was convicted of
using vulgar language, and will be sen
tenced this morning.
Napa Bankrupts.
Marks Wallenburg and Amalla, his
wife, of Napa County filed a petition in in
solvency yesterday in the United States
District Court. Their liabilities are

THE FASTEST THING OF HER CLASS AFLOAT
THE new Japanese cruiser Chitose returned from her trials at Santa Barbara Channel yesterday morning and went to the Union Iron Works. She will now be
got ready for turning over to the Japanese authorities. Prior to that, however, she will go outside and run forty knots, making the same number of revo
lutions that were got out of the engines when she was under trial in the Santa Barbara Channel. This will be done in order to fulfill the letter of the con
tract. The Chitose had to go four times over a ten mile course at a speed of not less than twenty and a half knots an hour, and another four times at twenty
two and a half knots. She fulfilled thcs.e requirements easily, averaging over the eighty miles twenty-two and three-quarter knots an hour while the maximum
speed was 22.867 knots, a fraction below twenty-three knots an hour. This makes the Chitose the fastest cruiser afloat. The last forty miles, however was not
covered during one run. When twenty miles of the distance had been covered some of the condenser tubes went wrong and the vessel had to go back to Santa
Barbara for repairs. Another attempt was made, and again the condenser tubes went wrong after twenty miles had been covered. The Japanese experts aboard
the cruiser were more than satisfied with the showing she had made, and expressed themselves as highly pleased. During a six hours 1 consecutive run she aver
aged 21 1-10 knots an hour, her maximum being 21 4-10 knots.
â During the run up the roast from Santa Barbara to San Francisco the cruiser was tested in every possible way. With the engines making ninety revolu
tions a minute she logged 14 7-10 knots an hour. When she was making 20^> knots an hour it took forty-five seconds lor her to stop and gather sternway. With
one wheel backing and the other going ahead she turned in a circle, the diameter of which was 300 feet, and going full speed ahead she turned In a circle the dl
â  ameter of which was 600 feet.
"We had a pleasant trip from Santa Barbara until we reached Pigeon Point," said Irving M. Scott yesterday. "There we ran into a fog and had to slow
down. When the fog lifted we came in and made fast to the mooring buoy off the Union Ironworks at 6:40 a, m. The Chitose steers like a yacht and is a
splendid sea boat. She is the finest and fastest vessel of her class afloat and will uphold the credit of San Francisco wherever she goes. Her natural gait Is 20 knots an
hour with the engines making 134 revolutions."
After making the two hours' run at sea the Chitose will remain here a fortnight and will then start for Yokohama

LIEUTENANT
HANNAH IS IN
DEEP DISGRACE
Helplessly Drunk on
the Street.
SAYS HE WAS VERY ILL
TAKEN TO THE HARBOR STA
TION, BUT RELEASED.
Formal Charges to Be Preferred
Against Him by Captain Dun
levy â Chief Lees In
dignant.
Lieutenant Hannah of the Southern
police station is in deep disgrace. Anx
ious to make himself a good fellow with
the boys Tuesday night, he so far forgot
himself as to get gloriously intoxicated.
Shortly after 10 o'clock he was found
lying on the sidewalk at Spear and Mar
ket streets helplessly drunk and feebly
calling fur assistance.
Two citizens who were passing, think
ing he was the victim of thugs, lost no
time in notifying the sergeant at the
harbor police station. Officer Hiram
Smith was at once dispatched to the
scone, and not recognizing Hannah, he
summoned a citizen, who assisted him In
taking the disgraced lieutenant to the
police station. While in the act of search
ing his prisoner Smith was astounded to
find a policeman's star pinned to his
breast.
During the searching process the desk
sergeant took no notice of Hannah,
thinking he was an ordinary drunk, but

COMPROMISE

The Shadow for the People and

Proposed Action of the New Railroad Com
mission in Reference to the Hard-
Fought and Long -Pending
Grain-Rate Case.
AFTER being in litigation for three
years the question of reduced grain
rates in this State promises to be
settled shortly to the apparent ad
vantage of the farmer and to the entire
satisfaction of the Railroad Commission
and of the Southern Pacific Company.
The expense to the State in its efforts to
force the Southern Pacific to reduce grain
rates 8 per cent throughout the State Is
said to have been not. less than $30,000,
and a suit In connection with the matter
is still pending in the United States Cir
cuit Court. The action was brought by
the railroad company to enjoin tho Rail
road Commission from putting into effect
the reduced rates on grain.
During the campaign just closed and at
the final meeting of the old Board of
Railroad Commissioners H. M. La Rue
stated that W. H. Mills, representing
himself as the agent of the Southern Pa
cific Company, came to him and made a
proposition that the railroad company
would put into effect the commission's
reduced grain rates and would dismiss
the pending suit providing the commis
sion would agree to forego any further
action on its resolution of intention to
reduce all rates in The State 25 per cent.
Nothing, however, came of this, because,
according to the further statement of
Mr. La Rue, the railroad company failed
to submit its offer in writing.
--t the meeting of the new Railroad
Commission yesterday the matter came
up, and a brief informal discussion of it
resulted in Commissioner Blackstock be
ing appointed a committee of one to wait
upon W. F. Herrln of the .Southern l'a
clflc Company to ascertain If the com
pany was still of Hi" same mind as when
Mr. 'Mills made its proposition to Mr. La
Rue.
On being asked individually if they
as soon as the arresting officer discoV
ered the star he at once took charge of
the lieutenant and conducted him into
the gymnasium in the rear of the sta
tion, ile was kept there for over four
hours, iind as he pleaded to be released
he was allowed to go on his promise that
he would return to his home.
Captain Dunlevy put in an appearance
a short time aft< rward, and on being told
of the disgraceful condition of Hannah
he communicated the facts to Chief L,ees.
The latter ordered him to make a written
report and also Instructed him to obtain
the names of the two citizens who had
discovered the officer helplessly drunk.
To-day formal charges of drunkenness
and failing to report for duty at 12
o'clock Tuesday night will be fIU-d against
Hannah.
A short time prior to the big strike on
the Sutter street railroad Hannah was
the driver of an express wagon. In some
way ho managed to ingratiate himself
into tho confidence of the strikers, and
subsequently betrayed them to the po
lice. For this act Patrick Crowley, who
was then Chiof of Police, made him a
member of the department. A few
months later he appointed him sergeant
of police, finally promoting him to the
position which he now occupies.
It is understood that the Police Com
missioners will investigate the charges
at thoir meeting next Wednesday night.
THE CUSTOMS INVESTIGATION.
Special Agents Smith and Link Begin
the Inquiry Into the Moore-
Meredith Scandals.
Special Agents Smith and Link
yesterday morning began their in
vestigation into the charges of
immorality preferred against Special
Agent Moore by ex-Collector "Wise. The
investigation is being conducted behind
closed doors in the office of Surveyor
Spear. Agent Smith said the report of the
proceedings, together with the testimony
and the affidavits, would be forwarded to
Washington to the Treasury Department,
which would act upon the matter. He
said also that the investigation would em
brace the Chinese bureau as well,
Chiof Meredith glpefully informed the
reporters yesterday that he was not going
to be investigated, because no charges
would accept the offer of the railroad
company to compromise, as outlined,
none of the three members of the com
mission showed the slightest hesitation
in t-tating that they would, adding that
they thought it best for the interests of
the State and of the farmers.
"When Mr. Herrin was asked what the
railroad would do he declined to discuss
the subject, saying he would first await
the action of the commission.
Mr. Mills also refused to say anything
further on the matter than to remark
that the railroad company had never
made denial of Mr. L,a Rue's assertion
regarding the proposed compromise.
Should the compromise be effected it
would mean that there will be no attempt
made by the commission to reduce rates
in California during the four years of its
term of office. For this reason it is likely
that the railroad company will not be
found difficult to deal with, so far as the
proposed settlement of the grain rate case
is concerned. Another reason why the
railroad is not averse to dismissing the
pending suit is that the rates on grain
have already been reduced more than the
contemplated 8 per cent in the richest
territory that it tapsâ the San Joaquin
Valleyâ by the advent and completion of
the Valley road.
Tin- only thing done relative to the in
vestigation of the rates charged" by the
I'ullman Palace Car Company was to in-
Btruci the secretary of the board to ask
Attorney General Ford for an opinion
relative" to the jurisdiction of the board
in the matter. The Attorney General's
office was represented by Deputy G. A.
Sturtevant, who stated that in connection
with the Pullman Company's case a ques
tion of fact as to whether or not the Pull
man Company was a transportation com
pany would also have to be decided. Feb
ruary 14 was set for a final hearing of this
case, and it was decided to meet on the
16th inst. to hear the report of Commis
sioner JJlackstock on the grain rate case.
had been preferred against him. Agent
Smith's statement to the contrary, how
ever, may cause him and his backers a
little uneasiness, but Collector Jackson
is standing by him. and there is no doubt
that there is a whitewash brush handy
somewhere in the vicinity of the Collect
or's office.
SUSTAIN THE MAYOR'S VETU.
Furnishing of the Hall of Justice
Postponed for Some Time.
The Street Committee of the Board of
Supervisors met yesterday for the first
time. Supervisors Holland, Collins and
Attrldge of the committee and Supervisor
Perrault of the Finance Committee at
tended. Many matters of minor import
ance in regard to sewer and street work
were deferred for a week, pending further
Inquiry.
The committee considered the Mayor's
veto of the resolution appropriating $77,000
for furnishing the Hall of Justice on
Kearny street. After some discussion, it
was ill termined to report the veto back
and to recommend to the board that it be
sustained. According to ex-Auditor Brod
erick, the original appropriation having
been exhausted, no more money can be
spent on the new building without legis
lative action. If this be the correct view
of the situation it will be necessary for
the Legislature to pass an enabling act
before the building can be furnished and
ready for occupancy by the police and
other departments.
The matter is where it was some months
since, and the contracts must be read
vertised by the board if it finds it has the
legal right to apportion the necessary
funds.
Dalmatian TT. E. Club.

was a banquet, and there were a num

the new officers and several invited
guests.

HIGHBINDERS
MASQUERADE
AS EDUCATORS
Police Raid an Edu
cational Society.
HATCHETMEN ARE MEMBERS
MOST VICIOUS ELEMENT IN
CHINATOWN INCLUDED.
Many of the Robberies and Murders
in Chinatown Can Be Traced
to the Organiza
tion.
Lieutenant Esola and Detective Ed Gib
son last evening raided the Chinese Edu-
national Society at 709 Commercial street
and notified the members that the place
must be closed by noon to-day. The po
lice are of the belief that this so-called
educational society is nothing but a high
binder organization and that its member
ship is made up of the most vicious ele
ment in Chinatown. They think that a
great many of the robberies and murders
are committed by men belonging to the
society and are of the opinion that if
they are able to break up the association
the work of keeping peace among the
Mongolians will be an easier matter.
The society has been in existence for
several years and was thought to be a
legitimate educational organization until
recently. The headquarters has been
watched of late and the police have failed
to find any one frequenting the rooms
who looked as if they thirsted for knowl
edge. Yesterday Ong Foon, one of the
ringleaders of the society, was arr. ea
on a warrnt for attempted extortion.
The particular case for which ho was
taken into custody was an attemrt he
made to blackmail a woman in Suiiivan
alley, but It is known that he ha.- tried
the same game before with better suc
cess.
The members of the organization have
been engaged in the business of securing
the fraudulent admission of women into
the United States and for their services
fabulous prices are charged. Then after
the woman is allowed to enter rfhe or her
owner is blackmailed and made to pay
the society so much each month.
After the visit of the polio' last n.ght
the members held a meeting and decided
to vacate their rooms. The See xups,
hearing of the affair, also held a meeting
and while nothing could be learned as
to what they did it is believed that they
will take steps to see that the society is
broken up.
Robberies and blackmailing are more
frequent in Chinatown just now than at
any other time of the year. Every Chi
naman is laying up money for the new
year, which begins next month, and tjie
highbinders are as anxious to celebrate
as the good Chinamen. They are levy
ing tribute on the merchants, and hardly
a day passes that some of the reputable
Chinese citizens are not the recipients
of demands for money, with a threat at
tached that if the demand is not com
plied with they will be robbed or in
jured.
Last night Ah Sin made an attempt to
secure something for the coming festivi
ties by entering a store on Jackson
street. He was caught in the act by Of
ficers Freel and Klvnn and will probably
spend New Year's in jail.
Defies the Fire Wardens.
A warrant was sworn out in Judge Con-
1 /?, n .' s < , c< i vi^ yesterday on the complaint of
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department
for the arrest of Dr. Julius Rosenstirn.

story building on the corner of Sutter
and Hyde streets to place a fire escape
and stand pipe on the building, but he
has refused to comply with the request

FIRE IN THE CITY HALL.
A Careless Deputy in the County
Clerk's Office Causes a Com
motion.
For about an hour yesterday morning
there was considerable excitement on the
first floor and basement of the City Hall,
caused by an alarm of fire. Smoke was
seen issuing through, a chimney in the
County Clerk's office, and it was thought
that one of the rooms underneath was on.
lire.
Chief Sullivan, Assistant Chief Dough
erty and other members of the Fire De
partment made a hurried search through
the rooms on the first floor, but therts
was no sign of fire. A broken grate in the
warrant clerk's room of Judge Conlan'a
court led to the supposition that a live
coal had set fire to the woodwork under
neath, but this Idea, after an examina
tion, was abandoned. The hasement was
then searched, and the cause of the smoke
was discovered in the shooting range of
the Police Department.
Some careless deputy in the County
Clerk's office had thrown a live cigarette
into the flue in the office, and it descended
to the basement and set fire to a lot of
rubbish. A chemical engine had been
summoned, but Its services were not re
quired.

town and will then proceed to New York
where they will make their future home,'
Hatch Not Responsible.
The assignment of Dalton Bros.,
commission merchants, to the American
Bank and Trust Company for the benefit
of creditors has caused considerable com
ment among the business men of this
city. The firm is one of the oldest, and
was supposed to be one of the best estab
lished in the State, its correspondents
and patrons being numerous the length
of the entire coast. At first it was sup
posed that the failure was due to a con
siderable extent to the failure of A. T.
Hatch, who at one time was among' the
largest fruit growers in California, and
who recently went through bankruptcy
Mr. Hatch states that the financial
troubles of the Daltons are in no way
connected with his own. It Is true, he
said, that he had many dealings with the
