MANILA, Feb. 10- â
Victory has once more
rested on the American
arms, and the town of
Caloocan, undoubtedly
the strongest rebel po
sition in the island of
Luzon, is ours.
The place was not won with
out a struggle. For the past two
days Aguinaldo, the rebel leader,
has been doing" everything in his
power to draw supporters to his
banner, in order that he might
attempt to retrieve the disaster
â¢that' befell his forces when he
/Opened the attack on the Ameri
; cans, and regain the prestige lost
â¢through defeat. The rebels had
recovered some of their courage,
and for three hours held their po
sition. Then they could no
â¢Monger stand the American fire
.and abandoned their fortifica
tion?.
â¢â¢ .' It was reported that Aguinaldo
had gathered the flower* of the
.Filipino army at Caloocan, and
: all his preparations indicated that
he intended to make a desperate
attempt to withstand the further
advance of the Americans.
â¢Caloocan, which is about six
.miles north of Manila, is so situ
ated that it is within easy range
of the guns of the warships.
There is no high ground down to
the sea. the town being separated
from the bay of Manila by a wide

The plan for the attack on the
. place provided that the warships
should open the ball. At half

THE OFFICIAL REPORT.
\ WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â The following dispatch from General
Otis was received to-night: i** V;' '
1 MANILA, Feb. 10.â Adjutant General: The insurgents collected
Inconsiderable force between Manila and Caloocan, where Aguinaldo
was reported to be, and threatened to cause an uprising in ' the city.
This afternoon I swung the left of Mac Arthur's division, which is
north of the Pasig River, into Caloocan, driving the enemy easily. Our
left is now at Caloocan. Our loss was slight, that of the insurgents
considerable. Particulars in the morning. v Â":

which, near the town proper, af
forded excellent shelter for the
native soldiers who were not in
the trenches or otherwise dis
posed of. Some of these men had
the reputation of being sharp
shooters, but their work did not
justify the title, as the damage
done by them was trifling.
The artillery and the warships
pounded away until 4 o'clock,
when orders were given for Gen
eral Harrison G. Otis' brigade,
except the Pennsylvania regi
ment, which was held as a re
serve, to move on the enemy's
works. The men had been impa
tiently waiting for the order, and
as the word was passed down the
line responded with cheers.
The . movement was made in
the following order from left to

age. The Americans declined to
answer, but pressed steadily for
ward. They marched through
the woods and banana groves
from the left, but on the right
their route was mainly through
paddy fields, which afforded no
protection from the rebel fire.
Not a single stop was made un
til they reached the intrench-
ments, from which most of the
natives .had hastily scrambled as
the Americans drew near. The
former were attempting to make
their way with all speed to the
shelter afforded by the town, but
scores failed to reach the goal,
being stopped by American bul
lets.
Just at this time - the enemy
was thrown - into worse confu
sion by the discovery that they
had been flanked: A company of
the First Montana Infantry, un
der command of Major J. Frank
lin Bell, chief of the bureau of
military information, had volun
teered to execute a flank move
ment, and moving to the east
had,, without being detected, ar
rived |at the enemy's flank back
in the town.
The natives saw they were
trapped and, scattering, fled like
sheep, many dropping their
weapons in their anxiety to es
cape. < . â¢* â 
The Americans jumped into
the trenches and, yelling and
screaming like madmen in their
lust of : battle, were in full pur
suit. It was simply a rout and
proved that, even with the aid of
artificial defenses, the Filipinos
are no match for Americans.
There is a large church in Ca
loocan, which is really a fort. It
was strongly defended, and it was
thought that here the Filipinos
might attempt to make a stand,
but after the capture of the town
it was found that the warships
had made the place too hot for
the natives, and they had aban
doned this position without a
struggle. Barricades had been
erected at the place where " the
Malabon road crosses the line of
the Dagupan Railway, in the cen-;
ter of the town. These had been
torn to pieces in many places by
the fire from the warships and
land batteries.

REFUSES TO RUN
FOR PRESIDENCY
Under No Circun)staQces Would
Dewey Consent to Become
a Candidate.
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â Washington correspondent of the Her
ald telegraphs: Rear Admiral Dewey will not accept a nomination for
the Presidency. This has been the opinion of his close friends here. for
some time and they have not hesitated to say from their knowledge of
the man that nothing was more Improbable than that he would allow
himself to be drawn into the field of politics. A confirmation of this
view of the most- positive kind â¢ has lately come to my knowledge. A
friend of Judge "Brawley. of South Carolina, who Is an Intimate friend
of Admiral Dewey, -tells me that on his recent visit to this city the
Judge showed him a letter lately received from Dewey, in which the ad
miral said that he would under no circumstances be a candidate for
the Presidency; that his training had been on other lines and that his
temperament was such that he could not endure the strain, and that
much as he appreciated the sentiments of friendship, and confidence
which led to the mention of his name in connection with that office he
begged his friends not to consider it a possibility. ',',-,
. I saw Judge Brawley just as he was leaving the city and asked if
he had any objection to giving the letter for publication. He said that
he could not; with propriety do so; that while he did not consider it
of such confidential nature as to make it improper .for him to show it
to I any of - his â¢ friends he was unwilling to make it public. ; He had. not
enjoined secrecy upon, any of those .who had. read the letter, Judge
Brawley added,' but if , the fact that* such a 'letter was received became
known through him he .would leave It to them to determine the ques
tion of ; the propriety involved.
cans extinguished the fires. \
The losses of the Americans
were slight, but the enemy lost
heavily both in killed and wound
ed. Most of the casualties to the
Filipinos were caused by shrap
nel, the screaming and awful ef
fect of which caused terror
among the natives.
Among the Americans wound
ed is Colonel Bruce Wallace of
the First Montana Infantry.
After the Americans were in
possession of the town it was
found there i was only one house
in the place that had a flagstaff.
This belonged to Higgins, an
Englishman, president of the Da
gupan Railway. He loaned the
staff to Otis, and at 5:30 o'clock
the American flag was floating
over the town. \2 The appearance
was greeted with enthusiastic
cheering by the troops.
The insurgent troops , were
massing to the support of Agui
naldo's forces )at Caloocan > and
Malabon when - the fighting be
gan. It was reported this morn
ing that there were ; 6000 : rebels
at the two places, 4 , among ; them
being the famous Seventy-third
j Filipino Regiment, which -in the
last rebellion \ killed their Spanish
officers ':;â¢â  and U then deserted to
Aguinaldo.
Aguinaldo himself is at Mari
lao, making desperate attempts
to reorganize his demoralized
forces. His next move is un-
known. He cannot go to Mala
bon, as by so doing he would
again expose his army to attack
from the warships, which would
easily get within range of that
place, and it is likely he will move
up the valley in the direction of
Malolos, which he constituted
the capital of the so-called Phil
ippine republic.

TO ARREST

Otis Made Demands for the
Release of the Spanish
Prisoners.
The Filipino Leader Pleaded That
Monks and Civil Functionaries
Should Be Kept in Jail.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â From let
ters written to Major General Otis by
Aguinaldo, obtained to-day from Senor
Luna of the Filipino junta here and
brother of Aguinaldo's Minister of War.
it appears Otis threatened Aguinaldo
with arrest if he persisted in his re
fusal to release the Spanish civil func
tionaries and monks held as prisoners
by the insurgents.
General Otis advised Aguinaldo to
surrender . these people, and when
Aguinaldo wrote explaining his rea
sons for holding them General Otis
made a stronger request. Aguinaldo
refused to comply, and then Otis made
a demand for the release of the pris
oners and threatened jto arrest Aguin
aldo if he refused. The first letter from
Aguinaldo follows:
General Otis: It is a pleasure for me to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter
yesterday, and I am persuaded thÂ© ob
servations made by you were learned in a
free land. First let me tell "you It Is not
my policy to make prisoners of women
and children. No nun has ever been held
a prisoner by Philippine forces. If among
our prisoners is found- a child or, woman
it is because those persons have elected
to remain with father or husband. Some
prisoners of this class are supported out
of the Philippine treasury. I know this
is apparently a violation of the rules and
usages of war as . practiced by civilized
nations, but think it is a policy dictated
by the principles of humanity. These
women and children may have liberty if
they desire it.
You declare the Spanish civil func
tionaries and Spanish ; monks may
not be Imprisoned without violations of
the rules of international law. We have
never made prisoners of the Spanish sec
ular clergy, but have captured and im
prisoned monks. I feel on this subject
the foreign mind has been very much
misled. I desire to remind you the Span
ish civil functionaries and Spanish monks
are such in name only. At the beginning
of the war between America and Spain
General Augustin organized the civil em
ployes into an armed corps and they con
tinued to bear arms against . the Philip
pine people. It Is true they did not go
much into the fields of battle, but were
useful to Spain in harassing and terror
izing unarmed and Inoffensive Filipinos.
These people subjected thousands of my
people to cruel, unnatural and* unneces
sary tortures. ,
â  In the matter of Spanish monks, permit
me to tell you they have done more than
any other class In enslaving the people.
In times of peace this class has levied
tribute from my people. The, canon laws
of the Roman Catholic .church forbid
that monks. shall take up arms, enter
military service or actively participate in
politics. The Spanish monks in the Phil
ippines have done all these things. They
have long deceived . the Vatican. When
the secular- clergy, who are Filipinos,
sought to bring the abuses to the atten
tion of the high authorities In the church
they were persecuted and tortured by
monks and powerful religious corpora
tions. These monks pretended to 7 the
Spanish authorities that to them waa due
in the main the subjection of the Fili
pinos and the maintenance of the Span
ish sovereignty in the Islands. The Span
ish functionaries, who were cognizant of
this deception, did not disclose it, as
they, were in the hire of rich ecclessias
tlcal corporations. ' 'J '/â¢'.
The leading cause of the Philippine rev
olution may be attributed justly to the
machinations of these alleged men of
God. They have kept a closed door ,to
liberty and progress. All the foreigners
who have studied the Philippine situation
will bear me out in this statement. '
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
; General. .in view of the history of
these monks, and the power which by rea
son of their gold they are able to exer
cise over certain classes of weak. and fa
natical Filipinos, it is not good public pol
icy that they should be allowed liberty
at this time.
I believe the Philippine republic must re
strain Jthe civil functionaries until such
time as they shall be deported and shall
keep th** monks in confinement until they
shall he forced by the Vatican to abstain
from politics in the islands. It is neither
hate nor revenge which Impels me to
maintain these persons in confinement.
Their Imprisonment Is dictated by public
policy. My people demand these men De
held prisoners, and I can but obey their
will. If you will present these views and
reasons to the free people of America I
know you will earn the love and good will
of the people of the Philippine Islands.
; > In reply to the demand of Otis '.for
the delivery; of the prisoners Aguinaldo
wrote' as follows:
' In my previous letter I explained to you
my reasons for holding persons indicated
as prisoners of war. .You say that accord
ing to the rules of international law men
should not be held as prisoners of war
unless they have actually borne arms in
the service of the enemy. ' This is my con
tention. The Spanish civil functionaries
and monks have borne arms against my
people. My conduct has been comform
able to the principles you lay down. In
addition to actually bearing arms the
civil functionaries and monks have aided
and abetted in every way within their
power the enemies of my people. If you
will read the Spanish newspapers printed
at Manila you will find therein a verifica
tion of what I tell you with regard to
the conduct of the monks and civil func
tionaries during the Philippine revolution.
The monks threw away their sacred
robes, violated our women and made
slaves of defenseless Filipinos. They con
fiscated the property of my people. ' In
my treatment of these men I am not
moved by motives of venegeance. It is a
notorious fact that these monks served
as officers of volunteers. There was one
volunteer corps recruited altogether from
monks. Convents and monasteries were
transferred Into forts and arsenals. Many
arms and much ammunition were taken
from these places by my troops.
I have followed the principle of interna
tional law as laid down by Flore. Mar
tens, Bluntschll and others. These writ
ers hold that any person who goes forth
to war as a part of the force of an enemy
may be held as a prisoner. Encyclopedia
Hispano-Americano says: "All who form
a part of the enemy's force, even Includ
ing newspaper correspondents and troops
of the commissary department, may be
held as prisoners of war."
Rt-j/prisal is an admitted right by cul
tured nations. I recall that during the
war for American Independence the great
Washington, to avenge the execution of
an American colonel taken prisoner by
the British, ordered the execution of a
British' colonel held prisoner by the Amer
icans. * This order was not carried out,
thanks to the intercession of the Queen
of France. v .^h 4
Even if I have no right under the rules
of international law to hold these people
as prisoners I certainly have this right
under. the rules of reprisal, as I wish to
compel the Spaniards to release the Fili
pinos held as prisoners and to avenge the
horrid tortures inflicted on the Filipinos
who fell into the hands of the enemy. As
I said in my previous letter, the rules of
international law must be silent before
the just and righteous cause of a people
engaged in a struggle for independence.
Although the Filipinos have not been rec
ognized by cultured nations, they havo
the glory of having obeyed all rules of
war as practiced by those of high na
tions.2

WASHINGTON, Feb. 10.â General de
bate on the sundry civil appropriation
bill was concluded to-day. Dockery of '.

minority of the ' Appropriation Commit
tee, reinforced Cannon's figures of yes
terday as to the deficiency in the rev
enues; De 'Armond of Missouri. Fillette
of Massachusetts and others discussed
the policy of expansion, and Lentz of
( >hA severely criticized the administra
tion for. exercising clemency in the case _
of General Eagan. The latter charged
that there was an evident disposition
to reward those who -attacked General â¢
Miles because the latter had had the
manhood to tell the truth about alleged
rotten food fed to our troops ln Porto
Rico and Cuba. During the course of
the debate Hepburn, chairman of the "
Interstate and Foreign Commerce Com
mittee, gave notice that he would of
fer the Nicaragua canal bill as an :
amendment to the sundry civil bill.
Brosius (R.) of Pennsylvania, the first
speaker to-day. characterized the $20,000,-
--ikW to be paid to Spain under the terms,
of the Paris treaty a mere- bagatelle. -
Dockery (D.) of Missouri, who followed,
congratulated the" country upon the state
ment made by Cannon yesterday. Had
it been made earlier, he said, the country
might have been saved many millions of
dollars. . Dockery produced figures to
show that there was already in sight a
deficiency of $.7,000,000 for the next fiscal .
year. But this was exclusive of the addi
tional expenditure of $2,500,000 involved in
the naval personnel bill, the new ships to
be authorized in the naval appropriation
bill, the Cuban claims, the JU.-jO'j.u'JO for
public buildings and the enormous ex
penditures involved in the Hanna-Payne
subsidy bill and the bill for the construc
tion of the Nicaragua canal, should either, .
of these latter bills be passed. After the
Civil War, be said. Congress had rev
eled and. rioted in the substance of the
people, but the Forty-fourth Congress had
come. Dockery predicted that another
"Forty-fourth" Congress: would come, at
least a Congress animated -by. the spirit
that controlled the Forty-fourth, and it
would cut down the tax burdens of the
people. ' %
Johnson (R.) of Indiana asked how the
expenditures could be reduced under, the
foreign policy entered upon by the admin
istration. ....-*, ' . * *.-* '
Dockery replied that circumstances
would probably necessitate large In
creases In the cost of our military and j
naval establishments, but he did believe
there could be a great reduction in Gov- *
ermental expenditures.
"You mean, then," Interposed John
son, "that -we must cut down, the ex
penses for our Internal affairs at home in
order that we may be able to support a
great army and navy abroad?" .
"I am not sure but that the gentleman
is about right," replied Dockery. "Some
where the pruning knife must belaid or
else the tax burdens of the people must
be increased." -'...â¢â¢_. â â "â >

HEPBURN'S PLAN
TO BUILD CANAL
Resulted From Numer
ous Conferences..;, .
Special Dispatch to The Call.
'* WASHINGTON, Feb. 10â Represen- j
. tatlve Hepburn's notice .in the House of |
Representatives that the Nicaraguan '
canal bill would be offered as an j
.amendment to. the sundry civil bill re-.
suited from the numerous conferences j
held to-day. Early in the day Chair- i
man Burton of the River and Harbor ;
Committee, conferred with Senator j
Morgan with a view to having him
leave the river and harbor bill unin
cumbered. _ i _V
Morgan is understood to have assent
ed not to embarrass the river and har
bor bill. This in turn led to consid
eration' of the sundry civil bill as the
medium for advancing tne Nicaragua
canal bill. As a result, Hepburn gave
the formal notice. The .amendment 1
which he proposes is the Hepburniblll
providing jf pr the construction of\he
canal. It: appropriates) $115,000,000 for
canal construction and authorizes the
President to negotiate with Nicaragua
and Costa Rica for the route.
The main difficulty, lies in the rule
which will be invoked ' against the
amendment. This rule provides that
no appropriation shall be ln order on j
any general appropriation bill for any
expenditure "not previously authorized |
by law." It is claimed on the one hand j
that this rule will positively exclude i
the amendment,, but Hepburn points ;
out that Congress has already .author- I
ized and appropriated for two' surveys
of the Nicaragua canal in sundry civil
bills and also increased the compensa
tion of the engineer in charge in one
of these surveys. Upon these acts of
Congress it will be claimed that the
amendment is not obnoxious â¢ to the
rule and is germane.
Should Sherman of New Tork. .who
is ' -hairrnah Jof the conjimittee of* the
'Whole, rule it Out of order, it is possible
that the friends of the bill will seek
to overrule the chairman. Indeed, some

I Gillett (R.) of Massachusetts declared
that he had rather pay $20,000,000 to be
honorably .rid of the Phihlippines than
to pay $20,000,000 to keep them. The Is
lands could not, ln his opinion, ever be
Americanized. Corruption and demoral

be no compensating advantages.
Klrkpatrick (R.) of Pennsylvania de

concluded the debate for the day with a
denunciation of the President for com
muting the sentence of Commissary-Gen
eral Eagan. He declared that General
Eagan'- attack upon General Miles had
no parallel in military history. He called
General Miles a liar for simply telling the
truth to which 50,000 private soldiers could
testify. The troops had been fed rotten
beef, said 'Lentz. and yet General Eagan
was to be suspended with p:.v for six
years and then be retired on three-fourths
pay because he had denounced the truth
as a lie. He. was to be rewarded for
attacking General Miles with his pay dur
ing his suspension, calculating the "length
of his life according to recognized mor

SWAM THROUGH A
GALE-SWEPT SEA
Desperate Struggle of
Wrecked Men.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 10.â A ter
rible tale of the sea was brought to
this port to-day. It relates to the nar
row escape of four men from drowning
in English Bay, two miles from here,
and of the probable death of one of
them from the effects of his thrilling
experience. r
â¢ On Wednesday, last August Nelson
and. Peter and Ed Corfield of this city,
accompanied by a man named Oscar,
set out 'in a sixteen-foot* sailboat for
Eagle Harbor, up Howe Sound.** Little
wind was blowing, but quite a sea was
running and snow fell occasionally.
Corfield has a ranch at Eagle Harbor
and for this the four men were bound.
They ran out of the narrows with little
difficulty, but when between the Capl
lano and Pilot Cove a huge sea struck
the boat ' and it rapidly filled with
water.- Then a second and a third sea
dashed over the bow and the boat was
capsized about a quarter- of a mile from
shore. - > -â .* .;â¢â¢-.*.. *.-â¢, Ââ¢'.*.;" .*.;.. .
It was then dark and in the desperate
battle for* life- in the choppy sea the
wrecked ' men became separated. â¢'â¢ All
were powerful" swimmers, but the tide
was against them and when, after a
ions strut-rete - they fina'lv reached
long siruggre, - tney "*-*-â¢- , re__nea
shore, they were half dead from cold
and exhaustion. ,~ â¢;-
Peter -Corfield crawled up a steep'
bank and heard his friends ' shouting
for assistance out in the- water. ,He
could offer no help, and, as he thought,
left them to. their fate. Traveling all
night he found two of them the next
morning on a ranch up the coast, very
ill from their awful' experience.
Ed Corfield and Oscar were missing.
Search was made for them and Oscar
was discovered at noon lying in a shal
low stream in a ravine unconscious. He
recovered sufficiently to say that he
got separated from Ed Corfield on a
mountain side and then fell" down the
ravine, lying insensible from about 9
o'clock on Wednesday night until
found at noon the following day. : He
had struck a rock in his fajl and knew
nothing afterward.
Ed Corfield, Oscar thinks, strayed into
the mountains during the blinding
snowstorm and perished. Large search
ing parties were out ail day, but could
get no trace of the missing man. Search
will be resumed to-morrow, but the
friends of Corfield have given up hope.

PACIFIC CABLE IS

to Congress.,
URGES IMMEDIATE ACTION

" QUIRE . TWO YEARS.
Present Means of Communication
With Honolulu and Manila
. Are Wholly Inade
quate.
WASHINGTON, Feb.. 10.â Presi
dent's message on the Pacific cable,
transmitted to Congress to-day, is as
follows? ;v * .\ : ; :â¢ ' â " â  fx'-
As a consequence of the ratification of
the treaty of Paris by the Senate of the
United States and its expected ratification
by the Spanish Government, the United
States will come Into possession" of the
Philippine Islands, on the farther shores
of the Pacific. The Hawaiian Islands and
Guam being. United States territory and
forming convenient stopping places on the
way across the sea, the necessity for
speedy cable communication between the
United States and all the Philippine Isl
ands has become Imperative. Such com
munication should be established in such
a way as to be wholly under the control
of the United States, whether in time of
peace or war. At present the Philippines
can be reached only by cables which pass
through many foreign countries, and the
Hawaiian Islands and Guam can be only
communicated with by steamers, Involv
ing delays in each Instance of at least
a week. The present conditions should'
not be allowed to continue for a moment
longer than is absolutely necessary.
The time has now arrived when a ca
ble in the Pacific must extend as far as
Manila, touching at the Hawaiian Islands
and Guam on the way. Two methods of
establishing this cable communication at
once suggest themselves. First, construc
tion and maintenance of such a cable at
the expense of the United States Govern
ment, and, second, construction, and main
tenance of such a cable by a private Unit
ed States corporation under such a safe
guard as Congress shall Impose.
I do not make any recommendation to
Congress as to which of these methods
would be the more desirable. A cable of
the length of that proposed requires so
much time for construction " and laying
that it is estimated that at least two
years must elapse after giving the orders i
for the cable before the entire system
could be successfully laid and put in oper
ation. Further deep sea soundings must
be taken west of the Hawaiian Islands
before the best route can- be selected for
the cable. Under these circumstances, it
becomes a paramount necessity that
measures should be taken before the close
of the present Congress to provide such
means as may seem suitable for the es
tablishment of a cable system.
I recommend the whole subject to the
careful consideration of the Congress and
to such prompt action as may * seem ad
visable, William Mckinley.

APIA, Jan. 25, ISM.
I have returned to Apia four L weeks
sooner than I had intended, owing to the
dreadful state of affairs in 'Samoa again.
They were bad enough in 'SS and '88 buc
they are worse this time, owing to tli"
German side having been- victorious. . I
wonder how long America and "England
are going to allow Germany to make
fools of them? "V -,â¢.:â -.* -. .-.-â¢>â¢
The natives never went quite so far be
fore as they have done this time, and
with the next outbreak it is almost cer
tain that whites will be massacred. This
time they broke into several white men's
houses and stole everything, and what
was too large to carry they smashed. My
own house was treated in this manner
and not a single thing left in it. Even
my bed .and bedding, were" taken away;
the house was locked and it was. broken
Into and completely cleaned out. Har
per's house was treated In the same man
ner, so you see they had apparently i
particular grudge against the late United
States Consulate officials; perhaps tlvv
were getting even for the' part we took
'when they were following Tamasese," for
the present Mataafa followers .are the
late Tamasese gang. . . .........
The Germans have thrown this lat
ter chief ovey because he submitted to the
orders of the Supreme * Court, and have
taken up with Mataafa just to cause trou
ble in the country and get the whole. Sa
moan question opened again in the "hope
that they may fare better than* in "the
Berlin Conference, and, perhaps, get the
sole control, of Upolu. They have been
making themselves obnoxious in Tonga
as well during the last two months,' and
the German "Vice Consul went so far as
to threaten to hoist the German flag there
If the â¢ natives did not immediately pay
their debts to the German firms. My
idea is that they will demand that the
whole Pacific question be dealt with at
the same time and that by at first pres
sing their claims In Tonga and other
places they can eventually make way for
a bigger hold in Samoa, â¢ â¢â¢ â  'â "'*
I can't think what the officials were
thinking about in recognizing that" "pro
visional government." That was a very
weak step, I think. There should have
been an American man-of-war there - to

"Hudyan Cuned,"^^^^
SWAN RIVER, MINN.
Dear Doctors:â can never thank you enough for the great benefits I have
received from your wonderful remedy "Hudyan," after I had tried numerous
other remedies and several physicians, without good results. "Completely
run down" hardly expressed the condition I was in. I attributed my condi-
tion to the fact that my household duties were rather burdensome, owing to
the fact That I had a large family of v children and I was kept constantly busy
attending to their wants. 1 held out as long as I could, but I was finally
compelled to take to my bed, for I found it a great exertion to even remain
on my feet for any length of time. I had a constant severe backache and
headache and I was extremely nervous. The children's playing used to dis-
turb me, and I had to keep them out of doors during the day. I felt my
nerves giving away gradually, and I was afraid I would be paralyzed. (I for-
got to mention that my mother died from a paralytic stroke.)
I consulted several doctors and they all concluded that the weather was
too severe for me, and that it would be necessary for me to have a change of
climate. This I could not do. and. as the medicines they gave me had no ap-
fiarent effect I thought I would use "Hudyan." which seemed to be Indicated
n my case. I was not surprised at the result, because I felt certain that it
was going to help me, and It did, indeed. It not only nelped, it cured, for I
am now enjoying perfect health and can truthfully say I never felt better in
my life.
..gain thanking you for all the good that has been done me by the use of
Hudyan. and assuring you that I will recommend It to all my friends. I will
close. Sincerely yours, MRS. P. A. BUNER.
You can get "HUDYAN" from druggists at 50 cents a package, or 6
packages for $2.50. If your druggist does hot keep it. send direct to the

Francisco. Cal. x.

WASHINGTON,' Feb. 10.-Secretary
Gage, ii reply to the complaint of H. J.

vestigation into the explosion of the river
steamer T. C. Walker, has written as fol-
lows:
You are Informed that the investigation by
the local Inspectors into the causes of the ac
cident was held under authority conferred upon
them by the Revised Statutes of the United
States. The law only authorizes Inspectors to
Investigate casaultles to steamboats, their
hulls or boilers to the extent of determining
whether the casualty resulted from incom
petency or misconduct of licensed officers in
charge of the vessel, and if so found, to sus
pender revoke the license of the officer found
delinquent, other reasons for casualties than
those for which licensed officers may be found
responsible being Incidental only to such ; in
vftlfcationo. In the case under consideration
the inspectors holding the investigation found
evidence, in the shape of fusible plugs being
melted out. that water had been low in the
boiler on the occasion of the explosion, and
presumably was the cause thereof, while un

li same day his promised joy was turned to grief and pain. li
li Last Tuesday he called upon his lady love. While he was there S3
li she asked him to excuse her. as she desired to run up town and 82
ti wished him to look after her two-year-old girl while she was away. 88
li It transpired that during her absence Mr. de Lashmutt, tookocca- li

Portions of a Ballooo ; ar)d the
Bodies of Three Men Four)d
in North Siberia.
KRASNOYARSK, Siberia, Feb. 10.â gold-mine owner named
Monastyrachln has received a letter stating that a tribe of Turgesos,
inhabiting the Timur Peninsula, North Siberia, recently informed the
Russian Chief of Police of the district that on January 7 last, be
tween Komo and Pit, in the province of Yeniseisk, they found a
cabin constructed of cloth and cordage, apparently belonging to a
balloon. Close by were the bodies of three men, the head of one be
ing badly crushed. Around them were a number of instruments, the
uses of which were not understood by the Turgesos.
The Chief of Police has started for the spot to investigate, and it
is believed that the bodies are those of the aeronaut, Herr Andree,
and his companions.
The balloon Eagle, with Professor Andree and two companions,
Strlndeberge and Fronkel, in the car, left Danes Island, of the
Spitzbergen group, on July 11, 1897, in an attempt to cross the north
polar point. No definite news of the aeronauts has been received
beyond the message, attached to a carrier pigeon, found by the
whaling ship Falken, which arrived at Copenhagen on September 2.
The message read:. "July 13, 12:30 p. m., latitude 82.02 north, longi- .
tude 12.05 degrees east. Good voyage eastward. All well."

"ABSOLUTELY INNOCENT,"
DECLARES MR. MOLINEUX
His Answer to a Question Asked
Abruptly During the Adams
Inquest.
NEW TORK, Feb. 10.â The men whose
names have been most intimately con
nected with the death of Mrs. Kate J.
Adams were on the witness-stand to-day
before Coroner Hart and jury, and were
put through a rigid cross-examination by
Assistant District Attorney Osborne, who
Is conducting the case. Harry S. Cor
nish, who gave the poison to Mrs. Adams,
was the first witness called this morn
ing, and at the afternoon session B. Mol
ineux, who had been named by Cornish on
the stand as the man he believed to have
sent the poisoned bromo-seltzer through
the mails, was called.
Cornish was again to-day somewhat
reticent and equivocal in his answers to
questions put to him, and in one instance,
at least, occasioned a good deal of sur
prise. In an interview with a number
(#* newspaper reporters previous to the
commencement of the examination Cor
nish, when asked if he knew Mrs. Mol
ineux, and lf she could have had an In
terest in the case, said he wished
the Assistant- District Attorney would ask
him that question on the stand. "A man
is supposed to perjure himself for a
woman," said Cornish, "but I am here to
tell the truth If I am asked such a ques
tion."
This seemed a strange statement at the
time, and Assistant District Attorney Os
borne put those very questions to him.
to which Cornish made the answer, "I
never saw Mrs. Molineux to know her,
and never saw her when she was Blanche
Chesebrough."
"â¢â¢Cornish gave way on the #tand tempo
rarily to Molineux. Osborne asked the
witness abruptly lf he was Innocent of the
poisoning of Mrs. Adams. Ilolineux re
plied, "I "am absolutely Innocent."

MAY CLOSE THE SAN

Lack of Funds Due -to th. Methods
of the Board of Edu
cation.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 10.â Owing to lack of
funds it will be necessary to close the
High School nearly two months earlier
than usual. ' This is the direct result of
extravagance of the City Board of Edu
cation and Its manner of conducting the
school that led to a strike of the students
Over 130 High School students are now at
tending the High School at Santa Clara
There Is hardly enough money on hand to
conduct the school three months. On Feb
ruary 1 there was only $594 In the fund
To this can be added about $3800 that wfll
be received In the apportionment of State
funds and from rent of buildings, .his
makes $4400. From this amount $1700 must
be paid on the building, leaving only $2700
for carrying on the school. The monthly
cost bill is $960. so that this is not quit
enough for three months, and there will
be no schoo} in < May or June, unless the
teachers donate their services.
Last year over. $3000 was paid in tuition
fees by outside pupils, but the strike of
students drove ' these scholars to Santa

realized in the future, the Surplus Assets after deducting all liabilities, would be $34,902,400.
The Society holds a larger amount of Assets in excess of Total Liabilities than any other life
assurance company in the United States or Europe on similar computations.
All interest actually realized in excess of the rates assumed, will be added to surplus for the benefit
of policyholders.
An apportionment of profits will be made as usual to policyholders during the year 1899 in the
manner specified in their respective policies.

INCIDENTS OF THE DAY AT SACRAMENTO.
BURNS WILL FORCE
GOVERNOR GAGE
INTO OPEN SUPPORT
Latest Proclamation of the Mexican to His
Supporters..
JACKSON INSISTS ON A SELECTION
The Collector Wants Both the San Diegan and the Cande
larian to Get Out of the Way So That an Honest
and Clean Man May Be Chosen.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- ]
MENTO, Feb. 10.â Dan Burns has is
sued another proclamation to those of
his supporters whom he trusts with
such information as he sees fit to dole
out to the faithful. He is going to
force Governor Gage to come out open
ly in support of Burns' Senatorial can
didacy and by virtue of his position and
the power he wields as dispenser-in
thief of the State patronage club legis
lators into line for the Mexican.
So far in the Senatorial contest the
Governor's public attitude has been
that of an on-looker save in the case j
of U. S. Grant, against whom the Gov
ernor has openly declared war. While '
it is well known his sympathy is with j
Burns in the long-drawn-out contest !
the Governor has refrained from acting
openly in behalf of the railroad candi
date. Now that the statement comes
from the Burns camp that Gage is to
come out in the open and work for the
success of Burns' cause there is much
speculation as to how far he will go
in the abuse of the power that was
given him by the votes of the people
who are now opposed to Burns' elec
tion.
If he cares to do so he can veto every
measure introduced in the Legislature
by legislators who have up to the pres
ent time listened to the voice of their
constituents and declined to vote for
Burns. Such a course would very na
turally lead to one of two possible re
sults. Either a combination would be
formed sufficiently strong to pass meas
ures over the Governor's veto, or else
] the legislators would surrender and
j vote for Burns and by so doing saddle
! the State with a United States Senator
: who would be representative of the
very worst elements in the community.
State patronage would also be used
as a club to whip reluctant legislators
' into line for Burns and every one ask
ing for a share of the spoils of office
j would be plainly told that unless he
1 voted for Burns he would be overlooked
' in the distribution of the good things.
i All this, of course, will come to pass if
it is true, as is announced, that Burns
I has forced Governor Gage to come out
openly in his behalf, v :..
Since the beginning of the Senatorial
I contest it has been conceded that if it
became necessary to do so Burns had
, sufficient power over the Governor to
j force him to enter openly into the
! fight. It was thought, however, that
he would not care to use this power for
the reason that if he' did so he would
place the Governor in a humiliating
position. To do so would also bring
about a condition of things that would
almost certainly result in the defeat of
the Republican party at the next elec
tion. Burns' present position as re
gards the ultimate result of the Sena
torial contest is so desperate that he
must resort to desperate means if he
wishes to have a hope of winning. This
is given as a reason that he has at last
decided to put the Governor to the front
in the hope that by so doing he may
succeed in intimidating honest mem
bers of the Legislature who have de
clared they will never vote for him un
der any circumstances.
One more desperate effort will be
made by Colonel Burns to bring about
a caucus on the Senatorship. Some of
his closest friends now admit that the
chances of success in the caucus
"TOO MUCH JOKEI-TSOISr."

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY* 11, 1899.
6cheme are not promising, but they |
cannot tell him so, as the suggestion .
would be regarded as treason. Burns i
is relying to a large extent on railroad
influence to accomplish the lining-up '
for caucus of the members who are now
supporting Grant, Barnes and Bulla.
He has signified that something de- ,
cisive may be expected next Thursday.
Colonel J. P. Jackson. Collector of the
Port, who came here to break the dead
lock, is still in town and the lock is
not broken. Collector Jackson was told
yesterday that the lock could not be
broken until both Grant and Burns
were eliminated from the contest.
Burns was quoted as saying: "I will
not stand in the way of electing a Re
publican Senator when Grant is out of
the field."
The Collector replied: "If I could
I get authority from Colonel Burns to
promise that he would step aside in
the event of Grant stepping aside, a '
Senator could be elected in short or
der."
It is believed that Collector Jackson
I came to Sacramento at the suggestion
; of Senator Perkins, and It is surmised
j that the administration has conveyed
! to Senator Perkins a desire that a Re
| publican Senator should be chosen at
I this session of the California Legisla
ture. The Collector is in earnest and
emphatic in his declaration that a Sen- ,
ator must be elected. Speaking to
night on this topic, he said:
"The idea that eighty-five Republi-
I cans cannot agree to elect a Senator is
preposterous. An agreement must be
reached. The Republican party of Cal
ifornia will make such a demand for |
the election of a Senator that individ
uals will be compelled to stand aside."
The Collector has spoken to all the
candidates and conversed with many
Senators and Assemblymen. He finds
that the forces surrounding the several
candidates are crystallized and he is !
i arriving at the conclusion that Grant
and Burns must get out of the field
before a Senator can be elected. He
i expects that candidates will ultimately
consent to the sacrifice of individual
I aspirations to promote the good of the
i party organization.

GREEN STILL TOO
ILL TO APPEAR
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â The Call of this
morning stated would be the case, Milton
J. Green did not appear this afternoon
before th*? bar of the Assembly. The re
port turned ln by the selected committee
which was appointed to call upon him
and examine into his condition apparently
satisfied every- member on the floor that
Mr. Green had been really ill, so when
the matter came up this afternoon as the
special order a motion by Dibble of San
Francisco put the whole matter over un
til next Friday afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
Assemblyman Brown of San Mateo, who
on Wednesday introduced a resolution to
declare Green guilty of contempt and
turn him over into the custody of the ser
geant at arms, to be confined in the
County Jail, called upon the chair to have
his resolution reread and then asked
unanimous permission to withdraw it. He
was satisfied, he said, that Mr. Green was
too ill to come before the House, and be
ing so incapacitated was of course guilty
of no contempt. in. falling to appear. The
consent was given and the resolution
withdrawn. The Assembly will wait now
for an announcement from Dr. Hatch
that Green Is well enough to be out, when
an hour will be set for him to appear and
give cause why he should not be punished.

REFORMERS AT WORK
IN THE ASSEMBLY
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â Grovel Johnson offered
in the Assembly to-day a bill which re
peals the law of 1872 requiring plaintiffs
in libel suits to give a bond of $500 upon
filing complaint. A similar bill was intro
duced earier in the session, but a number
of defects were discovered ln It, and the
bill introduced to-day is designed to cover
them. â¢-â¢â ,.'
A petition from the residents of Sausa
lito was read In the Assembly this morn
ing and ordered printed the journal. It
recited the fact that the people of the
pool-ridden summer resort were watching
with interest, the anti-pool-selling bill In
troduced ln the Assembly by Atherton
of Marin County, and prayed that the As
sembly pass the bill and do everything
in its power to assist in its becoming the
law of the State.
The much petitioned for Sunday law
was a matter of some discussion during
the day. Since the session opened peti
tions have been pouring in from every
county in the State asking that the Legis
lature enact some law which would pre
vent the Indulgence In sports and pas
times of any nature on Sunday, and which
would as well close every business house.
Nearly all of the members, however, re
fused to have anything to do with the
bill that was proposed unless it was
amended In many of its important fea
tures. To-day there has been a caucus of
ministers, headed by Rev. Dr. McLean,
of Oakland, considering the bill and draft
ing amendments that will fit it for legis
lative enactment. * â  \ â¢ y
FIGURING ON THE
1 SUCCESSOR OF COOMBS
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â The politicians are
already figuring on who is to succeed
Frank L. Coombs as State Librarian when
he assumes offlce as United States Dis
trict Attorney. ;.. It j has been stated that
Frank D. Ryan, one of the present Li
brary Trustees, can have the place if he
wants it, but Ryan, it is said, prefers
to stick to his law practice, which he has
been building up since his defeat by Ma
rlon de Vries for Congress. Jacob H. Neff,
another of the trustees, is expected to re
sign before the close of the legislative ses
sion, and his retirement may upset pres
ent guesses as to Coombs* successor. Be
sides Ryan and Neff, the trustees are
Allen B. Lemmon, Bradner W. Lees and
Thomas Flint Sr. Lee, it is well known,
will support the candidacy of William W.
Seaman of Los Angeles, the present chief
deputy. Other candidates are Talbot H.
Wall's and James L. Gillls.
| The hand of Dan Burns is already ap
parent in the contest, and no surprise
need be felt if the position is juggled with
ln order to bolster up Burns' fences. Gov
ernor Gage will, of course, be obedient
when the ambitious colonel decides what
he wants, and the influence of the admin
istration will be brought Into service to
advance the interests of the Senatorial
candidate through the medium of State
Library patronage. , Gage no doubt - will
base some hopes on the passage of the
bill now before the Legislature taking
the appointment of State Library Trus
tee out of the hands of the Legislature
and giving it to the Governor. Under the
present law the trustees are appointed
by the houses of the Legislature in joint
session every four years. The unexpired
portion of Coombs' term covers a period
of three years from April next. The posi
tion carries with it a salary of $3000 a year
and the duties have never been regarded
as of such a character as to make the
incumbent prematurely gray.
AN EFFORT TO
SUPPLANT SHIELDS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â Jesse D. Carr, of Sali
nas, an old warhorse of the Democratic
party, was here several days this week.
He expressed sympathy with the Sena
torial aspirations of M. M. Estee and
Irving M. Scott,' and even went to the
extent of predicting that Democratic
votes would be cast for either one should
it be shown that only a few more votes
would be required to elect. The Senator
ship, however, was not the subject that
called the veteran to this city. He came
here to recommend five men to fill pros
pective vacancies on the State Board of
Agriculture.
Mr. Carr Is very anxious that Ed Smith
should be reinstated as Secretary of the
board, and fancies that such a result
might be accomplished if Governor Gage
would consent to appoint men favorable
to the cause of Smith. The veteran Dem
ocrat from Salinas was introduced to the
Governor by a friend of both, and the re
sult of the Introduction was a long con
ference and the submission of the names
of the men recommended by Mr. Carr.
Peter J. Shields, the present secretary
of the board, was elected by the votes
of Trustees J. W. Wilson. W. P. Mat
thews, A. B. Spreckels, Park Henshaw,
Frank Covey, John Mackey and A. W.
Barrett. The board consists of twelve di
rectors, and it requires seven to elect 'or
displace a secretary. Of the seven that
voted for Mr. Shields, only one Is to retire
by reason of the expiration of his term
of service, and that one is John Mackey.
It is not supposed that Governor Gage
would enter into a combine to dispense
GAGE GROWS FACETIOUS
AT THE STATE'S EXPENSE
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO, ***. 10.â Governor
Gage submitted his first veto message to the Legislature to-day.
It is given here in full, so that the people of the State, and par
ticularly those who are interested in the principal industry of
California, may judge for themselves how well the Governor* is carry
ing out his ante-election promises by which he obligated hirnsef to do
all things that are necessary to promote the interests of the people.
It may be stated that the sum of $10,000. is the exact amount a gen
erous people have allowed the Governor each year to expend in any way
he may see fit even to pocketing the entire amo _r_tâ requir
ing him to render an accounting for the same. The; message is as fol
lows:
"The sum of $10,000, required by this bill to be .appropriated 'for the
purpose of sending an expert to Australia, New Zealand, or other coun
tries to collect and import into this State parasites j and predaceous in
sects,' is altogether excessive; and, moreover, Ido at perceive any ur
gent need at the present time for such an expedition.
"The purpose of this expedition to all quarters of the earth for un
discovered bugs is not apparent. The special quail of the parasites
and predaceous insects desired are not specified in' the bill, so that it
is impossible to determine whether they are designed to prey upon the
parasites which infest trees, beasts, poultry, or some men.
"The appropriation of so much money for so indefi-jite a purpose
should under no circumstances be permitted.
"Even should such a tour of investigation prove to be necessary
(and I personally do not think so) this bill calls for an immediate ap
propriation of money from the general fund of the present fiscal year.
In my inaugural address I called the attention of your honorable*' body ,
to the vice of such legislation requiring immedia-t* â  appropriations,
thereby tending to deprive the government of money needed to pay ac
crued demands and its current expenses. HENKY T. GAGE.
"Governor of the Stat*, of California,"
with the services of so valuable a man
as John Mackey in order to make Ed
Smith, secretary of the board. Should
Mackey not be reappointed and a sup
porter of Smith be named in his place
there would not then be seven votes to re
move Mr. Shields. *
A very strong effort was put forward to
induce Mr. Covey to vote for the retention
of Ed Smith. Among the elements of pres
sure in this direction was a personal let
ter from D. M. Burns.
Brakebeam Riding a Crime.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â Assemblyman Milice
introduced in the Assembly to-day a bill
by which the Southern Pacific will be en
abled to turn Its "cellar berths" to profit
and charge the hobo a modest trifle for
riding on a brake beam or taking a chance
on top of the vestibule of its overland
sleepers.
Heretofore all the satisfaction the
Southern Pacific has got out of the bum
caught riding in the steerage has been in
having him kicked off by some burly
brakey, or in the absence of the conduc
tor compelling him to give up to the crew
any loose change he might have in his
clothes, for the privilege of staying where
he was. There was no charge upon which
he could be arrested, but that is all
changed under the bill offered by Mr.
Milice. Riding on the brake beam of any
car is considered as trespassing, and as
such may be punished. Every engineer,
fireman and conductor Is made a police
Officer, with power to arrest th*.- cellar
tourist. In fact, the bill goes furtherâ it
provides that train crews must arrest
such offenders or themselves be punished.
Any brakeman found taking money from
any one beating his way over a road
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Â»'-

construction of the school buildings. Tha
land on which it is to build is to be do
nated by the city of San Francisco. Ex-
Jadge M. H. Cooney appeared before tha

CAUL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â Governor Gage's treat
ise on predaceous and affinitive and non
affinfctive Inserts was not the only veto
messSige that "Mysterious" Foley, his sec
retary, carted into the Assembly chamber
this afternoon. The Governor objected
also to Assembly bill 69. which was de
signed to give the guardian greater, power
and authority over the estate of his ward.
Concerning his reasons for disapproving
the measure the Governor 'had this to
say:
"In the history of guardianship in our
State experience has shown that much
waste and extravagance nave occurred,
notwithstanding the present restraints
which the law imposes. To remove tnesa
restraining provisions by giving to tae
guardian such extensive control over tna
property of the ward would be perilous
to the estates of minors and insane per
sons.
"It appears to me that the helpless
wards should be protected by legislation
limiting, rather than increasing, the pow
ers of guardians."VAST BEQUEST

The measures for the benefit of the
institution have been presented in the
Senate by Morehouse of Santa Clara
and are in the form of amendments to
the political code allowing corporations
formed for educational purposes to ac
cept gifts and bequests. When the bills
; finally become laws ; Mrs. Stanford
stands ready to turn over her own per
sonal fortune of over $5,000,000 to the
college, and Governor Stanford's
brother, who has made a tremendous
fortune in Australia, will turn over in
installments nearly $15,000,000 more.
This vast sum, with the present funds
at the disposal of the college, will place
it on a financial standing far beyond
its competitors. . ./'/.' ';â¢*.'
Under the present provisions of the
codes an educational institution can
not accept a gift or bequest. It was the
intent of the law to prevent * certain
eleemosynary institutions from securing
possession of large tracts of land and
sums of money and hold them with no
benefit to any one, and so when it was
desired to endow the university with
all the Stanford millions it was found
to be impossible to do so under the laws
of the State. It was about a year ago
when the Australian Stanford first
broached the subject of adding his mil
lions to those of his brother. It had al
ways been Governor Stanford's wish
that his childless and kinless brother
should follow his example regarding the
university, and a year ago it was de
cided to bring the two fortunes to
gether. -<;;..''_
Senator Morehouse's first bill was in- :
troduced in the Senate toward the lat
ter part of January. It amended the
code so as to allow educational institu
tions to accept gifts and grants and
j bequests in the same manner as cor
i porations organized for other purposes.
; A second bill provided for the forma
; tion of a trust by which funds so be
j queathed or granted could be controlled.
J A third bill, introduced this afternoon,
| provides that no charitable, benevolent
I or educational institution shall be al- ,

FRANK L. COOMBS
TO SUCCEED FOOTE
The New United States Attorney for the
Northern District of California.
FRANK L. COOMBS of Napa, at present State Librarian, has been ap
pointed by President McKinley United States District Attorney for the
Northern District of California to succeed Henry S. Foote, whose term
of office expires on the 20th inst. Mr. Coombs will assume his new
duties as soon as his appointment is confirmed by the Senate and his
. bond is sent to Washington and approved. â¢'-' >?u *.:.;
Frank L. Coombs is probably one of the most popular as well as one
of the moÃt prominent young Republicans in the State of California. He
was born in Napa County, December 27, 1853, and educated in the county
schools. He was graduated at the Columbia Law School in Washington,
D. C., and served twice as District Attorney of Napa County. He has been
a member of the California Legislature four times and has twice been
Speaker of . the Assembly, his first election to the -Assembly being in 1887
and his selection as Speaker in 1891. Upon the demise of John F. Swift,
who was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the court of
Japan, Mr. Coombs was appointed to serve the unexpired term. Recogniz
ing the splendid ability shown by Mr. Coombs as Minister to Japan, Presi
dent McKinley, when Mr. Coombs' name was suggested to him for that mis
sion, said that if the appointment came to the Pacific Coast Mr. Cooms
would be the appointee. .' â¢â â  7*7 ,; ~ .7^772,74, 2 -*â . â ';â  -"ixSx
As a member of the Legislature Mr. Coombs has done much to distin
guish himself. His efforts were directed as Speaker to crush out corrup
tion and dishonesty and to raise the tone and morale of the Legislature.
It has also been Mr. Coombs' effort to concentrate certain commissions,
abolish the useless ones and reduce the system of government to an econom
ical basis. His appointment as State Librarian on March 2, 1898, was un
solicited by him and made, without his knowledge.
This new honor conferred meets with unexceptional approval, and his ser
vice in every other position has won for him so much credit that it is safe
to prophesy a successful administration of his new office.

tablished one precedent to-day by
breaking down another, i By a half
hour's work on the official typewriter
and a, sweep of the gubernatorial pen
he repudiated contracts made in good
faith by his predecessor in office and.
as Governor and chairman of the State
Board of Examiners, disallowed $69,000
in claims against the State for the ad
vertising of: the constitutional amend
ments upon which the people were
called to vote at the late election.
For the specified time previous to the
last election a number of the news
papers of the State published all of
the constitutional" amendments that
were to be voted upon by the people.
A large number * of the publications
.were authorized by Governor Budd and
a large number were printed without
any authorization at all. All of these
claims have lately come before the
Board of Examiners, and whether au
thorized or not, the whole lot were to
day disallowed.- \
Governor Gage bases his action upon
a unique construction of the law in
the case. Sections 1194 and 1195 of the
Political Code originally provided that
a copy of the ballots to be used at the
next following election and copies of
all the . amendments to .be voted unon
should be published in a number of the
newspapers of the' State having general
circulation. In 1893 section 1194 was so
amended that the Secretary of State
was required to have â copies ; of the
ballot printed and sent to every elector
in the State instead of publishing them
in the newspapers, but section 1195. re
lating to the amendments, was not
touched, however, and in passing upon
the claims of that year Governor Budd
decided that the amendment of the
first section â  affected . in no â  way the
latter. -.* Governor Gage, however, de
cided v differently. If section, 1194 was
amended, figures he, so, of course, was
section. 1195. ,*-"hls at any rate is his
excuse,' but' his hand shows in his ' rec
ommendation to the Legislature that
when it passes upon the claims" each
bill be sent back to him separately for
his -â¢ viae. â¢â¢ : Such jj a suggestion - smells
rather of politics than economy., ,
His * mess&ge on â¢ that matter -which
created a good deal of comment, is as

other newspaper claims of different sums
in all aggregating upward of $69,000
These ' C & have all been disallowed

the board, they were not authorized by

BIG EXPOSITION
BILLS INTRODUCED
Two Measures Before the Legis
lature That Mean Much v
for the State.
- CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO,' Feb. 10.â Charles L. Patton
and the. delegation that 'has come 'up
here to secure an appropriation of $500,
--000 to help out in the big project for a
"Pacific Ocean and International Ex
position" in 1901, got the bills they
.brought with them introduced in ' the
Assembly this afternoon. I They . were
offered out of order by Assemblyman
Cobb of San Francisco and j referred at
once to the Committees ; on Municipal
, Corporations and Ways and Means.
The first bill, which went to 'the Mu
nicipal Corporations Committee, pro
vides that every county, 'city or city and
county is empowered to appropriate
from the general fund for the purpose
of advancing and maintaining their in
terests by exhibit at the "Pacific Ocean
and International Exposition," to be
held in San Francisco in 1901, such sums
of money as may be determined.
The bill further provides that to raise
the necessary cash counties and cities
may include the exposition fund in the
tax ]%vies of the different counties, pro
vided that the amount so collected shall
be appropriated one-third in each of the
three fiscal years 1899-1900, 1900-1901 and
1901-1902.
The intent of the bill is to give every
county in the State an opportunity, to
come into the scheme and participate
in the exposition to the extent of their
resources.
. The second bill offered asks the State
.itself to do its share toward the con
summation of the stupendous project.
It asks outright for an appropriation of
$500,000 and calls upon the Governor
to appoint within thirty days after the
passage of the act fifteen commission
ers, who shall be known as the "Pacific
Ocean and International Exposition
Commission." The commission shall
have charge and control of all expendi
tures of money appropriated by the
State and the erection of all buildings
and maintaining the exposition. Each
commissioner shall give a bond of $20,
--000 for the faithful performance of his
duties, each bond to be approved by
the Governor. They shall receive no
compensation for their services, and
Charles L. Patton says there are 20,000
able men in the State who will serve
willingly at the price.
The last bill went to the Ways and
Means Committee, which, : it is said,
will Jbe unanimous in giving it favor
able recommendation.
The San Francisco delegations to
both Senate and Assembly met jointly
to-day after the Senatorial ballot and
talked the matter over with Mr. Patton
and Supervisor Lackmann, who told
them â  just what the promoters of the
exposition want. Every member of the
two delegations. Republican and Demo
crat, gave his vote heartily to stand be
hind the scheme and see it through to
a successful issue. _ 7-72 2' â

People don't need bathrooms, as this

bath tubs have been discarded since tue
invention of this Cabinet, as it gives a
far better bath for all cleansing purposes
than soap and water. For the sick room
its advantages are at once apparent. The
Cabinet is amply large enough for any
person. There have been

On the market, but they were unsatis-

porting frame, but were simply a cheap
affair to pull jon or off over, the head
like a skirt or barrel, subjecting me
body to sudden and dangerous changes
of temperature, or made with a bulky
wooden frame, which the heat and steam
within the Cabinet warped, cracked and
caused to fall apart and soon become
worthless.

cinnati firm is the only practical article
of its kind, and will last for years. It

JUNKETING TRIPS WILL
BE THE RULE NOW
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â A delegation from the
â Assembly Committee on Ways and Means
left this morning on a junketing trip
through the entire State, to be gone prob
ably for the better part of the next week,
and to-morrow morning the Committee on
Public Buildings will leave almost in its
entirety for San Francisco, where it will
examine the Affiliated Colleges and other
public buildings in that city belonging to
the State. The committee will also go to
Berkeley to Inspect. the State University
and to look over the site of the improve
ments proposed at that place.
- -To-morrow night it will take the train
for lone, where it will be met on Monday
morning by the Committee on State
Prisons and Reformatories. Both of the
committees are considering bills relating
to the needs of the Preston Reform School
at that town, and their trip is with these
measures in view. The Ways and Means
Committee, which left' to-day, proposes
also to drop in on lone and then will pro
ceed to the Whittier Reform School In the
southern part of the State.
â  Next week's mileage bills bid ' fair to
stack up to a considerable figure. Every
committeeman gets 10 cents a. mile going
and coming. Of course, the distances axe
fixed by the statutes, but the statutes are
generous in these matters, and there is
generally left a fat bit of profit. Assembly
man Mellck this morning tried to amend
the statutes and effect more or less econ
omy by a simple resolution. He offered
one, which provided that hereafter on
junketing trips members and the accom
panying clerks . should be allowed only
their actual traveling expenses, providing
that the entire expense did not exceed 10
cents per mile. It also required junketing
committeemen to hand in with their ex
pense claims itemized accounts of every
cent spent. When it came to a vote the
entire House landed on it. and It did not
take a minute to beat it beyond recogni
tion.; â -â â¢-.-' Â.-.,

*- : HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS.
ASSEMBLY BILL 568 is one of the educational
measures before the Legislature which merits
general support, inasmuch as it provides a
much needed reform in our system of certificating
High School teachers. Under its provisions "there".
will be a uniform standard of examination required
.for obtaining such certificates in place of the, vague
and indefinite standard, or lack of standard, now pre
vailing.
'Â At the present time there are two methods by which
..aspirants may obtain certificates qualifying them to
.receive appointments as High School teachers. Any
graduate of the State University, recommended by
': the faculty, or a graduate of. any other institution of
'.education in the United States indorsed by the State
Board of Education as of equal rank with the State
'University, may receive the High School certificate
Without examination. All other candidates for such
.certificate's must pass an examination conducted by
a county Board of Education.
In the first method of, obtaining a certificate the
â¢proposed reform makes no alteration. Graduates of
the university will, retain the privilege now accorded
them. It is with that class of candidates for certifi
cates* who obtain them by passing examinations the
measure deals, and its object is to substitute for the
county Boards of Education a central State board as
the ' examining body before which all aspirants for
.' High School certificates are to appear.
There are upward of 120 High Schools in Califor
nia, employing over 500 teachers. For the examina
tion* of candidates for this service there are fifty-seven
county Boards of Education, each with its own. stan
dard of qualification, and in many counties the stan
dard is fixed by examiners who themselves could not
meet the requirements of a High School teacher.
Here is clearly an evil demanding a remedy, and it is
to provide such that the bill under consideration has
been devised.
The measure proposes the establishment of a High
School Commission, the members of which are to
serve without pay. The commission is to be com
posed* of the State Superintendent of Public Instruc
. tion, the president of the University of California,
. and the professor of pedagogy of that institution, to
gether with three persons chosen from among the
".High School principals and city School Superin
tendents. This commission is to conduct all ex
aminations of candidates for High School . teachers,
and the successful candidates will receive credentials :
on which county Boards of Education will grant cer
tificates.
The measure, it will be seen, establishes uniformity
where there is now confusion, and provides a well
â¢ ordered way by which persons who are not graduates
. of the university may enter the High School service.
â¢It will save the expense of fifty-seven separate county
examinations and promises" in other ways to prove
, beneficial to both the teachers and the schools.

will do more harm than good. If a man who must
have a ride can steal the price as safely as he can the
ride itself, he will merely switch his larcenous pro
clivities so as to grasp the price. And, after all, the
theft of a ride does not make anybody any poorer.

IMPERIALIST DISCORDS.
THE Democratic organ of imperialism here, the
Examiner, some months ago laid down, the law
less line to be followed in the statement that ex
ternal colonial government would be carried on by
the United States outside of any and all limitations of
the constitution. This doctrine has been accepted as
correct by imperialists in the Senate, 1 who declare
that the constitution of the United States _is for' the
people of the United States alone, and that none of
its provisions need be projected to external territory
or people gained and governed by the United States
as a sovereignty. This doctrine we accept also as
correct. It permits in our external possessions any
method or measure of power that Russia or any
other, sovereignty, may exercise. It removes, all bar
riers, breaks down all limitations, equalizes and there
fore destroys all checks and balances, and permits one
policy in one place and its direct opposite in another.
The people so governed have no rights, fixed and
chartered and made inviolable by fundamental law.
They become the subject of experiment in govern
ment, which in the midst of them becomes entirely
empirical and autocratic.
But when we apply this statement of policy which
is accepted by the imperialists the Post, the Repub
lican organ of imperialism, flinches. When we call
attention to the existence in the Philippines of poly
gamy and involuntary servitude, the Post proceeds
to hallow plural marriage as a religious institution
protected by the constitution, which forbids a reli
gious test for holding office, and also forbids invol
untary servitude within the jurisdiction of the United
States.
Hence it appears that the Democratic and Repub
lican wings of imperialism â¢ refuse to flop together.
If all constitutional limitations stop, cease and die
at the border line of the United States, it is difficult
to see how the Post can extend constitutional pro
tection to Philippine polygamy and constitutional
prohibition to Philippine slavery, if it exist!
Inasmuch as the Post raises this very interesting
question, and thereby materially increases the confu
sion of counsel in the imperialist camp by insisting
that polygamy as a domestic and religious institution
is outside the constitutional reach of this Govern
ment, it is worth while to inquire into the supreme
law of the land on that subject... The constitution re
cites that it, and the laws and treaties made in con
formity to it, shall be the supreme law of the land-
On July 16, 1894, Congress passed a law,' chapter
-138 statutes 'at large of the Fifty-third Congress,
providing for the. admission of Utah as a State. In
that act it is recited that the Utah constitution must
be "republican in form * * * and not repugnant
to the constitution "of the United States and the prin
ciples of the Declaration of Independence. And said
convention shall provide, by ordinance irrevocable
without the consent of the United "States and the
people of said State, that perfect toleration of reli
gious' sentiment shall be secured, and that no inhab
itant of said State shall ever be molested in person
or property on account of his or her mode of reli
gious worship: Provided, that polygamous or
plural marriages are forever prohibited." ; , ;'â¢;
From this it appears that, standing upon a prin
ciple inherited in the constitution, this Government
has the power to prohibit polygamy in the -United
States, and used that power and prohibition over
Utah as a precedent condition to her entry into the
Union,- * â  .
Yet the Post says that 'we cannot prevent -a
Mahometan from holding, office in the United
States, though he have the' full allowance of four
wives lavishly permitted by the Koran.' ' From this
we gather that the Post regards polygamy as a reli
gious institution of Islam. But we wish to inquire
by what test the Post has determined . that
Mahomet, the son of Abdallah, was any better
prophet of the Lord than Joseph Smith, son of Bill
Smith, the Vermont farmer who sowed his rye with
a shotgun in the steep sides of the Green Moun
tains. Â« â  â¢ â "
It is a day of commissions and inquisitions. How
can we prohibit polygamy in one place, taught as a
religious ordinance, and permit it in another be
cause the constitution forbids a religious test? It is
easy to see that an eminent commission must be ap
pointed to report on Mahometanism and Mormonism
and determine which permits many wives for God's
sake and which wants a lot of them out of mere
deviltry.
THE TRIPLE HAMMER.
THE treaty of Paris escaped defeat by the skin
of its teeth. Under the enormous â¢ pressure
brought to bear upon the Federal Senate -one
vote would have changed the result. Had Senator
Perkins followed his own convictions instead of a
void instruction, it would have been beaten in fact as
it was beaten in principle. Other Senators voted for
the treaty with the distinct understanding that the ad
ministration did not propose to hold the Philippines
longer than was necessary for the fulfillment of a
moral obligation, that exists only ir- the imagination
o . ( those who look toward sentiment and row toward
revolution.
The adoption of the treaty, therefore, was no vic
tory for imperialism or annexation. On the con
trary, it indicated the growth of public opinion
against both forms of treason to the constitution, The*
treaty itself settles nothing in respect to the Philip
pines, except the payment of twenty millions for a'
fictitious title, unaccompanied by .possession, and
which originated in the exploded fallacy of a divine
vicegerency, parceled out among the holders of
monarchical baubles. Yet the New York Herald and
the New York Journal and the San Francisco Ex
aminer sound a peal of triumph and misrepresent the
treaty by declaring that it represents unanimous
American sentiment, and The Call by asserting that
its opposition to imperialism and annexation sprang
from its relation to the domestic manufacture of re
fined sugar.
The Journal and the Examiner resemble a rattle
snake cut in two. The head is raised and the forked
tongue spits in New York, while the tail feebly rattles
in. San Francisco. Those papers are so demented
through egotism that their "national policy" has be T
come the laughing stock of America. ' â¢''â .'â¢
The Herald, with a splendid news service that con
serves its circulation and its advertising patronage,
upon the question of imperialism and. annexation
does not speak for American public opinion.: Many
years ago it supported Walker , and the ether fili
busters who tried to place our country in the attitude
of violating the eighth and the tenth commandments.
It has drifted into an attitude more European than
American. Its views on the result of the "war; with
Spain are unmistakably hostile to our system of gov
ernment and harmonize with those of the gamblers,
the speculators, the unclean combinations, the. "as
pirants for military glory, who seek to use false views
of; trade and commerce to benefit themselves and to
extinguish the sentiment of American nationality
upon a. constitutional basis. -; v _ ; \" 2 â

J I 'HE act of 1872 was a protection not only to
THE newspapers a protection not districts,
the newspapers published in country districts,
* but to, the mass of citizens. It required an un
dertaking in the sum of five hundred dollars in ac
tions to recover damages for alleged slanders, as well
as in libel cases. Prior to its passage the most
trivial slanders were made the basis of claims for
'damages, that were usually speculative, and the pro
ceeds of which, in the event of recovery, were custom
arily divided between plaintiffs and a disreputable
class of attorneys, who. in this way fomented un
necessary litigation and made business for them
selves. Since the necessity for a bond attached a
genuine responsibility .to .the commencement of ac
tions of this character, the courts throughout the
State have been virtually relieved from this species
of gambling on verdicts, which consumed much time
and money and was a vexation to reputable and re
sponsible citizens.
The constitutionality of .the act of 1872 was ques
tioned by the Supreme Court itself in the case of
Smith vs. McDermott, and after full arguments, both
orally and in briefs, and much consideration, was up
held by that tribunal. The law, therefore, has been
firmly knit into the "jurisprudence of the State, and
its beneficial results, after the experience of twenty-six
years, have been proved beyond question. Its
repeal under the pretext of increasing the
.liability of newspaper, proprietors and* protecting the
reputation of citizens would be ! a serious injury to
the public, and could have no other effect than to re
vive and Enlarge'; a' kind of -litigation against which
the best lawyers and [ the, best judicial officers in the
State unanimously protest. Most * newspapers are
extremely conservative, and seldom attack personal
reputation unless sure of their facts, for justifiable
ends, arid,- actuated by good motives. Neither they
nor individual citizens should be wantonly exposed to
pettifogging and mercenary raids. Every man should
be adequately protected in all his rights, including his
reputation," but the liberty and the independence of
the press, maintained in England during the last cen
tury after one of the most memorable struggles of
modern times, are equally essential in the United
States, and are the best means "of insuring this pro
tection. A free press and- free citizens can exist to
gether in harmony and in â  safety, * but while . freedom
should not degenerate into license, it should not be
restricted by irresponsible licentiousness. A roving
privilege to manufacture a simulate- reputation
through courts and juries is only .â desired, by men
without character or industry, and who are the cor
rupt and .vicious elements in society. Any citizen,
poor or rich, whose reputation has been maliciously
impeached, whether in writing or orally, and whose
standing has an actual moneyed value, if he feels
called upon to sue can easily find two sureties in the
county where he resides, each of whom .is able and
willing to qualify to the amount of five hundred dol
lars. A litigant who cannot meet 'this requirement is
bankrupt in the estimation of his fellow-men, and
should not be permitted to speculate upon verdicts.
The passage of Senate bill 386 .is not demanded by
public sentifnent, and the bill is only one of the in
numerable devices to place good*citizenship and prop
erty at the mercy of the worthless and the undeserv
ing, and to swell the voluAe of trashy and congesting
lawsuits,, of -which there are already too many, at the
expense of enterprise, labor and capital.
FOR THE ISOLATION OF LEGISLATORS
\A R. Dll B BLE: has introduced into the Assem
/ \ bly a bill which declares, "It shall be unlaw
.. * ful for any person, either individually or as an
officer or member of any committee or association,
to demand or solicit of any candidate for the-Legis
lature that he shall vote for or against any particular
bill or specific "measure that may come before the
Legislature, or . or or against any particular person
for the office of Senator in the Congress of the
United- States," and so on and so forth, etc., for- sev
eral varieties of specifications.
Under this bill, should it become a law, no person
can be pledged to anything except what is in his
party platform. No citizen can suggest anything to
a candidateâ in fact, hardly talk to him on any
subject connected with politics even in the most in
direct way. Platforms are long and wide, but they
do not cover everything in sight, and.the man who
should ask a candidate to stand in for a local measure
or some reform overlooked by the platform makers
would be a violator of the law and subject to con
dign punishment. : .
It is a bill to put a padlock on the mouths of men
and; women from the. time nominations are made un
til the campaign ends. Woe be to the thoughtless
citizen who talks to a candidate upon even the most
trivial subject, with this inhibition hanging over him.
{Public-spirited reformers who wish some evil cor
rected, if they speak to. a candidate must go to jail.
Temperance folks who wish a liquor law ; go to jail.
Single-taxers with their theories -go to jail. Citizens
who wish an appropriation . for an exposition go to
jail. Ladies who would like to get a support for
woman's suffrage go to jail. Cattlemen who wish
a quarantine : law go to jail. Preachers who wish a
Sunday law. go to jail. Even the wife of the candi
date's bosom who should express a sweet feminine
caprice as to the need of reform goes to jail. 7. ..
â¢ Dibble asks too much. . Why. padlock, the public?
Why send all the world to jail? It would be easier
and better to provide that as soon as a man is nomi
nated for the' Legislature he shall beat once conveyed
to San Quentin and kept in close confinement where
; no one can speak to him until after election.

Special Committee for * *
Sacramento. , â¢' r '
The California Water and Forest So
ciety, which is an outgrowth of the re
cent miners' convention, through Its ex
ecutive | committee, transacted important
business at its meeting yesterday after
noon. A few days ago a special commit
tee went to Sacramento to ascertain Gov
ernor Gage's sentiment toward the move
ment for the ' conservation of the waters
and forests of the State. Their request
for an , audience was answered by the
statement that they would be granted fif
teen minutes. At the expiration of an
hour and a quarter the committee arose,
but the Governor asked them to remain
and further elaborate their proposition.
The outcome of the conference was the
announcement by the executive that the
enterprise would have his hearty support
and furthermore that he would send I a
special message to the Legislature advo
cating the passage of the measure pro
posed by the society. V, . i.
The legislation which is thus called for
provides for the appointment of a Com
missioner of Irrigation, whose duty it
shall be to co-operate with the United
States Geological Survey in surveys
and estimates of cost of reservoirs for
storing flood waters for irrigation, min
ing and industrial purposes. It is stipu
lated that the commissioner shall receive
no salary and that he Is to hold offlce
at the .pleasure of the Governor. The
measure, however, calls for the appro
priation of $10,000, to be distributed
through the hands of the Commissioner
of Irrigation, on the approval of the State
Board of Examiners, with the under
standing that the United States Geological
Survey will expend an equal sum in con
nection with said work.
Another provision of the proposed law
is that a commission be appointed for the
purpose ot devising means to preserve the
Wrests of the State from destruction by
fires and wanton depredation; and to re
port to the Governor the result of their
labors. A striking feature of the desired
act is the provision that until such com
.mission shall have reported to the Gov
ernor upon the matters intrusted to their
care no legislative action shall be taken
toward the acceptance of the proposed
donation by Congress of a million acres
of arid lands. * , . '*â¢"_-''
In accordance with a resolution embrac
ing the foregoing propositions, offered by
ex-Judge C. H. Lindley, a committee was
appointed, consisting of President J. M.
Gleaves, Chairman J. M. Availing of the
executive committee and C. H. Lindley,
John P. Irish and Julian Sonntag, to -pro
ceed, to Sacramento on next . Thursday
and submit to Governor Gage the draft
of the bill embodying the requirements
of the society. '" -
Notwithstanding the fact that the bill
will be an administration measure, It Will
be a part of, the duties of . the committee
to .convince skeptical members of the
Legislature of the necessity to take fa
vorable action on the matter. Another
task with which the committee is In
trusted is the promotion of an act to re
peal a certain statute created by the last
legislature â¢in the *' Interest of private
parties. Through the provisions of this
aw water rights have been appropriated
purposely calculated to interfere with the
construction of the big debris dam that
Is to be built with the $800,000 appropriated
for that purpose several years ago. The
officials of the society, state that unless
this law is repealed it "will cause a great
deal of trouble whep the construction of
these restraining dams begins.

Graham adjourned court at 5 o'clock and
fixed the continuation of the case for ;

Attorney Barrett put Mrs. Regan under j
a severe cross-examination and got her to
admit that several statements made by
her to Chief Lees after her arrest were
not true. --She said that Kennedy did not j
get his revolver.- and rush at her, nor did t
she take the revolver away from him.
She did not remember if she said to Ken- I
nedy, "If you come after me I will let t
you have it." -She never had the revolver :
In her possession.-? Both she and Kennedy :
had hold of- it,* and she did not know how

TWO MEN ASPHYXIATED.
Both Found Dead in Hotels and Given
the Benefit of a Verdict of
Accident.
Two more unfortunates passed out of
this life through the gates' of gas last
Thursday night. The first was Lee Cau
\llll. He arrived at the Hackmeier Hotel,
No. 123 Eddy street, last Thursday after
noon, and registered as from Sonoma
County. Yesterday .... morning- at 9:45
the bedmaker smelled a strong odor of
gas coming from Caudlll's room, the tran
som of which was open. A forcible entry
was made, the room was found to be full
of gas and Caudill was dead in bed. The
stopcock .of the â fixture was turned
fully on. Before retiring Caudill gave the
clerk of the hotel $13 to keep for him until
morning, ' and said that he intended to
start for Coos Bay on a steamer yester
day afternoon.
There are two theories of the case. The
first is that Caudill blew out the gas;
the second that he retired leaving. the gas
burning, and that it was accidentally ex
tinguished' during the night or turned off
"at the meter and then turned on again.
The hotel -people deny that the gas Is
turned off during the night, and the only
theory left is that the deceased blew out
the gas.
The second victim was Thomas Hogan.
He was found dead yesterday morning in
his room at the New Western Hotel. He
had gone to bed drunk on the night be
â¢fore, and it is believed that he turned the
gas stopcock carelessly -and left it partly
open, after extinguishing the flame.
The Coroner's jury returned a verdict
of accidental death in both cases. * â :â â -â

Suspected Men.
Coroner Hill held an Inquest yesterday
into ' the cause of the death of Charles
Adolph Schmid, the ex-convict, who was
murdered >in his room In the lodging
house at 815 Stockton street last Friday
night. Detective Wren and Dr. Pryor of
the City and County Hospital swore that
Schmid made an ante-mortem statement
to the effect that Al Flanders, master of
the tug 'Millie,, and Charles Forrest, a
barber, had entered his room and assault
ed him, and that Forrest had used a
hatchet upon him. Detective Wren told
also of having followed blood spots from
the lodging house to Pine street, half a
block from the residence of Forrest. For
rest swore that he never left his room on
the night of the murder. . â¢ " '. â 
; Flanders swore that on Friday night he
was at home attending to his wife, who
was ill, and that he did not leave the
house at night at all. This testimony was
corroborated by his wife.
It was shown that Schmid had also stat
ed that his aggressor was a soldier sur
geon, whose sweetheart Schmid had cap
tured, and on another occasion he said
that a Chinaman had inflicted the wounds
upon him
The jury returned a verdict that the de
ceased was murdered by unknown per
sons. -â¢

- * T * __
Lawyer T. J. Crowley made a strong
plea for mercy yesterday in United States
District Judge de Haven's court when his
clients, Mrs. Grace Allison, alias Qulnn,
alias Collins, alias Smith, and I. W. Bain,
alias H. C. Curtis, the brace of matrimo
nial bureau sharpers, appeared before the
court for sentence on the charge of using
the United States mails for the purpose of
defrauding old bachelors in quest of
wives. Mr. Crowley moved for an arrest
of judgment, then for a new trial, both
of which motions Were denied. Then. in.
mitigation ' of punishment, he placed N.
C. Collins, the putative husband of the
successfully seductive woman, on the
stand and proved by Mr. Collins that he
Intended to take his bride to Midway,
Ky., to reside and that they were* mar
ried last December in Jeffersonville, Ind.
He said that his "wife" was in bad
health; that she believed herself to be In
a delicate condition and that the air of
a prison would not agree with her.
Then the lady told the court how she
had been suffering from nervous prostra
tion; how her eyes troubled her at times
so. that she had to wear goggles and re
main ln a dark room for three days at a
time, but the Judge evidently considering
that there were plenty of dark rooms at
the lady's disposal in San Quentin peni
tentiary brushed these pleas aside and
proceeded to pass sentence.
He began by saying that the duty of
pronouncing judgment upon a criminal
was most. delicate. The court must take
into consideration what is just to the pub
lic and the degree of punishment to be
Inflicted. The case had been carefully
triedâ in . fact, he could not recall a case
in which he had sat as a Judge that had
been more completely presented than the
present one. The counsel for the defend
ants had made the most of it, and the
court was fully persuaded that were It
not for the fact that the evidence of the
guilt of the defendants was simply over
whelming a different verdict would haVe
been rendered. *
He regarded the offense for which the
defendants were tried as very grave.
There are many crimes where the defend
ant may urge in extenuation' that the
crime was committed in the heat of pas
sion or under the stress of some great
temptation, but the offense of which the
defendants had been convicted was not of
that kind. It must have been deliberately
planned, and in order to be successful
they must be able to meet with men. of
more than ordinary credulity.
The court then sentenced both defend
ants to- be imprisoned for fifteen months
in the penitentiary at' San Quentin, and
each to pay a fine of $500. . . â *:**
Mrs. Allison received the sentence with
a sneering smile, and turning to Collins,
who was sitting by her side, muttered,
"The old ." . The reporters and others
who heard the remark were more than
ever convinced that she was a real
"loldy."
The defendants had put up $3000 cash
bail and this sum will be levied upon for
the payment of the $1000 fine. Bert Schles
inger, on behalf of Dr. Allison of Temple,
Tex., has also attached the ball money
in the suit of Dr. Allison against his
namesake to recover the value of the dia
monds and other presents given to her by
him as engagement tokens. . :i'.x+

vict. Judge Cook was asked to admit
them to bail, on the ground that both
were in poor health; but the court refused
to consider the proposition and ordered
that they remain in custody until their
cases have been finally disposed of

POWER FOR GOOD OF
FRATERNAL ASSOCIATION
BEY. FRANCIS B. DOHERTY AT
METROPOLITAN TEMPLE.
Immense Gathering Listens to the
Eloquent Priest's Address Given
Under the Auspices of
the Y. M. I.
Before an audience that filled Metro
politan Temple until standing room was
at a premium. Rev. Francis B. Doherty,
C.S.P., lectured on "Fraternity," under
the auspices of San Francisco Council,
No. 7, Y. M. 1., last evening. Judge Mu
rasky acted as president of the evening,
and before the lecture the following pro
gramme was rendered, to the keen enjoy
ment of those present:
Sousa's marches, Hynes' Orchestra; in
troduction. George W. Murphy, president
San Francisco Council No. 7, T. M. I.;
address, Hon. Frank J. Murasky, chair
man of the evening; vocal solo, Mrs. W.
Winters, accompanist Miss L. Dewyre;
organ selections, Mrs. Marie Kelly; plan
tation specialties, Denis C. Sheerin; con
tralto solo, selected. Miss Xena Roberts.
When Father Doherty was Introduced
he was tendered an ovation that lasted
for several minutes. After quiet was re
stored and he began his address he. was
accorded the closest attention until he
closed. Father Doherty Is an eloquent
speaker, and his lecture, Illustrating the
good influence upon the world of organ
ization, particularly fraternal organiza
tion, was handled ln a masterly manner,
flashes of wit now and then brightening
his thoughtful discourse. He said, in part:
Myself a priest of a fraternal order. I am
here to speak to you upon the subject of fra
ternity. Association is a law of nature; asso
ciation is a errand equalizer,. for It brings forth
all the best elements that are In us. We need
association that gives, us strength. It Is a
necessity. It Is not good for man to be alone;
every woman will tell you so. The soldier

fights the better when his comrade ls by his
side.
But association is not perfect until another
element enters into It, the element of organi
zation. We live, as It were, In an age of or
ganization. Look at the organized trusts and
other gigantic concerns. There seems to be an
era of organization among us and I have had
some experience in that line myself. Far away
at the mission to which I was once attached
every man and woman in the town seemed to
belong to some fraternal order or another, and
of course they had no time to attend to the
mission.
Did I decry these orders? No! I did some
organizing myself. I called to mind that most
ancient of orders, the order of Home Society,
and I proceeded to establish it there. The first
indication of a proper fraternal spirit is in
the Home Society, for fraternity, like charity,
begins at home. - â¢ ,
The Catholic church has been the greatest
fraternal srclety of the world through the
ages, and it Is in the Catholic church that fra
ternity is at its best. What you need to-day
is vigorous Catholic organization; organization
of liberal Catholics, not bigots, for that day is
done, and when we are thus perfectly organized
the world will be ours.

CLAIM WILLEY WAS
NON COMPOS MENTIS
RELATIVES SEEK TO SET ASIDE
HIS LAST WILL.
Louisa M. Muirhead, Sole Devisee,
Must Make Battle for His Es
tate in the Courts.
If Louisa M. Muirhead enjoys the
wealth left by the late Charles Walter
Willey when he shuffled off this mortal
coil on January 29, IS9B, she must battle
for It in the Probate Court. Yesterday a
contest to the will of the deceased, which
named Mrs. Muirhead as sole devisee, was
filed by W. K. Springer and R. Springer,
uncles, and Abbie W. Bridham and Sarah
C. Sharrer, aunts of the decedent. The
contestants are the only surviving heirs
of the testator, and will seek to have his
will set aside on various grounds.
As a first ground of contest it is averred
that the testator was of unsound mind
and mentally Incompetent to make or
sign a will. It is further charged that the
document was not signed by the deceased,
and if signed at all by him the signature
was procured by means of undue influence
exerted over him by Mrs. Muirhead and
others whose names are unknown. Willey
is said to have been mentally incompe
tent by reason of the excessive use of In
toxicating liquors, and his desire for these
beverages was satisfied by the husband of
the respondent, who ran a saloon on the
ground floor of the building in which they
lived.
By her acts of alleged friendship Mrs.
Muirhead led Willey to believe that she
was his only friend and influenced him to
bequeath her his property. In consequence
the contestants ask the court to declare
the alleged will to be fraudulent and to
order the estate distributed according to
the laws of inheritance.

Conferences Held in

RETURN OF CAPTAIN PAYSON
VALLEY ROAD INTERESTS WER-S
DISCUSSED.
John Player to .'..range for Complet
ing the Equipment of the Val
ley Road and for Car
Shops.
Captain A. H. Payson, second vice-pres
ident of the Valley road, returned from a
month's sojourn In the East on Thurs
day. During his stay there he had a num
ber of conferences with the officials of
the Santa Fe Company which recently
acquired the ownership of the Southern
Pacific's rival line in tuis State. Captain
Payson is the local representative of the
Santa Fe on the board of the Valley road,
and matters relating to the future opera
tion and improvement of the newly ac
quired California mileage of the Santa Fe
were discussed. ;â : /
It is not expected that the Valley road
will be formally turned over to its new
owners until October, as it will not be
completed before that time. With pos
session of this local line, the Santa Fe will
have a , through direct independent line
between Chicago and San Francisco, and
for the first time since It began operation
the Southern Pacific Company will have
genuine competition for the transconti
nental business from and into San Fran
cisco. â  .- ..
Captain Payson stated that no plans
had yet been decided upon for the Im
provement of the water front property
purchased by the Santa Fe Company
about a month ago. He stated that this
would probably be done this spring when
the executive officers of the company
would pay a visit to the city.
John Player, superintendent of the San
ta Fe, accompanied Captain Payson to
California, but will not arrive in this city
until to-day. He delayed his visit to the
metropolis until he had made a tour of
inspection of the line of the Valley road,
with a view to arranging for the proper
equipment of the line as an overland road.
It is to be provided with every modern
improvement that will give comfort to
and attract passengers and that will ex
pedite the handling of freight. Among
other things, Mr. Player will look over
the situation with a view to the location
of railroad shops in connection with the
local branch of the Santa Fe system. Mr.
Player's stay will not extend over more
than a few days.

Tributes to St. Valentine's day are a

*. ' The racing at Ingleside yesterday was
diversified by seeing tho fields disappear
: In a fog bank, and then an anxious wait
for general results. In a measure it is
.'.an improvement over clear weather sport.
â¢.Money is burned up, and the luckless
'- .'speculator has no grievances to pour into
..the' ear of his neighbor. Very little could
. be seen of the running, and there was a
-noticeable lack of "kicking." Four favor

â¢-. "fogged," and the ring got hack a con
siderable portion of the money it loaned

-could scarcely be manufactured short
.'.enough for him. P. Ryan purchased the

.never headed, beating the odds-on choice,
â¢.Arbaces, half a length ln 1:42*4- Eddie

'.-"with 101 pounds up. was made the medium
â  :.pf..a big plunge, going to the post a 6 to 5

â â  view Miss Rowena was leading, and the

something In reserve. Mary Black fin

'-'In the second event, at six furlongs, the
â gray horse, Paul Griggs, with "Skeets"

The Montana bred horse. Tammany

showed a rare streak of speed in the live

plunge caused his odds to speedily la I

a 30 to 1 shot, downed Merry Boy a short

Track Notes.
After Racivan had taken the opening J
' ! event, Barney Schrelber, in talking about !
I the horse, said "there must be something
j wrong in my stable." The St. Louis pen- '
cller's castoffs certainly do show marked i
improvement as a rule, and all agreed
j with him.
Trainer Billy Randall is certainly en- ;
I titled to much credit for the manner in j
which he sends his horses to the post. j
Tammany Hall II was fit to run for a j
: kingdom, and in his hands Miss Rowena j
has been a veritable wonder. So, too, with j
Ostler Joe, which will always be remem
bered as one of the most consistent horses j
ever raced in this State.
Frank Van Ness stood to make an old !
fashioned clean-up with Midas. The old j
horse was backed from 100 down to 30 to â 
1, and after the race Frank said if he
had finished flrst instead of second he ,
I would have cashed JSOOO worth of paste- j
i boards.
Merry Boy was one of the warm ones !
lof the afternoon's sport. Maxey Blumen- i
I thai chalked up 50 to 1 against the Merri- |
wa gelding, and was almost knocked off I
the block hy those in on the know, anx- j
ious to get aboard. The good thing ran a j
close third. , _ ,_,_,__,'
i The California Oaks will be decided this j
i afternoon. A moderate field faces the j
] barrier. 'V - , i
! There is at least one rider on our tracks |
; of whom it is a pleasure to speak words j
:of praise. That one is Joe Piggott. When-
I ever he has a mount and the odds against
! the horse recede in the betting the ques
tion is never propounded, "Is Piggott try
! ing?" If the bettor fancies the horse he
i can put his money down, and rest assured
that he will get a ride. When weight
compels him to leave the saddle he will
always find a warm spot in the heart or. j
every California race goer.
The stewards of Pacific Coast Jockey
Club met last evening at the Palace |
Hotel and reheard the cases of several
suspended and ruled off horsemen. The
thirty-day suspension of Jockey Mc- j
I Nichols was so modified as to allow the *
I boy to ride for his employer, Nick Hall.
Joe Stern, the owner of Prince Tyrant,
I was denied the privileges of the track in !
! future. From evidence shown it appears i
that Stern picked up a pool ticket in the j
I ring giving it to a pool boy to cash, thus ;
i defrauding the rightful owner of his
i earnings. The suspended steeplechase :
i riders, McMahon. Peters, Higgins and
: Stanford, were denied further hearing, j
I The case of Willie Shields, trainer of the j
jumper, Lord Chesterfield, but recently
ruled off, was taken under advisement.

VICTOR DEMARTIM IS AFRAID OF
GLADYS' HANDY LITTLE SHOTGUN
Sensational Interrup-
tion of Wedding
Festivities.
GLADYS MATHENEY, who per
sists in calling herself Gladys De
martini, is out again with her
handy little shotgun, and conse
quently Victor Demartlni, official Italian
Interpreter of the criminal courts of this
city, has been obliged to apply to the po
lice for protection. T 'â¦ .
For the past three years Gladys has ap
peared with success in the character of
Demartinl's nemesis. Five revolvers that
added much to the dramatic effect of the
lady's role are now in the possession of
the interpreter, and the manner in which
they came into his keeping will figure
among the thrilling hairbreadth escapes
in the Demartlnl biography.
About a year ago Demartlnl had the
winsome Gladys arersted and charged
with assault to murder. That charge,
which still hangs over the Matheney
head In Judge Low's court, was the
means of securing for the Italian gentle
mnn a brief respite from shotgun atten
tion.
On Thursday last Demartlnl was mar
ried to Mrs. Mary Bernlerl, heiress of the
late Lulgi Brizzolara, and one of the not
ed belles of the Italian colony. The occa
sion of Demartlnl's wedding was the cue
for Gladys to reappear on the scene of
action, and the result was a badly fright
ened bride, an irate bridegroom and sub
sequently an appeal to the strong arm
of the law for, protection. *- >â¢â¢*.
.Demartlnl, who admits illicit relations
with woman in the past, made the
following' explanation of ' the ' unfortunate
persecution he has suffered at her hands.
"For the past three years, in fact, ever
since I have tried to sever my connections
with the woman, she has followed me and
threatened me. During that time she at
regular intervals was lavishing her at
tentions upon Swotzel, the Mayor of Eu
reka City, and it was her boast that she
had relieved the . gentleman â¢ of $40,000.
About, a year ago, ;, while *â  I* was '> dining

suddenly behind me and pointed; a re
NOW FOR STEELHEADS.
Anglers Who Are Enjoying Good
Sport on Russian River With
Rod and Line.
During the past week very favorable
reports have been received from anglers
who are now trolling for game steelheads
on Russian River. Al Wilson, the veteran
angler, and some of his friends have been
camped at Duncans Mills for the past two
weeks, but the conditions were not favor
able for the enjoyment of good sport until
very recently, when a run of fishes aver
aging five pounds in weight put in an
appearance near the mouth of Austin
Creek. â¢
Wilson has taken quite a few nice flsh
during the week, which he shipped to
Fish Commissioner Hon. Alexander Vo
gelsang, who kindly 'remembered the
sporting editors of the press when he dis
posed of the many highly prized denizens
of the stream to friends "in need of brain
food." Vogelsang is a man of extraordi
nary â¢ forethought. He never forgets
friends, and 'especially whenever there
happens to be a distribution of fishes con
templated. Vogelsang, under the advice
of his medical adviser, does not indulge ,
in fish dinners because of a dread of that
horrible complaint, viz., enlargement of
the brain.
Among, the well-known local anglers
who will possibly catch more water than
fish on Russian River to-morrow are
"Honest" John Butler, who has been at
the game for the past three days, without
success, and who is still trying; "Chap
lain" Terry, who recently lost the grip on
a fashionable visitor; Colonel Kelihor, the
famous tarpon fisherman of the south;
John Gallagher, the veteran roeman of
Oakland; W. R. McFarland, an Inventor
of all kinds of things destructive to game
fishes in the way of tackle; A. Shattuck.
who is the founder of the brass spoon;
Charles Breldenstein, the adipose tissue
man, whose nerves are unstrung at cer
tain times; Dave Sachs, a man who can
kill striped bass without the aid of a rod;
"Doc" Cox, whose famous strike sends a
messenger of death into the jaws of the
gamest of game fishes; Jack Samml, "the
flowery" man, who lands heavy-weight
fishes with the assistance of a well-trained
Irish water spaniel, and last, though by
no means least, "Doc" Watt, whose repu
tation for clearing trout streams of ob
jectionable shrubbery by means of strong
tackle and a desire to conquer has spread
as far as the Highlands of old Scotland.
. Should the weather rem- in fine the
prospects for good fishing on Russian
River are good; but the fact that the
steelheads are making another move to
reach their spawning grounds is, in the
opinion of veteran anglers, an evidence
that a storm is near at hand, and anglers
must necessarily be up and doing lf they
expect to i enjoy any sport on Russian
River this year.
It was reported yesterday that four
large steelheads were caught during the
past week at the "White House" and
"Sandspit," Point Reyes.
OARSMEN FORM PLANS.
Boat Clubs Are Repairing Damages
or Devising Improvements.
The South End Rowing Club's barge
Felton is still at Rogers' yard, Alameda.
The new seats, oarlocks and other repairs
will almost make a new boat of It.
Last Sunday afternoon there was a
good attendance of members at the Dol
phin boathouse. Both the racing barges
were taken out, the new one being
manned by C. Roach (bow), J. S. Earls
(No. 2), Dr. Axton (No. 3), William O.
Patch (stroke) and Dr. Hill (cockswain).
The old one carried J. Farrell (bow), E.
Sullivan (No. 2), A. Mlchelettl (No. 3),
George Sullivan (stroke) and W. Schu
macher (cockswain). -The crews spurted
from the boathouse to Moiggs wharf and
back again, the new boat built by Twlgg
proving her superiority to. the old barge.
The Dolphin boathouse is so much used
by its members as a resort in their leisure
hours that It is proposed to fit it up with
Incandescent lights, a steam heater and
a telephone. â¢
The Alameda Boat Club gave a very
successful vaudeville entertainment last
night in Armory Hall, Alameda, for the
volver at my head. I seized the weapon
from her and subsequently had her ar
rested for assault with a deadly weapon,
of which offense she was adjudged guilty
and sentenced to three months' Imprison
ment. Since then she has made several
other attempts on my life, and a charge
of assault to murder is now hanging over
head in Judge Low's court. -.
"For a little while Gladys ceased her ob
noxious attentions and I concluded she
had returned to Swotzel. whose friend she
has been, on and off, for the past two

ried to Mrs. Mary Bernlerl, and on Sun
day we celebrated the happy event by a
banquet at the home of my mother on
Green street. Sunday night, after, the
festivities, as my. wife and myself, accom
panied by Mr. and Mrs. P. Bebano and
Mr. and Mrs. Howard, were returning to
our home at 1008*. Clay- street we noticed
that a man and woman were seated at.the
head of the stairs, v When we reached the
top of the three steep flights that lead to
the house thÂ© woman rose and hissed in
purpose of raising funds with which to
enlarge its boathouse, which has for some
time past been too small for the'increased
number of members. The committee hav
ing the entertainment in charge consisted
of F. S. Cone. David Greenleaf, W. G.
Hansen, Theodore Eisfeldt and Herbert
i Wilhelmi. All worked hard to secure
good talent and insure a large attendance.
The entertainment realized a considerable
sum for the building fund. ***â¢' â -â¢;*>â¢
The regular monthly meeting of the Pio
neer Rowing Club was held last Sunday.
Over in Sessions Basin, East Oakland,
I just to the south of the quarters of the
Oakland Canoe Club, are the boathouses
of the Columbia Rowing Club and of the
Boating Association of the University of
California. On fine Saturdays and Sun
days considerable activity is to be seen
! around both these boathouses, several
| young men going out for exercise in row
boats or outrigged skiffs. But though
these two associations are the most gen
! uinely amateur rowing clubs on the bay,
j neither of them sends representatives
to the Pacific Association of the Amateur
I Athletic Union nor enters barge crews or
scullers for any of the regattas held on
the bay. The best interests of amateur
rowing in California would be served if
these two organizations could be induced
to join the Pacific Association and to send
j representatives to the open regattas.
It is highly probable that during the
present season the Olympic Boat. Club
I will be established upon a new basis.
i President Joseph O'Connor, who has been
; a member of the Olympic Club since 1869,
is enthusiastic about the project. He
wishes to establish at Tiburon a sort of
country clubâ headquarters for oars
men, cyclists, pedestrians, handball play
ers and for all desiring a course of athletic
exercise and training. A committee on
ways and means has been appointed, and
it is expected that a plan will be formu
latetd.
The Olympic Club has promised to pay
over the initiation fee of $10 to the boat
club If thirty new members are secured.
This would provide a sum of $300, with
which a new barge could be purchased.
The boat club during last season was pre
vented from entering crews at the open
regattas largely by the fact of having no
suitable light barge. .
THE TENNIS WORLD.
Ladies' Handicap Doubles Tourna
ment and Some Hot Matches
During the Week.
The ladies' tournament, doubles handi
cap, which was to have been played on
the California Club courts Wednesday
last, was begun but,. owing to the failure
of several teams to put in an appearance,
It was postponed a week. The first match
between Miss Elsie Clark and Miss Bow
man and Miss Opal Pierce and Miss Ada
Clarke was won by the former team In
two straight sets, the score being 6-3. 6-2.
Miss Clark and Miss Bowman gave their
opponents 30 in every game and found
no difficulty in defeating them with that
heavy handicap. The other, teams entered
for the tournament which will be played
on Wednesday are: Miss Hunter and Miss
Flsen, Miss Edith Chesebrough and Miss
Ruth Foster, Miss Helen Chesebrough
and Miss Eckart, Miss Bacon and Miss
Lacy, Miss Deane and Miss Painter, Miss
Sandman and Mips Lola Davis. This list
comprises the great majority of the young
lady players of the California Tennis Club
and with the handicaps allowed should
insure closely contested matches.
During the week some very interesting
matches were played. â¢ The Whitney
brothers have been battling one another
in hot singles, George winning the major
ity of sets. Murdock, the Alameda play
er, visited the courts, and, joined with
George Whitney, played a very hot match
against Robert N. Whitney and George
Bradshaw. The first set was a lengjthy
affair, the score 14-12 showing how even
ly matched the teams were. This set and
the second also went to George Whitney
and the Alamedan.
In a three handed game George Brad
shaw bested Bllven and Root, 6-4, 7-5.
Bliven and Root then went at a singles
contest which lasted all afternoon, the
majority of games being attached to the
former's credit. Daly beat McGavln, the
elder, 6-2, 6-4. Grant Smith and Cornell
have been playing some hot matches of
late, with the honors devolving to Smith.
If the attendance warrants it on Sunday
an impromptu tournament will be played.

"On Monday she called at 5 Mason

money, or kill me. â  On Wednesday she
went round to the saloon at the southwest
corner of Larkin street and Golden Gate

with the proprietor. It has come to such
a pass .that my wife and mother l are

BOYAL COUBSING EVENT.
A Titled English Gentleman Is Ex
pected to Attend the Ingleside
Meeting of To-Day.
It can be safely said that lovers of
coursing who will attend the open stake
meetings at Ingleside Park to-day and to
morrow will not regret the fact of being
present to witness the sport. ._- 'W
A better card than that which will be
scanned to-day by Ingleside Park leash
men could scarcely be got up If It were
known that his Royal Highness the
Prince of Wales should happen to be
present at the meeting. But If the Prince
cannot possibly attend, owing to the dis
tance between points and other and more
Important engagements which will detain
him, in old England, it is understood, nev
ertheless, that English royalty will grace
the Ingleside Park grounds this after
noon. * . â *
Report says that Lord Beresford, who
is at present enjoying our glorious cli
mate, will doubtless witness the races at
Ingleside this afternoon. Lord Beresford
is a fond lover of coursing and takes
much pleasure in witnessing the game
whenever the opportunity presents.
Count yon Halpin has been delegated a
committee of one to receive his Lordship
should he put in an appearance at the
royal gates of the park this afternoon.
W. E. Thompson will introduce another
one of his string of breadwinners to-day.
His new charge .is named Lowlander
Prince, by Charley-Princess Fullerton.
Thompson will be a very surprised man
if Lowlander will not do equally as good
running as St. Orion.
James Byrnes has two very handsome
youngsters entered in the stake. They
are by Sly Girl-Westslde. If blood will
tell the Byrnes string should run well up
into the -take.
T. Cooney expects to Bee his performer,
Blackhawk, bowl over some of the old
dogs to-day. Blackhawk has Just passed
out of the puppy class and will doubtless
win his first all-age course.
T. A. Gaffney is positive that his dog
Sir John Arnot will surprise some of the
natives this afternoon. Sir John has had
a well-earned rest, and is now feeling as
fine as a fiddle.
Bartel Bros, feel assured that their
representatives, Mac's Melody, Rest
Assured and Ben Hur, will land them a
bunch of golden coin at the wind-up of
the present meeting.
Joe Thrift is as happy as the days are
long. He contends that one of the three
performers representing his kennel will
assuredly capture the long end of the
long green. His flyers are Brutus, For
get and St. Michael.
â¢Mr. Lynch is in hopes of returning on
Sunday evening with pockets lined with
gold and silver. . He has Lottie M, Mys
tic Maid and Loyalty in the stake.
A. Vanderberg expects that if American
Eagle cannot whip every dog he meets he
will at least scare the speed out of some
of -his opponents when he scoops down
on his prey.
J. Keenan's Royal Buck and Flying
Buck are said to be ln good form, and if
the report circulated be true they will cer
tainly throw grass in the faces of the
dogs who will oppose them to-day. They
are both royal veterans of the sward.
The imported dog Interestum will be
watched closely this afternoon. It is
said that he is rapidly rounding into form
and will cut a dash if conditions are at
all favorable.
Tommy Hall, the prince of the Merced
coursing fraternity, will put in an appear
ance at Ingleside to-day. Tommy dropped
into town yesterday to see hiÃ many
friends and incidentally to learn how the
"grip" was affecting them.
The following communication to The
Call from the executive committee of the
Ingleside Coursing Club speaks for itself:
- SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 7, 1893.
Sporting Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: In
last Sunday's Issue of the Chronicle there ap
peared an article In which It is stated that It
was possible that the California leashmen
would all combine and throw over the Ameri
can Coursing Board and conduct their business
on the coast altogether by combining with the
Ingleside people.
Now - tor the Information of these people I
can state with certainty that the Ingleside
Coursing Club will continue to run under the
rules of the American, Coursing Board In the
future as it has In the past, and if the Union
Coursing Park people have any grievances
against one or two members of the board that
shall not constitute any reason why the Ingle
side people shall take their fight on their
hands.
It seems very peculiar now that the Union
Park people should at this late d.'te try to
overthrow the American Coursing Board,
which is composed of gentlemen who have de
voted years of experience in handling this grand
old sport and who have certainly formed _ code
of rules that no fair-minded man can find fault
with. Another thing I wish to say is that
the Union Coursing Park people have always
been stanch adherents of the American Cours
ing Board. Now what has caused such a
change of sentiment? *Is it because of the rule
that they have adopted to prevent the owners
of greyhounds from entering their charges un
der kennel names? Then, If this is the cause,
let them form their own rules and run under
them. *.
There is no owner of greyhounds who does not
know full well what this kennel business means,
and if continued how detrimental It certainly
must be to the smaller owners of, say, one,
two or thrte dogs. The advancement of cours
ing under the rules of the American Coursing
Board on this coast has been far above the
expectations of even the most enthusiastic.
Respectfully, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE,
Ingleside Coursing Club.
COLLEGE BASEBALL.
University of California "Will r Flay
To-Day for the First Time
This Year.
Track athletics are for the present
shelved at the universities until the base
ball season gets well -under way. Last
Saturday the Stanford nine played the
Fireman's Fund team, and were defeated
by a score of 4 to 0. The Firemen are
the strongest aggregation the college men
have had to meet in several years. In
order to secure good practice, this nine
was organized with the best material
available. It is not a professional base
ball team, but a number of the men en
listed in its ranks have played profes
sional ball.
This afternoon the Fireman's Fund will
line up against the University of Califor
nia team. It will be the first game played
by the blue and gold this year, and should
form a basis of judgment in a comparison
between the two college teams. . Stanford
has the making of a first-class team, and
is in better shape at present than their
adversaries across tne bay. The game
this afternoon will be played on the Uni
versity campus. The teams will line up

Bold Fighting
Talk.
Two Filipinos arrived in this city ye*
terday afternoon on the America Maru,
They came here with the original inten
tion of joining their three companions
who preceded them to Wahlngton as em
issaries to this government, but since they
have learned what happened to their ill.
advised countrymen they are undecided
what to do. They are General. E. Rlego
de Dlob, whose title is General of Division
of the Philippine army, and Senor M*
Riviera. They were unaware of the troul
ble until they were informed of it by tha
men on the pilot boat outside of the heads
and were dumfounded at the informal
tion. XX2 '&-77XH -..,,.**-â¢', Â-;..-;. y
Riviera, who is a young man of 26 and
took the second degree in high school in
his native land, speaks English quite flu
ently, though with a marked Spanish acÂ«
cent. As soon as he realized the full for
of the news, he said: .-â¢'â >
"Well, I am very sorry the conflict has
been precipitated. I was in hopes that
nothing of the kind would occur until wa
had Unshed our mission to the United
States Government. But what has been
done ls done, and I suppose it will serious
ly interfere with any negotiations we may
have had in mind. General Dlos and 1
were with the other three commissioners,
but we remained at Yokohama on account
of sickness, and were to have joined our
friends in Washington." "ix â â '
When told that the others had taken
refuge ln Montreal they again expressed
astonishment and were anxious to know
whether there was any danger in their re
maining on American territory. On being
assured that they were as safe as thougn
they were in their own land, they ex
pressed gratification.
When they reached this city they wenl
to the Palace Hotel and Immediately sel
out to inquire if any telegrams had been
received for them from trie other com*
missioners. They went to both telegraph
offices, but there were no dispatches, and
they seemed to be much disappointed, al
though they attributed it to the fact that
the steamer had arrived one day ahead oi
schedule time, and by to-day they expect
instructions from their companions whicb
will shape their future movements.
The news of the terrible loss sustained
by their people must have come with
stunning effect on the two Filipinos, for
they appear to be entirely nonplused, as il
not quite assured of their security. Ac
cording to Dr. Farrell, who also returned
on the steamer and conversed with Ri
viera on the voyage over, they have
changed considerably in their demeanor.
Riviera was emphatic in his declarations
at that time that the commission, of
which he was a member, was going to de
mand Independence from the Government
at Washington.
"We will fight to the death," said Ri
viera, "for I tell you we Filipinos know
how to fight. We want to be free just a.
you are in your country." â¢
During the' Interview Riviera translat
ed the conversation to General Rios, but
the latter was particularly reticent and
made very few comments. . '>*

PAN* JOSE, Feb. 10.â residence of
11. Ward Wright, ex-president of the
â¢ Union Savings Bank, was attached to
â¢day by Sheriff Lang-ford on a writ ob
tained in the Superior Court of Tulare
County by John Frueler, who seeks to
.. recover $4000 with interest at 7 per cent
* since December 24, 1898, on a promis-
s ory note. Wright is defendant in con
.* Junction with Anton-*- Friant and T. E.
.Johnston, who also are directors of the
.Union Savings Bank.
This only tends to Increase the en
tanglement surrounding the bank's af
. fairs, and depositors are beginning to
.' realize they must act promptly. It was
.'..announced that Attorney General Fltz- |
;*. g/?rald would be here to-day and take I
.-..-.s-teps to force the bank into liauida
j'.tlon, but he did not come. In this
â¢â â¢'.event the present board of directors
'-.;..- would manage the bank affairs. As
ii these same men caused its ruin, the
/ depositors are determined to prevent
â¢â¢'.them doing so if possible.
.:.. It has just leaked out that the Union
.-': Savings Bank officials were accustomed
7 to. making real estate agents pay a
â¢ ..commission on loans. In one case a
. â¢ prominent citizen wanted a loan of
V..i_500 in order to purchase a piece of
;â¢ property. The bank officials went to a
;â¢* real ' estate dealer through whom the
-.â¢â¢' purchase was being made and told him
*.-; his- customer could get the loan pro
vided he (the real estate man) gave
'the bank a commission of $100 on- the
â  .sale. These transactions were freauent
â  :' and the sums went into the officials'
â¢ .â¢â private pockets.
2, .The depositors of the Union Savings
' Bank held another meeting this morn-
Vlng at Turn Verein Hall. There were
..nearly 500 depositors present, repre-
. senting about 5250,000 that went over
;'the .bank's counters. The meeting was
. * a stormy one, and for a time it looked
â¢ as. though it would break up without
'.-accomplishing anything. A committee
.-was finally empowered to employ an
â¢ attorney at an expense not to exceed
. : lper cent of the amount recovered.
.; Persons representing $150,000 in de
posits signed this agreement.
'â¢' The creditors of E. B. Howard & Co.
â  : met in Druids' Hall to-day and decided
. 'â  to force Howard into insolvency to pro- >
tect their claims. About sixty credi- j
. tors were present, representing claims j
' aggregating $45,000. Howard will be
â given until Monday to go into volun
:tary insolvency, and in case he does
: not he will then be forced to.
One of the latest charges against the
â officers of the wrecked bank is one
.-which seems likely to cause them seri
ous* trouble. It is stated on unques
: tionable authority that when the bids
for the purchase of war bonds to be
issued by the United States Govern
ment were asked for by the Secretary
of the Treasury there were many peo-
p le in this city and county who de
sired to invest in the .securities, and in
.. order to do so entrusted their money to
.'the Union Savings Bank to be so in
vested. The bank was made, in effect,
.their agent. But it appears that the
. trust reposed in the concern was vio
. lated. In the majority of Instances the
â¢would-be investors are still whistling
â¢.for their bonds and where the money is
-ho one knows but those who misdi
rected the destinies of the bank.
The manner in which the bank offl
: cials managed to hold on to the money
' placed in their hands for investment is
-. .but a repetition of the peculiar methods
that have been in vogue in that insti
tution almost from the day of Its incor
. poratlon. They were always ready with
an explanation when asked why the
'â  bonds did not materialize, to the effect
: that there had been delay in the print
.*ing and signing of the valuable slips
.of per in Washington. This pre
pense was kept up until the last mo
â¢.-'rnent, and although a few of the would
. *><.â¢ purchasers managed by their per
sistence to obtain an accounting before
..the collapse the majority are out of
â¢pocket with apparently no prospect of
'.recovering bonds or money. One con
' .fldlng individual is said to have en
trusted $2200 to the bank for the pur
chase of bonds and received in return
. nothing but unfulfilled promises. Others
.'were, caught for sums varying from
'. $50 up, but the exact amount which was
. emptied Into the coffers of the bank in
'this' manner cannot be ascertained at
. :thls .time, although it is said to be
large. ___________________________

REVISION BILL
GOES THROUGH
French Deputies Pass
the Measure
OVER THE COMMITTEE REPORT \
FAILURE OF BATTLE TO UP- j
HOLD COURT OF CASSATION.
Premier Dupuy Declares the Govern
ment Is Prepared to Take the
Whole Responsibility for
the Bill.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Feb. 10.â -There was much ex
citement in the Chamber of Deputies
to-day, in anticipation of the consider
ation of the Government's revision bill
for which the Premier, M. Dupuy, had
i asked urgency.
Immediately after the opening of the
session M. Renaud-Morliere, the re
porter of the committee having the re
vision bill in charge, said the committee
had rejected the measure, "because
when one arrived at the creation of
courts of expediency there was no
further security for any one." Such
; proposals, the reporter added, always
aroused indignation, and he asked what
i could be the motive of the bill, since
I the accusations brought by M. Quesnay
de Beaurepaire, former president of the
civil section of the Court of Cassation,
against the criminal section of that
body had been acknowledged to be er
roneous.
M. Renaud-Morliere concluded by as
serting that the adoption of the bill
would be a useless one and a dangerous
sign of weakness, also remarking that
"to honor the army it is not necessary
to dishonor the maglstrature."
M. Mlllerand, Radical Socialist, made
a lively speech, opposing the measure
on the grounds set forth in the open
letter to the Government, signed by a
score of Deputies and a number of for
mer Cabinet Ministers, who declared
their intention to uphold the supreme
principles of Justice as above all at
tack.
M. Millerand aroused an Immense up
roar by saying that the Republicans
only had to note who were backing the
bill and the present agitation to know
where their duty lay.
The Premier said that the Govern
ment was prepared to take the whole
responsibility for the measure. The
Republicans, the Prime Minister added,
could, therefore, vote for the measure
with perfect security. The Government,
he pointed out. was neither the accom
plice nor the dupe of the adversaries of
a revision of the Dreyfus trial, but
doubts had arisen, causing fears as to
whether the sentence of a section of a
Court of Cassation was authoritative
enough to satisfy and calm the nation.
The bill, he insisted, was neither an
emergency measure, revolutionary nor
dictatorial. It was an affair which was
provoking throughout the world pole
mics which were lacerating French
hearts.
The trial revision bill was then
adopted by a vote of 332 to 232.
COLD WEATHER DOES
DAMAGE (N MINES
Pipes Burst and the Water in Ditches
and Small Creeks Frozen
Solid.
. REDDING, Feb. 10.â Unusually cold
weather prevailing In Trinity County has
resulted in the general suspension of
hydraulic and placer mining, besides the
Infliction of damage that will require
months to repair. A hard freeze came on
shortly after the heavy fall of snow,
bursting hydraulic mining pipes in all di
rections and solidifying the water ditches
and small creeks. La Grange Company
was forced to suspend operations, sus
taining damage to Its extensive pipe lines,
that will delay resumption of work until
late in the spring. Any attempt to repair
the burst pipes would be futile until
warmer weather sets in. The Brown Bear
mine at Deadwood also suspended opera
tions in portions of the mine on account
of burst pipes. On Stuarts Fork and, in
fact, all over the county where gravel
mining is carried on, the freeze has shut
down properties that were in full opera
tion. ..
In Shasta County no damage to pipe
lines is reported, though the scanty water
supply has been entirely cut off and
placer mining is suspended. The cold
weather, however, has proved a boon- to
the fruit growers, as almond and other
trees are about ready to blossom. Had
the cold weather held off a week or so
longer much fruit would have blossomed
out prematurely and been destroyed.
Small Damage to Almonds.
WOODLAND, Feb. 10.-Public Admin
istrator Dearing, who resides in Capay
Valley, was in this city to-day. He puts
at rest the disquieting rumors concerning
the damage to the almond crop in West
ern Yolo. During the warm wave which
prevailed several days ago a few trees
blossomed out. These early blossdms
were all killed. In a few other instances
buds began to swell and of course were
injured. The loss is small, however, and
probably will not exceed 5 per cent.
Veteran Guilty of Assault.
NAPA, Feb. 10.â The case of James M.
Jackson, charged with assault with a
deadly weapon to commit murder upon
William E. Colgon, both being veterans
of the Soldiers' Home, went to the jury
to-day. The jury brought in a verdict of
"guilty .of assault with a deadly weapon "
Sentence will be pronounced on Monday

SCHOOL GIRLS' FATE
SHROUDED IN MYSTERY
THERE is deep sorrow and anx
iety In two homes on Perry
street. Two daughters have
left cheerful abodes in search of
pleasure and have disappeared en
tirely. Both are schoolgirls under
the age of 15, and neither had cause
for leaving.
Mattle Wyckhoff, who lives at 146
Perry street, was the first one re
ported to the police as missing. Upon
investigation it was discovered that
Louisa Garcia, of 242*4 Perry street,
had also disappeared, and as they
were companions It Is surmised they
are together.
Mattle has never been away from
home before, and as her absence
stretches into weeks her parents,
brothers and sisters fear for her
safety. Louise had strolled away
on a previous occasion, yet her
absence is deeply felt by her rela
tives.
Boatswain Gus Harris of the Aus
tralia Is held responsible for the dis
appearance of the Wyckhoff girl. He
ls an old friend of her family, and
has visited her home whenever his
ship arrived in port. Having taken
a particular fancy to Mattie, he
has usually entertained her by tak
ing her to the theater, but it was
always his custom to bring her
home. Last Monday evening he es
corted the girl to the Orpheum and
since then she has not been seen.
Her father, who is employed on the
tug Relief, and her brothers have
searched everywhere, but without
success.
Her mother Is broken-hearted, and
her father has quit work in his ef
forts to obtain a trace of her. Be
MORE FISCAL
ENTANGLEMENT
FOR TEACHERS
Salaries That Never
Will Be Paid.
INJUNCTIONS LYING IN WAIT
A PENNILESS TEACHER CRYING
IN THE CORRIDOR.
How a Bribe-Grasping Director of the
Late Board Found His Price
Under a Sofa
Pillow.
The Board of Education ls busy Issuing
salary warrants; the courts are enjoining
payments and then modifying their or
ders; the Auditor Is taking his pen in
hand to audit, but, checked by another
court order or by warning of attorney,
stops short, and the : 1200 impoverished
teachers are turned away unpaid.
"To-morrow we will get â¢ our salary,"
they say hopefully, and look ahead to the
next day. But to-morrow follows to-mor
row and there is a fresh obstacle every
sunrise. To-day is one of those hopeful
"to-morrows" and the court is confidently
expected to bring the January money to
those who have earned It. But there is
no hope that the dreadful, injunction will
hold off. Ere the Auditor can audit or
the Treasurer can pay, the merchant
creditors will tie everything up in a Gor
dian knot. ; .
Only by the intervention of a miracle
wifl the November-December salaries
ever be paid, and the teacher-creditors
wronged by that shameless coterie known
as the "solid nine" of the late board must
settle down to this unchangeable fact.
Those warrants have virtually passed into
the "sweet by and- by," where they may
be cashed on some "to-morrow." This ls
not all. The January salaries, in a prob
ability that borders on the inevitable, will
unpaid overlap February, and the two
months will pile themselves on to March
in a jumbled heap. How many more
months will be massed in the fiscal wreck
no man may say, but the injunction will
cover all.
â¢ Yesterday a sad-faced woman, a $50
teacher, bunkoed out of three months' pay
by Messrs: Ragan et al.. appeared at the
Auditor's oflice. She had heard that her
January salary would be paid, and the $40,
less the 20 per cent, would fall into her
hands like manna from the skies. When
she was told that no demands could yet
be signed, she went out into the dark,
cheerless corridor and cried. Out of that
golden $150, not one cent could she re
ceive. Just across; the hall over $600,000
is lying in secure boxes, and she Is desti
tute. Curious passers-by stopped and
stared at the sobbing woman. Presently
an employe in one of the City Hall de
partments, to whom the sad-faced, tearful
woman teachers haunting the corridors
have become an every-day spectacle,
whispered her story, and the crowd, out
of respect for her tears, sympathetic for
one in distress, moved away, and she
wept alone just without the office door of
the city treasury, where her all on earth
lies behind slabs of triple steel.
There is another teacher haunting the
corridors of the City Hall and her story,
while not possessing the pathos of tue
other, will serve as a sample of the late
board's villainy and cupidity. Early last
year her mother, a woman only in moder
ate circumstances, living in this city, be
gan seeking a position in the School De
partment for her daughter, a capable
teacher, having taught several years m
another county. She soon learned that
there was ordinarily no vacancy, but coin
could make one. Eventually coin uid
make one. The price, she was adroitly
given to understand, was $500. It was a
large sum for her, but the position was
for life. 'Kate Kennedy and other teach
ers had tested the question, and this
strengthened the fond mother to a sac
rifice. Other teachers were buying their
positions in the School Department, she
was told, and moreover, It was a good in
vestment, so she silenced her conscience,
raised the money, dollar j by dollar, by
every expedient known to a determined
and "insistent borrower. .. * ; *- :â 
She was told how : to hand over the
priceâ not in the ' ordinary * commercial
wayâ and take your. receipt, but by a
neater method. She was told to leave the
i cola in a Uttle canvas bag under a. cush- j
fore Harris' boat sailed on Wednes
day Mr. Wyckhoff called on him on
the Australia, and after listening to
his explanation searched every nook
and cranny in the vessel in the hope
of finding his missing child.
Before Harris left he told differ
ent stories to members of the fam
ily. To the father he said he left
Mattie at Eighth and Market streets
in company with her friend Louise,
after having given them some rides
on the steeplechase. Again he told
her brother that he had left her at
the Chutes.
Believing that Mattle would re
turn of her own accord her parents
waited a few days and then called
in the assistance of the Police De
partment. Detective Coleman, who
was detailed on the case, was given
a photograph and a complete de
scription of the missing girl. He
then visited the distracted mother
of Louise and learned that she had
left home on the same evening to go
to night school, but had not re
turned. The parent begged the de
tective to bring her child back to
her, dead or alive, but as yet he has
found no trace of her.
Both girls were tall and well de
veloped for their age. Mattle at-
tended the Rincon Grammar School,
and the Garcia girl worked in a pri
vate family in the daytime and im
proved her education in the evening
at the Silver-street night school.
It is thought the missing girls are
hiding somewhere in the city and are
afraid to go home. Neither need
have any fear of punishment for
their actions, as their parents would
be overjoyed if they would return.
The police are confident of finding
them and are instituting a diligent
search.
lon on the parlor sofaâ certain cushion,

ply delightful.. He had taken such an
Interest in her daughter, he said, and had
just driven his fellow . Directors to, see
with him what a valuable addition she
would be to the teaching force of the de
partment. At the next meeting of the
board she would be elected and assigned
to a school. And she was.
And when he was gone the little canvas
sack of dollars was gone, too. He had
sat on the sofa near a cushion of a certain
color. The $500 position passed from un
der the young woman when the new board
got down to work-,- and she haunts the
corridors seeking in vain.
Yesterday Judge Seawell modified his
order of injunction against the payment
of November-December salaries till in
debtedness was deducted from each war
rant. By this the Auditor can provide
for her two months' pay. And there are
others, but they will never dare tell their
stories in full detail. Moreover, nothing
damaging could be proven, and only vex
ation would come of an attempt at an ex
pose.
Audit those demands "subject to the
restrictions hereinbefore set forth."
This helps the teachers not one whit to
ward payment, and is another case of
hope deferred. This morning Judge Sea
well will render a decision in the man
damus case of Georgia Morse vs. Auditor
Wells. Whatever this will be, there is no
probability that matters will be improved,
because a judicial order for the payment
of January salaries will bring a fresh in
junction from the merchant creditors.
"My days are full of trouble and my
nights full of dreams," said Auditor
Wells yesterday. "Those teachers are
coming to me, some with tears and some
with threats and scoldings. They seem
to think I am standing in the way. I am
worried over the question, fearing that I
will do some illegal act, and on top of my
trouble j then down come the teachers
after me. It is' their money and I would
gladly audit every bill, but I dare not.
Even in the face of a court order I can
not act contrary to the instructions of
General Dickinson, my attorney. Even if
I were to pay in obedience to* an order
and the Supreme Court should reverse
that judgment I would be liable and other
creditors would come down on me and my
bondsmen". I am sorry for those teachers,
but I cannot act at my personal risk."
Yesterday City and County Attorney F.
"V. Lane, after carefully reviewing the
four Injunction suits now pending against
the Board of Education, advised that
body that "there is in existence no in
junction or restraining order In any man
ner restraining the Board of Education
from auditing or allowing the claims or
demands of merchants, or for rent."

Highbinders Disturb a
Performance.
WILD PANIC IN A THEATER
CELESTIAL ACTORS SECOWERED
WITH OVOID MISSILES.
Police Suspend a Much-Abused Free
List at the Jackson-Street
Temple of Art With
; Dire Results.
The simultaneous explosion of two bam
boo bombs and a dozen eggs of the vin
tage of '84 in the Jackson street Theater,
last night, drove the thousand or more
Celestials who were celebrating the New
Year by a visit to the playhouse pell-mell
from the theater In search of a fumlgant,
and caused a stop to be put to the drama
until the actors could remove the odor
that had been served to them.
Highbinders are supposed to be respon
sible for the disturbance created, and It
is probable that some arrests will be
made to-day, If the culprits are not put
to death in the meantime by their out
raged countrymen. When Lieutenant
Price took charge of the Chinatown dis
trict the highbinders, and not the owners
of the theater, seemed to be conducting
the place. They entered and left the play
house at will without even the formality
of presenting a pass. The lieutenant sus
pended the free list, and since that time
all highbinders have looked alike to the
doorkeeper. Last night three members of
the Suey Sing Tong presented themselves
at the door of the theater and calmly no
tified the man in charge that they guessed
they would see the play without paying.
The doorkeeper informed them that they
had another guess coming, and a police
man escorted them to the street. .
Shortly after this occurrence two bombs
were exploded in front of the stage by
parties, who escaped by the Fish alley en
trance, but It is believed by the police that
the guilty ones are members of the Suey
Sings sent Into the theater by the men
who were refused admittance. The ex
plosion of the bombs was a signal for
other highbinders in the gallery, who im
mediately began a bombardment of the
actors with a choice collection of eggs
that ripened long ago. The Celestial
Thespians fled, seeking refuge behind the
scenes, but they took with them an evil
odor, while their gaudy raiment had as
sumed several new and striking hues.
Pandemonium reigned In the theater
after the explosion of the bombs. Think
ing that another murder had been com
mitted the audience arose as one man
and made for the doors. The police were
on the scene almost as soon as the re
port of the exploding bomb was heard,
and finding nothing serious had occurred
forced the thoroughly frightened China
men back Into the theater and ordered the
management to proceed with the play.
The drama, however, was lame and halt
ing after that. There were hitches that
jarred on the supercritical audience, tor
no theater-goer can admire a hero who
half strangles every time he gets a sniff
of himself, or sincerely grieves with a
heroine who lets her blind sister perish
In the burning factory while she digs
scrambled eggs out of the back of her
neck. . *
- So it is only natural that those disap
pointed theater-goers should scorn the
proffered aid of the barbarian police and
go gunning for the wreckers of their en
joyment on their own hook. A week or
a month in jail would be no punishment
for the miscreantsâ short of death
would fit. their crime, so it is likely that
the morning sun will break upon long
rows of defunct Suey Sings corded up
along Jackson street, ready for the
Morgue wagon and a newly dug hole in
the City Cemetery.
DR. FARRELL IS HERE.
Brings Good News From the Cali
fornia Boys in Manila.
Dr. P. J. H. Farrell, captain and assist
ant surgeon in the First California Volun
teers, arrived In this city yesterday on
the America Maru from Manila, and im
mediately went to the Palace.
Dr. Farrell has been invalided and is
on a thirty days* leave of absence, with
permission to visit the United States.
The doctor's leave is caused by the return
of his old trouble, a wound in the left
arm which he received during the Soudan
war. Notwithstanding his affliction, he
looks remarkably well and was glad to
get home. '*' v. *-'-'.
"The first thing I want to tell you
about," said Dr. Farrell, " is regarding
the health of the California boys in Ma
nila. It is excellent and will remain so
as long as they are in the hands of Sur
geon Major William D. McCarthy. The
last call to arms just before I left was
on December 26, and the entire regiment,
with the exception of forty men, fell In
for duty. Out of the sixty-eight at the
hospital twenty, who were convalescing,
responded with their fellow soldiers. It
was reported that there was some firing
by the Filipinos and the men were
marched out to where the fighting has
since been. /
"The people can have absolute confi
dence in the regiment, because the army
at large recognizes the ability of Colonel
James F. Smith and repose the utmost
faith in their commander.
"The Filipinos have not a ghost of a
chance in the present conflict. They
know absolutely nothing about modern
warfare, and the extent of their mili
tary tactics Is to build one line of
trenches, from which they can be' dis
persed in a single charge. After they are
in the open field their chances of suc
cess are reduced to an infinitesimal mini
mum." â  . r

COLLAPSED FROM THE
EFFECTS OF THE BLOW
JOHN FARRELL KNOCKED SENSE
LESS IN A PRIZE-EIGHT.
The Referee, Principal, Seconds and
Others Imprisoned Awaiting the
Outcome of His Injury.
It would seem about time that the
Board of Supervisors close down on
granting permits to mushroom athletic
clubs which give alleged monthly fistic
entertainments. The farcical exhibition
presented by the Mission Athletic Club
in Teutonla Hall last evening ought to
decide the City Fathers on the danger of
licensing boxing bouts by untrained
youths.
That John Farrell is not reposing on a
slab in the city's Morgue is due to the
Police Department, through its represent
ative, Sergeant Coogan. . Fortunately he
was present during the alleged entertain
ment, and after being assured that a rep
utable physician had thoroughly exam
ined the combatants he allowed the first
pair to proceed. Farrell and Jack
O'Brien, two "dubs," were pitted against
each other. O'Brien outweighed his rival
by ten or twelve pounds, but Farrell pos
sessed grit and a little more science and
held more than his own until the first
part of the sixth and last round, when he
received a light tap on the shoulder and
fell to the floor and was counted out. His
seconds aided him to his chair, and it was
found necessary to carry him to the
dressing room, where restoratives were
applied to bring him out of his comatose
condition.
Believing him in danger Sergeant Coo
gan hurriedly detailed one of his men
to visit the dressing room and learn his
true condition. He immediately reported
back that the man was unconscious, and
Coogan rang in a hurry wagon call. While
the seconds worked over their man the ;
police did everything possible to resusci- !
tate him, and on the arrival of the patrol
wagon he was placed in it and dispatched
at full speed to the Receiving Hospital.
Dr. Tormv, who was on duty, pronounced
Farrell in no danger, and ordered him
put to bed. He afterward stated that
the pugilist had a weak heart, and his
failure to respond when knocked down
was due to exhaustion.
The police then gathered in the princi
pal, seconds, referee and president, and i
escorted them to the City Prison, where j
they now languish, awaiting the result of
Farrell's condition. Those arrested were: j
Referee George J. McLaughlin; seconds- \
John McDonald, Richard McDonald and
Eugene Mulligan; . William J. Bell, presi
dent of the club, and O'Brien who fought.
During the exciting Incident Frank
Kiley and James Riordon, two 150 pound
"dubs," battled for supremacy. Unliâe j
the previous bout, this was of the laugh- |
able order. Neither man knew much about
the game, and both simply swung and I
clinched to their hearts' content. After j
exerting themselves for six rounds a hu- i
mane referee declared the burlesque a
draw.
Next came "Kid" Hogan and Charles
Vickers, who fought at 145 pounds. This
bout was really an exciting one and re
deemed the unsatisfactory contests that
preceded it. Hogan was far the cleverer,
but Vickers seemed to have a peculiar j
habit of letting fly his right on all occa
sions. In the first round both men scored I
knockdowns, and after that both fought j
each other to a standstill. At the end of
the sixth round a draw decision gave un- |
versal satisfaction.
The event, of the evening was to have
been an eight-round go between Con Ryan
and William Ford, two rival Missionites.
Sergeant Coogan received instructions '
from Captain Spillane to prevent the men
meeting, and he ordered the bout off. The
m-.ley gathering then filed out and an
other poor exhibition -was a thing in his
tory. -.. Â. . .-.>;â :

Berwith's Jury Disagreed.
The jury in the case of Albert J. Ber
with, who was charged with murder in
having killed Arthur Brown in the Globe
Hotel, on Howard street, on the night of
November 20, 1898, disagreed. The case
has been on trial In Judge Lawlor's court
during the week, and was concluded yes
terday afternoon, when it was given to
the jury. After remaining out the greater
portion of the afternoon' the jury was
brought into court at 10 o'clock last night
and stated to the court that It would be
impossible to agree.
Accepting this view, Judge Lawlor dis
charged them. It was ascertained that
eight of the jury favored conviction and
four remained obdurate for acquittal.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
â¢ NEW YORK. Feb. 10.-The stock market left '
off with advances in the leading specialties and i
prominent railways, with the tone unsettled.
â¢The dealings were largely professional and ]
were in the nature of contracts over the triple i
â â¢holiday. The early trading was practically I
â .featureless. Commission . houses had but few '
orders and the trading for London account was :
â¢ In very moderate volume, without any marked !
/tendency. Aggressive buying of Burlington
dissipated the early hesitancy and had a fa
vorable Influence on the market generally. The
coalers showed perticular strength, as did New
York Central, Pennsylvania and the grangers
' generally. The usual refunding stories, which
.lacked official confirmation, were revived in
connection with Burlington's strength. Pacific
. Mail recovered an early decline, which was at
â¢ tr'ibuted to advices that the steamship sub
sidy bill was unlikely to pass. Sugar displayed
'strength, while Tobacco was weak most of the i
:. day. The further successes about Manila had I
, a. Sentimentally beneficial Influence on values, j
Prices rose until delivery hour, when there was
, a : brisk selling movement, but stocks were so !
â¢ well taken that a rally ensued In some quar- ;
ters -In the final dealings and the market closed â¢
over the holidays, to be reopened Tuesday i
â  morning. Meanwhile the bank statement will
appear and much importance attaches to its
character.
Railroad and miscellaneous bonds were in
good request throughout the day, with gains
of importance in some Issues. Total sales
â $3% 650,000.
United States 4's registered advanced V. and !
the s's registered % In the bid price.
Stock prices this week were extremely vari
. able, with a contraction in dealings compared
With the recent large volume. Comparative
prices show great irregularity, with losses pre
â¢ Tailing. The uprising at Manila exerted a dis
turbing effect, but speculators were Inclined to i
view this incident as assuring the ratification '
of the Spanish peace treaty. According to
the traders' view the disposition of this mat
te* would be favorable to stock prices, lnas- I
. much as it would remove one of the uncertain- !
â¢ ties of the situation. Therefore there were
purchases of stocks In anticipation of the
â¢* Senate's action, although there were many con
fusing advices as to what that would be. Lon
don took a more optimistic view of the an
nouncement that the treaty had been ratified
â¢"by the Senate than that displayed by the local
traders, who, following their custom of reallz
â¢ ing profits on the culmination of what they
regard as favorable news, sold freely Tuesday
morning and -prices receded very materially.
"A rally set In about noon the following day and
continued until the closing dealings of Thurs
day. This in turn was followed by advances
on Friday, coincident with the announcement
of the second success of the Americans operat
ing against the Filipinos. The transactions
for London account were pretty evenly bal
anced for the week, and to-morrow's shipments
from London of American securities it was
believed would bring the last batch that Lon
don had sold. These sales In recent weeks, it
was calculated, were equal ln . value to about
$35,000,000. These sales resulted in easier mone
tary conditions abroad, while at the same time
money appeared In abundant supply locally,
there being loans of as low as 2 per cent for
call money." This is partly due to America's
receiving, in part payment of * her large trade
balance, large amounts of gold from Australia.
The uncertainty and hesitancy in the earlier
part of the week may be attributed largely to
the unfavorable Interpretation â¢of last week's
bank statement and the curtailment of dealings,
and the uncertain tone of the market later
may be accounted for by speculation as to
jhe probable showing of this week's bank state
'â¢ ment. Notable advances for the week were
, Lake Erie and Western preferred 3%, Metro
politan Street Railway 2 and Consolidated Gas
â¢8%. The declines Included Tobacco 8, Pltts
.burg. C. C. and St Louis 6, the preferred 5%
â¢ and International Silver 2%. There was more
'.stability to bond prices than in stocks, al
â¢ though values of the speculative liens fluctu
â¢ ated ln accord with the Mock speculation. The
'" Mini-speculative Issues assumed considerable
prominence during .the week en reasonable |
buoyancy oX these mortgages, tending to create i
strength in the general market.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says*.
The market here was heavy to-day. The set
tlement restricted business, but the tone .was
firm and after the settlement the Inclination
was to buy. Americans were completely life
less, the dealers in them not even forming a
group on the center of the floor, owing to the
settlement and four holidays. In the street
they were hardened slightly on New York pur
chases of Pennsylvania and the coalers. Tlntos
were 9 13-16 â¢on the rise and 25s in copper.
Anacondas were 9 13-16, Utahs 7%, Bostons
2 7-16.
Money was much wanted for the settlement
and there was considerable borrowing at the

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â Bradstreefs Financial
Review to-morrow will, say: Heavy realizing
sales and liquidation of speculative holdings
caused an * irregular decline of values In the
first half of the week, followed by an equally
irregular but well-marked rallying tendency.
The declines appeared to be the result of an
overbought condition, large amounts of securi
ties having passed at the recently high prices
into the hands of speculative holders, who
were discouraged by the symptoms of reaction
displayed last week and the evident slacking
of the public buying demand. Large Interests
of the street were apparently disinclined to
take any very active part or to encourage a
resumption of the general advance under condi
tions which would unquestionably have resulted
in profit taking on \an ' enormous scale and in
further selling here by . London. When the j
selling movement on Wednesday became rather :
severe ln its effects and received ln some stocks I
incipient breaks there was, however, ample
evidence that support was extended to the *
market, and the rally which ensued prevented
the more or less appearance of manipulation
from such quarters. Such action wan rendered
more effective and easier by the considerable
short interest which had accumulated for some
days past, the smaller professional operators
displaying an Increasing tendency to act on
the bear side of the account for a turn. The
whole market this week has shown the presence
I of the regular speculative . element to an â¢ In
creasing extent, while the volume of commis
sion house business has shrunk to more normal
proportions. The dally transactions have also
decreased considerably, although they have
still been large enough to Justify the descrip
tion of the market as a very active one.
DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
i NEW YORK. Feb. 10.â R. G. Dun's Weekly
Review of Trade. will say to-morrow:
The solid basts 'for good business has . not
been shaken by speculative reaction. Stocks
: have been slightly lower and the market Is all
the safer because much unsoundness and un
j reason have been shaken out. Speculation ln
I wheat, which . ; for a â . time depressed prices,
has also taken a turn, and with heavy ex
-1 ports, the . market tends upward again. The
i cotton movement Is not essentially speculative,
i but based on reported injuries, and holds * Its
1 advance. Meanwhile dispatches from all parts
; of the country show extraordinary activity in
the chief branches of trade and a business
much larger than a * year ago in nearly -all.
The heavy excess of exports oyer Imports con
-1 tinues, New York exports having been ln I five
weeks 16 per cent larger than last year, while
; Imports have been 9 per cent larger.
I In wheat Americans are getting profits, even
I though prices are lower than they . were some
! months ago. After some yielding the price !
I rose to 79.85 cents, and the May option rose
%c. .During the week the Atlantic exports
were 3,926,692 bushels, flour Included, against
! 2,174,921 last year, and total exports. â  including
i the Pacific, were 4,647,405 bushels, against 2 -
I 960.515 last year. : *â â¢ ------ - â¢ . "â¢ â¢
Western receipts , have been $.056,456 bushels
against 2.957,770 for the week * last year,, while
corn expeorts for the week were 3,102,609 bush*

stantly taking more - wheat or corn from ' us
than ln any previous year. The cotton market
is in slightly stronger position because .. for
eign buying continued beyond precedent, while
home Indications now point to a smaller crop
than was expected. The stocks on hand are
heavy, both commercial - and mill, t but foreign
buying supports the rise in prices thus far.
What wool is â  worth In view of the great
stocks yet unconsumed few are able to Judge,
and that fact hinders adjustment of prices for
goods. Sales have been small, only 6,475,400
pounds at the three chief markets for the
week, against 5,303,200 last year, and 9,175,900 ln
I the same week of 1897, but this year and in
I 1897 the buying has by no means represented
j consumption only. While quarters and half
blood wool and Delano have been in demand
| and firm, the quotations indicate weakness in
Ohio and other fleeces.
The Iron industry is so exploited by con
solidation and attempts of that nature that Its
wonderful prices have not reflected distrust.
Instead there have been general advances in
pig because the demand has been large for
Bessemer at Pittsburg to $11 40 and gray forge
to $10 75 and in finished products because
nearly all are in demand beyond the capacity
of works for some time to come. The advance
of 10 cents per keg ln wire nails by the asso
ciation was not caused by any special pres
sure for supplies, but rails have advanced $2
per ton and bars $1 because of urgent demand,
especially at Philadelphia and Chicago, for
several thousand cars, and plate mills are
everywhere overcrowded. At the same time
the many negotiations for consolidation of In
terests arrest trade ln some quarters and dis
turb It in others, causing unusual irregularity
in prices. The pipe consolidation appears to
be stopped for the moment by opposition of one
company, but the activity is greater than ever
before. About 20,000 rails have been sold at
New York, half for a Nova Scotia road.
Failures for the week have been 217 In the
United States, against 295 last year, and 35
in Canada, against 43 last year.
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, Feb. 10.â Bradstreet's to-morrow
will say: That some favorable effects are like
ly to follow the atmospheric changes of the
week is evidenced by reports of improved dis
tribution at retail of heavy winter goods, while
the effect on spring trade, appears to be chiefly
regarded as one of retardation rather than of
positive injury. In leading staples the strength
of prices Is still a feature, all the gains made
in January being sustained, if not further im
proved. Some reflection of the cold wave is
found in the advance in wheat, showing an
inclination to concede some damage to the
winter wheat crop, in view of claims that snow
for protection is lacking in many sections. In
aggressive strength, alike of demand and price,
however, Iron and steel are easily flrst this
week, and the list of advances reported this
week is almost a roll call of that Industry's
products. Among the advances noted might be
mentioned barbed wire, steel rails, Southern,
Eastern and Bessemer plgiron, nails and wire
plates, the most strength being exhibited at
Western markets. Copper Is again higher and
quotations are now not far from those made in
the great French corner which burst ten years
ago. Spelter and lead are also higher, but tin
shows some reaction In the speculative move
ment. Weather conditions have not favored
the lumber trade, but reports, particularly from
the hardwood branch, are still very favorable
and prices exhibit all their old strength.
Hides are firm and some activity and advance
!n leather is reported. A fair trade Is doing ln
wool and a rather better tone is reported ln
the woolen goods market. Anthracite coal,
favored by weather, is active.

reported having shipped 864,000 bushels of wheat
this week. Under such influences the niarkei

lower at 72%@73c, with more sellers than buyers
at the bottom figure. After half * .. hour or
fluctuations measured by %c range . the price
of May gradually Improved to 73% c. and naa
scarcely reached that point before it began
to tumble back to 73c. Reports from the stock
taking centers indlcatad little change In tne
visible either way. "Vestern primary mar

with 443,000 bushels a year ago, while the sea
board clearances of wheat and flour were â¢***â¢Â«â¢
amounting to 865,000 bushels. On the otner
hand, however, foreign advices were very dis
couraging and the seaboard had no shipping
orders except of merest retail kind. 'here
were several rapid fluctuations between .*Â»
73% c. but near the end. under selling by inter
est! which have recently been good buyers.
May sank until 72% c was reached, and at me
close there were sellers at 72*A*f'2%c. __.__

doing in this market, especially in free moun

also some Southern ; spring, from 7c to i S%c.
Scourers are â  looking around a little more for
Wool, but cannot pay the prices asked for some
of the Wools which have been consigned under
a limit, - and scoured Wool â¢is still a drug in
the . Eastern markets. : Some* Oregons and Ne

. FAMILY RETAIL MARKET.
Eggs are much cheaper and very plentiful.
Butter is dearer. Cheese is unchanged.
From present indications housekeepers will J
have to pay high prices for meats for some j
time to come, as cattle, sheep and hogs are
scarce and steadily getting scarcer and prices j
are rising every day or so.
The Poultry market is only moderately sup- !
piled and prices are firm in consequence. Game i
ls cheaper and plentiful.
Fruits and Vegetables show no changes
worthy of note. A good many Potatoes are
coming in frostbitten by the recent cold snap.

OPPOSES THE SANTA FE CONSOLIDATION
An Effort to Defeat the Effects of the Measure Which Will
. Give the State a New Line in Competition
With the Southern Pacific.
.CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
â  MENTO, Feb. 10.â Governor Gage has
assumed the right to dictate to the Sen
fa te. of the State of California as to what
: it. shall do, and has selected one of the
least popular members of the Demo
i crat -minority to act as his mouth
>piece. : ;
;â¢; Very naturally the Senate, and par-
; ticularly- the majority members of the
â¢Senate, object to being made the in
' â nru-rhents by which the Governor per
:forms the wonders of his will. This,
.hv*\v_ver, is a small matter when com
pared with the indignation that is be
ing manifested because the Governor
; ; has selected Sammy Braunhart, the
.Senator, from San Francisco, to act as
.-his. herald. It is bad enough, they say,
:. tO, have the Governor of the State at
tempt to dictate the course of the su
preme law-making body, but to have
: : him. promulgate the dictates of his
will through Braunhart is an insult not
'â '. to : be overlooked or to be allowed to go
-unpunished. So it is that the word has
been passed around that Braunhart is
to be sat upon, it being understood that
the sitting process is to be applied only
.in: such matters as concern the will of
â 'â â¢the Governor.
â . â The particular bit of legislation that
â¢has induced the Governor to attempt to
: constitute himself the upper house of
'â  the. 'legislative branch of the State
/government concerns the consolidation
of .the lines of the Atchison, Topeka
and Santa Fe and the San Francisco
and San Joaquin Valley railroads. A.
.brie- history of this proposed legisla
tion will be necessary to a full and
:. complete understanding, of the Gov
â¢'. ernor's action.
;â¢>â¢ '-.Early in the session Senator Simpson
â¢ â¢ Introduced a bill in the Senate author
.',â  izing the purchase or lease by a rail
road of roads or portions of roads be
longing to another railroad. It should
be- understood that when the Valley
â  road 'was purchased by the Santa Fe
it, a* necessary to close a gap of about
eighty-three miles between the present
terminus of the Valley road on the
northern side of the Tehachapi and
the northern terminus of the Santa Fe,
oh the southern side of the mountains,
in order to make a continuous trans
continental line to San Francisco. In
order to cover this break at the least
expense the Santa Fe effected a con
tract-with the Southern Pacific Com
pany by which certain roads owned by
the Santa Fe in Mexico were ' trans
ferred to the Southern Pacific Company
in -return for the right to use the line
of the Southern Pacific Company over
the eighty-three miles between the ter
minus of the Santa Fe and the ter
, m-inusof the Valley road. The bill in
troduced by Senator Simpson was in
.tended to legalize this transfer of in
- T s
-Simpson's bill was referred to the
â¢ Committee on Corporations, where it
: was considered. The committee con
sidered that certain alterations in it
â would be necessary. It was then agreed
â¢ that- a substitute bill containing the de
sired -and necessary changes be sub
â¢ mitted to the Senate and recommended
for * passage. It was at this point in
the- proceedings that Senator Braun
hart- appeared on the scene with a bill
which' he proposed to have substituted
for "the substitute bill agreed upon by
the- committee. Braunharfs bill, when
-Vcfutinizred. was found to contain pro
visions -which practically defeat the
â¢purposes fir which the proposed legis
: lafioii is. intended. ,
.'it was just here that the fine Italian
hand' -of the Governor was made ap
: parent. In defense of his proposed sub
stitute. Braunhart stated that he rep
'â¢' resented Governor Gage in the matter
and that the substitute bill was drawn
up 'at* the Governor's request and in ac
cordance with the Governor's views on
the subject: that the Governor was not
: five-Table to the bill proposed by the
coTnhrittee and that if it were passed
.â 'by the Senate he would veto it. In re
ply' t-d' this astonishing statement
Braunhart was informed that while
Mr. Gage is recognized as the Governor
of the. -State he must not seek to con
stitute-himself the Senate of the State;
-that' the Senate will pass such laws as
it deems just and proper and if they
do-not meet with the approval of the
Governor he can exercise his right of
ve*tQ*.;'.also that the Senate can pass the
'.laws-over the Governor's veto.
.Braunhart having been properly sat
upon land through him the Governor,
. : substitute bill of the Senator from
Pranclsco was voted down and the
committee formulated its report re-"in
'm'endhig' for passage the committee
substitute bill.
Braunhart now declares his Intention
to' act as the defender of the Governor
on the floor of the Senate when the bill
comes up for final passage and will at
tempt to substitute the Governor's bill
for it. In the meantime the Senators
are nursing: their wrath and awaiting
a favorable opportunity to demonstrate
to the Governor that he is not the
"whole show." '
GOVERNOR'S ACTION AN
- INJURY TO THE STATE
Many years ago, when the Atlantic
and Pacific Railroad, backed by the
capitalists of the Santa Fe corporation,
.was extending a line of railroad from
Albuquerque to the Pacific Coast, the
Southern Pacific stepped in to block the
extension. In order to checkmate the
Santa Fe the Southern Pacific mana
gers rushed in and constructed a line
from Mojave, on the desert, east to the
Needles, on the Colorado River. There
fore in order to get Into California the
Sfinta Fe was compelled to lease from
the Southern Pacific the line from the
Needles to Mojave. ' Accordingly a
thirty-year lease was negotiated.
Now the Santa Fe has acquired the
Valley road, also the line from Los An
geles to San Diego, and to make the
â a-stem complete for consolidation
agreed to purchase from the Southern
Pacific the line from Mojave to the
Needles. In return for this line the
Santa _**_ agreed to give the Southern
Pacific a line from Benson through
Mexico to Guaymas. .2 - â *.- 7 .
The Santa Fe people now come to the
Legislature as a Federal corporation to j
secure legislation enabling them to j
carry out this agreement so that their j
system may be consolidated and bonds j
issued. If the Santa Fe were a Cali- i
fornia corporation legislation would not ]
be needed, as they could under existing
statutes purchase from' the Southern
Pacific the link from Mojave to the
Colorado River. :....
When the bill was submitted it is
said that Governor Gage was appre
hensive that the measure might pre
clude competition and therefore he sug
gested an amendment. The Santa Fe
managers incline to the opinion .that if
the amendment should be adopted the !
purpose of the measure, that is to say, !
the complete consolidation of the Santa
Fe interests, would be - defeated.
The Southern ' Pacific managers are
not opposing the original measure.
They hold in escrow the deeds to the |
line from Benson to Guaymas and are
anxiously awaiting 'legislative-authority!
to make the bargain effective. In the '
Assembly Judge Dibble and Mr. Mead
understand the situation. They have :
maps and documents to explain the de
sires of the corporation. . . . .
EVIDENCES OF HASTE
IN THE SENATE
Members Are Anxious to flnrry
Up the Most Important; '
Matters.
CALL. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 10.â The Senate is showing
a desire to hurry matters a little. The
end' at the * session . is approaching 'â . faster
than the bills are being considered and
passed upon. The first symptoms of haste
appeared, to-day, when Senator Smith
produced a resolution providing for night
sessions of the Senate, and another symp
tom showed itself to-day in the resolu
tion by Smith of Kern to form an urgency
file and later in a discussion precipitated
by Boyce of Santa Barbara, when he
asked to withdraw one of his bills on the
second reading file and substitute another
one farther down on the same file.
Senator's Smith's resolution to form an
urgency file was referred to the Commit
tee on Rules. It provided that next Tues
day morning each member of the Senate
should be allowed to name one bill to be
placed on the urgency file, which would
insure its early consideration.
The consideration of the second -reading
file was then taken up, and when it had
proceeded as far as Senator Boyce's bill
No. 15., Senator Boyce rose and asked to
be allowed to withdraw that bill- and put
in its place on the file his bill numbered
36, over one hundred numbers farther
down the second reading file.
Senator Rowell objected. He did not
want bills jumped around the file unless
the one substituted was of a nature simi
lar to the one withdrawn. Boyce, in an
swer, declared every Senator had a right
to the place of a bill on the file, and
should he wish to withdraw a bill his
right to the place allowed him to substi
tute another bill on the same file. â¢ â 
"There will be a great deal of business
transacted in this Legislature before the
end of the session, and it will be neces
sary for Senators who have important
bills far down on the file that have been
unavoidably, delayed to advance them in
some way. I want this thing decided now,
and I move that Senate bill 36 be put in
the place of Senate bill 156 on the file, and
that I be permitted to withdraw number
156. 1 want a rollcall on this motion and
I will abide by the decision of the Sen
ate."
Senator Leavitt supported Boyce's mo
tion, but Luchsinger called attention to
the opportunity which such a privilege
would give for the getting of useless bills
on the file for the purpose of holding a I
place. Davis did not bjtfieve any Senator!
would resort to such a subterfuge. He j
thought Boyce's motion a good one, for
it expedited legislation by getting rid of
one* bill at the same time that an impor
tant measure was advanced for consider
ation. He thought, however, it was wrong
to have a new bill sprung suddenly on the
Senate when they had probably studied
the bills on file just ahead, of the session,
for the purpose of becoming familiar with'
them. r. :â¢.â ,*. â¢;â â¢
As several Senators thought there was ]
something in this point Mr. Boyce made
this formal motion to lit the caseâ that
any Senator may substitute one of his
own bills on the same tile, provided, how
ever, that the bill so substituted cannot
be passed to a vote on tin- same day with
out the unanimous consent of the Senate.
Senator Smith had all along been trying
to catch the eye and recognition of the
chair, and just there he got his opportu
nity. . -:-. v *-.â¢â ? V*.'.' '"--'â¢â¢-"->-â¢.:
"This motion would overturn the whole
system of rules in force in this Senate,"
he said. "1 object to this jumping of bills
forward on the file, and I object to the
consideration of this motion. It should be
referred to the Committee on Rules. We
all have Important work to do here which
often takes us away from our seats in
the Senate, and we must have some as
surance that while we were away some one
has nut jumped a bill forward on the file,
and we have been deprived of the chance
to vote for or against it. I make the point
of order that this motion effects a change
in the rules of the Senate, and therefore
should go to the Committee on Rules be
fore being considered here." -
The point of order was declared to be
well taken. â  . -y
Then Senator Leavitt moved to suspend*
the rules and pass Senator Boyce's mo
tion. Davis supported the motion to sus
pend. "Suppose you had a good bill be
fore a hostile committee," he said, ."and
it has been delayed,** there ought to be
some way .to bring it forward for early
consideration." ..'.
Gillette thought* the motion might to go.
to the committee, and then, by a vote of
17 ayes and 22 noes, Leavitt's motion to
suspend the rules -was lost and Boyce's
motion on substitution went to the Com
mittee on Rules.
It will probably be fixed up to allow of
substitution, but not immediate consider
ation, and. will * then be . reported upon . fa
vorably.
Senator Wolfe submitted two bills on
the Pacific Coast "Exposition in the Senate

sion to have charge of the exposition and'

also to appropriate $500,000 of the State

The first bill provides for a commission

The commission *is to -handle- all moneys

Senator Dickinson introduced a bill ap
propriating $25,000 to pay the claim of
Claus, Spreckels for money "now being
due and owing." This is the money' ad
vanced by Mr. Spreckels to aid the
drought sufferers. *
Senator Dickinson also introduced a bill
appropriating $18,000 for the,* contingent
expenses of the present session of the
Senate. â¢ -

A SOLID DAY'S WORK
IN THE ASSEMBLY
â CALL. HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. To-day "has been one
of .good solid work In the Assembly: For
the past two weeks bills, have been piling
up on the files and the committees have
been so busy with rapidly accumulating
legislation that little time has been given
to. the actual passage of measures be
fore the House. ' Now, however, that the
third reading file is well filled the legis
lators realize that they have got to be
up and doing in order to ; get things over
by the time their pay stops, or spend an
other thirty days at law-making without
any compensation. â¢
The only matters that dam. up to-day
to interrupt routine work were the unique
veto messages of the Governor, and the
case of Milton J. Green, charged with
contempt. The Governor's messages took
up no more of the time than was re
quired to read them and the -Green mat
ter went over for another week without
any debate. Fortunately the bills them
selves gave rise to no speechmaking and
second and third reading proceeded
smoothly. xXi.'-2- ,â _>",',_-/ ;â¢'â ;..;
The Assembly special file was dispensed
with on motion of Dibble and the Senate
special file became the matter of first at
tention. Senate bill 31, by Taylor, re
lating to the annexation by municipali
ties of adjacent territories, was passed
iS*V& third reading, and so was Senate
bill 12, by .Dickinson. , Dickinson's bill is
designed to prevent the maintenance
against the State, or any officer thereof,
by any county or county officer, of any
action for the recovery of money alleged
to be due such county or officer for ser
vices rendered, in the assessment, equal
ization, auditing or collection â¢of adva
lorem taxes. â  Dickinson's bill, relating .to
the : relief of J.- N. E. ; Wilson, ex-Insur
ance Commissioner, and his bondsmen
was also passed to third reading. Senate
bills 42 and 43, amending the Civil and
Political Codes, were put through '* the
same course. .-Â«.-, - â¢ r
Senate concurrent resolution s,**' by
Boyce, which provides that a room in 'the
Capitol shall be set aside as an offlce for
the Lieutenant Governor, was adopted
without a dissenting vote, and an offlc-s
__â -- be furnished for Mr. Neff as soon as
the Governor shall give his signature to
the resolution. Davis' bill, providing for
the construction of a free wagon road
from Mono Lake basin to the "Tioga"
road, was passed on the file by 'request
sent in from- the. Senate by 'the author.
On Assembly third reading file "As-*

it provides a legal mode of procedure by
which corporations owning property in
foreign countries may dispose of the
same. It was passed after an explana
tion by its author. . Assembly bills 691
and 75 were both passed on the file. The
flrst is the committee substitute for An
derson's bill prohibiting the Folsom di
rectors to dispose of prison-crushed rock
to private contractors. The second is the
original bill. Johnson's Assembly bill 4,
creating an exempt fireman's relief fund
in counties, cities and towns of the State,
was passed.- ...ckard's Assembly bill 376.
which would have given the Labor Com
missioner the power to appoint a half
dozen or so deputies in every town in the
State was due for its third reading, but
was passed on the file, at the request of
the author. Upon the suggestion of Mead
of Los Angeles, the bill has been so
amended that deputies may be appointed
in six of the' largest cities of the State. I
McKeen's Assembly bill 57, relating to
the establishing of crematories and the
cremation of dead bodies, was so amend
ed as to make cremation not compulsory,
and then ordered back to the printer. As
sembly joint resolution 17, a substitute for
for Assembly concurrent resolution 8, by
Cowan, relative to the Importation into
this country of Japanese women and la
borers, was adopted and ordered trans
mitted to the Senate. Assembly bill 88,
by Sanford, establishing the line between
Mendocino and .Trinity Counties, was
passed on the file at the request of the
author, who is waiting for more data to
back up the fight that has been opened
against his measure by the friends of
Trinity County. Chynoweth's bill to pro
vide for the organization of county fire
Insurance companies was passed.
In setting forth the intent of Assembly
bill 354. which prohibits the. desecration of
the American flag. Dibble of San. Fran
cisco made a glowing speech, which, won
him the applause of the House and sent
his bill through without a vote against it.
Assembly bill 352, by the same author, re
lating to the. disposition of the estates of
the deceased inmates of institutions sup
ported in part or in whole by the State
was also passed. - . ....">> -..

The second anniversary, ball given by

The hall had been beautifully decorated

when the signal for the grand march was
given at 9 o'clock to the delightful- strains
of music by an orchestra on the stage,
hidden by luxuriant palm foliage, over
400 couples participated. - *

their escorts In full evening dress, formed
a most attractive procession, which was;
led by E. J. Dollard, president of the
council, arid his wife. An excellent pro

MOTHER, SON AND TWO
DAUGHTERS IN JAIL
Arrested on Suspicion of Having
Robbed a House on Tele
graph Hill.
LOCKED tip In one of the tanks at the Central Police Station are a moth
er and her two daughters, while in an adjoining tank 4s her son, an
â¢ ex-convict.* The quartet is being held secretly by the police pend
ing an investigation into the midday- robbery of a residence at 1414
Kearny' street, on January 30. ; ' - â¢' â¢ - â â¢" ... 'â â -.-â 
The mother's name is Mrs. Margaret Tierney, and she resides with a
married daughter at' 315 Green street. Her two daughters,- who are accused
of complicity in the crime, are Mrs. Thompson, who lives at 1412 Kearny
next door to the scene of the robbery, and Amelia Tierney, .a 14-year-old
girl, who has been living With Mrs. Thompson. Their alleged confed
erate is named "Kid" Tierney, a notorious character on Telegraph Hill,
and Is commonly called "the Kid." â¢ -â¢ ... .*> .
A week ago last Monday Mrs. Jessie McCloud, the victim of the rob
bery, locked up her house and with her children went to Oakland to spend
the day. Before her departure the Tierney girl came into ttfe house and
learned of her intended visit. l Upon her return, late in the afternoon; Mrs.
McCloud discovered the basement* door, which she had carefully locked
before she went, aw ay, standing wide open, and 'on entering the house
found her effects scattered all over the premises. Further investigation
showed that a window opening into the rear of the basement had afforded
means of ingress to the* thief or thieves. Part of the sash had been cut
away and one pane of glass broken out so the fastening could be reached. 1
Four gold rings, a silver, watch and some other things, including bits of
ribbon, laces and the like, were missing. " Mrs. McCloud reported her loss
to the police, but it was she who discovered the first clew that led to the
arrest of the quartet. :....-.--.â  772 : 7 - â  â¢-.".-' 'â¢' r 7 ; : i â ",.-â â ."â¢..'â¢
Last "Wednesday she was passing a pawnshop in that part of the town
when she saw one of her rings displayed in the window. Mrs. McCloud
summoned a policeman, and with him entered. the pawnshop. The pro
prietor said that Mrs. Tierney had brought .the ring to him a few days. be
fore and wanted to exchange it for one she had previously pawned
with him. The broker consented to the exchange', and the woman took her
own property away, leaving the stolen ring in its place. 7*y'x
' The officer reported the discovery to the detectives who had been de
tailed on the case, and Mrs. Tierney was arrested Thursday. She told
the officers that her daughter Amelia had. given her the ring, and so the
girl, together with her sister, with whom she was living, was gathered in.
The three were kept apart for- the time being, and Amelia was subject
ed to a rigid examination by the detectives. At first she denied all knowl
edge of the robbery, but finally she 'said that her brother had met her after
Mrs McCloud went away and proposed 'that they' break into the house.
She had remained-outside to give the alarm' should anybody approach, while
"the Kid" forced the window and ransacked the place. He gave her the
ring as her share of the plunder, and she had given it to her mother to keep
for her. **. __ .._- _â,,,, ,
Acting on this information, the officers soon found "the Kid" in one of
the Telegraph Hill resorts, and he, too, was carted out to the hall. He
admitted having met his sister on the day of the robbery, but declared
he had nothing to do with it more than to' act as scout for her while she
broke into the place. .'â¢'-â â ' -'-...-
His story is rather transparent, for it is hardly probable that a girl
could cut the window sash In the manner it -was cut and scatter things
about as they were.. It is more likely that both went into -the house, and
while the Kid searched for valuable* the girl gathered up such trifles as
pleased her feminine eye. . .â¢â¢â :. ... ..- -...-.. â â '..." Â

to continue its â  discussion of : the water j
rates. The tabulated statement which
was furnished by the Spring Valley Water
i Company was j not .in such a form' that
the Supervisors could analyze it criti-

definite action* in the matter and contin
ued the inquiry until next Wednesday
night.
According to the statement of the rep

PARTIES GREATLY MIXED
EX-SENATOR MOFFITT ON THE
DEMOCRATS.
The Work Before Election Will Be
â â â â '"â¢''. Largely Done by Individuals
in a Quiet, Undemon
strative Way.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â 'â  * : - 90S Broadway, Feb. 10.
'..' All the municipal party tickets are on
..file* and all talk of compromising between
r.any two parties is now ended, as the
â â : names on file must all so on the official
â 'ballot. There are six tickets from which j
the voters can choose: Republican, Dem- j
ocratic, Independent, Populist, Municipal
League and Prohibition.
â¢.There yet remain ten days in which in
. dependent candidate, can file tickets. But
after February SO everything must be
-closed up, and there will remain exactly
three weeks from that date in which to j
make the campaign. Apparently it Is to,
', be- largely a campaign of individual ef
. fort. Since last summer the city has been ,
; satiated with politics and everybody rec- j
** ognizes that it will be an impossibility '
to. draw out the voters night after night
for the next month. Particularly is this :
the case because there are so many par- ,
â  ties, and complications would certainly
: follow. 'There is little, difference between
the Municipal League and Republican
tickets, but this difference is very pro
nounced. Arthur H. Breed is on the Re- !
publican ticket for Auditor and D. C. j
. Hinsdale is the League nominee. It has i
: frequently been rumored that one of j
: these gentlemen would withdraw and ac
: cept a deputyship under the other, but
this is positively denied, and there seems
.to be no doubt that the battle between
'. them will be fought out at the polls.
-..Next week all the City Central Commit
tees will meet and decide on the meas- i
'.* Ores to be taken in behalf of their respec- j
tive tickets.
.*-*. The Democrats are still divided among*
themselves and a story has been circulat- i
ed, that a deal was attempted between
' Arthur Breed and several Democratic
leaders by which Breed was to have re
â¢ ceived the support of the Democrats in
return for giving them a deputyship in
.'case of election. This story has been af- j
firmed and denied.
â¢'â¢.Frank J. Moffitt, whose name has been ;
frequently mentioned in connection; with
. Democratic politics, gave an interview to- '
>' cldy in which he expressed his views of
the Democratic ticket. He declares that
â¢he. had no interest in it, other than as a
'.Democrat, and that he would have fa
vored a Democrat rather than John L. I
â¢Davie for Mayor. He declares he has
â¢ never met five of the seven ward Coun
cilmen on the ticket, and does not know
-.them. In conclusion Mr. Moffitt said:
.*' If any one will take up the 147 gentlemen
âWtifi composed the Democratic convention they
wiil'at once conclude that no one could run
â ' .'f Fiem.' and so far as the new City Committee
' frs erned it compares favorably with the old.
;J- C. Bullock in the First Ward la Quite as good
-.'_,- man as Dick Wallace; Leslie McKillican in
;. the second will answer as well as Mr. Erick
_<in. i*, E. Daiton and Hiram Luttrell In the
â¢â¢6i_th "Ward will satisfy the Democrats there
.'a**- much, as Charley O'Gara,* and so on through- j
. out* the entire city. Speaking of the City Com
.-mittse. I will say that I have spoken to no j
â 'member of It upon the matter of its conduct. j
-excepting Mr. Laymance, which was explained !
â¢.-in'tHe Breed episode.
"."â¢â¢â¢Now." said Mr. Moffitt. "there are five ;
"hundred men ln this city who are familiar
â¢.With the absolute truth of every word I have
â UK /-'red, and I will subside if any reputable
-.â¢man In .this city can truthfully say anything
.. [the. contrary. So far as E. W. Woodward's
'candidacy Is concerned, I can only say that
"â â¢that mess is a Republican row with which I
; have nothing to do. Woodward is the appointee
â 'â or. -a Municipal League Mayor, and those people
."must take care of and be responsible for their j
: b'wri. This if- more talking than I have done
'In" this campaign, and more probably than I ;
. wjn do again, and I would not even now say i
thrÂ« much did I expect to be here at election j
. time."

A Child and a Firecracker.
ALAMEDA. Feb. Melville, the four
year-old son of Police Officer Brown, was
saved from a horrible death at noon to
day by the timely awakening of his
father. The little fellow had been playing
with firecrackers in the morning and
shortly before noon exploded one in a
clothes closet in a room adjoining that in
which his father was sleeping. A fire
started and the flames hail ..gained con
siderable headway when the smell of
smoke awakened Brown. Rushing into the
room he found the child stupefied by the
smoke and the flames gradually creeping
toward its clothing. Brown carried the
little one to a place of safety and re
turned to fight the fire. He held the
flames in check with buckets of water un
til the Fire Department arrived. The
damage to the house and contents will
amount to considerable.

SHE HEARD BRANDES
BEATING HIS CHILD
IMPORTANT TESTIMONY AT THE
MURDER TRIAL.
Judge Hall Taboos Side Remarks
That Were Passed Between
the Attorneys.
1 OAKLAND, Feb. 10.-Shortly after the
' trial of William A. Brandes, the accused
| child-murderer, had been resumed .this
! morning, Judge Hall was prompted to
; place a vigorous quietus upon side re
' marks made by the attorneys.
Deputy Coroner Streightif had been
' asked a question by Attorney Bennett for
â  the defense, when Deputy District Attor
â  ney Melvin suggested to the court that
witness be permitted to refer to his notes
<to refresh his memory. Bennett here
hissed, "Help him out!" Attorney Melvin
seriously objected to such side remarks,
saying they were made simply to preju
, dice the Jury.
In tabooing "side remarks," Judge Hall
said: "Let us have no more of them. They
only tend to prolong this trial, annoy
counsel and vex the court. When attor
neys have objection to offer, do so in a
â  proper manner."
Witness Streightif was on the stand all
| forenoon and most of the afternoon. The
! principal feature of his testimony to-day
was that, in his opinion, the marks found
' on Lillian Brande's neck at the time of
â¢ her death were not such as are usually
found in cases where death is due to
â¢ hanging; moreover, there was no bubbling
mucus or froth at the mouth. Witness
had concluded that there was something
wrong, because Brandes appeared excep
tionally nervous, and also was anxious
j to have the burial as soon as possible.
Henshell J. McDonald, a reporter on a
: Berkeley paper, was next called. His tes-
I timony in the main was in relation to a
i visit to the Brandes home on the morn
ing of November 10 last, the day of the
girl's death. He stated that Brandos had
asked the Deputy Coroner "to be easy
i with him."
Mrs. M. Godfrey, of Piedmont, the next
witness, testified that she was a visitor
â¢ at Brandes' home a night or two pre
vious to the girl's death, and that she
heard Brandes beating the child and curs
: ing her.
. "I heard him say 'I'll beat you to death
if you don't produce that money. I'll kill
you,' " said witness. "Then I heard a
sound as If a body was being thrown
against the wall, and heard the child cry
r 'Oh, Al, AI; please don't; I haven't got
the money.' "

AMATEUR BURGLARS
VISIT FIVE STORES
.V: \; Oakland Offlce San Francisco Call, DOS Broadway, Feb. 10. ,
FIVE stores burglarized and a feather and a photograph the only booty
obtained by the, prowlers. This is the record of a peculiar crime com
mitted early this morning.
On the north side of Thirteenth street are five little stores, occupied
by a milliner, a sewing machine agent, a real estate man, a picture frame
dealer and a photographic supply firm. All these places were entered by the
burglars, whose object ln covering so much territory is not apparent to the
police or the proprietors. '-.//-,- â *â¢;*< "â  "*J 'â ".â 
The thieves, who were evidently amateur burglars, entered one of the
stores by going through the blook on Washington street that Is being re
modeled by M. J. Keller. Afterward they went through all five of the
stores and pried open -the places in which they evidently expected to find
money, but made no attempt to carry off the sewing machine, picture,
frames, real estate signs â¢or trimmed hats that were all around them. One
pretty ostrich feather is missing, as is also a small photograph of a partic
ularly handsome young lady from the photograph store. There was no
money in any of the places visited, and there is some doubt as to whether
the whole job was an injudicious 1 freak of a gang of boys, or was under
taken by those who seriously Intended committing burglary.
An examination" of the premises to-day by the detectives led them Into the
belief that the burglars were scared off by a burglar alarm that was set
up in one of the stores. This alarm had gone off* during the night, but no one
had heard it. x7~-X 7:7XÂ±77'*Xx7'2 :i -'7 7X_j7?7x7\7-.
The burglary bears some resemblance to the work of the youthful burglars
who terrorized Oakland three years ago. â

Blackburn's Case Set
for Tuesday.
JUSTICE WAS UNDULY TARDY
RESULT OF AN ATTEMPT TO
DO SOME SHOOTING.
The Political Wheel Having Taken
Another Turn, There Is No
Desire for Condign
Vengeance.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 10.
Next Tuesday the interesting trial of
Leslie Blackburn, the well-known politi
cian, for exhibiting a deadly weapon to
the fear of William S. O'Brien, will come
up before Judge Smith in the Police
Court.
This case has been before the courts
for nearly seven months. Long before the
last county campaign started and when
it was understood that Mr. Blackburn,
the old-time sergeant-at-arms of the
Senate, was a candidate for that honored
position, he met Mr. O'Brien, another pol
itician, and there was trouble. Black
burn drew his gun and Mr. O'Brien
thought himself in such bodily dan
ger that he had the ex-sergeant-at-arms
arrested. .
Mr. Blackburn was tried for an assault
with a deadly weapon, but this would not
stick, and the matter would probably have
ended, but politics and not personality
was at the bottom of the feud, and
O'Brien was persuaded to swear out an
other warrant charging Blackburn with
exhibiting a deadly weapon.
Justice has not been in a hurry in deal
ing with these politicians, and the case
has dragged on and on. Judge Allen gave
way to Judge Moore, who in turn left the
cause celebre as a legacy to Judge Smith.
The trial has been continued from time
to time, and when it was called a few
weeks ago there was neither complaining
witness nor defendant present in court.
Judge Smith set the case for next Tues
day, and should no one appear It is not
improbable that it may be stricken from
the calendar, and this is no doubt what
the political principals most desire at this
date so far distant from the rime me al- j
leged crime was committed.
SPORTS DISSATISFIED.
Talk of "Fake" Before the Reliance
Club.
OAKLAND, Feb. 10.â In the eight-round
contest between Charles Rochette of San
Francisco and Joe Lavigne of Berkeley,
which came off at the Reliance Club head
quarters to-night, Lavigne was given the
decision in the fourth round. The fight
did not come up to the expectations of the
spectators and all bets were declared off.
There was a great deal of dissatisfaction,
some declaring that it was a "fake" and
that Rochette appeared all too predis
posed to lay down.
The eight-round contest between Jack
McMahon and Charles Thurston resulted I
in a knockout for the former in the third
round. McMahon proved himself a clever
worker; besides, the man from the
Princeton Athletic Club has been unable I
to get down to the 130-pound weight by
about five pounds, but the victor allowed I
this to go by.
The other main event, also an eight
round contest, between "Doc" Flynn of
the California Rowing Club and "Dick" i
O'Meara of the San Francisco Athletic
Club, was stopped at the beginning of the I
fifth round by Chief of Police Fletcher.
O'Meara's nose had been broken In the
previous round. He appeared to be suf- I
fering intensely, and had to be practically j
lifted into the ring by his seconds. Jim \
Fox acted as referee for the evening and
Hughes of iÂ»*e Acmes and Seronl of the
Reliance Club were the Judges.
Jordan on New Mexico.
OAKLAND, Feb. 10.â Professor David
Starr Jordan lectured to-night at the
Unitarian Church on the "Enchantment
of the Mesa." The lecturer dealt with
his trip to New Mexico, and declared that
his discoveries proved that a certain por
tion of New Mexico, which is supposed to
have been never inhabited, had certainly
once been populated. Professor Jordan
and his parly found evidences of human
life sufficient to overthrow the statements
of those who had preceded him.
AMATEUR ATHLETES MEET.
Pacific Association Assumes Jurisdic
tion Over Boxing and Other Sports.
The regular monthly meeting of the Pa
cific Association of the Amateur Athletic
Union was held last night, with J. R.
Bockman of the Ariel Rowing Club in the
chair. John I. Nolan of the Ariel Rowing
Club was elected to the board of managers
to succeed J. R. Bookman. S. S. Peix- I
otto, delegate from the Columbia Park
Boys' Club, was also elected. A letter |
was read from the secretary of the ath- i
letic association of the University of Call- j
fornia refusing payment of the fee for the '
sanction of football. P. J. Franklin,
delegate from the University of Califor
nia, said that the university does not re- !
gard football as falling under the juris
diction of the Pacific Association, but i
undertook to set the views of the asso
ciation before the university, and to rec
ommend payment of the sanction fees for
1897 and 1898. which are still unpaid.'
President J. R. Bockman, after pointing
out that rowing is not mentioned In the
constitution of the Amateur Athletic
Union as one of the. sports under its ju
risdiction, suggested that the Pacific As
sociation ought to assume jurisdiction.
The president appointed the following com
mittees: Finance committeeâ J. I. Nolan, H.
Hauser and S. S. Peixotto. Committee on cre
dentialsâ A. P. Rothkopf, H. A. Keeler and
Julius Vf. Morton. Committee on gamesâ P.
J- Franklin, C. Dole and H. A. Keeler. Com
mittee on recordsâ H. Hauser, George James
and S. J. Pembroke. Regatta committeeâ I.
XNolan, W. C. Espy and A. P. Rothkopf. The
â¢following commissioners were also appointed
by President J. R. Bockman: On rowing. W.
C. Espy; on swimming, H. A. Widemann; on
â football, C. Dole; on track and field athletics.
P. J- Franklin; on boxing. George James; on
handball, Julius W. Morton.
Considerable discussion ensued concern
ing the boxing tournament Viowk being
held at the Olympic Club for the Herman
Oelrichs belts and gold medals, no sanc
tion for which tournament has been asked
for or granted by the Pacific Association.
George James, captain of the Olympic
Club, pointed out that the tournament j
Is governed by rules formulated by the
club, and is regarded as an amateur af
fair. While an attempt has been made to
exclude well-known professional boxers,
he admitted that some of the men entered
would not receive registration as ama
teurs if they applied for it. It was de
cided that the tournament now in pro
gress would not be interfered with, but
that the clubs in the association should
be notified that the association assumes
jurisdiction over boxing, and that appli
cation must be made to the board of man
agers of the association for permission to
hold boxing tournaments in the future.
A. P. Rothkopf, George James and H. A.
Widemann were elected registration
commissioners for the i ensuing year.
Clubs which are not members of the Pa
cific Association may on application re
ceive its sanction to hold amateur sports.

SIR: As you are good enough to ask me
as to the object of my visit to America
I have much pleasure in informing you that
:I. am most anxious to obtain an opinion
from some of the American Chambers of
Commerce with regard to the future devel

!'â¢/. If the American Chambers of Commerce
are kind enough to give me an expression
of their views on this subject it would

honor to represent. I remain,

Lord Charles Beresford.
velopment of the trade of all nations.
This policy Is embodied in the expression, '
'the open door." In other words, main
lain the treaties as they stand at present,
and thereby preserve the Integrity of the
Chinese nation. But unless the Chinese
assist themselves by the organization of
an army for police purposes. Internal dis
turbances are sure to occur, which will
result in the breaking up of the empire,
and the 'sphere of influence' policy will
become inevitable. Such a policy would
eventually lead to war disturbing the in
terests of trade and commerce.
"The 'open door' policy is the most
gigantic question which has presented it
self for solution this century. It could
easily be carried out by the four great
powers most interested in the trade of
China, insisting that the Chinese Govern
ment should place its army in effective
and efficient organization under Ameri
can, British, German and Japanese of
ficers, the details to be arranged between
the four powers and China. These four
powers have no desire to acquire Chinese
territory and by that means be in a po
sition to put on a tariff, excluding all oth
er nations from trade, but they have a
right to ask it that they may protect
their treaty rights.
"American trade and commerce is go
ing up by leaps and bouds, but there is no
security for it now and none for future
development. To give you an idea of
American trade. I can state that during
the last ten years the importation of
American cotton has increased In quanti
ty- 121 per cent, and in value 59*4 per cent.
English cotton has decreased in quantity
13*. per cent, and in value s"_ per cent.
English trading interests do not suffer in
China, so far as English merchants are
concerned, because the English merchant
buys the American cotton and ships it to
China in British bottoms, where it is sold
to the Chinese. The importation of Amer
ican machinery, railroad material and oil
is also rapidly increasing.
"Regarding the Russian occupancy of
Manchuria. I shall hold that a country has
a perfect right to take any steps which it
thinks will be to the advantage and in
terest of Its people; hut our business is to
see that while this is being done our own
toes are not stepped on. Russia has, by
the best computation, a military force of
over; 100.000 men In Eastern Siberia and
north of China (Manchuria), out of which

When asked what he considered the
most important lesson of the late war
with Spain, the admiral's eyes sparkled
and his face glowed with enthusiasm as
he replied: __â --Â *..â .-.*:â --. ;
"The lesson we derive from the late war
is one which history has repeated over
and over again. That is, that good men
and good officers, good discipline and good
organization under a first-rate leader al
ways win in action. -When an admiral can
organize his fleet so as to inflict a crush
ing blow on his adversary with little dam
age to himself, the victory is considered
by some as being too easy to be of much
consequence too cheap to be good; but
It should be considered a masterpiece of
strategy, combined with perfect organiza
tion and discipline. The American people
are justly proud of their recent victories,
but the best ships and the best trained
crews are useless in action unless com
manded by a brilliant leader, who adds
to his qualifications a master mind to en
able him to place his fleet quickly in a
position of advantage. The Americans
have such a man in Admiral George
Dewey. **--g*-___l-Â»_te_M*.
"The very astonishing performance of
the battle-ship Oregon, in her long run
from San Francisco to the scene of hos
tilities in the Atlantic, challenged the ad
miration of naval men throughout the
world. Her operations are a magnificent
tribute to her builders, but we must not
overlook the accomplishment of those
who drove her through the waters, from
the commander to the firemen in the hole
below.
"The Nicaraguan canal Is a magnificent
enterprise and will be a benefit to the hu
man race. It would benefit the trade and
commerce of the world, and particularly
America and England. Tf there was a
difficulty with regard to the Clayton-Bul
wer treaty, which I do not believe for a i
moment, I would use every influence I
might possess for a public man to have i
that diffleutly settled.
"I am most heartily and earnestly in
favor of the so-called Anglo-American
alliance. Alliance, perhaps, is not the
Word. An understanding between two
kindred people of the same blood, origin,
sympathies, laws and chivalrous, gener
ous sentiments, is far stronger than any
alliance based upon paper agreement or I
problematic issues."
His Lordship gracefully declined to
publish his views on the American ex
pansion policy, increase in army and navy
or any other American question upon
which the public mind is strongly di
vided.
"You pay me a great compliment," he
said, "in asking my opinion upon such
matters, but I do not consider that I am
in a position to discuss them in any way
whatever. I have always felt that nations
know their own business best, and these
are essentially American questions."

A PRETTY V ALLEJO GIRL
DROPS OUT OF SIGHT
Jlnnie F. Brooks, a Country School Girl
Whose Love for the Metropolis Led
JHer to Desert J_erJ_ome.
_ _ VHEN pretty Annie F. Brooks left her home in Vallejo just two weeks
1 If ago she little realized the pain and sorrow she was inflicting on her
111 mother. Since her sudden departure, the cheerful home-life has been
broken and now the distressed parent Is in the city- supplicating the Po
lice Department to aid her in recovering her child. I '"
Last Thursday night she visited police headquarters to learn what
success the officers of the law were having in their search, and while awaiting
the arrival of the Chief she told a pathetic story of her daughter's 'disappear
ance.
The mother of the girl is Mrs. Thomas Nixon, a well-known and esteemed
resident of Vallejo. Her husband, who accompanied her, resigned his position
at Mare Island for the purpose of aiding in the restoration of the daughter to
her mother.
Annie, who is a beautiful child by her former husband, S. M. Brooks, a Jus
tice of the Peace and wealthy resident of Ashe County, North Carolina, lived with
them in Vallejo. She had no cares or worryâ simply living a school-girl life with
frequent visits to her aunt who lives in this city. During the past year the
young girl became tired of a country existence .and spent a great deal of her
time with her relative. A week ago last Saturday she came home and informed
her mother that she would have to return to San Francisco the same evening.
As she had just come from San Francisco her mother firmly refused her request
and the daughter seemed satisfied. Shortly after the refusal she asked and ob
tained permission to go to the Postofflce, and since then she has not' put in an
appearance. ' ; V
The distracted parent instituted inquiries with little success. She was aided
in her search by her husband and Mr. Acock, proprietor of the Waldorf of Vallejo,
and a very, dear friend of the family. The latter later learned that his barkeeper,
Emmett Conley, had thrown up his position and left town. As he was a close
friend of the missing girl it was immediately surmised that he had a hand in her
disappearance. ... 77i:77X}.-Â£7
Investigation developed the fact that Miss Brooks had entered a closed con
veyance and was driven rapidly over to Benicia and then boarded a .train for
San Francisco.
The missing girl is attired in a tan tailor-made' suit and a lavender silk
waist. She wore a large ostrich feather, hat, and her hair was dressed in. the latest
approved pompadour. style. Miss Brooks is only 17 years of age, and is five feet
two inches in height. She has dark hair and eyes and regular features. The
young lady has always had a longing for the stage, and with a view satisfy
ing her desire for a footlight existence she has studied elocution with success.
The missing girl has.been frequently seen about the city escorted by a
friend, and as the police have her picture and description it is very likely she
will be taken into custody, as she is under age. It is said that Ed Robison and
Amos Howard,, two well known young men of Vallejo, have knowledge of her
whereabouts, but refuse to inform the anguished mother. '
Mrs. Nixon promises that if "her baby", returns to her she will say not a
word in rebuke. She says that her daughter ; fears being put under restraint if
she returns, but the mother promises she will not be. Mrs. Nixon's first hus
band has recently written her that he wanted to see ; his : daughter and ' signified
his willingness to pay her expenses to his home in North Carolina. 'f
While anxiously waiting* tidings' from her misguided* daughter, Mrs. Nixon
continues a personal search. She Is almost : distracted over, her loss and is unable
to sleep through the thought of her child being away : from her. s * ,
She again visited the Chief's office, last "evening! but gained no further infor
mation about her -i daughter. ; ' ." , '..'â¢-*

j of 1 per cent per month, purporting to j
have been signed by the late millionaire ;
William Murdock, the Colusa County !
rancher, which has long been the subject ;
of wonderment throughout half the conti
nent, has been branded as a forgery. j
This note, with interest, now stands ;
against the estate of the dead millionaire
as a liability amounting to half a million
dollars. If it is a forgery, as
claimed by Chief of Police Lees and
the best experts in the country, backed
by the testimony of a witness, J. F.
Turner, who has told the secret of its
existence, claim that such it is, the efforts
of Becker,' the looter of the Nevada Bank, j
and all of his ilk will fade to those
of petty larcenists beside this gigantic
conspiracy to swindle the estate of the
dead capitalist. It is the forgery of the
century, and for the greed of its perpe
trator-, their daring and reckless pursuit
of gold that it was never intended they
should share stands without a precedent
in the annals of modern crime.
A few years ago William Murdock died
in this city, full of years that had known
incessant toil. He left a vast estate as
well as a niece. Mary Helen Murdock,
who had long enjoyed the old man's re
spect and his love. The old man had been
but a few months in his grave when a
note, payable to Mary Helen Murdock,
bearing date of September 5, 1877, its
back disfigured by various assignments,
was presented for settlement. The repre
sentatives of the estate stood aghast
when the note was presented, but it was
not paid. Suit for the recovery of the
face <f the note, with interest as set
forth, bringing the amount due up to the
sum near $500,000, was commenced, and is
now pending in the Glenn County Superior
Court. On April 4 next it will go to trial,
and E. S. Pillsbury of this city and At
torney Lusk of Chico, who represent the
Murdock estate, are confident that they
can prove the instrument a forgery, and
are preparing their case with that end in
view. The deposition of J. P. Turner has
been taken, and will be settled and signed
to-day. This will place in the hands of
Mr. Pillsbury the whole story of the forg
ing of the document, backed by document
ary evidence, which will doubtles defeat
the effort to loot the estate of the dead
capitalist as well as seriously increase
the troubles of one or more well-known
citizens. -â¢.*.â¢.
At the time of Murdock's death Turner
was a well and favorably known real es
tate dealer of this city and was enjoying
a : big income. The forgery, or alleged
forgery, of the note occupied his atten
tion for a time, and although he was in
no way connected with the alleged swin
dle except for the purpose of obtaining
evidence against those who launched it,
it led him into a mire of trouble, from
which, after a bitter legal battle, he has
just succeeded in extricating himself, and
is now in a position to tell his story
against those who would give their all to
see him behind prison bars. His deposi
tion is an unusual one, in that it sets
forth a story seldom heard in a legal trial.
Stripped of its legal phrase, and ques
tion and answer lorm. Turner's deposi
tion contains the following story. He
started his story before Notary Mark
Lane by telling how Lawrence S. Meggin
son, whom he accuses of having forged
the note, came to his office in the spring
of 1892, when he (Turner) was at 4 Sut
ter street. He continues: .
Claiming to be 111 at the time and finding
that Turner had nice sunny offices neatly fur
nished. Megginson wanted Turner to let him
make them his headquarters and have his
mail come there. Turner, the deposition sets ,
forth, consented, and also gave Megginson on*; j
of the steel boxes in his safe to keep his l
papers in. It was not long before Megginson
told Turner about having a note for $100,000
against William Murdock, Ollmpo. Cal., dated I
September .**., 1577, and due September 5, 1897, !
bearing 1 per cent per month interest. He i
told Turner that the note would amount to
$480,000 when due, and that he had bought it !
for ',000. He told Turner that Murdock had
a pet niece whose name was Mrs. Minnie Mur
dock, and that Murdock .had given his niece '
the note because he thought more of her than '
a-ny one else. He told Turner that Murdock
was an old bachelor and had been sick a great
deal, and that Minnie had always taken care
of him when sick and that the old man would
always pull Minnie on his knee and kiss her
whenever he got the chance, and: that for a!
long time prior to the making of the note he j
had promised Minnie that some day he would ,
make her a nice present. Megginson said the
time came when the old man handed Minnie
the note and said to her, "Here, Minnie, is a i
note that will come due about the time I die, i
and with care it will be all the money you ;
will want the balance of your life." Meggin- |
son also said that the old man told her that he
would leave ample property to pay the note
when due. Megginson then told Turner how
he got acquainted with Mrs. Murdock. whom I
he called Minnie, and told how she had taken !
a great notion to him and had told him all
about the note.
He said that Minnie was a very nice person
and she had always stopped at the same house j
where he lived when she came to the city and I
that she had made a confidant of him. He i
then said that Minnie was afraid she would '
have trouble with the Murdock heirs about the
note, so had agreed to sell him the note for i
$80,000. He then said she had assigned the note j
to him and he had assigned it to his brother, I
William Megginson, in Ohio. Megginson then
told Turner that he was to pay Minnie only '
a few thousand dollars of the amount until it '
came out of the estate, but to make the con- I
sideration right before the heirs he was having
his brother send him $5000, $6000 and $10,000 at a
time, and he was having it come through the
bank, and as soon as he drew it out of the
bank he would take it to Minnie, pay it over to j
her, take her receipt and then at once take j
the same money and send it back to his j
brother, and then in five or six weeks his j
brother would send it back again and he would '
make another sham payment, and so on.
In this way he was paying the $80,000 to show
the consideration all right.' "Well," he said,
"while he had about $10,000 of his brother's
money, he wanted to let his brother out of it
and get some one to go in with him and stand
half of the expenses all through, and when the
old man died make the fight against the heirs,
and after the $80,000 was paid and all expenses
the balance could be divided with whoever
went in with him." He also said that Minnie
had another note for 120,000 that she had got
from a banker at Sacramento, which she was
to turn over, to him for. the -$80,000, so he would
put the whole matter together, which would
amount to over 1600,000 when due, and there
would not be over $100,000 to pay out.
It was about the hist of June, 1892, when
Megginson began to make the offers to Turner;
He then showed Turner the note, and when
Turner questioned him about the -onsiaerubun
given for the note the rtrst thing M-ggin.un
did was to show Turner two deeds signed by
William Murdock before a Notary Public,* and
he said: "You see there is no doubt about
the signature 'oeing William Murdock's, as it
compares exactly with the- signatures on the
deeds." Turner then noticed that one of the
deeds was dated in 1873 and the other one in
1890, and that both deeds were for the same
piece of . land. Megginson then told Turner
that the last deed was given to correct an error
in the description in the flrst deed. Turner then
noticed that the name on the note which was
dated September 5, 1877, compared exactly with
the name on the the deed of 1890.
â¢ Turner did not then let on to Megginson what
his suspicions were, but kept questioning him
In many ways, Megginson thinking that Turner
intended going in with him. Turner then asked
Megginson what guarantee there 'was that Mrs.
Minnie Murdock would not come back on him
for the whole amount, after the estate was
settled, if he did go in and bear half of the
expenses. .Megginson then said he would bring
Minnie, as he called her, and Introduce her,
and she would tell Turner that the whole mat
ter was left to him. Megginson did bring a
woman to Turner's office whom he introduced
as Mrs. Minnie Murdock, and said: "Now
Minnie will tell you all about the note her
self." She then told Turner. that she had as
signed the note to Megginson for -f^OOO, and
that anything that Mr. Megginson did would
be entirely satisfactory to her, as she had left
the whole matter in his hands.
About this time Turner took Megginson down
to see C. P. Robinson, an attorney, as Meggin
son was very uneasy about his mode of pay
ments. He wanted to make sure that he could
not get into 'trouble -with, the Murdock estate
people. 'â â â  Megginson and Turner. went together
to ask Robinson some legal questions about the
assignment of the note - and the mode of â¢ his
payments for the same. Megginson seemed to
be very uneasy about the way he was having
his brother send the money here. This was in
September, - 1832. Megginson, about this time
went over to Oakland to stay a . few days to
avoid the service of a subpena upon him from
a party who wanted to take his deposition, and
while over there he wrote to Turner, on Sep
tember 20. 1892, asking him to see Robinson
about some matters in connection with ; the
note., :~**;'36_3gS_''j*BjUL^
This letter is now in the possession of
the attorneys representing the Murdock
estates and corroborates the statements
made by Turner. This letter the attor
neys are zealously guarding, and state
that the admissions made by Megginson
therein completely substantiate their con
tention that the note is a forgery, and it
will be, after Turner's deposition, proba
bly the first evidence introduced on behalf
of the estate tending to ; substantiate the
contention of forgery.
Turner then told . Megginson that he
would not go in with him unless he (Meg
ginson) would tell him the whole truth,
as he did not believe the note was gen
uine. Turner told Megginson that he be
lieved the note was a forgery, and that
unless he took him (Turner) into his con
fidence and told him all about It and just
how it . was obtained, ho ' (Turner) would

refuse to consider the proposition. Turn
er, however, gave Megginson to under
stand that he would go in and fight the
matter through if he would tell him the
whole truth.
Megginson then took Turner in
his confidence and told him all about
the matter. Megginson then showed
Turner just what the note looked
like when it was signed by William
Murdock and what it looked like
after it was in his hands a few hours.
â ' Still with this marvelous statement
Megginson claimed that Minnie, as he
called her. or Mary Helen Murdock
(which is her name), believed up to that

uncle had signer! the note for her for $100.
--000. dated September 5. 1577. Still the note
presented for payment was not signed, it
is claimed, by the dead man.
The ignorance of Mary Helen regarding
the note is explained by Turner in his
explanation of how the note was forged
Turner, after he gained the confidence of
M. Vinson and the latter decided to tell
Turner all, listened, he says, to the fol
lowing story of the forgery of the note-
Shortly prior to Murdock's death I called the
attention of Miss Murdock to the fact that
her uncle had promised her a present some
time before, and I told her that if she would
take a note which I would draw for $100 and
get her uncle to sign it I would then raise it to
1100 000 and set back the date a score or so of
years. Mary Helen Murdock did not like the
scheme and said she would draw up a note
for the full $100,000 and get her uncle to sign
It as she believed that if she rushed in and
aÂ«ked him to sign it he would do so without
looking at the note. She crew up a note for
jinn 000 and then handed it to me and I placed
It in my pocket, being afraid that the uncle
would read the note, refuse to sign it. and ruin
our plans. When Miss Muruock wanted to get
the note signed I handed her the one I had
drawn up for $108. She rah off thinking that
1 had handed her the note for $100,000 in her
handwriting. She came back In a few min
utes handed me the note : and said that her
uncle had not even looked at the note, had
signed it, and handed It back to her. In fact,
she had not looked at it herself, and did not
know that it was the on**. I had drawn for
1 then took the note and excused myself. I
went away Intending to ra'-'se the note, and It
immediately dawned upon "me that it was not
in Miss Murdock's handwriting and she would
immediately discover the deception. I then
took the note she had dra**Vn up and endeav
ored to forge Murdock* Sj signature, but I
made a botch of it. In Consequence I had
two useless notes on my '-.hands. I procured
another blank note and traced and copied Miss
Murdock's handwriting in the body of the note
and then took Murdock's signature from the
deed referred to, which was drawn in 1890,
and traced it in part and copied the rest. Next
morning I presented it to â¢'Minnie" and subse
quently it was assigned to me.
Sucn is the story of the forgery, and
Turner avers that later the note was as
signed to Megginson's brother, William,
who resides in Ohio. Turner, after he se
cured the story, refused to consider the
proposition of entering into the scheme,
and when L. S. Megginson found this out
he immediately lost heart and retrans
ferred the note to Mary Helen. Then the
safest way out of the difficulty and to
close Turner's lips was to have him ar
rested. Turner says, and this Megginson,
aided by one J. P. Frenna. did.
Through all these years Frenna and
Megginson have done their best to obtain
a conviction that would . stick against
Turner, but without avail.
Now Turner, who claims that the whole
thing â¢ was a blackmail -scheme for. the
purpose*- of beating him; out of" a- large
amount of property and covering up the
forgery, is going to start in on the same
two parties and show up the other side
of the case. He claims that every word
of the testimony given' by both Frenna
and Megginson was false and perjured
testimony, which he -says he can prove in
the courts. He is going to show his full
hand, which he says will astonish the cit
izens of the- entire State. He promises
revelations that will put him in a differ
ent light and make Megginson and Frenna
stir themselves to show that they are not
guilty of sundry and. startling crimes.*. .-.-

the testimony of Turner. Attorney E. S.
Pillsbury is confident in his position and
believes that when the case is finally de
termined he will have secured a judgment

to overstep, themselves *i and. fall . when
