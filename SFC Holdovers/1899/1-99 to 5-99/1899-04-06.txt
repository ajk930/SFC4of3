HUNTINGTON PLOTS

Railroad Magnate Seeks to

â was the signal to re

by the 'rfflrers of the railroad com
a sharp eye on rnil
;on were the. men
by Dan Burns to assist
in making his fight for an
sit ion which the representa
tive? ople refused, in rebellion,
to grant him. It was a matter notori
known to everybody that Dan
Burns was the Senatorial candidate of
iern Pacific Company. Hunt
n had publicly announced his pref
e for Burns, and Huntington's
preference became valuable through
the work of his employes.
This condition of affairs would have
created no discussion if the absurd
ambition of Burns had been crowned
with success. Hunting-ton has been,
for so long, a meddler in the political
affairs of the State that his interrer
ence in the recent Senatorial campaign
v ould have created no comment if
Burns had won. The defeat of the
Mexican, however, has completely
changed the aspect of affairs. Hunt
lngton seeks now to repudiate his own
actions, even his own words, and place
upon the long suffering shoulders of
Herrin a personal responsibility for
any railroad espousal of the lost cause
of Burns.
Huntington wishes the public to be
lieve that hi? servant spent the money
of the Southern Pacific, employed
lobbyists and wielded every influence
â¢within the grasp of a powerful cor
poration to assist Burns without any
authority from those who employ him.
The matter is of serious moment for
the railroad magnate realizes that it is
a dangerous faking, even in Cali
fornia, for hi: to show his hand and
then lose. He wishes the people of the
State to believe that William F. Her
rin, forgetting by whom and for what
he is employed, used the tremendous
power of the. railroad to satisfy a per
sonal friendship. Humington forgets
that the people of the State are thor
oughly informed on the incidents of the
Senatorial campaign which has iust
closed. He is striving to make of Wil
liam F. Herrin a scapegoat for actions
that look evil in the eyes of Cali
fornians.

or whatever the people of the State
think him to be, he is not guilty of the
ping Dan Burns before
the public. < '. P. Huntington is re
for that indecent exposure.
The incidents of the Senatorial fight
demonstrate this fact to
ft. It v ill bf remembered
M. H. de Young believed that he

in his candidacy for
t<>r. Practical poli
tician? and men of affairs knew that
the railroad people intended to dictate
the choice of the Legislature if it were
so. Mr. de Young be
â  that he I d Huntingdon's in
ement since he already had the
pupport of William v. Herrin. The
head of the law department had in
formed Mr. de Young th-it everything
ild do would br- in the- service of
the proprietor of the Chronicle. Re-
lying upon this assurance Mr. de Young
was buoyed up by a false hope. He
Foon learned that Herrin's personal
preferences played, however, but a
email l.art in the affair. C. P. Hunting
ton arrogated to himself the right to
name United States Senators for Cali
fornia. He declared in New York that
The San Francisco Call.
D. M. Rums deserved to be a Senator
and would be. That was before the
itive deadlock had become a seri
ffair and Huntington believed that
, a wish of of the Southern Pacific Com
pany was a command to State legisla
tors.
Huntington felt so sure of his ground
that he forgot his customary reserve
and made this declaration. That set
tled the case of De Young and gave
Herrin his instrnctions. When the leg
islative deadlock seemed likely to be
permanent Huntington shook his head
knowingly and said that "the Legisla
ture of California will elect a Senator
and D. M. Burns will be the winner of
the prize." De Young had judgment
enough not to enter the contest. Her
rin had received his orders and pro
ceeded with due diligence to execute
them.
The head of the law department Is a
political campaigner of experience. He
knows that it is not a pleasant task to
explain a failure and he left undone
nothing which might contribute to suc
cess. He arranged to be In direct com
munication with J. B. Wright, the
Southern Pacific division superintend
ent at Sacramento. Herrin had di
rect telegraphic communication with
Wright whenever he wished it, and D.
M. Burns held daily conferences with
Herrin through the medium of Wright
during the Senatorial campaign. Hunt
ington's orders were being obeyed.
As a matter of course the Southern
Pacific Company had other interests
at Sacramento as well as the Senatorial
fight. The railroad has always main
tained at the capital during sessions >>f
the Legislature a powerful lobby.
Money is spent, votes are hartered and
only trusted men are employed in such
delicate work. This year the Southern
Pacific, Compsr. 1 .- r-o!"<i Its interests.
The men who were chosen to watch
railroad legislation were commissioned
also to make the Mexican's cause that
of the railroad. The followers of D.
M. Burns were in the service of the
Southern Pacific Company. The ex
penses of these men, incurred in ad
vancing the cause of Burns, were paid
by *he Southern Pacific Company. The
distributor of railroad passes was one
of the trusted supporters of Burns. Th>
campaign of the Mexican was the cam
paign of the Southern Pacific Company.
In fulfillment of his duty William F.
Horrin conducted this campaign. He
Interviewed legislators, used every
weapon of the railroad, indorsed expen
ditures of money that belonged to his
employers and fought with such energy
that when failure came the Southern
Pacific Company and not William F.
Horrin stood discredited with a. dis
graceful defeat. And now Huntington
seeks to throw upon his faithful servant
the odium of his own commands The
crafty railroad magnate has a.f'o in
volved General Hubbard in his scheme
of evasion, but the imposition, it is
believed, is not serious. General Hub
bard is credited with being wiser than
he talks. At all events the pr-ople of
the State do not always believe all they
hear.
Particularly is this the fact when the
people of California hear C. P. Hunt
ington say that William F. Herrin. on
his own responsibility, used railroad
money, issued railroad passes, paid
railroad lobbyists and exerted all the
strength of railroad influence to elect
I). M. Burns a United States Senator.
In the presence of witnesses William
P. Hc-rrln declared that his personal
choice for United States Senator was
M. H. de Young, but his personal
choice counted for nothing as the In
structions of his superiors were to labor
for D. M. Burns. Herrin is reported to
have said that he wanted De Young
but the railroad wanted Burns and
there all discussion must end. Even
Huntington can see the absurdity of
the assertion that Herrin used all the
power of the great corporation to ad
vance a cause in which that corpora
tion was not interested. Herrin obeys
the command at those who employ him.
and he is employed by C. P. Hunting
ton.
ROBBED HIS EMPLOYER
OF A SACK OF GOLD
BOLD SAFE BOBBERY IN A
BAKERY.
Andrew Gail Cleverly Relieved of
Three Hundred Dollars by a
Daring Thief.
The police arc puzzled over a mysteri
ous safe robbery which occurred Tuesday
evening in the bakery at 127 Fifth street.
Early in the evening the proprietor, An
drew Gail, weni to the safe and was as
tounded to find it open and the contents,
amounting to $300, gone. As one of his
employes whom he knew as Jack was in
the shop only a short time before, Gail,
suspecting that he had tampered with the
safe, went in search of him. Failing to
find him, he notified the policeman on the
beat.
Last night Gall visited police headquar
tors and reported the robbery to Captain
Bohen. He is strongly convinced that the
mysterious "Jack" opened the safe and
got away with the funds.
"Jack" Is described as being about 40
years old, plainly dressed and wears a

Captain Bohen detailed Detectives Gib

is believed that "Jack" will attempt to

WILL OWN STREET RAILWAYS.
President Plack Talks of Detroit's
Latest Municipal Scheme.
President Albert Plack of the Detroit
Electric Railway Company is a guest at
the Palace Hotel. Naturally Mr. Plack
is deeply interested in the action of the
Detroit Common Council in appointing a
commission to negotiate the purchase of
the. street railway lines of that city. Mr.
Plack is inclined to believe that the ac
tion of the Common Council will hold,
notwithstanding Mayor Maybury'sveo of
the ordinance.
"The ordinance was passed by a vote of
21 to 11. two members of the Council be
ing absent." Bald Mr. Plack last night,
"and I am inclined to think that the Com
mon Council will pass the ordinance over
the Mayor's veto. Municipal ownership
of street railway lines is a pot scheme of
Governor Pingree. who is named as one
of the commissioners, and it was largely
through his influence that the enabling
act was passed by the Legislature at its
HUNTINGTONâ LET HIM 60 FOR A SCAPEGOAT INTO THE WILDERNESS.
recent session. The original bill provided
that the city of Detroit should be au
thorized to build and operate its own lines
and to raise the necessary funds by the
sale of municipal bonds. But as Detroit
is fully equipped in that respect Governor
nd other sensible men realized
that if this plan was carried out the re
sult would moan loss to both the city and
the existing companies. A? a
other bill was substituted and passed au
thorizing the city to appoint a commis
sion to purchase the existing lines. While
wo do not desire to sell we are not fight
ing ?ho plan and will insist only upon re
og a fair price for our property. All
â  car lines in Detroit are owned
mtrolled by the Detroit Citizens'
Street Railway Company, the Detroit
Electric Railway and the Detroit. Fort
Wayne and Belle Isle Railway Company.
They have 200 miles of track In first-class
;tion and splendidly equipped. The
total capitalization of those companies Is
$11,000,000 and their bonded indebtedness
$5.200,000. Under the provisions of the en
abling act the city may issue bonds with
only the street railway property as secur
ity. It cannot pledge the city's credit be
yond that. The purchase price, if the
lines are acquired by the city, probably
will be in the neighborhood of $16,000,000 or
118,000,000."
Mr. Plack says Detroit owns its water
works and lighting plant, both of which
have proved of great benefit to the city.
RELATIONS WITH MEXICO.
George Benham Thinks They Will
Become Very Close.
George A. Benham of Washington, a
lawyer and writer on economic questions,
is spending a few days in the city and
is registered at the Palace. During the
past year he has been traveling through
Mexico, and has made a careful study of
political and economic conditions in all
parts of the republic. In speaking of the
results of his investigations he says:
"The time is coming when Mexico will
be annexed to the United States. This
will be the logical outcome of the course
of events of the past year. The tendency
of the Spanish-American people is to
ward a closer union with the United
States.
"I do not mean to say that Mexico will
bo formally annexed to this country, in
the ordinary sense of the term, but will
come into such relations with us that we
shall acquire a protectorate over the
countryâ much similar to that which
England enjoys over Egypt. Such an al
liance would be of immense benefit to
Mexico, and would give her the advan
tage which a small railway acquires from
an alliance with a larger one. Mexico is
very friendly to this courftry, and has
watched the course of events during the
recent war with the keenest interest. Our
acquisition of Cuba and Porto Rico
means a great deal to Mexico, and will
tend to strengthen her relations with the

AN IMPORTANT
STATE ISSUE
IS OVERLOOKED
Immunity to Wells,
Fargo & Co.
ATTORNEY GENERAL WILL ACT
;
STEPS TO FORCE PAYMENT OF
THE WAR TAX.
The Case Against the Corporation
Has Been Neglected in the
United States Circuit
Court.
Attorney General Tirey L. Ford Intends
to press without delay the charge against
Wells, Fargo & Co. In an effort to force
j that corporation to obey the Federal law
iin reference to war stamps. This com
pany has refused to place war stamps
upon the parcels which it handles. Ex-
Attorney General W. F. Fitzgerald, on
behalf of the State, instituted proceedings
to force Wells, Fargo & Co. to obey the
law. The case was brought before the
Supreme Court, but that tribunal denied
jurisdiction under the circumstances and
referred the matter for consideration to
the Superior Court.
Proceedings were therefore commenced
in the Superior Court, but again juris
diction was lust. <)n this occasion Wells,
Fargo & Co. interfered on their own be
half. They insisted that Federal ques
tions were involved in the controversy
and that the issue should be determined
by a Federal court. The matter was
therefore transferred by agreement to the
United States Circuit Court. Wells,
Fargo & Co. gave a bond ostensibly to
protect the Government in the event that
the case should be decided against the
company.
In this condition the matter has since
rested. Absolutely nothing has been done
and Wells, Fargo & Co. have enjoyed an
immunity from a tax to which other cor
porations and individuals must submit.
When ex-Attorney General Fitzgerald
was superseded in office by Attorney Gen
eral Ford the case was apparently for
gotten. It is a matter of general inter
est to the people of the State, as it ex
hibits an apparently gross discrimination
of the Government in favor of one cor
poration and against all others.
Attorney General Ford says that he
will take up the case as soon as possible.
He understands its importance, but the
manifold duties of his office and the con
fusion incident to the change in State ad
ministration have prevented him from
giving the case the attention it deserves.
The Attorney General has not yet con
sidered the legal aspect of the case and
is not in a position to express an opinion
upon the contention that Federal ques
tions are involved. _____
A singular suit was instituted~by the
Attorney General of Michigan, who won
his point that the State had sole jurisdic
tion in the matter. It Is naturally con
tended that California has the same right.
The point has not been judicially deter
mined in this State, however, and the
Attorney General declares that no fur
ther delay will be tolerated in a case of
such general importance.
AN INCREASED POPULATION.
I A Demand for Greater School Facili
ties in South San Francisco.
The increased population of South San
Francisco during the past five years has
caused the school accommodation in \ that
portion of the city to become over
crowded. jTo have the School Directors
make amends for this is the cause of the
organization of an improvement; club in
the southern portion of this municipality.
The present school building known as
| the JBu.ra<#t Primary. Jkuj twelve clsys^

rooms and is ranked as a primary. To
have the school building enlarged by the
addition of at least six more classes and
also raised to the degree of a grammar
is one of the objects in view by the mem
bers of the improvement club.
The officers of the newly formed club
are: President. Charles Milly; vice pres
ident, Charles Nonnemann Jr.: secretary.
H. C. Mangels; treasurer, A. F. Fitschen;
sergeant-at-arms, Charles Johnson.
These, with quite a number of prominent
residents of the South Side representing
the heads of families and property own
ers, are in the van for improvements.
It is claimed by th<*m that during the
past five years the increase in the popu
lation of the district has been the means
of adding so many children of school
age to the inhabitants that a larger
school building, as also one of a higher
grade, is a necessity in consequence of
the distance from South San Franciscn
to a grammar school. The school at the
Potrero being also a primary one, there
!s no relief nearer than the city high
grade school. As taxpayers and resi
dents of this commonwealth the South
San Francisco people will urge their
claims for recognition.

WRECK OF THE CHILKAT AS SEEN FROM THE DECK OF THE NORTH FORK.
Chilkat Went
Quickly Down
Survivors Tell of the Terri=
ble Catastrophe of the
Humboldt Bar.
THE steam schooner North Fork
arrived from Eureka yesterday
afternoon with six survivors
from the wrecked Chilkat
=5 hoard. The consensus of opin
ion was that "the rollers were too heavy
for the little Chilkat and she went to
pieces before them."
The Chilkat sailed from Eureka for
San Francisco on the 4th inst. with
six passengers and fourteen of a crew |
aboard. The bar was rough, but the
rollers were not as heavy as on many
an occasion when the steamer had
crossed out in safety. At 10:50 a. m.
the Chilkat was in distress and Cap
tain Anderson blew four long blasts on
the whistle to notify the North Fork,
about a quarter of a mile ahead, that
his vessel was in danger. Captain Ba,sh
of the North Fork at once responded,
and bringing his vessel as close to the
wreck as possible lowered two boats.
In the meantime a wave had struck
the Chilkat on the starboard bow and
turned her broadside on. Another roller
broke over her and put her on her
beam ends. Sea after sea struck the
ill-fa.ted rraft and in eight minutes
from the time the danger signal was
blown there was nothing left of the
Chilkat hut "slivers and shingles," as
Captain Bash puts it.
"We sailed from Eureka about 10 a.
m. last Monday," said Captain Bash of
the North Fork yesterday. "We were
about a quarter of a mile ahead of the
Chilkat and as we were making easy
weather of it I never thought the Chil
kat was in any danger. She was fol
lowing us out and seemed to be all
right when I looked back after the
danger signal pounded. I at once slowed
the North Fork down and got her
around, heading for the Chilkat, at the
same time getting my boats ready for
lowering. While doing this I saw the
Chilkat broach to, then her deckhouse
started and she went over on her beam
ends.
"When I got the North Fork as near
as safety would allow I lowered two
boats. First Mate McLennan was in
command of one and Second Mate Lar
sen of the other. McLennan went as
close to the wreck as he dared, but
saw no trace of life. He then rowed
to the only boat that had got away
from the Chilkat and took two men
from it and came back to the ship.
The Chilkat's boat followed our boat
back and we took' the men aboard. A
second boat got away from the wreck,
but a wave struck it and the last I saw
of it it was going end over end in the
roller. Three of the men in it, I be
lieve, got ashore at the life saving
station.
"Two minutes after the Chilkat
broached to her deckhouse went. Then
as the North Fork rose on the crest of
a wave I saw a wave strike the un
fortunate vessel, and when the wave
passed all there was to be seen was
slivers and shingles. Had the boat that
turned end over end been fifty feet
further away it would have rode out
the danger and our crew would have
saved them. But what was to be
happened and the boat was lost.
"By this time the lifeboat with the
life saving crew and the tug Printer
were on the scene so I got ready to
start on my voyage again. The life
boat came alongside and I gave the
captain a list of the men we had saved
and then I stood on my course. The
men I brought down from the wreck
are: Chief Engineer William Pack
wood, Assistant Engineer Clyde Light
ner, Fireman William Griep, Steward
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
T. C. Bohall and Howard Smith, a pas
senger. Not one of them is anything
the worse for his terrible experience."
Chief Engineer Packwood was in the
engine-room when the Chilkat went
over, on her beam ends. "My escape
was a marvelous one," said he. "I was
attending to the engines with my hand
on the lever when I heard the four
whistles blow. I had not the faintest
idea what was the matter and got no
signal from the pilot-house, so the en
gines were still turning over at full
speed when I was washed out of the
engine-room.
"When the Chilkat went over on her
beam ends I was caught like a rat in
a trap. Bundles of shingles were
washed into the room and one of these
I grasped hold of. When the third
roller struck the steamer the deckhouse
opened up from the hull and I floated
out into the ocean on my bundle of
shingles. I was barely clear of the
vessel when the opening closed up
again like a trap, but thank God, I was
clear. The boys in the ship's boat saw
me-come out of the hull and picked me
up more dead than alive."
"When the Chilkat went over on her
beam ends if anybody had offered me
10 rents for my life I would have said
'pass over the 10 cents,' " was the way
Fireman William Griep spoke of his
narrow escape. "The steamer was
thrown over to port and I went over
with her. I thought my last hour had
come and can remember nothing more
until I was sitting in the ship's boat
â¢with the other boys."
T. C. Bohall. the steward, was nn the
bridge with Captain Anderson when the
Chilkat broached to. He says the wheel
was not disabled, but refuses to state
what caused the disaster save that "the
waves were ton heavy for the Chilkat
and she went down before th^m."
"Captain Anderson was not trying to
take a short cut across the end of the
south jetty," said Bohall. "We were
very nearly in the wake of the North
Fork, but making much heavier
weather of it than that vessel. A big
roller broke aboard and it " passed
through my mind that it was the be
ginning of the end. I knew that How
ard Smith, one of the passengers, was
in his stateroom and the door fastened,
so I hurried aft to let him out. When
I reached his room he had got a life
belt on and was crawling out through
the window. By this time the Chilkat
was heeled right over and her upper
deck was within three feet of the water,
while the port boat was floating. Wil
liam Black, one of the sailors, was
standing and he and Smith and I got
into the boat. Clyde Lightner, the as
sistant engineer came along a moment
later and he got in also. Then we cut
the falls and pushed away from the
sinking ship. Griep, the fireman, came
up alongside of us and a few seconds
later the deckhouse lifted up from the
hull and Chief Engineer Packwood
floated out on a bundle of shingles.
Just as he floated clear the hole closed
up again, just, for all the world as
though a door had been opened to let
a man out and closed to after him. It
was the most wonderful escape I have
ever heard of.
"Once clear of the wreck wo stood
out over the bar. One of the North
Fork's boats came along and as ours
was overloaded Griep and Smith got
into it. Both boats then made their
way out over the bar to the North Fork
and mighty glad we were to get aboard
her. The last I saw of Captain Ander
son he was standing on the top of the2
house iwatching to see if anybody
wanted assistance. The mate and two
passengers were standing by a boat
and I suppose the captain's Intention
was to get into it. However, about
two minutes later the Chilkat was
broken into kindling wood and I sup
pose the captain was killed in the
wreckage.
"Second Mate Charles Clyde and
three sailors were down in the hold
looking after the cargo. You see, pome
of the stuff was liable to shift in the
heavy seaway and if not attended to at
once the vessel would take a list that
would instantly prove fatal. While
these men were nobly attending to
their duty the Chilkat turned over, and
I suppose they lost their lives among
the shingles.
"I had been four months on the Chil
kat when she started on her last trip.
I did not like the Humboldt bar and
never stayed below when we were
crossing it. Night or day. rain or shine.
I was always either on the upper d'^ck
or on the bridge when we were passing
in or out. I knew every time we crossed
the bar we were taking chances, but
yi">u bet I was taking as few as possible.
The whole thing happened in eight min
utes. From the time the first roller
struck her until she was strewn In
kindling wood on the bar the second
hand had only time to travel eight
times around its dial, so you can im
agine how quickly the whole thing hap
pened. At eight minutes to 11 last
Tuesday morning there was probably
not a person aboard, outside of myself,
who had a thought of- danger, let alone
death, and yet at 11 o'clock a. m. eleven
of them had passed to the bourne from
which no traveler returneth. It was an
awful catastrophe and came with awful
suddenness.'
Howard Smith, nnp of the passengers.
was in his stateroom lying down when

the Chilkat began to go down. "The
steamer was rolling at a great rate,"
Bald he, "but I paid no attention to that
as It is a customary thing on the Hiim
boldt bar. When a big sea came along
and flooded my cabin I thought it was
time to get out, however, so I put on a
life-belt and made for my door. It was
fastened, so I turned to the window.
The steamer was then almost lying on
her side, so I had no difficulty in getting
out. Then I found Steward Bohall and
together we got into the boat. The
next time I go to Eureka I will go by
train and stage. No more Humboldt
bar in mine."
It was Assistant Engineer Clyde
Lightner's watch off. bo he was in his
room uhfn the shir began to go down.
Seaman Black wap also on duty around
the deck and neither of them had any
difficulty in getting into the port boat
as she lay alongside. As they pulled
for the open sea, however, and saw the
peas rising up like mountains,
neither of them thought his life was
worth an hour's purchase. One mo
ment they were tossed away up toward
heaven on the crest of a mighty billow
and the next instant, like an arrow
from a bow. they would shoot down
into the depths. It was a perilous
time and a fitting conclusion to the
dangers escaped.
The rescued men cannot speak too
highly of Captain Bash and the crew
of the North Fork. Everything possi
ble was done for them and ten minutes
after they pot aboard dry clothing of
some sort was provided for each one.
As the North Fork came alongside Mis
sion-street wharf there was an anxious
crowd awaitinp: her. Friends and rela
tives wore there and some of them
broke down when their last hope was
gone. Captain Anderson's sister-in-law
was among the number. His widow
was at home prostrated by the news
that her husband was among the miss
ing. When the sister learned that Cap
tain Anderson was undoubtedly
drowned she fainted away and had to
be carried "to a hack and sent home. A
few minutes later the survivors of the
Chilkat disaster started for the agenfs
office on California street to dra^ some
of their pay and the crowd that had
assembled to see them land drifted
away in search of another sensation.
NO MORE BODIES
YET RECOVERED
EUREKA, April s.â No bodies haye
yet been recovered from the Chilkat.
In the opinion of the life-saving crew
it is doubtful If they will ever come
ashore. The beach is still covered with
wreckage and valuable pieces of cargo:
The cargo, which was one of the lar
gest and most valuable yet taken from
this bay by her, is practically a total
loss. It consisted of 435,000 shingles,
8660 -feet of lumber, 106 boxes of butter,
M cases condensed milk, 60 cases con
densed cream, 20 boxes apples. 8 sacks
tallow, 40 bundles hides and 2 bundles
furs, besides a quantity of mis
cellaneous freight. Considerable of
the butter and some of the condensed
mik and cream has already come
ashore, but the greater part of it has
been carried off by the salvers. The
butter, it is understood, was shipped
principally by the Riverside creameries,
while the milk and cream came from
the factory at Loleta. The shingles
were shipped from the Baird mill.
The wreck now lies about a mile
north of North Jetty at tow tide. This
morning it was high and dry. Ap
parently all the steamers upper works
had been carried away, and nothing
now remains but her original low hull
turned bottomside up, and out of which
it is believed the machinery has
dropped. Still there is a possibility
that there may be a body or two be
neath these planks, and to-morrow it is
the intention of the life-savers to cut
a hole in the bottom of the hull and
make an exploration of its interior.
Public sentiment here is strong that
the Government, should award medals
to Miss Lillian Shumway. Mrs. Captain
Hennig and Mrs. McLean, who, with
Rev. P. E. Peterson, rescued the three
men on the beach. Medals should be
awarded to these three women, who at
the risk of their own lives rushed into
the breakers and dragged three men
from the very jaws of death.
The Standard says to-night edi
torially :
If pome criminal negligence is not
chargeable to the officers whose duty
it â was to inspect the Chilkat and see
that she had proper boats, life pre
servers and other appliances for sav
ing life in case <>f shipwreck, then we
are badly misinformed. The life pre
b< rvers which came ashore were
water-logged and one of them was a
good load for a man to lift. Instead
of cork, the manufacturer had used
tules, which absorbed water and soon
became absolutely worthless in the
water. "Who inspected these life pre
servers an i placed the Government
apprrval upon them? Such appliances
are worse than none, and it should
be considered criminal negligence en
the part of Government officials whose
duty it is to protect life and property
on the seas, as far as possible, by
feeing that such equipments are relia
ble, to phs<s them and allow nv:i to
perish with one of these sodden loads
around his body. Some one should
answer to the Government for this
criminal negligence, to call it no
worse.

CHINESE GAMBLING FINES.
The Police Judges Meet but Fail to !
Agree Upon a Uniform Course.
In view of the confusion as to fines im- i
posed upon Chinese gamblers a meeting !
of the. Police Judges was held yesterday :
morning to discuss whether it would not !
be advisable to agree upon a definite i
course of action so that the fines would
be uniform. The matter was discussed :
pro and con, but no agreement was
reached and each Judge will Inflict tines ]
according to his own judgment.
It was pointed out at the meeting that i
the evidence, particularly in the fantan i
cases, was. as a rule, altogether lacking, i
and in that case it was belter to impose
a fine of $5 or $10, which would go into
the city treasury, rather than impose a
heavy fine and have the case appealed
and the judgment set aside by the Su
perior Court, a? has been the result in
numerous instances.
As it was believed that the Judges
would hold office only for thiF year, the
term of the presiding Judge was reduced
to three months so that each would have
the honor, and Judge Graham will be the
presiding Judge for the next three
months.

SEA LIONS TO
BE DESTROYED
BY OFFICIALS
Vast Herds Injure the
Fish Trade.
ROOKERIES TO BE RAIDED
GAME COMMISSIONERS BELIEVE
IT IS NECESSARY.
The Views of Commercially Interest
ed Parties Will Be Obtained at
a Special Meeting to Be
Held Soon.
The State Board of Fish and Game
Commissioners are seriously contemplat
ing a raid upon the great herds of sea
Hone along the coast for the purpose of
reducing the number. This subject was
liberally discussed at the meeting of the
board yesterday and the sentiment was
that these animals are getting- too numer
ous for the good of the fishing industry
of the coast. Secretary Babcock called
attention to the vast number of sea lions
scattered the entire length of the coast
and their destructive habits. From what
he can learn an able-bodied se/i lion de
stroys from 100 to 200 pounds of salmon
every day during the run of these fish
to the spawning grounds. When the num
bers of these beasts are taken into con
sideration the loss of fish must be greater
than all that is taken for the canneries
and consumed in the State.
Commissioner Vogelsang stated that the
sea lion has no commercial value and
consequently has been permitted to mul
tiply until the numbers are so great at
all of the rookeries that the time has
come for the commission to take some ac
tion. The average weight of these ani
mals is about 1500 pounds, but there are
not a few of the old males that will turn
the scales at two tons. Reports from the
pilots and captains of coasting vessels
show that the shores north and south of
here and at the Farallones are alive with
the useless creatures. When the salmon,
whirh the State and nation are propa
gating at great expense at the several
hatcheries on the coast, start to run to
the spawning grounds the sea lions hast
en to the bays and rivers in large num
bers and many big fellows have been
keen as far up as Sacramento destroying
tho spawn-laden fish. The fishermen of
the bay and rivers have good cause to
complain. One of the creatures will kill
every fish in the nets in less than five
minutes and every year they destroy
hundreds of dollars' worth of^valuable
nets.
When the run is on tho pea lion does
not eat all of the fish he kills, his favorite
amusement being to kill by biting a
piece out of each fish and leaving the re
mainder for the seagulls.
Commissioner Gould emphasized the
that if the destruction of these ani
mals Is decided upon none must be
touched near tho seal rocks, as the law
protects these. In order to secure a gen
eral opinion it was decided to call a spe
cial meeting: in the near future, to which
will be invited all interested in the matter
of the destruction or preservation of the
useless sea lion. Nearly all of the promi
nent fish packers and fishermen, as well
as the professors at the colleges, will be
asked to bo present and give their views
of the proposition to- reduce the herds
within fifty miles of this city, barring
at the Cliff. It is conceded that all
commercially interested -will turn their
thumbs to the ground on the proposition
and pass the sentence of death upon the
creatures that destroy such vast quanti
ties of food fish.
LABORS OF THE GRAND
LODGE OF WORKMEN
IMPOETANT LAW AFFECTING
SUSPENDED MEMBERS.
Considerable business was transacted at
yesterday's t-ession of the Grand Lodge
of the Ancient Order of United Work
men.
There was the adoption of an amend
ment offered by J. T. Kidd of Eureka Val
ley Lodge, which enables suspended mem
bers to be reinstated after physical exami
nation on payment of only one assessment
in arrears and the pending assessment at
the time of readmission; one to pension
members who have attained the age of
70 years was defeated; one authorizing
lodges to meet but once a month If so de
sired was defeated; two referring to the
duties of financiers notifying the grand
recorders of members who have not paid
on the last day of grace was rejected, as
the matter is already fully covered; one
on the subject of reapportionlng the num
ber of representatives to the Grand Lodge
was defeated; one to levy more than one
assessment at a time, but not to exceed
twelve in a year, with a view to accel
erate payments to beneficiaries, was re
jected; and one relative to reinstatements
after final suspension, offered by R. D.
bfapleden of Fort Jones Lodge, was not
accepted, as the same idea was covered
by tin> Kidd amendment.
The recommendation of the finance com
mittee that the report of the grand re
i order from pages 42 to 52, and that of the
grand receiver, be adopted was carried.
The action of the grand master in de
ciding against the appeal of M. Mauer
ham of Occidental Lodge in the matter of
sick benefits, and of Robert Calvert
against Mount Hamilton Lodge in the
matter of obtaining a withdrawal card
upon surrender of his beneficiary certifi
cate, were sustained.
The appeals of J. R. Fishbeck against
Harmony Lodge and Henry W. Leonard
against Weaver Lodge were referred back
to the lodges, as the papers were not in
proper form. The case of Butler of Sac
ramento Lodge was referred to the com
mittee on arbitration.
The committee's report on honored dead,
with a eulogy of the services of the late
Past Grand Master Brewer, was adopted
by a rising vote.

After an animated meeting which lasted
over three hours the Police Commission-
era last evening practically exculpated
Sergeant Price and his squad of corrup
tion in Chinatown.
For some time past rumors of Chinese
gamblers being compelled to pay tribute
to the police in order to continue running
their games have been circulated for the
purpose of injuring Sergeant Price, so it
was claimed. The whispered mutter
ings of corruption reached the ears of the
Police Commissioners, who ordered Chief
10N MACLAREN Holds a Levee at the Palace Hotel.
Lees to make an investigation. Yester
day he notified President Tobin that he
was ready to report and a meeting was
called for last night. After the routine
business had been transacted Commis
sioner Gunst. whose antipathy for Price
dates back to over a year ago when he
arrested one of Gunst's friends for ob
structing the street, arose and referred
to the rumors of a "sack" in Chinatown.
"If Price and his men have accepted
money from the Chinese gamblers," he
remarked with an apparent show of in
dignation, "I'm In favor of dismissing
them from tho forco. Rumors of corrup
tion among the squad in Chinatown have
been current, and it behooves us to make
a thorough investigation."
Gunst then had the clerk cf the board
read several communications from Chi
nese gamblers in which the -writers de
clared that money was being used to al
low certain games to run.
Chief Lees defended the course of Price
and declared that the Chinese were anx
ious to get rid of him because he was
Inexorable in his prosecution of the law
against lottery and fan-tan. Commission
ers TobLn and Alvord, after listening to
the reports which were read by the Chief
and which were not given to the press?,
after a consultation with Commissioner
Gunst, ordered the head of the Police De
partment to further continue his investi
gation and report to them at the next
meeting.
During th.c so-called investigation,
which was held with closed doors, Ser
geant Price and his squad remained in
the corridor contiguous to the meeting
room of the Commissioners, anxiously
awaiting the verdict. Price seemed to
think that he was to be sacrificed for no
other reason than that he was in the
way of Lieutenant Esola, Who is anxious,
he says, of having him relieved of duty
in Chinatown.
"This is a diabolical scheme to get rid of
me.." he. said. "Esola. anxious to run
Chinatown to suit himself, has conceived
the bold plan of accusing me of accepting
money from the gamblers in order to
carry out his purpose. I am no pinhead
policeman, ana I defy even my superiors
to pay that I am not thoroughly acquaint
ed with police duty. It is different with
Esola, whose ambition iB to be Chief of
Police.
"He poses as an officer far above the
rank and file of the department. There
is one thing n> lacks, however, which is
patent to every man in the depeartment,
and that i 6 brains. Always anxious to
throw dirt on me, he waits until myself
and men are out of Chinatown, and, sum
moning his officers, he picks out an easy
game and with a great flourish of trum
pets raids it. Only recently he raided a
fan-tan game and failing to get the nec
essary evidence he sent for an expert,
who opened the safe. In it he found
about $4000. which he booked as evidence
against the unfortunate Chinese who
were present. The principal gamblers of
Chinatown unhesitatingly declare that
at a recent raid Esola was supplied with
beans, such as are used in playing fan
tan, and being unable to obtain any evi
dence against the gamblers he substi
tuted the beans and arrested the gang.
He had the audacity to book the beans
he had taken into the place as evidence
against the Imprisoned CTilnese. I don't
want to tell too much, but if he drives
me too hard I will tell all I know. My
report, which is in the hanfls of the Chief
of Police, clearly proves that I am inno
cent of the charge of corruption.
"I do not propose to have- my honesty
impeached by such a man as Esola, and
I demand a thorough investigation. My
men were present ready to testify, but
for some reason the Commissioners did
not conclude to call them. This matter,
as far as I am concerned, will be thor
oughly sifted, and at the conclusion
Esola will be shown in his true colors. He
has injured me enough. He must quit."
When Price was told of the verdict of
the Commissioners he was warmly con
gratulated by his fellow officers in whom
he is held in high esteem.

DRUMTOCHTY TALES PLEASED
THE AUDIENCE.
The Celebrated Scotch Writer-Divine
Presented by President David
Starr Jordan of Stan
ford.
The Rev. James Watson, better known
this side of the Kirkyard as lan
Maclaren, made his initial bow last night
at the California Theater to a San Fran
cisco audience. In some respects he is
disappointing, but invariably pleasantly.
In others he far exceeded the expecta
tions of his hearers, who, sad to say,
were fewer than the man and the occa
sion warranted.
The annalist of Drumtochty would never
be taken for a preacher. He has that cut
of the jib and some of that spread of
Bide whiskers so intimately connected
with Chauncey M. Depew. The smugness
of feature also associated with America's
greatest after-dinner speaker Is notice
able in the make-up of the author-minis
ter. His voice, charming: naturally. Is ab
solutely entrancing when he puts into It
the burr one would expect who has read
his tales of Scots life. It clothes the lan
guage of each character for whom it
speaks with the charm of life. It com
pels tears and forces laughter. It is
easily modulated and never breaks and,
more than all, its possessor did not find
it necessary during the whole course of
the evening, to lubricate it from the
pitcher or water so largely in evidence
in this country with the lecture platform.

listened while he read. For most of the
time it was in a mild state of titillation
at his humor; at intervals it laughed out
right, and then, again, it mentally blew
its nose as the minister did in "The Fight

In the selections chosen last evening Dr.
Watson sought to portray three traits
conspicuous in the Scotch character: Love
of learning, secret romance and regard of
duty. To illustrate these traits he read
"The Lad of Perth" and passages from
the tales dealing with "Dr. MacC'.urV

"There are only two things." he read,

TO ABATE NUISANCES.
The Board of Health held a special
meeting last evening for the purpose of
transacting: accumulated routine busi
ness. - â  â  â  r ' â â ".'.- â  â ;
A number of complaints about the un
sanitary condition of Japanese bath
houses were read. Health Officer O'Brien
stated that it was his intention to close
all such bathhouses which do not comply
with the sanitary plumbing laws of the
Health Department.
A complaint read about the nui
sance created by the existence of a cat
tle corral at N street south and Thir
teenth avenue south brought forth a res
olution by Dr. Fitsgibbon condemning
the property. The resolution was unan
imously adopted.
Dr. Bazet presented a report from Dr.
Kellogg in which it is shown that the
beds at the City and County Hospital are
a culture place for all forms of bacteria.
On motion it was recommended that thft
Board of Supervisors be petitioned to
build a sterilizer for the purpose of dis
infecting the beds in a proper manner.
Health Officer O'Brien suggested that
some provision should be made by quar
antine fumigation to prevent the sprc-ad
of cerebro spinal meningitis. He said
the number of death's from this disease
had increased from four in October to
fifteen in February.THE CHARLESTON

mercifully and said that, owing to the
criminal unreadiness of the forces after
the fall of Iloilo, it was impossible to
overawe the rebels, and, because of sev
eral flagrant breaches of faith, impos
sible to conciliate them. Murray said:
"General Miller gave all the Consuls
in the city warning that unless Iloilo
were given up within a certain time
he would bombard. Twenty-four hours
before the given time he opened fire,
not giving the foreign residents time
to take care of themselves. This
breach of faith on the American gen
eral's part turned foreign residents
against the army and undoubtedly pro
longed the war.
"The American forces, I know from
personal observation, are terribly mis
managed, but this is partly, due to the
slow arrival of Instructions from Wash
ington. The rebels are wretchedly
armed, and with prompt action on the
part of the American generals could
long ago have been subdued. Now the
war will last at least another year, and
it will require at least 50,000 more
troops to conquer the rebels.
"I heard definitely just before I took
the steamer at Manila that General
Otis was to be recalled. The reason for
his recall I could not learn, but I heard
from one of the officers that he would
shortly return home.
"The stories that the Americans
slaughtered women and children are all
rot.
"With forty-nine other foreigners. I
undertook to advise General Miller be
fore the fight at Iloilo. Had he not
broken faith, there would have been
no bloodshed. I am thoroughly con
vinced that if the American troops had
been landed immediately after the de
struction of the Spanish fleet there
would have been no land battle. I have
interviewed most of the rebel leaders
and know they are determined, able
men, fighting hopelessly. Aguinaldo is
a weakling and not a true leader. He
leans more to surrender than any of
his men. Montenegre is the born leader
and the general that is the true leader,
and he aione is repsonsible for the con
tinuance of the rebellion.
"The foreign powers will be heard
from if the war lasts much longer. Ow
ing to General Miller's action they are
very antagonistic. In the northern part
of the islands business is ruined and
many of the foreigners are desperate
over their losses."

TACOMA, April s.â The sailor question

which sailed immediately for Honolulu.
One of them jumped overboard and es

Three men are alleged to have been

BRUSSELS. April 5.â Fresh details
have been received regarding the Bel
gian south pole expedition. The expe
dition when sto^ned by the ice near
Alexanderland had traveled to 71 de
grees 36 minutes, and discovered new
lands, seas and many volcanoes.
One officer, Lieutenant Danco, who
had charge of the magnetic observa
tions, died in June.
Some months earlier the expedition
lost a young Norwegian, Wincke, an
excellent draughtsman, who illustrated
the expedition. The members suffered
much from cold in Stepember, when
the minimum was 43 degrees below
zero.
De Gerlache did not state whether he
intends returning toward the south
pole or coming back to Europe. Doubt
is thrown on the matter by the fact
that he wires his correspondence will
be sent from Punta Arenas.
MONTEVIDEO, April s.â The cap
tain of the German steamer Karnock
brought a voluminous report from
Lieutenant de Gerlache, chief of the
Belgian Antarctic expedition, to the
Belgian Consul here, and various dis
patches. The Belgica expedition gath
ered many various collections. The ex

three months and then return to the
Antarctic regions.
FORMAL INVITATIONS TO
THE PEACE CONFERENCE
They "Will Be Issued To-Day Through
Various Ministers, but Bulgaria
Is Slighted.
NEW YORK, April 5.â A special cable
to the Sun from The Hague says: For
mal invitations to attend the peace
conference will be issued to-morrow
through the Ministers to the Nether
lands of Great Britain, Russia, Ger
many. Austria, France, Italy, Turkey,
Spain, Portugal, Sweden, Denmark,
Belgium, Luxemburg, Servia, Rou
mania, Montenegro, Greece, Switzer
land, United States, Siam, Persia,
China and Japan. Tbe note of invita
tion remarks that only questions speci
fied in the second Russian circular
will be discussed. All national political
questions will be rigorously excluded.
Bulgaria's dignity has been wounded
by her omission from the list of nations
invited to attend the peace conference
at The Hague, which includes other
Balkan States. She ascribes her omis
sion to the ill-will of the Porte, which
she believes has Influenced Russia
against her. There Is reason to be
lieve, however, that Bulgaria will
eventually be invited to take part in
the conference, though it may depend
on her behavior during the next few
weeks in connection with the threat
ened Macedonian troubles.
POOLING THE BUSINESS
OF LIGHTING COMPANIES
Three Los Angeles Corporations May
Soon Arrive at an Under

LOS ANGELES, April B.â lt is stated
in commercial rirck j s thc-it the recent at-
tempts to pool the business of the Los
Angeles lighting Company, the San
Gabriel Company anil the Kdison Com
pany, by which they were to district the
city and regulate prices, is still, under
conside ration. 'While those Interested in
the corporation deny to-night that the
combination has not fully matf rlalizcd
owing to a disagreement among the prin
cipals as to details, still the departure
of President Barker of the Edison Com
pany for the Bast to-morrow gives color
to the statement that the trifles which
have been seeming obstacles may be re
moved by the time he returns.
In connection with this possible pooling
of Interests the astounding discovery has
been made thai the time in which the
terms of the conduit ordinance should be
obeyed has been by manipulation extend
er from last December until July 3. The
last extension asked for was only for
three months, which would expire yester
day. It has heen discovered that the or
dinance grants an extension of three
months from April 3. No one at the City
Hall is able to explain how this deferred
date crept into the ordinance. The Edi
son Company is the only corporation that
has not conduits all underground.
PORTUGUESE FOR
HAWAIIAN PLANTATIONS
Secret Movement Afoot to Import
Thousands of Contract
Laborers.
TACOMA, April s.â Private advices
received to-day from Honolulu state a
secret movement is under way in Ha
waii to flood the islands with Portu
guese laborers from the Azores Islands.
There will be from 6000 to 10.000 Im
ported as soon as arrangements can
be completed, unless the plan is fore
stalled. They will probably be brought
by Italian warships by way of Cape
Horn, but it is possible they will come
overland by way of Tacoma. if ships
can be found to carry them.
This enterprise is the result of the
approach of exclusion of Japanese by
the United States contract labor laws.
Secrecy has beon preserved to prevent
opposition on the ground that it is a
scheme to evade contract labor laws.
Thte Portuguese probably will be im
ported as free immigrants.

SUCCESSFUL IN
COMMUNICATING
WITHOUT WIRES
Officers of tfye Signal Corps Will
Flasl} .Messages From Wash
ington to Fort .AVeyep.
NEW YORK, April 5.â A Washing
ton special to the Herald says: It is
the confident expectation of the officers
of the signal corps of the army that
within a short time messages can be
flashed to and from the War Depart
ment to Fort Myer, five miles away,
without the aid of wires.
Important experiments already made
at Fort Myer by Colonel James Allen,
now acting chief of the signal corps,
and Lieutenant George O. Squire, have
demonstrated that it is practicable to
transmit messages by means of elec
tric waves produced in the manner em
ployed by Marconi. These officers have
found that at a distance of 1000 yards I
they can telegTaph any message, and i
it is intended to increase the distance j
gradually until the War Department |
and Fort Myer are connected.
Lieutenant Squire told me to-day
that he was much gratified at the re
sults of the experiments,- and he be
lieves that when the experiemntal
stage has been passed the system will
be of much value for working between
the shore and lighthouses, communi
cating between vessels at sea and for I
marine work generally.
Perhaps the most important demon
stration so far made has been the im
possibility of exploding a magazine on
board a modern ship by means of the
electric waves. Lieutenant Squire said
that in the first place it would be neces
sary to have an operator on board the
ship to be destroyed, and even then it
would be impossible to transmit a wave
through iron. The placing of the in
strument in an iron cage will prevent
waves from reaching their destination
and a zinc screen also stops them. On
account of the length of the waves
their energies are absorbed differently
by different substances. Thus water
and metal absorb all their energy;
TRAIN THE GIRLS
IN HOUSEKEEPING
Mrs. Weymouth's Advice
to Mothers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, April s.â The second
day's session of the Woman's Parlia
ment of Southern California opened
this morning with an increased attend
ance, and at each meeting to-day the
auditorium of the Universalist church
was crowded with people â mostly wo
men, of course, though there was a
generous sprinkling of men. The pul
pit was freshly decorated with poppies,
roses and palms. The ladies sensibly
removed their hats and late comers
were kept in the vestibule while papers
were being read.
The first paper of to-day's session
was by Mrs. A. B. Weymouth of
Orange, who took for her subject
"Housekeeping as a Profession fo*
Girls." Mrs. Weymouth contended that
more attention should be paid to th 2
training of young girls in the duties
incidental to keeping house, not neces
sarily for other people, but for them
selves. She said it was evident girls
nowadays were allowed to neglect this
important branch of education. In thÂ«
discussion that followed Mrs. Ella L.
Sessions of Hueneme spoke in line with
the author of the paper and coincided
with most of her deductions.
Mrs. Sessions of Hueneme and Mrs.
Hughes of lowa led the discussion,
bringing out the point that girls were
unwilling to engage in housework out
side of their own homes because they
felt they would not be respected in such
positions and because they had less lib
erty than in other lines of work.
Dr. Black of Los Angeles denied thnt
housekeeping required more brains, but
said it required willingness. Dr. Black
criticized woman's tendency to think
lightly of men's work.
A resolution, introduced by Mrs.
Caroline M. Severance of Los Angeles,
was adopted, committing the parlia- ,
ment to the approval of the efforts ,
leading to a perpetual peace, In line
with the action of the women of the
East, who are hoping for the coming
of an era of universal brotherhood.
The resolution commended the coming
convention at The Hague and hoped
that the Czar's disarmament proposi
tion will be accepted by the world, and
that there would be no more war.
The afternoon programme included a
paper on "Child Study for Women
Clubs," by Miss Virginia Pease of Na
tional City. There was a spirited ad
dress on "The Municipality and the In
dividual," by Mrs. Lou V. Chapin, in
which she took the position that so.
cialism meant not liberty, but despot
ism; that municipal ownership of utili
ties in this country was dangerous, for
the reason that City Councilmen now
grow rich in unsalaried positions. Mrs.
Mary Darling read a paper on ' Oppor
tunities for the Middle Aged Woman,"
after which -the members of the parlia
ment were taken for a drive by the
Board of Trade.
This evening a reception was held for
the members of Women's Fraternal So
cieties, only members of secret socie
ties being admitted. This closed one
of the most successful sessions of the
Woman's Parliament yet held in South
ern California.

Widow.
SEATTLE, April s.â Rachael T. Hemp
son, a wealthy widow, has begun suit
her,e against T. R. Jameson to recover '
JCOOO which she says she loaned him on his
promise to marry her. In her ccfrnplaint
she alleges that she met the defendant
in San Francisco in November, 1597, and
they became good friends. Jameson was
very attentive to her and called at her
home at least once a week. After a num
ber of months he proposed marriage and
was accepted. The wedding day was set
and the plaintiff began preparing for the
event.
Shortly after the engagement, she says,
Jameson came to her and represented
that ho needed money to continue his
business. He said he was a manufacturer
of surgical instruments. The confiding
widow l<'t him have JtJOOO, and she has not
seen him since. She has learned, how
ever, that he was the owner of a number
of lots near Lake I'nion, in this city, and
for this reason she brings the suit here.

FORT WORTH, Texas, April s.â Dr.
Charles V. Harris of the Medical De
partment, U. S. A., passed through here
to-day en route to Washington on im
portant business with the department.
He comes from the Philippine Islands
and says the reports of the excellent
health of the American troops are
false. Dr. Harris stated that many
United States soldiers, disheartened
over their physical condition, deliber
ately place themselves as a target for
the enemy's guns. It Is the opinion of
Dr. Harris that if the American troops
remain In the Philippines any great
length of time sickness and death is
sure to follow.
Ends Life With Poison.
PORT ANGELES, 'April Thomas
Andre, a resident of this place for the

house to-day. All indications point to sui

of the Southern Pacific in Southern Cali

eyes for some time, and this is thought
to have led to his suicide.
CENTRAL PACIFIC WILL
CONVEY THE SOLDIERS
LOS ANGELES. April s.â The quarter
master's department of the United States
army will in a few days open bids for the
transportation of 5000 officers and men to
San Francisco, there to take ship for the
Philippine Islands to take the place of
volunteers near Manila. Santa Fe will
not bid for this transportation. It looks
like an exceptionally fat contract, but in
reality carries little or no money, and
only a land-grant road is able to do the
hauling. When bids for thf> taking of the
First New York were asked a short time
apo the Santa Fe made a bid to carry
that regiment East. The contract was
given to the Central Pacific and its con
nections. The Santa Fe people here say
they do not care to carry passengrs at
the figures allowed, as the Government
demands that the soldiers be carried in
battalions in special trains.
Thousands of soldiers will be hauled to
and from San Francisco before the
trouble in the Philippine Islands is ended,
and as soon as the Government lien on
the Central Pacific has been lifted and
that line become a part of the Southern
Pacific the* cinch will be removed and
competition will bring other lines Into the
fray.

AWFUL RESULT OF
MENTAL STRAIN
A Man From Utah Tells
of His Sufferings and
Rescue.
WORRY AND OVERWORK REDUCE
HIM TO A COMPLETE PHYSI- 1
CAL WRECK.
The following remarkable story cornea
from Mr. J. T. Ward of Park City,
Utah. He says: For several years I
was broken down In health, my nerv-
ous system was a complete wreck,
as were also my digestive organs. I
could not sleep, could not eat, and
was greatly reduced in flesh. I would
shake like a leaf at times. Could not
think well nor apply myself to business.
After trying many remedies without re-
sult I learned of Hudyan. I began tak-
ing it, and soon found that I was gain-
ing in strength and had a better appe-
tite. One symptom after another began
to leave me, end to-day I find that I am
completely cured. Hudyan is a good med-
icine and in my opinion no remedy can
take the place of it in the treatment of
nervous and stomach disorders.
Persons who are afflicted with head-
ache, dizzy spells, poor memory, nervous-
ness, sleeplessness, irritable . tempers,
etc., are usually suffering from worn-out
nervous system. Stomach disorder is very
often a complication. Hudyan is an in-
fallible remedy in such cases. If the tis-
sues are used up faster than nature can
repair them it is then that the preans
must suffer. It is then you have rheum-
atism, neuralgia, heart trouble, nervous
dyspepsia and other ills. Hudyan being
a great blood and tissue builder, it will
cure â  such complaints. Since Huydan
reaches every nerve and fiber in the hu-
man organism it is well adapted for the
cure of all chronic cr ."mplaints. . The great'
and good work that , Hudyan is accom-
plishing in the treatment of all stomach,
liver, kidney, nervous and blood diseases
proves that it Is nature's own remedy.
! It is wonderful how many persons (sup-
posed to have been suffering from incur-
able diseases) that Hudyan has cured.
â  Hudyan will give you strength if you
are weak. It will give you color if you
are pale. It will give. you: flesh if you
are thin. Hudyan is a destroyer of dis-
ease germs, therefore it is a valuable
remedy ' for malaria. Malaria may affect
the stomach, the liver, the tongue- may
be coated, you suffer from headache, loss
of appetite, lassitude, etc Hudyan will
cure. Hudyan is for sale by druggists, or
will be sent direct upon receipt of price â
50c a package, or six packages for $2 50.

AND RAILWAYS.
HZeanwhile the Czar Is Massing
Large Bodies of Troops at Im
portant Points to Boldly
Aid the Grab.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, li. C, April s.âAd
vices from the Far East brought by the
steamship Empress of Japan state that
a correspondent of the North China
Daily News gives some remarkable in
formation regarding tho Russian prog
ress in Manchuria and the northern
provinces. He points out that whereas
the only British subjects who are per
mitted by treaty to own lands outside
treaty limits are missionaries, Russians
in Manchuria are acquiring land as
they please and are already working
mines. The railroad, too, is obviously
a military one. and he asserts that
there are 30,000 Russian troops at Port
Arthur. 3000 at Talien Wan. 2000 at Kin
chou, 200 at Lunchou, 200 at Wa Fang-
Hen, 200 at Nleu-chwang, -00 at Hai
ihie: . Liao-yang, 300 at Kirin,
n, north of Kirin, and,
In fact, B ra are a!;
Manchuria. They are to be met witn
even where the railway will not touch.
In Halchleng the Russians have
taken a shop and fortified it by
mounting guns. At Liao-yang they
have a site 200 yards square, where
they are building barracks, and 300 sol
diers with twenty officers and mining
engineers are quartered there. Outside
the city they are purchasing land and
intend to occupy houses for the sum
mer. The Chinese md people
are much afraid of th>- intruders, who
do Just a? they like and square any re
monstrance with a few dollars.
Visitors to the locality cannot move
without being shadowed by Russians.
As there is no railway at Kirin and the
branch line which lÂ£ 1 will not
reach there for two years, the presence
idiers appears unnecessary. The
Russo-Chinese Bank has opened a
branch in Kirin, worked by Chinese,
with one foreigner, who is British, but
little beyond political work appears to
be done.
At Haipon, -where the railway will
branch off from the main line to Vlad
ivostok, there are Russian settlements
with 20,000 soldiers. It is instructive
to compare this military occupation
with the railway in which British cap
italists are to have their money, a {rood
road with stone embankments and
work Phops along the line, where car
riages bridges are being built and
not yet one British soldier to protect
the property.
The agricultural and mineral re
sources of Manchuria are immense, and
the Russians are working so as tn ex
ploit them for- their sole advantage.
Land is being compulsorily acquired at
the rate of |10 a mow, and in the event
>.f Chinese resistance a telegram to the
Russian Minister at Peking overcomes
it.
EDGAR WOULD BE

PAN QUENTIN PRISON, April 5.-
When Captain of the Yard J. C. Edgar

e-rous duties devolving upon an occupant

put in a request on behalf of the general thut

would testify concerning refrigerator beef and

The one Instance of sickness believed to have

DEATH'S SUMMONS
ENDS A ROAMNCE.
Taleof a Rich Uncle and
Fascinating Niece.
Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, April 5.â A love ro
mance, in which a rich old uncle and a
fascinating niece were the Romeo and
Juliet, ended here this morning in the
death of John P. Conlon at the Grand
Lodging House, corner of Second and
San Fernando streets. Mrs. Abbie
Kinnes- is the bereaved, and Is left
about a half million dollars in New
York properties and securities.
Several years ago John P. Conlon re
tired from the pursuits of business in
New York to enjoy his fortune. He had
no other relatives than Mrs. Kinnes
and a nephew who bore his name. The
latter was a spendthrift and by his wild
career had disgraced his uncle"s name.
About this time Mrs. Kinnes' husband
'lied. She was young and attractive.
She took up her abode with her uncle,
and the mutual relationship soon
turned into love. The rich old uncle
at once legally adopted Mrs. Kinnes.
The law prohibited the marriage of per-
Boni of their degree of relationship,
(onion at once divided his property
with his adopted daughter and fixed
the remainder â¢so his nephew could
never come In for any of it. Mrs.
Kinnes was given everything she
wished and the couple enjoyed them
selves to their hearts' content. Several
trips to Europe and a trip around the
world were made. It is said Mr?.
Kinnes generally passed as Mrs. Col
non.
On January 10 last Conlon and Mrs.
Kinnes left New York for California
by way of Panama, arriving in San
Francisco about a month ago. Flcydes
were procured and they started to make
a tour of the State awheel. San Jose
was reached a week ago. Last Friday
evening, while dining in the Mercan
tile Restaurant, Conlon was stricken
by apoplexy. He was removed to his
apartments and Dr. Frasse summoned.
He rallied for a while, but yesterday
he began to pink and passed away
early this morning. Deceased had suf
fered from Bright's- disease for some
time and the .stroke of apoplexy re
sulted from it. Conlon was a native of
New York and 53 years of age.
It is said Mrs. Kinnes has deeds to
some valuable Now York property that
she wishes to place on record before
the "forgotten" nephew can file any
claim to the estate. Phe starts Eas\
with the remains to-morrow.

report for duty. He had tested a piece of this
meat for salicylic acid, getting a decided re
action. On another occasion he secured a
boraclc acid reaction.
"One peculiarity of the meat." he said, "was
that It kept so well and smelled so badly."
When men would throw It up, often many
hours after eating, It was still found unde
composed. He had considered the canned meat
unfit for his men to eat and had ad-vlsed them
not to eat it.
Dr. Currie expressed the opinion that the re
frigerator beef had been soaked in some pre
servative fluid, containing- salicylic acid, but
he afterward paid his first Idea was that the
acid had been injected.
Dr. Currie said he had discovered some ten
or twelve years ago by actual tests that Swift
& Co. used salicylic' acid to preserve their
meats. Two months ago he had made a test
of beef furnished by Armour & Co. at his own
home .in Englewood. X. J., and had found that
it contained salicylic acid.
Major Lee asked that some men of the rifle
range detail be summoned before the court, but
the court did not respond to the request.
Major Lee then read the' reply of the court to
General Miles' request for the summoning of
131 witnesses named by him and General Miles'
reply asking that they be, placed In the record.
The letter to General Miles was written by
Recorder Davis of the Court of Inquiry. It
was dated yesterday and read as follows:
"I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your
favor of the 3d inst.. inclosing the final list
of witnesses. 1 am directed to say that such
of the persons named, as appear from the
statement submitted, to be In possession of
facts not already covered by the testimony of
witnesses, will be summoned to appear with
the least possibly delay." â  . â  â¢
General Miles' reply said In part?
"It Is my belief that at least 25,000 men.
and undoubtedly a much greater number, would
confirm the testimony that has already been
given that a portion of the food supplied the
army was unwholesome and unsuitable for
use. I therefore request that the small number
of witnesses â 131â whose names have Just been
submitted, may be called upon to give their
testimony before your court."
The general understanding about the court
Is that the request will not be complied with.
Henry Raphael, manager for Armour & Co.,
in New York, who had been called at the In
stance of General Miles to testify, said that
last May he had in stock 140,000 pounds of
canned roast beef. Later in the season he re
ceived more, some coming from Chicago and
some from cities In England. The beef from
abroad had been there from one to two years.
This he had turned over to Colonel Woodruff
on the dock. Asked 4f any of the meat sent
abroad had been rejected there, he said: "I
know positively that none of It' was rejected.
I know this from our firm In Chicago and from
the condition of the beef."
The meat had been returned to fill contracts
â with the Government, some going to the army
and pome to the navy. Altogether about 450,000
pounds had been sold to the army. .
Mr. Raphael said # the Government's purchases
â were always ma' on samples selected gen
erally by himself. These were Inspected, as
was also the beef on -delivery- Only three cans
of.th? entire sale to the army and navy had
been refused, and those had been replaced.
POOL ROOMS TO
BE SUPPRESSED
Marin County's Battle
for Decency.
Special Pispatch to The Call.
SAN "RAFAEL, April s.â The most
perplexing problem that has confront
ed District Attorney Mclsaac since he
has been an incumbent â a legal meth
od to suppress the poolrooms at Sau
salito and thereby save Marln County
from the annual recurrence of scenes
so. repugnant to the residents of a su
burban district â is at last in a fair way
of solution. So confident is Mclsaac
that he has found a plan to circumvent
the action of the Board of Town Trus
tees of Sausalito that he has already
conferred with the Supervisors in re-
gard to the matter, and it is predicted
by those who claim to know the In
clination of the county fathers that
they will give the District Attorney
thetr united support In one more effort
to destroy an evil that has so far
laughed at every attack made upon it
by the county officials.
As Sausalito is an incorporated town
the Supervisors are powerless so far
as adopting an ordinance prohibiting
betting on Eastern races is concerned.
Those citizens of the town not directly
profited by the presence of the pool
rooms have frequently agitated the
proposition to disincorporate, but have
always been foiled by the attitude of
the "water front," where so many
voters reside as practically to control
municipal elections. H. H. Noble car
ried the question into the domain of
the Superior Court by petitioning for
an injunction to restrain the gambling,
on the ground that It . constitutes a
public nuisance. This plan signally
failed, and now another determined ef
fort is to be made.
According to section 25 of the county
government act, a Board of Supervis
ors is empowered to regulate and li
cense all business or traffic in a county
not prohibited by law. Poolroom
gambling comes under this head. It is
further provided that any violation of
An ordinance so regulating and licens
ing a business or traffic constitutes a
misdemeanor and as such is punishable
by law. According to Mclsaac's view
all the board has to do to suppress the
evil is to exact a license of $10,000 a
quarter from the poolroom men. â which
will really amount to a prohibition.
When this section referred to was
called to the attention of the Super
visors and its provisions explained to
them they were much impressed with
the simplicity of the method advocated
by the District Attorney and took the
proposition under consideration at
once. ' It is expected that an ordinance
will be framed and adopted in a short
time.
HEAVY SEAS WASH
OVER THE VESSEL
Little Steamship C. G. Cherry En-
counters a Storm While Sail
ing Northward.
VICTORIA. B. C. April 5.-TJie steamer
C. G. Cherry, a small vessel with a big
American flap: nfher peak and the name
Snn Francisco, her home port, paanted on
the stern in big white letters, put into
this port this morning in distress. Some
thing had gone wrong with her boilers,
:in<l since Monday she had been running
up the straits under the scanty canvas
she carries.
The Cherry left San Francisco last Fri
day, and had a trying voyage up the
coast. On several occasions big seas had
washed right over her. Last Sunday a
big storm was encountered, and it
seemed as though the seas would engulf
the little cannery vessel. On Monday the
holler began to leak, and it was thought
advisable to bank the fires and endeavor
to sail, to Victoria. After some difflculty
this was done, and the damaged boiler
was repaired to-day.
The Cherry expects to continue her
voyage to Chignik Bay, Alaska, to-mor
row morning.

signatory to the Berlin treaty relative j
to the powers to be conferred upon the
commission which will be sent to Apia
it was authoritatively stated to-day l
that no agreement of a satisfactory j
character has yet been reached.
All that has been decided upon is that :
the commission shall be appointed and
shall proceed to Apia to investigate i
the situation there and the entire Sa- j
moan question. It was significantly !
added by a diplomat with whom I j
talked that it was the hope of the gov
ernments concerned that the commis
sion would do more than make an in- j
vestigation and report.
It is the desire of the administration
that an agreement be reached as the ]
result of the organization of the com- j
mission which will prevent any contro- '
versy in future growing out of the |
election of a king or of the administra
tion of affairs on the islands.
No decision has been arrived at by
the President respecting the person
who will be selected to represent this
Government on the commission. No
official of the department has been as
signed to duty, because the depart
ment needs the services of its entire
force.
COMING APPOINTMENTS
BY GOVERNOR GAGE
Plum Tree Will Be Snaken Before the
Executive Returns to the
Nortii.
LOS AJNGELES, April s.â Governor
Henry T. Gage is having a fine time on
his Downey ranch. The Governor will !
not go north until early next week. He â¢
will make public a list of appointments, j
including a successor to Adjutant Gen- j
oral Peeler, a member of the Board of
Equalization in the Southern California
district; a member of the Board of !
Whittier Trustees, three Commission
ers to the Paris Exposition and a
Deputy Labor Commissioner before he
leaves.
The Board of Whittier School Trus
tees soon will be solidly Republican, as
former Sheriff "William R. Rowland will
on Saturday resign.
Rowland has for two years consti- j
tuted, with Mrs. Adina Mitchell, a ma
jority of the board, and now that Gov
ernor Gage is in power and Mrs. Mitch
ell's term has expired, Rowland, not
caring to be in the minority, desires to
step out. Dr. Walter Lindley wiU to
morrow discuss Whittier affairs with
Governor fiae;e.
The selection of a Paris commis
sioner from Southern California lies
between Frank Wiggins, secretary of
the Chamber of Commerce, and Ben C.
Truman, the veteran editor. Truman's
friends are insisting to-day that as
Governor Gage has never affiliated with
the Chamber of Commerce the resolu
tions from the commercial bodies will
have but little effect in influencing his
appointments.

CROOKED WORK
IN PRIMARIES
AT STOCKTON
Fight of Factions in the Repub
lican Party May Lead to
Indictments.
STOCKTON, April s.â To-day's de
velopments have not served to allevi
ate the strained relations between the
factions of the Republican party. In
dictments will in all probability be re
turned within forty-eight hours against
C. T. Eckstrom, Deputy Superintendent
cf Streets, and Charles Patterson, a
prominent young business man. Both
stand high in social and political cir
cles. Their friends are rallying to their
defense in the hope of heading off the
indictments.
On the other hand, the leaders of the
defeated faction in the Third Ward will
press the charges, even though under
the Stratton law they come under the
serious designation of "felony."
Briefly stated, the trouble started in
a personal fight for leadership in the
Third Ward between John Collins and
C. T. Eckstrom. Collins led the anti-
A. P. A. faction, while Eckstrom's
ticket was regarded as the one fav
ored by the A. P. A. Eckstrom failed
of election, but the remainder went
through. The A. P. A. had carried the
heaviest wards at ward meetings the
evening before, and rallying yesterday
in the Third Ward, put up an opposi
tion ticket and on the face of the re
turns won out by a substantial major
ity.
When the election officers came to
count over the ballots to tally them,
they found that there were ten more in
the pile than the lists showed. It was
found that ten ballots had been sur
reptitiously or otherwise inserted, and'
they were declared fraudulent and so
marked by all the officers. They must
either have been laid on the table and
other ballots piled on them or inserted
in the pile after It had been dumped
out. The general opinion seems to be
that it was a piece of foolishness not
equaled in the calendar of fools. That
the ballots could not have been counted
must have appeared to any sane per
son, because it would- have become
known just as soon as the number of
ballots in the box and those on the
officers* list did not tally. Then the
ballots were not prepared for voting,
that is, they did not have the slip con
taining the number torn off.
Dick Garibotto declares that he saw
Patterson handling election stationery
about 6 o'clock, an hour after the polls
closed. Presently, he says, he saw Pat
terson leave the voting place with
something tucked under his coat, and
when outside Eckstrom joined him.
The latter saw Garibotto watching, so
he asked him what he was watching
for, and admonished him to move on.
After crossing the street he saw Pat
terson throw something into a vacant
building and go In after it. Garibotto
returned to the polling place, and a few
minutes later he went back to the Im
perial bar with L. E. Allington. While
there Garibotto asserts he was ap
proached by Eckstrom, who asked him
not to mention the incident he had wit
nessed. Garibotto declined to keep
quiet about it. Alllngton corroborates
his friend as to this.
U. H. Mallory. of the defeated fac
tion, said to-day in an interview:
"Eckstrom and Patterson confessed to
Mr. Clark and myself, and asked for

Special IMspatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, April s.â Among
I the mail advices received by the Em
; press of Japan from the Orient Is the
! following strange story told by the
: Seoul correspondent of the Japan Ad
vertiser:
Outside the west gate of Seoul live
i a number of mutangs or female exor
: cists. Last year five of these women,
| with their "consorts-" and children,
i went north into the provinces on a
i tramp. After two months' working
| through Wanghai they passed into
1 Ham-Kyeng, living on the earnings of
! the women in the villages and hamlets.
| The business of driving out evil spirits
| proved flourishing, and the men taking
! charge of the money accumulated over
i $200 each. This money the men took
! Into the magistracy of Kowon and
! tried to purchase orders on Seoul. The
' thing became known to the local police
! and they seized the men and the serv
! ants with them, ten in. all, charging
! them with being robbers.
Probably this was the first time pri
| vate people had ever ventured into
| Kowon and exhibited such a sum of
â  money. The men, however, refuted the
charge of being robbers, but the entire
! ten were subjected to such torture by
I the constables that one of them died
j the next day, and another one the fol
] lowing day.
The local prefect being absent and a
neighboring official having jurisdiction
the women appealed to him for help.
He ordered the eight men living to be
I removed to his town. He saw they
were in a hopeless situation, and, fear-
Ing to become involved in the unpleas
| antness, he refused to do anything and
; sent the unfortunates back to. Kowon.
Here they were set upon again by their
i captors and so beaten that they became
badly crippled.
Their money was by this time all
gone and when the new magistrate
came to Kowon the matter was so
presented to him that of the remain
ing men seven were executed on the
21st of the seventh moon, and a blind
man left as the only survivor of the
! ten.
About this time the women came
back with their earnings, honing to
release the men. They also were rob
bed and badly abused. They escaped,
1 however, and came to Seoul.
Recently one of the runners from
Kowon was identified in the streets of
Seoul by one of the women and placed
under arrest. He acknowledged the
killing, but throws the blame on the
i constables.
Pastor Hemphill Besigns.
BALLARP, April s.â Rov. Joseph
Hemptiill, brother of Rev. John Hemp
hill of Calvary Presbyterian Church. San
Francisco, who has faithfully served a
pastorate extending over several adverse
seasons, has tendered his resignation to
the churches at Ballard, Los OUvos and
Santa Cruz. The reverend gentleman
who has the respect and good will of his
parishioners, refuses to offer any explan
ation other than that he feels that his
work here is ended.
mercy. I first heard of it throuerh
young Garibotto, whom I met near the
Imperial Hotel. He was so excited he
j could hardly talk. He stated that he
; had seen Eckstrom and Patterson take
i some papers away from the table
where the counting was in progress,
and that they were destroying them
!in a vacant building on the corner. I
! went down there immediately. They
I were tearing up the tickets they had
taken, but when they saw me coming
! they gathered up the fragments."
There are said to be other material
witnesses. The Grand Jury was i.n
session to-day, and just before the
close of the session it is understood a
! number of subpoenas were issued. It
is known positively that District At
torney Ashley is investigating, and
will not pass the matter if the evi
dence already offered is found to be
trustworthy. Developments are ex
pected to-morrow.
The first election under the Stratton
law indicates that it leaves unlimited
openings for contests on technical
points. For instance, in the same ward
where alleged criminal acts took place
the Judges found on opening the ballots
that in a score of instances the printed
I tickets had become detached from the
j ballot and were' under no particular
; party designation. The judges laid
, them out on the ground that it was not
; within their province to say whether
j they had been properly placefl; that
I they had no right to count them even
though the apparent Intent of the voter
was discernible. As these ballots
thrown out did much to lose the ward
to Collins and help the A. P. A. faction
the former prepared to contest. The
carelessness of voters here in not fold
ing their tickets securely indicates how
easy it will be to defeat the evident will
i>f voters under the arbitrary provisions
of the law.
The Democratic vote was light, and
the Republicans charge that the op
posing party mixed freely in their af
fairs, .being protected by the secrecy
i of the ballot and the bringing together
j of all classes at the polls, so that the
; old-fashioned mode of challenging was
I not possible or allowable. Seemingly
I the law allows a general .trade between
I factions in both parties, practically al
j lowing the interloping party to shape
; a delegation to the convention of os
tensible opponents. The tightening of
party lines was not observable either
in the proceedings of the day or the
final results.
The City Council met this evening to
. canvass the returns. There was no op
-1 portunity for contestants to object to
- the returns here as the functions of the
Council gojio further than canvassing
the returns. The contest must lay in
the Superior Court. It seemed novel
to the spectators to see this official
body pass on delegations to a straight
party convention, marking the end of
the good old times when contesting
j delegations won or lost through the
friendliness or opposition of those who
made up the majority of the conven
tion.
There are rumors to-night that if
Eckstrom and Patterson are prosecuted
pome serious charges will be made
against a man who has held a prom
inent State office; because his offense
occurred at a ward meeting he could
not be prosecuted, but the charges
would be very embarrassing.
ITALY WATCHED
BY THE JAPANESE
Jealousy Over Attempt
to Grab San Mun.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, B. C, April 5.-OH
ental advices brought by thi? steamship
Empress of Japan indicate that Japan
has watched with jealous eye Italy's
recent attempt to get possession o f San
Mun.
Marquis Ito has been in direct com
munication with Li Hung Chang and
has advised various reforms. He says
the partition of China will be inevitable
should China persist. in her present
course of action.
In view of the San Mun affair the
Japanese are saying their Government
must abandon the hold-aloof policy
hitherto adopted and demand some sub
stantial grant of land from China,
probably a port in Fokien.
Count Okuma, ex-Premier, advises
the Government to so conduct itself as
to induce China to rely solely upon" the
"gallant" assistance of Japan for the
maintenance of independence. The first
measure to be adopted for that pur
pose is to drill several hundred Chinese
soldiers by Japanese officers, secondly
to encourage the dispatch of Chinese
students to Japan for study. If the
situation should compel Japan to take
a final step it will be absolutely neces
sary for her to hold Amoy and the
railway between that place and Han
kow. This phase can only enter into
Japan's calculations when the mainte
nance of China's integrity is entirely
despaired of and there is* no hope of
preventing a partition. In the mean
time Mr. \ano, the Japanese Minister
at Peking, has applied to the Chinese
Government for five new settlements
for Japan's exclusive use, to be opened
at Foochow, Amoy, inkaw (New
chwang), Shanghai and Chungking,
in addition to the Tientsin and Hankow
settlements, which have been conceded
already. It is stated that the Chinese
Government has decided to entertain
the demands, with the exception of
Shanghai and Chungking.
There appears to have been no truth
in the report that the Dowager Empress
had recalled Li Hung Chaog to Peking
The latter has finished the labor of ex
amining the Yellow River, but his rivals
in the Tsung Li Yamen are trying to
keep him out of the /capital. They fear
his intluence.

eat.
While â¢ examining the ground about
the cabin George Davis, 'â¢ne of the
c, made a discovery that almost
dispelled all doubt that the man who
had so lately occupied the cabin was
Moore. Outside the door Davis picked
up several cigarette stumps, peculiarly
flattened at the m<uith end. These were
identically the same as some i'>und at
Moore's cabin on Little Deer Creek.
Moore is an inveterate cigarette smoker
and his peculiar method of smoking at
tracted the attention of those who
knew him intimately at Nevada City.
Early in his youth the murderer con
tracted the habit of placing his cigar
ette in the center of his Lips, flattening
out the end as a Chinaman does.
All attempts tn trace the murderer's
teps any distance away from the
cabin proved futile. The trail ended
there. The posse separated and formed
. ep circle on the ridge about the
lone cabin and beat the underbrush all
day without getting further trace of the
fugitive.
Deputy M'Coiiough said to-night he
considers it impossible for Moore to
elude pursuit another day. In the
morning the searching party will be
reinforced by a large posse from
Nevada City, headed by sheriff Get
chell. It will surround that portion of
the ridge between the French reservoir
and the Oak Tree ranch and thorough
ly search the country between th<
points.
There is good reason to suppose

hiding place, situated high on the slope
of Lone Ridge, giving its occupa

nearest thing to Evans and Sontag's
stone corral that one could imagin
Citizens from all of the neighboring
towns are preparing to join the pur
suing posses in the morning. If the
manhunters pick up the trail aeain in
the morning they hope to put an end
to his flight before sundown. It is evi
dent Moore attempted to take the route
outlined in The Call yesterday, but was
1 to journey westward away from
the snow, which at pres.-nt is fully fif
teen feet deep on the Sierras. Much
speculation is being indulged in here
to-night as to the route Moore took
in reaching this locality. Moore would
have to make his way through the
New York Canyon and cross the South
Yuba River at the electric power dam
or Purdom's Bridge. Both of these
crossings are bare of habitation and
Moore easily could have taken to the
road at either point without fear of
detection. If the Yuba River were not
such a raging torrent as it is at this
season of the year the fugitive might
have crossed it at any point farther
RUSSIA'S SERIOUS
LABOR TROUBLES
LONDON, April 6.â The St. Petersburg correspondent of the Times &

troubles and strikes in the manufacturing districts of Russia. Ominous â¢*

west and fought shy of this vicinity,
ients here believe Moore did not
know he was so close to the town,
otherwise he would have kept hieher
up on the ridge to make certain of
avoiding detection. To-night Deputy
Sheriff McCollough said it was his
opinion that Moore's only means of es
cape would he to climb clear over Lone
Ridije, down through Moore's Flat and
across Allegheny into the Sierra Val
ley. As before indicated Moore would
scarcely attempt this perilous Journey
through the snow.
"We have him cornered up there on
the ridge just as sure as you were
born," said he. "Moore's jig is about
up and I think we will brine him in
either dead or alive within the next
twenty-four hours, mostly dead, how
ever, for I don't think it* will be wise
to take ar.v chances with the mur
derer. He is a desperate character and
can shoot accurately. It don't do to
tak^ any chances with desperadoes of
that sort, so I think the hoys will till
him full of lead on sight."
SAY THEY SAW MOORE.
.Chinese Near Nevada City Give the
Sheriff a Clew.
NEVADA CITY, April 5. â Sheriff
Getchell thinks he has a tangible and
satisfactory clew to the trail of Ed
Moore. To-day he and Deputy Pascoe
and others went down to the Nettleship
farm, between Grass Valley and Bear
River, where Farmer "Jack" Nettle
ship believes he saw Moore yesterday
morning. The officers found a Chinese
boss of the gang of woodchoppers work,
ing in that section who tells a story
that is given credence. His name is
Ah Goon and he is vouched for by
everybody in that section as being re
liable. When Moore's photograph was
shown to him he said:
"That man come to my cabin at dark
Monday night He ask for water and I
tell him where to get it. I make no
mistake, sure."
irley Lee, a Chinese living a mile
away and belonging to th^ same gang,
positively identified the photograph as
that of a man who called at his place
yesterday morning and asked for water.
The Sheriff sent a courier to the county
seat to-night saying he and his posse
wore on a hot trail and would keep on
the move all night in the hope of strik
ing Moore's camp fire, with the mur
derer rolled up in his blankets beside it.
At 8 o'clock to-night an effort was
made to communicate by telephone
with the Sheriff to inform" him of the
clew reported from North San Juan, but
he had gone back into the jungle with
his manhunters and could not be
reached.

TWO AGED MEN
VICTIMS OF FIRE
Remarkable Similarity
of Accidents.
Special Dtspatch to The Call.
SAN ANDREAS, April s.â Side by
side in the County Hospital of Cala
veras two old men are dying. Both
are horribly burned, the result of simi
lar accidents occurring on the same day
and almost at the same time, though
the victims were a half mile apart.
Adolph Teidemann is a German, 73
years of age.' His fellow sufferer, An
tile Nane. is also a German, 63 years
old. Both men a unmarried and each
lived alone in a little cabin near Rail
road Flat. Their ahodes were about a
half mile apart. Each man was by his
own fireside when he sustained the
burns that will cause his death. To
this extent the cases are exactly simi
lar. The only difference is in the
causes of the accidents and the portions
of the bodies burned.
On Monday night Nane went home
under the influence of liquqr arid while
intoxicated tipped over a lamp. The
burning oil spread rapidly over the
room and the clothing of the old man
and he was soon enveloped in flames.
When rescued his body from the waist
down to the feet was literally baked
to a crisp.
Teidemann went to his lonely cabin
on Monday night after having imbibed
more whisky than he could carry safe
ly. He succeeded in building a roaring
fire in the -zr^at open fireplace in the
cabin and presumably sat down before
the burning Ings to smoke. It is sup
posed the unfortunate man dropped
into a drunken sleep and fell forward
into the fireplace. How he escaped be
ing roasted into a cinder before a
chance arrival pulled him from the fire
is a mystery that will never be solved.
Teidemann is kept under the influence
of opiates constantly to relieve him
from' the awful agony he would other
wise suffer. He will never speak again.
Teidemann's appearance inspires hor
ror, even to the surgeons and hospital
attendants, accustomed as they are to
scenes of suffering. He is actually
baked through and through the chest,
trunk, back and left arm.

WOULD NOT SERVE
MILADY IN BLOOMERS
LONDON. April 5.â test case which
has excited great interest in cycling cir
cles was decided at the Kingston Ses
sions to-day when Lady Harberton
charged the landlady of a hotel with hav
ing refused to serve her because she was
attired in bloomers. Lady Harberton,
who is treasurer of the Rational Dress
League, said on the witness stand that
she had traveled 4000 miles and through
the west end of London in bloomers. The
landlady pleaded that she only refused to

her business would be ruined if she was
obliged to serve some women attired in
bloomers.

DREYFUS CASE
REVELATIONS
Figaro Exposes General
Gonse's Acts.
Special Cable to The Call and the New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1899, by James Gor
don Dennett.
PARIS, April s.â Hitherto the Fig
aro's revelations have contained noth
ing startling, but the deposition of M.
Bertulus, to be published to-morrow
morning, is most sensational.
It contains a statement that General
Gonse asked him to inform Colonel
Picquart that his whole future career
depended upon his attitude at the Zola
trial, and the confession of a woman
says that she wrote the Speranza tele
gram and the Paty dv Clam Blanche
telegram.
Its great feature is an acccount of
the scene with Colonel Henry, who
came from the War Ministry to exam
ine the seized papers, among which
were these two documents, which
proved that Esterhazy and Paty dv
Clam. had obtained culpable aid from
the Bureau dcs Renseignments. Colonel
Henry was struck dumb. M. Bertulus
then told him that Esterhazy had writ
ten before the Dreyfus case letters say
ing that Henry was incapable, needy
and his debtor. ML Bertulus pointed out
that these might warrant the conclu
sion that Colonel Henry had furnished
Esterhazy with information.
Henry vvaÂ« dumbstruck. Then sud
denly he embraced the magistrate and
kissed him many times, repeating,
"Save us."
At the next interview Henry, having
seen his chiefs, showed no uneasiness.
M. Bortulus is positive thai the veiled
lady was Paty dv Clam.
The Voltaire, emulating the Figaro,
to-day published an installment of
Dreyfus evidence in the shape of For
eign Office documents, in which it is
set forth that the Foreign Office re
ceived several official denials from
Colonel Schwartzkoppen, the former
German military attache here, and
from the Italian Government, em
phatically denying that they had had
relations with Dreyfus.
A document is published by the Vol
taire also showing that the French
Foreign Office intercepted a cc-ded tele
gram addressed by Colonel Pannissardi,
the former Italian military attache at
Paris, to his Government, showing that
he did not know Dreyfus.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
HARRISBURG, Pa,, April s.â The
bribery investigation committee re

expects to complete the hearing of wit

next Monday.
William Wilson of Westmoreland,
who testified at the previous meeting
of the committee that he was twice of

Colonel Huff to Senator Quayâ half \
cash and the balance after he had j
voted â and then declined to give the
name of the person who made the al
leged offer, was the first witness called
to-day. Mr. Young moved that the wit
ness be excused until 2 o'clock in order
that he might consult with his attor- i
ney. Without putting the motion
Chairman Fow said to Wilson:
"Do you know John R. Byrne, who
ran for the State Senate in the Fayette !
Green District last fall and was de
feated?"
"I do."
"Was it he who made this offer to
you?"
"I decline to answer."
Chairman Fow advised Wilson that 1
he would place him in the custody of j
| the sergeant-at-arms for contempt un-'
j less he answered the question. Pend- i
ing such action, however, the motion to j
extend Mr. Wilson's time until after

FOR THE WIDOWS AND THE ORPHANS.
/^*OXFROXTED by the action of the Board of
I Supervisors reducing the price of lighting to
consumers in this cay from the former extor
t:onate rates to a reasonable charge, the gas com
as up the old familiar wail that ruin and deso
lation is about to befall the widow and the orphan.
The argument of the monopoly virtually amounts
to a plea that the people of San Francisco should
continue to pay excessive charges for gas and for
e'ectric lights as an act of charity to the widow and
the fatherless. The assertion is that widows own
stock and orphans own stock in the company, and
that a reduction of revenue to the company means
destitution in the homes of these dependent ones.
Such a plea, no matter with what tearful eloquence
pleaded, nor with what amount of money its publi
cation : I in corporation journals, cannot
affect t - tent of intelligent men. A due con
sideration of the needs of the great majority of
widows and orphan* in this city requires ihat extor
tionate rates shall be prohibited. For one
widow who owns stock in the gas company there are
fifty who do not. For one orphan who would be bene
fited by the triumph of the monopoly there are a
hundred who would be injured.
Shall a few widows and orphans who have invested
t'nTir earnings in watered gas stock go about bearing
upon their bones the meat furnished by thousands of
other widows and orphans?
Moreover, the claims for justice of the widows and
the fatherless among the stockholders should be di
rected not against the public but against the company
that i-^ued watered stock a:ul sold it to such innocent
purchasers. Even at the rates fixed by the Super
s the gas company can pay ample dividends on
all its rightful capitalization. It has no right what
. after having put forth shares representing a fic
titious capital, to now demand that the public shall"
bull those shares in the stock market ur consenting
to pay exorbitant rates tor pa=;.
The gas company, however, is not the only sinner
in this respect, nor by any mean's the greatest. That
domineering monopoly known as the telephone com
pany has a long score of offenses against the public
to be dealt with. It is another charger of extortion
ate rates, ostensibly for the benefit of the widow and
t!;e orphan. For that company also a day of reckon
ing is coming, when competition will compel it to
.give San Francisco a better service for less money or
gait the business.
Investigations made by the Postoffice Department
of London have disclosed that telephones can be
profitably operated in that city for Â£3. or about $15, a
\ear. The experience of several cities in the United
States has shown that where competing telephones
are in operation the cost to the public is hardly one
half what is charged by the monopoly here. That
fact was fully brought out by Congressional investi
gation resulting from extortionate telephone charges
in Washington City.
The telephone monopoly in this city not only
charges rates so high as to prevent the great majority
of widows and orphans from Having the benefits of
the invention, but the service is poor, and, as has been
shown by The Call, the secrets of patrons are frc
qurntly betrayed by the company or its employes to
rivals in business, or to spies, or to almost any one
who will pay for them.
It is lull time that San Francisco were rid of the
bvrdens and the vexations of this monopoly, and
fortunately the end is near at hand. In this case, as
in that of the gas company, moreover, the fight is
made for the public generally, including the widow
and the orphan.
REMEMBER THE HEROIC DEAD.
REMEMBER the heroic dead whose bodies are
to be buried in the historic cemetery of Arling
ton to-day, and in whose honor the President
has ordered that the flags of the nation shall be dis
played at half-mast during the afternoon.
The people should unite with the Government in
this solemn commemoration. Let every flag in San
Francisco be made an evidence of the sympathy of
the citizens with the simple but solemn ceremony
that will to-day engage the attention of the national
"capital. Float every flag at half-mast. The service
should not be overlooked in any office, or store, or
factory, or household in the city. It is the duty of
all.
\\ herever there is a nuisance there is a way to get
rid of it. and accordingly it would be worth while for.
the Supervisors to give the turntable at Lotta's foun
tain another whirl in the courts.
TH^ JURY SYSTEM.
THE present Governor of the State has been se
verely and justly criticized for his failure to sign
amendments to the Code of Civil Procedure that
would have improved the manner of selecting jurors.
j But it may as- well be understood by the public that
j the deepest evils in our jury system grow out of the
' manner of its administration and cannot be cured
merely by legislation. Occasional investigations are
paraded and the country for brief periods imagines
[ that public exposure will insure actual reform.
These spectacular episodes, however, are usually
mere sideshows that do not even ruffle the serenity
of the men who are really conversant with the
methods employed in "influenced" litigation.
There is nothing more difficult to trace and to
prove than the "fixing" of juries. But there are
some observed facts that go a long way in the right
! direction. For example, there are many persons of
| limited incomes, retired from active business, who
seek to get their names in the jury-box or on special
venires, of which many are summoned at the City
Hall and in interior counties where "Courthouse
rings" exist. This is accomplished by suggestion,
usually through friends within and without municipal
! and county offices. Of these men some are honest j
I and simply anxious to earn a per diem. But the
â¢ practice is vicious, for it opens the door to the pol
, luted hacks who aspire only to opportunities to per
vert justice, either by controlling verdicts or forcing
disagreements. Again: A panel of jurors drawn
from a box will probably contain a fajr proportion of
| reputable citizens, not anxious to. serve, but also a
I number who are so thoroughly trained and ex
| perienced that they can begin a trial with a fixed pur- |
1 pose to disregard the evidence, and achieve their ob- j
â¢ ject without danger of exposure. These villains, for
such they are, promptly obey every call. They are
1 letter perfect on their voir dire and never reveal
( knowledge of a party or of the subject matter at is
; sue or any bias, prejudice or opinion whatever. After
| four peremptory challenges on each side they cannot
be excluded, and once sworn the mischief is done.
A striking illustration of this method of corruption
! deserves notice. In an action against a railroad cor
i poration the regular panel in a department of the
Superior Court consisted of no citizens, or there-
I abouts, of whom eighty were beyond criticism, and
; the others mainly belonged to the wretched class we
have described. There, as in other departments, after
; the panel had been drawn, in order to minimize the
; inconvenience of service, jurors were specially noti
fied to attend by postal-cards, sent by the clerk or by
the bailiff. In the case before us, where the prelim
inary tests were necessarily rigid, the box was filled
up eight times before a full jury was obtained.
. Eighty-two jurors, the best of the lot, failed to an
swer when their names were called. The others were
all present, and a disagreement inevitably followed.
. It appears certain that in this instance, endlessly re
peated, for some occult reason many notices were
,' suppressed.
Such frauds are perpetrated under the judicial eye
i and in such an example as we have given connivance
,by court officers was essential to success. The Judges
: are unconscious of the rascality, which could be
easily blocked by alertness on their part. But there
j are many ways, both in original selection and in
specific trials, in which tainted and cunning agents of
special interests succeed in defeating righteous judg
ment. The weaknesses, the necessities and the sur
, roundings of 'jurors are studied, and they are sub
jected to the most insidious approaches. Corrupt ver
dicts or equally corrupt disagreements are not al
ways procured by the direct expenditures of money.
The influences employed are as diverse as individual \
' situations and temperaments.
It is said that there are corporations in San Fran
cisco that, for their own guidance, have descriptive
lists of citizens eligible to jury duty, and who instruct
their attorneys, so that they can select jurors prac
tically without examination. This enormous advan
tage over ordinary litigants produces marked inequal
ity before the law.
The jury system is necessary to free government.
Most American citizens make honest jurors. But it
is too evident for discussion that while safeguards in
selection, such as those incorporated into the amend
ments discarded by the Governor, are important, in
creased vigilance and more practical discrimination
by courts, by their officers and by the bar, are even of
more vital consequence.
FRUIT GROWING IN FLORIDA
T~\ CCORDIXG to a Floridian correspondent o
f\ the Savannah News, the outlook lor the pro
* * duction of tropical fruit in Florida is by no
means promising. After pointing out that for sev
eral winters in succession the fruit crops have been
killed, and that the various means resorted to f_o
protection have proven ineffectual, the writer says
"Major George R. Fairbanks, an old and highly es
teemed citizen of Florida, says our climate has no
changed; that freezes have always prevailed here
But Major Fairbanks does not live in South Florida
his home being in the old seaport city of Fernandina
We of South Florida know that the climate has
changed in a general way; that we are now unable
to grow guavas. bananas and sometimes mulberries
and that our young budded orange trees are killec
Pred every winter."
st not be supposed that Floridians suffered the
ive losses of their crops without making earnes
â t!y efforts to save them. The trees were bankec
with earth and leaves, fires were kept burning in the
orchards on cold nights, and high fences were erecte<
X windbreaks; 6ut all in vain. It is noted by the
er to whom we have referred that even the coy
ering of groves with close sheds, as Millionaire Stet
son has done at De Land, did not save exposed trees
without the aid of well-kept-up fires inside the in
clcsure.
It appears from that record that the growing of
oranges and pineapples in Florida can be made a safe
business onl}- where the orchards are covered from
wind and rain and are- warmed by fires. That means
every orchard must be made virtually a conservatory.
Such being the conditions of the industry in that
State, it is not likely to prove profitable in the face of
the increasing competition of California.
Whether the theory that the climate of Southern
Florida has changed can be sustained or not, it is
certain a remarkable change has occurred in the fruit
industry of the State. Thousands of people have gone
to Florida within the last few years to engage in
orange growing, lands were sold at boom prices and
millions of money were invested by settlers who ex
pected to obtain large profits from their venture. Re
cently these orchards have been mowed down by
frosts as a wheat field is shorn by a harvester. Main
families have lost about all they ever possessed, and
the outlook is so discouraging that a considerable
number have lost hope as well as fortune.
Of course in the end the Floridians will find some
industry which can be counted on. The State has
many resources and many attractions, and American
energy- and skill can be relied upon to make profitable
k use of them. For the time being, however, it looks as^

if the Floridians would have to live mainly on game
and fish and rely for money upon Northern tourists
and the sale of phosphates.
THE ZIONIST MOVEMENT.
THE persistence of the Jew as a part of the mod
ern world and distinct from it is one of the mar
vels of the world. That race has taken a fore
most place in art, science and finance, and has been at
the head in major statesmanship and has played no
mean part in war. At the same time it has remained
as distinct as it was before Moses led it out of
Egyptian bondage into the freedom of the wilderness.
Its history is an impressive story of the mighty pre
potency of the great nomads from whom it sprang,
for out of their shepherd tents issued a line of
prophets, priests and kings outdazzling the rulers of
the first empires, and leaving behind a literature
which is the world's greatest religious and intellectual
inspiration in these latter days.
Where are the people of Babylon? Where the race
of Jamshyd? Where now the blood of the Mace
donian conqueror? What commou principle and
frith is there to lead the modern Latins in recreating
the glories of Rome on the soil where they flourished?
What trumpet-blast shall resurrect the one purpose
and assemble the people of the blood that built the
empire of Charlemagne? Division, destruction,, the
melting of common bonds, make up the history of
them all.
But between the black Jew, who lives neighbor to
the Tamils and responds to their language as old as
Sanskrit, in the speech in which Abraham uttered
prayers over his dead, and the cringing Russian
Hebrew and the lordly capitalists of Frankfort and
the English Jew, who has seen his race rule the Brit
ish empire and preside over the Capitol of the Anglo-
Saxon world, there is the old tie of the tribes, made
in the wilderness, before the Ark of the Covenant,
that has persisted unbroken, while the race has been
scattered like ashes to the four winds, has borne the
yoke of oppression and the lash of persecution,
groaned in bonds and tasted death in every form
zealots can invent and cruelty inflict. Running with
this common tie has long been an aspiration to pos
sess Palestine again, to repeople the land which their
fathers entered when it was full of corn and wine,
flowing with milk and honey.
The movement toward Zion has taken organized
shape. The Jew in all lands lifts his face toward
Judea, and the whole world is for an hour withdrawn
from its strifes and struggles to look upon a move
ment that is of greater interest than the exploiting of
a new continent.
To repeople Palestine requires that the land be re
clad in the forests that made it fruitful. Where the
daughters of Shiloh were found dancing in the vine
yards by the sons of Benjamin the blear sands scorch
in the sun. Naboth's vineyard is as dry as the bones
of Jezebel. Where Ruth gleaned in the field no green
blade is tipped with dew. The springs and wells
around which the people rested on the way to the
Passover, no longer affluent, feed no rills.
The forests are gone, and the beauty of the land
and its fountains went with them. The early and the
latter rain falls upon the sand. If Israel move upon
the land again to restore it the first energy expended
must be in bringing back its trees and fountains. In
this respect alone the Zionist movement is of first in
terest to the world. The desert has claimed the seat
of the shepherd kings: Babylon, Palmyra, the great
scats of ancient empire, are all buried in the sands,
and there are none to resurrect them. If the Jew go
back to Zion and, applying that persistence which has
marked his race, shall recall the verdure, the mea
dow?, the vineyards, the bosky glens and sweet oases,
the possession of which called out all the poetry in the
souls of his fathers, a work will be done hardly sec
ond to the Exodus.
THE TURNTOBL,E CfISE.
OUR esteemed contemporary, the Chronicle,
considers that Judge Bahrs, in his decision in
the Geary-Street turntable case, evaded the
main proposition by deciding that no issue was pre
sented on the question of nuisance. It is the opinion
of this able journalistic counsel that the lawyers for
the Superintendent of Streets got a nuisance before
the court in their pleadings, and it is unable to see
how Judge Bahrs could sustain the objections of the
railroad without doing violence Jo what it calls
"equity."
If our contemporary were as familiar with equity as
it is with turntables it would know that no man can
appeal to equity who has a speedy, complete and
adequate remedy at law. This may sound a trifle
technical to the average reader of newspaper law, but
it ought to be entirely familiar to the Chronicle,
which in the domain of judicial journalism occupies
the same position that Chief Justice Beatty occupies
in the jurisprudence of the State.
Judge Bahrs has simply held in the case under
consideration that the proper remedy for abating
nuisances such as the Geary-street turntable is alleged
to be is an action at law. In an action at law a jury
may be impaneled and the fact whether or not the
turntable is a nuisance tried according to the rules of
law. In other words, he holds that the question of
nuisance cannot be debated in an application for a
writ of injunction, which is an equitable proceeding.
Though we claim no precedence at the bar, we yen- j
ture to say that this position is eminently correct, j
not only on legal technical grounds, but on broad i

The turntable of the Geary Street Company may be,
and probably is, a nuisance. If it did nothing more
than annoy our contemporary we should consider it
a flagrant nuisance. But there is a legal and proper |
way of ascertaining its character and procuring its j

through resolutions by Boards of Supervisors and
raids in pursuance thereof by Superintendents of
Streets.
However, our esteemed contemporary may easily
ascertain whether or not Judge Bahrs is right. It can
take his decision to the Supreme Court, which has
everybody's confidence and which rarely gets off the

tribunal will uphold him.

THE GOVERNOR AND
THE JURY STUFFERS
SAN FRANCISCO, April 3, 1899.
To the Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: The action of Governor Gage in
vetoing Senate bill No. 202, known as the "Braunhart bill," introduced by
Senator Braunhart, the passage of which was ably advocated by The Call,
has been a source of regret to those interested in the amelioration of the
evils of the jury system in this city and county.
The bill was aimed at the abuses which have crept into the jury sys
tem and which were so fully exposed by the public press generally in San
Francisco during the last year.
As was fully shown by the press in the year 1597, in this city and
county, out of claims aggregating $325,000 the Market-street Railway Com
pany was compelled to pay only $5000 in one year and the Southern Pa
cific Company escaped with a loss of only $500 out of claims aggregating
$200,000. This is the condition of affairs that the bill was designed to rem
edy and that it would have proved effectual there can be no doubt.
Heretofore it had been the custom for jurors to serve year after year,
and they were transferred from one department of the Superior Court to an
other. The bill in question provided that a juror should serve on only five
cases during a year, and then it provided he was to be excused from further
duty. This would not only kill the occupation of the "professional juror,"
but would remove the objection that business men have to serving on
juries. Had this bill received the seal of executive approval it would have
been reasonable to predict that the Market-street Railway Company and the
Southern Pacific Company would -have provided their cars with fenders as
provided by law and would have in other respects conformed to the regula
tions of the State and city for their government, but it is fair to assume that
they will now do in the future as they have done in the past, viz., refuse
to equip their cars with the proper appliances for saving lift and defy the
provisions of the law, knowing that it is cheaper to rely upon a "stuffed"
jury than to incur the expense necessary to enable them to carry on their
business lawfully and with due regard for the safety of human life.
The chief executive cannot plead ignorance of the existence of the evils
this bill was designed to remedy. The legislators were fully advised of the
abuses of the jury system and promptly assented to the measure, knowing
it was a move in the direction of decency and right.
Besides the newspapers of the city and county of San Francisco, the
Superior Judges, many of the officers and members of the Bar Association,
the leading members of the legal profession. County Clerk Deane and his
efficient chief deputy, Joseph Goddard, had all announced their approval of
the measure and many of them were active in securing its passage.
And furthermore, the writer, having drawn the measure, thought it
proper to put before the Governor the facts and circumstances that led to
the preparation and introduction of the bill, which he did in due time in a
communication forwarded to the Governor.
If in the stress of official duties the Governor overlooked the bill in ques
tion then, of course, the offense can be condoned, but if upon his own respon
sibility or moved by some occult influence he intentionally "pocketed" the
measure he places himself in the attitude of aiding and abetting the case
fixer and jury-stuffer.
It is a matter of sincere regret to those interested in a decent and or
derly administration of justice, especially in the city and county of San
Francisco, that a piece of legislation of grave importance to the proper ad
ministration of law in this city and far-reaching !n its beneficent effects on
our courts, after having secured the unanimous vote of the Legislature,
should be rendered ineffectual through executive neglect, taking the most
charitable aspect of the case. Very sincerely, S. V. COSTELLO.

GAGE DISGRACED THE STATE.
V Governor Gage did not sign the bill authorizing the payment to
Q Claus Spreckels of the $26,000 advanced by him for the relief of the
S> drought victims of San Luis Obispo and Monterey counties. Some
3> months ago the people of those communities were actually suffering for
# the want of food for themselves and their stock. The Examiner organ
Â§ized relief expeditions and sent many carloads of food to the sufferers,
but this was not sufficient and so the people appealed to the State for
$ aid. It happened that the State had no fund that could be legally used
g for such a purpose, although not a voice was raised against the idea
of the State rendering the aid. Then it was suggested that if some
$ one with money would advance $25,000 for the immediate relief of the
Â£ sufferers, whose needs were urgent, the amount would be returned by
3> an appropriation of the next Legislature to whoever would advance it
Â± Claus Spreckels. the big-hearted capitalist, put up the money, and in ac-
cordance with the agreement the Legislature passed a bill reimbursing
him. Now comes the news that Governor Gage refused to sign the bill

City. While the Romans have directly
given us the names of the months, we
have immediately derived those of the

Romans, however, and the Saxons the i
several days were dedicated to the chief I
national deities and in the character of
these several sets of national deities
there is in nearly every Instance an ob
vious analogy and correspondence; so
that the Roman names have undergone
little more than a translation in the

Stock Quotations Steady.
San Francisco Gas and Electric stocÃ
was steady on the Stock and Bond Ex
change yesterday, opening at 73 and clos
ing at 72%. This is a fraction higher than
the closing quotations Tuesday and but
a point or so undor the market price for
the stock before the action of the Board
of Supervisors in reducing the rate to
j consumers from $1 75 to $1 10 on Monday
\ afternoon. The predictions freely made
I Tuesday night that the stock would go
by the board when the exchange opened
for business yesterday morning were not
realized. On the contrary, many orders
to sell, received by brokers after closing
hours Tuesday, had been canceled before
the doors of the exchange were opened
yesterday, and the market remained firm
In consequence. All kinds of rumors were
in circulation on the 'street as to the cause
of the sudden abatement of the flurry,
but there .was no excitement.
The true reason is believed to be con
tained in a report that was persistently
circulated during the day to the effect
that the Board of Supervisors would at
its meeting next Monday rescind its ac
tion fixing the rate at $1 10 a thousand
feet and order the rate fixed at $1 50 a
thousand. It is claimed that several of
the Supervisors who voted for the big cut
at the meeting last Monday feel that they
made a mistake and the indications that
the matter will be reconsidered are of
such a positive character that there
seems to be little doubt that such action
will be taken. The Supervisors who are
supposed to have experienced a change or
heart on the subject of gas rates are
said to have been influenced by the fear
that an arbitrary reduction in the rate
would work a great hardship on the small
holders of gas and electric stock, the
"widows and orphans."
President Crockett nf the gas company
says there is no foundation for the state
ment that the company has already di
rected its attorneys to apply to the courts
for an injunction to restain the city from
enforcing the order fixing the rate at $1 10.
The directors of the gas company at their
meeting yesterday morning referred the
whole matter to the attorneys for the
company for investigation and a report.
"This is an important question, said
President Crockett last night, "and our
attorneys have been instructed to inves
tigate our rights under the law. That
was the only action taken by the direct
ors at their meeting this morning, and
they will take no further steps until our
attorneys have made their report. In
matters of policy the actions of the di
rectors are influenced by their own judg
ment, but in legal matters such as this
our course would naturally be according
to the advice of our legal advisers."
President Crockett knew nothing of the
report that the Board of Supervisors
would probably rescind its action at its
next meeting, and he declined to say
what effect such action would have on the
future policy of the gas company. He
would not say whether he would be satis
fied with the rate to consumers fixed at
I $1 SO, contending that that %vas a question
; that could only be answered by the board
i of directors.
There seems to be a misunderstanding
I as to the power of Mayor Phelan in the
! fixing of the rate to consumers. It has
â  been stated that the gas company confi
dently expected that the Mayor would
! veto the resolution passed by the Super
! visors on the ground that the cut was too
i deep and unfair to the corporation. But
Mayor Phelan will not make use of his
veto, as according to his own statement
he has no authority to do so, even were
he so inclined. The Mayor says that the
power to fix the rate at which gas shall
be furnished to private consumers lies
entirely with the Board of Supervisors
and that the action of the board in the
i premises is Inal, unless the board should
j see fit to reconsider the matter of its own
volition.
Should the Supervisors rescind their ac
tion and fix the rate at $1 SO next Monday
there is likely to be a great deal of insin
uating talk concerning their motives and
the influences which tended to bring about
such a sudden and radical change in their
ideas of what the people and the gas com
pany are respectively entitled to. It may
be that they will be influenced solely by
a desire to protect the small holders of
gas stock, who would be ruined by a de
preciation in the value of their securities,
but the majority of the people of San
Francisco will hardly accept this as the
true reason for such action on their part.
The Supervisors are disinclined to discuss
the matter, and it probably will not be
definitely known until the board meets
next Monday whether such action is con
templated, or if contemplated whether
the Supervisors wil not in the meantime
experience another change of heart.

Two questions of
to the city were consid
:ng of permission to any
nee or project
tor lighting purposes
in the uutlying districts, and the niadng
â¢ s underground in the business
section of the city.
The discussion, which extended over
several hours, was of a desultory char
acter. It was participated In by Mayor
l'helan, A. B. Spreckels, A. S. Baldwin,
\V r . R. Hewitt. J. C. Quinn, J. B. Corn
wall and Manager Summerhayes of the
Mutual Electric Light Company. Mr.
Spreckels was present as a representa
tive of the recently incorporated lnde-
I endent Electric Light and Power Com
pany, and took an active part in the dis
cussion.
The dominant Idea was to formulate
a plan when -h>- the unnecessary en
of poies could be prevented. It was held
that if this privilege was granted to all
who might apply, the sidewalks wouid
be Hned with unsightly poles and the city
â¢ d with a network of wires. The
suggested to avoid this condition
the letting by the city of a fran
rhise to one cpmpanj to erect pules
whreh would carry the wires of all com
panies.
iution introduced by Dr. Per
â ring the matter was read and
u-.i amendment suggested. The original
.:ion read:
Resolved, That permission is .hereby
granted to all Incorporated companies or
. corporations having a plant projected or
in operation to supply the inhabitants of
this city and county with artificial light,
to er*ct poles on and wires over the
streets in this city and county within the
outlying districts of the fire limits.
The suggested amendment was not act
ed upon, the committee having no powers
in the premises. It was a3 follows:
Pnovided, that the first company erect
ing or having erected poles within said
limit* should erect or maintain the same
to allow sufficient accommodation for the
wires of other companies under such con
ditions as to the expense as may be. pre
scribed by the beard to be defrayed by
said companies as to the cost of erection
of *ald poles and their maintenance, it be
ing distinctly understood that the privi
lege granted shall not allow of poles being
. â¢ erected by any other company on streets
where poles have been erected by the
â¢.company first availing itself of this privi
lege, and In such cases where additional
poles are required the Superintendent of
the Fire Alarm shall first be notified and
. permiFSlon obtained from said superin
â  tendent for the erection, who shall desig
nate the location of the same.
Mayor Phelan promised to prepare a
Craft of a franchise which will he sub
mitted at the next meeting of the com
mittee. For poles alone his Honor
thought a modest Incorporation mierht be
formed to handle the proposition. He be
lieved a short franchise, one not extend
ing over ten years, would be Just to the

R. Hewitt, superintendent of the fire
alarm and police telegraph, was requested
to submit specifications for the laying out
of the proposed Bystem. This will Include
ar. estimate of the service required in va
rious parts of the city, the size of poled
and other information.
The discussion developed the fact that
the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company has only a revocable privilege in
the use of the Ktrpf-ts for the erection of
poles, and not a hard and fast monopoly
which could not be wrested from its
grasp.
The effort to have wires placed under
ground within certain limits is expected to
prove successful. The question to be de
rided is as to the limits within which this
action shall be taken. It is conceded the
fire limits cover too large an area. The in
tention is to allow the Â«mpanies owning
wires sixty days in which to commence
tak-ing down the wires. The work to be
completed in from eight months to a year.
Wren the meeting was called to order
by Chairman Aigeltinger Mr. Baldwin ex
plained that the Merchants' Association
â  ! to take a stand on the
questions to be discussed owing to lack of
time to consider them. They were of too
great importance to the city to be acted
upon hastily.
Supervisor Aigeltinger. in the course of
the general discussion tha*
wanted to learn if the city could have
competition in lighting without the va
rious companies having the rieht to
erpct poles, which privilege carried in its
train the disfiguring of the city. Mr.
Baldwin said every resident and r" 1 ! l
erty-owner favored competition and fa
vored any plan that would bring it about.
Mr. Spreckels suggested that the Mer
chants' Association meet and suggest
plans. To this Mr. Baldwin replied that
Bsodation would do anything possi
ble to produce competition, and thus give
light at a low. reasonable rate. Mr.
Summerhayes of the Mutual Company
said if his people were placed on the
samo footing as the rival company they
would guarantee to supply light for 33 1-3
per cent less than the nrice now charged.
Mr. Baldwin asked Mr. Spreckels what
were his views regarding the use of one
set of poles in common by all the com
panies. "The privilege should, properly.
be given any company to use the poles
In existence upon payment of
sonablf compensation." said Mr. Spreck
els. "Independent poles for each com
pany would not be reasonable. Tt would
mar the beauty of the city by filling the
sidewalks with unsightly ooles."
Mr. Cromwoll said if Mutual Com
pany be granted the right to erect poles
It would be willing to allow Mr. Spreck
els' company the use of them, Jointly.
The city would also be granted the use
of the poles for its fire alarm and police
telegraph. Beyond that he did not <-are
to farm out the use of the polpp. Con
sideration of the matter will be resumed
next week. From the tenor of the Super
visors' remarks it is evident the lighting
field will be thrown open for competition
and the present monopoly broken down.

A Noonday Encounter in the Whole

Timothy Dugan. a porter in the employ
of Spruance, Stanley & Co., 410 Front
street, failed yesterday to murder his old
time friend. John C. Nobmann. secretary
of the Retail Grocers' Association,
through no fault of his own. The rare
pluck and presence of mind of Nobmann
were all that averted the tragedy. As it
was, while he dodged the bullet, which
lodged in the woodwork, he was neither
quick nor lucky enough to escape the
charge of burning powder that followed
the pulling of the trigger. He received
the blazing particles in his face, which is
deeply pitted with little black marks from
the center of his forehead to the. tip of
his left ear. He aleo received a couple of
the burning grains in his left eye, but
otherwise is uninjured. Dugan is in the
City Prison charged with assault to com
mit murder.
The shooting occurred shortly before
noon in the store of the Retail Grocers'
Association, 115 Clay street, and every
thing goes to show that Dugan went thero
for the purpose of killing Xobtnann. He
worked at Spruance, Stanley & Co.'s until
11 o'clock in the morning. Before leaving
he abstracted from one of the drawers in
an office desk a revolver belonging to
Halleck Wright, the bookkeeper. This
revolver was the one with which he did
the shooting, and it had not long been in
his possession before he used it.
At the time Dugan entered the office of
the Grocers' Association he was under the
influence of liquor. There were present
Xr.bmann and J. M. Sullivan, another
grocer. The dispute between the secre
tary of the association and Dugan began
at "once, about money matters they both
say, although it is supposed that a deeper
seated motive existed lor the disagree
ment. At any rate, it was not long before i
the disputants were indulging in high
words, which ended when Nobmann called
the porter, Henry Hoennig. and requested
him to eject Dugan. Hoennig took hold
of Dugan's aim and sought to lead him
to the sidewalk, while Nobmann, to get
out of the way, started through an alley
way of boxes for the rear of the store.
"For some reason that I cannot ex
plain, " said Nobmann after the shooting,
"I turned and looked back and saw Du
gun, within three feet of me, extend his
hand, containing a revolver. I jumped
for him and grabbed his arm just as the
cartridge exploded. 1 felt the sting in my
face and thought for a moment I was
shot. I grappled with Dugan for fear he j
would repeat the dose and soon had him
on the floor.
"After Dugan had been disarmed and
the policemen came," continued Nob- |
mann, "he said, "I did what I intended to
do.' J said, 'Did you?" and he replied,
"Yes, 1 did what I intended to do.' "
The rrport of the revolver gathered a
large crowd in no time and it was with
difficulty that Patrolmen McGlynn and
Shaw of the Harbor police station made
their way to Dugan, who had already
been disarmed by Nobmann and Hoennig,
the former receiving a badly cut finger
from a second snap of the trigger. He
was driven to the Harbor Hospital, where
his injuries were dressed by Dr. Himmels
bach.
Dugan was taken to the Harbor police
station, where he received a call from
ife, for whom he had sent to his
residence, 2044 Jones street. He refused
to make any statement for publication,
but told several of his friends that Nob
mann had houndr-d him for settlement of
pecuniary obligations. He said he had
no fear of prosecution, which g;ive ground
for the beliefnhat there was more behind
the shooting than mere dispute about
money.
Nobmann and Dugan have beon friends
from boyhood and their families have
maintained close social relations. Only
recently they occupied the same ark at
Tiburon for weeks.

HENRY HOCK
HELD UP BY
TWO FEMALES
Followed Him to His
Home.
ACTED LIKE PROFESSIONALS
THEY ARE ARRESTED AND IDEN
TIFIED BY THEIR VICTIM.
Both Charged With Grand Larceny
and Vagrancy and the Cases
Continued in the Police
Court.
A daring robbery was committed by two
young women at an early hour yesterday
morning, and they were both arrested on
charges of grand larceny and vagrancy.
The complaining witness against them is
Henry Hock, a brewer living at 1224 Turk
street. He boarded an Eddy-street car at
Powell street shortly after midnight and
two young women got on the car at the
same time. They sat on the dummy be
side him, and one of them, soon after the
car started, endeavored to engage him in
conversation. She was unsuccessful, a3
Hock felt annoyed at her impudence.
Hock got off the car at Webster street,
and to his surprise tne two young women
left the car at the same time, and he ob
served that they were following behind
him. It never occurred to him that they
had any evil designs upon him, and con
tinued his walk home still followed by ihe
young women.
As he reached the steps leading up to I
his front door the young women were I
close behind him, and the taller of the
two threw her arms around his neck i
in a tight embrace. Hock was j
too much taken aback to make
any resistance, and in less than a minute
she released her hold, and the two went
away laughing at him.
When he got home he discovered that j
his purse containing about JSO was miss
ing, and he suspected that while the taller j
of the two women held him round the j
neck the other went through his pockets i
and stole the purse. He returned to the I
street, and after wandering around in
search of a policeman he met Officers Mc-
Shane and Green. H" told his adven
ture to them and ga Â» them a descrip
tion of the two womei..
About 2 o'clock in the morning Mc-
Shane saw two women standing in the
doorway of a barbc-r-shop at Fulton and
Laguna* streets talking to the barber.
They answered the description of the two
who had robbed Hock and McShane ques
tioned them. He was not satisfied with
their answers and placed them under ar
n-.-t, sanding them to the City Prison in
the patrol wagon, where they were charg
ed with grand larceny and vagrancy.
They gave the names of Bessie Bond and
Gertrude Heightler. .
Hock called at the prison yesterday
morning and positively identified them,
Bessie being the. one who threw her arms
around hit; neck. They were taken before
Judge Mogan yesterday morning, and
the cases were continued till to-morrow.

DEATH SOUNDS ITS
VOICE IN BOHEMIA
Joseph D. Strong, Ar
tist and Clubman,
Passes Away.
ONCE more Bohemia is in
mourning. Another of its
brilliant lights has been ex
tinguished and swept be
yond the vigil of the owl. A
few weeks ago its revelry
paused while tears fell for
Daniel O'Connell, and now it weeps
for Joe Strong, club man and artist.
Strong- died suddenly yesterday
morning. He had had an operation
performed at Dr. McNutt's hospital
a couple of weeks ago, but it was
thought that he was recovering and
preparations were being made for
his removal to his home on the day
when his life unexpectedly flickered
out.
Joseph D. Strong was one of the
famed artists of America. The
work of his brush has found a

LOCAL TRAINS
TO BE OPERATED
ELECTRICITY
Plan Is Nqw Under
Consideration.
It may not be long before the patrons
of the Southern Pacific Company's lines
between San Francisco and Oakland, Ala
meda and Berkeley will have the pleasure
of riding on trains propelled with elec
tricity instead of steam. The project of
converting the local lines mentioned into
electric roads has been under considera
tion by the management of the Southern
Pacific Company for some time.
When the readjustment of the local
tracks on the Oakland mole was made
recently the probable change to electric
ity was kept in view. The work was done
in such a manner as to occasion the least
possible outlay and inconvenience when
the conversion is made.
The plans have progressed to the ex
tent of having an eminent expert fronÂ»
the East make a personal inspection of
the situation, with a view to making an
estimate of the cost of the improvement.
It is understood that this matter will be
considered during the presence of Presi
dent Huntington and the other Eastern
directors In this city.
While the first cost of the transforma
tion will be in the neighborhood of $1,000,
--000, the cost of operation will be about
one-half under an electric system of
what it is by steam.
With the inauguration of the electric
system will also probably come the twen
ty-minute ferry service. This has not
been put in up to the present time owing
to the greatly increased expense that
would necessarily be incurred, as both
the ferry-boat and train service would
have to be increased 50 per cent, and the
present traffic is said not to warrant this
added expenditure. Twenty-minute boats
are now occasionally run, when particu
larly heavy traffic is expected, but with
a big saving possible in the operation of
the train service it is likely that the irrore
frequent service will become a regular
thing, at least in the early morning and
evening hours, when the traffic is heav
iest.

leries of the United States, and
much of it has been sold in Lon
don. His particular specialty was
portrait painting, and the likeness
of many celebrities were reproduced
on his canvas. Several years ago
he visited the Hawaiian Islands and
later went to Apia, Samoa, where
he resided with Robert Louis
Stevenson, the stepfather of his
first wife. In the scenery of the
Oriental islands he found fit sub
jects for art and completed a very
fine collection of studies, sketches
and finished paintings. His work
was exhibited at the Columbian Ex
position in 1893 and again at the
Midwinter Fair. It was all charac
teristic of the barbaric life in the
bronzed tropics and was full of
force and beauty.
He returned to San Francisco
threo years ago and established a Q
studio. In speaking of it the Over
land Monthly says; "His studio A
was a strange mingling of Samoa
and San Francisco. Savage chiefs CJ
look at the visitors from the walls.
Palms and tropic sunsets and the Â£
deep blue of the equatorial ocean
give color to the room, and yet 9
among them are the familiar faces i
of Mr. Strong's present-day sitters, f
painted with a full brush and a 1
clean stroke that causes the face Â£
to stand out boldly from the can- 1
vas." Â£.
Strong recently accepted the con
tract for the painting of the por- Â£
trait of ex-Governor Budd. but had
not yet commenced it. When he
was taken ill he was just complet- y
Ing one of Joseph D. Grant. One
year ago he married Miss Elizabeth j
Haight, a niece of ex-Governor '
Haight, and she still survives him. â¢
He received his early study in Mv- '
nich, where he went from Oakland â¢
when a boy. Among his tutors
were Carl Piloty and Wagner, whose 9
"Chariot Race" delighted the world.
He was born in Bridgeport, Conn., â¢
wa3 45 years of age and leaves a
son 16 years of age, who is at pres- #
ent studying in New York. His
studio was at the corner of Kearny â¢
and Clay streets in this city.
The remains were removed to the 0
home of his wife's mother, Airs. S.

An Excellent Combination.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Syruj- of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig Syrup Co., illustrate
the value of obtaining the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be
medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing 1 to the
taste and acceptable to the system. It
is the one perfect strengthening laxa-
tive, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly and enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or irritating them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants, by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Co. only. In order to get its beneficial
effects and to avoid imitations, please
remember the full name of the Company

DR. KT-uMER'S REMEDIES.
How to Find Out.
Fill a bottle or common glass with
your water and let it stand twenty-four
hours; a sediment or settling indicates
an unhealthy condition of the kidneys;
if it stains your linen, it is evidence of
kidney trouble; too frequent desire to
pass it or pain in the back is also con-
vincing proof that the kidneys and
bladder are out of order.
What to Do.
There is comfort in the knowledge so
often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's
Swamp-Root, the great kidney remedy,
fulfills every wish in curing rheuma-
tism, pain in the back, kidneys, liver,
bladder and every part of the urinary
passage. It corrects inability to hold
water and scalding pain in passing it,
or bad effects following use of liquor,
wine or beer, and overcomes that un-
pleasant necessity of being compelled
to go often during the day and to get
up many times during the night. The
mild and extraordinary effect of
Swamp-Root is soon realized. It stands
the highest for its wonderful cures of
the most distressing cases. If you need
a medicine you should have the best.
Sold by druggists in fifty-cent and one-
dollar sizes.
You may have a sample bottle of this
wonderful discovery and a book that
tells more about it, both sent absolute-
ly free by mail. Address Dr. Kilmer &
Co.. Binghamton, N. Y. When writing
mention that you read this generous
offer in the San Francisco Daily Call.

NEW YORK. April s.â The market -u-as very
Irregular to-day, violent fluctuations being fre
quent. Sharp recessions appeared early. The
market rallied with a burst of strength in the
railroads in the hope of a favorable crop re
port. A sensational rise occurred in call money,
as high as 16 per cent being exacted for loans
on Industrial collateral, and later 15 per cent
Â»as reached on railways. The greater part of
the day loans were much below this figure, al
though it -was . lite general to charge a higher
rate on industrial collateral than on that of
railways. Extensive liquidation followed the
appearance of the highest money rate, so far
this season. T.here were many breaks of from
2 to 4 points from the highest quotations of the
day, but stocks recovered on covering and 6
l*r cent money at the clo6e. leaving the list
i-lijjhtly above yesterday"s figures, with the
tone steady. London sold a small amount of
j-tack. Manhattan receded over 2 points and
Third Avenue 5. Brooklyn Transit and Ameri
can Su-el and Wire were lifted over 2 points
tach. A rise of 3S points In Mexican Central
on enormous dealings was said to relate to a
plan to redistribute the capital, but nothing
definite came forward. Much of the buying of
this stock was said to come irom Boston
Mexican National had a sympathetic rise of
over a i-oint. The talk of favorable business
ITi*pects of Wabaah lifted the preferred stock
a substantial fraction on the large dealings.

THE â  MONEY MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 6.â Money near the close
of the stock market to-day reached 16 per cent
i for call loans. Then J. W. Sellgman & Co.
supplied the demand and offered money down
to 6 per cent. The exceptional demand was
due to the early rise of 58,000,000 due on ac
count of the American Smelting and Refining
Company's subscriptions.
THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, April The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were idle and were expected
to continue slack all week. Americans opened
bullish and were stagnant until New York
bought Wabash and the coalers. The rest were
neglected. Tintos were 41%i<1?41 7-16 on a fall
of 15 shillings In copper; Anacondas, 9 1-16;
Utah. 9%.
Money was hard. Bank loans have been
mostly prepaid, causing a scarcity of money
in the market. Silver was dull. America was
inclined to sell.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April s.â The filling of buying
orders which were sent in on account of the
! weakness on the curb yesterday, together with j
better cables abroad, gave wheat a fairly good j
I start. The Onion State crop report, however, I
| knocked the bull feeling out of the crowd. The ;
i report showed a condition of 85 compared with |
80 the year before and with 26 per cent of last
year's crop still in farmers' hands. May
j opened Me higher at 72%@72%c. sold sparingly
at 72'ic, then declined quickly to 70;Â»c. Liqui
| dation was heavy on the way down and a re
: covery did not set in until 'a general exchange ,
jof crop news from country correspondents i
among commission men established the uni- ''â 
versality of crop damage of a serious character
in all Western winter States outside of Ohio.
As the session neared the end these crop dam
age complaints became sensational and were
backed up by heavy buying orders from the :
. country. Shorts became nervous, and when an
attempt was made to cover offerings were found
to be very scarce. The competition became so
' great for what little was for sale that May
hesitating at TUic, Jumped quickly to 734 c
and closed at 73c. The fluctuations in July ;
were almost identical to that of May. and both '
j months kept closely in unison. May still kept
! the lead as to the volume of trading, but when
! changes to July could be made on even terms
i there was a disposition evinced by longs to
< transfer trades to the more deferred future.
Liquidation of long property depressed corn j
1 early. When the rapid rise in wheat got well
under way, however, shorts became alarmed !
and bought back former holdings, causing a i
sharp rally. May corn closed He higher.
Liberal selling by the country and better
weather weakened oats early. Buying by a I
prominent short at the decline, however, start- j
; ed an upturn, and the loss was more than re
| covered. May oats closed %(Â£ '4c higher. I
I Moderate selling by packers at the beginning 'â 
weakened ( provisions. The improvement in !
; grains caused enough covering to bring about
a recovery. May pork closed 15c higher; May
lard and ribs closed 5c hlpher.

which, if consummated, may result in even a
larger volume of trade next week. The feel
ing in the market is. on the whole, a hopeful
one, and there is an absence of that dejection
which was so noticeable a few weeks ago.

FARE ......,50Â«SMITH IS FAVORITE
OVER GEORGE GREEN
Jhe Welter-Weights Are Now in
Condition to Fight
f> KOROK GRKEN and TUHy Smith have turned their backs upon the-
b punching bags, swinging chibs and other paraphernalia used by pugi-
Ahen they are training for a boxing contest. Yesterday their re
ective trainers called a halt and ordered the fighters to rest at ease
until Friday evening, when they will be called upon to do battle in Wood-
Pavilion.
It la â¢ to the pugilists to say that whatever their training may
have been, their condition Is perfect. Smith looks even' inch a fighter, and
his numerous friends will be greatly disappointed should he fail tn stop his
opponent inside of twenty rounds. Green has very little to say about the mill.
"When pinion he smiled blandly and shooting a sly wink at his
-;.>r and r.->r.ndentiai adviser, Bob McArthur, said in undertones: "Well,
I don't know how it will end, hut I am .lust as confident of whipping Smith
=; I wns when I faced him two years ago in Carson. You must not
me now by the fight I made in New York, or you will get badly
I."
â¢-i Is v hard man to place. Sometimes he astonishes the sports by
Ms rapi.l and clever fighting; then again he will fight like an amateur who
I â¢art after a few hard smashes on the nose. Certainly, if Green put
up a good resistance against Smith for twenty-five rounds In ' New York
â¢he atmosphere was so oppressively hot that the spectators of the
a ere sweltering in their summer garments a great allowance must be
made for him, as he is unable to battle successfully in a warm climate.
c wants cold weather, and his fight in Carson proved that fact beyond
argur
Some wagers have been made in the poolrooms. Smith is a favorite at
$10 to $7. and as considerable "wise" money will be placed on him to
â â v < vening doubtless the above figures will undergo a change and the
.r may close at 2 t" 1. with Green on the short end. Judging from the
r he fighters, the betting should be at even money and take ynur
rr.nice, but the raco track sports are "sweet" on Smith, and their "hard
earned coin" will make Smith a strong favorite. The fight should, how
ever, be very exciting, as Smith is an aggressive fellow, and it can be safely
said that Green will not run away from hot exchanges. The preliminary to
the main event will be a ten-round contest between the heavy-weights Jim
Jeffords and Al Collins.
The managers of Green and Smith m^t last evening and after a very
brief session they agrteed upon Professor Walter Watson to referee the
fight on Friday evening. Watson consented to act in the capacity of ref
eree provided that he was granted the privilege of ordering extra rounds in
case he was unable to give a decision at the end of the twentieth round..
His request In this particular met with no opposition and he was then se
lected as the. referee. Smith at first wanted Jim McDonald, the .baseball
man, and Green's choice was Jack Kitchen of Oakland, but the lighters
could not agree on either man.

Interesting Developments Are Ex
pected During the Preliminary
Examination of the Ac
cused Detective.
Albert E. Lucas, the detective whose
apartments on Market street are illum
inated by various kaleidoscopic lights,
â¢was arrested and placed in a ceH in the
City Prison yesterday on a charge of
Bending threatening' letters with the in
tent to extort money. The complainant
was J. F. Turner of this city, and it was
on his affidavit that the warrant was is
pued by Judge Mogan and the alleged
offender taken into custody.

A famous woman in Chicago says: "I
am' so much in love with Grape-Nuts
;that I presume I often bore people tell-
ing them about the new food. You
< -rtainly will make an everlasting fort-
une from th? sale of Grape-Nuts. The
"article is destined to become the best-
known cereal on the market."
It can hardly be called a cereal, for It
Is not like the common rolled wheat or
rolled oats, but it is in the form of
granules, ranging from the size of a
pin head, up to twice or three times
that size.
r it is thoroughly cooked at the fac-
tory., and requires no preparation what-
ever, but can be served instantly with
hot milk or hot cream to make a hot
mush, or cold cream can be poured in
the side 'of the saucer and a very deli-
clnus crisp food is the result. Not only
is the taste fascinating, but the nutri-
tive value of the food i 8 very great as
shown by the improved- condition p'hy-
S C Si y dav d m , entally "* those who use
It.ten days of two weeks. j
issued sets forth that Lucas, with the
intent to extort from Turner the sum of
$19,315. sent to Turner two letters ex
pressing and adapted to Imply the threat
that unless the sum of money stated was
paid Lucas would accuse Turner of
crimeâ the character of the crime being
unknown to Turner.
The two letters referred, to were writ
ten by Lucas, a fact which he admits.
They relate to a certain transaction re
garding papers of the "Nobby" Clarke
estate, the circumstances of which, as set
forth by Turner, have been fully pub
lished in The Call. The fim letter, on
which complaint is made, is dated uarcb
â¢ , and was written by Lucas, in
which, after referring to a certain price
Turner demanded for blocks of- the
"Xobby" Clarke paper, Lucas complains
that he was taken advantage- of by Tur
ner as well as his friend. M. A. Rose,
and in conclusion says that Turner can
take the letter "as a threat or whatever
he chooses," but a settlement must l>e
had.
The second letter is on the same line
and again a demand that a "settlerm-nt
be made" is set forth. A few days ago
Turner filed suit in the Superior Court
charging Lucas with having entered into
a conspiracy to extort money from him
(Turner;, and the arrest of yesterday is
but another development in thin cape.
Others will follow, however, as Turner
proposes carrying the matter to the
United States courts and charging Lucas
with the improper use of the mails.
Late in the afternoon Luca-S secured 'his
release from prison. He denies that he
endeavored to extort money from Tur
ner, but says that the letters he wrote
wore simply sevtre. as the case demanded
such measures. He claims that Turner
is indebted to him to the extent of several
hundred dollars for services rendi
but on the other hand Turner sets forth
Lucas misappropriated several thou
sand dollars he paid him to be paid to
ward the settlement of an account be
tween Turner and Rose, but of which
Turner claims Rote never received one
cent.

finish Topmast, Myth and Tony Llcalze
finished in the order named. The winner
went to the post at odds of 16 to 5. The
favorite, Adolph Spreckels, made a poor
showing.
Track Notes.
Kitty Kelly cost W. L. Stanfield but
$275 at the Antrim stock farm sale, and
has already won two stakes and two
purse events.
After dismounting from Golden Rule
Bullman found that his shoulder gave him
so much trouble that he canceled all en
gagements, and will take a deserved rest.
Ed Corrigan added another horse to his
stable after the fourth event. On Monday
"Butch" Fisher "boosted" AdolphSpreck
els, and Corrigan retaliated by bidding
Potente from $200 up to $700, at which
figure Fisher let the horse go.
Limerick was undoubtedly best in the
two-year-old stake. While Golden Rule
was backing up at the finish Limerick
wafl closing like a cyclone, and in another
Jump would have secured the place. The
start gave tho race to Kitty Kelly.

BIG PURSES OFFERED
BY THE BREEDERS
ROSY INDTJCEMEIHTS OFFERED
TROTTING-HORSE MEN.
At a meeting of the board of directors
of the Pacific Coast Trottlng-Horse
Breeders' Association, held last Tuesday,
there were present D. E. Knight of
Marysville and A. B. Spreckels, B. P.
Heald, A. H. Cohen, J. C. Kirkpatrick
and T. J. Crowley of San Francisco. The
object of the meeting was to decide on a
list of purses to be offered for the race
meeting of the Breeders' Association
this year. A speed committee consisting
of Messrs. Kirkpatrick, Crowley and
Heald was appointed to prepare a list,
and as a result of their labor it was de
cided to give the following purses, to
close on May 1:
Horses to be named with entry (races mile
heats, three In five)â 2:4o class, trotting, $1000;
2:30 class, trottlne, $1000; 2:27 class, trotting,
$l(W0; 2:23 class, trotting, J1000; 2:80 class, pa. -
Ing, $1000; 2:25 class, pacing, $1000; 2:20 class,
pacing, $1000; 2:17 class, pacing, $11
Nomination purses, horses to be named Au
gust 1 (races mile heats, two in three)â 2:19
class, trotting, $1000; 2:13 cla^s. trotting, $1000;
free fcr all trotting, $1500; 2:15 class, pacing,
$1000; 2:12 class, pacing, $1000; free tor ail pac
ing, $1500.
Purses for coltsâ Two-year-old, trotting-, $2"0;
three-year-old, trotting (2:80 class), $300; two
year-old, pacing, $260; three-year-old, pacing,
$300.
The entrance to the purses In which
horses are named with the entry will be
5 per cent, and in the nomination purses
the entrance will be 3 per cent on May
1 and an additional 2 per cent on July 1.
and nominators in the latter have the
privilege of declaring out should their
horses go wrong before July 1 and only
be liable for the 3 per cent.
The purses offered are much larger
than have been given for several years
past. The fact that the appropriations
have been restored to the district agri
cultural associations and that all of them
will give fairs and race meetings this
year has encouraged the breeders to give
such large purses, believing that many
more horses will bo trained this year
than since the State aid was withdrawn
from the district associations.
In response to Inquiries sent out by the
secretary of the Breeders' Association
letters were received from the officers of
nearly all the district- associations
throughout the State ana in nearly every
instance they announced their intention
to give a fair and race meeting and to
offer liberal purses for harness horses.
There seems to be a general revival in
the interest taken in trotting races and
those Interested believe that this will bo
a prosperous year for the business.
The exact date and place of the breed
ers' meeting has not been decided, but
the meeting: will be hf>ld shortly after
the State Fair, and a date w!ll be selected
that will not conflict with the- dates of
any of the meetings on the main circuit,
and the meeting will probably be held
in San Francisco cr Oakland or some
other of the large cities in this part of
the State, where the biggest inducements
will be offered to the association. R. B.
Brown of Petalurr.a was elected to fill
the vacancy in the board of directors
made by the resignation of Joseph Cairn
Simpson.
Bishop SpaMing gives advice on
the education of women, in next
Sunday's Call.

ANNA MENTEL
WILL KNOW HER
FATE TO-DAY
Defense May Conclude
This Morning.
THE ACCUSED WILL TESTIFY
DEFENSE HAS AN IMPORTANT
SAN JOSE WITNESS.
Damaging Affidavit and Statement
Made by Mentel Prior to His
Taking the Girl as
Wife.
Oakland Office Pan Francl?co Call,
90S Broadway, April 5.
The fate of Anna Mentel, who shot her
â¢husband. William F. Mentel, In Alameda
on December 1 of last year, will proba
bly be determined by the jury to-morrow
afternoon.
The murder trial apparently possesses
but little of the quality of that morsel so
much soupM after by the ordinary court-,
room frequenu-r. Though both prosecu
tion and <:> I ably represented by !
6ome of tin 1 foremost attorneys, the trial
has been thun far absolutely devoid of
those nice technicalities, profuse objec
tions and spicy morsels <>t' sensational
testimony usually anticipated at such j
trials.
When the trial was resumed this morn
ing the accused, a mere girl, was accom- |
panied by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. I
Adolph Mentel, and a sister, and
throughout the tedious examination of
witnesses she Bat quietly by her attor
neys, \V. W. Foote, Guy C. Earl and
I^afe Pence, listening apparently indiffer- '
ent and hardly realizing the BerlousneÃÂ«
cf her crime.
During the day the prosecution put on
the witness-stand its remaining wit- i
nesses â John L. Ansel, brother-in-law of
the deceased; M. L. Glllogly, conductor
of the electric car Mrs. Mentel hailed
on that fateful night; Miss M. L.
Gueme, who watched over the accused j
girl while she was being attended to for
Eer self-inflicted injuriea by Dr. Lub- i
bock at his office; W. L. Smith, a passen- j
ger on the electric car; Dr. H. S. Buteau, !
who testified to the autopsy held on Men
tel, describing the bullet wound over the
left ear and flesh wound on Mentel's left
side; Arthur Jenkins, a student, who
helped the accused on a car; Henry T.
Morris, an Alameda Justice of the Peace,
â who arrived at the scene shortly after ,
the shooting; George W. Shreve, in front
of whose home in Alamerja the shooting
occurred, and James F. Fowler, Deputy !
Coroner at Alameda, who removed Men- i
tels remains to the Morgue.
Hut in the main the testimony was prac- |
tically a reiteration of that given at the
preliminary hearing. However, John An-
Fel madÂ© one contradiction. At the pre- \
llminary hearing he had stated that
Mentel was unmarried; now he testified
he was married. Jenkins was slightly
badgered by Attorney Foote, for the de
fense. He swore that he saw Montel lying
on the sidewalk, with one hand in his
pocket, so that the knuckles were not
exposed, while yesterday John Conrad
testified the knuckles were exposed.
At 3 o'clock the prosecution rested, and
Attorney Foote, on behalf of the defense, ;
announced that he would be ready to sub- j
mlt the cuse to the jury to-morrow. He j
â would have his instructions submitted
early in the forenoon, and consented to j
the instructions being given orally.
The defense then Introduced a certified
copy of the marriage license and affidavit
mad* by the deceased when he applied
at the Santa Clara County Clerk's office !
for the license; also the letter written b^
Mentel to Judge J. W. Glass of San Jose,
dated Alameda, November N. IS9S, wherein
he requested that "the marriage certl- j
ficate be mailed in a plain envelope as â 
conn as possible, as I may leave California
within four weeks."
When tli" trial is resumed to-morrow
at 9:80 o'clock Attorney Foote will make
a brief npr-ning statement to the Jury, and
co far as known but few witnesses will be
called by the defense.
The pita of tin- accused girl will be self
defense, and she will take the witness
Btand in her own behalf. T'non her testi
mony and that of .T. M. Shllue, Deputy
County Clerk at Scin Jose, the defense
banks great hopes. The latter is the one
before whom Mentel made his affidavit
end to whom Mentel had stated that he
wished the f:i<t of "his marriage kept
quiet for a while because he intended to
Fkip out." In this affidavit Mentel swears
that he and the girl were residents of San
Bafael. when as a matter of fact neither
ever lived there, and, moreover, he gave
Ills name as Manton.
The only real interest centered about
*|io dose of the trial is the fact that ex-
Congressman Lafe Pence, known as the
M silver-tongued orator of Colorado," will
use his argumentative abilities in behalf
of the girls acquittal before the Jury.
DOMESTIC POSES AS
NAPOLEON'S DAUGHTER
CJUEER STORY OF MRS. LOTTIE
JANE GOSSETT.
Committed to an Asylum Because She
Imagines She Is Heir to
Millions.
OAKLAND, April s.â Mrs. Lottie Jane
Gossett was committed to the Napa In
rar.e AFylum to-day. She la a domestic,
aged 3S years, and was divorced from her
husband several years ago. Her ex-hus
band is now in Wyoming and has custody
of their 17-year-old son, while her daugh
ter, of whom she had custody, Is attend
ing school In Portland, Or. " The unfor
tunate woman tells a remarkably story.
Mrs. Gossett says she is the aauphter
of one of th' 1 Napoleons and that as such
she is heir to $8,000,000; that she has been
trying since 1893 to raise money enough
to talte her to Paris to lay her claims
to the fortune, but she has been unable
to realize her transportation.
Ph^ says she met Victor Napoleon In
Chicago during the world's fair; that he
recognized her as his cousin and prom
ised to take her back with him. He told
her that his brother's wife had been ab
ducted from Paris and taken to this
country, where a child was born to her,
and he recognized Mrs. Gossett as that
child.
Mrs, Gossott came to Oakland recently,
and being without funds, found shelter
at the Chabot Homo. Miss Kellogg, of
that Institution, after listening, to her
Story, askwi the local police to arrest
the woman on suspicion of insanity.
THANKED THE JURORS.
Brandes' Attorney Expresses Gratl-
tude for the Recent Verdict.
OAKLAND, April 5.â There is now
Borne doubt In the minds of W. A.
Brandos' attorneys, Messrs. Sawyer and
Bennett, as to whether they will move
for a new trial, and apparently the at
torneya are now satisfied with the ver
dict brought in last Saturday finding
their flient guilty of murder In the sec
ond degree. At least such is the impres
sion conveyed in a communication re
ceived by each of the Jurors from Attor
ney Sawv'-r, which reads as follows:
â¢'SAN FRANCISCO, April 4. 1899. Dear
Bir: I am truly thankful to you for the
verdict that you grave our client in the
Brandes case and 1 take this pleasure to

not want you should think that we were
ungrateful In this matter. We were very
grateful to all the Jurors. Respectfully,

HIS REVENGE ON

Howard Arrested for
Perjury.
YELLOWTAIL IN DISPUTE
AN ARMY OF LAWYERS ON A
HORSE'S TRAIL.
The Australian Was Late and Found
a Warrant Waiting for Him
in Judge Quinn's
Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 5.
The record was broken In Alameda
County to-day, when a criminal case was
rushed to trial. The racetrack never put
up such a speedy contest as was wit
nessed In Judge Qulnn's court In the case
involving' the embezzlement of the horses
Yellowtall and Sam McKee-ver.
Fred Foster was charged with the fel
ony embezzlement of the horses, which
A. Howard, the "plunger," declared be

at least two continuances before such a
case could be started on Its way through
the court. To-day a continuance was the
last thing desired by the defense, and the
only thing desired by the prosecution.
When the case was called the District
Attorney could not find the complaining
witness, and asked a continuance. Judge

A SENSATIONAL STORY
OF A PROFFERED BRIBE
OAKLAND, April s.â There is to be a sensation in the case of A. Howard,
the horseman, charged with perjury. It is reported to-night that an
offer of $1000 in gold coin was made to Judge Frlek to throw down his
client, Fred Foster, who was arrested by Howard last Saturday for
embezzling two race horses.
Judge Frick was retained to defend Foster and secured his dismissal to
day. There was a determined effort made to recover the horses and to
prosecute the case, and on Saturday night Deputy District Attorney Harry
Melvin took a flying trip to Los Angeles to try and prevent the race horses
being taken out of the State.
It is said that a detective of the San Francisco Police Department took a
great interest in the case and offered Judge Frick a large sum of money to
stand in with Howard and throw Foster down. Frick Indignantly declined.
Judge Frick refused to discuss the matter to-night, but said that he shall
certainly prefer charges to-morrow with the Police Commissioners of San
Francisco against one of its best-known detectives.
sented Foster, stood on their statutory
rights and refused polntblank to grant ;
the delay even of an hour. The complatn
lUg witness, Howard, was absent, and the
people had not a single thing to present
except the reading of the warrant. Some
oneâ Just who cannot be discoveredâ told
Howard that the case would go over and j
: that he need not be present. Believing j
this. Howard was not In court.
: Judge Qulnn, anxious to oblige the pros
roution. did everything possible to keep j
the rase moving until Constable "U'eidler ,
; should find the complaining witness. In
: turn District Attorney Allen, his chic?
Deputy, Harry Melvin. J. J. Dunn and W.
W. Foote all consented to appear for the
, prosecution, but being unable to secure
a continuance withdrew from the case. G. j
Samuels, another deputy of the District ;
Attorney's office, was then sent for, as i
â  his superiors had to go to court to con- !
i duct a murder trial. Samuels secured a \
continuance for fifteen minutes to consult
with the witnesses for the prosecution,
only to find that there were none.
There being no evidence, the court dis
missed the charge against Foster. A few ;
minutes later Howard was brought in by
the deputy. He said that the horses which
i had been taken from Emeryville by Fos
ter were his,- as he had given Foster the ;
', money with which to purchase them. He
! had no proof of this statement, which was
: contradicted by Foster.
A J. Waterhouse testified that he had
pold the horse Yellowtail to Foster for
$10,000.
As soon as Howard left the witness
stand he was Berved with a warrant for '
! perjury, based upon his allegation In com
plaints which he had sworn to against
Foster. In the same breath Judge Quinn
released the $10.0<X) bonds in which How- |
:ird had had Foster held and demanded
$6000 bonds from Howard on Foster's !
charge. Howard was taken to the County
Jail, and sent out some friends to dig up
$5000.
Howard came from Australia some
months ago with all kinds of money. He
used it freely and was considered one of
the most agreeable things at the track. |
He declares that he was used so long as :
ihe could be drawn upon by a certain j
clique, and that now his horses have been
taken from him. while he is put in Jail. |
The sympathy of 'most of the horsemen
: at the" track Is with Howard.

EXTRAORDINARY GENEROSITY
TO MEET THE CITY DEFICIT
OAKLAND, April s.â The parents of the city government met to-night to
consider how the children's salaries could be reduced sufficiently to keep
the expenditures for the balance of the fiscal year within the capacity of
the treasury. An army of the city employes was present, and all made
very generous offers to refund one-quarter of their salaries for the balance
of the fiscal year. '
There was an organized opposition to reducing the salaries permanently
by ordinance, on account of the fact that thgpre is no guarantee that they will
be raised after June 80. Then, again, eaclr office must be declared vacant
before the salary can be raised, and advantage might be taken of this to sub
stitute other names than those of the incumbents.
Councilman Cuvelller proposed that the Councilmen return 25 per cent of
their salary, and this offer vpis unanimous. The MayoT had already signified
his willingness to return his pro rata to the treasury.
The feature of the evening was the speech of Manager Britton of the gas
company. "We learn from the Mayor," he said, "that It Is proposed to ask
us to agree to a change in the contract that will permit of a reduction of
$5743 50 during the next three months by cutting off a large percentage of
the lights. We are prepared to make this offer: We will keep up the present
system of lighting the city according to contract for the end of the year
and will accept $5743 less than the contract calls for. On Monday night we
will file a disclaimer to this amount under our contract, or, in other words,
we will present this amount to the city. We are prepared to go further. We
will, If you find your deficit Increase beyond present estimates, consent to
further reductions, but we will not reduce the street lighting from the con
tract schedule." This generous offer was loudly cheered.
Mayor Snow then said he had been informed by Mr. Dingee and Mr. Metcalf
that they would use their influence to induce the new board of directors,
after consolidation, to accept half the scheduled rates for supplying water
for street sprinkling.
There was a report in the lobby that the Lake Merritt Improvement
Club would raise a handsome sum to help the deficit, as Lake Merritt Is the
sole cause of the municipal stringency. During the past year about $75,000
has been spent or contracted for lake improvements, entirely as the result
of the club's solicitations. Nobody was present to represent the club.
When the Council came out of secret session it had decided to recom
mend fof passage all the ordinances and resolutions introduced with the
Mayor's message last Monday night and which have been already published.
The Ordinance and Judiciary Committee met immediately and referred
the Mayor's anti-gambling ordinance to the City Attorney, who will report
to the Council on legal points.
An ordnance will be passed after July 1 repealing the ordinance prohib
iting the Bale of cigarettes. Mr. cuvelller argued that it merely operated
to semi business to San Francisco.

MRS, FRISBIE'S
SECRET WILL
NOT BE TOLD
Died After a Visit to
Grand Jurors.
INMATE OF AN INFIRMARY

PAUPER'S GRAVE.
Friends of Former Years Will See
That Her Dying Request About
Her Sepulcher Is Car
ried Out.
Oakland OfT.ce San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, April 5.
The death of Mrs. Frlsbie at the County
Hospital a few days ago has closed a
Bee-ret which she partly confided to the
Grand Jury recently. Mrs. Frisbie has
been at the hospital some years and her
observations on certain matters were laid
before the jurors and were considered of.
such importance that some recommenda
tions based upon them will be Included
in the Grand Jury report. What Mrs.
Frisbie told will perhaps never be known,
on account of her death, because she
was to have returned at a later date and
completed her narrative.
Mrs. Frisbie was some years ago a
wealthy woman and, with her husband,
owned property valued at $30,000 In Ne
vada City. For fourteen years she was
housekeeper at Tony Oakes' celebrated
old resort at Haywards, which enjoyed a
State reputation. Thousands of "the old
boys" knew Mrs. Frisbie In Tony Oakes'
halcyon days and had many of her friends
known that she was an inmate of the hos
pital they would undoubtedly have come
to her rellf f.
It was supposed that Mrs. Frishie had
at least enough money left to carry o\it
her dying wish, which was that she be
interred alongside her relatives in San
Lorenzo Cemetery. Instead of this she
was buried in the potter's field and now
one of her friends intends to have the
body removed. But this cannot be done
until It has been buried one year.

President Scott Gives the Lie to
School Trustee C. L.
Tisdale.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, April 6.
The charges and counter-charges in con-
I nectlon with alleged corruption and "ring
| rule" in the Alameda School Department
| has developed into a beautiful fight
among the members of the Board of Edu
cation. President W. K. Scott and Di
rector Charles L. Tisdale. are the central
figures in the last phase of the fracas
j and are doing their best to exhaust their
| vocabularies hurling unpleasant and un
complimentary epithets at each other
1 Saturday night at a meeting of the
Non-Partisan party Dr. Tisdale grilled
his colleague on the board. To-day Mr.
Scott grave a prepared statement to the I
press defending himself from Tisdale's at
tacks and repaying the doctor for his on
slaught with the product of a rapid-firing
pen.
Mr. Scott explains that he accepted the i
presidency and agreed to appoint the |
members of the alleged ring chairmen of
the committees of their own selection,
only for the purpose of preserving har
mony in the board.
''Therefore, in view of the facts stated,"
writes Mr. Scott, "when Dr. Tisdale as
serts that I forced myself into the presi
dential chair to gratify my personal am
bition, I do not hesitate in branding such i
assertion as a premeditated, direct lie, |
for no one knows better than himself the i
circumstances of the case."
Mr. Scott avers that he has not pre
viously raised his voice against the opera
tions of the so-called ring-because he was i
afraid the San Francisco papers would
exploit the matter too fully. The gentle- >
man closes his tirade on his colleague in i
this fashion:
"In conclusion I will add that I have '
never attended a meeting of the board â !
the chairntan of the classification and
teachers' committee (Tisdale) being pres
entâbut that 1 experienced a strange feel
ing of disgust ana unrest, similar to that i
noted by many just previous to a thunder- \
storm. And I have never before met a I
person in whom are so strangely united
so many genuine, natural attainments
and qualities, with such a repellant com
binatlon of pugnacity, bombast, smart
ness and profanity, as are to be found in :
Dr. C. U Tisdale.'
HARVARD WANTS TO
PLAY CALIFORNIA
EASTERN FOOTBALL MEN MAY
COME WEST.
Prospects of a Big Match Between
the Two Universities After
Thanksgiving Week Is
Over.
BERKELEY, April s.â lt Is barely pos
sible that the University of California
football team may line up against Har
vard some time during the next football
season. S. L. Fuller, manager of the
Harvard team, is now in communication
with Football Manager Irving J. Munia
over the matter, and nothing but the ex
ceedingly great difficulty of sending the
California men East during the season
will prevent it. If it is possible for the
Harvard men to come West the match
will certainly be played.
A letter has been received, from Cam
bridge as follows:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 30.
Manager University of California Football
Team. Berkeley, Cat.â Dear Sir: Would it be
possible to arrange a football game between
Harvard and the University of California in
Cambridge this fall? I would like to play you
here on October 21 if you would consider favor
ably the project of coming East. I would like
to hear from you favorably in regard to this
matter, and also what proposition in regard
to guarantee you would consider fair. Yours
very truly, B. L. FULLER.
As far as going East is concerned Man
ager Muraa fears that such a course will
hardly be possible. The fact that Berke
ley does not begin her training season
tlfl September would make it out of the
question to have a team in proper shape
by the date named in the Harvard let
ter Even should that difficulty be over
come to send the California team away
In October would seriously cripple the
chances of the blue and gold in the next
big Thanksgiving game with Stanford.
To go after the big game would be too
late, as the California men could not re
turn in time for the close of the college
term. " . ,
Football Manager Muma will forward
these explanations to Harvard, at the
same time urging an alternative proposal
that the Harvard men come West. He
will try to arrange for a match some
time during the week following Thanks
giving. _____
BERKELEY FRESHMEN
DISRESPECTFUL IN CLASS
THEY STAMP TO ANNOY THE
PROFESSORS.
A Sensational Letter in the College
Daily Paper; Complains of the
Conduct of the Under
Classmen.
BERKELEY, April s.â The freshman
class of the University of California lias
been called to account for its behavior
toward its professors. It is said that in
stead of the respectful ( deferential atti
tude usually observed by students toward
instructors "and which ought to be borne
by the young disciples toward those who
lead them into the ways of knowledge,
they have behaved like bad grammar
school children. Impatient of restraint
ami ever ready to be annoying. To some
of the venerable heads of the depart
ments, whose gray hairs alone shfiuld
command respect, and whose lifelong r< -
searches and investigations into the
depths of their subjects unlit them to
Btand over their classes as pedagogues to
maintain discipline, they are charged with
having shown uncalled-for discourtesy
and disrespect, Nor has It been found
that a year's sojourn in the classic halls
of the 'university works any change in
this regard, but that, on tho contrary, a
turbulent spirit manifests itself as much
now as ever.
One of their own number, sorely grieved
at the conduct of his classmates, has
raised a warning voice. Like a prophet
of old he has risen in their midst to point
the finger of rebuke. He has told them
publicly just how they have been acting,
nor # does he shrink from calling them
rowdies and other hard names. lie com
plains that their rowdyism is not to be
classed as legitimate college fun; that il
Is exceedingly unbecoming to them as
gentlemen, and that they interfere with
the good and bright freshmen who are
anxious to make marks and get along.

IRISH ARRAIGNS THE
POLICY OF IMPERIALISM
CONDEMNS EXPANSION AND
POINTS OUT ITS EVILS.
His Lecture Listened to by a Throng
of Enthusiastic So
cialists.
Colonel John P. Irish last evening dis
coursed eloquently before a half thousand
members of the Socialist Society gathered
at the Turk-street Temple upon the evils
of the policy of territorial expansion. He
spoke interestingly for more than an
hour, and it was evident that he had his
hearers with him in his brilliant arraign
ment of the plan of procedure which it
was evident to many present that the
powers at Washington are applying in the
Indies and the Philippines.
Colonel Irish, however, began his lec
ture with a flat denial of the statement
that the Government had decided upon
eny such policy, nq matter how hard cer
tain interests attempted to make it ap
pear that it had. The Government bad
not. he Bald, nor could it inaugurate any
such policy except by action of Congress,
and this was his reason for the crusade
he ha* started here In the West against
it. It was his desire to show the people
what expansion really was that Congress
might be forced to act accordingly.
"All over this country." said Mr. Irish.
"men are arguing that expansion has
been one of the traditions of this country.
They say that from the narrow strip of
colonies on the Atlantic we have expand
ed until now our standard is unfurled on
the shores of both the mighty oceans.
"All this is true, but we have expanded
over contiguous territory and in one zone.
We have taken in no territory not con
tiguous territory, nor have we invaded a
zone in which it was not intended that a
native of the temperate zone should live.
If we inaugurate this policy we will be
defeated by nature itself, for the men of
this clime cannot exist under the rays of
a vertical sun, nor can they perpetuate
themselves beyond the second genera
tion."
Colonel Irish also said that he did not
consider that territorial expansion is pos
sible under the constitution. The consti
tution, he said, gives certain powers to the
President, but beyond these he could not

in railroad matters, and felt it necessary
to secure the advice and services of gen

look after his railroad interests. General
Huhbard and Thomas E. Stillman were
law partners at that time, and he se

partnership arrangement was entered into.

Stillman has been ailing: for the past
two years, and the cause of his physical â¢
condition is attributed by his friends to
the aggravation he was made to Buffer

He also said that never would this coun

labor were employed, and the day of slav

Frequent and hearty applause rewarded
Colonel Irish, and he was not permitted
to leave the hall until he had answered a
volley of questions fired at him from
every quarter.

proposition next Wednesday night.

WOULD RATHER DANCE THAN
WEAR A ROYAL CORONET
Fascinating .May
Jiengler Turns
Down a .Noble
Prince.
THE fetching, fascinating Hengler
sisters now dancing- their way
into the affections of the critical
Orpheum audiences are marvels in
many more ways than those which
strictly appertain to their graceful
art.
Both of the gifted young dancers
have been petted by Boclety and made
much of by royalty; both have been
applauded by the representative au
dlencea of J,ondon, Paris and Berlin;
both have forged their way, unaided.
save by the pluck and grit of a watch
ful mother and the force of their un
qualified talents, to the front rank in
their own peculiar line. May, the
elder, has refused, politely but firmly,
to wear the coronet of the royal Rus
sian house, and little Flora has
nodded "Nay, nay," to numberless
Johnnies who guarded the stage door.
In spite of all these dazzling atten
tions, both the Rirls are sweet and
Pimple -little Americans, free from the
afflicting taint of adulation, loyal to
their country and faithful to their art.
In the East the pretty sisters are
known as the favorites of fashionable
drawing-room entertainments, and in
the JGuropean capitals as the "trans
oceanic beauties." In New York the
name Hengler sisters invariably
brings to mind Commodore Gerry, and
every Gothamite is familiar with the
relentless warfare waged between
Gerry and the Henglers.
FLAMES DAMAGE THE
OLD POODLE DOG
CHINESE LAUNDRY AND A TAIL
ORING SHOP ALSO RUINED.
Fire last night wrecked the two-story
frame building at 322,. 324 and 326 Grant
avenue. The lower portion was occupied
by Wo Lee as a laundry and H. Zimmer
man's tailoring establishment. The upper
portion was a seven-room annex to the
Poodle Dog restaurant.
When the blaze .was first noticed at a
j Hales.
Mrs. Hengler told the story of how
Gerry forced her and her children
from their own State to seek more
congenial shorts and ultimately and
all unexpectedly to win fame and for
tune abroad. While the devoted
mother told the tale "the girls," as
she affectionately styles her gifted
daughters, listened closely, laughing
merrily a"s she recalled incidents of
difficulties surmounted and looking
tearful and serious as she- proudly
told of their triumphs. â¢'-â .
"The girl? danced at all the draw
ing-room entertainments of any note
in New York City," said Alre. Hen-
gler. "They were the main attraction
at parties given by Mrs. Grover
Cleveland . and had also the honor of
dancing at the lawn party given by
Mrs. Herman Oelrichs when her sister.
Miss Virginia Fair, now Mrs. W. K.
Vanderbilt, made her social debut.
They took part in all the affairs of the
Vaudeville Club, that was composed
exclusively of the very swell set.
Commodore Gerry usf <1 to see and en
joy them at all these entertainments.
but no amount of persuasion any of
our patrons could bring to bear could
make him consent to allow them to
appear in public.
"When May was 16 Gerry lost all
say over her, but she would not ap
pear without her sister Flora, who is
nearly three years her junior. 'If I
can't go on until Flora is 16, why. I
shall be an old woman,' said May, and
then I took the advice of friends and
went abroad with the girls. I had let
few minutes after 11 o'clock flames were
shooting from all parts of the rickety
wooden structure. The Chinese gathered
together such of their goods as they could
lay their hands on and carried them into
the street. There were but a half dozen
guests in the Poodle Dog. and these also
?f a ?.i a teS rried exit - followed by a bevy
or waiters. _
Just where and how the fire started is a
question of veracity between a Chinaman
and a Frenchman. Wo Lee says he first
observed the flames shooting out of the.
kitchen of the restaurant, and A. Gaud
ard, proprietor of the rotisserie, claims
the blaze started in the washhouse.
Shortly after the alarm was sounded one
of the; Chinese employed in the laundry
mads the statement that, a, lama had

ters to the best people in London and
also to the managers of th<=- Alhambra.
1 went to the manager with the girls.
They danreri. they conquered, and be
fore I knew what we were doing I had
signed them for a three month?' en
gagement. From London the girls
went to Paris, where they filled a
wonderfully successful engagement at
thp Folies Bergeres; then pn to Berlin,
Wiesbaden, Leipsic Geneva and then
bark again to London and Paris. '
The story of the adventures the
pretty American girls met with while
abroad are interesting in the extreme.
In Wiesbaden Prince Galitzin, of the
reigning house of Russia, fell a will
ing victim to the charms of the fas
cinating May. He followed her from
city to city and finally formally de
clared his passion and offered the be
witching dancer his heart, his home
and his coronet.
"Nay, nay!" said May.
"I'm a prince." argued Galitzin.
"I'm an American," retorted May,
"and a plain American gentleman is
going to be good enough for me."
Miss May, when she is not refusing
the offers of princes, gives her spare
time to the financial affairs of the
tirm in which she is one-half of the at
traction. She "books" herself and sis
ter, attends to the contracts and keeps
the books of the company. In a neat
ly ruled ledger every cent gained and
expended is carefully accounted for,
and the credit side of the balance
sheets shows $22,000, all earned by the
clever "girls."
