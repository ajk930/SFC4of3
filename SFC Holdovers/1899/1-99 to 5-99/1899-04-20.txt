can reach New York by means of it.
"My idea," he said to-day, "Is to get
up where the atmosphere is rarer and

of a metal tower. At the base of the
tower Is a Ruhmkorff coil sending a
current of from 2,000.000 to 5,000,000
volts to a Crookes tube to be placed at
the apex- of the tower. The tube would
be mounted on a pivot like a search
light so as to be turned in any direc
tion.
"Alongside the tower would stand a
mast or pole of equal height, capped
by a metal globe. A current of . low
voltage would be sent up this pole and
as the l.iprh voltage in which the cur
rent from the tower struck the globe
it would pick up and carry along the
weaker current. The latter would be
governed by telegraph or telephone in
struments.
"At the New York end of the route
would stand another 1000-foot mast or
pole surmounted by a metal globe, and
as the X-ray current from Chicago
reached it pulsations could he recorded
by a telegraph sounder or heard by a
telephone receiver." -

REVISION OF
DREYFUS CASE
TO BE REFUSED
Such a Decision Will Soon
Be Rendered by Court
of Cassation.
THERE IS FOREBODING
An Injustice That, It Is Predicted, !
May Cause the Downfall of
the French Republic.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DARIS, April 19.â The dcci
â  sion of the Court of Cassa
jtion, which will probably be de
livered on May 1. will be a re
| fusal of revision of the Dreyfus
I case.
This appalling news has spread
consternation among the friends
of justice in France, and has al
ready evoked manifold forebod
ings of the speedy downfall of the I
republic as the penalty for its re
newed defiance of the first princi
ples of truth and righteousness.
Shame, indeed, would be the in
evitable effect of persistence in
the suicidal policy advocated by !
the anti-Dreyfus Parisians.
It is universally known and ad
mitted in the light of evidence
taken by the Criminal < 'hamber
of the Court of Cassation:
First â That Dreyfus was con
demned on evidence secretly
communicated to his judges.
Second â That this evidence in
no way involved the accused
man.
Nobody is more cognisant of
the crucial facts than the forty
five Judges on the Supreme
bench. President Loubet. Pre-
mier Dupuy and other yiembers
of the Cabinet comprising the
Government of France.
Nevertheless, it is true that the :
Ministry is pressing the court to ;
render an immediate decision,
and the court has yielded to that
pressure, the understanding be
ing that the application for re- :
vision will be rejected.
Before civilization gives voice I
to its denunciation of the execu- I
tive. the Government and the
highest judicial tribunal of
France, there is an important
word to be said.
It might be possible that all
high posts of power in the
French republic are held by ;
knaves and cowards, but it is
hardly possible that they will all
be fools as well. Any Minister
or Judge who imagines it pos
sible to refuse justice to a man
whose illegal condemnation has
been proved, and in whose be
half the conscience of the civil
ized world is aroused, as never
before, would be the victim of a
delusion which no sane brain
could harbor.
There must therefore be some
other explanation for the incom
prehensible situation created by
to-day's news.
CLERGYMEN TO SELL
SERMONS AT AUCTION
Will Bid for the Privilege of Preach-
ing to Georgia State Prison
Convicts.
ATLANTA, April 19. -T'nder the new
convict system no provision has been
mado for chaplains. Refore the present
reforms were instituted it was the cus
tom to pay $3 per Sunday to ministers
for preaching sermons to convicts in
camps. Now the Attorney General has
decided it is illegal for thf State to make
the expenditure direct, and the only man
ner in whlfh th" convicts can be supplied
with religion is t.> set aside money from
the revenue gained l.v ttifir labors.
It has been suggested that, to prevent
complaints of partiality from the host of
country preacher* who want to minister
to the State charges, an auction be held
and the lowest .bidders h* awarded the
privilege of delivering a sermon once a
week.
I'nder the former system it cost the
Btnte over J.VHW a year to maintain chap
lains. The Prison Commissioners look for
ward with interest to the contest, and the
bidding is expected to be spirited.

EX-CONGRESSMAN
HILBORN DEAD
THE LATE SAMUEL G. HILBORN.
APPREHENSION AS
TO THE FATE OF
GILLMORE'S PARTY
Special r>f=patoh to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 10.âCon
siderable apprehension is felt
by Navy Department "fflcials
regarding the probable fate 1
of Lieutenant Gillmoro a nd |
party. While Admiral Dewey made no
mention of what steps had been insti
tuted to secure the release of the men,
if they are alive, it is confidently felt
that every effort is being exhausted not
only to learn the fate of the members
of the party, but, if alive, to rescue
them at once.
This morning's press dispatches from
Manila were shown â to naval officers
and were variously commented upon.
The impression seems to be stronger
than yesterday that perhaps they had
met with serious disaster. According
to these dispatches a steam launch
with a machine pun entered the river,
and later three valleys were heard* but
no response â¢ from the machine gun.
Some officers place, various. construc
tions upon this evidence, and one or two
officers expressed their opinion that
the Yorktown's party may -have been
suddenly surprised before there was an
opportunity to bring the machine gun
into play. In case they were captured
it is thought by several officials that
the Americana will be held as prison
ers, but still there Is a graver view
taken by others, especially in view of
the proclamation issued by the , rebel
leaders that no quarter be shown the
enemy, coupled with the rebel warning
that our army made no prisoners, but
killed all the captured.
Resting confident on the judgment of
Admiral De-.vey to make every possible
effort to learn, the fate of the York
towns party, no instructions have been
sent by the Navy Department and
none will be. Secretary Long stated
this morning that unquestionably light
draft gunboats had been ordered to the
assistance of the Yorktown. and it is
quite possible that a landing party had
been sent ashore to explore the" coun
try and discover what had become of
the launch and party. A vessel of the
Yorktown's size carries comparatively
few men, her crew consisting of not
over 160 at most. Her marine guard is
also small, so that Captain Sperry. her,
commander, would be incapable of
landing a sufficient force from his ship
for reconnoitering purposes without as
sistance from other vessels.
The Navy Department having re
quested a correction of the portions of
Admiral Dewey's dispatch of yesterday
which were not decipherable was to
day able to furnish the full text of
the dispatch, which is as follows:
MANILA. April 18.â Secretary of the
Navy, Washington: The Yorktown vis
itrrt Baler, on the east coast of Luzon,
P. 1., April 12, for the purpose of rescu
ing and bringing away the Spanish
forces, consisting of eighty soldiers,
three officers and two priests, which weie
surrounded by 4<iO insurgents. Some of
the Insurgents wore armed with Mauser
rifles, as reported by natives. Lieutenant
J. C. Gjllmore, while makins an examina
tion of the mouth of tb.e river in an
armed boat, was ambushed, fired upon
and captured. Fate unknown, as insur
gents refused to communicate afterward.

HOW GILLMORE'S PARTY
STRANGELY DISAPPEARED
MANILA, April 19, 4:30 p. m.â Ad-
I miral Dewey has been notified nf the
j strange disappearance of J. C. Gillmore
I and fourteen members of the crew of
Hi.- United States gunboat Yorktnwn.
On Saturday last the Yorktown
anchored oft Baler, on the east coast
of ihe island of Luzon and about 200
miles from here, where was a Spanish
garrison of about fifty men, which had
t n defending Itself against several
hundred Filipinos for months past.
Lieutenant (iillmore. Ensign W. H.
Standley and a boat"s crew were sent
i up tilt? river from- Baler Kay to com
municate with the Spaniards, the town
! of Baler being: situated some distance
; inland. Ensign Standley, who landed
at the mouth of the river, reports that
he heard three volleys, a bugle call and
cheers from up the river, but that the
automatic gun which was part of thf>
equipment of the boat was not heard
firing. Standley later paddled to the
Yorktown in a canoe. A search was
made for the Yorktown'p boat and her
crew, but n<> trace of th^m was found
and th>' Forktown sailed for II olio; from
j which place her commander reported to
Dewey his theories that the Filipinos
had captured or sunk the boat or that
the Spaniards had rescued the Ameri-
I can party.
Brigadier General Charles King, who
1 has been taken suddenly ill and who is
unable- to continue in command of his
, brigade, has beet] relieved of further
duty and htis been ordered to return
to the United States on the first, trans
port sailing from here for home.
ACTIVE HOSTILITIES
WILL BE CONTINUED
NEW YORK, April 19.â Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Notwithstanding the pres
ence of the hot season and the immi
nence of the rainy season in the Philip
pines,' there is to be no cessation of
active hostilities against the Filipinos.
This fact was developed at a conference
to-day between the President, Secretary
Alger, Secretary Long and Adjutant
General Corbin. It was also again de
cided not to issue a call for the 35,000
volunteers authorized by the army re
organization law.
It is the purpose of the administra
tion to send to Manila almost as many
regular regiments as there are .volun
teers to be returned. There are fifteen
volunteer regiments, which, according
to General Otis, will return home, com
mencing on .May 5. Six regular regi
ments are now on their way to Manila.
With' their departure only three in
fantry commands Will remain in the
country available for service in the
East. It is understood. that if condi
tions continue satisfactory in Cuba a
! couple of regiments of infantry will be
I drawn from that island and the

â¢ Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 19.
Ex-Congressman S. G. Hilborn died
at 1 o'clock this afternoon at the Gar
field Hospital. His wife and daughter
were with him. Judge Hilborn was
naturally a man of strong constitution
and until within the last few weeks
enjoyed the best of health. But for a
month or two he had not been feeling
as well as usual, and his physician at
tributed this to kidney tremble. Neither
he nor his family imagined it was any
thing more than a fum-tional disturb
ance, which would yield readily to
treatment, but his case Boon developed
alarming symptoms of diabetes.
The first indication nf his serious ill
ness occurred on Monday, April 10. He
had ordered a carriage to take him to
the Capitol and wag about to leave his
house when his right foot suddenly
gave way and he was thrown into a
state of collapse. A physician was im
mediately summoned and diagnosed his
case as blood poisoning. Later in the
day he made another effort to g,o to
the Capitol, but with the same result.
From that time he grew steadily worse.
Last Saturday he was removed to the
Garfield Hospital. He did not realize
that he was critically ill until yester
day, when he was asked to sign some
papers. But the depression caused by
a suspicion that his end might be near
was momentary only and he was soon
cheerful again. This was his condition
as he gradually passed into an uncon
scious state. Three or four days ago
his physician gave up all hope of sav
ing his life, as the process of uraemic
poisoning was inevitable and had al
ready induced gangrene in one of his
limbs.
Mr. Hilborn served for a while on the
District of Columbia Committee in the
House, but his best record was made
as a member of the Committee on
Naval Affairs. He was second in rank
on that committee in the last Congress
and devoted every energy and most un
tirins; attention to the arduous duties
i which Congress imposed. The furnish
ing of men and supplies to the navy to
carry on the war, providing new ships
for the navy and the reorganization of
the personnel by the committee caused
a great deal of work, of which Hilborn
was called upon to bear a large portion.
He was intensely interested in the
navy, an extensive reader of books
bearing upon different branches of con
struction and armament, and wrote a
lecture upon the new navy.
There is no doubt that his labors dur
ing the "war Congress" in behalf of the
service of which he was so proud,
hastened the break-down of his sys
tem. Mr. Hilborn was held in high es
teem by his colleagues in the House.
He was a companionable man and al
though he ranked among the senior
members in point of age, he numbered
his associates among all classes. He
had many warm friends on the Demo
rratic side of the chamber and was
universally liked.
The funeral will be held at the Con
gregational Church Friday afternoon.
One of the pallbearers will be Asso
ciate Judge McKenna. The body will
be deposited in a vault in Rock Creek
Cemetery and v.ill probably be interred
later in New York instead of California.
Mr. Hilborn has brothers and sisters
buried in New York, but Mrs. Hilborn
has not yet fully made up her mind as
to the last resting place.
OAKLAND, April 19.â The news of Me Hil
born'e death was a sorrowful surprise to his
large circle of friends in this county. He
was expected to arrive in Oakland in about a
week, and it was the intention of the Mer
chants' Exchange to tender him a banquet in
honor of the faithful work he has done for the
Third Congressional District during the past
ten years.
Mr. Hilborn came from Maine, where he
was born sixty-five years ago. His inclinations
were always toward the law, and after his
graduation from Tufts College he at once com
menced preparing for the legal profession.
When he fiiFt came to California, during the
civil war, he was admitted to practice and
for many years he made his home at the city
of Vallejo. His earliest political experience
was gained as a member of the Hoard of Edu
cation and City Trustees of Vaik-J... In I>O
he was elected a member of the Board of Su
pervisory of Solano County, but VÂ»->fore. the com
pletion of his term he was elected to the State
Senate. His first prominent work in the Leg
islature was in connection with the regulation
of railroad freight? and fare.-;, for at trcit time
the new constitution had not been launched
and freight rates were under the jurisdiction
of the .Legislature. Mr. Hilhorn fought the
railroad, but was beaten. In the constitutional
convention of ]S7S Mr Hilhorn was a delegate
and fought hard to prevent the adoption of
measures proposed by the Kearney faction, and.
failing in this, he attempted to oppose the
adoption of the constitution.
After leaving the State .Senate Mr. Hilborn
practiced law for a few years, and in LBB2
President Arthur appointed him I'nite.i -
District Attorney. He then chanced h;
in Francisco and three years later
moved to this city, which has been his h^me
ever since.
Oakland's first experience with Mr. Hilb^rn
In politics was in the city campaign of I^s9.
He was a delegate fmm the Seventh Ward to
the city convention. With his delegation he.
bolted the convention because he thought un
fairness had been practiced. The result of this
split was the election of John R. <;iascock. a
Democratic Mayor. A couple of years later
he assisted in organizing the Municipal I.,eagii.Â»
and held the ofilce of president until he was
elected to Congress In ]K'2. I'pon the reslc
natlon of Judge McKenna Mr. HHborn was
nomlnnted to nil the unexplred term and was
easily elected. For the long term he was ap
parently beaten by Warren R Knellsh. al
though the returns showed he had a plurality.
After a contest in Congress Mr. HHborn was
unseated, and all because of the disputed re
turns of Altamont, the smallest precinct in the
seven counties comprising the Third Congres
sional District.
In ISO 4 the battle of Altamont was fought
out again, and Mr. Rllborn was elected by a.
large majority over his old competitor.
Last year Mr. HHborn was agrain a candi
date, but It was thought by many that a
younger man should be sent f> Congress and he
was benten at the primaries by Victor H. M.t-
now Congressman from this district.
Mr. llllhnrn was married in VallÂ«\jo thirty
six yrars ago to Miss Lou Root, and his widow
and only child, Grace, were with him when he
died.

The first shot was fired in the alley
just north of Tulare street, between F

Ing of the battle and it .ably will
never be known just how it com

watchman, was at the corner of i ; and
Tulare streets when the first .shot was
fired. He rushed to the scene, and
upon reaching the alley saw two Chi

a third. â  Each of the men was armed
with a revolver and both were shoot -

them.
Farther up the alloy wore at loast
a dozen other Mongolians, all blazing

excited manner. As Rapelji ran up to
arrest the Chinese who wore shooting

HOAR'S VOICE RAISED
AGAINST EXPANSION
BOSTON, April 19.â The Sons of the
Revolution observed Patriots' day by
the unveiling of a tablet placed upon
the tomb In King's Chapel burying
grounds, which marks the resting place
of William Dawes, whose daring night
ride of April 18-19, 1779, was of the
same character and accomplish! I the
same purpose as the ride of Paul Re
vere. The ceremony was followed by
a banquet at the Hotel Vendorrie, at
which Senator Hoar and former United
States Minister to Spain, Hannis Tay
lor, were the principal speakers. Sena
tor Hoar said:
We should as soon have thought three
years ago of asking the Saviour of man
kind to conic down from the mount ami
take service under a Roman centurion
or go into the employ of Tiberius in order
not to be Isolated, as to have asked the
American people to descend from its lofty
height to engage in the diplomatic quar
rels, of Europe or the scuffles for empire
in Asia, Mr. President, I do not believe
for one, that the temper and character of
the American people have changed in a '
twelvemonth. I believe that the princi- !
ples of the constitution and the declara
tion, the doctrine on which the revolution ;
â¢was fought and won, are still dear to the
hearts of the American people.

BRYAN'S SECOND
DOLLAR DINNER
Talks to Workingmen of
N aw York.
il Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 19.â The second of
the "ono dollar" Bryan dinners that, un
der the auspices of the workingmen, was
held to-night at the Grand Central Pal
ace. The dinner was largely attended,
about 1500 men and women being pres
ent. Back of the speakers, painted on a
large canvas, was the following: "A sys
tem of political economy will yet dawn
which will perform as well a? promise;
which will rain the riches of nature into
the laps Df the starving poor."
Charlotte Perkins Stetson was one of
the speaki
in his bp< ech Colonel Bryan said:
Jefferson was a man of Ideas. We are apply
ing his ideas to-day to the questions which
ar:?e. They would not apply in his day. Thny
have not been applied since h;.s day. I thank
God that I live In a land where pence hath her
victories as well as war. i glory that we live
In a land where every day presents an oppor
tunity for man to show his love of country,
and 1 thank Gud that we live In this generation
where th:? grand .-i principles are presented
that have ever been presented to any generation
since the history of man began. A distinguish
c.l citizen of the nation Fpnke not long ago of
the strenuous life and applied his Idea to a
policy that gives this nation an opportunity
to, go forth with musket and carry its idea
by force to other nations. I thank God that
peace In this country gives an opportunity fvr
all the strenuous life of people. I: we but
begin to apply to our dally conditions the
principles which we all accept, theories which
we can not contradict, there is room enough
for work for several generations yet to come.
The declaration of Independence is condensed
Into a few sentences, the principles which
must ever underlie a form of government like
ours.
My attention was called yesterday to the lan
guage used l>y Abraham Lincoln in the eulogy
of the Declaration of Independence. This is an'
opinion of the present gathering, and 1 want
to contribute to the spirit of the occasion
by quoting what the great Republican said of
the work of the greatest Democrat.
I can turn to the words of Abraham Lincoln
and repeat them as a fit eulogy of the Declar
ation of Independence, because I cannot con
ceive of words that are more beautiful or more
true. He saidâ how wisely he guessedâ
the time might come when some man or party
or Interest might set up the doctrine that only
rich men or only white men or only Anglo-
Saxon white men are entitled to those privi
legesâthose blessings enumerated in this chart
of our liberty. And I read these sentences to
you to-night not that ,you shall be compelled
to accept the Declaration of Independence, but
that you may be compelled to. repudiate both
Lincoln and Jefferson when you leave the
Declaration of Independence. Jefferson carved
from the mountains of eternal truth the four
great pillars upon which the American Gov
ernment must rest. All men are created equal
âthat they are endowed with equal rights; that
governments are Instituted among men to Be
cure and to preserve those rights and the gov
ernments derive their Just powers from the
consent of the governed.
1 sometimes hear people complain because
husin<-<Â«s is disturbed by the agitation of public
questions. There is a war to escape It; let us
have a monarchy and then there will be no
disturbance of any kind of business; we can
simply serve and be happy. liut history has
shown that where one or a few think for all
the people and act for the people, they go in
jure all the people, and if we enjoy the rights
of life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness,
our life must be a constant warfare against
wrong. Jefferson never uttered a truer saying
that when he declared that confidence Is the
parent of despotism and that free government
exists in Jealousy and not in confidence. If
you elect a public servant and go to sleep, the
danger is that he may become more watchful
of his own Interests than of yours. The faults
of our Government are not in the people but
in those who misrepresent the virtue, the in
telligence and the wishes of the people.
BARTLET T&IPP STARTS

WASHINGTON. April 19.â Mr. Bartlet
Trijip, the Vnited States Samoan Com
missioner, left Washington at 10:55 a. m.
to-day for San Francisco, lie is accom
panied by Edward Morgan, his secretary.
Baron Siernberg followed at 3:30 o'clock
for Chicago. Before leaving, Baron
Sternberg had an extended conference
with the German Embassador, going over
all the principal points of the Samoan
issue as presented In the instructions.
Tho meetings here between the American,
British and German Commissioners,
while quite social and informal, have not
been productive of a very amicable set
tlemeni among all concerned. Since the
Commissioners are off, a sense of relief
pervades those diplomatic and official cir
cles which have borne the brunt of the
controversy up to this time. Their chief
anxiety now is to see the commission
away from San Francisco before tho.ro
can be any new turn in the events on the
islands.

COUNTERFEITERS
RUN TO EARTH
Secret Service Men Make
a Big Haul.
Special r>ispatrh to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 19.â Probably the
most important capture In the history of
the Secret Service was made yesterday
in Philadelphia by Chief John F. TVilkie
and his men when they arrested Arthur
Taylor and Baldwin S. Bredell, the mak
ers of the famous counterfeit "Monroe
head" $10U silver certilicate. These ar
rests were followed to-day by the cap
ture in Lancaster, I'a., of William M. Ja
cobs and William li. Kendig, prominent
cigar manufacturers, and James Burns,
who was in Jacobs' employ.
There were also captured the original
plate from which the silver certificates
were printed, a new hundred-dollar coun
terfeit plate and a new (50 plate, three
sets of plates for the printing of counter
feit revenue stamps, rolls, other para
phernalia, about five tons of paper and a
larse amount of counterfeit stamps. The
"Monroe head" plate and also the stamp
plates and the other materials were" found
in Lancaster, where the printing was
done. The plates for the new hundred
dollar note and the SCO note were found
in Philadelphia. The officials have taken
possession of the factories of the cigar
makers and have- attached their bank ac
count.
Taylor and Bredell, it is said, were cap
tured while actually at work on the new
plates. They are young men, who were
employed In Philadelphia by different
firms, but some time ago started in busi
ness for themselves. They arc said to be
expert engravers, and never before have
they been under suspicion. They are said
to have confessed to-day that less than
(10,000 cf the famous notes were put into
circulation.
The Bilver certificate, which was first
discovered a year ago last fail by an offi
cial of the sub-treasury at Philadelphia,
was probably the most dangerous coun
terfeit ever put into circulation, and
even the experts of the Government i'or
a long time were undecided as to whether
the note was genuine or counterfeit.
After a most careful search, however, a
distinguishing mark was discovered
which enabled the officials readily to dis
tinguish the genuine from the spurious.
Set-idai \ GagQ recognized the danger
of this new note and at once called in the
entire issue of many millions of dollars.
This prompt action balked the counter
feiters at the very beginning. uÂ£ the
hundred notes which were issued only
about twenty-six have been discovered.
Plans were set on foot to apprehend
the counterfeiters, and Mr. Wiikie, a
newspaper man of Chicago, who was
known to have done some very clever
detective work, was sent for and placed
in charge of the Secret Service bureau.
He immediately laid his plans, and on
February 1, 1888, found the clew which
resulted in yesterday's and to-da.y"s im
portant captures.
PHILADELPHIA, April 19.â A sensa
tional arrest was made in this city to
night in connection with the capture of
the counterfeiting gang. Harvey K.
Newitt, who was Assistant United States
Attorney in this city during the adminis
tration of President Harrison, was taken
into custody by secret service men on a
warrant sworn out by Chief Wiikie,
charging him with bribing Detective Mc-
Manus of the Philadelphia office. He was
given a private hearing before United
States Commissioner Edmunds and held
In 116,000 bail, which was furnished by a
wealthy friend. It was shown that at the
hearing on March 6 Newitt gave Mc-
Manua $500 as a bribe and on March 28
$500 more. This money was turned over
to Mr. "WHkie as soon as it was received.
According to the story told by one of the
officers, Kendlg of Lancaster suspected
early this year that he and his confed
erates were* being yratched by secret serv
ice men in Lancaster, lie came to this
city and engaged Newitt as a go-between
to bribe Officers Burns and McManus,
who were working on the case. Burns
was not approached, but Newitt saw Mc-
Manus and the latter agreed to accept
the bribe. All of the meetings between
Newitt and McManus were witnessed by
members of Mr. WilkJe's force, and the
evidence against him is said to be most
positive.
Newitt is well connected and has prac
ticed law here since retiring from tha
United States District Attorney's office.
He has also been prominent in politics
and was agreed on as the candidate of
the anti-administration faction of the Re
publican party in this city last year for
Receiver of Taxes. He had been put up in
the field by the factional opponents of
David Martin, who had captured the con
vention and nominated his brother-in-law,
"W J Roney, for the office. Before elec
tion day, however, a temporary truce was
patched up, and Newitt was withdrawn.
It is stated here to-night that enough
counterfeit stamps were captured by the
detectives in Lancaster to cover 440,000.000
cigars Ac near as can bo learned, about
$140 000 worth of bogus stamps have been
used on cigars thus far sent out from
Lancaster. ____________

BLACKMAILERS
Colossal Conspiracy in
New York.
Special nisi'atc-h to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 19.â A colossal
blackmail conspiracy has been dis
closed in this city. Seven prominent
millionaire citizens of this city have
been victims, it is said, and while Dis
trict Attorney Gardiner will Tint discuss
the conspiracy in detail he admits the
existence of the plot and that promi
nent men have been dupes of the con
spirators.
The plot includes the use of a camera
as an agent of blackmail, and it is said
one well-known philanthropist, fearful
of exposure, gave up more than JIOO.OW.
When the evidence is complete it will
be presented to the Grand Jury, though
every effort is being made to keep
secret the names of the men who have
suffered at the hands of the conspira
tors.
To Anthony Comstock and hi* agents
is due the credit of unearthing the plot.
One of the victims told of his >-\p<vi- ,
ence to the head of the Societj !â¢ i
Suppression of Vice and Comstock find
ing that the thing: promised big results
put all of his force at work upon it.
The results were startling, especially so
when the personality of some of the
victims became known.
The blackmailers were both men and
women. There were more women than
men concerned in th>: operations. They
hired handsome apartments, selected
and lighted solely with a view of get
tine a good focus for the camera,
which was skillfully concealed and
operated from an adjoining r
The victims were lured to the apart

The victims, when confronted with
these photos, have willingly paid to
have them destroyed.

better be dead and done with it than to be a

and especially to the woman whom he has
vowed to love, honor and protect.
The trouble with the average man is that
he has not the least conception of the
causes of ill-health or the right way to go
about remedying them. A little indigestion
or biliousness in themselves are not serious
complaints, but if negleted they may de-
velop into almost any disease in the medi-
cal books. Dr. Pierces Golden Medical
Discovery cures many serious diseases by
promptly removing the causes. It braces
up the weak and impaired stomach and
restores the appetite. It invigorates the
liver and all the secretory glands. It facili-
tates the flow of digestive juices. It makes
the assimilation of the life-giving elements
of the food absolutely perfect, and thus
enriches the blood. Disease germs are
scavengers, and will not enter healthy blood
or tissue. They must have the inert tis-
sues of disease upon which to feed. The
Golden Medical Discovery, " by enrichen-
ing the blood, tears down old and inert
tissues and builds up new and healthy
ones. It wards off consumption and cures,
bronchial and thToat affections which, if
neglected, lead up to consumption. All
medicine dealers sell the "Discovery."
" Eight years ago my husband coughed all the
time, writes Mrs. M. J. Tedder, of Ellington.
Reynolds Co., Mo. "Just as soon as he had fin-
ished a meal he would throw up. He was get-
ting- very weak. He took half a dozen bottles
of Dr. Pierces Golden Medical Discovery and

and stronger than ever before and weighs more.
Everyone said he had consumption."

the Excelsior In r97.
CHARLES SYLTERIG. blacksmith, of San
FranciÂ«oo, who was one of the Excelsiors, is
still at Circle City, bÂ»yond which point he did
not reach in '97.
JOHN T. FIELD is In Circle, too. He was
In the Excelsior crowd and did not get beyond
the city on the flats.
A. M. POPE of San Francisco left the Ex
celsior at St. Michael with the more eager of
that first crowd, forfeiting his up-river pas
sage with the A. C. Company's boat, to go with
the oppositiin company's boat that left earlier.
He got off at Manock, I believe. At any rate
he came to Dawson the following rpring but
did not remain, returning â .vn river and up
the llanook, where it is said he has struck a ;
good lead.
GEORGE F. BEMI?, watchmaker, of Fan
ger. Â«1.. Is at Circle, and has a very, neat â¢
little Jeweler's place on the front street, and j
has made himself very popular there, is sue- j
cessful, and refuses to be induced to come to '.
the greafr town. He started for Dawson
with i..c Excelsior Ii "57 and did actually
reach here, but on account of the scarcity of â 
provisions returned down th? river, stopped at
Circle and has apparently anchored there. lie j
ha? acquired a number of mining interests.
< WILLIAM A. RANK, formerly o: Oakland,
came Ii in the fall Of '?", representing Willis
Davis ar.d F. W. Van Sicklin and fathers, and
has made investments on Dominion and Sulphur
Creeks with more or less success. Rank Is
I housed and is in certain business relationship
; with Captain Hanson, manager for the Alaska
; Commercial Company. He was on the Excel
: si.ir.
i P. HEITZELIIAN of Los Angeles was one of
: the Excelsiors. He arrived up among the few
on the last boat in '97. He has been active in
looking for good interests, but has. perhaps,
been overcautious and net made much pro
gress in mining. He has made some money,
however, in other speculations, especially that
of the water front.
THOMAS McGOWAN. lawyer, who still has
I his office in the Parrott building, came In last i
j fall, and despite the proscription against :
i American lawyers, finds enough to do to keep
him very busy, and he is making money.
HOWARD TURNER, in charge of the A. C.
Company's post at Circle City, has just got !
in over the ice from the outside, looking a nd j
feeling in fine form. Mr. Turner was for- j
merly with Whitney & Co. of San Francisco.
He came in here In '35 and has had successful
charge of the Circle City post since that time. i
In coming In this time he left â  Skaguay Feb
-1 ruary 14 and made the run from I'-!ly River. I

but saw in that time, that he did not want to
stay.
HOWARD SUTHERLAND, formerly editor
of the News Letter, a San Francisco literary
fellow, has been mushing around over the creeks
a great deal this winter. He undertook prac
tical mining early in the season, but struck his
pick Into his foot and was so badly lamed that
he could do nothing more practical than write
verses and Klondike tales, a number, of which
writings have appeared in the local papers. He
has recovered from his hurt lons since, but
will probably go out in the spring. He lives in
a snug cabin on the hillside back of Dawson.
SUTHERLAND MURRAY has one of "Mo-
Donald's lays" on 4 above upper on Dominion,
in a good area.
BEN DAVIS started for Klondike In the first
rush of 1 37. He was frozen in at Circle and
almost became a fad in that then almost de
serted village, so well did he serve to drive
away the blues that beset the little colony of
ice-bound Klondikers wintering there. After
much debating with himself Ben at last decided
to at:-: . to* reach Dawson that winter. A
freighter contracted to carry bis outfit an! Ben
said good-by to the people, and nearly every
man, woman and childâ including the Siwashes
â came to see him off and lament his going.
There were a few who did not see the start
because they had kept the appointment so often
before that they refused longer to believe that
he would bo. But Ben started, and they
; 'watched him follow the dogs to 'the bend in
i the slough, where he was lost to sight. The
: next day he arrived back in Circle accompanied
â  by the freighter's dogs, as I remember it. The
'â  freighter had discovered that he had unrier
i taken too much and had thrown some of Ben's
! goods off in the snow, and lien by some subter
fuge got the man to return to town with him.
taking along his dogs. There he issued an
attachment, or something of the kind, seeking
to recover for broken contract. The trial that
shortly followed before United States Commis
sioner Crane will ever be remembered and
quoted in the history of Alaskan Jurisprudence.
Ben lost his suit, but maintained his popu
larity, and shortly after again set out for and
this time reached Dawson In good order. He is
i now serving as cashier for the Alaska Explora
tion Company, has made many friends here
and is doing well, having secured some mining
interests of value.
E. W. RINER of Oakland, formerly engaged
in business as sewer contractor In both San
Francisco and Oakland, came in this year. He
: had taken a look at the country twelve years
ago In company with Hank Banners, and had
â since kept himself posted. He Is active and

1 JAMES W. LOGAN, who was a reporter on
the San Francisco papers a year or so ago. is
now editing the Yukon Sun, owned by W. V.
mervUle & Co., lately from Australia. Logan
started In over the trail in the fall of 1537 with
I his wife. They were caught by the ice at Pelly
; River, and there Mrs. Logan's feet were BO
badly frozen that it was feared she would lose
them. She did not, however, but recovered so
entirely that after several months of suffering

with her husband. They arrived here about the

partner in the adventure turned back at the

job, but the summit, the last great struggle,
was stiil to be gained, and he declined it. Hart
continued on and finally reached Dawson after
many months of hardship. There are three
newspapers and printing shops in Dawson that
altogether employ on an average ten printers.
The census of the printers in town has not
been taken, but they are much too many for
the number of jobs, so that those depending on
them for their homestake have not a brilliant
prospect. Hart is a first-class printer and has
had his little share of the Income of the print
shops, but when the boats begin to ply upon
the Yukon again he will, he declares, t* among
the early up-river passengers.
W. H. SMITH, formerly with the Washington
Red Fine Lumber Company, San Francisco,
was engaged in the wood and logging business
here. He secured a grant of a large tract of
timber land, and. so the story goes, paid {1500
to the officials before he did so. Afterward the
officials made it unpleasant for him. charging
him with some small theft of a few cord 3of
wood, and he saw that ha must go. He went
to Eagle City and joined with Carruthers and
some others in a bier lan scheme which set the
miners against him. and at a meeting they
were ordered out of the country. Knowing of
Smith's unpopularity with the officials here
thÂ»y placed a patrol on the lower river, it is
said, and compelled the three men to come up
thiajway. Hr>re Smith was arrested and held in
prison for three weeks. The three after that
went out. on their way, they said, to Sitka
to secure the claim of which the Eagle City
miners had deprived them.

VIRGIL MOORE of Santa Rosa returned to
the country last fall, bringing with him his
wife. They live in a cozy cabin on the hillside
S and are enjoying; great expectations from cer
tain interests Mr. Moore holds on Skookum
Gulch and Toronto Creek. Moore was in here
last winter and went out among the last peo
ple to leave Dawson over the ice. He was in
terested with Charley Meadows and others in
the Klondike News scheme, the illustrated
â  paper published outsije, and containing, be
sides a quantity of descriptive matter of the
country and the mines, write-ups of mining
men and mining properties. The scheme was
I only in a measure successful, for Moore and
I Meadows were dftained on the outside until

Horses in Form.
STAMINA PROVES A MARVEL.
PAT MORRISSEY DISAPPOINTED
HIS FRIENDS.
Mary Black Won in a Gallop â Joe
Ullnian Did Likewise â Gusto
a Fast T-wo-Year-
Old.
Horses from the stable of Puke &
Wlshard took a very prominent part in
the festivities at Oakland track yester
day. The last three races on the card
fell to the Eastern lirtn, and only a poor
start prevented Catulus from capturing
the two-year-old scramble. Johnny ReiCt,
needless to say. piloted the different win- j
ners. Mary Black and Joe UUxnari were
pronounced favorites, but against Stam
ina 45-2 to 1 was laid. The preceding race
of this last named horse was a very bad ;
one. On April 4 the colt started In a mile
Belling run, finishing fifth, beaten over six
lengths In 1:42. The race was captured by
Wyoming, which was backed off the
boards, and Benaonela. Gauntlet and
Kami also led the Duke & Wishard
entry out. On that occasion his odds
opened at S to 5, receding to 11 to 5. In I
yesterday's event, with six pounds less
weight, the three-year-old stepped the
mile off in 1:40^; finishing out the mile
find a sixteenth in 1:47 ilat, easing up.
This is racing to form, as imported by
seme of our Eastern friends.
Favorites did not have such a gay time
of it during the afternoon, though" three
did manage to score at that. Yaruba
piloted by Glover and 25 to l in the ring.
was the star outsider to win.
Socialist, with Jenkins in the saddle,
ruled an even money choice for the open,
ing sprint, and woo without difficulty
from Brown Prince, a rank outsider.
George Miller came out of retirement and
extensively backed at odds of 2 to I ran
unplaced.
In the bustle and hurry to back Stromo
for the six-furlong selling sprint, Yaruba
was almost entirely overlooked. The big
gelding was always prominent and at the
wire finished over a length in front of
Festoso, als to 1 shot. Stromo was una
ble to get a call.
Tar HIM, with Piggott in the saddle
was looked on as the correct play for the
two-year-Old dash. The IIS pounds seemed
to have a depressing effect on the young
ster, for third was the best he could fin
ish. Jones on Gusto beat the barrier and
was never caught, beating out Catulus
the second choice. 5Â«-ss than two lengths."
Big thir.es were expected of Pat Mor
rissey. one of five starters in the seven
furlong mn. but he proved a bitter dis
appointment, running last. It was onlv~a
warming up gallop for the favorite, Mary
BiacK. which -â â â â¢â  in 1~7 flat
with much to spare. Guilder disposed* of
tn Â£! tlrtn JÂ« Kosormonde for the place
The nr.ie selling affair was just aÂ« easx
for Joe Lllman. The chestnut horse led
from the Jump, striking the wire two
lengths jr. advance of Potent
Carroll's mare. Daisy F. carried the
talent's coin at short odds In the final
mile ar.d a sixteenth run. and was badly
outfoote*!. Maraina made a romp of It
with Los Medanos finishing in second
place.

the big Da] establishment and â will later ,
take a hand in the Middle Western game.
Frank Taylor, the widely known and
popular trainer, departed for New York
last evening.
There is liable to be a lawsuit over the j
ownership of the horses Storm Klnsr and
Governor Sheehan. now in the possession
of anil being raced by X. Landsberg. :
Mike Daly, owner of Frohman and other
horses, states that he holds a bona tide
bill of sale for the horses named, made |
out in the name of S. D. Sullivan of Red
Bank. X. J.. and that the bill of sale in
the possession of Landsberg is not a valid
one. Daly has mgde over what Is pur
ported to be a nine bill of sale to
Miller & Blazes and the matter will prob
ably be fought out in the courts.
Frank Eckert cou!d not figure Stamina
and took four $100 bets on the Duke &
Wishard entry. Joe Rose was also hard
bit over the colt's win.
For a horse that was supposed to - have
been broken down over a year ago Joe
V ll man is a wonder. One day in the fall
of IsST. when racing in the Corrigan col
ors, he was started in with a lot of
"crabs ridden by Willie Martin. "Icicle
Bill" cot a strangle hold on him down the
stretch and he finished beyond the I
money. It was then stated that he had j
papier maehe legs, was raced in plaster !
of paris bandages and ail that sort of j
"kibosh." Some of these smart Western
ers must imagine that all their business
is transacted within thf confines of a bur
glar-proof safe and that everybody out I
this way is a "sucker."

IT DOES NOT SIGNIFY BECAUSE A MAN

his store every day. that he is in perfect health.
Men and women of sedentary habits are not
proof as:air>et disease any more than are per-
sons who lead more active lives. The man
who sits at his desk ail day lons is just as
likely to contract kidney disease as the man
who wields a hammer or drives a team.
Kidney disease corses on Insidiously, slowly
and surely, and. oftentimes. beforÂ« one is
aware cf it. It has established itself. Tou can
realize how essential it is to correct any weak-
ness of these important orpans (the kidneys)
when you take into consideration the important
duty the kidneys are called upon to perform.
These organs take from the blood the waste

Call SI.QQ.96i YearA VERDICT OF
DEATH PASSED
ON SEA LIONS
Jordan Says Thin the
Herds.
SEAL ROCKS ARE EXEMPT
RIVER FISHERMEN CLAMOR FOR
THEIR DESTRUCTION.
isands of Salmon Are Slaugh
tered and Nets Ruined by
the Savage Marine
Bulldogs.
The verdict of "guilty" has been pro
nounced in the case of sea lion, and there
is no doubt that the sentence of
death will h* passed soon by the State
Board of Fish and Game Commissioners.
This conclusion was reached yesterday
at a special meeting of that body, which
was attended by Professor David Starr
Jordan of Stanford. M. B. ScofWd of the
same institution, Dr. Harkness of the
Academy of Sciences and large delega
tions representing the tish canners. com
mission men and Tishenn^n of the hay
and rivers. Commissioner A!ex Vogel
sang stated that numerous complaints
had been made to the Commissioners of
the destructive propensities of the sea
".: as that infest the rookeries near the
bay. Nets of the fishermen are torn to
pieces, and salmon. Ivrring and other
fish destroyed by the tons by these ma
rine animals. The commission had been
urged to do something to reduce the herds
in "the Interest of the fisheries industry.
Total extermination la impossible, but ju
dicious reduction of the vast ami increas
ing numbers he believed would be ad
visable. Before proceeding to take such
a ster it was deemed advisable to se
cure the oj Inion of those interested.
ThÂ« first called uron to address the
meeting was Professor Jordan; who clev
erly prefaced his remarks by saying:
â¢"It" seems that I have been appointed at
torney for the ?ea lions, as they have no
other friend to represent them. We must
admit that some of our clients are guilty.
and no doubt deserve the extreme pen
alty. Others are not so giiilty and still
there arc maay which should" be placed
in confinement.'! The professor described
the four kinds of seals and sea lions of
this locality; ;.r.d for the spotted or har
'.. r seal; the treat gray seal and the fur
seal he pleaded "not guilty. " stating that
they â¢;â¢"> not frequent the bays or destroy
any amount of food fish.
For the brown barkinsr sea lion, which
:-; entirely different from the others, he
â 'V.' n0 d e ftns e to make. These are the
fellows that are to be seen at the Cliff
House, and while ho would not advocate
the destruction of any there, he said
thtre would \>e no uauger vi urivmg any
great number of thtm away. They are
the younger ones of the herd that "come
from the rookeries at the Farallones
and up and down the coast. All of these
ere males and are driven from the rook
eries by the more powerful members of
the tribe. Not one male in a hundred H
able to get Into the breeding-grounds
and if the ninety-nine fish-killers driven
out were to be destroyed it would not
diminish the increase in the least, but it
would save a large number of fish for
food. This class of sea animals is only
o: value attractions for the Cliff
H'-,i;se, and it is not profitable for oil or
"--'â¢â  caused me excite
ment by statin? that It would be a bene
fit to kill off all of the old bull seals that
could be found, a? there would still ue
too many males in the sea. Later on in
thp meeting, when he heard the expe
rience of the fishermen, the professor
said that the wonder Is that fishermen
had suffered so long and been so patient
w.:h the pest; v' V
Dr. Ilarkness indorsed all that Profes
sor Jordan had said and remarked that
the commission should discuss the best
method? ni thinning out the great herds
on the Faraltones and the rookeries at
Ano N'uevo and Point Reyes. He sug
gested that the best time to do this work
would be between May and the latter
rart of July, when the "pups" are young
and could b-? driven into the sea with the
old dams and drowned. It would take
too long to kill them with guns.
Nearly a dozes flshermeni canners and
packers spok* upon the great damage !
d"ne by the ?<=a lions In the hay and
up the rivers. To sura up the evidence
ajralnst these creature?, they destroy nets
that cost from J3W to %Â¥*) as easily as '
the paddle of a steamboat. They kill |
great quantities of salmon, only taking a
bite out of the belly nf each" fish and
leaving the rest for the sea gulls that fol
low in their wake. The salmon run Is fol- â 
lowed eyery time by sea lions, and as far j
as car. be learned out of every ten fish |
that enter the nets the pea'lions get I
ei?ht. One of the speakers in the pack- !
ing. business said if the -'rovers of I
salmon were decreased there would be j
more canneries start upon the river Such '
the testimony of F. H. Booth. Jo
seph Catania; Al Wiison. B. Morisino, J.
E. Benjamin. J. B. Ineuglia. B. Vergllio
and several others. Petitions from over '
.'â â¢"â  river fishermen for the destruction ol
the sea lions were read. When asked as
to the means, in a money way. at t be dis- j
r<"?a! of the commission to carry on the j
work of thinning out the herds. Commis- |
sioner Gould said that there would be I
plenty of assistance from those inter- I
c.-ted. Commissioner Vogelsang said that â¢
the body would further consider the mat
ter before proceeding with the project
under discussion.

THE SAN FRAXCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 20, 1899.
three representatives who are chosen
at the annual diocesan convention for
the purpose of governing and direct
ing the management of the hospital.
The proposed extension of Twenty
seventh street through the hospital
would destroy the principal buildings,
as can b<Â» seen, inasmuch as they
stand on the direct line of the street,
if extended to Valencia. One build
~at which was erected by D. O.
Mills as a gift, cost $10,060.
This and the other structures, if re
moved, would monopolize all the
available ground upon which build
ings could be placed. The. result
would be to cause the removal of the
hospital as an entirety from its pres
ent location. This movement will be
fought by the directors, who in this
case represent the entire Episcopal
church community. The board of di
rectors are, however, in favor of im
provements, and will co-operate with
the Mission progressionists in hav
ing Duncan street cut through and
will gladly pay their share of the ex
pense for so doing. This, it is claimed
by the directors, will answer the pur
pose of giving the advocates of the
extension all that could be obtained
if Twenty-seventh street should be ex
tended as proposed.
Another plea set forth by the di
rectors is the convenience of the hos
pital to the center of the city by its
easy access with so many cars pass

pital books shows that 1500 free cases
were attended last year by the house
surgeons, not to mention those who
applied to the visiting physicians at
their private off.. -

JOSEPH CLARK FOUND
GUILTY OF MURDER
HIS PUNISHMENT FIXED AT
LIFE IMPRISONMENT.
The Attorneys for the Defense Sub
mitted Their Case Without
Argumentâ His Crime.
After deliberating for four hours, last
evening thi the Joseph nark case
returned a verdict of murder in the first
degree and fixed the penalty at life im
prisonment.
At the oponinc of the morning session
-â lay Assistant District Attorney
Graney heg-an his argument. He analyzed
the evidence at length, hut left the final
touches to District Attorney Murphy.
Immediately after he concluded his ad
dress, to the surprise of every one in thrs
courtroom. H. Dighy Johnston, who with
Louis P. Boardman represented th<> de
fendant, arnse and stated that thÂ» de
fense would submit its case without argu
ment. This unexpected move harreÂ«i Dis
trict Attorney Murphy from making his
argument, and. judging from the row of
books he had caused to be brought into
the courtroom, the sudden termination of
the ca?e disappointed him.
Judge Dunn then charged the jury, and
it retired to deliberate on a verdict.
Shortly after 4 o'clock word was sent In
that the jury could agree on a verdict,
but not before S o'clock in the evening, so
the crowd filed out to return at the hour
mentioned. Another wait was in store
for It. as the jury was not ready for some
time later.
-k was tried for the killing of Fire
man Joseph P. Gross in November last.
Peter McGlade's Trial.
The trial of Peter HcGlade, charged
with having forged warrants upon the city
treasury while employed in the office of
the Superintendent of Streets, was post
poned yesterday morning for one we-k.
The continuance was asked by Assistant
District Attorney Black on the ground
that one of the witnesses' for the prosecu
tion. Handwriting Expert Theodore
Kytka, was in Willows as a witness in
the famous Murdock note case.

AUDITOR FINDS A WAY OUT
EXPEDIENCY MORE POTENT
THAN THE LAW.
City Officials Confer and Deciie That
the Statute Should Not Be Too
Strictly Construed.
Auditor Wells will stand between the
patients at the City and County Hospital
and starvation. This was d<
terday after a conference between the
Auditor and the Finance Committee of
the Board of Supervisors.
The amount of money available for the
maintenance of the hit for fne
present fiscal year is $3000. Some time
ago it became apparent that there would
be a deficit in the hospital fund ;
the Ist of July unless retrenchment were
inaugurated by the Board of Supervisors.
This was not done, and at I
March Auditor Wells found that th<
mands presented for that month exceed
ed the monthly apportionment
$3000. Bills to this amount were
up." it being the intention of the A .
to pay them out of the April appoi
ment.
A few days ago it became apparent
that the b - for April v
the apportionment for this month
that either the Mar. i April bills
:n excess of the appropriati
have to suffer. \Yh*-n this \
tamed the merchants rebi â  â¢ ex
perience having taught tnem that there
was small pr spect of obtaining
money under the circumstances. To meet
â  mergency the Board of S
at its meeting last Monday i reso
lution transferring t the maintenance
fund of the hospital the sum of $8000 re
maining in the appropriation for repairs
to that institution. This . was
transmitted to Auditor Wei - -a no in
turn submitted the question of the legal
ity of the act <â¢!" the board to his legal
advisor, General Dickinson.
The attorney submitted an opinion to
the Audit r in whl< h it was hi lo that the
act of the board was illegal and that it
had no power under the pi i of the
consolidation act to transfer money from
one fund to another. Acting on thii
vice, the Auditor notified the merchants
that he would refus- i | tnands
against th>- $8000 ad
â¢ fund. The i - in turn
served notice that tl
supply the - ' with fuel and
visions until their demands for bai k pay
had been satis: I
Yesterday the Finance Committee of
the Board of Supervisors held a confer
ence with Auditor Wells for the purpose
of discussing the situation and finding,
if possible, some way out of the diffi
culty. General Dickinson was called in,
and it was finally decided that the Au
ditor should, on the score of expediency,
accept the $8000 as a part of the mainte
nance fund of the hospital and audit de
mands against it.
"There is a very grave doubt about the
legality of such a course." said the Au
ditor later in the day. "but the situa
tion with which we are confronted is a
critical one and I do not feel Inclined to
make the unfortunates who are confined
at the City and County Hospital suffer
because of a too strict interpretation of
the law. This being so, I have deemed
it advisable, in the interests of human
ity, to close my eyes to technicalities in
this particular case and use such money
as is at hand for the - payment of the
hospital provision bills in order that the
patients may not be made to suffer. I
have so notified the Board of Super
visors."

PERQUISITES OF
ASSESSOR DODGE
ARE CUT SHORT
Federal Employes and
Polltax.
Assessor Dodge has received a setback
in his announced purpose of collecting
poll tax from every man within the. city
and county who is liable to the tax under
the law. He has been inrormed by the
City and County Attorney that he cannot
arbitrarily collect poll tax from Federal
employes by levying upon their salaries.
Inasmuch as the Assessor puts into his
own private purse 30 cents out of each $2
tleman who rejoices in the prepos
sessing appearance Induced by a for
midable pair of Dundrearys. Has
tings objected to these playthings of
.the wind, objected to the venerable
age of the character and declared in
round, emphatic terms that he would
not play, and if he did. why his
connection -with the Alcazar would be
a matter of ancient history.
The managers thought he was jest
ing and let the play go on. The actor,
however, was in dead earnest, and
no amount of managerial persuasion
has availed. Some Eastern man will
probably -be brought out here to take
Hastings' place, and Hastings, who
has already received many Eastern
offers, is inquiring if "old man" parts
go with the contract before deciding
which he will finally accept.
I collected for poll tax, he now finds himself
cut off from the enjoyment of a consider
able revenue that would otherwise have
been his.
The City and County Attorney's opinion
is set down in the following communica
tion received by the Assessor yesterday:
i SAX FRANCISCO, April 13. 1539.
Hon. Washington Dodge. Assessorâ Dear Sir:
In your communication of the 17th lnst. you
inquire "if the Assessor can avail himself of
the procedure laid down In sections 3S4S and
2549 of the Political Code in the collection of
poll tax from the employes of the Federal Gov
ernment, such as laborers at the Presidio and
letter carriers In the Pnstoffice Department.
Section 3S4S reads: '/Every person indebted
to one who neglects or refuses, after demand,
to pay .1 poll tax becomes liable therefor, and
must pay the same for such other person after
service upon him by the collector of a notice '
In writing, stating name of such person "
Section 3549 reads: "Every officer authorized I
to draw the warrants for or to pay the salary
or fees r>f any officer Is the debtor of such
officer within the meaning of the preceding
section." i
The State has no power to direct the action
of Federal officials, nor can it legislate the
Federal Government lrito its debt It is there
for" impossible for the State to hold Federal
officials Hal for the <IÂ»hts r.t r.ther employes
of the United States Government. ThÂ» sec
tions of the Pclitk-ai Code quoted above do not
ajjply in such cases. Respectfully.
FRANKLIN K. LANE.
Attorney and Counselor.
Much criticism has been caused by As- I
sessor Dodge's arbitrary decision in the
matter of collecting poll tax from every
employe of the city by causing the
amount of the tax to be deducted from !
the salary warrants. This criticism is
particularly bitter because of the fact
that â  -â¢â¢ law allows the Assessor to retain
Â»i cents out of each $2 collected. It fol
lows-ihat the Assessor is personally bene
fited financially by a rigid enforcement of |
the law, and there are those, who are un
kind enough to assert that his zeal in
enforcing the law in the matter of the col
lection of the poll tax is due to his desire
to swell his private bank account.
In this connection several ugly stories.
some of them weil authenticated, are
afloat relative to the manner in
which the Assessor's deputies wring
the -?. tax out of the ignorant, the poor
or the unsuspecting persons whom they
pounce upon. Recently >>:-.â¢ of Dodge's
deputies "held up" a Chinese servant of
one of the head officials of the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railway. The
servant had been sent to the ferry with
a package which ]-.â¢ was instructed to
ship to his employer's home in Marin
County. Tho package was plainly marked
and addressed. Arrived at the ferry the
Chinese fell into the clutches of one of the
Assessor's deputies, who demanded that
he forthwith pay over $2 for poll tax. The
Chinese protested, whereupon the deputy
forced him against the wall of the waiting
room and searched him. j Not finding any
money in the servant's pockets the dep
uty seized the package and made off with
it in spite of the protest made by the
Chinese and the too evident fact that the
package belonged to another.
The official whose property had he^n
confiscarcd in this high-handed manner
indited a scorching letter to . the Asses
sor and recovered his package. The dep
uty who -committed this outrage is still in
the employ of the Assessor and is still
hard at work collecting poll tax.
Other and similar Instances where citi
zens have been Insulted by these tax coi
lectors are numerous and much com
plaint is beinp made as to the character
of the men whn have been employed by
Mr. Docile to perform the work. * Some
of his deputies are ex-policemen, who
were discharged from the Police Depart
ment for cause. Others are roughs or
pothouse politicians, who have no respect
or reerard for the rights of citizens. Many
of the Assessor's deputies are pood men,
who deplore the acts of their associates
for the reason that they feel they must
bear a share of the reproach that such
acts of rowdyism entail upon the entire
office force.

ThjE PHILIPPINE SITUATION.

mediate question to be determined is whether our

the Philippines to actual occupation. This
n has a twofold aspect, one bearing on the
; a policy of conquest on our own internal con
. and the other, without considering the con
i, involving policy or expediency.

new thing for American citizens to witness the
growth of militarism and the reproduction on their
own soil of the scenes that preceded the imperiah-r.i
of the Caesars. It is a strange and mournful expe
rience for them to hear from the lips of an American
gendtal that one-half of the Tagals should be killed
in order that the other half may be civilized.
But this phase of the issue need not be further
at the present time. The remaining question
it" one of expediency. It is extremely doubtful
whether potential occupation of the Philippines can
he secured even by an army of a hundred thousand
men. The statistics and information as to the Phil
ippines are very meager. The interiors of several of
the larger islands have never been surveyed. There
5, especially in Mindanao, six hundred
miles or thereabouts southeast of Luzon, that have
i their independence. The number of the
is-lands has not been definitely ascertained, but the
estimates vary from twelve to fourteen hundred. It is
said that at least thirty different languages are spoken
by the inhabitants. The Tagals, who are thoroughly
fearless and intractable, had an alphabet and a rude
r Q of their own before the archipelago was
discovered.
Such facts as these, coupled with the experiences
of the past few months, bring home to the country
the magnitude of the task which the reduction of the
Philippines to an American province would entail.
Considerations of good faith and of integrity cannot
be ignored. The United States occupies the foremost
position among modern nations. It commenced the
war with Spain by issuing sentimental declarations
that even the hypocritical assumption of exigencies
providentially developed cannot erase. Its greatness
is due to its constitutional and historical past, the
farthest remove from conquest and imperialism of
which the human mind can conceive. It bears "the
white man's burden" for its own citizens, for the
throbbing and expectant masses of Caucasian human
ity everywhere. It stands upon its record, unre
proached, triumphant, and filled with the glory of a
sacred trust.
It is quite possible, without a trace of fear or hesi
tation, but in the exercise of what may be termed
national manhood and national consistency, for the
Government to place the Philippines in an indepen
dent situation, conformable to our own Declaration
of Independence, to exact as its sole condition for
it? adherence to principle and to honor the return
of its necessary expenditures, including the twenty
millions to be paid to Spain, and to establish, for its
own security and to safeguard a native administration,
a temporary protectorate.
The whole matter is in the hands of President Mc-
Kinley and his Cabinet, influenced, as they properly
may be, by the evidences of public sentiment, frre
spective of party, that will certainly reach them. We
entertain a reasonable confidence that the crisis will
be temperately considered and a conclusion reached
that will preserve the integrity of our political insti
tutions and command the respect of the American
people and of all civilized nations.
It is said that Governor Gage, in the serious task of
assigning State patronage, is carefully separating the
sheep from the goats in the Republican fold. His Ex
cellency certainly ought to be an authority on the
sheep.
It has been fully two weeks since Embassador
Choate'was at a public banquet in London, and it will

GOVERNMENT IN BUSINESS.
THE Examiner, in editorial explanation of its
plan for putting all the business of the country
in the hands of the Government, says:
"The plan proposed is that the Government shall
rystematically set aside every year a certain surplus
revenue from taxation to be applied to the purchase
of productive properties, and that all the profits from
the possessions so acquired shall be reinvested in
similar properties. * * * The feature of this plan
that will especially commend it to a sober, hard
headed people like the Americans is its absolute
freedom from risk. * * * The Government would
start out of debt, stay out of debt and become richer
and more important every year."
Sober-minded and hard-headed people will be apt
to inquire why the business of the country, which now
consists in the ownership and operation by individuals
of productive property, real and personal, will be
come free from risk when the same productive prop
erties are owned and operated by the Government.
At present there is a large percentage of failures in
the operation of these same productive properties by
individuals and corporations. It is estimated that the
looses by risk in such properties ensuing upon the
panic of 189.3 amounted to ten billions of dollars.
Those losses fell, directly or indirectly, upon indi
viduals. Does the Examiner mean that if such loss
fall upon the Government it will avoid the conse
quences of business risk by increasing taxation to
make itself whole? In no other way can Govern
ment recoup itself. It will make no difference to the
people how this increased taxation may be levied,
whether by increasing the cost of using the facilities
and utilities belonging to the Government or by put
ting in motion the ordinary machinery for taxation.
Jefferson did not believe in the Government em
barking in business. He thought the Government
should be confined to the exercise of police powers
and the control of means of defense, leaving business
to the people. What is meant by the phrase, "The
Government would become richer and more impor
tant every year?"
In 1 what way would that serve the interests of the
people? What effect upon popular freedom and the
rights of man would follow an increase in the wealth
and importance of the Government? The phrase
means a Government, through its ownership of all
business and productive property, becoming stronger
and more independent o^f the people every year.
\\ hen have strong Governments, in that sense, been
associated with a strong people? Under our system
it is intended that the people shall take care of the
Government, not that the Government shall take care
of the people.
Heretofore the people have had the privilege of
saying, through their representatives, how much tax
they will pay for the support of the Government. For
twenty-one years, ending June 30, 1898, the tax so
paid for the support of the Federal Government had
averaged five dollars per capita per annum. During
all that period the total average contribution of each
citizen to the Government was $105. In place of that
taxation the Examiner would substitute all that a
citizen pays out for use of the telegraph, telephone,
street cars, steam and water transportation of freight
and passengers, for fire, food and clothing, and all
of the necessaries of life, for these are furnished by
the "productive properties" which the Government is
to own and operate with "freedom from risk."
The expenditures of the citizen constitute the flow,
the circulation, of money. The citizen in business de
votes the profits of his business to the purchase of
what lie needs, as the laborer devotes his wages. But
the Government is an impersonality. When it sells
a ton of coal to a dairyman it will not go to the
corner store and invest the proceeds or the profits
in butter, for it needs no bread. The officers of the
Government will eat, drink and wear, but they do that
now. The only use to be made by the Government of
its profits,.' according to the Examiner, is "reinvest
ment in productive properties." not in the consumable
properties which form the necessaries of life.
Private expenditures, even in luxuries of equipment,
for objects of art and the pleasures of dress and diet,
restore money to its proper channels, where it is in
reach of the individual again. In this way even the
extravagance of the private individual in a large sense
and a large measure benefits the masses of the people.
But public extravagance on the part of the Govern
ment reduce* revenues, which have to be replaced by
resorting to increase in some form of taxation which
the people must endure. The owner of a private for
tune may fill a picture-gallery, adorn his person or
increase the state and circumstance of his existence
without adding a penny to another's cost of living.
But any similar indulgence by the Government must
come by reducing the comforts of the people through
an increase in their coÂ«t.
The Examiner quotes the Government ownership
and operation of German railways as an example in
proof of the feasibility of its plan. If the German
railways were run at the rates and paid the wages of
American railways they would pay no profit at all.
It is plain, therefore, that the Government profit in
operating German railroads is taken from two
sources, the wages of labor and excessive charges on
freight and travel.
There is no ground for doubting that our Govern
ment would get any profit at all out of its operation
of the business of the country in precisely the same
way. It would require the "importance" hoped for
and the consequent strength and centralization of
power to enable it to transfer its losses to the people,
to its hired men and customers.
There is another point of view from which the
proposition is to be considered, and that is the effect
upon the people of withdrawing the incentive to in
dividual accumulation.
CLEAR THE GROUND IN ADVANCE.
THE Supervisors have consulted the best interests
of all concerned in postponing the special elec
tion at which it was proposed to submit the
question of issuing bonds for extending the pan
handle of Golden Gate Park to Van Ness avenue and
for building additional schoolhouses, providing an
adequate sewer system and reconstructing the ac
cepted streets.
The panhandle project is one which is bound to
elicit a great deal of discussion, since it is the only one
among those proposed to be submitted concerning
which there is any difference of opinion. No one
doubts that the necessity of an adequate sewer sys
tem, reconstructed accepted streets and new school
houses is the most imperative of any that confronts
the municipal authorities. Moreover, there is no
question of the power of the Supervisors to make an
appropriation for schoolhouses, sewers and streets.
Tlie law as it stands gives them ample authority to
inaugurate any work they may consider advisable in
these lines of improvement.
But regarding the panhandle a verj* serious ques
tion exists with reference to the city's power, and be
fore an election is ordered the Supervisors should take
Â«j?ins to thoroughly understand it. The act of 1887,
under which it is proposed to submit the question of
issuing bonds to the people, authorizes merely the in
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY, APRIL 20, 1899.
cttrring of municipal indebtedness. It contains no
grant of power by which cities may inaugurate public
improvements. The law for extending the panhandle,
therefore, must exist somewhere before bonds for the
enterprise can be issued. This is a proposition so
plain that it ought not to need illustration.
In the celebrated Shag Rock case the Supreme
Court held that the city and county of San Fran
cisco possesses no authority to acquire land for any
purpose not delegated to it by the consolidation act
In that case an attempt was made to purchase Shag
Rock as a site for a pesthouse.
We have not seen in connection with the panhandle
extension in the daily papers any reference to a statute
which authorizes the condemnation of this land for
the purposes specified. Some of the property-owners
interested have raised the question of jurisdiction, and
since the failure to thoroughly understand it before
voting on bonds is liable not only to jeopardize the
success of the scheme at the polls but to invalidate
the bonds afterward, the matter is of sufficient im
portance to merit thorough consideration. If the
people should vote bonds and it should be discov
ered afterward that the Supervisors had no authority
to acquire property for the panhandle extension, we
should be in a very pretty municipal mess.
The postponement of the election until the latter
part of July will give ample time in which to consider
this question. If a satisfactory conclusion is not then
reached a further postponement should be had.
FERRY DEPOT CHARGES.
ACTION taken by the Harbor Commissioners to
increase .the rate of rental of ferry depot
privileges to the various railway companies
making use of the building is a good step in the right
direction. If now the Commissioners will attend with
equal firmness to the task of reducing expenditures
and putting an end to waste in that direction the
ferry finances may ere long be in a satisfactory con
c':tion.
It is worth noting that in discussing the proposed
increase of charges upon the Southern Pacific Rail
road, and in protesting against it, Mr. Kruttschnitt,
general manager of the road, is reported to have
said: "We do not come before you in a spirit of
-aptious criticism, but merely to protest, as the com
pany has always done, against what we consider un
fair discrimination," and to have added, "We would
not care if we could add 10 per cent to the cost of
commutation tickets and make the public pay the
increased rental that way, but we cannot do that."
That statement is about as explicit as Mr. Hunting
ton's recent assertion that his company would make
the people of California pay the Central Pacific debt.
So long as the railroad can make the public bear all
the burden of taxes, rents, debts and other charges it
is well satisfied and makes no protest, but when it
cannot shift the burden then it talks of unfair dis
crimination and fights with fury.
The price charged for the use of the ferry depot to
the railroads is none too high. In fact, the low rates
charged by former Commissioners constituted a pub
lic scandal, as was pointed out by The Call and by the
Merchants' Association Review. What has been
c< i is therefore one step toward righting a grave
wrong, and, fortunately, it appears the result is not
gcing to be injurious to the public, as the railroads
cannot shift the burden.
The next step in the path of reform must be taken
in the direction of economical administration. It will
profit nothing to increase the revenues of the ferry
depot if the expenditures are increased, or even if
continued at the old wasteful rate. The commission
has started well on a good work, and the people will
now look for an earnest prosecution of it.
PRAISE FOR OUR SCHOOLS.
f~* ALIFORNIA, her institutions and her people,
I are so often subjected to misrepresentation and
adverse criticism in the East that any word of
commendation coming from that source has not only
the merit of truth but the charm of novelty. There
is, therefore, no little gratification to be felt in the
report Captain F. A. Kendall, president of the Board
of Education of Cleveland, Ohio, has just made
upon our public school system.
Having made a careful study of our schools during
a recent tour of the States on this coast, Captain
Kendall, in the course of an interview at Chicago
upon the result of his observations, is reported to
have said:
"California schools are the best in the country.
The State makes a more liberal appropriation than
anywhere else, and the idea of education is up to date,
industrial, manual and commercial. Boards of Edu
cation throughout the Great West are composed of
intelligent and progressive men. There is no politics
in it. Cultured ladies of different localities also make
schools their particular charge. In the city of Los
Angeles, a town of not over 100,000 inhabitants, there
were last year 25,000 visitors to the schools."
It would be easy to pick flaws in that statement.
Some of the assertions are not strictly accurate.
While politics in a certain sense of the word- has been
excluded from the schools, inasmuch as school
teachers are seldom if ever selected for partisan con
siderations, yet the jobbery and the corruption that
attend the practice of politics have been found in
school administration as well as elsewhere in county
and municipal affairs. Nevertheless, the fact remains
that our schools on the whole have been efficiently
maintained up to as high a standard as can be found
anywhere in the Union.
The excellence of our schools is due mainly to the
strength of public opinion in demanding a high
standard of character in the teachers. Jobbery, cor
ruption and frauds, amounting almost to open steal
ing, have too often been tolerated, but the appoint
ment of incompetent or unworthy teachers is an
offense that has never been condoned in any part of
the State. The result is we have one of the best
school systems in the world so far as the teaching is
concerned, but one of the most wasteful and extrava
gant in its maintenance.
When popular sentiment demands as high a stan
dard of efficiency and honesty in the School Board
as it does in the teacher's chair we shall have a school
system that will truly merit the praise of being the
best in the country- We are paying high for the ser
vice we obtain, and if we received the full value of
revenues so willingly paid the result would be the
admiration of the Union.
The report that upward of ioo tons of liquors
of all kinds destined for the Klondike have been held
at Skaguay by American officials because of the ar
bitrary action of Canadian authorities shows that a
bad state of feeling exists between the representatives
of the two Governments. There is no friendship
among men when they cease to pass the liquor along.
The dispatches announce that Emperor William of
Germany has been imposed upon by a confidence
operator. Investigation may show that the impostor
hails from Samoa, where Mataafa is busily engaged in
trying to induce his German Majesty to accept a gold

ANXIOUS TO
HEAR FROM
GAGE AND DAN
Expectant Linger in
the Palace Court.
PROTESTS AGAINST DELAY
TIME TO REWABD THOSE WHO
WON THE VICTORY.
Surmise That Certain Names on the
Governor's Slate Have Been
Recently Erased and New
Ones Added.
Applicants for official favor waited in
the Palace court all day long yesterday
for some word of good cheer from Sacra
mento. It came to their knowledge Mon
day morning that the Governor and D. M.
Burns were in Sacramento discussing the
subject of patronage distribution; hence
they were anxious to hear the result of
the deliberation. In the Palace group
were candidates for ftabor Commissioner,
Code Commissioner, Registrar of Voters,
Adjutant General and Highway Commis
sioner, besides many other candidates for
subordinate positions under the Board of
Health.
The politicians who are supposed to be
in the confidence of the Governor ex
pressed the opinion last night that the
expected appointments would not be de
layed much longer. In fart, they cannot
understand why there should be any fur
ther delay. They remark that the Sena
torial contest is over for the time being,
that the .Legislature has adjourned, that
the Governor has had his vacation and
much-needed rest, and therefore it is
time something was doing to help out the
men who marched and shouted for Gage
and Neff away back last fall. They dwell
on the fact that Democrats who were
booming Alaguire and blasting Gage are
still drawing stipends every month from
the public treasury, while the Republicans
who won the light are waiting for a
change and wondering why the Governor
does not act.
Before the Governor loft Los Angeles
he had made up his mind concerning the
Code Commissioners and the Paris Expo
sition Commission, it is surmised that
his prolonged conference with Burns im
mediately on his arrival at the Capitol
had reference to some suggested change
in the slate. In regard to the adjutant
generalship, the "organization," or. In
other words, certain members of the ex
ecutive committee of the Republican St;ite
Central Committee, will not again Inter
fere. One recommendation in this respect
was made, and therefore another one
could hardly be expected from the ma
chine. The clever politicians doubt the
propriety of making any recommenda
tions to the Governor regarding this of
fice, and very likely no more will be made
unless the Governor should see tit to in
vite suggestion and recommendation.
The Paris Commission is a different kind
of a trust. The people of the State are
deeply concerned in the selection of the
< ""inniipsinners. It would be a happy
in the State if a commission wholly
Independent of any railway corporation
could be' chosen, but it is said if the
Southern Pacific should get one member
the Santa Fe ought to have one, and the
people surely should get the third.
Ben C. Truman, formerly of the literary
department of the Southern Pacific, had
some exposition experience in the horti
cultural department of the 'World's Fair
at Chicago. He was appointed shortly
after he was crowded out of the Southern
Pacific. He did Borne very good work for
the company in describing the beauties of
Monterey as a summer and winter resort,
and found time apart from his engage
ments with the corporation to write a
book on dueling and contribute war
reminiscences to the New York Times.
No one In the building at Third and
Townsend ptreets found fault with Ben's
literary style, and when Mills was brought
down from Sacramento to succeed him
surprise was expressed. It is said that
Truman and Mills are slated for the Paris
Commission.
Warden Hale of SanQuentin was in town
yesterday. He says the notion entertained
; by many people that he desires to con
-1 tinue his service as Warden is anything
but correct, as he is anxious that hie sue
! cessor shall be chosen at once so that he
i can retire. He is fully conscious that his
I failing health demands his retirement.
Mr. Hale's successor will be chosen at
1 the meeting 1 of the directors of the prison
; next Saturday. There is no doubt that
. Mr. Agulrre of Los Angeles will get the
I place.
The reason for the recent postponement
! of ihe meeting of the Board of Regents of
1 the State University has transpired. The
I Governor expressed a desire for the post
ponement in order that he might be able
!to attend the session. When the subject
I of selecting a president of the university
i is called up there will probably lie a full
I attendance of regents, and the Governor
Ino doubt will preside. Lieutenant Gover
j nor Neff. \#io was in the city day before
! yesterday, remarked that he' intended to
Ibe preserjj at the session. On this occa
sion Stephen M. White will probably re
ceive the greetings of his brother regents.
CHAPLAIN WILL
TURN BENEDICT
Chaplain Brown of the
lowa to Wed Miss
Eaton, an East-
em Belle.
Chaplain Frederick C. Brown of the bat
tle-ship lowa will shortly wed Miss Emily
Eaton of Middleborough, Mass.
Chaplain Brown left on Monday evening
for Pasadena, there to meet his betrothed,
who has come all the way from htr far
Eastern home to become the chaplain's
bride.
The happy event is the culmination of a
romance that had its beginning several
years ago in the quiet little village of Mid
dleborough, a suburb of Boston. Mr.
Brown was stationed then as pastor of
the Unitarian church. He made his home
with the Eatons, who were in his congre
gation. Between him and Sites Emily
grew up a warm attachment, and when
he left the church a year ago to enter the
navy their troth had been plighted.
Chaplain Brown served during the war
in the North Atlantic squadron, and in
May waa assigned to the lowa, coming
here with the vessel a few months ago. He
has still two years to serve, and will go
with the vessel to Manila or wherever she
may be ordered.
The approaching event has been kept a
profound secret. The chaplain secured
leave of absence last Sunday for one week
but did not say where he was going. He
took the train for Los Angeles on Mon
day night, and it has been learned that
Miss P:aton was expected in Pasadena to
visit relatives there. They will arrive in
San Francisco on Friday, and the wed
ding will take place either on Friday or
Saturday evening. Rev. Dr. Horatio
Stebbins will offloia.te and will be assisted
by Rev. Stopford AY. Brooke, who is an
Intimate friend of Chaplain Brown.
After the wedding the young couple will
remain here until the lowa goes away
when the wife will return to New York'
where Chaplain Brown's parents reside '

SAN FRANCISCO-Subscriber, City
The following: from the Consolidation Act
of April 19. 1856. answers fully the question
as to the limits of San Francisco:
The corporation or body politic and cor
porate now existing and known as the
city of San Francisco shall remain and
continue to be a body corporate and poli- !
tic, in name and in fact \>y the name of
the City and County of San Francisco.
Â«Â£ bo nd aries of the City and County
of San Francisco: Beginning at the south
west corner, being the northwest corner
of San Mateo, in Pacific Ocean, on the i
extension of northern line of Township
Three south of Mount Diablo base: thence
northerly along the Pacific coast to its
point of intersection with westerly exten
sion of low water line on northern side of
the entrance to San Francisco Bay. being
southwest corner of Marin and northwest
corner of San Francisco; thence easterly
through Point Bonita and Point Caballo
to the most southeastern point of Angel
Island, all on line of Marin. as established i
by section 3957; thence northerly along the
eastern line of Marin to the northwest
point of Golden Rock, also known as Red
Rock, being a common corner of Marin !
Contra Costa and San Francisco; thence
due southeast four and one-half miles
moTe or less, to a point distant three stat
ute miles from the natural high water
mark on the eastern shore of San Francis
co Bay, being a common corner of Contra
Costa, Alameda and San Francisco;
thence southeasterly in a direct line to a
point three miles from said eastern shore
and on the line first named (considered as I
extending across said bay), and thence i
west along said first named line to the
place of beginning. The islands known as
the Farallones shall be attached to and
be a part of said city and county.
By the act of March 30, 1874, this de
scription was amended to make the west

AUDITOR WELLS
IS WILLING TO
PASS THE BUCK
Again November and
December Salaries.
WANTS FREEDOM IN OFFICE
ASKS JUDGE SEAWELL TO MODI-
FY AN ORDEB.
The Case Will Come Up Next Friday,
at Which Time the Application
Will Be Heard in Open
Court.
Judge Sf-awell yesterday continued the
case of Oscar Moses against the Board of
Education et al. until next Friday. On
that day John H. Dickinson, attorney f<>r
defendant, Auditor Asa R. Well?, will
move the court to modify an order here
tofore made so that Auditor M'ells shall
be permitted to audit the demands of the
teachers for the months of November and
December, deducting from each of them
any moneys due the city from any holder
of any demand by reason of any moneys
illegally paid such holder, and requesting
that warrants for the remainder be per
mitted to be audited and delivered to the
proper parties.
The motion will be made on the ground
that the order was improvidently made
and that the duties of the Auditor are in
terfered with in an unwarranted manner.
It is necessary, it is contended, that the
order be modified and set aside in order
that confusion and loss shall not result
regarding- moneys of the city and county.
To back up this motion for modification
of the order an affidavit made by Auditor
Wells, sotting forth a grievous tale, was
filed with the clerk. This affidavit ex
plains the entire situation as viewed by
wells, but there are other views, and
some difficulty is expected when the mo
tion comes up for hearing. This affidavit
reads:
I am the Auditor of the city and county of
San Francisco and have been during all the
times hereinafter mentioned. I am al
defendant in the action now pending in the
Superior Court and heretofi re an order in said
action containing the following language was
made and served upon me, and said order ll
still in full fore and effect:
"It is hereby ordered until the further order
of this court the said Auditor be and he is here
by restrained and enjoined from insuring any
warrants on demand of defendant I
the months ot" Novemtx
nothing- herein to be construed as an injunc
tion against the said Auditor using the said
demands as a mean? of offset for any 'If-niands
which may have been illegally paid said teach
ers heretofore."
By the terms of said order I am restrained
from property performing the duties of my of
fice in the makins up of my accounts, and th.ise
with the other officials of the city and county
of San Francisco, and I know of no v.
which I can use the demands mentioned in the
order as an offset for any purpose, unless I
am permitted to act upon the demands them
selves.
In the month of February last, believing that
the matters involved in the litigation In this
action would be determined at once, I did all
th.it I could to release the demands for the
ni'.nth of January, then awaiting audit, so
that they were paid, and the demands for Feb
ruary and March have also been paid and no
further move of any kind that I am awa
has been made in the action, and so far as I
am advised there Is no reason why the matters
Involved in the action should nut be di
of. certainly so far as this affiant and his
office la concerned.
Doubtless some confusion has been
brought about by the order of the court,
but it is obvious that the order was neces
sary, as has been explained before. Just
1m w much a modification of the original
order wouldassist toward reaching a final
i]i 'ision in the case Is not clear. That a
modification would allow Auditor Wells
to drag himself from the tangle there can
be no question, but it looks that "the
buck would pass up to the Treasurer" in
event of a modification, and the record
would be swollen in the legal scramble
following to prevent payment of even the
deducted warrants. The merchants ob
ject to the money being paid at all. oven
after "moneys Illegally paid out" have been
deducted, so It is doubtful that Wells' ef
fort to thus extricate himself will avail
him much, it being the general opinion
that h" must wait the trend of events and
final adjudication of the preplexing con
dition.
Stole the Mercury.
M. 11. Grovers, a junk-deaier at 1042*4
Howard street, waft arrested in Judge
Graham's court yesterday on the instruc
tions of the Judge. A mechanic's level
stolen from Fred Lehre three weeks ago
was recovered from Grovers on a .search
warrant, but when it was produced in
court yesterday Lehre showed that the
metal had been unscrewed from t..e level
and the mercury had gone, making the
level practically worthless. The Judge
promptly ordered Lehre to swear to a
warrant" for Grovers' arrest for petty lar
ceny.

SLID THROUGH THE WATER
LIKE AN ARROW LET LOOSE
SUCCESSrUL TRIP (T THE PEARLESS.
THE result of the trial trip ol the new tug Fearless was a flattering testimonial to the excellence of the
â work done by the Union Iron Works. The tug glided through the water with the grace and speed of
an arrow shot from a bow and elicited compliments from all obsen
The trial was most exacting, and was made at d'fferent speeds four times over a measured mile,
for the purpose of testing the working of her machinery under varying conditions. She more than ful
filled the most sanguine expectations of her builders and came fully up to the requirements of her owners,
John I 1 Bpn Bros. & Co. H<-r best speed was twelve and four-tenths knots an hour, which speed was
maintained regularly and easily.
Among those present on the tug were Irvine: M. Scott. Certain Lucky and Robert Forsythe, superintend
ing engineer of the Union Iron Works: John D. Srf^^kels and Captain McCoy. The Fearless proved to be
superior in appearance, more Bpeedy and more powerful than the old Fearless, which she- replaces.
There was not a hitch or a mis ay kind on the whole trip, and that !s something unusual on an
occasion of that ktr.d. Mr. Spreckels accepted the tug from the bui'dt-rs and was more than satisfied with
the excellent manner In which the builders had executed the task confided to them.
The Fearless will b< readj for busii iv and will be one of the must graceful and conspicuous of

moved into the water without a hitch.
"Sir Thomas Lipion's yacht Shamrock
was to have been built by Harland &

the firm had so much work on hand that
it could not undertake the job. Harland

enough contracts on hand to keep them
working night and day for two years.
Those two firms have six freight steam
ers on the ways, each one of which will
carry from 15,000 to 20.000 tons dead
weight. They are intended for the trade
between Liverpool and New York and, will
be the best and largest freight steamers
afloat. Besides these large vessels, the
firms named have smaller boats on the
ways also, and I tell you those yards
make up a scene that cannot be dupli
cated in the world. Sir Thomas Lipton
wanted the Shamrock built in Ireland.
In fact, he would have paid more than

built by Harland & Wolf, but they could
not afford to undertake such a small job

Captain Wallace is the most popular mas

A Most Interesting and Successful
Entertainment Given by the
Olympic Club.
Leader John Hammersmith of the
Olympic Club met with an agreeable sur
prise last evening when ed his
eyes upon the large gathering of
their escorts who assembled in the
handsome gymnasium Inns; before the
first feature of a splendid entertainment
was announced.
One of the most attractive programmes
that the members have ha"d the pleasure
of witnessing' In many moons was con
ducted with a -promptness that reflects
much credit upon the members who act
ed as the assistants to an able leader. The
banjo duet by Arthur Black and Will
McCrory was encored time and again.
The musical feature of the entertain
ment evidently "caught on," and it is
presumed that at future entertainments
of the kind music, both vocal and instru
mental, will be given a prominent part.
The dumbbell drill by pupils of the Grant
School was unquestionably a happy ad
dition to an excellent programme. The
young ladies, under the command of
Professor George Miohllng, went through
a drill that would reflect credit upon the
best drilled army now doing service in
the Philippines. The bell exercise was
loudly applauded by the large and en
thusiastic gathering, and it is presumed
that at future entertainments the drill
by ProfesÃor Miehling's pupils will prove
to be the most Interesting feature of the
evening The programme that was car
ried out with great success is as follows:

ENCAMPMENT OF
THE GRAND ARMY
CANDIDATES IN THE FIELD FOR
DEPARTMENT COMMANDER.
Plans for the Meeting at San Diego.
First Delegation Leaves
To-Day.
This evening the first delegation of
Grand Army veterans will leave this city
by rail for San Diego, where the thirty
third department encampment will begin
on Monday, May 1. Among those depart
ing are: Department Commander Sol Ca
hen, Adjutant General T. C. Masteller and
Mrs.Masteller, and Major J. H. Simpson,
nid-de-eamp. On the 28th inst. a large
delegation will leave by steamer, and the
day following others will go by rail. The
Woman's Relief Corps and the Ladies of
the Grand Army also hold their encamp
ments at the same time in San Diego.
Among those who will go from this city
are: General Edward S. Salomon, Colon^i
W. R. Smedberg, Colonel C. Mason Kinne
and Mrs. Kinne, Colonel J. G. Getsttng,
Charles H. Blinn, .T. J. Scoville, A. Mont
ner. Judge A. J. Buckles, Henry C. Dib
ble, Judge J. M. Walling, J. H. Hilton,
Charles Kdelman. Phil Fisher, Colonel J.
C. Currier, Colonel J. .M. Litchfield and
Frank Elliott Myers.
The people of San Dtego are making ex
tensive preparations for the entertain
ment of the veterans, and as this IS the
first time a Grand Army encampment has
been held in that city, the old soldiers are
looking- ; war.l with pleasant anticipa
tion to the hospitality promised them.
There will be no doubt be a strong con
test made by those who aspire to succeed
Commander hen. Los Angeles comes to
the front with two candidates in the per-
Fon of A. C. Shafer of Stanton Post No.
55, and W. H. Seamans of Bartlett-Logan
Post No. 6, both of whom have a fair
following, with the chances in favor of
the former. A. J. Bell of Gushing Post
No. 44. Ventura, is also after the honor,
while Captain A. F. Dill of Heintzelman
Post So. 65. San Diego, seeks the dis
tinction and has much to favor him. He
is not only popular in his own locality,
but possesses many friends among his
comrades from northern posts, he hav
ing been formerly a member of James A.
Garfield Post of this city. While it is
generally conceded that the southern part
of the State should have the honor, it
is by no means certain that the comrades
down there will be able to harmonize upon
any one candidate, in which event some
aspirant from the north may be the suc
cessful one. Joseph G. delating of George
H. Thomas Post has announced himself
for first place, whit--' Henry C. Dibble of
Lincoln Post, both of this city, some time
ago gave it out that he was quite willing
to wear the two stars. Lately, however,
the latter has signified his satisfaction to
be made senior vice commander, but if
there is a possible chance for the honor
to go to some one from this city the Judge
will no doubt promptly repair his fences
so that nothing will escape his pasture.
Before the encampment meets Comman
der Cahen and his staff will make official
visits to posts, as follows: Los Angeles,
to-morrow; San Bernardino, 22d; River
side. 24th; Santa Ana, 25th', Soldier*'
Home (Santa Monica). 26th ; Pasadena,
27th, and San Diego, 2Sth. These visits,
added to those heretofore made by Com
mander Cahen, will make his . record
larger than that of any other commander
save one in many years. In these visits
he has met personally thousands of vet
erans, and accomplished much that is
good for the order. His administration
has been singularly successful,* and will
long be remembered by his old comrades
and himself as one of the most pleasant
periods of his life.

MERCHANTS ARE
GIVEN ALL THE
AVAILABLE GASH
Compromise With the
Teachers.
LATTER RETAIN WARRANTS
ALL PENDING LITIGATION TO BE
ABANDONED.
Straightening Out the Claims for
Salaries and Supplies Against
the Former School
Board.
Word was circulated late yesterday aft
ernoon among the merchants having
j claims against the School Department I
, contracted during the incumbency of the \
! former Board of Education that the com
j mittee appointed from among their num
ber and a like committee of the school
teachers had reached an agreement, the
terms of which were even more satisfac
tory to the merchants than those they
had first submitted to the teachers.
This agreement, which the merchants
were assured would be signed by the
members of both committees without de
lay, gives to the merchants all the avail
able funds, amounting to $35,000 or there
abouts, now at the disposal of the School
Board, to be applied to the old claims, and
in return the teachers are to retain their j
warrants for November and December
salaries, while in the event of any money
coming into possession of the board from
! any unexpected source, such as the inher
itance tax, for Instance, or there being a
surplus at the end of the fiscal year, it
shall be divided between the teachers and
merchants In the proportion of about 9 ;
to 1 in favor of the teachers. By the I
terms of the compromise the teachers are
to dismiss all pending litigation, includ
ing the suits Moses vs. The Board of Edu
cation, Brooks vs. The Auditor and Board
of Education, and Morse vs. the same de
fendants. In return the merchants were
forced to reduce the total of their claims
by $17,008, making it approximately J71.0W.
The merchants are elated over the terms
of the compromise, and well they may be,
for they are enabled to divide among
themselves at once f36,000, while the teach
era must look to the uncertain future for j
any portion of their salaries for the
months of November and December. But
: in justice to the members of the commit
tee representing the teachers it may be
added that they did not surrender their
i claim to this money on their own respon
sibility. On the contrary, the teachers
themselves forced them into the step.
At a recent meeting of the teachers the
committee submitted a report embodying
an offer from the merchants whereby the
teachers were to place their warrants tor
the two months in the hands of a trustee
as a guarantee of gocd faith, the mer
chants to adopt a similar course in regard
to their claims. The available funds, at
that time supposed to amount to much
more than $35,U00, were to be equally di- i
vided between the teachers and "mer
chants, and any funds thai could be de
voted to the purpose in future were also
to be divided. When this proposition was
submitted there was a great commotion
among the teachers. A large majority
fancied. the placing of their warrants In
a trustee's hands meant the absolute as
signment of them, and that they would
receive but a Email portion of .the" amount
due them after having surrendered their
claims.
At a subsequent meeting the teachers
rejected the offer and expressly instructed
their committee not to enter into any
i agreement whereby Ihe teachers were to
< give up possession of their warrants.
Kather than to do that they were willing
the merchants should take the entire
amount of available funds. With those
instructions the committee could only
make the best terms possible with the
result that the merchants last night were 'â â 
j chuckling over the agreement which, they
say, has been definitely adopted and only
awaits the signatures of the members of j
: the two committees.
The merchants arid other creditors, |
aside from the teachers Aid Including la
borers, have placed theft* claims in the
hands of a trustee, who will draw the
money and divide it pro rata among them.
The teachers, besides surrendering half
of the 135,000, or $17,000, which the mer
chants offered them, nave, by agreeing
to abandon all litigation, left the legal :
status of their salaries as badly muddled i
i as ever.

Board of Hospital Commissioners.
The question of committees receiving a
per diem while transacting business for
State 'hospitals was .-settled yesterday in
an opinion handed down by Attorney Gen
eral Tiny L. Ford. The opinion contains
the information that all committees and
F'lh-commtttpps shall receive compensa
tion while acting in such capacity. The
State Board of Commit r any
part thereof, will not be compensated for
visits to hospitals to- attend inves
tions of hospital affairs, as the law
not require their presence; nor will they
be paid while attending the hospitals dur
ing visits of the executive or members of
the Legislature or on other offleial occa
sions. They will, however, be compensated
according to statute, while they are pres
ent on official visits of official inspection
or when they constitute a board of exam
iners at civil service examinations.
STANDING TOGETHER.
Soldiers Will Not Tell Who Were
Bioting on Sunday Night.
Investigation into the riot of Sunday
night at the Presidio is no nearer a suc
cessful conclusion than it was when it
started. It seems to be hung between the
civil and military authorities with every
prospect of no result. The military peo
pie fay they can only question the men
and unless some one can come and identi
fy some of the men who were in the riot
they cannot do anything unless the ring
leaders confess. Rehfeld says he cannot
identify any of the men who assaulter 1 ,
his place, but he thinks the police offi
cers who were there ought to be able to
do so. The police say Rehfeld can iden
tify at least two or three of the men he
saw around his saloon if he wants to.
and so the matter is passed from one to
the other, while the "casuals" who were
mixed up in the row are being assigned
to transports for service in the Philip
pines.
One man, Arthur Billings, who has been
ordered on board the Warren, was taken
back to the post yesterday because it was
supposed he knew something of the row,
but his information has not affected mat
ters much so far. Fifty others were also
ordered off the transport because It was
believed she was too crowded.
Mary Alice Burrell, Wilha Dockrill.
Margaret Bertram, Mary Hambly, Carrie
Howard and Salina Hayden, Red Cross
nurses, have been ordered to prepare
themselves for service in the Philippines.
They will be taken out there in the trans
port Newport.

* The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the well known remedy,
Syriri of Figs, manufactured by the

the value of obtaining 1 the liquid laxa-
tive principles of plants known to be

is the one perfect strengthening iaxa-
Hive, clean sinsr the system effectually,

gently yet promptly and enabling one

stance, and its acting- on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening;
or irritating- them, make it the ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing- figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the

EASTERN MARKETa
NEW Yi'M. MARKET.
NF.w YORK. April 19 There Is a certain
contingent of Flock Exchange speculators who
base -their ventures for the day on the tend
ency of prices displayed at the immediate open
ing of the market. To- day's initial trading
pave promise of an active and strong market j
and induced some outside buying-, but there
was a development of weakness in the after
noon. The early demand was stimulated by the
decided strength displayed by the granger
group, which was helped by reputed more fa
vorable climatic conditions In the wheat 'belt
and an encouraging statement by the Gov
ernment of the general crop conditions. These
circumstances caused a relapse in wheat prices,
which were also influenced by heaviness in
Liverpool. Interest ran mainly to railway
etocks and some of the individual interests be
came prominent. It must not be inferred that
there was an entire abandonment of profes
sional operations in the specialties, ac these
properties were utilized at times â¢as a lever
to enhance or depress values of other shares.
In fact the afternoon's weakness could be di
rectly traceable to a brisk selling movement
on ih. 1 high-priced specialties, which received
momentum subsequently through liberal offer-
Ings of the grangers on late report* of crop
damage. This statement was colored to some
extent by a sharji rise in wheat, with the
thorts covering heavily. The late break en
tirely eradicated the gains in the railways ana
put many of the specialties considerably below
last night's close. Brooklyn Transit. Manhat
tan and Tennessee Coal and Iron yielded the
most readily. Pronounced strength was die
played in Colorado Fuel and Iron shares, which
retained advances of over 5 points each in the
common and erred on rumors pending fa
vorable developments in the efforts to harmon
ize the conflicting elements In the anthracite
coal trade and the adoption of a schedule
of prices for the spring caused sharp advances
in thÂ»>se stocks, which moved counter to the
general market at the close. The market ended
irregular, with the railway list little changed.
Good support was extended to the bond mar
ket and t<ome substantial gains occurred on an
active demand. Total sales, $4,140,000.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. April 19.-Wheat started easier in
response to lower cables and continuance of
yesterdays liquidation. Early crop news also
seemed bullish, as several sections reported the
situation promising. Up to noon trade was
light and scalpers were Inclined to short the
market. However, the crop-killing machinery
! got into working order again and thÂ« bulls
who already had wheat bought more. Toward
the end of th* session sellers of calls for the
day were forced to hedge by purchasing the
options. Offering? became light and a general
stampede followed, shorts covering early sales
at fair losses. July got to a premium of V>e
over May, and as th*re was a good urnrit In
carrying th- latter, elevator people bought
heavily of May. May opened >;<? to >*.c. at 73%
<S73?sc, Improved ciowly during the forenoon;
then became very strong and jumped up to Tic.
closing at 74Vu7r..\ July, which opened at 74\,
<574% c, rose to 76% c and closed at 76Vi@763iC.
Aggregate receipts at principal Western pri
mary markets were considerably smaller than
a year ago. Atlantic exports of wheat and
flour amounted to 17S,0fi<j bushels.
Corn started weak and received little
assistance from the bullishness of wheat until
near the clot The feeling among corn specu
lators was that plowing up of wheat would
mean that much added to the acreage of corn
May corn closed H,c higher.
Oats were steadied by light receipts and buy
ing by shippers on account of the reduction to
be made in rates. May oats closed a shade
higher.
Provisions were heavy to begin with, but im
proved, owing to higher prices at the yards and
in sympathy with wheat. Shorts bought and
liquidation of May was not so much in evi
dence. May pork Closed 7%c higher. The
range in lard and ribs was small.

of rain in all States except Kansas tended to
check the advance. Light showers were re
ported east of the Mississippi last night.

DRIED FRUITS. NUTS AND RAISINS.
Bad news was received from the Prune crop
yesterday. A prominent house In the trade re
ceived telephone' massages and letters "from
the three largest districts In the State that
the severest drop ever known la now going on,
and. one district reported that it would be
lucky to get a quarter of a crop. The news
was a shock to the street, for up to lately the
crop was supposed to be looking well. How
ever, it was known around Sonoma a fortnight
ago that the crop would be almost a failure,
but ii was thought that the damage was con
fined to that district, but it is now proving
general. As there have been no frosts of any
consequence this spring the drop Is ascribed
to the dry weather last year, which left the
trees too weak to mature this year's crop. It
is to be hoped that the conditions are not as bad
as described yesterday, but another week will
tell the story. â¢
To partially offset this discouraging news
from the Prune crop, the Apricot crop Is re
ported looking rather better.

When Charley called at the hou?e for his
umbrella Will declared that it was his.
and Charley protested that "It !s mine."
Then the war bÂ«gan. They came to blows,
and the sisters and the father took a
iaiid. Shirts were rippod to pieces, fire
wood was used for a weapon, and r.ot un
til the hired man came in was peace re-
L Miss* Ella Pryal, an exceedingly hand
some young lady, went on the witness
stand and told of the sad occurrence at j
the Pryal home. â¢'Charley called tor his :
umbrella." she said, 'ur.d Will objected â¢
that he was not taking his own umbrella, j
They came into the sitting room, where
we "all were, and there was a quarrel.
Will took a piece of hard wool < produced
in evidence) and struck Charley on the
head with :: becau.-'e Charley was so
boisterous. I attempted to pull them
apart and took a strong hold of Charley's
shirt collar, but the collar gave way and
- :.'. was torn off his back."
Mis.- Pry-at's story made It plain that
while she tried to keep Charley away
from Wil!, Will was held dowii by the !
other two listers, who sat upon him in I
one comer of the room. Charley was evi
dentiv able to keep at bay the whol*
family?

This was cot the only story of the fight in
the court. Prison Director R. M. Fitz

branch of Alameda's Democracy, was
counsel for Charles Prya-1, the complain
ing witness. Colonel Thomas F. Garrity,
a foremost leader of the other wing of
Alameda's Democracy, appeared for the
defendant. And they wanted to light.
There has been righting in the Pryal fami
ly over the mother's estate, and Attorney
Garrity persisted in asking Will Pryal if
there had not been a quarrel in the family
for months over the estate of their de
ceased mother.
Attorney Fitzgerald objected, Garrity
perslsted; Fitzgerald got angry, Garrity
defiant.
Finally Fitzgerald broke out: "You are
not big enough nor ugly enough to bully
mej .i..d it you think you are step outside
the courtroom and try."
"You just take care of yourself." re- I
torted Mr. Garrfty, "ar.d you will find
that I am able to take care of myself. 1 *
Attorney Samuels; representing the Dis- i

EEP.KELEY, April 19.-The Art Asso
ciation, an organization recently started
among university people, closed a two
days' exhibition of pictures and art pro
ductions this evening. It was a very suc
cessful affair, drawing- an unusually large
number of visitors. The pictures were ar
ranged for display in Stiles Hall, William
Keith and other California artists receiv
ing: prominent places. The Keith collec
tion, loaned for the occasion by art lovers
of Berkeley and San Francisco, consti
tuted without doubt the finest group of
the local artist's work which has ever
t-een exhibited in public. Through
the courtesy of Clarence \V. Maybeck, In
structor in drawing, the mounted photo
graphs from the library of architecture,
donated to the university by Mrs. Phebe
Hearst, were shown for the first time.
During the course of thÂ»; exhibition two
lectures on art topics had be*?n arranged
for. Yesterday evening Professor C. B.
Bradley spoke upon "Medieval Art."
This afternoon Charles W. Keeler gave a
short address upon William Keith.

ble Condition of Willis Dodge
ana Family.
Accompanied by his half-starved wife
and carrying in his arms an eighteen
months old infant, Willis Dodge walked
Into the Central station last evening and
\ ' jrg-d for something to â¢ at. In th- cor
ridor stood his eldest boy, a lad â :' five
years, who plainly showed the ravages of
hunger. Amid tears Dodge said that he
and his family had arrived yesterday from
Seattle, expecting to meet a friend who is
an engineer, at the ferry. The latter
failed to materialize and the unfortunate
family, hungry and pc-nniless, started up
Mfjrk'-t street in the hope of ling some
way who would at least supply them with
something to eat. After walking the
streets until they wore nearly exhausted,
and as their two children were crying for
bread which they could not give them,
Dodge concluded to visit police headquar
ters, expecting to find a .place to sleep.
After listening to their sad story Lieu
tenant Birdsail raised a purse of Vj to
which he added $2 50. After giving 'the
amount to Dodse he took him and his
family to a restaurant contiguous to po
lice headquarters and instructed the pro
prietor to give them as many meals as
th^y desired and send the bill to him.
The kind-hearted lieutenant also secured
a room for them in a house at Fulton
and Larkln streets.
On learning of the sad condition of
Dodge and his family Police Officer But
t?rworth. president of the Widows' and
Orphans' Association, offered to allow
them to occupy his unfurnished house,
containing three rooms. As the poverty
stricken family Is without furniture
IÂ»dgo. after profusely, thanking Butter
worth, declined his offer. It is the Inten
tion of the police to-day to Interest one of
the many charitable organizations in be
half of Dodge and his family.

STANFORD BOYS WILL
GET BACK THE AX
BERKELEY will return the *x -which she took from Stanford after the
baseball game last Saturday. The California men are somewhat dl
vided in opinion as to the proper course to be pursued In the matter,
but those who were directly responsible for capturing the trophy and
who have It under guard fnvor giving It back.
Charlie Prina the custodian of the ax. and Dave Brown of Stanford
met upon the campus this afternoon. Prlngle made overtures for turning
over the mascot, and Brown agreed to send -word to Palo Alto. It is prob
able that a committee of Stanford men win come up to Berkeley, and the
ax will then be placed in their hands. ,
A large number of the Berkeley collegians dislike to see the trophy leave
the hands of the blue and gold and they are making a strong effort to have
it retained. But It is quite settled now that Stanford shall receive ber mas
cot back. The return will be made before the intercollegiate field-day
next Saturday. It is likely that when Stanford gets the ax the blade will
be bored through with the scores of all the Intercollegiate events of the
past year.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, April 19.â faculty here has received a
letter from the Berkeley faculty to the effect that unless some assurance
was given that no riot would take place the field-day would be declared off.
The situation Is becoming serious and steps are being considered as to
the best means of keeping down the disturbance. Any serious friction
caused Saturday would probably result In putting a stop to Intercolle
giate tests for several years.

DENIES CHARGES OF CEUELTY.
Harry Gray Angry at Mr. Holbrook
of the Animals Society.
Harry Gray of Gray Bros., contractors.
Is very much incensed at the statements
made by Secretary Holbrook of th So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to An
imals. Mr. Holbrook arrested two of the
contractors' men on Tuesday upon
charges of cruelty to animals, and stated
that the officers of his society were
obliged to condemn and kill two horses
belonging to Gray Bros, that were being
work- on the grade on Bay street, be
cause of the animals being afflicted with
about all of the ills that horseflesh is
heir to. He said that he called as ad
visers two veterinary surgeons, who pro
nounced the animals unfit for work, being
20 years old, aside from their general in
firmities. According to the same author
ity the officers went to Gray Bros.' sta
bles and condemned six more horses us
unfit for work.
Mr. Gray takes exceptions to all these
statements, and says in no uncertain lan
guage that there is not a particle of truth
in them. He denies that the horses are 20
years old, or that they were shot by the
officers or any one. He asserts that Mr.
Holbrook lid not enter the stables or con
demn any of his horses, and adds that
the arrest of the contractors" stableman
and driver was -without warrant or Justi
tication. â â  Â-.. il
"In the first place." said Mr. Gray, "we
have over a hundred horses at work and
out of the lot there may be a few sick at
times but these we never use, as we have
enough well ones to do the work. The
horses that Mr Holbrook says were shot
are alive and well. When they went to work
yesterday they were as sound as the usual
run of work horses are. One was slightly
afflicted with a 'cork.' but that is not
serious. The other's foot was slightly
pricked by the horseshoer before it went
to work. ' As to the two veterinary sur
geons that Mr. Holbrock called In, the
only thing that is the matter with them
Is that we have refused to let them have
the care of our stock, and this is the
way they think to get back at us. I will
make it pretty hot for these "fellows who
are making false -statements about our
being cruel to our horiÂ«a," /......;. . â

DIED FOR HIS COUNTRY.
31. L. Seemann Slain in Battle Before
He Had Beached His Majority.
Advices by the Coptic from Manila
bring sorrow into one more household in
San Francisco. Although the relatives of
M. L. Se*mar.n had ">een advised through
the telegrams from the seat of war in
th-i Philippines of his death, still they
hoped against hope that it was not true,
until the confirmation came from the cap
tain of his company.
Young Seemann came here from Den
mark when he was â¢ years old and was
brought up in the household of C. N. Jen
sen his brother-in-law. When the war
broke out and the California boys were
mustered Into service ne was only 20 years
old. He tried hard to join the First Heel
ment and when he failed he enlisted in the
Fourteenth Infantry. He was assigned
to Company A and went to Manila on the
troopship Scandia on her first voyage.
The letter containing the news of his
death is as follows:
MANILA. P. I . March 15, ÃB9.
Mr?. C. N. Jensen, San Franciscoâ Dear
Madam: You were doubtless notified In due
time of the death of your brother. M L.
Sremann, in tattle February' '. 1533. near Ma
nila.
At about 11 o'clock a. m. that day I was
ordered to attack the Filipino trenches in our
front with two companies of the Fourteenth
Infantry. A and C. We advanced through
dense brush until we were within fifty paces
of the enemy. We stopped several times to
return the fire of the Filipinos, and it was at
the stop nearest their tine, while your brother
was kneeling to fire, that a bullet parsed
throueh his right eye and out throuch the
back of hi 3 head, killing him instantly. I
saw him as he fell and I don't think he made
a movement after he was struck, and his
death must have been painless, it was so
sudden.

Sporting Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: The
Pacific Coast Trotting Horse Breeders' Asso
ciation is the first in California to announce a
list of ptinÂ»a for this year. The purses offered
are large and the terms liberal, and It only
awaits the efforts of t-he horsemen on this
coast to make ISSri a prosperous year for all
who are interested in harness racing-.
The District Fair Associations have had the
State appropriations restored to them and thÂ«y
will nearly all give fairs and race meeting!
this year, and a regular circuit will be ar
ranged as formerly when the fairs received
State aid. If the Breeders' Association re
ceives a biK entry list it will encourage the
District Fair Associations to also offer liberal
purses. It is to the interest of even' horseman
not only to enter his own horses in as many
of the purses advertised as he car find places
for them, but to encourage and solicit entries
from ail who have horses in training in his
locality. He ehould take a personal interest
in this matter and work hard to secure the
best result*.
The owners of stallions should encourage, as
far as possible, the entering In races of the
get of their stallions, and breeding farms
should pursue the same course, as nothing ad
vertises them better or attracts more attention
to a horse or a farm than to be liberally rep
resented in purses and stakes.
Trusting that you will appreciate the Im
portance of doing ail you can to make harness
racing on this coaÂ«t a success this yÂ»ar. I am,
yours very truly. F. W. KELLET. Sec.

accompanied by a male friend, who in
formed the Judge that there was to be
a' compromise, as Rosenthal did not wish
to prosecute her.
Prosecuting Attorney Wentworth said
he would have something to say about
that, and as far as he was concerned
there would be no compromise. Attorney
McNear said he had been engaged to spe- :
cially prosecute the case for Rosenthal
and he knew of no compromise.
The defendant then asked for a contin- '

GRAND BALL AND
A MUSICALE
AT ARBOR VILLA.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call. '
908 Broadway, April 19.
ARBOR VILLA, the palatial home of
Francis M. Smith, whom the #Jbllc
has designated the "Borax King" of j
this country, -was last evening the j
scene of a ball, musicals and fete that
from the point of brilliancy, color and ;
wealth equaled anything of the kind ever j
before attempted in California. Arbor j
Villa, after more than four years of build- i
ing. has just been finished in its perfect';
entirety, and last evening was the occa- |
sion upon which Mr. Smith and his fam
ily took the opportunity to extend to some
1400 of their friends the invitation to ac
cept of the hospitality of their new home.
The residence, which is surrounded by j
a rolling wealth of beautiful grounds, is |
situated on Piedmont Heights. It has |
been built at a cost of over a million of j
dollars and for a residence of its kind
only has its equal in the summer homes
of the New York millionaires of Newport.
Every mechanical convenience for com- j
fort and luxury, every beauty of the dec- j
orative art, and, in fact, every possible .
perfection in house building that wealth !
can command or suggest is within the j
walls of Arbor Villa.
For a month Oakland society has talked j
of nothing else than the coming ball, and
there was quite a little uneasiness until
the invitations had been sent out. More ;
than a thousand people availed them- ,
selves of the hospitality of Arbor Villa ;
last evening and were participants in a \
social gathering that will remain green in |
their memories for years to come. The j
invitations were not limited solely to the i
exclusive set of Oakland, for the social !
leaders of San Francisco. Berkeley, Ala- j
meda and other places about the bay i
were present.
The guests began to arrive shortly after i
8 o'clock, and for more than two hours a j
long train of carriages continued to roll j
up to the handsome porte-cochere and j
deposit their loads of well groomed men j
and women. The Eighth-avenue car line. J
of which Mr. Smith is the controller, was !
run for the special convenience of his j
guests, and several hundred availed them- j
selves of this means of getting to Arbor
Villa from Oakland. As rapidly as the
guests arrived they were shown to the
second iloor, where they deposited their j
wraps prior to descending to the main oc- ;
tagonal hallway, where Mr. and Mrs.
Smith, with their friends who assisted
them In receiving, were stationed. In ad- !
ditlon to the host and hostess those who
helped to receive were: Mrs. Pedar Sath
er, Mrs. Edwin Goodall. Mrs. Henry j
Wetherbee, Mrs. 11. C. Taft, Mrs. H. |
Trowbridge and Miss Grace Sperry-
The entire house was thrown .en to !
the guests, who were lav: in their ad- j
miration of its beauty, but who were j
powerless to express in words their ap- \
preciation of Its artistic perfection. The j
general effect is hard oak with carved j
nnlahings and inlaid floors. From each j
.-:4.c of the octagonal hallway opens a se- j
ritÂ»s of rooms nr.is=hed in different kinds
of woods, with tapestries, paintings and {
furnishings to harmonize. The decora- 1
tions last even.: were oak leaves, ferns ;
ar.d American Beauty roses. Of these I
there was the profusion. esoe- ;
cially in the banquet hall, where thou- j
sands of roses were used. On the second !
floor is the Aeolian pipe-organ of two |
manuals and pedals, and which contains !
twenty-seven stops and accessories. This
one feature of luxury at Arbor Villa was \
built at the cost cf many thousands of j
dollars.
After the guests had assembled the mv- ,
sical programme, which was under the I
direction of A. M. Benham of the First j
Congregational Church, Oakland, was !
rendered. It consisted of eight selections, j
which were contributed by the following j
of the guests: W. D. Wood. E. D. â  'ran- ;
dail, Putnam Griswold. H. L. Taylor, Dr. i
"W. K. Scott, Miss Josephine Chabot,
Misses Lucy and Alice Motntt. Miss Jean
Mary Hush. Miss Florence Hush, Mrs.
Martin Schultz. Miss J. Virginie de Fre
mery. Mr- Carroll Nicholson, Miss Etta
Marvin and Siarnor Galvani. At the con
clusion of the musicale the younger of
the guests betook themselves to the grand
ballroom and theater combined, where !
they enjoyed the pleasures of the mazy
waltz and blithesome two-step. The mv- i
sic for the, dance was furnished by an :
orchestra embowered from sight behind [
a profusion of ferns, oak leaves and I
potted plants. During the earlier part of .
the evening light, refreshments such a.-; |
ices and other dainty things were served.
At 1U o'clock the banquet was announced
and the guests betook themselves to the j
banquet hall, where every delicacy, both j
solid and liquid, known tc the conception '
of a Parisian chef was served in the |
greatest abundance.
A notable feature of the gathering was

FOR PRESIDENT
State Medical Society's
Election.
Special Dispatch to The- Call.
DEL MONTE, April 10.â second
day of the State Medical Society meet
ing; opened with a much larger attend
ance than was noted on Tuesday. The
morning session was not crowded, owing
to the fact that many members of the
soeioly hnd taken advantage of the un
usually fine morning to take the seven
teen-mile drive. Four or five four-horse
teams were needed to take the doctors
and their wives.
The scientific side of the meeting: was
not, however, entirely forgotten, for sev
eral important papers were : ad. Dr. 11.
Bert Ellis of Los Angeles presented a pa
per entitled. "Hypertrophy of the Pha
ryngeal Tonsil and Its Relation to Ear
Troubles." Dr. J. Denis Arnold Of San
Francisco gave a "Contribution to the
Study of Aural Diseases"; Dr. E. J.
titled,
, â â  . i teorge C.
c liuii
and a
-
At the afternoon session the attendance
â was greater and the interest taken In the
papers considerable. Dr. Ryfkogel save
a resume of the recant advances result
ing from the use of the scope, in
discussing this paper, Dr. Sherman of
Merced stated thut the germ of consump
tion had recently been lund In timothy
ami other kinds of hay, ami thought this
might account for some cases of tuber
culosis in cattle.
Dr. D. VV. Montgomery showed speci
mens and gave a history of a case of
rare and "marked deformity of the nails
Jn leprosy." This was folio-wed by a
paper by Dr. OphulE, suggested by a case
he had recently seen of "foreign body in
the heart." He recalled a number of
cases in which bullets, pins, pieces of
wood; etc., had been forced into the heart
and had remained there from eleven days
to twenty years without doins? any par
ticular harm. . . ,
Dr. - port
â 
eri K. Mof
l
of the
Francisco
with lan
f the
Dr. P. J. H. Farre'.l, recently with the
nrmy in Manila, talked about "Our Sick
and Wounded in the Philippines." Dr.
Farrell said the sick and wounded were
well cared for and looked after. Sun
stroke and kindred affections are the
most prominent in Manila; the heavy
drinkers are most commonly affected.
They often come in from duty in the
sun with a temperature of 104 deprees;
a f.^w days in the hospital quite restore
them; however. A few drinks and a hot
n;:n often produce temporary insanity.
Reports from the treasurer and secre
tary showed the society to be In a flour
is,hing condition, and the treasurer sug
gested that the dues for the year : â â  re
mitten.
A great surprise to the members at
tending: was the absence of the expected
political tight. Dr. Ross of Sacramento,
who had been p'aggested for the presi
dency by Dr. Winslow Anderson, with
drew and left a free tiold to Dr. George
Chlsmore of San Francisco, who as
elected by acclamation. Dr. G. w.
Davis was elected first and Dr. E. E.

LIEUT, PRICE
IS REDUCED
TO A SERGEANT
Says He Will Resign
From Police.
WAS NOT ALLOWED A HEARING
CHINATOWN SQUAD WTLL BE
REMOVED FROM DISTRICT.
Commissioners Sustain Charges of
Inefficiency and Neglect of Duty
Against the Patrolmen
Composing It.
"The judgment of the board Is that for
rot maintaining the efficiency of the Po
lice Department In Chinatown it la or
dered that the squad be removed at once
and others detailed to take their places,
and that Lieutenant William Price be
releÂ£ra.tod to the duties of a sergeant."
The foregoing is the result of the in
quiry Instituted some weeks since by the
Board of Police Commissioners on an in
tangible charge of corruption In China
town. The action of the board was taken
on the ground that inefficiency and neg
lect of duty had been proved against
Lieutenant Price and his squad. The
charges, by implication, that some of the
Immense corruption fund raised in China
town htid been taken by the men charged
â with the suppression of gambling ar.d
other vices In the district was not
brought home to them.
The action of the Commissioners was
taken at an executive meeting held last
night. The entire proceedings were held
behind closed doors. The only witness
examined was Harry I. Fisher, a re
porter, lie wrote the original story on the
corruption fund raised by the Chinese. It
was based on rumor, and he was never
able to learn how the money was dis
tributed, ior over two hours the Com
missioners discussed the evidence sub
mitted to them. At the end of that time
they announced their lings in the case.
Commissioners Tobin, Alvord and
Gunst and Chief of Police Lees voted to
remove the squad now on duty at once.
Chief Lees alone voted against reducing
Price from a lieutenant to a sergeant.
when the matter was first broached
Commissioner Gunst moved he be dis
missed the service. Commissioner Alvord
demurred to this. GunsÂ£ then moved
he be reduced to the ranks. This also
met with opposition from Alvord. As a
last resource Gunst moved he be reduced
to a sergeant. This motion prevailed,
Chief Le<s alone voting against it.
"The charges upon Lien our action
â was based were those of inefficiency and
neglect of duty," said Commissioner To
bin sifter the meeting. "The charges of
corruption were not sustained."
"I voted with the Commissioners on ...
removal of the squad from Chinatown
because 1 knew its usefulness had been
impaired by the newspaper stories re
garding corruption in Chinatown," said
Chief Lees after the meeting. "On the
question "f reducing Lieutenant Price to
ji sergeant I voted no on the dictates of
my conscience. I believe the Commts-
Bioners voted as they did conscientiously.
1 did not think there h.id been neglect of
duty on the part of Price. 1 will appoint
the now squad as soon as poi-'siblf-. I
have given its make-up some consielera
tion, but have not fully determined who
shall compose It."
Lieutenant Price and the men under
him requested the privilege of appearing
before the board aqti presenting their de
fense. This was not accorded them, nor
were they permitted representation at the
ineÂ°tii!ss of the commission when evidence
was being received. Price was at police
headquarters during the session of the
board last night. After the meeting ha
Baid: "I will present my resignation at
once. They may have my star, as 1 have
no desire to be connected with the depart
ment any longer. 1 blame Commissioner
Gunst for all this, as I believe he was
the moving spirit in the matter. I was
not allowed the hearing which is accorded
ail persons under trial."
In Chinatown the news Fpread like wild
f.re and on every corner excited groups
assembled to discuss the situation, Cour
iers sped from club to club and explained !
the situation to the managers. Many of
the clul>m<-n belong to what may be
termed the better class of Chineseâ that
is. the men who fear the highbinders and
eTesiro police protection. These received
thi- news with every outward manifesta
tion of porrnv.
One and ati laid the whole trouble at !
the doors of the highbinders. It is stated !
that since Price and his squad
have beer, in Chinatown the highbinders I
have made little or no trouble. New all
fear that the old highbinder system of '
blackmailing will be renewed. One of
them. !n explaining the situation, says:
"It dors no: count how much a man
knows about methods of highbinder?; it is i
what information h<? can get. Lieutenant
Prico had 'stool pigeons' In every soci
ety meeting ;>nd always knew just what to |
do. Now ho is gone and th^ highbinders
Will bo happy. A great many of them
have loft the city, but they will be back
in a short time and we will have he old
trouble over again. If a minder is com
mitted tho white men should not now
Warn* the Chineseâ they should blame
themselves, for they have taken aw.-.y the
only man who can keep the bad element
in check."

GETTING READY FOR
THE MAY DOG SHOW
ENTRIES ARE POURING IN TO
THE SECRETARY.
The Champion St. Bernard Le Prince
Jr. Will Be Among the Aristo
cratic Canines on Ex
hibition.
The Pan Francisco Kennel Club is mak
ing very elaborate preparations for its
inaugural bench show, which will be held
In Mechanics' Pavilion in May. Entries
for the show are coming in to the -
tary at 23S Montgomery street so fast that
on closing night all records, so far as
Pan Francisco is concerned, are expected
to be lowered.
The owners of Pt. Bernards, mastiffs,
collies, fox terriers nnd greyhounds are
taking deep interest in the success of the
show, which at this early date augurs a
grent success. The judge, Mr. Lacey, Is
;â  the best all-round judges in the
country, and his selection meets with the
approval of all those Interested in kennel
affairs.
L. A. Klein, who is looking after the
interests of the. champion St. Bernard.
!.<â¢ Prince Jr., is expected to reach this
next week with the famous St. Ber
nard and also several other high-class
some of which will doubtless bo ex
â¢ rh" Show. The owner of The
Prince, F. Bushnell, has about decided to
enter his charge for exhibition only. He
thinks that in justice to the owners of
St. Bernards here it would not be right
on his part to enter a dog that has de
feated many Eastern champions for com
petition against local kennels. Mr. Bush
nell acknowledges, however, that among
the St. Bernards on this coast he can
name quite a few of the smooth-coats
who are dangerous competitors in any
kind of company.
As "the woods are full" of greyhounds
a large representation of longtails is said
show is expected. Judge Lacey is said
to be Â» lover of the greyhound and also a
man who thoroughly understands their
defects and good qualities.
Among the entries already received are:
Five pups out of Mrs. .1. P. Norman's mas
tiff bitch, Lola, now deceased. These pups
are Don Montez (49.845), owned by H. B. Lin
coln; W. H. Dick's BuÂ»no Montez (61.10R);
Duncan Murray's Northman Montez (50,365),
and J. P. Norman's Ix>la Montez (51,109).
Dr. Fred \V. d'Evelyn will exhibit his Im
ported fox terrier Defender.
H. A. Werner has â¢ offered a magnificent
trophy for cocker spaniels, and will make a
gallant effort to .win it with the team of six
spaniel*, that may. be seen In Golden Gate
Park every day drawing his little girl's wagon.
The St. Bernard Club Will make 150 entries
to-day, and all owners of large dogs should
not delay In following this example, as extra
large kennels will be provided for all large
dogs. If the club receive the entries in time
to make the necessary arrangements.
Ry special permission of the American
Kennel Club, accorded In consideration of
the time consumed in applying to New
York for registration and receiving the
return, the San Francisco Kennel Club
Is now able to receive applications and
owners, hy paying the fee of $1 here, can
avoid the payment of the listing fee.
J. B. Thompson of Irvington has in this
way registered and entered no less than
seven St. Bernard puppies.
The Pacific special committee of the
American Kennel Club will meet to-night
at the Occidental Hotel. The meeting has
j been called by Dr. W. R. Cluness Jr., who
is acting chairman in the absence of John
E. de Ruyter. One of the subjects will be j
the consideration of the proposed new |
rule of the American Kennel Club to class
ify the different shows according to the
number of d"Bs shown. A win in the win- '
ners' class would count in proportion to I
the importance of the show. Ten points |
would be required to make a champion. ;
New York and San Francisco would be :
arbitrarily designated as five-point shows,
shows with 760 dogs and over as four
point shows, between 500 and 7"iO dogs as I
three-point shows, between 250 and sfÂ»o
dogs as two-point shows and under 250
doga as one-point shows. This change I
s.-.-ms to meet with general approval, as !
tending to differentiate the wins of small
nt.d large shows, without injustice to
â¢ ither,. and. it is confidently expected that
the American Kennel Club's special com
mittee will indorse the proposal to-night.
The following letter from the. secret,) rv
of the Pacific Kennel League has been re
ceived and, of course, &pe.aks for Itself:
Fportlng; Editor San Francisco Call.â Dear
Sir; Inasmuch as the announcement of the
Pan Francisco Kennel Club Is misleading to
the public, I wish to state, through your
paper, that the wins at the Pan Francisco
show will not be recognized "all over the
country." The fact U, they will not be

recognized as wins and cannot appear In the
catalogues of any of the shows held on the
Pacific Coast under the P. K. L. rules.
I make this statement by "rdsr of tie pxpcu
tive committee of the Pacific Kennel League,
so that the "fancy" may nut be deceived.
Yours obediently,

DEATH SUMMONS
ANOTHER PIONEER
Jeremiah J. Desmond Found Dead
in His Apartments at Hotel
Marguerite.
Jeremiah J. Desmond, one of the oldest
and best-known insurance men of San
Francisco, died Wednesday night of apo
plexy at his apartments in the Hotel
Marguerite, 511 Turk street. At first it
was thought that his death was due to
accidental asphyxiation, but an investi
gation of the circumstances proved this.
to be untrue. It was Mr. Desmond's cus
tom to retire every night about 11 o'clock
and to rise in the morning at 8 o'clock for
the purpose of reading his morning paper
in bed. Yesterday the Japanese Bervant
who is employed at the Marguerite noticed
that the paper was outside of the door,
and when he attempted to open the door
for the purpose of taking the paper Into
the room he found It locked. His atten
tion was next attracted by the odor of
gas. W. H. Powers, the manager of the
hotel, was notified. He gained an entrance
' to the room and found the body of Mr.
Iâ â  mond <m the floor. Death had evi
dently ensued several hours before, as
the remains were cold and stiff. Powers
ires that there, was not enough gas
in th* room to have caused death. Ihe
key to the gas Jet was only partially
turned.
Mr. Desmond was an old man and very
stout. He was inclined to anoplexv, and,
in fact, for several days he ha<s been
complaining of dizziness. The supposition
Is that he whs suddenly attacked In tnei
night and that he attempted to rise and
turn on the gas, and that he was over
come before he could do so. None of his
family nor any of the, employes of the
hou'l know of any reason why Mr. Des
mond should desire to commit suicide.
When he retired Wednesday night he was
apparently in the best of health and spir
its. Dr. w. P. Chalmers, the State Quar
antine Officer, who is a nephew of the de
j ceased, and Coroner Hill, believe that the
: death was accidental. Dr. Chalmers noti
fied Mr. Desmond's family of his death.
I They were at his country home near Wal
j nut Creek, in Contra Costa' County. Mrs.
Desmond and. her sons, Henry and Paul,
reached the city yesterday afternoon and
took charge of the remains, which were.
I removed to undertaking parlors, where
! the autopsy was held. The deceased also
leaves one other son. William Desmond.
In addition to the immediate family Mr.
Desmond is survived by his sisters, Mrs.
Mary D. Chalmers and Mrs. Honora Law
: ler, and a brother, C. Desmond, of this
; city. There Is also another brother resid
ing in Los Angeles. The funeral will take
place to-morrow and the remains will be
temporarily Interred In Calvary Cemetery,
in the nlat of Paul Desmond.
The deceased was 71 yea.rs of age and a
native of Treland. He came to this coun
try when a young man and located In
Massachusetts, where he married. About
thirty years ago he moved with his fam
ily to Pan Francisco. He is well remem
bered a~ one of the early pioneer retail
merchants of this city. With his brother,
C. Desmond, he conducted for a number
of years a large hat store at the corner
of New Montgomery and Market streets.
He next engaged In the fire Insurance
business, with which he has been identi
fied ever since up to the time of his death.
j During his life Mr. Desmond represented
i a number of largo insurance companies,
among them being the Lancashire Fire
Insurance Company. He at one time also
represented several French companies.
Mr. Desmond was at his office on

TWO ATTEMPTS
TO BURN DOWN
GROCERY STORE
Both Happen Within
a Week.
WORK OF AN INCENDIARY
FIRE MARSHAL TOWE MAKES A
THOROUGH INVESTIGATION.
Suspicion Rests Upon the Proprietor,
but the Evidence Is Not Suffi
cient to Warrant an
Arrest.
Two suspicious fires within a w*ek at
dmrles Dohnken's grocery, 434 Green
wich street, have been investigated by
Fire Marshal Towe, and although he has
not secured sufficient evidence to cause
an arrest he is morally certain that the
fires were of incendiary origin.
Tuesday, April 11, about 5:30 o'clock in
the muring, tire was noticed in a vacant
room in the rear of the grocery and the
flames were extinguished by the ntghbors
before much damage was done. The Fire
Marshal made an investigation and cams
to the conclusion that boys or tramps had
caused the fire.
Tuesday night shortly before midnight
fire was again discovered at the grocery
on the outside wall on Telegraph place,
the building being on the corner. Dohnken
sleeps in a room in the rear and the young
I man who discovered the fire awoke him j
! and together they put out the names. The
weatherboards where the lire was started
were burned, and it was found that sacks
taturated with coal oil had been placed
against the weatherboards and set on lire.
[naide the store on the opposite side of the
weatherboards was a twenty-live-gallon
coal "il lank, which contained a quantity
of oil. If the flames bad reached it the
place would have been destroyed.
When the second lire was reported to the
Fire Marshal yesterday morning he de
cided that something was wrong, and "ii
making an investigation he found that
coal oil had been used to start the lire
and pieces of sacks saturated with the oil
.â till there. A heavy trail of oil
leading from the tank through the front
ot the store to where the lire was
started was plainly discernible.
August Wc-imann and family live in the
flat above the .store, and W'eimann told
the Fire Marshal that lie was awakened
by the noi.se. Ho went downstairs, and l
when Jio saw the sacks saturated with
coal oil he accused Dohnken of trying to
burn him ami his family alive. There is
a trap door leading from the rear of the
'Â. tht> second story, which was al

NEILL AND TRACEY
ROUNDING INTO FORM
BOTH MEN ARE TRAINING HARD
FOR THEIR BATTLE.
Lively Interest Being Manifested in
the "Goes" to Be Pulled Off by
the Western Club.
On Saturday morning: the. advance Palo
of reserved seats for the boxing show to
be held under the auspices of the West
ern J-toxing Club on Tuesday evening next
will be opened at 730 Market street, and,
judging by the interest shown by lovers
of the fistic game, there will be a big de
mand for coupons of admission. Numer
ous requests have hf-en made by Manager
Long of the pi 'pnlar club to dispose of
choice sections near the ringside, but the
latter has decided to wait and give every
one an equal chance.
The interest <>f the sporting public is
due to the good reports received daily
from the training quarters of Tracey and
Neiil and the other fighters. The men
who are to appear In "the event of the
evening" are already In. excellent shape
and when they enter the arena on Tues
day night should be in condition to make
a hard battle. Tracey's long experience
has taught him not to weigh the chances
of his opponent too cheaply. Knowing
Neill to be aggressive, a hard hitter and
a clever boxer, he is losing no opportunity
in preparing himself for the battle. He
remembers thai -McConnell made a finn
showing against himself and be saw bow
cleverly Neill handled the product of th>-
San Francisco Athletic flub.
Hundreds r>f ri^ht followers are confi
dent that Neill will take the Australian's
measure. They base their judgment on
his youth and on the fine showing he has
heretofore made, and intend backing him
heavily. Neill Is an aspiring fighter, and
knowing as he does that a victory over
Tracey will at one leap bring him "in the
front rank of the welter-weights, he will
in;<ke even,- effort to wtn. On Saturday
evening the managers of both men will
meet and choose a referee. The club will
furnish a referee for the other bouts
The interest in the fight between Lawler
and Denny is second to that taken in the
Mr go. Lawler's aggressiveness and clev
erness have won him a host of admirers,
and they will back him heavily to heat
Denny. The Australian has won fame
on his native heath, and does not intend
returning, as did Tweedle. with a black
mark on his record. He |b a hard puncher,
and those who have seen him perform
know that he is up to all the tricks of the
game.
Otts and Johnson should put up an ex
cellent preliminary. TJoth boys are fast
and clever and arÂ« the leaders In their
class. Otts showed in his last fipht that,
he can administer stiff punches. Johnson's
easy victory over .lean Mulligan has at
tracted a large following to his standard
and he will probably he made favorite.
Manager Long has matched his men with
rare judgment, and as a result the bet
ting public is assiduously studying the
"dope book" with a view of picking the
winners of the different events.

we befieve that every person of the thousands upon thousands who have read our

"mother," "the home" and those near and dear to us: we have built up this huge
business through carefully catering to the economical side of housekeeping :
that's probably why folks speak of Hale's as "the store mother likes": another
one spoke of Hale's as "whole families trade there!" yet with all our
care we have (owing to lack of space) had, more or less, to neglect some
branches of retailing, among them suits for children from 2 to 5 years of age:
this is now remedied : this advertisement tells you some of the lines we now offer.

GAMBLERS FIGHT HARD
TO OVERRIDE THE LAW
FURTHER HEARING OF THE
RACETRACK CASE.
; Proceedings Dragging Along in Con
sequence of the Tactics of the
Attorney for the De
fense.
The admission In evidence of the ordi
nance passed by the Supervisors last
March was the net result of yesterday's
proceedings In the pult In entity of the
Pacific Coast Jockey Club versus Chief of
Police Lees and his subordinates tn pro
hibit them from enforcing the law and
prohibit gambling at the racetrack. At
torney Aon, for the gamblers, objected to
everything in sight. John A. Hosmer.
who is conducting the case on behalf of
the department, grew weary; Judge Mur
asky was overcome with ennui, and so
was everybody elsf> In the courtroom;
but Ach kept on plugging in his objec
tions up to me time of adjournment.
During the morning Secretary Green
was reealled'and testified to the loss sus
tained by the club owing to the suppres
sion of gambling.
One of the points raised by Ach In the
case is that the police acted without au
thority, as the ordinance was not the law
in fact. In the afternoon I Former sum
moned John A. Russell, clerk of the
Board of Supervisors, and more than an
hour was consumed in getting- the simple
fact before the court that the order had
been regularly passed by the board. Ach
objected to everything. He objected to
the order itself, the method of its passage,
the signatures attached to it. the manner
In which it is kept in the clerk's office,
the means of publication, and only him
self knows what else. If there had been
as much trouble in getting the order
through the board as there was in getting
it before the court, the touts and gamhlers
would still be holding high carnival at
Ingleside.
When finally Clerk Russell was per
mitted to escape. Chief Lees was called
to the stand, and told, amid the usual
storm of objections, of the occurrences
at Ingleside on March 14. when the first
raid was made. The Chief finally lost
patience at Ach's endless interruptions
and Ignoring him and his objections alto
gether, described the entry of the police,
their descent upon the pool boxes, the lo
cation of the latter, the jeers of the touts,
etc. He had not finished his testimony
when court adjourned until this morning.
