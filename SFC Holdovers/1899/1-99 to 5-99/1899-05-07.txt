of March 28, 1899, that on March

fer with Mr. Orelllma as to the best
means for simultaneously attacking'

On arriving at the town of Mohosa
Eguino demanded a loan of 200 bolivars
from the priest of the town and 100
bolivars from the Mayor. These de
mands being refused the priest and the
Mayor were imprisoned. Meanwhile,
however, the priest had dispatched
couriers to the Indian villages, asking
that the natives attack Pando'a men.
A large crowd of Indians came, and in
spite of all measures taken to pacify
them the arms of 103 soldiers were
taken away, the men subjected to re
volting treatment and finally looked
inside the church for the ni;rht. In the
morning the priest, after celebrating
the so-called "mass of agony," allowed
ill" Indians to take out th<? unfortunate
victims, two by two, and deliberately
murder them, each pair by different
tortures. The other seventeen escaped
death by having departed the day pre
vious on another mission.
Each day brings news of risings of
the Indians in different sections of the
northern part of the country. A large
party of whites arrived in La Paz to
day, fleeing from the Indians.

REV. DR. HALE
HOTLY SCORES
PRESBYTERIANS
Says Their Church Is Lib
erty's Greatest Foe in
This Country.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 6.â A Chicago spe
rial to the Herald says: Rev. Dr. Ed
ward Everett Hale looks upon the
i; . shyterian church as the greatest
y of freedom in America. In its
organization and doctrines the eminent
i xjm nent of Unitarianisrn llnds a
menace to free institutions.
Dr. Hale proclaimed his antagonism
io thai church this afternoon at a
luncheon given in his honor by the
Unitarian Club and spoke in no uncer
tain words when attacking the tenets
of Presbyterianism. While commenting
on the growth of liberal religious
thought Dr. Hale remarked:
"In it.s strict organization and .teach
ings I look upon the Presbyterian
church as the greatest enemy of free
doro in America. Its whole tendency
is un-American and opposed to liberty
of thought and expression. It places
an ecclesiastical control over its mem
bers from which there is no escape ex
cept out of the doors of the church.
Once a man is chosen an elder or min
ister he is elected for the remainder of
his life."
Dr. Hale's address was an impromptu
one and the reference to the Presby
terian church, was merely incidental to
his remarks on the growth of liberal
religious belief in America since the
landing of the Puritans.

MERRIAM
SCORES THE
LABORERS
General Would Make the
Formation of Unions
a Crime.
TALKS AT WARDNER
i
Attributes the Riots to the Fact
That tha Men Are Per
mitted to Organize.
-
General Merriam has been do
ing some talking since his arrival
with United States troops to sup
press the strike at the Wardner
mines, ana yesterday ventured the
suggestion that, inasmuch as
troubles oi that character orig
inated with labor organizations,
there should be passed a law
making the formation of such
societies a chime.
Special Dlspat.h to The Call.
WARDNER, Idaho., May 6.â The first
step toward removing the county
officials of Shoehone County who are
accused of being in sympathy with the
rioters was taken 1 .-day by tlit- State,
assisted by United States ti'oops, when
Sheriff James D. Young- and County '
Commissioner William Boyle were ar
rested by order of State Auditor Sin
clair, who represents Governor Steun
enberg, in Shoshone County. Sheriff j
Young and Commissioner Boyle were
placed in the stockade with the 300 oth
er prisoners. Proceedings for the re
moval of these officials from office will i
be commenced on the ground that they
aided and abetted the riot last Satur
day. Coroner France, by statutory
regulation, becomes acting Sheriff.
The trial of those accused of murder i
Â«tnd riot will, in all probability, be held
.at Walla'-'*-, the county seat of Sho- j
shone County Uniteil Btates troops i
have takeneharge of the office -"id safe
of the Burke Miners' Union, and when
the safe is opened the Federal officials
expect to find '-criminating evidence!
against some of the leaders who are ab- ,
sent from the State. .
Citizens and business men here are'
almost unanimous in favor of theestab
lishment of a military post in the Coeur
d'Alene district as a means of protec- j
tion against the riotous element, but
General Merriam believes the State au
thorities should provide protection for
mine owners. , ."
General Merriam said there were
grave difficulties in the way of estab
lishing a permanent military post here.
The constitution of the United States
did not contemplate that the Federal
Government should intervene in State
affairs until the State had exhausted
every resource of self-protection. In
deed, were the post here the situation
would not be materially changed, Cor
the soldiers would b<- powerless to move
against tho rioters until authorized by
the President on request of the Gov
ernor. With garrisons at Spokane,
Helena, Fort Sherman and perhaps
Missoula, troops could be crowded in
here almost as rapidly as if they were
on the ground and the time gained by
having the post here would be slight.
"When the request came for troops this
time the soldiers were rushed here at
once. That they were not here in time
to avert loss of life and property is the
fault of the Governor, who failed to
call for troops until the damage had
been done.
The same condition would exist were
a permanent <>ost here. Until the Gov
ernor called for their aid, the soldiers
would be powerless. It is the fault of
the State that she was not ready to
give protection to her citizens against
such outrages as these. She should
have militia to cope with such out
breaks. When the National Guard from
Idaho went to the war the militia
should have been reorganized so that
it would still be ready for such trouble.
The laxity which has prevailed in the
prosecution of murderers who have in
fested this district would soon be reme
died should the State pass a law for
indemnity from the State funds of
$10,000 to the family of every man killed
in a riot. The law might also provide
-that owners of property destroyed by
mobs should be reimbursed to the
amount of its full value by the State.
Payment of a few such awards would
soon bring the people to a sense of the
crimes being perpetrated here. At the
same time since the trouble largely
originated in hostile organizations of
men known as labor unions he would
suggest a law making the formation
of such unions or kindred societies a
crime.
POPE'S CONFIDENCE
IN HIS LONGEVITY
An Interesting Anecdote Related by
a South American Church
Dignity.
NEW YORK, May Â«.â A cable to the
World from Paris says: Stories Illustrat
ing the Pope's confidence in his longevity
are numerous. The latest is given by
Monsignor Casanova, a South American
church dignitary, as he was passing
through here to Rome. Monwignor Cas
anova was in Rome ten years ago and
before leaving paid a farewell visit to the
Pope.
"You seem to be agitated, my son," said
Leo XIII to him.
"Holy Father, it is because I am won
dering whether I Â»hall ever have the joy
of seeing you again," he replied.
"Why not?" said the Pope. "You are
still young, and it is to be hoped will be
able to return to us once affain."
M. FREYCINCT
HAS RESIGNED
M. CAMILLE KRAUNTZ, the New French
Minister of War.
The French Minister of
War Feared the Coming
Dreyfus Trial.
PARIS. May ij.â M. Charles de- Freycinet tv-day tendered his resig
nation of the War portfolio to M. Dupuy, the Premier. M. Dupuy
Immediately summoned a meeting of the Cabinet, which M. de
Freycinet did not attend. At the conclusion of the Cabinet meet
ing M. Dupuy had a conference with President Loubet with the
result that M. Camille Krauntz. at present Minister of Public Works,
was appointed to succeed M. de Freycinet. Senator Monestier has been
selected as Minister of Public Works.
M. Camille Krauntz. the new Minister of War, said in the course of
an interview to-day that he fully realizes the difficulties surrounding- the
office to which he has been ai>p->in ti-d, but he declared that he had a
perfectly open mind with reerard to the Dreyfus affair. He never had
been connected with the affair.
It is understood that M. Krauntz will clean his department of every
one who was mixed in any wav with Dreyfus.
M. de Freycinet's resignation was a grreat surprise to French politi
cians, but it is the general imnres-\sion that he was anxious to escape a
probable debate in the near future.

ture conferences may pave the way for
getting an understanding among man

Professor Yon Esmarch says of per
petual peace: "I hold it as impossible
that a general disarmament of the
powers should be reached. It seema to
me unlikely at all events. Germany
should not begin until her neighbors,
also England and the United States

SANTA CRUZ
BUILDING
ON FIRE
Odd Fellows' Magnificent
Block in the Grasp of
Flames.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ. May 6.â The Odd Fel
lows' building, one of the finest blocks
in town, is burning. Fire started |n the
south end of the building and an alarm
was turned in shortly before 12 o'clock.
Flames leaped high and clouds of
smoke issued from the stores below and
from every window. â  The fire gained
steady headway and soon the interior
of the building on the second floor was
a raging furnace. Men worked hard to
save the paraphernalia and regalia of
the many lodges which meet in this
building.
The (Md Fellows' building is worth
$40,000, with insurance of $17,000. The
greatest loss is in the paraphernalia
used in the secret work of the orders
which met there â the Odd Fellows, Re
bekahs, Ancient Order of United Work
men, Portuguese Union, Italian Benev
olent Society and Knights of Pythias.
The lodgeroom is considered the best
in the State, being one of the largest
and best equipped. The loss is es
pecially hard on the Knights of Pyth
ias, whose State Grand Lodge is soon
to meet here. All the sessions were to
have been held in this building.
The largest loser of the business firms
is I. Fleisig, who carried an immense
stock of clothing and furnishing goods.
It is almost a complete loss. His in
surance is $9000. John Brazer, the pio
neer stationer of the city, who carries
stationery, books and fancy goods, is
a heavy loser. He carried several thou
sand dollars insurance. Bixby Bros.'
drugstore is greatly damaged by break
age and water. Their insurance is
about $2000.
On the upper floor are the offices of
Dr. B. A. Plant and Dr. C. W. Doyle,
and the dental parlors or Dr. Drullard.
The Knights of Pythias have suc
ceeded in saving most of their para
phernalia.

Peace in the Philippines Is
Believed to Be in

A MATTER OF HOURS
The Admiral Is Wanted to Give
His Advice to President
McKinley.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 6.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the
Herald telegraphs: Official in
timations have been received by the
President that Admiral Dewey de
sires to return home as soon as peace
negotiations with the insurgents are
concluded.
This statement, made to me to-day
by a nigh administration official, con
firms the Herald's announcement of
the prospective early return of the
admiral. As it is the expectation of
the administration that peace in the
archipelago is merely a question of
hours, it is apparent that Ad \iral
Dewey will soon be on his way home.
Admiral Dewey has not asked to
be recalled. In President Schur
man's dispatch received at the State
Department yesterday, however, his
home-coming was alluded to and
! reference was made to the desire of
the commission that he should see
the President and explain the situa
tion to him, as the admiral is a mem
! ber of the commission.
Secretary Long could not tell me the
method of procedure which will be fol
lowed in the matter of the admiral's
recall. It is expected, however, that
Rear Admiral Watson will be sent to
Manila in a few days, dependent, of
course, on the progress of the peace
negotiations and that the admiral will
then be granted permission to return
to the United States.
He will be directed to come in one of
the ships under his command, in all
! probability his flagship, the Olympia,
and he will undoubtedly return through
the Suez canal so as to touch at New
' Yurk.
It requires about forty-five days to
make the voyage from Manila to New
York, and officials do not expect the
admiral will reach this country much
before July or August, although as in
dicated, everything is dependent upon
the rapidity with which the peace ne
gotiations are concluded. President
McKinley will be glad to talk with the
admiral regarding the Philippine situa
tion. Before Dewey's departure from
Manila it is expected he will go over
the work of the commission in order
that he may be able to present the
views of his colleagues as well as his
own to President McKinley.
When he has concluded his confer
ence with the President, the admiral
will be given a long rest and then such
duty as he may desire.
President McKinley has expressed to
friends his firm conviction that the
Filipino insurrection will collapse with
in the next forty-eight hours. This
conclusion is based upon highly satis
factory cablegrams received from Mr.
Schurman, president of the Peace Com
mission, an outline of which was pub
lished in the Herald this morning.
Another conference between the
Peace Commission and Aguinaldo's
representatives is probably now or
soon will be in progress, the result of
which President McKinley believes will
be the decision of the Filipinos to lay
down their arms as a preliminary to
the inauguration of the form of gov
ernment which the Peace Commission
has recommended, and which the Pres
ident has approved.
In view of the auspicious outlook for
an early peace, it is thought in some
quarters to be rather strange that the
American forces continue fighting.
When I asked a high official of the ad
ministration for an explanation of this
apparent incongruity, he declared that
vigorous measures were necessary until
peace had become an accomplished
fact.
"The trouble all along has been," he
said, "that Aguinaldo's army has mis
understood our efforts at conciliation.
Every act of kindness has been con
sidered by Aguinaldo as an evidence of
weakness, and he would invariably fol
low all peaceful overtures by orders for
increasing the strength of his intrench
ments. The members of the Peace
Commissionâ civilians as well as the
military membersâ have all agreed that
the best means for securing a speedy
termination of the rebellion is to keep
hitting hard while the enemy is re
volving in his mind the conditions upon
which ho can have peace.
"Our information, however, justifies
the belief that there will be a cessation
of hostilities within less than forty
eight hours."
The form of government which the
Peace Commissioners have recom
mended has been the principal topic in
official quarters here to-day. Comment
is generally favorable. Even the anti
expansionists have little fault to find
with it. They declare that anything is
better than a military form of govern
ment, and even if the substitute pro
posed by the commissioners does not
contemplate ultimate independence for
the Filipinos it will be more in keeping
with our institutions to control the
archipelagcr through the civil than
through a military government.

Have been out two months or more. I

try that has game. I have seen nothing
for days, only rough mountains and sand
and little water.
June Struck a trail. Will follow it
up. Indians, I think, but anything is bet

water. They do nut talk any lingo I can

June 10â Start on tramp again. Indians
say by signs white men eight sleeps from
here south.
June 12â In crossing mountains I found
a fine ledge of gold ore very rich. "Will
prospect some to-day, as there are water
and grass about three miles from the gold
mine.
June 13â Have taken out . some gold,
probably forty or more ounces. Leave to
morrow and try to find some camp where
I can get some, supplies. Leave marks to
find mine again if we get out alive. Men
will do much for gold. Have left this in
a pile of rock about one mile south of the
mine. From the spring the mine bears
north by west. Should 1 not get out of
this and this is found I would like the

rock upon a point of a mountain. I leave
some samples of ore -in th.c can with this.
I have marked rocks along the route from

pray J may live to get out of this.

Poor Bob, good-by.
The predicament of Bates after his
only companion had met his death can
be appreciated by those who have been
similarly situated. The writer of that
diary evidently did not escape with his
life.
Burlingham, who is an old-timer,
says he has never yet gone on a search
for the elusive and still lost Pegleg
mine, but he is going to Ballarat and
will try to rediscover the claim of Wil
liam Bates. If anything comes of it
the surviving heirs of that prospector
of 1862 will stand a chance of winning.

Combines.
NEW YORK, May fi.â The Herald
will print the following to-morrow:
Scarcely anything is being done by any
of the States from the Atlantic to the
Pacific to cure the formation <>f trusts.
These great aggregations of money are
sweeping over the country, absorbing
every known interest. At the rate the
concentration is progressing individual
effort or ownership will, in a few years,
be a ihing of the past. Attorney Gen
eral Griggs, a few months ago, d â 
. dared that the Federal Government
could only take cognizance of such
trust? as were interstate in their oper
ations and effect, and thai the chief
I remedy lay in the Slates themselves.
Sentiment in the State L"K ; sl.-uures,
at th> Ir most recent sessions, is appar
-1 ently more in favor >>f the trusts than
in opposition. The proposition to have
Southern Legislatures put the trust is
| sue to the front. In order to disconcert
! Bryan, has not worked well. One after
another they are adjourning without
I doing anything. The bars seem to be
down almost everywhere.
The Herald has received replies from
its correspondents in thirty-two States
regarding the attitude of their com
monwealths toward trusts and com
binations of .capital.
The :â¢ plies show this result: States
that have newly amended their anti
trust laws in an effort to make them
operative, New York, North Carolina
and Minnesota, three. States that are
contemplating more stringent anti
trust legislation, Arkansas, one. States
in which old laws are being enforced,
Georgia, Indiana, Kansas. Texas and
Ohio, five. States in which there are
no laws, or in which laws are not en
forced, Connecticut, Colorado, Florida,

that are supposed to favor trusts. New

In North Carolina and Minnesota the
laws that have been passed are new

are harmless. In New York the law
h.as been changed t" enable the At

the law In Texas, Kansas and Ohio bids
fair to be effe< tive.
In Indiana the law is about to be

CHICAGO, May 6.â Behind the bars of
the Chicago avenue station Captain
George Wellington Streeter and th<- re
mainder of the government of the "Dis
trict of Lake Michigan" to-day hurled
defiance at the police until friendly pow
ers bailed them out. The capture of the
government and the dispersal of its
forces was accomplished in the morning
by Inspector Max Heldelmeler and a hun
dred uniformed policemen without the loss
of a man. although the warlike King of
the .iist riot had threatened with instant
death any one who ventured to dispute
his power of authority over the 18>j acres
ol royal dumpage bordering on the lake
at the foot of Superior street.
History was made rapidly to-day in

storm of 1886 he proved to bo even greater
in defeat. Packed like sardines in one vC

People in tile, vicinity of Superior street
will long remember the memorable scenes
which were enacted about the capital of
the District of Lake Michigan this morn
ing. The royal palace is nothing more
than a board shanty with a flagstaff on
the roof, but it represented the acme of
King George's ideas ana the principles for
which he stands. Beneath the folds of
the Hay winch the captain raised over
the building lie and his followers basked
in the free atmosphere of a miniature re
public seeking annexation to the United
Stat es.
Early in the morning- Inspector Heidel
im-ier and Captain Revere, alter a con
sultation with Assistant Chief of Police
Lewis, Acting Corporation Counsel
Browning, Detectives i-'itzgerald, Early
and Thompson, and Attorney W. S. For
est, at the City Hall, decided that the
District of Lake Michigan must be over
thrown. Kellogg Falrbank, as rcpr senta

short.- of the lake, also was there. Acting
Corporation Counsel Browning was -

was nut making a disturbance, believing
it was a question for the courts to settle.
However, Acting Chief Lewla ordered an

Inspector Heideimeler at once repaired
to headquarters and ordered his forces to
prepare for battle. At '.'..<> his army
was drawn up, and, commanded by Cap

march down Chicago avenue began. He

for Inspector Heidelmeier and bis men.
The inspector was, as usual, Impassive

might confront him, but not tor an in

they had been outnumbered ten to one.
About the capital of the .District of
Lake Michigan ail was quiet, although
advance guards and scouts informed
King George that the enemy was advanc

throne in front of the royal door with a
c >!l gleam In his eye. His attitude was
that of a man who recognized a crisis
was before him, but was resolved to face
it t" tti'- bitter end. As a crisis facer
Streeter has no equal. He has faced
about a thousand in his day.
His thirty-five followers, comprising
citizens of the district and office-holders,
w^Ti- deployed about the grounds, keep
ing vigilant watch of everything that
went on. No one of the mob which was
regarding proceedings from the outside
trocha was permitted -within, as King
George was determined not to be cap
tured through treachery.
Those of his followers who were not
employed on guard duty were within the
palace eating cold ham and hard-boiled
eggs and drinking coffee. The captain had
told lifs Bubjects he did not believe
any one could win a battle upon an empty
Btomach. Many of the men carried weap
ons buckled about their waists. From
tiiri" to time the crowned head threw out
words of cheer to his men to keep their
spirits up.
"We're here to stay," he said.
Cheers followed his remark.

DESIRELLO JURY
FAILS TO AGREE
Murder Trial Comes to
Naught.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDWOOD CITY, May 6.â After be
ing out for three hours the jury in the
Desirello murder trial failed to agree
and was discharged by the court. This
means that the whole affair will have
to be rehearsed again in another trial.
At a few moments before 3 o'clock
this afternoon the court had completed
its instructions to the jury, which re
tired to the jury-room in charge of the
Sheriff. The first ballot, it is under
stood, resulted in seven votes for con
viction and five for acquittal. After
two hours' deliberation the jury was
brought into court to receive further
instructions on the question of man
slaughter. After another hour's delib
eration it could come to no agreement,
the vote standing six for manslaughter
and six for acquittal.
The defendant probably will be tried
anew very soon. All of next week will
be taken up in the trial of other crimi
nal rases, and after that the court
probably will set a day.
This morning the defense placed a
witness on the. stand to show that it
was customary for young Vacart, who
was driving the wagon on the night in
question, to drive at a rapid pace, and
that he was an incompetent driver.
The prosecution introduced testimony
to rebut this. District Attorney Bul
lock made a forcible argument against
Desirelio, and Mr. Walker spoke for an
hour in reply. In the afternoon Judg*
Fitzpatrick, one of the defendant's at
torneys, addressed the jury. Both at
torneys made Enlendld pleas for their
client.
The result of the second trial is
awaited with considerable interest
here, for the sister of Johnston, the
dead boy, has taken an oath to put a
bullet through Desirelio in the event
that he should escape punishment at
the hands of a jury. The wife and
father of Desirelio were in court all
day, as were the father, mother and
sister of. yoans James Johnston.
rest us. I don't object to an alliance, but
expansionâ no!"
Just then word came that the. enemy
was at hand, and the King issued hurried
orders to his men.
"Get hold of some papers and he read-
Ing them. I'll do the talking," was what
he .-aid.
The. men obeyed, such was their contt
dence in their leader. George I had hardly
seated himself on the porch of his capital
when the head of the column, under Cap
tnin Revere, halted before the liars
which separated the District of Lake
Michigan from the boundaries of the
United States. The inspector pushed
down the bars and with his men at In*
heels advanced upon the dump-heap mon
arch. Waving his club above his head
the inspector said:
"King Stteet,r. in the name of the peo
ple of the United States of America I
command you and your followers to dis
perse."
No bursting of bombs followed this ut
terance,- as some of the crowd had ex
pected. King Streeter replied:
"I have nothing to do with the United
States of America."
"Then, sir," Heidelmeier said, as he
showed his ignorance of court etiquette
ny rapping the royal beach with his billy,
"l place you under arrest."
"1 will not go unless 1 am carried." said
the monarch, "for the reason that I do
not acknowledge your authority to dis
turb us."
Fearing an attack the invading forces
then moved forward, while the Inspector
gave the command:
"Place every one of these men under ar
rest."
He made a leap forward ahd grabbed
the sovereign of the District or .Lake
Michigan by the collar of his royal robe
and started him on a run for a patrol
wagon. Captain Revere had meanwhile
collared H. N. James, Justice of the I lls
trlci Court, and was rapidly distancing
Heldelmeier and his charge for the same
goal.
The other police officers were actively
engaged In capturing the remainder of the
government, although about half of them
as Boon aa they saw the downfall of their
sire were rapidly making tracks. Being
surrounded by the polii â¢ about fifteen of
them wen gathered In and loaded into
the patrol wagon, together with King
( reorge.
About 1000 persons witnessed the battle
and the downfall of the government.
Many of them did not realize the signifi
cance of the event and Jeered at the royal
prisoner. Inside th^ wagon Sire, ter was
in unmeasured terms denouncing the in
spector, the Chicago police and every
ore who had had a hand in hie capture.
"I'll have you arrested and convicted
for kidnaping," was the threat hurled at
the inspector.
"If you don't keep quiet you'll gn into
the cooler as soon as l get you to thi
tlon," returned the victorious copper.
The threat had the elte, t of quelling the
prisoner and the rest of the kidi
government did not utter a sound.
The prisoners were booked on a charge
of unlawful assemblage, and the
probably will be heard on Monday morn
ing ; n the Chicago avenue Police Court.
Their arms were taken away from them,
and the gov< rnment was herded together
in one cell. Pacing up and down in his
contracted quarters, as all imprisoned
chiefs are said to do, George 1 reiterated
his threats to make the police suffer for
what they had done.
"They'll hear of this," he said, "as soon
as 1 get out. I'll show 'em a thing or two
about law. Why, that land don't any
mi r< i'l long to the State of Illinois or the
city of Chicago than Serry Leone or the
British West Indies. I discovered it and

thai we did not have anything to do
with it. and look what has been done, its
kidnaping, that's what it is, and they'll
know it when I get out."
"Yes," chimed In Chief Justice James.
"If there's any law in this country they'll
suffer. They can't come into another
country and take out its citizens without
authority. We're a government. They
can't get around it."
The capitoi of the District of Lake
Michigan was found to be well stored
with provisions and eatables, evidently
for the purpose of withstanding a siege.
The men who support King Streeter are
perfectly serious in the matter.
In 1886 the captain claims his boat was
wrecked at the foot of Superior street,
and by virtue of the shipwreck he dis
covered the soil. The captain says the
limits of the State of Illinois are not on
tlif shores of the lake, but are at a point
which ends at St. Clair street. The United
States, he says, never had any title to
the bottom of the lak<-. and therefore the
soil which comprises the District of Lake
Michigan was common property, subject
to the claims of any one who discovered
it and laid claim to it. Ho maintains he
did this, and about two months ago he
and other squatters got together,
adopted a constitution and laws and
elected officers. They forwarded peti
tions to Washington asking to be an
nexed to the L'nited States.
DEADLY TORNADO
HITS OKLAHOMA
Great Loss of Life Is
Reported.
WICHITA, Kan., May 7.â Meager re
ports reach here of a terrific windstorm
that caused great destruction at sev
eral points in Southern Oklahoma. The
most serious damage is reported at
Chickasha, Tongana and Anadarko.
The storm struck Chickasha at 3:30
o'clock in the afternoon and destroyed
that part of the town north of the Rock
Island railroad shops. Sixteen build
ings were blown down and the roof was
torn from the railroad roundhouse.
Sixteen injured persons had been taken
from the wrecks up to 6 o'clock, but
only one death had been reported. J.
H. Murray, a railroad man, was dead
when taken from the wreck of a
building.
Rumors of greater loss of life are
heard but cannot be confirmed. There
is only one telegraph wire out of Chick
asha, and there is little chance of get
ting a list of the Injured to-night.
The storm came from the southwest,
preceded by a heavy hail and followed
by a flood of rain. The path of the
storm was right down Chickasha ave
nue, the main street of the town, and
nearly every building on the street was
either wrecked or unroofed and the
contents exposed to the rain.
A dispatch received in Wichita from
Tongana says that at Canton Town
ship, eighteen miles west, great damage
was done by a tornado. The family of
J. 11. Ware took refuge in a storm cave,
which became so heavy from the con
stant rain that it fell in, killing three
members of the family. The houses of
J. F. Tounel and S. Saunders were
blown to pieces and Mrs. Tounel was
badly hurt.
of the damage at Anadarko nothing
car. be definitely learned. Tho Rock
Island extension up the Canadian Val
ley to Anadarko is reported washed oiit
in three places and traffic is blocked.
FAILS TO SETTLE
BUFFALO STRIKE
Carriers' Association Is
Denounced.
Special Dfsratch to The Call.
BUFFALO. May 6.â The Lake Car
riers' Association to-night abandoned Its
efforts to settle the dispul Con
tractor William J. Connors and
shoveters. The State Board of Mediation
and Arbitration will remain here for
some time to investigate the grain shov
eling business and ascertain what truth
there is in the charge made by the men
concerning the abuses of the contract sys
tem. The board, however, has lost hope
of ever being able to bring the contract
ors and the men together.
This hopeless situation was brought
about by the action of the striking Grain
Shovelers' Union- in rejecting the propo
sition submitted by a joint committee of
the State Board of Mediation and Arbi
tration and the Lake Carriers' As
sociation, the Elevator Association, the
Merchants" Exchange and the United
Trades and l^abor Council, and agreed to
by Mr. Connors. The proposition was the
result of a conference among tin- i
sentatlves of these organizations, which
lasted from 11 o'clock in the morning un
til late in the afternoon.
Contractor Connors was called b
the conference committee and requi
tf> state what concessions he would i
to the men. .Mr. Connors said ho v
do anything that was fair, but thai he
would refuse to abandon his contract in
compliance with the request of the
strikers.
At 8 o'clock to-night Mr. Connors
proposition in typewritten form was laid
before the grain-shovelers. At that time
2000 of them had assembled at their hall.
The proposition was to the â¢
Mr. Connors would agree to abolish the
saloon boss system; that dummies would
not be placed on the payroll; that a rep
resentative citizen of Buffalo would be
appointed with power to investigate all
complaints made by the men in future,
and tint the men would receive V 85 ! ;f - r
thousand bushels, which was the scale
fixed last year.
President McMahon declared, immedi
ately after reading the proposition, that
he rejected it and would refuse to sub
mit It to the men.
The committee of labor men who had
conferred with Connors and the board of
arbitration urged him to permit th< men
to vote on the proposition, but McMahon
refused. Instead, he walked to the fruit
of the stage and said:
"A fake proposition submitted
to us by the Lake Carriers' Association.
As it provides for a continuance of the
contract system I have rejected it in
yuur behalf."
The grain-shovelers cheered the an
nouncement enthusiastically. Prea
McMahon then announced that the men
would have no more to do -with th* ]>ake
Carriers' Association, but would tight the
matter out on the docks.
It was announced to-night that the
monthly men at the elevators and the
coalheavers on the docks would go out on
Mi nday. This will add nearly 2000 men
to the ranks of the strikers. Then is un
doubted evidence that men are to be
brought here by Mr. Connors from out
side towns, and if this is done serious
trouble is sure to follow.

Hawaii Will Be Overrun
by Asiatics.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, May 6.â Joshua K. Brown.
United States Chinese Inspector at Ha
waii, has made a report to the com
manding general of immigration relat
ing to the introduction <>i" Asiatic labor
into the islands, in the course of the
t he says the Executive Council
is now earnestly considering the ques
tion, both with ref >nee t<> the pres
ent needs of the islands in their rapidly
increasing agricultural developments
and as to the effect any attempt to
meet the increasing demands for labor
may have upon the future relations to
the "home government." This has re
sulted in a notice to the Planters'
elation thai some policy must be adopt
ed looking to tiio restriction to the pres
ent influx of assisted Asiatic laborers.
The public, Mr. Brown asserts, is
thoroughly Imbued with the idea that
th> large number <>t Japanese lal
- hi to the isiands since annexailnn
Llready aroused antagonism in the
d States, and that a continuance
of the policy will result in a colonial,
rather than in a territorial, form of
it for th.' islands. On the
hand, it is admitted th the ma
t. ii;<: prosperity of the country will be
seriously hindered, if foreign labor can
not be obtained for th.' b'rge areas >if
land now being ranidly brought under
cultivation.
The whole number of Japanese la
borers admitted to the island since an
nexation. Mr. Brown says, is 12.180. Of
this number 1197 were free, the only re
quirement being that each individual
shall or of $50 in gold or
its equivalent. The remaining 10,995
were contract labor >rs. These contracts
mply that th" laborer shall work
for the contractor three years on stip
ulated terms. At the end of that period
he is at liberty to remain in the country
or Uave it at his 0..j pleasure.
About half of the population, Mr.
Brown says, is Asiatic, and the number
of Japanese exri 'is the Chinese 'by
about 10,000. He predicts that before
the end of the present year the. Asiatic
lation of the islands v. .11 largely
exceed all other nationalities combined,
and the excess of Japanese over Chi
nese will be fully double what it is now.
DR. PARKER'S BITTER
REBUKE FOR WALES
NEW YORK. May 6.â A cable to the
Journal from London says: The invec
tive of Rev. Dr. Joseph i',s.rker of the
City Temple against Princes and. Prime
Ministers â¢â  horse races is con
i by English society as a slap in the
face to both rho Prince of Wales and
l."r<! Rosebery. When asked by the
Journal correspondent whom he meant.
Dr. Parker replied: "1 didn't refer per
sonally ii ely to the Prince of
. but 1 distinctly include all Princes
who have be< n setting a bad exam]
the people. ''
"What would you have thf Prince of
Wales do to be a g'Â«.;d example?" I>r.
Parker was as! â 
"What 1 would have him do would be
abstain from horse racing, gambling and
ichery."
It Parker despairs of English society.
H(- thinks it is sordid and sickening.
"I firmly believe," said he, "that we arp
on the brink of revolution. Things can
not possibly go on as they ape. If thp
Prince of Wales doesn't master his pas
sions and tread the virtuous path of his
illustrious mother when he comes to the
throne the crown of England won't be
worth a twelve months' purchase."

Affiliated College Not
Healthful.
DEAN ROASTS THE GOVERNOR
PRESENT QUARTERS ARE SMALL
BUT PREFERABLE.
Decision of the Faculty to Be Placed
Officially Before the Board
of Regents on Tuesday
Next.
The building in the Affiliated College
group set aside for the college of dentistry
is likely to remain tenantless for the next
two years unless some public-spirited cit- j
! lzen comes forward with a gift of $27,000, i
the sum necessary to complete the build
ing so it may meet with the approval of
| the faculty.
As the structure now stands the faculty
1 of the college of dentistry considers it a
; menace to the health of those who may
occupy it. and consequently has decided
not to endanger the lives of the students
by tiiki;:^ up their quarters there. A cess
pool within one hundred feet of the struc- I
ture that acts as a drain for the medical
, building Is the point of objection, and the
faculty, who in the matter of locating
college quarters are all-powerful, have :
declared thai until the sanitary arrange- I
tnents are of a quality to meet with their
approval the- college of dentistry will not
occupy the building set apari for its use.
i>r. Dunbar, dean of the faculty, was
nx.M ]iujgtiv< in his declaration that the
college of dentistry would not remove
from iis present quarters at the junction
of Markei and Taylor streets. "We are
cramped v.here we are." said the di tor,
"but the sanitary conditions of *>\iv quar
ters are above reproach. The matter of
choosing a building for the college <>f den
tistry is left entirely to the faculty, and
I we fiavi decided that until the* offensive
tool is a thing of the past we will
not take up our quarters there. The State

with robbing 1 his employers of several

For some time past suits of clothes and
other garments have been surreptitiously
taken from the store, and as Seamen was
suspected a strict watch was kept on
him. Despite the vigilance of the mem
bers of the firm, the wholesale thieving
continued, and It was finally decided to
notify the police. Detectives Ryan and
ODea were detailed to locate the culprit.
and by dint of Inquiry among the other
employes of the company they became
convinced that Segen was the thief.
Shortiy before noon yesterday they saw
Segen leaving the ston with h package
under his arm. They followed him to his
room at 415 Mason street, where lie left
th<> package and at once returned to the
store. Shortly after he had disappeared

CRUSHED TO DEATH IN
A MINING INCLINE
a m ARKLEY FARISH. the talent
jm^B e<i son of A. L. Farish, chief
I^Brl deputy in thf office of United
I T I States Marshal Shine, was in
stantly killed yesterday morn-
Ing by an accident in the Dutch mine,
Tuolumne County. The young man
was only 22 years old and graduated
from Berkeley last year, having com
pleted a course of study designed to
lit him for the profession of v mining
engineer and expert. In order to ob
tain that intimate practical knowledge
of the details of his chosen profession
young Farish about three months ago
went to work in the Dutch mine on
Quartz Mountain, near Jimtown. His
uncle, John B. Farish of Denver, Is
one of the best known mining experts
in the United States, and it was chiefly
the fame acquired by his uncle that
bent his inclination to that profession.
The brief dipatch announcing the
melancholy news of the death of the
young engineer was received at the
office of United States Marshal Shine
yesterday afternoon. It stated that at 3 o'clock in the morning young Farish,
while on the 300-foot level, made a misstep and fell backward into the in
cline shaft. Eight feet below the spot from which the fÂ«tal plunge had been
made the body of the unfortunate youth struck the skip which was being
hoisted with a load of water, and between the Â£-.p and the timbers lining
the incline his life was crushed out.
Young Farish was refined and gentlemanly in manners, and good and gen
erous impulses. These qualities endeared him to all -whom he met and no
one who knew him would wonder at his popularity.
United States Marshal Shine hesitated a long while before he would con
sent to break the sad news to -the boy's father. He asked Secret Service De
tective Brown to perform the mournful task, but Mr. Brown declined, and
after the deputies in the office had exhibited equal reluctance he was
obliged to break the news himself. Mr. Farish, though past middle age, is
a man of strong nerve, but when he heard the fateful tidings he was dis
tracted "with grief. â  ;,.â 'â â "â 'â .
The funeral will be held Monday at Haywards Presbyterian Church.

True tn prediction, the bazaar given by

last night in a blaze of glory. During the

The worthy cause of charity for which
the affair has been given profited boun

can place no positive figure on their re

120,000 will be turned into the

GERMANS NOW
WANT DAMAGES
Urge War Claims Against
America.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Pre?s.
BERLIN, May . 6.â The belief has
taken complete possession of the public
mind in Germany that German inter
ests n Samoa have been brutally and
ruthlessly disregarded by both England
and the United States. It seems that
this view is steadily gaining strength
â¢with nearly all classes. . The press cer
tainly reflects the sentiment with in
creasing violence. The : rvernment has
done nothing the past week eithtr to
fortify or dispel this trend of public
opinion. The Government press has
been strangely silent unon the subject.
The Agrarian newspapers and many
other journals have seized the occasion
of the birthday anniversary of the Im
perial Minister for Foreign Affairs,
Baron yon Bulow, to severely attack
him tor what they style his supreme
disregard of Germany's legitimate in
terests in Samoa ,and his alleged obse
quiousness toward Great Britain and
the United States. The matter of
claim for damages, both in Samoa and
the Philippine Islands, for German
property destroyed in recent engage
ments has also been iniected int the
press discussion with singularly grow
ing excitement, the assertion being
made that the Unil States meant to
disregard these "just claims/ The Tm
perial Foreign Office, however, has done
nothli to create or foster this condi
tion of public foelinf.
In thf course of an Interview with
tiif correspondent of the- Associated
United States Embassador An.
drpw D. Whtte Bald: "The question r,f
German â  damages for prop
erty destroyed in the Philippine Isl
ands or in Samoa in consequence o f
thf- a -ts of our naval or land forces

' So far as I am aware, no such quesu
ti'in has yet come up at the Foreign
Office. At any rate, it is too early to
;ss the subject, a? no evidence, pro
i or con, has been advanced on either
side. It appears that the sole ba
the wholesale charges in th-
I pers with regard to these alleged enor
! mi 'l.- c is a few private letters
! received from the Philippine Islands
hi).! Samoa, in which the writers seem
to make out a case .in advance."
Tht- Vossiche Zeitung and other Jour
nals have reproduced two of these let
ters, taking for granted all that
therein claimed, and arguing on thÂ»
lines presented by the writers of the
letters, who, among a number of al
leged facts, asserted that Major Gen
eral Otis at Manila had bluntly de
ed to recognize any German claims
for damages. When Erabassador White
was asked about this matter he was
very reticent, only saying: "i I
the r f General Otis on any of
these cases would have -great weight
with the State Department, but in any
event the final adjustment of such
claims must be made at Washington,
and not ;it Manila."
The Kreuz Zeitung, in the course of
an editorial that has attracted a -
of attention, said: "Despifc
African agreement between England
I and Germany, and despite the civilities
interchanged, this extraordinarily per
! fidous action in Samoa was plann< rl by
the English, who krpt in the back
ground and sent some American hot
spurs to the front in order to establish
the fact of an Anplo-Amfric;;!) broth

and tho United States to the â¢ xt-nt
that an understanding was rendered
next to Impossible. This much is cefÂ«
tnin, th.'U the friendly understanding
between the United States and Ger
many is a combination that British
.statecraft just now relishes least or
all."
The North German Gazette, mention*
ing reports that English and American
merchants in Samoa express a desire
to see Germany annex the whole of the
grovlp, bitterly attacks the Imperial
Foreign Office for suppressing this
statement and keeping it out of the
press.
The Agrarian Deutsche Tags Zeltunp,
in the course of a severe review of GerÂ»
many's attitude toward the United
States during the past year, blames thÂ»
Imperial Foreign Office with "knuckling
down to the | Americans" in every case
even recalling the instance of Admiral
yon Diederichs at Manila, "so as not to
hurt the feelings of Messieurs "the
. Americans." The article concludes as
: follows: "Only by now showing a bold
and unyielding front can the prestige
of the empire, which has suffered so
seriously latterly, be re-established."
The same newspaper and a number
of others blame the Emperor for show.
ing too much friendliness toward the
Americans, and charge President Mc
.Kinley with a gross want of tact In
not replying to Emperor William's tele
gram of congratulation on the subject
of the new transatlantic cable in Ger
many and thus outraging all interna
tional courtesy. On the other hand the
Berlin Tageblatt, the Cologne Gazette
and a large part of the liberal press
take a more rational view of the rela
tions' between Germany and the United
States, alluding to the good will of the
United States as recently shown on
several occasions in highly complimen
tary terms.
LABOR SCORES A POINT.
LOS ANGELES, May 6.-Ever since the
street railway companies began to des
ignate rolling stock as mall cars to car
ry malls by special arrangements with
the Postofflce Department, the Innovation
has been looked upon with suspicion by
the , labor u nio ns - Labor organizations
think the placing of the words "United

fuge to secure Federal protection against
strikers: This became so general that or
ganized labor undertook to prevent what
they considered a move against their In
terests, and a telegram Bent to President

THE SAM FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 7, 1899.
MAY CALL AN
EXTRA SESSION
McKinley Intimates That
It May Be Necessary.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, May 6.
Senator Hawley conferred with the
; President to-day on several political
and in the course of his talk
c about the reports of a probable
of Congress. The Presi
dent did not commit himself definitely
to the project of calling an extra ses
sion, but intimated that such a course
The President did
i on the subject, but all
that he did say plainly indicated the
idea of an t-xtra session has entered
, his mind, and that It may develop later
on. Senator Hawley said:
"I think an extra, or early session of
Congress necessary.- There will be more
important work before the next Con
j gress than ever before known. Besides,
. the election of Speaker and the selec
; tion of House committees will take
1 much time."
A number of Congressmen now in
Washington desire to know something
Ite bo they can make arrange
ments about their business and house
hold affairs. There Is no probability,
however, that this information will be
lined from the White House. The
President cannot decide the question
now and will not do so. All he can
say is that an early session may be
â¢ -sary, and that as the situation
looks to him now such a session is
than a possibility. Senator Haw
ley says that members of Congress are
"minute men" and should be ready at
any moment to re.-pond to a summons.
The calling of an early session of
â¢ ess is almost certain, it was
hinted by a prominent official to-day,
if peace is finally arranged in the
Philippines. The President said to one
of his callers to-day that he regarded
the insurrection in the Philippines as
drawing to a close. The establishment
of peace in the Philippines will imme
diately bring prominently forward the
future of is and if this is to
be Bettled by the ne-xt Congress or even
partially considered that Congress will
have to meet early, it is said.

GERMANS SHY AT
"EMBALMED BEEF"
Still Fighting Importa-

Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, May 6.â The agrarian cam
paign against the meat inspection bill con
tinues in full force. The Federation of
Husbandry this week presented 3056 pe
titions against the bill. The agrarian
Deutsche Tages Zeitung, which has had a
series of articles aiming to show that all
American meat imported into Qermany
is unfit for food, presents a letter from
Ernest Benninghoven of Chicago regard
ing the meat, industry of that city. Ben
ningho.ven in this letter claims to know
positively that all canned meat intended
for export to Germany is from diseased
and otherwise unlit animals. Wagon loads
of such meat, he asserts, are delivered
weekly at the leading packing houses for
embalming purposes/ Inspection, the
writer adds, is a howling farce, owing to
wholesale bribery. The writer added that
he hoped Germany would not allow the
importation of such meat. This letter has
been widely reproduced in the German
and is quoted as conclusive proof
from headquarters against all American
meat.
The failure of the Filipinos to secure an
armistice is generally regarded here with
regret and the hope is expressed that an
amicable understanding will soon be
leached.
The sending of Commissioners from
Germany for the purpose of studvlng the
status and methods of New York life
insurance companies has been much com

press. The Kreuz Zeitung says: It is
to be hoped that if the Government fgatn
grants companies the right to operate in
Prussia certain conditions will be at
tached, and that especially no tontine
features will be permitted in German
policies, such features partaking of the
nature of a lottery.

FROST'S DAMAGE
IN FRESNO COUNTY
Gloomy Reports From
Vineyards.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO, May 6.â The vineyardists
of Fresno County have been wearing
gloomy faces for the last week, because
of the damage done by the recent kill
ing frosts. The tender canes of the
vines have turned black, having been
bitten by Jack Frost, who made his
visit just when the most damage would
result. The injury was worse than ap
peared at first sight, for after they had
been exposed to the sun for a few days
the new growth turned blacker and
blacker.
A week ago Alexander Gordon of the
Farmers' Club sent out circulars to the
leading vineyardists of the county ask
ing them to state the extent of the
damage done by the frost. Their an
swers were received to-day and a com
parison showed a discouraging result.
Fully 33 per cent of the first crop has
been ruined and the damage may yet
prove to be even greater than this fig
ure indicates.
A peculiar thing about the frost is
that it seemed to come in currents.
Certain vineyards were damaged while
adjacent places escaped altogether or
were only slightly bitten.
F. M. Helm had just returned from
a visit to his ranch and he was pretty
"blue." He said he considered halt of
his crop ruined, although he hoped
that the outcome would not be so bad
as at present indicated. The vineyard
of George I. Helm, adjacent, escaped
the ravages of the frost, only one cor
ner of about fifteen acres having suf
fered at all. E. H. Kowasky's place
across the road, which is rented by
Chinese, is said to have been entirely
destroyed by the frost. The Pugh vine
yard suffered. The biting cold did great
damage to the Butler vineyard, the
young growth nn the vines having been
burned and blackened. The Forsyth
place showed the ravages of the de
vouring frost, while the Kennedy place
was damaged. The damage to wine
grapes was even worse than to the
raisin grapes, it is said.
In the Scandinavian colony tho wine
grrapr-s were badly damaged. Col uiel
Trevelyan reports that fully a quarter
of the crop of the Barton estate was
destroyed by the frost.

SPANISH BISHOPS
BEING DEPOSED
Changes Made in West
Indies.
Special Dispatch to The CaJI.
NEW YORK, May 6.â Spanish
Bishops are being deposed and it is
probable a call will soon be made for
Catholic priests who can speak Span
ish to volunteer to go on missions to
our new possessions in the West In
dies. The first official changes made
there by the Pope's delegate, Arch
bishop Chapelle of New Orleans, are
now announced. Bulls from Rome, in
dorsing his nominations for the sees
of Santiago and Porto Rico, are ex
pected to arrive during the coming
week.
In pursuance of his commission as
apostolic delegate to Cuba, Porto Rico
and the Philippines, Archbishop Cha
pelle visited the islands in the West
Indies early in the year and made a
thorough investigation of the affairs
of the church there. He found the see
of Porto Rico deserted by its Bishop, a
Spaniard, who was appointed just be
fore the war broke out, but who re
fused to leave Spain and take up his
duties on the island. The Archbishop
recommended that he be deposed and
that Rev. James Blenk, C. M., pastor
of St. Mary's Church, New Orleans, be
made Bishop in his place. Cardinal
Kampolla has cabled that the Pope ap
pr.oves of this nomination.
In Santiago, the premier see of the
catholic church in the western world,
was found another Spaniard, Monsig
nor Saenz, who was unwilling to re
main under the jurisdiction of the
United States. His resignation was
forwarded to Rome, where it waa at
once accepted. The Pope, at Arch
bishop Chapelle's suggestion, has ap
pointed as his successor the very Rev.
Canon F. Barnada of Santiago Cathe
dral chapter, acting as administrator of
the archdiocese. He is a native of San
tiago and esteemed as the most dis
tinguished of the native Cuban priests.
He ppeaks English fluently and is a
great admirer of our institutions.
As soon as the b'i"- arrive from
Rome preparations will be made for thÂ»>
consecration of both of these prelates
and their installation in their respec
tive sees will soon bo followed by the
advent of Driests from here to help
them to put the Cuban church Into
agreement with the conditions thai
prevail in the church throughout th^
rest of the United States.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
XEW YORK. May 6.â Racing in real
earnest for IS'jO began to-day at Morris
Park, the s-pring meeting at Aqueduct
being little more than a curtain-raiser for
ihe greater events of the year. The day
â  was such a fine one that the peopl<; came
I in crowds, and when the first race was
run. there was scarcely a vacant seat on
the great grand stand and the la'vya was
filled. When the time came for the Met
ilitan handicap there were at least
20,000 people at thÂ« track,
Shortly before 4 o'clock the candidates
for the. Metropolitan, fourteen in all. were
sent out for the final furlong through tho
stretch and every one was full of life.
The betting showed Filagrane a istant
favorite all the way through.
Although there was considerable lelay
at the post, owing to the actions of
Box, who refused to join his Held, they
finally got away well, with. Algol lirst to
show. Previous was close behind; San
liers next and St. Cloud following. They
had pretty well settled Into their places
when a quarter had be< :i run. and San
ders was on! in front, lit haa but a head
the advantage of i'iligrane. however,
whili Ethelbert was a length hind, a
neck in front of Si. Cloud. The others
were close up, although Don dj oro, Ban
aster and Box were back in the rear Don
uÂ«- Oro div a good deal of sulking, for he
had been bumped and did not like it a
bit.
They rushed away for the quarter at a
hot pace, and when they passed thi pole
in twenty-four seconds; the ear division
was beginning to crack. . ders was a
length m Hunt and going so well as to
make him look -â  rous to those who
had plunged on the favorites. Filigrane
was second; a length in front oJ Etheibi rt
fei . Cluud was siill a neck â  hind him.
a::.] the others were rattling along, some
ol them beginning to labor. The three
ruriongs had been run m thirty-six sec
onds, and the places had not cnanged to
ihe half mile was reached In 49 seconds
âa last pactâ and Sanders was still stick
ing to the lead by a length. Those in the
rear division were straining th< mselvi a in
a wild effort to get up, Dut they cou.d
do nothing with the flying leaders who
were making a hot pace for the distance
Aroundjthe turn they rushed and then
came tIK- struggle for position in me
stretch. Sims took no chances. He
hugged the rail with Sanders, losing not
a toot ol ground as he saw the straight
quarter ol a mile to home and nothing
'"vf.front â â¢' him. Around the turn he
whirled, and straightened out in the
stretch still a length to the good.
ttnelbert, howewr. had quickened his
pace, and gut his neck in tront of Fili
grane imp. a hatf gth behind him
find .\lÂ£(l irth. The others were out
ot it then. Down to the last furlong pole
went rh<? leaders. >vith the jockeys driv
ing hard. Sims and Sanders were still
in front, but the thundering hoofs were
getting nearer and nearer, and horse and
rid< r strived the utmost to hold the slight
advanatage that was slipping away so j
fast. Ethelbert was almost at his throat- i
latch; a lurlong from home, and was ;
gaming with every stride and the crowd
veiled wildly for the game inimal. It
was only for an instant, when the all
scarlet jacket of Clawaon on Filigrane j
Hashed by them as if they were again I

POKES FUN AT
AMERICAN LAW
Lord Russell Criticizes
the System.
j Copyrighted, ISO 9, by the Associated Tress.
i
LONDON, May 6.â There was con-
Biderable astonishment at the dinner
of the Hardwicke Society on Monday,
at which United States Embassador
Joseph H. Choatt was a guest, that
the L/ord Chief Justice, Lord Russell of
Killowen, should have seized the <--<-<-.i
--i sion to lecture his audience upon the
shortcomings of the American legal
system. Lord Russell was very tree
in his criticisms and very facetious over
the number of Judges he met in Amer
ica, but Mr. Choate was equal to the
occasion and in c good-natured speech
said that he desired to say that Justice
was administered to the satisfaction <<f
the people, to whom substantial justice
! brought very small cost. Justice, Mr.
Choate add d, was within the reach of
every man, and he was encouraged to
defend and maintain his rights in
! court, and hi.s costs were little as com
â  pared with what Mr. Choate undei
was the cost here. Referring to the
â¢ number of Judges in America, Mr.
Choate said he could not Bee how it
,i be possible for twenty-five men
to conduct the legal business for 80,000,
--000 of people.
TV correspondent of the Associated
i l"iess has had an interview with Lord
stoke on the subject of the lat
t( r'a visit to America, from which he
has just returned. Referring to the
present rush to form trusts and Byridi
! cates in America, Lord Revelstoke, who
! ip a director irf tin- Bank of England
i and a member of the banking house of
Baring Brothers & Co., Limit* d, said:
"Th> se combines appear to be of im
j mense advantage. Wildcat Bchemes
.would undoubtedly be formulated froi i
time to time, but great organizations

opinion, in most cases, resulted in un

of management, and have been bene
ficial In financial and other results.
Englishmen hardly yet appreciate the
and potentiality of the present
movement, but there will soon be a re
vulsion of public opinion in favor of
these combinations. America is going
forward by leaps and bounds, and will
make things extremely uncomfortable
for British Industry if we of England
do not recognize more fully that vast
capital enterprise, as opposed to more
limited individual venture, can only
end in favor of the former, and that
is where America is now getting her
pull. The great copper combine has
put all other speculative interests into
the shade. The railroads share market
is most apathetic and the open ac
counts in 'Yankees' in London has been
reduced to the minimum. But this is
only a temporary phase. Another six
months will see a great change." Lord
Etev< Istoke concluded the interview by
saying that "a visit to America is an
education in itself."
Politically, the event of the week was
the speech Of Earl Rosebery before the
London Liberal club, yesterday even
ing, which is the leading topic of dis
cussion to-day. The speech was tanta
mount to an about-face on the Dart of
the Karl, who expressed his desire for
a revival of the old Liberal spirit that
prevailed prior to 1886, and said that
he regretted the division occasioned by
the home rule question.- His onslaught
on "hideous political apathy," and his
tracing of the decay of parliamentary
liberalism to home rule, it is thought,
may be (he forerunner of his return
to the head <>f a united Liberal party.
The stress which Lord Rosebery laid
upon Imperialism has given the im
pression that he would be will-in" to
give it home rule's place in the Liberal
programme, quietly dropping home
rule. â¢
GOLD WITHIN FIVE
MILES OF SKAGUAY
SKAGUAT. Alaska. May 2 (via Union
Bay, i!. C, May 6).â An important gold
Btrike haa been made within live miles of
Skaguay, mi Monday Creek, just across
the bay I'rom Skaguny. Major John
Stanley and a party of five pot a tip from
;> prospector, and yesterday morning they
wenl over and explored the creek for
nine miles, going nearly to the summit.
<>wi;;; to deep snow they failed to reach
the top. They found Rood colors in the
gravel two feet from the surface. They
staked every claim and divided the
twenty-six acres among- the six. On their
return the newt; spread like wildfire until
a stampede ensued. Every available
small steamer and rowboat was pressed
into service to take the stampedes
acroes. Over 300 crossed over last night,
anil many more went over to-dajv.
EWA PLANTATION
STOCK INCREASED
Three Million Raise in
Capital.
HONOLULU, April 29.â Ewa Plantation
Company's stockholders were good to
themselves to-day to the tune of $3,000,000.
At an adjourned special meeting, of which
three weeks' notice was given, they voted
to increase the capital stock from $2,000,
--000 in 20,000 shares of $100 each, par value,
to $5,000,000 in Â§50,000 shares of $20 each,
p;tr value. None of the shares of the in
crease are to be sold excepting the frac
tional ones of the allotment. They are to
be allotted as a stock dividend to the
present holders of the company's shares.
Origlniilly the capital was $1,000,000. About
two years ago this was doubled by means
of a stock dividend, when the shares had
risen to a market value of $400. Jt was
then explained that the increase was
based upon property in sight. Now, on
this occasion of a still greater Increase,
no explanation is necessary. The stock
commands $4iXi again, and the Tax Asses
sor levies taxes upon a valuation of $5,000,
--000.
It was also resolved to-day to create a
reserve fund for the company, the amount
to be at the discretion of the directors.
The prospectus of the Olaa Sugar Com
pany was issued to-dai'. The- subscrip
tion books will be open on Thursday and
Frida* next. B. I l '. IMllingham, Lorrin A.
Thurston and Alfred \V. Carter are the
promoters. â¢
Trouble is brewing between the Govern
ment and some of the plantations over the
treatment of laborers. Dr. C. A. Peter
son. Inspector of Immigrants, has brought
a series of charges of maltreatment of
laborers against thy management of a
number of estates. One of these is on this
island. President Dole has demanded a
strict investigation before the Government
will grant permits to the plantations in
question for obtaining fresh recruits of
labor. It is hinted the charges include
one of a free use of the lash in disciplin
ing the "man with the hoe." Other spe
cies of brutality and neglect of the sani
tary protection due the ignorant laborers
are said to be alleged in the reports of
the Inspector.
Boarders for San Quentin.

ASSESSMENT ON UNION
BANK STOCKHOLDERS
Ten Dollars a Share Levied for the
First Dividend to Be Paid to
Depositors.
SAX JOSS, May 6.â The Rank Commis
sioners have ordered the directors of the
Union Savings Bank to levy an assess
ment of $10 a share on the stockholders
anil apply it in paying off the depositors.
This order was received to-day, and will
be welcome news to the depositors, who
have become greatly discouraged at the
delay in t lie settlement. It will show
how many of the stockholders will pay an
assessment without a suit. Only 17 per
cent of the stockholders, it is said, have
property that an assessment may be lev
ied on.
Frank V. Wright has resigned the sec
retaryship of the San Jose Building and
!,<>an Association. The building and loan
association had its office in the bank
building. Shortly after the bank failure
Wright, who is a brother of tho bank
wrecker, was re-elected secretary on the
promise that he would resign in three
months. During the interim he served
without pay. A K. Whitton has been
made secretary in Wright'a place.
A petition asking that the property of
E. B. Howard, the fruit dealer who did a

essential, even though soir.e delay should be in

facts above stated clearly demonstrate.

THE SAX FRAXCISCO CALL, SXTKDAY, MAY 7, 1899.
IN THEIR OWN HANDS.
| â I ROM every point of view the failure of the
prosecution to convict the proprietor of the
Palnce saloon of the "fren^e of conducting a per
i centage poker game at his place of business is to be
regretted. It is we'll known that gambling resort- of
the kind complained of in the case constitute one of
the most offensive evils of the city, and it would have
been gratifying to have found the law powerful
enough to punish any and all who maintain them.
Despite the failure of the prosecution in the case,
however, the public is not without a remedy si
dent to prevent the continuance of such gambling.
The Police Commissioners have the matter in their
â  hands. It is within their power to refuse licenses
to saloons where poker playing is openly carried on,
whether the games be of the kind known as "per
centage games" or those from which the house takes
a "rake-off" for drink-. By an impartial denial of
licenses to ail such gambling places, 'and by fre
quently repeated raids on those suspected of permit
ting poker playing or other forms of gambling, the
evil can he materially diminished, if not altogether
suppressed.
It may l>e noted, furthermore, that by a similar
policy it will be possible for the Commissioners to rid
the city of the nickel-m-the-s!ot machines, which are
among the most tempting gambling devices ever in
vented. The slot machine is in many respects a
swindle as well as a gamble, for the chances given for
winning are by no means so large as the unwary in
vestors of nickels suppose. ()n most of the machines
the cards are so arranged that big winnings carniot be
made, and the patrons of the device are not only en
ticed to gamble but are duped in the process.
Thus while it is to be regretted that our law is so
vague that even a notorious open gambling room can
not be suppressed nor its proprietor punished, there
â  o reason why the police authorities should aban
the fight for public morality and, honesty. The
â  â  mess with which poker playing has been carried
on along our principal thoroughfare lias been some
thing more than a disgrace. It has been an ever
present menace to society. The-e places have been
continual temptations to all clashes of men. I
professional beggars have been found among their
patrons. Young men in positions of trust have been
exposed by them to the temptations which lead to
ruin. There is no telling how many homes have been
; r curse.
The duty of the Police Commissioners is plain.
Let them see to if that police raids are kept up on all
â  - known or suspected to be conducting gambling
games, and where sufficient evidence is found of the
them refuse licenses to the proprietors. The
law of San Francisco is not SO inadequate as the

L< ING ago, anticipating the present situation in
the ; ill, drawirrg an analogy
from the history of the Roman republic, ob
â  â ! that our army, especially the vi â  was
composed of American citizens, edu
ur commi Is, who would not desire
emain permanently ii mj | - we
. and that, if we determined to retain
- territory, they would inevitably
ced by mercenaries.
It was not expected, however, that a year after our
great victory in Manila Bay our volunteers would be;
characterized by civil or military officer^ a* it they |
were already included in the category of mercenaries.
â  such is the fact. The good taste of the j
I distribution of pointed additions to Congressional
literature against imperialism by Edward Atkinson
may be fairly questioned, but to suppress their circu- :
â  at ion through the mails on the avowed ground that
i excite insubordination among the
repu gross and unwar

law or policy and simultaneously to stand by their,
country and by their flag. They need no such exclu- |
.-ion from domestic and foreign information as might
be indispensable to maintain the loyalty of paid mer- !
cenaries. reduced to the condition of subjects.
If Edward \tkinson has broken a law of the United
States he has incurred the penalty attached to the act. I
Upon this ground, but not to prevent discontent or '<
mutiny in our military force in the Philippines, the
action of the Postal Department may he justified. It
has been frequently stated, without apparent contra- !
diction, that an overwhelming majority of our volun
teers are opposed to the permanent retention of the
Philippines, in which exercise of their constitutional
rights they have noi so far antagonized any official
utterance of the Government. Their personal views I
have not dampened their military ardor or their pa
triotic Ai i, or caused the slightest break in
our victorious progn
A tremendous effori to drag this country into an
â  imperial policy is apparent, not in President McKin- ;
ley and his Cal â¢ r among the industrious and
intelligent producers who compose nineteen-twen
tieths of our population, nor even, except to a limited
extent, among the laborious representatives of solid !
enterprise and of accumulated capital, but in the cfass
peculative monopolists, who enjoy their ease at
home and are searching for new fields for their un-
American methods abroad. These men are not only
willing hut anxious that their wealth be increased, not
b> legitimate operations within our undeveloped ter- i
ritory on- this continent, but through the sweat and j
toil and bloody sacrifices of our young citizens in'
foreign parts, who are expected to open the door to
cheap labpr and to supply unlimited opportunities for
unpatriotic opulence.
It has not yet been settled that our institutions arc
to be abandoned, nor has the power of the law or the â 
political authority of the people yet been successfully
disputed.
, The C7ar's peace commission has notified the world j
that it is taking no chances. Recent dispatches are to
the effect that it will contain no representatives from i
South American republics. The reason assigned is ;
that none of them are accredited to St. Petersburg, â 
bui the true one seems to be the fear that the well- ;
known revolutionary tendencies of the overlooked na- i
tions might overturn the preconceived plans of the j
universal peacemakers.

EDITORIAL VARIATIONS.
BY JOHN McNflUGriT.
According to Matthew Arnold, the
duty of a critic Is to diligently
out the best things that have i I
or done in the world and earnestly
strive to make them known to others.
Few writers, however, are willing to
â  j i the responsibility of such a duty
s that. It is j; - isanter to sit idly by
the highway of life in the shade uf a
self-indulgence and wait until someone
comes along blowing a little bubble of
j endeavor; and then arise languidly and
! jab a pen into it to see it burst.
Criticism of that kind imposes rrn dil
igence of search, for in this great van
ity fair trip bubble blowers ar< nunv-r
--; mis and, let the critic rest where he
! will, the game comes to him. Fre-
quently, Indeed, it copies in such shapo
that to let it pass unjabbed would seem
like sheer pood nature, and any exhibi
tion of that quality on the part of a
critic would be as justly subjected to
reprimand as candor In the speech of
a naval ofno> r.
Occasionally, however, there comes
down the ways of the world something
good; and when it comes unasked, un
sought, as freely as the bubbles, he
would be Indeed a villain writer and fit
for treasons, stratagems and spoils,
who would turn away from it without
a word of glad recognition of its merit.
After all, there is as much real service
done to the world in setting forth de
lichtful things as in making a "clean
sweep" of those that are not" delight
; ful. It may be conceded that a cook
whose labor consists in dishing up
dainty things is not a moral reformer;
but after all, such person is. as useful
to humanity as another who makes it
his business to handle the garbage.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Among the books coming to the of
fice during the past week is one so
small that were it not for the binding
it would be called a pamphlet; so full
of poetic suggestion that were it not
for the form of the expression it would
be called poetry. It bears the title,
"Sugar Pine Murmurings."* It comes
from the gold veined, pine clad moun
tains of Amador, and exhales -from
every page the spirit of the land. It is
the work of a brother and of a sister â
j Mrs. Elizabeth Sargent Wilson and J.
: L. Sargent.
Within a space of little more than a
' hundred duodecimo pages it contains
I nine stories -if stories they may be
I called, for after all they are iittl<> more
| than sketches. Their charm is in what
they suggest rather than in what they
tell, and therefore they are rightly
named, for out of each story, simple as
it is, there, comes something like that
which affects one who listens to the
sounds that never cease in a foregt of
pinesâ sounds half mournful, half wild.
which seem to have in them something
"f sympathy with the human, and yet
which continually torment with reit
erated Intimations of unintelligible
mystery. 'â '.>>
â¢
Small as the volume is, and sketchy
.as the stories are, the range of its
themes is- wide. Pathos and humor,
tragedy and comedy, satire and sym
pathy are in it. Each story presents a
character drawn as if it were copied
from flesh and blood. One can hardly
doubt that these people did live in the
mountains and among the mines of
Amador, and that we have in this lit
tle volume a series of genuine pictures
of California'n life.
From the quiet pathos of the story
I of the German miner who worked on
j patiently for years and attained for
| tune only when it was too late, to the
j fierce tragedy of the American miner'
who in the wild justice of revenge en
tombed his wife and h( r paramour in
j the depths of an abandoned tunnel:
from the sad love story of the Indian
j maiden Majel, to the broad comedy of
the tribulations brought upon genial
i John White by his aggressive groats,
! there is surely a wide sweep; but the
j skill of the authors has never once
I failed them every one of the varied
j chords has been rightly touched."

There is mu< h virtue in an "if."
"Sugar Pine Murmurings" would have
been a valuable and in all likelihood a
permanent contribution to the litera
ture of California, ifâ, In this case
the "if" means many things. Its virtue
is pushed almost to the limit. In the
main, however, it signifies, "If the
| writers had seriously tried to make it
j so." The book appears more like a
j souvenir of tales tpld in the loiterlngs
| of Jei&ure hours among the pines than
| like an earnest and resolute effort to
accomplish something in the nature of
enduring rature. The stories reveal
enough to show the. writers have in a
high degree the faculty of depicting
j the manners and the hearts of the va
rious types of men and women who
make up the community of a mining
| district in our mountains, but they also
I reveal a preference for listening to the
I murmurings of the pines on the hills
i rather than digging for the gold be
i neath the surface. Nevertheless the
j promise is great despite the smallness
iin the quantity of the' performance.
I The pan they have exhibited to the
; public shows color of rich ore, and since
that much has been obtained at ease
among the pines, the yield will certain
ly be notable when the authors set
about digging in earnest.
Tho pangs, the pains and the passions
nf poetry are wi.th up always, and the
passions an- of many kin-Is. Th- flurry
over "The Man With the Hoe" has not
! yet subsided, ami now a new agitation
comes to us from The East.' caused by
an Impressionist poem hreathed into
lyric lif' % by Senator Thuraton. The
| point of contention is. curious, it fa n t
| denied that, the poem has ni'Tir. nor is
j it disputed that a Senator may with
| decorum write poetry. It is well known
I a considerable number of Senators have
wooed the muses while serving their
country, and two of their productions
j "My Life Ts T.ik.- the Summer Rose,"
; by Wilde of Georgia, and the sonnet,
"Opportunity." by Injralls of Kansas
rank among the minor classics of the
language. The contention of the de
nunciators of Thurston is that while his
verse is pood of the sort, it is not of
the Senatorial sort: that while a Sena
i tor may write poetry and still hold of
j flee, he should not write the kind that
Thurston has written. The contro
versy, it wiil be seen, is as complex in
its florid array as the prevailing spring
| bonnet, and has an many frills as a
| young woman vith all her style on.
For anything like an understanding
of the agltuiion iht- story rmsei be told
as a whole, Senator Thurston is a wid
ower and 1b of the age which brlngu a
man to maturity in the practice of poll,
Una In Nebraska. It will ha i-eunem
! bered he moved the nation about a
! year ago by a speech on the Cubai. |
! question, in the course of which he re
| ferred to the loss of his wife, and
I swelled the flood of his eloquence with
| a torrent of tears. A short time ago
I at a banquet in Philadelphia he In-;
i formed the gu sts that on the day be- j
| fore a young lady of the city had pre^ j
i sented him with a white rose, and that <
I the sweet gift so sweetly given from !
so sweet a donor had inspired him to '
| this rapture:
j I said to the rose: "Oh. rose! Sweet rose! ;
Will you lie on my heart to-night,
i Will you r:estle there, with your perfume
rare, - . â¢
And your petals pure and white?'
| I said to the rose: "Oh. rose! Sweet rose'.-j
Will you thriil my every sigh,
Tho' your life exhale In the morning pale, j
And you wither and fade and die?" |
I said to the rose: "Oh, rose! Sweet rose!
Will you throb with my every breath;
Will you give me the bliss of a passionate
kiss, â¢
Albeit the end is death?"
The white rose lifted her stately head
And answered me fair and true:
I "I am happy and blest to lie on your
breast
For the woman who gave me to you!"

The Boston Journal, while not deny- !
j ing that the .poem appears to be an ;
j Impulsive flow of song, asserts that it
J carries too much internal evidence of â 
i being an imitation of Tennyson to be j
! accepted by the critics of New Eng
j land as a genuine wood note wild of |
the Nebraska prairies; and it intimates
that the verse is probably a composi- |
tion rather than an inspiration. The j
Washington Post, as a rule i
; treats Senators with deference, seems
to have had its gravity wholly upset i
, by the poem, and mocks at the affair j
from, beginning to end. It spares not
the lady, though she be a Philadel
| phlan, but refers to her as "a Jessica,
| Mariana, Marguerite or Leonora";
j gibes at the rose and avers it ."sparkled '
i with the dew. of .a Quaker hydrant," \
while it describes the effusion itself as
"a little thing, a mere jet of genius, I
but a pang of inspiration which will
bring out the goosefiesh upon ever>
feeling skin."

to make of either side of the contro-
I versy, no judgment to pronounce. The
j lasting beauty and popularity of My j
Life Is Like the Summer Rose" proves
that Richard Henry Wilde had within
him the glow of a true poesy; and the
unquestioned excel! of the sonnet,
, "Opportunity" attests that Ingalls pos
sesses in" a high decree both poetic con
ceptiqn and the faculty of verse. But
the white rose lyric of Thurstori proves
only there are some Senatorial per

citizen has a right to form an un

up and down the State he manages to :
conduct his official life and political
consultations in such secrecy and ob- I
seurity as to -incline to the belief that,
he not only lives, moves and has his
being in a gimlet hole, or possibly a
key hole, but has acquired the habit ot
pulling the hole in with him.
â¢ â¢ â¢
In these days of social reform, when
so much attention â¢'â¢â  given to the ele
vation of the masses, a good many peo
ple are likely to be interested in a reso
j lution just adopted by the municipal
authorities of Mons, Belgium, which
provides that for every child born in
that city the treasurer shall deposit in
the City Savings Bank on the day of
the registration of the birth the sum
of one franc to s:tart the infant with a
bank account, and- so encourage him
or her to be saving thereafter. The
original deposit returns to the city
; when the child becomes of age. but the
interest accruing upon it is the prop- j
erty of the youngster. People in this
country who think the plan a good one
need nflt wait for municipal action, as
almost any American family can start
each of its children with a dollar in a
; savings bank without straining in th*
least. The resolution .is interesting
mainly as an illustration of the extent
to which the Belgians have carried the
: doctrine that a municipality is respon
! .-Mble for the well being of its people.
When the practice of municipal help is
; extended a little further a Belgian com,
i munity will have something of the soil-
I darity of a family, and the city officials
| may claim the paternal right of troune
, ing small hoys who spend their pen
i nies instead of putting them in the sav
ings bank. Paternalism has its defects
as well as its benefits, and few Ameri
can communities would like to intrust |
it to municipal authority.

The action of Edward Atkinson in
sending anti-jingo pamphlets to the j

POKER-PLAYERS IN COURT.
Judge Graham Refuses to Dismiss
the Cases of the Men Arrested
in the Palace Saloon.
Tho verdict of acquittal rendered by the
jury in Judgo Graham's court Friday in
the case of Charles W. Redman of the
â  saloon, Markot street, charged
with permitting a percentage game of
poker to be played, was discussed pro
;!P<i con yesterday morning when Attor
ney Ach renewed his motion for a dis
missal of the other Beven cases.
Ai h during his argument denied that
the prosecution had presented a weak
and contended that the Judge had
permitted questions to be asked that were
not relevant. As the jury had decide.!
that Redman was not guilty, ho saw no
â  to put the city and county to un
sary expense by trying the other
cases.
Prosecuting Attorney Went worth stren
v opposed the motion. Although
one jury had decided against him, he felt
satisfied of the justice of the case for the
prosecution, and that other juries might
I bring in a different verdict. He was con
! vinced that n percentage game had been
played, and no stronger case could have
been put before a jury.
The Judgo denied the motion and re

about caring for the wounded, is a woman
of whom California, of which she is a na
tive, may feel Justly proud.
Mrs. Boysen was formerly a Miss St> v
ena am! is the daughter of the late An
drew Jackson Stevens, who during his
lifetime was master mechanic of the
Southern Pacific Railroad. On hla death,
which occurred several years ago, the
I men under him attested the high esteem
in which he was held by erecting a mon
ument to his memory in Sacramento at
a cost of $3000. He was ever a friend of
the laboring man. and his aim was al
ways to keep wages up and hours down.
His wife'still resides in Sacramento and Is
highly regarded by a wide circle of ac
quaintances.
That Mrs. Boysen cornea from good
stock is shown from her gallant behav
ior during the severe engagement at
Malabon, which rn;-y yet tarn for her tin
title of major, as In the case of Belle
Reynolds. The latter was the only
woman wh<> received a commission in the
Civil War. She is now on the way to
Manila as the representative Ot the Rod
< ross Society.
It if said that with the bullets flying
all around her Mrs. Boysen kept up with
the firing line and rendered efficieni and
timely aid to many a soldier in whom
an insurgent bullet had found a resting
â¢place. She even snatched a riiU- from
the gTaÃp of a wounded soldier and fired
a few shots at the insurgent trenches,
\ amid the cheers of a group of volunteers.
Mrs Boysen went to Manila at the
same time that the Pennsylvania Regi
â  ment left for the scene of operations last
; year. Her son. William, also enlisted,
and was made assistant surgeon of the
regiment. The singular coincidence pre
sents itself of a mother and her offspring
being in their country's service at one
and the same time.
Mrs. Boysen volunteered as a nurse in
the Pint Reserve Hospital as soon as
hostilities commenced, and spent the fol
lowing d&y on the firing line, assisting
Major Ellis. On starting back to one of
the hospitals in the rear a soldier who
was assisting her in a car was shot.
There was not a man In the whole army
corps but would have charged to the very
of Malabon had it been necessary
to do so for her sake. Her present.- at
th<- danger points was an inspiration to
the men. and they fought as they never
It was at this juncture thai General
Wheaton, perceiving this brave little
woman who acted under the most terri
fying conditions as If she were attending
to the duties of her household, said to
her: ,
"I congratulate you on your coolness.
For tho first tinu- in my life I have seen
a woman on the firing line."

and feels a conscious and pardonable
prido in tho distinction which hia sister's
courage has earned for her.
THBEATENS TO KILL.
Captain Ekstrom to Take the Law In
to His Own Hands Against His
Daughter's Betrayer.
Captain John Challeston of the barken
tlne Ruth swore to a complaint In Acting
Police Judpe Groezinger's court yesterday
for the arrest of Captain John Ekstrom
on the charge of battery. It will probably
bo raised to assault with a deadly weapon
to-morrow.
It appears that Captain Ekstrom had
Captain Challeston before the Federal
courts for betraying his 15-year-old
daughter during" the voyage from the
Carolines to this port, Captain Ekstrom
and family having been passengers, but
the case was dismissed on a technicality.
Captain Ekstrom swore that he would
kill Challeston. and yesterday morning,
while Challeston was walking along East
street. Ekstrom attacked him and struck
him on the head with the butt end of a
revolver.
THE NATIONAL GUARD.
It Is Now Asserted That Colonel J. C.
Currier Will Be the Next
Adjutant General.
Said an officer of the National Guard
yesterday: "Tho i?t of May has come
and the Ist of May has gone, yet
the promised appointments have not been j
made," and he referred to the announce
ment made some time since that the com
mander-in-chief would make known his
choice of adjutant general, assistant ad
jutant general and major general on the
day "named.
During the past week sure thing oracles
of the guard have been busy telling their
particular friends on the quiet that they
have It. as the telegraph correspondents
say in relation to diplomatic affairs, "on
the authority of some one high in office,"
that the head of the National Guard will
appoint Colonel John C. Currier to the
office of- adjutant general, that Colonel
William Macdonald (retired) will be ap
pointed brigadier general to fill the place
in the Second Brigade now occupied by
Brigadier General Warfleld, and that
t Brlgadii rs Muller and Last will not be
disturbed In the positions they hold.
There has. however, been some activity
j during tho week in the matter of turning
in the muster rolls of the companies that
were ready to report but wore unable to
do so by "reason of the non-compliance

Captain Whitney.
HONGKONG MARU IN TROUBLE
BARK CLWYD WRECKED ON THE
CHINESE COAST.
America Maru Gets Away for the
Orient â Trouble on the Mall
Dock Between Rival Trans
fer Men.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamer
City of Peking: arrived from the Orient
yesterday morning; but did not dock until
late in th<- afternoon. She had aboard,
in the steerage 201 Chinese. 21 Japanese
and 13 Filipinos, and as these had all to
be transferred to the Angel Island quar
antine station the vessel was detained in
consequence. Captain Smith nf the Pe
king it-ports that the overdue transport
Newport is all right. She was spoken
within a short distance of Honolulu on
April 30 at 6:30 a. m.
Th.- Peking also spoke the steamer Eli
hu Thomson, when 360 miles southwest of
the Farallones.,Thia was on the sth inst.,
at 4 p. m. Captain Whitney of the Thom
son hoarded the Peking and said his ves
sel was making about three knots an hour
and he hoped to make San Francisco in
five or six days. Captain Smith offered to
tow the Thomson into port, hut Captain
Whit my declined the offer, hut very glad
ly accepted two bolts of sailcloth with
winch to make extra sails. There Is $40.
--000 insurance on the hull and about $55,000
on the cargo of sugar of the Elihu Thom
son.
Th>> tug Relief is now out searching for
the broken-down steamer, hut as Captain
Randall will allow for leeway and the
Thomson has not made any. the chances
are against her being picked up. Yester
day afternoon the underwriters chartered
the steam schooner Rival and sent her out
on a search. Knowing mat the Thomson
is following the regular course to San
Francico, the chances are that the Rival
will pick her up.
The Japanese steamer Hongkong Maru
is still having trouble with her boilers
and was two days late in reaching Yoko
hama. Repairs had to be made at Hong
kong before she started on her maiden
voyage, more work hail to be done on
them at Honolulu, and in this port they
received a thorough overhauling. She left
here on March 17 last arid all went well as
far as Honolulu. After leaving Hawaii
the trouble began. Very heavy weather
was encountered, a tire broke out in the
bunkers and the boilers began to leak
again. In consequence the Hongkong
Maru was two days late in reaching
Yokohama and she had to be detained
there three days for an overhauling.
The Peking brings the news of the loss
of tli- British bark Clwyd. She left Hnng
kong for I'.tu with a load of rice a^d
wen! on the Pratas shoal in a gale. The
Captain/ and crew escaped in the boats
and when they siw th<rn was no hope for
the ship they started for the coast of
China. Mate H. .Tones nnd nine nr-n
reached Hongkong in one of the boats and
Captain Thomas and twelve men were
picked up by the Japanese steamer Fn
tami Mam and landed In Hongkong. The
men lost everything except the clothes
they had on.
Then- was <imte a row on the wharf
among the transfer men while the bag
gage of th.- Peking's passengers was he
ing passed by the customs officers. One
of the drivers of thf Pacific Transfer
Company went on the wharf to g>-t some
baggage and Morton of Morton's Special
Delivery at once called on his men. Then
there was trouble, which was only quelled
by the customs authorities throwing all
the transfer men off the wharf.
The steamer Ocean Wave is to be
brought from Puget Sound to San Fran
cico and will go on the Vallejo run in
coninnction with the Monticello. This will
enable the Messrs. Hatch to give the peo
ple of Mare Island nnd Vallejo an extra
good service and will he a hard blow at
the railroad. The Ocean Wave was built
for the Seattle-Whateom route at Grays
Harbor She will be towed from Seat
tle to San Francisco by thÂ»' tug Holyoke.
The bark Haydn Brown and the ship
Kails of Clyde both arrived rom Hawaii
yesterday The Rrown was twenty-one
days from Kahalui and the Falls of Clyde
twenty-three days from Honolulu. Both
are sugar laden.
The Japanese steamer America Maru
sailed for the Orient yesterday afternoon.
Among the passengers were General En
jran Mrs. Kingdon. George Gould s moth
er-in-law, and E. S. Gray. The latter is
secretary of the California Construction
Company and goes to Honolulu in con
nection "with the work of improving that
harbor.

CYCLERS' RELAY RACE
WILL SOON BE ON
HUNDRED-MILE CONTEST FOR
SUNDAY, MAY 14.
California Club Events â Another Big
Price-Cut Jars the Dealers.
Bravery of Wheelmen
at Manila.
The Associated Clubs' annual hundred
mile relay race is now but a week off, the
date this year being Sunday. May 14. It
Is now apparent that but four clubs will
enter teams, the Olympic, Bay City, Gar
den City and Acme wheelmen. While
there is a general idea of who will con
stitute the teams of each, the most im
portant feature is where, the individual
men will be placed, that is. what relay of
ten miles out of the total hundred each
man will ride, and this will not be known
except to those on the, inside until the
last moment. The Bay City Wheelmen
have won the race for the last four suc
cessive times, and are making strenuous
efforts to capture it this year. But every
year the opposition is stronger and their
rivals become more dangerous, and they
will have a hard fight this time.
Chairman Loos of the racing board has
in hand a request from Salt Lake City to
sanction certain meets to be held there.
This shows the far-reaching extent of the
association's control of racing matters.
The California Cycling Club will tour to
Tocaloma to-day. taking the 8 a. m.
Sausalito ferry. The club held an enjoy
able dance last Saturday evening, and it
is the intention to have these monthly
events at the club house hereafter. H.
Buttgenbach and A.McAdam have been
appointed lieutenants.
A prominent wheel agent on the Coast
has announced a price cut which will Jar
the trade considerably. Hereafter hieh
gfrade wheels will be sold for $40. Not
| since the chainless price went down from
$125 to $30 has there been such a deep cut
on a high-grade machine. It demonstrates
that the manufacturers have put expense
down to a minimum and the public is now
getting the benefit of the saving.
Frank James, an old-time member of
the Hay City Wheelmen, is now first as
sistant-engineer on the transport Warren.
When in port recently James told some
of his old ciubmates of the marvelous
bravery shown by another old Bay City
rider. A. D. Allan Jr.. who went to Ma
nila with the First California. He says
that Allan has thrice been called from the
ranks before his company and commended
for his bravery. Arthur Lundborg is an
other Bay City man with the California
regiment who hns distinguished himself,
and the papers have been full of compli
ments for Lieutenant Colonel Duboce.
who was one of the leaders of the Asso
ciated Cycling Clubs.

new r-!an, a radically different rystera, which
â¢ays positively that any k!r.-! of a rupture, old

The experience cf Mr. Colby is cited a.- an evi-

Mr. Colby was bskdl] ruptured. For fifteen

THE "GAP" MAY
NOT BE CLOSED
Huntington Seeking to
Back Out.
Special Dispntch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA, May 6.â Edward
Ivison, chairman of the right of way
committee of this county, and the one
upon whom the burden of correspond- '
ence with the railroad piala haa
fallen, received a very discouraging I
letter late this afternoon which may |
mean another long delay on the part of 1
the Soutl Pacific Company in the
closing of the much-talked ' iraD 1
between Ellwood and Surf. Th<Â» deeds
for every mile of road through this and
San Luis Obispo nties have been in â 
the hands of the company for ten years, ;
and it was hardly thought ac this !ate
day that any trouble .ts to right of
way would de-ay the company in the
completion of th< work.
The sub connectors have had ditli
culty iili Louie G. Dreyfus, well
known here as a shrewd real estate
agent, and who owns many acres of
land about fifteen miles from thi3 city
through which the road must run. This'
has caused the officials of the road to
demand a halt on his part or else york
will i â¢ ise. Several camps have been
established along the way as far as
the .Eagle Canyon land owned by Drey
fus. At this point the contract of
Ramlsh & Marsh begins, and they have 'â 
found it utterly impossible to come to
any conclusions regarding a camp_ lo
cation. Dreyfus demanded rent for
lands to be used for camp privilege, j
which th^ contractors did not want to
pay. Then the Supervisors of this J
county stepped in an/1 granted the right i
to establish camps along the county
road to these men. but this was not
satisfactory to then Dreyfus also de
manded pay for water and quarry
rights, and, the contractors say,
: haa placed every obstacle in their way.
: This has delayed the work of construc
i tion three weeks, giving the already
too-anxious corporation a hole through j
which to back out of its agreement to
complete the road immediately.
There is also considerable trouble in
regard to securing the right of way for
side issues, such as camp conveniences
through the Santa Anita rancho, which
is conducted by the Hollister estate
and through which the road must go
for a distance of twenty-seven miles.
It is understood that this can be easily j
settle.!.
Although it is admitted by all that
Dreyfus has done much t<r prevent the
road's advancement through his prop
erty, yet it. is thought here Collis P.
Huntington is using this for an excuse
for not building the line. Huntington's
letter and Edward Ivison's reply, which
was mailed this evening, are as follows:
SAN FRANCISCO, May 2, 1599.
To Mr. Edward Ivison, Banta Bar
baraâMy Deax Sir: There seems
to be some difficulty in obtaln-
I ing the right of way between Surf I
and Santa Barbara, and J very much re
pret It, as I have had great trouble in
I gettir- work started.
] am quite willing to admit that the
1 work should have Been completed long
before this, but there has been opposition
; from within on the ground that th line
would not pay ua to build,' since we al
ready had a good line between San Fran
cisco and Lob Angeles, via the San Joa
i quln Valley. It seems strange to me now
i that we should find our progress hindered
! by opposition to our getting the right of
i way through properties that He in the |
i line of oui route and by all sorts of ob
stacles other than asking unreasonable
consideration, things, to be done in return
for such right of way privileges, and all
this when, aa everybody ought to be able I
to sco, the c mpleting of this Important
gap will be verj much more to the Inter
est of the people along the line of our
road than it can be to the owners 'and
builders of the road.
We do not' expect to get even fair re
turns for the Investment we are making
In building this new road for years to
come, although of course we are build
ing with the hope and belief that the
time will come when we shall get some
Just return for the large amount of money
â we have laid out and are yet to expend.
Undoubtedly considerable businesi which
will go over the new coast line will be
business actually taken from the old line
up the valley, as the new line will have
some advantages over the other, but un
less we can get the right of way secured
to ua within a reasonable time the work
will be stopped and I phiill be in favor
myself ol putting the matter forthwith
Into tn<-- courts In order to obtain the' re
quired rights of way. Naturally that
v>ould take much timeâ possibly yearn
pr.d It In cniAStlonable whether some" of the
Viicrei ty-ownrra would not so object to
ibis being done that they would prefer tc
hp.vo the work stopped* indefinitely, al
thcugta it will not if w< can get the
rights of way, even by litigation, within
a reasonable length of time.
I know, however, bow difficult It is to
get tr-ese matters nut of court after they
I are once i.:. ai.d bo I wish to say he
tha,. If -our people want this road you
; should t,, stir yourselves at once and Bee
! that all obstacles to its construction are
! removed aa rapidly as they well can be.
We should be willing to pay something
for the right of way, although as I have
| Indicated before every man who owns
I tanda which the road will need to tra
verse will. in my opinion, be benefited by
the presence of the road tenfold what the
builders and ownera of the road will be
through their outlay in completing it.
I Yours truly, C. P. HUNTINGTON.

: opposition in obtaining the right of way
| between Surf and Santa Barbara." I
presume you meant between Surf and
I Ellwood, as the road is already built from
I Santa Barbara to Ellwood. Our commit
! tee say "you have deeds for every mile
! of road through our county and cannot
understand wherein you have cause of
complaint." You give no particulars and
give no names of parties who are mak-
I Ing the trouble, so how are we to know?
Your letter is the first intimation we
; have had that anybody Is "kicking," and
i of course we can say or do nothing until
such information comes from your com
pany. Yours truly.

Ex-Secretary of State Brown expected

â  an a commission permit
ting him to serve nineteen months as an
- rt that he had
positive assurance at the time he with
drew from the gubernatorial nomination '
that he would be appointed president ..f
the State Board of Harbor Commissioners

secured easily a renominatlon for

ambition to become Governor blinded his
judgment. Hie hope of hecoming Hfwhor

when Paris Kilburn was appointed to

was willing to take anything that the ad
ministration might tender.
It is the gossip h.-re to-night that the
appointment of Brown was desired by the

Brownsâ Brown of Calaveras and firown
of San Francisco. The other members of
the board are R. H. Reamer of Woodland

Major Frank McLaughlin, chairman of
Republican State Central Committee
was "on the inside" with the Governor
this afternoon, and the outside gossip was
to tht effed that the Major was pulling
hard to get the Governor to appomt .Ja-
S'eppacher Registrar of Voters. It
pinion oji the outside that the
major was in a fair way to carry his
point. The story told to outsiders was
that Burns favored 'the appointment of
mblyman Rlckard, and the Governor
v.as inciined to name George 11. Pippy for
the place.
State Senator La RuÂ» had an audience
with the executive nnd presented hia

"What's the row?" he asked of a
jaunty policeman who was balancing
himself on one foot on the curb.
"No row at all, at all." responded
the blue coat. "It's the same ould
thing."
"Same old thing?" queried the crip
ple, dodging a crowd of newcomers.
"Vis," said the policeman. "They're
all waitin' their turn with Healer
Truth."
"Who's Healer Truth?"
The policeman stared at the cripple
in amazement. "Ye don't know who
Healer Truth is?" he gasped. "By St.
Patrick, ye don't read, the papers thin,
me lad. He's a healer of most ivery
disease known to man."
The cripples eyes flashed and he
breathed heavily. "I wonder if he can
cure me?" he asked-, after a pause.
"Try him, me lad; try him."
The cripple went his way and was
lost in the crowd. An hour later the
policeman was accosted by a young
man who asked him if he knew him.
â i )i never set eyes on ye before," said
the officer.
"I'm the cripple you sent to Healer
Truth just now."
"The divil ye are." shouted the officer.
"That fellow was a cripple and wore
crutches. There's nothing wrong with
ye, apparently, me lad."
Nevertheless I'm the man," an
swered the other. "One treatment by
Healer Truth made a new man of me
and I was enabled to leave my crutches
tn his office. After another treatment
I'll be as well as ever I was. Much
obliged to you." The one-time cripple
then disappeared.
This is a dally occurrence in and
about the office of Healer Francis
Truth, at 440 Geary street. Hundreds
of sufferers, whose cases were regarded
as absolutely without hope, have re
covered the use of their limbs and
eyes and been enabled to enjoy the
sweets of health at his hands. The

past few months have served to bring
to his door the afflicted of every walk
of life and In all stages of disease. Of
the thousands who have gathered there
not a single one has failed to secure
relief and in hundreds lasting cures
were accomplished.
Healer Truth's private office is a
curio in its way and is worthy of a
visit. The walls are adorned with
crutches artistically arranged, cast-off
goggles, ear trumpets, shoe?, etc. Even
the last quid of a tobacco chewer finds
a place in the collection as a reminder
of a man who gave up tobaccn after
I ufing it for thirty years. Tn the cor
j riers and under the tables are numer-
I ous canes, more or less new, which
were discarded by their owners as use
less after their first treatment by
Healer Truth. All of these relics are
watched with jealous care by the healer
as being souvenirs without price.
Over 3000 persona are now undergo
ing Healer Truth's treatments; a ree
l ord that far surpasses that of any
'â  practitioner in this city or State. In
: addition to these there are hundreds
j of patients living at distant points who
| are being treated for various diseases.
The correspondence in connection with
these cases is enormous, and Healer
Truth enjoys the distinction of daily
receiving the heaviest mail of any sin
gle individual in San Francisco.
Several very wonderful cures -were
accomplished by Healer Truth during
the past week. Several women who
were sufferers for years from serious
female complaints found absolute re
! lief in one or two treatments. Two who
were almost totally deaf had their
hearing restored, and several cases of
impoteney were satisfactorily treated.
Three cases of rheumatism "of many
years' standing in which lasting cures
were effected are placed to Healer
Truth's credit. Many specific cases
might be mentioned were it not that
I Healf?r Truth is bound not to reveal the
j identity of "his patients. The wishes of
I patients in this respect are invariably
complied with. Healer Truth is, how
ever, privileged by hundreds to refer
to them privately and Inquirers after
I additional details are referred to him.

WILL MAKE
A $1.60 RATE
Supervisors Anxious to
Compromise on the Gas
QuexStion.
j Supervisor Kalben at Monday's meeting
: of the Board i>f Supervisors will Introduce
j a resolution rixinc the rate for illuminat
ing gas to consumers at $1 60 per thou
j sand cubic feet. Tt is certain that the [
lution will be carried by the votes of
I Aigeltinger, Attri.lge, Black, Collins. Hol
land, Kalben and Phelps. The higher figure
will be a virtual acceptance of the volun
tary reduction offered by the corporation.
The minority In the board are favorable
to a compromise on the question, which
they regard as a vexatious one. Super
visors rault, Larkmann, Deasy, By
ington and Heyer have expressed them
selves as unalterably In favor of a rate
of $1 3." per thousand cubic feet, but it
is believed they will remain passive when
it comes to a vote, as their opposition
would be useless in the matter. They will
rest content with the 15 cents reduction,
on the principle that half a loaf is better
than none. They hope to gain their desire
by successive and gradual yearly reducr
tions. Holland and Aigeltinger have all
along been regarded as favoring a $1 50
rate, but will vote for the proposed rate of
$1 60.
ervisor Kalhen, when seen last night
in regard to bis proposed resolutions, said:
I am ol the opinion that the rations are
entitled to as much consideration as the lnd.l
-vidual. They have certain rights which should
be respecteil. The $1 10 rate which v..-is put into
effect was taking an unfair advantage of the
gas mpatiy. I have learned that if the rate
Man'.!f the company will set about reducing the
wages of their employes, and that la a subject
which merits our attention. The 15 --ent reduc
ktl n will cause a loss' of over $150,000 yearly to
the i unpany, and ! believe that quite enough
for it to suffer at one clip, it may be true that
{heir Investment Is exaggerated and that they
are receiving a larger return on it than they
are entitled to, bui that Is no reason why the
municipality should take snap judgment and re
duce the rate beyond reason. I will favor a
graduft.l reduction of the rate, but not bo as to
Ido injustice to the gas company. '
In this connection the Street T.ie;hts
Committee has instructed Gas Insppctor
Tupper to prepare specifications for a new
contract to be entprfd into between the
city aiul the gas company. It is not
thoug-ht that Lackmann's attempt to re
duce the price of each street lamp from
11 to 8 cents Will prevail. The price may,
however, be fixed at 10 cents. This will
be done, however, only after Inspector
Tupper has furnished the committee with
a detailed statement of the lights now in
use.
The amended ordinance permit the
Fale of commission pools on dop races will
also come up on Monday for final pr.ssage
and will be acted upon favorably by the
board. There Is no disposition on the part
of the minority to oppose its passage. Su
pervisor Deasy is the only one who ob
fected to the board sanctioning the pro
posal If the provisions of the resolution
do not nullify in any way the restrictions
of the racetrack ordinance It will be
come a law. Tn the event of Mayor Phe
lan vetoing the measure it Is said that the
necessary nine votes to pass It over his
veto will be forthcoming.
GAS AND WATER BILLS.
Two Committees of the Board of Sup-
ervisors Take Action on Claims.
At a meeting of the Water t'ommittpe of
the Hoard of Supervisors held yesterday
it was agreed that the hill of th^ Spring
Valley Water Company for -March he al
lowed In full. The proposition to deduct
16110 91 from the amount of the bill, this
amount being alleged as an overcharge by
the company for the water supplied to
Alamo square and Alta plaza, was not fa
vorably considered, tor tue reason that
been held by the City and County
Attorney that where the company was
prepared to furnish water ami no notio
was served for the discontinuance of the
supply the company is entitled to com
iiens.it lon.
The Street Uprht* Committee approved
the hills of the San Francico Gas and
Ie Company for December. January.
February and March, subject to the ap
proval Of the <sns Inspector. Thle official
declares that he will not approve the bills
until the ffaa company furnishes him a
list of the lights supplied the city. The
bills have been rendered at the old rate
of. il 78 P P r thousand feet and will be ve
by the Mayor should they be passed

BUTCHERS WILL CELEBRATE.
Their Annual Outing to Be Held at
Shell Mound on the 24th Inst.
For six years the butchers of San Fran
cisco have made their annual outing an
elaborate holiday. When 1600 merchants
in San Francisco, Oakland and Alameda
close their shops and with their employes
go for a day's fun, taking their families,
it can he readily understood that the at
tendance at such an affair will be very
large.
This year the Butchers' Board of Trade
will celebrate their Butchers' day on
Vv . Inesday, May 24. As usual, they will
require both Shell Mound Park and the
Oakland Trotting Park to accommodate
their guests. The two parks are neces
sary not only because the one would not
be large enough to accommodate the peo
ple, but also because every butcher, be
ing a horse owner, is" interested in their
races.
A number of valuable gate prizes will
be distributed among those who attend
the pirnic this year. There will also, he
valuable prizes for foot races and games
Which will be held in Shell Mound Park
and for races at the Oakland Trotting
Park.
The committees appointed for the
Butchers' celebration are as follows:

THE NEWSBOYS' HOME
HAS BEEN CONDEMNED
THE ASSOCIATED CHARITIES'
RECENT INVESTIGATION.
A Report to the Merchants That May-
Cripple the Institution
Financially.
The Associated Charities located at 601
Commercial street has placed the stamp <<f
condemnation upon the Newsboys Home
at ,",!!) Howard street. The directors Â«if
the association do not think it is a Rood
thinp, and hove so reported to the Mer
chants' Association.
Several months a#o the newsboys of
tbo city conceived the idea of making a
home for themselves, where they could
eat, Kleop and spend their time when not
enpfaÃril in Belling papers on the streets.
Under the direction of some of the older
heads of the fraternity a plan was formed
based upon decidedly demoeratie ideas,
bordering on socialism, whereby homeless
lads could form a sort of a big family,
paying their share of the expenses of the
home.
The management of the home was un
der the direction of a board of officers,
and there was some little "politics"
amonK the newsboys in getting their men
Into control. Then it was found that the
finances were not as plentiful as was ne
cessary, ami the lads started out among
those Kindly disposed to get such assist
ance as possible. Many private families
and- merchants contributed liberally, and
to outward appearances the scheme
went along boomingiy. Hut then came
an Inquiry, or rather many Inquiries. A
number of merchants, members of the
Merchants' Association, stated that they
wore willing to help In a good cause.
but they wanted to know just how good
the cause was before giving food, bed
ding, clothes, fuel, shoes, etc., to the
"agents" of the home.

tion requested the members of the Asso
ciated Charities to look into the home
ami see if the institution possessed merit
A committee was selected, and after a
careful Investigation, so as to do no one
any harm, made a report at the meeting
df the directors yesterday that grave the
Newsboys' Home the worst kind of a
black eye. The report, as stated by Mrs
I- ranch, was that the home is the means
of drawing many buys from their
parents' homes. The objections are
many. The principal one is that the
home is a nest of young hoodlums. Many
of the newsboys of the city live with
their parents, who are poor and in need
of all tlie assistance they can secure
from the "newsies." In many cases the
mothers work out for their living, and
the dimes the sons bring home go a long
way toward feeding younger brothers and
slMers and paying the rent.
"We have found," said the committee,
"that the romance of living in a news.
boys' home has been the means of en
ticing many of the little supporters from
their homes. We visited the homes of a
number of the boys who are now living
in the place on Howard street and found
their parents greatly distressed because
their sons have goae there and no longer
contribute to their support."
The information was further given that
there is really no n ssity for a news
boys' home. For all of Hi. 'lads who "have
no homes there are plenty of boys'
boarding houses where all the comforts
of home are to be obtained, and the
homeless boys arc t lie exception and not
the rule. The majority live with their
relatives. This report has been sent to
the Merchants' Association, and the re
sult is easy to be seen. On the strength
of the committee's investigation the sup
port Of the newsboys will be withdrawn
and the boys' organization will be made
financially much weaker in a very short
time.
Held for Murder.
The preliminary examination of P. a.
Donovan, charged with the murder of
Alexander Jardlne in the vestibule of St.
Jlose's Church, was concluded before
Judge Mogan yesterday and the defend
ant was held to answer before the Supe
rior Court Without bail. Dr. Zabala. the
autopsy physician, was fn court, and ex
plained that he was busy at the Morgue
Friday- and could not attend.

Krug's Heavy Stick
Work. s â¢
Overcome by their exertions of the pa.-t
week in ssfulty striking: agninst j
their signboard uniforms, the bunch from >
Ban Jvse â¢ were turned' loose against
Hank's srang at Rec.rea.tion Pa.rk yester
day afternoon and emerged from the
niix-up with the short end of a 7-2 score.
Tli-' str:ke at Sar. Jose was barren* of
blcvj^v.od, but H freed the strikers from ;
doing double duty as ballplayers and j
"sandwich" men. Before the sensoii |
piÂ»-M <\ nn enterprising but misguided â 
fan-vie who conducts a 7x9 tobacco em- '
porlurn in the Garden City; conceived the j
â¢ Klittering scheme of utilizing; the ball- i
players to advertise his shop. He hunted
lip the manager and s"on reached an j
agreement with him whereby in consid- j
eration of free elerarettes for the season !
the members of the team were to disport j
c:i die. breasts of their uniforms the let - j
ters "H. B.V life-sized and very black, |
the letters being the initials of the party j
of the first part. The mi'n were not â 
happy nwr the innovationâ they were not
Included in' the . irette dealâ but they !
could not kick th>>n.
Their chance came, however, a few '
day? ago. when the old manager trans- I
ferred hip interest in th*> team to the
present owners. ThÂ« players went into ,
secret session; and when they adjourned '
It was with the announcement that they
had struck against being used as blll
boards any longer. They tined their
uniforms and. charging down upon the
cigar deab-r, tore the hated letters from
their breasts and cast them at the fe<u
of the astounded and indignant adver
tiser. Then thf>y went away to appro
prlately celebrate their claration of
independence.
The cigar dealer is in a frightful state
of mind, but he doesn't know whether
his proper course is to sue the old man
ager or the present owner: attach the
ball park or arrest the players. But he
says that as scon as' he can find law to
cover the case he Is going to take ac
tion.
No wonder, then, that fter all that ex
citement the prune-pickers were not in
the proper frame of mind to â  Bsfully
cope with the home team yesterday, but
they made a gallant effort; and for eight
Irjrnings it was neck and neck, in as prct
t> ;t contest as could i" hande i out to
any crowd of fanatics.
1-lreman Fitz was the chief obstacle in
the path of the visitors. "wo hitsâ one In
the fourth and the other in the seventh
were all the visitors could gather in, and
both of those fell" 10 Dalrymple. Fitz
ttruck out live men. but at times he
marred his work by s.njns up in the Â«lr.
fend had not Swindells and OXeii steadied
. htm d'iwn at critical stapes there Is. no
tiÂ»i)mp- where U)f troul would have
ended!
Anderson was the bright particular
Btar of the San Jose bunch. His work
yesterday stamped him is the best sec
ond baseman in the league beyond a
doubt. Twelve chances, many of them
of the three-ringed circus order, were ac
cepted. He figured in three double plays,
In two of which he was the central tig
Â«r". Altogether it waa Anderson's day
to walk for the cake.
Andrews pitched for the visitors and for
Eix innings was quite effective; then he
let down and. aided by errors on the part
of his supporters, Frisco cinched the
game.
Krug. for the locals, ime mighty close
to winning tlv game by his stick work.
Four hits out of five times up. two runs
-' â¢ two nmre batted in by him, is a hit
ting record rarely equaled. Krug spoiled
his record, however; by making the only
two bungles on that side.
Sullivan was close up to Krug in the
mutter <>f hitting, two of his three hits
bein^r beautiful doubles. Swindells
strengthened the good opinion of him by
his masterly handling of Fitz's delivery
ai:d his throwing to bases. Besides, h"'
placed a couple of timely hits to his
credit:
I. fake did not play with San Jose and
it is not liki !y that he will, as h.- fears
it will Interfere too much with his studies.
Borchera played first and pur up -a good
gnmo, while Fatty Kkiber, who is wear
ing one eye in deep mourning as the re-
EUlt of coming in violent contact with a
ball a few days ago, played Bhort. The
score:

Dr. A. T. Sanden's Electric Belt!
This has been before the public over a quarter of a century, and the cures it is working are tenfold greater than
ever. Men whom it cures are themselves astonished. It is practically a home treatmenc without medicines.
Letters of praise and gratitude pour in by the thousand. Men and women are restored after years of suffering, and
after other treatments have failed. It will cure KIDNEY TROUBLE, LAME BACK AND RHEUMATISM of io ; 20,
30 and 40 years' standing. Letters prove it. Other physicians indorse and use this Belt for their patients. Dr. S.
A. Mi'chie of Kauffrnan. Texas,. and Dr. J. W. Walker, Los Gatos, both certify to having used Dr. Sanden's Bel:
with successtul results in their practice. This is a simple and scientific remedy for all nervous and severe
di?ea es. It cures the pains and weakness incident to both man and woman. Dr. Sanden's method wonder-
fully restores Weak Nerves and Muscles, Varicocele. Bladder Affection, Vital Losses. Read this testimony and
judge therefrom:

Dr. Sanden's Belt is strongly made and easy to use; it is thorough in its work and heals while you rest,

every nerve in the body, and pours a warm, thrilling life current into the muscles and blood. Consult Dr. Sanden.

the minds of many old ringsfers that the

little game. Time, however, will tell the
story. It can be safely said, however, that
there will not be many .sports from thi?

because the majority of the home-rulers
opine that Jeffries will prove only a
punching bag for Fitz when the enlongat
ed champion will open tip his heavy tjuns
for the attack. Jeffries may be able to
hit a hard blow, but when he tries his pet
smashes at red-headed Bob he will find
nothing but empty space where he ex
pected to find the meat of the thing.

The schedule of games for the season is
I as follows:
NOT A SINGLE HARE
ESCAPED THE DOGS
SHORT COURSES THE RULE AT
UNION PARK.
Extra Stake Is Finished Excepting
Three Races, but the Open Stake
Will Afford Sport.
The hares at Union .Park did not show '
an improvement in their running yester
day. In fact, during the day not a sin
gle short-tall "flyer" made his escape. i
The races were all of a sprinting kind j
and as a result the dogs that "had the j
foot" won the colors of victory.
The talent had a prosperous day, as
with few exceptions the favorites won
easily. In the extra stake there was but j
one good short end, and that was the i
course between Nellie B and Winning j
Lassie. In the open. stake Safeguard beat '
For Glory, a 1 to 2 shot; Ski beat The
Exile, a 2 to 2}<, shot, and Ben Bolt beat
Flying Buck, a 3 to 1 shot. The new dogs
or. rather, the recent arrivals from for- !
eign lands, did not Impress the talent fa- i
vorably with their uerformances Mfts- V.
tei Gordon, however, did fairly well con- |
sidering that it was his first appearance .
in public in this country, and an eve '
should be kept on him, as he showed con- I
sidera'ble dash. Longford, another recent â¢
arrival, made a very poor showing. He
did not score in his race with Log Boy.
rhe Deacon started off at a very slow
pace from the slips, but when he- com- :
menced to realize that there was game
in front of him he got in and did very
fair work at the finish. Mose was as
stlfr as a poker an< made a very poor '
showing with Magic.
The O X Capitol and St. Michael race !
displeased a large number of spectators
Who could not understand why Judge Buli 1
did not award the course to at. Michael
The dogs were slipped to a hare that :
was running near the fence on the south
side of the Held, and St. Michael left his
line and ran cunning, evidently expecting
that O X Capitol would head off his game
and then he would come fn for the kill
The hare turned back suddenly as O X
Capitol dashed at it when under" full speed
and St. Michael then took charge, work
ing his game for several wrenches and a
kill finally. The judge did not consider
that O X Capitol had had a fair show un
der the circumstances and decided a "no
course" as the result of poor ludgment
displayed by th< slipper. In the run off
O X Capitol won handsomely.
The judge, however, gave two decisions
which were apparently off color. In fact,
old and experienced coursing men were
surprised at them. These were the races
between Phyllis and Santa Ana and Hard
Lines and Little Joker.
Phyllis led Santa Ana from the slips,!
and, with the exception of two wrenches,
did not allow Santu Ana to score; yet the \
brindle bitch got the flag. Jn the Hard j
Lines and Little Joker course Little Joker I
led from slip, but Hard Ljnes was tirst
to take the turn and scored points rapidly
on his opponent, allowing Little Joker to
come In for a wrench and turn at the
finish, then Hard Lines made the kill; but
Little Joker got the flag, nevertheless.
The run-down and two rounds of the
extra stake were finished yesterday, and
also the run-down of the open stake. The

OREMUS PROVED
NO MATCH FOR
GOLDEN RULE
Corrigan's Two-Year-
Old Won Easily.
FAVORITES RAN TO FORM
STAMINA BEATEN WITH EASE
BY DAISY F.
The Books Were Hard HitâGibbetti
flibbet Was a Good Thing âRapido
Finally Scored âJenkins on
Three Winning Mounts.
Golden Rule, the crack two-year-old of
the Corrigan stable, continued in his tri
umphant, career at Oakland track yes
terday, capturing the stake event at five
furlongs without apparent effort. Many
of the spectators were greatly disappoint
ed, for they expected to see Charles
Fair's Ormonde filly, Oremus, give the
chestnut youngster a sharp argument.
She was unequal to the task, and after
displaying a high turn of speed during
the early stages of the running was
beaten for the place by Kitty Kelly, the
only other contender. Golden Rule had
Piggott at the helm, and, closing a 2 to
6 chance in the books, cut out the pace
and won hands down in 1:02. The value
of the stake was $1000 to the winner.
Aside from this one event the programme
wore the earmarks of one that would be
furnished at some bush meeting up in
the pumpkin country. Five favorites
tumbled in, and the ring suffered severe
losses.
The mile and a furlong handicap was
a grand piece of work. It was superb be
cause of its coarseness. John Carroll, the
nephew of Ed Corrigan, started Daisy
F with 104 pounds up. Duke & Wishard
were represented by Stamina, carrying
102 pounds. The pair met once before,
and the latter colt won. The other start
ers were Outright and Morana, "dogs"
that could not win an October derby, and
Ringmaster. The books opened Stamina
a :! to 5 favorite, but were soon intro
duced to the angle. The Middle Western
delegation spread their coin about on
Carroll's mare, forcing the odds down
from 7 to 5 to 3 to 5. She waited on Stam
ina until the stretch was reached, and
then actually rolled in winner. Stamina,
whose price went back to 6 to 5, was
lame in the shoulder and apparently in
no condition for a hard contest. Local
turf patrons paid the piper, and the
Chicago outfit danced to the music, as
well as carting away the coin.
Major Hooker experienced no difficulty
in disposing of the motley gathering of
"crabs" in the first event, a mile and a
quarter run. The r;tce was made for him,
and at odds of 1 to 2 he won galloping
from Formella. Cavallo, the second
choice, finished fourth, behind Reolia.

TRACK NOTES
Bookmaker Barney Schreiber will leave
for St. Louis to-night. Barney lias some
two-year-olds In the Eastern country that
he expects big things of and is very anx
ous to see how they shape up.
Jockey Joe Piggott will depart for St.
Louis to-morrow evening. Joe can hold
his own in any company and will win his
share of mounts.
Gibbettiflibbet. which was made thp
nn'ilium of a "killing." is trained by Peter
Weber. The veteran horseman has carved
watermelons before and made no mis
takes.
If Jenkins will keep away from the
"shell men" he will have quite a following
when he moves his tackle over the other
side of the Rockies.
THE BEST TKOUT STREAMS.
Waters Where Anglers Have Creeled
Some Very Nice Fish Recently.
The Fly Casting Club will hold contests
this forenoon at Stowe Lake, in Golden
Gate Park, and the annual club dinner
will be held next Tuesday evening. An
glers will be pleased to learn that trout
fishing in the coast streams that have not
been destroyed by the dynamite fiends is
improving rapidly. The past week of
warm weather in the country has had
much to do with the happy turn in affairs
piscatorial. At Point Reyes some very
nice fish have been caught in the tide
waters during the past week by local
anglers who paid the stream a visit. The
black gnat, royal coachman and March
brown appc-ar to be the best killers. The
fish are keeping in the deep water and
well out from the bank. Unless an angler
cm cast a long line, using delicacy and
accuracy in the handling of the rod, he
may just as well remain at home, as the
trout are very shy and not easily decoyed.
Mr. Finch returned from the San Lo
renzo River last Monday with a nice bas
ket of ten-inch trout, which were taken
during the heavy rain on Sunday last.
He reports that there are many nice trout
in the Lorenzo which will afford anglers
good sport when the weather settles.
Of the coast streams the most flattering
information comes from San Gregorio. A
local angler, writing from San Gregorio,
states that the lagoon contains many
large grilse and that in a few hours' fish
ing he landed three that scaled respec
tively 8, 4% and 5 pounds. Small fish are
also plentiful.
Anglers who were given permission to
fish on Pilarcitos Lake last Sunday re
turned disgusted with their luck and a
drenching to boot. They state that the
fish will not rise to a fly and that it is
a very difficult thing to bait fish owing
to the heavy slime and thick accumula
tion of weeds, which stretch from the
bank well into the lake. As there is but
one boat for anglers, the situation can
be easily imagined. The trout caught
gave very poor resistance; in fact they
are not fit for a place in an angler's bas
ket. So much for Lake Pilarcitos.
John Butler. Frank Marcus and Lloyd
Eaton enjoyed a first-class day's sport
on Thursday last on Lagunitas Lake,
which is the property of the San Rafael
Water Company. A small spinner and a
black gnat caught the fancy of the deni
zens, which on an average were ten
inches in length.
Yesterday afternoon a party of ang
lers consisting of Joe Rogers, Emil Me
deau, Tom Moran, E. Cahill, E. Evatt
mid Joe Ross journeyed from this city to
San Gregorio, where they expect to have
excellent sport to-day with the steelheads
now "camped" in the lagoon. Doubtless
there will be stories told on their return
of how the big fishes smashed heavy
tackle, all because of bad management
on the part of the man who hold the rod
Mr. Coutts, a well-known trainer of
dogs, states that the reason for the very
poor fishing on Sonoma Creok is because
of the low state of the water In the past
two winters and the amount of spearing
that is indulged in during the breeding
seasons by men who live near the creek
in the vicinity of Glen Ellen. Coutts says
that the spearmen take a delight in tell
i ing their friends of the many fishes th*v
I kill with the spear. The Supervisors cf

Clay
My experience has led me to believe that
landlords are not wise. They seem to think
that if a merchant is prosperous in the char
ters he lease? from them, his prosperity is due
to the fact that, he is occupying their building.
That is not the case. It is the merchant him
self who creates the business, who Rives value
to the place and therefore every time his rent
is raised that raise is a tax Imposed upon him
by his own individual effort. This is borne
out by the fact that day street, which is yet
in embryo as a business thoroughfare, has
some houses which are doing a most thriving
business.
Washington street landlords seem to ba fall
!nj? into the same error as have landlords in
ether sections. A merchant, who several years
ago took reiuge on that street between Eighth
and Ninth from exorbitant demands for rent
on another street, is on the eve of moving. A
demand lor a rental of 5125 a month Is made
upon him, which Is nearly twice as much as
he paid when he took possession of the place
a few years ago.
Several years apo a man opened up a line
of business in a small store on the north side
of Eleventh street, between Broadway and
Washington street. An I jcemenl was of
fered the tradesman to takt possession of the
place, the rent, 1 believe, starting at *:'.:> a
month. The man attracted trade. According
ly. as trade came the landlord raised the rent,
until it came Close to $S0 per month. The mer
chant couldn't stand it. The building was old
and ragged and dirty. It never drew a custo
mer. It was 'the merchant himself who at
tracted trade. He moved to Washington street
and the store on Eleventh street Is vacant and
has been so for nearly two years.
I know of Etill another case. It was on
j Washir.gton Btreet, between Thirteenth and
Fourteenth. The merchant was paying a good
! round rental He found that the street cars
were so numerous and close to the curb that
| the heavy carriat business trade which he
had previously enjoyed wus being destroyed.
People would not risk stopping in Â»ront of his
store and orders went elsewhere. The mer
chant asked for a reduction of the rent. The
request was denied. The merchant found a
I store on Thirteenth street for half the nt, se
cured him nil the accommodations he required,
brought back his old customers and he is now
doing better business and paying lees rent than
I ever.

and one world's recordâ that of the twelve

These marked the annual field day of St.
Mary's College on the campus this after
noon. The college lÂ».md enlivened the in
termissions and the events went off with
out a hitch. There was not an accident,
unless the fainting spell of O. La Valliere,
who came in second in the one mile run,
might be regarded as approaching one,
and in the 220-yard hurdle McDonough
fell.
The crowning feature of the day was
the hammer throwing of the world's
champion, Tom Carroll. Carroll threw a
twelve pound hammer 217 feet, breaking
his previou record of 2Â«5 feet made about
three years ago. He took three throws.
The first trial reach< 225 feet into the
field, but he had tepped the mark

FOUNDERS' DAY AT MILLS.
Presidents Kellogg and Jordan and
Dr. Coyle Speak.
OAKLAND, May 6.â Founders' daywaa
celebrated at Mills College to-day. The
Institution waÂ« 29 years old, and Mrs. C.
T. Mills, one of the founders, was sur
rounded by scores of the alumni of the
college.
Dr. H. C. Minton of the board of trus
tees presided over the exercises, and
after an opening chorus by the students
Rev, Dr. Coyle made an address. He
outlined in brief the progress of the in.sti
tion from the time of its founding by
Dr. and Mrs. Mills, and referred to the
vast Influence for good that the education
of more than one generation must have
exercised on society at large.
President Jordan of Stanford University
followed with a short address, and was I
succeeded by President Martin Kellogg of |
the State University. The latter paid a
high compliment to the manner In which
the students were prepared, as was i
proven by their excellent showing when
they take the entrance examinations at

MRS. PICETTI'S
NOSE BROKEN
BY A BRICK
Thinks Her Life Is in
Danger.
MR. WEISENHAVEN IN COURT
NEIGHBORS WOULD LIKE TO
SEE HIM IN JAIL.
A Host of Witnesses in Judge
Quinn's Court Lose and Regain
Their Memories Mys
teriously.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,'
908 Broadway, May 6.
Judge Quinn has at last decided a case
that has disturbed the cordial relations
betwi en two factions in a certain part
of Berkeley for over a year. A. Weisen
haven has been discharged and Mrs. Pl
cettl is without remedy other than the
sympathy of neighbors for the pain of a
nose broken, she alleges, by a brick
thrown by Mr. Weisenhaven.
Although the case was not one of
marked gravity, enough influence exist
ed to keep it from trial for more than a
year, and although the feeling between
the factions has Bteadily increased many
of the witnesses when on the stand would
answer nothing but "I don't know."
The Btory of Miss Louise PicettJ was
very tragic. The young lady told of how
her mother had met Weisenhaven at
Mrs. McGee's gate and how he had point
ed a screwdriver at her heart, threaten
ing to kill her, besides throwing a' brick,
bitting her mother onthe face and break
-1 ing her nose. A year ago the young,
testified that Weisenhaven had thrown
1 two bricks at her mother, but in the long
i interval she had forgotten altogether
i about one of the bricks.
The witness most interesting to the
court was Mrs. Andrade, who did not re
member anything. She "did not know"
anything, except some things she did not
i remember.
"You had no conversation with â Weisen
i haven, madam?" said the prosecuting at
torney. "Well, what did he say to you.
"He said he was sorry he had broken
Mrs. Plcetti's nose," said the witness.
Then the court and all the attorneys
wanted to know whethi r th< witness was
telling the truth now or when she said she
had talked with nobody. Mrs. Andrade
winced under the indignation of all
hands and narrowly escaped having to
answer for contempt of ourt.
From some of the testimony it ap
peared that Weisenhaven, who is pretty
well-to-do, has many enemies in his
neighborhood, and some more warrants
may be issued. There is a desire In
some quarters that he change his resl
dence and that he be punished for all
sorts of alleged offenses, but the evidence
so far has not convinced the jurors that
he is guilty of any crime worthy of im
prisonment. After being locked up for two
hours the jurors were evenly balanced as
to thi prisoner's guilt or innocence and
' Judge Qulnn discharged him.

Free Trial Package of This New Discovery
Mailed to Every Man Sending Name
and Address â Quiokly Restores
Strength and Vigor.
Free trial packages of a mrst remarkable
remedy are being mailed to all who will writ*
the State Medical Institute. They cured so
many men who had battled for yt-ars against
the mental and physical suffering of lost man-
hood that the Institute has decided to distribute
freo trial packages to all who write. It Is a
home treatment and all men who suffer with
any form of sexual weakness resulting from
youthful folly, premature loss of strength and
memory, weak back, varicocele or .aclation
of parts can now cure themselves at home.
The remedy has a peculiarly grateful effect
of warmth and seems to act direct to the de-
sired location, giving strength and development
j lust where it Is needed. It cures all the ills
â  and troubles that come from years of misuse
of the natural functions and has beon an ab-
solute success in all cases. A request to the
Btata Medical Institute, 743 First National
Hank building. Fort Wayne. Ind.. stating that
you desire one of their free trial packages, will
| be complied with promptly. The Institute Is
desirous of reaching that great class of men
who are unable to leave home to be treated
and the free sample will enable them to see
how easy It Is to be cured of Eetcual weakness
â when the proper remedies are employed. The
Institute ma.kes no restrictions. Any man who
1 writes will be sent a free sample, carefully
sealed In a plain package, so that its recipient
need have no fear of embarrassment or pub-
licity. Readers are requested to write without
d*la.v.
giving the carnival would be so abundantly
swelled that Oakland would make a re
markable showing at the 1300 celebration.
Hon. George C. Pardee next spoke on
behalf of Oakland Parlor as a charter
member. In the name of Oakland Parlor
he welcomed the visitors, thus conclud
ing the opening ceremonies.
The various beautifully ornamented
booths were w.ell patronized during the
evening, and if to-night's attendance is a
forerunner of what is to be expected dur
ing the week the affair will have proved
a glowing success. The music, which was
excellent and proved a decided feature,
was rendered by Bennett's band.

TOOK A REEF
IN THE STOMACH
OF A FISHERMAN
Nautical Cure for In
digestion.
THE PATIENT IS RECOVERING
FIRST OPERATION OF THE KIND
IN SURGERY.
John Tohakka,Who Was Dying From
Dilation of the Stomach Caused
by Chronic Indigestion,
Is Cured.
Since the early days of navigation sailor
men have been In the habit of taking a
reef in a sail when the storm was stronger
than the ship could stagger under with all
her canvas spread, but for the first time
in the medical history of the world a
"reef" has been taken In a man's stom
ach. There is no medical term that cov
ers the operation, so the doctor who per
formed it simply calls it what It wasâ
'"taking a reef in a dilated stomach."
On March 25 last John Tohakka, a na
tive of Finland, aged 4S years, was ad
mitted to St. Mary's Hospital suffering
from a very bad case of chronic Indiges
tion. He is n fisherman, and his irregu
lar mode of life brought on the trouble
Some time ago his stomach began to
swell, and when he was admitted to the
hospital he looked as though he was suf
fering from dropsy. The case was aa-
signed to Dr. Georffe Childs Macdonald
and he diagnosed it as "chronic Indiges
tion. For three weeks Tohakka was
tr â¢. ted .. ln a m Â°st skillful manner, but
while his general health improved the di
lation of his stomach got worse, If any
thing. *
Nearly .three weeks ago Dr. Macdonald
decided that In order to effect a cure the
stomach would have to be restored to its
normal size. Drugs would not effect the
object aimed at. so the knife and needle
had to Ix3 s brought into use. Tohakk.i had
the situation explained to him and readily
agreed to have the operation performed.
After be ng put under the influence of an
anesthetic the "reef was taken in the
distended organ and Tohakka is now al
most a* well as ever again.
The "reef consists of a double fold
which was carefully sewed together. This
reduced the or pan to almost its normal
size. The opening made in the body was
then closed up and made secure and the
patient was put back to bed. He began to
improve at once, and In a short time was
able to be up and about. He can now
dipest his food, and yesterday made a
hearty meal of roast chicken. In a few
days he will be in a condition to leave the
hospital, and Dr. Macdonald says he will
!â¢Â« able to follow his usual vocation aa
though nothing had happened.
CITED FOR CONTEMPT.
Board of Education Must Appear in
Court and Show Cause.
The entire Board of Education has been
summoned by Judge Hunt to appear In
his department of the Superior Court on
Monday morning at 10 o'clock and show
cause why they should not be punished
for contempt of court for refusing to
obey a writ of mandate issued out of the
court ordering them to pay E. C. Kil
patrlck, principal of the Business Even
ing School, his salary from February
1898, to the present date. The writ was
issued April 10, and on the same day the
board passed a resolution authorizing the
payment of Kilpatrick's salary "out of
any unexpended balance of any of the
board funds." As there was no unex
pended balance Kilpatrick alleges that
the resolution was In violation of the
court's order, and consequently on his
affidavit the order to show cause was is
sued.
The board was to have met in special
session yesterday, but as the summons
to show cause had been issued the mem
bers of the board "made themselves
scarce," only four appearing, and all mat
ters that were to have been settled went
over indefinitely.

Second Trial of Book
maker Jones.
OBJECTIONS TO THE VENIRE
THEY ARE ALL SWEPT ASIDE BY
JUDGE GROEZINGER.
All Afternoon Taken Up in Selecting
the Jury and the Hearing
Will Take Place To-
Morrow.
The second trial of H. L. Jones, the
bookmaker, charged with violating the
new ordinance against poolselling by sell
ing pools at the Ingleside racetrack, was
commenced before acting Police Judge
Groezinger and a jury yesterday after
noon.
At the first ferial before Judge Mogan
the jury stood ten for acquittal and two
for conviction. Judge Mogan, from the
fact that his eaJendar was overcrowded,
transferred the c;tses to Judge Groezin
ger, and against the protest of Attorney
Ach the case of Jones was again set first
for trial.
A venire of 100 jurors had been served,
and Attorney Ach at once adopted the
bame tactics as before Judge Slogan. He
began by challenging the venire, and put
Officers O'Keefe and O'Meara under oath,
asking them innumerable questions as to
how they selected the men, from whom
they received their instructions, were any
of the men related to them and had they
any business dealings with them, and so
on. The challenge was denied.
Then because one of the initials in one
of the names was apparently wrong he
again challenged the venire, as the full
liw had not been summoned. This was also
denied, and Ach took the usual exceptions.
Ach insisted that all the names should
be called out to see if the jurors would
answer to their names. This was done,
and about twenty-five out of the 100 did
not answer. Ach again moved that the
jury be dismissed, as the full number had
not answered, and the defendant was en
titled to have the whole 100 names put in
the box. Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter
cornered him by asking if he demanded a
continuance and thereby put the jurors to
the unnecessary Inconvenience of coming
another day. He declined to look upon
his motion that way, and the Judge
promptly denied it. Then he took excep
tion to the Judge having excused two
iurors in the morning without consulting
him. Finally the Judge ordered attach
ments issued against the defaulting jurors
and the first twelve men were called to
the box.
It took all afternoon to select the
twelve, as there were so many objections,
and the case was continued for trial till
to-morrow afternoon at 1 o'clock. The
names of the twelve jurors are; D. W.
Landers, Solomon Newman, Louis Ehn-n
--berg, M. J. Bohannon, E. E. Myers, Chris
Helnv, C. A. Tleweger, A. Mr-Mahon H
A. Berkelman. S. F. Weeks, J. A. Miller
and M. A. Judd.
While questioning: the jurors Attorney
Aoh would ask. "Do you know the Ingle'
sldo racetrack?" "Do you know that a
number of valuable Imorovcments have
been made there?" "Do you know that
a large number of men * are employed
there?" When it came to Prosecuting At
torney Carpenter's turn he would ask the
Juror: "Do you know the State's prison?"
"Do you know that a large number of
prisoners are there through betting at
the racetrack?" Attorney Ach strenuous
ly, objected to Carpenter's questions, but
he contended he had as much right to
ask them aa Ach had to ask about the
improvements at the Ingleside track and
the number of men employed there.

NEW ZEALAND BISHOP HEKE.
Will Visit Ireland With Two Secular
Priests.
Bishop Michael Verdon of New Zealand

returning to the scene of their ecclesiasti
cal labors.
Bishop Verdon has been at the head of
the diocese of Dunedin for the past three
years. Previous to being consecrated
Bishop he was president of the Manly

MAMMY PLEASANT ANGEL OR ARCH FIEND
IN THE HOUSE OF MISTERY ?
Auctioning Off Mammy Pleasant's Services as Cock.
In ISSO, when the ship arrived in port which brought Mammy Pleasant and other pibneera around Cape Horn, the wealthy merchants
and miners ra-ced to the water front to engage her Bervices, as she was heralded as one of the grreal Southern cooks. So many gentlemen
wanted her the thnuÃht it only fair that they should 'bid for hor services, and she would work for the highest Mddor.
So the bidding hepan, while Mammy stood on the fleck with folded arms and placidly looked on while the figures ran up Into the hun
dreds. Finally the ita reached 1500 &Jid everybody seemed to think that was about fair pay per month for a cook, even if she was the best
one. that ever came out of the South.
But Mammy had her own ideas of the value of her services, just as she had on so many occasions afterward.
"There's to be no washing," she stipulated. The delighted purchaser of her services nodded.
"Not even dish washing," she added. Another nod of acquit set
But when the lucky bidder offered at once to escort her with becoming pomp to hia bachelor's quarters and install her as goddess of the
cook Stove Mammy suddenly folded her arms and calmly announced that she had changed her mind. She declared all bids off and said she'd
takÂ» time, think the matter over and would let them know later what she proposed doing.
HE "house of mystery" has lost Its most mysterious character.
T "Mammy" Plrasant and Mrs. 801 l have separated.
For the first time in twenty years greedy ears and prying
eyes have been rewarded. Curious neighbors have at last
had a peep behind the shroud of mystery that has settled
like a pall over the Bell home, on the corner of Pine and
Octavia stre<
i Mammy Pleasant's exit was in keeping with her role of
the most mysterious mystery in the house of mysteries. She
did not leave in gaudy daylight, nor yet under the shadow of black
night, but In the dusk, which, according to any and every yellow-
Tback novei, Is the hour of hours for weird scenic effect.
She did not announce her departure to the neighbors in the ap
proved "blue-book" manner. Instead, they heard a voice that rane
lharsh on th" ni^ht air despite the soft Southern accent, "Let me out!
â Let me out! Mrs. Bell has locked me In her room! Let me out!"
Silhouetted against the topmost window of the "house of mys
tery" was the figure of Mami Pleasant.
A few moments and the big doors swung open and Mammy
Pleasant walked down the stairs, escorted on either side by a police
men. In the selfsame bonnet and plaid shawl which she wears in
fair weather and in foul, to millionaire's palace and to pauper's
hovel, with head erect and gliding step she left the house where
for twenty years she has been the dictator.
The officers of the law, having performed their duty In removing
â¢her from the house, allowed Mammy to take her way unescorted.
Long before she reached the home of her friend, Mrs. Ferry, on
Webster street, the lights had been put out, 'the shutters drawn, and
the "house of mystery" had relapsed into Its usual Impenetrable
aspect.
"Mrs. Bell and Mrs. Pleasant have quarreled," say the uninitiated.
"Mrs Bell and Mrs. Pleasant have simply separated," say the in
itiated.
"Mammy Pleasant has lost her influence over Mrs. Bell," affirm
the disinterested.
k "Mammy Pleasant Is using her influence over Mrs. Bell," assert
the Interested ones.
"Mammy Pleasant has played her last card," say the wise ones.
"Mammy Pleasant is playing her trump card," protest the wiser
ones.
Only time can decide which" is right. Â Perhaps Mrs. Bell and
"Mammy" have really quarreled. But more likely they have seem
ingly seperated at Mammy's instigation and for a purpose. As one
of the wiser ones explained it: "You see creditors are anxiously and
eagerly eying the estate with a view to the payment of their bills.
Mammy Pleasant denies that she ever ordered the goods charged.
Mrs. Bell declares that she never received any of them. As purchaser
and receiver of the goods they are equally responsible for the debts.
But they refuse to assume either of these titles, nor does Mr. Bell
accuse Mammy of being both purchaser and receiver. They dis
claim any responsibility, in the matter. And their denial smacks more
of being genuine when they are supposed to be strangers and ene
mies and no longer warm allies."
So there are those who thus interpret Mammy's last move. They
â¢will not believe that her influence over Mrs. Bell has waned. They
ascribe her forcible ejecture as a clever guise to give the affair a
realistic air and to satisfy Mammy's love for the spectacular.
On the other hand there are those who believe that Mrs. Bell
has finally awakened to the fact that she has been as putty in
Mammy's hands; that the evidence offered at the trial last year
took root in her mind and that Mammy's dismissal Is the result.
At that trial Fred Bell endeavored to, prove that Mrs. Bell was
incompetent to manage the estate or to have charge of the Bell
children. The family skeleton was dragged into full light for the
public eye.
Charges and counter charges were made. Mammy Pleasant was
cused of being a black leech who had fastened herself on the Bell
money sack until It was as dry as a sucked orange. Mrs. Pleasant
was held up as the faithful black "mammy," who was constant to
the end, whose hand went deep into her private pocket that her
mistress might have luxuries. She was pictured as a black crook, a
heartless wretch. She was painted whiter than the lilies of the field,
as kind as the angels of mercy.
The Bell family, cave Fred Bell, saw naught tut shining .virtues
In Mammy despite evidence calculated to make them think to the
contrary. The door of the "house of mystery" v/as barrel! to the
oldesl Bon of the houst i>f Bell. The latchkey was reintrusted to
Mammy. In fact sh< had not even during the trial relinquished any
of her rights as dictator.
Qntil her departure last week it was thought that Mrs. Pleasant
would reign as absolute monarch until the end. Those who know
her best still think her power is supreme. Even Fred Hell, who has
been readmitted to his mother's presence since Mammy's departure,
is doubtful as to th" genuineness of the quarrel.
Mammj Pleasant's lasi experience, real or studied, is a fitting
climax tn a life that would seem Impossible even between the covers
i>f a book. She came to California. In '50. There was a price <>n her
h^ad in the South and she wanted to i^et as far away fr->m home as
possible. Hei connection with the "underground railway" was an
established fact and planters whose slaves she had helped cross the
border to ih" fret North demanded her life as a recompense.
In the early tifties "a ship coming in through the Golden Onto"
we* a far rarer and more welcome sight in San Francisco than a
gold nugget. So when the vessel on which Mrs. Pleasant was a
passenger around Cape Horn put Into th â  harbor all of tent-co
San Francisco was there to welcome it.
When the rich merchants, richer miners and Rood livers In town
heard that there was a colored girl on the vessel and that she was
"one of the greatest cooks that ever came out of the South" there
was an excited and tumultuous scramble to engage her services.
Tom Bell, Bill Sharon and a lot of other wealthy men held nut well
filled wallets as a bonus. But shrewd Mammy Pleasant held back;
so many gentlemen wanted her she thought it only fair that they
should bid for her services and she would work for the highest bidder.
So the bidding began while Mammy stood on the deck with folded
arms and placidly looked on while the figures ran up into the hun
dreds. Finally the sum reached $500 and everybody seemed to think
that was about fair pay for a cook, even if she was the best one that
ever came out of the South.
But Mammy had her own Ideas of the value of her services, Just
as she had on so many occasions afterward.
"There's to be no washing." she stipulated.
The delighted purchaser of her services nodded.
"Not even dish washing," she added.
Another nod of acquiescence.
But when the lucky bidder offered at once to escort her with
becoming pomp to his bachelor's quarters and install her as goddess
of the cook stove Mammy suddenly folded her arms and calmly an
nounced that she had changed her mind. She declared all bids off
and said she'd take time, think the matter over and would let them
know what she proposed doing.
As she was the only cook that had come to town on that vessel
the crestfallen millionaires, nabobs of provision houses and land
burdened philosophers were obliged to wend their ways sadly saloon
ward or across lots and wait for the autocrat of the cook stove to
make up her mind.
Mammy took a room in town. Next day the plutocracy of the
town were informed by notes that the new cook had determined to
open up a boarding-house bo that not any one particular man could
monopolize her table dishes, but all good men could enjoy them.
Twice in the years that followed Mammy Pleasant moved her
house. Some of her clientele had lost their money, others had doubled
and trebled their fortunes. They had become prominent in business
or in the affairs of state. Whether they had married or remained
single they came to Mammy Pleasant for advice. Black or white
no other woman in this State has ever had the confidence 1 of so
many of its prominent menâ and no other woman has ever helped in
the exposing and concealing of so many family skeletons.
People marveled at her Intelligence and at the total lack of the
usual characteristics of her race. Her skin was as black as ebony,
but her features were not those of a negress. Many said that she
was half Indian and she never disclaimed it. There was none of the
cringing, whining slnvo about her. She dictated to every one who
came In contact with her.
In those days Mammy's chief delight was matchmaking. Thomas
Bell was interested in a protege of Mrs. Pleasant'e. That that pro
tege was already provided with a husband did not disconcert Mammy.
The first Incumbent was given hl3 walking papers and Mr. Bell, with
The Last Scene In the House of Mystery.
Mammy Pleasant ordered out of the house where she had controlled affairs for over twenty years. During that period so many sensa
tional and mysterious events occurred there that the place acquired the title of the "House of Mystery."
a marriage license, undertook his duties. Half a dozen ethers were
likewise mated or misrnated by Mammy.
Then Cupid growing shy Mammy gave up her place and moved
her household gods to another quarter. All sorts of idle and ugly
rumors floated around. It was said that she dug pitfalls into which
unheeding girls could stumble. It was at this time that Mrs. Pleasant
met Sarah Althea Hill.
After a year <>r two Mrs. Pleasant went to act as housekeeper
in the home of Thomas Bell. She took absolute charge of all the
domestic arrangements. All money matters between Mr. and Mrs.
Bell were arranged by Mommy. Every day, in the long period when
events ran smoothly, Bell handed her $100 for the usual household
expenses. Outside of this Mammy frequently visited his office to
get a check for two or three thousand dollars for special things
needed by Mrs* Bell. That is. Mammy always explained them that
way, and Millionaire Bell was a generous provider for his family.
All ihe household money passed through her hands, even the pocket
money for the children.
She is supposed to have used a great deal of it on the Sharon
case and when still more was needed she succeeded in making Mr.
Bell personally advance it
In the height of his financial power Bell was reputed to be worth
$10,000,000; when he died his estate was appraised at $2,500,000, and
now there is a struggle among the heirs and creditors to get the
pickings of what is left.
Her motives in the Sharon case, like all her other deeds, are open
to argument. Her enemies say that she thought Sarah Althea would

get a million, half or all of which she herself would finally obtain.
Her friends say it was friendship untainted by mercenary motives
that prompted her.
Until Mr. Bell's sudden and mysterious death about seven years
ago Mammy's position in the Bell household was never questioned.
Fred Bell, the eldest son, first took th<- bit between his teeth
and chafed under the high hand with which "Mammy" held the
household reins. The other children and Mis. Bell sided with Mammy.
The Bells became financially embarrassed. Where was the money
going? People said that "Mammy" was giving it with lavish hand
to her innumerable proteges and retainers. It was even whispered
that she could tell something of a hand that had helped Thomas Bell
In his fall over the banisters which resulted in his death.
When several years later Fred Bell was found in a crippled heap
at the foot of the stairs in a house of one of Mrs. Pleasant's re
tainers, the accusing finger was again uplifted. Fred Bell himself
was too much under the influence of liquor to remember how the
accident happened.
After the trial last year the court ordered thnt the four younger
children be sent to boarding school. Marie, the oldesi daughter, re
turned to the "house of mystery" with her mother and Mammy
Pleasant. What happened no one knows, but one day RJarie parked
her things and went to live with friends. Since that day she has
never seen or spoken to her mother. But she remained as completely
under Mammy's control as though they were under the same roof.
Mammy saw her constantly and is thought to have used her influence
with both Mrs. Bell and Marie to widen the breach between them.
To-day the inmates of the "house of mystery" are Bcattered to
the four corners. Mammy Pleasant is living in one part of the city,
In still another lives Marie Bell.
In a flat out near Golden Gate Park Fred Bell is keeping house
with his young wife. The other children are at school. Only Mrs.
Bell, with a blind old man to wait upon her, remains in the "house
of mystery."
If Mrs. Pleasant has property or money she has safely concealed
It under other people's names. Her's is not the greed of accumulation.
it ifl the greed for the power of distribution and expenditure. If she
has ducats hidden away they are down so deep that not even the
lawyers can find them. The general belief Is that she has dissipated
into thin air not only all her own money, but almost all the money
. entrusted to her by other people.
"Mammy Pleasant has the evil eye," said a man who has known
her long and well. "Every one who has ever come under it has met
with unhappiness and misfortune. For Sarah Althea, the bars of
the madhouse, and'for Mrs. Bell, utter and absolute loneliness and the
faculties still left to realize it. The other womenâ and their name ia
legionâ life lines have been closely entwined with Mammy's
have likewise gathered but the fruit of the dead sea.
"Mammy is an incomprehensible mixtureâ a generous giver and
taker, not only of her own but of other people's possessions. She
has not a spark of affection, nor an atom of conscience. She is the
smoothest talker and the shrewdest woman in San Francisco. She
is childish in her vanities, diabolical in her schemings. A woman to
whom the feeling of power is the breath of life, and one who realizes
that it is money that gives power. An intellectual giant, but a
moral idiot."
"Mammy Pleasant is the dearest old thing," said the girl who Is
Marie Bell's intimate friend. "If you knew her and talked to her
you'd never believe all the lies people tell. Do you suppose â¢ Marie

NEW WOMEN OF THE WEST.
ARIZONA, April 3.â Several hun
dred women on the desert plains
and among the mountains and
canyons in the Southwest Territo
ries deserve to be well up to
ward the top of the catalogue of
those who have succeeded in fields of hu
man energy for years occupied exclusive
ly by men. While women in the cities
and more populous parts of the Union are
winning success in the professions, in
business, and in trades, alongside of their
husbands and brothers, there are women
ir. .-very part of the Territories who are
only adapting themselves to crude
and strange environments, but also win
ning fortune and fame in pursuits that
were thought to be out of the question
for women a dozen years ago. The immi
gration into the Territories in the last two
decades from New England and the Mid
dle States has developed many a heroine.
An army of young women, carefully and
tenderly reared in old-fashioned homes in
the East, have come out here with hus
bands and brothers, and when they have
adapted themselves to their new situa
tions and nerved themselves to a brave
struggle for a livelihood in a strange
land, remote from everything connected
with their early training, some pictur
esque and extraordinary results have
been brought about.
For instance, there is the case of Mrs.
Marlon Phelps, who has become an ex
cellent gold mining prospector In the
Chloride and White Hills region in Mo-
Jave County, Arizona. Ex-Governor
Wolfley of Arizona Is authority for the
statement that she is as good a judge
as there is in the Southwest of the value
of ledges of low grade gold ore. Her hus
band was a graduate of a NÂ»-w England
Foientifio school, and marrying when but
22 years of age, he came West with his
young wife. He soon sank all his little
fortune in a placer mine that had been
abundantly salted for hi.s benefit. His
wife tramped over the mountains, trav
eled across burning deserts, lived in' lone
ly canyons, camped on bleak and barren
mountain sides, slept in chaparral and
dwelt among Indians for several years,
while young Phelps searched for gold
jnines. Mrs. Phelps shared every hard
â hip with her husband, and in time she
developed Into a correct and quick ob
server of pay rock, and became as well
versed as any one in that region in "all
the formations of auriferous rocks, the j
Blant, frangibllity and dip of ledges. |
When her husbana fell from a cliff one i
day In Williams Canyon and was killed,
the young woman was left with two small j
children and a few dollars. During the i
years that she and her husband had been,
barely subsisting, while they prospected
for mines, neither of them had ever writ-"
ten to a relative in the East about fhelr I
condition and their struggle with pov-*
erty. Not a word did she write now
about her distress. Pride Is a* powerful
characteristic in the' woman of the j
West. ,% ' ; ;u~i*;Â£s v â  â¢
With th<Â» help of several miner friends, :
Mrs. Phelps built a rude eabiny .sufficient
for comfort in the semi-tropic latitudes !
of Arizona, and with her own hands cultl- j
vated an area of valley land about her
cabin. She gTew vegetables and made a
market for all she could raise at the mm- i
ing town of Kingman, a few. miles away.
She never lost her- interest In- seeking !
mines, and when hor children were a year
or two older and could be left with others
she went forth to prospect through YVi!

had once found evidence of . gold-bearing j
rock. She prospected there for several
weeks at a time during the summer; going- i
back to her cabin home occasionally to.
look after her children and their Indian"
squaw nurse and to cultivate anew her j
vegetable farm. ' Along in the fall she t
located two claims, selling one for $2000. , *
This gave her the capital she needed,
and from the day in March, 1893, when the
money was paid her, she has been an as- i
â ayer and an expert In low grade gold ;
quartz. Her opinions are sought after :
from Yuma to Albuquerque, and eh_e i
earns a prood competence every year In
fees from Eastern people, who have con
fidence that what she tells them about
gold mines is trustworthy. In some cases
she gets as high as $100 for a few days'
time. Her children are in school at
Phoenix.
Then there 1b Miss Amelia Dunn, who
Is regarded in the region of Holbrook,
Navajo County, as the most capable girl
cowboy In the Southwest. Every one tn
the Territories knows about 'Melie Dunn
ancLher success among cattle, and hardly
a fortnight passes that some new story
about Miss 'Melie's broncos and Tattle Is
not started on the rounds of the rural
press in Arizona and New Mexico. The
Dunns came from the vicinity of Elmira,
N. Y. Mr. Dunn, the father, was an in
vaJld with consumption, and he settled
at Deming and bought cattle, because
caring for them would earn him money
and keep him out of doors at the same
time. That was in 1877, when Miss 'Melie
was a little tot of a girl.
After a long and hard experience with
marauding Navajoes, who, at different
times, stole three-fourths of the little
herd of cattle on the Dunn ranch and in
timidated the family so that they died
a thousand deaths while barricaded for
a week at a time in the dug-out cellar
under the rude ranch home, Mr. Dunn
rounded up some 350 cattle. When Amelia
was 17 years old her father died. She
had been with him almost daily for sev
eral years in his rldee across the mesas, |
among the foothills and through arroyos,
so she was as well informed about the
cattle business as her father. It was nat- j
ural that wb,en he died she became his
successor. It took several years for the '
girl to develop good business senseâto
know beef values, when to sell her stock,
when to ship and how to graze her herd
most economically. She was apt, and
before she was 21 years old her opinion
was authority among the cattlemen in i
that region. Shje knows every detail of
the ranch work and has performed some j
part of all phases of the career of a cow- j
boy of the Southwest.
From 1889 to 1897 the years were gener
ally sorry ones for even experienced cat
tle ranchmen in the drougtit-srricken.
regions of the Southwest, but ilelle Dunn
had the foresight to drive her beeves to
valleys, where the herd fattened while
thousands of other cattle died of exhaus
tion and starvation. The young woman's
duties as vaquero and proprietor of some j
4â¬oo cattle, often take her 150 and 200 miles '
or more from home across sandy wastes j
and among the foothills and mountains,
as the cattle must, be kept moving to feed i
well. Frequently during the rainy eea
son some' of the cattle become ''mired In !
the .mud along cre.eka where they graze j
or *here they wade in to drink. Then i
com'efl the hardest part of the work. With !
true cowboy skill she throws the lariat
over the slender branching horns, while
the other end of the long- phenomenallly
strong rawhide rope is fastened to the <
saddle. Then a steady pull on the part of 'â¢
tha pony draws the imprisoned animal to
a pla.ee of safety on dry ground. She has
a large herd, for one person to handle, but
with the assistance of ' two well-trained
dogs she does it.
WJiile on the range'Mlss Dunn dresses
tin cpwboy fashion, with wide-brimmed '
white felt hat. long gauntlet gloves, a
lariat colled about the saddlehorn and a !
revolver at her belt, and she rides the I
wildest bronco with thorough ease. When
off duty she is a quiet, unassuming young
lady, the 'last one that would be sus- j
pected of such masculine accomplish
ments.
"1 only regre^," she said recently to a '
newspaper man, "that I have never had
an opportunity to gain any of â  the wo-j
manly accomplishments in the way of |
study, literature and music. I fear 1
would be laughed at by the yonng wo- i
men in the East if I should 1 go among
them. But I have made good money and j

for feminine- accomplishments."

west who are heroines not because they
have won success in new and extraordi
nary fields of labor or have overcome tre
mendous odds in the struggle for finan
cial reward. The daily experiences of
very many women in their frontier
homes are good reason for putting them
on the roll of honor. The people in the
upper Gila Valley, in Pinal County, have
never ceased telling: of a deed of rare
bravery done by Mrs. Victor Daniels
some twenty-five miles southwest of
Florence in the summer of 1883. The
Danielses came from New Jersey and set
tled on a cattle ranch, fifteen miles from
the nearest neighbor. Mrs. Daniels was
born and reared in Brooklyn, and soon
adapted herself in her new home to the
strange environment. Her husband had,
with great difficulty and constant
watchfulness got together a bunch of
cows, about fifty in all, and was endeav
oring to start a little herd. Mrs. Daniels
had the herding of thf>m, as well as the
care of the house. One day, when her
husband had gone twenty milÂ»\s to the
| store, she was compelled to leave the
I cattle grazing, while she looked after a
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN ACTRESS.
Miss Allen's experiences on the stage make her singularly well fitted to write intelligently of the life of an actress She has been
the leading lady member of two "stock" companies : those of the Boston Museum and the Empire Theater of New York. She has
supported the leading actors of the timeâ the elder Salvini, Joseph Jefferson, Lawrence Barrett, John McCullough and William J.
Florence. This year she made her success'u! debut as a "star" in Hall Came's dramatization of "The Christian."
TO be perfectly frank at the be
ginning, it should be stated that
an actressâ a true actress, I
mean â is born, not made. Why?
Because the chief qualities
which she must possess are born with
her; she must have health, strength, a
good physique, brains, aptitude, imagi
nation, memory and judgment. These
aside from a generous share of instinct
ive talent and a goodly quantity of
that indescribable and indefinable
something which we call magnetism.
Some of these essentials any girl will
at once' perceive are not to be cultivat
ed. Therefore is the true actress born
and not made. I have not placed per
sonal beauty In the category of essen
! tlals, because it is not an essential, but
!an indisputed aid. I say this because
I one need only to go over the list of the
| greatest actresses to see at once that
'they were not and are not all beautiful
women. Genius always rises above per
sonal beauty, but it must be true
genius. And as thore is so little of ab-
I solute genius in the world, an attract
ive face becomes an assistance to the
i actress.
In an educational way an actress can
scarcely have too thorough, too broad
or too complete a training. An intel
ligent actress, one who loves her art, is
never through Btudying and developing.
Therefore she must have a good mental
basis to begin with, and with It a de
sire to learn and constantly learn as
she progresses. To be more explicit,
the very least she can do with is the
j best of common school educations, and
with this a knowledge of languagesâ
' French at least. She must have an
; aptness for music, as she is liable at
j any time to be sailed- upon in some part
!to play or ping. Fencing and dancing
i add to her grace, but these may be ac
quired and used as demanded. *
And, not least of all, the voice of the
girl who aspires to become an actress
. must not only be carefully trained, but
its use must be understood. A voice
that is naturally soft, full and sym
pathetic has a charm all its own, but
much can be-accomplished by a knowl
edge of its use, and very little, even
with the sweetest voice, if there is no
knowledge used in its handling. Like
wise must there be this knowledge to
avoid an abuse- of the voice. There
-1 fore, the mere possession of a gnod
voice is not by any means all and the
chief requisite..
But granted all the necessary quali
fications and some to. spare, it is grow
ing more and more difficult for a young
woman to get upon the legitimate stage
' â almost impossible to obtain a small
part at the very befcinnir.g. The dra
| matiQ schools are frequently a great
h<lp. They teach declamation, dramat
ic deportment and many necessary
' things, and often are able to place their
i graduates in small parts in companies.
I Performances are given by the students
during the school year to which dra
matic managers are invited. To a

a dramatic company may obtain the
presenter a grain more consideration.
But such a girl should remember that
a manager has many such applications
and comparatively few parts. Sho will
probably be engaged as an "extra."
Now the hard struggle has fairly be
gun. Her next step or hope is that of
"understudy." This means that she
must be always ready to play the part
she understudies in case of the absence
or illness of the principal, usually at
short notice. When this event trans
pires her opportunity has arrived. She
must gather together her forces, subdue
all nervousness â so much easier said
than done â and acquit herself as cred
itably as she can. After the perform
ance she will not need to be told wheth
er it was good or bad. She will in
stinctively feel the effect her words and
actions have upon the audience, and
she will know if she produced the im
pression sh" desired. If she has played
her first role successfully, or even with
bare signs of promise, the. management
will sooner or later recognize it. By
recognition I mean the offer of some
small part, perhaps not as good as the
one she understudied, but at least It is
a beginning, and her name makes its
first appearance <>n the programme.
Now her failure or success depends
largelyâ very largely indeed â upon her
self.
The public seems to be interested in
the question of salary paid to a woman
on the stage. It is a subject that has
been greatly exaggerated, and one
about which it Is really difficult to
make any fixed statement. It is vari
ableâaccording to a girl's talents, the
demand she has created for her ser
vices and her business ability. The
average salary does not exceed from $50
to $75 a week. There are a great num
ber paid less than this, and many are
paid more. In first-class companies the
salaries may run from $25 to $125 a
week, exclusive of leading roles. I am
not speaking of the "extras," who have
to content themselves with $8 and $10 a
week, but of those playing the "speak
ing" parts. <)f course, with progress
the salary increases. A leading woman's
salary may range from $75 to $300, ac
cording to the management and class of
attraction In which she appears, and in
certain cases It may reach a still higher
figure.
At the first glance it seems as if the
young woman on the stfcge receives a
very liberal remuneration. She does,
but her expenses aie considerably
larger than they would be in almost
any other vocation. She will undoubt
edly have to travel much, and that
â  means constant hotel bills. In large
cities this- will probably amount to $21
a weekâ at $3 a dayâ while in smaller
towns the. hotels are usually cheaper.
Then her laundry and other petty but
necessary expenses mount up to at
least $25 a week.
Let us consider a young woman in
a first-class companyâ one who has had
several seasons' experience and who re
ceives $60 a week â a very good salary
as the average goes. Deducting her
weekly expenses of $25, she has $35 left.
But she has to make up her outlay
spent on gowns and hats at the be
ginning of the season. If her part calls
for playing a poor girl who wears
shabby clothes she probably has old
home dresses that she uses for the pur
pose, and of course this is clear gain.
But more often she requires three or
"!'â¢;â¢â¢
her bronco, was after them. The men
probably thought themselves undiscov
ered, and in the bustle of hurrying on the
stock did not hear the pattering hoofs of
the pursuer's pony as she came cantering
four smart gowns and the many acces- I
sories that accompany them. Two j
hundred and fifty dollars is a small al- j
lowance for these, particularly in New '
York, where dressmakers' and mil- |
liners' bills are ruinously high. Then
it must be remembered that the aver
age theatrical season is of only thirty
weeks' duration, so there are apt to
be twenty-two weeks of inactivity in
the year. By a little mental arithmetic
it will be seen that, although the young
woman may actually receive $1800 dur
ing a season, her running expenses
amount to just $1000, and allowing $200
for her private wardrobe, she only
saves $600. This is not saved after all
if she is entirely dependent upon her
own efforts, as It must tide her over
the summer. Then the stage dresses
may need replacing during the season.
There is much wear in the hurried fas
tening and unfastening of a gown eight
times a week, and perhaps trailing
it up and down uncarpeted stairs.
The actnss has little time for social
life. The more successful she is the
less leisure she has and the greater in
roads her work makes upon her time
and strength. It is often a genuine re
gret to have to decline much of the
delightful hospitality extended to her,
but this is a denial she must urge upon
herself, according to her own good
judgment, whether it must always be
work first and play afterward. Bhe has
no right to come to her evening's work
fagged and tired from a round of teas
and calls. She injures herself and her
art, and she is not dealing fairly with
her audience. She is up late every
night, and although I do not believe in
wasting a whole morninr in bed, she
cannot have more than sufficient sleep
if she breakfasts at 10, and if she is
wise she will take a rest before her
early di iner. She must remember that
her health and strength mean every
thing to her.
During the "run" of a play her days
are her own for study, exercise and re
creation, c cepting matinee afternoons
and an occasional rehearsal, but before
the production of a new play she is
probabl called to rehearsal at 11 and
may not leave the theater until 5 in
the afternoonâ a hard day's work, and
such will be the order of her days dur
ing the three to five weeks of prepara
tion which a play requires before pre
sentation.
When traveling she is not so much
the mistress of her time, as a great deal
of it is spent on the cars. Travel be
comes the bane of an actress' life. At
first the girl who has never been a hun
dred miles from home will enjoy the
new cities and new sights. But after
a season or two living in a couple of
trunks grows decidedly monotonous,
a?id she hails with delight the "'stand"
of a couple of weeks when she can
really shake out her skirts and settle
herself for a little sojourn. The actual
traveling is made as easy as possible
in first-class companies.
It will be, I am sure, easily seen from
the foregoing that there is no royal
road to honest and genuine success on
the stage* other than that traveled by
all who have achieved distinction in
any fieldâ hard work. And the recom
pense is the honor and fame which her
art brings her. and the satisfaction of
having accomplished something for her

"Who are you?" he responded gruffly.
"I own these cattle, and you have grit

As she held a cocked revolver at his

The women who have gone with their
! husbands or brothers to make homes
' down in the famous gold mining region of
I Tombstone, in Southern Arizona, are ac
counted among the most daring of any
in the Territories in the last ten years.
The Apache Indians, when Geronimo was
their chief, made frequent incursions into
that part of the country, and the outrages
mitted in homes of settlers and ranch
men among the mountains and foothills
are among the most atrocious and hor
rible deeds ever done by savages. With
the conquering of the Apaches some
twelve years ago by General Miles the
ye years ago by General Miles the
fearful slaughter of settlers' families and
cattle men came to an end, but the
women who still live in that region de
serve credit for frequent acts of bravery
Bmen8 men who still live in that region de
ve credit for frequent acts of bravery
and coolness in their daily life. An in
nce of this is as follows:
Mrs. Mary Nugent, her husband and
three little children came from a little
town in Pennsylvania several years ago.
They made their home seventeen miles
south of Tombstone, where they took up
one of Uncle Sam's land claims and
opened a little merchandise store for the
cowboys and Mexicans. Both husband
and wife became accustomed to seeing
Apache Indians about, and they often
gave the savages cast-off clothing.
One day in June, 1895, while Mr. Nu
gent had gone some twenty-five miles
across country to a ranch house, two
strapping strange Apaches, armed with
knives, suddenly appeared in the set
tler's home. Mrs. Nugent was there with
a 12-year-old son and a smaller daughter.
There had been reports for weeks among
the settlers that Apache Kid and his gang
of murderous thieves were marauding the
region. Mrs. Nugent was sure she had to
deal with the most cruel and most inhu
man Indians in the country. That the
men had watched her husband-rlde away
from the house she knew full well. It
would be uselss to try to deceive the red
skins.
The woman instantly decided on a
course of action. Speaking as best she
could in a jargon of English and Apache
she boldly said that her husband would be
away all day and that she was glad the
Indians had come, because she wanted
them to help her at some work. That gave
the savages a feeling that they need not
hurry about whatever sinister plans they
had in regard to the Nugent househould.
In less than half an hour tho woman,
with a smiling face and apparent deliber
ation, while her heart was beating as
never before, and her mind was in a
state of deepest alarm, had cooked a fine
breakfast for the Apaches, who sat never
uttering so much as a grunt and all the
time watching her every movement.
When the meal was over and the Indians
had received a quantity of tobacco, Mrs.
Nugent asked if they would help in mov
ing provisions into the store at the front
of the housp.
Now there was a sort of cold storage
cellar at the back of the house. It was
built of adobe bricks with a heavy wood
door with big iron hinges and a hasp for
a padlock on the outsido. It was without
windows and the walls were three feet
thick. It was a storage place for the mer
chandise sold in the little Nugent store.
Bustling about the house with forced en
ergy, but not for a moment forgetting
that the two great haif-naked savages
who stood in her doorway were there
for a settled purpose, she carried numer
ous hams and pails of lard from the store
house as if the greatest expedition were
necessary. Then, suddenly calling the
Apaches to the storehouse, she praised
their strong arms and backs and asked if
they would not carry a big barrel of lard
out of the adobe cellar to the store.
The savages were caupht off their guard
and bending low began to slowly raise the
barrel. At that very second Mrs. Nugent
snatched hold of the heavy wood door
and in a flash drew it shut, put the hasp
in place and fastened the padlock on the
outside. Then, while all manner of In
dian oaths reached her ears she brought
out the two family Winchester rifles and
stood guard over the storehouse.
She dispatched her boy with all possi
ble speed on the bare back of a bronco
to the Ailing ranch, seven miles away, for
help from the cow-punchers. Rifle in
hand she walked around and around the
exterior of the storehouse, watching 1 for
the first evidence of an attempt by the
imprisoned Apaches to dig out through the
adobe walls. Several times she fired her
rifle in order to let them know there was
some one about with firearms. In two
hours more several cowboys came to the
Nugent house and the Indians were easily
taken and were sent back to the reser
vation, where they have since been in
prison. The Indians were not In the
Apache Kid band, but years ago they
were the murderers of whites, and are
very Intractable savages. Not the least
doubt remains that they meant to kill
Mrs. Nugent and her children and rob
the store.
The women of the "Western plains are
as quick as their Eastern sisters to put
into practice modern reform Ideas. How
Whitelaw Reid, who spent several win
ters in Phoenix, has said In writing that
he has been most surprised to observe
how much more readily the new woman
of the Westâ even on the edge of the des
ertâbecomes interested In new industrial
and socialistic ideas than the woman in
the conservative Eastern States. At the
old Spanish town of San Miguel, among
the rattle ranches In Graham, a Bellamy
co-operative conking club has just com
pleted its fourth year with remarkable
success. The seventeen families on its
list include those prominent alike for
wealth and brains in the community.
Weary of the drudgery of cooking and
tired of wrestling with the long line of re
fractory hired girls, the Bellamy Club
was organized. A centrally located house
wns rented and turned over to a matron,
with a corps of assistants who were to
have full charge of preparing meals for the
club members and do nothing else. The
executive committee of three does all the
purchasing of supplies and meets every
Saturday morning to hold a consultation
and audit bills. Everything is paid for
on Monday morning, assessments being
paid a week in advance on Saturdays by
the club members. This prevents any
debts or bills from being found due at the
end of the week, and any surplus or acci
dental deficit is easily carried to the end
of the next week. The executive com
mittee is all powerful, and club members
are bound to report grievances only to it
and not to one another. The club Is run
on the family plan, and so far as pos
sible all bickering and fault-finding are
shut out. Any one who is not satisfied
can leave at any time, and the fact that
the club has lasted so long proves much
for the good sense of the members. Fam
ilies have tables by themselves if they
wish and there is a table d'hote for the
unmarried people if they wish to take ad
vantage of it. The expense has been
found to be remarkably small, the mem
bers declaring that It is less than half
what they could run a home for. The
women are sole managers; their husbands
only foot the bills.
Makiog Pearls.
AT various times attempts have been
made to manufacture genuine dia
monds and other precious stones, but
the coat of manufacture has in each
case proved so great that up to the pres
! ent time no such diamonds have been
placed on the market. This statement, of
course, does not apply to the manufacture
of artificial precious stones, which seems
to be thriving at present, judging from a
recent cable dispatch to the New York
Herald, which told how artificial diamonds
! and rubies are being manufactured in
| Europe.
The point of intersst just now is the fact
that a method of manufacturing genuine
pearls at a trifling cost has just been dis
covered. Manufacture, however, is hardly
the right word, for it is nature herself
which does almost the whole business. A
natural pearl, we know, is formed through
the intrusion nf a foreign body into the
Â»hell of a mussel.
The sea mussel is popularly supposed to
have a monopoly of this business, but this
is an error. A certain species of river mus
sels, technically known as Margaritana
margaritifera, also produces beautiful
pearut.
. The attention of a French naturalist. M.
Boutan, a professor at the Sorbonne. was
recently drawn to this fact, and he at once
conceived the idea of producing pearls by

'instruments tn the Operating Room for Receiving and Sending Dispatches by Wireless Telegraphy.
The sending of messages by the Marconi system does not require the use of the electric current in the
sen?" that the ordinary telegraph or telephone does. The signals are flashed from one station to the other
by means of Hertzian waves, as they are called. These waves, namd after Professor Hertz of Carlsruhe,
Germany, their discoverer, are magnetic waves having the same velocity as light, say 185.000 miles a
second. Professor Hertz thinks they are identical with light except that the wave-lengths themselves
are longer than the ordinary light waves. So much for the transmitting medium. Whenever an electric
spark, as from an induction coil, is made to jump back and forth between two electrodes or poles these
Hertzian waves are produced. They radiate from the producing point in all directions, and with a properly
equipped receiver at a distant point we may intercept enough of them to make them serve as a signal, to
convey intelligence, just as our own ear catches the radiation of sound waves when a voice calls from a
distance. By starting and stopping the Hertzian waves, and thus causing corresponding starts and stops
at the distant station. Marconi is able to transmit messages by the Moise telegraph code.

Vâ*/ ture of the first pun tired at Manila
was telegraphed from New York to
Chicago, St. Louis, Philadelphia and Bos
ton simultaneously over a single wire by
the Herald.
And then, after this miracle, other pic
tures were flashed back by telegraph from
those cities over the single circuit to New
York.
It was no experiment, but the practical
commencement of the Herald's new busi
ness enterprise of telegraphing pictures,
drawings, autographs and designs of all
kind;.; by wire as if but ordinary tele
graphic messages.
The machines had been tested and found
to be In perfect order when 6 o'clock, the
hour set for the lone: distance picture tele
graphing feat, had arrived.
The correspondents of the far-away
newspapers to receive the Herald's light
ning art service were on hand to observe
th" practical working of the new system.
The machines are a little larger than
one of Edison's phonographs mounted on
a cabinet stand.
F. Crane, the artist, produced the pic
tures to be sent. They were plainly
sketched on sheets of tinfoil six by eight
inches square.
The newspapers connected with the long
distance circuit were: St. Louis Republic,
Chicago Times-Herald, Philadelphia In
quirer. Boston Herald. The preliminary
adjustments of the machines had been
made.
"Click! click!" rattled a telegraph
"sounder" beside the machines. Superin
tendent Flynn, in communication with the
main telegraph office of the big downtown
Postal building, said they had made up
the circuit. That is. they had got all the
offices of the five big cities connected on
one wire running directly into the news
paper offices, east and west.
"Click, click!" went St. Louis. Then
Chicago's "â¢'lick, click!" whs followed by
Philadelphia, and Roston. The duplex
wires had neen "balanced"â the machines
harmonized, "synchronized," and Mr.

expected to do. From the wire another
medium, invisible and immaterial to the
human ?rense as it may be, takes the mes

With each electric wave from the in
strument below charging the wire there
is set up in the air about it a series of
undulations akin to those by which sound
and light are propagated through space,
and these-t moving away in concentric
waves in every direction from the wire,
carry the signals to the point desired.
There a cunningly devised and skillfully
constructed, delicate instrument will re
spond'to their imnulso and make known
their presence t<> listening ears.
First the manipulator sends out by the
Morse system of signals. South Foreland's

"ARE YOU THERE, SOUTH FORE

No answer. Repeated again and again,
each time with Increasing fearful anx
iety. Awful suspense. Seconds seem in
terminable.
"All ready," answered St. Louis and
Chicago, a thousand miles away, as Phila
delphia rind Boston tick-tacked back the
sam" message.
Correspondents and editors hovered
around the machine. A bombardment or
an electrocution could have excited no
more interest.
"We start in live seconds," click-clacked
Superintendent Flynn at the telegraph
key, with his racing watch in hand.
"One. two, three, four, fiveâ r,o!" The
"switch" was "closed." the starting but

The telegraphers' typewriting machine,

series of pinions engaging with a train of

acts upon the particular clutch that pulls
down the bar of the type corresponding
to the key touched.
Just what device is used is kept a se

electro-magnets, whose armatures are
wound with wire of different gauge in
order to secure evenness in registering by

After telegraphing by hand had been
in practice for several years it was dis

the little invisible dots on the white cyl

This principle applied In telegraphing
pictures works equally well. A drawing
is made on a sheet of tinfoil wrapped
around a cylinder In the machine similar
to the wax cylinder of a phonograph.
In Chicago there is a twin machine reg
ulated to work in perfect harmony with
the Now York machine. In Chicago, in
stead of tinfoil, a sheet nf carhon or man
ifold copying paper is placed between two
blank she, ts of paper. The New York

or platinum point above the revolving
cylinder in New York breaks the circuit
when it touches the ink outlines of the

Nothing is uncertain about the process.
Whatever is drawn on the tinfoil here is

THE visit of Princess Salm-Salm.
who arrived In New York last
Wednesday, to the United States,
as well as her unique mission, re
calls to Americans not only an in
tensely interesting personality but
a^so a chain of unusual and exciting
events connected with the lady.
Who Is the Princess P
She baa been a circus rider.
She has been a rope dancer.
She has been a soldier in three wars.
She was rÂ»-guiarly commissioned a cap
tain In the War of the Rebellion.
She was an army nurse and a spy.
Common soldiers have died in her arms,
but her hands have been kissed by kings, â 
She was the friend of President Lin
coln, the friend of the Emperor Maxi
milian of Mexico, the friend of old Kaiser
Wilhelm.
She has worn the soldiers' uniform of
throe countries.
She has been wounded twice In war.
She rode through the rebel lines in the
South on the cowcatcher of an engine.
She stopped a troop train because she
had forgotten to bring her lapdog.
She kissed President Lincoln at a public
banquet in Washington, and ever after
ward Mrs. Lincoln referred to her as
"that Mrs. Salm-Salm."
She obtained a reprieve for the Em
peror Maximilian and all but secured his
escape]
She was pensioned and publicly thanked
by the Austrian Government for her aid
to the ill-fated Maximilian.
She has Been many tragedies and many
sorrows. She has never lost her cheerful
philosophy. She is the "soldier princess,"
but she is the "laughing princess." too.
The Princess, as many old New Yorkers
will remember, is the widow of Prince
Felix Constantine Alexander John Nepo
mucene Salm-Salm of Anhalt.
While on this present visit to this, her
native country, the Princess will seize
the opportunity to restore to the Eighth
and Sixty-eighth New York volunteer
regiments six regimental battle flags
presented to the colonel. Prince Salm-
Balm, during the War of the Rebellion.
Princess Salm-Salm has many titles to
consideration besides her royal alliance.
Throughout the Civil War she served as
nurse, and devoted her pay as captain to
the relief of sick and wounded soldiers.
Her husband subsequently went to Mex
ico, where he served on the staff of Max
imilian, sharing that unfortunate mon
arch's downfall. Through his talented
wife's diplomacy the Prince's life was
spared, but her utmost efforts were un
availing to save the Emperor. Her devo
tion, however, was recognized by the Era
peror of Austria, who granted her a pen
sion. Altogether the life of this American
girl, who rose from circus performer to
Princess, is in every way remarkable.
Created Sensation in New York.
Prince Salm-Salm and his youthful bride
were the nsation here In New York for
a few seasons during the Civil War times.
Many stories were told at the time about
her obÃCure origin, unconventional career
and of the first meeting and wooing which
united the fortun"Sj>f the fair American
girl and her royal lover. The Princess
was silent when questioned about her
birth, and never refuted any stories which
came to her ears.
Love at first fight and a heart given
through the language of the eyes to a
flaxi-n-halred, blue-eyed Orman Prince
wearing thf Union blue marked the begin
ning of a life 'romance for Agnes Le
elercQ. She was an unconventional, fear
less circus rider and a born actress, flut
tering in thÂ«Â» gay circles of the capital In
the parly days of the wax. Miss Leclercq
was one of a party of visitors who went
the rounds of the camp to see the sights
one afternoon. Handsome and gallant
Prince Salm-Salm 6erved on the staff of
his fellow countryman. General Luis Blen
ker. The army lay In front of Washington
that afternoon, and the Prince was among
the notables Introduced to the independent
little American girl. Though he was
handicapped by his slight knowledge of
English, he found the language of the eyes
more expressive than tongue.
A brief camp courtship led to the altar,
and Miss Leclercq, the sprightly rider,
was made the Princess Salm-Salm. Such
a marriage would not necessarily Involve
a remarkable career, but when a soldier
ts a Prince of stoical stock there are pos
sibilities in the situation. And the Prln
cess Salm-Salm made the most of each.
The Prince lacked the diplomacy neces
sary to make headway In the circles of
capital intriguers. Fortunately for him
his wife was of an entirely different char
acter. She had been educated under the
guidance of a Cabinet official, was thor
y schooled in the secrets of official
life and she recognized the possibilities of
her power, shielded by her husband's title.
Proud of Her Diplomacy.
Princess Salm-Salm was proud of her
â¢ Mplomacy and always said that she saved
the Prince from threatened dismissal from
the army. General Blenker was relieved
i f his command after the battle of Cross
Keys, in 1882, owing to a disagreement
with General Fremont, his superior ofli
cer. The removal of the general left the '
members of his military family without
I itlon. and an order was issued to
muster them out. according to the rules
of the army. This was not a dismissal,
and all of them re-entered the service.
Prince Salm-Salm was chief of staff to
General Blenker and held the rank of
colonel.. Through the efforts of his wife
he retained that rank and was assigned to
the colonelcy of the Eighth New York.
General Blenker's original command.
Blanker s staff officers were deeply in
ted in ilt> love romance of their royal
ule. whom they familiarly spoke of
as "Salm," pronouncing the word as
though it were spelled "Sam." When the
li vers first met the German division was
encamped at Hunter's Chapel. Virginia,
about seven miles jouth of Washlni
li was true, fit" the Princess said, that
Colonel Salm-Salm could not speak Eng
lish. Whenever General Blenker and his
staff rode about the ramp or to the city
of Washington on occasions of ceremony
the Princess, who was a brilliant horse
woman, galloped at the head of the cav
alcade by the side of the Prince and the
general. The peculiar beauty of the Prin
cess, hÂ°r warm Southern complexion and
vivacious temperament gave currency to
the rumor that she was a daughter of
Mexico. She was always spokf-n of in
ramp in Washington, as well as in New
fork society, as Prince Salm-Salm's Mex
ican wife, but at that nnv "Mexican" was
a term quite synonymous, with Spanish.
The Princess was American born, but had
lived for some years In Havana.

Now Vlsitlna This Country.
SERVED UNDER THREE FLAGS AND EARNED THE GERMAN IRON CROSS
gan In the summer of 1P62. after he had
borne himself gallantly at the battle of
Cross Keys and lasted fully a year. When
j the order for muster out, or so-called dls
| missal, was hanging ovei his head, liable
to strike his name from the army roll at
any moment, his wife hurried from the
front to Washington, bent upon securing
his appointment to a permanent com
mand. The Princess made a personal ap
peal to Senator Ira Harris of New York.
He declared the case hopeless.
Successful Intervention.
"Governor Morgan," he said, "is a
stern woman-hater. Your blandishments.
smiles and entreaties vrill be wasted upon
him: you had better not take the trouble."
But the courageous wife hastened to the
executive chamber at Albany. She an
nounced her intention of sitting down and
waiting until the Governor found a Ger
man regiment without a commander and
â ..I delivered into her hands In
a command for Prince Salm-Salm
as colonel of that regiment.
Her tactics prevailed. A few hours later
she had the desired commission and
Pnncr Salm-Salm resigned honorably, to
muster in again as colonel of the Eighth.
Th" regiment was one of the few enlisted
for two years, and In 1Â«63 was discharged
from service. The Prince was again with
out any emmand. The colonelcy of the
Sixty-eighth, another German regiment
was offered to him. But the ranks were
short of several hundred men. Prince
Salm-Salm was offered the position If he
could recruit men enough to complete th->
zatlon. Several of his plans failed.
But he did not give up. He had a wife
Ingenious and contriving, and he appealed
to her.
She found in Washington a couple of
hundred unasslgned recruits. After a long
battle of diplomatic dexterity she secured
them. One hundred of these belonged to
Illinois, and the Governor of that State,
"Dick" fates, said he was willing to let
his men go to a New York regiment pro
vided it was fed by a man who was not a
New York â bumpkin." as he pleased to
i term it. The Princess assured him that
! that would not happen even if she had to
me charge of the troops herself. The
j idea struck his fancy, and Governor
Yates acted upon the hint. He appointed
tier captain on a regular salary, and the
painted on, are paper monstrosities fas
tened to the canvas.
Besides the fake on Mr. Yolk's painting.
the same hand has a burlesque on one of
the portraits exhibited by Miss Adelaide
Coleman Chase, a blue ribbon is con

shows a curiously distorted female head
and is #ntitled "The Blue Ribbon, by A.
Cold Chase." Miss Lucia Fairchild Ful
ler's "Girl with a Hand Glass" has also
come in for a fake. It Is very clever and
shows a tall, white robed woman with a
razor in one hand and a looking-glass in
the other. A large canvas by Albert Her
ter of a man kissing a young woman has
also been burlesqued under such titles
hs "He Hurt Her," and, referring to the
dim light of the picture. "A Bite at Twi

In New York Society.
During the winter uf 1563-64 the Prince
and his consort became most conspicuous
in New York Bocial life. They gTaced all
military functions. No ball, reception or
sword presentation was a success without
their company. He was the lion and she
the belle of the hour. One of their diver
sions was spiritual seances, which attract
ed wide attention at that time. A medium
celebrated among the non-prof essional
communicants with the spiritual world
embraced in her circle the Princpss Salm-
Salm. The manifestations were purely a
matter of scientific study. Before the
winter ended the Prince was ordered West
with his command and the Princess was
lost to New York society from that time.
However, the good wishes of a host of
friends followed her during all her fateful
wanderings. In the West she joined the
corps of army nurses and gave the suffer
ing boys in blue the benefit of her skill
in diplomacy. If there were any supplies
to lit- had the irrepressible nurse cut red
tape and secured them, law or no law.
''I-,.- day she broke down the rules of
discipline fixed by the Prince himself.
Sitting in his tent while he was absent,
she heard sounds of distress Issuing from
tin- guardhouse near by. She soon traced
the cries to a soldier who had been
tapved with a bayonet in his mouth. His
Offense was his refusal to obey an order
of Colonel Salm-Salm. then in command
of the brigade. The Prim-els demanded
from the adjutant general that the man
be released, but the official, of course,
said that the colonel's order alone could
be obeyed. He had fixed the nature and
exhibited. The Fakers announce that this
year they will present the winner of the
Shaw prize with an "unkissed portrait of
Hobson." To the Shaw prize Miss Zella
Milhau adds a consolation prize of $5 03
and a mince pie for the least meritorious
fake. The winner of the prize Is obliged
to eat the pie and the money is for doctor
fees.
One of the funny features of each year's
Fakers' show is the catalogue. Its feat
ures are highly miscellaneous. The cata
logue of the show which opens to-mor
row contains, of course, a burlesque on
that of the Society of American Artists.
It begins with the "Can't-Be-Built Gal
lery" (Vanderbilt Gallery). A few quo
tations from the list will illustrate Its
playful spirit: "Bogus, George H.â 345,

familiar with the exhibition of the Society

the names of the painters and the pic

logue.
There is Just one serious note In the
symphony of fun in which the Fakers in

was suffering cruelly, and the Princess
severed the cords which bound him, fed
i him from the colonel's mess and sent him

! of the incident until after the war was
; over, for the adjutant was afraid to re

so grateful to the Princess that he
promptly obeyed the obnoxious order, and

Adventures In Mexico.
Before coming to America the Prince
had been a soldier In his native apuntry
Prussiaâ also In the army of Austria.
' The enterprise of the Austrian Prince,
Maximilian, in Mexico was at it? height
when the war in the United States end< 'i.
and Salm-Salm offered his sword to the
imperial cause. His Bervices were ac
l cepted, and he was appointed on the staff
uf the Emperor. The Princess joined him
in the City of Mexico, ready to sharp the
trials and advent tires of her husband and
the hapless Emperor to the end.
Mexico, in the sixties, as the world
knows, was literally "gone to the dogs."
It represented among me nations noth
ing but hopeless d( j bts. broken pledges
and a long, black list of unaveng. d op
pressions, persecutions and cruelties.
Every State in the realm was torn by
Moody revolution. There was no chief,
no order, no justice. The people ruled
themselves. An army s.jiit by Napoleon
to protect French subjects had scattered
the Mexican Boldlery. Juarez, the latest
dictator, was a fugitive: Marshal Bazaine

RARE BOOKS WORTH
THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD
Some of the First. Volumes Printed in England and Tr;is Country
Are Now Worth Thousands of Dollars.
THE first printing press was brought
into England by a merchant named
Caxton. who forsook his trade to
enjoy the favor of the Duchess of
Burgundy, sister of Edward IV of
England, and in 1476 Imported from
Germany a printing outfit, which he es
tablished in a building adjoining West
minster Abbey, especially for the purpose
of publishing his translation of the His
tory of Troy (Recueil dcs Histoires de
Troyes). It was the first English book
ever printed, and in 1886 a copy was sold
by the Earl of Jersey to Bernard Quar
itch, In London, for $9100.
The next book printed in England was
"The Game and Playe of Ye Chesse."
Copies have been sold as high as $1300.
The first English book both written and

his troops. But before this important act ! ,
took place Bazaine had misled Maximilian "
Into a step which sealed his doom. The (
French Marshal represented that his ,
arms had dispersed the champions of re- \
publlcanism; that Juarez, the head of the ,
liberal cause, was a fugitive beyond the ,
border, and that only outlaws and rob- :
bers were in arms against the empire.
Bazaine demanded an enactment declar
ing all rebels outlaws and acted up to its ,
provisions before it became a law. The
Emperor opposed it, and after four vic
tims had been shot virtually rescinded it.
When the French withdrew Maximilian
informed Juarez,- chief claimant to the |
disputed Presidency, that he would aban- j i
don the empire if Juarez would promise .
amnesty to the imperialist leaders in
Mexico. Juarez refused. Maximilian de- .
cided to remain and protect his adher- i
ents. A strong conservative party, repre- i
senting the church, urged him to stay.
He put himself at the head of the army !
and centered all his energy to carry on
the war. Carlotta, his spouse, went to
j Eurdpe to plead with the powers, with
| Napoleon and with the Pope, and to se- I
sure her own vast private fortune to sup
port her husband's cause. The French
j had alienated the people. The volunteers

Juarez, who permitted promiscuous
plunder of the people. A few foreign resi
dents that chose to remain were all that
Maximilian could count upon. Bribes and
threats impaired the fidelity of the na
tives. â¢
Maximilian's End.
The end came with awful suddenness.
Kazaine, on withdrawing, gave the mon
archy a stab by sounding vivas for
Juarez. Maximilian abandoned the capital
and brought up at Queretaro. where, with
six thousand against thirty thousand, he
stood siege for weeks, his men living on
horse flesh. He led sorties in person; he
I rode where shots were thickest; he de
i clined to use bribes to protect himself.

plans to force his way through the en
emy's lines. But one night his favorite
staff officer, Lopez, a second Iscariot, who
often . embraced the Emperor i!i publicâ
a man Carlotta had so honored and trust
ed as to make him colonel of the "Em
press Regiment," which she recruited and
equipped with her own private funds â
betrayed the camp to the Mexicans for a
price, and Maximilian was overpowered,
lighting desperately.
Soon after he reached Maximilian's
camp Salm-Salm volunteered on a scout
ing trip to the interior. Hia wife also
volunteered, and appealed to the com
mandant of the detachment, a gallant
Belgian colonel. He agreed to take her
along, providing she could keep cool,
carry a revolver and not use it until the
troops camo to close quarters. To this
severe test of coolness sue proved equal,
and rode at the front with the leaders
as ready and self-possessed in the tire of
battle as she had been in the councils of
diplomacy.
When Maximilian personally abandoned
the City of Mexico and retired to the in
terior town of (jueretaro, the Princess
was left behind with the German garri
son. This separation from Maximilian's
suite led to several startling and dra
matic adventures, which displayed both
physical courage and diplomatic nerve. It
was plain to every one that the Emperor
was lost after the desertion of his French
allies, but the Princess, fearing that her
husband might have to share the fate of
Maximilian, set about the most desperate
plan to ward off the impending peril.
Queretaro and the City of Mexico wera
both besieged -by overwhelming numbers
of Mexicans. She first proposed to tho
Mexican commander that the German
garrison in the City of Mexico should
surrender without fighting and Maximil
ian be. in consequence, allowed to go free.
In passing back and forth through the
lines, bent on this errand, the Princess
several times exposeu her life to danger.
Once she was detained in the city until
after dark, and on approaching the senti
nel of the besiegers she answered the
challenge. "Who goes there?" with the
word "enemigo" (enemy), inadvertently
spoken for "amigo" (friend). The senti
nel fired, but missed his mark.
After the verdict of death had been pro
nounced the Princess was permitted to
see Maximilian and her husband in
prison, and she at once began to plot for
their rescue. A bribe was arranged, but
there was no cash to meet the demand.
Incited by her tireless exhortations Maxi
milian gave two one hundred thousand
dollar notes upon the imperial house of
Austria. Had there been $1000 in cash the
plan might have been carried through.
As it was, the notes were too dangerous
as evidence. Salm-Salm and the Empe
ror were hopeless of escape, but the keen
witted woman, who was for a time free
to approach officers and guards, knew
that gold, and gold only, would open the
Mexican prison bars. In the end Esco
bedo suspected her Intrigue, and sent her
away under guard to Juarez, the Presi
dent, whose party had fought against
Maximilian's reign.
Saved Her Husband's Life.
Juarez was so impressed by the brave
little American woman that he promised
to spare her husband in any event, and
he granted to Maximilian a respite of
two weeks for the hearing of counsel in
his behalf. The Princess collected and
disbursed funds for the incidental ex
penses of the trial, and waa recognized
by all as the factotum of the doomed
man. Although the foreign representa
tives in Mexico could demand admission
to the Emperor and exert great influence
if so disposed, they were panic stricken
and afraid to raise a finger. The Empe
ror said to the Princess, when Eaeobedo
finally ordered her to leave the country:
"You are the only person who has really
done anything for me. If you go I am
utterly forsaken." But she had no gold,
and could get no gold, and the drama
ended in the execution of Maximilian.
Juarez kept his promise and spared Salm-
Salm. He returned to Prussia and re
entered the army as major in the Grena
dier Guards.
The Princess Salm-Salm entered a Ger
man hospital to study nursing for field
service. From April to June, 1870, she ap
plied herself assiduously from 8 o'clock in
the morning until 6 at night, and at the
end of that time the surgeon in attend
ance gave her a certificate as proof of
her ability. The surgeon was appointed
to the Eighth Rhenish Army Corps, and
he promised to take her along, so that
she might be near her husband. But that
a woman should go into the field as nurse
was something unheard of in the Prus
sian army.
She met opposition on all sides. After
an interview with General yon Steinmetz,
then commander of the First Army Corps,
carried on in broken German, he sent for
the quartermaster and placed her request
before him, asking if it could be # granted.
"It can, if your Excellency *so com
mands," was the reply. General yon
Steinmetz at once drew out the desired
permission, and she got ready to join tha \
hospital wagon. But Salm-Salm would-^
not hear of that, and she had to satisfy
herself with doing camp work. She waa
much depressed at this, because she had
a presentiment that her husband would
meet his death during the war. At the
battle of Weissenburg the Princess waa
on the field as chief of a corps of army
nurses. The report came that her hus
band was wounded. She hastened to him,
but arrived too late to see him alive. He
died within three hours after the bullet
struck him. The Princess continued in
the service until the war ended, and waa
decorated by the German Kaiser with
rd< r of the Iron Cross. This heroine
of three wars was thenâ lÃ7lâ but 23 years
old.
The Princess now shows but few effects
of her trying and adventurous life. She
stUl looks remarkably young, is slender,
of medium height and with hair more
auburn than gray. She will visit many
old friends during her stay in America.
Lemon Bath as a Refresher
At a recent reception of the Pro
fessional Woman's League a well-known
actress was telling some, of her asso
ciates in the profession the luxury of a
lemon bath which she tried while on a
recent trip to the West Indies. She said
that it imparted a sense of cleanliness
and freshness to the skin that made a
Turkish bath look like thirty cents. sev
eral lemons or limes are sliced and al
lowed to soak in the bath water for an
hour until all the juice is extracted. A
handful of bran or two, and the prepa
rations for an unsurpassable refresher
are complete.
"Give me liberty," howled the Filipino,
as he brandished his bow and arrow, "or
give me death."
"Acting under instructions from my
Government," replied the American troop
er, turning the crank of his Gatliug, "I
will endeavor to give you both."How Our Sick Soldiers Are Created in Manila

CATCHING
PICKPOCKETS
MANY stories are told as to how r
pickpockets come to grief at^
times, with all their cleverness,*
but the following story, thel
writer believes, is new. J
A gentleman going through a leading:
street in Liverpool stopped to look at*
some pictures displayed in one of the shop/?
windows. He Mad not stood there many!
seconds before he became aware of the'
, lose proximity of one of the nimble-7
fingered gentry. The gentleman watched*
him for a little while, then took out his â â¢
purse and looked Into it, as though count-4
ing if he had sufficient to make a pur-,;
chase, then put the purse in the inside^
pocket of his overcoat, making much arto $
as though pushing it into a corner; on?
which he turned to look through the win-*
dow again, seemingly loth to give up the<s
bargain. The light-fingered one slipped!
up behind him, and. before you could say]
"Jack Robinson," had his hand in the ca- f
pacious pocket. The gentleman buttoned*
up >iis coat and proceeded on his way,^
but had not gone very far before a man 4
called to him: <t
"Hi! there's a man with his hand in^
your pocket."
"Never mind him," said the gentleman. *'
This occurred several times, and in each^
case he gave the same reply. 4
Presently they came to a police sta-i
tion. The gentleman entered, made hlsT
statement, and then asked one of thef
officers to help to take his overcoat off.l
as the man could not otherwise get hisj
hand loose. For, besideÃ a quantity of*?
fishhooks, there was a mediuni-sized'rat-i
trap in his pocket, into which he had in-I
serted a hook when the man thought ho"
was hiding his purse, and into which the*
would-bo pickpocket had thrust his !
hand, drawing down the spring, and thus,
making himself prisoner. }

had all derm linen and his hair combed
and he crossed his hands and lay there
for the u< xt two .lays, fairly beaming anil
reveling in his cleanliness.
"For weeks the hospital for the sick
was all we had to look after. Then
troubU came. We had been listening to
every signal for days, expecting the call
to arms, [t caxne about 9:30 o'clock at
night on February 4. Only part of the
boys went out at first. We listened to the
firing, which was bo near that stray bul

SPEAKER REED
AND
JUDGE WALLACE
Justice Field's first fee reminds the->
writer of a story told by Speaker Reed
who, when a young man, also resided in*
California. It was at a dinner given atT
the Bhoreham Hotel by Mr. Richard O.f
Kerens of St. Louis. The writer was in--.
troduced to Mr. Reed, and learning that 1^
was associated with the California press, '
asked: "Is old Judge Wallace alive yet?"*
and then related the following good story â¦
of how he was admitted to the bar. It*
is an old story, but in this connection will*
bear repetition: X
"I was a school teacher when I con- f
eluded to study law. After months of i
hard study I appeared fearfully before^
Judge Wallace for my examination.*
Without any preliminaries whatever, or a<Â£
single word by way of preface, he in- 4
quired suddenly: 'Young man. Is the legal*
tender act constitutional? 1 I promptly^
replied: 'Yes. sir.' j
" 'Then you're admitted to the bar,'4>
said he. 'A young man who was here justf
before you (the Sheriff of Tuolumne Coun-<4,
ty) said that it was not. I admitted himi
also. Always glad to admit young men^
to the bar who can answer great constitu-f
tional questions off-hand.' " 4
When the laugh had subsided Mr. Reed't'
continued: "How well I remember the +
first fee I received. Twenty-five dollars*
in coin; and how proud I was as I jin-^
gled it in my pocket. I received it for a

of tlie boys came to the hospital to see

village of the Filipinos near us. They had
been very friendly, but all around the
natives were joining the insurgents, and
we did not know how soon the near-by
village would go too. There was. a guard
placed below us, and we kept our tars
open for the signal which would tell us to
get the men up to the top of the hill and
out of the way of the Filipinos. But the

Special to the Sunday Call.
IN the twenty-seven years I've been ship building on the Delaware the
firei steel l warship, the first iron sailing ship and the first steel steam-
Khip in the I nlteri States have been built in our yards, and the first
compound marine engine ever erected in this country was also con
structed here. It seems hard to realize that such a thing as a steel
ship was unknown a quarter of a century ago; whereas wooden ships
plated with iron were attempted as long ago as lfÂ»Bft by the Dutch
â¢when they built the Finis Belli in the River Scheldt, hoping to annihilate
the Spaniards.
The Dolphin, the first steel warship the United States ever owned, was
elpn the flra: steel propeller built In this country. Yet the Dolphinâ now in
admirable although she made a single voyage of 53,000 miles, the
longest on record without an hour's delay for repairs of any kind, was not
even authorized by Congress until March 18. 1883, but little over sixteen
years ago. Ji Ib owing io our mastery of steel working in the past twenty
years that tho steel ship is now the accepted type of all marine archi
tecture.
The practical dlffereices between the iron plates in use on ships for
many years previous, and the steel plates now universally adopted, are so
vital al to be underatcod even by a non-expert. Yet there are doubtless
few, pave those who have made the subject a special study since boyhood,
with abundant opportunities of working out practical problems, who
realize the romance in the history of the metal ship. There is no more
pplendid example of man's triumph over the forces of nature. The Idea
of an iron ship, a structufe requiring the greatest buoyancy, made out of
metal of the greatest gravity, would have been considered by the ancients
c contradiction in terms. Yet they were fine worker* in metals and Yeiy
Euccessful ship builders after their own Ideas.'" - â¢ \>>- =** â '-***,

his friendsâ not honor, perhaps. *
lie sat for a while eying, young Thornton with a somher side glance.
The boy moved a little stealthily an<l slipped his hand into his breast,
drawing something forth which he held tightly clasped. Armstrong leaned
over and peered at it, then he broke into a harsh laugh.
"Tush, the boy is less green than we thought. Here he sits sighing
over his lady's picture, doubtingâ and right wisely. I swearâ if she will
have a smile left for him now house and helrship are gone. Grant ua a
eight thereof, captain; we are all lovers of beauty here. Show us. your
prettyâ" v
He stopped abruptly. Thornton leaped up and stood facing his tor
mentor, his eyes, In their reddened rims, blazing from his desperate young
face.
"Curse you:" he cried, in a high, broken voice; "it isâ it is my mother."
The miniature dropped from his hsnd, and he. his last shred of control
rent away, flung himseJf on one of the rude pallets by the wall and lay
there shaken by gasping sobs. . * " .
The" soldiers drew apart a little, murmuring and casting curious glances
at- Armstrong. The sneer was still about his lips as he picked up the
miniature: his face grew somewhat set as he stared at It. but his color
changed slightly. Tt was a grave, high, sweet countenance which looked
out. a little proudly, from the narrow frame; a face deepened and made
more delicate by the years which had faintly silvered the hair. After that
long look Armstrong shut his hand over the picture, clenching it hard,
then walked over to where Thornton lay, and stirred him with the point
of his boot. .
"Take it," he said briefly. Then, as the other, too broken for anger,
reached out for it obediently, he added: "She Is no Puritan, I'll be bound;
she is a loyal lady?" â¢
Thornton nodded mutely.
*]Dld she strive to hold "you from the war?"
She bade me go, as my father would have gone, fastened my eword
and blessed me."
â¢ He had begun his answer dully, but at the end his voice shrilled off
Into a miserable laugh. ,
Armstrong laughed, too. The wine'had worked with him. sober though
he seemed, and he presently began to talk to no one in particular.
See now the freaks of that jade Fortuna! I. who am assuredly not
Puritan nor precisian, must needs have a mother which was both, s'life!
yes, and could well have borr.e. for all that, to have her yet. But I was
aye loyal to King and court, and followed his Majesty onceâ or ever open

their-enrths: So the five memberffcven) soot free, and mistress my mother
nearo.T was of that untrodly crew of soldiers and bade me repent orâ.
But T was ever a profane wietch among her ministers: an' I let slip a
damme.' T was excommunicate, and I could never learn the Puritan trick
of reserving all damnation for other folks. So there T was outcast and
cursed for a son of perdition err yet T dpser.ved it, perchance, as well as
now. Faith. I've done my best since then â a son should not g've his
mother thÂ«Â» lie. Yen. casi out and landless. But T nm not landless now."
he ended, with a sudden change of voice. "Nay. mother or none, your very
inglenook Is mlno. Thorntonâ unit's* I fall to-morrow, when you shall be
mine heir, for other have T none."
Thornton sat up suddenly, a cruel light of hope flashing across his
face. Armstrong s.-iw it and smiled.
"Take my word fort, my son." lie s.iid. with the air of one bestowing
r benediction, "thou nrt assuredly a very fool."
Sharp across his words came" an outburst of confused and clnmorous
sour* from without. Armstrong strnfisrKtenpa himself and listened intently.
"To your weapons!" he cried. "Gad! T thought we had an hour vet ere
it was i'mÂ« to fâ¢t to our nrtts. A? I liveâ ay. 'tis from that ouarter it

as any among the manifold deaths which environed him. and which, de

passion.

spaces of tranouil light. But the dawn served Thornton only to see how

watched him ride into the midst af b knot of fugitives with paÂ»monate

"Take my horse, your highness " cried Armstrong, springing down to
make his meaning dear, for h's words were overnolsed.
Prince Rupert vaulted to the saddle; yet, intent on his work though he

earthworks and was fighting hard against desperate odds. He wore the

Armstrong hesitated, his hand gripping the pike. The boy's Insolent
madness had set him free to strive toward the hope which made a beacon
before him. Then another thought leaped to his mind; his face flushed
darkly. /
"Sheâ oh. damnation!" he muttered, and made a long stride forward
pike in hand.
The fight was brief, for Armstrong came fresh to thp work and the
parliamentarians knew that their fellows had all retreated. The lleuten

When the Dutch conceived the idea of building a floating- wooden fort
ress arÂ»d then plating it over with iron, they made a brilliant but unsuc
cessful start in the right direction. The Finis Belli had no steam to move
her, and became unmanagable. By and by there was a steam parship
built, the Fulton, or Demologos. in 1814, but she had no iron plates and
her deck was sheathed with nothing more formidable than heavy scant
ling. Yet the idea of sheathing was still in evidence. When Ericsson in
vented the propeller in 1537, it was inevitable that there would be a screw
warship, and the Princeton was launched in 1839.- Then in 1842 John Ste
vens built his floating fort, sheathed it with iron, and put heavy guns
aboard, going back to the idea of the Dutch, but nothing practical came
of it.
The Civil War naturally stimulated ship building to renewed activity
John Roach, my father, had already one of the best equipped foundries
and engine works in the country. I can speak from my own knowledge
for I had served my appreticeship under him in the Aetna Iron Works and
later In the Morgan Iron Works, and as a boy, even, had carried his din
ner basket to him when he was a workman in the old Allaire Works in
New York, all of which he afterward owned. When he purchased what has
Bince been Roach's Shipyard, at Chester, Pa,, in 1871, I took an executive
position there, and since his death, in 1887, have had charge of the works
In the sixties, in this yard, there had been built for the United States
Government the monitors Lehigh, Sangamon and Jason, at least one of
which was again made ready for harbor defense last summer when it
was feared that Cervera's mysterious fleet was about to attack our coast
It Is of more value in the evolution of the modern steel ship that the Wat
eree, the first Iron gunboat, had been built in this yard in 1863 While this
was going on along the Delaware my father had built engines in New

muttered in his ear. "(Jet me forth of thisâ the hedge yonderâ"
looking up he saw Armstrong's face, changed and rigid, with no ex
pression in It save a blank endurance. His heart sank with an awe in
which was mingled something of physical fear and recoil. He put out a

The. engagement in Hampton Roads between Ericsson's Monitor and the
Merrimac had not only drawn the attention of France and other foreicn
Governments to the improvements made in iron warships in the United
States but resulted also in our Government ordering the construction of
the iron Canonicus and Mahopac and the other "ninety-day boat" " Tt
was now evident that the ironclad was the warship of the future I^ance
indeed, in 1854, had built the monitor Devastation and the Glolre in IV*
while Great Britain had in 1869 authorized the building of the ironclad
Warrior. But nobody knew what an ironclad was good for until Ericsson's
Monitor demonstrated it. The razeed .wooden stefmships which the Con
federates protected with railroad iron and chains on the Southern rive?s
gave American genius another strong, hint. But when the war came to an
end but little more had been accomplished. The moni tori thenTuilding
were gradually finished and no. new ironclads were ordered until 1574

of ono piece, like an image of stone. It seemed to take them an endles3
time to reach that hedge, not half a score paces away. Thornton's mind
WM in a turmoil of subsiding anger, relief, distress, gratitude. Clear to
him above all else was the pressure of that heavy twitching hand on hla
shoulder.
They reached the hedge at last, and Armstrong, releasing the other,
stood erect an instant, swayed and dropped. The hedge, shaken by his
fall, sent down a little perfumed shower of dew and flower petals. Thorn
ton kneeled down, unclasped the wounded man's corselet, not without in
finite pain, and made an unavailing effort to staunch the wound. Then
he waited, mute and helpless. The life ebbed visibly, breath by breath,
from thu solili-r's face, which was settling into lines of absolute, remote
stillness. Would he pa+s without a word?
Suddenly Armstrong groaned and opened his eyes. His face writhed
with a quick spasm, hut he made a prim effort to smile, and then to speak.
Thornton "waited with shrinking: eagerness. Death was so strange to
him; he wa? filled with a wonder and passionate reverence which was
deeper even than his gratitude. What words should come from one who
seemed already to have crossed the narrow, immeasurable rift and to
speak from the other side?
"Was ever such accursed luck!" said Armstrong feebly. " 'Tls, I swear,
but the second. time I have served any save myselfâ and to be slain fort!"
The words broke so oddly across his awestruck silence that Thornton
was seized with a strangling desire to laugh;he choked it back, almost
bringing tears by the effort.
"But you will not die!" he exclaimed, scarce knowing what he said.
"My side is nigh cut through." answered Armstrong hoarsely.
"Alas!" faltered the boy, "there is so much I should sayâ to thank
youâ"
"For dying?" muttered the other. " "Tis not to pleasure you. my son."
"Let me but seek a ehlrurgeon for you." exclaimed Thornton hope
lessly; it eased him a little to make even such an Impossible offer.
"Or a divine?" scoffed Armstrong. "I will c'en die as I have lived. And
I have my 'doctors'* hereâ or so my good comrades say of me." With an
nttempt at laughter he pulled out the dice he had used so lately; they
dropped from his fingers to the ground.
Thornton drew back. The man had saved him, and he was dying for
King and Cause, and yet
" 'TiÃ pity, too," said Armstrong, half to himself, "after to-day, and
the Prince had noted me. God! it's all a throw of the dice. But we have
the- town?" Â»â¢
The other could make no answer; the distant blare of victory was less
to him at the moment than the last throb of that defeated life.
Into Armstrong's face was coming again the look of a great with
drawal, but he roused himself, to meet Thornton's eyes.
"Your lands areâ yours," he said.
The boy's face crimsoned, then paled. His hope, lik* his resentment,
had been quenched in that dread on-coming presence of death; they
flashed up at the word, to sink again.
"But I would not have it soâ at this cost," hÂ« cried, and, for tha la-
stant, spoke true.
With a sudden movement Armstrong stretched out his hand.
Show me â "
The wish was never spoken. His body straightened sharply 'or the
last breast-to-breast grapple with deathâ a wordless, breathless, unending
momentâ then it shuddered, slackened. His hand fell back heavily upon
the reddened dice.

of a warship of steel-a metal then so little known in practical workingâ
was a tisk that might well tempt the most ardent ambition. But already
in December ISS2. we had taken a contract, fraught with. almost equal
possibilities for" the construction of the first metal sailing ship built in the
TJnlted States and one of the very first in the world. This was the Tillie
E. Starbuck a full-rigged iron ship, launched April 4. 1883.
The Starbuck went into commission June 12, 1883, and she is to-day
trading around the world, one of the most picturesque and profitable ves
sels of her class in existence, sailing from New York to San Francisco
and from San Francisco to Calcutta as readily as though steam had never
been discovered. She was built for William H. Starbuck of New York
and named by him/after his wife. Miss Tillie E. Irving, a Chester girl.
This vessel was of 2038 tons, cost- 1150,000. which was considered a great
deal of money to put into a sailing ship, was 273 feet long, 42.3 feet beam,
26 3 feet depth of hold and 175 feet from her main truck to the water. She
was the first sailing vessel in the world to carry metal masts, hers being
of three-eighths inch iron plates. But the Starbuck's superiority to many
tramp steamers did not depend entirely on her speed.
The Starbuck was an iron ship. The first steel sidewheel merchant
steamer in the United States was the Alaskan, launched in the Roach
yards in ISB3 for the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company,BIGGEST GANS OF COUNTERFEITERS
IN THE COUNTY CAUGHT.
THH boldest, most skillful and most
extensive counterfeiters this coun
try has ever known were landed
safely in jail three weeks ago in
Lancaster, Pa. They had been
conducting their operations for
nearly Jive years, during which time they
had defrauded the Government of nearly
half a million dollars and were rapidly
getl: . improved nchinery fn shape to
defr it out of millions annually So
dtmcult of detection was the product ot
their skill that it dtated the recall
by the Secretary of the Treasury of an
issue of $26,000.0)0.
For more than a ar the shrewdest de
tectives of the Secret Service Department
have been at work on the case, no less
than 100 m<-n, women and children hav
ing been employed on it at one time or
another. Months ago sufficient evidence
was secured to warrant the arrest of
pome of the guilty parties. But the
United States Government does not mind
being slow if it is sure, and it laboriously
wound its coils closer and closer about
the gang until it was ready to strike. The
result has been the greatest coup ever
known in the annals of the secret ser
vice.
The most surprising thing in connection
with this remarkable case is the at
tempts at bribery that are shown to have
been made by the counterfeiters not only
to insure their own personal safely, but
to Introduce their false currency even
into the United States Treasury in Wash
ington. The secret service men have dis
covered that even the treasury itself had
been invaded by the agents of the coun
terfeiters. A fortune was offered a very
prominent treasury official if he would
take $10,000,000 worth of the spurious paper
and give in return the equivalent of
genuine money. He was then to give out
the worthless notes as genuine, and so
manage that the Government itself would
be circulating the bad money for the
counterfeiters. Had this bold attempt at
bribery been successful the Government
would have lost millions of dollars and at
the same time established a reputation
that would have not beeÂ» overcome in
many years.
The counterfeiters' agents also made at
tempts to bribe secret service officials in
order to get their men into the ser.vice so
as to keep tab on the movements of that
ofliee.
In one case the attempt at bribery was
successful. Ex-United States District At
torney Xewltt waa the man who fell. He
accepted large sums of money and In re

As the rape evelops evidences of brib
ery become more imerous. It has been
clearly shown that the fang had in mind
one of the mort corrupting plans that was
ever evolved. They intended to stop at
nothing. Every influential official who
cnuld be bribed was to â â¢â¢ approached.
Almost incredible sums were offered, and
the gang was fully able to offer them, see
ing that if tht-ir pcheme had been suc
cessful they would soon have in circula
tion more money than the United States
Government. The worst of the ca.*o is
that the plan in contemplation was to
tlood the country with new Issues of
paper before the people were fully ac
quainted with the genuine, and in this
manner the counterfeit would put Itself
on a plane of equality with the real.
Attention was first called to the opera
tions of the gang in January. 1838. George
Cranvr of the sub-treasury in Philadel
phia then submitted to the officials of the
Treasury Department in Washington Bye
"Monroe head" silver certificates of the
value of $100 each, stating that he was
sure they were counterfeited, but desired
the judgment of his superiors at head
quarters on the question. The bills had
come to him in the ordinary course of
business, three having been accepted
without suspicion at the Custom-house
and two having been turned in by banks.
Th<> coior of the seal of the sue
bills was salmon-pink instant of carmine,
as it should h;uo been, and the paper
seemed thicker than the genuine.
Consternation reigned h the Treasury
Department wh>-n the spuriousnesa
certificates was demonstrated. There
were 200.000 of the genuine hiils in circu
lation, and how many of these marvel
ous imitations were out no one could sur
mise. The Government was in a way to
lose an enormous sum, which would con
tinue to grow greater until the makers
of these counterfeits should be discov
ered and their nefarious operations
stopped. The matter fell within the
scope of Assistant Secretary of the Treas
ury Vanderlip, who has supervision of the
Secret Service Bureau, and be felt that a
Kre:Â«t responsibility lay on his shoulders.
John E. Wilkie. a Chicago newspaper
man, had. recently been made chief of the
bureau at ilr. Vanderlip's suggestion, ami
tn him fell the task of running the coun
terfeiters to earth. As a police reporter
and then city editor of one of Chicago's
biggest dailies he had done some remark
ably clever detective w >rk: Indeed, it was
his record there th:u had recommei
him to Mr. Vanderllp. He now set about
his task with a will, and the result has
abundant!] '.iis superior's confi
dence in him.
Tho Secret Service Bureau owes not n
little of its success to the secrecy of iis
methods, and the precise* processes it etn
i m this case are not to be revealed.
Even its own employes worked in imior
ar.ee of each other's movements. No two
detectives were allowed to meet and while
one man was at work on one branch of
the mystery other agents were employed
to watch him.
The greater frequence of the detection
of these spurious certificates in the neigh
borhood of Philadelphia pointed to the
ijtijiker City as the field of the counter
f( Iters' operations. Accordingly the
shurpi-st detectives in tht bureau were ? p t
to work thf-re. The certificates were so
skillfully made fhat they were evidently
the work of no ordinary criminals. Final
ly every expert engraver in Philadelphia
was made the subject of the most rigid
espionage. His business affairs, his so
cial relations, his psrsonal habits were
subjected to the most careful scrutiny,
and wherever he went he was faithfully
shadowrd by the sleuthhounds of the law.
Presently it was noticed that the firm
of Taylor & Bredell, having offices at 830
Filbert street, was not doing a large
pnouph business to warrant them in
resorting to "louse work." Then it was
recalled that in 1897 the firm had sus
â¢ relations with two tobacco men in

T.ancsster. Pa.â William M. Kenrtig and
William L. Jacob?. The first was a to
warehouseman and tho second
was h cigar manufacturer, and they had
already Incurred the suspicion of the ln
le officials.
Jacobs, it seems, had been selling his
cigars at a rat" that other cigar men
declared left no margin for profit if he
conducting h legitimate business.
'ver, he had bought only $25,000
worth of revenue stamps, but his busi
was so largi that it ought to have
paid twice that sum to the Internal rev
enue. Putting these facts together, the
Internal revenue officers began a quiet
Investigation, and eventually came to the
conclusion that his revenue stamps were
ovine.
I'h'y bad matters all ready to swoop
down on hnn when in the course of their
Investigations they were brought in con
tart with the secret service men. The
latter were not ready for their grand
coup, for they had nnt yet located the
makers of the count. -rfiit stamps. Ac
cordlngly, the Internal revenue officials
were given the tip to "lay low" for a
while.
When the detectives who had been
drawing the coils about Taylor Bredell
recalled these facts they fÂ«-lt that they
had their game well In hand. A few
clever men were sent to Lancaster, and
soon managed to get employment in
Jacobs' factory and Kendig's warehouse,
and though the two arch-conspirators
were very wary, the bawkshawa soon had
all the evidence they wanted.
Karly on tne morning of Wednesday,
April V.X a double raid was made. Jacobs'
cigar factory was seized by officers of
the Internal Revenue Service and tl
( ret service men gathered In Kendig'a
warehouse. The properties are not own
ed by Kendig and Jacobs, but everything
in them was confiscated under the stat
utes permitting this step when tobacco
manufacturers evade the revenue tax. in
Jacobs' place were found leaf tobacco,
and fixtures to the value of &

it was In the Kendig* place that the
counterfeiting plant was round. It 01 <u
pied much of the second an.i third I
of the building, and was the must com
plete plant ever known in this country.
Th^re were great vats for the manufac
ture of the peculiar paper used by the
Government in making notes and stamps
âa process in itself as Illegal as making
the plates or printing the notesâ plates of
notes, certificates and stamps of several
denominations, elaborate presses, and, in
fact, all the paraphernalia of a fully
equipped private mint.
The plates included face and back of
the "Monroe Head" $100 silver certifi
cates: face and back of the "Everett
Head" $50 silver certificates; partly fln-
Ished face and back of the "Lincoln
Head' $100 treasury notes; three ten
stamp 60-cenl cigar plates, and other
not< B of various denominations.
In Jacobs' place were found printed to
bacco stamps in great quantity.
The counterfeiters had on hand about
nine tons of the stamp paper ready to be
printed on. This is a greater supply tha;i
the Government Itself possesses and is
enough to provide stamps for 400.000,000
eirars. [i was obtained live years ago
from a manufacturer who has since died,
and it is perfect, even to the "l T . S. I.
R," watermark. This was obtained with
out exciting the manufacturer's sus
picions by the statement that it was in
tended for certificates for a "United So
ciety for the Institution of Research" or
some such secret organization.
Arthur Taylor and Baldwin S. Bredell,
the two engravers, have confessed, de
claring that their relations with Jacobs
and Kendig began five years ago, when
they made the first tobacco stamps. Bre
dell is a mechanic of the highest order,
having invented a geometric lathe and a
pantograph, and he is an expert trans
ferrer, while Taylor Is an absolute mas
ter of photo-etching on steel and has in
vented a process of his own that is su
perior to anything known up to this time.
As for Jacobs and Kendip. they have
been known for years in Lancaster a*s
successful business men. The finger of
suspicion has been pointed at Jacobs from
time to ' time, and he has certainly beer.
in some rather shady transactions. But
that these ' two staid and seemingly re
spectable citizens should be at the head

feiters ever known in this country is a

work on their own initiative, their pur

What Shall We Do With Cuba?
By flrjdrew Carnegie.
THIS is not an open question. The honor of the United States is
pledged to assist Cuba to its independence. That this pledge should
be honorably fulfilled goes without saying.
All the volunteer troops are being brought home from Cuba as
fast as transports can be obtained. Secretary Alger is now in Cuba
to hasten their return. If, after the Cubans have organized an independ
ent government, they ask admission to the Union, that question will have
to be carefully considered. The action of Congress upon it is problemati
cal. It is very doubtful whether it will be admitted. I do not believe
that it is best for the United States that it should be.
The South as a body may be expected to oppose it. The Southern peo
ple have had some experience of the race problem, and know that any
further entanglements should be avoided if possible. The conservative
American New England States will not be inclined to favor the admis
sion of a foreign element to affect our national affairs. Louisiana will op
pose Cuban sugar coining in free. The farming States of the West will
do the- same for the same reason; they are now busily engaged in build
ing up the sugar beet industry. The iron ore States of Michigan, Wiscon
sin and Minnesota, as well as those of Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia,
will oppose the free admission of the ironstone of Cuba, being mined by
sixty-oents-per-day labor.
Under these circumstances I am glad to believe we shall be saved from
soon incorporating any other rave than our own into the American Union.
Should Cuba be largely settled by our own people in the course of time
the chief objection to incorporation in the Union would be removed.
All the advantages that ran be obtained by the United States from
annexation will be ours if Cuba becomes independent. It will be under the
Monroe doctrine and free from foreign interference.
It is to be expected that there will be some, and perhaps a good deal,
of disorder in Cuba before a stable government is evolved, but the school
of experience is the only one in which a people can be t:iusht the art of
Belf-government, and any sacrifice that is required is fully justified by the
blessing' which is bound to come sooner or later.

The forewarning of this storm brought
great credit to the observatory, and ever I

throughout the Philippine archipelago.
Its fame as a predi-ter of typhoons ox

fact that the British Government was

the same desire, and eventually, in re- ,

under two Jesuit Fathers as director and

of employes were assigned to the various
labors of the institution, a regular sub- ;
vention being allowed for its mainte- I
nance. The same decree also establi
a series of minor meteorological stations
along the coast of Luzon, which should ;
be in telegraphic communication with the i

observatory have also written and in

with other learned -bodies and has sent
niit several important expeditions, adding
much to the sum of human knowledge.
In March, 1886, the observatory was
transferred from the walled city to the
handsome block of buildings it now oc
cupies in the suburb of Errnita. At the
same time two new departmi nts were
.-uiiiid. ihe s- Ismical or earthquake de

They were officially recognized by the
Spanish Government in 1888, liberal sal
aries being assigned to the officials em

At tli.' â¢â mi ij 1892 thi' directorate of the
Manila Observatory was officially invited
to attend the Meteorological Congress at

were commissioned to assist at this con

extended their Journey to Europe, and on
their return enriched the Manila oÂ»serv

PROFESSOR HENRY SOHLICH
TER re. ently read before the
British Geographical Society an
account of his explorations of a
most wonderful group of ruins
in South Africa. At the same time he
made the claim that the land of Ophir
was back in the hills behind the ancient
city.
Not for many years haÂ« any paper
excited the Interest am<>ng*the learned
members of the Geographical Society
that this has. The discussion follow
ing its reading was long and vigorous
and in the end it was decided that Pro
fessor Schllchter's discoveries were the
most important that had been made
in archaH.^y during the last twenty
five years. It was also agreed that
the ruins referred to were to be ranked
as the most important south of the
equator.
With this conceded tho Importance of
the discoveries in South Africa can
I ardly be estimated. They will change

world. These ruins are thf only traces
of old world civilization found in the
southern hemisphere.
About a year ago Professor Pchlichter
left England for tho purpose of explor
ing the ruins in South Africa. His
route lay through the Transvaal and
Matabeleland, to which he devoted con
siderable timr^without gaining any par
ticular knowledge, except some details
in regard to the construction of the old
Portuguese forts.
But while working in the field hÂ«
heard from prospectors and cattlemen
of the Motnbo, Inyaga ami Zimhabye
ruins that have proved to be so won
derful. It appears that the existence
of the Mombo ruins has been known
for many years, as they are not far
from Bufuwayo, but no scientist had
ever made an examination of them.
Following are some selections from
the pappr read by Professor Sohllohter:

oould not possibly have been made " by
African savogos, while they coincide in
every respect with other finds which Bent
and others have made in Zfmbabye."
One of. the pictures Is an Image of the
pun analogous to#he sun pictures' which â¢
Mauch and. Bent -found on the monoliths
of Zimbabye. and 'analogous also. to finds
in Asia Minor which belong to the'Assyro-
Babylo.riian ' period."-;" And j this image of
the sun has his position directly behind
the zodiacal image of Taurus, and be
tween the fifrns of the Taurus and the
Gemini. But we know that in early an
tiquity the beginning of the year was rep
resented by the zodiacal sign' of Taurus-.
Therefore this position "f the image of
the Bun on our Zimbabye zodiac points
directly to the early times of antiquity.
But this Interesting document furnishes
us also with a b md proof, because the
center of the offering dish is represented
,by a crocodile, which, as Sir Norman
Lockyer has proved, was frequently used
in antiquity as representing the polar con
stellation .of the Northern Hemisphere.'
Moreover, it- is important that to this very
day- the Matokos have a crocodile wor
ship. Furthermore, it is interesting to
note that in ancient Ecrvnt the symbol
Why Professor Schlichter Believes the Newly Discovered Ruins Are the
Site of Ancient Ophir.

'1 2. Zimbabye was built about 1100 B. C. ~
y 3. A Phoenician and Jvdaic trade with Ophir is proved to have been in existence (to take the n&r- o

2 These are the facts, and on the present occasion I will abstain from drawing more detailed conclusions. O
One thing, however, appears to me to be established beyond doubt, through the investigations of
Mauch, Bent and myself, viz.: that the territories known to-day as Southern Rhodesia were, 1000 years

for the commencement of the year was
the imaÃe of a hawk. This hawk was. as
â¢is very well known, likewise the symbol
of Km the Kirn god of tho ancient Egyp-
Uansr and hawks were also worshiped in
Zlmbabye, as has been conclusively
proved by Mauch, Bent, Posselt and
othe r*.
All these Various points show that there
was an early connection between the Zim
babye cok>niÃtÂ« ami the races of antiquity
which practiced solar worship and astron
omy. Thnt Zimbabye is of ancient Semitic
or Egyptian origin can no longer be
doubted, but T have further additional
evidence to that effect.
In IW7, when I was at Tnyanga. examin
ing the numerous ancient slave pits there.
T was fortunate enough to discover what
I believe to be an ancient inscription, of
which several letters are still perfectly
legible and well incised. It has an archaic
and quaint appearance, and I havp al
ready mentioned that it is of ancient
Semitic origin.
In order to further investlKate this
problem I have pone very carefully
through the Old Testament, where tho
much-discussed trade in Bold production,
etc.. in connection with the mysterious;
country of Ophir, Is described. I was sur
prised to find that a number of direct
analogies between Zimbabye and the ear
ly Israelite worship exist. In the first In
stance the treatment of the stones in
ZJmbabyo, without chisels and other Iron
Implements, finds its direct confirmation
in tho old Judaic religion. Solomon's
temiile was likewise built of unhewn
stones. ;md ill tv.o further passages we
are told thut the use of Iron in the con
struction of worship places was consider
ed a crime by the ancient Israelites.
Moreover, it is interesting that in the
Books of Kings, which were written
about 600 years B. ('. an old sacerdotal
rhyme Is found which dates undoubtedly
from th<> tenth century B. C, and refera
to a time In which, us we know through
Professor Wellhausen's investigations,
the ancient Israelites were by no means
addicted to the high and pure monotheis
tic worship which made tli-ir religion
later on so Infinitely superior to the wor
ship of the Burrouading nations. But at
the time in question the Israelites were
still addicted (as many passages of the
Old Testament prove) to a solar and as
tral worship, similar to that of the an
cient Egyptians, Phoenicians and Arabi
ans. This important pasage re. ids (ac
cording to Professor Kautzseh's verbatim
translation of the Bo.fk of Kings). "Jah
weh placed the sun in the firmament of
heaven, bul he said be wduld dwell in
darkness. Xow. i have surely built thee
a house to dwell in. a settled place for
thee to abide in forever." This is a di.
rert analogy to the Zimbabye worship.
Thorp wo have the same fact, viz., that
the worship took place In the interior,
and that the sacred indosure was in the
darkest part of the temple.
But this ancient Hehrew sacerdotal
rhyme is still more characteristic in
another respect. While In the year
fiOO B. C, when the First Book
of Kings was written. this solar
worship was still distinctly noticeable.
we have th* characteristic fact before us
that three hundred years latr>r, when tho
Judaic religion was far more advanced
and refined, and already In its highest
moral development, the "Chronicles" were
written, which are, as is woll known,
more or less a modified copy of the Book
of Kings. And there we notice that the
first verse of the sacerdotal rhyme just
mentioned is suppressed and that also the
reference to the dwelling of Jahweh is
modified. This Is in complete accordance
with the enormous progress of the Judaic
religion in the direction of the exalted
monotheism which characterizes it.
From what I have said, we see that,
like rrfany other indications belonging to
the same period, the archaic ami unde
veloped Semitic worship of the Israelites
was in close connection with the solar
worship of other members of the great
Semitic family, including Phoenicians,
Assyrians, Babylonians, etc. The analogy
becomes still more interesting to those
who believe In Professor Wellhausen's
interesting theory, who Is of opinion that
before the detailed Judaic code of worship

was discovered In the year 623 B. C. solar
and astral worship was everywhere prac
ticed among the ancient Israelites.
Very important for; our subject-matter
me, .turttmta^tito* â .rmiortie* derived from
Arabia. I have airm.lv shown in the
Geographical Journal (July, 1593) that the
Sabacans and other tribes of Southwest
ern Arabia entertained close commercial
relations with the territories on the east
coast of Africa. Moreover, it is interest
ing to note that the ancient Arabian re
ligion was also analogous to the Zimbabye
worship, being likewise a worship of the
sun and other heavenly bodies. , It is ; a
further confirmation of what I have men
tioned, that, according to Doughty's and
Pietschmann's investigations, in North
western Arabia ancient monuments exist
which' correspond to the Zimbabye. con
structions. There we have, the same solid
conical structures regularly composed of
unhewn -stones which we find at Zim
babye. Trie Arabs of to-day call these'
structures Riqum. I. paid particular at
tention to this point-when I was at Zim
babye. I found that not only the large
tower and the small tower in the great
circular ruin but also some of those on
Zimbabye Hill are absolutely analogous
constructions.
â  How far the anciant Phoenician Nura
gen in Sardinia are connected with the
Zimbabye constructions I will not decide
at present, as they are beyond the sphere
of my investigations; but I should not be
.surprised if we should find further con-
nectlng iinkp. And T remember that the
late Mr. Bent, In a discussion on this sub
ject, mentioned to me that he had found
something similar in Upper Egypt. Also
the late Mr. Phillips, a well-known Eng
lish trader In Matabeleland, stated, as far
as my memory goes, that he found a simi
lar monument more to the west In Mata
beleland.
Summing up all these facts, we come to
the conclusion that we have a Semitic
cult of a very remote time before us.
Bent remarks that he nowhere discovered
burfal grounds or graves. But I have
found, north of Inyanga, what I believe
to be an extensive, burial ground. Owing
to the absolute want of boys at the time
being, I was unfortunately prevented
from doing any excavation work thereon.
It is a great pity that when, some time
back, some prospectors of what 's called
"Thr Ancient Ruins Company" found a
number of ancient graves and got out of
them considerable quantities of gold, they
did not keep the human skeletons which
tnev found.
From all the astronomical calculations
I could make with the pyramids now
standing, I found a date us far back as
1100 B. C. Of course, the cities may have
been built before this.
The Mombo ruins have .been visited by
prospectors, etc., before me. but no In
vestigation of them has ever been made.
In size these ruins (which I call, after the
district In which they are situated) are
somewhat smaller than the Zimbabye
temple, but In construction and ornamen
tation they are superior to it and far more
interesting than Zimbabye.
The Mombo ruins consist of a number of
buildings, of - which the . central corre
sponds >.to,.thÂ£_circular temple In - Zimba
byo. while the others are additional In
closures and fortifications. The central
building is, from an architectural and
astronomical point of view, the most in
teresting ruin south of the equator. The
appearance of. it is. as I. have mentioned
before, similar to the Zimbabye temple,
but the difference between the two is (and
I know no better comparison) that of an
early Roman basilica of simple" feature
compared with that of a cathedral of the
most refined .Gothic period. While we
haye on the outside wall of the. Zimbabye
temple only one astronomical pattern and
only a few indications of them on Zim
babye hill, the principal building of the
Mombo ruins is literally covered with as
tronomical ornamentations. In spite of
various jjaps, I have counted not less than
twenty-three different ornamentations of
the best workmanship.
â¢ The length of the central Mombo ruin
(as far as the gaps allow to measure it)
is 185 feet, and its average width seventy
feet, and the whole appearance is, like
Zimbaby*e, that of an ellipse. On the
western side of the interior of this build
ing Is an extensive artificial platform of
the same cpment which is found in the in
terior of Zimbabye, but it has. different
from the latter, a much greater elevation,
in order to have a perfect view over the
surrounding country. The northern por
tion of this central building is formed by
three high terraces, beautifully executed,
which abruptly end toward the true
north. They are decorated with Zimbabye
and other patterns. This arrangement,
together with the platform, is analogous
to the astronomical ornamentation of
Zimbabye and I.undl.
The eastern part of the building consists
of a number of smelting furnaces, of the
same cement as the platform. Most of
these furnaces are partly destroyed but
1 found one which is almost intact. South
of the principal building are heaps of rub
bish, where remnants of blowpipes, cruci
bles and quartz are frequent, which can
leave no doubt that gold production was
the object of the furnaces just described.
We recognize therefore in these Mombo
ruins the identical features which my
predecessors and myself have ascertained,
viz. : (1) solar ' worship, (2) fortifications
and (3) gold production. Moreover, I am
fully convinced that the great number of
different ornamentations which the plan
shows you had. apart from solar worship,
also to do with the observation of the
principal planets and stars; but I was not
in a position to spend the time necessary
to Investigate this point thoroughly.
As the platform from which the obser
vations were taken is at present in a very
dilapidated state and as it will take weeks
to mathematically arrange and dieeern
the different patterns, while I had only
days at my disposal, I considered it best
to mÂ«ke as carefully as I could the plan
of the building before you. and I hope
that either somebody else. or myself wi'l
soon be in a position to ascertain all these
further details. This will not be difficult,
as the Mombo ruins are easily accessible,
being only a short â¢distance from the main
road between Bulawayo* and Gwelo. A
police camp is only eight miles off. and
the excellent farm and store of Mr. Rixon
(who is known all over Matabeleland) is
also in close proximity.
After all that I have explained, T should
like to' say a few words about the much
discussed question of ODhir. I am well
aware that this name has a somewhat
mysterious and unscientific sound. But
this is unjustified. At the time when
L,assen, Gesenlus, Petermann. and others
discussed the Ophir question it was from
want of definite details that theories of a
somewhat unscientific - character were
started, thus discrediting to a certain ex
tent in the course of the years the whole
problem. But nothing is more unjustified,
because, the basis of the whole Ophir
problem, viz., the reports of the- Old Tes
tament.', are In every respect. reliable and
well defined' and are, from a scientific
point of viewjust as good as the reports
of Herodotus, Ptolemy, Pliny and others.
My first step in this direction was to
examine at what time the various authors
of the Old Testament have written their
. PAGES. U
25 to 32 [g
reports about Ophir, because it is evident
that at the time when the word Ophir
waa in everybody's mouth without any
further explanation the colony. of Ophir
. could not poÃ*lbly have boÂ»Â»n a/tnatter of
the past. Tile result Is that all the re
norts of the Old Testament were written
in the period between GOO and 164 B. C.
With this fact we have gained a firm
basis for the discussion whether Ophir
wrs in India or Africa. Fortunately, the
same period comprises the exploits of the
man who first explored India, viz.. Alex
ander the Great. Among his followers
were many who would have collected
news about a gold belt in India, provided
that the latter was actually existing. But
no gold country whatever existed there.
On the contrary, all Indian tribes were
almost devoid of gold, and Arianus, our
best and most reliable source of informa
tion about the campaigns of Alexander
the Great, states as emphatically as pos
sible as follows:
"Alexander and his army have refuted
most of. the stories in this direction, with
the exception of some who have obviously
made incorroct statements. It hns thus
been ascertained that all the Indians
through whose territory Alexander and
his army marched (and he marched
through many of themi have no gold."
Therefore it is evident that India cannot
possibly be the Ophir of antiquity.
Now, we know that, with regard to
Ophir only the coast countries of the Tn
dian Ocean can come into' consideration,
and Arabia and Equatorial East Africa
have been mentioned in connection with
the Ophir problem.. But against this as
sumption, stands "the clear text of the
three most reliable and oldest passages in
the Old Testament, viz.â Kings, ix:26-"2S,
and x:ll-22. It is absolutely unintelligible
to me how any one who compares these
passnges in a literal and critical trans
lation (for instance, that by Professor
Kautsch) can assert that the passage in
chapter x, verse 22. does not deal with
Ophir, as it is most emphatically stated
that we have to deal with a sea naviga
tion which extended tn remote countriesâ
in fact, to the end of the then known
world, and it is therefore clear that this
gold land of antiquity could neither have
been on the coast of the Red Sea. nor on
that of Equatorial Africa or Arabia. To
what extent, however, the Arabians, es
pecially the Sabaeans, were engaged and
interested in the trade with Ophdr I have
shown in some of my previous publica
tions, and it would lead too far to repeat
it here.
Summing up. we have the following
facts:
1. An inscription of undoubtedly ancient
Semitic characters.
2. Zimbabye was built about 1100 B. C.
3. A Phoenician and Judaic trade with
Ophir is proved to have been in existence
(to takethe narrowest limits) between 950
and 850 B. C. ' .
. 4. Between 600 and 164 B. C. more than
a dozen reports referring to Ophir are in
existence in the Old Testament, and Ophir
is used in them as a household word.
. 5. The fact that Alexander found no
gold belt in India.
6. Herodotus, during the same period,
describes farthest Ethiopia as one of the
most extensive gold-producing centers in.
the ancient world.
These are the facts, and on the present
occasion I will abstain from drawing mors
detailed conclusions. â¢
One thing, however, appears to me to
be established beyond doubt, through thÂ«
investigations of Mauch, Bent and myself,
viz.â that the territories known to-day as
Southern Rhodesia were. 1000 years before
the commencement of the Christian era,
a gold producing country of a large ex
tent, and colonized by the early Semltio
races round the Red Sea, viz.â by Jews;
Phoenicians' and Western Arabians. The
Rhodesia ruins . are the first discovered
traces of an "Old World" civilization on
the Southern Hemisphere, and they form.
as already Carl Rltter expressed it, one
of the most interesting links between an
cient and modern geography.

ABOUT STAGE-STRUCK GIRLS
Pear Madam: I am a young. girl
â who would like to become an
actress. I have ambition and talent
and am sure I would succeed If I
could only get a chance to get on
the stage. But the only thing is.
I don't know how lo get on the
stage, so it is that I ask you if you
will tell me what to do, as I cannot
afford to learn to become an act
ress. VALERIE.
Brooklyn, X. Y.
THERE are, my <lear young lady, fi
variety of ways of â¢"getting on the
stage." If you have a great deal of
money and inllfaence you can hire
managers to anow you to take .1
small part in some play, and even
star you in a third-class company
to go to obscure towns.
If you are willing 'to give up all com
fort and violate every, itile of health you
might even without money or influence
find a place in some 'raveling company
and go â¢'barn-storming." To do this- you
will have to haunt dramatic agencies and
hang about them as domestics hang about
intelligence offices, only with about one
hundredth the chance of obtaining a sit
uation. Unless you are very beautiful
or very magnetic or very pushing,' or all
three, your chance of getting on the stage
through the agencies is remote, as there
are twenty girls waiting for every open
ing. , > â 
You might marry ami obtain a divorce
under sensational circumstances, become
notorious and then hire yourself out to
some manager who .Ikes that sort of a
"star." But this takes a long time, and is
full of risks. You run the chance of fall
ing in love with your husband and not
wanting to divorce, and think how disas
trous that would be to a "career."
I know one actress who was asked to
go on the stage by a manager who. met
her and was Impressed by her beauty and
magnetism. Another who walked into an
office with her school books slung over
her shoulder walked out engaged as
an understudy for a leading lady. But
such cases are rare and can only be ac
counted for by a belief in "luck." .
Hundreds of girls are haunting agencies
all over America who never obtain posi
tions; scores knock at managers' doors
who are never allowed to enter, and
scores who enter go lorth with despair
written on their faces.

They belong to third >r fourth rate com
panies and pass their lives in a drudgery
far worse than that of a shop girl. They
live at cheap country hotels and on way
trains. They retire at 1 o'clock and- rise
at 3 to "make" the next one-night stand.
They dine on doughnuts and sand
wiches bought at the bakery en route to
th.- station.
Their expenses cover their salaries,
and they are always poor and usually in
debt, for the associations of theatrical
life do not act as Incentive to economy
or thrift.
It requires a character of remarkable
strength and nobility to retain high
of life in c theatrical career. The
very tact of being "somebody else" be
side! 'Hies own sÂ« If. year in and 'out,
creaies a tendency toward insincerity,
which affects the brain cells and eventu
ally the whole life conduct.
The world has known 'a few great actors
who were also great men and women in
principle and character.
But they have been very few. Examples
of greatness in all other professions are
far more numerous.
Th>- artist, the ECUlptor, the author,
the composer is himself when he Is doing
his greatest work. But the gnat actor
sinks himself in one, two or a dozen other
in rsonalities, and his own individuality
is dwarfed and often perverted by the
characters he assumes.
It is well to consider all these things be
fore you stake your all upon a theatrical
career. And after you have summed up
the possibilities and probabilities you had
best sit down and ask yourself if the at

adopt her own. Arguments end in dis
cord, and trouble ensues. The religion
which is based upon the commandment
to "love one another" leads to qnarrela
and hatred.
Even where people are too sensible and
well bred to allow such serious result 3
to ensue, much sorrow and estrangement
frequently arises from a difference in re
ligious views, especially where there are
children.
People can be very hanny in married
life who have opposite opinions on every
matter save mutual love and loyalty. But
they need to be broad-minded, good-tem
pered and well balanced to mee.t such a
situation.
Without riuestion there is a safer pros
pect of happiness for a man and wife
whose tastes are similar and whose
habits of thought are in harmony.
1 know of a serious quarrel which oc
curred between a newly married couple
because the young wife went sailing one
hot Sunday afternoon with her relatives
and her strictly orthodox husband consid
ered that she had broken the Sabbath by
so doing, and endeavored to scold and
nag her Into his convictions.
It is the highest possible ideal of mar
riage when two people find themselves
physical mates, mental comrades and
spiritual companions. In order to be all
this they need not pursue the same voca
tions nor belong to the same church
Intellectual and spiritual sympathy and
toleration are all that are nedded to cre
ate happiness and harmony.
I once heard a great Hindoo teachnr
say "Think of God as the ocean and
the varying creeds as pitchers of differ
ent shapes, which human brines itrÂ«

each is filled with divine love what doe!

She has a good musical ear. yet she will
never become a great musician. She is
sensitive and delicately organized. There

health, not allowing her to be excited in.
her early years. she will by the time she

not live to fulfill the career fate has in

One or two of the tailci and several

Now am! then a red kowii waa seen on

A woman there was who had heard a

From flesh and bones and a lock' of hair
(He called her the woman beyond com

But. he only used her to lighten his care,

O. the walks we had and the talks we
had,
And the best of our h"art and hand

to care,
Me didn'tâ but why he pretended to care
We cannot understand.
A woman received the flowers he sent.

Honor and faith she thought his intent

O, the vows wo epoke and the vows we

And tho various thing* wÂ« planned
Belong to tho man who said he was true

And we cannot understand.
One favor she askedâ but it was denied,

Her faith in him faltered and finally died,

IF there ever is a time vtifii a woman i
longs to be an ostrich, that 3he may
go and bury her head In the Band, ;
it is when she is in .the last stages of !
a shampoo. Have you ever seen a
woman that was pretty under those
circumstances? I never have. How '
could she be with freight, damp locks ]
hanging in her eyes.and little wisps and ;
ends of hair sticking, out haystack fash
lon all over her head? it is the on< time ;
when one is mentally thankful that one's i
"dearest and best" is not around to be- j
hold the woeful sight.
n-.:: after the hair . has been dried and ;
fussed over, waved and kinked and !
twisted up into a soft, fluffy massâ ah, j
what a change is there, my country- j
! women!
It is the most difficult thing in the
! world to gay how often the hair should ;
. be shampooed and which method is the j
I best. It depends upon the nature and â â 
quality of the hair and condition rf each
Individual scalp. When the hair is light ;
] and fluffy it indicates a lack of oil In i.ie !
j oil glands or tha' they are Inactive In I
such cases the head should be wash< d
jio of toner than absolute cleanliness of j
the scajp demands, for. If soap be used,
be it ever so little, it will further de- j
plete the already small supply of natural j
If however, the hair is overburdened :
! with natural qil. and soon becomes !
â  matty and greasy, it should bi washed ;
I at least every fortnight. -'V/- : >-V- ; .
It is a mistake to ihink ihat the hair !
and scalp cannot be thoroughly cleansed !
without the use of soap. A shampoo i
1 made of the yolks of two eggs, beaten |
to a froth, end added to one pint of warm i
water and <>ne ounce of rosemary spiiits, ,
if thoroughly rinsed from the hair in sev- i
eral clear waters, will cleanse it better j
than all the soaps in the world. . ridding ,
; the scalp of dandruff and 'leaving the j
: hair beautifully silky and smooth. â  â  â¢.,
For those of you who do not care for |
, plain castile soap, but wish a line lathery i
shampoo, I would suggest the following::

The propel way to shampoo the head is i
to have ready a basin of very. warm water .
j and whatever you intend to use a? a |
] shampoo. Thoroughly wet the hair with j
; the. cleansing tiuld and then with the \
I fingers rub well the scalp until every j
I bit of dandruff and "ireisn matter have i
', become loosened, when the v.'arm water !
j must be used- to remove the lather. The j
j best way to rinse the hair Is by means of j
i a bath spray. If, however, you do not I
happen to have one. rinsing in several
clear waters, pouring" it over the head
freely, will answer the same purpose.

SCHOOL FOR
NURSE MAIDS
BOSTON' has started a new school â
the first of its kind in this coun
tryâfor the proper training of
nursemaids.
No girl under 18 or more .than 30 years
old is received as a pupil, anil before a
pupil Is taken into the institution she
must show evidence of a common school
education and recommendations as to her
moral character. She must also pledge
herself to wear a uniform after she grad
uates and net to ask more than 15 a
week "wages for the first year.
This school for nursery maids Is con
nected with the Wesf End Pay Nursery.
The girls have their home in the instltu-
sunlight. It', however, you have civ sen

Neither ammonia nor borax, unless in i
very small Quantities, should ever be used .
In washing hair that is naturally dry and
possible harsh and brittle. Both are
drying In their effect. Ammonia Is said.
to occasion premature grrayness. and. in 'â 
my opinion, its In'dlscrimfnatP use is re- '
sponslble for more'thin locks of the pres

what clothing is best for the little ones
under varying conditions, how to PUtlt

need of trustfulness on their part and the
great crime of frightening children are
firmly impressed on them. They are

they are given lessons ln plain laundry

Positions are found for the pupils two

"Confidence" under apother namo? I am
sure it -is. Acne, which Is the medical
term for your affliction, is most obstinate
always. Absolute cleanliness Is positively
necessary, lirst of all. Steaming the face
until every unimpeded pore is in a.n active
condition and (he contents of the inactive
ones arc softened is an excellent method.
The face should always be dried after
.-:â¢ nmlng and care should be taken to rtn
it thoroughly enough to remove every
thing that may have exuded, however
Invisibly, from the torpid pores. You
wash your face altogether too often. A
thorough washing at night with tepid \
â water and castile soap find a rinsing In
clear tepid wnter in the morning is all
that is necessary. Hathine the face In
diluted witch hazel, followed by massage
with a cold cream, will sometimes work j
wonders In cases of acne. You can use \
the tooth powder as frequently as you
choose. Profuse perspiration is enough to i
drive one to the dreadful soda-water
habit. Put a little baking soda in your
bath and. after drying the body careful
ly, dust the hands and armpits with ;i
powder made of one part of boracic acid.
two parts precipitated chalk and seven
parts powdered talcum. Wear bits of
absorbent ontton sprinkled with this In
the palms of your gloves and. perhaps,
life will once more become jolly and ro
seate for you. I^o write to me again.
ANXIOUS MATâ Use 'he following
tonic upon your falling tresses. It is a
sure dandraff cure and will put a speedy
slop to the hnir Bheddtng itself in that
unhappy Tvav: Forty-eighl prralna resof
cin, one-fourjh ounce glycerin and alco
hol sufficient to Hi. a two-ounce bottle.
Apply tf> th* scalp every night, rubbing
It in well.
TI I.T.iK W.- Advice to Duchess is the
Fame that I would give to you. Please
read what 1 have said to hi-r. For the
crowsfeet and tines in neck, massage with
the orange lluwer skin food.
LEO J. â The formula that you sent m<Â»
Is a fac<> bleach. It accomplishes Its pur
pose by removing the outer cuticle, which,
to my mind, is always accompanied with
more or less risk. My advice to you
would be to use nothing stronger on your
face in the way of a bleach than lemon
juice. If you will put a little of this on
your face at night and after it has dried
on the skin apply a good cold cream, you
will find that it will whiten your skin
nicely. Bit hloride of mercury is a deadly
poison, and 1 never recommend any lo
tion of which it is an Ingredient.
JASMINK â The moth patches cannot be
removed as long as the disordered con
dition of the liver, wnicta causes thorn,
remains. Get your physician to give, you
a good liver medicine, and when that or
gan is In good condition, if the patches
still remain, bleach their, out with fre
quent applications of lemon iuice or per
oxide of hydrogen. The skin food is tine
for a dry skin. There Is nothing better.
The cost of the ingredients would be
about 40 cents. 1 fancy. Inquiry at a
drug store would inform you better on
this point. Cocoanut oil rubbed Into the
eyebrows will increase their growth
A BEAUTT SEEKER I have said so
much lately about the hair growing and
non-hair growing properties of creams
and s cm foods that 1 will take it for
granted that you have read and so been
Informed. Once a day. just before retir
ing, is often enough to use the skin food.
MISS ANXIOUSâ If you read my re- !
plies to K. A. E and An Inquirer in last.:
Sunday's Call you found your questions
answered, for I would say to you just
what I said to thrm. The astringent wash
will be particularly excellent in your case
I am certain. Her? 's the formula for a
splendid hair curling iluid: Mis one and a
half drams of gum tragaranth with th.pe â¢
ounces of proof spirits and seven ounces
of water. Perfume with a drop or two
of attar of rose. If too thick add a little
pfbewater. .
MISS ANXIOUSâ As yon are afraid to
use oily preparations on your skin, you
might try thick Bweel cream. It some
times has a wonderfully whitening and
softening effect upon the skin.* Do not
use hot water on your face. Use tepid
water, a complexion brush and castile
soap. After a thorough rinsing in clear
water rub in the cream. .Are you sure the
condition of your skin is not caused by
an inactive liver? I am lined to think
it is. In that case you should s<-e a phy
sician and have him prescribe, a good'
liver tonic. That will put your skin In
better condition than all the beauty lo
tions that were ever invented. I think
the astringent wash, formula for which
has been given s,> many tim^s In this
department, will also aid in clearing and
giving tone to your complexion. Here â¢
is the formula for a splendid hair-curling
fluid: Mix one find a half drams of gum
tragacanth with three ounces of proof
spirits and seven ounces of water. Per
fume With a iir.'T' or two Of attar of rose.
If too thick a<M h little rosewater
R. G. H.â The dye can be bleached off
the hair with applications of peroxide of
hydrogen, \ \i\ 1 should noi advise you to

method in such cases Is to oik of? thÂ« hair
and let it grbw In the natural shade.
DEL MONtK Massape will .help yon if
it is of the right kind, which ir. picking up
of the flesh between irour fingers and
rolling it firmly This treatmeni dissolves
the fatty liningrs nnd will surely reduce
that double chin. 1 should not bother
about the stoutness'of the face. If I were
you. Of course, l efcre the chin I? ma
nipulated it must be smeared with cold
cream, and if a Babbjness of the skip re

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, MAY 7, 1899.
Whereupon Jemimy flouted out and went into the kitchen, where she
weni about breakfast with surprising energy, talking to herself all the
time.
It is impossible to describe the keen disappointment of Buster John
when hi- came down to breakfast and learned of the remarkable "events
night. He was disappointed, first, because he had not been kid
naped with the rest; and. second, because ho had not been waked to Join
In the search. He had an idea that he had been treated unfairly, not by
any particular person or persons, but in some way. It was just his luck,
he said, to be left out when anything very interesting was going to nap
pen. He recalled tho day he remained at home from school on some slight
excuse 'and a pack of hounds ran a gray fox right up to the Bchoolhouse
door and caught it there; and a little later the same day the boys found
a partridge nost right on the verge of the play ground, and the nest had
CM venteen beautiful eggs in it. There were other occasions that he re
membered, and he said to himself and to others that it was pretty hard
thai a girl Bhould be havingsuch a fine time while he was asleep in bed.
But Sweetest Susan declared that it wasn't such a fine time after all.
She was asleep and didn't know anything about it. Nevertheless, she felt
that she had grown in importance by taking part in the adventure and
she put on some of those airs which are very cute in girls of her age, but
which areâ well, not so cute in grown women.
Buster John submitted to them with very good grace, considering that
a a spirited boy. He knew that he would have done some struttfng
himself if Sweetest Susan's adventures had been his. As it was. he con
tented himself with assertions as to what he would have done had he been
in the wagon. He might have gone to sleep at first, he said, but just as
sure as anything he would have waked when the wagon jolted over a rock
or a lump in the road, and then-well, suffice it to say that wagoner would
have f.<und himself in deep trouble. Buster John would have pulled out
his pistol â
"Why, you haven't any pistol; you know you haven't," cried Sweetest
Susan.
"Well, rd have had one If I had been in the wagon. I would have
guessed what was going to happen."
"How came you didn't?" inquired Prusilla at this point. "Why n t you
we wus gwine ter drop off tor sleep? An' why'n't you stay down
-up all" T don't like dish yer kinder guessln' what guesses
n'l no Q( ed er gut-ssin'."
But Buster John insisted that he would have borrowed his grand
father's pistol, and hid himself in the wagon; and when they came to
lark and lonely spot in the road, then and there he would have de
manded satisfaction.
"Huh! He'd 'a' gi' you sati'f action!" exclaimed Drusilla; "he'd 'a'
grabbed you an 1 rolled yo* head In one er dem blakets. an' ef dat ain't
sati'fy you. he'd 'a' gi' 'you sump'n else."
"That's all you know about pistols." said Buster John imperiously.
"No needs ter know 'bout pistols." replied Drusilla. "when you know
'bout folks. Why. honey, dat ar man would 'a' eat you up ef you dcs so
much ez bat yo' eye at 'im. Ain't I done see dÂ© way he chaw vlttles, an'
how he talk 'long wid hissse'f ?"
Nevertheless. Buster John insisted that he would have rescued the
captives and brought them home in triumph.
As may be supposed, the strange adventure of Sweetest Susan and
Drusilla afforded a subject for a great deal of gossip on the plantation
and In the surrounding country. and tn Â© children themselves passed many
a pleasant hour in discussslng it. when otherwise they would have been
very lonely. Sweetest Susan often thought of little Billy Biscuit, and once
when talking about him to her mother she mentioned whai Miss Klviry
ifl children's clothes. Now. as ir hapi re waa

the little waif. Then, womanlike, she insisted that the clothes must be
sent as soon as possible, and gave orders that Johnny Bapter should carry
everything the next morning.
The children, hearing of this, insisted that they be allowed to go along,
and as there was nothing to prevent (Sherman's army having unwittingly
dispersed school and schoolmaster) it was arranged that Johnny Bapter
should use the spring wagon, which had two seats, so that Buster John,
Sweetest Susan and Drusilla could all go along. And as Johnny Bapter
was going that far. he might as well take an early start and go on to Har
mony Grove to cany some gifts of hutter, flour and other supplies to an
old friend of Mrs. Wyche's, whose husband was in the army, and whose
Sources of maintenance had been all but swept away by the army of in
vasion.
The children were up bright and early, but they found Johnny Bapter
nnd the wagon waiting for them. There was not much delay after that,
you may be sure; only a little wait on Drusilla, who was not likely to
allow so short a journey to interfere with the play of her appetite. Buster
John and Sweetest Susan went out to the wagon with half their breakfast
in their hands. Johnny Bapter took off his hat to them very politely
and then, when they were seated in the wagon, he took off. his hat and
bowed twice.
"You're mighty polity this morning, Johnny Bapter," said Butter John.
"What's the matter with you?"
"Well, fust J bow ter vou-all, an' den I bow ter dem er waffles an'
dat ar ham. I ain't see no waffles in so long dat I bleege ter bow at urn.
Dey may not know me, but T knows dem."
That settled it. of course. Johnny Bapter knew what he was doing.
In their exuberant spirits the children would have given him all their
waffles and ham. but no: "I ain't no ways greedy," said Johnny Bapter,
bo he only took two-thirds. "An' de waffles got butter on 'urn!" he ex
claimed. "I'm mighty glad you-all tuck a notion to go 'long. Look liko
dey ain't been no war when you kin git a tas'.e er waffles. Git up dar,
hoss! what you holdin' back, on level gro-un' fer, when you known I'm up
here efltln' waffles? Ef anybody ax you all how come I don't b'long ter

preachers say der's gwinter be waffles up dar whar good folks frq.es. Ef
dey'll dcs say 'waffles' I'm wid urn, an' I'll stay wid urn, too; don't you
disremember datâ
"Fer John-nee Baplter is my name â
You ax my mammy, she'll tell you de same!"
This last wa? a snatch of song: that sounded sweetly on the morning
air. It was accompanied by a shaking of the reins that set the horse
trotting at the top of his speed. In a very short while, as it seemed to the
children, who enjoyed the ride, they were at. Mr. Bobs', where they were
met by Miss Elvlry, who said she was delighted to see them. The clothes
she declared, the very thing, every stitch being in the right place, and
each garment certain to fit a t-wy-tyâ some might be a little too big now
at the preaeni time, but they wouldn't stay too big many days.
"Somethln' told me you-all was a-comin' to-day. T had a' rinprin' in my
right ear, an' my nose has been a-eetchin' ever sence T got up this mornin".
I know'd I was certain to have company, and who could it be, says I to
myself bui the youngsters from the Ahercrombie place?"
"How is little Billy Biscuit?" asked Sweetest Susan.
"As fine as split silk," responded Miss Elvlry with a fond laueh: "as
fat as .1 pig. and the cutest thine: you ever laid eyes on. rnmo right In;
he's back In hire Bome'rs. -Billy! Billy Biscuit! Where are you, for
s' sake?"
"Here me," replied Billy.
"Come here," Baid Miss Elvlry; "here's somebody want to see you."
"Uh-uh! Me taut; me'? a moo-talf. Moo-talf in de pen tan't dit out "
When Miss Elviry and the children w-ent to see what Billy was up to
they found that he had turned a chair on its side, and with that had
penned h'mself in a corner of the room.
"Moo-talf want water." he exclaimed. Miss Elviry would have given
him tome from the gourd, but he protested loudly. "N-o-o-o! Moo-talf
drink cut de pen. " and nothing would do but he must have a pan of water
From this he drank as he had seen the calf drink.
"Did anybody ever see the like of that?" exclaimed Miss Elviry in an
ecstaey of pride. "They ain't narry "nother child in the world, his age
and inches, half a* smart a.Â« he is."
Hilly Biscuit acted aa If h^ thought so. too. Insidp the somewhat nar
row limits <>f his pen he walked to and fro on his all-fours as if trying to
â  [mm If off.
Now, Mis< Elviry could say nothine on behalf of Billy Riscnir's accom
plishments thai Sweetest Susan would n^t agree to. She was very fond
of babl< a and young children and had a peculiar knack of entertaining
them. She felt, too, a special Interest in Billy Biscuit, having been the
means of rescuing him from that unfortunate lunatic, and so she sat on
ceremonies there was a banquet, at which !
Philip Princevalle acted as chairman of
tiie evening. During the evening there
was presented a programme that had for
its attractive features a piano duet, Miss

After the noon meal the royal pair take
a short nap. and at 4 o'clock In the after
noon they take a lons drive.
Kins Humbert devotes his attention to
the minutest details of his household,
economy and order being his watchwords.
Eight o'clock in the evening is dinner
time at the palace. Afterward the King
visits the theater or listens to private
recitations, and he retires promptly at

On many occasions she invites officers of

t.tl.tiOl-LAND^FRITi WILLIAhb AND MAVGALYER- COUUM&IA
Â£-][â 3HERE will commence In th*
Columbia Theater to-morrow
â 
night a long season of Mr.
*â¢* Charles Frohman Presents. It Is
a long time now since \ve have s< en this
valuable name in anything like â¢ rma
nent occupation of the large-typed top
line of the playbill?, and Mr. Charles
Frohman Presents will certainly re
ceive a generous and respectful wel
ro.ne. This rf'me, so Ã¼b'.qultous in
London, New York and In all the bii>
Eastern cities, hÂ«* Ions? been almost a
stranger h-^re. li stands for practically
everything in American theatricals,
and we are much in need of Its pres
ence. In the old ; iyg, when it was
merely Mr. Charles Frohman, we saw
it often and regarded it as we would
regard the name of any reputable man
iicer. Augustin Daly's was about the
only all-important ame then, and we
thought more about the quality of the
Frohman plays nnd iyers than of the
Frohman name, and, not liking me of
these, as you will mber, Mr. Froh
man gently hut firmly withheld his en
terprises, and from his snug, prosper
ous office in Nev York watche us
struggle with a dramatic famine. At
lirst we were very brave and cheerful.
We said to ourselves that Mr. Frohman
had nut been doing his best for us,
anyway; he was not the only manager
in the managery; and we had our lo-
GJu|? stoi-k companies; anJ we could
stand the pangs of separation just as
Inns as he could: and the atrical
syndicate, of which h^> was the head,
shoulders and stomach, ought not to
be encouraged under any circum
stances; and Ffi forth and so forth.
And then the long slow months of
nothing set in. We -made a gorgeous
effort to boom our local companies,
but after a while they became as dull
:is poor relations, and many of us got
altogether out of the habit of going to
the play, and those of us that were
left with our enthusiasm simply
yarned and tarved for a real metro
politan performance of a real play with
a picked cast and a production that
ran on oiled wheels. Our unhaDPiness
leaked into the newspapers, and, see
ing that we had been sufficiently pun
ished, Mr. Frohman took us back to his
heart. Best of all he sent us his full
name and "Secret Service." and not
even tho burning of the Baldwin The
ater could give pause to our gratitude.
We followed Mr. Charles Frohman Pre
sents, William Gillette and "Secret Ser
vice" to the California Theater in
thousands, and we rushed over to Oak
land the few nights the attraction
played there. Since then this manager
has been very busy with a big season
in the East, but we have waited for
him more in sorrow than in a,nger. and
nn\v, it seems, our turn is come at
last. In the Columbia Theater I -mor
row night Mr. Charles Frohman Pre
sents "On and Off," a Bission farce that
is backed by a big itation in New
York and a little one in Chicaeo. and
played by a company that includes
among its members E. M. Holland.
Fritz Williams, Samuel Reed. Ralph
Delmore, James Kearney, James Wil
soh; Essie Tittell, Margaret Gorden.
May Lambert, Anita Rothe, May Gall
yc-r and Louise Douglas.
â¢ â¢ *
The first two acts nf "On and Cff"
are said to be more comedy than farce;
the last, nothing but farce. The story
centers in a sportive young husband,
who falls in love with an up-country
girl, and in order to find time for his
devotions professes to his confiding wife
to have obtained an employment on the
railroad which requires him to be
away from home the half of every
week. When the wife discovers the
situation she hunts down the real em
ploye, whose name her husband has
assumed, and engages with him in a
p-Â»ceful flirtation, which the husband
witnesses but dare not interrupt. The
man whose name he has taken in vain
is soon quartered as the lord and mas
ter of the husband's household. In a
hundred comical ways, one of which
employs a phonograph, the wife's
friends and relations conspire to make
thÂ«> husband believe that he is insane,
with so much success that he begins
to stlon his own Identity. This
much of the plot will serve as an ap
petizer. We"ll know it all to-morrow
r.ight.

Another play of the week that prom
ises to â >â  of i pedal interest is "His
Japanese Wife," a farce by our towns
man. lay M. Gtc*Â»ne, which will v â  pro
duced in the Alcazar to-morrow night
for the first tune on any stage. Since
the Alcaza- has been under the present
management it has given house to but
two real premieres. Both leces were
written by Francis Powers; one, as you
know, waÃ a sensational success, and
the other a rank failure. One success
out of a possible two is a record that
any manager mif?ht be proud of. It is
just fifty per cent better than Mr.
Fiav.lcy Oid. fcr example Mr. Greene

This is what the critic of the New York
Commercial Advertiser writes about a
naught} 1 farce that is booked fur San
Francisco:
"After a I â¢ ' trip into the coun
try, the notorious 'Turtle' has returned
to town at the Grand, without showing
any marked Improvement In Its condition.
The play lias about as much humor in
mposition as when the man fi
the point in the middle of the story and
says, 'Awn, yes, let me see. how did that
how, 11 whs very funny
when ] heard it,' until a friend of his
shifts the conversation m 'o golfing. A
stout wi ..hi with her hair done up in curl
papers and, a man rushing up and down
suiirs in a i : .- Â» ! r of red socks are the two
chief attractions of tin- piece. In the
matter of jokes it would take a small
army of (â¢!"-â¢ packed miracles to bear the
burden of such a play without staggering.
The only tiling left for 'The Turtle to do
is to crawl away by itself to some unfre
quented mudhoie and assume sufficient
decency to die."
Another tainted farce produced in New
York! Read what the World says about
it: "The Manicure," a three-act farce,
produced last' nit'lit at the. Manhattan
Theater, Is reasonably in need of those
services advertised by its originals in
real life. Even then" it is doubtful
whither the most assiduous clipping and
cutting can make it presentable in polite
society, for as the basis of its story it
retains all the conventional thinness and
vulgarity of Its predecessors at the Man
hattan.
Daniel Frohman has consummated an
arrangement with Charles Frohman by
which the Lyceum manager leases to his
brother Charles the Lyceum Theater, by
this means uniting certain of the theatri
cal interests of both brothers to the ex
tent that Daniel Frohman will be enabled
to extend his productions beyond the
Lyceum Theater, to the Lyric, Garden
and Garrick theaters, in conjunction with
Charles Frohman. The Daniel Frohman
Stock company will continue to appear at
the Lyceum, but the arrangement be
tween the brothers will enable them to
exchange the various members of their
companies and to utilize them in any of
the theaters named where productions re
quire them.

ASSOCIATED BANKS' STATEMENT.
NEW YORK. May 6.â The New York Finan- j
cier says this week: Two factorsâ the enor
mous" over-subscription to the shares of the .
Anialapamated Copper Company and the pre- i
llminary operations Incident to the first pay- |
nient of the Philippine indemnity contributed !
toward making a sun>risinK. bunk statement j
for the week ending May 6. The ncreasi of j
J16.C64.400 in loans was far above what had been
expected, as was the expansion of $16,000,000 in '
deposits. It is to be noted that these Items I
almost balance each uther. The changes In the ]
actual cash reserve were not sÂ« important, the !
loss of funds in bank being 52.265.200. Of the I
J6.172.7"5 decrease in reserve ovÂ»r J4,iÂ»Â«).fni.i rep- j
resents added requirements, owing to the |
heavy rise in deposits, The average system of
comput g totals is responsible for an evident 1
discrepancy in several respects, for the state
ment ludes little, if any, of the $5,000,000
drawn from the sub-treasury as the tlrst pay
ment of the Philippine funds. The Kinks lost
something like $i,f!po,o<ifl through the treasury
on roul operations, but gained a# much from
the interior, thoueh the statement does not 1
â 
The' only Inference 3s that the real cash re
serve is about as large as rejxjrted for the \
previous week. . .Of the chanÂ«es Ii loans and
deposits, the National City liank is account
able for ten millions and over on each Item, j
Just what part the copper subscription played â 
In this matter cannot lie figured, but it is ix
noticeable fact that the bunk's total cash j
varies less than three-quartersof a million from
fhe pre\ lous weeks. As the $75.000, (.00. 5t0ck of j
the â  algamated Copper Company was sub
scribed more than four times over, and as each j
subscription was accompanied by a 5 per c*:it :
check, it is evident that thi bank received i
about t2n.ouo.OKi from this source, although,
of course, much of it may not hiive been in- 1
eluded in the averages Regarded in every !
light it cannot be suki that the statement la I
as unfavorable as first thought might mnk" i
it. T: banks, as already noted, are stronger
In cash than is reflected in the current Â»-x- !
hi bit, and IB they will be furthri aided next i
week, through the Treasurj 1 operations, the loss
in reserves now reported are not as import- j
ant as otherwise. Thf changes in the leading '
items imply a shifting of funds more than :
anything else, and while the banks may show :
some surprising changes during the coming i
few weeks. It cannot be satd that thf-lr In
fluence would lÂ»e. other than transitory m na
nira.

BRADSTREET*B TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW, YultK, May â¬.-Um,!Â«tr.M t says:
That this Is, indeed an' <-ru of trade and In
dustrial combination seems evident from the
long list of announcements of new consollda
tions, rumored or actually floated, com 10
public view this week. Whether this tendency
has as yet reached Its culmination cannot, of :
course, be easily predicted, but In 8om<! lines
ol Industry the announcements of projected
lldatlom would seem to lia\Â»- left little
room for further operations of this kind. Kast
ly first In this direction Is the gigantic Iron !
a.nd Bteel combination, announced with seem
ing confidence as in process vi formation. .Sec
ond only to this, however, Is the actual fl .at
ing of the great copper combination, Out
growtha as these great combination! are of Im- !
mense Industrial changes in many lin^s they
possesfi a special Interest in the world ol trade
and finance because of the immense aggrega
tion ol capital or Industry involved in their
projection or their carryir^ out to a BUCcesa
tul tlnisi; While whole-ale trade continues of
a between season volume, every general evi
dence .- forthcoming that the aggregate is in
excess .if last year's undeniably good propor
tions and retail demand In of an encouraging
character. That the volume of fall business
booked la In excesa of the average is vet gen
erail> conceded. Advances In prices and re
ported great activity abroad point to the wide
spread demand for iron and steel, and render
less loubtful the hold of American products
on foreign markets.' The tone of general mar
kets Is notably strong for the season of the
year, a prominent exception being pork and
hog products generally, which have been the
Bubject of bearish manipulations. Cereals are
generally firm, cash wheat being fractionally
higher at the seaboard on Interruption to move
ment by the water route caused by the grain
handlers' strike at Huffalo. while option business
is In a waiting Â«tnxe pending Government report â¢
on wheat conditions and acreage next week
Crop advicea are still contradictory, but good
â weather has made for successful planting and
growth of spring wheat, while foreign crop
advices continue good, and export demand la
of only moderate proportions.. Thlp. coupled
with smaller than expected decreases In \Â»'. r i,is
supplies reported to Bradstreet'a this week
adds aa a check to values, which might other
wise record the admitted damage to the win
ter wheat crop. Copper, among the metals
retained all its strength, speculative Interest
In copper consolidation being a BUstalniriM fea
ture, offsetting depressing effects on consump
tive demand of the recent advance. A special
feature of this week Is the activity in build
ing Wnd in real estate reported from a number
of widely separated sections, and lumber and
building materials generally are firm and tend
ing upward. Wool markets note a change In
the buyinc of some large 'lots of domestic
woola for speculation, and prices are llrm in
sympathy with advanced quotations paid for
some large lots of Australian " bonded wool
bought for re-export.
The strength of sugar shows no diminution
despite recent advances and further gains are
. to be noted, chiefly owing to good domestic
j demand and advancing European markets.

pretty much cleaned out by frosts.

to death, for this club was ;ss large around as the trunk of a great

was he. Instead of trying- to run away, which wouid have brought
him directly under the tumbling mass of jponwood; he crawled close
up to the door. The club had such force that the huge stone steps
below were ground to powder. The club was broken into many
piect-s. and one i i-.ve, living in the direction of the Prince, struck
him on his temples. Down dropped the Prince, without sign of life.
The air had crown suddenly dark to him. He was in the power of
the giant as he lay among the ruins of the castle's stone steps.
The giant listened long. Ah. ha!" he said at last, "I have
killed the saucy Prince, and it is a good day's work."
But still Abrarr.inidin was afraid of some trick. Three times he

by Abraminidin's war club as

"We are : gry. Let us out and we w ll be your watcl doe?.
We v Hi free your garden from all living things."
"Listen." said tht> giaiu. "'I have an enemy, who is even now
hiding in the gardens. He is a Fmall man, of whom'yoi need r.ot
be afraid. He la known as Prince l Don't Care. He is too srr.aii
for me to find- htm. Day and night he lays in wait by my castle and
I am unable to tell where he is now. He has done me much mis
chief. If you will capture him for me I will giv you your freedom
and will pay you well."
Such wonderful ears have we, great master." Bald the largest
of the dragons, "that we hear the smallest flower growing. Such
eyes have we that we can look Into the earth and Bee whatever is
hidden there. Such speed have we that there is no animal on earth
that can escape us, when once we are out of this pit. Anything that
makes the slightest sound, that is large enough to be seen, that runs
on the earth, is our prey. Let us out and, hide this Prince ever so
deep, be he evei so sly or run ever so fast, we will find him for y v."
"Well said." answered Abraminldin. rs he hurried off toward the
castle "I will bring the key that unlocks the gate to the pool whÂ»re
you have been prisoners so longr. Then be about your business, for
the Prince must not ape me again." '
The Prince had been taken to a cave by Bloodfilllkln. There- he
soon recovered his strength.
"Go out. Bloodfillikin," said the Prince, "and tell me what you
So Bloodfillikin went away and saw the giant .go to the pool
whore were the dragons and heard all that was said by the dragons
and by the giant. Back ran the faithful dog to the Prince.
"Hurry, dear Prinze, hurry: Get once more into the wolf skin
in which "you came into the castle garden. . The giant will free the
dragons and they will hunt f<->r you. 1 rhaps as a wolf you may
escape ;!;â¢:::." H**i , T
"Silly Bloodfillikin." answered the Prince, "to say that I may
escape. ' What is it that I cannot nquer with your help? So I
am to be hunted by the dragons. Well. I don't care."
The giant came to the pool of black water with his great key.
He placed the key in a rusty lock and turned it around with a queer
gratinÂ°- noise. Then he opened a" flood gate and the water began to
run out The dragons crowded to the gate to escape. With fierce
shrwkine the first 'of the dragons to reach the gate dashed through
the opening Seeing nothing but the giant to pat. the monster tried
to cat^h the siantf Abraminidin ran as he had ver run before.
Close behind him was the dragon, which went over the ground in
" Â£ TlWgiant strode fifty feet at one st*p. but he barely escaped.
\s he ?pran T into the castle and slammed the door behind him the
dragon's form struck agair.Pt the castle wall and jarred the. build
ing to its foundation.
Quick as were the dragons, the Prince was quicker.
'â¢So " he said. "1 am to fight a dragon and a giant. Very good.
I don't' care- but bear witness, BloodnTiikin. that I am not a fool. I
will fight all the draeons. but only one at a timeâ one dragon and
one giant at a time, if it may be necessary.' â .
The^e words followed closely upon some very rapid Movements
of the Prince When the giant Abraminidin tied from the flood
-ate in mortal fear of the dragons, the Prince, wrapped in the wolf
skin dashed boldly to the gate and shout* I to the dragons in a
iin^ua^e that they understood:
"Come not out "yet; the ground is bewitched outside of your pool..
While the monsters paused the water all ran out of the pool.
Then the Prince helped by the dog Bloodflllikin, managed to close
the flo.->d gate both throwing all their weight against it. A swift
movement and the gate was looked. In vain the dragons dashed
aSS "he gate: In vain they shrieked and asked to be freed: in
vain they "threatened to eat the Prince for the trick that he had
played upon them-which he could never have can out but for

he* went down to the ba-rn to see the
"wonders." '-â 
ThÂ°re was old Betsy s calf standing
in the barn door. "What a fine horse."
Tom Is soon on her back and awayâ
what direction? Answer: In every di
rection. Sometimes calf's heels were
soon sometimes boy's .heels; some
times calf's head, sometimes boy's
head Anyway, all of a sudden Tom
Hew through the air nnd landed on a
haystackâ not much hurt, but badly
frightened. .
' â¢â¢Well I wonder, sir." said Tom. s:t
ting up and bossy cow stood still and
looked Tom right In th<-- eye. It Beemed
very much as if she said. "I wonder,
sir." too. .
Pretty * soon Tom began to shout
â â Mamma." "Uncle Ned." "Mamma,
mamma." Ofide Ned had seen the
whole performance. â  He â  and Toms
mother came running.
"I don't care." said Tom, "I hate tnat
calf. If I had your gun 1 would
shoot It." >'â¢;., ; : ,_ . _
Tom whs carried to the house, and
couri plaster was used freely.
"I thought." said Tom when he was
seated by his mother. "I would have
a ride worth telling the boys of when I
bank, wh^rc you can sit and Singsfng all

ithi 1 stni ke and mad with rage is coming back
castle."
Bald the Prince, coolly, and not even looking ?ip from his
: . In which he was still searching. "Let him come; 1
yea; here is what I was looking for."
The dog looked curiously at this queer and very brave little
who was not afraid even when the ground began to shake un
der the weight of the aprroachiner draponâ who coolly stood his
ground and went ab"iu making S"m- % sort of a clever plan. The
giant Abraminidin had fled in fear of this very same monster.
"Gel up close to me. BloodnUikin,*' said the Prince, "for it will
be very warm here Boon."
The Prince had now in one hand a bottle and in his other hand
a framework of stee! wire, which he had suddenly shaped into a
circle larg- enough to surround him and the dog and leave a space
inside the circle still, around the edges. In the short time remain-
ing before the horri dragon, came into view the Prince had suc
ceeded in crossing the circle with steel wire bands The^e bands
were like a handle, which the Prince seized to hold up the steel
circle.
"What now, master?" asked the dog. ,
"Let me set Â° n your back - As; soon as the dragon passes the
drawbridge over the creek you, carrying m< on your back will run
straight toward him. Stop just-when I say and feave the remainder
of the battle to me."
"As you say. master." answered the dog, although It may be told
you that the dog had no taste for such an adventure. * *
Suddenly the dragon appeared on a hill beyond the cn?ek crush
ins: stones to powder beneath his mighty feet. .â . horrible monster
he was. lie. was ered from head -to tai! with shiny green scale?
He was something like a crocodile, only many times larger. His
four legs ended in feet that were armed with frightful claws' His
head was of great size. From his mouth came smoke and Bre and
a strange smell. His eyes were blood red. His teeth were as sharo
as swords and were as long as the tusks of the greatest of al! ele

had a bad ending. Tom was nut to

in mind an adventure with the billv

year? ago. "Eureka! " they shouted. "The
train is coming." Their escort, Pomeroy
Hamilton, came Wheeling in from Grand
Forks with a Winchester rifle and a
Waterbury watch brought from the At

isar.fi. After salutations he proposed ;i
Charlotte russe all around, but the two

French fay. Eau Claire (White Water),
and the bridegroom said he believed he
had Quincy and would take a Dover pow

All visited St. Joseph's church. Then

he, as a bachelor, offered to share his

row which has lasted nearly twenty
yeara. You will have belter prosperity
the latter portion of life.
JOHN J.. Chicoâ is the hand of a
htforward man, even in temper, not
ofraid of hard work. One marriage at 22!
which was not as happy as it might have
been. Two children.
C. LARK- This is the hand of energy,
enterprise and hard work, but like many
others has not reached the desired goal i
of wealth; much mechanical ability.
One ng voyage. The death of a relative j
turns the course of the life for a time.
MR. D. C. 11.. WoodlandâThis Is a vi
tally marked handâa man of strong sen
timents and determined purposes. He is
a man of good taste and refinement, fond
of the opposite sex. yet has not found un- :
alloyed happiness in his heart affairs. The
nature is changeable and restless, and In- ;
clined to 1kÂ» visionary. Would make a
good physician. A lawsuit and a serious
loss of money is shown in early life,
â¢which for a rime causes greal anxiety
and mental suffering. One great infatua
tion in the life not terminating fortu
lnately for the individual.
Under the Mistletoe sent in a print too
poor to read.
MRS ROSE McG., Santa Clara-
Hand shows widowhood. Yon are a fa
talist but noi religiously inclined. Very
conscientious and affectionate and intui
tive. . .. '
MRS E. M. W.. FitchburgâYour hand
shows v. rv early development, and that
you are domestic and very self-sacrific
ing The heart line Is predominant, show
ing that all ties of kinship and affection
will govern and rule. Yon will llnd a j
gr<mt deal of Ingratitude from your own
immediate family. An early marriage
and eventful life -ire sure to be your fate. j
You will mccl with a great deal of oppo
sition throughout your life. You begin
life in the East and .finish It in the West.
S. H. S.. SacramentoâLove and affection
very strong. Too much imagination will
lead you into trouble. Very sensitive and
quick in iction, thought, word and deed.
The hand of a gambler, speculator. Cau
tion and reason good; otherwise you
would at times consider suicide. You will
travel and are not of very domestic ten
dencies. Shov.ld be more consistent. â¢
WILLIAM ELDRED- You are bound to
be rich and will have a long life. You
have been a rover. Heart governs more
than head. You are always very Inde
pendent. You may have liver or stomach
troubles. Hope is one of your strong
points. :â¢,"'â¢ :\
MRS. ELDRED You have a very sen
sitive nature and are artistic. You are
very dependent on those around you nnd
re ol a strong domestic nature. You
have good common sense and are honest
and active Rnd very conscientious.
MISS R. E.âYou have a very artistic
hand nd have a great desire for travel.
You are good hearted and will meet with
people of distinction. .You are born to
command, not to obey. As a child you
must have been rather delicate. Har
mony ls the strongest point in all the
characteristics.
MRS. DORA DIBERTâLove and affec
tion are predominating qualities. Imagi
nation is strong and you are likely to
inherit money. Your health will be bet
ter In the future than in the past. You
have a very lucky hand.

Signor Vargas Singing Into Ten Phono
graphs at Once.
TOREADOR! Toreador!" rings out '
through the curiously arranged
workroom as the powerful voice
of Don Antonio Vargas renders the |
familiar but evcr-weleome song ,
from "Carmen." It is given loudly, i
much more loudly than you ever hear it
iat a theater or concert. Don Antonio x- I
pands his lungs to their utmost extent; I
; he has even taken off his tie and unbut- i
toned his collar so as to give his throat !
full play. The reason is that it is not an j
ordinary performance, for the benefit of j
! the public; it is a private seance specially j
arranged* for the edification of the Edison
phonograph. '
Don Antonio's audience is not composed :
of human beings; he is Blnging to eight !
little wax cylinders, portions of that in- |
animate wonder, the speaking machine j
created by Edison's genius. In front of
the artist, grouped closely together, are
eight tin receivers, each of which is at
tached to a phonograph. The machines
are all running simultaneously, so that
every time the Bong is sung eight separate
but identical records are made.
"This is how we make our master rec
ords," said Peter Bacigalupi, who pre
sides over the establishment. "It is a '
new and most profitable profession for
the singer. Vargas will go over that song
sixteen times to-day, and for each render
ing he gets a dollur. Pays well, doesn't
It? I have known one man who would 1
! sing fifty times a day, but that is a little
too much for any voice to stand."
The public, which carelessly walks into â 
a phonograph parlor and pays its nickel I
to hear a favorite selection, little suspects I
the amount of skill and expert handlinjr
required to produce these, lifelike records ;
Bacigalupi s salesroom and workshop, high i
up in the big building at 933 Market street

i Borne pictures which were being shown
lln my stero-photlcons. The pictures came
from Paris and have been shown all over
the States, so I never dreamt there was
anything wrong with them. But the
court said they were Improper. I have !
taken every one out and substituted
views of the strictest moral character,
ou can see for yourself, if you come
over to the parlor."
But the marvel of Bacigalupi's estab
lishment and the pride of his heart is the
giant Edison concert phonograph the !
only one which has been brought to* this
coast. The machine is a whole orches

sound which pours from the huge brass
trumpet. The. instrument is about the
size of a megaphone, the brass horn i 9

The wax cylinder on which the records
are made is five inches in diameterâ more
than twice the size of that used on the
old standard phonograph.
"It is the finest thing ever turned out
by the Edison workshop," says Baciga

The Chinese record heard from the I
mouth of the phonograph was not, of '
course, of much enHghtenmrtit to a Euro

the pecuiar Mongolian accents which were
ultimately to delight the residents of the ;
far-off Flowery Kingdom. "They make
thousands of records and pack thorn off
to China." adds Bacigalupi. "1 suppose ;
their friends and relatives can recognise
their voices, though I cannot see any
