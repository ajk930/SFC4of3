HOUSE OF WOOD
IN WHICH PEACE
CONGRESS MEETS
tV'HW YORK, April 14.â A Sun cable from London says: The Birmingham Post learns
-*â  that M. de Staal, Russian Embassador to Great Britain, has asked permission to resign the
presidency of the coming Peace Conference, but that the Czar has requested him to remain.
THE building in which the Czar's peace congress will assemble in The Hague, which is the capital of the
Netherlands, on May 18, is called "The House of Wood." and is one of the palaces of Queen Wilhelmina.
Its name in Dutch is -'Huis ten Bosch." The famous "orange room" has been selected as the apartment in
which the sittings of the congress will be held. It is a spacious room, and is illuminated by a glass dome
which spreads fifty feet above the floor. The palace of "the house of wood" was erected as long ago as 1647
by the Piincess de Solmi. who was the widow of Prince Henri of Orange. On the walls of its various rooms
hang paintings by Levens. Van Thulden and Jordaens. There are Chinese and Japanese rooms, furnished in
the pure style of these countries, and in which are collected the choicest specimens of Oriental art. This
old and beautiful palace was voluntarily proffered by the young Queen of Holland for the uses of the com
mission.
MAY PROVE
DREYFUS IS
INNOCENT
Italian Government's Secret
Information Did Not
Deal With Him.
ESTERHAZY THE MAN
All of the Evidence So Far Pub
lished Points Directly
to Him.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, April 13.â The Eclaire to-day
publishes the deposition made by M.
Trarieux, the former Minister of Jus
tice in the Ribaut Cabinet, before the
Court of Cassation in its inquiry into
the Dreyfus case. M. Trarieux said
that Count Torneilli-Brusatti Diver-
gano, the Italian Embassador to France,
declared to him in March, 1898, that
the Italian Secret Information Bureau
never had any relations with Dreyfus,
and that the publication of the bor
dereau and the document containing
the words "cette canaille de d " re
vealed to the Italian and German, at
taches that Dreyfus was the victim of
an error and that the bordereau was
communicated by another office]-.
Colonel Schwartzkoppen, Ihe German
military attache of the German' em
bassy at Paris, wrote to Colonel Paniz
zardi, the Italian military attache at
Paris, that he was not acquainted with
Dreyfus and attributed the bordereau
to Count Esterhazy. The Italian Em
bassador said Esterhazy went to Colonel
Schwartzkoppen in 1897 and asked for
protection, and on this being refused he
threatened to commit suicide. The
Italian Embassador added that the
document containing the words "cette
canaille de d " referred to a civilian
who had furnished Colonel Schwartz
koppen with plans and maps. The lat
ter was known to the foreign- attaches
under the name of "Dubois."
Finally the Italian Minister said he
was convinced after interviews wijh
.M. Hanotaux, the then Minister of
Foreign Affairs, that the communica
tion of Lieutenant Colonel Henry's for
gery in the Zola trial was made with
out the knowledge of the Government.
He also said that Esterhazy had rela
tions solely with Colonel Schwartz
koppen, who communicated to Colonel
Panlzzardi the documents which were
interesting to Italy.

THE FILIPINOS FLEE
BEFORE GEN. LAWTON
MANILA, April 13.â expedition
under Major General Lawton
yesterday moved twelve miles
further north along the lake,
taking two towns, Longos and
Paete. A squadron of the Fourth Cav
alry was left to garrison Santa Cruz.
There was only desultory shooting
from the retreating enemy until the
advance reached Paete, the center of
the insurgent's military government, in
the district of Laguna de Bad. Here the
road is Hanked by steep hills on each
side, oti which the insurgents had con
structed great log trenches, and there
were trenches also across the road.
The North Dakota regiment ran into
a cross fire and squads of five sharp
shooters each were sent up the steep
hills and through the thick brush to
flank the insurgents.
On" squad of .the North Dakota regi
ment suddenly came to the insurgent
trenches, halting when only fifteen
yards off. Only one man in this squad
got away unhurt.
The gunboats shelled the insurgent's
position for an hour. The enemy was
finally driven out. Our loss was five
killed and two wounded, the greatest
loss Lawton has yet sustained.
The launches captured Tuesday are.
worth $60,000. The expedition has not
sufficient men to leave garrisons in the
towns taken.
At about 4 o'clock this morning a
small body of rebels attacked the camp
of the Third Artillery from the swamp
near Paomboan, a mile and a half west
of Malolos. Two privates were killed
and a lieutenant and two others were
wounded. . â¢ ;jr
With the coming of daylight the
American forces scoured the district,
driving the rebels northward and kill
ing several of them. A private soldier
of the Montana regiment was wounded.
Francisco Reyes, the man who re
cently purchased the Spanish gunboats
at Zamboanga, island of Mindanao, has
received advices to the effect that the
fleet sailed for Manila and returned a
few days later with the vessels stripped
of their guns and ammunition. The
purchaser's agents and the native crews
for the vessels, on board the American
steamer Butuan, were convoyed to
Zamboanga by the United States cruis
er Boston and were instructed to await
for the arrival there of the United
States gunboat Petrel. Instead of do
ing so, after the Boston sailed for Zam
boanga, the Spaniards transferred their
gunboats to the agents of Senor Reyes
and the fleet left Zamboanga unescort
ed. It soon returned and reported hav
ing been looted by rebels, who removed
the gunboats' armament. If the in
structions of the American naval com
manders had been obeyed, their cap

He had eaten of this meat only once,

says:
"We view their present or future de

Be Paid With Troops.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, April 13.â Twelve gen
| erals and many other officers of the
I First and Second Army Corps of the
j Cuban forces met at Bayamo yesterday
and decided to name General Maximo
1 Gomez as the representative of the Cv
! ban army to the Americans, with full
power to treat for the army. There were
120 votes in favor of Gomez and 12
against him.
The Cuban generals this afternoon
I waited upon General Maximo Gomez
officially and informed him that they
desired him to represent the army in
j any negotiations with the United States
military authorities in Cuba. General
Gomez accepted the trust, after which
all waited upon Governor General
Brooke to discuss with him the details
of disarmament and payment.
General Gomez proposed that after
the work of disbanding was completed
the council of generals should be con
tinued under the presidency of General
Bartolc-me Masso as the head and front
of Cuban interests, a provisional Cuban
government assisting in promoting Cv
â  ban welfare under the control of the
Americans. In his opinion the Cuban
! officers, as well as the men of the rank
i and file, should receive a share of the
$3,000,000, especially as many of these,

His suggestion was that such officers

He declares the present course "re
pugnant to the fundamental principles
of this Government, a violation of the
declaration of independence, a repudi
ation of the theory upon which we en
gaged in the war with Spain and ut
terly inconsistent with your Excellen
cy's splendid announcement respecting
the policy to be pursued toward Cuba."
He says the people are "unable to
countenance the present attempt of
this Government to enforce title with
bayonets to a nation of brown men
purchased from a disgraced and van
quished despot and regard the further
sacrifice of our soldiers, in a conflict
waged against liberty and in the in

WASHINGTON, April President
McKinley to-day received a dispatch
from Dr. Schurman, president of the
Philippine Commission now at Manila.
This message says that the proclama

good and that Filipinos are visiting the
commissioners every day to express
their satisfaction and their desire to

ADMIRAL KAUTZ
TO BE SUSTAINED
BY THE PRESIDENT
â¢ The Pretender Mataafa, With His Sister and Hist
j . Council of Advisers. f
From a Photograph Taken in September, IS9B. T
NEW YORK, April 13.â
The Herald's Washington
correspondent sends the
following: Rear Admiral Kautz
has the entire approval of the
President for his action in dis
banding the government of Ma
taafa. in crowning Malietoa Tanu
and in his subsequent efforts to
establish peace and protect life
and property in Apia.
A cablegram to this effect was
sent to the Rear Admiral to-day,
and he was at the same time in
structed to maintain Malietoa
Tanu in power pending the ar
rival of the joint commission, and
to continue his efforts to main
tain order.
Baron Speck yon Sternberg, First
Secretary of the German embassy here,
called at the State Department to-day
and notified Secretary Hay of his ap
pointment as the German member of
the Joint Samoan Commission. The
President and Secretary Hay are
pleased with Germany's choice, as
Baron yon Sternberg is popular in dip
lomatic and official . circles, and with
him on the commission it is believed
that a satisfactory solution of the en
tire Samoan question can be reached. â¢
Great Britain has not yet entirely
! agreed to. the proposition of the Ger
man Government that the three com
missioners must be unanimous .upon all
points in dispute before action can r be
taken, she desiring that on certain
points the three Governments agree in'
advance to act upon the report of the
majority of the commission.
Germany has, moreover, not yet
abandoned the ' position she has as
sumed that before the commission shall
commence its work' the United States
and Great ' Britain agree to restore the
conditions which existed prior to the
installation of Malietoa Tanu as King.
These' matters are capable' of prompt
diplomatic adjustment, and the belief
of the administration that the German
Government will recede from its posi
tion is indicated by the instructions
sent to Rear Admiral Kautz.
.'< As told' to me' to-day these will be
the instructions' under which the com
mission will act:
: "The commission shall proceed to
Apia, where it will at once make an
examination of the situation.. The
Consuls will be continued in office and
directed to proceed with the adminis
tration of government affairs and : to
report to the commission any point
upon which they .fail to agree, the com
mission to take action thereon and the
naval commanders and consular offi
cers to carry out its decision.
"In the meantime each Consul will
make a separate investigation and will"
report his findings to his Government,
with such recommendations as he may
deem advisable, though the commis
sioners will report to the entire com
mission the discoveries made by each
and endeavor to unite upon recommen
dations as to the establishment of peace
and order, as to changes which should
be made in the consular representation
in Apia, and as to amendments to the
treaty in order to prevent a recurrence
of the conditions which have existed
since January 1."
An important point to be determined
upon the arrival of the commission is
as to the native to be selected to oc
cupy the throne. The United States
and. Great Britain are a unit in object
ing to the establishment of Mataafa
in power and Germany objects to
Malietoa Tanu. Germany, it is be
lieved, will appreciate the necessity of
withdrawing her support i from Mataa-
NEW YORK, April 13.â Sun
cable* from London says:
Whether Chief Justice Chambers
will receive instructions from
America in regard to the German
planter who is alleged to have
urged the Mataafans to fight is
a matter of doubt, as the Chief
Justice is already empowered by
the terms of the Berlin treaty to
shoot him if he is found guilty.
fa, who will undoubtedly be returned to
exile. It is the expectation that a
compromise will be reached by the
Commissioners and that a third
Samoan will be enthroned, possibly
Tamasese, who was elected Vice King:
with Malietoa Tanu. Fifteen years ago
Tamasese was liked by the Germans
and would probably not be objection
able now to Great Britain and the
United States.
As the plan to have the members
get away on the Mariposa, sailing on
the 19th, was no longer feasible, the
transport Badger, now at Callao. Peru,
on her way to San Francisco, was
placed at the disposal of the commis
sion.
It is possible, however, that a meet
ing may be held in Washington.
The killing of American and British
sailors will be one of the matters inves
tigated by the commission, it having
especially been brought to their atten
tion in the instructions already agreed
upon. It is confidently expected that
fighting will have ceased by the time
of the arrival of the commission at
Apia, but should it still be in progress
an ample force will be landed from. the
warships of the three powers, the Ma
taafans subdued and Mataafa placed
under arrest.
The German Commissioner, Baron
Sternberg, belongs to a distinguished
German family. He devoted his early
life to the study of military and naval
science. He fought through the Fran
co-Prussian war in the Second' Saxon
Dragoons, was promoted lieutenant at
the age of" 17 and was decorated for per
sonal bravery. He served as military
attache in Washington prior to enter
ing the diplomatic .service. He was
appointed secretary of the German le
gation at Peking, serving as charge
d'affaires during the important period
of the China-Japanese war. - Later he
was appointed charge at Belgrade. In
1897 he was appointed - counselor and
first secretary of the embassy in Wash
ington and has served here since then.
GERMANY SHOWS r
SIGNS OF WEAKENING
BERLIN, April 13.â The United
Wallaroo and Goldfinch, British Warships Ordered
to Samoa.
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
States embassy at noon to-day gave the
correspondent of the Associated Press
the following statement:
"We have received from the Foreign
Office an account of the latest conflict
in Samoa. The German Government
expressed sympathy and took occasion
to urge the adoption of the unanimity
rule in the findings of the Samoa com
mission in order that the German com
missioner, Baron Speck yon Sternberg,
might sail for Samoa at the earliest
moment possible. The German Gov
ernment urged that only the early ar
rival of the commission would prevent'
further serious bloodshed. This morn
ing Baron yon Bulo.w Informed the
American Embassador that Great Brit
ain has at last agreed to the unanimity
rule, the United States also agreeing
to it, and the commission can probably
proceed to the islands without delay."
The German press this morning gives
its news calmly and mostly without
comment. The Cologne Gazette re
marks: "We need not say that if the
guilt of the manager of the plantation
is proven Germany will approve of his
arrest and demand his punishment. We
will not defend the behavior of a Ger
man abroad merely because he is a
German."
The Cologne Gazette also admits that
Dr. Raffel, the German president of the
Municipal Council of Apia, acted ille
gally in closing the Chief Justice's of
fice, and says: "The other powers, we
also hope, will admit the illegal acts of
their representatives."
The Tageblatt calls the arrest of the
manager of the German plantation
where the ambuscade took place illegal,
saying: "Our Consul is the only com
petent judge."
The Lokal Anseiger expresses the
opinion that the affair shows the need
of prompt action by the commission.
The Vossische Zeitung says: "What
ever, action, the . German Government
takes, it will find itself fully backed up
by the Reichstag."
A number of leading papers, like the
Deutsche Zeitung, Schlesische Zeitung
and Hanover Courier, point out the ne
cessity of a larger navy. \y.:,y
The Reichstag interpellation on the
subject of Samoa is signed by a major
ity of the Center, Reichs party, Con
servatives and National Liberals, and
asks the Government for information
regarding "events in Samoa which have
injured German interests so seriously,"
and also requests information regarding
the measures taken or intended to be
taken by the Government under the
circumstances. The interpellation has
been allowed, and will be the main sub
ject for discussion in the Reichstag on
Friday.2
MATAAFA'S MEN ARE
CUNNING COWARDS
THE followers of Mataafa are not only |
cowards, but they are hard to hit. J.
W. Hyland, correspondent of the Lon
don Echo, Is authority for the state
ment, and he has had particularly good
opportunities for investigation. He was j
at Apia, part of the time at the now his- ;
toric Tivoli Hotel and part of the time I
on the United States cruiser Philadelphia, :
preceding and following the bombardment i
of the refractory natives by the com
bined fleets of America and England.
"The dusky beggars." he said, "lie on
' their bellies when they fire and then roll
away on the ground before you know it.
They will not stay still as ordinary light
ers, and the way they can shin up a tree
would do credit to a monkey."
Mr. Hyland, who is making an around
the-world tour for his paper, arrived at
Apia on March 16 on the steamer Taviuni :
from the Tonga Islands. With him were :
half a dozen Australian and English peo
ple, including A. S. Boyd, a staff artist
of the London Graphic. They took ac- I
commodations at the Tivoli Hotel on the
beach, and their first night in Samoa was
punctuated by bullets by both the rebel
natives and the English and American
marines. Death was probably at any hour,
and sleep was impossible. As it was, two
of the American marines who had gained ,
the hotel porch were killed by the weap
ons of Mataafa's men. That one night i
was enough for the tourists of .the Tavi
unl. The next . morning they went on
the various ships in the harbor, it falling j
to the lot of Mr. Hyland to go on the 1
Philadelphia, where, he says, he was
treated In the best possible manner, Lieu
tenant Lansdale, who was killed in the j
ambuscade reported In The Call dispatch j
of April 12, going so far as to give up his
cabin to the English correspondent.
"The first thing that happened of any
consequence," said Mr. Hyland yesterday,
"after our night In the Tivoli Hotel was
the order of Admiral Kautz to the Ger
man ship Falke to move out of the line
of fire. She was between the Philadelphia i
and the beach. The German captain
moved out without protestation, as far as
I could see. The American admiral at that
time, as far as I knew, intended to shell
the German places of refuge of the Ma
taafa men. the Tivoli Hotel included.- The
Tivoli was known to be a nest of the \
Mataafa people, and it was undermined
by order of the American admiral, ready
to be knocked down at any time.
"The most beautiful thing in the whole
affair to my mind," said Mr. Hyland,
"is the concert of action between the i
Americans and British. Before we left
Apia the refugees used to go for strolls
along the beach, which was patrolled by
marines from the American and British
warships, ten feet apart, for the entire
distance. We kept away from the woods
and such possible ambuscades as I see I
by The Call dispatches the poor marines
fell into. Another thing in the wav of
harmony between the English-speaking
navies was shown by the action of the
Porpoise before we left. For several days
fhe would go out in the morning for a
cruise along the shores and at night i
would come in, Invariably with seven or
eight captured canoes and their native
occupants. As soon as she cast anchor :
Captain Sturdee would make a call on
Admiral Kautz and have a social glass."
Mr. Hyland is of the opinion that the j
action of German Consul Rose throughout
the whole matter has beep actuated by
the fact that his wife is a half-caste
woman. The Echo correspondent left
Samoa on the Mariposa on March 2(5, and
while matters were in as serious a con
dition as he describes, he had no idea that
there was any possibility of affairs taking I
on any such serious aspect as reported in .
The Call of Wednesday. He leaves this
evening for theY'osemite, and upon his re
turn from that place will start for the
East and the Paris Exposition.
MISHAP THAT COST
LANSDALE'S LIFE
In the cabled reports received by The
Call of the recent disastrous engagement
at Apia it was stated that Lieutenant
Lansdale and his comrades met their
death through the jamming of the Colt's
automatic gun at a critical moment The
little body of a hundred English and
American bluejackets was ambuscaded
on Yailele, one of the German planta
tions, by an immensely superior force of
Samoans, and just at the time when ma
chine-gun fire, judiciously applied, would
have saved the party the Coll automatic
gun Is stated to have hopelessly jammed.
Lieutenant Lansdale lost his life while
trying to get the gun Into action again.
Freeman of the Tauranga and several
marines were killed at the same time.
I. R. B. Grubb, who is the Pacific Coast
agent for the Colt Patent Firearms Man
ufacturing Company, is utterly at a loss
to account for the occurrence.
"l cannot believe," he said yesterday,
"that a Colt automatic gun could behave
In this way. Why, the weapon was sub
jected to the most exhaustive series .if
tests before being adopted by the Navy
Â©apartment. The pun has Seen used with
great effect in Cut. a and Porto Rico, as
well as in the Philippines, and no case
of Its jamming has ever been reported be
fore. You will notice, too, that in the
official report of the engagement nothing
is said about the misbehavior of the
weapon. Therefore I should prefer to
wait until the naval officers engaged
make a detailed statement before' admit
ting the possibility of such a mischance."
The Colt automatic gun in question is
universally recognized as the most ad
vanced instrument of modern murderous
warfare. Designed solely for military
purposes, it is In many ways an im
provement on the English Maxim, which
recently wrought such terrible havoc on
the Dervish forces in the Soudan. -It Is
constructed to use any kind of rifle am
munition, and the force of the recoil is
utilized to keep the gun working. Thus
all the gunner in charge has to do is to
hold his hand on the trigger and the gun
will pour out a stream of lead in any de
sired direction. To prevent heating the
barrel is made of extra thick metals, and
the cartridges are fed by means of an
endless baud. It is easy, as long as am
munition lasts, to fire a hundred w. .1
aimed rounds a minute with this weapon,
ami doubtless had the gun been brought
into effective action the bush could have
been cleared of Samoans before they
found i.me to seriously assault the An
glo-American forces.
The cartridge used in this weapon la
similar in shape to that of the Mauser,
or Lee-Metford rifles. The only differ
ence Is that the caliber is 6 instead of 7
millimeters. The bullet is of lead encased
With steel, and the. shell is made of thick
solid drawn brass.
"It would be impossible for one of these
shells to . burst , aud jam the gun," ex
claimed Grubb, as he lovingly . han
dled the dangerous little plaything. "I
cannot believe such a thing could hap
pen."
NEW ZEALAND IS
ANXIOUS TO FIGHT
LONDON, April 13.â The Premier of
New Zealand, the Right Hon. R. G.
W. HYLAND, CORRESPONDENT OF THE LONDON ECHO,
Seddon, has cabled to the Agent Gen
eral of New Zealand here, the Hon. W.
P. Reeves, saying:
"We deeply regret the adversity which
has overtaken our forces in Samoa.
Inform the Secretary of State that New
! Zealand will do anything possible to
render assistance in the emergency
; which has arisen. Our steamer is

I uty Governor has communicated to the
Admiralty at Sydney that the Mildora,
â  a British third-class cruiser detailed for
the protection of floating trade in Aus
-1 tralasian waters, is on her way to
! Raratonga with the Governor."
The comment of the afternoon news
papers on the Samoan situation is
mostly a repetition of the remarks
made in the editorial columns of the
morning papers.
The Globe declares that the mainte
nance of the German Consul at his post
is an act of apparent unfriendliness
which requires to be explained.

NEW YORK. April 13.â The follow

by a gentleman in New York from an
American friend at Apia, Samoa, which
was written on March 23:
"It Is rot Improbable that Mataafa's '

MRS. KAUTZ VERY
ANXIOUS ABOUT SAMOA
LOS ANGELES, April 13. â Mrs.
Kautz, wife of the admiral whom the
Samoan trouble has brought into prom
inence, and Mrs. Miller, wife of Ad
miral Kautz' flag lieutenant, are in
Los Angeles. They have been at Coro
nado Beach since the admiral's flagship,
the Philadelphia, sailed from San Diego
in February. The last letters the ladies
had from their husbands were on Sun
day, and these reported that all looked
quiet and hopeful. Having heard no dis
turbing reports before leaving San
Diego yesterday it was a shock to both
to learn on their arrival here that af
fairs had taken so serious a turn and
that there had been bloodshed.
Mrs. Kautz and Mrs. Miller, who vis
ited the newspaper offices this morning
to read the latest dispatches, were both
nervously eager for news from the far
away Islands.
"I know poor Mrs. Lansdale well,"
said Mrs. Kautz, in a voice broken with
sympathy. "We are so vitally inter
ested in every word, and it is so hard
to wait for dispatches which must be
! carried by ship."
They passed a portion of the day at
| Santa Monica and Pasadena and will
leave on this evening's train for San
Francisco, where they will remain in-
finitely.

MERCHANTS
OF SAMOA IN
BAD STRAITS
Business Is at a. Standstill
in the Vicinity of
Apia.
ONE SEEKS SAFETY
While on the Philadelphia His
Stock Has Been Stolen and
Plantation Plundered.
The sudden outbreak of war in Samoa,
with its attendant destruction of life and
property, has caused considerable anxiety
in mercantile circles in this city. There
are quite a number of firms interested in
the Samoan trade, sending regular sup
plies of goods to the islands, or importing
copra and other native produce. Last
Friday, when the Mariposa, arrived, the
lamentable state of trade on Apia Beach
was made manifest by the lack of corre
spondence. Instead of substantial orders
for large stocks "of trade there were but
few letters, and those of a kind indicating
the utmost despair.
John Wightman Jr., who acts as the
Pacific Coast agent for the leading Apia
storekeeper, W. Blacklock, reports that
he received but a few despairing lines
from his client tins mail, pointing out that
under existing conditions it would be im
possible to give further orders for goods.
TBlacklock is the moving spirit of the
American colony in Apia and for many
years acted as Vice Consul.
The wealthiest American citizen in Apia
is D. S. Parker, who is a familiar figure
in San Francisco. Years ago Parker had
the good fortune to Invest his savings, ac
cumulated by island trade, in San Fran
cisco real estate. These investments were
made so Judiciously that now Parker is
the lucky owner of much revenue produc
ing property in this city, and is compara
tively independent of the fluctuations of
native trade. Yet even he despairs, as
his last letter to Hooper, Jennings & Co.,
his agents here, shows. Parker owns a
large estate just outside Apia, on which
he has built several fine residences, one
of which was occupied, until the recent
outbreak, by Judge Chambers, the Ameri
can Chief Justice of the Samoan Supreme
Court. Judge Chambers has long ago
been compelled to flee to the United States
war vessel for protection, and so has poor
Parker, as his letter tells. He writes
from Apia on the 23d of March just a
week before the lamentable conflict in
which Lieutenants Lansdale of the Phila
delphia and Freeman of the Tauranga
lost their lives and heads.
After referring to some business mat
ters, he writes: "There are terrible times
here, and business is completely stopped
owing to the war. The American and
English vessels are shelling the rebels,
and nearly all the foreigners, with their
families, are on board the war vessels.
Myself and family are on board the Phila
delphia. We nave lived there for several
days past, and do not know how long we
will have to remain. My farm, about two
miles from the harbor, where I have 100
acres of land and four houses, is at the
mercy of the rebels. My house has been
looted, horses, cattle and pigs) all killed,
and I expect my other houses will be
burned. Very likely my store on the
beach will go also. At the best I will be
a great loser. American and English sail
ors are ashore protecting the town, while
the warships are continually throwing
shells inland. The English have lost three
killed, the Americans one, besides some
wounded.
"King Malietoa was crowned to-day,
and saluted by the Americans and En-,
glish. I hope to hear some good news by
to-morrow's mail steamer. The Germans
are keeping neutral. They have been the
whole cause of the trouble, but I think
they have seen their day. Apia is under
martial law; one cannot go ten yards
without a permit. I am not sending for
anything this mail. Please send me pa
pers with Samoan news."
The last sentence is indicative of poor
Parker's state of isolation. He is unable
to order any more goods for his store,
and actually appeals to his San Francisco
agents for news concerning Samoan af
fairs.
Messrs. Healy. Tibbltts â Co., the con
tractors for the Pago Pago coaling. sta
tion on Tutulla, are also considerably
concerned about the recent outbreak.
They fail to see how they can carry out
the work of building the coaling station
and wharf peacefully and profitably if
they are to be subject to constant at
tacks by savage natives. The firm did
not take the contract with the expecta
tion of having to wage a small war on its
own account, and it Is looking to
Washington for protection. It was stated
that the armed collier Sclndia, which
came around the Horn with the lowa,
was to be sent at once to Apia. Still It is
doubtful whether she can be made ready
for sea in less than a month, and the
Brutus may possibly be dispatched to
Tutulla instead. Meanwhile Healy, Tib
bltts & Co. have commenced loading tho
Cardigan Castle, a British iron ship, with
stores and construction material. She
should be ready to sail for Pago Pago by
the end of the month and the firm is nat
urally anxious to insure protection for
this valuable cargo. The Secretary of the
Navy has had its view of the .case -fully
placed before him, and a definite an
nouncement is dally expected from Wash
ington.

VIRTUALLY MEANS
A CONFISCATION
Objection to Improving
Into Debt.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
FRESNO. April 13.â A sensational in
junction suit was to-day brought in the
Superior Court against the City Trus
tees by property-owners on Tulare
street, between M and N, to stay the
attempt to confiscate the property by
improving it into debt.
The suit is brought by Charles C.
Chance, a minor (by Mary Chance, his
guardian), Margaret Smith, J. D. Dem
ing, H. V. Deming and E. O. Deming
against Joseph Spinney, C. J. Craycroft,
W. M. McVey, F. M. Chittenden and E.
L. Austin, as Trustees of the City of
Fresno.
The order to pave the street was
made by the board about three weeks
ago in spite of the protest of the prop
erty-owners. The cost of improving
the street would be over half the value
of the property facing upon it and
would amount practically to a confisca
tion of the property. The complaint
makes pretty warm reading, not min
cing words, and declares "that these
plaintiffs are now informed and be
lieve that on the 20th day of Febru
ary, 1899, the defendants conspired,
combined and confederated with one J.
H. Bingham, who was the agent of the
City Improvement Company, to cause
the street to be paved with bituminous
rock and curbed with granite or con
crete curbs at the expense of the own
ers of the property fronting on the
thoroughfare, and combined, conspired
and confederated with each other and
with Bingham and the officers and
agents of the company to give the con
tract for doing the work to the City
Street. Improvement Company."
The complaint further alleges that at
the time of making the order the Trus
tees knew the public interest did not
require the paving of the street and
that they ordered the work solely for
the purpose of awarding the contract to
the City Street Improvement Company.
In support of the last statement it is
pointed out that in order that the City
Street Improvement Company might
get the contract the board willfully re
fused to require the City Engineer to
furnish any estimates whatever.
Judge Webb issued an injunction as
prayed for in the complaint. The plaint
iffs furnished a bond in the sum of $500
as required by law with A. D. Chance
and Herman Peterson as sureties.
The Trustees meet to-morrow night,
and it was the intention to award the
contract at that time. Should they do
so now they would be in contempt of
court. Much indignation has been
aroused against the present Board of
Trustees as a result of their action, and
open charges of jobbery have been
made. All the contracts awarded up to
this time have been given to the City
Street Improvement Company.

"HONORABLE" BILL
CODY TESTIFIES
Witness for Mrs. How
ard Gould.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 13.-Colonel Wil
liam F. Cody, sworn as the "Honor
able," gave his testimony to-day be
fore a referee in the case of Miss Kath
erine Clemmons, â¢ now Mrs. Howard
Gould, against the World for $100,000
damages. In the article of which she
complained, the plaintiff was spoken
of as the ward of "Buffalo Bill." whom
she had deserted and left to languish
in illness and sorrow. The well-known
scout was pictured at the time as re-,
clining upon a couch, with his eyes
rolled up and his brow crossed and
recrossed by numerous corrugations.
There was no sign of either illness
or sorrow when Colonel Cody appeared
this morning in the office of Edward
la Fetra. Colonel Cody testified that
he had been presented to Miss Kath
erine Clemmons in London in 18S7. He
explained that he was then making a
tour of Europe with his Wild West
show. Miss Clemmons was at that
time appearing in a play entitled "The
White Lily." Colonel Cody said he was
not interested in the play, but that
subsequently he undertook to obtain
for Miss Clemmons the rights for the
dramatization of H. Rider Haggard's
novel. "She."
"After that," said the witness. "I ad
vanced money for the presentation of
a play called 'The Lady of Venice. '
which was produced in this country. I
paid for the scenery and costumes.
Miss Clemmons was then in my em
ploy. She was under salary."
The colonel was as':ed concerning his
illness in the West at the time of the
publication of the alleged libel. He ad
mitted that he had been illâ for one
day. He had a cold, and was obliged to
remain in his room for that period.
There were few questions asked and
the inquiry was hurried along.
It is expected that the case will be
taken up in fourteen or fifteen months,
judging by the present state of the
Supreme Court calendar. â¢
Mrs. Gould was not present. The
hearing was attended only by the at
torneys of those interested.

â Â»TE\V YORK, April 13.â The dinner
\ of the Democratic Club in honor
NYORK, April of the birth of
ratlc < ;iuh in honor
nniversary of the birth of
* Thomas Jefferson was held to
. night at the Metropolitan Opera
bouse. Looking from the tiers to the floor
of the vast dining hall the tables seemed
like great beds of roses. The thirty-two
tables were on either side of the speakers'
table. Each table was piled with a mass
of roses and ferns Intertwined, So abun
dant were the flowers that some of the
guests were hardly able to see one another
over the floral banks. Swans and vases
of alabaster held flowers; there were
cornucopias or horns of plenty tilled with
flowers and fruit and the scene was set
off with ribbons of cardinal silk.
The floor of the auditorium was raised
to a level with the half stage by a tem
porary floor, making a rectangular room
of Immense size. The tables were set in
rows parallel with Thirty-ninth and For
tieth streets. The guests of nor 'were
at two tables si i under the proscenium
arch and at right angles to the other
tables. The stage was set with a gorgeous
palace scene of the court of Louis XIV.
Four great electric chandeliers lighted
up the picture.
Conspicuously placed at the west end
of the dining hall was the inscription:^
"Jeffersonâ l743-1899â Democratic Club."
This was composed of incandescent
lights. It surrounded a picture of Thomas
Jefferson. Tall silver candelabra with
shades harmonizing with the floral effect
were on all the tables.
The guests began to arrive at 6 o'clock,
but the dinner did not begin for an hour
und a half after that. Captain Price of
the tenderloin and forty-two policemen
Were In and around the building. A cor
don of bicycle policemen surrounded the
house. Al crunk letter of a few days
ago, in which a threat was made to blow
up the building during the dinner, seemed
to have made the police unusually vigi
lant. A number of detectives in evening
dress mingled with the guests so that no
unbidden poison might enter. There were
v. number of firemen on guard to prevent
any danger from Are.
Inside the building was an army of ush
ers and attendants. These wore a drab
uniform with silver buttons. Just before
the guests were called to order Richard
Croker. Perry Belmont, Commissioner
Scanned and Senator Sexton entered a
box. Mr. Croker was in enthusiastic con
versation with those about him and waved
his hands to guests all over the hall.
There were fully 300 mora guests than
the 1000 planned for, but all found seats.
This is said to be the largest number ever
accommodated at a banquet in the his
tory ot the city. The great dinner to
President McKinley at the Waldorf-As
toria was served to only 900.
The band struck up "Hail to the Chief"
at 7:30 o'clock, and Richard Croker. arm
in arm with John Stanchfleld, marched
down the aisle. With them were Fred
erick C. Shraub, Robert B. Roosevelt,
General J. Catlin and Amos H. Cum
in Inge.
The service of the menu was excellent,
but some confusion was caused by some
of the diners stripping the tables of flow
ers nd ribbons and throwing them to
the women in the boxes. Mr. Croker
held a levee just before the regular
.making began. Mr. Croker snook
hands cordially with everybody and
smiled as man after man congratulated
him upon the success of the dinner.
The confusion was very great. As the
time drew near for the making of
speeches the orators were almost discour
aged at the prospect of making them
selves heard.
Perry Belmont began 'to speak at 10
o'clock. The uproar was so great that
he could not be heard a hundred feet
away. By degrees more quiet was 'ob
tained. Mr. Belmont said In part:
This is not the place or time to relate. in de
tail the history of the negotiations by Jeffer
son with Napuleoti, beginning in that month of
ISO 2 when a Spanish officer at .New Orleans
revoked the license granted hy the treaty with
Spain of 1795 to deposit American products at
that port and freely ship them thence iÂ« -he
West Indies and Europe, and ending ot; that
last day in April in the next year, when t.._
treaty was signed.
Attempts to impair the title of Jefferson to
the h-jnor of the American part of that suc
cessful diplomacy have been failures. The
plan was Jefferson's; the execution of the plan
was his. While he baffled the Federalists, en
deavoring to push him into a war with France,
he conciliated the western States, exas
perated- because deprived of an outlet to the
gulf. Ills official instructions to Livingitone
and Monroe, his private letters to each, pub
lished not long ago, disclose one controlling
head on the American side. Recent revelations
also show that Jefferson exploited in a most
effective way the hopes and fears which I '11
--trolled the conduct of the great First Consul.
It is not easy for history to separate the
-'resident of the United States from the credit
or discredit of the chief acts of an adminis
tration. So it is with Jefferson and the Louisi
ana purchase: with Madison and the war of
1S12; with Polk and the war of 1848; with Lin
coln ... I the war of secession; with Cr.i it and.
the Alabama treaty. So it will be w'th Mc-
Kinley and the war with Spain. Praise or
blame for what was demanded at Paris will
be his. If the President has the benefit of suc
cess he should bear the burden of allure.
The recent treaty with Spain has been rati
fied. It is now a fixed fact In our law and our
politics. It declares that "the civil rights and
political status of the native inhabitants there
in ceded to the United States shall be deter
mined by the Congress."
The discretion and decision are legislative
and not executive. The President's war power
growing nut of the war with Spain Is at an
end If he does not assemble Congress to do
what Die treaty ordained, and the public wel
fare shall thereby suffer, the responsibility will
be his.
We all asree that the Democratic party
should have for its cornerstone the doctrines
Indicated by Jefferson. One was "the suprem
acy of the civil over the military authority."
but that does not require a national Demo
cratic convention to prescribe to Congress the
size of a standing army. Another was "hon
est friendship with all nations, entagllng alli
ances with none," but that would not justify
a national Democratic convention indicating to
a Democratic President the details of his
diplomacy to preserve such friendship and
avoid such ulliances. A third was "honest
payment of our debts, sacred preservation of
the public faith, encouragement of agriculture
and commerce." but. that does not compel a
Democratic national convention to endeavor to
prevent Democrats in any Congressional dis
trict from expressing their preference regard
ing the details which will best enforce the doc
trine. 'â¢'--
It will be said that Jefferson was a man of
peace. So was the Democracy he founded a
party of peace, excepting when war becomes
necessary, as it did a year ago. Then Demo
crats in Congress and in the field upheld the
flag of our country with their votes and with
their lives.
Mr. Belmont introduced Augustus Van
Wyck by .erring to the latter's can
vass for' Governor. He .said Justice Van
Wyck bad conducted a campaign /with
honor to himself and credit to the De
mocracy. Justice Van Wyck was greeted
with great applause. After referring to
the many evidences of superiority of skill
and genius of the American people and
inveighing against the tariff, Judge Van
Wyck said:
This pressure of English competition along
the entire northern boundary of our country
at the very time when it has become so fash
ionable for a certain class of political leaders
and after-dinner speakers to thoughtlessly ad
vocate ._ political and commercial alliance, of
fensive and defensive, between these two
countries, It will not be deemed amiss to cau
tion our people against hasty action. Let us
lie Influenced by the natural as well as the
fixed policy of that nation toward us for a
century and a half, rather than by their pro
fuse expression of friendship during the Span
ish war.
The policy of England, he said, has always
been one of sharp rivalry and competition with
America: it Impelled the revolution of 1776,
fought for business as well as political In
dependence; brought on the war of ISI2, waged
ngalnst the Insolent claim of England for the
right to search our (hips Of commerce while
riding the highways of the ocean; caused her
to contest very Inch of our northern boundary
line irom ocean to ocean: made her encourage
our family troubles In I*6l to 1865. for which
j- 1lÂ»- was compelled to pay us millions and ad
â "it her wrong; and actuated her In violation
of the Monroe doctrine to attempt an unwar
rantable encroachment upon the territory of
Venezuela until ordered by the American
Government to halt, notwithstanding that our
new Embassador at the court of St. James
seemed to think that his first duty was to
apologize to the English people therefor; and
she has paralleled our inland waterways and
railroads from ocean to ocean, separating us
from our Alaskan possessions. She la now and
will ever be our principal competitor In the
commerce of the world. Under such circum
stances it would be her greatest boast In
diplomacy to engender the animosity of the
other nations of the world toward us by such
an alliance. For then, ln case the emergency
should ever arise that our country should feel
it necessary to command her to halt again in
any of her future aggressions and she should
refuse, the I'nited States would find herself
without a friend in the sisterhood of nations.
A lively appreciation of the true hearings of
both nations will lie the surest guaran.ee of
lasting friendship and peace between them.
At the conclusion of Justice Van "Wyck's
speech many persons left the hall.
John K. Stanchtield. responding to
"Thomas Jefferson." had much difficulty
In making himself heard.
MILWAUKEE OBSERVES
JEFFERSON DAY
The Features of a Big Banquet Are
Speeches by Bryan and Car
ter Harrison.
MILWAUKEE, April 13.â Jefferson
Club of Milwaukee observed the day in a
most fitting manner by a banquet at the
Planklnton House to-night, which was at
tended by over 400 guests. Colonel W. J.
Bryan of Nebraska was the guest of honor
and delivered the principal address. Del
egations of Democrats were in attendance
from many towns throughout the Stat.'
and nearly all the Democrats from the
State Legislature were present. Colonel
Bryan was escorted on an early train
from Chicago by a large delegation from
that city, and Mayor Harrison came later,
also with a large number of escorts.
The banquet hall was beautifully dec
orated with the national colors. Bryan
spoke on "Democracy." He said in part:
We are now near' enough to the next cam
paign to be able to form some Idea of the
lines along which the contest will be fought
and I am taking no risk when 1 say that those
who In I>W gave their allegiance to the Chicago
platform are united to-day in the determina
tion that no steps taken In '96 shall be re
traced. The platform applied to the conditions
then existing, the principles which had been
Democratic In the beginning of the govern
ment. Suggestions that we abandon the money
question sometimes come from those who de
serted the party in '96. but those suggestions
are not supported by evidence tending to show
that the organization in '96 was wrong, but
are predicated upon the theory that the Issue
upon which the party once lost can never be
revived, and what seems most strange, this
argument is made by those who have followed
a different course In the past.
In IKB Mr. Cleveland was defeated on the
tariff issue, and yet the tariff was made the
main issue in ly_ and Mr. Cleveland was elect
ed. Mr. Harrison wes defeated largely on ac
count of the McKinley bill, and four years
later the author of the bill was nominated on
a platform reaffirming the belief In protec
tion and was successful. Thus it is seen that
in two instances recently a losing issue ln one
campaign became a winning issue in the cam
paign following.
The test ought to be not whether the issue
has been presented before, but whether the po
sition taken is right. If the gold standard was
unmet. in 1596 It Is unmerited now. If Its
maintenance was a detriment to the Interests
of the people of this untrv then it is a detri
ment now. If In 1896 It was so hurtful that
the Republicans promised to put forth their
best effort to substitute international bimetal
lism for it and after the election was still -J
hurtful that the .-"resident sent a commission
to Europe to secure foreign aid in abandoning
it. what has happened since then to ma . the
American people accept it as a blessing.
If Increased discovery of gold In AlaÂ»ka had
been of any advantage to the United States,
It. is bat another evidence that the quantita
tive theory of money is correct. If a large bal
ance of trade in favor of the United States
gives any relief because of the money thus
brought into the country, it is an additional
argument In favor of the quantitative theory
of money. Blmetallists have contended that
times will be made better by the return of the
double standard and by the increased supply
of standard money thus furnished for the busi
ness of the country.
While it is unnecessary to discuss the ques
tion of ratio until some other ratio Is proposed
it may not be out of place to suggest that 16
to 1 being the ratio at which the present gold
and silver coin circulate, it is the natural ratio
at which the mints should be reopened. To
Increase the ratio by increasing the size of
the dollar would necessitate the recolnage of
our present silver dollars into a less number of
dollars and the increase of the ratio made
throughout the world would result in a large
decrease in the volume of standard money, and
since the value of a dollar depends on the
number of dollars such a change would neces
sarily Increase the purchasing power of a dol
lar and increase the burden of debts. It
would be equivalent to a transfer by legisla
tion of a vast amount of wealtn from the pro
ducing classes to the money owning classes.
The attempt of the Republican party to re
tire the greenbacks and substitute for them
national notes will give to that question a
greater prominence than it enjoyed in 15.6.
During the war the national bank note never
became more valuable than the greenback, be
cause it war, redeemable In the greenback. The
national bank note is good only because the
National Government stands as an indorser of
the bank. Ii the value of the hank note is de
pendent upon the Government, how can it be
any iter than the Government's own paper,
and why should the Government give ninety
banks a bonus to induce them to issue bank
notes which are in no respect superior and in
some respects inferior to the greenbacks issued
by the Government and for which the people
pay no bonus?
The trusts are now absorbing an Increasing
share of public attention because of their rapid
growth during the last two years. We had a
sugar trust and an oil trust some years ago.
We now have a biscuit trust and a match
trust and a meat trustâ in fact a trust in al
most everything that is used. The milk trust
reaches the intant as he enters the world, the
ice trust cools him in the summer, the coal
trust keeps him warm in the winter, while the
coffin trust wafts to receive him when life's
fitful dream is over. The people are beginning
to see what the principle of monopoly really
means, and yet the principle nt monopoly, so
plainly illustrated by the industrial trusts,
does not differ at all from the principle of
monopoly which underlies both the gold stand
ard and the paper money trust.
The Democratic party is prepared to face the
future and meet new issues without abandon
ing the old.
Ex-Senator John L. Mitchell of Wiscon
sin, whose theme was "Thomas Jeffer
son," devoted his entire address to a
eulogy "i" the founder of Democracy.
John F. Doherty of La Crosse answered
to the sentiment, "The Young Democra
cy"; Thomas L. Chary of Palnevllle on
"Party Honesty Is Party Duty." Carter
11. Harrison of Chicago responded to
"Corruption In Polities." saying in part:
It lies in the power of the young Democracy
of the nation if it will but set to work In the
first trenches to carry forward the crusade of
purity In politics until corruption shall have
been driven from high places, until honesty
(shall control In every department of the mu
nicipal, the State and the national Gtobern
nlclpal. the State and the national Govern
look far for an incentive. The example is set
for it in the person of our national leader. Two
years ago the party made Its tight under a
leader from private life so stainless, with per
sonal character so blameless that the people
followed him and follow him still with such
zeal as the Crusaders displayed In the paladins
of old. , _, , ' * '
â Ours is the party of the people, "unless we
serve the people honestly and fairly we are
faithless to our trust. Duty requires us to

Democracy will not tolerate a man, no matter
how profuse his professed devotion to the party
creed, who does not place his obligation to the
public above any and every personal consid

means the honest service of the people. No
man can be a Democrat whose integrity is not
above suspicion. He who seeks public office
for private gain is a traitor to everything for
which Democracy stands, and for him there
should be no place within the party ranks It
should be the duty of every true Democrat to

BUNKO MEN ROB A

SELL HIM A SACK OF WHITE
SAND FOR SUGAR.
Joseph Sweetman Cleverly Swindled

Police Notified.
J. Sweetman, who conducts a restaurant
at 812 Sixth street, is the victim of two
clever bunko men.
Last Wednesday afternoon two men
drove up to his place of business and of
fered for sale a 100-pound sack of "sugar"
for $4. To show him that the contents of
the sack was as they represented one of
the men cut a hole in the middle of it and
took out a handful of sugar. After
sampling it Sweetman, convinced that the
"sugar" was of .good quality, readily gave
them the amount they asked for It.
After they had been gone some time
Sweetman cut open the sack and was
astonished to find that it contained white
sand, with the exception of a small bag
of sugar from which the clever thieves
took the sample which they had shown to
their unsuspecting victim. Sweetmun lost
no time in visiting police headquarters,
where he told the story of how he had
been duped to Captain' Bohen. He de
scribes one of the men as being rather
tall, of slim build, clean shaven and wear
ing a stiff hat. The confederate was of
medium size and walked with a limp. He
was also clean shaven and was shabbily
dressed. The men represented that they
were peddlers and had bought the "sugar"'
at a sacrifice.

Customs Collector Jackson emphatically
denies the truth of a story printed in a
morning paper yesterday in which the
following statement was made:
Baron J. H. yon Schroeder Is at outs with
Uncle Sam. it is all on account of one linen
shirt, valued at about S3. The shirt has been
lost in course of handling by custom officials.
The owner demands the return of Ills prop
erty forthwith. His demand has been urged
with all the vigor of a man who feels that
he has a just grievance against Uncle Sam
in general and the San Francisco Custom
house in particular.
The Collector says that the shirt was
not lost at all, and that when ft arrived
from New York it was given to the
Baron's broker, which was about a week
ago. The shirt had been sent to New
York to be examined by the Board of
General Appraisers in the matter of an
appeal from the appraisement made at
this port. When the appraisers got
through with it they sent it back to Col

The train from the East carrying the
delegates to the congress was the largest
special on record arriving in San Diego.
This great gathering of international
representatives will be unique in char
acter. While American in heart and
spirit, it will not be bound by any limi
tations of race or nationality. Here will
be assembled men and women Inspired
by the sublime idea of bringing into act
ual realization a universal brotherhood of
humanity. The various exercises will rep
resent every department of the brother
hood, which includes every aspect of
thought and lifeâ the work of philan
thropy, the world of literature, art and
the drama and everything which tends
to uplift humanity to a higher life. Cali
fornia, land of flowers and sunshine, Is
pre-eminently the State for such a mag
nificent epoch-making assembly, repre
senting as it does the forward spirit in
science, education, art and philosophy.
Point Loma is an ideal spot to estab
lish everything that -forwards perfect hu
man life, outstripping all purely material
achievement. Here will be seen in time
in flowing operation everything which
makes man's life great and noble; here
shall be found America's temple at Olym
pla. No pandering to the many cranklsms
of the age shall here be found, no dab
bling in BOOOkology, no communications
with the dead, no baits held out for the
Idle and the curious, no salaried officials,
no political schemes, no mercenary condi
tions, nor a theoretic study of the myste
rious and occult. NO, none of these, in
deed, but the practical co-operation of a
practical people in all that enables and
develops the higher life by an unselfish
devotion to the service of the race. . There
is no room here for self-seekers.
The delegates are not scattered, hare
brained Individuals, but afford a striking
illustration of being common sense busi
ness people, who know what they are
about, brotherhood being their first and
fojemost idea.
The American 'flag with its glorious
stare and stripes will wave over The am
phitheater erected on the site of the
school for the revival of the lost mys
teries of antiquity. Truly a fitting symbol
of the return of old glory to this ancient
land of America.
The flags of every land will also find
fitting places beside this emblem of free
dom, emphasizing the international char
acter of the congress.
The following was the programme of
to-day's proceedings:

LOS ANGELES, April 13.â Frank D.
Sanborn, who was until a week ago bal
ance clerk in the Los Angeles National
Bank, was one of the most trusted em
ployes of the Institution. Billiards, cours
ing and personal habits were his undoing.
The report that Sanborn was $250 short in
his accounts is not denied at the bank,
but explained by a statement "that if
Sanborn overdrew his account it has been
made good." Sanborn, who is 23. is a
nephew of Mrs. Felix C. Howes, whose
husband was formerly connected with the
same bank. When she turned the cold
shoulder on him he went to San Francisco
and last Tuesday, it is stated, he left for

HONOLULU, April s.â lt was learned just before the departure of the
Rio de Janiero for San Francisco that the Queen Dowager Kapio

VALUABLE COAL
DEPOSIT FOUND
Located at Sandy Cove
on the Mainland.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VICTORIA, B. C, April 13.â The
steamer Queen City, which reached
here this morning from Naas, brings
news of the finding of what promises
to be a very valuable coal deposit at
Sandy Cove, a short distance from
Cape Caution, on the British Columbia
mainland, ; faeir- Queen Charlotte
Sound, and just above the northern ex
tremity of Vancouver Island.
The "find was made a short time ago
by three Vancouver men, who have
lately been boring with a diamond drill.
testing it for a Vancouver company.
The miners found a wide seam of irood
coal thai will not only warrant devel
opment, but will make fortunes for the
lucky discoverers, for the coal lands
are close to the watc and in a splen
did position. All the Alaska liners pass
close to there, and it is intended to
build wharves and bunkers and ma
chinery to coal these vessels. At pres
ent the majority of the vessels plying
northward coal at -Departure Bay,
Comos or Union, but the newly found
property is undoubtedly in a better
position than any of the other sta
tions, and on this account will prob
ably be the favorite coaling port.
The Vancouver owners will send a
force of men and a quantity of ma
chinery north to develop the property
by the Queen City on Saturday.

locating all delegates as fast as their
orders come in. The committee will go
to San Francisco on Saturday to attend

STANFORD'S AX SHARPENED.
So Berkeley Ball Players Would Bet
ter Look After Their Laurels.
PALO ALTO, April 13.â An enthusiastic
send-off was given the Stanford baseball
team to-night. The entire college as
sembled around the Varsity diamond and
by the light of a huge bonfire proceeded
to go through the ceremony of sharpen
ing the Stanford "ax" for the second in
tercollegiate game with Berkeley. Proofs
of the dullness of the Stanford hatchet
were recalled to the collegians by Eng
lish '00, who told of the recent defeats of
the cardinal. After grievances were re-
Cited a grindstone was produced, on which
the ax 'was sharpened. A Berkeley
dummy was produced and the keen edge
of the newly ground ax severed the head
from the body. The proof was sufficient,
and the ceremonies were concluded with
speeches and songs.
GRANT'S FINANCIAL
BACKER IS FOUND

RELATIVE OF R. C. KERENS
DETERMINED TO HAVE HIS PRO
TEGE A SENATOR.
New Stories of Election Echoes of the
Last State Election and Knif
â¢ ing at Sunny San
Diego.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 13.â state
ment was made in these dispatches
some days ago that U. S. Grant Jr.,
in his candidacy for United States Sen
ator, received financial aid from one of
the individual stockholders of the San
ta Fe Railroad. The identity of Grant's
friend is revealed in the person of D.
C. Kenna, one of the vice presidents
and head of the legal department of
the system. Kenna is a. son-in-law of
R. C. Kerens of Missouri, who, it ap
pears, determined that his young pro
tege should represent California in the
United States Senate.
Word comes from San Diego that
local conditions may interfere with the
plans of the theosophists in establish
ing the Universal Brotherhood of Man.
The story goes that U. S. Grant's long
knife is out for all who rest under the
suspicion of opposing his Senatorial as
pirations. The latest record of knifing
in the southland is the thrust under
the fifth rib which Mayor Reed of San
Diego recently received. A stout de
nial is made that Grant wielded the
knife, yet it is clear to all that some
one used it and that one belonged to
the Grant legion. ; "* ; .
â¢ When Gage was knifed in San Diego
the followers of Grant asserted that
their leader was loyal to the Repub
lican nominee for Governor. Grant
himself joined in a disclaimer of the
knifing, so far as he was concerned,
with a vigor that astonished his ad
herents. Before the question was set
tled as to where the responsibility rest
ed for knifing the Republican candidate
for Governor in that city, the Repub
lican nominee for Mayor was knifed,
hence it is that the eyes of the poli
ticians are turned to Grant's lone
weapon. For a peace-loving states
man, Grant seems to be concerned in
a good many political cutting affrays.
"OUR PRIVILEGE TO
SWAP THE GAME"
The New York Herald Comments on
The Call's Editorial Concerning
Trading the Philippines.
NEW YORK, April 13.â The Herald will

Philippines for the British West Indies is

Having delivered himself of this mor

to ask the following questions:
"Have you or have you not been ten

"I decline to answer whether I have

Attempts were made to measure the
distance to the mouth of the well,
where has been the bottom of the pit.
but a 300-foot line would not reach
halfway down. The best estimates
placed it at about SOO feet. As to the
distance to the bottom of the well, as
it now exists, no one will hazard a

Natives of the district were inter

They say that the signs are the same as
those observed just before the big flows

STOOD OFF THE
CITY MARSHAL
Mrs. Broome Fights for
Her Hedge.
Special Di .patch to The Call.
SANTA BARBARA. April Aided
by her gardener, Mrs. Broome, a promi
nent Santa Barbara lady, held fourteen
workmen and the City Marshal at bay.
One year ago the City Council notified
Mrs. Broome to destroy a hedge that
obstructed a public highway, and which
extended sixteen fqgt beyond her prop
erty.
The matter of establishing the official
: grade on that street has been agitated
\ for a long while, and finally the sen
sation of the obstruction reached a
climax this morning. Marshal Martin,
accompanied by his deputy and a force
of workmen, went to the place to dis
charge their duties, but met with a de
termined resistance on the part of Mrs.
â  Broome and her hired man. She seized
a pick, made for the officer, and struck
him a blow on the shin which, may
i prove serious. Martin took the imple
ment from her and she immediately
'. made straightway for another, but be-
I fore she had taken a few steps she was
I overpowered and arrested. .
They next proceeded to arrest the
hired man, Alexander Vanezuela, who
was armed with a .revolver and club.
â  Had it not been for the extreme care
they used in performing the operation
it might have cost the life of one of the
men. Martin attracted Vanezuela's at
: tention while Richardson, his deputy,
came noiselessly from behind and dis
armed him.
Both Mrs. Broome and her man were
conducted to the City Jail. When
brought into the Police Court she was
read the complaint charging her with
resisting an officer and informed of the
' nature of the offense. Although bail
! was offered her, she refused, and stated
that she would not employ a counsel.
1 She further stated that she had been
1 unlawfully arrested and would main
; tain that position, on account of her
nationality, being British, and will
bring the matter into the Federal court.
In the meantime the work of remov
j ing the obstructions over which the
trouble occurred went on and was soon
< completed. The prisoners were released
on their own recognizance. This is a
high misdemeanor and must be tried in
the Superior Court.
REMARKABLE FEAT
OF A FLYING FISH
Goes Through All Kinds of Pipes on
the City of Puebla Before Land
ing in a Bucket.
HONOLULU, April s.â Chief Engineer
Cress of the City of Puebla, now in port,
tells of the miraculous escape from death
of a "malolo," or. flying fish, aboard the
transport while on the way from San
Francisco to Honolulu.
It was noticed upon nearing the islands
that one of the pump valves was clogged
by some foreign substance. Upon open
ing the faucet wide a flying fish flopped
out, and falling into a bucket of water
beneath began swimming about very
briskly.
Before making its appearance in the
bucket the fish had to do a lot of travel
ing over an uncomfortably circuitous
route. It undoubtedly entered the ship

HONOLULU, April The United

morrow. The soldiers aboard her are all
In fine condition. During their stay in
Honolulu they have been taken out for ex

The United States transport Zealardia
arrived in port early this morning. As it
was impossible for her to secure wharf
room, she was anchored in the stream.
Officers and men are in good condition,
having had a fine voyage from San Fran

about four days. The good weather from
San Francisco is a surprise to him, as he

MARY MURDOCH
TELLS HER STORY
Plaintiff in Celebrated.
Suit Is Heard.
HOW THE NOTE WAS MADE
DUE TO SETTLEMENT BETWEEN
SAM AND WILLIAM.
Other Important Witnesses Heard,
and the Note Which Is Now the
Bone "of Contention Is Posi
tively Identified.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, April 13.â The Murdock
case opened this morning at 9:30 o'clock
and the matter of the objection of the
defense to the plaintiff, Mary Helen
Murdock, testifying was argued. The
contention of the defense was that the
plaintiff was incompetent under section
1880 of the Code of Civil Procedure of
this State.
The point was argued fully by both
sides and submitted. The court ruled
that the objection was good and sus
tained it.
After the ruling, however, a short
consultation was had and the defense
withdrew all objections to the plain
tiff testifying and she was immediately
placed upon the stand, and told all
about the note and its making. She
said that she was called home from Al
len Springs by some message, and ar
rived home at about midnight on April
4, 1877. On September 5, 1877, William
and Samuel Murdock met her at her
home, and after completing a settle
ment of their affairs, extending over a
period of some fifteen years, and the
note in question given as evidence of
that settlement, Samuel gave William
two notes, one of $26,000 and one of a
smaller sum and $20,000 in gold coin.
Witness knew of other sums of money
passing from Samuel to William prior
to the making of the $100,000 note.
Witness said that the agreement was
mutual between the two men, and that
it was the wish of Samuel that the
note be made payable to plaintiff, in
order that his two grandchildren should
get the money. The time of twenty
years was also made for that purpose,
as Samuel said that at that time the
boys would be wise enough to know the
value of money.
Witness made a good appearance and
General Barnes was unable to shake
her in the least, after a severe cross
examination.
The next witness was H. A. Skiff,
who in IS9O was present at an inter
view between the plaintiff and William
Murdock, in which the plaintiff asked
William for a payment of interest on
the note, which request was refused,
William remarking that the plaintiff
ought to be satisfied, as she held his
note for $100,000, and it would all be
pail when due.
An effort will be made to impeach
the witness by attempting to show
contradictory statements made to par
ties in the State, of Washington.
C. B. Ashurst testified to ..having
called at G. W. Murdock's place on the
4th of. September, 1877, and paid Samuel
$10,000 that he owed him, which sum
was turned over to William on the fol
lowing day when the $100,000 note was
made. Ashurst is a brother of the
plaintiff and was formerly very wealthy
and was handling a great dear of
money and business at the time of this
transaction.
B. I. Robinson, an attorney, now of
San Francisco but formerly of Sacra
mento, testified to having seen the nu'p
in question at the State fair at Sacra
mento in September, 1877. He identi
fied the note, having had it in his pos
session at that time, making an ex
amination of It for a client of his, a
Dr. Hicks.
Plaintiff's attorneys announced at
the close of the day's session that they
would in all probability rest to-morrow.
FARMERS OF YOLO
EXPECT GOOD CROPS
They Are Ordering New Agricultural
Implements in Anticipation of
the Harvest.
WOODLAND, April 13.â The opinion of
a farmer of many years' experience is
that all the summer-fallow wheat and a
great deal of the winter-sown will make
good crops without another drop of rain,
and that the normal amount of spring
showers will insure the largest crop that
has been harvested for many years.
One of the best indications that the
farmers are of the opinion that crop pros
pects are better than usual is to be found
in the fact that they are giving large or
ders for agricultural Implements. A
Woodland dealer recently made a can
vass among the river farmers in the in
terest of improved mowers. The result of
that canvass surprised his most sanguine
expectations. It is best told in the lan
guage of the steamboat men. On the
last trip of the San Jose up the river she
was just twenty-four hours behind regu
lar time. When asked why this was so
the captain explained that his cargo of
freight was larger than usual, 'and," he
added, "there Is hardly a landing on, the
Sacramento River at which we did, not
stop and unload a lot of agricultural ma
chinery."
DOING BUSINESS BY BOATS.
Promise of Activity at the Yolo
County Landings.
"WOODLAND, April 13.â Owing to the
fact that the flood water is subsiding rap
idly and that the road to Elkhorn will be
open for travel much sooner than usual,
that place is likely to become an impor
tant landing this season. Woodland mer
chants are making a practice, at favor
able seasons of the year, of shipping a
great deal of their heaviest freight from
San Francisco by-boat. In this way they
not only secure better rates, but they
furnish "employment for Yolo County men
and teams.
It is probable that the bulk of the grain
bags to be used in Yolo County will be
landed from boats at Yolo County land
ings. *
To Circulate Danish Literature.
PETALUMA, April 13.â T0-day's session
of the Grand Lodge of Dania. consisted of
routine work. The matter of establishing
a library of Danish literature was
brought up and hotly debated. It is the
idea of the promoters to secure literature,
elect a grand librarian, divide the books
into sections and distribute divisions to
subordinate lodges at a specified time, to
be rotated' to tne different lodges and
thus kept in circulation. The sess.on ad
journed at 4 o'clock. The delegates visit
ed the electric light and cold storage
plants. Bryan shoe factory, Caralson-Cur
rier silk mills and other points of interest.
Sudden Death at Woodland.
WOODLAND, April 13.â O. Weed died

He has been very despondent of late on
account of financial worries.. He came

NIMRODS WILL
WEAR MOURNING
No Hunting in Marin for
Five Years.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN RAFAEL, April When the
! Supervisors met to-day it was confi-
I dently predicted that they would
] adopt the proposed ordinance making
it a misdemeanor either to carry or
' ship game or fish out of Marin County, i
.By the advice of Attorney Boyd and
. District Attorney Mclsaac, however,
i the matter was simply discussed infor
mally and action postponed until next
Wednesday.
The reason for this procedure was the
| objections raised by the Country and
; Tamalpais clubs that, while the board
' could prevent the shipping of game
and fish, any ordinance prohibiting a
' person carrying them out of the county
, would be unconstitutional. To effect
the desired result it was thought best
to frame an ordinance about which
there can be no question, and it was
proposed that such be accomplished by
! prohibiting the killing of game or
catching of fish for five years.
The original measure intended for
adoption was presented to the Supervis
ors by Attorney Boyd in the form of a
petition from the San Rafael Gun Club,
the Novato Gun Club and a large num
ber of ranchers and sportsmen who be
, long to no organization of the kind
whatever. It was really aimed at the
Country and Tamalpais clubs, the
, members of which live principally in
San Francisco. These two clubs have
i vast preserves and control the best
j shooting and fishing grounds in the
\ county. Huntsmen belonging to these
! clubs kill a big amount of game every
j open season and have always prose
cuted poachers to the full extent of the
\ law. It was a feeling on the part of
i residents of Marin County that these
1 clubs themselves are really interlopers
' that led to the petition placed before
the* board. * â  'â¢ â¢ J ." -. >"â  >_ , : /â¢â¢.
' It was agreed to-day that Chairman
1 Barr.and Attorney Boyd collaborate in
the. framing of an ordinance preventing
the killing of game err catching of fish
iin the county for five years. Measures
, will also be taken to form a protective
association on the part of all the local
j clubs and huntsmen, the object of which
: shall be an endeavor to see that in the
i future all game laws are more strin
gently enforced.
The proposed ordinance will meet
with vigorous opposition from the mem
; bers of the Country and Tamalpais
; clubs, for its adoption virtually means
I their death. Three of the Supervisors
j are said to be in favor of any ordinance
| Boyd and Barr may agree upon under
I any circumstances, and if they remain
i firm the clubs in question will be pow
| erless to avoid the blow. Supervisor
| Petersen favored such an ordinance
last week, but to-day entered the
doubtful list. - : â 
SHAVER WILL CASE
FINALLY DISMISSED
Contestants See Inevitable Defeat and
Quit the Fight.
SAX RAFAEL, April 13.â The contest
ants of the will of the late Aaron Shaver
have given up the struggle and permitted
the court to dismiss the case after firing
the first shot. This move comes as a sur
prise to the public, because from the al
legations made In the complaint and the
frame of mind of the contestants a long
legal battle was expected. No effort was
made to compromise the case. It was
concluded that the facts would not war
rant a suit at law and the expense due
to an inevitable defeat, so the matter has
simply been stricken from the calendar.
Aaron Shaver died at an advanced age
about two months ago and left one-third
of his estate, variously estimated to be
worth from $30,000 to $40,000, to his brother
Jacob, and the remainder to his pretty
young wife. Margaret, to whom he had
been married only a few years prior to
his death. This . marriage was strongly
opposed by the relatives at the time, and
when the terms of the will were made
public Harriet B. Shaver, a sister-in-law.
and other relatives contested the will on
behalf of themselves and their children.
Just as the case was to go into court
for a first- hearing they deserted their
guns and had the case dismissed.

But the District Attorney Expects to
Show a Conspiracy to Convert
State Money to Private
Use.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PHILADELPHIA, April 13.â 1n the
trial of ex-Senator Quay to-day District
Attorney Rothermel placed upon the
stand the paying and receiving .tellers
and bookkeepers of trie broken . Peo
ple's Bank to prove the bosks. AH of
these, in answer to questions, made
reference to Senator Quay's account *
and the bookkeepers said they had eh-**"
tered the figures, but none of the books
were opened to show what the nature
of the account was. This will be.-done
later.
All of the bank employes on cross
examination stated that they had : ne"ver
seen Senator Quay's deposit book and
that they did not believe there wai?Vpne.
It had been hinted that the defense
will claim that Senator Quay's accounts
in the ledger were fictitious as far as
' he was concerned and that the Sena
tor's name was used by Hopkins, as a
cloak for his own personal transactions.
The cross-examination to-day would
seem to bear out this theory. : .--
Th- red book was a big feature of
the day's proceedings, figuring dndi
rectly in the testimony of several-wit
nesses. Its pages, were gone over re
peatedly and the question of its iden
tification with the business of the bank
was discussed, and when court ad
journed a handwriting expert was on
the stand identifying the writing in it
as the work of Hopkins. All of this
was accomplished by the District At
torney in spite of the protests of the
three acute, aggressive lawyers em
ployed by Senator Quay, who fought in
vain against the webs of circumstantial
evidence involving the red book to such
an extent that it seems almost certain
that this necessary piece of evidence
will have to be admitted after aIL
It was evident from the District At- A
I torney's attitude to-day that he pro-'
â¢ poses to formally offer the book in cvi
' dence in a day or so, and he appears
confident of his ability to order the
: testimony which its pages contain and
j which is so vita! in trie establishment
iof the charge of conspiracy between
j Quay, Haywood and Hopkins to use the
! money of the State for illicit gain.

Ostler Joe and the crowd followed
him, but the black horse collapsed when
half the distance had been reeled off. and
was beaten out cleverly by Storm King,
Of six favorites, three were ag .n suc
cessful ln winning purses. In several in
stances long priced outsiders were knock
ing at the door and the season for "tak
ing shots at the moon" Is now* ripe.
Tom Latta finally engaged a competent
rider to pilot Rev Hooker, and the good
colt took the first event at six furlongs
in clever fashion. With Plpgott up, he
closed favorite and won by a couple of
lengths. Genua, which cut out the run
ning, led Wing out a length for the place.
The latter Ally pulled up bleeding from
the nose.
The flve-furlong scramble was ortly a
"set-up" for Flora Hawk. The flying
mare, with Thorpe in the saddle, started
a 1 to 2 favorite and won an the way.
Crawford, a 50 to 1 shot backed down to
12, took the place from Melvln Burnham,
a 200 to 1 outsider. The second choice,
February, finished back in the ruck.
In a former race Limerick showed such
strong finishing power that the Daly en
try was installed a stanch favorite for the
live-furlong p-year-old dash. Away in
front, the Tammany youngster was quick
ly passed by Silver Tail, which led to the
end, heating Ned Dennis out in a hard
drive. The favorite ran third. .
The mile and a sixteenth run developed |
a surprise . Arbaces, the brother to Diggs,
Sutton and <>iinthus, took command in the
stretch, and, ridden out, downed the fa
vorite. Joe rilman. less than a length in
the fast time of 1:46 V.. Hugh Penny was
close third. The winner was 6 to 1 In the
ring.
The five-furlong sprint for fillies was
only a gallop for Miss Marion. At pro
hibitive odds, she ran away from tne oth
er starters. El Estro flnisheu second.
Ostler Joe .appointed his friends in
the concluding mile run. Sent to the post
a 4 to 5 chance, he was unable to shake
off Storm King, and at the wire suc
cumbed by less than a length in 1:42*4.

"A HOT OLD TIME."
The Rays to Reopen the California
Theater With Their Breezy
Farce-Comedy.
On Monday evening next the California
: Theater is to be reopened with a farce
'â  comedy that promises much pleasure to
playgoers. The old San Francisco fa
vorites, Johnny and Emma Ray, are
scheduled to produce their latest success,
"A Hot Old Time." The lines in the play
are said to be breezy and bright and give
I the members of the company many op
portunities for showing their versatility.
George M. Cohen, who has gained fame
as a farceur, has touched up the comedy
in his Inimitable style. Original songs and
a number of strong specialties have been
I Introduced to add interest to the produc
tion. The Rays have gathered a score of
| clever artists around them and it is con
â  fidently said they will be kindly received
' by the critical local public. Many of them
have appeared in this city before and es
| tablished themselves as favorites.
In the play Mr. and Mr?. Ray appear
in their original characters of Larry
Mooney and Mrs. General Blazer, and are
; supported by the following people: Dolph
. and Susie Levino, Frank Lalor, Dave
. Genaro and Ray Bailey, Harry Dull.
Hayes and Healy, "William Finley. Robert
Cone, Fanny Mora, Vernla Lalor, Minerva
Adams ' and Helen. Bronner.
Very* elegant costumes, designed by
Mrs. Ray, are worn by the ladies .of the
company, who are pretty and. good sing
ers. A cake walk by Genaro and Bailey
is a feature of the performance. The lat
ter are said to be unexcelled in this spe-
c ialty.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 14, 1899.
TWO "ANGELS"
FOLD THEIR
WINGS AND QUIT
A Dramatic Frost at
the Alhambra.
ONE MORE THEATRICAL WRECK
SIX ACTORS WANT TICKETS TO
GO HOME.
Edward Holden Flashed the Local
Capital for the Enterprise, but
He Could Not Draw
Crowds. â¢ .
Two "angels" of .the drama have folded
their little wings this week and become_
"dead uns." Their "names are Henry Mac-
Donald and Thomas Kilgo. They were
good things while they lasted, but will
soon be indistinguishable amid the
wrecks that crowd on memory at the
Alhambra. They are theatrical ghosts
that refuse to walk, even for the half
dozen members of the stock company
brought here from the East to electrify
San Francisco at "ten, twenty and
thirty."
Less than three months ago the an
gelic qualities of Mac Donald and Kilgo
were discovered in this city, of which
both are residents, by Actor E. J. Holden.
He had a new venture in mind and had
â¢no trouble in introducing it to the heav
enly visitants. They fell in love with the
idea and soon .Holden was on his way
East to â¢ secure actors for the company,
Mac Donald and Kilgo having agreed to
flutter their wings for the necessary cash,
Holden to get a salary as stage manager
and a working interest in the venture.
The Alhambra Theater was rented for
two monthsâ from March 1 to May l and
the thrilling melodrama, a blood curdler
from away back, "Dewey, the Hero of
Manila," was put in. rehearsal for the
opening week.
In due time Holden returned from New
| York, having signed there six people for
i the stock company, for a season of eight
weeks. In addition to their salary, they
were promised, >as In all cases of such
[ short engagement so far from home, that
I they would be given return transporta
! tion. The six were Thomas Doyle, late
j leading man with Fanny Davenport;
1 Charles Swain, who . was such a popular
I comedian at Morosco's; De Witt Clinton,
' whose great grandfather was the cele
i brated Secretary or the Treasury of the
i United States of that name, whose face
I looks out from the revenue stamp on all
i cigarette boxes; Joseph Tracy, Miss
Laura Alberta, leading lady, and Miss
Florence Rossland, ingenue. -.. .
"Dewey, the Hero of Manila." was put
i on for the first time at the Alhambra on
I the night of March 6, the Eastern per
formers being reinforced by the necessary
I local talent. It went with a whoop. Red
, fire and tin thunder, bullets ana blood
! flashed and rattled and whistled and
flowed through four fierce acts; Spanish
j were slaughtered by the thousand; Hob-
I son flew all the way from Santiago at the
rise of the curtain to Cavite in the last
act, just in time to raise seventeen sunken
ships and put the "kibosh" on any little
idea the enemy might have had that it
was still alive and kicking. The first
week's receipts were very good and "The
Hero of Manila" might have been given
an extended run for his money had not
Holden provided otherwise. He had also
engaged, while in New York, Agnes Hern
don as leading .lad^ and announced that
for the second week he would put on "La
Belle Marie." He did, but that gifted lady
failed to touch a responsive chorcFTn the
public breast and the receipts dwindled
as fast as the hopes of the "angels."
"Saved From the Flames" and "Married,
Not Mated," were tried in the succeeding
two weeks with even worse luck, and
"The Sunny South," a war drama, with
plantation songs thrown In, was produced
last Monday night in a despairing effort
to coax coin into the house.
The frost that struck "The Sunny
South" shriveled up the hopes of all. It
was a nipper and no mistake, and al
though Holden insisted in putting on the
drama the next night, it was no use.
The temperature was too much for it and
it died an unnatural death. The snow
drifted about the doors of the Alhambra.
and they did not open Wednesday night
and there Is no telling when they will.
Never again, however, under the triple
headed management pf Holden, Mac Do
nald and Kilgo.
The "angels" are supposed to have
dropped $5000 between them, Mac Donald
three-fifths of that, and yet all the cred
itors of the short-lived management are
not satisfied. The six actors brought
from the East for the "Hero of Manila"
are still waiting for their return' tickets,
and are none too sanguine that they will
get them.
The cause of the failure is laid at the
door of Holden, who is accused by mem
bers of the company of a sort of loftiness
that was very trying at times, and is said
to have Interfered with good work. In ad
dition, he is said to have avoided tne
usual channels^ of advertising, and this
is declared to nave been h.-Â» most costly
mistake. He might have drawn people
even to the "Sunny South" had they had
any means of ascertaining that that play
was being given.

sisters.
They are a happy lot, those black
skinned warriors, with never a care nor
a thought of the morrow. The veterans
among them recall the days before the
Spanish war, when they were stationed
continually on the frontier in small gar
risons, where all the routine duties de
volved upon a few men, the more desira
ble stations being given to the white
troops. But their work in ..the Santiago
campaign earned for them something bet
ter than "herding Indians," and they have
been rewarded with the finest station in
the service, where enough troops are con
stantly stationed to divide the work and
give them all plenty of leisure.
They are a never-failing source of
amusement to the white cavalrymen and
the casuals at the Presidio bound
for the Philippines, and the best
of feeling prevails. When the regi
ment was recruiting up to its maxi
mum strength at the breaking out of the
war the recruits were drawn almost
wholly from the plantations of the South,
and the quaint negro dialect, with its
simple humor, broken by contagious guf
faws, is heard on all sides. They are as
frolicsome as a litter of kittens, and the
white boys readily join in their sports.
Yesterday afternoon there was a hotly
contested ball game on the old parade
ground between teams from the Twenty
fourth and the white soldiers. The scorer
grew weary and gave up his job after a
few innings, but the players kept right
along with the game. In another part of
the field a squad of whites and blacks
mixed up indiscriminately in a football
match. All the other soldiers on the res
ervation who were off duty divided their
attention between the games, cheer
ing the players on to greater efforts.
Out-of-dcor sports are all right with the
white boys, but when the newcomers sug
gest a game of craps it is different. Many
of the men have families and stylishly
dressed maids and matrons and rollicking
pickanninies abound. %
Johnny Morrisey could go out to the
Presidio and pick up some cake walkers,
buck and wing dancers and musical come
dians that would discount most of his
imported talent.
Preparations are being rushed. for the
reception of more troops en route to the
Philippines. Carpenters are putting up
wooden kitchens on the camp ground near
the eastern entrance for the accommoda
tion of troops in transit, while the new
barracks are rapidly nearing completion.
Eight batteries of the Sixth Artillery will
arrive in a day or two and sail on the
transport Warren about the 18th Inst.
The Newport will sail on or about the
20th, carrying a battalion of marines and
two batteries of artillery.
The famous Twenty-first Infantry Will
arrive here next Sunday or Monday, and
will sail on the transport Hancock. Light
Battery E, First Artillery, now at the
Presidio, will also sail on the Hancock.
Acting Assistant Surgeon W. A. Mc-
Yean has been assigned to duty at the
Presidio General Hospital. Acting Assist
ant Surgeon R. F. Gray has been relieved
from duty on the transport Warren and
assigned to the general hospital. Acting
Assistant Surgeon R. E. Williams has

When* the band wheeled Into Steuart

slipped on the pavement and fell. The
rider was playing at the time and did not '
have a chance to get his foot from the

right leg. No bones were broken, but the
skin from the knee to the ankle was
scraped away. Corporal Thornton was on

A BABY PRISONER
Judge Conlan Severely Reprimands
Secretary Wadham of the Eu
reka Society.
Mrs. Edna Aubray and her two-year
old baby girl appeared before Judge Con
lan yesterday, the mother to.' answer a
charge of vagrancy. preferred against her
by her father, Captain Van Pelt, and the
child to be sent to a public institution.
The Judge ordered the name of the
child to be stricken from the calendar
and characterized her arrest by Secretary
AVadham of the Eureka Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children "as a
gross outrage. It would remain an indeli
ble stain upon an innocent child to have
her name upon the prison register, and
he was amazed and indignant at any of
ficer being guilty of such an outrageous
act. B^bBQRS-P'' .
Mrs. Aubray's case.was. was continued till
to-morrow. She is out on her own recog
nizance, and Wadham wanted Prosecut
ing Attorney Lowe to; get the Judge to
order her into custody; but he indignant
ly refused. The case will probably be
transferred to another court, as Judge
Conlan is acquainted with the defend-
ant. â  _ â 'â â¢â  r
Both Mrs. Aubray's husband and her
father were in court. Mrs. Aubray is
indignant at her arrest by Wadham,
which she says Is persecution, and she
threatens to horsewhip him. Wadham de
fends his conduct by declaring that he
knows the woman Is not a fit person to
have the custody of. the child, and that
he was granted, letters of guardianship
over the youngster last December.'

NEVILLS AND
HIS PARTNERS
COMPROMISE
Agree to Sell the
Rawhide Mine.
LITIGATION TO BE DROPPED
PRICE OF THE PROPERTY FIXED
AT $1,800,000.
A Written Compact and Final Ar
rangements Placed in the Hands
of a Trusted Mutual
'â '*{â *: y Friend.
Captain W. A. Nevills and his warring
partners, W. H. Martin and John Ballard,
in the celebrated Rawhide mine, '; have
agreed to settle the several pending suits
between them in a novel manner. The plan
of compromise evolved from a bluff mage
by Martin and Ballard, according to the
version of the affair given yesterday by
Captain Nevills.
Believing that his partners were endeav
oring to take advantage of him in con
nection with a certain deal that was pend
ing for the sale of the mining property,
Nevills about three months ago began suit
against them to protect his interests. This
suit was followed by two others, Including
one demanding $167,000 damages. Frequent
endeavors â¢ were made by the mutual
friends of the parties to the litigation to
have the matter settled out of court, but
without avail' until three weeks ago...
Martin and Ballard charged that Cap
tain Nevills would not agree to anything
that' was fair. They declared that they
were willing to allow the property to be
sold to third parties and thus put an end
to all disputes, bickerings and lUigatlpn,
but that Nevills would not agree to such a
proposition. This was brought to the
knowledge of the captain; and he prompt
ly sent word back for them to name the
price for which the mine was to be sold
and to put their offer into writing. This
was done and was at once accepted by
Captain Nevills. â  â¢
An agreement was drawn up which the
three men as well as all the smaller
stockholders in the mine signed, by the
terms of which the Rawhide mine was to
be sold at an upset price of $1,800,000. the
proceeds to be divided among the share
owners in proportion to : their holdings.
This agreement has been placed in the
hands of a third party, whose name is
kept a secret, and who is given full power
to dispose of the property. The agree
ment further provides . that all pending
litigation be abandoned.
It Is said that a prospective buyer has
been found and that he will make a visit
to the mine in- about a week. Owing to
the lack of water the mine has not been
worked for the past six months, but pre
vious to that time its output is reported
to have been $40,000 a month.
This Will Be Methodist Day.
The third in the series of lunches at the
old hall of the Young Men's Christian As
sociation, 232 Sutter street, will take place
to-day,; and the Methodist churches will
have charge and . a bevy- of . young ladies
from this denomination will serve the ta
bles. There is a greut deal of enthusi
asm manifested and' thd lunches have been
largely patronized. All interested should
get their lunch at the hall to-day.
To-morrow will be Congregational day,
and a specialty will be made of New Eng
land clam chowder. . It is possible that
the lunches may continue over Saturday.

TELEPHONE
COMPANY
UNDER FIRE
Merchants Denounce
Unjust Charges.
COMPLAINT RECENTLY MADE
PRESIDENT SABIN'S "ANSWER"
THAT DOESN'T ANSWER.
Talk of a Large Number of Business
Men Ordering Out Their Hello
â Action To-
Night.
The Merchants' Association is about to
have a little seance with the officers of
the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany relative to what many of the mem
bers of the commercial body believe â¢to
be an injustice in the matter of charging
for switches. At the meeting of the as
sociation this evening it will form no
small part of the business to be consid
ered. Several weeks ago a number of the
members made complaint to the board of
directors of the injustice of paying for a
service that is never rendered. Accord
ing to one of the merchants a subscriber
patronizing a nickel-in-the-slot telephone
calls for a certain number. The operator
at "central" directs the" customer to place
a nickel In the slot, which he does, and
then Waits. Many times he waits in vain
and when he inquires of "central" the
reason for the delay he is informed that
"the subscriber called for does not re
ply," or else he has the phonograph with
an uncanny voice turned loose upon him
with "line is busy call again."
While either may be the truth, still
the customer feels that he is neatly bun
koed out of the nickel that he has depos
ited in the slot, and the information of the
operator that he may call at the main of
fice and receive his change does not soften
his feelings or modify the cuss words that
seem to be the only relief he has in the
premises. - According to the statements of
the gentlemen the telephone company
must secure hundreds of nickels in this
manner for which no service is given. An
other little kick that was made along the
same lines is the local system of charging
for switches. In -many of ..the 'Easiern
cities the telephones are put in at a "fiat
rate"â that Is, a rental is paid for their
use and there the .expense to the sub
scriber ends. In this city a man rents a
'phone and then - pays for the use of it
at bo much per switch. In some .of the
larger houses, where the telephone is con
stantly in use, the bills are something
so large that they make the customers
feel that they are doing much toward
paying off the interest on the companies'
bonds, if there be any.
So many of * these complaints were
made at that meeting that it was decided
to refer the matter to the committee on
public affairs, with instructions to have
a conference with the officials of the tele
phone company with a view of modifying
the conditions complained 01. To this end
a letter was sent to John I. Sabin, presi
dent of the company, setting forth
.he points mentioned and asking for a
meeting between "the company's officers
and representatives of the association.
In time. an answer was received from
President Sabin in which he briefly said
"The inclosed circular, 'What Is a
Switch?' answers the complaint in your
letter under reply." The circular referred
to was a reprint clipping from an evening
paper, published three years ago over
the signature of President Sabin. It is
a dry dissertation upon the running of a
telephone office and the amount of ser
vice rendered by the company in excess
of compensation received. The mercnants
do not teem to comprehend how this cir
cular is an "answer" to their request to
meet and discuss certain matters, which
request is entirely ignored. It will not
be ignored this evening, for it is said that
even thy More conservative element of
the body is thinking of taking a decided
stand for what is regarded as rights of
the subscribers. There is even some talk
of taking out their telephones in a body
if some of the evils complained of are
not remedied in the near future.
SENSATIONAL STORY DENIED.
Gustav Kunst Not the Bearer of Sa-
moan Secret Dispatches^
The sensational story published in an
evening paper regarding Gustav Kunst is
pronounced absolutely and unqualifiedly
false by that gentleman. In the story Mr.
Kunst was made out to be a- secret emis
sary of the German Government traveling
incog and the bearer of official dispatches
from Samoa for his .home country. Ha
arrived on the steamer Rio de Janeiro
yesterday morning and was astounded
when he read the tale of his supposed
mysterious actions in the afternoon.
When seen at the hotel last evening he
indignantly denied the allegations con
tained therein. When asked to give a
statement he willingly acquiesced and
said: ,-'-:. \?. : ,
"The published account regarding my
self is certainly untrue and must have
originated in the fanciful imagination of
some reporter. I was not in any way con
nected with the affairs in Samoa. In fact,
I have not been there for three months.
I am a retired merchant of Hamburg and
went to Honolulu, where I bought an in
terest in the firm of Carter & Co.
"I, as well as the other passengers on
the Rio, did not know anything about the
Samoan trouble until we arrived here, and
I> was surprised to hear that my home in
Vaillma, which I recently purchased, had
been blown up by the British gunboats.
I made no efforts to conceal my identity
and every one on board knew me and
was acquainted to some extent with my
affairs. I am on my way to Hamburg to
put my Interests in such a shape that I
may return to Honolulu.

THE MERCHANTS' ASSOCIATION.
IN giving a review of the work accomplished by
the Merchants' Association for the past three
months the directors at the recent quarterly meet
ing were able to present a report of a highly gratify
ing nature. The report has been published in full in
the current number of the Association Review and
deserves to be read by all who take an intelligent in
terest in municipal affairs.
The association, which next month will hold its
fifth anniversary meeting, has grown from a member
ship of forty-seven public-spirited citizens who organ
ised it to an enrollment of 1052 business firms.
With its increased strength there has been an in
creased usefulness to the city, and the record of the
past justifies the assertion of the report of the di
lectors, that "with an active regiment of 2000 regular
members the strength and usefulness of the Mer
chants" Association would be doubled."
The conditions of San Francisco are such that her.
progressive citizens can count nothing done so long
_s so much remains to be done. Therefore the chief
interest in the report lies not in the review of what
has been accomplished, but in the outline of work
for the future. The directors offer an attractive pro
gramme, conspicuous in which is the suggestion of
reform in the management of the harbor and water
front. On that subject the report says: "No move
ment is of more consequence to San Francisco than
the question of maritime commerce. Every effort
thould be made to foster and encourage the shipping
interests of this port. To this end we believe that the
control and ownership of the harbor front should
revest in San Francisco, and tha 1 . ultimately all harbor
toils should be abolished."
There can be little question concerning the impor
tance of relieving the commerce of the city as far as
possible from the restrictions and burdens now placed
upon it. In these days trade is going to the ports
where the best facilities are offered for shipping. Ad
vantages of geographical location are no longer the
dominant factors in building up ocean pons. Arti
ficial improvements must be made, wise harbor regu
lations adopted, and ample wharf room afforded for
the economical loading and unloading of vessels. San
Francisco must keep up with the demands of ad
vancing civilization and competition in such matters
nr lose her prestige in the commercial world.
â¢The San Lorenzo congregation of the Rev. E. L.
Burnett seems to have been inspired with some rea
son when it. individually and collectively, repu
diated the announcement of the reverend gentleman
that his financial affairs had become the personal.con
cern of God. Pastor Burnett struck for a raise in
salary, and because he did not get it declared, with
some heat, that God, in anger for the indifference of
the Sock, had summarily removed two of its mem
bers from their earthly field of usefulness.
And now it is announced from Paris with a great
flourish of trumpets that a substitute for rubber has
been discovered. It is made from corn. It is really
tco bad that Paris is so far behind the times. Judging
from the amount of extract of corn San Franciscans
have been pouring down their necks, for years, it
would seem that the new substitute for rubber is noth
ing more than a chestnut.
C. P. Huntington has won another victory over the
farmers of California in delaying, for five months, the
decision of the case which was instituted to determine
whether or not grain freight rates should be reduced.
Some of these days C. P. Huntington will discover
that certain victories cost more than defeats.

THE GAMBLERS' REFUGE.
IT was anticipated that the Ingleside racetrack gam
, biers would not be convicted in the Police Court
without a struggle, but it was not expected that
the foundation of their campaign against decency and
good morals would be laid in the department presided
over by Judge Mogan. Ever since his appointment
by the Board of Supervisors to the office of Police
Judge this young man has displayed some of the
strength of character and decision which distinguishes
good administrators of the law. Those who have
watched his course have prophesied that he would
make a record as Police Judge which would prolong
his service in that department of the criminal law.
But if the racetrack gamblers can obtain from him
such a charge as he delivered on Wednesday in the
Jones case there is no longer any hope for him.
Evidently he is inclining strongly toward the cause
of immorality, and the mere impanelment of a jury
for the purpose of obscuring his course will not blind
the public to the fact that he has cast his lot with the
Ingleside gamblers and proposes to stand or fall with
them.
There is no excuse for the delivery of such a charge
as Judge Mogan is reported to have given the jury in
the Jones case. That culprit could hot excuse himself
by pleading that as a bookmaker he was acting for
some one else. It is no palliation of crime to assert
that one is acting by proxy. Every man is responsible
for violating the law, and whether. Jones was em
ployed by somebody or was gambling on his own
account is entirely immaterial in the premises. The
| prosecution proved that Jones made a bet on the 14th
of March for a man named Sandusky, and that should
have been enough to convict him of the offense of vio
lating the municipal ordinance.
If Judge Mogan, thinks that crimes of this sort may
be committed by proxy he is thinking in a manner
entirely at variance with the penal laws and entirely in
consonance with the contentions of the racetrack
gamblers. There is no charity, however, in assuming
that he is ignorant of the law. He has been a Police
! Court practitioner himself and he knows how juries
are "fixed" and Judges ''pulled" in that tribunal. If
the Ingleside gamblers escape through his court he
may as well abandon politics as a means of livelihood
hereafter. No man's personal or political future can
be promoted by assisting the racetrack gamblers to
re-establish their infamous resort at Ingleside. , If
Judge Mogan desires to throw himself away on this
proposition he may as well look the issue square in
the face first as last.
HOME SEEKERS IN WASHINGTON.
ACCORDING to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
the recent effort of the railroads to bring
home-seekers from the East to that State have
already attained a high degree of success. The move
ment was started by President Hill of the Great
Northern, but the other lines terminating at Puget
Sound ports soon followed his lead. As the Post-
Intelligencer says:
"The competing roads did not like it, but they were
forced in self-preservation to meet the cut and ad
vertise for home-seekers, too. This far-sighted rail
road man, not content with bi-weekly colonist ex
cursions, soon announced another innovation, and
made his daily trains carry westward bound folks at
a still less fare,* until now the reduction to $25 from
St. Paul to Seattle is practically permanent."
While no statistics are forthcoming as to the num
ber oi persons who have availed themselves of the
cheap rates, a Minneapolis authority is quoted as es
timating that the railroads from that city will prob
ably carry 20,000 home-seekers to Washington during
the present year. While that is doubtless the exag
geration of an' oversanguine calculator, the prospects
are that the Puget Sound country is to have some
thing of an immigration boom of large proportions.
The greater number of immigrants attracted by
these low rates are not of a kind that could be profit
ably invited to California, where land values are com
paratively high. They seem to be mainly persons of
small means, but of great, hopefulness and enterprise,
who come West to find surer returns for industry
than their former homes afforded. Describing one of
the newly arrived parties the Post Intelligencer says:
"These people will end all right; they have left
the homes that have been theirs, mostly in poverty,
for the last generation or two, full of expectation, and
some of them with only money enough to take them
to some of the farm centers near here and pay for a
filing on a Government homestead. But they are full
of pluck and the stuff that ends them among the very
best citizens; they know how to farm â had to,
01 they could not have eked out even the miserable
lot that befalls the unfortunate Kansan â and with the
inspiriting certainty that a fraction of theii former
effort will give them not only comfort, but after
a while affluence, they are going to transform the now
unpopulated districts of this fertile commonwealth
into scenes of thrift and husbandry and prosperity."
. While California cannot compete with Washington
in the way of inducements to home-seeke.s with but
scant means, the immigration started in that direc
tion is likely to prove beneficial to us by influencing
well-to-do families to follow the movement, and many
of that class are certain to be attracted to California.
At any rate, whatever tends to build up and popu
late the Pacific States cannot fail to be beneficial to
us in some way, and we may therefore feel consider-'
able gratification in the good reports that come to us
, from Washington.
WHOLESALE COLONIZATION.
THE entire area of the world is estimated at fifty
two millions of square miles, of which, at the
end of last year, 22,288,153 were held in the form
of colonies and protectorates by eight European pow
ers. It is interesting to follow the evidences during
the present century of the rapidity with which the
monarchies and empires of Europe have extended
their philanthropic movements to diffuse the light of
Christian civilization and the gospel of peace.
Great Britain has always been the supreme head of
the imperial annexationists. In the eighteenth cen
tury the founders of this republic, antagonizing her
views of colonization by the Declaration of Indepen
dence and by military force, largely reduced her pos
sessions on this continent. Nevertheless, in 1800, as
the net result of a little more than two centuries of
imperial extension, she had acquired, beyond her
home area of 120,079 square miles, a moderate ad
dition to the number of 1,709,004. Eighty years after
ward she ruled 5,022.791 square miles of foreign ter
ritory. Within the last eighteen years her acquisi
tions have swelled to 9,010,003 square miles, or nearly
a fifth of the surface of the globe. !
Prior to 1880 Russia had been a competitor with
Great Britain in the expansion business, having in
creased her territory in eighty years from 1,000.000 to
6,290,327 square miles, but since 1880 she has virtually
abandoned that method of spreading imperial institu
tions, having only gained 265.381 square miles. She has
been succeeded by France and by Germany,
have, displayed great energy in their new occupation,
.but are still far in the distance. *Since 1880 France
THE SAN FKAKCISCO CALL, FEIDAY, APRIL 14, 1899.
has extended her colonial area from 680,764 to 3,617,
--327 square miles. During this same period virtually
the whole of the German colonies, now covering
1,020,070 square miles, have been gained. -.
The total foreign populations within the beneficent
rule of European imperialism number 447,296,859, of
which Great Britain has appropriated as the share of
her Empress-Queen 307,848,122. These figures pos
sess considerable significance for the average Ameri
can citizen and enable us to ascertain with some pre
cision the nature and extent of the new business in
which the advocates of cheap labor and the thirsty
aspirants for imperial glory and for the fruits of im
perial robberies are solicitous that the United States
should entraze. They also suggest the kind of compe
tition before us and the armaments that will be neces
sary to maintain our countryâ as a world power,
for that she is already but as a chief among world
grabbers. At the dawn of the nineteenth century
Spain possessed colonies to the comparatively
modest figure of 1,640,076 square miles, but these
have now dwindled to 405,458. Our total capital,
however, if we start in the new enterprise, though de
rived from Spain and resting on her title, will em
brace only 3670 square miles in Porto Rico and
114,326 in the Philippines, unless the mask is thrown
off with respect to Cuba, when an addition of 41,655
may be computed, or a grand total of 159,651. If we
become an imperial republic on our own hook, as
there is not much of the available surface of the
habitable globe left to steal we shall either have to
be contented with a retail business or bombard the
principles of our Declaration of Independence and of
our constitution into our European neighbors. If we
should enter into a British copartnership our contri
bution of capital would be inadequate and our in
terest in the profits so limited that we should be a
comparatively insignificant member of the firm.
On the whole it would be better for us to adhere to
our own soil, to improve and increase, our own Cau
casian population, to develop our own resources, to
hold our Government to the basis of popular sover
eignty, constitutionally regulated, and to depend upon
expansion that is inherent in liberty, law and order,
and the natural evolution of distinctive Americanism.
THE PARADOX OF IMPERIALISM.
THE American Law Review for March-April
contains two arguments â one for and the other
against the constitutional right of the United
States to acquire and hold foreign colonies. An
article on "Expansion and the Constitution," power
fully written, enforces the views of the question that
have been frequently urged by The Call, and turhs
upon a proposition, generally accepted until the false
hoods and the sophistries of imperialism were im
pressed into the service of expatriated Americans,
which it expresses in these cogent terms:
"Our instituted Government represents the sover
eignty of our nation only in regard to our foreign
relations. It is not true that it can exercise the power
of other sovereign nations unless expressly prohibited j
by our constitution; but the reverse is true, that it
can rightfully exercise only such authority "as is ex
pressly delegated by our constitution."
But an article on "Our Right to Acquire and Hold
Foreign Territories" is perhaps the most painful illus
tration yet published of the inherent wickedness of
imperialism. It flagrantly reverses a doctrine, rarely
questioned in our national history, by the assertion
that, as to external and international relations "the
Federal Government possesses every sovereign power
not expressly prohibited by the constitution." Upon
this radically untrue assumption it bases a series of I
propositions, each accompanied by citations of ad
judicated cases and each of which is made to assume
a meaning never designed by the court from which it
emanated and thus misapplied and misused to fortify
a conclusion that, two short years ago, would have
been denounced as treasonable. The writer of the
article supplies our Government with a double face,
one beaming on this continent with the beauty of i
freedom and equality and the other turned in the j
direction of the Orient with the hard and brutal ex
pression of saturated despotism. He claims that the j
United States can acquire territory in any manner
or in any place, that in such territories the Federal
constitution has no application, that they can be held,
treated, used and governed exactly as we please, that
the power of Congress over them is more absolute
than over any other national property, that within |
them the people have inalienable rights, that there
is no implication that they shall be guaranteed a re
publican form of government or that taxation and
representation shall be correlative, that their inhab
itants are not citizens and that there is no require
ment that they shall ever be converted into States.
We have now one example at least of the manu
factured premises, the monstrous perversions, the
falsifications and the shameless abuse of learning and
of the reasoning faculty, of which the extreme im
perialists are capable. Every case quoted in the article
in question strengthens the argument that furnishes
the antidote to this allopathic dose of legal prussic
acid. The ingenuities of diabolism are almost un
limited, but they are easily exposed. The Call has
published many extracts from the writings of states
men and jurists and many historical facts to prove
that the entire structure of imperialism in the United
States is "the baseless fabric of a vision." Among
the reserved precedents in our history there is one,
however, to which it is here appropriate to allude.
The ordinance of July 13, 1787, "for the government
of the territory of the United States northwest of the
river Ohio" is still extant in the Revised Statutes of
the United States. In its preliminary declaration,
'unalterable unless by common consent," its chief
object as a.s|igned was "to provide also for the estab
lishment of States and permanent government there
in and for their admission to a share in the Federal
councils on an equal footing with the original States
at as early a period as may be consistent with the
general interest." Article 5 declares that "the said ter
ritory and the States which may be formed therein
shall forever remain a part of the confederacy of the
United States," and the ultimate purpose of the com
pact is expressed in Article 6: "There shall be formed
in the said territory not less than three nor more than
five States." The five States, including Ohio, In
diana and Illinois, were formed in compliance with
this blended legislation and contract, which has been
substantially followed in the treaties and literally in
the Congressional action through which, by contigu
ous territorial accretions, the Union has been extend
ed to the Pacific.
Our .political machinery will not propel a republic
on this continent and an empire in Asia, and Uncle
Sam, while he rejoices in his American children and
in their expanding capacity for self-government, will
not borrow the juggernaut car of Great Britain to
crush liberty and independence among the Filipinos.
For the first time since the birth of the American
republic English and American guns have been fired
at a common foe. The sailors of Uncle Sam and
John Bull have fought side by side a savage enemy.
In that conflict some have died. It may be that death
may bring to the two great English-speaking nations
a reunited life and a broader fraternity. v - : ".*.r'
RANCH AND RURAL LIFE
The Russian famine, covering a region bounded by a line drawn from
Moscow to Kiev, reaching as far north as Archangel and embracing the
grain districts of Samara, Saratoff and Simbirsk. is of more interest to
America than the sympathy it excites. The vast and now unfruitful dis
trict on which tens of thousands are starving is the celebrated "black
earth" zone, formerly the seat of the highest cultivation. Its final reduction
to a desert is a calamity that forms a study for economists. This fertile
country in the heart of Russia has been destroyed by stripping off its forests.
Its fields were formerly interspersed by wide tracts of noble timber. The climate
waa mild and moist and agriculture flourished to such an extent that it was
the granary* of Russia. The forests have been destroyed and the land is no
longer fertile. It is interesting to know that this has occurred under com
munal ownership. There is no private land tenure there. The land belongs
to the village, the community, collectively. This communal ownership seems
to have rather accelerated than prevented the deforestation of the country
,and its return to desert. _ â¢ .
This Russian lesson should not be lost on California. The charms of our
climate and scenery and the fertility of our soil depend upon the perma
nence of the forests of the Sierra Nevadas. The last Legislature failed to
make any provision looking to the protection of these forests or to provide
for the obtaining of knowledge in the matter of storing the torrential
waters which run to waste in floods. To supply this lack of legislative in
terest the "Waters and Forests Society" has appointed Professor Davidson
as Irrigation Commissioner, to mass the information as to reservoirs and the
distribution of water stored In them, and has also appointed as a Forestry
Commission Professor Hilgard of Berkeley, Professor Dudley of Stanford,
Warren Olney Esq., Hon. Abbott Kinney and George Towle. These two
commissions will co-operate, respectively, with the hydrographic division of
the Geological Survey at Washington and with the forestry division of the
Agricultural Department. They will proceed exactly as though the Legisla
ture had authorized the Governor to commission them, and will report to
. the next Legislature the action necessary for the preservation of our forests
and the conservation of water. This is an imperatively needed undertaking
and the Waters and Forests Society should have the liberal support of the
public in carrying it out. '"*.â¢"* â¢
In sheep pastures the dandelion, parsley, yarrow, buttercup, worm
wood, narrow leaved plantain and fescue are all useful food, and some of
them necessary to keep sheep in health, though most of them are regarded
as weeds.
The Maryland Agricultural College announces by authority that every
bud in that State is destroyed by frost. *
Wholesome food is necessary for a hen if you want wholesome eggs. To
the majority of people an egg is an egg, but if a hen is fed on tainted food
she will lay a tainted egg. To prove the transmission of the condition of
the food to the egg just feed a hen onions for a day or two, and you will ?et
an onion-flavored egg.

STATE NOTES.
Major Chase of Cajon three years ago budded over 600 orange trees to
navels, and this y^tr his crop from them is 500 boxes, which we regard as
a quite remarkable return in so short a time.
The Visalia .Times says that Jasper Harrell is building four silos, each
holding 300 tons, to be filled with green alfalfa, corn or other green feed,
for use in th? dry or wet season for a dairy cow ration. If these silos
prove a success t he will build ten more next year.
Sonoma County has made April 14 arbor day, when the school children
will plant trees.
The Sonoma County hop crop for this year Is estimated at 17,000 bales,
as against 14,000 last year. t
There are 45,000 acres of olive orchards in California in bearing. '
Eastern peach growers reported last year a new pest, which they call
"little peach." The tree is not thrifty and- when the fruit is about an inch
in diameter growth ceases. Young trees recover,- but old ones die. The use
of wood ashes and stable manure on the soil is recommended. Does any
orchardist in California know of this apparently new disease?
AGAINST THE PANHANDLE SCHEME.
To the Editor of The Call: There seems to be an Idea extant that be
cause we have had some rain, and now have a fairly good outlook for a
prosperous season, we must necessarily go ahead and ornament the
city. While improvements are always in order, it is also as well to be
cautious or we may overdo something.
The golden harvest is not yet gathered, neither are the chickens count
ed, for the eggs are not yet laid.
Our city is beautiful with good natural advantages, and one of the finest
parks in the world. It is in the best location possible, warming or cool
ing the air as the season reauires. and purifying it at all times. But there
is a great deal to be done yet. For the park is still in its infancy.
To run the park downtown Into the business and residence district will
not only do the park no good, but will ruin many of the best homes in the
city. As a residence district there is none better than Oak-street hill. It
gets the sun if it shines anywhere. It is protected from the winds: the air
is pure and first-hand. The low lying fog is mostly absorbed by the
foliage of the park. - The sewerage is naturally of the best. It is conveni
entby car lines to all parts of the city and county.
The hill is as high as the dome of the City Hall, and too steep for
wheelmen to go up, hence they always go around. The same for vehicles
out for pleasure. People avoid the hill if they expect any pleasure from
a drive in the park with a fresh team. And to cut the hill down is out of
the question.
In a cut made for my house I found serpentine nigger-head bowlders
fifteen feet in circumference, impossible to blast or break. They have to
be cut out with gads and chisels, more like masses of compressed cork
screws than any ordinary rock. If any cut is made the expenses must be
enormous and a great detriment to property on both sides, for a high
bank is always dangerous, besides placing the houses on high inaccessable
eminences. This would also necessitate a complete new sewer. system for
the whole district. Another expense of which this neighborhood has had
unpleasant experiences, in the notorious Fell street sewer. Now who is
going to derive any benefit from all this destruction of useful property? I
will tell- you. ...... -.'â â¢-. 'â¢â  :
First Ãeal estate dealers and others who have lots for sale at increased
rates, particularly property holders in the vicinity of Oak, Van Ness. Mar
ket and Eleventh streets, and those who are fortunate with a pull and
get their property rated at a large increase over its true value, as some
have already done.
Contractors and builders and their followers.
Thirdâ Those who will have the handling of the Phebe Hearst donation
for beautifying the city. . Â:''"
Fourth Those who can afford to drive out for pleasure, and less than
half a dozen drives out that way will settle it for them.
Fifthâ A few who live along the line will have a pleasant nearby pri
vate garden to walk In, less than 1 per cent of the people. And what
about the 99 per cent 'who have the burden of taxes to pay.
Now, according to. careful estimates by competent men the cost will not
be less than $9,000,000 and take ten years to complete it, and many of us
whose property has been rated at about half what it has cost us. must
have the bitter cud to chew. We have spent the best part of our lives
making comfortable and permanent homes for our families. To tear up
and move and re-establish as we now are will entail no end of worry
trouble, expense, wear, tear, time and breakage.
Why do this thing when there is such crying need for better school
facilities, larger and more sewers and paved streets and cheaper lights?
Straighten the crooked and open the blind streets and avenues. Make a
park around that "magnificent ruin known as the New City Hall. Extend
Market street to the sea. Make it a boulevard, bringing the whole county
into the city; It would cost less than the Panhandle.
Stop again and think. What if some property owners seriously object
to losing their homes. What "law's delays" and great expense and trouble
for both sides. Weigh well these and numerous ideas that must come un
before the park can come downtown.
There is a park on Hayes and Steiner streets, Alamo Square by name.
It is four blocks in si:!e. and scarcely a dozen patronize it a day. Buena
Vista Park wants improving, also in the same district.
Even with plain clothing, how* much better if one is clean inside, but
how different even if covered with silks and jewels, if foul filth is below
and. inside. The same witn this tat city, it needs considerable internal
cleaning before it is covered with ornaments. Yours M. H. LOGAN. .

morning and take her on a trip to Sac
ramento. Not appearing at the appointed
hour she went to the Lick House to in
quire for him and was there informed
that he was dead.
A peculiar fact in connection with the
death of Gates is that he held two poli
cies of insurance, each for $5000. one a
life policy payable to his sister. Miss Al
ice Gates or San Rafael, and the other an
accident policy, payable to Ida Kleinhaus.
The jury returned a verdict to the ef
fect that "the death of Gates was due to
an accident in turning off the gas, which
caused him to be asphyxiated.
Coroner Hill declined to sign the ver
dict until after he has had an opportunity
of Investigating the case more fully, he
having been informed yesterday that.
Gates was rather eccentric and flighty at
times. The Coroner had no knowledge
at the time as to the condition of the gas
fixtures in the room in which Gates was
asphyxiated, this being a highly impor
tant point in relation to the issue as to
whether Gates committed suicide or
whether his death was accidental. In jus
tice to the insurance companies the Coro
ner will withhold his approval of the ver
dict until a thorough investigation shall
have been made.

TO BE POSTPONED
New Plans for the Park Pan
handle Extension.
Proposition Will Not Be Submitted to the
People Until December Engineers â¢
and Appraisers Selected,
THE question of voting bonds for the
extension of the park panhandle, the
building of a new City and County
Hospital, and the making of other
public improvements will not be sub
mitted to the people until near the close
of the present year. This much was de
cided on to all Intents and purposes yes
terday afternoon when the property-own
ers of the panhandle and the Mission dis
tricts met with the Street Committee of
the Board of Supervisors to discuss the
question of the proposed bond issue.
After the details of the proposition had
been discussed at length it was decided
to bo impracticable to hold the special
election next month, as was the original
intention of the Board of Supervisors. So
many objections were raised by the prop
erty-owners as to the methods that have
been pursued up to the present time,
particularly as to the initial appraise
ment of the property in the panhandle
district, that a new method, satisfactory
alike to the property-owners and the
members of the board, was agreed upon.
This Is, in brief that competent ap
praisers, satisfactory to all parties con
cerned, shall be appointed to estimate thÂ«
value of the property necessary for the i
proposed park panhandle extension, and j
upon the estimate so obtained the amount |
of money necessary to be raised for this
improvement by bonding the city will
then be definitely known. Property-own
ers will also thus be given assurance that
their property will not be underestimated
in value. As it is at present many hold
ers of real estate feel assured that under
the preliminary appraisement made for
the beneiit of the board their property
will be practically confiscated. In addi
tion to this it has been decided to pre
pare plans, as required by law, for the
building of a City and County Hospital
and of such additional schoolhouscs a_
may be needed. Also that two competent
engineers, to be selected by the board,
will be appointed to prepare plans for a
.ewer system in those uistricts of tha
city where such improvements are need
ed, as well as for a main sewer outlet for
the Sunnyside and North Beach districts.
The engineers to be selected to perform
this work will probably bo Marsden Man
son and C. 1-. Grunsky.
All of this preliminary work will re
quire time, and it Is not thought it can
be performed in time to permit the sub
mission of the question to the voters be
fore next December, if all of the provis
ions of the law governing such elections
are complied with. .
When Chairman Aigeltinger called the
committee together yesterday after
noon there were present besides the
members of the committee and Mayor
Phelan about thirty residents of the
Mission and panhandle districts. Mayor
Phelan stated that the total appraise
ment of real estate values in the dis
trict to be embraced by the Park Pan
handle extension was $1.52.,767. The value
of the improvements on tills property was
estimated at J1.3-4.70.-.. This, he said, was
about double the assessed valuation.
Representatives of the Mission improve
ment clubs represented to the committee
that while the, were not opposed to the
Improvements contemplated by the pro
posed extension of the park panhandle
they believed the matter should not be
given precedence to needed and ncessary
expenditures for sewers and schools. It
was represented that if the Board of Su
pervisors carried out its expressed inten
tion to proceed with the calling of a spe
cial election for the park panhandle ex
tension and also for other improvements,
then thai the two questions be separated,
so as to give the people an opportunity
to decide the questions separately.
Attorney Matt Sullivan, representing
Archbishop Rlordan, protested against
the value fixed by an appraisement on a
piece of church property in the strip of
land proposed to be utilized. He said the
value of the property was $150,000, while
the appraisment fixed it at 155.000. He
thought that if other appraisements were
made on the mc basis, then the proposed
fund of $3,-00,000 would be wholly inade
quate for the purchase of the land needed
under condemnation proceedings. The
proper .nethod of procedure, he said, was
to appoint experts, make a proper and
satisfactory valuation of the property,
and then it would be definitely known
how much money was needed to purchase
the land necessary for the proposed ex
tension. ,oW-,.-. _V-
This View of the ease was also taken by
Attorney Joseph M. Rothchild, repre
senting property owners on Van Ness ave
nue. He thought that a practical and
definite valuation should be put on the
property before the people are asked to
vote a bond issue that may prove to be
Inadequate for the purchase of the prop
erty. He entered into a discussion with
Mayor Phelan on the question, and the
Mayor finally stated that he was in favor
of appointing competent appraisers so
that the Board of Supervisors would be
able to tell the people of the city exactly
what the proposed improvements will cost.
A. P. Van Duser spoke for Mission resi
dents and declared that he did not believe
the extension of the park panhandle would
be of value to the city at large and
thought it would only be of small value to
property owners Immediately on either
side of the panhandle.
J. H. Humphrey, representing the Prop
erty Owners' Protective Association of
the Panhandle District, an organization
but two days old. entered a vehement
protest against the Board of Supervisors
proceeding on the basis of the appraise
ment of property upon which the 53,500,000
estimate was based. He said that all of
the property had been underestimated in
value, and that in many instances the
value fixed on individual pieces of prop
erty was at least 50 per cent below its
market value. .'. *
Or. Logan, who owns a piece of prop
erty in the proposed panhandle district,
also protested against what he declared
to be a virtual confiscation of property
if the values fixed by the appraisement
on which the board is now proceeding
were followed.
The discussion finally resolved Itself
down to a point where all agreed that the
best interests of all parties would be
served if a new appraisement of the prop
erty were made by men satisfactory to
the property owners and the members of
the board, and that the whole matter be
postponed until such a time as the de
tails can be arranged in accordance with
law and the wishes of the people most
interested. This view of the case proved
to be satisfactory to the residents of the
Mission district, particularly so when
Mayor Phelan suggested the appointment
of Messrs. Manson and Grunsky to pro
pare plans for a sewer system where it
was needed. The- names of D. M. Gunn,
Gustave Umbsen and Mr. Harms of the
firm of Madison & Burke were suggested

on th.- proposed panhandle extension, has

COOPER COUNCIL ENTERTAINS.
Father Connolly Lectures on the **Es
t.-blishment of Christian Re
ligion."
Murphy's Hall in Ocean View was
crowded last night by the friends of
Cooper Council No. 310 of the Young
Men's Institute who flocked there to hear
the Rev. Father M. D. Connolly of St.
Paul's Church lecture. The subject of the
reverend father's discourse was "The Es
tablishment of the Christian Religion."
On this he dwelt at considerable length,
reviewing the early establishment of the
Christian religion from the days of the
Apostles down to the present period. The
discourse was listened to with marked
attention as the speaker passed over the
various ages during which the Catholic
church continued to build on the first
foundation laid by fathers of Christian
ity, until the present day, when the
christian religion is firmly established in
every portion of the globe.
The council for which the entertainment
â¢was given is known as Cooper Council of
Ocean View, and has among Its mem

BURGLARS ON THIRD STREET
Three Rifles Taken From a Gun
Store on Sunday Night.
Burglars have again brokeniinto the
little - gun store and repair shop I of
Charles Carr at 350V_ Third street.- The ;
burglary was committed last Sunday
night and the thieves broke into the place
by prying open the rear entrance. Upon
the return of Mr. Carr he found that
they had taken away three rifles and j
would no doubt have taken more, but
were probably frightened-* way. On the
occasion of the previous entrance of the
premises the proprietor was asleep in the
rear room, the entrance- being effected by
prying open the lock of the front door. .
Carr at one time was one of the best
revolver shots on the coast, and when he
saw the thieves getting' ready to cart off
the contents of his store he opened fire
upon them through a crack in the wall.
The big 45-callber weapon he used j
alarmed the whole neighborhood and the
thieves escaped. One of the three was
seen going down the street leaning upon
the shoulder of a companion, but the po
lice never got on the track of the rascals. :
The last burglary has been reported to ;
the police. 1

Transports Arrive at Honolulu â
tain Holmes Once More in Fort.
Is Hale and Hearty as of
Yore.
The Pacific Mail Company's overdue
steamers Rio de Janeiro and San Jose ar
rived in port early yesterday morning.
The Rio came from the Orient via Hono
lulu and brought thirty cabin, sixteen
second cabin and 171 Chinese steerage
passengers. The San Jose came from
Central American ports and brought up
eight cabin and seven steerage passengers
and two Chinese in transit to Hongkong.
The Rio left -Yokohama on March 25, and
was delayed in the run to Honolulu by a
heavy northerly swell. At Honolulu she
was detained through not being able to
get to her dock on account of the trans
ports. â¢ ':..'â¢ ..-'.j- v
The City of Puebla, which left here on
March 24 for Manila, reached Honolulu
on March 31. The Cleveland left here
March 20 and made the run in eleven
days. The Zealandla arrived at Hono
lulu April _, making the run in seven
days. The Charles Nelson, which left
here on March 30, had not arrived at Ho
nolulu when the Rio left. '/ . v
One of the San Jose's passengers was
burled at sea in latitude 29 degrees 10 min
utes north, longitude 116 degrees 38 min
utes west. He was a German named Ga
briel C. Holtz, and he was taken aboard
from the German ship Dorothea at Aca
pulco. Holtz was suffering from heart
disease when he boarded the ship and
died from that ailment. He was coming
to San Francisco for treatment.
The San Jose brings the news that
there is some doubt about the safety of
the Pacific Mall Company's wrecked
steamer Starbuck. When the Peru left
her the Starbuck* was resting In a safe
position and the tug Isabel was to tow
her to Panama for temporary repairs.
On the way up the coast the San Jose
passed the Isabel, but she did not have
the Starbuck in tow. The supposition is
that the tug was returning to Panama
for wrecking appliances.
The Charmer once more made port yes
terday. Captain Holmes is looking hale
and hearty and shows no trace of his
sixty years of service in the mercantile
marine. The Only thing that breaks the
captain's heart la that his ship made a
long voyage. The Charmer was 151 days
from Philadelphia, and Captain Holmes
has made the voyage in her in elghtv
eight days. During the voyage B. Nich
olson, the carpenter, was taken sick.
Nothing in particular seemed to be the'
matter, but he gradually wasted away.
Everything possible was done for him
and Captain Holmes thought he would
live to reach port. On the Sth inst. Nich
olson took a turn for the worse and died
almost in sight of land. He was buried
at sea.
The Vallejo steamer Monticello is hav
ing new boilers put In and her pilot house
raised. With the house as it was the
captain was compelled to keep a man on
the lookout' on the hurricane deck aft.
The bark Merom, of the Alaska Pack
ers' fleet, palled for the canneries yester
day. . There was the usual crowd down
to see the fishermen off. A Mrs. Mc-
Gluick and Lars Larsen, carpenter of.
the bark, nearly lost their lives just be-'
fore the Merom got away. Mrs. Mc-
Gluick had been aboard bidding her
friends a final farewell, and the carpen
ter accompanied her to the gangplank
and started in to assist her ashore. The
Merom was standing high out of the wa
ter and the gangplank was very steep.
Mrs. McGluick led the way, but when
half-way down she slipped and fell. Lar
sen had hold of her hand, and the jerk
she gave caused him to lose his balance
and fall overboard. He forgot to let go
of her hand and she followed. Alongside
the Merom floated a' fender pile.
Larsen carromed against the side of; the
ship, then against the wharf and finally
landed astride the pile. Mrs.' McGluick
carromed against the wharf, , bounded
over against the side of the vessel and
landed on Larsen. Her weight caused
the pile to roll around, and both of them
went into the bay. They went down a
couple of times in their struggles, and
Mrs. McGluick's -Easter bonnet came off
and floated away on the ebb tide, much
to the disgust of Officer George Lake,
who yelled to Larsen:
"Save the bonnet! Save the bonnet!'*
"Save it yourself." said Larsen, as he
grabbed a rope thrown to him and was i
hauled on to the wharf.
A moment later â¢ Mrs. McGluick was !
landed beside him, little the worse for her. i

VESTRY REQUESTS
HIS RESIGNATION
Rev, H. E. Cooke, Rec
tor of Trinity Epis
copal Church,
the Victim, v
A TEAPOT tempest that until a few
days ago only simmered and siz
zled among the congregation of
Trinity Episcopal Church has now
developed into a raging storm. The
vestry of the church, of which Major
Hooper is senior warden, has requested
the resignation of Pastor Henry E.
Cooke, and many of the reverend gen
tleman's admirers have given vent to
their anger over the vestry's action by
giving up their pews. .'.â¢;;_'.'Â« '' - Â*
Everybody connected with the
church has been extremely reticent
about making any comments on the
unexpected action of the vestry, but
many prominent members of the con
gregation have arrayed themselves on â  ' .* u .
"the side of the preacher and have signified their intention of attesting their
loyalty to him to the bitter end. . _.- Â - ,
The exact reason for requesting the resignation of the ReV. Mr. Cooke
is withheld. In fact, the members of the vestry have gone so far as to deny
that they have requested their pastor to resign, but warm friends of tne
Rev. Mr. Cooke reluctantly admit that he has been literally forced from the
pulpit. The pastor has not as yet submitted his resignation to the vestry,
but he has already informed them that it will be forthcoming in a few
days The reverend gentleman is prepared to turn over his pulpit to his suc
cessor, who is said to be the Rev. H. S. Hanson, the present assistant rector.
When seen yesterday by a Call reporter the Rev. Mr. Cooke refused ab
solutely to say anything definite about the matter, nor was he inclined to
divulge any of" the facts that led up to the vestry's action. He expressed sin
cere sorrow that the affair was about to be given publicity, and stated that
his reason for refusing to be interviewed was that anything he might say in
connection with his resignation would reflect too much discredit upon the
When informed that many prominent members of the congregation had
already given up their pews in the church as a direct result of their pas
tor's forced resignation, the Rev. Mr. Cooke stated that he was extremely
sorry that such was the case. -Â£,<,'.;'
"It is purely a personal matter that has incited the vestry to request the
resignation of Mr. Cooke," said a prominent member of the congregation
when seen yesterday. "It was wholly unexpected, and has caused consid
erable feeling among certain elements In the congregation. Of course there
are two sides to every story, and this case is no exception to the general
rule There are many who commend the action of the vestry and many, who
believe that the Rev. Mr. Cooke has been unjustly dealt with. I am
not in a position to state the real reason why the resignation was re
quested It is simply a matter that affects those interested in the welfare of
the church. I understand that Mr. Cooke is prepared to accept the inev
itable, and to avoid creating any unpleasantness in the affairs of the church
he will step out gracefully."
The Trinity Episcopal Church is situated at the corner of Bush and
Cough streets and is probably the oldest and most prosperous of that de
nomination. The Rev. Mr. Cooke was appointed to the rectorship during
the month of February of last year.
Carl Muller filed a petition asking that
Mrs. T. A. Irwin be declared an involun
tary Insolvent, the act of insolvency be
ing alleged to be the giving by her of a
chattel mortgage to the Indianapolis Fur

BERKELEY, April 13.â The annual con
vention of the State Sunday School Asso
ciation,' which convened in this city yes
terday, came to a close at noon to-day. It
was acknowledged by all the delegates
present to have been the most successful
convention which the association has ever
held. Reports of the different officers and
committees showed that interest in Sun
day school work is growing throughout
the State and that religious instruction
for the children in the churches Is being
put on a sounder and more systematic
basis.
This morning's session consisted chiefly
of short addresses by experienced Sunday
school teachers upon subjects connected
with their line of work. The session was
well attended, the discussions following
each paper being a special feature.
Before adjourning the association elect
ed officers for the year as follows:
President. C. M. Campbell of Sacramento:
vice president, Ell Fisher of Salinas; field
worker and secretary. Earl S. Bingham of San
Jose; assistant secretary, Mrs. J. B. Miller of
Sacramento; statistical secretary. Miss F.
Harp of Stockton; treasurer, J. Letter of San
Jose; superintendent of home department. Rev.
George E. Dye of Willows; superintendent of
normal work and member of international ex
ecutive committee, H. Morton of San Jose.
A Double Trial.
The unusual scene of two juries sitting '
at the same time in the same court, each
having in its hands the fate of a defend- I
ant, was enacted in Judge Cook's court
yesterday morning. James Cooley and
James Wright were the defendants, both j
being charged with the same offense.
When the juries had been selected Judge j
Cook instructed one jury to concentrate
its energies upon the question o- the guilt I
or innocence of Cooley, and the other was
to determine the fate of Wright, the wit- ]
nesses all testifying regarding both de
fendants. The double trial then proceed
ed. After a short time the cases were
submitted.' and in a few minutes both
juries returned into the court and found
Coolev and Wright guilty as charged. Al
though it is believed the double trial es
tablishes a precedent, there is no reason j
to doubt the legality of it.

NEW YÂ£>RK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, April 13.â Local. transportation
and gas properties were advanced smartly to
day and retained about half the rise to the
end. Brooklyn Transit's strength was con
nected with Its purchases of the Kings County
elevated system. There tvere no new develop
ment to account for the rise in Manhattan and
Metropolitan. Assurances that adverse legis
lation was unlikely helDed Consolidated Gas
and Brooklyn Union Gas. Among other spe
cialties that were strong were S ugar and
Pressed Steel Car. The activity of specialties
caused the early weakness ln London to be
ignored and the Vanderbilt railways were
neglected until the afternoon, when renewed ac
tivity was at the expense of values. Some con
sidered the Samoan Incident as a bear argu
ment, but crop damage reports caused the
Grangers to be sold heavy. Important bull in
terests seemed to bid up their properties in the
afternoon, but were not heavy buyers to Judge
by appearances. The reactionary movement in
the railways cut down some advances ln special
issues. Including tobacco stocks. The selling
movement was In progress at the end, leaving
the market weak.
Call money in the late dealings ran up to the
legal figure, but later eased off to 4 per cent.
The public was Induced by the early advance
In' the specialties to take an Increased Inter
est In the market, which was reflected in the
volume of commission house business. The
more urgent demand of this character was sat
isfied fore the final hour, when there was
considerable professional realizing. The com
parative case of the monetary situation in
fluenced a return of investment orders in the
bond market, which caused an active demand
and higher prices for the gilt-edged issues.
Semi-speculative mortgages were taken for a
turn and the market was strong in many spots.
A feature of the trading was the increased
Inquiry' from out of town centers, but this de
mand was largely for middle grade securities.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 13.â circulation of crop
news of the most discouraging kind gave
wheat a strong start. The Price Current
weekly summary also had a considerable bull
influence, as It got over to the side of believers
in serious damage. Foreign buying orders for
I wheat were in the market at the beginning,
while domestic buying orders were more nu
merous than at any previous time since . crop
damage became the leading influence, and
many of these orders came from people In the
country' who had previously claimed there was
no material damage. These matters made
short sellers anxious. May wheat opened %Â®%c
higher at from 72%Â®73c, with principal sales
at 7-"Â» 4 anil advanced before noon to 73% c.
The market had a waiting spell ln the mid
dle of the session, during which May reacted
from 73% cto 73'ic, but the offerings were at
no time heavy and a fresh buying wave started
It up again. and a fresh buying May reached
up again. Before the close May reached
74%Â®74%c and closed with sellers at 74% c.
July rose from 72% cto 74% c, and was wanted
as the session ended at 74%@74%c.
Light receipts, large clearances and high
cables strengthened corn. The advance in
wheat also had considerable influence in stimu
lating speculative purchases. Eastern demand
j for cash com was good ln consequence of the
reduced rail freights. May corn closed %'a%c
higher. ; : ; -
| The demand for May options from shippers
who bought against cash sales was the main
cause of the improvement in oats. Favorable
weather and reports of seeding acted as a
drag to the July and September deliveries.
May oats closed %Â®%c higher.
Continued liquidation of May contracts weak
ened May provisions early. The bullishness of
wheat, however, caused some buying toward
the end and the loss was. more than recovered.
May pork closed 10c higher and lard and ribs
closed 2V_@6c higher. â  .-;- .- ;

LONDON WOOL TRADE.
LONDON, April 13.â Business in the wool
trade during the past week increased and
prices ruled firm at a hardening tendency. The
better nrices ' were due to further losses of
sheep In Australia owing to the drought, which
shortened the prospective supplies. Another
strengthening feature was the demand from
the Continent for merinos. Since the last auc
tion 2.00 bales have been sold, principally Aus
tralian and Cape of Good Hope and Natal
merinos at 6 per cent advance. The holding off
of sellers on account of the approaching sale
Is somewhat of a handicap to large transac
tions. â  rfÂ» .
A sale of sheepskins was held here to-day
and the offerings numbered 2SOO bales, all of
which were sold. There was an average at
tendance and a spirited demand at the opening
for merinos, which showed an advance of %Â®

at the r-ond day's session of the

"Some Underlying Meanings of Educa

Xad I ot Philadelphia!
:â¢ auditorium of Mission High School
presented a brilliant scene yesterday
morning. The teachers were out in force
attired in their best bib and tucker.
Some of the exhibits of the milliner's art
were wonderful creations, and for a time
the counter attraction threatened to seri
ously interfere with the object of th con
vention. But attract headgear rid all
other adornments of a personal character
were forgotten as soon as the daj 's pro
gramme was fairly begun and the teach
ers devoted themselves henceforth en
tirely to the business before them.
The session opened with chorus singing
by pupils from the ninth grade of the
Denman Grammar School under the di
rection of A. 1.. Mann, followed by a so
prano solo by Mrs. M. E. Blanchard. Pro
fessor Cubberly was then introduced. He
thought the teachers of San Franoisoo
should he congratulated on the progres
sive spirit they had shown in the face of
so many obstacles with which they have
had to contend in this city. He compared
the methods of teaching in vogue in an
cient times with the modern, system of
impart lng knowledge to the young and
dwelt upon the wonderful progress that
has been mad. in this respect during the
â¢last twenty years. In this connection he
said:
"Rabelais and Montaigne after him,
both famous in their day, protested
ug.-in.-t the parrot-like method of mem
orizing the classics, which was called edu

:â  r he said:
..What the people demand is one who
I a his whole he.art in his work.
The teacher who performs his or her work
in a manner to satisfy the conscience and
:. â¢ merely to draw a salary is the one
that deserves promotion. One' of the
things that distinguishes a good teacher
:: tn a bad one is the faculty of giving
pupils mental power instead of fact the
faculty of imparting the underlying
meaning of education." Continuing, the
professor said, in part: "It is but re
. *:ilyâ within the last twenty yearsâ
t .; the deeper meaning of education has
been realized In practice. Within the last
6Core of years manual 'raining has been
_:â¢ :erally introduced in the schools,- and
everything else is now subordinated to
training and development of the child
...- an individual. One of the most, valu
_:'olc.les-ions taught in the schools is the
training of our young men to overcome
difficulties. The energy and perseverance
acquired in school will enable a boy. or
girl to go much further in solving the
problems of life than if they never ac
quired them. The training in learning to
succeed in Euccess is of far more im
portance to the pupil than the acquisition
of specific knowledge in Latin, algebra
or history. If children learn this lesson
of success well, even though they learn
nothing else, their years in school will
have been well spent. The man or woman
is stimulated to fresh endeavor by. the
knowledge of past successes.
"We cannot afford to provide cheap
education for our youth. They must have
â  none but the best in order that our
fcchools may turn out good citizens as well
as good scholars. Every one should be
educated to form ideals, and that is one
of the purposes of education. It is those
men and women who have high ideals
who attain distinction in life. This mat
ter of ideals forms one of the bases of
our whole public school system and is one
cf the underlying principles of educational
work. We should also [m to inculcate
in the pupils independence of thought and
opinion. In the broad and general educa
tion of the younger generation lies the
salvation of popular government. This
1 think is the very highest form of pa
triotism which the public schools can
teach. The political tendencies of the age
emphasize selfishness and education in
the public schools should be directly in
opposition to this evil.
"No amount of education can make a
lazy man's labor equal to that of the
energetic man. Pupils should be given
a store of energy and ambition
for the future. They must develop
brains and energy ami grit "and pluck, and
the battle Is half won. Care should be
taken to prevent our boys and girls from
becoming self-seekers and to eliminate
any tendency toward selfishness."
"The end and aim of our educational svs
tern. said Professor Cubberly in conclu
sion, "is that our pupils be taught to
labor unselfishly; that they be trained to
toll and drudgeâ in a word, that they be
taught to live nobly as good citizens. If
these principles are adhered to the edu
cational system of the future will take
care of elf."
The sentiments expressed and the
truths enunciated by the professor were
heartily applauded by the teachers, and
at the conclusion of the address he was
warmly congratulated by Superintendent
Webster.
The Philomel Quartet sang several se
lections and then Superintendent Kirk
was introduced to present "Some
Thoughts for the Teaching Force of the
State to Consider."
"Th- educational problem is constantly
presenting new phases," said the laker.
"The teacher of to-day may realize that
some practices, once valued, are now rele
gated to the educational garret, while
others, once discarded, are coming back,
such as mental arithmetic, spelling, vocal
training and mental imposition. The
thoughtful teacher may realize that the
failure of some plans was not due to the
plans themselves, but to the lack of har
mony with the pedagogic system. The
progressive teacher Is reading and think
ing on educational matters. The world
If aroused and the thinking, pondering
and investigating of educational prob
lems goes on unceasingly. Only those
teachers who realize the Importance of
keeping abreast of the times .-an* hope
' to maintain their places in the ranks of
educators. You teachers of San Fran
cisco, enjoying tically a life tenure,
are under an obligation to make your
selves the best teachers for the positions
you .occupy Only on this ground can you
be justified -holding a monopoly on 'the

Superintendent Kirk expressed surprise
at the action of the Legislature in re-
I fusing to pass an appropriation for the
county boards of education. He declared i
the services of these boards could not I
well be dispensed with, but yet the nor- j
mal schools must be trained for the '
proper training of teachers. He re- j
marked that certain County Superintend
ents had gone to Sacramento to lobby for
the continuance of the annual examina
tions for teachers' certificates, their ex
cuse being that the training and normal .
schools were not competent to turn out i
the teachers that are necessary.
"As we have four normal schools and i
a pedagogical department in the Univer
sity of California," said the speaker, "I I
think we can dispense with the annual :
teachers' examinations. There is no I
longer any great demand for new teach
ers. There are more than a thousand
competent teachers In the State at the
present time without schools.
"The teachers' interest should be mani
fested to a greater extent In public affairs
and it; the attempt to purify politics. Who
can fail to admire President Jordan ant-
Professor Moses for the interest they take
in public affairs? While we may not fully
agree with President Jordan in his views
touching the Philippines, yet we cannot
but admire his bold stand in stepping
out of the sphere of the scholar to dis
cuss these affairs of statecraft and poll
tics. I am not alarmed at the attitude of
the masses toward educational work, yet
readjustment on some lines may be neces
sary. We cannot progress on the educa
tional road unless the people are following
us. We must educate the masses to the
standpoint of the educational system and
not let our Ideals drop back to the Ideals
of the masses."
After a recess of five minutes and more
music by the quartet Professor Tadd
delivered an interesting lecture along the
same lines as his first lecture in the Girls'
High School on Wednesday evening. Yes
terday, however, he had six pupils at the
blackboard to aid him in demonstrating
his ambidextrous theory. Professor
Tadd holds that the object of all educa
tion is the development of that character
istic which disposes to right action; that
experience, not memory, is the mother of
iaeas and that the universal process of
intelligence is the assimilation of con
crete material furnished by experience.
"What we want Is that action be spon
taneous and natural, and to obtain this
we have to form during the nascent pe
riod of childhood habits that will become
automatic," said the professor. "It seems
to me that this is more Important than
reading, writing and arithmetic. We
should give more time to something that
will expand and exalt the mind. We must
nourish the mind by getting ideas. 1 am
making a plea for a little more time to
be given to facts and forces, rather than
to the symbols of things, written words
and definitions."

OF YELLOW TAIL.
Foster's Attempts to Make Himself
Out the Real Owner of the
Horse Are Fully Ex
i plained.
The preliminary examination of Fred

taining money by false 'â  pretenses from
A. Howard, the Australian plunger, was
continued before Judge Conlan yesterday
morning. --. , , ~" /â '.'â¢'" .

agreement regarding the horses Yellow

tempt to slip in the words "and myself"
Into it. . i
Attorney Dunne, for the prosecution,
submitted a plan of the ground floor of
Howard's house, particularly the room
where the agreement referred to by Kauf
man was written. . ;â . .
James Hanby. a newspaper man con
nected with the Chicago Tribune, testi
fied to having discovered Yellow Tail, Sam
McKeever arid Abuse among other horses
in a box car about 800 yards from Foster's
barn, ready to be shipped, and to having
notified Howard of the fact. He ana
Howard then went to a Justice of the
ace and Howard swore to a warrant
for Foster's arrest.
A Howard, the complaining witness,
testified that he was a civil engineer by
1 profession. He met Foster for the first
time about the third week in January,
having been Introduced to him in witness*
house Subsequently be met Foster on
the racetrack, and after they became bet
ter acquainted Foster suggested to him
the buying of race horses and mentioned
the horse Frank Bell. He gave Foster
S"000 at the Safe Deposit vaults to pur

THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL, FKIDAY, APRIL 14, 1899.
Charles Thorpe, the jockey, had told him
that Yellow Tall was as 'fine a two-year
old as he had ever ridden. Foster repre
sented that he had made a bargain with
' Burns & Waterhouse to purchase Yellow
Tail for Howard and himself, but as
Burns was.' in Sacramento Waterhouse
would not close the deal without consult
ing him. Foster wired to Burns, who re
plied that if the deal was agreeable to
Waterhouse he was satisfied. Foster
showed the two telegrams to Howard, and
on the strength of Foster's representations
concerning Thorpe's statements and the
existence of the bargain with Burns &
waterhouse to purchase the horse for
$10,000 Howard gave Foster 19200. That
sum-added to the $2000 Foster already had
on the Frank Bell deal made $11,200, which
was $1200 more than the purchase price.
Howard made a demand upon Foster for
the $1200 and got back $1150.
Howard also testified that Foster told
him that the bill of sale for Yellow Tail
was in Howard's name and he would
bring it the next time he called. The bill
of sale was in Foster's name, and How
ard did not see it till it was produced in j
court on Tuesday. Howard also testified 1
that If he had not believed Foster's rep- :
resentations concerning the character of
the horse and the contract with Burns & j
horse and the contract with Burns &
Waterhouse he would never have paid
the money. He relied upon Foster's
statements, and the day when Foster re
ceived, the bulk of the money he was sick
in bed. He also told the story of the
execution of the agreement on March 1,
in which he was mentioned as the owner
of the horses, and explained it was writ
ten on Sunday, March 6, although dated
the previous day. The paper was entirely
written by Foster, who also made the
erasures. The way the erasures were
made was explained. After Foster had
written out the paper Howard looked at
it and saw the words "and myself?" He
remarked to Foster. "Where do you come
in?" and Foster replied, "I thought it
was agreed I would have an interest
when I got my money.'' and Howard re
torted that it would be time enough when
he got his money. Foster replied, "All
right, boss," scratched out the words "and
myself" and signed the paper.
The case was continued until to-mor
row, when Howard will be cross-ex
amined.
DRAWBACK CLAIMS FOR
SUGAR TO BE ALLOWED
EXPORTERS OF CANNED SWEETS
ARE JOYFUL.
Secretary of the Treasury Orders Pay
ment of the Claims for the Year's
1896 and 1897.
Customs Collector Jackson 'has received
a letter from the Secretary of the Treas
ury, dated April 7, which reads as follows:
The department duly received your let
ter of the 23d ult. submitting an applica
tion from W. Ford Thomas on behalf of
various claimants for drawback on im
ported sugar used In the preparation of
canned fruit exported under entries filed
during the years i y "i and 1897.
It appears that the liquidation of the en
tries in question was suspended on account
of the omission of the rates of drawback
prescribed for such canned fruit by sec
tions 12,892 and 1T.. 4"._.' from the list of rat-_
promulgated in section 17,355 of August l,
1896; that such omission and consequent
suspension of liquidation were deemed
necessary in view of the question which
arose some tirm- before the last-mentioned
date whether the Imported sugar so ap
peared In the exported article "that the
quantity or measure thereof may be ascer
tained," as required by the first proviso of
section 23 Of the act of August 28, 189. (re
produced in section 80 of the act of July
24, i^Ti. and that, Inasmuch as such ques
tion was decided In the affirmative. In ac
cordance with in opinion rendered by the
Attorney General under date of July i-">.
IS.", the rates of drawback specified in said
sections 12,392 and 16,452 were restored by
department's instruction to you of the 22d
of July last (section 19.721).
In view of the facts, the department con
curs.with you in the opinion that the
restoration of decisions sections 12,392 and
15.452 gives to the draw back claims filed In
compliance therewith the sate., status as
though said decisions had not been omitted
from the list of rates promulgated ln sec
tion 17.355. â 
You are, therefore, . authorized to liqui
date said claims accordingly.
Exporters of canned fruit and other
sweetened products are elated over the
decision embodied in the foregoing letter.
The payment of drawback on sugar ex
ported in canned fruit, etc., was discon
tinued after January I. 189fr. and resumed
on July 15, 1898. Bui a large number of
exporters, realizing that a change would
be made, kept account of the quantity of
sugar exported In the canned products
and filed claims for the drawback with
the (Secretary of the Treasury for 1896 and
1897. These claims will be paid immedi
ately and the exporters arc jubilant.

THOSE NOLAN
CHECKS MAY
RUIN NEALL
Not Sufficient Excuse
for Delay.
MORE DAMAGING TESTIMONY
DIVIDENDS WERE ALL DE
CLARED ON CASH ON HAND.
The Evidence of the Cavalry Officers
. Is Seriously Injuring the Pros
pects of the Accused
Officer.
As the court-martial of Lieutenant
Neall progresses it is becoming more and
more apparent that it is not so much
neglect of his accounts or the financial
tangle in which he found himself as it is
the explanation he made that will do him
the most damage. It looks as if he could
explain away most of the charges based
on shortages or at least account for his
actions to the satisfaction of a lenient
court; but the prosecution is proving its
charges of deception, unless the defense
can counteract the testimony of the offi
cers of his own regiment. C : ". ;- â 
Lieutenant Slavens, to whom fell the
duties laid down so summarily by Neall,
was under examination during the morn
ing session, and the evidence he gave did
little good for the accused.
He Bald the post exchange council would
not declare a dividend if there was no
money on hand, and he considered the
fact that dividends had been declared in
January and February as proof that
money had been on hand in sufficient
quantities to pay them all. It was the
duty of the post exchange officer to pay
these dividends at once. The council
meets every month, he said, and it is the
custom to settle the accounts at that
time. If there Is any surplus money a
dividend is at once declared. By refer
ence to the books Slavens testified that
on January 1, 1889, there was on hand
14982 86; on February 1 there was $-5545 05,
and on February 15 $4935 95. These
amounts were in cash. There was due
from the exchange on February 15 $3482 82
on various bills and an overdraft of
$154 12. The dividends for January and
February bad not been paid.
The reason for this delay had been ex
plained by Neall to the adjutant as being
.his inability to secure the indorsement
of the Nolan checks by Mrs. Nolan as
administratrix of her husband's estate,
and so the witness was led on to tell
about those disputed papers. The checks,
he said, could have been turned over to
him when the exchange was transferred
to him, -and be would have considered
them as assets. When he did get them
they had not been Indorsed and he se
cured the necessary indorsement without
trouble. When Neall had told him he
could not turn over the exchange until
the checks had been indorsed the witness
said he believed him, but later on, when
the transfer was still In abeyance, and
only because of those checks, he began
to suspect something was wrong.
"1 know now." continued the- witness,
"that the statement made to me by
Lieutenant Neall so far as the post ex
tftAnge was concerned and as influenced
by those particular checks was false. '
"Do you know the intent of ins state
ments?" asked the judge advocate.
"1 believe the Intention was to deceive
me and to prevent the execution of 'the
order detailing me as post exchange offi
cer, from the tact that he could not make
a showing of funds." â¢
The witness added further that he had
never seen any evidences of mental ina
bility on the part of N< all.
Mr Thornton then took up the cross
examinatlon, and under his question the
witness said- he had found all papers ac
counted for and none mutilated, and it
was possible to form a fair and accurate
statement of the financial condition of
the exchange. He was asked if there had
been a "showing of funds' at the rneet
inns of the council which declared the
dividends for January and February. He
said he presumed so, because it was re
quired by'the regulations. He refused to
admit that under such a supposition any
shortage that had occurred must have
occurred after the last showing of
funds" at the meeting in February, nor
would he say any more on the subject
than that the "showing of funds" ought
to have been made. The dividends he said
are declared on cash on hand, not on bills
receivable. v Â . , - ,
In conclusion the witness declared he
had been deceived by Neall in the reason
he gave for not turning over the ex
change lie would have receipted for
everything in sight had Neall seen lit to
turn the place over to him, and he be
lieved at first the reason Neall gave for
delay was to Neall good and sufficient
It was only afterward that he fouua It
was not. â __
William Conniff, post commissary ser
geant, was called to give some idea of the
financial condition of the- commissary de
partment When Neall turned it over to
Is successor, but his evidence was mainly
to corroborate what had gone before.
Captain Henry C. Danes, commanding
Battery 1. Third Artillery, was called to
tell that his battery had not received the
dividend for January nor the one for Feb
ruary from the post exchange. He said
be had never applied for It officially.
Captain John A. Lockwood, commanding
Troop M, Fourth Cavalry, testified to the
same state of affairs regarding his divi
dends. " Hi"
Captain Lockwood also testified that a
check he had sent to Neall as secretary
of the Presidio Club, amounting to $27 and
in payment for his January account, had
been turned over to Posner and Levin by
Neall and had by them been cashed at
the bank. He had received a second bill
for his January account In the latter part
of February and he had written to the
bank about the matter. The bank sent
the check back with the Information that
it had been presented and he sent the cor
respondence to the secretary who suc
ceeded Neall. By questions from the de
fense It was Implied that the firm receiv
ing the check had an account for cigars
with the club, and the check from Lock
wood had been turned over to it in part
payment.
Lock wood was a member of the post ex
change council when the January divi
dend was declared. He said the dividend
was declared on a showing of $2412 87, but
he was not asked if this was all in cash.

of its manager. The suit, however, is
but a preliminary proceeding to a crimi
nal prosecution to follow when certain
facts are established.
Bauer has been connected with the com
pany nearly fourteen years. He enjoyed
the Implicit confidence of Emil Boesch.
Its president, and was entrusted with the
responsibilities of the big business. About
one year ago the first whisperings of
his trusted clerk's dishonesty reached
Boesch's ears. He regarded them as false
and remained firm in his belief that his
confidence had not been misplaced. Later
further proof was brought to the presi
dent, and It was then that he entertained
his first doubt.
About eight months ago he left San
Francisco for Paris. Before his departure
he employed Attorney D. B. Richards to
investigate the conduct of Bauer and de
tect him in theft if possible. Richards
detailed several detectives to make pur
chases from Bauer. In each instance the
sleuths were given receipts for the
amount they paid, but no account was
placed in the books nor was the money
turned over to the firm. The attorney
also obtained proof that Bauer had
been systematical pilfering in this
manner day after day and when
ever the oportunity presented it
self. He sent his report to President
Boesch at Paris and the latter made ar
rangements to secretly return and take
his employe by surprise.
About two weeks ago Bauer was sum
moned to Richards' office. He was con
fronted with the proof of his guilt by the
attorney and, utterly off his guard, broke
down and confessed. He admitted having
taken a small amount and pleaded that
he be allowed to "square" the matter
with Borsch, whom he believed to be in
Paris. ills resignation was first demand
ed and after some reluctance he wrote it
out. Boesch, who was in an adjoining
room, then stepped in and another scene
occurred. The embezzler gave as an ex
cuse for his offense that his wife was
exceedingly penurious and would not even
allow him spending money. In order to
keep a few coins in his pocket, he said,
he was obliged to pilfer from the firm.
Boesch demanded tne whole truth, but
Bauer persisted that he had taken but a
few dollars.
The receipts obtained by the detectives
amount to a large sum. and this is the
only positive evidence against the ac
cused. Richards says that it would be
impossible to ascertain the correct
amount of the defalcations, as there has
been no complete record of sales kept, and
until Bauer consents to impart further
Information the exact loss to the firm
will remain unnamed. Bauer received $130
a month and dividends as manager and
Attorney Richards stated yesterday that
he believed him tp be worth between $40,
--000 and $50,000 at the present time. He
resides at 806 Hayes street. â¢'
The suit to recover the small amount
was instituted with the intention of forc
ing Bauer to give details under oath, af
ter which to prosecute him for embez
zlement. When first accused by Attorney
Richards he refused to resign, but was
given an alternative of immediate arrest.
Under these conditions he resigned. He
is about 52 years of age and. until bis
present difficulty, was always believed to
be a capable and honest employe. He
has a family and his sons were employed
by the lamp company.
Emil Boesch stated yesterday that he
believed the company had been robbed of
something in the neighborhood of $30,000
by Bauer. He would not discuss the mat
ter, but said that he will depend entirely
upon Attorney Richards for a settlement.
Bauer is at present fitting up a store
on Mission street, in which he will con
duct a lamp business. He admitted hav
ing taken money, but said his position in
the firm warranted him in doing so, as
he had "worked faithfully in its interest
for the past fifteen years." He asserts
that the charges are made against him at
this time to injure his trade, as he will
compete with tne Boesch Lamp Company.
Attorney Richards says that Boesch will
prevent Bauer from conducting his busi
ness until his alleged indebtedness to his
company is settled.
Probably a Murder.
E. Lane, a sailor boarding-house keeper,
called at the Coroner's office yesterday
and stated that he had been informed
that the sailor, William Brennecke, who
died In the Harbor Hospital last Wednes
day night of a fractured skull, was the
victim of a murder. He said that when the
body was seen lying in front of a Scandi
navian saloon on Jackson street two sail
ors were seen running away and that he
had found a sailor who claimed to be an
eye-witness to the affair and that Bren
necke was clubbed on the head until his
skull was broken and he was rendered un
conscious.
The matter has been reported to the
police. -
An autopsy by Dr. Zabala, held last
night, showed that a small piece of wood
was lodged in the fracture of the skull.
To Restrict Japanese Immigration.
W. M. Rice. United States Commis
sioner of Immigration at Victoria, B. C,
arrived on the steamer Rio de Janeiro
yesterday from Japan. Mr. Rice has been
in the Orient for six months past, where
he was sent by this Government to study
the labor conditions of Japan, and the
probable dangers of a threatened influx
of Japanese Into the United States. He
will proceed immediately to Washington,
where he will Incorporate his views In a
report to the administration. As a result
of his Investigations on the subject it Is
likely that Congress Will take steps to
restrict the ' wholesale Immigration of
Japanese laborers and mechanics. .

itt's Proposition.
FOR MUNICIPAL OWNERSHIP
ELECTRIC WIRES SHOULD BE ON
ONE POLE LINE.
Favors the Appointment of an Elec
trical Expert Who Shall Have
Charge of All Work
Done.
Superintendent Hewitt of the Fire Alarm
and Police Telegraph has formulated a
plan for accommodating the wires of com
peting electric light companies. The plan
contemplates the establishment of the
nucleus of a plant to be owned by the city
and which may eventually be extended
and enlarged sufficiently to enable the city
to provide its own lights for streets and
public buildings. These plans were sub
mitted to the Street Lights Committee of
the Board of Supervisors yesterday by
Superintendent Hewitt in the following
communication:
SAX FRANCISCO. April 12. 1889.
Committee on Street Lights of the Board of
Supervisors Gentlemen: Pursuant to your re
quest for information concerning public light-
Ing 1 beg to submit the following:
Investigation shews that about 5000 poles to
be used exclusively for lighting purposes are
necessary to meet the present conditions.
Poles from 30 to 75 feet in length could be set
complete for service for about $115,000. These
would accommodate the several competing
companies and all public wires.
It Is suggested that a franchise be granted
for the erection of a standard pole line to
supersede all existing poles for lighting pur
poses, and that all companies furnishing light,
heat or power be compelled to occupy the
same, paying a fair and reasonable rental,
to be fixed In the terms of the franchise.
That at the expiration of ten years the
poles shall become the property of the city,
and sooner, if after the expiration of six
months the owner of the franchise falls to
provide and maintain the same in good order.
That the poles be erected to the satisfaction
of the superintendent of the fire alarm and
police telegraph, and under his supervision, and
that he determine the position on the poles of
all wires, public and private, and that when
directed by said superintendent the owner of

HAD A WIFE MORE
THAN THE LAW ALLOWS
JOHN GREEN CONVICTED OF
BIGAMY.
The Jury in the Case Thinks He
Should Have Extreme Mercy
of the Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
906 Broadway, April 13.
It required just fourteen minutes for a
Jury in Judge Hall's court this afternoon
to decide upon a verdict convicting John
Green of bigamy. He was recommended
to the mercy of the court.
The trial occupied the greater portion
of the day and attracted as spectators a
large coterie of friends of the parties in
volved. The. evidence showed that Green
married Miss Lizzie Lunnv on July 14
1892, by contract. At that time the latter
was but 13 years of age. They lived hap
pily together on Natoma street, San Fran
cisco, for live years and each year was
heralded by the advent of a little one.
About a year ago Green enlisted under the
first call for volunteers in the First Cali
fornia and was mustered out in the bat
tery. He had enlisted as a single man.
When his wife disclosed his true matri
monial status he was thrown into the
military prison, was court-martialed and
acquitted. On February 2 of this year he
married bis wife sister, Maggie Lunny
In this city. Then relatives took up the
cause of the abandoned wife. His arrest
followed.
The defense tried to establish the ille
gality of the first marriage, and the de
fendant took the stand In his own behalf
He based his belief of being single upon
the following agreement, which his ac
cuser, the lirst wife, had signed:
"ANGEL ISLAND, Cal.. Jan. 23. 18S-1
"I, John Green, and I, Lizzie Lunny, do
by agreement understood by both con
tracting parties, to wit:
"That I. Lizzie Lunny, do release all
claim I have and have had upon the chil
dren of both contracting parties, leaving
both In their father's care, and that i
Lizzie Lunny, do not hold him responsible
for my support, as this agreement makes
void all past obligations that we had en
tered into by contract as man and wife
and that I in future shall resume my
maiden name as Lizzie Lunny."
Green stated that his wife had told him
there was no necessity for a divorce and
that "as long as he would care for the
children It was all right; she did not care
fOr herself." --..â â¢â¢
At the preliminary hearing Green testi
fied, that he had suggested the foregoing
agreement; now he said his wife had first
suggest it.
Attorney Choynski also testified. He
was an officer in the battery of which de
fendant was a private, and he regarded
1:1s reputation for truth and honesty as
being good.
The arguments were brief, the instruc
tions to the jury oral, and the jury
promptly convicted Green, who will re
ceive his sentence next Wednesday.

JOINED HIS FRIEND
BEYOND THE GRAVE
OAKLAND, April 13.'â William Cadogan of 1414 Eighth avenue Is the sec
ond victim of a train accident at Thirteenth avenue over a month ago.
In March John Pelton, a conductor, was killed while crossing the
track, going to his home, which is next door to the Cadogan home.
When Pelton was taken home Cadogan, who is an old man, and has been
an Invalid for several years, received a severe shock at the sight of his dead
neighbor. For several weeks he has been at the point of death, and his ill
ness was aggravated first by the funeral, then by missing his friend coming
. home every evening to his children and finally by seeing the widow and
little girls move away, leaving vacant the house which a few weeks ago
contained one of the happiest families In Oakland.
These unhappy events proved too much for Cadogan, and yesterday he
was buried from his house adjoining the deserted cottage where the Pel
tons lived. _ : --yy
NO DESIRE TO
CLOSE SALOONS
ON SUNDAYS
Issue Stopped Prior
to Election.
ONE LICENSE IS HUNG 'UP
COMMITTEE GIVES A HINT OF
WHAT IS COMING.
The Present Ordinance Guarantees
Local Option, and in Future it
Will Be Faithfully Ob
served.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 13.
It- is already apparent that the new City
Council is at work. Perhaps the most
significant act it has yet undertaken is
that of the License Committee, which has
laid on the table an application for a
saloon license for the old Union Hotel on
Thirteenth avenue. President Rowe de
nounced the establishment very forcibly.
He said it was an objectionable place
with back doors and card rooms and un
worthy of a license. The matter will lie
on the table until a majority vote desires
that it be taken up.
Some faction is evidently interested in
trying to stir up trouble for the new Coun
cil in the matter of Sunday closing. It is
known that a request has been sent to
Los Angeles for a copy of the ordinance
providing for closing and an effort will be
made to have one introduced before the
Council. It is well known that prior to
the election there was an informal under
standing that if the Council would not un
dertake to reduce the present license the
temperance people would not agitate the
question of Sunday closing or prohibition,
it being agreed thai these periodical
movements worked more harm than good.
This understanding is still in force, and it
is not the temperance people who are
striving to upset it. It is a certain ele
ment bent on trying to disrupt the har
mony now existing in the city govern
ment. Referring to the matter this morn
ing the Mayor said:
"This is the time for us to get together
and 1 feel that it would be premature to
offer a new license ordinance until we are
ready for it. We have at present an ex
cellent liquor license. It Is, in fact, a lo
cal option measure, as no district need
have a saloon if the people of that dis
trict object to it. The trouble is that the
present ordinance has not been enforced
in the past, but it will be in the future.
The men in the saloon business are more
than satisfied with the prospect of clos
ing the keno games, which have been op
erated In some of these places to the det
riment of the character of more respect
able houses. 1 must repeat that so far
as I know the policy of the administration
is in opposition to any form of legislation
that will tend to drive the people of Oak
land apart."
Nearly all the Councilmen expressed
views similar to those of the Mayor and
should an ordinance upsetting present
conditions be Introduced It will probably
receive riot more than two votes.
FALSE CHARGE MADE
TURNER A MANAIC
ATTEMPTED TO MURDER HIS
MOTHER.
Joseph Turner Accused of Defaulting
Less Than Two Dollars Loses
His Reason.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
903 Broadway. April 13.
An ill-founded charge that he had de
faulted the petty sum of $I*s has wrecked
'< the mind of Joseph Turner Jr. and al
| most resulted In the brutal murder of bis
! defenseless mother.
Turner Is 18 years old and resided with
his parents and sister at 1015 Taylor ave
nue, Alameda. Until a few days ago he
was a trusted employe at Le Count Bros.'
wholesale stationery house In San Fran
cisco. According to the story given by
the father at the examination of his son
to-day, the latter was recently accused
of being short $1 85 In his accounts. The
books were Inspected and all was found
to be correct. Then the young man gave
hie accuser, another employe, a sound
trouncing, whereupon the firm dismissed
him from service.
His discharge so worried him that sick
ness came, and with It mental derange
ment. For several nights the elder Tur
ner sat up watching his son, but yester- â 
day the exhaustion resulted in a faint- I
ing spell. While the father was in this
condition the Insane son secured a base
ball bat, declaring that he Intended kill
ing his mother and sister. But for the
timely reviving of the father, who Inter
ceded, the women would have met death.
Then the young man's mania took an
other turn and he started In throwing
furniture and glassware through the win
dows. Finally he attempted to set fire
to the house.
He was brought to the Receiving Hos
pital to-day In a tightly closed carriage
and had to be strapped down. Drs. Bu
teau and Tisd.ile examined him and this
afternoon Judge Greene committed the
unfortunate young man to the asylum at
Napa.
The physicians are hopeful that Tur
ner's dementia will prove to be only tem
porary. .".'.*

PEACE DECLARED. I
The Forderer-Mackie Misunderstand
ing Amicably Sattled. .
ALAMEDA. April 13.â Chairman For
derer of the Board of City Trustees and
Trustee-elect Mackie have settled what
ever differences existed between them and !
have resolved to work in harmony in their
official positions for the best Interests of
the city.
"As soon as I read in The Call that Mr.
Mackie had extended the 'glad hand' and
I had refused It," said Mr. Forderer to a
Call correspondent, "I went direct to Mr.
Hackle's office and told him that if he
had extended his hand to me at any time
and I had not reciprocated it was purely :
an oversight on my part. We shook
hands on the spot and congratulated each I
other on our respective elections. We
concluded that .the 'glad hand* term, so
far as we were concerned, had been used j
THE SAIN FRAXCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 14, 1899.
by the public only In a figurative sense
and thus found its way Into the papers.
. "I admit that I probably said the things
I about Mr. Mackie credited to me, but we
are liable to pass many remarks during
tne heat of election that should be forgot
ten as soon as the smoke of battle blows
away."
In the same connection Mr. Mackie says
j that whatever personal feeling existed be
; tween himself and Mr. Forderer will not
be carried Into municipal affairs, and that
1 they will work together for Alameda's
j best interests. -,'.
COLLEGE ATHLETES TO
DANCE THE BALLET
A UNIVERSITY CIRCUS IN
PREPARATION.
Track Men and Football Heroes
Training to Play the Part of
Clowns and Acrobats.
BERKELEY, April 13.â The athletes of
the University of California are going to
give a circus. It is true that they never
attempted such a thing before, but that
] only means It will be the more interest
: ing. For years they have been contented
with the sober work of running round the
track and of smashing each other on the
gridiron in hope of wresting a victory
from the cardinal. This' dignified tradi
tion is going to be broken. Before the
end of the present term they will one and
all don a circus costume to act the clown
and buffoon for the amusement of their
friends.
It will be a circus in every respect, from
j sideshows down to peanuts and colored
! lemonade. Men who can do the 100-yard
dash In 10 2-5 seconds will leave off their
spikes to appear in the role of the fat j
lady, and gridiron veterans for whom no
line-up Is too strong to be bucked will \
exchange their mud-covered football suits
for the costume of the ballet. Nothing
will be spared to make the whole a thrill
ing entertainment.
The date set for the performance is
i Thursday afternoon, April 27. All college
exercises for the term close at noontime
the same day, the serious work of final
j examinations beginning the week follow
ing. The affair will come off in the open
'â¢ air within the inclosure of the cinder
track on the lower campus. Ample ac
commodations for an Immense crowd are
I being made.
The programme is to open with a grand \
â  spectacular entrance of the whole troupe, i
consisting of over one hundred perform- I
ers. Womble, the star end of last year's
football team; Hoffman, track captain,
: with Hussey, Conn, Kerfoot and Al ;
j Lean, are training for the tumbling clown
act. Howard Squires will appear as drum
I major. Bab roll, champion hammer
i thrower of the world; Al Lean, the U. C.
; trainer, and others will give exhibitions
I of heavy-weight lifting, boxing, wrestling ;
\ and club-swinging.
An amusing feature will be an all-nation i
footrace of one lap in costume. Entries ;
are announced as follows; Walsh, Eng
lish; Hinz, Japanese; Trefethen, Turk;
De Lashmutt, Chinese; Broughton, Zulu;
O'Toole. Irish; Seltz, Dutch; Squires, He
brew. A pursuit race by five ballet girls
1 is to be followed by a one mile relay race
i between the football and baseball teams.
In addition one or two turns from the
Orpheum are to go on the programme;
possibly a troupe of Japanese acrobats.
Two side shows have been provided for.
One Is a vaudeville performance, con
ducted by college talent. The other will
be in the" nature of a dime museum.
The committee in charge consists of Ir
win J. Muma (chairman), Roy Fryer,
Irving C. Allen, Milton J. Schwartz and
J. B. Southard.
! HOSPITAL FUND EXHAUSTED. i
No Money With Which to Purchase
Supplies for the Balance of the
Present Month.
There Is considerable agitation among
those officials connected with the govern
ment and conduct of the City and County
Hospital on account of the condition of
the funds available for the maintenance
of that Institution. Auditor Wells an
nounced yesterday that the demands al
ready made against the hospital fund for
April, when added to the amount required
to pay the salaries for the present month,
makes a total In excess of the money
available under the one-twelfth act. This
being the case it follow, that there will
be no money with which to pay for goods
considered necessary for the maintenance
of the hospital for the balance of the cur
rent month. Past experience has been a
costly teacher to the merchants and it Is
probable that they will refusee to further
honor requisitions for supplies unless they
are first assured that money to pay for
them will be forthcoming.
Diamond Thief at Work.
K. G. Schwartz, a jeweler at 502 Battery
Street, reported at police headquarters
yesterday that a sneak thief had stolen a
diamond ring from him. The man enter
ed his Btdfe Wednesday afternoon and
asked to look at some diamond rings.
Schwartz showed him a trayful, but he
did not feel satisfied with any of them
and Schwartz turned his hack to get an
other trayful. None of them suited him
and he left. After he had gone Schwartz
missed one of the rings from the first
trayful, which the thief had stolen while
his back was turned. The man Is de
scribed as about 27 years of age and 5 feet
10 inches tall.
Lucas Extortion Case.
The preliminary examination of A. 13.
Lucas, the private detective, on the
charge of attempted extortion was com
menced before Judge Mogan yesterday.
Attorney Aiken appeared for the defend
ant and asked for a week's continuance,
which the Judge refused, as the defend
ant had already been granted a week's
delay, and Aiken withdrew from the case
The Judge appointed ex-Judge Webb to
look after the defendant's Interests, and
James F. Turner, the complaining wit
ness, took the stand. He Identified the
threatening Iters sent him by Lucas and
the prosecution closed. The case was con
tinued until April 21.
Pioneers as Entertainers.
The Society of California Pioneers en
tertained its friends last night in its as
sembly hall. Pioneer building. The occa
sion was a regular dancing party of the

OFFICERS ARE
EXHORTED TO
BE VERY WISE
Warning of Police
Commission.
DRAW DOWNS FORBIDDEN
MAYOR SNOW TELLS WHAT IS
EXPECTED.
Something Will Drop Unless There
Be a Marked Change From
the Practices of the
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
\ 90S Broadway, April 13.
The sixty members of the Police De
partment were duly lectured for an hour
this afternoon on what the new admin
istration expects from them. Everybody
was present, from Chief Fletcher to the
newest special officer. Mayor Snow, City
Attorney Dow and City Engineer Clem
ent, members of the Police Commission,
reviewed the force and gave the advice.
Nothing very startling was said or done,
but the men were distinctly informed that
something different was expected from j
them from the service rendered to the j
city in the past. The subject of gambling
was taken up, and the Mayor related
some incidents that have come to his
knowledge which he thought did not show
sufficient interest on the part of the de
partment toward their suppression. He
said he wanted officers to 'so conduct
themselves that no one would suggest
they were getting a draw down.
Chief Fletcher has evidently had a little
talk with the Commissioners, for he also
intimated that some of the work of his ,
men had not been up to the standard that
will be expected of them in the future.
Mr. Dow, who recently made a little in- !
spection of gambling dens on his own ac
count, added a few words of admonition
and Mr. Clement, who is not an orator,
stated that the other Commissioners had j
voiced his sentiments. ,
There is a feeling of greater security j
among the members of the force to-night !
as the result of the afternoon lecture, for j
the members argue that if any changes
were to have been made they would have I
been carried out before the lecture, which I
was in effect putting each man on proba
tion before the new commission.

RAILROAD DECLARES
WAR ON THE PRESS
Independent Newspapers to Be
Attacked by the Company.
Southern Pacific Influence Inspired the Adoption of the
Anti=Cartoon and Signature Laws â A Cam=
paign to Protect Corruption.
_ . 'â â 'â¢ "-.':â â 'â 
WILLIAM SPROULE, freight
traffic manager of the South
ern Pacific Company, is in
deadly danger of disgrace
with his employers. lake the
infant terrible he has blurted out a
suggestion of facts of a secret cam
paign upon which the masters of the
railroad have entered and which they
ire nourishing toward a hoped-for suc
cess with all the energy that revenge
Inspires. In a moment of ill-advised
enthusiasm for the cause of his super
iors, Sproule reflected, in a few ap
parently idle words, the facts of a
scheme over which the managers of the
Southern Pacific Company have deeply
thought. It all happened on Wednes
day night at the annual banquet of the
Manufacturers' and Producers* Asso
ciation.
In the course of a brief address on
the relation between railroads and com
merce Sproule seized an opportunity to
denounce the newspapers. The allusion
to the press was uncalled for and many
of the two hundred merchants, pro
ducers and manufacturers who were
present were concerned to know what
provoked Sproule's remarks. Curiosity
did not end with the feast and yester
day gossip upon the subject was rife.
Gradually out of the mass of rumors,
conjectures and surmises the truth was
sifted.
The Southern Pacific Company lias
declared war upon the independent
newspapers of the State. William
F. Herrin, acting under orders from his
superiors, is in alliance with Governor
Gage to harass, cripple and if possible
crush the newspapers of California
which can neither be bought, betrayed
nor browbeaten. The proof of this
great conspiracy is absolute. The
Southern Pacific Company is deter
mined that it shall do as it pleases and
shell not be forced to exposure when
it commits evil. It is fixed in its pur
pose to control, without interference,
the politics and the policy, the com
merce and the trade of the State and in
this purpose the Southern Pacific Com
pany has the subservient support of
Governor Gage.
The plot is one of the most serious
ever concocted to injure the people of
the State. Already the schemers have
placed upon the statute bocks iniquitous
laws and plans are perfected to carry
these laws to the letter into effect. The
railroad authorities will not, if they can
help it. tolerate longer an honest and
effective expose and criticism of their
dishonest manipulations in California.
It is not a new gam.- of the railroad
people to seek to control the news
papers of the State. Some have been
bought by advertising contracts. The
proprietors of others have been gagged
with the promise of political honor.
Some sheets have been subsidized and
maintained at small cost. The railroad
has been in too many dishonorable
li tines, political and commercial, not
to have established a bureau of bribery
for the suppression of honest news
paper criticism.
All of this the people of California
know well, but now the railroad has
gone further. It has, with the assist
ance of a subservient Governor,
placed evil laws upon the statute
books, and with the great authority of
the State itself will seek to crush fear
less newspapers. The railroad company
was in a desperate mood when it took
this extraordinary step and decided to
give open battle to the press of Cali
fornia. This struggle was determined
upon during the last session of the
Legislature, when the Southern Pacific
Company sought by every means in its
power to elect its tool, Dan Burns, to
the United States Senate. As a matter
of course Governor Gage espoused the
cause of the railroad and its candi
date.
Everything was done for success, but
defeat, overwhelming and disgraceful,
came. When the contest was on and
failure threatened the plot was hatched.
During the Senatorial battle the South
ern Pacific Company suffered from just
newspaper condemnation more than
ever before. In the opinion of William
F. Herrin and his employers it was bad
enough to lose the election of one whose
servility could be commanded in the
Federal Senate, but it was worse to be
unmasked before the people of the
State as the greatest corrupting influ
ence against which decent people have
to contend in California.
The independent newspapers of this
city and of the State showed what the
railroad is in politics. Its bold attempts
to corrupt public men, its strange
power over the chief executive of ii.,.
State, its debauching, debasing inter
ference in public affairs, its manipu
lation of laws and law-makers, were all
exposed to public view, and the South
ern Pacific Company plotted revenge.
It has bought courts and commissions;
it has bribed legislators and Super
visors; it has made an.! unmade pub
lic men'; it has enacted, through its
tools, laws designed for its commercial
and political advantage. And when the
independent newspapers of tin- State
COUld not be bribed into silence the
Southern Pacific Company determined
that they should be crushed until they
no longer could be heard by the peo
ple whose interests were being defended
in the arraignment of railroad methods.
This is the new campaign of the South
ern Pacific Company. It is interesting
to review how the first steps in the plot
were taken and what now is the pur
pose of the manipulators.
William F. Herrin is a clever lawyer;
Henry T. Gage is a serviceable Gov
ernor. Herrin is credited with an abil
ity to draft bills favorable to Southern
Pacific interests. Gage is his own au
thority for the accusation that ho will
sign and has signed -unjust bills and in
flict upon others an injustice against
which he, if he were interested, would
protest.
When the defeat of Dan Burns for
United States Senator was happily as
sured two measures began to receive
prominence in the Legislature. One
was the anti-cartoon bill and the other
makes it compulsory for newspaper
writers to use their signatures in publi
cations. Both these measures were
aimed against the independent
press. Both were Inspired by the
Southern Pacific Company and both
were signed by Governor Gage. Under
these remarkable laws newspapers of
California will not be allowed to tell
the truth. By the provisions of these
curious statutes newspapers dare not
expose the dishonest act of an indi
vidual or of a corporation except in a
way that will destroy the effect of the
expose. Public abuses, of which the
Southern Pacilic Company is a monu
ment of shame, cannot be discussed,
criticized or "condemned without plac
ing the newspaper daring enough to
undertake the task in jeopardy of a
punishment provided by law. In this
way and with this weapon the Southern
Pacific Company has opened its cam
paign to kill independent newspapers.
The railroad company wants to elect
(its own United States Senators, its
mors, legislators, commissioners
and Supervisors. The great corpora
tion wants to be the political dictator
of the State and it wants no criticism
of its policy. It wants to fix rates and
tariffs, bleed farmers, merchants and
producers, rob municipalities of privi
leges that aggregate millions of dol
lars. More than this, the great corpo
ration wants to ride rough shod over
the rights of private people, plunder
and even kill them and then with cor
rupt laws, corrupt courts and corrupt
administrations escape unscathed from
a punishment of its gigantic abuses.
This is why the Southern Pacific
Company does not wish to see unre
stricted a publication of the truth.
The truth and not falsehood is what
the managers of the corporation fear,
so battle will be given to those that
dare tell the truth. "When the anti-car
toon bill and the signature bill were
advanced toward adoption in the Leg
islature shrewd men suspected that
something more than the personal
venom of a few discredited public of
ficials was behind the measures. When
Governor Gage with undue haste made
these measures laws there was a strong
suspicion that something more than
his personal spite Inspired his action.
The inspiration was in the yellow
building on Montgomery and Market
streets. The Southern Pacific Company
loves us friends and will protect them.
A bargain In bribery Is dangerous,
under the law, for the briber as well
as for the bribed. One need not over
tax his memory to remember that there
have been serviceable Governors in
this State If the Southern- Pacific
Company, in the exercise of its multi
tude of affairs, should ever have occa
sion to use a serviceable Governor, it
would be wise to possess the means to
protect such an official from honest,
public, newspaper criticism. Men
cease to be serviceable after they are
exposed in their rascality, and to pro
tect itself the Southern Pacific Com
pany will try to protect rascals from
the lashing of an honest press.
While the railroad company has gone
very far in its campaign against an
independent press, it intends to go fur-
ther. It is generally understood that
the Southern Pacific Company will use
every possible influence to secure the
enforcement of the iniquitous measures
adopted and signed through railroad in
fluence. If suits be instituted the
Southern Pacific Company will give
secret assistance to those who bring
the actions. The battle promises to be
interesting â to the Southern Pacific
Company. It will be a contest to de
termine whether the people of the
State shall be the prey of every pow
erful criminal influence or whether the
press will be permitted to lash, with
the criticism of truth, some of the evil
energy out of such corporate malefac
tors as the Southern Pacific Company.
JOHN GWYNNE TO GET
LITTLE FOR A RING
SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY
DECIDES THE CASE.
Fifteen Dollars All That He Will Be
Allowed for a Diamond That
Was Lost in the Custom
House.
Customs Collector Jackson was notified
yesterday by Secretary of the Treasury
that John Gwynne of this city was en
titled to $15, the appraised value of a dia
mond ring which mysteriously disap
peared in the Custom-house and never
materialized.
More than a year ago the ring came
through the registered mail from
Gwynne's sister in Wales and was turned
ever to the customs authorities for ap
praisement. The ring was appraised at
$10 and a duty of $!â¢ was fixed. Then the
ring melted into space and Gwynne de
manded its value. He was offered $15
the appraised valuation, but refused to
accept it and appealed to the Secretary
of the Treasury, who ordered Special
Agents Linck and Smith to make an in
vestigation. As. a part of the evidence
the agents were shown a certificate from
a jeweler in Liverpool who had sot the
diamond in the ring. He certified that
the gem was a diamond of the first water
and that the ring was worth Â£21, or $105.
Gwynne testified before the special agents
that he had furnished the gold for the
ring and had paid $12 for the metal.
The special agents Induced Gwynne to
offer v. compromise on the payment of $50.
He accepted the offer, and a report of the
case was sent to the Secretary of the
Treasury.
Collector Jackson says that the Secre
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, APRIL 14, 1899.
tary cf the Treasury based his decision
upon the fact that the ring had been ap
praised at $15 and that the person who
registered the package in the mails had
indorsed it with a stipulation that the
sender would not hold the Postofflce au
thorities responsible for more than $15 in
case of loss.
Mr. Gwynne will receive the sum on
calling on the Collector.
"DOPED" AND ROBBED.
Mrs. Ernestine Thiers' Experience
With the Notorious Nellie Shar
key.
Nellie Sharkey, a notorious character.
was arraigned in Judge Slogan's court
yesterday on a charge of grand larceny
and the case was continued till to-mor
row.
The complaining witness is Mrs. Er
nestine Thiers, a waitress in a dance hall
on Eddy street: She stated that on the
morning of April 1 she went into the sa
loon at 14 Turk street with Tim Callan, a
saloon-keeper, and Buel Fountain, a clerk
in Whittier, Fuller & Co.'s, and met the
Sharkey woman. They had three drinks
and she feels sure that the last drink she
took was "doped." She felt sick and
drowsy, but as the effects of the "dope"
were not quick enough she was knocked
down, and when she recovered in the
Bancroft House, where she was taken,
she had been robbed of her two diamond
rings, $6 50 in coin and a valuable hat pin.
She though, an April fool's joke had
been played upon her at lirst. but when
she realized that she had been robbed she
notified Policemen Joy and Wilson and
they arrested Nellie Sharkey. They had
to get the assistance of three men to take
her to the City Prison, as she fought like
a demon. The two rings were found in
her possession.

TRAGIC DEATH
BY DROWNING
IN LAKE MERCED
Perished in Sight of
Friends.
-
WADED OUT INTO DEEP WATER
CLARA WOODS AND CATHERINE
WILLIAMS VICTIMS.
'
Little Joseph Farthing Saved a
Woman's Life at -the Risk of
His Ownâ Ending of
an Outing.
The treacherous bottom of Bake Merced
has claimed two more Catherine
Williams, _:: years of age, and Clara
Woods, her niece. 10 years of age.
One of the saddest of the long list of re
cent accidents occurred yesterday after
noon, when Miss Catherine Williams and
little Clara Woods sank to their death in
the chill waters of tile lake. 'They were
members of a party of picnickers, which
consisted of Mrs. R. H. Woods, mother
of Clara; Herbert Woods, live years of
age; Adelaide Woods, aged three; Joseph
Farthing, aged 12, and Mrs. Tuhbs. All
started out from tie- Woods home, 214
Borland street, at 10 o'clock yesterday
morning for a day in the fields.
They chose the picturesque grounds of
the Spring Valley Water Works at Ingle
sal,- as the scene. The morning was spent
in a search for wild flowers, and the chil
dren had a merry time of it, while the
older members of the party watched over
them. At noon they went down to what
is known as the east end of the North
Lake and partook of their luncheon. The
clear water sparkling in the sunshine of a
perfect day attracted the attention of the
little one.--, and they begged to be permit
ted to take off shoes and stockings and
paddle around in the water.
Everything looked safe. At the point
chosen there is a smooth, sandy beach
which slopes gently down, and the cov
eted permission was Anally given. A more
dangerous spot, however, could not have
been selected, as â¢ the arm of the lake
abounds with what is known as "spring
holes"â spots where the water suddenly
changes from a few inches to several feet
in dopthâ and it was one of these that cut
short the holiday and cast a sudden gloom
upon two homes. -
The children, as soon as the required
permission was given, rushed gladly into
the water and began playfully splashing
around. Suddenly a piercing shriek was
heard and Bertie Woods sank from sight,
ills sister, Clara, saw him go down and
hurried to his assistance, only to be
caught herself in the deathtrap. The
mother, Mrs. Williams, rushed into the
water and managed to clasp the boy's
hand and pull him out of danger. Once
she had her hand on her little daughter,
but was unable to catch a firm hold of
her and the little life was lost. In the
meanwhile Miss Williams had boldly
plunged into the water, but had got be
yond her depth and was struggling for
life.
Mrs. Woods carried the little boy safely
ashore and returned to make one more ef
fort to save Miss Williams and little
Clara. In so doing she almost sacrificed
her own life on the altar of devotion. She
got into deep water and was having a life
and death struggle when the hero of the
occasion manifested himself. He was
Joseph Farthing; a 12-year-old lad, who
lives at 1513 Baker street. He had already
done good service in aiding in the rescue
of little Bertie Woods, and when he saw
Mrs. Woods battling for life, with a
forethought and presence of mind worthy
an older head he picked up a leather strap
from the shore, swam out and managed to
throw one end of it to Mrs. Woods. This
in all probability saved her life. It does
not , take much to keep a human body
afloat in the water, but the little fellow's
endurance was taxed to the limit, and
before Mrs. Woods had managed to get
her feet on solid ground the boy had been
pulled under the water several times.
When he reached the shore he was al
most unconscious and vomited great
quantities of water. He was taken to a
house in the neighborhood and after his
clothes were dried sent home. All this
had taken but a very few minutes, and
while the struggle was going on in the
water a messenger was speeding to the
nearest house. He returned in a few mm- |
utes with Charles Dall. proprietor of the i
Bungalow House. Mr. Dall is an expert |
swimmer, and an his arrival took in the â 
situation at a glance. He dove down sev
eral times into the springhole at the spot J
where the struggling forms were last j
seen, but his search was fruitless. There
was some hopes that if he could bring the |
bodies to the surface a spark of life might j
remain in them. He remained in the wa- I
ter until blue with cold, and finally told
the sorrowful party on shore that their
relatives were beyond human aid. ;
Mrs. Woods still stood on the shore
shivering in her wet clothes and gazing
into the water where her loved ones had
disappeared. It had all happened so sud
denly that she could not realize they were
gone from her forever. Kind words of
sympathy and advice to go for her
health's sake and remove her wet clothes
fell on unheeding ears, and she was final
ly almost dragged from the spot.
Quite a party had collected by this
time. Mounted Policemen Leonard and
Kindly were early. on the scene and did
what little could be done for the living.
The Morgue was also notified, and the
grappling for the bodies begun.
A couple of lawn rakes were procured,
poles were lashed to the ends of them
and G. C. Kimball, William Buekel and
John Wiebe began dragging the water
from the shore. After a half-hour's work
Mr. Gardner brought out the body of
Miss Williams. It was already cold and
stiff, and all efforts to restore animation
proved futile. It was not until nearly
two hours later that Messrs. Buekel and
Wiebe recovered the body of little Ciara
and laid it beside her aunt on the smooth
sand which a few hours before i.ad
lured her on to her death.
Catherine Williams was 23 years of age
and a daughter of C. B. Williams, of the
firm of Williams & Woods', general con
tractors. Clara was about 10 years of
age and a daughter of R. H. Woods of
the same firm. She was an unusually
bright child and rather large for her
age.
The accident was not witnessed by any
one aside from the family party, and they
are all so unnerved that they scarcely
know how it happened. Each has a
slightly different version, but all agree
on the main factsâ that Bertie Woods
was first to fall in and that his sister and
aunt followed him.
('. D. Hyland, who has had charge of
the grounds for many years, said: "There
have been so many accidents out here
that I think people ought to keep away.
The bottom of. the lake is very treacher
ous, and aside from that, the mere knowl
edge of the fact that the water is used j
for drinking purposes should keep people
out of it. So sure as a hunter happens to ,
kill a duck he will plunge into the water
after it where it looks shallow, and if he
is not an expert swimmer the chances are
that he will never come back. I can re
call dozens of such cases in my time as
keeper of the lake. There are signs posted
up everywhere warning people to 4 keep out ;
of the water, but they pay no attention to ,
them.
"Mrs. Woods acknowledged to me that
she had noticed the signs but could not
deny her children the pleasure of a few
minutes' wading. These grounds were
closed to the public for a number of years
but it was almost impossible to keep them
out, as it is an ideal spot for a picnic and
wild flowers of all kinds abound. Addi
tional si.mis warning all to keep out of
the water were put up and the grounds
thrown open to the public and this is the
result. There are two mounted keepers
here all the time, but the stretch of
country we patrol is so large that it is
Impossible for us to watch the whole
lake. Whenever we find any one in the
water we at once order them off the
premises." .

NEPHEW HUNTINGTON
AGAIN STEPS DOWN
He Abdicates the First Vice Presi=
dency of the S. P. of California.
______________________
George Crocker Triumphantly Accepts Another Nicely
Gilded Brick From the Crafty Old President
of the Kentucky Corporation.
PURSUANT to that compact struck in
New York City in February last be
tween George C. Crocker, represent
ing the warring Crocker and Stan
ford interests, and C. P. Huntington, pres
ident of the Southern Pacific of Kentucky
and California and several other States,
Mr. Huntington yesterday smilingly prof
fered to Mr. Crocker another exquisitely
gilded brick in the resignation of Nephew
H. E. Huntington from the first vice pres
idency of the Southern Pacific Railroad
Company of California. Mr. Crocker ac
cepted with thanks and submitted to his
election to succeed his rival.
Just what has been given Mr. Crocker
in return for the absolute power he has
gladly laid at the feet of the crafty presi
dent of the corporation most of the courts
of the country have so far been unable to
discover. The Southern Pacific of Cali
fornia consists principally of its title and
incorporation papers. Its capital stock
to the last share is owned by the Southern
Pacific of Kentucky, a distinctly different
and independent organization. Every one
of its lines in this and other States is tied
up in the bourbon corporation, save the
eighty-mile narrow gauge road to Santa
Cruz and two or three other lines of even
lesser magnitude, which only operate
when the snow is light and little wind
blowing.
Of the dual corporation the Kentucky
company is the soul, if the Southern Pa
cific can be alleged to possess a soul, and
although it does not own a mile of track
or a stick of bridge timber, it owns the
stock and has absolute administration
over every dollar's worth of property the
Southern Pacific of California was incor
porated to protect. ::* - ;
In the Kentucky concern, Mr. Crocker,
by the deal of Thursday last, gained noth
ing, but H. E. Huntington's resignation
as assistant to the president and the
abolition of that position. He himself ad
vanced not a. peg, but remained as he has
been, second vice president. He gained
to himself no power nor the hope of any,
but merely ridded himself and the Stan
ford interests of a position and an of
ficial that were personally obnoxious.
By the resignation of H. E. Huntington
yesterday from the first vice presidency of
the California corporation. Mr. Crocker
gained that office and the active manage
ment when the elder Mr. Huntington is
in the East of about eighty miles of nar
row gauge track and its rolling stock.
In return for these two questionable
concessions Mr. Crocker has handed over
to Mr. Huntington absolute supremacy
of the entire Southern Pacific system to
be swung for a year at least to which
ever end the crafty head of that institu
tion may will It.
For a sop thrown to his vanity and per
sonal dislike he has given over to a man
who has time and again demonstrated
that he can use it to his own best ad
vantage the votes and influence that Mrs.
Stanford and his brother fought for years
to prevent C. P. Huntington from ac
quiring, and those faithful henchmen who
sit each year with bated breath waiting
their chief's annual arrival are rubbing
their hands out of pure joy for their
greatest victory so cheaply bought.
The compact made by Crocker in New
York carries with it the weight of Mrs.
Stanford's two directors' votes, and she,
more experienced in the wiles and ways
of the man who robbed her husband of
his presidency and then tried to steal his
good name, has sought to turn him from
a contract that would prove ruin before
aught else should come of it. To those
who are informed of the inner workings
of the big building on Market street the
conditions of the pact have been known
for weeks, and although Mrs. Stanford
and her advisers have argued with
Crocker and laid before him the fact that
C. P. Huntington only quits a fight when
he is not beaten, he has persisted in his
course, and the magnate's antagonists
have now lined up in a solid phalanx,
resolved to make the best of a bad bar
gain and, if possible, force him to extend
to Crocker his rights and privileges and
the same mede of power that he allowed
his ambitious nephew.
That Mr. Crocker has been a willing
victim to as clever a confidence game as
Huntington ever perpetrated is a fact too
patent for them to overlook, but it is too
late to get out of it, save by fighting it
through, and if possible winning for their
inexperienced leader the president's man
tle when he shall give up his faculties
to increasing age or be blotted entirely
from any but past considerations.
Nephew Huntington was designed by his
uncle as his successor and was consid
ered by him an apt and satisfactory pu
pil. At this late day in his expensive
training it is not likely that the astute
old man will give Up his fight to that end,
particularly when he has discovered how
much can be bought at so small a price.
As to his intentions with regard to the
administration of the Santa Cruz road
Mr. Crocker has as yet made nothing
public, but a statement is expected within
the next few days.
As a result of the meeting of the South
ern Pacific directors yesterday the list of.
officers of the California corporation is as
follows: C. P. Huntington, president;
George C. Crocker, first vice president;
Thohias 11. Hubbard, second vice presi
dent; N. T. Smith, treasurer, and J. L.
Willcutt, secretary.
NO CHANGE IN DIRECTORS.
Market-Street Railway Stockholders

The officials of the Southern Pacific and
Market Street Railway Company did lit

WORK OF THE GRAND JURY.
Ship-Owners Protest Against Charges
for Opening Fourth-Street
Drawbridge. T '
The Grand Jury has been asked to grant
ship owners relief from what they claim
to be extortion in the matter of charges j
made for vessels passing through the **%
Fourth street drawbridge after 6 o'clock
in the evening. The .bridge tender is paid
by the city to tend the drawbridge' dur
ing the hours of daylight. It has been
his practice heretoforce to charge a fee
of $4 for opening the draw for the pas
sage of vessels after the close of his stip
ulated hours of labor. A protest was
filed with the Board of Supervisors some
time ago, but it has received no atten
tion. Yesterday the members .of the firm
of the J. S. Kimball Company appeared
before the Grand Jury, and after stat
ing the facts of the case asked that some
action be taken to relieve shipping men
of this apparently unnecessary and un
called for tax on commerce. The mem
bers of the Grand Jury promised to in
vestigate the matter.
The Grand Jury has also been asked
to bring an indictment against Arthur J.
Sanchez, a young man who was arrested
some time ago on a charge of criminally
assaulting a little girl. The witness to
the alleged act testified before the jury
yesterday.
Violating Allotment Law.
Secretary Furuseth of the Coast Sea
man's Union appeared yesterday before
Shipping Commissioner Gwin with a sailor
named J. McDonald and complained that
John Savory and H. Brown, shipping mas
ters, had violated the allotment law. A
warrant was issued for their arrest.
