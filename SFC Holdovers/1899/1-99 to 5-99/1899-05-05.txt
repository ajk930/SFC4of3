GEORGETOWN, Ohio. May 4.â
Frederick Kautz of this city has
received a letter from Admiral
Kautz. his brother; at Samoa, in
which the admiral recounts some
of his recent official actions already
known to all the world. By way of
information for his brother the admiral
notes that tho Berlin treaty provided
that in case of the death of the King of
Samoa the Chief Justice should select
his successor. This the Chief Justice
did last August, when the King died,
selecting his son, M . toa Tanu.
A revolution was started January 1,
and ' the English and American Con
suls had to make a compromise and
a< ept a provisional government to stop
the war with Mataafa and thirteen
chiefs in charge, who v ere backed by
the German Consul General and his ad.
herents." Admiral Kautz then adds:
"*â *â  "When I came I said to the +
"*" American and English Con- â â¦â 
"*" suls: â¢You did this because *â¦*
"*" you were too weak to do any- *â¦"

SAMOAN REBELS
LOSE HEAVILY
Fearful Execution During the Shell- j
ing of Vailima. I
AUCKLAND. N. Z., May 4.â Advices I
received here from Apia, Samoa, to
April 25 state that the rebel loss by the |
shelling of the Mataafan stronghold at '
Vailima by the warships of Great Brit
ain and the United States was quite
heavy. Many of the rebels were
wounded. The house in which the late
Robert Louis Stevenson lived was rid- I
died with shot.
On April 22 there was a sharp skir
mish between rebels and Lieutenant R.
A. Gaunt's brigade near the town of
Vailima. In this engagement one Ma
taafan was killed. The lines of the
.friendlies were attacked in the dark
ness at two points, but none of them
was killed. On April 23 there was 1
some bush fighting. Lieutenant Gaunt's
brigade^ numbering 900 men, advanced j
under _ hot fire. The enemy lost sev
eral men, the bodies of the dead being
dragged away. Of the friendlies one i
was killed and three were wounded. The .
British lieutenants, Innes, Hickman,
Shuler and Heathcote, under Lieuten
ant Gaunt, led the loyalists.
The New Zealand Government i
steamer Tutanekai had arrived at j
Apia with dispatches announcing thej
request of the international commis- J
sioners that the inhabitants peacefully
await the arrival of the commissioners, i
who are now on their way to the islands I
from San Francisco. A meeting of the'
three Consuls, in view of this message,
was held, but without result, the Ger
man Consul dissenting from the propo
sitions of the other two Consuls. .'*_ >~~
Admiral Albert Kautz, U. S. N. and
Captain Stuart of the British cruiser
Tauranga dispatched a message
through a French priest to Ma
taafa, ordering him to withdraw his j
forces outside Of a line ten miles long
and six miles broad. Mataafa replied
defiantly, refusing to withdraw unless
the German Consul and the captain of
the German cruiser Falke agreed. Ad
miral Kautz and Captain Stuart then
sent an ultimatum to Mataafa, threat
ening to compel th*- withdrawal of his
forces. In support of this ultimatum a
plan of action was decided upon. Lieu
tenant Gaunt's brigade was strength
ened and a heavy gun was landed at
Mulinuu and war rockets were got in â¢
readiness. Being informed of these
prepositions Mataafa made prompt re
ply, agreeing to withdraw immediately.
On April 25 an important meeting of
the King and his chiefs was held. They
were informed of the action that had
been taken by the British and Ameri- '
can naval commanders and gave it
general approval.
Lieutenant Gaunt's brigade is now
patrolling the prescribed area. King

Special Dispatch to The Call.
MANILA, May 5, 8:25 a. m.
â In spite of the peaceful
overtures of their commissioners,
the Filipinos vigorously resisted
the advance of General Mac-
Arthur's division from Apalit
toward San Fernando, righting
desperately at long range after
running from trench to trench
when driven out by the Ameri
can artillery.
The movement upon San Tomas com
menced at 5:30 o'clock in the morning.
General Hale's brigade, consisting of
five Oatlings, under command of Ma
jor Young of the Sixth Artillery, two
battalions of the Fifty-first lowa regi
ment, the First Nebraska and the First
Dakota regiment, advanced along the
road a few miles west of the railway
line.
General Wheaton, with Hotchkiss and
Catlings, under the command of Lieu
tenant Naylor of the Utah Light Ar
tillery, mounted on handcars, pushed
ahead, the Twentieth Kansas and First
Montana regiments deploying to the
right and left when feasible.
The .try to be traversed proved
the worst yet encountered, mil'-.- of
formidable marshes and many unford
\ able streams delaying the advance ma
! terially.
Both brigades met with resistance =.-
I multaneously on approaching the river
! near San Tomas, which is about eight
j kilometers from Apalit. The center
j span of the railroad bridge had drop

strong trenches in front of General
Hale.
Although the attacking force poured
a very heavy artillery and musketry
j fire across the river the enemy stub
bornly resisted for over an hour, ulti
j mately breaking when Major Young
shelled their left flank and then re
i treating along the river bank under
I cover.
Genera] Wheaton, in the meantime,
I tried Ineffectually to draw the fire of
the Filipinos In the trenches east of
: the track.
As soon as they discovered that the
j nature of the country would permit
only a few skirmishes on each side of
the embankment the rebels regained
their courage and fought desperately
for three-quarters of an hour in the
face of .the American volleys and a
rapid-fire fusillade until outflanked by
the Montana regiment. Then a general '
scramble ensued, most of the enemy
boarding trains that were in readiness
and the others taking the road to San
Fernando, after burning the villages of
San Tomas and Monalin. About noon
General Wheaton crossed the broken
bridge, cleared the stragglers out of
the villages and advanced toward San
Fernando. General Hale effected a.
crossing simultaneously, after a slight
delay necessary to repair a stone
bridge.
Our loss up to that hour (noon) was j
two members of the Nebraska regiment
and one of the Montana killed, and
Captain Albrecht, three members of
the Kansas regiment, two of the Mon
tana, four of the Nebraska and one of
the South Dakota wounded. The ene
my's loss was very slight.
After a short rest the advance was '

tering the flrst series of intrenchments
near San Fernando. The rebels now
opened a hot fire.
Colonel Funston of the Twentieth
Kansas was wounded; one lieutenant
was killed and four wounded while
leading four companies of the Kansas
regiment to outflank the enemy.
General Hale pushed along the road,
flanking the trenches. More than a
hundred sick and wounded men from
General Lawton's brigade were
brought to Manila from Malolos by
last night's train. The heat is unbear
able.
The Filipinos retreated toward San
Isidro, and it is expected that they will
make a stand at Arayat, at which
place the whole of the rebel forces in
the province of Pampangas is con
centrating.
It is reported that, impressed by re
cent events, the Filipinos are wavering
in their allegiance to the insurrection
and are likely to assume a neutral at
titude.
It seems that General Antonio Luna's
forces are destined to destruction with
in a few days unless they surrender or
scatter. The American army has been
skillfully posted at points of iir.mer.se
strategic advantage. The insurgents
expected them to advance on Balinag
by way of Quingua, and had furrowed
the entire country beyond Quingua
with the strongest sort of intrench
ments. Instead of taking this course
General Mac Arthur swung toward San
Tomas, the route to which as almost
unprotected. and General Lawton
brought his brigade in against Balsuam
from the southeast, covering the line
of retreat of the rebels toward the
mountains and depriving them of a
refuge upon which they had already
counted.
Genera*! Lawton captured 50,000
bushels of rice, an important part of
the stores established by the rebels.
The Spanish commissioners have
made another futile attempt for the re
lief of the Spaniards held as prisoners
by the Filipinos. Their vessels steamed
to the port nearest Dagupan. Fearing
to land they sent a letter to Aguinaldo
saying they were authorized to ex
change 15,000 Filipinos for the Spanish
prisoners. The reply was received from
Senor Mabini. dated May 2, saying that
Aguinaldo was negotiating for peace,
pending which negotiations he could
not discuss the question of exchange of
prisoners.
AN ENGLISH VERSION
PROBABLY OVERDRAWN
VICTORIA. B. C, May 4.â Two Aus
tralian newspaper men. who arrived
here last night from the Orient by
the steamer Rio Jun Maruâ J. Rus
sell and G. S. Wittonâ gave the Times
the following account of their impres
sions of the American soldiers, their
present adversaries, and of the treat
ment meted out by the Americans tc
.the Filipinos: â¢
"The Americans,". Mr. Russell said,
"are treating the insurgents in a most
shameful manner. The sentries in
halting the unfortunates, do not warn
them. The general practice seems to
be to 'fire and then sing out.' "
A mistake was made during Mr. Rus
sell's stay which nearly cost an Ameri
can officer his lite. A captain, Mr. Rus
sell could not remember his name or
regiment, went out to his pickets and,
pursuant to the practice of firing and
then warning the comer, a sentry fired
at him as he approached in the gloom
and blew his chin off. Another step
and the unfortunate officer would have
been killed outright. _
"You never hear of these little Inci
dents over here," said Mr. Russell; "the
press censor goes through everything
the correspondents wish to send out
and the blue pencil obliterates all that
kind of thing. The Americans as a
rule have no love for the Filipinos and
if they had their way would summarily
shoot their captives. Of course there
is considerable to be said in excuse
of this bloodthirstiness. Several in
stances have been witnessed when a
band of insurgents came and parleyed
under a flag of truce with the Ameri
cans an/1 then treacherously hurled
spears at unarmed soldiers. But, all
things considered, it cannot be said
that the Filipinos are being treated
properly in the fighting. The Ameri
cans used Aguinaldo as a decoy when
the war was on with Spain, when his
trained. fighters who had so long fought
the Spaniards were of use to them and
then, to use the picturesque vernacular
of the United States soldiers, 'they
turn him down.' "
As for* the treatment of prisoners by
United States troops the following in
cident came under the ken of Mr. Rus
sell:
A reconnoitering party found three
insurgents just within the city trying
to creep out past the trenches and
seized them. One of the trio, a young,
and sturdy looking native, seemed to
be practically bleeding to death from
his wounds. The three were hurried
to the guardhouse and violently thrown
to the floor. Then their arms were
wrenched from them and they were
kicked around like curs. The prison
ers, expectant of instant death, com
posedly struggled to their knees and
chanted what seemed to be a prayer,
and then, springing up. bared their
bosoms and waited for the expected
blow. But it did not come. They were
hurled back into the guardhouse and
then they passed from the visitor's
view.
The soldiers of Uncle Sam in the
Philippines, according to Mr. Russell,
are homesick, and are thoroughly tired
of the' whole business. ... .
"Mark my words," said Mr. Russell,
"the United States has a bigger con
tract in the Philippines than they
thought they had and are liable to get
Into a hole before they get through
with it. The soldiers would welcome
any way that would give them a chance
to throw oft" their burden."
CROKER SAYS SELL
THE PHILIPPINES
LONDON, May 4.â 'What is the lat
est news the Herald has received from
the Philippines?" Richard Croker
asked, on the arrival of the steamship
New York at Southampton this morn
ing, and when I told him that negotia
tions for a cessation of hostilities were
still in progress, with some promise of
successful conclusion, he exclaimed
emphatically:
"Good; I am glad to hear that: but
we ought to get rid of the islands.
Spain did a good stroke of business for
herself in obtaining twenty millions
from the United States for them. They
were a continual drain on her. and I
think that we should either sell or
trade our rights in the island:, after
peace and order are restored. I do not
believe we ought to give away the
possessions the war brought us without
receiving something in return.
"I consider the scheme advocated by
the Herald for the exchange of the
Philippines for the British West Indies
a very good one, but England does not
appear to think it would be a good
trade for her. She has enough on her
hands in Africa. India and the Far
East without taking on more trouble
in the shape of the Philippines.
* "If we retain the islands and attempt
to govern them from a distance, the
question will figure very prominently
in the next Presidential election."

Special Dispatch to The Call
NEW YORK, May 4.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: Since it was announced that
the (Caucus Committee of Republican
representatives had agreed at Atlantic
City on a currency reform bill, which
is to be made a party measure if it
meets the approval of the Republican
members of the Senate Finance Com
mittee, there has been a revival of the
report that the President will call an
extra session of Congress. It is urged
that it would be good policy to have
an extra session, so as to get the House
organized promptly and have the cur
rency bill passed in o. ier that the
transition from the old system to new
might take place before the beginning
of the Presidential campaign.
It cannot be learned, however, that
the President has any intention at the
present time of calling an extra ses
sion. I am assured by party leaders
with wltom he has discussed the situ
ation that the President wishes to have
all the time possible before the meet
ing of Congress to restore order in the
Philippines and to decide upon his pol
icy for the future government of those
islands.
While it is recognized that It would
be well to have the new currency law
In operation before the campaign
opens, the disposition of the Republi
can leaders seems to be to try to get
it up and pass it in regular session
rather than to take it up in an extra
session.
The details of the agreement reached
by the Caucus Committee are carefully
guarded from the public on the theory
that It would be discourteous to mem
bers of the Senate Finance Committee
for the House committee to announce
its conclusions before submitting them
to the Senate. There is reason to be
lieve, however, that the committee
found It hard to reach any agreement
at all, and that the measure agreed
upon falls far short of being a com
prehensive scheme of currency and
banking reform.

REPUBLICANS
OPPOSED TO
ALL TRUSTS
The Party Will So Declare
! in Its Next National
Platform.
â â¢ â
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 4.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: Senator-elect Depews de
claration that the next .Republican
platform will undoubtedly contain a
declaration condemning trusts Is con
curred in by many Republican leaders.
- Representative Henderson of lowa,
who. If he Is not elected Speaker of the
House, will be chairman of the Judi
ciary Committee, to which any anti
trust bill would be referred, said to me
to-night that he had no doubt the Re
publican party would declare against
trusts in its next platform. He said
aggregations of capital engaged in va
rious industries were becoming so
enormous that they could not be ig
nored. Â»
A high official of the administration,
in discussing the trust question, said to
.me: "There is no doubt the platforms
of both great political parties will con
tain anti-trust declarations. I believe
the Democrats will make opposition to
trusts one of the principal planks in
their platform. They will denounce the
Republican party as friendly to trusts.
We will be ready to meet them on that
ground, however, and we will show by
the record of the party in the present
administration that everything possible
under the law has been done to re
strain trusts.
"It will be recognized that suits can
be brought when there is some proba
bility that the Government will win
them. We could go ahead and file suits
against every trust in the country, but
it would be pure demagogy to file suits
which the Attorney General would
know in advance would be thrown out
by the court, in view of its previous
decisions."

WELBURN IN
THE CLUTCH
OF THE LAW
Fugitive Ex Revenue Collector
Captured After Many
Months.
HE WAS MASQUERADING
AS A PRIVATE SOLDIER
En Route With His Company for the Philip
pines When the Federal Officers Found
Him at the Presidio Reser
vation.
OSCA M. WELBURN, ex-Collec- '
tor of Internal Revenue for the <
Northern District of California, '
for whom the Federal authorities ,
have been looking ever since his :
mysterious disappearance more than a
year ago, was arrested yesterday at ,
the Presidio, where he was shunning
publicity in the garb of a private in
I Company, Ninth Infantry. U. S. A.,
en route to the Philippines. He is now
in the County Jail, to* await trial on an j
indictment of thirty-one counts charg- I
ing him with failure, while acting as i
disbursing agent for the Government,
to turn over moneys collected by him. ,
The arrest of Welburn, under the ;
circumstances, was as complete a sur
prise to the authorities as it must have
been to the fugitive. After his sudden !
disappearance in December, 1597, the
Government seemed to be unable to [
find any trace of him. He had dropped I
completely "off the map" and what few !
efforts were made to overhaul him were j
looked upon as purely perfunctory.
From time to time rumors to the effect i
that he was in Mexico, in Texas and
Alaska were circulated, but he managed
to escape arrest, and had he not had the
hardihood to enlist, knowing as he must
that his regiment was likely at any
time to be ordered to San Francisco,
it Is not so certain that he would be
now occupying a prison cell.
Welburn, or as he is pleased to style
himself in the army. Olan H. Bedell, ar
rived in' the city last Friday night in
i company with others of a detachment of
thirty recruits sent here from Camp Haw
ley. Galveston, Tex., where he enlisted
April 22 last. The detachment stopped
the first night in town at the Interna
tional Hotel on Kearny street, and on the
next day, undoubtedly through Welburn's
curiosity to learn how things had been
going on at the Federal building since
his hasty departure, his identity was re
vealed to one who put the United States
Marshal on his track. This person was
William E. Davis, a colored man, whose
express wagon stood at the Appraiser's
building during all of the time that Wel
burn was in office.
Davis happened to be at the Interna
tional Hotel Saturday morning, when he
was approached by Welburn, who felt
sure that his closest friend would be un
able to recognize in the clean-shaven,
sun-browned, stalwart, blue-uniformed
Olan H. Bedell the ex-Collector of
Revenue wanted by Uncle Sam. That is
where he made his mistake. Davis had
not been talking to him more than a min
ute or two when the impression grew
strong on him that the infantryman was
none other than his former patron, Osca
M. Welburn. \
Davis lost no time in conveying this im
pression to the proper authorities. He
hurried to Bert H. : Thomas, special
revenue collector, and told him what he
knew. He said he could not be mistaken
ln the strongly marked features of the
former Collector. Thomas, in trun, re
ported the matter to United States Mar
shal Shine, who began the search for th.
man. Shine took with him to the Presidio
on Monday last Deputy Mofiltt because of
his acquaintance with Welburn. The two
officers were unable to locate their man
on Monday and met with no better suc
cess on Tuesday and Wednesday. They
were greatly Impeded In their search by
reason of the fact that there are about
1000 recruits at the Presidio, and at that
time they did not know the name under
which Welburn had enlisted. Finally
Marshal Shine went to Captain Hardin,
who* has command of the casual detach
ment, for assistance, and that officer sug
gested to him that he look over the de
scriptive lists of the recruits who had re
ported on Saturday, for that was the day
that the detachment which had stopped
at the International Hotel went out to
the Presidio. *,' '._]'
When Shine read the descriptive list of
Bedell he declared his belief that Bedell
was the man they wanted. This was yes
terday. Bedell had been assigned to Com
pany I. of the casual detachment, pend
ing assignment to some regular regiment,
PRICE FIVE CENTS.
| and was waiting transportation to the
I Philippines. Shortly after 2 o'clock yes
â  terday afternoon Company I came in from
drill. When fully twenty yards from the
i company Deputy Moffitt recognized "Be
' dell" as Welburn and declared that he
was the fugitive. When arrested the sol
, dier showed no surprise, but positively
1 declared that he was not the man the offi
cers sought. He said that he was Olan H.
Bedell of Alabama, and that he had en
listed in the army only a short while ago
; at Galveston, Texas.
Bedell's descriptive list â¢ shows that he
! was born in Auburn, Alabama, is 33 year*
' and 7 months old. His occupation is
! given as that of a laborer. His personal
, description is as follows: . Eyes, blue;
1 hair, dark, slightly gray; complexion,

fair: height. 5 feet 11*. inches. It shows
that Bedell enlisted at Camp Hawley.
Galveston, Texas, for three years, and
that he had seen no previous service.
The recruiting officer who enlisted him
is Second Lieutenant Ferguson of the
First Artillery. The descriptive list fur
ther shows that Bedell has a circular
pitted scar on the left knee and that he
has numerous moles on his back and
shoulders. On Monday Bedell drew his
allowance of clothing, and one noticeable
fact is that his signature for his clothes
bears no resemblance to the signature
upon the register of the International Ho
tel. The latter is that of a man unused
to writing and shows very little evidence
of education, while the former is a much
better specimen of chirography.
The men who came here with Bedell
from Texas declare that he never talked
of himself, and that they knew nothing
of his former history. They say that he
i was friendly and of pleasant address and
I that he was a good companion, but that
beyond this they knew nothing. Cor
; poral George Miller said that when Wel
burn came to the Presidio on Saturday
he told him he had enlisted last May in
the artillery. This, Miller declared, he
had since found to be untrue. Miller's
statement Is borne out by "Bedell's" de
scriptive list, which shows that the sol
dier had had no previous service.
One of the circumstances that convinced
Marshal Shine that Bedell was Welburn
was the fact that when he was examining
his descriptive lists Welburn's character
was given as excellent. This is only don.
in the case where a man about whom tho
recruiting officer knows nothing shows
himself to be possesed of more than or
dinary education and whose address and
general appearance is above the ordinary.
Although Bedell had only been in the
army since last month he has made an
excellent reputation for attention to duty
and general soldierly qualities.
As soon as possible after having made
the arrest Marshal Shine took Welburn
to the Appraiser's building, the prisoner
refusing to admit that he was any other
than what he seemedâ a private in tho
army. Going into the office of Marshal
Shine, however, he met face to face Shel
ley Monckton. one of the deputies.
"Hello. Shelley," he exclaimed. "Hel
lo." replied Monckton, "you're quite a
stranger.''
Welburn persisted in denying his Idea2

tlty to all who approached him during the I
afternoon. The news of his arrest had
spread through the building, and as many
Government employes as could get the |
leisure were on hand when the prisoner
was taken before Judge de Haven to lie!
identified a- the person called for in the I
warrant which had been sworn out by j
Marshal Shine. The courtroom was com- |
fertahly filled with men each of whom '
knew Welburn well and who had no diffi
culty in recognizing his well-known feat
ures under the tan of the recent exposure ,
to the sun. Some of them nodded to him I
and others approached to speak to him
and grasp him by the hand. Each and j
all of them he looked square in the eye (
without a glance of recognition, venturing
no remark to any greeting other than that
he did not know any of them and that I
they were mistaken in his identity.
This sort of reception was calculated to
shake the faith of even a Federal Vial
and several were not quite so certain that j
it was Welburn after all. Deputy Moffltt
was not one of these. He took th.' stand j
ar.d positively identified the prisoner as j
the man described in the warrant, and ;
that settled It. Welburn was taken back
to the Marshal's office, where he asked
leave to write a note. When he had tin- i
Ished it was handed to a district messen
ger, and the position that it was sent ,
to the son of the prisoner was confirmed
later in the day, win the boy called on j
his father at the County Jail. After that |
visit Welburn did not deny that he was t
the long-looked-for ex-Collector. He was j
asked if he persisted in denying that he. j
was Welburn, and replied:
"1 gue c s there is no dispute on that
point," Beyond this he refused to make
any statements.
While it would be Impossible to make a
mistake as to the identity of the prisoner,
once attention was called to him. those
who saw Welburn yesterday could not
help noticing the wonderful change that
had come over. the manner of the man
they once knew so well. He Is almost of
another mold, only the strongly marked
features being unmistakable, notwith
standing the fact that they are minus the
heard that graced the revenue collector
and that they are darkly tanned from ex
posure in a military camp. The blue eye
is unmistakable, as well as the long
lower jaw, while the bald spots that
marked Welburn as ma' years older
than the "Bedell" he claimed to be are
not to be concealed by the close hair crop
of the soldier. The life in camp has also
made a shapelier figure than that which
was so well known in the tenderloin in
Ihe halcyon days of Welburn's greatness.
It is above anything the figure of the sol
dier, erect, well knit, muscular and ac
tive, with all the gra*ce that mes from
attention to drill. The man looks many
years younger than he did in the days
of his trouble, but no one would say that |
he was as young as he entered himself in !
the army. He shows a number of years
more hat 33.
What Welburn has been doing with
himself is probably only known to him
self, although, judging from the ease
with which he had til? note conveyed to
the address of hi.- son it is more than
likely that the members of his family
have heard from time to time of his wan
dering
The fact that he enlisted is taken as
proof that he had little if any left of the
moneys that passed through his hands and
are said not to have been turned Into the
proper governmental channel. His phy-
sical condition shows also that he has
proceeded on a different career from that
he followed in this city before his down
fall. He shows all the evidence of having
led a sober life for months. He will need
the constitution he nas nursed since his
flight to enrry him through the trial he
will have to face.
The story of Welburn's downfall Is fa
miliar to every newspaper reader in the
State. The exposure came with t he sui
cide of Isaac Norton, who was his cashier
and who left .-> note saying that he was
short In his accounts to the extent of
many thousand dollars. This led to an
Investigation of the internal revenue of
fice and the subsequent indictment of
Welburn for embezzlement. He disap
peared before a warrant could be served
upon him and was not found for several
days afterward. He was brought to trial
and aft. many days a jury in the United
States District Court October 15, 1897,
brought in a verdict, of "not guilty."
Welburn was discharged, and while there
were rumoi*. that he would be indicted
for other alleged misdeeds in office, no
move was made against him. He must
have been satisfied, however, that danger
menaced, â¢ for he disappeared about
Christmas time of that year. Some days
after his flight the United States Grand
Jury brought in the indictment under
which he is now held.
Welburn's bondsmen were Daniel M.
Burns ar.d Thomas H. Williams, who had
gone surety for him In the sum of $40.
--000. Suit was begun against them some
time ago to recover the shortage in the
office made by the defalcation of Isaac
Norton. That suit has not yet come to
trial.
Welburn will be taken before United
States Commissioner Heacock this morn
ing, when the date of his preliminary
hearing will be set. The prisoner will
probably be represented by Frank H.
Gould, who defended him in his former
trouble.

So desperate is their position that
Alexander S. Brindle, the mall carrier

not venture on the crumbling, water
fnced ice. nd declared it suicide to at
tempt the trip.
The Information that Brindle gives is
that fully 200 men are confronting the
specter famine in the Dease Lake camp,
with not a dollar among them and their
supplies exhausted. The greater num
ber of the skeleton-like horses have
been killed and eaten, and when Brin
iile and McGregor started out the pack
mules were furnishing food for the
cheerless camp. This fare is varied
only by the occasional trapping of some

fines of the Indian villages.
A Hudson Bay post is 110 miles from
the scene of distress, and the request is

' Contested.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 4.â The East
triumphed to-day, for the scarlet colors
of A. H. & D. H. Morris were flrst under
tho wire ln the twenty-fifth Derby at
Churchill Downs this afternoon, and 25,000
people cheered the son of Bob Miles when
Taral rode into the semi-circle and sa
luted.
It could not be called a great race, for
the much-touted favorite won as he
pleased without an application of whip or
spur or even a shaking up. It was an
ideal day for the big event, and all Ken
tucky seemed to have turned out to do
honor to the occasion and incidentally
back their own judgment, for it was a
packed mass of humanity not only during
the Derby but from the call of the first
race to the close.
Long, before the noon hour people start
ed for Churchill Downs in smart traps
and traps of the antiquated kind, and
when the fourth, the Kentucky Derby, to
which many* thousands have been looking
j forward to with an interest thor-
I oughly characteristic of the Ken
| tuckian, every place of vantage
;in the stand and paddock had a
human occupant. The betting ring was a
, surging mass, and a down on a football
: Held was mild compared to the elbowing
those of a speculative turn had to en
counter in their efforts to place a bet.
The Derby was the fourth on the card,
and when the bugle sounded Mazo, Man
uel, .lis Lordship, Corsine and Fontain
hieau came out in the order named
and each was applauded, even Fontaln
] bleau, who was not friendless.
Starter Chlnn had little trouble in get
j ting them away, for on the first break the
flag went down and the struggle for the
i honors of the twenty-fifth Kentucky
Derby was on. They were all in motion
i and bunched when sent away, with Man
uel half a length to the good and Fontain
bleau second, the others well up. After
a few strides Turner took His Lordship
â â  to the front and cut out the running past
the stand and down to the turn. He was
leading by half a length when they
: straightened out for their run down the
backs! retell.
Manuel meanwhile had occupied a com
fortable position in third place, hut after
they had completed the first half mile of
the journey Tar..! took him to the front
and Boon had an advantage of half a
length, with His Lordship second, Cor
sine third, Mazo fourth and Fontainhieau
last-
As they rounded the turn into the
I stretch Corsine moved up to second and
j Tommy Burns began work on the winner
iof the California Derby. The son of Riley
was a half length behind Manuel when
they began the final run down the stretch,
with Mazo third. His Lordship fourth and
Fontainbleau bringing up the rear. These
positions were maintained down the
stretch and to the wire. Manuel winning
as he pleased the wire. Manuel winning
he pleased by a length without being
touched. It was but little more than a
work-out for Manuel.
W. Gallagher and the horse Patroon
were ruled off by the Louisville judges
this afternoon. Gallagher is part owner
and trainer of the horse and refused to
bring him to the post when ordered. It
was a selling race, and Gallagher was evi
dently afraid seme one would run the
horse up if he won or claim him if be lost.

LANGLEY'S NEW
FLYING MACHINE
Government Expert Has
It About Perfected.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. May 4.â A Washington
special to the World says: Professor S.
P. Langley, secretary of the Smithson
ian Institution and Government expert
on aerial navigation, will booh make a
trial experiment with his new flying
machine. This airship has been con
structed with the $25,000 appropriated
by the last Congress for the purpose of
experimenting with and developing fly
ing machines under the direction of the
War Department.
Professor Langley's new machine is
being built at Quantico, Va., a short
distance from Washington, on the Po
tomac River. He is working along the
same line in which he has achieved
much success in the past and has de
veloped a machine which has demon
strated its ability to navigate the air.
Professor Langley calls his machine an
aerodrome and it is purely a "flying
machine," that is. It is something much
heavier than air and entirely different
in principle from a balloon, which floats
only on air of its lightness, as a ship
does in water.
It is patterned after nature's flying
machines, birds, and only differs in
principle of action in that Instead of
being propelled by wings it gains and
maintains headway through the me
dium of a propeller fashioned on the
i order of a ship's screw.
Professor Langley has chartered the
steamer Bartholdi and will visit the
place where his ship is building within
the next few days. The experiments
will continue until the machine reaches
such a stage of perfection that it can
be publicly exhibited and inspected by
officers of the War Department. The
machine is ready now for its trial trips.
A CHICAGO WOMAN
KILLS HER MOTHER
Says She Was Driven to the Deed by

Act.
CHICAGO, . May 4.â Mrs. Augustus
Styles, after waiting two hours In a dark
recess of a hallway at the entrance to
Wallatt's Hall, Burlington street and
North avenue, this afternoon, shot and
killed her mother, Mrs. Catherine Schultz.
Mrs. Schultz was to attend a meeting of
the Martha Washington Prauen Verein,
which was held in the hall, and the
daughter lay In wait for her until she
came. Five shots were fired, three taking

Mrs. Styles, who is 35 years old. said
she was driven to the act by her mother
revealing a closed chapter of her early
life to Mrs. Styles' daughter, 16 years of
age. The child's parents were not regu
larly married, and Mrs. Schultz is said

child. The matricide has been arrested.
UNSATISFACTORY DECISION.
Omaha Kid Given the Verdict Over
Tommy Hogan of New York.
â¢ LOUISVILLE. Ky.. May 4.â Before a
house packed to the doors Oscar Gard- !
ncr, the renowned Omaha Kid, received
the decision over Tommy Hogan, the
crack New York feather-weight, to-night
in a 20-round bout given under the aus
pices of the Nonpareil Athletic Club.
The fighting was terrific from start to
finish. Gardner paid attention chiefly to
Hogan's stomach, and landed blows that
would have settled matters quickly with
a man less finely trained than the New
York lad. Hogan opened up an old wound
over Gardner's right eye, and the Kid
went to his corner time and again with
the blood pouring from his damaged op
tic. In the eighteenth round Hogan
drove his right on to Gardner's chin, the
bell saving Gardner from a knockout.
The decision of the referee, was not sanc
tioned by the majority of the spectators,
they believing that the contest should
have been declared a draw.
McXINLEY'S VACATION.
The President Going to Virginia Hot
Springs Next Week.
WASHINGTON, May 4.â President Mc-
Kinley decided to leave the city next
Monday, to remain away for two and pos
sibly three weeks. According to his pres
ent intention the President will spend his
vacation at Hot Springs, Va., as he is
suffering from a slight attack of rheuma
tism, and is feeling th.- strain that has
been on him for many months. He is anx
ious to enjoy perfect rest and at the same
time to avail himself of hot baths, which
will remove the rheumatic tendency. The
President and his wife will be domiciled
at the Homestead Hotel, as none of the
cottages at the springs are ready for oc
cupancy. The hot springs are only eight
hours' railroad ride from Washington, so
that the President could return at once
to the capital if any occasion arises fur
his presence here. .During his absence
the -id, 'at will transact only such busi
ness as absolutely requires his personal
attention.
PACIFIC CABLE SCHEME.
London Papers Blame the Govern-

LONDON, May '.âThe report of the Pa

to-day, shows that the committee has
recommended thai the proposed cable be
opened end operated by the Governments
of the colonies Interested, and that the
general direction should be in the hands
of a manager in London, under control of '
a small board upon which the associated
Governments should lie represented.
The morning papers blame the Govern
mentâthe Liberal organs severely and
the Ministerial journals mildlyâ for Its
lukewarm attitude ward the Pacific
cable. The Daily Mail reminds Mr. Cham
berlain. Secretary of State for the Colo
nies, that if the scheme collapses Ameri

the deficiency by continuing the Honolulu
cable to Australia, in which event the
benefits intended for Canada would be
diverted to the United States.

but the gun is still in the hands of the
rebels. Officials and leading residents
of Samoa who have been interviewed
united in saying that the charges
of inhumanity on the part of the Brit
ish which were made by a man named
Laroch are untrue.
A majority of the inhabitants are
highly dissatisfied with the cessation
of hostilities. They say that Mataafa
is beaten now and that the trouble
would be all ended in a week or ten
days were the advantage pushed. The
rebels are delighted at the delay, which
will give them time to refill their car
tridge shells and build more forts. It
is the general opinion that the islands
will be uninhabitable except for Ger
mans and Frenchmen unless Mataafa
and the rebel chiefs are -severely pun
ished :â :'-}
It is doubtful If British or American
subjects will give m..eh evidence before
the international commission, owing to
a fear that to express themselves can
didly would interfere with trade rela
tions. For this reason the evidence be
fore the commission is likejly to be
one-sided.
The statement by the German Minis
ter for Foreign Affairs, Baron yon Bue

elected King is denounced in Samoa.
The rebels admit that the result of
the battle at Vailima was the great

fire. They were also astonished at the
final shelling of Vailima, by which
many 'of the rebels were badly

FIERCE FIGHT
WITH BURGLARS
San Jose Man Puts Two
Robbers to Flight.
. c
ONE OF THEM BADLY HURT
â â¦- â
HIT ON THE HEAD WITH A
WATER PITCHER.
â¦
Made His Escape With the Assistance
of His Companion, but Left
a Broad Trail of
Blood.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN JOSE, May Architect F. D.
Wolfe, who resides at 651 South Sixth
street, had an exciting encounter with
burglars at his home about 2:30 o'clock
this morning. He broke a pitcher and
washbowl over a man's head and then
threw him clown a flight of stairs. Evi
dences of the struggle were plainly
seen this morning. The hall and stair
way were covered with broken crockery
and blood. Wounds were evidently in
flicted that may lead to the burglar's
capture.
The burglar was no less a personage
than "the borer," whose work in San
Jose for months has baffled the police
and terrorized timed women. His title
is derived from his effecting an en
trance into houses by cutting out
panels in doors with an auger.
Last night he had a partner with
him. A hole about four inches square
had been bored out of the front door.
Wolfe was awakened by some noise
and saw a man standing in the door
of the bedroom with a lighted candle
In his hand. The man shoved the
candle in his pocket and started down
stairs. Wolfe jumped out of bed and
started in pursuit. At the head of the
stairs he met another burglar coming
from a rear room. Wolfe grabbed a
water pitcher and broke it over the
fellow's head. This staggered him and
Wolfe followed up his advantage by
using the washbowl. The fellow reeled
like a drunken man and Wolfe then
threw the man down stairs. In falling
he broke the newel post at the bottom.
The burglar made his way out and dis
appeared. After daylight the man's
tracks were followed by means of blood
spots along the sidewalk. A couple of
blocks from the house it was evident
from the footprints that his companion
had joined him and helped him along
: The police followed the trail of blood
i down Reed street to Market and then
: along Market street to the center of
: town.
This afternoon drops of blood were
found leading out Julian street to
Coyote Creek, and a large number of
officers made a thorough search of the
creekbed. It is thought the man took
refuge there.
The lower part of Wolfe's house had
been ransacked, but nothing was taken.
Some silverware was passed by.
"The borer" has been operating in
San Jose for four months. In that time
no less than fifty houses have been en
tered. But little has been taken.

Opposes German's Peace Delegate.
LONDON, May s.â The Russian Gov
ernment, according to a dispatch to the
Daily News from Odessa, has addressed
a friendly protest to the German Govern
ment regarding the appointment as one
of Germany's delegates to the Peace Con
ference at The Hague of Professor yon
Stengel of Munich University, who just
prior to his appointment and again im
mediately after It, issued pamphlets de
j fending war and declaring that eternal

ture.
Need Not Advertise for Bids.
SAX ANDREAS, May 4.- -Judge Gotts
chalk to-day decided that the county gov
ernment act, as re-enacted in 1897, re
pealed section 3766 of the Political Code,
and that Boards of Supervisors are not
required to advertise for bids for. print
ing the delinquent tax list. The decision
was on an application for a writ of man
date by J. P. Snyder as attorney for C.
W. Getchell, proprietor of the Calaveras
Prospect, to compel them to advertise
for bids and to let the publication of the
list to the lowest bidder. The matter will
at once be taken to the Supreme Court.

MUST DIE ON
THE GALLOWS
Rev. Ceo. E. Morrison's
Sentence Affirmed.
ACTION OF TEXAS COURTS
â â¦- â
CONDEMNED MAN CONVICTED OF
POISONING HIS WIFE.
â¦
Formerly Lived in This State, Wher
He Married the Woman He
Murderedâ Cold-Blooded
Crime.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
AUSTIN, Tex.. May 4.â The Court of
Criminal Appeals here to-day affirmed
the death sentence of Rev. George E.
Morrison, who murdered his wife a few
months ago at Panhandle City, Texas,
by strychnine poison.
This is one of the most remarkable
murder cases in the criminal annals of
Texas. Rev. Mr. Morrison was born and
reared in Massachusetts, and his father
is a presiding elder of the Methodist
church in California. The condemned
man lived for some time in that State
and was married there to the woman
he afterward poisoned. They removed
to Panhandle City about four years ago
and Rev. Mr. Morrison was placed in
charge of the Methodist congregation.
He was held in high esteem by the peo
ple and his domestic life was apparent
ly happy.
A year or more ago he went to Kan
sas City, Mo., to undergo medical treat
ment. While there he met a young lady
who was one of his schoolmates in his
boyhood days, and to whom he had
been engaged before leaving his Mas
sachusetts home. The spark of love
was rekindled in the breast of the
Texas minister and without telling the
woman of his wife in Texas he began
paying her ardent attention. He told
her he was a wealthy cattleman and
had a large ranch in Texas. He re
turned to his wife in Panhandle City
in the course of a few weeks and pro
ceeded to carry on a correspondence
with his sweetheart, mailing his letters
from a neighboring town.
It is alleged in the statement of facts
in the case that the convicted man
carefully planned the murder. He
waited until the physicians in the town
were temporarily absent and then ad
ministered the fatal drug. Immediately
after the funeral Morrison left for
Kansas City. Suspicions were aroused
and the body was disinterred and an
analysis of the stomach revealed that
death was due to strychnine poison.
Morrison heard of the proceedings and
fled from Kansas City. He was pur
sued through several Western States
and Mexico and finally retraced to
Kansas City, where his arrest occurred.
On his person was found forged deed*?
to large ranch properties in Texas,
which he had used to make his intended
in Kansas City believe he was a man
of wealth. When his trial came off the
man's father wrote to the court offi
cials declining to aid his son for the
expressed reason that he believed him
guilty. The date of the hanging will
be set when the criminal court mandate
reaches the trial court.
ROHDER PREFERRED DEATH.
Henry Rohder. a canvasser for the sale
of bottled beer for J. H. Hall, agent for
the Fredericksburg Brewery, committed
suicide yesterday afternoon by shooting
himself with a pistol in the temple.
Rohder was driving Â«a bottled beer
wagon for Hall, and stopped at Barney
Farley's old resort on the Ingleside road
to solicit orders, as was his custom. He
was drunk, and when he asked the bar
tender whether he wanted any bottled
beer the latter replied that he might bring
in a case if he had not drunk it all him
self. Rohder, with the half-maudlin re
mark, "Lots of beer," stepped into Do
toilet and placing a pistol to his right
temple discharged it and fell dead upon
the floor.
His employer says that P.ohder had a
quarrel with his wife the evening previ
ous and went into the barn and slept
there. The dead man resided with his
wife and two children at 1539 Treat ave
nue, and was about 40 years old.
A Victim of the Chilkat.
EUREKA, May 4.â The body found near
Oil Creek yesterday has been identified
as that of E. J. Boland, a traveling job
printer, who was lost on the Chilkat. The
identification was made by laundry marks
on his drawers. Deceased came here from
Marysvllle and . worked on the Daily
Times for two months. He was a mem
! ber of the Typographical Union. He was an
American, aged about 13 years. This is
the second body recovered from thÂ©
wreck. The remains were interred at
Ferndalo this morning.SANTA FE
TO ENTER
THIS CITY
Freight Will Be Hauled
Through From Los An
geles by July 1.
NOTICE TO SHIPPERS
â * â
Early in August It Is Probable
Passenger Trains Will Be
Running.
Sreoial Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, May 4.â Shippers
have been formally notified that con
signments for through delivery upon
all Valley road stations as far north
as San Francisco will be received on
and after July 1. as the Santa Fe will
be prepared to haul freight in and out
of San Francisco over its own track
by the date given.
It was stated at Santa Fe headauar- I
ters to-day that passenger trains are |
to be run in and out of Los Angeles I
earlier than is generally expected. One i
authority gave ,â ,,. date as August 1"'. I
Tunnel work on the Valley road be- â 
tween San Francisco and Stockton is |
being rushed to completion and no time j
is ing lost in other branches of con- I
struct j
The story has been revived that as j
soon as the Santa Fe is running solid
trains between Chicago and the Pacific j
Coast, several â :' the genera] offices will j
l>e moved from Los Angeles to San j
Francisco. The general manager's I
office will, it is said, remain here, while
the legal and auditing departments !
may also stay where they are. The i
passenger and freight bureaus, how
ever, may be taken north for good.
The papers consolidating the South
ern California, Santa Fe Pacific and
Valley roads for operation under one
management have not been filed and i
will not be until after the end of the :
fiscal year, by which time President ,
Ripley will have returned to Chicaco
from Europe.
General Manager W. G. Net-in of the
Santa Fe Pacific, H. C. Whitehead,
general manager of the Santa Fe sys
tem. W. E. Bagley, auditor, and God
trey Holterhoff, treasurer of the South- I
crn California and Santa Fe Pacific,
leave to-night for San Francisco, where
they go to check up the accounts of
the Valley road, preparatory to the in
corporation of that line as part of the I
Santa Fe system.
_
There is much in the way of railroad j
business waiting upon the return from.
Europe of President F. *-*. Ripley of,
the Atchison. Topeka and Santa Fe. The
final consolidation of the Santa Fe with |
the San Joaquin Valley road and the rati- i
ticatlon of the deals by which the system I
acquires certain California franchises and I
trackage privileges from the Southern
Pacific and other local lines are matters';
all waiting his consideration.
Tho proposition of newest interest lo- j
cally, however, Is the proposed line of
trans-Paclflc steamers the company in-:
tends to operate In conjunction with its
transcontinental line. The announcement
that the Santa Fe would soon have es- \
tablished a San Francisco branch of its â 
shipping business came out from the East
a week ago in a dispatch carrying meager
details of the plan.
In the past few days, however, further i
particulars have drifted to the coast, and
the scheme is creating considerable talk
on the street. As far as the company's
plans are known, it is the intention to
start with but one steamer â of those
now building at the Cramps* shipyardsâ
to be run ln conjunction with the line now
plying between San Diego and Asiatic
points. The vessel will be put on about '
July 1. and others will follow it as busi
ness increases. It is not the intention of
the company to abandon its San Diego
terminal, as It has been a success in every
respect. The new line is to be a branch of :
that service and nothing more.
STANFORD TO HAVE A
COMPLETE LAW COURSE
Arrangements Perfected to Offer to
Students Thorough Prepara
tion for Practice.
STANFORD, May 4.â Hitherto the de
partment of law has attempted only to
give courses equivalent to the lirst year
work of the lust law schools; but it is
now possible and the time seems oppor
tune to begin complete law school work.
For the present the plan will be to have
three years' work In law, one of which
may be completer] by the undergraduate,
ami which will be required work for th*j
degree of bachelor Of arts in law. and the
other two years will be graduate work
leading to the degree of bachelor of laws,
The aim Is to offer to graduates of the
university the complete preparation for
practice which they have hitherto had to
seek elsewhere, and to provide the grad
uates of other universities a full law
course. The undergraduate work will be
so arranged that the undergraduate may
pursue it part 'of each year, beginning
â frith tha second ear in the university,
m- i l â¦ â¢ students entering the law depatt
ment from other universities will be able
a to take all the undergraduate work dur
' !np their lirst year in the department.
Next year the building which is at pres
ent used for a library will be occupied
entirely by the law department. It will
be subdivided Into suitable reception
rooms, offices and study rooms.
GERMAN SOLDIERS
LAND IN CHINA
It Is Believed They Propose to Oc-
cupy the Whole Province
of Shantung.
SEATTLE. May 4.-The steamship Rio
Jun Maru, which arrived this afternoon
from Japan and China, brings Oriental
newspapers of date as late as April 19
Telegrams from Peking and Shanghai
in the native Japanese papers give fur
ther particulars respecting the occupation
of Ichao by German troops. It appears
from one .if the Shanghai telegrams thai
two or three Germans were attacked by
bandits near hao and on March " i _
German force numbering 300 occupied Ji
sao district and marched to the village
where the Germans were assaulted. Th.'
Tsung LI Yarn.-!, has telegraphed Ins true
tions to the Chinese Minister in Berlin
to Inquire of the German Government
why troops have been landed in the
Slyintung province, south of Kiaochau
Bay.
A Peking telegram states that the Ger
man troops which proceeded to Ichao
numbered 120. Forces of the same
strength have been stationed at Jisao and
Among, making In all a force of 360. At
Shanghai the landing of these troops is
regarded as a step toward the occupation
il the whole province of Shantung.

GAGE DISPLEASES
LOS ANGELES MEN
LOS ANGELES, May 4.â While the
Republicans feel annoyed that- in
his sudden departure for the
north on Monday Governor
Henry T. Gage gave them the
slip, they are wholly unprepared for
the news that politicians who returned
from San Francisco to-day bring from
i the seat of war. The few who enjoyed
I the confidence of the executive express
surprise that the best portion of the
loaves and fishes are to be distributed
during the present council of the Re
publican leaders, and the select of Los
Angeles who one** stood high in party
confabs do not conceal their chagrin at
' being set aside.
"As the Governor holds daily con
sultations with Dan Burns we can only
hope," said a well-known leader of the
push to-day, "that after the colonel has
finally revised and approved the slate
the Governor may be permitted to pro
ceed to Sacramento and from that point
make public the list of the fortunate."
Frank P. Flint, who returned from
San Francisco to-day, says that he is
out of politics entirely and that nothing
, can induce him to re-enter the game.
â "1 saw Governor Gage surrounded by
j a drove of job-seekers," said Flint,
j and as the executive brushed his
i fingers through his locks he listened to
! the pleadings of those who asked for
j official crumbs."
The possibility of Dan Burns being
j appointed to fill the vacancy in the
| United States Senate received ad
| ditional strength to-day when it was
j stated Colonel Burns has received word
j from no less a Republican leader than
1 Senator Thomas ('. Piatt of New York
| to the effect that Matthew Stanley Quay
is to be seated as a Senator from Penn-*
! sylvania, and also that Burns can de
-1 pend upon obtaining a seat In the Sen
' ate, provided he secures a commission
! from the Governor of California.
Marcus A. Hanna is reported to have
i sent similar word to Burns, in addition
| to which the colonel has a letter from
j the private secretary of Senator Quay
! to the effect that a poll- of the Senate
1 has shown in advance that Quay is to
! be permitted to represent Pennsylvania
â  as a United States "Senator for at least
I another two years. The secretary re-
I ferred to is a son of J. B. Wright, Sur
veyor General of California, and he has,
therefore, added Interest in the situa
tion in this State.
LOST THE GEMS
AND THE GIRL
Why a Swell Wedding
Was Abandoned.
â 
â  â â¦ â â 
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PASADENA, May 4.â About two years
ago Miss Jessie Swope Staines met Sam
uel Healey Gilbert. A year ago they be
came engaged to be married. Young Gil
bert was only 19 and he had little or no
money, but his father had promised him
that when he desired to marry he would
give him a start in life. So when Gilbert
decided that Miss Staines, the pretty
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frederick
Bremba Staines, society people, living at
1070 South Orange Grove avenue, Pasade
na's swellest street, was the girl for him,
he gave her a handsome ring.
Gilbert went East a short time ago to
arrange for his marriage, which was to
take place Wednesday. April 26, at All
Saints' Episcopal Church, in this city. Mr.
and Mrs. Staines bad the invitations
printed and sent to their friends. Young
Gilbert, upon going to Evansville. Ind.,
found that his father had failed and
could not provide for his son.
Gilbert was at his wit's end. He saw
his bride slipping away from him; he
knew the invitations to the wedding were
in the hands of the printer. He had no
money, but he had an aunt, and the aunt
had some valuable diamonds. Gilbert was
tempted, yielded, took the diamond! and
set forth for Pasadena to be married. But
the theft was discovered and detectives
set out hotfoot for the diamond thief.
Gilbert was arrested at St. Louis and
confessed. But the family, fearing dis
grace, offered to let him off if he restored
the diamonds. This he did. His friends
came to his aid and he kept on to Pasa
dena, hoping to get here before the wed
ding invitations were issued; hoping too.
perhaps, to continue bis engagement even
If the wedding was postponed. But the
girl's father refused to permit his daugh
ter to marry the young man. The girl
abides by her father's decision and GU
bert has returned home single.
THE ENGAGEMENT
PLEASES BOTH SIDES
Washington Society All Agog Over
the Betrothal of Julia Dent
Grant.
WASHINGTON, May Much interest
j is manifested in Washington society over :
the engagement of Miss Julia Dent Grant,
j daughter of General and Mrs. Fred D
j Grant, to Prince Michel Cantacuzene of
I the Russian Imperial Guards. The name
] of Cantacuzene is one of the oldest in
'â  Russia and dates from the time of the I
Byzantine empire, when Constantinople
was the capital. The name is now a ]
i familiar one in Russia and Roumania.
! The father of the young Prince was di- :
rector of foreign religions to the Minister
of the Interior, as all faiths outside of
the Greek churchâ the established church !
of Russiaâ are included In the adminis
tration of the Interior Department.
Prince Cantacuzene, who has also the
title of Count Speranskiy, Is related on the
maternal side to the late Prince Gorts- j
chakoff, who a quarter of a century ago !
was the "Grand Old Man' of Russia,
being Grand Chancellor of Russia and
Minister of Foreign Relations. The fact
that the Cantacuxenes own an estate near
Moscow does not signify that they are
possessed of great wealth, for there is
one family in that country of vast domain
which owns 2,500,000 acres and is not re
garded as rich. The youthful Prince .is I
said to be unusually talented and dis
tinguished. Russians in Washington are
particularly pleased over the alliance, as
they regard Miss Grant as not only an
exceptionally beautiful young woman but
one whose character and loveliness of dis- !
position make her an ideal type of Ameri
can womanhood. *' _ _

BRIGGS' ORDINATION
WILL CAUSE TROUBLE
NEW YORK. May Clerical partisans
of Dr. Briggs in the controversy that has
arisen over his proposed elevation to the
Episcopal priesthood are coming forward
with offers of their churches for his ordi
nation. It was learned to-day that St.
Bartholomew's Church and St. Andrew's
Church have been offered to Bishop Pot
ter for the ordination service.
There is and has been since the be
ginning of the controversy a disposition
among the clergy to defer radical action,
pending a decisive movement by Bishop
Potter. As one clergyman said to-day
"The Bishop has this matter in his hands
and all we can do is wait until we hear
from him."
In spite of this, however, there is no
diminution in the intensity of the oppo
sition to Dr. Briggs' ordination: Prepar
ations for hostilities are being actively
pushed and the announcement .of the day
and place of ordination will be the signal
for an open declaration of war.
Eminent theologians nave been en
gaged for a week In an examination of
Dr. Briggs' famous work, and when the
occasion arises they will be prepared to
present properly formulated charges.
WANT BRIBERS' NAMES.
COLUMBUS. Ohio, May Virgil P.
Kline and M. F. Elliott, as attorneys for
the Standard Oil Company, filed in the
Supreme Court this evening a motion to
compel Attorney General Monnett to
make more specific the statement re
cently filed by him alleging that he had
been approached by persons offering
bribes if he would dismiss the suits
against the Standard Oil Company. The

TIDE TURNS IN
DREYFUS' FAVOR
Dupuy Canvasses Public
Sentiment in France.
Sl>eclal Dlepatcta to The Call.
NEW YORK, May 4.â dispatch to
the Commercial Advertiser from Lon-
don says: Following Constans' course
in the Boulanger episode, the Minister
of the Interior, M. Dupuy, has just ob
tained confidential . reports from pre
fects throughout France regarding the
condition of public opinion on the
Dreyfus evidence and the possible
course of the Court of Cassation and
the Government.
The weight of the reports is that ex
treme partisans on both sides remain
unmoved, but that the latest portions
of the evidence have much Impressed
the large and influential body of opin
ion which previously inclined toward
the staff and expected it would prove
its case against Dreyfus. Men of this
thinking have, from the first, been
open-minded and honest. As Lieuten
ant Colonel Henry's suicide persuaded
them to reopen the Dreyfus case, so
later evidence inclines them to a re
trial before a court-martial. The same
body of opinion is still more convinced
of the need of a- thorough reform of the
i general staff and the retirement, if not
punishment, of officers that blundered
and intruded in the Dreyfus affair.
The temper which these' reports Indi
cate prevails also in the Chambers,
though the moderates are less strong
there than outside. M. Dupuy is shap
ing his course accordingly, and there is
excellent reason to believe that two or
three weeks hence M. Ballot de Beaure
paire's report from the Court of Cassa
tion will recommend revision and re
trial, that the court, perhaps by a nar
row majority, will approve it, and that
all this will be done with the approval
and co-operation of the Government.
M. de Freycinet, furthermore, is pre
paring a plan of reorganization of the
i general, staff, particularly of the
: intelligence department. Influential
members of the military party, espe
; cially generals not smirched by Drey
fus intrigues, are meantime urging the
Government, for the sake of the whole
army, to punish the culprits as lightly
; and quietly as possible, and M. Dupuy,
I with characteristic opportunism, is
nursing a scheme by which such mild
action, with the rehabilitation of both
Dreyfus and Picquart, may square both
! sides.
GRAND ARMY VETERANS
HAVE A NARROW ESCAPE
Excursion Train Near San Diego
Saved From Destruction by a
Milkman.
SAN DIEGO, May 4.-Although the G.
A. R. encampment proper closed yester
day afternoon, many veterans are still
in the city. Two hundred of them went
by special train to-day . to Tia Juana.
There they were welcomed by the Mexi
can Judge Zaxueta, who addressed them
in English. On the return trip the G. A
R. special on the National City and Otay
i Railway had a narrow escape. A mile
, south of Sweetwater Junction an empty
! passenger train went through an open
switch. Nobody was hurt, but the train
! was partly wrecked. The G. A. R. special
was- only a- few minutes behind and a
i sharp curve shut out a view of the wreck.
I A milkman warned the engineer of the
special, which was coming at a rapid rate
and the train was stopped.
This evening several hundred of the
! veterans and other visitors were enter
| tamed at a banquet at the Second-street
! armory. Speeches were made by Past

WALLACE, Idaho, May i.â Troops
A and C, Fourth Cavalry, dismounted,
from Walla Walla and Boise, arrived
this evening. After a short halt here
both cavalry troops went direct to
Burke, arrests commencing immediate
ly. A squad was detailed as guard,
the balance of the men starting out.
As fast as men were found they were
brought to the guard and herded in the
streets. No information is given out,
but the expectations there are that prac
tically every man will be taken either
as a prisoner or a witness, his status
to be determined later. Many men
were taken in their beds. The day
shift at the Tiger mine were all taken
as they came from work. A special
train with troops left Burke at 7:30
p. m. with nearly every man in town,
twenty soldiers being left as guards.
The Mammoth, St "ird and Frisco
mines and the town of Gem will be
cleaned up while coming down the can
yon. The train left Burke with two
coaches and six box cars all loaded.
Mullan reports no arrests there to-day.
It is expected that arrests will com
mence there to-morrow. The moun
tains are full of fleein- men. With the
railroads all guarded the only safe way
out of the country is over the old
(Hidden road to Thompson Falls, Mont.
That route is lined with them. Some
take the road direct from Burke, while
others go by the way " Murray. The
road from there was ' _pt open nearly
all winter in hauling ore and is fairly
passable." Around Murray the fugi
tives also have the sympathy of a ma
jority of the people. This morning a
teamster met fifteen fugitives on that
road within six miles of here. This
afternoon the same man met fifteen
others. They acknowledged being Last
Chance men. but were frightened by
the report they had receiver! of troops
at Thompson Falls, and decided to
abandon the trip and are camping to
night at Monarch, three miles out.
They expressed themselves as feeling
had" that "hard working men should
be driven out of the country by sol
diers."
MARTIAL LAW IS
IN FULL FORCE
General Merriam in Person TaH-s
Command of Troops at
Wardner.
WARDNER, Idaho, May 4.â Four
hundred United States troops are on
guard to-night in the Coeur d'Alene
mining district and martial law is in
full force in Shoshone County, idaho.
While the Governor's proclamation, is
sued yesterday, has not been posted in
a public place citizens are aware that
martial law is. in force by reason of
the fact that United States troops are
on the ground to see that it is carried
out.
Brigadier General H. C. Merriam, who
arrived to-day from Denver by way of
Boise, has determined, if possible, to
arrest all those implicated in blowing
up the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mills.
While it is known that several of the
mob, fearing arrest, have escaped from
Shoshone County, a large majority of
those wanted are still within the
county.
General Merriam has been busy all
day sending dispatches throughout the
mining district, disposing of the troops
so as to protect property and shut off
the escape of those suspected of assist
ing in the lawless acts here last Sat
urday. Every avenue of escape from
the Cover d'Alene district is guarded
by one or more companies of troops
and the Federal authorities believe that
the arrest of all suspects will be made
without serious trouble as soon as
identification is possible.
One hundred and twenty-eight men
accused of participating in Saturday's
riot have been arrested and are under
guard of United States troops near the
railroad station here. General Merriam
has established a strict censorship over
the telegraph office here and nothing
is allowed to go out regarding the plans
for the arrest of the remaining sus
pects.
The taking of testimony in the Coro
ner's inquest over the bodies of Smith
and Cheyne, who were shot and killed
by the mob Saturday, was commenced
to-day by Coroner France behind closed
doors. Attorney General Hays of Idaho
arrived to-day and was present at the
inquest on behalf of the State. Im
portant witnesses on the stand to-day
were Sheriff James Young of Shoshone
County, JamessÃ. Sovereign, ex-master
workman of the Knights of Labor, and
Albert Hutton, a Northern Pacific en
gineer. The Attorney General refused
to disclose the nature of the testimony
until all the witnesses have been ex
amined. ' .'.
The troops arriving here to-day from
the West are sixty men from Company
B, Twenty-fourth United States Infan
try (colored), from Vancouver Barracks,
Washington, under command of Lieu
tenant Murphy, and Troop F. Fourth
Cavalry, from Boise, under Lieutenant
Walsh. Six companies of the Twenty
fourth Infantry arrived last night and
to-day from the East and will probably
be held at Burke. Wallace and Mullen.
REPUDIATED ITS CONTRACTS. |
WOODLAND, May 4.â A year ago sev
eral raisin growers In this vicinity made
a contract with a San Francisco house
for the delivery of their raisin crops at a
stipulated price. Before the season was
fairly open the price began to fall and
the firm repudiated its contracts, and as
a result the raisin growers sustained
heavy losses. A lawyer has been making
an examination of these contracts, and
declares he can collect damages. A ma
jority of the raisin growers have about
concluded to bring suit for damages or
for the fulfillment of the contract.
Big Shipment of Sheep.
WOODLAND, May 4.â One of the larg
est shipments of sheep from Woodland for
many years was made on Tuesday after
noon by Miller & Lux. The drove was
brought to this city from a range in
Capay Valley, and consisted of 3500 head.
A train of thirteen double-decked cars,
which is equal to twenty-eight ordinary
boxcars, .was required to move them. The
sheep were forwarded to the ranch of
, Miller & Lux at Madera. ,

FIERCE FIGHT FOR
SPOILS OF VICTORY
Burns Chiefly Concerned in. Get
ting Commissioned Senator.
Major McLaughlin Will Resign the Chair
manship of the Republican State
Committeeâ Gage Goes to
Sacramento.
ALL the politicians and place
seekers had something to talk
about yesterday when they read
The Call's exclusive account of
the secret conference at the Pal
ace Wednesday afternoon, in which
Governor Gage, Wendell Easton, D.
M. Burns and Major Frank McLaugh
lin discussed for three hours the sub
ject of official patronage and its distri
bution.
When the fact was made known that
the merits of various candidates had
been canvassed, and that some of the
(â¢fflce-seekers who had been accounted I
as foremost in the race ere found un- j
acceptable, diligent inquiry was made
to ascertain additional facts relating i
to the com.: ence.
Yesterday morning a cruel hoax was
perpetrated on many candidates for the
lav. of the Governor. A paragraph
was inserted in a daily paper to the
effect that Governor Gage would receive
applicants for office at his room, 714
Palace Hotel, from 10 to '1 o'clock
Thursday. Many applicants who car
ried the Republican banner last fall,
and who had grown weary of long wait
ing in the vain hop of seeing the Gov
ernor to say a word to him, went to
the room indicated and found that ii
was the apartment of Stephen M.
White. The hoax afforded cheap amuse
ment for the (.-nlookers, but the victims
were very indignant. Mr. White was
surprised to receive so many callers,
but perceiving the situation promptly
dirtcted the visitors to the rooms of the
Republican State Cenerah Committee.
It was said later in the day that the
announcement to applicants repre
sented Governor Gage's idea "i" a joke'
at the expense cf Steve White.
Politicians of high and low degree,
were in the throngs which loitered
about the court of the Palace Hotel yes
terday. It was expected that another
conference would take place, but noth
ing of the kind occurred. Governor
Gage found it difficult to get a minute
for reflection. The pressure to see him
was so keen that one man could hardly
get in a word before another bruKe In
to advocate his own or some other one's
cause.
D. .M. Burns had an extended inter
view with the Governor at a table
in the grillroom at the close of a
lunch in which the executive was
joined by Wendell ston and J. K.
Wilson.
The story goes that Burns is so deeply
concerned in his own campaign for the
Senator_.hip that he Is not vigorously
pushing the claim of any aspirants fc-r
a State .office. He has been advised by
men whose friendship he cannot ques
tion that he should demand the issue
of his comniissioi* to be United States
Senator for California. He was told
by a plain-spoken adviser to go to the
Governor and speak out in this style:
"Let us understand each other, Gov
ernor. If you intend to appoint me
United States Senator issue my com
mission now, so I can go to Matt Quay
of Pennsylvania and show him that we
are fighting for a common object and
should make the contest together."
Whether Burns used this language
or not is immaterial. It is known that
he pleaded his own cause with a deal
of earnestness. Burns does not like
to be twitted with the suggestion that
a "gold brick" has been passed to him
by the Governor. He wants a commis
sion and wants it right away.
Men high in the councils o*f the party,
who have had in some measure the con
fidence of the Governor during the past
few days, would not be surprised if
Gage issued the commission, in order
to ..able. Burns to get in with Quay
and make a light for admission to the
United States Senate.
The current of the conference day be
fore yesterday ran hard against the
friends of Major Frank McLaughlin.
He desires that two of his friends shall
be appointed to office. His heart is set
on having one of the two selected. It
is understood that Gage will appoint
one of the men so warmly indorsed, but
it is not the one on which the major's
heart is set. An explosion may be ex
pected when the major is tojd that the
appointment he 'so much desires can
not be made. The office in question is
not that of Registrar of Voters.
There is a sharp fight for the office
of Registrar. The applicants are
Colonel George Pippey, Assemblyman
Rickard and Jacob Steppacher. It Is
the talk that Gage intends to do some
thing for Steppacher, but cannot ap
point him Registrar.
There is a strong belief that the ad
jutant generalship has been settled, and
that the Governor will soon name as his
chief of staff Colonel J. C. Currier of
San Francisco. A member of the ex
ecutive committee of the Republican
State Central Committee, who is known
to be ln sympathy with Colonel Cur
rier's aspirations, received a strong in
timation from the Governor yesterday
that the colonel was slated.
In connection with the Paris Expo
sition Commission there is a story of
a broken slate. The beautiful slate on
which was penciled the name of Mark
L. McDonald of Santa Rosa has been
smashed. The original slate provided
that there should be a Republican from
Los Angeles' to represent Southern Cal
ifornia, a Democrat from the north to
represent Northern California, and. a
Republican from San Francisco to rep
resent the central region of the State.
Exposition experience or training is one
of the qualifications which the law re
quires that % each commissioner shall
possess. The Legislature appropriated
$120,000 for the show. Each commis
sioner is to receive $5000 and traveling
expenses. The original slate embraced
B. C. Truman, Republican, Los Ange
les; M. H. di Young, Republican, San
Francisco, and Mark 1.. McDonald,
Demo .rat, Santa Rosa. De Young de
clined the appointment and the report
was circulated the Governor offered
the job to W. H. Mills of the Southern
Pacific. It is an open question whether
the appointment was tendered to Mills,
but it seems to be settled that he de
clined it. - The Governor finding it no
easy, matter to get the right kind of a
Republican in San Francisco now re
solves to appoint a good Democrat to
represent. Central California. The name
of the Democrat is not divulged, but
he is a resident of San Francisco.
Taking a Democrat from this, city
means that a Republican commissioner
shall be* chosen to represent Northern
California and 'therefore Mr. McDonald
is excluded. There is still hope for the
Santa Rosa candidate, as the Governor
'is at liberty to change his mind. A re
port was circulated yesterday that the
Northern California Republican would
be M. M. Estee of Napa.
Walking Delegate Saunders, backed
by George Washington Baker, put In a
strong claim yesterday for Immediate
appointment to the office of Labor
Commissioner. I!" detached the Gov
ernor from Judge Carpenter and held
I him for ten minutes. The feat was j
performed in the presence of W. W. !
Foote, George A. Knight, ex-Secretary
of State Brown, Jesse D. Carr of Sa
linas, Jim Rea of Santa Clara, Thomas â 
Flint Jr. of San Juan, Major Hendy,
Wendell Easton, Paris Kilburn, Jack
Tyrrell, Mark L. McDonald, Judge Car
penter and several charter members of
I th.' Gold Brick Insurance Company.
U. S. Grant Jr. joined the crowd at
| large in the court of the Palace Hotel
j yesterday afternoon and calmly
checked his baggage for San Diego. He
was not unconscious of the fact that
the gathering of men had something to
do with the distribution of State pa
tronage. Mr. Grant entertains the
opinion that the United States Senate
will not seat a man appointed by a
Governor after the Legislature has
balloted and failed to fill the vacancy.
ll.' reasons that if such a precedent
were established a State Governor
could combine with a few members of
the Legislature and defeat an election
for the purpose of gaining an oppor
tunity to appoint. Mr. Grant went
south last evening.
Rabbi Voorsanger plunged into the
swirl of politics yesterday to help Dr.
Kohn, who is struggling to reach the
Board of Health.
The next sensation in political circles
may be the announcement of Major
Frank McLaughlin's resignation as
chairman of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee. Last evening The Call
received intelligence that he had de
cided to resign and retire altogether
from politics. An interview was sought
to verify the truth of the report, "but
Major McLaughlin declined to admit or j
deny the correctness of the statement. j
Inside information obtained from
other sources leads to the belief that
he will resign If the Governor fails to I
appoint to offlce a certain man whose j
claims have been vigorously pressed by
the chairman of the State committee.
The Call's Information Is also to the
effect that Governor Gage has decided
that the appointment which Major Mc-
Laughlin is so deeply interested in can
not be made.
It is known that Major McLaughlin
yesterday afternoon made to a leading j
citizen this statement: "I am sick and
tired of this political business and In
tend to resign and retire altogether
from politics."
The statement In the Bulletin last
evening is correct that Governor Gage
invited Colonel E. F. Preston to attend
the conference at the Palace Hotel re
â  lating to appointments. This confer
ence, was called to review recommenda
tions for public office, but before it con
i vened Governor Gage had already made
several important appointments. Fur
] thermore he had announced that his
| mind was fixed concerning other ap
. pointments, hence he had little to be
stow, beyond a sop to satisfy the clam
orous.
It may be interesting now to recall â 
the fact that Henry T. Gage, prior to
his nomination for Governor by the Re- j
publican State convention, solemnly I
promised that he would not make any i
appointments before he consulted cer
tain loaders in whose presence the
promise was made. He did appoint 1 '
men to office in violation of his agree
ment and now at this late day seeks
to mend his broken word.
Governor Gage left the city for Sac
ramento at 6 o'clock last evening. He
said just before his departure that he
would make some appointments shortly
after reaching the capital. The predic
tions for the Code Commission are Van
Fleet, Freeman and Denis.

Another nation has been drawn Into the
boarding-masters' war. The Italian ship
owners have joined issues with the Brit
ish and are now denouncing the law of
February 20.
The Italian ship Caterina Accame is
loaded and ready to sail for Europe. Cap
tain Bellando tried hard to get a crew
for the one month's advance allowed by
the new law. but the boarding-masters
laughed at him. In consequence a crew

that were in force last January, but then
the entire sum went down against the
j sailor as an "advance on account," but
now only $20 can be charged up against
him and the remainder comes out of the
' pocket of the shipowner.
The crew that went north on the steam-
i er Columbia for the British ship Howard
D. Troop will reach Astoria this morning.
As told exclusively In yesterday's Call,
there will be a strong tight to keep the
men from going aboard the ship.
The expenses of the Britisher are run
! ning up Into four figures and it will be a
very expensive experiment for Captain
Corning if his sailors now on the Colum
bia are taken away by the boarding-mas
ter. It has already cost $800 and over to
secure the men and the expenses of the
ship while she lies in the Columbia River
will not be less than $100 a day. The
Troop has now been tied up ten days
awaiting a crew, so th.it those two items
alone total up a large sum. Then there
is the insurance on the cargo, the loss
through delay and a dozen other things
! which will run the expense bill of Cap
tain Corning up to something like $3000. ,
At the present time there are tied up in
' the Columbia River the British ships
! Bothwell, Iverna, Sunford, British Prin
cess, WaJlacetown and Mistley Hall. The
British Princess is almost ready for sea
and Captain Scott has already written to
I San Francisco asking the rates for a
crew. He has been answered that the
rates are $20 advance, $20 "blood money"
and $."i shipping fee. Those are the rates
here and he must take his chances about
getting the men to the Columbia River. It
I looks as though Captain Scott will get his
men from the Portland boarding-masters.
â¢ The latter are Inclined to treat him leni
ently and if Captain Corning of the How
ard D. Troop fails to secure his men from
.thÂ«. steamer Scott will pay up and the
'â  shipowners will charge up the amount to
. profit and loss. The debit entry will run
Into $1000, as the Portland boarding-mas
ters will not accept a cent of "advance"
money, but insist upon the whole sum be
ing classed as a "bonus" or "blood
money." not a cent of which can be
charged up against the sailor.
The Portland hoarding-masters assert
' that they arc obeying the law, as they
i require no â¢'advance." They say there
are no sailors to speak of on the Colum
i bia River, and in order to give a ship a
crew they have to get the men from San
Francisco or Puget Sound. This means
I a considerable outlay for transportation
i and keep and the $20 advance would not
begin to pay the expense bill. _ >
The members of the Sailors' Union have
very little use for the boarding-masters,
whom they call "crimps," and less for the
shipowners who will not pay union
i wages. ; â  '..,.'.
Drunk With Her Baby.

STABBED IN

John Johnson Mur
derously Assaulted.
â â¢ â
HIS RECOVERY IS DOUBTFUL
â â¦ â
THE ASSAILANT A SLAVONIAN
OF BAD REPUTE.
â¦
Knockout Drops Were First Used, but
the Dose Was Miscalculated.
Robbery Is the Supposed
Motive.
John Johnson, a sailor, was stabbed by
a Slavonian, who refuses to give his
name, in the doorway of a saloon at
Jackson and Sansome streets at about 10
o'clock last night. The doctors have little
hope for his recovery.
The two men entered the saloon at
about 9 o'clock. Johnson accented the
Slavonian's Invitation to have a drink and
called for a glass of beer. While the two
men were drinking the bartender noticed
the Slavonian tampering with his com
panion's liquor, but did not pay much at
tention to him. After finishing the beer
the two started out to go to a theater.
As they were Hearing the door the sailor
suddenly put his hand to his head and
said that he could not go any farther, as
he was so dizzy he could not see.
He was helped into a chair and relaxed
Into a semi-stupor. In about half an hour
he roused up and started out with the
Slavonian. The door had hardly closed
upon them when Johnson uttered a pierc
ing shriek, followed by a fainter ejacula
tion: "Oh, I'm cutâ l'm cut bad!"
The cries attracted a crowd from inside
1 the saloon and Officers Greenwald and
. Kerrison, who were patrolling their beats
. in the vicinity,
Johnson lay on the doorstep weltering
\ in his blood, while the Slavonian, realiz
â¢ ing what he had done, started up the
street as fast as he could run. He was
pursued by the two policemen and a
crowd of citizens. lie ran directly into
his room on Montgomery near Broadway,
where he was located a few minutes later.
In one corner of the room was a basin of
I bloody water, which told its own tale of
1 how ho had attempted to conceal his guilt
by washing away the stains of his vic
tim's blood and then play innocent when
i the officers arrived. There was a great
blotch of blood on his coat sleeve near the
I wrist and another on the lapel of his coat.
I The knife with which the cutting was
done could not be found.
The would be assassin offered no resist
j ance when told he was under arrest, but
at the California-street police station he
j refused positively to give his name, and
sat sullenly In one corner of the cell.
' Johnson was put in the patrol wagon and
, hurried to the Harbor Receiving Hospital,
where it was- found that the murderous
i knife had entered his abdomen five times.
I The wounds were dressed, but the doctors
I have little hope of his recovery.
Later In the evening the Slavonian was
I sent by Sergeant Helms to the hospital,
and Johnson at once identified him as his
assailant.
Although the man refuses to divulge
his name, he is well known to the polite
as one of tit* worst characters that ever
infested the low saloons along the water
front or the deadfalls of the Barbary
Coast. He has been under arrest several
times for using knockout drops and other
offenses. He is a powerfully built man
with a blonde mustache and an evil
countenance. When Sergeant Helms or
dered two officers to remove him from the
cell that he might get a good look at him
the man fought like a demon, and would
have overpowered the men had not the
sergeant come to his assistance. In his
room on Montgomery street three bottles
were found which are supposed to con
tain knockout drops.
It is thought that his plan was to drug
Johnson In such a manner that he would
fall senseless on the street, and Mien re
lieve him of his valuables, but tne plans
miscarried. He then tried to disable him
in the doorway, but the murderous blow
produced neither death nor insensibility.
At an early hour this morning the knife
wiolder gave his name as Pomenico Ru
maz, and his nativity as Austrian.

Judge Groezinger Fails to See Ary
Difference Between Check
Machines and Card
Machines.
The crusade against nickel-in-the-slot
machines last December has not met with
the success which was anticipated. The
cases were originally assigned to Judge
Treadwell's court and. he convicted sev
eral of the defendants, but on the cases
being appealed the judgment was re
versed, as. the arrests had been made un
der the section of the Penal Code which
refers to lotteries, instead of section 330,
which refers to banking games. Then
arrests were made under section 330.
yesterday twelve of the defendants
pleaded quilting. in Acting Police Judge
Groezinger's court and agreed not to use
any of the machines in their saloons
again. Their names were Edward Lun
stedt, Richard Carr, William Spahr, Al
Whit.'. Alfred Dohlman, J. C. Myles, Wil
liam Bogen, Alfred Bradsay, William Pe
ters. A. Bergstrom. M. J. Ward and M.
J. Boyce. The machines they used were
those that passed out checks redeemable
at the tear by money or drink.*.
The Judge said he had no reason to
doubt that the defendants would keep
their promise and he thought the ends of
justice would be subserved by their keep
in",* the machines out of their saloons.
lie would therefore Impose a nominal
fine.
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter re
minded the Judge that under section 330
the lowest penalty was a fine of $100.
".Well," said the Judge, "1 will make
the fine In each case $100 with no alterna
tive, but if they should again be charged
with a similar offense the fine would be
$100 with the usual alternative. I see no
difference between these machines and
the machines used in cigar stores. The
one is as much a banking game as the
other, and why the police can see a dis
tinction is beyond my comprehension.
Judge Morrow decided in the Federal
court in a case regarding an Infringe
ment of a copyright on these cigar ma
chines that they were purely banking
games and had no right to get a pat
ent."
Fourteen other cases were continued till
May 17, as the defendants pleaded not
guilty and will ask for a trial by jury.
There are. including these, altogether
about thirty cases in the different courts
yet to be tried.
Chief Lees did not like the decision of
Acting Judge Groezinger in making "no
alternative." He said that the only way
to do was for the Board of Supervisors
to instruct the City and County Attorney
to institute civil suits against each of the
defendants for the recovery of the fine.
The matter was out of his hands. He
had no hesitation in saying that these
machines were rank robberies and filched
the hard earned money out of the pockets
of the workingman. Regarding machines
in cigar stores he had only to say that
the Board of Supervisors licensed them.
Trouble Over a Courtroom.
Judge Graham and Acting Judge (.roe- !
singer had a dispute yesterday morning
as to the temporary occupancy of Judge
Conlan's courtroom. Judge Groezlnger's
bailiff had his prisoners in the dock first,
and Judge Graham's bailiff had to make
a masterly retreat. Judge Graham de
manded possession of the courtroom and
Judge Conlan was called In to decide. He
decided in favor of Groezinger, as Groe
zinger had taken over the cases on his
calendar. Graham, who is presiding
Judge, has called a meeting for this
morning of the three Judges and is deter
mined to have the courtroom.

FORGES A BROTHER'S
NAME AND DECAMPS
Howard Emerson Is a Victim of
Race Track Gambling.
Well-Known Centerville Attorney Disap
pears and His Affairs Are Said to
Be in a Very Bad Muddle.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, May 4.
HOWARD EMERSON, a well-known
lawyer and politician of Center
ville. is missing, and racetrack
gambling has scored another vic
tim. Emerson disappeared last Tuesday
and now all kinds of charges against him,
including misappropriation of funds in
trusted to his care, forgery and embez
zlement, are in circulationâ the race
track is held responsible for it all, as the
man who is looked upon as an absconder,
even by the members of his own family,
is said to have been an Inveterate gam
bler, his favorite field of operations being
the Emeryville resort. Almost the last
act of Emerson before his disappearance
was to forge the name of his brother,
Dr. H. W. Emerson, health officer at Cen
terville, to a number of checks, which he
cashed. He also hypothecated securities
belonging to his sister, and it is strongly
suspected that he has managed to obtain
other sums by equally illegal methods.
He was the attorney for several large
estates at Centerville. among them be
ing the James Graham, C. J. Stevens and
Fair estates, and his affairs are said to
be so badly mixed that It will be Impossi
ble to determine the extent of his mis
deeds without a thorough examination of
his accounts by an expert.
Emerson came to Oakland last Tues
day, the day of his disappearance, and
requested J. B. Lanktree, a money
broker, to cash seven checks for $60 each,
signed by his brother, the physician. He
was given the money, and from that time
nothing has been seen of him. He has
dropped out of sight as completely as
though the earth had opened and swal
lowed him.
To-day Dr. Emerson, alarmed by his
brother's continued absence, came to
Oakland to make inquiries as to his
whereabouts. He failed to locate the
LAKEVIEW ROAD.
Mrs. Dr. Merritt's Demand Bars the
Way to the Extension of
the Line.
The Sunnyslde Improvement Club held
an Important meeting last night. The at
titude of Dr. Emma Sutro Merritt on
the proposed Lakeview railroad was dis
cussed at length, and near the close of j
the meeting it was decided to send a del- j
egation to A. B. Spreckels, the president
of the San Francisco and San Mateo
Electric Railroad, with a view to bring
ing about an amicable settlement.
During the â¢ discussion it was shown
that the owners of -the street railway
were anxious to extend. the line on Sun- i
nyslde .avenue to the -'lngleside coursing
grounds and on Plymouth avenue, via the
Lakeview district, to the ocean road.
â¢.The only obstacle to the purposed, im- j
provement comes from Mrs. Merritt. who I
wants the company to pay the cost of
grading, sewering, macadamizing and ;
sidewalking along the entire right of way.
Her demand was refused by the railroad
company, which stated Its willingness to
pave its portion of the roadway. In mak- I
ing its declination the railroad officials I
stated that they were unwilling to put
Mrs. Merritt's entire property In condition
for the privilege of securing a right of
way through her land. As such an exten
sion would be of material benefit to the
residents of the Sunnyside district an ef- !
fort will be made to bring about a com- ,
promise.
The double track now under construe- I
tion from Thirtieth street to the ceme
teries by the San Francisco and San Ma
teo Railroad Company has been looked j
1 upon as a forerunner of prosperity by the ;
' people living along the line of road, as it
will result in their securing speedier
' transit and easier access to the downtown
; portions of the city.
THE NEW CURATOR.
Reception at the Mark Hopkins In-
stitute of Art This Evening.
This evening at the Mark Hopkins In
stitute of Art there will be a reception
to Captain Robert Howe Fletcher, the
new curator of the Art Association. All
of the members of the association and
the teachers and students of the school
have been invited.
As an army officer, a writer of stories
and a contributor of high jinks papers
Captain Fletcher is a success. What his
record will be as curator, and especially
a curator at his own reception, remain-*
to be determined. Observation will be
taken of his bearing this evening. If he
shows the least sign of agitation Joseph
D. Grant and Horace Piatt will be handy
to reinforce him. As a platform talker
Captain Fletcher has merit. On ordinary
occasions he scorns to produce manu
script to refresh his memory or establish
any other signal of mental distress. It is
expected that eloquent music and charm
ing company will welcome him to his new
station of duty.

We desire to formally express to the

it is wholly unnecessary to state that this

As to the value of the goods which

missing man. but it would not -be strictly
true to say he found no trace of. him. Al
most the first Information gained by the
Centerville health officer was that his
brother had forged his signature to a
warrant for his (the doctor's) month's
salary, amounting to $50. and secured the
cash. Next he was shown the checks
bearing his signature, which had been
cashed by Lanktree, and he at once
pronounced the signatures to be rank
forgeries. :
Dr. Emerson also learned in the course
I of the day that his brother had hypothe
cated a note for $250 executed by County
I Clerk Jordan in favor of the missing at
: torney's sister, for $25. The revelations in
; connection with the disappearance of his
! brother which the doctor's visit to the
city produced filled him with consterna
: tion. The illegal doings of Emerson have
only just begun to rome to light, and In
view of the fact that he was known to
Ik hard up and that ho has a passion for
gambling on horse races, it is feared that
! his peculations will amount to a largo
sum when the whole truth is known.
"My brother left his home in Center
: ville last Tuesday morning.'' said Dr.
Emerson to a Call reporter this after
j noon, "and I have not seen him since.
I His affairs, however, are much jumbled
j up. He collected one month's salary
I coming to me from the county, amount
l ing to $50. He simply made out a war-
I rant for the amount, signed my name to
it and cashed it at a broker's. There are
! also some other matters of which I do
! not care to make mention at this time.'"
Shortly before his disappearance the at
; torney secured the signature of his broth
i er to a document, the nature of which
â  the doctor does not recollect. The latter
I is considerably exercised over the matter
i In view of to-day's developments, as* he
i fears he may have been induced to sign
! an Important instrument.
The missing man is about 35 years old
; and as well thought of in the community
j where he resided, being regarded as a
j hail fellow well met. IT" always enjoyed
i the fullest confidence of those who knew
j him. and it Is believed that his downfall
I dates from the time a few months ago
I when he began frequenting the racetrack
i at Emeryville.
MECHANICS AND CONTRACTORS.
Harmonious Condition of Affairs Ex-
isting Between the Two Bodies.
There was a spirit of go, feeling mani
fested at the meeting of the delegates to
the Builders' and Trades Council last
night. It was announced that the
contractors had cheerfully agreed to the
recent rules adopted by the Carpenters'
Union. To show the appreciation of the
action the Builders' Trades Union passed
a vote of thanks to the contractors.
Grand Organizer R. L. Malsbarv re
ported that Painters' Union No. 73 was or
ganized and in. good shape to make its
influence felt ... among the other -labor
unions. This union will be composed of
all painters and decorators In this city
and none but first class workmen will be
admitted. A membership in the union will
be a certificate to those employing paint
ers and decorators that they are getting
flrst classsmen to do their work. Dele
gates James Massey. E. H. Windsor and
Thomas. Linton were admitted as mem
bers of the Builders' and Trades Council.
A report on the condition of labor in
San Francisco was received from Organ
izer Malsbary. In which Be stated that
everything looked bright and cheerful for
the wage-earners, since the utmost har
mony existed between the employers and
the employes.
The council passed a resolution com
mending the daily press and the police for
the stand taken against the gambling sa
loons along the line of Market street.
Attorney C. G. Nagle appeared before
the council on behalf of the proprietor of
the Battle of Manila Panorama, with
which the council has had some misunder
standing over union carpenters during the
construction of the building.
A SMUGGLER CAUGHT.
Customs Inspector Harrigan caught a
smuggler very cleverly yesterday morn
ing at 4 o'clock, and the smuggler, whose
name is William Clay, is at present re
posing in the County Jail. At the hour
named Harrigan saw Clay stealing along
the wharf to a pile of lumber, behind
which he disappeared. Harrigan followed
him and saw him receive a small tele
scope basket which some unknown per
son had let down from one of the dead
lights of the forecastle of the steamer
Curacao. Harrigan grabbed Clay and the
basket and found the plunder to be 475
Mexican cigars, valued at from 10 to 12
cents each.
Upon the fact of the seizure being re
ported to Deputy Surveyor St. John that
official ordered all hands to make a
thorough search of the steamer, which
was done, and 525 more smuggled cigars
were found by Inspector Lundqulst in
the forepeak. concealed among a pile of
life preservers.
Raided a Lottery i tace.
Sergeant Shea and posse yesterday raid
ed the rooms on Kearny street and seized

SEAL HERD SCATTERED.
| But Little Left of the Point Reyes
Rookeries.
It is very evident that the sea lion herd
of Point Reyes is pretty well broken up
and scattered by the hunters who have
been for the past few days gunning for
the big marine beasts. The onslaught
proper was made on Monday, the hunters
emptying their magazine rifles Into the
rookeries where the herd was taking a
sun bath. After that Deputy Wilson con
tinued the killing, picking off the seals
one by one as they went by in the en
deavor to get back to the ledges on which
they were wont to bask. Yesterday a let
ter was received from Mr. Wilson, who
wrote from Point Reyes under the date
of May 2, as follows:
The lions that are here now are most all of
the big gray variety and cannot be -worked
from my ..id points. They are more 'â¢: th..
deep-water kind, bo to do anything with them
I had to get into the rookery, which was no
easy task. I out some steps into the rock to
day, so I think I can get into their camp to
morrow on a rope. I will shoot on the out
posts until they leave camp, then take mv po
sition and wait their return. I do not think
there will be enough here to hold me but a
few days. For some reason there has not been
many here since my last visit.
One Who has not been on the ground
has no idea of the difficulty and dangers
attending the project of Mr. Wilson to
get down to the rookeries proper. The
"roosting" places of the seals are located
at the foot of cliffs that rise from the
water to a height of 700 feet. The favorite
resorts are in a circular cove" protected
on the north, east and south by perpen
dicular bluffs, down which it is impossi
ble to descend unless the adventurer does
as Mr. Wilson has .doneâ cut steps. into
the solid rocks. Even then it is likely
that it will lie necessary to use a rope to
get to the water near the rookeries. By
the time Mr. Wilson empties a few hun
dred more cartridges into the stragglers
the herd will be so badly broken and de
moralized that it will he a long time be
fore they collect there again in any num
bers.

AMERICAN INTERESTS
Old Glory Will Be Seer) at the Ports

stantly After This.
2* NEW YORK, May 4.â Washington special to the Herald says: g
Â£> Measures have been initiated by the Navy Department which content- g
!^ plate providing constant protection for American interests in Central Si
88 America. As the result of a consultation between Acting Secretary 0
X Allen and Rear Admiral Crowninshield, instructions have been given 88
tv to Rear Admiral ,Hichborn, chief constructor, to fit out the converted &
Â£> yacht Viking for duty in. Central American waters as expeditiously as J*
g possible. The Viking's small draught will permit her to enter the shal- Â«
0 low waters on the eastern coast of Central America, so that the Amer- &
25 lean flag will be flying constantly at Honduran and Nicaraguan ports. #
Â£, The determination to send the Viking to Central America is the re- 25.
a suit of communications received at the State Department from Ameri- Â§
â¢S cans in Honduras and Nicaragua which have hitherto been referred to 8.

A . i-
PURE FOOD LAW
IS BADLY NEEDED
To Protect Buyers in
America.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. May i.â The Senatorial Pure
Food investigating Committee held its
second session here to-day. Giles Lewis,
a druggist of this city, testified that while
i other countries prevented the selling of
; adulterated goods "within their own bor
ders no provisions were made against ex
porting them to foreign countries. He de
clared that the United States received
articles made In Germany and France that
; could not be sold in the country "where
i they were made because of the preserva
: lives used. Mr. Lewis said adulteration
I could be divided into two classes, one of
j which was the adding of coloring matter
' for the sake of appearance and the other
was to give fictitious values to articles of
I food. His advice to the committee was
j that a national pure food law be installed
and a permanent commission be installed
in office, the duty of which would be to
prevent the marketing of any article of
food or drink, domestic or imported,' that
was misrepresented. The limit of adul
teration, he declared, should be governed
by the commission, and the committee
should analyze all articles and certify to
their purity by a Government stamp.
Dr. Wiley next took the stand anu gave
information to the committee regarding
the articles sold in this country which
were adulterated. Among practices that
are fraudulent, yet not injurious to the
health, he mentioned the sale of fish* of
cheap variety and grade for more ex
pensive kinds, especially fish packed in
oil. It also is a common custom. Dr.
Wiley said, for dealers to stamp pack
ages with foreign stamps and deceive the
public into believing it was buying im
ported goods. Horse flesh, according to
the expert, was commonly used for food
purposes in European countries and la
beled as beef, but he did not know of its
| being used to any great extent in this
' country. The sales of turtles in restau
| rants for terrapin was also a common
means of defrauding the public.
Famous wines and other drinks of for
eign countries are on sale on American
markets that never saw the color of the
ocean.
Adulterated food and drink which are
injurious to the public health, the witness
said, could be classed in two groupsâcol
oring and preserving. The coloring mat
ter was used principally because it was
pleasing to the eye and made the food
palatable.
The matter which is used principally
in restoring the color of green peas, the
witness declared, sometimes was salt of
zinc and sometimes salt of copper, either
of which is poisonous, and the use of
which should not be permitted. "Probably
the chemical most used as a preservative,
according to Dr. Wiley, Is salycilic acid,
which is made to a great extent from car
bolic acid. It should not be permitted, he
said, because It was very injurious, espe
cially to those who have weak stomachs.
He ended his testimony by Baying that no
food offered for sale which contained pre
servatives was tit to eat.
THE MURDOCK CASE
NEARING THE END
Witness Powers Loses Some of His
Positiveness Under Severe
Cross-Examination.
WILLOWS, May 4.â the opening of
court this morning, in the Murdock suit.
Jack Powers was recalled for further
cross-examination. He seemed to lose
some of his positiveness that was prom
inent yesterday. Adam and Ira Comp
ton testified to a trip Ira Compton and
William Murdock made to Modoc Coun
ty in 1887. This testimony was directed
to showing that William Murdock was
not at the State Fair in 1887. Not much
success was made, however, in that line.
The defense then Introduced a lot of cop
ies of the records of Tehama County,
which they claimed went to contradict
Witness Ashurst and G. W. Murdock.
The whole financial condition of Tehama
was gone into and put in evidence, but
showed little more than that Tehama
County was in a fair condition in 1877-78.
G. G. Murdock and his sister. * Lizzie
Smith, swore to a conversation they had
with the plaintiff in 1881 and 1887, and sev
eral, letters of a social nature were* read
in evidence to show that the relation of
the Lake County Murdochs were friendly
with' the plaintiff and her husband in
1881-87. Â:.'
Mary Compton, sister of William Mur
dock, wished to testify as to what Mur-i
dock said during his last illness concern
ing the note in suit, but was shut out by
the court. Several depositions were read,
the main one being that of plaintiff,
taken last year.
Just before adjournment the defense
offered a lot of depositions looking to the
impeachment of Witness Ashurst, but
plaintiff's attorneys . objected and this
matter will be argued to-morrow morn
ing. The end seems near. â¢:â¢"

LAKE COMMERCE
Buffalo Strikers Control
Situation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BUFFALO, May 4.â The grain shov
elers and the freight-handlers have
pronounced their ultimatum to the
Lake Carriers'. Association. At a mass
meeting this .afternoon, it was an
nounced amid great applause that un
less the Lake Carriers' Association ac
ceded to the demands of the men by
to-morrow noon, the entire commerce
of the lakes from Buffalo to Duluth
would be tied up.
The hall was filled and a crowd stood
about on the outside. They were or
derly, but determined. The meeting
was addressed by John M. Hennessy.
â President P.. J. McMahon, of the new
shovelers' union;. M. J. Foley, repre
senting the men employed in the ele
vators, and others.
Mr. McMahon announced that the
time had come when the whole plan !
of the movement could be made
known.
"We have everything in our power."
he said. "Unless the Lake Carriers'
Association comes to our terms by to
morrow at noon, the commerce of Buf
falo and along the lakes will be tied up.
We have been working on this matter
for weeks and know what we are do
ing. If we want financial help we can
get all we need." *". :- j
He thanked the men- for the good"
judgment they had shown in keeping
quiet and orderly, and cautioned them
about getting into any trouble. In
front of the hall there were about 700
Poles, members of the new Freight
Handlers' Union, and the speeches
were translated into Polish for them.
M. J. Foley announced, amid loud
cheers, that to-morrow at noon, every
man now working in an elevator would
quit.
"All we want is" what is fair." he said,
"but we will stand by you men to the
end. The coal handlers who have been
serving the Lake Carriers' vessels have
already quit work, the engineers will
go out to-morrow and the contractors
will do no more work on the docks in
Buffalo."
FURTHER EVIDENCE
AGAINST DESIRELLO
Prosecution of the Slayer of James
Johnston at Colma Js Almost
Completed.
REDWOOD CITY, May 4.-The third
day of the trial of Fred Desirello for the
murder of James Johnston ended this
afternoon without any startling develop
ments. Since yesterday afternoon the
time has been devoted to the examination
and cross-examination of witnesses for
the prosecution. This morning the pro
ceedings began with the cross-examina
tion .of John Vaccari. The defense laid
great stress, upon the fact that at the
Coroner's inquest witness testified that
the defendant said he shot to kill, while
at the preliminary examination he ad
mitted on cross-examination that the
words used were shot to kill the horses
This coincides with the theory of the de
fense that Desirello shot at the horses to
bring them to a halt, as he supposed they
were running away. Henry Jensen, the
third boy upon the wagon at the time of
the shooting, gave testimony similar to
that of Vaccari. He corroborated Vac
cari in the statement made by defendant
"Shut your mouth, or I'll put a bullet
through you," when Vaccari asked him
why he shot at them. The cross-examina
tion of the witnesses has been conducted
by Judge E. F. Fitzpatrick and has been
very exhaustive' in an effort to shake the
testimony. Before court adjourned three
other witnesses for the prosecution gave
evidence, viz.â lda Ravn, Lillie Ravn and
John Rockford. The prosecution will
probably close some time to-morrow, and
possibly the defense will commence the
Introduction of evidence. It is likely, how
ever, that the case wil not go to the jury
before Saturday afternoon. . .
QUARTZ DISCOVERED IN
LOS ANGELES COUNTY
Valuable Ledge Tapped Near the
Surface That Assays $10 a Ton
in Gold.
FALLBROOK STATION, Cat,', May .4â
Arthur Coventry, a young Englishman,
has been prospecting his ranch near
Fallbrook. This is an old settled country
and no one dreamed that anything of a
mineral nature" would ever be developed
here, but as Coventry went on excavating
and prospecting people began to take
more interest. Yesterday he came to a
ledge in a tunnel thirty feet below the
surface. He finds the ledge ten feet wide
of a hard quartz, containing sul
phites, easily worked by the cyanide
process, and shows an assay of $10
per ton in gold and considerable silver
Upon the discovery other farmers
.began to prospect and found a large part
of the country composed of the same kind
of rock, which shows gold in paying
quantities from the surface. While the
assays are low, the quantity of the ore
th'_ ease with which it can be reduced
and the location of the district will serve
to increase its value. The prospects are
within a mile of the railroad station and
near a good stream of water, the Santa
Margatita River.

SPAIN TO DEMAND
CHINESE TERRITORY
Collecting Evidence to
That End.
_ Â»
Special Dispatch to The Call.
. HONGKONG, May 4.â Spain is col
lecting evidence here with a view to
claiming a cession of land in China as
indemnity from the Chinese Govern
ment for permitting the steamer Abbey
to leave Canton last August with arms
for the Filipinos.
The little steamer Abbey, or Abby,
was seized by the armed dispatch boat
of Admiral Dewey's squadron on Sep
tember 23 last. She was of American
register, though formerly known as the
Pasig. It was reported to Admiral
Dewey that she was carrying arms and
supplies of war to the Filipinos and he
sent the McCuiloch to intercept her.
When the American cutter finally
found the Abbey in Batangas Bay, on
the southern" coast of Luzon, the fllli
buster had landed her cargo of arms
and ammunition and the insurgents re
fused to give them up. Thereupon the
Abbey was seized and taken by the
McCuiloch to Manila, in accordance
with Admiral Dewey's desire to main
tain the status quo in the Philippines
pending the conclusion of the work of
the Peace Commission in Paris.
YOUNGEST CRIMINAL
IS AGAIN AT LARGE
Ricardo Machado, Suspected of Mur-
der and Convicted of Burglary,
Escapes From Whittier.
LOS ANGELES, May 4.â Ricardo Ma
chado, who is probably ; the youngest
criminal that was ever placed behind the
bars of any jail in California, is again at
large. . '
Ricardo is a little Mexican who hails
from San Pedro, and during his residence
on earth of nine years has been tried on a
charge of murder and was a few weeks
ago convicted in the Superior Court of
burglary. Several months ago his play
mate, Willie Schmidt, was shot, and died
a few days late. As ne and Ricardo had
gone out together on that fatal afternoon
Ricardo was accused of the crime and
lav in jail for several weeks. He told a
plausible story while on the witness
stand, declaring that the gun simply went
off and that was all he could tell about
the affair. Between sobs he clutched his
overalls, that came to his knees, and with
his unkempt hair he presented a most
woebegone picture. When the jury re
turned a verdict of not guilty his parents
took him home, but he soon forgot his
troubles and was caught in the act of rob
bing a candy store. For this crime he
was speedily found guilty and later sent
to the Whlttler Reform School under sen
tence to remain until he became of age.
To-day the big whistle at the school
sounded the warning that Ricardo had
levanted, and the ranchers and officers
are scouring the country for the runa
way. \: :V- : 1"

PflY GAS CHARGES, BUT PROTEST
WHILE the question of the rate the gas com
pany can legally charge consumers is in doubt,
the company is faking full advantage of the
situation and is sending out bills at the old rate of
$1 75 per thousand feet and is making every effort to
collect them! It is therefore important the ratepayers
should take notice of their rights under the circum
stances and act accordingly.
For the purpose of saving his legal rights the con
sumer should, when the bill is presented, decline to
pay at the rate of Si 75 and make the collector a
tender of payment at the rate fixed by the Super
visors of Si 10 per thousand. The collector will
doubtless refuse to accept payment at thai rate, and
then notice will be served by the company that unless
the bill is paid as rendered the meter will be taken
from the consumer's premises and the gas shut off.
Under that threat the consumer should go to the
office of the gas company, pay the amount extorted,
but at the same time make a formal protest against the
payment of a rate greater titan Si 10. The result of
such a course will be that when the courts have pas-cd
upon the question, and have upheld the rate fixed by
the Supervisors, the consumer will have a right to re
cover from the company all that has been paid by him
in excess of the amount of legal charges.
If the protest he not made no part of the sum ex
torted by the company can be recovered, as the pay
ment in such case will be held in law to have been
voluntary. If. however, the bill be paid under protest,
and only because it is extorted by a threat to remove
the meter and shut off the gas. the payment is involun
tary and the excess extorted by the company must
be refunded. The right course to be pursued, there
fore, is to pay, but protest. The gas company can
be compelled to respect the law. if the public is firm
in upholding its rights.
AN EASTERN VIEW OF IT.
COMMENTING upon the question of the right
of a Governor to appoint a United States Sen
ator when a Legislature fails to elect, the Bos
ton Herald points out that the announced intention of
the executive of California to appoint Burns, taken in
connection with the appointment of Quay, confirms
the wisdom of the framers of the constitution in de
nying such powers to the Governors of States. The
Herald says:
"These cases in Pennsylvania and in California are
strictly on a par in one important respect. The Sen
ators elected by the respective Governors are both
of them men whom the people, acting through their
Legislatures, have refused to elect. The most
strenuous man in asserting the Governor's power will
hardly claim that the constitution intended that he
should use it to veto an expressed decision of the peo
ple, yet this is what will be done if these two men
from Pennsylvania and California are admitted to
seats in the Senate. The reason and the equity of
the case, as well as the law, as again and again in
terpreted, forbid Such claimants to seats from being
acce; *
The soundness 01 that statement is not to be de
nied. The- Herald occupies the position of an impar
tial student of the situation. From the distance of
Boston it has no affiliations with factions or State
politics either in California or in Pennsylvania. It
surveys the .Senatorial contests from. the standpoint
of national politics only, and its judgment, therefore,
cannot be attributed to any bias or prejudice against
either Burns or Quay.
The point made by the Herald does not of course
affect the legal argument, for that turns upon the
power of a Governor to appoint without reference to
the character of the man appointed. It does affect
the issue, however, as a matter of fact, since it shows
the importance of upholding a strict construction of
the constitution in this respect.
It has been said often. of the framers of the con
stitution, "They builded wiser than they knew," and
the provision of the government on this point may
be taken as one of the evidences of it. â  Certainly
in the light of present experience, if we had the con
struction of*, the constitution to go over again, the
danger of permitting Governors to appoint Senators
would be guarded against as carefully as it was by
the fathers, for we # have seen what, the fathers but
guessed at, that, were such powers conferred, Gov
ernors of States would intrigue to prevent the elec
tion of truly representative men to the Senate by
Legislatures in order to obtain for themselves the
opportunity of appointing some unworthy favorite of
their own. .

M. M. ESTEE'S BLUNDER.
ALL patriotic citizens in the American republic
/ \ united with the deepest enthusiasm in their
â¢â  * recognition of the honor due to -Admiral
Dewey, in his personal and in his representative
character. But Mr. Estee seized the opportunity of
his selection as one of the speakers on "Dewey day"
to deliver an unjust, virulent and t inexcusable tirade
against millions of Americans who oppose the policy
of foreign annexation or conquest. His address was
as palpable a violation of the proprieties of the occa
sion as the philippic of Senator Stewart at Oakland
in 1869 in favor of the Chinese, which desecrated our
national anniversary.
Mr. Estee is the Handy Andy of the Pacific Coast.
He can be safely relied upon to commit any possible
blunder upon any public occasion. During the last '
session of the Legislature he blatantly advocated the
candidacy of Dan Burns, and thus involuntarily
helped the public by contributing to his defeat. He
has now set up a non-existing administration policy,
and by his unsolicited contribution to the numerous
misrepresentations of the attitude of the Government
has furnished nutritious arguments against his own
opinions.
It would be tedious to follow Mr. Estee through
his labyrinthine fulmination. But a few of his sen
tences may be profitably segregated and their ab
surdity exposed. Evidently misled by the Examiner's
perversions of Thomas Jefferson, instead of deriving
his information from original sources, he directly re
verses that great statesman's expressed opinions and
presents him as an advocate of expansion in foreign
countries. He then oracularly states that ''the nation
will grow fastest which offers to the world the best
government and the greatest amount of good unoc
cupied land." This correct proposition, the most ob
vious argument for adherence to our constitutional
system, and for the development of the American re
public on this continent, is one of Mr. Estee's rea
sons for insisting upon Asiatic expansion! What rot!
It is beyond controversy that unless revolutionized by
the imperialists we have' the "best government" in
existence, and that there is abundance of "good un
occupied land" in California, in Texas, in Arizona
and in the greater part of the Union. We have land
and resources that would easily support five hundred
millions of Americans, living in harmony and it.
prosperity under their constitutional Government.
"As the Philippine archipelago is far more densely
populated than the United States, even if the climate
were not prohibitory to our farmers and our horti
culturists, there is no room for them in that unin
viting and distant group of Asiatic remnants.
Mr. Estee also follows the monotone of expansion in
attempting to analogize our unsuccessful management
cf a few scattered Indian tribes in this vast continent
to the task of subduing and governing ten millions of
Filipinos. If our own concerns are insufficient to
satisfy our energy and our cupidity, and there is a
demand that this Government should become a politi
cal missionary, extending freedom by the use of ar
tillery, it would be preferable to take up the cause of
the Armenians or the Finns and enforce our civiliza- i
tion upon the Turks and the Russians.
In another part of his address he wantonly abused ;
every American citizen who. in opposition to the
policy of Asiatic expansion, has exercised his inalien- j
able rights, guaranteed by the Declaration of Inde- j
pendence and by the constitution. He paraphrased â 
the observation of General Merritt that we have "out
grown the constitution" into the weaker expression
that we have "grown beyond our youthful restraints,", j
and characterized millions of Americans, who are
simply loyal to their institutions, as "the enemies of
our country." He also falsified the record by saying:
"We would have had no war with- the Filipinos if
dissatisfied Americans had not sought to make the
Filipinos believe that we were bent on their oppres
sion." This is a nice assertion to make and a nice
doctrine to* be proclaimed by an aspiring politician
who has frequently and unsuccessfully solicited the j
suffrages of his fellow citizens. In 1882 and again in
1806 Mr. Estee should have announced his opinion
that dissatisfaction among Americans and the free
discussion of questions affecting their constitution
and their national policy should be suppressed be
cause they tended to encourage semi-barbarism six
thousand miles away to resist invasion on their own
soil. He was twice and overwhelmingly beaten as it
was. If he had revealed his conversion to despotism
his first defeat would have been his last.
Finally Mr. Estee uses the mercenary argument as
a sort of climax to his partisan harangue on a day
sacred to American nationality: "We have bought
these islands and paid for them when we could have
got them by conquest." We purchased the abstract
pretensions of Spain to the Philippines and found
that we had secured no element of title, not even
naked possession. We are now engaged in the ap
plication of imperial 'precedents in the distinct line of
conquest. This may have been forced upon us by
the treaty' of Paris. But, if we had been contented
with the crushing victories over Spain, had returned
to our ordinary business of enlarging and improving
citizenship, had maintained the Monroe doctrine, had
adhered rigidly to our own principles and had con
secrated ourselves afresh to the fulfillment of our
legitimate mission, the Filipinos would not have been
puzzled by their relegation, in their own home, to the
ranks of "rebels" and "insurgents," and there would
have been no effort to ingraft imperial shoots on the
American vine, rooted in our revolutionary epoch. and
yielding delicious fruits to humanity.
Mr. Estee- is welcome to his witches' caldron of
contradictory sentiments. The Call prefers its
Americanism and the peaceful expansion of consti
tutional liberty.
BACKING THE PEACE CONFERENCE.
IF the coming peace, conference fail to accomplish
anything of good for the world it will not be for
lack of support among the people in any part of
the civilized world. Peace associations of all kinds
have been busily engaged in a campaign of education
on the subject ever since the Czar's invitation to the
powers was first made public, and arrangements have
been prepared lor making an international demon
stration of peace sentiment during the sessions of
the conference. . â¢
As was to have been expected, the lead in the in
ternational demonstration has been taken by the
ladies. Mrs. May Wright Sewall, the American-mem
ber of "The International Peace and Arbitration
Commission,"" has sent' out circulars announcing that
simultaneous meetings of women will be held May
15 in the more important towns all over the civilized
world. It is the programme that at the meetings the
women will proclaim their universal and unanimous
idea of peace and the promotion of the principle of
justice (instead of force) in the international relations
of peoples. Besides, they will interchange addresses
of sympathy with all the other women gathered for
the same cause and at the same hour in other coun
tries.
The support given to the conference, however, will
not be confined to that extended by the ladies of the
international demonstration and by professional peace
societies. There exists in the commercial and finah
;*ia_ world and 4n the higher circles of statecraft --a
THE SA.N FRANCISCO CALL. FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1899.
strong desire to see something of real value to the
cause of peace achieved by the movement now. under
way. London, being the center of the commerce and
finance of the time, is naturally the point at which
peace propositions are most cordially received, and
accordingly public- sentiment there is more sanguine
cf good results from the conference than that of per
haps any other large city.
The earnestness with which the British people have
taken up the cause of peace is shown by the recent
statement of the Bishop of London: "No subject has
been received with such complete enthusiasm and
unanimity as this subject of the promotion of peace;
there is no subject on which the English people' have
been approached for a long time in which they have
â¢shown such deep interest. And this is the more re
markable, for the English public are not given to the
expression of ideas in the abstract."
Mr. Balfour, leader of the House of Commons,
has made himself conspicuous also among the san
guine promoters of the cause. In a speech a short
time ago he declared his conviction that if war were
not to; be extinguished it would be at least greatly
diminished. He then went on to say: "Since the
conclusion of the great revolutionary wars this coun
try has only once been at war with a civilized power.
That is to say, in a period of more than eighty years
our peace with the civilized nations of the earth has
only been disturbed for a single period of about three
years. Compare that with what went on in the last
century. A man of 40 at the present time has never
seen war in this country."
There is no- gainsaying the strength of public sen
timent in favor .peace. All the same, the suppres
sion of Finland has been accomplished, the nations
go on increasing their armaments, and so small a
matter as a witty speech on the part of a witty cap
tain of the navy so arouses the war passions of a great
people like the Germans that they are ready to tax
themselves to build up a greater navy just to relieve
their feelings.
GOVERNMENT IN BUSINESS.
IN Los Angeles is a sort of Aaron's rod club,
called "The New Democracy," which is organized
for the purpose of swallowing all the other fac
tions, fragments, 1 crowns, scepters, creeds, platform.-,
muniments of power and evidences of authority in the
party.
In conformity to its high title, it is new, if not
fresh.
There have been new movements in the party be
fore, but they were simply in the form of changes in
its drill, tactics, manual of arms and field formation.
Such was Vallandigham's "Dayton platform," in
which, after the war, he amnestied and forgave the
Republican party and . advised taking up issues of
revenue and matters that did not relate to the Civil
War. its cause, continuance and result. But the Los
Angeles newness is newer than anything that has
heretofore been proposed. The club had announced
itself for all the new ideas in finance. It must be
confessed that these, ideas are very old, have been
often tried and abandoned as unscientific and un
tenable. But the Los Angeles club has just heard of
them, and therefore they are new to it. It has been
known ever since the troglodytes rubbed sticks to
gether and made a fire that it would burn any finger
that is stuck into it, but this knowledge is new to
every child that is born and finds it out by trial.
The club, however, does not stop at its financial
discoveries. It is not content with its childlike faith
that the stamp of the Government can turn fifty'cents'
worth of property into a dollar's worth. It craves for
more new things. Mayor Phelan has these on tap in
the form of public ownership of public utilities. On
Wednesday night he appeared before the club and
exhibited his list, whereupon the club, without leaving
its several seats, amended its constitution so as to call
for Government ownership of telegraphs, telephones,
transportation, wharfage facilities and postal savings
banks, and municipal ownership of water, lighting and
street railroad plants.
One is surprised that the club stopped with this
sumptuous programme. If there is anything neces
sary to human existence it is food, fuel and shelter.
Why chase monopoly out of the freight business, run
it off the wharf and drive* away from the well and
the gas house and leave it to monopolize tenements,
clothing and food supply?
Already the pernicious principle "of the trust has
seized the prune and raisin product of this State, and
henceforth our mince pie is of the humble variety,
eaten in tribute to a trust, and our stewed prunes are
fed to us out of the hand of the monopoly. The wool
and cotton trusts may soon be on our backs,
arjd against whom have reformers said harder things
than the landlord, who criminally erects houses and
wickedly rents them to the poor?
A man may live long and never ride on a street
car, and may nightly retire by the flickering candle
or the moonbeam's misty light. But he must have
some "duds" and a house to live in. One is aston
ished that the progressive Mayor paused in the mid
career of his state communist fight. He should in
clude the real utilities, without which life is impos
sible. Give us state tenement houses, municipal bread
and butter and beefsteak, Government potatoes and
gravy. Let the state -no longer confine its tailor busi
ness to the striped misfits that cover those who serve
it involuntarily and without consideration, but let it
set up as snip to all mankind and womankind, too.
When a lady wants a tailor-made suit' let her file her
plan and specifications with the Secretary* of State
and receive her vestments at the hand's of a Govern
ment messenger boy. who travels over a state rail
road and gets his pay out of the treasury.
The noble Roman-; did as well. The state bought
triticum and triturated it in a state mill and baked
loaves in a state oven, and the grangers all went to
town to feed on state bread, and had nothing to do
but talk politics and mash the heads of each other.
The new Democracy is at Los Angeles far on the
road to the Roman plan. Can it be taken as an ac
cident or shall it be accepted as a sign and portent
that there is also at Los Angeles a general who has
crossed the Rubicon?
Where, the soothsayers? Will not some one bag
and unbowel a gull and study the peristaltic signs of
its interior? The new Democracy is abroad in the
land, and so are other troubles. Where is Zadkiel
and his almanac?
If the story be true that the publication in Germany
of Coghlan's song' about the Kaiser has had the
effect of inclining the people to favor the scheme
of increasing the navy, then our German cousins have
taken the joke entirely too seriously. It was intended
the burden. of the ditty should be a josh and not an
increase of taxation.
When the police have effectively closed the gam
bling rooms that have been running openly, it will be
a good plan to start after those which have been
working on the slyâ but not so very' sly as to be out
of reach of any one wishing to gamble.
The report that the forces of Aguinaldo have been
routed again probably means they have moved out
of the way of our rifles to another hiding-place in the
rice swamps or the jungles and are as much of a fight
ing force as ever.
LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.
THE FIBER INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA,
To the Editor of The Call: C. P. Huntington, at a recent banquet, parked
that in California we are neglecting many most important things ami in '"*'>
named that of the fiber industry. which in France, Germany, Italy ana
European countries is very highly regarded and cared for. . i_,i_,.
Why is it totally neglected here? Have we no land suitable for it, no die moor
eager for the employment it gives and no capital ready nor citizens enterprises
enough to develop so legitimate and profitable an industry, which, Â«a , *-"S me
world for its market, is capable of almost unlimited expansion? We nave an
these, and feel sure it is only necessary to point the facts out clearly â¢ insure
proper attention by our enterprising capitalists and land owners to this imporwni
matter. . Â . if ,-_
Our farmers now find little profit in the old-time cereal crops, whicn at low
current, prices are scarcely worth growing. They are looking for new ana more
profitable crops to raise, hence the successful attention that is now beginning -o
be given to sugar beets, flax and hemp, ail of which are yearly increasing.
Flax is a good, profitable crop for pur rich, moist lands, easily raised, ana
with recently improved machines bids fair to occupy before long a. prominent
place in our farmers' regard. Its great and almost only drawback is the nana
â¢weeding required to insure its success and that of sugar beets. But no nana
weeding is needed for the growth of flax's twin sister, hemp. This is the most
profitable crop that our -farmers can put into the ground. There is no intensive
farming required, no difficulty in the germination of seed, as in the case or sugar
beets; no expensive hand weeding, as is necessary with flax. ' All our farmers
know, well how to prepare their land and how to seed and cover and. later mow
grain for hay close to the ground. This is exactly the procedure for hemp. =>eiect
moist, loamy landâ island, river bottom or irrigated is best- prepare well as if for
grain-hay, and about April 15 to May 31 sow broadcast fully one to one and a
half bushels per acre of good Japanese hemp seed if possible grown one year
in this State to insure its youth and fecundityâ and nothing more is needed until
90 to 100 days later; the twelve to fifteen feet high stalks are cut down by the
usual mower. The stalks are at present then rotted or "retted" in the field by
the winter's rains, and about March or April are stacked in heaps, dried by the
sun and then decorticated by a very crude machine into 1500 pounds per acre" or
dark, poor hemp "fiber,"- which sells locally to Eastern buyers at about 4 cents
per. pound here free on board cars here.* This pays $60 per acre, of which $30
covers all expenses, having $30 net profit, a. fair result, but handicapped by the
long wait of nine months after harvest before the farmer gets his pay for crop
and labor, as well as by the injury to the quality the hemp fiber by the long
exposure to weather and the defective method of decortication. But all tins is. we'
learn, to be avoided in the near future, as a few public-spirited citizens are
making a most praiseworthy effort to make and put in the field next harvest
some of the latest improved and well vouched for new decorticators. These ma
chines do rapid and effective work in the field the day the hemp stalks are
mowed down, securing one-third more fiber per acre of double the old quality and
sale value, besides saving nine months' delay to the farmer in receiving payment.
This higher quality sells for 8 cents a pound East, and thus nearly doubles the
farmer's profit per acre, which will no doubt largely and rapidly ' increase Our
â¢hemp acreage and our farmers' and land owners' ; prosperity. We therefore be
speak for this movement from our citizens the attention and favor its merits and
benefits deserve, and wish it heartily every success. A. BANNISTER.

that the Chronicle is following the advice of R. W. Emerson, who. said, "Say
what you think to-day, even though you contradict what you said yesterday."
To say the least, it is pretty hard to tell which side of the fence the Chronicle
is on. -. â :â¢;.- :
In its* editorial of April 23 it takes our acquisition from Mexico in 1847 as
"An Object Lesson in Expansion" and tries to make it a parallel case 'with
the one which now confronts us. It is" true that our acquisition from Mexico
proved to be a wise policy, but. the Chronicle docs not mention the discovery
of gold, which turned the eyes of the whole world and started the tramping
of tens of thousands of feet in the direction of the Gold Gate, enabling Cali
fornia to step into the sisterhood of States without the previous formation of
a territorial government, thereby becoming the bright-eyed Athena of this
great .republic. .: .
There are in the' Philippines about 1200 islands, aggregating 114 WO square
miles, which is only three-fourths as large as the State of California, and they
now have a population of 10,000,000 half civilized people. Think of it! Take
fourths of California and put 10,000,000 people on it and place 6000 miles
away and then what would be the sole advantage in retaining it? Nothing but
its commerce. There could be no other advantage.
And now (aside from national dignity, for we have already put our foot into
it and to back out Is cowardly) I say is it good policy tor a republic that was
born in the blood of rebellion, and that could never have thrown off the shac
kles of oppression had it not been for the aid of foreign power, is it good policy
I repeat, for a republic that has so dearly learned the blessings of freedom and
self-government to subjugate a poor, down-trodden, tax-eaten and battle-beaten
people who are fighting for self-government and a freedom that is peculiarly
adapted to their own understanding, yea, a subjugation that must come at the
expense of. maintaining an army of 100.000 and may be 300,000 men, a great per
centage of whom will lay down their lives at their post of duty? Yours truly

DEWEY DAY AT MOUNT TAMALPAIS,
To the Editor of The Call: There was no trouble or dissatisfaction of any
kind at the Mount Tamalpais Military Academy in connection with the ob
servance of Dewey day. Our headmaster. Mr. Crosby, is an enthusiastic Ameri
can and a strong supporter of the administration and Its policy toward the Phil

as the masters, against taking a whole holiday on that day. Respectfully yours

DEATH FLOATING
IN THE FUMES OF
BURNT GARBAGE
A. Vetter's Son Killed
by a Nuisance.
THE FATHER'S PITIABLE TALE
â * â
1 SENSATIONAL TESTIMONY BE
FORE JUDGE HEACOCK.
.. - â -â¦
Nauseating Stenches, Charred Bits of
Paper and Disgusting Rags
Floating Over a Large
Area of the City.
I Testimony of the most damaging char
[ acter was given before United States
Commlsioner Heat yesterday morning
; against the garbage crematory, testimony
to the effect that the fumes from the
smokestack of the Sanitary Reduction
Works were dealing death and disease
around the neighborhood. The testimony
is being taken by Commissioner Heacock
for Judge Moorrow of the United States
Circuit Court, to be submitted for the
purpose of the trial.
The witness who gave the most sensa
: tional testimony of the day was August
\'<-!t'-r, a blacksmith and horseshoer
I Whose shop* is on Ninth street, between
i Bryant and Brannan. Mr. Vetter swore
; that shortly after the so-called sanitary
crematory had been put in operation his
| son, a robust, healthy boy of 18 years of
! age, was taken sick. A doctor was called
in and he declared that the cause of the
â  boy's sickness was the fumes from the
smokestack of the crematory. The boy's
sickness lasted for three months, at the
end of which period he died.
Vetter said that whenever the wind
blew from the southeast the most sicken
ing odors were carried into his residence
through the windows and doors. In fact,
j so- great was the nuisance that Mr. and
- Mrs. Vetter were obliged to keep the win
dows closed tightly all night, every night
! in the week, without regard to the direc
i tion of the wind, for that might change
when they were asleep and allow the
stench from the burning garbage to per
meate the air of the house. Not only had
they to contend with that, but they were
annoyed and their health was endangered
| by bits of charred paper and rags flying
j In at the windows and littering the vara
' whenever the wind happened to be blow
j ing in their direction. Vetter added that
I the nuisance had become so unbearable
that he had been obliged to begin a suit
in the Superior Court to have the crema
. Tory abated.
Tills testimony was taken in the suit of
j the Sanitary Reduction Works of San
i Francisco and others against the Califor
nia Reduction Company and others to
prevent the defendant from continuing in
I the business of burning garbage, the com
plainant alleging that by the terms of a
contract made with the Board of Super
visors the sanitary works had the exclu
sive privilege of burning all the garbage
. collected in San Francisco and of charg
ing htc scavengers a fee for that service
The taking of testimony will be conclud
ed in a day or two, and the transcript will
then be delivered to Judge Morrow for Ilia
perusal. Among the defendants are a
large number of scavengers who are ac
cused of refusing to take their loads to
the sanitary works and who Insisted on
Ithe sanitary burned at the opposition es
having them burned at the opposition es
tablishment.
THE HEANEY
APPEAL WILL
BE FOUGHT OUT
A Knotty Problem for
Democrats.
â â¦ â
PHELAN DEEPLY INTERESTED
â â¦â â
HE WIRES THE COMMITTEE ASK
ING DELAY.
â¦ââ
The Absence of a Quorum Makes It
Easy for the Members to Grant
the Mayor's Re
quest.
- â
Mayor Phelan is aware,' apparently
that there Is "somethin* doln' " In Dem- ;
ocratic politics that may not inure alto- I
gether to his benefit. He was in Los I
Angeles yesterday at the hour scheduled I
j for the meeting of the executive commit
tee of the Democratic State Central Com \ â¢
; mlttee, but he manifested enough inter- \
j est in the event to be represented by Col
onel W. P." Sullivan Jr., who showed a
telegram from - his Honor containing the
. request that the committee should ad
. journ to some date at which he could be
present. The fact that there was not a i
j quorum of the members present made it i
easy to comply with the Mayor's request !
and the meeting adjourned until next '
Thursday afternoon at 2 o'clock at the
; California Hotel.
Phelan's interest in the meeting of the i
committee is accounted for by the knowl
edge that that body proposes to take up
and dispose in some way of the appeal of
VJ . J. Heaney, in which he asks the State I
Central Committee' to declare the local
committee of one hundred to be an ille
gal and undemocratic body; The fact that
1 helan is, to all intents and purposes, the
; entire committee of one hundred, readily
accounts for his desire to be present
; when his political existence is being men
aced. The mere fact that the Heaney
appeal is being taken up at this late date j
shows beyond a question, even if it i
, were not rumored about, that Chairman
Mann and other members of the execu- !
tive committee have arrived at the con
'â¢_ elusion that the hundred should be dissi
: pated in the interest of party harmony. â 
Phelan, of course, is expected to fight !
the appeal on the ground that his hun
dred is a local and not a State political
'. body, for which reason he will claim the ,
State Central Committee has nothing to
do with it. The supporters of the
Heaney resolutionâ and there are Indica
tions, that they are In the majorityâ will
answer this contention with the other,
' that, as the hundred was organized at
| the direction of the State Central Com
mittee, that body certainly has control
of it.
At the meeting yesterday there were
only four of the members of the execu
tive committee present in the flesh. They
; were Chairman Seth Mann, Prison Di
-1 rector R. M. Fitzgerald. C. C. Wright of
Los Angeles and J. L. Gallagher. Four
others were represented by proxies. Mann
holding those of J. H. Sewell of Mendo- |
I cino and J. J. Dwyer. Gallagher holding
j those of Kassin of Santa Cruz and Dun
i bar of Sonoma. The meeting was short,
I Mann notifying the members of the com
t mittee of the receipt of the telegram from
; Phelan. and suggesting that, as notice
lof the meeting .had been mailed to the
Mayor during his absence, it might be a
' good plan to accede to his request. There
| were no objections, and a motion to ad
journ until next Thursday was carried.
Prison Director Fitzgerald voicing the
sentiment that at that time the commit
tee should take up and finally dispose of
the Ueaiiey appeal.

THE CRIME IS BATTERYâ B. S., City.
This correspondent asks: "Is it a crime
for a man to force blood from a cut on
his finger down the throat of a young
woman, even though it was claimed to
have been done in fun? If so, what is
the offense?" It is to be presumed that
the act of the man (who by the way
should have been dealt with in a sum
mary manner by some abled-bodied male
relative or friend of the young woman)
was against the will of the young woman. *
That being the case he was guilty of the
crime of battery. A man who would
commit such an act, even though in fun,
as he claimed, should be introduced to
one of the Police Judges by means of a
warrant of arrest.

SCOTT - BOWNE, Chemists. New YoA.'TIS THE THING TO
GO SEE THE DOGS
Fashion Lends Its Presence at the
Kennels.
WHAT ONE HAY SEE.
TTESTERDAY the sexes were more I
V equally represented at the dog show. '
â  the I g show.
j The gentler and the sterner vied with j
each other in their attentions to the
bow-wows. Men stood around and ad
mired the wee specimen .>. the canine â 
tribe, and as. a return compliment women
stood in awful admiration in front of the
St. Rernard. Newfoundland and Great
Dane kennels.
At the "freak end" there were fresh
flowers and many a dog lived up to the !
fashionable standard of its mistress by j
showing off a new cushion and ribbon j
The owners of pet canines were very I
much in evidence. They sat the entire j
day at the kennel side of their pets,
cheering their captives with tender, lov
ing phrases and soft caresses. These
faithful ladies varied the monotony of
the long day by exchanging alls, thus
managing to put in some time with al- :
most every "cute dog" In the show. ;
Interest around the judging ring was j
more lively than at the opening, and fre- j
â¢quent applause greeted the lucky dog i
who led off with a blue ribbon.
"Fashion" cam-* in small cliques to the !
show. Swell misses in bunches of twos or i
threes made the rounds, duly admired all
the animals, bought a catalogue, took a I
long, wise look at the judge and de- !
parted. j
The crowd had a more "doggy" look i
than on the opening day. There were
men there whose dress and figure and
general appearance betrayed their love
for and knowledge of dogs. These stood
around the judges' stand and noticed i
leveryI every move made by the animals and the â 
judges. Lacey showed the latest in dog
judging clothes in tan and gray. '

THE POINTER PUZZLE.
Are the Sporting Dogs to Be
Bred for the Bench or for
Field Purposes?
Interest in the bench Fhow of yesterday
8 centered in the judging of the sport
: classes, which include pointers and
â 
is. already stated in The Call, pointers
_ setters were the observed of all ob
vers. and naturally a large and inter
ert. crowd gathered around the ring to
Judge Lacey put the canines through
at is commonly called â¢'the judge
"'rruman was. not highly pjeaaed.-or
ted with the decisions given to Irish
ters* because of the fact that his high
ss stud dogs, or in other word the
j genitors of stock that have been dis
ed of by Truman, won laurel over
ir dies."'
Ithnugh Truman was not .favorably
â¢ressea with the awards as rendered
the judge, the consensus of opinion
ong sportsmen was that he should
*c felt highly elated because of the
t that his old stock received most fa
able notice through the success
leved by their offspring.
he pointers were a very choice lot,
IT Judge Lacey found the task of seg
gregating the Rood from the middling i<\
no means easy. Of course his decisions
werejseyerely criticized by those who pro
fess to know all about dogs, their good
and bad points, etc., but a judge of a
bench show would be the most astonished
being on earth :f he discovered after a
day's experience in the ring weeding the
chaff from the grain' that there were
among the exhibitors few if any "kick
ers." Every bench show has its "kick
ers," and without- those "never satisfied
beings" a' bench show would cease to be
come an attraction to at least the sport
ing fraternity.
Something that puzzled many exhibitors
was the reversal of decisions by the judge
In some of the pointer classes. .In the
open class, for Instance. Ashbury beat
Aiex C and Cuba of Kenwood, but when
the dogs met again luring the evening
session the decisions of the afternoon
were reversed. The judge explained the
reason for the reversals by stating that
in the open class he judged the dogs from
a bench show standard (.doubtless â he
judged tln-m according to Stonehenge,
who is a recognized authority on dogs and
the points connected with even well
mart and generally recognized kinds)
and also from a standard that he con
siders applicable to the field. Ashbury,
according to the judge's Idea, is the better
dog on the bench, but in the field he is
an inferior animal *o Alex C.
The question now at variance is what
object has the sportsman In breeding and
raising pointers.' Shall the pointer be
come a bench show dog exclusively or _
dog used for field trial purposes? "if, ac
cording to Judge Lacey; a dog must have
certain qualifications to insure him a blue
or red ribbon on the bench what then is
the use of exhibiting a .field trial winner
if his chances of success are rill? The
judge has certainly cast out a Chinese
puzzle to the pointer men, which will give
them food for thought for some time to
come.
Lacey'*? decisions, so far as the grey
hounds were concerned, were extremely
bad. 01 ing Ski. an imported dog, first
over _;..â¢â  Island Boy and especially vic
tor King, astonished even 'he tyros of the
coursing game. Any man with half an
eye should certainly see that Swedish did
not compare in any way with Systematic,
â¢till Swedish won the blue ribbon. Evi
dently Mr. Lacey Is not well up on the
points of the greyhound. The judging will
be continued to-day and will doubtless
finish on Saturday afternoon.

JUDGE BELCHER AFFIRMS.
THE RIGHT OF BICYCLISTS,
SUSTAINS, THE DECISION OF
THE JUSTICES' COURT.
Drivers Are Held Responsible for Ac
cidents When on the Wrong
Side of the Road.
! Superior Judge Belcher decided a case
: yesterday which is of particular interest
alike to wheelmen and to the users of
other vehicles. The case was an appeal
from the Justices' Court, where judgment
was obtained for the plaintiff. Judge
: Belcher sustained the ruling of the court
! below.
W. T. Macfarlane, a wheelman, was the
plaintiff, being represented by the law
firm of Adams & Adams, who also repre
sent the California Associated Cycling
Clubs in cases of this character. Mr. Mac
farlane, while riding a wheel on Golden
Gate avenue in a westerly direction and
on the right hand side of the road, was
run into by a wagon driven by John
Weber, who was coming down Golden
Gate avenue. Weber was on the wrong
side of the road.
Judge Belcher's opinion was an oral one,
but in deciding the case he reviewed thor
oughly the law of this State and of Can
ada. He held that while it might appear
a hardship in a case which might seem
merely an unavoidable accident. -yet from
the fact that defendant was driving on
the wrong side of the street he must be
held answerable. A person found on that
portion of the highway to Which he has
not the. statutory right must '"' __?'_ an "
swerable for a collision resulting with one
who was on the right side of the thor
Â°The officials of the California Associated
Cycling Clubs are prosecuting vigorously"
all drivers who run down wheelmen while
the latter are riding in the proper place.

CHRISTIAN ENDEAVORERS'
QUARTERLY CONVENTION
INTERESTING SESSION OF GOLD
EN GATE UNION.
Exercises in the First Presbyterian
Church Drs. Mackenzie, Dille
and Coyle Deliver Ad
dresses.
The forty-ninth quarterly convention of i
Golden Gate Christian Endeavorers was
held in the First Presbyterian Church,
corner of Van Ness avenue and Sacra
mento street, last night. C. M. Whitney
presiding. The church was well filled,
and the proceedings were decidedly inter
esting. Addresses were made by Dr. Mac
kenzie, pastor of the church in which the
convention was held; 1 >rs. Dllle and Coyle, \
and George R. Lowell of Oakland.
The proceeding- were opened by .-i praise
service, conducted by Professor Fleisch
ner and orchestra, followed by devotional
exercises led by 11. 11. Bell, D.D. The
routine business of the convention was
then taken up. It consisted of reports of
the various committees and occupied but
a few minutes. Mr. Lowell delivered a
brief address on the preparations for the
holding of the State convention at Oak
land during the present year, and after a
solo by J. George Gibson. D.D., Dr. Dille
was Introduced to speak on "Personal
Responsibility In Christian Endeavor
Work." . The Oakland divine's remarks
were directed to pointing out to the young
toll's the necessity of continued and well
directed effort in the field of Christian
endeavor, and be urged them to not over
look the fact that the results of their la
bors depended on the personal effort put
into the work which they had volunteered
to perform. Dr. Coyle' s address on the
"Missionary Spirit in <_'. E. Work" was
along the same lines. He called attention
to the fact that Christ was the greatest
missionary of all, and said the example
furnished "by him should be an inspiration
to all those who believed in and were en
gaged in promulgating his teachings.
"The Battle Hymn of Missions ' was
then sung, by Rev. Mr. Gibson, the entire
convention joining in singing the chorus
standing, and the programme was con
cluded by Dr. Mackenzie, who spoke upon
the efficacy of prayer in Christian En
deavor work. At the close of his address
the pastor dismissed the gathering with
a benediction.

showers in the northern portion of California
on Friday morning.
The temperature has risen over all the
country west of the Rocks Mountains, except
along the California coast from San Francisco
southward to San Diego, where* probably be
cause "i fog there has been. a slight fall. The
temperatures are more nearly normal In Cali
fornia than they have been for some time pre
vious.
There has been no rainfall in the State during
the past twenty-four hours.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. May 4.â The stock market was (
weak most Of the day. then rallied, recovering
part of the earlier loss and left off 'with an \
uncertain tone, with net losses of a substan
tial fraction prevailing. Unfounded rumors
were rife, including stories of a split between
prominent bull interests, the death of a promi
nent banker and statements that banks had;
called loans and refused further accommoda
tions to a large Interest. Each of these rumors
In turn was positively denied, but not until
substantial declines in stocks had been effected,
London was a liberal selier. Sugar was most
prominent in the period of 'depression, drop
ping over 9 points, two-thirds of which â¢ was
afterward recovered. The rest of the market
followed the fluctuations in sugar to a minor
extent. The iron and steel stocks, local trans
portation shares. Anaconda and a number of
the other specialties made an average supreme
drop of about 8 points, while there w.ere nu- ;
merous declines of about 1 point. With the
rally In sugar substantial recoveries occurred
elsewhere, particularly in those which were
most depressed previously, and the market
thereafter became dull. Consolidated '".as was
well taken and rose over 3 points. Among the
railways Burlington, which sells ex-rights to
morrow, displayed the most strength. There
were fractional, advances In Continental To- |
bacco, Tennessee Coal and Iron and General j
Electric. The most prominent net declines I
were in New York Central, the coalers, local
traction companies, ron and steel shares and I
most of the grangers. There were many of the
opinion that heavy liquidation for me impor
tant interests occurred to-day and that much
of the latti-r's strength came from the cover
ing of shorts. An Interest which it was re
ported was seeking to reduce its line In its
specialties denied that it had any speculative
ventures on foot just now. Commission house
business was said in be the smallest for some
time.
Railroad bonds showed a reactionary tend
ency for the greater part of the day, but later,
owing to conspicuous strength in Wisconsin
Central firsts and support to other speculative
lssuis, imparted a better tone. Total sales,
$8,300,000.
United States 3's coupon and the new 4's cou
pon declined %. but the s's coupon advanced

BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, May 4.â Bradstreet's of May 6
will say: Widespread business activity and
heavy financial transactions, resulting from or
consequent upon the large number of Industrial
combinations planned or executed during the
month of April, seem to have been largely
responsible for the heavy bank clearings re
ported for that month, because stock specula
tion was quieter than in March or the pre
ceding months. The April clearings, in fact,
deserve special notice, because though they
i were smaller by 5 per cent than the aggregate
for March, this was owing chiefly to the smaller
: number of business 'lays in that month, because
i the average dally clearings were heavier than
; the like averase for the nionth of March. In
percentage gain. too, the increase shown over
April a year ago was the heaviest noted this
year, and the result is a further enlargement
of the gain reported for the calendar year over
recent i 'receding periods.
The aggregate bank clearings for the month
just closed. were 38,266,. a gain of 65.5 per
cent over April 1 a year ago, an' increase of 102
pec cent over the month of April, 1897, a gain
of 122 per cent over the corresponding month
in 1894, .'and an increase of 63 per cent over the
like period of 1892. The heavy gain for April :
compares with an Increase of 54.6 per cent dur- I
j ing the month of March, of 25.7 per cent In I
February and of 41.3 per cent in January over
corresponding periods of last Â«year.
Relatively the best showing for April, as In- !
. deed for many preceding months, was that i
1 made by the Middle States group of cities. In
this section the increase reported over April
a year ago was in excess of 89 per cent, the
next heaviest gain being that reported by the
New England cities, 4-* per cent.
Other considerable gains are. those of 23 per
cent In the Southern cities, 13.7 in the Western
group, and 11.3 In the Northwestern. As for
some time past, the gains in the Southwest
: and the far Western groups have been com- '
paratively moderate, but even here the Increase
have ranged from 6 to 8 per cent.
a rather better showing is naturally made
by the individual cities than was reported in
March. The gain at New York is heavier than â 
it was In that month. 94 per i jit In April, [
against 72 per cent in March, and the increase !
in the rest of the country in April was 23.::
per cent, against 27 per cent in March. In the
cithern group the large gain by Baltimore,
47 per cent. Is largely accountable for the in
: crease in that group as a whole, although fewer
i Southern cities show decreases than in March.
i In the west the heavy decrease reported by
â  Omaha, 29 per cent, due to the withdrawal of
some banks' clearings from current totals, is
i a notable feature. Boston's clearings In April
1 were very heavy, and the gain over a year ago,
'; 52 per cent,, is a notable one. The gain shown
by Philadelphia equals this; however. Chi
cago shows a gain of 14.5 per cent over a year
ago. Activity in the iron trade is reflected by
I the gain of 78 per cent at Pittsburg. St. Louis
shows a gain of 1-3 per cent, as does San Fran
cisco. â¢ â¢ - . â¢
For the four months period of the calendar
year the clearings aggregate $32,406,437, a
gain of 46.4 per cent over- 1891 of 37 per cent
over 1597, of 120 -per cent over 1-.94, and of 53
per cent over 1892.
* In the. fourth month compilation, as In that
of April, the Middle States group, containing
the metropolis, shows the heaviest increase, 7.* .
per cent. The gain In New England is over
29 per cent, while the Increases in the North
west and South exceed 20 :*er cent In each
case. The train In the Far West for the four
months closely appproximates that shown for
April. 6.4 per cent, while the gain in the South
west is also a moderate one, 8.2 per cent.
Canadian bank clearings, while smaller than
those if March, note a heavier proportionate
cain in April than for a number of months
past. The clearings at six Canadian cities, for
the month aggregate $118,336,564, an Increase
of 19 per cent, compared with a gain of only 4
per cent In March, or less than 8 per cent in
February and less than 16 per cent In January,
while for the four months the clearings aggre
gate 5491,364,795, an increase of 9.5 per cent.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, May Freezing weather in Ne
braska and lowa, too much rain In the North
west for seeding purposes, and a reduction of
1 seven points In the condition of the Ohio crop
for the month, inspired a feeble rally in wheat

market was, however, indifferent to anything
bullish, turning weak â¢ under free liquidation
and short selling. July- ooened %c higher, at

declined to 72% c, and closed at 72%Â®72%c. Re

DECIDUOUS AND CITRUS FRUITS.
Receipts were 700 boxes Cherries and 644
chests Strawberries.
A good many adverse reports regarding the '
fruit crop have been received this week, and i
there considerable talk over the matter on I
the street yesterday. The commission merchants
are practically agreed that with the single ex
ception of Peaches the crop of orchard fruits
will be light this year, and they look for good
prices and an active trade in consequence.
Strawberries are the weakest fruit on the
list. Cherries and Gooseberries are steady at
about previous prices. The few Apricots that
come about half a dozen crates a dayâ sell
very slowly, as they are small and inferior.
Citrus Fruits are quiet. Oranges are in mod

AFTER WINNING IN A 810 GAL
LOP.
Reopening Day of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Flimsy Sport
That Failed to Please.
Devereux Backed.
The exiled Pacific Coast Jockey Club
now holds possession of the Oakland race
track. Yesterday the Ingleside associa
tion commenced what will be the closing
meeting of the racing season. Its at
tendance was not large, and if half as
ninny people are present this afternoon
many smart ones will miss their guess.
A morsel of turf history will explain it
all.
One day during the preceding meeting
of the club named Pat Morrissey won a
race and was disqualified in favor of the
Corrlgan entry, Adolph Spreckels. It was
a selling affair and Corrigan's horse 'Â»--*
given a substantial "boost" by "Butch"
Fisher, a well-known trainer and owner.
A few days later Fisher captured a race
with Pot^nte, after which the Hawthorne
turfman stepped nut and, bidding up the
winner, secured the animal. This was tit
for tat, and the brace of turfmen shook
hands. It was not a Masonic shake,
though. Yesterday Fisher started a re
cent purchase of his. Dare 11. in the third
race, and the- horse won in a big gallop.
Personne finishing second. rrigan fur
nished the 3 to 10 favorite Sardonic, which
ran fourth. At the stretch turn Dai was
pinched on the rail, which imping was
caused by "Colonel Roosevelt" Pig
gott on the favorite and Macklin,
with the le_r up on Red Glenn,
a "lobster" by the looks of the
betting. Jenkins took his mount up, and
traveling around his field won as before
mentioned. After weighing In Glover, the
rider of Personne, was called Into the
stand by Judge Smith, and then Jenkins
was surhmoned before the tribunal. Pa
trol Judpe Moore was next questioned and
the doom of Dare \va.s read on their
faces. Fisher had bearded the lion In his
den and must suffer. Dare was disquali
fied amid the hoots and howls of the dis
gusted spectators. It might also be men
tioned that Personne was backed from 20
down to 10 and 12.
The card throughout was a ragged
looking one, permitting of four lopsided
favorites winning.
A carefuliy planned coup was executed
in the two-year-old event. â  vereux . a
colt by Puryear 1 rizelda, with Jenkins â¢
on his back, and backed from 20 down to
7 10.1. won imposingly from a big field of
youngsters. Always in front, he finished
three lengths ahead of Tanobe at the
wire. Armistice, the 4 to 5 favorite, rid
den by Piggott, ran unplaced.
With Pelxotto scratched from the intro
ductory event, a mile selling run, Social
ist, the mount of Jenkins, closed favorite.
The bay gelding led from the start, win

TUB BAN FKAKCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1899.
AN AGED TEACHER
FINALLY RETIRES
Close of a Career of a Quarter Century
in College of Pharmacy.
WILLIAM T. WENZELL, Emeritus Professor.
AFTER an honorable career of twenty-seven years a? professor of chem
istry in the Pharmaceutical Colege, William T. Wenzell has resigned.
His threescore y< ars ami ten rest heavily on the educator, and he has
retired to his ranch at Napa, where he will spend the waning years of
his life. As a token of appreciation of his ability as an instructor and his
long connection with tho College of Pharmacy, he was made emeritus pro
fessor. This is purely an honorary title, conferred in recognition of con
scientious and unremitting labor.
The dean of tho college, William M. Searby, speaks highly of Professor
Wenzell. "He is one of the oldest and most highly respected Instructors on
the Pacific Coast," Bays Mr. Searby. "Last year he suffered a severe at
tack of la grippe, which lowered his vitality and deprived him of that
evenness of temper bo necessary in an instructor."
Back of the resignation of Professor Wenzell is a story of the disaffection
of the'junior class at the College of Pharmacy and of friction between the
professor and his pupils. A meeting was held in November last to deter
mine whether, the students Bhould continue their year's work in chemistry,
or, on the other hand, request the faculty to provide another instructor.
The pupils claimed that advancing years had so reduced the efficiency of
their professor that he was unable to cope with forty active, energetic
students. The matter was presented to the faculty and the students under
stood that another lecturer would be provided. This was not done, how
ever, and tli-' class took matters Into their own hands.
The- entry of Professor Wenzell to the classroom was invariably thÂ»> sig
nal for a noisy demonstration, making the delivery of a lecture Impossible.
When the examination in chemistry was held last week not a student ap
peared either in the classroom or on the college grounds. Professor Wen
zell resigned at once. 'Die faculty conferred upon him the title of Emeri
tus professor as recognition of his splendid work for the college during the
quarter of a century he has been one of its foremost figures. i

The fight for the guardianship of little
Ida Aubrey again occupied the attention

A Minute After Their Departure the

Working Was Annihilated

908 Broadway, May 4.
When Foreman Wunderliek detected the
fumes of something burning in the mix
ing house at the California Powder Works
to-day lie at once gave the order to the
ten Chinese employes to run away. They
did not hesitate a second, but ran like
hares and saved their lives. Before they
had fairly reached a place of safety a
terrific explosion threw some of them to
the ground and the valuable plant and
mixing house was instantly reduced to a
heap of smoking ruins.
A few minutes after 9 o'clock this morn
ing the sound as of thunder coming from
the bay shore north of Oakland pro
claimed another explosion. People are so
familiar with this sound that no one asks
the cause of it, but there is an immediate
rush to -i. -phones to inquire how many
lives have been lost.
This morning's accident was one of the
most wonderful on record, for although
the damage was very great not a single
life was -:. and the total Injury to hu
man beings was a few scratches on a la
borer's head. In this regard the explosion
has made a record.
When J. Wunderllck, the foreman, was |
In the mixing-house his practiced nostrils
detected the odor nt burning wood pulp,
which is used in the manufacture of dyna
mite. He spent but a few seconds trying
to determine the cause of the smoke, and
then yelled to the Chinese to fly as fast )
us their legs could carry them. Wunder
lick says he doesn't remember just what
he said, but he believes that no Apache
whoop could equal the yell he gave warn-
Ing the Chinese to flee. They had gone
several hundred yards when the place, in j
the language of powder works, "went !
up." The name which the foreman had j
seen In the main mixing-room had reached
a tank of explosive material and a second
later many of ;he Hying Chinese were j
knocked off their feet and others were
dodging clouds of living fragments.
Chris Fass, a laborer, was driving a car ;
on the track leading from the mixing- i
house to the entrance to the works. The
concussion was so great that he was
thrown from the car and struck by flying |
splinters, which scratched his head, but (
Inflicted no serious injury.
The wreck is very complete, but the
daman-' will not exceed $6000. A few min
utes Lfter the explosion the employes sub
dued some flames which had spread to ad
joining sheds and then proceeded to clear
away the mass of splintered lumber, |
tanks, broken machinery and maze of j
pipework. There is never any danger In
the ruins of an explosion at the powder!
works, for every one knows that nothing
explosive could possibly be found within
any reasonable distance of a mixing- |
house that has gone up. The building j
was erected a few months ago and was a :
very elaborate plant. It took the place !
of a mixing-house that went up over a â¢
year ago. The company has a duplicate
dynamite plant. and Superintendent
Bermlngham says that In a few days work
will be (â â int.- "ii as though there had been
no explosion this morning.

NO MORE JOSHES IN
THE BLUE AND GOLD
BERKELEY, .May Prompted by
the tone of the last Blue and
Gold, recently Issued by the ju
nior class of the University of
California, the members of the faculty
have decided that henceforth no
more lampooning and caricaturing of
professors and students will be al
lowed in the college annual. In addi
tion to this they have followed up
their action of a week ago in dismiss
ing from college the editor-in-chief,
Stuart A. Masters by meting out the
same discipline to the manager.
George Brehm. A notice was posted
on the bulletin board to-day by order
of the Academic Council dismissing
Brehm from the university.
Brehm undertook the work of get
ting out the Blue and Gold in con
junction with Masters shortly after
the beginning of last term. The two
have worked indefatigably'nt the pub
lication for several months past, striv
ing to outdo all their predecessors both
it: the extent of the book and in the
originality of its "joshes." They
succeeded in getting out the largest
annual which has ever been issued
at liege, but, according to the views
of the faculty, their originality went
a little too far and so the professors
have concluded once and for all that no college editor is to indulge any
more in indiscriminate Joshing.
The notice announcing the action of the Academic Council with regard to
Brehm was prepared by a committee consisting of Professors George H.
Howison, E. W. Eiilgard and W. 'â :. Bitter. it reads In part as follows:
The university cannot allow itself to lie discredited by. any unseemly publico.!
purporting to represent the university life and spirit. - /
The recent Issue of "The Blue and Gold" is unseemly; in its Insults to fellow
students, especially to the young women; in its personal attacks on the university au
thorities, Including the president of the board of regents; in the low and coarse char
acter of certain pictures, jests and Innuendoes.
The president ami the committee think it reasonable, and rule:
That no student publication can l.- tolerated which tends to discredit the univer
sity In the community at large and in the sisterhood of reputable universities. Of
this tendency the council is to be the judge.
That the so-called "josh" element, used for ridicule, slur or personal attack
tending to bring its objects Into contempt or disrespect, must in the future be omit
ted from all student publications.
That nothing 'an be permitted which verges on coarseness or Indecency.
That Manager Brehm. who admits ins equal responsibility with the chief editor
for the objectionable features of the present Issue of "The Blue and Gold," be, and
hereby if, dismissed from the university.
That all the staff of "The Blue and Gold," both editorial and Managing, be, and
hereby arc, publicly reprimanded for culpable negligence In committing themselves
blindly to such leadership.
For the Academic Council: MARTIN KELLOGG, President.
The announcement was not posted until very late this afternoon, and as
the students are In the midst of final examinations for the year, some of
them having already left the college town, it is doubtful as to how the ruling
of the faculty will be received. The petition recently presented in behalf of
Masters, In which over 1000 students asked to have him reinstated, may serve
as an Index to the opinion of the undergraduates in the matter. It is more
than likely that 'hey will be as unanimous in asking to have Brehm reinstat
ed. The Impression prevails that both Brehm and Masters have met more
than their just deserts, for while it is generally admitted that both were
indiscreet, the whole undergraduate body takes exception to the severity of
the faculty's discipline.
NEW CONTRACT FOR
WORK ON LAP MERRITT
BOARD OF WORKS NEEDS NO
FURTHER AUTHORITY.
None of the Money Raised for Im
provements Can Be Legally
Used for Any Other
Purpose.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call, j
908 Broadway. May I.
Within a few days a new contract will
be let for carrying on tin- Improvements
In and around Lake Merritt. The Board
of Works holds that it has no need of any i
further advice from the City Council, as j
the ordinance authorizing the work is -:i
effect and the courts having annulled th" j
contract therefore no contract has been
let and the board must proceed with all
possible diligence.
In view of the fact that the contractors i
through n<> fault of their own are in .1
position yvhere they are likely to lose a :
large sum of money there Is a general i
desire to award the new contract to tin m j
if possible. Of course it must be awarded i
under the law to the lowest bidder, but '
I'cterson and Johnson, the contractors, |
hay* already built their dredger and have
all the lumber on the scene and have done j
considerable work. Of course the i>r .- I
posals will be for all th.- work to be d' ne,
and it is argued that it will be Impossible I
for any other contractor unless he be
willfully anxious to lose money, to come j
in at this stage and bid as advantages I
as the contractor- who have already 1
made such a good start.
When asked about the matter to-day
Mayor Snow said that he does not believe j
any one wants to see contractors suffer
because of a technical error in their con
tract. "So far as 1 can learn." said Mr.
Snow, "there is no complaint whatever
regarding the manner in which the work
has been done, and the city should pay
for it. There may have to be some relax
ation of strict law in the matter, but
there i.^ also such a thing as equity, and
good work having been performed. I
would be very sorry to Bee the contractors
required to lose many thousands of dol
lars."
Townsend Is Discharged.
OAKLAND. May <.â Con H. Townsend.
who was charged with the murder of
John McCann, was dismissed from cus
tody to-night in the Police Court, after
the preliminary examination. The court
held that there was not sufficient evidence
â¢'â  warrant trying the prisoner in the Su
perior Court.

* \_J is being put forth to make it surpass previous affair*- of Its kind. A
â¢â > large number of tickets have already been disposed of and the committee
â¦ of arrangements is satisfied that a large crowd will attend the picnic. The
*Â£ arrangements for the outing have been left to the younger members, who are
represented on
the committer:
by Louis Rapr
and W. E. Hinz,
The latter have
secured a fine
band and have
arranged an in
teresting pro
gramme and a
good time is
promised those
who attend.
There Is nc
doubt that the
picnic will be a
success, as the
San Franclscr
Verein is noted
for its entertain
ments and out
ings. It is con
sidered one ol
the foremost or
ganizations ol
its kind on the
m coast. Its member. have succeeded in carrying off the honors at the yearly
S3 tournaments, which are participated In by representatives of other Vereins
,â¦ in this State, and it is famed for turning out good gymnasts. It started with
â¢P thirty members in 1832, and now has nearly 400 members. There are also
rl nearly the same number of boys and girls, ranging from 6 to 18 years, who
V are building up their muscles and receiving an education. A ladies' class
2? and also a choral society, composed of the daughters of the members, are
â¦ features of the organization. There are numerous other branches, and
Â«Â£ representatives of all of them will undoubtedly attend the annual outing of
4 their society. The tickets are $1 and entitle the holder to a round trip and
*2 admission to the park. The boat will leave Tiburon ferry at 9 o'clock sharp

THE SAjS FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAY, MAY 5, 1899.
i EORGE O. BREHM.
DR. ANDERSON OBEYS
THE SIGNATURE LAW
WRITES THAT HE IS NOT THE
CHARMER OF MRS. BOSCOW. " I
Says Boscow Is an Ingrate Who Had
His Benefactor Thrown Into
a Dungeon.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
908 Broadway, May i.
Dr. 11. IV. Anderson has Issued a state
ment over his signature, In which he se-
riously arraigns W. A. Boscow. the man
who Anderson claims secured the doctor's
arrest for illegally practicing. The story
told by the doctor is interesting and ex
ceedingly romantic.
Boscow has a charming wife, but at
present their relations are somewhat
strained. Mrs. Boscow Is inclined to de
fend Dr. Anderson.
Dr. Anderson, who will soon be tried
under the ordinance prohibiting doctors
from practicing without a license, de
clares that Boscow believes him guilty
of many Imaginary wrongs, and has
vented his spite by having him cast into
prison.
"After 1 had done my utmost to pro
mote his health and happiness, never re
fusing to go to his assistance* and work
ing with nim during his sickness many
dreary nights, for which I never charged
him one cent, this Christian man re
turns my kindness by having mi- thrown
into a dungeon, by bringing sorrow and
desolation to the heart .-.- my invalid wife
by accusing me of bavin- broken- up ins
home, when my wife and I have fre
quently advised his wife to remain with
her husband, if for no other reason than
for the sake of her little children," is a
portion of Dr. Anderson's defense.
W. A. Bobcow declares that Anderson
hypnotized his wife while they were liv
ing in the same house and Induced her
to leave him. Mrs. Boscow denies this
and proclaims that her husband's action
in causing Anderson's arrest is ror the
purpose of trying to connect ids name
with the divorce proceedings and to sub
ject htm to shame and dishonor.
Anderson protests that he is able to
clear himself of th.- charge and promises
to pursue Boscow to the bitter end.

KILLED WHILE ON DUTY.
Watchman Collins Found Dead Un-
der a Railroad Car.
OAKLAND, May 4.â John Collins, an
aged watchman at the railroad yards, was
found dead under a car at daylight this
morning. A train had passed over his
chest during the night while the watch
man was crossing the track for the pur
pose of attending to one of the watch
men's clocks. Collins had been in the em
ploy of the Southern Pacific through a
generation, and when increasing age
brought with it Infirmity he was given the
position of night watchman. His duties
required him to wind up certain watch
men's clocks at different points in the
yard for the purpose of showing that he
had made his rounds at the proper time.
To reach these clocks it was necessary
sometimes to walk around a long string
of cars or else climb over them or dodge
under the drawheads. It is supposed that
he was doing this when he was run over,
having probably mistaken some cars at
tached to a locomotive for some that were
sidetracked.
The deceased was missed, and near 9
track was seen a lighted lantern. An in
vestigation showed that it belonged to
Collins, and its (had owner was found a
minute later. Collins leaves a widow and
six children.

At about 1 o'clock Policeman Charles

MILITARY WEDDING
ON ANGEL ISLAND
DRUM MAJOR ARNDT MARRIED
TO MISS CLYDE KEITH.
Bride Given Away by Major Hess,
Commander of the Post, and
Chaplain Potter Performs
the Ceremony.
The soldiers on Angel Island were
treated to quite a change from the usual
routine of military life yesterday. There
was a wedding at the post and every
man in the garrison, except those on
duty, crowded the chapel to see the cere
mony performed.
The groom was Drum Major Paul Arndt
and the bride was Miss Clyde Keith of
the Presidio. The couple were made one
by Chaplain Potter of the post, and Major
Frank W. Hess, commanding officer at
Angel Island, gave the bride away. The
regimental band was in attendance and
played Mendelssohn's wedding march as
the bride and groom left the church. One
of the first to salute the newly wedded
couple was Captain Btofen of the quar
termaster's steamer McDowell. He knows
all the young people at Angel Island, Al
catraz. Lime Point, Fort Point and the
Presidio, and considers It his bounden
duty to kiss the bride at each wedding.
On this occasion he was a little late and
the groom pot the first kiss.
Drum Major' Arndt is the son of Ser
geant Otto Arndt, leader of the band.
Ie Is a universal favorite and the con
gratulations that poured in on himself
and wife were of the heartiest kind.

WANT PROTECTION.
Property Owners on the San Bruno.
Road Petition for an Engine
House.
Property-owners and residents in the
vicinity of San Bruno road and Army
street have petitioned the Supervisors for
better protection against Are in that
neighborhood. The petition was headed
by Morris Windt, who has thousands of
dollars' worth of property at the Junc
tion of the two streets mentioned, and i
other owners of realty adjacent thereto
and also several residents further 'out on
the San Bruno road. The attention of the
Supervisors is directed to the locality as
being one thickly doited by factories in
which considerable capital is invested in
machinery and other plants, all of which
would become totally destroyed in case
of a large fire breaking out in any one
of the numerous factories. To afford pro
tection against such a contingency the
city fathers are requested to provide an
appropriation for the construction of an
engine-house in the locality mentioned,
and in addition to this to notify the
Spring Valley Water Company to lay B
inch mains In place of the 4-inch ones now
In use then . as in case of fire the supply
would be entirely Inadequatae to meet the
necessity of the case.
At the present time the nearest engine
house to this place is located on Folsom
street, between Twenty-first and Twenty
second, and the time consumed in reach
ing San Bruno road in answering an
alarm would be so long that the place
attacked by lire would be beyond relief
by th. time the apparatus would reach
there.
IMPROVEMENT IN THE
CITY'S NORTH END
PLAN TO WIDEN WASHINGTON
STREET FIVE BLOCKS.
Many Property Owners Favor the
Move, but Much Must Be Done
First Question of Cost.
The proposition to widen Washington
street from Montgomery avenue to the
water front was discussed yesterday at
a public meeting called by the executive
committee of the North Central Improve
ment Association. H. P. Sonntag, the
president, in opening the meeting stated
that it is the expressed wish of quite a
number of the larger property owners in
that section of the city to have tha im
provement made by taking about twenty
five feet from the south side of the street,
so as to conform to the width of Mont
gomery avenue. It is advisable to obtain
the opinion of the majority of property
owners first, as the association is not
ready to endorse such a movement until
it could see what the outcome would be.
1.. V. Merle, representing the Montgom
ery estate on Washington street and
Montgomery avenue, stated that the old
block bearing the name of the first owner
is about to be renovated an'! repaired in a
modern style. If th.- street is to, be wid
ened be wanted to know it so as to make :
allowances for the loss of the north end.
Personally he was in favor of the im
provement and the estate was willing to
stand its share â¢'â¢' the expense. He knew
that many of the larger owners, not pres
ent, were also In favor of the change,
while those living at the farther end of
the avenue indorsed the move to a man.
Supervisor Holland stated that the Board
of Supervisors are willing to improve the
city and would certainly make arrange
ments tÂ«. carry out any plans that the ,
people of the district would advise.
George D. Shadburne ami several oth
ers suggested that it would be a very
good idea to ascertain the cost of the
proposed change, now many would be af
fected and the exact number for and
against the plan, tie stated that he had
upon good authority that the Supervisors
had decided to grant the franchise for the
corkscrew street-car line that the rail
road people want to run into the district.
Among others who were present and
spoke were William Giselman. Hugh Hud
dleson. G. H. Berton. K. R. Provines, Ed
gar Painter. George K. Fitch, R. D.
Chandler and others. No action was
taken in toe matter, the desire being to
secure information before proceeding as
to the cost of the widening and the means
of proceeding.
CARVED HIS DEBTORS.
â  â  ._.
Sing Lee Quong Stabbed Two Chinese
Undertakers Because They Would
Not Pay What They Owed.
Lung Hing and Tong Bun Sayou, un
-1 dertakers at 724 Pacific street, were
stabbed and slashed severely yesterday
forenoon by Sing Lee Quong. They had
had a dispute about money matters, and
Quong attacked them with a Chinese
machete, lacerating the muscles of the
scalp and shoulders. The wounded men
were treated at the Harbor Hospital and
the murderous assailant was placed un
der arrest by Officer Peshon.
The prisoner denies that he inflicted the
wounds. He said that he was upstairs
asleep in his room when the trouble be
gan and that he ran downstairs as an un
known Chinaman was slashing the under
takers. Quong said also that he was a
cook and that the wounded men owed
him money and would not pay him. al
though he had nothing to eat. He gavo
his age as 62 years.
Last night Sing Lee Quong told the po
lice officers that about two months ago
he had seen Ton Bun Sayou bury a child
In a vacant lot on the corner of Pacific
and Stockton streets. He was sent out in
company with two officers and after a
few minutes' digging the body was un
earthed. It was of a male Chinese child
apparently about a month old, and in an
advanced state of decomposition. Sing
Lee Quong claims he does not know who
the child's parents were.

for the past few days, was fittingly cele
brated by a banquet extended by the Uni
tarian Club of California at the Mer
chants' Club last evening. About 400 were
seated in the dining room, which was
profusely adorned with floral decorations.
Toasts, interspersed with selections by
the Press Club Quartet, were responded
to by Rev. Btopford W. Brooke, Rev.
C. J. K. Jones of Los Angeles, Chaplain
F. C. Brown, l". S. N., and Hon. John P.
Irish. Rev. Dr. Brooke touched upon,
"The Present Function of Unitarlanism,"
and Rev. Dr. Jones spoke of "The Power
of the Unitarian Pulpit." Both of the
clergymen were warmly applauded and
made the most of the subjects they han
dled.
Chaplain F. C. Brown of the battleship
lowa was heartily received when he arose
Jto speak. The subject allotted to him
| was "Theological Co-operation," and he
i handled it in a manner somewhat sur
j prising to most of his audience. His tone
was forcible, and profound attention wits
observed throughout bis remarks. He be
gan by observing that many Christian
' people who were clamoring for the Chris
i tianizing of the black man in the Philip
pines had given little thought to the
; evils prevalent at their own doors; that
i no attention has been given to the correc
tion of the thousands of crooked human
ways, or to the great absorbing monopo
lies and trade corruptions, simply because
i they were backed by wealth and power,
I and created by men born in an en-
I lightened land. As # an example of the
first he referred to pathetic cases which
had come under his observation while in
San Francisco. "A woman," he said,
i "was sentenced. to three months in the
County Jail for vagrancy. A paper in
mentioning the case stated that she was
the woman who had caused the impris
onment of the wretch responsible for her
1 downfall, a number of years ago. At the
\ time of her first sin no helping hand had
i been outstretched to save her, and now
i it has come to pass that the only mes
sage the great city of San Francisco can
; extend to this poor wretch is three
i months behind prison bars. Such a thing
i causes the finger of scorn to be pointed
at every church in the city.
"The idea of Christianity, as it is prac
i ticed to-day, is that when a life has fallen
! from grace it should no longer find refuge
lin the sanctuary of the church. Only
i those who have the mystic symbolism
stamped upon their countenances are fit
for the consolations of religion, and the
efforts of the Gospel to spread the Spirit
of God should be confined to far-away
blacks and not to the outcasts at home.
There are preachers to-day who plight
their troth in sensational sermons, the
titles of which reflect on the purity of
sacred life. They circulate nonsensical
tracts and send them to foreign lands.
All of these things have a tendency to
keep people from church rather than
draw them to it. Practical and not un
natural methods should be employed in
tha conversion of sinners, and until this
thing is understood little advancement
will be made in the way of real reform at
home or abroad.
"The theme of my remarks is 'Theolog
ical Co-operation,' and by such co-opera
tion men of the cloth will only be enabled
to execute the work they have been com
missioned to do. Religious denominations
will closet themselves in their little shells
on Sunday discussing the particular dog
mas of their creed and denouncing some.
other denomination, while us a matter of
fact they agree with the objects of their
denunciation in nine points out of ten.
When they come together and recognize
that they are all working to attain the
same end, and that the rough road will be
traveled only by hearty co-operation, and
not by dissension, then will the great
problem be solved. Chaplains of the navy
âand we are about twenty-four in num
berâmingle with our men on week days,
giving them all the benefit of bright ex
ample, and on Sunday preach of God, of
purity and heaven, and do not herald our
words with sensational headlines calcu
lated to inspire their disgust instead of
their reverence."
Rev. Mr. Brown was followed by Hon.
John P. Irish, who spoke on the Czar's
peace congress to be opened at The
Hague on the ISth of the present month.
With his usual aggressiveness of speech
Mr. Irish denounced the present war in
the Philippines and held up the acts-com
mitted by Americans upon the wounded
of the enemy as atrocities of a barbaric
period. He read portions of communica
tions received from the soldiers and when
he came to the report of Lieutenant Du
boee on the burning of the Pace Church
said Duboce was a monster. In part he
said:
"The Czar has proposed a peace con
gress. It has been treated lightly by the
nations of the earth and I regret to
think that it will result in naught. It is
to be hoped that it may accomplish one
thing, if nothing else, and that is to re
solve some means by which the weak can
be protected against the arm of the
mighty. War is becoming more brutal
and it has got to such a state that the
amusement of civilized soldiers rests in
unmercifully crushing the uncivilized man
out of existence. There should be some
revolt at the thought that men can be
permitted to burn the wounded of the
enemy like mice in a strawstack. Let
some court be afforded to which the
weak can appeal for justice."
On the effects of the present war the
speaker said: "I think that the future
will demonstrate that, at this particular
time, war has been disastrous to this
country. It has checked the flow of
peace and good will among men. Eighteen
months ago we were at peace with all
nations, but to-day we have inspired a
fear among nations that has robbed us of
our tranquil standing. At the most, war
but arouses in our hearts the sleeping ap
petites of the serpent and the shark and
breeds the desire of conquestâ that desire
to swallow up the small in a mlghly
gulp."
Kipling's poem. the speaker denounced
as -an error. He said it was intended to
overthrow a truth which had oeen estab
lished with the dawn of Christianity and
set up a theory that a wrong la right just
because it is a burden.
"ACTORS" COME TO GRIEF.
Two Eootlight "Favorites" Arrested
for Defrauding a Hotel.
Herbert Wolf and F. â¢'.. Belmont, young
men with histrionic aspirations, were ar
rested last evening by Police Officer Syl
vester and Marshal Ramage of Hay
wards. They are charged with defraud
ing D. G. Frantz, a hotel keeper of Hay
wards, out of three days' board bill.
Accompanied by another stage-struck
friend named Waldemeyer, Wolf and Bel
mont went to I lay wards, intending to
make their debut and incidentally to re
plenish their depleted purses. After rent
ing the Town Hall the trio had a number
of hand bills printed, announcing that
they would give a show at "popular
prices."
Wolf was billed as the only rival to
the great Hermann, his "tricks of leger
demain fairly dazzling the beholder."
Evidently realizing that their maiden ef
fort would not be a success, the trio
packed their grips and skipped without
having settled with the hotel man for
board. On learning of their sudden de
parture Frantz went before the. Town
Justice and swore to complaints, charg
ing them with defrauding an innkeeper.
Wolf and Belmont were found on Mar
ket street and taken back to Haywards,
where they will be tried under the State
law, which makes it an offense to "beat"
a hotel keeper. Waldemeyer has not yet
been arrested.
Lin Gow Helped Himself.
Lum Que, a Chinaman living at 1910 â¢
Pierce street, told the police yesterday af

JUDGE COOK DECIDES AGAINST
THE DEFENDANT.
â¦
Witnesses Testify That the Signa
tures on the Alleged Bogus De
mand Were Forged Ce
rtified To by Accused.
Peter W. McGlade was treated to a bit
ter disappointment yesterday morning
when Judge Cook rendered a decision over
ruling the objections of * his attorney,
Patrick Reddy, to the admission as evi
dence against him of the alleged forged
demand for street work on. which the in
dictment of the Grand Jury was based.
Ex-Street Superintendent Ambrose's for
mer bookkeeper and his attorney had
built high hopes on barring out this im
portant document and had they succeed
ed McGlade would have got off scot free
on all the charges pending against him.
As it is the evidence -will go to the jury.
In rendering his decision Judge Cook
took up the objections of defendant's
counsel one by one and disposed of them
in short order. The court held that the
contention that the document was void
on its face and therefore not a tit sub
ject for an indictment for forgery be
cause the signatures of Assistant Super
intendent of Streets 'lark and Assistant
Clerk of the Board of Supervisors Mc-
Ginnls were valueless, even if genuine,
was Insufficient ground for objection.
"The document," he said, "so far as it
travels down to the Auditor's allowance,
appears to be a demand for the payment
of money. Attached -to it is an affidavit
which purports to prove the genuineness
Of the demand. Now it Is charged that
all three signatures of Swords, Clark and
McGinnls are forged. So it comes down
to a forged document for payment with
forged evidence of its correctness. So if
the people can prove that it. is forged
â *-' far the allegations of the complaint
with regard to the making of the forgery
will have been sustained. .1.
"With regard to th.- uttering of the for
geryâfor the crime of forgery consists of
two acts, making and utteringâ the de
mand having been allowed by the Audi
tor, that portion of it containing the Au
ditor's allowance may i" open to objec
tion that no one was injured thereby. But
1. think evidence should go to the jury."
Immediately following the rendering of
the decision the introduction of evidence
going to prove the forgery and thus pav
ing the way for th.- admission of the doc
ument was begun. Hi J. Swords, in whose
name the demand was made, was re
called and swore that he had never
signed th.- paper and that he had never
worked for the Street Department. He
was followed by former Superintendent
ot Streets Ambrose, who explained the
methods in vogue In the office in regard
to' the tiling of demands and of the dis
covery of McGlade' 8 alleged crime.
Thomas .1. Clark testified thai he was
a deputy in the office "i the Superinten
dent of Streets when the bogus demand
was filed and he swore positively that he
had never affixed his signature to the '
forged document. He also testified that
while serving in the Street Department I
he had entire charge of the sewer work ;
and that Swords was never employed in
that department. - ?;-.â â 
At the afternoon session more of the
same kind of evidence was Introduced,
but not without objection on the part
of the defendant's counsel, who stub
bornly contested every point. The most
important testimony of the day was the
positive declaration of M. M. Regensbur
ger. a money broker, that the signature
of P. W. McGlade, which appears on the
back of the demand, certifying that
i .
PRINCIPAL AND SOME WITNESSES IN THE McGLAOE TRIAL.
Swords had performed work for the
Street Department in the month of
August, IS9S, for which he was entitled
to JW. was in the handwriting of the de
fendant. The witness testified that lie
was familiar with the writing of Mc-
Glade and produced a number of notes
signed by the defendant at various times
in his presence to compare with the sig
nature on the forged demand. After con
siderable sparring these were, admitted in
evidence. Regensburger is the princi
pal sufferer through the alleged forgeries j
of the defendant, as he cashed a num
ber of tags bearing McGlade's signature
as deputy superintendent of streets, cer
tifying that the bearers had performed
work for the city and the amount of com
pensation to which they were entitled, a
number of which turned out to be bogus.
Harry Piper, who was Chief Deputy
County Clerk three years ago, when Mc-
Glade was appointed to a deputyshlp in
the office of Superintendent Ambrose
was called to the stand to Identify papers
in relation to the appointment and bear
ing his file mark. Piper was troubled
with a defective memory. He could not
swear to McGlade's signature and he was
not quite sure of his own. although he
thought it looked like his writing.
T. B. McGinnls, former deputy clerk of
the Board of Supervisors, was" called to
the stand and swore that his signature
which appears on me bogus demand was
forged. He also testified as to the usual
procedure in passing upon demands com
ing from the Street Department.

and who has personal charge of all de
mands coming from the Street Depart
ment, took the stand and explained that
the demands were brought to the clerk's
office and after they were acted upon by
the board -.he notified, the Street Depart
ment bookkeeper, â¢â  who took charge of
them, giving a receipt. - *
"Do you know anything about this de
mand?" inquired -Assistant District At
torney Black, handing the witness the
forged document.
"Yes. sir; -that- passed through my
hands," was the reply.
"Have you any record of.it? was the
next question.
"I have." replied the witness, and he
produced a big book and pointed out the
entry referred to. Ryan also testified
that he had delivered a batch of de
mands to McGlade personally, including
the one which forms such an important
feature of the present trial, and had the
defendant's receipt for the same. ' An
other book, containing the receipt, was
produced and both were entered as ex
hibits on the part of the peonle.
At this point Assistant District Attor
ney Black asked for an adjournment, as
one of his principal witnesses. Kytka, the
handwriting expert, was out of the city,
and as his evidence was necessary to
show that signatures of Mediums. Chirk
and Swords were not only forged, but .
that they were forged by McGlade. In
fact, Mr. Black says that Kytka will tes
tify that the entire document, with the
exception of the signatures of the Audi
tor and the members ot the Auditing
Committee of the Board of Supervisors,
was written by McGlade. Judge Cook
