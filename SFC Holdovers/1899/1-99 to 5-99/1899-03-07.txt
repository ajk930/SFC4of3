Curse of Ingleside.
WHEREAS. The practice of horse-racing as formerly car
ried on in this city and county was intended to and
did encourage the breeding of fast horses, and such
emulation so engendered was of some material benefit to the
State; and
Whereas. While the same reason is given for the
continuance of race-meetings, it now appears, and the results
show, that the great success of these trials of speed of different
horses is because of the interest taken by the young and old of
both sexes in the purchase of pools and in the making of bets
and wagers: and
Whereas. The evil results engendered by the hope of gain on
racetracks are apparent in the disruption of homes, the dissipa
tion of savings, recklessness as to moral and social relations,
and ultimately to crime and ruin; and
Whereas. The continuance of this pernicious custom for
many years of pool-selling, otherwise gambling, being permitted
on racetracks has led to a deterioration and loss of character
of young men. whose desire to participate in this gambling has
led them to be dishonest, in peculating from their employers, and
is a potent factor in debauching young girls and women who,
atisc would be honest, virtuous and reputable mem
bers of society: and
Whereas, This board, in the interest of morality, cannot per
mit such a debauching practice being pursued, as not alone the
participants suffer, but the inno
cents have to bear the wide
reaching influences and conse
quences of this gambling; and
Whereas. This board owes it as
a <hny to the community to stop j
all nefarious practices as a nieans
of protection to those persons,
young and old. who are unable to !
exercise control over their dispo- j
sitions to acquire money by the
hazard, excitement and allure- i
inent of the gambling now being
permitted on racetracks; there
fore the people of the city and
county of San Francisco do or
dain as follows:
Section I. It shall be unlaw
ful to sell pools or to make
books or make bets or wagers
wherein money or other articles
of value arc staked as pledges on
races or other contests between
es within the inclosure of a
racetrack or in any other place in
or within this city and county.
Section 2. Tt shall be unlawful
for any person or persons, man
ager or proprietor or corporation
owning or controlling any race
track, or any other person or per
sons in or within any other place
in this city and county, to permit
the sale of pools or books or wa
gers wherein money or other ar
ticles of value are staked on
horses or other contests between
horses in this city and county or
elsewhere.
Section 3. Any person violat
ing any of the provisions of this 'â 
order shall be deemed guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon convic
tion thereof shall be punished by
a fine of not more than five hun
dred dollars ($500), or by im
prisonment of not more than six
months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.
Section 4. All orders or parts
of orders in conflict with the pro
visions of this order are hereby
repealed.
The crusado aerafnst the gipantio evil
of Ingteaide has home fruit. The peo

the race course and have taken the first j

The Ten Supervisors
nue that so many rtifn and women of
this city have traveled to dishonor and
death.
At the mectine of the Board of Su
pervisors yesterday afternoon a reso
lution of vital importance was passed
to print. Another vote of a majority
of the hoard will kill the evil that has
thrived at the expanse of so many
homes and lives in this city. By their
votes yesterday the Supervisors incor
porated into the organic law of San
Francisco an absolute prohihition
against poolsellin^ and bookmakins
within the limits of this city and
county.
The horsemen may, under this law,
race their horses ;is they please, but
' they cannot legally hazard a cent on
th>^ outcome of a race. The ordinance
that was passed to print yesterday
places no restriction upon hors^ racing.
j If the masters of [ngleside fare to d<
so, they may keep their gatos open ev
ery day In the year, hui they will be
placed under arrest if they hazard a
dollar or permit a dollar to he waK'TKI
on the issue of any contest in which
they are interested. More than this,
the Supervisors have officially decreed
that no <>ne in this city may gamble r>n
any hor.-e race whether held in Ban
Francisco 01 anywhere else.
The resolution thai was adopted yes
terday Is sweeping In its consequences,
but the Supervisors believe that des
perate remedies are the only cure fur
a desperate social disease. The prohibi
tory resolution was introduced by Su
pervisor Perrault and nine of his asso-
I elates voted with him to close the ne
farioos business of the bookmakers .n
; San Francisco. Two members of the
; board, HOWARD BLACK AND W.
!H. PHELPS, balked at the resolution.
SAX FRANCISCO, TUESDAY, MARCH 7, 1899.
These men listened to Dr. Perraulfs
arraignment of Ingleside. They heard
him tell of the destruction and death
that the gamblers of the race course
have brought to San Francisco. They
listened while Dr. Perrault told of
homes wrecked, young men led to dis
honor, suicide, prison or flight. These
worthy members of the board heard
the story of young men ruined and
women debauched and then they voted
to protect the scoundrels that have
made this city their field of evil.
Supervisor Perrault repeated the
ftory as The Call had already told it.
The grewsome records of the Morgue,
the registers of the State penitentiaries,
the history of recent crime in Pan
Francisco and the silent testimony of
wrecked lives and homes tell the story
of Ingleside. It was this story that
Dr. Perrault told yesterday to his as-
Bociates and then begged them, in
obedience to the duty they owe to the
people of the city, to destroy the evil.
The vote upon the resolution was ten
to two. The new law was started well
on its way. Another vote will be neces
sary before the resolution becomes
operative. This vote will be taken at.
the next weekly meeting of the board.
If this vote is in the affirmative, and
there is hardly a possibility that it will
be anything else, the bookmakers will
havp to seek a new field after next
Monday or fight their way through the
courts out of jail.
The resolution was presented late in
the afternoon by Supervisor Perrault.
After it had been read by the clerk
Supervisor rhelps asked why it could
not be referred to the Health and Police
Committee of the board.
Dr. Perrault then ma.de a determined
! stand that it be passed to print at once.
Ho scored the racing as now promoted,
saying: - 'I think every member of this
board knows the dire consequences and
the blighting influences that surround
i the racing at Ingleside. Our young
That Are Determined
girls and boys become dissipated and
drfrr-nerate and resort to petty larceny
to get the money with which to bet.
This evil may and sometimes does lead
them on to murder and suicide.
'Homes are wrecked and the live? of
innocents ar" blighted by this rapidly
spreading evil. I do not believe in re
ferring this matter to a committee. If
you do the only person who will appear
before that committee is 'Colonel Ma
mma.' "
Mr. Phelps ninv^ to amend to include
dog racing or coursing and the amend
ment was at once accepted by Dr. Per
rault, the maker of the original motion.
Chairman Collins of the Health and
Police Committee was indignant at the
suggestion of "Colonel Mazuma" ap
pearing before his committee. "I don't
know Colonel Mazuma," he said. "I
suppose, however, he is a gentleman
! like ourselves. I want a printed copy
of the resolution, so that we may read
It and understand the question UDon
which we are voting."
This ended the discussion. The vote
was then on passage to print and was
adopted. Those voting in favor of the
resolution were: Supervisors- Holland,
Kalben, Perrault, Lackmann, Byington,
Collins, Heyer. Deasy, Attridge and
Aigeltinger. The two voting in the
negative were Black and Phelps.
Members of the board showed their
interest in the measure which they had
adopted by expressing freely what they
know of Ingleside and its many evils.
Supervisor Holland, at the conclusion
of the meeting, said: "I have visited
the Ingleside track twice since it was
opened. The last time I was there a
girl of nineteen approached me and
said: 'How do you do, Mr. Holland!'
"I did not know her at first until she
told me her name. I knew her family
well and was shocked to see her there.
After a few moments' conversation she
left me saying, "Don't tell my mother
you saw m Jhere!'
"Wher *; ye left me I saw her give
money to.: Stout to bet for her. That
is the way iemoralization spreads from
the race fcra.sk. "
Supervisor Aigeltinger has a story of
the wrecking of a home caused by the
track. A man and wife had $3400 in
bank and intended to build a home for
themselves. The husband had reason
to look at the bankhook. which was
jointly in his name and that of his wife.
To his horror he found every dollar had

been drawn upon the signature of his
wife. When taxed with it she could
only say '-Ingleside." The husband
took his wife's duplicity so much to
heart that he separated from her, their
home being wrecked.
At the conclusion of the meeting of
the board each Supervisor was asked
to express his opinion of the resolution
which had been adopted. The inter
views that follow illustrate what the
Supervisors think of the evil they in
tend to suppress in San Francisco:
Supervisor Deasy â I believe on
general principles that horse racing
should be regulated. The town has
gone mad on the sport, and the time
has come when a halt should be
called. Horse racing is all right, but
it should be restricted and not al
lowed to assume the proportions it
has assumed here. The time has ar
rived when a check should be put to
both it and the coursing. It is dis
graceful the way women visit the
tracks and parks and bet openly.
Supervisor Perrault â In addition
to the corrupting influences of the
race track on our social life, it is
even worse on business. It diverts
money from the proper sources and
gives nothing in return. It is time
a check was placed on these bunko
steerers who have fleeced the public
so long and so fearlessly.
Supervisor Heyer â Horse racing
has gone beyond all reasonable
bounds, and, in justice to the people
of this city, should be restricted.
Thieves and vagabonds come here
from the East to rob our people. It
is getting worse and worse each year,
: and a stop must be put to it some
, time.
Supervisor Byington â The resolu-
Of This City From the
tion is a sweeping one, but some such
legislation is required to regulate the
sport. I know of the evils that have
developed at Ingleside, and it is the
duty of the board to end them.
Supervisor Aigeltinger â I am in
favor of placing such restrictions on
racing as will make it a legitimate
business proposition. If conducted
properly much of the evil could be
eliminated from the sport.
Supervisor Holland â I favor all
sports, provided they are carried on
in a proper manner. There should be
a check placed on it when it gets to
an extreme. When it degenerates
into gambling it should be stopped.
Supervisor Collins â I have not
given the resolution my undivided
attention as yet. From a cursory view
of it, however, - am impressed with
its significance. Horse racing and its
accompanying evils have certainly

worked disaster to the young and old
of our city. I have never in my life
seen v horse race. My impressions
have simply been formed by the
many sad cases resulting directly
from the betting ring that are daily
published in the newspapers. At the
present time I can hardly say that I
am in favor of total restriction of
gambling on horse racing. The rac
ing season should be limited. That
would remedy the evil.
Supervisor Phelps â At the present

time I cannot say anything in regard
to my position on this resolution. I
have friends on "both sides.
Supervisor Black â Dr. Perrault's
resolution is too far-reaching. I am
in favor of restricting the privileges
of the rare track people, but I am not
in favor of total restriction of gam
bling on horse races.
Bwperriflox Kalben â I do not care
to state my position.
Supervisor Byington â I am in fa- I
vor of restricting gambling on the
nee tracks altogether. It works a
great harm to the morals of our city.
I sincerely trust that this resolution
will be passed by the board, but I .
have small hopes that it will be. The
race trpck people have plenty of capi
tal to back up their schemes, and I
fear that they will use it in this case.
Supervisor Attridge â I am heart
ily in favor of Supervisor Perrault's
resolution to put a 'stop to gambling
on the race track. I coincide in all
the views expressed in the resolu
tion.

PRICE FIVE CEINTS.
NEW YORK, March 6.â The Herald'a
Washington correspondent sends the
i following: In making her demand on
China for the cession of territory and
I sphere of influence surrounding it, Italy
| has the support of France, Germany
| and Russia and the diplomatic opposi
tion of the United States and Great
Britain. I learned to-day from a high
diplomatic authority that before mak
ing her demand Italy sounded all the
, powers of Europe and then submitted
i a note to this government detailing her
i purpose and asking what action would
| be taken by it in case her plans were
I put into execution. The reply of Sec
retary Hay, formulated after careful
consultation with the President, depre
cated the proposed course of Italy, and
was in the nature of an objection to its
adoption. But Italy has taken no heed
to the wishes of the United States,
though she was careful to ask before
hand how far this government would
go in opposing her pretentions. Infor
mation in possession of the authorities
confirms the press reports of the land
ing of Italian marines at San Mun Bay,
despite the refusal of the Tsung Li Ya
men to comply with the demand.
In refusing the Italian demand the
Chinese Government is supported by
Great Britain, notwithstanding the re
ports to the contrary which have been
published, and the British Government
would like the United States and Ja
pan to join with it in strongly protest
ing against this invasion of Chinese
territory, even to the point of making
a display of force and engaging in hos
tilities to compel Italy to withdraw.
But the administration has no inten
tion of engaging in a European war, or
of making entangling alliances. Of
course, it has under serious considera
tion the policy it shall adopt. As told
to me to-day, there are two courses
that can be pursued. One is to make a
diplomatic representation to Italy de
claring that her acquisition of Chinese
territory and of "sphere of influence"
surrounding that territory is injurious
to trade interests of the United States,
and that this Government would be in
clined to see abandonment of her pre
tensions. The second contemplates the
submission of a remonstrance and then
protest against such acquisition, and
preparation to hack up such protect
with a display of force, and if neces
sary to engage in war.
It is needless to say that the admin
istration, while appreciating the inter
ests involved, will not adopt the second
course, certainly not at this time. Min
ister Conger at Peking, under instruc
tions from Washington, is sharply
watching developments in the situation
and keeping this Government informed,
but so far as I have been able to learn
he has made no direct representation to
the Chinese Government against the
granting of the Italian demand, though
the Peking authorities undoubtedly un
derstand the attitude of the United
States.
WASHINGTON, March 6.â There is a
mass of information on hand in both
the Navy and State Departments rela
tive to the encroachment of foreign
powers on the Chinese coast, but it is
in such shape that a concise statement
of the situation is difficult to obtain.
The fact is, however, that the oceupa-
Uon ef available ports along the coast
has gone to such lengths that the ma
jority of the desirable harbors, both in
value as roadsteads and for communi
cation with the interior, are in the
hands of foreign governments.
With England in possession of "Wel-
Hai-Wei, the Russians at Port Arthur,
the French at Anam and Tonquin, the
Germans holding Kiaochau, and with
the additional ports of Hongkong and
Singapore in the hands of the English
there is but little left in the way of de
sirable ports on the Chinese coast.
Shanghai is nominally in control of the
Chinese Government, but really is con

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 6.â The decree "Burns
or no Senator" has been issued from the J
yellow building in San Francisco. There
are many strong indications to-night
which lead to the belief that the manly
and independent Republicans of the
Legislature â will take affairs in their j
own hands and elect a United States
Senator despite the orders of Hunting
ton and Herrin to the contrary. Burns
cannot win the light now and it is very
doubtful if he can prevent the choice
of a Senator.
An anti-railroad sentiment in the
minds of the people of the State is find-
Ing expression in the Legislature. Last
fall the people believed that the rail
road was out of politics. Every Repub
lican orator and every Republican
newspaper that advocated the election
of Henry T. Gage and a Republican
Legislature assured the voters that the
railroad question was not an issue in
the campaign, but no sooner had the
votes been counted than webfoot Her
rin appeared on the streets of San
Francisco boasting of the scales he had
taken. He was intoxicated by the suc
cess of the campaign and saw in it no
other sign than one of triumph and per
sonal vindication.
The people accepted as truth the oft
repeated declaration of Huntington
that he wanted to establish good feeling
between the people of California and
the railway interests which his cor
poration controlled. The sand-lot ele
ment was snowed under, but immedi
ately after the result was made known
a scheme was hatched in the yellow
building to steal the Senatorship from
the people and give it to a servant of
the corporation. Men who were friend
ly to railroad enterprises on principle,
believing in railroad extension to de
velop the State, were counted as chat
tels of the Southern Pacific, who would
take orders when Herrin decided to is
sue mandates. The chief lawyer of the
corporation made a mistake. He mis
understood an honest desire to bring
about a friendly relation between the
railroad and the public as a desire upon
the part of legislators to enter the po
litical service of the road.
The threat that there shall be no can
didate elected other than Burns must
mean that the corporation wants to re
open the old right between the people
of California and the Southern Pacific
Railroad. All the good work of the
past in the direction of establishing
amicable relations between the people
and the railroad is to be thrown to the
winds by the company because the Leg
islature refuses to obey the commands
of th*2 corporation to elect Dan Burns.
Grove L. Johnson has been inter
viewed twenty times concerning the
statement he made last week that a
Senator would be elected next Wednes
day. He made the assertion with an air
of sincerity that induced many of his
friends to inquire what reason he had
for making the prediction. When
pressed into a corner for an explana
tion he replied that the whole thing
was a joke and that he had nothing in
his mind on which to base the predic
tion. As Johnson seemed to be thor
oughly in earnest when he made an as
sertion which he now admits was Jocu
lar, the impression naturally arises
that he was joking when he shed so
many bitter tears in the Assembly not
long since. â â¢â >..â¢ ...
-The betting in the pools to-night is
2 to 1. that no Senator will be elected.
Developments late to-}nght which will
re*ach the poolrooms before next
Wednesday may change the figures, if
not reverse them.
The indications point to further ac
cessions to the camp of General
Barnes. A report was telegraphed to
San Francisco to-day, that * General
Barnes' withdrawal from the Senatorial
contest was rumored in Sacramento.
No sooner had it reached there than
Senator Morehouee was apprised., by
wire of its reception, and . immediately
steps were taken to ascertain the
source from which the falsehood ema
nated. The information was secured
and the report promptly contradicted.
Senator Currier, who obtained leave
of absence two weeks since on account
of sickness and went to his home near
Los 'Angeles to regain health and
strength, will probably be in his seat
In the Senate to-morrow. He was one
of the original supporters of Bulla, and
II is the general opinion to-night that
he will vote for General Barnes when
he next answers to the call of the roll
in joint ballot for Senator.
Important telegrams have been re
ceived by Senator Boyce and Assem
blyman Merritt, representing the Santa
â¢ Barbara constituency in the Legisla
ture. Following is a copy of the mes
sage received by Senator Boyce from
the chairman and secretary of the Re
publican County Central Committee of
Santa Barbara County:
SANTA BARBARA, March 3, ISM.
J. J. Boyce, Senate, Sacramentoâ lf
Grant forces can be lined up for Barnes
without aiding Burns it will be generally
approved here E. M. PYLE, Chairman.
I. W. SMITH, Secretary.
A message of a similar character was
received by Assemblyman Merritt.
Boyce in an interview to-night de
clined to express an opinion as to what
course he should pursue with reference
to the message. He spoke of General
Barnes in complimentary terms, but did
not indicate a purpose to transfer his
allegiance from the San Diego states
man to the general. He remarked that
the telegram might be accepted as an
Indication of the trend of events in
Santa Barbara.
Senator Smith of Kern, one -of the
most intelligent and active representa
tives of the people in the Legislature, is
confident that a Republican Senator
will be elected at this session. To-night,
giving reasons, for his belief, he re
marked: "There is such good feeling
.â¢â rfuMnr i>--tÂ« - O*Â»Â«er*Â»l Barne*. U. B.
Grant and Irving M. Scott and their
I w.c supporters thai iney can get,
together at any time and exchange
vÂ°*ws Of the Senatorial question. The
friendly relations are -such that the
Barnes men and the Scott men can talk
together in a frank and free manner.
The Grant people are on good terms
with tho Barnes and Scott supporters.
I There is no doubt In my mind that be
fore the session ends these members
will endeavor to unite on one of these
three candidates, and if an agreement
cannot be reached a new candidate will
be brought out on whom all the forces
j can unite."
In the general conversation to-night
Senator Smith had nothing to say det
rimental to the aspirations of Burns
further than to signify that the conclu
sion had been accepted by the support
ers <>f Grant, Barnes and Scott that
Burns' election to the Senatorship was
not desired by the people of the State,
and therefore should not be accom
plished.
Irving M. Scott, who has been laid up
with grip for several days, will proba
bly arrive here from San Francisco to
morrow.
It transpires late to-night that the
Burns touts are seeking t)y intrigue
with Democratic legislators to bring
about adjournment of the Legislature
Saturday of this week. The offer was
made to the Democrats that If they
would consent to the early adjournment
the bills to reorganize the Harbor
Commission and the Bank Commission
would be defeated. The purpose of the
proposed early adjournment is to arouse
a demand for an extra session, and
pending the assembly of the Legisla
ture in special session the Burns man
agers would be able to lay wires and
devise plans to capture a sufficient
number of legislators to either elect
Burns or some other candidate accept
able to the railroad company and the
machine.
The Republicans in the Legislature
who came here to perform their duty
to the people were quick to drop on to
the Burns scheme to adjourn. To-day
a conference of Republican Senators
was held, and it was practically re
solved to adjourn Saturday, March 18.
This arrangement will give the Senate
ample time to consider the general ap
propriation bill and permit the Assem
bly to give the county government bill
such consideration as it deserves. The
Legislature will also have time to con
sider the tax levy and the constitu
tional amendments relating to the
Court of Appeals.
The Call is in possession of definite
information which justifies the state
ment that the Legislature will adjourn
Saturday March IS.

MENTO, March 6.â Senator Stratton's
bill for the appointment of a commission
to investigate voting machines and make
such recommendations as may lead to the
adoption of some such form of election
device received a setback in the Senate
this morning. It failed of passage by a
vote of 16 ayes to 12 noes. It- will come
up again, however, for Stratton changed
his vote from aye to no and gave noiice
of a motion* to reconsider.
Senator Curtin, under suspension of the
rules, submitted a concurrent resolution
asking the Federal Government to throw
open to the starving herds of cattle the
immense forest preserves along the Sier
ras. Senator. Curtin stated that the
tracts were closed to protect the forests,
but in so closing them they were closed
to cattle also. He believed that under
exciting circumstances the herds of cattle
now suffering from the effects of the dry I
season should be allowed Â«to- graze in these
forests. His resolution was adopted. v
A message was received from the Gov
ernor announcing the signing of Senator
Trout's bill providing for the acceptance
of a tract of land near Santa Cruz, to be
used as a camping ground for the Na
tional Guard of the State. Another bill
amending the Political Code so as to al
low the Governor to order the troops to
the tract for the annual camp of instruc
tion was passed by the Senate.
The Senate to-day passed the following
bills:
Senate bill 363, introduced by Trout,
amending section 2022 of the Political
Code.
Senate bill 515, Introduced by Taylor,
providing for the organization and man
agement of livestock insurance cam

A substitute was introduced in the Sen
ate to-day' for a proposed amendment to
the- constitution creating District Courts
of Appeal. The substitute, after being
amended, was adopted. It provides for
three District Courts of Appeal, of three

FENDER BILL GETS
A LITTLE SETBACK
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 6.â The ball was opened
in the Assembly this morning with Sena
tor Braunharfs "fender bill," which went
on the file on Saturday as unfinished
business.
O'Brien of San Francisco wished to of
for the amendment which he of
feied and withdrew for correction
when the bill was last consid
ered, but he was opposed by Dibble,
who claimed that the previous question
had been called for by him on Saturday
and ordered by the Speaker and that mo
previous question was upon the final pan
sage of the bill and an amendment of a
consequence was not in order.
White of San Francisco took issue with
Dibble on the parliamentary point. He
said he had sought advice on the question
since Saturday and had as well consulted
the highest authorities in the Legislature
and after much thought he was of the
opinion that the previous question was
on O'Brien's original motion to amend
and appoint a committee of one to at
tend to it. â â¢ . . .
Dibble indignantly asserted that he was
the highest authority in the State on
parliamentary law, and In the laugh
whicl' followed, which was led by the re
sounding chuckle of Assemblyman Hoey,
Dibble receded nicely from his position
by asking that the Speaker rescind the
order for the previous question and per
mit O'Brien to amend. O'Brien handel
up the amendment he proposed on Satur
day and the bill went back to the printer.
The little jar on the fender marked the
one dissension of the day. Wmtewingeii
peace settled all over everything and
Grovel and Dibble were altogether too
nice to be safe. Even the general appro
priation bill ran along smoothly enough,
save for a verbal rough-and-tumble be
tween Valentine and Dunlap over the ap
propriation for the support of the Stock
ton Insane Asylum. The work of the
day was on the Senate special, ways and
means, unfinished business and third
reading flies. All of Governor Gage's
vetoes on tile were sustained.

realized he said, that mothers who had

their children taken from them, but that
they were not looking to a child's best

said. It would open the treasury to in

Pierce of Yolo made an excellent speech
along the same lines and others on the

spoke conscientiously in its favor, but the

position.
NEWSPAPER SIGNATURE
BILL MOVING ALONG
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-
MENTO, March 6.â Another bill to re- !
strict the newspapers and to teach them
their business of publication of the newj
came before the Senate this evening, and
after amendment was passed to print and
third reading. The measure was the j
Morehouse bill to require the signature of j
those who write any articles which may |
reflect upon the character or integrity of
any living person or upon the memory of
any one dead. When the bill came up for
consideration Senator Morehouse offered ,
an amendment providing that when any
article was published as coming from any
news agency the requirement of a slgna- !
ture was not necessary.
Smith opposed the amendment, for, said
ho, it would exempt from the law the
Associated Press and such other news
corporations, while it laid all the burden
upon the struggling individual who had
a little country correspondence to attend
to and who could not stand the penalty
of $1000 which the act allows. He said
there is no more powerful or more grind- |
ing corporation than the Associated Press
and he did not want to see it escape the
burden which the bill put on the individ- ;
ual writer.
Morehouse pointed out that the Asso
dated Press dealt with news from other
States and was therefore out of the jur
isdiction of any act of this Legislature,
but Smith was not satisfied, and voted
against the amendment. The amendment
was passed, however,. and the bill went to i
print and to third reading.
A VETO FOR THE
DAIRY INSPECTION
Governor Gage Picks Many
Flaws in Senator Dick*
inson's Measure.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- j
MENTO, March 6.â The Governor has ye- j
toed Senator Dickinson's bill providing j
for a bureau of dairy inspection, and in a
long message picks flaws in nearly all the
provisions of the measure.
The bill provides that no dairy products
nor beef shall be sold from a herd af
fected with Texas or splenetic fever. In |
his veto message the Governor "declares
that this works a great hardship on herd
owners in the southern portion of the i
State. In discussing the disease he says
the southern cattle are not susceptible to
the ravages of the fever. They may be
infected and may even be capable of
transmitting* the disease to other cattle,
but it hurts neither their milk nor their
flesh; and to prohibit the sale of their
products would work a hardship, unjust
and unnecessary, upon them.
Again the Governor objects to that pro
vision which prohibits the sale of prod
ucts from cattle affected with contagious
pleuro-pneumonia. The Governor says
there is no pleuro-pneumonia in the
State, and to have it included in the bill
is a tacit admission that it does act
ually exist here. He believes this im
pression would do much harm to the
market for California cattle abroad, and
he did not want to approve the bill bo
long as it Included such a provision.
The Governor further objects to the lat
itude allowed tin bureau provided for by
the hill in the appointment of agent! ami
veterinary surgeons. The bureau is al
lowed twenty agents ;it $4 h day and Bye
veterinary surgeons at $S ;i day. This
expense of $120 a day, the Governor de
clares, Is exorbitant and will soon rat up
the funds allowed the bureau. Another
objection which the Governor finds to the
bill is that while it is provided that thf>
bureau should be formed of practical
dairymen, the work it is desired it should
perform is properly the work of medical
experts.
Tn conclusion, the Governor recom
mends that another bill be drawn on the
same subject, as it is one of great impor
tance. Jn pursuance of this suggestion.
Senator Dickinson is preparing another
bill in accordance with the suggestions of
the Governor, amending the references to
the diseases the Governor mentioned, ami
placing the matter of prevention and
remedying in the hands of the State quar
antine system provided for In a bill al
ready passed by the Senate.
The rules were suspended and the veto
w;is sustained by the Senate in ord- r to
clear the way for the Introduction of the
substitute bill now under preparation.
THE RAILROAD
CONSOLIDATION
BILL FAVORED
Caminetti Made a Strong but
Ineffectual Fight Against
the Measure.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, March 6.â The Judiciary Com
mittee of the Assembly held a special
meeting at 1:30 o'clock this afternoon to
consider Senate bill 27. a substitute for a
bill by Valentine of Los Angeles.
The bill is designed to permit the Santa
Fe system to utilize the franchises of the
Santa Fe and Pacific Railroad Company
between Mojave and The Needles, the
Southern Pacific between Mojave and Ba
kersfleld. the San Joariuin Valley Railroad
Company between Bakersfteld and San
Francisco and the Southern California
Railway between Los Angeles and Bars
tow.
The use of all of these lines the Santa
Fe people require that they may get their
transcontinental line into San Francisco
In competiton with the lines of the Cen
tral and Southern Pacific roads.
The meeting to-day was anything but a
quiet talk. Only after the warmest argu
ment, both in open and executive session,
was the committee permitted to bring in
a recommendation that the bill pass.
Caminetti of Amador was the sole oppo
nent to the measure and he based his tight
on the idea that the bill would permit the
Southern Pacific to get control of the
Santa Fe's proposed extension.
Colonel E. F. Preston of San Francisco
appeared as representative for the Santa
Fe and San Joaquin Valley people. In
speaking: to the measure he called atten
tion to the incalculable relief which the
Santa Fe would bring to the shippers of
the State by bringing in a competing line.
He spoke of the money that would be put
in circulation by the purchase and subse
quent maintenance of the branch roads
and their ramifieatoins. It will bring into
the State, he said, new blood and new
capital.
"The present law," said Colonel' Pres
ton, "permits the consolidation of State
franchises, but the Santa Fe and Pacific,
between Moiave and The Needles, is op
erating under a Federal franchise and
over that this State has no jurisdiction
under present conditions It is to enable
the Santa Fe people to make use of this
franchise and to consolidate as a system
of its own the rights and privileges it
proposes to buy."
Mr. Caminetti broke in on Mr. Preston
at this point to ask if the State Board of
Railroad Commissioners would not lose its
right to revise or repeal the franchises in
question if they were transferred under
the provisions of the proposed law.

GRANT MEN WILL
STAND BY THEIR MAN
TALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRAMENTO. March 2.â The support
ers of Grant dined with their leader this evening and over the wine and
the viands discussed the situation in an informal but an earnc' man
ner. There were speeches and toasts and jokes and stories, but under it
all there was an undercurrent of something that told of another reason
fur the gathering than to discuss the excellent menu, to drink the wine
and add zest to the good cheer and joviaity.
There was little said of politics, but what was said was right to thÂ°
point, and it was to the effect that as long r.s Grant ran see a chance
for the United States Senate so long will his men stand by him. In
standing by him it was declared by" one of the speakers they had at
Ipast saved the State from the disgrace and opprobrium that would
result from th~ election of Burns, even if their own candidate had not
yet reached the goal of his ambition.
Senator Smith spoke first of the enthusiasm of his campaign com.
rades and exhorted them to stand together as long as there was a chance.
Chynoweth and Boyce followed him in much the same strain, anc". then
Le Barmn added his word. He hoped the Legislature would n t ad
journ without electing a Senator, and he was sure if ar.v one secured thÂ«
prize it would be Grant. He encouraged his fellow campaigners tn
stand together until the last and then, if they found they could not elect,
to go over in a solid block to some, one â not Burns â who would be as
fair and capable a representative as the man they now follow.
Grant himself spoke briefly and his words were mostly those of
gratitude and appreciation. He thanked his men heartily, he said, the
more so because they were bound to him by no tie they had not woven
themselves: they were obligated to him only by their generous sense
of loyalty and good will.
Five of the Grant mÂ«n were absent, but all for good reasons. They
were Maggard, Works, Dale, De Lancle and Greenwell.
The banquet commenced at 6, and when the House tried to convene
at T there was no quorum. Sergeants at arms hurried around to hunt up
the recalcitrants and finally found them In a body headed for th^ Capi
tol. At tlje bar of the House the occasion was taken into consideration
and the banqueters were excused from the penalty of unlicensed ab
sence.
"The moment you transfer franchises to
foreign corporations you eliminate the
right of California to revise or repeal
them." said Mr Oaminetti. positively.
"You do not." replied Colonel Preston,
just as positively.
"Colonel Preston, I am going to ask you
a question in good faith." continued the
gentleman from Amador. "Will you an
swer it in Rood faith? Will -lot this bill
permit the Southern Pacific to buy up and
control all these lines?"
Preston replied emphatically that it
would not. ,
"Then." shouted Caminetti, "you do not
answer me in good faith. I air willing to
give the Santa Fe everything it needs,
but not one thing to the 'S. P.
Then Messrs. Dibble ana Johnson
choked Caminetti off with a demand that
the committee go into executive session
It was so ordered, after Caminetti had
made a hard fight to ask more questions,
and after it was over the committee came
into the Assembly chamber and recom
mended that the bill pass.
SANTA CLARANS
GREATLY STIRRED
UP OVER A BILL
The County Government Meas
ure Roundly Denounced
by Taxpayers.
SAN JOSE. March 6.â Residents of this
city and county are almost unanimously
opposed to the now county government
act now pending before the Senate : It
means an increase of from $40,000 to $50,000
annually in the expenses of the county.-
Several offices are created and the peo
ple's money generally ruthlessly expend
ed. Strong resolutions condemning it as
a vicious measure have been passed by
the Santa Clara County Grange, the Re
publican Good Government League and
the Farmers' Club, and forwarded to the
Santa Clara delegation at Sacramento.
Never before has any legislation for the
county aroused such ill feeling, and Sen
ator Morehouse, who Is responsible for it,
is being severely denounced.
Supervisor John Rollâ The new county
government act is the greatest steal ever
perpetrated upon the county. I am against
it from start to finish. It will cost Santa
Clara County nearly $50,000 pe,r year, and
people will be in no way benefited. It
provides for a license collector, a prose
cuting attorney in Justice courts and an
additional under Sheriff, besides putting
Justices of the Peace and Constables on
good, fat salaries with all office expenses.
It is unjust to expend the people' 3 money
in this way. The cost of conducting the
county is already too high.
Supervisor S. F. Ayerâ The new county
government act will make our expenses
too high and I do not favor any legisla
tion that will cinch taxpayers.
Supervisor F. M. Sternâ Some parts of
it are all right, but as a whole I am
against it. I do not favor the wholesale
increase of county expenses.
County Clerk H. A. Pfister-The pro
nosed change in the county government
act will benefit us in no way. It only tends
I to increase taxation, with no correspond-
I injr benefit.
A Alloggiâ It is an unjust measure.
! whose only object is to increase the ex
penses of an already too expensive coun
ty government.
Supervisor P. P. Austin-I am opposed
' to the measure as a whole, except that
i part which allows Supervisors to name
1 Supervisor G. E. Reaâ The proposed
county government act in its entirety is
yi 'C. Andrewsâ We want no such
measure. Higher taxation and more fat
positions will not benefit Santa Clara
County. Our Senators should see that it
is defeated.
Ex-Councilman T. C. Hoganâ The pro
posed new county government act will
work hardship upon taxpayers. Our taxes
are already too high. Every effort should
i be made to defeat it.
Mitchell Phillipsâ Such robbery as pro
posed by the county government act
should not be tolerated by Santa Clarans.
We have too many worthless offices now,
let alone creating more fat sits for gang
politicians. The adding of $40,000 to a
I yearly expense of running the county will
i be detrimental to our interests. Too much
Fower is centralized in the Supervisors,
am opposed to the measure.
Judge J. R. Lewisâ The present county
government act is bRd enough. Now th^y
propose to cinch us for some $40,000 more
each year. All the corrupt politicians of
the county have been to Sacramento "log
rolling in the interest of the act. which
will give fat positions to Johnnie Mac
kenzie and others of his ilk. Legislator*
who vote for the measure should be sent
to San Quentin.
Mayor J. C. Martinâ Anything that in
creases taxation ought to be defeated and
I am against the county government act.
M. O'Brienâ We want no such legisla
tion for our county.
J. 11. Henryâ The county government
act should be defeated by all means.
T. C. MacChesney â Our Senators and
Assemblymen must "see that it is defeat
ed if they wish the respect of their con
stituents.
Nicholas Bowdenâ l am opposed to any
such measure.
Lawrence Archerâ The people should
use every effort to have the measure
killed in the Senate or Governor Gage
veto U.
E. McLaughlinâ The county government
act is designed to benefit politicians and
I am satisfied nearly every taxpayer in
the county is arrayed against it.
D. M. Burnettâ No such legislation aa
that for me.
MERCHANTS AFRAID OF
AN OBSCURE CLAUSE
Several of the measures now pending
before the Legislature contain clausge re
ferring to railroad corporations and
transportation companies operating lines
in the Stateâ lnnocent clauses apparently,
but in several instances so constructed as
to be capable of various interpretations.
One of these measures in particular, a
bill introduced in the Senate by Senator
Braunhart, contains a provision that in
the case of a railroad corporation pur
chasing the property of another corpora
tion of a similar character the rates in
effect on the lines of the purchased road
shall not be Changed. It is whispered
that this is an attempt to take the con
trol of all the railroads in the State out
of the hands of the State authorities, in
asmuch as legislation cannot be made to
apply to one road alone. The bill is sup
posed to refer to the purchase of the Val
ley road by the Santa Fe. and it is ar
gued that if the Railroad Commissioners
are shorn of authority to regulate the
rates of that road th?ir authority to reg
ulate rates on all other lines will cease
at the same time. The matter was called
to the attention of the Merchants' Asso
ciation yesterday afternoon, and whilp
there was no direct evidence that such
was the intent of Braunhart's bill it was
deemed the part of wisdom to take pre
cautions to prevent the passage of any
measure which might conflict with the
interests of the people of the State. Ac
cordingly, the following telegram was dis
patched' to the chairmen of the Senate
and Assembly Judiciary Committees and
to certain members of the Legislature:
"The Merchants' Association of San
Francisco opposes any legislation which
relinquishes the control of the State of
California over the franchises, properties
and lines of railroads now built or Which
may hereafter be constructed in this
State or which waives the right of the
State to control and regulate their bonded
indebtedness and passenger and freight
rates, and urges that such reservations
shall be specifically inserted in every
SUCh ASSOCIATION."

ernment bill of the last Legislature has
been in effect only since the Ist of last
January is the most serious obstacle In
the progress of the one brought up at this
Fes=sipn. It Is claimed the one now in
force Is good enough: that the one under
consideration will take weeks of time in
Its consideration ami that as events so
far seem to indicate there Is a strong dis
position to so amend the present measure
vs 1 to make it Identical with the one of
. two' years ago.
In the Assembly the leaders in the oppo
sition are .'â¢.::;â¢ rich. Blood and Caminetti,
Lacked by the San Francisco delegation.
They declare that if the bill is rereferred
to the committee it will, never leave there
r.gain this session, and Meltck. the chair
man of that committee, is reported to
have agreed that it should be so.
In the Senate it is not expected the bill
will be defeated, but it is certain if it
ever should get through it will be amend
ed so It would hardly know Itself. There
have been two important amendments
passed upon so far in the Senate, and
both have been reamended'to bring the
bill back to where it started from by the
la^t of two years ago. Senator Curtln has
announced that he will withdraw all the
amendments he has proposed for the
benefit of Tuulumne County, and the Ala
meda delegates, or some of them, have
shown a decided intention to spit some of
. the clauses relating to Alameda upon
' : their disapproval. There are other Sen
ators, too, who think the measure at this
/etage of the session would be a waste of
time, and among them all It is liable to
fare badly.
The lawyers are the most complicated in
their opposition. Senator Curtin explains
that he is going- to withdraw his amend
ments for tear of jeopardizing the sal
aries of the present officers of his county
In a vain endeavor to benefit them. Under
the-cor.stitutlon no act can be passed rais
ing the salary of any one in office at the
time the act is passed, so it is plain, even
If the sent act could be amended to
give Tuolumne that increase in salaries
â¢which every one on the floor is willing to
concede is her due, still the raise could not
.be applied until two years from now and
then the text census will have been com
pleted and Tuolumn* will have been pro-
jnoted to another class, for her population
warants it even now, and then there will
be a new -salary schedule to apply in her
case. To put in any amendment that tends
to raise salaries. Senator Curtin reasons,
â¢would only lay present salaries under a
clnud.
Most of the important amendments are
on this subject of salaries, and the rea
sons advanced for withdrawing the
amendments for Tuolumne apply In other
cas.es and most of them, too, will be with
drawn. ' ; ' .' â  .
The committee has done a great deal of
â work on the bill and has proceeded in a
manner calculated to satisfy every one.
In th* committee meetings every amend
ment affecting any one county and sub
mitted by. that county's proper represent
ative was put into this bill without ques
tion and only those amendments affecting
the general" provisions of the measure
were discussed by the committeemen. As
a consequence the bill, so far as it relates
ta the individual counties, has been made
â Jf, practically by the county itself, but a
combination of circumstances is agnlnst
it and it will pass only by good fortune.
Senator Storehouse, chairman of the
Bcriate Committee on County Government,
and chairman of the joint sessions of the
Senate and Assembly committees, has
}K-ard nothing definite of any intention to
kill the bill "I would be sorry to see it
killed." he said, "for we have spent a
Krt-at iical of work upon It- We have
given every one a chance to see that his
c'ountv was dealt with fairly, and I see no
reason why the bill should not go through.
But if they want to kill it I suppose they
. can.*'
PROGRESS MADE WITH
THE APPROPRIATION BILL
CAM. HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MEXTO. March 6.â The general appro
priation bill came up In the Assembly
: again to-day and considerable progress
â¢was made with it before adjournment
v:is taken.
The principal contention arose over the
amount allowed for the support of the
Stockton Insane Asylum. As the bill was
drafted by the "Ways and Means Com
mittee It allowed the -asylum $203,000â
JCXX) less than the appropriation of two
3 c.irs ago. Dunlap of Stockton moved
to lend by making the allowance $213,
--000, but Valentine, chairman of the com
mittee, opposed him Vigorously. John-
Fen 'of Sacramento backed Dunlap, and
"they both contended that the asylum
â¢would need more money because of the
liigher price of staples and the estimated
â¢ increase' sn the number of inmates. Val
entine pulled figures on" them to proVe
that the number of Inmates was less on
January I of this year than on the same
dat" in 1598. Caminelti supported him
â¢ v.-itli the statement that fully $10,000 la
row realized by the asylum every two
years from the care of private patients,
and this amount, he said, had not been
figured when the committee, made its
â¢ estimate?. - ,' . /"â 
'- When the amendment came to a vote
it was knocked out by but two or three
votes All of the appropriations for the
. Commissioner of Public Works were
stricken from the bill, as there is now a
' .measure on the files which does away
with the office. i â '.-â -'.:.'
The appropriations killed are the Com
missioner's salary for twenty months,
$M 00: salary of secretary, 13000; printing;
""â  The salaries of the Code Commlssion
ers and their 'secretary were brought In
question by Johnson, but Caminetti, one
of the commission, explained that the
work in hand was not finished, but would
probably be within the coming two years.
The appropriations were allowed to
M The appropriation of $93,000 for the sala
ries of officers of the Southern California
Hospital for the Insane is $20,000 greater
than that of '97, and the fact was re
k marked by Johnson.
<* Valentine explained that the Institution
was greatly . overcrowded and .that the
number of inmates had- largely increased.
He was supported by Wade and Ather
ton who Inspected the institution. They
paid" that the place was so crowded that
a number of the inmates were compelled
to sleep In the basement. Johnson with
drew his objection and the Items ere al
lowed to stand.
For the salaries of the officers of the
TWkoley institution for the Deaf and
Dumb and the Blind $9500 is appropriated.
Mead of I,os Angeles offered an amend
ment providing that all perquisites re
ceived by the superintendent of the in
stitution be turned over to the State.
Speaking to the amendment he said he
understood the superintendent had not
only a fat salary, but made good money
by a system of perquisites which rightly
belonged to the State.
Ex-Speaker Wright attempted to reply,
but found he had not come prepared, and
gave way to Dibble.
Dibble explained that a bill was already
passed covering Mead's amendment, and
the Southerner withdrew.
The biH witt be given further considera
tion to-morrow afternoon.

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 6.â Dan Burns and his
racing associates in their efforts to se
cure for themselves a monopoly of
gambling privileges in San Francisco
have antagonized other gamblers and
now find themselves . opposed by a
strong delegation which is determined
to fight the proposition to prohibit bet
ting on horse races except within a
race track lnclosure.
There arrived in Sacramento to
night a delegation headed by Henry
Schwartz, Harry Corbett and others.
These men declare that Burns^ Joe
T'llman, Henry J. Crocker and Ed Cor
rigan are making an attempt to create
by legislative enactment a gambling
trust. In other words they are at
tempting to legalize their own cam-
Ming game and at the same time pre
vent others of their ilk from partici
pating In it.
Th>> fact is Bet forth that Corrigan
and t'llman have ruined racing in the
East and have by their methods closed
up every race track with which they
have been associated. They now pro
pose to come to California and secure
a gambling monopoly which will en
able them to rob the public to the total
exclusion of others who are more en
titled to such privileges than they. The
men who are here tv fight Burns and
Corrigan propose to get their share of
gambling privileges, if any are granted.
They will expose the methods of Burns,
Corrigan and Crocker and give the pub
llc the benefit of some inside history of
the racing game. _

CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, March 6.â Senate constitutional
amendments 1, 2. 12, 13 and IS were all
lumped together in one substitute by the
Senate to-day. They are amendments re
lating to changes in the system of jus
tice in this State and include several im
portant features.
The most pronounced innovation provid
ed for in the amendments is a Court of
Appeals, two tribunals of intermediate
jurisdiction between the present Superior
<v>urts and the Supreme Court. In the
substitute two of these courts were pro
vided for and it was further provided that
they should have but twenty cases under
consideration at thÂ»> same time. When
the substitute was adopted by the Senate
Senator Dickinson moved to amenri it by
adding a provision for a third appellate
court a.nd raising the number of cases
allowed to be under consideration at one
time to fifty. Tbj? amendment was added
to the substitute and the whole went to

THE SAN FRANCISCO CAIX, TUESDAY, MARCH 7, 1899.
MISS WALSH
IS AT LAST
VINDICATED
She Scores aTriumph
in "La Tosca."
OFFENBACH AT THE TIVOU
ALHAMBRA OPENS WITH PAT
RIOTIC MELODRAMA.
A New English Farce at the Alcazar.
Miss Waldorf in "The Hunch
back'* â New Vaude
ville.
Ttevenge is 3weet. I can see Blanche
Walsh reading the newspapers this
morning and enjoying a well-earned
gloat at our expense. Once upon a
time this same young woman appeared
here without signal success, andâ well,
you remember the sort of town she
called us. But now at last she is come
into her own ~nd the laugh is on" the
other side.
In "La Tosca," at the Columbia Thea
ter last night, she had a part to play,
and she played it as no other woman
has played it in English, and her
triumph in the presence of an audience
that was at first none too hopeful and
sympathetic was overwhelmingly com
plete. After the premature disclosure
of Janet Waldorf and the unskilled
genius of Nance O'Neil, Miss Walsh's
strenuous acting and disciplined tem
perament are doubly welcome. She is
not a question of the morrow, but a
good, glad fact of to-day. She is an
actress- to be reckoned with seriously.
To say she has fallen into the mantle
of the late Fanny Davenport would be
cheap praise. She acted Tosca last
night as Fanny Davenport never dared
to act it. She is indebted to Miss Dav
enport for the play, the "production,"
Melbourne Macdowell. and the oppor
tunity â that is all.
As far back as I can accurately re
member Fanny Davenport was a
plump, amiable person, who never
struck the real spark, but who was al
ways fairly reliable and who always
attended to it that her productions
were sumptuously and artistically
scened and furnished. Scenic sumptu
ousness was not conspicuous last night.
It was perhaps the same scenery, but
grown tired with the years. Mr. Mac
dowell was unchangedâ the same large,
industrious personality. The play was
the same old Sardou melodramaâbru
tal, shocking and obviously sensational
(but not, I may add, larded with ob
scene religious flubdub, a la "Sign of
the Cross"). But the woman, Floria
Tosca, was new, and she gripped you
at times almostâ l say it in modestyâ
as Bernhardt used to do.
The most notable quality 5n Miss
Walsh's impersonation was in its in
genuousness. Throughout the various
scenes of love, jealousy, terror, revul
sion and despair this ingenuousness
â was never wholly absent. Floria was
always a girl whose heart was love
and whose head was heart; she was
unaffected, unheroicâ even In the big
moment when she stabbed Scarpla the
keynote was simplicity, and I am glad
to mention that she did not end this
scene with the usual theatrical device
of placing candles at the dead man's
head.
It must .not be Inferred that Miss
Walsh's impersonation was in any
sense anaemic or overrepressed. It was
full of flesh and blood and gave prac
tically unlimited vent to vocal and
facial expression, but it was played
from the inside, so to say, without ap
parent theatricallsm and with the un
erring spell of sincerity. Miss Walsh
has not only the talent, the mimetic
gift, the human voice and the magnetic
personality, but she has the technique.
She is an artist. Blanche Walsh has
vindicated herself and the equine is
happily on us. So fall in line and do
the proper thing and there will not be
as much vacant upholstery in the Co
lumbia as there was last night.

THEIR DREAM OF
LOVE SHATTERED
DANIEL SHEA AND MAMIE MTL
LER ARE DISENCHANTED.
Became Acquainted Through a Matri

Are Now in the Game.
Mamie Miller of St. Louis. Mo., and
Daniel Shea, a member of the notorious
Shea family, better known as "scarred
face Dan." got acquainted through a mat
rimonial paper and started a eorrespopd
ence. Dan represented in his letters that
he was a wealthy dealer in horses and
had a pleasant home, was handsome and
domestic in his habits; while Mamie
wrote him that she was an heiress, of
handsome presence and engaging man
ners.
Finally Dan wrote her on January 16
to come" to this city and they could get
married and settle down. She arrived
here a few days later, and when they
met each nearly had a fit. Mamie is far
from prepossessing, and her whole for
tune consisted of $20 which she brought
with her. Dan's face is badly scarred
from the effects of vitriol which his now
deceased wife in a fit of jealousy threw
on it. Mamie's love dream waa soon dis
pelled.
Yesterday MJss Miller swore to a com
plaint in Judge Graham's court, charging
Dan with betrayal under promise of mar
riage as they had agreed notwithstand
ing their disenchantment to get mar
ried; but Dan now refuses to carry out
his part of the agreement, although he
borrowed $10 from her.

of employment have only resulted in
naught. The landlord threatens to eject

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
HAVANA. March 6.â For the month
of March the various provinces, except
ing the province of Santiago, have
made requisition for two million ra
tions. Thus, instead of diminishing, the
requisition has doubled since that of
January 1. This is due partly to the
fact that the Cubans use every possi
ble opportunity to get rations under
false pretenses, and partly to the fact
that the American distributors are un
able to discriminate properly between
impostors and the really needy. The
requisition for the province of Havana
for March is 650,000 rations. Major
General Ludlow has given the strictest
order that the distributors in Havana
sha.ll, as far as possible, give only to
persons really 111, utterly unable to
work, or of advanced age, and that ap
plicants who are proved guilty of mis
representing their condition shall be se
verely punished.
The supply ship Comal, with a million
rations, will proceed to Matanzas and
Keuvitas to unload to-morrow.
The Cuban military assembly held a
third secret session this afternoon, a
guard being placed around the house
whore the meeting was held and the

fathered by Senor Farres is still under
discussion.
General Maximo Gomez ignores the
assembly. With the disarming of the

solution.

canteen against his expressed wish, and
was threatened with imprisonment if he
declined to obey orders.
The statement was reiterated to Dr.
Urmy after the meeting, and the latter
told his fellow-pastors at the next meet
ing of the Methodist Ministers' Union the
facts as he knew them. A committee,
consisting of the reverend gentleman, Dr..
Wilson and Dr. Beard, was appointed to
investigate the matter. Dr. Urmy
wrote a letter to General Shafter, stating
the facts, and in answer received the fol
lowing letter, which was read at the
weekly meeting yesterday:
â¢ Headauarters Department of California,
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 2S. 1599.
Rev. W. S Urmy. Pastor First M. E. Church,
.Â«un Franciscoâ Dear Sir: Referring to your let
ter of recent date enclosing statement of com
mittee with reference to tlie service of Private
B F. Joslin in the "canteen" at Alcatraz
Inland I have to say I immr-iliat.ly sent one
of my staff to investigate the case, cautioning
him to do so In such a manner as not to give
rise to a belief that I'rivat.- Joslin had made
any complaint. Private Joslin on being ques
tioned stated that he had no objection what
ever to working in the "canteen" or handling
or *- -lling beer. That he had not and did not
oMect to being detailed for the duty. He was"
informed that as the duty was not strictly in
thÂ« line of what might be termed military
duty he had a perfect right to object to per
forrr.'ing the duties. That as he was paid ex
tn for the service by the "â¢canteen" manage
ment the service was voluntary on his part,
nml that he would not be compelled to per
form the duties If he wished to avoid doing so.
He replied thnt he understood the situation,
but that he had no objection whatever to per
forming the duties.
Private Joslin was also questioned as to his
treatment while in the hospital. He said that
It was his opinion that the reason why he was
not given more to eat while In the hospital was
becauie the surgeon in charge wished him to
havp a light diet. That he had not applied to
friends for food, but that when they viÃlted
him they offered to nend things to him, and
that they did. He did not have to pay for what
* 'V hop" this will be satisfactory to you and
the other members of the committee". There
seems to have been some misapprehension or
misunderstanding between the man ami those
who a-e interested in him. He stated in the
course of the investigation that some person
In the city might object to his working In the
"canteen." but that he had no objection hlm
uf>u Very respectfully,
self. \ery r WIIyLIAM M SHAFTER,
Major General V. S. V . Commander.
JosUn was seen on Alcatraz Island yes
terday, and made the following state-
m "BÃ>ther Urmy was mistaken when he
saidl was given no food while in the hos
nltal It was furnished me. but was of
the poorest Quality. / I was detailed to
work in the canteen, and stayed there one
day but as the work was against my
religious principles I asked and was
riven permission by Lieutenant Haynes
to return to my company. I am sorry
this sot out. as it is_ likely to hurt me dur
ing my enlistment."

his wife and four small children near

nor, Gilbert confessed.
Gilbert said he was badly In debt, and
had been trying to leave Enterprise for
a long time. He could not take his
family, he said, and offered his wife a
divorce.
"She kept nagging at me about tho
children," said Gilbert. "I told my wife
if she would give me $10 I'd leave and
never bother her any more. During the
night I got up and went out into the
yard. Coming back I picked up a ham
mer and hit the baby on the head. My
wife ran out Into the road and was go-
Ing over to the neighbors. I ran after
her and caught her. She said she'd
come back if I'd behave, and I thought
I would then. But when we got inâ
why, the baby was thrashing about on
the bed and when I saw it I could not
hold myself, but hit my wife on the
head and pounded her until she could
not move and then took the children."
When asked why he did it, Gilbert
said:
"I don't know. It seemed like I just
couldn't help it. after seeing the baby
there on the bed."

BROKE UP THE SHOW.
Maids of a Chinatown Vaudeville
Company Didn't Get Their
Salaries.
The rightoous indignation of eleven fair j
damsels over the non-appearance of sal- |
aries ha? caused the dissolution of wie j
alleged vaudeville company -vyhich has
been giving performances in the Wash
ington-street Theater in Chinatown for
the last three weeks.
Sunday night was the time "Shorty" ;
Benjamin, the manager of the company,
had promised his st.-irf. their salaries. Kjt '
the ladies in the troop eleven had salaries !
ranging from $5 down to 50 cents due j
them. After the performance Sunday !
night all were called upon the stage and \
the manager suavely informed them that |
the gate receipts had not been up to his \
expectations, but that he would pay out L
pro rata ail the money he had taken in. |
The highest amount received by any one ;
was 50 cents and some of the fairies were 1
left without a cent.
Then the war cloud which had been
gathering while the explanations were
being made by the manager burst. "Only
nfta centa for my week worka?" shrieked '
one of the maidens, who was evidently
reared under Italy's sunny skies, and "I
only get 25 cents?" wailed Maud, who is
a native daughter. But Maud thought a
moment and an idea struck her. She
tbrww the naltrv two-bit nieea on the floor i
and, seizing a whip which was among the
properties, she informed her manager
thai if be didn't raise the sum to 50 cents
she would chastise him. Her assertion
that shy had horsewhipped a man before
and knnv how to do a good job influ
enced tho manager to grant her request.
The Successful outcome of Maud's at
tempt and the urging they received from
that lady to try tho same medicine in
clucfo the other maidens to threaten the
the roughly frightened Benjamin. He was
hustled, pulled ami pushed from one end
of the. stase to the oth.-r hy the enraged
women. Lynching, tar and feathers and
divers other punishments were suggested
and would possibly have been carried out
had nut the police, attracted by the noise,
arrived on the scene. With dffflculty Of
ficers Bonner and Butler of Lieutenant
Price's squad rescued Benjamin from his
sorry plight and piloted him safely out of
Chinatown.

LETTER WITHHELD
BY SCHLEY, NOT BY
SECRETARY LONG
Closing Statement in the Naval
Controversy to Complete
the Record.
WASHINGTON, March 6.â The Senate
committee on Naval Affairs to-day made
public Secretary Long's second letter in
the Sampson-Schley controversy, this
communication being in reply to Hear Ad
miral Schley's letter. The tlrst matter
â which the Secretary takes up is Admiral
Schley's mention 6f Admiral Sampson's
letter of May 20, which the Secretary says
seems to have given certain Senators the
impression the department has withheld
that letter. On this point he says:
Firstâ That thl6 letter was not in the
possession of the department on February
6, nor was its existence known to the
department at that time.
Secondâ That it was In the possession of
Admiral Schley until the 9th of February,
when it was s. n to the department, upon
Its request to be furnished with air official
record? relating to his duty as commander
In chief of the flying Bquadron and as a
ftag officer in the North American fleet.
Thirdâ ln its Instructions with regard
to maintaining the blockade of Clenfuegos
It wjis not more explicit than the letter of
Admiral Sampson of May 19, which accom
panied the communication of February t>.
itnd which is published in the appendix to
ihe report of the Bureau of Navigation
on p&ge 4ti4.
Fourthâ That on May 21. the day after
it was written. Admiral Sampson sent
orders to Commodore Schley in duplicate
by the Hawk and Ma.rWeh.ead. which or
ders were received by Commodore Schley
during the early forenoon of the 23d and
24th respectively, directing Commodore
Schley to proceed with all dispatcn, but
cautiously, to Bsintiag-o, if satisfied that
the Spanish squadron was not at Cien
fuegos. The orders as sent back ffy the
Hawk were receive. 1 on the same day as
the letter of the 20th, and bearing the
later date. May 21. of course revoked the
instructions to blockade . CienfuegoS
tamed in the letters of the 19th and 20th.
Fifthâ That in addition to thesa instruc
tions the flying squadron h ft Cienfuegos
on the afternoon of the 24th. but did not
reach the immediate vicinity of the port
of Santiago until the morning of the 29th
of May.
The Secretary quotes the admiral's
reference to the department's order re
ceived by him on May 27, directing him
to positively ascertain if Cervera's fleet
was in Santiago harbor and not to al
low him to leave Santiago if found cer
tainly to be there, "without a decisive
action," gives the admiral's reply in full
and gays:
It will be seen that Rear Admiral
Bchley's statement to the Senate does not
show that he started to return to Key
"West and signaled to the squadron to
that effect and so informed the depart
ment, and it might he inferred that he im
mediately obeyed that order and ascer
tained the presence of the enemy at San
tiago. On the contrary, his telegram dat
ed May 28, and written May 27, shows
that, though just having received the tel
egram of the department and having on
hand a sufficient supply of coal to return
to Key West, he reported that he could
not obey the order and continued to pro
teed to "Key West. However, it later be
< ame evident to him that this was unne
ry and he resumed the movement
toward Santiago.
Another point In Admiral Schley"s
letter is touched upon in the following
manner:
Admiral Schley's mention of the signal
of Admiral Sampson at 5;45 a. m. July 3â
"Disregard movements of the commander
in chief," and his mention of the move

trolled by the various treaty nations,
all of whom have advantages in their
occupation over the Chinese Govern
ment itself. At Shanghai the United
States has its only direGt interest in a
Chinese holding, being one of the
treaty powers and having a distinctly
American concession. The larger ports
remaining there are only Swatow, Fu
chau and Ning-Po, which are really in
control of the Chinese Government.
There is a large and desirable area
in the Gulf of Pechili on the northern
coast in which Asiatic dispatches inti
mate that the United States may have
an interest if the dismemberment of
China is ultimately effected. This is
very landlocked, however, and its nar
row entrance is wholly commanded by
Port Arthur on one side and by Wei-
Hai-Wei on the other. The authorized
disclaimer given out to-day, however,
<pf any purpose on the part of the
United States to acquire any territory
in that or any other portion of China
makes, this consideration of little mo
merit.
ON THE EXTENSION OF
SHANGHAI SETTLEMENT
LONDON, March 7.â The Times pub
lishes the following dispatch from
Shanghai: The British, American and
German Consuls to-day (Monday) de
clined to hold further negotiations with
the Taotai of Shanghai on the question
of the extension of the foreign settle
ment, owing to the evasive and ob
structive tactics to which he has re
ported. They will demand that the
Viceroy appoint a special deputy to ar
range the matter.
TERRIBLE VOYAGE OF THE
SLOOP YACHT NELLIE

Blizzard, the Crew Scared

ing stick soap.
ment of the commander In chief toward
Sibonev is followed -by an incorrect infer
to wit, "This left me senior officer
present and necessarily clothed me with
the responsibilities of the command."
The signal above mentioned is one which
is frequently made in squadron and 13
never held us in any sense a relinquish
ment of command. It is made where, for
any reason, the flagship leaves its as
signed position, as was the case when the
New York left her habitual blockading
station the morning of July 3. At such
times it is made to avoid confusion..
Without further signal the responsibility
of command would not be shifted until
the senior officer had gone out of signal
distance.
The statement concludes with the fol
lowing:
The department furnishes the foregoing
statement only to complete the record in
iiance with the request of the Sen
ate of January 23. Desiring to do Ad
mirals Sampson und Schley full justice
for services rendered H has, after full
consideration of all the circumstances,
recomm. nd>-d to the President their pro
motion.to the grade of rear. admiral and
begs to express the hope that his recom
mendations to the same may be confirmed
by the Senate.
Annexed to the letter. from the Sec
retary is one from Captain- Sigsbee in
reply to Admiral Schley's reference to
him as commander of the scout steamer
St. Paul, quoting him as authority for
the opinion that Cervera's lleet was
not in Santiago harbor. On this point
Sigsbee says:
"What I actually said to the admiral
was that Pilot Nunez had first ex
pressed the belief that such large ves
sels as Cervera's cruisers could not get
into Santiago because of their length,
but he afterward admitted that they I
might get in with the aid of tugs, j
* â¢ â¢ Every officer on board the St. j
Paul knew that I believed Gervera to- !
be at Santiago; nevertheless I consid- I
ered Nunez' opinion."
He says that he first saw the fleet in
the harbor May 29, and signaled Ad
miral Schley, and adds:
'â¢While I had not known, from pre
vious observation, that Cervera's fleet
was in Santiago, I believed that it was j
there, because I had been so informed
by the Navy Department, and during !
the eight days the St. Paul remained i
o-ff Santiago the different vessels j
touching there and communicating
with me had brought no counter re
port from the Navy Department."
With reference to the statement that !
he had confirmed the difficulty of coal- j
ing off Santiago, Captain Sigsbee says: j
"There had been weather unfavorable <
for coaling, but I remember no state- ;
ment of mine relative to coaling made j
to the admiral excepting on the morn
ing when we jointly discovered the I
Spanish vessels. The commanding of- j
fleers were assembled on board the ;
Brooklyn. On that occasion I twice ;
informed the admiral that the weather |
then prevailing was unusually favor- I
able for coaling at sea and I recom
mended that advantage be taken of it j
on the ground that so good an oppor- j
tunity could not be expected often. At >
the same time I expressed the belief I
that Guantanamo Bay should be seized j
as a base, not necessarily by Admiral :
Schley, but as soon as the troops were
available to hold the place."

BAILEY'S COURSE APPROVED
BY TEXAS LEGISLATURE
But His Action in Opposing Gallant
Joe Wheeler Is Vigorously
Denounced.
AUSTIN, Tex., March fi.â There was a
| lively discussion in the- House this after
i noon over a resolution offered by Repre
| sentative "W'ootten indorsing the action of
Congressman Bailey In protesting against
the seating of Congressman Joseph
Wheeler. Representative Tarviver was
recognized, and protested against the
adoption of the resolution, saying that
while he had* a great personal admiration
for Bailey he saw no reason why his poli
tical future anent the United States Sena
torial race two years hence should be
boosted to- the detriment of gallant old
Joe Wheeler, who went to the front in the
interests of his country.
Representative Bailey, from Dewitt,
spoke in favor of the resolution, saying
that Rail<\v was a patriot in fighting for
the sound principles of Democracy, and
the people of the South and the press had
sounded their approval of his course, and
the Legislature should do likewise.
Mr. Kittrell regretted exceedingly that
i the possibility of Rajley being 1 a candidate
I for United States Senator two years hence
should be dragged into the discussion at
this- time, when it was decidedly out of
place and not at all in keeping with the
Fentiment of the resolution. After some
furfhei discussion the House adopted the
resolution by a viva voce vote.

M. Lockroy, Minister of Marine, in the
course with an interview had with him
by a representative of the Gaulois, said
that none' of the theories advanced were
admissible.. "Imprudence on the part of
the personnel," he added, "was impossi

hours after the gates had been closed.
The heating theory, too, is unsound, as
the temperature of the buildings was al

DEATH CLAIMS
KIPLING'S CHILD
Six-Year-Old Josephine
Passes Away.
SUCCUMBS TO PNEUMONIA
THE AUTHOR NOT INFORMED OF
HIS LOSS.
Though He Is Gradually Gaining
Strength, He Is Considered
Too Weak to Withstand
the Shock.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 6.â Josephine
Kipling, the six-year-old daughter of
Rudyard Kipling, and the oldest of his
three children, died shortly after 6
o'clock this morning from pneumonia.
The child's death took place at the
home of Mrs. Julie de Forest in this
city. Mrs. de Forest is a friend of the
Kiplings, and Josephine had been taken
to her home so that she could be
nursed apart from her father. The girl
became ill the day after Mr, Kipling
took to his bed.
Mr. Kipling continues to improve,
having slept naturally the greater part,
of last night. He has taken no solid
food and it may be a week before he is
able to do so. He is subsisting on beef
extract, milk and other fluid nutrients.
Elsie, Mr. Kipling's three-year-old
daughter, passed a good night.
In all probability the body of little
Josephine Kipling will be taken to the
Kipling home in Vermont for burial,
! but no definite arrangements have yet
I been made. It was decided not to in
| form the author of his child's death for
| several days. It was said at the hotel
! this morning that Mrs. Kipling has not
been allowed in her husband's room for
oiearly a week, notwithstanding the
general understanding that she has
been at his bedside daily.
The following bulletin was issued at
2:30 to-day:
Air. Kipling has done well during the
1 lawt twenty-four hours. Now that reso
| lution is almost complete he has some
discomfort from the more free manage
; tnent of the lungs, due to the greater
j rubbing of the inriamed pleura. This is
a. very common accompaniment to pneu
monia. The next bulletin will not be is
sued until Wednesday.
Mr. Doubleday at 7:80 o'clock said:
"Mr. Kipling has had a splendid day
i â that is, a comfortable day. He is be
' ginning gradually to take nourishment
lof a more substantial kind. Of course,
j he has the appearance of a man who
j has been at the point of death, and his
mind works very slowly. He has not
! been told of his daughter Josephine's
: death. Elsie has been somewhat bet
\ U'r to-day and I think she is well on
j the road to recovery."
Then, referring to a slip In his hand,
I he said:
"After talking the matter over with
j me, Mrs. Kipling derided to make this
; request to the newspapers:
"It is Mrs. Kipling's earnest wish that
i all matters connected with the funeral
of her daughter Josephine may be en
tirely private. She appreciates the fact
that information concerning Mr. Kip
ling is of public interest, but this sor
row is her own, and she feels sure that
newspaper reporters and editors will
not wish to intrude upon her privacy."
Mr. Doubleday went on to say that
: Mrs. Kipling did not wish even. the time
| or place of her daughter's funeral to be
] made public. Mr. Doubleday said there
were a number of reasons that induced
| her to make that decision, and one of
! them was that for Mr. Kipling.'s sake
\ the death and funeral of Josephine
must be passed as quickly and quietly
;as possible. Mrs. Kipling knew, he
1 said, that the papers could find out
j everything if they tried, but in this
| case she asked them not to do so.
ENGLAND'S SYMPATHY.
London Papers Voice the Grief of
Britons.
LONDON, March 7.â The morning
papers almost universally voice the
deep sympathy in the bereavement
that has come to the Kipling family
through the death of Josephine. The
Daily News, sensibly suggests that
there should be some intermission in
the private telegrams and letters of in
quiry which call far Mrs. Kipling's per
sonal acknowledgment, adding that "it
is unnecessary to impose upon the sore
ly stricken wife and mother a cere
monial duty only less exacting than a
reception of callers."
Emperor William's dispatch to Mrs.
Kipling was intended, the Daily News
thinks, to pay a double debt, "as the
Kaiser has notorious reasons for desir
ing to conciliate â  both America and
England." â 
IN THE TRACK OF THE
TENNESSEE TORNADO
Great Strip of Territory Covered by
the Storm and Considerable
Damage to Buildings.
KNOXVILLE, Term., March 6.â The
Madisonville storm horror is even greater
than was at first reported. The section
devastated by the terrible hurricane of
Saturday night has been visited to-day
by thousands. It is the universal verdict
that never In the history of East Ten
nessee has such an event been known. "
The tornado extended twenty miles,
commencing near Je.llico Junction and
continuing to a point twelve miles north
of Madisonville. It so happened, however,
that no residences were in its course, save
those razed at Madisonville and four
small homes in the town of Nlnaburg.
Many barns were destroyed and at least
fifty hordes, mules and cattle were killed.
In addition to the list of injured fur
nished last night there is Dillon Rogers,
a prominent jeweler of Madisonville,
.struck on the head by a falling brick.
His hom<- was almost completely demol
ished. Miss Willie Erwin, whp was the
most seriously injured person, cannot re
cover. ' Her condition to-night is most
critical. Mrs. Horton, wife of the man
who was killed, Is in a serious condition.
A subscription was started to-day for the
benefit of the storm sufferers.

THAT MARRIAGE
TO JAY GOULD
Interesting Letters in the
Cody Case.
LIKE A BLACKMAILING SCHEME
MRS. ANGELL AS THE ALLEGED
WIFE OF THE MILLIONAIRE.
Mrs. Cody's Anxiety to Meet George
Gould Because She Had the
Key to the Whole
Situation.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ALBANY, N. V., March 6.â Mrs.
Sarah Angell and John Angell, the
missing witnesses in the Cody case,
were on hand at the opening of court
to-day. Mrs. Angell is the woman who
it was contended had been married to
Jay Gould and who was the mother of
his child.
The first witness to.-day was Mrs.
Sequin of Rouses Point, who testified
to having written a letter to Mrs.
Beebe, at the dictation of Mrs. Cody,
in which she indirectly asked for funds
with which to prosecute her investiga
tion as to the marriage of Jay Gould
and Mary Brown. She said in the let
ter that while it would be very difficult
to procure a marriage record the other
(the birth record) was "now all right."
A second letter, identified by Mrs. Se
quin as from Mrs. Cody to Mrs. iieebe,
asked for $100 and told that Mrs.
Pierces lawyer had arrived in Albany
with a deposition from Mrs. Angell to
the effect that she was never married
to Jay Gould. The marriage, the depo
sition set forth, was to a Frenchman
named Vidas, "who starved her." Mrs.
Cody's letter continues: "I think the
woman is crazy. I am going to try to
get an affidavit from her to the effect
that she had a child by Jay Gould.
Isn't it a shame that the villain at
this late day should fail us?"
â  A third letter to Mrs. P-eebe tells of
Mrs. Cody's anxiety to meet George
Gould personally, because, as she says,
she "has the key of the whole situation"
in her hands. "If the case goes to
trial," she proceeds, "you and I will be
dead and buried, for that old fool is
constantly changing her mind and
every now and then contends that she
was never married to Gould."
Nicholas J. Dack had written some
letters in 1895 for Mrs. Cody, who had
asked him if he could write in more
than one kind of handwriting. One of
the letters which he had written and
which was dated Oswego, N. V., and
signed H. Moore, was to Miss Helen
Gould and suggested to her the advisa
bility of personally seeing Mrs. Cody,
"who had control of the entire case and
was in a position to put an end to the
entire scandal."
Still another letter to George Gould
told of the case against the Goulds
having been placed in Mrs. Cody's
hands by Mrs. Pierce, the alleged
daughter of Jay Gould. It suggested a
personal meeting with Mr. Gould with
a view to putting a stop to the pro
ceedings which threatened.
The most significant testimony ad
duced to-day was that of David N. Car
valho, a handwriting expert, who, by a
chemical test in the presence of the
jury, showed that the record in the
book of the Cooperville church had been
erased and changed, and that the name
of Mary Brown, the supposed wife of
Jfty Gould, had 6een written over a
blank space, ' the word "illegitimate"
changed to "legitimate," and in the
place where the name of the mother of
the illegitimate child had originally
been written was interpellated the
name "Jay Gould."
This proof, in connection with the
strong testimony of Mrs. Hoyle of
Rouse's Point to the effect that th"
original Sarah Ann Brown was dead
and that the present Mrs. Angell (the
supposed pretender to the name and
family of Gould) was only a niece of
the woman who was mentioned in the
already disputed birth notice, put the
case of the defense in a nearly hopeless
condition.
It is intended, however, by the de
fense to prove that, although basis for
the claim against the Goulds never
really existed. Mrs. Cody believed â¢in
her case, having been buoyed up and
encouraged by two lawyers, William
McMurtrie Speer and Amasa J. Parker
Jr., who assured her that they were al
ready in possession of facts similar to
those -which she thought she had.
ENGLAND AND FRANCE.
How the Muscat Incident Was Satis
factorily Settled.
PARIS, March 6.â ln the Chamber of
Deputies to-day M Burneau, Progressive
Republican, representing the First Dis
trict of the Islands of Reunion, questioned
the Government on the subject of the
Muscat incident. The Minister of Foreign
Affairs, M. Delcasse, declared that the
facts were that the British Resident sum
moned the Sultan to withdraw a conces
sion to France of a coal depot on a creek
near Muscat. The Sultan thereupon asked
France to return the deed of concession,
and France refused.
The Sultan then cancelled the conces-
ceived by the Conservatives and the
business world, but the Democrats de
nounce it as representing the most ul
tramontane section of the Conserva
tives. The Weylerites are violently op
posed to the Cabinet and stormy times
are predicted. The elections to the Cor
tes will take place in April.
A number of repatriated soldiers
made a demonstration at Valencia yes
terday evening. They marched through
the streets headed by a banner in
scribed. "Long Live the Army" and
"We Are Hungry." The processionists
were dispersed by the police, but there
was no serious disorder.
The Cabinet council this afternoon
decided to make immediate payment of
arrears of pay to the repatriated
troops
The Duke of Tetuan, former Minister
of Foreign Affairs, and twenty-seven
Conservative Senators and Deputies,
have decided to oppose the Government
and will form a dissident group.
Bion. Great Britain, however, quickly ad
mitted France's right to the coal depot
and expressed deep rrgret at the incident.
France thus obtained prompt and com
plete satisfaction, and the incident was
considered closed.
The Foreign Minister concluded by of
ficially corroborating the statement that
negotiations are proceeding between
Franco and Great Britain for a delimi
tation of their African frontiers in a
sincere spirit of conciliation, and with
th^ view of reaching an arrangement
which will guarantee a lasting under
standing betwen the two countries.
ALEXANDER CAMPBELL'S
BATTLE WITH DEATH
The Aged Jurist Removed to the
Sisters' Hospital in Los
Angeles.
LOS ANGELES, March 6.â Judge
Alexander Campbell, the a#ed jurist
who was seriously injured late Satur
day night by falling from a street car,
was this morning removed to the Sis
ters' Hospital, where he is reported to
be resting as easily as could be ex
pected. The Judge has just passed his
79th birthday. The aged sufferer glept
Saturday and Sunday nights under
opiates.
The trip to the hospital necessarily
gave him much pain, but his doctor
spoke hopefully of an ultimate recov
ery.
Judge Campbell was until Saturday
night in active consulting'practice. He
was admitted to the bar in 1842, and
probably has the longest record as a
practitioner in the State.
Among the notable cases in which
Judge Campbell took part were those
of the peojile against Terry for the
killing of Senator Broderick in a duel;
the case against Charles Cora for the
murder of United States Marshal Rich
ardson; the Bretherton forgery case;
the impeachment of Judge Hardy be
fore tho Legislature; trie defense of the
San Francisco Chronicle in a series of
libel suits brought by Senator Sargent
and Congressman Page; the case of
Laura Fair for the murder of Judge
Crittenden, and the case against Kal
loch for the murder of Charles de
Young, proprietor of the Chronicle.
SCENES OF LIFE AND

Last Chapter" and Miss
Kelleher's Lecture.

called "The Last Chapter." written by
George H. Broadhurst, author of "What
Happened to Jones" and "Why Smith
Left Home," was presented in this city
last night at the Garden Theater, and was
received with much favor.
"The Last Chapter" commingles serious
with comic ingredients of personality and
incident, ajid it aims to present a picture
of American character, life and manners
in Southern California. The principal
parts were acted by Edgar Davenport,
Edwin Holt, Miss Grace Filkins and Miss
Bllle Wilton, who formerly played juven
ile heroines and were great favorites in
Sari Francisco.
Miss Helen Kelleher, the well-known el
ocutionist and dramatic reader, gave a
lecture on "California, the Land of
Health, Wealth and Beauty," at the Wal
dorf-Astoria to-night in aid of the chari
table work of the Parish House Associa
tion of All Angels Church. The lecture
was illustrated by 200 beautiful and strik
ingly realistic views of scenery in the
West thrown upon a large screen by
stereopticon and was very interesting.
Miss Kelleher possesses a pleasing pres
ence, an easy manner and perfect enun
ciation, and to these attractions she adds
ready wit and fine descriptive powers.
Under the spell of her eloquent voice and
illusion of pictures the audience was car
ried rapidly and easily across the conti
nent to the Pacific Coast, and shown tne
wonders and beautiful scenery of the
mountains, valleys and plains and notable
buildings and features of Salt Lake City,
Sacramento. New Orleans. San Francisco
and other important cities.
The views of the Yosemite Valley were
especially applauded. They composed
the fair Mariposa big tree grove, Yosemite
Falls El Capitan, Three Sentinels,
Cathedral Towers, Inspiration Point,
Bridal Veil Falls, Vernal Fails arid other
places of interest. . A considerable sum
was realized for the church fund.

Charles A. Keeler lectured to a large

valuable acquisitions to the Academy
Museum, and entreated those present to
assist the society in making the exhibit
a fountainhead for the dissemination of
knowledge.
"The old idea of a museum," said he,
"was that ef a place where freaks of
nature and oddities might be collected to
satisfy the curious. We propose to make
the museum in connection with tha
Academy a power of instruction as well
as of entertainment. What will satisfy
the public will not satisfy the student. A

layman, but the technical student re
quires a different display. He must have
much of everything and species must bo
classified and particularized.
"A vast amount of material, which
would be a cause of bewilderment to one
not interested in study, is alone adapted
to accomplish the result of converting the
exhibit into a source of knowledge, and wa
propose to secure and classify our collec

Filipinos. Th^ enemy's dead numbered
twenty. Returns now in show that five
Americans were wounded.
Two battalions of the Twentieth reg
ular infantry have reinforced General
Hale's brigade. All the native huts
have been destroyed at Mariquina and
the country there is pretty well cleared,
but the rebels were returning in small
bodies at sundown.
Apparently they have received a new
supply of smokeless ammunition re
cently, as there has h^r-n a noticeable
difference during the last few days.
The insurgents in the viclnitv of the
r works were finally dispersed this
morning by General King's brigade
Three members of the Nebraska regi
ment, two Washington men and two
ambulance men were wounded. The
enemy used two new cannon, but with
out effect.
2:45 p. m. â There was considerable
outpost skirmishing last night at San
Tolan, in which the Colorado and Ne
braska infantry with the guns of the
Utah battery took part. General Hale'a
brigade to-day located 250 insurgents,
with two guns, near San Pedro. The
were so placed as to be capable of
enfilading General Wheaton's brigade.
The insurgents are placing guns in
position at various points. The opinion
of all prominent men in Manila is that
the military force of the insurgent oli
garchy must be broken before a stable
government can be established in the
islands.

WASHINGTON. March 6.â A cablegram from General Otis at Ma

reception accorded to the American troops which recently landed at the
island of Negros. One battalion of the First California Regiment was
sent there by General Miller at Iloilo, in command of Colonel James F.
Smith, with orders to take formal possession for the United States, which
he did without trouble.
Previous to th-=> time the troops landed a commission from the islands
visited General Otis and said they were willing to surrender and asked
that he take the inhabitants under his protection. The congratulatory
address to General Miller, embodied in General Otis' dispatch, is particu
larly gratifying to the officials of the administration, as they believe the
feeling among the inhabitants cf the island of Negros is such that there
will be no trouble in dealing with thÂ»:m hereafter.
General Otis' dispatch is as follows:

YON DIEDRICHS WAS
WANTING IN TACT
Removed From Command of the
Asiatic Squadron Because He
Offended Americans.
BERLIN. March f> â A high official of
the German Navy Department has in
formed the correspondent here of the
Associated Press that the appointment
of Prince Henry of Prussia, brother of
Emperor William, to the. command of
the East Asiatic squadron, had been
considered for months past, and was
finally decided on' as being the most
available.. The Emperor desires to
Show the American people that he is
thoroughly friendly, and he knows that
Prince Henry is popular in the United
States.
When the official referred to was
asked if the appointment was equiva
lent to the disgrace of Admiral yon
Diedrlchs. he said:
"Not exactly. Still, if Admiral yon
Dledrfchs had shown more tact last
summer before Manila it would unde
niably have been productive of good re
suits all around. Our Government, un
fortunately, was advised too late of a
number of occurrences before Manila,
none of which were really important,
but which showed grave want of tact
upon Admiral yon Diedrichs' part. The
main trouble was that the admiral was
insufficiently informed regarding inter
national naval usages in such a delicate
situation. Consequently he continued
naval movements, drill and searchlight
practice as if elsewhere than in a block
aded port, thus arousing distrust upon
the part of the Americans."
The above is important as being the
first German official admission that
there had been trouble between the
Germans and Americans in Manila Bay.

AMERICAN FORCES
IN THE PHILIPPINES
AND ON THE WAY
Soon Uncle Sam Will Have a
Combined Strength There of
41,000 Men.
WASHINGTON, March 6.â Forty-one
thousand officers and men of the com
bined army and navy forces comprise
the approximate total American
strength now at, en route and under
orders for service for the Philippines.
No further reinforcements are now in
contemplation. The forces of the two
services already stationed in and about
the archipelago consist of twenty regi
ments of infantry, one engineer bat
talion, seven troops of cavalry and
eleven batteries of artillery, an aggre
gate of about 24,500 men. Nineteen
vessels, with an aggregate of 297 offi
cers, 2990 men and 253 marines make
up the naval contingent. This is ex
clusive of the transport Solace* with
161' officers and men all told, which is
constantly passing back and forth from
Manila, There are about 4800 army re
inforcements on the way to Manila,
making as rapid progress as possible,
and there are, roughly estimated, 7500
men in the force under orders to pro
ceed to the Philippines.
The following vessels are now at Ma

of Admiral Dewey: Baltimore, Ben
nington, Boston, Buffalo, Callao,
Charleston, Concord, Culgoa, Don Juan

cer?. 2990 sailors and 253 marines. The
transport Solace does not remain at
Manila.
Th^ Castine and Princeton arc now on
their way through the Red Sea to j"in
Admiral Dewey and the Oregon and her
! attendant vessel, the Iris, are traveling
', through the Pacific to the same desti
nation. These vessels will add to the
naval forces at Manila 59 officers, 739
I men and 84 marines. The captured
Bhips Don Juan de Austria, Isla d<-
Luzon and Isla de Cuba are not avail
: able for immediate service as they are
jin need of repairs. The Solace ha*
taken out a number <>f recruits and
with these the Isla de Luzon will be
manned. The Wheeling will Join the
Manila fleet, but is not to be counted
jas being available in the immediate
j future.
The regular troops now in the Phil
ippine Islands under command of Ma-
Jor-General Otis, consist of the follow
ing: The Fourteenth United States In

Special tflsratch to The Call.
NEW YORK. March 6.â The Wash
ington correspondent of the Herald |
telegraphs: Secretary of War Alger
has finally had a plain talk with the
President regarding his continuation in
the cabinet, in view of the strong op
position to him that has been mani
fested throughout the country.
A member of the Cabinet is authorl
j ty for the statement that Secretary Al
i ger told the President that, rather than !
i subject the administration to any em
| barrassment, he would retire; but he
j said he did not want to go out under
I fire while the hostile criticism of the
i War Department was at its height.
He suggested that in order to allow
! him to get out of the Cabinet as grace
fully as possible, he be allowed to sug
gest the name of his successor.
In the conversation that followed Sec
retary Alger remarked that he had seen
the President and that he would like to
have a New York man in the Cabinet, |
and the name, of General Anson Q. Me- \
k was mentioned. |
Secretary Alger is said to have asked
the President not to appoint General I
McCook, saying that the general was j
', his enemy and had referred to him as a j
â  â¢'sissy." Under the circumstances, he ;
I declared that General McCooks ap
pointment a* his successor would be
a personal insult to him.
I am informed that there was some
i further discussion of various New York
men in connection with the place, in
i the course of which it developed that
! Governor Roosevelt would like very
much to have Elihu Root given a place j
in the Cabinet. Some question was
: raised, however, as to whether Senator '
: - Platt would be pleased with the ap
pointment of Mr. R
Vallejo Pioneer Gone.

In addition to these another company
f"r the signal corps has just been
formed at Manila, being recruited by
the transfer from th>- regular branch
of the army. This means of making up
the new company was made necessary
by the lack of time for dispatch of men
from the United States.
Reinforcements for the Philippines
now on the way aggregate in the
neighborhood of 4800 men all told. These
are made up of three general expedi- I
tions, as follows: The transport Grant,
with General Lawton and staff, with a
total of 64 officers and 716 men, includ
ing one battalion of the Seventeenth
Infantry and four companies <-f the i
Fourth Infantry. This expedition
sailed from New York January 19, was
reported at Singapore on Saturday, and
General Lawton cabled General Otis
that his expedition will reach Manila in
the early morning of the 10th inst. The
transport Sherman, Colonel J. H. Page
commanding, carrying a total of 34 of
ficers anil 1702 men, including the en
tire Third Infantry Regiment and a
battalion of the Seventeenth Infantry.
The Sherman sailed from New York
February 5. The transport Sheridan,
under command of Lieutenant <"<>lonel
J. H. Smith of the Twelfth infantry.
carries all of the Twelfth and a bat
talion of the Seventeenth Infantry,
making a total of 57 officers and 1796
men. Besides, the Roanoke, with a
fair sized detachment of recruits for
the various regiments already in the j
archipelago, has a good start on
the way to Manila, and the transport i
Valencia Bailed from San Francisco for \
Manila via Honolulu with l'>'> recruits j
for the infantry, artillery ami hospital
corps and a number of West I'nint
graduates assigned to duty with vari
ous companies in the Philippines.
To swell this formidable list of men j
already in the field and en route, five
regiments of infantry and the crack
Sixth Artillery, with an approximate
strength additional of 7500 men in all, |
are under orders to proceed to Manila '
at the earliest opportunity. These re- j
Inforcements, which go to the archi- i
pelago under an i>rder issued by the j
War Department last week, complete |
the roll of troops, so far as contemplat
ed, for service in the islands, and are
as follows: The Sixth United States I
Infantry, now at San Antonio; the
Nfnth United States Infantry, at Madi
son Barracks; the Thirteenth United j
States Infantry, in New York State; |
the Sixteenth United States Infantry, at
Fi*rt Crook and neighboring points;
the Twenty-first United States Infan
try, at Plattsburg. N. V., and the Sixth
United States Artillery. r."\v scattered
aJong the Atlantic coast at a number j
of points. The date <rf departure has |
not yet been fixed, but they are ex- I
pected to be at Manila May 15. If con- !
ditions are satisfactory when they !
reach Manila, it is likely that a corre- :
sponding number of volunteers may be ;
brought home.
On account of the calling out of so j
many troops for the Philippines, thÂ°
War Department has decided to defer i
fur two months the sending of a garri
son to Honolulu. All of the transports
available on the Pacific side will be j
needed to carry reinforcements to Gen
eral Otis.

sinl^ With a foundered Vessel
flfter Ha 9 Been Ordered
Off the Traosport.
O TACOMA, March 6.â John "Wickstrom, formerly quartermaster of Â©
O the transport Arizona, has reached here from Hongkong with news O
O of the death of three sailors who shipped on the Arizona at San O
O Francisco. The unfortunates were George Forrester, Charles Turner O
O and "Jack" Kahn. Their lives were lost in a typhoon in the South- O
O em Ocean which sank a coasting schooner on which they were go- Q
O ing to Manila, drowning all hands. O
Â© Wickstrom says the sailors were very badly used by Captain O
Â© Ames of the Arizona, and that they were going to Manila to bring Â©
Â© suit against the Quartermaster's Department for wages for the year's O
Â© service for which they had signed. They had worked night and O
Â© day at Manila, and on being refused shore leave at Hongkong went O
Â© ashore without permission. On their return they were ordered off the O
O ship. O
Â© Consul Wildman heard their case and decided they should go with O
O the vessel. It is claimed that to avoid taking them the Arizona sailed O
O several hours before her time. O
Â© To get to Manila the trio shipped on a rickety coasting vessel fly- Â©
O ing the English flag. The schooner was hardly out of port before O
O a terrible typhoon came up. She is believed to have foundered in the O
O gale without giving the crew time to take to the boats, as none was Â©
O saved. O
O Wickstrom has a few troubles of his own. He will bring suit O
Â© very shortly to recover a year's pay from the Quartermaster's De- Q
O partment. He. was shipped before the Arizona left, at $50 a month, Q
O and has never signed the release. He was sent ashore at Hongkong O
O with six sailors, including the three that were drowned. Consul Â©
Â© Wildman is alleged to have ordered Captain Ames to take them Â©
O back on board, but he engaged a Chinese crew and left pert before O
Â© the Consul's orders could be enforced. The Chinese were paid $20 O
O instead of $30 which the white sailors drew. Wickstrom says the cap- Â©
Â© tain did not put up the necessary deposit at the Hongkong sailors' Â©
O boarding house for any of the men. The port regulations require O
Â© $50 for each sailor left. O

As the result of a conference at the
White House this afternoon between
President McKinley and Secretary Al

of the decision of the Government not
to raise the volunteer force of 35,000
men until the regular army was in

There is no question as to the right
' of the President to appoint five addi

has been recruited to the maximum
'< strength authorized by the act. namely

ing Case of Mrs. Allen Against
Ogden Smith.
WASHINGTON, March 6. â Justice
Brown of the Unit* Bi fes Supreme
Court to-day handed (imvn the opinion of
th^ court in a case involving the question
as to whether the producer of sugar cano
or the manufacturer of sugar is entitled
to the bounty paid bj the Government.
The case wan that of Mrs. Bettie Allen
vs. Ogden Smith. Mrs. Allen being the
widow of the late Richard F. Allen, a
large sugar planter of Louisiana. The
Louisiana Supreme Court allowed Mrs.
Allen only half of the bounty allowed, the
total sum being J11.567, hut to-day's deci
sion reversed this decision, giving her the
full sum. oh the ground that she was the
actual manufacturer of the sugar and
that the manufacturer and not the cano
grower is entitled to the Government
bounty. Justice Brown remarked that
the cane grower would necessarily receive
his share of the bounty through the en
hanced price "i" cane caused by the allow
ance of a bounty.

A HOPELESS CASE.
THE report that a number of the so-called
"county"' officials elected in this city at the last
election contemplate inaugurating litigation by
which the question whether they have been chosen
under the county government act or under the new
charter may be decided by the Supreme Court brings
up a political subject of considerable interest. Of
course all these officials were elected with the under
standing that they would serve one year, but, not
withstanding that fact, it is not difficult to sympa
thize with them in their effort to hold on for four
years. An office is a precious thing, and to give it
up is always heart-rending.
But physical pain should not induce anybody to
undertake so hopeless a lawsuit as the one the local
officials in question have under consideration. There .
is no doubt whatever that the Freeholders who framed '
the new charter possessed the power to fix the terms ;
of all municipal officers and employes. In 1896 the
people adopted a constitutional amendment declaring
among other things that it shall be competent in all
charters framed under section 8 of article XI of the
lie bw "to provide for the manner in which, the
times at which and the terms for which the sev
eral county officers shall be elected or appointed, for
their compensation and for the number of deputies
tnat each shall have, and for the compensation pay
able to each of such deputies."
As if to dispense with all doubt as to the applica
tion of this provision, the same amendment speaks in
terms of city and county governments which shall
have been "merged and consolidated into one muni
cipal government." The only question remaining in
connection with the terms of officials under the new
charter is whether the instrument went into effect in
time to cover the election of last year, in other words,
whether the "county" officials elected in 1898 were
chosen under it or under the State law. But this can
not, it seems to us, enter into the controversy. The
grant of power quoted above in any event would
authorize the charter-makers to shorten the terms of
municipal officials, and it could not make any differ
ence to such officials when the new instruments went
into effect.
Under the circumstances it would appear that the
less time our local government expends in endeavor
ing to hold on the better. The Supreme Court can
not avoid deciding against the so-called "county"
officials. "What these gentlemen should do is to make
a good record and get ready for the fall campaign.
BRUTES ON THE BICYCLE.
SUNDAY a lady riding in the park was fun down
by a scorcher. The fellow was absolutely with
out excuse. He was coasting along the path
â¢with his feet over the handle-bars, a position from
which he could not possibly recover quickly to meet
the emergency likely to arise. Anybody but a fool
would have realized this, and a fool has no business
en a wheel.
The regulations of the park do not permit coasting.
A person guilty of such an offense against common
sense is subject to arrest, and he ought to be subject
to incarceration in an asylum for lunatics. Neverthe
less, the person guilty of subjecting the injured lady
to the peril of death was coasting merrily down
Strawberry Hill, and that his foolhardiness did not re
sult in murder is no credit to himself. Had he killed
the woman he would have gone on, as he did go,
anxious to escape the result of his criminal careless
ness. It is to be hoped that the coward will yet be
caught and made to pay some sort of penalty for his
bnital stupidity.
Thousands of San Francisco people ride the wheel.
They are entitled to protection. Most of them choose
tc ride in the park, because there there is a path for
them, smooth track, and comparatively level grades.
But if a woman-killing nincompoop is not subject to
restraint it appears that they are not sufficiently pro
tected. If every dolt whose brain swells the calf of
his legs is at liberty to maim or slay others who may
desire to ride, the bicycle path loses a measure of its
charm. We suggest that two park policemen be de
tailed to mount bicycles instead of steeds and patrol
the path given to the use of bicyclists. When they
observe an idiot coasting, to the peril of everybody
else, it will be their duty to gather him in and put
him where he will be incapable of harm.
"The American Boy" does not in our judgment
constitute a suitable name for a warship. There are
several ships in prospect, and there is not yet a Cali
fornia.
If Dreyfus would consent to die, and thereby live
up to current rumor, France could afford to extend
him a vote of thanks.
THE CAUCUS TRICK-
TWENTY-SEVEN legislative supporters oi
Daniel M. Burns, who have misrepresented their
constituencies and lowered themselves and the
State by their determination to force his election,
even though it should wreck the Republican party,
have declared their intention to continue the dead
lock at Sacramento unless their kind -of a caucus is
held. These gentlemen were elected from Assembly
! and Senatorial districts, not one of which tolerates
their choice, and every vote they have cast was a
breach of their representative obligations. They in
structed Senator Perkins to vote for the treaty" of
Paris, and against his personal convictions he obeyed
the instruction. But they have arrogantly and con
tumaciously asserted the right to disregard the
voices of the communities from which they came, to
tear instructions to pieces and to gratify their pri
vate inclinations, in whatever manner controlled, in
direct opposition to public sentiment.
The word "caucus" is generally used as a desig
nation of political gatherings to discuss party
measures. It is now proposed to twist its sig
r.ification into a method of securing a unanimous
and secret indorsement of an incompetent and dis
graced candidate for Senatorial honors in such a man
ner that the responsibility shall fall upon an en
tire party, and noi on individual legislators. It is
well that Republicans throughout the State, who are
among its most enterprising, intelligent and hon
ored citizens, should be formally apprised of the
treatment to which it is designed to subject them at
the bidding of the railroad. But they are too inde
pendent and too decent, and Ihey have too much
pride in the history and the achievements of the poli
j tical organization to which they are attached, by the
i tie of principle and not of pelf, to submit to a de
f liberate act of treachery that could not be cor.sum-
I mated in the face of day nor without secret mani
pulation of the most dishonorable nature. No man fit
to be a Senator of the United States could endure the
situation over which Dan Burns fiendishly gloats.
1 With no antecedents to recommend him, calied for by
I no substantial portion of his party, and indeed, out
! side of the Legislature, almost unanimously repu
i dialed because he has the railroad push and the Ex
â¢ aminer behind him, he has braved popular denuncia- :
tion and threatened in terms to deprive the State of j
one representative in the upper house oi. Congress,
and thus to insure the defeat of the party, unless the
prolonged intrigue on his behalf is successful. His
barefaced assumption is that he can turn his minority
into a majority if new recruits can only be saved from !
personal identification.
Oui respect for the Legislature forbids us to anti
cipate anything less than the ignominious failure of
this last and most abominable effort to debase the
Republican party and to place it in the attitude of pro- j
claiming its own shame by accepting the railroad J
falsehoods during the last canvass and the candidacy
it failed to disclose until after the election. These
twenty-seven Senators and Assemblymen, in their
manifesto, which amounts almost to threats and to
menaces within the definitions of the Civil Code, ap
peal to representative institutions as supplying the
logical reason for the conspiracy they label as a de
mand for a caucus. This stuff is unworthy of a de
bate in a corner grocery. When they advocate Burns
whom do they represent? Do they represent the
citizens who elected them? Do they represent their
own families or their neighbors'? Do they repre
sent the intelligence, the educated citizenship, the
manhood, the honor of the State? If they do, the
evidences of these facts, not a scintilla of which has
so far been offered to the public eye or the public
ear, without a caucus, can be disinfected and produced.
Do they represent the railroad? If they do, and that
they do is indisputable, they would not dare to avow
that unspeakable dishonesty as a vindication of the
representative idea or of their fidelity to Republican
principles or to Republican policy. It takes sixty
votes, as the Legislature is now constituted, if all the
members are present, to elect a Senator. If through
a majority of a caucus, a minority of both houses,
thirty-three votes, should be added to the twenty
seven, and by this palpable fraud, against the will of
the Republican party and the people as a whole, Dan
Burns should be chosen, whom would the sixty repre
sent, and at what point would the representative prin
ciple come in? If a majority of a Legislature, which
is the immediate constituency of a Federal Senator,
can disregard their pledges and their constitutional
votes, and, by a secret, unofficial meeting convert that |
minority into a majority, it is too plain for argument
that the principle of representation is trodden into the
dirt and the fundamental theory of American institu
tions contemptuously violated. No chop logic or
brazen declamation can overturn this proposition.
There is not a sentence in the manifesto that is true
or even plausible. Its bold assertions could not de
ceive a child. It falsely parades ignorance, stupidity
and venality as the leaven that raises Republicans
to distinction. It is the mere edict of the railroad,
its last resort when other means have failed to justify
its rampant inebriety by driving its incompetent and
characterless agent like a wedge into the body of the
Senate and by pushing the beaten Democracy far into
the road toward victory.
This spectacular exhibition, -fortunately for the
country, has never before been equaled. Why not
elect Crimmins or Kelly or even Buckley? Any of
them would be as acceptable as Dan Burns to the
citizens of California, who would prefer, however, and
have often demanded, the prompt selection of a Re
publican, a statesman and a gentleman.
& RAID ON THE TREASURY.
THE bill before the Legislature to establish day
schools for deaf mutes has no excuse for being,
except to give somebody or several somebodies
a job at the expense of the taxpayer. It proposes to
have the people pay at the rate of $150 per annum per
capita for the instruction in the public schools of
deaf mutes between the ages of 5 and 21 years, and
adds also the feeble-minded juveniles of imperfect
speech. These two classes are to be brought into the
day schools, to associate with other pupils, and be
taught by the person who is able to round up five of
them and take the $150 apiece which the State is to
pay.
The scheme is insufferable. The State has near
Berkeley an old and perfectly equipped institution for
deaf mutes. They are there taught by the most ad
vanced methods, so that they can enter any walk or
calling that is open to the non-defective classes. Sev
eral have gone from that institution into the State
University, so perfectly trained in lip reading that they
were under no disadvantage in the class and lecture
re oms and laboratory, and graduated just the same as
if they were physically normal. To that institution in
the future as in the past these juvenile deaf mutes
should go to be systematically trained in lip reading
and articulation, in which instruction it has long
ranked foremost in the world.
The utter disregard of the interests of the defective
shown by the day school bill is appalling. Again,
normal children should not be brought during their
infancy in contact with the defective, and especially
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MATICH 7, 1899.
not with the feeble-minded. The plan to introduce
the latter into association and daily contact with
young children in the day schools is more idiotic
than any of the proposed beneficiaries of the law.
Wise people have long known that it is not well to
have a nervous, sickly, deformed or physically de
fective teacher for young children, because, through
the influence of suggestion, great harm is wrought
upon the nervous systems of the pupils. This being
so, how much greater harm must come of mixing the
â  feeble-minded, the sad victims of prenatal blight, with
l normal children!
For the feeble-minded there is an institution at
Glen Ellen, where the highest scientific care is de
voted to their development, and they should be sent
there at. as early an age as possible, for if defective
brain cells are to be repaired the process must begin
early.
The bill is a heartless job, devised to advance
some one's selfish interests under a pretense of phil
anthropic regard for the unfortunate. The amount
of money it will take out of the treasury cannot be
fcretold. No oversight is provided for the opera
tions under it, and it is as open to frauds as was the
coyote scalp bounty law. If the Legislature com
mit the folly of passing it, the Governor will find an
opportunity for his veto to serve at Â©nee the unfor
tunate and defend the taxpayers.
THE CLOSING OF THE GflP.
BY the publication of Mr. Huntington's recent
letter to Edward Ivison of Santa Barbara
concerning the delay in closing tlic gap in the
railroad between Elwood and Suri The Call has lU<
cceded in drawing to it the attention Â«â¢! Mrs, Stanford
and Mr. George Crocker, thereby bringing about an
understanding among the dignitaries oi the Southern
Pacific and what promises to be -i speedy undertaking
of the work.
Neither Mrs. Stanford ooi V. i Crocker was
pleased with the insinuation conveyed in the state
ment of the Huntington tetter: "We have succeeded
in getting Mrs. Stanford and George Crocker to
! agree to go on and' close the K.ip." Each denies any
responsibility for the delay. Mr. Crocker states that
Mrs. Stanford and himself, so far from opposing
' railroad construction, have in the past personally
I obligated themselves for large sums of money for such
: work, and Mrs. Stanford, in an interview with the
New York correspondent of The Call, said: "Kindly
say that I am not an obstructionist. On the con
trary. I am in entire sympathy with the railroad in all
! that it proposes to do for the future development of
I California."
When these statements were repeated to Mr. Hun
tington that gentleman suavely replied: "There has
been a disagreement over this matter. We made the
promise years ago to close the gap, and certainly
should have redeemed that promise before now. While
I have always favored the building of this bit of road
ethers have thought it 'best to defer construction."
The statement thus made was qualified by Mr. Hun
tington in closing the interview by the remark, "We
have not disagreed over the closing of the gap.
There has been only a difference of business judg
ment."
Had the discussion brought out nothing more than
these declarations concerning the responsibility for
past delay, the subject would be of little importance,
notwithstanding its interest. It would have been no
more than a contribution to the history of the inner
councils of the Southern Pacific, and added nothing
to the public knowledge of the intention of the com
pany with respect to the time of beginning the work
on the long desired improvement.
Fortunately it did not end there. In his letter to
Mr. Ivison Mr. Huntington stated the railroad would
probably have the gap closed within a year after the
construction was fairly started, but he did not even
hint at the time when the work would begin. In his
interview with our correspondent in New York he
was more definite, and much more encouraging. He
is quoted as having said: "Recently Mrs. Stanford,
Mr. Crocker, Mr. Hubbard and myself met and con
sidered the advisability of closing the fifty-five mile
gap between the two town?. Mrs. Stanford and Mr.
Crocker gave their consent, and I at once ordered the
construction to proceed. I have given instructions
to push things vigorously, and I am hopeful the work
will be completed within a year."
In some respects this is the most important item of
news that has been given to Californians since the
year opened. It is of the highest value to all the
coast counties between San Francisco and Los An
geles, and indirectly to the State at large. The amount
of road to be laid is small, but the effect will be great,
for it will open a through line for the coast to the
south of us and thus prepare the way for the de
velopment of one of the most favored sections of the
State. Mr. Huntington has at last spoken words
that are truly encouraging, and now let us hope he
will live up to them.
WHO SUPPORTS BURNS?
OUR population is divided comprehensively into
two classes â drones and parasites, who feed on I
the State, and producers, who support it and !
add to its wealth, its power and its character. Dan ;
Burns is the candidate of the first class, who sustain
their laziness and their viciousness indirectly through
the railroad. A few tests, that each legislator can j
quickly apply, will prove this assertion. Has any
horticultural or agricultural community suggested
the election of Dan Burns? Have any miners or man- j
ufacturers, individually or collectively, mentioned him
as their choice? Have any merchants or mercantile I
bodies, bankers, capitalists or property-owners rallied
to his support? Have the schools, the universities, the
churches, any of the moral or intellectual forces of j
the community, manifested their preference for him? i
If all these questions are answered, as they necessarily :
must be. in the negative, what excuse is there for his
candidacy, and, still more, for his election?
Sports, gamblers, lobbyists, unclean politicians of
the lower type, the immoral and degrading pests of
our civilization, all impressed with the railroad brand,
are his impudent and blatant mercenaries. Which
combination do the members of the Legislature
recognize as the public or as composing the Repub
lican party, or as having the interests of the State at
heart? By which do they propose to be governed?
Their answer to these pertinent inquiries is loudly
demanded and will be received before the session
closes.

tion, even to the erection of the tombstones marking

before definite action bo taken.
The Market-street Railway Company
officials have apparently given hoed to
public opinion in the. matter of running its
electric oars down Geary street and ;
thence Into Kearny. They applied yester- |
day fur a franchise over certain down- j

long and car. -fully prepared opinion
signed by the Printing Committee, it was
held that it was illegal to bind them to

which was described by the city Attorney '

of the Fair estate near Black Point.
The Assessor was directed to assess the
franchise and all other property of the
San Francisco and San Mate.) Railway
Company in this city and county for the
fiscal year 1899-1900 in accordance with the
recent opinion of the City and County At

make such representations to the Board
of Epualization and to take such action as !
may preclude it from making any assess

Supervisor Holland arose to a question
of personal privilege. He read an ex

of work which he. as chairman of the
Building Committee, would do. He read
from Mayor Phelan's last message and
showed that his Honor was the first to

DESTRUCTIVE SEA LIONS.
Thousands of Salmon Slaughtered in
the Upper Bay.
Deputy Fish Commissioner John Davis
has Just returned from a trip up the river
and reports that the spring run of salmon
has begun. It is true that these fish
have been ascending the rivers in small
numbers during the winter, but the big
run seems now to have started in. Around
Martinez the fishermen are complaining
loudly of the depredations of the sea lions
in the waters of the upper bay. These
creatures follow the salmon in great num
bers and in one day a good-sized, vigor
ous sea lion will destroy enough fish to
keep a canning factory running for half
that time. Aside from the destruction of
the fish, the fishermen have another rea-
BOU for complaint.
Many of the salmon get into the nets
and there they fall easy victims to the sea
lions. In the rush of these animals the
nets are literally torn to pieces and the
cost of repairing, aside from the loss of
fish, is no small feature in the profit and
loss account of the fishermen. As the sea
llon<* run as far as Sacramento and to
Bouldln Island in the San Joaquin, the net
men are all provided with rifles and shoot
whenever they see their aquatic enemies
fhow their he.ads above the surface of the
water.

REVOLUTIONARY
IDEAS OF THE
REV. DR. GIBSON
Holds His Church Up
to Criticism.
CREATED MARKED SURPRISE
USES THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
FOR COMPARISON.
The Well Known Divine Advocates
an Open Door Policy for Prot
esta-at Institutions and
Less Grumbling.
.Rev. J. George Gibson of Emmanuel
Baptist Church created a mild sensation
yesterday at the weekly meeting of Bap
tist ministers by his criticisms on the
manner in which Protestant churches are
operated, erected and located, as com
pared with Catholic Institutions. He di
vided his usually Interesting paper in six
subdivisions, and each contained sensa
tional Ideas. The title of his paper, "Les
sons From the Catholics," was sufficient
to arouse the Interest of all present, and
its contents startled and amused his
brother ministers. In part he said:
Roman Catholics know how to build
churches. They do not put up shells or bams.
If you see a flimsy Catholic churcn you may
make up your mind It is a mission, to be re
placed In a few years by a splendid buiidine.
Anything may be good enough in wnlch to
make a beginning, but it is always re^aided
as a beginning. If they put up a frame or
patch up an old dwelling It is not ligardea as
a finished church. Some day they intend to
move cut. and amid weeping for vie old ana
Joy for the new, praise God in a splendid tem
ple that will stand to man and weather for
years. I am not raising the question wherÂ»
they get the moneyâ all I say is they show good
sense in building houses that stand tor years
in their strength and majesty.
There 13 a glory in them we do n"t nn<i in
the buildings that beloug to other denomina
tions. On the outside they are majestic and in
side they Inspire silence and devotion.
The speaker then went on to show that
the Catholics know where to build, and in
support of his assertions cited many in
stances where good judgment was shown
in erecting sacred edifices, "for show in
some cases and for work in others."
I Other churches may grumble about their lo
i cations, but not the Catholics. They select th*
! location they want, or wait until they can ge'
'< it. They don't pick a wrong location and then
I grumble. 'If the circumstances change around
I their church they change their church to an
â  swer the circumstances.
They keep open every day. yet the, cost does
not frighten the people away. The poor don t
steal the candles to light up their rooms, nor
does the dude pluck flowers from the altar to
I put them in his button hole.
Dr Gibson then drew a fanciful picture
of the light streaming through the stained
glass windows of a Catholic church and
: the activity within in contradistinction
to the inactivity in the Protestant
i churches.
There is always a sign of life, some token
of enthusiasm that something is going on. The
Protestant church is always closed. The dust

In advocating a wide-open door policy
for his church, the speaker gave a short
description of the Catholic church its
methods and the manner in which Its
i members drop in at all times to pray
' He then took a fling at his colleagues by
' criticizing their wont to live miles away
; from their pastorate. "Catholics always
i know where to find their priests, he said.
"A priest can live in a house without a
bay window and within the sound of ham
mers and the smell of restaurants. Some
men thrive best when they are miles
away from what is known as home cook
'â  ln f he doctor then took up the subject of
assistants, and told how the Catholics
conducted their church and the number
i of priests to carry on its services and
! then pointed out how a minister of the
i Protestant faith had to attend to all his
duties, and if he take an assistant and
' pay him out of his own pocket his con
gregation would call him lazy He cited
S" own case by saying that he had hU
assistant lead in prayer one evening, and
members of his church remarked his ap
parent sloth, whereas he had attended

LOST THIRTY DAYS IN A FOG
BARK WOOLAHAEA'S LONG VOY
AGE ACCOUNTED FOR.
Schooner Charles Hanson Pooped on
the Eureka Bar â Reinsurance
on Two Overdue Ships
Jumping.
The American ship M. P. Grace and the.
British bark Brussels have just com
': pl-eted two of the longest voyages, that
have been made between Australia and
' San Francisco In year?. Neither vessel
.. sighted the other during the run and yet
It would stem as though each captain
.was trying to be the last in. They sail
d within a day of each other, crossed the
equator the same day. 62 degrees of longi
tude apart and reached San Francisco
within forty-eight hours of each other.
Strange to say, the American ship en
countered nothing but light winds and
calms, while the British bark had "dirty
weather" nearly all the way and lost her
Jibboom In a squall.
The M. P. Grace left Sydney, N. S. W.,
on November 21 last. No southeast trade
winds wore picked up end the vessel
drifted nearly all the way to the equator,
â  which was crossed in 120 west longitude.
From the equator to port the Grace en
countered nothing but light winds and
â¢ calms.
The Brussels left Newcastle, N. S. TV.,
on November 20 last, and after getting off
shore had continuously dirty weather
; from the north and northeast to
latitude 5 south. The equator was cross- i
ed in 172 west longitude and ten days later |
â a squall struck the vessel, carrying away I
a number of sails, jibboom and fore top- !
gallant mast. The trade winds were lost i
in 19 north, after which the bark hud
nothing but light winds, accompanied by 'â¢
â¢â¢a. heavy cross sea. which made every one
of the crew long for port.
The Grace and Brussels were to long i
out that reinsurance was paid on both
of them. It was not heavy enough to i
tempt the gamblers, however.
The British bark woolahara, which ar- â¢
rived at Eureka the other day, gave her !
â  owners and agents a great scare. She
was forty-rive days out from Honolulu In
ballast and the insurance men were get
ting to wonder what had become of her. :
â After leaving Honolulu the bark made
. splendid time and in ten days was 400
â  miles- off Eureka. Then unusually heavy
weather was run into and the "Wo'olahara
was i riven back. She made the coast
again in a fog an.d for a month was off
the Eureka bar. Once or twice she tried
to- cross in. but had to stand out to sea ,
;again. Several times she heard the tugs !
.. whistle, but could net make herself heard '
.mi the fog. Finally the weather .beared j
,un. the bark was seen and towed into i
port. She will load 750.000 feet of lumber
for Sydney, X. S. W.
The schooner Charles Hanson, which
; left here over a week ago for Eureka,
had a hard time of it crossing in over the
Humboldt River bar. While being towed
in a big sea broke aboard, half killing two
â¢ of the crew and carrying away the taff
ra:l. The men were washed down the ;
companion way and had several bones I
broken. The cabin was flooded and the
cabin boy. who was laying the table for
di-nner. was half drowned. The Hanson
will load lumber for Hawaii.
Reinsurance on the British bark Carnar
von Hay and ship Alcides is going up '
â wrth leaps. The Carnarvon Bay is out
171 days from Tacoma for Queenstown !
and last Saturday 30 per cent reinsurance !
-was paid. Yesterday 30 per cent was of
iVred and no takers. The Alcides, one of
the fastest vessels in the grain trade â 
is. out HI days from San Francisco for i
London, and Saturday 20 per cent rein- j
surance was paid on her. Yesterday 30
.per cent was offered and to-day it "will 1
probably be still higher. The Carnarvon ;
Bay is loaded with 70.355 centals of wheat |
valued at $71,000. and the Alcides with j
â¢â¢30, 15? centals of barley, valued at $44,000,
besides a general cargo.

HOW THE RACES
WERE RUN AT
COUGHS TRACK
Three of the Choices
in Front.
CALDWELL IN FORM AGAIN
LEFT EL SAX ADO AT THE
POST.
Tyro the Subject of a Presentation.
The Conditions Suited Him.
Survivor Downed Adolph
Spreckels.
Thfl Corrigan track furnished some
freckled-looking sport to a mild collection
of racegoers at Ingleslde yesterday. As
though the local populace could not get
along without them, a hurdle affair was
placed on the programme. Needless to
remark, it served as the means for Ed
Corrigan to add to his already badly
swollen list of winnings. Seventeen
bookmakers cut in, and there was busi
ness enough for about half that number.
Three favorites strutted past the wire in
front.
About the grandest piece of barrier
work Mr. Caldwell has performed in some
time he reserved for reopening day. In
the five-furlong dash, fourth on the card.
Corrigan started Maxello and It was to
have oeen the "great big thing" of the
afternoon. The Maxim horse closed
equal favorite with El Salado. The lat
ter, with Piggott up. coijld have won
hands down, but unfortunately in his de
sire to get Maxello away, Caldwell left
El SaUdo at the post. If ever anything
looked deliberate, this did. Piggott was
ordered to take his mount back, and
while facing the reverse way, was left, to
gether with February, another dangerous
one. As it turned out, Maxello was not
among the first three. Don Luis, a 20 to 1
shot, led Al out over a length. To make
the play forcible. Piggott was suspended
by the starter for the balance of the
week.
The capture of the mile and a quarter
hurdle race was a ridiculous piece of
work made more absurd by its crudity.
Tyro, the Corrigan entry, was allowed to
win by himself. The gelding might havo
been pounds the best, but others took no
chances.
A field of ten two-year-olds lined up in
the opening three and a half furlong
scramble. At post time W. L. Stantield"s
Apache filly, Kitty Kelly, had a slight
call in the betting, and though she made
a handsome showing, was beaten out a
head by Morbid, the entry of Walter Jen
nings, ridden by Spencer. The winner
opened a 2 to 1 favorite, receding later to
7to 2. Montebank finished in the show.
Garnet Ferguson's recent purchase.
Dare 11. closed favorite for the mile ami
a sixteenth, but took no part of the
money. Eddie Jone* hustled old Tom
Cromwell out the first part, killing the
favorite off. In the run home Cromwell
had it all his own way, winning easily
KICKED TO DEATH
A CHINESE GIRL
ACftINAMAN giving the name of
Loui Lung was arrested yesterday
afternoon by" Detectives Gibson.
Wren and BCcMahon on suspicion of
being the highbinder who murdered the
slave girl. Quey Yong, two weeks ago.
Investigation last night proved that the
man under arrest was not the guilty one
! and to-day the detectives, who acknowl
i edge their trror, will have the prisoner
! released.
The man who murdered the girl is Loui
i Leong, and he has been in hiding ever
' since he learned that the girl's injuries
\ would prove fatal. After her death he
i attempted to compromise with the girl's
! owner, another highbinder, but the price
i offered was not half tW Rirl'a cost, which
i was $1500, and the owTer, disgusted at
from Gotobed. The winner was 5 to 1 in
1 Thermite selling run went to Pat
Dunne's useful performer Survivor,.sec
ond choice in the betting. The Comgan
entry, Adolph Bpreckete, was backed down
to 9 to 10 favoritism. After Rey del
Tierra had played himself out, setting a
merry pace for his neld, Devin moved up
with Survivor, winning easily in 1:41 ] 4.
Martin, astride Spreckels, made a move
the last few yards, securing the place.
In the concluding mile and a furlong run
Merops, the favorite, galloped in an easy
winuer over Sardonic.

The New York Commercial says:
"The effects of the cold wave upon all de

coming felt more and more every day. They
are chiefly noticeable In the continued scarcity
and bad condition in which a great part or j
the vegetables reach the distributors here.
â¢There has been a scarcity of early peas,
eggplants cabbage, tomatoes and strawberries,
nor do the later reports of the damage done in
the more northerly section of the South indi
cate that these conditions will improve. Grow
ing crops that had not reached maturity before
the cold wave struck them have been ruined
either completely or partially. special bulletin
â â¢In Georgia, according to a special bulletin
compiled from reports of several hundred cor
respondents scattered throughout the State the
damage will amount to millions of dollars
Peaches in the lower counties were heavily
damaged and other fruits suffered conspicuous
>: 'In South Carolina and North Carolina the
damage to immature vegetables was very se
vere and produce dealers here believe that
most crops will be very short and that prices
will rule higher on early produce than has been
the cape for several years."

here. Speculation was purely professional and
much was made of the firmness of money,
which at one time touched ZVi per cent for call
loans, at which price it closed. The "best au
thorities" were quoted as turning the money
flurry as only a flash in the pan. The Im
provement in the demand for money In the
dry goods and other lines of trade, together :
with the preparations to finance the Central
Pacific settlement with the Government, the
Chicago and Alton deal and some Industrial
combinations, were responsible for . the im
proved tone. It was argued that a sustained
advance from current rate 3 would be fol
lowed by gold imports, but It was pointed out
that many Interior banks have supplies of
money above their previous records. Of the
g-old on the way from the Pacific Coast, which

vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The markets here were inactive and dull on
the eve of the settlement beginning to-morrow.
Americans opened firm above parity, to the
surprise of many onlookers, but gradually
j weakened. There was a small rally on New
! York buying of coalers, assisted by a private
cable dispatch to the effect that the anthracite
coal deal was arranged, but later New York
sold freely, causing a very flat close.
London fears money troubles over some of
I the recently established trusts, but has no
| commitment, long or short.
Spanish 4s touched 66%. and closed 55%.
Copper was a pound down. The shares are
heavy. Tintos were 3*4, and closed 3v,Â»- Utahs
and Bostons were practically unsalable at 7%@

THE STOCK MARKET.
On the morning session of the Bond Ex
change the loading fluctuation was an ad
vance in Mutual Electric to $16. Business was
good. Afternoon quotations were unchanged.
Mining stocks opened lower, owing to the
continued delay In the pumping operations.
The telegram from the pump read as follows:
"Water twenty-nine feet four inches below
1750-foot level. The pump will not be started
until some time Wednesday, as the Risdon
people wish to be present. They will arrive
to-morrow." The weekly report appears be
low.
In the afternoon the feeling was firmer and
prices advanced to a point generally above the
best figures of Saturday.

The official report of General Manager Ross
of the Comstock Pumping Association for the
past week Is as follows:
During the past week pumping at the C.
and C. shaft has been interrupted twice by de
fective discharge pipeâ tapered section, ten
feet long, made of '4-lnch steel, riveted and
connected to the elevator and the 14-lnch dis
charge pipe with heavy cast-Iron flanges, the
steel of which was probably injured in roll
ing. This broken section is to be replaced
with a 4-foot section of phosphor-bronze, that
will be connected directly with the seamless
discharge column. The water has been low
â¢<Ted fifty-three feet below the 1750 level sta
tion, or eighty-one feet below the discharge,
leading to the Sutro tunnel. The only place
where the action of the pumps can be noted
in the adjoining mines at present is at the
'"hollar combination shaft. At this point we
find a slight lowering of the water, It having
fallen ten inches since we started pump
ing at the C. and C. shaft. The Chollar com
bination shaft is located 3300 feet south and
1000 feet east of the C. and C: shaft. The
slight fall of ten Inches is rather a small
matter to call attention to. but as the meas
urements were carefully made there Is no
doubt but in continuing the pumping at the
C. and C. shaft we will drain a large section
of the Comstock lode.
We expect to replace the. defective pipe with
the phosphor-bronze section in a few days.
We have cleaned out, retimbered and laid
track in the 1400-foot level drift a distance of
seventy-two feet on account of the Consolidat
ed California and Virginia Mining Company.
During the week we have completed 500 feet
of the Osblston shaft connection to accom
modate the Sutro tunnel cars, on account of
the Gould & Cury and Best & Belcher mining
CO For aT and on account of the Savage Mining
Company we continue cleaning out their con
necting drift with the main Sutro tunnel. As
mentioned last week, this work is done for
the purpose of enabling them to catch up
and convey such water as is now flowing Into
the lower levels to the tunnel drain boxes.
The report from the Consolidated California
and Virginia mine for the past week states
that the C. and C. shaft for fifty feet below
the 1750 level has been cleaned out and re
paired and the pump rod column, piping ana
Stays have been taken out of the pump com
partment. From the 1750 level down this com
partment will be repaired so that the pump
cage can be used for all work on the pump-
Ing plant after it has been installed, as dur
ing the installation they have to use the cen
ter hoist compartment. On the 1400 level the
drift has been cleaned out and retimbered and
track laid for a total distance of 264. feet.
Work has been resumed on the 1750 station
and has been continued on the electric In
-8I n the Ophlr mine during the past week
the old workings cut into by the north drift
on the Central tunnel level were examined
and the quartz vein they had been following
was found to make a sharp turn to the east
and that it had been followed by a drift on
the hanging wall side for 150 feet, where the
"drift had been filled. At the point of recent
connection there Is a west drift extending 200
feet into the footwall. They are now pre
paring to Vun three crosscuts into the foot
wall at distances of fifty feet apart On the
Sutro tunnel level connection work has been
started and the drift from the north lateral
has been advanced five feet.
In the Sierra Nevada mine the northwest
drift on the 140-foot level was advanced last
week thirty-five feet; total length 165 feet.
The face is In porphyry and quartz. The south
drift from the top of the upraise eighty feet
above the 900 level Is out ninety-three feet.
The face is in clay and porphyry.

Not Concerned Over
Her Trial.
PRETTY AND WELL DRESSED
BUT IT LOOKS AS THOUGH SHE
POISONED HER HUSBAND.
Testimony Introduced That Puts ths
Duped Scenic Artist in a
Most Unpleasant
Light.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, March 6.â Mme. Charles Bi
anchini. wife of the famous and popu
lar scenic artist, arrested last Novem
â¢! the charge of attempting to
poison him. was placed on trial to-day.
The courtroom was crowded with fash
ionable women, many prominent peo
ple being present.
Tlio prisoner, who was elegantly at
tired, conducted herself In Die most
nonchalant fashion and flatly denied
the accusation. The evidence showed
that, after squadermg his wife's for
tune of 750,000 francs, M. Bianchini, in
order to prevent his home being sold,
allowed M. Mayer, a well-known theat
rical critic, to become his wife's lover.
M. Mayer took his meals at the house
and practically lived th
When the parties were trying to ar
range a divorce M. Bianchini used to
be found in the mornjng with the pu
pils of his eyes terribly dilated, his face
black, venous blotches on his chest and
his limbs quivering. He generally re
covered toward evening.
One peculiarity of the case which
presents many mysteries is that M.
Bianchini still declares that he does nut
believe his wife guilty.
About six months before Mme. Bian
chini's arrest her husband was sud
denly attacked by a mysterious malady
which the physicians diagnosed differ
ently. One of them declared his belief
that the symptoms were those of atrb
plne poisoning, and thereupon Bian
chini's friends, Messrs. Carr and (Jail
hard, directors of the Grand Opera,
took it upon themselves to carry him to
;a distant village away from his wife.
There he recovered rapidly. When the
police arrested Mme. Bianchini they
found bottles of atropine in the house.
She is said to be a very pretty woman
nnd to have taken the arrest and all the
subsequent proceedings flippantly.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SEATTLE, March 6.â A special from
Spokane reports that Archie Brown, a
former musician of the Frank Daniels
Company, created a sensation in that
city to-day by escaping from a pest
house, where he had been imprisoned
because of being afflicted with small
pox. Later, finding himself on crowded
thoroughfares, he was taken for a fugi
tive criminal and chased by. a mob
composed of hundreds of people.
The Daniels company played at Spo
kane last week. Brown became ill on
Saturday and developed a genuine case
of smallpox. IJe became delirious yes
terday, broke out of the pesthouse, and.
boarding a crowded car, rode to the city.
The conductor believing Brown to be
crazy telephoned to the police, who
went in search of the afflicted man.
In the meantime Brown had left the
car, rushed up and down the crowded
streets, made himself troublesome in a
half dozen big stores, scared women
and children, and when found by the
poliro wa^: surrounded by hundreds of
people, who believed him to be a crim
inal.
Brown had made several efforts to
escape, but each time the crowd had
grabbed him and felled him to the
street. Then a physician arrived and
pronounced thp man a victim of small
pox and the hundreds of people scat
tered in every direction, each satisfied
that he could discover germs of the
disease on. his person.
The Health Officer advised a general
vaccination, but it was .found that the
pupply of vaccine points was limited;
Coast cities were immediately wired to
for a supply. A general scare prevails
to-night at Spokane, but there is be
lieved to be little danger of the pest
spreading.
UNION SAVINGS BANK
DIRECTORS TO RESIGN
Agreement Reached After a Confer
ence With Attorney Gen
eral Ford.
SAN JOSE, March 6.â The new board of
directors of the wrecked Union Savings
Bank to-night, by a vote of 4 to 3, decided
to resign in a body.
Attorney General Ford, Deputy G. A.
Sturtevant and Bank Commissioner Bar
rett came down this afternoon to meet
the directors. The Attorney General ad
vised that all the directors resign, as they
had no legal Standing now and had no
right to elect members since the failure.
This suggestion met the approval of Di
rectors Wright, Eaton, Jones and Cal
lisch. James W. Rea and C. P. Braslan
opposed it and Director Bowdcn refused
to vote.
To-morrow Attorney General Ford will
file a supplemental complaint in the suit
recently brought to have the bank de
clared insolvent. In this he will aver the
directors have all resigned and ask the
court to fill vacancies in the directory.
This will be answered by the board ad
mitting the fact. Then the appointment
of directors will come. A long list of
namesâ among them those of all the old
and new directors â will be submitted to
Judge Lorigan for selection. The stock
holders and depositors will again take a
hand and try to obtain recognition. They
will oppose the appointment of any of the
old directors, on the ground that bank
wreckers should not be allowed to handle
a bank's business.
As yet no real work In the settlement
of the bank's affairs has commenced, and
the depositors are growing restless. They
will meet on Thursday, and it' is said
steps will be taken then to rush a settle
ment.

MINORITY SUBMITS A DISSENT

Declares That the Senatorial Candi
date Did Seek to Obtain
Votes by the Use of
Money.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, March 6.â The Legis
lative Investigating Committee sub
mitted a majority and minority report
to the joint assembly this afternoon.
The majority report is signed by Sena
tor Whitney and Representatives Stew
art, Mansfield, Sorensen and Cura
mings. The minority report is signed
by Senators Shurtliff and Howells. The
llndings of the- majority report are as
follows:
1. In the matter of the charge of brib
ery preferred by Representative Law
against A. \\". McCune we Jind, after the
careful consideration, that the
charge is not sustained by the evidence.
2. In the Sloan-Nebeker case we find
that the said ft. AY. Sloan improperly ap
proached Senator W. G. NVbeker for the
purpose of securing his (Nebeker's) sup
port for Mr. McCune, but the evidence
oot establish an attempted bribery
or other public offense.
3. In the I vms- Jackson case the evi
dence is not sufficient to justify the con
clusion that any attempt was made to
secure by improper means Mr. Jackson'a
vote. We believe that in this case Mr.
Ja^-ks^n labored under an honest but mis
taken impression.
4. The evidence in the Cook-Farr mat
ter Is so remote that we deem it irrele
vant to any issue under consideration.
The Lapish charge â a supplemental case
âIs one in which the evidence bearing
upon the statement made is not sufficient
to warrant the finding of an attempted
bribery or other public offense.
In conclusion, we record our emphattc
disapproval of the present method of con
ducting Senatorial campaigns, particular
ly the practice by Senatorial candidates
of opening headquarters, employing num
erous assistants and entertaining by
means of free dinners, free theaters and
other gratuitous dispensations, persons
whose votes are desired by me candidates
at whose expense those things are pro
vided. It not only tends to evil, but it
works evil and In the interest of good
government, pure elections and that
higher political morality which all good
citizens desire to see attained, the prac
tice should be abolished. We -also con
demn the circulation of unfounded ru
mors designed to injure the prospects of
Senatorial candidates.
The specific finding in the minority
report is that A. W. McCune did, by
the use of money, attempt to secure the
vote of Albert A. Law, and that R. W.
Sloan sought by improper means to se
cure the vote of State Senator W. G.
Nebeker for Mr. McCune for United
States Senator.
After the reading of the reports the
joint aster bly adjourned until 9:30 to
morrow morning, when the reports will
be taken up for discussion.

HITT TALKS OF
LAWS IN HAWAII
Resultof Congress' Fail
ure to Act,
SITUATION NOT HOPELESS
EMBARRASSMENTS, HOWEVER,
ARE LIKELY TO ARISE.
One Great Source of Difficulty Will
Be the Failure to Properly
Determine Admiralty
Questions.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
WASHINGTON, March 6.
There has been considerable specula
tion as to the effect upon the conditions
In the Hawaiian Islands owing to the
failure of Congress to enact the legis
lation demanded.
Representative Hitt of Illinois, chair
man of the Committee on Foreign Af
fairs In the last Congress, who was one
of the Hawaiian commissioners, is
probably as conversant with Hawaiian
affairs as any public man in Washing
ton. Mr. Hitt was asked to-day for an
expression of opinion upon what may
be expected in Hawaii between this
time and the reassembling of Congress
â¢and the enactment of proper laws.
"I am by no means inclined to take a
hopeless view of the situation," said
Mr. Hitt. "It Is true that embarrass
ments will arise. For instance,, a strict
construction of the existing law, or
rather absence of law, would permit
criminals to go free because of the con
flict between the United States laws
and local regulations. But it is not to
be considered that any such construc
tion will be placed upon the case. The
courts will see to it that public order
is conserved.
"Another great source of difficulty
will be in the determination of admiral
ty questions. As a matter of fact, they
will not be determined, but the people
will have to worry along as best they
can. As for customs questions, I think
the President will have sufficient pow
er, in the absence of specific legislation,
to settle them.
"I believe that when the next Con
gress convenes it will be possible to se
cure consideration for the Hawaiian
bill and to enact a comprehensive law
for the islands. In the meantime, the
ability and integrity of the men in
charge of the government will be a suf
ficient safeguard for the interests of the
people." .

ADVEBTISEMENTS. , .
AN EXCELLENT COMBINATION.
The pleasant method and beneficial
effects of the " well-known remedy.
Syrup of Figs, manufactured by the
California Fig: -Syrup Company, illus-
trates the value of obtaining the liquid
laxative principles of plants known to
be medicinally laxative and presenting
them in the form most refreshing to
the taste and acceptable to the. system.
It is the one perfect strengthening lax-
ative, cleansing the system effectually,
dispelling colds, headaches and fevers
gently yet promptly, a.nd enabling one
to overcome habitual constipation per-
manently. Its perfect freedom from
every objectionable quality and sub-
stance and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, without weakening
or. irritating them, make it the. Ideal
laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs
are used, as they are pleasant to the
taste, but the medicinal qualities of the
remedy are obtained from senna and
other aromatic plants by a method
known to the California Fig Syrup
Company only. In order to get its ben-
eficial effects and to avoid imitations,
please remember the full name of the
company, printed on the front of every

YOUNG WIFE
SEEKS DEATH
WITH POISON
Manimco Jealous of
His Friend.
HE RETURNED IN A HURRY
FOUND HIS WIFE CALLING ON A
BOOMER.
to Kill Her, but Dropped
thÂ« Knife When She De
clared That She Wm
Innocent.
Oakland ' Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March. 6.
IClttte 'Manimco wants to die. Her hus
band is jealous of her, and this morning i
took up a knife, threatening to end their j
troubles. The little woman protested her j
Innocence, dared him to strike and he I
threw away the knife. Then she went
home, swallowed half an ounce of sul
phate of zinc and tried to die.
The cause of all the Manimco troubles is |
a mutual friend of the family, Vincent !
Margio, who visited the couple last night
and was invited to stay until morning.'
Early this morning Manimco left his j
home In the Rosalie House and went to :
Jus restaurant in the Sj.. Lawrence House, i
About half an hour later he suddenly re
turned. His own rooms were vacant, and
he heard his wife talking to Margio in
another room. He reached all sorts of |
conclusions, and at once determined that j
eomebody must die.
"I really want to die," said Mrs.
Manimco. who is about 25 years old, "be
cause my husband is unreasonably Jealous !
end accuses me of all sorts of things
without cause. This morning when be
went out 1 got up and dressed and went
to the room Margio occupied. I was talk- j
Ing to him when my husband returned. I
He at once suspected that I was unfaith
ful to him, and without giving me an op- j
potunlty to say a word he went back to
the restaurant. I followed him, and when
I got there he seized me roughly, and, |
raising" a butcher knife, he swore he j
would kill me. I said, "Kill me; I am â 
lnnocenx. " and then he dropped the knife. I
I returned to my room and swallowed the j
poison. 1 felt so bad I wanted my little i
daughter to take some, but she ran down- ;
etairs and told my husband that I had j
taken poison. He tame up. and I was so j
anxious to die that 1 denied taking any I
poison and he believed me and went ,
away. Shortly afterward my daughter
found me on the floor, and then ran for j
eman, who took me to the hospital, j
â¢ been married to Manimco but three !
months, and was a widow when I met
Mrs. Manimco was attended to promptly '
will not die unless she takes more j
poison. Her husband says that a divorce j
only thing that will satisfy him. i
Altogether it wus an unlucky day in the j
restaurant, for while Manimco was up
braiding his wife his chief cook, James F. i
Lane, fell heavily and fractured his thigh,
and he was also taken to the hospital.
It is f.'ared a tragedy will result lrom
the quarrel between Manimco, Margio and
the former's wife, for the Italian colony
has taken a general interest in it, as the
restaurant man is a leading spirit among
his couhtrymen.

A SECBET MABBIAGE.
Lulu Homeier Only Announced Her
Wedding After Long Delay.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, March 6. ;j
Miss Lulu Homeier, youngest daughter
of Louis Homeier, the well-known musi
cian, formerly leader of the Baldwin The
ater orchestra, stated to-day that she had
been secretly married October 24, 1897, to
George C. Shane of 2714 Sutter street, San
j Francisco. Immediately after divulging
I her secret the young lady disappeared
and her parents are ignorant of her
' â whereabouts.
f Mrs. HomJtler, the girl's mother, stated
this evening that she knew nothing about
the marriage and was apparently pained
at the strange actions of her daughter.
"Lulu left home Saturday night." said
Mrs. Homeier, "stating that she had se
cured employment at 564 Tenth street,
Oakland. I have not seen her since. The
announcement of her wedding is news to
me and I can hardly believe that it is
true." â¢
According to the story told by Miss Ho
meier she was married in San Rafael Oc
tober 24, 1897. by a Rev. Mr. Dodge. Imme
diately after the ceremony the bride re
turned to her home in this city and kept
her secret for nearly a year and a half.
Her husband, who is employed as a book
' keeper, returned to his duties. Since then,
it is stated he has been a regular visit
or at the Homeier home, but neither of
the young folks gave the slightest inti
mation that they were married. Miss Ho
meier said the reason for keeping the
marriage a secret, was the fear of paren
tal wrath.
A week after the San Rafael ceremony
Mr. and Mrs. Shane attended a reception
given in Alameda by Dr. Alfred Sander,
who figured prominently in the Roebke-
Green /engagement. For more than two
years previous Miss Homeier and Dr.
Sander had been fast friends and it was
currently reported that they were en
gaged. .
Since the story of the young lady's mar
riage became. public many of her friends
called to mind that she had told them
early in 1898 that she was married, but in
view of the rumor connecting her name
â with that of Dr. Sander they considered
her statements as a joke, hut as they say
in the books, it is no joke when people
really get married.

THE HAND OF
THE LAW ON
COLLECTOR PECK
Santa Cruz Ex-Offi
cial in Trouble.
HE IS CHARGED WITH FELONY
BAID TO HAVE EMBEZZLED PUB
LIC FUNDS.
He Says He Resigned His Office Last
August, Is Innocent and
a Victim of His
Enemies,
ALAMEDA, March 6.â W. E. Peck, ex-
Tax and License Collector for Santa Cruz
County, was arrested here to-night on
warrants charging him with felony em-
bezzlement. The charges are the out
growth of his dealings with Santa Cruz
County and are based on indictments
found by the Grand Jury. Although he
was arrested early in the evening, the
police did everything possible to keep the
matter a secret. Peck has been on a
spree and stopping at a Park street lodg
ing house in company with a woman.
Immediately after Peck was taken into
custody the woman disappeared, and if
the police know anything of her identity
they will not acknowledge it. Peck was
eating his dinner in a local restaurant
in company with his female companion
when Marshal Conrad served the warrant
of arrest.
When Peck was seen in the tanks to
night he said he would not have been in
Alameda if he had not been taken sick
while coming through here on the narrow
gauge train from Saji Jose to San Fran
cisco en route to Santa Cruz, where he
proposed to go to face his accusers. He
would not state why he had not gone di
rectly home from San Jose, that being
the shortest route.
"I am Innocent of any wrong, said the
prisoner, "and the report of the county
expert will show that my accounts were
straight. I resigned my office last August
and remained In Santa Cruz until two
months ago. when I went to Tulare
County on a mining expedition. A\ hile
I was away the Supervisors, who had it in
for me, managed to get the Grand Jury
to indict me on some purely technical
charges. That is all there is to the mat
ter lam not Indebted to Santa Cru*
County one cent and will willingly po
back to face my accusers. The woman I
was with at the time I was arrested is
an Alamedan, but I refuse to give her
name." _ â¢ â¢ _ ...
The Sheriff of Santa Cruz County will
take Peck home to-morrow.
DR. WOOLSEY'S ALLEGATIONS
CONSIDERED UNFOUNDED
HIS OWN EXPERT PROVES HIM
TO BE IN ERROR.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
â¢ 908 Broadway, March 6.
E. R. Jackson, the artist and photog
rapher who furnished District Attorney
Allen with the photographs of the dead
Lillian Brandes showing minutely every
bruise, mark and discoloration on her
body, was vindicated this afternoon, and
that by F. A. Webster, another photog
rapher, whom Dr. E. H. Woolsey had
called in as an expert.
The allegations made by Dr. Woolsey,
chief expert for the defense in the
Brandes murder trial, to the effect that
the photographs or negatives had been
tampered with, or "doctored," were clear
ly proved to be unfounded, and the pride
of the aged doctor In his self-confidence
and infallibility for accuracy and correct
ness sustained a severe jolt.
.Mr. Webster very carefully scrutinized
the negatives and compared them with
the photographs. When he had concluded
his work he stated that he was unable to
find a blemish or foreign mark on the
negatives, also that the photographs were
good prints from the negatives.
Dr Woolsey was apparent4y not pleased
with the result, and moved to leave the
room but Mr. Jackson intercepted.
"Dr. Woolsey," said the young artist,
"before you go I want you to understand
that your expert, Mr. Webster, has seen
and examined this entire lot of negativ.-s.
a~d has found no blemishes or spots other
than those that should be there. You un
derstand he says that the photos are good
prints from the negatives?"
"Well, that's goodâ that's good. re
plied Dr. Woolsey, his cheeks flushed with
a sort of what of it blush. "In fact I did
not absolutely claim they were 'doctored.
I guess you exploited that fact in the pa
pers yourself." .
But Artist Jackson would not down and
close "You told me yourself, in the
presence of reporters and witnesses, that
these pictures and negatives were 'doc
tored.' I guess you have forgotten all you
The murder trial will be resumed to
morrow and there is little doubt that the
correctness of the pictures will again be
questioned. Dr. Crowley or Dr. Pratt
will probably be the first witness called
on the part of the defense.
TANNERY IN OAKLAND
BURNED TO THE GROUND
HEAVY LOSS TO J. S. DEBBY &
SONS.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway. March 6.
The largre tannery of J. S. Derby & Sons
on East Twelfth street, near Eighteenth
avenue, was completely destroyed by fire
at about 6 o'clock this morning. The ftrra
estimates the total loss on stock. Includ
ing 2000 hides, and plant at $16,000, cov
ered by an insurance of $4000.
The blaze was first discovered by H. H.
Lewis, residing at 1126^ East Fourteenth
street, and he turned in the alarm. When
the fire. apparatus arrived there was .left
but little hope of saving the building, and
most of the Fire Departments attention
was directed with effect to saving the
tannery of Brown & Adams, situated di- j
rectly east of the blaze. A cottage just |
opposite the burning building was
scorched considerably, but was saved by
the chemical engines.
The cause of the fire is thus far un
known There was no one about the place
at the time so far as known, and there
had been no fire in the'furnaces since last
Friday. It is believed, however, that
tramps unintentionally set the place on
fire. , , Â _ ,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, MARCH 7, 1899.
CANNOT USE HIS
GOOD RIGHT ARM
Fitzsimmons Crippled
Temporarily.
WARNED BY HIS PHYSICIANS
TOLD HE MUST NOT FIGHT, BUT
BEFUSES TO OBEY.
The Champion's Elbow Injured by a
Blow Delivered by Kenney,
His Big Sparring
Partner.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March 6.â Something is
radically wrong with Robert Fitzsim
mons' right elbow. He cannot Btraight
en his mighty right arm, and when
anybody touches him on the "funny
| bone" the champion groans in agony.
i Two doctors examined Fitzsimmons to
i day, and with the aid of an "X-ray"
made a careful study of the injured
elbow. They told him he needed abso
lute rest for at least two months and
â  warned him against engaging in any
j pugilistic encounters for some time.
When Fitzsimmons heard the verdict
of the medical men he simply said:
"This won't stop me from fighting
I 'Jim' Jeffries. I will go into the ring
i with him if I have only one good hand,
! and I'll win out at that."
I According to Drs. McNamara and
j Sincere the pugilist is suffering from a
i "displacement," or chipping-off of the
i tip of the olecranon process. When
: asked how he hurt it Fitzsimmons said:
"About four months ago I was box
j ing with my sparring partner, big
; 'Yank' Kenney. In blocking one of his
I heavy swings I caught the full force of
I the blow on the point of the right el
bow. It was a funny place to get it.
; but my arm dropped like a shot and
i the pain was something awful. I tried
massages and liniments, and after a
time managed to get the swelling down,
but I haven't been able to straighten
my arm since the accident. When I
try to do it the pain drives me frantic."
It was found a sliver had been
chipped from the bone, which causes an
irritation and constant inflammation of
the muscles.
Class Bush Barely Averted.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 6.â
The sophomore class baseball team to-day
won the second victory by defeating the
freshman nine. The score was 12 to 7.
The sophs will next come up against the
junior team, when the interclass cham
pionship will be decided.
Something of the old-time spirit which
existed in the class organizations before
the rule against rushing was passed was
exhibited by tfie enthusiasts of the root
ing section. Indeed, a mix up occurred
which looked for a time as if it would end
in one of the prohibited rushes. It was
stopped by some cool-headed sophomores,
who realized the consequences of a
mix up.

BUDDE WAS INSANE.
Groundless Bumor That He Was
"Bailroaded" to an Asylum.
STOCKTON, March 6.â The asylum au
thorities here place no credence in the
charges being made in San Francisco that
Merchant Rudde was railroaded into the
j madhouse. They say he was Insane,
i but that he must have had poor care in
! the way of nursing. Dr. Hersholt, who
had charge of Rudde, said to-day:
"The man was registered as 'Rudee'
here. He was insane. He continually
thought he was being persecuted. He was
also delirious. He had two large bed sores
when he came here. This was the fault
of the nurse in the hospital Rudee was
in at San Francisco. I a/lvised his rela
tives who visited him here that he was
â¢ going to die, and telephoned to them
I when he died on Friday. They came up
and got the body the following day, I
think the fight lies between the relatives
on Rudee's side and the relatives on the
side of his wife."

BROKE DOWN.
Lieutenant Munson of the Ninth In
fantry Tells How His Men.
Suffered for Lack of
Nourishment.
Special IMepatch to Tha Cail.
WASHINGTON, March 6.â The War
Department Court of Inquiry held a
very brief session to-day, the last be
fore its start for the West, where the
members will inspect the packing
plants of Chicago, Omaha and Kansas
City. There was but one witness ex
amined. Lieutenant Frederick L. Mun
son of the Ninth Infantry. He said that
during his service in Cuba, up to the
surrender of Santiago, his command
had as a meat component of the ration,
bacon and canned roast beef in the pro
portion of about ten days of the former
to fifteen days of the latter. Until the
surrender he received no complaints of
the canned roast beef, but after the
surrender hhs commissary sergeant re
ported to. him that something was mak
ing- the men very sick. They did not
know what it was, but thought it was
something they had eaten. After
eliminating every other fact that they
could think of, they concluded it must
be the canned roast beef.
He ordered the cooks to try fixing up
the meat in stews with hardtack and
tomatoes, but it seemed to make no dif
ference. The men continued sick, and
they then stopped the use of the beef.
On the voyage home they still had
canned roast beef, but the men did not
eat it. He tried to turn it In to the
commissary at Montauk, but the com
missary would not receive it.
"Did you make any report on this?"
asked Colonel Davis.
"No, sir."
"Did it not occur to you that it was
your duty to your command to report
this state of things?" continued Col
onel Davis, rather severely.
"As it appears to me now," said the
witness, very frankly, "I may have
been negligent, but at the time the com
plaint was so general, and there being
absolutely no chance of bettering the
situation, I did not make any formal
report on It."
As to the' refrigerator beef, witness
said the principal objection to it was
that it spoiled before the men received
it. He was obliged to condemn his
whole consignment of refrigerator beef
three times.
The health of the men remained good
until about two weeks before leaving,
when the command broke down all in
a bunch. His command was the head
quarters provost guard, made up of old
and picked men. They were not tne
sort to complain of anything until they
had reached the very limit of endur
ance. Their sickness was almost en
tirely bowel and stomach trouble.
This wound up the taking of testi
mony in Washington and the court ad
journed to meet in Chicago on Thurs
day. ______ââ_

WAR DECLARED UPON
THE NEW PRIMARY LAW
Important Course of Action Decided Upon Yesterday by
the County Central Committee of the
Non=Partisans.
Will Contest the Enactment in the Courts if There Are
Flaws in It â Fear Boss Control of the
Primaries if the Law Becomes
Operative.
IF there is a single flaw in the primary
election law signed by the Governor
Saturday that can be detected by the
â¢ legal talent available In this city,
the validity of that enactment will be con
. by the local Non-Partisan organiza
tion. This course was decided upon yes
terday at a special meeting of the county
committee of that body, presided over by
Chairman George K. Pitch, and held in
the office of I. T. Milliken. There were
present at this meeting L. Altsehul, C. C.
Burr. (ie.T^e L. ("enter, W. 11. Crim,

ken, John F. Quinn, A. Sbarboro, A. E.
Bhattuek, William R. Sherwood.
It was learned from some of those pres
ent at the meeting, which was held with
closed doors, that the session was prin
cipally devoted to the discussion or the
new primary law and the probable effect
it would have on the organization of the
Non-Partisans in connection with the
municipal election to be held in November
next.
This election, the first under the new
charter, which givrs extraordinary power
to the Mayor, it was shown, would be one
of the most Important ever held in San
Francisco. It was pointed out that if the
primary iaw was operative it would com
pel tho'Non-Partisans, in order to actively
participate in the campaign, to organize
on a broader and more detailed plan than
was the case at the last election. To get
recognition as a party on the official bal
lot it would be necessary to hold a nomi
nating convention comprised of delegates
pelected at a primary election, and in or
der to hold such primary election it would

FIGHT IT OUT
IN THE COURTS
Kickers Will File a
Suit To-Day.
THEY WANT AN ACCOUNTING
CHARGE AUDITING COMMITTEE
WITH FRAUD.
Accuse Its Members of Trafficking
in Nominations and Misapplying
Money Collected From
Candidates.
The family row which has been brewing
Jn the ranks of the local Populists ever
Einco the November election is to be
fought out in the courts. The charges of
frpud and perversion of the campaign
fi; of the Populist party, which have
freely made during the past few
weeks by certain members of the county
committee, have taken the f r .*m of a suit
for an accounting, the papers in which
will be filed in the Superior Court this
morning by Attorney George TV. Monteith.
The title of the suit is: "W. N. Griswold
and Garrett W. Smith, plaintiffs, vs. A. B.
Kinne, George D. Gillespie, B. J. Pye,
Henry Huppert and William Meakln, de
fendants." All of the defendants are
members of the auditing committee,
otherwise known as the "purity of elec
tions committee 1 ' of the People's party,
and as such had full charge of the col
lection and disbursing of the campaign
fund. These same men also constituted
â¢what was known as the committee on
candidates nt the convention which nomi
nated candidates for office last October.
The complaint charges: "On information
and belief," that these men who "pre
tended to be and still pretend to be" mem
ADV^iRTISEMENTS.
The door of health stands open to every
woman who will enter. All that she needs
is the key and a little knowledge. The
knowledge that she needs is concerning her
Dwn nature, hei own physical make-up and
the principal cause of ill-health in women.
When a woman suffers from headaches
and pains in the back and sides, and burn-
ing and dragging sensations and the weak-
ness, nervousness and despondency that
arc caused by diseases peculiar to her sex,
she cannot enjoy good general health. The
key to the door of health â the cure for all
disorders of this description â is Dr. Pierce"s
Favorite Prescription. It is a medicine
specially devised for disorders of this na-
ture and no other. It is the invention of
an eminent and skillful specialist, Dr. R. V.
Pierce, for thirty years chief consulting
physician to the invalids' Hotel and Surgi-
cal Institute, at Buffalo. N. Y. When a
woman writes to Dr. Pierce she consults
a physician who has practiced for thirty
years right in one place, and who was some
years ago honored by his own townspeople
by an election to the National Congress.
He will answer letters from women free of
charge. All professional correspondence is
regarded as sacredly confidential.

become indispensable to organize club? in
every precinct in the city. This would
mean much labor and expense.
Another powerful reason for wishing
the primary law declared invalid was' the
apprehension that the bosses would cap- |
ture the primaries of the Non-Partisans,
elect delegates who would do tho bidding
ff the spoilsmen, and thus strike at the I
very vitals of the object of the Non-Par
tisansâthe selection of independent can
didates.
After a discussion which extended over
more than two hours the chairman was
instructed to appoint a committee of live
to investigate the matter. The inmmiitee
is authorized o consult with attorneys
qualified to pass upon the merits of the
question Involved. When this committee
is ready t" report, the chairman <>f the
county committee will be notified, and he
will then call another meeting of the full
committee to take further action in the
matter.
Tt has been current rumor for some
time past that the Non-Partisans had in
contemplation a reorganization on a
broader basis than that which existed
during the last campaign, the proposed
new body to be known as the Municipal
League. ' In this connection it was re.
ported that the most prominent members
of the Merchants' Association would be
asked to co-operate with the league.
When Chairman Fitch was asked about
this he declined to discuss the matter,
saying that the first step necessary at
this time was to determine the effect of
the primary law. After this had b,i en
settled the problem of reorganization
would be considered. He added that the
Non-Partisans were opposed to the pri
mary law. and that If any grounds ex
isted for defeating it in the courts the
necessary legal action would be taken.

precedent to their being nominated In each
respective case.
The receipts and disbursements during I
the campaign , according to the statement !
filed with the Registrar by the auditing
committee, shows a total of $1987 passed
through its hands. It is alleged by the
plaintiffs that a much larger sum was
collected which has not been accounted
for. and that the manner of accounting !
for the above sum is far from satisfac- |
tory. Kinne is alleged to have received |
l?Â£ 25 ir Glllesple - $150; P >' e - 129 = Meakln.
$100; Huppert, $50. and a man by the !
name of Wasch, $15. This money was
paid for "services, stamps, printing, etc." I
In its official statement the committee di- i
vided its expenditures as follows:
Salaries ;.| 750 00
Hall rents 178 75
Printing and painting 785 00 !
Stationery and stamps 59 75
Incidentals 267 97
Total $1,987 00
It is further alleged that certain sums
contributed to the campaign fund do not
appear in the names of the actual con
tributors, and that the amounts have
also been shaved down to make the total
appear smaller than that actually re
ceived.
The complainants ask that every can
didate nominated by the Populist con
vention in October be summoned to tes
tify as to the actual amount contributed
by each, and that the defendants be re
quired to render an accounting to the
county committee of the Populist party
and turn over to It all moneys found to
have been withheld by or misapplied by
them.
Attorney Monteith declares that the
case will be pressed energetically, and
that some interesting developments may
shortly be looked for.

TRUE HEROISM OF
A YOUNG INTERNE
DR. FRANK TiLLMAN, Who Nursed a
Leper Through Smallpox.
â  â¢ T- v R. FRANK TIL.L.MAN, an interne of the City and County Hospital, is â 
'? || only a beginner in the study of medical mysteries, but he has had a â¦;
<Â«> I ! practical experience that has boosted him far up the ladder of his pro- Â£
* â ' fession. He has cured an attack of virulent smallpox in a patient that *
'*â  was at the same time afflicted, in last stages, with tuberculosis and leprosy. â¢â¢
, : ; : , "I didn't cure the tuberculosis and leprosy," Bald the doctor yesterday, *
* "but I just let their two forces of bacilli fight among themselves while I j
<â¢> knocked out the microbes of the smallpox." <$>
;? During the first part of January a man named Charles Tulley. suffering *
* from smallpox, was removed from the French Hospital to the pesthouse Â£
<?> He was in that dreary place two days, when Dr. Tillman learned of the <-Â
* case and immediately volunteered .to attend the sick man. The enthusiast! *
*Â£ young Interne wanted the practice, and be followed his patient into a dreary '.".
<S> exile. He remained by Tulky'.s bedside almost night and day for several <Â£
* weeks, getting, as he expressed it, about all the practice he wanted.' They #
.'.' were hard weeks for the patient also, but possessing a strong constitution *$
*> he pulled through and Dr. Tillman was preparing to return from his seclu- ,j,
* sion, when the girl leper, Lena Grimm, who came to this city from *
"' Honolulu, contracted smallpox. The girl is not only a leper in almost its last <!Â»
*, stages, but is incurably afflicted with tuberculosis. Here was a case to.ap- r
* pall an experienced physician, but without any rest and not a single oppor
'." tunity for consultation with a fellow medico the young Interne rolled up â â¢â 
% his professional sleeves a little higher and went harder to work. *
* The leprosy had made such inroads Into the girl's system that there Â£
'?> seemed to be not a single sound tissue in her body on which to build a <Â£
*> cure. The medico did not worry over the organic complaints, as he had *
* only taken a contract to knock out the smallpox. He did so after a hard Â«r
4> battle, and is justly proud of his victory. Dr. Tillman vaccinated the pest- Â£,
1 house inmates wherever he could find a flesh surface sound enough to take : i :
% the healthy virus, and considers them smallpox immunes. . <Â§â¢
â¢$> During the pleasant evenings while he was isolated the doctor would Â£
* take a boat and go out in the slough duck-hunting. In the goodness of his
% heart he would ring up his friends and offer to send around some of the <Â£>
<S> game. The offer would be gratefully received, till it was known where the *
* dead birds came from, when he would be invariably told by "phone to keep. 'Â£.
<Â£ his d ducks where they were, and with some more warm expletives <Â»>
<*> commanded to stay in that . place with them; and this was the invita- *
* tion he received from his numerous friends by wire. T.
Â® Dr. Frank Tillman is a member of the class of '98 of the medical de- <;>
* partment of the University of California, and resides with his parents at *
* 1915 Larkin street. He does not seem to understand that he courageously
* risked his life when he exiled himself to nurse a smallpox patient among '
%' a crowd of incurable lepers, who were sure to take the new disease, and re- *
* gards the matter as only an ordinary incident in the life of a physician. He <?'
* is thinking of giving a lecture 'on "How I fought smallpox microbes wit* H"
* those of leprosy and tuberculosis and cured the smallpox only."

EVADES PAYING
THE DEBTS OF
THE DEMOCRACY
Hearst's Conditional
Offer Rejected.
SOUGHT TO GAIN CONTROL
DEMANDED CHAIRMAN MANN'S
KESIGNATION.
Party Leaders Charge the Editor
With Having Broken His
Promise â A Thinly
Veiled Threat.
A deficiency of $4000 in the treasury nf
the Democratic State Central Committee,
a.< a result of its recent disastrous cam
paign, has brought to light a remark
able chapter in California Democratic
politics and also promises some coming
< ba pters of interest.
The story is nothing lessthan an attempt
on the part of W. R. Hearst to force Seth
Mann, chairman of the State Central
Committee, to resign, and to place M. F.
Tarpey, now and for a long time raan
ager of the Hearst estate, in the chair.
The story so far is known only to the
State executive committee and a few oth
ers in the confidential councils of the par
ty, but it will interest every member of
the party from Siskiyou to San Diego.
Mr. Hearst, it will be remembered, ar
ri\. il here from New York in the closing
days of the campaign. The party was
short of campaign funds about ten days
before election, and Seth Mann, who had
been named by Maguire as chairman of
the State Central Committee: W. P. Law
lor, chairman of the campaign committee,
and a few other party generals and staff
officers, faced the problem of how to
make a proper finish to the campaign
without money.
Jn this dilemma Messrs. Mann and Law
lÂ«.r called on Mr. Hearst ami stated the
and limitations of the campaign.
Mr. Hearst said in effect: â¢â¢â¢Jo right
ahead, gentlemen. Go to whatever ex
p< rise Is necessary and I will attend to
the bills."
This was definitely understood by the
i ampaign managers as a guarantee, that
bills Incurn â ! would be paid.
The following day the Examiner started
a subscription, agreeing to double all con
tributions. Tne day before i-lection the
contributions were announced as amount
nich Mr. Hearst increased
to $6018 60 for the benefit of the campaign.
When the campaign committee gut its
bills together it was found that tne f.\
pendlturea made und<-r Mr. Hearsts gu.ir
amounted to about $10,000, and that
there were bills outstanding to the ex
tent of about $-1000.
It was well along in December when the
Democratic managers sought to close up
the campaign accounts. Mr. Hearst had
gone Kast and MÂ«-ssrs. Mann and Lawlor
called on A. M. Lawrence, managing ed
itor of the Examiner, and inquired what
Mr. Hearst would be pleased to do about
the situation. The guarantee given by
Mr. Hearst was recalled and stated by the
two gentlemen.
Mr. Lawrence gave no satisfactory an
swer, but communicated with Mr. Hearst.
After a time Messrs. Mann and Lawlor
called again by appointment. Mr. Law
rence, as it is reliably stated, and as the
incident la told and understood by a num
ber of Democrats, informed his callers
that Mr. Hearst had no recollection of giv
ing a guarantee such as they had stated.
That was a disagreeable misunderstand
ing at best, but Mr. Lawrence had some
thing further to say. He informed Mr.
Mann and Mr. Lawlor that, regard!
the fact thai Mr. Hearst was not respon
sible for the deficit, Mr. Hearst would pay
the $4<fcÂ«Â» owed if Mr. Mann would resign
the chairmanship of th<- State Central
Committee and let Mr. Hearst name the
man to fill the vacancy.
This was simply an ufffr of $4000 for the
chairmanship ot the Democratic State
Central Committee of California. But Mr.
Lawrence went further and Intimated
: Mr. Mann did not resign it w,is
likely that the management of the cam
paign and of the current course of the
committee would be found open to criti
cism. It was further intimated that if
Mr. Mann would quietly get out of the
way he would receive a most flattering
notice in the Examiner for the ability he
had displayed, etc., and that resolutions
here and there to the Bame effect would
undoubtedly follow. Mr. Mann thus re
ceived a fairly decent but resolute bid
ding to get out.
Mr. Mann quietly Informed Mr. Law
rence that resigning was the last thing
he thought of or would do.
It is said that not long after this a
prominent Democrat who had a little pat
ronage matter in hand went to Mr. Law
rence and asked him t<> Bee Chairman
Mann and get him to use his influence
in his behalf.
"Oh. its no usp to sre Mann." said Mr.
Lawrence; ''Tarpey'll be chairman. He's
the man to see. '
Matters remained quiet for a time and
then in the Examiner of February 2 last
came a tap of the club as a gentle re
minder thai it w.-is about time for that
resignation, for that day the Examiner
jogged the committee and Mr. Mann in
the following editorial:
The Stratton primary election bill Is making
Its way rapidly toward, adoption. Has the
Democratic State Central Committee consid
ered the measure, as we suggest It should do?
We regret to say that it has not.
What is the committee for at a time like
this it not to grapple with problems affecting
the party welfare and to try to steer the party
clear of rocks? Is the committee so certain
that no constitutional law ran be framed as to
primaries that it feels no interest in the bills
before the Legislature which deals with party
elections? If it is not. how can it justify its
failure to FtiHy the Stratton bill and all other
bills of a kindred nature and to seek to influ
ence the Legislature to a wise course In dealing
with them? " V -
It seems to us that the committee should give
some proof that it Is not in a trance.
On the evening of February 8 the Dem
ocratic Central Club, the largest party
organization in the city, having a mem
bership of 1100, held a meeting at which
were passed some resolutions that at
tracted no particular notice at the time.
They were introduced .by Democrats in
the secret and passed with a whoop by
members who knew only of the slap at
the State Central Committee in the Ex
aminer. In the light of explanations
they are part of the story. They were:
Resolved. That the members of the Demo
cratic State Central Club, having full fa.th In
the honor, ability and Integrity of the Hon.
Beth Mann, chairman of the Democratic State
Central Committee, do hereby pledge him our
most loyal support and such assistance as he
may call on us to give to aid him In securlnK
the' passage of a primary law that shall stand
the tept of law and Democratic principles, and
we further commend his course as chairman of
said committee and hereby volunteer any as
sistance In our power in carrying out the same.
It. was Observed that the Examiner
avoided any mention of Mann or the com
pliment paid him in its report of the meet
ing, and his name has not appeared in
its columns since the ultimatum was
given.
The campaign committee decided to
communicate with Mr. Hearst personally.
A few days ago a telegram of inquiry was
sent him and an evasive reply was re
ceived. Thereupon it was decided that the
I numeracy could survive without Mr
Hearst, and at a meeting of the executive
committee a day or two later Chairman
Mann was authorized to appoint a finance
committee to endeavor to raise enough
money to pay the deficit. The commit
tee has been appointed as follows; James
D. Phelan. James H. Budd. Walker C.
Graves. L. P Byington, Oscar Hocks, F.
J. Fallon. Timothy Treacy. This com
mittee met last Friday for the first time
and will make an effort to raise $1)00. If
it does not succeed the deficit is likely to
be referred to a full meeting of the State
Central Committe, which will probably be
called soon.
Chairman Mann will not resign, Mr.
Tarpey will not be the chairman right
away and Mr. Hparst will nut be in con
trol of the State machine very soon.

THE END OF
ALL RELIGIOUS
CONTROVERSY
Bishop Montgomery
Declares It Near.
WEAPONS OF SCIENTISTS
MADE USEFUL IN UPHOLDING
THE CAUSE OF RELIGION.
Interesting and Instructive Lecture
Under the Auspices of Mission
Council, Young Men's
Institute.
The Right Rpv. George Montgom
ery. Bishop of Monterey and Los Angeles,
delivered a lecture in Metropolitan Temple
last night, which, while being Instructive
and entertaining, contained a powerful
argument against the unbeliever and so
called "scientist."
The lecture was provided by thf> T. M. I.
Central Bureau, and was given under the
auspices of Mission Council No. 3. The
hall was crowded from pit to gallery, and
hundreds of people were turned away long
before the opening of the exercises. Th<;
first number on the programme was an
organ voluntary by R. Fletcher Tilton.
D. J. O'Leary. president of Mission Coun
cil. ma.de a few opening remarks, and
John M. Burnett, president of the evening,
made the opening address. Solos were
rendered by Miss Millie Flynn and Charles
Parent Jr.
President Burnett then Introduced the
speaker of the evening. Bishop Montgom
ery, who announced as his subject "The
End of Controversy."
"The century just past," he said, has
been one of unusual activity in every
branch of business and study. With all
this energy in growth, expansion and
change of parties and politicians. In no
pursuit or business has activity been
greater than in religious questions, let
with all the false ideas and antagonisms
evolved, the church stands to-day the
most conspicuous object and organization.
Our work is largely one of controversy,
as it is our mission to overthrow false
doctrines and point out the true path. J
think the end of all this controversy must
soon come, and I expect it to come from
the very people who have caused the most
of itâ the educated and the cultured.
"Your unbeliever tells you that in things j
supernatural the only guide is reason. He j
says that God has put a brain into man to ;
reason things out for himself; that ho can
be independent and does not need a leader
or an authority. .
"Vet he will not apply this principle to
natural things. When it comes to a ques
tion of law, of medicine, aye. or even
smaller things as language, art and mu
sic does your scientist attempt to reason >
them out for himself, or will he not go
straightway and consult an authority on j
the subject? If it is a question of law he ;
goes to the books and re. iris in them what
has been evolved, not by any one man's
reasoning powers, but by a number of the |
best informed on that subject. And so it
Is with all things finite. Â»Â«*Â«.Â«
"When it comes to the infinite, to the
supernatural, however, he tells you that
his own reason is all sufficient: that he
needs consult no law. and that he was in
tended to construe the revelations of the
Bible to suit himself. Thus my friends,
brings about religious anarchy in just the
same manner as Bocial anarchy would be
brought about if each man were a lowed
to construe the social laws .â¢â¢.â¢cording to
his own reasoning power, and this keeps
us continually in a broil of controversy.
"The *-nd is near at hand. These scien
tists who have sought to overthrow relig
ion have only strengthened It. and the
wiser ones have come to realize it and are
daily looking upon religion with more
friendly ey! t In fact, it has come to such
a pass now that when yon find a man
orating about science, investigation will
show that be really knows little or noth
ing about true science.
COMMENDS THE PRESS
FOR FIGHTING BURNS
REV WOODWORTH'S TIMELY
APPROBATION.
Mini3ters Say Harsh Things About
Chief of Police Lees During an
Interesting Discussion.
Rev. John A. B. Wilson read an interesting
paper before the Presbyterian Ministerial
Union yesterday on "The Civic Duty of
the Pulpit." His clear and convincing
argument on why the pulpit should take
cognizance of important questions on local
government made a profound impression
on those â¢ present. The doctor spoke of
the evils rampant in the city and or the
small effort being made to control them.
He dwelt on the influence large cor
porations have shown in governmental af
fairs and on other important questions.
The paper provoked an animated discus
sion, prolonging the session half an hour
beyond the usual time.
Rev James Woodwortn alluding to the
criticism of the press contained in the
paper said:
While I am disgusted with the press at
times, yet I very often read something in it
that causes me to shout 'â bravo" and clap my
hands If it had not been for the press those
things that have taken place or been attempted
in Sacramento in connection with the Legis
lature during the past two months would have
been done and passed over with scarcely a
reference and D. M Burns would be the
Senator elect from this State to-day. Now,
that is fo, and I will defy anybody to deny it.
Rev Soo Hoo Nam Art of the Presby
terian Church and Mission addressed the
meeting in English, saying:
I have been preaching for several years
steadily here among my countrymen, but I am
sorry to say have accomplished hut little. In
some respects we have lost ground. Crime and
Vice are increasing in Chinatown and becom
ing more open and flagrant. A few years ago
Rambling In that quarter was restricted to the
alleys; now It flaunts openly in the most pub
\Vhen I Pay. "Why don't the police stoD
this?" I was told by my countrymen and
friends of whom I Inquired, "Why. don't you
know' They pay JHOO a week for police pro
tection and Immunity!" I can't prove these
things but I know their truth, and I am dis
couraged In the same way and for the same
reason the infamous traffic In slave girls la
increasing dally.
Dr. Wilson in closing thp discussion
paid the blame for the infamous condi
tion of things existing in Chinatown was
due to the attitude of the police. Yet,
said he, the trouble is not with the force
Itself, but with its head. The police fopce
can Btop this slave trade and close up
every gambling den. all of which are now
carried on openly, in one week when they
get orders from "upstairs" to do it. They
would do it ff they were told to. But,
as it is now, they dare not if they would.
The patrolmen are not to blame. You get
a patrolman to help you shut up one of
these gambling dens or to free a slave
girl and be will be "broken" inside of six
months and be relegated to a "goat-town"
beat at ov.ee
What better can you expect of a police
force, the head of -which is an habitue
of every prizefight that enmes off, and
who sits and"looks on with stoical indif
ference or a real interest while a man is
piunded out of semblance of a human be
ing?

His troubles begin," if he has to depend
on an indifferent laundry at home to do
up his shirts, collars and cuffs. It
need be no cause of annoyance when
it is so easy tj have your linen laun-
dered just like new by our perfect
methods, and at such prices as we
charge for laundering them in a man-
ner that guarantees satisfaction.
