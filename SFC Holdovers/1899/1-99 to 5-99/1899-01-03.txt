CONVENING OF THE 33D SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE
Scenes and Incidents Attending the
Formal Opening Ceremonies.
The San Francisco Call.
SACRAMENTO. Tan. 2.â The* opening of the thirty
third session of the California Legislature occurred at.
noon to-day.
Formalities that are necessary for the temporary
organization of both houses of the State's law-mak
ing body were proceeded with uninterruptedly and
with a businesslike promptness that augurs well for the more
important matters that will engage the careful attention of
the members before the close of the session. Old, and new
members alike seemed impressed with a full realization of
the responsibilities that have been committed to their care
by the people of the State, and by their words and acts
sought to becomingly fulfill their duties.
The business of legislation and the steps necessary for
the formal organization of the Legislature are familiar mat
ters to at least one-half of the members assembled here to
day. In the upper house one-half of the Senators are hold
overs and are rich in the experience that they gained two
years ago and at previous sessions. Of the other half a fair
proportion have served at one time or another in one or the
other branches of the Legislature, and are therefore not to
be rated as novices.
Lieutenant Governor Jacob Xeff, who will preside over
the deliberations of the body during the coming two
months, has seen the incoming and outgoing of the State's
successive law-making bodies almost since the beginning of
the history of California. The deliberations of a legislative
body are as familiar to him as the windings of a country lane

arc to a farmer's lad. for he has held the Ravel on
so many important occasions that their number
is beyond recollection.
In the Assembly there is also a goodly pro
portion of familiar faces and no lack of legislative
lure. When Chief Clerk Duckworth rapped fo
ordcr he looked down on faces that, have fronted
the Speaker's stand in that. same Assembly Cham
ber at almost every session during the past twelve
. years. Of the new members there are few who
have not at least a passing knowledge of the formalities by
which they are expected to build the wishes and needs of
their constituents into laws. Those who are without that
knowledge are willing to learn. An active lobby and a de
sire to acquire knowledge can be counted on to produce re
sults on short notice.
There were others than legislators present at tne opening
session. This is the season of Sacramento's harvest and her
citizens of either sex are not slow to do it honor. Every
available foot of the floor space in the galleries and in the audi
torium of both the Senate and Assembly chambers was oc-_
cupied by those who were eager to witness the incoming ot
the new "body of legislators. Senatorial candidates and their
friends r.re here in force, and all were anxious to cet posi
tions where they would be in evidence before the men who
are soon to select a man to represent California in the upper
house of Congress. As much of a "pull" was necessary to
get a foothold in favored vantage place- as it takes to get a
political iob on the San Frauciscp water front.
To thosÂ« alixa 1 as honoring- the opfame
session with their presence must be added a small party of
political pot hunters who have gathered here- for purposes
of personal profit or prospective gain.

ASSEMBLY A LECTURE
Gagged the Members and Tried to
Make Them Take The
Medicine.
They Were Saved From Being Talked to Death by the
Firm Stand of Grove Johnson, Who Refused
to Stay Muzzled.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- 1
MENTO, Jan. 2.â Something very near
ly approaching a row marked the pro- 'â 
ceedings by which the temporary or
ganization -of the Assembly was ef
fected this afternoon. It was all caused
by an effort on the part .if Chief Clerk
Duckworth to read the members a
lecture on the errors of their imme
diate predecessors. As many of the
members of the present Assembly were
also members of the last session they
did not take kindly to the curtain lec
ture by their former chief clerk and a
whirlwind of protests was .the result.
At one stage of the proceedings there
was conveyed to Mr. Duckworth a
Strong intimation that unless he re
strained his apparent desire to deliver
a "roast" he would be removed from his'
place in the Speaker's stand by force.
Circumstances did not make it neces- j
sary for the makers of the threat to
chow their good faith and the lowering I
storm passed off as' quickly as it had
arisen.
Assemblyman Howard E. Wright of
Berkeley was elected Speaker, the mi
nority nominee being William Mi ad- of
"Los Angeles. Assemblyman Alden An
derson of Solano County was elected to
the position of Speaker pro tern.
By statutory provision the Chief
Clerk <â ! the prcctiimg Assembly must
call the new Assembly tv order and act '
as presiding officer until a Speaker has
been elected. It was" while acting as j
presiding officer that Mr. Duckworth
undertook to deliver his lecture to the
members. He took for his subject the
â¢ Investigation to which, he was sub
jected at the last session in connection
â¢with the number and the manner "f
their appointment of the temporary at
taches of the Assembly. Duckworth
.has always contended that all of the
.men he appointed at that time were
appointed at the request of various ,
members of the Assembly, and that:
they and not he were responsible if the j
.State suffered. He started in to-day I
to explain the situation to the members
of the present Assembly and incident
ally to seek to place the blame where
.he contended it belonged, It was this
fixing of the blame that got him into
trouble and created the uproar.
Many of the men whom Duckworth
holds responsible are members at the j
present session and they did not pro
pose to sit idly by and listen to a lec
ture on their alleged misdeeds. They ,
protested vigorously; but Duckworth
declared them all out of order, and j
even went so far as to call upon the
temporary sergeant-at-arms to keep
the indignant " members in their seats,
lie was not allowed to finish, however,
for when the protests assumed the na- [
ture of threats of personal violence he |
bowed -to the inevitable ami allowed
the members to proceed with the busi
ness of organization. He declared that j
his purpose had been accomplished, as .
he had called the attention of the public {
to the matter and he was willing to ;
allow the public to judge of the merits
of the case.
Aside from this incident Mr. Duck
worth performed the duties devolving !
upon him in a most exemplary. manner,
and the promptness with which he dis- |
patched the business before him robbed
the proceedings of half of their mo
notony.
It was just noon when a sounding tat- <
too from the gavel wielded by Chief Clerk J
Duckworth called fur order in the Assem
bly chamber, and conmanding silence for
what he had to say, Duckworth rose from
the chair of the Speaker and in the same
crisp, clear voice thai closed in his de
fense the session of '97 he began his
opening address.. He said:
"As chief clerk of the last Assembly it
becomes my duty under and by virtue of
the authority in me vested by the consti
tution and statutes of the State of Cali
fornia to request hi this time that the As
sembly, California Legislature, thirty
third session, will come to order". The min
ute clerk will note that, in conformity
with law, the following officers arc pres
ent: S. J. Duckworth, chief clerk; 11. Q.
"W'lckham, minute clerk; W. O. Banks,
sergeant at arms.
"Gentlemen, in its zeal to force economy
upon its 'successors, the last Legislature
refused to ma,ke provision for a chaplain
to invoke divine blessing upon the labors
of this House at this time. 1 will there
fore reQUest that for the next two min
utes there should be preserved the. most
complete order while the members and ofli-,
eers of the Assembly, each in his own way
', and according to the dictates of his own
conscience, address the throne of grace
in humble supplication for i \e wisdom re
quired to properly and acceptably dis
charge the duties of their respective po
sitions."
Duckworth was as good as his word.
For precisely two minutes he allowed the
aggregate conscience to wander to which
ever ends its various possessors best saw
lit. Then another rattle of the Duck
worth gavel, which, significantly enough,
was an ordinary hammer, the common
product of the hardware 800 brought
silence enough for Duckworth to announce
that the order of business was the swear
ing in of the memoers.
A resolution by Dibble, which was
adopted, facilitated that essential step. It
suggested that each member take the seat
assigned by the -Secretary of State. It was
adopted unanimously and then Duckworth
said: "In behalf and In the name of the
officers concerned, the following tempo
rary appointments are- now announce*:
By Sergeant at Arms W. O. Banks, W. 11.
Dahle to be assistant, sergeant at arms;
by Chief Clerk S. J. Duck .yon. to be
postmaster, W. T. Hamilton; to be gate
keepers; Daniel McPartland, W. S. Rey
nor, J. Hocking: EoÃ'e pages. A. A. Fried
lander. W. W. Benchly. G. W. McConder.
"I will now call the roll of members
elected," as certified by the Secretary of
State. As each member is called he will
please respond If he be present."
After rojlcajl . .Mr. Duckworth said:
Gentlemen, there being more than a
quorum present- and the hour haying ar
rived for the members to be sworn in, a
motion would now be in order as to the
manner in which we are going about it.
You have accepted the roll <as presented
â "by the Secretary of State. The question
now la; the manner In which the members
will come up to the desk to have the oath j
or office administered to them."
Mr. Dibble â l move that ten members at
a time be called and be sworn by the Su
perior Judge In attendance.
Motion seconded and carried.
Mr. Duckworthâ l beg leave to announce
that Superior Judged. C. Hi rt of the
county of Sacramento lias been Invited to
administer the oath of office to the mem
bers-elect.
Then in bunches of ten they lined up be
fore the desk of the Speaker and the Sac
ramento jurist administered the oath.
Then came th( Duckworth opportunity.
Critically sizing up the sea of faces before
him as though to find lust how far he
would be, allow to proceed w"l|tbe ex
pression of the pent-up bitterness he ha
so carefully nursed these last two yearn,
he -an a speech ! from the Speaker's
halt thct for bald audacity and well-En
glished contumely ir â .- Ma t-i.ly paniilrl in,
that other harangue of his that marked
the last .session.
"Before â¢ going any further with the
settled order of things." began Duck
worth, "I desire as your temporary pre
siding officer to address a'few words of
advice and explanation to you and to the
people of this State represented by you
upon this floor. As chief clerk of the As
sembly which adjourned March 16, 1595.
I presided at the opening of the Assembly
two years' ago. performing for that dis
tinguished body the same service I am ;
performing now for this House. My duties !
then, as now. began at 12 o'clock, noon,
and ended at -i o'clock in the afternoon |
of January 4. 1897, at which hour I ad
ministered to Frank 1.. Coombs. Speaker
of the Assembly-elect, the constitutional
oath of office, whereupon he entered
upon the discharge of his duties as pre
siding officer of the Assembly. At the
request of many members of the House '
I had handed in and read. from the desk
a list of attaches numbering li- to trans

Belshaw of Contra Costaâ Mr. Chief
Clerk, n question of information.
Mr. Duckworth â Gentleman from Con
tra Costa.
Belshaw â I would like to know if it is
within the province of the chief clerk to
deliver a lecture to this Assembly, or .
whether it is his province to organize the !
House as speedily as possible?
Mr. Duckworthâ ln reply to the gentle
man the clerk will slate that according
to law up to 18ST7 it was the province of
the clerk. merely to preside at the open
ing of the Assembly. According to the
rules laid 'down by the body of two years
ago It also becomes the duty of the chief I
clerk, â  especially when he has been a :
member of the House before, to give to
the newly elected members the benefit
of a few words of advice, and I am en
deavoring to comply with that.
Mclick uf Pusadenaâ Chief Clerkâ
Mr. Duckworthâ Mr. Melick.
Mr. Melickâ 1 move that we do now pro
ceed to organize this House.
Mr. Duckworth Come to order. Noth

Mr. Melickâ Mr. Clerk, I appeal from
tho decision of the chair.
Mr. Duckworth Your appeal will not be
sustained. Gentlemen of tho Assembly,
during t ho first two weeks of that session
the public prints teemed with criticisms
of the Assembly for the extravagance
committed In the temporary organisation.
On January 12 there was Introduced a res
olution culling for information relative to

taches had been employed.
Mr. Mellckâ Mr. Chief Clerk, a matter
of personal privilege.
Mr. Duckworthâ gentleman is out
of order until the chair gets through
talking.

Mr. Duck*worfhâ By this time every

Numerous voicesâ Mr, Chief Clerk.
Mr. Puckworthâ ThÂ« sergeant at arms

Mr. Melickâ l appeal from the decision

Mr. Duckworthâ The appeal is not sus

his duty.' By this time, January 12. every
newspaper in the State except those pub
lished hi Monterey County, where I was
well known, charged me" with responsi
bility for the expenditure Incurred In this

educated to believe that In some mysteri
ous manner I. a total stranger to fully
90 per cent of thÂ« temporary attaches, and
without voice or vote, either In the Re
publican caucus or upon thjl floor of this
Mouse, had appointed 112 uhnecssary at

Treasurer Into paying them exorbitant
salaries for nothing. No one was mi re
active in spreading this false and in
famous Idea than Speaker Coombs, who

tlon. He unhesitatingly approved that
document when it was presented to him;
and when Hit- pross began to â¢ criticizse
tli" Legislature for it s extravagance, he
was the tirst to suggest that I Bhould
volunteer to assume all responsibility
therefor, and thus save the fond name of
the Republican party and its legislators

Mr. Wadeâ Mr. Clerk, I protest against

the last Speaker of the House.
Mr. Belshaw â I second the protest.
Mr. Duckworthâ lf the gentlemen will
bear with me a minute they will see it Is
no; an assault. It is merely quoting rrom
the records and the public prim; of the
day. When the Speaker of the last As
sembly, as all of you who were members
at that time know, went down upon the
floor of this House and requested that the
Gr.-'nd Jury of this county be called upon
to Investigate my a<'ts. when 1 bad per
formed none, you did not protestâ any of
you. 1 refused to assume the responsi
bilities that 1 was asked to aSÃume and
insisted upon a public investigation of the
whole matter. In the meantime I had
completely broken down in health, and
the Inquiry was started while l was con
fined to my bed and even members of my
own family were denied admission to my
room. And there were none then to pro
test. Every person suspected of being
able to in anywise reflect â
Mr. Belshawâ Mr. C'nief cierk. T move
that the address of th<- Chief Clerk be
printed and submitted to thÂ«- members of

be dispensed with.
Voices- Second the motion.
Mr. Duckworthâ The motion Is out of
order. [Laughter.] I will do this, gentle
men: if you desire it I will compromise
with you upon this proposition. If you
do not desire to hear my remarks from
this. desk let them appear in the journal
of the House for to-day. [Cries of "N-o,
sir: no, sir."]
Mr. Duckworthâ Then, sir, I shall pro
ceed. 1 was just sayingâ
A memberâ Mr. Clerk.
Mr. Duckworthâ What Is the name.
please?
Mr. Brownâ l arise to a point of order.
That is, that the clerk has no right to ad
dress this body from the chair. The
Speaker would not have that right. If
he desires to address this House he
should take his position on the
floor and act as a member. Call some
body to the chair; you are out of order.
The Clerkâ Your point of order is not
well taken.
Mr. Brownâ l desire to appeal from the
chair.
Mr. Duckworthâ Your appeal is not sus
tained. I desire to impress upon the mem
bers of this House that it Is my purpose
to say to the House what I intend to say.
and you might as well make up your
minds to hear it now or let it go in the
record.
Grove L. Johnson of Sacramentoâ Mr.
Chief Clerk, I nominate for Speaker of the
Assembly Howard E. Wright of Ala
m< da.
Voicesâ Second the nomination.
Mr. Johnsonâ Are there any other nomi
nations?
Mr. Duckworthâ a minute, sir.
You are out of order.
Mr. Johnsonâ All those that are in favor
of Mr. Wright for Speaker will say aye.
Th' ayes appear t<> be unanimous. Those
opposed, "no." The ayes have it. and
Mr. Wrigfyt it elected Speaker, and I will
.ipl>i>i]it--
Mr. Duckworthâ The Speaker cannot be
elected except by rollcall of the members
of the 1 1
Voicesâ Rollcall! Rollcall!
Mr. Duckworthâ Mr. JohnsQn, you will
pardon me, the motion is not In order.
Mr. Johnsonâ Why. yes it Is. You cannot
stand there and lecture us. If we treated
you as you deserved we would take you
by force from that chair, but we do not
want to do such a thing as that.
Mr. Duck worthâ Possibly you could.
Now it is not my aesire â
.Mr. Johnson â I sat here and heard these
gentlemen appeal from your decision and
heard you refuse to put the appeal. Why,
< Ijjar Reed would not dare do that. You
are doing wrong. Just put the appeal of
Mr. Mellick or Helshaw and let that be
decided, or otherwise call the roll upon
the nominations for Speaker. You have
no right to stand there and talk about
people or men. If you have a grievance,
publish your grievanceâ publish your
: grievance In a newspaper. Mire a hall
! and mukf a speech there. (Cries â Good
boy.) But you have no right lo do that
from the chair. Now, Mr. Chief Clerk,
i unless you are willing to pui the appeal
of Mr. Mellick, I. as a member of this
Assembly, have a right to have a Speaker
cli cted and to have the roll called.
Mr. Duckworthâ l will call for the elec
tion of a Speaker, with simply this ex
planation: This demonstration here to
daj will have its proper weight accorded
1 it by all of you. I was merely asking for
the rights that were given to others and
denied me before. If you desire, gentle
men, to follow in the footsteps of that
House, well and good. 1 have no desire to
force myself or anything that 1 may huve
to say upon you.
Mr. Johnsonâ Now. Mr. Chief Clerk. I
offer the following resolution:
"Resolved, That the standing rules ,of
the thirty-second session lie and they are
hereby adopted as the temporary rules of
this House until otherwise ordered, with
the following changes, to wit : '1899' shall '
be inserted in lieu of '1897' wherever these ;
latter figures occur."
Though he had more to say, Duck- ,
worth gave up the fight. The yells of ap- !
prova! that greeted Johnson's" veiled Dut
forceful threat to throw him out unless
his Invective were hushed was pott nt,
and when the proposed resolution was i
handed up he lust no time in getting it be
fore the housÂ°. it goes without saying
that it carried, and in carrying it cut
Duckworth out from the right to tin- floor
lie had claimed under the ame ded rules.
Nominations came next in order, and
they were allowed to proceed eloquently.
In a ringing speech Valentine of Los An
geles proposed Ho ...m 10. Wiicir I -
] Speaker. In nominating him he sa
"Mr. chief Clerk and gentlemen of the
1 Assembly, we are aboui to enter upon
! th>- duties of this Thirty-third Assembly
session. In so 'i'li.i;. the most Important
dut: confronts us ai the outset, and that
is the selection ami election of .. proper

of his cool and calm manner, of liis spM'

We know that he is fully equipped in
every particular to dischart;.: tin- duties of
the distinguished office of Speaker of thU
Assembly. And 1 can say to you now,
members-elect here, that in Howard E.
Wright of Alamedaâ (app>uuse,iâ we have
a gentleman than whom there are none
better qualified to preside over â  des
tinies of the Assembly. Now, Tarn not
going to take up your ;.nit- with a pro

ready been consumed in useless talk â
(Cries of "Good")â and I therefore take
great honor and pleasure in nominating
Mr. Howard ]â¢:. Wright of Berkeley for
Speaker of the Assembly for the thirty
third session."
"As one of the members of the last
session." said Robinson of Grass Valley,
"I wish to briefly state that I reiterate
every word that Mr. Valentine has said
in behalf of Mr. Wright, and 1 take pleas
ure in seconding the nomination of Mr.
Wright for Speaker of the Assembly."
William Meade of Los Angeles was pro
posed an the nominee of the minority end
when the balloting closed the vote stood
56 for Wright and IS for Meade.
Mr. Duckworth took pleasure in declar
ing Mr. Wright elected, and appointed
Robinson. Feliz of Monterey and Wade
of Napa to escort him to the chair, where
he took the oa'h of office.
Speaker Wright made not much in the
way of a speecn. but what he did say was
to the point and strongly sincere. Said he:
"Gentlemen of thi Mouse, I had intend
ed addressing' you at some length upon
the policies which I hope tiis legislative
session will -ursue, uut time has been lost
and I will simply express the deep appre
ciation or gratitude which 1 feel for the
kind expression you have given here to
day.
"There are immense responsibilities de
volving upon this office of Speaker, but I
shall regard them lightly if our relation
ship develops into one of continence and
respect, ami I assure you that I shall at
tempt and endeavor to conduct myself, as
Speaker of '.his Assembly, in such a man
ner as to compel the confidence and re
9pect of you all. Gentlemen, nominations
are now In order for Speaker pro tern."
To Amemblyman Belshaw of Contra
Costa .'^l the dut" of nominating am- n
Anderson of Suisun for Speaker pro tern.,
and he did so as follows:
"Mr. Speaker and gentlemen of the As
sembly: The pleasant duty has been as
signed me to nominate our caucus nomi
nee for Speaker nro tern. The gentleman
whom I shall name is a man well known
throughout the State for his uprightness
mid probity and his thorough knowledge
of parliamentary proceeding is ;i satisfac
tory guaranty that he will be able to meet
all the exigencies of the occasio.i which
may devolve upon him as Speaker pro
tern. It is therefore with great pleasure
that 7 nominate for Speaker pro tern. the
Hon. Alden Anderson of Solano County."
(Applause.)
McDonald of T^ivermore seconded Mr.
Anderson's nomination, and Hanley of
San Francisco nominated Eugene Sullivan
, of the same place as the candidate of
the minority. Anderson was elected by
a vote of .">", to IS. and In accepting Ins
office Mr. Anderson said:
"Mr. Speaker and members of the As
sembly, I thank you. and I believe that
I fully appreciate the Importance and
the dignity of the honor which you have
conferred and ! feel that it would bo an
honor to preside or to act in ,\ny capac

as I see before me. and 1 can only say In
conclusion that whenever I itn caUed
upon to art for you I will endeav
do so in an impartial manner and re
cording to the best of my ability, ami aid
the work in the line of economy and right
and good cause and good government."
< Applause.)
Assemblyman Cobb placed 'n nomina
tion Ma' r< or C. W. Kyle for chief clerk of
the Assembly, and the major found as
his opponent Ben Maddox. the choice of
the minority. The vote that occurred
after the talking had ceased sto:id s:'. for
Kyle and 10 for Maddox.
The only opposition to ex-Senator F.ankn
of San Francisco for sergeant at arms
was the minority candidate, George R.
Cote. Banks won out by practically the
same vote that had been giv<-n his pre
decessors. With the spearing in of the
newly elected officers the Immediate work
was finished, and DibMe got up to say
that owing to the parsimony of the Leg
islature there were no more roll calls on
band and that there would be none until

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA- |
MENTO, Jan. Blissful quiet marked
the proceedings of the three sessions
of the Senate to-day. What little scrap
ping there was over the patronage
took place in the Republican caucus, so
there was nothing but the barest rou- j
tine work to mark the opening of the j
thirty-third session of the upper h^-use
of the Legislature.
Early in the day it seemed probable ,
that the Senate would not complete its
organization to-day, owing to the <
scramble for places at the disposal of |
the members, but it was absolutely j
essential that the body get into work- j
ing order at once, so that there might i
be no hitch in Gage's plan to have him- j
self inaugurated on Wednesday, in or
der to hold Burns 1 gambling partner,
Gunst, in office, and as the Democrats ,
manifested no inclination to interpose
obstacles the programme was hurried j
through in three short sessions.
Lieutenant Governor Jeter was con- j
spicuous by his absence, but he is ex
pected to be here in time to induct his
successor into office.
Lieutenant Governor Neff was an in
terested spectator at all three sessions
and was the recipient of complimentary
greetings of members from both sides
of the house. The new members set- 1
tied right down to business without any j
apparent feeling of rawness, while the 1
old-timers exchanged greetings and it '
of divergent political views- chaffed erne
another on the recent election and the
Senatorial tangle, honors being about
even.' â  . ,-â .â â 
Porter Ashe and Sig Bettman occu- j
pied adjoining seats and appeared to I
be on the friendliest terms.
At the day sessions there were a large
number of spectators, including many]
ladies, in attendance, but the proceed
ings were too harmonious to be at
tractive, bo the gallery was deserted at
night.
It was exactly 12:35 p. m. when Senator
B. F. Langford. the Nestor of the Senate,
mounted the platform and with three
sharp raps of the gavel called the thirty
third session of the State Senate to order.

"The hour of noon having arrived, and
in the absence of the President of the
Senate, it becomes my duty to call to :
order the thirty-third session of the Sen
ate Mr. Secretary, you will please call
the' roll of the hold-over Senators. By;
the way we will first have prayer by the
chaplain, the Rev. A. J. Sturtevant"
The chaplain offered a short invocation,
after which the roll of hold-over Sena
tors was called, all answering to their
names. Then came the roll of newly
elected Senators, John F. Davis of Am
ador being the only absentee. These were
then called up to the President's desk â¢
in three detachments and were adminis
tered the oath of office by Judge Hughes
of Sacramento.
Smith of Kern offered a resolution pro
viding that the Senate proceed to the
election of president pro tern., secretary,
sergeant at arms and chaplain. It was
adopted and Morehouse placed in nomi
nation for president pro tern. Senator
Thomas Flint Jr. He was seconded by
Dickinson. Doty nominated Senator
Langford, the nomination being seconded
by Sims. The rollcall showed 24 votes for
Flint and 14 for Langford, Flint being
declared elected.
For secretary, Short of Santa
Clara nominated Frank J. Brandon, who j
was seconded by Simpson of Los Angeles.
Ashe of San Francisco nominated Thomas
J. Welch for the Democrats. Brandon
was elected by a vote of 24 to 14.
Rev. Mr. Sturtevani was nominated
for chaplain by Currier of Orange and
was elected without opposition.
Alameda received its reward in the
election of Lou Martin for sergeant at
arms. Senator Leavitt placing him in
nomination. The Democrats presented the
name of George \V. Lewis for the place,
he receiving: the 14 votes of the minority
to 25 for Martin.
Wolfe of San Francisco offered a reso
lution providing that the rules adopted
by the last Senate be adopted by the pres
ent body, excepting rules 3fi and 38 Wolfe
explained that rule 36 provided for stand
ing committees. Rule 38 provided that
the chairman of the standing committees
be allowed clerks with the permission of
the Senate. The resolution was adopted.
Senator Smith gave notice that the Re
publican Senators would caucus in the
Supreme Court chamber at 2:30 p. m.
Dickinson of M.inn moved that a recess
be taken until 4:30 p. m. and it was car
ried.
It lacked two minutes of 5 o'clock when
the â¢Republican caucus had" made up Its
list of attaches and President pro tern.
Flint called the Senate to order.
After the clerks and assistant to the
sergeant at arms had been named, Cut
ter of Yuba offered a resolution appoint
ing the others, which was adopted with
out opposition. The complete list is as

the evening session to order at 8:20 p m
Dickinson offered concurrent resolution
â No. l, providing that a committee of
three be- appointed to confer with a com
mittee of four from the Assembly and
arrange for the inaugural ceremonies the
joint committee to have full power to act
JloOO to be appropriated for the parade
and other ceremonies, the expenses to be
borne ally by the two houses. Dick

would take place Wednesday and {hat no
plans whatever had been made for the
occasion. Smith said that nothing was
done by the Legislature four years ago
'" P r o v > dln for the inauguration, and he

Cutter suggested that $1500 was, too
much money to spend for such a purpose,
and offered an amendment reducing the
appropriation to $1000. Wolfe thought â 
that $1500 was not too great a sum, and
.Dickinson said he would refuse U> serve
on the committee if the appropriation was
cut to $1000. He said it would be news
sar to bring troops from San Francisco
to make a creditable display, which would
cost in the neighborhood of $500; music
carriages and other expenses would bring
the total up to something like $1500. He
believed the committee could be trusted
to see that money was. not squandered.
After a conference between Dickinson
and Cutter the latter withdrew his
amendment and offered another making
the amount of the. appropriation $1250.
Dickinson accepted the amendment and
the resolution was adopted. ,- '

MENTO. Jan. 'J.â "l am a â  andidate for
T'nitni States Senator."
Such was th'> public declaration made
by D. M. Burns to-dj y. ThÂ» announce-
Bun ndidacy was made
several weeks ago by W. P. Herrin,
political manager for the Southern Pa-
Company. It was announced to
day by Colonel Burns himself, but
without the embellishments that Mr.
Llerrin put on the news.
Colonel Burns says: "I am a candi
date for Senator."
Mr. Herrin said: "Colonel Burns is
Southern Pacific Company's candi-
Senator."
li" there was over a doubt in Burns' (
mind as to whether or not he would
finally announce the candidacy ho has
promoting by .very means in his
power during the past tour weeks, it
was dispelled last Saturday after his
rence with Governor-elect Gage at
the Palaci Hotel in San Francisco. At
the conclusion of the conference word

Governor-elect of the State: by the use I

poration of which Collis P. Huntington

and he proposes to win, by the corrupt J
use of money furnished him for that ,

and the betrayal of friendships. Win
it he will, if there are enough dishonest
men in the present legislature, who, ;
besides being dishonest, are sufficiently
deficient in conscience to disregard the :
consequences of their infamy as indi
cated by their vote for the railroad ''
candidate.
Governor-elect Gage arrived here to
day, but he is apparently not the same j
Governor-elect Gage who made a spe- ;
eial trip to San Francisco Saturday to j
hold a secret conference with Colonel
Burns.
Governor-elect Gage, who is here in
Sacramento to-day, is apparently a to
tal stranger to Colonel Burns. If h?
has seen the railroad's candidate for
Senator since his arrival it was at long
range. He took particular care, how
ever, to call on the Senatorial candi
date from Los Angeles County, and so |
anxious was he to have the gaping mul
titude know that he was bent on hav
ing friendly intercourse with the can
didate from his own county that he
warmed a chair in the latter's head- [
quarters for half an hour this after- |
noon, much to the mystification of the
passing throng of hangers-on among the
legislative camp followers.
But Governor-elect Gage did not call
on Colonel Burns, of whom he said to
Gov< rnor Budd: "I am under deep ob- '
ligations to Colonel Burns. He wishes
to retain Police Commissioner Gunst ;
in office and I have promised to carry !
out his wishes." It would seem to a j
disinterested observer that Mr. Gage's
failure to resume his cordial relations j
with Colonel Burns here in Sacramento
is due to the fact that he is ashamed ]
to let the assembled legislators know j
that he is lending support to the Sena- j
torial candidacy of a man whose name !
adorns the criminal records of two re- j
publics. It may be that he is in the j
act of prostituting the high office to
which the people have just elected him
by ÃBin~ it to force the unwilling en- |
operation of State legislators in the!
candidacy of a man who is opposed by i
alniost every self-respecting citizen in j
the State \Vhiehe\ - f>r way the truth !

havo gathered h^re in one capacity or
another, expecting to be witnesses of
good results they believed would fol- |

Governor to direct and annrove the
acts of a Republican Legislature.
The fact thHt these things are oc

B A determined effort is on foot to force the election of Daniel M. Burns as â

m fill power that can possibly be brought to bear is being wielded to that end. B
Forces rooral and forces immoral r;ave been p^alanxed with that one object in view. H

THE BURNS BLUFF
OF LITTLE AVAIL
His Active Support Will Fall
Short of His Claims.
A Show of Mexican Bullion Made to
Influence Venal Legislators â Hod
e>t Citizens Oppose Him.
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 2.â A1l the signs to-night
point to a flat refusal upon the part of
a majority of the Republican members of
the Legislature to go into caucus on the
Senatorship. Jt is also foreshadowed
that the high tide of Burns' vote will be
registered on the first ballot, for the
simple reason that every member who
joins the Burns force after the first show
ing of his strength will be placed under a
cloud of suspicion.
The fact is becoming appreciated that
Burns' boasted strength is a bluff. The
touts are constantly shouting that Dan
will win out easily and that every mem
ber of the Legislature whose preference
for Barnes, Bulla, Grant or Knight is not
announced is a Burns voter on the wind
up. The Burns men are pretty well
known to-night and the number is much
less than thirty-five, Which they claim.
When they talk among themselves they
concede weakness by suggesting that Dan
has M. M. Estee in holding as the real
dark horse and at the proper time will
bring out his Senatorial steed.
The "colonel" can put up a tine bluff, as
all who are familiar with his campaign
methods understand. The other day one
(if his followers had himself interviewed
and went on to tell the public, through
the press, how he went down to the
smelting works ami saw there a stack of
bullion from the Candelaria mine that
was worth at least $2Sfl,o(Mi. The obvious
purpose of the story was to hold over the
suggestion to the coin-seeking patriots
that Dan had the stuff iÂ£ he decided to go
Into the fight.
If other candidates were inclined to seek
support on account of wealth in sight
General Barnes might say that George R.
Wheaton, a rich and generous merchant
of San Francisco, was among his active
lieutenants. The fact is that Mr. Whea
ton, whose father represented California
in the Legislature with honorable dis
tinction, believes that men who value a
residence in California and hold the good
name of the commonwealth In high re
gard, should take an active interest in
this contest for the Senatorship. He will
be joined by other merchants of charac
ter and influence, who consider it high
time that a protest should be lodged
against the election of Moses Gunst'a
'gambling partner to the office of United I
Slates Senator from California.
These men renrescnt mUllnaa acquired '
in :...,,, >i industries, /.id would not spen4
a dollar to debauch a Legislature. The j
men whose intellect, enterprise and toll
have made California a great and prosper
ous State are not in Dan Burns' light.
They do not desire to see California de
graded in the eyes of the country. and they
expect that the decent and high-minded
Republican members of the Legislature
may be persuaded to their way of think
ing. When they come to Sacramento It
will be as reinforcement of the reserve
strength of the commonwealth.
FEDERAL OFFICIALS
WORKING FOR BURNS
The Whole Brigade Leave Their
Work to Boom the Mexican.
Trying Bard to Co wince the Un
sophisticated That the National
Administration Is Backing
Their Favorite for

CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO. Jan. 2.â The friends of Barnes.
Bulla and Grant are not pleased with
the spectacle of Federal office-holders
leaving their respective posts of duty
in San Francisco to come to Sacra
mento and boom Dan Burns for United
States Senator. On the trail of those
lobbyists of the Federal brigade can be
heard whispers that the administration
at Washington is in sympathy with
Burns' efforts to obtain a seat in the
United States Senate.
When the facts come to light it will
be shown that President McKinley ha 9
not made a suggestion in the direction
Indicated. The hint nf sympatKy in
Washington is thrown out to break the
force of moral pressure against the
election of Burns to a place in the Sen
ate of the United States.
This last dodge in behalf of Burns
brings out an incident of the last gu
bernatorial campaign which has not
been published. Th-re was a deter
mined effort made by the Los Aneeles
Times to force two Federal office-hold
ers on the Republican executive com
mitteeâ Osborne and Flintâ to -resiern.
The facts were placed before the United
States Attorney General and presum
ably laid before the President. The At
torney General referred the committee
to Webster Davis for investigation. He
did investigate and subsequently re
ceived notice that the President was
not inclined to punish a Federal office
holder for taking a proper interest in
public affairs. No further attention
was thereafter paid to the T,os Ange
les remonstrance against tho party ser
vice rendered by the Federal office
holders in behalf of the State Republi
can ticket. Burns and his friends as
sume, therefore, that the activity of
Federal office-holders is commended by
the President, and actinj? on the hint
thrown out by Webster Davis, the bri
gade is in Sacramento doing politics for
Burns.
The important fact is overlooked that
a Senatorial contest is a Republican
family affair. The contest is between
elements within the party, and not
against forces outside of the Republi
can organization. President McKinUv
would riot for an instant entertain a
proposition to allow his influence to be
used to defeat General W. H. X
Barnes. The President understands and
appreciates the eloquence and able ser
vice rendered by General Barnes in the
memorable Presidential campaign two
years age and, like Governor Gage, en- |
tertains a sense of gratitude for the |
loyal and able support extended by the
eloquent apostle of Republican doc- I
trine.

MENTO, Jan. To-day has been a i
season of sunshine and shower. One !
moment the rain would be falling ,
briskly and the next the clouds would
be driven away, only tor return. In
deed, the weather has been typical of
the Senatorial aspirations, as the lat- i
ter is revealed to the unbiased under
standing. The men who have high
hopes now may have them dashed, and j
while they lament, see them gather
again as good as new.
The only circumstance pointing to [
this as a holiday was that the boot
blacks charged 10 cents for a shine. If
anybody else observed the existence of
1599 they made no sign. Certainly the
politicians took no rest, but wagged '
their jaws with patriotic fervor, and :
crooked not the pregnant hinges of j
the knee so much as hinges of the el
bow. The spectator -of politics, partic- j
ularly when so important a matter as j
the making of a Senator is at hand, will
never be able to divorce statesmanship !
from mixed drinks. Diplomacy leans i
against the bar and takes in an atmos
phere blue with tobacco smoke. It talks
loudly when confident, it whispers its j

It is possible to feel a lack of ad- j
miration for these busy people, a.l- j
though they do not realize this. When j
a knot of them is seen exchanging
mysterious winks, suspicion comes into
the mind that a job is under way. Per
haps this suspicion is unworthy, and j
those who think so are at liberty to dis- j
miss It. There are many classes em- '
braced in the throng. A part are on
loukers, some are here to buy, s >me to
be. bought and doubtless many who are
not for sale nor making bids.
The Inevitable impression is, how
ever, that purity in politics is a dream.
Wandering among the workers 1 have
tried to got an inkling of the situation
and have succeeded in getting several.
In crossing the ollice of the Golden
Kiigle. It" IS' 1501'- Â«nOTmiirm"to-tiras
suired that Duma Is a certainty, that
Grunt cannot lose, that Barnes has a
good chance, that Bulla has a reserve
strength calculated to paralyze and ex
terminate the opposition. Indubitably
there iÂ» a mistake- somewhere. I make
no attempt to locate it.
â What was intended to be a sensation
was the springing of the candidacy of
Dun Burns. With an apparent serious
ness stamping him a merry jester.
Burns did this and appealed to Califor
nia to vindicate him. He is asking too
much. It is a strange spectacle. An
offender against the laws, long enjoy- j
Ing immunity, not satisfied with this,
and begging for a certifi ate of good I
character. He wants California to con
done his crimes and become accessory
after the fact. Yet Burns is not with-'
out friend! Sig Hettman remains true!
and Keneaftly Is firm as a rock.
The Burns headquarters are conduct
ed on a different plan from the others?. j
General Barnes keeps the door ot his
apartments wide open. The doors to
Omul's and Bulla's swing to anybody's
touch, L t to enter the Burns sanctum
there must be passed an outside and
an inside guard. What magic words
hvmiotize ttust- faithful function: . -
has not been revealed to the non-elect..
but men were passing In and out mi
day. The rumor that they were in in
stances heard to clink when they, came
from within I am not prepared to con
firm.
Grant's managers are asserting that
victory is anxious to perch on their
banners, and are getting the banners
ready for the emergency. Several weeks
ago I wrote that the man from San \
Diego, with a perfectly organized cam-!
paign, which was under way while his 1
rivals were just beginning to wake up. ;
would be in the fight to the last and
that his hope of winning was not vain
nor foolish. Supposing the issue were
to narrow down to him and Burns, as
seems to me probable, 1 predict a stam
pede to Grant and am unable to see
things any other way. Certainly such
a thing as a stampede to Burns is too
tough a proposition to be considered.
and when his struggle becomes futile
his friends will desert him. for such. I
believe, Is the precedent Bet by himself.
But to the end he can depend upon
Bettman, Ken, .ally and Dennery, if the j
last can get in, which 1 hope he can't.
and if the second could square himself
with the courts so as not to be needed
in San Francisco.
But because Burns and Grant seem
to one spectator the leading figures it
does not follow that Bulla and Barnes
have not stanch friends, followers of
each making prophecy as pleasing
to his own heart and understanding. It
is certain that Bulla also has a follow
ing which will cling while there is a
chance to cling and which cherishes the
conviction that this candidate of the
south will be sustained in the final
grand rush.
Personally, Barnes is popular, for
several reasons, Including that rare gift
of oratory which makes of a star not a :
point of light, but "torch burning im- I
mortal in the midnight skies." A littleof
that tossed lightly into a tariff debate
would tend to cheer the nation. This
in all I know about the candidates and
possibly more, journalists by whom I ;
Get one cake

I have the honor to be surrounded tak
i ing a different view as to each parti
â  cular.
Burns and Kelly met to-day, shook â¢
! hands and neither touched the other j
: for a cent. It was regarded by all be
holders as a fine exhibition of self-ab
negation and shows the control the
i trained diplomat can acquire over nat- j
ural instincts. However objectionable i
the professional politician may be he is '
i less objectionable than the seeker after
a job gets occasionally.
I have in mind the purveyor of gos
-1 pel truths who set a longing eye upon a
chaplainship and pulled strings in a
way wholly worldly. He visited the
lobby, which constitutes the vortex of
local politics, sat with publicans and '
sinners, smoked a pipe as he sat, and |
\ all this on Sunday. I suppose this
didn't do him any good, for he missed !
the snap he was after, and served him
rightly. High-grade morals are not '
expected of the politician, but neither 1
is a preacher expected to be a politi
cian.
Charles Wesley Kyle was made
Clerk of the Assembly, for he had well
earned the place. It was offered to
i him, and his attitude when, for a mo
; ment there seemed to be danger of his
losing it, made him more friends than
! ever. He simply declined to buttonhole
I anybody or make a plea. The result
| was that five Assemblymen, struck by
this unwonted course, ended by but
tonholing him and carrying out the
original plan.
In the Senate this afternoon I noticed
two men. One was General Dickinson,
who is a striking and familiar figure,
and the other Charles Shortrldge, sit
ting low in his seat, modest as a violet.
On the whole the Senate is a dignified
and sensible looking body. I cannot
imagine it voting for such an unholy
accident as Dan Burns.
There was a vocal tumult in the Gold- I
en Eagle to-night. George Knight
and his thinking lungs had arrived. !
Mr. Knight announced that he was a
candidate. There was really necessity
for him to do so, for people seemed
to have forgotten it. There Is reason !
to suppose that Knight is serious but
even his friends, fear that the Senate
and Assembly will be harder than a :
Botkin Jury to convince.
Governor Gage wears an aspect of
melancholy. The burden! of office have I
begun to weigh and he hasn't assumed
them yet. while Burns is ready to give
him the benefit of experience, so the j
cares ought to rest lightly.

PATRONAGE MAY
BRING ABOUT TROUBLE
The Belshaw Law Does Not Give
Enough to Satisfy the Law-
Makers.
CALL HEADQUARTERS. RACRA
MENTO, Jan. 2.â Patronage was the sub
ject of the Republican caucus that follow
ed 1 1 io afternoon session of the Assembly,
and patronage just at this writing bids
f;:!r to create a Republican minority In me.
House that will Join forces with the Dem
ocratic delegation in defense of the Bel
shaw law regulating and restricting leg
islative patronage.
The Belshaw law is on Hf first trial in
the present session, nnd though it has
been already wrung dry. it has produced
only $4 worth of patronage per diem to
each member, and. as it Is figured by a
majority in the caucus. S4 worth lacks
about two-thirds of being enough.
As a consequence, the ax Is out for the
Belshaw law, and there is a mighty power
behind It. Belshaw himself acknowledges
that his bill possibly has tuo great restric
tions, and that the smooth working of the
Assembly will require more employes
than it permits of; but he is not going to
stand for more than enough to do prac
tical business with. Against its annihila
tion he is prepared to make the fight of
hit- political life, and a clique of a score
of the country Republican votes of the
Assembly are with him to the, finish.
Tha San Francisco uelegatloiT, how
ever, wants to go the whole swine or
none, and no dissenting voice came out
of it:-; ranks when tho proposition was
broached yesterday in caucus. In fact the
San Francisco delegation talked the matter
over before it ever foregathered here for
the session of '89, and it arrived at the
Capitol with n prearranged plan to repeal
the law In its entirety if the votes could
be niuste.red.
The proposition was introduced in can
esterday afternoon by the patronage
committee appointed on Sunday evening.
Apparently no one was directly responsi
ble for it. and when Ihe country members
prot inquisitive no one would stand for it.
The Pun Francisco delegation, however.
pressed the proposition warmly from the
start ard only cooled off when lUlshaw
mustered his supporters and opened his
defense. After an horn's warm parley
Belshaw ogreed that the present list of at
tuchee it noi large enough for regular busi
ness purposes and said he would ugree to
a sulllcient increase t<> bring thÂ« dally
Assembly expenses under the head of rni
ployes up to H'^o per day if the San Fran
cisco crciwd would agree to not go be
yond thHt figure. The San Franciscans
would make no tacit agreement, but per
mitted the idea to circulate that they
were satisfied and in that Indefinite con
dition the matter was allowed to go over
until to-morrow morning.
Belshaw proposes to remedy the weak
spots In thÂ« law by drawing up a resolu
tion empowering the Speaker to employ
additional help in the Assembly so long
as he does not exceed $40.1 per flay. This
amount win give to the individual mem
hers a pro rata of $8 per diem instead of
$4. as under the present regulation.
The San Francisco faction, however,
i seem to be out for the good old game with
| the ceiling- the limit to its till of attaches,
and the country members are getting
their weapons ready for a hard fight
rather than placing confidence in the ap
parent acquiescence of the crowd from the
, metropolis. The only other matter con
sidered by the caucus was the selection
! of the regular officers of 'he Assembly,
| and these were made \.;th no more than
i the usual amount of fricti in.
QUICK WORK DONE"
IN THE ORGANIZATION
"CAXL HICADQr \KTERS, SAOUA
MENTO, Jan. 2.â The Legislature to-day
made a record for speed in organizing
that will I"- hard to surpass. There is no
special significance In the rush, but
result of to-day's rapid work will be the
disposal of the Senatorial contest a Week
earlier than it would have been settled
had the organization been delayed for one
day.
The rumor wpnt around for several
weeks that Burns and his touts were
seeking to delay organization ln order to
postpone the first ballot for United States
Senator until Tuesday, January 17. The
provisions regulating the election of
rnit'.d States Senators are embodied in
the Fi'deral constitution and cannot be
changed by act of the Legislature. The
Legislature now organized shall. accord-
Ing to the constitution, cast its first ballot
for I'nitfd States Senator on Tuesday,
January 10. The first ballot will be taken
in each house separately. On the follow
ing day the two nouses must ballot in
joint convention, and at least one ballot
a day shall be taken until a choice Is
made.
It transpires now that none of the Sena
torial aspirant? advocated delay. A m< m
ber of the Legislature who is non-com
mittal in his talk with reporters, but
sympathies are known to be for
Dan Burns, said to-day:
"Burns was never in favor of delaying
the organization, but he allowed reports
thru he desired delay in order to recruit his
strength to be circulated without denial.
T.ast Saturday, however, he sent word to
his friends advising them to consult the
wishes of other aspirant:--, and if the other
candidates wanted o t r " ahead and organ
ise on the first day of the session to get
ln and help them."
Tt is irobahle that Burns sent word last
Saturday night to his touts instructing
them not to Imperil his chances of holding
Gunst by hindering the organization of
the legislature.
OFFICIALS WILL GET PAY
FOR THEIR FULL TERM
CALT, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 2.â Attorney General W. F.
: Fitzgerald, just before retiring from office,
â  rendered a decision which affects every
! county and State officer in so far us their
terms of office are concerned.
The effect of the decision of the Attor
ney General is that no matter what day
of the month the first Monday- in Jan
uary falls upon the term of a State and
county official is for a full annual period,
and it cannot be curtailed or cut short by
a few days owing to the day of the month
the first Monday in January of the year
of the commencement -of â¢ the term falls
upon. .. -
For Instance. In 1595, when the State
officers who retired to-day entered office,
the llrst Monday in January fell upon the
seventh day of the month. This year,
when they retired, the first Monday fell
on the second of the month. Trie ques
tion with State Controller Colgan was,
were, the retiring officials entitled to re
ceive compensation for t lift full four
year period when they retired from office
to-day,. live days short of the four years'
service.
The Attorney General holds , that no
matter when the term of a State or coun
ty officer expires; if it he short or full, the
officer is entitled to and should receive
the full -compensation allowed him by the
statute or the constitution.
The Attorney General refers to an opin
ion â¢he gave some time ago covering the
term of office of a Superior Judge, and
states that that opinion covers the cases
of State officials. In that opinion Mr.
Fitzgerald held:
"I am of the opinion that the term of
office of a Superior Judge should be com
puted by including the first Monday of
â¢ January in which his term begins and
excluding the iirst Monday of January
when his term- expires. This computa
tion of the term of a. Superior Judge is
given -. In- the ease of the Mi reed Hank vs.
Rosentbal. :!'.i i':i!.: Section 20 of article
XX of the constitution roads: 'Six years.
the term of office prescribed by section G.
article VII, of the constitution, should be
construed to mean from and including
the first Monday of January following the
election of such Officer to and excluding
tin first Monday of January, six years
thereafter, and . that such officer is not
Entitled to payment of salary for a longer
period of time than his term of office." "
Under this decision the retiring State
officers were to-day paid to January 7.
The February warrants of the incoming
officials will be for the full monthly sal
ary, but when they retire in 190:1 their sal
ary will cease on December 31. 1932.

CHANGES IN OFFICE
AT THE CAPITAL
Board of Equalization Meets
and Organizes.
Secretary of State Curry Causes Joy
by Announcing the Namss
of His Staff.
CALL, HEADQI'ARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 2.â The State Board of
Equalisation organized at noon to-day.
Alex Brown of Calaveraa was elected
chairman and Charles M. Coglun, who I
has srrvi-ii the board efficiently for sev
eral terms, was re-elected secretary.
A. Chesebrough remained In his seat
and participated In the proceedings, his
term of office , under the law, not expiring
until his successor is elected and qualifies.
His successor would have been J. G. Ed
wards, who was elected In November, hut
whose death occurred before he could
take his office.
Various ' Opinions have been expressed as
to the legal status of the case presented
by the death of Mr. Edwards. Governor
Budd could have appointed a successor,
but has generously waived that
privilege In deference to Gov
ernor-elect Gage. It is contended
that Mr. Chesebrough could remain in
!:ls post until the election of a member in
of Mr. Edwards at the next gen
eral flection, but the friends of Mr.
Chesebrough assert that he will not hold
the office any longer than is necessary to
enable the man Governor Gage appoints
to assume office.
The best news of the day in connection
with the changes in the State Capitol to
day was the announcement by Secretary
of State Curry of bis appointments. One
of the choicest berths within his gift
is that of keeper of archives, carrying a
salary of $2000 a year. It had been gen
t-rally supposed that Mr. Curry would ap
point A. J. Rhoads, the well-known Re
publican politician, and present Public
Administrator of this county, to the
place, but the Secretary of State sprung
a surprise by naming Al Ltndley as
keeper of archives. Mr. TJndley has
b< rved in that position for some time un
der Secretary of State Brown, and he is
a popular and capable officer.
Mr. Curry named John Hoesch of San
Francisco his chief deputy, at a salary of
J24uO a year; George W. Scott of San Jose,
bookkeeper, at 12000; M. Curry of San
Francisco, recording clerk; Charles Clear
of San Francisco, recording clerk, also;
\\ . R. Stone of Sacramento, sten
ographer; James Peterson of Sonoma,
janitor; Thomas McDermott of San Fran
cisco, engineer; P. Pendergast of Hum
boldt, fireman; P. H. Kerrigan of San
Francisco, watchman: Eugene Jackson
of San Francisco, watchman: Lew Norton
ol Sonoma, watchman; Howard Cook of
San Francisco, porter; William Archibald
of Santa Cruz, porter; James Callely of
Santa Cruz, porter; A. < '. Storehouse ol
Sacramento, porter; William Wicks of
Nevada, porter; George Jennings of Xe
vada, elevator attendant. Scott and
Stone served under Secretary of State
Brown.
In the State Controller's and State Sur
veyor General's offices the old working
forces were reappointed. The changes in
the other offices have been stated at the
time they were decided upon in the
columns of The Call.
GEORGE A. KNIGHT AND

MENTO. Jan. 2.â George A. Knight ar
rived at the Golden Eagle this evening
and immediately thereupon the corridors
filled up with friends from all parts of the
.State anxious to extend greeting- to
George. Mr. Knight proceeded to his
room and there deposited his overcoat.
Returning to the corridor he proceeded to
at once launch his Senatorial candidacy.
"Am I a candidate for Senator?" said
he. "Why, of course I am. 1 announced
that three months ago. Do 1 have to do
it again. Am I going to open headquar
ters? I have a room here, and it will be
open all the time. 1 do not expect to
have the whole house, nor half of it.
Neither have i ,i million dollars, pr any
part thereof to spend, Still I am a can
didate for United States Senator just the
same. No. I do not know whether I will
get any votes or not. I came here to see
and talk with any of my friends who
might think of voting for me. and they
will have the privilege of casting their
ballots for me If they wish to, and that
is all there ia to It."
THE NEW GOVERNOR
IN A FRIENDLY MOOD
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Jan. 2.â This afternoon Gov
ernor-elect Gage called upon Senator
Bulla at his headquarters. It was about
2 o'clock and the Governor was ap
parently in a most happy mood, for as he
entered the rooms he said In his most
pleasant voice: "Is my good friend Bu'.la
at home?" ' , ,
The reply was that the Senator had
gone to his lunch. Mr. Gage, upon in
vitation, seated himself in a
chair and for half an hour he waited the
return of Bulla. During that tin
inquired about the headquarters of the
other Senatorial candidates, a
location and as to whether or not they
were visited by many
waiting for thirty minutes, and railing to
see the object of his vis:;, the Co
withdrew. He did not call upon General
Barnes .Mr. Grant or Dan Burns.
Ex -Coi.lt. ssman W. \v

Grant throiiÃ at the Golden Eagle. Mr.

This action was taken by the retiring
board last night and was ratified later at
a meeting of the now board.
The retiring board met at 11 o'clock. last
night, and realizing that it was leaving
things in an almost hopeless muddle,
magnanimously declared the further va
cation in order to let the new board gel
things in working order. The board then
adjourned sine die, amid a general .ex
change of comnliments and a mutual ad-
I miration society was held in the rooms
until about 12:20 a. m., when the new
board filed into the seats vacated by the
old.
This meeting was called to order by Su
perintendent Webster, and on motion
nominations were made and P. A.'Ber
gerot unanimously elected president, in
accordance with the caucus helu at noon.
The next action of the board brought
light a 7 to 5 combination, which evidently
intends to have things its own way.
James A. Simpson was placed in nomi
nation for secretary, but Director Stafford
objected and moved that he be required
to show references from former employ
ers. Directors Holbrook and Bells agreed
â with Mr. Stafford, saying that they had
heard ugly stories regarding the manner
in which his connection with a bank and
also an insurance (flee was seven .
Their words had little weight, however,
as a solid 7 to 5 placed Mr. Simpson In
office.
Other office employes were chosen as
follows: First assistant secretary, Charles

: third assistant. Thomas T. Atkinson: mi
i spector of buildings, George Walker;

SAN JOSE'S TREASURER
FOUND DEAD IN BED
.. SAX JOSE/ Jan. 2. âCity Treasurer J.
N. Ewing was found dead in his bed
. room at 5 o'clock this afternoon. He
â¢had not been in good health for some
time; though able to attend to his'o'ffl
' rial-duties. The discovery of his .death
was made by a married son who came
to visit him. Death in the opinion of his
physician wan due to heart disease.
Early in the afterno He # was about
town as usual.
Deceased" was a native of Indiana and
C 6 years of age. He was twice elected
"to the office of Treasurer, once as a- Re
publican and the last. time* as 'a Non-
Partisan. .
! the seriousness of the situation and has
| brought to the attention of Secretary
Lrmg the necessity of. providing his
squadron with additional light draught
gunboats, as he cabled about a month
ago. In compliance with his wishes the
department to-day ordered the gunboat
Helena, now at Naples, to proceed di
rect to Manila. The original sailing or
ders of the Helena contemplated her
dispatch to China, but the situation in
that country is now sufficiently peace
ful to warrant directing her to join
Dewey's command. . The Bennington.
which will soon be on her way to Guam,
will be attached to the Asiatic station,
and if he so desires Rear Admiral
Dewey can direct her to join him. The
gunboat Yorktown, fitting out at Mare
Island, will also probably bo Bent to
the Far East, and the gunboat Wheel- ]
ing may also join the Asiatic squadron.
Rear Admiral Dewey wants light
draught gunboats in order that they
may penetrate the shallow bays and !
riven of the Philippines and assist the
military in preserving peace and order.
Major General Otis" dispatches, it â 
was stated to-day, do not show the j
situation in the Philippines to be as i
serious as do newspaper reports, but j
it is admitted that the condition of
affairs is exceedingly "grave.

COMPLAINS OF THE
ABUSES IN ALASKA
Bishoo Nicholas of the Greek Church Sets
Forth Grievances in a Letter to
the President.
DR. SHELDON JACKSON, United States General Agent for
' Education In Alaska.
Xi: W.YORK, Jan. 2.â Bishop Nicholas of the orthodox Greek church
has addressed a letter to President McKinley relating to certain abuses in
Akiska, in which he says:
"Alaska stands in need of radical reform in all directions. A limit must
be set to the abuses of various companies, more especially of the Alaska
Commercial Company, which for over thirty wn has had the uncontrolled
management of affairs and has reduced the country's hunting: and fishing
resources to absolute exhaustion, and the population to bee-eary and semi
starvation. A limit must be set to the abuses of officials who, as shown by
the experience of many years, are sent there without any discrimination
and excluÂ«fve!y on the recommendation of Alaska's irremovable guardian,
Sheldon Jackson. And lastly, Alaska must be delivered from that man. By
his sectarian propaganda he has introduced dissension, enmity and iniquity
where those evils did not before exist. It was the orthodox church which
brought the light of truth to that country; why, then, try to drive her out
of it by every means lawful or unlawful?
"In the name of humanity, of justice and freedom â of those very fcless
ings for the sake of which you declared war against Spain â I make these
requests. Will you be acting consistently if, while waging war for the lib
erty .of Cuba, Porto Rico and the Philippines for their human rights, you
ignore all these things at home, in part of your own country which has been
waiting thirty years for the blessings promised to it? And are not we Rus
sians fully entitled to demand of you for Alaska that for which you have
taken up arms against Spain? t
"The only thing that may possibly be brought up against us is that we
profess the true faith, and have not yet divested ourselves of our sympathies
for Russia, the land of our own faith. But is that really sufficient ground
for blame and persecution? There is no danger whatever in that to Amer
ican rule in Alaska, as some persons would probably have you believe, if
only for the reason that our church never meddles in politics and our clergy
never busied itself at home or abroad with intrigues."
THE SAN FBANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 3, 1899.
Government and disprove the reports,
which, it is believed, were put in ctrÂ«"
lation by Spaniards, that the United
States purposes to treat them bruuuiy
and deprive them of any voice in the
affairs of the island. It is the general
feeling in administration circles that
before General Ri<>s surrendered Iloilo
to the insurgents he caused reports to
be circulated among; the latter that the
Americans had no intention of keeping
the promises which they were making.
It is due to this perfidious action, it is
thought, that the insurgents declined
to surrender the city to General Miller
when requested to do so.
The department thoroughly approves
General Otis' action in sending a repre
sentative to Iloilo to confer with the
insurgents. There is no disposition to
supersede General Miller, and his ac
tion in declining to await communica
tion between the insurgents and Aguin
aldo is approved, but it is thought ad
visable that force shall be avoided as
long as possible.
Diplomacy is being employed by the
administration in the hope that the in
surgents will come to an appreciation
of the friendly purposes of this Govern
mptit. Tinder instructions sent yester
day General Otis will use every effort
to bring Aguinaldo's followers to a
realization of the desire of this Govern
ment to establish a beneficent govern
ment in the Philippines. The adminis
tration does not want to flÂ«rht the in
surgents. Tt Is appreciated, however,
that Aguinaldo is a sullen, stubborn
l^ndr-r and it is not intended to give him
too long a rope.

SOCIETY WITNESSES POLO RACES IN THE MUD.
SAN MATEO, Jan. 2.â The going was
very bad at Walter Hobart's racing
course to-day, and that is why the San
Mateo Hunting Club voted to-night for a
hammam bath at the club's expense.
The races, five in number, were sched
uled for 1 p. m., with or without rain.
Blingum had received a solar plexus the
day before when the polo game was post
poned on account of the weather and con
sequently was much annoyed. The track
was everything it should not have been
for gentlemen riders. Mud of that in
sistent variety, mucilaginous and pasty,
was the prominent feature, and after the
races, when the riders had assimilated
three tons of it, seemingly just as much
was left.
According to the stipulated agreement
each pony was to carry 170 pounds. But

and ended with Charley Dunphy oh Nel
lie, Walter Hobart on Duke and Harry
Poett on Baked Beans inside the money
and mud. Never was there so much mud
slinÃing practiced before by society's di
rectors, and the crust of slime leveled all
to the same plane. The second race, a
full half mile, was Joe Tobin's in a can
navigation. The commission had long
considered the plan of constructing a
vast debris dam at the narrows oT the
Yuba, above Smartsville. Investiga
tion by engineers has developed, how
ever, that the deposits of debris in the
bed of that river at the point named
average a depth of sixty-five feet. In
asmuch as only a bedrock dam would
guarantee a . safe barrier for the im
pounding of debris from the mines lo
cated upon the stream and Its moun
tain feeders, the commission gave up
the dam project as impracticable, or at
least as unlikely to give corresponding
value for the enormous sum necessary
to erect it in a substantial manner.
The Yuba is constantly carrying
â  i Jlwi â nl til tVnÂ» TIV-j tVi<Â»Â«- n:honw >*
washes into the Sacramento, impairing
navigation on both the latter streams.
To prevent this descent of the millions
of yards of movable debris and at the
same time enable hydraulic mining to
be resumed on the Yuba and its tribu
taries in the mountains is the purpose
of the plan now nroposed by the com
mission. This provides for the diver
sion of the Yuba near the edfe of the
foothills a few miles below Smartsville.
The stream with its quanties of sedi
ment would be carried from this point
in a canal 200 feet in width, of adequate
depth, along the south side of the Yuba,
running southwesterly toward Reed's
Creek. The canal with its strong levees
would gradually widen until it opened
into a storage basin several miles in
width and about fifteen miles in length.
The stora"" area thus afforded would
be capable of receiving . hundreds of
millions of cubic yards of debris from
the mines. The water will not bÂ«>
stored, but will now away into the
basin of the Bear and Feather rivers,
practically freed from sediment, so as
to be harmless to the streams below.
Surveys for the canal and storage
basin have been made, but estimates
remain to be calculated. It is believed
that the execution of this project will
relieve Marysville from maintaining
levees along the Yuba. while it would
grant immense relief to the farming
community opposite thfÂ»+ place and re
move one of the main sources of the
sediment which is constantly settling in
the Sacramento River and threatening
the navigability of that stream.

wire was passed Tobin smiled and the
cake of mud which h^lmeted his head
cracked and dropped, spattering all ovef

Hume and Poctt finished second and third.
The third race was the same as the
second, with a quarter of a mile more of
mud and added thre<: new faces among
the finishers. William Page, who had
been reserving his strength, finished first,
Dunphy second and Tobin third. The
fourth race gave Harry Poett the prize

their masters that the next race had to

Senators Sewell and Cockrell, both of
whom have been sick for two weeks or
more, and Senator Allison, who has the
grip and is keeping his room to avoid
more serious conseauences.
Senator Turpie of Indiana is recover

c SINGULAR DISPARITY.
A' IRDING to a. morning newspaper a lobby :
ist having in hand at the last session of the
lature the famous Assembly Bill .273 â a
;urc whichi it was -charged, proposed to interfere
with the I . â  >rcross suit, tlicn pending in Judge
Hebbard's department of the Superior Courtâ .paid
. â  votes in the Senate : and $.250 apiece
for votes in the Assembly. According to the same
authority these amounts sufficed to pass' the bill; that
is, a sufficient number of votes were purchased in
each ' â  I the figures named to send it to the
Governor.
We do not refer to this matter for the purpose of
disputing the statement of our contemporary. On the
contrary, we arc free . ai we think in all prtob
assertion-s are ' upon fact. As we
recall the history of Assembly Bill 273 it possessed
all the earmarks of a fraud. It was backed by a lobby
and its enactment was desired by a millionaire seek
ing to esca] his just liabilities in one of the courts.
It is not without the ran.cc of probability to conceive
that in his fray â¢ ts to get his c out of Heb
bard's hands â who had decided against himâ the lat
1* > <-Â., v ;j, _^..,. . . j !â .â â¢! anuiuL.j'Â°B f< > r
as well as for lobby's fe< -.
Hut the point which has struck iis as singular is
this; Why should Senators gej $500 for their vol
and Assemblymen only SJSO? Is it because there are
twice as many Senators as Assemblymen? Is it be
cause it costs more to get to the Senate than to
to the Assembly? Arc Senators better talkers, clev
erer manipulators, deeper thinkers, better financier-.
or nmre skillful in the art of selling their votes? On
what ground is the tariff referred to based? The cost
Senatorial voles is apparently double that of As
sembly votes. There must be some explanation of
disparity.
Every intelligent person knows that none of the
questions we have propounded can be answered in
the affirmative. The tariff for Senatorial' support is
fixed by the size of.,the House, nor by the cost <
â â . nor because Senators are smarter than
mblymen, nor because they are greater adepts in
fair price for their votes. We do not know
why votes in the upper' house should cost double as
much as in the lo.ver. but we are morally certain that
the fact is not due to any of these causes. How.
then, is the disparity to be accounted' for?
That it ought to be accounted for is undeniable. As
things are going all the boodlers are making for the
Senate and in the course of time there will in conse
quence be none in the Assembly.' This will be in the
nature of a calamity. Without boodlers in the.Assem
bly there will be nothing for the corporation lobbyists
0, and they will naturally turn to burglary, pick
ing pockets, footpadding and the other unlawful oc
cupations for which their peculiar talents fit them. In
the meantime our contemporary should ascertain why
votes in the Senate bring $506 and in the Assembly
only $250. ('.-in it be possible that these figures rep
' principle of all the traffic will bear? If
the fact should be established.
NOT CITY EDITOR WARREN.
IM MAKING an expose of the methods of betray
mg trust practiced by' the telephone company
there was occasion to allude to the city editor of j
the Examiner as party to the fraud. â¢ In justice to '
Mr. Warren, the present city editor of that paper, The j
(a " that no reference was had to him.
This the gentleman himself understands, arid, so do
all the newspaper men of the State, but the truth
might not l)c blear to the general public. In view
of possible confusion this explanation, being a simple
matter of justice, i- gladly made.
While to permit Wi'dber. to make a farewell tour '
oi the tenderloin ana indulge in- a finalspree may
have been kind, it was a plan rtot to be regarded as j
a precedent. A prisoner must ordinarily submit to
the hardship of sobriety, and perhaps it is better thus.
By the way. how did it happen, that the President
sent congratulations to the peace commission and I
never a word to the yellow journals who had so ;
firmly and yet so modestly conducted the war to a
successful end?
The gentleman selected by Judge Treadwell.to act
as bailiff of his court has had the misfortune to blast
his chances of an official career. It is tobe hoped the j
Judge may find another as good or even better than
an ex-convict of homicidal tendencies.
If a woman really cannot keep a secret she will
naturally feel sympathy for the telephone company.
A message of condolence flitting either way be
tween Burns and Quay would be timely.
Yesterday was a holiday at Sacramento, too, but j
the people up there seemed mostly to forget it
COL. DAN BURNS CONFESSES HIS
CfINDIDfJCY.
AT LAST Dan Burns has declared himself a can
didate for the United States Senate. He issued
the proclamation yesterday. If designed to
create a wave of enthusiasm, it failed abjectly. If
meant to surprise, it fell equally short of its purpose.
That Burns had long been a candidate was known to
the people of this State. It had been known so far
back as when Burns, having secured the confidence
of Editor de Young, was engaged in gilding a brick
for presentation to that gentleman.
The only doubt arose from the difficulty of compre
hending how a man of repute so unsavory, with so
lengthened a record of trusts betrayed, of friendships
sordidly abused, could have the measureless effrontery
to assume an attitude which would certainly lay bare
to the world his personal history. Instead of seeking
official honors, such a man, unless within him lay
dead all sense of decency, would rather court oblivion
and pray to be forgot.
When suspicion of his real intent became a certain
ty, some journals, including the Call, felt that an ex
posure of the Burns character was a duty, and while
1 the facts presented were not new, some of them had
grown dim in the general recollection. For the ne
cessity of refreshing the memory of the people Burns
is alone to blame. For him to pose as a martyr is
simply for him to be ridiculous, yet he poses as a
martyr and fancies that a halo bedecks him. Burns
asserts that his good name has been taken from him.
He errs in that he had no good name of which to be
j deprived. Years ago he deliberately threw it to the
winds of scandal-. Now he laments that it is gone, and
for his own fault blames those whose only relation to
j the. matter has been to tell the truth. He begs for
sympathy. His soul pines for a vindication, and this
he fancies can be secured only by election to the
; United States Senate. He wants California to send
: him to Washington, to throw over his past, for which
he has never expressed contrition, the mantle of char
ity, and to give him credentials as a trusted agent in
one of the high places of the nation. There could not
well be a presumption mr>re impudent and monstrous.
It is an insult to the commonwealth.
: California cannot afford to choose as Senator a
man who is still indebted to it in the sum of $31,000
for money stolen from it while he was Secretary of
State. ' With all his millions, Burns has never offered
to make restitution. If he has experienced the emo
tion of regret, he has refrained from expressing it. If,
since .that, wanton misdeed, he has acquired a new set
cf principles they have not been made manifest by
any change of conduct. He carried into private life
the same code of morality which had shadowed his
public career with disgrace. And now this man asks
that a vindication be given him, and given in such a
manner that the State, which has suffered through
rum, smtre â mm: mm : me iicimHt-uJ - aiium-c. â TtiJu
would be more than forgiveness, it would be folly.
It would be the extending of a reward to the trans
gressor who had escaped punishment, condoning an
offense for which the offender had not requested for
giveness.
California wants a Senator who can represent its
best interests and its manhood. It does not want a
person of the Burns stripe. There is upon it no obli
gation to "vindicate" any rogue, and a vindication
which involves the bestowal of honors which worthy
men would be glad to receive would carry too far the
spirit of turning the other cheek. The most that
i Burns could reasonably expect would be to be undis-
I turbed as he goes about his ordinary vocations, and
j his qualities unheralded. If he projects himself into a
1 "fierce light" it is not logical that he should shy at the
misshapen silhouettes it casts.
TELEPHONE EAVESDROPPING.
BY the disclosures made in The Call on Sunday
concerning the manner in which spies and
eavesdroppers obtain information from the
telephone wires there was laid before the people of
San Francisco one of the most serious outrages
against honor, private rights and business honesty
that has ever been committed in the history of the
country. It is an outrage which affects all classes of
citizens and even invades the privacy of home life
and the confidences of husband and wife, since the
spying eavesdroppers who contrive to tap the tele
phones to learn the affairs of business rivals arc sure
to tap them also when they desire to gratify a sneak
ing curiosity concerning any individual or family.
A- was explained on Sunday, The Call was led to
undertake an investigation of the subject by the fact
that a telephone message from one of its reporters
was betrayed to the Examiner. Starting from the
discovery of that offense The Call traced the iniquity
out and discovered that an habitual system of eaves
dropping is practiced by that paper through the me
dium of telephone wires. Three decoy conversations
carried on between The Call and different people were
betrayed to the listening spy in the Examiner, and
other evidences showing the extent to which the ras
cally practice is carried were discovered.
Of course, anything like a complete exposure is
impossible. It will never be known to what extent
the telephone company has permitted the sneaks of
the Examiner office to listen to conversations over its
wires. It suffices to say that no one is safe in con
versing by telephone in this city. The eavesdrop
per is listening continually and has an ear for the pri
vate talk of families as well as for that of politics and
business.
A prompt remedy is needed for the outrage. A
iaw making this betrayal of confidence as gross an
offense as that of breaking open a private letter should
be enacted, and for the sneaking eavesdropper there
should be a *:erm in penitentiary.
Of course, owing to the absence of Mr. Hearst the
evacuation ceremony at Havana was a little slow, but
under the circumstances it went off as well as could
have been expected.
Senator Hanna need feel no alarm at the threat of
death conveyed in an anonymous letter. The writer
of such a missive is before all else a coward.
One discouraging circumstanc. the chaplains of
both houses must face is that some of their auditors
are beyond praying for.
THE SAN FRANCISCO C A Lay TUESDAY, JANUARY 3, 1899.
Th|E RAILROAD'S BOD FfHTM-
T~^ EFORE the election the railroad swore by all
\\ the gods at once that it was out of politics. Its
asseverations were so loud and so constant that
it was almost painful to hear them. They were ap
parently so sincere that they were implicitly believed.
It is now feared that its pledges were false and that
its disguises have been thrown aside.
Whether Dan Burns be a candidate for the United
States Senate in reality or for the benefit of some
other person equally acceptable to the railroad and
less obnoxious to the public, a question is presented
which every Republican in the Legislature should re
gard as of vital importance. That question is
whether the choice for President so far as this State
is concerned shall be treacherously turned over to
the Democratic party in 1900. Unless a Senator be
chosen who is at least negatively respectable and who
will represent the railroad only as part of his con
stituency, Republican defeat in 1900 is certain. Every
legislator who contributed to that defeat would sound
his own political death knell. There is no escape from
this proposition. Only the sensational press assumes
the unrecognized right of dictating to courts or to
legislative bodiest which, within their proper limits,
should be firmly upheld in unrestricted independence
of thought and of action. There are many Republi
cans who would do no discredit to the Senate of the
United States â some by whom that body would be
honored â and every right-thinking man, whatever his
individual opinion, should be satisfied with the selec
tion of one of them by the unfettered action of the
Republican majority in the Assembly and the Sen
ate. But there are two elementary facts upon which
it is right to insistâ that the elected Senator be, first,
competent; second, respectable. It cannot be pre
tended that either of these conditions is met by Dan
Burns, or by any other candidate to whom his in
fluence is likely to be transferred.
Of late years, and especially since the somewhat
general adoption of the Australian ballot, the voters
of the United States have exhibited marked inde
pendence and discrimination, as was strikingly proved
in the elections of 1898. Throughout the Union
stump oratory and the alternate wheedling and bully
ing of newspapers like the Journal-Examiner had
very little weight. In this State the ranting of the
fusionists against corporations and property and in
favor of proletarian Democracy produced the exact
effect that was not anticipated. The voters exercised
their instructed and balanced judgments, and they
overwhelmingly demonstrated their aversion to free
silver at sixteen to one and to all the other grotesque
and un-American features of the fusion platform.
Thus they vindicated the principle of popular sov
ereignty.
But there is one thing they did not do. They did
not hand the State over to the Southern Pacific Com
pany in order that it might choose a Senator for its
own benefit and to enable Mr. William F. Herein,
himself a Democrat, to beat the Republican party in
1900. That is a trick which the higher class Demo
crats of California and of the Union would themselves
be the first to expose and to condemn. All through
the late canvass in the Republican press and on the
stump the assurance was definite and constant that
the railroad was out of politics, and it was indignantly
and repeatedly denied that its deft hand had moved
the Republican State convention or any county, dis
trict or municipal convention. The truth undoubted
ly is that no vote more expressive of the deepest sen
timents of the people was ever cast in all our history.
11 it should terra our mat any wf tlie offWt.ro elected,
municipal or State, executive, judicial or legislative,
were secretly railroad tools, then the public and the
press were grossly and wantonly deceived. While
falsehood is now virtually confessed by the railroad,
so far as the legislators themselves are concerned the
presumption is that they were not parties to the decep
tion and that they are beyond corporate dictation
and, therefore, beyond the power of Dan Burns and
his associates.
The Southern Pacific Company has a right to fair
treatment, which it has not always received, but to
nothing more. If it now seeks to force the election
of a Federal Senator, owned by itself, and should
succeed, confidence in the Republican party will be
locally destroyed. This would be the fact, even if the
man himself were of fair standing, and doubly the
fact if a name should be put forward that stinks in
the nostrils of decency. Surely the Southern Pacific
Company itself, embracing as it does so many gentle
men identified with the solid interests of the country,
does not really imagine that it can falsify its own
pledges, and by brutal coercion and by coarse brib
ery compel the election of Dan Burns or his substi
tute through the representatives of a free and inde
pendent American constituency? Can it be possible
that it has readied such an exaltation of self-import
ance that it proposes to substitute itself for the
legislative department of the Government, and, in the
name of the State, appoint Dan Burns or some one
like him as its agent at Washington? If this condi
tion of inebriety exist it demands correction, and we
have faith to believe that correction will be adminis
tered by the Legislature, not only from policy, but
on the higher ground of principle. If the State Re
publican organization should be smashed into pulp
through an unprecedented betrayal of the people and
violation of definite pledges, a responsibility would
be incurred that even the railroad could hardly bear.
There would be a political revolution in California.
The same weight of public sentiment that crushed
Bryanism in 1896 and fusion in 1898 and held all
human rights, including property, whether of individ
uals or corporations, within the equal protection of
the constitution and the laws, will smash the railroad
power if it attempts to usurp the Government. And
the next lesson it receives will not be from cranks,
fanatics or self-seekers, but from the conservative and
solid elements of the public. Our people will not
tolerate, after an election, the cold repudiation of
promises made before an election. The merchants,
the bankers, the manufacturers, the farmers, the
tradesmen, the mechanics and the laborers of Cali
fornia united in one grand and successful effort to
overthrow whnt they conceived to be a revolutionary
I attack upon our institutions, but they made no bar
j gain to accept Dan Burns or his equivalent as their
Federal leader or to help the railroad in schemes of
I self-aggrandizement or revenge. They insist that the
I Republican pledges shall be kept and that property
and franchises, as well as personal liberty, shall be
safeguarded by public officers yielding allegiance ex
clusively to the source whence their authority is de
rived.
For obvious reasons the Examiner will never
effectively resist corruption in the choice of a Federal
Senator and an audacious attempt to seduce the Leg
islature into the temporary disruption of the Repub
lican party in this State naturally commands its in
direct support and also that of its tender, the Bulletin,
but it will be resisted by The Call and, as we are glad
to observe, by the Chronicle also, and by other lead
ing Republican papers and committees. It is hardly
to be supposed that a combination between the rail
road and the baser elements of the Democracy can
be sanctioned by legislators fresh from their constit
uents and with the taste of their solemn pledges still
remaining in their mouths. .
APPOINTEES
OF RAILROAD
COMMISSION
Will Probably Be
Named To-Day.
ANNUAL REPORT SUBMITTED
HUNTINGTON CRITICIZED AS A
WITNESS.
Valley Road Will Solve the Fare and
Freights Question â
Adopted on Stanton's
Death.
Contrary to the announcement, the new
Board of Railroad Commissioners, con
sisting of N. Blaekstoek, E. B. Edson and
C. S. Laumeister, did not organize yes
terday, the reason assigned being that it
was a holiday. It was thought best to
defer this work until to-day, for which
purpose the new board will come together
at 10 a. m.
There are three patronage positions in
the gift of the three members, and ac
cording to reliable reports, the appointees
have already been selected. W. S. Sesnon,
ex-County Clerk of San Francisco, is Elat
ed for the- secretaryship, Mr. Foley, a
relative of Commissioner Laumeister, is
to be the bailiff of the board, and James
D. Brown will in all probability be the
stenographer, though he has a rival in
Stephen Potter, the stenographer of the
old board.
It is also the announced purpose of the
new board to move from the present
quarters of the commission in the Chron
icle building, owing to lack of room.
The members of the old board, com
prising H. M. La Rue, W. M. Hinton and
W. R. Clark, have hied their final report
with the Governor. It is a voluminous
document and rills nearly 120 typewritten
pages. In the course of reviewing the
board's work for the year Just past, the
report says in regard to Its efforts to re
duce grain rates 8 per cent in the State:
We regret to have to state the case of the
Southern Pacific Company against*the Board
of Railroad Commissioners, restraining it from
carrying Into effect the schedule adopted re
ducing grain rates 8 per cent Is still pending
in the Circuit Court of the United States.
Testimony is being taken before Master
in Chancery Heacbck. It is claimed by
some of the members of the old board
that the past year should show, by rea
son of increased earnings, such profits for
the railroad as will make it legally pos
sible to make the sought for reduction.
Tribute is paid in the report to the high
qualities of C. P. Huntington as an art
ful dodger of disagreeable questions. He
was before the commission in connection
with its investigation of the Southern Pa
cific Company. The opinion expressed is
that of Commissioners La Rue and Hin
ton, Commissioner Clark having de
murred to having it incorporated In the
: report of the board. These are the
words of the commission:
Mr. Collls P. Huntington appeared before the
commission May 2, lisas, and was examined
from day to day until May 16, 1898. His an
swers were characterized by that persistent
evasion which has always been the leading
feature of his testimony alika before courts,
commissions and Congressional committees.
Mr. Huntingdon proved to be a very remarkable
wltnens. Upon all questions affecting the con
struction of railroads, their physical condition,
when built, and by whom, he was very famil
iar and well informed, but on the original cost
of construction, the value of stocks, the pres
ent value of roads, upon which we desired in
formation, his memory was very poor, and his
knowledge of. but little Importance to us.
High appreciation of the economic value
to the State of the Valley road is shown
in the report as follows:
The San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley
Railroad has extended its lines through the
San Joaquin Valley to Bakersfleld, and at the
present time has Its engineers surveying from
tstookton to Oakland, which, when completed,
will be of great benefit to the shippers and
growers on tha line of said road, and will, In
a great measure, regulate the question of fix
ing fares and freight rates.
After reviewing the proceedings which
resulted in failure to Investigate the af
fairs of the Southern Pacific Company on
the complaint of John R. Robinson, and
to regulate fares on street railways, the
report concludes with a memorial on the
death of Dr. James 1. Stanton as follows:
It is with profound regret and sorrow
we record In this repurt the death of
one of tha members of this board, Jamea
I. Btanton, who died in his home in San
Fraiiois.'o on December 28, 1897.
The exalted character and distin
guished services of the deceased appro
priately demand the highest recognition.
No member who has served the State and
who has contributed to the efficiency of
this commission has left a deeper Impress
or a larger place In the hearts of the peo
ple. His example will Inspire other men
to strive to emulate the performance of
noble deeds for the benefit of mankind
In all positions, official or otherwise,
he was ever helpful to the needy and un
fortunate. His place will be hard to fill
As a member of this board he was
above reproach, his every act being char
acterised by ability and high minded zeal
for that which is right. Hlb aim was al
ways to allay, so far as possible, differ
ences between complainants and the rail
roads -without litigation. Every one with
whom he came In contact admired the
tender-hearted man, and It was frequent-,
ly said of him that he did nÂ»Â» have an
enemy. He was a man of strong convic
tions, his ways were the ways of friend
ship and his words were words of kind
ness.
Dr. James I. Stanton was born In the
city of San Francisco on the 20th day of
May, 1860, where his boyhood days were
passed, until his entrance to St. Ignatius
College, where the foundation of his early
education was laid. He then entered Santa
Clara College, and. after the usual course
of studies, graduated with high honorÃ in
1679.
Young Mr. Stanton selected the medical
profession as his future vocation, and
pursued a course of studies In the medical
department of the University of Califor
nia, whence he graduated and received his
diploma in the year 1882.
Dr. Stanton's first public office was that
of physician to the San Francisco Fire
Department, where, in the display of con
scientious attention to his duties, ha en
deared himself to all.
, He was elected Coroner of San Fran
cisco In 1888. After fulfilling the duties of
this office for the term for which he waa
chosen he retired to private life, from
which he waa again called to public life
by Mayor L. R. Ellert, who honored him
by conferring the appointment of Super
visor of the Third ward of San Fran
cisco upon him. During his incumbency
of the office of Supervisor, Dr. Btanton
â was again honored by his fellow citizens
by being elected to the position of Rail
road Commissioner of the Second District
of this State, which office he was filling at
the time of his decease.
His generous, genial, cheerful, loving
nature endeared him to all. Socially and
?.s a friend of the people In ail walks of
lfe, with almost paternal kindness, he
won the hearts of his acquaintances and
associates. His loss to the State is ir
reparable and 1b keenly felt by his asso
ciates on the board.
"He rests from his labors and his works
do follow him."
Among the matters left for the new
board to complete is the investigation of
the affairs of the Pullman Car Company,
with a view to reducing Its charges for
sleepers In this State.
Mog-an Holds the Fort.
Thomas F. Graham will take his seat
this morning in one of the courtrooms
as Police Judge. In anticipation of a
flank movement on Graham's part Judge
Mogan was on guard yesterday afternoon
at his courtroom, but no movement was
made by the enemy. There may be
trouble this morning.
Stricken With Apoplexy.
Fred Burress, a ship liner, fell dead yes
torlay afternoon at the corner of Broad
way and Davis streets, presumably from
apoplexy. He was a native of Kansas
about 55 years old, and was the father-in
law of Patrick Stevens, driver of the Cal
ifornia-street station patrol wagon.

NEVER FIGHT IN THE OPEN.
If anybody thinks the people of Cali

them in the Senate at Washington, will
he please rise up and give the reason

DANIEL MAZUMA BURNS.
It would seem as though the particu

Examiner for United States Senator is
Colonel Daniel Mazuma liurns of Mex
ico. â Sacramento Bee.
BURNS AND BRIBERY.
The bribery methods being used at
Sacramento by the Burns gang to se
cure the Senatorial votes are so open
and shameless that it may be said to be
a certainty that if a legislator votes
for Burns or his substitute that legis
lator has been paid for his trouble. The
people of California do not want a man
of the Burns stripe to represent the
State in the national Senate, neither do
they care for men who are open to pur
chase in the State Legislature.âOcean
side Weekly Blade.
DISHONEST AND DISGRACEFUL.
The present Senatorial situation in
California is one that will cause an in
creased desire for the election of United
States Senators by direct vote of the
people. The State is now threatened
with the election of Dan Burns to the
honorable office of Senator. Mr. ISurns'
career as a public man has been such
a dishonest and disgraceful one that he
would never dare to ask for an office
which is filled by direct vote; but owing
to the present indirect method of elec
tion for Senator we are in danger of
having our State represented in the
highest lawmaking body of the land by
a man in whom we have no confidence
and who is regarded as unfit for a posi
tion of trust.â FallbrooK Observer.
BURNS AND THE NEWSPAPERS.

f SAZARAC CLUB f President High-
A cricr.rrn.trNC- X balls as he call
f SUSPENDS ied the Sazarac
<j> TWO MEMBERS, i Lying Club to or- |
I I der, "that two
â â¬>â â â â â <$ â $> members of this
organization were guilty of un- !
seemly conduct on Saturday night." i
Mr. Thaddeus Tomwaddy, the politician, i
and Mr. Clear Havana, the cigar manu
facturer, both prominent members of the
club, looked sheepishly at each other as
President Highballs made his startling
announcement. Mr. Tomwaddy*s right
arm reposed in a sling, while the left op
tic of Mr. Clear Havana was as black as
the shine on his patent leathers and
tightly closed.
"I am reliably Informed by Sergeant
Michael Joseph Conboy," continued the
President, "that Messrs. Tomwaddy and
Clear Havana enjoyed a ride to the City
Hall at 1 o'clock on Sunday morning as a
result of a little joke that they carried
too far. The sergeant says that at the
time the identity of the two gentlemen
was unknown to him. He further stated
that they both showed a decided disin
clination to enjoy a ride at the city's ex
pense, and that the little argument that
he had with the gentlemen while assist
ing them into the patrol wagon resulted
in some little damage to their persons."
Here the president paused and looked at
the two members in question.
"Well," said Mr. Clear Havana, "I sup
pose it is of no use trying to get out of it.
and If it is any pleasure to the club I !
will relate how it happened. On Saturday j
afternoon that confounded old pirate, |
Tomwaddy, came to me and proposed
that we should join the crowd on Market
street that night. I did not want to go, j
but he Insisted. He said that wo w-*re :
getting old, that we were too much ab
sorbed in business affairs, and that the
little outing would do us good. He pro
posed that in order not to be recognized
we should hire two disguises and black
our faces. After much persuasion I con
sented. Tomwaddy there he rigged himself
up as George Washington, whllo I was
supposed to be the Apostle Paul. We
started out about 11 o'clock. Of course i
we attracted considerable attention, but
we did not mind that, and all might have
gone well if Tomwaddy hadn't insisted I
on buying a horn and blowing it in other I
people's ears. About midnight we struck
a water front gang and all of them were
sailing along on a full tide. When they
passed us that old pirate blew his horn
in the ear of one of the gang. The fellow |
turned around and invited Tomwaddy to j
go where he has a good chance of going \
anyway.
"One word led to another, and the first
thing I knew one of the gang knocked off
Tomwaddy's cocked hat, then another
Jerked off the beard I had rented and
caned me an old stiff. I went at him,
and in the shuffle I lost my robe and san
dals. Tomwaddy tried to get out of his I
general's uniform, but somebody jerked
the tails of the coat over his head, tear
ing off his wig and splitting the coat up
the back. Just then along came the ser
geant and arrested us. Tomwaddy was as
mad as a wet hen.
" 'Do you know who I am?' ho roared '
at Conboy.
" 'Cert; you and that guy pard of yours j
are two of the toughest coons in the city,
and I have been looking for a chance to
nab you.' I told him our names, and
Conboy Bald we couldn't give him no such
'con' as that. Then the patrol came and
"attacking" him. This is. really quite
amusing. Dan Burns in the rule of an
injured innocent is something- for gods
and men to smile at. However it may
be with the gods, men throughout Cali
fornia will smile broadly, not to say
audibly.
But Dan Burns, in noint of fact, is
attacked, not by the newspapers, but
by his record! The newspapers, in
showing up his unsavory record, are
simply telling the plain truth about
him as it is their duty to do. If the
plain truth hurts Mr. Hums, that fact
is Mr. Burns' misfortune. He has no
right to blame the newspapers for it.
He should, rather, blame himself for bo
conducting his affairs as to. gain a rep
utation which is an offense in the nos
trils of decency.
If Mr. Burns were an honest manâ if
his record w r ere free from stainâ he
would have nothing to fear from the
newspapers. His record, if it were cred
itable to him, rather .than otherwise.
would not suffer from publicity, it
would rather benefit him to have the
facts made known. The newspapers
can neither defeat nor injure an honest
man, whose record, public and- private,
is all right. Such a man can defy all
adverse influences. But Dan Burns is
I not such a man.
Dan Burns rests under conviction for
a serious crime committed In the repub
lic of Mexico, for which he was once
Imprisoned, and for which he would
again be imprisoned if ne dared to m i
foot on M< xican soil.
There is a shortage of pome $5000 in
Burns' accounts as County Clerk -of
Vol., County, California, which is still
i unaccounted for.
There is a shortage of some $30,000 in
Rums' accounts as Secretary of State,
; which has never as yet been made (rood.
Burns is known throughout the State
as a notorious gambler, patron of horse
races and all-around sport.
Burns is Involved in the voting ma
! chine scandal, by which an attempt w ; as

c a voting machine which has no
| existence in point of fact, no such ma

For a man with such a record to com
plain that he has been "attacked" by
. the press is simply laughable. His com
i plaint is about a? reasonable as that of

they just jammed us into it. When we
prqt to the City jmll and grit the. Mark
off our faces the police recognized us and
let us go."
Here Mr. Tomwaddy spoke up. "Yes,
! that is how it occurred, and you can bet
: that I have done with New Year celebra
tion. That George Washington uniform
| cost me $2U and I wouldn't have sprained
- this arm of mine for a hundred." Both

Peattle scooped in another victory yes
terday afternoon, the Oaklands being tho
Victims by a score <-,f to 7. The, game
was played under unfavorable conditions,
as the ground was wet and slippery from
the rain, which fell almost from the call
of time. In the last halt of the fifth Um
pire McDonald ordered the players in
out of the wet, but the downpour cased
up for a few minutes and play was re
eurm.-d. Manager Doyle's aggregation of
balltosscrs took kindly to the damp, while
the 1 iklandera seemed unable to either
hit the ball- when hits wera needed or
ho]d it when necessary to score a put out.
Tho. .men from the north played the better
fielding . line, notably "Talks'" Parrott,
who was invincible at first, hauling down
everything that came 'within reach and
blighting the hopes of "opponents on
numerous occasions when much-needed
funs and victory seemed' almost in their
grasp; â¢ '.', '. â  â¢
'.The Oaklands were first . at bat, and
started off at a winning gait, scoring
twice.. ln the first, and three times In the
eecrmd. Then they fell down and' were
unabl-e to get another run across the
plate until the eighth, when they scored
two runs after the first two men up had
been retired. They needed one more run to
tie- the score, but failed tor connect, al
though they made a final desperate effort
in'- the ninth. Eagan went to second on
si: "two-base hit and died -there, the next
three men up going out iii turn;-
The Seattles failed- to tally in the first,
but batted out four runs in the second and !
two in the third, which put them in the
lead. . In this inning occurred the only
'sensational feature of the game. "Tacks''
had been sent to first because the pitcher
did not gvt the ball.. over the plate. Clark'
.came .to.. bat and promptly swatted the
bail .over the right field, fence,- .making a
home run and sending "Tacks"- in ahead

sixth and seventh; but they were suffi
cient to win. . â  â

RAIN POSTPONED THE MEET.
San Jose Cycle Races Will Be Held
Next Sunday.
The big bicycle meet that waa to have
been held yesterday at San Jose had to
be postponed until next Sunday owing to
the rain. Although the weather here In
the forenoon was clearing, down there
there were still occasional showers, and
the Garden City Club, which was conduct-
Ing the event, thought it best to await a
more favorable day. Should it rain next
Sunday the meet will go over for another

Joe Sylvester and C. M. ("Bunt") Smith
of the Bay City Wheelmen rode what is
believed to be the first century maue in
California for 1899. They left the club
house on Golden Gate avenue at midnight
on Saturday, and finished in Alameda at
8 o'clock/Pharp on Sunday morning, thus
making* heir net time for the 100 miles
eight hours. They covered the official re
lay course of the Associated Cycling Clubs
arid were checked at various places en
mute, so that the ride and record are au
thentic.
The men had a stiff south -wind to buck
against the first half of their journey to
ward San Jose, but on the return trip on
the Oakland side it was at their backs
and helped them materially on the dreary
grind homeward. Under the conditions
the record made is particularly mer
itorious.
NEITHER HAS AN ADVANTAGE
Fight Between Matthews and Zeigler
Declared a Draw.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.â The Greenwood
Athletic Club of Brooklyn held a boxing
show which began at 3 o'clock this after
noon and the house was uncomfortably
crowded. The star event was a twenty
round bout at catch weights between
Owen Zeigler and Matty Matthews of
this city, both welterweights with good
records. They fought the twenty rounds
hard and Cast, each displaying a great
deal of science and judgment. Neither
let his opponent have tui idle moment,
and before fivo rounds had been gone
through each man's face was well
mark'
For fifteen rounds Matthews had a
slight lead, and although Zeigler did most
of the leading Matthews' counters on tho
wind were effective, Zeigl* r got home
some heavy jolts on the local man's face
and swung both hands to the head. Stop
ping Matthews. Matthews, however, al
ways bad a left uppercut or a swing
ready when ZMgler came within his reach,
and- the latter must have been in grand
shapo to withstand such hard punishment
in the stomach. Toward the close of the
fight Zeigler was the stronger and once.
In the seventeenth round. Matthews
caught him a left hook on the jaw which
forced the Philadelphia^ to his knees.
Zeigler was very strong in the last
round, but Sam Austin, the referee, de
clared the bout a draw. The decision was
a popular one-

Supreme Court Clerk and Attorney
General Now in Harness.
The office of Clerk of the Supreme Court
was turned over yesterday by T. H. Ward
to his successor, G. W. Root, the transfer
taking place at 12 o'clock. Mr. Root's dep
uties have already been mentioned in The
Call. The new Clerk has already found
that the path of the politician is not
strewn with rose?. He- had only six ap
pointments to make, and up to date be
tween 120 and 130 applicants have put in
an appearance for the same. According to
arrangements four places have been filled,
and Mr. Root is puzzling h..- head how ho
can accommodate Vl<) office-seek) re.
Tirey L. Ford, the new Attorney-Gener
al, having taken his oath of office, went to
Sacramento yesterday morning in order
to be present in the Sacramento branch of
the office on the opening of tho legisla
ture. He is expected back on Friday or
Saturday. Mr. Ford will conduct the prin
cipal business of his department upon the
twelfth floor of the Claus Sprockets build
ing, where his private office has been since
the structure was completed. The new
Attorney-General has appointed as his
deputies C. X. Pest, who will attend to
the Sacramento branch; George Sturte
vant of Mendocino County. William Ab
bott and A. A. Moore. George Francis will
act as stenographer and Charles P. Gale
as clerk.
GALLAGHER'S TRAGIC DEATH.
The Police Unable to Find a Witness
to the Murder.
The police have not yet succeeded In
finding an eyewitness to the murder of
"Jim" Gallagher, the ex-prize fighter who
was shot and killed In a saloon at 113
O'Farrell street early Sunday morning.
Mike Flyi.n, who is supposed to have fired
the fatal phot, is still detained at the
City Prison. It is likely that he will be
formally charged with the murder to-day.
Dave Connors, alias Harry Raymond, who
It was said was an" eyewitness to the
shooting, was found yesterday by Detec
tives Cody and Dillon and closely ques
tioned. He admitted he was a frequent
visitor to the saloon where the tragedy
occurred, but denied that he was there
when Gallagher was killed. Dan Sulli
van, the proprietor of the saloon, and
the woman in the case are still being hold
as witnesses.

THE BETTING
SPLASHED IN
Nina Took the First
" Baby Race."
WAS 40 TO 1 IN THE RING
NAPAMAX SCORED IN THE
STAKE EVENT.
A Large Turnout at Oakland Track.
Favorites Buried in Mvd â The
Disgraceful Showing Made
By Mamie G.
Glimmers of welcome sunshine, heavy
showers of rain, a rainbow radiant with
a hundred colors and a great throng of
people ushered in the now year of racing
at Oakland track. The card offered by
tho jockey club over the bay was an es
pecially attractive one In iis original en
tirety, but it was marred by the privi
lege of scratching. The first bunch of
two year old baby racers was to face the
barrier and the Baldwin Hotel handicap
was down for decision; so there is little
wonder that it was worth one's life to
purchase a ferry ticket at the foot of
Market street.
The going was splashy and the way of
the talent was a rough one. Napamax,
a 1 to 2 chance, and Miss Marion, against
which S to 5 was obtainable, were the
winning choices.
The contest for the Baldwin Hotel hand
icap stakes, over one mile, was no rac?Â» at
all. "With nothing to beat, Napamax
went out a 1 to 2 favorite, and actually
rolled in. Hohenzollern, a poor mud run
ner, took the place from Olinthus.
Master Johnny Reiff had the honor of
piloting the first two year old to victory.
He sat astride Nina, a filly by Patriot
from Imp. Remembrance, and at odds of
30 and 40 to 1, got the decision from Tel
low Tail by a short head. The latter,
from the stable of Burns & "Waterhouse,
was the loudest tip of the day, going to
the post an even money favorite.
Tho opening scramble for maiden three
year olds went to the 10 to 1 shot. The
Miller. The outsider, quite extensively
backed, was sent away in front and was
never bothered. M;uster Leo, the favor
ite, secured the placo, half a length be
fore Maud Gnagi.
Nearly all the smart ones, wearing dec
orations on their breasts, backed Free
Lady to win the second number, a six
furlong sprint. The owners of Dunots
and Midlight obligingly scratched, and
then Magrane'.s filly wouldn't do. Away
first after a long, tiresome delay at the
post, that disgusted everybody, she lasted
to the paddock gate and tnen "blew up."
Piggott there got up with the 8 to 1 shot
Highland Ball, and beat Zamar, the fa
vorite, a head. Etta H, severely pun
ished by Turner, and away the best, was
a bang up third.
Barney Schrieber's fast filly. Miss Ma
rion, certainly does like the mud. She
was an 8 to 5 choice over Limewater and
the balance of the company in the seven
furlong run for three year olds, and won

ANOTHER VICTIM OF GAS,
Edward T. Marshall, Second Mate of
the Steamship Scandia, Acci
dentally Asphyxiated.
Edward T. Marshall, second matÂ© ot
the steamer Scandia, was found dead in
bed at 5 o'clock yesterday morning in his
room at 1513 Golden Gate avenue. A part
ly turned gas cock and the fact that the
room was filled with the suffocating vapor
showed the cause of death.
The unfortunate otaÂ» had been in the
best of spirits on the tvening before, and
there is no indication that he committed
suicide. The room was in its usual con
dition, none of the crevices or apertures
having been stopped up. The stop-cock
was lose, and the belief is that Marshall
turned it off in a hurry and turned it
partly on again without knowing it. Ho
was a single man about 30 years old, and
was engaged to be married within a short
time.
Mr. Marshall was at one time mate with
Captain Seaman on the Czarina. Harry
Marshall, captain of the Monarch, is his
brother.

Good Coursing.
RUSTY GOLD WON THE STAKE
HURRICANE A VERY SICK DOG
AT THE FINISH.
Warrior Captured the Sapling Stake

Stake From Black Hawk
After a Struggle.
Yesterday's sport at Ingleside Coursing
Park was first class and well attended,
notwithstanding the inclemency of the
weather. The dogs and hares performed
well.
After the meeting was over a rumor was
circulated that the dog Hurricane, entered
by the P. and E. kennels, had been tam
pered with, and that owing to the stuff
he was forced to drink he "blew up" in
his final course, and was defeated by For
get. There must have been some truth at
tached to the report, as Hurricane grew
deathly sick on the cars returning from
tho park, and it is extremely doubtful if
he will be himself again for some time to
come. It is now in order for the officers
of the park to investigate and disqualify
the man or men who are responsible for
an act that should be punished by fine
and Imprisonment.- Hurricane was cer
tainly "doctored," otherwise Forget, as
the score in a tolerably long course will
attest, beat him pointless.
The result of the final day's meeting of

LIVERPOOL SILVER MEDAL WON
BY E. J. McCUTCHEN.
S. L. Abbott Jr. Took the Gold Medal
and the bpecial Prize for Best
Net Score at Thirty-Six
Holes.
It had been intended to hold yesterday,
beginning- at 10:30 a. m., a nine-holo
scratch game between members of the
Oakland Golf Club, the teams to be
chosen by \V. D. Johnson and P. E.
Bowles from players present at the links
at the time. The prize for the winning
team was to have been a luncheon given
by the losers at 12:30 p. m. Such was
the plan proposed, but the uncertainty of
the weather kept so many players away
from the links that the game was aban
doned. Some few enthusiasts, however,
made a round or two.
At the Presidio the San Francisco Golf
Club had two important competitionsâ for
the Liverpool gold medal and for the
Liverpool silver medal. The gold medal
is contended for annually, and carries

play for one year. The silver medal is
competed for once a month, and is re
tained by the winner until the next
monthly competition. It is at IS holes,
medal play, and each contestant receives
a handicap based upon his recent scores.
The Liverpool gold medal competition at
18 holes, scratch play, began at 10 o'clock
in the morning. Twelve competitors ap
peared, and of those Dr. C. T. Hibbett
and S. L. Abbott Jr. tied with !)â > for the
two rounds. In playing off the tie S. L.

In addition to the prizes already men
tioned a handsome dark oak silver bound
loving cup was offered as a prize for the
best net score at 36 holes, that is, 18 In
the golf medal competition and 18 in the
silver medal contest. This was won by
S. L. Abbott Jr., who made a score of !i9
in the golf medal competition and 97 in
the two rounds for the silver medal, a to
tal of 196 for 36 holes.
The best score made during the day was
S. L. Abbott Jr.'s 44 for nine holes in the
first round of the silver medal competi
tion, which, considering the adverse con
ditions of weather under which it was
made, is a really excellent score. The
next best score was A. B. "Williamson's
47 in the second round of the silver medal
play.
Charged With Insanity.
George F. Bielmeyer, the "mysterious
freak" who was arrested several nights
ago while acting in a suspicious manner
on Valencia street, was formally charged
with insanity last night. He was at once
removed from the City Prison to the in
sane ward of the Receiving Hospital. The
police are convinced that Bielmeyer is
mentally unbalanced.

NORTHER AT SANTA ROSALIA
"WASHED AWAY 300 FEET OF
BREAKWATER.
Fleet of Steamers Overdue From
Northern Ports â Schooner Re
becca Ashore â Danish
Bark Overdue.
The storm broke somewhat yesterday,
and a couple of wind-bound ships got to
sea. The owners of the big four-masted
ship Falls of Clyde were very anxious to
get her away for Honolulu, in order that
she may obtain a Hawaiian registry be
fore the United States laws go into effect,
and had there been any show at all she
â¢would have gone out Sunday. The wind
chopped around to the southwest during
the afternoon, however, and Captain Rock,
Beeing that It would be impossible to get
off shore, decided to remain in port. Yes
terday he would not wait any longer, but
took an extra long tow. in order to get a
good offing. The tug Monarch took the
big ship out over the bar and then for two
hours continued on until the Farallones
were almost reached. Then the Falls of
Clyde was cast off. and Captain Rock
made all pall on his course.
The bark Coloma, for Puget Sound, to
load lumber for China, also made a- start,
but when she got on the- bar Captain
Jensen did not like the looks of things and
put back. When Captain Silovich of the
tug Alert signaled the bark to cast off
the hawser the crew refused to do so, and
the bark was towed back to. the foot of
Powell street, where she anchored. Later
in the day the tug Monarch took the
Coloma in tow and took her well out to
pea. Captain Jensen also wanted to get to
Bea on Sunday, but his bark was in the
stream and he was ashore. It "was blow
ing so hard that none of the boatmen
would take him out. Finally, after four
hours, spent In persuasion, he induced
Tommy Crowley to venture out with him,
and got safely aboard. Yesterday his
contract only called for a tow to the bar,
but had he been left there the southwest
â wind would have driven' him back into
the bay or on Point Bonita.
The heavy norther that did so much
damage on the bay last month extended
as far south as Santa Rosalia. Captain
Yon Helms of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company's Curacao, writing from Guay
mas to the Merchants' Exchange, says
the' storm raged from December 2:'. to 25,
and over 300 feet of the Santa Rosalia
breakwater was carried away. He con
tinues:
On December 25 the Mexican schooner Re
becca, formerly of Han Francisco, while on
her way from Guaymas to Altata, sprang i
a leak and was run ashore, in La Du
pensa Bay, Eepirito Santo Island. Cargo â 
and schooner will probably be- saved and the â 
schooner taken to La I'az for repairs. From j
Friday, December 23, to Sunday, December 25.
Inclusive, the heaviest norther in years blew :
on the Gulf of California. The breakwater at
Santa Rosalia Buffered greatly and about 300
â *, â.Â»,.Â» warned away: The ship Falkland- I
bank broke her winairti -arm - I aim? nÂ»sr Oping t
â¢wrecked, and the ship Star of France lost one
anchor.
The Danish bark Else sailed from Mazat
lan for Guaymas on November 30, and was j
spoken by the Curacao on December 3 twenty
miles off the coast of Lower California. She
has not arrived at Guayrr.as yet, and It is sup
posed that the heavy northerly gales have pre
vented her from making any northing. Though
people here are wondering at her unusual delay !
no uneasiness is felt for her safety.
British ship Falklandbank, Smith master. ;
will finish unloading and ballasting about end i
of month (December) and sail about January 5. L
or as soon as a crew can be had. She is bound
for Victoria, B. C, for orders, and if a full
â  crew cannot be obtained Captain Smith may
call at San Francisco to fill up vacancies. The
Star of France will sail about January 5 for
Honolulu. German ship Maypo, 162 days from
Hamburg arrived at Santa Rosalia on De
cember 2. She will sail for British Columbia
about January 10 to load lumber for Val
paraiso or Callao.
There were a number of steamers over- :
due last nlKlu. The Queen from Putfet
Bound ports was looked for all day. but
did n.>t put in an appearance. The Chil
kat from Eureka was due last Saturday
and there waa a wild rumor around the
front to the effect that she had gon
down with all hand?. No credence was
piv.-n to ili' Btory and the chances arc
that, like ih<> others, she has been de
i by the southeaster. Last Satur
day between T and 8 a. m. the ("hilkat waa
Eighted by the steamer Pomona off Cape
Mendoclno. At that time it was blowing
n living gale. Since then the Pomona
has been Into Eureka, unloaded and load
ed, sailed again :ui'i arrived yesterday,
but did not see the Chllkat again.
The Bonita and Ruth. from Coos Bay.
Noyo from Fort Bragg, Coqullle River
from Tillamook, Samoa from Eureka and
Grace Hollar from Grays Harbor arc all
behind time, but will probably put in an
appearance torday. The collier Mack
inaw from Tacoma was expected last
Saturday, but the chances arc that Bhe
and the Chllkat are both bucking the
southeaster.
There were a couple of changes- on the
quarantine Bteamer Governor Perkins
rday. R. Couzens succeeded J. D.
Bnllivan in the engine-room and J. C.
Johnson took Jack Gately'a place on deck.
BulUvan and Gately have been given jio^l

MONDAY NIGHT
AT THE PLAY
"The Man From Mexico" came back
last night and performed the record
smashing feat of duplicating the success
It had scored In San Francisco a m
ago. There are few farces that we have
sern here in the lafli season, in the last
decade, even, thru could have stood this
t'--i of repetition. The big crowd in the
Columbia last night was not new to Wil
lie Collier and hi* play. The timely nudge
and titter that were passed around in
anticipation of various jokes and situa
tions showed that the audience was fa
miliar with the shew. But knowledge
teemed only to be bliss, and laughter to
the point of tea.rs was the order (J f the
night. â¢ .
Nearly everybody tried last season to
diagnose the comic charms of this farce
and its principal comedian, and finally
threw up the job as silly and lutile. In
the first place, who. In praising the per
formance, is going to tell where the come
dian stops and where the author begins?
to what extent Mr. Dv Souchet is in
debted to the (Trench and to what extern
Willie Collier is indebted to Mr. dv Sou
chet? And. anyway, what's the us- of
trying? Nothing looks so sad and Incom
petent as a would-be scientific explana
tion ot a laugh, fou can dilate on the
pleasures of comedy, spread yourself on
the Incandescent Â»;lit of satire and throw
rich flowers at the drama of manners,
but you can't be important and authori
â¢ over the- irresponsible fun of a
farce Hk- this.
"The Man I'rom Mexico" is howlingly
funny, and in spite of its French extrac
tion it is thoroughly American in Us
mode of fun, sometimes suggestive but
never really risky and always bubbling
with that easy humor of ours which is
above no one and below only the proufl
and stupid. Not to laugh at this per
formance i.s a confession of mental un
health; and not to see it in to miss one
of the important productions of the
century-end, for with all its collo
quialism and unpretentlon "Th* Man
From Mexico" is a wonder hi verbal play
and situation, and Mr. Collier is a farce
actor of unduplicated drollery. Since Nat
Goodwin has gone In for heavier things,

CALIFORNIA'S DAUGHTERS
DEDICATE THEIR CITY HOME
A Cozy Resting Place Turned Over, With Simple Cere
mony, fjy the Establishing Committee to the
Board of Relief.
THE Native Daughters* Home at
925 O'Farrell street is now one of
the institutions of the State, one
that with the energy, heartfelt de
sire to advance the cause of the Na
tive Daughters in this State and the
love of wholesouled women to aid
those who need such, to back it. is
bound to be one of the grandest in
California. Yesterday afternoon the
l>eautiful home of ten rooms, fitted up
with all the comforts of home, was
with simple ceremony turned over by
the committee that prepan 1 it to the
board of relief of the Native Daugh
ti-ri:
Preliminary Â£5 tnr ceremony tnp
home was opened to visitors, who
were shown over the premises in
which everything is asneat as wom
anly Ingenuity and womanly good
taste can make it. The parlors were
decorated with smilax and Christmas
berries ami there was gracefully
draped in the back parlor a large
American flag. There were two rooms
in the house that attracted a yr>;it
deal of attention. One was the rear
room on the upper floor, over the
door of which was a motto in floral
work. "Buena Vista Parlor Hospital
Room." It is the room that has been
fitted up by that parlor as a hospital.
In it there are two white enameled
iron bedsteads with snowy pillows
and covers. The other room was the
large front one. furnished with cher
ry furniture by the chairwoman of the
committee and designated as "The
Mervyn Leake Room." This is also a
most comfortable apartment.
At 3 o'clock Mrs. Julia A. Steinbach,
ncting as mistress of ceremonies,
called on Mrs. W. S., Leake of Califor
nia Parlor of Sacramento, the chair
woman of the committee that estab
lished the home, and that lady in a
short, well delivered address on be
half of the committee turned the home
over to the board of relief. She de
tailed the origin of the idea of the
home and what the Grand Parlor had
done in the matter. She stated that
a hospital where members of the order
could, if sick, find all the aid that they
needed was the basis for the home,
and that the committee also took into
consideration the needs of the local
parlors and decided to add a place
where members of the order could
visit and find a resting place, writing
table and materials and a bookcase,
which it was hoped would soon be
Blled with choice literature. She spoke
of the labors of the committee in the
selection of a suitable place and the
work of securing assistance and the
encouragement it received by dona
tions from Alta, Euena Vista, Minerva
and Oro Fino Parlors of San Kran-
' as our best farce actor, and a brilliant
best he is. His gesticular powers of sug
: gestion, the comic serenity of his voice,
the imperishable air of comic respectabil
â¢ ity that hangs over everything he does
make him one of the most unique flffurcs
in the modern theater. Above all he knows
the value of repression. You never see
: Willie Collier "mug," or even laugh, for
that matter; he knows who should do the
laughing. Another notable actor is Dan
Mason whose Dutchman is really a legiti
mate work of art. Several new faces are

"Standing room only" was the sign at
! the box office at the Grand Opera-house
i both yesterday afternoon and last night.
Every part of the house including the
boxes was packed. The HI Henry Mm
I strels opened a two weeks' engagement
and the reception they were accorded was
exceedingly flattering. There is novelty
even in the jokes, although a few had
been heard before. The stage represented
the deck of the warship Brooklyn and
the minstrels were dressed as tars, with
the exception of J. Albert Gates, the in
terlocutor, who looked like ' Sergeant
Michael Joseph Conboy In uniform.
Among the soloists John H. Davis and
George M. Decker sang with rare feel
f ing and expression and were enthusias
tically applauded. Raymond Teal, Billy
' Clark and Dan Allman. comedians, sang
coon songs and had to repeat them. Hi
Henry's cornet solo, accompanied by his
military band of thirty pieces, was a fea
i ture of the performance, and when he and
four other cornetlsts imitated the Irish

and were recalled four times. The vaude- i

each making donations which wera
most encouraging. -She spoke- of dona
tions of furniture from kind friends,
and said the Indications arc such that
there is every hope that the home
will move the success that its pro
moters hope it will be. Mrs. Leake
then formally passed the keeping of
tli" home to the board of relief.
Past Grand President Carrie R.
Durham, on behalf of the board, ac
cepted the trust and then paid a high
compliment to the committee for its

the board accepted the home it de
sired that the committee should con
tinue the cara of it until the next
meeting of the Grand Parlor. She
then on behalf of the board thanked
Mrs. Leake for having chosen Mrs.
AVilkin for the mother of the Native
Daughters who shall occupy the home.
Past Grand President Mrs. J-. Jl.
Morris, who was the first president of
the board of r.-lief, before it was what
it now is, before it was recognized by
the Grand Parlor, gave a history. of
the boanl ami said that seven yean
ago when s. P. Rugers died he left a
sum of money to be divided between
three charities and through the efforts
of tin- Grand Secretary of the Native
Sons, Henry Lunstedt, the board se
cured (800, sine, which the amount has
been augmented by small annual con
tributions from all the parlors. In
conclusion she i-xpressed the hope that
the home would bind more firmly to
gether the members of the order.
After that followed eloquent ad
dresses by Past Grand Presidents
Miss Marion Bertola, Miss Clara K.
Wlttenmeyer and .Miss Mac B. Wil
kin, whose remarks were well timed
and full of enthusiasm. Miss Witten
meyer on behalf of the committee
presented Mrs. Green and Mrs. stein
bach each a beautiful bunch of red,
white and blue flowers in recognition
of their efforts for the success of the
l)om<\ and at the close of her remarks
asked the audience to sing "Praise
God." Henry I,unstedt was called on
for an address and spoke in words of
commendation of what the radies had
done and when he had finished Mrs.
Steinbach on behalf of the committee
presented Mrs. Leake, the chair
woman, with a gold bangle bracelet,
Baying that the committee could not
allow the occasion to pa.ss without
manifesting in a slight way the great
appreciation it felt for all that she had
done in the work of establishing the
home.
With that the exercises terminated
and there was an adjournment until

Alcazar.
"The Midnight Bell" at the Alcazar
Theater started on its second week last
evening, and proved as much of a draw
ing card as when it first appeared, there
not being a single vacant, seat in the
' house. The piece promises good houses
: during the remainder of the week.
Next Monday evening "The Magistrate"
1 will be produced, with Miss Adelaide

New Comedy.
j The ott brothers opened at the Comedy
Theater last night in "All Aboard,"- a
I furious farce comedy that put the patrons
! of the house in happy holiday humor. The
piece will run all week, giving way Mon
j day to "I'ncle Tom's Cabin."
Orpheum.
Taken act by act, the New Year's bill
1 at the Orpheum seems to excel its Christ

; her multicolored lights may be the attrac
! tion. Anna Teresa Berger is a talented
I cornetlst and has great control over this
! most difficult of musical instruments. The
Deltorelll brothers arc a hit. and, barring
a rather tame opening, have a novelty in
the way of a musical act. The Rappo
sisters have some new character dances
this week, while Riley and Hughes have
i a lot of new jokes that go well.
The Tivoli.
The second week of that attractive holi
day spectacle, "The Yellow Dwarf."
1 opened at the Tivoli last night to an over
flowing audience, which the rain could
I not scare away. Several new and enjoy

these were received with applause and in

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.â The feature oÂ«
to-night's programme at the Indoor
meet of the American Cycle Racing As
sociation in Madison Square Garden
was a fifty-mile paced race between
Harry Elko.s of Glen Falls, N. V., and
Frank Waller, the "Flying Dutchman,"
of San Francisco, who now claims Bos
ton as his home. Waller received a
concession of a start of two minutes.
The prize was a purse of $1000; $GOO to
the winner and $400 for the loser. Elkes
won easily. Waller rode a chainless
machine.
The "Flying Dutchman" made eight
quarter laps in the two minutes con
ceded him, and then Elkes started out
in pursuit. Elkes covered the first mile
in 1 4-5 seconds faster time than Waller
aml his time for the five miles was
10:26 3-5, while Waller's time Tor the
same distance was 11:14 2-5. The time
for ten miles was: Elkes, 20:59 2-5;
Waller, 22:15 2-5.
At fifteen miles Elkes had gained
back one minute and forty-five seconds
of his allowance and was riding beau
tifully. Whenever the Butler brothers
got in front of Waller the Dutchman
gained a little on his opponent, but
whenever they dronned out Waller's
other pacers were unequal to the occa
sion and Elkes rapidly gained ground.
W r hen each had ridden twenty miles
Elkes was only three-fifths of a second
behind in actual time.
At twenty-ono miles and three laps
Klk.'s overtook Waller and shot ahead
of him. At twenty-five miles Elkes was
one lap ahead and stii going nicely.
At the end of an hour Elkes had cov
ered twenty-seven miles seven laps.
Elkes' time for thirty miles was sixty
flve minutes. Waller's time was 67:46 4-5
and Elkes was three laps ahead. At
forty miles Elkes was fivp laps In front.
and he rode his forty-third mile in
1:59 4-5.
From tliis point to the end of the race
Elkes continued to gain, and at the fin
ish he was nine laps and ten yards to
the good, and Waller did rmt ride out
the distance. His time for forty-nine
miles was 1 : T.2 : 3 5. and Elkes' time for
the fifty miles was 1:50:46 2-5. Sum

KINDERGARTENS WILL
NOT BE REOPENED
Cnairman Wemple of San Jose Board
of Education Remains
Firm.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 2.-The City Board of
Education to-night, in executive session
lasting four hours, tried In vain to get
Chairman Wemple to agree to the open
ing of the kindergartens to-morrow. They
were unsuccessful and the public schools
will open without the kindergartens.
About a month ago the board adopted
a resolution closing the kindergartens
owing to a shortage of funds. Their cost
was over SlLliO per month and In the re
maining live months of the year would
have caused a deficiency of $6000. For the
past week Trustees Kenyon, Graham
O'Neill and Langford have been working
to reopen the schools and trying to get
"VVemple to join them and make the ac
tion unanimous. To-night they proposed
to open four of the kindergartens in
buildings owned by the city, employing
eight teachers and four janitors. Sala
ries were to be cut from $7"> to $70 for
principal and $50 for assistant. This
would cost about $600 a month and plunge
the department in debt. There were for
merly seven kindergartens and seven
teen teachers.
This great desire of the Trustees to start
the kindergartens is due to the fact that
several of the Trustees have relatives in
the kindergarten department for whom
they wish to provide jobs. After tiring
of the session Wemple drew the law on
the others and showed that the meeting

vada town. But her heart remained whole until she met George F. Kinney, a #
clerk in the office of the Nevada, California and Oregon Railway at' Reno, sev-
eral months ago. Kinne^- was 26 and a manly sort of a fellow and at once suc-
cumbed to the charms of the Southern Pacific agent's daughter. He pressed his
suit with ardor and he was not long in learning that his love was returned. The
young couple became engaged, but when the. father of the girl was approached
on the subject he waxed wroth and refused to even consider the marriage of
his daughter to the clerk.
Finally they decided to ignore him altogether in the matter. Last Saturday
night Mr. Kinney and Miss Phillips met at the Methodist parsonage at Reno and
were quietly married. They 'took the next train for San Francisco, arriving here
Sunday morning. As their departure had been arranged with every precaution
of secrecy they brought little in the way of baggage, but they are not worrying
on that account.. A dozen Saratoga trunks filled with the latest Parisian crea-
tions would not have increased the happiness of the bride. The news of the
marriage followed the publication of the marriage license in Reno yesterday.
Mr. and Mrs. Kinney are registered at the Grand Hotel, where they will prob-*
ably remain until the expected forgiveness arrives.

HARRISBURG. Pa., Jan. 2.â The
fight for the next United States Senator

on the time of holdi the joint Repub
lican caucus. Senator Quay's friends;
have fixed the meeting for to-morrow
evening, and if majority oÂ£ the Re
publican legislators attend, his nomi
nation is assured. Ills managers pre
dict to-ni( that the caucus will be
held at the appointed time and that
th( is no question of his success. The
opposition are just as confident that
there will be li postponement until
after the Supreme Court disposes of the
criminal charges against Quay, grow
ing out of the failure of the People's
Hank of. Philadelphia. if they can
bring about a postponement; they be
lieve Quay cannot be re-elected. They
have been working all day to persuade
enough publican Senators and mem
bers to stay away from the meeting to
prevent a majority. One Senator and
three members from Delaware County
agreed to-night to stay away from the
gathering. This action was taken by
one of their number, Ward K. Bliss,
who was defeated for Speaker of the
House of Representatives. Several
other Senators and members will not go
Into the caucus, but neither side can

MERCIER'S PECULIAR
METHOD OF DEDUCTION
IN THE DREYFUS CASE
v LONDON, Jan. 2.â A dispatch from Paris to the St. James Gazette 0
0 fays that the gist of the testimony given before the Court of Cassa- 0
O lion by General Mercler. who was Minister of War at the time of the 0
O condemnation of Dreyfus, has become public. The former War Minis- 0
0 tor's testimony, the dispatch says, amounts to a declaration that he 0
O arrived at the conviction of Dreyfus' guilt by a process of elimination, 0
0 He first took the named of all of the officers who would i> a likely to 0
0 be in possession of exclusive opportunities to perpetrate acts of trea- 0
0 son by the disclosure of secret information, hair of which he Imme- &
O. dlately discarded. Of those .remaining he eliminated more until there 0
0 were only three names left. Two of these were thrown out, leaving 0
0 but one name, which was that of Dreyfus. It is stated that this testi- 0
0 niony, calmly given by General Merrier, threw the Judges into a state 0
0 of consternation. It is reported that General Mercier is about to crave 0
O British hospitality. $
Â£âº PARIS, Jan. The Intransiceant, edited by Henri Rochefort. a 0
0 violent opponent of Dreyfus revision, is responsible for the statement 0
0 that thÂ« Court of Cassation has waived its intention to bring Dreyfus 0
0 back, because of the Government's representations of the danger of 0
0 lynching and riots, and of the necessity for a large military force to 0
0 protect him. The recently formed league, known as La Patrie Fran- 0
0 '.;..â  . headed by MM. Ferdinand Brunetiere-Coppeet and Maurice Bar- 0
0 riss, with a large following of authors, professors and scientists, whose 0
0 avowed object is to knit intellectual France into a union for counter- 0
0 acting the Dreyfus agitation, has raised a fierce press controversy. 0
0 which threatens an agitation worse than that which La Patrle la 0
0 FrancaiÃe was intended to counteract. 0
0 LONDON Jan. 2.â The Paris correspondent of the Daily Chron- 0
0 ide Bays that hi' Yarns' that Dreyfus actually started for France. 0

j ered with red bunting and flowers and
| green added to its attractiveness. The
enterprise <Â»f the citizens of San Pedro
i In Bending up the turnout was the sub
ject of much favorable comment. An
other striking feature of the float sec
tion was from the Academy of the Holy
Name of this city. It was a patriotic
design, the red body of the float being
: surmounted by a double arch, decorated
with palms and smllax, geraniums and
carnations. American flags flew from
the corners of the vehicle and its rear
was similarly adorned. Under arches

}&', utter criticizing Oak.and'a schools. <Â§> â 
; .':y" : Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
â¢,?.*; " 908 Broadway, Jan. -â¢ â 
..â¢r .The manner in which the public schools
: ; : Bhall be conducted la evidently to be a I
'..factor In the city campaign. The red
â hoi letter of Councilman Cuvellier, Issued
ft couple of months ago, and the recent re
port of the Superintendent of Schools
have been criticized by T. J. Van Dyke
and a comparison shows that there [a an
issue 10 i'< met by the Board of School
Directors to be elected next March.
Jn his letter Mr. Van Dyke says:
The city Superintendent of Education vir
tually admits that there does feem to be some
:" thing wrong with the methods of â¢ Instruction
â  in our schools when he tells us that lllteen j
â  per cent of the pupils have failed or promo- !
tion.
. This failure he attributes to various causes. j
â¢â¢ â Of the 1.. per cent of failures nve per cent .
were because of lack of Interest in tlit-ir studies
â¢â¢'*>n the part of the pupils.
.â ' Perhaps no real effort was made to arouse
â¢..the interest of these live per cent In their
â work. Possibly the teachers had too many
â¢'â¢.pupils In their respective classes, and they â 
-'.could not give to these children a sufficient â 
;' amount of Individual attention.
Adding up all these different per cents, we j
find that rrono a variety of causes fifteen
oat of every one hundred children attend- ,
ing our Oakland public schools have failed of
promotion, or, in whole numbers and leaving
out fractions, nearly one child out of every
" Bix. This proportion seems too large, It is too
large.
What is the remedy.
' 1 answer: More thorough preparation in the
lower eradeÂ«. t
â¢ How is this to be secured?
â¢ â  By smaller classes and more teachers.
Where is the money coming from?
There will tie money enough it the usual ap
. portionment of funds is only judiciously ex- >
. pended.
'!â¢ What our Oakland schools need aie more â .
.'. teachers and smaller classes in the lower
â¢ grades, so that the younger children may re- ,
.â¢celve that Individual attention which. is best
calculated to awaken their ambition and hold j
. their interest in their studies.
â¢. Hut the tax-paying pubtic will not tolerate |
.. high-priced teachers and small classes in these j
lower grades, because the high-priced teachers ;
ar- not necessary for this work, and it would i
he simply a waste of public funds to employ
â¢ them, whereas the small classes are necessary
fur the welfare and the best interests of the
: younger children attending our public schools,
so that they may have more "individual at- ;
tention" than they now receive.
It must sis. i bo said out of justice to our
own public schools that the same defects which '
exist here are also lund in the public schools
' nf many large [ties in the United States. Hut
that is no reason why Oakland should not take i
the lead in the matter of reforming thÂ»se d"
fects. On the contrary it would be to her
credit to do so.

A MORGUE TOO MUCH.
Stores Leased for Four Years Now a
White Elephant.
OAKLAND, Jam. 2.â The bitterness of
i the struggle to supply the morgue for
Coroner Mehrmann has Just become pub
i lie. and there Is likely to be a lawsuit
arising from it. James McCarthy had
Iso much confidence that the morgue
would be taken from Albert Brown and
1 placed with him that he leased two stores
for four years from the Countess de
Bezon Lacouzlere of AlamÂ»*da. These
stores were located on San Pablo avenue,
and adjoin McCarthy's place of business.
The tenants were even Riven bonuses t<Â»
vacate, and the word whs given out that
McCarthy was to .^et the plum.
Or. Mehrmann decided to make no
change, and now the lease has been
turned back to Attorney McGee, who rep
. resents the Countess.

SPOILED HIS
CLOTHES BUT
SHED A LIFE
Acid Poured on a
Rescuer.
FRANK HITCHCOCK'S STORY
STRUGGLED WITH A WOULD
BE SUICIDE.
The Hospital Steward Develops a
Lack of Memory That May
Yet Prove to Bo
Serious.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
POB Broadway, Jan. 2.
Before the new year was an hour old
Frank Hitchcock saved a would-be sui
cide's life, but was severely burned about
the face in the attempt. His story, as
told at the Receiving Hospital, is one
of a severe struggle on Broadway in the
early morning.
Hitchcock was suffering from some
severe burns on. the face and hands when
he appeared at the hospital, but his in
juries were not serious, and after being
treated he was able to go to his home on
Gilbert street.
"I was going home," said Hitchcock,
"when I met a man whom 1 did not know,
but who spoke to me. 1 saw him take
a bottle from his pocket, and as he held
it tip he said: 'Well, here goes.' and
made a movement to put the bottle to his
lips. 1 did not know what was in the
bottle, but Buspected poison. I tried to
take it from him and he resisted. We
struggled for several minutes and ] could
tell by the smell that the bottle contained
carbolic acid.
"When he saw that I was determined
he tried to throw the acid over me, and
some of it was spattered over my face
and hands. As soon as the bottle had
been emptied over me or on the ground
I quit and the fool ran off. However,
that bottle of carbolic acid did me more
harm than It did to him. The next crazy
fellow 1 meet who attempts to end his
life with acid will be permitted to do so
without restraint. 1 got the worst of the
incident."
Hitchcock has no idea as to who the
man was who was anxious to be Coroner
Mehrmann's first case.
During the past week Stuart Borchert,
a new steward, has been "breaking in"
at the Receiving Hospital, and lie does
not appear to have the power of memory
necessary to carry out his duties A
week ago William Keating:, who has
charge of the county's insane, went off
for a day ami left a very violent lunatic
without guard. While he was away the
matron. Miss McDonald, was nearly
murdered by the lunatic. This occurred
at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, and al
though the representatives of several
newspapers asked for the record of the
hospital the steward forgot all about the
serious affair until the next afternoon
The attempted suicide that Hitchcock
prevented occurred very early yesterday
morning, but although Korchert was
asked for the hospital records of vester
?^y his naemory failed to recall anything
mat nan transpired until noon to-day It
is feared that if the new steward's mem
ory does not improve after New Year the
consequences may be serious.
VAST DEPOSITS
OF PLATINUM
Discovery in the Granite
Creek District.
Special Dlsnatrh to The Call.
VANCOUVER, Jan. 2.â Vast deposits
of platinum have been discovered in the
Granite Creek mining district near
Smilikameen River, this province, and
have attracted the attention of West
era capitalists. Thomas H. Murphy. '
one of the largest mine owners of this
place, is at present in this city and is
authority for a statement made by Col
onel Barrows, president of the Wels
bach Light Company, who made per
sonal examination of the new fields.
that they are the lcrgest and richest
ever known, mountain deposits ex
cepted.
The discovery was made thirty miles
from Granite Creek. For years minors
working in the placers there have been
throwing away gravel containing- won
derful deposits of platinum, not know
ing its worth. Colonel Harrows, with
Mr. Day. head of the Geological De
partment at Washington. Investigated
the find thoroughly, and was so firmly
convinced that it is very rich that the
former, in tho interest of his company.
will commence operations on a large
scale to mine the black sund for miles
along the bed of Cham-ion Creek. Mr.
Murphy to-day received a letter from
Colonel Barrows conveying this news.
In view of the fact that the platinum
deposits in the I'ral Mountains are
nearly exhausted, according to Dr. Day.
and no other fields of importance are
known in the world, the Granite Creek
find will p/ove one of great importance
to this nrovince.
Several miners, realizing at last the
value of the platinum, have been min
ing it in a crude way recently, and at
56 an ounce have made as high as $25
a day.
Phleger's Slayer Paroled.
WOODLAND. Jan. 2.â 11. J. Palmer,
who was for a long time the Yolo County
manager of the Fair property, and who
killed Charles Phlegor and was sentenced
to serve seven years In States prison, was
released from San yuentin on Sunday on
parole granted him by the Board of Pris
on Directors at its last meeting. He has
served about four years of his sentence,
but with credits for good behavior his
term will expire shortly. Palmer came up
on Sunday evening's train and went to
Knight's Landing, where he will remain
for the present.
Found Dead in a Barn.
WOODLAND, Jan. 2.â The body of an
unknown man was found in a barn on
John Dinsoale's place, three miles east of
this city, last evening. The discovery was
made by Mr. Dinsdale. The man had been
dead for several days. Nothing was
found on the body to disclose the Identity
of the dead man. He was of large build
and rough features, and had a full growth
of whiskers.

LIMA, Peru. Jan. 2.â The president of

favorably received.
RAIN AND
SNOW FALL
STEADILY
Lowlands Still Drenched
and tl}e White Garb of
the Hills Deepens.
Heavy Precipitation tfye Salvation
of tf)e Drought-Stricken Por
tion of Monterey County.
Rain which began falling in San
Francisco and throughout the the cen
tral part of the State with the dawn
of the new year continues, and indi
cations are that it will fall for the rest
of the week. The entire State is receiv
ing a drenching such as has been ar
dently prayed for by the farmers,
miners, orchardists and merchants for
weeks past and the feeling of alarm
and apprehension of a devastating
drought has given place to general joy.
In this city the rain has fallen inter
mittently since 2 o'clock Sunday morn
ing. It let up for a brief period on Sun
day night, only to come down again in
sheets early yesterday morning. Dur
ing the forenoon the sky again cleared
and the sun came out bright and warm,
but the old Jupiter Pluvius was not
through with his job by any means and
before 3 p. m. the sun had again re
tired behind the weeping clouds.
The storm has gradually spread all
over the State. In the north it has
taken the form of snow and the fall of
Hakes in that section h:is 1 n greater
than at any time since the early seven
ties. It has now reached clear to the
Mexican lines on the s<-uth. and the
parched hills and valleys in Southern
Monterey and Northern San Luis
Obispo counties, where the lark of,
moisture has caused great Buffering to
stock, have been soaked through and
thr.-ugh. The value of this opportune
rain to the whole State of California
cannot be overestimated, it will en
rich farmers and orchardists and give
an impetus to all lines of business as
nothing else could.
The local Weather Bureau Issued no
bulletin yesterday, it being a holiday,
but Professor Hammon says the st<-rm
has hardly reached its height and that
there is nothing to cause any fear of a
let-up for several days at least.
REDDING, Jan. 2.â At C o'clock on
the morning of the new year eighteen
inches of snow on the level was meas
ured in this city, and it was still snow
ing heavily. Between midnight and
break of day the electric lights went
out. the wires being down in many
places or crossed by the broken lines
of the Sunset Telephone Company. A
number of barns and sheds throughout
the town were crushed in by the weight
of snow, but the damage is inconsider
able. Front yards and flower gardens
Buffered most from the phenomenal
snowfall. The north bound Oregon ex
press was held here until the tracks
north to Dunsmuir could be cleared by
snowplows working this way. The
south bound Sacramento local, due to
leave at a few minutes past 8 a. m..
was unable to get away until late in
the day. The local coaches stand on a
siding a quarter of a mile below the
station, while the locomotive is housed
in the roundhouse above the depot. It
required three hours' bucking and
snorting and shoveling for the engine
to couple on to the coaches. During the
forenoon the snow settled almost as fast
as it fell, so that the depth did not quite
reach two feet. It is estimated that
fully thirty inches fell. An extraordi
nary depth fell in the mountains. When
the storm broke in liedding shortly
after noon the nearby mountains were
still enveloped in a furious snowstorm.
The roads are blocked and teaming and
staging will be tied up for several days.
Should a warm rain follow, the Sacra
mento River will be booming at high
water mark. Laf orers reaped a harvest
shoveling snow from roofs. They got
their own prices. Fifty cents an hour
was no inducement. People became
afraid their houses would fall in and
kill them and the roofs of all the other
buildings were cleared of the snow.
Such a storm is almost as much a phe
nomenon hen- as it is in San Franeisoo.
as many winters pass without a Hake
of snow. Only once in the history of
the town was the present snowfall ex
ceeded and that irly i . the seventies.
The storm is worth thousands of dollars
to Shasta, and everybody is accordingly
Jubilant.
CAYI'COS, Jan. 2.â This vicinity re
ceived a rich New Year biessine last
night and to-day in a copious downpour
of rain, amounting to 1.30 inches. Cavu-
COS had suffered immeasurably from
the long-continued drought, but this
rain is sufficient to star', '.he grass and
grain. In the past twenty-one months
only nine inches of rain had fallen and
last season no crops were raised. This
is a dairy region and cattle suffered
greatly. Many thousands of head have
been shipped out, and the industry is
much crippled. Fearing another dry
season less than the average acreaee
of seeding has been done, but the
ranchers will now make up for lost
time.
DUNSMTIR, Jan. 2.â Yesterday at
noon a snowstorm with a strone: south
wind began to cover the ground rapidly
and to-niÃht there are three feet of
snow, with indications that there will
b<- twice that by morning. This is the
deepest snow since the winter of |sM.
and bids fair to equal or surpass that
of the winter of 1890-91. The Oreeon
express that left San Francisco yester
day evening was delayed in the' 1 ted
ding yard until the snowplow from
Dunsmuir arrived to clear the yard at
that point, allowing the express train
to move, it arriving at Dunsmuir at 6:30
p. m. Here it met the south bound ex
press. The road is open, but the storm
Increases to a gale at times and makes
it difficult for the plows to keep the
track clear. The rotary did excellent
work in clearing thÂ» Dunsmuir van! to
day and is ready for any emergency
that may come up. The south bound
express left Dunsmuir at S p. m.
FRESNO. Jan. 2.â Rain be-an to fall
last night at 9:30 o'clock and continued
until after 5 o'clock this niornintr. I'd
to !> o'clock .r>S of an inch had fallen,
making a total of 2.52. which at this
time is fully one-half tne total rainfall
for last â  ";ir's winter season. The in
dications are for more rain. The sun
was out to-day bright and warm. For
more than one week the skies have been
dark and there has been an arctic cold
spell. Advices from Pine Ridge, in the
mountains are that 18 Inches of snow
fell during the night and that it is still
snowing.
SALINAS, Jan. 2.â The most benefi
cial rain that has fallen here for many
months ushered In 1899 in pleasing style
and up to 6 o'clock this evening over
two inches had fallen. It is still rain
ing heavily. To the depressed farmers
In the southern part of Monterey Coun
ty this rain is a blessing. The least
precipitation in any portion of the
county was one inch and in some places
three inches fell. The storm has not
ended and everybody is confident that
enough rain will fall to insure good
crops and plenty of feed.
WATSON VI LLH. Jan. 2.â lt com
menced raining here at 10 p. m. and
continued steadily until S o'clock this
morning. The rainfall for the twenty
four hours ending at 7 a. m., according
to M. Valentine's gauge, was 2.23
inches.
SAN LT'IS OBISPO Jan. 2.â Rain be
gan here early last evening and con
tinued nearly all night, with showers
to-day. The total for tht storm was 2.36
inches. The rain was very timely and
relieves the anxiety of agriculturists
and business men. It was general, both
north and south of this place.
SAN JOS I-:. Jan. 2.â To-day .22 of an
inch of rain fell and the drops are still
falling.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2.â A drizzling
rain began falling at an early hour this
morning and continued throughout the
day. The precipitation is light, but con
tinuous, and the indications are for a
generous downpour.
CHINO, Jan. 2. â Rain commenced
falling here this morning and continued
nearly all day. Up to 5:30 the precipi
tation amounted to .71 Of an inch, with
prosnects for more to-night.
SAN DIEGO. Jan. 2.â lt began rain
ing here soon after 3 o'clock this after
noon and there was a steady downpour
for three or four hours, nearly a half
inch falling. The weather is cloudy to
night. Reports from the country indi
cate that the storm was much heavier
there than in the city. La Mesa. Des
canso and Campo report sixty hun
dredths at C o'clock and still rammer.
KESWICK, Jan. 2. â Shasta County
has never had as heavy a fall of snow
as came Sunday night and yesterday.
It is three feet on a level. Ordinarily
there is barely enough here in winter
for schoolboys to make snowballs. The
furnaces of the Mountain Topper Com
pany were all drawn this morning, and
500 men were laid off. Work cannot
be resumed until the snow blockade is
removed; which will be only a day or
s< i.
FTLLERTON, Jan. 2.â The rainfall
to-day was .46 of an inch. Prospects
are good for a continuation.
VENTURA, Jan. 2.â The protracted
drought was broken to-day. The rain
fall in the various parts of the coun
ty was from one to one and a quarter
inches. Considerable snow fell in the
mountains. The frost conditions cause
some apprehension as to the safety of
citrus fruits.
MADERA, Jan. 2.â Madera County
was treated to a general rain last night,
which fell slowly and without any wind
whatever, every drop of it being drunk
in by the thirsty earth. The stock in
places was almost on th" verge of suf
fering and the farmers had come to a
halt with their seeding because of the
unfavorable condition of the ground.
Quite a heavy hail and sleet storm oc
curred at noon to-day, which ended In
a fine shower, bringing the entire
amount of precipitation for the pres
ent storm up to one inch. While this
is rot enough to thorousrhlv soak th~
dry ground, it will enable the farmers
to continue their seediner. which many
of them had to discontinue on account
of lack of rain. It will also start the
feed growing at once. The acreage
sown to wheat and barley is lnrger
than usual nn'l with reasonable show
ers during the late winter and early
spring. Madera County will harvest the
largest grain crop ever known in this
section.
FRESNO. Jan. 2.â The downpour
whnh ceased here early this morning
was resumed again to-night Rain be
pan to fall .-.bout ft o'r-look. The rain
fall -vithin the past forty-eight hours
is about .62 of an inch. The indications
are thnt a heavy downpour will occur
to-morrow.
WOODLAND. Jan. 2.-Thf> rainfall
for th<} storm amounted to 1.65 inches
at S o'clock this morning, making a to
tal of OS inches for the season The
farmers and fruit growers feel much
encouraged over the outlook, but more
than the normal amount of rain must
fall during January and February to
insure good crops.
RAIN FOLLOWS TEMBLOR.
GUERXEVILLE. Jan. 2,-At 5 o'clock
this mornina: this section was shaken by
an earthquake, which was followed by a
tremendous downpour of rain, lasting
about an hour. The shocks were from
north to south, with the usual swavln"
motion, lasting about twenty seconds No
damage was done.
WASHINGTON'S SNOWSTORM.
SPOKANE. Jan. 2.â During the last
two days Spokane experienced the
heaviest snowstorm in its history. Rin<-p
yesterday morning 15 inches have
fallen, making 26 inches on the ground.

culty in keeping their lines open. In
places the snow has drifted to a depth
of five feet. All railroad lines running
through tho city have run approxi
mately on time by the aid <-f many
snowplows. The snow in Eastern
"Washington is heaviest within a radius
of two miles of Spokane.

GUNST SEEKS
TO BRIBE AN
ASSEMBLYMAN
Promises Alden Anderson a Place on
the Police Force for a Vote
for Burns.
The Corruptionists, Fearful of Public Scandal and
Indignation, Modify Their
Original Plans.
Mose Gunst and Chief of Police I^ees
refuse to be frightened away from their
helpless prey in the Police Department.
The plot, which waÂ« hatched months ago,
to i;se the department and sacrifice its
interests and some of its best men to the
Senatorial ambition of Dan Burns, is to
be carried to completion, although on
lines slightly different from those first
made. As was to be expected, the ex
pose of The Call created consternation in
police and political circles. Most of the
men that had been selected for the sacri
fice learned for the first time, through the
columns of The Call, that they had been
chosen for dismissal.
During the day every Influence was
brought to bear by the endangered men
i i save themselves from decapitation.
Friends of the scheming Commissioners
and the Chief of Police were lmportune<
to use their good offices to prevent th.
outrageous action proposed by the i'< n
Bion Commissioners. The pressure wa:
great enough to change the method oor: r
the proposed outrage, but it was not
powerful enough to modify th.' cruel plai
of Dan Burns. His victims must fall be
neath the official ax. but in order to
avoid, if possible, a public outcry, the
executions will be gradual instead of a
general sweep.
The gambling Commissioner and the
Chief of Police have gone too far in their
unscrupulous alliance with Burns to re
tire. The hide-bound Senatorial aspira:<t
is proof against the lash of public
lon and his confreres must obey- him.
They will do so more adroitly, hoy
than they lirst schemed. Possibly not
more than a third of the vacancies in the
Police Department demanded by Burns
will be created at the session of the Po
lice Pension Commissioners at its me< t
iiig this morning. Before the State. Leg
islature has adjourned, however, the other
vacancies will be made and if poss
twenty-five new places will be created m
the department.
This audacious scheme will give Burns,
therefore, titty positions to be used as
bribes at Sacramento. There will
double advantage in creating vacancies
gradually instead of by wholesale, .
tingle stroke of the pen. Burns X
from his experience as a lobbyist at the
Slate capita! that it is not always wis
dom to pay before the â â goods" are
livered. He will keep his chattels in line,
therefore, until the votes are counted.
That this is ibe policy determined upon
by Burns and accepted By his satellite.
Gunst. is proved absolutely by a r<
experience <>i Assemblyman Alden Ander
son of Solano. Joseph Circle, a mer
chant of Suisun. sought to obtain from
Gunst a place on the police force for a
man named Fitzpatrick. The wily Com
missioner declared that he would make
Fitzpatrick a patrolman if Assemblyman
Anderson would agree to vote for Dan
Burns for I'nited States Senator. No
other concession was demanded. In order
mat the coveted position might be ob
tained Andersuii must accept it as a
bribe to vote lor the knavish aspirant for
national honor. He indignantly refused.
This transaction indicates dearly that
Dan Burns has not yet abandoned the
practice that brought him thrice behinc
Che doors of a prison. As a betrayer oi
nubile and private trust he has raised
himself t" a point where as briber anc
qorruptionist he may enter the national
capitni. There is no precedent in this
State for such a shamelessly notorious
barter and sale of the honor of public
men. Tli. re have been former aspirants
for Senatorial hbners : tbat were suspected
of having used bribery with which
to win their dignity. Dan Burns is the
nrst to bear openly the scar of guilt. The
bait offered by other men was money.
That of Dan Burns is the livelihood of
men who must submit their very exist
ence to a brace of gamblers.
Chief of Police Lees stormed yesterday
as usual. He admitted, however, that the
list of police officers as published in The
Call was correct and had been in his pus
srssi..n for several days. The <'hlef was
!i"T so frank in an explanation of his
recent relations with Commissioner -Mose
Gunst. Two months ago (Jurist and Lees'
were at each other's throat. Each was
blackguarding the other in up-to-date
profanity. Lees was loud in his insist
ent assertion that GUnst sought to throw
the town wide (.pen to gamblers, thieves
blacklegs and criminal*. Gunst replied
that the old man was dreaming in the
fantasies of old age and should be retired
before he did damage to himself or others
Now Lees and Gunst are chums. They
swap lies, exchange treats and piot the
sacrifice of men who have no friends
The change came a little less than two
months ago when Dan Hums determined
that he should be I'nited States Senator
Burns was the peacemaker and when he
makes peace some .me else must suffer
He induced I.ees and Gunst to srttlo their
differences and in harmony betray tlu Po
llie Department to him." Thatis why
Gainst and I.ecs have been friends, for
nearly two months.
While 1-ees would not discuss yesterday
his relation* with Gunst he did reveal the
rntlre policy of Dan Burns in manipulat
ing the Police Department to his political
advantage. The venerable Chief de
clared with much solemnity that
Be will insist this morning, at the
meeting of the Police Pension Commis
sioners, upon the adoption of a most
Important resolution. This is nothing
more than that the Pension Commis
sioners snail not arbitrarily retire officers
when they reach the age limit unless
such officers are physically or mentally
incapable <.f performing their duties
( hlef of Police I.ees declares that this
resolution will be adopted by the Pension
Commission and Its adoption - will show
the commission serves no private interest
or corrupt one as in the ( . aK e of Dan
Burns. As a matter of fact, the resolu
te:, will suow nothing of the sort The
discretlonarj power of dismissal and of
retirement will still remain with the Pen
sion Commissioners. It is they who de
termine the mental or physical capacity
of the men to be decapitated. Unpro
tected officers, without influence will still
remain the victims of those in power
The suggestion of the resolution how
ever, has a deep significance in another
direction. It mmnF that Dan Burns and
his sycophantic t0,, 15, Gunst and T,ees
have decided not to bravr the outcry of
public Indignation that would follow the
retirement of twenty-five men. most of
â whom are fully able to perform their
duties. The precious triumvirate of
schemers h.'is decided to work more in
sidiously and to attack lirst the men who
have met misfortune and are overcome by
Illness. That this illness is the result of
public service is no concern of Dan Burns
or ills lieutenants.
it is the sick men of the department
who will be dismissed therefore to-day
The meeting of th<> Pension Commission
ers will begin at 11 o'clock this morning
unless the condition of Commissioner To
bin is worse than it was yesterday. The
men sin ted for dismissal are the follow
ing: William McCottren. Charles Hen
nessey, Maurice Lrnane, Harrison Moran
Frank W. Riloy. W. n. Bcott and R. j.'
McCmyaii. Three others. -Patrolmen
ftforehouse. Fred Smith and Charles
O'Malley. have already sent" ln their resig
nations and will bo retired. One or two
others who resisted vigorously the plot
to retire them may suffer the vengeanerj
6f th'" commission for their audacity.
Among them Corporal Heaney and Se'r
?;eant Brown have very good reasons to
eel uneasy.
This tribute of official heads wi'.l prob
ably conclude the first gift of the Police
Commissioners to Dan Burns. The rest
will follow before the State Legislature
hits adjourned. The appointment of twen
ty-five additional officers will be consid
ered by the Commission at the proper
time. Dan Burns, as far as the corrup
tion of the local Police Departnrent is con
cerned, is absolute master of the situ
ation.
MASKED ROBBER HOLDS
UP A SCHOOL TEACHER
Mrs. Pucker Assailed by a Highway
man in the Heart of the
Town.
OAKLAND. Jan. 2.â Mrs. Tucker, a
teacher in the Franklin School, and well-
known throughout the city, was held up
this evening by a masked robber in a
populous part of the city.
The lady was returning home about 10
i O'clock along Webster street, when, about
a block from the narrow-gauge depot,
she was confronted by a man whose fea
tures were concealed by a dark mask.
He roughly demanded money, and when
; Mrs, Pucker screamed in terror, repeated
; his demand with violent threats. The
lady, however, continued to call for help
and the cowardly ruffian becoming fright
â  :;â¢ d, took to his heels.
The police were immediately notified,
but up to a latÂ«- hour had secured no
clew to the miscreant.

Michael W. Schumacher and His

Poison, in what form is a matter of con

TRAGEDY AVERTED BY
FATE'S INTERVENTION
THAT which may justly be termed
the criminal negligence of Albert
Lawson, Southern Pacific signal
and gate man at the Howard-street
cross-ing between Twenty-third and
Twenty-fourth streets, and the de
plorable lack of system on the part of
the Market-strcot Railroad Company, or
the criminal disregard of its employes,
nearly resulted in a ghastly tragedy yes
terday shortly after 1 o'clock. The dingy
dog park special, composed of a half
score of third class tourist and immi
grant cars, jammed with sporting men,
crashed into the forward end of car G7B
of the Howard-street lino at the cross
ing mentioned, and that the lives of sev
eral women and two young men were not
ground out beneath the wheels of the
special or crushed nut in the torn and
twisted street car is due solely to the
kindly intervention of fate, not to the
courage, the judgment or the intelligence
of all or any railway official.
The story of the accident is best told in
the words of Charles Hawes, grlpman of
car GTS of the Howard line. U&wes was
the omy one injured in the accident; that
lie was not killed is a miracle. Lying on
a l>ed of pain in his home, 1019% Natoma
street, before the arrival of Dr. Coffey,
who examined Ins hints, lie said that
he left the end of the line shortly after 1
o'clock. Reaching the turn at Howard
and Twenty - fourth streets he went
around and stopped as is the custom of
the road. "I glanced up Twenty-fourth
street toward Capp," he Bald, "and see
ing that the gates were down at the
crossing I concluded that a train was
coming into the city from the west. I
looked at the gates in front of me, but
they were open, why I cannot tell as they
should have been closed. The gateman
was imt In sight, and as I got two bells
from the conductor, the signal to go
ahead, I started. It was less than half a

BIG UPHEAVAL
TO OCCUR AT
SAN QUENTIN
Contention That Either Director Ray or
Fitzgerald Holds Office Ille
gally.
Governor Budd Follows a Precedent Condemned
by the Attorney General â Hale and
Birlem on the List.
ACCORDING to the seers of the Re
publican party, San Quentin Trison
â¢ will witness a lightning- change act
in the heads of departments about
the Ist day of next April. The staff of
gubernatorial advisers has for some time
done a deai of thinking and planning in
order to â be better represented on the
Board of Directors, and it is now decided
! that an irregularity of appointment will
permit a Democrat to be replaced by a
Republican. This bolt will fall on either
President Fitzgerald or Director Ray.
The law on the subject is that the Gov
ernor shall appoint Directors as vacancies
occur. . In 1592 Governor Markham ap
| pointed Mark D. Ivory to succeed Charles
i Sonntag about eighteen months before
j the latter's term expired. AVhen Gover
| r.or Budd came into office he submitted
the question of the legality of this pro
cedure to Attorney General Fitzgerald.

Dr. Coffey hurried to Schumacher's
home. an<i found the entire familyâ Mr.
Schumacher, his wife, a daughter of 14
years, a son of 10 years and an infant
aped s monthsâ all vomiting and appar
ently suffering untold agonies. Mr. Schu
macher informed the physician, between
his intervals of Buffering, that in his
opinion all had been poisoned by partak
ing <>f cake colored with cochineal. Reme
dies were administered, and although all
showed some signs of improvement before
Dr. Coffey left the place, all continued
vomiting at intervals throughout the day.
Last evening they were somewhat better,
and it is thought that all danger of death
is past, but still their cases are serious.
Dr. Coffey believes that the suffering
was caused by ptomaine poison from old

block to the crossing, and I soon reached
the op^n space where I could look down
to the right. To my horror I saw a train
running toward the crossing at good
speedâ to me, frightened as I was. it
seemed thirty miles an hour. Just then
the conductor of my car. Reichsteiner,
gave the signal to stop. I loosened the
grip, threw the brake on full force and
sprang back. The pilot of the engine
struck my car just in front of the for-
ward truck, tho Krip snapped off in the
Blot and 1 was hurled over the dummy

and received ;i severe shaking up and
several bruises, but think 1 am fortunate
that I escaped with ruy life. Twu young
men were seated on tho dummy, but be
fore the crash came they leaped from
the car and ran to the sidewalk, escaping
Uninjured."
In his story Hawes tells all he remem
bers, but he omits a few of the most im
portant details. AVhen the engine of the
special struck the dummy and the Krip
snapped off the car was lifted bodily from
the rails and hurled several feet back
alonp and directly across both tracks,
which blocked the road for an hour. Five
or six women were seated inside the shel
tered portion of the car. The shock came
so suddenly that they were thrown over
one another to the lloor of the car and
all sustained bruises and scratches. They
were assisted from the car and immedi
ately placed on inbound cars or sent to
their homes by the enerpetic railway em
ployes, but not until after all their names
and addresses had been ascertained.
Hawes was taken to his home In the pa
directly contrary to the ruling of At
torney General Fitzgerald, and it is con
tended that one of the appointments
must be wrong; if the Governor has the
riffht to till vacancies before they occur.
Ivory is entitled to the position now held
by Fitzgerald, and if he has not, then
Ray has no right to the directorate. It is
given as the opinion of a politician
familiar with the facts that the Attorney
General's opinion will stand the test of
law and that Ray is the marked man.
It is known that Warden Hale, despite
the continual illness with which he has
been afflicted, is desirous of retaining his
position. According to the same author
ity, he is marked for slaughter. Cap
tain Ed^ar. who is a wealthy man, has
expressed himself as tired of the onerous
duties of captain of the yard and will
soon retire to a life of ease and quiet
The warden and Captain.. Edgar, it is as
serted, have never worshiped each other
since the strike of two years ago, at
which time they quarreled "over a ques
tion of policy as regards subduing unruly
prisoners.
It is further declared that in all prob
ability Captain BirlenVs services will be
dispensed with at the time of the ex
pected upheaval in order to make room
for another whose claim is stronger. This
means that the entire force of petty of

is impossible to tell. He treated the pa

rear of the house and discovered the dead
body of his wife hanging from the banis

Albert Ryder, a teamster, was hooked at

promise of marriage anil battery. i
Yesterday morning Mrs. Hawkins. 43
Jessie street, complained at the Southern

trayed her young daughter. Lizzie O'Con
nor, was about to leave the city, and she
wanted him arrested. ODea was detailed
to make the arrest, and he went to the
Hawkins residence to see the girl. He
was fortunate in finding Ryder there. He
had called to demand $10 from the girl to
enable him to leave the city, and he
promised to return and marry her as soon
as she got over her trouble.
OT)ea eot Ryder outside and placed him
under arrest. He Is a powerful young
fellow ami at once showed flght. He
struck ODea on the mouth, cutting his
upper lip open and knocking off his hat.
He broke away from the officer and ran,
pursued by the hatless ODea, for several
blocks. He finally took refuge in the
basement of a house on Minna street,
near First, and there the fight was re
newed. James Burns, a carpenter, went
to O'Dea's assistance and enabled him to
put the handcuffs on Ryder.
Ryder had been living with Mrs. Alma
Duiinadieu at 2* First street, and It was
ascertained that they were to be married
in Stockton to-day, and Ryder wanted to
borrow the $10 from the O'Connor girl to
enable him to go to Stockton and marry
Mrs. Dunnadieu.

SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 2.â After a hotly
contested frame on the loral gridiron the
