OF THE GOOD RED GOLD IT BORE
SWINDLED MINERS WHO STILL
CURSE THE MAN FROM MEXICO
'â â  â  -
Beat Them ill Out of Their
.."J Money.
A Millionaire's Subterfuge to
Save the Payment of His
Board Bill.
Possible Answer to the Anxious Query,
a Where Are the Lost Books of
the Ex-Secretary of
State?"
IT ls possible to show some intellect
and perhaps courage in robbing the
rich in niching a mine or looting a
â but to steal from a poor
man is petty larceny, and of that
do the miners of the old Centennial
convict Dan Burns.
It was the pettiest of. petty larceny
that they charge against the aspirant
for a seat in the Senate â the common
est trick of the professional beat. He
took their work and defrauded them of
their pay, and in his hurry to escape
their demands he Jumped his board bill
like a penniless tramp and rode out of
the country with a sack full of gold.
The Centennial mine was near Yan
kee Jim, one of the old mining towns of
Placer County, and in 1883 one of the
liveliest. It was an old mine and two
companies had tried to make something
out of it, but they ended In turning it
over to the Napoleon Mining Company
in 1879. The company was capitalized
for $10,000,000, and Dan Burns owned
24,700 of Its 46,000 shares. It took hold
of the mine, and under^T.H. Reynolds
it was run for three years. Then
Burns was made superintendent about
the beginning of 1883.
Burns lasted Just as long as he
thought he could beat the men out of
their pay and then he closed the mine
down. ' It was on one of his periodical
trips to the mine that he finished mat
ters in a manner. truly his own. He
used to stop with Old Man Lowell, who
lived in Yankee Jim, a mile and a half
from the mine and on the road to Col
fax. He always stopped there instead
of at the hotel, and Lowell's still un
receipted bill for board for man and
horse explains why. he did so. He usu
ally brought one and sometimes two
friends with him, but on the last occa
sion he came alone. He said he wanted
to make a clean-up of the mill while
he was there, and Bill McCoy and
Charlie Dewey, his foreman and under
superintendent, assisted him in doing
this. It took them a good part of the
day, and then Burns called for his
team and piled the proceeds of the
clean-up into' the buggy.
With the gold under the seat and his
whip in his hand, Burns turned to
Dewey, his assistant. "Close down the
mine to-night, Charlie," he called to
him, and started his team. It was the
first intimation the miners had that
their work was to cease, and but one
had presence of mind enough to inquire
about their pay. "I'll send it up from
the city when I get there," was Burns'
quieting promise, and that was the
last Yankee Jim saw or heard of him.
The Centennial mine was not a big
paying property, and much of the
State's good red gold had gone into it,
for Burns was Secretary of State when
he jumped his board bill at Lowell's
and left a crown of miners in Yankee
Jim sighing for the dollars he owed
them. There were sixteen or eighteen
of them, and some of them are still in
Yankee Jim in various stages of pov
erty and still cursing the man from
Mexico and his broken promises. Their
bills amount to but a drop in the
bucket of a $10,000,000 corporation, but
they are still unpaid, and there is no
likelihood of their being paid.
As manager, of the mine the men
looked to Burns for their money and
him they held responsible when it was
not paid. He owed Lowell $74 25, of
which $20 was for board and horse feed;
he owed Adam Duncan, who still refers
to him feelingly as a "thief," $66. Dun
can worked two months for the mine
and during the last twenty-two days
of this Burns managed the property.
Duncan was paid for all his work but
the last twenty-two days," and , to "Mr.
Burns alone is the doubtful honor of
beating him out of his pay. -Duncan is
keeping the only hotel in . Yankee Jim
now. The place is not the roaring,
reckless, riotous town it was years ago,
and $66 would come handy to the old
man now â but Burns needs it for his
Senatorial fight, and Duncan is poor
anyhow. - â '.'yy .y%
Old Jim Mcintosh was another. Mc
intosh was a wood-chopper then, and
was rightly called Old Jim, even back
in '83. He was paid for his wood until
Burns took hold. He received one
small payment from the' mine-owner
for one lot of wood, and then he made
the mistake of delivering more. He is
still looking for the money. His last
lot, he says, was worth $100, and he
put in a bill for that, but he had his
trouble and the price of a new ax for
his pains. He lives alone now in a lit
tle shanty in what was once a prom
inent street in Yankee Jim. He still
lives by the swing of his ax, but min
ers in Yankee Jim have been cutting
their own wood lately and the old
man's living is not a trifling question,
In his present condition be would glad
ly forego the pleasure of representation
in the Senate by Burns if he could only
get that money. It would be almost a
fortune to him â but Burns needs
it.
A. F. MeCollam is another. He has a
bill for $101 50 against the mine. He
has been down for three years with
rheumatism and he has a wife and five
children to support. He has more use
for a hundred dollars than Burns, and
he can put It to a better use â but he
does not vote for Senator and the claim
still stands unpaid. â¢'., '.; â  'â  ','..-r
Bill Smalley was beaten out of $108;
E. H. Lowell out of $48; John McCoy,
$66; John Mills, $49; Michael Clark, $52;
William Stone, $60; Charles McCoy, $55;
William McCoy, $72; John Hubbell, $24;

Roberts, $60; M.. J. Pendergrass, $78; A.
M. MeCollam, $69, and there were sev
eral more. They were all similar sums,
large enough for miners to look forward
to and count on and live on, but lumped
together not equal to what a decent
millionaire would spend in a year's
charity; and the corporation, with
Burns owner cf more than half the
stock/had a capital of ten millions.
' Some of the miners assigned their
claims to Dewey and he brought suit
for their money, but others, appre
ciating the Burns characteristics, spent
their time searching for a suitable word
to describe him. Some wrote to him.
but he was. busy reducing the surplus
in the vaults of the office of Secretary
of State, and when their,, patience gave
out, and they wrote again, he had gone
out of office, the clink of his gold sug
gesting the clanking of chains, but he
was not so wealthy as he had been.
Dewey's suit was brought in Depart
ment 4 of the Superior Court of San
Francisco. In it he Included all the di
rectors of the corporation and demand
ed from them a total of $1818 75. This
included besides the claims of the. min
ers the claims of J. H. : White, a team
ster, and L. Render, who furnished
supplies, not knowing the financial pos
sibilities of Mr. Burns. :
.The complaint had hardly been filed
before all the defendants except Burns
and Thomas R. Hayes paid - with a
promptness which indicated a first
knowledge <of the debt, and the pay
ment of each is now on record in the
County Clerk's office in this city. That
was back in 1883, but the miners have
seen none of the money yet.* This al
lowed all but Burns and Hayes to drop
out of the suit, and it reduced Burns'
actual legal indebtedness to $864 50 and
Hayes' . to $37 30. The suit against them
was tried and on December 21, 1883,
judgment j was given for the plaintiff.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 13, 1891.
A. F. MeCollam Esq., Forest Hill, Cal.â
Dear Sir: Your letter of 7th inst in re
gard to the Napoleon Mining Company is
received and contents duly noted. I was
a one-tenth owner in said company and
am perfectly willing to pay my proportion
of those old debts, notwithstanding that
they are outlawed: ' VV
I do this not because of your threat of
publication, but for the reason that I be
lieve it just and right. Yours respectful
ly, D. M. BURNS.
G.
It was a deeper sarcasm than even
the miners knew. He owned nearly
25,000 of the 46,000 shares of the ten
million-dollar corporation, yet to beat
the miners out of their little dollars
he said he owned "one-tenth." He
â¢said he was willing to pay, yet he knew
there stood an unsatisfied judgment
against him which he had evaded and
crossed like a fishwife dodging her ac
count at the corner grocery; and to add
to it all he said the claims were right
and just. w
No wonder old Adam Duncan jumps
into the road at the mention of Dan
Burns' name and snouts: "He's a
thief! A thief, I say! Some may be
afraid of him, but I'm not. He's a
thief, and if he dared come back to
Yankee Jim I'd tell him so right here."
The records show that Burns was
properly served with the complaint in
the 'proceedings against him, and he
had ample knowledge of the trial. He
did not think the claims right enough
or just enough to stop the suit and pay,
nor did he show any more willingness
after the judgment was rendered than
before. He thought to fool the miners
and save a little more money to add to
the seven figures of his 111-gotten bank
balance, or perhaps it was just his na
ture. He may be able to beat the hotel
men of Washington, as he did Lowell,
and cinch Government employes, as he
did his minersâ he should get to the
Senate and he may want the miners'
money to use in his fight for fame.
The Centennial mine was not a pay
ing speculation for Burns either in rep
utation or a financial aspect. He was
Secretary of State during all the time
he was an owner of the mine, and
many a dollar that started honestly for
the State Treasury found its way down
the shaft of the Centennial; then wish
ing to save some of his loot, he took
charge of ' the mine himself and
squeezed the miners for the few hard
earned dollars due them. ,
He never brought any money up to
the mine, but he brought other things.
Reynolds, his chief deputy in the Sec
retary of State's office, was at one time
his assistant superintendent at the
mine, and when Reynolds made his
periodical visits to Yankee Jim he often
brought with him big account books
leather bound, official-looking and sug
gestiveâand over these Burns or Rey
nolds would pore until far into the
night. They were not the books of the
mme those were at Yankee Jim al
ready, and it was a source of specula
tion among the miners as to what ac
counts' had to be hauled over the Placer
hills to be inspected in the privacy of a
mining camp.
It was after all this that John P.
Dunn, State Controller, in writing of
Burns' defalcation while Secretary- of
State, and setting forth the difficulty of
getting evidence of fraud, wrote:
"Not one of the books in which were
entered the daily transactions of the of
fice can be found."
And farther on in his report he wrote,
referring to the books which Reynolds
"It !s a remarkable fact that the
daily journal and private cash book
mentioned above should now be miss-
Perhaps if he had visited Yankee Jim
he might have heard something about
them. . ,
â¢ Burns' memory is a green one in
Yankee Jim. The miners keep him in
mind and watch for the returns from
the joint ballot and exult in the pros
pect of his defeat. They don't want a
swindler of miners to represent the
mmmg -interests in the halls of Con
gress. They don't . want a petty lar
cenist to refer to honest men and say
"my constituents."' a v : :
THE FENDER BILL
FAILED TO PASS
CALL HEADQUARTERS, SACRA
MENTO, Feb. Senator Braunhart'a
"fender bill" came up before the Senate
this morning on its third reading and final
passage, but failed to get a constitutional
majority. Senator Braunhart changed
his vote from aye to no. and gave notice
that on Monday he would move for a re
consideration of the vote.
The measure provides that all street
cars shall be equipped with life-saving
fenders and brakes that will stop a car
abruptly in cases of emergency. It has
been hotly contested from the time it
was first introduced, though the contest
ing element has not been in the majority.
The consideration of the bill this morning
did not bring forth much in the way of
argument, but Braunhart was ready and
made a hard fight to change the result.
After the first vote he called for a call of
the absentees, of which there were eight,
and finally demanded a call of the house
and the doors were closed. Only two
votes were gained by it, however, and
the bill failing to get the necessary
twenty-one was declared lost.

MENTO, Feb. 4.â The touts that crowd
ed the corridors of the Golden Eagle
Hotel a few days ago have vanished.
Many went to San Francisco -wn the
early morning train to-day and others
took their departure this afternoon.
The chief of the corral, Colonel Burns,
is prepared now to spring his last card,
which is a peculiar document, bearing
the printed signatures of sixty-four
San Francisco mercantile firms. The
"last card" sets forth in' a preamble ad
dressed to nobody that Burns -"would
not make any mistakes if elected to
the United States Senate.
The "card" is what might be called
a Herrin masterpiece. The influence
which obtained the signatures no doubt
emanated from the yellow building. As
the card bears date January 26 it is
fair to assume that Herrin has been
working ever since that time to get
merchants to lend the use of their firm
names to the paper.
So far as can be ascertained to-night
the "card" will not affect the vote of
any member of the Legislature. On
the contrary it is already exciting de
rision on account of the indefinite and
peculiar phraseology cf the prefatory
sentences.
Very little interest attached to the

Amendments to the Law

if it is passed will have the effect of
giving to newspaper men and proprie

relates to the law of libel and amends
th.- Civil Code by adding two new sec
tions as follows:
Section 3295. No exemplary or punitive
damages shall be received in any action
brought for publication of a libel in any
newspaper in this State, unless the plain
tiff shall, before .'ing suit, give notice
in writing to the defendant to publish a
retraction or correction of the libel, and
before bringing suit allow the defendant
a reasonable time in which to publish
such retraction or correction. Proof of
publication of such retraction or correc
tion shall be admissible In mitigation of
damages, provided that the retraction or
correction shall be published in as con
spicuous a place in such newspaper as
was the -libel.
Section 3296 provides that in any action
brought for the publication of a libel in
any newspaper in the State the plaintiff
shall recover only actual damages If it
shall appear at the trial of such action
that such publication was made in good
faith and without actual malice or Hl
will and that there was reasonable
grounds for believing that the statements
set forth in such, publication were sub

correction was made as provided in the

VAGRANT BILL SENT
TO THIRD READING
CALL HEADQUARTERS. SACRA
MENTO, Feb. 4.â Senator Nutt's bill,. de
nying the right of trial by jury to .vag
rants and. others charged with petty of
fenses, came up to-day as a special order
in the Senate.
Senator Curtin claimed. that he had not
intended to speak, upon the bill, but the
remarks which had been made upon the
proposed new law forced him to oppose
the proposition to deny the right of trial
by jury to any citizen of : the United
States, be his position in life howsoever
humble.
Senator Doty ln speaking in opposition
to the bill stated that he had had an ex
perience of his own. While he was run
ning a threshing machine he had slept un
der the "broad canopy of heaven." Asso
ciation with men who might be termed
tramps or vagrants had led him to be
lieve that they should not all be classi
fied as such without any discrimination.
Some of them, he contended, might be
honest men, wandering about seeking em
ployment. In closing his remarks Sena
tor Doty made this statement:
"I wonder that the workingmen of Cali
forniaâand by the term workingman I re
fer to every citizen who is compelled from
day to day to labor for his livelihood
are as patriotic- as they are. Every bill
or at least,- almost every bill, Introduced
in this Legislature is for the protection of
capital. They tell us that unless the bill
is passed the Investment of capital in the
State will be absolutely estopped.
"Yet, here a bill is proposea that takes
away from a few of our citizens who are
unfortunate and have neither money nor
friends, the right of trial by jury. To
pass this law would put a stigma upon
the State, and I am unalterably opposed
to it."
In his speech Senator Doty referred to
Senator of Santa Barbara. He as
serted that he had made a campaign In '.
which he had claimed that aijy matter
coming up concerning the general wel
fare of the workingmen he would favor. |
Yet he now came In the Senate and fa
vored the adoption of a bill which would !
deny to some workingmen the right of \
trial by jury.
Senator Boyce turned on Senator Doty
and said: "The gentleman comes hero
and says that in my campaign I went
through my district and patted the labor
ing man on the back. Thank God that j
may occur some fine noonday . when
forty members of the Legislature are

where absentees friendly to some par
i ticular candidate could unexpectedly
I appear on the scene for a second ballot
and get within a few votes of the win
ning number.
The Burns programme for next week
j can hardly be disguised. The colonel
i will persevere a few days longer in his
| efforts to obtain a secret caucus. In
I some quarters the opinion is expressed
| that the outward sign of weakness in
: the Burns fold is a trap to lure the fol

"But? the spur seems to touch," smiled
Senator Doty. v;- ! '
"It does touch, â  but I am indifferent.
Our mutual opinions of each other are
well known," replied Senator Boyce.
Senator Shortridge spoke strongly
against the bill, and the previous question
was called In order to shut off debate.
When it came to a ballot to pass the
bill to third reading and final passage the
vote stood 16 to 14 that it do not pass.
As it requires. twenty-one votes to defeat
a motion made in that form.* the bill was

PENSION FOB PALMER.
The Veteran Office Holder to Get
Fifty Dollars a Month. -
WASHINGTON, Feb. 4.-The House
Committee on Invalid Pensions to-day re
ported favorably the Senate bill pension
ing General John M.' Palmer of Illinois,
the amount being reduced from $100 to $50.
The report says of General Palmer:
"Nearly always' an officeholder and al
ways strictly honest, he finds himself
now, In his seventy-second year, retired
to private life without means of Income,
broken in health, blind in one eve and
rapidly losing the sight of the other."
The report then refers to Mr. Palmer's
service at the head of the Senate Pension
Committee, his liberal treatment of I th*
old soldiers and yet his opposition to
'â¢large sentimental pensions, based on
social position and political pull.'" -
Under such circumstances, the report
states, $50 per month is all that General
Palmer himself will approve. Accom
panying the report are letters and affl
dlvlts showing General Palmer's feeble
condition. . "â  ~

REDDING, Feb. 4.â District Attorney
Thomas B. | Dozier has spread dismay |in
the tenderloin district of this town by an
nouncing his determination to clear the
quarter of its denizens. ' The district Is
almost in j the heart of the town, , directly
In the pathway of f pupils going to * and
from the public schools. A raid was made
on the district and all of the residents
placed under arrest, either, on charges of
vagrancy; or for selling liquor without â  a
license. The cases against a number of
the women arrested on vagrancy charges
were dismissed upon the promises that
they would leave their present quarters
and not return. '
The District Attorney says that whether
he can secure a conviction or not, .he will
cauje arrests and re-arrests, entailing on
the obstinate offenders never-ending at
torney's fees and bail money until they
shall be glad to remove themselves from
the forbidden district. ,
The element that is fighting the District
Attorney has threatened to fill the va
cated houses with Chinese from San
Francisco. Application has been made to
the Chinese Consul in San Francisco to
Invoke protection from Washington for
the Celestials that may be imported. This
is deemed necessary because Redding was
one" of the three towns in California that
expelled their Chinese population about
thirteen years ago. From that day to
this Chinese have not found lodgment in

effort to colonize the tenderloin with
Celestials be persisted in. â â â

.CINCINNATI, Feb. 4.-The largest
crowd since' John L. Sullivan and Dom

the boxing contest at. the Stag Athletic
Club arena here to-night. The main at
traction was a 15-round go between "Aus
tralian Jimmy" Ryan and Joe Walcott,
"the black demon," at catch weights, for
a purse of $1500. Tom O'Rourke was Wal
cott's chief' adviser and second. John. Mur
phy of Cincinnati was referee.
Walcptt was the aggressor during the
entire contest, Ryan continually clinch
ing. The contest was tame, as Ryan laid
hack for a. knockout with his right. In the
fourteenth round both men rushed at each
other and landed, hard body blows with
.the right. In the break-away , Walcott
landed a hard left swing on Ryan's chin,
flooring him. Ryan took nine seconds of
the count and upon arising rushed to a
clinch. Walcott pushed him from- him
and, swinging a hard left, landed on the
jaw and again sent Ryan to the floor. The
latter got to a sitting position, .but the
referee, seeing he was helpless, stopped
the contest and awarded the decision to
.Walcott. â :,-.
NEW SPECIES OF
FISHES AND REPTILES
Stanford University Receives a Valu- |
able Collection From South
"'".â â¢' crn Mexico.
; STANFORD UNIVERSITY, . Feb. 4.â
I J." O. Snyder, Instructor in. zoology; re
-1 turned from Mexico yesterday with one of i
i the most desirable collections -cf ' fishes j
\ and reptiles that the . university has ever j
I received. During most jof his six weeks'
: tour Mr. Snyder was accompanied by : Dr. |
i Jordan. Together they fished in a number j
;of â¢ streams which J had never, before been
; visited by any naturalist. They were re- j
: warded by finding a great" number, of rare >
specimens and at least seven kinds of fish ;
I that are entirely new to science. .
I The new species have not yet been stud- j
i led. They will be classified at once. j
Among them is a large catfish belonging â¢
to a new type. It is a style of fish that ;
! was not supposed to exist. Another of the
: new types is a small minnow with a i
j bright red belly. -It was found farther j
I south than any minnow known. Two of :
'the unclassified fishes belong to the sun
fish variety. . Another is similar to the >
goby, but Is an entirely unfamiliar type. ,
j _ The collection contains over 150 valu
.: able specimens. The fish were caught
with a seine for I the : most . par t in the
' rivers that flow toward the two oceans.
f Some were got from the lakes, notably* ;
Lake Chapala, the largest fresh water ;
lake In Mexico. The River Ixtla, which [
is one of the streams new to scientific.
j collectors, ; furnished many of the most !
: valuable specimens.- '--'â¢'-
The chief reason that makes the fishes !
j obtained by this tour , of peculiar value
I to the zoologist is in the fact that South- j
crn Mexico represents : the curious meet- j
ing place of the South American and
North American varieties. â¢
Mr. Snyder has already gone to work
to prepare and study this valuable addi- j
! tion to .the . zoology museum, so that* a i

LATEST DESPERATE EFFORT OF THE
RAILROAD TO ASSIST DAN BURNS
PROVES TO BE A GENUINE FAILURE
SUCCEEDED IN SECURING SIXTY** !
FOUR NAMES ON A TESTIMONIAL
Descended to the Use of
False Signatures.
j.dam Andrew, Henry Crocker
and Mose Gunst Were
Tonters.
Some of the Names Were Signed "for
Business" Reasons and Others
to "Oblige a Friend."
THESE are desperate times in the
camp of one Dan Burns, who is
wildly endeavoring to force the
legislators of this State to "vin
dicate" him by making him
United States Senator because the hon
est press of the commonwealth has had
the temerity to publish his criminal
record.
During the past two weeks the touts of
the Mexican outcast have declared that
whenever the occasion made it neces
sary the required pressure would be
applied and that the needed votes
would be forthcoming:. These allega
tions were supposed by many to be
backed up by the power to deliver
the goods, and everybody Interested in
the contest was curious to know what
particular pull Mr. Burns had up his
sleeve.
The "reserve force" has been discov
ered, and its revelation shows the
straits to which the Southern Pacific
Company has been put to promote the
cause of its disreputable candidate.
The work is so coarse that it plainly
discloses the raw handiwork of Man
Friday Herrin. Mr. Burns is credited
with possessing more political sense
than to adopt such boomerang methods,
but he Is in the hands of the railroad
corporation and must sink or swim
with them in the fight they are mak
ing to put him i * the position where he
is not wanted by the people of Cali
fornia.
Mr. Herrin ran away with the idea
that by circulating a petition among
business houses of San Francisco that
patronize the company and are at its
mercy, it would be possible, through
the pulling of divers wires, to secure a
broadside of signatures that would
force the Legislature to appoint a
Southern Pacific Senator. The scheme
was a fiat failure, for out of a popula
tion of about 360,000 the tools of the
corporation succeeded in inducing sixty
four men in the community to put' their
names to a document setting forth that
the State would not be disgraced by
electing Dan Burns Senator. The rea
sons given by these sixty-four lone
some individuals for placing them
selves in such an unenviable light will
be read with deep interest by the peo
ple of California.
"This unique document was forced up
on these members of the community,
principally by Adam Andrew, president
of the Shasta Mineral Water Company,
which is a pet enterprise of the South
ern Pacific, founded by the late Colonel
Fred Crocker, and in which Burns is
said to be a large stockholder. Added
to this branch of the railroad push was
Mr. Burns' partner in the promotion of
gambling schemes, known to fame as
Mose Gunst, Police Commissioner, ap
pointee of ex-Governor Markham. Mr.
Gunst, Democrat, pushed his face into
th** business of making a Republican
Senator, and by divers and sundry
means secured several names. What
guarantees were given to shippers as
to future freight rates will probably
never be known, and why certain mem
bers of the shipping trade went around
and mad.* the request to sign the paper
a percona! matter is another feature
with which the public will probably
not be made acquainted.
Some of the signers were frank
enough to say that they did not want
to attach their signatures and that they
were Sorry they did so; others that they
did not think it would have any effect:
others that they were indebted to
Burns for favors done in years past,
and others wanted to see some
thing done at Sacramento.
The anxiety of the promoters of the
document to make a fair showing is
illustrated by the fact that in two in
stances at least the names were for
geries, .namely In the case of Willard
Bros, and Brigham, Hoppe & Co., the
well-known provision dealers of this
city. In the case of the latter the fine
Italian hand of Mose Gunst appears.
Mr. Hoppe's statement is not good
reading for gambling partner Gunst or
the other people whose names appear
en the list. Mr. Hoppe said: "Mose
Gunst was canvassing sentiment in our
neighborhood in San Francisco, but
Brigham, Hoppe & Co. certainly gave
him so encouragement."
The annexed Interviews with the
â¢signers of the Burns" political bill of
ill health will enable legislators to de
term In* the value to be attached to the
document as representing the senti
ment of the business community of San
Francisco:
.. J. EPPINGERâ I signed the paper
at the solicitation of Henry Garten,
who brought it to me. I did not look
into the matter. I merely did it as a
favor to Garten. I am now sorry that
I did so.
B. SWEITZER, senior member of the
firm of Sweitztr & Co.â l do not know
who signed the petition. If our name
is there then ny brother must have
signed, If I had been present no such
pignature would, have been written. I
don't care to have my business men
tioned in connection with politics or
have it mixed tp in the Senatorial
fight in any manner whatever.
F. E. BRIGHAM of Brig
ham, Hoppe&Co. â Our firm
has acknowledged no such
action and anj appearance
of our, name is unauthor
ized and absolutely contra
ry to our wishes. Mose
Gunst was canvassing the
sentiment in our neighbor-
hood, but I can say no
member of this firm gave
him any encouragement.
THOMAS KIRKPATRICK of the
Jesse Moore, TTunt & Co.â signed for
both the firm and myself as a personal
matter of friendship to Burns; also for
a favor done to me by Mr. Burns in the
past.
T. COHN, bookkeeper with Rinaldo
Bros.â l signed the petition with the
knowledge and consent of the firm. I
thought it amounted to nothing. I
simply thought that if the members of
the Legislature selected no other man
there would be no harm in electing
Burns.
B. D. PIKE of B. D. Pike & Co.â l
signed for the firm. I thought the
deadlock ought to be broken. Besides
I have known D. M. Burns for twenty
five years. I would rather see De
Young elected, but next to him I would
just as soon see Burns win. I don't
think he would be a bad man for Cali
fornia. However, I don't particularly
care who gets it.

quaint;*nee, and I signed it as a matter
of business. General Barnes is my
choice. I would tell you more about it,
| but cannot for publication. I guess
most of the signatures were obtained
j under the same conditions â simply _ a
i business proposition. I really don't
care a d who is elected United
, States Senator. Business is business
I with me. I cannot tell you for publi
j cation who presented the petition. I
signed because I was asked to do so.
J. C. JOHNSON & CO.â E. H. HOR
TONAs president and manager of J.
C. Johnson & Co. I signed the peti
tion . for the election of Daniel i Burns
to the United Stales Senate. I signed
the petition several days ago and did
so at the request of Adam Andrew,
president of the Shasta Mineral Water
Company. I have no objections to slat
â  ing why I signed the document. When
J. C. Johnson died he left an estate to
which there were a number of heirs.
Mr. Andrew married one of the heirs
and is practically one of the family.
He and Mr. Burns are personal friends,
and when Mr. Andrew asked for the
signature of the J. C. Johnson Com
pany to his petition in behalf of Mr.
Burns the family and 1 saw no reason
why the request should be denied, and
as the president of the company I
added the name of the firm to the peti
tion. As I stated it was purely a fam
ily matter and politics cut no figure in
the case, although politically I am a
Republican.
SOMERS & CO.â A. SOMERSâ
signed the petition at the request of
Mr. Adam Andrew, a partner of D. M.
i Burns in the Shasta Mineral Water
Company. I am unacquainted with
Mr. Burns, but affixed my signature to
the paper handed me because of' my
friendship for Mr. Andrew and
because I saw the names of
well known business men of
this city attached to the paper.
When you ask me whether I am in fa
vor of Mr. Burns, you place me in a
j peculiar attitude. You know when a
friend comes to you and asks you to
; sign a petition you can't very well re
fuse him. Mr. Andrew did not explain
to me why he wanted me to sign it,
| but simply recommended Mr. Burns to
me as a gentleman who has been treat
ed unkindly and asked it as a favor that
j I sign my name. As I said before, I
j do not know Mr. Burns, and all I know
of him is what I have read in the news
â  papers. I do know Mr. Andrew and
esteem him highly. Our firm sells him
a great deal of hay and grain, and as it
was a favor, to him, I granted his re
quest. By giving you the facts in the
matter I don't want you to quote me so
!it will hurt my business. I am a Re
publican.
SPLIVALO C. R. CO.â C. R. SPLI
VALOâA friend of mine handed me
the paper and asked me to sign it and
1 did so. I had no interest whatever in
the matter. He gave me no particular
j reasons why I should affix my signature
!to the paper; he simply asked me to
, sign it as a matter of friendship to
him. I don't care to give the name of
the gentleman who brought the petition
!to me. I did not take any interest in
: the. matter and did not sign out of
friendship for Mr. Burns.
W. S. KITTLEâ Mr. Henry Crocker
brought the petition around to me and
I added my signature to it. I know-
Mr. Burns and believe he would make
a strong representative in the Senate.
I am a member of the Republican party
and would feel satisfied if Mr. Burns
were chosen.
COGHILL & KOHN.â T. B.
COGHILLâ I wish it clearly
understood that I have not
signed any petition favor
ing anybody for United
States Senator. If my
name appears on any such
petition it is a forgery.
WILLARD BROTHERS
JULES WILLARDâ I never
signed the firm's name to
the paper in question. am
a Democrat and do not con
sider that I have any right
to interfere in Republican
politics. If I had any dis
position to support Burns'
candidacy I would not have
signed the firm name, but
my own as a personal mat
ter, for I strongly depre
cate the idea of business
concerns meddling in poli
tics. Since my brother in
forms you that he did not
sign the petition, and I
know positively that 1 did
not, it is evident that the
signature does not repre
sent the firm nor its indi
vidual members with re
gard to the Senatorial
aspirations of Dan Burns,
and, therefore, the signa
ture has no weight as far
as we are concerned.
GEORGE A. KOHN of COGHILL &
KOHNâ I do not remember of ever
having signed such a petition and could
not positively say whether I did or not
unless I saw that signature alleged to
be mine. '_ However, I certainly do not
prefer to see Burns a Senator, as Mr.
Scott is my choice first, last and all the
time. I would have no hesitancy in
trusting the affairs of this State in
his hands. I repeat that I have no recol
lection of ever signing anything in
favor of the election of Burns.
JOSEPH M. O'BRIEN of the firm of
O'Brien & Sons, carriage manufactur
ers, Polk and Golden Gate avenue, was
asked by a friend to sign the petition
and requested that nothing be said of
it as he feared it would make enemies
for him. -He -would - not state under
what conditions he signed it nor his
reasons for doing so.
FIDELITY MUTUAL AID ASSO-
CIATIONâ J. L. M. Shetterley. secre
tary of the Fidelity Mutual Aid Asso
ciationl signed the petition on behalf
of the firm. Three of my personal
friends came to me and asked me to do
so. Two of them were men who would
do any favor for me and I would do
anything for them. When I stated that
I was a Democrat they asked me as a
citizen and not as a partisan to sign
the thing and I did so. Burns is not
my choice. There are other men whom
I would rather see in the halls of na
tional legislation, but as they are not
prominent in the fight I did not con
sider that I was harming any one.
H. LEVI of the firm of H.
LEVI & CO., grocers, at 117-119
Market streetâ l did not sign the pe
tition nor do I know anything of it
whatever. Jacob Levi Sr., the other
member of the firm, stated emphatical
ly that he had never heard of the peti
tion before.
ED W. MCCARTHY of the firm of
MCCARTHY BROS., tea and coffee im
porters, 113 Front street, declined to
discuss the matter. He said he did not
consider that the petition meant any
thing or that a person by signing It
urged the election of D. M. Burns.
"There are many other persons whom I
would rather see United States Senator
than Burns," he said.
M. J. BRANDENSTEIN of the firm
of M. J. BRANDENSTEIN & CO..
commission merchants. 118-120 Market
street â I was asked by Mr. Cluff as a
personal favor to sign the petition. I
would not have done so under other
conditions. He is a friend of*Â»mine and
I considered that I should do it for him.
So far as I am concerned, I am not in
politics and would like to have my
name left out of the affair. I might say
that at the time of signing there were
but two candidates at the top of the
list, and I considered that strength
must be thrown with one or the other
to break a deadlock, since I believed my
signature would C > no harm.
EDWARD KLAU of HAAS BROS.â
I did not sign that petition. Perhaps
some other member of the firm did, but
I do not know. Dan Burns is not my
preference for United States Senator.
I have not discussed the matter with
the other members of the firm, and do
not know their preferences.
MAURICE ROTHCHILD, president
of the Wertheimer Company, is in New
York, was there when the petition was
circulated, and consequently could not
have signed it. Morris Feintuch. sec
retary of the Wertheimer Company,
said: "I did not sign the name of our
company to that petition. I do not
know who did. Personally I have no
preference for Dan Burns. One of the
directors of the corporation may have
signed it, but in that case it would not
indicate the opinions of the others."
ACHILLE ROOS of ROOS BROS.â I
am a Democrat, but I believe a Demo
crat can sign a "petition to the Legis
lature without interfering in Repub
lican party affairs, even if the Legisla
ture is Republican. Personally I have
no preference for D. M. Burns, and the
petition does not really indicate any.
It says "without prejudice to the other
candidates." It is so loosely worded
that it means almost nothing.
FRANK D. BATES of BATES & CO.
I want to see the deadlock broken,
and while perhaps Dan Burns is no
better than the other candidates he
seems to have the best chance, and I
think he is as good as any of them.
LEON GUGGENHEIMER, of MACK
& CO.â did not sign the petition and
have really no particular choice
among the candidates. I believe, how
ever, that some member of our firm
did sign the paper, just to oblige a
friend who was circulating it l do not
remember who it was.
EDWIN B. CUTTER of CUTTER &
MOSELEYâ I have no particular in
terest in the Senatorial .fight and cer
tainly have no preference for Dan
Burns, but I signed the petition to
oblige a friend who was circulating it.
My own choice would be Irving M.
Scott or Dr. Pardee. "y'ry'
The petition was presented to George
W. McNear and strong efforts made to
induce him to add his signature, but
he absolutely refused, even when it
was urged that the signing of a petition
has but little significance.
Henry Crocker was the "friend" who
presented the petition to each of these
gentlemen.
WILLARD BROS., MORRIS
WILLARD I never signed the
name of my firm to any paper pro
mulgated in the interest of Burns'
candidacy. lam a Republican, but
I want no Dan Burns in mine, for I
don't consider that he would make a
fit representative for the State of
California. If the firm's name is
signed to the paper it was done
without my authority. The only
one besides myself who is empowered
to sign the firm name is my brother,
Jules Willard, the junior member of
the concern, and I do not think that
he would do so in a case of this kind
without consulting with me. How
ever, he may have done so on his own
responsibility as expressing his in
dividual feelings in the matter, but I
certainly was not a party to it. Had

the document been presented to me I
â would certainly have refused to sign
it, for with me it is anybody but
Burns.
HENRY J. CROCKERâ I signed the j
petition favoring Burns' candidacy for
the very reasons set forth In the paper.
Without in any way slighting the other
candidates, some of whom are my per
sonal friends, I believe that Burns
would make a creditable representative
and that the interests of the State
would not suffer in his hands. I signed
toy name partly out of friendship and
partly for the confidence which I have
at all times placed in Burns. I don't
think that any mistake will be made if
he be sent to Washington as Califor
nia's representative in the Senate.
SIGMUND GREENEBAUM. man
ager of the London, Paris and Ameri
can Bankâ l signed the paper written
ln the interest of Burns for Senator
because he is a particular friend of ;
mine. I am a Republican in politics,
and in affixing my name to the recom- I
mendation I believe that I acted for
the best interests of the party and the
State's welfare.
LOUIS CAHENâ I signed the docu
ment recommending the election of
Burns for Senator because he is a per
sonal friend of mine. It was not at the
solicitation of the Southern Pacific
Company that I affixed my signature,
though if that corporation should ask
me to subscribe to any proposition that |
would not go against the grain I would j
certainly comply with the request, be- |
cause it has always treated me prop
erly. I can safely say that I was in
fluenced simply by my personal friend- i
ship for Dan Burns, whom I have j
known many years and for whom I |
bave a great regard. I consider him
superior to some of the other candi
dates who have been mentioned, and as
a friend I believe him entitled to my
support.
MEYERSTEIN & CO., 6 Battery
street â The so-called indorsement rec
ommending Burns was signed by Alfred
L. Meyerstein, a young man just turn
ing the age of 21 years, and son of
Lewis Meyersteln, the senior member
of the firm. The young man had no j
authority from the house to put the |
firm's name to any such document, and,
furthermore, had the senior member \
been consulted, he says he would have i
objected to the firm going on record as j
indorsing a man for United States Sen- j
ator whom he does not know.
CROWN DISTILLERIES COM- i
PANY, LOUIS HAAS, Secretaryâ Our i
house signed the paper at the request |
of a buslne. *. friend who brought it in. |
No, I do not care to mention any names,
but I presume it was presented by the
same gentleman that visited other
firms in this section of the city.
JOHN A. HAMMERSMITH of HAM
MERSMITH & FIELD- Yes, I signed:
for the firm. Not that I wanted to take
any hand in the contest, but Mose j
Gunst came to me and asked as a per- i
sonai favor to sign. That Is the only
reason there is for our name appearing j
on the list.
C. W. CRAIG of C. W." CRAIG &
CO. â A business friend of mine brought
the paper to me and I signed it. I told
him at the time that I did not consider
that it amounted to anything, but at
bis solicitation attached my firm's
name. I took no particular interest in
the matter and am now sorry I signed.
I believe that one of the reasons set
forth as to why the document should be
signed was that Mr. Burns had been at
tacked by the newspapers and ought to
be vindicated.
WILLIAM WOLFF of WILLIAM
WOLFF & CO.â I signed the document
at the earnest request of a friend Mr.
Andrew of the Shasta Mineral Water
Company. No it was not because I
know anything about Burns personally,
but because I did not like to refuse the
request of a friend. That -was all the
Interest I had in the matter.
WILLIAM CLUFF of WILLIAM
CLUFF & CO.â I personally signed the
document. I believe it was presented
to me by Mr. Andrew of the Shasta
"Water Company. Yes. I think Burns
would make a good Senator. I have
lived neighbor to him a long time and
know his family very well. He is a
personal friend of mine and I had no
hesitation in signing.

MERRITT DECLINES TO
DISCUSS THE BATTLE
NEW YORK, Feb. s. General Wesley Merritt, who was in com
mand of the land forces and Military Governor of Manila at ' the
time of the American occupation, is at the Waldorf. News of the at
tack by the insurgents was sent to his room last night by a reporter,
but General Merritt declined to discuss it.
American troops has produced
so great an impression that but
little apprehension is felt as to
their ability to resist the insur
gent forces.
A consultation was held in re
gard to providing measures for
the safety of non-combatants, and
it was finally decided, in view of
the possibility of danger from
chance missiles, that asylum
should be given the women on
board the transports.
j All the American women in
; the city, and many Europeans,
\ have accordingly been placed in
safety. The transfer was accom
plished without disorder, a detail
of soldiers being provided to es
cort them to boats at the Puente
: Espano and the Old City front,
! whence they were ferried over to
! the fleet.
Occasionally a spent shot from
the insurgents'. lines falls within
! the city, a testimony to the in
ferior quality of the ammunition
with which Aguinaldo's men arc
supplied.
The greatest cheerfulness pre
vails among the American troops.
The idea of Aguinaldo's success
is not contemplated. It is known
that, although he has in the
neighborhood of 30,000 men, not j
more than half of his men are ;
! equipped in anything like a ser
| viceable manner, and it is felt that 1

FAMOUS COLTON HALL
SHOULD BE PRESERVED
MONTEREY, Feb. 4.â For the second
time in this decade an effort is being
made to interest the State in the pre
servation of and proper veneration for
old Colton Hall, the most historic build
ing in California, except perhaps Mon
terey's other celebrated landmark, the
Custom House. Mayor R. F. Johnson
of this city has been in close corre
spondence with Monterey's Assembly
man, F. P. Feliz, since the opening of
the Legislature, laying before him all
the data connected with the history of
the famous old building, the momentous
events that occurred within its walls,
its present condition and uses, and from
this material Mr. Feliz h. â¢ formulated
a bill to be presented for the considera
tion of the Legislature. The bill pro
vides for the appropriation of a cer
tain sum annually from the State fund
to complement the sum raised by the
citizens of Monterey city and county,
the entire amount to be used in keeping
the valuable old structure in a state of
preservation.
In 1893 a similar bill was presented
in the State Legislature and passed
both houses, but was vetoed by Gover

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Feb. Ethan Allen
Hitchcock, the retiring American Em
bassador to Russia, who was recently
appointed United States Secretary of
the Interior, arrived in London on his
way to Washington. He carries home
the strongest pro-Russian sympathies.
In an interview had with him by a rep
resentative of the Associated Press Mr.
Hitchcock denounced emphatically the
stories current since the beginning of
the Hispano-American war that Rus
sia was a member of the coalition of
Continental powers which would have
intervened in the dispute had England
not refused to Join them.
"These stories are utterly unfound
ed," said Mr. Hitchcock. "There has
never been a single Item of proof pro
! duced to substantiate them, and. on the
i contrary, Russia has been most friendly
I toward the United States and has
J manifested that friendship during the
I past years in many ways, of which my
j position forbids me to speak. Unfortu
; nately the Russian Government is so
j constituted that it cannot do much
talking in such cases as the present,
but can only wait for time to afford op-
I portunities for proving the truth.
"When these opportunities arise its
I friendship will be demonstrated. The
i false impressions which have arisen
j are very unfortunate and, I think, are
i largely due to the utterances of Rus
| sian newspapers, certain of which are
I popularly supposed . to be official or
. gans, whereas the supposition is ut
| terly, unfounded, as they represent the
i Government no more than independent
sections of the American press repre
sent that Government.
'â¢ "In criticizing domestic politics the
Russian papers must be most cautious,
but whet it comes to foreign affairs
they are allowed a degree of liberty
and even license which surprised me.
Of course, they say things that inter
fere with the Government's plans, and
they may be cautioned and told th?.t
they are injudicious, but ordinarily
they are entirely unhampered."
Like many persons making the ac
quaintance of the Czar, Mr. Hitchcock
has a profound admiration for the
potentate, and expresses himself
strongly as to his frankness, si lecrity
and enterprise.
After the formal presentation of his
letters of recall on Saturday last Mr.
Hitchcock had a long personal talk
with the Czar and Count Muravieff, the
Russian Foreign Minister. He scoffs
at the idea that the Czar's peace pro
paganda is inspired by any but the
highest motives. â¢ Regarding the Czar's
proposal looking to the limitation of
armaments, Mr. Hitchcock said:
"The Czar is in no wise discouraged
by the reception of his plans for check
ing the increase of armaments. He has
not any idea that he will achieve all he
desires immediately, but ls firm in the
belief that his views must prevail in
time and at a not far distant time."
Mr. Hitchcock was delayed for a fort
night by the difficulty he encountered
in arranging for a reception by the
Czar, on account of the winter festivi
ties which were in progress, and in
which the members of the royal family
participated actively, the Czar attend
| nor Markham and no further effort
! was made to bring it to life.
Colton Hall is beyond question the
, most important building in the State,
from the standpoint of the amount and
character of State history that was
made on the floors of its quaint old
j rooms. The building was begun in 1846
by a company of Mormons who came to
Monterey In that year, intending to
form a Mormon colony here, and was
flrst designed for a Mormon temple.
The funds gave out absolutely, how
ever, and the Mormons were obliged
not only to discontinue building when
little more than the foundation had been
completed, but to. dispose of the prop-
I erty in order to get means for moving
|to another locality. They went from
here, to a place near San Bernardino
] and from there drifted into Arizona or
j joined their brethren at Salt Lake.
The grounds and foundation of the
j building were bought by Rev. Walter
I Colton, the first American Alcalde of
j Monterey, and the edifice completed by
; him to be used as- a City Hall. It is
I said a large portion of the money used
in the building of It was obtained by

Last Monday evening he was asked to

Hitchcock not desiring to take a house
there so near the close of the season.
The members of the retirin- Embassa
dor's family are now in Berlin and will
spend some time in Italy and at Con

the duties of his new position immedi
ately upon his arrival in Washington.
Regarding his selection by President
McKinley as Mr. Bliss' successor, he
remarked: "My appointment was as
much a surprise to me as it could have
been to the public."
Property Owners Comply.
Chief Sullivan of the Fire Department Is
well pleased at the cheerful compliance of
property owners with the enforcement of
the fire ordinance providing fire escapes
on all buildings of three stories and over.
Over 250 notices have been served on own
ers of property in this city. Of this num
ber 80 per cent are in the district under
charge of John Willis, assistant engineer,
which comprises the commercial section
of the town. Out of the number notified
to place escapes on their buildings con
tracts have been let and work commenced
on over 175 buildings. In no case has
either Chief Sullivan or his assistants met
with refusals to comply with the ordi
nance.
It is calculated that there will be up
ward of 500 buildings provided with es
capes by the time Chief Sullivan has all
his reports collected from his assistants.

theater trip. After the .passengers
had disembarked at Clay street the
Sausalito proceeded to Powell-street
wharf and the freight cars were load
ed, after which the steamer was
taken back to Clay street to wait for
the 11:30 trip to this city.
At about 11 o'clock Melovlch left the
flreroom and strolled up and down the â¢
lower deck. He conversed with Night
Watchman Lennox and a deckhand
named Sllva for a while and then
walked off the boat with the remark
that he Intended to get a drink. That
was the last seen of him by his
friends.
Superintendent Shoemaker became
alarmed when the fireman did not ap
pear on Wednesday and communicated
with Chief Lees. Detectives were
set at work on the case, but so far no
clew has been discovered as to the
missing man's whereabouts.
"The theory of the detectives,"
said Mr. Shoemaker, "is that Melovich
was "shanghaied." They assert that
sailors are very scare and think he
was enticed Into one of the water-front
grog shops and drugged. Three deep
water ships sailed next day and he
may have been taken away on one of
them."
Many of the fireman's friends scoff
at this theory. They say he was
known to have a small sum of money
on his person when he disappeared
and that for this he was rugged,
robbed and thrown into the bay.
Melovlch's wife is nearly distracted
over her husband's disappearance and
cried bitterly to-day when discussing
it. She is left almost destitute and
with two small boys to take care or.
The railway company has promised to
provide for her, and, if it Is learned
that her husband is dead, to find her
suitable employment.

WEST PRUSSIA
Sugar Crisis Hurts the
Rhine Provinces.
CUBA IS NOW A COMPETITOR
UNITED STATES TARIFF SCHED-
ULES CAUSE PROTESTS.
Press of Berlin Dissatisfied and De-
Clare New Regulations Are
Framed at the Expense of
European Imports.
Copyrighted, 1899, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Feb. The debates in the
Prussian Diet this week were of special
terest as they brought out the full ex
tent of the Agrarian demands and
showed that the Prussian Cabinet ls
unanimous on the Agrarian question.
The Agrarian party ln the Diet is
much stronger than in the Reichstag,
and the speeches showed that even the
National Liberals support the Agrari
ans on many questions.
Herr Walbrecht, National Liberal, as
sured the Government that there was a
deep feeling of dissatisfaction caused
by the agricultural depression in West
Prussia as well as in the East and
that the sugar crisis had severely hurt
the Rhine provinces. He also expressed
the belief that Cuba, under the Ameri
cans, will quickly become a dangerous
competitor with the German sugar in
dustry and recommended the Germans
to form a sugar trust and raise home
prices.
The Agrarian leaders, Mendelsteinfels
and Yon Wagenheim, were more vio
lent, calling on the Government to abol
ish the commercial treaties and exclude
American, Russian and Austrian agri
cultural products.
There was an interesting* debate ln
the Reichstag* on the bill introduced by
Herr Rickert for the protection of the
secrecy of the ballot. The two Con
servative factions for the flrst time
openly avowed their desire to abolish
the secrecy of the ballot and Emperor
Williams friend, Baron yon Stumm,
plainly declared that sooner or later
secrecy must be abolished, at which the
whole Right loudly applauded. The
bill, however, was adopted by a large
majority, composed of the Center and
the whole of the Left.
The official Reichsanzeiger has de
nounced most of the Cuban tariff regu
lations, and the German press is great
ly dissatisfied with them, claiming the
regulations are so framed as to favor
American imports at the expense of
German and other European imports.
The Boerson Courier, the leading
commercial organ, dwells particularly
on the fact that German staple exports,
such as textiles and wines, are most un
favorably treated and concludes an ar
ticle on the subject with saying: -'The
tariff regulations made by the United
States for Cuba know nothing of the
'open door.' Surely something will have
to be said about them in the future."
The establishment of a company to
lay a direct cable between Germany
and the United States seems now
definitely assured. The capital, 20,000,
--000 marks, has been furnished by a
number of banks and private capital
ists, including the Duke of Ratibor. The
German Government is understood to
be favoring this and other cable enter
prises and the Reichstag will be asked
to make various appropriations in re
turn for pre-emption privileges.
The Deutsche Zeitung concludes an
article on t c subject as follows: "Thus
the first step Is taken to free Germany
from the British cable monopoly which,
in the event of war, might become fatal
to us."
With reference to the gambling de
bate in the Reichstag, a story is told
showing the Emperor's intense hatred
of gambling. When he was in
command of the Garde dv Corps
he strictly prohibited it and old
Emperor William asked him to with
draw his orders. But the grandson re
plied: "As long as you entrust me with
the command of the regiment I will not
do so. I would rather ask you to re
lieve me of my post."
The debates showed that in spite of
the Emperor's efforts gambling is still
much In vogue among the officers Of
the German army.
The Leipzig Xachrichten says a lot
of private letters from the late Prince
Bismarck to General yon Manteuffel
then Governor of the Reichland, con
taining spicy items of court and polit
ical gossip, were sold on Yon Manteuf
fel's death to a Berlin banker having
profitable business relations with the
Emperor and court. The banker, it is
added, paid 40,000 marks for the letters.
The Leipzig writer recently wanted to
use the letters for a historical work
and the banker at first promised to
lend them. Later, however, he refused
on the plea that it would cost him his
valuable clientele, having received an
intimation from the court chamberlain
to that effect.
The Bismarck press chronicles this
regretfully and adds that a third vol
ume- of Bismarck memoirs really ex
ists, giving sensational information re
garding the present reign. The manu
script, It appears, was sent to England
before Bismarck died.
Emperor "William this week ordered
that the park and gardens surrounding
Mon Bijou Chateau, in the center of
Berlin, be closed to the public. This
Is due to a startling incident which has
only Just become known. Last Sunday
the Emperor and Empress left the
church opposite the palace and walked
toward the carriage which was wait
ing for them just -inside Mon Bijou
Park. An Immense crowd had assem
bled and was so dense that their Majes
ties had great difficulty in reaching the
vehicle. When they succeeded In doing
SO th- coachman was unable to drive
off, being hemmed in on all sides. Thus
the Emperor and Empress were obliged
to listen to the personal comments of
the populace, and it is claimed that in
sulting epithets were flung at the im
perial couple. Finally re-enforcements
of police made a line through the
crows and their Majesties drove Off
amid hooting and catcalls.
The Emperor is er gaged in prepara
tions for public performances of a dio
rama showing the , places he visited
during his Eastern trip, the pictures
being dravn from the photographs
taken by his orders during the tour.
The performances will be given at the
Schauspielhaus and the receipts will
be devoted tc charity.
The colonel commanding the Ninety
seventh Regiment married an English
woman and wis induced by the latter
to Introduce the British fashion of offi
cers wearing civilian clothing when off
duty. He later/ Invited the officers of
his regiment to dinner, prescribing
black evening dress. This reached the
ears of the Emjeror, who reprimand
ed the colonel a.id forbade its repeti
tion. ' y -
There were forty-eight trials for lese

MURDERED IN OKLAHOMA.
Former Suisun Valley Resident Slain
for His Gold.*
SUISUN Feb. 4.â lnformation was re
ceived here to-day from J. S. Newby,
County Attorney at Chandler. O T., that
J W ' Fox, formerly employed as an
orchard hand in Suisun Valley, had been
murdered there. Fox left Suisun in the
fall of 1889 and went to Oklahoma, where
he located a claim of 160 acres and com
menced improving it. He was known, to
have been in comfortable circumstances
financially and Invariably carried consid
erable coin on his person. ahe Incentive
for the crime was robbery, but the au
thorities have not been able to place
the guilt upon any person. _,-'__
Fox was about 50 years of age. He left
valuable personal and real property in
Oklahoma, without any heirs there or
anywhere else," as far as , the authorities
are aware. While Fox personally was
well-known in Suisun Valley he was taci
turn respecting his affairs.- The opinion
prevails, however, that he had a family
n this State.

DISCLAIM ALL
RESPONSIBILITY
Germans Say Chambers
Was at Fault.
Copyrighted, ' 1599, by the Associated Press.
BERLIN, Feb. 4.â The German Gov
ernment claims to have received .ad
vices from Samoa which dispose the
Ministers to in no wise acquiesce in the
view that the German representatives
are entirely to blame for the recent
troubles. A high foreign officer said:
"Our representations^ from Samoa
this week narrate in detail the events
preceding the bursting of the storm in
consequence of the royal election.: We
begin to see more clearly into matters.
There has been for some time past seri
ous friction . between 'I Chief Justice
Chambers and. Dr. Joannes .Raff el (the
German President of the Municipality
of Apia) and Herr Rose (the German)
THE EMPORIUM. |
Consul at Apia), arising from mutual
recriminations as to the conduct of of
ficial business and personal differences.
Mr. Chambers appears ..to have been
engaged in promoting agitation In fa
vor of the Malietoa party. If this is
confirmed we shall ask for an explana
tion, as such conduct is a direct, con
travention of the Berlin treaty, which
expressly provides that the Supreme
Judges shall not meddle with national
elections, but shall remain strictly neu
tral on such occasions. It seems, how
ever, that Mr. Chambers joined in the
intrigues â of the English . missionaries,
who feared that Protestant . interests
would suffer by the ascension of the
Roman Catholic, Mataafa. The Ger
man Government does not go to the
length of claiming that Mr. Chambers
did so act, but if the reports are con
firmed, we shall ask' for an explana
tion. Possibly, on the American side,
facts maybe adduced tending to show
that our representatives also exceeded
their proper powers. If complaints are
made they will be impartially and
amicably settled. No formal requests
or complaints have yet been made by
either . government, and there is evi
dently a desire on both sides to ( settle
the whole difficulty In a friendly way.
.Respecting the latest incident, it seems
undeniable that a German created a
disturbance, smashing windows, etc.,
but we fall -to see how Mr. Chambers
deemed it his duty to place the offender
under his jurisdiction Instead of leav
ing him to the consular jurisdiction, as
THE EMPORIUM. j
the Samoa acts prescribed. This action
on the part of Mr. Chambers will also
need an explanation. The incident,
however, is trifling. Our reports indi
cate that, generally speaking, order
now reigns at Samoa."
The correspondent of the Associated
Press spoke to the United States Em
bassador, Andrew D. White, on the
subject and he said , the above state
ment tallied with his own information.
Mr. White added that he had not re
ceived fresh instructions from Wash
ington, and he had no doubt that the
troubles would be amicably adjusted by
the three powers interested. y

When M. Rochefort boarded the steam
er, which was to take ' him across the
Mediterranean, the mob redoubled its up
roar and many people jumped Into the
boats and surrounded the vessel.
M.' Regis, the former Mayor of Algiers,
who was - suspended on account of his
bitter anti-Semite utterances, was also a

ANONYMOUS LEGISLATION.
1 /KANSAS, that prolific mother of reformers of all
[\ kinds, from Fighting John Brown to Sockless
*â  r Simpson, has another aspirant for fame, who,
curiously enough, seeks it in, the halls of legislation
by proposing a measure which will prevent. all legis
lators in future from obtaining even a mention in
an account of their work.
This gentleman, whose name is T. S. Elder, and
who holds down his seat as a fusionist, has intro
duced into the House of Representatives of his be
loved Kansas a resolution providing that all legis
lation hereafter shall be strictly anonymous. Bills
are to be introduced in such a manner that no man
shall know the name of the introducer.
The reasons which have moved Mr. Elder to pro
pose so startling an innovation are set forth by him
in a preamble to his resolution, and are so well ex
pressed therein that any attempt at digest or summary
would be a waste of words. The full text as it comes
to us reads as follows:
Whereas, The greatest enemy to legislation ls
rank partisanship, and stands more in the way of
good lawmaking than a thousand poisoned arrows,
and a member may introduce a bill of merit, one of
real worth and one which would bring sunshine and
joy to the homes of Kansas. That no sooner is a
bill read and the name of the introducer made
known than an odium attaches it â that's a "Pop" or
that's a Republican bill. So the matter goes, and
the people, who are the bone and the nerve and
sinew of the country, are beaten out of legislation
which would bless their homes all because a lot of
political, demagogues let partisanship control their
better judgment; and,
Whereas, The people are looking to the legislators
for good laws which will make their burdens lighter
and life happier, and the members of this House
Know that politics and the name of an introducer
Of a bill, though it might be all that heaven could
wish, too often defeats it; therefore, b^ it
Resolved, That the name of the introducer of a
bill be omitted from this time on and all names thus
far on bills introduced be taken off in order that we
may come at a more honest disposal of all bills
which may come before this House.
There is more horse sense in that proposition than
we usually find in the outpourings of a Kansas re
former. The language in which it is expressed is
rather sinuous and contorted, like a barbed wire fence
after a Kansas zephyr has blown through it, but for
all that it can be readily understood. The gentleman
wishes all bills to stand on their merits, and to ac
complish that he is willing to sacrifice the blooming
ambition of every legislator who delights to see his
name attached to a bill, and who usually thinks he
has achieved much for. his constituents when he can
boast that he has introduced more bills than any
other man of his weight in either House.
' Of course legislation can never be made strictly
anonymous. If. the authorship of a bill were ever in
doubt, it would be easy to raise the rascal or the
statesman by simply moving to lay the bill on the
table. He would rise at once, and the howl of him
would say plainer than print, "That is my bill."
Nevertheless, the thing is worth trying, and we trust
Kansas will do so. Anything that tends to obscure
the average legislator is commendable, and all the
more commendable if the legislator happens to be a
Kansan with a wild desire to have his name on as
many bills as there are hairs in his whiskers.
The Review of Reviews for this month, in a num
ber devoted to forwarding the aims of the expan
sionists, says of the Philippines that "Spain has
simply given us a quitclaim deed." This is exactly
what The Call said when the treaty of Paris was
signed. Having no foothold of possession, Spain at
tempted to transfer to us for twenty millions so
much of her monarchical divinity as a continental re
public could receive.
Salinas has just lost by death a woman 109. years
of age. Desiring to do what we may toward the pro
motion of longevity as well as the betterment of
morals, we add that she had been in the habit of
drinking brandy copiously, and only when asleep or
eating refrained from drawing at a foul old pipe.
Probably the report that the Cubans have been
offended by the offer of money from this country is
not based on fact. It cannot be that the Cubans have
so changed since they got their first chance at an
American free ration.
Scientists are citing the strange case of a man who
seems to be well and yet who has lost all sense of
feeling, and they seem to regard the instance as
unique. Evidently they never have heard of our
ex-Speaker Wright. ..
It was unkind of the Colorado Legislature to fire
out a lot of ministerial lobbyists, but the lobbyists,
reflecting that they had no right to be there, must not
view their experience with bitterness.
There are many people in this vicinity who would
like lo lose their grip. -
TREACHERIES OF IMPERIALISM.
THE United States is facile pridceps among na
tions. Our developed wealth surpasses the ac
cumulations of any other country. Our undevel
oped wealth, with the resources actually in sight and
upon this continent, outstrips "the dreams of avar
ice." We have a population '' approximating eighty
millions. We need a Caucasian population of five
hundred millions. The statistics of 1898 show an
extraordinary increase of commercial business,
accompanied by a vast accumulation of gold and an
unexpected stride toward financial supremacy. This
wonderful progress has been accomplished under the
Federal and State constitutions, entrenching a form of
government that exists with the full consent of the
people, and in which the fundamental rights of man
are adequately protected.
It is exactly at this period, when it might have
been least anticipated, that we are urged to ignore
our constitutional system and relapse into the im
perialism of ancient Rome or of modern Great
Britain. If our experiment had failed, this retro
grading tendency could be understood. But in the
midst of our dazzling success, its sinister import is
too apparent to be condoned. When to subserve the
base purposes of unprincipled speculators, falsely as
suming to speak for trade and for commerce, statis
tical dreams are invented and the country deluged
with lies and traitorous proposals, it is time for the
"sober second thought of the people," faithfully in
terpreted by great and incorruptible statesmen, to
place the impassable barrier of patriotism before in
cipient and audacious revolution.
We believe that this Government will be held to its
foundation, but the effort to displace it is a mere
reproduction of Roman history. When imperialism
and territorial annexation have been confronted and
argumentatively annihilated, we are told that the im
perial elements of the treaty of Paris will be coun
teracted by a declaratory resolution. What superla
tive bosh, and yet fraught with imminent danger!
We are to accept a title to the Philippines from Spain
that has no actual existence, except through the pre
tense of delegated divinity in the Spanish monarch,
for which we pay twenty millions of our good red
gold. We declare that this title conveys to us the
right of possession without the consent and against
the will. of 'the Filipinos. Having witnessed the pre
monitory symptoms of imperialism in military
strifes an/1 jealousies and in official corruption, we
propose to raise our army to one hundred thousand
men.: High officers of state have publicly referred to
our "dependencies." Aguinaldo and his troops,
wholly unfit for and incapable of American citizen
ship, nevertheless have' fought the Spanish for inde
pendence, are on their native soil, and were long ago
informed of the benevolence of our intentions. Now
they are spoken of as "banditti," and Senator Carter
of Montana objects even to any definition of our
projects because it might supply comfort "to those
who are defying the authority of the United States."
What is this but an assertion that, politically, the
Filipinos were sold to us by Spain?
But this actual definite change once wrought, this
retreat toward despotism fairly begun, our declara
tion of rights and our constitution substantially
trodden under foot, we are informed that the repub
lic will be saved by a preliminary resolution, which
reminds us of the observation of one of the candidates
at Sacramento of an . opposing lawyer, that he
"prayed, but did not mean it." Bah! It has been
repeated a hundred times that our forefathers pledged
their "lives, their fortunes and their sacred honors"
against a preamble. They courted death for an idea.
We are asked to sacrifice a republic for trade. ' '-,'â 
It is time for the mass of our citizens to be heard
and to press with irresistible force against the revo
lutionists at Washington. They have our constitu
tion, our history, our traditions, our practice, the
buried ages of sacrificed humanity, to inspire them.
They have great Senators and powerful orators and
debaters in both houses of Congress to interpret
their wishes. They have the present and the future
to hold them to American responsibility. Let slave
trading speculation,' aspiring militarism and aggres
sive covetousness die that this continental and united
republic may live. w ' .
The gentleman at the head of the Christian Endea
vor Society says that according to the golden rule
this country must hold the Philippines. Just how he
figures this out is not clear. Perhaps somebody has
induced him to accept a bogus golden rule, inasmuch
as nobody would try the gold brick game on one of
hi*.- cloth. If we treat the Filipinos as we would be
treated we have only the course of taking hands off
and letting them have the liberty they have fought to
attain. If they yearned for an American yoke to
replace the Spanish the case would be different, but
as yet they have displayed no symptom of yearning.
Assemblyman Jilson in the act of raiding the cor
ner grocery affords a pleasing and surprising spec
tacle, since he is not "rushing the can," but appears
bent. on moral reform. This sort of reform would be
an excellent thing if Jilson would get in the way of it.
But there is difficulty in imagining him the author of
it. He does not look like a reformer, and while lift
was spending Grant's $400 did not pose as one.
THE SEAWALL BILL.
ALL citizens who have an intelligent idea of the
needs of San Francisco in relation to the
rapidly expanding trade' of the Pacific will
find cause for gratification in the passage by the Sen
ate of the bill introduced by Senator Braunhart pro
viding for an issue of State bonds to create a fund for
the extension of the seawall.
Great as are the advantages of our spacious har
bor, they are not sufficient for the requirements of
the immense commerce of the port. We must have
many improvements made for increasing the facilities
of docking and loading and unloading the largest
ocean ships. Our trade has already outgrown the
docking facilities and the warehouse accommodations
of the water front. It is imperative that we should
begin an extensive system of improvements of all
kinds if we hope to hold our position as the
metropolis of Pacific Ocean commerce. . j
The improvement and extension of the seawall will
be a benefit of wide-reaching importance. It will
affect the city in many ways and materially advance
its welfare. With the construction and improvement
of the wall southward, where there is ample security
for shipping, free from the disturbing movements of
swift-running tides, there will come an increase in
the area available for commercial houses and large
manufacturing establishments, . the nature of whose
business renders proximity to the water front a mat
ter of great economic importance.
As was pointed out in the debate on the Braunhart
bill, the proposed bond issue will not entail the cost
of one dollar upon the taxpayers of the interior. It
would have been better had the whole State borne
the expense, so that the port could be relieved from
the heavy charges, imposed upon shipping. . Such re
lief would be to the interest of all, since it is through
this port the State receives the great bulk of its
foreign goods. Under existing conditions, however,
that is too much to expect, and the advocates of the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 5. 1899.
measure have acted expediently in making the port
improvement a charge' upon the port itself.
It is within the limits of possibility that with the
increase of facilities for shipping which will be given
by the improvements of the port there may come such
a lessened burden in the cost of loading and unload
ing as will counterbalance the port charges required
to pay for them. At any rate, the improvement of
the seawall will benefit the city in so many ways there
will be but little, if any, objection to the means which
have been provide^ for defraying the cost.
THE SPEED OF STREET CARS.
AMONG the bills before the Legislature which
have the merit of common sense and are well
calculated to promote the public welfare is
one conferring upon municipalities the power of
regulating for themselves the rate of speed of street
cars. The object of the measure is to enable the
municipal authorities to make such regulations on
the subject as will conform to the needs of different
localities, instead of having, as at present, one in
variable rule for all.
The need for a change in the law has arisen from
the change that has been effected in street car lines
themselves. When street railways were first intro
duced they rarely extended beyond the more thickly
settled portions of the city in which they were laid.
Consequently a law fixing a uniform rate of speed for
all was at that time fairly just and expedient.
Gradually, however, some of the lines extended
farther and farther into the suburbs, until now there
are lines running for miles through comparatively
unsettled districts. It is folly to require that these
suburban extensions shall be conducted on the same
terms and conditions as the lines downtown.
A rate of speed of eight miles an hour is sufficient
in the center of a city, where people have to traverse
but a short distance, and where the thoroughfares
are so crowded as to make it dangerous for a higher
rate of' speed to be used. In the outside districts,
however, where the distance to be covered by the
passenger is one of miles, speed is an important mat
ter, and, as the danger of accidents is slight owing to
the comparatively little traffic along the road, it is
desirable that a much higher rate should be permitted.
â¢If a speed of eight miles an hour is expedient
within the thickly settled portion of the city, it would
not be too much to permit a speed of twelve miles
in the suburbs. It is clearly absurd to require a car
running in the district around Ingleside, for instance;
to move as slowly as one along the lower part of
Market street. . "* 7
The question of speed in any locality is simply one
of expediency, and should be determined by the needs
of the particular case and not by general law. One
might as well require a railway train to run as slowly
through the rural districts as it does in the city as to
make a similar requirement of the modern street rail
way.
As a matter of fact, the street railways of American
cities are every year pushing farther and farther into
the country,- and as they extend a greater amount of
speed is needed to render them. thoroughly service
able to the people. That speed should be regulated
by local authorities, who know the conditions of the
different sections of the route* traversed by each road
and can therefore determine what rate of speed is
best fitted to meet the demands of the traffic without
endangering life or property. The bill granting that
authority to municipalities is in every respect a good
one and ought to find general support in both houses.
AN object lesson in legislation is furnished by
the cases of Henry Walker and Francis Dunn,
two young men who were held for trial in one
of the Police Courts a few days ago on a charge of
burglary. Walker is 19 and Dunn 21 years of age.
They were charged with breaking into a room in a
Market-street lodging-house and stealing a coat and
vest, which they sold to a pawnbroker for $3. The
police officer who arrested them traced them from the
scene of their burglary to a poolroom on Stevenson
street, where,. with the proceeds of their crime, they
were endeavoring to win on the horse races.
When brought before the Police Court the boys at
tempted no defense, but resigned themselves calmly
to a term in the State prison. They said they had
lost all their money "playing the races," and that they
had stolen the coat and vest for the purpose of pro
curing funds with which to continue the practice.
There are two or three bills before the Legislature
which provide for suppressing these poolrooms. They
are being antagonized by a numerous lobby, and
efforts will undoubtedly be made to smother them in
committee, or if their authors succeed in getting them
before' the House to kill them upon the floor. We
do not see how any conscientious, self-respecting
man who has been elected to represent a constituency
in the Legislature, however, can contribute his in
fluence to the defeat of any measure which will put
an end to such stories as will ultimately have to be
. told of Henry Walker and Francis Dunn.
The poolroom lobby at Sacramento may raise a
"sack" arid influence a few degraded legislators to en
compass the defeat of this legislation. But if there is
a man in either House who would yield to influence
exerted in such a cause, neither his arguments nor his
interests should receive the attention of his self
respecting colleagues. There ought to be a moral
'sense in every community sufficiently strong to sup
press dens such as are here under discussion. Both
these young men were willing to .work for a living
until they fell within the baleful influence of a bucket
shop poolroom. Their lives are now ruined, since
they are bound to serve a term in the penitentiary.
We sincerely trust that this Legislature will not ad
journ without passing a law so stringent that under
it the police of this city will be able to close up every
one of these dens forever. ,
One Stallard has just been sent up for three
months, his crime having been an attempt to kill his
wife, evidenced by the fact that he shot her twice.
There have been juries who would have regarded
Stallard's act as reprehensible. â  So far as justice is
concerned, he might as well have been given three
niinutes as three months, for such a finding was a
farce.
y There should be in law a new distinction between
the hard-working man out of a job and the idle
vagrant. Such distinction as there is at present is all
in favor of the vagrant. â¢ â ' ' ' V. .

"H. J. A.": These may be the wrong
Initials, for your chirography is nearly
as bad as your morals. Nobody but a
blackguard sends an abusive letter to

the qualification "With Entire Frank

therefore excuse me for not devoting
space to you. There are respectable
rogues who need attention.
There can be no objection to sub
mitting to the people the proposed
amendment to the constitution exempt
ing church property ' from taxation.
There could be no valid objection to
submitting to them an amendment for
the burning of politicians at the stake
or the boiling in oil of cartoonists.
None of these amendments would be
acceptable, and one would be about as
acceptable as another. hen a church
is not willing to pay taxes it would bet
ter dispose of | its realty and do its
worshiping under the shade of a tree.
A church may be useful to the com
munity, but so are street cars and gas
works, this fact being no reason why
they should escape a share of the com
mon burden. To whimper over taxes
is small business for a church. As a
rule â¢ ministers are poorly paid and
even their meager salaries are grudg
ingly advanced. People want bargain
rates on salvation. Many churches are
wealthy, and many have individual
members who could pay all the taxes,
the salary of the preacher and the run
ning expenses of the concern with less
hardship than is entailed upon an or
dinary citizen in yielding up a street
car falre. Of course, some of them have
no more piety than there is poetry in
the emotions of a cow, but their bluff
would work better if they did not groan
every time they reach into their pock
ets. They evade taxes enough when
they hide their riches from the Asses
sor, and they should not be permitted
by statute to evade more. The churches
have police and fire protection. In
many places they are guarded against
the encroachments of the saloon. Let
them pay for this protection, partly be
cause they are able, but more because
to do so is just and right. .*â¢
Whatever may be the wisdom of en
larging the army such nonsense as Con
gressman Maguire projected into his
argument against it does not appeal to
any but the Maguine judgment. Ac
cording to this statesman the change
is in token of a desire on the part of
the Federal government to subdue and
terrorize the government of the several
States, which is so manifest an ab
surdity as to create no excuse for de
voting time to refuting it. It may be
designated as tommy-rot or any old
rot.

been that part of them were stupid and
the rest stolen, and there was no
method of ascertaining by inspection
what any of them were for.
The community must be getting tired
of the silly and venomous war on
Shatter. The man is to be judged by
results rather than by the remarks of
a disgruntled . journalist whose repre
sentatives were bounced from. Cuba by
Shafter's orders, they having been
there for the purpose of making mis
chief and nickels. The fact is plain
that Shatter led an army which
achieved a remarkable victory, against
odds, and did it quickly, with compara
tively trifling loss of life. Against this
record the I oreheads may rail as long
as they find enjoyment in it, and each
new attack will but emphasize the ac
knowledged truth that they are a lot

The gentleman at the head of the
Christian Endeavor Society, a very
worthy gentleman, whose purposes are
presumably lofty, says that the Golden
Rule constrains this country to keep
the Philippines. The Golden Rule is a
sublime guide to human action, the
most benign and the perfect rule. It is
not lived up to much. If it were earth
would be a paradise and earth is not a
paradise. Yet I cannot see the force of
the ' reverend enthusiast's" reasoning.
The natives of the Philippines y have
long been fighting for liberty as our
own forefathers did. We go there and
say to them: "You don't want liberty.
What you want is the privilege of
wearing a new yoke in place of the
Spanish yoke of which we have so gen
erously relieved you." Then we proceed
to fashion the new yoke and persuade
the Filipinos that their fresh burden is
light. If there is any essence of the
Golden Rule about this I fail to see it.'
It seems to me to be.hoggishness and
nothing j less. If the Filipinos can be
made to think that American rule
would be preferable to Spanish, as in
dubitably it would, all right, but let us
not be hypocrites about it nor try to
justify by Holy Writ a course which
has its rise and progress in selfishness.
That there would be profit in holding
the Philippines I do not doubt, but so
there is profit in holding up a stage. â¢ I
do not believe that which must be done
at the point of the bayonet toward
subduing an v inoffensive people gains
color of propriety by any Golden Rule
palaver. If we , keep the islands let us
be honest enough to confess that we do
so because we have the chance and are
sufficiently strong, but let us riot slaver
the operation with a bogus sanctimony.

I Mission and Sixteenth Sts. i
0000 0000 60060 060 00 poo 000
teresting street this city does not af- j
ford. The buildings which line it are
not imposing. They represent for the
most part the back elevation of struct
ures which put up imposing fronts on
Market or Mission, and are somewhat
careless as* to the rear view. From my
window I see tailors at work, book
keepers making long rows of figures,
and in going in either direction am
obliged to pass a number of saloons
and poolrooms. There is a sausage fac
tory, too, which salutes the olfactory
senses with a suggestion of things long
dead and partly cooked. There are
tumble-down rookeries in which people
live because they have not the enter
prise to die, and tow-headed urchins
who thrive on dirt. But all these are
mere incidents. ] The street itself is the
study.' There are sidewalks on either
side, but few venture to tread them be
cause they are devoted to the storage
of goods. Not long ago a boy, led by
the rashness of youth to walk on the
walk, had a case of goods fall on him,
whereupon he died, as might have been
expected. Presumption of this sort does
not go in Stevenson street. The pru
dent take to the middle of the road,
but there they find that a pit has been
digged for them.. It is a peculiar road.
It has a cobble surface, subject to sud
den and violent changes that is, when
it-has a surface. - Ordinarily the bow
els are being torn out of it, and sur
face is one of the things it lacks. One
day there will be necessity for secret
ing a pipe of some sort in its depths,
and the next day a new set of men
spy out and disinter the * lpe with all
the air of having made a great discov
ery. After each convulsion the cob
bles are replaced with care. They are
noble cobbles, each one standing put
like the sore thumb of the lamented
Nye. I do not see why they are ever
put back, for as sure as they are, they
are yanked out again. They simply
serve to make the passing beer wagon
more vociferous, and having done this
are straightway disturbed by the picks
of a fresh lot of vandals. There, have
been some buildings erected at the
Third street corner, and the brick and
lumber from these has taken all but
the space necessary for a strictly sober
man to use in threading his way. In
dry weather the dust is a foot deep, in
wet weather the mud is two feet deep.
The saloon-keepers tell me confidential
ly that their business is being ruined,
and even the tramps wont to thrive on
the odor of sausage are getting discour
aged almost to the point of hunting a
job. Altogether Stevenson street is a
joy and an inspiration. : Those who in
vade it, and get .as far as The Call
brainery, may think they hear the
whirr of dynamos, but no. That sound
is the editorial organ of thought athrob,
and it is aided and abetted in volume
by the charm of environment. Steven
son street is a daisy. There is not an
other like it in the whole municipal
garden. v '

I regret that the lady who sends an

and also sends the poetry, does not
seem to have made a hit with the busi

help her, but my influence there is
meager, and even on the editorial end
of the' paper it is insufficient to get the
poetry published. The truth is that a
lot of crushed geniuses are about every

petty larceny and battery and will be
sentenced to-morrow. He stole a case of
whisky from the saloon of Gus H. Monk,

Bathos a Big Surprise.
Briar Sweet, not bred in old Kentucky,
but in sunny California, commenced her
1599 season at Oakland track yesterday.
The majestic daughter of Imp. Sir
Modred was one of five starters for the
Paciflc Union stake, at one mile and a
furlong. The conditions of the stake al
lowed her In at 94 pounds. "Skeets"
Martin had the leg up, riding five pounds
overweight, and the most liberal of the
members of the ring laid 2 to 9 against
her around post time. Trainer Walter
Jennings had the queen of the turf ready
the flrst time of asking. Quickly taken
to the front by Martin, she stepped off the
mile in 1:40 flat, and with one slight
bobble finished out the distance in 1:52%.

less than a length. Storm King, too, was '
right there, being a close third. At one '
time, when about a furlong from home,
the winner seemed to falter, the big crowd
thought she was beaten. This it seems is
one of her notions, for when Martin
shook her up she answered his call and
forged ahead.
The racing was marked by nothing
not-worthy, unless it was Fred Foster's .
expensive win with Dr. Sheppard. The j
astute Eastern turfman entered his big
thoroughbred in the second event, a sell- j
ing affair, to be sold for $700, which he
won in a gallop. Coda finished second,
and her owner, J. Nagle Burke, bid the
winner up to $1500. Mr. Foster retained
his horse. The favorites more than held
their own, capturing four of the six races
decided.
The opening sprint, over the Futurity !
course, resulted ln an upset. Frank Van
Ness' three-year-old Llmewater was
made the medium of a big plunge, but in
a hard drive was downed less than a
length by Guilder. The latter, with Nash
Turner up, had his odds swiped from 6 to
1 to 14 to 5.
For the mile and a sixteenth run that '
followed, Dr. Sheppard ruled an odds-on ;
favorite, and won in a gallop. Coda, well
ridden by W. H. Martin, led the wretched
ly ridden Morinel out for the place. Bull
man's exhibition on the latter could have
been Improved on by a longshoreman.
From start to finish the four furlong
skit for two-year-olds was replete with
rough riding, Bullman more than holding
his own. He sat astride Bathos, a 20 to t
1 shot, and reached home two lengths j
ahead of Lomond, the favorite. Mort- !
gage, the good thing, with Spencer up,
proved a slow beginner, eventually man- j
aging to get the show.
Foster's gimlet-legged sprinter. Abuse,!
made a spectacle of his field in the fifth I
event at six furlongs. A prohibitive I
choice, he won with Cash Sloan wearing
a broad grin on his face. Peixotto, a i
good repeater, came back, downing Mid- i
light for the place.
The last event of the day was a free |
handicap, decided over the Futurity
course. Satsuma, with Eddie Jones up.
had command in the betting, and after
being knocked out of the running In the
early stages, won in stake horse fashion.
Good Hope secured the place, leading
Shasta Water out a couple of lengths.
Track Notes.
The stewards of the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club met last evening at the Pal
ace Hotel, and at this late day, after
the public's money has been lost, the last
big steal at Ingleside termed a steeple
chase was given a thorough overhauling. It
happened on January 21. and the Haw
thorne outfit had Its toes roasted. They
were down on Colonel Bartlett and Sil
verado won. Therefore a few Native Sons
had to get it. Bert Shepard, who rodo
Huntsman, was ruled off. W. Shields,
the owner of Lord Chesterfield, was also
ruled off. J. Coyle, considered the Inter
locutor in the game, had the same sen
tence read to him. JOC might shape
around and be hard to beat, so it was or
dered that this Jumper and Jockey Hig
gins be indefinitely shelved. The cunning
displayed by the board of stewards sur
passes the bounds of comprehension. If
they were looking fÂ«r the bookmaker that
handled Jockey Burns and possibly one
or two more and could not see him they
sould visit an oculist.
ON THE TENNIS COURT.
It was intended to hold a ladles' tour
nament, doubles, at the California Lawn
Tennis Club on Wednesday, beginning at
10 o'clock ln the morning, but at that
hour the courts were too wet to play
upon, so the tournament was deferred
until Thursday. The weather on that
day again proving unfavorable, the tour
natwtfnt was postponed until Wednesday
February 8. To-day a round robin tour
nament will be held. Some keenly con
tested games were played on Thursday
afternoon. George F. Whitney beat Ray
Cornell two sets, the score, being 6 â 3 and
6âo. George F. Whitney beat Grant
Smith two sets, the score being 6â and
6âo. Barclay Henley beat Frank Long
one set, the score being 6âo, and Frank

In the first regatta of the Oakland navy,
held last Sunday, there were eight en

at nine holes for a special prize, each
player keeping his handicap.
This afternoon on the links of the Oak
land Golf Club the third competition for
the Tibbetts cup will take place. This cup

THE SCHUETZEN BUND.
Local Members Waiting for a Report
of Old Board of Officers.
The officers of the National Schuetzen
Bund, recently formed in this city for the
big tournament in 1901, are all at sea.
The rules of the organization are that ev
ery member-club should be informed of
the financial condition of the bund within
thirty days after every tournament, but
it has been over six months since the
shooting festival in Glendale, N. V., and
no statement has been made and none of
the records and archives of the national
organization have been sent to the new
bund in this city by the members of the
old, as required by the bund laws. From
all accounts the oncers of the old organ
ization had a considerable sum of money
on hand, left over from the preceding
shoot and taken in at the last tournament.
From fragments of gossip among the
riflemen of the East it is believed that the
sum was from $12,000 to $16,000, yet Mr.
Weber, president of the old bund, in
Sports, of New York, of which he ls the
editor, congratulates the bund that it did
not come out in debt; for all that all
of the funds were not consumed, and
the bund was not obliged to make a draw
on the $200,000 guarantee fund. Riflemen
out here are at a loss to know what
this means. The new president, Richard
Finking, says that if the accounts, rec
ords and archives are not sent here by
the end of next week he will call a meet
ing to have the bund decide what to do.
He acknowledges that without the records
the bund cannot do anything.
â¢ C. W. Swain, secretary of the lone Rifle
Club of Amador County, has furnished
an account of some rifle shooting by mem
bers of that club that compares favorably
with the efforts of the riflemen around
the liny, who are shooting whenever the
occasion permits. At the club's regular
contests last Sunday tho shooting was
done at 200 yards, off hand, on the Colum
bia target, the scores being runs of ten
shots to the string. John Fink made 64,
74 and 75. Dr. B. H. Foreman's best was
39. 56 and 57. The 39 score stands as the
high record of the lone Club, and the
shots were 2, 1, 2. 3, 4, 5, 4, 6, 5, 6-59. This
was the last of his string and was made
when all of the other marksmen had fin
ished for the day. When the marker
came up from the pit he explained
that the last ten shots might have
been better by three or. four points, but
on account of the center being covered
with pasters there was some doubt and
he counted out instead of in. If the
center had been clean it is possible that
the scores would have shown as good as
36 or 37, but only the 39 was claimed. Out
of 72 shots that Dr. Foreman fired during
the matches he only got out of the 12-inch
black twice. M. J. WHITE.
STEELHEAD PISHING.
Anglers Are Waiting Another Heavy
Rain at Point Reyes.
The anglers are not meeting with much
success, as the water in the lagoons Is
too low and clear, conditions which are
not favorable to sport. A good rain is
needed to flood the creeks, when the an
nual February run of steelheads will be
welcomed. During the last storm the
fishes made a mad rush for the head
waters of the rivers and creeks, where
they soon became the property of the
country lads, who are handy with a fish
spear. The killing of one female fish
means a loss of 5000 fry to the stream
whence the fish is taken. Anglers who
spend thousands of dollars yearly among
the hotels and the stables of country
towns which are within easy reach of
fishing streams aro not very liable to
return if they find that there are no
trout to be caught. To slaughter breed
ing fishes is the surest way of destroying
a good trout stream.
The following poetic effusion from a lo
cal bard, entitled "The Steelhead," will
be read with much interest by the an
glers, who visit Point Reyes:
A plump and gamey fish are we
When first we come In from the sea.
And rest a while in tidal waters
Ere we ascend to breeding quarters.
While waiting here to go up stream
The banks with different anglers teem.
There's â¢'Honest John," with big chunks of roe
Who causes us a deal of woe;
"Snake-'em-out" Frank, with his shirt of
leather,
Who's after us in all sorts of weather;
The truth to tell, which he can't do.
He captures of us quite a few.
And Michael, the scribe, skillful with rod as
with pen.
Takes many of us home to his little den.
Charlie's Kate and Precht. sling spoons with
zest,
And at that game are two of the best.
The spoqp fools us from morning till night,
And we, poor souls, can't help but to bite.
Then Otto, with Dickie boy and sugar-cured
roe, â¢ â '", .';â  :
Quite often proves our mortal foe.
Sweet-voiced Ben, with millions of flies.
Our patience very sorely tries. - â¢
Doc W.. with his shiney pate.
Who fishes with science and scorns to use bait.
There's "June Bug," too, with his "mall"
friend,
Al, Louis and others without end.
All in all our rest proves not of the best.
At last there comes a welcome rain
And soon we head up stream again;
We travel miles above North Bend
And still our troubles do nut end;
The fish laws now should us protect.
But these. In the country, have no effect.
When the poacher wants fish to eat or sell
He says game laws can go to ;
And then with ruthless tread
He walks all over our spawning-bed:
At night with lantern and wicked leer
He captures us with his cruel spear.
We have no rest by day or night
And soon are in a sorry plight:
We look as though we'd been on the rack,
And now they call us the "Razor-Back."
Our fins and tails are worn to a shred.
Oh, that we were back in old ocean's bedl
At last our labors come to an end
And tall foremost we the stream descend:
A few of us only reach the "White House" so
dear,
And from there to the ocean they say is quite
clear.
We are safe again home.
Though a hard chase we've been led.
And there ends the song of the Point Reyes
steelhead.
Baseball at Recreation Park.
The Alta and the Golden Gate baseball
teams will meet at Recreation Park,

KENNEL AND BENCH.
Sale of the English Setter Val's Mark
to a Los Angeles Sportsman.
The most notable sale of the season has
just been consummated, and it is the cele
brated English setter dog Val's Mark that
has been thereby transferred from the
ownership of "Bob" Gardiner to that of
John Schumacher of Los Angeles. The
consideration was $175, and all the love
and affection that such a brilliant per
former as Mark is bound to evolve from
his new owner. Val's Mark has literally
made his mark, and a brilliant one at
that, on the field trial ground, and has
justified his claim to be the worthy off
spring of royal parents. He is by Vali
ente, out of Peach Mark, and no better
parentage can be claimed. Mr. Schu
macher is to be congratulated on having
proved a successful bargain hunter.
Mastiffs are decldely on the up grade.
All the pups bred by the Montez kennels,
out of Lola (40,560), sired by Chino Don
(37,547), have been sold, and they will
without exception figure in the ring at the
May show. Henry Spaulding has bought
Charles Rex, by Sir Harcourt, out of
Lady Glendora, from H. S. Brown, and
will also exhibit his new acquisition. He
expects to win money, medals, ribbons
and glory.
The St. Bernard men declare that, pro
vided the judge selected by the bench
show committee be agreeable to them, the
show of the "holy breed" will break all
records. All differences heretofore exist
ing between the St. Bernard Club and the
San Francisco Kennel Club have been
satisfactorily and completely adjusted,
and sweet harmony reigns supreme.
The bench show committee has started
in vigorously to work on preliminary de
tails, and things are working more
smoothly than ever before.
A meeting of the American. Kennel Club
Pacific Coast special committee will be
held during the coming week.
IMPORTING PHEASANTS.
The English Ring-Neck Variety to
Be Brought From New Jersey.
The State Board of Fish and Game
Commissioners met yesterday and con
sidered a proposition made by the Fresno
County Sportsmen's Association. The
secretary of the organization wrote that
the members are very much Interested
in the propagation of all kinds of game
birds in that county and are desirous of
Increasing within Its borders the game
fowls of other lands. The State has
placed many Mongolian pheasants In the
county, which the sportsmen are guard
ing with jealousy. Now the members
wish to add the English ring-necked
pheasant, which has proved to be such a
success in New Jersey. The offer was
that the association would bring out
twenty-five or thirty of these birds if the
commission would stand one-half of the
expense. The Commissioners considered
that the proposition was a good one, as
they had desired to bring these birds into
the State, hut the limited fund at the
disposal of the commission and the gnat
expense lt is being put to in importing the
Mongolian pheasant from the Orient
would not permit. The steamer Coptic,
which arrived Thursday, brought an
other lot of Mongolian pheasants from
Shanghai, China. They came from the
commission's agent, F. H. Haskell, who
Is now In China selecting pheasants for
the hills and valleys of California. The
new arrivals are in good condition and
will at once bo liberated in the hills near
lone, Amador County, and near York
vllle, Mendocino County, one-half to each
section.

SENATORS SPAR
FOR TIME ON THE
TREATY OF PEACE
Failure of Efforts to Secure
Consent to a Vote on the In=
terpretation Resolutions.
Call Office, Rlggs House, Washington, Feb. 4.
X tie of the actual canvasses of the Senate showed to-day a sufficient
number of votes to ratify the peace treaty. The canvass of friends of
the treaty showed from one to three votes short of the necessary two
thirds. The canvass of the opposition showed thirty-three votes . posi
tively pledged against the treaty, and which are relied cm by the opposi
tion managers as absolutely to be trusted, and four more that have been
recorded in opposition, but in which there is not the same confidence.
The most now claimed for the treaty on an actual canvass, however,
is fifty-nine votes, and this is reduced by the more careful to fifty
seven. This is by actual canvass, and does not take into account the
"floating" vote, which the friends of the treaty count on.
The managers of the opposition declare that the following Senators
will vote against the treaty, it being impossible to shake them in their
determination to do so: Bacon, Hate, Berry, Caffery, Chilton, Cockrell,
Danlell, Gorman, Hale, Seitfeld, Hoar, Jones of Arkansas, Jones of Ne
vada, Kenney, McEnery, McLaurin, Mallory, Martin, Mills, Mitchell,
Money, Murphy, Pasco, Pettigrew, Rawlins, Roach, Smith, Tillman, Tur
ley, Turner, Turpie, Vest and Whiteâ 33.
Only fifty-seven votes for the treaty are claimed as sure by the lead
ers on that side, and five are said to be doubtful, out of which the
friends of the treaty expect to get the necessary three that are re
quiredâsixty being the number necessary for a two-thirds majority.
Under the agreement entered into a vote on the treaty will be taken
ln the Senate on Monday, the understanding being that the discussion
will end at 3 o'clock that afternoon. Amendments will doubtless be
offered, but .the majority will not accept any of them. Should the treaty
fail no further effort will be made this session to put it through, and
the President in such an event would be compelled to call an extra sea
sion of the Senate.
WASHINGTON, Feb. Another ef
fort was made In the executive session
of the Senate to secure unanimous con
sent to a vote on the resolutions inter
pretative of the peace treaty and it was
refused by the opponents of the treaty.
The request was proffered by Senator
Sullivan of Mississippi, who expressed
a desire to have a vote on the resolu
tion offered by himself. Senator Jones
made the objection.
There was also an effort to secure
general consent to an earlier meeting
Monday, but this also was refused.
Senator Jones of Arkansas acting as
spokesman for the opposition.
Senator Lodge was in charge of the
fortunes of the treaty to-day in the ab
sence of Senator Davis. He suggested
meeting Monday at 11 o'clock, but con
sent was refused, as was also consent
to a recess until 12 o'clock Monday or
to an order dispensing with the routine
business on that day. The result was
an adjournment until 12 o'clock Monday
without any conditions.
The fact developed during this fenc
ing for time that several Senators
wished still to be heard in explanation
of their attitudes. Among those who
have announced their intention to ask
to be heard is Senator Allen of Nebras
ka, who it was stated, would denounce
the opposition to the treaty in the
Democratic ranks as a conspiracy
against Mr. Bryan.
For the rest of the session Senator
Morgan occupied the attention of the
Senate in a very forcible argument in
support of the treaty. He declared his
conviction that the treaty should be
ratified without amendment or modify
ing declaration. He believed the Amer
ican commissioners to the Paris con
ference had acted very wisely and in
the best interests of the whole country
and he, for one, was willing to accept
their word just as they had given it to
us. He was also perfectly willing to
trust the President, he added, as he
would be Congress, to take care of the
Philippine question in a way most sat
isfactory to our own people and in the
best interests of the Filipinos. He
warned the Democratic Senators
against taking a position against the
treaty, asserting that if they succeeded
In defeating it they would wreck the
Democrat!! party. Senator Morgan
contended that there were no consti
tutional Impediments ln the way of ac
quiring the Philippines. They could be
acquired under international law and
the constitution gave full scope to the
legislation giving effect to law for the
control of international affairs.
NEWS OF THE MARE
ISLAND NAVY YARD
Commodore Watson Orders Tempo-
rary Suspension of Work on.
the Banger.
VALLEJO, Feb. 4.â Acting under tele
graphic instructions from the Secretary
of the Navy, Commodore Watson to-day
ordered the suspension of work on the
Ranger. This will cause a delay in com
pleting the vessel, as the department has
decided not to use her for the proposed
work of making soundings for a cable
between Honolulu and Manila, via Guam.
Commander Charles Belknap, who had
been ordered to command the Ranger,
recommended that the collier Nero be
used for the purpose. His recommenda-
tion was approved, and the work of fit
ting up the Nero will be proceeded with
without delay. She will be docked to
morrow morning and will be overhauled
and fitted with apparatus for making deep
sea soundings. Her immense coal capa
city will make her more available for the
work than the Ranger, as she can remain
at sea for months at a time, while the
limited steam radius of the Ranger would
cause delays and other trouble in making
soundings.
The cessation in work on the Ranger
will be but temporary, as she will prove
a valuable vessel for cruising purposes.
The riggers have her standing rigging up,
and the other departments have all their
work well in hand.
The McCulloch was moved down to the
quaywall yesterday afternoon and moored
under the shears. She was to have gone
Into dock next week, but the urgency
orders for fitting out the Nero prevented
it. The famous revenue cutter will be in
dock several weeks, and will be put into
thorough trim In every respect. There
will be about $20,000 spent on the McCul
loch. Her crew is still living on the
Thetis.
The revenue cutter Bear has been lying
beside the Thetis and McCulloch for sev
eral days. She was shifted to the quay
wall. The vessel ls In need of extensive
repairs, but no definite estimate can be
given until she is placed in dock. It was
the Intention of the officials to dock her
on Monday in conjunction with the tor
pedo boat Davis, but the Idea was aban
doned upon receipt of orders concerning
the Nero.
Commodore Watson has sent orders to
the collier Justin to come up to Mare
Island on the first tide, and the vessel
will arrive to-morrow. The Celtic, which
had been moored to the midstream buoy,
was moved alongside the quaywall, oppo
site the steam engineering department, to
make room for the collier. The Celtic is
a very large vessel and is in very good
condition. There is no evidence of her
having encountered stormy weather, at*
her paint looks as fresh as though just
put on.
New Battleship Maine.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 4.â The keel of
the new battleship Maine will be laid at
the Cramps shipyard on February 15. This
date will be the anniversary of the ex
plosion In Havana harbor of the ship of
that name. The Cramps also announce
that efforts will be pushed to have the
new battle-ship ready to be launched on
February 15, 1!W). the second anniversary
of the Maine disaster.
WASHINGTON, Feb. This was
another day for expansion oratory in
the Senate. In the open session the
speakers were Chilton of Texas and
Woleott of Colorado. Chilton made a
constitutional argument in support of
the Vest resolution, his principal ob
jection to the annexation of the Philip
pines being that it would admit to this
country both the Filipinos and their :
products to come in competition with
our own workingmen and their pro- !
ducts. His proposed solution of the
pending problem was the establishment
of a republic in the Philippines over I
which the United States would exercise I
such care as it gives the Republic of
Liberia. Woleott made an eloquent â
almost impassionedâ appeal to the Sen
ate for the ratification of the peace
treaty.
At the beginning of the session Allen
of Nebraska offered the following resolu
tion:
_ Resolved. That the Senate of the United
States, in ratifying and confirming the treaty
of Paris, does not commit Itself or the Govern
ment to the doctrines that th- Islands acquired
by virtue of the war with Spain are to be an
nex-,] or to become a part of the United
States, mil that the difference In the language
of said treaty as respects the Island of Cuba
and its inhabitants and the Islands of Porto
Rico and the Philippine Islands and their In
habitants shall not be construed or be held to
be a difference in effect, but that it is the in
tention of and the purpose of the Senate in
ratifying said treaty to place the inhabitants
or the Philippine Islands and Porto Rico in
exactly the same position as respects their rela
tions to the United States as are the inhabit
ants of Cuoa.
Allen gave notice that he would address
the Senate on the resolution on Monday.
Chilton of Texas then addressed the
Senate on the various anti-expansion res
olutions. He asserted that he was not an
anti-expansionist or an anti-annexation
ist. Within its proper bounds he regarded
It as the duty of this country to widen its
influence. He believed the acquisition of
Porto Rico and the island of Guam was
well, but in the acquisition of the Phil
ippines a grave public policy was Involv
ed. He believed such acquisition involved
serious perils and that dangers to our
Government and institutions would con
stantly arise. He did not regard the an
nexation of the Philippines as at all simi
lar to that of Louisiana and California
and other territory now a part of the
United States. His belief was that if we
took the Philippines and they became a
part of this country, our people would
never cease to regret it.
Chilton said that if our operations were
confined to Porto Rico and Cuba we would
need no increase in the standing army,
but if the Philippines were taken we
should require an army of 200,000 men to
subjugate the scattered and turbulent
elements in the islands, and pensions
would be plied on pensions. He declared
his belief that the Supreme Court would
hold that Congress had no power to pre
vent the Filipinos from passing from one
part of the country to another, but even
if the inhabitants were shut out, their
products would not be and could not be.
Woleott said the ratification of the
treaty was a patriotic duty. He added
that the opposition to the treaty was in
tended for political advantage in the next
Presidential election. He said there were
a few men In the chamber with patriot
ism enough to obliterate party lines and
ratify the treaty. He said there was not
a country in Europe that was not hostile
to us with the exception of England. He
paid a tribute to that country and her
friendship to the United States. He also
paid a high tribute to the President, say
ing be had ably guided the Government
through perilous times. If we abandoned
the Philippines, continued Woleott, we
would leave the people of the islands to
the greedy nations of Europe.

"NO POPERY" IS
AGAIN THE CRY
Ritual Question Waged
in England.
PEOPLE ARE WROUGHT UP
MOMENTUM (xIVEN THE MOVE
MENT STARTED BY KENSIT.
Balfour Howled Down at Manchester
for Refusing to Discuss Mat
ters of Church and
â¢ State.
Copyrighted, 1809, by the Associated Press.
LONDON, Feb. 4.â British politics, on
the eve of the reassembling of Parlia
ment, shows that the old war cry of "no
Popery," so long silent, has suddenly
usurped first place. It is overriding party
programmes and forcing leaders who pre
fer to divorce the church from parlia
mentary strife to declare themselves. The
movement was started last summer by a
then unknown bookseller named John
Kenslt, whom Englishmen rated as
Americans did Coxey. It gathered mo
mentum through the low churchists' agi
tation, until it now dominates public at
tention. The newspapers are swamped
with communications, mass meetings are
being organized everywhere, and the
voters are insisting that their repre
sentatives announce their views.
How fiercely the people are wrought up
was hardly realized until A. J. Balfour
(the Government leader in the House of
Commons and First Lord of the Treas
ury), perhaps personally the most popu
lar publicist, addressing his constituents
at Manchester on Monday last, endeav
ored to Ignore ritualism and rothrash the
stock themes of politics. He was fairly
howled down. His auditors would not be
silenced, when, in his suave, diplomatic
manner, he attempted to slide around the
subject by remarking that no violations
of church law had come to his attention.
be audience insisted that he should de
clare himself, and the meeting broke up
in a manner very like a state of anarchy.
On Wednesday an influential delegation
called on Mr. Balfour and arraigned him
fir advocating the establishment of a
Catholic university in Ireland. He re
plied that the scheme did not represent
the party, but only personal views, and
said: It Is a matter of indifference to
me whether I remain in public life It
is a matter of indifference if I am pre

adds: Englishmen cannot take pride in

friendship.
The Globe says: "Our moral support of
the United States has been of incalcul

lon. In return we require something more
than Admiral Dewey's platonic approval
of the civilizing mission of England."
The paper then proceeds to demand
more assistance in China than heretofore,
and that British commerce should "not be
excluded from territories whose acquisi
tion has been facilitated by England's
action by tariffs."
Judge David J. Brewer, Associate Jus
tice of the United States Supreme Court
who is rturriing home on the Cunard line
steamer Etruria, after his first visit
abroad to attend the preliminary meeting
of the Venezuelan arbitration commission,
said to-day to a representative of the As
sociated Press: "From the public men I
have met here and from others I have
heard only the most cordial feeling ex
pressed toward the United States. So far
as I have been able to judge from my
brief visit the French are quite as friend

In replying to a question Justice Brew
er said: "I know it is being discussed
abroad whether the United States In ac
quiring colonies does not invalidate the
Monroe doctrine. It has the status of a
lawsuit."
Great Britain's business boom keeps
pace with that of the United States. Not
in ten years* has there been such general
prosperity in business and stocks. Apart
from the South African boom, which
maintains its strength unexpectedly, gold
shares are higher than at the height of
the boom In 1895. This feeling of con
fidence may be expected to continue if
the parliamentarians refrain from at
tempting to goad Lord Salisbury to bel
ligerent action, as during tho last ses
sion of Parliament, and provoke counter
threats from other powers. Most of the
stock values have attained a higher level
than in years and an unusually large pro
portion are buying for Investment Instead
of speculation.
As most of the manufacturers here have
all the business they want the increase in
the United States exports attracts less
attention than it would in ordinary times.
The representative of the Illinois Steel
Company, Mr. Holland, speaking of the
steel and iron business, says: "Both the
English and American firms have all the
orders they can fill now. When the time
comes that there is not enough business
for both, the English manufacturers, not
the Americans, it may be predicted, will
be the losers."
The papers are daily reiterating their
warnings of the past two months that
American stocks are destined to a speedy
fall.

late season. The milliners and modistes

McKINLEY AND
GENERAL MILES
President Awaits Report
of Commission.
TO ACCEPT ITS DECISION
THEN WILL FOLLOW RELIEF OF
COMMANDING GENERAL.
Miles May Himself Demand a Court
of Inquiry as to His Conduct
During and Since the
War.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 4.â The Washing
ton correspondent of the Herald tele
graphs: President McKinley will re
ceive on Monday or Tuesday the report
of the War Investigating Commission,
and thereafter will take action in the
case of Major General Miles.
An administration official with whom
I talked to-night said that it would be
injudicious for the President to take
action before the report of the commis
sion is received, although there Is
every reason to believe, as the Herald
has stated, lt will contain grave reflec
tions upon General Miles, and this will
be utilized by the President as the
basis of any proceedings he may take
against that officer.
So far as General Miles' reported in
terviews are concerned it is pointed out
that his denial absolves him from any
responsibility therefor. Furthermore,
the interviews which he admits were
authentic contained no criticism of the
President or Secretary of War, but re
flected upon the contractors who had
supplied bad beef and nauseating can
ned meats. So far as a court of in
quiry tÂ».-ing appointed to investigate the
entire beef controversy it has been as
serted the President proposed to take
the report of the War Investigation
Commission as final and conclusive,
and lt is pointed out that he would dis
credit that body if immediately after its
adjournment he should appoint a court
of inquiry or board of survey to go
over the entire beef question.
As the Herald stated this morning,
however, action by the President di
recting the relief of General Miles will
be followed by his demand for the ap
pointment of a court of inquiry to in
vestigate his conduct, and it is believed
by his friends that the President will
be forced to comply with the demand.
General Miles has not officially heard
from the President or War Department
relative to the intention of the admin
istration respecting his case, and he is
doing nothing in anticipation of action
except in the way of preparing all re
ports and other data bearing upon his
conduct during and since the war. I
was told to-day that he does not pro
pose to make any move until he first
hears from the department

General Monett to-day concluded the tak

CUBAN POLICY
Belief That Feeling of
Unrest Increases.
NATIVES CAN SEE ONLY EVIL
LA LTJCHA PRINTS A LIST OF
ALLEGED GRIEVANCES.
Says Cubans Had Hoped for an Hon
est Administration, but That
Spanish Methods Are Yet
Employed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HAVANA, Feb. Prominent Ameri
cans who are studying the Cuban ques
tion express the belief that if the United
States Government would define its Cu
ban policy it would do much to amelior
ate the feelings of unrest and fear and
the lack of confidence which prevail
among all elements.
From the Cuban standpoint the actions \
of the United States are full of mystery !
and evil portent. If the Government's j
policy was more definitely defined Cuba j
would know who Is to pay the American
army of occupation, and statements 'to
the effect that these moneys are being
collected as Cuban customs would not
evoke troublesome sentiments.
La Lucha prints a long list of Cuba's
alleged Ills from the pen of General En
rique Collazo, from which the following
extracts are taken:
"The Treasury Department expresses
the Intention of giving an honest ad
ministration, but it employs men who
were used to the dishonesties of the Span
ish regime and the Department of Justice
is administered as under Spain. We
hoped, but vainly, that the Americans
would teach us new and better ways It
was logical to believe that they would
break the old molds and build on methods
prevailing in the United States. There
laws based upon the demands of the peo
ple prevail, but in the American admin
istration in Cuba caprice rules with the
swora and the Cubans are throw aside
and almost excommmunlcated.
"The Cubans demanded with one voice
the payment of their army and the United
States responded with insufficient charity
and food. The United States came to
Instruct us in governing; but they will
not let us try to show what we can do.
-hey came to give us independence* but
seem to prepare for annexation. We' may
eventually vote upon the question of an
nexation, but with the reins of govern
ne I , n \. he ha " or the Americans, there
is little hope of a fair expression of the
people s wants. The centralization of
power Is established by the fact that
General Brooke or the Washington Gov
ernment makes the appointments.
\\ c are growing to be a nation of petty
office-seekers; we have no political per
sonality. The ways of the Americans are
daily becoming more incomprehensible
\V c hoped to see the return of prosperity,
but the country cannot pay even the re
duced taxes demanded."
The variety in the rates of exchange of
the Spanish and United States money
causes the Americans _o complain that
they are cheated. The Government em
ployes are paid in large bills and cannot I
get small ones in exchange. Governer
Genera Brooke may consider the fixing
of equitable rates - for local exchange

INTERESTING FIGHT FOR
THE POULETT PEERAGE
New Evidence That Supports the
Claims of the Organ-Grinder
Nobleman.
Special Cable to The Call and the New Tork
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor

LONDON, Feb. 4.â The Poulett peerage
fight has not lost any of its interest. On
the contrary excitement Is rather Increas
ing, for only the other day a search of
documents at Somerset House revealed
the fact that the late Earl's first wife had
three sons, all of whom were registered
in the name of the late Earl. The fact
was also revealed that the Earl lived five
years with the claimant's mother after
marriage, which kills the story that he
deserted her six months after marriage.
The sensation which has been created by
the claims of the organ grinder nobleman
to the Poulett title and estates and the
extraordinary popularity into which he
has sprung, chiefly among the masses,
seems to have become Infectious, for now
more claimants to other estates have ap

An Election Ordered in the Engineer
Division of the Naval Militia.
Welcome for the First
California.
Every member of the National Guard of
the State of California is watching the
Legislature to ascertain what will be
dona by that body with the many bills
that have been presented and which affect
the welfare of the guard. The main bill
Is the one that aims at a reorganization,
hut another that is being discussed is the
one that will afreet the standing of the
men who are now at Manila. This bill,
Introduced with a view to clear the rolls,
provides that all men who enlisted ln the
volunteer service for the Spanish-Ameri
can war shall be discharged from the ser
vice of the State, and lt provides that all
men who were in the National Guard of
the State for 100 days prior to enlistment
shall, if after being mustered out of the
volunteer service, re-enlist in the National
Guard, be allowed time as lf they never
had been out of the guard. This is for
the purpose of protecting the men as to
exemption service and ten-year continu
ous service. But there is one question
that has been raised in connection with
this bill and that is as to how it will af
fect those men who enlisted in the service
of the United States, such as the Seventh
and the Sixth California, who have been
mustered out of that service, and have re
turned to their former positions in the
guard. It is claimed that the men of these
commands were not discharged from the â¢
State Guard while they were In the United
States service, but as soon as they were
mustered out of Uncle Sam's service they
resumed their former places, and so far
as the record shows, hey never were
out of the guard of the State. It is
claimed that according to the provisions
of the hill introduced these men will have
to be discharged and then sworn In anew.
The bill that has been introduced in re
lation to the allowances and payments for
expenses incurred for the guard provides
that there shall be .1 general paymaster.
That Is to have for its purpose the doing
away with company allowances and lt is
claimed that there will be an equalization
of expenses and also a reduction. As it
ls now a company in one section ls al
lowed a lump sum monthly with which to
meet certain expenses. Another company
in another section is allowed a similar
sum, the former company pays $50 a
month armory rent, while the other pays
only $15, so one company has so much
more than the other for "general" ex
penses, It is claimed that under the bill
offered the State will pay only for just
exactly what the State receives.
Lieutenant Colonel Adolph Huber has
been ordered to preside at an election to
be held on the U. S. S. Marion on the 14th
Inst., when there will be a meeting to se
lect officers tor the engineer division of
the naval militia. The offices to be filled l

POSTUM CEREAL.
DR. HOWARD
Tells His Experience With Coffee.
I am pleased to add my help to your
campaign of instruction on the subject
of coffee drinking. For ten or twelve
years I have been a severe sufferer
from that cause.
I gradually abandoned everything
from time to time that I thought pro-
duced the extreme nervousness from
which I suffered, and all of my very
frequent calls on my fellow physicians
resulted in no benefit until I was ad-
vised to do without coffee.
My condition at that time was such
that I was certain that I had heart
disease In one of its worst forms.
Many a night 1 have retired not ex-
pecting to live to see morning. The
action was so feeble and slow that It
would run as low as 38 to 40, and never
80, unless I was taking some severe
exercise or using some stimulant.
My experience In examining patients
who presented themselves for opera-
tions under an anesthetic led me to
continually compare my condition with
theirs, and life was made very miser-
able for me by such comparisons.
1 also suffered from a constant mus-
cular contraction of the fleshy portion
of the left hand, a technical descrip-
tion of which I will not undertake in
this letter, but I could not get rid of
the trouble.-
These conditions, with a constantly
sour stomach, a feeling of extreme
faintness about an hour before regu-
lar meal time, and a sallow complex-
lon, give you a general idea of the
shape I was in just before I discon-
tinued the use of coffee. It was very
hard to give up coffee, but I was com-
pelled to do so, and for a while used
water and milk. Then I tried a so-
called cereal coffee, which I have since
learned is made partly of coffee and
partly of browned grains, and is sold
as an imitation of your Postum. This
did not work, so I went back to the
â¢water and milk until about a year ago
I trot hold of Postumâ the genuine.
Since then I have had one cup and
sometimes two every morning, and
frequently for dinner at night. My
health was never better than lt Is now,
no nervousness or muscular contrac-
tion, no heart trouble or sour stom-
ach, and the pulse running from 70
to 76.
At the time I was suffering from the
effects of coffee I made application
for some life insurance, and was re-
jected on account of the action of my
heart. To show what the abstinence
of coffee and the drinking of Postum
will do, and has done for me, I will
say that in March last I was examined
for life insurance and passed a most
excellent examination. Having gone
through the very disagreeable exper-
ience and been relieved from the
trouble, it is but natural that I should
feel a willingness to assist you all I can
In your work, for I do not believe one
person in ten has a realizing sense of
the damage to the nervous system
caused by the consumption of coffee.

NOTED DIPLOMAT
BOUND FOR MANILA
Ll WING VOW, Consul General to Havana,
Transferred to the Philippines.
LI WING VOW, his Imperial Majesty's Consul General to Havana, ls here.
He arrived on the Overland last .Friday, and was accompanied by his son,
La Kuong, and Lee Ka Luck, his interpreter and secretary, and was es
corted to the local Chinese Consulate, where he will remain as guest until
his departure to Manila.
His arrival brings to light an Important change that has taken place at this
consulate. Chang Yum Tung, who has acted as Consul General here for several
years, will leave Immediately for Havana to fill the vacancy caused by Ll Wing
Vow's transfer to the newly established consulate In the Philippines, and Ho
Vow, who has been acting as Consul, has been promoted to the important office
vacated by Consul General Tung.
The distinguished visitor, prior to his stay ln Havana, was a resident of this
city. For six years he occupied the Consul General's home on Stockton street,
and looked after the destinies of the many thousand members of his race living
In this State. As is the custom of his Government, which is to move Its diplomats
frequently from post to post, he was transferred to Cuba.
During his residence ln the Antilles he states that he was accorded the most
courteous treatment from the Spanish offliclals and people, and at no time dur
ing the exciting scenes in Cuba's capital were the lives of himself and coun
trymen ln jeopardy. Now he Is ordered to Manila to fill the important post that
was created since the occupation of that city by the American troops. As tne
Philippines are Inhabited by nearly a million Chinese the position ls considered
the most Important one in the Chinese consular service. Consul General Vow
will be accompanied by Lee Ka Luck, who joined him at Washington, and who
will act as secretary and interpreter.
Consul General Vow ls 40 years of age, and ls a descendant of an aristo
cratic family. In his own country he is entitled to the rank of To Tai, which is
equivalent to a Lieutenant Governor. He has a slight acquaintance with the Eng
lish and Spanish tongues, having gained his knowledge during his long resi
dence In the United States and Cuba.
Within the next week Ho Vow, the newly appointed Consul General to tnis
city, will take his seal and oath of office. He has already received his commis
sion, but a formal ceremony Is necessary before he takes up his official duties.
tenant John T. McMillan (Junior grade),
who, prior to the breaking out of the
Spanish-American war, was the Instruc
tor* of the officers in the art of navigation,
being in the city, will be present to par
take of the officers' hospitality.
The men of the two local divisions have
almost completed the arrangements for
the entertainment and ball to be l given on
board of the Marion on the night of the
22d inst. There will be a good programme
of music, songs and literary efforts, after
which the deck will be cleared and there
will be dancing. ; , _ . .
The members of the National Guard In
this city are making preparations for tne
reception of the First California \ olun
teers when they return from Manila. At a
meeting of a number of the officers Ol the
division staff and members of the citizens
committee that is moving to have the
men returned to this city, it was decided
that whatever shall be done shall be the
work of the two committees. If the regi
ment returns as a body it is proposed to
meet it at the landing and escort It to a
place to be designated. All military,
semi-military and civic bodies will he
asked to take part as organizations in the
grand welcome. If the regiment comes
in detachments another programme will
be prepared, but the details have not yet
been outlined. Whatever rt may be, the
returning Californians will have a rous
ing reception. Â, ~.
It ls reported that there will be no more
discharges at the islands and that trie
men of the First California will be mus
tered out in San Francisco. There is some
talk that they may be expected on the
Scandia- , ._ _ .
Advices from Manila are to the effect
that in Company I of the California tirst
fifty-five men of the company had applied
for discharges from the service, and that
the majority of the men in the regiment
will follow the example of the fit ty-nve.
Private Charles Stewart of Company I
has arranged a prayer which he declares
has met the approbation not only of the
men In the company but of the regiment.
It Is as follows: __ '". .
"Our father who art in Washington,
McKinley is thy name, we have remem
bered the Maine, to H-ades with Spain,
we won't volunteer again.'
One of the gallant First has sent up a
clipping from Freedom, one of the Amer
ican papers published ln Manila, which
reads as follows: .*yy . . ,
"The barbarous Spaniards constructed
sentry-boxes to protect their soldiers from
the sun during the heat of the day. The
humane Americans despise such relics of
an effete monarchy and make their sol
diers tramp it up and down with the rays
of the scorching sun pouring down on
their heads. Thereby they add to the
1 already large number in the hospital.
Above all. let us be military; to any old
place with common-sense.'*
WANT WATER HOLES FILLED.
Precita Valley Improvement Club
Will Petition the Supervisors.
The members of the Precita Valley Im
provement Club are about to Institute an
active fight to have the offensive water
holes, which lie between Army street and
Precita avenue, filled in. That portion of
the creek bed lying east of Bryant street
has become offensive by reason of its In
closed condition, retaining pools of stag
nant water the entire year round.
On the surface of this stagnant water
has grown a mass of green matter,
which breeds myriads of Insects during
the summer season, and which infest the
neighborhood. Besides this, the mias
matic eeffcts of this nuisance has already
been felt in the payment of doctors' and
undertakers' bills.
The club at its last meeting passed a
resolution condemning the existence of
these disease-breeding cesspools and ap
pointed a committee to wait on the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1899.
MAY HAVE THE
MACHINES, BUT
NOT FOR USE
Nickel -in -Slot Ma-
chines Released.
DECISION AGAINST LEES
Justice Groezinger Orders the Return
of the Property, but Holds They
Cannot Be Used for
Gaming.
Justice G. C. Groezinger decided yester
day that the nickel-in-the-slot machines
seized and held by Chief of Police Lees
must be returned to the owners. The de
cision recites that the machine is a
gambling device, but that there is no law
in this State which authorizes the police
or any person to seize gambling devices.
Having been seized there is no law which
authorizes their destruction.
Many authorities are cited In which it
is laid down that a person cannot be de
prived of any property, not even gambling
devices, until a Judicial tribunal has ad
judged them to be such, and that such
property. cannot be destroyed until after
the defendant has had his day in court
They also hold that where no law exists
authorizing a magistrate to order prop
erty destroyed, it cannot be done, nor can
it be seized unless thero is a law au
thorizing such seizure.
The mere . possession of this machine
without an intent to commit a crime is
no offense. At common law the playing
of cards and dice, when practiced inno
cently and as a recreation, is not un
lawful or punishable as an offense
The questions involved were as to the
ownershop of the machines, and whether
Chief Lees could seize and destroy them
Judge Cook, in a recent case, decided that
machines in which cigars are offered
could not be suppressed. In that case the
owners were arrested under the lottery
laws and not on the ground that they
were conducting a gambling game
It is a matter of common notoriety that

chines used in the cigar stands through
out the city. Â°
The following sweeping clanse in the
decision shows how little power the po
lice have to destroy devices for gambling*
"Counsel for defendant also claims that
this machine is contraband, and defend
ant has a right to seize and destroy it
wherever found. Such power the Chief
of Police of this city does not possess
nor does any other human being within
the city and county possess it, as is clear
ly established by the foregoing authori
ties.
"The court has personal knowledge of
the fact that this sort of a machine as
well as the 'cigar machine,' is I, great
use in this city. The latter's use Is per
mitted through some decision by our Su
perior Court, and yet this 'cigar machine'
is just as much a gambling device as the
machine under consideration."
The decision continues:
"Irrespective of the question as to who
is entitled to this machine, I can see no
reason why the owners (the plaintiffs
In this action) should not have possession
of lt. They cannot use it for gambling
purposes, nor can any other person use
it for that purpose. If they do :hey are
amenable to the law and punishable un
der lt.
"There ls ample opportunity afforded at
the present time to have the proper laws
passed by calling the matter to the at
tention of the Legislature. I coincide in
the language of his Honor Carroll Cook
in the case of the People vs. Deutsch
'that courts must take the law as It Is
written, and have no more right to Inter
polate something into a statute than to
leave something out.' If our laws respect
ing the seizure, detention and destruction
of gambling devices are defective, It is
for the legislative branch of the Govern
ment to remedy the defect or pass the
necessary statute."

Captain Johnson of the Hawaiian bark
Roderick Dhu played ln hard luck during
this last voyage. When flve days out from
Hilo the vessel was within 900 miles of San
Francisco, and Captain Johnson was fig
uring on beating all previous records.
The wind then turned contrary, and for
four days not even a fair day's run was
made. Then the hoped for change took
place, but instead of the breeze coming
from the south it blew from the north
west, and lt took three more days for the
Roderick Dhu to make port,
The first day out from Hilo the clipper
ran 245 miles. Next day the wind held
good, and when the run was figured out
It was found the bark had logged 260
miles. All the morning of the third day
Captain Johnson rubbed his hands to
gether and felt at peace with all the world
as he looked over the side and watched
his ship glide through the water. During
that twenty-four hours the Roderick Dhu
covered 290 nautical miles. The fourth
day the run was 275 miles and the fifth
200 miles. The latter figure was only
reached once during the remainder of the
voyage.
Even as It Is, the run of the Roderick
Dhu is the best that has been made for
a long time. The schooner Esther Buhne,
that got ln from Honolulu yesterday, was
twenty-three days on the way, while the
fast brig Consuelo is now out fifteen days.
The schooner Aloha and the barkentine !
Archer took twenty-one days, while the
bark Mohican and barkentine Planter
each took twenty days to come from the
Islands. So, all in all. Captain Johnson
has not much cause for complaint. The
Roderick Dhu brought from Hilo nine
cabin passengers and 19,000 bags of sugar.
The Assembly Committee on the San
Francisco Water Front came down from
Sacramento last Friday night, and went
around the bay on the State tug Gov
ernor Markham yesterday. Those who
went were: Knowland (chairman), De
voto, Brooke, Sullivan, Hanley, Conrey
and Merritt, Harbor Commissioners Col
non and Harney and Rudolph Herold Jr.
The wharves and docks were inspected
and the proposed extension of the seawall
south to the Mall dock waa discussed.
The Commissioners pointed out the ur
gent necessity for more dockage facili
ties, and the Assemblymen were all of the
opinion that the proposed extension
should begin at once.
After the wharves had been examined,
the Markham was run up as far as Hunt
ers Point, during which time refreshments
were served. To-day the Assemblymen
will be the guests of Captain Castle for
a cruise outside the heads on the pilot
boat Bonlta.
It is not so many years ago that scrap
iron was in great demand in San Fran
cisco, and vessels from Bombay and Cal
cutta came here with loads of old rails
and scraps. Things have changed, how
ever since the rolling mills closed down,
and now there is an accumulation of over
5000 tons of the stuff. It has to be got rid
of somehow, so G. W. McNear has char
tered the Italian bark Cavallere Ciampa,
and she will take a load of the stuff to
Genoa, Italy. The charter price is 27
shillings and 6 pence a ton, and If possible
another vessel will be secured at the same
rate to take the remainder of tire load.
Labor is cheap in Italy, so the old rails
and scraps can be worked up In the foun
dries there, while the San Francisco con
cerns cannot pay a living wage and han
dle the stuff.
Captain Charles Nelson Is having built
at Bendlxsen's yards in Eureka a fine
new four-masted schooner of about 650
tons. She will be 165 feet on the keel, 38
feet beam and 15 feet 11 inches deep.
The little schooner Bessie E. Stevens
is ready to sail for Manila with a cargo
of California wine. She is 46 feet 4 inches
long, 15 feet 2 inches broad and 6 feet
deep. She has one deck and two masts,
and Captain B. Havner says he expects
her to make a fast run to the Philippines.
The Stevens will carry a crew of five,
besides the captain, and they all say they
would just as soon sail in the little
schooner as in a full-rigged ship.
Chief Engineer Nieman of the steamer
Australia has a magnificent mastiff at his
home in Berkeley, for which he would like
to find an owner. The animal attached
itself to the genial engineer on the
Oceanic wharf, and, do what he would,
the mastiff was on hand to superintend.
When Nieman started across the bay the
dog followed, and the chief tried to lose
him in the crowd, but when he reached
the deck of the steamer the dog was there
waiting for him. The animal has de
veloped a magnificent appetite, and the
sooner the owner turns up the better will
Chief Nieman be pleased.
Chief Officer McEwen of the Peru is a
very sick man. and will not be able to
go out on the vessel's next voyage to

school of navigation.
A YELLOW FAKE EXPOSED.
An Inval-d's Death Made the Occa-

A yellow Journal published an account
yesterday morning of the sudden death of
Thomas Knight, assistant janitor of the
Alliance building 416 California street,
and in glaring headlines hinted at a pois
oning or some other mysterious means of
murder. . --; -r
Investigation by the Coroner yesterday
revealed the fact that the article was a
pure fake. Knight had been ailing with
heart disease for years, and the autopsy
by Autopsy Surgeon Zabala showed that
decedent was suffering from heart dis
ease, pneumonia and appendicitis and that
death was due to a complication of the
three. The jury rendered a verdict of
death from natural causes.

Three Runaway Boys in the Potrero
Arrested on a Charge of
Burglary.
The small boy is becoming quite a factor ln crime, and recently he has
been accused of train-wrecking, burglary and other offenses of a like char
acter. The latest additions to the list are three small boysâ Joseph Stevens,
14 years of age, whose parents live at 316 Utah street: George Clennell, 12
years of age, 120 Mississippi street, and Eddie Overant. 11 years of age, 519
Minnesota street. They were arrested yesterday morning by Lieutenant
Anderson and Policeman Lewis of the Potrero on a charge of burglary and
taken to the City Prison.
The boys ran away from home Wednesday night and took up their
residence in the cellar of a house on Mariposa street. They had food with
them to last for a day, but when that was finished they were puzzled to
know how to get further supplies. Eddie Overant, the youngest of the trio,
went to his home and unobserved got away with some food and took it to
his two companions in the cellar. Yesterday morning they were hungry and
they went on a foraging expedition. While passing the house of George Sy
mon, 124 Mississippi street, Clennell suggested that they break into the cellar
where Mrs. Symon kept her household stores, and the suggestion was
promptly carried into effect. They stole several cans of deviled ham, peaches,
pears and apricots, a can-opener and two bars of soap. The soap was
taken, as they wanted to use it in washing themselves, as they had not
been able to do so since leaving their homes, and it was the soap that led to
their confession of the burglary.
The boys hurried with their plunder to their cellar on Mariposa street
and in a short time all the ham and fruit was consumed. Meantime Mrs.
Symon had discovered the fact that her supplies had been stolen and she no
tified the Potrero police. Lieutenant Anderson and Policeman Lewis soon,
found the boys in their cellar and placed them under arrest. They had not
time to wash themselves, and the two bars of soap were discovered and
booked as evidence against them, as well as the can-opener.
Clennell and Overant are very small, and say that they left home be
cause they did not like being whipped for not going to the Irving Scott
School. Eddie said that his stepfather was good to him, but his step
father's father was constantly whipping him. Stevens said he was looking
for a Job at the Union Iron Works and wanted to work. The police say tho
boys are bad, and they will likely be sent to the Boys' and Girls' Aid So
ciety.
WILL BE PROSECUTED.
The Five Boys Charged With At
tempting to Wreck a Train
Arraigned.
The Southern Pacific Company does not
intend to drop the prosecution of the flve
boys arrested Wednesday on tho track
between Twenty-sixth and Army streets
by Special Officer Madden. Their names
are Oscar Wilson. Charles White. Charles
Troleson. Charles Burke and Frank Par-
Trie boys appeared before Acting Police
i Judge Barry yesterday to answer to a
Marge of attempting to wreck a train,
hey were instructed and arraigned, and
I by consent the case was continued till
to-morrow afternoon.
Attorney Kelly, for the company, says
that the case will be prosecuted to the
bitter end. "A funeral train passed the
spot where the stones were found by Mad
den." he said, "just a minute afterward,
i and if the train had been derailed and
1 several lives lost the boys would have
I been to blame. Wilson, one of the boys,
j was arrested a few days ago for steal-
I ing a horse and buggy along with two
other boys, and he is a bad boy."
"SENT UP" FOR LIFE.
Robber Lynch Suffers the Greatest
Penalty Allowed by the Law.
J. E. Lynch, recently convicted of the
crime of robbery, and who had the mis
fortune to suffer six prior convictions,
was sentenced to life imprisonment in San
Quentin by Judge Cook yesterday morn
ing. Lynch was arrested for robbing
Frank Nones of $1 50 on October 14 last.
He was a desperate character, and his
loss to local society will not occasion
great regret.
John McCronk, who pleaded guilty to
burglary in the second degree, was sen
tenced to five years' imprisonment in
Folsom by Judge Dunne.
Received the Flag.
Late last fall the ladies of the Silk Cul
ture Society made a beautiful silk flag,
full military size, which they sent to the
boys of the First Regiment, stationed at
Manila. The committee having the mat
ter in charge consisted of Mrs. Theodore
Hittel. Mrs. Mary Murphy and Mrs. Wil
liam Kirk. The beautiful present was
sent to Manila in care of General Miller
on the transport Newport. Yesterday the
ladies received a letter from Colonel
Smith, in which he thanked the donors in

WOULD SELL THE
CONTROL OF THE
PANAMA CANAL
M. Hutir) to MaKe a Desperate
Bluff at Washington to Save
His Big Ditch.
O Call Office, Riggs House, Washington, February 4. O
O By the time the House is ready to take up the Nicaragua canal O
O bill the promoters of the Panama canal project will arrive in Wash- O
O ington and make a last desperate effort to have their substitute O
O scheme endorsed by the Senate. O
O M. Rutin, superintendent of the Panama canal, ls on hfs way from O
O Panama to America with a proposition which he will lay before the O
O President and Congress for the sale of the control of that property O
O to the United States. He will be in New York the flrst of next O
O week and will hasten to Washington to lay the matter before the Q
O proper parties. When M. Hutin was in this country a few weeks O
O ago, he learned enough to satisfy himself that the United States O
O was bound to have an Isthmian canal and he determined to make a O
O deal with this Government; and further decided that he must not de- O
O lay matters. He hastened back to France and presented the facts as O
O he found them to the stockholders. The stockholders were averse O
O to selling the control to the United States, but were informed that if O
O they did not do this, or secure the help of European Governments, O
O ruin stared them in the face. O
. Â© M. Hutin now comes loaded with threats that if the United O
O States refuses to support his cause the control of that property will O
O be turned over to a combination of European powers, consisting of O
O France, Germany, Austria and Russia. It is claimed on behalf of the Q
O French owners of the canal that they have assurances the necessary d
O backing can be obtained by turning the canal over to these allied O
O nations. O

LONG'S ACTION
CAUSES COMMENT
Board to Report on
Schley and Sampson.
SECRETARY VERY CAREFUL
DETERMINED TO SHOW THE
SENATE HE IS NOT BIASED.
One of the Officers Appointed Is
Lieutenant Sears, a Known Par
tisan of Rear Admiral
Schley.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. 4.â Washington
special to the Herald says: Secretary
Long has written a letter to the Senate
announcing that he has organized a board
to collect all data bearing upon the con
duct of Rear Admirals Sampson and
Schley during the late war, and that this
report will be forwarded as soon as re
ceived.
The action of the department, as ex
clusively announced in the Herald this
morning, caused a great deal of comment
in naval circles. It is frankly stated at
the department that the Secretary was
careful to designate as members of the
board officers who participated in the
battle of Santiago, and that there might
be no claim that the board was organized
in the interests of the administration or
of Rear Admiral Sampson, it was deter
mined to appoint to membership a known
partisan Of Rear Admiral Schley. This
officer Is Lieutenant J. H. Sears, who was
flag lieutenant on the staff of Rear Ad
miral Schley while that officer was in
command of the flying squadron and after
the abolition of that command of the
second squadron of the North Atlantic
fleet.
it is said of Lieutenant Sears that after
the battle of Santiago he went to the
telegraph office at Playa del Este with a
dispatch signed by Rear Admiral Schley,
addressed to Secretary Long, announcing
the victory over Admiral Cervera's fleet,
but that he was prevented from Bending it
by Lieutenant S. A. Staunton, flag lieu
tenant on the staff of Rear Admiral
Sampson, who pointed out to him that
under the regulations all dispatches must
pass through the hands of the commander
in chief.

tilled the big tent, it was a representative
society gathering. The boxes were tilled,
and the juenesse doree was out in force.

contest: a parade of winners in the class
for saddle horses; a parade for winners in
the classes for horses in harness and car

Americans Get Around
the Exclusion Act.
HAVE FOUND A METHOD
â **
HIRE CANADIANS TO ACT AS
THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.
Attempt to Bar Aliens Has a Blight
ing Effect Upon the Cities of
the British North
west. "
BY HAL HOFFMAN.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
JUNEAU, Alaska, Jan. 31 (by
steamship Al-Kl to Seattle, Feb. 4).â
They did not know anything about the
exclusion act at Atlln Lake diggings up
to a week ago yesterday, which is the
latest date on which anyone left there
and arrived out. Building operations
are at a standstill there, but for rea
sons other than the law shutting out
aliens. A deputy gold commissioner,
representing Gold Commissioner Gra
ham, who has made his headquarters
for this winter at Bennett, arrived at
Atlln and proceeded to enforce the
law requiring a logger's license to cut
timber; also exacting 25 cents stump
age, and 25 cents a cord for wood used
as fuel. The man who told me this to
day, said complainingly, that he sup
posed by this time everybody had been
compelled to take out a license to
breathe.
The immediate effect of this action
was to stop the construction of cabins
and all other buildings except those be
ing erected by companies or persons
having plenty of money. Scores of
cabins and small stores remain stand
ing in various stages of completion.
This deputy is said to have temporar
ily stopped real estate transfers.
As most of the buildings, and active
operations in general, are being built
or backed by Americans, when the news
of the exclusion act becomes known
there it is expected to have, at least
temporarily, the effect of a cold shower.
But he is a poor Yankee whose in
genuity does not arise to the occasion â
who does not know more than one way
to skin a rabbit. American claim hold
ers here and at Skaguay are looking
for Canadians to represent them on
shares after the clean-up. The only
difficulty about this encountered up to
the present time seems to be that there
are not Canadians enough up here or in
Atlin to go around. The proportion of
Americans to Canadians in Atiin or
Alaska coast cities is about ten to one.
On this account many are thinking of
going down to Victoria and Vancouver
to find Canadians to become nominal
owners of their claims, and some have
already started.
Atlin City is now a camp of about
thirty buildings and still growing. It
is not thought that the present setback
in building will be any more serious
than a temporary thing. It is under
stood there and in the coast towns that
aliens may engage in any and all busi
ness except mining. If this proves to
be true, there will be a large and lively
camp at Atlin anyhow. The question
of which place, Atlin or Discovery, is
to be the metropolis of the Atlin Lake
region, seems to have been pretty well
determined already. There are almost
four times as many buildings at Atlin
City as at Discovery, and a proportion
ate amount of all-round activity.
Skaguay has just received the first
severe shock to her pride and promise.
The exclusion act did it. I have just
returned from a trip of inspection
there, and the difference is apparent to
a careful observer as he gets uptown.
The railroad and occasional trains run
ning on Broadway look quite metro
politan, where a little more than a year
ago was a howling wilderness dotted
with tents, and the depot is large, com
modious and lofty. There are many
cities in California twice the size of
Skaguay which have not as good rail
road stations. But business at the
present time is comparatively 'at a
standstill, and merchants are complain
ing. They stand mutely appalled at the
depressing effect.
The general impression in all Alaska
is that the exclusion act, in view of the
opposing general sentiment in Canada
and the United States against it, will
shortly be repealed, or, anyway, it will
not be enforced. The effect in Juneau
is not so visible, as the bulk of the
travel to the interior is by way of
Skaguay and White Pass, but this will
possibly change, as the availability of
the Taku trail becomes more widely
known.
A serious demonstration against the
exclusion act took place last Saturday
evening before the American Deputy
Collector of Customs. Considerable
feeling was shown, but there is no dan
ger yet of a serious outbreak. About
forty teamsters and packers working
between Skaguay and "White Pass
called on Deputy Collector Andrews
and protested against the Canadians'
horses packing outfits and other pack
ing property used on the trail and asked
him to take action with the object of
forcing them to stop operations. These
horses are undeniably Canadian and
are used chiefly in competing with
American packers and pack trains in
carrying Canadian goods in bond to the
lakes. Every American horse which
goes over the summit and beyond the
Canadian customs post there must pay
duty. The drivers of pack trains are a
determined lot of men when once
aroused and trouble may occur at any
time unless their employers, the owners
of the pack trains, keep them in check.
The deputy collector told the delegation
that he did not see what he could do
for them or what the department could
do. but said he would lay the matter
before the Collector for Alaska, J. W.
Ivey, who is now In Washington, D. C,
looking sharp that his official scalp re
mains in place. And thus the matter
rests at present.
Frank Grey, accompanied by "Path
finder" H. W. Powell, has returned
from an inspection trip of the Taku
trail, from Juneau to Atlin. Mr. Grey
represents Canadian capital Invested in
stern-wheel steamboats and in horses
which did not operate on the Stickeen
River and trail from Wrangel last win
ter owing to the failure of that trail.
He is from Vancouver and is an expe
rienced packer. Mr. Grey has been over
all the trails to the interior and he sav3
that the Taku is the easiest of all.
There is no summit to cross, and with
a broken trail he says that a team can
haul three tons on the ice all day long,
the ascent being scarcely perceptible.
He proposes to establish relay posts
from -the mouth of the river to Atlln.
where fresh horses can be had for pack
trains, by which, means he expects to be
able to haul- goods into Atlin in two
days. The company also expects to run
the steamers on the river in the spring
when the ice breaks up. There is plenty
of grass on the trail for horses in the
summertime. Small steamers now leave
Juneau every few days with parties for
the Taku trail." The Miller party, which
started in two weeks ago with several

GRAND ARMY LOSES
ITS COMMANDER
Colonel James A. Sexton Passes
Away at Garfield Hospital in
Washington. '
WASHINGTON. Feb. s.â Colonel James
A. Sexton, comander-In-chlef of the
Grand Army of the Republic, died at 3:15
this morning at Garfield Hospital ln this
city.
James A. Sexton was born January 5,
1544, In Chicago. At the outbreak of the
civil War Sexton enlisted in the three
months' service and went out as a pri
vate. At the expiration of that time he
was appointed sergeant and authorized to
recruit Company I, Fifty-first Volunteer
Infantry. In June, 1862, he was
transferred to Company E, Sixty
seventh Illinois Infantry, and promot
ed to a lieutenancy. Within three
months he was elected captain of a com
pany recruited under the auspices of the
Young Men's Christian Association of
Chicago, which became Company D,
Seventy-second Illinois. He commanded
this regiment in the battles of Columbia,
Duck River, Spring Hill. Franklin and
Nashville, and throughout the Nashville
campaign. In 1865 he was assigned to
the staff of General A. S. Smith, Sixteenth
Army Corps, acting as provost marshal,
and served until the close of the war.
At Spanish Port his left leg was broken
by a piece of shell, and he received gun
shot wounds at Franklin and Nashville.

ln seven battles and eleven skirmishes,
being under the enemy's fire 145 days.
The regiment went to war with 967 men
and officers and came back with 332. Dur
ing Its three years' service it recruited
234 men.
At the close of the war Colonel Sexton
bought a plantation in Alabama and tilled
It until his return to Chicago, two years
later. He then engaged In the foundry
and stove business and built up one of the
largest manufacturing concerns ln Chi
cago. He retired from this company only
a few months ago.
Colonel Sexton was appointed Post
master In Chicago by President Harrison
ln 1889. He served five years and instituted
many reforms.

place in this city to-day. The Canadian
members of the High Joint Commission

wa arrived David Mills. A. C. Blair.
William Fielding and Clifford Sifton.
members of the Laurier Cabinet. J. S.
Tarte, another member of the Cabinet,
is expected to arrive later. The Min
isters from Ottawa met Sir Wilfrid
Laurier and the High Joint Commis
sioners at the Waldorf-Astoria and a
long conference was held. It was said
that the matter under discussion was
connected with the proceedings of the
International conference, and it was
presumed that Sir Wilfrid Laurier, be
fore deciding upon some possibly im
portant point, desired to personally
confer with his Ministers and had
adopted the plan of meeting in New
York as being more convenient. The
conference will probably extend over
until Monday, when Sir Wilfrid Lau
rier and his fellow-members of that
commission will return to Washington
and the other Ministers will return to
Ottawa.
PROBABLY A PLAY
FOR RAPPROACHMENT
An Incident on Board of a German
Warship That Is Made Much
of by Frenchmen.
. PARIS, Feb. 4.â Two German training
ships, the Charlotte and Stosch, are at
present In the Mediterranean, visiting
Algerian ports. Some surprise was
created by their putting into Oran the
other day. At present they are at Al
giers.
It looks as though Germany is also
making a bid for rappoachment, for when
a pilot boarded the Charlotte at Oran and
began to give his directions in English
her commander. Captain Vulllers, stopped
him with the observation, "They only
speak two languages on board our ves
selsâGerman and French. >.-...â *
This looks like a pin prick for England.
The French papers chortle over the In
cident. After all, as the eloiguement took
place on land, rapproachment may well
be attempted on sea.
Stanford Loses at Baseball.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 4.â
Stanford lost the baseball game to-day to
the Fireman's Fund Insurance team;
score 4 to 0. Both teams showed up well
but Stanford was weak at the bat. Lana
gan and Scherer twirled for Stanford.
Lanagan did fine work,. holding the visi
tors down to four scattered hits in the
six Innings he pitched. Scherer, a fresh
man, was then given a trial. He is a
"south paw," and has good speed, but
was rather wild. Krug, for the visitors,
did good work in the box, allowing but
five hits oft his delivery. Stanford's
freshman third baseman, Wright, will
prove a good man for that position. With
proper coaching Stanford should be able
to put up a good team against Berkeley
In the intercollegiate games next April.

SALMON CANNING
TRUST ORGANIZED
Will Control the Puget
Sound Output.
EXPENDS A MILLION DOLLARS
THIRTY-FIVE FISH TRAPS
ALREADY PURCHASED.
.
Immense Cannery Will Be Built at
Fairhaven, Wash., to Handle
the - Entire
Catch.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Feb. 4.â A special from
I Fairhaven, Wash., says a trust is being
j formed to control the salmon output of
Puget Sound. Already thirty-five of
I the best-located fish traps in Whatcom
| and Skagit counties have been pur
chased, and others, are being negotiated
for. The deal has been conducted so
! secretly that nobody suspected what
was in progress until to-day. The pub
lic has not yet heard of it. Options on
fish traps were secured thirty to sixty
days ago by R. Onffrey and E. Bartlett
i Webster, representing themselves and
capitalists of Chicago and New York.
Ten days ago the . options were taken
up and the first payments, due Febru
ary 1, were promptly met.
Over $1,000,000 is said to be involved
in the deal, three-quarters of which
will be spent in acquiring fish traps
and other sources of supply, together
with appliances. An immense cannery
will be built at Fairhaven and, as far
as possible, the trust will can the entire
catch of Its traps.
For the past four years the salmon
canning business of Puget Sound has
been growing by leaps and bounds. The
new Canadian regulations are driving
Frazer River canners to American
waters and it was expected many new
canneries would be erected this season.
The formation. of the salmon trust will
change these plans. Since the new
canneries must obtain their supply
from the traps which the trust has
purchased, the trust will hold the key
to the situation so far as salmon can
ning is concerned. Together with the
Alaska Packers' Association, owning
immense canneries at Blame and Point
Roberts, it will be able to dictate the
price of fish and, consequently, the
price of canned salmon.
The traps secured by Onffrey and
Webster include the most famous
money-makers on the lower sound
traps which have fairly coined money
for their owners during good seasons.
Among them are Wright's, Pike's, Kil
dale's and Alsop's. It is believed the
purchasers are connected with Booth's
fish trust, recently organized in Chi
cago, and having for its object the con
trol of all important sources of fish
supply in the United States.
COLUMBIA RIVER COMBINE.
Twelve Canneries Consolidated in
One Large Trust.
PORTLAND, Or.. Feb. 4.â The Co
lumbia River salmon cannery men who
had executed â¢ options for the transfer
of their properties to the Columbia
River Packers' Association have ar
rived at an agreement. It is said all
necessary papers were signed to-day
consolidating these canneries into that
association. The association consists
of seven of the most extensive salmon
packers, controlling twelve canneries
in all, and representing about 75 per
cent of the total pack of canned sal
mon on the lower Columbia River. None
of the packers of upper river fish are
members of the association.
The capital stock of the new organi
zation is $2,000,000, all of which has
been paid, either in cash or cannery
properties. A meeting of stockholders
will be held in Astoria on Monday next
for the election of a board of directors
It is said the present plants will be en
larged in order to increase the output
the coming season.
Snow in Marin County.
SAN : RAFAEL. Feb. 4.â Snow fell for
over two hours yesterday throughout a

TRAGEDY AT LOS ANGELES
TALLY-HO OVERTURNS WITH
ITS OCCUPANTS.
The Victim of the Disaster a Member
of the Firm That Is Building
the San Pedro Break
water.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 4.â Peter W.
Neu, Junior member of the well-known
Chicago contracting Arm of Heldmaier
& Neu, met with an accident this after
noon that caused almost instantaneous
death. Neu, in company with his fore
man, J. S. Anunsen, Hancock Banning,
president of the Banning Coal Com
pany and owner of the Catalina Island
summer resort, and a dozen others,
made up a tally-ho party which enjoyed
a few moments of the pleasures of the
horse show which is being held in this
city. At the conclusion of the after
noon performance the party drove
through various parts of the city. When
the tally-ho reached the corner of
Grand avenue and Washington street,
at 5:45 o'clock, the front axle broke,
causing the fally-ho to lurch to the
left side. The occupants were thrown
to the street, landing in a heap.
The seats of the tally-ho were eight
feet above the ground. Neu occupied
one seat removed from the center. As
the occupants were thrown forward
Neu's head struck a post which is used
to hold the trolley wires of the street
cars at the point where the accident
occurred. Neu, who weighed 260 pounds,
being thrown from such a height and
landing on the left side of his head,
received a fracture which Dr. Mc-
Arthur says extended from the left eye
for several Inches beyond the left ear
and undoubtedly caused dislocation of
the spine.
Pedestrians hurried to the scene and j
rendered all aid possible. Neu was !
heard to mutter, "Help me out, help
me out." Then, quickly turning his
head to one side and throwing one arm
forward with full force, he quietly sank
to death. Neu was taken in an ambu
lance to the California Hospital by a
doctor who had been summoned. A
hurried examination was made, life be
ing found extinct. The remains were
taken to the C. D. Howry undertaking
parlors by the Coroner, who will hold
an inquest to-morrow.
Foreman Anunsen's legs were badly
sprained. Aside from minor bruises and
scratches, the other occupants were un- j
injured.
Neu came here early ln January I
from Chicago to take personal charge j
of the work of constructing the San
Pedro harbor breakwater, the contract
for which. had been awarded to his firm |
for nearly $2,000,000 by the Government, j
The firm has spent up to date $300,000 !
and had just begun the construction of
barges to hurry the work.
The body will be shipped to Chicago. j

Dr. "W. S. Rice of 418 S. Main St., Adams, N.

the most difficult ruptures of long standing. He
does this without causing the patient one bit of

method and treatment direct to the sufferer's
home, where It can be easily used without assis-
tance and brings immediate comfort and relief
It requires from tÂ».ree to ten weeks for the
ruptured opening to heal, at the end of which
time the patient can pitch hay. lift a barrel of
flour, plow ln the fields, or do any kind of hard
work without any danger of the rupture coming
back. Dr. Rice has cured hundreds of old men
who had been ruptured 30 and 40 years.
They write him letters that a few years ago
could not have been possible since never before
has there beeh a certain cure for rupture. N E
Smith of Mound City Kan., ls one of the men
whom Dr. Rice has restored to perfect health
Mr. Smith says: "Although pretty well alone
in years and with an old rupture that might
have ended my days at any time I am Just as
glad to be cured as though I had my life to live
over again. I was a little bit doubtful about
Dr. Rice's claims. I have seen so many fall
ures of trusses and treatments that while the
plan looked wonderful I had my doubts He
cured me all right, and I am willing to believe
that he will any one. I don't care how bad
off they are." It will pay any ruptured man
or woman or the parents of a ruptured t*nS

BEE IN OPEN COURT
THEY held a cute little cooking bee in Judge Murasky's court yester
day. True, they didn't cook doughnuts or endeavor to get the Bos
ton twang on chili beans, hut they boiled potatoes until the bailiff
fainted. The Storey Packing Company is at present endeavoring
to collect a balance of $2100 on a mess of 35,000 pounds of desiccated,
granulated, desiccated granulated and granulated desiccated potatoes sold
the Alaska Exploration Company for the sustenance of its explorers as they
plod their way o'er the trackless plains of the frozen north. "When the case
was called plaintiff's and defendant's representatives alike filed into court
carrying bottles and cans of the abused potatoes. The defendant claimed
that a portion of the contracted-for potatoes were Inferior to the samples
seen. Then the experts were called.
To be a potato expert is to occupy a position but little Inferior to the
gods. Your association with potatoes In various stages of growth and prep
aration must be much more intimate than one cares to become with his
mother-in-law, and you must care much more for the food of Ireland than you
do for your legal parent before your judgment will be taken in a court of
justice. The first expert called did not satisfactorily pass the examination
to entitle him to bear the honorable name of potato expert, still he
was allowed to eat a quantity of the raw material from cans and boxes. As
he pretended to enjoy the ground spuds the witness stated that he could tell no
difference between the samples and the cans offered for sale. He was ex
cused, and a genuine potato expert took the stand. He was a Joy forever,
and his manly form was devoured by the envious eyes of the assembled
multitude. He wasn't an animal, he said, and he demanded that the samples
be cooked. DicK Welch, clerk of the court, appointed himself chef, and after
looking up a coal oil stove soon had a pot boiling and simmering merrily
away. His work done, all hands had some potatoes. The first batch was
quite palatable, and then sample number two was put in the kettle. It was
cooked to a finish, and then tne defendant's representatives found fault with
the taste. "It isn't cooked right," said one of the plaintiff's crowd, and then
Welch kicked. His cooking was all right, he contended, and something must
be wrong with the spuds. Another batch was prepared, but the noses of de
fendant's supporters turned toward the heavens. There was more muttering
from the other side about bad cooking, and "Welch threw up his job.
This caused an argument, during which the coal oil stove nearly succeeded
in blowing up, and quite succeeded in causing an adjournment until to-mor
row. More spuds will be cooked, but Welch has quit. His reputation Is at
stake, and he will never cook anything the quality of which is a bone of
contention and bitter litigation. 1
WORLD'S FAIR
ASSURED FOR

Name Adopted for the
Enterprise.
OUTLINE OF ORGANIZATION
:
PERMANENT OFFICERS TO BE
ELECTED TUESDAY.
Exposition to Be Opened on May 1,
1901, and to Be Continued for
at Least Six
Months.
San Francisco Is to have a world's
fair in 1901. It is to be known as the
Pacific Ocean and International Expo
sition. This much was made certain
by the action yesterday of the general
committee having this project in view.
There were present at the meeting,
.which was held in the rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce, about sixty
members of the committee of one hun
dred. At the last session of the com
mittee Chairman J. B. Reinstein was
authorized to appoint a committee on
permanent organization, with instruc
tions to report of February 4. The~com
mlttee comprised the following gentle
men: George A. New hall, J. B. Rein
stein, Mayor Phelan, Henry J. Crocker
and C. E. Grunsky. Its report was sub
mitted yesterday, and, after some
minor amendments, was adopted. The
report as adopted is as follows:
Your committee recommends that the
officers of the exposition be also the
permanent officers of the general com
mit- ,
Thai the officers of the exposition be
as foilows: President, first vice presl
â¢ dent, second vice president, secretary,
treasurer, audit) and director general.

tion affairs be entrusted to a board of
directors. ,'â 'â¢â â  .
That the board -of directors- consist
of the officers of the exposition (except
the director general) and of the chair
men of the nine standing committees.
That the director general, who shall
be appointed by the board of directors,
shall be the executive officer and act
ive manager of the exposition, with
such duties and powers as may be pre
scribed by the board of directors.
That standing committees be named
as follows: Finance, grounds and
buildings, legislation, publicity and
promotion. State- exhibits, national ex
hibit^, foreign exhibits, transportation,
concession of privileges, and that the
board of directors have the power
from time to time to appoint such
special committees as the board of
directors may deem necessary.
That the exposition is to be chiefly
an industrial and commercial exposi
tion, and that it should be endeavored
by the board of directors to make
some of its industrial features perma
nent.
That the exposition be known as the
Pacific Ocean and - International Ex
position, and that it be held in San
Francisco in 1901, for at least six
months, commencing May 1.
The only point over which there was
any extended argument was the name
for the enterprise. More than an hour
was consumed in deciding upon it. Sev
eral attempts were made to defer ac
tion on the matter, but the need of
expedition and energy under the cir
cumstances finally led to the settle
ment of the baptismal question.
Following the adoption of the report,
J. A. Filcher moved that the permanent
officers be elected at the next meeting
of the committee. This was adopted.
Supervisor Lackmann presented two
bills which the Legislature will be
asked to pass. One provides for giving
power to counties, cities and counties
and municipalities tip appropriate
moneys for the proposed exposition,
and the other empowers the Governor
to appoint nine commissioners for the
exposition, who shall serve without
compensation; but who shall have their
traveling expenses paid. They were
made a special order to be considered
immediately after the election of per
manent officers. -VSBBSBBn
Charles R. Patton's motion authoriz
ing the permanent chairman of the or

It is also especially desirable for

NO INCREASE
FOR' FIREMEN
OR POLICEMEN
Decision of the Su
preme Court.
SALARY ACTS ARE ILLEGAL
â x
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SAVED
TO THE TREASURY.
State Legislature 'Has No Right to
Interfere in the Affairs of
Charter Municipali
' ties.
The Supreme Court in bank yesterday
declared unconstitutional the two acts of
the Legislature of 1897, by which the exec
utive officers of the Police. and : Fire De
partments would have their salaries in
creased."; The^ total of. the proposed in
crease amounted to $5000 per month, or
$60,000 -a year- , -- y*-'-: ; :;' â¢--â *.' - *.
Max Popper be^an an action, in the Su
perior Court to prevent this money being
expended, claiming that the acts under
which the money was to be paid were un
constitutional. The Superior Court decid
ed against him, but yesterday's decision
was in his favor, and in that of the tax
payers of this city.
At the session of the Legislature in
1597 an act was passed and approved
March 8, to regulate and fix the salaries
of certain officers of the Police Depart
ment in cities of the first-class as follows:
Chief of Police, $5000 per annum; captain
of detectives, $3000; six captains of police,
$2500 each; clerk to the Chief of Police
and Board of Police Commissioners, $2500;
property clerk, $2500; fifteen detectives,
$1800 each. All of the salaries thus pro
vided for were to be paid out of the City
Treasury the same as before the passage
of the act. .
A similar act relating to the Fire De
partment was passed about the same
time, and for municipalities of the flrst
class provided for the payment of certain
officers as follows: Cnief engineer, $5000
per annum; assistant chief engineer, $i 000;
secretary or clerk, $3000; assistant engi
neers, {2100 each; veterinary surgeon,
$1800. These salaries were also to be paid
in their usual manner as before the pass
age of the act. Â , ...
Max Popper became interested in this
proposed expenditure of the peoples
money and sent a communication to Au
ditor Broderick asking that official if he
intended to audit the salaries of the po
lice and fire officials upon the basis of
the increase. The Auditor answered that
the Governor had carefully considered
the bills before signing them and had de
clared that he believed they were consti
tutional. Unless enjoined by legal pro
cess Mr. Broderick asserted he would act
according to the statutes.
Popper at once applied to the courts for
relief for the people, asking that the Au
ditor be enjoined from auditing the de
mands according to the increased rate.
lie asserted in his complaint that all that
the officials mentioned, were entitled to
was specified in the preceding acts of
1897 which specified that the salaries
should be as follows: President of the
Board of Police Commissioners, $250 per
month; Police Commissioners, $100; Chief
of Police, $1000 per annum; captain of po
lice, $125 per month; clerk to the Chief
and Commissioners,- $125; chief engineer
of the Fire Department, $250 per month;
assistant chief engineer, $250; assistant
engineers, $150; clerk, $150; veterinary sur
geon, $60. . . /
To Popper's complaint a demurrer was
entered. The defendants took the posi
tion that the Legislature had the right to
regulate such matters. Popper's position
was that the Legislature had no right to
Interfere in the affairs of municipalities
governed and operated under a charter.
Superior Judge Seawell sustained the de
murrer, which was at that time believed
to be the death-blow to the contest, no
one anticipating that Popper would take
the matter any further. However, he felt
sure that his position was right and ap
pealed to the Supreme Court from the
Judgment and order sustaining the de
murrer. That he/ was in the right is
shown by the decision rendered yester
day, which was written by Justice Van
Dyke and concurred in by Justices Hen
shaw, Temple, Harrison and Chief Justice
Beatty. The part which declares uncon
stitutional the acts of the Legislature in
interfering in municipal affairs of a city
having a charter is as follows:
Does the salary or pay of policemen and fire
men belong to "municipal affairs?" If so,
then these acts of the Legislature attempting
to raise and fix such salaries have no more
j force in the city and county of Bar; Francisco
than the act of the same session requiring the
signature of the Mayor to ordinances and reso
lutions; and ln Morton vs. Broderick lt was
held that such act had no binding force ln
said city and county, for the reason that lt
concerned municipal affairs and therefore fell
within the prohibition against such legislation.
The government of the city and county of San
Francisco may be said to be dual in its na
ture, and in Kahn vs. Sutro. 114 Cat, 316, this
court distinguished and classified officers that
were county and officers that were municipal;
and the officers of the Police and Fire depart
ments are designated as particularly and dis
tinctively municipal officers. It may be taken
as a "matter of law that the people adopting
the constitutional amendment under considera
tion at the election of 1896 'did so in view of
this definition of municipal affairs, as distin
guished from county affairs, so decided in that
case. â¢ The purpose of the amendment ls ap
parent.. It was to prevent the constant tam
pering .'with matters which concern only or
chiefly the municipality under the guise of laws
general in form. "The fundamental purpose
In construing a constitutional provision Is to
ascertain and give effect to the Intent of the
people in adopting it." â¢ â¢ â¢ We are of the
opinion that the pay of firemen and policemen
clearly falls within the term municipal af
fairs. " Judgment reversed, with directions to
the court below to overrule the demurrer to
the complaint.
Back of all these legal features there
is a little inside history to this case. This
was published In The Call on the 18th of
last July. It was after the demurrer nad
been sustained by Judge Seawell and .the
case was on appeal to the Supreme Court
that the high officials of the Police De
partment became apprehensive that the
chance of their getting their hands into
the public treasury a little deeper was
getting somewhat dubious. The capes of
Kahn vs. Sutro and Morton vs. Broder
ick had been decided by ; the Supreme
Court and the meddling of legislator.-*
with the municipal affairs of cities hav
ing charters was shown to be unconstitu
tional.
-Fearing that the anpeal would win tne
heads of the Police Department sent De
tective Bee. now deceased, to see Max
Popper to Induce the. latter to have the
appeal dismissed. Of this particular In
terview with Bee Mr. Popper said: "The
pros and cons of the matter were laid be
fore me by that gentleman and I was
flatly asked if I would withdraw the suit
and not let it go to a final decision. He
did not give: any reason or explain him
self . irl-v any respect, but simply asked me
if I would do the department that favor."
Mr. Popper did not give a direct an
swer, but asked the advice of his attor
ney who counseled him to stand on his
appeal, as the point at issue involved the
vital question of home rule for San Fran
cisco. __________-_-_-_-__-_-.

GOVERNOR GAGE
WINS AT THE RACES
Police Commissioner Gunst and Barney
Schreiber Show the Executive
the Potency of "Good
Judgment"
GOVERNOR GAGE won his first bet at the races yesterday, and Mose
Gunst ls put to the necessity of knocking another card or two f?bm his
nickel-ln-the-slot machines to make good the loss of ten big cart
wheels. It was not due to lack of Judgment that the Police Commis
sioner lost the ten, but to a laudable desire to "jolly" the executive,
who may shortly be compelled to pass upon certain anti-racetrack bins
that are likely to come before the Legislature. So well pleased was Mose
with his investment that for once he did not complain over having had the
losing end of a gambling proposition.
Governor Gage attended the races yesterday, chaperoned by Gunst. Tho
Police Commissioner thought it would be a capital Idea to convince the Los
Angeleno that racing really was
not .as bad as lt was painted,
and, knowing that one always re
gards with favor a game that he
can beat, he evolved the idea that
it might not a bad plan to let the
Governor win a bet or two. To
make sure that the scheme would
not miscarry, and that the Czar
of the State Capitol would be
made to realize that racing as
conducted at Oakland ls honest,
and that picking winners is only
a matter of judgment, Mose
waited until there came a race
wherein the favorite seemingly
did not have a chance to lose. It
was the fifth, in which Fred Fos
ter's sprinter Abuse was pitted
against an ordinary field, and
was a 1 to 3 chance in the bet
ting. Peixotto seemed to be as
good a thing for the place, and
was quoted at odds-on.
. Mose sought out Barney Schrei
ber's stand in the betting ring.
"Give me a ticket at even
money on Peixotto to show, and
I'll pay you the difference," he
said to the Dutchman. "It's for
the Governor, and I want to give
him a 'live one'," he added. j^Hj â  ,v, , Â ,- _ _
"Veil," said Barney, swelling with generosity. "If its for Mr. Getch, vy
don't you give him a ticket on Abuse a blace? I'll lay you efen money.
The ticket was made out as the bookmaker suggested, Gunst volunteer
ing to reimburse the bookmaker, and the Police Commissioner noncha
lantly sauntered to the judges' stand, from the upper story of which Mr.
Gage was watching the horses journeying to the post.
Spectators who were eying' the party in the stand saw a pantomime that
â¢ proved to be more interesting to them than was the race itself. Mose noti
fied the Los Angeieno that he had
â¢placed a bet for him. Instantly
the Governor was all excitement,
and, delving into a pocket he pro
duced a pair of eyeglasses and
proceeded to fit them to the exec
utive nose, while the Police Com
missioner pointed out on the pro
gramme the name of the animal
which in his Judgment had a pos
sible chance to run second. Soon
the horses were off, and Abuse
cantered home a half-dozen
lengths ahead of his field, Mr.
Gage with difficulty restraining
a desire to forget the dignity
looked for in a Governor and yell:
"Come on you Abuse! Bring him
along, Cash! Abuse! Abuse!" and
sundry other advice calculated to
Inspire courage in horse and rider.
Then the spectators saw Mose
dig down into a pocket and bring
forth the Abuse ticket, which he
presented to the Governor. The
latter scowled slightly, and It-was
thought for a moment by those
outside the stand that -Mose; had
given him a "phony" ticket on
some losing horse and was reserv
ing the winning, pasteboard to
cash for himself, at the expense of the German bookmaker. Later it was
learned, however, that the Governor was displeased because, the wager had
not been placed on Abuse "straight" .'at 'ten or fifteen to one.
But the State's executive has been shown that the racing game Is sim
ply one that requires judgment, and Mose expects that $10 to go a lone way
when the jockey club has need of the Los Angeles man's good will.
SEAWELL HOLDS
ISLAIS TITLES
GOOD AND VALID
decides in Favor of
Defendants.
OTHERS MUST MAKE ANSWER
COURT QUIETS TITLE IN GIVING
JUDGMENT.
The Action Defeats All. Purposes of
the Suit Instigated, Which
Will Probably Be Dis
"" missed.
One by one. with exasperating regu
larity for the plaintiff, the suits recently
instituted by the Islais and Salinas Water
Company to obtain possession of various
parcels of land located in the boundaries
of the old Rancho Rincon de las Salinas,
or Bernal Rancho, are being decided by-
Judge Seawell, and in each instance the
plaintiff company, which is believed to
be a mythical corporation, is defeated.
Yesterday Judge Seawell ordered judg
ments entered in favor of Defendants G.
B. Gillman, Fred E. Magee, Walter Ma
gee, Savings and Loan ' Society, F. C.
Siebe and Max Goldberg. Judge Sea
well, ;in entering judgment, ordered all
claims of title to defendants' lands, other
than defendants' claims, be quieted, thus
giving defendants clear titles to the lands
in recent litigation.
The land which the Islais and Salinas
Water Company claims lies along the old
San Jose road, and was years ago granted
by the old Mexican Governor. Subse
quently it became the property of Joseph
Mora Moss, ' Harvey S. Brown, Francois
L. A. Pioche, Henry A. Cobb and John
F. Cobb. On October 30, 1860, the land
was purchased by the Islais and Salinas
Water Company, a corporation formed to
purchase It. It was divided into building
lots and disposed of. The Islais and Sa
linas Water Company, since the transfer,
seems to have dissolved, but, neverthe
less, the . suits to recover the property
from the various present holders have
been instituted in its name.
The motive which prompted the insti
gation of the various suits is a ques
tionable one. In any event up to date the
claims of the plaintiff corporation â¢ have
been found based simply on nerve. The
original record of the rim sale by the
company to the present holders is. dated
January 2, 1861, and sets forth that cer
tain J lands were sold to . Henry . B. Porter
and Abel -Wade. . The deed bears the sig
nature of the company by _F. L. A. â  Pio
che, H. A. Cobb and C. de Boom, trus
tees. As there was no common seal of the
company, and as no records exist; show
ing that the "trustees" named l were au
thorized - to dispose of the land, .an â¢ op
portunity for lawsuits presented itself and
the industrious Islais and Salinas Â£ Water
Company apparently rope -to the occa
sion and, notwithstanding that the deeds
have stood undisputed for over a * quar
ter of a century, suits were commenced.
The opportunity for profits by appealing
to the courts probably was born when a
recent suit affecting a plat of land in the
Bernal district was decided.
One of the deeds issued by the company
came into the hands of Mary Barney. She
found her lot already in the possesion of
John Pforr. She- entered suit for posses
sion in the Superior Court, but lost, the
court hold that, for various reasons, the
title from the three trustees was not
valid. The case was carried to the Su
preme Court, which upheld the decision of
the lower* court. â¢
This was the beginning of the suit,
which is simply a suit against all who
hold deeds signed by the three trustees,
instituted by two unknown parties, who
claim to be the two survivors of the old
corporation. They claim that there is no
official record of the three trustees who
signed the original deeds, that, according
to- the Barney-Pforr decision, the deeds
are valueless, and accordingly sue for the
property. It is stated that the complain
ants In the case have agreed to settle up
and give a clear title to any defendant
who will pay them 2 per cent of the pres
ent assessed valuation of their property
and state that some have already paid up.
Others look upon It as a scheme, and are
determined to fight the case to a finish.
Amonp these is M. Salomon. He placed
his individual case in an attorney's hands,
but the attorney finds himself at sea to
a certain extent.
He characterizes the whole thing as a
scheme, and, owing to the peculiar atti
tude of the plaintiffs, will find it difficult
to bring his client out on top. "The plain
tiffs," he says, "have told us that if we
file an answer they will immediately dis
miss the case. We can have it dismissed
readily ourselves, in fact, by pleading the
statute of limitations: but this is not what
we want. If we make any such plea the
prosecution will move for the dismissal
of the case and the titles of the land will
forever remain under a cloud."
As Judge Seawell has quieted title as to
the holdings of all defendants who filed
answers to the action, all purposes of the
action have been defeated, and without
doubt the suit will be dismissed in the
not far distant future.
Bobbed by a Woman.
D. C. Webster, a recent arrival from
Alaska, last night caused the arrest of a
woman, who is known as Dottie Chris
tiansen, on a charge of grand larceny.
He claims that he met her Friday night
and that she robbed him of $15 while they
were drinking in a saloon on Jackson
street and Montgomery avenue. â¢

CARPENTERS EMPLOYED
AS BRICKLAYERS
MORE CROOKED WORK ON THE
HALL OF JUSTICE.
Investigataion of the Building- Begun
by the Building Committee of
the Supervisors.
Since the time that the first stone was
placed in the foundation of the Hall of
Justice there has been nothing but fraud
and flagrant violations of the stipulations
of the original contract for the erection
of the building. The latest outrage that
is being perpetrated upon the public is
the laying of the terra-cotta stone, both
in the Interior and exterior of the tower,
by carpenters instead of by experienced
masons. The work is being done in a
slipshod manner and wltnout the least
method. This work has been going on
for over a week, and Bateman Bros, seem
satisfied with their new scheme of econ
omy, as they have to pay the carpenters
but $Â£ to $2 50 a day, where they hereto
fore were compelled to pay bricklayers
$4 for the same work.
The outrageous violation of the trust
imposed by the public in the contractors
has at last been taken cognizance of by
the Building Committee of the Board of
Supervisors. A secret investigation has
been instituted by Supervisor Holland, the
chairman of the committee, and is now in
progress. It is understood that every ef
fort will be made to compel Bateman
Bros, to adhere to the original contract
let to them for the construction of the
building by compelling them to recon
struct, the defective walls that are now
being erected. H-BBBBK_Wb T *_|
The excuse Bateman Bros, gave to the
discharged bricklayers a week ago was
that they were non-union men and unfit
for the work for which they were em
ployed. This accusation,' however, is de
nied by the discharged men, who can
show the necessary papers in proof that
what their employer says is untrue. In
fact, one of the men, George . O'Connor,
is the treasurer of the most prominent
union In the city.
ILLICIT STILLS CAPTURED.
Revenue Agents Secure Two Plants
in Sarta Clara County.
The revenue ."gents are after owners of
illicit stills and succeeded in unearthing
two in Santa Ci'ara County yesterday.
The first was found on the ranch of
Charles Newman, six miles from San Jose,
and near Capartina. The still was of
fifty gallons capacity and was used for
the making of both grape and prune
brandy. , . â¢ _
The second was on the ranch of Joseph
Weis. - It was of the same capacity as
the first one. A large stock' of brandy
was found, being hidden all over the
place.
The discoveries were made by B. M.
Thomas, special revenue agent, assisted
by D. J. Flannery, Deputy Collector.
They seized both plants and took the
stills and other articles to San Jose,
where they were stored in the special
bonded warehouse. Warrants will be
served on the distillers Monday. .
BALD AND SLOAN TO DEPART
Capitalist and Jockey Will Start for
Europe on. . Thursday.
Eddie Bald, that quiet and retiring
young fellow who for short distances Is
about the ' fastest man that ever sat
astride a wheel, leaves in a few days for
Paris, where he will begin to get into a
condition for, the annual races that are
held in France. Eddie. merely drifted out
to California for rest and fun, and he has
had it. He leaves for New York on
Thursday, accompanied by Tod Sloan and
Charley Dwyer, the friend of the latter.
Tod has to get back to dear old London,
"don't cher Know ,'.', for he is under con
tract to ride in England again this sea
son for the nobility. This trio will shake
oft the dust of California from their pat
ent leathers on Thursday night, but the
parting is made bearable to their many
friends and admirers by the thought that
they will say au revoir, and not farewell.

A HOME TALK.
Our plan is to sell you a home for the same
monthly payments that you are now wasting
In rent. Yes, wasting, for you get no re-
turns. You are continually paying out and
nothing to show for it. We will give you a
4-room and bath cottage for a small payment
down and $20 or $25 per month, which averages
you $6 40 per month Interest or rent. The bal-
ance of $18 every month goes toward the pay-
ment of your home instead of to the landlord.
The Heyman Tract is one of the finest resi-
dence locations In the city. Castro and 22d sts.,
close to the tract. Streets graded and sewered.

CREDITORS
MOURN HIS
DEPARTURE
Mannie Clayburg Has
Left Suddenly.
WINE, WOMEN AND SONG
HABITUES OP THE TENDERLOIN
LOSE A "GOOD THING."
"Gay" Monroe, a Transient Butterfly,
Said to Be at the Bottom of
the Butcher's Disap
pearance.
The gilded paths of the tenderloin have
claimed another victim. E. P. Clayburg,
club man, good fellow and Junior mem
ber of the wholesale butcher firm of Clay
burg Bros. & George, after a few years
of gay life along the cocktail route, has
finally become invplved in difficulties
which caused him to leave town suddenly.
His unexpected departure is mourned by
a host of creditors, but it Is claimed by
his family and intimate friends that his
financial difficulties played no part in his
sudden leave-taking.
Young Clayburg left the city last Sat
urday night and went direct to Sacramen
to, where it ls said he was met. by "Gay"
Monroe, an exceptionally beautiful wom
an, who boasts of more than several years
of butterfly existence on the tenderloin.
"Mannie" Clayburg, as he was
familiarly called by the habitues of tho
tenderloin, on whom he lavished his
money, met the woman in this city ln a
Powell-street cafe about two months ago
and became infatuated with her. They
went driving together, enjoyed wine sup
pers, and in short cut a swath on the line
as wide as Market street. Another woman,
a friend of the young butcher, who occu
pies a swell flat on Jones street, heard of
her lover's escapades with the Monroe
woman, and she is said to have made ugly
threats of reprisals if the intimacy was
not discontinued. "Mannie's" intimate
friends assert that he desired to rid him
self of the Jones-street woman, and for
that reason he left town.
This solution, however, does not account
for the many debts Clayburg left behind,
most of which were incurred at the poker
table, and other pastimes which part
wealthy young bloods from their money.
The young man's father denies abso
lutely that "Mannie's" sudden departure
was caused by any financial difficulties
which he may have had with the firm.
In fact. Mr. Clayburg Sr. asserts that his
son still has money to his credit on the
books of the firm.
Clayburg was known on the tenderloin
; as both a good fellow and a "good thing."
' On the Monroe woman he lavished money
and jewelry, much to the discomfiture of
, other women who claimed "Mannie" as
. their own private property.
"My son is no longer a member of the
firm," said Moses Clayburg, the young
man's father, when seen at his home, 1810
] Bush street, last night. "It ls true that
he left town rather suddenly, but he does
not owe the firm a dollar. I understand
: that he owes several little debts down
town, which if presented to me will be
paid; that is, of course, if they are legiti
mate debts. I will not liquidate any of
Imy son's gambling debts. I don't know
I where he has gone, and I have not heard
!of him since ne left. Several persons have
j informed me that my son took with him
; money belonging to the firm. Now, that
is all nonsense. Mannie does not owe us
i a penny." ____________________
GAINES' AMENDMENT
IS RECONSIDERED
INTERIOR CYCLERS CANNOT
RACE FOR CITY CLUBS.
The regular meeting of the California
Cycling Clubs held last night in the Par
rott building was largely attended. Every
club belonging to the body was represent
ed by its delegate.
The cause of the big meeting was the in
terest taken in certain legislation brought
before the January meeting, which has
been termed the "Games amendment,"
providing that any member of the asso
ciation may ride in interclub races
whether he be a resident of the city
whence his club hails or not.
The kernel of the question is this:
"Whether or not a rider living in an out
side town can ride for a San Francisco
club. The law was passed at the last
meeting, and a motion for reconsideration
came up last night. The adherents of the
law urged that a man should be permitted
to ride for any club he pleased. The op
ponents argued that that discouraged the
organization of clubs in small interior
towns; that any good rider developed in
an outside town should ride only for the
club existing in his locality.
The debate on the question was long
and heated. The light for the reconsid
eration of the amendment was led by
Charles Albert Adams, followed by J. A.
Woodson of Sacramento and T. G. Spil
lane.
The opposition forces opened with Judge
Frank H. Kerrigan, followed by Dr.
Thomas L. Hill and Percy N. Long.
When the question was finally voted on,
the motion to reconsider was carried by
16 to 11. The amendment itself was then
voted upon, and was lost by the same
vote. : . *.
Under the rules as they now stand, a
man must be a resident of the city in
which his club is located 60 days before
any lnterclub race.
A motion to require every man riding
in any event sanctioned by the association
to belong to the body Itself, whether a
club member or not, was voted on and
carried by a vote of 17 to 8.
Mr. Woodson of Sacramento proposed
that at the March meeting the delegates
discuss whether it would not be better to
have the association composed only of
individual members and no clubs.
The resignations of the Olympic Cyclers
and California Cycling Club were read
and accepted.
Chairman W. L. Loos of the racing
board reported that at the coming indoor
tournament a trophy race would be rid
den, for a valuable cup to be known as
the Bushnell Trophy. He stated that the
following rules had been laid down for
the event:
1. The same shall be an unpaced amateur
two-mile pursuit race, contesting teams to start
at opposite sides of the track.
2 A team shall consist of two riders from
each club competing.
3. Two clubs only shall compete at one time.
4. The first man finishing in each race shall
be declared winner, and his team shall count
one point.
5. Each team shall compete with every other
team once only, except In case of a tie between
the clubs having the largest number of points
nt close of contest. When an extra race shall
be run to decide said tie, the winning team of
said heat shall be entitled to the trophy.
6. Should more than two clubs be tie on points
each club may select a rider to represent it
in a scratch final. /
7. In case of any rider becoming disabled in
such a manner that he cannot compete, his club
may select a substitute.
Any other rule necessary shall be hereafter
annexed by the track racing committee.
The following clubs were represented at
the meeting:

CORDELIA BOTKIN HEARS
HER DOOM PRONOUNCED
Sentenced to Life Imprisonment by Judge â No
tice of Appeal Is Given â Condemned
Woman's Counsel Are Still
Confident.
JUDGMENT has been pronounced against Cordelia Botkln. Yesterday
morning this monstrous criminal, condemned by a Jury to a life of
penal servitude, stood before Judge Cook and with voice trembling
fear, protested her innocence. "I should not be sentenced for
this cruel crime," she said, "because I am innocent of its commission."
She then took her seat. "Stand up, please," said Judge Cook, and the
weary, nervous woman, supported by her sister, Miss Dora Brown, again
rose to her feet. The Indictment was read and the facts of the trial and
conviction cited. Then ln a low tone Judge Cook said: "It Is the judg
ment of this court that you be taken to the State Prison at San Quentin
and confined therein for the term of your natural life." Judgment had
been pronounced and with lt hope seemed to desert the condemned woman.
Still she was strengthened by the memory of her lawyer's words when he
closed his last plea in her behalf: "If this court decides that we are wrong
in our contention that this court has no jurisdiction we will not be dis
mayed, but will take our exception and with lt go to the court of last re
sort, where we have no fear of consequences."
"When Mrs. Botkin's case was called by Judge Cook at the opening of
thÂ© morning session Mrs. Botkln expected that the passing hour would see
her on the road to freedom, but she was in error. Her counsel rose and
made a formal motion for a new trial. A similar motion had been argued
the preceding week, the court had prepared his decision and it was against
the prisoner. Judge Cook took up the manuscript and read it in its en
tirety. In part it reads:
The only question presented on the argument of the motion for a new trial
herein was the question as to whether this court had jurisdiction to try the de
fendant for the crime charged ln the indictment. All other questions included
ln the written motion for a now trial were passed and submitted without argu
ment, and no affidavits were presented in support of such grounds as were based
on affidavits.
The question of Jurisdiction was not raised on the arraignment of the de
fendant either by demurrer or otherwise, neither was it raised at any time
during the course of the trial, either by objections to evidence offered or in the
instructions requested by the defendant, or at all.
Now for the first time since the filing of the Indictment herein the Jurisdic
tion of the court to try the cause is questioned, and in questioning the same the
court ls asked by defendant's counsel to say in one and the same breath that it
has no Jurisdiction to try the cause, but nevertheless will order the same re
tried.
The Supreme Court has held that "a motion for a new trial presupposes a
sufficient valid indictment upon which, with sufficient legal evidence in support
of its allegations, a legal verdict and a valid, binding judgment may be pro
nounced. The statute does not contemplate or authorize a retrial upon an in
sufficient or invalid indictment; hence a motion for a new trial cannot properly
be based upon any objection to the sufficiency or validity of the indictment, or
any errors or irregularities occurring in the proceedings before issue of fact
Joined by plea to a good, and sufficient indictment, the- object and purpose of
a retrial being simply to enable the trial court to avoid the errors and irregu
larities claimed to have occurred on the former trial to the prejudice of the
rights secured to the defendant."
Section 1181 of the Penal Code enumerates specifically the grounds upon
which a motion for a new trial may be granted, and "want of jurisdiction* is
not one of them.
"There being no other grounds upon which a new trial can be granted. It
necessarily follows that unless some other reason than an alleged want of jur
isdiction exists the motion made must bo denied, and as no other reasons have
been called to the attention of the court and the court is satisfied that the evi
dence given at the trial is sufficient to sustain the verdict rendered, the motion
for a new trial is denied."
. An exception was taken to the court's order and without delay Attor
ney McGowan, who, with Attorney Heggerty, represented the prisoner, made
a formal motion for an arrest of judgment. Such a motionâ its purpose be
ing to attack the jurisdiction of the courtâ was anticipated by Judge
Cook and a decision denying the motion was read. Stripped of its legal
verbiage and citations the decision reads:
The indictment in this case charges a murder perpetrated by means of poison,
not by personal violence. On the face of the indictment it appears that the poi
son was prepared in this city and county and, so far as the defendant could
personally administer it. was delivered and administered here, ail with the willful
and malicious intent to kill. The deceased, however, was not here in person at
the time of such delivery and administering of the poison, but subsequently par
took of the same and in consequence died. Her death and the actual swallowing
of the poison by her occurred in the State of Delaware. Defendant contends
that no murder was committed here, and consequently that there ls no Jurisdic
tion in this court to try the cause.
After the poison had been deposited where defendant deposited lt with the
Intent to murder and to have deceased manually take the poison and eat thereof,
had the deceased come to San Francisco and from such place taken possession
of it, returned to Delaware and there partaken of the same and died, would this
be the contention, or would defendant so contend had the poison been delivered
Into the hands of deceased or placed within her reach (with the intent that she
should partake of the same and thereby die), and thereafter deceased should
have taken it with her into another State, there partaken of It and died?
In either of such cases there would have occurred within this Jurisdiction the
two main elements of the crime of murderâ the act, so far as the defendant could
net, and the intent would have united, and all within this Jurisdiction. In a poi
soning case, where the deceased received, ate and died all in the Immediate
presence of a defendant and within the confines of a room, the defendant would
be guilty of murder if he handed to the deceased the poison, having at the time
he so handed it the intent to kill; no further act would be required of him. That
the deceased with his own hand conveyed the poison to his mouth would not
lessen the defendant's' crime. The law would not require the prosecution, in
such a ease, to prove that the defendant not only delivered and handed the poison
to the deceased but also that he by his own hand poured lt down the throat of
the deceased.
Suppose this case: Jones, in a kitchen, believing that Brown is dining alone
in an adloining room, and intending to kill Brown, places poison ln food sent from
the kitchen and placed before Brown at the table where he sits. Unknown to
Jones, a guest against whom Jones has no evil Intentions is dining with Brown.
Both Brown and bis guest partake of the poisoned food and as a result die. Jones
has not left his kitchen. He did not place the food to the mouth of either.
His act consisted merely in placing, with the intent to kill, poison within the
reach of one of them. Their eating and their death were but the consequences
of his act, which was coupled with an Intent to kill. Could it be claimed that
Jones was not guilty of the complete, crime of murder and that, too, regardless
of whether Brown, his guest, or both of them died?
As further examples of my meaning:
A willfully and with Intent to kill mixes poison ln a flask of liquor and hands
it to B. who, by his own hand, places it to his lips and dies. This is murder.
The act of A was but the delivery. It was the act of B himself that actually
produced the result. Yet, the act of A made it possible for Bto partake. The
act of B, as well as his death, were but the consequences of the act of A. The
act of A having been coupled with the intent to kill constituted the complete
crime of murderâ what followed was hut the consequence.
If these thoughts be logical, it would hardly seem necessary to consider any
of the many subtle arguments and supposed precedents which have been
pressed on the court's attention by counsel on the motion in arrest of judgment
as well as on the motion for a new trial, argued herein. All of the murderous
acts which the defendant (in this or any case) could herself commit, were com
mitted in San Francisco, and with the intent to kill existing here at the time of
the commission of such acts, all else is but the sequence to such acts. Every one
is presumed to intend the ordinary consequences of his acts and is unquestionably
responsible therefor. Murder by violence, as by a blow, or a bullet, and mur
der by poison are clearly distinguishable. In the first personal contact and an
act by the hand of the accused is required to accomplish the crime, while tn the
latter it is the act of the deceased that operates as the immediate cause of
death; the act of the accused Is complete when he has made it possible for the
deceased to do that which produces the result which he intended by, and to fol
low, his act.
The case is, therefore, distinguishable from the Hall case, which was a killing
by violence and the long line of cases which hold that the place where the blow
Is lnficted or the poison administered is the locus of the crime, would seem to
support the jurisdiction of this court. 'â /â _ y\ y
It would seem, therefore, that it is unnecessary to attempt an interpreta
tion of section 27 of tho Penal Code. F mierpreta
It is claimed by the District Attorney that If Jurisdiction, does not attach
by reason of the facts themselves, lt does attach by reason of sections 27 655
and 656 of the Penal Code, when read together, giving them the liberal con
truction required tÂ»y section 4of the same code. It is claimed that such sec
tions mean simply that all crimes created by the laws of this State which are in
part committed by persons within this State, may be prosecuted under out.
laws.
- . .
ThÂ© defendant claims that section 27 does not create a crime, but merely pro
vides for the punishment of crimes created by other statutes, and that Jurisdic
tion can only be found in the chapter of the code relating to Jurisdiction.
The Supreme Court of this State has held In the case of People vs. McNulty
(98 Cal., 438-9) that a statute referring exclusively to laws creating a crime In
cluded a statute provided for punishment only.
In a very recent case (People vs. Black, 16 Cal., Dec. 88) the Supreme Court
also held that in looking for statutes conferring jurisdiction other sections of
the code than those found in the chapter relating to the subject of jurisdiction
could be invoked, and that although Jurisdiction could not be found in a certain
case under that part of the code devoted to such subject it was given by a
statute in another part of the code, which provided that a person doing a cer
tain thing might "be convicted and punished" in the same manner as if such
crime had been committed in this State. The word "punishable," used 'ln sec
tion 27, ls even a broader.word than either of those used in the section there con
strued. Punishable includes not only the extent of punishment possible to be
Inflicted, but the liability to trial, conviction and punishment.
The question here presented being to a certain extent a new one and there
being absolutely no case capable of being produced as a precedent which is as
the saying Is, "on all fours" with it, and Involving as it possibly does an' In
terpretation for the first time of section 27 of the Penal Code, It should be
passed upon by the Supreme Court, the Jurisdiction of which extends over the
entire State and the decision of which will govern all trial courts in the State in
which the question might In the future arise. ... '
I do not feel justified under my views, as hereinbefore expressed, in refusing
to pronounce judgment on a verdict of guilty, rendered In a case of murder so
monstrous and diabolical as the verdict in this case stamps this homicide to
have been. The crime Is almost unparalleled. Our code requires that Its provis
ions are to be construed according to the fair import of their terms, with a view
to effect its object and to promote justice. It would not be the promotion of
justice, but rather the promotion of a failure of Justice, to so construe the statute
as to permit a crime so diabolical as this to go unpunished and the criminal un
whipped of justice.
The motion In arrest of Judgment is denied.
An exception was taken to the second ruling of the court, and verbal
notice of appeal was given. Mrs. Botkln's lawyers will not busy themselves
preparing a bill of exceptions. The bill will be settled by the court and then
a writ of probable cause will be granted together with a stay of execution
In the meantime Mrs. Botkln will remain in the branch county Jail, a guest
of the Sheriff, with time sufficient before the Supreme Court disposes of the
matter to think over her past and sorrow over her future.
Although Mrs. Botkln seems resigned to fate, her attorneys are pleased
with the decision of Judge Cook. They state that the opinion, although
dwelling on the fact that such a crime as charged should be punished, cites
no law upon which it can be based, and they say that they can read between
the lines that Judge Cook Is of opinion that the prisoner must be released
still he leaves the responsibility of freeing the murderess in the hands of
the Supreme Court. They are satisfied with the holdings of the court and
are confident of success when the higher tribunal is reached.

Relative to the chances of the teachers
recovering their November-December sal
aries and the merchants their merchan
dise bills a prominent attorney said the
only method was for the victims to ap
ply to the Legislature for a relief appro
priation.
However desirous the present board may
be of paying the November-December sal
aries they cannot legally do so, even if
they ever have a surplus of funds. The
law says all surplus money of a fiscal
year must become a part of the funds of
the subsequent year.
President Bergerot of the Board of Ed
ucation stated yesterday that he was sat
isfied that the court would decide as it
did. By law the Board of Education can
not have and never had the authority to
pay the indebtedness of one year out of
the appropriation of a subsequent fiscal
year. By reason of the constitutional pro
vision, he said, the court was obliged to
hold that the Auditor had no right to pay
the $100,000 deficit of 1897-98 out of the
school fund provided for the fiscal year
1898-99.
"The entire appropriation," continued
Mr. Bergerot, "amounts to $1,217,140, and
the Auditor's books show that up to Jan
uary, 1898. $572,899 was expended. This
leaves available on January 1, 1899, a sum
of $644,240 97. Now, under the one-twelfth
act, the present board is entitled to six
twelfths of the entire appropriation, to
wit, to the sum of $608,570. By subtract
ing this last amount from the amount
available January 1, 1899, we have a bal
ance of $35,670 97, which must be credited
to the first six months of the fiscal year.
Out of the sum of $35,670 97 should be paid
probably $190,000, the November-December
salaries of teachers and janitors, and
about $88,000 for miscellaneous demands
already audited."
Director Holbrook, chairman of the
Finance Committee, with Superintendent
of Construction Walker and a building
expert, has visited a large number of the
schoolhouses, and he finds many of them
in a wretched and shameful condition.
He states that the $71,000 asked for by
the building committee Is not too much
for needed work in the seventy-seven
school buildings of the city, but it must
be cut to not over $30,000. The plumbing
in some of the buildings is almost useless
and the sanitary condition of many out
houses and sheds is such that the Health
Officers are liable to come down on them
any day.
The following is a comparison of the
expenditures of the last board with the
proposed expenditure of the present board
for a period of six months:
July 1 to Dec. Jan. 1 to July
31, 1898. Committee. 1, 1899.
$71,934 Buildings $30,000
72.838 Supplies 15.000
2,177 Printing 2,000
15.245 Finance 8,000
578,000 Salaries 516,000
The amount of the salaries of the old
board, including November and December,
is $743,194. Auditor Wells has declined to
audit the January salary warrants until
he has received legal advice from his at
torney, General Dickinson, who is in Sac
ramento. This will prevent the salaries
being paid to-morrow. With February
salaries will be paid the 20 per cent held
back from the January money, and all
months hereafter will be settled in full.
As the work of adjustment goes on, the
incompetents who have burdened the
teachers' pay roll for years are gradually
being brought into notice. In the reclas
sification system they were shifted
around, but no effort was then made to
investigate their fitness.
"I knew" there was a number of these in
ellgibles,", said Superintendent Webster
yesterday, "and that their cases . would
come up for investigation in good time.
The method now being pursued is to let
their new principals report upon their
competency, or even virtually refuse to
receive them as teachers in their respect-,
ive schools. Such reports will, of course,
contain reasons for such rejections, and
so the question of professional fitness will
come before the board. One paper has
published a list of eighteen alleged to be
old and otherwise incompetent. Prob
ably six or seven of them will be sub
jects of investigation, while among the
others are some of tbe best teachers of
the department.
"Every teacher's qualifications will be
weighed and only complete fitness will
keep them on the rolls. But few com
flaints have come to my office to-day and
am pleased to see that affairs are get
ting down to a smooth condition again."

SEATTLE, Feb. 4.â has Just leak
ed out that through an accidental fire
last Wednesday night the two great
guns Intended for the principal defense
for the fortifications at Marrowstone
Point were ruined, causing a loss to
Uncle Sam of $200,000.
People who have been near the Port
Townsend point recently have noticed
that the mammoth guns were no longer
lying in the sand on the beach fronting
on the fortification, but had been haul
ed up close underneath the high bluff
and raised on a bed consisting of heavy
dry timber cribs, three in number and
twelve feet high. These cribbing sup
ports were located at the muzzle,
breach and center of the forty-foot
guns. As soon as the cribbing had
been completed and the guns mounted
several workmen were detailed to cover
the pieces with a preparation of tar and
lampblack to keep them from rusting,
and it was from this work that the
guns went to destruction.
A small temporary furnace was built
some distance from the cribs, where
the coating was prepared. Several
nights ago, when the workmen had
ceased work, a strong wind sprang up
and fanned the embers in the furnace
into a blaze, and carried it across to
the cribbing under the guns. The mid
dle crib was soon afire, and ln a mo
ment all were burning fiercely. The
guns were red-hot before the men at
the point arrived. Without thinking
of the consequences, the bucket brigade
deluged the guns with water.
The ordnance remained all that night
and for two days longer at a red heat,
and when they cooled and an exam
ination was made a long crack was
found near the muzzle of one, and both
were robbed of their high temper, ren
dering them useless.

announced that none but good Democrats

tt l\ torla, the 2-year-old daughter of Mr, and Mrs. Manuel Lopez of Col- 0
** f\ lege avenue and Calhoun street. The little one died because the.- 0

0 able to provide It with clothing other than few scanty cast-off rags 0
0 picked up in the streets. 0
0 There are six small children in the family. For many months the fa- 0
0 ther has been unable to secure work of any description and after his 0
0 scanty savings were exhausted he was too proud to appeal to charity for 0
0 assistance, preferring to undergo the torture of seeing his family slowly 0

MULLIHS SAYS
A PUGILIST
ROBBED HIM
A Warrant for Danny
Needham.
MONEY LOST IN A SALOON
THE VICTIM SAYS HE WAS HELD
DOWN AND GAGGED.
Not the First Time "The Drum"
Saloon Has Been Heard From
in Connection With '..' <
Crime.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, Feb. 4.
William Mullins does not wish to be
arrested for compounding a felony, and he
has therefore sworn to a warrant charg
ing Danny Needham, the well-known pu
gilist, and M. P. Conway, a saloon-keeper,
with robbing him of $97.
A few days ago Mullins, who Is an em
ploye of the postoffice, reported to the
police that he had been robbed in Con
way's saloon on Washington street. He
refused to say who robbed him, as he did
not want any arrests made. Since then
Mullins has changed his mind. He says
that he went into the Drum saloon with
a friend and with $112 in his pocket. After
they had had a few drinks Mullins says
his friend went out, and while he was
alone Needham seized him and held him
down with one hand over his mouth,
while he (Needham) and Conway went
through his pockets. Mullins says that
after the robbery Conway and Needham
divided the money.
The pugilist and Conway deny the rob
bery, and say that if Mullins lost money
it was at gambling. Conway was arrested
to-day, but Needham has not yet been
found. Some time ago a robbery was re
ported at the Drum saloon, and Conway
and Needham were said to be implicated
in it. As the alleged victim was not con
sidered reliable, no effort was made to se
cure a conviction. In the present Instance
the case will be prosecuted with vigor,
although Mullins ls absolutely at a loss
for corroborative testimony. y*/'

WILL HAVE A HOSPITAL.
Alameda Presented With a Building
for Use in Emergency Cases.
ALAMEDA. Feb. Recent causal ties
In Alameda have brought the necessity
of a receiving hospital forcibly. to the at
tention of the public. At the meeting of
the Board of Health last evening the Ala
meda Women's Exchange offered the city
a building for hospital purposes and the
offer was formally accepted.
The structure stands on. a, lot on
Park street, adjoining the water works
THE SAN- FRANCISCO CALL, STJNDA\, FEBRUARY 5, ,1809;
building. It will be moved to the city's
property on Oak street, in rear of the
City Hall. Two months at least will
elapse before it will be fitted up for a
hospital. .
The building has a history, and bears
the unique distinction of having been
stolen from its owners one night and
moved away. The. Women's Exchange
had two factions, one favorable to a Mrs.
Carpenter, who was manager of the con
cern and occupied the building as her
home, and the other opposed to the lady
and desirous of having her deposed. The
latter faction incorporated and demanded
possession of the building. Mrs. Carpen
ter claimed she owned it and refused to
vacate. Her friends undertook to, help
her out, and during the night of March
14, 1894, went' to her place. with a gang
of housemovers .and began to take the
structure to a new location. They suc
ceeded in getting it a block away before
the attorneys for the corporation got the
counts to interfere. The building was
on the streets for nearly two weeks before
it made the circuit. of the block and fin
ally brought up at its original location,
It has been a bane of contention among
the ladies ever since, and the presentation
to the city is looked upon as the most
satisfactory way of settling a trouble of
long standing. â¢ "
The Alameda Red Cross. Society is
largely composed of the members of the
Women's Exchange, and it is a singular
coincidence that the factions who fought
over the quaint little building are almost
identical with those who now threaten to
go to war with each other over the fail
ure to arrange a public reception for Com
pany G. __._.Â«. m
A general meeting of the exchange will
be â¢ held Monday night, when steps will
be taken to disincorporate. It is stated
that an effort will be made to get the
City Trustees to appoint Mrs. S. A. O Neil
matron of the hospital. She is at present
managing the Women's Exchange.
Broke His Enemy's Leg.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 4â The preliminary
hearing of A. H. Cohen, charged with
felonious assault, began this morning be
fore Justice Stetson of Oakland, sitting
for Justice of the Peace Morris. The
complaining witness is Ivy L. Borden, su
perintendent of the Artesian Water
Works. A. A. Moore assisted Deputy
District Attorney Melvin in the prosecu
| tion, and Emil- Nusbaumer represented
the defendant. On account of the promi
nence of the parties interested the case
is creating considerable interest. .?- -y ~
Some time ago Cohen secured a loan
from Borden. At that time they were
fast friends. During May of last year
Borden was forced to sue Cohen for the
recovery of the money. A coolness fol
lowed. Subsequently the parties met on
Broadway Cohen was driving In his
buggy and Borden was riding in a cart.
They had some words, both pulled their
whips and began slashing at each other
while they drove their rigs around in a
circle. Finally Cohen deliberately drove
into Borden's rig, so the testimony goes,
upsetting it and throwing its occupant
out. Borden's leg was broken in the
fracas.
The case is being bitterly fought, and
after a day's wrangling in court the at
torneys got through with but three wit
nesses. The case will go on agaih Mon
day afternoon. . ';*y':

mystery. The flames were discovered in
the rear portion of the second story, and
before the Fire Department arrived had
communicated with the roof. After half

HIT BY THE TRAIN.
John Littlefield Is Knocked OH a
Drawbridge.
OAKLAND, Feb. 4.â John Littlefield,
bridge-tender on the new Harrison street
bridge, lies in a critical condition at Fabi
ola Hospital, the result of Injuries sus
tained by being struck by the Alameda
broadgauge local at. 8 o'clock this morn
ing. It is supposed that Littlefield was
engaged in oiling up the machinery with
warm oil at the time, as the cold weather
had Â« hardened the lubricant about the
gear of the bridge so that it was al
most impossible to open the draw.
Apparently he did not observe the ap-
Eroarhing train. He was knocked off the
ridge and down' upon some of the piling
below, where he was afterward picked
up by* one of the switchmen. The injured
mam was immediately removed to Fab
iola Hospital, where Drs. Olmsted and
MeiÂ£s, the railroad physicians, attended
him. They found no bones broken and his
injuries are confined to the head, though
lt is not 'yet* known whether the skull is
fractured. He - was ; still . unconscious "at
midnight and little hope Is entertained' for
his chances. He is about 30 years old.
CRUSHED BY
THE CRANK OF
HIS ENGINE
Horrible Death of G.
F. Patterson.
HE WAS INSTANTLY . KILLED
HIS BODY MANGLED BEYOND
RECOGNITION.
No One Can Say How the Accident
Happened, as the Engine Was
Not Going Just
Before.
OAKLAND, Feb. George Frederick
Patterson, an engineer residing at 501
Santa Clara avenue, Alameda, met a hor
rible death on the Alameda Mole shortly
after 3 o'clock this afternoon. His body
was so frightfully mangled between the
crank of the donkey engine and the fric
tion drum of the piledriver that be was
unrecognizable when he was found.
For the past week or more the pile
driver force had been engaged in
strengthening the end of the narrow
gauge mole, and Mr. Patterson has been
in charge of the donkey engine about
three weeks. The piling work was practi
cally completed this afternoon, and the
donkey engine and driver, which are sta
tioned on a flatcar, were moved about
fifty feet back, so as to permit the men
to remove the tracks that had been tem
porarily laid to accommodate the outfit.
The engine had shut down, but steam
was still up, and Engineer Patterson was
engaged in cleaning, wiping and oiling the
machinery. Suddenly, the engine- started
running again. This attracted the atten
tion of Foreman James Ross and a helper
named Daniel J. Desmond, and they were
the first to realize that the engineer was
being mangled. Desmond quickly climbed
up to the throttle and stopped. the machi
nery from further beating the form into
a mass of bleeding flesh. . .-. .
"When we heard the 'engine spinning
like a buzzsaw we knew that there was
something wrong," said Foreman Ross,
in giving his view of the accident to
night. - "And when we reached the engine
we saw that Patterson was being crushed
by the crank. The engine had not run
over twenty seconds before Desmond
reached the throttle and shut her down.
No one knows how It all happened, for no
one saw Patterson fall, and the only way
to my mind In which it could have hap
pened is this: Patterson was probably
oiling up, and held his oiler in his left
hand. In reaching over to the small cog
wheels his* slipped and he 611 across the
driving rod. at the same time, in trying to
save himself he grabbed hold of the
throttle, pulling it wide open, starting up
the engine at full speed. - t"
"There is a key that protrudes about
two. inches near the end of the driving
rod. .Patterson's jacket caught on this
and he was hurled over the end of the
crank and crushed between it and the
friction drum just ahead." " â â¢; â¢â â â¢â 
Not an outcry had been heard and death
had been apparently instantaneous. Be
spattered with blood the men set to work
and extricated the mangled, form with
considerable difficulty. The remains were
immediately taken to the Morgue.
Dr. Jeremiah' Maher conducted a post
mortem examination. He found the
â¢breast-bone torn away an* in being torn
it was separated from all the ribs, which
were fractured. The heart" and lungs
were crushed out of all normal shape.
The aorta was snapped as were all the
large veins. The left side of the face and
neck was also torn away. In Dr. Maher's
opinion death had been instantaneous. At
the inquest to-night the Coroner's jury
brought in a verdict of accidental death.
Deceased was a native of New Jersey,
aged 52 years. For some years he was
employed under the State Harbor Com
missioners, and was always regarded a
careful and capable engineer. He leaves a
widow and five childrenâ George, Joseph,
Tot and Emma Patterson and Mrs. A.
V. Clark, wife of City Trustee Clark of
Alameda. - '

A HARE THAT
RAN INTO THE
JAWS OF DEATH
Red Wings and O'Gra
dy Pumped Out.
A HARD THREE-MILE COURSE
SPORT THAT WAS GREATLY EN
JOYED AT INGLESIDE PARK.
,
Commodore Disappointed His Friends
Who Wagered Good Money
on Him to Beat
Mohawk.
Notwithstanding that the cold weath
er deterred many sport-lovers from at
tending outdoor amusements yesterday,
the crowd of pleasure-seekers at Ingle
side Coursing Park was astonishingly
large. Captain . Clarkson, who is in
command of the pool boxes, thought
that one box would be sufficient to han
dle the coin wagered on the results,
but before half a dozen races were con
cluded he ' found his mistake and or
dered two extra boxes to be placed in
motion, all of which did a very lively
business.
The coursing was first class, as usual;
the dogs ran well, and the hares up
held their reputations for speed and
staying qualities. Commodore ran
very poorly. In fact he showed a strong
desire to lurch and run cunning and
was beaten handily by Mohawk, a sec
ond-class dog. The owner of Commo
dore stated that the dog was injured
a few weeks ago by having come in
contact with a wire fence, but if his
words were true, the betting public
should have been guarded and a notice
to the effect that the dog was not in
condition placed on the blackboard un
der the heading "remarks." Commo
dore sold a strong fa\ orite. â ,-//
The Ingleside coursing fraternity was
pleased to see Martin Kerrigan once
again in the old park. Kerrigan is an
able supporter of the game who takes
a very active interest in coursing. His
pup Honeymoon displayed very good
form, handsomely defeating Star of
Cuba, and St. Gertrude in the open
stake beat Peaceful Glen almost point
less. Flying Buck ran with great speed
and dash yesterday and scored a "no
go" with Lalla Rookh, but in the tun
off the old dog Avon handsomely. .
Scott Free, a recent importation from
Kansas, will, never make a bread-win
ner. His gait is altogether too free and
open and not of the kind to please crit
ics of the game. O'Grady and Red
Wings were slipped to a frisky jack
that ran ahead of his pursuers until he
had covered fully two miles of sod,
then, turning suddenly from his path,
he ran deliberately into the mouth of
O'Grady, who had barely strength suf
ficient to make the kill. Judge Grace
was under the impression that the hare
either had had an understanding with
O'Grady by which he was to win the
course, or decided upon suicide as the
shortest .and best way to escape from
an imprisoned life. This was the long
est course of the day and lasted 3 min
utes 45 seconds. - .-;" >
The sport this afternoon will be, par
ticularly good, as the hares are run
ning like March hares, and doubtless
some of the dogs that are not 'trained
to the hour may be carried off Che field
dead to the world.
The dogs that won and" lost yester
day in the run-down of the big stake
are as follows: â % *y"j

PARDY MAY RECOVER.
The Bullet Has Been Located and
Will Be Removed To-Day.
William-. S. Pardy, the cashier of the
Paciflc States Loan and Building Society',
who was shot Friday afternoon by Chris-
tlan Reis Jr., was resting . easily last
night and the physicians in attendance
have every hope for his ultimate recov
ery. ' â -'Â«'*"â¢ r .yyy' -' â¢
The condition of the wounded man was
such' yesterday that it was considered
j inadvisable to remove him to his home,
I so the bank was closed and Pardy made
as comfortable as possible in a room at
j the rear of the office. His relatives and
: the doctors remained with him all of last
j night and Friday night.
A careful examination of the wound was
' made yesterday and the physicians be
i lieve that they have located the bullet.
: It entered the left breast, struck a rib
| and glanced over to the right side, prob
i ably lodging in the seventh rib. An X ray
i will be used to-day, and if the theory of
I the ; physicians is verified, the bullet will j
be removed from the back by incision.
Reis is still confined at the City Prison, !
j but no charge has been placed against |
: him, as the police wished to learn the !
i outcome of Pardy's injuries before charg- j
i ing the prisoner. It is probable that in i
I the event of Pardy's recovery Reis will j
j not be prosecuted. The injured man made I
a statement to Lieutenant Esola immedi- j
I ately after the shooting, but refused to
sign it. He stated to friends that on ac- 1
count of the friendship which had al- |
I ways existed between his family and that
I of Reis he did not. wish to prosecute his
assailant. Pardy asked his father to re
frain from prosecuting Reis in case of his
death, but Mr. Pardy Sr. refused to make
any promise to' that* effect, y

WRIGHT LOCKS
HORNS WITH THE
COMMISSIONERS
New Scandals Develop in the
Wreck of the Union Savings
Bank of San Jose.
Managers of the Defunct Institution Gave
Favor and Financial Support to Real
Estate Speculators-Official In
vestigators on the Defensive.
The customary post-mortem explana
tions, regrets, imprecations and abuse
that follow the death of a banking in
stitution are now being heard in refer
ence to the collapse of the Union Sav
ings Bank of San Jose. The Bank Com
missioners have finished their work,
which, as usual, was nothing more than
that done by the official undertaker.
Bankers and financiers are telling each
other what might have been if the in- j
stitution had not failed and the man- '
agers had exercised the judgment of
business men instead of the spirit of j
gamblers. The depositors are survey- j
ing the wreck with what calmness they !
may command and are nursing the loss
: : of their savings as philosophically as
. may be.
. The collapse of the Union Savings
Bank fortunately has not involved any
other Institution. The law will now
take its course and another anomaly
will present Itself. The Bank Commis
sion is supposed to be a protection to
depositors and creditors of banks, to
save the public from reckless or un
scrupulous financiers and to prevent ill
advised speculations with the money of
the public. The commissioners are ex
pected, â  under the fiction of the law,
to keep a watchful eye on all the banks
of the State and to set an emphatic
veto upon any course of action that
may be detrimental. As a matter of
fact this is just what the Bank Com
missioners do not accomplish.
The commissioners may warn as
much as they please, but if anything
more serious than a warning is at
tempted the very thing the commission
ers seek to accomplish will bl^destroy
ed. If by any act the commissioners
call attention to a bank, whose condi
tion is not sound, the credit of the sus
pected institution will be at once im
paired and the commissioners will have
done what they sought to avoid.
The Union Savings Bank of San Jose
affords an admirable illustration of
this fact. In 1897 the Bank Commis
sioners warned the directors of the
Union Bank that they were permitting
E. B. Howard to have too large an
overdraft. Howard's overdraft at that
time was only a trifle more than $30,000.
The directors paid no attention to the
warning, and Howard's overdraft in
creased rapidly to enormous propor
tions. In November last the amount
was $141,000, and again the directors
were sharply reprimanded- H. Ward
Wright, who was president of the bank,
â¢was given a severe lecture and was or
dered to report to the commissioners
within thirty days. That report should
have been submitted not later than De
cember 21 last, but Wright ignored the
injunction of the commissioners and his
own promise. z
. The commissioners claim that they
did not dare take public action, as they
would have provoked a panic and a
run on the bank. The result was that
the institution under Wright's presi
dency continued on its wild course. On
December 3 the commissioners issued
a sharp order to the bank authorities
to reduce the enormous overdrafts en
joyed by flve customers. Instead of
obeying the orders of the commission
ers the directors of the bank permitted
their favorites to make further over
drafts to the amount of $-50,000. In the
language of financiers this action on
the part of the directors is character
ized as "poor judgment." The deluded
depositors! whose money .was being dis
sipated in overdrafts to gamblers, have
a more expressive and emphatic term
With which to describe the incident.
The disclosures made in the report
of the Bank Commissioners show that
Howard and other gamblers in fruit
were not the only speculators that had
the favor and the financial backing of

BABY'S AWFUL BURN
Large as a Silver Dollar. Hot
Coffee Scalds Breast and Hands.
Skin Comes Off With Clothes.
All Remedies Useless.
CURED BY CUTICURA
My little boy was two years old when he
reached upon the table and spilled a cup of
hot coffee all over his left hand. It had gone
through to his breast, and before I could
remove his clothes lt had burned his breast,
and the skin came off with the clothes, and
he has to-day a scar as large as a silver dollar
on his breast. I applied a great many things.
The burn was a very ugly one, hard to heal.
I was requested to try CUTICURA (ointment),
which healed up rapidly, but before I used a
half a box of CUTICURA It was well. Oh I
think CUTICURA Is the salve above all others.

I was obliged to keep the first three fingers

the Union Savings Bank. The officers
of the defunct institution gambled also
in real estate valuations. One of the
enormous overdrafts permitted by the
bank was that given to J. F. Devendorf,
a speculator in real estate. Devendorf
was allowed to make an overdraft of
$35,873 99 and was in addition given a
commercial loan of $20,000. This enor
mous sum for a bank of the resources
of the Union Bank is represented in
slough lands, near Stockton. Some of
these days this land may have a value
and it may not have. It was purchased
as a speculation contingent upon what
the managers of the Valley Railroad
might do. At present the land is prac
tically unavailable as an asset. But it
represents the earnings of poor people
and the investments of honest business
men.
One of the worst phases of the fail-
soe_2>t:e OF THE foul CRIME.!
ure of the Union Savings Bank Is the
fact that commercial and savings de-
posits are involved. A few years ago
the directors amended the articles of
lncorporaion so that a commercial busi
ness as well as a savings business could
be transacted. The name of the bank,
however, was not changed and- to un
suspecting people It continued to be ex
clusively a savings bank.
The responsibility of the wreck of the
Union Bank Is upon the shoulders of
the officers of the institution. Yet these
very men who have ruined the . bank
will wind up Its affairs if the courts de
clare the bank Insolvent. This. is an
anomaly of the law that the new Bank
Commissioners understand but em
phatically do not Indorse. When a bank
is legally declared insolvent the law of
the State provides that the officers of
the defunct institution and not the
Bank Commissioners shall carry the
bank through liquidation. The com
missioners may prescribe the, number
of officers and. may fix their salaries,
but the authority thus exercised is
purely supervisory.
COMMISSION ACCUSED
OF GRAVE OFFENSES
Wright Says Report of Bank's
Affairs Is Maliciously
Inaccurate.
SAN JOSE, Feb. 4.â H. Ward Wright,
ex-president of the Union Savings
Bank, declares that the State Bank
Commissioners have willfully misrepre
sented the facts in regard to the finan
cial condition of the wrecked institu
tion and he denies absolutely that the
bank ever received the letter alleged to
have been sent by the commission.
This letter, which was published this
morning in The Call, called attention to
the unsafe condition of the bank. In
this letter the commissioners demanded
that steps be at once taken to increase
the reserve of cash to a sum equal to
25 per cent of its commercial liability
and to a sum equal to 20 per cent of Its
savings liability. It demanded further
that overdrafts to Thomas E. Johnson,
J. V. Devendorf, the Jersey Landing
Tract, the Santa Clara Fruit Exchange
and Howard & Company be stopped at
once and all such overdrafts be secured
by notes executed by said parties, with
securities satisfactory to the directors
of the bank and the Bank Commission-
ers and that the action of the bank of
ficials in the matter be reported to the
commission In thirty days.
"I never heard of any such letter un
til I saw what purports to be a copy of
the document in The Call this morn
ing," said Mr. Wright to-day. â  "The
Bank Commissioners never intimated
that they thought the bank finances
were in an unsafe condition and never
said anything about .the .necessity of
Increasing the reserve: They did re
mark, in a casual manner, when they
were here in November, that the over
drafts should be looked after, but they
did not make any demand to that ef
fect. The letter alleged to have been
written on December 3 was never re
ceived by. the bank to my. knowledge,
nor any other letter bearing on the
subject. The statement given out
by the commissioners yesterday In San
Francisco is full of " inaccuracies and
grossly exaggerated.
"The overdraft of J. P. Devendorf and
that of Thomas E. Johnson are amply
secured, while the alleged overdraft of
THE SAN FRANCISCO, ALL, â  SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1899.
the Santa Clara . Fruit , Exchange for
$15,422 10 exists only in the imagination
of the commissioners. I have not the
figure- here, but I think that, if any
thing, the bank is slightly indebted to
the Santa Clara. Fruit Exchange. The
commissioners say the Jersey Landing
Tract was permitted to overdraw . its
account $20,915 58, when as a matter of
fact the bank never had any dealings
with that concern and I am at a loss
to understand how the commissioners
could make such a blunder. The truth
will be known in time."
Mr. "Wright persists in his contention
that the only transaction which is in
any way reprehensible or indicative. of
bad Judgment on the part of the bank
officials is the making of unsecured
loans to Howard, and he thinks when
all the facts are known the public will
not place all the responsibility for this
affair upon his shoulders..
The published statement of the com
missioners relative to the condition of
the affairs of the bank has increased
the apprehension of the depositors who
have been assured by the officials of the
ruined Institution that they would Vie
paid do'lar for dollar if the-/ would
have patience to wait until the assets of
the bank could be realized uoon. The
ruthless pruning of the assets by the
commissioners, by which over $490,000
of securities are thrown out as worth
less and thus bringing the availabla as
sets of the bank down to $138,215 35 less
than the liabilities, has had a most de
li essing effect
The stockholders now realize that
they will be exceedingly fortunate if
they receive fifty cents on the dollar,
while a much smaller dividend is ex
pected by those who have had some ex
perience in banking. But while the
depositors can look forward to a recov
ery of at least a portion of their money
the position of the many small holders
of the bank stock is more unfortunate.
Their stock has not only lost all value
as a marketable commodity that it may
have had previous to the failure, I but
has become a serious incumbrance. The
assessments will rutn many and cripple
the resources of others, and the full ex
tent of the disaster is but just begin
ning to dawn on the community.
The Bank Commission is being sub
jected to severe criticism. ... The fact
that two of the present members were
appointed after the examination of the
bank in November is being lost sight
of for the moment. The commission is
regarded as negligent of its sworn
duty, even to the point of criminality,
in not closing the doors of the bank at
the time when, according to its offi-
cial statement, the bank was known .to
be tottering on the verge of collapse.'
That the commission should send the
letter demanding that the bank officials:
take immediate steps to remedy the
evils which the commissioners knew
would cause its ruin if. allowed to' con
tinue to exist and then neglect to fol
low up . and enforce its j demand, is , de
clared by prominent business , men in I
this city to be an unheard of piece of
folly and an exhibition . of Incompe
tency and indifference to the welfare; of
the depositors almost unparalleled.
The ostensible work of the commis
sion has long been regarded as a farce
and the manner of conducting its bus!-:
ness as shown in . this instance
strengthens the well-founded- belief
that it is maintained simply for the'
purpose of providing jobs for men hav
ing political pulls. .'? : '-â¢ â  '
Dr. Frank Finigan of this city Is one
of those who were caught by the failure
of the bank, but unlike his fellow vic
tims, he succeeded in dragging his
money from under the wreckage, .al
though in order to attain this result he
was obliged to resort to drastic means.
A short time ago Dr. Finigan suffered
a loss by fire and a few days before
the failure he received a draft from the
insurance company for nearly a thous
and dollars in settlement of his claim.
He placed the draft in the Unions Sav
ings Bank for collection. "When the
crash came the dentist hurried to the
bank and demanded his money. He
was informed that the bank having
suspended, It was impossible to accom
modate him. , .-.-'â,' .*
Dr. Finigan 'then placed the matter
In the hands of Attorney S. F. Leib,
who acted promptly. He notified the
bank officials that they must render an
accounting of the commission given
them to collect the draft and that; tha
money must be paid to his client at
once. He gave the bank people until 3
o'clock Thursday afternoon to: produce
the coin, and informed them that- if It
was not forthcoming' at that hour he
would swear out warrants for the. ar
rest of every officer of the Institution
on a criminal charge. The money was
forthcoming at the appointed time.

HEAD AND FACE
GASHED WITH
A HATCHET
Murderous Assault on
Adolph Schmid.
FEARFUL CRIME OF A FIEND
HE INFLICTS ELEVEN HORRI
BLE WOUNDS.
The Victim an ex-Convict Recently
; Released, and His Assailant
Is Supposed to Be a
Chinaman.
Adolph Schmld, an ex-convict, was hor
ribly slashed , about the head and face
early Saturday â¢. morning, in a lodging
house at 815 Stockton street, by some un
known person, who used a dull hatchet to
accomplish his . purpose. . The assaulted
man evidently made a struggle for his
life, for the walls and furniture In the
room, No. 27, .which he occupied were
frightfully bespattered with blood.
When Frederick Delmas, a lodger ln
room : 26, heard a fall In Schmld's room,
which is opposite to his, as of some dull
object striking the floor, and after that
the footsteps of a man descending the
stairs, he thought nothing of it and rolled
over in his bed and went to sleep. When
he got up in the morning he no
ticed that the door of Schmld's room was
open about two inches. Thinking some
thing was ! wrong, he reported it to Or.
Pons, the landlord/ Together they went
into the room and a fearful sight met
their gaze. On the floor near the dresser,
and covered by a bloody sheet, lay
Schmid,* weltering in his own blood.
Everything in the room was in confusion
and the bedclothes and. pillow were satu
rated with his. life's fluid. His head lay
in a large pool and his brains were oozing
out from the terrible wounds he had re
ceived. Hastening from the terrifying
sight. Pons ran out and notified Police
man McGovern, who -rang in for the Cali
fornia-street station ambulance. Officer
J. C. Edwards responded and when he ar
rived the man had walked over to the
bed, where he was profusely expectorat
ing blood.
He was taken to the Harbor Hospital,
where Drs. Yon der Lelth and C. A.
Freuholtz attended the dying man. They
found that his murderous assailant had
inflicted three gashes on the crown of the
head; penetrating the brain; a cut on the
right cheek, . which fractured the lower
jaw; two horrible gashes on the neck; had
gouged the left â  eye entirely out; gashed
the upper part of the cheek- so as to cut
through the cheek-bone, and inflicted sev
eral other cuts about the head, making in
all eleven wounds. Schmid presented a
fhastly sight and could not talk. The
octors say he cannot live.
â  Detectives Wren â¢ and Dlnan were put
on the case immediately and went to the
scene of the murder to secure any evi
dence there might be. They learned
that. Schmid had gone to bed about 11
o'clock Friday night, attired in his under
clothes,, and was asleep when attacked.
He had probably got out of bed in a vain
attempt to defend himself, for blood
spots covered the walls , and tho wash
stand' in the. further corner of the room.
The officers , searched the house in the
endeavor to locate the weapon, but were
unsuccessful. The halls and stairway
were free from ' blood stains and it is
thought that the fiend wrapped the hatchet
in' a piece of paper or cloth and threw
it out of the window and picked It up
again or took it with him when he made
his escape.
; It -is thought , that the motive of the
crime was robbery, as Schmid had ex
hibited some money In a saloon before he
went to his room. on Friday night, and
the, deed must, have been committed by
a man of his own class.
Schmid, under the name ; of Charles
Smith, was sentenced to seven and one
half years in San; Quentln on October ,4,
1893, for grand larceny and was released
on October, 19, 1898. About, two weeks
before his release the. -German Consul
made Inquiries about him at police head
quarters, saying that he had been left an
inheritance in the old* country. Since
then ' he always appeared to have money,
which he was very fond of exhibiting.
Pons, the landlord. â  says -that Schmid
had rented the room from him eleven days
ago, paying two weeks' rent in ; advance.
He was dressed well Â for his class and
never had any visitors, male or female,
while in the 'house.;
: Schmid received about $200 from home
several .. days ago, and, meeting Detec
tive Wren on the street, said that he was
going to lend a better, life. Friday niÂ«*ht
he ;- procured a new suit of - clothes and
shoes and * was - with â¢ a friend, J. . Kllborn
of 633 California street, until '-â  11 . o'clock.
They visited* a poolroom;. together and
Schmid exhibited a chamois bag contain
ing $50. Kllborn told him to put his money j
away, saying that the fellows who hung
around the place might rob him. The two
made an engagement to go to the races,
and Schmid was to meet his friend yes
terday morning at 11 o'clock. As Schmid
did not put in an appearance Kliborn
went over to the room : and was dum
founded when told that Schmid had been
nearly murdered. He was shown the
chamois bag and two* empty purses, which
he said belonged to his friend.
Various theories are advanced as tb the
cause of the assault, but the most plausi
ble ;is Schmld's own assertion when he
regained consciousness in the hospital.
Detective. Tom Ellis, who occupied â¢ a
place near the cot, put some questions
to the man and gathered from him that
a Chinaman had committed the foul
crime on account or some Chinese woman.
Schmid keeps repeating "to-morrow," as
if he will tell all about If" then, but to
morrow for him may never come. Who
ever committed the crime must have been
deluged * with blood after raining the
murderous blows upon his helpless vic
tim. The doctors cannot understand how
Schmid survived the attack at all, as al
most any of the blows was sufficient to
cause death. No one saw Schmid when
he entered the house Friday night, so it
is not known whether he had a compan
ion or not. On a table in the gory apart
ment were the remains or a piece of pie,
a ham sandwich, two Chinese cigars and
some Chinese melon seeds, of which the
murdered man had evidently partaken be
fore he retired to the sleep from which
he was so fearfully disturbed.
Detectives Dinan and Wren, who were
detailed to find the assailant of Schmid,
made their report last night to Captain of
Detectives Bohen. They < are convinced
that Schmid was not wounded by a Chi
naman, as he first claimed, but was as
saulted by one of his pals. They believe
that he and his assailant had a quarrel,
perhaps, over the division of spoils, and
that his brutal adversary, in a moment
of desperation, picked up a hatchet and
inflicted the injuries from which he Is
dying. Last evening they visited the
Harbor Hospital, where Schmid was
taken, and proceeded to question the
wounded man. He persistently refused
to give the name of the , hatchet wlelder,
but admitted that he was one of his pals.
The detectives think they know the as
sailant of Schmid and expect to arrest
him to-day. y. i-
Lieutenant Esola and Detective Wren,
who are working on the case, have come
to the conclusion that it was not a China
man but a white man who did the cutting.
They are on the trail of a person who
they believe is the guilty party, and ex
pect to land him to-day.
DR. L. C. LANE'S PRECAUTION.
Will Make a New Deed to Directors
of Cooper College.
Dr. L. C. Lane, founder and builder of
the Cooper Medical College, has taken
steps to prevent the handsome structure
at the corner of Sacramento and Webster
streets from being used after his death
for any purpose other than the one for
which he established it. The uirectors of
the Cooper Medical College appeared at
the Recorder's office yesterday and filed
a deed transferring the property to Dr.
Lane. The doctor personally appeared at
the Recorder's office yesterday and deeded
the property back again to the directors
of the college, but in the deed it will be
specifically provided that after his death
yie directors of the Cooper Medical Col
lege shall be restrained from using any
part of the building for any purpose other
than the one for which it was constructed.
It will be also provided in the deed that
at no time shall the directors be allowed
to affiliate any component or Integral
part of the college with any other institu
tion. . '
"I am simply taking. ordinary precau
tions," said Dr. Lane when seen at the
college last night. "The way the property
of the Toland Medical College has been
Juggled with has made me feel that lt
would be safer to incorporate these re
strictions in a new deed. If Dr. Toland
knew the fate of the Institution which
he established he would turn over in his
grave. I have the greatest confidence ln
the men who will look after the destiny
of the college after I am gone, but some
thing unforeseen may happen, and it Is al
ways best to be on the safe side.

THE Pacific States Fair, to be held
in San Francisco in 1901, is going
to be the greatest exposition of
its kind ever held.
So say all the members of the
flrst committee ,to be, appointed and
they are men who know what" they are
talking about. V-y, ':"'.â¢â ' 'â 
It is true that the exact plans of the
great exposition have not yet been de
cided upon. Everything "except the
plan for raising .the necessary money ie
â¢still in a most embryotic condition. Hut
everybody who has anything to do with
the fair is thinking day and night about
It. And in the minds of all some Idea
has taken definite shape. y' V.
At present a committee on perma
nent organization has been effected.
This consists of George A. Newhall as
chairman, and J. B. Reinstein, Mayor
Phelan, Henry J. Crocker, C. E. Grun
sky, R. P. Doolan and others as mem
bers.
The financial plans are already before
the proper bodies for consideration and
there is little doubt that they will
be carried through. About $2,000,000*18
needed to assure the success of the un
dertaking. y-"
The financial plan Includes a special
city and country tax of $900,000, a State
appropriation of $300,000, and a Con
gressional bounty of $250,000. So far
as known no opposition to this plan
has developed. y,y.
Of course it is most likely that the
big fair will be held in Golden Gate
Park. No thoughts of putting it any
where else .have been ; entertained by
the members of the committee. "I don't
know where else we could put it," said
a member of this committee, and he
but voiced the ideas of the others.
In order to house the exposition in
Golden Gate Park - the flrst man who
will have to be consulted .is Superin
tendent McLaren.
Build It Near the Beach in Golden Gate Park so as to Have a Lagoon on the Ocean Side for Vessels and a Great Lake for the Grand Court on the Grounds.
"Yes, I suppose the fair will come out
to the Park," said Mr. McLaren, "but
we cannot decide anything definite until
all the plans for the buildings are laid
before us.
"Have I been doing any thinking on
the, subject?* Well, I should say. l had.
I have looked air over the grounds and
decide that there are only two. places
where the fair can be located; that is,
without destroying a great deal of im
provement and development that has
already, been done. - Of course we could
not honestly permit , such destruction
because it takes too many years to get
a good growth of timber on this sandy
soil. *-y yy';y:y; y-y: â :â 'â¢ ....-; .-

ANEW departure has been com
menced by the begging letter
writer. So much unpleasant-
ess has been caused of late by
i the meddling and interfering
action of the Char\y Organiza
tion Society, so many really beautiful
businesses have been quite broken up,
that the profession seem resolved upon
trying, instead of letters, a round of
begging vl.its from house to house.
They seem to get first some clue to the
name and perhaps the character of the
tenant; they ring the bell: they, want
to sc_ the master; if hi out. they
wish to see the mistress on important
business. If they succeed, .the tale of
woe is poured c V with volubility;
never, surely. 1"- there been an un
fortunate man more griev usly afflicted
than this poor victim of fate. He has
been scourged with scorpions; he has
been pursued by a more than common
malignity of fortune. I have received,
and conversed - '- - yof these vis
itors. My answer is to take down their
addresses and to refer the case to the
Charity Organization Society. One
bucv car --- tr'- : .': a vÂ»ek ago. The
man' brought a letter In which he stated
that he was homeless and â r>- the
streets; thi. he had walked all the
way from Camberwell; . that he had
beeh'walking about all night long, with
move to the same effect. He did not
explain - he came to me all the wav
from Camberwell instead of trying
some local Samaritan. . In fact, he ex
plained nothing. I made him write
down his address. He forgot that in
his letter he said he was homeless, and
gave an address at Peckham. some six
miles away. The following letter from
the society shows the kind of person he
lsâ namely, a professional beggar: it
also shows that the profession is not
lucrative; So far the report ls satis

WHY I DON'T GO TO CHURCH
IT is a subject for frequently expressed regret in ministers' meet
ings and ministerial circles in general that so comparatively few
of our San Franciscan people attend church regularly. The lack
of Sabbath laws and the Ã¼biquitous circulation of Sunday news
papers have been variously blamed for the shortcomings of the
many who do not help to fill the comfortable pews of our numerous
places of worship. Although nearly every religion under the sun
has its representative here in our city only the distinctly fashionable
churches upon which society has set the seal of Its approval can
boast of an attendance which is at all satisfactory to their spiritual
directors, with the exception of the Catholic congregations, about
which little If any complaint is heard. -.*.':_,_ *.
Here are reasons from several prominent men why they do not
attend church: Â .
J. A. FILChER.
Secretary Board of Trade.
THE first and principal reason why I do not attend church is
that I rarely find a minister that interests me. Sometimes they
actually offend me; especially when they devote the time that
should be given to religion alone to panegyrics upon their
own particular denomination, tirades 'against all who do not
think just as they do, scientific lectures, or political speeches. The
Salvation Army seems to me to have more real religion than v most of
the churches. They teach more as Christ did, with the exception of
their noise, and the men and women who get down on their knees In
the muddy streets before jeering crowds to confess and pray to their'
Savior are either real Christians or arrant hypocrites.
I believe in God and Jesus Christ, and in all things good and holy,
but I do not think that It Is necessary for me to go to church in order
to prove this to the.world. If I saw a plainly marked distinction be
tween the professors and non-professors of religion In their dally
walk I might feel more drawn to what Ib known as "Christian com
panionship," but unfortunately charity, honesty and brotherly love
are not always the characteristics of our most .: prominent church
members. i â¢-â¢,;.
People attend church for many reasons besides religion; many go
to see others and be seen of them; young people often endure the, to
them, tedious service for the sake of. the compensating walk home
with a congenial spirit; some go to hear the music, others assume
the garb of religion for business or personally selfish reasons. The
spirit of the early. Christian, to whom religion was something real
and vital, to be lived ln and died for, seems to abide in very few. '

come here and see us, but he has not
answered. His address, 22 Hlght street.
Peckham, is a common lodging house,
and we learn from the deputy there
that this man has been lodging there
on . and off for the past year. Some
times he does not turn up for a week,
and at such times he has told the dep
uty that he has walked the streets all
night. My informant knows nothing
wrong about the man. and has never
seen him the worse for drink."
The man is young. What is his his
tory? Nobody knows. He is unwilling
to allow the C. O. S. people to learn it.
At all events here he is trying to live
by bringing begging letters to the doors
of people who know nothing about him.
If the man was worth anything at all
he would find friends to help him in
his own neighborhood. That he brings
his letters all the way from Peckham
to Hampstead stamps him at once as
a man of no character. Now. I dare,
say that this poor wretch is often as
miserable as a man can be. Still, we
ought not to give him the smallest help.
There are places provided in which he
can find shelterâ with work. Remem
ber always that such a man devours
the labors of others. If It costs Â£50 a
year to keep him, that money has got
to be found by the people who work.
Heavens! what a relief it would be to
the world if everybody would do his
own share of work!
It has been said over and over again
that if people refused the penny to the
casual beggar the trade of begging
would come to an end in a fortnight.
We have reduced the nuisance lower
than it has ever been before in history.
The beggar was a far greater burden
upon us formerly than he Is now. In
â¢ the Tudor times the danger and the
nuisance of the sturdy beggar, always
ready to be a robber and a murderer,
were intolerable; after every war dis
banded soldiers filled the streets beg
ging, threatening, robbing. During the
whole of the last' century London was
literally infested with beggars; on Sun
days they bribed the beadle to let them

of them trudged to the West End and
surrounded the . doors of gentlemen's
houses, holding out suppliant hands,
whining prayers for help, otten, when
there were . only ladies, resorting to
loud threats and curses. The squares
were systematically "begged" by young
girls, trained for the purpose, looking
plaintive, and dexterous in provoking
pity by means of their artful tale.
Thieving was carried on just as sys
tematically by the same persons. We
call out upon the eighteenth century
for Its savage code of punishments,
but we ought to remember the terri
ble provocations which they endured.
The thieves ventured everywhere; Into
the shops; into the private houses; they
haunted the inn yards where the stage
coaches arrived, and carried off the
portmanteaus and trunks; they haunt
ed the quays where the hoys and coast
ers were moored, and carried off the
luggage. "Hang them!" cried the ex
asperated shopkeeper. "They robbed
my till last week. The week before they
carried off a bale of my finest silk. Let
them be hanged! Hanging is not good
enough for them." Some improvement
we have effected, but the man still sings
along the roadâ he calls it, poetically,
"grldling on the main drag," and the
woman still crawls along with her two
children and her white apron; and the
professional still calls upon me and
Invites me, with a tale of unmerited
suffering, to keep him in laziness and
perjury.
The Scotch have a provisionâ l be
lieve in all their' townsâ means of
which a law agent or adviser in legal
matters is appointed in every district
for the poor. That is to say, the poor
are enabled by law to seek. legal advice
upon any matter upon which they are
in doubt for nothing at all. I have only
recently become acquainted with the
regulation; it reminds one that Scot
land and England are still different
kingdoms, with laws that differ in
many respects. How does this statute
work? I have a paper before me de
scribing what happened ' during ihe
writer's term of office as law agent in
one of the larger, not the largest,
towns in Scotland, with a population
of about 70,000. The person, to begin
with, who desires to employ the cerv
ices of the "town's writer," or adviser
for the poor goes flrst to the Sheriff's
clerks' office and gets a letter, which
is merely a formal matter and is given
to every applicant. He then carries
his letter to the agent and states his
difficulty. The agent, who holds office
for a twelvemonth, hears him, advises
him, and, if necessary, take the case
into court. The office is by no means
a sinecure. During the. writer's term
he was consulted by 221 persons, of
whom only twenty-four were men, and
the rest were women, varying In age
from 17 tq 90. The cases involved the
writing of 715 letters and seeing over
1000 persons. Most of the cases were
those of maintenance, chiefly brought
by parents against their sons. Some
were for slander, cruelty, libel, per
sonal injury and other matters.
Seventy per cent of the cases, were
those of parents against their sons for
aliment. In other cases drink was at
the bottom of all the trouble. How
ever, ; what the cases â _ were matters
nothing; the point is that in Scotland
justice can be had by the poorest for
nothing; not out of the rates; nobody
pays for It; the lawyers actually work
for nothing and apparently with will
ingness. It might be difficult to
make our lawyers work for nothing,
but perhaps it would not be impossible.
Each man's turn would come seldom.
It would be, for the term of office, a
heavy tax, but it would be the tax that
j they would pay, as in Scotland, for the
j privilege of working at all. There ar_
thousands of cases of ill-usage, neglect,
j desertion, oppression and injustice oc
! curring' daily among the poor of our
cities and towns for which they have
no redress because they cannot pay the
lawyer. The Scotch practice is en
forced by an ancient statute that a
"lawyer shall so give of his time and
money and ability for the love of God
and the cause of justice between man
and man." In one or two of our Lon
don "settlements" there is the "poor
man's lawyer," but the "settlements"
are few and far between; they are
oases of verdure arid refreshment In a
broad desert of weary and thirsty
sand. The Agent for the Poor. There
is a flne ring about the words. It looks
like a title of honor. But I fear it will
have to remain Scottish. . <
I believe In a religion of righteousnessâ doing right in all
things as far as is possible to humanity. All the days should be the
Lord's days, as far as doing good and being good is concerned.
I believe in churches as a moralizing influence, provided they are
not allowed -to degenerate into mere places of entertainment where
the music or sensational sermons. are. the chief attractions. When I
find my ideal church, where religion pure and simple Is simply and
purely taught, I shall be a regular and devout attendant.

I AM not what is known as a "church-going. man"; .that is, I am
not a regular attendant at any special place of worship,. nor am
I in any way identified with church. work or church affairs. There
is no special reason to be given for my position, or/rather, lack
of position, in this matter. The simple fact seems to be that re
ligion a3 preached by the average clergyman does not seem to appeal
to me or to be necessary to my spiritual well-being. By this Ido
not mean to criticize any of them; I merely, make the plain state
ment.. I am of the opinion, however, that a good deal of my disin
clination to attend church services is due to the fact that I took an
overdose of them under compulsion in my youthful days.
y I was born into a strict Methodist household, and, from the very
early time when I was adjudged old enough to "behave in meeting,"
my Sundays were utterly spoiled for me. I was sent to Sunday-school
at 9 o'clock and kept over for church, which never let out until past
noon. * Then came a hurried lunch at home and a return to church
at 1 o'clock, > and imprisonmentâ for so it seemed to me there until
4 o'clock at least. ;yy yZ . ; â¢ " y

heart/ and finally made up. my mind that when I grew large enough
to settle such matters for myself â¢ I would go to church only when I
chose. That youthful resolution I have cherished and lived up to all
the days of my manhood to the present time. -.;
To my mind much ' of the apparent ; irreligion which Is found
among the descendants of very* strict chrirch people is due to just
this kind of a rebound. â My - family have â¢ always been free to go to
church or not as they choose, and the result Is that they 'like to go,

ALTHOUGH I go to church 1 very rarely I have the greatest
respect for genuine religion wherever it is to be found. "The
clergyman of any denomination who honestly believes what
he preaches and . lives a life *in accord with the sentiments
which :he expresses in his pulpit has my sincere admiration
even if I do not believe in his doctrine. . r-yr-J, ';?;';- :
I believe in religious toleration, not only in the matter of creeds,
but in regard to individuals. The man who does not attend - church
is not necessarily a bad or wicked man, and the man who makes the
greatest outward show of religion may be very unworthy at heart;
to judge a man by the number of times he listens to a sermon during
the year is both foolish and wrong in the extreme.
â -.-â I am religiously inclined myself, but my religion is not of a kind
that seems to need regularly recurring reinforcements. My business
is such that I have very little time to spend away from it, and that
time I do not always care to pass in church. I am persuaded, that
constant church-going would not make me lead any better life nor
impel me to treat my fellow-creatures * any better than I do when I
am living my religion for the most part outside church walls. .
The intolerance which is shown by some church people in regard
to the beliefs of others is not calculated to favorably impress those
who are outside the fold. Take the case of the Mormon, Roberts, for
instance, good, pious people everywhere are up in arms about him,
never seeming to realize that his religionâ strange and wrong as it
seems to usâ ls as much to him, and its forms as binding, as is their
own to, them. The Chinese who prays to his joss, if he prays from
his heart and believing, is entitled.to worship in peace, secure from

Adventures of- a Secret ; Service,: Agent, of the United 'States, Sent to Europe tÂ© Gather Information.
Here ls the story of an American spy in Spain. The secret ser
vice is a branch of the Government of which one hears little, but which
necessarily demands more tact, intelligence, versatility and even brav
ery than is commonly required of officers of the more active departments
concerned in warfare. The usual reward of public praise is also lost to
these brave men by the very reason of the secrecy of their duties, and
in fact the names of many of our best spies during the Spanish war are
unknown to official Washington, because our officials in Spain were au
thorized to accomplish results by men and means at hand, and in many
instances, for purposes of greater secrecy,. reported only results.
The following story of his own adventures was written for The Sun
day Call by John Wilbensen, Baron de. Stampenbourg. a Dane, who was
employed in Spain before and during the war by American agents there.
It speaks for itself. One can only wish that the writer was at liberty to
explain the objects in attaining which he met with the interesting ad
ventures here detailed.
I WAS chosen as a spy with a care
similar in vigilance to that with
which a pugilist is trained and pre
pared for a fight. It. made no dif
ference that I had passed with
honors one of the most' rigid physical
examinations "before my entrance as a
cadet into the royal navy. No; I was
examined over again, and weighed and
measured and tested to suffocation. In
the navy I had learned to handle oar
and helm. The argot and nomenclature
of seafaring men was known to me in
a few languages, and I had acquired a
general, if not thorough, understanding
of things pertaining to ships and the
sea. In the Frederiksberg Mllltarskole
I received the benefit of more than ele
mentary schooling in military tactics;
at the Gruners Handelsakademie I
learned the money making art of the
academically trained business man;
and in the Navigatlonsskolen and the
Sokadetakademiet I had a special
course in astronomy and everything ln
the line of nautical science. My term
at the Kongeligea Universltet in es
thetics, the sciences and the classic
languages, including Icelandic and
Maso-Gothic, finished what I have the
presumption to call my academical edu
cation.
Very well! I came to America more
to study the Indian and to taste a gold
miner's life than for anything else. In
this country I was the recipient Of a
rather dramatic, if rough and ready,
course of practical education. It lasted
for some years, but eventually I bobbed
up serenely and wrote. a letter of my
accomplishments to my father, Its con
tents, I was afterward told, shocked
him from the "top of his crown to the
tip of his toe." In that message I
stated, with a touch of boyish bravado,
that now I could "throw a rope," could
handle the triggerless 48-callber Colt
and could "burst a bronco." I. refrained
from dispatching the additional Infor
mation that I had learned to handle a
raft of. logs, knew how to pick my way
on snowshoes, how to win running
races, etc., for fear of encouraging a
wrong interpretation of what 'I prided
as fine feats, outside of afternoon tea
sipping and what they call fashionable
society.
EXPERIENCES PROVED VALU
ABLE. Vy:.
Still, it is a curious thing to reflect
that I have had some sort of benefit
from nearly everything I learned ln this
way, and from additional sources of
self-teaching, in the spy work that I
was to perform. So when I came, to
Madrid and took up lodging in the new
part of that city, known as Salamanca,
I experienced a feeling of safety such
as a well armed man has a right to feel
in the wilderness. I had been in tight
places before, but never before had I
thought out my Work to such an in
finitesimal fineness of detail.
And f* Â» I felt safe. Safe when the

The secret police" of Spain's capital
might have entered my apartments at
any time without ever,* I believe, suc
ceeding in finding proof against my
neutrality. I brought not a stitch of
clothing, not' an iota of baggage from
America across the Spanish border.
Everything Was bought in Germany,
even my pens and note paper. I hau
no documents or credentials with me of
any kind, for good as these things are
they are sometimes fatal to the bearer
they should protect. But I had a source,
a valued friend in the government ser
vice of a country that is well liked in
Spain, and whenever I was asked for
credentials, outside my passport, 1 gave
his address. A few. flashes across the
wire and the whole thing was ended.
THE CIPHER BOOK.
I entered my observations in a rather
voluminous folio volume, and made not
the least pretense at hiding it. On the
contrary, I sometimes left it open on
my table, so that the "nina" (the girl)
might have a peek into It and.gossip
about it. She was as unlikely to solve
its contents as any expert in orthog
raphy, for it. was written in a cipher of
my own invention. . If there is anything
scientific experts -know little about It is
the possibilities of the runic alphabet,
of the queer hieroglyphic code of which
the ancient Norsemen availed them
selves some two thousand years ago.
Most experts know Sanskrit, all of
them know Greek, and a few of them
know Arabic, but very few Indeed. have
even a smattering appreciation of rune
history., This quaint old code I de
veloped into a system by mlxintr it, ac
cording to my. own: key,' with the lan
guage that is now. spoken in Iceland,

linguistic stew of modern. lcelandic in

I had planned their appearance, and I
was eager* that they should arrest me

a formidable looking bundle under my.

Whether they believed It or ,no I

though one of them lugged away a ba
tata, jor sweet, potato, . for a j clew, I
returned, as I thought,: to. hand over the
batata, but no, it was safely, locked In
the desk of ; his chief. With much mili
tary adroitness and courtesy. he hand
ed me a still more courteous note from
the latter dignitary, in which 1.. was
asked to permit his venerable glance to
dwell for a moment; on, the strange book
reported as' having been j ''discovered,,
at my lodgings.- .*. I sent the man back
with the' book, reminding him that- a'
whole nation of learned men would hold
him responsible for Its loss. I also held
forth a fair potato, saying : ; "Ferdinand
Bandlttot'or whatever your name, an
other- batata, another .clew/; eh'" ' But
the Spaniard smiled and sniffed ana
bowed, and said the book would. do for
a -clew.
. The glance of his chief dwelt on that
book for nearly a Week (this is the
length of the "official moment" in
Spain), or, at least, I heard nothing to
the contrary; in fact, I heard nothing
at all about it. and two letters I wrote
asking its return remained unanswered.
This made me a trifle nervous. Doubt
less the book was passing through the
purgatory- of the united scrutin" of the
best expert minds of Spain, and I began
to wish I had not been so ready 'to ex
pose it.. Through my friend Lieutenant
Co'rrea I obtained an interview with his
father, the admiral, and at the latter's
request the volume was handed back
to me, bearing evidence of the not very
clean hands of those who had been to
work on its contents. In the margin
was written the amusing note, "El ruso

of the campo, I made a specialty of the
fair sex, and through- the gossip of
servants, seamstresses, flower maidens,
old peasant women and young artisan
matrons "I learned even more, of the
true heartbeats of the Spanish people

HOW THE PEOPLE FELT.
The populace and the middle classes
seemed to have great faith in the gov
ernment, but at the mention of Don
Carlos' name every one was on the
guard, and preferred to listen instead
of talking. That is an ominous sign in
Spain, for they are as talkative there
as German fishwives and Parisian poli
ticians. There was present an un
.shaken faith in the invincibility of the
Spanish navy on behalf of these peo
ple, very few of whom had ever seen a
single one of its ships, and, living
in the center of, the country, unfitted
for personal ( obsarvatlon, they take
blindly what the papers give; the pa
persâthree lor a cent â of the "cloaca."
. The blow of defeat, the destruction
of the squadrons of Carvera and Mon
tojo by American gunfire, struck home
with its mightiest force, not .in the
castled circle of the high in power, but
amid the "gente de panuelo," the strug
gling herds of the populace, from whose
forefathers the crew of the invincible
Armada was picked. In this city of the
four winds, of cafes and theaters, but
no cathedral, no factory buildings; in
this inferno of a satanic climate, the
month of July saw the panic of the ig
norant, the misled, the paupers, as they
wept and howled after the defeat, and
. cursed the Government they had so
worshiped as the destroyer of Ameri
can power. Though the press, censor
sh<" In Madrid was the strictest in the
kingdom tÃe truth of the things the
Government was trying to hide leaked
out in some inexplicable way, though
without causing any actual uprising of
the people except as reported by the
papers. â â '.jr.,' -y".:: .
; Had General Toral "resisted to
death," instead of capitulating after
the first storm of Shatter's army,' the
: news of his Inevitable defeat, coming
; at the. very heels of the destruction of
j the Spanish fleet, would have caused a
rebellion/an uprising of the entire peo
ple, if not a revolution. The Carlist
agents were probably better, posted
on American movements and our power
of organization and initiative than any
spy in the kingdom.

fitted up for the same purpose. Several
gunboats were dispatched to overhaul

out the news in time, and Washington
was posted before any of the privateers
left port. The yachts were notified with

also other clews that tended to substan

The Navy "Department of the crown
detailed several special agents to Eng

be quickly secured. I was among the

this move, and through Scandinavian
channels, highly in ' sympathy with
British feeling, I noised it abroad in
Europe simultaneously with forward

out of the difficulty I proposed a sport,
the origin of which I claimed for do
mestic Germany. The wine had flowed
in plenty. The Spanish blood* was up,
and so also was that of the senorltas
present. In less than half an hour all
the young ladies had changed clothes
with the young, Dons. I was so , happy
as to secure the dress of the sobrina
(or niece) of my host, as she was the
damsel I was especially" entertaining.
It was painfully close about the waist,
I remember. In the ensuing excite
ment and hilarity this sport aroused
I saw fit to send a messenger to: my
hotel with orders to ship my things to
Madrid. I had no difficulty in hiding
my freshly shaven face in the beautiful
mantilla that "went with the costume,
so that no one could tell me from a
"real lady." Securing some overclothes
in the vestibule, I watched my chance
and made my exit when no one was
missing me. :"'.:â¢/

standing at the gate. .He looked; om

him in the prettiest of Castilian" voices

to wonder/ as the cab took her away

A couple of days later, as, seated in a
Madrid cafe near the.Mueso del Prado,
I distinguished the approaching of. the
band of the Royal Guards, an austere
looking gentleman, sitting with me at
the same table, almost upset, his; wine
goblet as with a lunging gesture he
burst out: "Maldita sea su alma de
ellosâ Caramba!" (Cursed be their souls
â the devil!) He handed me the paper
with his index finger on a column in
which my Cadiz 'experience was treated
with all the -suspicion and jumped at
conclusions of which only a Spanish
editor is capable. The old gentleman
said something about the special dam
nation to v-hich all American spies
were destined, but, although I leaned
over the taole to better hear what he
said, I had difficulty in understanding
him, for the big, proud band - of the
Spanish crown pulled by the palace
with a power and a zest of ! martial
music that made the' windows tremble.
The triumphant, din of .the "Marcha
Real" smothered the vituperations of
the -old Madridian. We raised our
glasses in unison in a mute viva for
"El Rey" (the King).
My most dangerous work was dur
ing the time that I made Madrid my
headquarters. This was in obedience to
my superiors, and I was instructed to
learn as much as possible regarding the
advices received by the . Government
from General Blanco. " yV
You know the Captain General of
Cuba was at no time cut off from com
munication with the Madrid authorities,
and he was as well in constant touch
with all parts of Cuba, and never even
for a day was without word from Gen
erals Luque and Toral at Santiago. This
was true even when the Americans and
Cubans were supposed to have com
pletely cut off communication. Still, in
Madrid, very little was known regard
ing what was being done in the United
States. The American censorship of
dispatches was very strict, and only re
ports regarding the gathering of great
bodies of volunteers in the South ever
reached Paris and Madrid. Our Govern
ment allowed " such dispatches to go
through for a purpose I suppose.
. One of the dispatches which I secured
in Madrid was that from General
Pando, at Holguin, saying that he was
: about to start with 7000 men to the re
lief of Santiago. This -dispatch was
rushed to Washington, and before Gen
eral Pando began his march, which he
afterward retraced, the American com

THIS romance is like all others
in the beginning, for it began
with love. The strange and un
usual story of an outlaw's bride,
it began with love and found
love's old sad endâ despair, death, even
worse.
It began at the altar and is a pa
thetic tale of a woman's devotion, a
wife's fidelity, whose very wretchedness
grew dear to her in suffering for the
one she loved.
It Is the history of an accomplished
California girl who left a home of
luxury and refinement to become the
wife of a foreman on her father's ranch.
That foreman was Bill Dalton; the
bandit.
It is a story of ceaseless, hopeless
love, and its scenes shift from the pa-*
--rental roof to a peaceful valley home
In Southern California; to a court of
Justice, where the wife waited hours,
days and months for the jury's verdict;
to the prison, whose doors opened at
last only to admit him to the world
whose doors had closed; to that death
in life, the civil quarantine, from which
no outlaw who has a price upon hi.<
head ever escapes; and finally to a
solitary grave in a barren, desolate field
of her girlhood home, where with her
father's little ones she burled ' that
which the law did not demandâ th_
body of her dead.
Mrs. Dalton was the Idolized and
gifted daughter of a prominent Merced
County rancher. All that love and all
that wealth could give had been lav
ished upon her from childhood; and
when she left this home of plenty to
share the vicissitudes of fate with one
she loved, frugality had no terror,-? for
her. Life was but a glorious promise
of that perfect home that was to be.
They started their new life of con
tentment and hope together on a little
ranch in San Luis Obispo County.
Bill Dalton was a graduate of a Ken
tucky university and had come West
to outlive a name already made no
torious by his bandit brothers; to out
live a name and throw off the shackles
of heritage, for he was a cousin of the
James brothers. He was the seventh
son of a family of fifteen, and deter
mined to lead the life of an honest man,
despite the associations of his kindred.
He felt secure in the peaceful valley
home, surrounded by purple mountains
and filled with the love and devotion
of a good, true woman. He was strong,
and united industry with science in the
cultivation of the soil; she, the tender
wife, became a fond mother, and both
of them loved that cozy nest and
dreamed of the day when by labor and
economy they could pay for this little
home and possess it as their very own.
Fortune favored them at first. He
was willing to work overtime, and
helped the neighbors with their plow
ing;, and she saved the proceeds from
poultry and dairy and helped the neigh
bors with their sewing. The money
thus gained was applied to the fund
for the purchase of that home. Yeai
after year they saved and hoped and
tolled, little dreaming that a shadow
was to darken the prospect of their
lives; that it was even then waiting at
the door.
His brothers came to California, leav
ing their old field of criminal opera
tions for pastures. new; came unbidden
and red handed from the robbery of
the express; came to this cozy home for
refuge from the hands of the law.
They were given shelterâ even more,
for Bill Dalton helped his brothers to
escape. | * He went with them until they
were safe beyond the borders of the
State,' safe from the clutches of the
law. This he did for his brothers.
Would any man do less?
It was his first offense, this kindness
to his own. It was the beginning of
the end. He assisted his brothers to
escape, but his solicitude cost him dear.
He was absent just two weeks, and
the neighbors did not greet him -kindly
when he returned. . â¢ .--, y
That feeling for his brothers cost him
the trust of friends and neighbors, his
liberty, and eventually his life; but
whatever it cost him, it could not de
prive him of his wife's love and fidelity.
That was his to the last.
He was arrested on suspicion
they could .not' find his : brothers, and
so they arrested him. He was released
after a while, only to 'be thrown back
in jail upon other charges.
These . court - proceedings continued
one year. In the meantime farming im
plements, household furniture and the
stockâ a wedding present from her fa
therâhad been. sold at a sacrifice to
pay the lawyer's fees. Nothing was
left. The earnest hopes they had set
their hearts upon: had turned to ashes.
When his trial was ended and he
came forth a free man, he found every
man his enemy and one woman his
friend. -
He went East on a visit to his moth
er, leaving his wife and children here,
with her brother, until he should pre
pare a home for them In a new country.
Now for the strangest and most dra
matic career that ever befell a Cali
fornia girl, the history of a woman who
followed her husband into exile; pur
sued night and day; banished from
home by her fidelity to the bonds that
no man can put asunder; fleeing from
justice that knows but one end, the
price of a human life â this, and more,
Mrs. Dalton experienced because of
Something of her unusual life is best
told by â¢ the woman who . suffered , it.
"If I had but known the life he in
tended to follow when he sent for me
to join him I would have remained
here, not because I did not love him,
but because of that love, which I knew
would Have brought him back to us
some day. He was devoted to the chil
dren, kind and indulgent, and I shall
always believe that this love would
have redeemed him from the past if I
had refused to leave California; but, of
course, I did not know. '* V T
"I joined him at his mother's home
in Kingfisher, Oklahoma Territory. It
was here that I first learned of his in
tention to lead an outlaw's life. When
the trouble began I think I suffered
most. I was unacquainted with grief
then, and for the first time in my mar
ried life I was ! left alone with the chil
drenleft alone, while Mr. Dalton set
out upon the uncertain journey to help
his brothers to escape from the State.
He was gone two weeks, and it seemed
two years to me. I walked the floor
night and day in the anguish of antici
pation. Perhaps he was dead, perhaps
wounded or taken prisoner along with
his brothers.
"When the neighbors called I had to
entertain them with smiles and light
words while my heart was breaking.
They were not to know why he was ab
sent. I could not write home about my
trouble, for I had not pleased my
parents in my choice of a husband, and
my pride kept me from seeking their
consolation.
"Misery needs no calendar, but dur
ing the last year of my married life I
measured time by heart-throbs. !
"We' started on our journey from
civilization at Kingfisher, a party of
seven adults and four children. Three
of the men had their wives with them.
We traveled in two covered wagons
through the trackless wilderness of
Oklahoma and Indian Territories, our
destination nowhere and our desire
anywhere to avoid the man-hunters,
for each man in our party had a price
upon his head.
"Sometimes we pushed on and on,
traveling night and day and in fear
of pursuit. O, God! the eternal memory
of those horrible hours haunts me now.
The wretchedness of the flrst night's
camp is a thing apart in its Intensity
from all my other trials. We suspected
that we were being followed, and so
camped that night without a fire and
without sleep. The plaintive cries of
the wildcat, the rattling leaves stirred
by lizards or snakes, would have been
enough to dispel all thoughts of slum
ber; but the soul-stirring fear that the
sun might rise over the dead bodies of
our loved ones kept us awake.
"After that night we women took
turns as sentinels, for the men always
returned at evening exhausted from
their long day's tramp, hunting for
game and new roads that were safe to
travel. The first time I took my turn
in guarding the sleepers I was nearly
wild with apprehension. I had been
staring into the deep forest until I
Imagined every light spot a human face
and every tree trunk a body. If a twig
broke or a leaf fell my ears magnified
the sound and my eyes were constantly
on the alert for some treacherous foe.
The moon was full and the shadows
from the pines played ghastly tricks
with my imagination.
"I .was very nearly distracted with
nervous fears, and with no intention of
firing I reached for my gun, thinking
to while away a moment ln taking a
quiet aim at a tree some fifty yards
away. 'I-, raised my gun to take aim
and saw what made my blood curdle
in my veins; the figure of an Indian
at whom â¢ I had unconsciously leveled
my gun! I was dumb with terror and
the Indian gave the first alarm by, a
peculiar cry that awakened my hus
band. Ââ â¢-.*â¢
"In an instant he was by the Indian's
side. It was 'Indian Jake,* a friend,
who brought us news that we were pur
sued by a party not seven miles away.
We broke camp immediately in the
dead of night and resumed our tiresome
journey, broken- of rest and disturbed
by dangers. This Indian had warned
Mr. Dalton time after time, because he
had once saved his life when dying
from starvation. .
"It was a terrible life, this roving,
fleeing existence. The men themselves
felt no safety, but tried to keep their
fears from the women. I never knew
one of them to have a sound night's
sleep during the whole of that madden
ing career. ', - y

John Hays Hammond was then con

were "expected to tear, a hole right
through the mass and smash everything.
The whole camp was armed. to the teeth.
Every man carried, at least one revolver
and expected to use it, for It was a fight
for big stakes, and each company prom
ised protection to its men. â¢ There was
practically no danger of arrest, however,

In Johannesburg, great or small, took a
vital â 'â : interest in the struggle, and put
forth every effort to gain the prize. Each
company hoped to push their man up
to the window purchase the license,
hand it to an armed rider and hurry lt
off to the farm, where the engineers and
peggers were waiting to Jump in and
stake off the richest claims.
Six firms even went so far as to sink
strong wooden posts just by the window
and to these lashed men with ropes, so
that they could not be pulled away and
passed back over the crowd. But these
precautions availed nothing, for when the
struggle began sharp knives severed the
thongs and both men and posts landed
on the outskirts of the crowd.
Personally, Brown was not formidable.
With five feet eight Inches of height and
smooth, boyish countenance, he was not
a dangerous looking man. But those who
had seen him glance down the barrel of
a 45-Colt without so much as moving an
eyelid knew him as absolutely fearless.
Brown, while he associated with the bet
ter class of Americans on the Rand, was
on speaking terms with the rough element
and he utilized these to form a flying
wedge, which at that time had just been
developed by the American football play
ers.
To get all these men under one flag he
hired the seven most desperate characters
on the Randâ Love. Jim and Jack
Maloney. Manny Garchel, "Butch" "Wil

Brown found that the only way to hold
his men was to keep them drunk, so for
five days previous to the opening/whisky
flowed like water and the ringleaders
boosted up their cohorts with bad liquor.
On the day of the rush, however, no
man was so drunk as to forget about the
flying wedge, which had been thoroughly
explained and Illustrated. At the very
peep of the dawn the great mass began to
push, though the sale was not until 9
o'clock. Lines were formed and the en
tire gathering, was i soon engaged in a
vicious free fight. Men emerged with
ears bitten â . off, eyes blackened, noses
broken and teeth loosened. As soon as a
company, got its man to the window he
was .dragged away and either passed
overhead or nearly trampled to death.
Many succeeded in reaching the spot, but
it was Impossible to hold a man' there
long, for he was soon borne down by
force of numbers. '"â¢'â â  ,
5 Brown and his henchmen, In the mean
time,. held their position on the outskirts.
It was not until half an hour before the
time: appointed to open the window that
he began to form his wedge. ..Probably
6000 men were massed between him and
the goal at that. moment, but this never
feazed the indomitable Yankee. -With
thongs of- rawhide he lashed himself to
Alec Love and Jim : Maloney, and with his
feet barely touching the earth, gave the
signal to move. V:-"y . > - ;
At the first impact with the human wall
there was a terrific howl of pain* follow
ed by the most surpassing imprecations,
and a man staggered out of the crowd
with the blood spurting from his leg. 'Ma
loney had run his knife into him several
inches. ( In a few minutes these cries
echoed on all sides and the attention '.of
the mob became divided, some turning to
face the wedge, which hung together
without a break and seemed to . gain in
velocity as it neared the goal. Maloney
and Love, with heads down, darted into
every opening, and where there was none,
made it with the jab of a knife. Brown
was* hustled along breathless and bleed
ing until within a dozen rods of the win
dow, yy'
Here several hundred Cornlshmen, great
hulking fellows, with plenty of strength
and grit, made a stand that bade fair to
spoil the rush. They smashed the , apex
and were mowing down the pugilists
when the rest of the wedge broke
through and cleared the way. Brown,
though badly bruised, continued to shout
out promises of reward to his men if they
pushed him up on time. There were but
a few minutes left then, and the office
was rocking to and fro with the tide of
humanity.
Â Pounded and beaten on every side the
great flying wedge made one last .effort,
and with, a -zigzag movement arid many
knife thrusts, finally broke through and
fairly hurled Brown against the office.
With a good right-hand blow a pugilist
smashed in the window and Brown
clutched the frail partition with a death
grip. At the some moment a gun was
fired, announcing 9 o'clock, and the whole
mass, as one man, heaved up against the
little galvanized Iron booth, crushing
Brown almost flat.
Surrounded by a remnant of his flying
wedge,- however, he continued to hang to
the window, and was Just getting at his
wad of five-pound notes when the Govern
ment Commissioner threw open the door
and announced President Kruger's order
suspending the opening. It nearly cost
him his life,, for bullets rained in the
shanty from all sides and the mob push
ed harder than ever, and Brown was on
the point of giving up his position when
one of those happy Inspirations which oc-
cur to men of quick thought and action
urged him to demand a license.
"Here I am," he yelled at the fright
ened commissioner, sticking through the
window a face covered with " blood,
"here's my good, hard-earned money.
Now give me. my license, or I'll sue the
Government for Â£1,000.000."
A sudden pitch of the mob nearly
pushed the plucky*, fellow through the
window and shattered his shoulder
blade, but he waited to hear â â¢' the re
fusal and have witnessed, and then al
lowed himself to be passed out on* the

was being tried, and It. passed through

"Outgrew Jewish Comment,FRANCE has a new submarine
torpedo boat that is said to be a
wonder of her class. What she
has done is far in advance of
any submarine boat ever built
and her inventor says he only wants a
fighting chance to show Just what
there is in his craft.
The new boat is called the Gustave
Zede, after the name of her inventor,
and she has iiany novel points in con
struction of boats of this kind. She
differs from our own boatâ Hol
landâprincipally in being much larger
and more tapering in the form of hull.
She is 131 feet long and has a dis
placement of 266 tons.
After making due allowance for the
enthusiasm of Frenchmen at possess
ing a craft that cannot be duplicated
in the world, there Is i. denying that
the Gustave Zede is a wonderful ves
sel and even if she only does one-half
of what is claimed for her she will
make a most formidable enemy.
All the reports concerning the new
boat indicate that it is a step in ad
vance in submarine navigation. It
not only navigates the depths with
safety and discharges its torpedoes
with accuracy, but it is provided with
an artificial electric "eye," whereby it
can produce light fo great distances
benefeth the water.
Using dummy torpedoes this boat has
struck a battleship going at full speed
without giving her a chance to defend
herself. This is the first time such a
feat has been performed by a sub
marine boat. _m9m\_
Gustave Zede, the Inventor, was for
many years naval constructor and his
ideas are certainly worthy of the
greatest consideration. He, lt is
claimed, was the first inventor to ap
ply the electric motor to submarine
locomotion. The n.otor undergoes no
loss of weight during its operation, re
quires no. oxygen, disengages no gas,
end is consequently well adapted to
TREMENDOUS LIFTING POWER OF ORDINARY GARDEN VEGETABLES.
Special to The Sunday Call.
EXPERIMENTS have Just demon
strated that one of the most
amazing things in nature is the
lifting power possessed by a
â¢ growing plant. Science, which
thought it knew a few things about
nature's forces, has been startled to
find that such an insignificant, com
mon-place vegetable as a squash is
capable of elevating a 5000. pound
weight by the mere force of its re
sistless living power of expansion.
Given the requisite number of these
products of nature and the squash could
elevate a modern sky-scraper or rend
a rock. *yV"I

navigation under water. The draw
back of the storage batteries' lack of
endurance is claimed to have been over
come, but just how is a secret the in
ventor guards carefully.'
No naval expert of any foreign coun
try has ever seen the working of- the
â¢wonderful new torpedo boat, and no
body except the inventor and the crew
has ever seen the inside of the vessel.
But judging by her performances and
the. general working of her machinery
there can be little doubt but that the
general plan of our own Holland boat
has been adhered to.
The Gustave Zede was tested during
the recent maneuvers at Toulon. The
captain of the battle-ship Magenta de
clared that he could defend himself
against, any submarine boat. The Zede
disappeared under water and went for'
him. yy,c<p^y ;yvy>: :_'â¢'.-..- â  '-J';?; â¢.'.â '
The Magenta was lying quietly at an- .
chor, ' when, T bump!* came a .orpedo
against her -bottom**" The " captain ~ had i
no idea of his danger. y
The inventor of the Zede then prom
ised that he would hit the Magenta
when she was going at full speed. This
promise he also carried out.
The Zede's motors exert so mv.eh
power that, when going at full speed,
she makes a considerable eddy on the
surface of the water; but this is not
perceptible in a rough sea: and disap
pears when the speed is reduced.
When the Zede was first built her
crew was unable to see under water,
but since then a wonderful eye has been
added to her whereby they can see
ahead of them for a hundred yards or
more. This "in the invention of two
young lieutenants. -/.^y^./:'.'
Two things make it difficult to see far
under waterâ the density, and the ob
scurity of the water. Of course if the
water is very muddy it is impossible to
see at all, but in any case- the density
of it and the salts in it make it impos
sible to see far. The eye of the Zede
which overcomes this obstruction con
sists of an electric light surrounded by
very powerful refracting lenses. These
are similar in construction to the lenses
of a lighthouse lantern. The strength

world were conducted by Charles H.
Ames at the Massachusetts Agricul
tural College, Amherst. The attention
of the president of . the college, W. S.
Clark, was directed to the matter and
he,* together with other gentlemen in
terested in opening up new pathways
to knowledge, made further experi
ments., A squash was procured and a
harness constructed on such principles
as would enable the plant to exert to
the utmost its lifting powers. In de
scribing the. preliminary experiments
and the theories on which they based
their plans Mr. Clark says: *l > :
"The ' following considerations sug
gested the idea:

of these lenses may be judged from the
fact that if the sun were permitted to
shine straight through - them it would
burn and melt up everything in the
lighthouse.
This powerful light, has been placed
in a conning tower and is almost like
the illuminating power of the Holland.
How long this fierce light can be main
tained has not been stated in the re
ports received, but the chances are that
it is only to be used immediately be
fore an attack is made for the pur
pose of accurately locating the foe.
For offensive purposes there are
two torpedo tubes in the Zede. These
are placed one on . either side. This
seems an almost impossible armament,
but the inventors claim that below the
surface it Is just right and that it real
ly helps to balance the boat.
The immersion of the boat Is regu
lated by the simple action of horizontal
rudders analogous to those of the
Whitehead torpedo. Everything is done
by electricity. The motor is extremely
light. It actuates the screw directly
without gearing and communicates to
it a velocity of 200 revolutions. The
current that supplies the motor is fur-

fooled Tebeau on an out curve and Pat
was hot. I* saw by the expression of his
face that he wanted to turn a trick, so I
kept my blinkers open for I was certain
that something was going to happen.
Sure enough; Pond sent in a slow curve
that broke very quickly just in front of
the plate. .Tebeau' had edged up as far
toward the. front and end of the. batters'

j broke he deliberately stepped out of the
box and kissed it. My, but it was a drive

"Having never heard of any attempt
to measure the expansive force of a
growing plant, we determined to exper
iment in this direction.
"At first we thought of trying the ex
pansive . force of some small, hard,
green fruit, such as . hickory nut or a
near, but the expansion was so slow
and the attachment of ; the fruit to the
tree so fragile that the idea was aban
doned. The squash, growing on the
ground, great rapidity, and to an
enormous size, seemed on the whole the
best fruit for the experiment.
"Accordingly, seeds of the mammoth
yellow Chile having been obtained, they
were planted in the propagating pits of
the plant house, where the temperature
and moisture could be easily controlled.
Way out into. deep center the ball sailed
and struck the fence. Childs and the oth
er player came home, tying the score, but
' Brodie got the ball 1 back so quickly that
Tebeau was held at second base. ..The
crowd was wild. The noise was deafen
ing. I turned around as soon as I saw Te

Orioles with his mask off shouting blue
murder. Imagine how ,I..felt. I knew
what I had to do. so with the easiest
manner and my. most annoying smile I
called Tebeau out for stepping out of. the
box. I had offered up a silent prayer, for I
never expected to see mother again, when,
what, to my eternal astonishment, should
happen but Tebeau- left the base without
kicking. He had tried to turn a trick and
failed, but he was man enough to take
his medicine. ;/ :'-:/.^:/
â¢ Well, all of the Baltimore correspond
ents who were along with the team gave
me the glad hand, with the result that
when Cleveland went to Baltimore they
asked Nick Young to have me umpire the
series, so I was ordered to go there. I
shall never forget that first game. When
I came on the field I was given a rousing
reception as a result of my work in Cleve- 1
land. 1 did not pay any attention to the .
bouquets, for long experience had taught
me how little it takes to make a crowd â 
of rooters change their opinion of a man.
The first game of that series justified my
mental conclusions, for all of the papers
roasted the life out of me the next morn

recovered the ball and got It over to first.
It was a close decision, but Burkett.was
safe, which made it an error for Jen

depth. Here, under the fostering care
of Prof. Maynard, the seeds germinat
ed, the vine grew vigorously, and the
squash lifted in a most satisfactory
manner." r-r _-. y.r .'.-:..
The experiment was watched day and
night by relays of ' the scientists in
terested. An ingeniously constructed
apparatus for testing the lifting power
of the plant consisted of a frame of
seven-inch boards.; In this framework
the harnessed squash was deposited,
the harness consisting of iron straps
completely encircling the. squash. To
the harness wajp . attached a lever, on
which were placed the weights to meas

ble. As the growing : squash elevated
the weights/others were added/ A care

who was captain of the team '"that day,

game," he started In from center . a
racing yacht under full- sail. i I- saw him
coming, so I went out to meet him. "You

Kelly," I said, "for if you" come In any
further you will have to go all the way
in." yy: . - yr . â â ; -..;:â¢ â 
This set him on fire and he came at
me like a Kansas cyclone. He threatened
to throw me over the fence, but I asked
him to take a $25 fine and made him join
Jennings on the bench, where I expressed
the wish that he would enjoy the game.
You can imagine how the crowd was
howling by this time.- I can never forget
the scene. The Baltimore players ' were
wild. Next Brodie came to me, but I
presented him with seven idle days and
begged him to join the bunch ' on the
bench. I thought that I had flnshed. but
"Mugsy" McGraw on third base Could not
stand it, so he exploded and fired himself
at me like a skyrocket. I took all of the
chesty out of him in a. minute, and before
he knew where he was at he had a fine
and a nice seat on the bench. This rapid
work took the wind out of the sails of the
Baltimores. I told them;. that I. was
master and that I would put the entire
team on the bench if necessary to preserve |
order. They seemed to 7 realize it, and
there was no more kicking. Of ' course,
Cleveland won that game.'but for the rest
of the series I had perfect obedience.
The chief difference between umpiring
a ball game and refereelng a light la : that
when you are In the ring you have only
two, men to watch. In a prize-fight/ as in
a ball game, I am always on the lookout l
for what no one else ever sees. In the
ring I always stand within V ree feet of
'my men. I keep constantly circling around
them, watching every movement and
studying their temperaments. By being
so close I can at the very first semblance
of a clinch make the men break, and not
give one of them a chance to do any close
punching, as is so often done when the
referee stands in the corner of the ring.
A referee, of course, knows the rules, and
he must also be perfectly familiar with
the articles of agreement under which the
men are fighting. y, .

keep your eyes on more men. This, of
course,' is more difficult, especially when
all 'of them are trying to turn a trick. I
. make a close study .of every man, and
above all I : never r take my eyes off the
ball, for as long as I follow it I have the
game: where I can render any decision.
No play can be made without the ball.
This, is the main thing for an umpire to
remember. â " *." r \ '-, ,
From long experience I can tell when
the ball is coping in to the batter just
where it will go if he hits it. This is a
great help to me; and then, again, on
close plays at first- base when I am behind
the plate I always run out toward the
pitcher, for the reason that I have a
clearer view of the baseman and runner
at the same time, which is not the case if
I follow the runner down the line, as ao
many umpires do.
It does not take me long to catch on to
the signs of a team, and this is of great
help, especially when a runner is going
to try for a stolen base, as it gives me
the opportunity of being prepared to get
down myself. In a ball game the man
that requires the most watching is the
batter. If he is an old hand at the busi
ness he can make the catcher's life mis
erable. ' * .
There are many things and points that
come to a man of long experience, and it
is these same points that he -alone sees
and that so often provoke a howl from
the spectators simply because, they over
look them or do not want to see them.

THE RIDE THAT SAVED THE CAMP
NASON FI-OYD stood on the stoep of his store talking to the native
chief, Umsikilaki, or rather listening with all his ears to what
that worthy v.. saying. His face grew very grave as the minutes
dragged on. Presently his wife, who had been standing at the
dooi of the house anxiously scanning his changing expression,
came across to him, and linking her arm affectionately through
his, asked: â -'*..;'
"What is It. dear? Is it bad news? The Basutos?"
Nason looked at his wife tenderly, and nodded, patting her hand, how
ever, the while as If to reassure her. Tbe three made a characteristic pic
ture of South African life, as they stood there chatting in the sunlight.
Anna Floyd was approaching her fiftieth year, but her hair was as
golden, her cheeks as soft and delicately rosy, her voice as gentle and lov
ing and tender as when, thirty years ago. her husband, then a sergeant ln
the Seymour Troopers, had told her she reminded him of the roses' that
blew in. the hedge rows of his native England. Nason Floyd was ten years
older than his wife. His close-cropped hair was gray, like his mustache,
but with that respectable grizzled look that suggests the soldier and hard
service.
msikilaki was a fine specimen of a Hluba savage sturdy, erect
as an assegai. He had ever since Floyd's arrival in the Mandileni Valley'
6ome six years previously been a warm and true ally to the trader.' And
now he brought the news so long and anxiously dreaded that a Basuto
imp! had gone off to Mount Frere, and that Floyd himself might at any
hour expect his stole to be looted.
"What do you think, mother?" asked Floyd. "Had we better cut and
run, or put up the barricades and wait for the troops? We have heaps of
ammunition, if only old Omsi here will lend us some men."
'But there's Loo. dear," murmured the mother, while her hand tight
ened on her husband's arm. "Thank God. the other girls are in Durban."
'Oh, Loo's all right." said Floyd, cheerfully, his eyes sparkling. "She
Is a perfect nailer with a rifle. Aren't you, Loo?" he shouted, as round the
hut danced a girl.
. "Aren't I what?" was the rejoinder, as careless of grammar as of cor
rection, as she came forward and linked on to her mother, looking up at
her lovingly as she whispered, "You groat fat old darling!"
"What was your last score at 400. Loo?" asked Flovd.
"Two magpies, three bulls, one outsider andâ a sighter," said Loo, de
murely. She always called a miss a sighter. "But why?" she asked,
quickly, noticing for the first time the air of gravity that overhung the
group. Â»
"Because we are discussing, little woman, whether to go before the
Basutos get here or to wait and stand a siege."
"Oh, do let's have the siege,'.' rejoined Loo, breathlessly, her face radi
ant with excitement. And a very piquant, irresistible face it was. Very
fair In complexion, with riotous curly golden hair that utterly contemned
all bonds, her features resembled her father's, blending' with an indescrib
able charm and suggestion of womanliness and tenderness a look of firm
ness, endurance arid pride. â 1
And, Indeed. Loo Floyd was also a household name for many a mile
beyond. She was one of the Veld's diamonds, a flawless stone, steeped
through and through with sunshine, and radiating it again on all sides in
unconscious sheer delight of living.
She disappeared now Into the store to reappear again in a few mo
ments with a bandolier over her white cotton frock, and a rifle brandished
in her handâ with which she marched up and down the stoep, to the huge
delight of the natives.
-"Now, then. Loo," said her father, "if you want to fight, get to work
and stow all fooling. Go round and get the girls to send all the water into
the store. And you," he said, turning to his assistants, the two Macraes,
"go and get the wagons into the laager round the 'nouses, and run the
sheathing over the thatches. You might get everything ready, mother,
for a move into the store, if that is to be necessary. I wish I could send
into Scanlan. But that, of course, is impossible now. I'd give anything
to warn him." .* . . . â  : : "
As the party breaks up to fulfill his directions. Floyd surveys the scene
in front of him. So. beautiful. bo intensely restful Is it. lt seems almost
ludicrous to be preparing for the hubbub of war. Mile after mile the plain
stretches out in front, green with the lambent flash of the young grass
shooting through the rustling, rolling gold of last year's dying growth.
To right and left, to back and from, rise tier on tier "the mighty hills For
Mandileni is one of the real treasure haunts of South Africaâ a peaceful
valley, lying hushed and dream-woven between the arms of the grim and
barren Drakensb There in front, mass on mass of granite, the Dra
kensberg Range seeks the sky, Its slopes as well as its peaks white and
glittering with snow. All round as far as the eve can see is that white
line, like a fringe of foaming lace dropped from the sky on ridge arid
rounded kopje, softening the sharp edges of ravine and donga and
mantling with mighty Icicles the gaunt faces of giant kraazes. And be
yond the snow lay the crystal bright sky. brilliant, bracing, full of breath
and crisp, keen grasp of life.-. Up above the intense, gleaming, deepening
fathomless blue, and below that waving, rolling gold of the Veld flecked
with the lambent green of young grasses running right up to the very
fringe of the snow, and the sun shining full in midheavenâ gentle
coaxing as a June day in England. '
"How like a dream it all seems," thought Floyd, as his thoughts went
off to his quondam friend.
Morris Scanlan was the magistrate nt Mount Frere. and*an Irishman
He was a young man. and added all the haste of youth to the natural
heritage of a Celtic temper. But he was eertainlv attractive. Tall with
that lissom, agile build so distinctive of the Irish, he had lived a' wild
roving life on the Veld, and was full of anecdote, and a humor nerhanq
occasionally over-grim. His bright blue eyes and yellow hair and beard
contrasted keenly with the dark tan of his complexion. But his face was
absorbing, powerful with that power that only comes of experience In re
straint.
From the flrst moment Morris Scanlan had seen Loo ho had fallen in
love with her. That had been two years before, on his arrival at Mount
Frere, and when Loo Floyd was but IC years old. Both Floyd and his wife
took to him at once, and when a month later he boldly proposed to carry
BIG WINNINGS ON THE TURF.
PEBHAPS the biggest winning ever
made on the English turf by an in
dividual in recent years is credited
to young Fuiton, an ironmaster of
Belfast, who cleaned up Â£106,000
when Cdmedy won the Cambridgeshire In
1882. Comedy was plunged on through the
simultaneous commission system, . and,
opening at odds of CO to 1, Mr. Fulton's
men kept betting until the bookmakers
had all they wanted.
The most noted coup engineered by
John McCaffertyâ and he has a habit of
"uncorking good things"â was when he
brought Queenie Trowbridge to Mon
mouth Park in July. 1892.
Queenie was a Webster filly, by Al
mlnde-Ada Lambert. In her two-year-old
form she had won the Liberty stakes In
Nashville. Her dam, Ada Lambert, was a
good mare.
There was no clear reason why Queenie
Trowbridge should be rated as a 100 to: 1
shot, but that is just what she was quoted
at in the last race at Monmouth on July
9, 1892. The story of the methods adopted
by McCafferty and his associates to get
their money down is an oft-told tale.
There were about a dozen men at the
track who acted as if they, had never
been on a racetrack before. When the
betting began in the Trowbridge race
these "hayseeds" wandered into the bet
ting ring and stared at the blackboards.
With apparently the utmost recklessness
they began betting on Queenie Trow
bridge in wads of $2 and $3. The book
makers took the change, and many of
them facetiously remarked: "Here's a lit
tle supper money."
Later, when these farmer looking chaps
all appeared to fancy Trowbridge and
off their daughter,' subject to the stipulation of waiting- till she was older,
they- had no objection to offer. - - ' -
When Scanlan came to approach. Loo on the subject - there â  was about
her so disconcerting an innocence of the slightest embarrassment that he
found his task more difficult even than he had anticipated. Of sighs, of
tenderness, of amatory innuendoes she was serenely oblivious, continuing
with avidity her occupation of eating strawberries. Now, it is not easy
even for an Irishman to make love to a girl of 16 intent on berries,
bo that when at last Morris screwed- up his courage to the point of gasp
ing out his declaration,- he felt savagely that it. was a very lame proceed
ing. To make matters more sore. Loo had accepted it in a spirit of hilari
ous surprise, of girlish glee, whose very freedom from any shyness-de
clared her heart as yet unreached. But she liked Morris, liked him. very
much, and she accepted the idea of becoming his wife with an outburst of
gratitude and devotion at once as careless and as rapturous as though she
had received a present of a new horse. - < . - y
"Won't It be ripping?" she had said to him, as she danced away up to
the house, dragging him along with both hands. "Shall I live at the Resi
dency? And may I come to the court and sit up by you when you try the
prisoners? What glorious fun we shall have, sha'n't we?" And so she had
rattled on, baffling poor Morris between the desire to kiss her into silence,
and comprehension, and the knowledge that he must wait a while till the
years unfolded further the bud of her womanhood. â¢ So* it was a kind of
unspoken engagement that had arisen and continued to exist between the
two for over eighteen months. Â«â¢ -. - " ' ~ " '"" '.
But a few months previously," when Floyd and his family were spending
a few days at Mount Frere. an incident had occurred which' had* created
a violent quarrel between Scanlan and his guest. Nason had brought, with
him a dogâ valued and faithful houndâ that insisted on accompanying
Its master, everywhere. To all dogs Scanlan had a morbid aversion. For,
like many Irishmen who have lived lonely and wandering lives, he had in
him a kind of superstition- soured by. an alien cynicism. Indeed, except. In
his genuinely gay moments. Morris was a moody kind of a man, Intensely
suspicious of Intended affronts, unforgiving, bitter and inclined to jibeâ
and yet, in spite of all that, very lovable, for somehow, however nasty
he might be. you always felt that deep down there was a great sensitive
soul hiding wounds the world had made. ... * r.
Scanlan'a particular superstition- was that his banshee took the form
of a dog, which, when it wanted to express itself, did so by the aggravating
process of howling at night under his window. As bad luck would have it.
for two nights before the arrival of the Floyds at the Residency, Scanlan
had been disturbed by this howling, and had been convinced it was. a
banshee foretelling dÂ»*-tk or disaster by the. fact that he had been unable
either to see the dog at the time or trace its spoor in the morning. But
about midnight, after the. Floyds' arrival, the howling had commenced
again, and Scanlan with his gun liad again set out to seek proof, and this
time to find sitting in the moonlight a great yellow cur with its jowl turn
ing skyward in a dreary wail. "You brute!'' he had muttered, and next
moment a shot had rung out and the dog had howled Its last. - ;.
But in the morning, when Floyd discovered that his faithful friend
had been so wantonly slaughtered by his host, he would accept neither
apology nor excuseâ but Immediately called his wife and daughter, and
without further parley left the astounded and penitent magistrate gaping
over his gate at the retreating figures of his guests. y_
But if the quarrel seemed for the moment to sever once and for all all
chance of more intimate alliance between the two families, aa a matter
of fact it brought that chance nearer the realm of realization than it had
ever been before. For with the sudden task of self-questioning it set to
Loo, it brought an answer that had flushed her rosy cheeks with a car
nation called forth by no exercise, an answer that had brought a new light
to the lovely eyes, a new meaning to the lips that the same evening fal
tered'their anxious questions to her mother. But in spite of maternal
comforting, the quarrel did remain. And though Floyd had long ago now
forgiven the act. he would not be the first to hold out the hand. . -
"No." he would - say, "the bounder would think 1 am throwing Loo
at him." . And Scanlan, like most Colts, being as obstinate as a pig when
his pride was concerned, declined to stretch out twice a hand once re
fused. â "â¢â ' â  . , _;
Thus it was that Floyd found himself thinking now how the Basuto
imp! would find his friend prepared. For Mount Frere was practically do
serted by all save the trader and the magistrate. The Basuto scare bad
driven the few Inhabitants to flee Into tho fortified township of N'Taban
kula, across the Pondo border. Scanlan. indeed, was the object of the
rising, his decision as to a question of boundary having been the imme
diate brand to light long-smoldering elements of revolt. Floyd knew that
it was lust Morris' stubbornness that caused him to remain at his post,
instead of retiring, to return with the military. â 
He looked wistfully now toward the Devil's Cut, a groat angular ' V
in the mountain, whore ran the little pass to. Mount Frere. He would give
anything, he felt, to bo able to dash in and bring the magistrate back with
him. His face lightened up as be thought of it. .He was on the point of
calling to his wife when T'msikilaki touched his elbow and pointed with, his
assegai to the plain In front. . â - -'
The homestead at Mandileni. was such as might be seen in many, parts
of Africa, as far as concerns the disposition of its mere externals. A low
wall of mud sods Inclosing In almost a square about an acre of land, and
backed on the south and east by a triple row of black wattle and euca
lyptus. In the center of this area four or five large huts, grouped together,
constituted the dwelling rooms. Built of dabge. round: thatched .with reed,
with deep, overhanging eaves and small windows, they presented a pic
turesque contrast to the ungainly architectural pioneer, of civilization
which, in the shape of a "tin shop." reared its ugly, corrugated iron head
above them. For this "tin shop," as Floyd called -was of brick and
<ron roofed with the corrugated stuff so much used in the colonies. It
was.a rectangular building.'. with a stone stoep in front, a wool-pack. ng
shed in the rear, with Its gable ends abutting, one on the dwelling houses,
the other on a small hut used as a spare guest room. Beyond this last
again was the stone cattle kraal, wherein some twenty draught* oxen,
fine black brutes, with huge horns, were now, moving to and fro in that
aimless aggravating wav which seems to possess cattle when .kraaled.
Between the store and the low sod wall was a tennis court of gravel,
across which the net was still slung; for Loo Is the champion tennis player
of that part of the Transkil. Between the larger of the dwelling huts
and the store was a passage built of solid logs, and loop-holed. Through
thi** the girls were now engaged In rolling small casks of water as fast as
they could bo filled from the huge tank outside. Others. , under. Mrs
Floyd's directions, were transferring into the larger hut the contents of
the pantry and the kitchen, which lay some way down toward the southern
al At the moment when Vmsikilaki called the attention of Floyd to the
distant Veld, every one seemed busy as possible, and the two Macraes
came up with flushed faces and pointed to their work. Of this Floyd was
particular*' proud It being his own idea. It consisted simply of four long
pieces of corrugated Iron which, when fitted on and clamped together,
formed a perfect sheath over the thatch of each hut. thus forming a fire
screen against a flight of assegais with burning straw or grass attached.
"That's right, lads," he said, "we're just In time. Here they ..come,
thick as bees " And he pointed in the direction Indicated by Umsikilaki.
That worthy had vnished. he and his men having taken to their horses
on the first' alarm. The Basutos as yet. however, were a long way off.
In the clear keen atmosphere against the white background of the snow
they looked like a troop of giant ants crawling down the gentle slope
that.curved around the great elbow, whose bend encircled the northern
valley of the Mandileni. . ' ' " . '}â¢__ _, ,
"They will be two or three hours yet. said Floyd. Bustle up, boys,
and get the wires set. There's plenty to do yet." '. .
At the end of another hour the yard presented a strange and curious
nnnearance Between the two large, huts was a bullock wagon timbered
up with scantling and planks. Other bullock wagons were arranged to
form with the store and the huts, a hollow square. into which the cattle
nnd bor-es'were already driven. Outside of these, and between them and
the wall stretched taut about 2 inches to 3 Inches from the ground, were
crossed and recn.Sbed lines of barbed wire, pegged indiscriminately here
and "there, with pegs having heads like reaping hooks. :â 
Thus it was that when, toward evening, the Basutos. to the number
of- about ISM swept round the little homestead, the two horns of their
lone-extended line enveloping it at about 400 yards distant at either side.
Flovd standing with his wife and daughter. on the, stoep. surveyed the
scene 'with a certain air of complacency.
"Ha' ha' my darling!" he said to Loo. pinching her soft cheek fondly,
"Your old fol-de-101. as you called me when you were a tiny dot. wasn't
such a dashing sergeant in the Seymour .for nothing." r,v
"Will they attack to-night, dear?'' asked Mrs. Floyd. .
"I think not " Nason answered. "Besides, we are going to have a
snowstorm if I mistake not. in which case they certainly won't trouble^us
till the morning; but. to make sure. I will just get out the ammunition. '
Turning into the store with these words, he did not notice Loos face,
its sudden violent flush, its equally swift deadly pallor. As his back was
turned the girl sprang to her mother's side, her lips parted, her eyes dis
tended, her face frightened and white. . . , _ ,
"Mother!" she gasped. "Mother! what shall we do? There- is no am
m- U Mrs "Floyd's face, as she drew the sobbing girl to her arms, grew set
and' rigid and gray and old-looking. As her eye wandered away to the
Veld and that seething, savage line of blacks, her arms convulsively gath
ered her daughter closer to her breast. When, a few moments later, Floyd
came out of the store, a puzzled look on his handsome face, and a careless
"Where on earth have you hid the ammunition. Loo?" on his lips, and met
that picture of despair and grief, the. truth burst on him without words,
and his heart went like Ice within him.' , .
"Oh mv God'" he groaned, standing staring, blankly, numbly, In front
of him. 'then realizing to the full the terrific significance of the silent drama

Then, almost simultaneously, the "book

from 100 to 1 1 she was backed steadily

He looked out past them into the face of the setting sun that was sink
ing, red and angry and somber, beyond the great snow-banked ranges of
the Drakensberg. The wind came moaning up from the southâ cold, fitful,
with here and there a slash of sleet in it. .
"if only there was a chance of getting through," he. muttered; "through
to the N'Taban, and bringing help! â¢It will snow like rugs presently. They
will never attack to-night." .-::..-...
He looked at his wife and daughter. They seemed . suddenly to have
changed characters. It was Mrs. Floyd now who was crying and clinging;
Loo, who, upright and defiant, with her fairy elfin- face almost grim,
seemed to be comforting and persuading her mother.

and commanding. y

"Rubbish! .rubbish!" said Nason, sharply, angry at finding his own
thoughts so articulated, and with a sudden cold grip, of fear for her at his
heart. ,--' ;,â .....,....,
"It is not rubbish," Loo cried, and next minute her arms were around
her -father's neck, and she was compelling him to meet her gaze. "Ah!
you know it's not, father! Dear! don't you see it's the only way for mother
âfor youâ for meâ for all? When it's dark - I shall -get through. I know
every stone of the way. So does, Bess. I shall, 1 shall. And it will save
you, and" (she was sobbing now) "I am so sorry about the ammunition.

but he would order it and send it as soon as it. came. , And I was afraid you
would think be did it on purpose if I told you." â¢ â  '
"What do you think, mother?" asked Floyd, hoarsely, not daring to
look at his wife. *. '
"I dare not say yes," she replied, "though it seems the only chance."
As Floyd turned moodily into the store to count out what ammunition
there was Loo slipped quietly into the house, y . . *
"I'm afraid it's the only way, mother," said Nason. as he reappeared in
a few minutes. "There's barely 300 rounds of rifle and about 800 revolver
cartridges. Enough to stave off one rushâ and thenâ',' Floyd's face ex
pressed the rest. â¢
.By this time it was dark, and the circle of the enemy's fires could be
seen glowing all round. They had drawn still further off, and were now
about 800 yards from the homestead. The snow was driving a white chill
mist before the wind, which was rising now to a gale. â¢ â  ,'
"If she goes, dear, she ought to go at once," said Mrs. Floyd, "for no
horse will get later through the Gap in this snow. But, oh, Nason, do you
think we ought to let her?" * .â â -â¢â¢
"It's certain death otherwise," said Floyd, "for her as well as for us,
motherâ but where is she?"..
"Here; father." and Loo stepped out from the shadow of the doorway.
..."Well. I'mâ blessed!" ejaculated Floyd, gazing at the figure front of
him. For Loo, knowing of old what a skirt meant in a snowstorm on horse
back, had discarded feminine attire, and now in a pair of corduroy riding
breeches, a thick pair of stockings, top boots, a. buff jacket of her father's
and an old Seymour Trooper's hat, with a bandolier around her, a revolver
at her side, and a carbine in hand, stood to attention before her father, ln
her face laughter and tears mingling in a touching strife for mastery. Next
moment she was in the grip of a hug that made her pant with pain and
pride.
"You're your father's own darling! You shall go, and may God help
you, as I believe he will. Isn't she a dainty trooper, mother?" But Mrs.

he said to her: "Take her quietly first. Loo. We will give you five minutes,
and then we'll make a diversion on the far side with the rockets and
Snlders. The first shot you hear, go all you knowâ ride through. Give
me a kiss. dear. God bless you! There's a rocket in your saddle-bag. Send
't off at the Gap."

. Dashing back, Floyd hurried with hit* little party to the rear of the
house, where on the eastern wall his rocket' stand was already fixed. The
time up. he fired half a dozen of those into the nearest group of the enemy,
accompanying it at the same time with a rattling volley. The effect was
magicalâ filling the night with a wild chorus of yells and shouts of terror,
.surprise and rally. Thoy could see dim masses of natives moving up
toward the spot attacked; another flight of rockets revealed in the.mo
ment's glare a scene of wild confusion, as though they were fighting with
each other. At the same time from the stoep came the voice of Mrs. Floyd
calling: "She's through, dear! She's through! I saw her turn and wave
her hat, going at full gallop. And some of them are after her!" â¢ -.
"Give them another lot, Bertie, and then get inside all of you to quar
ter-.'' said Floyd, as be ran out to the front. But the snow was driving like,
a cloud across the plain and night of anything was impossible. The rockets
seemed but to illuminate the darkness. -- . . ' ,
"There'll be no attack to-night, mother. â¢ You had better come in and
lie down.. For wo shall want all our strength in the morning, If Loo is not
back In time." â -â â¢'â â -..â  ,"
y So the night settled down. And through the storm and darkness. in the
tooth of the enemy, rode 800, with nearly forty miles in front of her, be

- It was with a heart tbat beat wildly and loudly that Loo found herself
getting every moment nearer the Basuto lines. Would the promised diver
sion never Come? she thought. Each moment seemed weighted with dread
of the next. She turned to look back. The. snow drove in her face, chok- !
ing her eves and breath. There was no sign of the homestead. Suddenly
a whizz that made her jump in the saddle hissed through the. air, followed
by a great curling snake of tire. She heard the startled yells of the Basutos,
the clashing of Shields and assegais. But she waited to hear no more. With
head bent till she lay almost flat on the mare's neck, with spurs dug home
In the flanks in a way Bess had never known before, she shot like an arrow
through a ring of Basutos, knocking one down, trampling another under
foot, and vanished Into the blackness beyond. Swift as she had been, sev
eral assegais whizzed past her. and she heard the shouts or a blind pursuit,
Till' the second flight of rockets wont up she never moved her position,
keeping on at that breakneck gallop. But then, she could not resist one
turn and exultant shout of triumph, trusting they would see her in the
second's glare from the bouse. And so they did, and so. too, did the
Basutor: and her shout was answered by a yell no less exultant as seven
or eight of the'enemy dashed after her. There was no mistaking her path.
The road to the Gap was the only road for the .umlungi on such a night.
But' In such a chase numbers mattered little till the top was reached.. For
uphill there was but room for one at a time on the bridle path. But.on,the
ridge! Loo shivered as she thought bow they would then spread out and
envelop her. But gritting her teeth together she urged Bess on. And Bess
knew this was no capricious bidding. She knew the meaning of those!

in the dark, on, on, they go; the snow and wind and sharp, keen hail lash
ing them from. behind. Up, and ever up, till the sounds of pursuit grow
faint yet persistent still, and in the very glow of youth within a dozen
yards from the top Loo lifts her head and- shakes her loosened, snow
drenched curls 'and laughs aloud, and in her glee gives forth a ringing
cheer. With one final bound old Bess reaches the broad plateau of the oap
and stands panting. Loo swings herself off the saddle, plants the rocKet
ln the ground and sets it alight: shakes the snow from her nat, ana taKes
a drink from the flask her father. had given her the last thingâ then hang
ing over the ledge listens to the still approaching sound of pursuit. As she
does so a slight moan reaches her ear. She looks around anxiously, to see
almost at her feet, half-hidden in the bush that grows along the ridge, the
pale face of her lover, Morris Scanlan. ''â  â .
"Morris!" she exclaimsâ and in a moment is kneeling by him, her nastc
to his lips.
"I was coming to warn you." he said, "but was caught here in an am
bush. They left me for dead. I'll pull through all right, though, as far aa
that goes! But you?"
"They have no ammunition. I am going to N'Tabankulu for help. But
they are pursuing, me â listen!"
"Quick! Go!" said Scanlan, dragging himself forward on his knees and
hands to the ledge overlooking the gorge leading up to the Gap. "Go!
Don't lose a minute! â  Leave me your carbine and bandolierâ I will hold the
pass! ..; Go-go!" '
For one moment. Loo hesitated, then, with a hot blush, bent forward,
kissed him, and dashed off to her horse, vaulted into the saddle, and went
off at a headlong gallop down the precipitous incline to the plains that led
to N.Tabankulu. .
She was under shelter now for nearly the whole way. Leaving Mount
Frere away to the left, she swung around with the bend of the hills, drop
ping Bess into a long, swinging trot. Mile after mile slipped away. The
moon came stealing out. The wind fell. All the voices of the night bab
bled round her. but she saw nothing, felt nothing, thought nothing. In
front of her was only one scene. A far-off picture like a dream, with, two
parts in it. Her father and -mother gazing into the darkness from the stoep
of the old homestead, ringed round by that cruel circle of savages; and on
the other hand, the gleaming lights of the camp at N'Tabankulu, the clink
and clank of saber and spurs; the ring of the bugles, and the round, cheery
face of her old friend, Lieutenant Hawes. Not once did she draw rein. And
Bess didn't ask for it. Mile after mile, veld and road and ravine slipped by.
The boundary lines were passed. The great rolling upland glided away into
the darkness, and suddenly before her danced the lights of the township.
Ah! how Bess stretched out her neck. and drew her reeking flanks up at the
sight. Up the last slope they mount. To her it seems that the pace is ter
rific. A few privates wandering from the canteen wonder what jaded beast
is this staggering in such fashion. One moment she stops at the camp to
shout a passing word to the watch; the next a sharp turn to the left, a
few more strides, and she tumbles off at the door of the officers' mess-hut,
which she throws open, and stag
gering in says, in a voice that
sounds to herself rather funny
and a long wav off, though she
tries to keep it firm:
"Lieutenant Hawes, the Basutos
have surrounded the â¢ house at
â¢ Mandileni, and father has no am
munition, and you are to go; at
once, please. And Mr. Scanlan's
at the Gap and he is- â ".
And then it seems to her 1 that

baby, laughing, and sobbing over
her and kissing and hugging her,"
and saying, again and again;
"Well, I'm blowed if it isn't
little Loo!" \ ..
It was an unforgettable triumph
for Loo, that. They had
her not to return with them; but,
when she insisted, they. vdted- her

she rode out an hour later at the

BOSTON. Jan. 19.â The far-famed' Lawson carnation has been
sold for $30,000. The purchaser is Thomas F. Lawson, a financier
well known in this city and New York, and in honor of whose wife
the wonderful plant was named. â â  . _ : _â¢_ Â».- :* - '. .
Mr. Galvin, who bred the flower,, announces that he has accepted
the offer made by -Mr. Lawson, and that in future the flower will
blossom solely for the public gardens of . the city of Boston, that be
ing one of the conditions of the' sale. 'â¢ '.-.,''â _ 'â :â " â *, j
When the beauty of the carnation first became known Harlow
N. Higginbotham, the Chicago millionaire,' offered $6, 000 for the plant,
and a little later a New York florist offered $15,000 for the flayer.
BOSTON has her Lawson carna
tion which sold for $30,000 very
recently, but San Francisco has
a carnation, almost ready for
the market, whicl the owner
declares he would not exchange
for $30,000. He says confidently that he
expects to get a great deal more for It.
It's a very beautiful flower, and will be
exhibited for the flrst time next month
at the National Carnation Society's
Exhibition in Phlla" lphia. yy-
Several specimens of this flower were
sent on to Chicago last year and placed
in the Carnation Society's Exhibition.

flower w-- like. Of course the flowers
could not be shown to the best advant
age on account ' the distance and the
difference in cllmr.te. Here is what the
Carnation Society, In its . report, said
about the flt 3r: â .'. y y
Perhaps the most * extraordinary
feature of this exhibition was the
arrival of a large case of blooms
in excellent condition from John
H. Sievers of San Francisco. Not
only did the flowers arrive in excel
lent condition for' the opening day
(the fourth after picking), but some
samples of Hannah Hobert among v
the dozen others represented in the
collection, had flowers of a deep
pink shade and larger and finer
than anything we remember to
have seen in the way of carna-
The Boston carnation measured three
and one-half inches and the San Fran
cisco carnation measured four and one
half inches.
Why, then, did not the San Francisco
carnation receive the first place?
Mr. Sievers exp'.a' ed it t.iis way:
"It Is because the Istance from San
Francisco to where the exhibition was
held made it impossible for us to enter
the competition and comply with the
rules of the society. Our flowers had
to be cut before maturity to travel the
four and one-half days. It is. impos
sible to carry blooming. plants such a
distance and keep them in good con
dition. The rules of the society re
quire fifty flower cut and blooming
plants. We could not do it.
"But we shall be in the coming ex
hibition in Philadelphia next . month.
The secretary liked, the looks of our
flowers which I nt to Chicago last
year. He has taken our cuttings of
ten varieties and grown them for us in
the East." \ - y;; ;'!â /â .'â â â . â

points of one's body, and .s there was
a strong wind blowing, it swung to and

ARTIST MODELS
OF SAN FRANCISCO
Greater Varieties to Be Four)d Here T^an wfjere
Else or) Recount of the Cosmopolitar) Character
of the City.
SAN FRANCISCO painters do not
have to go to New York or Paris
to find good models, for our Lat
in quarter is productive of mod
els worthy of a Parisian atelier.
Unlike the models of Paris, how
ever, who from infancy on through the
seven ages have made the art. of posing
their lifework, the San Francisco mod
els are not born, but are forced to it
through adverse circumstances, or are
"discovered" by some artist. .
One instance of the former class is
that of a beautiful woman now posing
at one of the studios. Her father is. a
major in the English army, but
through an unfortunate marriage the
daughter is so reduced as to be glad
of this way of making an honest living.
Not many years ago only one female
model could be found in San Francisco
who would pose for "the altogether"
for the "life class," as it is called; but
now there are several.
Time was, too, when in order to ob
tain a model of any description, an
advertisement had to be put in the pa
pers, sometimes for several days in
succession, before any one. would ap
ply. Now models call dally at the stu
dios, and have _. regular round of sit
tings. When a model is "discovered"
by a painter, he is not long in becom
ing known, and a good model is kept
busy posing from early morning until
late at night. * .. '
Since the Chinese have become a fad
with many artists, the studios are
overrun with applicants i from â¢ the
Flowery Kingdom, and all kinds and
conditions of Celestials from the lame,;
halt or blind peddler to the sleek, well
groomed merchant, apply as models.
Then, too, since San Francisco has
been turned into a veritable soldiers'
camp, the "soldier boy" model has be
come a frequent applicant at the art
schools and studios. Charles Rollo
Peters has taken advantage of him in
his recent paintings.
The various athletic clubs and our
two universities â¢ furnish models for
the life classes, strong, well-built young
men, who are working ' their way
through college. A Berkeley student has

Sorm of ths Bsst Artists' Models am San Francisco in Their Host Characteristic Poses.
beautiful female model who ever posed
for the painters of San Francisco is
Corinne Tilton, always spoken of* as
"Corinne." She is not only . beautiful
in figure, but she has a wonderfully
beautiful face. Corinne, with her splen
did proportions and her artistic feeling,
is the idol of the studios. She has posed
for every prominent- painter in San
Francisco.
"Portugee Joe," or, as some call him,
"The Pirate," is a most interesting
model as a study of an old man. al
though he is 79 years of age and hashed
a wild life before the mast and as a
whaler, he still retains the suppleness
of youth, and his eyes are as bright
as a pickaninny's. His hair and beard
are not long and white, the mode af
fected by most old men models; but,
instead, he has a clean-shaven face and
looks like a Dominican monk. -He has
posed for everything from an 'Italian
fruit vender to a mendicant friar, and
takes each, pose with fine feeling." He
is now posing in a large painting by
John Stanton as a monk standing with
bowed : head among' the Monterey cy
presses while the. "Angelus". rings cut
at. the old Carmel Mission behind the
hills. This picture will be hung at the
Bohemian Club' Christmas exhibition.
A comparatively new model but one
in great demand at, the studios 's Miss
Aimee Henderson, who has made her
self locally famous by posing for Miss
Maren-Froelich's. ballet girls. She is
considered a splendid subject, and she
can pose equally well as a study of. a
girl "standing with reluctant feet where
the brook and river meet," or a ba'let
girl a little the worse for an empty
champagne glass and a tattered ballet
flounce. "'"'-..â¢ 'Â-*':â 
Her smile is one of her chief charms
for, as .Miss* Froelich puts it, she can
smile to order. "Now give me a merry
footlight smile," and Miss Henderson's
piquant face is dimpling all over "with
a naughty little : twinkle in her eye."
"Now I shall want a nervous smile
for this ballet girl' is making her first
appearance." y
Miss Henderson's face immediately
takes an expression of uncertain cheer
fulness, which" depicts the sink-or
swim, live-or-die J expression of the
debutante. She excels, too, in that long,
narrow Anna Held smileâ cham
pagne smile, that dizzy, frizzy smile
of â¢ the "wee sma' hours." "
. Another favorite model at the studio
is an old man, known 1 only as "the
soak." He is always intoxicated, but
the artists say vhe can take a pose and
keep it and :is a -most satisfactory
model. He is best when - impersonating
himselfâ with a glass and a bottle. | His
only fault as.a. model is that vhe will
talk while sitting.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, FEBRUARY 5, 1899.
On one occasion recently, before a
class of students, he- mounted the
model's throne and, after taking the
pose with a bottle in one hand and a-,
glass in the other, he said in a rather
â¢ thick voice, punctuated with frequent
"hicks," "Now looky here; any fool can
get d-d-drunk, but it t-t-takes a clever t
fellow to a-a-act drunk on the stage."
Among the Turks Boustros Helivee
is considered the best model, and * he .
prides himself upon posing in his own
Turkish costumes, which were import
ed from Turkey. (â¢';'
Mrs. Wildy Is another model who is
exceptionally . well proportioned: . She
poses "for the altogether," and Is con
sidered a splendid subject. Her. story
is a sad one of a young woman having
to pose in order to support herself and
others. She looks upon her occupation
in a very -professional way, and has
gained the respect and sympathy of all
the painters and students in town. -She
posed for the Angel and for the, Go
ddess of History, modeled by Douglas
Tilden; also for j several- pictures by

magnificent specimen of the Franco-
American type. She is 5 feet 10 inches
in height and looks like a Juno. . She
has wonderful coloring and a splendid

bitious to -become an artist herself, and
poses only in order to make money to

LIFE OF A PROFESSIONAL MODEL.
By Annie h\er)d9rsor).
/>Y\ OST people imagine a studio is enchanted ground, and artist
111 and his model live a fairy-tale existence. But for an instant
I 1 I throw aside that illusion; and peep behind the studio door
I I when the artist is not "at home" to the general public. He
is hard at work, and for real hard, honest work he and his model
are unrivaled.
So many will ask, "Is it easy to pose?" Others will say, "How
jolly it must be, going from one studio to another." But again the
reader is invited to peep into the studio for a day. Then you, who
buy these pictures and weave such romances. about them and think
them so charming, may come to stern reality and see for your
selves how little, if any, romance there is in the business.
Most artists demand the model's presence, at 9 or 9:30 o'clock in
the morning, or at 1, should; it .be in the â '. afternoon, or perhaps a
class may consume a quarter of .an hour more. . The studio may
be ten or twelve blocks away,, which means a walk, for the model
earns too little to afford the- luxury, of ; a ride, and even 10 or 15
cents must be considered. When she reaches the studio the street
gown must be changed 'for the : costume in which she is to pose, and
when ready she mounts the "throne," gets into position, and take
the attitude suggested by the. artist. j She is then ready, and for a
quarter or a half an hour is expected to hold the pose; and when It
is a standing position, be assured it is no easy matter. Then fol
lows a rest for flve or ten minutes, and so -on through the morning
until the luncheon hour. "â¢" ,
When a man or woman applies for a position' the beginner is
: given "little encouragement, I and has a troublesome time, but a model
who is thoroughly experienced and well known has no difficulty.
The first question asked generally is, "Have you ever posed?" "For
whom?" or perhaps "Who sent you?" and almost always "Do you
pose nude?" and then, "Have you a good figure?"
All the questions answered, the â¢ artist will drawl ] out, ; "Well, I
: don't need a model just now, but should' I require one I will send
for you, so leave me your address," etc. . â¢',; ' V "â¢ >yy:
- And ten chances to one nothing will ever be heard from the appli
cation again. *.''. ' \ ' â" ,'. y.; 'â  .'"--*, '
As a rule. models who do riot often pose for classes prefer to sit for
the male artist, as most of the women who paint are almost too exact
ing. The men. seem to realize more readily how very hard it is for
a girl to maintain silence for such a length of time and are lenient,
so when r a sigh* or perhaps a little restlessness on the model's part is
noticed the welcome word of "Rest!" is heard and the model will no'
doubt rush for a chair like a fond mother to her long lost. child.
Some \ models | become so accustomed "^ to : standing that \ they ; become
; hardened, >y as it were, and unconscious of surroundings. , -
.* * There are so many different kinds of models required here that It
is really a study in itself. For \ instance, one artist in town revels in
old men with flowing heards, while art-other excels in dainty, fascinat
ing little heads'- of . girls,, and still another chooses - children for his
classes. $ Again ja | preference I is \ shown by some' for a matured . face in
which the : lines caused by sorrow and happiness, . Dame Nature's
: two beautiflers, make : ; so interesting a study." . . ; ,yy^y
'.*.'â¢ Models in San Francisco -are .so-, poorly paid and have, so little
chance to pose it is hard to make a living. For though there are so
many very j clever artists, the field is hardly a fraction of the size of
Paris, Munich or even New York, -y ! â  â¢ x 'j â¢"â¢â â "â â  ' ;
drag her up. I should like to see her
here. She would think me mad if she
knew I was walking in such weather.
"I love such weather. It is not for the
others; it is for me alone, like poor King
Louis', theatrical performances, which he
alone attended. But it. is ever so much
finer out here." '
Once in every fortnight the toilet lesson
was omitted. It was when the Empress
had her beautiful hair washedâ an opera
tion which took five hours.. The teacher
was admitted while the hair dried.
- In some parts of Christomanos' diary he
would repeat sayings by the Empress
without .explaining when and where she
said them. Thus she said: "Men have
noTtheir minds in common, but their fate.
Most people are unhappy because they re
fuse to comply with necessity. If we can
not be happy in our own way we must
take to loving our trials. That alone gives
peace, and . peace is the beautiful on
earth. Beauty is the cause and end of all
things." y.^.y
On Faithless Wives.
Then she said: "People ask why women
are faithless to their husbands. * It is very
simple: Because they MUST be faithful.
The law makes them wish to transgress
it. And, by the way, love has wings to fly
away with." She Warned Christomanos
of some persons at court, and when he
protested that surely all were devoted she
said: "Oh, yes; people are devoted to the
Empress. Perhaps I should thank God
for having made me an Empress! Where
should: l be if I were something else?
People i love me because 'they are some
thing through me." When Christomanos.
told her he had seen her sister, the
. Duchess of Alencon, ln Innsbruck, she
asked: "Did you see her big dog? Whom
did you think handsomerâ herself or her
dog? She would never forgive you if you
did not admire her dog." _>â¢
Once Christomanos found her dressed
for a drive in a black faille dress
hemmed with ostrich feathers hanging
from the rings of her gymnastic appa
ratus. He says she looked like a bird
or a serpent. To get down she had to
jump over a rope. She explained that
she had to receive some archduchesses
and was dressed for their sakes. "If
they knew I had done gymnastics in this
dress,' she said, "they would freeze to
ice." While out walking they talked of
Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Burne-
Jones. She said: "These are souls who
have been in the world before, and have
come back to dream the dreams of men
and women. past and gone."
When she showed Christomanos her
collection of ' horse portraits she said:
"See. these are all friends I have lost,
and I have no new ones. . Many of them
have suffered death . for meâ a thing no
man would do; rather they would mur
der me." â  _â¢".-,.-.'..
Disliked Adulation.
. Christomanos expressed surprise that
she could walk for many hours without
tiring. She said: "I and my sisters owe
that to my father', who regarded walking
as -a' high art, and had us taught by a
special master. My sisters, the Duchess
of Alencon and the Queen of Naples, are
famous for their walking in . Paris. But
we none of us walk as Queens should
walk. The Bourbons, all .of them, who
scarcely ever tread the 'â â¢' ground out of
doors, have taught themselves a peculiar
walkâ walk .of proud geese. They
walk like true Kings." .
She did not always take Christomanos'
ecstatic praise seriously. When he
insisted that she was the magician . be
fore whom- tree and flower bowed and the
wild - beasts of the forest withdrew she
said: "Why, it is the rattle that makes
the wild boar turn and run. Besides, he
would not eat you; he prefers truffles."
When he declaimed upon fhe sweet odor
of the lemon trees in Corfu she said:
"And yet the lemons are so sour!" And
when In Miramar he went crazy over the
sunset and asked her to see how the
pines, bathed in gold and purple curtains,
hung the sky, she answered with a verse
' from hef favorite poet, Heine, to the ef
fect that he might keep heart, for it was
an old story that the sun went uown on
one side and came up again on the other.
Her Confessions of Faith.
"I vowed my palace should be sacred to
Achilles," she said, "because he personi
fies the Greek soul to me. and the beauty
of man and of the land.; I love him be
cause his feet were so fleet He was
strong and . defiant and 'despised kings
and traditions and thought nothing of the
masses of men,' but considered them good
enough to be mown by. the hand of death
like the fields of corn. He believed noth
ing to be sacred but his own will and
lived alone in his dreams, and his sadness
was more to him than all his strong life."
There was a confession of faith.:(^R â  PAGES -liy^^:
PALMISTRY has now come to be
regarded as an exact science,
and its exponents have rightly
taken their place in the ranks
of the professions, along with
the doctors and lawyers and preachers.
All the old atmosphere of doubt and
quackery which formerly surrounded
cheiromancy has been cleared away by
able and skilled investigators, such as
Count St. Germain and Cheiro; their
disciples can. read your life' and char
acter from the lines of your hand with
even more certainty than a medical
man can diagnose disease from your
symptoms.
"We palmists hold our client's secrets
as sacred as the priest does those of the
confessional. Otherwise, how could we
practice at all? You see, once a person
shows his hand to me he lays bare the
secrets of his whole life. I tell with
mathematical certainty air that he has
done in the past and predict with al
most equal sureness the future which
fate has in store for him."
Palmistry is no . new thing. All
through the ages great minds have
closely studied the science. Pythagor
as. Plato, Aristotle, Homer, a dozen
other philosophers and teachers were
among the vanguards of inquirers.
THE CALL Sunday Edition.
Why, even Galen, who is regarded, by
the medical profession as their patron '
saint, was a firm believer. More remark
able still, that redoubtable /warrior,
Alexander the Great, never went into ,
battle without having had his hand
told. So did Charlemagne, the Emperor
of the Franks, and Herman," the de
liverer of Germany. .'. y \- : t->
In later years I can indicate even
more notable examples. Napoleon Bo
naparte and Richelieu, one of the
greatest minds ever produced by
France, were ardent believers in the
science. Then, if these great instances
are not enough, I can point to millions
of recorded observations of the human
mind and character, derived from the
reading of the hand,' all of which show
the' exactitude of palmistry as a sci
ence.
With regard to the' future we palmists
claim, on absolutely unassailable
ground's, that the lines of the hand indi
cate quite as clearly the future as the
past. We have the Bible as authority.'
In the book of Job, xxxvii:7, I read: "In
the hands of all. men' God placed some
signs, that they could thus know their
works." Revelation, - xiv:9: "And : re
ceive this mark (God's) on his fore
head or in his hand." - Proverbs, iii:l6:
"Length of days are in her right hand,
riches and honor in her left." j I Samuel,

GOSSIP OF A SOCIETY BUD
DEAREST MARGUERITE: This
ls the flrst Saturday that we
have not been arrayed in curl
papers waiting for the stroke of
5 to take them down for a
matinee tea. However, we've
had a tempest in our own little teapot
that is a gale compared to the gentle
zephyrs of gossip that float one's, way at
a bona flde tea. The girls have just gone
home, and from their temperature you'd
never guess that it's colder than Green
land. â ; â â¢'â ;â :' , .-.' yy'
â¢ For we had a very spirited discussionâ
sort of indignation meetingâ in fact the
girls fairly oozed anger to such an ex
tent that had the hapless youths 1 dis
cussed wandered in they would have been
inundated.
It's all about champagne. We were dis
cussing the late Oakland punch bowl.
For now arid forevermore cotillon punch
and circus lemonade are to be synono
mous. â¢ ' .-â¢..â â¢;â¢'â"â¢".
Well, we shed a crocodile tear or two
over the fact that the papers had taken
it up. Then we played basket-ball with
the names of the two girls who are sup
posed to have bowed too often to the
flowing bowl.
From cotillon punch of course we evo
luted to champagne, though it is a long
step. We really talked above a whisper
about the "now you. see it, and now you
don't" act which' is sure to take place
whenever there is champagne in sight.
At the last big ball, where it flowed like
water, some of the young men made no
pretense of hiding their preference for the
poppery cork rather than basking in the
sunshine of our smiles.
So we "compared notes and decided that
something must be done. We determined
that we must ostracize somebody and
make the criminal pay for his crime. Up
to this point we were unanimous. But
when it time to a question of whom tb
ostracize we ! weakened and showed the
vulnerable spot in our armor of reform.
For, one by one, as the culprits' names
were mentioned, it became apparent that
the eligible youngsters were to be al
lowed license while the non-eligible were
not even to have liberty.*' ' ;
It was useless to try to make the girls
confess that they were giving the priv
ileges by a dollar and cents standard. As
a matter of fact one would have to play
Diogenes with a search light to And a
youth in our set who has not either been
born with a thirst, acquired it, or had it
thrust upon him. I myself am either for
wholesale reform ox none at all. -
Despite my protests, however, the girls
drew up a list, of those who are to be
given one more chance.
If you miss several . names In the so
ciety column after Lent you will know the
wherefore of it all.
Tuesday evening I went to the Century
Club and fell into print at the head of
the list of "among those present." Gen
eral Shafter and staff In gold lace were
the occasion of the younger people adorn
ing Century Hall. You know we can not
belong to the club until we have reached
years of discretion and discernment. I The
ghosts of essays on 'ologles and 'isms did
not disturb our enjoyment, for we did not
understand them any more than their au
thors did. ' ' " . _
Wednesday afternoon there were two
lunch parties. Gertie Carrol gave one to
Mrs Fred Kohl, and. Emily Carolan was
hostess at the other, with Miriam Moore
as guest of honor. 1 have not yet discov
ered the secret of being in two places at
once, so Mabel and I drew straws and
the family was represented at both lunch
eons. Mabel held up her end at Gertie's,
while I did myself proud at Emily Caro
lan's. All Emily's "bright " particulars"
were there. Carrie Taylor, Cora Smed
berg, the Morgans and Miss ' Cadwalla
der. ' Cora Smedberg has become accli
mated once more, after her long absence.
We chaffed her about her golf playing,
but she took it so good-naturedly that it
turned 'the edge off our fun.
'While Cora was East we heard enthu
siastic reports of her playing. So we all
held our breath at the last game, when
she was to take part for the first time.
Well, Eleanor Morrow made .the course In
eighty-three strokes,- and Theresa- Mor
gan in eighty-one strokes. Genevieve
Carolan and Cora made no returns. Ho v
ever, Cora says she will get in some play
ing that will bolster up her tottering rep
utation as a golfer. Daisy Van Ness is
playing regularly, and the girls say she
will soon take a reserved ( place in the
front rank of amateur experts. ', ' â ..;. .

Although Mr. Astor had led a life main

great pleasure in the society- of literary

with. Mr. Astor, attracted partly by the
latter's promise to endow a public library
in the city of New York. . This was ac
complished after some delay: and the doc
tor was for many years director of .the
Astor Library. He used to . relate some
humorous anecdotes of excursions which
he made with" Mr. Astor. In the course
of one of these the two gentlemen took
supper together at a hotel recently
opened- Mr. Astor remarked, "This man
will never succeed." . :.-.>â  r i"
"Why not?" inquired the other. â '.â 'â¢
"Don't you see,", replied the financier,
"what large lumps of sugar he puts in
the sugar, bowl?"
Once, as they were walking slowly to a
pilot boat which the old gentleman had
chartered for a trip down the harbor, Dr.
Cogswell, said. "Mr. Astor,. I have just
been calculating that this boat costs you
25 cents a minute." Mr. Astor at once
hastened his pace, reluctant to waste so
much money.â Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, in

PALMISTRY.
Continued from Page Twenty-five.
prejudices and be persuaded to take
some reliable work on palmistry and
study it for â¢ themselves, they would
without doubt come to the conclusion
that in the words of Hispanus "It was
Indeed a study worthy. of the attention
of an elevated and Inquiring -mind."
It has come to be : an acknowledged
fact that the skilled palmist can pre
dict with unerring certainty the 'future,'
and the famous pathologist, Professor
Charcot, has demonstrated by his in
vestigations into the higher functions
of the nervous system that . certain
tracts of cells in the brain enable a per
ception of futurity, though the impres
sion is not definitely recorded by
memory. y
You must remember -that, by our
modern teaching, palmistry is divided
into two branches â chirognomy and
cheiromancy. The former" signifies the
outward shape of the hand and of its
members, the latter, divination by the
lines, mounts and marks on the palm
of the hand.
I have no doubt . that, the public is
rapidly learning to accept; these facts
with regard to palmistry. Even in my
own brief . experience i I have known
hundreds of cases. where one visit, or
even a letter,"*-- has insured-? conviction.
There are bo many people' who come
to me with just the same, confidence as
they* would to a doctor. ;. The. distinctive
structure of the Hand, has -been studied
by such; scholars as -Jean' Bellot, Gas
pare!, '^Desbarroles, Lamartine, Victor
Hugo. Why, to come to our own coun
try, it is a well known fact that George
Washington and Abraham Lincoln were
firm believers in palmistry.
! Another very important departure
of the new science is the value which
we" attach to the readings of right and
left hands. ''In former days, when palm
istry was little more than a supersti
tion, it was generally supposed that the
left hand -only should be read, because
it was nearest the heart. This ignorant
idea has long since been exploded; in
fact, In my -practice; I depend -even
more on the Indications given by the
right hand than by the left. The cor
rect principle to follow is the motto:
"The left, is the hand we are born
with; the right is the. hand we make."
The truth of this is obvious, because
we use the right hand so much more
than the -left. Another proof is that
left-handed people have. the lines much
more clearly marked on: the left hand,
so that in their case I should reverse
the rule. ..." y . ; -, . ' . "
Here is a practical illustration of the
manner In which we make our read
ings. Here are fac-simile reproduc
tions of the hands of the most famous
men and women of the day. ; Let us
examine some of them according to the
laws of palmistry. -.' But- first you - must
understand something ' about the way
in which the lines': of the hand are
classified. There are seven important
Jines and seven lesser ones. The seven
frriportant lines are: . ' . Â» â ' . ; '
The line of life, which embraces the :
Mount of Venus.
The line of head/which crosses the
center of the hand.
. The line of heart, which runs parallel
to that of the head, at the base, of the
Angers. -vr-'yi'V'y'y-/. - , â  â¢ ..;.
The Girdle of Venus, found above the
line of heart and generally encircling
the Mounts of : Saturn and the Sun.
The line of health, which runs from
Mount Mercury down the hand.;
The line of sun, Which rises generally
on the plain of Mars and ascends the
hand to the Mount of the Sun. -â¢â¢* ;
The, line of fate, which occupies the
center of the hand, from the wrist to
the Mount of Saturn. yfy -yyV

Sarah Bernhardt's hand is very
strongly marked and of a highly devel
oped order. Love. of the beautiful, and
artistic is very clearly indicated; also
1 a strong willed and impulsive nature.
She is thoroughly bohemian in all her
ways and tastes, has a strong vein, of
superstition, but no spirituality what
ever. Her love of pleasure blinds her
to all ideas of propriety; she makes' her
-own moral laws and rules absolutely
every one who comes in her way. Her
deeply marked lines of fate and sun
show that she has had great success
"in. her professional career. For an act
ress this is the true type of hand.
. Here is a hand of a very different
typeâ that of Colonel Robert Ingersoll.
Note the heaviness and clumsiness of
the palm, with the short fingers. This
indicates a materialistic mind. . No man
could, be spiritually inclined with that
hand. He is moral, certainly, > but sim
ply from an ethical, practical stand
point. The lines indicate great firmness
and ; determination, superlative courage,
combined with strong family love, and
no superabundance of imagination.
The man. is thoroughly practical and
does not idealize any person or thing,
though he has very strong' affections.
The head line drops just enough' to give
him the love of the beautiful and an in
terest in literary and artistic^ matters.
He is, above all, a man who 'strictly;
minds his own business.' The knots
in his fingers indicate that he grasps'
every problem in "an analytical way; as
a writer and ..deep thinker; he views
everything from a materialistic point
of y view and endeavors .to settle all
questions by means ,of a twelve-inch
rule- â¢ ,/. ."' ;.' ;, ')' â â â 
Here is another and famous hand
W. T. Stead, the well-known journalist,
founder of the Review of Reviews. In
the first place, Stead is a man of deep
thought, a philosopher who dearly loves
investigation. Anything .with a mys
tery about it would be attractive to
him. He is a man of ardent tempera
ment, though his level head keeps him
from going too far in any one direction.
So much of -his life has gone in studi
ous investigation that it has detracted
from his animal nature. He is a man
of deep affections, great attractions,
cautious, careful nature. The Jove of
the supernatural' is strongly developed.
He is a good business man, and mar
riage is clearly indicated in his hand.
He will survive his wife. He has .trav
eled much. Still, the fact that the fate
line stops at the head line show that,
though- he has been successful, he has
had .to fight part of his life battle un
aided. â  'â ;.: > y ; yyl\''

Bradlaugh, at a later period the chosen
disciple of Mme. Blavatsky. Here is
the hand of a woman who is a jtrue
philosopher in every sense of the word.
One who is capable of the greatest de
votion to any cause she espouses. The
long thumb indicates that. She has a
great love of detail and going into the
minutest phases of every question. Her
head absolutely rules her heart, B .no
has strong mentality, strong individual
ity, strong moral nature, and is affec
tionate, but with the very highest type
of affection. A great ethical teacher,
an unflinching moralist, a radical < re
former. .She is inclined to be cautious,
not extravagant or impulsive, bne is
a woman of the very highest super
sensitive nature, nervous and excitaDie.
Her idea of art is fully developed, she
loves the beautiful and bright; makes
a splendid leader because of her great
executive ability. Her hand indicates
the remarkable changes of opinion
which have characterized her Hie.
which has really been one of thorougn
disappointment. However, the lattei
part has been, brighter than the first.
The crosses and breaks in her heart,
lines show the greatest trouble. A
woman too highly idealized, too spiri
tual, to be happy in the domestic life.

humorist: : _*.; ',"."â-
Though this is a very poor impres
sion, and the line of fate almost ob
scured, I can read here the life of a
man subject to periods of great depres
sion, of a philosophical nature, given
to violent emotions,' alternating be
tween ecstacy and depression. He is
a. man who has lived a great deal on
the sense plane, is materialistic to a
large extent, loves the good things of
this life, is extremely- philosophical,
possesses ./great , independence of
thought and action; generous, but not
profligate, very, tactful. He has a keen
appreciation of the beautiful in, nature
and art, has made many voyages and
studied many . people; was endowed
with a robust constitution. Very broad,
indeed,' not creed- bound in the slight
est degree. . His early life was made up
of -struggles and disappointments, but
through < it ' all his -â¢sense-. of humor
buoyed him, up. â¢: Had strong likes, and
dislikes. The line of heart â , indicates
many affectionate affairs.! 4 The line of
fate indicates that he will, die far from
the land of his birth. The width be
tween his head and life lines shows a
fearless nature, capable of great free
dom of action. His whole palm indi
cates many disappointments.- brought
about by the strivings of a higher na
ture after an unattainable ideal. The
heart line, running right up to the
Mount of Jupiter, shows high ideals, an
honest, straightforward nature. The
puritanical thumb; is another sign of
this. He has a double, fate line, which
signifies. great success in his profession.

Market and Jones Streets.1p AST week I gave you a whiff of
the fashions the first breezes of
spring will curry in their wake.
It was a mere zephyr, though,
)} â¢fond this time you shall have a
more detailed account.
The summer girl is going to have the
most beautiful of fabrics displayed for
her sweet pleasure. If she Is not a joy
forever it will not be because the shop
keepers do not give her an opportunity
to be a thing of beauty.
All sorts and sizes of boxes that secure in
their .ntricate wrapping baffled my curi
osity last week have had their contents
unrolled before my admiring eyes. If the
clerk who unwrapped them was not
moved by their beauty .it was because
a product of the loom, unless adorning a
fair woman, is powerless to awaken a
responsive chord in man. But even the
clerk so far forgot his masculine indif
ference as to punctuate his labors with
occasional "Ahs" of admiration.
Summer silks, piques, batistes, organ
dies and the sheerest lawn, will blossom
in the shops withcut any regard to the
temperature. Stunning shirt waists now
hidden away will soon have their starchy
elegance displayed to public view. Stripes
and plaids will evidently not be in quite
such nigh favor as formerly. The pret
tiest shirt waists are all made up of a
solid color or of a plain background, with
an embroidered dot of the same or a con
trasting color.
More attention, is given to the cut of
the shirt waist. They are drawn taut and
have lost that negligee effect which many
found ibjectlonable.
Pretty, dainty batistes in plain colors,
and white embroidered in a color, make
up effectively Into shirt waists. The
batistes this season are remarkable for
their diversity in texture and design, so
that when you ask for batiste you are not
at all sure what will materialize. But
anything which can be classified under
that name is generally pleasing.
The batistes will be sold from 50 to 80
cents a yard. The higher priced are
dainties, and since it takes so little mate
rial for the new patterns it is well worth
while selecting them.
For thus.- who do not like the plain
batistes there will be Swiss muslins in
all over small scroll designs, bayadere
stripes and polka dots which are charm
ing.
But prettiest of all for the coming shirt
waist is a new silk and linen material. It
is something absolutely! new. a weave
the dealers declarb lias never before been
offered. It is very tine and glossy, and
the dealers declare Its sheen and elegance
fan withstand frequent introductions
to the soapsuds. It is shown In a Variety
of color and embroidered designs and
costs from $_ to $3 a yard.
NeW Patterns for Shirt Waists
If stripes or plaids are used for shirt
waists: they must be made up on the bias.
They are "pulled well under the belt In
front, the pouch effect no longer being
stylish even In a shirt waist. The sleeves

are just a trifle smaller than those of
last season.
Rather small patterns prevail ' among
the new China silks. Foulards will make
a new bid for popularity and will un
doubtedly gain favor, for the new ones
have an "exquisite satin finish and instead
of the scroll design many show polka
dots of varying . sizes grouped together
with scattering dots between the groups.
Among the new. silks of the heavier
kinds there are moire antique, glossy taf
fetas and shiny brocades prettily shaded
in varying tints. Venetian silks, French
silks with dots and bengallnes with a
soft, small cord almost like a gros grain,
break the monotony of old-time silks.
The piece de resistance among the silk
novelties is a pattern with a narrow che
nille stripe woven Into It. Pearl gray,
with a violet chenille stripe, is very beau
tiful and promises to be a favorite com
bination. Since the craze for chenille
grows apace there is no doubt that these
chenille silks will meet with approba
tion. And the extreme high prices charg
ed for them will prevent them from be
coming common. ' , . .
There is also a new drap d etc. with
silk loops all over it: then there are silk
dotted mohairs.- serviceable camels and
novelty goodÃ from Vienna which are
very desirable. ' '
Delaines and challies are much prettier
than heretofore, and exactly the thing for
the clinging skirts and the soft effects
which are especial feature of fashion. A
local modiste showed me a beautiful
gown of French challle which she is mak
ing for one of our belles. It Is of a beau
tiful shade of mauve. White lace is ap
pliqued in festoon designs around the bot
tom of the skirt and the bodice is like
wise trimmed in the lace applique. Above
the festoons on the skirt will be scattered
sprays of lace. The modiste says these
plain colored challies trimmed in black or
white lace applique are going to be the
rage. ; y
Handkerchiefs to accompany summer
gowns will be fanciful yet dainty. For
those who are willing to forswear the
pure white ones there are handkerchiefs*,
with colored hems to match the shade of
the gown. Of course, the borders must
be hemstitched. Some of the corners are
elaborately embroidered . in silk, with
bunches of flowers or true lovers' knots.
and -pain ted QoWns.
Ever since hand-painted materials for
gowns have become popular, every, one
who can wield a brush has considered the
possibility of decorating the material her
self, thereby reducing the expense.' But
as a rule timidity conquers and oven those
who do attempt it find their efforts any
thing but satisfactory.
Undoubtedly painting is the most- ac
ceptable and If artistically executed the
most beautiful form of adding embellish
ment to. plain colored fabrics. The same
pattern if carried out in art embroidery
would require much more time, labor and
patience, and would be far less effective
and dainty.
I know a very clever girl who designs
and paints half the sheer fabrics that are
offered for sale here at enormous prices.
1 asked her why amateurs could not buy
the materials and successfully* ornament
them. She said they undoubtedly could
with a few suggestions and hints to aid
thorn, which she kindly gave me.
Water colors should be used in prefer
ence to oil on textile fabrics. In painting'
upon white cream or any very delicate
tint loss body color is required than upon
a darker groundwork. While many water
colors arc in themselves transparent in
this kind of work, they must be rendered
opaque by the addition of Chinese white
for light colored grounds. For dark goods
there must first be a coot of Chinese
white painted in smoothly oyer the entire
surface of the design. Upon this, when
dry, the painting proper is put in. :
The design is first sketched in with a
load pencil, or. if we can do so, with the
brush. In many cases, however, the pat
tern is first transferred in outline. This
is accomplished by placing carbon or im
pression paper against the fabric, with
the .design above, and tracing over the
lines with a pointed instrument or a
tracing point. . Â«
A design of violets on cream satin is a
favorite one. Use carmine and blue
mixed for the violet, adding white for tho
light and medium tones. Sufficient white
Is necessary to give some body to the
paint. - .-â¢â :-â¢â :
Greens may be painted with plenty of
white and yellow combined with blue for
bright, sunny leaves, adding a touch of
red or .black to subdue too vivid color.
For the stems use a mixture of yellow
ocher. cobalt and a little septa' and rose
madder. â¢ ..** â â â¢'.-â 
For gray green shadowing leaves and
grasses, mix Antwerp blue or cobalt,
cadmium, a good deal of white, a little
rose madder and black. By varying the
proportions of yellow, blue and red. dif
ferent grayish tints are obtainable, tend
ing more . or less toward /the principal
color used. -. '. ." v;"- - ?;'-- , -..-;â 
By following the genera! directions,
however, any. design may .be executed.
The work is really a pleasure to one able
to do it, and It does not require an artist
of more- than ordinary amateur' ability
to successfully paint ' the, material for I "a
gown. The design chosen must not be
an Intricate, elaborate one,' graceful, care
less . effects : being ; easier and far more
artistic.

â¢ Right bore let me say that of all facial
blemishes freckles are the most obstinate.
In fact, they may be termed incurable.
They are caused by an excess of Iron in
the blood, minute particles of which
find their way through the drainage tract
of the skin and deposit themselves first
under the scarfskin. These, acted upon
by the sunlight, darken into the little dis
colorations called freckles. They may be
removed again and again, but as long as
there is Iron in, the blood and the. sun
continues to shine, they are sure to re
turn. .:-"â -, â ".â '.. â¢ ' â '-,-'.
.The freckles that come with summer j
and fade away at the approach of winter,
may. by the use of simple lotions, vanish,
but the constitutional or "cold freckles"
depart only when the scarfskin Is remov
ed. Even then, when the scarfskin grows
again, the freckles also return.
However, by protecting ; the new scarf
skin, the little "kisses of Apollo" may be
kept at bay, or so obstructed that one's
vanity will not suffer to any great extent.
After having got rid of the â¢ freckles a
good way of keeping them from return-'
ing is. before exposure to the wind or !
sun, rub a very thin . coating of cold
cream over the face and cover, with a j
sprinkling of a good pure face powder.
Then, If you will further protect the skin '
by wearing a veil or carrying a good- j
sized . parasol, I think ; that you will en- j
joy immunity from the little golden spots. 1

RUBY WHlTEâ Cocoanut oil in its pure
state Is a very excellent hair producer, â 
so I. would- not advise your using It upon ;
the skin. One ounce of it in combination
with one ounce of, lanolin, one ounce of
oil of sweet almonds, one-half ounce
spermaceti, one-half ounce white wax,
ten drops tincture of â¢ benzoin and one
ounce orange flower water, makes a very
excellent skin food, and will make your',
skin smooth and lovely. Steaming \ne
face every night, unless there are black- !
heads, is altogether, too often.' Once in j
two : weeks is better. . After steaming the
face any cold cream or skin food can be ;

HINTS FOR
SPRING HATS
/?=3 OME of the hats that milliners are
SOME turning out that their fashion
now turning out for their fashion-
C^-j) able patrons are very suggestive of
springtime, .though the flowers
used in trimming. them, are not like the
light ones used In summer, but are heavy,
rich affair.-- of -velvet or silk, combined
with chenille; Brims are . often made of
an open-work lattice of chenille. Masses
of velvety green leaves with nasturtiums
look extremely well on a brown hat with
russet velvet ribbon.
The draped velvet toques that have
been fashionable all winter are robbed
of their stiff wings and quills, and sup
plied with big bunches, of velvet violets
that have long stems that hang in tassel
effect. The big all-black picture hat has
the feathers removed and treated to a
freshening process, and a bunch of big
red or yellow roses fastened under the
brim and a single rose and bud nodding
among the feathers. These touches add
smartness to the millinery that is not
new, and banish that look of dowdiness
that every woman so hates. Of course a
few dollars must be spent in accomplish
ing this, but It will be a long time until
the light spring millinery Is in season.
Since toques are so exceedingly stylish,
one can have very fetching little bits of
headgear at extremely low figures, and
the handy woman has not found It be
yond her to fashion her own toques this
winter. A favorite style Is the one that
is draped from the back, the velvet fall
ing easily over the frame, and bunched
up right In front with a shot loop or two,
and a close cluster of small flowers. Long
pins, with big jet heads, are Jabbed
through the folds of .velvet, and are
stuck through bows and among feathers.
A New York fashion letter says that
"All manner of owls, from the screech
and barndoor varieties to the smaller and
more rare ones, decorate the new turbans
and toques, the bird of wisdom topping
in solemn, dignity many frivolous toilets
of ruffled taffeta, under a fur-trimmed
velvet pelisse. The brown and white of
; its plumage j looks especially well with
black velvet and sable. *

such gratifying results. To. reduce the
large stomach try this exercise: Lie flat
on the back upon the floor. Fold the
arms and raise the body to a sitting pos
ture. Repeat five times. Then lie upon
the floor and raise one leg as high as pos
sible, then the other. Repeat this several
times. At first this will tire you quite
considerably/but as the muscles become
strengthened you will find that you can
repeat the exercises fifteen or more times
without becoming wearied. There has
been a special Beauty Talk about moles
since, your, letter was written. Am sure
you must have seen it. Hope the sprained
hand Is all right by fhis time.
T. H. S. N.â Before applying any lotion
for the coarse pores, get rid of the black
heads by scrubbing the face every night
with a camel's hair complexion * brush.
Follow the scrubbing with the application
of a good cold cream. Strict attention
must be paid to the diet also. Avoid all
rich, greasy foods and eat plenty of fruit.
Take regular exercise, a daily tepid
sponge bath and. two hot. soapy baths ix
week. When the blackheads have dis
appeared apply the following lotion: Pre
cipitated sulphur. 1 dram: ether, 4 drams;
alcohol, 3 1 ounces. Shake well before
using, and rub into the skin at night, just
before going to bed. It will clear the skin
and at the same time draw the pores
closer together.

VIOLETE-Borate of sodium, 1 dram:

relief. Warts may be removed, by touch
ing the center of the wart lightly with
a lunar caustic pencil once a day. It will
turn black and gradually .disappear. Be
.very careful not to get the, caustic on any
of the surrounding/skin. The. name of

for it. If you have any doubts about us

cream formula for which is given in
reply to Miss A. Amazon, i I have never
known of the skin food having the ef

JX Machine to Wash Baby.
A "BABY- WASHER", is the very lat
est appliance for reducing the car
of mothers and making the . lusty
lunged youngsters take a more
cheerful view â¢of life. England Ij
said to be responsible for the invention,
but if the machine' docs one-half what is
claimed for it the mother country will not
long be alio wed. to enjoy alone the. bene
fits accruing from the use of the device.
When a child gets so soiled that his
appearance suggests a worker in a coal
mine, the man behind the wheels in a
railway engine or a New York cable car
conductor on a Saturday night, then is
the time to put this delightful scheme
into instant operation.. First take the
boy and place him near the machine.
Probably he will shy at it, for the device
is not of an appearance calculated to
make the infant lose itself in an ocean
of delight by merely cursorily inspecting
lt. But never mind the marked disap
proval of the youngster. There is an ori
fice through which the body of the
washee is to be Inserted by the person
who superintends. the washing.
This orifice can be regulated as to size
by simply turning a cogwheel. The hole
can be made larger or smaller, and can
thus accommodate the baby that took the
prize at the size show as well as the child
that looks of normal proportions only by
the aid of a microscope. :,-â¢/" _, '_]
Through this orifice, then.. Master Baby
Is inserted. A highly polished plane is
the first thing that claims the attention
of the boy. Down it he slides to what
must seem to his infantile mind an ex
ceptional length. At the bottom he is
confronted by an inviting rubber tube,
placed in such a position as to imme
diately meet the lips of the young visi
tor. . ... .
The slight pressure in the art of which
every baby that ever breathed is a past
master is sufficient to draw out a care
fully prepared : quantity of the most
healthful milk. After wearying of this
form of sustenance the baby takes a
glance around the compartment and finds
that he has entered a plate glass mir
rored house, the like of which has never
before appeared to him. An automaton
monkey sits near by and thrusts into
baby's hands a combination nail cutter,
tooth cutter and rattle. An electric ap
pliance furnishes music popularly sup
posed to reduce youngsters to a condition
of sweet sleep. -. .
When the. purpose of the music has been
achieved the baby sleeps and is then
turned into the third compartment, where
the actual washing "is undertaken. . The
nails are nicely trimmed, the hair brushed
and when baby awakens from his nap he
is a sight for gods and men and a fit or
nament to any society. â¢ y .
The name of the inventor of this de
lightful system has not been revealed to
the public, and there ' are certain of the
skeptical who ridicule the idea of the
plan being practicable. This view, the
friends of the invention claim, is merely
the expression of the jealous and not to be
seriously considered by any one In. real
need of a patent "baby washer." *. yyy
much doubt if yours is as noticeable as
you fancy it Is. If the tiny hairs are
dark, bleach them out with peroxide of
hydrogen. The easiest way to steam the
face is to fill a deep china bowl with boil
ing water, envelop the head In a sheet
folded four times and then hold the face
over the rising steam, tucking the sheet
closely, around so that none of the vapor
will escape. Wash the face thoroughly
and smear with cold cream before begin
ning the steaming operation. I fear that
the pimples will persist in returning. so
long as the internal economy is not ln
perfect order. Suppose you have this pre

NEW YORK. Jan. 30.â Anthony
Hope keeps very steadily at work
these days. I have word from
England that he has lately com
pleted a new , novelâ one that
promises to be especially Interest
ing, because it gives us the two Anthony
Hopes in one. No one who has read both
the "Dolly Dialogues" and "The Prisoner
of Zenda" needs to have it pointed out to
him that there are two Anthony Hopes
one a humorist of such persistence that
you might think he could never be seri
ous, and the other a romancer of so much
sentiment and heroism that you might
think he could never be gay. In this new
novel, my Information is, there is all the
lightness and liveliness of the "Dolly
Dialogues," and also the same affluence of
sturdy adventure that marks the Zenda
tales. It Is rather a short novel, I under
stand, and it is to bear the name of its
hero, "Captain Dieppe. "
With the native ability for novel writ
ing given, there need be no wonder that
Anthony Hope should produce good
stories with the readiness that he does,
for he pursues his work with the punc
tuality of. a bank clerk. To a friend who
called on him recently in his London
chambers he said: "I reach here at
quarter to 10 in the morning and work on
till 4in the afternoon, or even later. I do
not set. myself any fixed task to be per
formed each day, but work rather by time
and take what heaven sends. I am a
quick worker, and, though I never re
write, I revise carefully and am very
fldgetty over my work."
To this same friend he avowed that he
was not much of a readerâ and this. I
think, would be the confession of a ma
jority of the writers of stories. When
he does read he prefers novels, and Kip
ling, Meredith and Stevenson are his
favorite authors.
Stephen Crane returned a few days ago
from Cuba, where for some months he
had been making special studies of the
inner life of the people, partly in the In
terest of New York newspapers, but more
especially, I fancy, in the interest of his
own future work as a story writer and
novelist. He showed very plainly the ef
fects of his campaigning; he had min
gled symptoms of Cuban fever and New
York grip, and altogether presented him
self in such bad shape that his friends
were much concerned for him. But he did
not allow their sympathies to be stirred
by his aspect long. He remained here
only two or three days, and then set sail
for England. His present Intention Is to
make quite a residence there, taking up
the sojourn that was broken off so sharp
ly when the beginning of the war drew
him home and then on into the field at
Santiago. But present intentions don't
hold very rigorously with Mr. Crane, so
he may be back In the United States in
no time. He is a most Industrious seek
er of impressions, and, happily for his
impulse, his relations leave him perfectly
free to come and go as he will. He lives
entirely by his pen. and yet free, as a
rule, of any close-binding connection with
journals; and so he may choose time and
place almost with the latitude of a man
of leisure, instead of the extremely hard
working author that he is.

GRACE KING has just issued a
most admirable work entitled
"De Soto In the Land of Flor
ida." It covers all of the do
ings of the discoverer and his
party while in this country and
considerable of what happened before
they came. - *
In handling the subject the author has
put romance enough into it to make a
novel; at the same time she has stuck to
facts. Her style is graphic and readable,
and the book is a valuable addition to the
literature of the day.
For her mode of telling .her story and
her point of view the author has this to
say:
As long as there have been in this
world two men telling the same story,
there have been two ways of telling that
story; and if there are two readers, there
will be just so many ways of believing it.
3* seemed hardly more necessary here,
than in the soldier stories of our own Civil
War, for instance, to confute and refute,
sift and weigh evidence, when the ques
tion is only one of mere human character
istics, exaggerations and discrepancies,
which are the earmarks, after all, of hu
man experience, varying in detail, but
agreeing in the main essentials.

DAILY NEWS ALMANACâ years
of American history are replete with so
many momentous events as have been
crowded into 1898. and all of them have
been handled in the Daily News Almanac

both truth and their importance. A cur

the volume to contain a fair and concise
account of the Spanish-American war,
with valuable" articles on the Philippine
Islands, Porto Rico, Cuba and the La
drones. The whole subject of the annexa
tion of Hawaii, sunnlemented by a de
scription of the agricultural, mineral and
industrial value of the islands, is given .
tn<- importance it deserves.
The- movement for the dismemberment
of China and Africa are among the for

place that will be appreciated by others
than the Zionists themselves. "The ro

Last Monday night Lincoln Lodge held
! a meeting with forty-six of the members
!in attendance. A stranger was Intro
j duced and inducted into .the mysteries of
1895 appeared a colored boy carrying in
his arms a cat looking very much the
worse for a night in Martin Engel s
district.. . . Â«_ _
"Say, boss, don't you want to buy. a
cat?" asked the boy. "You f can have
him for the price of a drink.
Mr. Hughes thought of the mice that
had eaten his paper boxes and paid 10
cents *
Nicodemus was by no means a shin
ing success as a mouse catcher ana air.
Hughes looked doubtfully at him. /
"He's a bad bargain at 10 cents, he
said to his brother; "can't earn his
"Turn him out and put it to profit and
loss." said the brother.
"He's fit for nothing. I guess 1 11
enter him at the cat show,'' said Mr.
Hughes. "He's ornamental.'
And they paid the $1 entrance fee
and called him Nicodemus, by Broom
stick out of Dustpan, by Sweeper, by
Brush. And when they had given Nic
odemus a bath or two and fed him on
quail for a week and put a silver col
lar around his neck he looked as if
the very mention of Hester street would
paralyze him with horror. And the
judges of the show came around and
then the experts and they looked at
the pedigree written on the card tacked
around Nicodemus' neck, and said
wisely: "Ah, yes; dear me. Nicode
mus, by Broomstick out of Dustpan,
by Sweeper. Yes, yes. to be sure.
Might have known it. Very fine speci
men of the breed. You can't beat that
blood." 7-V.'-v .;-. ,",
Mr. Hughes was in a hotel cafe with
a group of friends when he heard th <t
Nicodemus had been awarded a first
prize V the judges, and for the nexr
ten minutes the crowd was rilling ever
the seats in cachinnatory ecstacy.
For the next ten days offers to buy
Nicodemus at any priceâ $2000.
any old priceâ poured in upon Mr.
Hughes. Cat fanciers thronged his
outer office bidding one against the
other in fabulous sums. One doting old
woman drove up in a carriage with an
offer of $3000. But Mr. Hughes, who
is beyond the reach of temptation,
could not accept money under false pre
tenses, and in despair at last made a
full confession of the hoax.
The joke habit once acquired Is not
easy to shake off. His next attempt as
the result of a bet was made upon the
wily, unimaginative gentlemen who
control the city departments of the
morning newspapers. Mr. Hughes
bought an old desk at an auction, and
one day he discovered a secret drawer,
and in the drawer were some old gas
bill receipts. Then was suggested to
him the idea of putting a pile of can
celed checks and old bonds of extinct
or bogus companies in that drawer.
And along Park Row. there presently
floated a story of the discovery in Mr.
Hughes'. desk of bonds and diamonds
aggregating a value well up in the hun
dred thousands. It happened to be a
dull day for news, and every city edi
tor hugged the story to his breast and
proceeded, in the language of the Row,
to "play it up" for all it was worth.
Romance, wealth, with just a sugges
tion of murder, were there, and each
of the star writers assigned to the story
embellished It with his favorite touches
of delicate fancy. A question arose as
to whether the Public Administrator
was not entitled to the papers. . The
Public Administrator thought so and
went after Mr. Hughes, who carefully
kept out of reach.
Mr. Hughes and an artist friend
named Rork were in the country one
day and dined at a roadhouse. Rork
sprinkled the rear of the . barn with
kerosene oil so judiciously from casks
in the cellar that the hotel man be
lieved that he had discovered an oil
well. Hughes offered him $25,000 for
a half interest in the scheme, and
agreed to write out a check for $5000
as a guarantee of good faith. But the
hotel man, who had been carefully told
by Rork that his well was a belcher,
declined.' _ But an opportune drummer
turned ' up, and 'the -drummer knew
Hughes and his ways and thus spoiled
the joke.. "--:">â¢;.'-
Tom Costigan will never forgive him.
At a little dinner at Maretti's Tom Cos
tigan was presented with a $250 watch.
After the presentation it was passed
around. Presently it came to Hughes*
turn. Hughes had provided himself
with an oroide, got the watch, made a
quick substitution and dropped the imi
tation on the floor. It was smashed
. into a hundred pieces. The real watch
was up Hughes' sleeve. The company
was dumb with horror. Costigan was
in an icy perspiration and. losing flesh
at the rate of a pound a minute, and
then Hughes quietly opened his hand
and displayed the perfect watch.

evening was disposed of there was pre

As Suggested By," Peaceful Meg."
SEEING "Peaceful Valley" at the
Alcazar reminds me that the
American play of to-day is look
ing up. 'Peaceful Valley" was
written in a day when those
unique native comedians, Nat Goodwin.
William H. Crane and Sol Smith Rus
sell, had each evolved around his own
personality and comedic specialty a dis
tinct type of comedy-drama. We had
the Goodwin play of youthful comedy
and heroic sentiment, the Crane play
of marked Americanism and commer
cial intrigue, the Russell play of ec
centric habit and rural character.
. These actors pandered to their person
r; alities; their authors were their slaves,
â¢;.- their tailors; the public nad accepted
them in certain characters, and. so it
..'seemed, they would stick to those char
"acters for the balance of their profes
sional lives. But happily the public
tired of this continuous business, and
. the comedians, as all comedians will.
commenced to yearn for seriousness.
Mr. Goodwin branched out with the
sheriff in "In Mizsoura," and gave one
of the strongest character impersona
tions In the history of the American
theater; he played David Garrick with
- less success, and Bob Acres in "The
Rivals" with as much; and then he
â '*. . went back to the old game with An
â¢ American Citizen," and now he is at
veal work again in "Nathan Hale." a
play that is said to be of really traffic
power. Mr. Crane essayed "A Fool of
Fortune," in whose character of th* 1
broken-down stock operator he exe
cuted a death scene in the last act: and
after that he appeared in "A Virginia
Courtship." a costume play of consid
erable pretension. Mr. Russell was the
last to break away from himself, which
he did in "A Bachelor's Romance,"
a serious piece that San Francisco
has yet to know. From all accounts
these actors have gained by their in
novations. Nat Goodwin is now recog
nized as one of the greatest of Ameri
can actors. He and Mansfield and
Joseph Jefferson represent the tippest
top of their craft. Crane, too, is reck
oned a big man. and where thousands
of butchers, bakers and candlestick
makers used to travel miles to see him
gheroize a middle-aged tradesman, he
now finds as many admirers of another
class. Sol Smith Russell we have not
Been since his authors have quit
humoring his personal eccentricities;
but it is a matter of record that in a
new style of play he scored his first
successful season in New York. It used
'-.-. to be said of him that he made a for
tune in the small towns every year,
only to lose it in New York. And the
author has profited as well as the actor.
Augustus Thomas clinched the reputa
tion that had come to him through "Al
" abama" by writing "In Mizzoura." No
matter how many potboilers he turns
; out. we must always reckon him as one
of the first to write a beautiful, definite
American play. "In. Mizzoura". is as fine
a play of character and local manners
as "Secret Service" is of action. Clyde
Fitch's "Nathan Hale" is said to rank
with the cameo he cut for Richard
Mansfieldâ "Beau Brummell." These
actors whom I have mentioned, the
best patrons of American plays,
have done a lot to emancipate the na
tive play- writer, and it is only natural
that many of .the old tailor-made pieces
should now appear tame and silly ln
. the light of modern drpmatic compo
sition which is not written in flagrant
glorification of the humors and bland
ishments of the actor-purchaser. Wag
ner wrote operas that taught a
new and less ridiculous method of
opera singing. In fact he made a new
breed of singers. Until recently the
American actor, with countably few
exceptions, has made his name and
fame in foreign playsâ plays to
which he had to fit his acting, not the
other way round. It is a pleasant thing
now to think of the American author
and actor working hand in hand, so to
speak, with the actor in his proper
place of appreclator and interpreter;
for the drama that is rigidly modeled
on the personal whims and graces of
its actors has very small association
with literature. And from all tokens
it would appear that to-day the Amer

lean Drama is a strong possibility, if
indeed it be not already an achieved j
fact.
â¢â¢ ' â¢
"Peaceful Valley," which suggested
this rather solemn train of thought', is
typical of the play that retarded civili
zation on the American stage. This is
not to say that it does not have its mo
ments of value. Quite the contrary. I
found a great deal in it the other
night*- that was genuinely entertaining,
and as not Sol Smith Russell but Er
nest Hastings was playing the principal
part of Hosea Howe, I could for once
take that part at something like \ its ,
own value. Mr. -Russell, like Mr.
Goodwin, always managed to make a
part, even the whole play, look to be
something much better than it really
was. â¢ That was where : the mischief
came in. The people loved and popu
larized these actors in a certain cut and
dried line of work, while good plays
rotted Â«r else went unwritten for lack
of encouragement. Take out of the
part the popular, personal spell of the
actor and you throw a terrible search
light on its imperfections. I do not
mean this in dispraise of Mr. Hastings'
performance of Hosea Howe, which is
much better than he or you or I had
any reason to believe it would be: but
Hosea is like a coat tailored for a man
with a hump; put a straight-backed
fellow in it and he fills in too well in
one place and not enough in another.
From what little I have seen of Mr.
Hastings' acting I should say that it
is emphatically of the humpless variety.
He is an actor of versatile authority,
and his impersonations are generally
careful and consistent, and yet fairly
spontaneous in. their effect. It is only
rubbing in the obvious to say that he
cannot play Hosea as well as the
player who inspired the play, and only
justice to what must be a herculean
effort to say that he acquits himself
I better than would most stock com
pany leading men in a similar trial.
Hosea, as you perhaps remember, is a
good young man who . lives on
a "perpendicular farm" in the
White Mountains with his widowed
mother. He has managed to acquire
education and religion and to preserve
a rural dialect as thick as Den
man Thompson's or James A. Hearne's.
His sister has been betrayed by the vil
lain from the city; and when the villain

advent and her brief season promises to

Concerning a recent Eastern appearance
a critic remarks: "Carreno has the power
of a Busoni as well as the sentiment of a
Paderewski. In fact she mofds both Into
one, and brings out the nice shading ef
fects just as they are required. Her runs
are clear, staccato, crisp and true, and
the pianissimo cadenzas abound, literally
drip out In perfect form. Combined with
the masterly power of conception and
executive strength is a wonderful tech
nique that reminds one forcibly at times
of the fingering of Rosenthal."
Her programme for to-morrow evening

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. The stock market was
strong the greater part of the day, but early
gains were lost and prices receded until they
had made a slight net loss on the day. The
bank statement decrease in surplus of about
J1. 750.000 was the ostensible reason for prices
running off In the late dealings. London was
a purchaser In this market and the market
there for Americans ended firm. Locally there
was a continuance of purchases by large in
terests noted yesterday and round amounts of
short contracts were covered. Confident try
ing of high priced stocks, including New York '
Central and Pennsylvania,, gave strength to the i
rest of the list. It was announced that New j
York Central was to operate the West Shore I
railroad more directly and that a separate or- i
ganization would be maintained only as far I
as the West Shore board was concerned. !
Among the other stocks showing conspicuous j
strength on the rise were Wheeling and Lake I
Erie preferred, Northwest, Rio Grande and |
Western preferred, Denver preferred, Canada
Southern, C., C. & St. Louis and Southwestern
preferred, which rose from 1 to 2 points.
Metropolitan advanced 9 points, of which It
retained 5; Third Avenue jumped ll 1 ., of which
It lost -ty and Consolidated Gas and Brook
lyn Union Gas retained 3' 4 and 2". respectively I
of large advances. In explanation of the |
strength In these stocks lt was said that
Metropolitan was to -absorb inird Avenue.
This was denied, however, and the purchases
of Metropolitan were said to be based on re- ,
sults expected from the operation of exten- i
sions about completed. The strength of the '
gas Blocks was on further consolidation talk. j
Great Northern preferred held 7 points of an
even greater rise on intimations of a possible
distribution of assets to stockholders. Inter
national Silver gained 3"_ on the day. Lake;
Erie and Western cropped 6 points on Using 'â 
relegated to the non-dividend paying ranks, but
recovered more than half of the loss. The !
common stock showed sympathetic weakness j
early, but recovered and ended with a frac-
tynal advance. In the reaction ensuing on the
appearance of the bank statement, especial
weakness was shown by Manhattan, Reading
first preferred. New York Central, Peri >'l- I
vania. the Grangers, Northern Pacific, Missouri |
Pacific, Southern Pacific, Atchison' preferred, j
Federal Steel, Brooklyn Transit and Sugar. I
The bank statement, which affected sentiment j
adversely, was a surprise In several respects.
Trading in stocks for the week left prices
lower for the more prominent shares. The '
volume of business was contracted compared
with the large dealings of late, but were still
much greater than at this time in other years. j
Honey continued in abundant supply and rail
way report* were generally gratifying. The
most important net declines for the week :
were: New York Air Brake. 994: Lake Erie â 
and Western preferred, 9*, and Reading flrst
preferred. 3, but there were many smaller de
clines in active stocks, which show the ten
dency to have been downward. Advances, in .
excess of .'. points were: Great Northern pre- j
ferred, IS*; Metropolitan Street Railway,
14; Consolidated Gas. 13%; New York, '
New Haven and Hartford, 11; Burlington. Cc- :
dar Rapids and Northern, 10; Brooklyn Union ;

7*: Chicago and Alton. 6. and International
Silver. 5%. Denver and Rio Grande. Mobile j
and Ohio, Pullman, Minneapolis and St. Louis
second preferred also made handsome advances.
The grangers showed losses ranging from over
1 point to 3%. which was Burlington's decline.
Losses were quite general among the coalers
and industrials.
Business ln bonds during the week was on an
enormous scale, with a good tone. United
States 3s advanced * and the 6s registered *.
The new 4s declined * bid price.

NEW YORK MONEY MARKET.
NEW YORK, Feb. 4.â The Financier says:
The statement of the associated banks of New
York City for the week ending February 4
shows a decrease in surplus reserve of $1,779,
--360, the first contraction noted since December
10 last. The shrinkage, in view of the enorm
ous expansion in loans and deposits, ls moder
ate, being offset to a degree by the gain of
$2,816,900 in cash reported. The statement seems
to reflect in a belated manner the activity of
Stock Exchange speculation, and probably deals
with the previous Week's business as much as
with current operations. The Increase of $15,
--164,400 in loans, for example, cannot altogether
be charged to the past week, as the volume of
exchange transactions fell off appreciably. The
gain ln deposits amounted to $18,385,000, which
ls about normal, taking the cash and loan ex
pansion into consideration. The actual ex
pansion of cash Is less than had been figured,
but lt is doubtful if the averages reveal the
full result of the gains from the interior. A de
tailed analysis, ln fact, shows that one bank
gained over $4,000,000 in specie, which is almost
twice as much as all the other banks.
The special operations and shifting of funds
doubtless have had much to do in bringing
this about. Taken as a whole, , the statement ls
favorable. Never before have the totals ap
proached such figures as- are now being re
ported. But, despite the unprecedented ex
pansion of loans and deposits, . the banks .are
carrying $35,465,250 idle cash, and with receipts
over all disbursements, there seems no, limit
to the power to meet the demands made upon
them. As a matter of fact, the New York
clearing institutions have doubled their busi
ness In a little over two years and- still have,
surplus reserves beyond the average. The cur
rent statement may have the effect of tempor
arily stimulating the money out, but it Is too
much to expect, even with an expansion, in
totals such as the week's operations reveal,
that rates can maintain such, an advance. It
will require a much more appreciable reduc
tion of surplus to bring about a change of that
character. *â¢ 'V^tVy''; ..-*''; â â â¢â } 'rr-'i â¢'â¢ '-:':
THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. Feb. 4.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says: The
stock market here opened steady to-day, hard
ened gradually and closed strong. Americans
were fairly active for a Saturday, but business
was confined almost exclusively to repurchasing
after yesterday's bear sales. Confidence was
weakened somewhat by the sharp break in New-
York yesterday, but prices generally were high,
and at the finish were at the best. Northern
Pacifies and Union Pacifies were the chleW
features.' Coppers were firmer, especially Ana

CHICAGO, Feb. 4.â Although decided weak
ness prevailed here yesterday, the early Liver
pool wheat quotations to-day came only %d
lower and Continental markets ruled strong and
unchanged. That imparted a good deal of con
fidence among traders here, resulting In a firm
market at the commencement. May opened *c
higher at 73*Â®73* and touched 73% c. This I
caused' the' execution of a few scattered buying
orders. At that point, however, liquidation set
In and started a gradual decline that did . not
stop until 72c was- reached. Near the close
heavy clearances started a reaction- and May
rose to 72*Â®72*c, where It closed %c lower.
Corn suffered . a severe break on general
liquidation by longs.. Holders seemed to be
thoroughly discouraged and nearly everybody
took a hand ln the selling. The close was at a
loss of %@%c. * ,
Oats shared in the weakness of the other
grains, closing %Â®%c down. â '..
1 The weakness of the grain market exercised
a depressing Influence on . provisions. . General
outside liquidation and selling on stop-loss or
ders through commission - houses forced a de
cline nil around. May pork declined T2*c, lard

the consumers have been very shy. about buy
ing any quantities of hay, and to effect sales
of dally consignments concessions In prices
had to be made. The market, has continued
steadily to decline and at the. present time Is
thoroughly weak, and a want of confidence is

THE STOCK MARKET.
Mining stocks rose again yesterday and
touched the highest prices for months. Sales
were heavy, as will be seen by the list of
transactions. The rise during the* past week
has averaged 50 per cent,' as will be observed
by the appended table of fluctuations. It now
appears that the recent' buying orders were
mostly from Virginia City, and were based on
the proposed extinguishment of the smoldering
fire In the stopes between the ' 1400 and 1500
levels of the Con. Cal. & Va. mine, where the
superintendent believes a large body of ore ex
ists. He says that he has secured good evi
dence that considerable ore of good quality re
mains in the burned district, and feels" justified
in recommending the â¢ company to spend the
money necessary to put out the fire and recover
The sugar stocks led the business on the
Bond Exchange and Hawaiian Commercial
made a further advance of $74 25.-
The Pacific Lighting Company will pay the
regular monthly dividend of 40c to-morrow.
The Central Gaslight Company and the Cali
fornia-Cotton Mills will pay â¢ the - usual quar
terly dividends of $1 per share this month .
The Swansea Mining Company, of Utah will
pay Its twenty-ninth dividend, amounting- to
$5000, on the 10th Inst. " *,âÂ°
-Early last week the northwest drift on the
140-foot level of. the Sierra ; Nevada mine I
reached the'footwall of the vein and was stop
ped. The last 150 feet of that drift had passed
through a clay formation which . is the West
clay of the vein. A north drift has been start -
ed just east of where the west clay was first
encountered, and a survey shows that the drift
will have 230 feet to run to reach a point under
the place where a body of good ore was found
in the Riley ' tunnel workings above. The In
tervening ground through which' this drift will
pass has never been; explored. â¢

An interesting calculation has been
made, which' shows that one pound of
good coal equals the work of one man for
one day. One square-mile of a seam of
coal only four feet deep .would exceed the
work of 1,000,000 men for twenty years.

well, but they know - how to do some
things. "My young friend," said Ito
Tad, "don't you wish to eat some nice
apples?" "Off course," said he. "where
are they?" â <x ,i
. I .pointed out the way and in a few
minutes we were going up the hill
toward the apple orchard as loving like
as two brothers. The orchard was
some distance from any house or I
would not have gone with Tad or any
one else in broad daylight. There were
the apples, hanging up too high for me
to reach them. " TaA could climb pretty
well, so I found out. He filled all h.'s
pockets with apples and threw down
some to me. Then he heard the farmer
coming and away we ran together. He
was. of course a naughty boy to take
th" farmer's apples away and you
know what often happens to bad boysâ
but there, I will not stop to tell any
thing but the story ' of Tad and the
sweet apples.
We went back to the place where we
had. talked before and Tad said that he

told him he would meet a bad bear win*

HIS CIPTS
-'BY MARY E. SACKETT.
SAN FRANCISCO.
ANDREW LANG was eight years
old. He had a kind papa and
mamma who could buy him al
most everything he wanted. He
lived In a nice â  house and had
nice clothes and loads of playthings.
But he knew there were a great many
.ittle boys who parents were too poor
to buy them what they needed, and he
bad been taught that he must always
i.- glad to give his toy? to them -and
help them in any. way he could. . Â,
One. day his mamma said: "Andrew,
would you like to go with me to the
Children's Hospital to-day?"
"Oh, yea, mamma. You know. I' told
poor, lame Johnnie Ford the last time
I was there 1 would come again as soon
as you would let me and bring him
something nice to play with." -
"And. Andrew:, there's that tiny tot,
Susie Lee. We must find her a pretty
picture book."
So Mrs. Lang and Andrew filled a
basket with toys and another with
oranges, apples and candy. -<--â¢'_
"Oh. mamma, Isn't, this like* what
papa was reading about this morning,
when Jesus sent his disciples nut in
pairs, -just as we two going together?
And I'm Andrew and you'll have to he
Peter, even if you are my mamma. Oh,
isn't it funny? Didn't your name use
to be Mollie Peters once?"
"Yes, Andrew; so we will go to-day
as Peter and Andrew, and think all
(he while that Jesus has sent us,, for
we really are going on his errand."
So they stepped into a cable car and
climbed one steep hill after another.
The Children's Hospital, was a large
white house, with pleasant windows on
every side, and the yard was full of
lovely flowers, roses, fuchsias, gera
niums, lilies and hosts of others. There
was a nice playground for the children
who were well enough to go out of
doors. * But Andrew and. his mamma
3 id not stop there. They went, upstairs
Into a large room with ever so "many
me." bellowed Corafix. i "Achoo, oh,
what' a delightful sneeze, achoo, achoo,"
came in the other giants in chorus. The
snuff got into their eyes and blinded
them; it filled the air and went, down
their throats and made them cough.
Corafix, searching for, his handkerchief,
.put.the Prince in one of his pockets.
The Prince saw his chance and cut his
way through the pocket with his sharp
sword, and drooped to the floor. The
giants were making so much noise with
their sneezing and coughing that they
did not bear him. He ran down stairs
as fast as ever he could. Just outside
of the door, he saw a lamb. He slew
this and dipping his coat in the blood,
put the coat on the lamb and dropped
it directly under Corafix's window.
With the coat he laid down his sword.
"There," -he said gaily, "when the
giants find my coat and lamb and hat
they will think that 'l am dead; now
for a new trick." So saying he ran
nimbly into the castle once more, where
the giants were still sneezing. Finding
a stout rope, he tied it across the head
of? the stairs. Then he went outside
of the- castle and beat upon a big drum
that. he found in the castle yard. Out
rushed the three giants to see lf the
King's army was coming, Kavalla be

few minutes. he guessed. . ... I don't know
whether he was getting a* littie fright
ened, r -but he. said* *Aii right: he- would
stay.". I. saw 'that' he wanted to run
a way! Just think of .that! Run away
from a nice bear like me! Did you ever
hear of a boy who was as bad as that?
Tad sat down upon a log and I sat
close up to him and tried to hint that I
wanted to eat some of the apples. ..As
soon as he tasted the first of the lot
he became very greedy. "Give me one,
Tad," I coaxed. He wouldn't give me
one, but ate them all himself. Now if
you had apples, my dears, and you and
I were together, and' l asked you for
one, you would give it to me, wouldn't
you. Eh? Yes, I thought that you
would. . â¢ â¢ â¢ '
Tad was a very bad boy. and you are
all very good boys and girls, as I can
easily see. When . I found that he was
so selfish and greedy I thought that I
would not sayanything more until he
had finished eating the apples.
"I guess I will go home, now," he'
said.
little beds with clean white spread*,
and in them were little children with
thin, white faces and thin, white hands;
not fresh rosy cheeks and plump, dim
pled hands like Andrew's. 'Some of the
children were sitting in chairs, .-a.: few
were playing around the; room, * but
something was the matter with all of
them.- Some had broken arms or legs,
some had been burned or hurt and some
were sick. Some had no fathers and
mothers, to take care of them, and
some of the parents were too poor to
pay. doctors and buy* medicine. This
pleasant- home. had been built by kind
people who loved --little children and
who ..hired nurses and - doctors - to try
and make them -well. again. v
'Andrew could not wait -to' speak to
anybody, but hurried along to the far
ther end of the room, where poor, lame
Johnnie Ford day propped .up -' with pil

to the bottom of the castle and broke
his neck and so died Kavalla.
Corafix and his brother escaped the
fall and got into the castle yard safely.
There they found the Prince's hat and
coat, blood stained,* and both believed
that the Prince had. tried to escape from
the castle by a window and had been
killed. They could not see very we!
"What, .you go home to your nice
little brothers and sisters, .you greedy
pig, and make them cry because you
would not bring them any apples? I
cannot bear to think that they will
have to cry to-night for apples." ' yy*
Perhaps you think that I was crack
ing a joke on my name when I said, "I
couldn't bear." He thought that I was
joking and started to run. Well, now,
Johnnie did laugh. And the children
who were playing around ran up to see,
and they laughed and clapped their
hands. And the little children In the
white beds raised their white faces. as
well as they could and tried their best
to laugh with the rest. Such a happy
lot as they wore, as Johnnie went
around and gave every girl and every
boy toys and picture books. They were*
all so happy they almost forgot for
a while their aches and. pains. When
it was time to leave Andrew went to
say. good-by to Johnnie Ford. "Oh,
Johnnie," said he, "I'm so happy. It's
better than Christmas. ' Papa tells me*
true when he says it is nicer to give
things away than to keep them." -y.
A PLOWER STORY.
ONE day the Chrysanthemum and
the Daisy were talking together,
and they were very angry with
the Rose.
Chrysanthemum": *"How Is it,
Daisy, I have so many beautiful dresses
of all colors, and you are so plain, and
yet -everybody is talking about -the
Rose?" ' -
"I don't know," said Daisy, "but I
hate her." 'â¢' ' â¢â¢ ' ; â¢
"Well, Chrysanthemum, I'll tell you
what we'll do. Weil watch for her and
tear, her. clothes off and throw her down
in the mud."
In a little while the Rose passed by
and Chrysanthemum and Daisy took
her and tore off all her white dress and
threw her down in the mud. Presently
Kingcup came by and saw the. Rose*;
He said: "Poor Rose, what is the
matter? Why are you lying in the
mud with -our clothes all torn? Can
I help you, poor Rose!" "â¢".
"Oh, yes, dear Kingcup," said the
Rose; "I - don't know why the flowers
hate - me, _ but Chrysanthemum and
Daisy quarreled with me and tore "off
my dress and left me here in the mud.
Please* help me. kind Kingcup." :;//';<
So the Kingcup lifted h?r up out of
the mud and .put on a beautiful red
dress and Rote was happy, again; and
the Kingcup and the Rose have been
friends ever since, and the Rose has al
most always worn a red, red dress.

the cat belonging to the giants, which
was the size of the lion, was not fooled
so easily. She smelled the Prince out
as he lay in hiding under the bushes in
the garden. While the two remaining
giants were talking about him, the cat.
holding him tightly in its teeth, brought
him' to them and laid him at the feet of
Corafix. . "Well. Mister little Prince
with nine lives, so here you are? Why
didn't you stay dead this time. It
would have been better for you, for
now we wifl ' put an end to you ; at
once." \Vrvy -'
There was a deep well in the castle
yard, and into, this Corafix threw . the
Prince without more' ado. The water
closed over his head. â¢â¢â '.'"-,
"Now.V said Corafix, "we have done
.with him forever, and the giants may
sleep well now, but what a lively little
villain he was, to be sure." * â¢â¢â¢
The Prince came up to the top of
the water and would have. sunk to the
bottom again had he not with light
ning speed put his sword crosswise of
the well. The sword bridged the well,
which was very narrow, but very deep.
By holding on to the sword, which was
caught fast in the sides of the well, the
Prince managed to keep his head above
water. He had little fear now but that,
when it was dark, he" would be able to
climb up out .of the well and continue
his attempts to get rid of the wicked
giants. But there was a huge frog who
lived in the bottom of the Well who be
gan to cry out: â¢â¢â¢â 'â¢ .* .'
'"Corafix. Corafix, the Prince is alive
in the well and will come out when it
is dark to kill you..". -
do you see those things on the ground?
Yes, you do. -Do ..you think that if a
bear asks you some day to give him a
few nice apples, when you have your
pockets full, you will: snake some excuse
so that you can eat them all 'yourself?
Just .think how children make, them
selves sick eating too much! Well, that
is all of the story that I feel tike tell
ing. In' fact I am too sleepy to talk
much more. I ate too much' dinner I
think. .What? .'you 'really say that Tad
has never been seen sinee 'he' went .'.up
on the hill with me to get apples?. .1
am afraid that you are telling the
truth. I heard that he -was. eaten -'up
by a very bad bear, and that when he
was all gone the bear smacked his lips
and said: What luck, I got the boy
and the apples, too, and did not have
any trouble to pick one or to catch the
other. ..,.yr-yy-
You think that I ate Tad up? I will
not answer any questions, but here is
a' snap shot of the situation and of my
self just after Tad went out of sight. I
do look to be a little fat â in that pic
tureâbut. never mind, Tad was a
greedy boy and he has not been greedy
since that day. He is completely cured

DORA'S VERY
QUEER SAIL
BY BEATRICE WELDON,
GRASS VALLEY.
DORA WILSON and Bessie Wil
liams were great friends and
were always together. One hot
summer eve about subset Dora's
mother was going to go to town
and let Dora stay at Bessie's place.
Bessie had a large yard and at the foot
of the yard was quite a large pond, and
a boat was always floating over Its
clear waters. Dora and Bessie went
to the pond for a boatride, but as it
happened when Dora and Bessie went
to the pond the boat w-s in the middle
of the pond. They stood there think
ing of some plan to get the boat.
At last Dora said: "I'll get in this
old tub and -you see If you can push
the tub and make it float over to the
boat." 7â¢; -i ' â  â¢â¢-
So Dora got into the tub. Bessie, in-

"Thank you, Mister Frog," said the
Prince, "you do not mean me any favor,
but you have given me an idea how I
can get the giants to help me out of
this place." ,?â¢';*
With his dagger he killed the frog.
With great .speed he stripped the skin
from the frog, taking care not to tear
the skin on the frog's back. He then
managed to get into the* frog's skin and
at once proceeded to carry out his new
plan. '.. Making his voice sound like the
frog's the Prince bawled at the top of
his voice: ."Corafix, the Prince is not
dead, but alive, in the bottom of the
stead of pushing the tub, pushed Dora,
who fell into the pond. For a mo
ment Dora was out of sight under the
water. The water was not deep and
she did not drown; but she was stream T

The two girls went to the house, where
Dora put on some of Bessie's clothes.

THE DOLLS' TEA.
BY ETHEL WINKLtR,
MERRY Christmas and Happy
New Year had passed. Old
Saata Claus had, at Christmas
time, unloaded his pack and
Hattie and. Myrtle each had a
new doll and a set of ; dishes. They
now thought that it was time for them
to have a doll's tea party. Hattie's doll
she had named Â« Gladys. . It ; had \ dark
hair arid eyes arid was dressed- in pink.
Myrtle called her doll Joyce. It had
golden hair and blue eyes; its dress wa3
blue.' â ; >'Â.'";? '.-'.'."â 
,The two girls got, out, a small, table
and placed upon it. a large ; towel for a
tablespread and then arrayed their nice
new dishes. .Soon they had the table
set for tea." â¢ Mamma gave them some
tea, -.with cake and nuts and candy; and
oranges which their auntie had sent
them for- Christmas.
.."I am the hostess," said Myrtle, "and
Joyce will help me to receive. Now
well. Pull me up and I will tell you
where he is." '..*;-' .. V-,.,:^
Corafix was deceived because the
voice seemed to-be the frog's. He de
termined to see that the Prince was
dead.
"Where is the Prince, good frog?" he
said, looking down into the well. "Pie
is down here," was the answer. "Quick,
pull me up before he can kill me."
"Very well, hop into the bucket," said
Corafix, "and I will."
So the Prince hopped into the bucket;
arid Corafix pulled him up to daylight!
once more. ;?V:y ;
"Go down, good Corafix, and kill
him," said the false frog, * "for if you
don't the Prince.. will, come Up after
dark and burn down your castle.". ; .
The giant needed no second prompt-;
ing. "How does the Prince keep his
head above water?" asked Corafix.
"Oh. that is easy. He has bridged,
the well with his sword and is resting l
upon that." ?"* ' a
The giant tore away the stones at the
top of the well furiously that he might:
have room to go down the well. ..*, He
fastened a rope to a tree that grew un-.
der the window of Lejundire's bedroom.
Down the well* he went holding to this
rope. Out of the frog skin slipped the
Prince and with his : sword, which he
had managed to stow away, in the frog
skin, he cut the rope. With a yell
Corafix fell to the bottom of the well.
The.re he was drowned and there, was
only one live giant at the castle. As

will sit down and have some tea.
Please help Gladys to some cake. Will
you not have an orange?"
"Thank you," answered Hattie; "I
will." â 
Then came the nuts and the candy.
"Joyce is enjoying herself immense
ly." said Myrtle; "she . thinks that
pound cake is just lovely. " She is ready
J
soon as Corafix "fell the. Prince threw
the frog's skin down after him, that
Lejundire might not find how he -had
tricked Corafix. Then he ran into a
hollow tree, ..where he hid until _ Le
jundire had run to the well and* had
gone sorrowfully away again, -shaking
his head and muttering as he walked
into the castle. yy ;
When Lejundire had gone into the
castle, Grundalkin, who had witnessed
all of this performance, suddenly came
to the' Prince. "Beware of the last
giant," she said, "for, my dear Prince,
Lejundire is the seventeenth son of a
seventeenth son,, and he is something
of a magician." ' "â ' â  Â'â¢â  â¢
"Oh," said -the Prince,- "is that all.
Well.- I don't care.". y
The Prince was happy at his success
so far. When he- heard the last of the
three giants bolt all the- doors of the
castle, he laughed aloud. Instantly the
giant's head popped out of a Window.
He Saw the Prince. "
"You little villain, wait there a min
ute and you will never go away." '
"No, thank you. Lejundire. I am not
receiving company to-day. Come some
other day. I am tired of such stupid
giants.as you are here and I am going
to take a holiday, but I will be back
and attend to you later." ' .
. .The Prince walked out through the
castle gate boldly. So much was â¢ the
giant afraid that this was - another
trick of the Prince's that he did not
dare to follow. But Lejundire had the
castle gate shut tight and fast when
the -Prince- was far down the road,
-whistling gayly to himself as he went
on his way to visit the miller's pretty
daughter. ' ' y â¢
"On the road he Was joined by Blood
fillikin, the dog once,, owned by the
Giant Gorbozo. = ;.
. " What, news, Bloodflllikin?" asked
the Prince. . : y^yyy\
"Lejundire has called in his raven to
work magic against you. Hurry across
the mill stream. The magic cannot
work 0n... the farther side of the
stream." â¢â¢â¢..'.
The Prince hastened and was over the
stream not a minute too soon. A raven
flew croaking over his head and then
wheeling several times in air, darted
off to tell Lejundire that even his at
tempt to entrap, the Prince by" magic,
before he could escape from the land of
the three brothers, had failed. ''â . .

Well, Hattie and Myrtle played all
afternoon, until they were afraid that
their dolls would surely be eating
so much. At last mamma came in and
told them that she. was going for a
drive; would they like to go? The two
little girls, put away their dolls and- tea
sets for the day and went to ride.

NEW YORKERS always want and
are willing to * pay for the best
of everything there is going. Men
and women ; blessed with a ple
thoric purse 'are more liberal in
buying flowers than they are in
expenditure for any other form of luxury.
It is a case of noblesse oblige. Society
has set its seal upon certain flowers as
appropriate for specified occasions, and
the man or woman .who wants the ap
proval of society must buy those flowers,
regardless of seasons.; That is why New
York has the best and most expensive
flower shops in the country. .That is why
rich New Yorkers have been asking their
florists for two days if there is any good
reason for Boston having a monopoly of
the magnificent Lawson carnation, even
if the devoted husband of the-' woman the
flower was named for did pay $30,000 for
the right to control production.
New York is going to have that carna
tion, sooner or later. Two of < the most
fashionable florists in town told me re
cently that there is no doubt of it. They
said that neither Mr. Peter Fisher, who
first produced the flower by : skillful graft
ing, nor Mr. Thomas F. Galvln, who acted
as agent and has made the carnation the
talk of the' whole country by judicious
booming, can prevent I that flower from
being duplicated here unless they lock
up their greenhouses and personally 1 In
spect each flower sent out. Even then it
would be possible to circumvent them.
Experienced ; commission i men ' I talked
with were .'inclined to pooh-pooh the
superiority of the Lawson carnation and
to regard the price paid â  by Mr. Lawson
as wildly extravagant. - They insisted that
carnations equally, fine are on the market
here now in limited quantities. But the
fashionable dealers" in cut | flowers tell a
different, story. The curiosity of their
customers is aroused about the Lawson
carnations. They want them, } and they
won't be happy until they get them.
The fuss made about this flower and the
extravagant, prices offered for it by New
York and Chicago flower fanciers has cre
ated a sort of carnation; mania, almost
similar to the famous;. tulip -mania that
turned the "sedate, steady/going people .-of
Holland upside down : in ; the â¢ seventeenth
HALES. .;'"|
century. Nothing in the history of flow
ers ever, approached that. Holland, espe
cially in the vicinity, of Haarlem, was
then and is now the home of the tulip
bulb. They are most sedulously cultivat
ed and form an important item in the ex
port budget. As a gambling mania, a wild
scramble of silly speculators, a chimera
that swallowed up entire fortunes of the
unlucky and on the other hand laid the
foundation of great Dutch fortunes that
exist to-day, the tulip mania rivals in his
tory the South. Sea bubble of England.
Men paid fabulous sums for a single bulb.
Admiration of the flower and interest in
Its culture was a secondary matter. No
one -Imagines, of course; that the carna
tion mania is going to assume any such
proportions as that, but there is no guess-,
ing to what extreme a fad will be carried
when richer New York once takes hold
of it. :; -
When the Lawson carnation was exhib
ited at the New York Florists' Club in
this city in March. 1898, no one could have
foretold for it the distinction it has
achieved . to-day. It scored, ninety-eight
points out of a possible hundred,, which
was considered good, but not remarkable.
The flower was exhibited here by Mr.
Fisher. The specimens shown then were
only about three inches , In diameter.
Since then the flower has been developed
to four and four and one-half inches. Its
color is a beautiful cerise pink. It has a
sturdy stem and most remarkable vital
ity. Some of the cut flowers have kept
perfectly fresh for fifteen, days.
Like a great many new plays and other
novelties, the Lawson pink was "tried on"
the smaller cities before It came. to. New
York. It was first exhibited in Horticul
tural Hall/Boston, about four years ago.
There it attracted so much attention that
it was decided to : put it on ' the | market.'
The original plant has multiplied with
succeeding years until there are now 8000
of them. The flower kept :on winning
prizes. No rival to it appeared. Its pe
culiar delicacy,' daintiness of \ coloring,
large size and unique arrangement of pet
als placed it in a j class jby J itself." The
natural tendency of the petals of a carna
tion is to draw Inward as the flower fades.

So far as the market tradeof the flower
le ! concerned ; the supply has never j been
equal' to "the demand. There ' Is hardly
any limit to the commercial possibilities
of the plant, because It 'ls- so i hardy, and
prolific. There is said to be a profit of $2
on every dozen grown, and the plants are
now yielding, fifty dozen a day. Orders
are received from all parts of this country
âNew ' York excepted hithertoâ and from
Europe. Mr. Gal says several Eng
lish noblemen have endeavored \to pur
chase slips from him,, but he has refused
them. He declares that under all circum
stances he Intends to hold I the" flower as
a Boston monopoly for ten or fifteen year 3

remains to be" seen.

| Among the flower fanciers who saw and
coveted the Lawton carnation was H. N.
Higginbotham. a rich mail of Chicago.
He offered 96000 for the entire stock. It
' was his intention to transfer the plants
1 to his Chicago^ greenhouses and change
! the name to the Higginbotham carnation.
, This offer was refused. Then two New
' York florists pooled their issues and of
! fered $5000 for a few." Slips. Their â¢ offer
was also refused. Then Mr. Lawson
! made up his mind that the flower should
not leave Boston. He has been for years
known to the trade as a large buyer of
: flowers. That is why the plant was named
i after his wife. Here is Mr. Lawson's
j letter giving his reasons for the purchase:
BOSTON, Mass.. Jan. 17. 1899.
My Dear Mr. Galvinâ l received
your note and have read the clip
pings, which show that one of the
great people, Mr. Higginbothan of
Chicago has offered . $6000 for the
right to change the name of the
queen of carnations. I agree with
you that the lovely flower should
not leave Boston, and it won't, if
lt is only a matter of dollars.
We all know that Chicago has
many, many things that our little
town has, not, and that her great
citizens should have about all they
reach for, but there are a few,
things that they must do without,
and one of theSe is the beautiful
flower you so kindly named for
Mrs. Lawson when it was name
less and unknown to Chicago great
ness. Those of us whose being has
been confined to our modest little
town, and whose aspirations and
ambitions -have been acquired from
and molded by her old fashioned
and simple traditions, should not
be disturbed or molested In the pos
session of the few things we love
and understand and that love and'
understand usâ our flowersâ
by the great people o. great Ciil-
cago.
I. will' pay you $7000, $1000 more
than Mr.' Higginbotham, for a
plant of the Mrs. Thomas W. Law
son carnation, with the understand
ing that I will present it Jto Â£ the
city, of Boston to be propagated at
its nurseries for display In Its pub-
gardens and for the benefit- of
the â  citizens of Boston, and not to
be sold, and with the understand
ing that you give to no one else the
right ; to propagate it or change its
name; or I will pay to you the sum
of $30,000, for the sole right to it
and j the 8000 plants you now have,
provided you will | continue to | han
dle the business of selling it on the
terms "; as -. stated .in yours of even
date, and provided' an expert ex
amination shows the returns as
stated in" your letter, of which >. I
have no doubt. : . '
Trusting that you will accept one

of my . offers if you contemplate
selling the whole or a part of Mr.

A Branch of the Order That Has a
Charming Personnel.
The announcement that there Is to be
an entertainment by Orinda Parlor of the
Native Daughters of the Golden West Is
sufficient to attract to: the place where it
is to be given an audience that will fill
the hall, and there was no deviation from
the general rule at its. grab : bag social
given last Thursday night in the banquet
hall of the Native Sons'"* building. It is
generally conceded that - the charming
personnel of the parlor, Is the; magnetism
that attracts the gentlemen to these gath
erings. There was presented â¢ for the en
joyment of those present -a- fine pro
gramme of the latest dances, ' and the
programme was interrupted only long
enough to give every one an opportunity
to grab a package from . the bag. - The
opening of .the packages created a great
deal of merriment, as in most cases each
received Â» something for which he or she
had no earthly use.
At the installation of the officers of this
parlor Mrs. Theodore Lunstedt, D. D.
G. P., there, was one feature that was
noteworthy.' That was that*; each of
those who assisted her in the capacity
of grand officer was, like herself, "perfect
