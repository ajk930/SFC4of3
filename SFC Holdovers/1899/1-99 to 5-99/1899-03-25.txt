REPORT OF VICTORY
OVER THE TAGALLOS
One Hundred Americans Said to Have
Been Killed and Wounded in the
Fighting.
NEW YORK, March 24. â The World to-morrow will print the following Manila cable un
der date of March 24:
"A sweeping victory over Agninaldo's forces has been won by United States troops.
"The total American loss is estimated at about 100, including killed and wounded.
"The Filipino loss is between 300 and 400^
"Major General Otis having completed plans for striking what he hoped would be a final,
crushing blow to the native rebellion, an advance was ordered this (Friday) morning.
"Brigadier General Otis' brigade was astir early, breaking camp quickly and getting ready
for a swift movement. The Third and Seventeenth regiments of United States Infantry, which
had gone aboard the transport Sherman, to be conveyed presumably to some point on the bay, dis
embarked to march to the front overland.
"The Twenty-second Regiment of United States Infantry and the Oregon volunteer regi
ment were among the first troops to be set out from this city for the scene of the impending
action to the north of Manila. The rebels had been expecting an advance movement for some
days. Their spies within our lines usually have kept them advised of the American plan of opera
tion. In this case the Filipinos knew they must make their most stubborn stand as the American
commander meant to wipe them out or disperse them and capture their capital at Malolos.
"The fighting to-day was desperate on the part of the Filipinos, and determined on the part
of the Americans. The result was disastrous to the rebels.

The American troops advanced on the double quick, yelling fiercely and occasionally dropping in the grass and
firing by volleys.
The natives stood until the Americans were within 200 yards of their position, and then broke and ran for the
woods. About thirty of them were killed in the outskirts and seventy of them on the roads.
The Montana and Kansas troops met the hottest resistance In a strip from which the rebels have greatly wor

The Plan of Campaign De

Special IMspatrh to The Call.
Call Headquarters Wellington Hotel.
Washington, March 24.
Major General Otis has practically
completed preparations for his forward
movement against the Filipinos, and
the authorities are hourly expecting ad
vices that the advance has begun.
Little is known here of General Otis'
plans beyond the fart that the rein
forcements which recently arrived are
being used to etrenghten the Paste
River line, established by General
.Whea ton's brigade.
In army circles there seems to be a
belief that General Otis will direct the
transportation of an expedition to the
northward of Malolos by water, and
endeavor to surround the insurgents.
This will be a difficult operation, how
ever, and fraught with danger, unless
the expedition should be sufficiently
Ftrong to defeat the entire Philippine
army if it should meet It.
Such a move would hem in the rebel
forces and compel them to give battle.
To the north would be this flying bri

the south, is well policed by tinclads,
' and with a strong line in positioff, occu
pied by Wheaton's brigade, would cut
off any movement in that direction;
while to the west the Bay of Manila is
closed by Dewey's vesselÃ.
General Otis, it is believed, will ad
vance from Manila upon the stronghold
of the Filipinos with a force number-
Ing between 20.000 and 25.000 men. The
forward movement has been in con
templation for several days, and it is
believed by army officers here and
those officials of the War office who
have been kept advised of the contem
plated movement, that the American
march into the insurgent lines has been
bo carefully planned there can be no

cablegrams referred mainly to the pro
gress of the preparations for battle
with the full strength of Aguinaldo's
forces. No instructions have been given
to General (His, the full responsibility
for the campaign being laid upon his
shoulders. The Department here wisely
concludes that hampering him, either
with orders or suggestions, at the pres
ent time would be entirely out of place.
Of one thing department officials are
absolutely certain, and this is that there
is to be a continued advance of the
American forces. A temporary victory
will be merely an episode of the for
ward movement. General Otis' troops
propose to press forward until the
American flag flies over the insurgent
capital at Malolos. It is not doubted
in official circles here that this an
nouncement will be forthcoming within
a very brief period.
Among the preparations which Gen
eral Otis has made is to obtain thirteen
former Spanish gunboats. An effort
i was made some time ago to buy th^s^
vessels, but the Spanish authorities pre
i ferred rather to accept a smaller price |
from a Hongkong firm than to sell i

VALOR OF AMERICANS
MANILA, March 24.â Two Spanish I
prisoners who have escaped from Polo
to the lines of the Kansas regiment re
port that the Filipinos have concen
trated their forces at Maiabon and |
Polo. They add that only Aguinaldo's
bodyguard is at Malolos, and that the j
rebel leaders apparently intend to stake |
their fortunes on a fight at Maiabon,
where it was expected an engagement
would take place yesterday. If de
feated, it Is further asserted, the rebels
intend to disperse to the swamps and
mountains.
The rebels were putting their bolo
men in front, believing that the bolo
men's charms will avert the bullets.
The bolo wielders of the Filipinos
greatly outnumber their riflemen. The ;
rebels are further said to have admitted <
that they cannot withstand the Ameri- |
can shells and bayonet charges.
The escaped Spaniards corroborated i
.the stories told of food shortage among
the rebels, and they added that the hos- j
pitals are short of supplies.
According to Filipino accounts a
thousand Americans have been killed
near Manila, the fatalities being)
especially heavy at Calocan. where !

madmen against a storm of bullets."

MANILA, March 24.â Following ar^
personal experiences of a traveler
through the rebel country from Mala
bon to Dagupan:
"I left Maiabon a fortnight aero and
arrived at Polo. From there I was Rent
back by a general, being badly treated.
I started again next day, walking, but
was halted by sentries. I said 'I passed
yesterday, why not to-day? 1 and wan
allowed to pass and arrived at the rail
way station at Meycanyan, where I
pot a train to Malolos.
"Aguinaldo guaranteed my safety
along the line of the railway. He ad
vised English residents to take a
steamer waiting at Sual. All the Eng
lish are allowed to leave, but two
Americans are held prisoners in Calum
pit, and daily undergo bad treatment.
"The natives are arrogant and have
no respect for Europeans. They re
epected Aguinaldo's pass, but spoke
loudly of how spies are tortured. The
entire population are under arms. They
are forbidden to plant any crops ex
cept rice.
"There is immense enthusiasm in the
Tagallo provinces. Farther north the
natives want peace. Food and money
are abundant. A large quantity of am
munition is being manufactured, the
principal depot being at Bacolor, In the
province of Pampangas.
"Every town is defended by good
trenches. Coast towns are deserted and
prepared for burning, if the Americans
attempt to land. Order is maintained
in the principal towns, but there are
reports of anarchy in the interior.
'"Chinese are often murdered and
robbed, and Spanish prisoners are
quartered in a town in the interior.
There are large numbers at San Fer
nando in the province of Pampangas.
"Luna, the Minister of War, is anti
foreign. He ordered foreigners to take
up arms on pain of death. Aguinaldo
obliged him to retire and Pantallon
Garcia took office. He is more cour
teous.
"The English embarked on the Sual
steamer and were unmolested. Man
agers of rice mills at Oerona and Ray
ambang and Mr. Higgins, manager of
the railway, remained behind to pro
tect their interests. Higgins haa no
authority. Insurgent leaders run the
railway and move the rails and bridges
to suit their plans.
"Many rich Filipinos at San Fer
nando wished to escape to Hongkong
for fear that the Americans will suspect
that they support the Insurgents. It is
firmly believed in the provinces that
the Americans have suffered great re
verses. The Insurgents are confident of
the ultimate success of Affuinaldo."

RECEPTION
Two Robbers Attack the
Angels Stage Near
Altaville.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, March 24. â Messenger
Jackson's rifle called a sudden halt on
a stage robber this evening at 8 o'clock,
a mile and a half this side of Altaville,
a suburb of Angels Camp. The stage
was approaching the mountain end of
the run when orders came from the side
of the road for the driver to draw rein.
Messengers Jackson and McConnell of
the Wells-Fargo service were inside the
stage and Driver Washburn was on the
seat. Hardly had the stage stopped be
fore their guns were at work. McCon
nell's shotgun missed fire, but Jack
son's rifle sent a bullet through one of
the robbers and the other ran.
The bullet struck the robber on the
left side of the breast and It is not
likely that he will live. He is described
as a young and slender man with a
black mustache. Though many people
of Angels Camp saw the robber after
fell and broke his leg. On his bed Is
a bucket, while the floor is covered
with tubs and utensils of all kinds to
catch the dripping rain which perme
ates the ceiling. His bedclothing is
.saturated, his room steams with foul
smelling moisture and his groaning
lips betoken the stress of agony
brought about by his miserable sur
roundings.
In an adjoining room lie three bed
ridden Chinamen, suffering the last
stages of the dread disease. There
are but three dry spots in the room
and these are, fortunately, large
enough to accommodate the three
beds. All around the apartment there
is a confused jumble of clothing,
utensils, medicine bottles and para
phernalia of the sick room, soaked
with the constantly dropping water
from the ceiling.
Across the hall and along the corri
dor is the women's ward. In a bed
protected by a waterproof cover lies
a young girl suffering from an ad
vanced stage of leprosy. The room
affords less protection than would a
common tent. In order to care for the
girl it became necessary to remove
her to another room â one occupied by
a patient who was not afflicted with
the blight of leprosy.
TIDAL WAVE CARRIES
DEATH TO HUNDREDS
IN THE SOUTH SEAS
VICTORIA, B. C. March 24.â
News has reached here from the
Solomons, via Sydney, by the
steamer Warrimoo, of an appall
ing calamity. A tidal wave,
caused by a tremendous submarine
eruption, swept several villages out of
existence and brought death to hun
dreds of the unfortunate natives of the
volcano-formed islands on the 17th of
last month.
The news was brought to Sydney by
the steamer Emu, which reached that
port after a voyage through the South
Sea groups just prior to the departure
of the Warrimoo. After some two
months' voyaging through the islands
the steamer was headed for Manihiki.
Here the officers were informed of the
depredations of the tidal wave. They
said the Emu experienced high seas,
though there was no wind to cause it.
the shooting he co-uld not be identified
and was evidently a stranger in the
country. A posse is out looking for the
second man, but no report has been re
ceived from it.
The wounded robber will tell nothing
of himself nor of his partner. Officials
of the express company do not say
whether there was any treasure on the
st.ige or not.
The wounded robber has been recog
nized as a woodchopper named Bob
Murphy.
Adjoining this room was one occu
pied by a half-demented old woman.
The same condition of moisture pre
vailed and the bed was tilted against
the wall in order to avoid, as much
as possible, the falling water. In the
center of the floor was a puddle' of
filthy water, while around the edges
was a reeking accumulation of foul
dirt.
But the story is the same over and
over again as the rooms are investi
gated, until the heart grows sick with
the horror of it all and the throat
tightens and the eyes moisten with
the contemplation of those who are
confined for no crime except mis
fortune, and who are punished
through the criminal neglect of the
city administration.
The entire place is a shame and
lasting disgrace to the city. The
rotting rafters preclude new shingles
and each fresh gust of wind sends
the old ones down to add to the ac
cumulation of debris in the yard. The
walls sag, bend and bulge under the
pressure of the superstructure, whose
sodden timbers have become too
heavy for the weakened support, and
strong props are necessary to keep
the whole affair from crumbling to
the ground.
Therefore the supposition is that a
tremendous submarine eruption oc
curred and lashed the seas into a great
wall of water..
The natives of Manihiki said they saw
the tidal wave when it was miles away.
It came out of the distance like a huge
black wall of water, as if it would
cover the whole island.
One of the native villages washed
away was a settlement of about forty j
huts. Small loss of life occurred here, :
as the natives, having been forewarned
by the roar of the approaching wave,
had taken to the bush.
Manihiki came out of the storm with ;
little damage, but one of the most i
beautiful isles of Oceanica was all but
Bwept off the face of the waters. This
was Rakahanga. It was counted as
one of the high islands of this part of
the Pacific, but, from all that could be
learned by the officers of the Emu, the
mountain of waves seems to have â 
swept it like a sea-level shore, and it I

had reached Manihiki it seemed that
the island had been devastated by the
flood, which had swept It of every ves

There were five villages on the island*
and not a thatch remained, nor was
there a native left to tell how the
islanders were swept from their
homes to a watery grave in that cha
otic wall of water.
Report also reached the Emu of
heavy losses of life and property on

CALIFORNIA BOYS
WHO FELL FIGHTING
OVERWHELMING ODDS
Two Brave Volunteers Ventured
Far Into the Insurgents'
Lines and Died
Like Heroes.
MANILA, Feb. 21.â The names of
two more California boys have
been added to the rapidly grow
ing death list of the regiment.
They are those of Privates An
tone D. Nilson and Rackard, both of
Company C, whose remains were
brought in from beyond Caloocan Sun
day, February 12. They had been miss
ing since Tuesday, the 7th, when in
: company with two comrades, all hay
; ing leave of absence, they joined a
company of the Kansas boys going to
the front. During a pause in the fir
j ing between our troops and the insur
: gents massed in the thick woods away
to the right of the railroad track and
beyond our new intrenchments the four
i slipped into a deep gorge unknown to
! any officer, and advanced a mile and a
; half beyond our lines, finally taking
! shelter behind a natural breastwork
' shaded by a tall bamboo, at the ex-
I treme end of the canyon. From here
they could easily look into the timber
I 100 yards in front and observe all
! movements of the enemy. What oc
| curred after reaching this point can
only be surmised. Brown and Dun
can, the two members of Company C,
who accompanied them, reported back
at company quarters Tuesday evening
I and stated that, being fired on by large
hodies of Insurgents in the timber,
they had retreated, leaving Nilson and
Rackard to follow. Their failure to re
port that two men were left behind to
the officers on our lines is deplored, as
the two dead soldiers could have un-
I doubtedly been rescued by our troops.
Saturday morning the bodies were
I seen by a scouting party from one of
'â  the batteries. Privates "William Shaw
! and Donald McMillan of Company C,
| First California, hearing of this and
surmising that it might be their two
missing comrades, started a private In
vestigation. Following the route the
dead men had taken they finally found
i the bodies, stripped of all clothing but
| their blue shirts, the insurgents having
taken everything worth taking. The
numerous empty cartridge shells
strewn about told their story for them.
; The two brave boys had sold their lives
! dearly, succumbing only to superior
! force or treachery. The supposition is
1 that one of the boys, probably Nilson,
was wounded early in the fight and the
other (Rackard) had remained to aid
him. Nilson possessed a fine revolver,
and when found held in one hand a
handkerchief saturated with blood, in
the other revolver cartridges. His
wounded arm prevented the use of his
i rifle.
Probably some of the enemy hidden
in the brush in their rear had crept up
' and shot them down. Shaw and Mc-
Millan stated that they could not tell
if the bodies had been mutilated, four
! days having elapsed since their death.
! Insurgents in the brush on the right
: caused the two boys to beat a retreat,
but a large force went out and brought
the bodies in on the 13th.
Full details have been received of the
! outbreak on the night of February 4.
For the past two months the First Ne
braska has been camped at Santa
i Masa which was practically on the
! firing line. The sentinels of the insur
-1 gents near the Nebraska outposts were
1 very close at several places, and for
' several nights previous to the first
â  firing an insurgent lieutenant had
i caused trouble near outpost No. 2 by
attempting to push his sentinels within
the Nebraska lines. Saturday evening,
: February 4, at 9 o'clock, the in
' surgent lieutenant advanced with a few
men and disregarded the challenge of
the sentinel near No. 2. Private Gray
son of Company B. after properly chal
â  lenging the advancing party, who paid
, i no attention to him, fired, killing the
FIRST BIG DERBY
OF THE SEASON
Crescent City Classic to
Be Run To-Day.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW ORLEANS, March 24.â The Cres
cent City Derby, the richest stake offered
by the Crescent City Jockey Club, Is to
be run to-morrow and will close the club's
winter meeting. The distance is a mile
and an eighth, and the prize $4000, of
which $3000 goes to the winner, $500 to the
second horse, $300 to the third and $200 to
the fourth. The conditions of the- weather
and track are perfect, and the field that
will face the starter promises one of the
best contests recorded for the New Or
leans classic. The starters, weights and
riders, as announced, are:
Kentucky Colonel 115 Littlefleld
Jolly Roger U6 N\ Turner
King Barleycorn 115 W. Martin
fcjlmer S 112 Bert Knapp
Hittlck 115 . . .'. Van Pusen
Queen of Song, who was regarded as a
certain starter, remains in Memphis, her
work being eclipsed by that of the colts
opposed to her. and which were also in
training at Montgomery Park. The Har
! dy Pardee people figured the Little Rock
game as easier than the one here, and the
colt has been shipped to that point.
No future books are open, and there is
consequently no positive means of flgur
j ing the odds on the starters, but public
i opinion makes A. H. and D. H. Morris'
candidate, Kentucky Colonel, a strong
: favorite. Elmer S. owned by C. K. Bur
dean, and Hittick. the property of George
C. Bennett, run coupled, both being train
ed in the same stable.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 25, 1899.
1 lieutenant and a private. The in
surgents returned the fire and retreat
ed. The battle really began when Ser
geant O. A. Curtis ordered his men to
fire upon a large body of the insurgents
who were attempting to cross the river
opposite his post. Volley after volley
was fired in brief succession, which
sent the insurgents back scrambling to
their fortifications. Sergeant Curtis
was wounded and compelled to retire.,
When the battle began the insurgents i
seemed to be ready, and the Nebraska
regiment was made the center of their^
attack. The American soldiers, ho\v- j
ever, stood them off, and positions
were held firmly all along the lir. \'
daylight Companies L, M and C, led
by Captain Hollingsworth, advanc
drive back the insurgents, who had ef
fected a crossing farther up the riwr ;
and had gained a position on the left
flank from which they poured a terrific
fire on the advancing line. The ad- ]
vance was made by rushes, and it was |
a magnificent sight to behold. The
command â¢'forward. guide center,"
could be plainly heard, and the long
line moved forward in as perfect order ,
tas though on drill. Notwithstanding
the fact that they had to advance a ;
quarter of a mile in plain view of the
enemy, who poured upon them a con
stant storm of bullets, the Nebraekans
drove the insurgents back to their boat
and across the river.
The Utah Battery, acting in conjunc
tion with the Nebraska troops, did
great service. The constant and fear
less forward movements of the Ameri
can troops seemed to strike terror to
the hearts of the insurgents, who. re
treated hastily, leaving seventy-nine
dead comrades behind a stone wall. It
was here that E. G. Edlund of Com
pany B was killed and Fred Kuhn of
Company C wounded. A Mauser bullet
passed through Captain Hollings
worth's hat.
There is general anxiety among the
patients of the brigade hospital to get
well so they can take their places at
the front. A close watch has to be kept
upon the delirious wounded, who are
constantly trying to escape from the
hospital. Some of the weakest willfully
deceive the nurses as to their condition
in the hope that they may be dis
charged before entirely mended. If the
hospital authorities would only alloW
it the firing line would be reinf
with every patient in the hospital who
is able to walk. The hospital is crowded
with wounded insurgents, who are
carefully attended by American sur
geons, and the captives seem to be sur
prised at the kindness of the men who
hold them prisoners.
The insurgents are using brass-coated
bullets, which inflict shocking wounds
whenever an American soldier is
struck. Blood poinoning almost in
variably results from a wound inflicted
by one of these bullets.
Thomas Bryan, a member of the j
California regiment, was shot through
the groin by a Remington. The wound
was not considered dangerous, but two
hours after he was brought in from !
the field blood poisoning set in, lock
jaw ensued and fifteen minutes later
Bryan was dead.
A report has reached here of the seiz
ure by the insurgents of the American j
steamers Saturnus, San Joaquln, Don j
Jose, Gloria and San Pedro, the captain
of the latter boat being murdered.
On February 12 Admiral Dewey. Cap
tain Lamberton of the Olympia and
several ladies went up the river in the
admiral's launch and visited San Pedro j
Macate. While at the headquarters -if
General King the insurgents sent a
shower of Mauser bullets whizzing all
around and the naval party hastily re
turned to the launch and went full
speed down the river, where the ladies
were out of danger.
[There is no such name as Rackard
given in the roster of the First Cali
fornia regiment. The nearest ap
proach to it is the name of Guy C.
Packer, an Oregon boy, given in the
list of recruits sent to Company C of j

POLICY FOR THE
PHILIPPINES
Will Not Be Announced
at Present.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
THOMASVILLE, Ga., March 24.â
The administration will not decide
upon Its permanent policy respecting
the Philippines until the Schurman
commission reports. It feels that its
present knowledge is too indefinite as
a basis for a fixed policy.
It comes from the highest source that
the permanent attitude of the Govern
ment will be left undecided until fur
ther knowledge of the islands can be
obtained, and the Republican conven
tion is much nearer. There will cer
tainly be no conclusion reached until
after the Schurman Commission re
ports.
An immediate decision Is felt to be
needless since for the present the only
problem is the restoration of law and
order and the establishment of stable,
peaceful conditions.
This and Ihe appointment of a diplo
matic representative at Madrid are two
of the most important matters remain
ing open. The Madrid mission prob
ably will be raised to an embassy soon
after payment of trie $20,000,000 in
demnity and a man of the highest
qualifications and attainments chosen
for this delicate and important post.
General Woodford may not be the new
envoy, owing to the fact that New
Tork already has such an undue pro
portion of the highest diplomatic ap
pointments.
The Presidential party, except Vice
President Hobart, m;ide a trip to Tal

SANTA ROSA, March 24.â Ong Foon,
charged with the murder of Ah Loy,
was acquitted to-day in Judge Bur
nett's' department of .he Superior
Court, the jury being out only twelve
minutes. â 
Ong Foon was accused of having killed
Ah Loy at Santa Rosa last year. He has
been a very much persecuted Chinaman,
according to the statements of the Rev.
Dr. Gardiner, Mrs. Lake and leading
members of the local Chinese organiza
tion, who positively asserted that the ac
cused has been the victim of the wrath
of highbinders of this city.
They claim that Foon was being rail
roaded to the gallows for a crime he
never committed by enemies who fear
him. They further stated that he has
boon a source of trouble Lo highbinders,
owners and brothel keepers by rea
son of the great aid given the missionary
societies in breaking up ihe slave, girl
traffic. It is said that Ong Foon has
been a marked man in highbinder circles
for the past year; that at the present
time $1000 has been placed on his head,
aril though he has escaped conviction he
will be either shot or stabbed by one of
his countrymen.

SEA SERPENT BOBS
UP ONCE AGAIN
MoQSter Two - Headed Sauriao
Said to h\a\te Been FÂ° und on
a South Sea IslaQd.
VICTORIA B C Marrh 24.â News was brought by the steamer
Warrlmoo. which arrived this afternoon, of the discovery of a supposed
sea BCTpeirt on Suwarrow. one of the islands of the Solomon group by
the steamer Emu of Sydney. The Emu. Captain Oliver, arrived at
Sydney juÂ«t prior to the departure of the Warrimoo with a portion of
the skeleton of the mysterious monster, which her master presented to
the Sydney Museum. It created a furor among: scientists of the Antip
odes, and when the liner left it is said an expedition was being arranged
to make further investigations.
The manner in which the strange find was made was told by the
Emu's captain as follows:
"After we left Manihikl we returned to Suwarrow on our way back
to Sydney and while there the natives carelessly remarked that 'one btg
devil-devil 1 from the sea had washed ashore a little way off two months
*go They did not know its name, only that it had two heads. We
went along the beach to where the gigantic animal lay, and long be
fore we reached the scene of the stranding the stench was so horrible
we were on the point of abandoning the 'catch.' On getting within sight
of it however Its extraordinary appearance determined us upon acquir
ing possession of it, and after perils by sea and worse dangers from the
poisoned air we secured the first sea serpent ever brought to Australia
âperhaps to any other place."
The monster, safd the Emu's officers, had one big body, but two
spines and two distinct heads. It was a pity, said Captain Oliver that
only the two heads, the two backbones and part of the ribs had been
secured, but to stay longer, he observed, would have nauseated the men,
perhaps, beyond recovery.
In their description of the sea monster all the Emus officers agree
They say that its hide or skin was of a brownish color and covered with
hair The heads somewhat resembled horse heads. The approximate
weight of the great sea serpent when the remains were taken aboard
the Emu is given at not less than seventy tons, its length fully sixty feet.
That similar sea dragons or serpents have, been reported is well known.
As the manager of the Pacific Islands Company, owners of the Emu.
PUt "Sensational sea-serpent stories have been repeated scores of times,
but there is no getting away from the actual heads and parts of the
frame of this animal secured at Suwarrow by our steamer and now on
board Whatever naturalists may think of the existence or non-exist
ence of this denizen of the sea depths, here are the proofs-the most in
teresting proofs from a zoological point of view on record.

Foon's defense. Before leaving she spoke
highly of the prisoner and told of the
persecution he has been subjected to at
the hands of his enemies during the past
Bi Â»Tâ¢e nt Jbbr fellow," said Mrs. Lake,

but the charge was so ridiculous that it
was - immediately dismissed.. Shortly
after 1 that he was accused of having at

victed. Their efforts, however, failed, as
It was proven that he was not at the
place named by the witnesses who ap
peared for the Prosecution at the time
they said he was and the charge against
him was dismissed by Judge M^n.
Foon had hardly stepped into the corri
dor of the City Hall when he as again
placed under arrest by Sheriff Grace of
Santa Rosa for having murdered Ah Do*

both feel that if they succeed in convict
ing this boy it will be the ruination of
our missionary work, as no Chinaman
will dare come forward and aid us in our
great undertaking. ,
"Ong Foon is one of the best bo>s I
ever knew. He. is honest and straight
forward, and when he told me t hat he
was never in Santa Rosa In his life I be
lieved him. He is simply being hounded
by his enemies, who fear him and who
wish to prevent him from interfering
with their traffic. He has also been of
great assistance to the Federal authori
ties in exposing the slave owners and Is
highly thought of by the officers of the
Government. Knowing him to be inno
cent of the terrible charge and being de
sirous of having Foon aid us in carrying
on our â  good work, the members of the
Methodist Mission will do their utmost
to prevent an innocent man from being
railroaded to the gallows."

AN APPEAL TO
AID TWO MILLION
STARVING PEOPLE
Wretched Condition of Chinese
in Districts Flooded by the
Yellow River.
NEW YORK, March 24.â Citizens of ]
the United States residing in Chefu,
China, have made an earnest appeal, j
through Consul Fowler at Chefu, to |

the appalling Yellow River floods of
this year. These floods have been de
scribed by the natives as "China's sor

never before was the distress so great j
and heartrending as now.
The most conservative estimates |
place .the number of starving at two j
millions, and time, and the increasing
crfld' weather will undoubtedly aug
ment the distress. The petitioners say
that they are daily, almost hourly, in
receipt of reports from their country
men in the interior depicting the condi- \
tion of the famine refugees. Hundreds
of villages are .submerged, cities sur- ;
rounded by water, homes, furniture, j
clothingâ in fact, everything is under
water or destroyed. The natives them
selves are living in straw huts and
many have absolutely no shelter from
the winter's cold and snow, subsisting
on bark, willow twigs, roots, etc. The
summer's crops have been a failure, the
seed for next spring's sowing is gone
and there is nothing for these starving ,
millions to hope for in the future.
"With our knowledge of the terrible )
want prevailing," says the American \
committee, "we venture to call upon the j
charitable in our home land to assist us .
in trying to alleviate at least a portion j
of this misery. ' Therefore, we shall be

chants and others on the Pacific. Coast
to contribute a steamer load of corn;
the natives of Shan Tung, unlike those
: down south, subsist upon corn, and we
â  believe that if the grain men of the
West will ship to the United States j
Consul at Cheefu direct' from the Pa- I
cine Slope a steamer loaded with corn
it will be the means of not only saving
| thousands of lives, but of opening a
market of from 25,000,000 to 30,000,000
consumers later on, as under normal
conditions American corn can easily
compete with native, and if this corn
be sent we guarantee that it will be
distributed under the direct and per
sonal supervision of Americans now re
siding in or near the submerged dis
tricts.
"We ask for money to be sent to the
United States Consul here with which j
food and clothing can be bought for the
sufferers, and we can guarantee a strict
accounting for every dollar received.
Shan Tung is peculiarly interesting to ;
American merchants as the best j
market for their products in ail China;
to the missionaries because there are
five denominations represented, com
prising 118 adults, scattered over this
vast province, and to whom we look to
assist us in distributing such relief as ,
we may receive. Probably in no other j
| place in the world, and probably not in |
j this generation, has there been so much
j suffering as is now being endured in
! Shan Tung. The natives .are doing all
j in their power; one firm in Chefu has i
1 contributed the equivalent of $70,000 in j
cash and 10,000 bags of corn, and all j
classes are contributing, but let us not j
forget there are 2,000,000 starving."

Supreme Court Decides in Favor of
the American Bakers' Union.
\fter many months the Supreme Court
has reached the case of Davttt & Daly ;
bakers, against the Germania Bayers
Union N0.51 in general and John J. Bar
rett its president, and other officers in
particular. Tho Judgment of the lower
court in favor of the union was affirmed.
\ vcar or so ago several owners oi ba
keries became entangled in difficulties
with the labor unions on' account of
hours wages, the employment ot non
union' bakers, etc.. and boycotts and
strikes followed, Davitt & Daly's bakery
coming in for its share of the ill-will and
condemnation. They began an action
againat the union and its officers for dam
ages and perpetual injunction.
The complaint set forth that the Ba
kers' Union and its members were inter
fering with the plaintiffs' employes and
attempting to force them by threats to
quit work. Also that the union was en
deavoring to injure their business by dis

OMITTED WORDS
NULLIFY THE ACT
Clerical Error Affecting
Los Angeles.
SALARIED OFFICIALS PROFIT
COUNTY GOVERNMENT BILL IS
DEFECTIVE.
Attempt to Reduce Salaries Fails,
and It Is Not Known Where
the Blame Should Be
Placed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, March 24.â Either by
accident or design the Los Angeles coun
ty government act has been nullified, and
that its purposes were defeated by those
most affected is the general belief here.
The omissions in the bill practically
mean dollars in some persons' pockets.
The bill was passed in response to a
general demand for a reduction in the
salaries of county officials, and tho <i -
mand was put into words by the Los An
geles County Republicans in a resolute n
i adopted in convention at the general r< -
quest of the business community. All
but two of the Los Angeles delegate a
worked to carry out the demand, and
thought they had succeeded. Because the
bill did not mention in what class <.J coun
; ties Los Angeles was it is held that the
I omission is fatal, and county officers may
! continue to draw the same salaries. Re
garding this. Assemblyman Mellck made
the following statement to-day:
"I don't believe the omission should be
considered a fatal defect in the bill. I
don't believe the court would hold it un
i constitutional if Governor Gage signed it
! and let it become a law. I don't know
! where the defect occurred, except that
it was before it reached the Assembly
it was a Senate bill. It passed with i
: throng of other bills in the wild nish
i There was absolutely no chance to look
it over We all knew its essential pi
visions, and had no doubt it was all right.
I suppose the omission was made at tne
' Printer's office before action on it by the
! Senate. It would be too bad, though, for
It to be killed because of an error which
is merely clerical."
Mead the only Democrat 1n the Los An
geles delegation, who introduced the
I county government bill in the Assembly,
said:
"I introduced the county government
bill in the Assembly. Bulla introduced
one in the Senate. My bill passed tha
Assembly with only one dissenting vote,
that being Miller of Los Angeles. W here
the fatal defect crept in I do not know.
I cannot say whether it was in the En
rollment Committee or before the bill
went to it. Ordinarily we would have ex
amined and followed up the bill and no
such mistake would have occurred, but
in the hurry of the last few days many
things were of necessity allowed to tak<i
care of themselves."

TALKS TO THE PRESS
NOT AFRAID OF AMERICAN
ABSORPTION.
View of Cecil Rhodes Interesting,
but Not Taken at All Seri
ously South of the
Border.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, March 24.
The new Mexican Embassador, Senor
Don Manuel Azpirez, who succeeds the
late Senor Romero, arrived in Wash
ington to-day. Senor Azpirez will be
the first representative of Mexico to
present credentials of the high rank of
Embassador. for while Senor Romero
way commissioned to that rank he
I died on the day set for the presenta
! tion of his credentials.
The new Embassador was seen at the
Mexican Embassy shortly after his ar
rival to-day and talked interestingly
on current questions between the
United Slates and Mexico. He Is a
man of quiet and dignified bearing, be
i yond the middle age, with gray hair
brushed back from his forehead. He
speaks English fairly well.
"I notice," said the Embassador,
"that your papers reproduce Mexican
â¢ press comments on the recent utter
' ances of Cecil Rhodos. prophesying the
absorption by the United States of
Central and South American countries.
But this press comment is purely un
official and in no way reflects the views
lof the Government. Mr. Rhodes is an
i interesting character and the papers
; were quick to seize upon his utter
ances, but it is nothing more than the
opinion of any private individual and
receives no serious attention beyond
that. Through' -nt Mexico the press
i and publ. -rely friendly to the
great republic to our north. "
The Embassador's attention was
! called to the statements of Correo
! Espanol. published at Mexico City, in
| reference to American depravity in
I Cuba.
"That is a Spanish paper," said he,
"and the views expressed are merely
those of the Spanish element. Under
; our liberal laws, giving freedom of
h and freedom of the press, con
siderable latitude is allowed In edito
iiscussion, just as it is under the
enlightened laws of the United States.
: But no significance should be attached
i to the utterances simply because they
I are made in Mexico City. Only a
i small element of our people are pro
i Spanish by reason of ancestry or rela
| tionship. The great bulk of the people
, treat such matters with indifference
and regard the United States as their
nearest and best friend."
The Embassador speaks in high
terms of the Americans in Mexico, and
says the country invites them as citi
zens and investors. Th.- American col
ony at Mexico City numbers about 500.
and Americans are scattered all
through the country, developing the
railways and mines.
Senor Azpirez is accompanied by his
wife and two daughters and by Cap
tain Barron, a newly appointed third
secretary of the Embassy.
DISCOVERS A
CARLOAD OF
DISEASED FOWL
The Health Inspectors
Make a Seizure.
For some time past the Board of Health
has suspected that diseased fowl was be
ing shipped here from the East, but it
was not until yesterday that positive evi
dence of the guilt of the Eastern ship
pers was obtained.
Accompanied by Food Inspector Dock- ,
Market Inspector Davis visited the :
railroad depot at Fourth and Townsend
a and proceeded to inspect a car
containing over 5000 pounds of dead fowl
which had been shipped from Omaha, j
They found the birds unfit for consump
tion and at once ordered them removed
10 the fertilizing works, where they were i
destroyed.
"Had thc-se fowl reached the market,"
said Inspector Davis, "J am satisfied that
the death rate would have been in
creased. The chickens particularly were
Bwollen and discolored, and s>cmed to
have been killed at least several weeks
ago. We have suspected for some time
that thf Eastern dealers used this city as
a sort of dumping-off place for their sur
plus fowl, but despite our efforts we
failed to obtain sufficient evidence
against them. As far as we know the
it-alers were the principal
buyers.
"Several days ago we learned that a
carload of diseased Cowl â  was en route !
here from Omaha and we determined to
keep a Bharp lookout for it. Just after
the car rolled into the depot we boarded
it, despite the protestations of the railroad
employs, and proceeded to make an in
vestigation. The diseased fowl was packed :
in barrels and crates.
"A cursory examination disclosed the fact
that the birds were unfit for consump
tion and we at once ordered the lot re- |
moved to the fertilizing works. Hereaf- r
ter each carload of food will be Inspected j
and if there is the least suspicion that j
the birds are diseased they will be con
demned and pent to the fertilizing works.

She was laid to rest on Sunday last with

to the dead Princess. On Friday morning
a private Bervice was held In the pres

forty-eight days from Newcastle, arrived
off port on the 15th with h#r cargo of
coal heated and in danger of fire break

The ship Is bound for San Francisco,
but in the condition of her cargo the cap
tain thought it dangerous to proceed
without an official investigation. So he
put in here. He applied to Collector of
Customs McStocker for the appointment
of a board of survey to investigate the
condition of the cargo. This application
at once brought up a legal complication.
The Star of Bengal is flying the Hawai
ian flag under a temporary register Is
sued by Consul Wilder at San Francisco.
The Government has refused to recognize
those temporary registers. To have ap
pointed a board or survey would have
been a recognition of this one by the Col
lector. Hut the ship having no other reg
ister could not apply to a Consul for the
appointment of a board. Collector Mc-
Stocker consulted with the Cabinet about
the matter, and it was decided that not
to embarrass the ship, her officers, char

DISAGREEMENT IN
HAWAII'S CABINET
Attorney General Smith Resigns as
the Result of Serious
Differences.
HONOLULU, March 18.â William O.
Smith, who has b^en Attorney General
since the overthrow of the monarchy, hns
requested President Dole to accept his
resignation, handed in last August. This
sudden withdrawal from the Cabinet is
the culmination of a serious disagreement
between the officers of the Cabinet. It is
claimed that Smith and President Dole
desired the retirement of James A. King,
the Minister of the Interior. Minister
Damon stood by King end declined to
vote for his dismissal. As it requires the
votes of three Cabinet officers to make a
change a deadlock was formed by Da
mon's stand. Smith saw no chance to
carry his point, so he decided to retire
from the Cabinet himself.
Henry' E. Cooper, the present Minister
of Foreign Affairs, probably will be ap
pointed to succeed Mr. Smith.

SANTIAGO DE CUBA, March 24.â
John Sherman has been safely moved
from the American line steamer Paris
to the quarters prepared for him on
board the United States cruiser Chi
cago. Mr. Sherman rested easy during
! the night and awoke cheerful and pre
! pared for the change.
The Chicago arrived here after day- {
light and preparations were immedi- j
ately made for the transfer of Mr. :
Sherman from the passenger vessel to |
the warship. He was carried on a j
stretcher, which was laid on one of
the boats of the Paris while in the
davits. The !>oat was then lowered into i
the w"ater and was taken in tow by
a steam launch. Two umbrella? were
placed over the sick man in order to
I pre% - ent the sun overheating him. Mr.
j Sherman was hoisted on board the Chi- '
j cago in the same manner. He was ac- i
j companied by F. B. Wiberg. Dr. Mr-
Gee and a nurse.
Immediately after Mr. Sherman had
been taken on board the Chicago the
Paris, with her party of tourists on
board, left for Cienfuegos. The Chicago
will leave here later in the morning.
Dr. Graff of the Paris, who examined !
! Mr. Sherman after he was transferred
to the Chicago, says both lungs are
. practically clear and that the patient
iis doing well. He praises the manner
in which the transfer was conducted,
under the direction of Chief Officer ,
Beckwith, who did not leave until he
saw Mr. Sherman comfortably installed
in the captain's cabin.
GAGE IS ROASTED
BY ORGANIZED LABOR
RUMOR THAT HE POCKETED A
BILL CAUSES TROUBLE.
LÂ«.bor Council Discusses Topics of In
terest â Settlement of Bill Post
ers' Strike Expected.
Governor Gage was roundly roasted at
the meeting of the San Francisco Labor
Council last night. Nothing was directly
developed to justify the roast; it was a
matter of insinuation and supposition.
The Pacific Coast Waiters' Association
had a bill introduced at the last session
of the Legislature which would practi
cally do away with employment agencies,
or at least relieve them of some features
which worklngmen have long considered
objectionable. The bill was passed and
la now in the hands of the Governor. At
the meeting of the Labor Council last
night Edward R. Moss, president of the
Waiters' Association, was given the
privilege of the floor and made the fol
lowing statement:
"As you all know, there was one bill
which "was indorsed by organized labor
everywhere and in which my union was
particularly interested. I speak of the
employment agency bill. Senator Ashe
and Assemblyman Lundquist made a no
ble fight for It and it is now in the Gov
ernor's hands. We have been Informed
that he intends to pocket the bill. He |
was Interviewed on this measure several j
times before election, and while he would
not commit himself, gave us to under
stand that he was favorable to it. Now i
he positively refuses us an audience. Our
committee has attempted to see him sev
eral times, but without success. We
finally .sent a messenger to his room and
the only response was a burst of indig
nation because we had ascertained what
room he was stopping in.
"We object to such treatment and pro
pose holding a mass meeting in Metropol-
Itan Temple, at which we wijl ex- j
lirt'^s our indignation. Gage has compro- (
mised his party chiefly, perhaps, because
Dan Burns has a collar around hi> neck,
but we will hold the party responsible.
Gentlemen. I hope you will co-operate
with us in this 'movement."
Members of the council spoke after Mr.
Moss, and thÂ» general sentiment was fa-:
vorable toward holding, a mass meeting to :
condemn the Governor in case he fails to
sign the bill.
At the same meeting the cigarmakers .
reported that the Treasury Department
bad reversed its former decision regard- ;
Ing leaf tobacco and that leaf tobacco ;
could now be purchased in any desirable
Quantity. Progress was also reported on I
the fight for the blue label.
The law and legislative committee re- j
ported that the eight-hour bill was now
In the hands of the Governor and the
prospects ure that he will sign It.
The committee on the bill posters'
strike reported progressively. The non
union foreman has promised to join the
union, and when he does the strike will,
in all probability, be declared off.
BIG COURSING EVENT.
One Hundred High-Class Dogs Will
Be Slipped at Union Park
'. To-Day.
A Sapling stake and a record-breaking
open stake will be run off at Union Park ;
to-day and to-morrow, a total of 112 nom
inations being entered at the drawing !
last Wednesday evening. With one or
two exceptions the performers in the
Sapling stake are new ones, making It a
difficult propositi6n to pick the winners.
In the open stake, 96 high-class grey
hounds are in the running, embracing the
cracks of this country, England, Ireland,
Australia and New Zealand. Over 50 of
the hounds have been stake-winners,
many of them many times over. The
talent is at sea in picking the ultimate
winner, although they figure Gladiator,
Jennie Wilson and Theron to be well up
in the money.
Curtis & Son's Chartist-Rockette sap
ling. Cash, is looked upon as a sure win
ner in the Sapling â¢ stake, with one of
Lopez' nominations as the runner-up.
In the rundown this afternoon the
short-enders look to have a great chance
to down the talent, and in the following
named courses luck will enter largely in
determining which dog will get the flag:
Boubrette vs. Jessie Moore, Woodbine
vs Lamplighter, Maud S vs. Lottie M,
Madge Wildfire vs. Minerva, Magnet vs.
Swedish. Maid of Erin vs. Scout, Myrtle
vs. Victor King, Victor Queen vs. Cross
patch, False Flatterer vs. Royal Prize,
Master Mat vs. Kid McCoy, Vanity Fair |
vs. Royal Flush and O. K. Capitol vs.
Lawrence.
On account of the large entry of dogs
this week, coursing . will commence
promptly at 11 o'clock to-day, when the
Sapling stake will be run down twice.
On the arrival of the 12:55 train from the
city the open stake will be run down .
once.
The railroad company will run a special
train to the park to-morrow at 12 o'clock
in ;>d lition to the regular 11 and I o'clock
trains. An extra train will also leave ;
the park on Sunday at 4:45 p. m. With i
48 crackerjacks left in the running for
Sunday, one of the greatest day's cours- i

GERMANY WANTS
CHAMBERS' SCALP
Berlin's Position as to
Samoa.
MAY MAKE SERIOUS TROUBLE
IF HE STAYS NEGOTIATIONS
END.
The Newspapers of the Kaiser's Cap
ital Take Bather a High Tone
in Discussing tho
Matter.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, March 25.â The Berlin cor
respondent of the Morning Post says:
"I am informed that Germany regards
the withdrawal of Chief Justice Cham
bers from Samoa as imperative, and
that a refusal on the part of the United
States to call him home would be equi
valent to the abandonment of negotia
tions concerning Samoa."
The Berlin correspondent of the Dally
X-'.vs says: "I learn from a well-in
formed official that Germany is desir
ous of an amicable understanding on
the Samoan question. The Government
does not altogether approve the Ger
man petition from Samoa, and certainly
did not inspire its protests. However,
the Government is determined not to
allow German rights to be encroached
on. It will abide by the treaty, taking
no initiative for its alteration or abro-.
gation."
BERLIN, March 24.â The newspapers
here aggressively discuss the Samoan
question and a portion of the press
maintains that Germany must ade
quately protect German interests there.
The semi-official Post, referring to
Germany's proposal to recall all the
tripartite representatives in Samoa,
says: "This is the wisest thing all
around, as then new arrangements
would be much easier for all concerned
and it does not involve the humiliation
of anybody."
The Lokal Anzeiger, Boesen Courier
and Cologne Gazette express amaze
ment that neither America nor Great
Britain is willing to show good will
toward Germany in the matter.
SPAIN HAS NO
FEAR OF CARLISTS
LONDON, March 25.â The Madrid
correspondent of the Daily Chronicle
says: "Senor Silvela, the Premier, has
informed the Queen Regent that the
ratification of the peace treaty, by ac
celerating the payment of the $20,000,000
promised by the Americans, has Im
proved the commerical outlook abroad
and that there is nothing whatever to
fear from the Carlists."

FAT PLACE FOR
SOME REA MAN
Scramble for Office at
San Jose.
AUDITOR WILL BE NAMED
EX-BOSS CAN DICTATE TH;S AP
POINTMENT.
Would Like to Select "Johnnie" Mac
kenzie, but Fears the Wrath
of the County's Tax
payers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX JOSE, March There is a lively
scramble among idle politicians for the
position of County Auditor made vacant
by the death of A. L. Veuve. Candidates
for the place are bringing every "pull"
to bear on the Supervisors, who have the
naming of the officer. The salary is $4000
a year, and this is too rich a plum to go
begging, especially when so many of the
â¢'gang push" are without jobs. There
are a dozen candidates, and among these
is no less a personage than Rea's lieu
tenant, John D. Mackenzie. L. A. Sage,
chairman of the Republican County Cen
tral Committee; Police Commissioner
Thomas Morrison, ex-Justice of Peace W.
J. Kirkpatrick, Deputy City Treasurer
Elmer Cottle, ex-County Auditor W. F.
Parker, Supervisor Paul P. Austin and
some minor lights are in the race. It can
be seen that the chronic office holder is
-well represented in the contest and Is
willing to sacrifice "any old mint?" he
has been compelled to take since the
gang's rout last fall.
Veuve's friends are active, and they are
championing Mrs. Veuve's claim to the
office. They are trying to secure a dep- j
myship for the widow or her daughter,
Miss Eugenic Veuve, and it is more than j
likely that any one appointed Auditor
will get the place with this understand- i
ing. Veuve left no estate and Mrs. !
Veuve has been left with tour children j
dependent upon her.
Veuve was elected on the fusion ticket
of the Democrats, Populists and Repub
lican Good Government League last No
vember. He had served but three months,
ana this leaves nearly a full four years i
term for his successor. The Board of
Supervisors is composed of four Repub
licans and one Democrat. Rea controls
three votes in the boardâ P. Austin, G.
E. Rea and F. M. Sternâ and he will un- ]
doubtedly dictate the appointment. His
first choice is Mackenzie, his second L.
A. Sage. The appointment of Mackenzie
would cause an awful hue to go up from I
the taxpayers. Mackenzie occupied the |
office 01 Game Warden for several years j
and was a leech on the public treasury i
to the extent of $100 a month. H,o was j
finally ousted from this fat place. An at- >
tempt was then made to provide for him !
by making him License Collector under j
Senator Storehouse's amendment to the
county government act. Now he is mak
ing a fight for Auditor. Mackenzie has
promised to give Miss Veuve a deputy
ship in the office. The only thing to pre
vent him getting the place will be the in
dignation it would arouse among the cit
izens. With Mackenzie out of the race i
Sage stands a good chance.
Ex-Justice of the Peace Kirkpatrick and
Mackenzie must be provided for by the
"gang." Several combinations would do j
this. One is to give the Auditorship to j
Kirkpatrick, who would do all the work
and make Mackenzie deputy with the i
major part of the salary. Another is to i
give it to Deputy Treasurer Cottle, who ;
is best qualified of all the candidates. He I
is to make Mackenzie deputy and Kirk
patrick would get his place in the city
treasury.
The appointment of an Auditor will bo j
made by the Supervisors on Monday.
There is a stir in political circles also i
over Postmaster Hawley's appointment !
of an assistant- J. L. E. Kelly, who held ;
the place under Postmaster Ryland, and j
who is a Democrat, has been retained.
Hawley is a Republican and a war vet- ]
eran, and just why he should retain j
Kelly, when there are bo many good Re- i
publicans at leisure, is causing much com- i
ment. Kelly says his appointment is
permanent. T. R. Weaver was promi- !
nently mentioned for the place undei I
Hawley, but for some reason he was j
"thrown down." - - .
JUNIORS OF STANFORD
OBSERVE CLASS DAY
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March 25.â
The juniors held sway in college to-day
and celebrated their class day in a way 1
that showed that the custom, unobserved j
for three years on account of faculty in
tervention, was still dear to the under
graduate heart. There were disappoint
ments, but the celebration was not seri
ously interfered with. The rain made it
impossible to hold the interclass baseball
game, by which the juniors hoped to add
luster to the festivities by winning from
the sophomores the championship of the
diamond. President Harper could not
keep his engagement, but will speak to
the class of '00 to-morrow.
The farce, "Golf and Politics," proved
a decided success. It was written by
John 8. Briscoe '00, and was full of
amusing situations, being the story of
how a fat man, deep in debt, avoided his
creditors, lined up the discordant ele
ments in college politics, thereby win
ning a student DOdy office and the favor
of a rich and family proud aunt, who set
tles his indebtedness. The cast of char
acters was as follows:

THE DELUGE YET UNCHECKED
SAN JOAQUIN
IS RISING AN
INCH AN HOUR
Within Three Feet of the
Top of the Levee at
Stockton.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
STOCKTON, March 24.â The Cala
veras River has gone over the banks
at Clowe's place northwest of town and
the French Camp toll road southeast of
the town is under water in several
places. The channels here continue to
rise. The San Joaquin River is rising
an inch an hour, and it is within three
feet of the top of the levee. It will
reach the danger point at daylight.
Minor channel, which is a raging tor
rent, is pouring a great volume of water
into the head of Stockton channel
through McLeods Lake. Mormon chan
nel, which is running bank full, is flow
ing into Stockton channel a mile farther
down.
The low places to the south of the
Tesla coal bunkers are u'ider water and
water Is flooding the streets in the
neighborhood of the ship yards on the
north bank of Stockton channel. Cel
lars and basementÃ all over town are
beginning to fill and merchants are
moving their stocks to higher floors.
A special message to the Mail this
morning said that water was beginning
to come into Linden, which is east of
Stockton, and fears were expressed that
the large volume of water coming down
] from the mountains would flood con
â  siderable of the country in. that vicin
ity. The chief source of danger is from
the volume of water coming from the
| mountains by reason of melting snows
I and heavy rains.
A special telephone message to the
Mail from Mr. Mender of Sonora says
the Tuolumnc- and Stanislaus rivers are
higher now than they have been since
the heavy winter of ISB9-'9O. A heavy
rain is prevailing with a southwest
wind and a low barometer. The rainfall
for the past twenty-four hours, ending
at 10 o'clock this morning, was 2.23,
! lu.6y for the storm and 24.38 for the
season. The fall for the season last
year was 20. 4 LHe said the country
I for twenty miles back was getting a
I good wetting. These figures indicate
j that an immense body of water is com
i ing this way, and should reach this
| part of the country some time to-night.
William F. Mackey, the Milton agent
i for Cross & Meyers, the freighters, lo
cated at Jamestown, was in Stockton
to-day. He reported that the Calaveras
River was rising at the rate of a foot
every four hours. Six inches .of rain
fell at Tuolumne yesterday, and the
snow, which had fallen in large quan
i titles the past few days in the foothills,
' was melting rapidly. The weather was
i warm there. He reported high water
; all the way between here and Milton,
; which is twenty-four miles east of
I Stockton.
Sheriff Sibley reports the Mormon
l channel levee, which extends five miles
! east of Stockton, has been tampered
I with in efforts to irrigate.
A pest appeared to-day on the low
lands which is causing the owners of
i the partially submerged wheat fields
| much apprehension. The trouble comes
i in the form of countless thousands of
j wild geese. During the day clouds of
< "honkers" seemed to blow in from
| every point of the compass and came
] with a rush and noise. They settled
i on the growing grain wherever it was
: visible, and, not content with nipping
i it at the ground, took it out by the
! roots. Farmers at many points turned
I out with dogs and guns and killed right
! and left, but did not seem able to ter
rify the winged army. It would leave
one point only to alight at another and
resume its depredations. As the water
i stands in pools all over the lowlands
| the geese had a decided advantage over
the farmers. On the Moss tract, where
there are hundreds of acres in fine
grain, the pest appeared in black clouds
I and manifested appreciation of the fine
j feed by an ear-splitting chorus. A few
! years ago about the time the high
' water was subsiding geese devastated
i hundreds of acres. Many who have
I fortunes at stake will be uneasy till
i the geese seek other boarding quarters.
j Old-timers say the appearance of the
geese is a sure sign of overflow and
! floods.
The farmers of the eastern and north
ern parts of this county did no or-
I ganized praying for rain, but now they |
I have a movement under way to give a
j big "blow-out" in honor of the kind
dispensation of providence in opening
' the clouds during the past week. La
-1 fayette Funk, a prominent farmer from
i the vicinity of Farmington, was in this
I city to-day. He said the farmers wouTd
hold a big barbecue as soon as the
weather settled. The idea, proposed by
himself, had been received favorably
and chickens, cattle and sheep are
pledged for the jollification.
"I tell you," said Mr. Funk, "we were
in the last trench, no mistake about
that. I never saw the grain fail so fast
as it did in the three or four days pre
ceding the rain. If the storm "had held
off a little while longer It would have
been too late."
Stage Lost in a Torrent.
CAYTTCOS. March 24.â Stage-driver C.
J. Unehan left Cambria for Cayucos on
time this morning. At Villa Creek he en
countered a raging torrent due to the re
rent rains. He attempted to cross, when
his horses went beyond their depth. Tho
stage filled with water and began drifting
and rolling. Linehan tied the mail sack
to the reins, cut the traces and then
struck the horses and jumped. They
quickly reached high ground and brought
Linehan and the mall sack to land, while
the stage went rolling toward the ocean,
only a few hundred yards distant. There
were no passengers. Everything aboard
the stage was lost. Linehan walked half
a mile and secured a conveyance, arriving
here nearly on time. No mall has gone
south for two days and none went north
to-day. Every stream Is booming. It has
rained steadily for sixty hours. The rain
fall for the season Is fifteen Inches; for
the Btorm, eight inches.
Boats in Use on the Streets.
WATSONVILLE, March 24.â Pa.jaro
River overflowed its banks last evening,
submerging the lower part of town. On
Bridge street and Lower Main .Btre^t
boats are being used. Not since 1890 has
the river been so high. Pajaro River is
now a raging torrent and greatly endan
ders the railroad bridge on the Santa
Cruz line. Men are now guarding the
bridge. Many bridges throughout the
county have been washed away. Over
twenty-one inches of rain have fallen here
for the peason. At 6 o'clock p. m. it is
BttU raining, with every indication of a
continuance through the night.
Alvarado Is Inundated.
DECOTO. March 24.â Since March 15 up
to 7 o'clock to-night about seven inches of
rain has fallen In this section. Every
creek Is full. At Alvarado the ;lood Is
very high and portions of the track on
the sugar mill spur Is washed out. The
town is under water and the Chinese resi
dents are "roosting" on the tope of
houses. There is evt>ry Indication to-night
tor more rain.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, M ARCH 25, 1899.

RENO, New, March 24.â A petition is being circulated In Reno asking the people of Los Angeles to quit
praying for rain. This section has more than enough.
BIG LOG BOOM
CARRIED AWAY
BY THE FLOOD
The American River Is a \
Raging Torrent and \
Rising Rapidly.
Social Dispatch to The Call.
, SACRAMENTO, March 24. â The
American River, swollen by the late
and long-continued rainstorm, is on the
rampage and is a wild, rushing torrent,
especially in the neighborhood of Pol
som. Word was received here to-day
that water was pouring over the great
stone dam at the Folsom Prison last
night to a depth of fifteen feet and at
last accounts was rising rapidly.
A short distance above the dam the
American River Land and Lumber
Company had a great : log boom, which
was held together by cables. The
waters rushed down the American
River so swiftly yesterday that the

In Santa Clara Valley.
SAN JOSE, March 24.-But little rain
fell here last night. There was a steady
fall all day yesterday, but as night came
on it ceased. so the total tor
the twenty-four hours ending at Â»
rrf the valley there was a heavy fall, ana
down the .valley millions of gallons were
take" out by the irrigating dtiches. As
a. result none of the creeks were out of
fhelr banks in San Jose, but down toward
Alvlso all the lowlands have more or less
overflow water. As yet , no damage has
been done even there. Unless the water
gits deeper and stays so for some time
even the small amount of grain caught is
not seriously hurt. The fear now is that
"ho storm may continue. The ground is
thoroughly soaked and irrigating ditches
are full. The water which falls now must
largely run off to the bay. If the fall
in the mountains should be as heavy the
next twenty-four hours as in the past all
creeks through towns probably will be
away out of their banks. No alarm ex
ists as vet, since there havo been but
light and intermittent showers to-day.
The narrow gauge railroad is having
trouble with landslides, and it may be
some days before the road is fully
cleared. The good done by the rain in
this valley is beyond calculation, and
everybody Is overjoyed. Gilroy has had
several overflows in the last two days,
but no material damage was done.

no damage to the lowland from the over
flow so far ns heard. There is little or no
wind accompanying the storm. Fruit is

Stanford-Berkeley Field Day.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 25.â
Managers Culver of Stanford and Frank

terday and fixed the date for the intercol
legiate field day at April 22. They decided
to hold the meet at one of the colleges,
thus taking a step toward holding all ath
letic contests on college grounds. Each
manager wants the contest to take place
on his own campus. The affair will prob
ably be settled by holding the Held flay
on the Berkeley track, as it is more con
veniently situated for San Francisco sup
porters of intercollegiate contests.

REDDING LEFT
WITHOUT MEANS
TO FIGHT FIRE
City Water Mains Carried
Out by the Waters of
Calaboose Creek.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
REDDING, March 24.â After a steady
downpour extending over several days
a Beries of rain squalls of unprecedent
ed violence broke over this city this
afternoon and flooded the streets with
an inch and a half of water within a
couple of hours. It was the hardest
rainstorm experienced in years. The
damage at this hour is hard to calcu
late. So far as arc lights are concerned
the town is in darkness to-night. The
Sacramento River has reached a stage
which renders the water power plant
useless. Back water has Hooded the
pump rooms. By use of the auxiliary
steam plant the incandescent circuit is
working all right, but an alarming
feature has now presented itself by the
breaking of the city water mains.
Should a fire break out the town would
be at its mercy.
Calaboose Creek, which flows through
the city, taking up all the flood waters,
has become a torrential stream, wash
ing out 200 feet of the water main lead
ing from the pumping station into the
city. It will be several days before the
damage can be repaired.
The river road from Redding to Mid
dle Creek is under water in many
places and bad washouts are reported.
Until the flood recedes travel by this
important route will have to be sus
pended. Reports from the east side in
dicate that Churn Creek and Stillwater
reached the highest stage recorded in
three years. Many drownings have oc
curred in these creeks, but both streams
are now spanned by county bridges.
The storm came from the southeast
and was apparently central over Red
ding. Peal after peal of thunder ac
companied the downpour.
This extraordinary precipitation, ex
tending over a vast watershed, will
doubtless send the Sacramento River
up to and perhaps beyond the highest
water mark. With a hundred swollen
creeks pouring their muddy floods into
it, the river is rising rapidly and is al
ready impassable at the free bridge,
as a stream 100 feet wide that would
swim a horse is racing across the east
side approach.
VANDERBILT'S DINNER
TO COLLEGE FRIENDS
In the Center of an Oval Table Ducks
and Gold Fish Swam in
Pools.
NEW YORK, March 24.â William K.
Vanderbllt Jr., whose marriage with Miss
Virginia F;Ur is to occur on April 4, gave
his farewell bachelor dinner to-night at
Sherry's. His guests, with few excep
tions, were classmates of his at Harvard.
The arrangements for the dinner were
unique. The repast was served in the
marble palm room or conservatory, just
off the main ballroom. Here was arranged
an oval table, hollow in the center, the
space being largely filled with two pools
of water, in which swam ducks and gold
fish. Between the pools was a cluster of
azaleas, in the midit of which played an
electric fountain. Around the inner edge
of the table was a border of potted
daisies and spring violets. The walls of
the palm room were covered with growing
vines of Japanese asparagus, and here
and there were hung cages containing
canary birds, which sang throughout the
dinner.
There was an Hungarian band stationed
just outside the palm room, but no other
music. Mr. and Mrs. Oelrichs, Miss Fair
and Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont dropped in
for a short time about an hour before din
ner to take a look at the table.
INDIGNATION MEETINGS

KINGSTON, Jamaica, March 24.â After
two days of anxiety, during 1 which busi
ness has suffered, the people being en
gaged in attending indignation meetings,
it is said that the Government has real
ized that its choice lay between the ex
ercise of force and a compromise. There
fore negotiations were begun yeaterday
looking to a modification of the obnoxious
tariff, bill taxing Industrial implements
and literature which the Government is
connected with, intending to pass through
the Council with the help of four new of
ficial members who are said to -have been
appointed in order to outvote the repre
sentatives. It is said that the negotia
tions have been unsuccessful up to the
present beyond securing an adjournment
oi the matter until April 1
DAMAGE DONE
BY THE FLOOD
AT SANTA CRUZ
Electric Power Is Shut Off,
Leaving the City in
Darkness.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ, March 24.â 1t has
been raining all day, and at times the
rain fell in torrents. San Lorenzo
River has receded, but news comes
from all parts of the country of dam
age from the storm. The Big Tree
road is impassable between Santa Cruz
and Felton. There was an immense
slide at Rocky Point, and all the
travel is over Graham Hill road. A
'citizen from Felton estimates that it
will take $1000 to repair the road. The
road between Felton and Boulder
Creek is washed out. Telephone and
mail service between these places has
been cut off. Boulder Creek reports
sixteen inches of rain for this Btorm up
to this morning, and for the season
50.65 inches, against 19.78 last year at
the same time. Felton reports sixteen
inches for the storm.
At Gold Gulch the mountain side
seems to be moving, and an avalanche
is feared.
The road up the coast is in bad con
dition. The water at Lriddell Creek
washed the county bridge out to the
ocean. The Bonny Doon road is impas
sable, and the mail carrier for the first
time since the postoffice was estab
lished ' could not carry the mail.
On account of the high water at Big
Creek no electric power is furnished,
and in consequence Santa Cruz is in
darkness and without electric car ser
vice or any power to operate the powder
works. At the powder works a por
tion of the flume has been washed
away and the dam of the Hihn Water
Works on Branciforte Creek has been
carried out.
The narrow gauge road is still
blocked and no trains arrived or left
this city to-day. The broad gauge was
almost as uncertain. The San Fran
cisco morning papers did not arrive un
til after 4 o'clock this afternoon, the
train being over two hours late. The
track beyond San Andreas was under
water for two miles, and passengers,
express and mail were transferred on
handcars.
At one time to-day all the telephone
lines to San Francisco, San Jose, Wat
sonville. Boulder Creek and Big Creek
were down;
LIBRARY TRUSTEES ARE '
ASKED TO RESIGN
Los Angeles' Mayor Warmly Cham
pioning the Cause of Mrs.
Wadleigh.
LOS ANGELES, March 24.â The merry
war between the trustees of the Public*
Library and Mrs. Harriet C. Wadlelgh,
librarian, into which Mayor Eaton has
Injected himself, continues. Mayor Eaton
has asked for the resignations of the li
brary board.
"I do not believe," said the Mayor, "the
present board Is doing the public any
service. The sooner its work is brought
to a close the better for everybody. Cer
tainly the board members are not doing
themselves any good by a continuation of
this fight. I have asked them to resisn.
I am confident they will do so at to-mor
row's meeting. If they do not, I will
make an effort to see that they are re
moved."
It is whispered around the City Hall
that Councflman Toll tried to get the
members of the Council together for a
special meeting. If he had been able to
round up his colleagues and induce Presi
dent Silver to cull the meeting there
would be no library board to-day. Cer
tain members of the library board for a
time were "on the anxtmis seat." Some
were closeted early in the office of Presi
dent Dockweiler. The board members
are not anxious to be forced out.
When President Dockweiler approached
Mrs. Wadleigh and demanded the keys,
books and papers, Mrs. Wadleigh replied
with emphasis:
"1 absolutely decline to turn over thÂ«
keys to you, Mr. Dockweiler, and further,
I wish to say that I refuse to recognize
your demand on the ground that you have
failed to observe your own laws. The
board has declared that I am no longer
librarian, but it has not shown that 'good
cause' which its laws demand and which
right and justice demand. Until that
time I maintain that I am still librarian,
and a mere resolution voted does not alter
the fact."

HARVARD'S STRONG MAN
Acknowledges Debt of Gratitude to
Paine's Celery Compound.
(PHOTOGRAPHED BY GLINKS.)
Strong muscles and strong nerve* go together. A t A r oÂ«Â«Â«wi
Carl G. Herbert is the best developed man at Harvard to-day, accord-
ing to Dr.' Sargeant, the University's professor of physical culture and di-
rector^ Â°HerberT n^ n 1 a v e?'Paine's celery compound to be the most wonderful
preparation in the world for strengthening the body and enabling it to
withstand great mental and physical exertion. He has consented to the
publication of the following letter: Â ....
Cambridge, Mass., Jan. 16, 1899.
Wells. Richardson & Co.: I feel constrained, owing to the benefits I have
derived from your incomparable remedy, Paine's celery compound, to w rite
and tell you in what manner I have been benefited by it As i jou are
doubtless aware, an athlete's success is due very much to his condition or
form, and that perfect condition or form depends much on condition of
his stomach. I feel, and know by experience that Paine celery compound
is the ideal remedy for that purpose, as it not only strengthens the nervous
system, which is so essential to good health, but we find that it regulates
the entire system, and renders it in a condition to withstand either great
mental strain or physical exertion. I stand, at present, at the head of the
list of the Sargeant test of Harvard College, and am about to compete
again this year. As a preliminary to the actual training I have taken two
bottles of Paine's celery compound and know that with its aid I shall beat
my own record this year, as I am now able with no other training to lift
many pounds more than before I commenced taking the compound. Pos-
eibly you may be interested in the forthcoming test and I will take pleasure
in informing you of the outcome. In closing I will again say that I owe
you my sincere thanks for the inestimable good that Paine's celery com-
pound has done for me, and rest assured I will lose no opportunity of
recommending it to my friends and brother athlete^ R er ( HERBERT.
To the reader: You would be strong and well.
Paine's celery compound will enable you to be both. It will strengthen
the nerves purify the blood, revive the lost energyâ in a word, it win do
more to counteract the on-coming of ill-health, sickness, disease, than any
other medicine in the world. There can be no possible reason for not testing
the results in your own case. |
WHERE TRUSTS
CAN THRIVE
States That Have Very
Lax Laws.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, March 24.â Attorney
General Griggs' recent declaration that
the regulation of trusts and monopol
ies must be left to the various States
rather than to the national Congress,
has led the Herald to inquire what
anti-trust legislation is now on the
statute books of the States. The condi
tion of anti-trust legislation is given in
the dispatches herewith:
ALBANY, N. T., March 24.â There are
no effective anti-trust laws upon the
statute books of New York State.
NEW ORLEANS, March 24.â Louisiana
has an anti-trust law which prohibits the
formation of trusts or the entering into
of agreements by individual firms or cor
porations, in order to affect prices. In
order to prosecute a trust it is not neces
sary to identitfy all parties to the char
ters of incorporations violating this act,
which the law provides shall be revoked
and foreign corporations offending against
its provisions shall be prohibited from do
ing business in the State.
INDIANAPOLIS, March 24.â Indiana
has an anti-trust law, enacted in 1*97. It
applies only to corporations chartered un
der the laws of this State. The Attorney
General of the State says it cannot be
made effective.
ST. PAUL. Minn., March 24.âMinne
sota's anti-trust law provides that no
corporation, wherever organized, shall
create or enter into in this State any
pool or trust to regulate or fix price or
limit production of any commodity what
ever produced or sold in this State. The
penalty is a fine of from $100 to $1000 and
imprisonment for from one to ten years.
CINCINNATI, March 24.â Under an act
of the legislature passed April 18
any combination formed to restrict com
merce or prevent competition in manu
facturing is prohibited from doing busi
ness in Ohio. It is sufficient to prove that
a trust exists. It shall not be lawful for
any corporation or agent thereof to issue
trust certificates or enter an agreement
to limit the price of any article of com
merce. Each person associated with a
trust shall forfeit $50 a day to the State.
DETROIT, March 24.â Michigan has a
statute which prohibits the formation of
combinations, agreements or understand
ings designed to enhance, control or regu
late the market price of any commodity.

sachusetts laws. There is nothing to
prevent Massachusetts corporations from
uniting with trusts formed in other

JAMES M. BROWN
CALLED BY DEATH
SACRAMENTO, March 24.â James M.

this morning after an illness beginning
Saturday last. He had come up from San
Francisco to be at the session of the Leg
islature and had Intended to return to
the city as soon as the session adjourned.
On Saturday night he was stricken with
apoplexy and for some time his life was
despaired of. He rallied, but it was only
for a little while.
Brown was a. native of Lynn, Mass..
where his two sons and his widow now re
si' I.'1 .' Fifteen years ago he came to Pla
cerville and during all of his stay there
he was interested in mining ventures,
sometimes on his own account and some
times as the representative of others. Ha

Linden mine and then of the Kumfa mine,
but when about a year ago these prop
erties were leased he went to San Fran
cisco, where he lived until his fatal trip
to Sacramento. He has seen all the qpa

In the fifth round Choynski was cer

from a volley of left-handers, which dec

blow that many a McCoy man longed for
never came. The "Kid" hacked away and

when the gong sounded the end of the

The sixth round was also a bad one for
Joe. McCoy started the game by fiddling

out would go the left as straight as
a gun barrel and back would fly the head
of the man whose nose had stopped the
flight of the merciless glove.
Poor Joe was distressed. He could not
get away from that unerring left which
bothered his nose so badly. But McCoy
was not putting full steam into his blows
and time and again his friends yelled at
him to send one home; but the "Kid
evidently saw that the game was within
his reach and he remained satisfied that
constant jabbing would finally land him
a victor, and as previously stated he kept
his heavy fire under cover all through the
mill, making but two attempts to plant
his right on the Jaw during the twenty
rounds that were fought. One of the

haunches and the other hit the Califor

Tommy Ryan, in a letter to the sport

referee, was Introduced as "the famous â 
sporting man of New York."
"Gentlemen, please stop smoking," re"
quested Announcer Jordan, "and let us ]
have a little fresh air."
"Turn on the lights," returned the '
crowd in unison.
The men consumed five minutes in ad
justing their gloves and otherwise pre- :
paring for the fray. When they stripped ']
It was apparent that Choynski was much '
the larger of the two, and this was the
first time he had ever met a man smaller '
than himself.
McCoy wore a white pair of runner's
trousers and an American flag for a belt.
Choynski wore black trunks, with a white ;
belt.
Jordan stated that the men had agreed
to fight "fair and square." that is. they .
must not hit in the clinches, if holding on ;
with one hand; that if both hands were
free they could hit as much as they
pleased. At 10:05 the gong sounded for

opening which Joe did not take advantage
of. McCoy tried a straight left and fell

In the second round McCoy came up
shifting his trousers like a sailor. He

swung a vicious left, which landed hard
on the Kid's bead and threw him almost
off his feet. McCoy did not like it and
was more cautious thereafter. He took j
h ; * time jabbing his left at will into the
mouth and clinched to avoid a vicious
right :-wing which Joe aimed at the
head. McCoy followed Choynski around l
I the ring, occasionally planting his left on i

! which was rather tame, and fought
strongly in the eighth. He jabbed Mc-

for the head. McCoy g"t mad and threw

In Euc.ces.slon without a return. Choynski
went to the floor In the tenth round from
a left swir.K on the law. which knocked
him completely off his feet. He jumped
up quickly and what looked like a knock
out had apparently done him little In- j
Jury.
The tenth and eleventh rounds, barring
the knockdown, were particularly tarn"
afl far as damaging blows were concern- |
c-d. There was some lively fiddling, care
ful sparring an d pretty footwork, but no I
â 'arnage done. McCoy could jab Joe in :
the mouth with his left whenever he
chose, but it seemed as If he refrained
from the blow out of pure pity. Joe's |
nose and lips were all puffed and swollen
I c was bleeding considerably, while
the "Kid" had not a mark upon him.
In the seventeenth round McCoy again :
knocked his opponent down with a left
swing on the head, but Joe came up
quickly and sparred back at him as spry
as a cricket. McCoy's nose showed a |
little blood In the nineteenth from a left 'â 
jab that Joe got in on him. The "Kid"
was still taking his time, however, and.
fearing a possible knockout punch, did j
not take a chance.
The men indulged in the customary
handshake at the opening of the twen
tieth and last round. McCoy followed up
the shake by a jab in the face. Choynski I
swung his left for the head, which the i
Kid cleverly blocked and countered hi.s â 
right on the rit.s. McCoy rushed Joe [
- the ring, smashing him quickly in
the jaw twice with straight lefts. They
appeared hard enough to have felled him.
but Joe only stapgf-red and fought back
Into a clinch. McCoy rushed him to the
ropes again and there wan an even ex
change of lefts and rights on the body.
Choynski clinched the Kid around the
npcli with both hands, and McCoy smash
ed his right hard into the rihs. Many in I
the crowd yelled "foul." grasping at a
la^t chance to save the money they had
: bet on Choynskl, for it was apparent the
! bout would last the limit and that Mc
; Coy had had the best of it and would gain
the decision. The foul was not apparent
and the men fought on to the close.
As the gong sounded the end of the
fight Announcer "Billy" Jordan climbed
through the rrtpes. and the referee walk
ing over to him said. "McCoy." "McCoy
wins." repeated Jordan to the audience.
The decision of the referee- was greeted
with a storm of cheering, interspersed
with yells for McCoy and almost as many
for Choynski, whom the crowd seemed to
have ;i warm feeling for on account of
the game fight he had put up against his
I wily and hard-hitting opponent.
As early as 7 o'clock the doors of the
Pavilion were thrown open to receive the
eager throng. Before two hours had
elapsed fully five thousand people had
entered the big structure. The scenes that
wore witnessed at the Jeffreys-Sharkey
battle, held under the auspices of the
; same club, were missing. There was no
i disorder, breaking down of seats or quar
[ r*-ls over the right of possession to re
served peats. T'shers In large numbers
'â  Intelligently pointed out the seats held by
ticket-holders, and a large body of police
under the direction of Lieutenant Blrdsall
:of the Central station kept excellent
order.
In the vast throng could be seen a great
many of the city's professional and busi
ness men. Here arid there a number of
women, arrayed In gaudy headdress,
could be'dlscerned. and the gallery had a
lot of good-natured chaff at their expense.
The gallery gods came early and brought
their voices with them, and the arrival
of a noted personage brought forth yells
of appropal or derision.
A large advertisement that Informed
people where to pawn their chattels
cheaply was torn down because, per
chance, it obstructed their view of the
ring. Again, the dim light in the Pavil
ion aroused their Ire and their cries for
more light were numerous and were not
stopped until they gained their rights.
Here and there could be seen men ar
rayed In dress suits, opera hats, patent
leather shoes and immaculate shirt bos
oms and ties. A few made efforts to hide
their costume but failed, and came in for
a lot of joshing from thÂ£ir friends who
desired to know whether they had told
their wives they were going to the opera.
Preliminary to the event of the evening
six young and ambitious "pugs" amused
the waiting crowd with their fove-tap
plng. Cries of "take them away" and
other uncomplimentary remarks decided

eree and politician, to cut their efforts '
short.
A long wait then ensued, and the Im
patient crowd showed its displeasure by
stamping and howling lor the belated
fighters. It was learned that McCcy was I
unwilling to enter the ring until a stipu
lated amount was placed in the hands of
the referee. Messrs, Groom and (Jiobs de- '
clined to obey his demand at first, as it
was a direct slap at their honor as prize
fight promoters-. As the public was cry- i
ing for its moneys worth they acceded
to the Eastern fighter's request. McCoy
was Informed of the number of people in |
the house and the sum of $35' K) was placed |
in the hands of Harry Corbett as a guar- I
antee that the "Kid" would not be I
cheated.
The men then left their dressing rooms !
and as they marched through the big
crowd were cheered incessantly. The I
electric lights that could barely be seen
through the darkness sputtered and at j
last threw a faint light on the ring and
Its occupants. The gallery cheered, the i
bell rang and the men began sparring for i
money and honor.
Says Choynski
Is Hard Game
After the battle McCoy and his train
ers. Jack Stelzner and Frank Purcpll and
Homer Selby, could scarcely make their j
way down the crowded aisle that led to \
their dressing room. The "Kid's" hands
were kept busy shaking with everybody
who crowded about him. Once in the.
dressing room, the door was locked and
only intimate friends were allowed to. en
ter.
The "Kid" stripped and Stelzner and
Purcell rubbed him down very thorough
ly with alcohol and witchhazel. There
were hardly any evidences on the "Kid's"
body to show that he had been in a
twenty-round contest. His right eye 'â 
worp a speck of black and the skin was
slightly chafed under the eyelid of the
other. There were no marks on his body.
While being rubbed down. McCoy said:
"Choynski is a strong, clever fellow and
an exceptionally hard man to knock out. <
During the twenty rounds I landed on
him several times hard enough to put an
ordinary man out of business. I know
after the first round that I could beat
him at any stage. He was making a good
defensive fight, but he never seemed able
to land on me effectively. I was not
dazed or even distressed by any blow he
landed on me during the entire contest.
"Why didn't I go in and finish nlm?
Well. I thought up to the last minute I
would get him coming to me and end the
battle. I was on the aggressive at all
times, but I never allowed myself to for
get the opportunity of knocking a man
out when ne's coming your way. Then
again. I was not as strong aa I wouid
like to have been. I honestly believe
that had I gone into the ring oft the reel
without wasting so much energy train
ing I would have had more strength. Of
course, I was not in any danger from
weakness. I simply felt that if I were
stronger I could have forced my hand
much oftener than I did.
"Choynski 19 in my opinion as good a
man to-day ac ever he was. Now I don't
say this because I have defeated him. I
don't know how his fighting looked to the
spectators, but I was in a better position
to Judge him than anybody. He has a
might of power behind that left hand and
he is not slow In shooting it over. He
tried to get me with his right several
times and one time I just got my jaw cov
ered In time.
"After the first round I felt that I would
win, and win easy. I felt certain that he
couldn't hit me very often and I knew I
jab him at will. Cnoyoski claimed
foul several times. I never hit him low,
nor tiM I come anywhere near his belt.
The last time he claimed foul 1 sent in a
left jab in the pit of the stomach. I am
certain that it was not a foul because I
took particular pains to aim high. When
the blow landed my eyes followed it, so
thpre was absolutely no chance of it be
ing too low.
"I am particularly pleased with the gen
eral attitude "f the spectators toward me.
They were fair In their Judgment and I
am "phased at the cordial reception they
gave mo.
â I am now ready to meet Mr. Sharkey
tf that K-ntleman will give me another
chance."
Choynski Pleased
With His Showing
Choynski appeared happy even in de
feat. Despite the fart that hi? lips were
* swollen, his eyes puffed and discolored.
\h* Callfornian seemed satisfied that he
had gone the route and proved to his
friends that although he was a "has
been" he was in the ring all the time.
In fact. Joe was unmindful of the ludi
crous appearance of his countenance. He
grimaced at his friend? and joshed them
as if they were the sufferers, and laugh
ingly asked them if he didn't look hand
l some. When asked to say something for
I publication. Joe hummed that tuneful bal
lad "He Has Seen Better Days." and
gloried in the fact that he was a pretty
I good old back number.
"I am a loser," he said. "Had I won I
would have said I was the best fellow in
the ring. I thought I had a chance at
every stage of the fight, otherwise I
would not have stayed in the ring. Mc-
Coy hits hard enough to hurt anybody,
but he did not hurt me. The blows he
gave me In the groin bothered me
throughout. When I told the people that
'â  Bharkey hit me there they said I was
I 'kidding' and to-night they seemed to

that the > Kid' did land there two or three
times, and it gave me greater pain than

tinued "that didn't bother me at all. did
it?" he jokingly queried. He then worked
his hand up and down and showed its
bad condition. "Why, that reminds me
of what I once heard in Australia," he
added "One fighter who lost said to his
second: 'Me bloomin' 'and is all right;
It ain't hurt, Jackey.' And Jackey re
plied: 'Of course not, you bloody duffer;
you never used it.' And that's my case
exactly." laughingly replied Choynski.
The Californian has made no plans for
the future. He said he did not know
whether he would enter the ring again or
not. "I guess lam a good old has been."
he concluded, and then left with his
i friend, Eddie Graney.
I Graney Wants Joe
to Quit Fighting
Eddie Graney, sportsman, politician and
jCnoynski's best friend, wants Joe to quit
the fighting game for good and if his
counsel prevails the public will see Joe
no more in the ring. After the fight last
night Graney said:
"I only wish Joe would get out of the
business. He has been going up against
the best and to-day he is nothing more
than a cripple. For fourteen or fifteen
years he has battled manfully, and now
adays, when he meets a youngster, he
shows his age. Why, when he was as
young as McCoy he could put them all
AT DUTY'S CALL HE
FOREGOES HONORS
DR. E. L. PERRAULT Resigns a High
Civic Office to Devote Himself to His
Profession.
DR. EDWARD T-. PERRAI'LT placed his resignation as chairman of the
Finance Committee of the Board of Supervisors in the hands of Clerk
John A. Russell of the- board yesterday. It will be acted upon at the
weekly meeting next Monday. Dr. Perrault assigns as his reason for giv
ing up this most important chairmanship of the board the fact of added
business cares in his profession.
His father has purchased Paraiso Springs, to which he will devote his at
tention. aii'J his practice In this city will thus devolve upon his s-on. who is as
sociated with him in business. The retiring official has nothing but words of
praise for his associates on the committee. He scouts the idea that he gives
up the responsible office because of any lack of harmony between himself
and his associates. His expressions are reiterated by the other members of the
board, who speak in the kindliest manner of him and of his devotion to the
interests of the people.
Speculation is already rife as to who will succeed him. John Lackmann
Is Dr. Perrault's choice, but other members of the board do not regard his
candidacy seriously. Supervisor Holland says the board is entirely satisfied
with Dr. Perrault in his present position and will refuse to accept his resig
nation. He says the doctor has proved a success in the position and should
retain it; that he enlivened the proceedings of the board and stirred the
members up occasionally, but it waa all taken in a good-natured manner.
Dr. Perrault"s resignation is imperative, hence the election of a successor is
a necessity. It is thought the choice of the members will be Supervisor Aigel
tingor. He said yesterday he would not make a fight for the place, but would
accept if he was the choice of his associates.
out. Joe was in condition to-night, oth
erwise he would never have gone the dis
tance. I did not send him after McCoy in
the last four rounds of the fight because
I did not want Joe to take a chance or
getting knocked out before all his friends.
"1 only hope Joe will quit the game and
if he does I will never look at a prize
fitrhtrr again. If he decides to stay in the
business I will be his friend, but if mjj
talk will move him he will quit for good.
Referee Kennedy
Extols McCoy
After ordering Billy Jordan to announce
to the expectant thousands his decision
in McCoy's favor Referee J. C. Kennedy,
the Eastern sporting man. calmly left thÂ»
ring, feeling satisfied in his own mind
that he had Judged the fipht wisely. The
fact that experts and fair-minded men
concurred in hir decision pleased tha
rotund referee, and h^ smiled broadly on,
all who congratulated him on the stand
he had taken.
Mr. Kennedy declared that McCoy won
the. fight on points, and that although
Choynski was a good man he was out
classed by the "Kid"" in every round. Ha
spoke highly of McCoy's cleverness, and
s;iid it was one of the best battles he had
ever participated in.
Green Willing
To Meet McCoy
George Green, the champion welter
weisrht of the roast, who will soon meet
"Mysterious" Billy Smith, sat close to
the ring last night and carefully studied
McCoy's movements. Green declared
that the "Kid" was one of the cleverest
exponents of the manly art in the ring
to-day, and also stated that he was will
ing to meet McCoy one week after his
battle with Smith." under the conditions
named by the Easterner. The conditions
are that McCoy la to put him nut in ten
rounds. Despite the fact that McCoy is
a hard hitter and a shifty man with his
mitts. Green thinks thar hr- can not ful
fill the contract. H.^ Is anxious to try
conclusions with McCoy, and it is prob
able that he will be given an opportunity.
A battle between these clever men
would attract a^ large a crowd as the
fight last night, as Green is known to be
both clever and a hard hitter.
SUPERVISORS SLIGHTED.
Complain of an Unequal Division
of Tickets Among Them for
the Bout.
The Health and Police Committee of
the Supervisors passed upon three appli
cations for boxing permits yesterday. The
request of the National Athletic Club for
official sanction of a meeting between
"Billy" Smith and George Green early in
April -will he reported upon favorably to
the board. The applications of the Ex
celsior Club for a permit for a bout be
tween professionals and of the Metropole
Amateur Athletic flub for an amateur
meeting were denied.
From the temper of some of the Super
visors at the board rooms yesterday
therp is a possibility of the old war over
permits being renewed. Favors have not
been dispensed with an even hand, hence
the mutterings of discontent. Supervis
ors Byington and Deasy were allowed but
three tickets for the meeting between
â¢ 'hoynski and McCoy, while the other
mfnibere of the board were allowed not
;â¢â¢.-.< than five, and in sime instances more.
When the recommendation of the Health
and Police Committee is presented to the
hoard on Monday a detf rmined effort will
be made to prevent its adoption.
The Supervisors want a larger number
of tickets for a cheaper portion of the
hruse than the boxes at the ringside. As
Manager Kennedy of the Excelsior Club
h-is been generous with his ttcKfts. It is
expected he will be favored hereafter
when his aplication for a permit is. be
fore the board.

THE NEED OF VIGILANCE.
THE Legislature stood its ground well against
Burns, and the majority had its way in protect
the reputation of the party and the State.
When the members were all together and the eye oi
the :â  upon them the light of publicity was a
material element in the strength of their purpose.
There have been some outgivings since the adjourn
ment which indicate the purpose of Burns to continue
his campaign of persuasion, using the better oppor
tunity of the seclusion in which it may be carried on.
If it succeed, an extra session, made necessary by
some collateral emergency, may be used to effect his
election by a coup. We hope that the constituents of
members in every district will see this danger
and meet it by opposing their wishes, preferences and
views of party duty to the urgency of this man's am
bition.
In the Republican party, in every district, are men
ifluence, who command the attention and respect
Such men should make themselves felt
and should be watchful and instant in the matter. A
few papers in the State have fallen into indirect lamen
n over Burns' defeat by an outcry over the failure
tor. They arc urging Burns upon pub
lic attention by an officious admission that leaving the
torial seat vacant means the defeat of the party
next year, and of course there follows the implication
that to : with Burns means party success.
We are well assured that no man who writes such
matter believes it to be true. Where in the history of
American politics can they show an instance in which
a party has lost an ensuing election as the result of
leaving a seat in the Senate vacant rather than fill it
with an unfit and unworthy man? There is no such
in ,:nce. A politic?.! party has always gained strength
and won victories by standing to its best ideals. It
was so in Oregon, and will be so always when and
where the party stands by those principles and prac
tices which commend it to the best element in the
community. Go. upon the streets and highways and
any place where men meet and make diligent inquiry
for Republicans who will vote the Democratic ticket
because Burns was beaten, and also for those who
would refuse to vote the Republican ticket had he
been elected. When the tallies are made compare
them and see the enormous preponderance of men
who would refuse to fight Republican battles when a
victory won is debauched to such purposes as the
.election of Burns to the Senate.
California" has not a great majority, a decided and
permanent partisan preference, either way. Elections
â¢here are determined by a large and increasing inde
pendent vote, which holds the balance of power. In
1896 and 180S this independent vote was cast for the
. Republican ticket, which represented in its personnel
and policy what seemed to these voters the be?t for
the public good. Let any one go among these inde
' pendent voters who number tens of thousands, and
tally the number he finds indisposed to further aid the
Republican party because Burns was beaten, and also
0 who feel their confidence well placed in the
pr.rty that refused to elect him. These independents
â will be found practically unanimous in their approval
of his defeat.
It is noteworthy that the influence of the Examiner
is being used by Burns to control Republican senti
ment. That paper was in his camp throughout the
struggle at Sacramento. The only way in which it
â¢tan further aid him is by brag and bluster, to the
effect that failure to elect a Senator gives the State to
the Democracy next year. This is being used upon
â¢.unthinking Republicans, and is the principal capital
of the few Republican papers which covertly support
Burns. We ask these Republicans and these papers
if they really think the Examiner believes the election
of Burns would make the State safely Republican
next year? Of course it believes no such thing. It
knows that the Legislature did the wisest thing in its
power to do. and therefore it seeks by indirection to
have this wise thing undone.
Let Republicans be vigilant, let them support the
action and the purpose of the majority of their legis
lators, and thereby hold their party together and com-
mand the further confidence of the independent vote
of the State.
Since Sampson has the approval of the President, it
'is possible the aspersions of critics who have no more
influence than a yellow journalist out of a job can be
endured.
Unfortunately there is no way of determining just
what proportion of the soldiers who died of disease
acquired their fatal malady from rotten beef.

used with the Legislature and see what effect it will

praying for rain can be overdone.
A WORD TO MR. HUNTINGTON.
\A R. C. P. HUNTINGTON is about to pay his
\ / \ annual visit to this State, and it is sincerely to
â¢ *be hoped that his presence may aid in a last
. i ing settlement of the difficulties between the railroad
! and the public, much embittered by the late deadlock
in the legislative joint convention. When the Repub
lican State Convention of last year was held and dur
ing the canvass that followed it was believed by con
servative men that no such opportunity had occurred
in many years for the obliteration of old animosities
and the restoration of amicable relations with the rail
road corporations. Congress had ended the con
troversy over the debt due to the Government from
the Central Pacific Railroad Company, and there was
no other practical issue open to interfere with the i
intelligent , co-operation of the railroad and the peo- |
pie that the interests of this coast and of the nation J
demanded, and especially in view of the approaching ;
transfer of the scepter of commerce from the Atlantic
to the Pacific. In 1896 the Chicago platform had in
troduced a species of demagogism that the solid
citizens of the country successfully resented. In 1898,
with platforms that attacked the most vital principles
in our American institutions, the fusion candidates j
and their organs concentrated upon loud and unmean
ing clamor against the railroad. The opportunity thus
furnished was promptly seized. The local railroad
authorities distinctly announced their complete and
final withdrawal from politics. The announcement |
did not mean that any class of citizens should be im-
I peded in their political action, but it did mean and
was accepted as meaning that the railroad had ceased
its efforts to dominate municipal and State govern
ment, and, for its own protection, would rely upon
its conceded equality before the law.
It was on these lines that the Republican victory in
California was achieved. But, without any reasonable
cause and with an actual proclamation of treachery,
the candidacy of Dan Burns was inaugurated and the
most disgraceful struggle that has ever been witnessed
in America prolonged until it ended in the loss of a
Federal Senator to the State, but in thÂ« triumph of
the Republican party.
Why the railroad wanted Dan Burns unless to dis
play its absolute authority and to disrupt the Repub
lican organization it is difficult to conceive. While
Mr. Huntington and its other chief owners and its
officers are together it is not only proper but essen
tial that they examine the situation and define their
future intentions. Our people and the solid press of
the State have never indorsed fanatical and personal
attacks upon railroad proprietors and upon railroad
interests. They have scarcely been amused by the
coarse brutalities and insulting caricatures through
which the Examiner has simulated an independence
it did not actually possess and curried favor among
the lower strata of population. Mr. Huntington, it
must be admitted, is one of the ablest men in the
country, identified with practical business for almost
sixty years. There is no inclination to disparage him
personally among men who represent intelligence and
weighty public opinion. There is no sentiment any
where able to control an election that is in favor of
cinching the railroad or depriving it of one jot or
tittle of its rights or of confiscating its property to the
amount of a dollar or of inflicting any injury upon its
owners, its officers or its employes.
There is, however, a stern determination that will
absolutely prevail, as it has already prevailed in the
Senatorial contest, that the railroad shall be con
tented with fair treatment and with equality before the
law, and that it shall not substitute itself for the gov
ernment and dictate official selection and executive,
legislative and judicial action. It is this determina
tion, expressive of all upon which The Call and other
independent papers, with the community behind them,
have insisted, that, upon reflection and upon a wise
calculation of chances, the gentlemen who control the
railroad may deem it wise to respect. The pledge of
non-intervention in the last campaign ought to have
been unnecessary, but it was demanded and it was
made, in a form and with a solemnity that bound the
railroad. The pledge was undoubtedly broken and a
conflict initiated that has hurt the State, while the in
jury was reduced to the minimum through the integ
rity of the majority of Republican legislators. Where
the individual responsibility for this treachery is to
be fastened we do not attempt to determine. It
mu?t rest somewhere. It now attaches to the railroad
itself, through its political managers. Whether it has
the indorsement of Mr. Huntington and of other pro
prietors of railroad interests it is for them to settle,
and the sooner the better. There are a few facts that
cannot be disputed. The Republican party will not
be run by the railroad. It will reject the bad in
fluences that clustered about Dan Burns. It will in
sist upon entering the important campaign of 1900
without manacles on its hands or fetters on its i
ankles. It will represent the State and the nation
with all the responsibility and dignity that such a
representation implies, and its leaders will be the
acf.ial products of the times and not the indecent pro
trusions from corrupt and low politic?.
These railroad gentlemen should remember a few his
torical facts and should also realize present conditions.
They owe much to the nation, but more to the State.
Let them look back to iÃ6r and examine the account
between themselves and the public. Their tremen
dous accumulations, of which only the anarchists or
the unphilosophical socialists would deprive them,
have been principally derived from the sweat and the
toil of the masses. Half a million dollars probably
represented the combined resources of the original
corporators of the Central Pacific. The nation, the
State, municipalities, contributed to the original suc
cess of the enterprise. The people have been contrib
uting ever since. Consider what the Central Pacific,
outside of some land grants of comparative insignifi
cance, has produced. It has built all the tributary
railroads that perfect the State system. It has con
structed and equipped the Southern Pacific Railroad
and the Oregon Railroad. It has produced the Stan
ford University, with all its endowments, the edifices
on Nob Hill, the works at Newport News. It has
paid for coal mines, for hotels, for enterprises asso
ciated with the railroad business that could not be
enumerated. It has built up enormous private for- j
tunes existing in real and personal property, not only
in California, but in other parts of the republic.
These gentlemen of the railroad owe to the State at
least decent treatment. They owe much to the Re
publican party â far too much to justify them in per
mitting their influence, their power and their wealth
to be used for its local disintegration under Demo
cratic manipulation. The founders of their railroad
interests were all Republicans to a man. It was un
der Republican administrations that their land grants
were secured and their credit guaranteed. For many
years their chief legal advisers, such men as Edward
B. Crocker, Silas W. Sanderson and Creed Haymond,
were Republicans, and under their administrations
tho law department and the political department re
mained distinct. It has only been recently that the
functions of law and of politics have been united in
a Democrat, who was the first to announce and the
j last to surrender the candidacy of Daniel M. Burns.
I The story of tlhe past year is the fruit of this unnatural â 
j conjunction of discordant elements, one of which is
lan impure excrescence upon railroad management,
THE SAX FBAKCTSCO CALL, SATURDAY. 3IABCH 25, 1899,
and it will be recited hereafter as a phenomenal at
tempt to disrupt a party and to degrade a common
wealth.
We invite the railroad gentlemen to avail them
selves of the coming opportunity, with Mr. Hunting
ton in their midst, to bring their united intelligence
to bear upon the political situation and to determine
whether it is worth their while to resume or continue
the lapsed controversy of the closed legislative ses
sion. The Call, speaking for itself and as it believes
for the Republicans of the State, will aim to extend
to them all legitimate protection and to maintain with
them proper and honorable relations that tend to pro
mote industry, commerce, trade, manufacture, the
vital and extending forces of American enterprise and
of American civilization, but it will also stand for the
Republican party, its principles and its pledges,
in the spirit as well as in the letter, and
it will resent and antagonize to the last extremity
every attempt to reverse its history, to pollute its ma
chinery, to prostitute its objects, to lower its influence
and to disgrace its name. The time has come when
railroad corporations must attend to railroad business
and leave government, in all its departments, to the
exclusive control of intelligent, educated, honest and
patriotic citizens.
SIDE ISSUES OF THE BEEF SCANDfJL.
DISCLOSURES made concerning the nature of
the meat supplied to the army have been more
distressing to Chicago than to any other city
in the nation. The Chicago citizens feel as hurt at
heart over the outrage done to the soldiers as do any
other class of people, but they feel also hurt in their
pocketbooks, and consequently while the country at
large is moved by a straight-out indignation, Chicago
is the victim of what is known as conflicting emo
tions. She would like to hang the corrupt contract
ors and then take the officials who have exposed the
wrong and club them to death.
In default of having anything to say defensive of
the unpardonable iniquity of canning rotten beef
Chicago takes up the minor issue of false labeling,
and while admitting that it is not Christian or Wash
ingtonian to print a lie on a label and sell boiled soup
meat under the name of canned roast beef, she as
serts that she is not the only offender on the market.
There are others.
According to the Chicago men not only do traders
in the country generally give a good name to bad
stuff, but even in Boston and Philadelphia, the two
centers of self-asserted righteousness, there are im
portant industries carried on under titles as bogus as
those which half the so-called foreign noblemen bear
when they swagger across the summer resorts where
the daughters of American millionaires spend their
holidays and the paternal coin.
The Philadelphians, it is said, do a thrifty trade in
buying up plums in the Middle West, where they are
cheap, and after carting them to the city of brotherly
love pack them in neat boxes and label them Califor
nia prunes. The Boston trick is neater. They catch
small fry herring, in the early days of their artless
lives, before they are half grown, and, after putting
them into attractive cans, sell them to epicures under
the very appetizing name of brook trout.
Such practices as these do not in any way offset
the atrocious crime of the Chicago beef-packers,
whose output was not only falsely labeled, but has
been shown to be in many instances positively dan
gerous to health. Nevertheless, all false labeling is
reprehensible and the cases cited arc worth noting.
They furnish new illustrations of the need of a law
requiring all articles to be correctly labeled as to the
nature of their contents and the place of production.
It is an insult to the mountain trout to bestow '
aristocratic name upon callow offspring of the com
mon seas, while to call an acid Nebraska plum by the
honored name of so luscious a food as the California
prune is something like blasphemy. Each is a down
right imposition upon- the appetite and the credu
lity, the purse and the stomach of the great body of
the American people. Bad as they are, however,
they are not the worst of such offenses, and it is high
time for the enactment of legislation to prevent them.
HONESTY IN THE CONCRETE.
AN impulsive gentleman once said that all men
were liars, but upon reflection he took it back.
He was of such prominence that his views be
came of record. Many others have declared in an
unofficial way that every man has his price, but these
also have erred, without the grace to acknowledge it.
Recently a sum of money amounting almost to
$10,000 was picked up in the streets of this city. To
the man who found it this represented a fortune. To
the man who had lost it the losing had been sudden
reduction to penury. The finder could easily have re
tained it, and if a person of ordinary discretion have
kept the fact concealed. However, he did nothing
of the kind. As soon as he saw an advertisement an
nouncing the ownership he sought out the owner and
restored the property, refusing even to accept a re
ward.
Of course he did nothing but his duty, yet to de
cline a reasonable reward will be reckoned an over
nicety of sentiment. It would not have been pay for
being honest, for no man with an impulse to be hon
est would expect this. It would have been more in
the nature of a commission. With full power to ruin
another for selfish motives, and yet refraining from
doing so, the finder could have viewed the transaction
as somewhat analogous to that between a broker and
his principal. Circumstances had constituted him cus
todian of funds, and for handling them to the best ad
vantage of the principal he was surely entitled to
recompense, putting the affair on a business basis.
People who save abandoned ships do not do so on
a charity plan, yet the courts do not hesitate to up
hold claims which to the layman seem grossly ex
orbitant.
However, it is refreshing to observe a demonstra
tion that there are men as honest in practice as in
theory. Such a man is Mr. Thomas, and as to the
taking of a reward, that is his personal concern.
Despite the fact that one Gilligan was observed to
cut the throat of another man, who thereupon died, a
Coroner's jury has brought in a verdict of death from
a "wound inflicted by a person unknown." The in
telligent jurors should have secured an introduction
to Gilligan.
The Colma officer who deliberately killed an inno
cent boy says now that he is sorry. The prospects that
he will be far sorrier before circumstance stifles his
power of expressing emotion are also cheering.
Editor Reid says that China is waking up from a
sleep of a thousand years, and it might be added that
if China is possessed of keen perception she will be
sorry not to have remained dreaming.
Alger wants it distinctly understood that he is re
sponsible for the conduct of the War Department, but
whether this feeling antedates the era of embalmed
bovine has not been announced.
Another Ingleside victim has had a view of the in
terior of a jail, an experience the baiters of the trap
have miraculously escaped.

SAVED FROM RUIN.
While all Republicans will undeniably

elect a Senator, yet for one the Herald

WE ARE BETTER OFF.
Colonel Dan M. Burns is not a success
as a political prophet when forecasting
for himself. He was not elected l United

WAS WELL, DONE.
We believe the great majority of our
people will say that the Republican
opponents of Burns did well in Prevent-
Ing an opportunity for that individual
or his tools to buy impecunious legisla
tors. The experience of Barnes with
Steinman shows to what depths of in

REPUBLICAN VOTERS SAVED.
Hence, we say that the outcome of
the last fiasco, if we may call it such,
is not an entire defeat. The fact that
there has been no election is enough to
prove that with all the glaring attempts
at buying men, as disclosed in the
Green investigation, and the subse
quent action of the Burns push to pro
cure the withdrawal of Barnes, the peo
ple yes, even the Republican voters of
the State of California, are saved by
the result as announced, from tne
humiliation of having any man of a
character they do n^ approve to rep
resent them in the highest body of
legislation in this Union. Thus the re
sult, while it is humiliating to those
who honestly fought for a new Senator
to help sustain the present administra
tion <s not wholly a defeat, for there
are some things that are won when lost.
Hanford Sentinel.
BOODLE IS DOOMED.
The failure of the Legislature to elect
a successor to Senator White will serve
to crystallize sentiment in this State in
favor of election by the popular vote.
It is likely that before long the pres
sure upon Congress to submit a con
stitutional amendment will prove Irre
sistible. There will be less opposition
to It in the East than in the West, for
the reason that in most of the older
commonwealths the selection of an un
popular man to the Senate is a diffi
cult task. Legislatures in those States
scarcely ever dare to run contrary to
prevailing public sentiment. Members
do so at the peril of their political fu
ture. Men who are really fully equipped
for the duties of Senator will as a rule
suffer little from the submission of their
cause to the electors. Those who are
unfitted for the post, and who depend
upon their purses for recognition, will
continue to oppose any change in the
present methods, but it is by no means
certain that boodle will always prevail.

SUCH IS HIS ALLEGATION
FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS
NECESSARY.
The Petitioner Says That the Corpor
ation Is Only Entitled to Inter

Investment.
W. J. Fifield, through his attorney,
Benjamin Morgan, will endeavor to com
pel the Board of Supervisors to make
further investigation into the affairs of
i the Spring Valley Water Works and again
fix the water rates. Yesterday afternoon
Fifield, "on his own behalf and that of
the water-rate payers of the city and
county," applied for a writ of mandate
directed against the Board of Supervisors
to compel them to investigate and deter
mine the actual value of the plant of the
Spring Valey Water Works, to be used in
supplying the inhabitants of this city
with water for the fiscal year beginning
July 1, 1599, and ending June 30, 1900. It
is averred by the petitioner that in pur
| suance of the constitution the Board of
I Supervisors "pretended" to fix the water
I rates. â  'â ..
"January 9, 1899," reads the petition,
"the board met and passed a resolution

That the first performance of "Carmpn"
madp a genuine stir amonp the opera
pners waa evidenced last night by the
crowded house that greeted its repetition.
The seats were all occupied and there was
a liberal fringe of slanders on every floor.
De I-ussan's embodiment of the title roleâ
in fart, the entire productionâ will long
be remembered in San Francisco. "Car
men" has been one of the greatest suc
cesses of tf\e season, ranking second only
to "La Boheme." De Lussan repeated her
triumph of last week, and Gadski again
did beautiful, unostentatious work in the
part of Micaela. Bonnard's Don Jose was
even better than before. He found his
voice earlier In the performance, and both
vocally and histrionically was he splen
didly vivid in the part. Bensaude, who
â¢has had a bit too much to do, singing
nearly every night, was weaker than be
fore In the Toreador. His fatigue was
obvious. The cast was the same as that
of the former presentation, which was
fully reviewed in an earlier Issue.

'"PHE pleasant method and beneficial effects of the well-known remedy, Syrup op Figs, manufactured
â¢*â  by the California Fig Syrup Company, illustrate the value of obtaining the liquid laxative principles
j of plants known to be medicinally laxative and presenting them in the form most refreshing to the taste
and acceptable to the system. It is the one perfect strengthening laxative,
CLEANSING THE SYSTEM EFFECTUALLY, DISPELLING
SCOLDS AND HEADACHES, PREVENTING FEVERS,
OVERCOMING HABITUAL CONSTIPATION PERMANENTLY.
Its perfect freedom from every objectionable quality and substance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, gently yet promptly, without weakening or irritating them, make it the ideal laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs are used, as they are pleasant to the taste, but
THE MEDICINAL QUALITIES ARE OBTAINED FROM SENNA AND OTHER AROMATIC PLANTS,
by a method known to the California Fig Syrup Company only. In order to get its beneficial effects, and
to avoid imitations, please remember the full name of the Company printed on the front of every package.
Consumers of the choicest products of modern commerce purchase at about the same price that others
pay for cheap and worthless imitations. To come into universal demand and to be everywhere considered
the best of its class, an article must be capable of satisfying the wants and tastes of the best informed
purchasers. The California Fig Syrup Company having met with the highest success in the manufacture
and sale of its excellent liquid laxative remedy, Syrup of Figs, it has become important to all to have a
knowledge of the Company and its product. The California Fig Syrup Company was organized more than
fifteen years ago, for the special purpose of manufacturing and selling a laxative remedy which would be
more pleasant to the taste and more beneficial in effect than any other known. The great value of the
remedy, as a medicinal agent and of the Company's efforts, is attested by the sale of millions of bottles .
annually, and by the high approval of most eminent physicians. As the true and genuine remedy named
Syrup of Figs is manufactured by the California Fig Syrup Company only, the knowledge of that fact
will assist in avoiding the worthless imitations manufactured by other parties.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW YORK STOCK MARKET.
NEW YORK. March 24â fact that money
was slightly easier to-day, rail rates ranging
. frrirt 4 to 4"-2 per cent, lent confidence to opera

of the day. Another Important Influence on j
quotations was the prediction that because of â 
the curtailment In loans supposed to have taken |
place this week the banks would be able to j
Bhow an increase in purples reserve to-morrow.
Fool buying of Brooklyn Rapid Transit, which
â¢ lifted It S. and People's Gas. which gained !
â  nearly a point, had a sentimental Influence ;
because of the prominence of the parties con- |

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK, March 24.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's I^ondon financial cablegram says:
The markets here were idle and firm to-day.
Americana hardened on the purchase of 5000
shares of Union Pacific, Northern Pacific and
Atchlson by Liverpool bears. New York sold,
causing a sharp relapse. There was a recov
ery in the street, with Denver preferred lead
ing. Tintos were 40%. on free selling against
options maturing on Monday. Anacondas were
8%. I understand from a good quarter that
the dividend will be unchanged. Bostons were

BRADSTREETS FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, March 24â Brad street's finan
cial review will say to-morrow: Although de
cidedly Irregular, the market this week was
generally strong. Its most remarkable feature
being the resistance which was offered to the
Influence of higher rates for money. As ex
plained elsewhere, the combination of season
able demands from the Interior for the April
settlements, with the temporary locking up of
some large amounts in connection with pend
ing industrial company deals, caused at the
beginning of the week a marked reduction
In the supply of call money and an advance in
the rates which Wall street had to pay for
accommodation on stock collateral, to 59* per
cent, some quotations as high as 5 to 10 per
cent being also recorded. There has never
been a time when the amount of securities in
the market held for speculative account and
carried In loans of this kind was so large.
The increasing portion of Industrial securities,
many of them new and of untested value,
also seemed to conservative people to consti
tute a danger and It is not strange that many
tenders refuse to accept such collateral and
that where loans are made upon It higher
rates and wider margins are demanded.
Stimulated as the bull market has been since
last autumn by the exceptionally large sup
plies of loanable funds and the easy rates, the
hardening of the money market was considered
likely to result in considerable speculative
liquidation. Last week had developed symp
toms of such a tendency, but to the surprise
of Wall street Itself, the further upward move
ment of rates for money at the beginning of
the present one produced no great Impression
on prices and failed to check the development
of bullish activity and manipulation In various
parts of the list. This may be attributed to
the general recognition of the fact that the
causes for the spurt In money rates were |
temporary, and that after April 1 it is prob
able a return flow of money from the Interior
will result in renewed ease. In fact, ther*
Is reason to believe that outside institutions
offered increased amounts in consequence of
the news that rates had advanced, and at any
rate, while time money was In increased re
quest by Wall street borrowers, there has been
a large and Increasing supply, and money on j
railroad collateral could be easily obtained at
4 per cent, while at higher rates borrowers
on industrial securities can secure accommo
dation in spite of the conservatism which is
expressed about the latter class of securities.
As the week progressed the release of money
which had been temporarily tied up by some
large industrial deals, with other causes, re
sulted In easier conditions as to rates ana
supplies and the relief to the money market
was reflected by renewed strength In prices.
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK. March 24.â Bradstreefs to
morrow will say: Stormy weather, retarding
spring distribution in some sections, has im
parted an Irregular appearance to general trade,
while some few reductions in prices of leading
staples, notably raw cotton and wool, copper
j and some few other metals, serve to break the
I otherwise almost unvarying . appearance of
i strength of staple values. The general com
! mercial situation, however, continues to pre
! sent much apparent strength and the few lines
i that note a quieter tone of business find ready
! substitutes among other branches which as
'â  yet have been rather backward. The see-caw
of wheat prices has been upward this week,
theoretically on reports of crop damage at home
and abroad, but largely owing to speculative
i overselling during last week depression,
! which, by the way, again developed some good
foreign buying. Better weather at the South,
! and especially improved roads, find reflection
i in a larger volume of cotton this week, and
' the result is a fractional shading of price*.
Coffee is slightly lower on the week on more
! or less active jobbing inquiry, while the h gh
. price of copper seems at last to be affecting
the demand, which Is slackening up, with a
â  consequent decrease in value of that metal,
sympathized in by declines in tin and lead
i Sugar reflects steady buying in practically
i unchanged quotations. Lumber is feeling the
stimulus of the approach of active building
' operations and white pine and spruce are higher
at nearly all markets, with hard woods sympa
'â  thizing and even outstripping this class of ma
terial and their upward movement. Indus
trially the situation Is satisfactory.
Wheat exports, including flour shipments, for
the week aggregate 3.746,761 bushels, against
4 114 046 last week, 3.896,318 in the corresponding
week, of 1898. 1.749.419 In 1887. 1 744.837 In 18%
! and 2.562.965 In 1886. Since July 1. this season,
the exports of wheat aggregate 180.972.662 bush
els against 176,516.888 last year.
Business failure* for the week number only
I*2 as against 205 last week, a drop of 23, and

DUN'S REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, March 24.â R. G. Dun & Co. 1 Â»
weekly review of trade will say to-morrow:
Business is not frightened, either by the great ,
capitalization of new companies or by the wild ,
fluctuations In Wall street. No matter how
much the stock operations in New York may
count, business elsewhere is large enough to
warrant a wonderful expansion of industries,
and that is the thing most important to ob
serve. In no considerable branch has produc
tion diminished, but in all practically It has
been Increasing during the past week.
In iron and steel a little lower price for
i Bessemer pig appears at Plttsburg. but with |
gray forge 7Sc higher there and Southern Iron
at Chicago 60c to $1 higher. There is no market
for billets, as no works East or West can fur
nish them at present, but quotations range m
price from $25 at Pittsburg to $27 at Phila
delphia. In finished products there Is ,the same
trouble. Rails can be bought at 123 (at Pitts
burg and $24 at Chicago, if at all. but small
lots have been sold at $26 at New York. Chi
cago Is taking many contracts for building in
Boston. New York and Washington, amount
ing to 4000 tons, but makers elsewhere are
overcrowded with work. No market can de
liver plates within any reasonable time and |
i Pittsburs works are sold to July on sheets, I
though Instead of $2 40 there. $2 65 at Chicago j
and $3 at Philadelphia was paid. Plate mills i
are all full and there Is heavy demand at
Chicago for bars, with one carmaker's contract
for 5000 tons, price* steadily growing stronger.
i The minor metals are all weak with the re
! action of London speculation, though coper
; has declined to 17c hero and is yet so much
above London that exports have been stopped
for the week. The February outbreak, both
here and in other countries, was greater than
last year's monthly average, although Febru
ary is a short month.
Wool Is at the doubting point, with large
pales ordered from the Interior by tirerl holders
and some concessions made to secure trans
actions at Philadelphia and Boston, though
quotations show only moderate decline and
sales at the three chief markets are almost as j
large an in 1892.
The wheat market Is just now somewhat
stronger, for although the Western receipts for
the week are 3,399,000 bushels, against 2,667,666
last year and for three weeks 2.900,000 larger,
the exports, flour included, have been for the
week from Atlantic ports 2,920.467 bushels,
against 1.824, bushels last year, and from
Pacific ports 824.153, against 1,376.827 last year,
other exports being 350.920 bushels. It Is not
possible to ignore the importance of so great
a demand extending beyond the middle of
March, and sober traders realize that It means
a heavier outgo than has been yet expected.
Western crop estimates are large, and such re
ports as appear of the condition of wheat for
the coming year are on the whole favorable,
but prices are 3%c higher than last week,
I while corn Is 2 1 Â«c higher. >. .-Â»;*'
Failures for the week have been 200 In the
! United States, against 251 last year, and 24 in
j Canada, against 21 last year.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March There was an ensy |
feeling in the start of the market and May j
opened }i@%c lower at 69Vi<cf69%c and slid off to '
CS%c 'luring the first hour's trading. There j
were no fresh reasons for weakness at the ;
time of opening, but bulls were disheartened j
at the apathy of traders In general and the j
i indifference with which reports of heavy dam- :
age to winter wheat was received. The bulls
considered the holding of wheat under such |
circumstances like love' labor lost and let ,
me drop Into the maws of the bears, who |
were short and were looking on the decline ,
with which the market started as the proper
tima to feed. The reports of winter killed
wheat from the country were numerous and
j fully corroborated previous advices of a simi
lar character. The action of the market how-
I ever, during the early trading clearly Indicated
a well-based belief that wheat was not nearly
so seriously damaged as had been claimed.
Indications were that the world's shipments
to Europe would be about 6,600,000 bushels for
the week. St. Louis bought wheat freely on j
the break and orders from the outside gener- i
ally were to buy. During the last half of the |
session reports from Kentucky said that the
wheat fields were being plowed up and general
complalnte from the Southwest were of almost I
sensational character, claiming that damage j
previously uninspected had revealed Itself.
. This sort of news started local â  shorts scram
: bling to cover. Offerings were found to be
very scarce, however, and after a vigorous
climb during the last hour of the session May
closed at 70% c.
Corn followed wheat, rallying eharply at the
close. The shorts and elevator people were
buyers on the way up. May closed Vie higher.
: Oats rallied with the other sralns, closing
firm at the high point. Vie higher. â â â -
' A good cash demand for meats and buying of
lard " and ribs by packing concerns strength
' ened provisions. May pork closed 7%c higher. j
Lard and ribs closed unchanged.

Another decline In Butter Is noted, and deal
ers look for still lower prices. â¢
Eggs are very firm and sales In a small
way at 17c are being made. Dealers are
averse to any further advance than is ab-
BOlutely necessary, for t they fear largely in
creased receipts and a corresponding s lump "
prices when the storm clears off. But* hen
it will clear off is a conundrum that makes
a gamble of the Egg market at the mo

were generally in the direction of higher prices,
though business was quiet, as usual.
Fluctuations in local securities were neither
numerous nor sharp, and the market was not
particularly active.

at Bodie for the week ending March 18 states
that on the 318 level forty Inches of low grade
ore is showing in the face of the north drirt.
Raise 3, same level, shows thirty inches of
low grade ore in the top. Raise* 5, same level,
shows fourteen inches fair grade ore. In
the winze below the 3SO-foot level the ore is
high grade. Good ore is showing in the raise
from the 470 level. The stopes are yielding ore
as usual, and are looking fairly well. Good
ore Is being extracted from the Fortuna vein,
on the 682-foot level. The north Btopes on the
2SO-ioot level are yielding some high grade ore.
On the 470-foot level the ore shows improve
ment. The mill was started up on the morn

kGRAVE CHARGES
MADE BY MRS.
ADAMS' LAWYERS
Bottle of Poison Tam
pered With.
THEY PROMISE A SENSATION
SAND REMOVED AND ACID
POUBED IN.
Second Day of the Examination of the
Woman Accused of Having
Murdered Her
Child.
The bottle containing the carbolic acid | ,
â which caused the death of baby Adams i
was formally introduced as evidence in I
the preliminary examination of Mrs. j '
Minnie Adams on a charge of poisoning
her child yesterday and the attorneys '
for the defense had the satisfaction of j
having It ordered into the keeping of I â 
the clerk. Mrs. Adams' lawyers are mak
ing much over this bottle, or rather they
c'iaira they â will later on. Attorney Swee
ney does not hesitate to assert that the
bottle has been tampered with since it I
was produced at the Coroner's inquest.
It now contains less than half a teaspoon
ful of carbolic acid, while a few grains of
sar.d adhere to the inner sides.
Mr. Sweeney stated after adjournment
that at the inquest the bottle contained
r.o liquid but considerable more sand than
it does now, and that the sand was dry.
He said, moreover, that the metal stop- I
per that screws over the top has been
tampered with, if not changed altogether,
for at the Inquest the top was smooth
and slipped on without any difficulty
whatever, while now there Is a dent in
It that requires some effort to put it on
cr remove it. The theory of the defense
is that this change would be made only j
for the purpose of disproving the claim
that the baby had- removed the stopper j
acd drank the contents.
Much of the afternoon was wasted in I
useless quibbling between the prosecution
and defense, and at the present rate of
progress the hearing bids fair to con
pr.me a week or more. After Dr. K. A.
Grosse had been called to tell what he !
did not know about the affair Miss Lena
Kenny took the witness stand. Miss Ken
ny lives next door to the Ten-ills and she
testified that on March 13 one of the Ter
riii boys called at her house and asked
her mother to go to his house, as his sla
ter's baby was sick. Miss Kenny went in
! place of her mother, and Mrs. Adams told j
Ver the baby had swallowed some car- i
bolic acid. They gave it a little salt and \
water and whisky and water, and witness
Bent one of the boys after a doctor. Mrs.
Adams told her about finding the baby at
the foot of the stairs with the bottle in !
Its hand, and that she had thrown the I
bottle over the fence into a vacant lot.
Miss Kenny .sent the other Terrill boy
cut to find the bottle, as she thought the ,
Coroner might want it in case the baby
Eddie Terrill, the 14-year-old brother of j
the defendant, testified that he was in the
basement during thÂ« forenoon, making a
wagon for the baby. The little one was
with him, laughing and playing around.
His sister came and took the child away.
Five minutes later he heard the baby
crying, and his sister said: "Oh, look at
the baby's mouth:" and ran upstairs
with it "He followed and. saw some stuff
on the baby's lips. His sister sent him
for Mrs. : any, and after Miss Kenny i
arrived he waa dispatched for a doctor.
Dr H A. Kieineyer testified that he ,
went to the Terrill house in response to
EddYs request and found the baby un
conscious. He treated it for carbolic acid |
poisoning and remained at the house
imtil after the child was dead. When he
reached the house the child was dressed.
but afterward its waist was removed, as
It was wet. He gave no instructions to
have it destroyed. the eight-year-old

brother of the- defendant, identified the

the day of the poisoning, and placed on

TIMELY RELIEF TO AVERT
A VAST IMPENDING FLOOD
Mountain View Cemetery Reservoir Believed to Have
Been Strengthened Before Too Late.
OAKL.AND. March 24.â The grave
danger that threatened the occu
pants of the many littje homes
in the vicinity of the Mountain View
Cemetery last night is now past. The
tremendous pressure of water on the up
per dam of the Mountain View reservo'r
was gradually reduced yesterday. This i 3
the first time since the reservoirs were
constructed that enough water collected
In them to overflow the banks, and for a
time threaten to sweep them before it and
rush madly down upon the homes in the
vicinity, leaving a harvest of destruction
ar.<l death in its wake.
If the break in the upper reservoir had
! not b*Â»en discovered Thursday night be
fore morning over 30,000,000 gallons of
water would have been racing over that
portion of Oakland between the cemetery
and Lake Merritt, carrying everything
before It in its mad rush to the lake.
A. D. Smith, superintendent of the
Mountain View Cemetery, was quick to
realize the impending danger when the
leak in the reservoir was nrst reported to
him Thursday. He hastily gathered a
force of men and put them to work filling
in red rook and barn refuse in the leaky
and Bhaky portions of the reservoir. 1 tie
men were kept at work all night and were
served hot coffee from time to time, which
was boiled in a tent erected close to the
reservoir. The leaky portion of the upper
reservoir dam was considerably Btrength
ened and reinforced yesterday under the
personal suporvislon of Mr. Smith.
All day long a steady four-foot Btream
of water poured down the concrete run
way that connects the upper and lower
reservoirs, and by night many thousand
gallons of water found its way into the
lower reservoir, thus relieving the tre
mendous strain on the upper reservoir
dam.
Before the recent storm the reservoirs
were almost dry and the cemetery offi
cials thought that they would bo under
the necessity of buying water next sum
mer as they did last summer. The pres
ent deluge was wholly unexpected. Dur
ing last years dry season the officials of
the Mountain View Cemetery made ex
tensive alterations in the upper and lower
reservoirs. Twenty thousand cubic yards

A LAWYER'S INTERPRETATION
ATTORNEY ACH'S ARGUMENT
IN RACETRACK CASE.
The Class of People That Grow Timid
in the Presence of Large
Bodies of Police
Officers.
Should the peculiar construction which
tho attorney of the bookmakers and pool
sellers places upon the duties of the police
officers of this city be established BO per
cent of the utility of the police force will
be lopped off. It will limit the territory
of the officer to the public street. He
must never on any pretext, cause or rea
son enter a door, gateway or entrance to
any house, tent or inclosure without a
license or warrant or some properly made
out order or authority demonstrating his
legal right to do so. Any house, tent or
inclosure used for any purpose is a man's
sacred habitation, home or castle. He may
be living therein; he may be operating a
circus therein; he may be running a faro
game therein; he may be carrying on a
notoriously disorderly class of amuse
ments therein. Citizens In that place may
be robbed of their property or physically
Injured, but the policeman must remain
on the sidewalk until he is morally cer

a crime if the proprietor of the place

The Mountain View Cemetery reser
voir? have a drainage area of thousands
of acres of hilly land along the old Jack
Hayes Canyon road. Thia accounts for
the sudden ripe in the reservoirs.
Every faucet in the cemetery was
opened all day yesterday and the water
ppoutÂ«*d out of them with great force. An
eight-inch outlet from the lower reservoir
reasonable doubt that a man has been
robbed or that another is lying within
injured he may rush himself to the near
est magistrate and worry out a warrant
for the arrest of somebody. Even then
he must be certain beyond a reasonable
doubt that the place hasn't movtxl away
or changed hands before he presumes to
intrude, because, according to Attorney
Ach for the defendants in the bookmaJcing
case, every man's place, dance hall, cor
ner groggery, circus tent, freak museum^
pool shop and racetrack is a man's castlo
and not to be profaned by a cop, even if
the chap within is believed to be a terror
in the way of smashing laws.
Of course such contention is a weak
prop under the case of the Ingleside race
people, who attempted to rough-ride over
a city ordinance. They broke a law and
"got 'rested " like a gang of youngster.-'
caught maliciously throwing rocka
through the window panes of a vacant
bouse. All day yesterday Mr. Ach threw
himself up against the solid wall of law
in his argument against the modification
Of the injunction i&sued*to restrain the
police from stopping poolselling and book
making at Ingloside. It will be remem
bered that Judge Daingerfield issued the
original injunction checking the police,
ana while the racetrack gamblers were in
the midst of a jubilee over their small
victory modified, the injunction, which
practically vacated thÂ© original order.
The result of this was a new batch of
lawbreakers fresh from Ingleside, who all
demanded Jury trials, which are to come
off. The hearing yesterday on the injunc
tion matter was before Judge Murasky in
Department S of the Superior Court. The
â  f the police and the people was rep
resented by District Attorney Murphy
and Garret McEneraey.
Attorney Henry Ach occupied the whole
day in his argument, which was that
the police had not a particle of right to
interfere with the pooiselllng at Inglesidq
on the mere supposition that some law
was broken or about to be broken, and
that the Pacific Coast Jockey Club was
entitled to heavy damages for this inter
ference. Mr. Ach calmly made this plea, j
notwithstanding the fact that the order
of the Board of Supervisors had been
passed and was a law.
Then the attorney went into an ex
haustive discussion on the duties of the j
police in the matter of making arrests, ;
and when the lawyer had finished the
blue-coated cop wasn't much more than
an ornament on the street corner. He
cannot, according to Mr. Ach, break into
a house, even to make an arrest in the
case of an unlawful act or game without
a warrant. He cannot, thinks Mr. Ach.
enter a shop and make an arrest, even
when the occupant is engaged in the un
lawful sale of liquor. Those places were
in a measure private places and could
not be entered, argued Mr. Ach, by po
lice officers without a warrant.
""What kind of a place is Ingleside?"
asked Mr. McEnerney. whose cross fire of
pointed questions during the day often
carried Ach off his feet.
"Ingleside is a. quasi-public place," was
the answer, "and the police had no more
right to enter to make arrests than they
have to enter my house. If the police
captain had been stopped from entering
those grounds as an officer he would only
have the right to bring suit for $100 dam
ages and not the right to break in."
"But the law says that he may go in/*
was allowed to run during the day and all
night last night to relieve the strain on
the 'iam. This water flowed Into the reg
ular water channels leading from the j
cemetery. Toward evening the water in |
the upper reservoir had receded to such |
an extent that all danger of it overflow
ing or breaking through the dam was j
considered over.
Despite the storm many sightseers jour
out to the cemetery and watched
the workmen repairing and reinforcing
the dam. The fears of # the neighboring ;
residents were quelled last evening by the j
assuring statements that the danger was I
over. A large force of workmen will re- \
main on the dam all night long to be I
ready to stop leaks In case any occur.
returned McEnerney, "and you first deny '
him his right, for fear he will afterward
interfere with what you consider to be
your ri;, r ht."
Mr. Ach read frnm a New York injunc
tion ca.se, whÂ»>re a French ball was riven
an excise license for the sale of food and
liquors and was placed under police sur- i
veillance by reason of this, ami argued
that only the issuing of this license made
the presence of the police legal.
"There never has been an Injunction
against the police that has held." said
Mr. McEnerney. "Not even in toe wide
open town <>f New York."
Attorney Ach was asked if an officer
saw from the outside of thÂ» track in
closure the commission of a crime within,
whether that ottlor would be permitted
to enter and make ;in arrest. Th<* ques
tion was evaded by the answer that Tli->
defendants wexe not seeking to restrain
an arrest in a violation of law. The law
yer then passed on to the enormity of the
offense on the part of the police in
marching to and fro on the racetrack
Railroad Across the English Channel.
The English Parliament is considering the
plan of connecting that country v.lth France
by railway. Engineers say a roadbed can be
laid on the bottom of the English Channel,
and by mounting trestlework on wheels, bo
that It projects above the water, the railway
can be operated. This seems beyond belief,
but It Is pertiaps no more remarkable than
some of the cures accomplished by Hostett-r's
Stomach Bitters In bad case? of dyspepsia. In-
digestion and constipation. This is an age of
wonderful achievements.

CLAM-HUNTERS`
HEAD STOCK
IN THE MUD
Leaped Off a High
Trestle.
HE TURNED A SOMERSAULT
6MALL BOY NARROWLY ES
CAPES DEATH.
\While Escaping From a Train George
Bunsen Dives Into the Water,
but He Is Ultimately
Rescued.
Oakland Office Sin Francisoo Call.
BOS Broadway, March 24.
George Bunaen is only 9 years old, but
yesterday he was called upon to decide
hurriedly whether he preferred certain
death from a train or to run the risk oX
being drowned in the estuary. Ho ac
cepted the risk and landed after a 20-foot
jump with his head in the mud. and his
lite was saved by the train hands.
Toui.g Birnsen was digging clams near
Sandy Beach; a short distance from
ralta street, and having tilled his sack be
started rosa the railroad yards or. his
way home. To shorten the distance he
walked alor.tr a trestle and did not notice
that a freight train that was backing onto
the scene of transit was almost upon him.
There was no spare space alongside the
rails and the boy had to choose between
the train and the water. Even when ex
posed to this disadvantage he did not
believe in losing the sack of clams that
lie had been busy gathering all day in the
gtorm.- ' _; .
The water was twenty feet from the tres
tle and when young Bunsen jumped he
held his sack of clams over his shoulder,
and in falling the big distance the clams
by their weight brought him head first
to the water. At that place there is only
about one foot of water and several feet
of mud, and the boy stuck there with his
feet in the air and his head in the mud.
The train hands saw the lad and lost
no time in climbing down the piles and
pulling out the boy. He was taken to a
drugstore, where it -was found that his
head was cut and he was seriously in
jured. He was taken home after being
patched up, but no permanent injury will
jesult from his experience.

Broadway, March 24.
-The coffers of charity will not be filled \
tty the proceeds of a debate between
Professor Jordan, General Barnes, Dr. R. ;
F. Coyle and Colonel Irish. A few weeks I
ago this scheme was proposed, but the
modesty of Professor Jordan and the
professional demands upon General
Barnes will not permit of it. The de- j
bate was being arranged in behalf of the
Associated Charities.
President Jordan threw the first dam
per on the scheme. In a very pleasant
letter he referred to the honor which the j
directors proposed to confer upon him, i
and then modestly referred to his possi- |
ble inability to engage in a debate. He j
eald he was no debater and had never j

tan incident that occurred at the County

Deputy Sheriff McGraw of Humboldt i
: â¢was a visitor at the County Jail to-day j
and expressed a desire to take a look at
'Brandes. The accused murderer .was j

DINGEE DEMURS
THAT SHE SLEPT
ON HER RIGHTS
Charges Made by Jane
Sather Answered.
A SNUG FORTUNE INVOLVED
MISAPPROPRIATION OP FUNDS
NOT SPECIFIED.
Dingee Alleges the Contract Between
Himself and Plaintiff Regard
ing His Agency Has Not
Been Canceled.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
90S Broadway, March 24.
William J. Dingee to-day filed a de
murrer against the complaint of Jane K.
Sather In the sensational suit wherein she
charges that he, aa her agent, misappro
priated funds belonging to her amounting
to $113,060 OS.
According to Mrs. Sather's complaint
Dingee became her agent in May, > V 7.
and on June 14, 1597, a settlement and ac
counting was effected. But she claims
that when she signed the Instruments she
had no information to know whether the
accounts were correct. Three months
later she discovered facts upon which she
based her suit, and last December she
made a demand for another and iinal set
tlement, which defendant has refused.
Mr. Dingee's demurrer Is to the effect
that Mrs. Sather's complaint does not
state facts sufficient to constitute a cause
of action or entitle her to any relief in
equity, on the following grounds:
Her complaint shows that there was a
final settlement had between plaintiff and
defendant on June 14, 1597. of all transac
tions and matters referred to, and at the
same time an account stated was agreed
upon; that within the three months next
thereafter plaintiff discovered that said
representations were false, and that de
fendant fraudulently appropriated to his
own uÂ«e the property and funds of
the plaintiff; that plaintiff did not
rescind said contract or attempt
to do so, nor eet aside for fraud
said settlement and account, nor
.->â . k to surcharge or falsify- the same
for error, ndr act upon such discovery
until December 28, 1898; and therein plain
tiff slept upon her rights, if she had any,
was not vigilant and did not exercise or
act with reasonable diligence upon such
discovery, and has been guilty of unrea
sonable delay and is accordingly barred
from maintaining this action under the
provisions of subdivisions 1 and 2 ot sec
tion 1091 of the Civil Code."
Ttfe demurrer then recites Instances
wherein the complaint is uncertain:
That it is not clear as to what represen
tations made by plaintiff were false and
fraudulent; whether it is meant that the
representation .that "he had great ca
pacity and ability in the management,
purchase and sale of real estate,' etc.,
and "would take from ruer the whole
care and responsibility of her property"
and "would be her friend and banker
and might "draw u-on him in the same
manner as she would upon a bank, and
the like were false and fraudulent, and
if false and fraudulent to \what de
gree false and wherein fraudulent; or if
it is Intended to surcharge and falsify for
error the account stated and settlement
' "The defendant asks ' to be dismissed
with his costs.

BIGLER IGNORED A
TELEPHONE SUBPENA
WITNESS BEFTJSED TO APOLO
GIZE TO THE COUBT.
J. B. Bigler in the Case of Hatcher
Against Ex-Sherirf WLita Is
Adjudged Guilty of Con
tempt of Court.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
90S Broadway, March 24.
Superior Judge Greene this afternoon
established the remarkable precedent
that a telephone subpena must be
treated with the same dignity and re
spect as any other order of the court,
and J. R. Bigler of Alameda was lined
and severely criticized because he had
treated the summons as a trivial matter.
It was at the trial of the suit of B. M.
Hatcher of San Jose against C. B. White,
t-x-Sheriff, and his former bondsmen.
Hatcher held a note for $1800 against J.
H. Bigler. proprietor of the Stanford sta
bles, Alameda. and to enforce his claim
attached Bigler's property. The latter,
however, gave a bond -with E. A. Rand
lett and R. R. Lomax as his sponsors,
and this bond, it was afterward found,
was no more substantial than the straw
strewn in the horses' stall. The attach
ment, nevertheless, had been released on
the strength of its weakness. Hence
Hatcher had sued ex-Sheriff White and
his bondsmen.
During the trial this morning Mr. Big
ler had occupied the witness stand and
testified as to the value of certain steeds,
equipages, etc. His answers did not come
the way Attorney D. W. Borchurd wanted
them to, and in reframiiig a certain ob
i^ible question the attorney had
disturbed the usual tranquillity of Judge
Greene, who advised him not to repeat
such questions again. "If you do," said
the Judge, "the counsel on the other side
will jump on you, and ! will jump on you
hard. You have put this witness i<n the
stand in good faith and are now trying
to make him testify three ways."
Witness Bigler summarily determined
that he should not be called again at this"
afternoon's session of the court. He was
called, however, and failing to respond
Attorney N. E. Wretman was advised by
Judge Greene to call Bigler up by tele
phone and inform him to come to court.
Attorney Wretman did so and the wires
grew hot with Bigler's indignation. "I
will come to court when they send the
bailiff after me," replied Bigler.. He was
taken at his word, and Judge Greene de
tailed Deputy Sheriff Striker to hale the
witness to court.
"You were aware that this court sum
moned you by 'telephone?" inquiringly
said Judge Greene, when Bigler appeared
lln the clutches of Striker. There was no
denying the question.
"Well, then," continued Judge Greene
in stentorian tones, "you are perhaps an
old mar., but it is never too late to learn
a lesson. Your refusal to answer this
summons amounts to contempt of court,
and you can either apologize or be fined
$5. or take one day in jail."
"All I have to say is that I'm sorry,
responded the tardy witness.
"That Is not a satisfactory apology, and
I want you to understand that you will

MR. MOODY'S ADDRESS
TO THE CHURCHGOER
A GENTLE EXHORTATION TO A
DEEPER FAITH.
"There Is No Darkness to the De
parting Christian in the Valley
of the Shadow of Death."
Evangelist Dwiq-ht L. Moody continued
his sermon to religious people yesterday
afternoon in the First Congregational
Church. Every svat in the large edifice
was filled, the aisles being 1 crowded to
the outer doors. The speaker, in his
characteristic way, admonished both pas
tor and people to be united in the service
of the Master. Strangers would come in
through the open gates of the church
when they saw light and warmth within
the place. It was a tender exhortation
for a deeper religious faith and the
spreading of the divine truth around.
The evening service Included the usual
songs and prayers by the different minis
ters on the platform and a sermon by
Mr. Moody drawn from the second chap
ter "f Paul's epistle to Titusâ the last
eleven verses. It was a discourse upon
the everlasting promise of the Christian
life. Referring to the twenty-third
Psalm, fourth verse- Mr. Moody said s I
liirni was it read aright. It is; "Yea,
though I walk through the. valley of the
shadow of death I will fear do evil; for
thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff
they comfort me."
"They persist," said the speaker, "in
putting the word 'dark' before "shadow.'
There is nothing dark there, and the
shadow is there only because there is a
great light near by. There must be a
light to make a shadow. So far as I am
concerned I will fear no evil when the
Maze of that glory comes down through
the valley of the shadow of death."
There will be a service in the First Con
gregational Church this morning at 9
o'clock and also this afternoon at 3.
PAWNED HER GOLD WATCH.
How Henry Boggs Raised Money to
Pay for a Dinner for Two.
Henry Boggs, a commercial traveler,
was arrested yesterday morning- by De
tectives Ryan and ODea on a warrant
charging him with felony embezzlement.
The complaining witness is Lizzie Hart
1532 Eddy street.
P.orps until a few months ago lived at
the same bouse with his wife, who finally
left him. The day before Boggs departed
Miss Hart had occasion to mention in his
hearing that she wanted her gold watch,
valued at $1.".v, repaired, and Boggs said
he would have it attended to by a friend
of his without cost. Miss Hart" gave him
the watch and since then she has not seen
him. A few days ago she learned that
the watch had been pawned by Boggs for
(6, and she swore to the complaint charg
ing him with embezzlement.
Boggs says that he was on friendly
terms with Miss Hart and had asked her
out to dine with him. He had no funds
and he borrowed her -watch, which ho
pawned to get money to pay for the din
ner. He intended to take it out of pawn
as soon as he was able, but times had
been hard with him.
The detectives say that Mrs. Miller, the
landlady at 1532 Eddy street, will also
swear out a warrant for Boggs' arrest on
the charge of defrauding an innkeeper,
as he is owing her ahqut $40 for board and
lodging. A dealer in notions named Hall
is also after him for embezzling $40 worth
of goods, which he got as samples and
did not account for.
Murder or Manslaughter.
The preliminary examination of Philip
Ferttitta, charged with the murder of Jo
seph Sierro on Sansome street February 24,
was held before Judge Graham yesterday.
A number of witnesses were examined
and for the defense it was claimed that
the defendant acted in self-defense. The
Judge said he would give his decision to
day as to whether he would hold the de
fendant to answer on the charge of mur
der or manslaughter.
Knockea Down by a Hack.
Peter Brandt, residing at 3226 Pierce
street, was knocked down by a hack at
Stockton arid Market streets last night.
The driver of the vehicle nt once whipped
up his horses and drove away. He was
followed by Officer Smith, who' found that
the hack number was 20S. Brandt was
taken to the Receiving Hospital, where it
was discovered that he had sustained a
fracture of the forearm and his shoulder
was dislocated.
Wheelmen at the Ferry.
Manager Fillmore of the Southern Pa
cific Company yesterday issued an order
to go into effect to-day, allowing wheel
men to enter the ferry building by way of
the carriage entrance on the south side
instead of requiring them to force tholr
way through the passenger gates, as here
tofore, a course which has l>eon annoying
to both the cyclers and pedestrians.
The Calvarian Society.
At 3 o'clock to-morrow afternoon the
closing exercises of the Calvarian So
ciety will be held at St. Mary's Cthedral.
The speaker on this occasion will be the
Archbishop's secretary. Rev. P. E. Mulli
gan. The "Way of the Cross" will be
made, and benediction will conclude the
afternoon's services.
WILL MEET,
BUT ONLY TO
SAY FAREWELL
Work of the Retiring
Councilmen.
VIRTUES OF THE "SOLID SIX"
HENNEBERRYS GOOD WORK ON
THE STREETS.
Woodward Has the Gratitude of the
Fifth Wardâ Heitman a Mas
ter Hand at the
Gavel.
Oakland Office Ran Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, March 24.
Next Monday evening the City Council
vrill meet for a few minutes, but no busi
ness will be transacted except approving
the report of the last meeting. The mem
bers will then bid the council chamber
farewell, and seven of the eleven will re
tire to private life.
Now that the half dozen members con
stituting the majority are about to retire
many expressions of approval are heard
regarding a large portion of their work
as city officials. Of course It will be a
long time before the memory of the water
scandal of last spring is forgotten, and it
would be useless for any one to attempt
an explanation of that affair, for the
public mind formed its own opinion and
it could not well be shaken.
The six men who ligure most promi
nently are Messrs. Henneberry, Earl,
Watklnson, Hitman, Brosnahan and
Woodward. Apart from the water rate
business each of these men has a .record
of much useful work. Councilman Henne
berry has been chairman of the Street
Committee, and every one knows that
Oakland's streets are in a better condi-
Uon to-day than ever. While this is pri
n arily due to the efforts of Street Super
h tendent Miller, his work has been con
siderably expedited and encouraged by
Mr. Henneberry. Himself a teamster, the
chairman of the committee gave much of
i, s time to personal inspection of street
work and necessities, and retires from of
fice as die of the most efficient coinmlt
tee chairmen of the City Council.
Major Woodward, who possessed the
unhappy faculty of putting himself where
he would be subject to most unpleasant
ness, has done, it is said, more for the
Fifth Ward than any Councilman from
thai district. Members of the Lakeside
improvement Club have testified to Mr.
Woodward's activity on behalf of his dis
trict. Large Improvements have been
started, and he haa obtained for Fifth
Ward improvements more money than
any of his predecessors.
Councilman Heitman is known as one of
the best parliamentarians that has ever
held nfflct: at the City Hall. His methods
of doing business have the respect of all
of his fellow members, and his activity
in behalf of certain improvements was
recognized not long ago by the presenta
tion of a silver-mounted gavel.
i "ouncilman Brosnahan, with the excep
tion of his unfortunate display of anger
last soring and his vote on the water
rates has served four terms, which of it
self is proof that his constituency ap
proved of his course.
"Billy" Wntkinson ha-s been returned
several times from the Sixth Ward and
lias attended to his duties well, and but
for the "tie fatal exception he, too, might
lie his nwn successor.
On Monday. April 3. the new Council
will take office and will organize with H.
1). Rowe as president.
SUPERVISORS CONSIDER
MANY WEIGHTY MATTERS
WILL CALL FOR BIDS FOR NEW
POLICE STATION.
City and County Hospital May Be
Located on Almshous* Tract.
Hall of Justice.
The Supervisors will have many
weighty matters upon which to pass at
thrir next meeting. The Building Com
mittee will recommend that bids be called
for on the proposed police station in the
Mission and also for the furnishing of the
Hall of Justice. Under the modified plans
presented by Architect Shea the station
ran be built for the $40,000 which has been
set aside for the purpose. By simplifying
the chairs and desks in the Hall of Jus
tice the original figures for its furnishing
have been reduced $fi4oo. It was decided at
a meeting of the Building Committee yes
terday that separate bids would be called
for for the different kinds of fitting sup
plied. Thus a dealer in desks will bid
only on desks, and not on gas fittings and
other materials.
Chairman Holland informed his asso
ciates on the Building Comm'tteÂ» v â¢
day that Contractor Bateman had assured
him that the building would be reauj w
July.
Among the other Improvements to be
recommended on Monday will be that of
a new City and County Hospital to re
place the ramshackle affair now doing
duty, chairman Attridge has found fif
teen acres on the Almshouse tract which
he believes would make an Ideal site for
this great public Institution.
Representatives of the Mutual Electric
T.ight Company appeared before the Su
pervisors yesterday In support of their of
fer to light th" (MO' Hall 40 per cent
cheaper than it Is being done. The matter
wns taken under advisement. Supervisor
Perrault endeavored to draw from Super
visors Collins and Attridge their majority
report on the gas question r.ow pending
before the board. Both declined to sign
the minority report, saying they would
present their figures on Monday.
B/OTTNDS GETS SIX MONTHS.
Escaped Conviction in the Federal
Courts, but Judge Conlan Pun
ishes Him.
"William H. Rounds alias Charles Craw
ford alias Sanford was yesterday sent
to the County Jail for six months by
Judge Conlan. on a charge of vagrancy,
much to the delight of tfie police. The
Judge said he would in the future deal
severely with all bunko men .brought be
fore him, as they were a pest to the com
munity.
Rounds is a well-known bunco man and
was arrested at the Cliff House about
three weeks ago. When searched two
bills that had been raised were found in
his pockets and he v.as handed over to
the Federal authorities. He escaped
conviction and was again turned over to
the police, who booked him on the charge
of vagrancy.
In the Divorce Court.
Conrad Miller has been granted a di
vorce from Lutie Miller on the ground of
willful desertion. Martha R. Lascelle has
been granted a divorce from Harvey W.
Lasceile on the ground of infidelity. The
plaintiff was allowed to resume her
maiden name. Welsh. Decrees of divorce
have alpo been granted Hulda B. Wise
frcm Virgil Wise on the ground of failure
to provide, Annie L. Robinson from
James G. Robinson on the ground of ex

from Jewel L. Holmes on the ground of
desertion. Suits for divorce have been
filed by John Ziegler against Lillie Ziegler
for desertion and Maggie LÂ«. Eggerts
against F. W. Eggerts for failure to pro

WILL CONTROL SOUTHERN
PACIFIC PASSENGER TRAFFIC
t 0. McCormick, Huntington's Latest
Appointee, Arrives and Goes
Into Conference.
EO. McCORMICK, the newly ap
pointed passenger traffic manager
of the Southern Pacific Company.
' arrived here yesterday morning
md Is stopping at the Palace Hotel. The
position he will occupy Is a new one with
the Huntington corporation, and he will
not undertake its duties until May 1. He
is to have charge of the entire passenger
business of the company, including that
of the Sirtiset route, the Central Pacific,
the Shasta route and all the various
branches of the Southern Pacific system.
He will report to J. C. Btubbs, third vice
president and traffic manager, and will
relieve both the latter and General Pas
senger Agent Goodman of considerable
of the work that now falls to them. No
â¢hanges in the existing official personnel
<jf the company are contemplated.
On Mr. McCormick's arrival at the Pal
ace he was met by a number of the gen
tlemen who are to be his confreres and
given a cordial welcome. Later he vis
ited Mr. Stubbs and Mr. Goodman at their
respective offices and was in conference
with them for the purpose of familiariz
ing himself with the territory over which
he is to have Jurisdiction and with the
luties of his position.
Mr McCormick is a comparatively
young man. and his rise in the railroad
world has been phenomenal. He Is about
41 years of age. and engaged in railroad-
Ing for the first time about twenty years
ago. Previous to that time he had done
considerable newspaper work, his first
connection having been with the Jour
nal of Lafayette, Indiana. He entered
the Bervlce of the Lake Erie and West
ern as ticket stock clerk in September,
1579, and was later timekeeper for the
construction department of that road.
\fter being employed In the freight de
partment of the Monon route he went to
Louisville, Kentucky, as the general
agent of the Great Eastern Fast Freight
line, and then found occupation in the
city passenger and ticket agency of the
HE RETURNS
FOR A PARENT'S
FORGIVENESS
J. B. Chichizola Home
With. His Bride.
WAS MARRIED LAST SUNDAY
DISREGARDED HIS FATHER'S
STERN OBJECTION.
Miss May Garcia, a Young Lady of
Oakland, Is His Wife â Cere
mony Performed in
That City.
After the last prayef of high mass had
been concluded In St. Joseph's Portuguese
church In Oakland Sunday morning, John
\\. Cnicblsola of this city and Miss May
Garcia of Oakland stepped before the
altar and were made man and wife by
Rev. Father Gloria. Tn the story of this
union the old hackneyed saw that "love
laughs at locksmithÃ" finds itself re
peated. In short, it is a tale of two
hearts that found a way to defeat the
plans of a stern parent.
Chichizola is a son of A. Chichizola, the
prominent wholesale grocer at 316-318 Pa
cific street and also a member of the
firm. About a year ago he met pretty
Miss Garcia, loved her and they were
later engaged. However, the girl was
poor, ana in this fact his father found ob
jection to the match. The lovers per
sisted in pleading for consent, out only
found that nothing could reconcile his
father to the proposition. After hesitat
ing for some time, the young man con.
eluded, that matters touching his own
happiness should be dealt with by him
self. He is 27 years of age, while Miss
May is but 18.
On Sunday morning he journeyed to
Oakland without the knowledge of his
folks. There he married the girl of his
choice. When the father heard of it soon
afterward he was furious, and it was
only after a mother's intercession for sev
eral days that the groom was forgiven,
invited to return to the home of his
youth and the fatted calf killed.
Meanwhile the couple had been spend
ing their honeymoon in San Jose. When
they returned to this city a couple of
days ago they took apartments at a
downtown hotel, where they bofti re
ceived forgiveness and blessing. John
was told to find a flat which suited his
fancy and to fit It ufi. In giving these
Fame enrnpany, whence he was promoted
! successively to be the northern passen
ger agent at Chicago and to service in
the general passenger and ticket agency
of the road. Hi? next position was gen
! eral passenger and ticket -agent of the
Cincinnati, Hamilton and Dayton, one of
the greatest local lines In the State of
Ohio. He began his service with the
Cleveland. Cincinnati. Chicago and St.
I ouls Railroad, popularly known as the
j Big Four, in September, 1893, taking the
: position of passenger traffic manager.
which office he is now holding and which
' he will relinquish when he i>akes up his
new duties. He has also been president
of the American Association of General
' Passenger and Ticket Agents, which com
; prises every road in the United States
and Canada.
In his new position Mr. McCormlck will
: enter upon a much wider field of opera
i tlon. With the. Big Four he has the su
{ pervision of passenger traffic over 8360
I miles, whfle the traekag-e of the South
l crn Pacific system Is nearly 7500 miles.
' He will also have to 'leal with numerous
! complications that have arisen In the
local situation recently by reason of the
advent of the Santa Fe road as a direct
competitor of the Southern Pacific for
both local and through business.
This is his first visit to the Pacific
I Coastâ ln fact, he had never been west of
Salt Lake City till he made the trip to
San Francisco. For this reason and for
the further one that he has not yet en
tered the employ of the Southern Pa
cine, he declined to discuss any matter
relating to hla future course, saying it
would be "not only imprudent, but im
pertinent." He will return to Cincin
nati, where his headquarters now are,
some day next week. He comes with
the reputation of being an extremely
"good fellow," as well as an able ralt
road man, and the impression he made
yesterday among his future associates
fully bears out this report in every par
ticular.
directions, the father told his son not to
do so on the installment plan, but to use
his credit for anything necessary. The
flat was located at 1013 Green street, and
yesterday afternoon young Mrs. Ohichi
zola, her mother-in-law and sister-in-law
visited various furniture stores to make
selections.
This is not the first occasion in which
a member of the Chichizola family has
erred In the choice of a life partner, ac
cording: to the judgment of the fathor.
On April 25, 1596, Thomas, another son,
married under about the same conditions
and after parental forgiveness. Incited by
the pleadings of the good mother, a flat
was fitted up for him out of the family
treasury at 1100 Green street, where he
still resides;

COMPTON IS AFTER
THE CROWN LANDS
Secret of the General's Mission to
the Hawaiian Islands.
The Great Case of Ex=Queen Liiiuokalani Against the
Government of the United States Will
Be Heard at Honolulu.
The mission of General Charles E.
Comptou to the Hawaiian Islands is Ihe
subject of great speculation in Federal
circles In this city. General Compton
left his post as commandant of the
I'nsldio and sailed on the Alameda
a few days ago for Hono
lulu. "While no ono is in a position to
explain authoritatively the purpose of
the distinguished soldier's journey, it
1? understood from excellent sources
ihat he has gone to Honolulu to seize
the crown lands of the former mon
archy and by authority of the Ameri
can Government settle, a dispute Â«-.f
ownership that involves property worth
millions of dollars.
The ex-Queen, Liliunkalani. has bc-:en
In Washington ever since she was de
posed as reigning sovereign of the Ha
waiian Islands. She has fought, with
a persistency inspired by a lost cause.
LILIUOKALANI, whose great struggle for the
crown lands of Hawaii is nearing its end.
to regain the valuable crown lands that
passed into the possession of the pro
visional Government of Hawaii and
thence to the republic The ex-Queen
demands the crown lands as hers by
virtue of her former sovereignty. She
has been surrounded by an influential
coteries of advisers and supporters,
chief among whom, perhaps, is Paul
Neumann. The ex-Quenn has appealed
to Congress to confirm her assumed
ownership of the lands in dispute and
to do her what she insists Is simple
justice.
The controversy has been a matter of
concern to the Government at "Wash
ington for some time. The utmost
secrecy has been maintained In refer
ence to all discussion of the affair, but
It Is understood now that some decision
â will soon be reached. To facilitate
that end, to seize the crown lands, as-
PAUL NEUMANN, who will watch the Queen's in
terests at Honolulu. \
Bert sovereignty in the name of the
United States and Investigate impar
tially all the claims of Liliuokalani are
the instructions, it ia claimed, which
General Compton has received.
It is something more than a coinci
dence that Paul Neumann hastily left
Washington a short time ago and is
now on his way to Honolulu. Neumann
is one of the closest advisers of the ex-
Queen and in any investigation affect
ing her interests he would be of Invalu
able assistance. His opportune jour
ney to the Hawaiian Islands may have
been timed. Official secrets are some
times whispered even in Washington.
The crown lands of Hawaii are a prize
well worth winning. They are of im
mense and rapidly increasing value and
even now yield a yearly revenue of
(75,000. If the ex-Queen were to regain
them she would become one of the rich-
est land-owners on the Western conti
nent. It is believed that the ex-Queen's
financial fate is now in the hands of
General Compton.
The creation of the crown lands, for
which Liliuokalanl Is struggling, con
stitutes one of the most interesting
bits of Hawaiian history. The argu
ments for and against the Queen's
claim to possession find their source
deep In the life of the island kingdom
which is now a part of the United
States. The story begins with the cen
tury when conquering warriors made
the natives their vassals and seized the
beautiful islands as their own. The
narrative proceeds through years of a
strange modern feudalism, which de
veloped ultimately into the establish
ment of nineteenth century laws of
property rights and possession. Here
and there in the story is the clash of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 25. 1899.
A SUCCESSOR TO
FATHER YORKE
Reverend Father P. Scanlon, the New Chancellor of the Archdiocese
of San Francisco.
THRHT'GH the last Issue of the Catholic directory the Interesting In
formation is announced that there has been appointed a successor to
Father P. C. Yorke as chancellor of the archdiocese of San Francis
co. The honor has fallen to Rev. Father Scanlon, of St. Joseph's
Church.
When Father Yorke resigned his position as editor of the Monitor last
October ft was that he hart resigned his place as Chancellor of
the diocese. It whs soon after that the appointment of Father Scanlon was
made by the Archbishop, but so quietly was the position filled that it was
not known even among the clorgv until the directory for this year was is
sued with Father Scanlon's name where rmro was Father Yorke's.
Father Scanlon, the now Chancellor, has been a priest in this city for
the past seventeen years, during- which time he has occupied the pulpit 01
Pt Joseph's Church. He has also under his charge the St. Joseph paro
chial school, which is attended by over 600 pupils ;ind which has crown
steadily under his management. Before taking charge of St. Joseph's
Church Father Scanlon was pastor of St. Rose's Church In Sacramento, a
position he held for fifteen years. He was educated and waa ordained in
All Hallows College in Dublin.
Father Yorke, the former Chancellor, was one of the foremost men in
the Catholic church of this roast. For five years he was editor of the Moni
tor the organ of the church, and in his hands it became the open and im
placable enemy of anti-Catholic organizations. He first rose to local promi
nence during the controversy with Donald Ross and others of the American
Protective Association, and the war he afterward waged on all branches of
that society. He was a master at controversy and he had an enormous
capacity for work. He made many friends and almost as many enemies, but
throughout his whole career he was consistent and never swerved from the
path he had laid out for himself. He asked for a vacation last November
and was allowed to take a trip to Ireland, which he intended should last
The position he resigned is an honorary one. It is intended that the
Chancellor shall assist the Bishop, but in the diocepe of Ran Francisco the
Archbishop has taken most of the work upon himself and fn"e office of
Chancellor is not an arduous one. The appointment Is at the will of the
Archbishop.
rival dynasties and the influence of a
i dominating race.
All of these incidents will form chap
ters in the inquiry that will determine
once and for all whether Queen Lilluo
kalani or the Government of the United
i States owns the crown lands of Hawaii.
The testimony in this great case be
tween a woman and a nation will begin
with the story of a conquest. Early in
this century the Hawaiian Islands wore
conquered and their people subjugated.
That was before the missionaries came
and the conquered people were, allowed
to hold the lands they occupied as fiefs
under a system similar to that of the
feudal ages. Possession was at the
j pleasure of the King and in considera
tion of certain services. The conquer
ors set up their King in the person of
| Kamehameha I, known then and now
| for his success at arms as the Napoleon
!of the Pacific. With this monarch a
! new dynasty was created and in this
dynasty the crown lands of Hawaii find
their origin.
For over forty years there happened
nothing that bears materially upon the
history of the crown lands. The people
of the islands held their lands as fiefs,
and questioned neither the right -if the
King nor the justice of his acts. In the
early forties, however, the then reign
ing Kamehameha determined to effect
a sweeping reform and to apportion
equitably all the lands of the kingdom
which he owned by virtue of his abso
lute power.
A land commission was appointed and
decided to make three great divisions
of the land of the kingdom. The na
tives that held bona fide holdings as
fiefs were given absolute deeds of own
ership to the property they held in con
sideration of certain awards to the
Government. In this way the natives
passed from the condition of vassals to
that of freemen and their property was
transferred from fiefs to unlncumbered
holdings.
The seoond division constituted a res
ervation of certain tracts of land to the
Government to be known as Govern
ment lands and to be used exclusively
for the benefit of the Hawaiian Govern
ment. These lands may be rented,
leased or sold, as the governing com
mission. In its discretion, may decide.
The third and last labor of the Land
Commission of the Kamehameha was
the creation of the crown lands. Cer
tain tracts of land were set aside for
the exclusive benefit of the crown for
the support of the reigning sovereign.
It is in this connection that the critical
point in the controversy between Lili
uokalani and the Government of the
United States arises. . , . - . j
It was specifically provided that these
crown lands could not be sold nor in
any way alienated from the purpose
for which they were created. They
could be rented, and are now rented,
in large measure, for heavy rentals.
They could be leased for r.o lougor
period, however, than twenty-five
years. These provisions show clearly
that the crown lands were to , remain
intact for the benefit of the crown.
The next provision and one vital to
the issue between Liliuokalanl and the
United States Government is that the
reigning sovereign was to receive only
the â  revenue of the crown lands. No
where is it provided that the crown was
to be given absolute possession or a
j&ove>vtv T jrjglit in fee simpje to Â£ho
â¢âââ¢-- -**â¢ -*â â * â¢ Â
land?. The title and the ownership of !
the crown lands remained with the
Government of Hawaii, which is now
that of the "United States. This fact
will throw in the path of Liliuokalani
the first stumbling block to the claim
of ownership.
In outline this Is the condition of the
Hawaiian land system, as far as the
ownership of the crown lands is con
i cerned. There has never been any dis
pute In reference to the private hold
ings, which are known as Kuleanas.
No one has ever questioned the title to
the Government lands, which are
i rented, leased or sold to the highest
j bidder. From the creation of the land
j system these two great divisions have
been above dispute. The status of the
crown lands was the same as these
until there came a change of dynasties
and in the setting of the star of the
Kamehamehas a new royal family as
cended the Hawaiian throne.
The first of the new line, Lunalllo, as
cended the throne in 1873, reigned a
year and died. There was a bitter fight
for the succession between Kalakaua
and Queen Emma, the Queen Dowager
of the last male Kamehameha. Kala
i kaua, assisted by the powerful white
j element in the Hawaiian Legislature,
; won. The selection of the King had
I been by legislative election, because
i the last male Kamehameha had died
without nominating a successor.
With Kalukaua came a new race to
the Hawaiian throne, and here again,
in this fact. Liliuokalani will meet with
difficulty in establishing her claim to
the ownership of the crown lands. She
â¢will have to supply a double proof
first that the Kamehamehas retained
personal ownership of the crown lands
and that she as a successor to their
throne inherited their property. And
when she has made both of these ex
planations she must still make a third,
more difficult than the other two, for
the Hawaiian Government bought what
it believed to be an Interest In the
crown lands derived from a Kameha
meha.
The incident of this purchase is of
timely Interest. When the last male
Kamehameha died he left as his heir a
sister named Ruth Keleekolani. This
woman never asserted any rights to the
crown lands because a new dynasty
was on the throne. She did claim, how
ever, that she should have been given
the crown lands as surviving heir of
the last Kamehameha. About fifteen
years ago Claus Spreckels purchased
from j this woman all the rights of
ownership which she might possess as
heiress of the Kamehameha in the
crown lands. The Hawaiian Govern
ment considered this purchase of the
gravest importance. ' Negotiations were
begun, and the Hawaiian Government
gave Claus Spreckels part of the lands
upon which the Hawaiian Commercial
and Sugar Company is located in ex
change for the deeds which had been
bought from Ruth Keleekolani. The
transfer was formally confirmed by the
Hawaiian Legislature.
This transaction Is of exceptional im
portance, as it shows clearly that the
Hawaiian Government, at least, be
lieved that the title of the crown lands
rested, if It rested anywhere else than
In the Government itself, in the family
of the Kamehameha. Liliuokalani will
have to meet this fact, as well as prove
her ownership, although she possesses
no family title and never received any
thing more from the crown lands than
their revenue, which came to her as
reigning Queen of the Hawaiian
Islands*-.. , (

FAVORITES RAN
WELL TO FORM
AT OAKLAND
Obsidian the Only
Beaten Choice.
SAINTLY FINALLY WINS OUT
IMPERIOUS AT LONG ODDS
BEAT WYOMING.
Stamina With Reiff Up Landed First
in a Sensational Finish â Dr.
Rowell's Stable Suspend
ed for 30 Days.
The books were bombarded at Oakland
track yesterday, every choice going
through with the exception of Obsidian.
The track was ankle deep with mud, but
there still remained good, firm footing.
The attendance was fair considering the
unsettled state of the weather.
For the opening five and a half furlong
scramble Magdalenas opened favorite, but
the stable did not seem very sweet on the
filly's chances, and she receded In the bet
ting. Saintly had the call at post time, and
with Hennessy in the saddle, won easily
from Ocorona. Polka, on which quite a
warm tip was circulated, ran third.
Everybody seemed to be aware of the
fact that Truxlllo reveled in sloppy foot
ing, and from even money his odds were
quickly rubbed to 3 to 5. Eddie Jones
managed to maintain the lead with Hora
tio until the paddock was reached, where
the favorite forged to the front, winning
Cleverly by a length in 1:16. Old Don Fu
lano, well backed at 7 to 1, finished in the
show.
Morbid, the entry of "Walter Jennings,
closed a pronounced favorite for the two
year-old scramble. Spencer got the lilly
away well to an uneven break, and lead
ing throughout, beat Loch Katrine in a
hard drive. Away on equal terms, the lat
ter would have scored. Prestome, the sec
ond choice, was unable to get inside the
money.
Johnny Reiff put up a rare good ride on
Stamina, favorite for the sprint next de
cided, succeeding in getting through and
winning after looking hopelessly out of
it. To a straggling start Genua, Ach and
Good Hope, were away first, leading the
bunch into the stretch heads apart. At
this stage both the favorite and ""it 1 " "i
did not seem to have a chance. The lead
ers tired, though, ana in...,, vi. i
strongest finishes, Relff landed his mount
at the wire first, half a length before
Montanus. With a respectable ride Good
Hope would have taken the purse, but
McNichols went all to pieces on her at
the paddock.
The surprise of the day came in the
mile and a sixteenth selling run. Going
to the post at odds of 10 to 1, Dr. Rowell's
recent purchase, Imperious, locked horns
with Wyoming in the sail home, and
chiefly through Spencer's corkscrew finish
on the latter horse, earned the verdict by
a narrow margin. The last race of the
winner was a very poor one. and he was
practically overlooked. Devin was unable
to ride the 7 to 10 favorite. Obsidian, to
any advantage. : :,
For the closing race of the day, a six
furlong sprint, Ruskin, with Spencer up,
was heralded as the good thing. Sent out
an 8 to 5 favorite, Sydney Paget's entry
led Widow Jones over the mark with lit
tle to space.
Track Notes, i
The rich $10,000 Burns handicap will be
the feature of the sport at Oakland this
afternoon.
The muscles in Jockey Biillman's in
jured shoulder are still so sore that he
has decided not to ride to-day. The prom
ising rider will shortly pay a visit to his
home in Montana.
For the Improvement in form shown by

sky Barnes. Foote and others come in for
comment this week. Amateur Sport is
also an entertaining department, the lat
est news of athletes being given by
Olympian. Willard Batchelder writes of
the grand opera and the Bostonlans, and
the musical and dramatic columns sparkle
with vivacious news. There is a trans
lation of one of Pssifs pretty love stories
by Alice Ziska. The Saunterer has eight
rages of satirical brilliancies in the line
of social, club and political paragraphs.
Walter Martin's latest, a Burlingame
tale, and the Milton Garratt divorce are
touched upon. Town Talk's jokelets are
being quoted everywhere for their clever
ness and originality. Clancys Philoso
phies are also much talked about; they
are capital imitations of the Dooley
style. Clancy this week talks about "The
