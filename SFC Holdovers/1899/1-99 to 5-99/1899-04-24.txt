COL. STOTSENBURG
KILLED IN BATTLE
WASHINGTON, April 23. â Colonel John Miller Stotsenburg of the
First Nebraska Infantry, who held rank of captain in the regular
army, killed in the reconnolssance at Quengua, was born in In
diana, November 24, 1858, and appointed a cadet at the Military
Academy July, 1877, and graduated No. 41 in his class. He was ap
pointed second lieutenant of the Sixth Cavalry in 1881 and became a captain
December 14, 1898. He served with his regiment in Arizona and New Mex
ico from 18S?' to IS9O, at the dose of the latter year participating in the
Sioux campaign in the war at 'Wounded Knee. He was at Fort Niobarara
and served for a few months at Fort Myer, near Washington, going thence
to the Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth, Kans., where he
graduated with distinguished honors. Colonel Stotsenburg then served with
his regiment at Fort Leavenworth until December, 1897, and from that time
â¢to the following April was professor of military science and tactics at the
University of Nebraska. He was mustered in as a major of the First
Nebraska Infantry May 9 last and as colonel of the same regiment No
vember 10 1898. lie sailed with his regiment for Manila June 15.
In appearance he was short and slight and had rather an aesthetic coun
tenance, partly perhaps, due to the fact that he was always a very studious
man. He was a strict disciplinarian and the recruits he had to break in
during the early months of his command of the First Nebraska resented
his methods so bitterly that they procured the passage of a resolution of
censure against him through the Nebraska Legislature. Once they be
came engaged in actual warfare, however, the merits of his course became
so apparent that in response, to a very strong demand from the people of the
State and the soldiers themselves, the resolution of censure, by a formal
vote, was expunged from the legislative records.
Colonel John M. Stotsenburg was in command of the First Nebraska
Volunteer Infantry as the result of illness of an officer and the detachment
of another. The First Nebraska went to Manila in command of Colonel
Bratt and under his command took part in the operations south of Manila
against Malate forts and the attack and capture of Manila on August 18.
In the selection of officers for serious positions in the organization of the
government for the city, planned by Major General Merritt . and put into
execution by Major General Otis, Lieutenant Colonel Cotton of the First
Nebraska was made Deputy Collector of the Port. Later Colonel Bratt
became ill and was condemned by a medical board. General Otis ordered
him home and then, as ' - did not care to take Colonel Cotton out of the Cus
tomhouse, where he was doing excellent work, decided to select some other of
ficer for the command of the regiment. Choice fell upon Stotsenburg of the
Sixth Cavalry and he was named. At first there was strong opposition
from within the command, many of the other officers thinking that those In
the regular lines uhcnild be promoted.
Colonel Stotsenburg endeared himself to every man in the regiment and
brought tho command to a high sun.- of efficiency, Lieutenant Colonel

STEAMER CUT IN TWO
IN A COLLISION, YET
NOT A LIFE IS LOST
The City of Kingston and the Glenogle
Crash Together Off Browns
Point.
TACOMA, April 23.â The steam
ships Glenogle and City of Kings
ton came Into collision *svlth a
tremendous crash at 4:30 o'clock
this morning off Browns Point.
The Kingston was struck just back
of her boilers and cut almost
I squarely In two. In ten minutes her
| hull had sunk and her upper works had
j divided into two parts and were drift
! ing about. They were, .subsequently
towed ashore by the Glenogle and tugs.
Nobody was killed, though the escape
of the Kingston's passengers and crew
was nothing less than miraculous.
The Kingston was entering port from
Victoria and the Glenogle leaving for
Victoria, en route to Hongkong.
Browns Point is at the north end of
Tacoma harbor, six miles from the
oceaÂ«n docks. Both steamships were
endeavoring to pass as near the point
as possible. The officers on each were
surprised to see the other steamship so
near in shore. The two vessels whistled
at about the same time, each signaling
to pass.
The Kingston attempted to pass the
Glenogle on the port side, and then,
realizing the certainty of a collision if
the Kingston attempted to get across
the Glenogle's bows, her engines were
reversed.
It was too late to avert the disaster
and the two vessels came together
with a crash. The Glenogle cut the
Kingston in two and the two parts
quickly separated and drifted apart.
The purser and night watchman went
through the Kingston's deck, awaken
ing the sleeping passengers and the
crew.
The firemen poured up out of the fire
room and the engineers escaped quick
ly from the engine-room to the decks,
crowding and jostling against each
other in their excitement . Many of
the crew escaped in only their night
clothes, while those sleeping more
lightly or nearer the deck were able to
seize some clothing. Men and women
I struggled with each other for places in
I the rigging, realizing that the steamer
was sinking.
The officers of the Kingston got out
the lifeboats and the Glenogle's crew
had one of its lifeboats into the water
before the big liner had been stopped.
The sound of the crash and the
shrieking of whistles of the two boats
aroused the crews on the ships in the
harbor. Captain Powles of the ship
James Kerr ordered out a boat and
men to the wreck with First Mate
Hole. The second mate was sent on a
bicycle for a tug, and the tug Victor
put off to the scene.
As the Kingston's passengers were
being taken off, one of the masts top
pled over and fell across . the deck
house, where a number of persons had
congregated, and the frail structure
gave way beneath the weight. Several
of its inmates were slightly injured. A
cabin boy floated off on a piece of
| wreckage and was picked up by the
boats.
Passengers on the Glenogle were
much alarmed and rushed scantily clad
to the deck, ready for a plunge into the
sea. Many of them were unnerved, and
; the ship's stewards plied a lively busi
ness with spirits and wraps. The
shock to the Glenogle was severe and
awoke every one instantly, nearly
throwing them from their berths. The
Chinese crew was excited, and, al
though kept under strict discipline, the
Mongolians chattered and squealed as
though they were mad. The discipline
was almost perfect aboard, and had
the vessel been in danger every one
would have been cared for by the
boats, which were manned also.
A. F. yon Ettllnger of Portland wan
one of the sleeping passengers aboard
the Kingston, His cabin was near the
point where the Glenogle struck the
Victoria liner.
. "As soon as the Kingston was
struck," said Mr, yon Ettlinger, "the
purser and night watchman were
about breaking window lights and
smashing in the doors to awaken the
passengers. Every one was notified of
the danger and ordered to get on deck
as rapidly as possible. The noise of
the crash had awakened most of the
passengers, and they poured out of the
staterooms in various attires. There
was yet time, and most of the passen
j gers were able to put on their clothes."
. The chief engineer of the Kingston
and his first assistant were asleep and
escaped in their night clothes only.
Rev. Horace. ll. Clapham. rector of
Trinity Episcopal Church, occupied the
stateroom : truck by the Glenogle's
prow, and was pinned in the wreck
age for several minutes, being released
only by the parting of the shin. His
forehead was cut slightly. He said:
"My cabin was No. 41, almost ex
actly amidships on the lower tier of
staterooms on the upper deck. I was
awake, looking out of the window, and
saw the Glenogle for fully half a min
ute before the crash. I saw she was
coming straight for us, but felt sure at
i first she would steer away. The next
moment there was a crash, and I was
Imprisoned in a pile of splinters. I was
pinned in fast and struggled hard, but
to no avail. I was certain- then I had
met death at last and resigned myself
to God.
"Then as the ships slewed around an
opening appeared in the debris and I
was freed. I took a piece of board to
pry a way out, and intended to use it
as a life preserver. Reaching the out
â  side, I was standing in the walk be
tween the staterooms and the rail, and
had no trouble clambering aboard the
Glenogle."- ' "
Ren Volkenberk, the captain's "boy,"
.was ' the hero of the collision. He
awoke Captain Anderson by breaking
in his door.
"We're bumped," comically ex
claimed Volkenberg.
â  The captain demanded an explana
tion, but the boy cut* him short with
the exclamation that the Kingston was
sinking.
"Orders, sir," .requested Volkenberg.
"Awake the glory hold," returned
Captain Anderson.
And the "boy" went forward to
arouse the sleeping crew. He returned
and assisted in getting out the passen
gers. A man went overboard and Vol
kenherg saved his life.
T. W. Wright, who w-_~ -.- "ie Kings
ton's deck, tells how her hull went
down as follows:
"Her hull went down like a. shot al
most immediately after the collision,
the masts disappearing below the sur
face like an arrow shot into the water.
People came out in all stages of dress'
and undress and climbed -~ high above
the water as they could. Only one man,
that I saw, jumped overboard, but
three or four were in the water. I
think two women went down In the
hull, but am not sure of it. â  It was
clear enough to see everything plainly
and the trouble seer-- * to be a lack of
caution. The Kingston was not '. ex
pecting the Glenorle and got rattled."
The Glenogle was in charge of Cap
tain Matter of the North American
Mail Steamship Company. The most
plausible theory advanced, after a
study of the stories told, is that the
Kingston was proceeding toward Ta
coma under the <â  impression that the
Glenogle was lying at her dock. When
the Victoria liner rounded the point
and the Glenogle loomed up just ahead
the Kingston's officers were, at least
momentarily, confused.
It is said the Glenogle signaled the
Kingston to pass outsid* and had this
been done/witnesses say, the accident
would not have occurred. The King
ston's officers were probably unable to
distinguish the whistles, and In tho
attempt to pass Inside -ran '.directly
across the bows of the Glenogle. ThÂ«
Glenaglo was probably acting on the
theory that the Kingston would pass
as she had been signaled to do. The re
sult was that both vessel* were headed
fn the same direction, and when the
Kingston's engines were reversed it
brought her directly ahead of the
Glenogle. In another instant the
Kingston had been cut in two as If by
a gigantic knife.
The City of Kingston was built in
Wilmington, Pel., for the Hudson
River trade. She was bought in ISS9
by Captain D. K. Jackson and is now
registered as owned by W. G. Pearse.
She was valued at the time of the acci
dent at $150,000, and was well insured
in foreign companies. She was 146
feet long. 33 feet 5 inches broad and 12
deep. Her net tonnage was 607.96. She
was one of the most commodious and
elegant passenger steamers in the
Northwest, having three decks and
stateroom accommodations for 300 per
sons. She has been on the Tacoma-
Victorla run ever since she was
brought to the sound, and had been
selected as the mail boat to Port
Townsend when the route is re-estab
lished June 1. She carried a crew of
nearly seventy men, all of whom were
accounted for after the collision.
The Glenogle is one of the largest
steamers ever in port. She is iron from
keel to bridge, and this accounts for
her fortunate escape in receiving but
slight damages in the collision. She is
140 feet long, net tonnage 2399. horse
power 700, maximum speed 14 knots.
The great ship made her first trip to
Tacoma in November. The shin had
been in the China-I,ondon and China-
New York trade for fifteen years, and
was famous for carrying the first of
the new crops Tr> market. The crew
numbers seventy-two.
The Glenogle was libeled to-r> ! ~M for
5140.000 by the Northern Pacific Rail
road Company. The ' " Sieges the
collision was caup-d by the careless
ness of the Glenogle's pilot in failing to
make proper signals.
An investigation late this afternoon
after a part of her cargo had been re
moved showed that five or six plates
on the Glenogle's port side were stove
in by the Kingston's guard rail. A por
tion of the rail is sticking out of a great
rent in hor hull, through which the
cargo in her forward hold is visible.
Hut for her collision bulkheads the
Glenogle would have sunk before get
ting ashore. Unloading will continue
all night. By morning her bow will be
sufficiently out of water to show the
exact extent of her injuries. Shipping
men estimate that the cost of her dis
charging, docking and replacing of
plat.s will reach at least $60,000.
In the hold of the Kingston was a
big ram, kept to lead nY "â  of sheep-on
and off. This animal was untied and
swam ashore as the boat was sinking.

ATLANTA, Ga., April 23.â The Constitution -will pay to-mnrrmv:
"The terrible expiation which Sam Hose was forced to pay for his
crime will arouse a flood of discuss inn, carried on by those who- know
the facts on the one side and by those who do not care for facts on the
other. But, while the form of this criminal's punishment cannot be
upheld, let those who are disposed to criticize it look into the facts â and
by these facts temper the judgment they may render.
"An unassuming, industrious and hard-working; farmer, after his
day's toil, sat at his evening meal. Around him sat wife and children,
happy in the presence of the man who was fulfilling to them every duty
imposed by nature. At peace with the world, serving God and loyal to
humanity, they looked forward to the coming day.
"Noiselessly the murderer, with uplifted arm, advanced from the rear
and sank an ax through the brain of the unsuspecting victim. Tearing
the child from the mother's breast he flung it into the pool of blood
oozing from its father's wound. Then began the culmination which has
dethroned the reason of the people of Western Georgia during the past
week. As critics will howl about the lynching the Constitution will be
pardoned for stating the plain facts.

Remember the dark night in the country home. Remember the slain hus

The mob was composed of citizens of
Newnan, Griffin. Palmetto and other
little towns In the country round about
Newnan.
General Atkinson met the mob as ho
was returning from church and ap
pealed to them to let the law take its
course.
A member of the mob was seen to
draw a revolver and take aim at Gen
eral Atkinson, who in speaking said
he would testify against the members
of the mob, but he was disarmed.
Before being put to death the negro
stated that he had been paid $12 by
Lige Strickland, a negro preacher at
Palmetto, to kill Cranford. To-night a
mob of citizens la scouring the country
for Strickland, who has left his home.
Sam Hose killed Alfred Cranford, a
white farmer near Palmetto, and out
raged his wife ten days ago. Since
that time business in that part of the
State has been suspended, the entire
population turning out in an effort to
capture him. He successfully eluded
pursuit until discovered near Macon.
Governor Chandler has been asked to
send troops here to preserve order for
a day or two, as it is feared the negroes
may wreak vengeance, many threats
to that effect having been made.
Hose has been on the farm of Jones
Brothers, between Macon and Colum
bus, since the day after he committed
his horrible crime. His mother is em
ployed on the farm and he fled to her
cabin for refuge. The Jones brothers
were not aware of the crime until a
few days ago and were not sure that
he was the much-wanted man. Sat
urday morning one of the Jones boys
met Hose, and as he was talking ro
him noticed that his â¢â¢ginger" face was
ebony black.
Convinced that V. â  negro had been
blackened to escape detection and that
he was the man for whom the authori
ties had been scouring the country,
they determined to arrest him. This
morning they brought the negro into
Macon ana put him aboard a train
with the intention of bringing him to
Atlanta. At Griffin some one recog
nized Hose and sent word to Xewnan,
the next station, that the negro was on
the train.
When Xewnan was reached a great
crowd surrounded the train and pushed
into the cars. The Jones brothers were
told that the negro could be delivered
to the Sheriff of Campbell County
there and that it was not necessary to
take him to Atlanta. This was acceded
to and he was taken off the train and
marched at the head, of a yelling,
shouting crowd of white people to the
jail.
Here they turned him over to Sheriff
Brown, taking a receipt for the pris
oner, thus making themselves sure of
the $250 reward offered for his arrest.
"Word was sent to Mrs. Cranford at
Palmetto to come to Newnan to make
sure of the identification. In some way
the news of the arrest leaked out and
spread rapidly. From every house in
the little city came the occupants, and
a good-sized crowd was soon gathered
about the jail. Sheriff Brown was im
portuned to give up the prisoner and
finally turned the wretch over to the
waiting crowd. A procession formed
quickly and Hose was marched at its
head to the public square.
The Sheriff informed ex-Governor
Atkinson of Georgia, who lives in New
nan, and he came hurriedly on the
scene, and, standing in a buggy, im
portuned the crowd to let the law take
its course.
"The law will take its course," said
he. "and I promise you it will do bo
quickly and effectively. Do not stain
the honor of the State with a crime
such as you are about to perform."
Judge A. D. Freeman, also of New
nan, spoke in a similar strain. The
assemblage heard the words of the two
speakers in silence, but the instant
their voices had died away shouts of
"On to Palmetto," "Burn him," "Think
of his crime," were heard on all sides
and the march was resumed..
Mrs. Cranford's mother and sister
are residents of Newnan. The mob
was headed in the direction of their
house and in a short time reached
the McElroy home. The negro was
marched in the gate and Mrs. McElroy
called to the front door. She at once
identified Hose, and her verdict was
agreed to by her daughter.
"To the sta: c" was again the cry.
Several men wanted to burn him in
Mrs. McElrpy's yard. To this she ob
j' "â < ted, and the mob, complying with
her wishes. started for Palmetto.
Just as they were leaving Xewnan
word was brought that the 1 o'clock
train from Atlanta was bringing 1000
people to Palmetto. This was thought
to be a regiment of militia, and the
mob at once decided to burn the pris
oner at the first favorable place rather
than be com] lied to shoot .him when
the militia put in an appearance.
The mob, which now numbered near
ly 1500 people, hurried along the road
way. A line of bu Iâles1 â les and vehicles of
all kinds, their drivers fighting for po
sitions in line, followed the procession,
at the head of which, closely guarded,
marched the negro.
One and a half miles out of Newnan
a halt was made. A little to the side
of the road was a strong pine tree and
up to this the negro was marched, his
back placed to the tree and his face
to the crowd, which jostled closely
about him. Here for the first time he
was allowed to talk. He said:
"I am Sam Hose. I killed Alfred
Cranford. but I was paid to do it. Lige
Strickland/ the negro preacher at
Palmetto, gave mo $12 to kill him."
At this a roar went up from the mob.
The intelligence imparted by Hose was
spread among them.
"Let him go on; tell all you know
about It," came from Vhe mob. The
negro, shivering like a leaf, continued
his recital.
"I did not outrage Mrs. Cranford.
Somebody else did that. I can identify
them. Give me time for that."
The mob would hoar no more. The
clothes were torn from the wretch in
an Instant. A heavy chain was pro
duced, wound around the naked body
of the terrified negro and clasped by
a lock at his neck. He said not a word
at this proceeding, but a moment later,
at the sight of half a dozen knives
flashing in the hands of members of
the mob, ho sent up a blood-curdling
yell. In another moment a hand trrasn
ing a knife shot out and one of the
negro's ears dropped Into another's
hand ready to receive it. Hose pleaded
pitifully for mercy and begged his tor
mentors to kill him guie 1 'y. His cries
were unheeded. His other ear was cut
off. Then his fingers, one by one. were
severed from his hands and passed
among the members of the maddened
crowd. The shrieking negro ,was.
quickly relieved of- other portions of hie
anatomy.
. "Come on with the oil." now cried
some one, and almost immediately a
hug" can of kerosene oil was placed at
the foot of the tree where the metro.
his body covered with blood from head
to foot, was striving and tuggine at
his chains. The can was lifted over
the negro's head by three or four men,
and its contents poured over him. By

this time a good supply of brush and
tire wood had been placed about the
aegro'B feet. This pyre was thor
oughly saturated and a match ap
plied. A llame shot up and spread
quickly over the pile of wood. As it
licked the negro's legs he shrieked
once and began tugging at his chains.
As the flames crept higher and the
smoke entered his eyes and mouth.
Hose put the stumps of his hands to
the tree back of him. and with a ter
rific plunge severed the upper portion
of the chains which bound him to the
tree. His body, held to the tree only as
far as the thighs, lunged forward, thus
escaping the llames, which roared and
crackled about his feet. One of the
men nearesi the burning negro auicklv
ran tip. and, pushing him back. said.
"Gel back Into the fire." and auickly
coupled the disjointed links of the
chain.
The road for a distance of a half
mile on each side of the burning negro
was black with people. The crowd sur
rounded the stake on all sides, but
none of those nearer than 100 feet of
the center was able to see what was
going on. Yell after yell went up. The
torch was applied about half-past 2,
and at 3 o'clock the body of Hose was
limp and lifeless, his head hanerinsr to
one side. The body was cut to pieces.
The cr^wd fought for places about the
smoldering tree, and with knives se
cured some pieces of his carcass that
<ii<i not fall to pieces. The chain was
red by hammers, the tree was
chopped d<>wn and such pieces of the
firewood as had not burned were car

GOVERNOR CANDLER
TALKS OF THE LYNCHING
ATLANTA, (la., April 23.â Governor
: randier to-night gave the Associated
Press the following statement on the
; burning of Sam Hose:
"The whole thing is deplorable, and
Hose's crime, the horrid details of
which have not been published, and are
too horrible for publication, is the most
diabolical in the annals of crime. The
negroes of that community Lost the best
â¢t unity they will ever have to ele- |
themselves in. the estimation of
' their white neighbors. The diabolical ;
! nature of the double crime was well ,
! known to every one of them; the per
â  petrator was well kn r -"'i and they-owed
it to their race to exhaust every means
iof bringing Hose to justice. This
' course would have done more to elevate I
i them in the estimation of the good peo
! pie ami to protect their race against
i the mob than all the rewards and proc
lamations of the Governors for the next
fifty years.
"But they lost the opportunity, and
it is a deplorable fact that while scores
of intelligent negroes, leaders of their j
race, have talked to me about the
Palmetto lynching, not one of them j
has ever in the remotest way alluded I
to either tho burning of Palmetto,
which provoked thÂ« lynching, nor to
the diabolical crime of Hose. I do not j
believe these men sympathized with
Hose or the Palmetto incendiaries, but
they are blinded by race prejudice
and can see but one side of the ques
tion. I want to protect them in every
! legal right and against mob violence,
and I stand ready to employ every re
source of the State In doing so, but
they must realize that in order to.
j merit airl receive the protection of the
: community they must show a willing
ness to at least aid in protecting the :
! community against the lav. less element :
i of their own race. To secure protection
against lawless whites they must show
a disposition to protect the white peo
ple against the lawless blacks."
One special and two regular trains
carried nearly 4000 people to Newnan
to witness the burning Of Sam Hose, or
to visit the sce^ne of the affair. The ex
cursionists returning to-night were
loaded down with ghastly reminders of
the affair in the shape of bones, pieces
of flesh and parts of tho wood which
was placed at the negro's feet.
One of the trains, as it passed through
Fort MePherson, four miles out of At
lanta, was stonedâ presumably by no
' groi s. A number of windows were
broken and two passengers were pain
fully injured.
Governor Candler stated during tho
evening that he had been advised that
n mob of citizens from Fayettevlllc and
Woolsey were coming to Atlanta to
take George W. Kerlin from the jail
horo and lynch him. He murderer! Miss
1 Poarl Knott near Woolsey several days
ago and thr^w hor body into the river.
The Governor immediately ordered I
eight companies of the Fifth Tnfantry
(State militia) to be In readiness to
march to the jail upon order. It is bp
lieved. however, that the troops are
held in readiness to be sent to Palmetto
In case of an uprising of negroes there.

AT QUENCUA

perately contested that has oc- !
curred since the fighting with the
Filipinos began.
It is known that the American j
loss was eight men killed and for
ty-three wounded. Colonel John j
M. Stotsenburg, commander of;
the Nebraska Volunteer Regi- j
ment, was shot through the heart â 
immediately after arriving. on the j
battlefield.
Major Bell had taken a party
of sixty-one to reconnoiter the;
enemy's position along the
Quengua River, the object of
the movement being to develop
the strength of the Filipino
forces. The detachment arrived
near Quengua at daybreak. It
continued to advance and drew a
heavy fire.
The cavalry detachment held
its ground until the enemy threw
flanking parties right and left and
almost surrounded the American
force. Then the cavalry drew
back until reinforced, a battalion
of the Nebraska Volunteers
under Major Morford being the
first to arrive. This force being
insufficient to drive the insur
j gents back, the remainder of the
Nebraska Regiment, with the
lowa Volunteer Regiment, was
i hurried forward, and then four
guns of the Utah Battery were
advanced to a fighting position.
Colonel Stotsenburg, com
mander of the Nebraska Regi
ment, arrived on the battlefield at
ii o'clock, having just returned
\ from Manila, where he had been
visiting his wife. He immediate
ly led an advance of the regi
ment, storming the enemy's
trenches, but was shot fatally, dy
ing instantly about two hundred
yards from the breastworks.
The Nebraska Regiment, how
i ever, continued to advance and
beat the insurgents out of their
position. Lieutenant Lester F.
Sisson of the Nebraska Regi
ment was shot through the heart
during the action.
The cavalry lost three men
killed and five wounded.
The loss of the Nebraska Regi
ment was five killed and more
than thirty wounded.
The lowa Regiment's losses
were slight. The heat during the
action was terrific, many pros
trations occurring.
The killing of Colonel Stotsen
burg is greatly deplored, his
reputation as a leader being unri
valed for courage and coolness.
The Nebraska Regiment's losses
during the present hostilities
have been greater than those of
any other regiment.
Several men were sunstruck,
one dying from the effects of the
heat as they lay waiting for the
artillery to come up.
Lieutenant Sisson . fell with a
bullet in his heart, the bullet
striking him near the picture of a
girl suspended by a ribbon from
his neck.
The Americans carried the
second trench with small loss and
are holding the town to-night.
SOLDIERS URGED
NOT TO REENLIST
CHICAGO, April 23.â A Washington!
special to the Inter Ocean says: Secre
tary Alger received from General Otis |
to-night a reply to the cablegram ask- i
ing him for particulars of the receint
by United States soldiers in the Philip
pines of what has been descr'bed by a i
member of the Cabinet as "treasonable !
and seditious communications from j
the United States."
General Otis says in reply to the Sec- j
retary of War that telegrams were sent
to soldiers urging the- - not to re-enlist
and that they were variously signed
â committee" and "the committee," and j
that some bore no signatures at all. \
Secretary Alger has not made public j
the text of General Otis' cablegram, j
and it is, therefore, uncertain whether
the comandmer of the forces in the !
Philippines has confided the names of
the senders of these seditious communi
cations.
General Otis, however, is explicit
enough to confirm the absolute ac
curacy of the Inter Ocean's story, first
published on Saturday morning, ex
posing the work that is being done by
enemies at home of the Government's
policy of subjugatine the Filipinos and j
bringing about peace in the Philip
pines
The cablegram of General Otis to the
Secretary of War is '. n i- the first link
in the chain of r>vi''^ no against the
authors of the treasonable propaganda.
Other proofs will be forthcoming from
time to time until the futile plot is fully I
exposed.
PRESIDENT RECEIVES
NEWS OF THE FIGHT
WASHINGTON, April 23.â Little in
formation came to the authorities from
General Otto to-day respecting the ope
rations i n the vicinity of Quengua, and
while regretting greatly the severe
losses sustained, they were loth to com
ment on it in the absence of fuller in
formation. From what was received it
is evident that the troops engaged in
the fighting were a portion of those
comprised in General Mac Arthur's di
vision, and probably were engaged in
clearing the jungle of bands of insurg
ents infesting it. Much admiration
was expressed for the valor shown by
the Americans under the strong fire of
the insurgents and in face of the un
favorable climatic conditions. The dis
patches were sent to the White House
for tho President's information. Adju
tant General Corbln was with the Presi
dent for a short while during the even
ing, and he was the only official of the
War Department who put in an ap
pearance.

WAR BREWING ON
DEAD MANS ISLE

DECLARES A LEASE ILLEGAL
POLICE FOHCE BACKS UP THE
OITSf'S CONTENTION.
Representatives of Chicago Capital
ists Will Attempt to Take Pos
session Dy Force of
Arms.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VANCOUVER, I*. C, April 2H.â On a
five-acre piece of land commonly
known as Dead-Mans Island, which
guards the entrance to the harbor here,
there promises to be a fierce conflict
between two forces to-night and early
Monday morning. The island was re
cently leased to Stuart & Wells. Chi
cago bankers and capitalists, for a
sawmill site. The lease was disputed
by the Mayor and City Council, on the
ground that the island is an imperial
naval reserve and cannot be leased.
The Dominion Government granted
the lease, and when it was disputed
by this city again looked into the mat
ter, and ratified its former action.
Armed with authority from the
Government, Theodore Ludgate. who
represents the capitalists here, arrived
in the city from Ottawa to take pos
session of the island and erect a mil
lion-dollar sawmill. On Saturday he
said he would take possession on to
morrow, although the city has armed
guards and policemen to prevent him.
Mayor Garden held a hurried confer
ence with some of the Councilors late
last night, and instructed Chief of Po
lice Stewart early this morning to place
the entire police force of twenty-five
men, fully armed, on the island and
prevent. Ludgate landing men there.
Ludgate yesterday engaged fifty robust
laborers, and at midnight managed to
get their tools secretly to the island.
He expressed his Intention to land
these fifty men on the island early to
morrow morning, no matter what op
position might be met. He is a deter
mined man, and as the city is equally
determined that he shall not get pos
session, a conflict seema Inevitable.
The policemen in a body will march to
the island at daybreak. They may be
outwitted, as it was learned from a re
liable source to-night that Ludgate
would land twenty-rive or thirty of his
men after midnight and surprise the
guards.
Ludgate said this afternoon:
"I am authorized by tht.- Government
to take possession of the island, and
will dcfk so, no matter what the < >iit â¢â¢ >-
sition. I do not want to see 'bloodshed,
but I can only say the word 'defeat' Is
not in my vocabulary."
Mayor Garden said: "The police
force will be <Â»n hand 'â ight and early
to prevent Ludgate's men landing. We
have taken the matter into our own
ha mis and will carry " through."
The island is now inhabited by fisher
men, who favor LiUdgate. When they
hi aid of the prospective fight to-day
they got out all of the Â«uns ami 1 1 -
vn lvors in the settlement and loaded
them in readiness to help the capital
ists, who have promised them free rent
on the island for all time. As the mat
ter now stands it is simply the Chi
cago capitalists and the Dominion Gov
ernment against the city.
Several thousand citizens, many in
favor of the mill scheme, will be on
hand to-morrow to see how the affair
turns out.
FATE OF YORKTOWN
PARTY IS IN DOUBT
WASHINGTON, April 23.â From a
dispatch received by Secretary Long
from Admiral Dewey to-day it is evi
dent that the latter is still in the dark
respecting the whereabouts of Lieuten
ant Gillmore and party of the York
town, who, it is thought, were am
bushed and captured by a party of
Filipinos while on a voyage to rescue
Spanish prisoners near Baler. The ad
miral says he is endeavoring to ascer
tain the situation of the lieutenant and
his party. The dispatch is in response
to an inquiry sent by Secretary Long,
not because the latter thought the ad
miral was not making every effort to
rescue the men, but to show the friends
of the prisoners that the department
was not Indifferent to their fate or re
miss in Its endeavors to assist them In
regaining their liberty.
PHILIPPINE REBELS }
AIDED FROM WITHOUT
LONDON, April 24.â The Madrid cor
respondent of the Dally Mail says: A
Spanish prisoner recently released by
the Filipinos says -the insurgents have
50,000 rifles, plenty of ammunition and
200 pieces of artillery, some of them the
latest pattern of quick-firing suns. Ac
cording to his description of the situa
tion they established two large car
tridge factories, and as it is impossible
for the Americans to- blockade such a
coast as that of Luzon the Filipinos
can easily procure from abroad every
thing they require. Tho Informant as
serts that Chinese, European and even
American merchants doing business in
China are helping the Filipinos in this
way.

BANNER YEAR OF

Exports the Largest Ever Re

Exceptionally Small.
WASHINGTON, April 23.â The fiscal;
year of 1898 was the banner year of the !
foreign trade of the United States, our
exports being the largest ever recorded
for a like period and our imports ex
ceptionally small. According to a com
prehensive report just prepared by
Frank H. Hitchcock, chief of the sec
tion of forign markets of the Agri
cultural Department, the total value of
our domestic exports reached the enor
! mous sum of $1,210,291,913, exceeding
the record-breaking figures of the pre
ceding year by $178,284,210. On the
other hand the imports during 1898
were the smallest since 1885, their value
being $616,049,654, a decline of $148,685,
--| 568 of the figures of, 1897. Broadly stated,

SURVIVORS OF THE WHITNEY
THKILLING TALE OF AN OCEAN
DISASTER.
Second Lifeboat of the Foundered
Steamship Rescued After Hav
ing Been Given Up as
Lost.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. AUGUSTINE, April 23.âConsid
erable excitement was created here
early this afternoon by a small boat
out at sea giving signals of distress.
! Captain Allen immediately went to the
assistance in the yacht Baldwin. Upon
nearing the boat he found it to be the
missing lifeboat of the steamer General
Whitney, which foundered north of
Cape Canaveral during Friday night.
Captain Allen transferred the sailors to
his yacht and brought them to Cor
bett's deck, whore a large crowd
awaited them. Hot coffee and food
were given them at once on the boat,
and the poor fellows fairly banaueted.
The story of the disaster, as told by
Mate Mattson and his men, was a
thrilling one. One of the bulkheads
sprang leak from the heavy seas
which were prevaiing during the early
part of Friday night. All hands were
ordered to the pumps and worked hard,
but the holds soon began to fill in sDite
of their efforts. The officers and men.
i realizing that the steamer was settling
fast and certain to founder took to the
two lifeboats, J. W. Haw
| thorne and fifteen men went in the first
I boat and were never seen again by the
| remaining men.
Shortly afterward Mate Mattson and
the balance of the crew, fourteen men.
took to the second boat. That was
about midnight. They obtained a com
pass and began to row for shore. A
| strong wind was prevailing, creating a
i heavy sea, and the men at the oars
i could make no headway.
All day Saturday the men tried to
I reach shore, but could not even get a
glimpse ot it, and almost despaired
when they found they had plenty of
provisions but no water. They spent
all of Saturday night at the mercy of
the seas, which washed over their frail
boat frequently. Early this morning
they sighted land, and with redoubled
energies, made strong by^ desperation,
they took their turns at the oars. When
near tin. -ugh to land they improvised
a flag, which they tacked to an oar,
I and it was then that Captain Allen
went to their rescue.
The men, when they landed, were
drenched to the skin and almost fam
ished. They will await instructions
from Nrw York.
Besides Mate Mattson, who conducted
j the party through the rough trip, the
â  survivors are: Charles Andy, H. Kem
per, D. Jackson, Louis Cook, George
Cook, H. Louis, G. L. Olsen, Ed Sea
blum, Patrick O'Neal, N. Larson, J.
Nelson, George Lingo, J. Davis and
Thomas Ca-vanaugh.
These man were at sea in their open
skiff forty-eight hours and most of the
time without water.

CHINA MAY HAVE
TO BE DISCIPLINED
Attitude of the Government To
ward poreigoers Becoming
iQtolerable.
PEKING, April 23.â The reactionary attitude of the Chinese Gov
ernment toward foreigners is creating for them an intolerable situa
tion which cannot be prolonged.
Promises made by the Tsung LJ Yamen are of no value unless ap
proved by the Grand Council, a ma jorlty of whose members are bit
terly hostile to foreigners and foreign influences. Unless some cnange
takes place soon, it is believed the powers will remonstrate directly
to the Empress Dowager.
As a demonstration of the ignorance of the Grand Council, that
.body has just given its approval to a new invention by the general
commanding the troopj in tl.e province of Pechlli, General Kangsu.
It consists of a sharp, shove -shaped instrument, capable of decapi
tating an enemy at a single blow.
There seems little likelihood that Li Hung Chang will return to
power. â¢
! with our imports, showed an excess of
! $594,242,259, or more than twice the ex
cess for 1597, which was the largest
previously reported.
An Interesting fact developed by the
report of Mr. Hitchcock is the increase
in the exports of agricultural products,
being 70.93 per cent of the total, or
$858,507,942, a gain of nearly*2s per cent
over 1597. Exports of this class also
show a greater gain proportionately
than non-agricultural exports.
our purchases of foreign agricultural
products in 1898 amounted to only
$314,291,796, as compared with $400,871.
--468 In 1897, a decrease of $86,579,672, or
about 22 per cent. The- value of the
American farm products sent abroad
during 1898 was much more thafj^t,
double that of our agricultural im-**
ports, the excess of the former over the
latter amounting to $544,216,146. In
1897 the excess on the side of agri
cultural exports was only $288,883,725,
and in the years immediately preced
ing still smaller.
General Whitney than were contained
in the press dispatches this morning.
The vessel belonged to the Metropolitan
line of New York and the crew was fur
niehed by that company.
Captain J. W. Hawthorne commanded
her pending the completion of the ships
now being constructed for the Morgan
Company at Newport News. He had
been in the employ of the Morgan line
for thirty years and this was the only
vessel he ever lost. The loss of the
General Whitney marks the first disas
ter accompanied by loss of life that has
ever occurred to a boat of the Southern
Pacific or Morgan line.

LOSE COMMAND
OF RALEIGH
CAPTAIN JOSEPH B. COGhjLAN, U. S. N.
I hotograph taken at Hongkong shortly after the battle of
which the Raleigh and her gallant commander bore such
art.)
NEW YORK, April 23.â The Herald's
Washington correspondent sends the
following: As a result of his allusion to
the conduct of the German fleet at
Manila during the war with Spain,
Captain Joseph B. Coghlan will, in all
probability, be relieved of the command
of the Raleigh- Secretary Lone: will
rot discuss Captain Coerhlan's .conduct,
but he consented to say when I saw
him this afternoon that no action
would be taken until he had heard from
that officer. It is presumed that Cap
tain Coghlan received this morning i
the letter sent by Secretary Long yes
terday afternoon, and it Is expected his
reply will be in the hands of the Sec
retary to-morrow or Tuesday.
Until action is taken in the matter it
is hoped by department officials that
Captain Coghlari will not make any
further public utterances of a char
acter reflecting upon the conduct of
Germany during the war. The depart
ment's communication indicates its dis
pleasure that Captain Coghlan .-iiould
I crn himself to make statements
prejudicial to the friendly relations be
tween the United States and foreign"
governments.
In his speech at the Army and Navy
banquet last night Captain Coghlan
said his remarks before the Union
League Club had been garbled, but he
would "not say that they were incor
rect in substance and r.ntrue, but they
were so distorted and twisted as to put
a different r.^.aning on them."
He will, by direction of Secretary
Long, furnish the department with a
correct version of his speech, and his
remarks made last night are, in the
opinion of the department, not apt to
help hir.i out. The Secretary has not
officially noticed the address rr.~ 'â  by
Captain Coghlan last night nor will he
be likely to do so unless he should find
the explanation of the Union League
speech made by the Raleigh's com
mander unsatisfactory. In th?' - â â â -Â«â 
he will probably refer the latter re
marks to Captain . '...in for explana
tion. There is no intention in official
circles of a court-martial of Captain
Coghlan. The utmost that will be
done. If the present temper of the de
partment continues, will be to relieve
him of his command, write him a letter
of censure and note his conduct unon
his record. There 'â¢no C '.i that as
soon as Captain Coghlcr.'fl answer is
received that the steps taken by the
k will be communicated to
the German Embassador with *>. proper
expression of regret at the occurrence.
As the United States was content with
the action of Germany in relieving Vice
Admiral yon Diederichsof his command i
of the Asiatic station, it is presumed
by officials that Germany xvi.. be satis-
ed with th" relieving of Captain Cbgh
lan.

Anonymous Letters and Threats
Have Thoroughly Frightened
the Former Rulers of
the Island.
HAVANA. April 23.â Every now and
again some prominent Spaniard calls
upon Major General Brooke and en
deavors to learn in a more or less dip
lomatic way how long the United
States Government intends to occupy
Cuba. Such a caller usually says that
his stay will be only as long as that
of the American troops.
The same sort of questions are asked
of the United States military authori
ties at the various provincial capitals
and of such civilian Americans as are
supposed to be cognizant of the pur
poses of President McKinley in the
main. The Spaniards are apparently
apprehensive of the future, and pas
sage to Europe by the French and
Spanish liners is being booked three or
fmir months ahead. Last month 6468
persons left Cuba for the United
States, many of whom were Spaniards,
bound ultimately for Spain. In the in
terior districts the Spaniards are kept
in constant discomfort by anonymous
threats.
Charges of dishonesty brought
against certain American civilian pur
chasing aucnts for the Engineering
Department of Havana are now under
inquiry. The complaints are said to
have originated with Spanish dealers,
who allege that they have been invited
to offer bribes.
Sino Caca, a foreman of street clean

some imposition. William P. Moran
was the oldest civil employe in the
Navy Department and cherished the
belief that his thirty-three years'
clerkship in the Secretary's office made
him an invaluahle and Indispensable
part nf the navy. Unfortunately for
Coghlan, Commodore Ammen took the
aggrieved clerk's part and a court
tial resulted. Coghlan was ad
judged guilty of scandalous conduct
and sentenced to suspension for one
year. During this term of enforced
idleness Coghlan took up the study of
law and when in a few months it was
intimated to him that his sentence
wmild be shortened if he would apolo
to Mr. Moran, he declined t" take
any BUCh sh"rt cut to favor, and even
expressed the hope that the clerk
would go to a hotter place than Wash
ington is during th<> summer. Coghlan
lost fourteen numbers in that one year,
and his recent promotion of seven
numbers leaves him still five numbers
Bhort of the place he held in 1876.
In 1889 while in command of the Mo
hican a three-column letter appeared
in the Vallejo Chronicle severely criti
cizing the Steam Engineering Depart
ment of the Navy, showing its lack of
progress in that it was "always one
cylind< r behind the times" In the intro
duction of new engines, and incidental
ly the writer rubbed the fur the wrong
way on numerous persons in the navy.
This letter was signed "J. B. Coghlan,
Commander, U. P. N.," antl it naturally
caused a commotion in Washington.
Chief Engineer TvT^l ville was especially
aggrieved in having his corps charged
with "lagging one cylinder behind,"
and the Navy Department ordered
Coghlan to stand trial by court mar
tial for "conduct to the prejudice of
grind order and naval discipline." The
burden of proof remained with the
court, and as Coghlan would neither
admit nor deny the authorship, and as
the editor of the Vallejo Chronicle was
at this particular time afflicted with a
temporary loss of memory as to what
had appeared in his paper, the court of
course pronounced Coghlan not guilty.
He lost his command, however, and re
mained unemployed until January,
1891, when he was ordered to League
Island. There he again narrowly
escaped being called to account for
talking tOO freely. The timber dock
culvert was smashed to pieces through
the neglect of some official and a Phil
adelphia reporter found Coghlan lo
quacious on the subject: so much so
that an inquiry was held by the Navy
Department, but as it was proved to
the satisfaction of the board of officers
that the reporter had misunderstood
Mr. Coghlan, he got off without a
scratch.

mates of the Burning Sel

SAX RAFAEL. April 23.â Fire
broke out in the Selborn school,
near this city, at o'clock this
morning, and in less than an hour
the beautiful structure was a
mass of smoldering ruins. Thousands
of dollars' .vorth of property was de
stroyed and the life of little Felix Arm
strong was sacrificed, despite the
Ptrenuous efforts of four youthful he
roes to save him. Two oiher children
and a nurse girl narrowly escaped
death in the burning building, and owe
their lives to the same boys, whose no
ble endeavor to rescue the child that
perished proved unavailing.
While th â¢ flames were reddening the
Bky and paintinr the hills, shrubbery
and residences around about a crimson
tint, while they roared and crackled
and filled the air with burning sparks,
which fell on all sides, women rushed
wildly back and forth, sobbing find
screaming and praying a kind Provi
dence to take pity on those who had
not yat made their escape. Strong men
stood V with blan 'ied faces and si
lently watched the kaleidoscopic
changes. The lack of facilities for
fighting fire made it impossible for
them to do anything elsV.
The Selborn school was a private in
stitution for boys, situated a half mile
north of the Hotel Rafael. William
Babcock, one of the directors, was also
virtually its owner, and Rev. Charles
Hitchcock has for the last eighteen
months been employea as principal.
About forty pupils of different ages at

by rushing into the corridor of the
building and shouting at the top of his
lungs. Principal Hitchcock and wife
slept on the lower floor, there being
three stories to the structure, and were
instantly awakened by the alarm.
Hastily donning their garments they
rushed out into the corridor, to find

MISSOURI RIVER
RISING STEADILY
Above the Danger Line
at Omaha.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
OMAHA, April 23.â The Missouri
River has continued to rise steadily
during the past twenty-four hours and
is now above the danger line. At the
foot of Farnam street, where the big
Omaha and Grant smell is located,
the water is within about two inches
of the top of the bank and any addi
tional rise will inflict great damage on
the smelter property. The Union Pa
cific tracks are partially u-der water.
The river is a roaring torrent and
filled with all kinds of debris. Below
the Union Pacific bridge 't is three
miles wide and the Burlineton tracks
are lapped by the waves. The current
that has set in from Florence Lake
The flames were seen in the heart
of the city by Night Watchmen Peter
O'Brien and Jacob Miller, who sounded
i the alarm by ringing the bell at the
I fire engine house, and Id a short time
! the fire department and three-fourths
of the population of the town were
rushing to the scene. Owing to the
distance and the fact that water had to
be conducted through 2000 feet of hose,
the department was unable to render
any assistance beyond keeping the
flames from spreading to the adjoining
buildings.
Just as the flames began to leap
through the roof, Mrs. Hitchcock, who
had been rushing frantically around in
Bearch of her two little children, Mer
vyn and Ida. caught sight of them in a
dormer window of the upper story.
They had been in charge of a. nurse
girl named Margaret Bloomfield, and,
when they made their appearance at
the window, wore clinging to her and
sobbing in their fright. The screams
of the mother soon drew the crowd to
the front of the building and every
body began to cry for some one to
fetch a ladder.
At this exciting juncture William
and Rudolph Lichtenberg, youthful
sons of William C. Lichtenberg, the
San Francisco commission .merchant,
who lives near the site of the school,
appeared, dragging a heavy ladder,
and shouts of encouragement arose
from the crowd. They were quickly
changed to cries of horror when the
ladder was found to be too short by
ten feet. Losing no time, the boys
placed it in as advn 'Tgeous a position
as possible and William Lichtenberg
ran to the top. He was followed by
Hugh Walker, the son of a lady who
conducts a lodging house at San Ra
fael.
The boys shouted their instructions
to the nurse, who took the children by
the wrists, one at a time, and lowered
them to Lichtenberer. who caught
them by the ankles and, letting them
swing clear of his support, lowered
them headfirst to Walker. He in turn
handed them to Rudolph Lichtenberg,
whose position was near the foot of
the ladder. When the children were
placed safe in her arms the anxious
mother was in a fainting condition, but
soon recovered.
As soon as the children were safe the
problem confronting the boys was how
to effect the rescue of the nurse, which
promised to be no simple matter. The
girl remained cool and courageous, al
though the heat from the flames creep
ing along the roof was fast becoming
unbearable. At William Lichtenben;s
command she clambered out of the
window, and, hanging from the sill,
southward is very strong amr n an addi
tional rise means a pro' -ble shifting
nt the river channel. During the night
twenty families were driven out. The
bottoms are now completely covered.
Reports from up the river show that
the water is faHilng, but the rise here
is likely to continue another twenty
four hours.
KANSAS --iV Mo., April 23.â The
Missouri River at 7 o'clock this even
ing had reached three inches above
danger line and was still rising to
night. The current is exceeedingly
strung, and serious damage to property
in the lowlands may result. Men wore
kept busy to-day driving the squat
ters to higher ground, and farmers and
others spent the day in moving th-Mr
pioperty and belongings to safe places.
The only real damage that has resulted
so far has been the flooding cf several
cellars of business houses on the river
here. Gangs of men were working
steadily all day pumping out water
and removing goods. It is believed the
Tiv>T will reach its height to-morrow

Shafter Returning Westward.
DENVER, April 23.â General William R.
Shafter stopped herevthis evening, en
route to San Francisco. He took dinner
with Cioneral H. C. Merriam and left at

Grande.
David Quinn a Murderer.
SACRAMENTO, April 23.â Pierce Surge
son, the young man who on Friday last
was shot over a game of cards by David
dropped into his arms. The distance
was only a few feet, but the brave boy
had to hold on with one hand and
catch the with the other. He was
nearly overbalanced by the shock, but
recovered himself and the two reached
the ground uninjuced.
It was about this time that little
Felix Armstrong was missed. The fire
had now communicated itself to the ad
joining gymnasium and any attempt at
rescue would place the rescuers be
tween two fires, but the boys hesitated
not an instant. As soon as they leorn
-led the location of the little fellow's
room on the second floor they hoisted
their ladder, and, headed by Fred Hof
: fnr, cl-imbtred up with the "intention of
i entering the room, but it wai too late.
As they reached the window the flames
burst forth from the room, singeing the
hair and scorching the faces of the
foremost lad. Reluctantly they were
compelled to return to the ground.
They had hardly withdrawn to a place
of safety when the roof fell in and the
two buildings became one mass of fire.
When the flames had exhausted
themselves sufficiently for water in
buckets to be thrown upon the ruins,
the firemen, searching under the direc
tion of Chief Johansen, found the
charred and unrecognisable remains of
the little lad still reclining upon his
iron bedstead. It is probable that
death was caused by painless suffoca
tion from the smoke and fumes before
the flames touched him. The remains
were taken to the Morgue by Coroner
Eden and an inquest will be held to
morrow morning.
Little Felix was the only child of
Captain Richard F. Armstrong of the
First California Volunteers, who re
signed bis position with Shreve & Co. to
go to Manila in behalf of his country.
The mother died some time ago. While
the brave soldier is perhaps dreaming
of the day when his feet will once
more tread the soil of his native land
and his heart be gladdened by the sight
And caresses of his little one, the child
lies lifeless on a bare slab in the
Morgue. One soldier's home-co^;rn;
will be a sad one, indeed â for him
there is only a little mound of earth
with its marble henrWono.
The total loss by the fire is estimated
at nearly $40,000. the insurance being
$20,000. In addition to the loss of the
buildings, with all their appurtenances,
many valuable manuscripts belonging
to Octavius Hates, the late principal,
perished in the flames. Part of the fur
niture and othfr fixutres were saved
by the citizens who were the first to
reach the spot after the alarm was
sounded. Tho --'~ ! n of the fire is a
mystery, although the insurance agents
think it was caused by a defective flue.
Principal Hitchcock and his wife
luckily moved their quarters from the
upper to the lower floor two days be
fore the fire. In describing the scenes
occurring during the excitement, Mr.
Hitchcock said two of the instructors.

LOS ANGELES, April 23.â Hon.

a crisis has been reached in the fail

result of this situation will eventually
be, he thinks, a constitutional amend

by a direct vote of the people.
"Matthew Quay of Pennsylvania has
little prospect of ultimately retaining
his seat in the United States Senate,"
said Mr. Eckels. "The action of Gov

THRONGS OF NATIVE
SONS AND DAUGHTERS
ARRIVE AT SALINAS
Hospitality of the City Extended
to the Many Stranger
Guests.
SALINAS, April 23. â Lowering
clouds marked the dawn of this,
the all-important day of the year
for Salinasâ day on which the
delegates to the Grand Parlor,
Native Sons of the Golden West,
arrived for their week of high jink?, in
terspersed with work. At S o'clock this
morning Jupiter Pluvius reminded the
people that he was still doing business
at the old stand by sending a light
shower down upon the city and its gay
decorations. Universal gloom settled
down upon countenances that only 1; si
night were beaming, for while as a
usual thing. Salinasites gladly welcome
anything in the shape of rain, this time
they felt aggrieved at its appearance
and were indignant that so little re
spect was shown to the beauties of the
city's gala tire.
In a short time. hov.cvor. old Sol took
charge of things nee more and held .
the center of the stage during the re
mainder of the day. Jupiter Pluvius re
mained fractious, continuing to send
threatening clouds and all kinds of
ominous signs just to keep the people
alarmed. .
When the Bun made its triumphant
entry into the heavens two rainbows
could be seen, one ceiestial and the
other terrestrial, the latter running up
and down and hither an I thither until
all the city was full of its brilliance.
Bright colors deck public buildings,
business houses and private resi
dences in all parts of the city. Indeed,
the few places that are not decorated
have so lonesome and forlorn an
nspect that an involuntary feeling of
sympathy is occasioned thereby. The j
great banner of America waves in ;
triumph from housetops and building
fronts. The golden yellow of the Na
tive Sons is everywhere mingled with
the red, white and blue of the republic
and the red and white of the golden
commonwealth. Color and brightness
delight the eye at every turn. The
California bear and the miner of '49 of j
The days of old.
The days of gold.
The days of 49.
Are prominent features of nearly all I
decorations, while "the man with the
Foap," who does imitation frosting on
glass has produced some very artistic |
effects on the big plate-glass windows
>f business houses and hotels.
Some of the most artistically bedeck
-d houses are those of W. H. Py
burn, Hon. Jesse D. Carr, Mrs. M. E.
Cook J. J. Wyatt, W. R. Johnson, B.
V. Sargent, F. B. Day. S. F. Geil, C.
Rieghold and A. L. Luce. Japanese ]
lanterns, that so readily lend them
selves to artistic effects, are prominent
features in these decorations. When
lighted at night the effect was pictur
esque.
Such was the sight that met the eyes
of the Natives who came to-day, many
of them for the first time, to this beau
tiful and prosperous city of the great
Salinas Valleyâ the city whose well
nigh inexhaustible resources are just
coming to be adequately known to in- ,
State at large. Salinas first attracted |
attention because of being the center
,f the beet-sugar Industr" and the site
of Claus Spreckels' great sugar factory,
now nearly completed, but once known
It has made great strides into promi
nence and popularity, and is to-day the
most enterprising and progressive city
of its size In California. An evidence
of this is the present royal entertain
ment it is offering to many hundred
visitors from all parts of the State. A
city of only 5000 population that can of
fer not only acceptable but brilliant
entertainment to nearly 2000 guests for
an entire week, is certainly one that
will quickly make its mark in the his
tory of the State.
Santa Lucia Parlor, the Salinas or
ganization, that has worked so un
tiringly for the pleasing entertainment
of the grand officers, delegates and
visitors who arrived to-day, is a fine
example of Salinas grit. One of the
youngest parlors of the Stateâ having
been organized ten years â and with
the prospects of the worst year,
financially, in the history of the State
staring it in the face at that time, it
Bent delegates to last year's Grand Par
lor with instructions to capture the
Grand Parlor for the present â¢ session.
This the delegates did to the entire
satisfaction of all, and certatinly the
order never met a more hearty welcome
and sincere hospitality than that ac
corded it here. The local parlor has
ninety members, many of whom figure
prominently in county affairs. Among
these are: H. R. Farley, County Sheriff;
James Taylor, County . Treasurer;
Elmer P. Alexander, Tax Collector;
Lou G. Hare, County Surveyor; W. J.
Irvine, chairman of the Board of
County Supervisors; F. W. Sargent,
Deputy County Clerk, and DA. Porter,
Deputy County Surveyor.
Some of the past presidents of the
parlor are: J. J. Nowlin, T. J. Rlordan,
R. E. Keney, W. M. Vanderhurst, John
J. Wyatt, W. J. Irvine, John L.
Mathews, the celebrated ex-Sheriff; N.
G. Wyatt, C. F. Lacey, T. B. Johnson.
W. T. Duncan. B. V. Sargent, W. W.
Zabala, M. C. Clark, J. A. Anderson, E.
J. Harris, DA. Porter and E. Dough
erty, nearly all of whom are leading
men in city and county affairs.
With its smile of welcome and its glad
hand extended Santa Lucia Parlor, and,
In fact, all Salinas, met the 1:39 p. m.'
train to-day and took possession of the
arriving delegates. Native Sons crowd
fd seats, aisles and platforms upon the
train, even invading the baggage-car
There were nine cars, orawn by two en
gines. The high jinks begun by Stan
ford Parlor in San Francisco last night
appear to be still on to-day. The natives
poured off the train more like a crowd of
rollege men 'at a rush than a company
of staid and dignified jurists, legislators
and capitalists, whose brains, deeds and
g-old have done bo much to make their
r.atlve State as great as it is to-day
The din produced by the simultaneous
ictlon of two brass bands playing dlffcr
ant airs, the shouts of greeting and the
aughter of several hundred strong
iunged men, the cheering of the waiting
crowd, the noise of the train bell and
escaping steam and rattle of the carsâ
with pandemonium such as this the
3rand Parlor made its initial entrance
into Salinas.
Troop C of the National Guard of Pall
Pears'

ing but soap.

tle as oil to the living

fornia, 100 strong, in full uniform and
commanded by Captain M. C. Burke, and
about eighty-five members of Santa Lucia
Parlor, accompanied by C troop's '^nd ar
rayed in the regulation army blouse and
white duck trousers, marched to the de
pot. The reception committee boarded the
train, and, emerging with nearly 700 dele- .
gates, their relatives and friends, mar- ;
Bhaled them into line and commenced
their slow progress up Castrovtlle and
Main streets to Armory Hall, where hand
shaking was the order of the hour. The
procession was headed by the Troop c
band. Troop C followed, acting as a
guard of honor to the reception commit
toe and the grand officers of the Grand
Parlor. Next came Santa Lucia Parlor
and one body of delegates. The Fifth
Regiment band of San Jose, preceded by
D. A. Porter, chairman of the committee
on music, was followed by the remainder
of the delegates, while citizens of Salinas
in carriages and on foot completed the
procession.
Of course, the Ã¼biquitous kodak fiend is
here. Large numbers of him and many
kodaks were visible In the procession.
That portion of the population of
Salinas not at the station awaited the
delegates along Main street, and men,
women and children surged up and down
that street from end to end. Fully 3000
people were in a space of a few blocks
of this one street alone.
The informal reception at the armory
was presided over by the executive com
mittee of Santa Lucia Parlor. The execu
tive committee has established its head
quarters at No. 211 Main street, and the
: ration bureau also is at th.s place.
The secretary of the committee or one of
his assistants will always be on .nnd for
the convenience of visitors ana to take
charge of all mail and telegrams not other
wise addressed. The headquarters are pro
fusely decorated with gold, and red, wnlte
and blue bunting. Rags and o'her appro
priate emblems. Carriages a id busses will
always stand in front of these headquar
ters in readiness to take visitors abnut the
city and to points of Interest, each vehi
cle driven by some one acquainted with
Salinas and its surroundings.
The promenade concert was this after
noon's chief event. The music was sup
plied by Conterno's Fifth Regiment band
from San Jose. The band was stationed
in the newly erected stand on Main
street. In respect to the day its pro
gramme consisted chiefly of sacred selec
tions.
An immense crowd thronged the streets
all afternoon and up to a late hour to
night. Although it was Sunday, shop win
dows were bright with illumination and
the electric street lights mingled with the
more subdued colors of thousands of Jap
anese lanterns to excellent advantage. \
These long lines of lanterns are proving [
wonderfully effective features of the
street decorations. Many ladies were in
the throng and their dainty gowns and
hats added not a little to the beauty of
the scene. The excellent open-^ir concert
rendered by the Salinas City band closed
the day's programme.
Most of the remaining delegates will ar
rive here to-morrow, although some will
be detained till Tuesday. Two entire par
lors of Native Daughters, from Watson
ville and Hollister, will arrive to-morrow
and representative- of ,man v other Native
Daughters' organizations of the State will
grace the occasion with their presence.

gates have thus far registered at the ex

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1899.
OLDEST ADMIRAL IS
NINETY-FOUR TO-DAY
REAR ADMIRAL THOMAS O. SELFRIDGE, U. S. N.
WASHINGTON, April 23.â Rear Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge St., U.
S. N., retired, will celebrate his 94th birthday to-morrow. He
was born in Massachusetts, appointed to the navy from that State
on January 1, IMS. at the age of 12 years 9 months, and has now been
eighty-one years three months and twenty-three days in the service. Dur
ing his earlier days he made some voyages in merchant vessels, as our
navy was considerably reduced in ships for many years after the war of
ISI2, and there was but scant employment for the officers. He took an
active part in the Mexican War and was severely wounded in the treach
erous attack by the Mexicans at Gugamas, necessitating his return to
the East. AYhen the Rebellion broke out Commodore Selfridge was too
fur advanced ln years to accept active duty at sea, and he was assigned
as Commandant of the Mare Island Navy Yard 1562-4 and again in 1573.
In the latter year all retired officers were withdrawn from active service,
and hi has eve:- since resided at Georgetown, D. C, but for many years
has paid an annual visit to San Francisco, where he has two sons residing.
R r Admiral Selfridge is probably the oldest living officer of that
rank in any navy in the world, and there is no navy which has two Ad
mirals, father and son, both retired. Rear Admiral Thomas O. Selfridge
Jr. was born February' 6, 1836, joined the navy at the age of 15 and retired
last j-ear. The second eldest son is Commander James Russell Selfridge,
born July 11, LS49, and in the navy since 18G4. He is likely to become a
Real- Admiral In about ten years.
The father of the navy and the senior Rear Admiral enjoys good health,
due in a large measure to his simple mode of life and correct habits. He
Is mentally as active as he was thirty years ago, and takes a lively in
terest in the affairs of that navy with whose fortunes, rise and progress
the old sea veteran has been prominently identified.

JOAN OF ARC TO
BE HIS THEME
Archbishop Ireland Will
Talk at Orleans.
CELEBRATION ON MAY 8
MEMORY OF THE GIRL SAINT TO
BE HONORED.
Diplomatic Circles Interested in the
Differences Between Italy and
the Vatican as to the
Peace Congress.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 23.â The
presence of Archbishop Ireland in Eu
rope t this time led to the efforts
among leading members of the diplo
matic corps here to have the eminent
American divine pn side at some not
able church occasion. As a result, it
Is learned that the Archbishop will de
liver the principal discourse at the
Joan of Arc celebration on May 8 at
the old French town of Orleans, which
gave the name of the "Maid of Or
ieans" to the, girl saint and soldier.
The exercises will have both a re
ligious and a national character, bring
ing pilgrimages from all parts of Eu
rope and Laving the special benedic
tion of the Pope.
It was thought at first Archbishop
Ireland would take this occasion to
correct the misapprehensions which
have arisen through Europe as to
"Americanism," as set forth in Father
Jie< ker's book. The errors on this sub
ject are ascribed mainly to the mis
translation of the book by a French
abbe, so that it was felt to be appro
priate that the correction and elucida
tion of true "Americanism" should be
made on this memorable church and
national occasion. Quite recently,
however, the leading church authori
ties in this country have made known j
that Archbishop Ireland's discourse |
would be confined strictly to religious
themes, dealing with the inspired char
acter of Joan of Arc. While this may
not give the discourse the significance
at first expected, yet the belief is ex
pressed by those familiar with the ar
rangements that the fervor and pa- \
triotic impulses of Archbishop Ireland j
may lead to some discussion of the
American theme which has been so
prominent in church affairs of late and
in which he has been one of the fore
most figures.
Catholic church affairs also have
been attracting the attention of diplo
mat! circles of late, in connection
with the attitude of Italy in refusing
to take part in the Czar's disarma
ment congress if the Pope also was to
take part. Because of this controversy ;
the invitations issued by the Govern
ment at The Hague were delayed some
weeks, and, in consequence, the Brit
ish Foreign Office withheld the official
announcement of Sir Julian Paunce
fote'a selection one of the British
delegates. The State Department also j
was in the same quandary until the
controvert- was adjusted. As ex
plained by a leading diplomatic official,
the position of Italy was similar to
that tal n wh n the temporal power
of the .Pope was denied and finally
overthrown. In opposing the Pope's
representation at The Hague, Italy
held that the sole authority of the
Vatican related to moral and social af
fairs and not material or political
questions between nations.
In behalf of the Pope it was urged
that Italy already recognized the ma
terial and political authority of the |
Pope by admitting the appointment of
Embassadors to the Vatican from
Franco, Spain. Bulgaria, Portugal and
some other countries.
Pending the settlement of Italy's ob
jections, there was much perplexing
delay in arranging the details of the
congress. It was finally determined
that the Pope should not be represent
ed, this - vision, it is understood, be
ing aequiesc. in by the Vatican.
Since then thÂ°re have been intimations
that the French delegates to The
Hasrue would indirectly represent the
Vatican, but It is said in the best
posted diplomatic quarters that this
sunr'â is wholly unwarranted.
MRS. ANNA BOND'S
HANDY UMBRELLA
She Uses It Vigorously on Her Form
er Husband and Her
/ Sister.
9AN RAFAEL. April 23.â Dr. Freder
ick T. Bond, the metropolitan physician,
and his sister-in-law, Miss Emma Nich
ols, who lives with her mother at 170-
Shipley street, were savagely assaulted
on the corner of Fourth and B streets
to-day by the physician's divorced wife,
Mrs. Anna Bond, who was nrmed with
an umbrella. She accused him of having
kidnaped her child and kept it away
from her, and said her sister wns the
cause of all the domestic troul Ie she had
undergone. The woman was arrested on
a charge of battery and released on her
own recognizance by Recorder Gardner
The troubles of the Bonds were aired In
Judge 'Promt's court in San Francisco
last October, the husband suing his wife
for a divorce on the ground of cruelty.
He was allowed the custody of their little
girl, with the understanding that the
mother might visit tin- child as often as
she stfw fit. Since then the little one has
been with the parents of Dr. Bond in
Vallejo. â â¢
Mrs. Bond met her husband and sister
on the street In San Francisco to-day
and. thinking they would go to Vallejo,
followed them here. Siie asked on the
train that her child be returned to her
and received an evasive answer. When
the two reached town Mrs. Bond stopped
them and began to abuse them. She call
ed her husband a villain, and her sister
was referred to in uncomplimenary terms
Her language was resented, and she be
gan to belabor them with her umbrella

PREFERS SUICIDE

Mrs. George Threatens
to Kill Herself.
AWAITS THE JURY'S VERDICT
SAYS IT WILL MEAN LIFE OR
DEATH TO HEi< A
Declares She Shall Never Go to the
Penitentiary if Convicted of
the Murder of George D.
baxton.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 23.â A Canton,
0., special to the Herald says:
"Should the jury render a verdict
against me I will never po to the pen
itentiary. I will accept suicide" as a
last means of escaping the persecution
that has been mine for ten years."
Such is the declaration said to have
been made by Mrs. Annie E. George,
whose trial for the murder of George
D. Saxton is now drawing to a close.
My informant is Mrs. Streeter, who
has supported Mrs. George during the
last three weeks as if she were her sis
ter, and it was to Mrs. Streeter the
declaration was made.
"Mrs. George is a determined
woman," Mrs. Streeter said to me,
"and I believe she would prefer death
to conviction and a term of years in
the penitentiary to follow it. At times
she is of buoyant spirits and again she
is greatly depressed. She feels that
Judge Taylor has been fair in all his
rulings, and should the jury convict
her she would have little hope of relief
from an appeal. She has told me sev
eral times she would kill herself if
convicted, and # l believe she would. I
would hot blame her."
Sheriff Zaiser does not believe Mrs.
George will make good her promise of
self-destruction in the event of defeat
in court, but he told me to-day he
would take no chances, and if the
woman were convicted she would be
placed under close surveillance while
she was in his charge.

DEMOCRATS PREPARE
FOR FACTIONAL WAR
Plan to Disband the Committee of
One Hundred.
Phelan's Followers Scheme to Hold Control by Cbeat=
ing the Primary Lawâ Rival Candidates
for Mayor State Committee
Involved.
LOCAL Democrats have begun their
iratory work for the cam
i which will end in November
with the first election under th<=" char-
The faithful followers of the Gal
lagher-Maguires have hardly recovered
from the crushing defeat which they
suffered at the last election, but they
are active and eager in the field with
a firm purpose to fight each other that,
with the scars of internal warfare,
th^y may better oppose their common
y. The factional quarrels which
have dopp so much to make Demo
cratic politics spectacular have com
menced in earnest.
Mayor Phelan will be the bone of
contention, and his success or failure
in F^curing the Democratic nomination
for May.r will mark the gr^at issue of
the lr,ral campaign. Savage political
- are even now hHng aimed at the
ed and much-cartooned he:
"His H.mor," and if dark political
ai for anything that Interest
ing topplece will be severely battered
re th" fight is over. Those that
pposed to thÂ»- Mayor will Beck in

Committee of one Hundred through
'.he intervention of the Democratic
I , â  . . ;. .
â  'â â â â  - heme will leave the
open for a complete reorganiza
of the municipal Democracy in a
manner that will relegate I'helan .^nd
political elements he represents to
private life. In this fight the state
tral Committee will be the judge.
The second contest is utterly depend
ent upon the first. If the opponents of
Phelan fail to destroy the Committ'-e
â¢ Hundred it will be idle to block
trx* progress of the Mayor except in an
il :â â¢ the courts. If th<- Committee
of One Hundred is permitted to exist
it will strive to destroy district opposi
tion that in all probability would be
- sful. This scheme has been ,
rated with cleverness. The fol
lowers of Phelan Will attempt to have
all th( tes to the municipal .--on- ;
for by local Democrats

'jg their own district delegates,

city will vote for all the delegates to I

The first fight, which will determine I
â iy existence of the Committee
Hundred, will he fought the
I bis week or early next :
â â " r -k. Seth Mann, the chairman of the
the Democratic
CentraJ Committee, says that a
ag of the body of which" h* is the
head will be called very soon to deter- '
mine an appeal taken by W. J. Heeney,
ember of the local Committee of
Hundred. In the early stages of
ihe last campaign Heeney becam* dis
gusted with tli" dominating Influence
of the Phelanites in the committee. It
will be remembered that the State Cen- '
tral Committee nearly two years ago
grabbed both local Democratic factions
by the neck, bumped their heads to
gether and told them to go home. Both
â¢izstions were disbanded and a!
nlttefl of nine, representing the ;
State Central Committee, selected one
hundred men to organize a new local
I Â»â¢â¢ mocracy.
These hundred men declared them- I
i a committee of one hundred i
and arrogated to themselves all the â 
power and authority of the local or
ganization. They made themselves a
County Committee, and then, to carry i
the farce further, declared themselves
a municipal convention. They were
frank to confess that they did not dare
submit themselves to their party at a
primary, as they would have been hope
lessly beaten. So desperate was their
â tnd. bo meager their supporters
that they were forced even to take sev
eral of their municipal nominees from
their own ranks.
It was against this plan of organiza
tion and subsequent policy that Heeney
appealed. He declared that the Com
mittee of One Hundred had usurped
power which did not belong to it. H< e
ney Insisted that the Committee of
One Hundred had been chosen simply
to cr.-at.- a County Committee and to
do nothing else. The Committee of
( Â»ne Hundred, therefore, says Heeney,
is an illegal body under Democratic
laws.
The appeal has remained forgotten
since it was made, but now the oppo
nents of Phelan see in it a handle with
whi<-h to wield an ax of destruction
upf-n the local organization. Since the
failure of the last campaign, however,
a new factional spirit has arisen in the
State Central Committee. It is under
stood that Seth Mann Is not as friendly
to the Phelanites as he might he, or at
all events he is willing, with his asso
ciates--, to discuss and consider the Hee
ney appeal. A meeting of the execu
tive committee of the state Central
Committee will therefore be called.
The decision of this body on the ap
peal will not be final. Whatever the
outcome is, the matter must be re
ferred to the State Central Commit
tee for settlement. The action of this
committee will be watched with in
terest. It will be remembered that the
organization of the Committee of One
Hundred was indorsed by the State
Central Committee, which has not,
however, officially declared the Com
mittee of One Hundred to be a county
committee. Wheth r it is or not will
mean much to the political ambition
of James I). Phelan.
If thf> Committee of One Hundred is
disbanded by the State Central Com
mittee and a new organization is or
dered there is not the slightest ques
tion that Phelan will be forced to run
as an independent candidate for May
or if he wishes to succeed himself. The
men that are schr-mi.ig to undo the
Committee of One Hundred are al
feady suggesting possible candidates
for Mayor. Among the names is that
of Robert Y. Hayne, who, however,
has not a city residence. This is very
easy to acquire. Among the others is
John Rosenfeld, and there will be
many more before the fight is won or
lost. The shadow of Colonel Jim
Smith has fallen even from the Phil
ippines across the path of the Mayor.
If th* 1 opponents of the Committee of
One Hundred fail to oust that interest
ing body a new battle will have to be
planned. Already the battle lines are
being fixed and the forces organized.
Chris Buckley thinks he has a chance
to turn right side up in the scramble,
and for some time he has been laying
his plans. He began In a modest way
with the carriage shop of O. F. Willey
for a headquarters. Then he moved
to a saloon on Bush and Montgomery
streets, where the surroundings are
reminiscent and congenial. This ren
dezvous became inadequate, and a
third headquarters was established at
a new resort on O'Farrell and Powell
streets. There Buckley talks to all who
want to talk to him. Ralney is skir

his advice. Ex-Gnvernor Budd. Maior
Harney, M. F. Tarpey and W. C.
Graves are also displaying a most
marked interest in local Democratic
i affairs and looking for an opportuity
[ to place a wedge.
The Phelanites are not by any means
| ignorant of this fact. They know that
In ;i legitimate primary election they
would meet with overwhelming: defeat.
i They did not dare to submit their
j claims to their fellow Democrats before
the last election, and with the Btigma
! of unfairness and a disastrous defeat
i upon them they would hardly be a fac
tor at a primary election. So Gavin
McNab, Sam Braunhart, Max Popper
ffnd others have devised the first
scheme to destroy the intended effect
of the Stratton primary law. These
men have clamored loud and lons for
a pure primary. They have shouted
every shibboleth known to the politi
cian to decry and condemn the in
fluence of saloon politcs, criminal
bosses and th*=> "push."
Yet these very men are th" first to
attempt to defeat the purpose of a
primary law. Their plan has been out
lined. Without a hope of winning in
a majority of the districts they "want
to elect district delegates by a vote of
ail thf Democrats in the city. The
Phelanites are clinging to a forlorn
hope that in pome few of the districts
they ma'- Pile up enouph votes to over
balance the vote cast in other districts,
and thus defeat their opponents by a
practical fraud upon the Stratton pri
mary law. Braunhart has already
sought the advice of Senator Stratton
in reference to the Bcheme and its le
galitiy.

MANILA IS ALL RIGHT.
Official Reports Show That the Cli
mate Is of the Best.
The Chamber of Commerce is in re
:elpt of some advance sheets of United
States consular reports, and one from
Consul O. F. Williams at. Manila is of
particular interest at this time, as it
deals with the climate of the Philippines.
There has been much concern in this
State, and in fact all over the country,
about the health of the soldiers now at
the front fighting the Filipinos, and many
statements have been made leading to
the belief that the climate of the islands
is such that but few white men can
live there and perform any kind of la
bor. The report of Consul Williams was
made on February 24, and it will no
doubt bring relief to the minds of thou
sands who have relatives and friends In
the new territory. Consul Williams says:
"I wish to refute the statements gen
erally circulated in regard to the health
and climate of the Philippine Islands.
Being within the tropics they of course
lack the invigorating effects of frost,
and the temperature averages highâ at
Manila about 75.3 degrees Fahrenheit; but |
extremes are not wide apart, and during
the last year I heard of no temperature
below 57 degrees Fahrenheit In the isl
ands, and none below the sixties in Ma
nila. Mercury in the shade rarely rises
above 85 degrees, nor above 95 degrees in
the sun.
"Being on the coast of a bay so large
as to be almost an inland sea, and hav
ing eight miles to the east a lake of 100
miles of shore, whose waters seek the
bay through the large and rapid Pasig,
the city of Manila has fresh air con- i
stantly, as well as sea breezes.
"The sewers of Manila are not good,
and never can be made first class, be
cause of its low level; but the rainfall '
here is above 10 feet per annum and quite
evenly distributed, so that the streets are
rain swept and the sewers well flushed
almost every day. There is also an ad
vantage in the hot, wet weather, which
hastens the decay of vegetable or animal
matter, this soon rotting and being
washed away.
"The city water supply is abundant.
The water is carried in large iron pipes
about seven miles from springs, and is
exceptionally pure and agreeable to the
taste. I use it every day as a beverage,
and have never experienced any ill effects
therefrom.' I have not been sick a min
ute since I left the United States, In
1897. ' .
"In filthy quarters smallpox may be
found almost any day: but few deaths
result, and the sanitary measures of the
present government have been of bene
fit. The death rate is small, and it is
only necessary to live properly to be en
tirely healthy."

GOVERNOR GAGE
AND W. F. HERRIN
IN CONFERENCE
Secret Meeting at the
Palace.
PUBLIC BUSINESS DISCUSSED
TAKING UP THE BURDEN OF
STATE AFFAIRS.
At the Conclusion of the Session Gage
and the Lawyer Left the Hotel
by a Blind Stair
way.
Governor Oajje has arrived in San
Francisco. ThrÂ» manner of his coming
and his conduct after his arrival are
incidents of peneral interest to the peo
ple of the State â ;is (Governor nag^e
came here as the Chief Executive of
California to transact public business.
The visit of Governor (Jago. was no
secret to the army of "oHti"Â«1 ruffians
who swarmed the streets of Sacramento
during the session of the Legislature in
the service of D. M. Burns. Political
tricksters, roustabouts, heelers and he
draffgled parasites thronpr-d the corri
dors of the Palace Hotel in expectation
of the coming of Gage. The news had
been heralded to the throng of place
seekers and for hours they constituted
the Governor's guard of honor.
He did not expert see them and
they did not wish him to do so. Their
petty affairs had been settled in the
h;nk room of a saloon by the man
whose Senatorial banner they had
borne. They were supremely uninter
ested in Gage except to indicate with
their undesirable presence their appre-i
elation of his position.
Governor Gage came here for hlsr^r
game. He came to discuss the chances
of appointing a I'nited States Senator
and of naming a Board of Health, al
ready chosen. His mission was. Der
haps, of national public importance
I'pon his arrival he was sneako'i into
the Palace Hotel. He neither placed
his name upon the hotel register nor
selected a. room in which to lo.ige. He
eluded all questioners, evaded all in
terrupting glances and acted as though
he might have heen a fugltve rather
than the Chief Executive of a State
transacting public business.
Governor Gage was spirited into 'he
hotel and was taken to an apartment
occupied by William F. Herrin, chief of
the law department of the Southern
Pacific Company. This Incident* needs
no comment. It explains wh" the Gov
ernor of California did not wish to be
seen in the hotel. It tells a story deeply
significant. Governor Gage locked hims
elf in a private room to discuss public
business of imperative character with
William F. Herrin.
That conference lasted for several
hours. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon a
door leading into the barroom of the
hotel from a blind stairway slowly
opened. A key had turned in the lock.
for the door is never left unfastened,
and William F. Herrin and Governor
Gage emerged from their hole ur>
stairs.
The Chief Executive of the State and
the chief of the law department of the
Southern Pacific Company took a drink I
and then hastily parted, each taking
his separate way. A conference that
may mean a measure of disaster to the
State was over. Governor Gage had
resumed the burden of affairs of state
and with listening ear, closeted from
the gaze of the public, had heard the
counseling words of an employe of the
Southern Pacific Company.
Governor Gage could not be found
during the remainder of the day or
night. He had disappeared as mysteri
ously as his companion, and it was un
derstood that last night he was the
guest of William F. Herrin at the lat
ter's home.
WILL PROTECT TROUT.
County Ordinances That Will Put a
Stop to the Slaughter of Baby-
Fishes.
The Supervisors of Marin County at
their next meeting will doubtless pass an
ordinance making it a misdemeanor for
any person to have in his possession
trout under five inches in length. The
thorough sportsmen of the city and coun
ty .would gladly welcome the announce
ment of an ordinance of this kind, as the
slaughter of fingerlings has been so great
since the opening of the angling season
thai the Fish Commissioners have about
concluded that the stocking of streams In
Marin and Sonoma counties Is a waste of
time and expense. Some people contend
that an officer of the law would have a
difficult task on his hands to catch an
angler with baby trout in his possession,
but those who oppose the Idea will find
to their chagrin and bitter astonishment
that if such a law is passed that "meas
ures will be taken" by the officers of
Marin County and Fish Commissioners
to prove to the takers of little fishes that
the game of "kill all" will cost them
kdearly in the long run. Every sports
man who enjoys an outing with rod and
gun would be delighted to hear of the
Supervisors of every county in the State
passing ordinances protecting little fishes
and young quail from murder at the
hands of a horde of pot-hunters who go
out into the country not for sport, but
with a view of potting everything that
will satisfy the cravings of the inner man.
A few years ago the Lagunltas and Pa
per Mill creeks in' Marin County and the
Sonoma Creek in Sonoma County were
ideal angling waters, but with the in
crease of alleged anglers who basket
"everything in sieht," not excepting
chubs and bullheads, the trout have al
most disappeared, much to the disgust of
the anglers, who return the little fishes to
their element when they happen on their
hooks. A five-inch trout ordinance is
what Is needed and anglers who desire
to escape the law can easily mark off
five inches on the butts of their rods in
case they capture trout of doubtful size.
It la almost certain, however, that the
Supervisors of Marin and Sonoma coun
ties will ordain that in future the an
gling seasons will not open until May 1
instead of April 1, which is the State law.
Anglers are certainly becoming Interest
ed in the protection of trout, that is.
judging from the letters that are pouring
into this office. This is what a resident
of San Jose says: Htfil
SAX JOSE, April 19. U99.
To the Sporting Editor, Sun Francisco Call-
Dear Sir: I have long wondered why the fish
ing in the once prolific Calaveras Creek should
become BO poor. Hut not until within the last
few days <lld I learn that it was being dyna- '
mited, and by men In our own neighborhood,
viz., Mllpltas. Such wanton destruction of fish
deserves the severest punishment, and now
that the authorities have the leader behind the
prison bars, with the hope of soon getting the
others, I trust the Fish Commission will con
tinue Its good work and exert every effort to
convict and' make such examples of these men
as will deter others from following in their
footsteps. A LOVER OF SPORT.
SAN FRANCISCO, April 21. 1599.
To the Sporting Editor, San Francisco Call â
Pear Sir: Fishing on the Paper Mill (or, as
anglers are now wont to call it, "Trout Nil
Creek") is very poor in the vicinity of Camp
Taylor and Tocoloma, but at Point Reyes fly
fishing was good last Sunday and some very
fair-sized fish were taken by C. Precht, C.
Gate and Bert Spring.
The trout entirely ignored salmon roe, shrimp
and worm. The fish seem to hover in the pools
at the "White House" and the "Sandspit,"
fearful of the upper portions of the stream,
and they have good reason to be.
Mr. Rochefort of Point R^yes is a most ac
commodating fellow. If an angler wishes to
fish at the mouth of the stream he will be
driven to the destination by making known his'
desire on his arrival at the point. The flies
preferred are the black gnat. March brown,
coachman, brown hackle and silver au blae.
The large number of French "tourists" who
are camped on the Paper Mill and who have
visited the San Geronimo, Kigunitae and Ni
caslo creeks have so depleted those streams
by taking all sizes of fish that unless some
stringent measures are. immediately taken to
stop such depredations it will only be a short
time before it- will be hardjy worth while to
mention the aforesaid creeks among the trout
streams of the coast.
When such well-known anglers as A. B.
Finch, Del Cooper, Alex B. Ireland, C. Precht
and W. A. 1... Miller, after fishing a stretch of
from three to five miles on the I^agunltas and
Paper Mill, catch but half a dozen fish each
worth putting in their baskets It Is high time
that a hall was called.
There is quite an agitation in Marin County
at present over the game and fish question,
but if the Supervisors of the county would,
for a period of three years, limit the number
of fish to each angler and at the same time
Impose a fine of $50 upon those who had in
their possession trout less than five inches fish
ing on the foregoing streams would soon be
come what It was in years gone.
By legislation of this kind the angler could
count upon getting a nice mess of trout and
of a size that he would not. be ashamed to
show to his friends. How many anglers of
to-day will exhibit their catch on a train or
boat after returning from a day's outing?
Take the angling fraternity away from Marin
County for one year and the hotels along the
line, as well as the railroads, will think that
a cyclone has visited them. Yours truly,
TREE SPOON.
THE FOX TERRIER CLUB.
Sportsmen Who Will Look After the
Interests of the Cunning Little
Bang Tails.
The Fox Terrier Club reorganized at a
meeting of fanciers in the office of the
Hreeder and Sportsman and the following
named gentlemen were selected as offl
cr is: N. H. Hickman, president, of San
Francisco; W. W. Moore, lirst vice presi
dent, of San Francisco; Rev. J. W. Plin
ton, second vice president, of Victoria,
B. C. ; C. K. Harley, treasurer, of San
Francisco: J. B. Martin, secretary, of San
Francisco; board of directorsâ R. E. de
Lopez of Pleasanton, A. E. Mapes of
Stockton. W. B. Godfrey of San Fran
cisco, Dominick Shannon and Harry Low
den, also of San Francisco.
In addition to the above W. J. McKeon,
W. J. P. Strachan, Matt Kerr and J. P.
Atkins have joined the club.
The matter of offering club medals at
the coming show of the San Francisco
Kennel Club was broached, and in a few
moments sufficient money was subscribed
to purchase six medals, to be awarded as
follows:
One for the best dog puppy, one for the
best bitch puppy, one for the best novice
rioÃ. one for the best novice bitch, one for
the best dog in limit or open class and one
for the best bitch in limit or open class, to
h.' competed for by fox terriers owned by
members of this club.
The initiation fee was waived for a
period of six months, and dues Jlxed at $5
per year.
Messrs. Hickman and Martin were ap
pointed a. committee to purchase medals
and have them suitably engraved.
The opening of the stakes for competl
tion at the show of 1900 was discussed, the
members present favoring two stakes
one for dogs whelped In 1899, to be called
the "Adonis stakes," and one for bitches
whelped In 1899. to be called the "Venus
stakes."
The meeting adjourned until some night
during the dog show, either May 4 or S,
at the Mechanics' Pavilion.
MAPPING THE COUNTRY.
Members of the United States Geolog
ical Survey Here.
L. C. Fletcher, E. C. Barnard and J. G.
Hefty, members of the United States Geo
logical Survey, arrived In this city Fri
day morning from Washington, D. C, and
registered at the Occidental. They have
been detailed to examine the geological
structure of this State with a view to
preparing maps showing such formation.
This work is now being vigorously prose
cuted by the Government throughout the
United States. Mr. Bernard left immedi
ately for San Mateo with his assistant,
Mr. Hefty, where they will begin their la
bors.
Mr. Fletcher's territory will embrace the
district surrounding Napa. and after the
completion of his work in that section
will proceed xo Washington In July to
"map" that State. Mr. Fletcher, when
seen in regard to his work, said:
The mapping up of the entire United States
is more, important than appears at first Blanco.
The Eastern States are beginning: to realize
the valuable nature of the work and their
Legislatures have passed special appropriii
tions to assist the Government. New York
has fjiven $25,000, Pennsylvania, 120.000; while
Maine and Maryland each have contributed
smaller amounts. The total appropriation by
the Federal 'Government allows very little for
each State, and the co-operation of the State
government is of great assistance in carrying
on a. work which en account of Us nature is
tedious and slow at best.
We are engraged In making maps which will
show the roads, drainage, various strata, tim
ber and shape of the country by contour lines.
We also demonstrate its forestry and rous;h
sections. The result of our labor will be found
invaluable from an engineering standpoint,
aside from the geological benefits. The maps
are exceptionally valuable in arid regions,
showing a.s they do the exact location of any
water that there may me. They are a great
aid to the mining industry, "showing the
breaks In the strata and the different kinds
of rock.
A. Turner is now working in th* southern
part of California, and E. T. Perkins is at
present continuing the work inaugurated in
the Yosemite Valley. I was <.t,lii<ed to dis
continue operations In the State of Washing
ton on account of rains and the streams run
ning high, .-specially In the Cascades but will
begin where I left off in the months of Jul .â¢
August and September. The mapping of the
I nlted States is a work of great magnitude,
and it Is impossible to tell when it will be
completed.
TREASURY .JOTE REDEEMED.
It Was for Ten Dollars and Was of
the Issue of 1815.
Several months ago luring P. Lane,
8h !Â« r iS f th( ' First National Bank of
Westneld, Mass., was intrust. with a
ten-dollar Treasury note of the series of
1815, with the request that he sell it, if
possible, or else see if it could be re
deemed. He forwarded the note to the
Fourth National Bank of New York, but
there seemed to be no one In New York
who wanted the old note, so an atternp'
was made to redeem it.
At first the note was sent to the Sub-
Treasury in New York, but it was re
turned, as the officials said they had no
way of proving its genuineness, nor did
they have any available funds to cash it.
The note was then forwarded to Wash
ington, where, after much investigation
and many inspections, it was found to be
genuine and unquestionably good for its
face value.
The issue of which this note was a part
was authorized February 24, 1815, to pay
arrearages In the expenses of the war of
1812. The issue originally was for $25,000,
--000, and the act allowed the reissuance of
notes or their conversion into bonds. Of
the total sum authorized over 000,000
was actually issued and over $7,000,000 re
issued. The notes were redeemable in
nine years or convertible into Government
bonds. When the notes themselves were
for amounts greater than $100 they bore
interest, but for less amounts were pay
able to bearer, and did not bear interest
until converted.
Nearly all of the issue was retired in a
short time, and the last note received at
the Treasury prior to the one in question
was presented in 1542. The ten-dollar
note sent to New York by Cashier Lane
has been redeemed and its redemption
charged to the public debt matured prior
to lSt>l. The note was found to be good
for its face value because no date of ma
turity was mentioned upon it. Some of the
notes of the same issue have been de-,
clared worthless because they were not
properly stamped and signed.
The history of this note is interesting.
Cashier Lane received it from Joseph
Welsh of West Granville, who desired to
have it redeemed if possible. Mr. Welch
writes to Mr. Lane that the note was
given to him In 3871 by Mrs. Cyrus Phelon
of Cranville. In March of that year Mr.
Welch was working for Mr. Phelon, and
as he was going toward the house with a
load of maple syrup he heard a commo
tion, and entering the house found a tire
behind the mantel frame. Breaking open
the frame with a bar he extinguished the
blaze. Later on in removing the rubbish
Mrs. Phelon found the mutilated note in
the lining of a rat's nest and presented
it to Mr. Welch, who kept it until he
turned it over to Mr. Lane a few months
ago.â Springfield (Mass.) Republican.

language for tent. Scandinavia is applied
to ihe peninsula that comprises Norway
and Sweden: also Denmark. The ancient
Scandinavians were a tall, dolichocephalic

MONEY AND MERCHANDISE.
TRADE presented few features of especial im-.
portance last week. Industrial and mercantile
activity continued unabated, as shown by the in
-77 per cent in The bank clearings over the
week last year. The increase at New York was
â  . '' â  :i 44 per cent, at Chicago 25
in. at Philadelphia 51 per cent, at Baltimore 74
San Francisco 38 per cent, and so on.
and Omaha were the only cities of im
throughout the country to show a loss.
Business failures were 187, against -"-'4 for the cor
g week in 1898. As far as these statistics
1 in trade exhibits no diminution.
This expansion, however, seems at the moment to
tic rather than foreign! Our exports to
luntries in .March fell off 7 per cent below
â¢'â : last year. The falling off in
tuffs, provisions, mineral oils and live
: 'â 100,000, but this was offset by
rly 5i0.000.000 in other products. The
in March were $104,463,000, against
817,000 in March, 1898, while the imports were
$J2.~ . â  $61,507,000. This decrease of
in exports and increase of $11,286,000 in
iifnts previously made
that our imports arc steadily crawling up on our ex
ts. We ;.: :.' re domestic business than
considerably more goods abroad.
In co with the above showing it is inter
esting to note that the money circulation is falling
short of the gi [uirements of our immensely
increased business. Henry Clews, the New York
banker, points out that "there has been an increase
of the money in actual circulation, the amount hav
ri=en from $1,756,000,000 on April 1, 1898, to
000 on :' : this month â a gain of
$171,800,000; but of this increase $112,700,000 has con
sisted of gold, which 1- almost entirely unavailable for
active use in trade; so that we may say the increase in
the forms of money available for retail transactions
is only about $00,000,000 within the last twelve
months. This increase in the active circulation, out
side of gold, is at the rate of 3.4 per cent, while the
increase in the transactions of the clearing-houses of
the country was 46.8 per cent within the same period;
which shows an amazing dispartiy between the ex
pansion of the active circulation and that of the gen
eral trade of the country." This docs not mean that
there is a lack of money, but only that convenient
forms of it for conducting retail trade are wanting.
As long as we have an actual increase in gold it will
be easy to supply its equivalent in lighter forms.
The great staples stand about the same as on the
preceding week. Damage to the wheat crop in the
Western States has not improved prices much, as the
weather is now favorable to the development of spring
wheat. Wool is hardly as active, but the market re
mains steady with a fair movement. The iron mills
are working up to their full capacity, but chiefly on
old orders. Cotton rules firm, but the current de
mand is light.
The situation in California is one of great promise.
With several exceptions, the crops are looking excep
tionally well, and higher prices for the exceptions
noted will offset the decrease in the yield. Everybody
expects a fine year for the farmer and merchant, and
if present indications are fulfilled we will break more
than one record in 1899.
Mose Gunst "has went" again. The overland which
left here last night is speeding him to the East and
Europe, where the newspapers will have another
diance to announce: "Mose Gunst has came."
AN EXPENSIVE SUMMERSAULT.
THE moral burden of the expansionists, if they
possess ordinary sensibility, must be almost be
yond endurance. To subsidize intelligence
in order to make the worse appear the better reason
is bad enough, but deliberately to pervert the senti
ments and even the expressions of great statesmen
and Jo represent them as holding opinions they uni
formly repudiated will not admit even of palliation.
A cogent example of this method of libeling the
dead and the great of our country- is an article in a re
cent issue of the Chronicle, directly inconsistent with
its former utterances on the same topic, in which the
false identification of Thomas Jefferson with the pres
ent doctrine of expansion is repeated, and he is also
â falsely commended for having written sentences in re
spect to Louisiana in which, simply because he did
not mention and was not called upon to refer to them,
lie is treated as having ignored and practically over
ridden the constitution and the Declaration of Inde-
p endence.
In the implications of this article, as any instructed
citizen well knows, there is not a single word of truth.
Thomas Jefferson was the chief author of the Declara
tion of Independence. To the moment of his death,
I in all his published writings, private or official, there
was not one line in which he suggested in any form
the government of men without their consent. He
was so close a constructionist of the constitution, so
deeply convinced that it was, as Mr. Webster after
ward said, "the palladium of our liberties," that even
as to the contiguous, necessary and almost uninhab
ited territory of Louisiana, in the. very first of the
quotations published in the Chronicle, he states that
"an amendment to the constitution seems necessary
fcr this purchase."
To attempt to play upon the imaginary ignorance of
the people by placing Jefferson in the attitude of
sanctioning the acquisition by force of arms of
densely populated Asiatic territory> not on this conti
nent nor in a condition to be converted into States,
is a post-mortem insult to the memory of one of the
greatest patriots and statesmen immortalized in our
national history by the common acquiescence of man
kind upon concocted and spurious versions of his
language and of his acts.
The disparagement of Jefferson is akin to the libel
upon William H. Seward, in the article to which we
have alluded. In speaking of the protection ex
tended to African slavery by the constitution, as it
existed before the Civil War, Mr. SewaH asserted
the existence of a higher law â meaning simply that
slavery and freedom were so hostile to each other that
they could not permanently coexist. Mr. Lincoln on
the same point quoted the text that "a house divided
against itself will not stand," and declared that either
freedom or slavery must prevail. Horace Greeley
once indignantly protested against the constitutional
foundation of the "fugitive slave law" and pronounced
ii. "a covenant with hell." But he never denied that
there was a covenant nor proposed to break it by
force or otherwise than through the pressure of pub
lic opinion, expressed in an amendment. None of
these men, none of the founders of the Republican
party, none even of the great men of the present gen
eration, have ever pretended that the constitution did
not bind every citizen nor that it did not extend over
every foot of territory acquired by the Government
Until now even the Chronicle itself has opposed im
perial colonization and insisted that the Philippines
were to be territorially organized and that their in
habitants were to become our Asiatic fellow citizens.
Truth, reason, precedent, sound policy, every ele
ment of real and enduring prosperity, are assailed by
the expansionists. But the people are not fools, and
they can read between the lines. They fully compre
hend the existing and urgent necessity of maintaining
their own institutions as they were originally framed
and have been successfully applied.
THE FIGHTING IN THE PHILIPPINES
EXTRACTS taken from private letters written
by volunteers serving in the Philippines to
friends at home and published in various ex
changes show that the war against the Filipinos is
rapidly becoming one of the most savage in modern
history. The course of the struggle has been marked
again and again by deeds of purest heroism, but on
the whole it has afforded another illustration of
Sherman's grim saying, "War is hell."
Sergeant Major T. W. Lemon of the First
Washington Infantry is quoted as having stated
in a recent letter that every American who
falls into the hands of the Tagals is first tortured
with fiendish ingenuity, and, when past suffering,
is hideously mutilated. Hospitals are favorite objects
of native attack, and the Red Cross flag draws a vol
ley of bullets whenever in range of the enemy.
These things moved the sergeant to prophesy. "I
venture the prediction," he wrote under date of March
1, "that if we ever make an advance through the
country that advance will go down in history a's one
of the most pitilessly cruel of modern times. Can
you blame us if we should thus war on a people who
come up to you with a white flag in one hand and a
knife in the other, and where the men disguise them
selves as women in order the better to accomplish
their design?"
Guy Williams of the lowa Regiment is quoted as
having written in an account of the capture of a na
tive village by that command: "The soldiers made
short work of the whole thing. They looted every
house and found almost- everything from a pair of
wooden shoes up to a piano, and they carried every
thing off or destroyed it. Talk of the natives plunder
ing the towns; I don't think they are in it with the
Fiftieth lowa."
In a letter from Leonard F. Adams of the Wash
ington Regiment are' the statements: '"In the path
of the Washington Regiment and Battery D of the
Sixth Artillery there were 1008 dead niggers and a
great many wounded. One company of the Tennes
see boys was sent into headquarters with thirty
prisoners and got there with about a hundred
chickens and no prisoners."
Fred 1.. Ilinchman. who is described as formerly a
student of the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute but
now serving with the United States engineers, is re
ported to have written of the fight of February 22:
"At the Puente Colgante (suspension bridge) I met
one of our company, who told me that the Four
teenth and Washingtons were driving all before them
and taking no prisoners. This is now our rule of
procedure for cause."
These are dreary stories. It is pleasant to, know
there is a nobler side to the struggle, that abundant
instances have occurred to prove the essential hu
manity and heroism of our boys at the front. Never
theless, it is not strange to learn they are weary of
such strife. Sergeant Elliott of Kansas, who has
recentlyl returned hoir-, is reported to have said:
"There's no use trying to conceal the fact that many
of the men over there now, especially the volunteers,
are homesick and tired of fighting way off there with
nothing in particular to gain. There is not one man
in the whole army now in the Philippines who would
not willingly give up his life for the flag if it was
necessary, but it isn't pleasant to think about dying
at the hands of a foe little better than a savage, and
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1899.
so far away from home. And the thought of its not
ending for several years is not an especially pleasant
one, either."
Suoh is the record made up by the soldiers at the
front in their letters to friends at home. Is the white
man bound by any duty to accept the burden of such
a. war? Is there anything in imperialism which can
repay him if he takes up that burden not as a duty,
but in the hope of profit?
BELMONTS AND ROOSEVELTS.
T~~) RYAN has in New York City two notable op
|\ ponents â one is a Republican, Roosevelt,
' and the other a gold Democrat, Belmont. He
has in the same city just acquired two notable sup
porters â one is a Metropolitan banquet Roosevelt and
the otller is a dollar dinner Belmont. So the Bel
inonts and the Roosevelts have become political
mixed pickles and the public will have to be careful
to avoid confusion.
The Republican Roosevelt, the illustrious Teddy
the Rough Rider, is not likely to be mistaken for
Robert Roosevelt, who at the Metropolitan banquet
declared himself willing to accept the Chicago plat
form and a Western leader for the purpose of mak
ing a strong fight against plutocracy. There is
danger, however, that the Belmonts may be mixed â
that Perry the gold Belmont may be mistaken for
O. H. P. the silver Belmont, and the result upon the
popular mind be disastrous.
Perry Belmont, like all other gold Democrats, is
virtually out of politics. He stands around, makes
speeches, attends swell banquets and poses as a con
servative. He is out of touch with his party and was
nearly lost to memory when it fell to his lot to send
Bryan an invitation to the ten-dollar banquet and
thus become engaged in a little correspondence with
the man from Nebraska that brought him back to
public attention.
O. H. P. Belmont is a new comer in politics, but
is one of the most distinguished society men in New
York, Newport and London. He married the di
vorced wife of W. K. Vanderbilt and is therefore
stepfather-in-law to the Duke of Maryborough and
our own Mrs. Virginia Fair- Vanderbilt. He made
gifts of gorgeous gold plate at the recent high wed
ding, and he has a stable at Newport that is a miracle.
At the dollar dinner he made his first notable political
speech. In the course of it he said:
"We have reached a point when Democracy must
rule or the heirs of this greatest republic that we
know of must bow their necks to the most powerful
plutocracy the world has ever known â mind you, not
even a national plutocracy,, but an international plu
tocracy, without faith or kin, which will drag us to
the most abject slavery. To-day the people are
waking up to the fact that the freedom of man is the
question. The issue will be in 1900. Are we to be
controlled by the cosmopolitan money power or are
we to be free men of this great republic? Nothing
more, nothing less."
As the Belmonts made their money by acting as
agents in New York for Rothschilds, their knowledge
of international plutocracy must be considerable. It
is interesting to find one of them who is opposed to
the scheme by which the paternal fortune was ac
quired. The ten-dollar banquet Roosevelt, it may
be noted, made a speech of about the same kind as
the one-dollar Belmont, so it is evident that such
little things as the price of a dinner do not affect the
ideas or the oratory of the new brand of Bryanism
that has become a fad in the Four Hundred. All the
same, the public shouldn't get the dignitaries
mixed up.
r\ LTIIOUGH Edward J. Pringle, whose death
/ \ was announced on Saturday last, had occupied
no other official station than that of one of the
Supreme Court Commissioners, for forty-five years
or more he had been professionally connected with
much of the heaviest litigation in the State and had
been a distinguished and respected citizen. lie was a
man of a high order of ability, finely educated, not
merely as. a lawyer but in ancient and modern lan
guages and in the best literature, and possessed of a
perfectly untarnished character. As a member of the
firm of Whitcomb, Fringle & Felton, and in other law
firms witli which he was connected, his practice
brought him into contact with the bench, the bar and
the business community to a degree that made his
name familiar to the public.
His reputation extended to the Supreme Court of
the United States. His industry was indomitable, his
courage superb and his modesty sensitive. Without
melodramatic display he achieved many notable vic
tories in courts both of original and of appellate
jurisdiction. He was an earnest Episcopalian and in
this diocese will be greatly missed. He retained his
faculties and his working powers to the end, and dur
ing his brief service as a Commissioner had displayed
rare judicial qualifications. He died as he had lived,
a Christian gentleman, and is worthily represented by
his surviving family.
When the Lexow committee was investigating the
administration of New York City some years ago the
proceedings constitute^ the sensation of the time, and
little imitation Lexow investigations were started all
over the Union. This year the Mazet investigation is
doing the same kind of work in the same city and
hardly gets a notice. It is evident the American people
cannot be fooled twice in one generation by that sort
of a show.
From the way the British and the Germans arc
gibing at one another over the Samoan question it ap
pears the American commissioner will be virtually a
referee of the controversy, and if he doesn't rule both
the contending parties out on some kind of techni
cality and hold the stakes for future arbitration he is
unworthy the title of diplomatist.
The Supervisors will meet to-day to consider finally
the resolution introduced by Supervisor Attridge to
extend to competing lighting companies the same
privileges now enjoyed by the monopoly in thrs city.
The spirit of the resolution has been indorsed during
the past week by more than a score of the improve
ment clubs of the city.
In the absence of any definite information as to the
cause of the indisposition of Vice-President Hobart
the public will conclude that he is sick of his job.
Very few incumbents of that office have ever desired
it a second time.
A Quaker, detected by his wife when kissing the
servant girl, said. "Quit thy peeping or thee will
make trouble in the -family." This is the answer of
the contractors to the people in the embalmed beef
investigation.
It begins to look now as if Dewey day would be
the biggest day of the year in all parts of the United
States and such a May festival as America never saw
before.
Senator Penrose may be quite right in saying Quay
will get a scat by the Governor's appointment, but the
prospects arc it will be a back seat.

A GOOD WORD FOR THE GOVERNOR.
â¢
While Governor Gage was in Los Angeles recently he was asked if
there was any truth in the rumor that he was about to enter upon
the publication of a newspaperâ referring to the statement that had
been made that he (Gage) and Dan Burns, Major McLaughlin and
others had formed a powerful combination to start a Republican morn-
Ing newspaper in San Francisco, to run out The Call and Chronicleâ
and he replied with an emphatic denial and added:
"Do you think I would have signed those anti-cartoon and signature
bills if I had any thoughts of descending to the newspaper level? An
other thing: My administration needs no organ to bolster it up. it
â will speak for Itself."
Sorry to hear that the newspaper project has fallen through. An or
gan of the prize fighte/s and gamblers would have "filled a long felt
want." His administration may not need an organ to "bolster it up."
and yet we* have not seen a Republican organ capable of "descending to
the newspaper level" of bolstering his action in signing a bill to legal
ize prize fighting, and at the same time vetoing a bill to enable women to
vote at school elections. Certainly this "speaks for itself."â Petaluma

MINING BOOMS
NORTH AND EAST
The northern mining region, comprising
Shasta, Trinity and Slskiyou counties, is
fairly booming from end to end. A very
general activity was not noticeable until
last year, when prospectors and capital
ists brought this rich and promising min
eral region well to the front.
"While there are a number of old and
good mines in it, so extensive is it and so
full of hidden mineral-bearing veins that
it is practically virgin ground. For many
years "mining" suggested rathor the old
history of its famous placers than a great
field of present activity. The facts that
most of its ores are base, that there had
been many failures to work them in the
past and that transportation facility
were meager helped retard the develop
ment of the mineral wealth. There must
be many mining locations made and
claims developed for every one that hap
pens to turn out a big mine, and then it
is not the few great mines but the many
small but profitable ones that most stimu
late life and prosperity.
Throughout last year there was a
swarming of 'prospectors in every promis
ing part of this huge region. Hundreds
of claims were located and on scores more
or less development showed riches. enough
to warrant investments by capital. Money
began to stream in by small or large
amounts, and this spring there are prob
ably hundreds of new quartz claims In
these three counties on which steady de
velopment is going on. One hears of com
paratively few.
This year will surely see a great in
crease in the number of prospectors, in
the number of claims on which shafts or
tunnels will proceed and in the number
of mines and prospects sold or bonded.
The snow still lies on much of the ground
which prospectors will seek in this area
of thousands of square miles, but pros- I
pectors are abroad by thousands. A miner
returning to Redding from Trinity Center
last, week met on the way thirty-seven
prospecting outfits going in over thai
road to scatter over Northern Trinity.
A correspondent <>f the Redding Xn â â¢â 
Press writes from Bragdon, on the Trin
ity: "To see so many teams and pedes
trians going north reminds us of the Cof
fee (.'reek boom of '07. Many of the
hardy looking men who pass here are
men that have locations in that neigh
borhood and arc up to develop
them. Others are in search of undiscviv
ered wealth, while a few are just going
to the high mountains to look out for
something. It seems a little early yet.
but there are many going that way."
Correspondents of Northern California
papers generally report a somewhat ac
tivity from Eastern Shasta and Slskiyou
to Del Norte County, where much pros
pecting will also be done this year.
Then news of pales- of mines, of strikes
in mines under operation or development
and new enterprises, new mills, etc., is
abundant.
From along the upper Trinity River
lively reports are weekly things. Two big
dredger propositions have just come to
the front. About twenty-six bar ami
other placer claims reaching down the
river from Braddons have been bonded
tor six months. The parties contemplate.

success of th>- big dredging enterprise ai

pany is figuring 'Hi puling a dredger to

The Keswiek Mountain Miner tells
vaguely of a big scheme to buy the whole
town of Bhasta, the old county seat, clear
the townsite and hydraulic it to bed
rock. This was ;: great camp and town
in its day, as many greybeards will re
member. The gulches about were rich,
and a promising quartz mining district
adjoins 1 it now. The sleepy old place is
in a mining region with a future. The
unworked ground on which it. stands
might pay to work. Indeed, it prospects
v.tll. and there as elsewhere the people
hunt the streets for nuggets after rains,
but the old town is not very likely to be
washed away very soon.
H. ('. M'oodrow, a mining expert from
St. Louis, lias been experting various
mine? on Dog Creek. Shasta County, dur
ing the last two weeks. Among them are
the ' Bacchus. Trinity and the Butter

ore from the Bacchus to the Keswick
smelter.

great Iron Mountain property and the
Keswick smelter, has yet aside J070.000 to

will greatly increase he scale of its op

not be exhausted in many years. The
company now ships the matte from the
smelters to its refinery in New Jersey
The success of this company is shown by
the fact that its profits for 189S were

NEWS OF JOREIGN NAVIES.
French gunners at the sea fortifications
of France are admitted to he deficient by
Mr. Lockroy, Minister of Marine, owing
to the fact that the coast defenses are
jointly under the control of the army and

forts he placed under naval supervision,
as the present dual r::mand means ab

Lorbjoernen and Havoernen, or Sea
I Bear and- Sea Eagle, are the names of
the first two torpedo-boats built at the
dockyard at Copenhagen for the Danish
navy. They are of 143 tons displacement,
146 feet 6 inches In length, and made
twenty-four knots on trial with 2317 horse
power. Smaller boats built by Thorney
. croft in 1884 for the Danish navy cost
$100,000 apiece, while the new boats, BO
per cent larger and one knot faster, cost
only $77,500 each. _
There are thirty-two cruisers of speeds
from 22 to 25 knots belonging to the several
naval â¢ powers of the world, and of
these only twoâ the Powerful and Terri
bleâ credited to the British navy. The
several navies are represented as follows:
France, 5; Japan, 4; Argentine, Chile,
Germany. Brazil and United States. 3
each; China, Italy, Portugal and Great
Britain, 2 each. This number embraces
vessels exceeding 1000 tons displacement.
A third torpedo-boat of the Boa and
Cobra type has been completed at Yarrow
for the Austrian navy. The latest boat
is named Kigyo, and on March 15 last
averaged 24.3 knots during a three hours'
continuous .trial, carrying a load of forty
four tons. These boats are receiving high
praise from British and other naval offi
â¢ is and are pronounced to be better than
any of that size in the British navy. They
are only 130 -tons displacement and about
152 feet in length, but possess excellent
seagoing quality and are capable of
standing usage which would disable
larger and swifter boats.
The Fleurus, a third-class cruiser,
launched in 1.-3, has only recently passed
through a final successful trial. She was
intended to make eighteen knots, but
reached only about seventeen, owing to
defective boilers, and a second set was
put in. "With â Niclauseâ boilers 4000
horsepower was reached with a coal con
sumption of 1% pounds and a speed of
! eighteen knots was attained. While this
vessel has been experimented with for
five years, the speed of cruisers of her
lengthâ which is nearly 230 feetâ has
reached considerably over twenty knots,
and the l^eurus must be classed with the
"back numbers" of other vessels built
twenty years ago.
An armored cruiser named Gromovoi is
nearly ready for launching at the Baltic
works on the Neva, near St. Petersburg.
The vessel is 473 feet in length, 68 feet 6
inches beam and displaces 12,336 tons on a
draft of 26 feet, and will have engines of
18,000 horsepower, calculated to give a sea
speed of 20 knots. The armor belt is of 6
inch Harveyized steel extending for a
length 300 feet, and all the gun protections
are of the same material and thickness.
The battery is unusually heavy and ef
fective in its distribution, consisting of
four 8-inch quick-firers in casemates, two
forward and two aft; sixteen 6-inch quick
firers located as follows: Ten in broad
side on main deck, two aft in recessed
ports, two in recessed ports under fore
castle, one in the eyes of the bow and one
right aft in the stern. The minor guns
are twenty 12-poundera and twenty-four
smaller size down to machine guns, mak
ing a total of G4 guns. The hull will be
wood sheathed and coppered.

Barkentine Ruth Brings News
From Southern Seas.
A Storm Devastates Kusaie While Fight
ing and Bloodshed Rules at Panape
and Ruk With Dire Results.
JHE barker.tine Ruth arrived from the
southern seas yesterday after an ex
citing cruise. She brings the news of
a hurricane it KusaJe, fighting at
PonnpÂ»\ the probable (loath of K. D.
' i'KÂ« fo, the copper kins? of Yap; the re-
L^Wase of J. V. Melander, an American
.-.tiz'n. by the Spaniards: the wreck of
the Horatio and the probable loss of the
missionary schooner Hiram Bingham. In
Huk there is a tribal war and the mis
sionaries have taken sides. John Extrom,
a passenger on the Ruth, lays the blame
for all the trouble at the door of the
preachers of the gospel of peace. At
â¢ I'onape the Germans are trying to pain
a foothold, and the natives are prepared
to fight the moment any concession is
granted them. All In all there were lively
times in the Carolines.
The Ruth brought up Captain West of
the wrecked whaling bark Horatio and
Ms wife; \V. F. Joseph, first officer; Wil
liam Besse. second officer; Theo Burgeon,
sailmaker; A. Johe. boatswain, and two
s-ailors. also of the Horatio. Captain
West has little to add to the account of
the lops of his vessel already published
in The Call. He attempted to enter the
harbor without a pilot and the vessel
crashed <>n a hidden reef and became a
total IO3S. Three tons of copper, seventy
five tÂ«ns of old iron, rigging and gear
from the wre< k was brought up on the
Ruth. The remainder of the barkentine's
carter was 2SS tuns copra and 12,000 cocoa
nuts.
"1 wonder what has become of the
missionary schooner Hiram Bingham?"
said Captain Challeston yesterday. "Cap
tain Walkun was short in his crew, bo he
signed on four of the wrecked sailors
from the Horatio and Bailed from Kusaii
for San Francisco on February 19 last.
1 sailed in the Ruth the next day. and
since that 1 have been to Ponape, where
I lay at anchor a week; to Ruk, where
L' lay another week,, and to Guam, when
; I remained live days. From Guam I came
direct to San Francisco.
"The biggest storm ever known raged
in the Carolines last February. At Kusaie
it carried away two miles of the coral
reef and turned the lagoon harbor Into
it boiling cauldron. Houses were blown
down, c'icoamii and breadfruit" trees were
torn up by the roots and the waters were
backed up until the town was flooded.
l)rs. Channnn and Rife, the missionaries,
with their wives and families were com
pelled to flee to the hills, nd Mrs Oleane
and another woman missionary nearly
lost their lives. I was off the group when
the hurricane came down and 1 never
paw such a blow before. Luckily we were
under snug canvas, but even that was
blown to shreds and we had to scud under
bare poles. The next trader that goes to
Kusaie will hardly recognize the place
and the crop of copra will be light for
several years owing to the number of
cocoanut trees that were blown down.
"You have had the news that J. V. Me
iander, an American trader, had been
m:\de a prisoner by the Spaniards at
Ponape on July 4 last. They not only
made him a prisoner but also confiscated
his schooner. Well, shortly before we
reached Ponape Melander was given his
schooner and was told ho could go as
soon as he pleased. The Governor was
all smiles, assuring Melander that he
never had been a prisoner, as his papers
had not been taken away and he could
have left /in his vessel whenever he
pleased. Melander said nothing, but
seized the opportunity and sailed at once

Thirty years ago he was forced to leave

Mr. Extrom yesterday. "1 am sorry to

with truth, with the breastplate of righteous
ness and his feet shod with the preparation of
peace, with the shield of faith, the helmet of
salvation and the sword of the spirit, our mod
ern knight is prepared to meet the archenemy
of human souls and all the cohorts of evil.
Dr. Locke then defined sin, and spoke
of its origin and the various theories of
the devil, and what the Bible means by
Satan and temptation, and then discussed
at some length what ne termed the "mis
takes of the devil." He referred to the
patriarch Job, who, after repulsing the
temptations of the evil one, was given
"twice as much as he had before."
Among the other calamitous blunders
made by the enemy of souls, he spoke of
the sale of indulgences and the protest of
Luther, of the persecution of the Puri
tans in Europe, of the introduction of
slavery into the New World and how the
freedom of all the slaves of Christendom
was thereby precipitated. He also re
ferred to the treatment which the Bible
had received at the hands of its enemies,
j and he closed by speaking of the evil of
i intemperance. His argument was that

anti-canteen law, he said:
I should not be surprised if it will appear
that the devil has made another mistake for
the success of his cause in the recent nullifica
tion of the anti-canteen law by the Attorney
Oeneral of the United States. It is an Insult
to the intelligence of this nation. Any school- |
boy can see that the plain intent of the law has
been stultified by the illogical and mendacious
interpretation of the Attorney General. I won
der if it will not be another Dred Scott decis
ion! Is Judge Taney to have an Ignoble suc
cessor in John W. Griggs? How long will our
nation trifle with this devil of rum? A long
suffering people should not quietly consent to
this colossal outrage. Are we, indeed, as the '
late Secretary Winilom once said, "A rum-ruled
people?" If this monstrous octopus can put one
of its long tentacles into the Cabinet of the
United States and utterly defy the intent and
purpose of Congressional action, and entirely
misconstrue the plain language of an enacted
law, It Is high time. Indeed, that a whisky
cursed republic should assert Its rights. This I
vile design of the evil one can be reduced to
Ignominious defeat If tumultuous protests are

against her husband. John McA. Brown,
for divorce, to which reference frail
made in nn issue of this paper several
weeks ago, came up for trial before
Judge Burnett at Santa Rosa a few
days ago.
In her original complaint plaintiff pre
ferred pome sensational charges of mis-
Conduct agalnsi Mr. Brown, but the court
sustained a demurrer to this complaint

HEAVY GALE
IS BLOWING
OFF THE COAST
National City Came
Back in Distress.
MACKINAW HAD A HARD TIME
MANY SAILORS ON THE IOWA
SICK WITH MALARIA.
Captain Wallace Takes Charge of the
Pacific Coast Company's Wharves.
Knock-Out Drops for
a Sailor.
It blew a hurricane outside on Satur
'â  day a,nd Sunday, nml vessels that start
|ed north had a terrible time of it. The
i collier Mackinaw, for the sound, was
sighted rolling in the trough of the sea
with her engines stopped; the steamer
\ National City, for Unga Island, pot such
a buffeting that she had to put back for
repairs, and the barkentine Ruth, from
the Southern seas, had her decks swept
while making port.
The National City was under charter to
the Bitka Consolidated Gold Mining Com
pany, and Bailed for Unga on Saturday
morning. It was blowing fresh when the
1 start was made, and as soon as the
steamer was well outside and atraighten
i ed out on her course the wind began to
Increase. When Point Reyes was reach
; ed it was blowing a gale from the north
west, and the stout little craft was bare
ly );..lding her own againsi it. The waves
swept her fore and aft, and one of them
made its way Into the cabin, flooding it.
When the National City was seven
milps northwest of Point Reyes a tre
mendous roller broke aboard. It broke
in the doors and windows of the engine
room, carried away some of the state
room doors, flooded the forecastle and
engine room and drove the firemen on
deck. For a while the vessel lay like a
log on the water, and was at the mercy
of the waves. The firemen immediately
went back to their posts, and kept swam
on the boilers until the vessel was run
into Drakes Bay. An examination of
the vessel was there made, and Captain
Dettmers decided that the best thing he
could do was to return to San Francisco
for repairs. The engine room was fixed
and some repairs made, after which the
vessel came on here, arriving yesterday
morning. She was docked at Channel
str. et. and to-day will be overhauled to
see whether It Is necessary to unload her
or not. â¢
The barkentine Ruth made a very fast
run of thirty-six days from Guam, and
ran Into the hurricane oft' Poini Reyes.
Captain Challeston reports se, ing a
fleet of vessels off shore making heavy
weather of il. Mi' saw the collier Mack
inaw, and her endues were stopped and
she was rolling gunwales under in the
trough of the sea. Half an hour later the
Mackinaw got under way and began to
forge slowly ahead. Captain Challeston
thinks something was wrong with her
machinery.
The vessels that went out on Saturday
were the bark Prussia for the sound, the
Occidental, Samoa, Mary Winkoiman.
Mary Buhn and Alice Hlanchard for
Eureka; Mackinaw tor Tacoma, 11. W.
Bartlett for Bristol Bay, El Rio Rey for
Bowens Landing., Daisy Kowe for COO 3
Hay. Eureka, for Coquiile River and the
Westport for Point Arena. All of these
vessels must have had a lively time of It
in the storm.
The British ship Pyrenees, seventy
three days from Newcastle, X. B. \V\,
arrived yesterday. On March 17 the ves
sel was off the Mitchell group of islands.
The natives came out to the vessel, and
the captain presented them with some
books and papers. The Pyrenees also
caught the storm, and both captain and
crew were glad to make port.
Nearly half the crew on the battleship
lowa are on the sick list, and the men
are loudly protesting. All of them seem
to have more or less malaria, and they
are clamoring for the removal of the ship
to better quarters. The lowa is lying oft
the I'nion Iron Works, and is Just in the
position for the crew 10 get the full bene
fit of the Channel street sewers. This
stench eddies around the warship twice a
daj . and when it is not in motion a few
odors from Butehertown are wafted
north on the breeze. Not very long ago
the battle ship Oregon was lying in the
same place, and all her crew were more
or less sick with malaria. In conse
quence the vessel had to he removed to
an anchorage off Harrison street, and the
necessary repairs made there.
Captain Thomas Wallace of the Walla
Walla takes charge if the Pacific Coast
Steamship Company's wharves to-day.
He has been thirty-three years in the ser
vice of the company, and a better liked
master never trod a ship's deck. He was
offered the superintendency of the
wharves three times, and it was only un
der pressure that he now accepts the po
sition.
.P. W. O'Donnell. a sailor on the United
States ship Badger, was taken to the
Harbor Hospital yesterday by an Ameri
can District Telegraph messenger boy.
The latter said he found the seaman on
the corner of California and Front.
O'Donnell told him that he had been
givrn carbolic acid by a woman in a dive,
and that he was afraid he was going to
die. At the hospital Dr. Shaw pumped
thft sailor out and put him to bed. The
man was in a stupor, and the doctor is
of the opinion that he was given knock
out drops.
The Hawaiian bark Willseott arrived
from Honolulu yesterday. The first part
of the voyage was against contrary
winds, but during the last ten days the
bark averaged 200 miles a day. The Wi.i-
Bcott was refused a Hawaiian register in
Honolulu, and the matter is going to be
fought out in the courts here.
CHARLES H. LEAVITT DEAD.
One of San Francisco's Earliest Me
chanics Passes Away.
Charles H. I,eavitt, one of San Fran
cisco's earliest mechanics, died at his res
idence, 620 Ellis street, yesterday morning
at the age of 70 years. The deceased was
one of the pioneers who in his time and
day helped to build San Francisco from a
tented village to a great metropolitan
city.
He arrived in San Francisco in the
month of January, ISSO, at the age of 20
years, coming from York. Me. Immediate
ly on his arrival he associated himself
with the Pioneer Iron Works, then located
on Jackson street, near Montgomery, and
at once set to work in turning out such
castings as were then in use for the build
ings about the city. His first and princi
pal heavy contract was in casting the iron
doors, still in use, for the Broadway jail
and the old City Hall prison. From Jack
son street the Pioneer Iron Works was
moved to 827 Beale street, where the
foundry was located for a number of
years and known as "Klttredge & Leav
itt's Safe and Lock Manufactory." At
this place considerable work was turned
out for the then modern buildings going
up in and about San Francisco. One of
the heavy contracts undertaken and
pushed to a satisfactory finish was the
Iron work for the State Capitol dome at
Sacramento, which was put in place un
der the immediate supervision of Leavltt.
The construction of all the steel vaults
now in use at the Safe Deposit building at
California and Montgomery streets, the
construction of the gas tanks and piping
in use at the Hotel del Monte, the iron ;
work for the Palace and Baldwin hotels,
with several other buildings, were the
work of the deceased. In former years
the only safes in use in this city, and on
the coast for that matter, were
those turned out by Kittredge &
Leavitt. As an expert on locks
Leavitt had no superior in his
day, and even up to a short time before
his death his services were invariably
called for by bankers and merchants to
open safes that had become refractory in
their workings or where combinations had
been lost.
< tne of Leavitt's room-mates for a num
ber of years was "Billy" O'Brien of bo
nanza fame, when that genial old man con
ducted a whisky saloon in connection with
Millionaire Flood on Washington street.
Injuries to his eyesight caused him to
retire from business about ten years ago,
since which time he lived quietly with his
wife and two daughters at the place
where he died. His funeral will be held
to-morrow at 2 o'clock from his late resi
dence, with interment at Masonic Ceme
tery.
AT THE PARK AND BEACH.
Cold Weather Thins the Crowds â In
teresting Monkey-Naming
Contest.
It was "colder than the Klondike" at
the park and beach yesterday, and the
few people who went out for a day's en
joyment soon hurried home on the
same mission. There was no music, the
drive was deserted, and only an occa
sional half-frozen wheelman appeared on
the paths.
Owing to the fact that shelter is af
forded at the Chutes, a fair crowd vis
ited that resort. Considerable interest is
at present centered on the monkey nam
ing contest. A baby, monkey is now the
pride of the Chutes, and to properly pro
vide the little animal with a suitable name
all the patrons of the ground are allowed
one suggestion as to what its title should
be. the winner to be awarded a prize.
Next Sunday the balloting closes, and a
committee of newspaper men will decide
the contest and christen the proud mon
key.
The usual aquatic contest entertained
the guests at Sutro's Baths. The results
follow: Fifty-yard dashâ First, C. Dono
van; second. H. McKenzle. Fifty-yard

GUNST STARTS* FOR EUROPE.
The Junior Police Commissioner Will
Spend Six Months Abroad.
Police Commissioner Moses A. Gunst
left on last night's overland train for New
York, where he will take passage for
Europe. Mrs. Gunet accompanied him.
They will remain away for six months,
during which time they will journey leis
urely through the pleasant places in the
old world.
At <i recent meeting of the Police Com
missioners Mr. Gunst was granted a leave
of absence from the sittings of the board
so as to enable him to take the trip. He
has not been In the best of health lately
and his physicians decided that the rest
he needed could not be obtained in this
city, where he had so many calls upon
his time and energy from public and pri
vate interests. Somethingrless than a year
ago the Police Commissioner took a sim
ilar vacation without receiving much ben
efit.
ONLY ONE BID
MADE FOR THE
CLIFF HOUSE
C. E. Loose Alone in
the Field.
HIS OFFER TO BE REDUCED
CONSIDERS HIS ORIGINAL j:IG
URE TOO HIGH.
Pabst Brewing Company Not a Com
petitor, but Interested in the
Furniture of the Sea
side Resort.
W. A. Loose of Bodie, Cal., is authority
for the statement that his brother, C E.
Loose of Provo, Utah, is the only bidder
in the field for the Cliff House property.
In a published article it was made to ap
pear that there was a spirited competition
among local and Eastern Capitalists for
the acquisition of the historic .resort. C.
E. Loose, who has amassed a fortune in
mmmg 1 , desired the property as an in
vestment and bid $100,000 for it. Accord
ing to his brother, who is at present in
this city, this 1b the only written bid that
has been filed with A. J. Rich & Co., who
are engineering the pale of the site. In
discussing the matter yesterday Mr.
Loose said:
"I am quite positive that my brother's
bid of $100,000 for the Cliff House property
is the only one that has been made. I
have been busy prosecuting inquiries on
the proposition and have communicated
to him the result of my observations,
which may cause him to materially scale
down the price he has offered.
"In the first place the property cost in
all but $50,000, and the Pabst Brewing
Company put in about $15,000 worth of fur
niture. The only interest of the beer con
cern is to get back the money it put in.
The report that there was a scramble for
the property was made probably for the
very purpose of bringing other prospec
tive purchasers in the field. The brewing
company has made no offer of $150,000.
"My brother has considerable ready
cash which he desires to invest, but he
wants a fair interest for his money. I
have since learned that the rental of the
Cliff House, which was originally $1000 a
month, has been reduced to $700. and even
at the lower figure the rent is not always
forthcoming and is now several months in
arrears. It was my brother's intention to
spend $23,000 additional in improving the
seaside resort. I have advised him that
$75 000 is a fair price for it and this, with
the $25.0W for repairs, will bring it up to
the original figure of $100,000.
"We both consider the investment a
good one, as it is not likely that there
will ever be another cliff house built and
the old place will always enjoy a monop
oly. It was through Mr. Wilkins, a friend
of my brother, that the idea was con
ceived to acquire possesssion.
"It is my brother's option to reduce his
! bid if he s"o desires, and it is highly prob
able that $75,000 is as high as he will go.
i At that figure he can expect a fair return
j on his investment."
ALVA ADAMS ARRIVES.
The Prominent Colorado Politician
and Ex-Governor Here on
a Visit.
Alva Adams. ex-Governor of Colorado
and one of the most prominent Demo
cratic politicians of that State, arrived
in this city yesterday morning from Los
Angeles, where he has been stopping for
the last five weeks.
Mr. Adams has large property interests
throughout the West, and is to-day one
of the most popular men in Colorado. At
the conclusion of his last term of office
he declined the renomination which was
persistently offered him. "I am out of
politics," he said yesterday, "to return
no more. *y business interests demand
my immediate attention, and I have quit
the field of political strife for all time."
Mr. Adams is prominently identified \
with the big mining industry of Colorado.:
He is the principal owner of the eele- j
brated Tom Boy mine, which Is a prop- '
erty yielding a monthly dividend of j
$90,000.
Mr. Adams is accompanied by his wife.

Oakland Cripples Again
Defeated.
HO GAME AT GOLDEN GATE
JJEW GROUNDS IN BAD CONDI
TION OWING TO RAIN.
Watsonville Breaks Its Hoodoo and
Shuts Out San Jose in One of
the Best Games of the
Season.
Fred Bwanton took his aggregation of
er to Golilnn Grate yesterday
assist Ewing and ais cripples
w ball BTOunds, but owing
[ness of the weather during the
morning hours the rich black loam
to planting cabbages
in than playing hall on. so after skating
around on the slippery soil to satisfy
themselves of its real condition players
and managers concluded to postpone the
same.
Quite a delegation of cranks from both
sidfÂ»s of the hay were on hand notwith
standing the frequent showers, but they
accepted the decision of "no game" with
out a murmur and all hands came over to
this side, invading Recreation Park In the
afternoon. They were met by 2000 or 3000
more fanatics, who saw the Oaklanders
go dovsn to defeat again in a game that
lacked the snap and dash of the one on
Saturuay. '
Louis lisa was in the box for the crus
taceans, and, while he did not equal Don
lin'-* strike-out record, in other respects
his work was up to that of his associate.
Oakland could not place the ball safe
when hits were needed, and that about
tells the story. In addition, the cripples
put up a ragged fielding game, something
thf-y arc not in the habit of doing, while
the' three errors of Santa Cruz had no
bearing whatever on the result.
Th*re \\>re some slight changes in both
teams. "Monkey" Purge was put in at
center for Panta Cruz. Cameron holding
down the bench. i >onlin farmed out In
right field because of his hitting ability,
and it proved to be a wise move, for three
of the tfn hits made by the team fell to
him. one of them being a double.
For Oakland Donovan rode his Charley
hof-e in center, Ing careful not to
founder it by overwork. Murphy covered
lirst. it being his final appearance on the
diamond, for the present, at least, as he
prefers the certainty of a plebeian com
mercial salary to the uncertain glory and
emoluments of baseball. Hereafter Mos
kimon will fill that position regularly.
Santa Cruz started the tallying in the
spcond. Streib reaching second on ("roll's
muff of his long fly. taking third on a
passed ball and being driven in by Arel
lanos' single. Another came to them in
the third Inning, when with two men out
Devereaux worked a pass and was batted
b round by Pace and Clarke.
Oakland got Its solitary credit mark in
th. fourth. Murphy opened with a double,
was advanced to third on Hilly Ham
mond's single and came in when "Clam
Juice" Lou sent out a long fly to Burge.
In the fifth Santa Cruz clinched the
game with a pair of tallies. "Williams was
safe on L. Hammond's error and was
chased to third by Donlin's double. Then,
after Clarke sent out a fly to Donovan,
both runners scored on Pace's single.
Donlin scored the last run in the ninth,
reaching first on a bunt and completing
the circuit on misplaya by Moskimon and
"W. Hammond. The score:

FORGET TAKES
FIRST MONEY
AT NEWARK
Pretty Girl Causes a
Big Surprise.
SHE WAS THE RUNNER-UP
PUPPY BEATS OLDER DOGS IN
HANDSOME STYLE.
Good Sport at the Picnic Given by the
Ingleside Coursing Association.
The Old Grounds to Be
Reopened.
Pretty Girl, a puppy owned by J. H.
Pf^ripo, caused a general upset at Newark
yesterday. She was entered in the open
stake given by the Ingleside Coursing As
sociation in connection with its picnic on
the old coursing grounds in Alameda
County, and although beaten in the llnal
by the crack Forget, she proved that she
ip a comer and with a little more experi
ence not to be despised in any company.
A special tr.-iin carrying 150 dog-loving
picnickers and a band left Alameda mole
at 9:40 o'clock and arrived at Newark at
10:30.
Rain fell at intervals until 2 p. m., but
nothing could quench the enthusiasm of
the party, and the character of the sport
was such that few complained of the ab
sence of a sheltering grand stand at the
coursing grounds. Men and women
watched the dogs run, unmindful of
either wind or rain. After lunch the
showers became less frequent and soon ;
igether.
Th< work of the does was generally]
bui the short-enders pot the tlae iii
numerous Pretty c.yt\ par
ticularly was played on the short end i
from the start. While her showing was
remarkable In consideration of the fact
thai she has run but few races In her
period "ii earth, it must be noted
that she was also lucky. In the first run
< ! '"^" after a no go with Lady Gilmore a
.. to _ favorite, the latter was withdrawn
owing to losing a tenth, the course being
then given to Pretty Girl. In the uecon!
round she caused the- biggest surprise of
the day by Beating Mac's Melody at l to
CALIFORNIA AS SAIL
IN ROUGH WEATHER
Yesterday's Stopm JWapped the Pro
posed Cruise of tlje Combined
Fleets.
THK stormy weather of yesterday
marred the proposed cruise of the
California and Corinthian fleets In
company along the city front. The
Callfernlas kept their part of the en
gagement, but the Corinthian yachts
did not reach the trysting-place. At
about 10:45 a. m. tho California*!, de
pplte the nasty, equally weather, nailed
down Oakland Creek under a beam
â¢vrind and made Prealdlo nhoal buoyâ
the appointed mprting-plareâ about
noon. Tho fleet, which was under the
command of Commodore Allen M,
Clay in his sloop Poctolus, oomprlaed
the following yacht*: H. S. Pratt's
6, and she won on her merits, too. In
the third round she beat Expense, and
in the fourth vanquished Nelly B by a
narrow margin. But Forget was too fleet
for the game lltte bitch, and she was
obliged to content herself with second
money. Forget, the winner of the stake,
was In fine form and ran consistently.
He beat Hadiwist in the opening round
at 1 to 2, and in the second got a bye
through the withdrawal of Mystic, beat
Benicia Boy In the third and Conley In
the fourth. Winning Style was with
drawn alter the second round, her owners
rearing she might injure her feet on the
hard ground. "Long Shot" Conley and
iselly B also ran in good form, the former
finally succumbing to Forget and the
latter to Pretty Girl in the fourth round.
Altogether the sport 'waa first class.
Coursing will be resumed at the Ingle
side grounds within two weeks, according
to the officers of tne association. In fact,
iney expect to complete arrangements for
opening the park to dogs next Saturday.

LAWRENCE WON AT UNION
Motto and Mercy May Again
Met and the Former Dog
Secured the Flag.
The great feature of yesterday's cours
ing at Union Park was the meeting of
Motto and Mercy May in the third round
of the open stake, which resulted In a
victory for the former dog.
The open stake was won by Lawrence,
and the runner-up was Moondyne. The
entries were not up to the usual stand
ard, in fact it was a day off for the high
class dogs. Silver Lyon was the surprise
of the day as regards Improvement. He
put out Battleship in short order in the
second round,, and when slipped to a
Btraight-away hare in the next round
with False Flatterer led up to a good
distance and for a few turns made the
"pikers' " hearts beat high with expec
tations of cashing a good long shot.
Young America ran well up into the stake
and secured third money. He was up
against hard game all day, defeating
False Flatterer, Blackette, Glen Roy and
Eleven Spot. Miss Rabbit won another
course in the stake on the short end, de
feating Magic at the good odds of 4 to 1.
The hare took all the run out of both
dogs, but when the flag was up Miss
Rabbit's followers had all the money.
The sapling stake was a great chance
for the youngsters to make a good show
ing, as the hares were not too strong, and
well did they make their initial run.
Pat organ carried off the honors in the
class, but he was well seconded by his
kennel companion, Manila. The first
and second money went to the owner of
both these dogs. The results of the day

day at the grounds of the Lincoln Gun

THE FEAST OF
SAINT JOSEPH
Crowds at the Catho

FATHER HANNIGAN'S SERMON
MISSION AT ST. HOSE'S HAS A
FITTING FINALE.
â ptorist Fathers Inaugurate a
Series of Missions at St.
Patrick's â Other
Notes.
The feast of the Patronage of St. Joseph
was observed in Catholic circles through
out the world yesterday. In this city the
churches were crowded with worshipers
who listened to panegyrics on the saint
tr> whom, next to the Virgin Mary, the
Catholics pay their highest veneration.
Father J. B. Hannigan delivered .the
sermon t at St. Mary's Cathedral at the 11
o'clock mass. In an interesting manner
he lold of the reason why the church hon
ored and venerated the Faints, lie said
it was because of their standing high in
the favor of God; that they were mem
bers of the church triumphant and there
fore still interested in the church on
earth, and because the church on earth
looks to them for their intercession in
prayer before the throne of God in be
half or herself and her children still on
earth. The speaker went on to say that
on these grounds the church gave the
highest honor and glory to St. Joseph be
cause, next to the blessed Virgin, he holds
the highest place in heaven. Father Han- ;
nigan then told of the good deeds per
formed by the saint, his simplicity of
manner and the unostentatious way he
wÂ» nt about his work. The speaker dwelt
0:1 St. Joseph's confidence in God and hid
purity, and in conclusion said that be
cause of all these virtues the church
chose him as her special patron and in
tercessor before the throne of God. In
the evening- Father Dempsey delivered the
sermon.
At St. Ignatius Cathedral a sermon on
the saint was preached by Father Woods.
In the evening the monthly exercises pre
paratory to the consecration of the twen
tieth century to the Lord were held. The
services were beautiful ' and impressive
and were attended by a large congrega
tion. Rev. Henry K. Woods, S. J., deliv
ered an able sermon 0:1 the occasion. The
music was a feature of the celebration.
an excellent programme being rendered
by the choir. Battista's "Mass in G" was
beautifully sung. At the offertory "Te
Joseph Celebrant" was rendered. At ves
pers (Bregorian) Klein's "Iste Confess
or" aiid WiUard's "Magnificat" were ren
dered. At the solemn benediction Melvil'S
"Regina Coeli" and "Tantum Krgo," by
M'-rcadante, were sung. The organ se
lections, from Gullrnont, Dubois. Capocci
and â¢ Fumegalli, by Maurice O'Connell,
were listened to with pleasure by those
present.
The series of missions which were held
at St. Rose's by the â¢:â  â¢â¢ ; torlst Fath
ers came to a close last night. The sue- j
cess achieved by Fathers Distler, Cant-!
well. McGeough and Ilild has been grati- j
fying. According to one of the fathers 1
more persons have received the sacra- j
rnent than at former missions. During
the past week the church has been crowd- '
ed to the doors with worshipers anxious
to hear the words of wisdom that fell
from the lips of the priests.
Father McGeough spoke upon â¢ the
"Means of Perseverance" last evening.
He gave as the principal means prayer,
frequentation of the tacrament and the
avoiding of occasional sin. The sermon
was replete with illustrations, and was" a
lining finale to the sermons of the past
week. V. .
At the 11 o'clock mass in the morning
Father Distler preached on "The Neces
sity of Prayer." In the course of his
frrmon the speaker told his congregation
that there were three qualities of prayer.
He said the first was "interior," and that
it m â .:.- come from the heart; the second
must be "humble." In dwelling upon it
he illustrated his meaning with the
parable of the publican and Pharisee;
and, thirdly, the prayers must be "confi
dent." Father Distler laid great stress
on the fact that the prayer must be per
severing in character. He gave two
strong illustrations in support of the last
point. He told of the woman whose
daughter was possessed of the devil and
how the mother appealed to Christ for
relief, and of the blind man who prayed
for vision, and how their prayers were
answered on account of their persever
ance.
Father Gleason's splendid barytone
voice was heard to advantage during his
Finging of the mass which preceded the
t tirmon.
Father Distler will this morning de
liver a sermon on "How to Relieve the
Buffering Souls in Purgatory."
Yesterday afternoon Fathers Bond ana
Fagan opened the mission for children at
St. Patrick's. The basement of the wr-11
--known church was crowded with the
children of the parish. The services were
very successful, and will be conducted i
during the present week every moon
at - 3:30 o'clock. Fathers Distler, Hl!d,
Cantwell and McGeough will also par
ipate in the missions for women and men
that are to be held at St. Patrick's dur
ir.g the coming week.
Owing to the fact that the decorators
have not yet completed their work in
the church, the services for children will
lip - ducted in the basement. On Sun
day next the church will be opened to
vo'rshipers and the usual services will
be held. Many thousands of dollars have
been expended in beautifying the in
terior, and the parishioners are looking
forward to thÂ« opening with pleasurable
anticipation; _

THE ALMSHOUSE CUPID IS
ARMED WITH MUTTON CHOPS
THE old adage. "When poverty
c imes in at the postern, love
Mies out at the window," Btands
once again proven by an excep
tion. Out at the Almshouse two
tender souls, pierced by Cupid's
-depriving darts, are luxuriating
in all the misery of a true love whose
course, naturally, is running anything
but smoothly.
It is a tender, touching tale of the
compelling powers of a beauty years
may not efface, a woman's elastic
heart, the elevating powers of love,
together with the extravagant
lengths to which a man wounded by
Eros' darts will allow himself to go.
There is also a heinous villain mixed
up in the romance, who, protected
with the little brief authority of an
officer's star, tore the lovers apart
and incarcerated the heroine In "No.
3," otherwise a building surrounded
by a fence so high that even the hero
with his "wings of love" could not
scale it.
Mrs. St. Yves Is a pretty English
woman, 45 years of age, who is af
forded the hospitality of the "poor
house" on account of a depleted
purse and a paralytic stroke that has
deprived her of the use of one-half
of her body. The dread disease has
not I bed the lady of her attractive
ness. Her large blue eyes are full of
a tender, melting light, and her Huffy
golden tresses, though streaked with
silver threads, may still ensnare
when surmounted by the dainty bon
nets bedecked with the coquettish
little bows that she so much affects.
His name Is Smith, plain John
Smith. The frosts of sixty winters
have silvered his temples, but left his
heart warm, his eye keen and sensi
tive to the enjoyment of a comely
person, and. if he has not "dough,"
he has mutton chops to burn. But
that is anticipating the story.
Before Smith was registered at the
Almshouse Collins had apartments
there. Collins' particular trouble was
a defective vision that forbade the
sight of all things save a few gleam
ing rays of light.

present about three hundred and fifty
persons, who enjoyed a fine programme,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL., MONDAY, APRIL 24, 1899.
and loved is known only to them
selves. The official Almshouse knowl
edge of the matter is limited to the
fact that some few months ago the
paralyzed lady and the blind man
disappeared. Three months later Mrs.
St. Yves returnedâ alone. Her lips
were sealed as to what had occurred
in that brief sojourn in the world
where it requires money to live. No
record was found of a marriage, and
Collins never came back. The "poor
house" officials say that when Mrs.
St. Yves returned after that myste
rious absence "she was in a dreadful
state." However in a few days the
fair eloper resumed her natural tidy
appearance, and then she met Smith.
At first it was only a bowing ac
quaintance, but "good day" and "fine
evening" soon made way for more
lengthy conversations. Acquaintance
ship ripened into friendship, and final
ly the inevitable happened. Mrs. St.
Yves resided at "No. 4," a dwelling
protected from vulgar gaze by a
whitewashed fence, not too high,
however, for a long arm, a stout
heart and an extravagant caprice.
Not many moonlit evenings ago the
guard saw Smith hovering near the
fence. Cautiously the aged swain
crept close to the cruel partition,
raised his armâ but that was as far
as he got. He was caught in the very
aot, and the dainty mutton chops he
was prepared to lay on love's altar
were confiscated by the minion of the
law. Mrs. St. Yves' residence was
changed and Smith's actions closely
led.
Now the lovers only meet Sunday
mornings at church, where guards
may not Interfere if they manage to
slip in tender nothings between the
responses. At the last entertainment
Mrs. St. Yves and Mr. Smith were
allowed the pleasure of each other's
company. Mrs. St. Yves had orange
bows in her bonnet and Smith was
the only man in the room with a
white shirt on.
In a way the Almshouse authorities
are pleased with Smith's presence at
the institution. He acts as a whole
pome preventive that keeps off the
: gallants, who would all
be offering mutton chops to Mrs. St.
Yves if it were not for Smith.

Will Be Charged With
Vagrancy.
Lieutenant Esola and Sergeant Dono

The four raids were made with a rush,
i The squads started out from the head
! quarters on Washington street at about
9:80, and each man had his instructions.
, They were to show their faces at the
I doors, demand admittance, and if the
doors were not at once opened to smash
, them in with axes. To make everything
safe the officers were provided with
search warrants for the clubs Beie.ted.
At the two clubs in Washington alley
sixu<>n men were captured, and sufficient
evidence, was secured to warrant their ar
j rest. The Oriental Club furnished twenty
j four more men and a fantan layout, and
twelve men were taken from the Occi
dental Club.
All were taken to the California-street
station and locked up on a charge of vis
iting a fantan game. The lookouts were

I there were Chinese. Japanese, Filipinos
nnd a few nondescripts who appeared to
be a mixture of all races.

NEWSPAPERS

OF THE POLICE
Rev.. F. C. Lee Utters
Strong Sentiments.
. Â»
CALLS CHIEF LEES TO ACTION
DENOUNCES CHINATOWN AND
"PICTURE PARLORS."
Says the Police Officials Remain Inert
Until They Are Awakened by
a Burst of Public In
dignation.
Rev. Frederick C. Lee, pastor of the
California-street Methodist Episcopal
Church, last evening delivered an elo
quent sermon on the existing evils in San
Francisco. He called attention to the fact
that nearly in every case where the at
tention of the police has resulted in the
edification of public morals the press has
first ventilated the evils so thoroughly as
to force the officers into action by over
whelming indignation from the law-abid
ing element of the community. He con
cluded his remarks by advising Chief
Lees to resign his position in favor of an
active man, if he finds its burdens too
cumbrous by reason of his advanced ace.
In part he said:
Is Chief Lees in need of a guide to China
town?
In the words of the great immortal Caesar
1 would answer "Minime," which, trans
lated Into south of Market Anglo-Saxon,
means "Not much." Distinguish between
the chief needing a guide and his being
compelled to use one.
Can it be possible that a man
who has been connected with the
police force of San Francisco for
forty years, as detective and
Chief, needs any pointers from
the outside That the Chief needs
no guide to Chinatown was plain
ly manifested when on Thursday
last he handed over to Sergeant
Donovan the street and number
of over fifty fan-tan and lottery
layouts. When did he come into
possession of these facts the
night before? Then he could have
had them, and ought to have had
â¢ them, six months before. Has he
had them for weeks and months â
then what has he been doing
with them, keeping them for the
Directory of 1900?
There are just two horns to
this bull in Chinatown, and the
Chief is at perfect liberty to pick
his horn. If he does not know
what is going on, what is he in
office for? And if he does know
what is going on, what is he paid
forP Is he a fool or a fraud?
It Is a remarkably strange thing to me
that the police are always dependent" upon
the papers or private citizens for their in
formation. It Is not until these "city skele
tons" are dragged Into the open by the
newspapers chat the police begin to show
any signs of life or interest. Why should
the policeâ from patrolman to chicf â compel
the citizen to make the initiative? Are not
the evils of Chinatown to-day about what
they were six months ago? And yet It was
DOt until the Examiner took up the fight
recently that any concern was manifest.
Were not the "picture parlors" on Market
street as vile and the phonographs as foul
three months ago as they were last week?
And yet it was not until The Call had rung
up the "central office" and exposed the
nastlness of these "animal-scopes" that any
arrests were made and punishment Inflicted,
while officers were passing these "peep
holes" a dozen times a day. 'What right
have the police to wait tor complaints to be
made through the press? What right have
the police to compel either firms or
Individuals to do police duty without pay?
And when a newspaper or a private citizen
does <o warfaring at his own expense, and
does work for which the police are being
paid, the greatest obstacles he runs up
against are offlclaj know-nothings in blue
cloth and brass buttons. That men and
women will do wrong nobody doubts. That
they will do so in spite of law, police,
preacher, punishment and God â nobody de
nies. But that dens and brothelsâ such as
exist in Bacon place and the Chinese quar
tersâwhere the vicious and the criminal
, congregate, that nesting places and breed
" ing grounds should be allowed to flourish
right under the very nose of the police, Is
preposterous. The law is already on the
statute books â the officer has to do Is
to enforce H. This he does not do because
upon his own authority he decides that the
law is a dead letter. If it is he has mur
dered it by neglect. An officer has no right
to play the part of a coroner and declare a
law "dead." and then hide his official ras
cality behind its carcass. Governor Roose
velt of New York has said that "a dead
letter law is worse than hypocrisy in the
church." Look at the accursed traffic In
Chinese girls, being carried on here in one
of the leading cities of the United States.
On next Fourth of July we will spout and
do the read-eagle" act about "being born
free and equal." We will sing about "the
land of the free and the home of the brave,"
and yet the slave trade as carried on right
here In San Francisco this very hour Is more
disgraceful, more destructive and damnable
than Southern slavery ever dared be. .
Tell me that these things cannot be sup
pressed. Tell me that there is not power
enough In our city and State to wipe out
this hideous business that puts our Govern
ment and nation on a par with that of the
Sultan of Turkey or some Arab slave
hunter In equatorial Africa. Such a con
fession Is a humiliating confession of weak
ness. Think of Itâ a handful of exports from
the "Lepery Kingdom" defying the com
monwealth of California. My advice to our
servant, the Chief of Police, is that if he is
too old or too incompetent to grapple with
these heathen law-breakers, then let him
â¢ get out , nad make room for one who can â
and there are plenty of them. I stand here
to declare publicly that for a Chief of Po
lice determined to do his sworn duty, seek-'.
ing no man's favor and fearing no man's
frown, for such a man thirty days would
be long enough to shut, every "rathole"
within the limits of California and Jack
son. Powell and Kearny streetsâ to say
nothing- of those on the outside.
I hope Sergeant Donovan will prove Ills
right to the title of "Honest Jim," and that
In him we â¢ will have an officer "above
money and above Price." .

For the present there is a cessation of

all the gambling dens were attached to

r jeopardizes bis chance for a re
newal of his license by permitting gam-
Ming. The most marked effect of shut
ting up the dens is thr- large Increase In
the number of vagrants thus thrown on [
the streets. Scores of men and youths
Who have no other means of a livelihood
than the keno joint or the rac< track are
now parading the sidewalks looking for
portunity to follow their calling, l!
is surprising that many of these fellows
have noi been landed In the city prison,
for several of them are daily seen to be

is n< ': assurance, for even the
Mayor and City Attorney have stated that
the deeds to the city from the Water

what benefit the city acquires for its gen- ;
eroslty, and the opinion la prevalent that'
ihe benefit will not be half so large as it
to be during the agitation for >

not be half nor a quarter enough mud left
to be taken from th.- lake under the exist
ing contract to tiil the immense Tract be
between Kiirhth and Twelfth streets, the
bulkhead now being built and the west
Bhore. No one can say or has said how
much of this great till will be left when
the contra* t is ci mpleted, and there Is an
Idea prevalent that it will take a large ap
propriation for several years before the
promised park will materialize. It was

thoiiph the contract demands that all

of it can be done by that time. The Mayor
could relieve much public suspense by In

committee to Issue a report on these mat

Mayor Snow wants to know why stroot
sprinkling, which cost (28,000 nine years

JORDAN TO THE SOCIALISTS.
He Talks About "The Man With the
Hoe."
OAKLAND, April 23.â President David
Starr Jordan delivered an interesting lec
ture at Grand Army Hall to-night under
the auspices of the socialists on "The Man
Who is Left." After reciting Markham's
now famous poem, "The Man With the
Hoe," the speaker said in part:
â¢'We all know Mr. Markham as a poet,
gentleman, scholar and teacher. I do not
think the science of his poem about Mil
iii's peasant is quite sound. He does not
need to defend it. It is poetry, not
science. There are such men with the hoe
everywhereâ dull, stupid, . with heavy
Jaws, lacking luster in their eyes. I have
seen many of this type, but when I saw
them chained to the wheel of labor it was
not revolving. True, there are more than
ought to be In France, but influences have
taken out many of the better class, leav
ing these behind. This is not the labor
problem, nor is it related to capital in
any way. Nor is it the greater problem
of the relation of individuals to trusts,
which fis now coming up and is hard to
aolve."

Mrs. Price of Los Angeles Entertains
Grave Fears That Her Invalid

His Life.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
3 Broadway. April 22.
Charles H. Price, a Los Angeles crock
ery salesman, has dropped put of sight
as though the earth had opened and swal
lowed him.
Price and bis wife en me over from San
â  s.o >â  sterday, where be had been

They registered at the St. Lawrence, cor
ner of Seventh and Franklin streets, and
about â¢! o'clock yesterdaj afternoon -Mrs.
Price Btepped Into the Owl Drug -
some medicine, while -Mr. Price waited
outside. When Mrs. Trie lUt on
the sidewalk her husband had disap]
and he has not been seen by her
Mrs. Price is exceedingly upprehensi
to her husband's safety and fears that he
has perhaps taken his life.
"Mr. Price has suffered from spinal
troubles the past two years," said Mrs.
Price this evening. "A month ago W<
our home In Los Angeles, and since then
Mr Price lias been undergoing treatment
in San Francisco. Ho did not appear to
improve, and was very much discouraged.
He frequently during those spells made
threats that he would yet do away with
himself if his suffering did not soon cease.
"Yesterday we came to Oakland, in
tending to remain here a while. In the
afternoon we went to the drugstore to buy
some medicine. When I came out he
was gone, j have not seen him since and
fear the worst.
"His brother, William L. Price, resides
in Fast Oakland, and I thought he might
have gone there, but I called there to-day
they had not Been him. About twelve
years ago Mr. Price was employed with
H. P. Moreol, the Alameda real estate
man, and I thought maybe he had
tramped there on a visit, but my Inqu
did not relieve my anxiety.
"My husband talked peculiarly yester
day and I am sure his spine trouble has
affected his mind. 1 am afraid he has
done the worst. He hadn't a cent with
him."
Inquiry at the Receiving Hospital and
jails failed to solve the mysterious disap
pearance. The missing man is of medium
Btature, about 47 years of age, slightly
bald, and he has a dark heavy mustache.
He was dressed In a dark suit and over
coat and a slouch hat.

BERKELEY SELECTS
A NEW CAPTAIN
BERKELEY,
April 23.â The
University of
Calif ornia
has selected a
captain for next
year's track team,
the choice falling
upon William P.
Drum. As soon, as
the Berkeley ath
letes had .doffed
their spikes after
yesterday's events
on the cinder track
they repaired to
San Francisco to
celebrate the vic
tory at an elabor
ate banquet. It
was' when the en
thusiasm over the
successful outcome
of the contest
reached Its highest
point that the men
turned toward the
work for the com
ing year, and with
out a single dis
senting voice asked
Drum to be their
captain.
Drum holds an
enviable record as
an athlete. He en
tered the Univer
sity of California
as a freshman with
the class of 1000.
During his first
year â¢ he established
his reputation as a
sprinter by carry
ing off first place
In the 100. the 220
and 440 yard dashes at the intercollegiate field day of 1897 with Stanford.
He was able to repeat this performance at the field day of 1898 in a way
that has made his fame as a sprinter. While his time in the 100-yard dash
has thus far b.een brought down" to 10 1-5 seconds, the U. C. men are con
fident that with another season's training he may lower it to 10 seconds
Hat. â¢â¢
Drum intends to follow out the policy adopted by Hoffman, captain of
this year's team. Toward the latter part of next term the men may begin
to practice on the track, but active work will not commence until February
of the term following.

ATTEMPTED TO
WRECK THE HOME
OF HIS FRIEND
William Chambers on
the Rampage, v
WAS MAD AT MRS. HALPRUNER
SHE FLED WHILE HE SMASHED
HER FURNITURE.
The Woman's Husband Was Unfor
tunately Not at Home and Con
siderable Mystery Sur
rounds the Affair.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
142S Park Street, April 23.
Acting under the impulse of a real or
fancied grievance. William H. Chambers
of 1531 Eagle avenuo made an attack last
I night on the home of his friend, Dr. W. S.
Halpruner, 1501 Pacinc avenue, and after
driving Mrs. Halpruner from the house
destroyed considerable furniture and car
ried away several articles which took his
fancy.
Chambers was arrested later by Officer
Edward Hadley and taken to the City
Prison, where charges of malicious mis
chief, disturbing the peace and petty lar
ceny were placed against him. The com
plaints were sworn to by Mrs. Halpruner
J before Justice of the Peace Henry Morris.
The parties connected with the affair
are not inclined to discuss It, but from
the officer who made the arrest it is
; learned that Chambers visited the Hal
i pruner home about 7 o'clock last evening.
: Mrs. Halpruner was alone at the time.
: Shortly after Chambers gained admit
i tance the neighbors were attracted by a
| woman's cries for help and noticed Mrs.
j Halpruner fleeing bareheaded from her
home, closely pursued by Chambers. He
did not continue the chase, but returned
to the house, and while Mrs. Halprtiner
was seeking assistance from the police
he amused himself by smashing the fur
niture and ransacking the premises. Be
fore Officer Hadley arrived Chambers had
disappeared, but was taken into custody
later near his home on Eagle avenue. A
pair of opera glasses and some trinkets
taken from the Halpruner residence were
found on his person and are held by the
police to be used as evidence against him.
This is not the first time that the names
of Mrs. Hal primer and Chambers have
figured together. Some time ago they
went rowing on the estuary in a frail
craft, and while Mrs. Halpruner was en
deavoring to convince her companion that
she was an expert with a paddle she cap
sized the boat. She and Chambers would
have been drowned had they not had the
good fortune to seize a passing log, to
which they clung until they drifted
ashore.
Chambers furnished bail to-night. Judge
Waymire qualifying for the amount re
quired. ________ ______ '

"CRAP" GAME
LEADS UP TO A
FOUL MURDER
John McCann Beaten
to Death.
RESULT OF A STREET BRAWL
FOUE MEN IMPLICATED IN THE
CRIME.
Cornelius Townsend, Frank Remil- j
lard, Frank Reardon and Edward
Roach Are Under Arrest.
Woman's Statement.
OAKLAND, April 23.â Another murrlrr
has heen added to the record of crime in !
Alameda County as a result of a "crap"
Kame. The body of John McCann, a la
borer, aged 34 years, who resided with
his aged mother at 670 Twenty-eighth
I street, lies on a slab in the Morgue, while
Cornelius Townscnd, a Democratic Coun
ty Central Committeeman from the Sec
ond Ward, together with Frank Remil- j
lard. Frank lteardon and Ed Roach, are
in cells at the City Prison to-night, reg- j
istered on the small book as being impli
cated in the murder.
The murderous row began, It is said, in
j the barber shop of John K. Jacobs, a col
j ored man, at 110"> San Pablo avenue, about
I 5 o'clock this afternoon. All the parties
| above named, with "Jim" Keefe, were
! engaged in shaking dice. During the
"crap" game an abundance of wine and
beer was served, and it appt^rs that Mc
j Cann and Reardon became involved in
! a dispute. Soon blows were struck and
j the game was broken up.
The men Went out on the sidewalk,
j where the battle between Reardon and
! McCann was renewed with fresh vigor
and Reardon was worstod. He was taken
to -Mrs. J. D. Bailey's drug store at 1101
Ban Pablo avenue by Keefe and Town
send, and while his injuries were being
attended to Townsend is said to nave
again attacked McCann In the fataj comr
i bat.
; At this stage Mrs. Nellie R. Ivancovlch,
' who conducts a branch bakery at 1 I<j7 San
Pablo avenue, grabbed Townsend, who,
according to her statement, was "on top,
and commanded him to stop. The nun
separated (<<r a few moments, when thai
fatal blow wa.s struck. McCann was, un
able to rise ami Remlllard and his as
sailant carried him around to a side gate
at the rear of Richard Rademann's sa
loon, corner of Twenty-seventh street and
San I'aliln avenue, laying him down on
.^<>nie sacks, where he Boon breathed his
last. Radernahn, though almost immedi
ately informed of the death, did not re
port the matter until half an hour later,
when he sent word to the Coroner to re
move the body.
The police were finally advised at about
I 6 o'clock, and Sergeant Peterson, with
J Officers Pardee, McKinley andÃeinhardt, j
w:i~ detailed to the Bcene, The closest
secrecy prevailed, however, and the police :
were handicapped for a moment. No one
approached appeared to know any fact;
save that McCann was dead. In the lan- j
guage ef the police, the dragnet was then
thrown out and those who seemed to
know anything were caught in its meshes '
and haled to prison. Among these were
Townsend, Keefe, Roach and Reardon, all
more or less intoxicated. Remtllard was
later arrested at his home on Nineteenth
street, and though he afterward profess. .1
Ignorance, his wife, when Officer McKin
ley called, asked. "Is the man hurt very
badly?" Evidently her husband had tuld
her the Ft"i\v.
At the City Prison none of the men
would discuss the matter, and Townsend
was too much the. worse for liquor to
speak: Detectives Hodgklns, Quigley
and Holland were immediately, given the
case, but in the meantime Sergeant
Peterson had discovered the eye-wit ness,
Mrs. [vancovich, who railed at the City
Prison to-night and positively Identified
Townsend as the man who kicked and
beat McCann.
"1 saw this man Townpond strike? and
i knock McCann down." said Mrs. [van
covich. "Townsend was on top and he
was smashing McCann'S face against the
; curb and upon the rocks in the gutter, at
the same time striking him in the head.
' 1 rushed out and told him to stop.
" 'I can't,' he replied, and then I said,
â¢You must.'
"Il> finally arose and' walked toward
my store, and afterward McCann with
difficulty got up and moved away.
"Oh, i am positive it was Townsend. I
remember his necktie and shirt, though'
he seems more intoxicated now than
j when be was so cruelly beating and kick
ing McCann. I am aware that this is a
great responsibility on my part to iden
tify this man, for it may be a matter of
i life or death to him, but I am positive."
Later another witness in the person of
Albert Sain, a boy residing with his
parents at 1027 San Pablo avenue, was
found, who states that when McCann
1 arose and walked to the corner of
Twenty-seventh street. Townsend again
approached him and struck h|m down.
Then Townsend and RemiHard picked
; him up and carried the man into the back
yard of the saloon.
Keefe is supposed to know more than
; he would divulge to-night, and Jacobs,
| the barber in whose shop the row began,
j could not be found at his home, at 53<t
Seventeenth street.
He was arrested shortly before midnight
by Officers Pardee and McKinley at
Twenty-second street and San Pablo ave
nue. He was very much intoxicated, and
at the City Prison stated that he had
locked his shop after the fighting crowd
left and that he knew nothing of the
I murder. The authorities allowed him to
! 80.
Townsend will probably be charged with
the murder to-morrow, lie is a young
politician, by trade a bricklayer, is" aged
about Xi years, and resided with his wife
and five children at U79 Twenty-sixth
street. T. F. Garrity has been retained J
as his attorney.
John McCann, the murdered man, pre
sents a sorry sight. His left eye is j
swollen black and blue, and his face is j
generally badly beaten. It Is supposed,
too, thai his skull is fractured and his
neck broken, but this cannot be deter
mined until the autopsy is held. The in
quest will be conducted to-morrow night.
The dead man leaves a mother and two
brothers, Andrew and Hugh McCann,
the former a painter and the latter a
gardener. Those who have known him
best say that he was usually a peace
maker and not quarrelsome, though he
was much addicted to the flowing bowl.
FAINTED AWAY WHILE SHE
HELD A LIGHTED LAMP
MISS MAMIE JACKSON NEARLY
BURNED TO DEATH.
The Victim Has No Recollection of
the Accident and Suffered No
Pain While Her Flesh
Was Being Scorched.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, April 23.
Miss Mamie Jackson, 14 years of age,
was nearly burned to death last night at
the Industrial Home, 1817 Everett street.
Conducted by Mrs. M. Fonda. The child
started to retire about 10 o'clock. She car
ii..i a lighted coaloti lamp with her, and
when near the entrance to her bedroom
she apparently fainted and fell backward.
The lamp struck the floor with sufficient
force to smash It into many pieces, scat
tering the blazing coaloil owr the help
less child.
Being unconscious shewas powerless to
make an outcry. The first intimation the
inmates had that Miss Jackson was being
burned was the glare of the blaze from
the burning oil and clothing, which lit up
the hallway leading to her room.
Mrs. Fonda rushed in the direction from
which came the light. Miss Jackson had
rolled over onto her left side and her
clothing on the right side from her head
to her shoetops was almost entirely
burned away. Mrs. Fonda took in the
situation at a glance, and grabbing a
floor rug wrapped it around the unfortu
nate girl and smothered the flames.
Dr. J. M. Young was summoned and
found that the child's flesh on the right
side of her body had been horribly
burned. H# face was also scorched and
much of her hair singed. She was still in
a comatose state when the doctor arrived,
but shortly regained consciousness. Miss
Jackson could give no account of the ac
cident further than that while she was
walking to her room she felt a dizzy sen
sation come over her, and that was her
last recollection of what occurred.
Dr. Young says that while Miss Jack
son's condition is extremely serious he
believes she will recover.

man who about four years ago attempted
to strangle her. Slm screamed for

tered her room. Wilson grabbed

According t â  the police the prisoner Is
a desperate criminal. Some time ago he I
entered th< I Mrs. Griffin, Â« ho
conducts i house on Powell street, near
Kills, and aftei
h Montana cati â  managed to get
away with her â¢ talning a small
amount of money. Subsequently he visit

was asleep. A colored servant discovered
him trying to l<
pectlng something wrong, Bhe asked him
where he wa H<- promptly
knocked her down, and quickly opening
the door disappeared in the darkn<
The victims of the daring crook re
ported their losses to the police and strict
instructions were given to the patrolmen
to arrest him.
While the detectives and policemen
wen- scouring the city for Wilson !â 
ited the disreputable house of Mrs.
rd, at 123 Ellis street, and pretend
ed to be smitten with her charms. While
they wore in a room on the upper Boor
Wilson seised his unsuspecting victim by
the throat and, after almost strangling
her. threw her OV< r the banister to the
floor below. He then entered her private
apartments and Btole $400. The inma
the ).â  â  ng him running downstairs,
attempted to stop him. but were unsuc
cessful. An excellent description of the
man was furnished the police, and from
it they ..ixluded tl â¢ I the mdii
i for whom they had been searching.
Wilson, it is claimed, also won the
fidence i f Mine. Bulehs, at 314 Stockton,
and succeeded in relieving her of her
purs< ci nta Ining f56.
From the description given of the thief
Captain Bohen was satisfied that he was
the Strangler who had murdered several
â women hi Denver as well as in this city.
lit believes that Wilson strangled May
McDermott, who occupied a den on Mor
treet On the night of February 9,
1896, a woman who was friendly with Miss
McDermott knocked at the door of her
house and, laling to get a response, de
tprmlnc<| to force an entrance. (Joing to
the rear Bhe opened the window and saw
the unfortunate woman lying in bed, ap
parently lifeless. She summoned a police
officer who broke open the door. On the
bed lay the inmate dead, with a towel
tightly tied around her neck. An exam
i that she had died from
strangulation.
Several women on the street declared i
that they had seen "a dark man" enter
the house occupied by the murdered
woman a short time before her dead body
was discovered. They described him as
being: of medium height, thick set and
a stubby mustache. He looked like
!iiard, so they claimed, and in fact
might be taken for a negro.
While the detectives were searching; for
the brutal murderer of the unfortunate
woman another outcast in the person of
Bertha Paradis, who occupied a house on
B( rry street, was found dead, having
strangled to death, presumably by the
fiend. As in the case of the Me
'â . woman, there wen of her
who saw "a darh man"
who looked like a negro hastily leave the
house, after the commission of tin brutal
crime.
tain of Detectives Bohen, who was
led to ferret out the mur- i
:ame com lnc< d, alter a short
I h crimea were com-
I by the same man. lie was also
satisfied that t'" -.>r was a mu
latto who managed to keep his identity a
er working on the case for several
months Bohen, satisfied that the mur
â¢ â¢ , gave up all hopes
catching him.
When Wilson was taken to police hend
qarters Thursday night the veteran de
tective at once recognized him from a
description of the "Spaniard" as the man
for whom he had been searching. !)â¢â 
â closelj â  â  .i him. and, failing to s>~-r
:, decided answer from him. he ordered
the detectives to lock him up in the tanks.
Tin- following day Bohen, morally certain
that he is the much wanted strangler,
Hgain questioned him, but failed to draw
from him anything that would tend to
incriminate him.
"Wilson claims that he is a gambler and
admits having been in Denver when sev
eral women were foully murdered. lie
ridicules the suspicion thai he is the
strangler and claims to be able to prove
his Innocence when is is necessary. He
also disclaims any connection with the
murders of the Paradis and McDermott
women.
While convinced that Wilson is the
much wanted strangler. the police have
little hope of convicting him. They, how
ever, intend to book him on at least two
charges of grand larceny in robbing the
women of the tenderloin, and possibly an
;lt to murder in throwing the Leon
ard woman downstairs, provided that she
will const nt to swear to the complaint
against him.

was the liveliest witnessed for a year.
There was music in the air and the per
fume of orange blossoms and spring flow

in;,' banners and floating streamers and
any number of peop^j to see the boys off
fur tluir destination. A long line of gayly
decorated cars had been provided for the
delegates to the Grand Parlor and their

A NOVEL KENNEL.
Italian Greyhounds to Be at the
Bench Show.
The entries for the KenHi Show have
closed with the exception of those mailed
from the country and the East. The re
sults have surpassed the fondest ex
! pectations of the "ommitte.e. It Is,
of course, too soon to give the
classification of breeds; but it may
asserted with safety that this
show will he the largest ever held
west of the Rocky Mountains. It will,
moreover, possess the added attraction of
being the first Western show to witness
I the competition of Eastern cracks with
'â¢ our local dogs.
Mr. Bushnell'S Le Prince Junior will
meet with strenuous opposition In his at
t< mpl to catch the blue ribbon for
Bmooth-coated St. Bernards. The very
best of our rough-coated specimens of
the holy breed will possibly meet with
Waterloo. <>n the other hand, the.
Eastern candidates for honors will not
everything their own way. Verona
kennel's English setter Gladstone TV will
take a l"t of beating, and Alec Truman
thinks thai it will take a mighty smart
downeaster to give him cards and
spades on iri^h setters. Norman D'Eve
â  lyn's Defender, J. B. Martin's Golden
Flash and Rev. J. W. Flinton's Alden
Swagger make a trio of fox terriers to
beat which the East must put up a
mighty pood dog; md if Mrs. Harry
Carlton's Koston terrier Bessie is to be
beaten the Ajthena of America, must send
. its very best representative.
A feature of this show will be the ex
hibition by Mrs. Deane of a kennel of
Italian greyhouds, the only kennel of
: the kind ever seen .it a bench show In
! the United States. This, kennel will un
doubtedly prove a , great attraction to
; all visitors to ttie show, as a chance to
see the like may never recur.
The total number of entries received in
San Francisco amounts to 556. In addi
tion to these the entries taken at the
branch office in Oakland and those in
the mails from the country and the
Easi will probably swell the total to
something over 700.

A NEW HOTEL MAY
RISE FROM THE
BALDWIN ASHES
"Lucky" Trying to Form a
Stock Company.
He Is Planning for a Structure to Cost
Two Million and a Half-The
Two-Story Horror.
IT Is not fo certain after all that there
will not he a magnificent hotel rising
from tho ashes of the old Baldwin.
Despite liis threats to huild an un
i sightly two-story structure ;md maintain
! it in the face of popular clamor, Lucky
j Baldwin is beginning to look around for
I some one to help him in the latest plan
; which his fertile brain has been concoct
ing. He is planning to build a hotel the
. like of which was never seen west of New
York-one which will put the Palace ten
years behind it in grace and comfort and
which will be known wherever travelers
travel or people make a transient home.
The new structure is not an assured
| thing as yet. hut the plan is being
hatched and all the planner wants is help
from some who have money and courage
to form a stock company. If people want
a fine building on the old corner let them
come forward and help out, is what Bald
win says. lie does not want Eastern*
capital; he wants home capital, and if It
is not forthcoming when his stork com
pany is ready to he floated, why then the
Bite of the old hotel can get along with a
I two-story substitute raised 'on what walls
the fire left standing.
The building Baldwin has in his mind is j
a twelve-story pile of brick and stone. It j
will be built around a central court, and :
in this court will be the office. Looking ;
I down Into the oflice from each floor will
in galleries and promenades, and a roof
of glass will be over all. There will be no
theater; Baldwin has had enough of
theaters, hut there will be everything
else. The floors will be of tile with fig
ures in mosaic; the walls will be deco
â  rated with the finest frescoing; the rooms,
1200 of them, will be furnished in the best ;
and most modern style, and the beds will
all be of lacquered iron. The lower stor
ies will be of stone and the remainder
of terra cotta. As planned the building
ggests the facade of the Mills build- 1
the same arch effect being Intro
duced from the lower story up to just
; below the cornice. It will be absolutely
fireproof, well lighted, well aired. It will
cost $2,600,000 to build on the plans of the
millionaire, and he is already trying to
form the company to raise the money.
Such is tli- plan rapidly nearing definite
shape. It is all with an If, however, for
should the stock company Bcheme not
mi i success the old !i]> a "f a two-story
horror may be adopted instead. The two
story building is likely to go up anyway,
but if so it may not remain longer than
until the big building is ready to start,
but if it should happen that the hig
building should not start. Baldwin says
he will be satlfied with what the sma.ll
structure will bring him.
"1 can put up a two-story building for
a few thousand dollars," he reasons,
"and I can get several thousand dollars
a month out of it from stores. I'm sure
it would pay for itself In two months any
way, and then it would make me Inde
pendent and I could look around and see
what I could do toward getting a better
building. I want the people of this city
to heity me, though. If they want a fine
buildinp on that lot they have got to help j
me. i want to form a company and they
can come in and take stock. It will )Â»â  a
good investment, for there is not a better
site for a hotel anywhere in the rlty and
there would be no trouble in realizing on i
it. The people here want too much,
though. They don't want to put their
money into anything that won't pay them
big interest. They could get ?,'â _â¢ or t per
cent out of this; that's as good as Gov
ernment bonds, hut I don't suppose you
can get anything out of this city. I don't
want Eastern capital. [f the "people of
this City want a good building there they
can have it, but they have got to help
build .it."
Report had it that Baldwin had already
proceeded as far as mortgaging enough
of his property to raise a million dollars,
AN EMINENT JURIST
GONE TO HIS REWARD
Ex-Superior Court
Judge James F.
Breen Dies of
Pneumonia After
a Brief Illness.
IN THF death of ex-Superior Court
Judge J:imfs F. Breen, which oc
curred at ii:L'o o'clock yesterday
morning sit his residence, 800
Schroder street. California loses
an eminent jurist and an honored
citizen. For thirty-fUe years the de
ceased wan in public life,' and during
that time besides earning for himself
a. name that was synonymous, for hon
esty. Integrity and fairness, he also
rendered California distinguished sei
vices both upon the bench and in her
legislative halls. Judge Rreen had
hren in declining health fnr over two
years, and about a year ago he broke
up his home in Hollister. and, with
his family, came to San Francisco tÂ° Uve, in hopes tliat he would he bene
fited by the change. On Monday las* tie was taken with an attack of
asthma, which later developed into pneumonia that resulted in his death.
The funeral services will take place about noon to-day, the services hemfr at
St. Agnes' Catholic Church, and the body will lie taken to Hollister for in
terment.
Judge Brccn. who was one of the last survivors of trie Dormer party,
was born January 21, IK4I, near Keokuk, lowa. ]n 1546 his father moved
with his family to the Sacramento Valley, where Judge Breen spent his boy
hood. He entered Santa Clara College In 1557, and graduated with high hon
ors four years latpr. He 'then entered the law office of Clark & Carpentier,
of Pan Francisco, and in 18R2 was admitted to practice in the Supreme
Court. He next returned to San .Tuan and began the practice of his profes
sion. In I^4 he was elected District Attorney, and such an enviable record
did he make while, holding that office and so faithfully did he discharge his
duties that he was re-elected In 1566. Four years later he was elected County
Judge and served In that capacity until 1574, when, San Benito County being
formed from a portion of Monterey County, Judge Breen resigned his office
to remain a resident of San Benito County. Governor Booth then appointed
him Judge of the new county, and at the expiration of his term he declined a
re-election in order to take up the practice of law in Hollister. In 1577 he
was elected to the Assembly, and while representing his county be served
on the Judiciary. Public. Lands and Labor Investigating committees of the
House. Just after the adoption of the new constitution, in 1R79. Judge
Breen was elected Superior Judge, and was re-elected in ISB4 and IS9O. At
the expiration of his second term he resigned on account of his health and
in order to look after hla landed interests in the San Juan Valley.
In 1870 Judge Breen married Miss Kate Mcftlahon, whose father was one
of the pioneers, and she with two daughters, Margaret and Grace, survive
him.
The news of Judge Breen'a death was received with profound expressions
of sorrow. He was well known all over California, and had a host of
friends, who admired and respected him for his many sterling qualities. He
was a member of the Catholic church.
hut he says the only money he has In
sight is the proceeds from the sale of
some property which will net him $50,000.
With this, he says, he intends to start in
on the two-story building and get that
Into shape as soon as possible. That done,
he will go to work on his stock company.
There are also well-defined reports that
Baldwin is anxious to sell the old hotel
site, but it is a big piece of property and
the old man does not wish to cut it up.
If he sells it at all he wants the whole
thing to go together, hut if he can get
his stock company going there will be no
necessity for selling it.
His plans are still indefiniteâ all hut" the
two-story buildingâ but whether that wlil
be a temporary or a permanent structure
remains to he seen. If it should give
place to such a building as the million
aire is now planning the tire will not have
been altogether in vain.
ON OAKLAND LINKS.
Nine Players Qualify to Enter the
Captain's Cup Contest.
On Saturday afternoon the qualifying:
competition for the captain's cup took
place on the links of the Oakland Golf
club. The cup is a handsome silver
trophy presented by Orestos Pierce, cap
tain of the club, and is competed for
I semi-annually, the -winner gaining the
honor 'of having- his name engraved
thereon. A week before the actual cup
competition takes place a qualifying com
petition is held, no player making a
higher average than 50 for nine holes
over the short course, or than 55 for
nine holes over the long course, being
eligible for the cup contest. The follow
ing players qualified with the following
averages: W. P. Johnson and J. C.
McKee, 43: .1. M. Taft, 46; .7. A. Folger,
47; E. R. Folger, 48; G. D. Greenwood,
48; C. P. Hubbard, 19; R. A. Cooke. 50â
all over the short course. D. F. Belden
qualified with a score cf 55 over the long
course.
Next Saturday. April 29, the above
named will be entitled to take part in
the competition for the captains cup,
which was won six months ago by E.
R. Folger with an average of 45 per
round.
It has not been settled where the tie
between the Oakland and San Francisco
Golf Clubs will be played off, the choice
lying between the Burlingame, San Ra
fael and Del Monte courses. The San
Rafael course is hardly ready for play,
as no one competent to direct its lay
ing out has been in charge of it, and it
is felt that Burlingame In its soil and
general nature too closely resembles the
Presidio links to be strictly neutral. Sev
eral of the San Francisco players, too,
are members of the Burlingame Club, and
so are familiar with the course. Thus the
Del Monte links seem to be the only. ones
that meet the requirements of the case,
and it will probably be decided to play
here.
