Special fable to The Call and th> New York
Herald. Copyrighted, 1599, by James Gor
don Bennett.
M I LA. April 28.âColo
nel Arguelles and Lieuten
ant Bernal, the members
of the insurgent General Luna's
staiT who came through the
American lines near Calumpit
this morning, arrived in Manila
this afternoon to consult with
General Otis regarding peace ne
gotiations. They report that
Aguinaldo is at San Isidro.
In an interview which I had
with General Otis at the former
Spanish Governor's palace in
acanan the American com
mander said:
"The insurgents
thought their posi
tion on the river
bank at Calumpit
was impregnable.
There they made a
successful stand
against the Span
iards in 1896.
"Our success in
storming their very
strong entrench
ments has demoral
ized them, and the
people are ready to
give up the fight.
"As to the emissaries which
have been sent by General Luna,
my opinion is that they desire to
gain time.
"They say they wish to submit
the question of continuing the
war to their Congress, meeting
in May. These leaders think
that they represent the Filipino
people.
"I answered that 1
would be glad to re
ceive emissaries
from the insurgent
chiefs, provided
they came with a
proposition for ab
k solute surrender.
These were the only
terms that I could
consider.
"The emissaries would not
agree to this, as they thought it
contrary to the dictates of honor.
The emissaries added that if
peace was forced upon them it
would not be permanent.'*
The Filipino refugees are all
gathered at San Fernando. The
insurgent soldiers are looting
and are said to be in a state of
mutiny. Peasants in large num
bers are returning to their homes
within our territory.
New telegraphic connections
with General Lawton by way of
Bocave were completed to-night.
The insurgents attacked the
Americans at Naguig yesterday,
killing two of our men and
wounding twelve. They were I
subsequently repulsed by five

companies of the First Washing
ton and three companies of the
Twelfth Infantry. There are in
dications that a considerable
force of the enemy is gathered
in that vicinity. The insurgents
are constructing breastworks on
the shore of Laguna de Rai and
have one piece of artillery mount
ed. Several Macabeles came
through the lines yesterday after
noon and asked for American
protection. They want ( ieneval
Mac Arthur to occupy San Fer
nando, where they report that
the insurgents are looting and
destroying property.
FILIPINOS' ADVANCES
HAVE BEEN FRUITLESS
MANILA, April 28.-The Filipino ad
vances for peace at terms which would
b>- in any way advantageous to Aguin
aldo have been fruitless. Colonel Man
uel Arguelezes and Lieutenant Jose
Rernal, who came into General Mac-
Arthurp lines under h flag of truce, told
General Otis that they were represen
tatives '>f General Luna, who had been
requested by Agulnaldo to ask for a
cessation of hostilities in order to al
low time for the summoning of the Fil
ipino congress, which body would <i>-
cide whether the people wanted peace.
General otis rr-pli^d he did
no* recognize the existence <>f the Fili
pino government. Thf-rÂ«' will b"
another conference, to-morrow.
The Filipino officers walked down the
railroad track to the Kansas regiment's
outpost at 9 o'clock this morning. The
Kansas captain in command there es
corted them to General AVhfatnn's
headquarters, where they were pro
vided with horses and s.-nt to the head
quarters of General HacArthur. The
hitter invited the Filipinos to sit down
at lunch with him and conversed with
them for some time. lie refused, how
ever, to speak authoritatively on the
subject of their errand, referring all in
quiries to General Otis. The Filipinos
were then escorted by Major Malloney
of General Mao Arthur's staff to Ma
nila, reaching this place at 3 p. m.
General Otis' aid. Lieutenant Sladen,
was awaiting their arrival at the d< poi
with a carriage, in which they were
driven to the palace entrance. The
Filipino officers attracted much atten
tion. They were dressed in uniforms
of checked blue and white cloth and
wore straw hats. They carried no side
arms. They were escorted directly to
the office of General Otis. Jacob B.
Schurman, president of the Philippine
Commission, and Hon. Charles Denby,
a member of the commission, soon
joined the party there. The news of
the arrival of Filipino officers under a
flag of truce spread through the city
rapidly and many officers gravitated
SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, APRIL 29, 1899.
[ to the corridors of the palace, while a
: crowd of native's gathered in the square
; opposite.
At f> o'clock the two Filipino officers.
escorted by Lieutenant Sladen and
Major Malloney, left the palace. They
did not look at all elated as a result
of their meeting with C.-eneral Otis and
the members of the Filipino Commis
sion.
In offering to submit a peace propo
sition to his so-called Congress Agui
naldo hopes by subterfuge to overcome
General otis' consistent policy of ig
noring the Filipino Government. The
Filipinos' argument is that it is im
possible to arrange an armistice with
out tho sanction of the Congress.
General <Â»tis punctured this assump
tion to-day by asking, the emissaries
if General Aguinaldo could make war
without the sanction of Congress, why
he could not stop without reference to
that body?
Whil<- the insurgents are undoubted
ly tired of war, the loaders are torn
with dissensions. There is ;i suspicion
that it was hoped by means of a con
ferehce to ascertain what they could
expect. If they saw that anything was
to he gained by continuing the war, an
armistice would afford them an oppor
tunity for recuperating their demoral
ized forces.
It is an- interesting commentary upon
Aguinaldo's proposition that only sixty
of the 300 members of the Filipino <'on
gress have taken the oath of allegi
ance which their constitution requires.
A Filipino proclamation replying to
the proclamation of the American
Commissioners has appeared. It is
signed by Mabini for the President and
is dated at Caniasdro, April 15. It is
in the usual grandiose style, and de
clares that President McKinley Issued
the proclamation in order to force the
American Congress to ratify the ces
sion of the islands under the treaty of
Paris.
"This contract Of cession was made
with the Spanish after Spanish domina
tion had been ended by the valor of our
troops," the writer asserts. The procla
mation complains that the Filipinos
were not represented at Paris during
the negotiation of the treaty and that
they are without assurances of the ful
fillment of American promises. It di
lates upon the alleged Anglo-Saxon
hatred of blacks, and asserts a desire
to enslave them. Deploring a lack of
foreign aid in prosecuting the war the
proclamation concludes:
"We stand alone, but we will fight j
to the death. Coming generations will
pray over our graves, shedding tears
of gratitude for their freedom."
Yesterday furnished addei proof that
the T T Tiited States troops have a fear
of bushwhacking that is above their
fears cf battle. The Washington Regi
ment, which is holding Taguig with
three companies of the Twelfth regu
lars, engaged a large force of insur
gents in a fight in the jungle. The
Americans lost two killed and ten
wounded.
The Filipinos have been massing at
the lake mouth of the Pasig River, and
it is estimated that there are 2000 of
them now there. They have mounted
two gunsâ one a three-inch Krupp â
and have thrown' a number of shells
into the American lines. The gunboat
Rapldan, which is guarding the en
trance to the river, shelled a launch
which was carrying supplies.
Yesterday a large force of rebels ap
proached the town, seemingly bent on
luring the Americans from <'alumpit.
Three companies of the Washington
troops sallied from the town and
attacked the natives and found that
they had their hands full. Two other
companies of the Washingtons and
three of the Twelfth regulars rein
forced them and drove back the
enemy, who removed their dead and
Wounded as they retired, as usual.
AGUINALDO MUST ACCEPT
PEACE AT OUR TERMS
XEW YORK, April 28.â The Heralds
correspondent Bends the following: "it
is the beginning of the end. When the
enemy stops righting and wants to
talk it is a pretty good sign that he is
liokod."
This is the general view of the ad
ministration as expressed tn me to-day
hy Adjutant General Corhirt and sub-
Btahtially to the same effect by other
members of the War Department of the
cablegram received from General Otis
this morning Riving the result of yes
terday's battle at Calumpit.
The authorities are jubilant over the
turn affairs have taken, and predict
the surrender of Aguinaldo within for
ty-eight hours. The report that the
Filipino emissaries left the conference
with the American commander and
< 'omtnissioners at Manila discouraged
over the reply they received to the re
quest that hostilities cease until the
Filipino congress can pass upon the
question of peace does not alarm offi
cials here.
The mere fact that Aguinaldo has be
gun to sue for peace is considered tan
tamount to saying he will, after a lit
tle dickering, accept peace at our
terms.
Speculation is already rife here as
to the conditions which will be grant
ed. I obtained to-day from a high
source this statement regarding the
position of the administration with re
spect to the Filipinos:
"Negotiations for peace will be con
ducted by the Philippine Commission
and not by General Otis alone. Before
negotiations can be begun the Filipinos
will be required to lay down their arms.
"When they have given this evidence of
their intention to abandon them the
War Commission will be authorized to
announce to them the intentions of the
Government.
"There is no disposition on the part
of the President to punish Aguinaldo
or any other Filipino. The insurgent
leader will be treated like any other
native. Should he desire a special
treaty for himself or indicate that he
is not getting all he desires he will
be invited to leave the country. The
other Filipinos will, be invited to re
sume their peaceful avocations and will
GILLMORE AND PARTY
PRISONERS OF WAR
It Is Reported That the Men Who
Landed From the Yorktown Are
Held by Insurgents at Baler.
MANILA, April 28. â General Otis has been informed that Lieutenant Gillmore and his par
ty of sailors from the Yorktown are alive and are being held as prisoners of war by the in
surgents at Baler, where they were captured. If this information proves correct the party
will undoubtedly be turned over to Admiral Dewey upon the conclusion of an armistice.
ON April 19 the Navy Department
at Washington gave out the fol
lowing corrected cablegram from
Admiral Dewey:
MANILA, April IK.â Secretary of the
Navy, Washington: The Yorktown vis
ited Baler, on the east coast of Luzon,
P. 1., April 12 for the purpose of rescuing
and bringing away the Spanish forces,
consisting of eighty soldiers, three officers
and twi-i priests, which were surrounded
by 40i) insurgents. Some of the insurgents
were armed with Mauser rifles, as report
ed by natives. Lieutenant J. C. Gillmore,
while making an examination of the
mouth of the river in an armed boat, was
ambushed, fired upon and captured. Fate
unknown, as insurgents refused to com
municate afterward. The following are
missing: The officer previously referred
to, Chief Quartermaster W. Walton, Cock
swain J. Ellsworth. Gunner's Mate H. J.
Hygard, Bailmaker'a Mate Vendgit, Sea

be treated with consideration by the
American forces."
When American supremacy is estab
lished in the island of Luzon the au
thorities think there will be a prompt
collapse of the revolt in the island of
Panay. Natives of other Philippine
islands have been watching with k"i n
interest the course of affairs in Luzon,
and as they have been stirred up by
Aguinaldo's emissaries the defeat' of
Aguinaldo and his army will un
doubtedly have a good effect through
out the archipelago.
After concluding peace with Agui
naldo's army the commission will ar
range for visiting other islands to con
fer with the natives concerning re
forms they desire and to determine the
character of legislation for the. govern
ment of the islands which should te
recommended to the President for pre
sentation to Congress.
The terms which will be offered to the
Filipinos will not differ materially from
those stated in the recent proclamation
issued by the commission. The comm
ission then declared the Philippine
people would be granted the largest lib
erty and self-government reconcilable
with the maintenance of a wise, Just,
effective and economical administration
of public affairs and compatible with
the sovereign rights and obligations of
the United States. Civil rights of the
Filipinos will be granted to the fullest
extent. Religious freedom will be as
sured and all persons will have equal
standing before the law.
While in sonic quarters there is a
disposition to think that th- 1 Filipinos
have made this move simply to gain
time, high officials think the action of
Aguinaldo is due to the fact that he
and his troops have had enough ol
fighting American forces.
As General Otis has undoubtedly re
fused the armistice requested, it is ap
parent that Aguinaldo has really lost
ONE OF THE OLD GUNS USED BY FILIPINOS AGAINST THE AMERICANS.
Accompanying this there was pub
lished the following press dispatch:
MANILA, April 10. 4:30 p. m.â Admiral
Dewey has been notified of the strange
disappearance of J. C. Uillmore and four
teen members of the crew of the United
States gunboat Yorktown. On Saturday
last the STorktown anchored off Baler, on
the east coast of the Island of Luzon and
about 200 miles from here, where then
was a Spanish garrison of about tifty
men, which had been defending itself
against several hundred Filipinos foi
months past.
Lieutenant <si!lmore. Ensign W. H.
Standley and a boat's crew were sent
up the river from Baler Bay to communl
ciate with the Spaniards, the town of Ba
ler being situated some distance inland.
Ensign Standley, who landed at the
mouth of the river, reports that h>- heard
three volleys, a bugle call and cheers
from up the river, but that the automatic
gun which was part ot tne equipment of
tin- boat was not heard firing. Standley
later paddled to the forktown in a canoe.
A search was made for the Yorktown'a
boat and her crew, but no trace of them
waa found, and the Yorktown sailed for
by his course, for the reason that the
moral effeel of his attempt to obtain
peace will be great throughout the ar
chipelago. For this reason the author
ities believe that the insurgents are
sincere in their desire for peace.
Secretary Alger paid as the depart
ment closed that, while it could not be
said that peace was assured, he regard
ed the prospects as of the brightest and
felt confident that the end of the in
surrection was near. To his mind
there would be a repetition of the ne
gotiations which were had before San
tiago. The Secretary left Washington
to-night for a ten days' trip in the
West, and it gave him great satisfac
tion to leave affairs in such promising
shape.
Everybody is praising the volunteers.

General Corbin said that every vol
unteer who participated in the fighting
in the Philippines since peace was de- j
clared should have a medal of honor.
By the terms of their enlistments they
were entitled to withdraw from' the ser
vice, but they remained voluntarily,
performing more than was required of
them, which was more than the ordi
nary duty of a soldier.
It is expected that to-morrow there
will be further negotiation with the in
surgent representatives.

reported to Dewey his theories that the
Filipinos had captured or sunk the boat,
or thai the Spaniards had rescued the

Later the statement was published
that Admiral Dewey did not know
whether his men had fallen Into the

The Spanish garrison at Baler, it ap

VOLUNTEERS AS ALLIES
OF THE ADMINISTRATION
NEW YORK, April 28.â A Washing
ton special t" the Herald says: Presi
dent McKinley and the administration
have been relieved of a great load of
anxiety by the appan nt collapse of the
Philippine Insurrection. They have
hoped for an early termination of rh"
foniiict with Aeruinaldn not only be
cause it would stop the shedding or
blood and would relieve them of the
necessity for calling for more volun
teers, but because it meant much to the
administration and the party politi
cally.
The restoration of peare would en
able the President to turn the Philip
pine problem over to Congress in De
cember in much better shape than
would have been possible had the war
still been soing- on. By that time he
will have put into operation under
military authority a form of govern
ment which the Philippine Commission
will have "recommended. He will have
the report of that commission and be
able to give Congress valuable infor
mation as to tin' situation in the
islands and the capabilities of the peo
ple for self-government.
There is no doubt that this commis
sion will report in favor of the United
States retaining: the islands indefi
nitely, and such a policy will be much2
better received by tho country with
peace restored and trade beginning to
develop than would be the case with a
war in progress and more soldiers be
ing sent to the front.
Returned volunteers arc expected to
be strong allies of the administration in
the policy of retaining the islands. They
Will be treated with the greatest con
sideration, and every one of them will
be proud Of the part he has taken in
wresting the islands from the Spanish
and subduing the rebellious natives.
They will not. it is believed, favor any
proposition to abandon the fruits of
their valor.

OF AMERICAN ATROCITIES

In answer to a cablegram of inquiry he

none of the incidents referred to by
Brenner have ever been brought to his
attention, and that he has been unable
thus far to find any foundation for the re
ports. He states, however, that he will
continue the Investigation.

CONTRACT LABOR
SYSTEM RESTORED
Hawaii Is Open to the
Coolies.
HONOLULU. April 22.â 0n the 17th
President Dole and his Cabinet decided
i not to allow any additional contract
| laborers to come into the country. This
] decision was arrived at after several
I conferences had been held with the
! planters. In the meantime word has
! been received from Washington which
j restores the old order of things and
j now the planters may import as many
| laborers as they may require.
By the Nippon Maru President Dole
received a note from the Treasury De
partment stating that the annexation
i resolution did not and does not effect
j the labor system of this country, and
! that the same remains in force and
I effect until such time as Congress may
j enact laws changing it. The present
! applications for contract Japanese for
I the new plantations will be approved
i by the Government and forwarded by
I the next steamer.
President Dole this morning admitted
the receipt of an official decision from
i Washington in favor of the old labor
: system.
"Yes," added the Preside/it, "the let
i ter reopens the matter. We will have
i a meeting as soon as possible with the
planters and inform them of the
i changtd situation."
Asked if the situation was not now
| identical with that before the Hawaiian
Cabinet had formed its recent opinion,
! the President replied:
"Yes; probably. That is the point
upon which we wish to see the planters.
, It may still seem advisable to impose
\ some restrictions."
The Government to-day decided to
) address a letter to the planters asking
1 them to file applications for such labor
as they require.
Between 300 and 400 Japanese immi-
I grants arrived on the America Maru
i to-day. They come to enter into labor
j contracts under* permission given by
the Government.
It is understood that the policy of
] the planters with respect to the future
1 will be about as follows: A gradual
reduction of the use of contract Asiatic
| labor and a corresponding Introduction
! of free American help Into the cane
! fields. The delay in the application of
I American laws will enable the planters
to adopt American labor rules by de
grees, and will insure the country
against the damaging effects of a sud
den change. Colonel Whyte's project
for bringing in American labor will re
ceive early attention. There probably
will be a company, known as the Amer
'â¢ lean Labor Supply Company, or some
i thing very similar, backed by the plan
i tation agencies. It is hoped that with
i in a few months this concern will have
j its labor channels thoroughly opened,
| and that by December it will be in a
position to supply all the workmen re-
I quired.

GAGE LOOKS OUT
FOR HIS LAMBS
Rewards for Supporters
of Burns.
Special Dispatch, to The Call. -
LOS ANGELES, April That Colonel
Dan M. Burns is in absolute control of the
'patronage of the Republican party, of Cal
ifornia and that those who were elected
to office last November must take coun
sel with him was made evident to-day to
all office-seekers when George Washing
ton Root of San Francisco, clerk of the
Supreme Court, announced that Harold
G. Simpson of Pasadena had been chosen
as the Los Angeles County deputy clerk
of the court. The appointee is .the son
of Senator C. M. Simpson of Pasadena.
The contest for this uillet has been very
keen as it pays $150 a month for four
years The leading candidates, aside from
Simpson, were John Hughes and Frank
Dominguez, both prominent in the local
"push, and who were. In the front In the
Gage ranks. . Â
When Simpson boasted, on the day he
disregarded his county delegation's In
! structions and voted for Burns, that he
â¢ had been cared for his friends thought the
statement was a burst of humor, but now
he is enjoying loaves and fishes. As Sen
ator Simpson at the time of casting his
vote for Burns was entering upon his new
four-year term, he has nothing further to
ask from his constituency, as his -own
term and that of his son will expire about
the same time.
Harold G. Simpson, Â«he appointee, is
probably the youngest man who ever held
a similar position anywhere. He is only
23 years old, but is said to be exceptional
ly capable. Young Simpson was chief bill
filer in the Senate during the recent legis
lative session. He will take charge of the
office on May 1.
W. M. Ward, who has been in the office
temporarily, will leave In about two
weeks for San Francisco, which is his
permanent station.
GERMANY SATISFIED
REGARDING SAMOA
BERLIN, April 28.â The newspapers
here, commenting to-day on the latest
news from Samoa, express satisfaction
with the attitude of Admiral Kautz, U.
S. N., interpreting It aa a sign that the
United States Government will hence
forth side with Germany In the Samoan
troubles. The Boersen Courier says that
the American admiral's position may indi
cate how differently the Americans and
the English in Samoa Interpret Instruc
tions received simultaneously.
The Neusten Nachrichten notes "with
lively satisfaction" the loyal attitude of
the Washington Government "In admon
ishing Admiral Kautz in relation to his
letter to his cousin in the United States."
It is believed here that an understand
ing has been reached between the Gov
ernments of the United States and Ger
many not only as to their relations in
Samoa but In regard to other portions of
the world as well. Some of the Berlin
newspapers to-day condemn a speech
made recently by the United States Con
sul at Amsterdam, George C. Correy, in
which it was said that from the year 1868
Prince Bismarck had been constantly
scheming to seize Holland. The North
German Gazette, commenting on this as
sertion, says that the United States seems
to pick out singular specimens of man
kind for diplomatic posts.

PERKINS` FRIENDS
ARE GAGE'S FOES
Result of the Attack on
the Senator.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, April 28.â Governor
Henry T. Gage came to Los Angeles for a
few moments to-day and remained be
hind locked doors. He granted an audi
ence to a few persons, and His friends say
the executive is employing most of his
time while at the Downey Ranch making
out commissions for the new State offi
cers whom he will soon name. These
friends also state that he probably will
pay no attention to the suggestion of W.
H. Mills to return the moneys appropriat
ed for the Paris exposition into the treas
ury by appointing no commissioners. It
is asserted that Gage does not appreciate
the position taken by Mills, nor does he
admire the opinion Mills sets forth with
out consultation.
The uncalled-for reference to United
States Senator Perkins by Governor Gage
in his address at the San Pedro harbor
celebration is still the topic of conversa
tion in political circles and has momen
tarily crowded to the rear the prospective
nomination of Dan Burns to the United
States Senate In this Gage-Perkins con
troversy it is claimed by the supporters of
U. S. Grant here that the Northern Sen
ator has acquitted himself with signal
ability. On the other hand, the friends of
Gage applaud the Governor for what they
consider a merited rebuke of the course
pursued by Senator Perkins. Between
these two lines stand the independent cit
izen and the executive committee of the
Free Harbor Jubilee, who, according to
statements heard on the streets, believe
Governor Gage erred in judgment when
he. as an Invited speaker, permitted per
sonal grievances to becomi th.' essence of
his address and seized the opportunity to
administer a rebuke to one who had been
foremost in the battle for the success of
a free harbor at San Pedro. Ir is said by
those who carefully weight things polit
ical that whenever the appointment of
Burns conies before the United States
i Senate Senator Perkina will be found ar
rayed against the Republican State ma
: chine.
It was said to-day that as soon as Brig
! adier General H. G. Otis arrives next
week he will be appron died by an emis
, Â»ary from the Republican State machine,
' who is also ;i mutual friend of Colonel
I Burns. Governor <;;ik.' and the Times ed

SURGEON'S MISTAKE
BLINDS A PATIENT
Remove a Sound Eye prom o
Boy Instead of One That
Was Sightless.
MONTREAL, April 28.â Seven years ago, Thomas Stewart, then 10
years old, lost the sight of one eye, the blade of a penknife having
been accidentally run into it. Dr. Alexander Froudfoot attended him.
Recently Dr. Proudfoot advised the removal of the useless eye as the
only means of preserving the other intact. This was agreed to and the
delicate task was entrusted to Dr. Proudfoot, who is assistant oculist
and aurist to the general hospital.
The operation took place at the family residence and at its conclu
sion it was found a terrible mistake had been madeâ the healthy eye had
been removed. On recovering from the effects of the anesthetic the
patient found himself blind.
ENTOMBED ALIVE
BY CAVING EARTH
Horrible Fate of Three
Well-Diggers.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CLARKS STATION, New, April 28.â
Three of a gang of workmen which had
been repairing a well 100 yards from the
j station here were buried at 8 o'clock
this morning beneath fifteen or twenty
feet of earth and timbers by the giving
way of the curbing. The soil is very
Bandy, and as some braces were re
moved for the purpose of putting in a
new curbing, the entire structure at the
top gave way, the men falling to the
bottom, with caved-in earth and broken
timbers on top of them. Immediately
i after the accident a rapping on the iron
! pip^ which extends from the surface to
\ the oottom could be heard, showing
that at least one of the unfortunates
was still alive. A special train with
forty laborers^ and two physicians was
hurried from Reno, but before it ar
rived the rapping had ceased.
The work of digging out the well was
hurried throughout the day, and at 6
6'clock this evening the rescuers were
within four feet of the imprisoned men.
As water was struck during the after
noon, and as the steam pump which
was put into operation this afternoon
cannot keep puce with the fast-rising
water, there is no possibility that any
of the entombed men are now alive.
This evening quicksand was encoun
tered and digging operations ceased
while new curbing and walling were
being constructed. At a lute hour to
night the force had resumed digging
! and will keep steadily at it until th"
bodies are reached.
The victims* are John Downey, a
Scotchman, aged about 30. who had a
brother in Minneapolis, Minn., and a
sister in Scotland; Robert A. Fairburn
(Or Fairbairn). who had a wife and
family in Oak Park. Sacramento; Man

THE DISHONEST CHINESE PASSENGER TRAFFIC OF THE PACIFIC MAIL
THspatches received from Washington
last night throw a new and startling
light upon the secret causes of the dis
missal of R. E. Meredith as chief of
the Chinese Bureau of this city. Mere
dith was discharged from his posi
tion of trust for cause. The Call, in its
endeavor to remedy the glaring abuses
of the Chinese Bureau, exposed the
methods of Meredith, and to-day it will
expose the powerful corporations which
stood sponsor for Meredith in his ma
nipulations. The Chinese Bureau of
this city is the only practical barrier
on the Pacific Coast to the uninter
rupted influx of Chinese coolies to the
United States.
The officers of the bureau are ex
pected to be honest, efficient and vigi
lant. In their hands rests the vitally
important duty of enforcing the exclu
sion act and of preventing the degrad
ed laborers of the Orient from enter
ing the port of San Francisco. Mere- j
dith, the chief of the bureau, was dis- I
missed from the service of the Federal '
Government because he was found j
grossly negligent of his sworn duties.
The Call will show to-day that the j
Southern Pacific Company, C. P. Hunt- !
ington, the Pacific Mail Steamship \
Company and R. P. Schwerin were the i
pupporters and sponsors of Meredith, j
his close friends while in office and his j
persist. nt defenders while in disgrace.
The officers of the Southern Pacific
Company and of the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company exercised every j
influence within their power to restore j
Meredith to his position after iv had
been discharged.
They appealed to John P. Jackson, j
Collector of th Port, and secured his
unqualified indorsement of Meredith, in
character and ability. An effort was
made at Washington to induce the Sec
retary of the Treasury to reconsider
his decision of dismissal. Paid lobby
ists of the Southern Pacific Company
and of the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany were ordered to use their seduc
tive .'ins upon Federal officials at
Washington and if possible save Mere
dith from dismissal. An .appeal was
even made to President McKinley him- :
self to save from final discharge this
officer whose duty it was to keep Chi
nese out and not to let them in.
The cause of this campaign to save
.-. petty official from dismissal, the mo
tives of telegrams', letters and vehement
personal instruction. might, by a
stretch of the imagination, b,e a mys
tery. But R. P. Schwerin, the protege
and beneficiary of the bounty of C. P.
Huntingtoh"; gives the reason. The
Pacific Mail Steamship Company profits
by the illegitimate traffic in Chinese
coolies. It reaps an ill-gotten harvest
in freights and fares from coulies that
by legislative enactment are barred
from an entrance into the United
States.
Every Chinese who is brought from
China to this port and is then denied a
landing becomes a burden upon the
Pacific Mail. Every Chinese who comes
and. rightly or wrongly, is permitted
to enter is an element of profit to the
corrupt corporation that lives to make
money at whatever cost to the people
it preys upon. The Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company has been and is in
volved in an illegitimate Chinese
traffic. Any measure which Interferes
with that traffic is. to tile officers of
the Pacific Mail, an affront and a tres
pass upon their vicious rights. And
when B. E. Meredith was removed from
his position as chief of the Chinese
Bureau R. P. Schwerin wrote to C. P.
Huntington in New York:
"You must have Meredith rein
stated. His removal means a body
blow at the Chinese passenger traffic
of the Pacific Mail Company."
And C P. Huntington replied:
"I will do all I can."
And C. P. Huntington did all he could
to save the Chinese passenger traffic
of the Pacific Mail. He had advocated
Chirfse immigration before and after
the United States Government prohib
ited this terrible influx of coolies into
American territory. He had championed
the cause of degraded hordes of cheap
laborers because that cause meant
profit to him. He had used his steam
ship line as a vehicle with which to
cheat Federal laws and injure Amer
ican workingmen. When his lieutenant
pounded the alarm . C. P. Huntington
needed no second warning. He at once
communicated with his agents at
Washington.
Letters between Huntington and
Schwerin passed in quick succession.
The wires were laid and Huntington
sÂ«Â»on issued his orders to David A.
Chambers, one of the paid "attorneys"
of the Southern Pacific company at
Washington. Mr. chambers was not
flow to act, and in the following dis
patch he tells what he did and how be
tried to save B. E. Meredith from the
ax of official decapitation:

allied powers of corruption, are en
l in using their tremendous power
to defeat the purpose of the exclusion
act and to Hood th<> country with coolie
laborers. The dispatch shows also that
Collector Jackson will have nothing to
do with the administration of a depart
ment that has been frequently sullied
by scandal and mismanagement since
its establishment. The history of Mere
dith's regime in the Chinese Bureau,
may indicate in a measure why C.
P. Huntington and R. P. Sohwerin were
so anxious to have him retained in of
fice.
The final turning down of Meredith
and his backers, the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company, collector Jackson
and other of kindred sentiment by the
Secretary of the Treasury, will be hail
ed with delight by all the friends of la
bor in the T'nited States, particularly
on the Pacific Coast, louring the period
of two years in which the affairs of t h â 
Chinese Bureau were "managed" by
Meredith and Jackson the number of
Chinese immigrants, including those
returning t<> this State, jumped to a
figure more than double that under
Wise's administration, even when Dick
Williams stood at the gates and made a
fortune for himself and his pals out of
the business of being a member of the
Chinese Bureau.
It is noteworthy that about the first
official act of Customs Collector Jack
son on assuming his office was the an
nouncement to the members of the
press that he had confirmed Mr. Wise's
appointment of R. E. Meredith as chief
of the Chinese Rureau. and it is equally
noteworthy that during the two years
of Mr. Jackson's administration of the
Chinese Bureau Mr. Schwerin and the
other officials and friends of the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company felicitated
themselves when they read in the daily
papers that the number of Chinese im
migrants arriving and settling in Cali
fornia had Increased from 1700 annu
ally, which was the number under the
Wise administration, to 3500 annually
under the Jackson-Meredith adminis
tration. It is a fact equally noteworthy
that since the Secretary of the Treas
ury kicked Meredith out of office, the
business of the Chinese brokers has
fallen away to a minimum.
Certain lawyers who almost made
the bureau their home when Mr. Mere
dith was there have disappeared from
the Appraisers' building and are look
ing for Caucasian clients. Certain at
taches of other offices in the same
building who were wont to go into the
vault and examine papers in Chinese
cases every day are now conspicuous
by the rarity of their presence. The
lodgings maintained by the steamship
company in the Mail dock for
housing Chinese immigrants await
ing a landing are no longer
overcrowded, and the abuse of
keeping those unfortunate creatures
six months on the dock before being
granted a hearing has been stopped.
But it is noteworthy, also, that the
abuse was not abated by any initiatory
step taken by Jackson or his friend
Meredith. It was done at the sugges
tion of Special Agents Linck and
Smith, who, when they arrived here
and looked into the matter of the gross
mismanagement of the Chinese Bureau,
made such representations as to bring
about a general and speedy clearing up
of the Mongolian debris.
The laborers of California owe a
debt of gratitude to the firmness and
clearsightedness of the Secretary of the
Treasury, who refused to be influenced
by a great corporation and who was
too shrewd to be misled by the lies told
both here and in Washington in Mere
dith's behaif to waver for an instant
in adopting heroic measures to protect
the people of the United States from
this flood of yellow paupers coming in
through the Golden Gate at the rate of
have fallen until the necessity for or
ganization again asserted itself, and
again combinations were formed.
Some time ago the Pine Manufactur
ers' Association was formed in this
city. The organization was established
by several of the more influential firms,
and as usual the organizers overlooked
the importance of firms that were not
taken Into the compact.

nearly 4000 per annum. The first of
these measures and one that brought
consternation to the coolie brokers was
the appointment of Chinese Interpreter
Hey. John Endlcott Gardiner, D. D., as
a < "hinese inspector. Gardiner was the.
last man in the world that Jackson or
Meredith wanted to see in the bureau.
Meredith had spoken in the most con
temptuous manner about him and to
him on one occasion threatening, phy
sically to kick him out of the office.
Jackson was known to have a dispar
aging opinion of the reverend gentle
man also. Inspector Lynch was equally
disliked by Meredith, and although
Lynch and Gardiner had been the two
most active and successful members of
Leading Figures in the Expose of the Pacific Mail.

the bureau, Jackson refused to appoint
either one to the head of the bureau
when the place was vacated. The cold
shoulder extended to the inspectors
namedmight be interpreted, in the ab
sence of a more plausible theory, as
an Intimation that virtue was to
be its own sweet solitary reward in
the bureau. In other words, that Gar
diner and Lynch had got themselves
disliked because they were too zealous
ia the discharge of their duties.
Hence the totally unexpected ap
pointment of Dr. Gardiner to a position
where he would be untrammeled in the
discharge of those duties with which
he had been intrusted- was a bitter dose
for the coolie ring. It also revealed the
ly but effectively and they have won
their reward in seeing the first mate
rial signs of disintegration in the ex
cluslve association. The Pine Manu
facturers' Association met a few days
ago to discuss the affairs of its mem
berg. Trouble had been brewing and
an effort was made to silence the dis
content, Outside firms had been cut
ting prices and securing trade which
the members of the association believed
beLonged to them.
At the meeting held to consider the
matter the following firms were repre
sented: Tacoma Mill Company, Pope
& Talbot, D. H. Bibb Lumber Company,
E. K. Wood Lumber Company, Renton,
Holmes & Co., E. B. Dean & Co., Bel
lingham Bay Improvement Company,
Gardiner Mill Company, Pacific Pine
Company, E. S. Slade Lumber Com
pany, Clatsop Mill Company, Grays
Harbor Commercial Company and
! Simpson Lumber Company.
Shortly after the meeting opened the
representative of the Gardiner Mill
Company asked permission of his asso
ciates to withdraw. He announced
that it was Impossible for his firm to
hold its own patrons unless prices were
seriously alarming fact that the Secre
tary of the Treasury was fully in
formed of the mismanagement of the
bureau, and that he had resolved to
put an end to it, no matter whether a
major or a general was to be displaced
thereby. The fact alsn that the ap
pointment was made without consult
ing either Jackson or Meredith, or ask
ing them for a letter of recommenda
tion, was another disagreeable element
of the episode. This was followed short
ly after by the appointment by the Sec
retary of Chinese Inspectors Tippitt
and Barbour, sent from the East to- be
come members of the bureau at San
Francisco. In the selection of these
three men the Collector and Meredith
i had no voice whatever. They had to
i accept what they received in a spirit
of resignation or indignation, which
ever suited best their official moods,
! and no vote of thanks has yet appeared
j on record for the same.
But the hardest blow of nil was the
appointment of James R. Dunn as chief
! of the bureau without previous notice
|to the Collector. More than that, the
! fact of the appointment was known to
i the Washington correspondent of Th^
\ Call and was announced in the columns
of The ("all long before Collector Jack^
: son admitted that he had heard any
j thing at all about it. These acts on the
| part of the Treasury Department are
susceptible of only one interpretation,
reduced to meet the competition which
had entered the local field through out-
Bide firms. The application of the linn.
v.as placed upon the table and then
more trouble followed. The representa
tive of the E. K. Wood Lumber Com
pany also announced the wish of his
firm to withdraw. It was evident that
the Pine Manufacturers' Asssociation
was going to pieces and some remedy,
even if it were only temporary, must be
devised.
Under the authority of a resolution
the Gardiner Company was given per
mission for two weeks to sell to its
own people at competitive rates on con
dition that the company withdrew its
resignation. The Wood Company was
i allowed to sell for the same period, at
the best rates it can command. The
other members of the association will
strive to maintain prices and wait for
results. There is a growing foar, how
ever, that the association will not he
able to withstund the serious defections
from its own ranks.

and that is that the department has de
termined to manage the bureau from
Washington and in its own way, the
bureau to be independent of the Col
lector, and the bureau and the Collector
being a check upon the lapses and er
rors of each other. Furthermore, that
the department will not tolerate the
methods heretofore pursued in the bu
reau which permitted that office to be
made the rendezvous for Chinese brok
ers and their attorneys.
It is understood that Customs Sur
veyor Spear, who has charge of the im
migrants on the Mail dock, will be al
lowed to prevent gangs of highbinders
from visiting the immigrants and
scheming with them to secure their il-
lo^al landing in this State. It will be
remembered by The Call's readers that
about the middle of last September Sur
v< yor Spear issued an order to the cus
toms inspectors at the gate that no
pt rmi f to visit the Chinese on board
the ?teamer or on the dock should bo
recognized unless countersigned by
himself. This action was taken by the
Surveyor in crder to stop a grave abuse
of the visiting privilege, whereby the
efforts of honest officials to prevent the
Illegal importation or coolies \<\-,s
thwarted. For instance Mr. Spear came
into possession of passes issued by
Meredith for four persons to visit one
immigrant â two white men and two
Chinamen. When Collector Jackson's

STRANGE ACTION AGAINST
MISS MARY DEFFEBACH.
Friends of Miss Mary Matilda Deffebaeh
i think thoy see in a recent application for
â  guardianship over her an attempt to rail
road her to an asylum for the insane. The
application was made by Michael Flood,
who was joined by the brother and sis
t< is of the young woman.
Dr. J. F. Twist is the trustee of her
property, and according to her friends has
administered it carefully ami successfully.
: It consists of 110 acres of land in Mill Val

$75,000 in time.
The only allegation in the complaint
against Miss Deffebach is that she author

higher price. The property was sold to
satisfy a pressing mortgage. The com
plalnt against her will be heard by Judge-

Sir William Van Home and the party
accompanying him are being extensively
attention was called to the matter he
said that the permit was proper,, the
four persons being no doubt the white
lawyer, the Chinese client, the Chinese
interpreter and a white photographer.
On the very next day Mr. Jackson is
sued an order proclaiming: that no per
mits should be recognized, except such
as bore the signature of Meredith, thus
nullifying the order issued by Mr. Spear
and leaving the management of the de
tained Chinese in the hands of Mere
dith. When the Collector was asked
why he had practically revoked the or
der issued by Mr. Spear he replied that
he, tho Collector, was the person des
ignated by law to handle the Chinese,
and that Spear had no authority in the
premises. Yet it is the fact that Mr.
Spear always has had custody of the
Chinese at the Mail dock by virtue of
his official position and still exercises
the function of jailer.
It is understood that under the now
method of conducting the bureau, a
Chinese interpreter in the service of the
Government will be present at every in
terview with a Chinese immigrant seek
ing to land and that highbinders and
coolie brokers v' ' be no lunger al
lowed to ply their nefarious avocation
under the noses of the Federal officials.
Mr. Spear, who is responsible for the
safe keeping of the Chinese prisoners
at the Mail dock, will be allowed to take
such measures as he may deem neces
sary to insure their detention until le
gally landed.
Much good will be accomplished by
the new mode of enforcing the exclu
sion act. The head of the bureau will
no longer be the creature of the Collec
tor, and will be therefore more inde- I
pendent in the performance of his du
ties. He will be directly responsible to
the Secretary of the Treasury for wh it
ever mistakes he may make, and th^re
will be no collectors and ex-collectors
t.p intercede fur him and furnish cer
tificates of character to save him from
the departmental wrath. He must
stand upon his own feet, and his char
acter must speak, not through hear
say certificates, but through his official |
acts. The trouble with Meredith has
been that his certificates of character
don't dovetail with his official mistakes
which, unfortunately for him, if they
were mistakes, were on the wrong side.
They were invariably on the side- of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company and
the slave dealers and against the in
terests of the exclusion act and the
Government. No merchant will keep a
clerk who makes mistakes in giving
change against his employer or who
doles out good coins for counterfeit.
Again, if, after Mr. Jackson shall j
have retired from office to rest upon
such laurels as he may have won, a
bad man, working in the interest of the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company,
should receive the appointment as Col
lector of the Port, the head of the Chi
nese Bureau will be an eye of the Gov
ernment glaring upon him. If he al
lows a chinaman to enter without be
ing entitled to the privilege, the China
man will be arrested and the act of the
Collector will be reviewed by the bu
reau and the court. Thus there will
be an effectual check upon the Collec
tor; and on the other hand, if the Pa
cific Mail Steamship Company shall
foist into the bureau another Meredith,
the Collector may act as a check upon
the chief, and may take such measures
as may be calculated to expose and
punish fraud or criminal mistakes.
Consistently with their past record of
mendacity and low cunning, Meredith
and his backers have made use of mis
representation and prevarication in
their unsuccessful and shameless effort
to have him reinstated into his old po
sition as chief of the Chinese Bureau.
They have circulated a report that he
was dismissed, not because of any neg
lect of duty, but because he used in
sulting language to a reporter of The
Call and to Dr. Gardiner. They argued
both orally and on paper (from the of
fice of the Pacific Mail Steamship Com
pany) that his offense arose from great
provocation and that, after all, all that
he was guilty of was giving way to his
temper. He was not dismissed because
Fong Suey Wan escaped, they said, and
the assertion that her escape was the
cause of his dismissal they declared to
be an oral slander and a printed libel.
A letter written by Collector Jackson
and exhibited by Meredith's friends is
so worded as to befog the subject. The
circulation of such false statements is
not calculated to do the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company any good, for the
Secretary of the Treasury knows why
Meredith was let go. In order to set
the matter right, it is necessary to re
capitulate briefly the nature of the in
vestigation which resulted in the re
entertained during their visit to this city.

Wanted to Go to Manila.
James Holmes, a bright boy. 13 years |
of age, was found wandering around the ;
water front early yesterday morning by I
Policeman Bailey. He interrogated the 1
boy and ascertained that he came from i
Buffalo, N. V.. with Company H of the |
Thirteenth Infantry and was going with I
them to Manila, but the transport sailed j
without him. He was hungry, and after
Bailey had fed him he sent him to the J
cent upheaval in the bureau for the
good of the service.
An exposition was held last summer
in Omaha and among the concessions
was one of the Mcc Lee Village Asso
ciation, a Chinese company, which re
produced a Chinese village on the
grounds and gave theatrical and acro
batic entertainments. About five hun
dred men and women of more or lessâ
generally â virtue were imported
from China to take part in the village
show, and they were admitted under a
special privilege granted by the United
States, under the terms of which the
actors, acrobats, shopkeepers and at
tendants were to return to â  China at
the expiration of three months' after
the close of the exposition. It was
found that before the exposition closed
about 200 women, mostly of the boat
men's class, had left Omaha and had
gone to reside in different cities in the
Union, San Francisco getting the most
of them. This becoming known, the
Government ordered Major Moore to or
ganize a raid upon the Chinatown
bagnios in this city for the purpose of
arresting and deporting the # runaways.
Collector Jackson detailed a large force
of customs inspectors to assist in the
raid, but for some reason never made
public the police were informed of the
contemplated movement and were sta
tioned in the houses to be raided, where
they were found a half-hour later by
the Federal posse in full possession
and the whole of Chinatown advised of
what was going on. The Federal posse
were detained at the Custom-house
awaiting the order of Jackson to start.
Notwithstanding the publicity given to
the affair about twenty-seven women
without certificates were captured.
Among the number taken to the Pres
byterian Chinese Mission on Sacra
mento street was a middle-aged woman
named Fong Suey Wan, a notorious
procuress of considerable wealth and
the wife of the partner of Little Pete,
a noted Chinese boss and slave dealer,
lately deceased by the grace of a high
binder's bullet in a Chinatown barber
shop.
When the women were being ques
tioned at the mission Miss Cameron,
the matron, recognized the procuress
and informed Meredith of her identity.
Meredith ordered her to be detained
notwithstanding that her certificate in
due form was then being presented for
inspection. Nothing further was done
by Meredith to hojd the woman. He
filed no complaint against her, he did
not even inform the United States Mar
shal, the District Attorney or any one
else in authority that he proposed to
place any charge against her. On the
next day after her arrest Arthur Lotto,
a reporter, warned Meredith that the
woman would be discharged on pre
sentation of her certificate before Court
Commissioner Heacock if Meredith did
not file a complaint charging her with
being a procuress. Meredith replied
that it was "all right," he was getting
up "a great case" against her. On the
next morning the woman was taken
before Commissioner Heacock, on the
same floor as the Chinese Bureau and
about seventy-five feet distant, and her
certificate being produced, the court
stated that he would recommend her
discharge, there being no complaint ac
cusing her of any offense. She was then
taken to the office of the United States
Marshal, directly underneath the office
of the Chinese Bureau, and kept there
until 2 o'clock in the afternoon, when
she was brought before United States
District Judge de Haven and dis
charged. Then she disappeared.
Meredith could offer no reasonable
explanation as to why he had allowed
the woman to escape, and public
clamor was raised, the episode savor
ing too strongly of corruption to be
passed by in silence. Special Agent
Moore, in pursuance of instructions
from Washington, made an investiga
tion, examining witnesses and taking
affidavits of all parties concerned. He
sent his report to Washington, and
about the time that the department
was looking into the report ex-Collector
Wise appeared in Washington and told
the Treasury people and the newspaper
correspondents a fairy story to the
effect that the woman was allowed to
ge because Major Moore and Miss
Cameron had asked that Fong Suey be
allowed to return to China.
As a matter of justice to Mr. Wise it
must be said that he knew nothing of
the case of his own knowledge, as all
his information had been derived from
Meredith and his friends. Then charges
were filed against Special Agent Moore
for making an assault upon a woman
employed in his office as typewriter,
and the Secretary of the Treasury, in
view of Moore's disgrace, sent Moore's
report back to this city to be verified
by Special Agents Linck and Smith.
The witnesses were re-examined and
the Fong Suey Wan report was sent
on to Washington once more. It was
upon this report, which dealt with the
Fong Suey Wan incident alone, that
Meredith was dismissed.
Subsequently the special agents sent
a supplemental report to Washington
in connection with the matter of Mere
dith having used abusive language to
Dr. Gardiner and a reporter of The
Call, but before it had reached the Sec
retary of the Treasury Meredith had
been dismissed from the service.
That is why Meredith's application
for reinstatement was found to have
no force, for he utterly failed to show
that he was innocent of the charge of
having allowed the noted procuress to
walk out of his hands.

The tornado struck the city last evening
when most of the residents were at sup
ppr, cutting a clean path one mile long j
and COO feet wide through the residence
section and leaving death and destruction
in its wake. Buildings were demolished
or twisted apart and scattered to the four
wind: A conservative estimate places
the aggregate amount of damage at $200,
--fv>o the individual losses ranging from
Jl'iu to $8000.
The wind played many pranks and there
were some miraculous escapes. J. T.
Coonfield and his family were eating sup
per when the tornado struck their home.
The house was picked up and carried
across a slough and dumped up against
a hill. The building was not completely
wrecked, and the family escaped without
anything worse than a severe shaking up.
Houses on both sides of the residence of
W. M. Hull were blown into splinters,
but the wind was content with twisting
his house off its foundation and leaving
it Intact. The house was in the center of
the district, and it was used as a hospital
after the inn.
P. J. Rleger, a prominent attorney, ran
right into the path of the storm to save
his family, who were helpless with fear.
Dashing into the house, he carried his
â wife and children into the cellar. As he
stumbled into the place of safety the
building was leveled to the ground. He
was just in tin to save his loved ones
and is happy, although his loss by the
cyclone amounts to J3OOO.
Among the first of the buildings wrecked
was the $10,000 residence of Mrs. Hensley,
iii the southeastern part of the city. Not

and often added to this the digestive func-
tions are out of order;. these two conditions
cause nearly all the headaches from which
women suffer.
There are two great remedies specially
adapted to these ailments inventea by the
chief consulting physician of the famous
Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute of
Buffalo, N. V., Dr. R. V. Pierce. His
world-renowned "Favorite . Prescription "
is the most successful ' medicine ever
known for the cure of distinctly feminine
ailments and his "Golden Medical Discov-
ery" is the one supremely effective cure
for digestive difficulties.
Taken in conjunction they completely
rejuvenate the nervous system of weak
and debilitated women; giving health,
strength and capacity to the nerve-centers;
renewed power to the blood-making glands
and energetic force to the entire body.
A lady living in Coshocton Co., Ohio, Mrs. W.
T. Stanton. of Btissfield, writes: " I had female
weakness very bad for nearly three years. Had
dragging down pains In and above my hips and
such dreadful pains in the back and top of my
head (just as though someone was lifting me by
the hair). Had no ambition, would try to work
a few days then would have to lie in bed for a
long time. No tongue can express the suffering
I endured. I had much pain at monthly pe-
riods. 1 doctored most of the time with as good
a physician as there is in the state, but had no
ease only when I was quiet and off my feet and
then I had more or leas pain in my head. When
I began taking Dr. Pierce* medicines I weighed
102 pounds, and was very pale and weak. I look
twelve bottles of the 'Favorite Prescription !
and seven of the ' Golden Medical Discovery.'
Now I feel like a different person. Have no
pain in my head,, can do all !my work for self,
husband and one child; am gaining in flesh, i
feel it is through God's mercy and your wonder-
ful medicines that I am cured."
Where constipated conditions exist Dr.
Pierces mild and agreeable " Pleasant Pel-

a vestige of it is left. The Catholic i
Church, a fine brick structure in the east
ern part, was unroofed and otherwise
damaged. The dwelling of Judge Andrew |
Ellison, in the same locality, was stripped â 
of Its second story. He and his family
and John Dogheny took refuge in the
cellar and were saved. The residence of
H. Lowell, just outside of town, was <
twisted Into a heap of ruins and three of
his children killed and burned In the j
.!â¢ bris. Other large residences were lifted :
from their foundations and literally torn
Into kindling wood.
For a time the people in that portion of
the town not touched by the storm were
stricken, but as soon as they recov- 1
â red their wits they immediately went to
the aid of their unfortunate townsmen.
'alls were sent to surrounding towns and
were quickly responded to. The wounded
were carried to the homes of hospitable
people in the neighborhood. Twenty-five
doctors from Moberly, Macon and other '
points along the line of the Wabash rail- :
road came to Kirksville last night in re
sponse to urgent calls for medical assist
ance. The visiting doctors co-operated
with the local physicians and the work of
caring for the wounded was expedited.
Hundreds of persons visited tue stricken '
district ot-day and a large number of 1
=ightseers came from neighboring towns.
The special officers would not allow any '
one without authority to go through the
ruined district. Kirksville streets have
l>een hub deep in mud ever since the first '
-pring shower, and the rain that followed
the tornado has made them impassable
for wagon?. This state of affairs hinders
ihr> work of gathering the dead and makes
the compilation of the great list of victims
Impossible for the time being. All busi
ness has been enued, and the only j
stores open for business are those dealing |
in drugs.
The scenes of the rescuers were horri- |
fying. An aged man and his wife :
had evidently been eating L.eir evening
meal when the cyclone struck and carried
their home away. They had clasped each
other in their arms and were found dead j
i>n the ground some distance away from '
where their home had been. No trace of
their house has been seen. Several of the i
dead were found in spots which would I
have been the center of the house had the
building not been blown to splinters. This
was the case with Mrs. Panscnott, who â 
suffered a most terrible death. Her head
l< ss body, with its arms clasping her life- |
less baby, was discovered on the floor of
tho house, which was left as a razed plat- ,
form in an open field. The head was as !
nicely severed as if it had been done with
a knife and was about twenty feet dis
tant. Two children had been lying in a
cot in one of the destroyed homes.
The house was carried away, but the
floor of the first story and the founda
tion were left, the wind lifting the house
from the sills and tumbling it a long dis
tance. The cot on which the little ones
lay was lifted up with them on it and
carried fully a block and a half and set
down on the ground. Neither of the chil
dren was hurt. Along the railroad track
between tho depot and lloggs Crossing,
a distance of a half mile, was a mas of
debris. The wrecks of many homes were
scattered along there and tho trees v.- re
tilled with hodclothing and other house
hold goods.
Mayor Noonan, assisted by a number of
citizen opened an Intelligence bureau at
noon. Messengers were sent through the
stricken district in search of persons who
were known to have resided in that sec
tion of the town. Every citizen ma it
his duty to report at the bureau of in
formation all cases of death, injury and
of persons missing. In this way some
little degree of order was brought out of
chaos. - â¢
At 2 o'clock it was said at headquar- j
ters that the Injured so far numbered
seventy-four, with about a dozen cases !
which arc sure to result fatally. This list \
is not complete, however.
There are two undertakers in Kirks
ville. and together they had all they
could do taking care of the dead. A
meeting of citizens, at which the Mayor
presided, was held this afternoon at "the
opera-house. Committees were appointed
to systematize the work of clearing away
the debris, and finding shelter for the
homeless ones and raising funds for their
temporary care. The i are at least 1000
homeless people in Kirksville to-night.
The freaks of the storm were many,
but one of the strangest occurrences was
the finding of a crooning baby out in a
field far from any house. The child was
scarcely scratched. No one has called for
the baby and it has not been identified. i
Another baby was found where it had
been bruised to death by the violent wind.
This baby also has not been identified.
Among the horrors of the storm was
the finding of the corpse of a 16-year-old !
girl, with a two-by-four scantling driven
through her body. The body of a little
child was found, with the limb of a tree
sticking through its neck. A citizen was
found after the storm standing over the
body of his dead wife. The head had i
been crushed and severed from the body.

MYSTERY OF STARR'S
FATE IS NOT SOLVED
LOS ANGELES, April 28.â Four
days have elapsed since Hillary
S. Starr, the young superinten
dent of the Oak Knoll ranch,
near Pasadena, suddenly disap
peared, under circumstances strongly
pointing to murder. Up to a late hour
to-night no solution of the tragical
mystery has been found, although offi
cers have continued the search and
have investigated every clev.\
Wilson Lako, the historic body of
\ water at the base of the old Mission
Mill, has been thoroughly dragged for
1 the body of the missing man, but noth
| ing was found that would lead to the
' conclusion that his captors or abduct
i ors had attempted to conceal the crime
: by throwing Starr's body Into the lake.
1 While the public belief In Pasadena
still leans to the theory of murder and
i robbery, there are those, including
; some officers, who incline to the opinion
\ that Starr may have taken this sen
| sational method to voluntarily disap
pear from his home.
As Stan- is admitted to have
possessed a gloomy disposition, he may
| have wandered away while temporarily
insane, but his friends contend that his
â  family relations were of the best, and
j that Starr would hardly smash his own
lantern and have a buggy concealed In
j the. woods and use it to spirit himself
away.
Where Superintendent Starr Was Last Seen.
The presence of blood near the lan
tern in the pump house has been ex
plained by the fact that one of the
bloodhounds used to track tho foot
prints cut his foot on the glass of the
broken lantern. Mrs. Starr, who lives
on the ranch, and who is being cared

ANCIENT BED OF
KLONDIKE RIVER
Bench Claims Yield Big
Returns.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April John Galbralth of
' Sturgis, S. D., who returned to-day from
i Dawson, was one of the most fortunate
i prospectors who went to the Klondike
I last year. He brought out $60,000 In
drafts, over $1600 In cash and several
pounds of nuggets, which represent the
net proceeds of his single bench claim
! during the past year.
Galbraith started north a year ago, ac
| companied by J. C. Brown of Montana.
i They reached Dawson In May. After rest
! Ing for a few days they started to pros
pect. Ten miles out they spent the night
at a cabin. The next morning they com
menced panning gravel on the hillside
above them. Coarse colors were found
In each pan, and they decided to ' sink
holes at a place where 20 cents to the pan
was realized. Each took up a claim, Gal
bralth getting a Discovery claim of 250 by
1000 feet. a stampede followed their re
cording and the hillsides were staked for
miles. Galbraith ran a tunnel, which is
In ISO feet.
As they progressed inward the frozen
gravel became richer, indicating they
had struck the ancient bed of Klondike
River. Galbralth's tunnel has produced
over $100,000 in gold. He employs twelve
men. This, together â  with the royalty,
1 cost of wood and other expenses, reduced
, his net proceeds to $63,000. The unwashed
gravel now taken out will yield $25,000 at
the June clean-up. Galbraith estimates
the gold-bearing value of his claim at
$1,500,000.
Brown has remained to look after their
1 interests. His claim is producing almost
I equally well. Galbraith's claim has made
! the best record as a producer of any
I bench claim.
The shooting of a Katha Indian named
John by his hunting companion, Alexan-
I der, last month caused excitement among
the Dawson Indians. Alexander was trail
ing moose when he noticed a movement
In the bushes and fired, thinking an ani
mal was coming toward him. The bullet
pierced both of John's lungs and he died
immediately. Rev. Mr. Totty, a mission
ary, saved Alexander from arrest.
Two Circle City miners recently fought
a duel over a pretty dressmaker. The
principals were named Thompson and
Sullivan. One man had a revolver and '
the other a knife. Sullivan loved Annie
Blank and was visiting at her cabin.
Thompson came along and demanded ad
mittance. When refused he started to
break down the door. Doors being expen- !
sive at Circle City Sullivan decided it was I
I cheaper to open the door and stab Thomp-
I son. He undid the fastenings and plunged
: his long dirk knife into Thompson's lung.
The latter drew his revolver and shot
Sullivan through the body. Both were
expected to die.

PORTLAND, Or., April 28.â RoV. David
Clayborne Garrett, reotor of Trinity Epls- j
copal Church of this city, has accepted
the rail from St. Luke's BptÃcopal I

but he decided he could not leave the
work which he had entered upon here.
After further deliberation and the adjust- j
ment of church affairs here he decided to j
accept the call from San Francisco.
Mr. Garrett was born in Burlington,
In w.i. on December 23. 1857. He was edu

SALE OF SUGAR STOCK.
HONOLULU, April What was a
well denned rumor on the arrival of
Messrs. Macfarlane. Hecht and Strassber
ger from San Francisco the first of the
week regarding the control of the Ha
waiian Sugar Company's stock to-night
assumes the appearance of actuality. j
Owing to differences among brokers in
San Francisco the option for placing the
majority of the stock in London or New
York, perhaps partly In each of those
cities, probably will be exercised next
week. H. P. Baldwin will be here then
to close the details. A strong syndicate
is organized, including Colonel Macfarlane
and Alexander & Baldwin, representing
local interests, to carry out the deal.
Makaweli. the plantation Involved, was
originally floated in London by Colonel
Macfarlane at a capitalization of $2,000,

the five years since its first crop was man- !

TWO LEFT FOR
SPEAKERSHIP
Contest Has Narrowed
Down.
lal Dtsp&ich to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 28.
The Speakership has been narrowed
down to Henderson of lowa mid Sher
man of New York. There is a rumor
that Senator Hanna may throw the
weight of his advice and inlluenc â  to
a man who hails from somewhere west
of the Wabash. These appear to be the
salient features of the Speakership gos
sip of the day.
Some Representatives now in Wash
ington declare their belief thai â¢i.'ither
Mr. Hopkins nor Mr. Cannon will with
draw in favor of the other, nor submit
to the dictation <>f n caucus of the del* -
gation. If that attitude Is persistently
maintained it will remove Illinois as a
factor in the casÂ». although efforts will
be made, it is said, to keep Lhe dtlega
tion intact and cast its vote as a whole
for some other candidate.
Word is pomp around thai Senator
Hanna, who may be expected to be con
siited by his Republican frtVnd-a in the
House upon the contest Groin tin c to
time, is averse to tha â  of an
Eastern man. It is Raid that he favors
a man from the fir West, although no
choice has been mentioned by name.
If this proves to be the case an in
teresting- battle may be ted be
tween Senator Hanna and Si nator
Platt in influencing the contest, for of
course these two great leaders will
have something to say in the outcome,
notwithstanding the general supposi
tion that th>- Hous.- settles its own
elections. Mr. Platt is generally sup
posed to be backing Mr. Sherman for
the Speakership.
It is not believed that Ohio will have
a candidate. General Grosvenor and
Mr. Burton are willing, but they ar
beincr held in leash, it is thought, to
be set loose if it is found that the can
didacy of an Ohio man is necessary to
break a deadlock.
KYTKA QUALIFIES AS
AN EXPERT ON INK
WILLOW'S, April 28.â The Murdoch:
note case has been at a standstill as re
gards evidence for the past two days, as
the attorneys have been arguing on the
admissibility of testimony. Th< defense
put a witness on the .-nv.nl Wednesday to
prove that William Murdock had plenty
of money when the $100,000 note was given.
This question has been argued for the
past two days and submitted to the
court yesterday at B o'clock. This morn
ing Judge I'irkey sustained the objection
which shuts out all such < vidence.
The defense then called Ames, the hand
writing â¢ â¢xpvrt. The affidavit of Samuel
Murdock, which was signed before Jus
tire of the Peace Klrkpatrick In 1878 was
shown to Ames and i, ( attempted to
prove that the affidavit was made years
later than 1878. Under cross-examination
Ames said he could not tell the age of
the document by its appearance. It was
not written within the past month, but
might have been written within a year.
Expert Kytka was recalled and quali
fied as an expert on ink. He was aski d
how different inks looked when photo
graphed. He had photographed the affi
davit under discussion aiid explained that
ink which had yellowed by age t"<ik On a
much darker hue. Up said the photograph

which was undiluted would appear thirty
years fmm now a perfectly solid and
even line, while in the diluted ink in the
instrument there appeared ragged lines
caused by the coloring matter n< wing
out to the edges and lodging there. There
was not a single instance in the M"i docu

PRINCETON CHAIR
FOR CLEVELAND
NEW YORK, April 28.â The Princeton alumni and friends nf the
university who are conversant with its affairs have not waited for the
trustees to meet and act upon the recent anc/nymous gift of $100,000 to
endow a professorship of general politica in the institution, but have
settled upon former President Grover Cleveland as the occupant of the
chair. It is even said that the donor of the fund had Mr. Cleveland in
mind, and that the place has been created in order that he may be
formally attached to the university in which he has shown such a lively
interest since he last left the White House.
As the university already has a professorship of jurisprudence and
politics, which is filled by Professor Woodrow Wilson, there was some
speculation as to the purpose in creating a new chair for general poli
tics until Mr. Cleveland's name was mentioned in connection with the
place. It was explained that the new professorship would embrace in
ternational law, political science, diplomacy and the fundamental prin
ciples of government. The field to be covered will be supplementary
to that covered by Professor Wilson.

PYTHIA ANOTHER GOOD THING
GOVERNOR SHEEHAN SCORED
AGAIN ON TWO LEGS.
Three Beaten Choices at Oakland.
Slow Track and Fair Attendance.
Pat Morrissey Galloped In.
Heigh-Ho Also Won.
The muchly touted two-year-old Louis
18. McWhirter stepped up to the plate
again at Oakland yesterday and knocked
out a three-bagger. The imp. Brutus
youngster had been a disappointment in
former races. With the distance stretched
out to five furlongs it was quite another
thing, inn sat astride his back, and the
ring started in by laying 50 to 1 against
him. It was rubbed later to 25. Away
seventh, Hahn had reached third
position In the stretch, and gradually
moved up, beating out Pythia another
good thing, played from 10 clown to t>. a
length in 1:03 flat. Wlnyah, the favorite,
ran unplaced
The track was slow, which accounted
for the poor time made. Three favorites
were successful.
Aluminum, a 7 to 5 favorite in the bet- j
ting, took the opening six furlong selling j
run without great effort from Defender.
Jerilderio, the second â :!â¢â !.'. . lacked
speed when it was most needed.
It Is taid that Don Gara is a "dope
horse." If this is true, then he was sent
to the post uncharged in the sprint that '
followed. Receding from 6 to 5 to â¢i to 1,
Piggott was unable to make him run a j
yard. Governor Sheehan, played from 6 i
to 4, lasted long enough to down Paul i
Kruger, a :Â» to 1 shot, half a length.
The third number, also ,i sprint over
the Futurity course, was only a canter
for the favorite. Socialist, ridden by Jen
kins. Bessie Lee led Flora Hawk over
the mark for second place.
Many played Daisy F to defeat the fa
vorite. Pat Morrlssey, in the seven furlong
soiling affair, but the mare failed to make '
the priding gallop. Seven to 10 was once
obtainable about the gelding, which madÂ© !
all the running, and won easing up.
The concluding six furlong dash was
about the most open betting race of the
day, resulting in Prompto and Tony ;
I.icalzi closing equal choices in the bet
ing. When the barrier was released Jack
Ward, on Heigh Ho. sailed away in the
lead and at the .wire led Prompto out a

SINGLES TOURNAMENT
AT CALIFORNIA CLUB
Three days of tournament tennis will
crowd the courts of the California Tennis
Club this afternoon, Sunday and Monday.
The club has arranged a singles class
tournament and, judging from the en
tries, some very close matches will be
seen before the finals are reached.
In the preliminary matches the best two
out of three will decide; and in the finals
the best three out of five sets. The en
trance fee has been fixed at 50 cents. En
tries will not close until the time for
drawing. Up to date the following have
signed their names to the entry list: R.
J. Davis. Werner Stauf. Harry Weihe,
Duval Moore, R. W. Bliven, Dr. C. B.
Root. H. W. Walter, J. A. Code and Rob
ert N. Whitney. Suitable prizes will be
given the winner and runner-up.
John D. Spreckels Jr. has returned to
the courts. On Thursday morning he
played three hours, from 7 to 10, with
Professor Joe Daily. The latter proved
too much for SprecKels. defeating him in
three straight sets. Walter Hobart will
renew his playing. His first trial will be
made this afternoon.
Cyclers" Outing.
The Ynpemite . Wheelmen's f'luh will
hold a mnonlipht run to San Jose this
evening. Cyclers will moet ;tt Fruitvale,
taking the last boat from this city.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 29, 1899.
ST. BERNARDS WILL BE
A DOG-SHOW FEATURE
Cfoarleg Celebrated fiolden Lion.
OX Wednesday next, when the annual show of the San Francisco Kennel
Club opens at Mechanics' Pavilion, there will be benched a collection of
dogs as high in quality as were ever exhibited in^ the United States. In
number of entries It gives way to New York alone, exceeding all the other
largo cities on the Eastern dog show circuit. Five hundred and sixty-nine dogs,
representing almost every known breed, will be shown.
The St. Bernards will he better represented than heretofore. The total entry
is ninety-eight, as against forty-six last year and fifty-nine In IW. This increase
is ascribed to the energy of the members of the St. Bernard Club of California,
who are untiring In their efforts to foster the interest of fanciers in the "Holy
Breed.'' Golden Lion, from the kennel of Charles Newman, is a prominent candi
date for honors in this class.
That the specialty clubs are efficient in the execution of their purposes may
l>e Been in the mastiff entry this year, which reaches the record number of thirty
three. New York only benched sixteen of this breed, Chicago and Boston even
loss: so this large entry may be justlj regarded as th<- result of the work of
the Pacific Mastiff Club, whose members show no less than fourteen of the dogs.
In "1W only thirteen mastiffs were benched and In 1897 twenty-five. A pretty
spectacle will be a bunch of puppies sired by Chino Don, out of Lola, of which
Mrs. J. P. Norman was the owner. Mrs. Norman show-s two of the pupsâ Lola
and Hebe Montea. Messrs. I'ick. Murray and Lincoln show three dogsâ Bu<_-no,
Newman and Don Montez.
The Fox-Terrier Club is another instance in point. Tn ISO 7 the club was in a
flourishing condition and fox-terrier entries numbered forty-four. In 1898 the
club languished, and entries sank to twenty-six. This year, owing to J. B. Mar
tin's energy ami power of organization and Mr. Hickman's liberal pecuniary and
moral support, the club has been effectively resuscitated and the entries have
risen to fifty-one, <>n which splendid result Messrs. Hickman and Martin, presi
dent and secretary of the club, have every reason to congratulate themselves.
The California Collie Club has practically effaced Itself from recognized dog
dom by joining an unimportant local organization in opposition to the American
Kennel Club. This is to be regretted, as some of the members of the club are
am"iig the most enthusiastic dog fanciers of the CO&St.
Hull-terriers are another breed that show a decided increase over previous
years, Inasmuch as forty dogs are shown, against thirty-four In l^ l^ and twen
ty-three in 1887, indicating a steady and substantial gain in popularity.

The fishing is to the north of the sta
tion and distant about (00 yards. The best
time for bass fishing is during the In
coming tide, but frequently they feed at
low water. The lure* which have proved
jful are clams and live or fresh
shrimps. As to the kind of tackle best
adapted for the sport. Henry Skinner, the
well-known By caster, will sive anglers
full particulars.
During the early part of the week sev
eral gplendid bass were tak.'ii by Al Wil

of Alameda. Young Cracknel! hpoked and
landed a 21t6-pound basa on a B-ounce
bamboo rod last Monday. Tin- tish gave
the lad a tight which lasted thirty min
utes. Last rhursday Professors Marcus
and .Terry tried their luck for bass, but
owing: t.r a strong and cold wind that
blew from the west during the afternoon
and discolored the water th<Mr !u<-k was

Ing two Immense stingarees, one which
weighed 56% pounds. Although he failed
to hit the stripes, he enjoyed the sport ..f

RELEASED ON
STRAW BONDS
AND ABSCONDED
Harry Wilson Again
at Liberty.
CLERK KELLY IN EVIDENCE
COrSTERNATIOk AT POLICE
HEADQUARTERS.
Descriptions of the Suspected Stran
gler Are Sent Broadcast Through
out the ~!tate for Purposes
of Identification.
The facility with which notorious crimi
nals are enabled to escape punishment for
their crimes was agui.i exemplified yes
terday in the case of Harry Wilson, the
negro who is suspected of being the man
who strangled two disreputable women
three years ago and robbed a number of
other women.
The detectives had been searching for
evidence against Wilson on the more seri
ous charges, but on Thursday it was de
cided to book him on three charges of
petty larceny so that hÂ»* could be kept
in prison pending the investigations on
the other suspected crimes. It was not
supposed that he could feet bonds for his
release and when it was known yesterday
morning that he had been released at 9:20
o'clock Thursday nlghi on $900 bonds ac
cepted by Clerk Kelly of Judge Graham's
court the worst was t\:ared and there was
consternation at police headquarters.
This was intensified whf-n it became
known that the cases had been called In
Judge Graham's court and Wilson had
failed to answer to his n;'.me.
Chief I>ei:s and Captain Seymour at once
saw Judge Graham and a bench warrant
was Issued for Wilson's arrest and his
bonds were increased to $2wu on each of
the three charges. The Chief wired all
over the State a description of Wilson
and asking for his arrest, while Detectives
Ed Gibson, Wren and McMahon were de
tailed with other men to search the city
for him in the hope that he was still
here. His description as wired is: Harry
Wilson, colored; thief; aged 39; born in
Kentucky; height 5 feet 6^ inches; build
good; weight 153 pounds, hair negro; com
plexion copper. Remarks: Brown coat
and vest: light trousers; soft gray shirt;
soft black hat."
Bond Inspector Newman was sent for
by the Chief ami he went to Clerk Kelly
j and saw the bonds. He at once declared
| that they were not worth the paper on
â  which they wore written, and subsequent
investigation proved that he was correct.
The bondsmen were E. Riley, an ex-dep
uty sheriff, and Thomas EL Cosgrove, 312
Howard street. Riley qualified on a one
! fifth Interest in a 50-vara lot of land
bounded by Devlsadero, Pulton, Grove
and Scott streets, valued at $8000 and un-
Incumbered. Cosgrove qualified on "two
lots in the Railmad Homestead Associa
tion, four carts, sixteen horses, three
buggies and eight wagons, valued at 11500
and unincumbered." Neither of the two
men is nn th assessment roll.
Clerk Kdly explained that Attorney J.
X. K. Wilson and the two sureties called
at his house Thursday night and Wilson
assured him that the sureties were all
right. He accordingly accepted the bonds
and Issued orders for the negro's release.
He claims that. he was compelled to ac
â¢ .pi the bonds by virtue of his office.
Bond Inspector Newman declares that
Attorney Wilson knew that Riley was not
acceptable as a bondsman, as hf- had
warned him on a former occasion of that
fact.
thief Lees, when he learned of all th*
Circumstances, was furious and emphati
cally declared that he had been bunkoed
and that the release of Wilson on straw
bonds was a gross outrage. Hr said ho
was powerless In the matter, as the clerks
of the courts were appointed by the Board
of Supervisors. He Instanced the fact
that it was through th.> acceptance of a
straw bond by Clerk Kelly that "Austra
lian Eddie,' 1 the notorious pickpocket was
enabled u> defeat the ends of justice, and
â¢ ' : ' It Was limr some action was
tak'ii to put a stop to that sort of thine
It is probable that the matter will be
taken before the liraml Jury to see If In
dictments cannot be obtained against
Riley and Cosgrove for perjury in ralsolv
swearing that they owned property which
they do not own. There have been so
many oasr-s recently of straw bonds that
some drastic measures must be taken to
give these men a lesson.
The Police .In. lees had a consultation
on the subject, but came to the conclu
sion they had no jurisdiction over their
clerks after the adjournment of the
courts, and could do nothing. Captain
Seymour prepared a list of prisoners re
! on bonds by the clerks of the
courts between the hours of n p m and
6 a. m.. since the beginning of this month
and the number reached thirty-five \\*
pointed out that according to* order No
2p passed by the Board of Supervisors
April ;>. 1893. clerks of the Police Courts
can only accept bonds in their respective
court rooms or office attached thereto be
tween the hours of 9 a. m. and 4pm
and that they shall alternate weekly in
the evenings from 7:80 to m o'clock, ex
cept Sundays and holidays when the
hours are 10 a. m. till 2 p. m. It is speci
fically stated that they shall not accept I
sureties on bonds except within the
places and the times prescribed. ,\s a
result orders have been posted in all po
lice Btations to accept no orders of re

STILL REACHING FOR
LAFAYETTE SQUARE
REVIVAL OF AN OLD SUIT FOR
A CITY PARK.
It Includes Nearly All the Western
Half of the Property Now
Under Cultivation.
Another attempt i? rn;r.sÂ» mnfip to s=e
( ure possession of what remains of l,a
fayette Square. Suit h.is been riled In the
circuit Gouii by the Holladays, represent
ing the Delaney claimants, and they ask
for all of the northwest block and more
than half of the southwest block.
The suit is a revival of the litigation
by which the city lost what is known as
the Holladay property, and it is based
. n substantially the tame contentious. It
la brought In the Circuit Court because
it is alleged that In the manner in which
the case is set forth there Is a Federal
question involved.
The plaintiffs are Laura s. Delaney,
Mary A. M>Â«'urrie. Tcter P. WynantS,
Samuel \v. Holladay, Nathaniel Jacobs,
Edmund B. Holladay, James I). Whitney,
Frederick P. Castelhun and Frank R.
Whitcomb. They are all the heirs or as
signs of the original Matthew and Mary
Delaney, who settled on the property !â â 
tore the land was absorbed by the city
under legislative enactment.
The Supreme Court ol the State has
already decided that the Holladay prop
erty pissed from the control of the city
principally because a decision to that ef
fect was allowed to remain without ap
peal until the statutory time within
which appeals must be perfected had
elapsed, it was Intimated that had the
appeal been made in tune the decision of
the lower court would nave been reversed.
In this way the property was secured to
the Holladays, but with the other prop
erty there was no such mistake malt- and
the claimants were finally evicted about
four years ago. Among those who were

It Is claimed that, the Delaney 3, Mat

THE NEWS FROM MflNlLfl.
ANOTHER illustration of the superiority of the
special news service of The Call and the New
York Herald was given yesterday in the dis
patches from Manila announcing that Luna, chief of
staff of Aguinaldo, had sent an officer to our lines
to ask a cessation of hostilities.
That important item of news was sent to this coun
try exclusively by The Call-Herald service. In New
York it was published by the Herald only. The dif
ference in point of time between that city and San
Francisco enabled the Examiner to obtain it from
New York alter the Herald was on the street, and it
was therefore published in this city by that paper, but
without proper credit.
The importance of the news in this case renders it
a notable illustration of the effe^tiveneos of The Call-
Herald service, but it was by no means a rare per
formance. In fact hardly a week has passed since
the war with Spain began without furnishing some
proof of the superiority of our news gathering agency.
The Call and Herald, it will be remembered, were first
to get a report of the battle of Manila from an eye
witness, and we are now the first to give news of the
suit for peace on the part of the insurgents. To main
tain so effective a service of course require? a consid
erable expenditure of energy and money, but in the
end it pays better than Creelman fakes or stealing
news.
MR MUNTINGTON'S SPEECH-
A'OD speech in its way was that of Collis P.
Huntington at the Southern Pacific banquet,
but the way was wrong. Instead of moving for
ward to a discussion of the best means of promoting
the welfare of people now living in California, it
tended mainly to a consideration of the problem of
getting more people to live here. It is clearly not an
increase in the prosperity of California, but an in
crease in the number of persons who are subject to
the traffic taxes of the Southern Pacific, that interests
the gentleman.
"What California needs to-day," he said, "is more
le. What you merchants need is more customers
tc buy your goods." Then he uttered an epigrammatic
statement having all the dignity of an axiom: "The
only way you can get them is by having them here."
To accomplish the filling of the long felt want Mr.
Huntington suggested the importation of Finns.
"One little colony of hard-working, economical, vir
tuous people like the Finns," he said, "would leaven
the whole lump, for their example would be an in
citement to thousands, who, seeing their good work
and their good fortune, would strive to share it."
â¢le will dispute the desirability of increasing our
population, nor will there be any objection to an im
portation of Finns, provided they come to the State
with enough of money and skill to render them self
supporting from the start without crowding the labor
market and depressing the rate of wages. That, how
ever, is a comparatively minor issue afpresent. Cali
fornians are more interested just now in questions
of transportation charges than of immigration from
Finland. Had Mr. Huntinijton made his speech on
freight rates it would have been no doubt just as much
applauded at the banquet board and far more accept
able to the public.
Were the industries and the commerce of California
relieved from the burdens of excessive freight charges
there would be no need of applying to any foreign
land for immigrants. The natural riches of the State
are such that if it were not for the artificial.handicap
put upon progress by the railroad monopoly the pros
perity which would attend all its industries would
soon attract to our cities and to our fields a large
number of enterprising young Americans from all
parts of the East.
Despite all the Interstate Commerce Commission
has done, despite all the efforts of our merchants and
manufacturers, there exist ample reasons for believing
our trade is grossly discriminated against by the great
transcontinental lines. Mr. Huntington holds a po
tent position in railroad circles. He has proven him
self in many a conflict to be able, adroit and bold.
Californians are therefore justified in thinking that
if on this issue he fought as hard for the interests of
the State as. he has been known to fight against them
nt times we would now have a much more favorable
freight rate, not only on his line, but on all trans
continental lines. It is for that reason his speech at
the banquet will be regarded as something of a mis
take. He spoke on the wrong subject.
THE APPOINTMENT OF SENATORS.
THE country has been startled by a news de
spatch, which has gone for three days uncontra
dicted, that a treaty has been made whereby
Quay, is to be seated in the Senate on appointment by
the Governor, and that in return for the executive in
fluence which has committed a majority of Senators
to thft plan the State of Pennsylvania will support
President for renomination.
As a feature in the flux and change with which our
institutions are threatened, the subject of appointment
of Senators by Governors should be thoroughly dis
cussed and understood.
The abhorrent word "Treason" is creeping into
common use to characterize men who discuss the al
leged principles of our Government, but we assume
that an examination of the constitutional provisions
in reference to the Senate may yet be carried on with
out incurring the charge of being a traitor.
The constitution, article I, section 3, provides:
"The Senate of the United States shall be composed
of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Leg
islature thereof, for six # years, and each Senator shall
have one vote. Immediately after they shall be as
sembled in consequence of the first election they shall
be divided as equally as may be into three classes.
The seats of Senators of the first class shall be va
cated at the expiration of the second year, of the sec
ond class at the expiration of the fourth year, and of
the third class at the expiration of the sixth year, so
that one-third may be chosen every second year; and
if vacancies happen, by resignation or otherwise, dur
ing the recess of the Legislature of any State, the
executive thereof may make- temporary appointments
until the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall
then fill such vacancies."
Article V provides that "No State, without its con
sent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the
Senate."
It would seem that there can be no two opinions
as to the origin and limitation of a Governor's juris
diction over the appointment of a Senator. The plain
language of the constitution seems to settle that:
"I* vacancies happen, by resignation or otherwise,
during the recess of the Legislature of any State, the
executive thereof may make temporary appointments
until the next meeting of the Legislature, which shall
then fill such vacancies."
Ever since 1793 from time to time the exercise of this
executive jurisdiction has been discussed in the Sen
ate. In many cases that have arisen the discussion has
been upon the cause of the vacancy and a legal con
struction of the term "happen." It has been argued
that executive jurisdiction appears and a Governor
may appoint only if a Senator during his term re
signs, dies, is expelled or by incapacity through in
sanity becomes incompetent and cannot even resign.
that being an act requiring sanity. In this view of it
the set and fixed term of the Senatorial office is not
v happening. Its beginning and end are fixed by
law. Senator \\'hite"s term, for instance, did not
"happen" to end on March 3 last, nor did the result- J
ing vacancy "happen." Its occurrence was fixed by
law. What "happens" is defined by all English
lexicographers to be that which comes unexpectedly.
But passing by the discussion of the right of a Gov
ernor to appoint when a vacancy has not happened,
but has come about by the expiration of the term
fixed by law, the Senate has never heretofore varied
from the rule that the Governor's jurisdiction arises
only when the vacancy occurs in the recess of the
Legislature. The constitution therein is so plain that
a layman, without knowledge of the rules of legal
construction, cannot err in its interpretation. When
the terms ot Senators White, Quay, Gray and Cannon
expired by law on the 3d of March, 1809, the Legis
latures of California. Pennsylvania, Delaware and
Utah were in session and not in recess.
The first case involving the jurisdiction of a Gov
ernor to appoint a Senator arose in Delaware. In ,
December, 1703. George Reade, Senator from Dela- j
ware, resigned. The Legislature met January, 1704, ,
?nd adjourned without electing a Senator. The Gov
ernor thereupon appointed Mr. Kensey Johns to the
vacancy. The Senate refused to seat him because the
Legislature had been in session since the vacancy oc
curred and its failure to elect did not give the Gov
ernor jurisdiction to appoint. In the Senate at that
time were several members who had been members '
of the convention which framed the Federal constitu- :
tion, and for that reason the decision of this case has :
always been given special weight and has been held to
warrant the application of the principle of stare de- j
ciÂ«is to the issue.
The next leading case, in which a full discussion ;
has been preserved, was that of Mr. Lanman of Con- I
necticut. His term expired March 3, iB->j. On March j
4 the Governor appointed him to succeed himself.
His credentials were dated February 28, and he ap
peared on March 4 to take his seat at a special ses
sion called by the President. He was refused his
seat, on the ground that: "The Legislature of the
State, by making elections themselves, shall provide
for all vacancies which may occur at stated and known
periods, and that the expiration of a regular term of
service is not such a contingency as is embraced in
the third section of the first article of the constitu
tion."
This decision was acquiesced in for fifty years, dur
ing which time Governors in nine States refused to 1
appoint to fill vacancies caused by expiration of regu
lar terms.
But in no case has the Senate seated an appointee
of a Governor when the Legislature has been in ses
sion and had a chance to fill the vacancy, as decided
in the Kensey Johns case.
If Quay is seated it will be in violation of that pre
cedent established by men who helped make the con
stitution, and no less in violation of the plain letter of ;
that instrument.
Against this there have been long arguments in
defense of the right of a State to full representation
in the Senate. In the constitutional sense the Legis
lature is the constituent of the Senator, who repre
sents the State. If the Legislature refuse to elect a
Senator it is in exactly the position of a citizen who !
neglects to vote. Nobody deprives him of his suf
frage He simply consents to deprive himself of it.
So the omission of a Legislature to elect a Senator is '
a State's consent to be deprived, temporarily, of its
full suffrage in the Senate.
It is so clear that the Governor has no jurisdiction
unless the vacancy occur in recess of the Legislature
that the alleged bargain to sent Quay is an agree
ment to violate the constitution. It is said in the \
same connection that Senator Jones, chairman of the
National Democratic Committee, and Senator But- j
ler, chairman of the Populist National Committee, are
pledged to vote for Quay's admission. It is not re
markable that they should do so, for they represent !
platforms which directly attack the constitution in its
vital parts. But we cannot believe that Republican
Senators can consent to such a palpable breach of
precedent and violation of the constitution which they j
have sworn to support and profess to revere. Nor i
can we believe that the President is a party to a bar
gain in the interest of his renomination. which, if ear
ned out. would deservedly condemn him to defeat.
The country is surely not in a mood to see the con
stitution trampled under foot for the benefit of Quay, !
Addicks and Dan Burns.
TIIEBMTRAK CISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 29, 1899.
(\ BUG IN THE CHARTER.
THE Freeholders, by whom the new charter was
framed, were carefully selected. As a body they
were intelligent and respectable citizens. They
included some lawyers of more than ordinary ability
and learning. However much the theory or the de-.
I tails of the municipal government for which they pro
! vide<l may have been criticized, their zeal and good
| faith have not heretofore been questioned.
But there is no doubt that, in some irysterious way
that has not been explained, these gentlemen were
literally bunkoed by the Pacific Telephone and Tele
graph Company, which is an oppressive, exacting and
odious monopoly. That corporation, within the
limits of this city and county, has charged and col
lected exorbitant rates for very ordinary service. It
is invested with extensive franchises and privileges,
exercised for years, for which no just equivalent has
been rendered, and its practice has uniformly been to
take everything it could get and treat the public not
enly with indifference, but with ostentatious con
tempt.
One of the principal objects before the Freeholders
in the production of the new charter was to bring
every corporation that owed its existence and its op
portunities for profit to the municipality within the
control of the Board of Supervisors, and especially
in the matter of rates and charges. The principle
that they were within the power of municipal regula
tion was accepted as fundamental, and, except as to
the telephone company, it was firmly applied. A brief
examination of the new charter will prove that this
particular exemption was not the result of acci
dent. Telephone companies are the subject of specific
provisions. Among the grants of power to the Su
pervisors enumerated in article 11, chapter 2, section
I, by the thirteenth subdivision, the right to control
the location and quality of appliances for telephonic
and telegraphic service to the city and county is in
cluded. By article VI, chapter i, section g, the erec
tion of poles and the laying of underground wires are
placed under the supervision of the Board of Public
Works. Telephonic and telegraphic service is desig
nated also as one of the public utilities that the muni
cipality is ultimately to acquire.
But this is all. It is sufficient to demonstrate that
the attention of the Freeholders was especially di
rected to the telephone monopoly, and, therefore, that
the plain discrimination in its favor was deliberately
planned. This proposition is also fortified by other
provisions of the new charter. Subdivision 14 of
section 1 of article 11, chapter 2. the very next to the
subdivision already mentioned, gives the Supervisors
the amplest authority to determine rates or compen
sation for the vise of water, heat, light or power.
Subdivision 27 of section 1 confers the right, as re
spects street railways, "to fix, establish and reduce,"
not to increase, "the fares and charges." Section 6
of the same chapter emphasizes this function of the
Board of Supervisors by enacting that it "shall at all
times have the power to regulate the rates of fare."
and the next section carefully applies the same rule
to franchises or privileges for transmitting electric
power or for lighting purposes.
It was quite natural for the Pacific Telephone and
Telegraph Company to support the new charter.
When that instrument was adopted its unexpected at
titude may have been attributed to a lofty motive.
But it was really prompted by the most arrant self
ishness. Like Mr. Huntington, the telephone mon
opoly went for everything in sight, knew a good thing
when it had it. and was not in business for its health.
In the rush of work toward the end of their labors the
Freeholders were certainly hoodwinked, for it is in
conceivable that any of their number used their posi
tion as a Trojan horse. -^
It would be interesting to trace the responsibility
foi this betrayal of the public interests in the midst
of an achievement that was expected to clothe the
municipality with the spotless robes of immaculate
purity.
The more important practical consideration, how
ever, is the remedy. There are many citizens, includ
ing lawyers, who believe that under the present State
constitution the rates of telephone companies can be
regelated. That is a matter for the prompt considera
tion of the Board of Supervisors, with the aid of the
City and County Attorney. But the public, which
looks to positive and intelligible law, free from legal
quibbles, demands that the necessary steps be taken
to amend the charter and frustrate the deep-laid
scheme of the telephone monopoly without a mo
ment's unnecessary delay. The process is slow at
best, but it should be speedily and effectively invoked.
'INTERNAL vigilance will undoubtedly be the
price of securing a competitive railway fran
â* chise on Geary street. If the Supervisors grant
the application of the Market street combine for per
mission to build an electric road on that thoroughfare
between Taylor street and Grant avenue they may give
away the entire subject. There is reason to
believe that the Market street company has not aban
doned its plan of securing a long franchise on Geary
street, free from the restrictions which will be thrown
around it by the new charter. It is understood that
the present franchise, which expires in 1902, will be
surrendered some time during the next three or four
months and that the present Board of Supervisors
will be asked to advertise for the sale of a privilege
upon the street, extending over the time limited by
the new charter, which is twenty-five years.
Inasmuch as the Market street company now has a
road upon the street in actual operation, it is in a p<%
sition to bid higher for a new franchise than any com
peting company, and if an award is made at this time
it will undoubtedly be able to prevent the introduc
tion of a competitor. The situation will be changed
somewhat if the sale of a franchise is postponed until
the- expiration of the present privilege. The new char
ter will then be in effect, and there wÂ»U be some en
couragement for a competing corporation to make a
bid, with a view to securing the privilege. At all
events, the attempt of the Market street company to
gobble up this street without reference to the rights,
of the people who reside and own pioperty on it
should be thwarted.
It will be dangerous for the Board of Supervisors
to grant any privileges to the proposed "corkscrew"
line upon Geary street. That line is designed to run
over a route formerly covered by what was known as
the Central Railway Company, whose franchise on
Geary street does not expire for many years to come.
The Central company did not have the privilege of
using electricity, and to permit at the present time
the use of electricity on Geary street from Taylor to
Grant avenue may and probably will jeopardize a con
tinuous franchise for that street. No competing com
pany will desire to build a road over a line partly oc
cupied by the combine's cars.
Eternal vigilance, as we have said, is the solution
of this difficulty. The Supervisors will be recreant to
their trust if they are fooled into giving away Geary
street to this grasping corporation.
A few pessimists are of the opinion, judging from
the name of the cruiser bearing the Samoan Commis
sioners to Apia, that their High Mightinesses are in
a fair way to Badger somebody.

A FIGHT FOR
BLOOD MONEY ON
COLUMBIA RIVER
Heavy Demands by
Boarding Masters.
CAPTAINS SEEKING MEN HERE
I
CREWS BEING SENT NORTH TO
MAN THE SHIPS.
! America Maru Arrives and Coptic
Sails for the â President
Farrell o*: the Pacific Coast
Company Here.
; ,
The trouble between the shipmasters
and boarding masters on the Columbia ;
River has been transferred in a measure :
to San Francisco. As stated in yester
day's Call, the boarding masters will not
accept the month's advance allowed by
law, but are demanding $100 "blood
money." The captain of the British ship [
Balmoral tried to escape paying the tax ''â 
by bringing nine men from San Francisco â 
to fill the vacancies in his crew, but he j
failed. The boarding masters were wait
ing for the men and enticed them away
as soon as they set foot on shore.
The venture of Captain Campbell of
the Balmoral was watched with a great
deal of interest, as seven other vessels
want crews, and their captains refuse to i
pay $1W for each sailor put aboard by the
boarding master. The vessels lying in i
the Columbia River and either loading or |
loaded for Europe are the Balmoral, How- j
ard D. Troop, Varana. British Princess, I
Wallacetown, Iverna and Marechal Su
chet.
Like the Balmoral, the Howard D. I
Troop is ready to sail and Captain Corn- j
ing wants seventeen men. He refused to j
pay the blood money, and he and the :
boarding masters had a lively alterca- I
tion, which resulted in the price of each j
sailor being advanced $12. Captain Corn- i
ing then determined to secure a crew :
from this port and the boarding masters
determined to balk him. ;
The master of the Howard D. Troop j
went to work very quietly and sent his |
chief officer and an agent to San Fran- i
Cisco to secure a crew of seventeen men. !
The mate had instructions not to stick at !
a few dollars' advance in wages, but to â 
bring back the men and so outwit the \
boarding masters. The latter were not
Idle, however, and as soon as the mate ]
and the agent started for this city Dick j
McCarron and two other boarding mas- !
ters were on their track. Thursday the |
mate of the Howard D. Troop secured a |
number of sailors and yesterday morn- |
Ing he started them for Astoria on the |
steamer State of California, in charge of !
the agent. On the same steamer went ;
one of the Columbia River boarding mas- j
ters. He says he will get to the ear of ;
the sailors, and that when Astoria is !
reached not one of the men will join the j
vessel.
Tuesday next the mate of the Troop
and the remainder of the crew will start
for Astoria on the Grace Dollar and on !
the same ship will go Dick McCarron and :
I the rest of the boarding masters. They |
will undoubtedly prevent the sailors from j
I joining the Troop, and in consequence thÂ»
i ship will have a big expense bill piled up |
j against her, and Captain Corning will be j
! no better off than he was before the fight
! began. He is a fighter, however, and as
Baifour. iuthrle & Co., Glrvin & Eyre, |
G. W. McNear and other large charterers I
of vessels are on his side, the battle is i
likely to be a bitter one. On th. next at
tempt to send men from here the chances
are that the vessel will be at anchor at
the mouth of the Columbia River and .1
tug will be there ready to take her to
sea. Then as soon as the steamer ar- ;
rives from San Francisco the sailors will .
be bundled aboard the tug and they will i
S be transferred to the waiting ship, which
will then put to sea.
The Japanese mail steamer America
i Maru arrived from the Orient yesterday
I afternoon. She brought up 116 cabin pas- i
sengers, the majority of whom came |
from Honolulu, and 223 Chinese in the j
steerage. It took a long time to transfer j
the Chinese to the quarantine station and I
It was after 5 p. m. before the steamer]
got to her dock. Shy was twenty-nine i
days from Hongkong, seventeen days ;
fro"m Yokohama and six days one hour
from Honolulu. During the early part of (
the Voyage the America Maru encoun- i
tered strong east-northeast winds and a
rough head sea and throughout the last
twenty-four hours .he had to buck a i
strong northwest gale and a high con- j
fused sea. - ' ' '. ' â , , i
The Occidental and Oriental Steamship j
Company's steamer Coptic sailed for the j
Orient yesterday. She carried a very ,
large cargo and a great many passengers. ;
Never in the history or the port has the j
freight and passenger traffic between San
Francisco and the Orient been as heavy
es it is at the present lime. |
Captain Charles Austin has taken com- |
mand of the schooner John G. North and
will take her to Hawaii. He replaces Cap
tain Christiansen, who retires. Captain
Austin is very popular in the sugar trade,
having been eight years mate of the Al
-1 den Besse and one year master of the
Maid of Orleans.
President J. Farrell of the Pacific Coast
Company arrived from Puget Sound last
Thursday on a tour of inspection. He
looked over all the company's steamers
yesterday and from here will go to Port
Harford, where he will inspect the San
Luis Obispo Railroad.
CYCLERS MUST NOT SCORCH.
Park Commissioners Will Not Allow
Fast Riding on Any of the
Drives.
The {'ark Commissioners, thoughtful of
their duty to the people who seek the pub
lic playground for recreation, have de-
Cided not to countenance fast riding of :
bicyclists on any of the driveways.
Representatives of the organized wheel
men have aKked that they be allowed to
ride at any rate of speed on the south I
(irlve, which skirts the children's? play
ground, them 'â¢ out by the baseball ground j
and around Strawberry Hill to the beach.
The C 'mmissioners, denied the request on '
the ground that ladieÂ« driving through the
nark often select the less frequented ',
drive, and fast riding would, sooner or !
later, result in an accident. The ocean
boulevard was thrown open to the wheel- j
m*n. They may ride over this at any I
rate of speed they can raise.
Trouble Over Furniture.
D. H. Bibb, lumber merchant, and C. R.
Dexter were arrested yesterday on war
rants charging them with petty larceny.
The complaining wittiest is F. Rreschke,
who represent* himself and other nvn who
have been making furniture at Stockton
and Fort Point from lumber supplied by
Bibb. He Bays Bibb claimed to have a
lien on the furniture and yesterday with
a gang of men forcibly removed it with
out paying fur the labor.

HIS REMAINS
TO BE EXHUMED
AND REBURIED
W. Tiedemann's Body
Hawked About.
NO RESPICT FOR THE DEAD
TROUPL^ BETWEEN CORONER
AND UNDERTAKER.
The Official Had the Remains In
terred by a Rival Firm ana jxietz
ler Secures a Singular
Order From Court.
Coroner Hill and Herman Metzler, an
undertaker, are having war over the
corpse of William Tiederrdr. â , who died
in the Prescott House on April J.,. On the
21st the body was buried in Laurel Hill
Cemetery from the California Undertak
ing Parlors, and on that fact hinges the
animosity of Metzler and his determina
tion to secure possession of the remains of
William Tledemann.
Metzler was called in by the clerk of the
Prescott House when Tiedemann was
found dead. He immediately notified the
Public Administrator, who took charge of
the effects of the deceased/amounting to
$5iÂ«W in bank and other personal property.
The Coroner was called later and the dep
uty carted the body to the California I n
dertaklng Parlors and refused Metzler in
formation as to its whereahouts. Metzler
then obtained an order from the Public
Administrator for possession of the body
for interment. He presented this to the
Coroner, who Informed him that he had
the absolute right to dispose of the body
for burial.
Metzler made implication yesterday be
fore Judge Murasky for the disinterment
of the body and a second burial from his
parlors. Judge Murasky granted the re
quest.
Metzler Is now armed with permits from
the Health Department to exhume the
body, which he intends to do this morning.
Coroner Hill says he will prevent it. He
telephoned to the Laurel Hill Cemetery
superintendent yesterday not to allow the
exhumation and he will be on hand to as
sert his authority.

ney Ach was present nnd asked for a

penter promptly replied that he \v;is
ready to proceed and Ach then asked that
the case of A. Ankle be set for trial, as

Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter object
ed and said the cases would have to lie
trk-d in their order mO hÂ« moved that

noon. May 6. The other canes were set
in their order, the last being on June 1.
Attorney Ach announced that Tuesday
morning he would lile iffldavits asking
that the Sheriff instead of the police serve
the venire on the ground of prejudice on
th.' part of the police. This Is following
th( mode of operations he adopted In
Judge Slogan's court.

'X'HE pleasant method and beneficial effects of the well-known remedy, Syrup of Figs, manufactured
â *â  by the California Fig Syrup Company, illustrate the value of obtaining the liquid laxative principles
of plants known to be medicinally laxative and presenting them in the form most refreshing to the taste
and acceptable to the system. It is the one perfect strengthening laxative,
CLEANSING THE SYSTEM EFFECTUALLY, DISPELLING
COLDS AND HEADACHES, PREVENTING FEVERS,
OVERCOMING HABITUAL CONSTIPATION PERMANENTLY.
Its perfect freedom from every objectionable quality and substance, and its acting on the kidneys,
liver and bowels, gently yet promptly, without weakening or irritating them, make it the ideal laxative.
In the process of manufacturing figs are used, as they are pleasant to the taste, but
THE MEDICINAL QUALITIES ARE OBTAINED FROM SENNA AND OTHER AROMATIC PLANTS,
by a method known to the California Fig Syrup Company only. In order to get its beneficial effects, and
to avoid imitations, please remember the full name of the Company printed on the front of every package.
Consumers of the choicest products of modern commerce purchase at about the same price that others
my for cheap and worthless imitations. To come into universal demand and to be everywhere considered
â he best of its class, an article must be capable of satisfying the wants and tastes of the best informed
purchasers. The California Fig Syrup Company having met with the highest success in the manufacture
:nd sale of its excellent liquid laxative remedy, Syrup of Figs, it has become important to all to have a
knowledge of the Company and its product. The California Fig Syrup Company was organized more than
fifteen years ago, for the special purpose of manufacturing and selling a laxative remedy which would be
more pleasant to the taste and more beneficial in effect than any other known. The great value of the
remedy, as a medicinal agent and of the Company's efforts, is attested by the sale of millions of bottles
nnually, and by the high approval of most eminent physicians. As the true and genuine remedy named
Syrup of Figs i. c manufactured by the California Fig Syrup Company only, the knowledge of that fact
â¢..ill assist in avoiding the worthless imitations manufactured by other parties.

EASTERN MARKETS.
NEW STORK STOCK MARKET.
KEW YORK, April 2S.â lrregularity pervaded
to-day's deaJing i>n the Stock Exchange and |
The temper of the market was extremely pro- i
fessional, resulting in net changes, with losses
predominating. London traded both ways and
commission house business was on a very re
stricted scale. Traders were disjkised to let
stocks g-> in anticipation of an unfavorable
bank statement to-morrow, and large oper
ators changed places and -â -. the bear side,
The bank statements are usually unreliable, |
but bank reports for the week seemed to Indi- ]
cate a loss in cash on all accounts of nearly
{3,500,000. Anaconda minim? fluctuated widely,
ending with a net gain of nearly 3 points on
th^ announcement of the large copper combina
tion. Silver certificates sold at to at one time, :
the highest price recorded in a long time. The
passage of the franchise tax bill by the Leg
islature was responsible for weakness In most
of the local stocks, there being declines of 5
points in Brooklyn Union Gas, ::\ t in Metropoli
tan an.l nearly as much in Consolidated Gas
and in Manhattan, although it left off only
1% down. Third Avenue, on the contrary robe
2 Points. Another reason for weakness In Man
hattan wis the adverse report of the Board
of KtÃlth on Its Ninth-avenue structure. The
unnounrement of a settlement of a litigation
hem Brooklyn Transit up In spite of thf> weak
ness in similar shares generally and the stock
trained over a point. Except Colorado Fuel and
Iron improvement was noted in the Iron and
Ht-el properties. Other strong spots were New
Jersey C-ntral, lowa Central and Northern Pa- '
cific. The trenernl railway list was Inclined to
droop on moderate dealings. The market closed
heavy.
To-day's bond market lacked a decisive tone,
but the undertone of the market was healthful :
anl seme Issues were in keen demand. Bust- |
rÂ»r-s expands from day to day. To-day's I
transactions reached $4,375,000.

THE LONDON MARKET.
NEW YORK. April 28.â The Commercial Ad
vertiser's London financial cablegram says:
The market here had a general setback to-day,
partly due to vague rumors of Transvaal po
litical trouble, but mainly on account of the
closing of books before the holiday on Monday.
The inactivity in Americans defies description.
They were neglected and heavy throughout, ex
cept for slight New York support in Northern
Pacific and Erie. Copper shares are elapsed. j
Anaconda closed at 1- 15-18. Tintons opened at !
47 and closed at 4SV&.
Silver was very active, 2,000,000 ounces chang- !
ing hands. The buying was nearly all mdi- j
rectly from New York. It is reported that a j
bear dealer here is already in difficulties. The
morning price was 25%. It has since been 29-,*. :
and closed at 29 1-16. Two hundred thousand '
pounds In gold was taken for the Cape. It Is
expected that a parcel due to-morrow will go
to the Bank.

BRADSTREET'S FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, April 28.â Bradstreet's Finan
cial Review will say to-morrow: Speculation
this week developed narrow and Irregular tend
encies. The easing of the money market, ;
larger supplies of funds and a noticeable relax
ation of the disiwsition to reject Industrial
stocks as collateral had a favorable Influence,
which was partially overcome by the continued ;
uncertainty about the crops and the evident
â¢ falling off -In the public interest. The latter !
i fact was reflected by the much smaller volume
I of dally transactions and the comparatively
I irresponsive state of the market. The most
significant feature of . the week was the de
cided activity and strength of the bond list.
The recent change In the savings bank Invest
ment laws of New York anil Massachusetts, j
which opens to the savings Institutions of these j
States the bonds of dividend-paying railroads,
is to a large extent responsible for the move
ment in question, though this would only ac
count indirectly for the, in some cases, heavy <
appreciation In many issues of bonds . which \
have on the whole a semi-speculative position ;
In the market. The abundance of funds for
investment and the temporary diversion of pub- :
lie buying power from stocks to the bond list !
would seem also to be a factor in the matter, '
the effect, as usual In such cases, being to sus- '
tain the general range of stock quotations. The
market, however, was of an irregular kind.
The grangers were neglected and the same
applies to the Pacific stocks, while, on the other |
hand, the coal shares showed a tendency to j
appreciate on the better earnings which are
said to be rewarding the companies and the I
prospective issue of "rights" by the Jersey
Central. What are termed the "Flower" 'â 
stocks, including Brooklyn Rapid Transit,
People's Gas, New York Air Brake and Fed
eral Steel, were the objects of renewed bull- i
ish manipulation, and Sugar Refining, though ;
inactive, displayed a great deal of strength
1 Anaconda mining shares were a feature, ad- ':
vancing from 52 to 65% on the large buying
both here and in London, supposed to come
from interests â  which are arranging the new
copper mine combination. Otherwise London
was not a factor in our market, though foreign
interests were buyers of . Louisville and Nash
ville, Southern Railway preferred and Nor
i folk and Western, selling at the same time !
! high-grade bonds at the advances In that part 1
of the market. The sharp advance in the price â 
. of silver caused not a little notice to be paid
I to the securities of the Mexican roads and
: Mexican Central stock and bonds were con
spicuously strong under a good buying de- !
mand. ' . .
BRADSTREET'S ON TRADE CONDITIONS.
NEW YORK, April 28.â Bradstreet's to-mor
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 29, 1899.
row will say: Favorable weather conditions
find reflection in reoorts of good retail distri
bution of spring and summer- goods and in fair
rllllng-in orders from jobbers. Demand from
first hpnds for general merchandise Is If any
thing quieter, in keeping with the "between
season" period now at hand. Industrial ac
tivity continues specially marked, a pleasing
feature this week being the practical absence
of the unrest, particularly In the building
trades, noted for many years past about May 1.
While favoring retail distribution, the spring
like weather conditions, ' however, have been
the reverse of stimulaton as regards quota
tions of two of the country's greatest staples,
wheat and cotton. In these and in hog prod
ucts the tendency of values has been toward
a lower ranee. Winter wheat crop advices
have continued regularly unfavorable, hut good
weather, enabling a large area to be planted in
spring wheat, coupled with rather less active
export demand and denials of damage to Euro
pean crops, have weakened quotations of wheat
and flour at the leading Eastern and interior
markets.
New demands have been notably quiet in iron
and steel this week, the most notable feature
being large sales of Southern gray forge iron
at Pittsburs. Prices exhibit all their
old strength, and here the margin of profit on
finished products is undoubtedly very good.
The strength of the lumber market shows lit
tle Impairment. Wool as a whole is quiet and
steady, but a relatively higher range of values
abroad is indicated by. continued sales of Aus
tralian bonded wool to be re-exported. Copper
la notable among: the products advancing this
week, aided therein by large consumptive de
mand, but chiefly by talk of the great con
solidation of copper producing companies an
nounced toward the close of the week. Leather
is firmly held, strength being imparted to this
Hnd finished products by the small stocks or
hides available.
Partially compensating for the falling off in
exports of natural products, particularly ce
reals, Is the immense expansion in exports of
manufactured goods. . Shipments of such goods
in March ranged over $36,000,000, or 35 per cent
of all our exports, a proportion rarely If ever
approached before, and in view of probably
smaller takings of our natural products, fore
shadowing even more marked expansion in the
future, providing that prices do not advance
to a point prohibitive of free shipments.
Wheat, including flour, shipments for the
week aggregated 3.025.250 bushels, against 2,
--932,959 bushels last week, 4,449,009 bushels In the
corresponding week of 1898, 1,156.866 bushels In
1897, 1,260,449 bushels in 1896, .and 2,555,660 bush
els in 1895.
Since July 1 this season the exports of wheat
aggregate 96,290,281 bushels, against 195,592.695
bushels last year.
Business failures for the week number 184, as
compared with 187 last week. 245 in this week a
year ago, 244 in 1896, and 206 In 1895.
Canadian failures number 27, against SO last
week 22 in this week a year ago, 31 In 1597,
26 in 1896. and 36 in 1896,
DUN'S WEEKLY REVIEW OF TRADE.
NEW YORK, April 28.â R. G. Dun & Co.'S
Weekly Review of Trade will say:
All elements considered, it is rather sur
prising that business has not been set back
a little. The uncertainty about Samoa and
the prolonging of the difficulty in the Philip
pines might have counted for something, as
have the rising imports and falling exports,
the rise in foreign exchange, by some attributed â 
to foreign sales of copper stocks, and the hin
drance of manufacturing orders owing to the |
recent advance in prices.
But there has been full faith that foreign ;
difficulties would soon be cleared away, and j
the movement in exchange is generally con
nected with speculative rather than legitimate
operation; since accounts of trade still Indi- ;
cate a large excess of exports. After every ,
rise In prices manufacturers have to consider
whether hindered consumption with increased
production will make them difficult, but con
fidence with which combinations are formed
and extended still shows prevailing belief that
no danger point is near. â 
The state of foreign trade justifies confidence
rather than apprehension. It is the season
for th.- lowest export of staples and their
prices this year are extremely low, but the I
unprecedented foreign demand for manufac
tured products BO far compensates them. Ex
cess of imports in March was heavy and ap
parently hits been Inappropriate. The pres
ence of English merchants in Boston trying
to Bell English medium wool which would be
delivered there at about 32 cents, at the same
time that English buyers were taking a lit
tle fine territory for export, and German buy
ers of 300,000 pounds more Australian from bond,
shows the opposite trend of popular taste in
different countries. Clay worsteds here ad
vanced 7'-e. and serges sc, which strengthened
the tone of the wool market. The wool is,
relatively cheap "here and dear abroad, but |
concessions make the lowest prices of the year j
in all kinds, as heavy stocks carried for years
come into the presence of new wool, said to be
3(10.000,000 pounds. Manufacturers are not now
buying largely, though in four weeks 30,918,785 I
pounds were sold, of which 23,315,085 were
domestic, against 41,715,650 in the same weeks
two years ago, when wool was rising. Besse
mer pig is unchanged at Pittsburgh and gray
forge stro.-.g at $14 50, though 16,000 tons South
ern have been sold .iere at $14 20. There are
some large structural orders â a Philadelphia
building, for 17,000 tons, a Western bridge for
7000 tons, a Duluth elevator and the St. Law
rence bridge at Quebec though the general
run of orders in this line is light and no
large sales are reported, though Inquiries for j
000 tons are said to be in this market. Ad
vanced prices are noted in pipe ami decrease
in merchant orders, with small business in
and at the West in bars pending the
completion of the combination. But the gen- 1
oral decrease in new demand raises the ques- |
tion whether prices will be maintained after
current orders run out
Failures tor the week were IK4 in the United I
States", against Lfi2 last year; and 23 in Can- I
ada, against 16 last '-ear.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April 23. Wheat was easy at the
opening owing to a large increase in Argen

from Kansas and delayed seeding in the
Northwest on account of snow. May opened

realizing checked the advance, and then weak

upturn which was vigorously contested for
a while, but finally shorts ran to cover and

There is no tonnage offering and exporters are

out of it for milling purposes. Walla Walla

Harrison's circular says: ."During the week
there have been four .arrivals of coal from
Washington, with 12,550 tons; four from British
Columbia, 12,772 tons; three from Newcastle,
N. S. W.. 7952 tons; total, 33,274 tons. Under
ordinary circumstances the arrivals this week
would cause considerable of same to be yarded,
but the liberal deliveries to the Government
transports will leave but a small quantity to
go Into yard. Outside of the navy contracts
there is no change in the coal market, prices
are stationary and deliveries from yard are
about as usual, with the exceptions of two days
this week, which were showery, and caused
an Increased demand for household fuel. There
Is an increased inquiry for tonnage for coal
carriage from the coast colliers and better rates
are being offered. This Is caused by a scarcity
of local ships which were formerly engaged in
this trade, but have been diverted Into lumber
carrying principally to Australia, for which
generous rates have been paid. These will all
have arrived back with coal cargoes before the
end of the year. Our dealers have been some
what misled anticipating a softening of coal
freights from Australia and Great Britain, as
rates this week are quoted higher than last.
It was anticipated that grain shippers would be
chartering freely for the exportation of our in
coming grain at full figures, whereas the pres
ent Liverpool market offers them but little In
ducements to do so."

UNIVERSITY CADETS
IN A SHAM BATTLE
BERKELEY CAMPUS IS THE
SCENE OF MIMIC WAR.
BERKELEY, April 25.-Mnjor Edward
Field conducted the annual Inspection of
the University Corps of Cadets upon the
Berkeley campus to-day. The exercises
lasted through morning 1 and afternoon,
and were witnessed by a large number of
visitors. .
The troops assembled on the parade
ground shortly before 10 a. m., marching
in regiment formation to the lower cam
pus. Here they prepared for Inspection,
undergoing a most thorough examination .
of arms and uniforms at the hands if the j
inspecting officer. After two hours of
close inspection. Major Field pronounced
the condition of the department to be
thoroughly excellent, and spoke in high
terras of the appearance and bearing of
Previous to the sham battle, held in
the afternoon, the regiment was formed
for parade and review in honor of the
visiting ollicer. After exercises in bat- j
tallon movements under Major "William I
Ede ami Major W. Hackley, each com- I
nany was called out to contest for the
banner in competitive company drill. '
Company H of the second battalion, com
manded by Captain Oliver w. Dibble,
proved itself the most efficient and was
awarded the much coveted right of car- I
rying the colors next year.
Withdrawing for a while, the troops '
ranged themselves for the sham engage- j
ment. which proved the most interesting
oxercise of the day. Plenty of ammunl- !
tlon was provided to make the battle re
alistic. The defense took a position
Btretching across the center of the cam
pus, from which they awaited an attack
by a battalion of live companies from
below.
The attacking party, under Major Ede,
sent forward half its force in battalion
formation to dislodge the enemy, keeping
the remainder in reserve. In face of their
advance the defense withdrew tempora
rily to a strongly .... position in their
rear, rallying here in sufficient strength
to repel the advance. The attacking com
panies then retreated until the reserve
came up, two platoons from Company A
having meanwhile taken posit 1 by the
trees on the flank of the defense. From
here they pourod shot at the defense in
order to cover the retreat. As soon as
the reserve lent its support the whole at
tacking force advanced by rushes up the
hill, firing round after round. They com
peted the assault by a grand charge
which routed tho Demy, forcing it to
surrender.
Major Field, as soon as the battle was
over, made a sbort address to the troops
in which he complimented their work.
The exercises closed by the ceremony of
pn luting the flag, the band playing and
the troop.s presenting arms as the colors
â were dipped.
As the result of the year's work Pro
fr-FHor Frank Soule, commandant of the
corps, has sent the names of the follow

NO SOLACE FOR JURORS.
Judge Quinn Says They Were Either
Corrupt or Imbeciles.
OAKLAND. April 25. --"Crooked and
corrupt" rings in the ears of five jurors
who sat in Judge Quinn's court yester
day, and the sound does not please them.
William P. Courtney, one of these jur
ors, visited Judge Qulnn this afternoon
and sought a modulation of the expres
sion. ...
Judge Quinn was in no humor to modify
his language. "Get out of here," he said.
â¢I don't wish to see you around , this
court, i said you were crooked and cor
rupt and 1 meant it. I will stand by what
1 have said." _ , L. v .
In discussing the matter Judge Quinn
said the verdict in the Alice Moss case
was so thoroughly at variance with the
evidence and the court's instructions that
: if the jurors were not crooked and corrupt
! the" were absolutely devoid of intelli
ren'ce He said there were no middle
grounds If the jurors think themselves
aggrieved. Judge yuinn says, the law pro-
I vi<?es ample remedy for their alleged
i grievances.
A STRETCH OF TRACK
SINKS OUT OF SIGHT
' WRECK ON THE NARROW-GAUGE
BARELY AVERTED.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
142S Park street, April 28. .
The Santa Cruz train on the narrow- ;
gauge line, <lue at 10:50 this morning, '
barely escaped being wrecked at the
â¢â¢sink," about a quarter of a mile south
of the Pirn Leandro bridge, on the Bay
1 Farm Island marshes. The sink has been
a source of annoyance to the railroad
ever since the arrow-gauge line was put
in operation. It is a stretch of roadbed
about a hundred yards in length and ap
parently lilt on mud that covers a bot
tomless pit. A fortune h;is been expend
ed In lilling the place without producing
any substantial result. Several wrecks
have occurred at the place, and on one
occasion a fireman was pinned under his j
engine and drowned by the incoming tide. ',
Two trains passed over the road this ;
morning- but a short time ahead of th'i
Santa Cruz .special. The engineer of the
Santa Cruz train was keeping a sharp
lookout and discovered that the roadbed
had sunk almost out of sight. He ap
plied the air, bringing the train to a
stop just as the' forward trucks of the
locomotive reached the treacherous spot.
One of the train hands was sent to
Alameda. and a local train was backed
down the line to bring the passengers
into town. No through trains were run
over the road until late this evening.

days of the old Toland college at
North Beach Dr. Cole was always
firmly opposed to lady students. When
the new college was planned Dr. ColÂ«
had two rooms Curnlshed in a style
which made even the most conserva

planation was finally drawn from him.
"Hem-hem. This room," he says, "is
for the yOUOg women to retire to

to abstract locks from one another's

by saying: "True, trueâ very true.

Oakland Ofllce 3an Francisco Call,
90S Broadway. April 28.
The remarkable rise in the value of
Contra Costa water stock has Bet the
people of this city to wondering. The fig
ures in the accompanying table show bet
ter than anything else could do the re
markable effects of tights in the Council
over water rates. The rapid rise in the
value of the stock at this time is a per
fect enigma, for unless there be some
facts unknown to the public the income
of the company after the 30th of June will
be less than It is at this time.
On July 1 a new ordinance will go into
effect, which is said to be considerably
lower than the ordinance adopted by the
"Solid Six" last year, and which caused
several riots. Yet the value of the stock
has increased nearly 50 per cent since the
last day of last'year, and why this should
be with the prospect of a decreased In
come is hard to understand.
On the 9th of next-month, according to
President "Watkinson of the consolidated
companies, the papers will be (lied annex
ing the Oakland Water Company to the
old corporation, and at the same time
Messrs May ward and Dingee will receive
their one and a half millions in stock. At
the present valuation this represents a
value of $1072,500, upon which, according
to the State law. "reasonable interest"
must be paid. As neither company has
paid any interest for several years, it Is
hard to understand, with the new.ordin
ance going Into effect, how such an im
mense capitalization can be made to pro
duce an income for its holders. Yet that
such an income is expected is very evi
dent from the rapid rise in the market
value of the stock. ~Vr-
The Contra Costa Company has discov
ered that it has a claim against the city
of Oakland for $127,000.. This amount is
being carried on tts books and Is for water

The "sweet little revenge" was

The luncheon was given in the "hair

chicken and the strawberries, but
something was missing. Finally he

supplied in past years during periods
when the city treasury was empty and
the company "charitably donated the mu
nicipal water supply. It is not known
whether the company will try to collect
this amount from the city, but it exists
as a debt, and now that there is no com

It on every occasion when the fixing of
rates comes up in the City Council.
CALIFORNIA'S MINERALS.
Last Year's Record of Production
Shows an Increase.
The State Mining Bureau has issued the
record of California's mineral product for
1898, as compiled by its statistician,
Charles G. Yale. It shows a gratifying
increase in the production of mineral
wealth.
During IS9B thirty-seven mineral sub
stances were commercially produced on
a scale worthy of record. The valuation
of the total mineral product is $27,289,079.
In 1897 it was $25,142,441, In 1896 $24.28-1,398,
In 1896 $22,844,664.
The gold product Is placed at $15,90*.4 .?.
a slight increase over the $15,871,401 in 1897.
As the drought of last year lessened the
product by some millions this demon
strates an active development of gold
mining.
Copper takes second place for the first
time with a product of 21,543,229 pounds,
valued at $2,475,168. a very great Increase.
Petroleum increased to 2,249,088 bar
rels, valued at $2,376,420. Quicksil
ver, so long second in importance,
holds third place. The product increased
to 31,092 flasks, worth $1,188,626. Other Im
portant products follow: Asphalt, $482
--175: silver, $414,055; rubble, $445,395; brick,
$571,362; coal, $337,475.
The banner county for all mineral prod
ucts was Shasta, with $3,510,723 to its
credit. Other ranks are: Nevada, $2,072,
--604; Amador, $1,849,846; Tuolumne, $1,757.
--735; Los Angeles, $1,732,357, etc. While
Nevada leads in gold, Shasta's additional
copper puts it ahead.

CYCLERS' ROAD RACES.
Training for the Big Hundred Mile
Relay Race May 14.
The annual relay race of the Associated
Wheelmen will take place this year on
Bunday, -May 14, and five prominent clubs
â earns In training for the event.
They are the Olympic, Bay City, Garden
City, Reliance and Acme wheelmen. There
i.s also a possibility that the California.
Encinal and Imperial clubs will enter :
teams.
In <â  msequence of the near approach of
the race the clubs that have decided to j
entei will all hold road races to-morrow
over the Sun Leandro-Haywards course.
The Olympics will have a ten-mile try
out around the triangle; tii>- Hay Cltya a
Jive-mile unpaced event'from San Leandro
to Haywards, straight away. The Acme
and Reliance clube will both have ten
mile try-outs, and the Garden Cltya will
train their men over the East San Jose
course. All of these events will tak>: place
to-morrow forenoon, the San Francisco
contingent going over on the 9 a. m. broad
gauge <
No correct idea of the formation of the
teams can he had until a few days before
the race itself. Any one familiar with the
sport and the racing men can guess at
seven or eight men who will undoubtedly
ride on each team on account of their
known ability, but the two odd ones will
me almost impossible to decide upon even
with the club managers themselves until
the last momi nt.
Chairman Loop of the racing board.
accompanied by J. H. Xa?h, will ride
around the l(K>-mile relay course to-mor
| row to Bee thai everything is in order.
Will Play Handball at Ryan's.
The usual Sunday afternoon handball

Anxious Mrs. Jones.
The following letter was received by the
Coroner yesterday:
SAN FRANCISCO. April 27, 18M.
Coroner Hill â Dear Sir: I am very much |
wrought up over the disappearance of my I
daughter, Mrs. Tom Bozzle. She has been |
away from home for two days and I fear she j
has committed suicide. Please do all in your
power to help me find her, dead or alive. Her
anxious mother, MRS. ANNIE JONES.
It Is believed to be a faked letter, writ
ten by some one whose idea of humor is :
the giving of trouble to others. The Cor
oner has done nothing: to find the one who
wrote the letter, and as there was no ad
dress given no more attention will be paid
to it. %fr-Jm

Another FhnfTio and cut of the leaâtie

Eightlng for second place. San Jose is all [
by itself, having broken even on the num- i
her of games won and lost, while Oak
land and Sacramento are doins a double
Ptunt in the last notch. The taJlenders,
however, are so well up that the finish
of the present week's series is likely to
find one or the other up among the lead
ers, if not actually in first place The
crank who would undertake to name the
leader a month from now must be gifted
with supernatural powers. The games

Manager Harris has made a great find
and Pop Swett will not get back Into the
game. Pop found it too great a task to
pet into .-thing like his old condition, bo
he gave it up. Last week Harris was in a
quandary; having no catcher, so in des
peration he signed young Charles Swin
dell of the Stanford University team for
the Sacramento series. The youngster
made an excellent showing and Harris
at once cured him for the season. In
addition to being a. hard hitter Swindell is
an exceptionally strong and accurate '
thrower to bases, and above ail he is a
fast man on the paths. Hitherto this ha*
been a decided weakness in the team, but
Hank thinks Swindell will help the entire i
team in that line.
The new Oakland grounds at Golden
Gate will be formally opened next Sun-
Say morning by the Oaklands and Sacra
mentos in a regular league test. Ewing
has secured one of the prettiest sites in
the State for a ball park. The entire in-
I'losure is as level as a floor and the out
tield Is covered with .1 luxuriant crop of
grass, which, however, is kept closely
cut. This week he is having sawdust
worked Into the soil on the diamond and
by Sunday the grounds will be in perfect
condition.
Sacramento will present several changes
In Its make-up this week. Manager
Kripp has written to Harris that he has
linally secured Harvey and that he will
probably pitch one of the games against
Oakland. Krlpp has also secured a new
Inflf-lder, but has not made his name pub
lic yet.
Santa Cruz has one great advantage
over the other league teams in having
heavy hitting batteries. As a rule ball
teams do not rely much on the stick work
of the men in the points, but Donlin and :
Balsz are exceptionally heavy hitters,
while Pace can find the ball with any of
them. Daubenbis; the reserve pitcher, is
also a good sticker.
Krug of San Francisco continues to
land on the ball hard and often. Last
Sunday at Sacramento he put it up
against the left field fence three times, j
Krug is making me errors at short, but '
he never thinks of his record, going for
everything In sight and covering more
ground and accepting more chances than
any other intielder in the league.
The Oak! cripples are rapidly round-
Ing into form again and ihe team is prac
ticing at Recreation Park every after
noon, while their own diamond is being
put into first-class condition. Donovan
has almost entirely recovered from his
Charley horse, while Billy Hammond's
hand Is about healed up.
Dunleavy, who sprained his ankle three
weeks ago, has recovered, and will regu
larly play left field in place of Borland,
who has been released. With Donovan at
center and Hardin at right, where he will
be stationed permanently; this will give
Oakland one of the best run-getting out
fields in the league, as well as a sure
fielding and accurate long-distace throw-
Ing trio.
Fred Swanton tells a funny story of
how Donlin got into the. game. The big
pitcher was formerly a foot-racer and
â¢with a companion started south to
"work" the orange-growers. While in
Los Angeles the ball team there had some
hard luck and somebody asked Donlin if
he could play, as the â  â¢ atn had a game on
for that day and nobody to fill up the
gap. Donlin said he could play all right,
though In truth he nad never played a
game In his life. However, he went into
right field and managed to accept the
only chance offered, an easy fly. The op
posing team had a "dub" In the box and
Donlin fairly slaughtered him every time
he went to bat. Two days later they got
Donlin into another game and th( Los
Angeles pitcher was disabled almost at
the start. The captain asked Donlin if
he could pitch and again received an af
firmative reply. Donlin was hard as a
rock and although he had never pitched
a ball before he had terrific speed and
nobody could touch him. During the game
he noticed thai some of the halls he threw
â would start In a line and suddenly shoot
off to one side. From that time he began
to practice pitching and now his curves
are simply marvelous. And he is only a
novice yet.
The following letter has been received
by President Moran of the California
League showing that the league is now
under th. protection of the National
agreement:

GAGE SELECTS
MEN FOR THE
HEALTH BOARD
Three of the Positions
Filled.
BURNS' PHYSICIAN CARED FOR
DRS. COFFEY, KEENEY AND BAR
BAT DRAW THE PRIZES.
The Other Appointments to Be Made
by Next Monday â Prominent
Applicants for the
Places.
Governor Gage has given the plum tree
another '.ike and throe juicy morsels
have dropped into outstretched hands.
Needless to say thai the successful reach
ers wore not hold back any by a certain
"colonol" lot unknown to the authorities
of California and Mexico and the railroad.
Word went out last night that three
members of the local Board of Health
' had been selected and that the others
I would be named by .Monday at the latest.
The three who have already been ap
pointed are Dr. Barbat, Dr. W. B. Coffey
and Dr. J. W. Kecney.
Dr. Barbat is the family physician of
,P. M. Burns, while Dr. Coffey is chief
Burgeon for the Market-street Railway
Company. Dr. Keeney is a stepson of
Police Commissioner Alvord and" is ex
amlnii physician for the Police Depart
ment.
Of the aspirants for the remaining posi
tions on the Board of Health there are
four whose prospects are conceded to be
'exceptionally bright. These are Dr. Henry
Meyer, who has been Identified with local
> politics for years and was at on* time
'- chairman of the. Republican County Com
mittee; Dr. R. W. Payne, a relative of
John I. Sabin of the telephone company;
: I>r. Winslow Anderson, who has long been
afflict d with an ambition to held office.
i and 1 'r. W. I. Terry, whose residence is
a.t the Occidental Hotel.
Politicians who are roughly convers
tint with the situation will readily under-
Ftand that these gentlemen need have no
great cause for anxiety over the outcome.
But the appointment of Drs. Barbat, ( ' if.
fey and Keenoy is settled and there need
be no further discussion around the hotel
corridors as to their chance's.
CALL IT A GOLD BRICK.
Governor Gag-e's Proposition So
Dubbed by the Labor Council.
The Pan Francisco Labor Council at
Its mooting last night unanimously adopt
ed the following resolution, which was
presented by Delegate P. H. McCarthy:
Wherpap, It has came to the notice of the
Labor Council that gambling rlens have been
opÂ»nly conducted in the most popular districts
of the city, an.l that the same have existed
without any apparent molestation by the po
lice; and
\Vherp;is. A movement has been inaugurated
by the respectable element of our city to sup
press th<Â» evil; therefore, be It
Resolved. Hy the S.in Francisco Labor Coun
cil in meeting aspomblpd this 28th day of April,
thnt we protest against the continuanct of
these fumbling games, and we earnestly call
upon thf- Police <"oinmissi')ners to take an ac
tive Interest In the suppression of these per
nicious oorruj'ters of our youth, and further
urge that the Chip' of Police he rerjupsted to
continue the crusade until the gamble are
forced to quit their evil traffic, co that this
diefracp be eliminated from our shopping <iis
trlcts.
Having disposed of the gambling evil
the Council n<xt paid its attention to Gov
ernor Gage for his action regarding the
appointment of a Labor Commissioner. It
â wan stated that the Governor desired to
have the Council submit five names to
him from which he might select a Com
missioner. This was characterized ad
giving the labor element a. gold brick. It
was only a big bluff from which he could
decline to appoint any one of the names
submitted to him and which would give
him an opportunity to appoint some
heeler from the southern portion of the
State.
The Council Indignantly declined to
furnish him with any names other than
the one already sent in. He has the ad
dress of the secretary, and can communi
cate with him as he lid when he was a
candidate last year and at the time he
was looking for the labor vote.
After a lengthy discussion over the boy
cott against Siebe & Green's bill posting
concern, it was finally decided to let the
boycott stand until such time as the firm
make concessions with the union bill
posters.
The following delegates were appointed
on Labor day: W. J. Macarthur, A. Dijeu,
Ernst Keolng D Doggett, M. Monahan.
Fred Wescott, P. .1. Deitz, and by request
of the Council Secretary Ed Rosenberg
was added.

THE NEW STATE
NORMAL SCHOOL
AWAKES TO LIFE
Governor Gage Names
Trustees.
HUSTLING TO BE PRINCIPAL
THE CITY'S INSTITUTION" WILL
BE DIFFERENT.
Judge M. Cooney a Trustee â A High
Standard, a Two Years'
Course and Bright
Future.
The new State Normal School at San
Francisco, which the Legislature created |
and provided with $20,000 for two years, j
will be an entity In a day or two, when |
Its five trustees who have been appointed j
by Governor Gage are publicly announced, j
This new institution will start out in a !
small way, but it will mean much to the
educational interests of the State and |
city and promises to soon rise to great '
importance.
The appointement of the trustees and j
the organization that must be completed !
within sixty days have been the subjects
of much quiet work, worry and specula
tion In some quarters. It is known that
Judge M. Cooney, who is mainly respon
sible for the success in establishing the
school, Is one of the trustees named. Sev
eral well known gentlemen have sought
the honor. Though the appointments are
made the public announcement awaits
the Governor's pleasure.
There are three leading candidates for
the office of principal, or rather "presi
dent," as the heads of the State normal i
schools are now officially termed. Laura j
D. Fowler, who has bo long been principal
cf the city normal school, which the State
Institution supplants, would like the place
and may get it. Madison Babcock and \V
D. Kingsbury of the San Francisco
School department are hot after the
plum.
Within the limits of the general laws
regulating State normal schools the Board I
of Trustees, of which the Governor and !
Superintendent of Public Instruction are
ex-offlcio members, has quite absolute au
thority in organizing and running the
school. They may fix the length of the
course, the entrance requirements, etc.,
about as they please, regulate the number
of teachers, the salaries and so on.
It is known that what is to be done has
been pretty certainly outlined. The trus- |
tees, with their $10,000 a year, will try to
take up the city institution when it 'will
be abandoned at the end of this school
year, enlarge and improve it somewhat
and begin an evolution toward a great
institution. The Board of Education will
be asked to turn over the present prem
ises and equipment, and if it does so the i
new State Normal School will be opened |
in the old quarters on Powell street, near
Sacramento. The present Normal School,
which is yet a municipal institution,
though the expenses are paid by the
students, has 125 pupils and two teachers. I
Probably the new school will open with
two teachers. Improvements will be made
and much equipment added. If other
quarters must be had they will be rented
somewhere.
It is understood that the new quarters
will differ quite radically from the other
State normal schools at San Jose ChiCO,
Los Angeles and San Diego. It will. if the
ideas of Mr. Cooney and others are fol
lowed, as they probably will be. At the
other State normal schools the course is
four years and grammar school graduates
are admitted. The first two years are
devoted to scientific and literary studies,
so that they are practically high schools.
Pedagogy figures in the last two years.
Judge Cooney believed that the institu
tion should be purely a normal school
devoted to the training of teachers. It is
proposed to make the standard of admis
sion a graduation from a high school or
its equivalent. School studies will be sim
ply reviewed and pedagogy and practical
experience in teaching will be the main
features of the course. With the high
Ftandard for admission th.> course will
be made two years only. It Is expected
that students may spend half their time
in the city school rooms, getting practical
experience. It is proposed to turn out
teachers only and a high grade of them.
The City Normal School has been prac
tically a State one. for a large percentage
of its students have gathered from vari
ous'counties In the otate and with its
one year's course its diplomas have been
recognized in over thirty counties. It is
expected that the high standard to be
adopted and the advantages of the city,
Including its schools, will draw a large
attendance from all over the State.
In looking ahead its sponsors see a suc
cess that in two years will bring about
the building of a big edifice, an attend
ance of hundreds and adequate appropria
tions.
It was all the quick result of the clos
ing of the City Normal School by the
retrenching new board and a mustering
of its friends for State support.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, APRIL 29, 1899.
TOWN AND PEOPLE READY
TO HONOR DEWEY DAY
The Flag That Floated Over Dewey Will Be
Spread to the Breeze in Golden Gate Park.
T"*IREPARATIONS for the celebration of Dewey day on Monday are com-
PREPARATIONS sunrise till sunset the name and deeds of the hero of
plete, and from sunrise till sunset the name and deeds or the hero of
J[ Manila will be sung and honored throughout the city. i
In the celebration at Sunset Park by the Sons of "Vermont two men
who fought with the gallant admiralâ Carpenter O. H. Hilton of the Boston
and Gunner J. C Evans,' who were with Dewey on that history-making May
dayâ are expected to take part.
Judge Edward A. Belcher, president of the celebration committee, has
addressed the following letter to C. R. Ransom at Mare Island Navy-yard,
and It is expected his request "will be granted:
â  "*"C. R. RANSOM, Vallejo. Pal.â Sir: We shall be glad to have Carpenter O. H.
Hilton, sometime of the Boston, and Gunner J. C. Evans, sometime ofythe Boston,
both at the battle of Manila Bay, participate in the celebration of Dewey Day at Sun
pet Park. Will you please request them to report to me at the foot of Market street,
narrow gauge ferry, this city, on the morning of May 1, "Dewey Day," at about 8:30,
and I will furnish them transportation from San Francisco to the park and return to
this city, and invite them to a place on the stage during the ceremonies. Very sin
cerely yours. . â¢ EDWARD A. BELCHER, President.
The beautiful American flag presented to the Park Commissioners by the
sailors from the United States ship Raleigh will be thrown to the. breeze on
Monday. This flag has only been used once, and then in compliment to the
men who brought it here from Manila. It is singularly appropriate to dis
play it on Dewey day, coming as it did from the men who fought under
Admiral Dewey on that memorable Ist of May a year ago. It will be dis
played near the music stand. A special programme ft appropriate music will
be rendered by the Park Band -during the afternoon.
The day will be duly observed on the -water front. All the State offices
will be closed, and the wharfingers, collectors, carpenters and sweepers will be
given a holiday. Almost every ship in port will be decorated with bunting,
and the battleship lowa will fire an Admiral's salute.
The American ship captains are going to make it a point to have their
ships decorated, and as very few of them have crews aboard, the captains
are going to sen to It themselves that the bunting is spread. The British
ship captains propose to follow suit, and as every steamer, ferry-boat, yacht
and river steamer will be flying her colors, the bay should present a strik
ing appearance.
Some pleasant correspondence has passed between President Edward A.
Belcher of the celebration committee. Major General Shafter and Captain
Henry Glass, commandant of Naval Training Station. Ye.rba Buena Island,
regarding the firing of salutes on Monday. It has finally been arranged that
a salute of seventeen guns will be fired from the United States ship Pensa
cola at 8 a. m. on Monday. At noon the land batteries will belch forth their
salute of seventeen guns in honor of the occasion.
The employes of the California Northwestern Railroad Company will pic
nic at Mirabel Park on Dewey day.
The Central Methodist Episcopal Sunday-school, Mission street, between
Sixth and Seventh, will celebrate Dewey day by special exercises at the regu
lar Sunday-school session, 12:45 o'clock to-morrow. Special music has been
prepared by the choir. A patriotic address will be delivered by Rev. George
"C. Adams, D. D., pastor of the First Congregational Church. There will be
other exercises suitable to the occasion. The public is invited to be present.
A social entertainment and ball will be given by the Point Lobos Improve
ment Club at Richmond Hall on Dewey day. The following is the pro
gramme of the evening exercises:
Remarks by the chairman, D. 1... Fitzgerald; overture, Instrumental duet, James
Vincent, Miss Ella Fletcher; song, "The Quaker" (Stephen Adams), George T. Balch;
club swinging. Miss Lottie J. Graeber; song. "Waiting" (Mlllard), Miss Alice Vincent;

gathering and picnic at Shell Mound Park, Berkeley. As Monday will be a
legal holiday a large crowd is expected. The affair Is in charge of the
young men of the parish. A band will leave on the 9 o'clock boat. The boat
will leave the foot of Market street every half hour. The games will start
at 1:30 p. m.
IS GRATIFIED AT
SMITH'S PROMOTION
MAJOR GENERAL ANDERSON
ARRIVES FROM MANILA.
Duboce Was Given Too Much Credit
in the Engagement of February
sâ Major Sime Is Praised.
Ma.inr General T. M. Anderson. V. P. V.,
who ia also brigadier general in the regu
lar arm) . arrived from Manila on the
America Maru yesterday and Is a guest at
the Palace. General Anderson received or
ders to come to San i^rancisco, and after
telegraphing his arrival to the depart
ment at Washington he will await fur
ther instructions here. It is more than
likely that he will be assigned to one of
the four departments now vacant. These
are the Departments of the Lakes, Gulf,
I'latt<* and Columbia.
General Anderson first came to this city
from Alaskn. whore he was colonel
of the Fourteenth Infantry, and he was
placed in charge of the first Philippine
expedition which left this port soon after
the outbreak of the war, and included
the First California Volunteers. In an in
terview regarding various topics last
evening. General Anderson said:
"I was very much gratified at the pro
motion of Colonel James F. Smith to bp
brigadier general. I consider that hf>
should have had it long before he did. It
should have come after the battle of Ma
nila, where Smith distinguished himsHf.
He has proven himself a good soldier and
a prudent and able adviser. He has been
intrusted with a number of important ne
gotiations, notably the reconstruction of
Negros, and has performed the.n nil with
excellent judgment. His promotion is a
deserved one.
"Regarding the Filipinos, I must say
that they are natural born fighters, with
a good deal of military spirit. All things
considered, they got up a very good or
ganization; but, fortunately, though they
had better arms than we had. they did ;
not know how to use them. They cannot
use artillery effectively either. In thÂ».
battle of February 5 I captured seven
runa fn>m themâtwo Krupp and five old
fashioned muzzle-loaders.
"Agulnaldo is shrewd and unscrupulous.
He has the sympathy of the people, but
lately he has been but a mere figure-head,
because the revolutionary junta, com
posed of a set of professional revolution
ists, has taken the matter in its own
hands. The Malolos crowd determined to
achieve independence if they could and
then divide up the church property, which
is very valuable, abrogating all the old
Spanish concessions and appropriate them
to their own use.
"General Whf-aton's flying column is
performing effective work against the in
surgents. The object of the present cam
paign is to drive them from a railroad
from Manila to the northern part of the
island and force them to the hills.
"I must say that the First California is
an excellent regiment. Major Sime has
also proved himself a capable soldier. He
is quiet and unobtrusive and thoroughly
posted in military affairs. An injustice
has been done both to him and Smith
in ascribing most of the credit of the
engagement of February 5 to Duboce.
While the latter did good work, his com
mand was not as important as that of
Smith or Sime. The little that Duboce
h;ul to do h*- did very well. He was held
back in command of the reserve. Most
of it was drawn away, leaving him in
command of two companies. An attack
w;is made on them by a lot of Filipinos
from the village near by. Duboce drove
them out, but he did not take part in thr>
more severe and decisive part of the bat
tk-; mind you. through no fault .of his
own. To mention him and not the others,
however, appears to me to be an unin
tentional injustice."
BLOCKADE IN CHINATOWN.
Police Have Inaugurated a New Sys
tem Which Stops Gambling
Games.
The police und<=T Lieutenant Esnla and
Sergeant Donovan have established what
i? practically a blockade of the gambling
club? in Chinatown, and as a result all
the doors are wide open and the rooms
where once crowds of Mongolians held
their breath watching the fall of a bean
are vacant. â¢
The blockade was actually begun a few
days ago, and it has now become thor
ough and effective. The squad men and
uniformed police are working on a rotary
system. Two men will visit a club; about
five minutes later two more men will drop
I in, while the other two are at the far end
of the alley, and so it goes on until each
! man has visited each club or suspicious
1 place. By the time the last pair has com
| pleted the rounds the first pair is back
[again, and It Is thus almost impossible
to carry on any Â£nmfÂ». Formerly it was
customary to make spasmodic raids.
either by trickery or force, but these only
stopped certain games temporarily. I'n
der the now system it Is impossible for
any games to run. If the police find a half
dozen men assembled in any of the rooms
they promptly kick them into the streets.
Of cnurpe, under this system very few
arrests are made; but the police are really
doing more work than if they were ar
resting fifty or a hundred men nightly.
with no evidence that gambling was being
carried on.
The best evidence of the efficacy of the
plan comes from the Chinese themselves,
who are loud in their denunciations of It.
One of the club managers says: "They
come into place one hundred times in two
days. If they find any man here hut our
working man they kick him out in the
street. I do no business. I might just
as well close up. for then I would not
have to buy any light."
MANY ARTICLES SOLD
IN CHARITY'S CAUSE
THE C. L. A. S.'S BAZAAR AGAIN
THRONGED.
Archbishop Riordan Unable to At
tend Through â Features
for This Evening.
Illness prevented Archbishop Riordan
from attending the bazaar of the Catholic
Ladies' Aid Society last night. His Grace
sent his regrets to the ladies who are in
charge of the affair and promised to be
on hand some time during the week.
As was expected there was a slight fall
ing off in the attendance last night. Dur-
Ing the evening a large number of visitors
thronged the fair and bought the pretty
and useful articles on exhibiton or tried
their luck in the games that are in
progress.
Knicknacks. needle work and other ar
ticles are rapidly sold, as the prices asked
are less than cost. It is expected that
even a larger crowd than that which was
present on the opening night will bo on
hand this evening. An entertaining pro
gramme has been arranged expressly for
the occasion. Many organizations have
signified their intention of visiting the
bazaar before its close as the great work
the Catholic Ladies' Aid Society has been
doing in the cause of charity has won
their recognition.
WILL ARGUE TO-NIGHT.
Debating League of Northern Califor
nia Will Discuss the Czar's
Universal Peace.
The second semi-annual convention of
the Debating League nf Northern Cali
fornia will convene in business session at
9 o'clock this morning in the Girls' High
School auditorium for the purpose of or
ganization. This afternoon the election
of officers -will take place, and to-night
there will be a debate between the Stock

judges are Superintendent Webster, T. O.
Crawford and Attorney Goodsell. The
convention of the league was prefaced last
night by an interesting programme of a
social nature that was given in the audi
torium of the High School, at which Presi

FULL EXTENT OF
WIDBER'S CRIME
IS YET UNKNOWN
Further Shortage Has
Been Discovered.
ABSENT HEIRS WERE ROBBED
HINT THAT OTHER OFFICIALS
MAY BE IMPLICATED.
The Known Additional Defalcation
Amounts to More Than $1200.
Some Questionable
Methods.
Treasurer Truman has discovered the
alarming fact that the full extent of ex-
Treasurer 'Widber's defalcation Is as yet
unknown. Enough is known to make it
certain that something more than $1200
must be added to the one hundred and
sixteen thousand odd dollars that Wid
ber admits having stolen from the vaults
of the city treasury and appropriated to
his own use. This additional sum be
longed to absent' heirs whose bequests
and legacies have from time to time been
deposited with the Treasurer by order of
court.
Facts connected with the discovery of
this additional defalcation are such as
to lead the officials to suspect that Wld
ber was not alone in his peculations, and
that some other person in authority un
der him was aware of the manner in
which the city was being robbed and may
even have been a party to the robbery. At
present the officials refuse to discuss this
phase of the case, but hints are thrown
out that future developments may serve
to implicate others than Widber In at
least a part of the defalcation.
The discovery also leads to the conclu
sion that the investigation of the books
and accounts of the Treasurer which was
made after Widber's defalcation became
known was not sufficiently thorough to in
sure the discovery of the entire amount
of the disgraced official's peculations.
How it came about that the "absent
heirs" account was overlooked by these
investigators and police officials is a prob
lem, the solution of which may throw
some additional light on the hints of com
plicity that are now being indulged in.
The present discovery was made
through the demand of the heirs of the
estate of Margaret Sullivan, deceased, for
the sum of $643 TO, deposited with the
Treasurer in 1896 by the administratrix
of the estate. When the demand was
made it was found that there was ncr
money in the treasury to the. credit of
these heirs, although the heirs produced
a receipt signed by Treasurer Widber ac
knowledging the receipt of the money.
A search among the papers found in
Widber's safe after his arrest brought to
light an order of court to the effect that
the money belonging to these particular
heirs be deposited with the Treasurer,
and also a copy of the receipt now held
by the heirs. This copy Is in the hand
writing of Louis Jacobs, who was one of
Widber's deputies. The receipt reads as
follows:
â¢V. â¢'-: SAN FRANCISCO. August 7, 1896.
Received from Julia Conroy, administratrix
of the estate of Margaret Sullivan, â  deceased,
six hundred and forty-three and 70-100 dollars
($643 70), said money being shares of said es
tate of Phillip Harrington and Daniel Harring
ton, whose whereabouts Is unknown.
Share of Daniel Harrington $321 85
Share of I'hillip Harrington .'.. 321 85
Total 1643 70
Phillip and Daniel Harrington now ap
pear on the scene, with their attorney,
J. F. Riley, and demand their patrimony
at the hands of the Treasurer. As there
is no money in the "absent heirs' " fund,
except such as has come in since the ar
rest of Widber, the Messrs. Harrington
will be forced to sue the city for the
money due them.
Strange as it may seem, "Widber kept
no book account of money paid him on
account of absent heirs. The only evi
dence that can be found in the Treas
urer's office to show that he ever re
ceived any moneys on this account are
some papers â orders of court and copies
of receipts similar to those in the case
of the Harrington heirsâ which were
found in the safe in his private office.
An examination of these papers and the
records, in the office of the County Clerk
show that there was paid to him on ac
count of absent heirs various sums as
follows:
Estate of Eliza Choll $295 70
Estate of Edward Browne ISO 86
Estate of Maria Newman 1 00
Estate of Stanhope Dickinson 100 00
Estate of Margaret Sullivan 643 70
Total U. 221 26
Not a cent of this money was found in
the treasury after Widber's arrest, and
the fact that it should have been there
seems to have been overlooked by those
who had charge of the investigation that
followed. Should the heirs to these es
tates come forward and demand the
money due them they would find nothing
to satisfy their claims.
It ie not known whether or not other
moneys were deposited with Widber to
this account, all that is now apparent be
ing the fact that he received the sums
named. A long and tedious search of the
probate records in the Counts Clerk's of
floe, covering the period of Widber's in
cumbency, will be necessary before ' it
will be definitely known just how much
money was paid Into his office by order of
court on account of absent heirs.
Treasurer Truman has made another
discovery that will probably lead to the
disclosure of a still further shortage in i
the ex-Treasurer's accounts. It Is the
matter of escheated estates where small
sums of money are involved. Money
drawn from this source is paid to the
Treasurer and he is required by law to
remit the same to the State Treasurer.
It is asserted that in at least one in
stance, where the sum of $26 is Involved,
Widber's books show that the money was
paid by him to the State Treasurer, but
the books of thÂ« State official prove that
the money was not so paid. This account
and others of similar nature are being in
vestigated, and it will be several days be
fore the full facts are known.
WIDBER ASSUMES
ALL THE BLAME
SAN RAFAEL, April 28.â Widber was
interviewed at San Quentin Prison to
night in reference to the foregoing and
made the following statement: "Mr. de
la Montanya, so I understand, was the
man who went over my accounts with
Mayor Phelan immediately after the
shortage was* discovered, and made a
compilation tixing the actual and total
amount of the shortage. His total was
the aggregate of all the sources from
which money was missing, and he should
be in a position to know all about the
records and whether this $1200 has any
thing to do with the aggregate or not.
"1 presumed this grand total represent
ed all the discoveries of shortages, but
this item may have been overlooked. I
have not been near the office for a year,
and cannot tell whether this is another
itnm or not on account of the fact that
the aggregate was divided into shortages
referring to the various funds. The fart
of any particular clerk signing a receipt
does not necessarily imply that he was
responsible for the shortage. I do not
remember anything about this particular
item, but the responsibility fell upon me
at the time and rests upon me now, and
this new discovery, if it is a new one
would not help me any hy having the re
sponsibility thrown upon anybody else
This much I will say, however: The office
was open the morning after I left, and be
tween the time It was opened and the
time it was closed and sealed by Mayor
Phelan and Auditor Broderick there was
an excellent chance for any of the clerks
to abstract money from the vaults. Al
though this is true, I do not wish it to
be understood that T imply any of the
funds were tampered with during that
time. It is mentioned merely as a possi
bility and not as a fact."
Widber was very anxious to have all

Baseball To-Bay.
The tail-enders. Sacramento and Oak
land, will come together at Recreation
Park this afternoon for the first of a
series of three games that promise to be
frauÃh* with more than passing interest
to the baseball public. Both teams owe
their present unfortunate position to a
series of accidents, bvit they have made
special efforts for this series. Sacramento
has signed some new men, including Har
vey, the great left-hand pitcher, and is
trying to lure Truck Egan from San Jose.
The Oakland cripples, with the exception
of Dtmleavy, are again in good shape and
prepared to fight the baseball battle of
their lives. The teams are evenly
matched, and when in anything like their
normal condition are capable of putting
up as good ball as any team in the league.
