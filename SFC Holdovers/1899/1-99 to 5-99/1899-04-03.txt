MANILA, April 2. 6:30 p. m.â The
American troops under General Mac-
Arthur are still resting at Malolos,
r where everything has been auiet to
day. Hostilities elsewhere â so far as
officially reported â have been limited

occasional exchange of shots, between
the insurgents and troops forming the

BATTLE OF TURKS
AND BULGARIANS
VIENNA, April 2.â A serious collision has taken place between
Bulgarian and Turkish frontier guards at Kozyl-Agob, between
Jamboli, Eastern Romelia, and Adrianople, on the banks of
the Toonja, fifty-six miles south of Jamboli.
According to a dispatch from Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, the
Turks attacked a weak Bulgarian outpost, but the Bulgarians,
aided by armed inhabitants, repulsed their assailants after a
fierce fight. Both sides suffered losses of killed and wounded.
The Turks, the dispatch says, were seeking a position hith

Kozyl-Agob is the railway station nearest the Turkish fron
tier, in Bulgarian territory, and it would be an important stra
tegic point for the Turks if they desired to send troops into
Bulgaria.

HAWAIIANS CLAIM TO
HAVE HEARD THE SPIRIT
OF PRINCESS KAIULANI
AINAHUA, the Country Home of the Late Princess Kaiulanf, Where Spiritual Manifesta
tions Are Said to Have Been Heard Since Her Death. The Cross Marks the Room
Occupied by the Princess.
H HONOLULU, March 25.â 1t is a
habit among the natives of the
Hawaiian [glands that for nine
days after the death of a chief
or chiefess their thoughts must
he of the dead. During these days
they relate the mysterious happenings
that always seem to come to pass after
one of royal blood has departed this
life. Tt is with an idea of giving to
the world some of the uncanny happen
ings after the death of the late Princess
Katulanl that this article is written.
It was midnight on the 10th of
March. I^9o, that a solemn procession
passed under the palms and spreading
trees of Ainahau and wended its wav
slowly toward the Waikiki road to
town, and then into the large gateway
Of Kawaiahao. Ii was the hearse hear
ing the body of the Princess Kaiulani.
followed by the mourning father and
others. Kaiulani had left her beauti
ful home for the last time and her body
was placed on a catafalque in Kawaia
hao church, thereto lie in state through
the next day.
Miss Robertson (left behind at Aina
hau on account of illness), together
with a number of native and Japanese
servants, were the only ones remaining
in the house after the departure of the
body for the church. This young lady
had just taken a reclining position on
one of the "hikieis" or divans that are
to be found all over the. house,
when, it is asserted, she heard
nofsefl that made her blood run
cold. Transfixed to the spot, she
listened for their recurrence, and in a
very short time they were repeated.
The room on the upper floor that bad
been occupied by the Princess seemed
to be in an awful state of unrest. The
pound of a myriad of bodies passing
through the room and tossing furni
ture about, it is said was
what met the ears of the
frightened people. Then came a
rush of wind. The door of the room
leading out into the hall opened with a
burst and something came down the
stairs with a rumbling sound. Then
the door leading to the walk that at i
nects the main house with the lanai
opened in the same mysterious way
and closed again with a slam. The
chairs and tables on the walk were
overturned, and a voice which was, ac
cording to the people in the house, un
mistakably that of the dead Princess,
was heard to cry, "Kauka! Kauka!"
quaint themselves with the topog
raphy of the country ir the vicinity of
Mariquina, which will be of value in
case the insurgents should give battle
to American troops at that point.
The fact that General Otis has not
cabled to the War Department to-day
has convinced the officials that the sit
(meaning "Doctor, doctor!*')
< >f e-ourse, this may all be the im
aginings of excited minds, hut it. is nev
ertheless a strange fact that nearly a
dozen people should tell almost the
same story. The noises may have been
caused by the strong wind blowing thai
night. However, the story, when heard
by the natives, was believed, and they
gave to it all a meaning.
It is a well-known fact that the
Princess hated the idea of dying. and
held to the hope that she would recov
er, even to the very last moment.
When she was dying and her father
stood at the bedside, his hand clasping
the wasted one held out to him. she
still fought for her life. Kaiulani had
the greatest faith in her physicians.
and trusted (o them to nurse her back
to health, btit the rheumatism finally
attacked her; heart and her fate was
sealed. The natives say that the voice
heard at midnight was truly that of
the Princossi protesting against her
death and calling upon her doctor for
aid.
Another peculiar happening was at
Washington Place, the town home of
ex-Queen Liliuokalani, which has not
been occupied since the Queen left for
the States. On tho night of the death
of the Princess Joe Heleluhe. who went
to Washington as the secretary of the
Queen while she was' fighting against
annexation, walked into the yard with
the intention of speaking with some
natives living it) the rear. He noticed
a lamp in the room on the upper floor
that used to be occupied by the Princess
when she was staying in town for a
few days. Thinking this unusual, he
went closer to the house and,
he declares, saw a figure stand-
Ing near the lamp, evident
ly in deep contemplation. When it
turned ho saw distinctly the face of
the dead Kaiulani. Then the light went
out and nothing more was to be seen.
The last and perhaps the strangest
of all the happenings in connection
with the death of the dead girl, wit
nessed as it was by hundreds of peo
ple, was at the gate to the graveyard
in Nuuanu Cemetery at the time when
the hearse bearing the body of the
Princess entered. The first carriage
was that of the father. Governor Cleg
horn, accompanied by Mrs. J. W. Rob
ertson and Mrs. J. H. Boyd, daughters
by his first wife. The father's dace
next to the body was undisputed, but
uation is quiet, and that he is merely
continuing his preparations for an act
ive campaign.
The authorities know that the ap
proach of the rainy season makes it
imperative that the American troops
should promptly gain a victory, as in
the rainy season it will be impossible
the two wnnifn mentioned had no rieht
in that position. The natives were very
much Incensed that they, being devoid
of even a drop of royal blood in their
veins, should be placed ahead of the
Queen Dowager's carriage and that of
the two Princes. David Kawananakoa
and Cupid Kalanianaole.
All the way to the cemetery, it is
said, the horses acted queerly, and
two or three times the driver
was forced to call for assist
ance from people In the proces
sion. As tho carriage was about to en
ter the cemetery pate the horses began
to back away and refused absolutely to
enter. The occupants became very
much frightened, but remained in their
places, thinking that the horses would
soon be gut under control. In this
they were mistaken. It was not Ions:
before a well-known Hawaiian stepped
to the side of the carriage and susrsrest
ed that the occupants alight and walk
to the mausoleum. They took heed of
the advice and got out. The horses im
mediately became quiet. Then the car
riage of the Queen Dowager. Kapio
lani, drove up and went Into the ceme
tery without mishap. Mrs. Robertson
and Mrs. Boyd were forced to enter
later on. The natives say that had the
two women persisted in remaining in
the carriage some terrible accident
would have happened to them. They
had said previously they would never
enter the gate ahead of the people of
royal blood. Many who stood around
while this thing took place say that the
head of the nigh horse was held to
ward the right hand kahili of state on
the catafalque, and that the head of
the off horse was held toward the left
hand kahili, indicating, as the natives
say, the cause of their stuhbornness.
Of course, to many these tales seem
to be the merest nonsense. Not so to
the native Hawaiians, who believe in
omens and who see in very many of
the happenings that pass by the ma
jority of people unnoticed some direc
tion from the spirit world. They are
as a race very superstitious, a fact that
can be readily proved by a glance at
the books written about them in the
olden times, and yet it is a remarkable
fact that a great many of. their pre
dictions, brought forth by various hap
penings, really do come true, and that
white people who have lived in the isl
ands for many years come to look for
the same signs as the natives-
MILITIA TO
GO IN QUEST
OF MOORE
WILLIAM H- K'LROY, the Brave Policeroan Murdered
by Ed Moore, Whom h\e Endeavored to fJrrest
at Nevada City.
Company C of Nevada City
Will Search for the
Murderer.
NEVADA CITY, April 2.â The
officers of the law are closi
the trade of Edward M â 
and before another day shall
have passed they expect to take
him into custody. Hemmed in by
rugged mountains, with the roads to
the lower country carefully guarded
by the authorities, the fugitive has lit
tle chance of escape.
For the first time since the murder
of Officer Kilroy definite Information
regarding Moore's whereabouts has
been received. At dusk last night he
was seen about two miles from Grass
Valley, near the North star mine, by
William Taunt. Taunt is a rancher
and has the reputation in GraK
ley of being a truthful man. Taunt
said positively to The ''all correspond
ent to-day that he had not only seen
Moore, but had held a lengthy con
versation with him.
"I could not be mistaken," said
Taunt. He and I were in the County
jail together in March, 1896, 1 serving
for disturbing the peace and he for as
sault with a deadly weapon. We
recognized each other immediati ly
last evening and shook hands. He said
he was going o the lower country on a
little trip. He had a bundle of blan
kets atid looked travel-stained and
weary, but had no gun and I saw no
pistols on him. He seemed glad t
me, and there was nothing unusual
about his manner. After a pleasant
chat he started leisurely down the
road toward Autjurn."
This morning Taunt heard for the
first time about the killing of Kilroy
by Moore.
"T~><> you mean Ed Moore, the half
deaf prospector up at Nevada City,"
he asked his informant.
"Yes, was the answer.
Then he told of having seen tho fu
gitive last evening. Sheriff Getchell
was immediately notified by telephone
of Taunt's story. Officers immediately
started toward Placer County. Offi
cers at Colfax, Auburn and all other
down country points were notified of
the clew, and Placer County's Sheriff
began arranging a cordon of regular
and special deputies, so as to effect
ually dose every avenue of escape in
that direction.
Sheriff Getchell and his posse are
still searching the mountains for the
fugitive, and when they find him the
citizens here expect to receive details
of a battle.
Moore is known to be a dead shot,
and he will fight like a cornered rat.
It is certain he will offer resistance,
and, in that event, it is quite prob
able he will die like the rest of his
to continue operations on the same
scale as is possible in the dry season.
Upon the administration of a crush
ing defeat the American Philippine
Commission will be able to issue its
proclamation, from which the authori
ties expect great results.
Step? <ire being taken by General
Otis > suppress all future filibustering
expeditions which may be sent from
the coast of China to Luzon in the in
terest of insurgents. I understand
that the thirteen gunboats obtained by
General Otis are to be manned by offi
cers and men of the navy stationed
along the coast for the purpose of in
tercepting any filibustering expeditions
that may get by the naval vessels.

The Board of Supervisors of this
county has announced that it will pay
an extra $1000 for the outlaw, dead or
alive.
In addition to the Sheriff's nopse.
fifty members of Company <". National
Guard of California, under command of
R. \l. Walker, will march out into the
hills to-morrow to search the aban
doned mining shafts and canyons back
of Banner Mountain. This step has
s been deemed necessary by the authori
â >â¢ the n ason that the country in
which Moore is supposed to be hiding:
I is so thickly wooded and mountainous
thai the fugitive might hide there for
| months. The militia boys will go out
' fully armed and equipped, carrying
provisions enough to last several days.
The authorities have already com
menced preparations to land Moore
safely in jail in the event of his beiner
taken alive. They entertain grave fears
that Moore will lie subjected to vio
lence at the hands of a mob when
brought to town. If Moore had been
arrested to-night there ; j little doubt
that all the Sheriffs and deputies, from
here to Sacramento could not protect
him, so intense is the hatred of the cit
izens for the cowardly murderer.
"William Kilroy was an officer who
knew his duty, and because he had the.
nerve to perform it he died the d^ath
of a dog. When his epitaph is written
it will be: 'He was faithful to his duty.'
He was murdered because he repre
sented the honest and law-abiding peo
ple Of this city, and there is no man
not a hoodlum or a rogue who does not
mourn for him to-d_ y."
These were the words with which

tory of domestic uphappiness. She
that when she was but 14 years
-he was sold by her father to
Joseph Cantzeler for sixty acres of
land. It was a literal sale of flesh and
blood.
Cantzeler was many years her senior
and she abhorred him, but one day
her father and Cantzeler got her into
a room and compelled her to sign a
paper agreeing to marry him. For this
inhuman act her father received from
Cantzeler a deed to sixty acres of Yel
lowetone bottom land. Laws were
loosely enforced on the Yellowstone
in those days, and there was no one to
protect the helpless girl.-
For six troubled years she lived with
him, and they had three children. At
Q, in ISSft, his cruel treatment
I her to Bee tv friends for safety,
and she obtained a divorce at Helena,
being awarded the custody of her chil
dren. In July, I*9o, Cantzeler came to
her penniless and she fed him. He
hung around for several days and fre
quently took the eldest two children
out for a walk. One day he brought
them west to Seattle. Thither she fol
lowed hrm and made a fight in the
courts for their possession, but as she
was without funds the Judge ordered
them sent to the Orphans' Home.
Both Cantzeler and she married
again. She went to Butte to work, but
lately returned to Seattle to see her
children. She claims Cantzeler abused
them, compelling them to sleep on beds
of gunnysacks. Last week she
hrought her 13-year-old daughter to
Tacoma and intended to return later
for her son. For this faithful devotion
she is now under arrest.

THE SAN FKANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1899.
SUICIDE OF
REAR ADMIRAL
CARPENTER
Retired Naval Officer Shoots
Himself in the Head at
a Sanitarium.
HAD LONG SUFFERED
Was a Victim of Nervous Disorders
That Caused Him to Go Under
Medical Treatment.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOSTON, April 2.â Rear Admiral C.
C. Carpenter (retired) committed sui
cide yesterday in a sanitarium v
city. Admiral Carpenter was <
from the retired list to active duty i i
charge of the navy yard at Ports
mouth, N. H., during the war, while
Commodore Remey was on duty at
Key West.
Admiral Carpenter for the last six
weeks was an inmate of the Adams
Asylum, in the Jamaica Plain district,
and at the earnest request of his
family details have been withheld
from the public. He shot himself in
the head.
For a number of years previous to
his retirement Admiral Carpenter suf
fered severely from nervous disor
ders, and soon after being released
from service went under medical
treatment. He had apparently recov
ered, but six weeks ago there came a
relapse, and he was again placed in
the asylum. Again he seemed to im
prove, and the family had hope that
he would be himself again.
Charles C. Carpenter was born in
Greenfield, Mass., In 1884. He was ap
pointed midshipman from this State in
1650 and was attached to the sloop
Portsmouth of the Pacific squadron
from 1851 to 1855. He was in the Naval
Academy from lSi5 to Ibst> and was
promoted to passed midshipman in the
latter year. Later he served on the
steam frigates Merrimac, Roarmke,
Colorado and Dolphin. He was made
a lieutenant in ISSS and attached i <
the steamship Mohawk, which captured
the slaver "Wildfire off the coast of
Cuba, with 500 slaves on board. Car
penter was transferred in 1562 to the
steamship Flag of the South Atlantic
squadron and was soon promoted to
lieutenant commander. He next saw
service on the monitor Catskill of the
South Atlantic blockading fleet, and
was on board during the operations and
attacks upon the defenses of Charles
ton in 1563. After the dose of the war
he went to the Asiatic staticm with thu
sloop Hartford.
His first command was the steamship
Wyoming, on the same squadron, serv r
Ing on her for one year and then re
turning to this country. For two years
he was stationed at the Portsmouth
navy yard, during which time lie was
commander. Sea duty alternated with
duty at Portsmouth for the ten years
following. In 1883 he was commander
of the Hartford, which carried the
English and American eclipse expedi
tion in 1883 to the Caroline atol.
From 1888 to 18S0 he commanded the
ship Wabash at the Charleston navy
yard, finally being transferred to Ports
mouth as captain of the yard and later
as commandant. He received his com
mission as commodore in ISB3 and as
rear admiral a year later. As com
mander of the Asiatic squadron in 1894
he saw many of the naval movements
of the Chino- Japanese war.
Under his orders was fired the first
and only shot by an American man-of
war at a Chinese ship, thereby en
forcing the demands of this Govern
ment and averting the impe?iding
breach of relations between the United
States and China. His action was com
mended by our Government.
Admiral Carpenter was retired in
1896, but during the Spanish war was
recalled to act as commandant of th<.-
Portsmouth Navy Yard in place of
Commodore Remey.
Admiral Carpentr leaves a widow
and family, one son being assistant
surgeon in the navy, D. M. Carpenter,
who was on the Raleigh during the op
erations against Manila and who has
been transferred to the Olympia. An
other son is with the Cramps Ship
building Company and a third lives
with Mrs. Carpenter and her two
daughters at Portsmouth.
KILLS HIS SWEETHEART
AND COMMITS SUICIDE
"Lovers' Rock," a Romantic Spot in
Ontario, the Scene of a Double
Tragedy.
TOLEDO, Ohio, April 2.â A romantic
and tragic story comes from Point i
Ontario. James La Blanche, a young
French Canadian, killed his sweetheart,
an Indian girl, named Olga Postamio. The
Frenchman lived on the mainland and
had not seen the girl during the winter.
When he went to her home he learned
that she had given her love to another,
an American. He heggfd the young
woman to take a walk with him. When
they arrived at "Lovers' Hock," a spot
made famous because an Indian chief had
there murdered a French girl who refused
to marry him, La Blanche is said to have
stabbed Miss Postamie.
He threw the body into the lake and
then drove the knife with which he killed
the girl he loved into his own heart, fall
ing dead into the water after her.
POWDER CAR EXPLODES.
One Tramp Loses His Life and Two
Are Injured.
SEATTLE, April 2.â A Post-Intelll
gencer special from Everett, Wash.,
says: A powder car belonging to a
Great Northern freight train blew up
here this morning, killing one tramp
and injuring two others, who were rid
ing in an adjoining car. In addition to
the powder car two others containing
mixed freight were burned. The in
jured men gave their names as Sylves
ter Fagan and Charles Fkbotte. The
name of the dead man was unknown
to them. It is thought the car in which
the tramps were riding was set on fire
by them and the heat exploded the pow
der car.

FOUGHT FIRE
AND FILIPINOS
AT SAME TIME
How American Troops Sup
pressed Incendiaries in
Suburbs of Manila.
BRAVE NIGHT BATTLE
Fully Two Thousand Buildings De
stroyed Before the Flames Had
Finally Been Subdued.
Correspondence of the Associated Press.
MANILA, March I.â After many
false alarms and frustrated attempts,
the oft-repeated threats of the rebels
to burn Manila and massacre every
European and American within its
walls culminated in a disastrous con
flagration and an attempted uprising,
which was promptly checked, on the
night of Washington's birthday. That
preconcerted arrangements had been
made to fire the city in half a dozen
different places simultaneously there
can be no doubt, but fortunately the
plans miscarried, for various reasons,
and the natives themselves, or at least
their sympathizers lost as much, if
not more, than those upon whom they
sought to wreak their vengeance.
A quieter day than that of February 22
it would be difficult to imagine. All tha
banks and leading mercantile houses were
closed, and except for the fact that the
saloons were open it seemed more like
Sunday than a holiday, the excessive heat
and the condition of affairs outside having
kept most people indoors. About sun
down, however, the town bestirred itself,
and the streets were soon filled with peo
ple taking an airing before dinner, it
being the custom here to dine at 8 o'clock
and retire immediately afterward. Just
as the long strings of carriages which
daily pass and repass each other on the
Luneta were forming for the procession
homeward a dense black column of smoke i
rolled up above the intervening roofs, and
almost immediately afterward an ominous
r.-<l jdare was reflected from the sky.
Murmurs of horror were followed by
sharp orders to coachmen, and there was
a wild scramble for the city. Even when
this was reached and it was ascertained j
that the fire was in Santa Cruz district,
some distance from the residence section,
the alarm was not abated, for no one
doubted that incendiaries were at work j
and none knew where the next blaze
might bo started.
On the streets in the vicinity of the fire,
which was within two blocks of the Bs
. the wildest confusion reigned for
some time, people scurrying here, there
and everywhere. The blaze had started
in a row of two-story modern buildings
with brick foundations on the Calle La
coste, in the center of the Chinese sec
ti < ii, and as several of these had been
fired within a few minutes of each other
it soon assumed alarming proportions.
The local fire brigade turned out with
commendable promptitude, but with more
zeal than discretion proceeded to pour j
three tiny streams of water from as many
lines of hose upon the red-hot brick walls j
of the first building tired, which was al
ready doomed, instead of attempting to j
prevent those opposite and adjacent from
Igniting The consequence was that by
the time General Hughes and his men
arrived on the scene and commenced to
clear the streets the fire was spreading
on both sides of the Calle Lacoste and a
stiff breeze was fanning it forward.
During the excitement the hose was cut
five times and other impediments placed in
the way of the firemen. Upon learning
of this General Hughes issued orders to
his men to shoot the first man who inter
fered with the checking of the flames or
attempted to start others. Several natives
who picked up burning brands and darted
off with them were either shot or bay
oneted by the guards, and then a general
round-up of all natives on the streets
in the vicinity was ordered. As thousands
of people were vacating their houses
and carrying off their effects and the side
walks aiid roadways were littered with
furniture for blocks, this was a work of
some difficulty, but by degrees the sol
diers corraled hundreds of protesting na
and hustled them into yards and
vacant lots, where they were guarded
until the excitement subsided.
About 9 o'clock the European volunteer
fire brigade arrived on the scene with a
modern engine, and after three hours'
work the fire, was controlled. Meantime
the whole of the block in. which the
blaze originated, two-thirds of that on
the opposite side of the street, and a
block and a half west of it had been com
pletely gutted.
From a spectacular standpoint the fire
was a magnificent sight, the flames leap- |
ing from the wooden structures fifty feet
Into the air, while millions of sparks glis
tened among the rolling clouds of smoke
and fell in golden showers upon adjacent
roofs. Scores of fires were started by
these sparks to windward, but as every
one was alive to this danger they were
promptly quenched in their inclpiency.
Shortly after midnight, just as the
weary workers and watchers were repair
ing to their quarters, congratulating
themselves that the fire, bad though it
was, had been no worse, another blaze j
was reflected from the smoke-beclouded I
sky in the direction of Tondo. This being
the most densely populated native dis
trict in the city, which had always been !
identified with the rebel cause, prepara
tions were at once made for trouble, and
it 'was not long in coming.
No sooner had the fire brigade coupled i
its hose and commenced to play upon the
flames, which had again started in a block
of buildings occupied by Chinese, than
i shots were fired at the men from the j
! windows of tho adjacent houses. Com- :
i panics E and M, of the Second Oregon j
Volunteers, and M and C of the Thir
teenth Minnesota Volunteers, under Major j
Willis, were hastily reinforced by Major '
Goodale's battalion of the Twenty-third
Infantry, and an attempt was made to I
clean out the neighborhood. Suddenly, |
however, shots were fired from half "a I
dozen streets at once, and when this fusil- I
lade was followed by volleys from Maus- !
ers in the vicinity of the railway station.
ft was realized that the enemy had
sneaked around to the left flank of the
outposts at Caloocan, by way of the
creeks and estuaries of Vitas District, and
that there was other work than fighting
the fir.' to ho done.
As the strength of the enemy was un
known it was a ticklish situation to rope
with, but it had to be met and the Amer-
Icans, regulars and volunteers alike, met
It like men. A skirmish line fully a quar
ter of a mile lone was formed and ad
vanced under cover of huts and trees
until the rebels were discovered behind
hastily formed barricades of paving
stones and street car rails, commanding
two streets, and w-ithin two stone build
ing?. The firing from bushes and rhaeks I
became so hot that it was found i
sary to set fire to other shacks to wind- !
ward in order to smoke the rebels out,
and this having been done, an advance
was made upon the barricades. Both
were carried with a rush, but the rebels
made a determined stand within the
ruins of an old church, and it was not
until a detachment of the Oregon Volun
teers flanked them from an adjacent
brick building that they were moved
Thirty were shot within this inclosure
; and six more in another. Once the rebels
commenced to fall back it was easy to
: keep them moving, although they threw
i up barricades and hastily entrenched
themselves near the terminus or the
Malabon street railway.
This, however, occupied all of Thursday
morning, the rebels not being driven nut
of the city limits until long after d.-<v
liKht. While tluy left 113 dead on the
ground and several hundred were taken
1 prisoners, many escaped ir.to the swamp
i lands north of the city, thin side of Caloo
can, and are still believed to be in hid
; ing there. In order to guard against fur
; ther attacks of this nature the whole of
this section has been cleared, ail the na
ltives' shacks having been destroyed by
fire. The American loss was one private
of the Twenty-third Infantry killed, an
officer and three privates of the Minne
sota Volunteers and a private of the Or
egon Volunteers wounded.
While all of this was happening be
yond the scene of the fire the flames
rapidly consumed whole blocks of bam
boo structures, the popping of the explod
ing canes conveying the impression that
a regular battle was being fought. So
long as the fire wag confined to this class
of buildings no effort was made to sup
press It; but when it spread to other
streets lined with stone and brick build
ings a battalion of the Twenty-third Reg
iment relieved the native firemen and
fought the flames until noon, when they
were finally pubdued.
It Is impossible to estimate the amount
of damage done by these two fires, fully
2000 buildings being destroyed, together
with their contents.

PEKING, April L.-The Hongkong
authorities are pressing for an expansion
of territory ceded to Great Britain by the
treaties of Canton and Nanking, on the
ground that more land is needed for Gov
ernment buildings. They propose to build
a custom-house for the collection of Chl

AMERICANS ATTACKED
BY CUBAN BANDITS
Two Men Set Upon Near Holguin and
Bobbed of -Their Arms and
Horses.
SANTIAGO DE CUBA, April 2.-The
telegraph line to Havana, constructed by
the United States Signal Corps, is com
pleted and will be opened for commercial
messages to-morrow.
Five more bandits have been captured.
Including Nainon. a noted desperado. A
body of armed men a few days ago at
tacked two Americans in the neighbor
hood of Holguin, took their arms and
horses, and then wont still further north
tn rob the lighthouse at Gibara. Colonel
Gruble of the Second Immunes has gone
in pursuit. The trouble seems to have
grown out of the cessation of public
works in the province and the delay in the
approval of the estimates. Many who be
camo bandits during that period now re
fuse to return to work.

ODDITIES OF THE
CLEVELAND CAMPAIGN
Democratic Candidate Supported by Republicans
and a Republican Aided by
Democrats.
CLEVELAND, April 2.â More diversified elements have entered into
the munici ' campaign, which ends to-morrow, than is usual in political
contest?. There are two candidates. Democratic and Republican. The
Republican candidate is the present Mayor, Robert E. McKisson. who
has already been elected twice to office. The Democrat is John H. Far
ley, for many years Democratic boss of Northern Ohio, who was once
elected Mayor of Cleveland.
One of the peculiarities of the campaign is the fact that a Republi
can paper, the Cleveland Leader, is supporting the Democratic candi
date. Farloy, although he owns and operates two sa' xms, is warmly
supported by the Anti-Saloon League, and also numbers among his
aciive supporters the Christian Endeavor Union. The executive commit
tee of the Epworth League has also sent circular letters to members in
this city advising them to vote for Farlpy.
Party lines are entirely lost sight of. The fight is based on McKis
son's personality. He has the antagonism of Senator Hanna's friends
and adherents. Several ministers of the gospel have preached antl-Mc-
Kis~jn sermons, while on the other hand the Methodist. Ministers' Asso
ciation of the city has repudiated Farley and the Methodist Times which
published Farley's advertisement.
Another oddity of the campaign is the organization f about 300 phy
sicians of high stamV.ng in the city to work for Farley. One socially
prominent Jewish rabbi is making stump speeches for Parley, while an
other, recognized as the head of the orthodox Jews, has declared for Mc-
Xisson. Among the active lieutenants of the Democratic candidate are
Harry and James Garfield. sons of the late President, r.nd Webb C.
Hayes, son of the late Rutherford B. Hayes.
ELECTION ISSUES
IN OHIO CITIES
National Politics Will Be
Affected.
FIGHT AGAINST M'KINLEY
HIS FOES WORKING FOR CON
TROL OF THE STATE.
Robert McKisson, Whom Hanna De
feated for the Senate, a Candi
date for Mayor of
Cleveland.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CINCINNATI, Aril 2.â While the mu
nicipal elections in Ohio to-morrow are
for local offices, yet they have strong
bearings on State and National poli
tics, and also on factional interests in
both parties. The municipal machinery
will have great influence in the selec
tion of delegates to the State conven
tions, to be held next month or later,
and the candidates for the Gubernato
rial and other State nominations air
conducting aggressive canvasses now
in connection with the municipal elec
tions. The bearing on national politics
is seen in Senator Foraker's presence
and interest in the course of events.
Should a Republican Governor be elect
ed next November who is unfriendly to
the senior Ohio Senator, that Governor
would no doubt be at the head of the
State ticket for his second term two
years hence, when members of the
Legislature are elected to choose the
successor to Foraker. The friends of
the national administration want a sol
id Ohio delegation to the National Re
publican Convention a year hence.
The Republican candidate for Mayor
of Cleveland, the home of Senator Han
na is Robert MeKisson, who was the
fusion candidate befoi'e the Legislature
in January of last year for Senator
against Senator Hanna. It is said
throughout the State that McKisson is
running for a third term not for the
Mayoralty alone, but also for the pur
pose of having President McKinley,
Senator Hanna and others in the Ohio
State conventions this year and next
year and of controlling the four dele
gates from the Cleveland district, and.
if possible other Ohm delegates to the
national convention next year.
In other Ohio cities the factional
lines are less directly drawn. In To
ledo there are two Republicans running
for Mayor, while the Democrats have
but one candidate. In this city there
is no election for Mayor, but much in
terest is taken in the election of two
members of the Board of City Affairs
which controls the local municipal
patronage. The usual fight is being
waged by the Demorats and independ
ent Republicans against George B. Cox
as the Republican "boss."
MURDERS IN CHICAGO
AMONG WARD HEELERS
CHICAGO, April 2.â The order of the
Harrison campaign managers to their
heelers to resort to intimidation even to
the point of murder bore immediate fruit
to-day, and as a first result three men He
dead in their homes. Early this afternoon
Paul Lund, Democratic ward worker,
armed with a revolver and bad whisky,
went into a saloon at 104 Oak street and
became involved in an argument with
Arthur Lawson, a leader of the young
Swedish-Americans. Lawson. seeing
Lund was drunk and in no temper for
argument, started to leave the place, but
before reaching the door he was shot

and deliberate delay occurs preliminary to that amount being turned
over to the Cubans, the $3,000,000 may be withdrawn and no payment of

so except in cases where the course of the

Regarding the matters under consld

contending that the sum left was to
raise a loan for which the Assembly
I icked adequate authority. Furthermore.
1 pointed out that the soldiers could not
wait; that already they were too great a
burden upon the people of Cuba, and
that longer delay appeared to me to be
cruel.
The conference ended without accom

make myself understood by the Assembly,
and decided not to be mixed up in its
doings, but to await developments. A few
days later three men whom I did not
know visited me and said that several
million acres stood "dry to fair " against
a loan of many millions, but that the
matter was possible only with my co
operation. I answered that I could not
consider any proposition of the kind, and
regarded it as strange that any one
would be ready to lend money without a
guarantee. My visitors replied that the
City Council could arrange a guarantee.
Then a committee of the Ass- mbly ap
proached me, askng me t>> support t
sembly's efforts to obtain a loan. To this
I replied that Cuba could not make a

More than this, the evidence in criminal

EAGAN'S EXPERIMENT
Refrigerated and Canned Meat Sent

Secretary of War Alger.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, April 2.â The Washinx-
I ton correspondent of the Herald tele
! graphs: Summing up facts brought
out by the investigation of the beef
' court of inquiry, now nearing a close.
! the friends of Major General Miles be
lieve that he has established the lus
: tice of his allegations. They assert that
| he has proved:
First â That canned and refrigerated
j beef issued to troops were unfit for use.
Second â That they were issued as a
â  "pretense of experiment." because
: canned roast beef, which as a part of
! the army ration had long been obsolete.
I was revived during the Spanish war,
I but is no longer issued to troops. All
; the facts go to show that In the great
i civil war and in Indian campaigns beef
i was furnished to the army on the hoof.
; The army in Cuba is now supplied with
â  beef on the block.
Third â That chemical processes for
preserving beef were fully discussed

I show that refrigerated beef could be
: kept in the tropics only by means of a
preservative, and according to the
statements of Messrs. Sypher, Giddings
| and Simpson as to conversations with
; General '. .lagan, his only c::cuse for not
â  giving contracts for live cattle to Tex
an firms was that beef firms had pre
servatives for keeping beef seventy-two
hours which would be given a fair trial,
and if unsuccessful he would then
award contracts to Texans for supply
â  ing cattle on the hoof.
Fourth â That Commissary General
Eagan and SecretaryAlger were respon

MAY MEAN A SHORT

Receivership of the Kansas City,

to Acts of Unfriendly Stock
holders.
KANSAS CITY, April 2.â The receiver
ship for the Kansas City, Pittsburg and

last night by Judge Gibson of the Cir
cuit Court, will, according to the reports
of officials, interfere in no way with the
operation of the4""operty, and the reor

lor Borne time will, it is claimed, go for

of whom arc Kansas City men, are
friendly to the president of the road,
Arthur E. Stillwell, who has engineered
the property from its inception. The
act, they declare, is a friendly one, and
was made necessary to head off unfriend
ly Eastern stockholders, who contem
plated similar action.
The history of the Kansas City, Pitts
burg and Gulf Railroad and its joint en
terprises, the northern connecting lines
and the Port Arthur ship canal, contains
practically a realization of the long de
sired short line to Che gulf. The finishing
:â¢â  line was accomplished mainly
through the efforts of A. K. S till well, for
merly vice president and now president
of the road. The road grew out of tne
old Kansas City, Nevada and Fort Smith
line, of Which E. L. Martin was presi
dent. The Nevada and Fort Smith lino
was projected to run to the gulf, but
only a comparatively short part of it was
finished when Mr. Btillwell picked up the
proposition.

BROADER TREATY
WITH CHINA MAY
SOON BE ADOPTED
President McKinley's Assur=
ances to Mongolians in
Hawaii.
BY DANIEL LOGAN.
HONOLULU. March 25.â From a
trustworthy source I have obtained
the substance of an interesting com
munication received by Chinese Consul
Pin from the Chinese Minister in
"Washington. It describes an audience
had with President McKinley by the
Minister.
President McKinley assured the Min
ister of his sympathy for the Chinese,
who had been put to great Inconve
nience, and in some cases hardships,
through the strict enforcement of the
instructions of the Treasury Depart
ment to its inspector sent to Honolulu
to supervise immigration matters un
der the Newlands resolution.
Furthermore, the President said that
he had expressed to the Treasury De
partment his desire that the Chinese
coming and going between the Hawaii
an Islands and their native country be
treated with the utmost courtesy and
consideration. The provisions of the
treaty with China should, in their case,
be interpreted with the greatest liber
ality.
The Minister was also informed that
there was a prospect, in view of the
changed relations between the United
States and the far East in consequence
of the American acquisition of the
Philippine Islands, of a broader treaty
of amity and commerce with China at
a not distant period.
President McKinley expressed his
high appreciation of the manner in
which the Minister had brought the
case of his aggrieved countrymen at
Honolulu to the attention of the ad
ministration. Nothing had been fur
ther from the President's thoughts than
that the application of the exclusion
laws to the Hawaiian Islands should
have been the occasion of annoyance
or injustice to any of the Minister's
countrymen.
President Dole's Cabinet still lacks a
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Public
Instruction. There are no foreign af
fairs that do not belong to Washington
to arrange. Hawaii has quite a lot of
public instruction, however, in its free
school system, which is messing up se
riously every day that the department
is without a head.
Attorney General Cooper was asked
as to the rumor to the effect that the
Cabinet trouble was owing to the in
tention of Mr. Dole to retire from the
Presidency. He answered that there
was nothing in the report.
The unheralded arrival of a freight
steamer from Tacoma yesterday, it is
said on good authority, may prove to
be the starting of a second line between
Puget Sound and island ports. On the
same day came the news that the Brit
ish-American Line with headquarters
at Seattle, has a small auxiliary boat

DYING IN SQUALOR.
John Sheehan, Aged and Paralytic,
Left by the Police to Perish.
John Sheehan is adding day by day to
hi; already groat burden of 70 years in
the most wretched poverty. In a little
hovel in Butchortown. on Fourth avenut,
between M and N streets, palsied ana
purblind, in an atmosphere made pesti
lential by ever heaping squalor, he Is
merely existing on the charity of neigh
bors, awaiting the day when the deliver
an< !' of death shall come.
The condition of the old man is most
pitiable. He i.s unable to procure or pre
pare; food for himself, he has no relatives
and is entirely dependent on the mertest
charity for the little food he manages t"
eat. Three times has the attention of
the police been called to his condition,
aril three times have they failed to nid
hint. They say each time that nothing
can be done to better his condition and
tha'_ he is "all right." Now and then
neighbors, almost as poor, if not as de
ciei it as himself, take food to the old
man, but that meagor charity will soon
end. as his humble benefactors say they
can 10 longer assist him.
LAID ALL BROOMS ASIDE.
Janitors Out for an Airing and an
Organization.
The dust lay thick on office, floors and
tiled hallways yesterday, for the janitors
were all off on a holiday, and such things
as a broom or dust brush were not to be
considered.

There are murmurlngs at the pros
pect of having a garrison of colored

deprecated by native Hawaiians. who

STRICKEN BY PARALYSIS.
Master of the British Bark Inver-
mark Dangerously HI.
HONOLULU, March 26.â Captain Alex
ander G. Phillips of the British bark In
vennark was stricken wfth paralysis on
March 23. He had been ashore in the
afternoon and returned to the vessel
shortly before 5 o'clock. He was ap
parently in the best of health, and dis
cussed matters concerning the ship with
First Officer Smith. Then he sat down
at his desk and began to write and Mr.
Smith went out on deck. Four or five
minutes later the steward called to the
first officer that something was the mat
ter with' the captain. Hurrying to the
cabin Mr. Smith found the captain lying
on the floor, where he had fallen from his
chair, his entire right side paralyzed. He
was conscious, but unable to speak.
The patient lapsed into unconsciousness
and has remained in that condition ever
since. The physicians, however, have
strmiK hopes of his recovery, as he is a
man of strong constitution and is a com
paratively young man.
Captain Phillips is 44 years of age, and
has followed the sea since he was 13. He
has bf-cn master of a vessel for fli'teen
or twenty years. His home is in Aber
deen, Scotland, where he has a wife and
four children.
The Jnvermark is due to sail hence in
about a week for Taltal, Chile, to load
saltpeter.

lowed the day to go by in peace and idle
ness.
The idea was to form a brotherhoodâ
a. brotherhood of janitorsâ an organiza
tion which was to include every man who
could swing a broom for more than ten
minutes at a stretch or was willing to
Bcrub windows above a second-story al
titude. There were janitors enough to
form a political convention before i-.e
day was very old, but they preferred to
spend their time in the dancing pavilion
with the Janitresses to spending it in ses
sion of organization: and so the day went
by with no brotherhood and no meeting
and nothing but a picnic, which, how
ever much of a success it might have
been, did but little toward forming a
league of janitors out for the dust and
sworn enemies of scattered waste paper
and grimy glass.
Then- was an attempt to hold a meet
ing toward tlie close of the festivities of
the day, but by that time most of the
available material for offices had depart
ed and the new organization was left in
its embryonic stage until there can be
another picnic or another holiday.
It Is intended to make the brotherhood
a purely social body. "It will have no
political significance" is the reply to any
questions touching its purpose.

Railroad Changes.
The new schedule of time on the San
Mateo line went into effect yesterday,
and all cars of the ferries branch ran.
direct to Glen Park, where transfers were
issued to the cemeteries line. Although
the service, according to the new regula
tions, was a great improvement, the re
opening of Glen Park yesterday brought
fully 8000 people to the popular resort and
taxed the carrying capacities of the rail
road to Its full extent.
It was thought some three weeks ago
that the Mission-street line would op
erate its enrs over the San Mateo Elec
tric Company's track from the intersec
tion of Twenty-ninth street, but this
agreement seems to have fallen through,
resulting in the difficulty of the San
Mateo road to handle the great crowds
which visited Glen Park yesterday.
To celebrate the reopening of the park
an exceptionally fine musical and vaude
ville programme hnd been arranged. The
Tivnli Theater orchestra rendered some
choice musical selections and the vaude
ville programme was select and interest

BEATEN BEFORE A
SHOT WAS FIRED
Mistakes of Cervera at
Santiago.
OBSERVATION OF A GERMAN
SPANIARDS HALF-HEARTED IN
THE FIGHT.
Commander Jacobson of the Imperial
Cruiser Geir Says Dread Was
Opposed by Calm
Assurance.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 2.â The bu
reau of naval intelligent of the Navy-
Department has issued the last of the
series of sketches of the Spanish-
American war by Commander Jacob
son of the German protected cruiser
Gelr. It deals with the condition of the
Spanish ships after the battle of San
tiago. This portion of the sketch con
tains a n-mber of otservations regard
ing the technical effect of our gun fire
which will interest naval officers. The
most interesting observations are those
upon the strategy, or lack of it. dis
played by Cervera. The Spanish ad
miral having been ordered to leave the
harbor to remove the main object of
attack upon Santiago, Commander Ja
cobson says his position was most dif
ficult. He did not dare make an at
tempt at night, and so decided to go
out in broad daylight.
'The whole crew," says, "fell a
victim to this fatal decision. Instruc
tions for the sortie and the western
course were issued. The admiral was
entirely convinced of the impossibility
of defeating the enemy or of reaching
another Cuban harbor, even if he
should succeed in steaming right
through the hostile fleet. It is to this
feeling of helplessnops and impotence
as against ttte American naval forces,
more than to anything else, that I am
able to define that the disaster was
due. The Spanish ships had spent a
month and a half in the harbor with
out even attempting to attack the
blockading fleet when a favorable op
portunity presented itself, or even
harassing it. The two torpedo boat de
stroyers were not used for the purpose
for which they were intended. This in
activity and lack of initiative must
have had a very demoralizing effect on
the officers and men. If we add to this
the certain knowledge that the opposing
forces were muc" stronger, it will
be readily understood that the idea
of general flight after coming out of
the harbor entrance was the only ac
ceptable one, especially in view of the
possibility of beaching the ships, there
by rendering them unserviceable and
eventually rescuing the crew.
"From the very moment that this
feeling of impotency took possession of
the Spanish and led to these reflections,
their fate, psychologically speaking.
was sealed. We do not mean to dis
parage their tenacity in the midst of
hostile fire, but, on the other hand, it
is quite natural that the admiral, see
ing that everything was happening as
he had foreseen, was the one who set
the. example of running his ship ashore.
All the other commanders followed this
example.
"On the American side the situation
was just the reverse. Admiral Samp
son's fleet was fully conscious of its
power. The blockade was being con-'
ducted in accordance with carefully
prepared plans, as were also the ar
rangements in case of the enemy's at
tempt to escape. Frequent engage
ments with the Spanish forts had given
the commanders and crews that calm
assurance in the handling of their
weapons which guarantees success.
The long Uockade service, exhausting
and monotonous, hardly interrupted by
any actn n on the part of the Spanish,
had strung the nerves up to the high
est pitch, and everybody was anxious
for the end to come.
"Suddenly the enemy attempts to es
cape. All the passions that had been
smoldering under the ashes break
forth. The welcome opportunity for
settling accounts with the enemy had
come at last, and w .1 a wild rush the
American ships fell on their victims."
SALE OF LIQUOR
AT ARMY POSTS
Meaning of the Law Not
Plain.
NEW YORK, April 2.â A Washington
special to the Herald says: Attorney
General Grlggs will render an ODinion
this week on the question of the
authority of the Secretary of War to
permit the sale of beer on public res
ervations under his control.
Temperance men throughout the
country, assisted by the whisky deal
ers, have been making a strong effort
to secure the prohibition of the sale of
beer at military posts and soldiers'
homes, and they succeeded in setting:
through Congress during the last ses
sion a provision in the army reorgani
zation law that "no officer or private
soldier shall be detailed to sell intoxi
cating drinks, as bartender or other
wise, in any post exchange or canteen,
nor shall any other person be required
or allowed to sell such liquors in any
encampment or fort, or any premises
used for military purposes by the
United States."
The Secretary of War is specifically
directed to issue such general orders aa
may be necessary to carry this provis
ion into effect.
Judge Advocate General Lieber held
that the section required total prohibi
tion of the sale of intoxicating liquors,
but Secretary Alger simply published
the law "for the information of all con
cerned."
Several officers commanding posts,
including that of Fort Monroe, closed
the exchanges on their reservations im
mediately upon the receipt of the law.
A question arose, however, as to
whether Congress really intended to
stop the sale of beer entirely on gov
ernment reservations. The Attorney
General will determine whether the
Government may authorize the sale of
liquor by permitting iV >c employment of
civilians out of the profits of the ex
change to dispense the beverage*.

TriE STATE OF BUSINESS.
\fHILE the business of the country, as repre
* sented by the bank clearings, was 68 per cent
* I l tveek than for the same week in
g in the march of im
as the increase over the previous week
per cent. There were also other indica
: in trade. The failing off is generally
attributed by the mercantile and financial element to
the extraordinary rush to combine all sorts of indus
â¢ which has attracted so much attention
of late. Ii " cause the trusts themselves are
feared, but the transition from individual to corporate
interests ied with more or less uncertain
ty. As one authority aptly puts it: "A period of
transi:: one ownership to another and from
ther, where it affects many
hundreds of establishments throughout the country,
inevitably causes some hesitation in business. A little
later the many hundred concerns may be doing more
b- intss than ever, as they were before the combina
. ore effected. But at the point of transition no
body knows just what to expect."

to anticipate the market, but this is transitory and one
of the r of commerce. The failures
for the first quarter of the year were the smallest for
seventeen year?, while the liabilities were the smallest
!->r twelve years. The failures during the first quarter
of 1899 have been in amount of liabilities not more
than about $26,680,330, against $31,710,142 last year,
$48,007,910 in Â£57,525,125 in 1896.
The staples show some new features. The boot and
shoe trade is halting, owing to the difference between
buyers and sellers. The talk of combinations has
softened wool quotations and affected the demand for
woolen goods. Iron and steel are still active, though
there is less snap observable in the business. There is
[ess call for drygoods in New York, and in fact the
me of textiles shows a falling off. but there is
encouragement in the willingness of buyers to place
liberal orders for fall delivery. Metals, whichi have
lately become weaker, show signs of returning
strength. Lumber continues firm, though the retail
demand is reported smaller.
-ible that we have been overtrading
during the past year. If this is so. there will be a pe
iparative inactivity, of course, until the de
mand sets in again. But it is hard to figure out an
inactive state of trade at the moment, when the bank
clearings, the accepted barometer of trade, are 68 per
cent larger than for the same week last year, and when
all the important cities of the country except Kansas
i New Orleans show a gain over 1808. Thus
us condition is presented. The merchants re
port 2 quieter business, while their own figures show
much larger returns. Surely, one or the other must
inc.
Another curious feature of the week was the ad
vance in Wail street in the face of an actual rise in the
rates for money. Call loans got as high as 12 per
cent, while a good deal of borrowing was done at 5@6
per cent. Nevertheless the market increased in ac
tivity and the sales were considerably over 1,00,000
shares for three consecutive days. A feature of the
improvement was the eagerness of the public to buy,
another proof of the vast sums available for invest
ment in the United States. There was a decline later
on in the week, but a firmer reaction followed. The
bull feeling i- very strong in Wall street just now,
and if there were any serious slackening in trade the
tendency would be iust the other way.
The local situation shows no change. Assured of
abundant crops, the State is at case as far as business
pnes. The season is now far advanced that we are
almost certain of a fine harvest, which will be enor
motlS if we are spared the infliction of drying north
wind? from now on. Even with a normal visitation
of this sort we shall have a satisfactory harvest. As it
is. the situation is infinitely hotter than at this time
last year.
One of the nr: in a recent event here has
; nr as Los Angeles on some of his hard-earned
money, and denies that he was engaged in a fake. This
is truly surprising. Of course the first thing a pugi
list does after the swindling of the public is to get up
on the housetop and proclaim that his business is the
fleecing of suckers.
The stranger who claims to have been robbed of a
fat wallet which was returned by the thief after a single
$100 bill had been extracted ought to have told a bet
ter story or kept still.

THE PARTITION OF SOMOO.
I.HJROM the present outlook it appears diplomatists
can discern for the Samoan problem no solution
other than that of dividing the islands among
the three powers, and putting an end to the experi
ment of a tripartite government. Germany has pro- i
posed it, our Government regards it with favor and it
is believed Great Britain will interpose no objection. |
The partition of the islands, however, is by no
means a desirable thing. The objections to it are so â¢!
strong that when the project was first broached it was
rejected almost without consideration. Each of the
three powers involved in the controversy obtained a â 
foothold for trade in the islands by assuring the na- j
I tives that no attempt would be made to subjugate
: them. Furthermore the powers by a solemn treaty :
! bound themselves to one another and to the islanders i
not only to respect the independence of the group but i
to guarantee it against assault from other powers.
The disturbances which led up to the conflict in
which an American marine and three British sailors !
were killed, and which brought about the bombard- ;
ment of the native villages by the American and the
I British war vessels, were not primarily due to the na
tives. That much is made clear by the "brief official i
dispatch of Rear Admiral Kautz which has just been
I made public. In the dispatch the rear admiral says:
"The Mataafa people obeyed orders to leave the
i Government reservations. Since then they have be
come aggressive, killing Private Holloway and three
British sailors. Our man killed was guarding the
1 American consulate. The German Consul General is- ;
| sued an incendiary proclamation saying that my proc-
I lamation was untrue and that he would uphold the j
' provisional government. The British forces act in â 
j concert with those of the United States, shelling reb- !
els wherever they can be reached."
On the record thus given it appears that the Ger
mans in the islands have become so dissatisfied with
their American and British rivals in business and col- ;
leagues in government that they have deliberately
provoked the recent outbreak for the purpose of forc
ing diplomatists to accept the partition policy as an
alternative to the danger of complications that may
d to war.
Doubtless the Germans have had some grievances
of which they have a just right to complain. They are
not likely to have acted so violently as they have done
without cause. Neither the Americans nor the British
are notable for a lack of aggressiveness in trade and
government, and in all probability they have at times
crowded their Teutonic cousins a little too far. Noth- !
I ing they could have done, however, would have justi
fied the Germans in taking the course they have :
adopted in refusing to obey the Supreme Court and in 'â 
â  issuing a proclamation denouncing as false the one
led by the American admiral.
To that extent the German representative at Samoa
! is clearly in the wrong, and if his Government would |
; repudiate his action it might yet be easy to restore
I order and harmony in tho islands without destroying ;
their unity as a country and dividing them among the j
wrangling powers. It appears, however, that the Ger
mans at home are too much wrought up over the is- j
; sue for any Minister to take the risk of such a repudia
! tion. Partition, therefore, is likely to be accomplished,
if the powers can agree as to the division of the spoils.
THE DREYFUS CASE.
IN the Dreyfus case now pending on the question of
revision before the Court of Cassation, which is the
highest tribunal of France, the French Republic,
j and especially the General Staff of the French army,
;is practically on trial. It has evoked much discussion
| and has excited much interest in the United States,
! not merely because of its revelations of personal dis
| honor and its disclosures of deep-seated injustice in
i French jurisprudence when the Government is inter
; ested, but also for the reason that its actual merits
1 have been obscured through race and religious preju
j dices.
Dreyfus, a lieutenant in the French army, was con
j victed and sent to the He dv Diable. where he has
endured great torture, for having written what is
termed a bordereau, or unsigned letter, containing a
list of secret documents in the French War Office, for
I the benefit of the German empire. On his trial five cx
i perts were examined as to the handwriting of this
letter, three of whom testified against him and two for
him. The inherent weakness of this kind of evidence
' has been repeatedly declared in the United States and
â  in Great Britain, but his conviction rested on that
; quality of proof, which has since lost most even of its
; assumed value. It was claimed last year that another â 
i letter to a foreign attache had been discovered which
constituted "la preuve absolve," or demonstrative tes-
I timony. but this letter was speedily admitted to be *
forgery committed by Colonel Henry while the head
of the Intelligence Department of the War Office, and
he died a violent death in prison, either by his own
i hand or in some mysterious way that has not been
S divulged. It has also been asserted that Dreyfus,
whose innocence, so far as the press is informed, has
always been proclaimed by himself, by his devoted wife
' and by a ho^t of discriminating and just people, once
confessed his treasonable act to Captain Lebrun-Re
nault, an officer in the French service; but this after-
I thought, of questionable policy at best, has not been
j even plausibly established. Perhaps the most remark
; able feature in this travesty of justice is that Colonel
yon Schwarzkoppen, the German military attache to
whom the treasonable communication is alleged to
have been made, has always been available as a wit
ness, but the French authorities have studiously omit
ted to call upon him for the direct information that
might conclusively settle the controversy.
The conviction of Dreyfus occurred in 1894. It was
manifestly so insufficiently sustained by the reported
j testimony that it has never commanded public respect,
i much less public indorsement. Outside of France,
and with even greater intensity among millions of the
j French people, embracing statesmen, writers and
I soldiers of the highest standing, belief in his innocence 1
' became so general and the resentment against his ;
' persecutors so vociferous that, after every method of
avoiding further inquiry had been exhausted, the Gov
ernment unwillingly yielded to the pressure and the
pending investigation was instituted. The Court of
! Cassation is now to determine whether or not the con
viction shall stand.
Four Ministers of War, among them Cassaignac,
resisted the efforts for revision, and he placed his op
position, not on the ground that the original proof
I against Dreyfus justified his punishment, but upon "la
preuve ahsolue." which almost immediately after he
t had announced his conclusion turned out to be a forg-
I cry. Perhaps next to his wife, the strongest advocate
fnr Dreyfus has been Colonel Picquart, who has been
honored in the London Times as "the noblest and
most touching figure which has ever reconciled phil
i osophy with humanity." This brave and fearless gen
: tleman claims that on the trial of Dreyfus document
ary evidence, false in itself and which he had no op
portunity to controvert, was secretly communicated
to the court, and he has been imprisoned and is to be
j tried, apparently because of his manhood and of his
â  fidelity. The existence of some diplomatic papers in
the Foreign Office of the French Government tending
to show guilt, but which Dreyfus never saw, is also

referred to as a proof of the inventive genius of his un
scrupulous prosecutors. The fact that Dreyfus did not
write the unsigned letter upon which he was con
victed has been at. least presumptively shown, but an
I attempt to fasten it upon Count Esterhazy, which ap
peared to be well founded, has legally failed, and the
I manner of the failure is one of the numerous degrad
ing episodes in the prolonged melodrama. Esterhazy '
I was tried for having written the bordereau and ac
, quitted. He was then accused of having had treason
able correspondence with a foreign attache, and a sec
ond acquittal followed. After these proceedings,
I which were in the line of resistance to revision of the
judgment against Dreyfus, he was practically removed
from the French army for-"inconduite habituelle," an
indefinite charge, which may be surmised to mean that
he was habitually guilty of violations of discipline.
Esterhazy, however, fled to London, where upon his ;
oath he has published a narrative of his connection j
with the Dreyfus case that shows astounding fraud in
the General Staff of the French army, limited, how
ever, to that particular branch of the service. From
his statement, fortified by numerous confirmatory
documents, some of them original and some of them
photographs, it appears that the determination of the j
: General Staff, by dark intrigues and falsehoods, to I
' override the sentiment in favor of Dreyfus and per- j
petuate the crime of his incarceration, was so fixed '
that subordinate officers were induced to commit the
most reprehensible acts and were then shielded, in the j
j first instance from exposure and, when that could not
be avoided, from conviction. In his own case, he
; shows that his habit of obedience was used in con
i cocted interviews and correspondence and in publica
! tions in the French newspapers to resist the possible
; vindication of Dreyfus, and that on both of his trials
! the official source of his prosecution surreptitiously
furnished him with his defense.
It is possible, although highly improbable, that Drey
fus is guilty, but it is beyond argument in any country
where the English language is spoken that his guilt
; has never been legally proved and that his conviction
and punishment represent tyranny and corruption to
a degree absolutely incompatible with the maintenance
;of republican institutions. Our traditional sympathy
with France, our love of self-government and our re
spect for the Court of Cassation inspire the hope that
publicity and law may cleanse the impurities in the
French military service and that justice will now be
thoroughly if tardily vindicated.
AT SENATOR TELLER'S HOME.
WHILE Colonel Bryan and his fellow apostles
of the cause of free silver are exerting all their
energies to hold together the organization of
'96, that motley host of discontent is rapidly disap
pearing from politics. It seems indeed to be some
thing like the proverbial rope of sand whose particles
separate from one another and slip from the hand of
the weaver no matter how arduously he bends himself
to the task of weaving them together.
We have noted the revolt of the intelligence of the
South against the position in which it has been placed
by the Chicago movement, and the demand of repre
sentative papers of that section for a new leader and a
new platform. The people of the Middle West and of
the Pacific Coast showed by their votes last fall that
among them the old free silver faction had disinte
grated; and it now appears that even in the silver
State of Colorado a similar condition prevails.
From the Denver Times we learn that even in Gil
pin County, the home of Senator Teller, the so-called
Silver Republican organization has gone to pieces.
It quotes from the Gilpin County Miner the state
ment: "The Silver Republican party in this county
was murdered in the executive session of the city con
vention last Saturday evening, and there is no longer
a Silver Republican party in Gilpin County." Com
menting upon that report, made doubly significant by
the fact that it comes from what is not only the home
of Senator Teller but one of the most notable silver
producing districts of the State, the Times says:
"Prosperity has changed conditions in Colorado
already, but the greatest factor in bringing about this
changed sentiment was the fusion of last fall. There is
not a man in Colorado who does not feel keenly the
disgraceful blot upon the State as a result of fusion.
Governor Charles S. Thomas in a recent speech de
livered at a Democratic mass meeting said: 'Fusion
has been demonstrated a failure.' Republicans should
take courage from these little indications. They tell
the story of the future. Denver will go Republican
this spring, the county will go Republican next fall
and at the next national election in 1900 Colorado will
roll up an old-time majority for the Republican
ticket."
Thus the evidences of returning reason among the
folly inspired hosts that followed Bryan in the last
Presidential campaign multiply on every side. In the
West the people are not only adverse to a further agi
tation of the silver movement, but are disgusted with
the whole system of fusion politics. Not even the
strong personal influence of Senator Teller among his
neighbors, friends and political supporters in his own
city and county can prevent that adverse sentiment
and that disgust from manifesting themselves.
Whatever may be the form that opposition to Re
publicanism takes in 1900, it will not be that which
made so much noise in the last campaign. In the sun
shine of a restored prosperity the old Bryanite fusion
is vanishing like a fop from the political sky.
It is to be hoped that the young woman who has
sued a man for so squeezing her hand as to break a
lot of useful bones will get every cent for which she
asks. The incident occurred in Philadelphia, but it
might have taken place anywhere, for no section is
free from the muscular freak who likes to show his
strength by torturing his friends.
There will be many people in San Francisco glad to
learn that Anderson has been made a brigadier gen

and that his superiors were inclined to give him the
cold shoulder had been suspected.

CALIFORNIA MINING AFFAIRS.
The State Mining Bureau has got fully
settled in its new and attractive quarters
in the Ferry building and during the week
Curator Durden opened the museum to
the public. The number of visitors al
ready shows an increase.
The field work of this institution and
its publications are pretty well known,
but not much is known of its Interesting
Inside work, which in a direct and private
way reaches with more or less benefit
thousands of people interested in mining.
While its general affairs are under the
able direction of State Mineralogist A. S.
Cooper the benefits of the bureau are di
rectly dispensed by expert employes who
are well known in the mining world.
One interesting feature of the work is
the laboratory, which Is In charge of E.
B. Preston, who has been with the bureau
for so many years. Part of the business
of the laboratory is to make, free assays
for any Callfornians who send in rock
samples which they want to know about.
To prevent too much competition with
the professional assayers the bureau may
give only qualitative' and not quantitative
analyses. The samples are assayed and the
owner [a told what they contain, but not
the percentage of each component or how
much the rock is worth per ton. This an
alysis, however, is often all that is need
ed and may be worth more to a miner
than assay for gold alone. Any prospe.t
or in the State who wonders and guesses
and hopes about What Is in his puzzling
ledge may find out r're-e of cost by bring
ing or mailing samples. Since the recent
find of rich tellurlde ores mi Coffee Cre< k
there has been a amount of pros
pecting lor tellurides, which few Califor
nia miners know anything about, and
many sampks have been sent In for an
alysis. Bach prospector learns whether
or not telluride, gold, copper, etc., is in
his ore. In this one way the State has
aided thousands of prospectors who were
in doubt about their finds.
The number of such analyses made
varies from thirty to fifty per month
While gold ores predominate, every min
eral in the State gets represented. With
in the past month Fuller's earth from
San Bernardino and Kern counties, cop
per orea from everywhere, mica, cinnabar,
mineral water, coal, etc.. have been re
ported on by Assayer Preston.
I'.ut these rree analyses are but a slight
part of the mining information for which
the mining public constantly draws on
the bureau. There is a constant stream
of questions <>;i every conceivable mining
topic and some that are inconceivable.
l-'rom ten to fifteen letters of inquiry
come a day and every hour some
body is dropping in to ask in person.
Probably 5000 such letters are answered
yearly and the number of people person
ally answered is large. Most inquiries
are from California and are supposed to
be. but the line is not drawn chis- .
Librarian Jacobs receives and answ.-rs
most inquiries and it keeps him busy, but
there are ethers about who are pretty
sure to know this or that. Mr. Preston
and C. Mathyas have traveled every
county in the State for years tor the bur
eau and they and Curator Durden, James
Means, Statistician Yale and others have
been giving miscellaneous information for
years and have eneyclopediac funds of
pointers. Then there is a reference
library of several thousand volumes to
consult.
Recently an Eastern woman wrote to
know about John Doe, who went to min
ing here In 1554. There is a constant in
ijulry about mining law and especially
trie law of locations. Every grade of min
ing intelligence is repress :.:â¢ <'.. Many
want to go lato mining and want to
know what books to read. Many want
to know where to go to prospect. There
is a great inquiry about Coffee Creek and
the whole northern region. The value
of mica, California iron ores, hanging
walls, the cyanide process. Lassen I '
mines, copper mines, binding material
for diatomaceous earth and how to cheap
ly settle mud In borax solutions containi
ng magnesia were among the many sub
jects of Inquiry received in March, Metal
lurgical difficulties of every sort are pro-
Bented. Peculiar difficulties in gold mill-
Ing how to build an arastra, the grade
of a sluice box and troubles with chlori
nation are other samples. Inquiries come
from all over the world, for the reputa
tion of the bureau is high and widespread.
The other day there rame from Sydney a
query as to the greatest depth kaolin has
been found in Australia and elsewhere in
the world, and Mr. Jacobs will try to
tell.
Women interested in mining are fre
quent inquirers, and expert mining en
gineers as well as green prospectors are
constantly served. While the bureau is
not at all a mining school, every practi
cal inquiry made is answere and thou
sands are helped to success in develop
ing the mining resources of the State.
It is at the free service of the public,
and if information cannot be given or one
wants to know too much, the inquirer Is
told where to find it. In the develop
ment of the broadening oil fields of the
State the bureau has recently done an
especially valuable work.
It may be observed that in the bureau
but two employes besides the State Min
eralogist receive as much as $150 a
month, and there are men of high tech
nical attainments and much mining ex
perience who are paid less than wharf
ingers and policemen.
For the coming two years the bureau
has its usual appropriation of $25,000 a
yi>ar. and the State Mineralogist has
planned a large amount of scientific field
work and much to be published. And
with the inrp'ased activity in mining the
personal demands for Its practical heip
fulness will be Increased.
Colorado and Arizona have just estab
lished State mining bureaus patterned

One of the mining stories of : the week
tells of George Nelson and Henry Loring,
two prospectors, being chased by a pack
of hungry wolves into the mouth of a
mine , tunnel near Pleasant Valley the
other clay. The picks and shovels left in
the tunnel provided weapons with which
the hungry. enemy were. kept.at bay until
daylight. Being miners, of course the
besieged could wield pickaxes effectively
in a tunnel, whereas excited tenderfeet
would have knocked themsel-ves or each
other in the head for the benefit of the
hungry wolves. It is one characteristic
of gold mining that it stimulates the im
agination powerfully.
"Sniping" has been a lively industry
during the past week or .two where con
ditions are favorable in the placer gold
regions. This sport consists in hunting
along dry gulches or gravelly deposits
by watercourses over which recent floods
coursed exposing now and then a nugget
in the debris brought from the beds of
the watercourses above or washed out of
banks. Boys, men and women hustle out
to gather gold, though baskets are not
required. Local papers here and there
record that Johnny found a nugget worth
$2 50 or $7 and some times much more
valuable finds are reported.
R. H. Norton has resigned as State
Coal Mine Inspector of Washington to

of Washington increased in 1898 from
1. 192 tons for 1897 to 1,810,239 tons. From
1892 to 1897 the product was nearly sta
tionary. From 1892 to 1596 each 37,244 tons
cost a human life. Protective laws and
inspection raised the product per fatal
accident to 190,320 tons for 1897-98.
The tunnel in the Red Point drift mine
in Placer County is now in 12,700 feet, or
over two and a quarter miles. There are
fifty-nine men on the payroll and an av

day, using seven horses to tram the
gravel out.
There are fourteen hydraulic mines in
Eastern Placer County which had re

Owing to lack of water, only one has been

increased.

Nearly all the naval powers are recon
structing a number of their old armor

method of putting new armor on top of
the old was first tried in the Turkish navy
at the suggestion of Woods Pasha, a

I adopted by Germany, followed by Italy,
and lastly by Denmark, where the Odin,
built In 1573. has had Harveyised steel put
over the old armor. The drawback to
this operation is that the increased pro
tection is gained at the expense of the
C'-.al-carrying capacity, but in vessels in
tended for harbor defense a few Inches
more draught will not Impair their use

going vessels would have disastrous re

board, the average speed was 33.6 knots.
This course was covered in 32 minutes and

Notwithstanding the presence in Asiat

besides those of China and Japan, piracy
is sometimes heard of as having taken
place on the coast, and cases are quite
frequent on the Canton and West rivers.
During the past year no less than eighty
attacks by pirates on those rivers have
been reported to the authorities, and the
British Consul at Canton has made vigor

gesting that the old German torpedo
boats, of which twelve axe lying at
Whampoa, be utilized in suppressing the
piracy. The suggestion was adopted, and
two of these sixteen-knot boats were sent

MORE SCORCHING
ON MARKET STREET
Two Little Girls Knocked Down by ft
Bicyclist and SavÂ«d From Serioua
Injury by Their Father.
The efforts of the Associated Cycling
Clubs and the police to put a stop to
scorching on Market street have had a
salutary effect, but there are still reck
less riders who defy the law, and two
young girls had a narrow escape yester
day afternoon from serious injury by ons
of them.
Adam Miller, 646^ Minna street, was
crossing Market street at Sixth with hi 3
three young daughters just as a number
of bicyclists belonging to the Bay City
Club approached the crossing from the
ferry. According to eye-witnesses they
were riding at a speed of about eight
miles an hour. One of them was zigzagin*
and as the Millers had almost reached the
sidewalk in front of the Donohoe build
ing he dashed into the family. Two of
the girls, Louisa and Alma, were knocked
down and Miller grabbed hold of the
bicycle to prevent it passing over the
pro"strate form of the girls. He also
caught hold of the cyclist, but was un
able to hold him, and he made his escape
in the crowd that quickly gathered.
Dr. C. T. Rea, 904 McAllister street,
saw the collision and he made the remark
that bicyclists evidently thought that
foot pedestrians had no rights. Ivan R.
Lang, a machinist, who claimed that the
bicycle belonged to him, shook his fist
in the doctor's face and said he w r as an
"old crank." Dr. Rea went in search of
a policeman and while he was gone sev
eral wheelmen tried to take the bicycle
away from Miller, but he clung to it and
held it till Policeman O'Keefe appeared.
There was no bell on the machine and
Lang who claimed it, although both Mil
ler and Dr. Rea declared he was not the
man who was riding it, was arrested and
taken to the City Prison, Where a charge
of riding a bicycle without a bell was
booked against him. One of his friends
put up $5 cash bail for him and he was
released. Several cyclists, followed Lang
to prison and held an indignation meet
ing outside. Two or three hot-headed
youths wanted to wait until Miller came
from Captain Spillane's office and do him
up, but wiser counsels prevailed.
The two little girls were fortunately not
hurt except for the shaking up they got,
but it was no fault of the bicyclist that
they were not seriously injured. The
wheel has been retained by the police aa
evidence against Lang.

ESCAPED FROM

J. Goodman an Al
leged Defaulter.
Honolulu business and social circles are
deer.l}' agitated over the alleged elope
ment of J. Goodman with $20,000 belonging
to the Electric Light Company of that
city under circumstances that are of un
usual interest.
Goodman arrived In this city with his
plunder five days ago on the steamship !
Australia, but as his name did not. appear
on the passenger list nothing was known
about his flight and coming until the Nip
pon Maru came into port yesterday with
details of the affair.
j Goodman, it appears, was a trusted em
-1 ploye of the Electric Company, rnjoying

ROBERT McCULLOUGH
DROWNED IN A LAKE
Lost His Life Within Six Feet of His
Friends.
ROBERT McCtJLLOUGH, one of the most popular young men In tÂ»iÂ» city,
who has been a driver for Jackson's Napa Soda Works for the last twelve
years, lost his life yesterday at 12 o'clock in a small lake at Point San
Pedro, in San Matoo County. McCullough, with twelve others, started
from this city on Saturday evening, as had been their custom for a number of
years, for the purpose of hunting along the lakes oordering the ocean at
the place where he lost his life yesterday. After their arrival at the place
designated they separated, and McCuliougrh, with William Sidell, William
Bacon and one other whose name could not be learned, got into a small boat
for the purpose of crossing a pond of water which had been created by the
recent rains. After getting away from the shore about six feet the boat cap
sized and the four occupants were thrown into the pond, which was ten feet
deep. McCullough sank to the bottom and Sidell had gone down twice when he
waÂ« rescued with the other two. Search weus instantly made for the body
of McCullough. and it was brought rushore.
The Coroner of San Mateo County was notified at Redwood City and he
arrived with his assistant and empaneled a jury over the remains.
The dead man was in his twenty-sixth year. He leaves with his young
widow one child, a little boy, Harold, aged 5 years, besides an aged father
and three sisters, all residing in this city, where he was born and raised. He
was a member of the Young Men's Institute and belonged to Lodge No. 7.
Aside from McCullough's popularity in the wide circle of his numerous
customers, he was universally liked and respected for his generous nature. He
received the nomination from the Republican party last year for the Assembly
in the Thirty-third District. He was defeated by twenty-three votes.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, APRTL 3, 1899,
him until after his flight became known.
The day the Australia sailed from Hono
lulu Goldman managed to stow himself
on board through the assistance of
frienris but unknown to anybody connect
ed with the ship, and kppt himself con
cealed until after the vessel was well out
side Diamond Head. Then he came forth
from his hiding place, paid his fare and \
was assigned to a stateroom. Goldman's i
object in stowing himself away instead of |
quietly purchasing a ticket was to avoid
having his name appear on the printed
passenger list, which was issued and dis
tributed before the steamer sailed. Had
he pursued the ordinary course his in
tended flight would have been known
hours before the Australia sailed.
Arriving in this city Goodman came
nshore as soon as the ship docked, and
has disappeared nobody knows where.
"When the Nippon Maru sailed from
Honolulu, although Goodman's flight was
common comment, his friends were indus
triously engaged In endeavoring to effect
a compromise of some sort with the com
pany whereby Goodman would escape
prosecution. It is confidently . believed
that some arrangement will be made so
that he will not be subjected to fear 01
arrest in this country.
Mrs. Goodman is now disposing of her
effects in Honolulu, and it is stated that
she will come here and join her husband
in a short time. It is the Impression in
the Islands that Goodman will not go very
far from San Francisco until after his
wife arrives, but will keep out of sight
until then.

FIGHT FOR THE
PITTANCE LEFT BY
THE OLD BOARD
Teachers Not Anxious for the
Plan of Compromise Sub
mitted by the Merchants.
They Want No Interference With the
Funds for the Current Monthsâ A Sub
stitute to Be Considered To-Day.
THERE Is much Interest being shown
In the meeting of teachers which has
been called for this afternoon to dis
cuss the possibilities of securing part
of their back pay. The discussion hinges
on the question of a compromise with the
merchants, and It has already consumed
the time of three sessions. It will come
to a vote to-day, however, and the matter
will be decided one way or the other.
The offer of the merchants comes in the
form of a report from a committee which
had been appointed to negotiate on the
question and settle it If possible, but the
report of the committee has not met with
the unanimous favor of the teachers;
there is much opposition to it. The oppo
sition Is based principally on the ground
that the compromise as offered provides
for the payment of the merchants at the ]
expense of the teachers, leaving the
teachers no better off than they were be
fore. There is also involved the old ques
tion as to the application of the one
twelfth act; In fact, the whole case prac
tically turns on that same act.
The compromise offered by the mer
chants is this: The teachers are to allow
the merchants to collect the full amount
of their claimsâ a total of something over
$88,000. This would use up the balance â¢
on hand from the first half of the current
fiscal year, amounting to over $35,000, and ;
about $53,000 of the funds necessary for |
the department for the months from Jan- I
vary to June. The compromise further
provides that one-half of the amount coi
lected, or $44,000, be turned over to the [
teachers at once, and In return that they j
transfer to a trustee their warrants for
the months of November and December,
the unpaid months that are causing more
than half the trouble; that the trustee ]
sue the city for the same and if he sue- [
ceed in securing payment he Is to pay !
the teachers one-half of their salary claim j
and then divide the remainder between
the merchants and the teachers pro rata. j
It is provided, however, that no money
secured by the trustee on the teachers'
warrants is to interfere with the amount
now on hand to run the School Depart- i
ment until the new fiscal year in July.
In this way it is expected that the
teachers will at once receive the half of
the $35,000, and later will get the half
of the $53,000 collected from the remain
ing funds of the year. At the end of the
year this will leave the fund short, be
sides the two months lost. $53, Qu0, but of I
this the teachers will have been given !
$44,000, and it is figured the difference be- ;
tween the shortage of Â§so,o<K> and the I
$44,1100 received, or $WA>O, will be the total
loss to the teachers in addition to thÂ« '
two months.
The $35,000 is now under Injunction by
the teachers and none of It can be paid
until that injunction is withdrawn. If the
Injunction holds, the teachers will be
compelled to put up bonds to the amount
of the claims of the merchants, and to
do this. It is Bald, it will be necessary to
hypothecate the warrants of at least one I
month not In dispute. If this be not j
[ done then the injunction suit must be !
dismissed. In that case it is claimed by |
the merchants that they can step in and
take the entire $35,000 for themselves and j
enough more to pay their claims in full.
But here the opposition's side of the
case comes up. The opposing teachers
claim they stand an equal chance of get
ting their money with the merchants and
they do not admit that the merchants ar<'
preferred creditors in any sense. And
even if they were the teachers claim that
they can only secure the $35,000. The mer
chants tried once to tie up the funds ot
the second half of the fiscal year, but
Judge Scawell dissolved the injunction
and salaries for the months of January
and February have already been paid
and the March warrants will be issued in
a few days. As It now stands, the teach
ers have lost two months' pay. There is
sufficient money in the treasury to run
the department, so far as salaries are
concerned, until July and leave no one un
paid. This money, the teachers claim,
cannot be touched, and they point to
Judge Seawell's decision in support of
their position. So far as assigning their I
warrants is concerned, it is the opinion ]
of the opposition that this will merely put
into the hands of the merchants a tan
gible claim against t..e department,
whereas if they had no such claim their
claims for merchandise would become
outlawed at the expiration of the present
fiscal year, a benefit wholly to the mer
chants*, as it allows them to attach the
funds for the current months.
Already there has been paid by the
teachers 2 per cent of their monthly sal
aries for litigation expenses, and the
amount bids fair to be larger before they
have done. BeHldes this, there is a feel-
Ing that while there may be some doubt
over the claims to the $35,000 and who is
to be preferred In the payment, there
can be no doubt about the safety of the
money for the remainder of the year un
der Judge Sfawell's decision. For that i
reason many are of the opinion that the,
teachers should try to secure as much of
the $35,000 as possible, and let the mat- |
ter rest there, trusting to the future to
provide some means of paying the un
paid months, instead of adding to the
shortage. In any event, they figure
they can come out no nearer than two
months and $8000 under the compromise,
while if the compromise is rejected they
will be only the two months to the bad,
leaving out of the question the $35,000.
For this reason a substitute for the
compromise plan has been presented to
the teachers, and It is that which will he |
voted on to-day. This compromise pro- :
vide? that the teachers withdraw their
injunction on the $35,000 and allow the
whole amount to go to the merchants,
provided that the merchants will make
no legal assault on the funds for the
current six months. This will allow the
merchants. It is claimed, enough to en
able them to await the time when by con
stitutional amendment their claims can
be adjusted; and even then, it is set
forth, they are better off than the teach
ers, for that $35,000 represents but a frac
tion of their business, while to the teach
ers the amount it represents means their
whole earnings for two months. With
the question settled to that extent it is
believed both sides can await the further
relief provided for in the bill recently
I pnssed by the legislature.
There is another faction, too, which
docs not believe in quietly relinquishing
all claim to the $35,000. They claim they
;irc entitled not only to the half of It, but
that portion which should go to them if
the amount were divided according to the
relative sizes of the claims. The teachers'
demands amount to about $180,000, the
merchants' to about $SB.OOO and they want
the $35,000 divided in that proportion. They
declare the merchants' demands were con
tracted for in excess of the one-twelfth
act and so are not legal claims and they
are willing to test the matter in the
courts. Should they get any of this they
will come out less than two months be
hind, instead of two months and $9000, as
the compromise provides.
The committee proposing the comprom- I
ise plan does not urge the measure as its
own. The members have stated that the
plan is to them the best in sight and for
that reason they wish to see it adopted,
but If the teachers do not wish it they are
willing that it should be passed over.
At the meeting to-day only those who
have paid all previous litigation expenses
and who will promise to pay all those to
accrue, will be allowed to vote. The bal
lot has been specially prepared, and on
It is a pledge that the voter has paid and
will pay whatever is his Bhare of the
expenses. On the end of the ballot
Is a detachable slip on which the voter
must write his vote, "yes" or "no," and
after detaching it pass his pledge to the
election officer and deposit his slip in
the ballot-box. The ballot as printed is
made to relate to the compromise: as
the substitute is the question to be voted
on/ the ballot must be changed to read
"substitute" instead of "compromise."
Altogether the whole business is in the
prettiest kind of a mess, and the meet
ing promises to be a lively one.
LIEUTENANT PRICE
UTILIZES HIS WITS
SIEZES GANG OF HIGHBINDERS
BY THE QUEUES.
Subdues Nine Brutal Rioters in a
Melee at 5 Brannan Place
Last Night.
There was a lively Chinese war at 5
Brannan place last evening In which
Lieutenant Price played a high hand
and landed nine of the combating Ori
; entals in the California police station soon
! after 9 o'clock. The affair took place in
j a den where the Wong Gong Har Society,
a branch of the See Yups, was transact
ing the business of the tong.
Chang Chung, who caused the racket,
is a merchant of Merced, and, according
to the officers, came to this city to collect
! a bill which was due him from the Wong
i Gong Hors. The bill was disputed, where
, upon Chung produced his orders. Dur
| ing the conversation Wong Sic Dip acted
! as spokesman, and when he saw how the
| tide of affairs was running struck Chung
! with a chair. Immediately the entire
j tong, consisting of eight burly China
men, pitched upon the unfortunate cred
itor. Clubs, lamps, chairs, pokers and
all available articles were used as
weapons. After the struggle had contin
ued for some time and gore began to
flow, one of the crowd rushed out and
informed Lieutenant Price. The officer
entered the room and, catching the nine
Celestials by the queues, soon stopped
the fracas. Officers King, Butler, Tay
lor and Bonner made their appearance
i and assisted the lieutenant in arresting
| the band. Chang Chung received a deep
gash nn the forehead and was sent to the
I Harbor Hospital for treatment. Wong Sic
j Dip also had a portion of the cuticle on
his face removed by the leg of a chair,
but was not seriously hurt. The other
Chinamen engaged in the fight were
Wong Lang. Gang Yet, Wong Han, Wong
Sic Wy, Wong- Hoey, Wong Bon and
Wong Lin.
Price combated the entire g-angofstrug
gling Chinese single-handed for several
minutes and escaped without a scratch.
Later, several lottery dens were raided
by Lieutenant Price and the same officers
and four arrests were made.
LILY POST NEAR TO DEATH.
The Popular Opera Singer Is Not Ex
pected to Live.
Lily Post, the well-known and popular
opera singer, who was taken to the Re
ceiving Hospital a few days ago by her
friends to be examined for insanity, has
steadily grown worse, notwithstanding
the excellent care she has received.
When it was declared that her mind
was shattered her husband undertook to
r move her to a private asylum, but her
condition was such as to prevent him
from so doing, and she has since remained
at the city Institution. Late last night It
was reported that the unfortunate young
woman was failing rapidly and that her
malady had progressed to such a stage
that there Is little hope of her recovery.
] Her husband and mother have been at
her bedside since the day of her misfor
tune and all that good nursing and med
ical skill could do has been done to save
her life.
The passing of this jolly, sweet-voiced
footllgnt favorite would be sincerely re
gretted by her many friends, not only
here, but throughout the country, and the
crisis In her case will be awaited with
genuine concern.

ANOTHER SENSATIONAL GAME
SACRAMENTO PLAYS A "RINGER"
WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS.
San Jose Turns the Tables on Wat
sonville and Captures a Re
markably Close Exhi
bition.
Hank Harris thinks it would be about
the proper thing for the Supervisors to
retire Fire Chief Sullivan and promote
J. Fitzpatrick to the head of the de
partment in recognition of his great ser
vice to a large and assorted lot of ball
cranks and a petition to that effect will
obtain Uncle's unanimous support. Satur
day the tireman, after fighting the big
Fremont street conflagration all of the
night before, went into the box for the
local ball team and pitched fourteen in
ning of gilt-edge ball against the Sacra
mantis. That he did not win the game
no fault of his. but was due tv a
jagged hole in his support.
Yesterday Fitz went into the box again
against the same aggregation of sluggers
and had them completely at his :.
throughout the game. Only one of their
three runs was batted in, that scored in
the ninth, the other two being the off
spring of large, flagrant bungle.-. Fitz
has pitched the three games Frisco has
played this season and proved himself
a master hand in his deportment in all
of them.
It is not surprising that his manager
thinks some suitable recognition of his
prowess is in order. Failing to get the
Supervisors to take action Hank is con
sidering the propriety of giving Fitz a
bill of sale to his cigar stand. Such is the
reward of genius.
When Hank learned that the visitors
intended to put Hughes in the box yes-
SOME REAR ELEVATIONS SEEN AT RECREATION PARK.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, APRIL 3, 1899.
terday he was filled with wrath and im
-1 mediately filed another protest. At the
(lose of the turmoil, however, when his
linatlon had broken its string of de
feats and reversed Saturday's score of 4
1 to S, taking the long end themselves, his
i wrath gave way to sweetest smiles, and
'â  as Scorer Joe Stapleton left the grounds
i Harris called after him: "Never mind
that protest. Joe."
The protest against Saturday's game
will be considered by the managers at a
meeting a week from Wednesday night.
Hughes pitched for the visitors and was
, a soft one in two innings, when the na
; tlves bunched three nice, long, run-getting
drives on him in each. Hughes claims he
I has not signed with either Baltimore or
Brooklyn yet, as he is holding 1 out for
more money. The local men hope hi
not go East at all, lor they look upon
him mÂ» being in the nature of a cinch. He
may be able to shut Boston out without
a hit, but he is nectar for the home team.
There was a great crowd at Recreation
Park to witness the game, the largest
ever in the grounds except on footuall
days. All of them took their lungs with
them and found plenty of opportunity to
exercise the air pumps. It was a Frisco
crowd, although the rooters were gener
ous and bestowed ample applause on
Peeples, Meaney and the otner Sacra
mentans for their clever work. Every
body Btayi d till the last man was out,
and they were glad they did, for the game
closed and victory rested with Uncle's
men with a thrilling double play after the
visitors had scored one run and were
within one run uf tieing the score.
The game was as fully interesting,
inning for inning, as the one on the preÂ«
(.ediiiK day, and baseball may safely be
said to be firmly re-established in the
htarls of the populace. Every half
inning produced one or more plays that
ignited tne cranks, the star single plays
â¢ -handi d scorching
line foul after a hard run by Peeples, and
a long-distance race with a Bkyr
fly by Meaney, in which the fielder won
by a finj I Three double plays con
tributed to th> excitement, while the
comedy was furnished in the third
when Pyne got caught between third and
theplate, and, . g chased up and
down the line for a time, succeeded In
k to third owing to the neglect
;o back up Pe< pies.
Bacn mento introduced another colt,
young Keitz, a brother of the only Hank.
Like the National l>>:'.guer, he co\
nd and ni.ule a ni"st favorabU- im
pression. He handles himself exceedingly
well.
For two innings the game ran alonj*
without a hit or a run, and then the Na
tives fink Hughes' measurement and
batted out the game right there. Har'.
man opened with a single. Fitzpatrick
scientifically sacrificing him to second.
Pyne laced out a triple to the left field
fence, scoring Hartman. Riley sent a
grounder to Peeples, who sent the ball
home to head off Pyne, and for a time it
looked as though it was all day with the
â¢ doctor. He finally managed to get back
to third, Joshua in the meantime having
jogged around to the second corner. Krug
i drove a grounder to Sheehan, who caught
; Pyne at the plate. But Sullivan caught
i the ball fair fon a double to right ar.d
I both Riley and Krug tallied.
Krug let Sacramento have a run in the
i fourth. Meaney led off with a smiri-\
; st<">le second and reached third while fee*
plea find Doyle wore being- retired in ordt r
at first on infield grounders. Hughes
orove a liner into Krug's hands, but it
was too hot for him to hold and Meaney
reached home.
Frisco made its last run in the sixth.
With one out Pyne made a scratch hit,
Riley flew to Meaney, after which inter
esting event Krug plucked another single.
Sullivan followed with his second double,
scoring Pyne. Hilderbrandt ended the
bombardment with a high fly to Shana
han.
Hughes, for Sacramento, got around (n
the seventh on O'Neil's fumble of his
grounder, a steal to second, third on x
passed ball and home on Shanahan's
single. Their last run came in the ninth.
With one out, Doyle touched off a double
and scored on Hughes" single, being given
the benefit of a close decision at the plate.
The score:

THING OF THE DAY.
The Talent Thought Theron Would

Out in the Sixth
Hound.
Rocket, the fleet hound owned by H.
A. Deckelraan, won the open stake at
Union Park yesterday In the presence of
5000 spectators. False Flatterer was !
runner-up. The day was a great one for
coursing admirers, and up to the finals
It was a hard task to select the winner,
as all the hounds participating' in the ;
stake were in fine form and the hares !
were also very strong, which is unusual |
at this time of the year. The favorites j
won nearly all the courses, the hottest j
thing In the day that was handed out <
being Miller's Rabble in the second â 
round, the dog defeating Gladiator at the j
good odds of 7 to 1. The course might
without prejudice be called a lucky one
for the Pasha kennels' entry, as he won !
by the hare favoring him. Gladiator in !
the run-up secured the lead and the first j
two turns, but he lay off his game for a ;
few brief moments and the shortenders' I
choice made a few turns and the kill. j
Rollicking Airs made a great showing in ;
the stake, and was not retired from tne \
lists until the fifth round, when she was
put out by False Flatterer after a no
go. Theron was in fine form and secured ;
third money. He was up against i
hard game all day and will no doubt win
a stake in the near future if he can be
kept up to his present form. The course
between The Devil and High Flyer was
both exciting and amusing. The hounds
were slipped to a great hare, who ran \
the dogs to a lively pace in all kinds
of rings and circles. The Devil was the
best in close work, but when the hare
started out for a run across the field
High Flyer showed the speed. The Devil
had made all the score and won the
flag.
The results of the day were as follows:
Open stake, first roundâ J. Dean's Moondyne

Los Angeles Coursing.
T.OR ANGELES, April 2.â The feature
of the coursing at Agricultural Park to
day was a match race between Orpheum
Lass and Merry Maiden for $100 a Bide,
which was won by the latter in easy
style after a bad break by the Lass at
the beginning, which necessitated consid
erable delay.
The regular programme consisted of a
16-dog puppy stake, the first ever run in
Southern California, which brought out
a lot of high-class youngsters. First
money was won by Adams' Her Grace, a
Hadlwist-Lady I,owe dog. with P. Fer
raris' Milano (Punch-Sicily) second,
American Bervitv (Dakota Chief-Beauty)
third, and miss Wid (Nitz-La Fiesta
Queen) fourth.
In the open stake Dryden's Mountain
Belle won first money, with Snug second
and Duty third.
The longest course of the day was be
tween Snug and Master Jack (a bye),
which necessitated drawing Snug in the
final. There were two special races, Mer
ry Maiden defeating Mountain Belle and
Moloch easily putting out Headstrong.
The crowd was the largest that hns been
at the park for several weeks, the grand
stand being well filled. Among the out
of-town visitors was George W. Rose of
San Francisco and party, who left for
the north to-night.

GREAT COPPER MINES
OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA
IMMENSE MONTHLY OUTPUT OF
RICH ORE.
"The peeople residing in other portions !
of our State do not realize the import- ;
ance of developments now under way in
Northern California, mainly In the coun
ties of Shasta. Trinity and Siskiyou, and
relating principally to the mining indus
try," said M. E. Dltimar of Redding,
who with his wife is stopping at the ;
Grand Hotel, to a Call reporter.
"The same conditions that have bulld
ed up Butte and Anaconda in Montana,"
continued he, "are operating in Shasta
County in the vicinity of Redding, and
the value of the copper output of that
district will not at the present time fall
far short of $500,000 per month. Develop
ment work now in progress will increase I
the value of this yield several fold, anal
the latent possibilities of the copper belt
offer reasonable encouragement for the
investment of large capital.
"The Mountain Copper Company (Lim
ited), operating large smelters at Kes
wick, six miles out of Reading are em
ploying from twelve hundred to niteen
hundred men directly, and half as many
more indirectly. Ore is in sight sufficient
to run the smelters at the present large
capacity of fully SOO tons per day for
many years, and an additional ore body
has been developed within the past year
fully doubling the original expectations
Â°4 b UrU, credit*; I with be
e ess c-rSr^eio l P
mem work on the Golinsky group of
copper mines on Backbone ( reek, about
eighteen miles north of Redding. Work
already done virtually assures the im
mediate operation on a very large scale
of these mines. In the same vicinity an
other large deposit of these sulphide ores
is being developed by New cap
ital. This property is known as the
Mammoth group, and is owned by R. M.
Sentzer, Joseph Kahny, Anton Jaegel
and Jack Wallace. Development has ex
posed an ore body of good grade, carrjing
gold, silver and copper, seventy feet in
from one wall, with the face of tne
crosscut still in solid ore. .
"To the northeast of Redding other
large bodies of ore of a similar character
are developing. The Black Diamond
mine, at the head of Stillwater, is under
bond to a German syndicate. The Bully
Hill mine is producing copper ore of fui
licient value to admit of hauling twenty
live miles and shipping to Selby's, while
on other parts of the big crosscut stoped
copper belt, half encircling Redding In
its sweep of forty miles, development
work is In progress on a smaller scale, but
offering almost universal encouragement
to the owners.
"Quartz development is thriving as a
result of the opportunities offered for
the economical treatment of silicious ores
by the smelters. Shasta County already
records several notable instances of the
opening up of rich gold mines, due solely
to the opportunities that the smelters
present. Trinity and Siskiyou Counties
follow closely on the heels of Shasta and
the mining outlook Is very bright
throughout Northern California. The re
serve of moisture is ample to assure a
long season in hydraulic mining, and
Trinity and portions of Siskiyou offer un
usual possibilities in this character of
mining. The hydraulic mines of Trinity
are among the largest in the world, with
no impedimenta in the way of full opera
tions, such as the central counties must
overcome.
"The rinding of rich tellurides in Trin
ity promises to result in considerable de
velopment in the quartz of that section
as soon as the disappearance of the snow
will permit of work in the higher alti
tudes. All in all, the outlook could not
be brighter for the rapid development of
our section of the State than is now pre
sented."
Mr. Dittmar is the publisher of the
Morning Searchlight and has recently be
gun the publication of Mineral Wealth of
Northern California in addition. Mrs.
Dittmar, who accompanies her husband,
has just completed Tier term as County
Superintendent of Schools of Shasta
County, and is enjoying a vacation after
four years of official life.
ASSESSMENT OF GOODS
IN BONDED WAREHOUSES
ALFRED C. PLATT TO BE AP
POINTED A DEPUTY ASSESSOR.
The Board of Supervisors at to-day's
meeting will begin a systematic attempt
to ascertain the value of the amount of
goods ...e local importers have in the
bonded warehouses. Chairman Phelps of
the Committee on Personal Property As
sessments will introduce a resolution re
questing the board to instruct Assessor
Dodge to appoint Alfred G. Platt as a
deputy assessor and in conjunction act as
advisory expert to the committee. This
has been precipitated by the statement
made to City and County Attorney Lane
by Collector Jackson that he had no par
ticular objection persona. Â«y to give out
the information about bonded goods, but
that he would be unable to do so since it
would be contrary to the regulations of
the Treasury Department. He further
stated that it was the first time in the
history of the Custom-house that such a
request had ever been made and he wouid
have to be guided by the authorities in
Washington. Mr. Lane has withdrawn
fr.iin the controversy, saying that he has
no desire- to pit himself against i..c Treas
ury Department.
When Mr. Platt, as a representative of
the Board of Supervisors, was detailed
some time ago to get information in or
der that goods now in the bonded ware
houses on which the duty was unpaid,
could be assessed by the board as per
sonal property, he was told by Collector
Jackson that no information could be
given in regard to one importer as against
another which would tend to benefit
either party. He took this stand by rea
son of Treasury decisions promulgated on
the subject. Platt reported to the Super
visors, who then delegated Mr. Lane to
got the information, with the above re
sult
It Is with the idea of clothing Platt with
the necessary authority that the resolu
tions will be introduced and the interest
ing point will be determined whether the
State or city and county has the power
to assess goods which are actually in the
sion of the Government, though in
reality owned by the importer and espe
in the case of goods on which the
cost, freight and insurance has been paid.
The point involved is whether the United
States Government can stand in the way
of the municipal authorities getting such
information as may be necessary for a
complete report of the assessment rolls.
It is certain that the matter will eventu
ally be decided in Washington, and as the
Hoard of Equalization meets on the first
Monday in July, an early decision is de
sired by the Supervisors.
Vast quantities of goods have hereto
fore escape taxation Decause they were
contained in bonded warehouses, and the
meift Committee takes the
stand that the State has a perfect right
to take steps to ascertain the owner
shir of the goods. By having a qualiiied
deputy assessor it will give him the right
to make the necessary Investigations.
He will then request to be shown the
withdrawal entries made after the first
day In March for the purpose of ascer
taining who is taking the goods out of the
warehouse and bo assess them accord
ingly.
The controversy will be watched with
considerable interest by the importers, as
much money is involved. They are de
termined to take the matter to the courts
should the decision be adverse to them
and the Supervisors be granted the right
to inspect the Government books in or
dt-r to assess the goods.

SPORT, SAYS
MRS. CLACK
She Also Denounces
the Baroness.
HER BOY IS INNOCENT
IS AT MANILA WITH THE
FIRST.
li Willie Is Guilty She Will
Adopt the Child and
Look After Its
Future.
The statement by Miss Audrey New
man, rirter of the Baroness yon Bun of
.Budapest, that Willie Clack is the father,
of her child, that was born in London at j
.â¢! public hospital on February 15, 1896J is j
stoutly denied by the Clack family of this i
city. Willie Clack is down at Manila, a '
private in Company E of the First Cali
fornia Volunteers, but his mother, Mrs.
Clack, states that she heard rumors over j
.â¢a .year, ago that Audrey Newman had )
claimed that her son was the father of the i
little girl hat is now over three years old. ;
: Mrs. Clack states that she immediately '
had a long talk with her son and asked
h'.m if the report were true, and that he j
stoutly denied the port.
Several young men, friends of Clack, |
were seen yesterday, and they state that
lie was no more attentive to Miss New
man than the rest of his companions and i
that the young lady was both fickle and j
fast, Willie Clack is the son of William
'.'iack, the owner of the Hayes Valley
Advertiser, who held the position of chief j
cleputy in the Sheriff's office under R. I.
Whelan until the first of the present year.
V.'iille helped his father In the newspaper
office until the war broke out, when he i
enlisted in Company E of the First Cali- j
fornia Volunteers and went to Manila.
Mrs. Clack made the folowing statement
at her residence, 102 liaight street, last
. night:
"I have seen In the papers the state
ment of Miss Audrey Newman that my
Willie is the fatner of her child, but I do
not believe her. Shu may have a sister
: lhat is Baroness on Buren, but that does j
- not make her any better. The Baroness !
.â herself is a San Francisco girl, and has
a very bad reputation, and as for this
Audrey, I have taken particular pains to
Investigate her charges, ad lind that my j
'X-oy is innocent of wronging her. The j
â¢whole family are a bad lot, and I have
nu patience with them. If I thought my j
boy had wronged this Miss Audrey New
man, sister of the Baroness yon Buren,
and that he was the father of the child, I
would not rest until 1 had sent for the
child and brought her over to this coun
, try and adopted it into my own family.
35ut lam ire the whole family are a bad !
1 lot. Why, only think, Willie is .ow Just I
21; and though he is no saint I am sure he !
would never think of doing this girl such
fi. cruel wrong as she claims he did. A !
lad; a frienv. of \> .*lie, dropped in to see ;
me to-night, and he said that he and all ,
the boys used to go out with Audrey and |
that â she was a very wild girl. I am sorry
that this thing should have sprung up.
Â£iut now that it is out and my boy is
â¢â¢â¢away lighting for his country. If I do not
denounce these impostors who will?"

CHRIST IS RISEN!
THE Easter festival was celebrated
throughout the land yesterday with
pomp and ceremony. In this city
the places of worship were crowded
to overflowing with Christians, who
attested that "Christ is risen."
The day opened threateningly, but be
fore the morning's services began the sun
shone brightly and the ladies were par
ticularly happy. What with the clusters
of Easter lilies, lilacs, roses, foliage and
palms that decorated the altars of all the
churches and the spring hats of the fair
worshipers, the austere surroundings of
the sacred edifices were not noticeable.
The musical programmes specially ar
ranged for the occasion by the various
choir leaders and the importance of the
celebration had a tendency to crowd all
the churches. As early as half-past 10
o'clock the congregations were in their
seats, and during the half-hour's wait for
the services to begin the time was con
sumed in observing decorations and cos
tumes.
Unlike their Eastern brethren, the men
did not dress for the occasion. Here and
there a silk hat and frock coat were seen,
but their presence was an exception to the
rule.
At the First Presbyterian the following
programme was rendered in its entirety:
Organ prelude (Guilmant); doxology; Creed;
Gloria by the choir; the Lord's Prayer; an
them, "Christ the Lord Is Risen" (Waud);
Scrlptpre reading; hymn No. 371, "Rise,
Glorious Conqueror, Rise"; solo, "Easter
Song" (Shepperd), Mrs. E. 8. Basford; prayer;
hymn No. 343, "The Head That Once Was
Crowned With Thorns"; offertory, "The
King of Glory" (Coombs), Dr. O. F. Graham;
sermon by the pastor; anthem, "Christ Our
Passover" (Lloyd); benediction; postlude,
"Easter March" (Merkel).
In the evening-: Organ prelude (Volkmar);
triumphal chorus, "Praise Ye the Father"
(Gounod); invocation: hymn No. 339, "All Hail
the Power of Jesus' Nome"; Scripture reading;
solo, "The Lord Victorious" (Ferrler), Mrs.
Rlpss; prayer; chorus, "Allelujah! Christ Is
Risen" (Shelley); hymn No. 361, "Crown His
Head With Endless Blessing"; organ solo,
offertory, in A flat (Batiste); offertory,
"The Resurrection" (Shelley). Mr. McÃride;
address by the pastor; chorus, "Christ the
Lori Is Risen Again" (Otto Fleissncr); bene
diction; organ postlude, "March" (Raff).
Hundreds of worshipers were turned

away from St. Mary's Cathedral before
the il o'clock mass. The immense edifice
was too small to contain the throng that
1 In hours before the time set for
the Important service of the day. The
ceremonies were impressive. At 11
o'clock the solemn pontifical mass was
celebrated by Archbishop Riordan. This
was followed by an eloquent sermon by
Rev. Father O'Byan and nt its conclu
sion the Archbishop conferred the papal
'ion.
-ing of the choir was a feature
of the services, the following numbers
being rendered: Beethoven's mans. "Ky
rle, "Gloria" and "Credo"; Hummel's
mass. "Sanctus," "Benedlrtus" and "Ag
nus Dei"; offertory, Giorza's "Regina
i Coell."
The choir was composed of the follow
; Ing well-known singers: Solo singersâ
Bopranoa, MiÂ«s Katherine Klaek, Mrs. Al
' fred Kelleher; altos. Miss Julia Sullivan,
Mrs. P. Steffani; tenors, David Manlloyd,

The decorations at St. Mary's and St.
! Ignatius Cathedrals were beautiful. At
! the latter place the decorations consisted
iof E:t.Â«t<;r lilies, pink and white I>a
, France roses, carnations, lilacs and
: palms.
The service* were grandly Impressive
! and were conducted by Rev. Father But
i ler and assistants. High mass was cele
brated at 10:30 o'clock, the sermon being

ard-street Methodist Church, the pastor.
Rev. Dr. John A. B. Wilson, preached
last night on "The Fact and Purpose of
the Resurrection," from Matthew
xxvili:6: "He Is not here, for he is risen,
as he said. Come, see the place where the
Lord lay," and said in part:
This is the message which greeted his dis
ciples from the shining lli>Â« of the heavenly
.it. Not here? No, he was here, but only
inplete the work of redemption, and now
is risen as he said. Not here? No. He was
here a moment ago to crush the head of the
old periÂ».tit and to throttle death In his lair;
to wrest from the tyrant of the jjrave the
precious life he thought his own. Not here?
No. lie was here, but in pursuit of a receipt
in full for the payment made for the world's
mption. Not here? No. He was here,
but to pluck the flowers of Immortality which
grew beyond the grave and twine them Into
wreathes for the crowning of his followers.
"He ia not here, he Is risen as he said." As
he said at the bier of the boy In pain when
he gave him again to his mother. As he saJd
at the grave of Lazarus, when he called him
forth in his winding phftjt and rommunded him
to be unbound. As he said when viewing the
beautiful structure of the temple and declared.
"Destroy this temple of my Dody and I will
raise it again in three days." No, he la not
here; he Is risen. Risen that the birds of the
gospel might fly to every land and to every
beleaguered ark on the Ararat of desolation
with the olive branch of peace and the ver
dure of immortality. Risen, that the hope of
palvution may possess the souls of the con
demned for sin. Risen, that the gates of the
heart and the doors of the understanding may
be lifted for the Ingress of the King of Glory.
"He is not here. He ia risen as he said.
Come, see the place where the Lord lay."
Yes, r;:-Ti to lead captivity captive and give
gifts unto men. Come, see the place where
tho Lord lay, and as you gaze note that he
hath left the angels of life and Immortality to
keep watch and ward o'er the dust of his
taints and to awaken them at the dawn of the
llrst resurrection. Come see the place where
the Lord lay, but know that with his exit from
the tomb the sting of death was extracted and
the victory o'er the grave accomplished. "The
sting of doath is sin, the strength of sin is the
law, thanks be unto God, who givoth us the
victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
The chapel at the Presidio was filled to
overflowing with soldiers and civilians to
attend the service conducted by Chaplain
Oliver C. Miller. The music, in charge
of Professor Otto Flelssner, with orches
tra and singers from the First Presby
terian Church, was appropriate and in
spiring.
Chaplain Miller made an earnest plea,
for the soldiers, and showed the necessity
of furnishing them with reading matter
and religious service. His text was from
! Mat hew 27-65: "Make it as sure as ye
ran." He said In substance: The Bible
â  is a book of battles; soldiers have always
been a necessity. Their service was es-
I sential in establishing the evidences of
the resurrection. The text was Pilate's
command to the soldiers guarding the
tomb of Jesus. Had they not been sta
tioned at the tomb there might have been
grounds for believing that his disciples
came and stole away his Body, and had
they not been stationed at the cross the
death of Christ might have been doubted.
We must first establish the fact of
Christ's death before we can prove his
resurrection from the dead. The soldier,
in obedience to orders not to let Jeesus
escape alive, pierced his heart with a
spear, and thus not only established the
truth of his death, but that he died of a
broken heart. It is a noteworthy fact
that the iirst confession of the divinity
of Christ after his crucifixion fell from
the lips of a soldier, the centurion In
charge of the guard, who said, "Truly
this is a righteous man and the Son of
God." We are Indebted to the service of
soldiers for the preservation of our Joy
ous Easter truth.
Atheism would strike out of our SKy i
any star of hope and put its seal upon
the tomb of Jesus, saying "make it as
6ure as you can." Pantheism with its
assertion that God is' nature and nature
is God, and Polytheism with Its gods
many and Deism With Its assertion that
there ie a God, but that "He has made no
mention of himselfâ all of these are
striving to seal the Repulcher of Jesus
and destroy the joyful truth of his res- |
urrection, but to no avail. They cannot j
satisfy the yearning soul; it escanes
from them as one suffocating flees for thÂ«
fresh air. Christ has broken the power
of the tomb, and they who believe in him
may look througli the grave at another
door into that larger life that awaits the
liberated soul and alone can satisfy Its
longing 1 . The power of the life to come
is the greatest of all inspirations. In it
all injustice will be banished and evil
qualities leveled, and the oppressed lib
erated and broken ties reunited forever, j
I.,ife this side of the resurrection is but 1
the lesser half of life's story and only a |
minor part of its song of joy. They who
by a living faith are savingly unitod with
Christ the ilret fruits of the resurrection
shall sit with him on the throne of his
glory.
"Easter Lilies, the Angels of the
Grass," was the subject of the sermon
delivered last evening at St. Mary's
Church (PauliPt) by Rrv. Father Mac-
Corry. He took his text fmm the eighth
chapter of St. Luke: "Consider the lilies
of the field." He Baid:
Christ says to us, "Consider the lilies of the
fleld." Let us measure them from petal to
root: let us listen to the message; let us breathe
their fragrance; let ua listen to the silvery
voices from their white tops. The lilies arÂ«
the angels of the grass, the evangels of the
skies. When the cataract speaks, It roars;
when the clouds speak, they thunder; when the
whirlwind speaks, it screams; but the lilies,
when they gpeak, Bpeak soft and sweet and
low. Then let us consider the lilies of the
fleld, not for the sake of sentimentality, hut
for the sake of Brand and holy and helpful
Christian application.
Father MacCorry proceeded to show how
God cared for the lilies and to draw the
conclusion that if his love so cherished
those flowers, it would also cherish and |
guard thoso made in his lm;ige. Continu
ing, the preacher painted several beauti
ful word pictures of floral associations at
the marriage altar and at the grave. He
said in conclusion:
The lilies of the field are the proofs of our
coming resurrection. That Is why we decorate
With them to-day; that Is why St. Paul will
not permit us to say the dead are burled. He
always tells us they are simply sown. Had 1
not Christ burst from the tomb to-day we
should not have risen from the grave. Be- ;
cause Christ has risen we shall arise glorious ;
and Immortal from our sleeping place. The j
cemetery Is simply a summer bower where
God's children sleep to awake In the glories of
that great Easter dawn, when Christ will come
up through the netted grass to the flowers and
will Bay, "Arise, arise, ye have slept so long
ye muEt be rested now."
Tli'' Bervlcc a at the Central Methonlst
Church on Mission street was unique in
this one particularâ that the crowd -who
attended tho morning service was solarge
as to fill every available inch of sitting
and standing room within the wallsâ so
great. Indeed, that the pulpit was taken
possession of barely leaving tho pastor
room In which to stand while delivering
his sermon. Even with this, several hn<l
to go away who could not find accommo
dation inside the doors.
The morning sermon was on "The
Empty Sepulcher," which the reverend
doctor portrayed to his congregation in
glowing colors and pathetic words. The
music, under the direction of J. J. Mor
rlÃ, was exceptionally artistic, and the
floral decorations were beautiful and elab- ;
orate. The feature of the decorations was
a huge cross composed entirely of calla
lilies.
Dr. Locke's sermon was an argument
for the resurrection of Jesus. He said In
part, taking his text from Matthew,
xxvlil:6:
The domes and battlements of the city nf
tiuth are all ablaze to-day with Easter glory!
All hail the Easter morn! Becnuse of the tri
umphs of that first Easter morning many dark
clouds have been rimmed with gold and lined
with pllver: many tears have glistened with
eternal hone, and life itself Is crowned with
Immortality.
The resurrection of Jesus Is essential to
Christianity. Looking back through the per
spective of nineteen hundred years, how do wa
know that Christ, Indeed, rose from the dead?
And how can we so confidently claim that the
sepulcher was empty that first Easter morning?
Greenleaf, the author of a lawbook on "Evi
dences," says "the argument for Christ's
resurrection is positively irrefutable."
The resurrection of Jesus was a fundamental
necessity In order to convince his disciples
who immediately went back to their nets, and I
H was neoe?a#ry to prove the divinity of Jesus, j
His resurrection was the master stroke of the i
Almighty to prove the deityship of Jesus Christ.
In his resurrection he became the keystone In
the massive arch which sustains the royal
highway between earth and heaven, over which
redeemed multitudes have thronged heaven
ward for nineteen centuries. Unbelief has done
Its worst, but has availed little in stopping the i
progress of the divine and risen Christ adown !
the years. The mythical and legendary theo
ries are ridiculous. A Christianity founded I
upon a myth or legend Is ten thousand times |
more wonderful and more difficult to believe ]
than a Christianity established upon a Christ j
who r'/ge from the dead. The burden of proof |
of the resurrection of Jesus is not with the 1
Christian. It Is f"r our enemies to prove that I
he did not rise. Christianity Is a mighty su
perstructure which rests upon the foundation
of Christ's resurrection. If you want an ar
gument for the resurrection look at the fruit
age of Christlanltv. Let unbelief account for |
all of these magnificent achievements with- j
out a risen Christ.
BÂ«hold how the risen Christ has healed hu
manity's wounds and assuaged humanity's sor
rows! The glory of an empty sepulcher floods
tho earth! A living Christ Is bringing all
things to life. The Christ spirit is gradually
transforming society, and the command "Bear
ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law
of Christ" will not cease Its application until j
the Christ love shall permeate all circles of so- \
clety, and all men will seek their own happl- j
nesÃ In the highest good of others. All hail the 1
power of Jesus' name! Let us crown Jesus
Christ Lord of all!

THE OTHER SIDE
OF ALAMEDA'S
SCHOOL FIGHT
Dr. Tisdale Replies to
B. C. Brown.
THE TELEPHONE INCIDENT
SOME DEPARTMENT SECRETS
MADE PUBLIC.
The School Director Scorches J. K.
Lynch and George Scott
of the Municipal
League.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park street, April 2.
Dr. C. L. Tisdale, member of c .Ma
meda Board of Education, who was made
famous by his celebrated telephone in
terview with Brainard C. Brown, replied
last night to the charges of corruption
made against him and other members of
the board by the school committee of the
Municipal I His address was
made at a meeting of the Non-Par
tisan party before one of the largest po
litical gatherings ever witnessed in this
city. The speaker was wildly cheered
throughout his ;>ddruss. In part he said:
I am here â¢ you that I am a candi
date for re-election to the Hoard of Educa
tion. You may have heardâ by telephone per
haps- hat I am a candidate. I have
Eerved in that position for the last eight years
and I am not ashamed i ! any act that I have
performed during that period. I have lived in
this city for fourteen years, and never before
has any man or any party or any organizat'.<: - ;
of a political or other character dared to vil
ify or throw mud upon the candidate! of a
rival organization. It Is the first time, fellow -
citizens, that this kind of a fight has ever been
made. Alameda has been the pride of her
citizens She has pat here upon the peninsula,
occupying a proud and lofty position. She ha.Â»
said other town have crooked officials,
towns have had municipal scandals, other
towns have had (iisriyreements In their body
politic, but we, the city of Alameda, have
never had men hi office of whom we were
ashamed. We have made that statement an 1
we have believed it. and in believing it we
have brought here thousands of the best people
of California t> build their homes in our midst.
Thpy have come here because they believed
that Alani(da was pure. They have come here
-.- they believed its municipal government
was clean. Fellow-citizens, if the sort of fight
that was begun lately is kept up, Alameda
will receive a black eye from which It will
take her years to recover.
The speaker paid a tribute to the high
character of the opposing candidates, and
stated that they were not responsible for
the Inauguration of the "mud-slinging
campaign." He said that there had never
been a scandal in the Alameda School
Department, and that its financial affairs
had been conducted la a strictly honest
manner, and that its supplies had been
purchased at closer prices than by any
other city In the State. Getting down
to the authors of the attack upon him
Dr. Tisdale paid his respects to J. K.
Lynch, George A. Scott and Brainard C.
Brown, the Municipal League committee,
in the following style:
â  The next charge that has been made against
the present management of the Board of
Education Is that the schools are overcrowded.
UÂ» know It. Whose fault Is it? The critical
gentlemen of the Municipal League say It is
the fault of the . .rd of Education.
Gentlemen, our record in that direction Is a
matter of public knowledge. Six years apo
the citizens of Alameda voted for bonds to
erect a primary an' 1 , grammar school. The
City Trusters purchased a lot and paid $700 de
posit on it. One of the triumvirate whose name
is signed to the attack upon the Board of Edu
ls Mr. James K. Lynch of Sherman
street. Mr. James K. Lynch, you will remem
ber, is the man who served an Injunction upon
the cltv of Alameda, and so prevtntei the
building of the primary grammar school at
that time. Fellow-citizens, If we hai that
t-chool to-day there would be no coafteyiion in
this detriment. This Is the same Jamer K.
Lynch who selfishly said that no school
should he built in his neighborhood, the same
man who Is reported to have said that noschool
children should pass by his house, the game
James K. Lynch who caused the city to lose
the J7M deposit that 1t put up on the lot,
the same James K. Lynch who. trusting to the
ehort memory of his fellow-citizens, has now
. decided to cast the. blame for his own Belfigh
the Board of Education of this city.
(Applause.)
Another member of this triumvirate, who
thes-^ attacks upon Mr. Lanktree and
myself, le George W. Scott, the anxious father
of a School Director. He has signed this state
ment. He has charged that a ring controls
the department In this city; that Mr Lanktree.
Mr. Brown and myself have captured all the
â committees of any value In the department,
leaving his son to the solitary grandeur of the
presidential fhair. (Laughter, i How was this
position obtained? Dr. Scott agreed to appoint
us if we would vote for him that he might be
come president and so satisfy his own ambi
tion and that of his father, who. until out
raifd public opinion became too strong, occu
the undignified position of member of a
â¢committee which was publicly vilifying and
inrulting his Fons colleagues on the board. It
our record in the preceding years had been so
very bad, why did these gentlemen return us
to thos.- i.nsitions of alleged Importance? I
have told you.
Referring to Bralnard C. Brown, with
whom he had the telephone interview,
the speaker said:
The third member of the triumvirate, to
whose venomous pen is due the series of pollt
. leal classics that have disgusted this commu- i
nity during the present campaign, pays the
enormous sum of 52 l-3c per annum toward the
â¢ School fund of this city. No wonder that he
guards with a Jealous eye the expenditure of
this munificent amount and feels anxious for
â  fear it may he misapplied. (Applause.) For
months this person has been maliciously and
â¢ falsely attacking me on every occasion. Be
lieving that he was misinformed; believing that
he was honorable enough to desist from these
attacks when told the facts. I called upon the
gentleman at his office in San Francisco and
talked the situation over with him freely. I
â¢ said to him, "Too have made these charges
against me. Do you know that they are true?"
He replied, "I do not. Some one told me so.
I am opposed to you and have got to beat you."
.We talked the matter over. I explained it to
him In a fair, square manner, as one man
talking to another, the exact truth as to every
: one of these assertions that had been made
against me. I Invited him to come to my
office, to look at my books and see the enor
â¢ mous amount of money that I had made out of
the School Department during the period I have
been In it. I asked him to come and see that
: In fifteen months past I had made exactly $18
â¢ out â¢'. the School Department of Alameda,

Shared Honors Equally With
the Calla.
OAKXANTP, April 2.â Joyous music
[Specially arranp'rt, beautiful yet modest
decorations in which the California pop
py shared honors equally with the calla
..lily, and interesting sermons apropos of
Easter, were the special features at most
,of the local churches to-day. A? for the
attendance, it stronfjly recalled Mr.
Moorly's declaration that the people of
California arc growing in Christiantiy,
â for the churches were filled to their ut
most capacity with audiences in Easter
ettirr.
At St. Paul's Episcopal Church the
evening prayer and song service was par

ter praise service, choral and orches
tral, in the evening, and this morning
Rev. Dr. E. R. Dille spoke upon "The
Dead and the Living Christ."
â¢"The Resurrection" was the topic of

appropriate to the Easter festival occu
pied the greater part of the evening.
At the First Congregational Church
Rev. C. R. Brown spoke to-day on The
Resurrection Foretold by Moses, with
special praise service to-night.

A FALLING LILY
SPOILED SERVICES
CREATED CONSTERNATION AT
THE METHODIST CHURCH.
Alameda Office San Francisco Call,
1428 Park Street, April 2.
Easter services at the First M. E.
Church were rudely interrupted this
morning by an unfeeling calla lily that
fell from a cross high above the pulpit
and struck the minister, Rev. E. P. Den
nett, squarely on top of the head. The
occurrence happened during one of the
most solemn portions of the ceremonies,
but it made such a humorous impression
on the congregation that thoir feelings
overcame them and every member gave
forth a loud laugh.
E. T. M. Eckert was in the midst of an
impressive barytone solo when the mem
bers of the congregation were attracted
by a movement on the calla lily cross,
followed by one of the lilies falling from
its place and swinging gently to and fro
by a white thread that had bound It to
the skeleton of the cross. The lily did not
ttart en its downward flight until Mr.
Eckert had finished his solo and Rev. Mr.
Dennett had stepped up to the pulpit to
.'..liver his Easter sermon. The min
ister had just given voice to the first
words of his address when the lily let go.
Its course for the reverend gentleman's
head was as straight and true as a shot
from one of Dewey's puns. It sailed
through the air like a parachute. The
stamen struck the preacher upon the
crown, scattering the yellow pollen
through his hair. This, with the color
the incident brought to his face, gave his
head the appearance of a beautifully col
iaster egg.
Rev. Mr. IVnnett hid his face behind
a handkerchief, but his embarrassment
was complete when a gentle titter, which
finally developed into an outburst of
mirth, arose from the pews. It was some
minutes before the congregation and the
minister regained their composure. They
could not arise to the solemnity of the
lion, however, and the services were
cut short.
Yesterday's Handball Sport.
It was a warm day at Phil Ryan's hand
ball court. 85S Howard street, yesterday.
There were eleven good games played,
with some of the crack performers be
fore the walls. Jim Xealon redeemed
himself for the Indifference shown at last
Sunday's play. He was in fine trim and
his manner of sending out sidewall deads
puzzled his most active opponents. In
fact, he walked away with the honors of
the court. Professor Riordon was in
good condition also, but he lacked the
sending home of shorts by which he has
heretofore distinguished his inside play.

Arrest of a Hard Gang.
Detectives Fitzgerald and Graham and
Policemen Callaghan, Connell, Bolton
and Brown raided a cabin at the corner
of Fourteenth avenue and H street last
night and arrested Cornelius Callahan. a
prize-fighter: Al Smith, alias "Hoop"
Smith; James Condrin, alias "Jimmy the
"Whale," and John Wilson. Wilson re
sisted, but was finally subdued and tne
gang was taken to the Seventeenth-street
station pending investigation.
The prisoners are suspected of having
committed a dozen burglaries in the Mis
sion. They have robbed h_en roosts and
committed other depredations. It is
thought that these are the men who en
tered a house on Fourteenth avenue, and
alter wrecking the place carried away
everything portable in an express
wagon.
Scientific men generally believe that the
bed of the Pacific Ocean was once above
water and inhabited by men.

A BARBAROUS
FATHER APES
BRANDES' ACTS
Charles H. Fay Lands
in Jail.
ENRAGED AT A PETTY THEFT
THRASHED HIS DAUGHTER
BLACiv. AND JBLUE.
The Merciless Man in His Rage Bare
ly Spared the Life of His Thir
teen- /ear-Old Child,
Laura.
i
BERKELEY, April 2.â The university
town has hardly rid itself of one in
human child-beater before another has
come upon the scene. Yesterday morning
Brandes, the notorious, was convicted of
murder in the second degree for beating
his child to death. Hardly had the news
of the jury's verdict spread to West
Berkeley ere there was enacted in a
small c-ottage back of the Hoffburg
brewery a crime of similar nature, a most
aggravated and fiendish thrashing of a
helpless young girl. Save for the fact
that the outcome did not amount to act
ual murder the main particulars of the
revolting incident resemble almost detail
for detail the shocking treatment meted
out to the unfortunate Lillian Brandes.
The perpetrator of the crime is Charles
11. Fay. He is now behind the bars of the
Alameda County Jail.
Fay's house stands opposite Curtis
street in West Berkeley, between Univer
sity avenue and AddiÃon street. He is
said to be a shiftless character, unwilling
to work, and forcing the entire support
of his family upon his wife. Among his
neighbors he is known as a heavy drink
er and his family surfers frequently from
his whisky-inflamed anger.
It was during one of these drunken,
rages that he returned home yesterday
evening. His daughter, Laura, a bright,
intelligent girl of 13, was in the house.
Without provocation apparently he ac
cused her of having Btolen a piece of
cake. She pleaded innocence. Making
violent threats of killing her the father
took what must have been a heavy trunk
strap, old and hard. With this, doubled
and knotted, he dealt blow after blow
upon the helpless child till she fell to the
ground, dazed with the shock and pain.
The beating covered all parts of the body,
from the heal and shoulders down to the
Instep. Not an inch was spared upun
which the cruel strap * I i Â« I not fall. Again
and again the instrument of torture came
down upon the unfortunate victim till
the Insatiate parent became weary of his
efforts.
Picking up the body he flung it Into
an unoccupied room, vowing to carry out
his murderous threat later. The girl, left
to herself upon the floor, revived slowly,
and finding herself able to crawl made
her way by degrees to the window,
through which she managed to escape.
Fortunately neither of her parents dis
covered her absence and as fast as the
bruised condition of her body would al
low made her way to a friend's house in
South Berkeley.
The matter was taken to Marshal
Lloyd, who kept the girl at his house over
night. The full extent of the brutal beat
ing was not seen until this morning,
when she complained of severe pains in
her back and limbs.
Several bruises on the skull first at
tracted the attention of the police. Fur
ther examination revealed the whole
story.
The body of Lillian Brandes, maltreat
ed almost beyond recognition, was not
worse than that of Laura Fay. From
shoulder to hips and thence downward
the flesh was a mass of blue and purple
ridges.
Marsha] Llr>yd, in company with Dep
uty Marshal Rawson, at once decided to
place the father under arrest. They
found him in an intoxicated state search-
Ing for the child. When questioned by
the Marshal as to his treatment of the
girl he repeated the charge of her hav
ing stolen the cake. His wife told the
same story.
She admitted later, however, that her
husband was in the habit of beating both
herself and the Kirl continually.
Marsha! Lloyd took the inhuman man
to the County Jail this afternoon. He
will have to answer a charge of excessive
cruelty to children. Laura Fay is known
among her friends as a bright, intelli
gent girl, modest and well behaved.
MURDERER BRANDES' EASTER.
OAKLAND. April 2.â William A.
Brandes. who was convicted yesterday of
the murder of his daughter, spent a
giooni) toaster day. There wore no visit
ors t<j Bee him, except tho Salvation Army
and Captain White's Christian party, who
conducted brief services of prayer and
song, but Brandes showed little or no In
terest in the fact of Easter, and remained
in his cell the greater part of the day.
Nor did the advent of a new prisoner,
Charles Fay. charged with brutally beat
ing hi? little daughter at Berkeley to-day
seem to create company for his misery'
Tuppin, the man charged with felony em'
bezzlement, was brought a largo bouquet
of calla lilies by his wife, hut even these
kindly reminders performed no soothing
function for Murderer Brandes, who ap
peared sullen and gloomy.
Rose Leclerq Dead.
LONDON. April 2.â Miss Rose Leclerq,
a well-known actress, is dead.
"HOLY MOSES"
IS WANTED BY
THE POLICE
An Old Hand Swindled
Banker Jewett.
HE IS A CLEVER SCHEMER
SOLD MANY BIBLES UNDER
FALSE PRETENSES.
He Induced Saloon-Keepers to Think
They Needed Them in Their
Business and Made a
Clean-Up.
The identity of the man who sold the
last "gold brick" to Banker John H. Jew
ett has been fully established. He Is not
the unknown for which he would pass
under the name of E. N. Baker, but a
confidence operator who would be willing
to lose a nickname by which he is known
all over the country. That nickname in
all the rogues' galleries in the West is
"Holy Moses" Baker, and the law is fair
ly Itching for a good grip of its slippery
possessor.
Baker earned the prefix "Holy Moses"
and considerable incidental coin by a
clever swindle he worked a dozen years
ago. At that time he was a temporary
resident of Albuquerque, N. Mex., un
known to fame or the police. He wanted
coin, but lacked the energy to work for
it, so put in his spare hours in the New
Mexican town thinking out some plan to
get "easy money." At last he hit upon
the idea, since so commonly pul In prac
tice, of using the mails to catch victims
by wholesale. In contradistinction, how
ever, to the methods since pursued by his
imitators. Baker's plan was novel. He
was; an artist in his line. The ordinary
"sucker" was not to his taste. He pro
posed to go after people who were sup
posed to know It all, so that in after
years, while enjoying their coin, he could
gloat on the artistic fishing he had done
to land them.
Baker warned "wise" people, and after
events approved his judgment. From Al
buquerque he sent out circulars to saloon
keepers, cigar-store proprietors and well
known men about the cities and towns of
the West. He had a plan, his circulars
stated, whereby he could furnish them
with the rat lest book in the language,
one that Uncle Sam could nut keep out of I
the mails, and one that the lucky buyers !
could exhibit openly In their places of 'â 
business for the delectation of their :
friends. It was a great money-maker, he !
said, and could be had from him fur $i 'â 
cash, stamps or money order.
lluw many "wise" people bit will never j
be known, but there were thousands, i
judging from the mail BaV-r received at
Albuquerque. So many were the letters
addressed to him that the postal authori
ties became suspicious and began an in
vestigation. They found that Baker had
been sending to his various correspond
ents for the price named Bibles that could
be bought for a song. In each book he
had put a slip of paper, reading:
"The choicest chapters are from Gene
sis to the journey of Moses to the prom
ised land."
There was no way to prosecute Baker,
apparently, but he was requested to move
on and he moved. Letters addressed to I
him at Albuquerque were held up and re- j
turned to their senders, who were inform- i
ed by the Postofflce Department of the I
nature of the swindle practiced against
them.
Since that time Baker, who had earned
the name of "Holy Moses," tried all sorts
of schemes through the West. Latterly he
has worked the write-up scheme, and In
many other cases besides that of Jewett
apparently with success. His partner in
that swindle and in many others is one
A. H. H-ansen, who does the "rough
work." ____________
PROFESSOR ANTHONY ARRIVES. '
111-Fated Crew of the Stella Erland
Returns on the Curacao.
The Pacific Steamship Curacao arrived
yesterday and docked at the Broadway
wharf at 7 o'clock last evening. Aboard '
were Professor Anthony and the crew of
the schooner Stella Krlnnd, which went
ashore thirty miles north of Magdalena
Bay on the night of March IS. The eight i
men of the crew were as follows: 11 B.
Reading, it. c. MacGregor, K. n. Beck,
Arthur Whitlock, James N. Gaylord, i
George Bpencer, Chase Littlejohn and
Charles Jones. All hands have hard hick
tales to tell of their experience. When
they landed on the beach after the wreck
they pitched tents made of tattered sails
and lived in comparative comfort until
the custom officers at Magdalena seized j
their provisions. They were then re
quired to subsist on food which they
claim w;ih good enough for uncivilized,
people but hard on the stomachs of white
men.
None of the cargo of the Stella Erland
was recovered. The accident was due
principally to currents which drove the
vessel twenty miles inward before its
course could be readjusted. Captain An
thony has already made formal protest
to the American Consul at P'nsenada.
THE BIG SHOOT.
A. Strecker Retains the Crown of
Champion.
President Philn Jacoby mounted a table
at Schuotze-n Park yesterday and with a
gpn ad-eagl< Bwoop of hla arms announced
that the great annual Schuetzemeet of the
California Sehuetzen Club had begun.
"With loud cheering the large number of
marksmen present made a rush for the
Bhooting stands, rifles came to shoulders
and soon the merry popping heralded the
inauguration of a contest in which a
goodly number of sharpshooters added to
their fame and the contents of, their
pockets.
Shooting began at 9:30 o'clock In the
morning, and the last rifle cracked at 6
in the evening. Delegations were present
as guests from the Sacramento 1. fie Club
and the Ontervllle Rifle Club of Alameda
County, and at least one man in each of
these visiting organizations made a record
he need not be ashamed to mention.
No official scores have yet been mado
out, but individual computation shows
that Adolph Strecker, the Post-street
"Sycamore." has again shown himself to
be the "noblest Roman of them all" when
it comes to pointing a gun at a lullseye.
There were two targetsâ the ring and the
honoraryâ three shots being permitted at
the latter and four at the former. On the
honorary target Strecker's score was
72, 72, 70, 69. This entitles him to first
prize, a choice between a silver dinner
set and a target rifle valued at $65, do
nated by the Winchester Repeating Arms
Company. Besides, he will receive a
champion silver goblet from A. L. Ott.
On the ring target Striker's score was
93, 91, 90, 89, which places him near the
head of the list in that competition and
will bring him a cash prize of $20. The
performance of the veteran marksman
was the more remarkable on account of
the fact that in all he shot away only
ten tickets, and if he had desired to make
himself "too conspicuous," as he himself
expressed it, he might have taken first
prize on the ring target.
Closely following Streoker came F P
Schuster, who won first prize on the ring
target with a top score of 95, which
drew down the first prize of }30. Schuster
also made a top score of 71 on the honor
ary target and will receive a valuable
prize for that performance as well
Jacob Meyer, the "father of the Sacra
mento Rifle Team," came second on the
list on contestants at the honorary target
â coring 72. 71, 70 and 69. This was very
close to Strecker's record. D. B. Faktor
came in for third place on the same tar
get with a top score of 72. backed by a
second of 71. The other members of the
Sacramento Club and their scores were:
A. MHstor, 62: J. Gruhk-r, 71; E. Schmid
71; and F. Ruhstaller, 67.
On the public or ring target Dr. Rogers
and John Utschig Sr. vied for second
place, each scoring 94. Only the official
computation will tell which won. Scores
of 93, in addition to that of Strecker. were
made by C. J. Walden and O. Bremen A.
H. Pane made 92.
C. F. Homer of the Centervllle Club
made the phenomenal score of 69 on the
honorary target with an ordinary Win
â¢hester rifle, using open sights. With the
<ame rifle he scored 73 on the ring or pub
ic target. The other members of the
'enterville Club and their score follow:
K. D. Blacow. 59; C. W. Risen, 51. R. E.
-^mith of the same team did not shoot.
I'hllo Jacoby. in spite of the fact he
md T. J. Carroll were busily engaged in
-eeing that everything ran smoothly all
lay. found time to take a hand in the con
:est and won the' plaudits of his fellow
members by scoring 06 on the honorary
target in 20-23-23 time. Philo is a lively
men in spite of his age and takes a
back seat in shooting for nobody.
1 up principal prize scores on the honor
ary target were as follows:
A. Strecker 72. J. Meyer 72. D. B. Faktor
72. Fred Kuhnle 72. J. Utschig Sr. 71, C.
Thierbaoh 71, F. P. Schuster 71. A. H.

Waller 65, Judge Bahrs 64. E. H. Goetz 63,
J. D. Heise 63, R. Langer 62, W. Ehren
pfort 62.
On the ring or public target the follow
ing were the principal prize-drawing
scores:
F. P. Schuster 95, Dr. Rogers 94, J. Ut
schig Sr. 94. A. Strecker 93. O. Eremer 93,
C. J. Walden 93, A. H. Pape 92. D. B. Fak
tor 91, E. Schmid 91, R. Finking 91, J.
Gruhler 90, A. Breuss 90, Captain Attinger
90, J. Jones 90.
Cash prizes were won in addition as fol
lows: J. C. Walter, for first bullseye In
the morning; D. B. Faktor, for first 25 in
the morning; C. Thir-rhach. for last bulls
eye in the morning, and F. P. Schuster,
for the first bullseye in the afternoon.
The California Schuetzen Clv will hold a
social next Thursday evening at Eintracht
Hall, on the corner of Twelfth and Fol
som streets, at which the official scores
will be made public and the prizes distrib
uted.
To-morrow, beginning at 9 o'clock,
Strecker and F. E. Mason will hold a
A. STRECKER.
match shoot of 150 shots at Schuetzen
lark for a money stake. The match is to
determine the relative merits of a Win
chester target rifle and a Winchester-Pope
target rille. Strecker uses the old gun,
but, if he loses the match, has agreed to
buy and use hereafter a Winchester-Pope.
He says that he has used his gun for nine
years and shot it 30,000 times, and if he
wins the match will use the same gun "as
long as he is able to peep over a sight."
Women's Relief Corps Home.
Yesterday Department Commander Sol
Cahen, accompanied by T. C. Masteller,
J. H. Simpson and F. E. Myers, members
of his Ht;iff, paid an official visit of inspec
tion to the Home for Destitute Female
Members of Old Soldiers, which was
erected In 18S9 by the Woman's Relief
Corps of the Grand Army of the Republic
at Evergreen, Santa Clara County.
The party was met by C. Mason Kinne
of the advisory board and Mrs. E. d A.
Kinne, the treasurer of the home. Under
the guidance of Mrs. Geraldine E. Fris
bie, president of Ok- home, and Mrs. Cora
A. Merriti ami .Mrs. Masteller of the
board of managers, a thorough Inspection
of the premises was made and everything
was found to be in perfect condition. The
six acres surrounding the place are under
a high state of cultivation, and the fruit
trees, some three hundred in all, promise
to yield a splendid crop. At least two
acr< B are planted in vegetables, which
will produce more than sufficient for the
use of the home, which at the present
time has room for about twenty more ln
mates.
The management of Mrs. Frisbie has
mad* 1 the home nil that it was ever in
tended to be. Members of the home
universally express satisfaction with their
treatment and say that it is "an Ideal
home in an Ideal spot." Although this
home has been open for nearly ten years,
the entire furnishings, except possibly the
carpets, are quite as good as when
originally purchased. There is not a dol
lar of debt against the institution, which
speaks well for the management. It la
an institution of which the loyal women
and comrades of the Grand Army may
well be proud.

C. P. HUNTINGTON
ARRIVES IN TOWN
Says People Must Pay
Central Pacific Debt.
Declares He Will Oppose Any
Compromise With Railroad
Commissioners.
C. P. HUNTINGTON SAYS THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA, AND
NOT THE CENTRAL PACIFIC, MUST PAY THE LATTER' S ENOR
MOUS DEBT TO THE GOVERNMENT. HE SAYS HIS FAILURE TO
INDUCE THE GOVERNMENT TO GRANT A LONG EXTENSION OF
TIME FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE DEBT WILL PREVENT ANY CON
TEMPLATED REDUCTION OF RATES. MR. HUNTINGTON DE
CLARES HE DOES NOT FAVOR A COMPROMISE WITH THE RAIL
ROAD COMMISSION IN THE PENDING SUIT FOR A REDUCTION IN
GRAIN RATES BY THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC AND THAT HE WILL
OPPOSE ANY SUCH COMPROMISE.
Collis P. Huntingdon, president of the
Southern- Pacific Railroad, arrived in
San Francisco last evening and is now
domiciled In the big wl.ite mansion on
Nob Hill, which he will occupy until
his departure, for the East, on or about
May 1. Mr. Huntingdon's special train,
consisting of three vestibuled cars, ar
rived at the Oakland mole at 6:45. The
magnate, accompanied by Mrs. Hunt
ington, H. E. Huntington and the other
members of the party, which included
ten or a dozen servants, immediately
boarded the ferry and reached this side
of the bay at 7:15. Vice President
Btubbs and Passenger Traffic Manager
McCormick joined th: party on the
Alameda shore, and General Manager
Julius Kruttschnitt, together with half
a' score of railroad officials and at
taches, were waiting to greet their
chief in the ferry depot at the foot of
Market street.
The railroad magnate looked strong
and hearty as he walked from the ferry
to the cable car, exchanging cordial
greetings with friends and acquaint
ances as he passed along, but he con
fessed to feeling somewhat tired. He
declined to ride to his California street
residence in a carriage, however, and
the entire party democratically rode up
the hill in a street car. like ordinary
mortals.
â¢ Mr. Huntington's visit to San Fran
, cisco and the coast at this time is for
the purpose of attending the annual
election of the Southern Pacific and to
Straighten out a few kinks in th work
ings of the big system, political or oth
erwise, of which he is the head. . Mr.
Huntington was averse to being inter
viewed, but in response to certain
questions propounded by a representa
tive of The Call he dictated the follow
ing:
You ask what will be the effect on
â¢ California business of the reorgani
zation of the Central Pacific, to
which 1 would reply that I hope
and believe it will be beneficial.
As to rates and improvements
of road, we expect that the facili
ties will be somewhat improved,
which will naturally accelerate
â¢ the movement of tonnage. But I
do not know whether the rates
can be cut down. â¢
I had strongly hoped that we
could make an arrangement with
the Government for a long exten
sion of the time of the repayment
of the money loaned to the com
pany, which, while it would give
back to the Government all its
money, dollar for dollar, "with a
fair rate of interest currently, and
thus not cause any loss whatever
to the people of the whole coun
try, would at the same time
spread these payments over three
generations, and thus make it
easier for the present one. 'â¢
For it is from the patrons or the
road, largely Californlans, tnat
i the money must in reality come,
as the road has no other means of
earning it. But a small, though
turbulent, portion of the people of
California, at least so far as they
may have been represented by the
city press, seemed to desire that
the whole of the debt shall be
paid by this generation.
Which will, of course, prevent a
decrease of the rales to what they
would have been if the extension
asked for had been allowed. And
I feel confident that there would
have been no difficulty in secur
ing this extension had it not been
for the opposition coming from
the element in California to which
I have referred.
As to what wo propose to effect
by the purchase or consolidation
with the Southern Company
of lines in California that are at
present leased to the parent organ
ization, I have to say that
it is a matter vâ > have not
yet fully decided upon, and
cannot until we have fully dis
cussed the matter in all its bear
ings. Consolidations or joint own
erships lessen very much the ex
pense of transportation, so that
the things that we do will be those
â which we believe will allow us to
do the business at the least possi
ble charge consistent with an effi
cient service, as that will benefit
not only the people, hut the rail
road company.
You ask what is the significance
â¢ of Mrs. Stanford's sale of Central
Pacific stock, to which 'I would re
ply that it will make no difference.
Early in the 'Ma the other three in-'
terests sold a large portion of their
stock, at a time of great stringency
in the money market, .in order to
raise money, and it made no par
ticular difference in the manage-
ment of the road. And 1 do not
BUppose Mrs. Stanford's selling or
keeping: her stork will make any
particular difference.
As to beginning work between
Han Fram Isco and San Mateo. on
the hay shore line, I cannot answer
at the moment, as it is one of those
thing's which art- to be discuss* '1
by the directors of the company in
San Francisco, and no doubt what
they decide upon or d<> will be for
the best Interests of the company,
with, of course, due regard to the
convenience of the public.
Concerning the coast line, I
would say in reply, that we expect
to have it done in about twelve
months, though it is difficult to
give the exact time at the moment,
as we shall build a first-class road,
and it takes time to do good work.
You ask if I favor compromise
of suit with Railroad Commis
sion. That is a matter largely
with our legal department,
though, as for myself. I shall op
pose any compromise which gives
the right to any tribunal to re
duce the rates of fares and
freights so long as they are
not above what will give a fair
return for the money invested in
creating these properties.
Certainly, the right to regulate
fares and freights without regard
to the cost of the property or the
income from it would carry also
the right to confiscate the property
itself, a thing I am satisfied will
never be upheld by the judicial
arm of the Government. At the
same time, let me say that the
Railroad Commission might do
much good as regulators, as you
may say. between the agrarian
or communistic element of our peo
ple and the conservative Interests
of the better classes.
Mr. Huntington declined to discuss
the signiti â¢ < the law enacted by
the Legislature authorizing the ex
change of privileges by the Santa Fe
and Southern Pacific, and he could not
say what arrangements had been,
would be or would not be entered into
DR. STEBBINS WELCOMED

NOTED NOVELIST HERE.
Author of "Thou Shalt Not" Writing
Another Book.
L. B. Porter, whose norn de plume is
"Albert Ross," arrived at the Palace on
the overland last evening. The novel
which made Mr. Porter famous is "Thou
Shalt Not," of which over 2'V>.ooo copies
have in â¢ n sold. There has been the enor- i
mous total >>i" 1,600,000 copies of all his ;
novels sold.
"Thou Shalt Not," said Mr. Porter
in an interview, "was my first attempt at
novel writing and I have since continued
to write at the rate of two books a yeav

engaged on a new novel to he named "The j
Naked Truth,' which will tell of the strug- i
gle undergone by a girl in making her
way through the world. She first sees
the light of day in Colorado and tells her
story to a friend at the Hotel del Coron
ttdo. There will be a brief description of
Ban Francisco in the tale, which will hay*
a slight California flavor. I have gath

California life and I hope to utilize It in

ROBBED A SAILOR.
Serious Charge Against J. S. Kenney,
a Boy in His Teens.
Thomas Smith, a sailor on the training
ship Pensacola, was rolling along Market
street, between Fourth and Fifth', early
: lay morning, when he met J. S.
Kenney, a boy 19 years of agf. and a
inion. They accosted Smith, and he
alleges that Kenney put his hand in his
pocket and Btole a & gold piece. Smith
accused him of taking 1 the money, and
was knocked down.
Smith yelled for the police, and Officers
T. F. Burke and C. E. Fennell responded.
After a hot chase they captured Kenney,
but his companion escaped. Kenney was
taken to the City Prison, wh'rc a charge
of robbery was booked against him.
AFTER GOLD IN
DINES SOUTH
OF THE PARK
Two Well - Known Commission
Men Said to Have Made a
Big Discovery.
John F. English and P. F. Zammitt Refuse
to Go Into Particulars Concerning
Mining Operations in Sun
set District.
RUMORB have be<>n persistently cir
culated for several days past that a
new Klondike was about to he open
ed up in the Sunset district. John
F. English, a well-known commission
merchant at Clay and Davis streets, was
said to he the lucky owner of the land
upon which the polden stream had been
tapped, and \'. V. Zammitt, an equally
well-known poultry dealer, wa.s said to
have made the discovery.
Zammitt has been working In the sand
dunes in the block bounded by Thirtieth
and Thirty-first avenues and X and L
streets for some time past, sinking;, Kng
lish pays, a well for the purpose Of sup
plying: with water a chicken ranch which
the two men propose to start there. In
making the well Zammitt has uncovered
dirt that led him to believe that lie was
boring into a bonanza, and in that belief
he has paid a number of visits to the Sel
by Smelting Works with samples of his
rind. The assay value of these samples
has not been high, 65 cents a ton being,
bo tar. the most that has been taken out
of any one lot of the material found in
the well hole, but whether or not Eng
lish and Zammitt have a bonanza it is
to be gathered from their actions and
speech that they desire secrecy for a few
days at least for what they do believe.
Th.c rock containing the gold found by
the assayers Is sni<l to be a quartz con
taining BUlphurets of iron, platinum and
mica with gold. This gold, although Mr.
English denies it and Mr. Zammitt does
not feel that he can give out any informa
tion about it. is said to run from $4 tn
$12 to the ton Of rock. It is reported to
have been discovered In a ledge only
three feet below the surface, with a
breadth of four feet.
The unwillingness of Mr. English and
Mr. Zammltt to talk about the retorted
find is said not to arise from any coyness
at their pood fortune, bui for the reason
that they desire to pet options on sur
rounding land at the prevailing rates for
sand dune, in the hope thai the adjoin
ing territory may add to the fortune that
A FATHER DEAD IN
A HOUSE OF POVERTY
FOUR STARVING BABES AROUND
HIS BIER.
W. C. Smith Died Saturday, but Has
Not Yet Been Buried for Lack
of Funds.
A father lying dead on an improvised
bier in a house of poverty; four hungry
and ragged children clinging to a heart
broken mother, and an empty, dusty cup
board, form a pitiful scene of destitution
at 1424 Broadway. The case has lately
been given attention by Mrs. Harring
ton of the Children's Hospital, and she
', provided medical attendance for the un
; fortunate man In the last hours of his
life, hut now, according to the statement
of the mother, the charitable societies
! have ceased to act, and the wn
j family finds itself confronted with the
i problem of burying its dead without
i funds.
William H. Smith died early Saturday
morning;. In life he was a painter, and
made a scant existence by taking odd
jobs. Two weeks ago he was stricken
with pneumonia, and. with his illness, the
family income stopped. The children
were on the verge or starvation and the
man Flowly dying for want of attend
ance. Mrs. Harrington heard of the case
and with the assistance of charitable
neighbors made his last hours as com
fortable as possible. After her husband
died Mrs. Smith appealed to charitable
institutions and societies to bury the
body, as she was absolutely without a
cent of money. None of them responded.
An undertaker visited the place yester
day, but when he realized the situation
he refused to take the case. Yesterday
afternoon Officer Lyons, whose beat is
in the vicinity, notified the health offi
cials and the Central Police station of
the matter, and the remains, which are
already in an advanced state of decom
position, will be consigned to the potter's
field to-day unless some one tenders the
widow funeral expenses.
The hungry, helpless children are aged
respectively 8, 7. 5 and 2 years. At pres
ent they are partly fed by neighbors, but
when this charity ceases they will be ut
terly destitute, as the mother- is unable
to work. Yesterday the landlord called
to collect rent due. When he saw me
corpse he consented to extend the time
of eviction. It la a case which deserves
prompt attention, and the little father
less waifs should be cared for in some
public Institution.

dren, the Hired and infirm. Its merit is as

CONGRESSMAN FLETCHER HERE
Has Bepresented the District of Mm
neapolis for Four Terms.
Congressman L, Fletcher >>f Minne
apolis is registered at the Palace with
his sister-in-law and daughter. Mr.
Fletcher has been a member of Congress
for three terms and was again re-elected
at the last election for the fourth time.
He is a member of the Committee on In
terstate and Foreign Commerce and also
of the Committee on Territories. When
asked to give his views on questions of
national Interest Mr. Fletcher readily ac
quiesced In the following strain:
"I regard expansion as an inheritance
forced upon Â»is by a series of unfortu
nate circumstance, and we now cannot
very well dispose of it. We were getting
along fairly well without any additional
territory, but the Spanish war has given
us some which we must take care of.
However, the American people have
coped with grave questions before this
and 1 presume they will be equal to the
present emergency. Congress will ueaJ
with the problem and be governed by the
conditions aa they arise from time to
time. As far as Cuba, Porto Rico and
Hawaii are concerned th^re appear- to
be a well defined policy to allow the poo
pie to maintain a government of their
own. With the Philippines it is a differ
ent proposition. Nobody knows the capa
bilities or qualifications of those people
to govern themselves, and it looks as if
this nation v.ill have to undertake their
control and experience considerable
trouble in doing so.
!li *u as much struck in my travels
with the splendid conditions prevailing
throughout the entire United States. It
would appear that the long promised
prosperity has finally arrived and an era
of good feeling Is seen everywhere. I
noticed, too, that the free silver craze
has died of inanition and will be heard
they are paid to have in sight. Who
owns the land upon which the new El
Dorado is said to be located seems to be
a mystery. Neither Mr. Zammitt nor Mr.
English could recall last night the name
of the lucky mail. Zammitt says Eng
lish has an option on it, and English said
he had an option, but that it has expired
and he wants to get another one and put
in that chicken ranch. He was very
much afraid that a premature publication
of the rumors of a golden treasure in
the sands would so enhance the value of
real estate that there would not be the
ghost of a show for a chicken rancher
within a mile of the place.
Whether or not Messrs. English and
Zammitt haveâ or think they haveâ a
K"<Â»i tiling in "the sands, the fact remains
that there have hf-en people who have
maintained for years that gold in pay
ing quantities existed out near the ocean
beach. Zammitt is an old prospector, and
thoroughly familiar with the indications
for gold in the ground, and it is hardly
likely that he would have spent his
money and consumed his time in run
ning back ami forth from the assay office
if he did not believe that there wpre
prospects for more in the dirt he had
turned up than could be. found in any
chicken ranch.
This Is not the first attempt that has
been m;i'lo on this peninsula to tap a
Pactolean Btream. As long as forty years
ago a Frenchman named Perche invested
$10,000 on the San Miguel Rnncho in min
ing' operations. It is said that sold in pay
ing quantities was taken fmm his works,
but. owing to bad management, the en
terprise became a failure. Tn 1863 Ed
wan] ESw'ald, at the head of a company of
men. fins a shaft ninety-five feet deep in
the Sunset district, at a cost of $6000 The
rock uncovered $8 and $0 a ton but as
it took ore of the value of $30 a ton in
those days to return a profit after mill
ing 1 , the plan was abandoned.

TALKS ABOUT COPPER.
James A. Fleming Says Development
Is Slow in Arizona.
James A. Fleming, who owns a control
ling interest in the Black Warrior Copper
Mine of Globe. Ariz., is a guest at the
Palace. Mr. Fleming, in speaking of the
opening up of copper mines in Arizona
said:
"The development of copper minps in
I Arizona is going on gradually but surely.
i Within the last five years there have
been but two new properties that have
gone into mines. Our company has been
three and a half years opening up the
j Black Warrior, and we are about to put
| up a plant to treat the ore, which runs
; about l. r > per cent copper. We have InOO
: acres in claims. Tn about three months
we will be ready to handle 200 tons of ore
a day. which will average a yield of
twenjty or thirty tons.
"Very few copper mines are being dis
' covered at the present time. They were
! nearly all uncovered when prospectors
first went over the country. Michigan Is
i the only State In which the metal is
; found in its native form. In Wyoming,
Montana. Utah and Arizona so-called
i copper mines are really only iron mines
j carrying copper. One great difficulty with
i copper properties Is that at the water
level combinations of alkali dissolve the
metal and carry it off. In this way only
the surface is copper-bearing, and conse
: quently the metal is soon exhausted, al
though it may be found again at a greater
I depth.
"One of the reasons of the advance in
l the price of copper, which jumped from
11 to IS cents in the last year, is that the
production has not increased much during
the last eight years and the supply is not
equal to the demand. I am Inclined to
think, however, that the present price
: will remain stationary, or at least have
; very little fluctuation.
"Some time ago it was thought that
aluminum would take the place of cop
; per In wires for conducting electricity.
but the idea has been abandoned since the
Pennsylvania Railroad inaugurated a
i series of experiments to determine the
j value of aluminum for the purpose. It
was found that aluminum wins, after '
having been In use six or eight months.
did not possess the conductivity of copper
by one-third. This discovery caused the
price of copper to advance 3 cents a pound
in open market and proved conclusively
the superior adaptability of copper for
conducting purposes."

Big Crowds Enjoy the Day at the
Chutes and .Sutro Baths â Sleep
ing Driver and a
Runaway.
Many hundred wheelmen trundled the
park roads yesterday, but there was no
scorching. Captain Thompson procoedpd
under the new order prohibiting whrollnsr
at a greater speed than ten miles an hour.
Two of the regular park police, uniformed
and mounted on wheels, patrolled the
bicycle, paths and drives, while other of
ficers on foot were stationed at various
I points. Many cyclers who exceeded the
speed permitted were overhauled and
warned not to repeat the offense and then
released. As it was the first day the new
j order was enforced, no arrests were made,
but on future dates offending wheelmen
must explain before the courts.
Captain Thompson says the officers on
wheels did good work, and altogether the
first attempt to regulate the speed of the
army of cyclers was a success.
The crowd at the park was very large.
No accidents occurred, but one O'Don
nell. a brother of "Boogie," was enioving
I a good sleep while the horse he "was
! driving went tearing through the park
:at a hair-raising gait. Captain Thompson
1;. .-.-nt'l the runaway animal, brought it
to a standstill and awoke the driver.
O Donnell was startled when he found
himselt in the hands of the police, and
1 made many promises to remain awake if
1 given his freedom. As the shock of his
: awakening had improved his condition, he
I was released and continued on his drive.
j It was a big day at the Chutes. Over
i 8000 people passed through the gates dur
ing the day and enjoyed the varipus at
. tractions. In the theater a splendid vau
| deville bill was on. Those who purchased
tickets for the first entertainment, which
I lasted nearly an hour, were given return
; checks, and without extra expense saw
: the second performance, which was put
ion with a complete change of bill. The
I comedy end of the entertainment was ex
| .ceedingly good, and the ever-fascinatinsr
i animated pictures were run off for half
an hour. At the conclusion of the show
Emil Markeberg made a balloon ascen
sion. Aftff reaching thf dizzy height of
. about half a mile he cut loose from the
balloon and descended with the parachute.
A big crowd also assembled at Sutro
baths to witness the aquatic contests,
â¢ which wore both interesting and in some
instances exciting. The results of the
contests follow:
Fifty-yard dash, won by IT. Seehach, H. j
Daugherty second. T. Guerin carried off
first prize 1" the high diving contest for {
boys. C. Donevan second. J. A. Jackson I
won the obstacle racf through the small
tank and YV. Hurley took second money. :
The trapese high diving, open to all. was I
won by T. Guertn, with C. Donevan sec
ond. Trick and fancy springboard diving
