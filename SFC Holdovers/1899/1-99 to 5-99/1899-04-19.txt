TOM REED
WILL QUIT
PUBLIC LIFE
To Enter Upon the Practice
of Law at New
York.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Call Headquarters, Wellington Hotel,
Washington, April 18.
The report that Mr. Ret d intends to
resign fro] â¢ December
and to go into the law business in New-
York is generally credited here,
sails for Europe v.ith his family on
A .VÂ» Inesday and the fa>'t that he has
r publicly
indi< eserve the an
nouncement of his intention until after
! urn.
re is nothing that his friends can
the condition of affairs prom
for the n< â  ars to induce him
remain in i 'un^r"KS. He has
the honor for several terms
is practically nothing but
salary left In it. This is too
small for consideration. He knows too
much about the situation to expect to
my advancement toward the
y through another term in
the Speaker's chair, especially when he
Is threatened with the loss of power
and inf!u--i. Â» In position If }]<â  should
retain It through the i:ext Congress.
â¢ has been made of th
that a very tempting offer has been
held open to him in New York for some
time.
It is likely that his delay in announc
ing his intention is in the Interest of
â  s^ntative Sherman and for the
'iner a protracted
cership contest, running through
the entire Bummer, and disturbing the
party at a time when other things de
mand the attention of administration
and party leaders.
It will be remembered that Mr. Sher
man would not agree to remain in Con
gress for the pulp ise of opposing Reed
for the Bpeakership, and it was an
nounced that he would certainly retire
cept the Genera] Appraisership,
to which he had been appointed. It
not until after he had .met Mr.
dinner with some of tru' lead
ers in New York that he reconsidered
minatlon to leave Congress
and formally declined the appraiser
. ointment. It was Intimated
that time that this action was
th<- result of something paid by Mr.
: that Mr. Sherman had hopes
of becoming Speaker of the House
without op] . cd.
It is anticipated that there will be
a lively contest for the Rpeakership
whenever Mr. liecd publicly announces
his Intention to retire from Congress,
but the man who has advance infor
mation will have a. considerable ad
vantage In the contest. With the field
open there will probably be half a
dozen or more candidates. Sherman
of New York, Hopkins of Illinois, Hep.
burn of lowa, Grosvenor Of Ohio and
_â¢ â¢â ;! of Pennsylvania will be candi
dates, and it may be that Henderson of
lowa, Cannon of Illinois and Payne of
New York will make a contest for the
delegations from their respective States
against Hepburn, Hopkins and Sher
man. -*'-â â ;

MURDERER
SHOT DOWN
BY A MOB
The Last Act of the Patter
son Tragedy Has Been
Carried Out.
' : to The fall.
CLINTON. Ark., April is. âYesterday
morning between 12 and 2 o'clock was
enacted the final scene jn the terrible
Patterson tragedy, which took place on
December 13, 1897, in which Hugh Pat
â i lost his life and several other
members of his family were seriously
wounded.
A mob of citizens took the law into
their own hands and shot Will Harden,
one of the Patterson murderers, to
death in the cage at the County Jail.
Lee Mills, a proi Inent young man
and once a Deputy Sheriff "of Van
n County, and Will Harden were
sted, charged with the Patterson
murder. Several attempts to lynch
them were frustrated and an attempt
'â ii tii" part of their friends to liberate
them from jail resulted in a guard be
ing killed. . Mills was convicted on
Hardens testimony and he paid the
death penalty several months ago,
Harden "was convicted ai the Septem
ber tÂ« rm of court and the case wai ap
-5 to the Supreme Court, which
granted a new trial. At the March
term he was again convicted and sen
â l to hang May 9. No appeal was
taken, but a commutation was asked of
the Governor and granted.
When the people learned that execu
tive clemency had been granted there
was much excitement. About fifty
well-armed masked men went to the
Jailer and commanded him to go and
unlock the jail, which he did under
cover. of a shotgun. The jailer and
night guard were marched Inside the
jail, when one of the mob, who had
acted as spokesman, emptied the con
tents of a double-barreled shotgun into
Hardens head, blowing it almost en
tlrely away. The mob then fastened
the jailer and guard in the jai! and loft
as silently as they came. N,, demon
stration of any sort was made am] if
was some time before the town knew
what had occurred. â¢
The Coroner's jury returned a ver
dict that Harden came to his death by
gunshot wounds at the hands of parties
unknown. -
GOMPERS ON THE NEED
OF A DEFENSE FUND
Says It Is the Greatest Safeguard of
the Trade Unions of
To-Day.
"WASHINGTON*. April IS.â Samuel Oom
pers, president of 'the American Federa
tion of Labor, was the principal witness
before the Industrial commission to-day.
Mr. Gompers' statement touched chf< fly
mi the trade union "defense fund," meth
ods of organization, the general theory of
strikes, the Incorporation of trades unions
and the use of the boycott.
He safd the defense fund was the great
tfeguard â¢ â¢ k's union. The
Federation of Labor was now accumulat
ing one. He had always found that the
higher the dues and the larger the de
fense fund of any trades union the better
and stronger was its organization and the
less liable was It to be forced Into an aoi
ual strike. Briefly, he said that an em
ployer would engage In a fight with 10U,
--000 men a good deal quicker than he would
fight *10G,WO.
The question of laws to provide for the
incorporation of the trades unions did not
meet with Mr. Gompern' approval.

BERLIN, April 18.â The corre
spondent here of the Associated
Press hears on authority that the
German Consul at Apia, Samoa, Herr
Rose, will receive cabled instructions,
to be conveyed to him by steamer
from the nearest cable station, to join
in a tripartite proclamation calling
upon all the inhabitants of Samoa to
immediately desist from all hostili
ties and agitation pending the arri
val at Apia of the Joint Commission
of the powers appointed to settle the
affairs in dispute in the islands.
CHICAGO. April 18.â A private letter
red here to-day from H. J. Moore,
an" American merchant in Samoa, who
for years has been Mataafa's
< and adviser, related some In
teresting details of the troubles in the
islands. The letter, written March ..\
says:
When I received, in advance of its post
ing, a copy of the proclamation decided
upon by the British and American Bides
and issued by Admiral Kautz. I thought
it a very, moderate document and one
that might â¢well be observed. I sent â¢word
twice to the natives on Mulimni that I
thought they should obey It. and I think
they so intended, as Mullnuu was soon
deserted and the prisoners liberated, while
the royalists went to TJtila for those
who were up there. I promised Captain
White of the Philadelphia that I would
do all I could to facilitate a quick and
satisfactory arrangement, and sent word
to Mataafa and the chiefs that no sailors
would be landed and no guns given to
the prisoners: that they ought to go to
their homes and observe peace while the
powers deliberated.
I am sure Mataafa's followers would
have done just as Admiral Kautz wanted
and as I was advising, when British Con
sul Maxse commenced, arming the re
turned prisoners and they began to boast
of what they were going to do with the
assistance of the warships. This news ar
rived when Mataafa was speaking in the
very midst of a meeting in which he was
dismissing the people. At once a great
number arose, crying: "The weak cannot
govern the strong; our slaves shall not
rule us. We shall fight," and the meeting
was broken up.
It is a singular fact that these wild sav
ages. aÂ« they are frequently represented
to be, have not up to new destroyed a
s!:ik!'- white man's house, though all over
the islands they are in full possession <>t
tin'in everywhere, the back nan of Apia
being at thHr mercy now. While the nine
of the Pomoise can now be heard blast
ing habitations the homes of Gurr and
Carruthers. who have caused all the
trouble, remain unmolested by Mataafa's
followers.
To subjugate this country will require
not less than 10.000 troops, with accessor
ies, and then a great loss from exposure
and casualties must be counted on. The
0 imoans are not cowards; uiey are fight
ing in a just cause and God knows I hope
this will soon be recognized and appre
ciated. ____________
BALDWIN RENEWS TWO
HEAVY OBLIGATIONS
Los Angeles County Ranches Again
Mortgaged to a San Francisco
Sank.
LOS ANGELES, April 18. â "Lucky"
Baldwin, tho famous landowner and rac
ing man, has been compelled to renew his
mortgage on a part of his magnificent
estate in Los Angeles County known as
the Rancho la Puente and Rancho Clenega
del Paao de la TlJera. to secure, a loan of
$400,000 advanced by the German Savings
Bank of San Francisco. A trust deed
conveying the pledged property to B. A.
Becker and George Tourny. trustees for
the society, was to-day filed with the
County Recorder. To the instrument, was
affixed $200 in revenue stamps.
Both of the pledged estates are within
the confines of this, county and comprise
about 20.000 acres. The properties are
Bald to be worth $3,000,000.
The creditor society had a mortgage of
$350,000 on the same ranches for a number
of years and the new and enlarged obliga
tion is the successor of that debt.
Baldwin's Santa Anita ranch Is said to
be mortgaged, and the impression Is
abroad that unless he soon parts with
some of his valuable land holdings in
Southern California interest and taxes
will have a tendency to absorb the equi
ties these lands once possessed.
BOOTHS REMOVED AND
SIDE ENTRANCES CLOSED
Los Angeles Police Enforcing the
Ordinance Regulating the
Saloons.
LOS ANGELES. April I*â The Police
Commission, at its sessions- to-day, offi
cially determined to take out of saloons
the private booths they contain. The
question of enforcing the closing of side
entrances to any and all saloons was
finally decided, and Chief Glass was in-
Btructed to carry out the provisions of
the ordinances. In presenting this ques
tion to the board Mayor Eaton said:
â¢'ln many of these saloons there are
stairways leading to basements, which
are used almost exclusively by young
girls and their escorts, who are on the
down roiA. They drink liquors in such
basements procured from the saloons
above. I have convinced myself by per
sonal observation that this is the existing
state of affairs. Many proprietors say
they do not desire such custom, but that
they are in no position to prevent it. To
aid them we will close these side and back
entrances and remove the booths and
curtains that hide and shelter unseemly
conduct."

THE PLAGUE
YET RAGES
IN BOMBAY
A Thousand Deaths Weekly,
but Government Hopes
to Control Disease.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
BOMBAY, April 18.â According to
statistics gathered regarding the bu
bonic plague it Is established that there
have been 2."0,000 deaths recorded in In
dia since its beginning. These figures,
however, are undoubtedly far below the
actual total, as the natives are known
to have concealed quite a number of
deaths.
Bombay Presidency suffered the
most, being responsible for 134,000
deaths, without counting those which
occurred in the city of Bombay, which,
with Kuraccho, were the chief hotbeds
of the disease.
The deaths in Bombay presidency are
still about 1000 weekly. With the re
turn of hot weather the plague, which
is now the third epidemic, is again
rapidly disappearing. The mortality,
which was 250 daily in the city of
Bombay five weeks ago, has now sunk
to. 100 per day, and the Government has
dropped the rigorous repressive meas
ures which, it has been found, it iÂ« im
possible to maintain indefinitely in the
face of the fatalist resignation of the
natives.
The Madras Presidency is fairly free
frmn the plague, its climate and soil, it
is argued, not being favorable to the
spread of the epidemic.
The Bengal Presidency has suffered
to some extent, Including Calcutta, but
the situation has not been grave, and
the spread of the plague is now de
creasing. Tjie Haffklne fluid has been
very successful.
DR. HARRIS FAILS IN
THEATRICAL VENTURES
NEW YORK, April 18.â Another benefit
for Rev. James H. W. Harris, formerly
pastor of the Episcopal Church of the
Redeemer in Oakland, Cal., is in course
of preparation. The last one was to have j
been given a week ago last Sunday night, j
but it did not take place, owing to the j
failure of Mr. Harris to make the required
deposit for rent. He went to Edwin ;
Knuwles, manager of the Fifth avenue
Theater, a year ago and arranged to rent
the theater for a series of "Sunday Even
ing Patriotic Concerts," the proceeds to j
be given to "women's sanitary work" and ;
to "purchase portraits of the Maine for
our public schools." Subscribers were to
have their names printed in tho nuwspa
pers, and among the names of the "pa
trons" were given those of C. P. Hunting
ton, George Crocker, A. N. Bra.iy, J.
Pierpont Morgan and former Governor
Flower.
Mr. Harris did not rent the theater. Mr.
Knowles said to-day ho understood the
affair was to be a "subscription benefit,"
and that money did not come in.
Mr. Harris, when told to-day that com- j
plaints had been made of the failure of i
his theatrical enterprises after subscrip
tions had been paid in, said:
"Some one who Is envious of the work
I am doing is trying to prevent it. For
the last year I have been doing non-sec
tarian work in Now York City. I am
pomewhat in debt and am perfectly will
ing to pay every dollar if I am let' alone.
This is a benefit for me personally, inas
much as I have done everything and re
ceived nothing for over a year. I have
nothing to hide. This is simply a matter
of persecution."
Mr. Harris is about to give up all
thought of the stage and return to reli
gious work.

BEEF COURT
SURE TO FIND
AGAINST MILES
The Preparation of the Find
ings Has Already Been
Commenced.
Sneelal Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, April 18.â The army
court of inquiry has begun the framing
of its report. While a few minor mat
ters remain for examination they are
not such as to affect the main facts.
It Is regarded as certain that the court
will find that General Miles' charges
that embalmed or chemically prepared
beef was sent to the army have not
been sustained. The position of the
court is believed to be that the testi-.
mony is conclusive that both the re
frigerated beef and the canned beef
wt'ip in good condition when delivered
to the Government and continued so
until issued to the troops, except that
portion damaged in transportation or
affected by tropical conditions, and to
these causes of injury and these con
ditions the chief causes of trouble will
be attributed. It will be shown that
the refrigerated beef after being taken
from the ice in the tropical climate
spoils quickly unless well cared for and
that the canned beef, after being
opened, because of the great heat, be
comes repulsive in appearance and soon
unpalatable. But the court will hold,
as the result of chemical investigations
by experts, that the canned beef is
wholesome and nutritious. Attention
will be called to the fact that it was
used throughout the war by our navy
and is still used by the fleet. It is be
lieved that the court will criticize those
officers who have testified that they be
came aware that bad beef was issued
to the troops and failed to report their
observations until after the war had
closed.

unknown, which is called Danrn.
Captain Adrien de Gorlache, chief of the
expedition, is still at Punta Arenas. He

Europe.
Lieutenant Danco, who had charge of
the magnetic observations service for the
expedition, died in June, 1898, rs already
told in a special cable dispatch to the

named in his honor.

CHICAGO, April 18.â Major General
Shafter passed through Chicago to-day
en route to his brother's home in Syca
more, 111.
Discussing the Philippine war he
said: "If General Lawton says 100,000
men are needed in the Philippines in
order to effectually end hostilities and
bring the natives to terms I should say
that undoubtedly an army of such pro
portions is required. "We of the army
have supreme confidence in General
Lawton's judgment, and it is his prac
tice to underestimate rather than ex
aggerate when passing upon existing
conditions.
"I don't know Otisâ never saw him,"
the general added. "I think Lawton
hiul a right to criticize the tactics of
the commanding general if he believed
tin m to be unwise.
"The Filipino is a suspicious fellow,
just like the Cuban. He can't see the
good intentions of this Government and
he never will until we subjugate him
with powder and ball.
"I have said before that it may be
necessary to kill half the population
i of the islands in order that the re
maining half may be lifted from
their semi-barbarity to the civiliza
tion we are ready to give them."
"And let me tell you," General Shaf
ter concluded, impressively, "that I do
not believe our troubles in Cuba are
over by any means."

The disnatrh caused much excite
ment in naval circles as soon as its con
tents became known. It was received
late in the day. and considerable de
lay was occasioned by the blindness of
some of the cipher words. It was im
possible to completely decipher it, but
the general sense of it was plain.
Lieutenant Gilmore, the officer re
ferred to as captured, is well known in
Washington, having been stationed
here for some time, and hia wife and
family live here. He was born In Phila
delphia July 10, 1854, and was appointed
a naval, cadet from Arizona in Septem
ber, 1871. He reached his present grade
of lieutenant in 1891. His main service
has been on the Monongahela, Marion,
Bancroft, Vesuvius and Machias, be
sides considerable service on the naval
boards. Just a year ago he reported to
the St. Paul, then commissioned a a
auxiliary cruiser, and served on that
vessel under Captain Sigsbee through
out the war. On January 14 Inst h<Â»

THE OSOPHISTS IN
MYTHICAL ROLES
"Eumenides" Presented
on Point Loma.
By MRS. H. H. SOMERS.
Special Dispatch to Th" Call.
PAN DIEGO. April 18.â The site of the
School for the Revival of the Lost Mys
teries of Antiquity presented a busy
scene on Monday while the last prepara
tions for the presentation of the Greek
play "Eumenides" were in progress.
Now features have been added by Mr.--. Ting
ley In the last few days to better develop the
beauties and power of the drama. The large
audience was collectively prepared, more or
less, some by study, some by natural in
stinct, some by curiosity to receive its mean
ing. To Fay that It was a great success would
by no means convey an adequate conception.
A new era in the drama is being inaugurated
and It will become a powerful Instrument In
the Interest of human advancement and prog
ress.

la the last of a
trilogy or set of three plays, with one plot
running through the set. in the first Aga
memnon returns home from the siege of Troy,
bringing with him Cassandra, a native pro
phetess. He finds that during his absence
his Quoen, nnestra, has been ruling the
Kingdom In conjunction with her lover, Aegis
thus. Clytemnestra welcomes her returned
lord, but, when she discovers Cassandra, she
treacherously murders her husband and also
Cassandra.
In the second play, the "Chaepharae," OreÂ«
tes, the son of Agamemnon, is ordered by
Apollo to slay his mother, Clytemnestra, and
does co, urged on by his sister, Electro. In
"Eumenides," the Bumenides, who are the
agentH of the avenging Nemesis, appearing as
hideous hags, pursue Orestes for the murder
cf his mother, but Apollo protects him, Orestes
being Apollo's suppliant and having acted un
der the god's orders. The Bumenidea being
obdurate, the matter is tried before a Jury
of Athenian nobles, with Athena, the goddess
of wisdom, as Judge. The votes for and
against Orestes are equal and Athena casts
her vote in his favor, declaring that In future
all people shall be similarly acquitted. The
Kumenides rage in baffled spite and vow to
blast the earth with barrenness and pesti
lence. But Athena soothes away their anger
by promoting them to be the agents of pros
perity and beneficence, so that henceforth
these avenging furies become the bestowers or
happiness and peace. '- â  -
Mr. Basil Crump essayed the part of Apollo
and would have received the commendation of
the god himself.
Mrs. Southwick of Boston was Athena in
person. The most striking feature of the pro
duction was the entrance of Athena In a
chariot of blue and gold, drawn by a rnagnlfl
cent pair of pure white horses, which was In
answer to the supplication and Invocation of
Orestes, who was on the verge of being over
come and torn to pieces by the Furies.
11. T. Patten of New York, one of the
students of. the Jsls League, as Orestes, gave
the decided Impression that he ha had expe
rience with Furies and could appreciate the Joy
of ling released from their pursuit.
All the minor parts were well sustained. All
the actors are members of the Universal Broth
erhood, except three ladies of Ban Diego. The
scenery was symbolic In color, and was paint
ed under those laws an understanding of which
Is necessary to give the desired results. Un
der the lamplight the effect of It was very
beautiful. The music was archaic, and though
somewhat unusual in some parts, was pecu
liarly attractive. In fact, in this play the
combined forces of color, music and dramatic
action are needed to fully express the under
lying principles of the play.
Mrs. Elizabeth C. Mayer, directress of the
musical department of the Isis League of Mu
sic and Drama, deserves much credit for the
manner in which she and her department per
formed, under the guidance of Mrs. Tlngley,

At the public meeting held In the amphi
theater on Point Loma on Sunday afternoon,
general discussion of the philosophy of â  life !
took place, brief addresses being made by va
rious international representative! to the
Brotherhood. One of the best Of the addresses
was delivered by Dr. Herbert Coryn of Lon
don. England. He said in part:
"It la not easy to compress one's ideas on
tlie philosophy of life into five minutes. Those
of you who hear the name of our organisation
for the first lime will naturally ask: '.Well,
what are you getting at. anyhow? Have you
anything new to say?' Now, the philosophy
of life to which we want to call your attention I
is perfectly simple to speak of, easy to under
stand, and capable of reforming the world and
making it a pleasant place to live in. Every
religion has gradually rot Itself overgrown
with a lot of dogmas and men's attention Is bo
fastened on these that they forget the root. At
last they come to disbelieve and reject the
dogma* and there Is now great danger lest i
! they throw the Brotherhood idea overboard ;
j along with the dogmas. At some time all great ;
religious teachers have been asked to compress I
their teachings into a sentence and they all I
did so In nearly the same words or Idea?: 'Love
thy fellow man." So we claim that that iB the
way to go If a man wants to be either happy 'â 
or wise.
"What are men pursuing from day to day?
Happiness. When they have got it, it does
not satisfy, and it is painful to look back upon j
the time when they had got it. Bo no one of
thÂ» desires that men have can give any pleas
ure when it is satisfied. But let each man look
into himself and note the surprising fact that j
the only really satisfying pleasure comes from ;
acts of brotherly kindness. Clearly we have ]
got hold of the right philosophy of life. This
Is the way to pleasure It Is also the way to
health, for there is no more certain way of
getting free from disease and to prolong life
than to have the soul and body drenched with
pleasure.
"Once in a while when some desire for your j
own personal comfort or convenience comes up
Just. for fun try the trick of putting it aside
| in favor of another desire, for some other per- i
son's good or comfort. By this simple method
â¢ you will find that your mind has gradually be
: come clear and happy. Your consciousness will
grow too big to be wholly packed Into your
| body. Becoming mentally clear, you will easily
perceive this and will understand what all the
teachers of humanity have said, namely, that
the mind, the man, the soul does not die when
the body does. You "ill no longer fear the
simple practice and philosophy of brotherhood,
that of the Universal Brotherhood organiza
tion."

GOVERNOR HENRY OF
PORTO RICO RELIEVED
NEW YORK, April 13.â A Washington,

i if General Henry, the new Governor Gen

d, bul the iissignment of Brigadier
General Grant to the Philippines has been j

Instructions were sent to-day to Gen

United States the Eleventh Infantry Reg
iment, which ha? seen the greatest length
of service on the island, and two li^ht
batteries <>f the Seventh Artillery. This
will leave an American garrison of .only
the Nineteenth Infantry, the Fifth Cav
alry, three batteries of the Fifth Artil
lery and the Fourth Company of the Vol
unteer Signal ( 'orps.
This reduction of tho force is the result j
of Secretary Aiger's recent visit. He
found the Porto Ricans quiet and orderly
and extremely patriotic, and he believes
there is no necessity of menacing them
by retaining a strong force.

The Scindia was placed in the drydook '

considerable repairing, and an extra large
force of mm was put at work, as the de

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1899.
RATHER LATE JUSTICE
TO POOR ROGER WILLIAMS
Massachusetts Legislature fished
to Revoke the Old Sentence
of Barjishment.
BOSTON', April IS.â ln the House to-day Mr. Davis of Cambridge
presented a petition and resolution revoking the sentence of banish
ment of Roger Williams, the famous Colonial preacher, which was
passed October 1, 1635.
The reason given by the petitioners is that the doctrine of religious
liberty, the advocacy of which led to Williams' banisment, has be
come the fundamental sentiment of Christendom.
This is one of the most unique pieces of legislation ever known here.
The petition is signed by Rev. I. W. Grimes, Rev. S. Walker, Rev. O. Sher
wood. G. A. Maynard, Rev. J. D. Fulton, J. D. Rollfns, Rev. Dr. C. B.
Brane, Rev. Dr. Howe, A. N. Hardy, J. W. Drew and T. N. Merriman.
The petition came Into the House just as it was about to take up a
very live local issue, and in view of the more pressing character of the
problems of to-day, it was decided to let Roger's case rest for another
year, so that tho petition was referred to the next General Court. Few
members, in fact, knew anything about the contents of the document,
since the clerk read it by the title only. It was nominally presented
by Representative Davis of Cambridge, but that gentleman disavows
any personal interest in the matter.
The petition was signed by a number of Baptist clergymen, and was
brought to the State House by one of them, who, in order to get it be
fore tho General Court, had to have it presented by a member, and Mr,
Davis performed the service. There is no doubt whatever of its being
passed at the next session.
ONCE BELIEVED
DREYFUS GUILTY
Picquart Found He Was
in Error.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS. April 19.â The Figaro publishes
to-day the conclusion of Colonel Pic
quart's deposition before the Court of
Cassation in th* Dreyfus inquiry, together
with the testimony of Jules Ruche, mem
ber of the Chamber of Deputies for the
Second District of Tournon. and of
i hers, as well as a numtx r of letters
from Esterhazy to M. Rocheâ altogether
about twenty-four columns.
Colonel Picquart told the court of the
various missions which General Qonae
confided to him in Tunis, all of whirl
d him that he was under the l
displeasure. His mail matter always
reached him unsealed and was Invariably
by others before being dispatched.
it- complained of this treatment to U< u
tctiant Colonel H<*nry. but they refused to
give him any satisfaction.
In August, 1896, after his examination of
the dossier, he was convinced, Colonel
Picauart declared, of the guilt of Dreyfus,
and not until his return from Africa In
March, 1897, did he confide to a friend, ;<.
lieutenant colonel, his conviction thai an
error had been made by t tie court-martial
and that Esterhaay was the real culprit.
At this period his relations with Lieu
tenant Colonel Henry ceased to be friend
ly. In the following June he became
aware that machinations were brewing
against himself, and he confided all his
papers to Maitre Le Blois, his counsel, for
surety. He then returned to Tunis.
â  nel Picquart remarked upon the
Idence that Esterhazy's letter to the
Minister of War. Indicating his (Pic
quart's) movements, was dated October
23 1897, and that the date of the order
ng him to the Trlpolitan frontier
wan October Ti. After referring to Ls
terhaiy's letter and the "Blanche/ ana
"Sporanza" telegrams he detailed his re
call to Paris to testify before General
Pellieux. He said he was called before the
latter on the day following his arrival,
having seen only Major Mtercler-Mllan,
sent by the general staff to receive him.
This officer told him the general staff
was not ill-disposed toward him, but
nevertheless he noticed that he was under
close police surveillance. He reproached
General Pellieux for crediting the false
ieports representing him (Picquart) v a
neurotic and as occupying himself with
occultism. Ho denied that he was an
â¢ist and said General Pellieux treat
ed him with severity exceeding all per
missible bounds.
Passing to the court-martial of Ester
hazy. Colonel Picu.uart again protest* d
against the attitude of General Pellieux,
who, he said, overwhelmed him with
questions without the consent of the
counsel for the defense, or the president
of the court-martial.
"It was easy to see," declared Picauart.
â 'that I was the real accused."
Then he proceeded to relate how, al
though General Luxor promised that he
should be confronted with his opponents,
he was only confronted with lieutenant
Colonel Henry, despite the protest of one
of the Judges, who demanded the carry
ing out of General Luxor's promise.
Dealing with subsequent inquiries. Col
onel Picquart'B story was one of similar
hindrances ami of attempts to stifle In
vestigation. He testified that, after M.
Cavaignac'a famous speech in the Cham
ber ot Deputies, he wrote to the presi
dent of the council, warning him against
the Henry forgery. The witness referred
to letters from the Minister of War to
the Minister of Justice against him, and
denied that any animosity existed be
tween himself and Colonel Paty dv I'lam.
The witness added that Henry's forgery
"became necessary in order to maintain
the charge of guilt against Dreyfus."
Before replying to M. Castelin's inter
pellation the Minister of War appeared
unfavorable to Esterhazy and inclined to
believe in the innocence of Dreyfus. Hen
ry's forgery made the situation clear.
Colonel Picquart said he was absolutely
convinced that all the documents subse
quent to Henry's forgery and connected
with it were themselves forgeries.
The testimony of the other witnesses
was unimportant.
It was rumored here last evening that
the Court of Cassation, encouraged by the
Ministers who desire to mef>t the Chamber
of deputies with a well-defined situation,
will dispense with the proposed con
frontation of General Roget. Colonel Pie
quart. M. Bortulus, the magistrates and
others in order to hurry its derision he
fore the Chamber meets. It is further as
serted that the court's revision will be
that no new facts have been adduced jus
tifying revision, which the court will ac
cordingly reject.
FRENCH GOVERNMENT
MAY PARDON DREYFUS
LONDON, April 19.â The Paris corre
spondent of the Times, referring to the
rumors that the Court of Cassation will
abridge the Dreyfus revision' inquiry in
order to enable the Government to k<* be
fore the chamber of Deputies with a well
defined situation and that its decision will
be against revision on the ground of non
discovery' of new facts, says:
"Such a solution would only result in a
continuance of the struggle in a more
violent and dangerous form than ever,
not only In France but throughout the
civilised world."
The Paris correspondent of the Daily
News, who r< Lr.'wd? such a possible course
as "an endeavor to gag Captain Frey
statter of the original court-martial, win
would show cause for annulling the Drey
fus judgment, but will not be suffered to
speak," says:
"I believe the Government intends to
pardon Dreyfus as soon as the Court of
Cassation has delivered judgment. There
is a majority of ten against him. One
already wavers. A large proportion of
the others are old men. some of whom are
not in the best health, and the Influenza
might any day remove them. The Gov
ernment, knowing this, hurried the pro
ceedings with a view of insuring a deci
sion that will please the army and the
maas of electors."
STILL NO RESULT
FROM THE INQUIRY
LITTLE CHANCE OF PRESIDIO
RIOTERS BEING CAUGHT.
The investigation into the riot at the
Presidio Sunday night is proceeding
slowly, but the result seems as distant as
ever. Lieutenant Devore of the Twenty
third Infantry, who has the case in
charge, was among the suspects all day
yesterday asking searching questions and
hearing the evidence of non-commissioned
officers and privates, but his labors made
matters no dearer and did not increase
the chances of bringing to'justico the m< D
who were responsible for the outrage. It
was the same story from each. They had
i been downtown on leave or had just gone
out to the fire to see what was happening.
They would not or could not give defin
ite information, and the inquiry could go
no further than the mere asking of ques
tions.
A further obstacle was thrown in the
way of the Investigation yesterday morn
ing whÂ«>ti two hundred and llfty of the
"casuals" were marched off the reserva 1
Uon and w< n put aboard the Warren.now
to sail for .Manila. The men ordered
to the Philippines were notified of their
destination Monday morning and were
told to make themselves ready to move
at any time. They may include all the
ringleaders of the row of Sunday night
or they may not have a rioter in their
ranks; n>< one but the soldiers themselves

Last evening the members of the News

the suggestion of "Happy" Dougherty,
Michael Joyce was elected recording sec

"Happy" Dougherty then turned over the
funds of the association to Day and re
quested that the boys hereafter recog

of Mayor Phelan was then proposed for
treasurer and a committee of one ap-
Sointed to wait upon him and request that

The difficult problem of the evening was
the selection of a sergeant-at-arms. None
of th>- boys seemed desirous of holding
the position, but "Skinny Dutch." "Bow

fraternity as the "Illuminated New xork")
and Max Roberts were at length prevailed

chairman and G. W. Blum secretary
The object of the meeting was to dis
cuss the advisability of the oarsmen
withdrawing from the Pacific Associa
tion of the Amateur Athletic Union and
forming a new body, to be named the
Pacific or Western Rowing Association
It was stated that the A. A. U., of which
the Pacific Association is a branch dues
not recognize rowing, or attempt to con
trol it. but leaves that to the National
Association of Amateur Oarsmen; that
the regatta committee of the Pacific As
sociation has had charge of all the oars
men's regattas, and that the oarsmen
would do better to control the sport
themselves and affiliate with the N A
"V , O ", to â¢ Mch almost all the rowing
dubs in the I nited States belong The
oafsmen would then have properly
measured courses, and their records
would be accepted. The Alameda and
bouth End delegation spoke strongly in
favor of the, formation of a new associa
tion. The Ariel and Dolphin delegates
were in favor of staying with the P. A.
A., which they say has a good standing
and has alwuys managed the affairs ol
the rowing men satisfactorily. 3"hey al-o
asserted that oarsmen registered in the
P. A. A. are entitled to take part in
swimming contests, track and field
events, and all branches of athletics ion

and animated discussion the meeting ad
journed without reaching any definite
conclusion.

HERO OF MANILA
TO BE HONORED
San Jose Preparing for
Dewey Day.
Scecial Dispatch to The Call.
PAX JOSE. April 18.â The people of San
Josp and Santa Clara County will honor
Admiral Dewey on May 1 with a monster
celebration at Agricultural Park. Busi
ness of all kinds will be sus
pended and the bravo admiral and
his fight at Manila will be the subject of
the jollification. Everything is to be
Dewey that day. Prizes have been offered
for a topical song;, a commemorative od-e,
an original poem, a poster, a naval or
military farce, a floral design, a march
and a gavotte of Dewey at Manila. There
will be a fine musical and literary pro
gramme.
The celebration will open at Biinrise with
a cannon salute and until sunset there
will not be a dull moment. A number of
the marines, sailors and officers fmm the
lowa will be present. They will be given
a reception at the depot, after which a
parade will be formed and the march
taken up to Agricultural Pnrk. Here a
basket picnic, and reunion will be held.
Refreshments will be server]. Games of
various kinds and athletic sports will be
enjoyed. A feature is the baseball game
between Stanford University and Santa
Clara College.
Besides celebrating the defeat of the
Spanish the success of the undertaking
means much to San Jose. The proci i <!s
arc to help in the erection of an art build
ing to house the fine collection of paint-
Ings Mrs. M. P. O'Connor has donated to
the people of tills city. The coll si tlon is
an exceedingly fine one and is worth thou
sands of dollars. It was with the- proviso
that a building be erected that Mrs.
O'Connor made the gift. It contains many
magnificent copies of works by the old
masters. While there are not quite so
many originals as in the Crocker gallery
at Sacramento, yet in many respects it
is superior to that collection. The State
has already given a site for the building
In the Normal School square. It is pro
poped to put $20.(100 in the building. Some
$5000 has been subscribed. The executive
committee of the Aic Building Associa
tion, which has charge of the celebration,
is as follows: Mrs. E. O. Smith, presi
dent; Mrs. Nicholas Bowden, vice presi
dent; Mrs. R. S. Hoi way, secretary; Mrs.

The ladies have received encouraging
letters from Mrs. Jan" L. Stanford, Pro
f. ssor David Starr Jordan and other
prominent persons. Even Collis P. Hunt
mgton, who has the, reputation of be
ing exceedingly close in this respect, has
consented to supply I'ree transportation
for the. Inwa crew to San Jose and re
turn. Huntington sent the following let
ter to Mrs. Mitchell Phillips, acting presi
dent of the Art Association:
SAN FRANCISCO, April IT, 1899.
I am in receipt of your letter of the i<th,
relative to the Dewey day celebration which
It If proposed to hold at Agricultural Park in
San Joss, and in repft- beg to Â«ay that the
request you proffer that the Southern Pacific
donate the transportation of a car to he at
tached to the train leaving San Francisco May
1 at 7 a. m., returning the same afternoon,
meets with my cordial assent.
The company will be both willing and pleased
to do this in the hope that It may help to
make the celebration In honor of the hero of
Manila as successful as you all hope it may
be. I am very glad you let us know about it.
I asked Mr. Kruttschnitt, our general man
ager. if there was any reason why we should
not accommodate cur numerous friends in San
Jose by granting this request, and he re
sponded, "By no means. The people of San
Jose have always been particularly friendly
with our company and I think we should all
be glad to show them this courtesy."
Mr. Kruttsehnltt now has the matter in
mind and will make the arrangement as you
desire. Very truly yours.

Dr. Sehorn's Testimony
Stricken Out.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS. April IS.â When the Mur
dock note case was called this morn
ing Judge Pirkey announced that, after
having looked np authorities, ho had
decided the evidence of Dr. Sehorn
which he admitted last week, was Ir
relevant. He ordered that it be strjckei
from the records. Sehorn testified that
he had a conversation in March, 1894,
with Executor Burton of the Murdoi k
estate and that Burton had told him
that had William Murdock lived a week
longer the note would have been
settled.
After Judge Pirkey had instructed
the jury to pay no attention to the evi

Morrison Bryan to impeach the evi

he heard a. conversation between Mary
Helen Murdock and William Murdock,
wherein William Murdock admittl the

had to go to California i<> testify in the
Murdock case, and that if his si-d" won

JAPANESE COMING
IN BY HUNDREDS
Arrival of Hordes of
Coolies.
Sceclal Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, April IS.â Japanese labor
ers are yet coming into the Northwest
by hundreds. The steamer (ilenogle,
arriving on Saturday, brought 200, <>f
hich 145 are being landed here. 1m-
Igrant Inspector Walker is being as
! in examining them by Special
upervisor Watchorn of Washington,
who has charge of immigrant inspec
tion work throughout the L'nited
States. Inspector Watchorn is making
ljis annual tour erf investigation, but
while here is looking closely into the
charges recently made by persons and
newspapers that the contract labor
laws apparently were being violated in
tiic importation of so many Japanese.
Mr. Watchora declared to-day that
the examination of immigrants was
conducted as rigidly at Northwestern
points as anywhere in the country. It
is done secretly here, as elsewhere, as
provided by the law and r<
governing immigrant inspection. Wat
chorn says he was partly responsible
for the passage of this law. li was
found iry, because otherwise
men endeavoring to import contra
would be enabled to cluster
around, and by signs and nods inter
fere with a just examination.
This statement has not wholly satis
fied members of labor organizai
and others, who feel that more Ftrin
rules should be applied, with the
I of decreasing Japanese immi
gration. These men claim that at the
nt rate the Japanese will
me as obnoxious as Chinese coolies.
They feel certain there la some connec
tion between this wholesale arrival of
Japanese and the fact that more than
ibcrers have been em
ployed during the past y ar as section
men on the Northern Pacific, the Ore
gon Railway and Navigatiun and the
n Short Line railroads. W. H.
Remington of Tacoma, formerly of Salt
Lake, is said to have contracts with
the railroads named whereby he re-
B a stipulated amount per day for
< ach Japanese laborer supplied. He, in
turn, hires them of Japanese agents at
a less iiguro.
â¢ Th.^ railroads are said to be saving
considerable money by this peculiar
contract system, which was started a
year ago "when laborers were very

FA.CTS and figures gathered by
The Call through its correspond

phasize the fact that 1899 is des
tined to be one of the prosperous
years in the history of California. Ffom
|y every county reports have been
received showing that the acreage in
grain and fruits Is greatly in excess of
that of last year, and the yield promises
to be much larger. Early in the season
the prospects in certain sections were
not of the brightest, but the rain came
am', grain and fruit took on new life.
Within the past month so favorable
have been the weather conditions that
of the counties report the grain
yield this year will be 200 per cent
greater than that of a year ago. In the
districts that have been under the
I of drought for several seasons
past the farmers now are preparing to
harvest an abundant yield and the
orchards are laden with a wealth of
fruit.
Significant in the returns are the
figures relating to the sugar-beet in

road owned the land on the island, ex
cepi a strip along the bay, there was
no opportunity for Huntington to ob
t.'iiii ;i foothold.
A year ;ik" the Catalina Yacht Club
obtained tfom the Terminal people by
deed of gift four lots fronting 100 feet
on the ocean, the club agreeing to use
thr> land for club purposes only. A
clubhouse was erected, which, owing to
the encroachments of the ocean, was
moved. Tin- club later purchased a
snip of land LOO feet wide, extending
from the lagoon opposite Wilmington
i" the railway. This ground was ob
tains! under the expressed stipulation
th;tt it was to he used for wharfage for
the club's b^ats and must be used by
the club exclusively. It has been ru
mored for some time that the club was
in financial d!ptr'--ss. it is stated that
this condition contributed to the suc
cess of th" deal co cleverly manipu
lated.
The entire landed interests of the
Catalina Yacht Club were yesterday
transferred for $5000 to N. J. Foster,
heavy acreage of Egyptian corn will be
planted this year. Beet growing is being
tried iSerely as an experiment, a few
acres being planted in various parts of
the county. The whole will aggregate not
more than 100 acres.
KINGS COUNTY.
HANFCVRD. April 18.â The acreage in
grain in Kings County this year is double
that of last year. It is thought the yield
will not be much greater, as the crop on
tlic lak" land is almost a failure. All
kinds of fruit show an enormous yield.
except .apricots, which were injured by
frost. Prunes, peaches and pears will
give a larger yield than last year. Raisins
promise an extraordinarily big yield.
TULARE COUNTY.
VIS ALT A, April 18.â The increased acre
age of grain in Tulare County over that
of last year is about 3000 acres: the in
creased acreage of fruit. 5550 acres, most
ly in peaches and prunes and citrus fruits.
No sugar beets are grown in this county.
The increased yield of fruit per acre over
list year will be 400 per cent, or about
ll!0o carloads.
KERN COUNTY.
BAKERSFIEL.D, April 18.âConserva
tive judges place Kern's grain crop at
one-half. This takes in Irrigated and un
irrigated lands. The Kern County Land
Company, the largest growers, say ltd
acreage "is about 15 per ceni below last
year. Miller & Lux report 50 per cent less.
Unirrigated lands are about the same as
last year. On some dry land wheat is fair
and on some a total failure. Rain within
a few days would help late grain. The
fruit is the best it has been in several
years. The lange i 3 very line, and the
stork industry, the largest of all In Kern,
is prosperoua The fruit acreage is the
, as last year.
CONTRA COSTA COUNTY.
MARTINEZ. April IS.â The estimated
acreage of different kinds of grain can
not be had, but from reports from all sec
tions of the county the amount of grain
sown is very large, and the crops prom
ise to be the heaviest In many years. This
year hundreds of acres of fruit and vines
come into bearing. The sugar beet yield
will he double that of the previous year.
Every patch of .land in the county that
could be plowed Is in grain. It will be the
most prosperous season in recent years.
NAPA COUNTY.
NAI'A, April 17.â The Call correspond
ent Interviewed 11. M. Meacham, Kapa
County's As.se.sHor, as to the increased
.â â¢â¢ <if cereals In the county. Mr.
Meacham said the grain acreage had
greatly increased this year. There was
no increase In sugar beets. All crops are
i:i excellent condition.
SONOMA COUNTY.
SANTA ROSA. April IS.â This promises
to be the best year in the blÃtory of So
noma County. The actual acreage in cul
tivation last season was 861.22 L This year
it will easily reach the 900,000 mark. Con
servative estlmati s place the Increased
; rouge for the present season over that
of last as follows^, Jl:iy and grain.
oats, T^i; ba,rley, 2.">0; corn. 200; olives, 50;
apples, 2uo; apricots, 10; cherries, 15;
peaches, 250; pears, 50; prunes, 600; wal
nuts, 100. Roughly spt iikin". ii is thought
that taking everything Into consideration
the it In the number of acres
planted this year will exceed that of last
by about 10 per cent. Most of the new
apples ari oui In the neighbor
hot " "i' Fort Ross and the northern coast
sections. Considerable talk is heard re
garding the planting of sugar beets In the
neighborhood of Bloomfield and Valley
Ford, where potatoes have, been a great
Btaple heretofore. The raising of t
beets has never been undertaken exten
sively here, owing to the fact that no
market was available. It is believed that
the Increased yieid per acre over that of
last year can safely be placed at about 10
per cent, except in prunes. The approxi
mate acreage of the principal products
: in this county last year was as fol
lows: Wheat, 9000; "^i*. 7850; barley. 3100;
corn, 950; hay, 39,850; olives, 400; apples,
2000; apricots. 200; cherries, 860; peaches,
2500; pears, 1300; prunes, 57U0; walnuts, 400;
grapes, 14,000.
MARIN COUNTY.
SAN RAFAEL, April 18.â The potatoes
for which Marin County is famous are
likely soon to become a memory, as their
cultivation will be superseded by that of
BUgar beets. The soil and the climate in
the region 'if Tomales are especially fa
vorable to this important Industry, and
t lie farmers have been encouraged by the
sugar companies to begin the culture of
bei ta on a large scale. Owing to the re
ceni rains the grass crops throughout the
count v will be excellent this year and the
dairymen look for a good annual income
on their investments.
LAKE COUNTY.
I.AKEPORT. April 18.â According to a
conservative estimate the Increased acre
age in the fruits and cereals will be as
follows: Wheat. 5000: oats, con; barley,
2000; corn, 150; hay, 100. No new orchards
have been set out this year. About 700
acres of prunes have come into bearing
this year. There were splendid crops in
Lake County last year and the prospects
are excellent for a much larger yield this
year. ; ; ;
SACRAMENTO COUNTY.
SACRAMENTO, April is.â This year
Sacramento County will realize twice the
crop of last year in cereals. Sugar-beet
who is said to be acting for the South
â¢in Pacific. This win give that cor
poration the long-sought-for entrance.
Residents of thi- town denounce in
unmeasured terms the action of a small
element In the Yacht Club that aided in
engineering this deal. They propose
to contest the transfer with vigor, and
are confident Huntington will fail in
this scheme as ignomlniourty as he did
in the effort to drag the harbor away
.from San Pedro. The true inwardness
of the transaction crops out to-night,
as leading spirits of thi; yacht club de
clare that neither the question nor the
details of the sale were submitted to
the stockholders as a body and that
the action of the directors in sanction
ing the deal was irregular.
President J. M. Elliott of the First
National Bank, a member of the club,
says he has received no notice of the
transaction and that at the annual din
ner, held since the meeting at which
the sale is supposed to have been au
thorized, no mention was made of the
plan. F. K. Rule, also a stockholder,
denies having received notice of the
meeting.
While denials nre emphatic, it is as
serted the whole plan was skillfully
manipulated by attorneys, who. have
deftly handled the intricacies of the
situation and that nothing can prevent
growing has npt been fully exploited yet,
but the handsome profit of Samuel Lav
eneon in the culture of the beet in down
river lands has encouraged others to try
the experiment, with a certainty of suc
cess. George B. Katzenstein, manager
of the Earl Fruit Company and an au
thority on fruits, said to-night that this
year fully 200 additional acres of orange
trees will be planted, and 500 acres of de
ciduous fruits, pears, plums, apricots and
grapes. Cherries and apricots are some
what short, but the yield of other fruits
will be greatly in excess of last year. Re
cent continued rains set back some fruit
by washing out pollen, preventing fertil
ization, but other blossoms came out,
and. generally speaking, the prospects are
favorable for very large crops. The prin
cipal new acreage is in the line of citrus
fruits.
GLENN COUNTY.
WILLOWS, April 18.â The Call corre
spondent interviewed prominent farmers
from all sections of the county to-day,
and all said there never had been such
a j:ijod prospect for a full crop of wheat
and barley. There is no doubt that this
year's crop will be double that of last
year. Very few sections in this part of
the valley need rain, and a full crop is
assured. There is 50 per cent more acre
age this year than ever before.
YOLO COUNTY.
WOODLAND, April 18.â The increase in
fruit acreage is small. Crops ifery from
one-half to double the yield of last year.
There is a material increase in the wheat
acreage, due to the favorable season, in
both the uplands and the tule districts.
Tf Yolo County has. the usual spring show
ers the yield will be doubled. The alfalfa
crop is very large. There are no sugar
beets in this county.
SHASTA COUNTY.
REDDING. April 18.â The increased
acreage in, Shasta County over that of
last year will cut but little figure. This
county does not begin to raise enough of
any one staple, to supply the home mar
ket, as thousands of tons of hay, grain,
flour and potatoes are annually Imported.
SUTTER COUNTY.
YUBA CITY, April IS.â The crop pros
pects for Sutter County were never more
encouraging. Pears, cherries, apricots
and almonds will almost equal a full crop.
I 'caches will reach the average", as will
other varieties of fruit. The summer fal
low crops arc doing splendidly. Winter
sown grain and wheat are in need of rain,
as the ground seems hard on top. al
though finite moist below the surfacfe.
TEHAMA COUNTY-
RED BLUFF, April 18.â Fruit and grain
prospects in Tehama County could not be
1 < tter at this time. The acreage of fruit
will be about the same as last year, while
that of grain probably will be 20 per cent
less. The yield of grain will be from 50 to
100 per cent greater than last year.
YUBA COUNTY.
MARYSVII.I.K. April 18.â In Yuba
County, where the crops never fail, there
will not be a notabje increase in the
acreage this year. This Is owing to the
fact that the season of ISPS, following
a comparatively poor year In 1897, found
every available piece of soil in the county
tilled in one way <>r another. LasJ Beasor
the acreage sown to wheat, barley and
oats was in round numbers 43.000, 15.000 and
4111M1. respectively. As to the Increased
yield per acre, it is yet too early to make
an estimate. There will be very little
difference. Pears and almonds are in
clined to be poor, but other fruits will be
above the average. There are no sugar
In Yuba.
BUTTE COUNTY.
OROVILLB, April IS.â The incrensed
piain acreage in Butte County over last
year is over 25 to 30 per cent. This holds
true of both wheat and barley. There is
not over 5 per cent increase in the acre
age of fruit â that is. new fruit coming
into bearing. The crop of all kinds of
deciduous fruits, except apricots, will be
from 25 to 40 per cent greater than last
year. The orange trees are heavily laden
v.ith bloom this spring, but it is too early
t < > tell how the crop of oranges and olives
will come out The hay crop will be con-
Bid* rably greater than last season.
Â»
SIERRA COUNTY.
STEIUIAVILLE. April IS.â Last year
Sierra Valley produced 80,000 bushels of
grain, principally barley. This year, with
a slight increase of perhaps 1000 acres, the
output may reach 130,000 bushels. The
principal crop. In this valley is hay. From
present indications the hay crop will not
exceed that of last year, as there is but
little snow on the mountains and there
will be a shortage of water f>>r irrigation.
EL DORADO COUNTY.
PLACKRVILJ/E, April 18.â There is a
greatly increased acreage In grain in this
county this year. There are excellent
prospects for a heavy crop, principally
oats and barley. Nearly all will be cut
for hay. Owing to the destruction of the
El Dorado flouring mills by fire but little
grain will be harvested. There is every
indication of a splendid fruit crop.

SAN RAFAEL'S MARRIAGE
BUREAU IN A. FUROR
SAX RAFAEL, April 18.â The little 1
bronze cupid on County Clerk Graham's
desk tumbled off its perch and lost its
hi ad completely to-day, speaking in a
Strictly literal sense, as the result of a
long-expected passage at arms between
Justice George Rodden and City Recorder
Edwin Gardner. For many moons these
dignified wearers of the ermine have been
at daggers' points over the right of
Gardner to officiate at marriage ceremo
nies. The quarrel culminated to-day in
a personal encounter, which, for a brief
period, threw the courthouse into an up
roar.
George Trenouth of Mission San Jose
procured a license to marry Miss Mamie
Bolton of the same place, and Gardner
was to officiate at the nuptials. Rodden
came into the Clerk's office in time to ex
postulate and explain to the intended
groom that the marriage would be illegal.
He Bna.tch.ed the marriage certificate and
In so doing caused woe Cupid's downfall.
Hot words passed between the two.
Gardner rushed upstairs to consult Dis
trict Attorney Hcls&ac, closely followed
by Rodden. As Gardner entered the
stock of fruit trees is exhausted this â¦
early in the season. Peaches seemed to i>
be most in demand. It is estimated that i
1000 acres of new orchards have been J
planted, mostly in small lots. As to grain. -^
the acreage will fall considerably below f
that of last year, as nearly half is volun- f
teer. Last season there was about 20,000 4>
acres of wheat. Barley and oats cut a I
small figure in this county. T

NEVADA COUNTY. t
NEVADA, April 18.â This year's In- 1
crease In the acreage of wheat and oats I
planted In Nevada County â will not ex
oeed last year's by over 10 per cent.
Present indications are the yield per acre
in tlii-se grains, as well as corn and bar
ley, will be about the largest ever known
in the county, and not less than 50 per
cent greater than last year's. One or two
warm rainstorms within a fortnight
would insure phenomenal returns. Enor
are assured, provided no Late killing
frosts come.
PLUMAS COUNTY.
QUINCT, April 18.â Plumas County has
a slight increase in the acreage of wheat,
oats and barley. Crops promise to be one
half larger than last year.
MODOC COUNTY.
ALTURAS. April IS.â The present
season promises to surpass all previous
ones in the acreage and yield of grain.
Careful estimates place the increased
acreage at 20 per cent over last year. Tha
prine.pal increase will be In wheat and
barley. Fruit promises a large yield, es
pecially in apples, pears, prunes and
plums. The weather is warm, with an
occasional shower, and vegttation is
growing rapidly.
LASSEN COUNTY.
SUSANVILLE, April 18.-There has
been no appreciable increase in the acre
age sown to wheat in Lassen County this
year, but present indications point to
rather more than an average yield. Sugar
beets are grown only as a farm crop and
seem to be growing in favor as food for
stock. Some small orchards have been
planted, compensating for the loss
through death and disease of old trees.
The grass and hay crops are looking well,
and in Honey Lake and Big valleys the
acreage sown to alfalfa has been in
creased 200 acres or more.
â J-
AMADOR COUNTY.
JACKSOX, April 17.â The increased
acreage in Amador County is from 10 to
13 per cent. The yield will exceed last
year's as follows: Barley, 50 per cent;
wheat, 36; hay, 50: peaches, 65: pears, 20;
apples 25; prunes. 30: grapes, 25; potatoes,
â 10. This estimate is subject to the usual
.spring rains and light frosts.
MENDOCINO COUNTY.
URIAH, April 17.â Taking into consid
eration the fact that what have hereto
fore been hop fields will in several in
stances be planted in grain, and grain
fields in fruit, the acreage in all kinds of
grain this year will be about the same as
last year. Owing to bounteous rains the
acreage will yield probably 15 per cent
better than last year.
SOLANO COUNTY.
SUISUN, April 18.â The acreage of
grain sown this year is the greatest in
the history of Solano County, and all
kinds, with the exception of some in
i>lh :ea that was seeded late, is looking
most promising. From present indi
cations summer fallowed wheat will yield
from nine to twelve sacks per acre,
against four to seven last year, with
more than double the acreage. There will
be an unusual crop of hay. Barley al
ready is heading out. Present indications
point to a large crop of pears, peaches
and almonds. The yield of other varie
ties of fruit will be much smaller than
last year. Cherries are very short.
There will be the largest crop of almonds
in several years.
HUMBOLDT COUNTY.
EUREKA, April 18.â The acreage is
about the same as last year. There will
be a probable Increase in oats of 10 per
cent. Fruit promises well, principally ap
ples for export. The increase over last
season, if any, will be in new bearing or
chards. Weather conditions here almost
uniformly insure average crops. There is
always plenty of rain. Feed is particular
ly good.
CALAVERAS COUNTY.
SAX ANDREAS, April 17.â With the ex
pectatlon of April showers Calaveras
County will give to the State a greatly in
creased production in grain and hay. The
late rains have brightened the prospects.
Most of the grain will be cut for hay.
Apples, peaches, grapes and almonds look
promising. No sugar beets are raised here.
The acreage will be about double that
of last year.
DEL NORTE COUNTY.
CRESCKNT CITY. April 18. â This
county is not important in grain or
fruit products. None are raised for ox
port. The crop'prospects are better than
last year.
MONO COUNTY.
BODIE, April IS.â Crops in Mono County
will be entirely up to the standard. The
acreage has had little or no increase. The
sugar beet crop will be about the same as
hist year. Owing to the large quantity of
snow in the mountains the grain and po
tato crop will be larger than usual.

Tn the meantime Miss Bolton had quit
ted the scene and gone to Rev, Father

against Gardner, but the girl refused to

PASSENGER TRAIN
JUMPS THE TRUCK
Railway Disaster Near
Niles.
Special Dispatoh to The Call.
NILES, April 18.â Train No. 32, with
the overland passengers from Sacra
mento and southern points, in charge
of Conductor McEntyre, Engineer
Ahean and Fireman Thompson, jumped
the track two miles east of Midway
at 1:25 o'clock this afternoon. No lives
were lost, but the trainmen had a mar
vflous escape.
The tender left the rails on an up
hrtl curve while running at a rate of
thirty miles an hour. The air-hose was
cut and the engineer could not control
the train. It ran its length before
stopping and dragged the mail car off.
The tender was demolished and the
fireman's escape seems almost incredi
ble. He was with Engineer Harry Hub
bard when the latter was killed in Alta
mont tunnel, four years ago, and be
lieves that he bears a charmed life.
The passenger coaches and mail car
of the wrecked train were taken back
to Tracy and sent in via Mardnez.
The San Jose local, which connects
with this train at Niles, was run to
Livermore as extra, returning to Niles
to connect with the 4:30 local. The in
coming evening Stockton train with
the southern coast passengers was sent
via Martinez, connecting at the Oak
land pier with the last Haywards local,
which ran to San Jose as an extra. The
out-going Stockton train leaving tha
pier at 5 o'clock with all east-of-Liver
more passengers, was sent via Marti
nez, â¢while an extra was made up to
carry the local passengers to Liver
more. This returned as a local later
in the evening.
The wrecking crew reported the track
clear at 9:15 to-night and returned to
Oakland.
LIQUOR FAMINE
ON THE YUKON
Consignments Stopped
at Skaguay.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SKAGUAY, Afjril 14, via Seattle,
April 18.â The action of Deputy United
States 'Collector of Custums Andrews
in holding all liquors for the interior
here and refusing to forward them by
convoys so long as the Canadian offi
cials insist on stopping- American offi
cers at the summit has caused an ac
cumulation in the bonded warehouse
until to-day there' are nearly one hun
dred tons of liquors of all kinds await
ing the action of the Secretary of the
Interior on Mr. Andrews' letter asking
for instructions. In the meantime a
liquor famine is threatened at Atlin,
Log Cabin and Bennett, and smugglers
are making big money by getting past
the American customs officers.
There is a strained feeling toward the
Canadian officials as the result of their
arbitrary assumption of the summit as
the boundary line, and it would not
take much to create ah open demon
stration and a resort to arms should
the Canadians attempt further en
croachment on American territory.
While there was no truth in the report
ed battle between miners and mounted
police on the boundary line in the
Porcupine district, it is said a forward
movement was contemplated by the
Canadians and all arrangements had
been perfected to move the boundary
line far enough toward the coast to em
brace the rich diggings of the Porcu
pine River.
The miners there, numbering about
700, had a few determined leaders.
Word was sent to the mounted police
that their attempt to encroach on
American territory would result in
bloodshed. As the Americans are in
the majority the Canadians reconsid
ered their intention.
A corresponding move from the sum
mit to Skaguay was planned and it is
the knowledge of these contemplated
movements th:.t has aroused a feeling
of antagonism here against the Cana
dians that will yet resuit in serious
trouble if the boundary question be not
settled soon. Every American here
feels that he has been neglected and
left unprotected by the Government at
Washington and this has added to the
bitterness of feeling, which was inten
sified to a dangerous point when the
news came that the Government con
templated giving the Canadians a port
in Lynn canal.

MAY HEMPSTEAD
STILL UNBEATEN
Captures the Tennessee
Derby.
Special Pispat-h to The Call.
MEMPHIS. April 18.â Under fair
skies and on a fast track Messrs. Hed
ley and Norton's unbeaten mare, May
Hempstead. won the Tennessee Derby
at Montgomery Park this afternoon in
a gallop from Chancery and Leo Plan
ter. The gallant daughter of Patron-
Lily Hempstead was -a decided favorite
in the betting. Perhaps the largest
attendance ever known at Montgomery
Park gathered to see the race and at
4 o'clock, just before the Derby field
went to the post, it was estimated that
fully 15.000 persons were present. In
last' night's entries only three horses
were carded to start, but at the last
moment Chancery was added, iking
a field of four to contest for the rich
prize.
The horses were started promptly,
with May Hempstead live lengths to
the rear. The little mare immediately
raced to the front and never re
linquished her lead. Turner held her
in gentle restraint all down the back
stretch and won without effort by three
lengths. The fight for second money
was a spirited one, Chancery, well rid
den-by T. Murphy, beating Leo Planter
a nose for that position. The Kentuck
ian the second choice, was never prom
inent. The gross value of the Derby
was $7060. of which the winner received
$6310, the second horse $500 and the
third ?250.
In the third race owner and jockey

MAN OR WOMAN MAY PRESENT A
hale, hearty appearance, and yet behind |
all this disease may be slowly and surely mak-
ing. Inroads upon the constitution. Attain, man
or woman may present a healthy exterior, and
yet be compelled to endure groat suffering:.
Rheumatism is the disease that works its
way insidiously into the human system. It
spares neither the rich nor the poor. It may
attack the strong as well as the wÂ»ak. Woman
must suffer as well as man. The pain may bo
slight or It may ha severe. It may be confined !
to the shoulder 'Fig. 1). the back (Fig 3), the
hip*- 'Fig. 4), or the extremities (Figs. 5-6).
Again, it may affect the Joints only, or the
muscles only. The heart (Fig. 2) sooner or
later becomes affected in all cases, a d thus
may be seen the importance of proper treatment
JuÃt as Boon as possible. It ia very necessary
to relieve the pain and suffering, hut It is more
necessary to counteract and expel from the
system those irritating acids that are the dl-
rect cause of this disease, and that finally re-
sult In serious heart lesions.
Hudyan will relieve the pain by neutralizing
the acldÃ and expelling them from the blood.
Thus Hudyan will prevent and cure rheuma-
l\tm and heart disease as well.
These acids must be expelled- throujrh the
kidneys and pores of the skin. The great Hud-
yan remedy will strengthen and Increase the
activity of the kidneys for this extra work, and
will also stimulate the general circulation and
open the pores, so the rheumatic virus may
pass away throunrh both these channels. In the
ourse of rheumatic disease complications very
often arise, such as Stomach troubles, Nervous
dineasp. Liver or Kidney diseases. We have
already made mention of the Heart complica-
tion. Hii'lv.m, by means of Its peculiar cura-
tive powers, reaches every nerve and fiber In
the human organism, therefore it will cure
these complications as well.
You need not suffer from rheumatism, for
Hudyan in the infallible remedy. Come to pur.
offices and read the testimony of those who
have been cured by Hudyan. There Is no bet-
ter evidence than that of people who have been
cured.
Hudyan is for sale by druggists, or it will be
tent direct, upon receipt of priceâ a pack-
age, or six packages for $2 60.

Friedlander tor a term of ten years, with
a privilege of renewal at the expiration
of that time for a similar period. The
plans for the building have not been defi
nitely decided upon, and it Is probable
that in architect, an expert in theater
truction, will come from the East to
take charge of this Important branch of
the work.
The general plan of the new theater has
iipt-ii outlined, however. The first two
stories and the basement are i
pled by the theater, and th, upper I
will lie used as offices and quarters will
be prepan <i for one or more of the bi^;
clubs of the pity. It will be a substantial
structure of brick, Stone and iron, and:
when completed will, together with the
land, represent an Investment of over
(400,000. Negotiations between Messrs.

way for some tima and matters have been
â  such shape by the signing of the
rday that the new play-:
house is a certainty.
Work on til-' building will be begun just â 
as soon as the plans ran b< pr< pi ;â¢> d and

Grand Opera- House
The Southwell Opera Company met with
the greatest success of its season Mon
day night at the Grand In "Ermlnie." The
production was elaborate and the scenery
and costumes were novel and picturesque.
All the principals appeared together for
the first time, making the cast the St
. yet presented. Miss, Edith Mason
was a charming Erminie and carried off
tli.- chief musical honors. She was en
cored three times for her lullaby in the
d act. Thomas H. Persse sang the
I f Eugene admirably, and William
Wolff and Arthur WooleV made hits re
spectively as Ravenee and "Caddy." The
Her de Brabon showed Mlro Dela
matta to greater advantage than any
thing he "had hitherto been seen in. Hattie
Ladd Bcored as Javotte and Eleanor
Gulstl was a very dainty and attractive
â¢ '.j;.T.tii. le Launey. The chorus acquit

â¢ audience would never tire of the
gavotte in the second act so often was it
manded.

ami admiring throng .Monday night in
Metropolitan Temple. The pictures pop-
BeÃÃ more than ordinary Interest, both for
their < k< â¢ H< nee and historical significant â â 
as well aÂ« for their novelty, being the
firs) biograph ever taken of a Pope and
the first time in eipht years that the holy
father has sat before a photographic
camera.
The disposition of the light and the
management of the apparatus at the time
the views were taken could not have been
Improved upon, and the result has been a I
series of mutoscope views thai have never |
been surpassed.
The virus of the Pontiff walking and |

BILLIONS ON PAPER,
BUT TENS IN .SIGHT
PLANS OF A PROMOTER TO
CONTROL EVERYTHING.
An Oaklander Starts Out to Outdo
Hooley in the Matter of Big
Schemes.
Articles of incorporation of two com
j panics having, it is thought, the object
in view of controlling the universe, were
tiled in the office of the County Clerk
yesterday. The first articles to go on rec
ord were those of the Globe Fiscal Com
whieh modestly set forth the capi-'
t.il sleek ;is $2,00 ,000. Of this amount
1,600 has been subscribed. Director
A. R. Kxley of Oakland holds stock
valued at (200,000,000, while J6OO is sub
si ril'cl by the other direc.tt'isâ Alexander
Thompson, Robert Brand, T. Byron de
: Witt, E. J. Berg, E. K. Darrin and J. F.
Pfetch.
The same gentlemen appear as subscrib
ers and directors in the second corpora
tion, which will be known as the interna
tional Coal Company. This corporation Is
not as pretentious as the other, the capi
tal stock being but $500,000,000. ' Mr. Exley '
of Oakland has subscribed $50,000,000 of ;
this amount, the other directors named
advancing $10 each.
"So the figures that we use in forming
our companies have caused some sur
prise?" said A. K. Exley, president Of the
Globe Fiscal Company and of the Inter
national Coal Company, and of three
other companies to be incorporated within
a few days. "The Fiscal is capitalized for
two billions, but 1 am satisfied that we ;
shall have to Increase it to five before !
long. We have bonded coal mines in the \
north, have options In Pennsylvania and
will have offices In Hongkong and Eng- ;
land. Our plans cannot fail, tor some of
the biggest men of the country are back j
of us. I cannot divulge my plans now. :
but must keep something un my sleeve for
a time. It is not wise, you know, when 1
you deal in billions, to say too much. I
have three more companies almost start- |
cd. They will be capitalized highâ per- |
naps live hundred millions apieceâ 1;
shall be president of them all. These five
companies are like the fingers of a hand,
and I tell you whatever they touch will:
stick to them.
"I was one of the promoters of the
Hercules Wave Motor Company, and
there will be nloney In it yet. It is gen
uine, and my WOO shares will be worth
$100 apiece when the thing Is at work.
Everybody laughs at new things, but I
tell you we are winners.
"Hooley? I can out-promote Hooley
and not go smash In the end like he did.
He was a fool. :He 'gave much money
away. I would never give away a dollar,
but will run all my propositions on. their j
merits. With my experience in thÂ« coal
and insurance business and my English
methods of doing business we shall make
some of these fin-de-siecle capitalists
shake, 1 tell you. 1 wrote to a San Fran
cisco millionaire recently offering to let
him in on the ground floor, but he de
clined an interview. He will regret it
yet. When I open a San Francisco office
1 shall let him know and tell him we shall
bo glad to Bee him if he will call around.
There are some surprises in store to be
revealed before the century closes, don't
you know. Many of these directors are
only dummies, and will give way to pow
erful men at the rig lit time. Till then
the people of Oakland and San Francisco
must wait for the disclosure of our
plans." W&OJBm

ter of Paul Pidge, receiver for the
Sutter Street Railway Company, died
â  . st. rday afternoon from acute inflamma
tion oT the bowels, superinduced by eat
iiif,' poisonous tomatoes. Mr. Pidge's two
year-old son is also hovering between life
and death from the same cause.
A week ago Sunday canned tomatoes
were served for dinner at the Pidgo home
on Polk street, and the whole family
partook of them. The next day Norris,
the little boy, was taken sick, and it. < >.
W. Jones, who was called in. treated him
for Inflammation of the bowels, but did
not know what was the cause of the
trouble. on Sunday tomatoes were again
served, and on Monday the little siirl was
taken ill. Despite all that could he done
for her she sank rapidly and died yester
day afternoon.
The case -was reported at the Morgue
and Coroner Hill made an investigation,

posed that the natural acids of the toma

INTENSE SUFFERING
FROM DYSPEPSIA AND STOMACH
TROUBLE
Instantly Relieved and Perma-
nently Cured by Stuart's :
Dyspepsia Tablets.
A New Discovery, but Not a
Patent Medicine.
Dr. Redwell relates an interesting ac-
count of what he considers a remarkable
cure of acute stomach trouble and chron-
ic dyspepsia by the u.Â«e of the new dis-
covery. Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets.
He says: "The patient was a man who
had suffered to my knowledge for years
with dyspepsia. Everything he ate seemed
to sour and create gases in the stomach;
he had pains like rheumatism in the back,
shoulder blades and limbs, fullness and
distress after eating, poor appetite and
loss of flesh; the heart became affected,
causing palpitation and sleeplessness at
night.
I gave him powerful nerve tonics and.
blood remedies, but to no purpose. As an
experiment I finally bought a fifty-cent
package of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets at
a drug store and gave them to him. Al-
most immediate relief was given and after
he had used four boxes he was to all ap-
pearances fully cured.
There was no more acidity or sour wa-
tery risings, no bloating after meals, the
appetite was vigorous and he has gained
between 10 and 12 pounds in weight of
solid, healthy flesh.
Although Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are
advertised and sold in drug stores, yet. I
consider them a most valuable addition
to any physician's line of remedies, as
they are perfectly harmless, and can be
given to children or invalids or in any
condition of the stomach with perfect
safety, being harmless and containing
| nothing but fruit and vegetable essences,
S pure pepsin and Golden Seal.
Without any question they are the
safest, most effective cure for indigestion,
biliousness, constipation and all derange-
ments of the stomach, however slight or
severe."
Stuart's dyspepsia Tablets are made by
the F. A. Stuart Co. cf Marshall, Mich.,
and are sold by druggists everywhere at
fifty cents per package.

A CORPORAL'S GUARD BUSY
WHALER HORATIO WR-ECKED IN
THE CAROLINES.
The Morgan City Will Take "a
Happy Family" in the Engine-
Room â Ships Adrift in
the Bay.
The United States transport Warren
(Scandia) will leave for Manila at an
early hour this morning. She was to have
eail.nl yesterday afternoon, but the sol
diers who were to go on her had not all
arrived. Her full list will consist of SOO
officers and men from the artillery and
600 recruits for the various regiments In
the Philippines. About a thousand of
these men were put aboard the transport
early in the day, but as they were given
shore leave they might as well have been
allowed to find their own way aboard in
the first place. The saloon on Easi street
near Folsom were crowded during the af
ternoon and free fights were almost con
tinuous. A large force of men from the
Harbor police and a corporal's guard
were on hand and as soon as a soldier be
came too obstreperous he was bundled
aboard and locked up.
The Hancock, which was scheduled to
Ball on Monday night, did not get away
until early yesterday morning. She will
roach Honolulu about thirty-six hours
ahead of the Warren and should be coaled
and ready to sail by the time the latter
arrives. Â.,.,
The Morgan City and the Newport were
to follow the Warren next Friday. The
Newport will probably get away, but the
chances are that the Morgan City will not
leave before Tuesday next. Her machin
ery requires considerable overhauling and
the work cannot be finished by Friday
next. The Morgan City will go out with
a "happy family" in the engine-room.
When the transport made port all the
odium of the firemen's strike was put
upon First Assistant Engineer L. N.
Gre.-n. It now transpires that Green was
in reality the peucAnaker and patched up
the differences of the men. Everything
has been adjusted and Chief Engineer W.
11. Kelley, First Assistant 1.. N. Green,
Second Assistant S. M. B â â  le, Third As
sistant B. Gorman and nearly all the
oilers, firemen and coal passers who came
In on the vessel will go out on her again.
It is said that a new captain will sail in
command, as Captain Dillon will resign.
Intelligence was received yesterday of
the wreck of the whaling bark Horatio at
Port Lotin. in one of the Islands of the
Caroline group. The captain and crew
were picked up by the barkentlne Ruth
nnd will be light to this city. The Ho

of different styles of trusses, but as they only

In Adams, N. v.. a well-known specialist of

pletely as to Rive no sign that there ever had
been a rupture. As it was n. bad .is.- and a

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1899.
POLICE INVESTIGATE
FLEISHMAN'S CHARGES
COMPLAINT OF A NOE VALLEY
FAMILY AGAINST HOODLUMS.
Reports of Officers Who Were De
tailed to Examine Into the Al
leged Persecution.
The police under Captain Gillen have
been investigating' the charges of per
secution at the hands of a gang of young
hoodlums, made by David Fleishman of
ill Jersey street, and published in last
Thursday's Call. Fleishman had also re
ported the matter to Secretary Holbrook,
who has since been conducting an Inves
tigation on his own account.
Sergeant "Scotty" Campbell, one of the
officers Bent out to investigate, report
ed in part as follows:
in talking with Fleishman I learned that
some of the acts complained of occurred as far
back as last July. I afterward visited tome of
the bouses of the boys mentioned in the re
port. I saw Mrs. Grove and her two sons.
She la a. widow and her boys are hard work
ingâone of them in a planing mill and the
other in a foundry- The boys told me that
Fleishman accused them of setting oft .the can
non last July, and they denied it, claiming
they had nothing to do with it, and they have
not si>oken to him since that time, which
Fleishman admits. I interviewed the Smith
boy and his father, and they indignantly deny
that the Smith boy had anything to do with
the firing of the cannon and never annoyed
Fleishman, In any way.
Sergeant C F. Blank, another of those
who interviewed Fleishman, reported:
Mrs. Crouse, 117 Jersey street, states she
never saw hoodlums in the neighborhood an
noying any one. Mrs. Holloway, 1352 Church;
Mrs. Crowley, 118 Jersey; Mrs. Coogan, 122
Jersey: Mrs. Jackalizza. 1250 Church; Mr.
Duffy, 1211 Church, all make the same state
ments. In regard to the cat, dogs and cow
being shot, I failed to find any marks of the
same. 1 fourtd one window broken, which he
states was done when McKinley was elected
President. On the 3d of July, IbSS, the boys of
the neighborhood made a small cannon out of
gas pipe to celebrate the 4th of July; it ex
rloded, and Dave Fleishman took it away from
them, being afraid of getting shot by the can
non.
Officer E. J. Thompson submitted this
report: %
About two months ago I received instructions
from you to call at David Fleishman's resi
dence in reference to a complaint about boya
annoying htm and his family. I made in
quiry of some of the neighbors, and was told
they had never noticed any one bothering the
family. I also mad.- passing calls, but failed
to find any boys or young men annoying them
in any way. I also received orders from you
about April 7 to make investigation about
another complaint received by you from the
Fleishmans. I called there and saw Mrs.
Fleishman, and she said they had been an
noyed by boys with air guns. I asked her if
she knew the boys and she said she did not;
that they seemed to be boys passing by at the
time they were using the air guns. I again
interviewed some of the neighbors, and was
told by them that they had seen no boys around
with air guns, or boys annoying the Fleish
man family. I will continue to make fre
quent passing calls on the second and third
watches.
Officer Nyhan reported as follows:
Regarding paragraph in The Call referring
to D. Fleishman, would say that on or about
July 4, 189S, Fleishman complained to me
thai boys were shooting off firecrackers around
his residence; also that boys broke a- pan of
glass. At that time there were a number of
boys coming along Jersey street, and Fleish
man pointed to one of the largest of them, say-
Ing he was one of the boys who were an
noying him. I placed him under arrest and
brought him to Mr. Fleishman for identifica
tion. The boy pleaded innocence,- and at
Fleishman's request I released him and cauÂ»
Lioned the boy to keep away from that place.
I have made passing calls around that place,
and have failed to find any one annoying them
since or before that time.
Officer A. 1.. Folsom made this report
to Captain Gillen:
Acting under your Instructions. I made an
Investigation In reference to my boy being de
tailed by Mrs. Holbrook to watch and see if
any boys were shooting at D. Fleishman's
cows chickens or cats. I wish to state that
the boy belongs to an order called the Band
of Mercy, gotten up by Mrs. Holbrook for the
prevention of cruelty to animals, and that my
boy, Arthur Folsom, age 11, was acting under
her Instructions and detailed by Mrs. Hol
brook without my knowledge or consent to
watch the said Fleishman's place for two
afternoons, in company with another boy by

BUYERS SEEK
REAL ESTATE
INVESTMENTS
Confidence in San
Francisco's Future.
STOCKS ARE SECOND CHOICE
MANY GOOD SIZED DEALS ABE
BEING NEGOTIATED.
Eastern Capitalists Looking to the
Metropolis of the Pacific as
the Coming Center of
Business.
San Francisco real estate continues
firm and active, with increasing pros
pects of still greater improvement. This
statement is true, notwithstanding the
fact that the sales for the past week fell
somewhat below those of the preceding
weeks. There are more prospective buy
ers in the market than for some time
past, and almost every real estate firm
in the city has deals under way involving
big sums, any one of which may be con
summated at an early date. Money is
plentiful and investors are seeking to put
out their unemployed capital where it
will bring in the largest returns. There
is a decided tendency to neglect stocks,
which have heretofore been a favored
field for speculation for the more sub
stantial and safer investment in income
producing realty.
The recent rains, which washed away
all fear of a devastating drought
throughout the State, had much to do
with the feeling of confidence that now
prevails among all classes in California,
but this does not account for the flatter-
Ing attention with which San Francisco
is at present being honored by the capl-
talists of the East. The recent announce
ment that two big transcontinental rail
roads were actively preparing to extend
their lines to this city and enter into ac
tive competition with the Southern Pa
cific caused a general awakening to the
future in store for the metropolis of the
Pacific, but the overshadowing cause of
the sudden turning of the searchlight of
capital on this city, and that which prob
ably had also much to do with hurrying
the plans of the railroad magnates, Is the
absolute certainty that San Francisco, as
the natural gateway to the Orient, is
about to enter upon an era of unparal
leled commercial prosperity, 'mis asser
tion is borne out by the big demand for
property in the wholesale district, prefer
ence being given to sites convenient to
tin- water front. The announcement a
few days ago of a number of big transfers
in that section was about the first inti
mation the general public had of the
dawn of the new era, and even now many
are inclined to think that the movement
toward the water front lias spent Itself;
but this Is by no means the fact. Nego
tiations an- still pending for desirable
warenouse property, and the great firms
of the East have already begun to make
arrangements to make shipments to As
iatic ports direct from San Francisco.
keeping warehouses stocked with goods
here. Instead of simply maintaining
agents here, as has been the practice
heretofore.
But real estate activity is not confined
to the wholesale district. The entire city
is receiving the benefit of the revival of
confidence and sales are being made daily
in every section of the municipality. One
of the largest sales reported for the past
week was one made by Mrs. Amy Lander
to Mrs. Jennie Otto of the property at
the southeast corner of Twenty-second
and Howard .streets, consisting of lot lOOz
216 feet, with ten Hats. The price paid
was $31,500, and the negotiations wire
conducted by Bovee, Toy <& Sonntag. The

CAPTAIN DILLON'S CASE.
If Convicted of Beating a Sailor He
Will Have Another Chance on
Jurisdiction.
Because Captain John G. Dillon of the
Government transport Morgan City bat
tered a refractory sailor on the head with
a Mauser rifle in the harbor of Nagasaki
the whole of yesterday forenoon was
taken us in the United states iMstrfot
Court with ;tn argument on the question
as in whether the captain should be tried
for the offense by the Federal court or
whether a court-martial by the military
authorities was the proper mode of pro
cedure. Before the question was decided
Judge de Haven ordered the trial by jury
to proceed, the-counsel for the defendant
to be given an opportunity of asking for
a new trial In case of conviction. If ac
quitted there would be no necessity for
determining the issue of jurisdiction.
The testimony was all in at the close
of the day'B session and the case will be
submitted' to the jury this morning.
Muscular Mrs. Collins.
William Brown, a collector for Twang's
agency, wont to Mrs. Collins', Columbia

morning to collect a bill. When be made
his call known Mrs. I'ollins caught him
by the coat collar and threw him to the
bottom of the front stairs. Brown hur
ried to the City Hall and swore out a
warrant In Judge Graham's court for
Mrs. Collins' arrest on a charge of bat
tery.

I generally supposed, and not without truth, that
irnia are a little broader and
in their ideas than most other
communities. But the contrast between
itive representatives is often
conspicuous. The late Senatorial deadlock
â¢ I in two or three other
in Pennsylvania, of the truth of this
â  .. ... however, still more strongly illus
the anti-c 11 and by the act which

GOVERNMENT IN BUSINESS.
T] i E Examiner has been feeling around, in a sot
of intellectual darkness, fur a public and party
policy. For some time it cried out aimlessly
against trusts, picking out their evils, actual and al
leged, and using these in a steady appeal to prejudice
and passion, but without suggesting either an expe
dient or a radical remedy. In this the Examiner was
true to its inoculation with the theory and prac
tice of Populism, which lead to an attack upon all
existing conditions and the threat to destroy them,
but without proposing anything better to take their
place. The plain mind, reasoning from premises that
ore within the common horizon and common expe
rience, comes finally to reject any policy that is
merely destructive, and so Populism has been taken
up, examined, on occasions tried in various States
and is finally rejected. Not meeting with expected
success in its programme of mere destruction, the
Examiner has at last reached a constructive propo
sition, which it exploits under the name of "Public
( fwnership Through Public Thrift."
The terms are unscientific and misleading, but this
is the chronic defect with those who argue for acute
changes from an unscientific standpoint. Public
thrift, in its common acceptation, mean, the general
thrift arising in individual effort and industry. What
is meant by the Examiner is properly expressed in
"Government ownership by Government thrift."
The Examiner really understands it in this way,
for in its editorial indorsement of the plan it uses
only the word "Government" instead of "Public."
fts plan is for the Government, by taxation of the
people, to secure a surplus of $100,000,000, invest it
in productive property and reinvest the profits in like
( rty. The statement of the plan is somewhat
ue, but it is mathematically reduced to the con
clusion that the primary investment is to be only
Si 00.000,000, and the profit is to be 4 per cent com
pounded. With this start it is arithmetically demon
strated that in 100 years the Government will be in
possession of $108,495,856,890. But the plan does
end with this investment by the Federal Govern
ment. States, counties and cities are to go into the
same business. New York and Chicago are to in
vest $10,000,000 each, and in 100 years are to have
$10,849,585,689 each. As it is apparent that the plan
treats wealth and population as equivalents, the city
population of the country, investing in proportion
to New York and Chicago, will own at the end of
100 years twice as much as the Federal Government,
or $216,991,713,780. The counties and States follow,
and by the same standard and rate of investment will
be the owners in the same period of a sum equal to
that in possession of the Federal Government.
Therefore the grand total of wealth owned by the
United States at the end of a century of Government
ownership by Government thrift will be $43^,983,
--427.5(10âf0uroâfour0 â four hundred and thirty-three billion nine
hundred and eighty-three million four hundred and
twenty-seven thousand five hundred and sixty dollars.
As we have said, the Examiner's statement of the
plan is vague, fur it says editorially that "at the
rate <Â»:" $100,000,000 a year," while its mathematical
demonstration is confined to one investment of
$100,000,000.
The whole idea i< .1 fantasy, based primarily upon
the presumption of fixity of conditions that are by
nature unstable. For instance, the interest rate is
non-fixable, and the rate of profit is still more
changeable and has declined more evenly than in
terest. The fallacy of these mathematical speculations
i^ shown in the Thurman act, which dealt with a very
similar policy and i<sue. It suspended the payment
of interest by the Pacific railways on their debt to
the Government and substituted therefor a sinking
fund, payable out of surplus earning-. The operation
of this act was to cover a limited term of years, but
before the time had half expired Senator Thurman
himself confessed its failure, because he had based
his mathematical calculations upon the rate for
freight and passenger business charged at the time
he framed the bill. Upon that basis the sinking fund
invested at a fixed per cent would meet the principal
and interest of the debt at maturity. But. for causes
beyond Government control, the freight and passen
ger rates declined so rapidly that the plan was a com
plete failure.
Now. but one thing is needed to show the fallacy
of the Examiner idea and reduce it to an uninterest
ing speculation. The total wealth of the United
States, the entire value of all property, is put by
Mulhall, in round number-;, at $80,000,000,000. If all
this wealth were to steadily earn 4 per cent com
pounded, in 100 years it would equal $4,038,395,480,999
â four trillion thirty-eight billion three hundred
and ninety-five million four hundred, and eighty
thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine dollars â a
sum of course inconceivable and impossible.
The additions to wealth, in the strict care and at
tention given to it in private hands, are so continually
offset by shrinkages, relocations and loss, that no
prudence can avoid, that the net gain in any century
is held far below 4 per cent. .
But the Examiner plan includes not only Govern
ment investment, but Government thrift. It con
ceives the nece-sity for the Government to be rich,
to hold in its ownership, indeed, the entire wealth of
the country.
Thrift is not a possible function of government on
our scheme. Strong monarchical and bureaucratic
governments may seize the trade in intoxicants and
narcotics, or the business of carrying freight and
passengers, and get a profit out of them at the public
expense by high charges, for it is the fact that on
European railways in Government ownership the cost
of travel and transportation is far higher than here,
while the wages paid to trainmen are far lower. If
the countries quoted by the Examiner paid Ameri
can railroad wages and charged American rates, the
lack of Government thrift would appear in a return
of far less than 4 per cent, and in most cases a deficit
would replace profit.
Finally, the Examiner plan is simply the ownership
by the Government of all profit-producing business
and making the use of the facilities it controls, a
means of taxation. This runs easily from ownership
of telegraphs, telephones, street and steam railways,
ntiiÃs and quarries, to the field of production of the
food necessaries of life.
< )i course it is state communism, a condition in
which everybody will work for the Government and
all profit will go into the public treasury. Thence
where? Will it from time to time be parceled out,
and by win Jin ?
A GERMAN PROTEST.
ACTION taken by certain citizens of Chicago of
German birth to organize a national associa
tion of German-Americans with the object of
opposing anything in the way of the suggested
Anglo-American alliance is perhaps natural under
the circumstances, and yet is wholly unnecessary and |
can be of no benefit either to Germans or to
Americans.
It is clear the promoters of the proposed organi
zation have been moved to their action by the tone
I whidi prevails at this time in the utterances of a
THE SAN FKAXCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1899.
large proportion of the American press. The impe
rialist organs, favoring expansion and annexation,
have suddenly developed a great admiration for Great
Britain, and with more or less directness have advo
cated, if not a formal alliance, at least some sort of
concerted action with her in foreign affairs.
Furthermore, the recent actions of the German rep
resentatives in Samoa, and the vexatious restrictions
placed upon the sale of American food products in
Germany, have given rise to a good deal of severe
criticism in this country by the press t>f all parties.
Germans in America reading daily this talk of an
understanding with Great Britain, and the comments
upon the Samoan crisis, and the general course of the
Kaiser's Government, have naturally enough come to
the conclusion that efforts are being seriously made to
commit the United States to a course antagonistic to
the interests of Germany, and their love for their
fatherland moves them to protest.
Their conclusions, however, are wholly erroneous.
The people of the United States are thinking only
of the interests of the United States. It happens just
at this juncture that our interests coincide with those
of Great Britain, and not with those of Germany. It
was not very long ago, however, that we were talking
of war with Great Britain over the Venezuelan ques
tion much more loudly than we are now talking of
strife with the Kaiser. What has happened once may
happen again, and before the year is over we may
have another conflict of interests with the British,
and then the Anglo-American alliance talkers will
either shut up like a clam or begin talking the other
way.
The policy of the American people is, in short, that
of every other people. We are friendly to those who
help us and antagonistic to those who oppose us. We
have no entangling alliances with any European
power and are not going to form any. Where our
foreign interests are at stake all citizens, whether for
eign or native born, are expected to support our Gov
ernment. There is no more reason why there should
be a German-American organization to oppose this
or that foreign policy than a French-American, a
Spanish-American or a British-American organiza
tion for a like purpose. America is hoeing her own
row, and there is no reason why any class of her peo
ple should form political organizations other than
such as are open to all citizens, without respect to
race, birthplace, creed, color or previous condition
of servitude.
ThjE TAX-SHIRKER'S BURDEN.
AX interesting question which should have been
considered shortly after the enactment of the
war revenue law and the refusal of the ex
press companies of the United States to pay their
taxes is, How are the people who are now bearing
the Government burdens of these corporations going
to recoup themselves? According to estimates the
people of the Pacific Coast are paying between $8000
and $10,000 a month to the Government which should
be paid by Wells, Fargo & Co.
This money is being disbursed entirely under pro
test. Whenever a person offers a package to Wells,
Fargo & Co. for shipment that corporation issues a
receipt and informs the shipper that he must stick a
one cent revenue stamp upon it. The only alternative
for the shipper is to comply or take his package else
where, which is usually an expensive operation, both
;;s to time and transportation charges, since no other
corporation in this vicinity is engaged in the busi
ness of shipping small packages by rail. The opera
tion is of the bulldozing order. You may either pay
the express company's war taxes or you may trans
port your package yourself, which in these days of
long distances and bad roads is a very painful pro
ceeding.
So far as we know there is no possibility of the
people ever getting this money back. Every dollar
which they pay to the Government in liquidation of
the war taxes of the express companies is lost to them
forever. The wildest dreamer who ever considered
the subject has not suggested that in case the ex
press companies are ultimately defeated in the liti
gation which has been instituted against them they
will return to shippers the value of the stamps placed
by them upon the receipts and bills of lading issued
under the law.
There is a legal maxim which says that for every
wrung there is a remedy, but unless somebody can
invent a retroactive statute which will apply to this
case there is here an outrage for which no redress
can be obtained. If public opinion were as strong in
tli is country as in England Wells, Fargo & Co. would
either be compelled to pay their war taxes or abandon
their business. The people would not patronize
a corporation which indulged in this form of treason.
If President Valentine were actually engaged in the
business of shipping arms and munitions of war to
Aguinaldu he could not more effectually obstruct the
Government in its war policy. He is refusing de
liberately to bear his share of the necessary expense
of carrying on military operations abroad, and to
that extent he is giving aid and comfort to a foreign
enemy.
There is but one penalty for the course adopted
by this corporation. Impartial history ultimately
sets down the men who indulge in it as a lot of un
patriotic, penurious, hair-splitting, soulless Peck
sniffs.
It is reported that the American Commissioners to
the Peace Conference will be given unlimited liberty
of discussion, but no power to act, and as the Com
missioners of other nations will probably have about
equal authority, the meeting of the dignitaries will
hardly be much more useful than a picnic.
When the Samoan Commission divides the islands
wo shall see just how many live savages we are to get
to make up for the loss of Lieutenant Lansdale, and
then we can form an estimate of the profits of im
perialism.
The Beef Inquiry Commission might as well em
balm its report and bury it. The country has read
the evidence and returned a verdict acquitting Gen
eral Miles of the charge of talking too much or too
strongly.
As The Call never libels anybody the law requiring
all libelous matter to be signed does not affect us.
All the same, the Governor who signed such a law
ought to feel sheepish for the rest of his natural life.
The whirligig of time is sure to bring about his
revenges, and Chief Lees may yet have the satisfac
tion of arresting Mose Gunst before he has went and
reformed.
The only signature that will stand to attest the
enactment of the Morehouse law is that of Gage, and
that is enough to kill it.
President David Starr Jordan says the ideal college
professor should be the best margin the community.

GAS RATES TO
BE REDUCED
VOLUNTARILY
Company Officials to
Act To-day.
INVESTIGATION IS DEFERRED
A BEDUCTION TO $1 50 IS EX
PECTED.
Moses A. Gunst, Commissioner of Po
lice, Is Granted Six Months'
Leave of Absence by the
Board.
The officials of the San Francisco Gas
and Electric Company have accepted the
inevitable. Conscious of the fact that
the Supervisors purposed reducing the I
j price of gas, the corporation has decided j
to take the initiative in the matter. Its
; directorate will meet to-day and as a
i mere matter of policy' will name a rate i
i which it was intended should be forced
I upon the company. This was the infor
i mation imparted to the Supervisors at a
meeting yesterday.
The. board, after acting- in a vacillating
manner for some weeks past on the ques
tion of gas rates, apparently decided upon
J $1 50 per thousand feet as the price to be
charged hereafter. The minority mem
bers of the board wanted that body to
stand by its action fixing $1 10 as the rate,
but in the face of a solid majority this
seemed impossible. The valiant minority i
(composed of Supervisors Pexrault, Lack
mann, Byington, Deasy and Heyer) then
made a brave stand for a compromise
| rate of $1 35. This did not appeal to the !
majority; hence the inclination of the i
members to agree upon $1 50 became more '
and more apparent. The officials of theÂ»
gas company must obviously meet that !
figure at their meeting to-day, or the
threatened investigation as to the cost of j
production and delivery of gas will be
continued. The outcome of this will be '
that the board will then arbitrarily fix
a rate. It is not expected this action will
be necessary.
The meeting which had adjourned from
the previous day was held in the assem- !
! bly" room of the board. When Mayor '
| Pnelan called the members to order there j
were but two absentees Supervisors At- ;
. tridge and Collins. His Honor the Mayor ,
: announced that the proper procedure i
would be for the board to resolve itself :
: into a committee of the whole and elect !
! a presiding officer. Upon motion, Super- j
i visor Kalben, chairman of the Street
! Light Committee, was called to preside. i
The object of the meetingâ that of inves- !
tigating the gas question and fixing rates !
for the city and for private consumers â
was outlined briefly.
Thomas B. Bishop, chief of counsel for !
i the San Francisco Gas and -Electric Com
pany, appeared for the first time before |
the "inquisitorial body for the corporation.
He stepped forward and in a conversa
tional voice informed the Supervisors that
the directorate of the gas company would !
meet to-day and would then discuss a
voluntary reduction of rates. He inti-
I mated that there was a question as to the j
â  power vested in the board to arbitrarily
fix the rates to be charged for gas. The
board, he said, would oblige the people |
j he represents if it would adjourn until
Thursday and give them time to act in >
! the premises. He said such action would j
j tend to I save controversy, even should j
' the right of the board to act be finally
determined In its favor.
The request for postponement was
! granted without further debate. There j
I was a difference of opinion as to when the
hearing should be resumed. Mayor Phe
lan suggested the sooner it was disposed
: of the better for all i parties Interested.
i The next meeting contemplates merely
' the hearing of a report, and should take
but a short time. This was volunteered
to offset an objection raised by Super- â 
visor Aigeltlnger that the Street Com
mittee would be in session all that day.
After a brief discussion the committee 1
named to-morrow morning at 10 o'clock â 
as the time for continuing the hearing.
At the opening of the deliberations Su
pervisor Perrault asked permission to in
troduce a resolution granting Moses A.
I Gunst, Commissioner of Police, leave of
absence from the State for six months, :
: from the 23d inst. Supervisor Aigeltinger
protested against action by the board on '
i the ground that the matter should prop
erty be considered first by the Committee '.
; on "Health and Police. A majority of the;
' committee members was pr<gÂ»ent. Super
visor Lackmann spoke in favor of grant
ing the request. his associates speaking in
the same strain. Mayor Phelan, who .
; presided, suggested that this be received
as the report of the committee. This
course was pursued, and the board then
voted in favor of granting the desired ;
I leave of absence.

CITY TREASURER
MAY GO TO JAIL
FOR CONTEMPT
Trouble Over Fees of
Stenographers.
WOULD IGNORE THE AUDITOR
THE SUPREME COURT WILL BE
ASKED TO DECIDE.
Officials Protest Against Shorthand
Reporters Being Exempted
From Safeguards Thrown
Around Funds.
Treasurer Truman and Auditor "Wells
have decided to ask the Supreme Court
to decide as to whether or not the sten
ographers of the Superior Court can
draw their salaries on court orders with- |
out having the same audited before pre- ,
sentation to the Treasurer for payment. :
In order to bring the matter to an Issue j
Treasurer Truman will probably be sent j
to jail to-day on a charge of contempt of j
court for refusing to pay a demand on
the treasury issued by Superior Judge
Cook in favor of his official stenographer, j
If this action is taken by Judge Cook the \
Treasurer will secure his release from j
custody on bonds and will immediately
appeal the case to the Supreme Court.
The court stenographers are the only
persons in the employ of the municipality
who claim exemption from the general I
rule as to the procedure necessary for j
the payment of salary demands. All other
demands must pass through the hands of
and be signed by the Auditor before they
can be honored by the Treasurer. In the I
case of stenographers a different mode
of procedure has been followed in the
past. They receive $10 for each day they
are in attendance at court, and 15 and 20 j
cents per folio for transcripts of testi
mony taken by them. At the end of each
week, or oftener if desired, the Judge of
the court in which the work has been j
done signs an official order commanding â 
the Treasurer to pay to the stenographer
whatever amount may be due for his ser- |
vices. It is alleged that as this order for |
money is an official order of the court
the Treasurer has no legal right to with- !
hold payment so long as there- is any i
funds in his possession with which it may j
be satisfied.
In this way seven stenographers draw
out of the treasury each year a sum of â 
money aggregating about $50,000. The
Auditor is entirely ignored in the trans
tion. and as the orders do not pass
through his hands he is always in ignor
ance of the exact amount of money left
in the general fund and against which
there are thousands of other demands
which he must audit.
Some time ago Auditor Wells and Tn-a-s
--urer Truman held a conference, the re
sult of which was that the Treasurer an
nounced that he would not in future
honor orders of court for stenographers'
salaries unless they were first passed upon
by the' Auditor. This decision was commu
nicated to the stenographers, with the re
sult that some of them announced their
intention of testing the matter. Steps to
this end were taken when the Treasurer
refused to pay the order presented by
the stenographers in Judge Cook's court.
Judge Cook immediately issued an or
der citing the Treasurer to appear before
him to-day to show cause why lie should
not be punished for contempt in ignoring
an order of court.
The Auditor and Treasurer held a con
sultation with their legal advisers yes
terday, and it was decided to take the
matter to the Supreme Court in the event
that Judge Cook sees fit to commit the
Treasurer to jail for contempt.
"This action is to be taken," said Aud
itor Wells yesterday, "in the Interest of
the people. It is not right or just that the
stenographers should be made a priv
ileged class and bo allowed to draw upon
the people's money without a proper
check to prevent possible fraud. They
draw pay out of all proportion to the
value of their services, and it has even
been asserted that the Judges are in part
nership with them. The practice now in
vogue seriously hampers the affairs of the
office, and in a degree jeopardizes the
interests of every creditor of the city."
The following letter received yesterday
by the Board of Supervisors is pertinent

waged:

EBB TIDE WAS
WRONG TIDE FOR
THE CHILKAT
Eleven Men Were
Drowned Rashly.
DANGEROUS RISK WAS TAKEN
BUSHING FOR SCHEDULE TIME
CAUSED A WRECK.
Rigid Investigation of the Eureka
Disaster Begun by the In
spectors of Steam
Vessels.
A tragic story of the sen was rehearsed
yesterday before the United States In
spectors of Steam Vessels during the in
vestigation into the losa of the coasting
steamer Chilkat on the Humboldt bar on
the 4th Inst. .'*
The steamer left Eureka on the obb
tide and the 8< j a was choppy, but two ri
val steamers had already gone out and
the captain did not wait for the safe r
flood tide because he was anxious to make
up time, such being tho orders of the
owners of the boat. The boat went up
against the bar in a choppy sea. Just its
she had got well Into the breakers a
heavy wave broke over the bows. Tho
steamer quivered and staggered, like a
strong man reeling before the blows of
an adversary, then recovering, lung-eel
forward into the swelling billows. The
next moment a huge wave topped with
foam rolled down upon her, throwing her
upon her side and breaking her back upon
the shallow bar.
A panic fell upon the passengers and
crew as they were jarred off their feet
by the shock, and a' rush was made for
the lifeboats and the life preservers.
What happened after that was not clearly
remembered by the living. All was con
fusion, the one thought in the breasts of
all being self-preservation, at which time
the selfishness of the human being 13
equaled only by that of the four-footed
mammal. The * living could remember
only obscurely what had happened to
themselves; what had happened to tha
dead they did not and could not know.
The second great wave that struck tha
bow of the steamer proved her undoing.
She shivered and keeled over on the bar,
spilling her passengers and such of her
freight as was movable. Eleven human
beings went down in the boiling waters,
and when the life had gone out of them
were washed ashore with the rest of tha
debris of the wreck.
The witnesses called yesterday wera-^
unanimously of the opinion that seamen
considered the bar dangerous at ebb tide,
and that if tho steamer had started on
flood tide there would not have been a
wreck and loss of life. The reason given
for the sailing of the vessel at this peril
ous stage of the water was that the North
Fork and the Pomona had just left port,
and that the captain nf the Chilkat was
! anxious to make his schedule time, which
he would not have been able to do had ha
waited for the Hood tide.
Peter J. Johnson, first officer, told the
inspectors that the cargo was light, being
composed of butter and shingles, Eureka
butter not being strong enough to wreck
a vessel. The steamer was seaworthy,
save that site was a little weak about
the "fo'k'sl." He admitted, in answer to
a question by Captains Boles and Bulger,
that it was safer to go out of port on tha
flood tide rather than on the ebb.
William Grief, fireman on the Chilkat.
said. "We were always scared to pro out
on the ebb tide, because we consideroa it
dangerous."
C. C. Lightner. first engineer, was of
the opinion that the steamer should have
gone over the bar on the flood tido.
The investigation was continued until
the arrival of the Weeott with more wit
nesses.

SUCCESSFUL RAIDS
BY PRICE'S SQUAD
TWO HOUSES ENTERED AND
EVIDENCE SECURED.
Officer Butler Again Disguised Him
self as a Chinaman and Passed
the Lookouts.
T^ieutenant Price and posse made two
very successful raids in Chinatown last
I ni^ht. Both games were closed and full
! tan layouts were captured.
The ruse which worked so successfully
last week was used last night. Officer But
ler arrayed himself in fiill Chines.- cos

j Into Washington or "Fish' 1 alley. Lleu-
I tenant Price followed him from the Jack
son street entrance to the alley and Offi
cers Bonner, King and Taylor waited at
i the Washington street corner. Butler
| walked up to the door, gave the rap and
i vis admitted. lie had barely entered the
room when he was recognized and a mad
: scramble fur the door followed. Tho
â  keeper grabbed up his coin, but Butler
stuck a revolver in his face and ordered
him to drop it. At the door the Beefna
gamblers were met by Homier, King anil
Taylor, each of whom captured a man.
Five Chinese and Butler, still in his cos
were bundled Into a patrol wagon
I and Ptarted t<> the station.
At the coni.r of the all< y Butler quietly
I slipped out and started out for fresh fields
and pastures new. The other squad men
kept in sight of him and finally saw him
enter the rooms of the Hang X >ok Society
kson and l mponl streets. Thi
l; re was a repetition of that at Fish aiiey.
but the lighting with escaping Chinese
was a little fiercer. Officer rtlog lost his
hat in the. melee and tor the balance op
the night was adorned with a Chinese
hat. Five players and complete evidence
were taken.
Although not many -men were booked as
a result of the raids, they are, neverthe
less, considered very successful, as not
only was evidence secured but the Chl
were actually seen playing the
games.

CHADBOURNE'S DIPLOMA.
He Presents a Second Commission
From Governor Gage to the Har
bor Commissioners.
There was another regular meeting of
the KtaU Board of Harbor Commissioners
yesterday afternoon and Colonel F. R.
Chadbourne reappeared on the scene with
a second commission from Governor Gnge
appointing him to the place on the board
occupied By Rudolph Herold. No one in
qutred how many more commifi.siones the
Governor had up his sleeve fur "Chad,"
but the b cond one inared the fate of the
ilrst. It was respectfully inspected and
returned to Colonel Chadbourne. The res
olution rejecting the document was adopt
ed by a party vote, or, in other words,
President Kilburn voted to plve the appli
cant th.' t^fiit and (Commissioners Harney
and Herald voted against seating him.
Colonel < 'hadbourne's first appointment,
made prior to the adjournment of the
Legislature, was confirmed by the Sen
ate. The commission presented yesterday
bears date of April 17, and, of course, this
.-ippciintment lacks confirmation. The sec,-
1 differs slightly from the tlrst In this
respectâ that ft contains the words "un
expired term." whereas the first simply
commissioned the colonel to the position
of Harbor Commissioner, "Instead of Ru
dolph Herold, failed lo qualify, etc."
There may be something hidden in the
law which makes Colonel Chadbourne's
â  I commission better than the first.

DRIED FRUIT IN NEW YORK.
The New York Commercial says:
"Prunes are moving well under a strong
Jobbing demand, and prices are strong at quo
tations, with holders showing indications oÂ£
being indifferent sellers. Contradictory in
formation comes from the coast regarding the
supply left in first hands, but it is certain
that the quantity is small. A few cars more
rr less in a statement now are inconsequential,
and would hardly affect the market one way
or another. Spot supplies are held firmly up
to quotations, and buyers for retail distribu
tion take only small lots as a rule, The
needs of consumption are Increasing, how
ever, and with the best period of the year
for consumption ahead holders consider that
the prospect justifies high and firm prices.
'â¢There is a somewhat better feeling in rais-
Jns. due to the announcement that the dif
ferences between growers and packers had
been settled. It is reported that practically
all have signed the new agreement, which
makes the association stronger than ever be
fore. There have been some inquiries for
moderate sized quantities during the past few
â¢lays, both here and on the coast. But, so far
as known, no actual sales resulted.
"Peaches continue in moderately strong re
quest, with prices tending upward on all
grades, principally on peeled. Sales have been
made at better than 30 cents, and the tendency
Is still upward. Reports of serious shortage
In nil peach producing centers except Cali
fornia indicate that there will be a scarcity
this season Holders are confident of a fur
ther advance, and it seems probable that
prices Will advance as stocks clean up.
"Apricots are entirely in second hands.
There are few obtainable in any position, but
trade continues fairly .eood. and holders are
certain of improvement later."

expectation of a change In ita finances in con
nection with a sale of the company's road.
Colorado Fuel and Iron also advanced nearly
3 points. The. decision by the Court of Appeais

peared for Louisville and Southern preferred
which benefited each a point. The anthracite
coalers were stronger. There was talk that a
reorganization of the capital of North Ameri
can was beins arranged and the stock was

about a fcoint on Its handsome statement of

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, April IS.â A report by the Illinois
Agricultural Bureau, which claimed the crop
In the State was in an exceedingly bad condi
tion, started wheat strong. This statement
met with a Eood deal of criticism, however,
and after a strong effort, the bears succeeded
i in causing a loss of the greater part of the
; advance at which trading had commenced. Pri
: vate crop reports were plentiful and on the
whole as bad as ever, but liquidation of May
holdings prevented any extensive advance dur
' ins the greater part of the forenoon. The Illi
nois report, however, was too sensationally bad
to be ignored, and it asserted itself later in the
day, In spite of the selling out of long wheat
and short selling of July. The latter was of
benefit to the market later, when shorts took
i fright and contended with bulls for the limit
I of offerings. Western primary market receipts
, were llerht and clearances fair. The world's
' visible supply decreased 686,000 bushels. Realiz
: ing near the end of the session on account of
a Irish crop summary covering the Southern
States and a statement on reliable authority
that 90 per cent of spring seeding would be
; done in ten days resulted In a loss of nearly all
' the advance. July reached a premium of l%c
over May. July opened at 75%@75 1 ,4 c, declined
to 74% c. advanced to 76Vic, declined to 74% c
and closed at 74% c. May followed July.
Corn disappointed holders, proving very indif
ferent to the wheat excitement. Prices ruled
steady, but with narrow limits. May corn
closed %c lower.
Oats were strengthened by Braustreet's state
ment of the available supply, as it showed a
decrease of 631,000 bushels for the week. This
was about three times larzer than the visible
decrease given yesterday. May oats closed a
I shade lower.
| Scattered outside buying and coverings
! strengthened provisions. There was a good
deal of changing from May to July. May pork
closed Be higher.

following chances in the available supply of
grain last Saturday, as compared with the
preceding Saturday:
Wheatâ United States and Canada, east of
the Rockies, decrease, 556.0C0 bushels.
Liverpool Corn Trade News: Afloat for and
in Europe, decrease, 100,000 bushels. Total sup
ply, decrease, 686,000 bushels.
Corn â United States and Canada, east of
the Rockies, decrease, 2,547,000 bushels.
Oats United States and Canada, east of the
Rockies, decrease, 661,000 _ bushels.
The aggregate stocks 'of wheat held at
Portland. Or., and Taconm and Seattle, Wash.,
Increased 66,000 bushels last week.
* BOSTON WOOL MARKET.
BOSTON, April IS.â The American Woo! and
Cotton Reporter will say to-morrow:
The feature of the wool market during the
past week has been the sale of a consid
erable amount of territory wool for ex- |
port, taken by English parties who are sup- j
posed to have paid for the same about 3S |
cents clean. There have been free exports of |
Australian wool also, which has been held hera
in bond, purchasers paying from 40 to 45 cents
clean. The market presents a remarkable con
dition of affairs. With a duty of 11 cents per |
pound on fine wools, we behold the singular j
spectacle of the domestic product selling at 1
such a low price as to warrant its exportation. <
The general market has been fairly active, the I
sales for the past week aggregating nearly j
5.000,000 pounds. The demand has been chiefly
for territories grading fine medium. Prices are
steady and unchanged, but any attempt to se
cure an advance instantly checks negotiations
between buyers and sellers. The sales of the
last week ,have been made at as low prices as
have been seen this year for the same quality
of stuff.
The sales of the week at Boston amounted to
3,270.000 pounds domestic and 1.661.500 pounds
foreign, making a total of 4,931,500 pounds,
against a. total of 7,927,500 for the previous
week, and a total of 1,151,000 pounds for the
corresponding week last year. Sales since
January 1. 1599. amount to 61.935.300 pounds,
against 41,573,810 pounds last year at this
time.

Since the Moana left the following coal ves
sels have arrived from Newcastle, N. S. W. :
Strathdon, 3057 tons; Sonoma, 1597; Prussia,
1&20; total, 6474 tons. Under ordinary circum
stances the very light deliveries of Australian
fuel for the past several months would have
caused a marked advance of price, whereas no
change Is at all noticeable and but few In
quiries are being made for colonial grades, as
they are being supulanted by our northern
coast products. Colliery proprietors at New
castle very Imprudently advanced their prices
Is per ton at- a most Inopportune time, as
freights were then at their highest point, caus
ing the delivery price here to reach such a
figure that our large consumers were diverted
to cheaper fuel. There are at present thirty
seven vessels chartered for here from Sydney
and Newcastle, with a carrying canaclty of
about 98,000 tons. Of these ten have already
left. With the present promising outlook for
our incoming harvest there should be fully
50 per cent more tonnage chartered in the
colonies to transport coal to this port. Freight
rates from Newcastle are quoted at 16s per
ton, as tonnage Is reported to be in demand
for other sections, but the writer looks for a
decline from present asking rates when our
grain shippers enter the market as charterers,
which must be very shortly now. The season
Is advancing too rapidly for them not to de
clare thmeselves at an early date. Several en
gagements have recently been made for Swan
sea loading at less freights than from New
castle. This will serve to diminish colonial
deliveries.

Ailyar appeared to be the ready money

6 to 2, and then the smart gentry un

In the mile purse run Dr. Sheppard was !
asked to beat Storm King only. The |

Track Notes.
Once again The Call picked all six win
ners yesterday. Two of the races were
picked one, two, three, and in the first
the 20 to 1 shot Florence Fink was given
for the place.
In the start of the mile and a sixteenth
event the crowd hissed Mr. Ferguson be
cause Thorpe beat his barrierâ not an un
usual occurrence. After the race Presi
dent Williams set a stern foot down on
this sort of thing. Thorpe was fined $100,
and told that it" he did. not line up at the
barrier with the balance of the rtders he
could look for indefinite suspension.
Jenkins is getting to be a very popular
rider with the public. He is an honest,
unassuming lad, well deserving of thÂ»Â»
praise bestowed on him. With his Judg
ment of pace there seems to be no rea
son why IT nip's rider should not get to
the top* of the heap.

ALL WOUNDS DECLARED
TO BE ANTE-MORTEM
EVIDENCE THAT A KNIFE WAS
USED.
Although a Paddle Wheel May Have
Caused the Injuries There Is
Much to Offset This
Theory.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
908 Broadway, April 18.
An autopsy was held thin afternoon on
the remains of the man picked up from
the bay off the Oakland mole yesterday.
It is the opinion of the doctors and Coro
: r Mehrmann that all the wounds found
c body were ante-morten, although
thi3 does not necessarily mean that a
murder or even a suicide ha* been com-
"The death of this man is somewhat
mysterious," said Coroner Mehrmann,
"and ft is a case in which everybody can
theorize to his heart's content. In the
first place, the man had not been dead
more than ten hours when he whs
brought to the Morgue. Had he been un
der a paddle wheel or br-en struck with a
propeller I hnrdly think he would have
ped without the ]osÂ« of more flesh.
"There are several wounds on the body
that wen- certainly inflicted by a knifÂ«-,
and al! of them were ante-mortem. Had
the man been drowned he would not have
been "n the surface so noon after death

wounds v â  i at the same time

police should look into the matter .is it
is- possible that the cause of death may
â â¢â¢ either suicide or accident i shall
hold an Inquest to-morrow night by
which time the remains may have been

the origin of ihÂ«- man's death, but have

STANFORD MEN
RAID BERKELEY
THE CAPTURED AX SOUGHT, BUT
NOT FOUND.
Ineffectual Attempt Made to Recover
the Mascot of the Palo
Altans.
BERKELEY, April IS.â At 2 o'clock
last night, after carefully preventing all
means of detection, sixty Stanford stu
- made their first raid by creeping
stealthily into the university town in a
deliberate attempt to recapture their
stolen ax by force. The attempt failed.
The Stanford men left Palo Alto secret
ly yesterday afternoon and came up to
San Francisco. They held a hurri.-.i meet-
Ing at the Ramona Hotel on Kills street
to lay their plans.
Coming over to Oakland they remained
in hiding until midnight and then proceed
ed to Berkeley by twos and threes to a
point of rendezvous near the university
campus. Having heard that the ax was
placed for safety in the hands of Charlie
Pringle, one of Berkeley's last year foot
ball stars, they completed their plans for
raiding his house. Pringle is a member
of the Chi Phi fraternity, which has Its
chapter hall at 2222 Bancroft way.
Only six men stayed In the Chi Phi house
last night and these were sleeping sound
ly when the raid began. Mark Chese
brough occupied a room on the
floor, Pringle one on the third. A sharp
rap at the door awakened Chesebrough.
To the question as to whether Pringle were
in or not Chesebrough replied in the neg
ative. I'puii receiving this answer a
squad of Stanford men burst open the
front door. They made their way to
Pringle' s room, awakened him an â :
manded the stolen trophy. It was re
fused. The Chi Phi men at first thought
distance but realizing the uselessness
of facing such overwhelming numbers
submitted to seeing their house ran
sacked.
i 'hesebrough attempted to jump from
a window Into the back yard. Tie faced
a strong guard of Stanford men and
crawled back. Failing in this attempt to
raise an alarm he tried to get help from
the outside by means of telephone. But
the wires had all been cut by the raiders,
.so this means failed.
Half of the attacking party entered the
â  and began a thorough search.
Wardrobes, cuphoards, trunks, bureausâ
every imaginable place In which the ax
might have been hid was torn open and
its contents spread about in all sorts of
confusion. A few private boxes, contain
ing the fraternity Bscrets and mystic
paraphernalia, were left undisturbed, the
fraternity men giving their word of honor
that the monster blade was not concealed
in them.
Once during the search two or three
Stanford men came very near the ax; In
fact, passed right by the place where it
remained concealed.
The search proved fiuitless. After over
an hour of probing and delving Into all
possible hiding places the Stanford men
ffave up the hunt.
A telegram was received from Stan
ford to-day by Track Manager P. J.
Franklin Btating that unless some guar
antee could be given that the ax would be
kept out of sight during the field day next
Saturday the event would be declared off.
Franklin telegraphed back that every pre
caution would be taken to keep the tung
nff the rampup and that a cordon of po
lice would be stationed at the cindpr track
to prevent its being carried within the
luclosure.
HONORED THE TWENTY-FOURTH
Colored Troops Welcomed by Bethel
A. M. E. Church.
Stnndingr-room was at a premium at
the reception tendered the members of
the Twenty-fourth Regiment Monday
evening by the congregation of the Bethel

After the singing of the National An
them by the choir and the audience the

African Methodist Zion Church, deliv
ered a stirring prayer. Joseph S. Francis
of the Western Outlook followed with an
eloquent address of welcome to the guests
of the evening. He eulogized the men
for the splendid work they did In the late
war. In glowing words he described
their charge up the San Juan. Hill amid
shot and shell.
Dr. Anderson, the pastor of the church.
welcomed the boys in blue In behalf of
his church. He begged the men to re
main away from a moonlight picnic that
was to be given in their honor, as he
feared they might spoil their good rec
ord. Mrs. \V. B. Poweel and BUSS Be.a
triee Harris rendered a few songs and
Jessie Haley recited, as did Ed Pruett.
Sergeant Major Green of the Twenty
fourth Regiment was then introduced and
told at length the experiences encoun
: by the men during the Cuban cam
paign. Ife concluded with a description
of the battle in which the colored troops
their line record. Sergeant Frank
lin of Company E concluded the enter
tainment by some personal recollections
oi the fight. His account was replete
with humor and created a great deal of
merriment. The guests, headed by their
band, marched to the basement and were
refreshed with good things.

THE SA:N FRAKCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, APRIL 19, 1899.
AN ELOQUENT PLEA
FOR INDIVIDUAL UNIT
FATHER MACCORRY LECTURES.
AT A BENEFIT.
A Large Audience Listens to the
Brilliant Paulist Missionary and
Applauds His Sentiments.
If the armory of Company O, In St.
, Mary's College on the Mission road, had
, been twice its size the great crowd that
attended the lecture given by the Rev.
1 Father MacCorry, O. S. P., last evening
might have been comfortably accommo
dated. The popularity of the eloquent
young Paulist missionary, and the fact
that he appeared for the benefit of St.
I John's Church, of which Father Brady is
pastor, resulted in tilling the hall to over
flowing.
Preceding the lecture Miss Etta Welsh.
J. C. McDonnell, Miss Annie Rooney and
, J. Gildea were heard in songs and their
efforts were appreciated by the audience.
A 1 the conclusion of the musical pro
gramme. Chairman P. J. Curtis intro
duced Father MacCorry to his audience
i and he was warmly greeted. The speaker
; chose as his subject. "The T'nit in Crea
tion's Plan; a Plea for Light, for Liberty
and Independence." He handled his
: theme in an able manner and for nearly
, an hour entertained his listeners with his
views. In part he said:
As individuals in this world we are frag
ments. God makes the human race in atoms
and then with a master hand gradually fits
them together until they constitute, as it
were a single unit, wonderfully harmonious
and amazingly made. Our deficits and sur
pluses of character are given wheels in the
great established mechanism. What I lack
you make up, what you lack I supply. One
man has the patience, another the courage,
the third the tranquillity and the fourth the
?.-u! That which la lacking in one is made
up by another or else made up by all. Each,
too, has his work to do â his duty to perform
and each in his own peculiar way.
I have no more right to blame a man for
being different from me or from doing things
In another way from mine, than a driving
wheel has the right to blame the axle that
holds It to the center. Just because the axle
Is differently made. Moreover I can not ac
complish your work or you mine. The axle
can never be the driving wheel nor the driv
ing wheel an axle. You can do other work
or similar work or better work, but you can
not do my work. The difficulty la we are
never satisfied with the work which God has
given us to do. In a pathetic little way we
strive to defeat his plans.
The Bpeaker illustrated his meaning
with a few apt similes, and then went on
to show what a magnificent thing it is to
!"â¢ a unit, to feel thai you are one. a per
sonality; an individual: to be something
of tm investigator, something of a rea-
Boner for yourself. To feel that the census
of this big world would not be complete
unless you were counted in. He then
showed that the right of each individual
man tv play a personal part in the drama
of the nations is the birthright of Ameri
can s pie He proved that Washington
desired all men to rejoice in a personal
Independence, to be plad in the pleasure
of reeling themselves men: that he wished
every Individual to be surrounded with
respect and consideration; that he ush
ered in an era In which every man
crowned with tremendous possibilities
should be recognized as a unit in crea
tion's plan.
FATHER PROSECUTED
BY TWO DAUGHTEI
irt frequenters witnessed the unusual
scene yesterday of two daughters taking
the stand and lending their assistance in
an effort to hang their father. It was In
the case of Joseph Clark, on trini for the
murder of Joseph Cross, that this unusual
was enacted, and it furnished food
for unlimited comment, as did the actions
of the prisoner's wife in aiding the Dis
trict Attorney during the examination of
witnessi s.
Doubtless the young women took the
stand with the sole intention of telling the
truth, but it was only after consultation
: with the prosecution, and the fact that
, they Intended to tt-11 the truth and did so
did not protect them from criticism, aa
it was their father they wr.- attempting
to send to the gallows or prison.
Lottie fitirk was flrst called to the
1 Stand by the prosecution, and stated that
! she was employed us cashier in a Market
street restaurant. She then stated that
when her family moved to its present
| homo Joseph (Irnss was taken into the
house as a boarder in order to increase
the family revenue. She said she had not
visited her father since his arrest, as Bhe
i did not believe he wanted to see her. j i --r
Bister then took the stand, and, to the
i surprise of the prosecution, although she
I had been called to aid in securing a con
j viction, said that when Gross went to live
In their mother's house her father refused
to live there and moved away. She also
said that she had not called on her father,
a.s she believed he did not want to see
| her. She passed her father several flmes
: on the street, she said, and he did not
speak, and once when she boarded a car
she found him seated on the dummy, but
he Immediately got off the car. Her
Btatement that Clarke refused to live in
the house after^Sross went there to llvo
materially assisted the defense, as it
wished to establish beyond the perad
venture of a doubt that Gross did live in
the house with Mrs. Clark, and it was
left with this witness for the prosecution
to establish this fact.
Wlun Miss '"lark left the stand other
witnesses testified to minor details, after
which the case went over until this morn
ing for argument. When court adjourned
I two women, who posed as palmists, ap
proached the prisoner and gained per
mission to examine his hand. The ladies
examined his hand at length and then
said tliat his was riot the hand of a crimi
nal, that it manifested great love of
home but great jealousy. They' comment
ed at length on the fact that the hind
was not that of a criminal, and Clark
then turned away and with a weary smile
playing about his mouth, said: "if they
were the Judges I would doubtless be ac
quitted instantly; but they are not."
The interested crowd that had watched
the reading of the prisoner's hand then
filed out of court and Clark was returned
, to his cell to grieve over the "affection"
'. shown him by his family.
Contest for a Child.
Application was made yesterday in the
Probate Court by. the Kureka Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Children for
the cuÃtody of Ida Aubray, the infant
daughter of Mrs. Edna Aubray, who w.13
arrested a (Vw weeks ago for vagrancy,
but was dismissed by Judge Conlan after
telling h<-r story.
Airs. Aubray married againnt the will
of her father. Captain Van Pelt of the
ferry-boat [Tkiah. Shortly after her mar
riage Mrs. Aubray separated from her
husband and went to live on Turk street.
Recently the young mother was arrested
for vagrancy CO prevent, it in s;ii<l. a pos
sible reconciliation with her husband; but
Judge Conlan promptly dismissed the ac
tion. Now the Eureka Society seeks to
take the child from its mother's arms, but
there will be a lively contest for tne
baby's possession.

IN YEARLY SESSION
State Society Meets at
Del Monte.
TIMELY TOPICS DISCUSSED
IMPROVED METHODS OF COM
BATING DISEASE.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
DEL MONTE, April IS.â The twenty
ninth annual meeting of the Medical So
ciety of the State of California was called
to order in the ballroom of the Hotel Del
Monte at 10 o'clock this morning. The
address of welcome was delivered by Dr.
Harry M. Sherman of San Francisco, and
was followed by the address of. the presi
dent. Dr. William Watt Kerr of San
Francisco. The society then adjourned
until 2:30 p. m.
At the afternoon session Dr. 11. B. San
derson read a paper entitled "The Toxic
Basis of Insanity." He was quite of the
opinion that many if not most cases of
Insanity are due to poisons generated in
the body and affecting the structure of
the brain aa well as other organs. He
thought many advances would be made
in the treatment of insanity in the next
few years.
Dr. Leo Newmark read a paper entitled
"Obsessions," which dealt with a. form of
peculiar mental affection occasionally met
with.
Dr. George L. Cole presented a paper on
the subject of the "Diagnosis and Modern
Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis."
He said that consumption 'was such a
very prevalent disease that fts discussion
should always be in order, though noth
ing new were said. He had tried tubercu
lin serum in a number of cases with some
excellent results. He had also used the
serum treatment in some cases of erysip
elas and pneumonia, and thought the
treatment valuable.
Dr. Herbert Moffltt discussed the paper
of Dr. Cole, as did Drs. J. Henry Barbot
and Philip Mills Jones. Dr. Jones and
Dr. Barbot said that they had found that
consumption could be easily diagnozed by
m.ans of the X rays. Dr. Jones had used
them also as a meth6d of treatment in
three cases, all of which improved. One
case of tuberculosis of the skin, or lupus,
was cured by the X rays. Dr. Barbol said
he had watched these cases of consump
tion ;t:id thought they were cured.
Other papers read during the day were
as follows : 'â Typhoid fever, With Death
in One Week,,' 1 by Dr. William Fitch
Cheney; "Stomach Versus Heart." by Dr.
W. J. (J. Davis of St. Helena; "Dietetics
in Diseases Affecting Nutrition," by A- J.
Sanderson of St. Helena.
Dr. George Chismore of San Francisco
exhibited an improvement on his instru
ment for crushing stone In the bladder.
Dr. Chismore has attracted attention
from all parts of the world to this Instru
ment, and its improvement now an
nounced will doubtless attract still fur
tin r attention to Dr. Chismore and San
Francisco.
Dr. MacGowan of Los Angeles reported
ten operations for "tumors of the blad
der."
As has been the case for the past few
years "politics" is one of the principal
features of the present meeting. The
candidates for president are Dre. George
Chismore of San Francisco and Thomas
Ross of Sacramento, and rumor has it
that the contest will be very close and
heated. Whether or not Monterey will
a interesting a contest :is was the
"one-round go" between Drs. MacMon

COURT ADJOURNS
FOR A FIST FIGHT
WILL your Honor kindly adjourn court for five minutes?" plaintively asked Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter
of Acting Police Judge Barry yesterday morning-.
"Why, certainly, Mr. Carpenter," replied the Judge.
Carpenter took off his eyeglasses, picked up his hat and, walking out of his Inclosure, leaned
over the railing and whispered to Attorney 1-Yi d McGregor, "Come along outside." McGregor followed the
uing Attorney, and as the door of the courtroom closed behind them Carpenter put up his "dooks" and with a
deft left hand crook caught McGregor on the point of the chin, making his teeth rattle and causing him to stagger
backward. Policeman Galloway happened to be in the vicinity, and, rushing forward, he caught hold of McGregor and
prevented further hostilities, although the attorney begged hard to be let alone so. that he could return the blow upon
the Prosecuting Attorney. Carpenter walked into the court, followed by McGregor, and coolly said: "Your Honor, I
am ready to proceed with the case," and McGregor took up his position in front of the rail as If nothing had happened.
Carpenter and McGregor have not been on speaking terms for some years. Daniel Cahill, a boy, was charged in
Acting Judge Barry's court with stealing three hams from George Reid, a grocer on Sanchez street, and McGregor
defended him. When McGregor started in to cross-examine Reid he asked: "You have no desire to prosecute this
case?" Carpenter promptly objected, and McGregor said he had no right to object. Carpenter asked McGregor to ad
dress his remarks to the court and not to him, and McGregor made a reply that angered the Prosecuting Attorney*
who said that McGregor seemed inclined to make it a personal matter. . â¢
"I am willing to make it a persona! matter," retorted McGregor, and then Carpenter suavely asked the Judge to
adjourn court for live minutes, with the result mentioned.
Judge Barry thought that Carpenter had asked for an adjournment so that he could take McGregor outside and
quietly talk the matter over, and had no idea that a fight was in prospect, otherwise he would not have adjourned court.
Carpenter refused to discuss the affair, but McGregor said that he was completely taken by surprise when Car
penter struck him, and expressed his willingness to "go him a bunch any time." The affair caused quite an excitement
In the corridor for a few minutes.
Coast used the slip for seven trips daily, i
while the Southern Pacific use amounted
to thirty-three trips a day. ......
Mr. Kruttschnitt contended that there
was a disposition to make the Southern
Pacific Company pay for the building. He
remarked that the company was har
assed by the Interstate Commissioners
on the one side, the State Railroad Com
mission on the other Bide, and now in the
middle came the Harbor Commission. He
referred to the charge fur the use of
Blips and the charge for the use of the
depot. He estimated that the companj
paid $146,000 a year, or 4 per cent interest,
on $2,000,000 for water front pnv es - ..
The Commissioners submitted that tolls ,
were re-collected from shippers and that,
the merchants in fact paid the charges. ;
Mr Foster, representing the San Fran
cisco and North Pacific Railroad entered
a protest against the proposed advance In
the rent. He maintained that the rail
roads were developing the resources of
the State, despite the opposition of trie
press. He argued that the receipts did I
not justify the Increase.
Messrs. Coleman and Russell. speaking
for the North Pacific Coast Railroad, fol
lowed the line of protest against increase
and expressed a hope that the Commis
sioners would be considerate.
After the arguments were submitted the
Commissioners voted, and the resolution
to increase the rent was unanimously
adopted. President Kilburn voted in the
affirmative along with his associates.
K!SU??SffiÃii was adopted provid
ing for the collection from the companies

Commissioner Heacock Dismiesos the
Case Against Shipping Brokers
Brown and Savory.
The charges against J. Savory and H.
Brown, shipping brokers, were dismissed
yesterday by United States Court Com
missioner Heacock. They had been ae
. of violating the allotment law â¢ n
act< d at the last session of Congress, and
their c;is<- was the first on record on this
coast it was alleged that In Bhipplng
Sailors Bvenson and McDonald they had
ted and collected a fee of $15 from
each, under the pretense that the sailors
were Indebted to them for that sum.
The prosecution was Initiated and con
ducted by the Coast Seamen's Union, an
officer of that organization attending the
examination and counseling with Assist
ant United States Attorney Woodworth.
Ex-Assistant United States Attorney Bert
Sfhlesinger had charge of the defense.
The fate of the accused men pivoted
upon the shipping articles signed by the
sailors In the office of the Hawaiian Con
sul. A clause appeareu In the articles
that the sailors owed $30 of their advance
wages, and that this debt was payable to
Brown.
It appeared from the evidence that Mr.
Brown had not appeared at all before
the Hawaiian Consul, and that the clause
had been Injected into the shipning arti
cles without the knowledge or consent of
himself or his partner, .ur. Savory. The
liants swore that McDonald and
Svenson owed them only 80 cents. an<*
that they had noi made any claim be
fore the Consul for even that sum, they
receiving their fees from the owner of the
vessel for which they were furnishing the
crew.
After the ense had been dismissed, Mr.
Brown said that the sailors were stool

THE FIGHT FOR
DECENCY GOES
BRAVELY ON
Peter Bacigalupi Is
Convicted.
MINIMUM FINE IS IMPOSED
WARNED TO BE MORE CAREFUL
IN THE FUTURE.
Acting Police Judgs Barry Declares
That the Pictures Exhibited
Were Suggestively
Immoral.
The fight for decency made by The Call
agalnnt the exhibition of indecent pic
tures In phonograph parlors has met with
another victory. Peter Bacigalupi, pro
prietor of parlors on Market street, hav
ing been convicted and fined by Acting
Police Judge Barry yesterday morning.
When the case was called Attorney
Waldheimer, for the defendant, asked the
privilege of introducing further expert
testimony as to the pictures to show that
they were not immoral.
Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter said he
had subpenaed Revs. W. I. Kip, John
llemphill, Jacob Voorsanger ami Father
Mulligan, but Dr. Hemphill and Father
Mulligan could not be found, and the
Judge had excused the other two rev
erend gentlemen from attendance. He
objected to furtner expert testimony be
ing Introduced for the defendant, as they
had had enough of that with Saloon
keeper Dunne and he thought the Judge
waa quite capable of deciding whether the
pictures were immoral or not,
The Judge said he believed that the pic
tures were suggestively immoral, and as
to the plea that they were works of art,
that was ouite absurd. The defendant
had testified that any child on deposit
ing a nickel could see the pictures In
question, and that was enough. He had
already found Collins guilty and would
also find the defendant guilty. Ho asked
would the defenuant receive his sentence
now.
Attorney Waldheimer said there ap
peared to be no use In making any argu
ment, as the Judge had made up Tils
mind.
"i have." said the Judge. "I will im
pose a Blight line this time for the reason
that I want to give you an opportunity
to change the pictures and conduct the
business carefully In the future. It is
against the law to exhibit indecent pic
tures, but in the circumstances I will im
pose the minimum fine of $10. If arrested
again for a similar offense I warn you
that I will impose tho maximum pen
alty."
Attorney Waldhoimer remarked that It
whs a case of justice going it blind, and
the Judge retorted that justice had not
been bliud In this case.
Bacigalupi had not the $10 to pay the
fine, and Prosecuting Attorney Carpenter
ordered that he be sent to prison till the
tine was paid. There was an indignant pro
test from Baciffalupl and his attorney,
but Carpenter Bald he did not intend to
make any exception in Hacigalupl's case
Some friends of Bacigalupi put up the $10
and he was saved from the indignity or
being taken to prison.
BRUTAX TREATMENT OF HORSES
Shocking Condition of the Livestock
of Gray Bros., Contractors.
The officers of the Society for the Pre
vention of Cruelty to Animals have
caused the arrest of Frank Marshall and
John White, driver and stable foreman
for Gray Bros., contractors, for being
cruel to the horses under their care.
Early In the morning: a number of com
plaints were received from people living
mar Bay street and Montgomery avenue,
which were to the effect that Gray Bros!
were using horses to pull heavy loads up
the hill that were hardly able to kÂ«-ep
their feet under them, lÂ«t alono doing
any kind of work. Secretary Hol
brook and Officer McCurry went to the
place and found the drivers whacking
along with a pair of old skates that were
afflicted with about all of the ills to
which horseflesh is heir.
Mr. Holbrook recognized the pitiful con
dition of the animals, but before proceed
ing he summoned Veterinary Surgeons
Drs. Jacobsen and Masoero, who stated
that the two horses wore over twenty
years okl and should be killed because of
their shocklDg condition. This was done
soon after. The officers then went to the
stables of tho Gray brothers and found
six more horses in similar condition
which they ordered from work. The ar
rests mentioned followed.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
STARVATION IN
PROSPECT FOR
INDIGENT SICK
County Hospital Bills
Are Unpaid.
CONTRACTORS GIVE NOTICE
FLOUR. AND FUEL MEN WANT
THEIR MONEY.
Say They Will Furnish No More
Provisions Until Funds Are
Available for Goods Al
ready Delivered.
Twelve hundred patients â¢ at the City
and County Hospital will in a few days
be confronted with the prospect of death
by starvation unless the Board of Super
visors can find some way to pay the city's
bills. Not only does the grim specter of
famine threaten the unfortunates within
the walls of the barnlike structure where
are confined the indigent sick, but their
emaciated and pain-racked bodies will be
exposed to the chill of the wind and fog
that sweeps in from the ocean through
the gap in Twin Peaks unless the coal
contractor can find a way to the city's
strong box.
Many of the merchants who have con
tracts to furnish the City and" County-
Hospital with fuel and provisions have
received no pay from the city since Feb
ruary and there is little prospect of bet
ter fortune during the balance of the
present fiscal year. In consequence of
this- the Del Monte Milling Cotnpany,
which holds the contract for supplying
the hospital with flour, meal and similar
food products, served notice yesterday
that it would decline to furnish any more
f L oods to the institution until pay is
orthcoming for goods delivered during
March and April. The same action has
been taken by Thomas J. Morton, who
holds the contract for 'supplying the hos
pital with coal. Other contractors have
signified their intention of adopting the
same course for the reason, they say,
that they cannot afford to provide the in
stitution' with goods gratis, and past ex
perience has taught thorn that there is
little prospect of remuneration when the
fund for the maintenance of the hospital
is in the condition in which they now
find it.
Until yesterday there was some pros
pect that there would be sufficient money
in the hospital fund to pay the outstand
ing bills for last month, but that hope
was killed when Auditor Wells was
advised by his attorney that the action
taken by the Board of Supervisors on
Monday was illegal. The action referred
to was" the transferring to the fund pro
vided by the last tax levy for the main
tenance of the hospital the sum of $>>ouo,
which is still to the credit of the fund
provided for repairs to the hospital. Gen
eral Dickinson yesterday advised Auditor
Wells that this transfer could not be leg
ally made, and that the only fund which
can be drawn upon for the maintenance
of the institution is that provided by the
last tax levy. Acting on this advice, the
Auditor has refused to audit demands
that would otherwise have been drawn
from this additional sum of $8000.
There now remains in the hands of the
Auditor unsatisfied March demands to the
total amount of about $3000. There is al
ready In sight demands for money due
on account of provisions furnished dur
ing the present month more than suffi
cient to exhaust the April apportionment
after the April salary demands have hern
paid. Before these April demands can be
paid the unpaid March demands must
be satisfied. It can readily be seen that
the prospect ahead for the contractors is
not encouraging.
The present condition of things at the
hospital is due to extravagance, on the
pan of the officials in charge of that in
stitution and of the Supervisors who are
responsible for the authorization of their
requisitions. It is the opinion of the offi
cials at the City Hall that a remedy must
be found for the present condition of
things, and that soon, on account of the
helpless and unfortunate condition of
those who will be the sufferers if the sup
ply of provisions and fuel is cut off.

Police Did Not Interfere With Any
thing at Ingleside Track But
the Betting.
The caso instituted by the Pacific Coast
Jockey Club against Chief of Police Lees
and his men to restrain them from enter-
Ing the grounds at Ingleslde and interfer
ing with the betting 1 on races was con
tinued before Judge Murasky yesterday.
Captain J. J. Callunden, of Morse's pa
trol, was cross-examined by " Attorney
Hosmer for the defense. He affirmed he
noticed the raids h:id resulted In a dimin
ish, -d attendance, and that the police
shoved and intimidated patrons of the
track.
W. R. Vice, an attache of the Union Pa
cific Railway, testified that after the raids
he ceased taking tourists to the track,
being afraid of arrest.
H. Mering testified to the same effect.
Secretary F. H. Green was questioned
chiefly on finances. He told of contracts
unfulfilled, and of the fifty employes,
whose monthly wage amounted to $8000.
He testified that the Jockey Club was
capitalized at $500,000.
The witness was questioned at consid
erable length during the afternoon session
by Attorney Hosmer as to interference on
the part of the police with anything at
Inglesido track except the betting. Ac
cording to his testimony the races would
have continued. The bar, the restaurant,
the candy shop, could all have continued
in business if those in authority so de
sired. The police paid no heed to them,
devoting all their attention to the betting
ring. Mr. Green said the raid of the po
lice on March 14 had deterred people from
visiting the track. The majority of those
In attendance were there to bet. and sup
pressing betting had the effect of keeping
them away. When the police arrived at
the grounds the people left the betting
ring, and many of them left the grounds
entirely.
Mr. Green, in reply to a question from
Judge Murasky, said he had advised peo
ple not to bet, as he did not want them
to violate the law. He said the club is
not interested in pool-selling nor suffering
any to be sold while the present ordi
nance is in effect. The directors have had
no meeting since this trouble commenced,
but he knew their sentiments. He has en
tire management of affairs, subject to su
pervision of the directors.
Attorneys Ach and Hosmer had several
collisions, finally drawing from Judge Mu
rasky the admonition not to be so fussy
in their trial of the case. The matter
goes on this morning at 10 o'clock.
